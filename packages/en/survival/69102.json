Its mean distance from the Earth is 237,640\r\nmiles, but as it moves in an elliptical orbit, it has at one point\r\na remoteness of 253,263 miles and opposite to this one of 221,436\r\nmiles. The diameter of the Moon is about one-fourth that of the Earth,\r\nor 2,160 miles, and its volume is 1/49 that of the Earth. The mass\r\nof the Moon (volume multiplied by density) is 1/81 and the density\r\n⅗ that of the Earth. The period of the Moon's revolution about the\r\nEarth is 27 days, 7 hours, 43 minutes and 11½ seconds. As its period\r\nof rotation on its axis is the same, only one side of the Moon is ever\r\nseen from the Earth. Since, however, the Moon's axis is inclined about\r\n83° to the plane of its orbit, we sometimes see a little distance\r\nbeyond each of its poles, and, since the rate of motion of the Moon\r\nin its orbit varies slightly, we sometimes see a little beyond the\r\neastern and western edges of the hemisphere. The total result of these\r\n_librations_, as they are called, is to make four-sevenths of the\r\nMoon's surface visible to us. Of the remaining three-sevenths, nothing\r\nis known. So far as is known, the Moon is not flattened at the poles.\r\n\r\nOwing to its slow rotation on its axis, the Moon's day has a length of\r\n29½ of our days. Each portion of its surface is therefore exposed to or\r\nshielded from the light of the Sun for a fortnight continuously.\r\n\r\nThe Moon has no atmosphere. Hence, it can have no diffused light, and\r\nnothing can be seen on it except where the Sun's rays shine directly.\r\n\"If a man stepped into the shadow of a lunar crag,\" says Todd, \"he\r\nwould instantly become invisible. For a similar reason, no sound,\r\nhowever loud, can be heard on the Moon. The rolling of a rock down the\r\nwall of a lunar crater, will be known only by the tremor it produces.\"\r\nMoreover, changes of temperature on the Moon are rapid and violent.\r\nWhere the Sun's rays strike, a temperature about that of boiling water\r\nis believed to be reached, while in unilluminated portions it is\r\nthought to go as low as 100° below zero.\r\n\r\nThe force of gravity upon the surface of the Moon is only ⅙ of that on\r\nthe Earth. Therefore, a man weighing 150 pounds on the Earth, would\r\nweigh only 25 pounds on the Moon, and the same muscular energy by which\r\nhe could jump 6 feet on the Earth would carry him a distance of 36 feet\r\non the Moon. On the Earth a body falls 16 feet in one second; on the\r\nMoon only 2.6 feet in the same time.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the Moon is made up of mountains, valleys and plains,\r\nresembling in general appearance those of the Earth. As a whole,\r\nhowever, the surface of the Moon is much more uneven than that of the\r\nEarth. Some of the mountains of the Moon have a height of over 20,000\r\nfeet. As there is no sea-level to measure from, this figure expresses\r\nheight above the surrounding surface, it being determined by the length\r\nof the shadows cast by the mountains.\r\n\r\nIn order to represent in a vivid and accurate manner the character and\r\nappearance of the Moon's surface, the construction of a large model of\r\nthe Moon was undertaken a number of years ago by Th. Dickert, Curator\r\nof the Natural History Museum of Bonn, Germany and Dr. J. F. Julius\r\nSchmidt, Director of the Observatory of Athens, Greece and an eminent\r\nselenographer. The model was presented to the Museum by the late Lewis\r\nReese of Chicago, and is installed at the west end of Hall 35 of the\r\nMuseum. The model is 19.2 feet in diameter, and is by far the largest\r\nand most elaborate representation of the Moon's surface ever made. Its\r\nhorizontal scale is 1:600,000, one inch on the model equaling 9-47/100\r\nmiles on the surface of the Moon, and its vertical scale is 1:200,000,\r\none inch equaling 3-15/100 miles on the Moon.\r\n\r\nSome characteristic features of the Moon's surface which are especially\r\nwell illustrated on the model are the following:\r\n\r\n1. GRAY PLAINS or \"SEAS.\" These are the darker portions of the Moon's\r\nsurface as it is seen with the naked eye. They were thought by earlier\r\nobservers to be seas and were so named. We now know, however, that\r\nthere is no water on the Moon's surface and that the so-called \"seas\"\r\nare really low-land plains, some of them of vast extent. The Oceanus\r\nProcellarum, for instance, covers an area of 90,000 square miles.\r\nAs seen from the Earth, the plains show a gray-green color, often\r\nof varying intensity and sometimes a little bluish in portions. The\r\nbrightest green color is shown by the area known as Mare Serenitatis.\r\nThough appearing perfectly level, a close study shows that these plains\r\nhave undulating surfaces. They occupy about one-third of the visible\r\nsurface of the Moon.\r\n\r\n2. MOUNTAINS and HIGHLANDS. These constitute the bright portions of the\r\nMoon's surface as it is seen with the naked eye.\r\n\r\nAlthough these elevated areas are conveniently called mountains, Shaler\r\nhas drawn attention to the fact that they are unlike those on the\r\nEarth since they lack features due to erosion and there is absence of\r\norder in their association. The average declivity of their slopes is\r\nalso much greater than that of the mountains on the Earth. It has been\r\nestimated that the average angle of the lunar surface to its horizon is\r\n52°, while on the Earth it does not amount to more than one-tenth of\r\nthat figure. This difference is probably due to the lack of water on\r\nthe Moon, the work of which on the Earth tends continually to reduce\r\nslopes to a level. Using the term mountains for convenience, however,\r\nthose on the Moon may be divided into the following classes:\r\n\r\n_a._ MOUNTAIN CHAINS. These may have a length of 80 to 100 miles and\r\nheights of from 5,000 to 17,000 feet. As in the case with the mountains\r\nof the Earth, they are usually steeper on one side than on the other.\r\nThe range called the Appenines, seen near the north pole of the Moon,\r\nis a good illustration of such mountain chains. Other ranges are the\r\nso-called Alps and Caucasus. These names were applied by Hevelius, an\r\nastronomer of Danzig, who made the first map of the Moon in 1647. He\r\ngave to the features of the Moon's surface names of localities similar\r\nto those on the Earth which they most resembled. His system was largely\r\nabandoned by later astronomers, however, the later method being to name\r\nthe different features of the Moon after celebrated astronomers and\r\nphilosophers.\r\n\r\n_b._ HIGHLANDS SURROUNDED BY MOUNTAINS. These are partly with and\r\npartly without well-determined directions.\r\n\r\n_c._ ISOLATED MOUNTAINS. These usually occur on the gray plains. They\r\nvary from 4,000 to 7,000 feet in height.\r\n\r\n_d._ VEIN MOUNTAINS. These occur only on the gray plains. They are\r\nlong, narrow, contorted ridges, usually from 700 to 1,000 feet in\r\nheight.\r\n\r\n_e._ CIRCULAR MOUNTAINS. These are the most characteristic and peculiar\r\nfeatures of the Moon's surface. They vary in size from the so-called\r\n\"Walled Plains,\" 150 to 15 miles in diameter, to crater mountains whose\r\ndiameters range from 15 miles down to a few hundred feet. Thirty-three\r\nthousand of these crater mountains have been counted by one astronomer,\r\nthe number increasing as the size diminishes.\r\n\r\nThe form of these craters is that of pits, which generally have\r\nring-like walls about them. These wails slope very steeply to a central\r\ncavity and more gently toward the surrounding country. In all these\r\npits, as pointed out by Shaler, except those of the smallest size,\r\nand possibly in these, also, there is, within the ring wall and at a\r\nconsiderable though variable depth below its summit, a nearly flat\r\nfloor, which often has a central pit of small size or, in its place,\r\na steep cone. When this floor is more than 20 miles in diameter, and\r\nin increasing numbers as it is wider, there are generally other pits\r\nand cones irregularly scattered upon it. Thus, within the ring called\r\nPlato, which is about 60 miles in diameter, there are some scores of\r\nthese lesser pits. On the interior of the ring walls of the pits over\r\n10 miles in diameter, there are usually more or less distinct terraces,\r\nwhich suggest that the material now forming the solid floors they\r\ninclose was once fluid and stood at greater heights in the pit than\r\nthat at which it became permanently frozen. It is, indeed, tolerably\r\ncertain that the last movement of this material of the floors was one\r\nof interrupted subsidence from an originally greater elevation on\r\nthe outside of the ring wall. The ring wall is commonly of irregular\r\nheight, with many peaks. In some places there may be seen tongues or\r\nprotrusions of the substance which forms the ring, as if it had flowed\r\na short distance and then had cooled with steep slopes. It may also\r\nbe noted: (_a_) that the pits or craters in many instances intersect\r\neach other, showing that they were not all formed at the same time,\r\nbut in succession; (_b_) that the larger of them are not found on the\r\nplains (seas) but on the upland and apparently the older parts of the\r\nsurface; and (_c_) that the evidence from the intersections clearly\r\nindicates that the larger of these structures are prevailingly the\r\nolder and that in general the smallest were the latest formed. In other\r\nwords, says Shaler, whatever was the nature of the action involved in\r\nthe production of the craters, its energy diminished with time, until\r\nin the end it could no longer break the crust. These features indicate\r\nthat the surface of the Moon has been subject to forces similar to\r\nthose which produce volcanoes on the Earth, and it is therefore\r\ncustomary to refer to the crater-like mountains of the Moon as\r\nvolcanoes. As the parallel cannot be drawn too closely, however, Shaler\r\nhas urged that the term vulcanoids, meaning volcano-like, be applied to\r\nthese mountains.\r\n\r\n3. RILLS or CLEFTS. These are small, deep, ditch-like furrows to be\r\nfound over various parts of the Moon's surface. Their course seems\r\nquite independent of the surface topography, for they traverse\r\nmountains and plains with equal facility. They are without doubt the\r\nlatest formation on the Moon and some of them may have had their origin\r\nin modern times.\r\n\r\n4. BRIGHT STREAKS. These radiate prominently from many of the great\r\ncraters of the Moon. They are streaks of narrow width but sometimes\r\nnearly a hundred miles in length. They are perhaps the most puzzling\r\nof all the Moon's features. They have been supposed by some observers\r\nto represent lava flows whose surface reflected light more brilliantly\r\nthan other portions of the Moon. It is more generally believed,\r\nhowever, that the streaks do not represent any independent elevations,\r\nsince they run over the highest mountains as well as through the\r\ndeepest craters without variation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL OBSERVATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe condition of the Moon's surface as a whole indicates that it has\r\nbeen a theater of extraordinary volcanic activity. In size and number\r\nits vulcanoids far exceed the volcanoes of the Earth. The largest\r\nterrestrial crater known is that of Kilauea in the Hawaiian Islands\r\nwhich is 2½ miles in diameter. Several craters of the Moon, however,\r\nexceed 50 miles in diameter and one measures 114¼ miles. While the\r\nabsolute heights of the mountains of the Moon do not greatly exceed\r\nthose of the Earth, proportionally they are much higher, since the\r\nMoon's diameter is only one-fourth that of the Earth. The vulcanoids\r\nof the Moon differ in other respects from the volcanoes of our globe.\r\n\"On the Earth they are usually openings on the summits or sides of\r\nmountains--on the Moon, depressions below the adjacent surface even\r\nwhen it is a plain or valley; on the Earth the mass of the cone usually\r\nfar exceeds the capacity of the crater--on the Moon they are much\r\nnearer equality; on the Earth they are commonly the sources of long\r\nlava streams--on the Moon, traces of such outpourings are rare.\" (Webb.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF INDIVIDUAL FEATURES.\r\n\r\n(Abridged from Nasmyth and Carpenter.)\r\n\r\nThe numbers refer to those on the accompanying chart.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPERNICUS. 147. This may deservedly be considered one of the grandest\r\nand most instructive of lunar craters. Though its diameter (46 miles)\r\nis exceeded by that of other craters, its situation near the center\r\nof the lunar disc renders it so conspicuous as to make it a favorite\r\nobject for observation. Its vast rampart rises to upwards of 12,000\r\nfeet above the level of the plateau, nearly in the center of which\r\nstands a magnificent group of cones attaining the height of upwards\r\nof 2400 feet. The rampart is divided by concentric segmented terraced\r\nridges, which present every appearance of being enormous landslips,\r\nresulting from the crushing of their overloaded summits which have\r\nslid down in vast segments and scattered their debris on the plateau.\r\nCorresponding vacancies in the rampart may be observed from whence\r\nthese prodigious masses have broken away. The same may be noticed, to\r\na somewhat modified degree, around the exterior of the rampart. For\r\nupwards of 70 miles around Copernicus myriads of comparatively minute\r\nbut perfectly formed craters can be seen. The district on the southeast\r\nside is especially rich in them. Many somewhat radial ridges or spurs\r\nmay be observed leading away from the exterior banks of the great\r\nrampart. They appear to be due to the freer egress which the extruded\r\nmatter found near the focus of disruption.\r\n\r\nTRIESNECKER. 150. A fine example of a normal lunar volcanic crater\r\nhaving all the usual characteristic features in great perfection.\r\nIts diameter is about 20 miles and it possesses a good example of\r\nthe central cone and also of interior terracing. The most notable\r\nfeature, however, is the remarkable display of cracks or chasms which\r\nmay be seen to the west side of it. Several of these cracks obviously\r\ndiverge from near the west external bank of the great crater and they\r\nsub-divide or branch out as they extend from the apparent point of\r\ndivergence, while they are crossed or intersected by others. These\r\ncracks or chasms are nearly one mile wide at their widest part and\r\nafter extending for fully 100 miles taper away till they become\r\ninvisible.\r\n\r\nTHEOPHILUS. 97. CYRILLUS. 96. CATHARINA. 95. These three magnificent\r\ncraters form a conspicuous group. Their diameters and depths are as\r\nfollows: Theophilus, diameter, 64 miles; depth of interior plateau\r\nfrom summit of crater wall, 16,000 feet; central cone, 5200 feet high;\r\nCyrillus, diameter, 60 miles; depth of interior plateau from summit\r\nof crater wall, 15,000 feet; central cone, 5800 feet high; Catharina,\r\ndiameter, 65 miles; depth of interior plateau from summit of crater\r\nwall, 13,000 feet; center of plateau occupied by a confused group of\r\nminor craters and debris. Each of these craters is full of interesting\r\ndetails presenting in every variety the characteristic features of the\r\nlunar volcanoes and giving unmistakable evidence of the tremendous\r\nenergy which at some remote period piled up such gigantic formations.\r\nThe intrusion of Theophilus within Cyrillus shows that it is of more\r\nrecent formation than the latter. The flanks of Theophilus, especially\r\non the west side, are studded with apparently minute craters. These\r\nwould be considered of great size but for the enormous crater so near.\r\n\r\nPTOLEMY. 111. ALPHONS. 110. ARZACHAEL. 84. The portion of the moon's\r\nsurface which includes these features, being near the center of the\r\nlunar disc, is exceptionally well placed for observation. Within\r\nthis area may be seen every variety of volcanic craters and a number\r\nof other interesting forms. Ptolemy belongs to the class of walled\r\nplains, its ramparts enclosing a plain 86 miles in diameter. Alphons\r\nand Arzachael are respectively 60 and 55 miles in diameter. They have\r\nall the distinctive features of lunar craters, viz:--central cones,\r\nlofty, ragged ramparts, manifestations of landslip formations in the\r\ngreat segmental terraces within their ramparts and minor craters\r\ninterpolated within their plateaus. A notable object near Alphons is\r\nan enormous straight cliff traversing the diameter of a low, ridged,\r\ncircular formation. This great cliff is 60 miles long and from 1000 to\r\n2000 feet high. It is a well known object to lunar observers and has\r\nbeen termed \"The Railway\" on account of its straightness. The existence\r\nof this remarkable cliff appears to be due either to an upheaval or a\r\ndown-sinking of a portion of the surface of the circular area across\r\nwhose diameter it extends.\r\n\r\nTYCHO. 80. This magnificent crater is 54 miles in diameter and upwards\r\nof 16,000 feet deep from the highest ridge of the rampart to the\r\nsurface of the plateau. It is one of the most conspicuous of lunar\r\ncraters, not so much on account of its dimensions as from its occupying\r\nthe great focus of disruption from whence diverge those remarkable\r\nbright streaks many of which may be traced over 1000 miles of the\r\nmoon's surface. The interior of the crater presents striking examples\r\nof the concentric, terrace-like formations that are regarded as formed\r\nby landslips.\r\n\r\nWARGENTIN. 26. SCHICKARD. 28. Wargentin is an object quite unique of\r\nits kind--a crater about 52 miles across, that to all appearance has\r\nbeen filled to the brim with lava that has been left to consolidate.\r\nThere are evidences of the remains of a rampart, especially on the\r\nsouthwest portion of the rim. The general aspect of Wargentin has been\r\ncompared to that of a \"thin cheese.\" The terraced and rutted exterior\r\nof the rampart has all the details of a true crater. The surface of\r\nthe high plateau is marked by a few ridges branching from a point\r\nnearly in the center.\r\n\r\nSchickard is one of the finest examples of a walled plain. It is 153\r\nmiles in diameter. Within its rampart are 16 smaller craters and\r\nwithout, numberless others.\r\n\r\nThe following are the names of topographic features of the Moon which\r\ncan be located by the corresponding numbers on the accompanying chart.\r\n\r\n    1.

AFTER NASMYTH.\r\n\r\nThe figures refer to the names given on pp. 11 and 12 and the use of\r\nthe chart with the model will enable the reader to name the different\r\nfeatures of the moon.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINTED BY FIELD MUSEUM PRESS\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber Note\r\n\r\nThe list of \"topographic features\" (pp. 11-12) have some numbers\r\nmissing (115, 116) and a comparison with Nasmyth and Carpenter's The\r\nMoon was missing those numbers but several other numbers were repeated.\r\nThe repeated numbers appear to represent craters too close to split out.",
