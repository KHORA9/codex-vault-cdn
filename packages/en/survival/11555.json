MEAD,\r\nEDITOR OF THE HORTICULTURIST.\r\n\r\n1860\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface to the Twelfth London Edition.\r\n\r\nThis little volume has been received with so much favor, both by the\r\npublic and the press, that I cannot refrain from expressing my\r\ngratitude for the kind treatment I have experienced. From many of the\r\ncriticisms which have appeared respecting \"Our Farm of Four Acres,\" I\r\nhave received not only complimentary remarks, but likewise some useful\r\nhints on the subjects of which I have written. With the praise comes\r\nsome little censure; and I am charged by more than one friendly critic\r\nwith stupidity for not ordering the legs of our first cow to be\r\nstrapped, which would, they consider, have prevented both milk and\r\nmilker from being knocked over. Now this was done, but the animal had\r\na way of knocking the man and pail down with her side; every means was\r\ntried, but nothing succeeded till her calf was parted with. We have\r\nbeen asked whether we had to keep gates, hedges, &c., in repair, or\r\nwhether it was done at the expense of the landlord. As far as regarded\r\nthe gates and buildings, that gentleman was bound by agreement to keep\r\nthem in order, and as for hedges we have none. A stream runs round the\r\nmeadows, and forms the boundary of our small domain. Since our little\r\nwork was written we have had nearly eighteen months' further\r\nexperience, and have as much reason now as then to be satisfied with\r\nthe profits we receive from our four acres. I must add a few words\r\nconcerning our butter-making. Some doubts have been expressed relative\r\nto our power of churning for four hours at a time. Now it certainly\r\nwas not pleasant, but it was not the hard work that some people\r\nimagine: fatiguing certainly; but then H. and myself took it, as\r\nchildren say, \"turn and turn about.\" We did not entrust the churn to\r\nTom, because he was liable to be called away to perform some of his\r\nmany duties. Had we not had the toil, we should not have acquired the\r\nknowledge which now enables us to complete our work in three-quarters\r\nof an hour. We have been pitied for being always employed, and told\r\nthat we can never know the luxury of leisure. We answer this remark\r\nwith the words of \"Poor Richard,\" that \"leisure is the time for doing\r\nsomething useful.\"\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\nTO THE AMERICAN EDITION.\r\n\r\nThis little volume will possess rare interest for all who own a\r\n\"four-acre farm,\" or, indeed, a farm of any number of acres. Its chief\r\nvalue to the American reader does not consist in its details of\r\npractice, but in the enunciation and demonstration of certain\r\nprinciples of domestic economy of universal application. The practice\r\nof terra-culture must be varied to meet the different conditions of\r\nsoil and climate under which it is pursued; but sound general\r\nprinciples hold good everywhere, and only need the exercise of\r\nordinary judgment and common sense for their application to our own\r\nwants. This is now better understood than heretofore, and hence we are\r\nbetter prepared to profit by draughts from the fount of universal\r\nknowledge. We would not be understood as intimating, however, that\r\nonly the general principles set forth in this little book are of value\r\nto us; the details of making butter and bread, feeding stock, etc.,\r\nare just as useful to us as to the English reader. The two chapters on\r\nmaking butter and bread are admirable in their way, and alone are\r\nworth the price of the book. So, too, of domestics and their\r\nmanagement; we have to go through pretty much the same vexations,\r\nprobably a little intensified, as there is among us a more rampant\r\nspirit of independence on the part of servants; but many of these\r\nvexations may be avoided, we have no doubt, by following the\r\nsuggestion of our author, of procuring \"country help\" for the country.\r\nDomestics accustomed to city life not only lack the requisite\r\nknowledge, but are unwilling to learn, and will not readily adapt\r\nthemselves to the circumstances in which they are placed; in fact, the\r\nmajority of them \"know too much,\" and are altogether too impatient of\r\ncontrol. A woman, however, must be mistress in her own house; this is\r\nindispensable to economy and comfort; and the plan adopted by our\r\nauthor will often secure this when all others fail.\r\n\r\nWe have not deemed it advisable to add anything in the way of notes;\r\nwe have made a few alterations in the text to adapt it better to the\r\nwants of the American reader, and for the same reason we have altered\r\nthe English currency to our own. In other respects the work remains\r\nintact. In some works of this kind notes would have been\r\nindispensable, but in the present case we have thought we could safely\r\ntrust to the judgment of the reader to appropriate and adapt the\r\ngeneral principles set forth, leaving the application of details to\r\nthe shrewdness and strong common sense characteristic of the American\r\nmind. The object of the work is rather to demonstrate a general\r\nprinciple than to furnish all the minutiae of practice, though enough\r\nof these are given to serve the purpose of illustration. The American\r\nreader will not fail, of course, to make due allowance for the\r\ndifference of rent, prices, etc., between this country and England,\r\nand the matter of adaptation then becomes a very simple affair.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion we present the work as a model in style.  It is written\r\nwith a degree of simplicity which makes it readily understood, and is\r\na fine specimen of good old Anglo-Saxon. Portions of it are fully as\r\ninteresting as a romance. It is written by a lady, which fact gives it\r\nan additional interest and value as a contribution to the economy of\r\ncountry life, in which it may be admitted that women are our masters.\r\nThe incidents connected that women are our masters. The incidents\r\nconnected with hiring \"our farm of four acres\" are related in a\r\nlife-like manner, and will be appreciated by our own May-day hunting\r\ncountry-women, who, we trust, will also appreciate the many important\r\nfacts set forth in this little volume, which we heartily commend to\r\nthem and to all others, with the wish that it may be as useful and\r\npopular as it has been at home.\r\n\r\n                             P.B.M.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP.\r\nI.--WHERE SHALL WE LIVE?\r\nII.--OUR FIRST DIFFICULTY.\r\nIII.--OUR SECOND COW.\r\nIV--HOW TO MAKE BUTTER.\r\nV.--WHAT WE MADE BY OUR COWS.\r\nVI.--OUR PIGS.\r\nVII.--OUR POULTRY.\r\nVIII.--OUR LOSSES.\r\nIX.--OUR PIGEONS.\r\nX.--HOW WE CURED OUR HAMS.\r\nXI.--OUR BREAD.\r\nXII.--OUR KITCHEN-GARDEN.\r\nXIII--THE MONEY WE MADE.\r\nXIV.--THE NEXT SIX MONTHS.\r\nXV.--OUR PONY.\r\nXVL.--CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOUR FARM OF FOUR ACRES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nWHERE SHALL WE LIVE?\r\n\r\n\"Where shall we live?\"  That was a question asked by the sister of the\r\nwriter, when it became necessary to leave London, and break up a once\r\nhappy home, rendered desolate sudden bereavement.\r\n\r\n\"Ah! Where, indeed?\" was the answer.  \"Where can we hope to find a\r\nhouse which will be suitable for ourselves, six children, and a small\r\nincome?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" answered H., \"there can be no difficulty about that.  Send for\r\nthe 'Times' and we shall find dozens of places that will do for us.\"\r\nSo that mighty organ of information was procured, and its columns\r\neagerly searched.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said I, \"what sort of place do we really mean to take?\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" replied H., \"is soon settled.  We must have a good-sized\r\ndining-room, small drawing-room, and a breakfast-room, which may be\r\nconverted into a school-room. It must have a nursery and five good\r\nbed-chambers, a chaise-house, and stable for the pony and carriage, a\r\nlarge garden, and three or four acres of land, for we must keep a cow.\r\nIt must not be more than eight miles from 'town,' or two from a\r\nstation; it must be in a good neighborhood, and it must--\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop! Stop!\" cried I; \"how much do you intend to give a-year for all\r\nthese conveniences:\"\r\n\r\n\"How much?\"  Why, I should say we ought not to give more than $250.\"\r\n\r\n\"We ought not,\" said I, gravely, \"but I greatly fear we shall for that\r\namount have to put up with a far inferior home to the one you\r\ncontemplate. But come, let us answer a few of these advertisements;\r\nsome of them depict the very place you wish for.\"\r\n\r\nSo after selecting those which, when they had described in bright\r\ncolors the houses to be let, added, \"Terms very moderate,\" we\r\n\"presented compliments\" to Messrs. A., B., C., D., and in due time\r\nreceived cards to view the \"desirable country residences\" we had\r\nwritten about. But our hopes of becoming the fortunate occupants of\r\nany one of those charming abodes were soon dashed to the ground; for\r\nwith the cards came the terms; and we found that a \"very moderate\r\nrental\" meant from $600 to $750 per annum. We looked at each other\r\nrather ruefully; and the ungenerous remark of \"I told you so\" rose to\r\nmy lips. However, I did not give it utterance, but substituted the\r\nwords, \"Never mind, let us send for another 'Times,' and only answer\r\nthose advertisements which state plainly the rent required.\" This time\r\nwe enlarged our ideas on the subjects of rent and distance, and\r\nresolved that if that beautiful place _near_ Esher would suit us, we\r\nwould not mind giving $300 a-year for it.\r\n\r\nIn a few days arrived answers to our last inquiries.  We fixed on the\r\none which appeared the most eligible, but were a little dismayed to\r\nfind that \"near Esher\" meant six miles from the station.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" said H., resolutely, \"the pony can take us to it in fine\r\nweather, and in winter we must not want to go to London.\"\r\n\r\nWe started the next morning by rail, and found the \"Cottage\" almost as\r\npretty as it had appeared on paper. But, alas! it been let the day\r\nprevious to our arrival, and we had to return to town minus five\r\ndollars for our expenses.\r\n\r\nThe next day, nothing daunted,--indeed, rather encouraged by finding\r\nthe house we had seen really equal to our expectations,--we set off to\r\nview another \"villa,\" which, from the particulars we had received from\r\nthe agent, appeared quite as attractive. This time we found the place\r\ntenantless; and, as far as we were concerned, it would certainly\r\nremain so. It had been represented as a \"highly-desirable country\r\nresidence, and quite ready for the reception of a family of\r\nrespectability.\" It was dignified with the appellation of \"Middlesex\r\nHall,\" and we were rather surprised when we found that this\r\nhigh-sounding name signified a mean-looking place close to the road;\r\nand when the door was opened for our admission, that we stepped at\r\nonce from the small front court into the drawing-room, from which a\r\ndoor opened into a stone kitchen. The rest of the accommodation\r\ncorresponded with this primitive mode of entrance; the whole place was\r\nin what is commonly called a \"tumble-down\" condition: there was\r\ncertainly plenty of garden, and two large meadows, but, like the rest\r\nof the place, they were sadly out of order. When we said it was not at\r\nall the house we had expected to find from reading the advertisement,\r\nwe asked what sort of house we expected to get for $300 with five\r\nacres of land. Now that was a question we could not have answered had\r\nwe not seen the pretty cottage with nearly as much ground at Esher;\r\nhowever, we did not give the owner the benefit of our experience, but\r\nmerely said that the house would not suit us, and drove back four\r\nmiles to the station, rather out of spirits with the result of our\r\nday's work.\r\n\r\nFor more than a fortnight did we daily set forth on this voyage of\r\ndiscovery. One day we started with a card to view \"a delightful\r\nCottage Ornee, situated four miles from Weybridge;\" this time the rent\r\nwas still higher than any we had previously seen. When we arrived at\r\nthe village in which the house was represented to be, we asked for\r\n\"Heathfield House,\" and were told that no one knew of any residence\r\nbearing that name; we were a little perplexed, and consulted the card\r\nof admittance to see whether we had brought the wrong one--but no;\r\nthere it was, \"Heathfield House,\" four miles from Weybridge,\r\nsurrounded by its own grounds of four acres, tastefully laid out in\r\nlawn, flower and kitchen-gardens, &c, &c. Rent only $350. We began to\r\nimagine that we were the victims of some hoax, and were just on the\r\npoint of telling the driver to return to the station, when a\r\ndirty-looking man came to the carriage, and said, \"Are you looking for\r\nHeathfield House?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said we.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'll show it to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it far?\" we asked; as no sign of a decent habitation was to be\r\nseen near us.\r\n\r\n\"No; just over the way,\" was the answer.\r\n\r\nWe looked in the direction he indicated, and saw a \"brick carcase:\r\nstanding on a bare, heath piece of ground, without enclosure of any\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n\"That!\" cried we; \"it is impossible that can be the place we came to\r\nsee!\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you got a card from Mr.--?\" was the query addressed to us.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" was the reply.\r\n\r\n\"Very well; then if you will get out I'll show it to you.\"\r\n\r\nAs we had come so far we thought we might as well finish the\r\nadventure, and accordingly followed our guide over the piece of rough\r\nmuddy ground which led to the brick walls before us. We found them on\r\na neared inspection quite as empty as they appeared from the road;\r\nneither doors nor windows were placed in them, and the staircases were\r\nnot properly fixed. It was with much trouble we succeeded in reaching\r\nthe floor where the bed-chambers were to be, and found that not even\r\nthe boards were laid down. We told our conductor, that the place would\r\nnot suit us, as we were compelled to remove from our present residence\r\nin three weeks.\r\n\r\n\"Well, if that's all that hinders your taking it, I'll engage to get\r\nit all ready in that time.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! get the staircases fixed, the doors and windows put in, the\r\nwalls papered and painted?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" was answered, in a confident tone, which expressed indignation\r\nat the doubt we had implied.\r\n\r\nWe then ventured to say, that, \"Allowing he could get the house ready\r\nby the time we required to move, we saw no sign of the coach-house and\r\nstable, lawn or flower-garden, kitchen or meadow.\"\r\n\r\n\"As for the coach-house and stable,\" said the showman, \"I can get your\r\nhorses put up in the village.\"\r\n\r\nWe hastened to disclaim the _horses_, and humbly confessed that our\r\nstud consisted of one pony only.\r\n\r\n\"The less reason to be in a hurry for the stable, for you can put one\r\npony anywhere; and as for the lawn and gardens, they will be laid out\r\nwhen the house is let; and the heath will be levelled and sown for a\r\nmeadow, and anything else done for a good tenant that is in reason.\"\r\n\r\nWe were likewise assured that wonders had been done already, for that\r\nfour months ago the ground was covered with furze. We got rid of our\r\ntalkative friend with the promise that we would \"think of it;\" and\r\nindeed, we _did_ think, that Mr.--, who was a very respectable\r\nhouse-agent, ought to ascertain what sort of places were place in his\r\nhands before he sent people on such profitless journeys. The expense\r\nattending this one amounted to nearly eight dollars.\r\n\r\nAnother week as passed in a similar manner, in going distances varying\r\nfrom ten to twenty-five miles daily in pursuit of houses which we were\r\ninduced to think must suit us, but when seen proved as deceptive a\r\nthose I have mentioned. We gained nothing by our travels but the loss\r\nof time, money, and hope. At last the idea entered our heads of going\r\nto some of the house-agents, and looking over their books.\r\n\r\nOur first essay was at the office of Mr. A. B., in Bond street.  \"Have\r\nyou any houses to let at such a distance from town, with such a\r\nquantity of land, such a number of rooms?\" &c.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes madam,\" said the smiling clerk, and immediately opened a\r\nlarge ledger; \"what rent do you propose giving?\"\r\n\r\n\"From $250 to $350 yearly,\" answered we, and felt how respectable we\r\nmust appear in the opinion of the smart gentleman whom we addressed;\r\nhow great then was our surprise when he closed his large volume with a\r\ncrash, and with a look of supreme contempt said, \"_We_ have nothing of\r\nthat kind in _our_ books.\" To use one of Fanny Kemble's expressions,\r\n\"we felt mean,\" and left the office of this aristocratical house-agent\r\nhalf ashamed of our humble fortunes.\r\n\r\nI fear I should tire the patience of the reader, did I detail all our\r\n\"adventures in search of a house,\" but we must entreat indulgence for\r\nour last journey. We once more started on the South-Western line, to\r\nsee a house which, from the assurances we had received from the owner,\r\nresident in London, must a last be _the_ house, and for which the rent\r\nasked was $350; but once more were we doomed to disappointment by\r\nfinding that the \"handsome dining and drawing-rooms\" were two small\r\nparlors, with doors opening into each other; and that \"five excellent\r\nbed-chambers\" were three small rooms and two wretched attics.\r\n\r\nFrom the station to this place was four miles; and, as weary and\r\nhopeless we were returning to it, it occurred to H. to ask the driver\r\nif he knew of any houses to let in the vicinity. He considered, then\r\nsaid he only knew of one, which had been vacant some time, and that\r\nparties who had been to see it would not take it because it was\r\nsituated in a bad neighborhood.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of our search that would have been quite\r\nsufficient to have deterred us from looking at it, but we could not\r\nnow afford to be fastidious. Our own house was let, and move from it\r\nwe must in less than a fortnight; so we desired the driver to take us\r\ninto this bad neighborhood, and were rewarded for the additional\r\ndistance we travelled by finding an old-fashioned, but very convenient\r\nhouse, with plenty of good-sized rooms in excellent repair, a very\r\npretty flower-garden, with greenhouse, good kitchen-garden of on acre,\r\nan orchard of the same extent well stocked with fine fruit-trees,\r\nthree acres of good meadow-land, an excellent coach-house and\r\nstabling, with houses for cows, pigs, and poultry, all in good order.\r\n\r\nThe \"bad neighborhood\" was not so very bad.  The cottages just outside\r\nthe gates were small, new buildings; and once inside, you saw nothing\r\nbut your own grounds. It possessed the advantage of being less than\r\ntwo miles from a station, and not more than twelve from London.\r\n\r\n\"This will do,\" we both exclaimed, \"if the rent is not too high.\"\r\n\r\nWe had been asked $600 for much inferior places; so that it was with\r\ngreat anxiety we directed our civil driver to take us to the party who\r\nhad the disposal of the house. When there, we met with the welcome\r\nintelligence, that house, gardens, orchard, meadows, and buildings,\r\nwere all included in a rental of $370 per annum. We concluded the\r\nbargain there and then, and on that day fortnight took possession of\r\n\"Our Farm of Four Acres.\"\r\n\r\nBefore we close this chapter, we will address a few words to such of\r\nour readers as may entertain the idea that houses in the country may\r\nbe had \"for next to nothing.\" We had repeatedly heard this asserted,\r\nand when we resolved to give $300 a year, we thought that we should\r\nhave no difficulty in meeting with a respectable habitation for that\r\nsum, large enough for our family and with the quantity of land we\r\nrequired, as well as within a moderate distance of London. We have\r\nalready told the reader how fallacious we found this hope to be.\r\nHouses within forty or fifty miles of London, in what are called \"good\r\nsituations,\" are nearly, if not quite as high rented, as those in the\r\nsuburbs, and land worth quite as much. If at any time a \"cheap place\"\r\nis to be met with, be quite sure that there is some drawback to\r\ncompensate for the low price.\r\n\r\nIn our pilgrimages to empty houses, we frequently found some which\r\nwere low-rented, that is from $200 $250 per annum; but either they\r\nwere much smaller than we required, or dreadfully out of repair, or\r\nelse they were built \"Cockney fashion,\" semi-detached, or, as was\r\nfrequently the case, situated in a locality which for some reason or\r\nother was highly objectionable. We always found rents lower in\r\nproportion to the distance from a station.\r\n\r\nWe one day went to Beaconsfield to view a house, and had a fly from\r\nSlough, a drive of several miles. The house was in the middle of the\r\ntown, large and convenient, with good garden and paddock; the whole\r\nwas offered us for $200 yearly; and we should have taken it, had it\r\nnot been in such a dismantled condition that the agent in whose hands\r\nit was placed informed us that though he had orders to put it in\r\ncomplete repair, he would not promise it would be fit for occupation\r\nunder several months. The office of this gentleman was next door to\r\nMr. A. B.'s, in Bond street; and we are bound to state, that though we\r\nsaid that we did not wish to give more than $300, we were treated with\r\nrespect; and several offered us under these terms, though attended\r\nwith circumstances which prevented our availing ourselves of them.\r\n\r\nThe house we at last found was not, as regarded situation, what we\r\nliked; not because of the cottages close to the entrance, but for the\r\nreason that there was no \"view,\" but from the top windows; as far as\r\nthe lower part of the house was concerned, we might as well have been\r\nin the Clapham Road. It is true we looked into gardens, front and\r\nback, but that was all; and we had to go through two or three streets\r\nof the little town in which we were located whenever we left the house\r\nfor a walk. Still we were, on the whole, well pleased with our new\r\nhome, and in the next chapter will tell the reader how we commenced a\r\nlife so different to that we had been accustomed to lead.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nOUR FIRST DIFFICULTY.\r\n\r\nOnce fairly settled in our new habitation, and all the important\r\naffairs attending the necessary alterations of carpets, curtains,\r\netc., being nearly finished, we began to wonder what we were to do\r\nwith \"Our Farm of Four Acres.\" That we must keep a cow was\r\nacknowledged by both; and the first step to be taken was to buy one.\r\nThe small town in which our house was situated boasted of a market\r\nweekly, and there we resolved to make the important purchase.\r\nAccordingly, we sent our man-of-all-work to inspect those offered for\r\nsale. Shortly he returned, accompanied by a small black cow, with a\r\ncalf a week old. We purchase these animals for $50; and it was very\r\namusing to see all the half-dozen children running into the\r\nstable-yards, with their little cups to enjoy the first-fruits of\r\ntheir country life. But what proved far more of a treat than the new\r\nmilk was the trouble of procuring it, for the cow proved a very\r\nspiteful one, and knocked the unfortunate milker, with his pail,\r\n\"heels-over-head.\" AS he was not in the least hurt, the juveniles were\r\nallowed to laugh as long as they pleased; but H. and myself looked\r\nrather grave at the idea having the milk knocked down as soon as there\r\nwas about a quart in the pail. We were, therefore, greatly reassured\r\nwhen told that \"Madam Sukey\" would be quiet and tractable as soon as\r\nher calf was taken away. \"Then why not take it at one?\" said I; but\r\nwas informed that we must not deprive her of it for a week. However, I\r\nam bound to confess that our first week's farming turned out badly,\r\nfor the cow would not be milked, quietly, and every morning we were\r\ninformed that two men were obliged to be called in to hold her while\r\nshe was milked. At the end of the week we sold the calf for five\r\ndollars, and after a month the cow became on quite friendly terms with\r\nher milker, and has proved ever since very profitable to our small\r\ndiary.\r\n\r\nWe did not contemplate making butter with one cow, as we thought so\r\nlarge a household would consume all the milk. Very soon, however,\r\n\"nurse\" complained that \"the milk was 'too rich' for the children; it\r\nwas not in the least like London milk; it must either be watered or\r\nskimmed for the little ones: but she would rather have it skimmed.\"\r\nThat was done, and for a whole fortnight H. and myself used nothing\r\nbut cream in our tea and coffee. At first this was a great luxury, and\r\nwe said continually to each other, how delightful it was to have such\r\na dainty in profusion. Soon, like the children, we began to discover\r\nit was \"too good for us,\" and found that we liked plenty of new milk\r\nmuch better for general use; besides, consume as much as we would, we\r\nhad still more than was wanted: so we invested fifteen dollars in a\r\nchurn and other requisites, and thought with great satisfaction of the\r\nsaving we should effect in our expenses by making our own butter. But\r\nnow arose a difficulty which had not previously occurred to us: Who\r\nwas to make it? Our domestic servants both declared that they could\r\nnot do so; and the elder one, who had been many years in the family,\r\nwas born and bred in London, and detested the country and everything\r\nconnected with it, gave her opinion in the most decided manner, that\r\nthere was quite enough \"muck\" in the house already, without making\r\nmore work with butter-making, which she said confidently, would only\r\nbe fit for the pig when it was made. Here was a pretty state of\r\nthings! What were we to do? must we give up all hope of eating our own\r\nbutter, and regard the money as lost which we had just expended for\r\nthe churn, etc.? After a few minutes' bewilderment, the idea occurred\r\nto both of us at the same moment: \"Cannot we make the butter, and be\r\nindependent of these household rebels?\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said I, dolefully, \"we don't in the least know how to set about\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of that?\" replied H.: \"where was the use of expending so much\r\nmoney in books relative to a country life as you did before we left\r\ntown, if they are not to enlighten our ignorance on country matters?\r\nBut one thing is certain, we cannot make butter till we have learnt\r\n_how_; so let us endeavor to obtain the requisite knowledge to do so\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\nWe accordingly devoted the remainder of the day to consulting the\r\nvarious books on domestic and rural economy we had collected together\r\nprevious to leaving London. Greatly puzzled we were by them. On\r\nreferring to the subject ob butter-making, one authority said, \"you\r\nmust never was the butter, but only knock it on a board, in order to\r\nget the buttermilk from it.\" Another only told us to \"well cleanse the\r\nbuttermilk from it,\" without giving us an idea how the process was to\r\nbe accomplished; while the far-famed Mrs. Rundle, in an article headed\r\n\"Dairy,\" tells the dairy-maid to \"keep a book in which to enter the\r\namount of butter she makes,\" and gives butt little idea how the said\r\nbutter is to be procured. Another authority said, \"after the butter is\r\ncome, cut it in pieces to take out cow-hairs;\" this appeared to us the\r\noddest direction of all, for surely it was possible to remove them\r\nfrom the cream before it was put into the churn. We were very much\r\ndissatisfied with the amount of practical knowledge we gleaned from\r\nour books; they seemed to us written for the benefit of those who\r\nalready were well acquainted with the management of a dairy, and\r\nconsequently of very little service to those who wished to acquire the\r\nrudiments of the art of butter-making.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we proceeded to make a trial, and the first thing we\r\ndid was to strain the cream through a loose fine cloth into the churn,\r\nthen taking the handle we began to turn it vigorously;* [Ninety times\r\nin a minute is the proper speed with which the handle should be\r\nturned.] the weather was hot, and after churning for more than an\r\nhour, there seemed as little prospect of butter as when we commenced.\r\nWe stared at each other in blank amazement. Must we give it up? No;\r\nthat was not to be thought of. H. suddenly remembered, that somewhere\r\nshe had heard that in warm weather you should put the churn in cold\r\nwater. As ours was a box one, we did not see how we could manage this;\r\nbut the bright idea entered her head, that if we could not put the\r\nwater outside the churn we might _in_: so we pumped a quart of\r\nspring-water into it and churned away with fresh hopes: nor were we\r\ndisappointed; in about a quarter of an hour we heard quite a different\r\nsound as we turned the handle, which assured us that the cream had\r\nundergone a change, and taking off the lid--(how many times had we\r\ntaken it off before!)--we saw what at that moment appeared the most\r\nwelcome sight in the world--some lumps of rich yellow butter. It was\r\nbut a small quantity, but there it was: the difficulty was overcome so\r\nfar. But now there arose the question of what we were to do with it in\r\norder to clean if from the butter milk, for all our authorities\r\ninsisted on the necessity of this being done, though they did not\r\nagree in the mode of doing it. One said, that \"if it was washed, it\r\nwould not keep good, because water soon became putrid, and so would\r\nthe butter.\" We were told by another book, \"that if it was _not_\r\nwashed it would be of two colors, and dreadfully rank.\" We thought\r\nthat it would be easier not to wash it, and it was bad enough to\r\njustify the term \"muck,\" which was applied to it by the kitchen\r\noracles, who rejoiced exceedingly in our discomfiture. We left the\r\ndairy half inclined to abjure butter-making for the future. In a day\r\nor two we began to reflect, that as we had a \"Farm of Four Acres,\" we\r\nmust mange to do something with it, and what so profitable to a large\r\nfamily as making butter? So, when we had collected sufficient cream,\r\nwe tried again, and this time with great success. We commenced as\r\nbefore, by straining the cream, and then taking the handle of the\r\nchurn we turned it more equally than we had done before; in half an\r\nour we heard the welcome sound which proclaimed that the \"butter was\r\ncome.\" This time we washed it well; it was placed in a pan under the\r\npump, and the water suffered to run on it till not the least milkiness\r\nappeared in it; we then removed it to a board that had been soaking\r\nfor some time in cold water, salted it to our taste, and afterwards,\r\nwith two flat boards, such as butter-men use in London shops, made it\r\nup into rolls. It was as good as it could be, and we were delighted to\r\nthink that we had conquered all the difficulties attending its\r\nmanufacture: but we had yet to discover the truth of the proverb, that\r\n\"one swallow does not make a summer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nOUR SECOND COW.\r\n\r\nWe soon found that we could not expect to supply our family with\r\nbutter from one cow, and we thought that, as we had to perform the\r\nduties of dairy-women, we might as well have the full benefit of our\r\nlabor. We, therefore, purchased another cow; but before doing so, were\r\nadvised not this time to have Welsh one, but to give more money and\r\nhave a larger animal. This we did, and bought a very handsome\r\nstrawberry-colored one, for which, with the calf, we gave $75; and\r\nhere it will be as well to say that we think it was $25 thrown away,\r\nfor in respect did she prove more valuable than the black one, for\r\nwhich we had given but $50. For a small dairy, we think the black\r\nWelsh cow answers as well, or better, than any other. The price is\r\nvery small, and, judging from our own, they are very profitable. They\r\nare also much hardier than those of a larger breed, and may be kept\r\nout all winter, excepting when snow is on the ground.\r\n\r\nAfter our new cow had been in our possession just a week, we received\r\none morning the unwelcome intelligence that the \"new cow\" was very\r\nbad. We went into the meadow, and saw the poor creature looking\r\ncertainly as we had been told, \"very bad.\" We asked our factotum what\r\nwas the matter with her. To this he replied, that he did not know, but\r\nthat he had sent for a man who was \"very clever in cows.\"\r\n\r\nIn a short time this clever man arrived, bringing with him a friend,\r\nlikewise learned in cattle. He went to see the patient, and returned\r\nto us looking very profound.\r\n\r\n\"A bad job!\" said he, with a shake of the head worthy of Sheridan's\r\nLord Burleigh. \"A sad job, indeed! and you only bought her last\r\nmarket-day. Well, it can't be helped.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what ails her?\" said I.\r\n\r\n\"What ails her! why, she's got the lung disease.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what it is that? said I.\r\n\r\n\"What's that! why, it's what kills lots of cows; takes 'em off in two\r\nor three days. You must sell her for what she'll fetch. Perhaps you\r\nmay get $10 for her. I'll get rid of her for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said H., \"if she has the 'lung disease' you talk of, you tell\r\nus she must die.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; she'll die, sure enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, who will buy a cow that is sure to be dead to-morrow or\r\nnext day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, that's no concern of yours!  _You_ get rid of her, that's all.\"\r\n\r\nTo this dictum we rather demurred, and resolved to send for a\r\ncow-doctor, and see if she could be cured; if not, to take care she\r\nwas not converted after her death into \"country sausages,\" for the\r\nbenefit of London consumers of those dainties. Our friendly counsellor\r\nwas very indignant at our perversity in not getting rid of a cow with\r\n\"the lung disease,\" and stumped out of the yard in a fit of virtuous\r\nindignation. With proper treatment the cow soon got well.\r\n\r\nWe still had occasional trouble with our butter-making; sometimes it\r\nwould come in half an hour, sometimes we were hard at work with the\r\nchurn for two or three hours, and then the butter was invariably bad.\r\nWe tried to procure information on the subject, and asked several\r\nfarmer's wives in the neighborhood \"how long butter ought to be in\r\ncoming.\" We always received the same answer:--\r\n\r\n\"Why, you see, ma'am, that depends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" we asked, \"what does it depend on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, on lots of things.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, tell us some of the things on which it depends.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you see it's longer coming in hot weather, and it's longer\r\ncoming in cold weather; and it depends on how long the cow has calved,\r\nand how you churn, and on lots beside.\"\r\n\r\nWe found we must endeavor to discover for ourselves the reason why we\r\nwere half an hour in getting it one day, and the next, perhaps, two or\r\nthree hours.\r\n\r\nAs the weather became colder we found it more troublesome, and one\r\nfrosty day we churned four hours without success. We put in cold\r\nwater, we put in hot we put in salt, we talked of adding vinegar, but\r\ndid not; we churned as fast as we could turn the handle, and then as\r\nslowly as possible, but still no butter. At the end of more than four\r\nhours our labors were rewarded. The butter came; strong, rank stuff it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nWe determined before the next churning day to try and find out the\r\nreason of all this trouble. We once more took to our books, but were\r\nnone the wiser, for none of them told us anything about the particular\r\nthing we searched for. After many experiments we tried the effect of\r\nbringing the cream into the kitchen over night, and see if warmth\r\nwould make any difference. It was guess-work for two or three\r\nchurnings, but the discovery was made at last, that we were always\r\nsure of our butter in half an hour, provided the cream was, when put\r\ninto the churn, at a temperature of from 50' to 60'.* [We kept a small\r\nthermometer for the purpose of plunging into the cream-pot. If it was\r\nlower than 55' we waited till it reached that degree: if the weather\r\nwas very warm, and it rose higher than we have specified, we did not\r\nattempt to churn till by some means we had lowered it to the proper\r\ntemperature.] No matter how long the cow had calved, how hot or how\r\ncold the weather, if we put the cream into the churn at that degree of\r\nheat the butter was sure to come, in as near as possible the time we\r\nhave specified.\r\n\r\nThis, in the winter, was effected by bringing the cream-pot into the\r\nkitchen over night, and if the weather was very cold, placing it on a\r\nchair a moderate distance from the fire for about a quarter of an hour\r\nin the morning: boiling water was likewise put into the churn for half\r\nan hour before it was used.\r\n\r\nNow, no doubt, a regular dairymaid would \"turn up her nose\" at all\r\nthese details; but I do not write for those who know their business,\r\nbut for the benefit of those ladies who, as is now so much the custom,\r\nreside a few miles from the city or town in which the business or\r\nprofession their husbands may be situated. In many cases they take\r\nwith them town-bred servants to a country residence; and then, like\r\nourselves, find they know nothing whatever of the duties required of\r\nthem. To those who have several acres of pasture land, of course this\r\nlittle book is all \"bosh.\" They employ servants who know their work\r\nand perform it properly; but most \"suburbans\" require the cook to\r\nundertake the duties of the dairy, and unless they are regular country\r\nservants they neither do their work well nor willingly. If any lady\r\nwho has one or two cows will instruct her servant to follow our\r\ndirections, she will always be sure of good butter, with very little\r\ntrouble. All that is required is a churn, milk-pans (at the rate of\r\nthree to each cow), a milk-pail, a board (or, better still, a piece of\r\nmarble), to make the butter up on, a couple of butter-boards, such as\r\nare used in the shops to roll it into form, and a crock for the cream.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter we will give, as concisely as we can, the whole\r\nprocess that we ourselves used in our dairy.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE BUTTER.\r\n\r\nLet the cream be at the temperature of 55' to 60'; if the weather is\r\ncold, put boiling water into the churn for half an hour before you\r\nwant to use it: when that is poured off, strain in the cream through a\r\nbutter-cloth. When the butter is coming, which is easily ascertained\r\nby the sound, take off the lid, and with one of the flat boards scrape\r\ndown the sides of the churn; and do the same to the lid: this prevents\r\nwaste. When the butter is come, the buttermilk is to be poured off and\r\nspring-water put in the churn, and turned for two or three minutes:\r\nthis is to be then poured away, and fresh added, and again the handle\r\nturned for a minute or two. Should there be the least appearance of\r\nmilkiness when this is poured from the churn, more is to be put. This\r\nwe found was a much better mode of extracting all the buttermilk than\r\nplacing it in a pan under the pump, as we did when we commenced our\r\nlabors. The butter is then to be placed on the board or marble, and\r\nsalted to taste; then, with a cream-cloth, wrung out of spring-water,\r\npress all the moisture from it. When it appears quite dry and firm,\r\nmake it up into rolls with the flat boards. The whole process should\r\nbe completed in three-quarters of an hour.\r\n\r\nWe always used a large tub which was made for the purpose, and every\r\narticle we were going to use was soaked in it for half an hour in\r\nboiling water; then that removed, and cold spring-water substituted;\r\nand the things we required remained in it till they were wanted. This\r\nprevents the butter form adhering to the boards, cloth, &c., which\r\nwould render the task of \"making it up\" both difficult and\r\ndisagreeable.\r\n\r\nIn hot weather, instead of bringing the cream-crock into the kitchen\r\nit must be kept as cool as possible; for as it is essential in the\r\nwinter to raise the temperature of the cream to the degree I have\r\nstated, so in the summer it must be lowered to it. Should your dairy\r\nnot be cool enough for the purpose, it is best effected by keeping the\r\ncream-pot in water as cold as you can procure it, and by making the\r\nbutter early in the morning, and placing cold water in the churn some\r\ntime before it is used. By following these directions you will have\r\ngood butter throughout the year.\r\n\r\nThe cows should be milked as near the diary as possible, as it\r\nprevents the cream from rising well if the milk is carried any\r\ndistance.* [In very cold weather the milk-pans must be placed by the\r\nfire some time before the milk is strained into them, or the cream\r\nwill not rise.] It should be at once strained into the milk-pans, and\r\nnot disturbed for forty-eight hours in winter, and twenty-four in\r\nsummer. In hot weather it is highly important that the cream should be\r\nperfectly strained from the milk, or it will make it very rank. Half a\r\ndozen moderate-sized lumps of sugar to every two quarts of cream tend\r\nto keep it sweet. In summer always churn twice a week. Some persons\r\nimagine that cream cannot be \"too sweet,\" but that is a mistake; it\r\nmust have a certain degree of acidity, or it will not produce butter,\r\nand if put into the churn without it, must be beaten with the paddles\r\ntill it acquires it. The cream should, in the summer, be shifted each\r\nmorning into a clean crock, that has first been well scalded and then\r\nsoaked in cold water; and the same rule applies to all the utensils\r\nused in a dairy. The best things to scrub the churn and all wooden\r\narticles with, are wood ashes and plenty of soap.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the country, the butter made by the farmers' wives\r\nfor sale is not washed at all; they say, \"It washes all the taste\r\naway.\" They remove it from the churn, and then taking it in their\r\nhands, dash it repeatedly on the board; that is what they call\r\n\"smiting\" it. The butter so made is always strong, and of two colors,\r\nas a portion of the buttermilk remains in it: if any of it were put\r\ninto a cup, and that placed in hot water, for the purpose clarifying,\r\nthere would, when it was melted, be found a large deposit of\r\nbuttermilk at the bottom of the cup. We have tried the butter made our\r\nway, and there was scarcely any residuum.\r\n\r\nBesides, this \"smiting\" is a most disgusting process to witness.  In\r\nwarm weather the butter adheres to the hands of the \"smiter,\" who\r\npuffs and blows over it as if it were very hard work. Indeed, I once\r\nheard a strong-looking girl; daughter of a small farmer in Kent, say\r\nshe was never well, for \"smiting\" the butter was such dreadful hard\r\nwork it gave her a pain in her side. After this \"smiting\" is over, it\r\nis put on a butter-print, and pressed with the hands till it is\r\nconsidered to have received the impression. It is then, through a\r\nsmall hole in the handle, blown off the print with the _mouth_.\r\n\r\nI don't think I shall ever again eat butter which appears at table\r\nwith the figures of cows, flowers, &c., stamped on it. I should always\r\nthink of the process it has gone through for the sake of looking\r\npretty. Nearly all the fresh butter which is sold in London is made up\r\nin large rolls, and, like that we make ourselves, need not be touched\r\nby the fingers of the maker.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nWHAT WE MADE BY OUR COWS.\r\n\r\nEvery week we kept an account of the milk and butter we consumed, and\r\nentered it in our housekeeping-book at the price we should have paid\r\nfor it, supposing we had purchased the articles. We did not put down\r\nLondon prices, but country ones: thus, we charged ourselves with milk\r\nat 6 cents the quart, and butter 27 cents the pound; at the end of six\r\nmonths we made up our accounts, and found we should have paid for milk\r\nfrom the 14th to the 24th of January, $44, and $66 for butter. The\r\nfood for the cows during this period cost us but $4 50, which we paid\r\nfor oil-cake, of which, when the weather became cold, they had two\r\npounds each daily. We do not reckon the value of the hay they consumed\r\nduring winter, because we included the land in our rent. We mowed\r\nthree acres, which produced rather more than six loads of hay.* [We\r\nalways had good crops, as the land had been always well kept. It was\r\nnot \"upland\" hay, but our man said it had good \"heart\" in it for the\r\ncows.] Getting in the crop and thatching it cost, as nearly as\r\npossible, $15, and this quantity was quite sufficient to supply the\r\ntwo cows--with the calf of the Strawberry, which we reared--and the\r\npony.\r\n\r\nAn acre of grass is usually considered sufficient to support a cow\r\nduring the year. If that had to be rented apart from the house, the\r\naverage price would be about $25. Supposing we place that value on our\r\nland, the accounts for six months would stand thus:\r\n\r\n    EXPENSES.\r\n    Land at $25 the acre, for half a year, . . . . . . . . .  $25 00\r\n    Oil-cake,  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    4 50\r\n    Half the expense of getting the hay, . . . . . . . . . .    7 50\r\n                                                              $37 00\r\n  PRODUCE.\r\n  Value of milk and butter,  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . $116 50\r\n  Leaving a balance in our favor, at the end of six months of $79 50.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the winter, a cow-keeper in the neighborhood\r\ntold our man that we should give our cows a little mangel-wurzel. We\r\ninquired, Why? and were told that we should \"keep our cows better\r\ntogether;\" so we paid a guinea for a ton of that vegetable. The first\r\ntime we made butter after they had been fed with it, we found it had a\r\nvery strong, bitter taste. Still, we did not condemn the\r\nmangel-wurzel, but tried it another week. The butter was again bad, so\r\nwe abandoned the roots, and resolved to give the animals nothing but\r\nhay.\r\n\r\nWhen they were quite deprived of green food the milk began to\r\ndecrease; and as we had heard that oil-cake was given to cattle, we\r\nthought we would try some. We did so, and with complete success; we\r\nhad plenty of milk, and the butter was as good as in the middle of\r\nsummer, and nearly as fine a color. We did not make so much as when\r\nthe cows had plenty of grass,--besides, it was now several months\r\nsince the black cow had calved,--but we had sufficient for the\r\nconsumption of the family. The children, it is true, did not have so\r\nmany tarts as when the fruit and butter were more plentiful.\r\n\r\nWe hope that we have made all our statements clearly, and that the\r\nreader will have no difficulty in following us through this narrative\r\nof \"buttermaking.\"\r\n\r\nOf one thing we are quite sure, that it is false economy to feed cows\r\nduring the winter on anything but what we have mentioned. Grains from\r\nthe brewer and distiller are extensively used by cow-keepers in large\r\ntowns, but they cannot be procured in the country; and we have been\r\ntold that cows fed with grains, though they may yield plenty of milk,\r\nwill not make much butter.\r\n\r\nOne winter, when hay was scarce, we found that they did very well with\r\ncarrots occasionally, and that they did not impart any unpleasant\r\ntaste to the butter. They are likewise found of potatoes unboiled; but\r\nthese things are only required when you keep more stock than your land\r\ncan support,--a fault very common to inexperienced farmers on a small\r\nscale.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nOUR PIGS.\r\n\r\nWe had every reason to be satisfied with the profit we had derived\r\nfrom our dairy, and next proceeded to examine the accounts we had kept\r\nof our pigs for six months.\r\n\r\nWe commenced by purchasing, on the 14th of July, one for which we paid\r\n$7 50. For the first month it had nothing but the wash from the house,\r\nthe skim-milk from the dairy, and greens from the garden. When we\r\nbegan to dig the potatoes, we found we could not hope to save the\r\nwhole crop from the disease; we had, therefore, a quantity boiled and\r\nput in the pig-tub, and upon these it was fed another month. At the\r\nend of that time we began to give it a little meal and a few peas. It\r\nwas killed three months after we had purchased it, and the cost for\r\nmeal and peas was just $250. Thus, altogether, we paid for it $10, and\r\nwhen killed it weighed thirteen stone (182 pounds). This we reckoned\r\nworth $1 37½ the stone, which made the value of the meat $17 87½; we\r\nhad, therefore, a clear profit of $7 87½. Of course, it would have\r\nbeen very different had we bought all the food for it; but the\r\nskim-milk, and vegetables from the garden would have been wasted, had\r\nwe been without a pig to consume them: as it was, the profit arose\r\nfrom our \"farm of four acres.\"\r\n\r\nThese particulars are given for the reason that the writer has\r\nfrequently heard her friends in the country say, \"Oh, I never keep\r\neither pigs or poultry: the pork and the fowls always cost twice the\r\nprice they can be purchased for.\" This we could never understand, when\r\nthe despisers of home-cured hams and home-fed poultry used to assert\r\nit. Supposing there was no actual profit, still it seemed strange that\r\nthose who had the option of eating pork fed on milk and vegetables,\r\nand fowls which were running about the meadows a few hours before they\r\nwere killed, should prefer those which are kept in close confinement\r\nand crammed with candle-graves and other abominations, till they are\r\nconsidered what dealers call \"ripe\" enough to kill; and as for pork,\r\nmuch of that which is sold in towns is fed on the offal from the\r\nbutchers' shops, and other filth. It is well known that pigs will eat\r\nanything in the shape of animal food; and for myself, I would much\r\nrather, like the Jew and the Turk, abjure it altogether, than partake\r\nof meat fed as pork too commonly is. How few people can eat this meat\r\nwith impunity! but they might do so if the animal had been properly\r\nfed.\r\n\r\nIt is a great mistake to make pork so fat as it usually is: it is not\r\nonly great waste, but deters many persons from partaking of it.\r\nServants will not eat it, and those who purchase it, as well as those\r\nwho kill their own pigs, may be certain that the surplus fat finds its\r\nway into the \"wash-tub,\" for the benefit of a future generation of\r\n\"piggies.\"\r\n\r\nOur next venture proved equally fortunate.  We bought three small\r\npigs, for which we gave $3 each; and as we wished to have pickled pork\r\nand small hams, they were killed off as we required them. The first\r\ncost $2 for barley-meal and peas, and weighed six stone, which, at $1\r\n37½ a stone, was worth $8 25. As the cost of the pig and the food came\r\nto just $5, we had a profit of $3 25; but we considered we had no\r\nright to complain: the meat was delicious, and partaken of by the\r\nchildren as freely as if it had been mutton.\r\n\r\nWe kept the other pigs somewhat longer, and they cost us no more for\r\nfood; for, as I have already stated, they were entirely kept with the\r\nproduce of our \"four-acre farm,\" till about three weeks before they\r\nwere killed. About a bushel and a half of barley meal and a peck of\r\npeas was all that was purchased for them.\r\n\r\nThe best way to ensure the healthy condition of the animals is to let\r\nthem have the range of a small meadow; they should likewise be\r\noccasionally well scrubbed with soap and water. If they are thus\r\ntreated, how much more wholesome must the meat be than when the poor\r\ncreatures are shut up in dirty styes, and suffered to eat any garbage\r\nwhich is thrown to them! We always had all their food boiled. At first\r\nthere was a great deal of opposition to the \"muck\" being introduced\r\ninto the scullery; but in a little time that was overcome, and a\r\n\"batch\" of potatoes used to be boiled in the copper about once a\r\nmonth. When the skim-milk was removed from the dairy, it was taken to\r\nthe \"trough,\" and some of it mixed with a portion of the boiled\r\npotatoes, and with this food they were fed three times daily.\r\n\r\nWe have been told by a practical farmer on a larger scale, that when\r\npotatoes are not to be procured, a pig of thirty-five stone may be\r\nfattened in ten days on something less than two hundred weight of\r\ncarrots. We intend to try if this is the case, and have half an acre\r\nof our orchard (which is arable) sown with carrot-seed, and feed our\r\n\"stock\" in the winter with the produce. With the surplus milk of two\r\ncows we find we can always keep three pigs with very little expense.\r\nOf course, if we did not plant plenty of potatoes, we must purchase\r\nmore meal for them; but as we have an acre of kitchen-garden, we can\r\nvery well spare half of it to grow roots for the cows and pigs. We do\r\nnot reckon labor in our expenses, as we must have had a gardener, even\r\nif we had not so much spare ground, for our flower-garden and\r\ngreenhouse require daily work.\r\n\r\nWe hope we have convinced those who may think of having a \"little\r\nplace\" a few miles from town, that it may be made a source of profit\r\nas well as of amusement, and that any trouble which may be experienced\r\nby the lady superintending her own dairy and farm will be repaid by\r\nhaving her table well supplied with good butter, plenty of fresh eggs,\r\n(of the poultry-yard we shall speak presently,) well-cured hams,\r\nbacon, delicate and fresh pork, well-fed ducks, and chickens. All\r\nthose country dainties are easily to be procured on a \"farm of four\r\nacres.\"\r\n\r\nNor must another item be omitted--health; for if you wish to be\r\nfortunate in your farming, you must look after things yourself, and\r\nthat will necessitate constant exercise in the open air. We think that\r\nwe have given full particulars for the management of the cow and pig.\r\n\r\nIn the next chapter we will relate our experience of the poultry-yard.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nOUR POULTRY.\r\n\r\nWe commenced stocking our poultry-yard in July, by purchasing\r\ntwenty-eight chickens and twenty ducks, for which we paid $16 58 in\r\nthe market. Some of them were too young for the table at the time we\r\npurchased them, but were all consumed at the end of four months, with\r\nthe exception of seven hens and a cock, which we saved for \"stock.\"\r\nThus in the time I have mentioned we killed ten couple of ducks, and\r\nthe same of fowls. These we entered in our housekeeping expenses at $1\r\n37 a couple, though they were larger and better than could have been\r\npurchased in a London shop for $1 75.\r\n\r\nWe must now proceed to reckon what they cost for food, and then see if\r\nany balance remained in our favor. They consumed during the time they\r\nwere getting in order for the table, three bushels of barley, at $1 25\r\nthe bushel, one bushel of meal at the same price, and one hundred\r\nweight of what is called \"chicken rice,\" at $3 00.\r\n\r\n  The cost of the barley and meal was, . . . .  $5 00\r\n  Rice,  . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .   3 00\r\n  Cost of poultry, . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  16 58\r\n\r\n  Making the total price,                      $24 58\r\n    Ten couple of ducks, and the same number\r\n    of chickens, would amount to,              $27 50\r\n\r\nThus, at the first sight, it would appear that we gained but $2 92 by\r\nfour months' trouble in attending to our fowl-yard; but we have now to\r\ntake from the purchase money the value of the eight we saved for\r\nstock, and likewise to deduct from the barley and rice the quantity\r\nconsumed by them in the four months. Now these eight were large fowls\r\nwhen bought, and well worth 50 cents each. We must allow for their\r\nfood at least a fourth part of that consumed. We have then to take off\r\n$4 00 from the first cost of the poultry, and $2 00 from the value of\r\nthe food, which will add $6 00 to the $2 92, leaving on the whole\r\ntransaction a profit of $8 92.\r\n\r\nWe have still another small item to add.  One of the hens we saved\r\nbegan to lay in the middle of September, and by the time the four\r\nmonths were expired had given us two dozen eggs, which at that time of\r\nyear, even in the country, were not to be procured under 37½ cents the\r\ndozen; so that we have to add 75 cents to $8 92, making a clear profit\r\nin four months of $9 67.\r\n\r\nIt was a source of great amusement to ourselves, as well as to the\r\nchildren, by whom it was always considered a treat to run in the\r\nmeadows, with barley in their little baskets, to the \"coobiddies.\"\r\nWhen we first had the poultry we kept them in the stable-yard; but we\r\nsoon found they did not thrive: they had been taken from a farm where\r\nthey had the free range of the fields, and drooped in confinement, and\r\nfrom want of the grass and worms which they had been accustomed to\r\nfeed on. We had a house constructed for them in the meadow nearest the\r\nhouse, and soon found that they throve much better, and did not\r\nrequire so much food. We had no trouble with them, except in seeing\r\nthat the house was cleaned out daily. Through the fields flowed a\r\nstream of clean water, consequently our ducks throve well. The bushel\r\nof meal which figures in our accounts was for them; they used to have\r\na little mixed in hot water once a day. We soon left it off, for we\r\nfound the rice boiled in skim-milk was equally good for them, and much\r\ncheaper.\r\n\r\nPoultry of all kinds are very fond of \"scraps;\" the children were\r\nalways told to cut up pieces of potatoes, greens, or meat, which they\r\nmight leave on their plates at the nursery dinner; and when they were\r\nremoved to the kitchen, they were collected together and put into the\r\nrice-bowl for the chickens. We always fed them three times daily: in\r\nthe morning with rice, in the middle of the day with \"scraps,\" and in\r\nthe evening they had just as much barley thrown to them as they cared\r\nto pick up eagerly.\r\n\r\nWe have heard some persons complain of the great expense attending a\r\npoultry-yard, but this arises from the person who has the charge of\r\nthem throwing down just as much again grain as the fowls can consume.\r\nWe have ourselves often seen barley trodden into the ground, if\r\noccasionally we left the task of feeding to the lad.\r\n\r\nIt must, of course, be impossible at all times for a lady to go into\r\nthe fields for the purpose of feeding her chickens; the only plan to\r\nprevent waste is to have a meal-room in the house, and as much given\r\nout daily as is considered necessary for the consumption of the\r\npoultry. This is some little trouble, but will be well repaid by\r\nhaving at all times cheap and wholesome fowls, etc.\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto only spoken of the profit which may be obtained from\r\na fowl-yard, when the stock is purchased. The farmer's wife, from whom\r\nwe bought _ours_, of course gained some money by their sale. When we\r\nreared our own chickens from our own eggs, we received much more\r\nemolument from our yard; but in this little volume it is my purpose to\r\nshow how a person should _commence_, who leaves London or any other\r\nlarge town for a suburban residence.\r\n\r\nIt must always be borne in mind, that nothing will prosper if left\r\nwholly to servants; the country proverb of \"the master's eye fattens\r\nthe steed,\" is a very true one, and another is quite as good: \"the\r\nbest manure you can put on the ground is the foot of the master.\" As a\r\nproof of our assertion we will, in the next chapter, detail the\r\ndisasters we experienced when we left the charge of rabbits to the\r\nsuperintendence of a servant.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nOUR LOSSES.\r\n\r\nOur young people were very anxious to add some rabbits to their\r\nplaythings, and as we always like to encourage a love of animals in\r\nchildren, we consented that they should become the fortunate\r\nshare-holders in a doe and six young ones. These were bought early in\r\nSeptember, and, as long as the weather would allow, the children used\r\nto take them food; by and by, however, one died, and then came the\r\ncomplaint that Master Harry had killed it by giving it too much green\r\nmeat. The young gentleman was thereupon commanded not to meddle with\r\nthem for the future, but the rabbits did not derive any benefit from\r\nhis obedience; two or three times weekly we heard of deaths taking\r\nplace in the hutch, till at last the whole half-dozen, with their\r\nmamma, reposed under the large walnut-tree.\r\n\r\nOne day the lad who had attended to them knocked at the drawing-room\r\ndoor, and on entering with a large basket, drew from it a most\r\nbeautiful black-and-white doe, and held it up before our admiring\r\neyes; this was followed by the display of seven young ones, as pretty\r\nas the mother.\r\n\r\n\"Please, ma'am,\" said Tom, \"these are the kind of rabbits you ought to\r\nhave bought. My brother keeps rabbits, and these are some of his; I'll\r\nwarrant they won't die!\"\r\n\r\nWilling once more to gratify the children, as well as to solve the\r\nenigma of whether it must be inevitable to lose by keeping these\r\nanimal, we became the possessors of these superior creatures, with the\r\nunderstanding that no one was to have anything to do with them but\r\nTom, the said Tom saying, with perfect confidence, that \"he would\r\n'warrant' they should weigh five pounds each in six weeks.\"\r\n\r\nNot being learned in rabbits, we trusted to his experience and\r\npromises that we should always from that have a brace for the table\r\nwhenever we wished for them. What was our disappointment, then, when a\r\nweek after we heard of the death of one of them! This was soon\r\nfollowed by another, and another, till the whole seven little\r\n\"bunnies\" shared the grave under the walnut-tree, and in a day or two\r\nthe doe likewise departed: I concluded she died of grief for the loss\r\nof her offspring.\r\n\r\nIn vain did we endeavor to discover the reason of this mortality; it\r\ncould not have been for want of food, for they consumed nearly as many\r\noats as the pony. At last Tom thought of the hutch, or \"locker,\" as he\r\ncalled it. \"It must,\" said he, gravely, \"have had _the_ disease.\" So\r\nwhat that fatal complaint among rabbits is, remains a profound mystery\r\nto us.\r\n\r\nNow this hutch was made of new wood, in a carpenter's shop, at a cost\r\nof nearly $10, and how it could have become infected with this fearful\r\ncomplaint we could not comprehend. However, from that time we\r\nabandoned rabbit-keeping, and resolved not, for the future, to keep\r\nany live stock which we could not look after ourselves. We did not\r\nattempt to do so in this case, because we were frightened at the\r\nresponsibility Tom threw on our shoulders, if we looked at them the\r\ndoe always eating her young ones was one of the evils to be dreaded by\r\nour interference.\r\n\r\nI suppose profit is to be made by keeping them, or tame rabbits would\r\nnot be placed in the poulterers' shops by the side of ducks and\r\nchickens, but we are quite at a loss to know how it is accomplished.\r\nIt did not much matter in a pecuniary point of view, as it was very\r\ndoubtful if the children's pets would ever have died for the benefit\r\nof the dinner-table, and I only insert this chapter for the purpose of\r\nproving what I stated, viz.; that if a lady wishes her stock of any\r\nkind to prosper, she must look after it herself. When I say prosper, I\r\nmean without the expense being double the value of the produce she\r\nwould receive from her \"four-acre farm.\"\r\n\r\nWe did not enter these disasters in our housekeeping book, it went\r\nunder the title of children's expenses. For my own part, I am disposed\r\nto think that it must always be expensive to keep live stock of any\r\nkind for which all the food has to be purchased. Had we continued to\r\nkeep our fowls in the yard, I am convinced they would have brought us\r\nlittle or no profit; but the grass, worms, and other things they found\r\nfor themselves in the field, half supplied them in food, as well as\r\nkeeping them healthy. We had not one death among our poultry from\r\ndisease in the six months of which I have been relating this\r\nexperience of our farming.\r\n\r\nOur next venture proved more prosperous than the rabbits, and will be\r\nrelated in the following chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nOUR PIGEONS.\r\n\r\nAfter we had been a few months in the country, a friend, who was a\r\ngreat pigeon-fancier, wished to add some new varieties to his cote,\r\nand offered to send us, as a present, seven or eight pairs of those he\r\nwished to part with. We were greatly pleased with his offer, and at\r\nonce set the carpenter at work to prepare a house for them. As soon as\r\nit was ready we received sixteen beautiful pigeons.\r\n\r\nFor the first fortnight the pigeon-holes were covered with net, that\r\nthe birds might be enabled to survey at a distance their new abode,\r\nand become accustomed to the sight of the persons about the yard. When\r\nthe net was removed, they eagerly availed themselves of their freedom\r\nto take flights round and round the house. One couple, of less\r\ncontented disposition than the others, never came back, nor did we\r\never hear that they had returned to their old home. Our number was\r\nnot, however, lessened by their desertion, for we received, at nearly\r\nthe same time, from another friend, a pair of beautiful \"pouters.\"\r\n\r\nAs we resolved to keep a debtor-and-creditor account of all the things\r\nwe kept, we found that our eighteen pigeons consumed in every seven\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\n  Two pecks of peas . . . . . . . . . . . $0 75\r\n  One peck of tares . . . . . . . . . . .    37\r\n  Ditto maize . . . . . . . . . . . . . .    33\r\n                                          $1 45\r\n\r\nIn the first fourteen weeks we kept them, we received but two pairs of\r\nyoung ones, which were most mercilessly slaughtered for a pie. The\r\nprice of these in the market would have been 37 cents per pair, so\r\nthat we were losers on our stock; but we must say that we did not\r\nreceive them till nearly the end of September, and we were agreeably\r\nsurprised at finding we had young ones fit the table at Christmas.\r\n\r\nFrom that time we have been well recompensed for our peas, tares, and\r\nmaize, as each couple produces on an average a pair every six weeks;\r\nthus the produce was worth $3 00, while the cost was something less\r\nthan $1 50. Even had there been no profit derived, we should still\r\nhave kept them, as we consider no place in the country complete\r\nwithout these beautiful and graceful little creatures. It was a\r\nsubject of never-failing delight to the children, watching them as\r\nthey wheeled round and round the house of an evening, and it was\r\nalways considered a great privilege to be allowed to feed them.\r\n\r\nAt first the food was kept in the stable, and Tom was the feeder; but\r\nwe were soon obliged to alter this, as we never went into the yard\r\nwithout treading on the corn. It was afterwards removed to the back\r\nkitchen, round the door of which they used to assemble in a flock,\r\ntill one of the servants threw them out their allowance. They were\r\nconsidered \"pets,\" by all the household, and were so tame that they\r\nwould allow themselves to be taken in the hand and stroked.\r\n\r\nAs for the young ones, who were doomed to the _steak_, we never saw\r\nthem till they made their appearance in the pie. They were taken from\r\nthe nest as soon as they were fledged.\r\n\r\nI mention this, because we were sometimes accused by our visitors (for\r\nwhose especial benefit the young ones were sometimes slain) of\r\ncruelty, in eating the \"pretty creatures;\" but we never found that\r\nthey had any scruples in partaking of them at dinner. It was usually\r\nas they were watching of a summer evening the flight of the parent\r\nbirds that we were taxed with our barbarity.\r\n\r\nWe were one day much amused by a clergyman of our acquaintance, who\r\nkept a great number of these birds in a room, and who, in default of\r\nchildren to pet, made pets of his pigeons. At dinner, a pigeon-pie\r\nmade part of the repast. This was placed opposite a visitor, who was\r\nrequested to carve the dainty. He did so, and sent a portion of it to\r\nhis host. The reverend gentleman looked at the plateful sent him\r\nattentively, and then said with a sigh, \"I will trouble you to\r\nexchange this for part of the other bird. _This_ was a peculiar\r\nfavorite, and I always fed it myself. I put a mark on the breast after\r\nit was picked, for I could not bear to eat the little darling!\"\r\n\r\nWe always thought that this sentimental divine had better either not\r\nhave had the \"little darling\" put into the pie, or have swallowed his\r\nfeelings and his favorite at the same time.\r\n\r\nThis dish seems to occasion wit as well as sentiment, for we were once\r\nasked by a facetious friend, \"Why is a pigeon in a pie like\r\nShakspeare's Richard III?\" We \"gave it up,\" and were told, \"Because it\r\nwas bound unto the steak (stake), and could not fly.\" This may perhaps\r\nbe a worn-out jest, but it was fresh to the writer, and so perhaps it\r\nmay be to some of her readers.\r\n\r\nWe will say a few words on the management of pigeons before we\r\nconclude this chapter.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary that a pan of water should be place in their house\r\neach day for them to wash in, and that a large lump of bay-salt should\r\nlikewise be kept there. It should be occasionally cleaned out, and\r\nthis is all the trouble attending keeping them. Feed them three times\r\na day; and never throw more down than they pick up at a meal.\r\n\r\nAs I have said nothing of the profit derived from chickens when they\r\nare _reared_ by the owner, so I now say nothing of the saving in\r\nkeeping pigeons, when we came to sow a large patch of Indian corn, as\r\nwell as some tares. We did so successfully in the acre of ground\r\ncalled the Orchard; and though we had abundance of fine fruit from it,\r\nthe trees were not planted so thickly as to prevent any kind of crop\r\nfrom flourishing. But we repeat, this little book is a manual for the\r\nuse of the beginner; and to such we hope it may prove both useful and\r\nencouraging.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nHOW WE CURED OUR HAMS.\r\n\r\nI have now recounted our experience in keeping cows, pigs, chickens,\r\nducks, rabbits, and pigeons; and with everything but the rabbits we\r\nwere amply satisfied with the return we received for our labor. We had\r\na constant supply of milk, butter, eggs, ducks, chickens, and pork,\r\nnot only fresh, but in the shape of good hams and bacon.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether it is not presumptuous, in the face of Miss\r\nActon, Mrs. Rundle, and so many other authorities, not forgetting the\r\ngreat Alexis Soyer, to give \"our method of curing\" the last-mentioned\r\ndainties; but we think we may as well follow up the history of our\r\npigs, from the sty to the kitchen. I always found that the recipes\r\nusually given for salting pork contained too much saltpetre, which not\r\nonly renders the meat hard, but causes it to be very indigestible. The\r\nfollowing is the manner in which they were cured by ourselves:\r\n\r\n  For each ham of twelve pounds weight:\r\n    Two pounds of common salt.\r\n    Two ounces of saltpetre.\r\n    ¼ pound of bay salt.\r\n    ¼ pound of coarse sugar.\r\n\r\nThe hams to be well rubbed with this mixture, which must be in the\r\nfinest powder. It is always the best plan to get your butcher to rub\r\nthe meat, as a female hand is hardly heavy enough to do it\r\neffectually; they are then placed in a deep pan, and a wine-glass of\r\nvinegar is added. They should be turned each day; and for the first\r\nthree or four should be well rubbed with brine. After that time it\r\nwill be sufficient, with a wooden or iron spoon, to well ladle it over\r\nthe meat. They should remain three weeks in the pickle. When removed\r\nfrom it, they must be well wiped, put in brown-paper bags, and then\r\nsmoked the _wood_ smoke for three weeks.\r\n\r\nWe once had nearly a whole pig spoiled by its being taken to a\r\nbaker's, where it was _dried_, but not smoked. When it came back it\r\nresembled very strong tallow.\r\n\r\nIn villages it is usual to send bacon and hams to be dried in the\r\nchimneys of farm-houses where wood is burnt, in the old-fashioned\r\nmanner, on dogs; but if resident in or near a small town, there is\r\nalways a drying-house to be met with, where we believe sawdust is used\r\nfor fuel. We have had our own dried in this manner, and always found\r\nthem excellent.\r\n\r\nWe used the same pickle for twenty-four pounds' weight of bacon, with\r\nthe exception that we allow two pounds more of common salt, and when\r\nit is turned the second time the same quantity of salt is rubbed into\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSome persons make a pickle of water, salt, sugar, and saltpetre,\r\nboiled together, and when cold put in the hams, etc., without any\r\nrubbing. We have never tried that way for meats that are to be dried,\r\nbut can strongly recommend it for salt beef, pork, or mutton. The\r\nfollowing is the pickle always used in our kitchen:\r\n\r\n  Three gallons of _soft_ water.\r\n  One pound of coarse sugar.\r\n  Two ounces of saltpetre.\r\n  Three pounds of common salt.\r\n\r\nBoil together, and let it be well skimmed; then, when cold, the meat\r\nto be well wiped and put into it. It will be fit to cook in ten days,\r\nbut may be kept without injury for two months, when the pickle should\r\nbe reboiled and well skimmed. The meat should be covered with brine\r\nand the pan have a cover.\r\n\r\nWe have put legs of mutton into this pickle, and can assure the reader\r\nit is an excellent mode of cooking this joint; and as it is one which\r\nfrequently makes its appearance at table where the family is large, it\r\nis sometimes a pleasant method of varying the dish. It is the best way\r\nof any we know of, for curing tongues; it has the great advantage of\r\nbeing always ready for use, and you are not fearful of the\r\ncarelessness of servants, who not unfrequently forget to look to the\r\nsalting-pans.\r\n\r\nWe can recommend a dish not often seen at table, and that is a sirloin\r\nof beef put into this pickle for about a fortnight. It is infinitely\r\nsuperior either to the round or edgebone, and certainly not so\r\nextravagant as the last-named joint.\r\n\r\nA friend has told us that we should procure some juniper-berries to\r\nput into our ham-pickle, but there were none to be purchased in our\r\nneighborhood, and as we were quite ignorant of the flavor they might\r\nimpart, we did not trouble ourselves to get them. I am fond of old\r\nproverbs, and as our hams and bacon were always good, we determined to\r\n\"let well alone.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X1.\r\n\r\nOUR BREAD.\r\n\r\nAny lady who thinks of trying a country residence, should see that it\r\npossess a small brick oven, for \"home-made\" bread ought always to be\r\nconsidered indispensable in the country. We did not discover that our\r\nnew home was without one till after we entered it. We were laughed at\r\nby our landlord when we mentioned our want of this convenience.\r\n\r\n\"Why!\" cried he, \"there is a baker's shop not five minutes walk from\r\nthe house.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" said I, \"how near the baker's shop may be; we mean to\r\nhave all our bread made at home. It will be, we are sure, better to do\r\nso, both on the score of health and economy.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I really,\" said the gentleman, \"cannot afford to build you an\r\noven; it would cost me $100 at the least.\"\r\n\r\nAt this, H., who had resided for a short time in a house where the\r\nbread was made at home, laughed, and said, \"Really, Mr. L., you need\r\nnot fear that we wish to put you to so much expense, and it is perhaps\r\nbut fair that we should meet you half-way in the matter; so if you\r\nwill find labor we will find materials: or reverse it, if you please.\"\r\n\r\nMr. L. remembered that he had in some outhouse a quantity of \"fire\r\nbricks,\" and it was arranged that we should pay for the labor of\r\nconstructing a three-peck oven. This occasioned on our part an outlay\r\nof $10, and this small sum was the source of considerable saving to us\r\nyearly.\r\n\r\nWe were more fortunate with our bread than with our butter-making, for\r\nMary was a capital baker; our bread was always made from the best\r\nflour. We all liked it much better than bakers' bread, and it was much\r\nmore nourishing. Indeed, when I was once in Kent during \"hopping,\" and\r\nsaw that the women who resided in the neighborhood always gave up half\r\na day's work weekly for the purpose of going home to bake, I used to\r\nwonder why they did not purchase their bread from a baker in the\r\nvillage. I was informed by one of them to whom I put the question,\r\n\"Lord, ma'am, we could not work on bakers' bread, we should be\r\nhalf-starved; it's got no _heart_ in it.\"\r\n\r\nTo a small family, perhaps, the saving might not be considered an\r\nobject, but any one who has for a few months been accustomed to eat\r\nhome-made bread, would be sorry to have recourse to the baker's; the\r\nloaves purchased are usually spongy the first day, and dry and harsh\r\nthe second. It is not only that other ingredients than flour, yeast,\r\nand water are mixed in the dough, but it is seldom sufficiently baked;\r\nbread well made at home and baked in a brick oven for a proper time,\r\nis as good at the end of a week as it is the second day.\r\n\r\nI have heard several persons say, \"I should like home-made bread if it\r\nwere baked every day, but I don't like eating stale bread four or five\r\ndays out of the seven.\" If they stayed with us a day or two, they\r\nbecame convinced that bread which had been made three or four days did\r\nnot deserve the epithet of \"stale.\"\r\n\r\nI will now proceed to show the reader how much flour was consumed in\r\nour household, consisting of thirteen persons.\r\n\r\nWe used to bake weekly twenty-eight pounds of flour, of the best\r\nquality; this produced _forty-two_ pounds of bread. I will give in the\r\nmost explicit manner I can directions for making it, which I imagine\r\nany servant will be able to comprehend:\r\n\r\nPlace in a large pan twenty-eight pounds of flour; make a hole with\r\nthe hand in the centre of it like a large basin, into which strain a\r\npint of yeast from the brewer's; this must be tasted, and if too\r\nbitter a little flour sprinkled in it, and then strained directly;\r\nthen pour in two quarts of water, of the temperature of 100', that is,\r\nwhat is called blood-heat, and stir the flour round from the bottom of\r\nthe hole you have formed with the hand, till that part of the flour is\r\nquite thick and well mixed, though all the rest must remain unwetted;\r\nthen sprinkle a little flour over the moist part, and cover with a\r\ncloth: this is called \"sponge,\" and must be left half an hour to rise.\r\n\r\nDuring this time the fire must be lighted in the oven with fagots, and\r\nthe heat well maintained till the bread is ready to enter it. At the\r\nend of the half-hour add four quarts of water, of the same heat as the\r\nprevious two quarts, and well knead the whole mass into a smooth\r\ndough. This is hard work, and requires strength to do it properly.\r\n\r\nIt must be again covered and left for one hour.  In cold weather both\r\nsponge and dough must be placed on the kitchen-hearth, or it will not\r\nrise well.\r\n\r\nBefore the last water is put in, two table-spoonfuls of salt must be\r\nsprinkled over the flour.\r\n\r\nSometimes the flour will absorb another pint of water.\r\n\r\nWhen the dough has risen, it must be made up into loaves as quickly as\r\npossible; if much handled then, the bread will be heavy.\r\n\r\nIt will require an hour and an half to bake it, if made into\r\nfour-pound loaves.\r\n\r\nWhile the dough is rising the oven must be emptied of the fire, the\r\nashes swept from it, and then well wiped with a damp mop kept for the\r\npurpose. To ascertain if it is sufficiently heated, throw a little\r\nflour into it, and if it brown _directly_, it will do.\r\n\r\n\r\nI think I have stated every particular necessary to enable a novice to\r\nmake a \"batch\" of good bread. I will sum up the articles requisite to\r\nproduce forty-two pounds of the best quality:\r\n\r\n  Flour, 28 pounds.\r\n  Water at 100', 12 or 13 pints.\r\n  Two table-spoonfuls of salt.\r\n  Yeast, 1 pint.\r\n      Bake one hour and a half.\r\n\r\nThe quantity made was ten and a half quarterns, or four-pound loaves;\r\nand, as I have said, supplied our family of thirteen persons for the\r\nweek. For the same number, when we were residing in town, the baker\r\nused to leave _thirteen_ quarterns weekly.\r\n\r\nOne day, in the country, when, from the accidental absence of the\r\nbread-maker, we had to be supplied from the baker, we were surprised\r\nto hear that at the nursery-breakfast the children (six) and nurse\r\nconsumed more than a two-pound loaf, and then were complaining of\r\nbeing \"so hungry\" two hours after. I thought of the words of the\r\nKentish hopper, \"that there was no heart in bakers' bread.\"\r\n\r\nThe servant who has the management of the oven should be instructed to\r\ntake care that the wood-ashes are not thrown into the dust-hole with\r\nthe ashes from the grates. They are always valuable in the country;\r\nand, as I have mentioned, the wooden articles used in the dairy should\r\nalways be scrubbed with them. Should the water which is used in the\r\nhouse be hard, and any washing done at home, they should be place in a\r\ncoarse cloth over a tub, and water poured over them several times to\r\nmake lye, which softens the water, and saves soap much more than soda,\r\nand is likewise better for the linen.\r\n\r\nThe brick oven will often prove a source of great convenience,\r\nindependent of bread-making. It is just the size to bake hams or\r\nroasting pigs, and will, when dinner-parties are given, frequently\r\nprove much more useful to the cook than an extra fire.\r\n\r\nThe fagots are sold by the hundred, and the price is usually $6 25 for\r\nthat quantity.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nOUR KITCHEN-GARDEN.\r\n\r\nAs I wish to make this little work a complete manual to the \"farm of\r\nfour acres,\" I must insert a few remarks on the management of the\r\nkitchen-garden. Ours consisted of an acre; and, large as our family\r\nwas, we did not require more than half of it to supply us with\r\nvegetables, independent of potatoes.\r\n\r\nWe strongly advise any one who may have more garden than they may want\r\nfor vegetables, to plant the surplus with potatoes. Even if the\r\n\"disease\" does affect part of the crop, the gain will still be great,\r\nproviding you keep animals to consume them; for they must indeed be\r\nbad if the pigs will not thrive on them when boiled. Poultry,\r\nlikewise, will eat them in preference to any other food.\r\n\r\nWe had something more than half an acre planted one year when the\r\ndisease was very prevalent; the crop suffered from it to a\r\nconsiderable extent, but the yield was so large that we stored\r\nsufficient to supply the family from September till the end of April,\r\nand had enough of those but slightly affected to fatten four pigs,\r\nbeside having a large bowlful boiled daily for the poultry. The worst\r\nparts were always cut out before they were boiled, and neither pigs\r\nnor poultry were allowed to touch them raw.\r\n\r\nIt is much the best plan to consume all the potatoes you may grow,\r\nrather than save any of them for seed. It will be but a slight\r\nadditional expense to have fresh kinds sent from quite a different\r\nlocality, and they will thrive better, and not be so liable to the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nThey should always be dug before the slightest appearance of frost,\r\nand place on straw in a dry place, where they can be conveniently\r\nlooked over once a fortnight, when any that show symptoms of decay\r\nshould be removed and boiled at once for the pigs. By this method very\r\nfew will be wholly wasted; instead of eating potatoes you will eat\r\npork, that is, if you have plenty of skim-milk. I do not at all know\r\nhow pigs would like them without they were mixed up with that fluid.\r\n\r\nWe have tried, with great success, planting them in rows alternately\r\nwith other vegetables. When they are all together, the haulms in wet\r\nseasons grow so rankly that they become matted together; and then, as\r\nthe air is excluded from the roots, it renders them liable to disease.\r\nWe have tried cutting the haulm off to within a few inches of the\r\nground; but this, the gardener said, proved detrimental to the roots.\r\nWe afterwards tried a row of potatoes, then cabbages, then carrots,\r\nand then again came the potatoes. We once planted them between the\r\ncurrant and gooseberry bushes, but it was as bad, or worse, than when\r\na quantity of them were by themselves; for when the trees made their\r\nmidsummer shoots the leaves quite shut out air and light from the\r\npotatoes, and when dug they proved worse than any other portions of\r\nthe crop.\r\n\r\nWe always found that the deeper the sets were placed in the ground the\r\nsounder were the roots: We tried every experiment with them; and as\r\nour gardener was both skilful and industrious, we were usually much\r\nmore fortunate with our produce than our neighbors.\r\n\r\nCarrots rank to the \"small farmer\" next in value to the potatoes; not\r\nonly pigs and cows are fond of them, but likewise horses. The pony\r\nalways improved in condition when he was allowed to have a few daily.\r\n\r\nOur arable acre was a model farm on a very small scale.  We grow in it\r\nmaize for the poultry, tares for the pigeons, lucerne for the cows,\r\nand talked of oats for the pony. This our gardener objected to, so the\r\nsurplus bit of ground was sown with parsnips, which turned out very\r\nprofitable, as both pigs and cows liked them.\r\n\r\nWe have told the reader that we reared the calf of the Strawberry cow,\r\nand it cost us hardly anything to do so, for it was fed in the winter\r\nwith the roots we had to spare. The first winter it had to consume the\r\ngreater part of the ton of mangel-wurzel we had bought \"to keep our\r\ncows together.\" Some we had boiled with potatoes for the pigs, and\r\nthey liked it very well.\r\n\r\nAn acre of land may appear a laughably small piece of ground to\r\nproduce such a variety of articles, but if well attended to the yield\r\nwill astonish those who are ignorant of gardening. The one important\r\nthing to be attended to is, to see that all seed-crops are well\r\nthinned out as soon as they are an inch above the surface. In very few\r\nkitchen-gardens is this attended to, and for want of this care a dozen\r\ncarrots, parsnips, or turnips, are allowed to stand where one would be\r\nsufficient. The one would prove a fine root; the dozen are not worth\r\nthe trouble of pulling, as they can get neither air nor room to grow.\r\nTo be well done they should be thinned by hand, and that being a\r\ntedious \"job,\" gardeners seldom can be induced to perform the work\r\nproperly.\r\n\r\nAs our ground became productive we added another cow, and more pigs\r\nand poultry, but I shall not now say with what success. This little\r\nbook in only intended for the novice in farming, and details only the\r\nresults of the first six months of our \"farm of four acres.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps I should have called it _five_ acres, as nearly the whole of\r\nthe acre of kitchen-garden was devoted to the cultivation of food for\r\nour \"stock.\"\r\n\r\nWe had a very broad sunny border at the back of the flower-garden,\r\nwhich grew nearly all the spring and summer vegetables we required:\r\nsuch as seakale, early potatoes, peas cauliflowers, and salads.\r\n\r\nWe have not yet said anything of the money we saved by our\r\nkitchen-garden, but we must add to the profits of our six months'\r\nfarming the average amount we should have paid to a green-grocer for\r\nfruit and vegetables.\r\n\r\nTwenty-five cents a day to supply thirteen persons with these\r\nnecessary articles is certainly not more than must have been expended.\r\nStill, $90 per annum is a considerable item of household expenditure,\r\nand scanty would have been the supply it would have furnished; as it\r\nwas we had a profusion of fruit of all kinds, from the humble\r\ngooseberry and currant to the finest peaches, nectarines, and hothouse\r\ngrapes, as well as an abundant supply of walnuts and filberts.\r\n\r\nHad we bought all the produce of our garden, the value would have more\r\nthan paid our gardener's wages.\r\n\r\nNor must I omit the luxury of having beautiful flowers from the\r\ngreenhouse throughout the winter; these superfluous items did not\r\nfigure in our accounts. We should have purchased but bare necessaries,\r\nand therefore entered but twenty-five cents a day for \"garden stuff\"\r\nin our housekeeping book.\r\n\r\nThose only who have lived in the country can appreciate the luxury of\r\nnot only having fruit and vegetables in abundance, but of having them\r\nfresh. Early potatoes fresh dug, peas fresh gathered, salad fresh cut,\r\nand fruit plucked just before it makes its appearance at table, are\r\nthings which cannot be purchased by the wealthiest residents in a\r\ngreat city.\r\n\r\nNot far from our residence there were large grounds, which were\r\ncultivated with fruit and vegetables for the London market. I have\r\nfrequently seen the wagons packed for Covent Garden. The freshest that\r\ncan be procured there would be considered \"stale\" in the neighborhood\r\nin which they were grown. Any fruit or vegetables in that far-famed\r\nmarket must have been gathered twenty-four hours before they could\r\nfind their way into the kitchen of the consumer; and it is not only\r\nthe time which has elapsed, but the manner in which they are packed,\r\nwhich so much deteriorates their quality.\r\n\r\nHave any of our readers ever seen the densely-loaded wagons which\r\nenter that market? The vegetables are wedged as closely together as\r\nthey can be pressed, which very soon causes, in warm weather,\r\ncabbages, greens, &c., to ferment and become unwholesome. I have often\r\nseen them so loaded in the middle of the day before they reached\r\nLondon. They are left in the hot sun till the time arrives, when the\r\nhorses are placed in them, and they begin their slow journey towards\r\ntown. This is seldom till late at night when the distance does not\r\nexceed a dozen miles.\r\n\r\nThe finer kinds of fruit such as peaches, grapes, etc., do not injure\r\nso much by being kept a few days before the are eaten; indeed, _ripe_\r\npeaches and nectarines are seldom gathered for sale: they would spoil\r\ntoo quickly to enable the fruiterer to realize much profit. They are\r\nplucked when quite hard, and then placed in boxes till they gradually\r\n_soften_; but the flavor of fruit thus treated is very inferior to\r\nthat of a peach or nectarine ripened by the sun. Seed-fruits, such as\r\nstrawberries, come very vapid in four or five hours after they have\r\nbeen picked, if they were then quite ripe.\r\n\r\nI know that the last few pages have nothing to do with \"the money we\r\nmade\" by our farm, but I wish to show the reader all the advantages\r\nwhich a country residence possess over a town one. Some persons, who\r\ncannot live without excitement, think that nothing can compensate for\r\nthe want of amusement and society.\r\n\r\nI was once speaking of the pleasure I experienced from residing in the\r\ncountry, and placed _health_ among its many advantages, when I was\r\nanswered, \"It is better to die in London than live in the country!\"\r\n\r\nI think I have said enough to cause my lady readers to wish that the\r\ntime may not be far distant when they may, like ourselves,--for we did\r\nall sorts of \"odd jobs\" in our garden,--cut their own asparagus, and\r\nassist in gathering their own peas.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed impossible to over-estimate the value of a kitchen-garden\r\nin a large family which numbers many children among its members.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE MONEY WE MADE.\r\n\r\nSome time ago we showed our first six months' accounts to a friend,\r\nwho was very sceptical as to the profit we always told him we made by\r\nour farming. After he had looked over our figures, he said,--\r\n\r\n\"Well! And after all, what have you made by your butter-making,\r\npig-killing, and fowl-slaughtering?\"\r\n\r\n\"What have we made?\" said I, indignantly.  \"Why, don't you see that,\r\nfrom July to January, we realized a profit of $9 50 from our cows, $11\r\n12 from our pigs, $9 67 from our poultry-yard, and $45 at the least\r\nfrom our kitchen-garden, which, altogether, amounts to no less a sum\r\nthan $145 29; and all this in our 'salad-days, when we were green in\r\njudgment?' What shall we not make now that we have more stock, our\r\nground well cropped, and, better still, have gained so much\r\nexperience?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said our friend, \"the more 'stock,' as you call it, you have,\r\nthe more money you will lose.\"\r\n\r\nAt this rejoinder, H. looked at the speaker as if she thought he had\r\n\"eaten of the insane root, which takes the reason prisoner.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Lose more money_!\" when you can yourself see, by looking at this\r\nbook, that in our first six months we have cleared $145 29! And,\r\nindeed, it was absurd of A. to put down so little, for she has allowed\r\n$25 for the land; and if she take that off the rent, she ought to\r\nenter it as profit from the \"farm.\" Besides, think of only putting\r\ndown a shilling a day for fruit and vegetables! Very few puddings\r\nwould the children get at that rate, supposing we were in London.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we were in London,\" interrupted I, \"you know that $90 yearly would\r\nbe as much as we could afford to expend for that item in our family. I\r\nhave made out all our farming accounts as fairly as I can. I am as\r\nwell aware as you can be that a shilling a day would not give us the\r\nluxuries of the garden as we now have them; and though that plenty may\r\nform one of the advantages of residing in the country, we have no\r\nright to put down as a saving of money the value of articles we should\r\nnever have thought of purchasing.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must allow,\" said Mr. N., \"that you appear to have been strictly\r\nhonest in your entries as regards the value of the produce you have\r\nreceived, but you do not appear to have put down your losses. You keep\r\na one-sided ledger. You have the credit, but not the debit entry. You\r\nsay nothing of the money you have lost by pigeons and rabbit-keeping.\"\r\n\r\nNow the utmost we had lost by our pigeons in the six months was $2 25,\r\nand he knew perfectly well how profitable they had since been to us.\r\nHe used jokingly to say, that we fed our guest with them in every mode\r\nof cookery so frequently, that they would alter the old grace of \"for\r\nrabbits hot,\" &c., and substitute the word \"pigeon\" in its place; so\r\nwe thought it was ungenerous to reproach the poor birds with the\r\nscanty number they gave us the first few weeks they were in our\r\ndove-cote.\r\n\r\nSilenced on that point, he returned to our unfortunate rabbit\r\nspeculation, and complained that we had kept no account of the money\r\nwe had lost by them.\r\n\r\nHere H. stopped him saying,\r\n\r\n\"Pray, Mr. N., did you not purchase your children a pony, and did it\r\nnot catch cold and die in a month afterwards? I suppose Mrs. N. did\r\nnot enter that in her housekeeper's book as meat at so much a pound,\r\nand why should we put down the cost of the rabbits in our farming\r\naccounts? No; of course it was entered among the 'sundries.'\"\r\n\r\n\"But you must allow,\" said Mr. N., \"that if you had done as I advised\r\nyou, and taken a house in a street leading into one of the squares,\r\nyou would have lived more cheaply than here. Why, your gardener's\r\nwages must more than swallow up any profit which you may _think_ you\r\nmake from your farm. You must acknowledge you would have saved that\r\nexpense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Granted,\" said I; \"but we should most likely have paid quite as much\r\nto a doctor. We never got through a year in town without a heavy bill\r\nto one; and we must have had all the expense and trouble of taking the\r\nchildren out of town during the hot weather, while the have had\r\nexcellent health ever since they have been here; and with the\r\nexception, when some kind friend like yourself has asked one of them\r\non a visit, neither of them has left home since we came here. Of one\r\nthing I am quite sure, that we are much happier than we should have\r\nbeen in London; and that in every point of view, as regards\r\nexpenditure, we are gainers. I have not entered any profit arising\r\nfrom baking at home, though the difference is just three four-pound\r\nloaves weekly; and Mrs. N. will tell you what must be the saving by\r\nour having our own laundry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough! enough!\" said Mr. N., laughingly; \"your evidence is\r\noverwhelming. You almost force me to believe that I could live in the\r\ncountry, feed my own pork, and drink my own milk, without paying half\r\na crown a pound for the one or a shilling a quart for the other, and\r\nthis was what I never before believed possible; and I am quite sure,\r\nthat if I were to put the assertion in a book, no one would believe\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" exclaimed I, \"it shall be asserted in a book whenever I can\r\nfind time to transcribe all the particulars from my diary; and I hope\r\nthat I may be able to convince my readers--should I be fortunate\r\nenough to obtain any--not only that they may keep cows, pigs, and\r\npoultry without loss, but that they may derive health, recreation, and\r\nprofit from doing so. None know better than yourself how worn-out in\r\nhealth and spirits we were when we came to this place; how oppressed\r\nwith cares and anxieties. Without occupation, we should most likely\r\nhave become habitual invalids, real or fancied; without some\r\ninducement to be out of doors, we should seldom have exerted ourselves\r\nto take the exercise necessary to restore us to health and strength.\r\nBut you will lose your train, if I keep you longer listening to the\r\nbenefits we have experienced by our residence in this place. Give the\r\nfruit and flowers to Mrs. N. with our love; and tell her, that with\r\nGod's blessing we have improved in 'mind, body, and estate,' by\r\noccupying ourselves with 'our farm of four acres.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE NEXT SIX MONTHS.\r\n\r\nIt was not my intention when I commenced this little work to do more\r\nthan give our first six months' experience in farming our four acres\r\nof land; but as perhaps the reader may think that time hardly\r\nsufficient to form a correct opinion of the advantages to be derived\r\nfrom a residence in the country, I think it as well to add some\r\nparticulars relating to the following six months.\r\n\r\nIn the spring came a new source of profit and amusement.  We commenced\r\nour labors in the poultry-yard in February, by setting a hen on\r\nthirteen eggs, which, early in March, produced the same number of\r\nchickens: these were all ready for the table in the middle of May. At\r\nthat time we could not have purchased them under $1 50 the couple.\r\n\r\nThe cost of thirty-eight chickens till ready to kill was $4 37.  We\r\nalways knew exactly the expense attending the poultry, because we had\r\na separate book from the miller, in which every article was entered as\r\nit came into the house; and as the chickens were kept distinct from\r\nthe other fowls, I could tell the exact sum they had cost us when they\r\nmade their appearance at table.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that was given them to eat was egg, boiled quite hard,\r\nchopped very fine, and mixed with bread-crumbs. After that they had\r\ngroats. I find they consumed:\r\n\r\n  Three quarts of whole groats . . . . . $   37\r\n  Two bushels of barley  . . . . . . . .   2 25\r\n  One bushel of middlings  . . . . . . .   1 12\r\n  Twenty-five lbs. of chicken-rice . . .     63\r\n               Making altogether . . . .  $4 37\r\n\r\nThe reader must be told that those thirty-eight chickens had other\r\nthings to eat than those I have put down; they had nearly all the\r\nscraps from the house, consisting of cold potatoes, bits of meat,\r\npudding, &c., and any pieces of bread which were left at table were\r\nsoaked in skim-milk; and the rice was also boiled in it. O course, in\r\na smaller family there would not have been so many \"scraps\" for them;\r\nbut, however strict you may be with children, you cannot prevent their\r\nleaving remnants on their plates, all of which would have been wasted\r\nhad it not been for the chickens and pig-tub.\r\n\r\nWe were not so fortunate with the ducks.  We did not keep any through\r\nthe winter, consequently we had to purchase the eggs, which were\r\nplaced under hens; for those eggs we paid four cents each, and out of\r\nthirteen, which was the number given to each hen, we never reared more\r\nthan eight ducks.\r\n\r\nThus, in the first instance, they cost us six cents each; and they\r\nwere likewise more expensive to feed than the chickens. They were\r\nnever fit for the table till they had cost us sixty-three cents the\r\ncouple. One reason of this was, that as the chickens had all the waste\r\nbids, they had nothing but what was bought for them; but then they\r\nwere such ducks as could not have been purchased at the poulterers'.\r\n\r\nWe never killed one unless it weighed four pounds; they used to be\r\nbrought in at night, and placed in the scale: if it was the weight I\r\nhave mentioned it was killed, if not it was respited till it did so.\r\n\r\nAt first we tried cooping them to fatten, but found it did not answer,\r\nas they moped and refused to eat by themselves; so we abandoned that\r\nplan, and were content to let them run in the meadows till fit to\r\nkill, which was not till they were three months old. They were never\r\n\"fat,\" but very meaty, and fine flavored,--not in the least like those\r\nwhich are bought, which, however fat they may appear before they are\r\ncooked, come to table half the size they were when put down to the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nI remember being rather puzzled once when resident in London.  I\r\nwanted a particularly fine couple of ducks for a \"company dinner,\" and\r\nwent myself to the shop where I dealt to order them.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Mrs. Todd,\" said I, \"the ducks I require are not fat ducks, but\r\nmeaty ones; the last I had from you had nothing on them when they came\r\nto table, though they looked so plump when you sent them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, ma'am,\" was the rejoinder.  \"I know just what you want; but\r\nthey are very difficult to get: you want _running_ ducks.\"\r\n\r\nI was obliged to ask what she meant by the term _running_, and was\r\nthen informed that the ducks for the London market were put up to\r\nfatten, and as they were crammed with grease to hasten the process,\r\nthe fat all went into the dripping-pan. Now a _running_ duck was one\r\nwell fed, and allowed to roam or _run_ till it was killed. I am now\r\nable from experience to say, that they are incomparably superior to\r\ntheir fattened brethren.\r\n\r\nThe novice in poultry-rearing must be told that it is almost useless\r\nto set a hen in very hot weather. As we had more eggs than were\r\nrequired, we did so during part of June, July, and August, but had\r\nvery bad fortune with them; the hen seldom hatching more than three or\r\nfour, and those puny little creatures.\r\n\r\nThere is an old Kentish proverb which says,\r\n\r\n  \"Between the sickle and the scythe,\r\n   Whatever's born will never thrive;\"\r\n\r\nand as it was just between the hay and corn-harvest that we tried to\r\nrear our ducks and chickens, I am induced to believe that, like many\r\nother old saws, it was founded on experience. They may be reared in\r\nSeptember, though they require great care, and must not be allowed to\r\nrun on the grass, which at that season is seldom dry.\r\n\r\nA friend once told me she reared a brood of seventeen chickens, which\r\nwere hatched the last week in September; they were placed in an empty\r\ngreenhouse, and were consequently kept warm and dry. March is _the_\r\nmonth for poultry; the hatches are better, and they grow much more\r\nrapidly than at any other time.\r\n\r\nI am quite sure that a poultry-yard may be made very profitable to any\r\none who will bestow a little trouble on it. Great care must be taken\r\nwith the young chickens at night; the hen should be securely cooped\r\nwith them: for want of this precaution we in one night lost eight,\r\nwhen they were a few days old, being, as we supposed, carried off by\r\nthe cats.\r\n\r\nThe best food for ducks when first hatched is bread and milk; in a few\r\ndays barley-meal, wetted with water into balls about as big as peas,\r\nshould be given to them. It is usual, as soon as both ducks and\r\nchickens come out of the shell, to put a pepper-corn down their\r\nthroats. I don't know that it is really of service to them, but it is\r\na time-honored custom, and so perhaps it is as well to follow it.\r\n\r\nAs for our butter-making, it continued to prosper; we had some little\r\ntrouble with it in the spring, when the weather set in suddenly very\r\nhot. It was certainly much more difficult to reduce the temperature of\r\nthe cream to 55' than it was to raise it to that degree.\r\n\r\nI often thought with vain longing of the shop in the Strand, where we\r\nused to purchase Wenham Lake Ice: how firm would the butter have come,\r\ncould we have had a few lumps to put in the churn half and hour before\r\nwe required to use it!\r\n\r\nFarmers' wives tell us, that to get firm butter in very hot weather\r\nthey get up at three o'clock in the morning, in order that it may be\r\nmade before the sun becomes powerful. Now this is a thing that would\r\nnot have suited H. or myself at all, and therefore we never mustered\r\nup courage to attempt it.\r\n\r\nOne day in March--and this is the last disaster I have to record\r\nconcerning our butter--we were particularly anxious to have it good,\r\nas we expected visitors, to whom we had frequently boasted of our\r\nskill as dairywomen: the day was very warm, and the cream appeared\r\nmuch thicker than usual; we churned for more than an hour without its\r\nappearing to undergo any change; we frequently removed the lid to see\r\nif there was any sign of butter coming, but each time we were\r\ndisheartened when we discovered it looked just the same as when placed\r\nin the churn. At last the handle went round as easily as if no cream\r\nwere in it, and presently it began to run over the top of the churn.\r\nWhen we looked in a curious sight presented itself: the cream had\r\nrisen to the top, just as milk does when it boils! We were greatly\r\nastonished. In nine months' butter-making we had seen nothing like it.\r\n\r\nTom, who milked the cows was supposed to know something of the art of\r\nchurning; he was, therefore, called into the dairy: as soon as he saw\r\nthe state of the matter he exclaimed, \"Why, the cream's gone to\r\nsleep!\"\r\n\r\n\"The cream gone to sleep!\"  What in the world could that mean?  Such a\r\npropensity we had never discovered in cream before; we could gain no\r\nsolution of the mystery from Tom; all he said was, that we must go on\r\nchurning till it \"waked up.\"\r\n\r\nH. and myself had been hard at work for two hours, so willingly\r\nyielded to his request that he might be allowed to rouse the cream\r\nfrom its slumber. He, the cook, and housemaid, churned away by turns\r\ntill seven in the evening, but the sleep of the cream remained\r\nunbroken, and as it was then considered a hopeless affair, the\r\nslothful fluid was consigned to the pig-tub.\r\n\r\nNow we have never felt quite sure of our butter since.  Every time we\r\nchurn there is a lurking fear that the cream may choose to take a nap;\r\nhowever, it is as yet the first and last time in our experience.\r\n\r\nI can give no advice to my readers on the subject, because I am wholly\r\nignorant on the subject, though I have consulted every farmer's wife\r\nin the neighborhood on the matter. They all say that cream will go to\r\nsleep sometimes, though it usually wakes up after a few hours.* [I\r\nhave since been told by an old woman conversant with sleepy cream,\r\nthat a quart of milk nearly boiling hot will wake it up.] Perhaps,\r\nafter all, we were too impatient, and should not have given in after\r\n_only_ nine hours' churning. With this solitary exception our\r\nbutter-making progressed as favorably as we could desire.\r\n\r\nI do not quite know how to believe the stories I am told of wonderful\r\ncows which my friends are fortunate enough to possess. One gentleman\r\nhas informed me that he has one which gives fifteen pounds of butter\r\nweekly. Now we have had several, but never made more on the average\r\nthan eight pounds per week. I believe that a great deal depends on the\r\nmanner in which they are milked, and once in the hands of a beginner\r\nin that art the cows decreased in milk so rapidly, that we did not get\r\nmore than a gallon daily from both animals; after they had been three\r\nweeks under his management we changed the milker, but did not get\r\nanything like the proper quantity again till after they had calved.\r\n\r\nI believe the usual average is one pound of butter from every ten\r\nquarts of milk. Ours used to give us thirteen or fourteen quarts each\r\ndaily, and yet we never made more than eight pounds. We used about two\r\nquarts of new milk, so that if ten quarts will give a pound of butter,\r\nwe did not get so much as we ought. Still we were very well satisfied\r\nwith the produce we received.\r\n\r\nThere requires management with two cows, in order that one may always\r\nbe in full milk when the other calves. If you rear a calf for the\r\nbutcher, it will require the whole of the milk for six or seven weeks,\r\nwhich is about the age they are killed for fine veal. We once--it was\r\nin the winter--received $26 for one. With two cows this may usually be\r\ndone, and its is more profitable than making butter. Where only one is\r\nkept, it is better to part with the calf when a few days old, and then\r\nthe price is $5.\r\n\r\nIf a lady wishes her dairy to be very nicely finished, she should have\r\nall the articles she requires of glass, instead of wood and\r\nearthenware. Everything for the diary of that material can be\r\npurchased in Leicester Square, and certainly, if expense had been no\r\nobject to us, we should much have preferred a glass churn, pans, &c.\r\nThey have the great advantage of being kept beautifully clean with\r\nvery little labor; but they are so liable to be broken, that they\r\nshould never be used unless servants are very careful. A marble table\r\nis, however, in every respect better than a board to make the butter\r\nupon. It is expensive at first, but will, with ordinary care, last\r\nseveral generations of butter-makers.\r\n\r\nWhilst on the subject of the dairy, I must say a few words respecting\r\nthe great care required in washing the articles used in it. As soon as\r\nthe butter was taken from the churn I was in the habit of half filling\r\nit with boiling water, into which I had put some lumps of soda, and\r\nthen turning the handle a few times, in order that it might be well\r\nwashed round. It was then left till it was convenient for \"cook\" to\r\ncleanse all the utensils we had used.\r\n\r\nFrom some cause or other I neglected for two or three weeks to do\r\nthis, and one day, when the freshmade butter was brought to table,\r\nthere were complaints that it was _cheesy_; it certainly had a\r\npeculiar and very unpleasant taste, for which we could not account.\r\n\r\nThe next time it was made it had the same fault; and it then occurred\r\nto me that it might be the churn. I accordingly returned to my old\r\nmode of washing it, and never after was there a complaint of any\r\nunpleasant flavor in the butter.\r\n\r\nI mention this to show the amateur dairywoman how very essential is\r\ncleanliness in every article she uses. A regular dairymaid would have\r\nknown this, but a town-servant thinks that if she washes a thing it is\r\nsufficient: but more than mere washing is required; every article must\r\nbe _scrubbed_ with soap, wood-ashes, and soda, and then placed for\r\nhours in the open air.\r\n\r\nNow glass is much easier kept sweet and clean, and for that reason is\r\ngreatly to be preferred; but I am writing for those who may wish to\r\nreap profit from their \"farm of four acres,\" and I fear little would\r\nbe gained if nothing but glass were used in the dairy.\r\n\r\nOur land turned out better the second summer than the first.  We made\r\nnearly two tons and a half of hay from each acre. We were enabled to\r\nmow the whole three acres, as we had \"common rights\" in our\r\nneighborhood, where the cows could pasture during the spring. Had we\r\nbeen without this privilege we could have mown only two acres, and as\r\nhay was $21 the load, the additional acre was worth $50 to us, with\r\nthe exception of $3 75 for making it. We were advised to have an\r\nafter-crop, but did not; it would have made the land very poor for the\r\nnext year, so that what we gained in hay we must have expended in\r\nmanure.\r\n\r\nWe were well satisfied with the profit we derived from our pigs during\r\nthis second six months. All the summer we kept four, at an expense of\r\nfifty-eight cents weekly, which was expended for two bushels of fine\r\npollard (bran and meal).\r\n\r\nWe had such an abundance of vegetables from the garden and orchard,\r\nthat we must have wasted cartloads, if we had not kept pigs to consume\r\nthem. As soon as the hay was carried they were turned into the\r\nmeadows, and suffered to remain there till they were put up to fatten;\r\na process which pigs must go through, though ducks can dispense with\r\nit. I have already stated the expense of fattening them, and we never\r\nfound it vary more than a shilling or two in a pig.\r\n\r\nWe always found for our family that a bacon pig of sixteen stone (244\r\npounds) was the best size, and for porkers about eight (112 pounds).\r\n\r\nOur fruit was as plentiful as our vegetables,--indeed we might have\r\nsold the surplus for many dollars; but we soon found that to do so was\r\nto lose _caste_ in the neighborhood. One piece of extravagance we were\r\nguilty of the first winter and spring we passed at A. The gardener had\r\na little fire in the grapery during the severe weather, because he had\r\nplaced some plants in it. We were told we could continue it till the\r\ngrapes ripened for a \"mere nothing.\" Now \"mere nothings\" mount up to a\r\n\"considerable something.\" The coal and coke consumed before they were\r\nripe cost $20. It is true we had them in July instead of September,\r\nbut we should have liked them quite as well in that month.\r\n\r\nIt was a bad grape year, too,--at least with us.  I don't think we cut\r\nmore than twenty pounds weight. Hothouse grapes are not dear at $1 the\r\npound; but we should have had them equally good by waiting two months\r\nlater, when they would have cost us nothing.\r\n\r\nHad we purchased the produce we received from our garden during the\r\nyear, it would have been worth two guineas weekly. Our peaches,\r\napricots, and nectarines, were abundant, and very fine. We had two\r\nsplendid walnut-trees, and a mulberry-tree of immense size, which was\r\nan object of special abhorrence to \"nurse,\" as for more than two\r\nmonths in the summer the children's frocks, pinners, &c., were dyed\r\nwith the juice of the fruit. They could hardly pass near it in the\r\nseason without some of the ripe berries falling on their heads, and it\r\nwas hardly possible to prevent them escaping from her to pick them up.\r\nMulberry-pudding made its appearance often on the nursery-table, and\r\njars of mulberry-jam were provided to secure the same dainty through\r\nthe winter.\r\n\r\nThe luxury of a good garden can hardly be appreciated till you have\r\nbeen in possession of one, more especially where there are many\r\nchildren. The way we used to preserve currants, gooseberries, plums,\r\ndamsons, and, indeed, almost every description of fruit, was this: The\r\nwide-mouth bottles which are sold for the purpose were filled with\r\nfruit, six ounces of powdered loaf-sugar was shaken in among it; the\r\nbottles were then tied down as closely as possible with bladder, and\r\nplaced up to the neck in a copper, or large saucepan, of cold water,\r\nwhich was allowed to come slowly to the boil. They remained in it till\r\nthe water was quite cold, when they were taken from the water and\r\nwiped quite dry. Before placing them in the store-room the bottle was\r\nturned upside down, in order to see that they were perfectly\r\nair-tight, for on this depends the fruit keeping good. The fruit will\r\nsink down to about the middle of the bottle, and we once tried to fill\r\nthem up with some from another, but opening them admitted the air, and\r\nthe contents did not keep well. If properly done, they will be good at\r\nthe end of a year.\r\n\r\nIf any lady undertake the management of a four-acre farm, she must\r\nexpect it to occupy a great deal of her time; if she leaves it to\r\nservants, however honest, she will lose by it. It is not that things\r\nare stolen, but that they are wasted, unless the mistress herself\r\nknows what quantities of barley, oats, etc., her poultry and pigs\r\nconsume; and unless she look daily into her dairy and see that the\r\nmild is well skimmed, half the cream will be thrown into the wash-tub.\r\n\r\nA six-months' longer experience of the country only confirmed my\r\nsister and myself in the conviction that we had in every way made a\r\nmost desirable change when we quitted London for our small farm; but\r\nif we had been too fine or too indolent to look after our dairy and\r\npoultry-yard, I believe that our milk, butter, eggs, poultry, and\r\npork, would have cost us quite as much as we could have purchased them\r\nfor in town.\r\n\r\nAll the good things we were daily consuming in the country would have\r\ncome to us in London,\r\n\r\n\"Like angels' visits, few and far between.\"\r\n\r\nI know that many of our old friends were really shocked when we told\r\nthem, laughingly, of our new pursuits, and that the butter they so\r\nmuch praised, and the apricot-cheese they ate with so much gust, were\r\nmanufactured by our own hands. We were \"poor-thinged\" to our faces in\r\na very pitying manner, but we always laughed at these compassionate\r\npeople, and endeavored to convince them we spoke the truth in sober\r\nearnest, when we assured them we found great amusement in our new\r\npursuits. They shook their heads and sighed in such a manner, that we\r\nknew perfectly well that, as soon as we were out of ear-shot, they\r\nwould say, \"Poor things! It is very sad, but they are quite right to\r\ntry and make the best of it.\" I believe some of them thought that it\r\nwas impossible we could have \"souls above butter;\" for a lady who\r\ncalled one day, taking up one of Mudie's volumes from the table,\r\nsaid,--\r\n\r\n\"It is possible you care to subscribe to Mudies's?\"\r\n\r\n\"And why should we not care to do so?\" replied H.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" was the answer, \"I do not see any connection between a love of\r\nreading and a love of butter-making.\"\r\n\r\nNow I do not think that either of us had any love of butter-making;\r\nand if we could have afforded to give $100 a year to a dairymaid, no\r\ndoubt we should have left all to her management; but as it was we were\r\nobliged to buy it--and very bad it was in our town--or make it\r\nourselves: nor do either my sister or myself regret our resolution to\r\ndo so.\r\n\r\nAt first we were quite proud of our skill, and told every one of our\r\nsuccess with great triumph. Now--for womanhood is weak--we are content\r\nto hear our dairymaid praised for her beautiful butter by our\r\nacquaintance, and Tom extolled for his care of the chickens. It is\r\nonly our friends, among whom I reckon my readers, who know that the\r\nbutter is made, and the chickens fed, by the mistresses of \"the\r\nfour-acre farm.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nOUR PONY.\r\n\r\nI have been told by several friends that, in order to render this\r\nlittle book complete, I should add a chapter detailing the expenses we\r\nincurred by keeping a pony and carriage. Some persons imagine that\r\nthis is an article of luxury which may well be dispensed with; but,\r\nthough it may not be and absolute necessary, the expense attending one\r\nis so slight, in comparison with the comfort and pleasure derived from\r\nits possession, that I believe such of my readers as may contemplate\r\nresiding in the country will readily agree with me, when I have told\r\nthem the amount it will cost them to keep it,--that if it is a luxury,\r\nit is one of the very cheapest in which they can indulge.\r\n\r\nWithout such a convenience a carriage must be hired every time any\r\nmember of the family has occasion to go to the railway station; and\r\nbesides that, it is useful for bringing home a variety of articles\r\nwhich in the country are frequently purchased at places five or six\r\nmiles from home. Then it is a great pleasure to be able to meet your\r\nfriends at the station, whenever they are kind enough to leave London\r\nfor the purpose of passing a few days with you in the country.\r\n\r\nMy sister and myself contrived to extract profit as well as pleasure\r\nfrom our little equipage. During the summer months we frequently drove\r\nup to London; the short journey was very pleasant, and this mode of\r\nmaking it possessed the great advantage of costing nothing but 63\r\ncents for the pony, and 12 cents for turnpikes. Not that we had the\r\ntemerity to drive through London. We always left the pony two miles\r\nbefore we reached town, with strict orders to the civil ostler to\r\nwhose care we confided him to great care of him, and be sure and give\r\nhim a \"good feed.\" We then proceeded on our way in a cab, which cost\r\nus no more than we should have paid for one from the station.\r\n\r\nWhere there is a gentleman in the family, a dogcart is the most\r\nconvenient vehicle which can be kept; but as that would not be\r\nsuitable for a lady, we contrived to make the back seat of the\r\ncarriage do duty for the well of the dog-cart, and it was astonishing\r\nhow many light packages we managed to \"stow away\" in it. I will not\r\ndilate on the pleasant drives through quiet lanes, of the delight\r\nafforded to the children when allowed to have a ride on \"Bobby,\" nor\r\nof the great facility it gave us of being out of doors in winter,\r\nwhen, as was very frequently the case, the state of the roads was such\r\nas to render walking an impossibility; still, I hope I have stated\r\nsufficient to give my readers a good idea of the great pleasure they\r\nwill derive from keeping a pony; and I will now, with the bills of the\r\nmiller and farrier before me, proceed to show the sum for which it may\r\nbe kept. Our pony cost for food, from the 4th of January to the 24th\r\nof December in the same year, $46.66. He consumed during that period\r\nfive quarters of oats, at $8 the quarter, and five bushels of beans,\r\nwhich cost $6.66. The farrier's bill for the same time amounted to\r\n$5.91. Perhaps it will be as well to copy this account, as it will\r\nclearly show how often it is requisite to change the shoes of a horse.\r\nOf course a great deal must depend on the quantity of work he does;\r\nours was certainly not spared, though we do not deserve the character\r\nso usually given to ladies, of being unmerciful to horses: \"running\r\nthem off their legs,\" \"thinking they can never get enough out of the\r\npoor beasts,\" \"driving them as if they thought they could go for\r\never,\" are accusations brought against the ladies of a family where\r\nhorses are kept.\r\n\r\nThe following is a copy of the bill for our pony's shoes for twelve\r\nmonths:--\r\n\r\n    Feb. 24.    Four removes               $0.33\r\n    March 22.   Four shoes                   .75\r\n    April 20.   Four removes                 .33\r\n    May 5.      Two shoes                    .37 1/2\r\n    June 9.     Four shoes                   .75\r\n    July 8.     Four shoes                   .75\r\n    Aug. 9      Four shoes                   .75\r\n    Sept. 1.    Four shoes                   .75\r\n    Oct. 11.    Two shoes                    .37 1/2\r\n    Oct. 25.    Two shoes                    .37 1/2\r\n    Dec. 24.    Two shoes                    .37 1/2\r\n                                           $5.91\r\n\r\n    Add to this the miller's bill         $46.66\r\n                                          $52.57\r\n\r\nand we have the whole expense of keeping a pony for one year.  \"Oh!\r\nbut,\" some one may exclaim, \"you have put down nothing for straw and\r\nhay, and horses require a great deal of both.\" Quite true; but then in\r\nthe country, if you do not keep a horse, you must buy manure for your\r\ngarden, and that will cost you quite as much as if you purchased\r\nstraw; and as for the hay, did it not come off the \"four-acre farm?\"\r\n\r\nIt is one of the great advantages of the country that nothing is lost,\r\nand thus the straw which figures so largely in the bill of a London\r\ncorn-chandler, and which, when converted into manure, is the\r\nperquisite of your groom, becomes in the country the means of\r\nrendering your garden productive.\r\n\r\nBefore I resided in the country the pony cost me more than four times\r\nthe sum I have mentioned; the stable was apart from the house, and I\r\nknew nothing for months of the bills run up on his account. I had once\r\na bill sent in for sugar! \"Why, George, what can the pony want with\r\nsugar?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, ma'am, you said some time ago that the pony looked thin, so\r\nlately I have always mixed sugar with his corn; nothing fattens a\r\nhorse like sugar.\"\r\n\r\nNow what could I complain of?  This man had been recommended to me as\r\na \"treasure,\" and one who would do his duty by the pony, which, I may\r\nmention, was a very beautiful one, and a great pet; so if George\r\nconsidered sugar good for him, what could I do but pay the bill, and\r\nsay, \"Let him have sugar, by all means?\" Not that \"Bobby\" was a bit the\r\nfatter or better for having his corn sweetened. An intimate friend of\r\nmine, who always kept three or four horses, laughed outright when I\r\ntold him that the pony had consumed such a quantity of sugar, and\r\nexpressed his opinion that very little of that article had ever been\r\nin his manger. Under the same superintendence \"Bobby\" wore out four\r\ntimes the number of shoes; and as at that time I had to purchase hay\r\nand straw as well as corn, all on the same scale of magnitude, the\r\nexpense of keeping the little carriage really did cost more than the\r\nconvenience attending it was worth; and had not the pony been the gift\r\nof a beloved friend, we should have parted with it when we quitted\r\nLondon, as at that time we were ignorant how cheaply it could be\r\nmaintained in the country. There we had a servant who was content with\r\nhis wages, and did not seek to make them greater by combining with\r\ntradesmen to defraud his employers. If any of my readers commence\r\nkeeping a pony in the country, they may rely that it need not cost\r\nthem a penny more than I have put down. Of course they must have the\r\nhay from their own grounds, and neither reckon the cost of the straw\r\nnor the labor of the man who attends to the pony. Ours did all the\r\n\"jobs\" about the place--cleaned the knives and shoes, milked the cows,\r\nfed the pigs and poultry, helped in the gardens, and, in short, made\r\nhimself \"generally useful.\" Now, a servant who is able and willing to\r\ndo all this, besides properly attending to a pony and carriage, is\r\nvery difficult to be met with, but he is absolutely necessary for a\r\nplace in the country where economy has to be studied.\r\n\r\nSomething must be allowed yearly for the wear and tear of carriage,\r\nharness, etc., but it need not be much. Any gentleman can easily\r\ncalculate the sum which may fairly be allowed for these items; I only\r\nthink it my part to show the expense attending a pony in the country;\r\nand though those who have been in the habit of keeping horses in\r\nLondon, either in a livery or private stable, may think it impossible\r\nto maintain one for $52.57 yearly, let them leave town for a four-acre\r\nfarm, and they will find that I have spoken the truth on this point,\r\nas well as on all the other subjects of which I have given my\r\nexperience in this little volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nIt is with considerable diffidence the writer ventures to give the\r\npublic this slight sketch of her experience in farming four acres of\r\nland.\r\n\r\nWhen she finally resolved to fix her residence in the country, she was\r\nwholly ignorant how she ought to manage, so that the small quantity of\r\nland she rented might, if not a source of profit, be at least no loss.\r\n\r\nShe was told by a friend, who for a short time had tried \"a little\r\nplace\" at Chiselhurst, that it was very possible to lose a\r\nconsiderable sum yearly by under taking to farm a very small quantity\r\nof land. \"Be quite sure,\" said the friendly adviser--\"and remember, I\r\nspeak from experience--that whatever animals you may keep, the expense\r\nattending them will be treble the value of the produce you receive.\r\nYour cows will die, or, for want of being properly looked after, will\r\nsoon cease to give any milk; your pigs will cost you more for food\r\nthan will buy the pork four times over; your chickens and ducks will\r\nstray away, or be stolen; your garden-produce will, if worth anything,\r\nfind its way to Covent Garden; and each quarter your bills from the\r\nseedsman and miller will amount to as much as would supply you with\r\nmeat, bread, milk, butter, eggs, and poultry, in London.\"\r\n\r\nCertainly this was rather a black state of things to look forward to;\r\nbut the conviction was formed, after mature reflection, that a\r\nresidence some miles from town was the one best suited to the writer's\r\nfamily. She was compelled to acknowledge to those friends who advised\r\nher to the contrary, her ignorance on most things appertaining to the\r\nmode of life she proposed to commence, but trusted to that\r\noften-talked-of commodity, common sense, to prevent her being ruined\r\nby farming four acres of land.\r\n\r\nShe thought, if she could not herself discover how to manage, she\r\nmight acquire the requisite knowledge from some of the little books\r\nshe had purchased on subjects connected with \"rural economy.\" They\r\nproved, however, quite useless. They appeared to the writer to be\r\nmerely compilations from larger works; and, like the actors in the\r\nbarn, who played the tragedy of \"Hamlet,\" and omitted the character of\r\nthe hero, so did these books leave out the very things which, from the\r\ntitle-pages, the purchaser expected to find in them.\r\n\r\nSome time after experience had shown how butter could be made\r\nsuccessfully, a lady, who had been for years resident in the country,\r\nsaid, during a morning call, \"My dairy-maid is gone away ill, and the\r\ncook makes the butter; but it is so bad we cannot eat it: and besides\r\nthat nuisance, she has this morning given me notice to leave. She says\r\nshe did not 'engage' to 'mess' about in the dairy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the writer, \"why not make the butter yourself, till you\r\ncan suit yourself with a new servant?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have tried,\" said the visitor, \"but cannot do it.  My husband is\r\nvery particular about the butter being good, so I was determined to\r\nsee if I could not have some that he could eat; therefore I _pored_\r\nover Mrs. Rundle, and other books, for a whole day, but could not find\r\nhow to begin. None of them told me how to _make_ the butter, though\r\nseveral gave directions for potting it down when it was made. I made\r\nthe boy churn for more than three hours yesterday morning, but got no\r\nbutter after all. _It would not come!_ The weather was very cold, and\r\nit occurred to the listener to ask the lady _where_ the boy churned,\r\nand where the cream had been kept during the previous night.\r\n\r\n\"Why, in the dairy, to be sure,\" was the answer; \"and my feet became\r\nso chilled by standing there, that I can hardly put them to the ground\r\nsince. Cook could not succeed more than I did, and said, the last time\r\nshe made it, it was between four and five hours before the butter\r\ncame; and then, as I have told you, it was not eatable.\"\r\n\r\nThe writer explained to her friend that the reason why she could not\r\nget the butter, as well as why cook's was so bad, was on account of\r\nthe low temperature of the cream when it was put into the churn. She\r\nthen gave her plain directions how to proceed for the future, and was\r\ngratified by receiving a note from her friend, in a couple of days,\r\ncontaining her thanks for the \"very plain directions;\" and adding, \"I\r\ncould not have thought it was so little trouble to procure _good_\r\nbutter, and shall for the future be independent of a saucy dairymaid.\"\r\n\r\nI believe that a really clever servant will never give any one\r\nparticulars respecting her work. She wraps them up in an impenetrable\r\nmystery. Like the farmers' wives, who, to our queries, gave no other\r\nanswer than, \"Why, that depends,\" they take care that no one shall be\r\nany the wiser for the questions asked.\r\n\r\nThe reader may safely follow the directions given in these pages; not\r\none has been inserted that has not been tested by the writer. To those\r\nwho are already conversant with bread-making, churning, etc., they may\r\nappear needlessly minute; but we hope the novice may, with very little\r\ntrouble, become mistress of the subjects to which they refer.\r\n\r\nEven if a lady does keep a sufficient number of servants to perform\r\nevery domestic duty efficiently, still it may prove useful to be able\r\nto give instructions to one who may, from some accidental\r\ncircumstance, be called on to undertake a work to which she has been\r\nunaccustomed.\r\n\r\nA friend of the writer's, a lady of large fortune, and mistress of a\r\nvery handsome establishment, said, when speaking of her dairy, \"My\r\nneighborhood has the character of making very bad butter; mine is\r\ninvariably good, and I always get a penny a pound more for it at the\r\n'shop' than my neighbors. If I have occasion to change the dairymaid,\r\nand the new one sends me up bad butter, I tell her of it. If it occurs\r\nthe second time, I make no more complaints; I go down the next\r\nbutter-day, and make it entirely myself, having her at my side the\r\nwhole time. I find I never have to complain again. She sees how it is\r\nmade, and she is compelled to own it is good. I believe that a servant\r\nwho is worth keeping will follow any directions, and take any amount\r\nof trouble, rather than see 'missus' a second time enter the kitchen\r\nor dairy to do her work.\"\r\n\r\nPerhaps the allusion this lady made to the \"shop\" may puzzle the\r\nLondon reader, but in country places, where more butter is made in a\r\ngentleman's family than is required for the consumption of the\r\nhousehold, it is sent to--what is frequently--_the_ \"shop\" of the\r\nplace, and sold for a penny per pound less than the price for which it\r\nis retailed by the shopkeeper. The value of the butter is set off\r\nagainst tea, sugar, cheese, and various other articles required in the\r\nfamily in which the butter is made.\r\n\r\nWhen the writer purchased a third cow, it was in anticipation of\r\nsending any surplus butter to \"shop,\" and receiving groceries in\r\nexchange, nor has she been disappointed.\r\n\r\nEvery month's additional experience strengthens her conviction of the\r\nadvantages to be derived from living in the country; and she takes\r\nfarewell of her readers, in the hope that she has succeeded in conving\r\nthem that a \"farm of four acres\" may be made a source of health,\r\nprofit, and amusement, though many of their \"town\" friends may\r\nthreaten them with ruin, should they be rash enough to disregard their\r\nadvice to take a house in a \"nice quiet street,\" leading into one of\r\nthe squares.",
