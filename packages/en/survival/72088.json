The thunder battered\r\nagainst the surrounding hills and went off grumbling into the distance,\r\nto be swallowed up in louder detonations. Trees bent before the fury\r\nof the wind like a bow in the hands of an archer. Some of the smaller\r\ntrunks, wrenched from their roots, fell with a thud to the ground.\r\nCastanha nuts, like pebbles from the sling shot of a giant, pelted the\r\njungle in a deadly hail. It was a devastating storm that for the time\r\nsubdued all other forces of the jungle.\r\n\r\nNone but the ears of the boy of the jungle could have detected that\r\nfaint sound through the clamor of the tempest. None but the eyes of\r\nBomba could have seen that something that stood out like a black blot\r\nagainst the vivid background of the lightning.\r\n\r\nBomba crouched lower beneath the jutting rock and one hand slipped to\r\nthe belt at his waist, firmly gripping the handle of his razor-edged\r\nknife. Whether man, beast or reptile threatened, Bomba was not to be\r\ncaught off his guard.\r\n\r\nA crash of thunder that seemed to rip the very heavens asunder, a flash\r\nof lightning like a jagged finger of fire searing the sky, and again\r\nBomba saw that blot, but this time more distinctly.\r\n\r\nWith a smothered exclamation, Bomba slipped into the narrow gully that\r\nran behind the rock, a gully, now half filled with water but thickly\r\nfringed with bushes, concealing him from the eyes of his enemies.\r\n\r\nFor the flash of lightning had revealed no lurking jaguar, hungry for\r\nits prey. The foes of Bomba were of a far deadlier kind, deadlier\r\neven than the wicked anaconda with its folds of steel. For these were\r\nheadhunters--bloodthirsty, cruel, cunning--bucks of the tribe of the\r\ndreaded chief, Nascanora.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of Bomba, keen as those of the big cats that stalked the\r\njungle, had counted three of these in the brief space of the lightning\r\nflash. They stood like naked statues, each gripping a spear, the eyes\r\nof each prodding the deeper shadows beneath the overhanging rock.\r\n\r\nRage was in the heart of the jungle boy, and fear; fear not for himself\r\nbut for Cody Casson, his one white friend who had reared him from\r\ninfancy; Cody Casson, now frail and wasted, who lay helpless, perhaps\r\nclose to death, in the hut of Pipina, the squaw.\r\n\r\nBomba knew with a sure instinct the reason for the presence of the\r\nheadhunters of Nascanora, now far from their tribal abode in the shadow\r\nof the Giant Cataract. They were once more on the trail of Casson;\r\nCasson whom Bomba loved. They would try to capture him, take him to\r\ntheir village and torture him, and then, when death had brought an end\r\nto his sufferings, place his head on Nascanora’s wigwam.\r\n\r\nThe hand of Bomba clutched convulsively at the handle of his knife. He\r\nvowed to the gods of the thunder and the rain that he would protect his\r\nfriend to the last gasp; that if Casson were to die, he, Bomba, would\r\ndie with him, stretched across his body.\r\n\r\nBut it was too early yet to think of death. Too long had Bomba braved\r\nthe perils of the jungle not to know the fleetness of his foot, the\r\nsureness of his eye, the strength of his muscles. Bomba had fought the\r\nbraves of Nascanora’s tribe before; had beaten and outwitted them. He\r\nwould fight them again, matching his strength against their strength,\r\nhis brain against their brain. And he told himself that Bomba would win.\r\n\r\nStealthily as a shadow, still crouching low behind the bushes, Bomba\r\ncrept along the gully, his ears strained for any sound that might\r\nindicate pursuit.\r\n\r\nHad they seen him? Had his form beneath the shadow of the rock been as\r\nplain to them as theirs to him?\r\n\r\nBomba doubted this, for the rock was sheltered by the overhanging limbs\r\nof trees, while the Indians had stood up straight, clearly outlined\r\nagainst the tangled undergrowth of the jungle.\r\n\r\nThe advantage so far was Bomba’s. But how long could he hope to retain\r\nit?\r\n\r\nBomba pushed against the wind almost as against a solid obstacle. It\r\nrequired all his strength to keep his feet. The lightning, that was now\r\nalmost incessant, filled the forest with weird light, illuminating the\r\ntree branches and swaying vines in a fantastic tracery. Heavy ropes\r\nof creepers swung from the branches above the boy’s head and wrapped\r\nthemselves about him, impeding his progress.\r\n\r\nWith teeth gritted, Bomba fought the fury of the storm. It was\r\nterrible, but not so ruthless and relentless as the enemy he was\r\ntrying to leave behind.\r\n\r\nAn unusually vivid flash of lightning illumined a faint trail at\r\nBomba’s right. He would leave the gully here and strike homeward toward\r\nthe cabin of Pipina, where Casson lay, all unknowing of the danger that\r\nthreatened him. He had been on his way there when the storm had risen\r\nand forced him to seek shelter beneath the lee of the rock.\r\n\r\nA tree fell with the sound of rending branches directly in front of\r\nhim. The outflung boughs caught him, swept him backward; castanha\r\nnuts pelted about him, now just grazing him and again leaving painful\r\nbruises on his body.\r\n\r\nHe freed himself and struggled doggedly onward. It was not far to the\r\nhut of Pipina now, but, pursued by the demons of the storm and having\r\nto hack his way at times through the underbrush, each yard had to be\r\nfought for.\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, Bomba stopped.\r\n\r\nHis hand grasped tightly the hilt of his knife, his eyes narrowed as\r\nthey searched an especially heavy clump of bushes.\r\n\r\nAnother flash illumined the thicket and Bomba saw the ugly head of a\r\njararaca, the rattlesnake of the South American jungle, upraised to\r\nstrike.\r\n\r\nAs the world was again bathed in blackness the serpent sprang. At the\r\nsame instant Bomba dodged, his hand darted forward and caught the\r\nreptile by the neck. His fingers closed upon that slimy neck like a\r\nring of steel. The snake writhed fearfully and threw its coils about\r\nBomba’s arm.\r\n\r\nHad the lad’s fingers relaxed the merest trifle, the fangs would have\r\nfound their mark. But those fingers kept up their relentless pressure\r\nuntil the thrashing coils gradually grew limp.\r\n\r\nTo make assurance doubly sure, Bomba beat the reptile’s head against a\r\nrock, then flung the hideous thing far from him into the bushes.\r\n\r\n“The snake is quick,” said the boy to himself, in justified pride, “but\r\nBomba is quicker.”\r\n\r\nHe plunged forward again, but in a moment stopped, listening intently.\r\nWhat was that?\r\n\r\nOnly the threshing of the rain, the roar of the wind?\r\n\r\nNo, it was different from either of these. It was the sound of one or\r\nseveral bodies pressing through the heavy undergrowth that in places\r\ngrew higher than a man’s head.\r\n\r\nAnd it was not the body of a jaguar or a puma that was pushing through\r\nthe thickets. Bomba was familiar enough with the habits of these\r\ncreatures to know that on a night like this they would remain closely\r\nsheltered in their caves. None of them would brave the fury of the\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nNor was it the odor of animals that was borne to him. Bomba’s long\r\nresidence in the jungle had developed his sense of smell so that it was\r\nalmost as keen as that of the jaguar itself. His nostrils dilated now\r\nas he sniffed the air and caught the unmistakable scent of human kind.\r\n\r\nHe had thought that he had left his enemies behind. Now he knew that\r\nthey were also in front. It was from that direction that the scent had\r\ncome.\r\n\r\nIt was no small party with which he had to deal. Nascanora’s braves\r\nwere out in force. All Bomba’s subtlety and force would be needed that\r\nnight, if he were to keep his head on his shoulders. And Bomba valued\r\nthat head highly.\r\n\r\nHe went forward now more slowly, more cautiously, pausing to look about\r\nhim warily when the lightning illumined the jungle.\r\n\r\nAt one brilliant flash he dropped behind some bushes as though shot.\r\n\r\nNot more than a dozen yards away three Indians were creeping toward\r\nhim, spear points lowered, glinting evilly!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nAT GRIPS WITH THE ENEMY\r\n\r\n\r\nLike a flash Bomba leaped to his feet and plunged into the underbrush.\r\n\r\nHe was not a moment too soon! With a yell, the headhunters sprang\r\ntoward the spot where he had been but a moment before.\r\n\r\nHad Bomba been on a level plain, he could have laughed at his pursuers,\r\nfor none of them matched him in fleetness of foot. But when it came\r\nto forcing his way through the heavy brush, they could move almost as\r\nquickly as himself, and the noise he made would be a sure guide to his\r\npursuers.\r\n\r\nRealizing this, Bomba adopted new tactics. With the litheness of a deer\r\nhe rose in the air, and with a series of successive bounds rapidly\r\nincreased the distance between him and the enemy. He hurdled the bushes\r\nin great leaps while his heavier foes were forcing their way through\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAt times he came to places where long creepers depended from the trees,\r\nand in order to rest his legs he swung himself along by his arms from\r\none to the other with incredible celerity.\r\n\r\nBomba’s heart sang within him as the sounds of pursuit became fainter.\r\nBut just as he was beginning to feel that he had escaped the most\r\npressing danger a chorus of yells came from somewhere in front of him.\r\nThese were answered by savage shouts in the rear.\r\n\r\nTo go on would be to throw himself into the hands of his foes. To\r\nretreat would be equally dangerous.\r\n\r\nTurning to the nearest tree, Bomba shinned up it with the agility of a\r\nmonkey and sought refuge in the thick foliage that hid him from sight,\r\nwhile yet permitting him to see what might be going on below.\r\n\r\nWhat was in that tree he did not know. Perhaps a boa constrictor wound\r\nabout one of the branches. But he must take his chance between possible\r\ndeath there and the almost certain death that threatened him on the\r\nground beneath.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely ensconced himself, panting, in the fork of two great\r\nbranches before a dozen or more Indians were under his refuge,\r\njabbering with rage and disappointment. They had thought they had their\r\nprey encircled and that all they had to do was to close in upon it. Now\r\nit had vanished as though into thin air.\r\n\r\nWith their spears and machetes they viciously beat the brushwood to\r\nright and left, thrusting their weapons into every thicket, their anger\r\ngrowing as their efforts remained fruitless.\r\n\r\nAt last they paused and grouped themselves together for consultation.\r\nBomba’s eyes strained through the darkness, trying to ascertain their\r\nnumber. His ears sought also to get what they were saying. Had it not\r\nbeen for the noise of the tempest, he might have succeeded in this, for\r\nhe was familiar with most of the dialects of the jungle dwellers. But\r\nall he could hear was a low growl that conveyed to him no meaning.\r\n\r\nThen the sound of voices died away and the only noise was that of the\r\nstorm. The black mass of figures had dissolved. Bomba seemed to be\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nHad the headhunters passed on? Had they been warned perhaps of some\r\ndanger that menaced them as well as the fugitive?\r\n\r\nFor a moment the heart of the jungle lad leaped with hope. Then his\r\nsensitive ear caught a rustling that he knew was not occasioned by the\r\nwind.\r\n\r\nNo, they had not gone. Some, perhaps, but not all.\r\n\r\nA lightning flash more dazzling than any that had gone before rent\r\nthe darkness of the jungle, flooding it with weird, unearthly light.\r\nIn that flash Bomba caught sight of several Indians crouched in the\r\nvicinity of the tree.\r\n\r\nThere came a rending, splintering crash that nearly shattered his\r\neardrums, a detonation that seemed to shake the earth.\r\n\r\nA giant tree near by, struck to the heart by the bolt, toppled and\r\ncrashed toward the earth. The Indians yelled and tried to flee. A\r\nblood-curdling scream rang through the jungle as the tree trunk thudded\r\nto the ground.\r\n\r\nBomba sensed what had happened. There was only one meaning to that\r\nscream.\r\n\r\n“The storm does Bomba’s work better than he can do it himself,”\r\nmuttered the lad.\r\n\r\nIf he had had any doubt that death had occurred, another flash showed\r\nthat he had made no mistake. The great tree in falling had caught one\r\nof the Indians beneath it, crushing the life from his body instantly.\r\nThe other savages were not visible, and Bomba rightly guessed that they\r\nwould believe the spot to be under a curse and would shun it as they\r\nwould the plague.\r\n\r\n“They will not come back to-night,” reasoned the jungle lad, “and\r\nto-morrow will be too late, for Bomba will not be here.”\r\n\r\nWith Bomba, to think was to act. Reaching out, he clutched a handful\r\nof creepers and slid to the ground. He paused a moment to get his\r\ndirection and then vanished into the underbrush.\r\n\r\nThere was no sign of his foes, and Bomba blessed that lightning stroke\r\nthat had sent them in panic flight. Not for the next ten minutes did\r\nanything happen to give him alarm.\r\n\r\nThen, without warning, he was struck from behind and fell to the\r\nground. The sound of a guttural voice was in his ears and sinewy\r\nfingers wound themselves about his throat.\r\n\r\nWhile the jungle boy struggles desperately to loose that strangling\r\nhold, it may be well, for the benefit of those who have not read the\r\npreceding volumes of this series, to tell who Bomba was and what had\r\nbeen his adventures up to the time this story opens.\r\n\r\nBomba could never remember a time when he had not lived in the jungle.\r\nHis only companion and guardian was Cody Casson, an aged naturalist,\r\nwho had withdrawn from civilization and the life of white people to\r\nsettle in one of the remotest recesses of the Amazonian jungle. Whether\r\nhe was related to him, Bomba did not know and had never wondered. He\r\nwould not have known the meaning of relative. He only knew that he\r\nloved Casson and that Casson loved him, although the latter seldom\r\ndemonstrated any affection in words, spending days at a time in moody\r\nabstraction.\r\n\r\nThe old man’s state had grown worse after a certain memorable day when\r\nhe had fired a gun at an anaconda which was threatening to attack\r\nBomba and the weapon had burst in his hands. The reptile was wounded by\r\nthe flying missiles and retreated, but Casson had received a serious\r\ninjury to his head. Bomba nursed him back to some degree of physical\r\nhealth, but Casson from that time on was half-demented, and the care of\r\nproviding for the two had fallen on the lad’s shoulders.\r\n\r\nFor such youthful shoulders it was a heavy burden, but it helped to\r\ndevelop the lad into a wonder of strength and daring. Dangers of all\r\nkinds surrounded him, wild beasts and reptiles with which the jungle\r\nswarmed, and only quick wit and dauntless courage could preserve his\r\nlife. But necessity is a hard taskmaster, and under its spur Bomba\r\nlearned all the craft of the jungle. Keen of eye, swift of foot, supple\r\nof muscle, and strong of heart, he matched himself against his foes and\r\nso far had come out the victor. He was now about fourteen years old,\r\nbut few grown men had his strength and resources.\r\n\r\nOf the outside world he knew nothing. All his life was circumscribed by\r\nthe jungle. Casson had started to give him a smattering of learning,\r\nbut the explosion of the rifle had brought this to an abrupt stop.\r\n\r\nSo Bomba roamed the jungle like a young faun at the beginning of the\r\nworld. His face was as bronzed as that of an Indian from constant\r\nexposure to sun and storm. But there was undeniable proof in his\r\nfeatures, in his aquiline nose, his firm jaw, his brown hair and eyes,\r\nthat he was of white blood. He wore the native tunic, or mendiyeh, and\r\na puma skin was slung across his breast--that of Geluk the puma that\r\nhe had come across and killed when it was trying to slay the friendly\r\nparrots, Kiki and Woowoo. Beneath his bare arms and legs powerful\r\nmuscles glided and rippled. Homemade sandals encased his feet.\r\n\r\nHis weapons consisted of a bow and arrows, and he wore at his belt\r\na machete, or two-edged knife, fully a foot in length, a fearful\r\nblade when it came to hand-to-hand fighting. In addition he had a\r\nfive-chambered revolver, the only firearm of which he was possessed,\r\nand which had been given to him by two white rubber hunters after he\r\nhad rendered them a signal service.\r\n\r\nDespite its perils, he loved the life of the jungle, and but for\r\none thing would have been reasonably happy. That thing was the\r\nconsciousness of his white blood. It tugged at his heart, and while it\r\ngave him pride, it also tormented him. The call of the blood was strong\r\nwithin him. He knew that, somehow, he was out of place. Something was\r\nalways calling him to go elsewhere, beckoning him on to new horizons,\r\ntelling him that he belonged to the white people.\r\n\r\nHe had a great yearning to know of his parentage. He had not the\r\nslightest memory of his father or mother. Again and again he had\r\nquestioned Casson on this point, but the old man’s memory always failed\r\nhim at the very moment of revelation. In these efforts to recall the\r\npast Casson had frequently muttered the words “Bartow” and “Laura,” and\r\nBomba had inferred that the names were those of his father and mother.\r\nBut the further knowledge he craved was denied him.\r\n\r\nHow Bomba saved the camp of Gillis and Dorn, rubber hunters, from a\r\nnight attack by jaguars--how he trapped the deadly cooanaradi, the most\r\ndreaded serpent of the South American wilds, when it pursued him; his\r\nadventures with alligators and anacondas; the besieging of his cabin\r\nby the headhunters; how his friends of the forest came to his aid when\r\nhe was fearfully beset; all this is narrated in the first volumes of\r\nthis series, entitled: “Bomba, the Jungle Boy; or, The Old Naturalist’s\r\nSecret.”\r\n\r\nLater on, Casson told Bomba that, though he himself could not remember\r\nthe facts about the lad’s parentage, the latter could get that\r\ninformation from Jojasta, the medicine man of the Moving Mountain.\r\nBomba, therefore, after providing for Casson’s safety while he should\r\nbe gone, set out to see Jojasta. From the very outset his path was\r\nbeset with perils. Flood and earthquake, man and beast sought his life.\r\nHe was instrumental in delivering from the hands of the savages a Mrs.\r\nParkhurst and her son, Frank, and his association with the two deepened\r\nhis desire to know more of that white civilization with which they were\r\nso familiar. He was hurled into a subterranean cavern, escaped by a\r\nhair’s breadth and finally reached Jojasta and the Moving Mountain.\r\n\r\nThere disappointment awaited him; but he was told that if he could find\r\nSobrinini, the witch who dwelt near the Giant Cataract, she might give\r\nhim the knowledge for which his soul longed.\r\n\r\nBaffled for a time but not disheartened, Bomba resolved to search out\r\nSobrinini, though warned that great peril would attend the attempt.\r\nHow true that warning was he soon had reason to learn. He fell into\r\nthe power of Nascanora and was doomed by him to torture and death. How\r\nhis quick wit saved him; the terrible dangers to which his indomitable\r\nspirit refused to yield, and which he finally surmounted; how he found\r\nSobrinini at last on her island of snakes and brought her back with\r\nhim, only to be tantalized with imperfect revelations that made it\r\nstill necessary to hunt out Japazy on Jaguar Island is told in the\r\npreceding volume of this series, entitled, “Bomba, the Jungle Boy, at\r\nthe Giant Cataract; or, Chief Nascanora and His Captives.”\r\n\r\nAnd now to return to Bomba as he writhed and struggled to shake himself\r\nfree from that terrible grip on his throat!\r\n\r\nHe knew that he was fighting for his life.\r\n\r\nWhat was it that had waited for him with the stealth of the panther to\r\nleap upon him as he passed?\r\n\r\nThat one of the headhunters of the tribe of Nascanora had him in his\r\ngrip, Bomba knew at the first touch of those fingers of steel about his\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\nFew could break the grip of the jungle Indian. Only those bred as Bomba\r\nhad been among the very wild beasts of that tangled region could have\r\nhoped to free himself of that strangle hold.\r\n\r\nWith a tremendous heave of his powerful young shoulders Bomba flung\r\nhimself upon his back, the Indian half over him. With frantic fingers\r\nthe lad tore at that clutch about his throat.\r\n\r\nAbove, the thunder rumbled dourly. Dim flashes of sheet lightning\r\nserved to deepen by contrast the darkness that enveloped the\r\nantagonists.\r\n\r\nStrain as he would the lad could not force that hold to break. His\r\nhead was reeling, his brain confused and black spots danced before his\r\nglazing eyes.\r\n\r\nA flash of lightning brighter than the rest showed him the Indian, on\r\nwhose face was an expression of fiendish gloating.\r\n\r\nThat look was a spur to Bomba’s failing senses. He thought of Casson,\r\nleft defenseless with Bomba dead, and by a mighty effort raised himself\r\nand drove his knee with all his strength into the flesh beneath the\r\nribs of his antagonist.\r\n\r\nThe blow was a surprise to the Indian, who counted his adversary as\r\nalready beaten. He grunted with dismay and pain. For the fraction of an\r\ninstant his grip relaxed, and in that instant Bomba had burst the iron\r\nring about his throat and was on his feet.\r\n\r\nWith a bellow of rage the savage also sprang upright, whipping out a\r\nshort knife from his belt.\r\n\r\nBut quick as he was, Bomba was quicker. He saw the gleam of the\r\nIndian’s steel, drew his own machete and with one stroke sent his\r\nenemy’s weapon whizzing off into the underbrush.\r\n\r\nLike a panther, the Indian sprang upon the white boy, and before Bomba\r\ncould strike home with the machete had seized upon the lad’s hand,\r\nstriving to bend it backward and possess himself of the machete.\r\n\r\nBut if the Indian was strong, so was Bomba. He was fighting for two\r\nlives, his own and Casson’s, and, moreover, one of his fierce rages\r\nwas upon him; one of those wild bursts of fury that for the moment\r\ngave him the strength of the jaguar, the wile of the fox, the quickness\r\nof the snake.\r\n\r\nBomba was all these in one now, as he fought with the Indian, straining\r\nbackward and forward, resisting the pressure upon his knife arm,\r\nstriving with all the power in him to drive downward the shining point\r\nof his machete, to sink it to the hilt in his enemy’s flesh.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes the fierce struggle went on. Then, with a sudden\r\ntwist, Bomba broke the Indian’s hold, leaped backward several feet, and\r\nthrew his machete.\r\n\r\nIt would have found its mark had not the savage fallen forward with the\r\nsudden releasing of Bomba’s pressure. The knife grazed his head. Thrown\r\noff his balance, the savage tried to recover himself. But the slime of\r\nmud and leaves made treacherous footing and the Indian plunged headlong.\r\n\r\nBomba was upon him with the swiftness of a jaguar!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE BLAZING CABIN\r\n\r\n\r\nAt such close quarters Bomba could not use his bow, and he dared not\r\nfire the revolver lest it attract the attention of lurking foes.\r\n\r\nRising into the air, he came down with both feet on his enemy’s head.\r\nThen he stamped the head into the mud and ooze till the savage lay\r\nstill.\r\n\r\nWhether the man breathed or not, Bomba did not stop to inquire. It was\r\nenough that he had been put out of action. The noise of the struggle,\r\nmuffled as it had been, might already be drawing others to the scene.\r\nBomba must act swiftly, if he were to leave the spot alive.\r\n\r\nOne of his precious minutes he gave to the search for his machete. With\r\nits aid he might still win through to Casson at the hut of Pipina. By\r\na stroke of good fortune he found the weapon where it had stuck in the\r\ntrunk of a tree.\r\n\r\nWith a smothered cry of elation, Bomba leaped upon it and wrenched it\r\nfrom its hold. Again and again that knife had saved his life, and it\r\nmight do it again before the night was over.\r\n\r\nBomba’s body was bruised, he was dead tired, but his spirit was unhurt.\r\nThe thirst of battle was still in him. His blood was hot with it.\r\n\r\nTwice to-night he had outwitted his enemies. Nascanora and his\r\nhalf-brother Tocarora would again realize that he, Bomba, was as\r\nslippery as the cooanaradi and as deadly.\r\n\r\nHe wasted no time. He set his feet in the direction of the cabin of\r\nPipina, the squaw, and went stealthily yet swiftly through the jungle.\r\n\r\nThe storm had felled great trees across his path. Some of these he\r\nclimbed over, while he took the smaller ones with a leap. Where the\r\nground was impassable he swung himself along from creeper to creeper\r\nand branch to branch. No inhabitant of the jungle save the monkeys\r\nwere as skilled in this method of progress as Bomba, and he made his\r\nway with amazing celerity. Never had that accomplishment stood him in\r\nbetter stead.\r\n\r\nHis eyes and ears were alert for the slightest sight or sound that\r\nmight forebode danger. But this did not prevent his mind from being in\r\na tumult of varied emotions.\r\n\r\nHis most anxious thought was of Casson, Casson alone in the jungle hut\r\nsave for Pipina. Again the headhunters sought the life of Casson.\r\nAgain was Bomba hunted like the veriest wild beast.\r\n\r\nBitterness welled up in the heart of the lad against these savages,\r\nwhom he had never injured except in self-defense. Why was he doomed to\r\nspend his life among these people so alien to him?\r\n\r\nBomba was white. All his yearnings were toward those of his own race.\r\n\r\nWho were his parents? He thought of the picture of the beautiful woman\r\nthat had hung in the little back room of Sobrinini’s hut on the island\r\nof snakes. That face had stirred his heart as no other had ever done.\r\nWas the beautiful woman his mother?\r\n\r\nWho was he? What had happened to his parents and why had he become at\r\nso early an age the sole companion of old Cody Casson?\r\n\r\nHe reviewed the strange behavior of the half-mad old woman, Sobrinini,\r\nshe who had once been the operatic idol of Europe, she who had had\r\nkings at her feet. Why had she not finished the story of the man named\r\nBartow, his wife, Laura, and the child they called Bonny?\r\n\r\nSobrinini had called him, Bomba, by the name of Bartow. She had thought\r\nin her poor twisted mind that Bomba was Bartow. Was it possible that\r\nBomba was the boy who had once been called Bonny?\r\n\r\nBomba heaved a heavy sigh. Questions, questions always, and no answers.\r\nCody Casson had the key to the mystery. But poor Casson must first find\r\nthe key to that closed door in his mind beyond which he could not go.\r\n\r\nHis mind in a whirl of unrest and longing, Bomba at last reached the\r\nriver which he must cross to reach the hut of Pipina.\r\n\r\nThe storm had now entirely died away. Only the heavy dripping of\r\nmoisture from the foliage betrayed its recent passage. The jungle was\r\nstill again with an unearthly stillness. The slight swish made by Bomba\r\nas he swung himself from branch to branch was the only sound that broke\r\nthe silence.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he paused and hung motionless, arms and legs entwined about\r\na bunch of creepers. His quick ear had caught a sound other than the\r\ndripping of water on the sodden earth.\r\n\r\nIt was a slight sound, but Bomba knew at once what had caused it. It\r\nwas the faint dip of paddles in the water. The Indians were traveling\r\nupstream. The headhunters of Nascanora were on their way to the hut of\r\nPipina to spread terror and death. Fortunate if death were all! Far\r\nworse would be the tortures of any captives who might be carried off\r\nalive to make a holiday for the savages who had been left at home and\r\nwho would revel in the screams of their victims.\r\n\r\nBomba had been carrying his machete between his teeth. Now he dropped\r\nlightly to the ground, and, with the double-edged knife held firmly in\r\nhis grasp, ran swiftly toward the river.\r\n\r\nUpon the banks of the stream he paused, listening. Still the dip, dip\r\nof paddles coming upstream. So faint and stealthy was the sound that it\r\nwould have been inaudible to most ears other than those of Bomba.\r\n\r\nThe lad wasted not an instant, but slipped from the steep bank until he\r\nwas waist deep in the sluggish water. The dense foliage of the jungle\r\ntrees grew down to the very edge of the stream, flinging its rank\r\ngrowth out over the water.\r\n\r\nBomba had a canoe of his own concealed in the bushes some distance\r\nup the stream. Had there been time, he would have made for that, for\r\nhe well knew the danger of making the river crossing by fording or\r\nswimming. The deadly alligator, or cayman, infested all the waters of\r\nthe jungle, and any daring person that ventured to cross knew that he\r\nmight pay for the venture with his life.\r\n\r\nBut time was everything to Bomba now. The headhunters were more to be\r\nfeared than the cayman. The former were awake. The latter might be\r\nasleep. At all costs, he must make the venture. He must make haste, if\r\nhe were to save the life of Casson and that of Pipina.\r\n\r\nBomba had let himself go so gently into the water as scarcely to make\r\na ripple, and he moved on noiselessly, wading where he could, but soon\r\nreaching the deeper channel where he had to swim. Then most of the time\r\nhe swam under water lest his presence be declared to prying eyes. He\r\nwas almost as much at home in the water as on land, and only at long\r\nintervals had to come to the surface for air.\r\n\r\nBut swiftly as he swam, the Indians could paddle more swiftly. And a\r\nterrible fear gripped the lad’s heart as the sound of the paddles grew\r\never fainter in the distance.\r\n\r\nThey would reach the hut first. They would find it undefended and might\r\nattack at once. The worst might have happened before Bomba could reach\r\nthe only place he called home.\r\n\r\nWhat he would do when he got there he had not figured out. He would act\r\nas the occasion suggested. He would be but one against many; but he had\r\nbeen in that position more than once and yet won the victory.\r\n\r\nHe swam on swiftly until he was arrested by a sight that brought a\r\ngrowl of fury to his lips.\r\n\r\nTurning a bend in the river, a light assailed Bomba’s eyes, a fearful\r\nlight, a light such as the native of the jungle dreads above all\r\nothers. It was a dull glow, brightening now and then to a vivid red as\r\nthe flames swept skyward.\r\n\r\nBomba groaned and his teeth gritted against each other as he plunged\r\nmadly forward. For he knew all too well what had caused the glare. The\r\nhut of Pipina was ablaze!\r\n\r\nThis was the work of Nascanora’s bucks, their revenge upon a broken,\r\ndemented old man who had never harmed any one in his life!\r\n\r\nWas Casson in that blazing hut? Was poor Pipina, faithful friend,\r\ncaught in that flaming inferno?\r\n\r\nScarcely daring to put these questions to himself, Bomba swam madly\r\nupstream, his one thought now of revenge. He was consumed by rage. His\r\none desire was to feel the throat of Nascanora beneath his fingers.\r\n\r\nThe light was brighter now. The whole jungle was bathed in the fiendish\r\nglow.\r\n\r\nBomba turned toward the bank, but paused abruptly and trod water.\r\n\r\nBetween him and the shore, blocking his path, was a monster alligator!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTERRIBLE JAWS\r\n\r\n\r\nAt sight of the cayman, Bomba’s heart for a moment seemed to stop\r\nbeating.\r\n\r\nA wild hope that perhaps the brute was asleep and would not perceive\r\nhis presence was quickly dispelled as the lad caught sight of two\r\nfiery eyes fixed upon him. Then the huge mouth opened, displaying the\r\nhorrible array of teeth that, if they once closed on the lad, would\r\nbite him in half as easily as a pair of shears would snip a thread.\r\n\r\nDespairingly, Bomba felt for his machete. He knew that it would avail\r\nlittle except perhaps to wound. It would simply help him to die\r\nfighting.\r\n\r\nThen his heart leaped. His feet felt the river bed beneath them! He had\r\nreached the shallower part of the stream! Now he would have a footing,\r\nsomething that would give him a purchase and enable him to use his bow\r\nand arrows.\r\n\r\nQuick as lightning, he unslung the bow from his shoulder and drew an\r\narrow from its quiver. With one motion he fitted the arrow to the\r\nstring and let fly.\r\n\r\nThe light from the fire gave him what he needed for his aim, and the\r\narrow entered the eye of the monster and penetrated to the brain.\r\n\r\nWith a fearful bellow of rage and pain, the great brute leaped half out\r\nof the water and fell back, only to churn the water into a seething\r\nwhirlpool. In its wild flounderings the end of its serrated tail caught\r\nBomba on one of his legs and threw him farther out into the stream.\r\n\r\nBomba did not mind the blow, so full of exultation was he at the mortal\r\nwound he had inflicted on his enemy. But his elation changed to fear\r\nwhen he saw the scaly back of another alligator breaking the water. The\r\nbrute had been attracted by the uproar created by its stricken comrade\r\nand was coming swiftly.\r\n\r\nLuckily, the bank was not far away, and, putting all his power into his\r\nstrokes, the boy swam as he had never swum before. He reached the shore\r\nnot a moment too soon, for the hideous jaws snapped close behind him as\r\nhe pulled himself up the bank.\r\n\r\nThe impulse was strong on Bomba to shoot another arrow at the reptile\r\nand send it to join its companion. But arrows were precious now, and\r\nall he had would perhaps be needed for human foes.\r\n\r\nSo he repressed the impulse and hurried along the bank until he had\r\ncome near the fringe of trees that bordered the clearing in which\r\nstood the hut. He could not yet see the hut itself. But to reach it he\r\nwould have to make a dash across the clearing.\r\n\r\nIn the dark he could have eluded the eyes of his enemies, for no\r\nsnake could move more silently. But now the open space was flooded\r\nwith light. No figures were visible, but he knew that many eyes were\r\nwatching from the surrounding woods.\r\n\r\nStill he must chance it. He had faced death too often to let it daunt\r\nhim now.\r\n\r\nSummoning all his strength, he darted out into the open. His first few\r\nbounds carried him fifty feet. Then he dropped to the ground as a dozen\r\narrows whizzed over his head.\r\n\r\nIt was upon this that Bomba had counted. He had timed his drop for just\r\nthe instant that would allow the startled savages to aim and let fly.\r\n\r\nHe was up again on his feet, and before arrows could again be fitted to\r\nstrings had gained another fifty feet. Again he repeated his stratagem,\r\nbut this time not without scathe, for an arrow grazed his ankle.\r\n\r\n“The arrow may be poisoned,” he thought to himself, as he felt the\r\ntwinge of pain. “If it is, this is the end of Bomba.”\r\n\r\nHe reached the shelter of a tree and whirled behind it. On the side of\r\nthe clearing he had just left, one of the headhunters, keen after his\r\nprey, had come from behind his shelter.\r\n\r\nLike lightning, Bomba fitted an arrow to his string. There was a twang,\r\na hideous yell, and the savage threw up his hands and fell headlong.\r\n\r\n“There will be one less to fight Bomba,” muttered the lad. “They will\r\nfind that Bomba can shoot.”\r\n\r\nIf any had been inclined to follow the fallen Indian, they had\r\nhesitated when they had seen him drop, and Bomba had a moment’s\r\nbreathing space. He flew from behind the tree and, availing himself of\r\nwhat shelter he could find in his flight, came in sight of what had\r\nbeen his home.\r\n\r\nHis heart sank within him. The cabin was a mass of flames. It was\r\nimpossible for life to be sustained in that furnace for a minute. If\r\nCasson and Pipina had been trapped there, they were already far beyond\r\nhuman help. They must be just what the hut itself would be in a few\r\nminutes more, a heap of smoldering ashes.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Bomba forgot everything save the agony that clutched at\r\nhis heart. Then a sound brought him back to the danger that menaced him\r\npersonally.\r\n\r\nOut from the shelter of the trees, crouched almost double, their\r\nhorrible faces illumined by the lurid light of the flames, came a\r\nnumber of the headhunters.\r\n\r\nThey approached in a semicircle, cutting off Bomba’s retreat toward the\r\nfront and on either side. Back of him was the blazing hut, the heat\r\nfrom which was already scorching his face and hands.\r\n\r\nBomba felt that he was trapped. His doom seemed sealed. He felt for the\r\nhandle of the machete at his belt. He grasped his bow. He would not\r\nallow himself to be taken alive. Better instant death than the tortures\r\nof Nascanora. And he vowed that he would take more than one of his\r\nenemies with him.\r\n\r\nHe bent his bow, took quick aim and fired. A bronze-skinned buck\r\nclapped a hand to his breast, gave a frightful howl, and fell writhing\r\nin the dust.\r\n\r\nBut before Bomba could fit another arrow to his string there was a\r\nconcerted rush and a dozen hands reached out to seize him.\r\n\r\nBomba leaped back quickly and drew his machete. His eyes blazed, his\r\nmuscles tensed.\r\n\r\nThe Indians yelled and leaped forward.\r\n\r\nBang!\r\n\r\nA sharp detonation clashed against their eardrums like a crash of\r\nthunder. The force of the explosion shook the earth and flung the\r\nnatives to the ground.\r\n\r\nBomba found himself on his face, half-stunned, bewildered. Mysterious\r\nmissiles hurtled over his head, exploding in mid-air.\r\n\r\nHe raised himself cautiously to his knees and saw a sight that brought\r\nhope to his heart.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were in full retreat, and as they fled they looked over\r\ntheir shoulders at him fearfully, as though they blamed him for their\r\ndiscomfiture.\r\n\r\nBomba well knew the mind of the Indian. The cause of the explosion and\r\nthe trembling of the earth were unknown to them. So they reasoned that\r\nit must be a spell thrown over them by Bomba, friend of the old witch\r\ndoctor, Casson, to destroy them and save himself.\r\n\r\nThe Indians stopped in their mad flight at the edge of the jungle and\r\nlooked back. One of them, more daring than the rest, raised his bow and\r\ntook aim.\r\n\r\nBut before he could release the string one of the flying missiles\r\nstruck the would-be slayer, hurling him to the ground.\r\n\r\nThis was too much. The savages turned terror-stricken and fled from\r\nthat scene of mysterious death.\r\n\r\nBy this time Bomba had realized what must have caused the explosion.\r\nTheir little store of powder, so carefully guarded by Casson and\r\nhimself, had gone off when reached by the hot breath of the fire. The\r\nflying missiles were the last of the cartridges belonging to his\r\nrevolver, that wonderful gift of Gillis and Dorn, the white rubber\r\nhunters.\r\n\r\nBruised and shaken, Bomba staggered to his feet, hardly able to believe\r\nhis good fortune.\r\n\r\nBut as he turned back toward the cabin a great wave of desolation\r\nflooded his heart.\r\n\r\nThere lay the cabin, now a heap of ashes. Were the ashes of Casson and\r\nPipina also there? Had those faithful ones come there to their death?\r\n\r\nWith a sob Bomba threw himself on the ground and abandoned himself to\r\nuncontrolled grief.\r\n\r\nThis, however, was of short duration. A wild rage welled up in his\r\nheart, rage against the wicked Nascanora and his cruel tribe.\r\n\r\n“They shall pay!” the lad cried, leaping to his feet. “For every drop\r\nof Casson’s blood they shall pay! There will yet be wailing in the huts\r\nof Nascanora. It is I, Bomba, who swear it!”\r\n\r\nHe paused, head upflung, listening.\r\n\r\nWhat was that sound?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nHOW THE INDIANS CAME\r\n\r\n\r\nBomba strained his ears and again heard the thing that had startled\r\nhim. It was a faint cry, rising and falling like a wail somewhere in\r\nthe bushes.\r\n\r\n“Help!” came the voice, eerie as that of a banshee in the darkness.\r\n“Help, Bomba! Help!”\r\n\r\nInto Bomba’s heart sprang a great joy. This was the voice of Pipina,\r\nthe squaw--the voice that he had never expected to hear again. And\r\nwhere Pipina was, must be Casson!\r\n\r\nHe was off like a deer in the direction from which the cry had come.\r\n\r\n“Bomba hears you,” he called softly. “Bomba is coming.”\r\n\r\n“Help!” came the feeble voice again. “Pipina is caught and cannot get\r\nloose. Come quickly.”\r\n\r\nBomba wondered why he did not hear Casson’s voice, if Casson still\r\nlived. But he said nothing and hurried on, hacking a passage through\r\nthe undergrowth.\r\n\r\nHe came nearer and nearer to the wailing woman until, pushing aside a\r\ntangle of vines, he saw her. The moon, following close on the heels of\r\nthe tropical storm, was now riding high in the heavens and shedding a\r\nsoft luster over the jungle. By its light, Bomba caught sight of Pipina\r\nas she stood holding out helpless hands to him.\r\n\r\nShe had been caught in a thorn thicket that had cruelly scratched her\r\nhands and arms as she had struggled to free herself. Her wrinkled face\r\nwas drawn with pain.\r\n\r\nBy the deft use of his machete Bomba cleared away the clutching\r\nbranches and released her. The old squaw staggered dizzily, and the lad\r\nput this arms about her shoulders to support her.\r\n\r\n“Casson!” muttered Bomba hoarsely. “Tell me, Pipina! Tell me quick!\r\nWhere is Casson?”\r\n\r\nThe old woman drooped her head and stood there like a bowed statue of\r\ngrief, but said nothing until Bomba, mad with anxiety, shook her gently\r\nby the shoulders.\r\n\r\n“Do you hear, Pipina? Where is the good white man, Cody Casson, my\r\nfriend?”\r\n\r\nThen the old woman raised her hands above her head and gave vent to a\r\nwailing, desolate cry.\r\n\r\n“Pipina no can tell. Casson her friend, too, good friend. He is gone.”\r\n\r\nBomba’s face darkened and again his heart contracted under the cold\r\nhand of anguish.\r\n\r\n“Tell me, Pipina,” he commanded. “Where has he gone? What has become of\r\nhim?”\r\n\r\n“We sit down and I will tell you,” returned the squaw. “Pipina weak,\r\nsick--”\r\n\r\nFor answer, Bomba cleared a space and, taking the old woman, placed her\r\nas comfortably as he could with her back resting against a giant tree.\r\n\r\nHe sat down opposite her, his arms folded, his glance full upon her\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“Now, Pipina, tell Bomba all,” he urged.\r\n\r\nThe old woman looked about her and shuddered. She wrapped her skinny\r\narms about her as though they were a garment and had power to ward off\r\nthe chill of the night.\r\n\r\n“Headhunters--they gone?” she asked fearfully.\r\n\r\n“Gone,” said Bomba tersely. “Where is Casson?”\r\n\r\n“Bomba make them go away all by himself,” continued the squaw\r\nadmiringly. “Bomba great man some day--”\r\n\r\nBomba bent toward her.\r\n\r\n“Do not talk foolishly, Pipina. Bomba not care about himself. Pipina\r\ntell about Casson.”\r\n\r\nThe old woman gave her wailing cry and rocked herself back and forth\r\ndrearily.\r\n\r\n“We have bad time, Casson, Pipina,” she said. “We all alone in hut,\r\nwishing Bomba come. Storm come, but not Bomba. Thunder like roar of\r\npumas, many pumas.”\r\n\r\n“Bomba caught in storm,” explained the lad. “No could come till storm\r\nstopped.”\r\n\r\n“Pipina listen for sound of Bomba’s feet,” went on the squaw. “Pipina\r\nafraid. She think danger near. Wish Bomba would come quick.”\r\n\r\nShe said this, leaning forward, in a quick, hissing whisper. Now she\r\nrelaxed against the tree and stared gloomily into the heavy shadows of\r\nthe jungle.\r\n\r\n“Casson not too good,” she muttered. “Pipina worry about Casson. Worry\r\nhard.”\r\n\r\n“What was wrong with Casson?” cried Bomba, exasperated beyond measure\r\nby the slowness with which Pipina got on with her story.\r\n\r\n“He very sick,” returned the squaw. “He not right.” She touched her\r\nforehead significantly. “He walk back and forth, back and forth, and\r\ntalk to himself. He say: ‘Laura, Laura, dear sweet Laura. Must tell\r\nBomba. Bartow and Laura and little boy--’”\r\n\r\nBomba caught the arm of the old woman in an eager grip.\r\n\r\n“Go on,” he commended. “What else did Casson say? Tell Bomba.”\r\n\r\nBut Pipina shook her head.\r\n\r\n“He not say more,” she said. “Only those words he say again and again.\r\nThen he stop, listen at door of hut, listen and then walk up and down,\r\nup and down.”\r\n\r\n“Go on,” cried Bomba.\r\n\r\n“Then we hear things. We think you come. We happy. We sing. We dance.\r\nBut no, Bomba not come. It is the headhunters that come to try to kill\r\nCasson and Pipina--”\r\n\r\nBomba gave a low growl like that of an animal and ground his teeth\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n“They come.” The voice of the old woman rose again in eerie wailing.\r\n“Casson, Pipina, we close door, push bolt, as Bomba tell us. We heap\r\nthings against door. Casson he take down old gun, but it not work.\r\nHe put fire stick through hole in hut. He think frighten bucks of\r\nNascanora.”\r\n\r\nBomba groaned as he saw the picture of old Cody Casson, brave to the\r\nlast, defying death, his only weapon a “fire stick” that would not work.\r\n\r\n“It happen quick,” went on Pipina with a helpless shake of her head.\r\n“One, two, three--like that,” with a snap of her bony fingers. “The\r\nheadhunters come. They have heads, fresh heads, women, children heads,\r\non string at waists. They want more heads, Casson’s head, Pipina’s\r\nhead. They beat on door. They say: ‘Open. No hurt. Nascanora friend of\r\nCasson.’”\r\n\r\nAgain came that growl as of an angry jaguar from the clenched teeth of\r\nBomba.\r\n\r\n“Forked tongues! Black hearts!” he snarled. The woman nodded.\r\n\r\n“Casson no open door,” she resumed. “He know Nascanora. He say things.\r\nMake big chief mad. He beat more hard on door. He shout: ‘Casson witch\r\ndoctor. He put a spell on sick people of our tribe. Nascanora burn\r\nCasson and hut of Casson with him.’”\r\n\r\nA smoldering fire was in Bomba’s eyes that boded no good to the chief\r\nof the headhunters.\r\n\r\n“Then Nascanora bring fire to the hut of Pipina,” went on the squaw.\r\n“His bucks come with heaps of vines and leaves. They wet and not burn\r\nat first. But after they burn, burn hot, and the hut of Pipina begin to\r\nburn too.”\r\n\r\n“But you got away, Pipina!” burst in Bomba eagerly. “You got away from\r\nthe headhunters and the fire. That was good. But how did you do it?\r\nTell Bomba. Do not make much words.”\r\n\r\nThe old woman shrugged her shoulders and there was a touch of pride in\r\nher tone as she replied:\r\n\r\n“Beneath the hut of Pipina there is a hole, and this hole it lead under\r\nthe ground out into the jungle.”\r\n\r\nBomba stared at her.\r\n\r\n“A hole!” he exclaimed. “A passage! Why you not tell Bomba?”\r\n\r\nThe squaw smiled inscrutably.\r\n\r\n“None know but Pipina.”\r\n\r\nBomba was listening with the most intense interest and wonder.\r\n\r\n“Go on,” he cried, as Pipina paused.\r\n\r\n“Pipina take up board in floor of hut,” went on the old woman. “Then\r\nget down and crawl through hole. Casson come too. Long time to creep\r\nthrough hole. Then come to end. Out into jungle where wet and cool.”\r\n\r\n“Then Casson got out safely?” cried Bomba.\r\n\r\nThe squaw nodded, and Bomba gratefully took her old wrinkled hand in\r\nhis.\r\n\r\n“Pipina has saved the life of Casson,” the lad said gravely. “For this\r\nBomba thanks Pipina. He will never forget.”\r\n\r\nThe old woman threw her hands above her head, rocking herself back and\r\nforth.\r\n\r\n“Ayah, ayah!” she wailed. “Pipina save the life of Casson, but she lose\r\nhim after. For when Pipina look around Casson is gone!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHROUGH THE JUNGLE\r\n\r\n\r\nA pang like the stab of a knife went through Bomba.\r\n\r\n“What mean you, Pipina?” he cried. “Speak. Speak fast.”\r\n\r\n“We stand up from hole,” the squaw explained. “We find us far in the\r\njungle away from the headhunters of Nascanora. Yet Casson and Pipina\r\nstill afraid.”\r\n\r\n“You hide?” asked Bomba.\r\n\r\nThe old woman nodded, looking about her fearfully.\r\n\r\n“We go far, very far, into the jungle,” she said. “We hide behind big\r\nrock. From there we see light from fire. Nascanora he think we are in\r\nhut. He think Casson and Pipina burn like tapir meat on the end of\r\nspit. But Pipina too smart for him. Pipina she fool the great chief\r\nNascanora.”\r\n\r\nHer words ended in a chuckle. There was something so ghastly in mirth\r\nat a scene that had so many elements of tragedy that Bomba felt the\r\nhair rise on his scalp, and he spoke sharply to Pipina.\r\n\r\n“You have not told Bomba what happened to Casson. Do not laugh and say\r\nfoolish words. Speak wise words and few words. Tell Bomba of Casson.”\r\n\r\n“Ayah!” wailed the squaw. “I look to see the clearing, the cabin. I\r\nlook hard. I look long. Pipina’s eyes were turned from Casson. Then I\r\nturn and see him. Then Pipina look again at cabin only as long as for a\r\nmonkey to swing from tree to tree. Yet when Pipina turn again--Casson\r\nis gone.”\r\n\r\n“Gone!”\r\n\r\nBomba sprang wildly to his feet and looked about him.\r\n\r\n“You do not know what way he went?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“No, Pipina does not know,” came sadly. “He was gone, and Pipina did\r\nnot dare go from behind the rock for fear she be caught by the bucks of\r\nNascanora.”\r\n\r\n“But why should Casson wander off?” asked Bomba, in bewilderment. “He\r\nwas safer behind the rock in the company of Pipina.”\r\n\r\nThe old woman sighed and touched her forehead again with her scrawny\r\nfinger.\r\n\r\n“He not right here,” she reminded him. “He not know what he do. Maybe\r\nhe go to find Bomba.”\r\n\r\n“He cannot find his way anywhere,” declared Bomba sadly. “He will be\r\nlike a child in the jungle. He will be at the mercy of the big cats, of\r\nthe anacondas, of the other creeping things that watch and spring upon\r\ntheir prey. Casson might as well have stayed in the hut of fire, for\r\nhis death in the jungle is as sure.”\r\n\r\nPipina wrung her hands and continued the rocking motion of her body.\r\n\r\n“He is mad,” she chanted in a singsong voice. “There is a strange power\r\nabout him that will keep off evil. The gods will watch over him. The\r\nserpent will not strike him, the jaguar will not spring upon him. For\r\nthey know that he is mad and fear him.”\r\n\r\nThough Bomba shook his head, the words of Pipina brought a little\r\ncomfort to his heart. He knew that the savage beasts of the jungle,\r\nlike the savage men of the jungle, had fear of all that was not sane\r\nand shunned it. Still, poor Cody Casson’s feebleness of mind seemed but\r\na doubtful protection, and Bomba’s heart misgave him.\r\n\r\n“When Pipina found that Casson was gone what did she do then?” he\r\nasked, turning to his companion.\r\n\r\n“Pipina wait till fire go out and she think Indians go away,” was the\r\nreply. “Then she creep back toward the cabin. She hope Bomba come back\r\nand help her find Casson. Then the thorns catch Pipina and she stop.\r\nShe call. Bomba come.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, Bomba came--too late,” said the lad sorrowfully. “My heart is\r\nheavy for Casson. Except Pipina, Bomba has no other friend.”\r\n\r\n“There is the good chief, Hondura,” suggested Pipina. “He will help\r\nBomba.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, he will help,” assented Bomba wearily. “Bomba will take Pipina to\r\nhim where she may rest in the maloca of the good chief. There she will\r\nbe safe from the headhunters of Nascanora. Then Bomba will find Casson.”\r\n\r\nBut though Bomba spoke with courage, grief possessed him. In his heart\r\nhe feared that certain death awaited the ill and feeble Casson in the\r\njungle.\r\n\r\nWith a sigh, Bomba turned to Pipina and held out his hand to her.\r\n\r\n“Come,” he said. “Bomba and Pipina will go to the camp of Hondura. It\r\nis not safe to stay here longer.”\r\n\r\nThe old woman shivered and protested.\r\n\r\n“It is dark,” she complained. “Wait till the sun rises in the sky and\r\nwe shall go more quickly to the camp of the good chief Hondura.”\r\n\r\n“In this place there is danger,” returned Bomba, in a low voice,\r\nlooking uneasily about him. “Even now the scouts of Nascanora may have\r\nreturned to search the ashes of the cabin to make sure that Casson and\r\nPipina are dead. Besides, they know that Bomba lives, and they will not\r\nsleep well at night until they know that he, too, is dead. Give Bomba\r\nyour hand, Pipina. We must go.”\r\n\r\nPipina obeyed without further protest. But she was trembling with\r\nage and the damp chill of the jungle night, and Bomba saw that their\r\nprogress to the camp of Hondura and his people must be slow.\r\n\r\n“Bomba will carry Pipina when the road is too rough,” promised the lad.\r\n“But by the time the sun rises in the sky we must reach the maloca of\r\nHondura or we are lost.”\r\n\r\nThe old woman hobbled on beside him, whimpering.\r\n\r\n“Bomba fears nothing, but Pipina is afraid,” she wailed. “There are\r\nevil spirits abroad in the night. They will carry us off and bury us in\r\nthe ygapo or feed us to the hungry jaguars.”\r\n\r\n“That would be better than to have the hands of Nascanora and his bucks\r\nfall upon us,” replied Bomba grimly. “Besides, Pipina speaks words that\r\nare foolish. There are no evil spirits in the darkness. The night is\r\nkind, for it hides our going from our enemies.”\r\n\r\nBomba spoke in a very low tone, scarcely above a whisper. But Pipina\r\ninterrupted him, holding up her hand.\r\n\r\n“Listen!” she said. “What was that?”\r\n\r\nFor answer Bomba seized her by the shoulders and dragged her down\r\nbeside him. Surrounded by the thick brush, they were well concealed\r\nfrom any one who did not pass too close. There was always a chance of\r\nbeing stumbled upon. But in that event Bomba’s knife would flash with\r\nthe quickness of the rattlesnake’s spring, and its sting would be quite\r\nas deadly.\r\n\r\nBomba listened, muscles tensed, every sense alert. Neither he nor\r\nPipina had been mistaken. They had heard a sound, the sharp crackling\r\nof a twig beneath a stealthy foot.\r\n\r\nThey heard no more for several seconds. Then, not twenty feet from\r\nthem, the brushwood stirred, and from it they saw two figures emerge\r\nand stand faintly outlined against the darker shadows of the jungle.\r\n\r\nBomba’s first thought was that perhaps the sound he heard had been\r\ncaused by Casson. His heart leaped with hope and gladness. But that\r\nfeeling was quickly dispelled when he recognized two of the headhunters\r\nof Nascanora.\r\n\r\nThey stood there conversing in a dialect which Bomba readily\r\nunderstood, as he did most other languages of the region.\r\n\r\n“They are dead,” said one of them. “The fire has made ashes of their\r\nbones. The white witch doctor will no longer lay his spells on the\r\npeople of the Giant Cataract.”\r\n\r\nBomba rejoiced. They had not then found Casson.\r\n\r\n“It is good,” returned the other. “The squaws and the old men of the\r\ntribe will be glad when we tell them that the man who made bad magic is\r\ndead.”\r\n\r\n“But the boy still lives,” returned the other. “Nascanora will not\r\nsleep well until he has his head upon his wigwam. Already this night\r\nthe boy has beaten Toluro in fight. He stamped his head into the mud.\r\nAnd his arrows have carried death on their points.”\r\n\r\n“The demons help him,” the other replied. “They come from the fire and\r\nstrike down our men. He has the same magic as the old man with white\r\nhair. He is wiser and stronger than our medicine men.”\r\n\r\nA few more words, and the Indians passed on, their going scarcely\r\ndisturbing a leaf or a twig.\r\n\r\n“They pass like the shadows of all things evil,” murmured Bomba to\r\nhimself, as he cautiously rose again to his feet and prepared to resume\r\nhis journey. “Come, Pipina.”\r\n\r\nThey made fairly good progress, considering Pipina’s age and weakness.\r\nThere was no pausing to take their bearings, for Bomba was familiar\r\nwith the way that led to Hondura’s village.\r\n\r\nWhen the strength of the old squaw failed and she could go no farther,\r\nBomba picked her up in his strong young arms and carried her with\r\nscarcely a lessening of his stride.\r\n\r\nAfter a while they heard the sound of rushing water.\r\n\r\nBomba lowered Pipina to the ground and stood listening.\r\n\r\n“The storm has filled the ygapo,” he murmured. “It will be hard\r\ncrossing. Listen, Pipina.”\r\n\r\n“I hear,” wailed the squaw. “Bomba cannot ford the ygapo. He must swim,\r\nand that will be hard with an old woman on his back. Pipina cannot\r\nswim.”\r\n\r\n“There will be caymans in the ygapo,” muttered Bomba thoughtfully.\r\n“Bomba cannot swim with Pipina and fight at the same time. Yet we must\r\ncross the ygapo if we are to be in the camp of the good chief before\r\nthe sun comes up.”\r\n\r\n“Pipina cannot cross,” whimpered the old woman. “She will be killed and\r\nBomba too will be killed. Wait here till the darkness goes, and we will\r\ncross by the light of the sun. Bomba can make a raft and we will go on\r\nthat.”\r\n\r\n“Our enemies are about us,” returned Bomba, as he bent a frowning look\r\nupon the surrounding forest. “If we wait, they will find us and drag\r\nus to the village of Nascanora. We cannot wait. We must go.”\r\n\r\n“The river roars,” wailed the squaw, wringing her hands. “It waits for\r\nBomba and Pipina like a jaguar hungry for its meat. It is death to\r\ncross.”\r\n\r\n“A little way from here there is a log across the water,” said Bomba.\r\n“What better bridge do Bomba and Pipina want?”\r\n\r\n“The log is slippery,” moaned Pipina. “Bomba must go on. His feet are\r\nsure. But he cannot carry Pipina. He will fall. Bomba go alone. Leave\r\nPipina behind.”\r\n\r\nIgnoring the woman’s protests, Bomba caught her in his arms and bore\r\nher swiftly along the banks of the stream.\r\n\r\nHe came to the log that stretched from bank to bank of the ygapo, or\r\nswamp. At this point it had narrowed to the proportions of a moderately\r\nwide gully. Usually there was only a muddy ooze at its bottom.\r\n\r\nBut now the tropical rains had filled the gully, and a raging torrent\r\nroared between the banks.\r\n\r\nBomba’s bridge would have been but a poor one at the best of times--a\r\ntree trunk cut down close to the bank in such a way as to fall across\r\nthe gulch.\r\n\r\nEven in the light of day, to cross its moss-grown, treacherous surface\r\nwithout slipping was no easy matter. Yet Bomba had done it again and\r\nagain, for he was as lithe and sure-footed as a mountain goat.\r\n\r\nBut this was a different matter, and Bomba was well aware of the danger\r\nthat he faced. The dashing spray had made the log almost as slippery\r\nas glass. The darkness added to the peril. With Pipina in his arms it\r\nwould be difficult to retain his balance. One slip and the two might\r\ngo whirling into that seething torrent to a fate that the boy scarcely\r\ndared to think about.\r\n\r\nStill the jungle lad did not hesitate. In front was the torrent, behind\r\nhim the headhunters. He chose what he regarded as the lesser of the two\r\nevils, relying upon his strength and his sureness of foot to carry him\r\nand his burden to the opposite side.\r\n\r\nHe shut his ears to the menacing roar of the waters. He had defied the\r\nfury of torrents before. He would defy it again.\r\n\r\nResolutely Bomba set foot upon the log.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nA PERILOUS CROSSING\r\n\r\n\r\nBeneath him the waters roared and thundered. Pipina whimpered and\r\nbesought her gods, but the ears of Bomba were deaf to her cries.\r\n\r\nUnderfoot the trunk was like glass. The slightest misstep might mean\r\ndisaster. But Bomba advanced steadily, scarcely troubled by the light\r\nweight of the squaw. He was so accustomed to the dark that he hardly\r\nneeded the faint rays of moonlight that filtered through the trees to\r\ntell him where to place his feet.\r\n\r\nHe was half-way across. Now he was more than half. Before him loomed\r\nthe dense undergrowth of the farther bank. Suddenly his foot slipped!\r\n\r\nFor one horrible moment Bomba teetered over eternity.\r\n\r\nPipina sent up a shrill cry, for she expected that moment to be her\r\nlast.\r\n\r\nBy a marvelous exercise of muscular control, Bomba balanced himself and\r\nretained his foothold upon the log with one foot while he drew up the\r\nother and gradually regained his equilibrium.\r\n\r\nBut Pipina, in panic, was now squirming about in his arms and\r\ndisarranging his calculations. He measured the distance still to be\r\ntraversed, staked his all on one swift run, sped across the treacherous\r\nlog, and with one last leap reached the farther shore in safety.\r\n\r\nA great joy was singing in his heart as he set Pipina on her feet.\r\n\r\n“The gods are with us, Pipina!” he exulted. “Where are your bad spirits\r\nnow? Tell Bomba that!”\r\n\r\n“We have not yet reached the maloca of Hondura,” the old squaw reminded\r\nhim, holding tenaciously to her superstition. “It is not well to\r\nrejoice too soon. We may yet find evil spirits hiding, waiting for us\r\nbehind the trees.”\r\n\r\nBut Bomba laughed such fears to scorn. He was buoyant with confidence.\r\nFate had been kind to him thus far that night, fate and his own quick\r\nbrain and strong arms.\r\n\r\nHis knowledge of the savages and their ways told him that he and Pipina\r\nhad passed through the ring of the headhunters. Moreover, the maloca of\r\nHondura was now only two hours’ journey away and through a less tangled\r\npart of the jungle.\r\n\r\nTrue, there was not a moment that did not hold possible peril for\r\nthem. A boa constrictor might dart from a tree branch and seek to\r\nencircle them in its folds. The roar of a jaguar might prelude its\r\nspring. Every thicket might harbor a bringer of death.\r\n\r\nBut evil as they were, they were better understood and more easily\r\ndealt with than those human enemies, the men who carried at their belts\r\nthe heads of their victims.\r\n\r\nPipina declared now that she was strong enough to walk, and they made\r\nrapid progress through the jungle, and as the first faint heralds of\r\nthe dawn appeared in the eastern sky they came within sight of the\r\nmaloca, or village, of Hondura, chief of the Araos tribe, the strongest\r\nin that section of the jungle.\r\n\r\nWhen Bomba and his companion reached the outskirts of the native\r\nvillage they found the inhabitants already astir. The wanderers were\r\nchallenged by scouts, for since the advent of the headhunters a strict\r\nwatch was kept day and night. But the jungle lad was well known and\r\nliked by the members of the tribe. His popularity with them was only\r\nsecond to that of the chief himself, for only a few months before,\r\nBomba had rendered the tribe a service that made him forever secure in\r\ntheir affections.\r\n\r\nSo Bomba and Pipina were greeted with every manifestation of delight by\r\nthe sentries and brought in triumph into the presence of the chief.\r\n\r\nThe little Pirah, the greatly loved daughter of the chief, was with her\r\nfather, coaxing and cajoling him as usual for some childish privilege.\r\nShe gave a squeal of rapture as she saw Bomba and ran to him, flinging\r\nher arms about his neck.\r\n\r\n“Bomba has come back to us!” she cried, in delight. “Bomba will stay.\r\nThat make Pirah glad. Pirah very happy.”\r\n\r\nHondura had been watching the meeting with a smile upon his\r\nwizened face. Now he came forward, and his greeting, though not so\r\ndemonstrative, was quite as cordial.\r\n\r\n“It is good that Bomba is here,” he said. “Bomba has not come for many\r\nmoons. Hondura is glad. He will make a feast for Bomba and all the\r\ntribe will rejoice.”\r\n\r\n“Hondura has a good heart,” returned the lad. “He speaks good words and\r\nhis tongue is not forked. Bomba has come to ask Hondura to help him. He\r\nwants to leave Pipina with him where she will be safe while he goes on\r\na journey that may take him many moons.”\r\n\r\n“Pipina is welcome in the maloca of Hondura,” replied the chief, as he\r\nturned a kindly look on the old woman, who bowed her head and stood in\r\nmeek humility before him. “Pipina can stay with the women because she\r\nis a friend of Bomba, who is a good friend to the tribe of Hondura.”\r\n\r\nThe chief motioned them to seat themselves upon the cushions of rushes\r\nwithin his tepee, and presently food was brought to them which they\r\ndevoured eagerly, for they had not eaten since noon of the day before.\r\n\r\nWhile they ate, Hondura questioned them further, while Pirah sat close\r\nto the jungle lad, every now and then reaching out a timid little hand\r\nto touch him.\r\n\r\n“Where is the good white man, Casson?” asked Hondura.\r\n\r\nBomba shook his head sorrowfully.\r\n\r\n“Casson has gone away,” he replied. “He has wandered into the jungle.\r\nThe headhunters came last night and burned the cabin of Pipina. Bomba\r\nwas not there. But when he came he found Pipina hiding. She did not\r\nknow where Casson had gone.”\r\n\r\nFire flashed in Hondura’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“May the curse of the gods rest on Nascanora,” he cried. “Bomba should\r\nhave killed him the night he had him at his mercy.”\r\n\r\nThe reference was to a happening that had taken place near the Giant\r\nCataract on a night that Bomba had met Nascanora in the midst of a\r\nperilous and horrifying scene. As the chief had blocked his path Bomba\r\nhad sunk the iron hilt of his machete into Nascanora’s face, knocking\r\nhim senseless. Hondura had urged then that Bomba slay Nascanora, but\r\nthe boy had refused to kill an enemy who could not fight.\r\n\r\n“The point of your knife should have bit into his heart,” went on\r\nHondura. “Then he would have troubled you no more. Now he hates you\r\nmore than before and has sworn to have vengeance. His nose is crushed,\r\nand the squaws laugh at him behind his back, though they do not dare to\r\nsmile where he can see them. He would die happy if he could make Bomba\r\ndie first.”\r\n\r\nBomba laughed.\r\n\r\n“He has yet to catch Bomba,” he replied. “And if he does catch him, he\r\nmay wish that he had rather laid his hand upon a cooanaradi. I do not\r\nfear Nascanora. But I fear for Casson.”\r\n\r\n“Hondura is sorry that the good old white man has gone,” said the chief\r\ngravely. “Hondura like Casson. All the Araos like him. Wish him good.”\r\n\r\n“The good spirits will be with him in the jungle,” put in little Pirah.\r\n“They will bring him safely to Bomba again or to one of the bucks of my\r\nfather.”\r\n\r\nHondura smiled indulgently upon the child and put a hand upon the dark\r\nhair.\r\n\r\n“Pirah speaks well,” he remarked. “May the good spirits be with Casson\r\nduring his journeyings in the jungle.”\r\n\r\nBomba thanked them both from his heart and addressed himself to the\r\nchief.\r\n\r\n“If the good chief meets the white man, Casson, will he bring him to\r\nhis maloca and keep him safe until Bomba comes back?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“That Hondura will do,” promised the chief gravely.\r\n\r\nFor a few moments there was silence, while each stared thoughtfully\r\ninto the jungle. Then Hondura asked:\r\n\r\n“Where does Bomba go now that he speaks of leaving the maloca of\r\nHondura?”\r\n\r\n“I shall not leave yet, Hondura,” he replied. “First, I shall search\r\nfor Casson. I will beat every thicket of the jungle until I find him or\r\nfeel sure that the gods have taken him. Only after that is done will\r\nBomba set out on a long journey.”\r\n\r\n“The words are dark yet,” replied the chief. “Where is Bomba going?”\r\n\r\n“Bomba still seeks his parents,” returned the lad. “He wants to know\r\nabout his father and his mother. Even the jaguar’s cubs know their\r\nfather and mother. Bomba does not know. His heart will be heavy till\r\nhe does know. He has tried to learn the truth for many moons. He\r\nhas gone to the land of the Giant Cataract. He has traveled to the\r\nMoving Mountain. He has gone to the snake island of Sobrinini. He has\r\njourneyed many miles and met many dangers, and he does not yet know\r\nthe truth.”\r\n\r\n“Where does Bomba go now to find the truth?” asked the chief, his eyes\r\ndwelling thoughtfully on the lad.\r\n\r\n“I go to seek Japazy, the half-breed,” replied Bomba. “Japazy may tell\r\nBomba what he wishes to know. Jojasta is gone. Sobrinini is gone.\r\nCasson is gone. Japazy is the one hope of Bomba. If Japazy is dead--”\r\n\r\nHe did not finish the sentence, but with a shrug of his shoulder stared\r\ngloomily before him.\r\n\r\nThere was an interval of silence, and when the chief spoke again it was\r\nin a low and solemn tone.\r\n\r\n“Where is it,” he asked, “that Bomba would seek for Japazy, the\r\nhalf-breed?”\r\n\r\nBomba hesitated for a moment, then spoke:\r\n\r\n“I go to a spot where it is said I may find Japazy. I go to Jaguar\r\nIsland.”\r\n\r\nThe stoic calm of the Indian vanished. A look of horror sprang into his\r\neyes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE WARNING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief of the Araos leaned toward Bomba and spoke in a voice charged\r\nwith intensity:\r\n\r\n“Hondura is a friend of Bomba. Hondura speaks wise words. If Bomba is\r\nwise, he will stay in the maloca of Hondura and not go to the island of\r\nthe big cats.”\r\n\r\nBomba looked puzzled.\r\n\r\n“Why does Hondura tell this to Bomba?” he queried.\r\n\r\n“Because Hondura is friend of Bomba,” replied the chief gravely. “He\r\nwould not see Bomba put his head within the jaws of death.”\r\n\r\n“Is it because it is called Jaguar Island?” persisted the lad. “Is it\r\nthe big cats Hondura fears?”\r\n\r\nThe Indian shook his head.\r\n\r\n“The danger Hondura fears for Bomba,” he answered impressively, “is not\r\nof this world. It is of the world beyond. Be warned in time, Bomba.\r\nHondura has spoken.”\r\n\r\nAlthough Bomba had been taught by Casson to laugh at the superstitions\r\nof the natives, he had lived his life too far from civilization not to\r\nshare to some extent their primitive fear of the supernatural.\r\n\r\nThe words of Hondura sent a strange chill through him. What did the\r\nIndian mean?\r\n\r\n“Of what danger speak you, Hondura?” he asked in an awed voice. “Tell\r\nBomba, so that he may know the truth.”\r\n\r\n“Once a great many moons ago,” began Hondura, “there was above the\r\nisland of the great cats a big, strange city.”\r\n\r\nThe eyes of Bomba glistened.\r\n\r\n“Tell me of it!” he cried.\r\n\r\n“Those that knew of it said it was a city of devils, though its beauty\r\nwas that of the sun.”\r\n\r\n“What made its beauty like the sun?” was Bomba’s eager query.\r\n\r\n“The towers,” replied Hondura, “were of gold and reached upward like\r\ntrees to the sky. When men looked upon them long they had to cover\r\ntheir eyes with their hands. Else they would have gone blind.”\r\n\r\n“I wish that the eyes of Bomba might have seen it, Hondura!” exclaimed\r\nthe lad. He thought longingly of those faraway cities described to him\r\nby the boy named Frank, the white boy, son of the woman with the golden\r\nhair, who had once kissed Bomba as though he had been her son. Perhaps\r\nthis city with towers of gold was like those others. So he looked\r\neagerly, yearningly, at the wrinkled face of the grizzled chieftain who\r\nspoke with such a calm air of assurance.\r\n\r\n“It is many moons since the eyes of men have rested upon that city,”\r\nreturned the Indian sternly, seeming by his manner to rebuke the boy’s\r\nenthusiasm.\r\n\r\nBomba was abashed, but asked with undiminished curiosity:\r\n\r\n“What then became of the city of gold, Hondura? Tell Bomba so that he\r\nmay know the truth. His heart is thirsty like that of the tapir that\r\nbends its head toward the cool water.”\r\n\r\n“The city sank into the earth,” returned Hondura. “Slowly the mud of\r\nthe swamp crept up over it and the towers of gold were covered so that\r\nthey no more made blind the eyes of men.”\r\n\r\nThe chief seemed to sink into a reverie after this announcement, and\r\nBomba ventured to remind him of his presence by asking another question.\r\n\r\n“The city is gone. Where then is the danger to Bomba, O good and wise\r\nchief?”\r\n\r\nHondura roused himself from his abstraction and stared at Bomba almost\r\nas though he were looking through him to something sinister that lay\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\n“It is true that the city is gone. But strange ghosts arise from it,\r\nspirits that harm.”\r\n\r\nThe little Pirah cried out sharply, and Pipina started a long eerie\r\nwail that chilled Bomba to the marrow of his bones.\r\n\r\n“The evil spirits walk abroad at night,” the chief continued, “and woe\r\nis the portion of those who meet them. For they carry with them pain\r\nand pestilence and death. Of those who have met them in the darkness of\r\nthe night none have come back alive.”\r\n\r\nBomba was impressed despite himself. Nevertheless his determination\r\nremained unshaken.\r\n\r\n“The cause of Bomba is a good one,” he said simply. “Bomba does not\r\nfear the evil spirits.”\r\n\r\n“Hondura knows that Bomba does not fear anything living,” the chief\r\nresponded. “But he has no arrow that will sink into the breasts of the\r\ndead. He has no knife that can reach their hearts. They will not fear\r\nwhen Bomba defies them. They will laugh.”\r\n\r\n“I am going,” the lad declared.\r\n\r\nThe old chief nodded his head as though, knowing Bomba, he had expected\r\nsome such answer from the boy.\r\n\r\n“Go then. But go only to the island of the big cats. Do not go to the\r\nplace above the island where the city with the towers of gold stood.\r\nFind Japazy, the half-breed, and return with speed. Hondura and the\r\nlittle Pirah will watch for you. And we will have prayers made by the\r\nmedicine man that you do not meet the evil spirits.”\r\n\r\n“But do not go yet,” pleaded Pirah, clinging to his hand. “Pirah wants\r\nyou to stay days, many days. You are tired. You have been fighting. We\r\nwill make big feast if you will stay in the maloca of Hondura for a\r\ntime.”\r\n\r\nBomba returned the pressure of the warm little hand affectionately.\r\n\r\n“Pirah is good and Hondura too is good,” he said earnestly. “Bomba\r\nwould be glad to stay. But he must go.”\r\n\r\nHe turned to the chief.\r\n\r\n“I go first into the jungle to hunt for Casson,” he said. “I will look\r\nfor him till I find him or feel sure that he is dead. If I find him, I\r\nwill bring him back to stay with Hondura. If I do not find him, I will\r\ngo on to find Japazy on Jaguar Island.”\r\n\r\nPipina set up a wail, but Bomba checked her.\r\n\r\n“Do not cry, Pipina,” he said. “Bomba has many times gone into the\r\njungle and come back again. Did he not go to the Moving Mountain and\r\nreturn? Did he not come back from the Giant Cataract and the island of\r\nsnakes? The gods will watch over me, and you can stay here safe with\r\nthe women of Hondura’s tribe and help them with their cooking and their\r\nweaving. And you can tell them of the hole in the floor and how you\r\nwere wiser than all the warriors of Nascanora.”\r\n\r\nThe last was cunningly put, and the look of pride that came into the\r\nold woman’s eyes showed that if the Araos women failed to appreciate\r\nher strategy it would not be for lack of telling.\r\n\r\nBomba turned to the chief.\r\n\r\n“Your heart is big, Hondura, and your heart is good,” he said. “Bomba\r\nwill not forget.”\r\n\r\n“It is but little that Hondura is doing for Bomba,” the old chieftain\r\nreplied. “Did not Bomba save my people? Did he not bring back the women\r\nand little children that Nascanora’s bucks had stolen? My people would\r\ndie for Bomba. And I will tell my braves to hunt for Casson. Wherever\r\nthey go their eyes will be open for the old white man. They will be\r\nlooking while Bomba is on his way to Jaguar Island. And if he is alive,\r\nthey will find him.”\r\n\r\nThe assurance was an immense comfort to the heart of Bomba. If his own\r\nsearch for Casson failed, he would know that a host of sharp eyes were\r\ntaking up his work. All that could be done would be done for the old\r\nman he loved.\r\n\r\nHe stayed at the maloca only long enough to get some more strings for\r\nhis bow and to replenish his stock of arrows and put an additional edge\r\non his machete. Then, with a warm farewell to Hondura, Pirah, Pipina,\r\nand the assembled people of the tribe, he plunged into the jungle.\r\n\r\nHe thought longingly of the “fire stick” and the cartridges that had\r\nbeen destroyed in the blazing cabin. He took the now useless revolver\r\nfrom his pouch where he carried it in a waterproof covering and looked\r\nat it sadly. It was a fine weapon, and he had learned to use it\r\neffectively, though not yet with the perfect accuracy of the machete\r\nand the bow and arrows.\r\n\r\n“The fire stick might not hurt the ghosts from the sunken city,” he\r\npondered, as he turned the revolver lovingly in his hands; “but against\r\nthe beasts of the jungle and the braves of Nascanora it speaks with the\r\nvoice of death. And who knows but what it might save my life when I\r\nreach the place of the big cats.”\r\n\r\nAgain his anger flamed against the headhunters.\r\n\r\n“They may still, by robbing me of my cartridges, be the cause of my\r\ndeath,” he murmured.\r\n\r\nBut he had the fatalistic philosophy born of his life in the jungle.\r\nThe cartridges were gone. He could not help it. Perhaps it had been\r\ndecreed. Who was he, Bomba, to find fault with the laws that governed\r\nthe world?\r\n\r\nFor all the rest of that day he hunted feverishly for some trace of\r\nCasson. Hardly a foot of ground escaped his eager scrutiny. He searched\r\nevery thicket, explored every swamp. At times, when he felt it was\r\nsafe, he raised his voice in the hope that perhaps Casson might hear\r\nhim. But all his efforts were fruitless. There was no trace or sound of\r\nhis half-demented protector.\r\n\r\nDuring his search he had gathered some turtle eggs, and these he\r\nroasted at night over a fire before the opening of a cave that he had\r\nchosen for the night’s shelter.\r\n\r\nThe food was succulent, the fire comforting, and the cave reasonably\r\nsafe. Bomba built up the fire so that it should serve through the night\r\nto keep off the prowling denizens of the forest, and made his refuge\r\nsecure by rolling a great stone that no animal could dislodge to the\r\nentrance of the cave.\r\n\r\nThen he lay down and slept, not opening his tired eyes till the first\r\nbreak of dawn.\r\n\r\nAll that day and the next Bomba hunted for Cody Casson. He had given\r\nhimself three days before he would relinquish the quest as hopeless.\r\n\r\nOccasionally he came upon traces of the headhunters. But the tracks\r\nwere cold, and Bomba calculated that they were at least five days old.\r\nIf the bucks were in that region at all, they were probably lurking in\r\nthe vicinity of the cabin, where, soon or late, they could count on\r\nBomba’s reappearance.\r\n\r\nToward the evening of the third day Bomba caught sight of something\r\nstrange lying at the roots of a great tree in one of the most\r\nextensive swamps with which the region abounded.\r\n\r\nAt first sight it looked like a crumpled heap of rags. Bomba’s thought\r\nwas that it was the remains of an old hammock or native rug thrown\r\naside as useless.\r\n\r\nBut there was something in the shape of it that made him revise his\r\nopinion, and he approached it with the caution that he always used when\r\nin the presence of something which he did not understand.\r\n\r\nWhen at last he stood beside it he started back with a gasp.\r\n\r\nIt was a skeleton that lay there amid the shreds of garments that had\r\npreviously clothed the body!\r\n\r\nBomba had seen such grisly sights before. They were not uncommon in the\r\njungle, where natives without number met their end by the jaws of the\r\npuma and the fangs of the snake.\r\n\r\nNo, it was not the mere sight of a skeleton that made Bomba start so\r\nviolently.\r\n\r\nIt was the fact that _the skeleton was that of a white man_!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE SKELETON\r\n\r\n\r\nBomba knew at once that the poor remnant of humanity that lay before\r\nhim was not that of a native of the country.\r\n\r\nHe knew it by the character of the hair that still adhered to the\r\nscalp, by the fragments of skin that still were in evidence.\r\n\r\nAnd he knew by the clothes, which, though tattered into shreds, were\r\nsimilar to those that had been worn by Gillis and Dorn, by the men of\r\nthe Parkhurst family. They were of heavy khaki cut after the civilized\r\nfashion.\r\n\r\nSome hunter, no doubt; a hunter after big game or a hunter of rubber\r\ntrees, who had come into the dark recesses of the Amazonian jungle.\r\n\r\nVarious signs indicated that the body had been there for some time. How\r\nthe man had died would never be known. Somewhere in the civilized world\r\nhe was marked down as “missing.” The jungle kept its secrets well.\r\n\r\nBomba stood looking down at the skeleton with a strange feeling in his\r\nheart. This man had been white! He had been a brother to Bomba, of the\r\nsame blood, of the same race! A sense of kinship tugged at the lad’s\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nAnd because he had been white, Bomba determined that the poor remains\r\nshould have decent burial. He sought out a suitable piece of wood and\r\nwith his machete fashioned a rude spade. With this he set to work and\r\nsoon had dug a grave in the soft and muddy ground.\r\n\r\nHe lifted the skeleton reverently and bore it to the grave. As he did\r\nso, something dropped with a metallic sound. He paid no attention to\r\nthis at the moment, but bestowed the bones carefully in the grave.\r\nThen he covered it and rolled great stones over the top that the last\r\nresting place of the stranger might be undisturbed.\r\n\r\nHe knew little of prayer. He had seen, to be sure, the incantations\r\nthat the medicine men made to their gods. But something confused and\r\nvague shaped itself in his mind, an unspoken request that all might be\r\nwell with the white man, wherever his spirit might be. For was not the\r\nwhite man Bomba’s brother?\r\n\r\nHe was turning away when his eye caught sight of the something that\r\nhe had heard drop to the ground. He looked at it indifferently for a\r\nmoment and then he pounced upon it eagerly.\r\n\r\nIt was a belt of cartridges!\r\n\r\nHe handled the objects with a delight beyond all bounds. It was like a\r\ngift from the gods. With a trembling hand he took his revolver from its\r\npouch. The cartridges fitted perfectly!\r\n\r\nBomba was in a frenzy of rapture. He wanted to shout, to dance, to\r\nsing. Now he had another effective weapon, a formidable addition to his\r\nmachete and his bow and arrows.\r\n\r\n“I gave the white man burial, and he has given me these,” he said to\r\nhimself. “He knew that Bomba, too, was white! He knew that Bomba was\r\nhis brother!”\r\n\r\nWhere there were cartridges there were likely to be weapons, and\r\nBomba scanned the surrounding spaces carefully. But neither rifle nor\r\nrevolver was to be seen. Bomba conjectured that natives, passing, might\r\nhave found and appropriated these as curiosities, though they did not\r\nknow how to use them. The fact that the cartridge belt had not been\r\ndisturbed was probably due to a superstitious repugnance to touch a\r\ndead body for fear it would bring evil fortune.\r\n\r\nIt was with a vastly increased confidence that Bomba at last betook\r\nhimself from the scene.\r\n\r\nHis steps now turned toward a trail about which he had learned from the\r\ncaboclos of the district, a trail that after long journeying would lead\r\nhim to the river and to Jaguar Island, where Japazy dwelt.\r\n\r\nIf Bomba could find and keep to this trail, it would lead him more\r\nquickly to his destination and lessen the danger of his becoming lost\r\nin a section of the jungle into which he had not yet penetrated.\r\n\r\nIt was two days later that Bomba came upon the trail he sought. He\r\nrecognized it with a feeling of joy and thanksgiving.\r\n\r\n“Bomba is sure now of finding the way to Jaguar Island,” he told\r\nhimself. “If Japazy is there, all may be well. If not, Bomba will have\r\nhis long journey for nothing.”\r\n\r\nAs he struck out along the trail the lad was seized by a desire for\r\nspeed that was almost panic. Again and again the thought came to him,\r\ngiving new stimulus to his steps:\r\n\r\n“I may be an hour too late. I may be only a minute too late. If I reach\r\nthe island and find Japazy gone, what then? He is Bomba’s one hope.\r\nWithout the knowledge Japazy has, Bomba is doomed to live in the jungle\r\nforever. Bomba will never know about Bartow and Laura and the boy they\r\ncalled Bonny. Bomba must put wings to his feet.”\r\n\r\nAll that day he flogged himself along with this thought, stopping only\r\nto tear off and eat a strip of the tapir meat that he had brought with\r\nhim from the village of Hondura.\r\n\r\nBomba could not go without food, but he could go without sleep, or at\r\nleast do with very little.\r\n\r\nBut exhausted nature took its toll after he had traveled through the\r\nlong hours of the night and faced a gray-streaked dawn, spent and\r\nhaggard-eyed.\r\n\r\nSleep weighted his eyelids, dragged at his feet. Bomba lay down and\r\nslept.\r\n\r\nIn his sleep he dreamed. It was a terrible dream, and in it he was\r\nback again in the heart of the Moving Mountain. Flames licked at him\r\nhungrily, strange grumblings and roarings resounded about him, and yet\r\nhe could make no move to escape.\r\n\r\nWith a mighty gasping effort, Bomba heaved his body beyond the reach of\r\nthe fire--and opened his eyes!\r\n\r\nInstantly he was wide awake. Night had crept upon him while he slept,\r\nand now upon the wings of darkness rode a fearful storm filling the\r\njungle with wailings and thunderings.\r\n\r\nBomba leaped to his feet and looked about him.\r\n\r\n“I have slept the day away!” was his first angry thought. “If Bomba\r\ndoes not find Japazy it will be his own fault!”\r\n\r\nBut this consideration was soon swept aside by the realization of his\r\nown immediate peril.\r\n\r\nWith every moment the storm increased in fury. So far, it had been wind\r\nand thunder and lightning, but no rain. Now the heavens opened and the\r\nrain descended in blinding torrents.\r\n\r\nBomba was at a loss as to where to fly for shelter. His surroundings\r\nwere strange to him. He had slept in a thorn thicket that had protected\r\nhim from the inroad of wild beasts, but now offered little refuge from\r\nthe storm. He knew of no cave or native hut in the immediate vicinity.\r\n\r\nWhile he hesitated, there was a rending crash above his head.\r\n\r\nHe leaped back, but not in time. A tree, as though uprooted by a\r\ngiant’s hand, crashed to the ground, bearing all before it.\r\n\r\nBomba felt himself flung through the air, was conscious of a piercing\r\npain in the back of his head, and then for a time knew nothing.\r\n\r\nHow long he lay pinioned beneath the branches of the tree, Bomba did\r\nnot know. But when he woke again to a knowledge of his surroundings he\r\nfound that the storm still raged through the jungle. His head ached\r\nfiercely and he felt dizzy and sick.\r\n\r\nHis head was resting in something sticky and soft. Bomba thought\r\nat first that it might be blood from his head, for he remembered a\r\nterrific blow as he fell.\r\n\r\nBoth hands were imprisoned by the branches, but after considerable\r\neffort he managed to free one of them. This he moved cautiously about\r\nto the back of his head. There was a bump on it as big as an egg, but\r\nhe could discover no gash in the scalp.\r\n\r\nHis head then was not lying in a pool of blood. It was imbedded in the\r\nthick oozy mud of a swamp.\r\n\r\nBy a great strain he lifted his head a trifle and heard the thick suck\r\nof the ooze as it reluctantly released its prey.\r\n\r\nThen did Bomba’s heart almost misgive him. He could reconstruct now\r\nwhat had happened. The outflung branches of the tree had swept him over\r\nthe border of the treacherous ygapo near which he had been sleeping.\r\n\r\nHe lay now, half upon solid ground and half in the swamp. The branches\r\nof the tree pinioned the lower part of his body, but his head and\r\nshoulders rested in the thick muck. Then, with a thrill of horror, he\r\nrealized that he was sinking deeper. He knew how readily the ygapo\r\nengulfed anything that ventured upon it.\r\n\r\nHad his whole body lain in the ooze and had his unconsciousness\r\npersisted much longer, he would already have been in so deep that to\r\nextricate himself would have been impossible. But the solid ground\r\nbeneath the lower part of his body gave him a certain purchase, and he\r\nstrained to the utmost to raise his head and shoulders so as to make\r\ntheir weight as light as possible.\r\n\r\nHis plight was desperate. The branches of the tree reached to his\r\nshoulders. He could manage to use only his left hand and arm, for the\r\nright one seemed to be numb. It had no sense of feeling. Bomba knew\r\nthat it must have received a hard blow, perhaps be broken.\r\n\r\nWith the free use of his machete he might have hacked a way through to\r\nfreedom, although even with the aid of the knife it would have been a\r\nslow and painful process.\r\n\r\nBut the machete was in his belt near that right hand that had no sense\r\nof feeling. To get at it with his left he would first have to break\r\naway the branches that pressed so heavily upon his chest. And to do\r\nthis with his bare hands seemed impossible.\r\n\r\nBomba tried to hold his head above the ooze, raising it by the sheer\r\nstrength of his shoulders until the straining muscles could no longer\r\nbear the weight. And when, groaning, he let his head sink back, the mud\r\nsucked at it gloatingly.\r\n\r\n“This, then, is the end of Bomba,” the lad muttered to himself\r\ngloomily. “He would have liked to die on his feet, fighting. But he\r\nmust die here alone like any trapped beast of the jungle.”\r\n\r\nThe jungle! There lay the nub of his bitterness. Why should he be in\r\nthe jungle, he a white boy, whose rightful heritage of a life with his\r\nown kind had been denied him by a cruel fate? Why did he not have a\r\nhome like that of Frank Parkhurst, a father who was proud of him, a\r\nmother who loved him? Why had he been fated to have his life placed\r\nevery day in jeopardy? He had been cheated of what belonged to him\r\nequally with every other boy of the white race.\r\n\r\n“I shall never see Casson now, if he be still alive,” he murmured.\r\n“Japazy, the half-breed, will die with the secret that I seek still\r\nhidden in his heart.”\r\n\r\nThen his anger at fate turned against himself.\r\n\r\n“Bomba was a fool to sleep,” he gritted through his clenched teeth. “If\r\nhe had been awake, he would have seen the storm approaching and would\r\nhave found some cave or overhanging rock for shelter. Bomba is a fool\r\nand deserves to die.”\r\n\r\nHe began tearing at the branches with his one free hand, though he knew\r\nhe could not lift that weight from his chest. He lifted his head and\r\ntried to reach the twigs with his teeth. He was half mad with rage and\r\nblack despair.\r\n\r\nThen, in a turning of his head, he saw a sight that chilled his blood.\r\nHis body became instantly as rigid as stone.\r\n\r\nNot ten feet from him he saw a mass of coils that he recognized from\r\nthe markings as that of the Brazilian rattlesnake, the jararaca.\r\n\r\nThe mass lay almost motionless and, except for an occasional slight\r\nheaving as from breathing, the reptile might have seemed dead. The\r\nhead was not visible.\r\n\r\nWas it sleeping? Or had it perhaps been wounded, swept to that place as\r\nBomba had been by the branches of the tree?\r\n\r\nIf the reptile were sleeping, any movement of Bomba’s might wake it.\r\nEven if it were wounded, it would certainly make an effort to destroy\r\nthe lad if it should discover him.\r\n\r\nIt seemed only a matter of dying in one way or another. Either the\r\nsnake or the swamp would bring him death. In either case his death\r\nwould be a horrible one.\r\n\r\nOh, if he were only on his feet, machete in hand!\r\n\r\nThere was a movement of the sluggish coils. Bomba watched them with a\r\nhorrid fascination, scarcely daring to breathe.\r\n\r\nGradually the coils unwound. The hideous triangular head came in sight.\r\nThe reptile looked slowly about as though deciding which way to go.\r\n\r\nThen the snake saw Bomba!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nWRITHING COILS\r\n\r\n\r\nBomba saw the malignant fury that came into the snake’s eyes. He knew\r\nthat the reptile had seen him, and over the boy’s face, like a pallid\r\ncloak, spread the calmness of despair.\r\n\r\nThis then was the end! He might live perhaps ten, fifteen, possibly\r\ntwenty minutes after the poison fangs had sunk into his flesh, and they\r\nwould be minutes of such intolerable agony that death, when it came,\r\nwould be welcomed as a friend.\r\n\r\nThe snake uncoiled and crawled swiftly toward Bomba until it came\r\nwithin striking distance. Then it threw itself into a coil and reared\r\nits head.\r\n\r\nBomba saw that head, those open jaws dripping poison, closed his eyes\r\nand waited for death.\r\n\r\nBut even while he waited, something swished past his head, coming from\r\nthe tree above.\r\n\r\nIt was a castanha nut, one of those huge, heavy nuts that, falling on a\r\nman’s head, may fracture his skull.\r\n\r\nThe missile, flung with deadly aim, hit the head of the rattlesnake,\r\ncrushing it into pulp.\r\n\r\nBomba opened his eyes as the coils of the dead snake writhed and lashed\r\nabout his head.\r\n\r\nBy some miracle the enemy had been vanquished. Was it the storm that\r\nhad loosened the great nut which was almost as large as Bomba’s head?\r\nIf so, it was perhaps a sign from the gods of the Indians that Bomba\r\nwas not to die until his work should be accomplished.\r\n\r\nBut his first joy at his deliverance was quickly followed by\r\napprehension and the realization that he might still be in the shadow\r\nof death. He had escaped the fangs of the serpent. But who or what\r\ncould rescue him from the greedy clutch of the swamp?\r\n\r\nAs though in answer to the thought, something dropped from the tree\r\nbeside him.\r\n\r\nWhat was this? A new enemy?\r\n\r\nBomba lay very still as the shape came toward him. Whether it was man\r\nor beast he could not tell, for there was no word from the one or growl\r\nfrom the other.\r\n\r\nThen a hairy paw was laid upon his arm, and Bomba thrilled with a new\r\nhope. He knew the touch of that paw, knew that at last he had met a\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n“Doto!” he cried. “Good Doto! So you have come to Bomba. And Bomba\r\nnever needed you more.”\r\n\r\nThe friendly monkey, almost the size of Bomba himself, pressed close\r\nto Bomba’s side and chattered delightedly. For he was one of the chief\r\nanimal friends that Bomba had made in the jungle. Bomba had once saved\r\nDoto’s life, and more than once since then Doto had been of great\r\nservice to Bomba in warning him of enemies.\r\n\r\nBomba was exceedingly fond of the big monkey, and now he stroked the\r\nhairy arm and head affectionately.\r\n\r\n“Once more Doto has saved the life of Bomba,” the lad said. “Bomba is\r\ngrateful.”\r\n\r\nThe monkey pressed against him, answering in a language Bomba had come\r\nto understand. But suddenly Doto sprang to his feet, looking about him\r\nexcitedly. He began to jabber wildly, and Bomba knew that he scented\r\ndanger of some kind.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some wild beast was approaching. Perhaps the headhunters were\r\ncreeping upon them.\r\n\r\n“Doto wants Bomba to be free?” asked Bomba, and the monkey broke into a\r\nchatter of assent. “Then Doto must help Bomba,” and the lad pointed to\r\nthe mass of branches that held him prisoner.\r\n\r\n“Doto break branches so that Bomba can get knife that is at his belt,”\r\ndirected the jungle boy.\r\n\r\nThe monkey appeared to understand and set to work at once, breaking\r\noff the smaller branches and bending the larger ones so that he could\r\nreach beneath them.\r\n\r\nThe storm was clearing away. The rain had almost stopped, the wind blew\r\nin fitful gusts. Bomba stared up at the sky while hope once more flowed\r\nlike a warm flood into his heart.\r\n\r\n“The machete, Doto!” he cried. “Get the big knife of Bomba!”\r\n\r\nHe had often showed the knife to Doto in their conferences in the\r\nforest and boasted of its power. Doto knew what Bomba meant when he\r\nspoke of the machete, and he knew also that Bomba carried it at his\r\nbelt. He reached his furry paw beneath the branches and drew forth the\r\nweapon.\r\n\r\nBomba gave a cry of delight as his hand once more closed on the haft of\r\nhis faithful machete.\r\n\r\n“Good Doto!” he exclaimed. “Bomba has his big knife. All is well again.”\r\n\r\nThe task of cutting away the imprisoning branches was a laborious one,\r\nflat upon his back as he was and having only the use of his left hand.\r\n\r\nBut it was the faithful Doto who lifted the boy’s head from the ooze\r\nand supported his shoulder so that he could do the work more easily.\r\n\r\nGradually the bonds across his chest relaxed their grip. Doto raised\r\nhim higher and higher until he had reached a sitting position. Then\r\nthe work went on apace.\r\n\r\nBomba tried to move his right arm but found that there was still no\r\nfeeling in it. He did not spend any time over it, but went on hacking\r\naway with his left hand.\r\n\r\nHe grew tired and paused at times to rest, but it was always Doto that\r\nurged him on to fresh effort. That the monkey scented danger, Bomba\r\nknew, and yet, listen as he would, he could hear no sound that had\r\nmenace in it.\r\n\r\nStill he trusted the instinct of the monkey. The ears of Bomba were\r\nkeen, but those of Doto were keener still.\r\n\r\nSo he forced himself to labor when his muscles were crying out urgently\r\nfor rest. Gradually the weight upon his legs lifted. He found that he\r\ncould move one of them, then the other.\r\n\r\n“Bomba thinks he can get out now, if Doto will help,” said the lad.\r\n\r\nHe placed the monkey’s paws beneath his shoulders and signified that it\r\nwas to pull with all its strength.\r\n\r\nThis Doto did, and Bomba ground his teeth with pain as he was at last\r\ndrawn clear of the branches.\r\n\r\nWith difficulty he stood upon his feet, leaning heavily against Doto.\r\n\r\nHe was stiff and sore in every muscle. It was agony even to draw a deep\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nStill, the heart of the lad swelled with exultation and a new sense of\r\npower. He stood upright, his machete was at his side; his bow was still\r\nintact, his quiver full of arrows, and in his pouch was his greatly\r\nprized revolver, once again fully loaded.\r\n\r\nHe felt of his right arm and found that it was unbroken. There was a\r\nnumbness in it that gave place to pain as the blood began to pulse\r\nstrongly through it, but Bomba knew that in a short time it would be as\r\nwell as ever.\r\n\r\n“The bones of Bomba bend but they do not break,” the lad exulted.\r\n\r\nBut Doto’s anxiety was still unabated. His uneasiness increased with\r\nevery moment, and he pressed closely against Bomba, urging him to leave\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\nBomba tried a few steps and found that he could walk, though\r\nwaveringly. So he motioned to the monkey to go ahead and lead the way.\r\n\r\nThis Doto did with great alacrity, pausing when his pace became too\r\nswift for Bomba and waiting till the boy caught up with him.\r\n\r\nThus they traveled for a considerable distance through the jungle.\r\nThe storm had worn itself out. The treetops were still agitated by\r\noccasional sharp gusts of wind, but where Bomba and Doto sped along\r\nthe jungle lay in an almost deathlike hush.\r\n\r\n“Where is it that Doto takes Bomba?” asked the lad, easing his bruised\r\nmuscles as he paused to rest. “We must not go too far from the trail,\r\nfor Bomba must press on to the island of the big cats where lives\r\nJapazy, the half-breed.”\r\n\r\nFor answer Doto broke into a frantic chattering and pulled the boy\r\nalong by the arm.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the eyes of Bomba narrowed and he pressed a hand over the\r\nmonkey’s mouth.\r\n\r\n“Wait!” he commanded sharply. “Bomba has heard something in the jungle.”\r\n\r\nThe monkey’s chatter ceased, and behind him in the darkness Bomba heard\r\nthe faint sound of padding feet.\r\n\r\nHe listened and heard it again, but not in the same place. Again the\r\nfaint pad, pad of feet moving stealthily, but this time more to the\r\neast.\r\n\r\nOnce more that ominous sound. This time to the north.\r\n\r\nBomba knew that sound. He knew the smell that came to his keen nostrils.\r\n\r\nPumas! Three of them at least. They were stalking him, moving in a\r\nsemicircle, closing in upon him!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE TRAILING PUMAS\r\n\r\n\r\nAgainst one puma, despite its terrible teeth and claws, Bomba would\r\nhave had a fair chance of success in warding off an attack. His arrow\r\nmight reach its heart before it could spring.\r\n\r\nBut if three attacked at once, he would have no chance at all. He and\r\nDoto must reach some place of safety quickly, or they were lost.\r\n\r\nDoto was tugging frantically at his arm, and Bomba broke into a quick\r\npantherlike run. But the pumas quickened their pace also, instinct\r\ntelling them that their intended surprise had failed. There was the\r\nbreaking of brushwood all about as the great beasts burst through.\r\n\r\nWith Doto still clutching his arm, Bomba and the monkey plunged\r\ntogether into a dark and narrow passage.\r\n\r\nEven as they rushed within the cave, the pumas sprang to the attack.\r\n\r\nBut two of them, in making for the hole through which their prey\r\nthreatened to escape, collided with a thud of heavy bodies.\r\n\r\nThe entrance was too narrow for both, and their heads were jammed\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThey pulled back, snapping and snarling, and in a second were engaged\r\nin deadly combat.\r\n\r\nThe diversion seemed to give Bomba the chance that he wanted. He\r\nslipped the bow from his shoulder and drew an arrow from his quiver.\r\n\r\nBut the implement must have been injured in the fall of the tree, for\r\nas Bomba drew it taut the frayed string broke with an ominous snap.\r\n\r\nBomba threw the bow aside with an exclamation of anger. Then he drew\r\nhis revolver from its pouch and, reaching for his machete, held it in\r\nhis left hand.\r\n\r\nWith either he could wound, perhaps kill, one of his enemies. But he\r\nwas still uncertain but what the others would have to be reckoned with,\r\nand, in that case, he knew how slim his chances were of coming through\r\nthe fight alive.\r\n\r\nThe two pumas still fought, however, locked in a deadly embrace that\r\nwould probably mean death for one of them, perhaps both. In their\r\nstruggle they had rolled a short distance from the mouth of the cave,\r\nand Bomba could hear them thrashing about in the brushwood.\r\n\r\nBut where was the third puma?\r\n\r\nThen Bomba felt rather than heard the stealthy approach of the great\r\nbrute.\r\n\r\nTwo yellow glints appeared before the mouth of the cave. Two glaring,\r\nsinister eyes peered in. Bomba shrank back into the darkness and his\r\ngrip tightened about his weapons.\r\n\r\nBut as he waited, braced for the attack, he felt a sharp pull on his\r\narm. It came from Doto, who was chattering wildly.\r\n\r\nBomba tried to shake off the paw.\r\n\r\n“Do not hinder Bomba, Doto,” he hissed through his set teeth. “Bomba\r\nfights for his life.”\r\n\r\nBut Doto persisted, and by main strength drew Bomba back, took the\r\nboy’s hand, and laid it upon something that was cold to the touch.\r\nInstantly Bomba grasped the monkey’s meaning.\r\n\r\nHere was a rock, a great rock, set not far from the entrance. If they\r\ncould roll it across that gaping opening, their lives might yet be\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\nThe fierce snarling of the fighting pumas came to them from the dense\r\nshadow of the underbrush. They were busy doing Bomba’s work for him.\r\nFar more fearsome at the moment was that huge figure at the mouth of\r\nthe cave.\r\n\r\nThe third puma was cautious. The hole was black. The man creature would\r\nbe armed with things that stung. The beast still limped from an arrow\r\nwound in the leg, probably inflicted by an Indian, and was distrustful\r\nof the creatures that walked on two legs.\r\n\r\nBomba hastily thrust his weapons back into his pouch. With the help of\r\nDoto, who was stronger than the average man, he rolled the great stone\r\nslowly, strainingly, toward the yawning mouth of the cave.\r\n\r\nFour feet, five, six. They pushed pantingly. The rock already covered\r\npart of the entrance, but there was still room for the puma to push\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nAt this point the beast realized what they were trying to do!\r\n\r\nWith a blood-curdling snarl of rage it leaped forward. With one great\r\ndespairing heave Bomba and Doto pushed the rock against the opening,\r\nsealing it.\r\n\r\nNot a minute, not a second too soon!\r\n\r\nThe great stone caught the foot of the puma, crushing it. With a roar\r\nof rage and pain the brute pulled the injured member free and limped\r\naway, all the fight taken out of him for the time.\r\n\r\nBomba leaned against the rock, exhausted but jubilant. Doto crouched\r\nclose beside him, trembling.\r\n\r\nBomba reached out a hand and caressed the head of the faithful monkey.\r\n\r\n“Bomba has good friend in Doto,” said the lad earnestly. “Doto could\r\nhave saved himself in the trees and left Bomba to the hungry jaws of\r\nthe puma. Again Doto has saved the life of Bomba, and Bomba will not\r\nforget.”\r\n\r\nThe monkey snuggled closer against him and made a little contented\r\nsound like a child that is happy and humming softly to itself.\r\n\r\n“But what Bomba does not understand,” went on the jungle boy, speaking\r\nmore to himself than the monkey, “is how Doto was so sure of finding\r\nthe cave. Has Doto been here before?”\r\n\r\nDoto made a sound that Bomba interpreted as assent.\r\n\r\nBomba made a quick exploration of the cave to make sure that there was\r\nno entrance from the back. Then he lay down for a much-needed rest.\r\n\r\nHis body was sore and aching, and he was exhausted physically and\r\nmentally by the fearful strain he had undergone.\r\n\r\nDoto lay down close to him, content to be within reaching distance of a\r\npat from the boy’s hand.\r\n\r\nThe mind of Bomba was full of many things. He was both glad and\r\nsorrowful. Glad, because twice that night he had been snatched from the\r\nvery jaws of death. Sorrowful, because by reason of these perils he had\r\nbeen delayed so long on his journey to Japazy.\r\n\r\nThe panic of dread was still upon him lest on reaching Jaguar Island he\r\nmight find Japazy gone.\r\n\r\nAnd Casson! Dear old Casson! Was he still in the land of the living?\r\nHad the Hondura perchance found him, and was he now safe and sound in\r\nthe friendly maloca? Bomba scarcely dared hope, and yet he forced\r\nhimself to hope, for he could not bear the thought that he might not\r\nsee the old man again.\r\n\r\nBomba was glad of the presence of Doto, because it relieved to some\r\nextent his loneliness. Yet even this thought was not without its bitter\r\nquality.\r\n\r\n“Bomba is white,” he said to himself, “and yet he is grateful for the\r\npresence of a friendly beast of the jungle. Will Bomba never know even\r\nhis name? Will he never know the name of the beautiful woman in the\r\npicture, the lovely face that seemed to smile down at Bomba?”\r\n\r\nMusing thus, he fell asleep and did not wake until the sun was painting\r\nthe jungle in a riot of gorgeous colors.\r\n\r\nIt was dark within the cave, but Bomba knew that the morning had come\r\nby the screaming of the parrots and the chattering of the monkeys in\r\nthe jungle without.\r\n\r\nHe was bent like an old man because of the soreness in his muscles, and\r\none leg was lame where the cruel branches of the descending tree had\r\nbruised the tendons.\r\n\r\nDoto sensed his condition, and tried by chatter and gesture to induce\r\nthe boy to remain in the cave for a while until his bruised body was\r\nwell again.\r\n\r\nBomba hesitated, for he knew well that he should not face the dangers\r\nof the jungle in his half-crippled condition. The cave was safe. There\r\nwas enough cooked meat in the pouch at his waist to feed both Doto and\r\nhimself, if the monkey should elect to stay with him.\r\n\r\nThe boy was tempted. But then the great urge to be on his way swept\r\nover him. He thought of Japazy and what he would lose, how great would\r\nbe his desperation if he failed to meet the half-breed and get from him\r\nthe secret of his birth.\r\n\r\nSo slowly, reluctantly, he shook his head.\r\n\r\n“Bomba must go on, Doto,” he said, as he smoothed the shaggy head.\r\n“The cave is warm and safe and comfortable and there is meat in plenty\r\nfor Bomba and Doto, but Bomba must go into the jungle to meet whatever\r\nwaits for him there. Bomba cannot linger here, even though his going\r\nmay mean death to him. He must take his chance.”\r\n\r\nBomba offered the monkey some of his share of the tapir meat. But Doto\r\nshook his head. He would eat meat if he were starving, but he preferred\r\nthe cocoanuts that he had only to break open to get at their succulent\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\nBut Bomba ate ravenously of the tapir meat, for he had had nothing to\r\neat since morning of the day before. The food put new life into him and\r\nprepared him for the strenuous task that lay before him.\r\n\r\nWith the help of Doto he rolled back the stone from before the entrance\r\nof the cave. They left a space only wide enough for their own bodies to\r\npass through, if a survey of their surroundings should signal the need\r\nof retreat.\r\n\r\nThere was a chance that one of the pumas at least had not been content\r\nto leave the spot where the boy and the monkey had disappeared. The\r\nenemy might still be waiting among the trees or thickets ready to\r\npounce on the first that should issue forth from the cave.\r\n\r\nSo Bomba moved with the caution that was habitual with him, hand on his\r\nmachete, eyes darting in all directions.\r\n\r\nDoto swung himself into the treetops and described a wide circle about\r\nthe spot. Bomba knew that precious little would escape the monkey’s\r\nprying eyes.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the monkey’s chatter became so loud and agitated that Bomba\r\nthought it might be meant as a warning to him, and began to make a\r\nhasty retreat toward the cave.\r\n\r\nBut in a moment he realized that it was not a warning but a summons,\r\nand he began slowly to approach the tree from which Doto was hanging by\r\none paw. With the other he was pointing eagerly to something that lay\r\non the ground, hidden, so far, from Bomba’s view.\r\n\r\nThe boy pushed aside the underbrush and then understood what had caused\r\nDoto’s agitation.\r\n\r\nA giant puma lay on its side in a pool of blood, its throat horribly\r\nmangled and torn.\r\n\r\nOne of the gladiators of the night before!\r\n\r\nBomba knew that but for the timely interference and help of Doto, he,\r\ntoo, might have been lying in some such pool as this. But he would not\r\nhave been as intact as the puma. All that would have been left of him\r\nwould have been a few scattered bones. He would have furnished a royal\r\nmeal for the denizens of the jungle.\r\n\r\nHe stood for a moment looking thoughtfully at the beast, his eyes\r\ngleaming, lips drawn back a little to show two rows of even white teeth.\r\n\r\nThen he flung back his head and turned to the monkey.\r\n\r\n“Bomba will never forget what Doto has done,” he said. “But now Bomba\r\nmust go. He must say farewell to Doto. It may be many moons before\r\nBomba will see Doto again.”\r\n\r\nThe monkey whimpered and put his hand on Bomba’s shoulder. No human\r\nbeing could have asked more clearly that he be permitted to go along.\r\n\r\nBut Bomba smiled affectionately and patted the creature’s head.\r\n\r\n“Bomba must go alone,” he said. “He must sail great waters where Doto\r\nwould be lonely and afraid because there were not any trees. Doto must\r\ngo back to his own people. But if he ever needs Bomba and can call to\r\nhim, Bomba will come. For Doto has been a good friend to Bomba.”\r\n\r\nHe pointed to a tree, and the monkey left him slowly and reluctantly,\r\nswung himself into the tree, and was soon lost to sight among the\r\nfoliage.\r\n\r\nBomba looked after him sadly, sighed, and then began preparations for\r\nhis journey.\r\n\r\nFirst he looked to his weapons. He found the revolver in perfect shape,\r\nits waterproof covering having protected it from moisture. He took one\r\nof the strongest and most pliant strings of those that Hondura had\r\ngiven him and strung it to his bow. He tested it in every way until he\r\nknew that it could be absolutely depended upon.\r\n\r\nFor of all his weapons the one on which he placed most reliance was\r\nhis bow. To this, he had been habituated almost from babyhood, and the\r\nskill he had attained was phenomenal. Gillis and Dorn, the white rubber\r\nhunters, had been dumbfounded at the marvelous accuracy of his shooting.\r\n\r\nAt close range with a human opponent the revolver perhaps would prove\r\nthe most efficient. But at a longer distance the bow was the better. He\r\ncould send an arrow clear through the body of any beast of the jungle.\r\nThe alligator’s body with its tough armor might defy the shaft. But\r\nthe alligator had eyes and, small as they were, they supplied a big\r\nenough target for Bomba to pierce.\r\n\r\n“Without this bow,” murmured Bomba to himself, as he gave it an\r\naffectionate pat and slung it over his shoulder, “what chance would\r\nBomba have to find meat to eat? How could he defend himself against the\r\nwild beasts that seek his life? He would be helpless and could never\r\nhope to reach the island of the big cats.”\r\n\r\nIn his flight to the cave from the pumas Bomba had departed widely from\r\nhis original trail, and it took him some time to find it again. This he\r\ndid at last, and struck out once more for that river that flowed about\r\nthe island where Japazy dwelt.\r\n\r\nHe knew that he was now about to enter upon the most dangerous part\r\nof his journey. The region into which he was penetrating was wild and\r\nperilous and filled with pitfalls for the unwary traveler. Because of\r\nthe superstition surrounding the sunken city with the towers of gold,\r\nthe Indians gave this district a wide berth, and it was almost wholly\r\ndevoid of human life.\r\n\r\nAs a result, the beasts that inhabited the region had grown bolder and\r\nmore savage than in more thickly populated sections. There were no\r\nbows and arrows, no poisoned traps to thin their numbers. A traveler\r\nneeded eyes in the back of his head, and at the sides as well, to guard\r\nhimself against the dangers that surrounded him.\r\n\r\nAnother handicap attached itself to Bomba’s journey. In that part of\r\nthe jungle where Bomba had grown up he had learned of places of refuge\r\nfor times of sudden stress. He knew of caves, of crevices only wide\r\nenough for himself to squeeze through, of deserted cabins, of hollow\r\ntrees, of a host of similar hiding places and temporary fortresses.\r\nMore than once these had saved his life when he was hard-pressed. But\r\nin this new region that he was entering he was a complete stranger. If\r\nhe came upon a refuge, it would be by chance. And his foes were legion.\r\n\r\nBomba would have figured out all of these things by himself, even if he\r\nhad not been warned by his friend, Hondura. But not for a moment did he\r\ndream of turning back. As far as is possible to human nature, the lad\r\nwas absolutely devoid of fear. And now, with his trusty bow again in\r\nshape, he went on with renewed confidence.\r\n\r\nHe came to the banks of a stream and rubbed his sore muscles with the\r\nwarm mud. This took some of the ache from them, and he found that he\r\ncould walk with greater ease and make much better progress. His spirits\r\nrose as he dried himself and swung off buoyantly on the trail.\r\n\r\n“Bomba may still be in time to see Japazy and get the truth from his\r\nlips,” he assured himself, and in that mood felt capable of moving\r\nmountains, even that formidable mountain on which Jojasta had dwelt.\r\n\r\nThe hope that before many days had sped he would have realized his\r\nheart’s desire quickened his steps until he found himself breaking into\r\na run.\r\n\r\nFor two days more he traveled along a trail that grew ever more\r\ndifficult. The lack of human inhabitants had caused the trail in many\r\nplaces to be overgrown, and Bomba’s machete was in almost constant\r\nrequisition to hack a way for him. This involved not only arduous labor\r\nbut the loss of precious time, and the boy fumed and fretted. Yet he\r\nnever grew discouraged, never even thought of turning back.\r\n\r\nBomba had never heard the word “impossible.” If he had, he would not\r\nhave understood it. If it had been explained to him, he would have\r\nlaughed and refused to believe it. Nothing was impossible to Bomba, if\r\nhe had determined to do it. It would take nothing less than death to\r\nprove that he had been mistaken.\r\n\r\nThe food he had brought with him from Hondura’s camp grew monotonous\r\nbefore long, but he managed to vary his diet by turtle eggs, fish and\r\nthe bringing down of an occasional wild pig.\r\n\r\nSometimes he stopped to cook the meat; at other times he ate it raw.\r\nAlways he hurried on, flogging himself to renewed effort, allowing only\r\nthe most meager intervals for food and rest.\r\n\r\nThen one day, when he had come upon the trail of a tapir and was\r\nstalking it, that sixth sense of his told him that he, too, was being\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nHe faced about and stood tense and silent, eyes searching the shadows\r\nof the jungle.\r\n\r\nAt first he heard and saw nothing and was almost inclined to chide\r\nhimself for his suspicions. Then a slight movement in the underbrush at\r\nhis right caught his eye.\r\n\r\nNow he saw what had before been hidden from him, a crouching, sinuous\r\nbody, ears laid flat against a wicked head, eyes gleaming and greedy.\r\n\r\n“A jaguar!” muttered Bomba, as he quickly fitted an arrow to his bow.\r\n“Already they lie in wait for me. Bomba must kill this one as a warning\r\nto the others to beware.”\r\n\r\nBut even as Bomba stretched his bow, the jaguar, giving a ferocious\r\nroar, sprang!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nA TERRIFIC BATTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nBut even while the beast was in mid-air, a great yellow body came\r\nhurtling over the underbrush and struck the jaguar almost at right\r\nangles.\r\n\r\nThe impact was terrible, and the two brutes went down in a heap.\r\nSnarling and spitting, they scrambled up and faced each other, and the\r\nnext moment were engaged in a life and death grapple.\r\n\r\nThe thud of the collision had come just as Bomba’s bow twanged. The\r\narrow would have found its mark unerringly if the body of the jaguar\r\nhad not been thrown out of the line of its flight.\r\n\r\nAstounded beyond expression, Bomba thought for a moment that two\r\njaguars were doing battle for their prey. But the next moment he\r\nrecognized in the newcomer Polulu, the great puma, Bomba’s chief friend\r\nand ally among the jungle folk.\r\n\r\n“Polulu!” he gasped in delight. “Good Polulu! He saw that Bomba was in\r\ndanger and has come to his help.”\r\n\r\nIt was a titanic struggle that was going on before his eyes. Both\r\nbrutes were among the largest and most powerful of their kind. They\r\nrolled over and over, tearing from each other great strips of hide,\r\nfighting with teeth and claws, each trying to get a death hold on the\r\nother’s throat.\r\n\r\nBomba drew as near the antagonists as he could, circling about in\r\nan attempt to find a target in the jaguar. But the two beasts were\r\nwhirling about like a giant pinwheel, first one on top and then the\r\nother, and Bomba did not dare use either arrow or machete for fear that\r\nhe would wound or kill Polulu instead of the jaguar.\r\n\r\nBut Polulu needed no help to dispose of his enemy. He had no match in\r\nthe jungle for size and strength, and was rapidly getting the better of\r\nthe combat when, with a savage roar, a second jaguar, possibly the mate\r\nof the first, plunged into the fight.\r\n\r\nThe newcomer sank its teeth deep into Polulu’s flank while at the same\r\ntime a claw of its hindleg tore a strip of the puma’s hide. Polulu\r\nturned upon his second assailant and gave him a blow with his great paw\r\nthat loosened the brute’s hold and sent him rolling six feet away. But\r\nthe jaguar was up in an instant and returned to the attack. At the same\r\ntime the first jaguar, inspired to fresh efforts by the coming of its\r\nally, redoubled the ferocity of its fighting.\r\n\r\nThe odds were too great. Polulu could have conquered either jaguar\r\nalone with comparative ease. But with two attacking him at once, he had\r\nno chance.\r\n\r\nSuch rage swept over Bomba as he had scarcely ever known before. With\r\na yell of encouragement to Polulu, he leaped into the fray, throwing\r\ncaution to the winds. His only thought was that Polulu, his friend,\r\nmust not die.\r\n\r\nHe buried his hand in the thick fur of the second jaguar’s neck, and as\r\nthe beast turned snarling to meet this new attack, raised his machete\r\nand, with all his force, drove it downward.\r\n\r\nHe sensed the bite of the sharp steel on flesh, felt it slip along bone\r\nand reach the brain of the beast.\r\n\r\nAs though lifted by an earthquake, Bomba was hurled from the back of\r\nthe jaguar upon the ground. With a roar that echoed and re-echoed\r\nthrough the jungle, the stricken brute rose on its hind legs, pawed the\r\nair blindly for a moment, and then fell.\r\n\r\nBomba lifted himself, half-dazed, on his elbow and stared at the great\r\ncat, a moment before so terrible, now stretched out prone and inert.\r\n\r\nThen the lad scrambled to his feet, regained his machete, which had\r\nbeen knocked from his hand as he withdrew it, and hurried again to the\r\nhelp of Polulu.\r\n\r\nBut Polulu stood in no need of help. Relieved of the flank attack, he\r\nhad at last got the hold upon his opponent’s throat for which he had\r\nbeen seeking, and in a few moments more the fight was over.\r\n\r\nPolulu rose to his feet and sent a roar of triumph through the jungle.\r\nBut he staggered as he did it, and then he sank down on the ground,\r\npanting, too spent and exhausted even to lick his wounds.\r\n\r\nBomba was beside him on the instant, caressing the great brute’s\r\nshaggy head. The animal’s eyes, of late so furious, were now soft with\r\naffection, and it tried weakly to lick Bomba’s hand.\r\n\r\n“Good Polulu!” cried the lad. “Brave Polulu! There is no beast of the\r\njungle so strong as Polulu, the friend of Bomba. He has saved Bomba’s\r\nlife.”\r\n\r\nThe queer friendship between the two had begun some years before when\r\nBomba had found the puma pinned beneath a falling tree that had caught\r\nand broken one of its legs. Bomba had been stirred to pity by the\r\nanimal’s plight, had released it from the trap, bound up the broken\r\nleg, and nursed the puma, bringing it food and drink until the leg had\r\nmended. The brute had sensed his pity and goodness of heart and had\r\nbeen intensely grateful. By the time it was well again it had grown as\r\nfond of Bomba as a dog is of its master.\r\n\r\nAgain and again they had met in the jungle, and on several occasions,\r\nin times of great stress, Bomba had owed his life to the puma’s\r\ndevotion. And now he was once more in the animal’s debt.\r\n\r\nBomba saw that the animal was bleeding from a dozen wounds, many of\r\nthem deep, from which the blood was flowing freely. The lad ran to a\r\nstream that rippled through the brushwood not far off and brought back\r\nwater with which he washed the wounds. Then he covered them with river\r\nmud, the universal and healing ointment of the jungle. Polulu let him\r\ndo as he would, purring his gratitude and rubbing his head against the\r\nlad’s body.\r\n\r\nThen, having done all he could to sooth the pain and staunch the\r\nbleeding, Bomba offered Polulu food and drink. But though the beast\r\ndrank avidly of the cool water, he would not touch the food.\r\n\r\nBomba’s own supplies were running low now, and he saw in the dead\r\njaguars a chance to replenish them. Jaguar meat was not exactly the\r\nkind of food that would please an epicure, but it was eatable, and the\r\nopportunity could not be neglected. The lad cut great steaks from the\r\nbodies, built a fire and roasted them. Then he ate to repletion and\r\nstored what was left away in his pouch for future needs. By this time\r\nPolulu was so far recovered that he was ready to join in the feast.\r\n\r\nBomba patted the great brute on the head and intertwined his fingers in\r\nthe shaggy mane.\r\n\r\n“Bomba is glad that Polulu is strong again,” the lad said. “Now Polulu\r\ncan go back to his mate and tell her how he came to the help of Bomba\r\nwhen the jaguars were hungry for his life. If he had lost his life,\r\nBomba would have grieved for Polulu. Bomba will never forget his\r\nfriend. But now Bomba must go on, for he has lost much time.”\r\n\r\nThe puma whined, pressed against him, and looked up into his face as\r\nthough beseeching that he might go with him.\r\n\r\nBut Bomba shook his head sadly.\r\n\r\n“Where Bomba goes he must go alone,” he said. “The man he goes to see\r\nwould be afraid if he saw Polulu, and would tell his people to kill\r\nhim. Then Bomba’s heart would be heavy. No, Polulu cannot go. But Bomba\r\nwill come back, if it is so decreed, and then he will talk and feast\r\nwith Polulu again.”\r\n\r\nHe pointed back in the direction from which Polulu had come, and the\r\nbrute reluctantly obeyed. Bomba listened until the padding of the\r\nanimal’s feet had died away and then once more turned his face and\r\nsteps toward Jaguar Island.\r\n\r\nHe had been warned by the attack of the jaguar that he must now be\r\ndoubly on his guard. He realized that, whereas the big cats usually\r\nhesitated to attack unless they themselves were attacked or were sorely\r\npressed by hunger, here in this desolate region they would assail him\r\nboldly, fearlessly, knowing little of man and his strange powers.\r\n\r\nThe forces of the jungle would now be unleashed upon him, and in the\r\nmatter of mere physical strength they were stronger than he was. From\r\nnow on he must pit his wit against brute strength, trusting to his keen\r\nbrain to win against odds that would otherwise be overwhelming.\r\n\r\nSo, though he stepped swiftly, he stepped softly, constantly on the\r\nalert, bow and arrows, machete and revolver ready at hand in case of\r\nneed, eyes searching out every moving shadow in the underbrush.\r\n\r\nBefore long his supply of meat was exhausted, for he had had to eat\r\nfreely to maintain his strength. He hated to devote any more time to\r\nhunting than he had to, for it meant that much delay in his journey.\r\nBerries and nuts and turtle eggs helped to eke out his supplies, but he\r\nneeded meat.\r\n\r\nLuck was with him, for he killed a tapir, and this time he cured enough\r\nof the meat to last him, by his calculations, until he could reach the\r\nisland of Japazy. Now with his larder stocked, he could devote himself\r\nsolely to the one end he had in view.\r\n\r\nHis conviction never faltered that once he came face to face with the\r\nhalf-breed he would be able to get from him the knowledge he craved,\r\nprovided that Japazy had that knowledge. The possibility of a hostile\r\nreception occurred to him at times, but he dismissed it promptly. Why\r\nshould such a natural and simple request arouse Japazy’s ire? Jojasta\r\nhad told him something. Sobrinini had told him more. Why should not\r\nJapazy scatter the last shred of mystery that hung about the secret of\r\nhis birth?\r\n\r\nMusing thus, he was pushing his way through an unusually thick part of\r\nthe jungle late on the third afternoon after he had left Polulu when he\r\nstopped abruptly.\r\n\r\nA scream had halted him, a man’s scream, the scream of one in mortal\r\nagony!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nIN THE BOA CONSTRICTOR’S FOLDS\r\n\r\n\r\nUnder other circumstances Bomba might have hesitated before he rushed\r\nto the spot from which that scream proceeded. He would have feared a\r\ndecoy, a trap. But there was such genuine terror, such awful anguish in\r\nthat blood-curdling shriek that he hurried with all the speed he could\r\nmuster, unslinging his bow as he ran.\r\n\r\nIn a moment he had reached a little opening in the jungle, and his\r\nblood ran cold at the sight that met his eyes.\r\n\r\nA man, by his color an Indian, was struggling in the coils of a giant\r\nboa constrictor. His features were distorted with agony. The coils of\r\nthe great snake were wound about the man’s right arm and striving to\r\ncrush it into pulp.\r\n\r\nThe victim was tearing wildly at the snake’s body with the free arm,\r\nbut as the hand held no weapon it could make no impression. Another man\r\nwas circling frantically about the reptile, trying to get in a blow\r\nwith a knife. But he could not get near enough to slash, as the boa’s\r\nhead, reared aloft, struck viciously at him whenever he came almost\r\nwithin reaching distance.\r\n\r\nHad the snake retained a hold by its tail from the bough from which\r\nit had dropped upon its prey, the struggle would have long since been\r\nover. But the reptile had made two mistakes.\r\n\r\nIt had missed the body that it sought to enfold and, instead, had\r\nencircled the arm. And in the struggle it had lost the grip of its tail\r\nupon the bough above and had come floundering to the earth.\r\n\r\nNow the great body was lashing wildly about, the tail seeking a stump\r\nor a tree trunk on which it could get a grip. With this for purchase,\r\nit could crush its victim instantly, draw the body into its coils,\r\nsqueeze it into a shapeless mass, and then devour it at leisure.\r\n\r\nBomba sensed the situation in an instant. There was not a second\r\nto lose. Already the snake’s tail was brushing the trunk of a tree\r\nand, feeling the contact, it was pulling its victim in the required\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nBomba’s first thought was of his machete. With that he might sever the\r\nreptile’s spine and render it helpless. But he dismissed this at once.\r\nHe could not get near enough.\r\n\r\nLike a flash he raised his bow to his shoulder. He shouted, and the\r\nreptile reared its head and hissed at him viciously. That moment was\r\nenough to give Bomba the target he needed.\r\n\r\nThe bow twanged and the arrow transfixed that hideous head.\r\n\r\nThere was a fearful hissing and thrashing, the coils fell apart, and\r\nthe body of the reptile dropped to the ground. There it floundered\r\nabout for a minute or two and then lay motionless.\r\n\r\nThe man who had so narrowly escaped a horrible death had fallen to the\r\nearth and lay there in a crumpled heap.\r\n\r\nBomba jumped to his side, lifted the man’s head and supported it on his\r\nknees.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant the man’s companion sprang to offer a similar\r\nservice, and he and Bomba came face to face.\r\n\r\nThere was a gasp of astonished recognition.\r\n\r\n“Bomba!”\r\n\r\n“Neram!”\r\n\r\nBomba found himself looking into the eyes of Neram, one of the two\r\nslaves he had rescued from the tyranny of Jojasta on his memorable\r\nvisit to the Moving Mountain.\r\n\r\nThe delight of Neram at the meeting was unbounded, and that of Bomba\r\nwas scarcely less great.\r\n\r\nFollowing Bomba’s rescue of Sobrinini, the ex-slaves had begged to be\r\npermitted to go with him to Pipina’s cabin. Bomba had assented, and\r\nthey had proved of great value in replenishing the food supplies of the\r\nlittle household as well as in helping Pipina take care of Casson and\r\nSobrinini.\r\n\r\nLater on, when the half-demented old woman had wandered away into the\r\njungle, Bomba had sent Ashati and Neram to hunt for her, as they were\r\nskilled in all the lore of the jungle. They had gone on their search\r\nreluctantly, as they had a superstitious fear of Sobrinini, whom they\r\nregarded as a witch. Weeks passed by and lengthened into months with\r\nno word either of Sobrinini or of the ex-slaves. Bomba had reluctantly\r\ncome to the conclusion that they had perished. And now, in this most\r\nunexpected manner, he had come upon them again!\r\n\r\nThere was little time at present for explanations, for Ashati demanded\r\nall their attention. The man had fainted from fright and pain. Neram\r\nran to get some water, while Bomba chafed his wrists and slapped his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before, under these ministrations, Ashati opened his\r\neyes. An expression of panic came over his features as memory returned\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n“The snake! The big snake!” he shrieked.\r\n\r\n“He is dead,” replied Neram. “He will hurt Ashati no more. Bomba has\r\nkilled him.”\r\n\r\n“Bomba?” exclaimed Ashati excitedly.\r\n\r\nHe turned his head from Neram, and as his gaze fell upon Bomba such a\r\nlook of rapturous delight and doglike devotion came into his eyes that\r\nthe lad’s heart was touched.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Bomba is here,” said the jungle boy, as he put his hand\r\naffectionately on Ashati’s head. “Bomba heard Ashati scream and he came\r\nto his help. But now Ashati must let Bomba see his arm where the big\r\nsnake held him.”\r\n\r\nThe lad examined with care the man’s arm, which was black to the\r\nshoulder and swollen to nearly double its usual size. But to his relief\r\nhe established that the bone was not broken. If the snake had been able\r\nto get a tail hold the bone would have been snapped like a pipe stem.\r\n\r\nBomba and Neram bathed the arm and applied a plaster of river mud. Then\r\nthey propped the man as comfortably as they could against the back of a\r\ntree, first making a careful examination of the branches to see that no\r\nother monster lurked above.\r\n\r\n“Bomba is great,” murmured the grateful sufferer, as he looked with a\r\nshudder at the hideous body of the dead snake. “Bomba is good. There is\r\nno one so brave as Bomba in the jungle. And none can shoot as straight\r\nand kill as quickly.”\r\n\r\n“Bomba is glad that he came in time,” returned the lad gravely. “But\r\nhis arrow would have done no good if the snake had got its tail around\r\na tree. It was a foolish snake to let go of the bough. But how is it\r\nthat Ashati did not see that the snake was in the tree?”\r\n\r\n“Ashati had looked,” returned the man; “but some demon must have\r\nblinded his eyes, for he saw nothing. He was bending over to get some\r\nwood for a fire when the big snake dropped and wound itself about his\r\narm.”\r\n\r\n“Neram tried to help Ashati,” broke in Neram. “But he could not get\r\nclose with his knife. And Neram did not dare shoot his arrow for fear\r\nhe would kill Ashati. Neram cannot shoot as straight as Bomba.”\r\n\r\n“The gods have been good,” returned Bomba. “The big snake is dead. We\r\nwill eat of its flesh, for it is good. Neram will make a fire and we\r\nwill feast. Then Ashati and Neram will tell Bomba where they have been\r\nand what they have done since they left the cabin of Pipina.”\r\n\r\nIn a short time the fire was blazing and the choicest portions of the\r\nsnake were being roasted. They ate in silence, as is the custom of the\r\npeople of the jungle, and it was only when their appetites were fully\r\nsatisfied that Bomba spoke.\r\n\r\n“Tell Bomba now,” he commanded, “where have been the comings and goings\r\nof Ashati and Neram since they left the cabin of the good squaw Pipina.\r\nThey went to look for Sobrinini. Did they find her?”\r\n\r\n“Neram and Ashati did not find her,” replied the former. “There was no\r\nsign of Sobrinini in the jungle. There were no footprints. She must\r\nhave melted into air. She could have done this, for she was a witch.”\r\n\r\n“She was a witch,” echoed Ashati, making a cabalistic sign to ward off\r\nevil spirits.\r\n\r\n“Ashati and Neram talk foolish words,” replied Bomba impatiently.\r\n“There is no such thing as a witch.”\r\n\r\nThe ex-slaves were silent but by no means convinced. Superstition was\r\nwoven into the very warp and woof of their natures.\r\n\r\n“If Ashati and Neram could not find Sobrinini,” went on Bomba, after\r\na moment of meditation, “why did they not come back to the cabin of\r\nPipina and tell Bomba?”\r\n\r\n“They wanted to come,” replied Neram, “but Neram was taken sick with\r\nfever in the jungle, and it was many weeks before he was strong enough\r\nto walk. And then Ashati’s leg was hurt in a fight with a jaguar that\r\nhe killed. Ashati and Neram are on their way now to Pipina’s cabin. And\r\nBomba will go with us. That is good.”\r\n\r\n“No, Bomba will not go,” replied the lad. “He is going on a long\r\njourney. And Ashati and Neram will not find the cabin of Pipina. It is\r\ngone.”\r\n\r\n“Gone?” his hearers exclaimed simultaneously.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” returned Bomba. “The headhunters burned it with fire.”\r\n\r\n“The headhunters!” cried Neram, a shudder going through him at the\r\nmention of the dread name.\r\n\r\n“May the curse of the gods rest upon them!” growled Ashati.\r\n\r\n“And the good Casson? And Pipina?” asked Neram anxiously. “Are they\r\nhurt? Did the headhunters carry them away?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied Bomba. “Pipina got away, and Bomba has taken her to the\r\ncamp of the good chief, Hondura. But Casson wandered away into the\r\njungle. Bomba has looked hard for him, but could not find him. Now the\r\nbucks of Hondura are looking for Casson.\r\n\r\n“Now listen well to the words of Bomba,” he continued. “Ashati and\r\nNeram will go to the maloca of Hondura. They are good hunters, and the\r\nchief will be glad to have them among his bucks. They will tell Hondura\r\nthat Bomba has sent them and that they will hunt for Casson and make\r\ntheir home with Hondura till Bomba gets back.”\r\n\r\n“Neram and Ashati will do what Bomba says,” returned the former. “But\r\nBomba speaks of a long journey. Where is it that Bomba goes?”\r\n\r\n“Bomba goes to see Japazy, the half-breed, who lives on Jaguar Island,”\r\nthe lad replied.\r\n\r\nThe ex-slaves shuddered at Bomba’s words. Their features became livid\r\nwith fear.\r\n\r\n“Jaguar Island!” exclaimed Ashati.\r\n\r\n“To go to Jaguar Island is death,” declared Neram solemnly.\r\n\r\n“That is what Neram and Ashati said before when Bomba went to the\r\nisland of snakes to find Sobrinini,” replied the lad. “But Bomba did\r\nnot die.”\r\n\r\n“To go to Jaguar Island is death,” repeated Neram stubbornly.\r\n\r\n“They are foolish words that Neram speaks,” said Bomba. “There is death\r\nin many places, and Bomba has faced it often. He will face it again, if\r\nit is at Jaguar Island. But why is Neram so afraid that his blood is\r\nlike water in his veins? Is it because of the jaguars? Bomba has his\r\nbow and his machete.”\r\n\r\n“The arrow is swift and the knife is sharp,” murmured Neram in a\r\nsingsong voice. “But there are things that the arrow cannot pierce and\r\nthe knife cannot bite.”\r\n\r\n“What things?” asked Bomba, with a tinge of skepticism in his tone.\r\n\r\n“Ghosts,” said Neram.\r\n\r\n“Demons,” added Ashati.\r\n\r\nDespite himself, Bomba was impressed by the utter conviction expressed\r\nby the two. This was what Hondura had said. Was there indeed some\r\nfoundation for the dread that seemed to seize everybody at the mention\r\nof Jaguar Island?\r\n\r\n“Bomba has never seen a ghost or a demon,” the lad said, with an\r\nattempt at lightness.\r\n\r\n“But they have seen him,” returned Ashati, with a shiver. “Perhaps they\r\nare looking at Bomba now.”\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the ex-slaves glanced about affrightedly at the darkening\r\nshadows of the jungle and Bomba felt as though cold water were\r\ntrickling down his spine.\r\n\r\n“If there are ghosts and demons there, how is it that Japazy still\r\nlives?” he objected.\r\n\r\n“Because he is a man of magic,” replied Neram. “He is more powerful\r\neven than was Jojasta.”\r\n\r\n“He is the lord of ghosts and demons,” declared Ashati. “They do his\r\nbidding.”\r\n\r\nAgain that chill ran along Bomba’s spine.\r\n\r\nWhat was it that Neram had said?\r\n\r\n“Things that the arrow cannot pierce and the knife cannot bite!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nEYES THAT GLARED\r\n\r\n\r\nWith an exclamation of impatience, Bomba broke the spell that was\r\nstealing over him and leaped to his feet.\r\n\r\n“Bomba will go!” he cried, and his vibrant voice rang out like a\r\nchallenge through the jungle. “Is Bomba a woman to listen to such\r\nthings and tremble? Shall he whimper as the monkey whimpers when he\r\nhears the roar of the jaguar? No! Bomba will go. He will face the\r\njaguars. He will face the ghosts. He will face the demons. Bomba has\r\nspoken!”\r\n\r\nAshati gave vent to a wailing cry and Neram covered his face with his\r\nhands. In their superstitious fancy Bomba was already as good as dead.\r\n\r\n“Bomba is brave,” Ashati moaned, “but it is not well to brave the\r\nthings that come from another world.”\r\n\r\n“Bomba’s life is his own,” returned the lad. “He does with it as he\r\nwills. He would rather die than have it said that Bomba was afraid.”\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a time following his declaration. The ex-slaves\r\nwere wrapped in gloom. They loved Bomba, and would have given their\r\nlives for him. But they knew the boy well enough to be sure that he\r\nwould not recede an inch from the plan that he had formed.\r\n\r\nBomba himself was thinking deeply. It had been in his mind to ask\r\nAshati and Neram to accompany him. The loneliness of his days and\r\nnights was wearing upon him. It would be good to have companionship,\r\nsome one to whom he could talk at times and unburden his heart. Then,\r\ntoo, Ashati and Neram were skilled in woodcraft and could be of service\r\nto him in this wild and unknown part of the country.\r\n\r\nBut he dismissed the thought almost as soon as it came to him. He did\r\nnot want to drag them into danger. It was his own personal errand on\r\nwhich he was going, and he himself must face all that was involved in\r\nit. He knew that they would go if he asked them, even though they felt\r\nsure that they were going to their death. There was no limit to their\r\ndevotion. But he would not accept the sacrifice.\r\n\r\nSomething of what he was thinking must have been felt by them, for\r\nAshati came to him, prostrated himself on the ground and put Bomba’s\r\nfoot upon his neck.\r\n\r\n“Ashati will go with Bomba,” he said. “Bomba is Ashati’s chief. Twice\r\nhe has saved Ashati’s life. His life belongs to Bomba.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” put in Neram, “we will follow Bomba even to the land of ghosts\r\nand demons.”\r\n\r\nThe lad was profoundly touched, for he knew that each believed that he\r\nwas signing his own death warrant.\r\n\r\n“Ashati and Neram are good, and Bomba will not forget,” he said. “But\r\nwhere Bomba goes he must go alone. And now Bomba has spoken, and there\r\nis no need for more words about his going. But it may be that Ashati\r\nand Neram can tell Bomba some good words about the trail and what he\r\nmust do to get to Jaguar Island when he reaches the great water.”\r\n\r\n“Ashati and Neram have never been in that part of the jungle,” said the\r\nlatter. “But they have heard about it from the old men of the tribe.\r\nIt is two days’ journey beyond the Giant Cataract that Bomba must go\r\nbefore he reaches the great water. Then he must get a canoe or a raft\r\nand let the water carry him where it will. He will not need a paddle,\r\nexcept to steer, for the water is very strong and it will carry him\r\nuntil he touches Jaguar Island.”\r\n\r\nAgain a shudder stole through Neram as he mentioned that sinister name.\r\n\r\nAshati added further details of the journey, and by the time the\r\nconference was finished Bomba had gained a great deal of information\r\nthat would be of service to him.\r\n\r\n“It is well,” said the lad. “And now it is time that we sleep, for\r\nBomba must start as soon as the sun comes up in the sky. We will gather\r\nwood and make a great fire to make the beasts afraid, and then we shall\r\nrest.”\r\n\r\nHe proposed that they should take turns in watching, lest the fire\r\nshould go down. But Neram would not hear of this. That much at least he\r\ncould do for his master. He would watch through the whole night so that\r\nBomba could get the rest he needed for the task that lay before him.\r\nAnd finding that Neram was so much in earnest, Bomba did not protest.\r\n\r\nThe boy slept as soon as his head touched the ground, and did not wake\r\ntill he felt Neram’s hand upon his shoulder at the first streak of dawn.\r\n\r\nThe faithful ex-slave had composed a savory stew, and they all ate\r\nheartily. Ashati’s arm, though still painful, was much better, and a\r\ngreat deal of the swelling had gone down.\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Bomba, as he made a last examination of his weapons,\r\n“it is time for Bomba to go. He will think often of Ashati and Neram\r\nand will be glad that they are in the maloca of the good chief Hondura.\r\nThey will be good to Pipina and bring her much meat. And they will try\r\nto find Casson. If they do find him, Bomba’s heart will be more glad\r\nthan it has been for many moons.”\r\n\r\n“Neram and Ashati will do what they can to find Casson,” promised the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\n“And they will give much meat to the medicine man so that he may pray\r\nto his gods for Bomba,” added Ashati.\r\n\r\nWith a last wave of the hand, Bomba left them, and they stood looking\r\nafter him until the jungle swallowed him up. Then, with heavy hearts,\r\nthey took the backward trail to Hondura’s camp.\r\n\r\nBomba went on at a good rate of speed. The sound sleep that he had\r\nenjoyed had recuperated him immensely. Thanks, too, to the explicit\r\ninformation he had got from the ex-slaves, he now moved with more\r\ncertainty directly toward his goal.\r\n\r\nHe grieved for Sobrinini, for, though he had no deep affection for the\r\nold woman, she had been kind to him. Then, too, she had been a sort of\r\nslender link between him and the parents he had never known well enough\r\nto remember. Sobrinini had known them and had sought to tell Bomba\r\nabout them, but the twist in her poor brain had made it impossible. She\r\nhad, however, given him the clue to Japazy as possessing the knowledge\r\nhe sought, and for this Bomba was grateful.\r\n\r\nMuch more than for Sobrinini did he sorrow for Casson. Dear old Casson\r\nhad been a part of his life. It was hard to think of existence without\r\nhim. And he had been white, so different from the brown-skinned natives\r\nwith their ignorance, their superstition, their narrowed lives.\r\n\r\nWhite! That was the most precious word in Bomba’s limited vocabulary.\r\nFor it marked him out as different from the forms of life by which he\r\nwas surrounded. He wanted to be different. He wanted to be like Gillis\r\nand Dorn, the white rubber hunters, the men who laughed and slapped\r\neach other on the back. There was little laughter in the jungle. Bomba\r\nwanted some companion, some one with whom he could laugh, whom he could\r\nslap on the back. Some one like Frank Parkhurst, who had seen so much,\r\nwho had told him about the great ocean, of mighty cities.\r\n\r\nHe thought of the promises of the rubber hunters and the Parkhursts\r\nthat they would come back and take Bomba from the jungle. No doubt they\r\nhad been sincere enough at the time, but many moons had passed now with\r\nno word from them. Perhaps they had been killed by savages or wild\r\nbeasts before they got back to the coast.\r\n\r\nMore likely, Bomba thought, with a tinge of bitterness, they had\r\nforgotten him.\r\n\r\n“After all,” he said to himself, “what is Bomba but a thing of the\r\njungle? They would be ashamed to show him to their white friends. And\r\nyet that thing of the jungle saved their lives. Bomba’s knife was\r\ngood when they needed it. Bomba’s arrows were good. But now they have\r\nforgotten him as the jungle forgets the mists after the sun has risen.”\r\n\r\nBut into these gloomy ponderings shot a gleam of hope. Japazy still was\r\nleft! He might tell him of his parents, who they were and where they\r\nlived. If he did, Bomba would search out those parents, even if they\r\nwere at the other end of the world. How glad he would be to see them!\r\nAnd how glad they would be to see him!\r\n\r\nBut would they be glad? Or would they, too, be ashamed of Bomba, the\r\nboy of the jungle, the boy of the puma skin, the boy who tore his food\r\nwith his fingers when he ate, the boy who had shyly watched Gillis and\r\nDorn at their meals and wished that he could eat as they did.\r\n\r\nBut no! That lovely woman who had smiled down at him from the picture\r\nin the hut of Sobrinini, if she were indeed his mother, would not be\r\nashamed of Bomba. She would gather him to her heart. She would kiss\r\nhim, as the woman with the golden hair had kissed him when he had saved\r\nher from the headhunters of Nascanora.\r\n\r\nFor some time past, as he journeyed on engrossed in thought, Bomba had\r\nbeen conscious of a rumbling in the distance. It was so far away that\r\nhe had paid little attention to it. Now it had grown louder, and it\r\nforced itself upon his attention.\r\n\r\nWas it thunder? The sky was azure and the sun was shining with dazzling\r\nbrilliance. The sound could not be thunder.\r\n\r\nThen the truth broke upon Bomba. It was the roar of the Giant Cataract!\r\n\r\nThat mighty body of water was miles and miles away, but the sound\r\ncarried far in the clear air.\r\n\r\nBomba was perhaps twenty miles to the left of it. Now he hastened to\r\nmake the distance still greater. For at the Giant Cataract was the\r\nvillage of Nascanora, he whose nose Bomba had crushed, he who was\r\nreserving a special place on the top of his wigwam for the head of the\r\njungle boy who had shamed him before his followers and defied him.\r\n\r\nBomba described a wide semicircle that would bring him to the river\r\nhe sought many miles above the Giant Cataract. He had little fear of\r\nmeeting any headhunters in the district toward which he was heading,\r\nfor they were probably imbued with same superstitious fear of Japazy\r\nand Jaguar Island that had possessed Ashati and Neram, and would give\r\nthe region a wide berth. Still, it was well to take no chances, and he\r\ndrove from his mind for the moment all thoughts of his parentage and\r\ndevoted himself strictly to the matter in hand.\r\n\r\nBy the evening of the next day, he figured, he would reach the river\r\nbank. Then he would make his raft and launch himself into the unknown.\r\nThe strong current of the river would carry him along to Jaguar Island.\r\n\r\nTo what else? To the knowledge that he craved? Or to death?\r\n\r\nIf the former, he would be supremely happy. If the latter--well, Bomba\r\nhad known how to live. He would know how to die.\r\n\r\nAs the shades of night were drawing on he came to an old ramshackle\r\nnative hut, long since abandoned. There was no door. Only the four\r\nwalls were standing, and they were bending crazily.\r\n\r\nEven at that, however, it offered more protection than that to which\r\nthe lad had been accustomed. He could build a big fire before the door\r\nof the hut. That would protect him on one side, and the walls would\r\nshelter him on the other three sides from the incursions of serpents\r\nand wild beasts.\r\n\r\nHe had had a hard, exhausting day and was very tired. He built his\r\nfire, brought water from a little stream near at hand, made a native\r\ntea from bitter leaves he gathered and feasted heartily upon the tapir\r\nmeat, of which he had yet a considerable store on hand.\r\n\r\nThen he lay down to sleep on the earthen floor of the hut. His tired\r\neyes closed almost instantly.\r\n\r\nHow long he slept he did not know. But he was awakened at last by a\r\nqueer sensation, as though he were rocking up and down in a canoe.\r\n\r\nHis first thought was of earthquake. It was a common enough occurrence\r\nin that district, which had once abounded in volcanoes, most of them\r\nnow extinct.\r\n\r\nBut there was no roar or rumbling, such as usually accompanied a quake.\r\nThere was no sound save the usual buzz and hum of the jungle.\r\n\r\nBomba sprang to his feet, every sense on the alert.\r\n\r\nBeneath the place where he had been lying the earthen floor was heaving\r\nlike the waves.\r\n\r\nThen it broke apart, and from the shattered opening rose a great head\r\nwhose open jaws were armed with terrible rows of teeth.\r\n\r\nBomba looked into the fiery eyes of a monster alligator!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE RUSHING RIVER\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a moment the lad stood as though turned into stone, astounded and\r\nappalled. Then he realized what had happened.\r\n\r\nThe alligator, following a custom of its kind, had buried itself in\r\nthe soft mud, on the same principle that a bear hibernates in winter.\r\nProbably a flood some time before had inundated the district and the\r\nalligator had come with it. When the flood receded the alligator had\r\nremained in its self-imposed burial place. The soft mud had caked and\r\nhardened, but still the alligator slept on.\r\n\r\nThe weight and warmth of the boy’s body had aroused it, and now it was\r\nissuing forth to renew once more its active life.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the great brute seemed as much surprised as the lad\r\nhimself, and looked stupidly at the invader of its retreat.\r\n\r\nBut only for a moment. Then a hideous bellow issued from its open jaws,\r\nits fiery eyes snapped with malignity, and it made a lunge at the\r\njungle boy.\r\n\r\nBut the lunge was an instant too late.\r\n\r\nFor Bomba had shaken off the paralysis that the sight of the monster\r\nhad brought upon him, and with one bound had cleared the doorway,\r\nleaping high over the fire that blazed in front of the hut.\r\n\r\nWith speed incredible in so clumsy a creature, the alligator pursued\r\nhim. But it could not leap like Bomba, and with the torpor of its long\r\nsleep confusing it and the light of the fire blinding it, plunged\r\nheadlong into the flames.\r\n\r\nThere was a tremendous bellowing and thrashing about, a scattering\r\nof the embers in every direction, and then the half-blinded creature\r\nlumbered out and made for the jungle, forgetting in its own pain and\r\nbewilderment all about its human enemy.\r\n\r\nBomba had not the slightest desire to hinder its going. He probably\r\ncould have slain it with one of his arrows, but he forbore, glad enough\r\nto be rid so suddenly of an awful problem.\r\n\r\nBut there was no more sleep for him that night. He had been too\r\nthoroughly shaken. He made up the fire again and sat down beside\r\nit, keeping a careful watch lest the monster, still lurking in the\r\nvicinity, should return to take vengeance on the author of its\r\nmisadventure.\r\n\r\nBut nothing happened during the remainder of the night, and at the\r\nfirst streak of dawn Bomba made a hasty breakfast and set out once\r\nmore on the trail.\r\n\r\nThe jungle thinned as he went on, and he was able to make such rapid\r\nprogress that it was only a little after noon when he reached the banks\r\nof the great river in which somewhere was Jaguar Island.\r\n\r\nIt was a black, ominous stream, with a current that ran like a\r\nmill-race. At intervals along its length were foaming rapids that made\r\nnavigation extremely perilous. Islands dotted its expanse here and\r\nthere, but none of these within Bomba’s sight were of any great size.\r\n\r\nWhere Bomba stood the river was about half a mile in width, but a\r\nlittle further down it expanded to more than twice that width. Great\r\ntrees fringed the banks, the foliage reaching far out over the water.\r\n\r\nBomba hunted the banks for a long distance on the chance that he might\r\nfind the canoe of some Indian, either abandoned or hidden in the sedge\r\ngrass near the shore. He was an expert in navigating that type of\r\ncraft, and would have felt much safer in it than on a raft that would\r\nbe wholly at the mercy of the torrent.\r\n\r\nBut, search as he would, he could find no craft of any sort, and when\r\nhe had fully convinced himself that there was no other alternative, he\r\nset to work to build his raft.\r\n\r\nThere were plenty of fallen trees and broken branches that had been\r\nvictims of one of the storms that had swept the jungle, and the boy\r\nhad little difficulty in getting enough of the right size and shape of\r\nlogs to make the raft he had in mind. It was not to be an elaborate\r\nstructure, but it must be strong, for upon its stability his life might\r\ndepend.\r\n\r\nHe had no implements of any kind, except his machete. He had no nails\r\nor hammer with which to fasten a flooring to the logs to hold them\r\ntogether. But there was an abundance of withes and creepers that,\r\ntwisted together, were as strong as any rope, and these he wound about\r\nthe logs in such a way that they could not break loose from one another.\r\n\r\nIt did not add to his peace of mind to note from time to time an\r\nalligator’s body break the water. Sometimes they sank again after a\r\nlazy glance. More often they swam around sluggishly, watching Bomba\r\nwith their little eyes as though calculating how long it would be\r\nbefore he could be depended on to furnish them a meal. It was evident\r\nthat the river was fairly swarming with the terrible creatures.\r\n\r\nBut these were foes that could be reckoned with, foes that were not\r\nimmune from arrow and knife. They were different from ghosts and\r\ndemons, those vague, shadowy, yet awful things of which Hondura, Neram\r\nand Ashati had spoken.\r\n\r\nWere there any such things? Bomba did not believe there were. Still,\r\nhe would have given a great deal to have been perfectly sure on that\r\npoint. And almost involuntarily at times his eyes would wander to the\r\nsurrounding jungle.\r\n\r\nAfter two days’ labor his work was done, and he surveyed it with\r\nsatisfaction. It was as nearly square as he could make it and\r\nsufficiently large so that it would not easily overturn. In addition to\r\nthe raft, he had shaped a rough paddle for his steering and a long pole\r\nto work the raft loose, if it grounded in a shallow.\r\n\r\nHe had been working close to the edge of the bank, and when the raft\r\nwas completed he pushed it over into the water. Then he jumped on board\r\nand, standing near the front with the paddle in his hand, committed\r\nhimself to the mercy of the current.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon when he started, so late, in fact, that he\r\nwas almost tempted to wait till the following morning. But now that he\r\nwas so near the completion of his journey the urge in him to hurry was\r\ntoo strong to be resisted.\r\n\r\nThe moon was full and would rise early, and from this he would get all\r\nthe light he needed.\r\n\r\nThe current was stronger than he had thought, and the clumsy raft was\r\nborne along upon the surface at a surprising rate of speed. At times\r\nit was caught in a cross-current and whirled about, and Bomba had all\r\nhe could do to keep his balance. And it was extremely desirable that he\r\nshould keep his balance. It would not do to be thrown into the water.\r\n\r\nFor Bomba had not started alone. A grim retinue accompanied him. As he\r\nhad conjectured, the river was alive with caymans. Some were swimming\r\nalong behind him, their greedy eyes fixed unblinkingly upon the daring\r\nyoung voyager. Others came to the surface as his raft was carried along\r\nand joined in the procession. Once let Bomba get in the water, and he\r\nwould be torn to pieces in a twinkling.\r\n\r\nNo one knew this better than the lad himself, and every nerve in his\r\nbody was at its extreme tension.\r\n\r\nNot only from his foes in the water was he in danger. At times the\r\ncurrent swept him in so close to the shore that he passed under the\r\nbranches of the overhanging trees. These, too, he had to scan, lest any\r\ninnocent looking bough should suddenly come to life and prove to be the\r\nbody of an anaconda ready to dart down like lightning upon its prey.\r\n\r\nOnce he came to a rapids where the churning water made all attempts\r\nto steer impossible, and his raft was tossed about like a chip. One\r\nsudden heave threw Bomba to the floor of the raft, and he all but slid\r\ninto the water. But he caught his hands in the crevices of the logs and\r\nheld on for dear life.\r\n\r\nAnd now he noted that the alligators were closing in upon him. They\r\nwere growing impatient. Hitherto, they had been content to follow the\r\nraft, expecting every moment that the craft would be upset. But as time\r\npassed and this did not happen they became more ugly and aggressive.\r\n\r\nOne of them swam under the raft and then rose suddenly, lifting it on\r\nits back, almost upsetting it. The raft rose to a perilous angle, but\r\nrighted just in time and fell back with a splash into the water.\r\n\r\nThe ruse had not succeeded, but there was little doubt that it would be\r\nrepeated, and Bomba concluded that it was time to teach his enemies a\r\nlesson.\r\n\r\nHe selected the largest of the alligators, and, reaching for bow and\r\narrow, took careful aim at one of its eyes. The arrow went straight to\r\nthe reptile’s brain. Its dying flurry churned the water into foam, but\r\nbefore the body could sink half a dozen of its mates were upon it.\r\n\r\nIn a minute they had torn the body into fragments and the water was red\r\nwith blood. The monsters sank to the bottom to regale themselves.\r\n\r\nThe killing of the cayman helped Bomba in more ways than one. It not\r\nonly reduced the number of his enemies, but it kept the others busy\r\nwith the feast that its body provided. Moreover, it taught the brutes\r\nthat the boy was not as helpless as they had supposed, and they were\r\nlikely to be a trifle more wary and cautious in future.\r\n\r\nWhile the caymans were disposing of their booty, the swift current had\r\ncarried Bomba a long distance ahead. His eyes strained through the\r\ngathering darkness, but he could see nothing of his former pursuers. He\r\nhoped that he had shaken them off.\r\n\r\nVain hope! For in a little while he could see phosphorescent gleams in\r\nthe water behind him that he knew marked the trails of the caymans.\r\n\r\nThey were coming again. Their appetite for blood had not been satiated.\r\nRather it had been whetted.\r\n\r\nThey wanted Bomba! And they were determined to have him!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nJAGUAR ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nDespite his iron courage, Bomba could not repress a shudder.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, he still had his bow and arrows, and what he had done once\r\nhe might do again.\r\n\r\nBut now he was handicapped by the darkness. It had come on swiftly.\r\nIt would be almost half an hour before the moon would rise. And how\r\ncould he shoot in the darkness at such a tiny target as the eye of the\r\nalligator?\r\n\r\nFor he must kill it there or nowhere. Against the tough, scaly armor\r\nthat covered the brute from snout to tail, fifty arrows might strike as\r\nharmlessly as hail on a roof.\r\n\r\nHe strained his eyes through the darkness ahead, hoping to see some\r\nstill blacker blot that might betray the presence of land. He felt that\r\nby now he must be somewhere in the vicinity of the island of the big\r\ncats. Whatever danger awaited him there, he would face gladly rather\r\nthan endure the fate that threatened him from the waters in his wake.\r\n\r\nThose phosphorescent streaks were drawing closer now. One in particular\r\nwas not more than twenty feet away.\r\n\r\nThen there came a rush, and a huge alligator hurled itself out of the\r\nwater and came down with half its body on the raft. Its open jaws\r\nsnapped at Bomba’s legs.\r\n\r\nQuick as lightning, Bomba grabbed the long pole, and with all the\r\nstrength of his muscular arms rammed it down the monster’s throat.\r\n\r\nThe brute slid off the raft into the water, and instantly its comrades\r\nwere on it like a pack of wolves.\r\n\r\nRelieved of its burden, the raft righted and swung ahead in the\r\ncurrent. A moment later it came up against a jutting point of land with\r\na shock that almost jarred Bomba off his feet.\r\n\r\nBut he caught hold of an overhanging branch and held the raft steady.\r\nGradually he pulled it in until it grounded on a shelving beach.\r\n\r\nStill maintaining his hold on the bough with one hand, Bomba took from\r\naround his neck where he had wound it a strong rope of creepers and\r\nfastened the raft to the bough so that it could not drift away. Then he\r\nleaped to shore.\r\n\r\nHe threw himself on the ground at full length, panting and exhausted.\r\n\r\nLand! To feel the solid earth beneath him after the nightmare of that\r\nawful journey through the seething waters. Now let the alligators\r\nrage! He had cheated them on their own element.\r\n\r\nBut had he cheated them? He must not grow careless. The alligators\r\ncould travel on land as well as in the water. They were close at hand,\r\nand one or more might come creeping up the bank.\r\n\r\nSo, tired as he was, he got to his feet and made his way cautiously\r\ninland until he came to a thorn thicket, into which he burrowed, not\r\nwithout scratches on arms and legs. But what were scratches to one who\r\nhad escaped the jaws of the caymans?\r\n\r\nWas he on Jaguar Island? Or had he struck a smaller island? Ashati and\r\nNeram had told him of one that stood in the river two miles above the\r\nisland of the big cats. Perhaps it was this one on which his raft had\r\ngrounded.\r\n\r\nHe need not wait long to know. The moon would soon be up, flooding all\r\nthe world with light. Then he could make a survey of his surroundings\r\nand get his bearings.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, rest was unspeakably sweet. The terrific strain under\r\nwhich he had been during that perilous journey down the river had\r\ntested his strength and endurance to the uttermost. Now he relaxed.\r\n\r\nBut he did not sleep. For, if he were not already on Jaguar Island, he\r\nstill had a trip to make that night. He had vowed to himself that he\r\nwould not sleep until he had reached the island where Japazy dwelt.\r\nThen only would he lie down to slumber.\r\n\r\nPerhaps to the slumber that knows no waking! He knew that, too. But the\r\npossibility did not for one moment swerve him from his purpose.\r\n\r\nA little while later a faint light came flickering in among the trees.\r\nThe moon was rising. Bomba waited for a few minutes more and then\r\nemerged from his shelter and looked about him.\r\n\r\nA little scouting showed him that he was not on Jaguar Island. There\r\nwas no semblance of human habitation of any kind. The island was only a\r\nfew acres in extent, and in a little while he had walked all around it.\r\n\r\nOnce more he would trust himself to the swift turbulent river.\r\n\r\nHe came to the place where his raft was swinging in the sedge grass\r\nnear the shore. His eyes scanned the river anxiously. But there were no\r\nmore of those streaks of phosphorescence in evidence. The alligators\r\nhad waited for a while perhaps, angry and disappointed, and then\r\nreturned sullenly to their usual haunts.\r\n\r\nTo be sure, others might come and take their places, but as Bomba knew\r\nthat the brutes usually slept at night he did not apprehend much danger\r\non that score.\r\n\r\nHe unlashed the raft from its mooring and with a hard push of his\r\npaddle sent it out from the shore, where it was promptly caught in the\r\ngrip of the current.\r\n\r\nNow he was on the last lap of his journey, the journey that had taken\r\nhim so many weary days, that had been so full of peril and adventure,\r\nand during which his life had so many times seemed to depend upon the\r\nturning of a hair.\r\n\r\nWas not the very fact that he had been so preserved, Bomba asked\r\nhimself, a proof that the gods of the Indians, in whom he half\r\nbelieved, were on his side? Surely he could not have come so far only\r\nto be mocked at last at the very moment when the end of his mission was\r\nin sight.\r\n\r\nFrom these reflections Bomba derived what comfort he could, while his\r\nkeen eyes scanned the tumbling waters ahead of him and darted from\r\nshore to shore.\r\n\r\nPresently he became conscious of an odd humming sound, as of the\r\nbuzzing of innumerable bees. In fact, he thought that a hive might be\r\nswarming from one side of the river to the other, and looked to see if\r\nhe could detect the presence of the insects in the moonlight. Then he\r\nremembered that the bees swarmed only in the daytime.\r\n\r\nNow the noise took on a deeper note, and with the humming were mingled\r\ndiscordant notes, rumbling notes, ominous notes, with an occasional\r\ncrash as of faraway thunder.\r\n\r\nSomething like this Bomba had heard on his visit to the Moving\r\nMountain. At that time they had been a prelude to a frightful\r\nearthquake. Was anything of that kind threatening now?\r\n\r\nWhile he was seeking some solution, his eyes caught sight of a light\r\non the river ahead of him. He thought at first it might be a torch in\r\nthe canoe of some native. But if that had been so, it would have moved\r\nsteadily in one direction.\r\n\r\nInstead, it leaped about irregularly as though a sport of the wind and\r\nwaters. Then it disappeared altogether.\r\n\r\nNow other lights, some faint, some bright, began to stud the surface of\r\nthe stream. There were many of them, and they flared up and went out\r\nas though at the caprice of a magician. All the time the humming sound\r\npersisted.\r\n\r\nBomba began to feel the hair slowly rising on his head. This\r\ntranscended anything in his experience. He recalled the warnings of\r\nHondura, of Neram and Ashati. Was he entering a realm of spirits, of\r\nmalignant ghosts and demons? Were they even now laughing in glee as\r\nthey saw the young voyager coming within their reach?\r\n\r\nSo engrossed was he in these eerie imaginings that for a moment his\r\nvigilant watch of the course he was taking lessened. He was brought\r\nto a rude sense of reality when his raft struck violently on a rock\r\nthat protruded above the boiling foam of a rapid, so violently that it\r\nbroke apart, the tough withes that bound it snapped by the force of the\r\nimpact.\r\n\r\nThe next moment Bomba found himself struggling in the waters of the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nHe rose to the surface and shook the spray from his eyes. In the\r\nchurning waters he could see the separated logs of the raft tossing\r\nabout in wild confusion. He grasped one of them and hung on desperately\r\nuntil the current carried him and his slender support into the\r\ncomparatively quiet waters beyond.\r\n\r\nThen he climbed up on the log and sat on it astride.\r\n\r\nHis mind was a welter of conflicting thoughts and emotions. In a moment\r\nthe whole outlook had changed. He had been in comparative safety as\r\nlong as the raft was beneath his feet. Now he was a mere floating\r\nderelict, unable to shape his course, powerless to use his weapons if\r\nhe were assailed.\r\n\r\nThe other logs were tossing about in dangerous proximity. At any moment\r\none of them might be hurled against him, breaking a leg or knocking him\r\nsenseless.\r\n\r\nAnd the caymans!\r\n\r\nHe looked behind him fearfully. But there were none of those\r\nphosphorescent streaks to betray the presence of the monsters. How long\r\nwould it be, however, before there would be a break of the water and\r\nthe emerging of the hideous head of one of the lords of the river!\r\n\r\nSitting astride the log, his legs were hanging in the water. One bite\r\nof the alligator’s jaws and a leg would be severed as though shorn by\r\nshears.\r\n\r\nBut he was nearing land. That was one comfort. Before him in the\r\nmoonlight he could see a black mass rapidly taking shape. By its size\r\nand general contour, as given him by the ex-slaves, he conjectured that\r\nit must be the island of the big cats.\r\n\r\nHe drifted nearer and nearer to it. Now he was not more than a hundred\r\nfeet away. Bomba braced himself for the jar that would come when the\r\nlog struck the shore. Once more he looked behind.\r\n\r\nThat look almost made his heart stop beating.\r\n\r\nHe saw a phosphorescent streak!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE HIDDEN LISTENER\r\n\r\n\r\nBomba knew all too well what that phosphorescent streak meant. An\r\nalligator was coming, and coming fast.\r\n\r\nBomba measured the distance between himself and the shore. The log\r\ncould move no faster than the current. But Bomba could!\r\n\r\nIn an instant he had dived into the water and struck out for the shore.\r\n\r\nHe could swim with amazing speed, and he had never put such power into\r\nhis strokes as he did now. He knew that he was racing for his life.\r\nWould the start he had prove sufficient to bring him to the shore\r\nbefore he was overtaken by his terrible pursuer?\r\n\r\nIt probably would not have been, if the monster had not stopped for\r\nan instant and nosed about the log. It was there its eyes had last\r\ndescried the boy, for Bomba had been swimming under water since he had\r\nslipped off like a shadow.\r\n\r\nThat moment of puzzlement on the part of the reptile proved the boy’s\r\nsalvation. For by the time Bomba’s almost bursting lungs compelled him\r\nto come to the surface for air, he found himself within a few strokes\r\nof the shore.\r\n\r\nThe alligator detected him and put on a tremendous burst of speed. But\r\nit was under too great a handicap. Bomba reached the bank and pulled\r\nhimself up just as the alligator made a snap at him and missed.\r\n\r\nBomba rose to his feet, his heart swelling with jubilation.\r\n\r\nBut that jubilation was swiftly turned to horror.\r\n\r\nAs he drew the air into his gasping lungs and turned from the shore,\r\nthere came a tremendous roar and the lad found himself looking into the\r\nfiery eyes of a jaguar crouched for a spring.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to fit an arrow to the bow, not even time to draw the\r\nmachete from its sheath, for even as Bomba’s startled mind grasped the\r\nsituation, the beast launched itself into the air.\r\n\r\nLike a flash Bomba dropped flat to the ground.\r\n\r\nHe felt the rush of air as the brute passed over him. The next instant\r\nBomba was on his feet and had drawn his knife, ready for the return\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nBut there was no need. They had been so close to the bank that the\r\nspring of the brute had carried it over the edge and into the water. It\r\ncame up sputtering and strangling and started to scramble up the bank.\r\n\r\nThen came a rush, a scream of mortal agony, and the jaguar was\r\nstruggling in the jaws of the alligator!\r\n\r\nThe great beast fought desperately, tearing with teeth and claws\r\nagainst the scaly hide of its captor. But the alligator was in its\r\nfavorite element and had the advantage. Clamping the jaguar in its\r\ngreat jaws, it went down under the surface. There was a churning of the\r\nwater that rapidly turned red, a few bubbles of air rose to the top,\r\nand then the commotion subsided.\r\n\r\nThe lord of the jungle had met more than his match in the lord of the\r\nriver!\r\n\r\nScarcely daring to believe in his escape, Bomba watched the turbulent\r\nwater in a horrid fascination. Two terrible perils, one from the land,\r\none from the water, had vanished almost in the twinkling of an eye.\r\n\r\nHe had reached his destination. He was on Jaguar Island. He was\r\nunscathed. Surely the Indians’ gods--or some power higher than his\r\nown--must be on his side when one of his enemies was made to destroy\r\nthe other. The conviction gave him renewed strength and courage.\r\n\r\nHe found a thorn thicket, forced his way into it, and sat down to take\r\ncounsel with himself as to his future course.\r\n\r\nHe had formed no clear idea as yet as to how he would approach Japazy.\r\nHe had deferred thinking of that until he should have reached the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nOne thing was certain. He must not seek him at night. In the darkness\r\nand the confusion that his unexpected coming might produce it might\r\nvery well happen that he would be killed before his peaceful intentions\r\ncould be explained. It was the law of the jungle to shoot first and\r\ninvestigate afterward.\r\n\r\nNo, he must go in the daylight, with his palms extended outward as a\r\nsign of amity and goodwill. Then he would be brought into Japazy’s\r\npresence and would explain his errand. Then he would listen to the\r\nwords that would give him the information for which his soul yearned or\r\nelse doom him once more to heartache and despair.\r\n\r\nHe looked at the sky and judged the time from the position of the moon.\r\nIt was not yet midnight. He would have some hours in which to get the\r\nrest that he so sorely needed. Then at the first streak of dawn he\r\nwould be astir, would go scouting cautiously about the island and find\r\nout the dwelling place of Japazy and his people. After that he could\r\ndecide how to approach the half-breed.\r\n\r\nThe mysterious humming mixed with louder and more discordant notes\r\nstill persisted. Bomba glanced riverward and saw the flickering lights\r\ndancing weirdly on the surface. What did they mean? What did they\r\nforebode?\r\n\r\nHe looked about the jungle. In the faint moonlight that filtered\r\nthrough the trees the things he saw took on fantastic shapes. The\r\ncreepers hanging from the trees swayed and writhed and seemed to\r\nstretch out ghostly arms. The knots and boles of the trunks framed\r\nthemselves into grimacing faces that seemed to be chuckling over the\r\nfate of the young invader who had come unbidden into their realm.\r\n\r\nWith an effort Bomba shook himself free from the morbid fancies that\r\nwere stealing upon him.\r\n\r\n“Is Bomba an old woman?” he asked himself scornfully. “Will he be\r\nwhimpering soon like Pipina, the squaw? No! Bomba does not fear what\r\nthe natives fear. He does not tremble like Ashati and Neram who talk\r\nfoolish words about ghosts and demons. For Bomba is white. He is like\r\nGillis and Dorn, who laugh at the talk of ghosts. If they can laugh, so\r\ncan Bomba. For Bomba has a white skin and he has a white soul, and he\r\nis afraid of nothing that the foolish people say walk in the darkness.”\r\n\r\nStrengthened in his own mind by this defiance, he took food from his\r\npouch and made a hearty meal. Then he burrowed still further into the\r\nheart of the thicket, where, knowing that no wild beast would attempt\r\nto get at him, he lay down and slept.\r\n\r\nThe first faint light of day was creeping up the sky when he awoke.\r\nHe made a hasty breakfast, and then, after looking closely to the\r\ncondition of his weapons, set out on his voyage of discovery.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before he discovered that the island was many acres\r\nin extent. Much of it was jungle, almost as thick in places as on the\r\nmainland. But it was much easier to traverse, for there were numerous\r\nwell-beaten trails extending in various directions which attested the\r\npresence of quite an island population.\r\n\r\nThere were sections also on which grew little vegetation. These were\r\nsandy and rocky plateaus, seamed with ravines. There was one great hill\r\nthat almost rose to the dignity of a mountain, and from this a bluish\r\nvapor or smoke kept constantly rising and spreading out in the shape of\r\na fan. At times a flash of flame would issue forth from the summit.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of this, Bomba frequently felt slight tremors of the\r\nearth, one of them so pronounced that it nearly threw him from his\r\nfeet. And the humming was much louder here than it had been when Bomba\r\nwas on the river.\r\n\r\nBomba knew that he was in a volcanic region, and the discovery did\r\nnot contribute to his peace of mind. The terrible scenes that had\r\nattended the eruption of the Moving Mountain and the earthquake that\r\nhad accompanied it were still too fresh in his memory not to stir him\r\nunpleasantly in retrospect.\r\n\r\nAt almost every moment Bomba expected to come upon some hut or village\r\nin the jungle. From the inhabitants of these, he had planned to get\r\ninformation as to the village or town in which Japazy dwelt. But though\r\nhe saw once in a while some ramshackle cabin, it proved invariably\r\nto be deserted. In some places the lush vegetation of the jungle had\r\nalmost overgrown the hut. No beaten path led to the door. Not the\r\nrudest of native furniture was within.\r\n\r\nAfter two or three experiences of this kind Bomba grasped the\r\nsituation. The jaguars that had given the island its name must abound\r\nin such numbers that no solitary dweller in the jungle would be safe.\r\nProbably every one of these deserted cabins had been the scene of a\r\ntragedy. Undoubtedly the inhabitants had had to gather into one town\r\nfor mutual protection.\r\n\r\nBomba thanked his stars that it was daylight and that most of the\r\nnocturnal prowlers had retired to their dens where they would sleep the\r\nday away in preparation for the next foray. But all the same, there\r\nmight be one or more about, and he kept a vigilant eye upon every tree\r\nand thicket.\r\n\r\nHe had searched about for perhaps three hours when he heard the twang\r\nof a bow string. With it was blended a roar of rage and pain. Then\r\nfollowed an excited babbling of voices.\r\n\r\nThe sound had come from the further side of a group of rocks that\r\nseemed to have been thrown about in confusion by some convulsion of\r\nnature. They were not more than fifty yards away.\r\n\r\nWith the speed and at the same time the stealthiness of a panther,\r\nBomba glided to the biggest group of bowlders. He squeezed himself in a\r\ncrevice between two of them.\r\n\r\nNow he could hear the voices of two natives talking vociferously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nDISCOVERED\r\n\r\n\r\nBomba edged himself still further between the bowlders until he found a\r\nplace where he could look through without himself being seen.\r\n\r\nAt once he saw the reason of the excitement.\r\n\r\nA dead jaguar lay stretched out on the ground. One arrow protruded from\r\nits side. Another was imbedded in its throat.\r\n\r\nTwo natives were inspecting it and gloating over their kill. They were\r\nvigorous and stalwart specimens, somewhat above the usual size of\r\njungle dwellers. Their faces were savage, but not so brutish as those\r\nof the headhunters of Nascanora. They were unclothed, save for the\r\ncustomary breech clout. On their broad breasts was painted a tribal\r\nemblem that Bomba had never seen, and a band about the forehead of each\r\nheld a cluster of nodding plumes.\r\n\r\nWhile the language in which they spoke had some words that were\r\nunfamiliar to Bomba, he was so well versed in most of the dialects\r\nof the jungle, which differ little, that he had no trouble in\r\nunderstanding what they were saying.\r\n\r\n“The aim of Sunka is true,” boasted one, as he bent over the dead beast\r\nand proceeded, with the aid of his knife to get the arrow from its\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\n“No truer than that of Boshot,” retorted the other, as he sought to\r\nreclaim his arrow from the body. “See how it went through from side to\r\nside!”\r\n\r\n“The jaguar is brave, but he is not so brave as the fighting men of\r\nJapazy,” went on Sunka, as he examined his arrow, dried it and returned\r\nit to his quiver.\r\n\r\n“His leap is as the lightning, but when the arrow sings he falls,”\r\nadded Boshot. “I see Olura, Tama and Abino coming,” he went on, as he\r\nlooked toward a trail at his right.\r\n\r\n“They have heard the jaguar roar and they come to help,” declared\r\nSunka. “But there is no need of help when Sunka and Boshot have fitted\r\ntheir arrows to the string.”\r\n\r\nIt was in this self-congratulatory mood that the victors welcomed the\r\nthree newcomers whom Bomba could now see issuing from the jungle path.\r\n\r\nThere were loud cries of satisfaction as the trio discovered the dead\r\nbody of the jaguar.\r\n\r\n“Japazy will be glad when he sees its head!” exclaimed Olura, as he\r\nsurveyed the animal.\r\n\r\n“Whose arrow killed it?” asked Tama.\r\n\r\n“Mine,” declared Sunka proudly.\r\n\r\n“Mine,” stated Boshot with equal conviction.\r\n\r\nThey glared at each other in defiance, and their hands involuntarily\r\ngripped more tightly the spears that they carried in addition to their\r\nbows and arrows.\r\n\r\n“There is no need of bad blood and hot words between Sunka and Boshot,”\r\nintervened Abino, who seemed to be much older than the others and\r\nsomething of a diplomat. “All Japazy’s people know how brave they\r\nare. What matter which arrow did the killing? Neither might have done\r\nso without the other. Japazy will be pleased with Sunka and Boshot.\r\nBut his eyes will shoot lightning at either one, if he fight with the\r\nother.”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” put in Tama. “There are too few of our people now since\r\nthe plague came some moons ago. That plague carried many to the place\r\nof the dead. The tribe needs all its fighting men to kill jaguars and\r\nnot to kill each other.”\r\n\r\nThe hands of the would-be combatants loosened from their spears and\r\ntheir anger disappeared. Bomba guessed that the most potent argument\r\nhad been the mention of the lightning that would flash from Japazy’s\r\neyes. It was evident from the reverence with which they pronounced the\r\nname of the chief that they held him in awe.\r\n\r\n“The jaguar is dead, and that is good,” said Abino. “But there are\r\nstill many left. We kill many, but more come. And there are cubs in\r\nthe caves that will soon be big enough to carry off the children of the\r\ntribe.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” agreed Olura, with despondency in his tone. “Two more were\r\ncarried off last week. The medicine men make prayers, but still the\r\njaguars come.”\r\n\r\n“They come from the other shore,” observed Abino. “They swim the river\r\nin the night when the caymans are asleep. There are herbs on the island\r\nthat they like, that make them laugh when they are sad, that make them\r\nwell when they are sick.”\r\n\r\nBomba guessed that they referred to a kind of catnip that he had\r\nalready noted growing on the island in great profusion. He wondered\r\nthat the natives had not torn these up by the roots, so as to make the\r\nplace less alluring to the unwelcome visitors. Then, realizing the rank\r\nand rapid growth of the vegetation, he knew that nothing less than an\r\narmy could accomplish the colossal task.\r\n\r\n“It would be well if Japazy would take his people to the other side of\r\nthe river where the jaguars are not so many and where the tribe could\r\ndwell in peace,” remarked Boshot.\r\n\r\n“Beware, Boshot,” warned Abino, looking fearfully about him. “Remember\r\nyou not Manasta, he of the bold and forward tongue? He said one day to\r\nJapazy the words that just now came from Boshot’s mouth. Japazy looked\r\nat him and his frown was terrible. And Manasta has not been seen since\r\nthat day.”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” put in Tama, in an awed voice. “It is said that Japazy\r\nhad him tied and put in a bag and thrown into the river to the caymans.\r\nSo beware, Boshot. They are good words that Abino has spoken to Boshot.”\r\n\r\nThe doughty warrior, who had not quailed before the charge of the\r\njaguar, seemed to shrink into himself, and Bomba had a new glimpse into\r\nthe ruthless character with whom he was soon to deal.\r\n\r\n“Now let us skin the jaguar and get his meat,” suggested Olura. “There\r\nis but little food in the huts of our people, and they will be glad and\r\nmake a feast when they see us bringing them the meat of the jaguar.”\r\n\r\nThey were preparing to carry out the suggestion when there was a sharp\r\nreport. A burst of flame sprang out of the mountain’s top, and the\r\nearth shook so violently that all of the natives measured their length\r\nupon the ground. Bomba would have been thrown also, had it not been for\r\nthe rocks on either side. As it was, he was knocked about until he was\r\nbruised and sore.\r\n\r\nThe natives scrambled to their knees and bowed their heads to the\r\nground, making cabalistic signs and uttering entreaties either to the\r\nmountain or their gods.\r\n\r\nThe trembling of the earth persisted for several minutes and then\r\nsubsided. But it was some time before the natives had so far recovered\r\nfrom their fright as to set about resuming the skinning and cutting up\r\nof the dead jaguar.\r\n\r\n“Tamura is angry,” murmured Abino, looking up fearfully at the mountain\r\npeak, from which smoke and flame were still issuing. “We must make him\r\ngifts, many gifts, so that he may smile again upon our people.”\r\n\r\n“We will give some of this meat to the medicine man so that he may make\r\na burnt offering,” suggested Tama. “Else the lava floods may come and\r\nroll over the dwelling place of the tribe.”\r\n\r\nAs though to accentuate this possibility, there came another shock more\r\nviolent than the one before.\r\n\r\nThe rocks between which Bomba was standing were pulled apart as though\r\nby giant hands, and to the startled eyes of the Indians Bomba stood\r\nrevealed!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nIN THE HANDS OF THE TRIBE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effect created by the sudden appearance of Bomba was startling.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the savages gaped at him in stupefaction, eyes bulging,\r\njaws dropped. Then some of them raised their spears and others hastily\r\nfitted arrows to their bows.\r\n\r\nBomba had been almost as disconcerted by his sudden betrayal as the\r\nnatives themselves. But now, as steadily as the tremulous motion of the\r\nearth would permit, he stepped boldly out of his former hiding place\r\nwith hands up and palms extended, as a token that he came in amity and\r\ngoodwill.\r\n\r\nThe sign was one that was understood by all tribes that dwelt in the\r\njungle, and the threatening motions ceased. Spears and bows were\r\nlowered and the natives stood looking at him in wonder. His bronzed\r\nskin was almost as dark as theirs, but they knew by his features that\r\nhe belonged to a different race.\r\n\r\nNot a word was uttered until Abino, who seemed to be the spokesman of\r\nthe group, took a step forward.\r\n\r\n“Who is the stranger?” he asked. “Why has he come to the island of\r\nJapazy?”\r\n\r\n“It is Bomba who speaks,” replied the lad. “He comes from a far part of\r\nthe jungle and he would speak to Japazy, your chief. He comes in peace.\r\nHis heart is clean and he does not speak in forked words.”\r\n\r\n“It is well that the stranger comes in peace,” returned Abino, “for the\r\nspears of Japazy’s fighting men are sharp and their arrows sing with\r\njoy when they sink into the heart of an enemy.”\r\n\r\n“Huh!” grunted Boshot. “The men of Japazy would not waste an arrow on a\r\nboy.”\r\n\r\nThe slur stung Bomba, but he knew the importance of keeping his temper,\r\nand no change of expression was visible in his face. Still, he thought\r\nit might be just as well to let them know at the outset that though he\r\nwas a boy he was no weakling.\r\n\r\n“Bomba is but a boy,” he admitted, with an ingratiating smile. “But\r\nBomba has the muscles of a man. He will show you.”\r\n\r\nHe walked up to the dead jaguar, put his arm under it, and with one\r\nmighty heave threw it over his shoulder.\r\n\r\nThere were excited exclamations among the Indians, and they shrank\r\nback, looking at Bomba in awe. Not one of them, despite their size,\r\ncould have performed the feat so easily, if at all.\r\n\r\n“The stranger is strong,” admitted Abino, and Boshot looked rather\r\nsheepish because of his slighting remark.\r\n\r\nBomba noted the impression that had been produced and thought it an\r\nopportune time to deepen it still further.\r\n\r\n“Bomba is no weakling,” he said; “but the weapons he carries with him\r\nare stronger than Bomba. His arrows go far and they go straight. They\r\nfind the eye of the cayman and the heart of the jaguar.”\r\n\r\n“The stranger speaks big words,” retorted Sunka skeptically.\r\n\r\nBomba looked about him. At a distance of two hundred feet was a high\r\ntree, on the topmost branch of which a buzzard was preening itself.\r\n\r\n“The buzzard is far away,” he said, as he fitted an arrow to his\r\nstring, “but he will fall when Bomba lets go the string.”\r\n\r\nThere were grunts of incredulity mingled with curiosity. This stranger\r\nwas giving them thrills to which they were unaccustomed.\r\n\r\n“Shall Bomba’s arrow strike the body or the neck?” asked Bomba with a\r\nshow of indifference.\r\n\r\n“Now we know that the stranger boasts,” broke in Tama. “If he hit the\r\nbody, he will do well.”\r\n\r\n“It will be the neck,” declared Bomba.\r\n\r\nThe arrow sang through the air and the buzzard fell, transfixed by the\r\narrow lodged in its neck.\r\n\r\nAgain there was an outburst of excited exclamations. The natives had\r\nnever seen such shooting.\r\n\r\n“That is but little,” said Bomba, satisfied with the impression he had\r\nproduced. “Bomba has a fire stick in his pouch that speaks with the\r\nvoice of thunder, and when it speaks something dies. But he will not\r\nshow it now.”\r\n\r\nThe Indians looked at him with awe. Gone was the half contempt with\r\nwhich they had at first regarded him. No such boy had ever been seen\r\nin those parts before. In their superstitious minds was the vague,\r\nconfused impression that perhaps he was one of the gods.\r\n\r\n“Bomba would see Japazy,” went on the lad. “He has come from a far\r\ncountry to speak with him. Perhaps the warriors of his tribe will show\r\nBomba where the chief dwells?”\r\n\r\nThey looked at each other questioningly.\r\n\r\n“He is a bold man who would speak with Japazy,” said Abino. “Japazy\r\ndoes not like strangers. Some have been cast on the island from the\r\nriver, and they have never gone back to speak of the island of the big\r\ncats. They have gone to the place of the dead.”\r\n\r\nThis had not an auspicious sound, and Bomba for a moment felt an\r\nuncomfortable chill creeping up his spine.\r\n\r\n“Bomba has no evil thought in his mind,” the lad rejoined. “He does\r\nnot seek any of Japazy’s goods, and he will not say anything that will\r\nbring harm to Japazy or his people. He would only ask a question of\r\nJapazy.”\r\n\r\nHis hearers still looked extremely dubious, and Bomba thought that he\r\ncould detect pity in some of the glances directed toward him.\r\n\r\n“It is not for Japazy’s people to know what is in the mind of their\r\nchief,” said Abino. “Japazy does as he wills and his words mean life or\r\ndeath.”\r\n\r\n“He will speak life for Bomba,” replied the lad, with an assumption of\r\nconfidence that he was a long way from feeling. “Will Japazy’s fighting\r\nmen take Bomba to their chief?”\r\n\r\nThey drew apart and conferred together. It was evident that even this\r\nsimple request required thought before it could be granted. Bomba could\r\nsee that, if Japazy resented his coming, his wrath might fall upon\r\nthose who had brought the unwelcome stranger to his presence instead of\r\nkilling him on the spot.\r\n\r\nThere was an animated discussion that at times almost reached the\r\ndimensions of a quarrel. But at last they came to a conclusion and\r\nAbino turned toward Bomba.\r\n\r\n“The stranger shall go to Japazy,” he announced. “But he must have his\r\nhands bound so that he may do no harm to Japazy or his people.”\r\n\r\nBomba took a step backward.\r\n\r\n“Bomba is free,” he said proudly. “It is not meet that he have his\r\nhands bound as though he were a slave. His hands will do no hurt to\r\nJapazy or the people of his tribe. Bomba’s heart is good. Has he not\r\nsaid that he came in peace? May the curse of the gods rest on Bomba, if\r\nhe means harm.”\r\n\r\nHis earnestness seemed to make an impression, but still the tribesmen\r\nhesitated.\r\n\r\n“The stranger then must give up his bow and his knife and the fire\r\nstick that speaks with the voice of thunder,” suggested Abino, as a\r\ncompromise.\r\n\r\nBut Bomba shook his head.\r\n\r\n“The bow, the knife and the fire stick are Bomba’s friends,” he\r\ndeclared. “Without them he would be like a man without arms and legs.\r\nThey will do harm to no one but the wicked. Bomba will keep his\r\nfriends.”\r\n\r\nThey could have fallen upon him and overpowered him by sheer weight\r\nof numbers. But they had seen a demonstration of his skill and knew\r\nthat he would take toll of some of them before he succumbed. Any one\r\nwho could shoot a buzzard through the neck at two hundred feet and\r\nsling a jaguar over his shoulders, was to be treated with respect. And\r\ndoubtless the mention of the fire stick that spoke with the voice of\r\nthunder had been extremely potent.\r\n\r\nAgain there was a discussion and again the Indians yielded the point in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n“It shall be as the stranger wills,” announced Abino. “The warriors of\r\nJapazy will skin the jaguar and take its meat and then they will lead\r\nthe stranger to the place where Japazy dwells.”\r\n\r\n“It is well,” said Bomba, with more relief than he allowed to appear.\r\n“The men of Japazy have good hearts.”\r\n\r\nThe men set to work on the jaguar, and Bomba helped them. The dexterity\r\nand sureness with which he wielded his knife contributed still further\r\nto the respect the Indians had conceived for him.\r\n\r\nWhen the work was finished the men lifted up their respective burdens\r\nand led the way, with Bomba bringing up the rear. He did not think\r\nthat any treachery was intended, for Abino, somehow, had given him an\r\nimpression of sincerity. But he was on the alert and ready for instant\r\naction at any suspicious movement, for his life in the jungle had\r\ntaught him to take no chances.\r\n\r\nNothing untoward developed, however, and before long they came to the\r\nstraggling outskirts of a village that seemed to have a considerable\r\npopulation. From every hut, as the little procession moved along,\r\npeople poured out with exclamations of curiosity as they stared at the\r\nstranger who should have been a captive and yet walked behind the rest\r\nmore with the air of a conqueror.\r\n\r\nMost of the houses were of the usual native cabin type, but in the\r\ncenter of the town was a building of so much greater pretensions that\r\nBomba concluded it must be the dwelling of Japazy.\r\n\r\nAbino led Bomba to a little cabin not far from the palace, if it could\r\nbe dignified by that name, and left him there with the promise that he\r\nwould see Japazy and return.\r\n\r\nHe did return in less than five minutes.\r\n\r\n“Japazy is gone!” he declared abruptly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nDAZZLING TREASURE\r\n\r\n\r\nSomething like a stab pierced Bomba’s heart when he heard Abino make\r\nthe announcement that Japazy was gone.\r\n\r\n“Gone?” he cried, springing to his feet. “Japazy gone? Has Bomba come\r\nso far through the jungle only to find that Japazy is not on the island\r\nof the big cats? Where has he gone? When will he be back?”\r\n\r\n“Abino does not know,” was the answer. “Japazy goes when and where he\r\nwill. He does not ask counsel of the elders of the tribe. It is enough\r\nthat he wants to go. But he does not stay away long. The stranger will\r\nhave to wait.”\r\n\r\n“Has he gone away from Jaguar Island, or is he going about among his\r\npeople in the other villages?” asked Bomba.\r\n\r\n“There is no village but this,” replied Abino. “Once there were many on\r\nthe island, but the big cats have come and killed so many of the people\r\nthat they have all come together in this place so that they will be\r\nsafe. The big cats do not come where they are so many fighting men.\r\nNo, Japazy is not on the island. He has gone away over the water.”\r\n\r\nThe sunken city of which Hondura had spoken came into Bomba’s mind.\r\n\r\n“Is it that he has gone to the place where stood the city that had\r\ntowers of gold?” he asked.\r\n\r\nA startling change came into Abino’s tone and manner. His glance seemed\r\nto bore Bomba through and through.\r\n\r\n“What foolish words are these that the stranger speaks?” he demanded\r\nsharply. “There is no city that has towers of gold. It is not well to\r\nask too many questions. Men have asked questions of Japazy, and he has\r\ncut out their tongues. If the stranger is wise, he will let others\r\nspeak while he listens. Abino has spoken.”\r\n\r\nBomba realized that he had touched upon a forbidden subject. For some\r\nreason, the sunken city was a secret that was jealously guarded. He\r\nresolved to be discreet.\r\n\r\n“Abino speaks wise words,” he said placatingly. “Bomba will keep them\r\nin his heart. He will wait in patience till Japazy returns.”\r\n\r\n“That is well,” returned Abino, mollified. “Bomba shall have food and\r\ndrink and none shall harm him. And he shall have a place to sleep in\r\nthe house of Japazy until the chief comes back from his journey. Bomba\r\ncan come now and Abino will take him to the place where he shall stay.”\r\n\r\nBomba rose and followed his guide. His appearance outside was again the\r\nsignal for an outpouring of the curious. There had been time now for\r\nthe warriors who had first met this stranger to spread abroad the story\r\nof his strength and skill, and there was manifest respect in the fact\r\nthat, while they followed him, they were careful not to come too close.\r\nWho of them knew but that this youth who boasted of a fire stick that\r\nspoke like thunder might be a god?\r\n\r\nUnder other circumstances Bomba’s pride would have been gratified\r\nby this tribute. But his whole thought was centered now on the\r\ndisappearance of Japazy. This had not entered into his calculations. He\r\nbitterly regretted that he had not come sooner. Suppose Japazy never\r\ncame back? Life was a precarious thing in this part of the world.\r\nUsually it hung by a thread. The bite of a snake, the spring of a\r\njaguar, and Japazy’s lips might be sealed forever. Then Bomba’s last\r\nhope of learning the secret of his parentage would have vanished.\r\n\r\nThe crowd halted at the entrance to Japazy’s great dwelling. Evidently\r\nit was forbidden ground except to the chosen few, such as Abino, who,\r\nas Bomba learned later, was Japazy’s chief counselor and who had charge\r\nof all matters pertaining to the tribe during his master’s absence.\r\n\r\nFollowed by Bomba alone, Abino led the way through a massive door, well\r\nfurnished with bars and bolts to protect its owner in case of invasion\r\nor revolt. And once inside, Bomba saw a sight that fairly dazzled him.\r\n\r\nHe had never been in any house but a native hut, with its rude and\r\nscanty furniture. He had expected to see something more elaborate\r\nin the dwelling of Japazy. But he was by no means prepared for the\r\nsplendor that burst upon him.\r\n\r\nThere were objects here that might have graced any palace in Europe.\r\nBeautiful paintings hung on the walls. Sumptuous rugs covered the\r\nfloors. Splendid chairs and divans were scattered here and there.\r\nSilken tapestries hung as portières at the entrances of various rooms\r\nthat opened from the main hall. There were statues of marble, tables\r\ncunningly carved and inlaid with gold and precious stones, curious\r\nmedallions and intaglios, suits of armor and swords of the finest\r\nsteel, a vast number of objects of art of all kinds scattered about in\r\nprofusion.\r\n\r\nBomba had never seen anything of the kind, never dreamed of them, never\r\nknown that they existed. It was as though he had been translated to\r\nanother world.\r\n\r\nWhere had these things come from? How had they been secured?\r\n\r\nThen light flashed upon Bomba. They must have come from that city of\r\nwhich Hondura had spoken, the city whose very towers had been of gold!\r\nSomehow, Japazy had found access to that city--or what was left of it.\r\nNo wonder that he guarded his secret so jealously!\r\n\r\nBomba had no knowledge of values. He had never seen money. But he\r\nknew vaguely that here was something infinitely precious, infinitely\r\ndesirable. And the white blood in him, with its inheritance of taste\r\nand culture and love of the beautiful, as well as the little knowledge\r\nof wider things that Casson, before that devastating gun explosion, had\r\ngiven him, told him that he was in a treasure house.\r\n\r\nWere things like these, he asked himself, the things that white people\r\nhad in the homes and cities that Frank Parkhurst had told him about?\r\nWere they things that he, Bomba, might have, if he were living with the\r\nrace to which he belonged?\r\n\r\nHe stole a glance at Abino. The savage was standing there stolidly,\r\nindifferently, in a bored attitude. Bomba sensed that the man had not\r\nthe slightest appreciation of the beauty by which he was surrounded. He\r\nhad the soul of a native of the jungle, incapable of being touched by\r\nanything but the most primitive needs of life.\r\n\r\nBut why should Japazy then appreciate and collect them? The\r\nexplanation dawned on Bomba. Japazy was a half-breed. Some of his blood\r\nwas white. And Sobrinini had known Japazy when they were both parts\r\nof that faraway country where the white people dwelt. So Japazy had\r\nlearned what beauty was, and the part of him that was white had yearned\r\nfor these things! He had gathered them from the sunken city, where once\r\na great civilization had flourished, and had furnished his dwelling\r\nwith the splendor of the distant white civilization.\r\n\r\nBomba felt an increased respect for the chief he had come to see. Part\r\nof the blood, anyway, of this man was white. And were not all white men\r\nbrothers? Would not Japazy feel a touch of kinship and give him freely\r\nthe information that he sought?\r\n\r\nIt never occurred to Bomba that in giving Japazy credit for taste and a\r\nlove of beauty for its own sake he might be paying too high a tribute\r\nto the half-breed. That the latter should be collecting these things\r\nfor mercenary purposes with the design, when he should have enough, of\r\nshipping them overseas and selling them at fabulous prices, and then\r\nfollowing them to live for the rest of his life in wealth and luxury\r\namid the civilization whose value he knew, did not enter Bomba’s mind.\r\n\r\nIn the center of the largest room stood a platform covered with a\r\ncloth of scarlet and gold, and on this was a great carved chair that\r\ndoubtless served Japazy as a throne. Bomba could figure the half-breed\r\nsitting there, stern and commanding, clothed in gorgeous raiment the\r\nbetter to emphasize the distance between him and his dependents who\r\nbowed cringingly before him.\r\n\r\nAbino seemed to realize what Bomba was thinking, and he answered the\r\nunspoken question.\r\n\r\n“It is from here that Japazy rules his people,” said Abino in tones of\r\nreverence. “Here he speaks the words that mean life or death. It is\r\nhere that the stranger will stand when he is brought in to where Japazy\r\nwaits to hear him.”\r\n\r\nWords that mean life or death! Which of the two would they mean to him,\r\nBomba wondered.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said Abino, “and Abino will show you the place where you are to\r\nstay.”\r\n\r\nHe led him to a room at some distance from that large central hall and\r\nmotioned him to enter.\r\n\r\nIn contrast to the other room, it was very simply and plainly\r\nfurnished. Still, it was in the style of the white people, with chairs\r\nand table, a rug on the floor and a bed with a mattress, sheets and\r\ncoverings.\r\n\r\nBomba felt strange and abashed. He had never sat on a chair, never\r\nslept in a bed. But he restrained his feelings in the presence of\r\nAbino. After all, he was white, and his heart swelled at the thought.\r\nThis would be his chance to do as white folks did, sit on a chair,\r\nsleep in a bed, try to imagine by so doing that he was getting a little\r\ncloser to his own people for whom his heart yearned. When he did find\r\nthem he did not want to have them ashamed of him.\r\n\r\n“It is in this room that people stay who come from afar to have talk\r\nwith Japazy,” Abino remarked. “Some of them, after he has heard their\r\nwords, go away again. But some do not go away.”\r\n\r\nThe last words had an ominous ring and were not calculated to add to\r\nBomba’s peace of mind. But he gave no sign, and a look of admiration\r\nthat the native could not repress came into Abino’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“The stranger is brave,” he said. “His arms are strong and his eye is\r\nstraight. Abino does not forget how the stranger slung the jaguar over\r\nhis shoulder and how he shot his arrow through the neck of the buzzard\r\non the top of the tall tree. But it is not enough for one who stands\r\nbefore Japazy to have strong arms and a straight eye. He must have a\r\nheart that does not tremble.”\r\n\r\n“Is Japazy then so terrible?” asked Bomba.\r\n\r\n“The stranger shall see for himself,” answered Abino. “Japazy’s eyes\r\nshoot lightnings. His voice is like the thunder. No arrow can pierce\r\nhim, no knife can bite him. For he has ghosts and demons that obey his\r\nwords. They turn aside the arrows. They dull the edge of the knife. But\r\nit is not well to talk of Japazy. The stranger will rest here and Abino\r\nwill send him food. Then, after he has eaten, the elders of the tribe\r\nwill come and talk with him.”\r\n\r\n“They are good words that Abino speaks,” answered the lad. “Bomba will\r\nbe glad to talk to the elders of the tribe and tell them why he has\r\ncome to Jaguar Island.”\r\n\r\nAbino withdrew, and Bomba welcomed the chance to be alone. He had been\r\nunder a terrific strain, mentally and physically. Now he could relax\r\nfor a while before he had to brace himself again for the interview that\r\nwas coming.\r\n\r\nHis eyes, glancing around the room, caught sight of a picture on the\r\nwall. At the sight his heart almost leaped from his body.\r\n\r\nThe pictured face of the portrait was that of the same lovely woman who\r\nhad looked down at him from the portrait in the dwelling of Sobrinini!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE DEEPENING MYSTERY\r\n\r\n\r\nWith one bound Bomba was across the room and looking at the picture\r\nwith all his soul in his eyes.\r\n\r\nYes, it was the same beautiful face, girlish and appealing, the soft\r\nhair waving back from the broad forehead, the half-smiling lips, the\r\neyes that were dark and melting. And the eyes looked down at him now\r\nas they had looked at him in the hut of Sobrinini, full of love and\r\ntenderness, while the lips seemed ready to murmur words of endearment.\r\n\r\nWhat chords of memory did that face stir in Bomba’s heart? What\r\nrecollections, faint and dim as some far off strains of music, were\r\ntugging at his consciousness? What vague memory told that desolate lad\r\nthat he was looking at the pictured face of his mother?\r\n\r\nHis mother! The mother who perhaps had sung to him the lullaby that\r\nSobrinini had crooned, who once perhaps had caressed him, kissed him,\r\ncalled him Bonny, her Bonny!\r\n\r\nA passion of tears welled to the boy’s eyes. His heart was stirred to\r\nits depths.\r\n\r\nBut he dashed the tears away. A native might enter at any minute and\r\nmight attribute them to weakness, to fear at the situation in which he\r\nfound himself. Above everything, he must remain master of himself.\r\n\r\nHow came that picture in the dwelling of Japazy, the half-breed? Why\r\nhad a similar picture been in the hut of Sobrinini? What mysterious\r\nlink was there between the lovely original of that picture and\r\nSobrinini, the witch woman, Japazy, the master of Jaguar Island,\r\nJojasta, the medicine man of the Moving Mountain, and Casson, his\r\nfriend and former protector? Somewhere, some time, those residents of\r\nthe Amazonian jungle had known the mysterious Bartow, his wife, Laura,\r\nand perhaps the little child named Bonny. How had fate brought them\r\ntogether? And how had fate torn them apart?\r\n\r\nThe door of his room opened, and a boy appeared, bringing a tray of\r\nfood. It was savory and abundant, and Bomba ate it with a relish.\r\n\r\nThe boy, who seemed to be about twelve years old, stood by, watching\r\nhim with black, beadlike eyes. Curiosity was in the eyes and awe, awe\r\nof this bold stranger, only a little older than himself in years, but\r\nvastly older in strength and experience, who had dared to take his life\r\nin his hands and come to ask questions of the dreaded Japazy, the lord\r\nof life and death on Jaguar Island.\r\n\r\n“What is your name?” asked Bomba, who took a liking to the youngster.\r\n\r\n“Thy servant’s name is Solani,” answered the boy. “He is the son of\r\nAbino.”\r\n\r\n“Solani has a good father,” said Bomba diplomatically.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” answered the boy proudly. “There is no one so wise on the island\r\nof the big cats as Abino, except Japazy himself.”\r\n\r\n“Has Solani ever seen ghosts or demons?” asked Bomba. “It is said that\r\nthere are many on the island.”\r\n\r\nThe boy looked about fearfully.\r\n\r\n“There are many here,” he answered. “They keep Japazy from harm. But no\r\none can see them except Japazy. His eyes see everything.”\r\n\r\n“Bomba saw some lights on the river,” said the jungle boy, determined\r\nto draw Solani out, for he saw that he was in a responsive mood. “Bomba\r\ndid not know but what the lights were the campfires of the ghosts.”\r\n\r\n“The lights are burning brushwood,” explained Solani. “They are thrown\r\nout from the earth when Tamura, the mountain, is angry and his anger\r\nbreaks great holes in the ground.”\r\n\r\n“Is Tamura often angry?” asked Bomba.\r\n\r\n“Many times he speaks in thunder and throws out rocks and rivers of\r\nfire that eat up whatever they touch,” replied Solani. “Tamura has\r\nkilled many of our people. The old men say that he will not be silent\r\nuntil some stranger is offered up to him. Then he will be satisfied and\r\nmake no more thunder.”\r\n\r\nAs Bomba, as far as he knew, was the only stranger at that time on the\r\nisland, there was something decidedly uncomfortable in this information.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Abino entered, followed by several old men whom Bomba\r\ntook to be the chief advisers of the tribe.\r\n\r\nAbino motioned to his son to take away the empty dishes and what food\r\nremained, and then he and his companions squatted on their haunches in\r\na semicircle and gazed fixedly at Bomba.\r\n\r\nThey said nothing, and their stare persisted so long that Bomba became\r\nrestless and himself broke the silence.\r\n\r\n“It was good of Abino to send Bomba food,” he said. “There was much\r\nfood and it was good.”\r\n\r\n“The stranger must not starve until Japazy hears what words the\r\nstranger has to say to him,” replied Abino.\r\n\r\n“They will not be many words,” replied Bomba. “They will not make\r\nJapazy shoot lightnings from his eyes. Bomba comes in peace and his\r\nwords are good words.”\r\n\r\n“What are the words that the stranger would speak with Japazy?” asked\r\none of the most aged and wizened of his visitors.\r\n\r\nBomba hesitated. Would Japazy resent his confiding his mission to any\r\none but himself?\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, he had already gotten some useful information from\r\nSolani. The mention of human sacrifices, for instance, had put him\r\non his guard, if, in the future, any such thing should be attempted.\r\nPerhaps in conversation with these elders of the tribe he might learn\r\nsomething else that might be of value to him.\r\n\r\nMoreover they had asked him the question, and any lack of frankness on\r\nhis part might deepen the suspicion they already entertained as to his\r\nmotives.\r\n\r\nHe decided to answer.\r\n\r\n“Bomba would ask Japazy who are the father and mother of Bomba and how\r\nhe can find them if they are still alive,” the lad stated.\r\n\r\nBomba caught the quick glances that passed between the Indians at this\r\nannouncement, and he was not unaware of the look that Abino flashed at\r\nthe picture of the lovely woman on the wall.\r\n\r\n“Why does the stranger think that Japazy can tell him who his father\r\nand mother are?” asked Abino, after a pause.\r\n\r\n“Sobrinini told Bomba that Japazy knew,” returned Bomba.\r\n\r\n“Sobrinini!” exclaimed one of his auditors. “She is the witch woman who\r\ndwells on the island of snakes. To go to that island is death. How,\r\nthen, does the stranger say that he has had speech with Sobrinini?”\r\n\r\n“Bomba’s tongue is not forked,” replied the lad. “Bomba went to the\r\nisland of snakes and had speech with the witch woman. Then he took her\r\naway from the island and gave her shelter in the hut of Bomba and the\r\ngood white man, Casson.”\r\n\r\n“Why did not Sobrinini tell the stranger of his father and mother?”\r\nasked his questioner incredulously.\r\n\r\n“Sobrinini tried to tell, but the gods had put clouds on her mind and\r\nshe could not see through them,” answered Bomba. “But she could see\r\nJapazy through the clouds and she said he would know. So Bomba is here.”\r\n\r\nThe promptness and sincerity of his answers evidently had some effect\r\non his visitors. They looked at each other uncertainly. Then the eldest\r\nof them spoke.\r\n\r\n“There is much gold on the island of the big cats,” he said slowly.\r\n“Strangers have come here before, and their words were as smooth as the\r\nskin of the baby and as sweet as honey in the comb. But they said one\r\nthing with their tongue and another in their heart. The demons that\r\nguard Japazy told him what word was in the stranger’s heart; and that\r\nword was gold. The strangers did not go away again from the island of\r\nthe big cats.”\r\n\r\n“Bomba has not two ways of speaking,” answered the lad. “The words from\r\nhis lips are the same as the words in his heart. Bomba does not care\r\nfor the gold of Japazy. He would not know what to do with it if Japazy\r\ngave it to him. May the gods lay their curse on Bomba if he is not\r\nspeaking from a clean heart!”\r\n\r\nAnother long pause ensued.\r\n\r\n“Is it true that the stranger does not even know the name of his father\r\nor that of his mother?” asked one of the group.\r\n\r\n“Bomba does not surely know,” returned the lad. “But when Sobrinini\r\nsaw Bomba she called him Bartow. And Jojasta of the Moving Mountain\r\ncalled him Bartow. They thought Bomba was Bartow or Bartow’s ghost. So\r\nif Bomba looked so much like Bartow, it may be that Bartow was Bomba’s\r\nfather. And Sobrinini spoke of Laura. And Casson spoke of Laura. It is\r\nin Bomba’s heart that that may have been the name of his mother.”\r\n\r\nWas it fancy, or did Abino again steal a glance at that picture on the\r\nwall?\r\n\r\n“It is well,” said the oldest of the group as he rose to his feet, an\r\nexample followed by the others. “We will think over what the stranger\r\nhas said.”\r\n\r\nThe old men went out of the room silently, in single file. But the\r\nsilence persisted only until they had gone some distance down the\r\ncorridor that led to the large hall. Then they broke out into excited\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nBomba would have given a great deal to know what they were saying, but\r\nthey were too far away for him to hear them distinctly.\r\n\r\nAfter they had gone out of the door of the building, however, their way\r\nled them under his window. They were still talking excitedly, and, as\r\nhe strained his ears, these words floated up to him:\r\n\r\n“Bartow! Was not that the name of the man Japazy killed?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nTHE CREEPING DEATH\r\n\r\n\r\nBomba, his head in a whirl, staggered back from the window when he\r\nheard the sinister words:\r\n\r\n“Was not that the name of the man Japazy killed?”\r\n\r\nWas it possible that the father whom he had sought so long was really\r\ndead? Had all his search been futile?\r\n\r\nBut the despair that this thought brought him was quickly swallowed up\r\nby another emotion. Rage, blinding rage, at the man who had killed his\r\nfather, at Japazy, the half-breed, the arrogant, heartless monster who\r\nlorded it over this ignorant people.\r\n\r\nIf this should prove true--that Japazy was really his father’s\r\nmurderer--Bomba then and there vowed vengeance. Let Japazy look to\r\nhimself! Let him gather all his ghosts and demons to protect him! They\r\nwould be of no avail. Bomba’s arrow or Bomba’s knife would find the\r\nblack heart of the half-breed! His father’s murder should be avenged!\r\n\r\nBomba knew nothing of the Christian law of forgiveness. He had been\r\nbrought up in the jungle, whose first law was self-preservation,\r\nwhose second law was vengeance for evil received. If Japazy had taken\r\nBartow’s life, Japazy’s life must pay the forfeit.\r\n\r\nOh, if Japazy were only here! Oh, if Bomba could meet him face to face\r\nand wrest the truth from him! The lad paced the room, gnashing his\r\nteeth with impatience.\r\n\r\nHis restless pacings brought him beneath the lovely pictured face on\r\nthe wall. He gazed at it yearningly. If she were his mother, perhaps\r\nshe still lived, even if his father was dead.\r\n\r\nThen another thought came to him and his rage flamed up anew. Perhaps\r\nshe, too, had fallen a victim to Japazy. The hand that slew the one\r\nmight also have slain the other. In that case, Bomba would owe a double\r\ndebt of vengeance. And he would pay that debt!\r\n\r\nOh, if he only knew!\r\n\r\nBut there was nothing he could do until Japazy returned.\r\n\r\nSuppose, however, that Japazy did not return? What if any one of the\r\nthousand perils of the jungle should cut short his life? Then perhaps\r\nBomba could never get the knowledge for which his soul panted. He\r\nwould be cheated, too, of his vengeance--supposing it were true that\r\nJapazy had indeed slain his father.\r\n\r\nEven while immersed in these gloomy reflections, a gleam of hope came\r\nto Bomba.\r\n\r\nAbino!\r\n\r\nPerhaps Abino knew. He was the chosen counselor of Japazy as far as\r\nthat haughty despot permitted any one to advise him. Perhaps he was\r\nalso the repository of Japazy’s secrets. Those quick and furtive\r\nglances that Abino had cast at the picture on the wall! What did they\r\nmean? What did Abino know?\r\n\r\nTired out finally by these ponderings and questionings, Bomba at last\r\nthrew himself on the floor and slept. And for this he chose a place\r\ndirectly beneath the picture, where those lovely, tender eyes could\r\nlook down upon him.\r\n\r\nIt was dark when he woke, and the immediate occasion of his waking was\r\nthe entrance of Solani, bringing his supper.\r\n\r\nThe boy lighted a torch and thrust it into a holder against the wall.\r\nBy its light, Bomba noted that the boy looked disturbed and frightened.\r\n\r\n“Solani is sad to-night,” observed Bomba, as he prepared to eat the\r\nmeal that the lad had set on the table. “What is it that makes the\r\nheart of Solani heavy?”\r\n\r\nThe boy looked about him carefully, and when he answered, it was almost\r\nin a whisper.\r\n\r\n“Solani grieves because he fears that harm may come to the stranger,”\r\nhe replied.\r\n\r\n“Who would bring harm to Bomba, except perhaps Japazy?” asked the\r\njungle lad. “And Japazy is not here. Unless Japazy has come since you\r\nbrought the last meat to Bomba,” he added.\r\n\r\n“Japazy is not here,” replied Solani. “But the people of the tribe are\r\nfearful of his wrath if he should come and find the stranger here. They\r\nthink that Japazy will not be glad to hear the stranger’s words about\r\nhis father and his mother. They fear that Japazy may be angry because\r\nthey did not kill the stranger as soon as he landed on Jaguar Island.”\r\n\r\nBomba’s heart sank. Was it possible that the elders, believing that\r\nJapazy had killed the boy’s father, were fearful that he had come to\r\ntake vengeance on their chief?\r\n\r\nTo be sure, he was only a boy, but he had that very day demonstrated\r\nthat he had strength, skill, and courage that any warrior of the tribe\r\nwould have found it hard to match.\r\n\r\n“It cannot be that the elders of the tribe would do harm to a stranger\r\nwho came with his palms out and put himself into their keeping,” said\r\nBomba. “That would bring on the people the wrath of the gods.”\r\n\r\n“They do not fear the wrath of the gods as much as they fear the wrath\r\nof Japazy,” returned Solani. “The gods are very far away. Japazy is\r\nnear.”\r\n\r\nNo better proof than this statement, simply made, could have been\r\nafforded of the tremendous power exercised by the crafty half-breed\r\nover the superstitious people through the strength of his personality\r\nand his talk of ghosts and demons.\r\n\r\n“What do the elders of the tribe say about Bomba?” questioned the\r\njungle lad, with an assumption of carelessness that he was far from\r\nfeeling.\r\n\r\n“They meet to-night to take counsel,” answered Solani. “Then it will\r\nbe known what they think about the stranger and what they will do with\r\nhim.”\r\n\r\n“Where do they meet?” asked Bomba, who was already forming a plan of\r\naction.\r\n\r\n“In the house of Abino, my father,” was the answer.\r\n\r\n“Is that the house where Bomba was taken before he was brought to the\r\nhouse of Japazy?” Bomba further queried.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Solani.\r\n\r\n“It is well,” said Bomba. “Their words will be good words and they will\r\ndo no harm to the stranger that came to them in peace.”\r\n\r\nSolani looked very doubtful as to that, but he said no more, and Bomba\r\nhimself did not prolong the conversation. He was too busy with his\r\nthoughts.\r\n\r\nHe could readily understand that, in order to curry favor with the\r\ntyrant, they might make a sacrifice of Bomba. It was for him to\r\nforestall this, if possible, and to learn their plans before they were\r\nput into execution.\r\n\r\n“Has the stranger ever seen a cooanaradi?” asked Solani unexpectedly,\r\nas he started to gather up the dishes and the remnants of food.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Bomba has seen them and slain them,” answered the jungle boy.\r\n“They are the most wicked snakes of the jungle. Why does Solani ask?”\r\n\r\nBut Solani acted as though he had already said too much and did not\r\nreply. He hastily finished his task and disappeared. But as he went\r\nout of the door he turned and looked once more at Bomba with a long,\r\nlingering glance as though he never expected to see him again.\r\n\r\nThe look made Bomba uneasy. What did Solani know that he had been\r\nafraid to say? That he meant to warn him to be on his guard was\r\nevident. Probably even in going that far the native lad had done what\r\nhe had been forbidden to do.\r\n\r\nBomba waited until it was fully dark. It was then within an hour of\r\nmoonrise, and darkness was needed for the plan that he had in mind.\r\n\r\nHe went stealthily through the house, examining every room by the light\r\nof the torch he had plucked from the wall. He thought that perhaps\r\nsome sentries were on guard to watch his movements. But the dwelling\r\nappeared to be deserted. It had probably been decided that any one\r\nwho had braved so many perils in coming to Jaguar Island would not be\r\ninclined to leave it before his mission had been accomplished.\r\n\r\nHaving ascertained to his satisfaction that no one was lurking in the\r\nshadows, he went back to his room and carefully examined his weapons.\r\nHaving found that they were in perfect order, he extinguished the\r\ntorch, after one last loving look at the pictured face upon the wall,\r\nand slipped out of the house like a shadow.\r\n\r\nThere was scarcely any one abroad. Doubtless the fear that a jaguar\r\nmight be lurking about kept the inhabitants indoors after dark. Even\r\nif Bomba should be met by any one, the probability was that in the\r\ndarkness he would pass as one of their own people.\r\n\r\nWith the keen observation that had been sharpened by his experience of\r\nthe jungle, he had carefully noted the location of Abino’s house and\r\nnow had no difficulty in finding it.\r\n\r\nA flickering light from the torches within shone through the open\r\nwindows. Avoiding the part that fronted on the straggling street,\r\nBomba glided round to the back of the house and crouched under one of\r\nthe openings that served as windows. That the conference was already\r\nin session was evident from the hum of conversation that came to the\r\nunseen listener.\r\n\r\nThe first word that Bomba could distinguish was the last that he had\r\nheard from the lips of Solani, “cooanaradi.” The coincidence sent a\r\nshiver through his veins. That word of evil omen, the word that stood\r\nfor the fiercest and deadliest snake in the Amazonian jungle! What\r\nsignificance did it have in a conversation that presumably concerned\r\nitself with Bomba?\r\n\r\nThe house was made of rough logs with many crevices. Applying his eyes\r\nto one of these, Bomba could see what was going on in the room without\r\nthe risk of discovery that would be involved in lifting his head above\r\nthe window sill.\r\n\r\nIn the room were gathered the same elders with whom he had talked in\r\nthe afternoon. To their number had been added the warriors, Sunka and\r\nBoshot, who had slain the jaguar in the morning.\r\n\r\nAn expression of deep perplexity was visible on all the dark faces. It\r\nwas plain that the problem with which they had to deal was giving them\r\na great deal of concern.\r\n\r\nBomba listened intently, trying not to lose a syllable. Abino was\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\n“It is certain that Japazy will not wish to see the stranger,” he said.\r\n“Who would wish to see the son of the man he had killed?”\r\n\r\n“Is it known to Abino that Japazy killed the stranger’s father?” asked\r\nBoshot.\r\n\r\n“Japazy has not told it to Abino,” was the answer. “But when Japazy has\r\ntaken too much intoxicating drink he has talked sometimes to himself\r\nand Abino’s ears have been open to his words. The stranger thinks his\r\nfather’s name was Bartow. When Japazy’s speech has been thick he has\r\nspoken the name of Bartow and made motions with his knife. Then he has\r\nsaid, ‘Bartow is dead.’ Then Japazy has smiled as if he were glad.”\r\n\r\n“Did Japazy kill the stranger’s mother, too?” asked Sunka.\r\n\r\n“Abino does not know,” the native replied. “Japazy has not spoken of\r\nthat. But many times he has gone to look at the woman’s face on the\r\nwall, and when he turned away Japazy’s face was net good to see.”\r\n\r\n“It may be that Japazy has questions he would ask of the stranger,\r\nas well as hear the stranger’s questions,” put in one of the elders.\r\n“Japazy may be angry if he comes back and finds the stranger dead so\r\nthat he may not speak with him.”\r\n\r\n“He need not know that the stranger has been here,” observed another of\r\nthe group. “We can put the people under silence so that they will not\r\nspeak of his coming.”\r\n\r\n“That would be better than to have the stranger kill Japazy,” remarked\r\nthe eldest of the company. “The stranger speaks smooth words, but who\r\nknows what black thoughts are in his heart? And if he wounds but does\r\nnot kill Japazy, what will Japazy do to us because we did not kill the\r\nstranger when he came among us?”\r\n\r\nThat this consideration had weight was evident from the grave\r\nexpression of his hearers.\r\n\r\nAt this moment there was a terrific roar from the volcano and the earth\r\nshook so violently under Bomba’s feet that he was thrown headlong. For\r\nseveral minutes the quake continued and then gradually subsided.\r\n\r\nWhen Bomba peered again through the crevice he could note consternation\r\non all faces.\r\n\r\n“Tamura is angry,” declared Abino solemnly. “To-day he has been more\r\nangry than for many moons. Why is that? It is because to-day the\r\nstranger came. He does not like the stranger. He wants that he should\r\ndie. Tamura has spoken.”\r\n\r\nA chill went through Bomba’s veins. It had been very unlucky for him\r\nthat the convulsion should have come at the very moment that they were\r\ndebating his fate. Now, as he looked from face to face, he could read\r\nhis doom. To their minds the god of the mountain had spoken, and it\r\nonly remained for them to bow to the decree.\r\n\r\nThere were whispers now, as though what they were discussing was too\r\nhorrid to be spoken of aloud. Strain his ears as he might, Bomba could\r\ncatch but a single sentence:\r\n\r\n“He shall die by the creeping death!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE FIRE STICK SPEAKS\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the utterance of their ominous words the elderly natives rose to\r\ntheir feet, and it was evident that the meeting was about to break up.\r\n\r\nIt would never do to be caught lurking there, and Bomba was off like a\r\nflash. The darkness had swallowed him up before any of the group had\r\ncome through the door.\r\n\r\nGliding along as silently as a ghost, he reached the dwelling of\r\nJapazy. There was no sign of any one having been there in his absence.\r\nEverything was as he had left it, and a deathlike silence wrapped the\r\nhouse like a garment.\r\n\r\nReaching his room he threw himself on the bed to think. And if he ever\r\nneeded to think swiftly and think wisely, it was then.\r\n\r\nNow he knew why Solani had looked at him so sadly and lingeringly, as\r\none looks on the face of the dead. The native boy had already sensed\r\nthe turn that things were taking and felt that in fact, if not in\r\nwords, the stranger’s death had been already decreed.\r\n\r\nBut sometimes there is a long way between a decree and its execution,\r\nand Bomba, despite the awful peril in which he stood, was by no means\r\nready to concede that he was as good as dead. Again and again he had\r\nfaced death and escaped by a hair’s breadth. And the quick wit and\r\nindomitable daring that had saved him then were his now.\r\n\r\nHe rapidly reviewed the possibilities in the case. Two courses of\r\naction seemed open to him. He could attempt to escape, to leave this\r\nterrible island, cross the river and reach the mainland, where he would\r\nbe safe. Or he could stay and face the enemies who were determined upon\r\nhis death and try in some way to defeat their purpose.\r\n\r\nBut if he adopted the first course, that would be an end to his chance\r\nof finding speech with Japazy. It would be putting aside his last\r\nchance to get some knowledge of his parents, of answering the questions\r\nthat for months past had tormented him.\r\n\r\nThe second course, Bomba had to admit to himself, was so foolhardy as\r\nalmost to smack of insanity. What chance would he have to make head\r\nagainst the warriors of the tribe if it came to a battle? He could\r\ndoubtless kill some of them, but in the end they would overwhelm him by\r\nsheer force of numbers.\r\n\r\nBut was there not a third course that offered some chance of success?\r\nSuppose he did indeed leave the village of Japazy, but still remain on\r\nthe island?\r\n\r\nHe felt sure that Japazy had gone to the sunken city with the towers of\r\ngold. Doubtless that was his treasure house, to which he had managed\r\nin some way to find access and to which he went from time to time\r\nto gather more riches. Only in that way could the priceless objects\r\nalready in this house be accounted for.\r\n\r\nBut if he had gone there, he had gone by the river and would have to\r\nreturn in the same way. Bomba knew from the description of Hondura the\r\ngeneral direction of the sunken city. It lay to the north. Why might\r\nnot Bomba lurk about the river bank to the north and descry Japazy’s\r\ncoming? Then he could boldly make himself known and get the interview\r\nthat he had come so far to seek.\r\n\r\nWhile he was immersed in these thoughts he became conscious of a slight\r\nrustling. It was so slight that none but a trained ear like that of\r\nBomba’s would have detected it at all.\r\n\r\nBut he heard it and was about to leap from the bed to investigate, when\r\nhe suddenly stiffened and lay as though carved from stone. For in a\r\nbeam of moonlight that filtered through the window he had caught sight\r\nof what looked like a long black rope dragging itself over the sill of\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nBut the long black rope was alive!\r\n\r\nBomba knew what it was, knew even before he saw the glint of the evil\r\neyes in the wicked head. It was a cooanaradi, the most deadly and\r\nterrible snake of the South American jungle, a species that sometimes\r\ngrows to twelve feet in length, is noted for its ferocity and speed and\r\nits eagerness to attack man even when retreat is possible. And its bite\r\nmeans certain death.\r\n\r\nA cold sweat broke over Bomba. He did not dare move a muscle.\r\n\r\nA cooanaradi! Now Bomba knew what Solani had meant. Now he fathomed the\r\nmeaning of that ominous phrase he had heard at the conference of the\r\nelders:\r\n\r\n“He shall die by the creeping death!”\r\n\r\nThe captive reptile had been brought to the house and silently\r\nreleased. The Indians knew that it would find its way to Bomba’s room\r\nby the smell of the food that had twice been served in it. Once in the\r\nroom with Bomba, the cooanaradi could be trusted to do the rest.\r\n\r\nThe infernal cunning of the scheme came to Bomba like a flash. If\r\nJapazy on his return should be vexed at not having spoken with Bomba,\r\nthe natives could point out that they were not responsible--that the\r\nsnake in some way had found its way into the house and killed the lad.\r\nThat would clear them from blame.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, Japazy should be relieved at finding the boy\r\ndead, the perpetrators could proudly boast their part in the deed and\r\ncount on the gratitude and perhaps the gifts of the master.\r\n\r\nThere was a horrid, slithering sound as the scaly body was dragged over\r\nthe floor. The deathlike stillness in which Bomba lay had thus far\r\nprevented his detection. Luckily the bed lay in the shadow.\r\n\r\nThe moonlight came into the room at an angle, and it was intercepted\r\nby the branches of a tree outside so that its beams were cast only at\r\nintervals here and there. It was only when the rays caught the long,\r\nblack body that Bomba was able to follow the course of the reptile\r\nabout the room. At other times he had to guess its location by the\r\nhorrid rustling that accompanied its progress.\r\n\r\nThere was a possible chance, Bomba thought, that the snake, not finding\r\nthe food it sought, would curl up after a while and go to sleep. But\r\nthis hope was dissipated as he caught a glimpse of the evil eyes\r\nthat were darting in every direction. Nothing was further from that\r\nmessenger of evil than sleep.\r\n\r\nIt was only a matter of time when the reptile would reach the bed. Then\r\nthe head would be upreared. It was beyond possibility that it would\r\nnot detect the lad lying there, no matter how still he kept.\r\n\r\nThen would come a dart like lightning and the terrible fangs, dripping\r\nwith poison, would be imbedded in the boy’s face or throat, and a very\r\nfew minutes later Bomba would be dead.\r\n\r\nHis weapons? The bow and arrow were out of the question. Long before\r\nhe could string his arrow the snake would be upon him. The knife? That\r\nmight serve at close quarters, but that meant he would be bitten first.\r\n\r\nThe fire stick!\r\n\r\nSlowly, imperceptibly, Bomba’s right hand stole to his pouch. It\r\ngripped the butt of the revolver. Quite as slowly his hand came back\r\nholding the weapon.\r\n\r\nThe slithering grew more distinct. The monster was drawing nearer.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment’s pause. Then a long rope seemed to rise from the\r\nfloor and Bomba found himself looking into the eyes of the cooanaradi.\r\n\r\nThe fire stick spoke!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTHE VOLCANO’S ROAR\r\n\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with the crack of the revolver Bomba threw himself from\r\nthe further side of the bed to the floor.\r\n\r\nThere was a terrible thrashing about of the reptile’s body, and Bomba\r\nknew that it had been hit. But whether it was mortally or only slightly\r\nwounded he could not tell.\r\n\r\nHe held the revolver in readiness for a second shot, fearing every\r\nmoment to see that dreadful head reappear.\r\n\r\nBut no second shot was necessary. A few more moments and the convulsive\r\nmovements ceased.\r\n\r\nThe cooanaradi was dead!\r\n\r\nWith infinite caution Bomba tiptoed to the other side of the bed. Now\r\nthere was no doubt. The reptile’s head was practically gone, shattered\r\ninto fragments by that first shot.\r\n\r\nBomba slumped down on the bed, hardly able to believe in his good\r\nfortune. He caressed the revolver lovingly and slipped in another\r\ncartridge to take the place of the one that had done such good service.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely had time to collect his scattered thoughts before there\r\nwas a noise outside as of people running. He looked out of the window\r\nand saw a number of shadowy forms, thrown into relief by the torches\r\nthat they carried.\r\n\r\nSome of the foremost halted under the window and Bomba could recognize\r\nAbino, Sunka, and Boshot, besides a couple of the elders who had been\r\nat the conference.\r\n\r\nThey had reached there so quickly following the shot that Bomba felt\r\nsure that they had been lurking in the vicinity, waiting for the\r\ncooanaradi to get in its deadly work.\r\n\r\nBomba smiled grimly to himself as he noted that they stopped at the\r\nwindow. He well knew why. Not one of them cared to come into a house in\r\nwhich they believed a cooanaradi was wandering around.\r\n\r\nThen, like a flash, the thought came to him that he might turn what\r\nthreatened to be a calamity into a blessing. Why should not the dead\r\nserpent prove a protector, a guardian of the dwelling? As long as they\r\nbelieved it was at large not one would risk stepping foot inside the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nWith this belief on the part of the Indians to aid him, Bomba might be\r\nable to hold the place until Japazy returned. At any rate, he would be\r\nable to choose his own time for leaving.\r\n\r\nThere was a whispered consultation beneath the window and then Abino\r\ncalled:\r\n\r\n“Is the stranger still awake?”\r\n\r\nBomba waited for a moment and then leaned out of the window.\r\n\r\n“He is awake. Does Abino want to speak words with him? Bomba’s ears are\r\nopen.”\r\n\r\n“Abino and the elders heard a great noise, and they feared that harm\r\nhad come to the stranger,” the native returned. “They have come to help\r\nhim, if he is in trouble.”\r\n\r\nTo help him! The men who had sent the serpent to strike him down!\r\n\r\nBomba’s blood boiled. But he restrained himself with an effort, and his\r\ntone was silken as he replied:\r\n\r\n“It is good of Abino and the elders to want to help Bomba. But he is\r\nnot in trouble. But why do Abino and the elders stand beneath the\r\nwindow? Will they not come in and talk with Bomba?”\r\n\r\nIn the moonlight he could see the movement of horrified recoil at the\r\nsuggestion, and again he smiled grimly to himself.\r\n\r\n“The stranger needs sleep,” replied Abino, after a momentary pause. “It\r\nis not well for us to talk with him when his eyes are heavy.”\r\n\r\n“Bomba is not tired, and he would be glad to speak words with Abino and\r\nthe elders,” returned the lad. “He is lonely. There is none here for\r\nhim to talk to except the cooanaradi.”\r\n\r\nThere was a gasp of amazement.\r\n\r\n“The cooanaradi!” came in a chorus from startled throats.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Bomba, with an ostentatious yawn. “The cooanaradi came\r\nin to talk with Bomba. Bomba talked to him. Bomba knows how to talk\r\nwith the cooanaradi. He will not hurt Bomba. Bomba has his hand on him\r\nnow,” and he reached down and touched the grisly coils. “He will not\r\nhurt any one who does not mean harm to Bomba.”\r\n\r\nA yell of fright came from the superstitious natives. What magic was\r\nthis of which the stranger was master, this mysterious lad who spoke of\r\nthe dreaded scourge of the jungle as though it were a cooing dove, who\r\ncould place his hand upon it and still remain alive?\r\n\r\nThey turned to retreat in a flight of panic when Bomba’s voice stayed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Abino will send food to Bomba in the morning?” he inquired.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment’s pause, and then Abino replied in a trembling voice:\r\n\r\n“Abino would not dare have Solani come into the house where a\r\ncooanaradi is.”\r\n\r\nBomba seemed to consider this.\r\n\r\n“It is well,” he replied. “Solani does not know how to talk to the\r\ncooanaradi as Bomba does. But he can bring food beneath the window in a\r\nbasket and Bomba will draw it up.”\r\n\r\n“Solani shall come,” promised Abino.\r\n\r\nTheir figures melted away in the distance and Bomba chuckled as he\r\nturned away. His reputation as a wizard was made. They were as afraid\r\nof him as they were of death. Now he could rest in tranquillity of soul\r\nuntil Japazy returned. For the first time in his life a cooanaradi had\r\nproved a friend--an involuntary friend, to be sure, but none the less a\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nBomba threw himself on the bed and in a few minutes was fast asleep.\r\n\r\nFor hours he slept.\r\n\r\nThen came a tremendous roar, a fearful explosion that sounded like the\r\ncrack of doom!\r\n\r\nBomba sprang from his bed and rushed to the window.\r\n\r\nThe heavens were a glare of red, and the glare was fiercest over in the\r\ndirection where Tamura lay.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND SINKS\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the crater of the volcano a great mass of flame and smoke belched\r\ntoward the sky. At the peak rivers were forming, rivers of molten\r\nlava, which, even as Bomba looked, began to flow down the sides of the\r\nmountain in every direction.\r\n\r\nThe fearful explosions still continued, and with every one, that\r\ndreadful column of flame mounted higher and the rivers of redhot\r\nlava increased in volume. The earth was rocking in the throes of an\r\nearthquake.\r\n\r\nWhile Bomba was still trying to gather his wits together and determine\r\nwhat he should do, the house of Japazy split apart. Half of it went\r\ndown in a deafening crash, and the other half, in which Bomba’s room\r\nwas located, swayed crazily, threatening at every instant to fall to\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nBomba slung his bow over his shoulder and rushed to the picture hanging\r\non the wall. He took it down--even in that moment of frenzied haste\r\nhe handled it reverently--and slipped the cord by which it had been\r\nsuspended about his neck, covering the picture under the puma skin that\r\nstretched across his breast.\r\n\r\nIf he were doomed to die in this terrible cataclysm, he would die with\r\nthat picture next his heart!\r\n\r\nHe glanced down the corridor and saw that it was blocked with debris.\r\nHis only exit was the window. Luckily, it was not more than twelve feet\r\nfrom the ground, and Bomba dropped down safely.\r\n\r\nHe was not a moment too soon, for he had barely got out of reach\r\nbefore the rest of the building fell. The dwelling of Japazy, that had\r\nwitnessed nobody knew how many grim tragedies, was now in ruins.\r\n\r\nIn the dim dawn that was coming up in the eastern sky, Bomba could see\r\nthat most of the other houses in the town had shared the same fate.\r\nPeople were rushing about in fright, men, women and children, fleeing\r\nthey knew not where, their only thought to get away from the fiery\r\nrivers of lava that were now pouring down rapidly toward the doomed\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nThe earth was opening in great rents, which sometimes widened and at\r\nother times snapped shut, engulfing houses, trees and sometimes hapless\r\nhuman beings, whose screams of terror were dreadful to hear.\r\n\r\nApart from these more spectacular demonstrations of the unchained\r\nforces of nature, there was a sense of gradual sinking that was\r\nsickening and ominous in the extreme.\r\n\r\nNo one paid any attention to Bomba, so engrossed was every one in\r\ntrying to find a path to safety.\r\n\r\nThe lad sniffed the air as a pointer does to get his sense of\r\ndirection. Then, when he knew that he was headed for the north end of\r\nthe island, he plunged into the woods and went as straight as an arrow\r\nto his goal.\r\n\r\nThere was terrible need for haste, as the rivers of lava were now\r\npouring into the woods, blasting into ashes whatever they touched. If\r\none of those rivers intercepted his path, it would be impossible to\r\ncross it.\r\n\r\nThe air was like that from a furnace, and Bomba was drenched with\r\nsweat as he made his way through the jungle. Showers of hot ashes were\r\nfalling all about him. Great forest trees lay athwart his path, hurled\r\nto the ground as though they had been saplings.\r\n\r\nOver and over came those deafening roars that seemed to split his\r\neardrums, and ever the rivers of lava swelled in volume. The hot blasts\r\nthat came from them scorched his throat and lungs and seared his eyes.\r\nHe felt as though he were moving in a nightmare.\r\n\r\nNow he was not alone. On every side the jungle was full of fleeing\r\nanimals and reptiles. There were hundreds of them, the jaguars which\r\nhad given the island its name, boa constrictors, dragging their huge\r\nlengths through the brush, jararacas, cooanaradis.\r\n\r\nThey brushed against Bomba, bumped into him, but not one of them gave\r\nhim the slightest attention. Every hostile and venomous instinct was\r\nswallowed up in panic, in the terror to escape. They did not know where\r\nthey were going. They did not care. All they thought of was to get away\r\nfrom that roaring mountain, from those terrible rivers of fire that\r\nthreatened to overwhelm them.\r\n\r\nUnexpectedly Bomba found himself on the edge of the river, the same\r\nsurging, turbulent stream that had brought him to Jaguar Island. He was\r\nsurprised at this, as he had calculated that he had at least a mile\r\nfurther to go before he reached its banks.\r\n\r\nAnd then he knew!\r\n\r\nThe river was creeping inland. It had already covered the ground to the\r\nwidth of a mile. The island was sinking!\r\n\r\nWith frantic haste Bomba gathered together three logs, tore some\r\ncreepers from the trees and lashed the logs together. Even in the brief\r\ntime it took him to do this the water had deepened until it was up to\r\nhis neck.\r\n\r\nHe pulled himself up on the rude and fragile raft and committed himself\r\nto the river. Soon the logs were in the grip of the current where they\r\ntossed about so violently that Bomba could not keep his feet. He threw\r\nhimself flat and with his hands through interstices of the logs held on\r\nfor his life.\r\n\r\nHe had little fear this time of the caymans. They themselves would be\r\ncowering with terror at this phenomenon that was shaking the bed of\r\nthe stream as well as the dry land above its level. They would make\r\nno hostile move. Even the jaguars, whose heads now dotted the stream\r\neverywhere, could swim to the mainland without any danger from an\r\nattack by the alligators.\r\n\r\nThe current carried the raft toward the further side of the river, and\r\nbefore long it struck heavily against a jutting point of land. With one\r\nspring Bomba landed on the point, and a moment later stood safe on the\r\nfringe of the jungle.\r\n\r\nAs he looked toward the island there came a stupendous crash that\r\ndwarfed everything that had preceded. Once more Tamura belched forth\r\na great torrent of flame. Then the whole island sank out of sight and\r\nwhere it had been were only miles of widely tossing waters.\r\n\r\nBomba viewed the terrible spectacle with awe and consternation. The\r\nisland where he had hoped to learn so much no longer existed.\r\n\r\nBut he was safe! His life had been spared--and that counted for much.\r\n\r\nThen another comforting thought came to him. The island of Japazy had\r\nsunk. But, as far as he knew, Japazy himself still lived. He would find\r\nthe half-breed yet.\r\n\r\nWhat fruit was borne by that determination will be seen in the next\r\nvolumes of this series: “Bomba the Jungle Boy in the Abandoned City;\r\nor, A Treasure Ten Thousand Years Old.”\r\n\r\n“Japazy still lives,” murmured Bomba to himself. “Bomba will seek him\r\nout.”\r\n\r\nHe took reverently from beneath the puma skin the portrait of the\r\nlovely woman. Again those beautiful eyes looked into his.\r\n\r\n“Mother,” he whispered. “Mother!”\r\n\r\nHis eyes blurred. He pressed his lips to the picture and replaced it\r\nnext his heart.\r\n\r\nThen he struck into the jungle.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BOMBA BOOKS\r\n\r\nBy ROY ROCKWOOD\r\n\r\n_12mo.
