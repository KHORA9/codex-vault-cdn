III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _A Journal of a Voyage from _England_ to _Constantinople_, made in\r\n    the Year, 1668. by _T. Smith_, D. D. and F. R. S._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn _Monday_ Evening _August 3, 1668._ we took Barge at _Tower-Wharf_,\r\nand at _Greenwich_ went on Board the _Bezant_ Yacht for the _Downs_,\r\nwhere we arrived the next day in the Afternoon, and went on Board\r\nthe _Leopard_ Frigat, a Ship of 56 Guns mounted, Captain _O Bryen_\r\nCommander, appointed to carry Sir _Daniel Harvey_, his Majesty's\r\nAmbassador to the Port of the _Ottoman_ Emperor at _Constantinople_.\r\nHere, upon his first Arrival, the Ambassador was Complemented by Sir\r\n_Jeremy Smith_, then riding Admiral, Sir _Edward Spragg_, and several\r\nother Commanders of the Men of War, and afterwards Saluted with\r\nFifteen Pieces of Ordinance by the Admiral, to whom we returned as\r\nmany; then by the Vice-Admiral, and several other Ships. All which were\r\nanswered together at the same time with 21 in the whole.\r\n\r\nHere we were forced to Ride for several days, the Winds being contrary.\r\n\r\nIn the _Offing_ between the _North Foreland_ and _South Foreland_ it\r\nruns Tide and half Tide, that is, it is either ebbing Water or Flood\r\nupon the Shore, in that part of the _Downs_, three hours, which is\r\ngrossly speaking the time of half a Tide, before it is so, off at\r\nSea. (For the flux and reflux of the Sea is not made exactly twice in\r\n24 hours, but, as it appears by accurate observation, it requires an\r\noverplus of almost 50 minutes.) The reason of this diversity of Tides,\r\nI take to be from the meeting of the two Seas in that narrow Streight.\r\n\r\nOftentimes when the Wind has blown hard at N. E. or at W. or W. and\r\nby S. there has hapn'd an alteration of the Tides in the River of\r\n_Thames_, which ignorant People have mistakenly lookt upon as a Prodigy.\r\n\r\nIt is a most certain Observation, that where it flows Tide and half\r\nTide, tho' the Tide of Flood runs aloft, yet the Tide of Ebb runs under\r\nfoot, that is, close by the _ground_; and so at the Tide of Ebb, it\r\nwill flow under foot, as that great and experienc'd Sea-Commander, Sir\r\n_H. Manwaring_, words it.\r\n\r\n_August 9._ We sailed from the _Downs_, but were soon forced back\r\nby distress of Weather, and came to an Anchor S. W. of the _South\r\nForeland_.\r\n\r\n10. The Wind blew at S. S. W. and the Sea run very high, so that we\r\nwere in danger of losing our Cable and Anchor; the Ground, where we\r\nrode, at 16 Fathom ½ water, being somewhat gruff.\r\n\r\n15. The Wind coming about at W. N. W. we sailed, and were Saluted with\r\nnine Guns from _Dover_ Castle, and seven from one Fort, and five from\r\nanother. We carried a Flag upon our Maintop, after we came out of the\r\n_Downs_. The Wind in the Afternoon at N. E. brought us by seven of the\r\nClock to the _Ness_, where we lay at Anchor during the Tide of Flood;\r\nduring which time the Mariners caught good store of _Whitings_, baiting\r\ntheir Hooks with raw Mutton.\r\n\r\n16. We were in the morning athwart St. _Helen_'s Point in the _Isle of\r\nWight_; where we discovered Sir _Thomas Allen_ with his Squadron under\r\nSail, bound for the _Straits_.\r\n\r\n17. In the morning we got to the West of _Portland_, the Wind at N. by\r\nE. our Course lying thereupon S. S. W. but about noon, sailing over\r\npart of the Race of _Portland_, where we met with a tumbling Sea, we\r\nAnchored at the N. W. part in the Bay, over against the Point that\r\nlooks towards _Weymouth_. We were ashore in the Island, which seems\r\nto be but one continued Rock; the Soil in several places not being\r\nabove five or six Inches deep, as I found by digging a hole with my\r\nKnife; yet the Corn flourishing enough. The Castle consists of a double\r\nFortification; we could not observe above five Guns mounted. They told\r\nus, that in the Island there was but 1 Church, and 4 Villages.\r\n\r\nWe weighed at twelve of the Clock at night: But\r\n\r\n18. The Wind blowing fiercely at W. directly in our teeth, we made but\r\nlittle way, and could not weather the _Start_ Point that night. The\r\nMoon upon its first emerging above the Horizon, seemed to have a colour\r\nlike burnt Brick, the Sky very cloudy: but some Rain falling, as she\r\nadvanced higher and higher, she appeared more and more fiery.\r\n\r\n19. We weathered the _Start_ Point by noon, but could not make much way\r\nbeyond it.\r\n\r\n20. We got into _Plymouth_ Sound. The Cittadel, built upon a Rock, with\r\nlarge Counterscarps and Bastions, returned our Salute with nine Guns.\r\nSir _Thomas Allen_ with his Fleet stood to the Lizard, and came not to\r\nan Anchor.\r\n\r\n21. Misty Weather. About eleven Clock Forenoon, and about six in the\r\nEvening, we observed the Vapours in great quantity ascend out of the\r\nSea, soon covering the tops of the Mountains. Here we staid three days,\r\ntaking in some Provisions, ready prepared for us.\r\n\r\nOn _Sunday_ the 23_d_ of _August_ we weighed out of _Plymouth_ Sound,\r\nand made the _Lizard_, a Promontory in _Cornwall_, before night: The\r\n_Manacles_, several Rocks so called, we discerned very distinctly, it\r\nbeing then low Ebb; as also the Lands end. The Wind blew fresh; and we\r\nobserved the Waves in the Night-time, as if they had been liquid Fire,\r\nbut palish.\r\n\r\nThe _Lizard_ bearing N. of us, we changed our Course, and taking leave\r\nof _England_, we sailed into the Ocean. God of his Mercy send us a\r\nhappy Voyage.\r\n\r\n24. We run this day thirty nine Leagues by a Compute from our Log-line.\r\n\r\n25. We were full open with the _Bay of Biscay_. Several _Gulls_ were\r\nhovering over the Surface of the Water to catch Fish, which swam by in\r\nvast sholes, at about 50 Leagues distance from any Land.\r\n\r\nAt other times I have seen several Birds floating upon the Water,\r\nwhich being driven by some Tempest from the Coasts of _Spain_ and\r\n_Portugal_, have been tired in their flight, and so drowned. This\r\nhappens frequently in the great Ocean, where they meet with no Land\r\nto fly to in several hundreds of Leagues; and sometimes even in the\r\n_Mediterranean_, in the Mid-Seas between the _Christian_ and _Barbary_\r\nShores. In blowing Weather, among other Birds flying cross, we saw a\r\nHawk making to our Ship, then under good and swift Sail, which perched\r\nupon the round-top of the Main-mast; which one of the Seamen espying,\r\nhe presently run up the Shrouds, and brought down the Hawk, which made\r\nno attempt to fly away, being quite spent. But not long after, the Hawk\r\nrecovering his Spirits by rest and meat which was given him, took wing\r\nand got away from the Fellow, notwithstanding all the care he took to\r\nsecure his new Adventure, which he hoped to have made Mony of at the\r\nnext Port that we should come to.\r\n\r\n26. A strong Levant still blowing, and the Sea very rough and\r\nboisterous, the Gale continuing almost right a stern, we run these 24\r\nhours above 70 Leagues.\r\n\r\n27. We found our selves by our observations, that we were in the\r\nLatitude of 42 degrees 17 minutes, and began to be very sensible of our\r\nnearer approach to the South, the Weather being excessive hot. In the\r\nAfternoon we heard the report of several Guns fired at about seven or\r\neight Leagues distance, as we guessed. At eight of the Clock at night\r\nanother Gun was fired somewhat near us, which we thought might be from\r\nan _Algerine_ Man of War, who gave a signal to his Consorts, and who\r\nanswered by several flashes of Powder. Whereupon our Trumpeters sounded\r\na Point of War, but no return was made. However, the Captain quartered\r\nhis Men, and the Decks were cleared, and all things made ready in order\r\nto a Fight the next Morning; as soon as day appeared, we saw the Sea\r\nclear, no Ships being in view any way: so that we concluded that they\r\nwere Merchant-Ships, with their Convoy, standing to the Northward.\r\n\r\n28. Dreadful Lightnings in the Clouds towards the Evening; after which\r\ngreat Dews fell: the Weather extream hot.\r\n\r\n29. We saw a Pilot-fish swim by the sides of the Ship, and several\r\nBonito's and Albicores playing, as it were with their Heads above\r\nWater. The Wind took us short in the night, and soon after there was\r\na stark Calm; and we had great reason to bless God for it: For had\r\nwe continued our Course that night, we had either run a-ground, or\r\nhad been cast upon the Rocks near to _Peniche_ in _Portugal_. The\r\nfault was mis-reckoning, and haling in too soon to make the _Southern\r\nCape_: though the Seamen, to salve their Credit, and to excuse their\r\nError, which had like to have proved so fatal to us, pretended that we\r\nwere set in by a strong Current. God make us thankful for this great\r\nDeliverance.\r\n\r\n30. This Morning we were surprized to see our selves within four or\r\nfive Leagues of the Shore, when we had thought that we had been above\r\ntwenty. In the Afternoon, the Wind coming on fresh, we weathered the\r\nwestermost Isle of the _Barlings_. On the greatest of which, being as\r\nwe guessed, above half a Mile in length, the _Portuguese_ have built a\r\nFort to hinder the _Barbary_ Pirates from careening their Ships there,\r\nor taking in fresh Water. The Land of it very high, and bore off us S.\r\nE. by E. By it lie several Rocks. The other Islands are distant about a\r\nLeague. I told five of them: the greatest of which last lie somewhere\r\ninward to the Shore.\r\n\r\nFor two Nights together about this time (28 and 29) the Sky being\r\nvery hazy, the Sun set in a colour as deep as Blood, which was very\r\nastonishing. We were then in the Latitude of 40.\r\n\r\n31. Betimes in the Morning we sailed by the Rock of _Lisbon_, at some\r\ndistance, which was scarce discernible by reason of the cloudiness of\r\nthe Weather. Two _Turks_ Men of War are now plying to the Windward of\r\nus; but dare not come up to speak with us, perceiving that we are only\r\nladen with Powder and Bullet.\r\n\r\n_September 1._ In the Morning we made Cape _St. Vincent_. I went on\r\nShore with the Lieutenant and several others in our Pinnace, which we\r\ndrove into one of the Coves; and were forced to climb up a Rock, the\r\nascent of which was very dangerous and troublesome; and made more so by\r\nthe Rays of the Sun, which were reflected with that vehemence, that the\r\nHeat was almost intolerable. Having gained the top, we were met by an\r\nOfficer and some Soldiers, who had us into the Castle, the middlemost\r\nof the three, which are built along that Promontory for the Security\r\nof the Coasts, and entertained us with Wine, Grapes, and Marmalade.\r\nThey told us, that a Squadron of English Men of War sailed by the day\r\nbefore. We here met with two Vessels belonging to _Dartmouth_, laden\r\nwith Fish from _Newfoundland_, bound for _Alicant_. All along the\r\nCoasts, at the distance of about two or three Leagues, are several\r\nWatch-towers built to give notice of Pirates.\r\n\r\nBecalmed for the most part these two or three days.\r\n\r\n5. In the Morning we weathered the Point of _Cadiz_, and came to an\r\nAnchor in the _Bay of Bulls_, about half a League from the great\r\n_Porgoe_; and in the Afternoon went on shore. We were entertained by\r\nthe _English_ Consul, and carried by him to view the Fortifications,\r\nwhich are esteemed to be as regular as any in _Christendom_; built\r\nin the same place where the Town had been attacked formerly by the\r\n_English_, under the Conduct of the Earl of _Essex_ in the Reign of\r\nQ. _Elizabeth_. Plays are usually here, as in other parts of _Spain_,\r\nacted on a _Sunday_. During the time of our stay, was represented the\r\nHistory of the Patience of _Job_, the Devil brought upon the Stage,\r\ntempting _Job_'s Wife in a drolling way, which caused great Laughter\r\nand Merriment among the Spectators. At _Malaga_, as the Merchants told\r\nus, the _Sunday_ before we arrived there, was acted the _Schism of\r\nEngland_ in the time of King _Henry_ the Eighth, whom the _Spaniards_\r\nwill not yet forgive, for Divorcing himself from Q. _Catherine_, their\r\nCountry-Woman.\r\n\r\n9. We sailed from _Cadiz_.\r\n\r\n10. This Afternoon we were forced to Anchor, not far from _Cape\r\nSpartel_ or _Sprat_, as the Seamen call it, not being able to weather\r\nthe Point.\r\n\r\n11. This day we came to an Anchor in _Tangier-Bay_, with Sir _Thomas\r\nAllen_'s Squadron.\r\n\r\n_Tangier_ lies within the Entrance into the _Strait_ of the\r\n_Mediterranean_, in the Latitude of about 35°, 36´. It is situated in\r\nthe bottom of a Bay, and is built on the side of the Hill, overlooking\r\nthe Sea, encompassed with high Walls to the Land-ward, and commanded\r\nby a strong Castle. The Heats would be very troublesome but for the\r\nSea-breezes which cool and fan the Air. In the Castle I met with a\r\n_Roman_ Monument, erected to the Honour of _P. Belius_, a great Officer\r\nand Souldier in _Trajan_'s time; who, among his other Titles, is\r\nthere stiled, PPO. FIG. MAURITANIAE. TINGITANAE: which since has been\r\ntaken away, and presented to the University of _Oxon_ by Sir _Hugh\r\nCholmondley_, and now serves to adorn the _Area_ about the _Theatre_.\r\n\r\nThe _English_ have two Churches here, (though they only make use of\r\none, the other being reserved against all Accidents) both of them\r\nvery neat and convenient; though not to be compared with the Church\r\nof the _Portuguese_, retained still, according to the Articles of\r\nAgreement, when the King of _Portugal_ made over the Right and Title,\r\nand gave the Possession of _Tangier_ to the Crown of _England_, by\r\nthe Canons Regulars, belonging to it, which is very stately, and\r\nadorn'd with rich Images, and supported by Marble Pillars. Toward one\r\nend of the _English_ Church, just by the Vestiary, which had been\r\nformerly a _Turkish_ Mosch, and afterward the Chappel of a Convent of\r\n_Dominicans_, is a Monumental Stone-Table in _Arabick_ Characters,\r\ncontaining an account of the Houses, Lands, and other Revenues\r\nbelonging to it, set up in the 743 year of the _Hegira_, that is,\r\nof Christ 1341. The Mole is in good forwardness, they having gained\r\nabove 200 yards in the Sea, in order to the making of a good and safe\r\nHarbour for Ships to ride in, which lye open to Wind and Waves; the\r\noutward side to the Seaward somewhat sloping. The Garrison is in so\r\ngood a posture of Defence, that they defy _Taffiletta_ and all his\r\nForces. Here we met with great Civilities from Colonel _Norwood_,\r\nDeputy-Governour, and the Gentlemen belonging to the Garrison. Sir\r\n_Harry Mildmay_ and Mr. _Goodland_, two of King _Charles_ the First his\r\nJudges, are here; but who have the Liberty of the Town. Now, at our\r\nbeing here, come in several _Moors_ from _Arzilla_, and among the rest,\r\nthe Father of one of _Gayland_'s Wives, to get a Passage for _Algiers_.\r\n\r\nOld _Tangier_ lyes at some little distance, where they find very\r\nfrequently in digging several pieces of _Roman_ Coin. But for the\r\nabove-mentioned, and the other Curiosities and Antiquities of\r\n_Tangier_, of which I forbear to make mention, from the imperfect and\r\nhasty Observations of two days, the greatest part of which being taken\r\nup by the Entertainment of our obliging Country-men, you may consult\r\nwith great pleasure and satisfaction, a little Book called _The present\r\nState of Tangier_, written by a very ingenious Gentleman, and printed\r\nin the Year 1676.\r\n\r\nThere is a vast _draught_ of _water_ poured continually out of the\r\n_Atlantick_ into the _Mediterranean_, the mouth or entrance of which\r\nbetween _Cape Spartel_ or _Sprat_, as the _sea-men_ call it, and _Cape\r\nTrafalgar_, may be near 7 leagues wide, the _current_ setting strong\r\ninto it, and not losing its force till it runs as far as _Malaga_,\r\nwhich is about 20 leagues within the _Streights_. By the benefit of\r\nthis _Current_, tho' the wind be contrary, if it does not over-blow,\r\n_Ships_ easily turn into the _gut_, as they term the _narrow passage_,\r\nwhich is about 20 miles in length. At the end of which are two Towns,\r\n_Gibraltar_ on the coast of _Spain_, which gives denomination to\r\nthe _Streight_, and _Ceuta_ on the _Barbary_ coast: at which places\r\n_Hercules_ is supposed to have set up his _Pillars_. What becomes\r\nof this great quantity of water poured in this way, and of that,\r\nwhich runs from the _Euxine_ into the _Bosporous_ and _Propontis_,\r\nand is carried at last through the _Hellespont_ into the _Ægæan_ or\r\n_Archipelago_, is a curious _speculation_, and has exercised the wit\r\nand understanding of _Philosophers_ and _Navigators_. For there is no\r\nsensible rising of the _water_ all along the _Barbary Coast_, even down\r\nto _Alexandria_, the land beyond _Tripoli_, and that of _Ægypt_, lying\r\nvery low, and easily overflowable. They observe indeed, that the water\r\nrises 3 feet, or 3 feet and an half, in the _gulph_ of _Venice_, and as\r\nmuch, or very near as much, all along the _Riviera_ of _Genoa_, as far\r\nas the river _Arno_: but this rather adds to the wonder.\r\n\r\nI here omit to speak at large of the several _Hypotheses_ which\r\nhave been invented to solve this difficulty: such as _subterraneous\r\nvents_, cavities and indraughts, _exhalations_ by the _Sun-beams_, the\r\nrunning out of the water on the _African side_, as if there were a\r\nkind of circular motion of the water, and that it only flowed in upon\r\nthe _Christian_ shore: which latter I look upon as a meer fancy, and\r\ncontrary to all observation.\r\n\r\nMy conjecture is, that there is an _under-Current_, whereby as great\r\na quantity of water is carried out, as comes flowing in. To confirm\r\nwhich, besides what I have said above about the difference of tides\r\nin the _offing_, and at the _Shore_ in the _Downs_, which necessarily\r\nsupposes an _under-Current_, I shall present you with an instance of\r\nthe like nature in the _Baltick Sound_, as I received it from an able\r\nSeaman, who was at the making of the tryal.\r\n\r\nHe told me, that being there in one of the _King's_ Frigats, they\r\nwent with their _Pinnace_ into the _middle stream_, and were carried\r\nviolently by the _Current_: that soon after they sank a _bucket_ with\r\na large _Cannon_ bullet to a certain _depth_ of water, which gave\r\ncheck to the boats motion, and sinking it still lower and lower, the\r\n_boat_ was driven a-head to wind-ward against the upper _Current_: the\r\n_current_ aloft, as he added, not being above 4 or 5 _fathom_ deep, and\r\nthat the lower the bucket was let fall, they found the _under-Current_\r\nthe stronger. I designed to have made the _Experiment_ in the\r\n_Streights-Channel_; but both times I past, the Easterly wind blew\r\nso hard, that there was no putting out the boat with any safety; nor\r\nindeed at those times had we any leisure for such a _Curiosity_; which\r\nthose, who liv'd at _Tangier_, might have tryed without any difficulty\r\nor danger.\r\n\r\nThis conjecture, how likely or unlikely soever, will stand or fall\r\naccording to the certainty of the _Observations_, which shall be made\r\nthere, which I will endeavour to procure in order to the further\r\nestablishment, or utter overthrow of it.\r\n\r\n13. We weighed out of _Tangier_ and turned into the _Strait_, though\r\nagainst the Wind. The distance between _Gibraltar_ Cape, which gives\r\nname to the _Straits_, and is joyned to the Continent of _Spain_ and\r\n_Ceuta_ a well-built and strongly fortified Town, lying under the Hill\r\n_Alybe_, called so by the _Greeks_, which the Seamen commonly call,\r\nas do some _Spanish_ Writers, _Apes-hill_, from the great number of\r\nApes which used formerly to haunt there, (at which places _Hercules_ is\r\nfeigned to have set up his Pillars) may be about six Leagues; tho' both\r\nLands lying very high (for we saw the Clouds much below them) it does\r\nnot appear in the middle of the Current, out of a tall Ship, scarce\r\nhalf so broad.\r\n\r\n14. Little Wind stirring.\r\n\r\n15. A great Mist all the Sea over, so that we could scarce see three\r\nlengths of the Ship, which began to vanish in the Afternoon; and than\r\nwe descryed the _Cape of Malaga_ at about four Leagues distance; and\r\ncame to an Anchor that Night. The City lies under a high Hill, and\r\nis the Seat of a Bishop, who is at this time a Natural Son of King\r\n_Philip_ the Fourth, of the Order of St. _Dominic_. Here the Merchants\r\ntold us, that it had not rained for seven Months together, except a day\r\nor two for an Hour: and that the _Algerines_, who were then breaking\r\nwith us, had not been able to have set a Fleet to Sea about two years\r\nbefore, if they had not been furnished with Masts from _England_; and\r\nthat they were now in Expectation of another Ship laden with the same,\r\nnotwithstanding the Rupture, which was as good as began. I only make a\r\nQuery, Whether _Jews_ or _English_ Men were the Freighters?\r\n\r\n16. The next Morning the Governour immediately returned our Salute Gun\r\nfor Gun: soon after we weighed from _Malaga_ Road, the Weather very\r\nhot. Some Rain fell at Night, though very moderately. In the Evening,\r\nafter we had sailed about eighteen Leagues, we were becalm'd. The Sea\r\nbeing quiet, we saw a great number of _Tortoises_ swimming above Water,\r\nseveral _Bottle-noses_, fish of about three yards long, and very thick,\r\nand Hawks flying over to the _Barbary_ Coast. The Hills of _Granada_\r\nwere seen plainly by us, though at a great distance.\r\n\r\nThe Wind coming Easterly, we kept at Sea, beating and plying to and\r\nagain for these four days, scarce gaining sixteen Leagues of our way,\r\nand were forc'd to come to an Anchor in the _Bay of Adera_, where there\r\nis a strong Cittadel, about thirty four or thirty five Leagues from\r\n_Malaga_.\r\n\r\n21. We passed by _Cape de Gata_: but the Levant wind still blowing,\r\nhaving continued almost in that Point for above two Months, as we\r\ncomputed from what they had told us at _Tangier_, we could make but\r\nlittle progress in our Voyage.\r\n\r\n25. Between three and four of the Clock in the Morning the Tornado's\r\nbegan to blow, and the Wind violent for the time, with such continued\r\nFlashes of Lightning for several hours, as that the whole Sky seemed\r\nto be on fire, intermixed with terrible Claps of Thunder, after which\r\nfollowed great showers of Rain.\r\n\r\n25. The Wind still contrary, we descryed _Cape St. Martin_ at about\r\nfifteen Leagues distance. Tacking about and standing off to Seaward,\r\nnext Morning 27. we found that we had lost about three Leagues of our\r\nway.\r\n\r\n28. We were athwart _Orlando's Gap_ within two Leagues of the Shore,\r\n_Cape St. Martin_ bearing off us _N._ by _W._ The Wind now still; but\r\na swelling Sea coming from the Westward, which is usual before a Wind,\r\nwhich drives the Water before it.\r\n\r\nOn _Michaelmas-day_ we were up with the Island _Ivica_, or _Ivise_, as\r\nthe Mariners call it, and the Wind blowing fair, we stood our Course;\r\nand the next day at Noon we made the _Island Majorca_, situate over\r\nagainst the Kingdom of _Valentia_, and came to an Anchor in the _Bay_\r\nof the City, being forced in hither for want of fresh Water. In the\r\nAfternoon the Boat was sent on shore; but the Vice-Roy would not give\r\nus Prattick, not bringing a Patent from _Malaga_.\r\n\r\n_Octob. 1._ The Secretary was sent with the King's Pass to the\r\nVice-Roy to demand Prattick, who presently summoned the Officers of\r\nthe _Sanita_. After long Debates and Delays they consented, and came\r\nto the _Mole_ to receive him. He went directly to the Governour to\r\nacquaint him, that we were ready to Salute the City with what number\r\nof Guns he pleased, if he would engage upon his Honour to give us as\r\nmany. He replied, that he would give us three for five; and wondered,\r\nthat we being but a single Ship, should make such a Demand. The\r\nSecretary told him, That we were to be treated as an Admiral, having\r\na Flag on our Maintop; and that the Governour of _Malaga_ had done\r\nit. To this he said, That _Majorca_ was a Kingdom, that he was the\r\nKing's Representative, and that by Reason of the Miscarriage of his\r\nPredecessor, when Monsieur _de Beaufort_, the _French_ Admiral was\r\nthere, he had received strict Orders from _Madrid_ not to do the\r\nlike. The Secretary replied, That we had an Ambassador on board, and\r\nhad as strict Orders, and should answer as severely for the Breach\r\nof them. His last Answer was, That we might, with our Sails loose,\r\nkeep before the Town, till we had furnished our selves with what we\r\nwanted. Upon receiving this Message, the Ambassador dispatched away one\r\n_Joseph Gabriel Cortez_, a _Spaniard_, but employed by the _English_\r\nMerchants trading to that Island, then on board our Ship, to acquaint\r\nhim, That when we were ready to go away, we would loose our Sails,\r\nand not before. We landed within the _Mole_; the Walk upon it about\r\nfour or five Yards broad; at the Extremity of which is a very large\r\nand stately Gate, which leads into the City. We went into the great\r\nChurch, somewhat wider than _Westminster-Abbey_, but darkish within:\r\nthe Portal very magnificent, adorned with several Marble Statues in\r\nNiches one over another. The High Altar very plain and unadorned: but\r\nothers extraordinary rich and glorious. Not far from the City are\r\nseveral Mills to grind their Olives, Oyl being the great Commodity of\r\nthe Island.\r\n\r\n2. The next Morning we weighed, without taking any kind of notice of\r\nthe Town, sailing all along in sight of the Island, which presented\r\nus with a pleasing and delightful Prospect; the Valleys, lying under\r\nthe Hills, fruitful of Wine and Corn. The whole Island is judged to be\r\nabout sixty Leagues in Compass, and in length about fifteen: which we\r\nsailed from the Westermost Point, where lies the Isle _Dragovera_, at\r\na very little distance to the Eastermost, where there is built a small\r\nFort. To the S. S. E. lie several little Islands, called the _Cabreas_;\r\nbetween which and _Majorca_ we steered.\r\n\r\n3. We were athwart _Port Maon_ in _Minorca_; a fine level Country,\r\nhaving but one Hill in it N. W. by W. as it bore off us. In the Evening\r\nthe Wind very scant.\r\n\r\n4. This day, as yesterday, excessive hot.\r\n\r\n5. In the Afternoon we descryed the Main Land of _Provence_.\r\n\r\n6. We were over against the Islands _Hieres_ and the Highland of\r\n_Thoulon_.\r\n\r\n7, 8. These two Days becalmed; and the Sea extraordinary smooth.\r\n\r\n9. We were over against the Westermost part of the _Alpes_, which we\r\ndistinctly saw at about twenty Leagues distance, and appeared far\r\nhigher than the Hills of _Granada_.\r\n\r\n10. We sailed by _Final_ and _Ventimiglia_.\r\n\r\n12. We came in the Morning to an Anchor over against the _Mole_, and\r\nnot far from the Lantern in _Genoa_. Having obtained Prattick of the\r\n_Maestri della Sanita_, after a little demur about the Salute, the\r\nSenate being assembled, and some of them protesting upon their Honours,\r\nand ready to produce their Registers, that they never saluted the Ship\r\nwherein was an Ambassador of _France_ or _Spain_, as not taking any\r\nnotice of the Person who did bear that Character, 'till they had first\r\nintimation, that the Ship was arrived in their Port by its saluting the\r\nTown. It was agreed that the Ship should Salute the Town with eleven\r\nGuns, which they were to answer, as they did, with an equal number:\r\nand after a little pause, they saluted the Ambassador with nineteen\r\nmore, which was answered with as many. After this, the Duke and\r\nSenate sent the Master of the Ceremonies to wait upon the Ambassador:\r\nwho going away, returned soon after with a Present of Calves, Fowl,\r\nWine, Sweetmeats, _&c._ and acquainted his Lordship, that they had\r\ndeputed six of their Gentlemen to Complement him, and wait upon him;\r\nwhich Civility he thought fit to refuse, desiring to be _Incognito_.\r\nBut however, going ashore, he was welcomed by the _Illustrissimi\r\nSigniori_, the _Durazzo's_, two Brothers, the elder of which had been\r\nAmbassador for the Republick, in the Court of _England_, and the other\r\nat _Constantinople_, and by them carried to see the _Villas_ out of\r\nTown. The figure of _Genoa_ is Semicircular, beginning from the Lantern\r\nWestward, lying under an high Hill, upon the rising of which the\r\nseveral Houses, built of Marble, afford a very fine Prospect, and add\r\nmuch to the Beauty and Glory of the place. _Strada nuova_ perchance\r\nis the most stately Street in the whole World. The new Church of the\r\n_Annunciata_, built by the _Lomellini_, where a thousand may go up the\r\nstairs abreast at the same time, for curious Painting, rich Altars,\r\nand exactness of Architecture, incomparable. The _Duome_ also and the\r\nChurch of the _Theatins_ very stately and curious. Other matters I\r\npurposely omit.\r\n\r\n14. In the Evening we set Sail from _Genoa_.\r\n\r\nBecalmed for the most part these three Days, though helped somewhat\r\nforward by the Breezes that blew off the shore after Sun set.\r\n\r\n18. In the Afternoon we made the Island _Gorgonia_, about nine Leagues\r\nfrom _Livorne_; a little round Island, with a Castle on the top.\r\n\r\n19. In the Morning we came to an Anchor in _Livorne_ Road, about a Mile\r\nfrom the Town: the Road large and secure, especially to the Northward.\r\nThe Ambassador keeps on Board, the Governour refusing to Salute the\r\nShip first, though he had formerly saluted the _French_; pretending\r\nthat every Convoy might carry a Flag; and alledging that his Master,\r\nthe Grand Duke, was as great and absolute, as the Republick of _Genoa_:\r\nand that they had rather throw themselves upon the King of _England_,\r\nthan do a thing which might prove of such an ill Consequence. Sir _John\r\nFinch_, his Majesty's Resident, together with Sir _Thomas Baines_,\r\ncame from _Florence_ to Complement the Ambassador, and immediately\r\ndispatched away a Courier to the Grand Duke about the Salute; who\r\nreferred the whole Affair to the Governor: and he making a Protest that\r\nhe was ready to pay all the respect which was due to the Ambassador's\r\nCharacter and Quality, upon the fore-mentioned Pretensions, six days,\r\nafter our arrival, absolutely refused to Salute the Ship first.\r\n\r\n_Livorne_ is the great Magazine of Trade for the _Levant_, being a free\r\nPort: Merchants of all Countries residing here, _Armenians_ especially,\r\nand _Jews_; which latter enjoy great Priviledges, without wearing any\r\ndistinct Mark in their Hats or Habits, whereby they may be known. They\r\nare allow'd the publick Exercise of their Religion: their Synagogue\r\nlarge and handsome. The Port inward has a _Mole_ for the Duke's Galleys\r\nand other small Vessels to ride in: the Entrance of which is chained\r\nup every Night. Hard by is the Statue of Duke _Ferdinand_ in Marble,\r\nraised upon an high Pedestal; under which are four Slaves in Brass,\r\nin different Postures, very large, and above the ordinary proportion,\r\nbut done with exquisite and admirable Art. Two Castles to the Seaward\r\nwell fortified: the Town Walls very high, and the four Gates strongly\r\nguarded: below which is a Ditch of about fifteen or twenty yards over,\r\nand very deep. No Stranger is allowed to view the Works, nor Souldier\r\npermitted to come out of the Castles. About four thousand Slaves are\r\nthere, as the Merchants told us, who are lockt up in the _Bagno_ every\r\nNight. The _Piazza_, where the Merchants meet, is adorned with Marble\r\nPillars, which sustain the Porticos: at the East end of which is the\r\ngreat Church whose Roof appears very glorious, having several Circles\r\nrichly gilded and painted with curious Figures.\r\n\r\nThe broad Street is paved between two and three yards on each side with\r\nFree-stone.\r\n\r\n27. In the Afternoon we weighed out of _Livorne_ Road, and sailed by\r\nthe Islands _Gorgonia_ and _Capraria_, seeing _Corsica_ at a distance.\r\n\r\n28. We lay beating at Sea all this Day, the Wind being contrary.\r\n\r\n29. This Day we were forced back, the contrary Winds still continuing.\r\n\r\n30. We weighed a second time, and sailed by three small Islands,\r\n_Capraria_, _Planasia_, and _Monte Christi_. We saw also _Gigio_ and\r\n_Sanuti_, two other small Islands near the Main: but we made but little\r\nway, by reason of ill Weather for 4 or 5 Days.\r\n\r\n_Novemb. 5._ At Evening we saw the Eruptions of Fire from _Stromboli_,\r\nwhich lies to the N. W. of _Sicily_. Sometimes it flamed very bright\r\nLight as a _Beacon_, at other times there appeared only a glorious kind\r\nof Light, like that of an ordinary Star when the Air is thick and hazy.\r\nThey say that it flames most in rainy Weather.\r\n\r\n6. In the Morning we were up within a League of it, and plainly\r\nperceived it to smoke. It is of a round figure, and, as we gathered,\r\nmay be about three or four Miles in compass. It bore W. by S. of us.\r\nNot far from it lye scattered several other Islands, called by the\r\nAncients _Æoliœ_ and _Vulcaniœ_: among which are _Lipara_, a long\r\nflattish Island, and _Vulcanello_, which smokes most. This Afternoon we\r\ncame to an Anchor in eight Fathom Water in the _Phare_ of _Messina_,\r\nin the mid Stream between _Scylla_ and _Charybdis_: a violent and\r\nstrong Current setting against us, and the Wind not high enough, so as\r\nto be able to stemm it. The breadth of the _Strait_ from _Messina_\r\nto _Rhegium_ may be about a League. The Land is very high on the\r\n_Calabrian_ side, where are very steep Rocks, and great depth of Water,\r\nabove 150 Fathom, as they told us: but on the _Sicilian_ side, near\r\n_Charybdis_ Shole-water, and usually an Eddy. On the Sandy Banks stands\r\nthe Phare or Watch-tower. Several Currents meeting in this narrow\r\nPassage, cause a great rippling of the Water: and great quantity of\r\nWater coming in, as the Winds drive, in great quantity meeting with the\r\nShole, is broken into Waves. The Eddies here are caused by the meeting\r\nof the different Currents by which the Waters are sometimes carried\r\nN. and sometimes S. the great danger is, lest they drive the Ship on\r\neither side. We have had Lightning for seven or eight Nights together.\r\n\r\n7. We sail'd by _Ætna_, now called _Mongibel_, where the Sea widens ten\r\nor eleven Leagues over. Now we see plainly the Smoke briskly issuing\r\nout of the _Crater_, the _Limbus_ of which was all black. The uppermost\r\npart of the Mountain was covered with Snow, except some streaks of\r\nAshes, as we judge, which lie as it were in a Gutter, spread here and\r\nthere.\r\n\r\n8. We espied a _Saettia_ at about 3 Leagues distance, and making up to\r\nher, found her forsaken. The Captain sent several Seamen on board, and\r\ncarried the Vessel to _Smyrna_.\r\n\r\nScanty Wind for several Days: and the Lightning still continued.\r\n\r\n13. We were up with _Cape Modona_, the Southernmost Cape of the\r\n_Morea_, and sailed by _Coron_. The Land very high, the Hills of\r\n_Arcadia_ lying Eastward from us. The Weather excessive hot at\r\nthis time, as it is in _England_ at _Midsummer_. We espied from\r\nour Maintop-mast five Sail of great Ships, which we supposed to be\r\n_Tripolines_, who did not think fit to come up and speak with us. But\r\nafterward we heard for certain, that they were part of the _Venetian_\r\nFleet.\r\n\r\n14. We lay for the most part becalmed over against _Cape Matapan_: but\r\nin the Evening the Wind blowing fresh, we sailed between the Island of\r\n_Cerigo_ and the Main Land of _Greece_; it being about three Leagues\r\nover to _Cape Angelo_.\r\n\r\n15. We entred the Arches, and steered through the North Channel,\r\nleaving _Melo_ and _Antimelo_ on the Starboard-quarter, at some Leagues\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n16. Betimes in the Morning we were athwart _Negropont_, and sailed\r\nbetween it and _Andros_. The _Bocca_ lies S. W. and N. E.\r\n\r\n17. We sailed by _Chios_ or _Scio_, which is very mountainous toward\r\nthe middle. It is about four Leagues distant from _Cape Caraboroun_,\r\nor the _Cape of the black Nose_, as the _Turkish_ word signifies,\r\nwhich the Seamen, in their usual way of corrupting Names, call _Cape\r\nJobbernoule_, the _Corinœum_ of the Ancients, a Promontory of the\r\nfamous Mountain _Mimas_, which runs along the Southern side of the _Bay\r\nof Smyrna_.\r\n\r\nThis Day the _Smyrna_ Fleet from _England_ comes up to us very luckily,\r\nto our great Satisfaction and Joy.\r\n\r\n18. We are now got into the _Bay of Smyrna_, and come to an Anchor\r\nwithout the Castle, not far from St. _Jacomo's Point_, as the Seamen\r\ncall it, or rather _Sangiac Point_. In the Afternoon the Consul, with\r\nseveral Gentlemen of the Factory, came to wait upon my Lord Ambassador,\r\nand desired his Lordship to defer his Entrance into _Smyrna_ till the\r\nTwentieth, that he might be received with greater Honour. That Evening\r\nwe heard a great howling of _Jackalls_ upon the Hills.\r\n\r\n20. The Consul with the Nation, accompanied with his _Druggermen_ and\r\n_Janizaries_ in their _Habit_, together with several _French_, _Dutch_\r\nand _Genoese_ Merchants, residing in that famous Emporium, came to the\r\nVillage near the Castle, who there expected us with Horses. Upon our\r\ngoing ashore, the _Leopard_ fired fifty one Guns. We made about 140\r\nHorse; and immediately upon our setting forth, we rode for about three\r\nMiles together under the Hill to the S. W. of _Smyrna_; the places\r\nadjoyning set thick with Olive, Fig, and Almond-trees. Afterwards\r\nwe clambered over some rocky Ascents; but the Horses of the Country\r\nbeing sure-footed, we were in no danger of falling. Some little way\r\nwe were forced to ride on the Sea-shore, and soon after came to the\r\nJews burying place, whose Monuments lie flat upon the ground. As soon\r\nas we entred into the City, we found the Streets full of _Greeks_,\r\n_Armenians_, _Turks_, and _Jews_, whom Curiosity had drawn together to\r\nsee and observe our Cavalcade; the _English_ Ships, which were in the\r\n_Bay_, firing their Guns, as we past near the Shore. And so after three\r\nhours riding the Ambassador was brought to the Consul's House, where\r\nLodgings were provided for him. During our stay we met with not only\r\nkind, but very noble Entertainment from the worthy Gentlemen of the\r\nFactory.\r\n\r\n_Decemb. 8._ We took our leave of _Smyrna_, being accompanied by the\r\nConsul and Merchants on board the _London-Merchant_, Capt. _John\r\nHill_ Commander, the _Leopard_ being ordered to go no further than\r\n_Smyrna_, it being feared in _England_, that if she had sailed up to\r\n_Constantinople_, the _Turks_ might have press'd her for their Service\r\nin _Candia_, which they were then besieging.\r\n\r\n9. This Morning we weighed betimes, and sailed between _Scio_ and\r\n_Mytilene_. But on the\r\n\r\n10. We were forced back near the long Island within the Bay, being\r\nunwilling to go to _Scio_, the _Tripolines_ and _Turkish_ Galleys lying\r\nthere. Here we lay ten Days, expecting a fair Wind.\r\n\r\n20. The Wind coming about and favouring us, we sailed a second time\r\nbetween _Scio_ and _Mytilene_.\r\n\r\n21. We past by _Lemnos_, and were up with the Island _Tenedos_; a fine\r\nChampaign Country, only with one Hill toward the middle of it. The\r\nCastle to the N. E. part of the Isle: over against which lye three\r\nsmall Islands in a strait Line. Here we came to an Anchor. We saw the\r\nRuins of _Troas_ at a distance, but did not think it safe to go ashore.\r\n\r\n22. The Wind coming about at S. we entred the _Hellespont_, which\r\nmay be about two Leagues and a half over. The Castles built upon\r\nthe opposite points of Land, about 11 or 12 Years before, after the\r\ngreat Defeat given the _Turkish Armata_ at the _Dardanels_ by the\r\n_Venetians_; _Cape Janizary_ on the _Asian_ side; which, with the\r\n_Philæum_, makes a tolerable good Bay for ordinary Vessels. The\r\nnarrowest Strait of the _Hellespont_ is at the two other Castles,\r\ndistant about six Leagues, where it may be about ¾ of a Mile wide.\r\nThese the _Christians_ call the _Dardanelli_; at which are situate the\r\nTowns, _Sestus_ and _Abydus_, famous in _Greek_ Poesie. These Castles\r\nwe saluted with our Guns and Trumpets, as we did the first: but each,\r\nwhether out of Pride, or out of Covetousness, to save the _Grand\r\nSignior_'s Powder, return'd us no more than two Guns. The Wind blowing\r\nvery fair we sailed into the _Propontis_.\r\n\r\n23. We passed by St. _Stephano's Point_, where we had a full view of\r\nthe S. E. Angle of _Constantinople_, which being situated upon several\r\nHills to a mighty advantage, what with the Cypress-Trees intermixed,\r\nand what with the gilded Spires of the _Moschs_, yielded us a very\r\ndiverting glorious Prospect. Passing by the _Seraglio Point_, which we\r\nsaluted by a discharge of several Guns, in the mid Stream between it\r\nand the _Tophana_, we came to an Anchor.\r\n\r\n26. On St. _Stephen_'s Day the Ambassador landed at _Galata_, (having\r\nbefore been visited by the Earl of _Winchelsea_, and the Merchants\r\nresiding there) and was received there by the _Chiaus Basha_ and the\r\n_Vaivod_ of _Galata_, the _Janizaries_ and _Chiauses_ attending, and\r\nwas waited upon by them to his Palace: and soon after the _Kaimacam_,\r\nor Governor of _Constantinople_, sent an Officer to Complement him upon\r\nhis Arrival; the _Grand Signior_ being then at _Larissa_ in _Thessaly_.\r\n\r\n_January 2._ The Ambassadors, Old and New, went over to\r\n_Constantinople_, that Morning being assigned by the _Kaimacam_ to\r\ngive them Audience, the _Chiaus Basha_ and other Officers attending at\r\nthe Water-side to receive them; Horses being brought thither for them\r\nand their Followers to mount. This _Kaimakam Jusuph_, a little old\r\nMan, had formerly been a Page of the Chamber, and chief Falconer, and\r\nafterwards _Basha_ of _Silistria_. He entertained the Ambassadors and\r\ntheir Company with Perfumes, Coffee, and Sherbet, and distributed about\r\nfifteen _Koftans Orrests_ among them: after about an Hours stay they\r\ntook their leave.\r\n\r\nBeing upon the Coasts of _Greece_ about _August_ or _September_ 69. in\r\nthe Latitude of 35°. 53´. we found by our _Azimouth_ Compass, that we\r\nhad Westerly variation there 5°. 22´.\r\n\r\nThe variety of Colours of the Sea-Water at several times chiefly\r\ndepends upon the Wind and Weather, and the reflexion of the Light\r\nupon it. It's usual and most natural Colour is a deep Green: but in\r\nCloudy and Rainy Weather, the Surface of the Water appears blackish.\r\nOn the _Goodwins_ upon the Tide of Flood, the Water was white, the\r\nWaves by reason of the Shallows, meeting with opposition, and breaking\r\ninto Foam, till the Flood is well advanced. Sometimes the Water is\r\nof a perfect Azure colour, as we observed for several Weeks in the\r\n_Mediterranean_. The Sun shining bright upon the Water, sometimes the\r\nupper part of the Waves appears Purplish, sometimes Reddish; though in\r\nShallows perchance it may receive this latter Tincture also from the\r\nSands which lie under it. When the Wind has freshened, and the Ship has\r\nbeen under full Sail, I have observed the Waves to the head, and at the\r\nsides of the Ship, to appear with a pale kind of brightness: and at\r\n_Malaga_, and at my return, going on board our Ship, which lay about\r\nhalf a League from the shore, at Night, the Wind then at East, the\r\nBoats Crew letting their Oar fall roughly into the Water, diverted us\r\nas it were with the sight of a continued Flame, raised by their rowing;\r\nwhich I ascribe rather to the Saline Particles of the Sea-Water, which\r\nwere then put into a violent Agitation, than to the Spawn of Fish, as\r\nsome of our Company imagined.\r\n\r\nSailing toward the West of _Portland_, we saw several _Porpisces_\r\nplaying with their Heads above Water; which I mention only, because\r\nthe Seamen look upon them as fore-runners of a Storm; the Wind soon\r\nafter blowing very hard at North by East. And afterwards arriving at\r\n_Constantinople_, the Wind blowing a stiff Gale at North, I observed\r\nwith a pleasing kind of astonishment good part of the _Propontis_, that\r\nis, from the _Seraglio Point_ toward the Islands, which lye against the\r\n_Bay of Nicomedia_, Eastward and South-East from us, as far as we could\r\nsee, covered as it were with _Porpisces_, which appeared every where in\r\ngreat abundance. So that I am very apt to believe that _Julius Solinus_\r\nin _Chap._ 12. of his _Polykister_ is to be understood of _Porpisces_,\r\nand not of _Dolphins_, now properly so called, though that be his Word,\r\nspeaking of the _Bosphorus_ and _Propontis_: _Hæc profunda Delphinas\r\nplurimos habent_: and soon after, _ante omnia nihil velocius habent\r\nmaria, sic ut plerunque transvolent vela navium_. I could not hear that\r\nany _Dolphins_ are caught in those Seas by the _Greeks_, whose Poverty,\r\nadded to the love which their Nation has for Fish, and the advantage\r\narising thence, upon the account of their solemn Fasts and Abstinences\r\nfrom all Flesh, even to a wonderful strictness and scrupulosity,\r\nhas made them excellent Fishermen: nor did I ever see any in their\r\nFish-Markets, or see one of them brought to the Ambassador's Table by\r\nthe Proveditor for curiosity: Though otherwise it is an excellently\r\nwell tasted Fish, especially when soused. I allow, that they will swim\r\nvery swiftly, as do the _Porpisces_; and that they will follow a Ship\r\nfor several Leagues together: but then they Swim somewhat deep in the\r\nWater, sometimes are catch'd, though not often. The Seamen have reached\r\nthem with a Fisgig, a kind of barbed Iron, at the End of a Pole tied\r\nfast to a Rope, and have made good Chear with them. But this is only my\r\nConjecture, with which I end my Journal.\r\n\r\n                                                   _Deo Servatori Laus._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Historical Observations relating to _Constantinople_. By the\r\n    Reverend and Learned _Tho. Smith_, D. D. Fellow of _Magd. Coll.\r\n    Oxon._ and of the _Royal Society_._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Constantinople_, formerly _Byzantium_, was[1] by _Constantine_ the\r\nGreat, called so after his own Name, who being mightily pleased with\r\nthe beautiful and advantageous situation of the Place between two\r\nSeas, and defended by narrow Streights on both sides, removed the Seat\r\nof the Empire hither, and laid the foundation of its future Splendor\r\nand Greatness. It was also by a[2]special Edict or Law of the same\r\nEmperor, which he caused to be engraven on a Marble Pillar, placed\r\nnear his own Statue on Horse-back, in one of the Piazza's of his new\r\nbuilt City called _Strategium_, where the Soldiers used to Muster,\r\nas in the _Campus Martius_, called _second or new Rome_, in emulation\r\nof old _Rome_, which he designed and endeavoured this should equal in\r\nall things. Accordingly he endowed it with the same Priviledges and\r\nImmunities, and established the same number of Magistrates and Orders\r\nof People, and divided the whole extent of it into fourteen Precincts\r\nor[3]Regions, according to the division of _Rome_. And the _Greek_\r\nWriters were as elegant and extravagant in their commendations of\r\nit; but the usual Title in their ordinary Discourses and Writings,\r\nwhen they had occasion to mention it without any flourish, was ἡ\r\nβασιλευούσα, ἡ βασιλίς, that is, the Imperial City, to the same sense\r\nwith that of[4]_Sidonius Apollinaris_,\r\n\r\n    _Salve sceptrorum columen, Regina orientis,\r\n    Orbis Roma tui._\r\n\r\nThe Country about it was afterwards called _Romania_ in a limited and\r\nrestrained sense, (for that _Romania_ was anciently the same with\r\n_orbis Romanus_, seems clear from[5]_Epiphanius_) and the People\r\nΡωμαῖοι. But I suppose this was not done till about the middle times\r\nof the Empire, when it began to decline. The _Greeks_ still retain\r\nthis Name. For if you ask any of the _Greeks_ born upon the Continent\r\nof _Thrace_, what Country Man he is? he answers forthwith, Ρωμαῖος\r\n_Romios_, for so they pronounce it. The _Turks_ in like manner call\r\na _Greek_ Christian _Urum Gaour_, or the Roman Infidel, as they will\r\ncall sometimes the Emperor of _Germany_, _Urumler Padisha_ or Emperor\r\nof the _Romans_. Hence it was, that the latter _Græcian_ Emperors\r\nstiled themselves βασιλεῖς Ρωμαίων, Kings of the Romans, that is, such\r\nas were Born in _Romania_ and the other Countries, which made up the\r\nEastern division of the Empire. Tho' perchance by this flourishing\r\nTitle they pretended a right to the Government of the West: Upon\r\nwhich vain presumption they assumed also the Title of Κοσμοκράτορες,\r\nor Emperors of the World, as if they had been the true Successors of\r\n_Augustus_, and the Western Emperors, Usurpers, whom they called by way\r\nof contempt and indignation, Ρῆγες, Reges, as[6] _Luitprandus_ informs\r\nus in the accompt of his Embassy to _Nicephorus Phocas_, and afforded\r\nthe People of _Italy_ no other Title than that of[7]_Longobards_ or\r\n_Lombards_. The present _Greeks_ call all the Western Christians\r\nΛατῖνοι or φράγγοι _Latins_ or _Franks_, the _Turks_ only making use of\r\nthe latter, when they speak civilly of us, and calling _Christendom_\r\n_Phrenkistan_, in the present _Greek_ φραγγία. The _Turks_ now as\r\nproudly call _Constantinople_ _Alem pena_, or the refuge of the World:\r\nWhere indeed seems to be a medley of all or most Nations of three parts\r\nof it, and of all Religions, which are allowed to be publickly profest\r\nand exercised every where throughout the Empire, except the _Persian_.\r\nFor they look upon it as a corruption of, and deviation from the Rules\r\nand Doctrine of _Mahomet_, their great false Prophet, and therefore\r\nabsolutely forbid it, as repugnant to, and destructive of the Doctrine\r\nof Life and Salvation, as they speak. And accordingly they condemn with\r\nall imaginable fury the Professors of it, who pretend to follow _Ali_,\r\nas Sectaries and Apostates, and entertain worse Opinions of them,\r\nthan of _Christians_, or _Jews_ or _Infidels_. The _Persians_ are not\r\nbehind-hand with them in their hatred and disrespect, deriding them as\r\ngross and stupid, and looking upon them as little less than barbarous;\r\nInterest and Zeal for their several Tenets heightning their differences\r\nso much, that in time of War they destroy one anothers _Moschs_. I\r\nremember, that there was a great Discourse in _Constantinople_ among\r\nthe _Turks_ concerning an impudent hot-headed _Persian_, who publickly\r\nin the new _Mosch_ built by the Mother of the present Emperor, asserted\r\nthat _Ali_ was equal to _Mahomet_. But it seems he very luckily made\r\nhis escape out of their Hands, at which the Priests and the more\r\nzealous _Turks_ were very much scandalized.\r\n\r\nThe _Greeks_ have twenty six Churches within the Walls of the City,\r\nbesides 6 in _Galata_, of which I have given an Account elsewhere. They\r\nhave also two Churches at _Scutari_, one at _Kadikui_ or _Chalcedon_.\r\nSo at _Staurosis_, _Chingilkui_, and several other Villages upon the\r\nAsian Shore off the Bosphorus, as at _Beshictash_, _Ortakui_, _Chorouch\r\nchesme_, which Church is dedicated to St. _Michal_ the Archangel,\r\n_Jenikui_ or _Neochorion_, _Therapia_, _Bujukdere_, and other Villages\r\non the _European_ side. They have also a Church at _Haskui_, where is\r\ntheir Burying place, and another near the _Bagnio_, dedicated to St.\r\n_Parasceve_. And at _Tatoula_ about a Mile from _Pera_, upon a Hill,\r\nwhich from the Name of the Church is thence called by the _Greeks_\r\nand _Franks_, St. _Demetrius_ his Hill. Next to the holy Virgin, St.\r\n_Demetrius_ and St. _George_ have most Churches dedicated to them.\r\n\r\nThe _Armenians_ have not, if I remember aright, above seven Churches;\r\nthey being few in number in comparison of the _Greeks_.\r\n\r\nThe _Jews_ may have in the City and places adjacent between twenty and\r\nthirty Synagogues, this being the greatest shelter of that accursed\r\ncontemptible People in the Grand Signiors Dominions, next to _Caire_\r\nand _Saloniki_: and I believe there may be about twenty or thirty\r\nthousand families of them. They are of great use and service to the\r\n_Turks_, upon accompt of their Brocage and Merchandise, and Industry\r\nin several mechanical Trades. All these I look upon as Natives, or\r\nSlaves rather, each paying mony for his Head every year. The _Jews_\r\nindeed very wisely collect this Tax among themselves, and according\r\nto an agreement made with the _Teftardar_ or Treasurer, pay a certain\r\nsum in gross for their whole Nation residing there: by which piece of\r\ncunning they are great gainers, and spare the poor among them less able\r\nto pay, by a contribution of the rich to make up the sum. The _English_\r\nand _Dutch_ Ambassadors have their Chappels in their Palaces common to\r\ntheir respective Nations.\r\n\r\nThe Churches and Chappels of the Western _Christians_ of the _Roman_\r\nCommunion in _Galata_, are\r\n\r\nSt. _Peters_, belonging to the _Dominicans_, where is the famous piece\r\nof _Madonna di Constantinopolis_ as the _Italians_ call it, or of the\r\nblessed Virgin, holding the holy Child _Jesus_ in her arms: which they\r\npretend to be drawn by the hand of St. _Luke_, celebrated by some of\r\nthe latter Ecclesiastical Writers to have been a famous Painter. Out of\r\nrespect to this idle tradition the credulous and superstitious _Latins_\r\nand _Greeks_ of the _Roman_ Communion shew great veneration to it,\r\nwhich otherwise hath little in it of proportion, art, or beauty, to\r\nderive any reputation upon the designer, or upon his work.\r\n\r\nSt. _Francis_, belonging to the _Conventuali_, Friars of the order of\r\nSt. _Francis_; the ground of this by the wise conduct and intercession\r\nof _Caviliere Molino_, the Venetian _Bailo_, after the surrender of\r\n_Candia_, upon the Peace made by the Republick with the Grand Signior,\r\nwas procured to be restored, and a handsome Church rebuilt with the\r\nlarge contributions of mony sent out of _Christendom_.\r\n\r\nSt. _Benedict_, belonging to the _Jesuits_, where is a rich Altar\r\ncuriously adorn'd with several figures in _Mosiack_. This Convent was\r\npurchased for them by their great Benefactor, _Henry_ the fourth of\r\n_France_.\r\n\r\nSt. _Mary_, belonging to the _Observantines_ or _Zoccolanti_, a branch\r\nof the order of St. _Francis_, so called from their going in _Zoccoli_\r\nor wooden clogs.\r\n\r\nThe _Capuchines_ have a little Chappel dedicated to St. _George_, hard\r\nby the _French_ Ambassadors Palace.\r\n\r\nSt. _Ann_, a Chappel frequented by the _Perotes_.\r\n\r\nSt. _Paul_ and St. _Anthony_, were both taken away some years since\r\nfrom the _Christians_, and turned into _Moschs_. The former of which\r\nis now known by the name of _Arab Giamesi_, or the Mosch of the\r\n_Arabians_. Our Interpreters mentioned also to me the Church of St.\r\n_John_, which the _Turks_ have seized upon for their use, St. _George_,\r\nwhich the _Jews_ are possest of, and St. _Sebastian_, which was used to\r\nbe visited chiefly on Holy days.\r\n\r\nThe North-wind blows for the most part at _Constantinople_. Which must\r\nbe ascribed to its nearness to the _Euxine_ Sea, which bears that point\r\nfrom it. So that for want of a Southwardly wind Ships have been forced\r\nto lye a month or two sometimes near the mouth of the _Hellespont_.\r\nThis was taken notice of long since by _Eunapius_ in the life of\r\n_Ædesius_, who ascribes the seldom blowing of the _South_ wind to the\r\nsituation of the mountains, whereas it is checked and overpowered\r\nby the exuberance of the Vapours continually sent forth from the\r\n_black_ and _great Sea_, as the _Greeks_ call it in comparison of the\r\n_Mediterranean_. _Vide ad finem Codini de origin. Constantinopol. Edit.\r\nParis. Pag. 80._\r\n\r\nThe _Hellespont_ is about forty miles in length, and at the Castles of\r\n_Sestos_ and _Abydos_ the streight may be about three quarters of an\r\nEnglish mile over, or less.\r\n\r\nThe length of the _Propontis_ is about a hundred and fifty miles, both\r\nshores may be seen in the middle of it. In it are,\r\n\r\n_Cyzicus_, an Island near the _Asian_ shore, to which it is joined by\r\ntwo bridges. It still retains its ancient name Κυζικὸ, and is the seat\r\nof a Bishop, being inhabited by a considerable number of _Greeks_.\r\n\r\n_Proconnesus_, not far from the former; now, as for some centuries\r\npast, called _Marmora_, from the excellent quarries of Marble there\r\nfound, the marmor _Cyzenicum_ also being famous in the time of _Pliny_.\r\n\r\n_Besbychus_, now called by the Greek καλόλιμνο, or the good haven, not\r\nfar from the entrance into the bay of _Montanea_ to the North and by\r\nEast. The _Turks_ call it _Imralme_.\r\n\r\nThere are several Islands over against the bay of _Nicomedia_, formerly\r\ncalled _Sinus Astacenus_, according to _Strabo_, about six or seven\r\nleagues from _Constantinople_.[8]\r\n\r\n_Prote_, so called because they approach first to it, coming from\r\n_Constantinople_; to the South of this _Prencipe_ and _Pytis_, which\r\nI take to be the same with _Pyrgos_, that lyes inmost toward the bay:\r\n_Chalcitis_, in modern Greek, _Chalce_ or _Chalcis_. _Oxia_ and _Platy_\r\nto the North-west. I have expressed the _Turkish_ names of the lesser\r\nand uninhabited islands elsewhere, which perchance were phantastically\r\nimposed by some _Franks_.\r\n\r\nThe _Seraglio_ is at the extreme point of the North-east Angle of\r\n_Constantinople_, where formerly stood old _Byzantium_, within which\r\ntowards the Haven is a stately _Kiosk_ or summer house, from whence\r\nthe _Grand Signior_ usually takes Barge, when he passes into _Asia_,\r\nor diverts himself upon the _Bosphorus_, at which time the _Bostangi\r\nBashi_, who hath the principal care of the Emperors palace, and hath\r\nthe command of the _Bosphorus_, sits at the helm and steers.\r\n\r\nThe seven Towers are at the South-east extremity.\r\n\r\nThe only Suburbs are to the North-west, along the Haven-side; for above\r\nthe hill, where the three walls begin, lies an open champaign Country,\r\nexcept that here and there at considerable distances farm houses are\r\nscatter'd.\r\n\r\nThe Haven runs in from the West, and so opens East.\r\n\r\nAt the East end of _Galata_ is _Tophana_, where they cast their great\r\nGuns.\r\n\r\n_Pera_ and _Galata_ have about six gates to the Seaward. The whole\r\ntract of ground was anciently, before the times of the Emperor\r\n_Valentinian_, who enclosed and fortified _Galata_ with walls and\r\ntowers, styled Περαῖα or Regio _Peræa_ being πέραν τῆς πόλεως, on the\r\nother side of the City to the North, which is the reason of its name,\r\nseated on higher hills, and whose ascent is more steep and difficult.\r\n\r\nOur modern _Geographers_, such as _Mercator_ and _Ortelius_, who\r\nherein follow _Ptolomy_, place _Constantinople_ in the Latitude of 43.\r\ndegrees and 5 minutes: the _Arabian_ and _Persian Astronomers_, as\r\n_Abulfeda_, _Nassir Edin_, _Vlugh Beigh_, and so the πρόχειροι κανόνες,\r\n_Chrysococcas_ translated out of the _Persian_ tables, place it more\r\nNortherly in 45. But by latter and better observation it is found, that\r\nthey have erred in assigning the Latitude of this City, as of several\r\nother places. To salve these differences, there is no just ground\r\nof pretence to say, that the _Poles_ are moveable and have changed\r\ntheir situation since their time, whereas it may better be imputed to\r\ntheir want of due care, or to their taking things upon trust, from\r\nthe reports of _Travellers_ and _Seamen_, not having been upon the\r\nplaces themselves: which certainly is to be said for _Ptolomy_ whose\r\nobservations, as to places more remote from _Alexandria_, are far from\r\nbeing accurate and true. The learned Mr. _John Greaves_, as I find in a\r\nManuscript discourse, very worthy of being Printed, which he presented\r\nto the most reverend and renowned _Arch-bishop Usher_, took the height\r\nof the _Pole_ at _Constantinople_ with a brass sextant of above 4 feet\r\n_radius_, and found it to be but 41 degrees 6´. but by the observation\r\nwe made in our Court-yard at _Pera_ with a very good _Quadrant_ we\r\nfound it but 40 degrees and 58 minutes of North Latitude.\r\n\r\nThere is no place between the _Propontis_ and the walls of the City,\r\nexcept just at the Seraglio-point, which may be two hundred paces in\r\nlength; where they have raised on a platform a battery for Great guns;\r\nbut from the point to the end of the Haven West, the space to the gates\r\nis unequal in some places about twenty paces broad, in others three or\r\nfour times as many more.\r\n\r\nThe distance between _Constantinople_ and _Chalcedon_ upon the\r\nopposite _Bythinian_-shore may be about three or four miles.\r\n\r\nIn the Walls are engraven the Names of several Emperors, who reigned\r\ntoward the declension of the _Græcian_ Empire, as _Theophilus_,\r\n_Michael_, _Basilius_, _Constantius Porphyrogenitus_, by whose care,\r\nand at whose expence the several breaches caused in them by the Sea or\r\nby Earthquakes, were repaired.\r\n\r\n_Kumkapi_ or the sand-gate lies toward the _Propontis_; this the\r\n_Greeks_ call in their vulgar language Κονδοσκάλι, _Contoscalium_, or\r\nthe little scale or landing-place. Here formerly was an Arsenal for\r\nGallies and other small vessels; it being a convenient passage over\r\nSea. Over this Gate was anciently engraven a curious Inscription still\r\npreserved in that excellent collection published by[9]_Gruterus_.\r\n\r\n_Jedicula Kapi_, or the Gate of the seven Towers, so called from its\r\nnearness to that _Acropolis_, is that, I guess, which the _Greeks_\r\nformerly called χρυσῆ or the Golden Gate, and by some late _Latin_\r\nWriters _Chrysea_, in _Luitprandus_, _Carea_, by a mistake either of\r\nthe Transcriber or Printer, for _Aurea_, for so certainly it must be\r\nmended. Over this Gate was this inscription,\r\n\r\n    _Hæc loca Theudosius decorat post fata Tyranni,\r\n    Aurea secla gerit, qui portam construit auro._\r\n\r\ncited by _Sirmond_ in his notes upon[10]_Sidonius_. This Gate is in\r\nthe twelfth Region, and was also called ὡραῖα from its beautiful and\r\ncurious structure.\r\n\r\nThe Gun gate formerly called Roman gate, not because it leads towards\r\nthe continent of _Romania_ or _Thrace_, but from[11]St. _Romanus_,\r\nwhere the last Christian Emperor was killed at the assault which the\r\n_Turks_ made to force their Way into the City by it.\r\n\r\nNear _Adrianople_ gate is a fair large _Mosch_ called _Ali-bassa_, upon\r\na hill accounted the highest in the City.\r\n\r\nThe distance between tower and tower in the upper wall to the landward\r\nmay be about ninety of my paces; the space between that and the second\r\nwall about eighteen paces over.\r\n\r\nThe place, where the _Lyons_, _Leopards_, and such like wild creatures\r\nare kept, (where I saw also several _Jackalls_) was formerly, as the\r\n_Greeks_ told me, a Christian Church dedicated to Παναγία or the\r\nBlessed Virgin, where this Verse is still legible,\r\n\r\n                 Κατὰ Σκυθῶν ἔπνευσας θερμὸν ἐν μάχαις.\r\n\r\nThere is no tide or running back of the water on any side of the\r\n_Bosphorus_ into the black Sea, as[12]some have imagined, whose mistake\r\nmight possibly arise hence, that the wind being at North, and blowing\r\nhard, the current sets more violently at such times against the several\r\nheadlands jetting out into the channel, which admits of several\r\nturnings, and so the waters are forced back to some little distance:\r\nor else because when the South-wind freshens and grows boisterous, it\r\nmakes a high rolling Sea in the _Propontis_ and _Bosphorous_, and being\r\ncontrary to the current, gives a check to it, so that it becomes less\r\nsensible, and is easily stemmed. Where it is narrowest, the distance\r\nseems to the eye to be scarce a mile over from one shore to another;\r\nwhere broadest, not much above a mile and a half, unless where it runs\r\ninto the deep Bays, which by reason of their shallowness only harbour\r\nBoats.\r\n\r\nThe channel certainly is natural and not cut by art, as some have idly\r\nfansied, not considering, how the _Euxine_ Sea should discharge it self\r\notherwise of those great quantities of waters, poured into it by the\r\n_Ister_ and _Tanais_, now called _Don_, and the other Rivers, whereby\r\nit becomes less salt, even very sensibly to the taste, than several\r\nparts of the _Mediterranean_.\r\n\r\nThe Fish, by a strange kind of instinct, pass in vast shoals twice a\r\nyear, Autumn and Spring, through the _Bosphorus_, that is, out of one\r\nSea into another, of which the _Greeks_, who live several months of the\r\nyear upon them, take great numbers, and supply the markets at easie\r\nrates; the Cormorants and other ravenous water-fowl, which the _Turks_\r\nwill not suffer to be destroy'd or otherwise molested, preying upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe weather in some months is very inconstant, great heats and colds\r\nhappening the same day upon the change of the wind.\r\n\r\nThe winters at _Constantinople_ are sometimes extraordinary severe. I\r\nhave heard it related by several old _Greeks_, as a thing most certain\r\nthat the _Bosphorus_ was frozen over in the time of _Achmed_, and that\r\na Hare was coursed over it. It hapned thus, that upon a thaw huge cakes\r\nof Ice came floating down the _Danube_ into the black Sea, and were\r\ndriven by the current into the _Bosphorus_, whereupon the return of the\r\nfrost, they were fixed so hard that it became passable. In the year\r\n1669 there was Ice in the Haven to the great amazement of the _Turks_;\r\nand some were so frighted at this unusual accident, that they lookt\r\nupon it as a dismal prodigy, and concluded, that the World would be at\r\nan end that Year. The _Aguglia_ or _Obelisk_ in the _Hippodrome_ is\r\nbetwixt fifty and sixty Foot high.\r\n\r\nThe Historical Pillar in _basso relievo_, raised in honour of the\r\nEmperors _Arcadius_ and _Honorius_, may be in height about an hundred\r\nseven and forty feet.\r\n\r\n_Alexius Comnenus_ lies buried in the Patriarchal Church against the\r\nwall, and his daughter _Anna Comnena_, the Historian, who lived about\r\nthe year of Christ 1117. They pretend to shew there the reliques of St.\r\n_Anastasia_, who suffered Martyrdom under the Emperor _Valerianus_, and\r\nof St. _Euphemia_, Virgin and Martyr, who lost her life most gloriously\r\nfor _Christ's_ holy religion at _Chalcedon_ under _Dioclesian_.\r\n\r\nIn _Sancta Sophia_ there are pillars so great, that a Man can scarce\r\nfathom them at twice. At the end of the Gallery, that joins the\r\nother two, each about thirty of my paces wide, there is a piece of\r\ntransparent Marble, two or three Inches thick. In the North gallery\r\nupon the Pavement is a reddish sort of a Marble Stone, brought, as the\r\n_Turks_ and _Christians_ relate, from _Palestine_, on which they Fable,\r\nthat the blessed Virgin used to wash the linnen of our Saviour.\r\n\r\nI observed but one step from the Body of the Church to the _Bema_ or\r\nplace where the Altar formerly stood.\r\n\r\nThe great _Mosch_ at _Chasim-bassa_ on _Pera_ side to the West, was\r\nformerly a Church dedicated to St _Theodosia_.\r\n\r\n_Gianghir_, a Mosch so called, upon a hill at _Fondaclee_ near\r\n_Tophana_.\r\n\r\nIn _Constantinople_ there are several narrow streets of Trade, closed\r\nup with sheds and pent-houses, which I suppose were in use before the\r\n_Greeks_ lost their Empire, and are the same with the σκεπαστοὶ καὶ\r\nφρακτοὶ δρόμοι in _Chrysaloras_ his[13]Epistle. But besides these\r\nplaces, several Trades have their distant quarters. The streets are\r\nraised for the most part on each side for the greater convenience.\r\n\r\nNot far from _Suleimania_ is the house of the _Aga_ or General of the\r\n_Janizaries_, which so often changes its Masters.\r\n\r\n_Pompey_'s pillar, as the _Franks_ erroneously call it, is of the\r\n_Corinthian_ order, curiously wrought, about eighteen foot in height\r\nand three in Diameter.\r\n\r\n_Beshiktash_, a Village within three or four miles of _Constantinople_\r\ntowards the _Bosphorus_, where lies buried the famous Pirate _Ariadin_,\r\nwhom the _Christian_ Writers call _Barbarossa_, who built here a\r\nhandsome Mosch, having two rows of Pillars at the entrance. The Captain\r\n_Bassa_ usually, before he puts to Sea with his Armata of Gallies,\r\nvisits the Tomb of this fortunate Robber, who had made several thousand\r\n_Christians_ Slaves, and makes his Prayers at the neighbouring Church\r\nfor the good Success of his expedition.\r\n\r\nThey reckon in the City above a hundred publick Baths, every street\r\nalmost affording one. They are esteemed works of great Piety and\r\nCharity; there being a continual use of them, not only upon the accompt\r\nof Religion, but of Health and Cleanliness. For their Diet being for\r\nthe most part hot spiced meats in the Winter, and crude fruits in\r\nthe Summer, their Liquor Fountain Water, or Coffee, to which we may\r\nadd their lazy kind of Life (for walking is never used by them for\r\ndigestion, or otherwise in the way of diversion) frequent bathing\r\nbecomes necessary.\r\n\r\nThere are several receptacles of Water under Ground, and one\r\nparticularly under the Church of _Sancta Sophia_, as I was informed;\r\nbut I did not think it worth my curiosity to descend into it. These\r\nwere of great use to the poor _Greeks_ in the last fatal Siege; but the\r\n_Turks_ are so secure, that they do not think, that they deserve either\r\ncost or pains to keep the Waters sweet, or the cisterns in repair.\r\n\r\nThe _Aqueducts_, which answer to those glorious _Aqueducts_, near\r\n_Pyrgos_, and convey the water to the great cistern near Sultan\r\n_Selim_'s Mosch, are in that part of _Constantinople_, which lies\r\nbetween the Mosch of _Mahomet_ the Great and _Shaxade_.\r\n\r\nThe _Turks_ began to besiege _Constantinople_ on the fifth of _April_,\r\nand took it the twenty ninth of _May_ on _Whitsun Tuesday_ morning\r\n1453. or as the _Turks_ reckon in the year 857. of the _Hegira_, or\r\nflight of _Mahomet_, the 22 day of the first _Jomad_.\r\n\r\nThe Chappel, where _Ejub Sultan_ is interred, at whose Head and Feet I\r\nobserved great wax Candles, is enclosed with latten wire Grates, for\r\nthe better accommodation of such religious _Turks_ as come to pay their\r\nrespect to the memory of this great _Musulman_ Saint. In the middle\r\nof the Area there is raised a building sustained by excellent marble\r\nPillars, ascended by two several pair of stairs, where the new Emperor\r\nis inaugurated, and where he usually goes in _Biram_-time.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Κατὰ τὴν ἐπώνυμον ἡμῖν πόλιν. _So the Emperor_ Constantine _in a\r\nLetter to_ Eusebius. de vita Constantini. _lib._ 4. _cap._ 36. & apud\r\nTheodoritum Histor.

Coll. Oxon._ and of the _Royal Society_._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Montanea_ formerly called _Nicopolis_ according to _Bellonius_, or\r\nrather _Cios_, the bay hence called _Sinus Cianus_, lies in the bottom\r\nof a Bay about Fourscore miles from _Constantinople_, and is the Scale\r\nor Landing-place for _Prusa_, from which it may be about twelve miles;\r\nin the middle way to which is the Village _Moussanpoula_.\r\n\r\n_Prusa_, now called by the _Turks_ _Bursia_, the chief City of\r\n_Bythynia_, is seated at the foot partly, and partly upon the rising\r\nof the mount _Olympus_, which is one of the highest Hills of the\r\nlesser _Asia_. Its top is covered with Snow for nine or ten Months of\r\nthe Year, several streams of Water flowing down the Hill continually,\r\naccounted very unwholesom from the Snow mixed with it. In the upper\r\npart of the City to the North-west lies the Seraglio, which is walled\r\nround; but the Emperors not residing here since their acquests in\r\n_Thrace_, or scarce making visits to this Imperial City, and none of\r\ntheir Sons living here of late, according to the former Policy of the\r\n_Turkish_ Emperors, who did not permit their Sons, when grown up, to\r\nbe near them, but sent them to some Honourable Employment, accompanied\r\nwith a Bassa and Cadi to instruct them in the Arts of War and\r\nGovernment, it lies now neglected and despoiled of all its ornaments.\r\n\r\nIn this part also are the Sepulchers of _Osman_, the founder of the\r\nFamily, which now Reigns, and his Son _Urchan_, who took the City,\r\nnear a Mosch, formerly a _Christian_ Church dedicated to St. _John_,\r\nand where was formerly a Convent of Religious, built by _Constantinus\r\nIconomachus_, where I saw the figure of a Cross still remaining upon\r\nthe Wall. Here hangs up a Drum of a vast bigness, such as they carry\r\nupon the backs of Cammels, and I suppose is one of those which they\r\nused in the taking the Place.\r\n\r\nIn the lower part, near the bottom of the Hill, _Morad_ the second, the\r\nFather of _Mahomet_ the Great, lies buried: near whereunto was formerly\r\nthe Metropolitical Church of the _Holy Apostles_. The _Bezesten_, or\r\nExchange, seems to be much better and larger than the great one at\r\n_Constantinople_, as are the several Caravanserais built for the use\r\nand accommodation of Merchants, and Travellers; in one of which, the\r\nRice Chane, I took up my quarters.\r\n\r\nWithout the City toward the East is the Mosch and Sepulcher of the\r\nEmperor _Bajazid_ the first, whom the _Turks_ call _Jilderim_ or\r\nlightning, and the Greek Writers λαίλαψ. Not far from hence is the\r\nMosch of _Mahomet_ the first, and his Sepulcher. Toward the West upon\r\nthe side of the Hill is the Mosch of _Morad_ the First, whom they call\r\n_Gazi_ or the Conqueror, near which he lies buried. There are in the\r\nwhole about 124 Moschs, several of which were formerly _Christian_\r\nChurches, and between fifty and sixty Chanes. The Castles built by\r\n_Osman_, when he besieged the City, are slighted and altogether\r\nunfortified, the one to the North, the other to the South-West.\r\n\r\nAt _Checkerghe_, about a mile and a half out of Town, are the hot\r\nBaths, much frequented both by _Christians_ and _Turks_. They are made\r\nvery Convenient to Bath in, and are covered over, that they may be used\r\nin all Weathers. Among others, there is a large round _Basin_, where\r\nthey usually divert themselves by Swimming.\r\n\r\nWhat opinions the _Turks_ have of our Blessed _Saviour_ and the\r\n_Christian_ Religion, I shall briefly shew, as they lie dispersed\r\nin several Chapters of the _Alcoran_, according to which they frame\r\ntheir Discourse, whensoever either Zeal or Curiosity puts them upon\r\nthis Topick. For _Mahomet_ upon his setting up to be the Author\r\nof a new Religion, finding such a considerable part of the World\r\nprofessing the doctrine of _Christ_, with all the Mysteries of Faith\r\ntherein contained, was cast upon a necessity of saying something both\r\nconcerning Him and It. By which it will appear, how great the Power of\r\nTruth is above Imposture and Subtility, and that as the Devils in the\r\nPossessed confess'd, though against their Wills, _Christ_ to be the\r\nSon of _God_, so this _Dæmoniack_ in the midst of all his Forgeries\r\nand Lies, and Ridiculous and Childish Narratives, not being able to\r\ncontradict the universal Belief of the _Christians_ of that, and the\r\npreceding Ages, founded on the History of the Gospel, hath been forced\r\nto give Testimony to several particulars of it.\r\n\r\nThey confess then that _Christ_ was Born of a Pure Spotless Virgin, the\r\nVirgin _Mary_, chosen by _God_ and sanctified above all the Women in\r\nthe World; and that the Angel _Gabriel_ was dispatched out of Heaven to\r\nacquaint her with the News of it. That such a kind of Miraculous and\r\nSupernatural Birth never hapned to any besides, and that _Christ_ was\r\nconceived by the _Holy Ghost_, and that he wrought mighty Miracles, for\r\nInstance, that he cleansed Lepers, gave Sight to the Blind, restored\r\nSick Persons to their Health, and raised the Dead.\r\n\r\nThat he is a great Prophet, sent by _God_ to convert Men from the\r\nVanity and Error of their false Worship to the Knowledge of the\r\ntrue _God_, to Preach Righteousness, and to correct and restore the\r\nImperfection and Miscarriages of Humane Nature; that he was of a most\r\nHoly and Exemplary Life, that he was the true Word of _God_, the\r\n_Apostle_ or _Ambassador_ of _God_; That his Gospel was revealed to\r\nhim from Heaven, and that he is in Heaven standing nigh to the Throne\r\nof _God_. They Blaspheme indeed with a Brutishness and Stupidity only\r\nbefitting _Turks_, the Mysteries of the _Holy Trinity_, and of the\r\nDivinity of our _Blessed Saviour_, and deny that he was put to Death,\r\nand say that another in his Shape was Crucified by the _Jews_, and that\r\nhe himself was assumed into Heaven in his Body without dying at all,\r\nand consequently they will not own, that he satisfied Divine Justice\r\nfor the Sins of the World; so great an affinity is there between the\r\nHeresie of _Socinus_ and profess'd _Mahometanism_.\r\n\r\nI could never yet see any _Turkish_ Translation of the _Alcoran_;\r\nthey cry up the Elegance of the Style, which being Enthusiastick and\r\nHigh-flown, by reason also of the tinkling of the Periods, is very\r\ndelightful to their Ears, who seem to be affected with Rhime mightily.\r\nThough I suppose it is upon a more Politick Account, that they are\r\nso averse, as to the translating it into their vulgar Language, not\r\nout of respect to the Sacredness of the Original only, whose full\r\ncommanding Expressions they think cannot be translated without a great\r\ndiminution to the Sense; but to keep it in greater Veneration among\r\nthe People, who might be apt to Slight and Dis-esteem it, should it\r\nbecome thus common among them. It is enough, that the Priests and\r\nLearned Men explain the difficult Passages of it to the People, and\r\nwrite Commentaries for the use of the more Curious and Inquisitive. The\r\n_Persians_ on the contrary think it no disparagement to the _Arabick_,\r\nor Profanation of the Sense, to Translate this cursed Book into their\r\nown Language, and Copies are frequent among them.\r\n\r\nThe _Grand Signior_'s Women are usually the choicest Beauties of the\r\nChristian Spoils, presented by the _Bassa's_ or _Tartars_. The present\r\n_Sultana_, the Mother of the young Prince _Mustapha_, is a Candiot;\r\nthe _Valide_ or Emperor's Mother, a _Russian_, the Daughter of a poor\r\nPriest, who with her Relations were seized upon by the _Tartars_ in an\r\nIncursion, which they made into the _Muscovites_ Country. She being\r\nreceiv'd into the _Seraglio_, by her beautiful Complexion and cunning\r\nBehaviour, gain'd the Heart and Affection of _Sultan Ibrahim_ (a Man\r\nwholly addicted to soft Pleasures, and who seldom cared to be long\r\nabsent from the Women's Apartment, but chose to spend his time among\r\nthem) having the good fortune to be the Mother of the Prince _Mahomet_,\r\nthe eldest Son of his Father, who now Reigns, she had all the Honours\r\nthat could possibly be done her, and was the beloved _Hazaki_ or chief\r\nConcubine. During this height of Splendor and Glory, the Court removing\r\nfrom _Constantinople_ to _Adrianople_, distant about an Hundred and\r\nTwenty Miles, as she was passing in great State attended with her\r\nGuards, through the Streets of the City, in a Coach, much like our\r\nCarriage-Wagons, but that they are latticed to let in the Air (for no\r\none must presume to stare or scarce look upon the Women, much less must\r\nthey themselves suffer their Faces to be seen in this jealous Country)\r\nshe out of Curiosity looking through the holes, saw a poor _Christian_\r\nSlave in a Shop, where Sugar and such like Wares were Sold. Upon her\r\nreturn she sent one of her Eunuchs to enquire for the Person, and to\r\nask him several Questions about his Country, Relations, Friends, and\r\nthe time when and how long he had been a Slave: His answers were so\r\nparticular and satisfactory, that she was soon convinc'd of the Truth\r\nand Certainty of her apprehensions, when she first cast her Eyes upon\r\nhim, that he was her Brother, and accordingly it proved so. Whereupon\r\nacquainting the Emperor with it, she immediately redeemed him from\r\nhis Patron, and having made the poor Wretch turn _Turk_, got him\r\nconsiderably preferred.\r\n\r\nThe Bassa's for the most part are the Sons of _Christians_, taken\r\ninto the _Seraglio_, near the Emperor's Person, and so are prefer'd\r\nto considerable Governments, or else they raise themselves by their\r\nConduct and Valour. _Mahomet_ Bassa in the time of _Achmet_, whose\r\neldest Daughter he Married, was the first natural _Turk_, that was made\r\nchief Vizir, having before been Captain Bassa. The chief Vizir _Mahomet\r\nKupriuli_, (who settled the Empire in the Minority of this Emperor,\r\nwhen it was ready to be shaken into Pieces, and dissolved by several\r\npowerful Factions in the State, and by the Mutinies and Discontents\r\nof the _Janizaries_ and _Saphi's_, who drove different ways) was an\r\n_Albaneze_ by Birth, the Son of a _Greek_ Priest, whom out of the\r\nheight of Zeal for _Mahomet_, he made turn _Turk_ in his Old Age, and\r\nconverted the _Christian_ Church in the Village where he was Born into\r\na Mosch. This Man also forbad the _Dervises_ to Dance in a Ring and\r\nturn round, which before was their solemn Practice at set times before\r\nthe People, which they would do so long, till they were giddy by this\r\nswift circular Motion, and fell down in a Swound, and then oftentimes\r\nupon their recovery from such Trances, they pretended to Revelation.\r\nThe Church-Men are not very kind to his Memory, looking upon him as a\r\nMan of little or no Religion; and they give out, that if he had lived,\r\nhe would have forbid their calling to Prayers from the Spires of their\r\nMoschs, and hanging out Lamps; both which they look upon as Solemn and\r\nEssential to the exercise of Religion; but he as the effect of Bigotry\r\nand Superstition.\r\n\r\nThey have a mighty Honour and Esteem for Physicians, for though they\r\nare of Opinion, that they cannot with all their Art prolong Life, the\r\nPeriod and Term of it being Fatal, and absolutely determin'd by God,\r\nyet they often consult them upon any violent Sickness or Pain, in order\r\nto make the time allotted them in this World more pleasant and easie.\r\nIt is extraordinary rare, that a natural _Turk_ makes Physick his\r\nProfession and Study. They who practice it among them, when I was in\r\n_Turky_, were for the most part _Greeks_ and _Jews_, who know nothing\r\nof Chymical Medicines, but follow the usual Methods, which they learnt\r\nin _Italy_ and _Spain_, the former having studied in _Padua_, and the\r\nlatter in _Salamanca_, where they pass for good _Catholicks_. And I\r\nremember I met with a certain _Jew_ Physician, who had been a Capuchine\r\nin _Portugal_. During the tedious Siege of _Candia_, the _Vizir_, what\r\nwith the melancholy, and what with the ill Air of the Camp, finding\r\nhimself much indispos'd, sent for a _Christian_ Physician _Signior\r\nMassalins_, a subject of the Republick of _Venice_, but Married to a\r\n_Greek_ Woman, by whom he had several Children, who was our Neighbour\r\nat _Pera_, an experienc'd able Man, to come speedily to him, and made\r\nhim a Present of about a thousand Dollars, in order to fit himself for\r\nthe Voyage and bear the expence of it. By this worthy Gentleman's Care,\r\nhe recovered his Health, and would not permit him to depart, till after\r\nthe surrendry of that City, which might be about seven Months after\r\nhis Arrival there, treating him in the mean while with all imaginable\r\nRespect. During our short stay at _Bursia_, one of our _Janizaries_\r\naccidentally discoursing with a _Turk_ about us, whom they knew to\r\nbe _Franks_, told him that there was a Physician in the Company, who\r\nhad been lately at the Grand _Signior_'s Court at _Saloniki_ with the\r\n_English_ Ambassador, and was now upon his return from _Constantinople_\r\nto _Smyrna_, where he lived. This presently took vent, and the\r\n_Turks_ thought that they had got a Man among them, that could Cure\r\nall Diseases Infallibly; for several immediately came to find us out\r\nin behalf of themselves or their Sick Friends, and one of the most\r\nconsiderable Men upon the Place, desir'd the Doctor to go to his House\r\nto visit one of his Women Sick in Bed, who being permitted to feel her\r\nnaked Pulse (for usually they throw a piece of fine Silk or Curl over\r\ntheir Womens Wrists at such times) soon discovered by that and other\r\nSymptoms and Indications of her Distemper, that opening a Vein would\r\npresently give her Ease and recover her: which he did accordingly; for\r\nwhich he received an embroidered Handkerchief instead of a Fee, and\r\ngained the Reputation of having done a mighty Cure.\r\n\r\nThey have little of Ingenious or Solid Learning among them; their\r\nchief Study, next to the _Alcoran_, being metaphysical Niceties\r\nabout the Attributes of _God_, or else the Maintenance of other odd\r\nspeculative Notions and Tenets, derived down to them from some of\r\ntheir famed Masters and Holy Men, whom they pretend to follow. Their\r\nKnowledge of the motion of the Heavens, for which the _Arabians_ and\r\nthe other Eastern Nations have been so deservedly famous, as their\r\nAstronomical Tables of the Longitude and Latitude of the fixed Stars,\r\nand of the appulse of the Moon to them, fully evince, is now very\r\nmean, and is chiefly studied for the use of Judiciary Astrology. The\r\ngreat Instrument they make use of is an Astrolabe, with which they\r\nmake very imperfect Observations, having no such thing as a Quadrant\r\nor Sextant, much less a Telescope, or any mechanical Engine, to direct\r\nand assist them in their Calculation. Their Skill in _Geography_ is\r\nas inconsiderable; I remember I heard the Captain Bassa, whom they\r\nstile Admiral of the Black and White Seas, meaning the _Euxine_ and\r\nthe _Mediterranean_, ask this silly Question; whether _England_ were\r\nout of the Streights? and at another time the _Caymican_ or Governour\r\nof _Constantinople_, hearing that _England_ was an Island, desired to\r\nknow, how many Miles it was about, in order, we supposed, to make an\r\nestimate of our King's Greatness and Strength by the extent and compass\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nOne of the great Astrologers of _Constantinople_, having heard that I\r\nhad a pair of Globes in my Chamber, made me a Visit on purpose to see\r\ntheir contrivance, being introduced by a worthy Gentleman of our own\r\nNation. After the first Ceremonies were over, I took my Terrestrial\r\nGlobe, and rectified it to the position of the Place, and pointed to\r\nthe several Circles both without and upon it, and told him in short the\r\nseveral uses of them: Then shewed him how _Constantinople_ bared from\r\n_Candia_ at that time Besieged, _Cair_, _Aleppo_, _Mecca_, and other\r\nchief Places of the Empire, with the other Parts of the World: At which\r\nhe was mightily surprized to see the whole Earth and Sea represented\r\nin that Figure and in so narrow a compass, and pleased himself with\r\nturning the Globe round several times together. Afterwards I set before\r\nhim the Celestial Globe, and rectified that, and shewed him how all\r\nthe noted Constellations were exactly described, and how they moved\r\nregularly upon their Poles, as in the Heavens; some rising, and others\r\nsetting, some always above the Horison, and others always under, in an\r\noblique Sphere, and particularly what Stars would rise that Night with\r\nus at such an Hour; the Man seemed to be ravished with the Curiosity\r\nof it, turning this Globe also several times together with his Finger,\r\nand taking a mighty Pleasure in viewing the motion of it: and yet this\r\nsilly Animal past for a Conjurer among the _Turks_, and was look'd\r\nupon as one that could foretel the events of Battels, the fates of\r\nEmpires, and the end of the World.\r\n\r\nThey have no Genius for Sea-Voyages, and consequently are very Raw\r\nand Unexperienc'd in the Art of Navigation, scarce venturing to Sail\r\nout of Sight of Land. I speak of the natural _Turks_, who Trade\r\neither into the _Black Sea_, or some part of the _Morea_, or between\r\n_Constantinople_ and _Alexandria_; and not of the Pyrats of _Barbary_,\r\nwho are for the most part Renegado's, and learn'd their Skill in\r\nChristendom, which they exercise so much to the Terror and Damage of\r\nit. A _Turkish_ Compass consists but of eight Points, the four Cardinal\r\nand four Collateral; they being at a mighty Loss how to Sail by a side\r\nWind, when by hauling their Sails sharp, they might lie their Course,\r\nand much more, when they are in the Winds Eye, not knowing how to make\r\nTacks and Bords, but choose rather to make hast into some Neighbouring\r\nPort, 'till the Wind blows fair. An _English_ and _Turkish_ Vessel both\r\nbound for the Bay of _Saloniki_, at the time of the Grand Signior's\r\nbeing there, past together out of the _Hellespont_; but foul Weather\r\nhappening, the _Turks_ got into _Lemnos_; while our Men kept at Sea and\r\npursued their Voyage, and after three Weeks stay, returned back to us,\r\nobserving in their way, that the _Turks_ remained in the same place\r\nwhere they left them, for want of a Fore-Wind to put to Sea in.\r\n\r\nThey trouble not themselves with reading the Histories of other Nations\r\nor of antient times, much less with the Study of _Chronology_, without\r\nwhich, History is very lame and imperfect; which is the cause of those\r\nridiculous and childish Mistakes, which pass current and uncontradicted\r\namong them. For instance, they make _Job_ one of _Solomon_'s Judges\r\nand (_Iscander_) _Alexander_ the great Captain General of his Army.\r\nThey number _Philip_ of _Macedon_ among the Ancestors of our _Blessed\r\nSaviour_, and believe that _Sampson_, _Jonas_, and St. _George_\r\nwere his Contemporaries. In this they are more excusable then their\r\nfalse Prophet _Mahomet_, who in his _Alcoran_ has perverted several\r\nHistorical Notices in the Writings of the Old Testament, and is\r\nguilty of vile and absurd Pseudo-chronismes. To remedy this defect,\r\nof which he was very conscious, and the better to understand the\r\nStates of _Christendom_, and the particular Kingdoms and Republicks of\r\nit, the late Great and Wise _Vizir_, _Achmet_, made his Interpreter\r\n_Panagiotti_, a Learned _Greek_, at leisure Hours, even at the Siege\r\nof _Candia_, as well as at other times, read several ancient Histories\r\nto him, and render them _Ex-tempore_ into the _Turkish_ Language,\r\nand particularly _Blaeus Atlas_, with which he was mightily pleased,\r\nand made great use of, and truly gained the Reputation of a solid\r\nand judicious States-man, as well as Souldier among the _Christian_\r\nMinisters, who in the ordinary course of their Negotiations apply'd\r\nthemselves to him.\r\n\r\nTho' their Year be according to the course of the Moon, and so the\r\n_Turkish_ Months run round the civil Year in a Circle of thirty three\r\nYears and a few odd Days, yet they celebrate the _Neuruz_, which\r\nsignifies in the _Persian_ Tongue the New Year, the twenty first Day of\r\n_March_ (on which Day the vernal Equinox was fixed by the _Greeks_ and\r\nother Oriental _Christians_, in the time of the Emperor _Constantine_,\r\nwho made no Provision for the προήγεσις ἰσημερινὴ, or Precession, which\r\nin process of Time the inequality between the Civil and Astronomical\r\nYear must necessarily produce) at which time the _Cadyes_ and other\r\nannual Magistrates, and Farmers of the Customs take Place, and reckon\r\nto that Day twelve Month again.\r\n\r\nIn their civil Deportment and Behaviour one towards another, the left\r\nHand is the more Worthy and Honourable Place, except among their\r\nEcclesiasticks; and the Reason they alledge is, because they Write from\r\nthe right Hand, and the Sword is worn on the left Side, and so is more\r\nat his disposal, who walks on that Hand. The chief _Vizir_ accordingly\r\nin the _Divan_ sits at the left Hand of the _Mufty_, each maintaining\r\ntheir Right of Precedence according to this way of decision.\r\n\r\nIn their Moschs they sit without any distinction of degrees.\r\n\r\nSome of the more zealous _Turks_ cause to be engraven on their\r\nScymitars and Bucklers a Sentence out of the sixty first _Surat_, which\r\nis concerning Fighting or Battle-array, and contains Incouragements to\r\nFight in the _Way and Paths of God_, as the Impostor Words it; for\r\nwhich he assures them, besides assistance from Heaven to help them to\r\nget the Victory over their Enemies, and that _God will Pardon their\r\nSins and bring them to Paradice_. Thus spirited with Zeal, a _Turk_\r\nlays about him with Fury, when he is a fighting, and seems ambitious of\r\ndying to gain the delights of Paradice, at least indifferent whether he\r\ndies or lives.\r\n\r\nThe _Turks_ are as to their Temper serious, or rather inclining to\r\nmorosity, seldom Laughing, which is accounted an argument of great\r\nVanity and Lightness. They perform the Exercises, which they use in\r\nthe way of Diversion, as Shooting and Hunting, with a great deal of\r\ngravity, as if they designed them more for Health than for Pleasure;\r\nand this too but seldom. The better and richer sort, who have nothing\r\nto do, sitting all Day at Home, lolling upon a Sofa or rais'd Place\r\nin their Rooms, and taking Tobacco, which their Slaves fill and\r\nlight for them: And if they retire in the Summer or Autumn, for a\r\nWeek or Fort-night to some convenient Fountain in a Wood with their\r\nWomen, it is chiefly to enjoy the Refreshments of the cool Air. In\r\nthe times of Triumph indeed for some great Success obtained against\r\nthe _Christians_, when the Shops are open for three Nights together,\r\nand hung with Lights, as well as the Spires of the Moschs in curious\r\nFigures, they are guilty of extravagant Mirth, running up and down the\r\nStreets in Companies, and sometimes Singing and Dancing after their\r\nrude way; but this fit being over, they soon return to their former\r\nMelancholy. In the Coffee-Houses where they use to resort to Tipple,\r\nthere is usually one hired by the Owners to read either an idle Book of\r\nTales, which they admire as Wit, or filthy obscene Stories, with which\r\nthey seem wonderfully affected and pleased, few of them being able to\r\nRead. These are the Schools, which they frequent for their Information,\r\ntho' in times of War, when things went ill with them, their Discourses\r\nwould be of the ill Government; and the Grand Signior himself and his\r\nchief Ministers could not escape their Censures, which manifestly\r\ntending to Sedition, and to the heightning of their Discontents by\r\ntheir mutual Complaints, and by this free venting of their Grievances\r\nduring the War at _Candia_, the Wise Vizir seeing the evil Consequences\r\nthat would follow, if such Meetings and Discourses were any longer\r\ntolerated, Commanded, that all the publick Coffee-houses should be shut\r\nup in _Constantinople_ and several other great Cities of the Empire,\r\nwhere the Malcontents used to rendezvouz themselves, and find fault\r\nupon every ill Success and Miscarriage with the administration of\r\nAffairs.\r\n\r\nThe custom of the _Turks_ to salute the Emperor or the _Vizir Bassa_'s\r\nwith loud Acclamations and Wishes of Health and long Life, when they\r\nappear first in their Houses or any publick Place, is derived from the\r\n_Greeks_, who took it from the _Romans_. This was done by them in a\r\nkind of Singing Tone; whence _Luitprandus_ Bishop of _Cremona_ tells\r\nus, that in a certain Procession (προέλυσις) at which he was present,\r\nthey Sang to the Emperor _Nicephorus_ πολλὰ ἔτη that is, many Years,\r\n(which _Codinus_, who lived just about the taking of _Constantinople_,\r\nby the _Turks_, expresses τὸ ψάλλειν τὸ πολυχρόνιον or by τὸ\r\nπολυχρονίζειν and the wish or salute by πολυχρόνισμα) and at Dinner\r\nthe _Greeks_ then present wish'd with a loud Voice to the Emperor and\r\n_Bardas_, _Ut Deus annos multiplicet_, as he Translates the _Greek_.\r\n\r\nThe _Turkish_ Coin in it self is pitiful and inconsiderable, which I\r\nascribe not only to their want of Bullion, but to their little Skill in\r\nmatters relating to the Mint. Hence it comes to pass that Zecchines and\r\nHungars for Gold, and _Spanish_ Dollars and Zalotts for Silver stampt\r\nin _Christendom_ pass current among them, most of the great Payments\r\nbeing made in them, they not caring either through Ignorance or Sloth\r\nto follow the Example of the _Indian_ or _Persian_ Emperors, who\r\nusually melt down the _Christian_ Mony imported by the Merchants into\r\ntheir several Countries, and give it a new Stamp. The most usual pieces\r\nare the Sheriphi of Gold, somewhat less in value than a _Venetian_\r\nZecchine, and Aspers; ten of which are equal to six Pence _English_,\r\nand some few three Asper Pieces. A Mangur is an ugly old Copper Piece,\r\neight of which make but one Asper, and is not I think a _Turkish_ Coin,\r\nbut rather _Greek_. They have no Arms upon their Coin, only Letters\r\nembossed on both sides, containing the Emperor's Name, or some short\r\nSentence out of the _Alcoran_.\r\n\r\nThe _Turks_ look upon Earthquakes as Ominous, as the vulgar do upon\r\nEclipses, not understanding the Philosophy of them. During my stay\r\nin _Constantinople_, which was above 2 Years, there hapned but one,\r\nwhich was _October 26. 1669._ about six a Clock in the Morning a stark\r\nCalm preceeding. It lasted very near a Minute, and we at _Pera_ and\r\n_Galata_ were as sensible of it, as those who were on the other side\r\nof the Water; but praised be God nothing fell, and we were soon rid of\r\nthe Fears in which this frightful Accident had cast us, being in our\r\nBeds, and not able by reason of the Surprize in so little a space to\r\nhave past through a Gallery down a pair of Stairs into the Court, if\r\nwe had attempted it. The _Turks_ made direful Reflexions on it, as if\r\nsome Calamity would inevitably fall upon the Empire, quickly forgetting\r\nthe great Triumphings and Rejoycings which they exprest but a few Days\r\nbefore for the Surrendry of _Candia_. In the Year 1668. in _August_,\r\nthe Earth shook more or less for forty-seven Days together in the\r\nlesser _Asia_ at _Anguri_ (_Ancyra_), and for fifteen at _Bacbasar_, as\r\nwe heard from a _Scotch_ Merchant, who liv'd there: And particularly,\r\nthat at this latter Place on the second of _August_, between three and\r\nfour of the Clock in the Afternoon it lasted for a quarter of an Hour;\r\nseveral Houses were overthrown, and some hundreds of Chimneys fell (it\r\nbeing a very populous Town) and yet there were but seven kill'd. The\r\ntrembling being so violent, both _Turks_ and _Christians_ forsook their\r\nHouses, and betook themselves to the Fields, Vineyards, and Gardens,\r\nwhere they made their Abode for several Days.\r\n\r\nTheir Punishments are very severe, this being judg'd the most effectual\r\nway to prevent all publick Disorders and Mischiefs. They use no great\r\nFormality in their Processes: If the Criminal be taken in the Fact,\r\nand the Witnesses ready and present to attest it, and sometimes if\r\nthere be but probable circumstances, without full Conviction, condemn\r\nhim; and soon after Sentence, sometimes an Hour, or less, hurry him\r\naway to Execution. For an ordinary Crime, hanging is the usual Death:\r\nBut for Robbery and Murder, committed upon the High Way by such as Rob\r\nin Parties and alarm whole Provinces, or for Sacriledge, or for any\r\nhainous Crime against the Government, either Gaunching or Excoriation,\r\nor cutting off the Legs and Arms, and leaving the Trunk of the Body in\r\nthe High Way, or Empaling, that is, thrusting an Iron Stake through the\r\nBody out under the Neck or at the Mouth; in which extreme Torment the\r\nmiserable Wretch may live two or three Days, if the Guts or the Heart\r\nhappen not to be wounded by the pointed Spike in its Passage. This\r\nPunishment seems to have been in use among the _Romans_, _Seneca_'s\r\nEpist. 14. _Cogita hoc loco carcerem, & cruces, & eculeos, & uncum, &\r\nadactum per medium hominem, qui per os emergat, stipitem_: and so in\r\nhis Book _De Consolatione ad Marciam cap._ 20. _Ali capite conversos\r\nin terram suspendere: Alii per obscena stipitem egerunt: Alii brachia\r\npatibulo explicuerunt._ Murder is seldom Pardon'd, and especially if\r\nthe Relations of the Murder'd Person demand Justice.\r\n\r\nThe Circumcision, tho' it be a Sacred Right, is perform'd in their\r\nprivate Houses, and never in the Moschs.\r\n\r\nThe Women colour their Eye-Brows and Lids with an ugly black Powder,\r\nI suppose, to set off their Beauty by such a Shadow; and their Nails\r\nwith the Powder of _Kanna_, which gives them a Tincture of faint Red,\r\nlike Brick (as they do the Tails and Hoofs of Horses) which they look\r\nupon as a great Ornament. Their great diversion is Bathing; sometimes\r\nthrice, if not four times a Week. They do not permit them to go to\r\nChurch in time of Prayer, for fear they should spoil their Devotion:\r\nThe _Turks_ being of so brutish a Temper, that their Lust is rais'd\r\nupon the sight of a fair Object. They are call'd oftentimes by the\r\nNames of Flowers and Fruits, and sometimes Phantastick Names are\r\ngiven them, such as _Sucar Birpara_, or bit of Sugar, _Dil Ferib_, or\r\nRavisher of Hearts, and the like.\r\n\r\nTheir Skill in Agriculture is very mean. In their Gardens they have\r\nseveral little Trenches to convey Water, where it may be most necessary\r\nfor their Plants and Flowers. They know little or nothing of manuring\r\ntheir Grounds: Sometimes they burn their Fields and Vineyards after\r\nHarvest and Vintage, partly to destroy the Vermin, and partly to enrich\r\nthe Soil. They tread out their Corn with Oxen, drawing a square Plank\r\nBoard, about a Foot and a half or two Foot over, studded with Flints,\r\nand winnow it upon their threshing Floors in the open Air, the Wind\r\nblowing away the Chaff. They feed their Horses with Barly and chopt\r\nStraw; for I do not remember ever to have seen any Oats among them; and\r\nthey make but little Hay.\r\n\r\nFor Draught of great Weight in their Carts they make use of Buffalo's.\r\n\r\nCamels will endure Travel four Days together without Water, and\r\nwill eat tops of Thistles, Shrubs, or any kind of Boughs: They are\r\nvery sure-footed, and kneel when they are a loading, and live to a\r\nconsiderable number of Years, some even to sixty.\r\n\r\nThe chief Furniture of their Houses are Carpets or Mats of _Grand\r\nCairo_, neatly wrought with Straw, spread upon the Ground; they having\r\nno occasion of Chairs, Couches, Stools, or Tables; their postures\r\nwithin Doors, being different from ours. They have no Hangings, but\r\ntheir Walls are whited and set off with Painting, only adorn'd with a\r\nkind of Porcelane; no Beds clos'd with Curtains.\r\n\r\nThey seal not with Wax, but Ink, at the bottom of the Paper the\r\nEmperor's Name being usually written with Flourishes and in perplext\r\nCharacters: Nor have they any Coats of Arms upon their Seals, there\r\nbeing no such thing as Gentility among them.\r\n\r\nSome of them, notwithstanding their Zeal for _Mahomet_ and the Religion\r\nby him establish'd, retain not only a favourable and honourable Opinion\r\nof our Blessed _Saviour_, but even place some kind of Confidence in\r\nthe usage of his Name, or of the Words of the Gospel, tho' it may seem\r\nto be wholly in the way of Superstition. Thus in their Amulets, which\r\nthey call _Chaimaili_, being little bits of Paper of two or three\r\nFingers breadth, roul'd up in pieces of Silk, containing several short\r\nPrayers or Sentences out of the _Alcoran_, with several Circles with\r\nother Figures, they usually inscribe the Holy and Venerable Name of\r\n_JESUS_, or the Figure of the Cross, or the first Words of St. _John_'s\r\nGospel, and the like; they hang them about their Necks, or place them\r\nunder their Arm-pits, or in their Bosom near their Hearts (being the\r\nsame with what the _Greeks_ call ἐγκόλπια) and especially when they go\r\nto War, as a preservative against the Dangers of it; and indeed against\r\nany misfortune whatsoever. Some have them sow'd within their Caps: And\r\nI heard of a _Turk_, who was so superstitious herein, that he always\r\npluck'd it off, and was uncover'd when he had occasion to make Water.\r\nSome are such Bigots in their Religion, and so furious against the\r\nChristians, that not only do they treat them with all imaginable Scorn\r\nand Contempt, but take it ill to be salam'd or saluted by them, as if\r\nit were the effect of Sawciness or unbecoming Familiarity. Their Malice\r\nagainst the Christians makes them envy the rich Furs they line their\r\nVests with, and it is a trouble to these hypocritical Zealots to see\r\nthe _Franks_ ride upon their fine _Arabian_ Horses.\r\n\r\nThe respect which they shew the _Alcoran_ is wonderful: They dare not\r\nopen the Leaves of it with unwashen Hands, according to the Advice or\r\nCommand written in _Arabick_ upon the Cover, _Let no one touch this\r\nBook, but he that is clean_. They kiss it, and bend their Heads and\r\ntouch their Eyes with it, both when they open it and shut it.\r\n\r\nThe _Janizaries_, when they attend upon _Christian Ambassadors_ to\r\ntheir Audience, seem to appear in their Bravery, and in a Habit far\r\nfrom that of a Soldier, being without either Fire-Arms or Swords,\r\n(which latter are not worn but in time of Service), or when they are\r\nupon a March, or embodied, wearing a Cap made of Camel's Hair, with a\r\nbroad Flap dangling behind, a gilt embroider'd Wreath running round\r\nit, and an oblong piece of Brass rising up from the middle of their\r\nForehead near a Foot, with a great Club in their Hand, like inferior\r\nOfficers of the Civil Government. But when they are in the Camp, they\r\nthrow off their upper Vest, and Turbants, which they wear at all other\r\nusual times, as troublesome, and put on a _Fess_, or red Cap, which\r\nsits close to their Head, and tuck up their _Duliman_ or long Coat, to\r\ntheir Girdle, that they may be the more quick and expedite in their\r\nCharge.\r\n\r\nThey affect finery and neatness in their Cloths and Shashes; not\r\nso much as a spot to be seen upon them, and in rainy or suspicious\r\nWeather, are very careful how they go abroad without their\r\n_Yamurlicks_, which is a kind of Coat they throw over their Heads at\r\nsuch times.\r\n\r\nTheir Pans and Dishes are for the most part of Copper, but so handsomly\r\nTinn'd over, that they look like Silver.\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of Gypsies or _Zinganies_ in _Turky_, who live\r\nthe same idle nasty kind of Life, as they do in _Christendom_, and\r\npretend to the same Art of telling Fortunes; and are look'd upon as the\r\nOff-scouring of Mankind. It is accounted the extremest point of human\r\nMisery to be a Slave to any of this sort of Cattel.\r\n\r\nThe _Haggi_, or Pilgrims, that have been at _Mecca_ and _Medina_,\r\nforbear to drink Wine most Religiously, out of a perswasion, that one\r\ndrop would efface all the Merits of that troublesome and expensive\r\nJourney; and some have been possess'd with such a mad Zeal, that they\r\nhave blinded themselves after their having been bless'd with the sight\r\nof _Mahomet_'s Sepulcher.\r\n\r\nAfter _Jatzih_, that is, an Hour and a half in the Night, throughout\r\nthe whole Year, there is as great a silence in the Streets as at\r\nMidnight: The Emperor _Achmet_ in the Year 1611. having made an Order,\r\nthat no one should presume to be out of his House after that time;\r\nwhich is to this Day most punctually observed. The _Bostangi bashi_,\r\nwho has the Command of all the _Agiamoglans_ in the _Seraglio_, the\r\n_Topgibashi_ or such great Officers attended with a great Train of\r\narmed Men, walking the Rounds, and drubbing such as they find abroad at\r\nunseasonable Hours of what Nation or Quality soever, except Physicians,\r\nChyrurgeons, and Apothecaries, whom they allow at all times to visit\r\nthe Sick.\r\n\r\nThe _Turkmans_, (for so they are peculiarly called, as if they were the\r\ntrue Descendents of the _Old Turks_ or _Scythians_, whose wandering\r\nkind of Life is described by the Poet;\r\n\r\n  Ἁμαξόβιοι { _Nulla domus, plaustris habitant, migrare per arva\r\n        { Mos, atq; errantes circumvectare penates._)\r\n\r\nhave no fixt Residence any where, but Travel with their Families and\r\nCattle from Place to Place, carrying their Wives and Children upon\r\nCamels; they pitch their Tents usually near Rivers and Fountains, for\r\nthe convenience of Water, and according as their necessities require,\r\nmake a longer or a shorter stay. Their whole Estate consists in their\r\nnumerous Flocks and Herds, which they sell upon occasion to supply\r\nthemselves with what they want, at the Towns they pass by. Their only\r\nconcern is how to enjoy the Benefits and Blessings of Nature, without\r\nthe troubles and turmoils and disquiets of Life; being contented\r\nand happy in one another's Company, void of all Ambition and Envy,\r\nCourteous and Humane to Strangers, that may want their Help and\r\nAssistance, kindly entertaining them with such Provision as their Folds\r\nafford. I have met with some Companies of these harmless Wanderers\r\nin my Travels. The Country lies open without any Inclosures, and the\r\nPropriety not being vested in any one, they Travel thro' the Plains\r\nunmolested, and find excellent Pasturage every where. The _Turks_\r\nTill no more Ground than will serve their necessities: Being supplied\r\nwith Corn from _Ægypt_, and from _Moldavia_ and _Walachia_, by the\r\nway of the _Black Sea_, letting vast Tracts of Ground lie wast and\r\nuncultivated; so that their Sloth herein sometimes is justly punished\r\nwith Dearths.\r\n\r\nThey have nothing to shew for their Houses and Possession, but an\r\n_Hogiet_ or piece of Paper subscribed by the _Cadi_, if they have\r\nacquired them by their Mony, or that they were their Fathers before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe _Dervises_ generally are Melancholy, and place the greatest part\r\nof their Religion in Abstinence and other Severities. Some cut their\r\nFlesh, others vow not to speak for six or seven Years, or all their\r\nLives long, tho' never so much provoked or distressed. Their Garments\r\nare made of a course sort of Wool or Goat's Hair: They are tied up by\r\nthe Vow of their Order ever from Marrying. Several of this Sect in the\r\nheighth of their Religious Phrenzy have attempted upon the Lives of the\r\nEmperors themselves, (at whose Government they have taken disgust) as\r\n_Mahomet_ the second, and _Achmet_, as if such desperate Attempts were\r\nfatal to Bigots in all Religions.\r\n\r\nThey pay a mighty Veneration to any Relique of _Mahomet_, his Banner\r\nis still preserved in the Treasury of the _Seraglio_, and is look'd\r\nupon as the great Security of the Empire. They believe that it was\r\nsent from Heaven, and conveyed into the Hands of _Mahomet_, by the\r\nAngel _Gabriel_, as a Pledge and Sign of Success and Victory in\r\nhis Battels against the _Christians_, and all other Enemies of the\r\n_Musulman_-Faith. It was sent to _Candia_ to encourage the Soldiers\r\nto endure the fatigue of that long and tedious Siege; and when it was\r\nbrought thence after the Surrendry of that City, to be deposited\r\nin its usual Place, the _Vizir_ gave several _Christian_ Slaves,\r\nthat row'd in the Galley that was fraught with this Holy Ware, their\r\nLiberty. They pretend to have some Rags of _Mahomet_'s Vest, to\r\nwhich they ascribe great Virtue. In confidence of which, the Emperor\r\n_Achmet_, in the time of a great Fire which raged at _Constantinople_,\r\nwhen all other means fail'd, dipt part of them in Water to be sprinkled\r\nupon the Fire to rebate the Fury of it.\r\n\r\nNext to the _Mufti_ or _Cadaleskires_ are the _Mollas_, of which these\r\nfour are the chiefest in Dignity. The Molla of _Galata_, _Adrianople_,\r\n_Aleppo_, _Prusa_; and after them are reckoned these eight, _Stambol\r\nEphendi_, _Larissa_, _Misir_ or _Cairo_, _Sham_ or _Damascus_,\r\n_Diarbekir_ or _Mesopotamia_, _Cutaia_, _Sophia_, _Philippi_.\r\n\r\nThe Priests have no Habit peculiar to their Profession, whereby they\r\nare distinguish'd from others. If they are put from their Moschs for\r\nmiscarriage or neglect of doing their Duty, or if they think fit to\r\nresign and be Priests no longer, they may betake themselves without\r\nany Scandal to secular Employments, their former Character and Quality\r\nwholly ceasing. While they remain Priests, they counterfeit a more than\r\nordinary Gravity in their Discourse and Walking: and affect to wear\r\nTurbants swelling out, and made up with more cross folds: which was all\r\nthe difference which I could observe by their Head Attire, which is\r\nvarious, tho' I could not find that this was constantly and strictly\r\nobserved.\r\n\r\nIn _Byram_ time, which is the great Festival of the Year, at which time\r\nevery one looks cheerfully and merrily, among other signs of mutual\r\nRespect, they besprinkle one another with sweet Water. They indulge to\r\nseveral Sports: and some are mightily pleased with swinging in the open\r\nAir, the ordinary sort of People especially, paying only a few Aspers\r\nfor the diversion.\r\n\r\nThe Government is perfectly Arbitrary and Despotical; the Will and\r\nPleasure of the Emperor having the force and power of a Law, and\r\noftentimes is above it. His bare Command without any process is\r\nenough to take off the Head of any Person, (tho' never so Eminent in\r\nDignity, tho' usually for formality and to silence the Murmurings of\r\nthe Soldiery and People, the Sentence is confirm'd by the _Mufti_)\r\nsometimes _Bassa_'s who have amassed great Treasures in their\r\nGovernments, are cut off in their own Houses in the midst of their\r\nRetinue, the Messengers of Death producing the Imperial Command,\r\nusually sent in a black Purse, and not a Sword drawn in their Defence.\r\nOthers, if they are obnoxious to the least Umbrage or Jealousie,\r\ntho' dismist the _Seraglio_ with all possible demonstrations of the\r\nGrand _Signior_'s Favour, and with Rich Presents in order to take\r\npossession of Places of great Command in the Empire, before they\r\nhave got two or three Days Journey from _Constantinople_, have been\r\novertaken and strangled. In the Army Commands are given according to\r\nMerit, Courage and Conduct are sure to be rewarded, the way lying\r\nopen to the meanest Soldier to raise himself to be the chief of his\r\nOrder. But other Preferments depend upon meer Chance, and upon the\r\nfansie of the Emperor, whether the Person be fit or no, and they are\r\nas soon lost. The least ill Success or Miscarriage proves oftentimes\r\nfatal, and a more lucky Man is put in his Place, and he succeeded by\r\na third, if unfortunate in a Design, tho' managed with never so much\r\nPrudence and Valour. They admit of no hereditary Honours, and have\r\nno respect to Descent or Blood, except the _Ottoman_ Family: He only\r\nis Great and Noble, whom the Emperor favours, and while his Command\r\nlasts. According to a tradition, that passes current among them, a\r\nBassa's Son by a _Sultana_ or a Daughter or Sister of the Emperor can\r\nrise no higher than to be a _Sangiac-bei_ or Governor of some little\r\nProvince, much inferior to a Bassa and under his Jurisdiction. Being\r\nborn of Slaves for the most part, they do not pride themselves in their\r\nBirth, very few among them being scarce able to give any account of\r\ntheir Grandfathers. They have no Sirnames, but are distinguish'd by\r\ntheir Possessions and places of Abode, and enjoying by Law a Liberty\r\nof having what Women they please, they have little or no regard to\r\nAlliance or Kindred.\r\n\r\nTheir Empire owes the continuance of its being to the severity of\r\nthe Government, which oftentimes takes place without regard either\r\nto Justice or Equity, and to their frequent Wars, which prevent all\r\noccasions of Mutiny and Faction among the Soldiers, which happen\r\nfrequently when unimploy'd. So that tho' Ambition may put a warlike\r\nSultan upon enlarging his Territories by new Conquests, yet reason\r\nof State forces a weak and effeminate Prince, such as was _Ibrahim_,\r\nto make War for his own Security. Their Politicks are not owing to\r\nBooks and Study and the Examples of past times, but to Experience and\r\nthe plain Suggestions of Nature and common Sense: They have Rules of\r\nGovernment, which they firmly adhere to, holding the Reins strait,\r\nespecially being cruel and inexorable to Criminals of State, who never\r\nare to expect any Mercy or Pity. Their Councils formerly were open, and\r\ntheir Designs known, and proclaimed before Hand, as if this had been\r\na Bravery becoming their Greatness, and that they scorned to steal a\r\nConquest. But they have learned since the Art of dissimulation, and can\r\nLie and Swear for their Interest, and seem excessive in their Caresses\r\nto the Ministers of those Countries, which they intend to Invade. But\r\ntheir preparations for Arming are made with so much Noise, that an\r\nordinary Jealousie is soon awakened by it to oppose them, in case of\r\nan Attack. They seldom or never care to have War at both Extremes of\r\nthe Empire at the same time, and therefore they are mighty sollicitous\r\nto secure a Peace with _Christendom_, when they intend a War upon the\r\n_Persians_: And as much as is possible, they avoid quarrelling with two\r\nChristian Princes at once, being usually at League either with _Poland_\r\nand _Muscovy_, when they War upon _Hungary_, and so on the contrary;\r\ndreading nothing more than an Union of the _Christian_ Princes,\r\nbordering upon them, which would prove so fatal to their Empire, and\r\nquickly put a Period to their Greatness. For hereby they would be\r\nput upon a necessity of making a defensive War to their great Loss\r\nand Disadvantage, and at last either be forced to beg a Peace of the\r\n_Christians_, or run the hazard of losing all, by a further Prosecution\r\nof War.\r\n\r\nThis they are very sensible of, and therefore as they take all occasion\r\nto promote Quarrels and Dissentions in _Hungary_ and _Transylvania_,\r\nso they greatly rejoyce, when the Princes of _Christendom_ are at War\r\none with another. This is their great time of Advantage, and they know\r\nthat it is their true Interest to pursue it, tho' they do not always,\r\nby reason of the ill condition of their own Affairs, make use of it.\r\nDuring the Civil Wars of _Germany_, the Bassa's and other Commanders\r\nof the Army were very importunate with the grand Signior, to make a\r\nWar on that side, and to enlarge his Conquests as far as _Vienna_, no\r\nconjuncture having been ever so favourable to consummate such a Design,\r\nin which _Solyman_ so unhappily miscarried. They promised him an easie\r\nVictory, assuring him that the Animosities of the Princes of the Empire\r\nwere so heightned, that there was no room left for a Reconciliation,\r\nthat he was but to go in the Head of an Army to take Possession, and\r\nthat _Austria_ would Surrender at the first News of his March towards\r\nit. The Emperor was not to be moved at that time by these Insinuations\r\nand plausible Discourses; being continually urged, He as often denied.\r\nOne day when they came to Renew their advice about the _German_ War, He\r\nhaving given order before, that several Dogs should be kept for some\r\nDays without Meat, commanded that they should be brought out, being\r\nalmost Starved, and Meat thrown among them, whereupon they snarled and\r\nbit one another: In the midst of their Noise and Fighting, he caused a\r\nBear to be let loose in the same Area; the Dogs forgetting their Meat,\r\nand leaving off their fighting, ran all upon the Bear, ready to Prey\r\nupon them singly, and at last killed him. This Diversion the Emperor\r\ngave his Bassa's, and left them to make the application.\r\n\r\nA certain Prophecy of no small Authority runs in the Minds of all\r\nthe People, and has gain'd great Credit and Belief among them, that\r\ntheir Empire shall be ruined by a Northern Nation, which has white and\r\nyellowish Hair. The Interpretation is as various as their Fansie. Some\r\nfix this Character on the _Muscovites_: And the poor _Greeks_ flatter\r\nthemselves with foolish Hopes, that they are to be their Deliverers,\r\nand to rescue them from their Slavery, chiefly because they are of\r\ntheir Communion, and owe their Conversion to the _Christian_ Faith to\r\nthe Piety and Zeal of the _Grecian_ Bishops formerly. Others look upon\r\nthe _Swedes_, as the Persons describ'd in the Prophecy, whom they are\r\nmost to fear. The Ground and Original of this fancy I suppose is owing\r\nto the great Opinion, which they have of the Valour and Courage of\r\nthat Warlike Nation. The great Victories of the _Swedes_ in _Germany_\r\nunder _Gustavus Adolphus_ were loudly proclaimed at _Constantinople_,\r\nas if there were no withstanding the shock and fury of their Arms: And\r\ntheir continued Successes confirmed the _Turks_ in their first belief,\r\nand their Fears and their Jealousies were augmented afterwards, when\r\n_Charles Gustave_, a Prince of as heroick a Courage, and as great\r\nAbilities in the Art and Management of War as the justly admired\r\n_Gustavus_, entred _Poland_ with his Army, and carried all before him,\r\nseized upon _Warsaw_ and drove _Casimire_ out of his Kingdom, and had\r\nalmost made an entire and absolute Conquest, only a few Places holding\r\nout. This alarmed the Grand Signior and the Bassa's of the _Port_,\r\nas if the Prophecy were then about to be fulfilled, who did not care\r\nfor the Company of such troublesome Neighbours, who might push on\r\ntheir Victories, and joyning with the _Cossacks_, advance their Arms\r\nfurther, and make their Country the seat of a War, which might draw\r\nafter it fatal Consequences. To prevent which, Couriers are dispatch'd\r\nfrom _Constantinople_ to _Ragotski_, Prince of _Transylvania_, then in\r\nconcert with the _Sweeds_, to Command him to retire with his Army out\r\nof _Poland_, as he valued the Peace and Safety of his own Country, and\r\nthe Friendship of the Grand Signior, whose Tributary he was, and by\r\nwhose Favour he had gain'd that Principality: And the _Crim-Tartars_,\r\nthe Sworn Enemies of the _Poles_, who at that time lay heavy upon them,\r\nwere wrought upon by the same Motives and Reasons of State, to clap\r\nup a Peace with them, that being freed from these Distractions, they\r\nmight unite their Forces the better together, and make Head against\r\nthe _Sweeds_.\r\n\r\nThe Ambassadors of _Christian_ Princes, when they are admitted by the\r\nGrand Signior to an Audience, (their Presents being then of course\r\nmade, which are look'd upon as due, not to say, as an Homage) are\r\ndismiss'd in few Words, and referred by him to his _Wakil_ or Deputy,\r\nas he usually stiles the chief _Vizir_: And a small number of their\r\nRetinue only permitted the Honour of kissing his Vest, and then rudely\r\nenough sent away.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Signiors keep up the State of the old _Asiatick_ Princes:\r\nThey do not expose themselves often to the View of the People, unless\r\nwhen they ride in Triumph, or upon some such solemn Occasion; when they\r\ngo to the Moschs, or divert themselves in the Fields, either in Riding\r\nor Hunting, they do not love to be stared upon, or approached. It is\r\nhighly Criminal to pry into their Sports, such an Insolent Curiosity\r\nbeing often punished with Death. The Story is Famous of _Morad_ the\r\nThird, who baiting a Bear in the old Palace with a Mastiff, and espying\r\nthree Fellows upon the Tower of _Bajazid's_ Mosch, who had planted\r\nthemselves to see the Sport, commanded their Heads to be struck off\r\nimmediately, and be brought before him, which was done accordingly.\r\nInstances of such Capricio's are frequent in the _Turkish_ History;\r\nthis following happened during my stay at _Constantinople_.\r\n\r\nUpon the return of Vizir _Achmet_ from _Candia_, after the Surrendry\r\nof that City, and a happy end put by him to that tedious and bloody\r\nWar, he acquainting the present Emperor, then at _Adrianople_,\r\nwith the History of that famous Siege at large, made such terrible\r\nRepresentations of their and the _Venetians_ Mining and Countermining\r\none another, that the Emperor was resolved out of Curiosity to see\r\nthe Experiment made of a thing, that seemed to him almost Incredible.\r\nA Work was soon raised and undermined, and above 30 Murderers and\r\nRobbers upon the High-Way and such like Villains were put into it, as\r\nit were to defend it. The Grand Signior stood upon an Eminence at some\r\nconsiderable distance, expecting the issue of it; upon a Signal given,\r\nthe Mine was sprung, and the Fort demolished, and the poor Wretches\r\ntorn piece-meal to his great Satisfaction and Amazement.\r\n\r\nThe Moon is the auspicious Planet of the _Turks_: According to the\r\ncourse of which they celebrate their Festivals. They begin their Months\r\nfrom the first appearance of it, at which time they choose, except a\r\ndelay brings a great Prejudice and Inconvenience with it, to begin\r\ntheir great Actions. The Crescent is the Ensign of the Empire, which\r\nthey Paint in Banners, and place upon the Spires of their Moschs.\r\nNext to the Day of the appearing Moon, they pitch upon _Friday_, to\r\nfight upon, to begin a journey, and especially their Pilgrimage toward\r\n_Mecca_, or do any thing of great Consequence, as very lucky and\r\nfortunate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  A Relation of a Voyage from _Aleppo_ to _Palmyra_ in _Syria_; sent\r\n    by the Reverend Mr. _William Hallifax_ to Dr. _Edward Bernard_\r\n    (late) _Savilian_ Professor of Astronomy in _Oxford_, and by him\r\n    communicated to Dr. _Thomas Smith.

We departed _Aleppo_ on\r\n_Michaelmas-day_, 1691. and in six easie Days Travel over a Desart\r\nCountry, came to _Tadmor_; Journying almost continually to the South,\r\nwith very little variation to the Eastward. As we rode into the Town,\r\nwe took notice of a Castle about half an Hours distance from it, and\r\nso situated as to Command both the Pass into the Hills, by which we\r\nentred, and the City too. But we could easily perceive it was no Old\r\nBuilding, retaining no Footsteps of the exquisite Workmanship and\r\nIngenuity of the Ancients. Upon Enquiry we were informed, that it\r\nwas built by _Man-Ogle_, a Prince of the _Druces_, in the Reign of\r\n_Amurath_ the Third, _Anno D. N._ 1585. But I know not how to give much\r\nCredit to this Story, because I find not that either _Man-Ogle_, or\r\nany _Drucian_ Prince, was ever Powerful in these Parts, their strength\r\nlying on Mount _Libanus_, and along the Coast of _Sydon_, _Berytus_,\r\n_&c._ 'Tis a Work of more Labour than Art, and the very Situation\r\nalone is enough to render it almost Impregnable; standing on the top\r\nof a very high Hill, enclosed with a deep Ditch, cut out of the very\r\nRock, over which there was only one sole Passage by a Draw-Bridge: This\r\nBridge too is now broken down; so that there is no Entrance remaining,\r\nunless you will be at the Pains to clamber up the Rock, which is in\r\none place feasible, but withal so difficult hazardous, that a small\r\nslip may endanger ones Life. Nor is there any thing within to be seen\r\nsufficient to recompence your Trouble of getting up to it, the Building\r\nbeing confused, and the Rooms very ill contrived. Upon the top of the\r\nHill there is a Well of a prodigious depth, as certainly it must be\r\na great way to come at Water from the top of such a Rock, the Ditch\r\nthat surrounds it, not having the least appearance of moisture therein;\r\nwhich made it therefore seem more strange that a Wild Boar should rush\r\nout thence among our Horses, when we rode up to take a more particular\r\nView of the Place. This Castle stands on the North side of the Town,\r\nand from hence you have the best Prospect of the Country all about.\r\nYou see _Tadmor_ under you inclosed on three sides with long Ridges\r\nof Mountains, which open towards the East gradually to the distance\r\nof about an Hours Riding; but to the South stretches a vast Plain\r\nbeyond the reach of the Eye. In this Plain you see a large Valley of\r\nSalt affording great quantities thereof, and lying near about an Hours\r\ndistance from the City. And this more probably is the Valley of Salt,\r\nmentioned 2 _Sam._ 8. 13. where _David_ smote the _Syrians_, and slew\r\n18000 Men, than another which lies but four Hours from _Aleppo_, and\r\nhas sometimes past for it. The Air is good, but the Soil exceeding\r\nbarren, nothing green to be seen therein, save some few Palm-Trees in\r\nthe Gardens, and here and there about the Town. And from these Trees\r\nI conceive is obtained its Name, both in Hebrew (_Tadmor_) which\r\nsignifies a Palm-Tree, and in Latin (_Palmira_;) and the whole Country\r\nis thence denominated _Syria Palmirena_; and sometimes _Solitudines\r\nPalmirenæ_: So that the Latins did not change but only Translate the\r\nold Name, which therefore still obtains in these Eastern Parts, and\r\nthe more Modern is wholly unknown.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Tadmor._]\r\n\r\nThe City it self appears to have been of a large Extent, by the space\r\nnow taken up by the Ruins; but there are no Footsteps of any Walls\r\nremaining, nor is it possible to judge of the ancient Figure of the\r\nPlace. The present Inhabitants, as they are a Poor, Miserable, dirty\r\nPeople, so they have shut themselves up, to the Number of about Thirty\r\nor Forty Families, in little Huts made of Dirt, within the Walls of\r\na spacious Court, which enclosed a most Magnificent Heathen Temple.\r\nHereinto also we entred, the whole Power of the Village, if I may so\r\ncall it, being gathered together at the Door, whether to stand upon\r\ntheir Defence, in case we proved Enemies, (for some of them had their\r\nGuns in their Hands) or out of meer Curiosity to gaze upon us, I know\r\nnot. However our Guide, who was an _Arab_, whom _Assyne_[14] their\r\npresent King had sent to Conduct us through the whole Voyage, being\r\na Man known among them, we had an easie Admittance, and with a great\r\nmany Welcomes in their Language were led to the _Sheck_'s House, with\r\nwhom we were to make our Abode. And to mention here what the Place\r\nat first View represents. Certainly the World it self cannot afford\r\nthe like mixture of Remains of the greatest State and Magnificence,\r\ntogether with the Extremity of Filth and Poverty. The nearest Parallel\r\nI can think of, is that of the Temple of _Baal_, destroyed by _Jehu_,\r\nand converted into a Draught-House, 2 _Kings_ 10. 27. And if, what is\r\nnot improbable, this very Place was a Temple of _Jupiter Belus_, the\r\nSimilitude will run upon all Four.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Temple.]\r\n\r\nBeing thus lodged within the Place, I shall begin with a Description\r\nthereof, and proceed to what I observed remarkable without. The whole\r\ninclosed Space is a Square of 200 Yard each side, encompass'd with a\r\nhigh and stately Wall, built of large square Stone, and adorned with\r\nPilasters within and without, to the number, (as near as we could\r\ncompute by what is standing of the Wall, which is much the greater\r\npart) of 62 on a side. And had not the Barbarity of the _Turks_,\r\nEnemies to every thing that is splendid and noble, out of a vain\r\nSuperstition, purposely beat down those beautiful Cornishes both\r\nhere and in other Places, we had seen the most curious and exquisite\r\nCarvings in Stone which perhaps the World could ever boast of; as\r\nhere and there a small Remainder, which has escap'd their Fury, does\r\nabundantly evidence. The West side, wherein is the Entrance, is most of\r\nit broken down, and near the middle of the Square, another higher Wall\r\nerected out of the Ruins; which shews to have been a Castle, strong but\r\nrude; the old Stones and many Pillars broken or sawn asunder, being\r\nrolled into the Fabrick, and ill cemented. Within were to be seen the\r\nFoundations of another Wall, which probably might answer this Front,\r\nand that the _Mamalukes_, whose Workmanship it seems most likely to\r\nhave been, built the Castle here for the Security of the Place. Before\r\nthe whole length of this new Front, except a narrow Passage which is\r\nleft for an Entrance, is cut a deep Ditch, the ascent whereof on the\r\ninner side is fac'd with Stone to the very Foot of the Wall, which\r\nmust have render'd it very difficult to have assaulted it. The Passage\r\nto, and the Door it self is very narrow, not wider than to receive a\r\nloaded Camel, or that two Foot-men may well walk abreast. And as soon\r\nas you are within the first Door, you make a short turn to the Right,\r\nand pass on to another of the like bigness, which leads into the Court.\r\nBut all this is but a new Building upon an old, and by this outward\r\nWall is quite shrouded that Magnificent Entrance, which belonged to\r\nthe first Fabrick; of the stateliness whereof we were enabled to judge\r\nby the two Stones which supported the sides of the great Gate, each\r\nof which is 35 Foot in length, and artificially carved with Vines and\r\nclusters of Grapes, exceeding bold and to the Life. They are both\r\nstanding, and in their Places, and the distance between them, which\r\ngives us the wideness of the Gate 15 Foot. But all this is now walled\r\nup to the narrow Door before mentioned. Over the little Door there is\r\nan Inscription in _Greek_, and also another in another Language and\r\nCharacter, which I never saw till in _Tadmor_, nor understand what to\r\nmake of it. From that in _Greek_ we hoped for some Information; but it\r\nwill be evident to any one that reads it, that the Stone was brought\r\nfrom another Place and casually put in there. 'Tis thus:\r\n\r\nΤΟ ΜΝΗΜΕΙΟΝ ΤΟΥ ΤΑΦΕΩΝΟΣ ΕΚΤΙΣΕΝ ΕΞ ΙΔΙΩΝ ΣΕΠΤΙΜΙΟΣ ΟΔΑΙΝΑΘΟΣ Ο\r\nΛΑΜΠΡΟΤΑΤΟΣ ΣΥΝΚΛΗΤ[ΙΚΟΣ] ΑΙΡΑΝΟΥ ΟΥΑΒΑΛΛΑΘΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΝΑΣΩΡΟΥΑΥ ΤΩΤΕ ΚΑΙ\r\nΥΙΟΙΣ ΑΥΤΟΥ ΚΑΙ ΥΙΩΝΟΙΣ ΕΙΣ ΤΟ ΠΑΝΤΕΛΕΣ ΑΙΩΝΙΟΝ ΤΕΙΜΗΝ.\r\n\r\nUnder this was the unknown Characters, which I shall here give you\r\na Specimen of, it being as well as it could be taken, thus. _Vide\r\nFiguram._\r\n\r\nThe Letters between these [] Marks were not Legible, but I have\r\nventured to supply the defect, as also you will see in some others\r\nfollowing. Neither was the Ε in ΜΝΗΜΕΙΟΝ upon the Stone, but was\r\ndoubtless omitted by mistake; and the Inscription is nothing else but\r\nthe Inscription of a Sepulchre, the like to which we saw several, as I\r\nshall have occasion to mention some of them hereafter. And as for the\r\nother Character, it being added almost under every _Greek_ Inscription\r\nwe saw, and rarely found alone, I am apt to believe it the Native\r\nLanguage and Character of the Place, and the Matter it contains nothing\r\nelse but what we have in the _Greek_.\r\n\r\nAs soon as you are entred within the Court, you see the Remainders\r\nof two Rows of very Noble Marble Pillars 37 Foot high, with their\r\nCapitals of most exquisite Carved Work; as also must have been the\r\nCornishes between them, before by Rude and Superstitious Hands they\r\nwere broken down. Of these there are now no more than 58 remaining\r\nentire; but there must have been a great many more, for they appear to\r\nhave gone quite round the whole Court, and to have supported a most\r\nspacious double Piazza or Cloyster. Of this Piazza the Walks on the\r\nWest side, which is opposed to the Front of the Temple, seem to have\r\nexceeded the other in Beauty and Spaciousness; and at each end thereof\r\nare two Niches for Statues at their full length, with their Pedestals,\r\nBorders, Supporters, and Canopies, carved with the greatest Artifice\r\nand Curiosity. The Space within this once Beautiful Enclosure, which\r\nis now filled with nothing but the dirty Huts of the Inhabitants, I\r\nconceive to have been an open Court, in the midst whereof stands the\r\nTemple, encompass'd with another row of Pillars of a different Order,\r\nand much higher than the former, being above 50 Foot high. Of these\r\nremain now but 16, but there must have been about double that Number,\r\nwhich whether they enclosed an inner Court, or supported the Roof of a\r\nCloyster, there being nothing now of a Roof remaining, is uncertain.\r\nOnly one great Stone lies down, which seems to have reach'd from these\r\nPillars to the Walls of the Temple. The whole Space contained within\r\nthese Pillars we found to be 59 Yards in Length, and in Breadth near\r\n28. In the midst of which Space is the Temple, extending in Length\r\nmore than 33 Yards, and in Breadth 13 or 14. It points North and South,\r\nhaving a most Magnificent Entrance on the West, exactly in the middle\r\nof the Building, which by the small Remains yet to be seen, seems to\r\nhave been one of the most glorious Structures in the World. I never\r\nsaw Vines and clusters of Grapes cut in Stone, so Bold, so Lively, and\r\nso Natural, in any Place: And we had doubtless seen things abundantly\r\nmore curious, if they had not been maliciously broken to pieces. Just\r\nover the Door we could make a shift to discern part of the Wings of a\r\nlarge Spread-Eagle, extending the whole wideness thereof. The largeness\r\nwhereof led me at first to imagine it might have been rather a Cherub\r\nover-shadowing the Entrance, there being nothing of the Body remaining\r\nto guide ones Judgment, and some little Angels or _Cupids_ appear still\r\nin the corners of the same Stone. But afterwards seeing other Eagles\r\nupon Stones that were fallen down, I conclude this must have been one\r\nlikewise, only of a much larger size. Of this Temple there is nothing\r\nat present but the outward Walls standing, in which it is observable,\r\nthat as the Windows were not large, so they were made narrower towards\r\nthe top, than they were below; but all adorned with excellent Carvings.\r\nWithin the Walls, the _Turks_, or more probably the _Mamalukes_, have\r\nbuilt a Roof, which is supported by small Pillars and Arches; but a\r\ngreat deal lower, as well as in all other respects disproportionate\r\nand inferior to what the Ancient Covering must have been. And they\r\nhave converted the place into a Mosque, having added to the South End\r\nthereof new Ornaments after their manner, with _Arabick_ Inscriptions\r\nand Sentences out of the _Alcoran_, wrote in Flourishes and Wreaths,\r\nnot without Art. But at the North End of the Building, which is shut\r\nout of the Mosque, are Relicks of much greater Artifice and Beauty.\r\nWhether they were in the Nature of Canopies over some Altars placed\r\nthere, or to what other use they served, I am not able to conjecture.\r\nThey are beautified with the most curious Fretwork and Carvings; in the\r\nmidst of which is a Dome or Cupola, above six Foot Diameter, which we\r\nfound above to be of one piece; whether hewn out of a Rock entire, or\r\nmade of some Artificial Cement or Composition, by Time hardened into\r\na Lapideous Substance, seems doubtful; though I am rather inclined\r\nto believe the latter. It is in fine, a most exquisite Piece of\r\nWorkmanship, and on which I could have bestowed more time to view it,\r\nthan what was allowed us, hastening to other Sights.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A Mosch._]\r\n\r\nHaving taken this Survey of the Temple, we went Abroad, where our Eyes\r\nwere presently accosted with an amazing sight of a multitude of Marble\r\nPillars, standing scattered up and down, for the space of near a Mile\r\nof Ground, this way and that, but so disposed as to afford no solid\r\nFoundation to judge, what sort of Structures they formerly framed. I\r\npass by the Ruins of a Mosch, which directing our Course Northward, was\r\nthe first thing occurr'd to our View, after we came out of the Court\r\nof the Temple, which though of a more Artificial Frame and Composure\r\nthan many I have seen, yet is not worthy to stop us in the way to\r\nthings both of greater Antiquity, and every way more noble and worthy\r\nour Consideration. Having therefore past this, you have the Prospect\r\nof such Magnificent Ruins, that if it be lawful to frame a Conjecture\r\nof the Original Beauty of the Place, by what is still remaining, I\r\nquestion somewhat whether any City in the World could have challenged\r\nPrecedence of this in its Glory. But it being impossible as they now\r\nstand to reduce them to any regular Method, I must be forced to give\r\nyou a rude Account of them as they came in sight; and which will fall\r\nmuch short of the Greatness and Stateliness which they shew to the Eye.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: An Obelisk.]\r\n\r\nAdvancing then towards the North, you have before you a very tall and\r\nstately Obelisk or Pillar, consisting of seven large Stones, besides\r\nits Capital and a wreath'd Work above it; the Carvings here, as in\r\nall other Places, being extraordinary fine. The height of it is above\r\n50 Foot, and upon it I conceive may have stood a Statue, which the\r\n_Turks_, zealous Enemies of all Imagery, have thrown down, and broken\r\nin pieces. 'Tis in compass, just above the Pedestal, 12 Foot and a\r\nhalf. On each Hand of this, towards the East and West, you see two\r\nother large Pillars, each a quarter of a Mile distant from you, which\r\nseem to have some Correspondence one to the other. And there is a\r\npiece of another standing near that of the East, which would incline\r\none to think there was once a continued row of them. The height of this\r\nto the East I took with my Quadrant, and conclude to be more than 42\r\nFoot high, and the Circumference proportionable. Upon the Body thereof\r\nis the following Inscription.\r\n\r\nΗ ΒΟΥΛΗ ΚΑΙ Ο ΔΗΜΟΣ ΛΛΙΛΑΜΕΝΑ ΠΑΝΟΥ ΜΟΚΙΜΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΑΙΡΑΝΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΜΑΘΘΑ ΚΑΙ\r\nΑΙΡΑΝΗΝ ΤΟΝ ΠΑΤΕΡΑ ΑΥΤΟΥ ΕΥΣΕΒΕΙΣ ΚΑΙ ΦΙΛΟΠΑΤΡΙΔΑΣ Κ(ΑΙ) ΠΑΝΤΙ ΤΡΟΠΩ\r\n(ΕΥ)ΣΕΙΜΩΣ ΑΡΕΣΑΝΤΑΣ ΤΗ ΠΑΤΡΙΔΙ ΚΑΙ ΠΑΤΡΙΟΙΣ ΘΕΟΙΣ ΤΕΙΜΗΣ ΧΑΡΙΝ ΕΤΟΥΣ Ν\r\nΥ Λ ΜΗΝΟΣ ΞΑΝΔΙΚΟΥ.\r\n\r\nI perswade my self it would be but lost Labour to spend time in making\r\nReflections upon this or the following Inscriptions; as for the\r\nKnowledge they may exhibit to the World, your own Conjectures will more\r\nhappily lead you unto it, than any thing I am like to suggest. It seems\r\nhowever pretty evident they were a Free State, governed by a Senate\r\nand People, though perhaps under the Protection of great Empires, the\r\n_Parthians_, it is probable, first, and afterward the _Romans_, who\r\nfor a long time contended for the Mastery here in the East. And this\r\nGovernment might continue among them till about the time of _Aurelian_,\r\nwho demolished the Place, and led _Zenobia_, Wife of _Odenatus_,\r\nCaptive to _Rome_: Who, though she be called Queen, yet I find not\r\nthat ever her Husband had the Title of King; but was only one of the\r\nChief Inhabitants, a Leading Man in the Senate (as 'tis probable this\r\n_Alilamanes_ and _Airanes_ were before him) who while the _Romans_\r\nwere busied in _Europe_, made himself great here, and by his own Force\r\nrepelled the _Parthians_; who having Master'd whatever was held by\r\nthe _Romans_ on the other side of _Euphrates_, made an Incursion into\r\n_Syria_, but were by _Odenatus_ driven back beyond the River. In the\r\ncourse of these Wars _Odenatus_ was slain, but his Wife _Zenobia_,\r\nbeing a Woman of a Masculine Spirit, not only kept her Ground against\r\nher Enemies Abroad, but maintained her Authority at Home, keeping the\r\nGovernment in her Hands. Afterwards out of a desire to cast off the\r\n_Roman_ Yoke, she caused the whole Garrison, which was left there by\r\n_Aurelian_, to be barbarously cut off: Which bringing _Aurelian_ back\r\nwith his Army, he quickly took the City, and destroyed it, putting the\r\nInhabitants to the Sword, and carrying _Zenobia_ Captive to _Rome_;\r\nwhich was the Fatal Period of the Glory of the Place. This Custom of\r\ntheirs of running up their Genealogies or Pedigrees to the fourth or\r\nfifth Generation, shews them to have borrowed some of their Fashions\r\nfrom their Neighbours the _Jews_, with whom it is not unlikely they had\r\nof old great Commerce; and perhaps many of them were descended from\r\nthat People, _Zenobia_ her self being said to have been a _Jewess_; Or\r\nelse this must have been the manner of all the Eastern Nations. Their\r\n_Æra_ or Account of Time they begin from the Death of _Alexander_ the\r\nGreat, as the _Syrians_ generally do; the very Christians at this Day\r\nfollowing the same usage. Yet though they mark the Date of the Year by\r\n_Greek_ Letters, you may observe they place them a different way from\r\nthe _Greeks_, setting the lesser Number first, as if they were to be\r\nread backward, from the right Hand to the left; as Ν Υ here, denoting\r\n450. The third Letter Λ, I take to stand for the Day of the Month,\r\n_viz._ the last of _Xandicus_, which is with us _April_; this and other\r\nnames of Months, which are found in other Inscriptions, being borrowed\r\nfrom the _Macedonians_ with very little variation. That they were\r\nIdolaters, is plain by the mention of their Country Gods, both here\r\nand in other Places: So that their Commerce with the _Jews_, did not,\r\nit seems, bring them to the Knowledge of the true God, or else they\r\nmust have degenerated therefrom, and relapsed into Idolatry. The other\r\nPillar towards the West in Height and Circumference answers this, and\r\nhas upon the side the following Inscription engraved.\r\n\r\nΗ ΒΟΥΛΗ ΚΑΙ Ο ΔΗΜΟΣ ΒΑΡΕΙΧΕΙΝ ΑΜΡΙΣΑΜΣΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΙΑΡΙΒΩΛΕΟΥΣ ΚΑΙ ΜΟΚΙΜΟΝ\r\nΥΙΟΝ ΑΥΤΟΥ ΕΥΣΕΒΕΙΣ ΚΑΙ ΦΙΛΟΠΑΤΡΙΔΑΣ ΤΕΙΜΗΣ ΧΑΡΙΝ.\r\n\r\nThe Date of this is not legible, neither does one know what Judgment to\r\nmake of the thing it self. That such a Pillar should be erected only to\r\nsupport the Inscription, and convey these Mens Names to After-Ages,\r\nwithout particularizing what they did to deserve that Honour, is\r\nsomething strange: unless we may suppose it was a prevailing Vanity in\r\nthese Eastern Countries thus to endeavour to Eternize their Fame. An\r\nInstance whereof we have in Scripture, in _Absalom_'s setting him up a\r\nPillar, 2 _Kings_ 18. 18. and perhaps before him, in _Saul_, 1 _Sam._\r\n15. 12. Otherwise it may appear no improbable Conjecture, that the\r\nPillar was erected long before upon some other Occasion, and afterwards\r\nmade use of to this end: And I look upon it as past all doubt that\r\nseveral other Inscriptions which we saw, were much more Modern than the\r\nPillars, on which they were engraved.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Piazza.]\r\n\r\nProceeding forward, directly from the Obelisk, about 100 Paces, you\r\ncome to a Magnificent Entrance, vastly large and lofty, and for the\r\nexquisiteness of the Workmanship not inferior to any thing before\r\ndescribed. I wish I could add, that it had not suffered the same Fate\r\nas the rest, and then we might have seen a rare Piece of the Ancient\r\nBeauty of the Place. This Entrance leads you into a Noble Piazza of\r\nmore than half a Mile long, 938 Yards according to our Measuring, and\r\n40 Foot in breadth, enclosed with two rows of stately Marble Pillars,\r\n26 Foot high, and 8 or 9 about. Of these remain standing and entire\r\n129, but by a moderate Calculate there could not have been less at\r\nfirst than 560. Covering there is none remaining, nor any Pavement at\r\nthe bottom, unless it be buried under the Rubbish. But upon almost all\r\nthe Pillars we found Inscriptions, both in _Greek_ and the Language\r\nunknown, of which we had time to take but very few, and those not very\r\nInstructive. But such as they are I'll present you them here, without\r\nobserving any other Order, but as they happened to be transcribed.\r\n\r\nΙΟΥΛΙΟΝ ΑΥΡΗΛΙΟΝ ΖΕΒΕΙΔΑΝ ΜΟΚΙΜΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΖΕΒΕΙΔΟΥ .......: ΑΣΘΩΡΟΒΑΙΔΑΟΙ\r\nΣΥΝ Α(Υ)ΤΩ ΚΑΤΕΛΘΟΝΤΕΣ ΕΙΣ ΟΛΟΓΕΣΙΑΔΑ ΕΝΠΟΡΟΙΑΝ ΕΣΤΗΣΑΝ ΑΡΕΣΑΝΤΑ ΑΥΤΟΙΣ\r\nΤΕΙΜΗΣ ΧΑΡΙΝ ΞΑΝΔΙΚΩ ΤΟΥ ΗΝΦ ΕΤΟΥΣ....\r\n\r\nI give you, Sir, these Inscriptions, as those before, just as I found\r\nthem, without any Amendments, so much as of litteral Faults, only\r\nwhere a Letter, or piece of a Word was not legible, if I could make a\r\nprobable Conjecture what it should be, I have ventured to add it. The\r\nlast seems to have been put up in Memory of an Embassy, performed by\r\nthose Men that are named therein, for settling a Commerce and Traffick,\r\nwhich was to their Satisfaction accomplish'd: But with whom, till I can\r\nfind out what Place is meant by[15]ΟΛΟΓΕΣΙΑΔΑ, I must remain Ignorant.\r\nI am unwilling to entertain any Thoughts of _Getia_ in _Macedonia_,\r\nor of _Olgassus_, a Place mentioned by _Strabo_ in _Bythinia_, which\r\ncomes a little nearer the Name, being both so remote, and the City of\r\n_Tadmor_ ill contrived for a Place of Trade, being far from the Sea,\r\nand without the Advantage of any River. Yet the Magnificence of the\r\nPlace shews they have not wanted Riches among them: And their Salt is\r\na Commodity which still brings them in a considerable Advantage. The\r\nOrder of the Numeral Letters you may take notice is again inverted; but\r\ntaking them the right way, the Year 558 falls in with the last Year of\r\nthe Reign of _Alexander Severus_, which is of our Lord 234.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the Piazza, upon another Pillar, was this following\r\nInscription.\r\n\r\nΗ ΒΟΥΛΗ ΚΑΙ Ο ΔΗΜΟΣ ΙΟΥΛΙΟΝ ΑΥΡΗΛΙΟΝ ΖΗΝΟΒΙΟΝ ΤΟΝ ΚΑΙ ΖΑΒΔΙΛΑΝ\r\nΔΙΣΜΑΛΧΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΝΑΣΣΟΥΜΟΥ ΣΤΡΑΤΗΓΗΣΑΝΤΑ ΕΝ ΕΠΙΔΗΜΙΑ ΘΕΟΥ ΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΥ ΚΑΙ\r\nΥΠΗΡΕΤΗΣΑΝΤΑ ΠΑΡΟΥΣΙΑ ΔΙΗΝΕΚΕΙ ΡΟΥΤΙΛΛΙΟΥ ΚΡΙΣΠΕΙΝΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΗΓΗΣΑΜΕΝΟΥ ΚΑΙ\r\nΕΠΙΔΗΜΗΣΑΣΑΙΣ ΟΥΗΞΙΛΛΑΤΙΟΣΙΝ ΑΓΟΡΑΝΟΜΗΣΑΝΤΑΤΕ ΚΑΙ ΟΥΚΟΝΙΣΩΝΑ ΦΕΙΔΗΣΑΝΤΑ\r\nΧΡΗΜΑΤΩΝ ΚΑΙ ΚΑΛΩΣ ΠΟΛΕΙΤΕΥΣΑΜΕΝΟΝ ΩΣ ΔΙΑ ΤΑΥΤΑ ΜΑΡΤΥΡΗΘΕΝΤΑ ΥΠΟ ΘΕΟΥ\r\nΙΑΡΙΒΩΛΟΥ ΚΑΙ ΥΠΟ ΙΟΥΛΙΟΥ .......

What I further observed particularly in this, was the want\r\nof the Name after ΙΟΥΛΙΟΥ, and took notice of the like space vacant in\r\nthe other Language under it; and in both places it seemed to be not\r\nworn out with Time, but voluntarily scratch'd out. Which confirms me\r\nin the Opinion that they are both one, and that the unknown was the\r\nVulgar, as the _Greek_ was the learned Language of the Place. Upon\r\nanother Pillar in the same Walk was this.\r\n\r\nΣΕΠΤΙΜΙΟΝ ΟΥΟΡΩΔΗΝ ΤΟΝ ΚΡΑΤΙΣΤΟΝ ΕΠΙΤΡΟΠΟΝ ΣΕΒΑΣΤΟΥ ΔΟΥΚΗΝΑΡΙΟΝ ΚΑΙ\r\nΑΡΟΑΠΕΤΗΝ ΙΟΥΛΙΟΣ ΑΥΡΗΛΙΟΣ ΕΑΛΜΗΣ ΚΑΣΣΙΑΝΟΥ ΤΟΥ Μ(Ε)ΛΕΝΑΙΟΥ ΙΠΠΕΥΣ\r\nΡΩΜΑΙΩΝ ΤΟΝ ΦΙΛΟΝ ΚΑΙ ΠΡΟΣΤΑΤΗΝ ΕΤΟΥΣ Η Ο Φ ... ΜΗΝΕΙ (Ξ)ΑΝΔΙΚΩ.\r\n\r\nFrom another Pillar in the same Piazza was Transcribed this broken\r\nInscription which follows, which I have endeavoured to make up from the\r\nformer, believing them in substance the very same, with some little\r\nAlteration of Names.\r\n\r\nΣΕΠΤΙΜ(ΙΟΝ ΟΥΟΡΩΔΗΝ) ΤΟΝ ΚΡΑ(ΤΙΣΤΟΝ ΕΠΙΤΡΟ)ΠΟΝ ΣΕΒΑΣ(ΤΟΥ ΔΟΥΚ)ΗΝΑΡΙΟΝ\r\nΚΑ[Ι ΑΡΟΑΠΕ]ΤΗΝ ΙΟΥΛΙΟΣ ΑΥ[ΡΗΛΙ]ΟΣ Ε[ΑΛΜΗΣ] ΠΥΙΛΣΟΣ Μ[ΕΛΕΝΑΙ]ΟΣ ΜΑΛΩΧΑ\r\nΝΑΣΣΟΥΜΟ[Υ] Ο ΚΡΑΤΙΣΤΟΣ ΤΟΝ [ΦΙΛΟΝ] ΚΑΙ ΠΡΟΣΤΑΤΗΝ ΤΕΙΜΗΣ ΕΝΕΚΕΝ\r\nΕΤΟΥΣ ... [ΜΗΝΕΙ Ξ]ΑΝΔΙΚΩ.\r\n\r\nThis is so like the preceeding, that I thought I might fairly take the\r\nLiberty to make these Additions to it. And what we may Collect from\r\nboth, and divers others of a like Import, is, That as the State, the\r\nSenate, and People, did sometimes Honour those that had been in Publick\r\nTrust, with Inscriptions upon these Pillars: So when this was not done\r\nby them, private Persons had the Liberty to do the same for their\r\nFriends. And I shall give you an Instance by and by of one Engraven\r\nby a Husband in Memory of his Wife. Upon several of these Pillars are\r\nlittle Pedestals jetting out about the middle of them, sometimes one\r\nway only, and sometimes more, which seem to have been the Bases or\r\nstanding Places of Statues. But none of these are remaining; neither\r\nis it to be expected they should, in a place which has been so long in\r\nthe Hands of the _Turks_. On these Pedestals we saw many Inscriptions,\r\nsometimes when there were none upon the Body of the Pillar, and\r\nsometimes when there were. As for Instance this that follows upon the\r\nPedestal, thus.\r\n\r\nΣΕΠΤΙΜΙΟΝ ΑΙΡΑΝΗΝ ΟΔΑΙΝΟΘΟΥ ΤΟΝ ΛΑΜΠΡΟΤΑΤΟΝ ΣΥΝΚΛΗΤΙΚΟΝ. And upon the\r\nBody of the Pillar this Imperfect one; which I dare not venture to fill\r\nup, but shall give it you as we found it.\r\n\r\nΕΞΑ......ΝΤΩΝ ΑΥΡΗΛΙ.....Ρ ΗΛΙΟΔΩΡ..... ΣΤΡΑΤΙΩΤΗΣ ΛΕ.......ΚΗΣ ΤΩΝ\r\nΠΑΤΡΩΝ ΤΕΙΜΗΣ ΚΑΙ ΕΥΧΑΡΙΣΤΙΑΣ ΧΑΡΙΝ ΕΤΟΥΣ ΓΞΦ.\r\n\r\nWe see they esteemed it very Honourable to have their Memories\r\npreserved after this manner; but it is but little Knowledge of them\r\nwe can get from hence, save now and then the Time when they lived. As\r\nhere, 563 Years after the Death of _Alexander_ reach to the Year of our\r\nLord 239. Another Inscription in the same Piazza was thus.\r\n\r\nΗ ΒΟΥΛ[Η ΚΑΙ Ο ΔΗ]ΜΟΣ ΣΕΠΤΙΜΙΟΝ ΤΟΝ ΚΡΑΤΙΣΤΟΝ Ε[ΠΙΤΡΟΠΟΝ Σ]ΕΒΑΣΤΟΥ\r\nΔΟΥΚΗΝ[ΑΡΙΟΝ] ....ΕΟΔΟΤΗΝ ΤΗΣ ΜΗΤ[ΡΟΚΟΛΩ]ΝΕΙΑΣ ΚΑΙ ΑΝΑΚΟΜΙΣΑ(ΝΤΑ Τ)ΑΣ\r\nΣΥΝΟΔΙΑΣ ΕΞ ΙΔΙΩΝ ΚΑΙ ΜΑΡΤΥΡΗΘΕΝΤΑ ΥΠΟ ΤΩΝ ΑΡΧΕΜΠΟΡΩΝ ΚΑΙ ΛΑΜΠΡΩΣ\r\nΣΤΡΑΤΗΓΗΣΑΝΤΑ ΚΑΙ ΑΓΟΡΑΝΟΜΗΣΑΝΤΑ ΤΗΣ ΑΥΤΗΣ ΜΗΤΡΟΚΟΛΩΝΕΙΑΣ ΚΑΙ ΠΛΕΙΣΤΑ\r\nΟΙΚΟΘΕΝ ΑΝΑΛΩΣΑΝΤΑ ΚΑΙ ΑΡΕΣΑΝΤΑ ΤΗ ΤΕ ΑΥΤΗ ΒΟΥΛΗ ΚΑΙ ΤΩ ΔΗΜΩ ΚΑΙ ΝΥΝΕΙ\r\nΛΑΜΠΡΩΣ ΣΥΜΠΟΣΙΑΡΧΟΝ ΤΩΝ ΤΟΥ ΔΙΟΣ ΒΗΛΟΥ ΙΕ[Ρ]ΩΝ ΤΕΙΜΗΣ ΕΝΕΚΕΝ ΕΤ.....\r\nΞΑΝΔΙΚΩ.\r\n\r\nThis affords a sufficient confirmation of what I before observed, that\r\nthese were Honorary Inscriptions in Memory of those that had behaved\r\nthemselves well in Publick Offices; of which we have several mentioned\r\nhere, whereof some are very well known, but the others not easie to\r\nbe met with in Books. By the Word ΜΗΤΡΟΚΟΛΩΝΕΙΑΣ, we may be assured\r\nthat though the City was reduced by the _Romans_ into the form of a\r\nColony, yet it had a peculiar mark of Honour set upon it, to signifie\r\nthat it was the chief of their Colonies in these Oriental Parts. That\r\nthe Authority also of their Senate and People was continued to them.\r\nAnd besides that there was a Society of Men, either Curators of the\r\nTemple of _Jupiter Belus_ (to whom the Temple before described perhaps\r\nwas dedicated,) or Overseers of the Sports and Festivals that were\r\ncelebrated in Honour of him; of which Sodality this _Septimius_ was,\r\nwhen this Inscription was made, a _Symposiarch_, perhaps their Chief\r\nand Governour. By this too we find they did not wait for the Deaths of\r\nthose they thus honoured, before they provided for the Preservation of\r\ntheir Memories; but Famous Men were thus Registered for After-Ages even\r\nwhile they were alive. Upon one of these Pedestals before described,\r\nnot far from the former, was the following Inscription; which I valued\r\nthe more for the little remainder it has preserved of the Name of\r\n_Palmyra_, by which the Place was known to the _Romans_.\r\n\r\n...ΥΠΙΛΙΟΝ ΟΥΟΡΩΔΗΝ [ΣΥΝΚΛ]ΗΤΙΚΟΝ ΚΑΙ ΒΟΥΛΕΥΤΗΝ ΠΑΛΜΥΡΗΝΟΝ ΒΗΛΑ\r\nΚΑΒΟΣΑΡΣΑ ΤΟΝ ΦΙ[ΛΟΝ] ΤΕΙΜΗΣ ΧΑΡΙΝ ΕΤΟΥΣ Ο Φ.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Banquetting-House.]\r\n\r\nThe upper end of this spacious Piazza was shut in by a row of Pillars,\r\nstanding somewhat closer than those on each side; and perhaps there\r\nmight have been a kind of Banquetting-House above, but now no certain\r\nFootsteps thereof remain. But a little farther to the left Hand, and,\r\nit may be, continued with the former Walk, lie the Ruins of a very\r\nstately Building, which I am apt to believe might have been for such\r\nan use. 'Tis built of better Marble, and has an Air of Delicacy and\r\nExquisiteness in the Work, beyond what is discernable in the Piazza.\r\nThe Pillars which supported it are of one entire Stone; and on one of\r\nthem that is fallen down, but so firm and strong that it has received\r\nno Injury thereby, we measured, and found 22 Foot in length, and in\r\ncompass 8 Foot and 9 Inches. Among these Ruins we found the only\r\n_Latin_ Inscription we saw in the Place, and that so imperfect, there\r\nis but little of it Intelligible.\r\n\r\n_......es Orbis & Propagatores Generis Humani D. D. N. N.\r\n_Diocletianus_ ............ssimi Impp. Et _Constantius_ & _Maximianus_\r\nNobb. Cæs. Castra feliciter condiderunt._\r\n\r\nAnd upon the same Stone a little lower,\r\n\r\n_........ntes _Ossiano Hieroclete_, V. P. Præs. Provinciæ D. N. M. O.\r\nEorum._ The Name of _Maximianus Hercules_, who was Partner in the\r\nEmpire with _Dioclesian_ which should have followed in the Inscription,\r\nseems to have been on purpose scratch'd out, and defaced, for what\r\nreason I cannot guess. The rest is lost by the breaking of the Stone.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Palace.]\r\n\r\nIn the West side of the great Piazza are several openings for Gates\r\nleading into the Court of the Palace: Two whereof, one would easily\r\nbelieve when they were in their Perfection, were the most Magnificent\r\nand Glorious in the World, both for the Elegancy of the Work in\r\ngeneral, and particularly for those stately Porphyry Pillars with which\r\nthey were adorned. Each Gate had four, not standing in a Line with the\r\nothers of the Wall, but placed by couples in the Front of the Gate,\r\nfacing the Palace, two on one Hand, and two on the other. Of these\r\nremain two entire, and but one standing in its place. They are about\r\n30 Foot in length, and 9 in circumference; of a Substance so exceeding\r\nhard, that it was with great difficulty we broke off a few shivers to\r\nbring home with us for a pattern of the Stone, the Art of making which,\r\nI think is quite lost. We saw several other broken pieces of Porphyry,\r\nbut neither of so accurate a Mixture and Composition, nor so large as\r\nthe former. The hard Fate of one I could not but lament, when I saw it\r\ndebased to support the corner of a little Hut, scarce good enough for a\r\nDog-Kennel, or a Hogsty. The Palace it self is so entirely ruined, that\r\nno Judgment can be made what it was in its Ancient Splendor, either\r\nfor the Figure or Workmanship thereof. There is only here and there\r\na broken piece of a Wall remaining, beat into pieces by Violence, and\r\nconsumed by Time to that degree, that without the help of Tradition we\r\ncould hardly be well assured, that a Royal Palace did once fill that\r\nSpace. We may guess however that it fronted the Famous Piazza before\r\nmentioned, and was surrounded with rows of Pillars of different Orders,\r\nmany of which are still standing, some plain, and some wrought and\r\nchannell'd, as those immediately encompassing the Temple. And upon\r\nthose little Pedestals which stood out of the middle of some of them,\r\nI observed several Inscriptions, but could not conveniently take more\r\nthan one, which together with the Pillar that supported it was fallen\r\nto the Ground. 'Twas this.\r\n\r\nΜΑΡΘΕΙΝ ΑΛΕΞΑΝΔΡΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΚΑΠΑΔΗΤΟΥ ΟΥΑΒΑΛΛΑΘΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΣΥΜΩΝΟΥ ΣΟΡΑΙΧΟΣ\r\nΑΙΡΑΝΟΥ ΑΝΗΡ ΑΥΤΗΣ ΜΝΗΜΗΣ ΕΝΕΚΕΝ ΜΗΝΕΙ ΔΥΣΤΡΩ ΤΟΥ Ϟ Υ ΕΤΟΥΣ.\r\n\r\nIf the rest were of a like Nature with this, we have lost no great\r\nmatter by not taking them, this being only a Memorial, which a kind\r\nHusband caused to be set up in Honour of his Wife. The Month _Dystrus_,\r\nanswers our _March_, and the Year 490 from the Death of _Alexander_ the\r\nGreat, the Year of our Lord 166.\r\n\r\nI omitted to mention before, that under the long Walk runs a Current\r\nof hot Sulphureous Waters; and there is a Well and other Passages\r\ndown to them. But whatever they may have been of old, they are not\r\nnow so convenient as another about half a Mile Westward from hence;\r\nwhere there is a very good Descent into the Water, and it is still\r\nused by the People to Bath in. Near to which, upon the Pedestal of a\r\nbroken Pillar, (or perhaps it might be an Altar) remains this following\r\nInscription.\r\n\r\nΔΙΙ ΥΨΙΣΤΩ ΜΕΓΙΣΤΩ ΚΑΙ ΕΠΗΚΟΩ ΒΩΛΑΝΟΣ ΖΗΝΟΒΙΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΑΙΡΑΝΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΜΟΚΙΜΟΥ\r\nΤΟΥ ΜΑΘΘΑ ΕΠΙ ΜΕΛΕΤΗ ΣΟΗ ΑΙΡΕΘΕΙΣ _ΕΦΚΑΣ_ ΠΗΓΗΣ ΥΠΟ ΙΑΡΙΒΩΛΟΥ ΘΕΟΥ ΤΟΝ\r\nΒΩ [forsan ΒΩΜΟΝ] ΕΞ ΙΔΙΩΝ ΑΝΕΘΗΚΕΝ ΕΤΟΥΣ Δ Ο Υ ΜΗΝΟΣ YΠΕΡΒΕΡΕΤΑΙΟΥ Κ.\r\n\r\nI am pretty confident that the Word I have mark'd with a Line under\r\nit, is rightly taken, and therefore know not what to guess it to be,\r\nunless the proper Name of the Fountain. And upon that Supposition the\r\nInscription is easily Intelligible, shewing that _Bolanus_, Son of\r\n_Zenobius_, &c. being elected Overseer or Curator of this Fountain,\r\nunder _Jaribolus_, built this Altar to _Jupiter_, in the Year of\r\n_Alexander_ 474. _i. e._ of our Lord 150. and on the 20_th_ of\r\n_October_, if the last _Kappa_ be a Numeral, as I suppose it must. But\r\nwho this _Jaribolus_ was, on whom they bestow, as generally upon the\r\n_Roman_ Emperors, whose Names occur in the Inscriptions, the Title of\r\nΘΕΟΣ, is not so facile a Conjecture. They were under the _Parthians_,\r\nbefore the _Romans_ fell in amongst them; but the Date shews this to\r\nbe after the time of _Hadrian_, and so after their coming. Nay, and in\r\nan Inscription before mentioned, which is of a later Date than this by\r\n88 Years, we have the Name of the same Person. Hot Sulphureous Baths\r\nare things very frequent in this Country; and thence it was that it\r\nobtained the Name of _Syria Salutifera_. The scent of the Waters here\r\nis much like those of _Bath_ in _England_, but not so strong, neither\r\nis the Taste so offensive. On the contrary, when they have run so far\r\nfrom the Fountain, as to become cold, they are very potable, and are\r\nthe only Waters the Inhabitants use. But we, during our stay there,\r\nsent to a Fountain of very excellent Water, about an hour distant from\r\nthe City.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The little Temple.]\r\n\r\nOn the East side likewise of the long Piazza stands, if I may use such\r\nan Expression, a Wood of Marble Pillars, some perfect, and others\r\ndeprived of their beautiful Capitals; but so scattered and confused,\r\nthat it is not possible to reduce them into any Order, so as to\r\nconjecture to what they anciently served. In one place are Eleven\r\ntogether in Square after this manner\r\n\r\n  . . . .\r\n  .     .\r\n  .     .\r\n  . .   .\r\n\r\npaved at the bottom with broad flat Stone, but without any Roof or\r\nCovering. And at a little distance from that stands the Ruins of\r\na small Temple, which by the remains seems to have been for the\r\nWorkmanship very curious: But the Roof is wholly gone, and the Walls\r\nvery much defaced and consumed with Time. Before the Entrance which\r\nlooks to the South, is a Piazza supported by six Pillars, two on one\r\nHand of the Door, and two on the other, and at each end one. And the\r\nPedestals of those in the Front have been filled with Inscriptions,\r\nboth in _Greek_ and the other Language; but they are now so obliterated\r\nand worn out, as not to be Intelligible. The most perfect was this that\r\nfollows.\r\n\r\nΜΑΛΕΝΤΟΝ ΚΑΙ ΑΓΡΙΠΠΑΝ ΙΑΡΑΙΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΡΑΑΙΟΥ ΓΡΑΜΜΑΤΕΑ ΓΕΝΟΜΕΝΟΝ ΤΟ\r\nΔΕΥΤΕΡΟΝ ΕΠΙΔΗΜΙ[Α] ΘΕΟΥ ΑΔΡΙΑΝΟΥ ΑΛΙΜΜΑ ΠΑΡΑΣΧΟΤΑ ΞΕΝΟΙΣ ΤΕ, ΚΑΙ\r\nΠΟΛΕΙΤΑ[ΙΣ]...... And a little below were these straggling Letters\r\nvisible.\r\n\r\nΕΝΗ....Ν ΥΠΗΡΕΤΗΣΑΝΤΑ ΤΗΤ.... ΣΤΡΑΤΕΥΜΑ ΤΟΥ ... ΥΠΟ....ΗΚΑΙ.....ΤΟΝ\r\nΝΑΟΝ ΤΟΝ....ΔΙΟΣ....ΝΤΩΤ......\r\n\r\nI should have imagined the ΚΑΙ to have been a Copulative, and\r\nthe second Name _Agrippa_ distinct from the former, but that the\r\nWords following in the Singular Number, will not admit of such a\r\nConstruction. The Person then in Memory of whom this Inscription was\r\nmade, must have been named _Malentus Cæagrippa_, who bearing such\r\nan Office as Scribe, or the like, in the Expedition of _Adrian_ the\r\nEmperor, performed an Act of Publick Benificence and Generosity, both\r\nto Strangers and Citizens, denoted by the Word[16] ΑΛΙΜΜΑ, or ἄλειμμα,\r\nwhich signifies Unction. Perhaps he distributed amongst them Sweet\r\nOyls, to be used in or after their Bathings. 'Tis pity what follows is\r\nso imperfect; and especially that we cannot find out the Date: For that\r\nmight have directed us to the precise time of _Hadrian_'s Expedition\r\ninto these Oriental Parts, where he made great Conquests, and enlarged\r\nthe Bounds of the _Roman_ Empire.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The Sepulchers.]\r\n\r\nBut as great a Curiosity as any were their Sepulchers, being Square\r\nTowers, four or five Stories high, and standing on both sides of a\r\nhollow way, towards the North part of the City. They stretch out in\r\nlength the space of a Mile, and perhaps formerly might extend a great\r\nway further. At our first view of them, as we entred the place, we\r\ncould not conjecture what they were; some thought them the Steeples\r\nof ruined Churches, and were in hopes we should have found some\r\nfootsteps of Christianity here. Others took them to have been Bastions,\r\nand part of the Old Fortifications, tho' there is not so much as any\r\nFoundation of a Wall to be seen. But when we came a Day or two after,\r\nmore curiously to enquire into them, we quickly found their use. They\r\nwere all of the same Form, but of different Splendor and Greatness,\r\naccording to the Circumstances of their Founders. The first we viewed\r\nwas entirely Marble; but is now wholly in Ruins, and nothing but a heap\r\nof broken Stones, among which we found the pieces of two Statues, one\r\nof a Man, and another of a Woman, cut in a sitting, or rather leaning\r\nposture; and the Heads and part of the Arms of both being broken off,\r\nbut their Bodies remaining pretty entire; so that we had the Advantage\r\nof seeing their Habits, which appeared very Noble, but more approaching\r\nthe _European_ Fashion, than what is now in use in the East; which\r\ninclined me to believe they might be _Romans_. Upon broken pieces of\r\nStone tumbled here and there, we found some as broken Inscriptions, but\r\nnot affording any perfect Sense, they are not worth the Transcribing.\r\n\r\nMany other Sepulchers there were, as much gone to decay as this, which\r\ntherefore we past by, to go to two, which stood almost opposite to\r\none another, and seemed most perfect of any, though not without marks\r\nof the _Turkish_ Malice. They are two square Towers, rather larger\r\nthan ordinary Steeples, and five Stories high, the outside being of\r\ncommon Stone, but the Partitions and Floors within of good Marble;\r\nand beautified too with very lively Carvings and Paintings, and\r\nFigures both of Men and Women, as far as the Breast and Shoulders; but\r\nmiserably defac'd and broken. Under these Statues, or by their sides,\r\nare in the unknown Character, the Names probably of the Persons there\r\nburied, or by them represented; or else some other Memorials of them.\r\nWe entred one of these by a Door on the South side, from which was a\r\nWalk cross the whole Building just in the middle. But the Floor was\r\nbroke up, and so gave us a sight of a Vault below, divided after the\r\nsame manner. The Spaces on each Hand were again sub-divided into six\r\nPartitions by thick Walls, each Partition being capable of receiving\r\nthe largest Corps: And piling them one above another, as their way\r\nappears to have been, each of those Spaces might contain at least\r\nsix or seven Bodies. For the lowest, second and third Stories, those\r\nPartitions were uniform, and altogether the same; save from the second\r\nFloor, which answered the main Entrance, one Partition was reserved\r\nfor a Stair-Case. Higher than this, the Building, being something\r\ncontracted towards the top, would not afford space for the continuation\r\nof the same Method: Therefore the two uppermost Rooms were not so\r\nparted, nor perhaps ever had any Bodies lain in them. Unless it was\r\nthat of the Founder alone, whose Statue wrapt up in Funeral Apparel,\r\nand in a lying Posture, is placed in a Nich, or rather Window in the\r\nFront of the Monument, so as to be visible both within and without.\r\nNear to this Statue was the following Inscription.\r\n\r\nΤΟ ΜΝΗΜΕΙΟΝ ΕΚΤΙΣΑΝ ΕΛΑΒΗΛΕΣ ΜΑΝΝΑΙΟΣ ΣΟΧΑΕΙΣ ΜΑΛΧΟΣ ΟΥΑΒΑΛΛΑΘΟΥ ΤΟΥ\r\nΜΑΝΝΑΙΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΕΛΑΒΗΛΟΥ ΑΥΤΩ ΚΑΙ ΥΙΟΙΣ ΕΤΟΥΣ ΔΙΥ ΜΗΝΟΣ ΞΑΝΔΙΚΟΥ.\r\n\r\n'Tis a little doubtful whether ΑΥΤΩ should not rather be made ΑΥΤΟΙΣ;\r\nor else there must be a Fault in the Verb, and all those but the Names\r\nof one Person. The other Monument on the other side of the way is very\r\nmuch like this; only the Front and Entrance are towards the North, and\r\n'tis not altogether so Polite, nor so well Painted. But the Carvings\r\nare as good, and it shews altogether as Stately and Magnificent as\r\nthe former. Besides, it has the Advantage in Age of a whole Century\r\nof Years: As appears from the Date of the following Inscription. 'Tis\r\nplaced above a Nich in the Front, adorned with handsom Borders and\r\nCornishes; the place, doubtless, of some Statue, and probably that of\r\nthe Founder.\r\n\r\nΜΝΗΜΕΙΟΝ ΑΙΩΝΙΟΝ ΓΕΡΑΣ ΩΚΟΔΟΜΗΣΕΝ ΓΙΧΟΣ ΜΟΚΙΜΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΚΑΙΛΚΙΑΛΣΙΣΟΥ ΤΟΥ\r\nΜΑ......ΟΥ ΕΙΣΤΕ ΕΑΥΤΟΝ ΚΑΙ ΥΙΟΥΣ ΚΑΙ ΕΓΓΟΝΟΥΣ ΕΤΟΥΣ ΔΙΤ ΜΗΝΕΙ ΞΑΝΔΙΚΩ.\r\n\r\nThis is the most Ancient Inscription I met with in _Tadmor_, the 314th.\r\nYear from the Death of _Alexander_ the Great, preceding the Birth of\r\nour Saviour about Ten Years. The other also is between Twenty and\r\nThirty Years before the Reign of _Hadrian_, and consequently before the\r\n_Romans_ got footing here. And from these sumptuous Structures, and\r\nthese costly _Mausolæa_, we may reasonably conclude, they were a Potent\r\nand Opulent People, before they became subject to the _Romans_, and\r\nwere not obliged to them for their Greatness.\r\n\r\nAnd now I believe I have wearied you sufficiently by leading you up\r\nand down the Ancient and Famous City of _Tadmor_, and giving you so\r\ndry an Account of our Employment there. After 4 Days stay we returned,\r\nnot the way that we came, but proceeding Eastward towards the River\r\n_Euphrates_. In our way to which, the third Day, passing though a\r\nVillage called _Tieve_, upon a Stone set wrong End upwards, in the\r\nmidst of the Wall of the Mosch, we met with the following Inscription.\r\n\r\nΔΙΙ ΜΕΓΙΣΤΩ ΚΕΡΑΥΝΙΩ ΥΠΕΡ ΣΩΤΗΡΙΑΣ ΤΡΑ: ΑΔΡΙΑΝΟΥ ΣΕΒ... ΤΟΥ ΚΥΡΙΟΥ\r\nΑΓΑΘΑΝΓΕΛΟΣ ΑΒΙΛΗΝΟΣ ΤΗΣ ΔΕΚΑΠΟΛΕΟΣ ΤΗΝ ΚΑΜΑΡΑΝ ΩΚΟΔΟΜΗΣΕΝ ΚΑΙ ΤΗΝ\r\nΚΛΙΝΗ.... ΕΞ ΙΔΙΩΝ ΑΝΕΘΗΚΕΝ ΕΤΟΥΣ ΕΜΥ ΜΗΝΟΣ ΛΩΟΥ.\r\n\r\nAnd under this was another in the same Language and Character we had\r\nseen at _Tadmor_; I was surprized to find such an Inscription in this\r\nPlace, nor can any way guess how they should come by it: And the\r\nmention of _Decapolis_ makes me still more in the Dark. If one might\r\nextend the Bounds of _Decapolis_, as some are said to have done, as\r\nfar as _Cælosyria_, and comprize under this Name again all _Syria_,\r\n_Phænicia_ only excepted, then need it not be brought from elsewhere,\r\nbut first set up in this Village. But this will not be allowed by those\r\nwho make _Decapolis_ only a part of _Palestine_. The Matter of Fact it\r\ncontains is only an Account of the Magnificence of this _Agathangelus\r\nAbilenus_, whoever he was; who for the safety of the Emperor _Hadrian_,\r\nerected at his own Charges, and Dedicated to _Jupiter_ the Thunderer, a\r\nRoyal Banquetting-House, (for so I take [17]ΚΑΜΑΡΑ to signifie) and a\r\nBed of State; for after ΚΛΙΝΗ there is doubtless a Letter omitted, and\r\nit ought to be ΚΛΙΝΗΝ. The Date 445 agrees to the Year of our Lord 123.\r\nwhich was the seventh of the Reign of _Hadrian_. And the Month ΛΩΟΣ is\r\nour _August_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _Arsoffa._]\r\n\r\nThe next Day we past by the Ruins of a large Monastery of the\r\n_Maronites_, as I guess it to have been by an Inscription we met with\r\nupon the Capitals of several Marble Pillars, which supported the middle\r\nIsle of a handsome Church, which was to this effect.\r\n\r\n† ΕΠΙ ΣΕΡΓΙΟΥ ΕΠΙΣΚΟ. ΤΟΥ ΣΥΝΓΕΝ~ ΜΑΡΩΝΙΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΧΩΡΕΠΙΣΚΟ.\r\n\r\nFrom thence we past on, and came the same Night to _Euphrates_, and\r\nhaving travelled two Days on the Banks of that Famous River, we came to\r\nthe Tents of the King of the _Arabs_, who had furnish'd us with a Guide\r\nfor our Voyage. With him we remained two Nights, and in two Days Travel\r\nmore came back safe to _Aleppo_, having been out in the whole just 18\r\nDays.\r\n\r\n_The Reverend and Learned Author of this Account, cannot with Justice\r\nbe censured, if some Minute Particulars of the History of this Place,\r\nhave escaped his Memory, being obliged to write without recourse to the\r\nBooks proper for his purpose, which were not to be had in that Country.\r\nWe have since procured a Curious Prospect of these Noble Ruins, taken\r\non the Place; which, with some further Remarks thereon, are here\r\nPublished._\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] This _Assyne_ was in the Year of our Lord 1693. Deposed by the\r\n_Turks_, and one _Dor_ advanced to fill his place; so that now he is\r\nconstrained to live upon Rapine, being followed by a considerable\r\nNumber of Men, who delight not to Labour, nor to live under any settled\r\nGovernment.\r\n\r\n[15] 'Tis not improbable that ΟΛΟΓΕΣΙΑΣ might have been the Name of a\r\nPerson. _Vologeses_ is a known Name in History among the _Parthian_\r\nKings; to which the other seems to bear a great Affinity.\r\n\r\n[16] _Plin. Secun. Ep. l._ 2. Tells us of one, who was accused of an\r\nIllegal Exaction of Money from a Province, _Titulo Unguentarii_; now\r\nwhat was in that case unjustly exacted, might be in this a Voluntary\r\nDonation, not of the Province to the Governour, but of a great Man to\r\nthe People. Or else _Unguentarium_ may be supposed to be a Donative,\r\nlike _Clavarium_ or _Culinarium_, used sometimes by the _Romans_.\r\n\r\n[17] This Word I find both in _Tacitus_ and _Strabo_, used for a kind\r\nof Ships or Boats, long, narrow, light, and capable of receiving 20, or\r\nat most 30 Men; but what they should do with Boats in an Inland Town,\r\nwithout either River or Lake near it, I cannot imagine. I rather adhere\r\nto the other signification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _An Extract of the Journals of two several Voyages of the _English\r\n    Merchants_ of the Factory of _Aleppo_, to _Tadmor_, anciently\r\n    call'd _Palmyra_._\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Merchants of this worthy Factory, being generally Men of more than\r\nordinary Birth and Education, have not been wanting (as the intervals\r\nof leisure from their gainful Traffick would permit) to make Voyages of\r\nCuriosity, to visit the celebrated Remains of Antiquity in those Parts,\r\nwhereby the once flourishing State of the World, under the _Roman\r\nEmpire_, is abundantly evinced. And being inform'd by the Natives,\r\nthat the Ruins of the City of _Tadmor_ were more considerable than any\r\nthey had yet seen, they were tempted to enterprize this hazardous and\r\npainful Voyage over the _Desart_; but having been, by the perfidy of\r\nthe _Arabs_, disappointed of their Desires in their first Attempt, they\r\nwere obliged to defer their Curiosity, till they could better provide\r\nfor their Security: whereof being assured, from the Confidence some of\r\nthem had in the Friendship of _Assyne_ then King of the _Arabs_, they\r\nadventured again, in the Year 1691, and had full liberty to visit,\r\nobserve and transcribe what they pleased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A View of the Ruines of =Palmyra= alias =Tadmor=, taken\r\non the Southern Side._]\r\n\r\nWhat Account they there took, the Publick has already seen in our\r\nLast, since which, by the Favour of Mr. _Timothy Lanoy_ and Mr. _Aaron\r\nGoodyear_, two very Eminent Merchants, who were both in the first\r\nVoyage, we have received not only the Draught of the Prospect of those\r\nnoble Ruins, taken upon the Place, (of which we here give a Copy,) but\r\nalso the Journals of both the Voyages; which, for the Satisfaction of\r\nthe Curious, we have thought fit to Publish.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The first Voyage_, Anno 1678.\r\n\r\n_July 18._ at Five in the Morning, we set out from _Aleppo_, being\r\nsixteen _English_; but with Servants and Mulettiers in all forty; and\r\nin four Hours and an half, travelling South by East, we arrived at a\r\nVillage call'd _Cafferabite_, being at the edge of the Desart, here we\r\nreposed the rest of that Day.\r\n\r\n_July 19._ we rose at one in the Morning, and directed our Course S. S.\r\nE. over the Desart, for a Fountain call'd _Churraick_; but our Guide\r\nlosing his Way, there being no Path, 'twas near Noon before we found\r\nit: which made us doubt of our Safety. This Well has no Signs near it\r\nto discover it by. Here we pitch'd our Tents, and refresh'd our Selves\r\nand Horses; and the Water being of a Purgative Quality, made us some\r\nDiversion. In our way, we found two _Arabs_ with two Asses, one whereof\r\ncarried Water and a little Bread, the other they rod on by turns; they\r\nhad one Gun, with which they they shot Antelopes, the Bullet being a\r\nhard Stone broken round, and cased with Lead; they had on the Palms\r\nof their Hands, Elbows, Knees and Feet, some Antelope-Skin tied, that\r\nthey may be able to creep the better on the Ground, to Shoot; one of\r\nthe Asses walking by as a Stalking-horse, and the _Arab_ imitating the\r\nCry of the Gazel till he get within Shot: These _Arabs_ are called\r\n_Selebee_. At the Well came to us some _Arabs_ that were making Ashes\r\nof the ordinary sort of Weeds call'd _Chuddraife_, _Ruggot_ and\r\n_Cuttaff_; these they cut and dry, and putting them into a Pit, set\r\nFire to them, and the Ashes cake at the bottom. The Ashes they carry to\r\n_Eglib_ and _Tripoli_, to make Soap of: But the best sort of Ashes are\r\nmade of the Weed _Shinon_, which grows about _Tadmor_, _Soukny_, _Tibe_\r\nand _Yarecca_; it grows like Broom in _England_, and in Shape resembles\r\nCoral.\r\n\r\n_July 20._ we rose at four in the Morning, and Travelling two Hours E.\r\nS. E. we arrived at _Andrene_, where we found the Ruins of two or three\r\nChurches, and of a great Town lying in a large Plain; where having\r\ntarried about an Hour and an half, and taken some fragments of Greek\r\nInscriptions, which afforded no certain Sense, but yet were evidently\r\nChristian, we march'd again S. by E. and in about four Hours time\r\ncame to a pleasant Aqueduct call'd _Sheck-alal_; this Aqueduct is cut\r\nthrough the main Rock, for a great way from the Mountains; and where\r\nit ends, the _Arabs_ have made a Garden, which afforded us Melons,\r\nCucumbers, Purslain, _&c._ In a Grotto hard by, there dwelt an _Arab_\r\nwith his Family; he had a dozen _Buffalo's_, which they used both for\r\ntheir Milk, and to Plow the Ground, Sowing both Wheat, and Barly:\r\nHither the _Arabs_ resort, when they have committed any Robbery about\r\n_Aleppo_, or _Hama_, and here they repose, and divide the Spoil.\r\n\r\n_July 21._ we rose at four in the Morning, and riding two Hours South,\r\nwe came to a Ruin call'd _Briadeen_; here we found the following\r\nInscription on a Stone, good part in the Ground:\r\n\r\n                   ΑΦΙΕΡΩΘΗ ΑΑΙΛΥΝΔΙΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΑΜΦ ΕΤΟΥΣ\r\n              ΔΙΑ ΜΑΤΕΡΝΟΥ ΚΑ(Ι Π)ΑΠΠΟΥ ΚΑΙ ΜΑΙΚΟΥ ΚΝΕΤΜΝ\r\n                         -------- Υ -------- Ν\r\n\r\nFrom hence going South-East, in four Hours more we came to a Well\r\ncalled _Costal_ (which signifies a _Spring in Arab_.) Most part of\r\nour way through the Desart we were troubled with _Rat-holes_ in great\r\nnumbers, like Coneyboroughs, which by the sinking in of the Earth, very\r\nmuch incommoded our Horses and Mules. These _Rats_ have at the ends of\r\ntheir Tails a bush of Hair, and the _Arabs_ eat them all, excepting one\r\npart. From this Well we arose about four in the Afternoon, and began to\r\nascend small Hills, covered with Trees, which, for the most part, were\r\nthe small _Pistacho_'s which the _Arabs_ pickle with Salt; but eaten\r\ngreen, are good to quench Thirst. We travelled on three Hours up the\r\nHills, where we pitch'd that Night, having no other Water but what we\r\ncarry'd with us; and at Night we had a small Shower of Rain, a thing\r\nunusual in that Country at that time of the Year.\r\n\r\n_July 22._ we rose by Two in the Morning, and Travelling E. S. E.\r\nwe came by Eleven to a Well call'd _G'hor_, where we found it very\r\nHot, and saw several prints of Horses Feet, so that we suspected some\r\n_Arabs_ had newly past that way.\r\n\r\n_July 23._ we rose by One in the Morning, and Travelling most East,\r\nwe came to a large Plain, where we saw before us, on a high Mountain,\r\na great Castle, call'd by the _Arabs_ _Anture_. When we had travelled\r\ntwo or three Hours in this Plain, we espied an _Arab_ driving towards\r\nus a Camel, with his Launce, so fast, that he came on a round Gallop,\r\nand we supposed him sent as a Spy: being come up to us, he told us he\r\nwas of _Tadmor_, and that his Prince, the _Emir Melkam_, had that Day\r\nmade Friendship with _Hamet Shideed_ another Prince, and that together\r\nthey had four hundred Men; so he kept us Company an Hour or two, and\r\nenquired of our _Mulettiers_ if we were not _Turks_ disguised, with\r\nintent to seize on _Melkam_; for we travelled with a _Bandiero_, the\r\nImpress being a _Hanjarr_ or _Turkish_ Dagger, and a Half-Moon. We told\r\nhim we were _Franks_, which he could hardly believe, wondering that we\r\ntravelled thus in the Desart, only out of Curiosity. Being come near to\r\n_Tadmor_, he went a little before us, and on a sudden run full speed\r\ntowards the Ruins, we not endeavouring to hinder him. Our Guide told\r\nus he was gone to acquaint the _Arabs_ who we were, and that we ought\r\nto suspect and prepare for the worst; so we dismounted twenty of our\r\nServants, each having a long Gun, and Pistols at his Girdle, and placed\r\nthem abreast before us: we following at a little distance behind, on\r\nHorse-back, with Carbines and Pistols. In this order we proceeded, and\r\ncame to a most stately _Aqueduct_, which runs under Ground in a direct\r\npassage five Miles, and is covered with an Arch of Bastard Marble\r\nall the Way, and a Path on both sides the Channel for two Persons to\r\nwalk abreast; the Channel it self being about an _English_ Yard in\r\nbreadth, and ¾ of a Yard in depth. At 20 Yards distance all the way\r\nare Ventiducts for the Air to pass, and the holes are surrounded with\r\nsmall Mounts of Earth to keep the Sand and Dust from falling down.\r\nWe marched close by these Mounts, which might serve us for Defence,\r\nexpecting every moment that the _Arabs_ would come to Assail us, having\r\nthe disadvantage of Sun and Wind in our Faces: wherefore we Travelled\r\nhard to gain an Eminence where we might Post our selves advantageously,\r\nand stop and repose a little, to consider what we had to do. The\r\n_Arabs_ finding us to come on with this Order and Resolution, thought\r\nnot fit to adventure on us, so we gained the Hill, from whence we might\r\ndiscern these vast and noble Ruins, having a Plain like a Sea for\r\ngreatness to the Southwards of it. Here having refresh'd our Men, we\r\nfetch'd a little Compass and descended by the foot of a Mountain, on\r\nwhich stands a great Castle, but uninhabited. Here two _Arabs_ came to\r\nus with Lances, one being Chiah to _Melkam_, and we sent two to meet\r\nthem; they gave the _Salam alika_, and ours returned the _Alica salam_,\r\nand advancing to our Company, told us the _Emir_ had understood of our\r\ncoming, and had sent them to acquaint us that he was our Friend, and\r\nthat all the Country was ours. We sent back with them our _Janizary_\r\nand a Servant to visit the Prince in his Tents, which were in a Garden.\r\nIn the mean time we dismounted at a watering Place amidst the Ruins,\r\nbut did not unload till our _Janizary_ and Servant returned with the\r\n_Emir's Tescarr_, assuring us of Friendship and Protection, a Writing\r\nwhich the _Arabs_ were never known to violate before. With them came\r\nalso one that belonged to the _Sheck_ of the Town, for whom we had\r\nLetters from _Useffe Aga_ the _Emeer_ of _Aleppo_. He desired us for\r\ngreater Security to pitch our Tents under the Town Walls, which is\r\nin the Ruins of a great Palace, the Wall yet standing very high, the\r\nTown within but small, and the Houses excepting two or three no better\r\nthan Hog-sties. So we pitched in a deep Sandy Ground where we found it\r\nexceeding hot. Here we waited till three of the Clock without eating\r\nany thing, expecting the _Sheck_ should have presented us according to\r\nthe usual Custom of the _Turks_ to their Friends, and have given some\r\nanswer to the Letters we brought him; but on the contrary we found\r\nby the gesture of the People, that we had Reason to suspect them.\r\nHereupon two of our Company believing that the want of a present to\r\nthe _Emir_ was the cause thereof resolved to adventure to give him a\r\nVisit, and taking the _Janizary_ and one Servant, they carried him a\r\nPresent of two pieces of Red Cloath, and four of Green, and several\r\nother things: Being come he welcomed them into his Tent, and placed the\r\none on his right Hand and the other on his left. _Melkam_ was a young\r\nMan, not above Five and Twenty, and well Featur'd, and a most Excellent\r\nHorse-man; _Hamet Shideed_, the other Prince, was more elderly, as\r\nabout forty Years of Age, and was not in the Tent, but sat under a\r\n_Palm-Tree_ near it. He treated them with _Coffee_, _Camel's-flesh_\r\nand _Dates_, and enquired of their Journey, and the Cause of their\r\ncoming: They told him 'twas only Curiosity to see those Ruins; he said\r\nthat formerly _Solomon Ibnel Doud_ Built a City in that Place, which\r\nbeing destroyed, was Built again by a strange People, and he believed,\r\nthat we understanding the Writing on the Pillars, came to seek after\r\nTreasure, he having but six Moons before found a Pot of _Corra\r\nCrusses_. After this he went out of the Tent, leaving them smoaking\r\nTobacco, to the _Janizary_ and Servant, and told them, that never till\r\nthat Day any _Franks_ had been at that Place, and that now we knew the\r\nway through the Desert, we might inform the _Turks_ to their Ruin and\r\nDestruction, so that 'twould be convenient for them to destroy us all:\r\nBut that we coming as Friends, he would only have 4000 Dollars as a\r\nPresent, else he would hang them and the two _Franks_ up, and go fight\r\nthe rest. This Message being brought them, they wish'd they had excus'd\r\nthemselves from this Embassy, and answered, they could say nothing to\r\nthat Demand, not knowing our Minds, but if he would permit them to go\r\nand speak with the rest, they would return an Answer. Hearing this, he\r\nthreatened present Death, but at length gave leave to our _Janizary_\r\nto carry us a Letter from them, wherein they shewed the danger they\r\nwere in, and earnestly entreated us to redeem them, the Price set on\r\nthem being 2000 Dollars, one half in Mony, the other half in Goods, as\r\nSwords, Cloaths, Tents, _&c._ which the _Emir_ promised to estimate at\r\ntheir Worth.\r\n\r\nThis Letter amazed us mightily, and a little before it arrived,\r\nwe understanding a little, and fearing more ill Treatment to our\r\nFriends, were getting ready to free them or die with them. The Garden\r\nwhere _Melkam_ lay, was about half a Mile from the Tents, full of\r\n_Palm-Trees_, and had no Walls, but loose Stones piled up Breast high\r\nabout them, so we designed to have gone suddenly and given two or three\r\nVolleys on them, e'er they could get to Horse; and the _Arab_ know not\r\nhow to Fight on Foot. And though they bragg'd they had 400 Men, we\r\nsupposed 200 might be the most, and they not all Lances. But on receipt\r\nof this Letter, and the Servants telling us that they would certainly\r\nbe cut off, if we endeavoured their Rescue, we began to examin what\r\nMoneys we had, Cloaths and other Trade, and found we could not near\r\nmake up that Sum. In this Confusion came two _Arabs_ to receive the\r\nthings, and immediately Word was brought that the _Emir_ would come\r\nand Visit us; we sent him Word, that if he came with more than two\r\nfollowers, we would not admit him: so he came with 2 Servants only; and\r\nin conclusion, we made him up in Money and Goods to the Value of 1500\r\nDollars. He valuing our Things as we pleased; his Design being not so\r\nmuch to compleat the Sum, as to take from us all we had. After this,\r\nabout Sun Set, he returned us our two Friends, when the _Sheck_ of the\r\nTown invited us to Lodge within the Town; which we found afterwards\r\nwas with a design to have forced something from us: But we giving him\r\nto understand that the Emir had taken all already, and had left us\r\nonly our Arms and the Cloaths on our Backs; which if they would have,\r\nthey must Fight for: That Resolution daunted them, and away they went,\r\npromising us Barley for our Horses in the Morning. We kept good watch\r\nin the Night, and when Day broke, we began to consider how to clear our\r\nselves; we expected the Barly till Nine in the Morning, when it came,\r\nand the Emir himself came and gave us the good Morrow: We feared least\r\nthey should pretend to stop some of us in the Gate-way, so we placed\r\nsix of our Company to secure the Passage, 'till all the rest were got\r\nout, under pretence of taking an Inscription that was over the Gate.\r\nBeing all got clear, we returned by the same way we came and arrived at\r\n_Aleppo_ _July 29._ in the Morning. This _Melkam_ told us, That if we\r\nhad not submitted our selves to his Demands, he was resolved to Fight\r\nus after this Method: Loading 50 Camels with Baggs of Sand, and making\r\nsmall holes in the Baggs for the Sand to drop out, he would drive\r\nthese Camels abreast upon us before the Wind, that the Sand might blow\r\nin our Eyes, and we spending our Bullets on the Camels, might so be\r\neasily overthrown; we answered, that we believed he would not venture\r\nhis Camels and Horses to such a Combat. He wondered extreamly when we\r\ntalk'd of Shooting Birds flying, and Hares running.\r\n\r\nThis and other the like Violences used by this _Arab_ Prince, made\r\nthe _Bassa_ of _Aleppo_ resolve to destroy him; and not long after he\r\ncajoled him with the Hopes of being made King of the _Arabs_, and to\r\ndraw him near the City, he vested and caressed some of his Followers:\r\nWhich having its effect, the _Bassa_ surprized him in his Tents by\r\nNight, and soon after he was put to Death: This those People were\r\nwilling to believe the effect of their so abusing the _English_, and\r\nmight much contribute to the Security and good Usage they found, that\r\nwent the second time on this Expedition.\r\n\r\nWe had not time to view these Ruins by reason of this usage, though\r\nperhaps we might with safety. We only took one of the Inscriptions as\r\nwe past by, which was thus.\r\n\r\nΣΕΠΤΙΜΙΟΝ ΟΥΟΡΟΔΗΝ ΤΟΝ ΚΡΑΤΙΣΤΟΝ ΕΠΙΤΡΟΠΟΝ ΣΕΒΑΣΤΟΥ ΔΟΥΚΗΝΑΡΙΟΝ ΚΑΙ\r\nΑΡ..ΑΠΗΤΗΝ ΙΟΥΛΙΟΣ ΑΥΡΗΛΙΟΣ ΣΑΝΜΗΣ ΜΑΣΣΙΑΝΟΥ ΤΟΥ Μ..ΛΕΝΑΙΟΥ ΙΠΠΕΥΣ\r\nΡΟΥΜΑΩΝ ΤΟΝ ΦΙΛΟΝ ΚΑΙ ΠΡΟΣΤΑΤΗΝ ΕΤΟΥΣ Η Ο Φ ΜΗΝΕΙ ΞΑΝΔΙΚΩ.\r\n\r\nWherein the principal difference is in the Word ἀραπήτην, which\r\nin the Account already Published is read ἀράπετην, which seems to\r\nsignifie some peculiar Officer of the _Syrians_, as _Ducenarius_ of\r\nthe _Latins_, which perhaps those skill'd in the Oriental Customs and\r\nLanguages may be able to expound.\r\n\r\nAs far as we could conclude from our Journeys, and the Position of\r\nthe Ways taken by two good Compasses, the Distance of _Tadmor_ from\r\n_Aleppo_ is about a 150 English Miles, and the Course S. S. E. or\r\nrather somewhat more Southerly, considering the Variation of the\r\nCompass, which is above a half a Point Westward in these Parts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The second Voyage_, Anno 1691.\r\n\r\nWe set out from _Aleppo_ for _Tadmor_ on _Michaelmas-day_, being in\r\nall, Masters and Servants, thirty Men, well armed, having obtained\r\na Promise of Security from _Assyne_, then King of the _Arabs_, and\r\none of his own People for a Guide. This Day our Road pointed S. b.\r\nE. and in four Hours we came to a Fountain call'd _Caphir-Abiad_,\r\nleaving Old _Aleppo_ about an Hour distant on the right Hand: Here we\r\nmade but a very short stay, but proceeded to a better Fountain at the\r\nfoot of a very high Hill, cover'd with loose Stones, the Ruins of a\r\nVillage called _Broeder_, of which there was not one House remaining;\r\nand dining here, we advanced in an Hour and a quarter more, in the\r\nAfternoon, through a fertile open Place, to a Place called _Emghir_,\r\nfamous for the best Wheat that is brought to _Aleppo_. This we made\r\nour first Stage; and mounting again in the Morning about five a Clock,\r\nin less than an Hour, past by an uninhabited Village, call'd _Urghee_,\r\nour Road pointing as before, through the fruitful Plain, even and\r\npleasant; but when we came to ascend the Hills, where I reckon'd we\r\nentred the Desart, and were to take our leave of Mankind, at least of\r\nan inhabited Country for some Days, we had a troublesome Passage, over\r\nloose great Stones, without any appearance of a Road.\r\n\r\nOur Guide had promised to conduct us through pleasant Groves and\r\nForests; but no such thing appeared, unless we would bestow that Name\r\nupon low withered Shrubs that grew in the Way, only one Tree we saw,\r\nwhich was of good use to us, serving as a Land-mark; and when we were\r\ncome up with it, being left at a little distance on the right Hand,\r\nwe gain'd the Prospect of a remote ridge of Hills before us, and on\r\nthe top of one of them an old Castle; this Castle, we were told, was\r\nknown by the Name of _Gazar Ibn Wordan_; but what it anciently was, or\r\nin what Condition it is at present, I could not learn; therefore, not\r\nunwillingly, I turned my Eyes from it, to a little round Hill more on\r\nthe left, by which we were to direct our Course, and about a quarter of\r\nan Hour from which stood a Sheck's House, call'd _Sheck Ailha_, where\r\nwe were to bait, with a Well of Water by it, but such that we had but\r\nlittle _gusto_ to taste, though it served our Horses: All the Country\r\nhereabouts is stor'd with _Antelopes_, and there is a barbarous sort\r\nof People there, that have hardly any thing else to live upon, but what\r\nof these they can kill; and Necessity has taught them to be no mean\r\nArtists in their way, for they lie down behind the Stones, and as the\r\npoor harmless Creature passes, shoot them; and though their Guns be\r\nvery ordinary, exceeding heavy and thick, with Match-Locks, yet are\r\nthey such excellent Marks-men, that they kill many. That Morning we\r\nhad Travelled about five Hours to reach _Sheck Ailha_'s; yet finding\r\nnothing to invite our stay there, (though there were four or five Tombs\r\nthere not ill made, according to the _Turkish_ mode) about one a Clock\r\nwe mounted again, bending to the S. E. or something more Easterly. In\r\nour way we had two remarkable Prospects, one on the right Hand, of the\r\nRuins of an ancient City call'd _Andreen_, and sometimes _Londrine_,\r\nwhich we were told had been formerly inhabited by _Franks_, and that\r\nthere were many Inscriptions there; but it was too far out of our way,\r\nand withal something too dangerous too, for us to take a view of them:\r\nThe other, on the left Hand, was another Tree, not far from which\r\nour Guide assured us of good Water, where we designed to take up our\r\nLodging; the hopes of the Water made us slight a Well we past by on\r\nthe Road, at which afterwards we repented we had not stay'd; for when\r\nwe came up with the Tree, from which we had declined a great way to\r\nthe right, we found our Water still at a very great distance, and were\r\nconstrained to take new Directions by a white chalky Hill, almost as\r\nfar as we could see, and yet not much beyond the Place which was to\r\nbe our Stage; on therefore we proceeded till Sun-set, very weary, and\r\nalmost without hope of our coming to Water that Night, though at the\r\nsame time near dead with Thirst; and which the more supriz'd us, our\r\nGuide was advanced a great way before, out of our sight, upon what\r\ndesign we knew not, but at his return, we found it was only to assure\r\nhimself better of the way, and in an Hours time more he brought us to\r\nthe side of a Bog, call'd by the Name of _Zerga_, where, such as it\r\nwas, we found Water enough, but it was neither palatable nor wholsome,\r\nneither did the Ground seem proper to Sleep upon; yet we were forced to\r\nbe content, there being no removing thence that Night.\r\n\r\n_October 1._ We departed from _Zerga_, about two Hours before Sun-rise,\r\nand as soon as it was light, had the Prospect of a very high Hill,\r\nwhich was to be the bounds of our Travel that Day. To this we made as\r\ndirectly as we could look, finding nothing in our way observable either\r\nto arrest our curiosity, or to slacken our Pace, except a multitude of\r\nHoles made in the sandy Earth, by Rats, Serpents, and other Animals,\r\nwhich render'd our Riding a little troublesome; as we had found it\r\nupon the same Account the Afternoon before. About two Hours short of\r\nour Stage, we were shewn three little round Hills lying to the right\r\nin a direct line, known by the Name of _Tenage_; where we were told\r\nthere was good Water, and it's for that reason only they deserve the\r\nnotice of those that Travel through such a thirsty Desart. The Place to\r\nwhich we directed our Course was called _Esree_, where we arrived about\r\neleven a Clock, and found to our great Satisfaction, that our Guide\r\nhad not deceived us in his Promise of excellent Water: Here we could\r\ndiscern the Foundations of a spacious City, and a piece of a thick\r\nWall, built of a chalky Stone, was standing: This we judged to be the\r\nremainder of a Castle situated on the side of the Hill, so as both to\r\ndefend and command the City. On the top of the Hill, above the Castle,\r\nstands the Ruins of a Fabrick, in appearance very Ancient, built of\r\nvery hard Stone, yet exceedingly worn by the Weather; 'tis of an\r\noblong Figure, pointing near to the N. E. and S. W. with only one Door\r\non the Easterly end, which was once adorned with extraordinary good\r\nCarvings, of which there are still some remains, but the greatest part\r\nis either worn away, or purposely defaced; and those marks of ancient\r\nBeauty that remain are very obscure, and difficultly discernable; the\r\noutside of the Walls is beautified with Pilasters quite round, with\r\ntheir Pedestals and Capitals regular and handsom; but the Roof is\r\nall fallen down, and within appears nothing which looks either great\r\nor beautiful. The Situation, and placing the Door, hinders one from\r\nconjecturing it to have been a Christian Oratory, or Chappel, and\r\ntherefore in probability it must have been a Heathen Temple; and if so,\r\nthen the piece of the Castle Wall being of a softer Stone, must be much\r\nmore modern; the goodness of the Water brings the _Arabs_ (who rove\r\nup and down the Desart) and the _Turk-men_ frequently hither, which\r\nhas occasion'd a great many Graves about the Temple; and some have had\r\nleisure, and, (which is more difficult to be imagin'd) skill enough to\r\nscratch in the Walls the first Letters of their Names, and many more in\r\nArabick Characters, which we could make nothing of, no more than of an\r\nArabick Inscription which lay hard by, but appeared not ancient.\r\n\r\n_October_ the 2d. We departed from _Esree_, about an Hour, or an Hour\r\nand an half after Midnight, and in six Hours and an half arrived at\r\ntwo Wells, the Water 18 Fathom and 2 Foot deep, known by the Name of\r\n_Imp malcha Giub_: Through the greatest part of this Stage we had a\r\nbroad beaten Road, and where that was not discernible, we guided our\r\nselves by a ridge of chalky Hills, under which the Wells lay; the\r\nWater we found exceeding bad, and of so noisome a Scent, that we could\r\nnot endure it so much as at our Noses; which made our Guide laugh at\r\nus, who told us, the _Arabs_, and even the King himself used to drink\r\nfreely of it; which, I am sure, our Horses would not do, though they\r\nwere under a necessity of drinking that or none: For our selves we had\r\nbrought from _Esree_ Water, sufficient for one Day at least. In our way\r\nhither we were shewn the true Plant which they burn for Soap-Ashes,\r\nwhich has no Leaves, but a soft juicy Stalk shooting into several\r\nBranches, and something resembling our Camphire, only it's more round\r\nthan that; the Ashes likewise we saw, which were made not far from the\r\nWells, which in burning run into Cakes, not much unlike the Cinders of\r\na Forge, only they are heavier, and not so full of Pores, nor so hard\r\nas they are. In the Afternoon, we proceeded on our Voyage two Hours\r\nand an half, to a place called _Almyrrha_, passing rather between than\r\nover the Hills, though we had something of an ascent too; this we did\r\nto shorten our Stage the next Morning, for we were told before-hand we\r\nshould find no Water upon those Mountains; so, for our Selves, we liv'd\r\nupon our old Stock, and our Horses were constrain'd to pass that Night\r\nwithout Water. Our Journy hitherto had been altogether Southerly, and\r\nbut little varying to the Eastward of due South.\r\n\r\n_October_ the 3d. We mounted from _Almyrrha_ between five and six\r\nin the Morning, making to the point of a high ridge of Mountains,\r\nthrough an uneven Desart Way, frequently interrupted with Gutts and\r\nChannels, probably made by the descent of the Waters from the Hills,\r\nupon sudden Rains: We came to the ascent after about four Hours\r\nTravel, which we found not difficult; and when we were on the top,\r\nwe had a pleasant Prospect of the Country, and what we rejoyced at\r\nmost, we were shewn a little Hill, just behind which, we were told lay\r\n_Tadmor_. This Mountain was cover'd on both sides with great plenty\r\nof Turpentine-Trees, which was an Object very pleasing, having seen\r\nvery few greens in our whole Journey: This Tree grows very thick and\r\nshady, and several of them we saw loaded with a vast abundance of\r\nsmall round Nut, the chief use whereof is to make Oil, though some eat\r\nthem, and account them as great a Regalio as Pistaches; their outward\r\nHusk is green, and more Oily than that of Pistaches, and within a\r\nvery thin Shell is contained a Kernel both in colour and relish very\r\nmuch resembling them; but those that eat them, seldom take the Pains\r\nto search for the Kernels, but eat Husk and Shell all together, which\r\nhave no ungrateful Taste: From this Hill we had a tedious descent,\r\nand coming at the foot into a narrow Gut, winding this way and that\r\nbetween the Mountains, our Passage seemed very long, hot and tiresome;\r\nour want of Water however obliged us to proceed, whereof we now began\r\nto be in great necessity, especially for our Horses and Mules, who had\r\nnone the Night before, nor none all that Day; with this we had hopes\r\nof being supplied two different ways; having had a shower of Rain the\r\nNight before, we hoped to have found Water standing in the hollows of\r\nthe Rocks; but either the Rain had not reach'd so far, or not in such\r\nplenty as to fill those naturally hewed Cisterns: Our other expectation\r\nwas from the Wells that were in the Road; but these our Guide advancing\r\nbefore and examining, met us with the unwelcome News, that they were\r\nall dried up, and the best Advice he could give us, was to pitch where\r\nwe were, and content our selves with the remains of what we had brought\r\ntwo Days in our Vessels, till our Horses and Mules might be sent to a\r\nFountain two Hours out of our way, and being watered there themselves,\r\nbring a fresh supply for us: This way, with some difficulty, we\r\nassented to, as more eligible, than weary as we were, to wander so far\r\nout of the Road, to have the same Ground to stage over again the next\r\nMorning: We resolved therefore to send our Guide, with one or two of\r\nour Servants, in search of the Water, and afterwards others with our\r\nHorses, while in the mean time we pitch'd our Tents, it being then\r\nabout two a Clock in the Afternoon: As soon as they were gone, a small\r\ndrizzling Rain, which we had about half an Hour, encreased to a very\r\nplentiful Shower, which put us upon producing all the Vessels we had\r\nto catch it as it fell from the Heavens, or ran down the Skirts of\r\nour Tents, our Horses at the same time greedily drinking it from the\r\nGround; but we might have spared our Pains, for in less than half an\r\nHours time, our Camp was in a manner a-float, and we were surrounded\r\nwith Water not only sufficient for us, but for an Army of 20000 Men;\r\nthose hollow Gutts which we passed over without the least appearance of\r\nmoisture, were, by the Cataracts which descended from the Mountains,\r\nbecome Rivers; and our Guide with those Servants we had sent out, that\r\nbefore rode over it dry, it being swoln to such a Torrent, were put to\r\nsome difficulty to repass it; so plentifully was God pleased to provide\r\nfor us in our greatest streight; and which encreases both the Wonder\r\nand Mercy, the next Morning, all this great quantity of Water was past\r\naway, so that in about two Hour's Riding we could hardly perceive that\r\nthere had been any Rain at all. This memorable Place is known by the\r\nName of _Al-Wishal_.\r\n\r\n_October_ the 4th. From _Al-Wishal_ we proceeded for _Tadmor_, some\r\nof the Ruins of which we perswaded our selves we could see the Day\r\nbefore; perhaps it might be the Castle, which is more than half an\r\nHour's distance from the City; our way lay Southward, but the Gut\r\nin which we travelled would not permit us to keep a direct course:\r\nHowever, in about an Hour's Walk, we past by _Antor_ Mountains (our\r\nGuide call'd them _Toul Antor_) through a Gut or Rent, both sides of\r\nwhich so directly answered one to the other, they would tempt a Man to\r\nbelieve they were separated by Art, for an entrance into the Country;\r\nbut it must have been a work of prodigious Labour and Charges to have\r\ncut through such vast Mountains: And if any one was so hardy as to\r\nattempt it, he certainly grew weary of his Undertaking; for the Ground\r\nis levelled but a very little way, and almost as soon as we were well\r\ngot within the open space, we were obliged to ascend another Hill, and\r\nso our Road continued over Hills and Valleys interchangeably all the\r\nway. On the left Hand, some distance from the Road, we saw a _Sheck_'s\r\nHouse on the top of a high Hill, which made a better show than usually\r\nthose Buildings do, but being assured by our Guide it was a modern\r\nStructure, and eager too to come to the principal Place we aimed at,\r\nwe would not prolong our Stage so much as to turn out of the Road, to\r\nsee more of it: So pressing still forwards, we had hardly proceeded\r\nfour Hours, when we came to the brow of a Rocky Mountain, separated\r\nfrom that whereon stands the Castle of _Tadmor_, but by a narrow\r\nValley: In which Hill, by the Way, appeared some Quarries of fine\r\nStone, which probably might afford Materials to the curious Buildings\r\nin the City. Our Guide here (according to his accustomed Diligence)\r\nadvanced some few Paces before us, and having espied three or four\r\nCountry-Fellows driving Asses towards us, he caused us to make halt, to\r\ngive them an opportunity to come nearer to us, resolving to speak with\r\nthem, to know whether the Coast was clear, or if any of the Mountain\r\n_Arabs_ were then at _Tadmor_, or not. After a little space, with our\r\nArms in our Hands, we marched in as good order as the Way would permit,\r\ndown a rocky and steep Precipice, into the Valley; and our Guide making\r\ngreater speed than we could, gallop'd after the poor affrighted Country\r\nFellows; who seeing such a Company unexpectedly descend the Hill, left\r\ntheir Asses, and fled towards the City with all possible speed: But\r\nthey were soon overtaken, and brought back again to us; to whom they\r\nrelated the good News, that there was no Force at all in _Tadmor_, and\r\nthat we might proceed with Courage, and see what we would there with\r\nall safety: Which News obtained them their Liberty to go again to their\r\nAsses, and we continued in our Way.\r\n\r\nHaving tired our selves with roving from Ruin to Ruin, and rummaging\r\namong old Stones, from which little Knowledge could be obtained; and\r\nmore especially not thinking it safe to linger too long in a Place,\r\nwhere should the Mountain _Arabs_ (who were Enemies to _Assyne Abasse_,\r\nour Friend) have Intelligence of us, they might either fall upon or\r\nendeavour to intercept us in our return; (for which reason also we had\r\nall along concealed our intended Course, under a pretence of proceeding\r\nforward to _Damascus_.) On _Thursday_, _October 8._ about half an Hour\r\nafter four in the Morning, we departed from _Tadmor_, being very well\r\nsatisfied with what we had seen, and glad to have escaped so dreaded\r\na Place, without any Trouble or Pretences upon us; but else with some\r\nRegret, for having left a great many things behind, which deserved a\r\nmore particular and curious Inspection. Our Road lay almost due East,\r\nor a little inclining to the North; and on the left Hand, a ridge of\r\nHills stretched along for a great space, sometimes about half an Hour\r\ndistant from the Road, and sometimes opening wider: These Hills, we\r\nwere told, were stored with rich Veins of divers Minerals, and afforded\r\nall that vast quantity of Marble, the Remains whereof we had seen\r\nat _Tadmor_; and it was from a Fountain call'd _Abulfarras_, at the\r\nfoot of one of them, they fetch out Water, which we drank there; the\r\nInhabitants contenting themselves with that which runs from the Hot\r\nSprings. To the right Hand lay a vast barren Plain, perfectly bare,\r\nand hardly any thing green to be seen therein, except it were a few\r\nGourds which our Servants found on the side of a little rising-Ground,\r\nwhere there was no shew of any thing moist to feed them. Our Way being\r\nplain, we had the sight of _Tadmor_, especially the Castle, for above\r\nhalf our Stage, till we came to an old _Caphar_ House. We made indeed a\r\nvery short Days Journey, in the whole, finding a Fountain of excellent\r\nWater in about five Hours and a half's Riding; which, as it was a most\r\nwelcome Refreshment to us in such a thirsty Desart, so it was the only\r\ngood Water we met with till we came to _Euphrates_, which was not\r\ntill the third Day from this Place. At this Fountain we pitch'd, near\r\nto which is a Village, but almost wholly ruined and deserted. 'Twas\r\nsome time before any Body would be seen, for they were afraid of us;\r\nat length, three Men came out to our Tents, Spectacles of a miserable\r\nPoverty, occasion'd by their being frequently pillaged by the Mountain\r\n_Arabs_, and a great Duty they pay to _Assyne Abasse_ their King, for\r\nhis Protection: Three hundred Dollars they pay him Annually, when one\r\nwould think the whole Village was not able to make up the Sum of one\r\nHundred; yet being the remotest Place that was under his Jurisdiction,\r\nthey often suffer by the Inroads of the other. The Name of the Place\r\nis _Yarecca_, a Name it received (as we were inform'd) from a Victory\r\nobtained there by the _Turks_ over the _Mamalukes_.\r\n\r\n_October_ the 9th. From _Yarecca_ we mounted early, and Travelling\r\nN. E. or near that Point, in seven Hours time arrived at _Soukney_.\r\nThe Road we found much like what we had the Day before, lying over a\r\nbarren Plain; only we had Hills on both sides, and sometimes closing\r\nwithin half an Hours riding one of the other. The Village has its Name\r\nfrom the Hot Waters, (for so the Word imports,) which are of the same\r\nNature with those of _Tadmor_; herein they Bath frequently, the same\r\nlittle dirty Hole serving both for Men and Women; only they have so\r\nmuch Modesty remaining, that they have different Hours for one and the\r\nother. To say the Truth, 'twas the only mark of Modesty I could observe\r\namong them; in other respects they seemed a Confident, or rather\r\nImpudent Generation of People. Before we could pitch our Tents, they\r\nflock'd about us in multitudes, Men, Women, and Children; and of the\r\nlast, many of them as naked as ever they came into the World, not so\r\nmuch as a Rag about them to cover them; and so numerous they appeared,\r\nthat if we had reason to think _Yarecca_ wanted Inhabitants, we had no\r\nless, to conclude _Soukney_ over-stock'd. At this Place usually resides\r\nan Officer of _Assyne_'s, who is their Sub-Basha, or Governor: He whom\r\nwe found there, was call'd _Dor_, of a good Family among the _Arabs_,\r\nto whom we made a Present; and he civilly return'd it in Barley for\r\nour Horses. Afterwards he came under our Tents, and invited us to an\r\nEntertainment; which, considering the Circumstances of the Place, was\r\nvery Splendid, though it was nothing but _Pilaw_ at last, a little\r\ndiversify'd by the dressing; and, to speak truly, I judge we could not\r\nhave less than a Bushel of Rice set before us. His Palace, indeed was\r\nnot very stately, there being few Cottages in _England_ but might vie\r\nwith it. To the Room wherein we were entertain'd, which, doubtless, was\r\nthe best, if not the only one he had, we were forced to clamber, rather\r\nthan ascend, by broken Steps made of Stone and Dirt. When we were got\r\nin, and commodiously seated after the _Turkish_ Mode, it seemed large\r\nenough for about a dozen or fourteen People: At the upper end was a\r\nlittle space separated from the rest by a ridge made up of Earth,\r\nwithin which, I suppose, he slept. The Walls were mean; but the Roof\r\nmuch worse, having no other Covering but Faggots; so that certainly it\r\ncould not be Proof against a Shower of Rain which fell that Night, and\r\nforced us out of our Tents, into in old ruinous _Cane_, for shelter:\r\nHowever, it served well enough for our Afternoons Collation; and we had\r\ncome away with a good Opinion of the Gentleman's Civility, had he not\r\nafterwards endeavoured to make a Pretence upon us, and so would have\r\nforced us to pay dear for our Rice: He pretended to a Customary Duty of\r\na Chequeen a Head of all _Franks_ that past that Road; though probably\r\nneither he, nor his Grand-father before him, had ever seen a _Frank_\r\nthere before. But when he understood by our Guide, that we were not so\r\neasily to be imposed upon; and withal, that we were _Assyne_'s Friends,\r\nand in our Way to his Tents; and especially our Treasurer a Person he\r\nvery much esteemed, who therefore would be sure to acquaint him with\r\nany Exaction or Injury offer'd us, his Mouth was quickly stop'd, and he\r\ngrew so sensible of his Error, that he sent to excuse it, and presented\r\nour Treasurer with a Fan of Black Ostrich Feathers; and not only so,\r\nbut in the Morning came himself, and begging Pardon, desired nothing\r\nmight be said of what had past, and so conducted us about an Hour on\r\nour way. This Village pays to _Assyne_ fifteen hundred Dollars _per\r\nAnnum_.\r\n\r\n_October_ the 10th. Continuing our Voyage still to the N. E. or\r\nsomething more Easterly, we found it another pleasant and easie Stage\r\nto another Village call'd _Tiebe_, so called (as they say) from the\r\ngoodness of the Water, the Word signifying _good_: But we found them\r\nnot so over excellent; they had the Tast, and were doubtless tinctured\r\nwith the same Mineral, with those of _Soukney_ and _Tadmor_, though not\r\nso strong. But the Village it self made a better Shew than usual; and\r\nthe People appear'd of something better Fashion, and more civiliz'd,\r\nthan those we had left. It's pleasantly situated, and makes a good\r\nappearance as one comes up to it; the Prospect being helped by a well\r\nbuilt Steeple, to which is now adjoyned their Mosch: But I am apt to\r\nbelieve it the remains of a Christian Church, being built with more\r\nArt and Beauty than you shall easily find in Turkish Fabricks: And\r\nthere are also several Ruins about it, which speak it to have been a\r\nmore famous Place than now it is. Into the Mosch we were permitted to\r\nenter, without any Disturbance. This Village lies in one of the Roads\r\nfrom _Aleppo_ to _Bagdatt_, and pays to _Assyne_ an Annual Tribute of\r\none thousand Dollars. From hence we mounted again in the Afternoon,\r\nand proceeded about two Hours and a half farther, to shorten our next\r\nDays Stage. Having travelled this Day, in all, about seven or eight\r\nHours, the Place we pitch'd at was a Fountain, and known by the Name\r\nof _Alcome_; but neither Town nor House by it: neither was the Water\r\nfit to be Drank, being of the same nature with that of _Soukney_, and\r\nalmost as warm.\r\n\r\n_October_ the 11th. From _Alcome_ we rose about an Hour and an half\r\nafter Midnight, our Guide groping out the way, by the help of the\r\nStars, which now bended more to the North than formerly. As soon as it\r\nwas light enough to look about us, we found our selves in a wild open\r\nDesart, the Ground, in some Places covered with a sort of Heath, and\r\nin others quite bare. Nor had we travelled long after the Sun was up,\r\nbefore, by the help of a rising Ground, we discovered _Arsoffa_, the\r\nPlace whither we were tending, which gave us hopes we should quickly\r\nbe there: But having a dry tiresome Plain to traverse, and the hot Sun\r\ncausing our Mules a little to slacken their Pace, 'twas after ten a\r\nClock before we reach'd it: And which was more vexatious still, finding\r\nno Water any where near, we were necessitated to proceed forward for\r\nthe River _Euphrates_, which we found four Hours distant from hence.\r\n_Arsoffa_, or (as the _Arabs_ call it) _Arsoffa Emir_, seems to be\r\nthe remains of a Monastery, having no Town nor Village near it, and\r\nbeing one continued Pile of Building of an oblong Figure, stretching\r\nlong ways East and West, and enclosing a very capacious Area: At a\r\ndistance it makes a glittering shew, being built of _Gypsine Stone_,\r\nor Rock-Ising-glass, resembling Alabaster, but not so hard; several\r\nQuarries of which we past by in our way to it. When the Sun shines upon\r\nit, it reflects the Beams so strong, that they dazzle the Eyes of the\r\nSpectators. Art or Accuracy in the Workmanship we found none; and but\r\nvery little Carved Work, and that mean enough; nay, the very Cement\r\nthey made use of, is but little better than Dirt; so that it's no great\r\nWonder to see it in Ruins, though it has not the appearance of any\r\ngreat Antiquity. Round about were the little Apartments or Chambers for\r\nthe Monks, built Arch-wise, only one Story above Ground; but underneath\r\nare several Cells or Vaults, larger than the Chambers, which perhaps\r\nmight serve for their Schools, or Working-houses. In the midst of the\r\nArea stand the Ruins of several Buildings, some of which seem to have\r\nbeen Cisterns for Water, and it may be the Bathing-Places: But the most\r\nremarkable was one, which probably was the Abbot's or Bishop's House,\r\nthere having been something more Pains bestow'd upon it, than the rest:\r\nAnd another, which was the Relicks of their Church. This was formerly\r\nno unhandsom Structure, being built in the form of our Churches, and\r\ndistinguish'd into three Isles, of which the middle one is supported\r\nby eighteen turned Marble Pillars, with Capitals upon them, not of\r\nMarble, but of a sort of Clay, and Cast into the shape they are in, but\r\nof a Colour exactly resembling the Pillar it self. That which perswades\r\nto believe them Cast, is a Greek Inscription to be seen on all of them;\r\nthe Letters whereof are not made by Incision in the Stone, but seem to\r\nbe stamped, standing out higher than the distance between them; and on\r\none of them, by mistake, they are so placed, as to be read after the\r\nOriental manner, from the right Hand to the left. The Words are these,\r\nwith the Crucifix before, as follows:\r\n\r\n✠ ΕΠΙ ΣΕΡΓΙΟΥ ΕΠΙΣΚΟ. ΤΟΥ ΣΥΝΓΕΝ ΜΑΡΩΝΙΟΥ ΤΟΥ ΧΩΡΕΠΙΣΚΟ.\r\n\r\nFrom hence our Guide led us to the River, by the assistance of two\r\nlittle Hills, which are known by the Name of _Aff Dieu_, our way lying\r\nNorth, and a little bending to the East. The sight of the River was a\r\nvery pleasing Prospect; and to our great comfort, we found the Water\r\nvery clear, happening to be there before the Rains, and after the\r\nSnow-Waters (which swell and disturb it in the Summer-time) were all\r\npast: And our Happiness seemed the greater, having had so tedious and\r\nthirsty a Journey of at least fourteen Hours, and neither our Selves\r\nnor our Horses touch'd a drop of Water all Day. We pitch'd upon a Reach\r\nof the River, where it was not very broad, not being above half a\r\nMusket-shot over.\r\n\r\n_October_ the 12th. This Morning, about Sun-rise, we proceeded on\r\nour Voyage, keeping along the Banks of the River, which, for the\r\nmost part, led us West and North-West: And here we had pleasant\r\nTravelling, having the River on the right Hand, and Hills of Marble\r\nor other fine Stone, on the left; and delightful Groves of Tamarisk,\r\nMulberry, and other Trees to pass through. Here every thing about us\r\nlookt fresh and verdant, and we met frequently Men and Women passing\r\non their Occasions, a thing to which (in our former Stages) we had\r\nnot been accustomed. We had also a pleasing Prospect of the opposite\r\nShore, and could see a great way into _Mesopotamia_, but could meet\r\nwith no Convenience to cross the River, which we were very desirous\r\nto have done. There are no Places of Note remaining upon the River\r\neither on one side or the other, only on the farther side we saw an\r\nold Castle call'd _Giabar_, which made a good Shew, being situated on\r\nthe top of a Hill, and both for that and the way of Building, very\r\nmuch resembling that of _Aleppo_, only that is the larger, and in the\r\nmidst of a City; this less, and has neither Town nor Houses about it.\r\nOn our side we past by a _Sheck_'s House call'd _Abul-Rarra_, and the\r\nRuins of a Town a little farther, where there was a square Tower built\r\nof a very ordinary Brick, but pretty entire. After we had left these\r\nRuins, we rested to bait, under the Shadow of a Rock, wherein were many\r\nApartments and Conveniences cut to lodge in, which I suppose are made\r\nuse of in the Winter by the People, who, during the Summer, pitch\r\namong the Trees by the River-side. In the Afternoon we continued our\r\nJourney as before, keeping always at a little distance from the River,\r\ntill a little before Sun-set; when we came to a very convenient Place\r\nupon the Banks, where we took up our lodging for that Night, having\r\ntravell'd between seven or eight Hours the whole Day.\r\n\r\n_October_ the 13th. This Day we had the same Satisfaction as the Day\r\nbefore, proceeding as near the River as the Road would permit; and\r\nhaving made a Stage of about six Hours, we rested under the shade of\r\nthe Tamarisk Trees by the River side, hoping to have found conveniency\r\nto have crossed it, but we could not. In our Way we saw nothing\r\nobservable but the Ruins of a City call'd _Baulas_, where the _Turks_\r\nhad formerly a _Sangiack_; but now there is never an Inhabitant in the\r\nPlace, nor House standing, but the Ruins of Houses, and an Octagonal\r\nTower of a considerable height, _viz._ One hundred and seven Steps, and\r\nbeautified on the outside with Flourishes and an Arabick Inscription\r\nround about: It's a handsome Structure, and probably the Work of the\r\n_Mamalukes_, since whose time little has been done to adorn, but\r\nabundance to destroy and wast this Country. After Dinner, we mounted\r\nsooner than ordinary; because hoping to reach the Tents of _Assyne_,\r\nwe were unwilling it should be late when we arrived: yet we made it\r\nnear Sun-set before we got to _Fay_, a Fountain by which he lay. We\r\nhad travell'd still on the same Point N. W. with the Prospect of\r\nthe River the greater part of the Way; the nearest Reach thereof not\r\nbeing above an Hours Riding from the Fountain. On the Road we met with\r\nseveral _Bandera_'s of the _Emir_'s Soldiers, who knowing our Guide,\r\nand understanding we were going to him, gave us a very courteous\r\n_Salam_, who else, perhaps, might have treated us with another sort\r\nof Civility. The King's Tents spread over a large Plain, and took up\r\nso vast a Space, that though we had the advantage of a rising Ground,\r\nwe could not see the uttermost extent of them. His own particular\r\nTent was pretty near the middle of the rest, which were pitch'd about\r\nit, not in a circular manner, but stretching out in length as the\r\nPlain open'd, or for the better conveniency of a Current of Water,\r\nwhich from the Fountain ran through the midst of them. 'Twas not at\r\nall distinguishable from the rest, but by its bigness, and a little\r\nmore Company about it, being all made of a sort of Hair-Cloth, which\r\nseemed hardly a defence against Rain or Sun: But certainly they must\r\nfind otherwise, else their Necessity (they spending their Lives in\r\nsuch moveable Habitations) would have taught them to have contrived\r\nsomething better. It cannot well be doubted but they are descended from\r\nthe old _Arabs Scenitæ_, they living just after the same manner, having\r\nno settled Abode, but remove from Fountain to Fountain, as they find\r\nGrass for their Sheep and Camels, and Water for them and themselves.\r\nThey love to derive themselves from _Ismael_ the Son of _Abraham_; and\r\nit may be they are descended from him, but I believe they would be\r\nhard put to't to prove their Pedigree.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we alighted, we were attended by the Officers of the _Emir_,\r\nand conducted to a very noble Tent built after the _Turkish_ Mode,\r\nand pitch'd next to his own. Hither he sent to bid us welcome, and to\r\nenquire how we had past in our Voyage; and presently after we had a\r\nRepast of several Dishes of Meat set before us, to stay our Appetites\r\ntill a more plentiful Supper could be got ready. But before Supper the\r\nKing himself made us a Visit in Person, bidding us Welcome to _Fay_,\r\nand asking what we had seen in our Travels that pleas'd us? how we\r\nliked _Tadmor_? and whether we had found a Treasure there? For this\r\nNotion sticks in the Heads of these People, That the _Franks_ go to see\r\nold Ruins, only because they there meet with Inscriptions which direct\r\nthem to some hid Treasures. And therefore it's no unusual thing with\r\nthem, when they find a Stone with an Inscription on one side, to turn\r\nthat down to the Ground, that it might not be seen or read of any. But\r\nwe assur'd him we went with no such Expectations, but only out of a\r\ndesire to see the Place: Neither had we brought any thing away with us;\r\nbut a piece of Porphyry Stone, which, upon his Request, we shew'd him.\r\nWe let him see too, a kind of rude Draught which we had taken of the\r\nPlace; which he seemed to like. He made his Visit the shorter, that he\r\nmight not incommode us after our Journey; but desir'd us we would live\r\nafter our own Pleasure and to our Satisfaction, and command freely\r\nwhatever the Camp would afford; ordering some of his People constantly\r\nto attend upon us. When there was mention made of our Design to be gone\r\nthe next Morning, he answer'd, It must not be; himself was invited the\r\nnext Day, to a great Entertainment, by one of his _Grandees_, and we\r\nshould accompany him: But the Day following, he would go out with us,\r\nand Hunt part of our Way towards _Aleppo_. When Supper was brought in,\r\nthere was Victuals enough for three times our Number: A large Dish of\r\n_Pilaw_ in the middle, and twelve or fifteen Dishes of several sorts\r\nof Meat about it, all dress'd after their manner, but exceeding good,\r\nand such as one might have fed heartily upon, had he not spoil'd his\r\nAppetite before. After we had Eat and Drank what we pleas'd, we rose\r\nup, and our Servants sat down in our Places; it being the Custom of the\r\n_Arabs_, and _Turks_ too, from the Highest to the Meanest, all to eat\r\nat the same Table: The best sort sit down first, and so in order till\r\nall are satisfy'd, and then what remains is carry'd away. We might,\r\nif we had pleas'd, have lodg'd under the same Tent where we eat; but\r\nhaving Tents of our own pitch'd, some of our Company chose rather to\r\nretire thither, to avoid being disturbed by too many Visitants.\r\n\r\n_October_ the 14th. The next Morning, about ten a Clock, we were told\r\nthat the King was gone to the Entertainment, and expected we should\r\nfollow him; and that two young Camels were kill'd, to furnish this\r\nsumptuous Feast; which is the highest piece of Magnificence and\r\nGreatness to which these People, whose greatest Riches consist in\r\nCamels, can arrive. The Tent was about a Furlong from ours; so mounting\r\nour Horses, we rode to it, and found it surrounded with a numerous\r\ntrain of Guests, three hundred at least, of different Sort and Quality:\r\nIt was very large of it self, and to be still more capacious, 'twas\r\nleft open toward the West. The King was seated at the North-end, about\r\nthe midst of the Tent, upon a Place raised with Cushions and Quilts,\r\nand Carpets before him: Neither did he sit cross-Legg'd, as all the\r\nrest of the Company were obliged to do, but in a leaning Posture.\r\nThey seemed to observe an exact Order in their Places; and when any\r\nPerson of Note enter'd, those that were near his Place, rose up and\r\nstood till he had seated himself. But the far greatest part could not\r\ncome within the compass of the Ring, but stood behind the Backs of the\r\nrest, leaving a spacious _Area_ vacant in the middle. When we entred,\r\nthey made room for us on the King's left Hand, which here is esteem'd\r\nthe more Honourable; where we sat down in the same Posture with those\r\nabout us, cross-Legg'd upon a thin Carpet. Before mid-day, a Carpet\r\nbeing spread in the middle of the Tent, our Dinner was brought in,\r\nbeing served up in large Wooden Bowls between two Men; and truly to my\r\napprehension, Load enough for them. Of these great Platters there were\r\nabout fifty or sixty in number, perhaps more, with a great many little\r\nones, I mean, such as one Man was able to bring in, strewed here and\r\nthere among them, and placed for a Border or Garnish round about the\r\nTable. In the middle of all was one of a larger size than all the\r\nrest, in which was the Camel's Bones, and a thin Broth in which they\r\nwere boiled: The other greater ones seemed all filled with one and the\r\nsame sort of Provision, a kind of Plumb-Broth, made of Rice, and the\r\nfleshy part of the Camel, with Currants and Spices, being of something\r\na darker Colour than what is made in our Country. The lesser were, for\r\nthe the most part, charged with Rice dress'd after several Modes, some\r\nof them having _Leben_, (a thick sour Milk) poured upon them. _Leben_\r\nis a thing in mighty Esteem in these Hot Countries, being very useful\r\nto quench Thirst: And truly we had need of it here; for I did not see a\r\ndrop of any sort of Liquor, excepting a Dish of Coffee before Dinner,\r\ndrank at this splendid Feast. Knives, Forks, Spoons, Trenchers, _&c._\r\nare silly Impertinent Things in the Esteem of the _Arabs_: However, we\r\nbeing known to make use of such things, had large Wooden Spoons laid\r\nbefore us. When the Table was thus plentifully furnish'd, the King\r\narising from his Seat, went and sat down to that Dish that was directly\r\nbefore him; and so did the rest, as many as it would contain, which\r\ncould not be much short of a hundred; and so without further Ceremony,\r\nthey fell to thrusting their Hands into the Dishes, and Eating by\r\nHandfuls: Neither was there any occasion of Carving; only because\r\nthose Dishes in the middle were too remote to be reach'd, there was\r\nan Officer on purpose, who stepping in among them, and standing in the\r\nSpaces designedly left for that end, with a long Ladle in both his\r\nHands, helpt any one according to their Desire. When the King had eaten\r\nwhat he thought fit, he rose up and wash'd, and retir'd back to his\r\nformer Seat; and we also did the like; others being ready to fill our\r\nPlaces. Nor did we continue much longer under the Tent in that numerous\r\nCrowd; for _Assyne_ perceiving us a little uneasie, and supposing\r\nwe had now sufficiently satisfy'd our Curiosity, though perhaps not\r\nour Appetites, told us we might take our Liberty, and if we thought\r\nfit retire to our Tents. This Favour we gladly accepted, and without\r\nCeremony returned, several of his Attendants waiting upon us back.\r\nHere we had another Dinner set before us; and having some of our own\r\nWine and Water to Drink with it, it went down better with us than the\r\nfamous Camel-Feast. In the Evening, the King mounted to see the flight\r\nof a new Hawk, and stay'd Abroad very late, his Hawk flying away: But\r\nshe was afterwards taken up by his Falconer; otherwise he had not been\r\nin a good Humour all that Night, being a Man that delights very much\r\nin Sport. After his return from Hawking, we went to Wait upon him at\r\nhis own Tent, to return him Thanks for his most courteous and royal\r\nReception of us, and to desire leave to depart the next Morning. Here\r\nwe found him surrounded with the chiefest of his People; and being\r\nplaced again on his left Hand, he entertain'd us with a great deal of\r\npleasant Discourse; and ask'd such Questions, as shew'd him to be a\r\nMan of extraordinary Capacity and Judgment. As for Learning, they have\r\nno such thing among them, and therefore it's not to be expected that\r\nhe should be a Scholar: But were he not a Person of more than common\r\nPrudence and Understanding, he could never have managed that Wild and\r\nUnruly People as he has done, ever since his Advancement to the Throne;\r\nwhich must therefore have been the more difficult, because as he came\r\nto it by the Deposition of his Father (though not immediately) who now\r\nlives with him as a private Man, so has he never wanted Competitors. To\r\nhis Father he pays a great deal of outward Respect, but is forced to\r\nkeep a very watchful Eye over him. After about an Hours Discourse, we\r\nwere dismiss'd.\r\n\r\n_October_ the 15th. In the Morning, _Assyne_ not being at leisure to\r\ngo a Hunting, we proceeded on our Voyage Homewards, with a great deal\r\nof Alacrity; and finding nothing remarkable in our Road, in about 3\r\nHours and an half arrived at _Seray_. And hence, after a short Repast,\r\nwe continued our Journey to _Sherby_ Fountain, which took us up about\r\nthe like space of Time. Here we accounted our selves as good as at\r\nHome, being at a Place with which we were well acquainted, and to which\r\nseveral times in the Year some or other of our Nation usually resort,\r\neither for Antelope or Hog-hunting, according to their Season; nor had\r\nwe hence above seven or eight Hours to _Aleppo_.\r\n\r\n_October_ the 16th. Getting up pretty early in the Morning, we resolved\r\nto Hunt the greatest part of our Way Home, as we did; and Dining at the\r\nfamous _Round-Hill_, whereon has been spent by the _English_ more Money\r\nthan would purchase a noble Estate round about it, in the Afternoon we\r\narrived safe at _Aleppo_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Some Account of the Ancient State of the City of _Palmyra_, with\r\n    short Remarks upon the Inscriptions found there. By _E. Halley_._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe City of _Tadmor_, whose Remains in Ruins do with so much evidence\r\ndemonstrate the once happy Condition thereof, seems very well to\r\nbe proved to be the same City which _Solomon_ the great King of\r\n_Israel_ is said to have founded under that Name in the _Desart_,\r\nboth in 1 _Kings_ 9. 18. and 2 _Chron._ 8. 16. in the Translation of\r\nwhich, the _Vulgar Latin Version_, said to be that of St. _Jerom_,\r\nhas it, _Condidit Palmyram in Deserto_. And _Josephus_ (in _lib._\r\n8. _Antiq. Jud._ wherein he treats of _Solomon_ and his Acts) tell\r\nus, that he Built a City in the Desart, and called it _Thadamora_;\r\nand the _Syrians_ at this Day (says he) call it by the same Name;\r\nbut the _Greeks_ name it _Palmyra_. The Name is therefore Greek, and\r\nconsequently has no relation to the Latin _Palma_, and seems rather\r\nderived from Παλμυός or Πάλμυς, which _Hesychius_ Interprets βασιλεὺς\r\nπατὴρ: or perhaps from Παλμύτης, which (according to the same Author)\r\nwas an _Egyptian_ God. Neither is the Word תרמר but תמר that in Hebrew\r\nsignifies a _Palm-Tree_.\r\n\r\nHistory is silent as to the Fate and Circumstances of this City,\r\nduring the great Revolutions in the several Empires of the East; but\r\nit may well be supposed, that so advanced a Garrison as this was,\r\nbeing above three hundred Miles from _Jerusalem_, continued not long\r\nin the Possession of the _Jews_, who immediately after _Solomon_, fell\r\ninto Civil Dissention, and divided their Force: so that it is not to\r\nbe doubted, but that it submitted to the _Babylonian_ and _Persian_\r\nMonarchies, and afterwards to the _Macedonians_ under _Alexander_ and\r\nthe _Seleucidæ_. But when the _Romans_ got footing into these Parts,\r\nand the _Parthians_ seemed to put a stop to their farther Conquests\r\nin the _East_, then was this City of _Palmyra_, by reason of its\r\nSituation, being a Frontier, and in the midst of a vast Sandy _Desart_,\r\nwhere Armies could not well subsist to reduce it by Force, courted and\r\ncaressed by the contending Princes, and permitted to continue a Free\r\nState, a Mart or Staple for Trade, for the Convenience of both Empires,\r\nas is abundantly made out from the Words of _Appian_ and _Pliny_.\r\n\r\n_Appian_ (_lib._ 5. _de Bellis Civil._) tells us, that _M. Antonius_,\r\nafter his Victory at _Philippi_, about forty Years before _Christ_,\r\nsent his Horse to Plunder the City of _Palmyra_, pretending only that\r\nthey were not sufficiently in the _Roman_ Interest. ὅτι Ρωμαίων καὶ\r\nΠαρθυαίων ὄντες ἔφοροι ἐς ἑκατέρας ἐπιδεξίως εἶχον, and that being\r\nMerchants, they conveyed the _Indian_ and _Arabian_ Commodities by\r\nthe way of _Persia_ into the _Roman_ Territories; though the true\r\nreason were their Riches: But the _Palmyrenes_ being informed of the\r\nDesign, took care to prevent them, and so escaped Plunder: And this\r\nAttempt of _Antony_'s occasioned a Rupture between the two Empires.\r\nThe Words of _Pliny_ (_lib._ 5. _Nat. Hist._) above an hundred Years\r\nafter, do likewise testifie that this City then continued in the same\r\nEnjoyment of their Liberties. They being very much to the purpose, I\r\nthought fit to Copy them: _Palmyra Urbs nobilis situ, divitiis soli\r\natque aquis amœnis, vasto undique ambitu arinis includit agros, ac\r\nvelut terris exempta à rerum Natura; privata sorte inter duo imperia\r\nsumma Romanorum Parthorumque, & prima in discordia semper utrinque\r\ncura_. Whereby it appears not only that it was a Common-wealth in the\r\ntime of _Vespasian_; but the situation thereof is truly described, as\r\nit were an Island of fertile Land, surrounded with a Sea of barren\r\nSands. Such Spots _Strabo_ tells us were frequent in _Lybia_, and by\r\nthe _Egyptians_ were called _Abases_; whence possibly the Name of the\r\n_Abassyne_ Nation is derived.\r\n\r\nWith these Advantages of Freedom, Neutrality and Trade, for near two\r\nCenturies, 'tis not strange that it acquired the State and Wealth\r\nanswerable to the Magnificence of these noble Structures. But when\r\nthe _Romans_ under _Trajan_ had made it appear, that there was\r\nno comparison between the Puissance of the _Parthians_ and them,\r\n(_Trajan_ having taken _Babylon_ and _Ctesiphon_ the then Seat of\r\nthe _Parthian_ Empire,) the _Palmyreni_ were at length determined to\r\nDeclare for the _Romans_; which they did, by submitting themselves to\r\nthe Emperor _Adrian_, about the Year of Christ 130, when _Adrian_\r\nmade his Progress through _Syria_ into _Egypt_. And that Magnificent\r\nEmperor being highly delighted with the native Strength and Situation\r\nof the Place, was pleased to adorn and rebuild it: When, as 'tis\r\nlikely, he bestowed on it the Privileges of a Colony _Juris Italici_,\r\nwhich it enjoyed (as _Ulpian_ assures us.) And the Inhabitants of the\r\nCity, in Gratitude, were willing to call themselves _Hadrianopolitæ_,\r\nἐπικτισθείσης τῆς πόλεως ὑπὸ τοῦ Αὐτοκράτορος (says _Stephanus_.) Nor\r\nis it unlikely that many of those Marble Pillars were the Gift of that\r\nEmperor, and particularly those of the Long _Porticus_; for that none\r\nof the Inscriptions are before that Date. And it was usual for the\r\n_Cæsars_ to present Cities that had obliged them, with Marble Pillars\r\nto adorn their Publick Buildings. These here were not far to fetch, the\r\nNeighbouring Mountains affording _Marble-Quarries_: But the Magnitude\r\nof the _Porphyry_ Columns is indeed very remarkable, considering\r\nhow far those vast Stones must have been brought by Land-carriage\r\nto this Place; it being not known that any other Quarries yield it,\r\nexcept those of _Egypt_, which lie about mid-way between _Cairo_ and\r\n_Siena_, between the _Nile_ and the _Red-Sea_: The Stone being very\r\nvaluable for its Colour and Hardness, and so that it rises in Blocks\r\nof any magnitude required; _Quantislibet molibus cædendis sufficiunt\r\nLapidicinæ_, (_Plin._ _lib._ 36.) And it is a great mistake of those\r\nwho suppose it fictitious.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of _Adrian_ to that of _Aurelian_, for about an hundred\r\nand forty Years, this City continued to flourish and encrease in\r\nWealth and Power, to that degree, that when the Emperor _Valerian_ was\r\ntaken Prisoner by _Sapores_ King of _Persia_, _Odænathus_ one of the\r\nLords of this Town (which Name occurs in several of these Inscriptions)\r\nwas able (whilst _Gallienus_ neglected his Duty both to his Father\r\nand Country) to bring a powerful Army into the Field, and to recover\r\n_Mesopotamia_ from the _Persians_, and to penetrate as far as their\r\nCapital City _Ctesiphon_. Thereby rendring so considerable Service to\r\nthe _Roman_ State, that _Gallienus_ thought himself obliged to give\r\nhim a share in the Empire: Of which Action, _Trebellius Pollio_ (in\r\nthe Life of _Gallienus_) has these Words, _Laudatur ejus (Gallieni)\r\noptimum factum, qui, Odenatum participato Imperio Augustum vocavit,\r\nejusque monetam, qua Persas captos traheret, cudi jussit: quod &\r\nSenatus & Urbs & omnis ætas gratanter accepit_. The same in many\r\nPlaces speaks of this _Odænathus_ with great Respect; and mentioning\r\nhis Death, he says, _Iratum fuisse Deum Reip. credo, qui interfecto\r\nValeriano noluit Odenatum reservare_. But by a strange reverse of\r\nFortune, this Honour and Respect to _Odænathus_ occasioned the sudden\r\nRuin and Subversion of the City. For he and his Son _Herodes_ being\r\nmurder'd by _Mæonius_ their Kinsman, and dying with the Title of\r\n_Augustus_, his Wife _Zenobia_, in Right of her Son _Waballathus_ then\r\na Minor, pretended to take upon her the Government of the East, and\r\ndid administer it to admiration: And when soon after _Gallienus_ was\r\nmurder'd by his Soldiers, she grasped the Government of _Egypt_, and\r\nheld it during the short Reign of the Emperor _Claudius Gothicus_. But\r\n_Aurelian_ coming to the Imperial Dignity, would not suffer the Title\r\nof _Augustus_ in this Family, tho' he was contented that they should\r\nhold under him as _Vice Cæsaris_; as plainly appears by the Latin\r\nCoins of _Aurelian_ on the one side, and _Waballathus_ (which Name is\r\noften found in these Inscriptions) on the other, with these Letters\r\nV. C. R. IM. OR., which _P. Harduin_ has most judiciously interpreted\r\n_Vice Cæsaris Rector Imperii Orientis_, but without the Title of\r\n_Cæsar_ or _Augustus_, and with a Laurel instead of a Diadem. But both\r\n_Waballathus_ and _Zenobia_ are stiled ΣΕΒΑΣΤΟΙ in the _Greek_ Coins,\r\nmade, 'tis probable, within their own Jurisdiction. Two of the _Latin_\r\nI have seen, and they are as described, excepting the Points.\r\n\r\nBut nothing less than a Participation of the Empire contenting\r\n_Zenobia_, and _Aurelian_ persisting not to have it dismembered: He\r\nmarched against her, and having in two Battles routed her Forces, he\r\nshut her up and Besieged her in _Palmyra_: And the Besieged finding\r\nthat the great resistance they made, availed not against that resolute\r\nEmperor, they yielded the Town; and _Zenobia_ flying with her Son,\r\nwas pursued and taken: With which _Aurelian_ being contented, spared\r\nthe City, and leaving a small Garrison, march'd for _Rome_ with this\r\nCaptive Lady: But the Inhabitants believing he would not return, set up\r\nagain for themselves, and (as _Vopiscus_ has it) slew the Garrison he\r\nhad left in the Place. Which _Aurelian_ understanding, tho' by this\r\ntime he was gotten into _Europe_, with his usual fierceness, speedily\r\nreturned; and collecting a sufficient Army by the way, he again took\r\nthe City without any great Opposition, and put it to the Sword, with\r\nan uncommon Cruelty, as he himself confesses in a Letter (extant in\r\n_Vopiscus_), and delivered them to the Pillage of his Soldiers. And\r\nit is observable, that none of the Greek Inscriptions are after the\r\ndate of this Calamity, which befell the City in or about the Year of\r\n_Christ_ 272, as far as may be collected, after it had been nine or ten\r\nYears the Seat of the Empire of the East, not without Glory.\r\n\r\nIn this appears also the great utility of Coins to illustrate Matters\r\nof History; for by them alone 'tis made out, that there was such a\r\nPrince as _Waballathus_, _Vopiscus_ singly mentioning him by the Name\r\nof _Balbatus_. And from the same Coins it appears, that _Odænathus_ had\r\nthe Title of _Augustus_ four Years, and _Waballathus_ six at least;\r\nand that the first Year of _Aurelian_ was the fourth of _Waballathus_.\r\nAnd by the Testimony of _Pollio_, _Odænathus_ was declared Emperor\r\nof the East, _Gallieno_ & _Saturnino Coss._ which was _Anno Christi_\r\n263, and died before _Gallienus_, but in the same Year, _viz._ _Anno_\r\n267, which, by the Coins, was the first of _Waballathus_. He therefore\r\nimmediately succeeded _Odænathus_, and was without doubt his Eldest\r\nSon by _Zenobia_, and not his Grandson the Son of _Herodes_, as some\r\nlearned Men have supposed: For if _Zenobia_ could not endure that\r\n_Herodes_ Son of _Odænathus_ by a former Wife, should succeed his\r\nFather in prejudice to her Children, and for that reason was consenting\r\nto his Murther (as _Pollio_ intimates in _Herodes_ and _Mæonius_,) much\r\nless would she endure the Title of _Augustus_ in the Son of _Herodes_,\r\nespecially when her own Sons were, as 'tis probable, elder than such\r\nGrandson. So that 'tis most likely that _Herennianus_ and _Timolaus_,\r\nwhom _Pollio_ reckons among his XXX Tyrants, might be the Younger Sons\r\nof _Zenobia_, on whom also, out of Motherly Affection, she might bestow\r\nthe same Titles of Honour.\r\n\r\nBut it must be observed, that in the Greek Coins, this Prince's Name\r\nis usually written ΑΥΤ. ΕΡΜΙΑΣ ΟΥΑΒΑΛΛΑΘΟΣ ΑΘΗΝΟΥ (as _Tristan_ says\r\nhe found it upon several Medals,) but _Patin_ has the last Word only\r\nΑΘΗ. I should be glad to peruse some of these curious Coins, especially\r\nif found in or near _Palmyra_: but I am inclinable to believe that his\r\ntrue Name was _Æranes Waballathus_ (as was one of his Progenitors, in\r\nInscription _Pag._ 91.) though perhaps the remoter Cities of _Asia_ and\r\n_Ionia_ might by mistake write it _Hermias_. And 'tis probable that\r\nΑΘΗΝ might be for the first Letters of the Name of ΟΔΗΝΑΘΟΣ, which in\r\nSyriack begun with an _Aleph_; and the Δ was with those People used\r\ninstead of Θ, as we see the Month _Xanthicus_, written Ξανδικὸς in many\r\nof these Inscriptions, which doubtless was pronounced like D _blæsum_\r\nor the Saxon D.\r\n\r\nThough this City were at that time so roughly treated by _Aurelian_,\r\nyet it is certain that he did not burn it, or destroy the Buildings\r\nthereof: And though _Zosimus_, on this occasion, uses the Words τὴν\r\nπόλιν κατασκάψας, yet that seems only to relate to his demolishing the\r\nWalls and Defences of the Place; and that Emperors own Letter extant\r\nin _Vopiscus_, doth sufficiently shew that he spared the City it self,\r\nand that he took care to re-instate the beautiful Temple of the _Sun_\r\nthat was there, which had been Plundered by his Soldiers. However,\r\nthe Damage then sustained was never retrieved by the Inhabitants, and\r\nI do not find that ever this City made any figure in History after\r\nit: Yet the _Latin Inscription_, (Pag. 106.) seems to intimate, as\r\nif _Dioclesian_ had restored their Walls within thirty Years after.\r\nAbout the Year of Christ 400, it was the Head Quarters of the _Legio\r\nPrima Illyricorum_; and though _Stephanus_ gives it no better Title\r\nthan φρούριον, yet it appears to have been an Archbishop's See,\r\nunder the Metropolitan of _Damascus_. To say in what Age, or from\r\nwhat Hand it received its final Overthrow, which reduced it to the\r\nmiserable Condition it now appears in, there is no light in any of our\r\nHistorians; but it is probable it perish'd long since, in the obscure\r\nAges of the World, during the Wars of the _Saracen_ Empire; and being\r\nburnt and desolated, it was never rebuilt; which occasions the Ruins\r\nto lie so entire, in a manner as they were left, neither being used to\r\nother Structures on the Place, nor worth carrying away, because of the\r\ngreat distance thereof from any other City.\r\n\r\nAs to the Geographical Site of _Palmyra_, _Ptolemy_ places it in the\r\nLatitude of _Tripoly_ on the Coast of _Syria_, and four Degrees more\r\nEasterly, _viz._\r\n\r\n                          Παλμύρα. οα, ϛ′. λδ.\r\n\r\nand he makes it the Capital of sixteen Cities in _Syria Palmyrena_,\r\nwhereof _Alalis_, _Danaba_ and _Evaria_ were afterwards _Bishops Sees_.\r\n_Pliny_ places it CCIII Miles from the nearest Coast of _Syria_, and\r\nCCCXXXVII from _Seleucia ad Tygrim_ near _Bagdat_, (which Numbers are\r\nerroneously Printed 252 and 537 in most Editions, contrary to the\r\nAuthority of the MSS.) _Josephus_ places it one Days Journey from\r\n_Euphrates_, and six from _Babylon_; which must be understood of\r\nHorse-man's Journeys of about sixty Miles _per diem_, it being more\r\nthan so much from this City to _Euphrates_. _Ptolemy_ also mentions a\r\nRiver running by _Palmyra_, which did not appear to our Travellers,\r\nunless that Gut or Channel wherein they were overflowed by the\r\nRain-Waters, were the Bed thereof; which may, possibly, run with a\r\nconstant Stream in the Winter or times of much Rain: But this (as the\r\nRivers of _Aleppo_ and _Damascus_ at this Day) is made by _Ptolomy_ to\r\nhave no _exit_; but to go off in _Vapour_, and to be imbibed by the\r\nthirsty Earth of these Desarts.\r\n\r\nThe _Æra_ or Accompt of Years observed by the _Palmyreni_ in these\r\nInscriptions, is evidently that of _Seleucus_, call'd afterwards\r\n_Dhilcarnian_ or _Bicornis_ by the _Arabians_, and by them kept in use\r\ntill above 900 Years of Christ (as appears by the Observations of\r\n_Albatani_, published in _Numb._ 204 of the _Philosoph. Transact._) and\r\nnot that of the Death of _Alexander_. This may be demonstrated from\r\nthe Inscription (_Pag. 101._) wherein _Alexander Severus_ is stiled\r\nΘΕΟΣ; that is, after the Death and Consecration of that Emperor, or\r\nafter the Year of our Lord 234; and from the Name of _Julius_, who,\r\nwhen this Inscription was put up, was _Præfectus Prætorio_, (and could\r\nbe no other than _Julius Philippus Arabs_ who might be esteemed by the\r\n_Palmyreni_ as their Country-man,) it follows, that it was in the last\r\nYear of _Gordian_ _Anno Christi_ 242 or 243: And that Emperor being\r\nsoon after Murder'd by the Treachery of this _Philip_, who succeeded\r\nhim: And his Treason coming afterwards to light, 'tis not strange that\r\nhis Name was purposely effaced in this Inscription. The Date thereof,\r\n_Anno_ 554, shews the beginning of this Accompt 311 or 312 Years before\r\nChrist, co-incident with the _Æra_ of _Seleucus_, which was likewise\r\nobserved by several other Cities in the East.\r\n\r\nI shall not undertake the part of a Critick on these Inscriptions, but\r\nchuse rather to leave them to the more professedly skilful in that part\r\nof Learning, and shall only make some few Remarks on them, such as\r\noccurred whilst they pass'd through my Hands.\r\n\r\n1. That the more ancient of these Inscriptions dated before the Year\r\n500, do no where make use of _Roman Prænomina_, which yet are very\r\nfrequent in them that follow; particularly _Julius_, _Aurelius_ and\r\n_Septimius_, taken up by these People out of Respect to the Emperors\r\nthat bore those Names; and consequently that _Septimius Odænathus_ (the\r\nInscription of whose Tomb we have, _pag. 91._) was most probably the\r\nsame who was afterwards _Augustus_. That Name growing in use in the\r\nReign of _Septimius Severus_, under whom or his Son _Caracalla_ this\r\n_Odænathus_ was certainly Born. And this Monument being erected by\r\nhim whilst he was yet a private Man; and he afterwards attaining the\r\nImperial Dignity, it was necessary the Inscription of his Tomb (which\r\nperhaps was that single one that was all of Marble) should be changed:\r\nUpon which occasion this Stone might be brought back into the Town, and\r\nafter its Destruction, be clapt up casually over the little Gate-way\r\nwhere now it stands.\r\n\r\n2. _Pag. 100._ ΚΑΤΕΛΘΟΝΤΕΣ ΕΙΣ ΟΛΟΓΕΣΙΑΔΑ ΕΝΠΟΡΟΙΑΝ ΕΣΤΗΣΑΝ:\r\n_Descendentes Vologesiada Commercium stabiliverunt, Anno_ 558, _sive\r\nAnno Christi_ 247. Whereby it appears, that this People having had\r\ntheir Trade interrupted by the Wars between the _Romans_ and the\r\n_Persians_, under _Gordian_; did now send an Embassy to the Court of\r\n_Sapores_ King of the _Persians_, to get it re-established; which\r\nsucceeded according to their Desires. _Vologesias_ was a City built\r\nby _Vologeses_ King of the _Parthians_ in the time of _Nero_, on\r\nthe _Euphrates_ below _Babylon_. _Ptolemy_ calls it Οὐολογεσιάς;\r\n_Stephanus_, Βολογεσιὰς; _Ammianus_ _Vologessia_; and _Pliny_ lib. 6.\r\n_Vologesocirta_.\r\n\r\n3. _Pag. 101._ ΚΑΙ ΟΥΚΟΝΙΣΩΝΑ ΦΕΙΔΗΣΑΝΤΑ ΧΡΗΜΑΤΩΝ. I submit it to the\r\nJudgment of the Criticks, whether this faulty Place may not be amended\r\nby reading it ΟΥΚ ΟΙΚΕΙΩΝ ΑΦΕΙΔΗΣΑΝΤΑ, _&c._ as likewise whether\r\nΔΙΣΜΑΛΚΟΥ in the same Inscription may not be instead of ΜΑΛΛΟΥ ΤΟΥ\r\nΜΑΛΚΟΥ, which is the Ingenious Conjecture of that excellent Grammarian\r\nMr. _William Baxter_.\r\n\r\n4. _Pag. 102._ _Septimium Vorodem Procuratorem Ducenarium Augusti &_\r\nΑΡΟΑΠΕΤΗΝ. This Word, if _Greek_, is faultily transcribed; and in\r\none Copy I have seen, the Ο is very small, as I suppose it on the\r\nStone, which might occasion the transcribing thereof without it in\r\nthe former Voyage (_Pag. 130._) So that 'tis most probable that 'tis\r\nthe remains of some other Letter almost worn out. I conjecture it to\r\nhave been ΑΡΤΑΓΕΤΗΝ, Π being taken for Γ, and that this _Septimius_\r\nwas _Præfectus Annonæ_, having the Care to see that the City were\r\nsufficiently provided with Bread; which was a most necessary Officer\r\nin a Place that must needs be furnish'd with Corn from Abroad. And\r\nthis same _Septimius_, (in the Inscription, _Pag. 105._) is\r\nstiled .... ΕΟΔΟΤΗΝ ΤΗΣ ΜΗΤΡΟΚΟΛΩΝΕΙΑΣ. _lege_ ΚΡΕΟΔΟΤΗΝ, which should\r\nsignifie that he was the Distributor of the Emperor's Munificence in\r\nFlesh to the People. These Inscriptions bear Date in _April_, _Anno\r\nDom._ 267. not long before the Death of _Odænathus_, who is herein\r\nstiled ΣΕΒΑΣΤΟΣ: and 'tis not improbable but he might institute such\r\na Custom, as at the Publick Charge, to give the People a Largess in\r\nFlesh on particular Days, to reconcile them to the Dominion of their\r\nFellow-Citizen. This is certain, that _Aurelian_ first instituted such\r\na Custom of giving Flesh at _Rome_: The Words of _Vopiscus_ are, _Idem\r\nAurelianus & porcinam carnem populo Romano distribuit, quæ hodieque\r\ndividitur_; which Custom continued till the time of _Constantine_,\r\nwhen (according to _Zosimus_) one _Lucian_, who had this Office of\r\ndistributing Swines Flesh at _Rome_, had Interest enough among the\r\nPeople to set up _Maxentius_ for Emperor; and _Salmasius_ assures us,\r\nthat it was not discontinued till the time of _Heraclius_. It will not\r\ntherefore seem strange, if I suppose _Aurelian_ might find that Custom\r\nat _Palmyra_, and at his return from thence institute the like at\r\n_Rome_.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to believe, that not only those two Inscriptions, _Pag.\r\n102_, and the last of _Pag. 103_, but also that of _Pag. 106_, were\r\nin Honour of the same _Septimius Vorodes_ who seems to have been a\r\ngreat Favourite of _Odænathus_, and was without doubt respected by\r\nthe _Romans_ on that account, whom I conclude to have effaced all the\r\nMemorials of _Zenobia_ and _Waballathus_, insomuch that no one appears,\r\namong those many taken, that was set up during the six Years they\r\nreigned. The Name _Vorodes_ seems the same with _Orodes_, which was\r\nthe Name of the King of the _Parthians_ that slew _Crassus_: and the\r\n_Persians_ having, about forty Years before, expelled the Race of the\r\n_Arsacidæ_, 'tis not improbable but the Remains of that Royal Family\r\nmight fly for Succour to _Palmyra_, and this _Vorodes_ might be one of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n5. In two other Copies of these Inscriptions; the first of _pag. 104._\r\nis read, Σεπτίμιον Αἰράνην Ὀδαινάθου, and not Ὀδαινόθου as in the\r\nfirst Copy, and perhaps ought rather to be Ὀδαίναθον, as being the\r\nInscription under a Statue of the same _Odænathus_, who is here, as\r\nwell as on his Tomb, stiled _Illustrissimus Patricius_, but without a\r\nDate.\r\n\r\n6. ΥΠΟ ΙΑΡΙΒΩΛΟΥ ΘΕΟΥ (_pag. 101._ & 109.) It cannot well be doubted\r\nbut that this _Deus Jaribolus_ is the same with what _Gruter_ (_pag._\r\n86.) and _Spon_ (in the first of his Inscriptions) reads ΑΓΛΙΒΩΛΩ.\r\nBy the Figure of the Idol extant in _Spon_, it appears that this God\r\nwas made with the Moon upon his Shoulders, and consequently was the\r\n_Deus Lunus_ worshipped by the _Syrians_, whose Name, in the Language\r\nof that Country, could not be better expressed than by _Jarehbol_ ירה\r\nביעל _Dominus Lunus_. Whence I am induced to believe, that _Gruter_\r\nmistook it ΑΓΛΙΒΩΛΩ for ΑΓΑΙΒΩΛΩ, the Ι in the beginning, and the lower\r\npart of the round stroke of the Ρ, being effaced, so as to pass for Γ.\r\nI have taken care to have the Stone purposely viewed, as also to get\r\nfrom thence the exact Figure of the _Syrian_ or _Palmyrene_ Characters\r\nthereon, wherein there is an irreconcilable difference between _Spon_\r\nand _Gruter_. By the help of these, compared with two others taken\r\nat _Palmyra_, which I have by me, (they being all very near the same\r\nDate,) I hope we may be able, one Day, to make out the _Palmyrene_\r\nAlphabet: But it were to be wish'd our Travellers had transcribed them\r\nwith more Curiosity, and taken more of them.\r\n\r\nBy the way, it is remarkable, that the Person who dedicated this\r\nMonument, in _Gruter_ and _Spon_, is stiled Λ. ΑΥΡ. ΗΛΙΟΔΩΡΟΣ: and the\r\nsame Name occurs in a broken Inscription which Mr. _Hallifax_ omitted\r\nin his Letter to Dr. _Bernard_, as being too imperfect. It stood on the\r\nright Hand of the entrance to the little Temple described _pag. 110._\r\nand was thus,\r\n\r\nΛΟΥΚΙΟΥ ΑΥΡΗ[ΛΙ]ΟΥ ..... ΗΛΙΟΔΩΡΟΥ ΤΟΥ.\r\n\r\nAnd after a Blank of three lines all worn out except one single Ο,\r\nthere followed,\r\n\r\n[ΤΕΙ]ΜΗΣ ΧΑΡΙΝ ΕΤΟΥΣ....... ΜΗΝΟΣ [ΑΠ]ΕΛΛΑΙ[ΟΥ]. And that imperfect one\r\nin _pag. 104._ seems to have relation to the same Name.\r\n\r\n7. _Pag. 111._ ΜΑΛΕΝΤΟΝ ΚΑΙ ΑΓΡΙΠΠΑΝ _lege_ ΜΑΛΗΝ ΤΟΝ ΚΑΙ ΑΓΡΙΠΠΑΝ, it\r\nbeing written ΜΑΛΗΝΤΟΝ, with Η in the two other Copies I have seen,\r\nwhereby the Sence is cleared.\r\n\r\n8. _Pag. 117._ ΑΓΑΘΑΝΓΕΛΟΣ ΑΒΙΛΗΝΟΣ ΤΗΣ ΔΕΚΑΠΟΛΕΟΣ, _Agathangelus\r\nAbilenus, Decapolitanus, Patronymice_. There were in these Parts two\r\nCities known by the Name of _Abila_; to distinguish which, the one was\r\ncalled _Abila Lysaniæ_, from the Name of the Tetrarch: St. _Luke_, ch.\r\n3. 1. and is placed by _Ptolemy_ (in his _Cælosyria_) about mid-way\r\nbetween _Damascus_ and _Heliopolis_: The other in _Judæa_, called\r\n_Abila ad Jordanem_, described by _Josephus_ in many Places, to lie\r\nover-against _Jericho_, near the _Dead-Sea_. _Decapolis_ was so called\r\nfrom its Ten Cities, enumerated by _Pliny_ (_lib._ 5. 18.) And with\r\nthem he reckons up, among others, the _Tetrarchy_ of _Abila_, in the\r\nsame _Decapolis_: Which demonstrates the _Abila Decapolis_ and _Abila\r\nLysaniæ_ to be the same Place. And tho' it cannot be denied, but\r\nthat some of _Pliny_'s Ten Cities are not far distant from that near\r\n_Jordan_; yet it doth not appear that ever this other had the Title\r\nof a _Tetrarchy_. Here it is to be observed, that what _Pliny_ calls\r\n_Decapolis_, _Ptolemy_ makes his _Cæle Syria_; and the _Cæle Syria_\r\nof _Pliny_, is that part of _Syria_ about _Aleppo_, formerly call'd\r\n_Chalcidene_, _Cyrrhistice_, &c.\r\n\r\nWhat this Town of _Teibe_ was anciently call'd, is not so easily\r\nconjectured: But if the Numbers of _Ptolemy_ may be confided in, it is\r\nvery near the Situation of a City he calls _Oriza_; and perhaps his\r\n_Adada_ may be our _Soukney_, and his _Rhæsapha_ what is now called\r\n_Arsoffa_.\r\n\r\nIt is taken for granted, that Old _Aleppo_ was anciently the City of\r\n_Berrhæa_, and there wants not ancient Testimony to prove it; which\r\nbeing granted, I think I may without scruple conclude, that _Andrene_\r\n(_pag. 122._ and 133.) is the Ruins of the City of _Androna_; and\r\n_Esree_ (_pag. 135._) that of _Seriane_, both mentioned in the\r\nItinerary of _Antoninus_, in the Journey _à Dolicâ Seriane_. But this\r\nwhole Country is laid about half a Degree more Southerly than it\r\nought, by _Ptolemy_, who places _Berrhæa_ in Lat. 36 _deg._ For the\r\nMeridian Altitude of the Tropical Sun at _Aleppo_ is found there but\r\n77 _deg._ whence the Latitude 36 _deg._ 30 _min._ as it was observed,\r\n_Anno_ 1680. by three several Quadrants, in the presence of a curious\r\nGentleman, to whom I am obliged for this Communication.\r\n\r\nBy the same Observation a much greater Error is amended in the\r\nLatitude of _Aleppo_, in the _Rudolfine_ Tables of _Kepler_, who\r\nsupposes _Aleppo_ to have been the ancient _Antiochia ad Taurum_, and\r\naccordingly places it Lat. 37. _deg._ 20 _min._ wherein he is followed\r\nby _Bullialdus_ and others; and several Maps have copied the Mistake.\r\nBut a much greater use of it is, that thereby we are assured, that the\r\nCity of _Aracta_, wherein _Albatani_ made the Observations we have\r\nPublish'd in the _Philosoph. Transact. Numb._ 204. was, without doubt,\r\nthe same which is now called _Racca_ on the _Euphrates_; of which Town\r\nan Account may be seen in _Rauwolf_'s Voyages, and which was not many\r\nMiles below the Place where our Travellers first came on the River:\r\nAnd if _Arecca_, in the Language of this Country, relates to Victory\r\n(as is said in _pag. 143._) it was, doubtless, anciently the City\r\n_Nicephorion_, built by _Alexander_ the Great; with which the Situation\r\nexactly agrees. The Latitude thereof was observed by that _Albatani_\r\nwith great accurateness, about eight hundred Years since; and therefore\r\nI recommended it to all that are curious of such Matters, to endeavour\r\nto get some good Observation made at this Place, to determine the\r\nHeight of the Pole there, thereby to decide the Controversie, whether\r\nthere hath really been any Change in the Axis of the Earth, in so long\r\nan Interval; which some great Authors of late, have been willing to\r\nsuppose. And if any curious Traveller, or Merchant residing there,\r\nwould please to observe, with due care, the Phases of the Moons\r\nEclipses at _Bagdat_, _Aleppo_ and _Alexandria_, thereby to determin\r\ntheir Longitudes, they could not do the Science of Astronomy a greater\r\nService: For in and near these Places were made all the Observations\r\nwhereby the middle Motions of the Sun and Moon are limited: And I could\r\nthen pronounce in what Proportion the Moon's Motion does Accelerate;\r\nwhich that it does, I think I can demonstrate, and shall (God willing)\r\none Day, make it appear to the Publick.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Philosophical Reader_ is desired to excuse our breaking in upon\r\nthe Subject of these Tracts, by intermixing Historical and Philological\r\nMatters, as also our exceeding the Bounds of an Extract: But we hope\r\nthe Curiosity of the Subject, joyned to the Desires of the _Royal\r\nSociety_, may make an easie Apology suffice. There may be many other\r\nInstructive Remarks made thereon, which still deserve the Consideration\r\nof the Learned, and from such the Publick may yet expect a further\r\nAccount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _A Voyage of the Emperour of _China_ into the Eastern _Tartary_,\r\n    Anno. 1682._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Emperour of _China_ made a Voyage into Eastern _Tartary_, in the\r\nbeginning of this Year 1682, after having appeased (by the Death of\r\nthree Rebellious Kings) a Revolt, formed in some Provinces of the\r\nEmpire: One of those revolted Princes, was Strangled in the Province,\r\nof which he had made himself Master: The second being brought to\r\n_Pekin_ with the Principal Heads of his Faction, was cut in Pieces\r\nin the sight of the whole Court: The most Considerable among the\r\n_Mandarines_, acting with their own hands in this sad Execution, to\r\nRevenge upon this Rebel the Death of their Parents, which he had caused\r\nto be Cruelly Murdered.\r\n\r\nThe third which was the most Considerable, (and indeed the Chief of all\r\nthe Revolt) had by a voluntary Death prevented his deserved Punishment,\r\nand so put an end to a War, which had lasted for Seven Years.\r\n\r\nThe Peace having been settled, by the Re-establishing in the Empire and\r\nall the Provinces, the Peaceable Enjoyment of their Ancient Liberties:\r\nThe Emperour departed the 23_d._ of _March_ to go into the Province of\r\n_Leao-tum_, the Country of his Ancestors, with a Design of visiting\r\ntheir Sepulchers, and (after having honoured them with the usual\r\nCeremonies) of prosecuting his Journey into the Eastern _Tartary_: This\r\nJourney was was about 1100 _miles_, from _Pekin_ to the end of it.\r\n\r\nThe Emperour took with him his eldest Son, a young Prince of ten\r\nyears old, which had already been declared Heir of the Empire: The\r\nthree principal Queens went also in this Journy, each in their\r\ngilded Chariot; the principal Kings also which compose this Empire,\r\nwere accompanying with all the Grandees of the Court: And the most\r\nconsiderable _Mandarines_ of all the Orders, who having all a very\r\ngreat Train of Attendants, and very numerous Equipage, made a Court\r\nabout the Emperour of more then 70000 Persons.\r\n\r\nIt was his Will that I should accompany him in this Journey, and that\r\nI should be always near him, to the end I might make in his Presence,\r\nthe Observations, necessary for knowing the disposition of the Heavens,\r\nthe elevation of the Pole, the Magnetical Declinations of every Place,\r\nand for Measuring with Mathematical Instruments the height of the\r\nMountains, and the distances of Places: He was well pleased also to\r\nbe informed of what concerned Meteors, and many other Physical and\r\nMathematical Matters.\r\n\r\nIn so much, that he gave Order to an Officer to carry upon Horses such\r\nInstruments as I should have occasion to make use of, and recommended\r\nme to the Prince his Unkle, who is also his Father in Law, and the\r\nsecond Person of the State, he is called by a _Chinese_ Name, which\r\nsignifies an Associate of the Empire: He gave charge to him to cause\r\nall things to be provided for me which were necessary for this Journey,\r\nwhich this Prince performed with a very particular goodness, causing me\r\nto Lodge always in his own Tent, and to eat at his Table.\r\n\r\nThe Emperour ordered that they should give me Horses of his own\r\nStables, to the End I might the more easily Change in Riding, and\r\nsome of those were of them He Himself had Rid, which is a Mark of\r\nvery extraordinary distinction. In this Journey we always went toward\r\nthe North-east: From _Pekin_ to the Province of _Leao-tum_, the Way\r\nbeing about 300 Miles is pretty equal: In the Province it self of\r\n_Leao-tum_, it is about 400 Miles, but much more unequal by Reason of\r\nthe Mountains; from the Frontier of this Province to the City of _La_,\r\nor the River which the _Tartars_ call _Songoro_, and the _Chinoise_\r\n_Sumhoa_, the way (which is about 400 Miles) is very difficult, being\r\ncrossed sometimes by Mountains extreamly Steep, sometimes by Valleys\r\nof extraordinary Depth, and through Desert Plains, wherein for two or\r\nthree Days March we met with nothing. The Mountains of this Country are\r\nCovered on the East side with great Oaks and old Forrests, which have\r\nnot been cut for some Ages.\r\n\r\nAll the Country which is beyond the Province of _Leao-tum_ is exceeding\r\nDesert where nothing is to be seen on all sides but Mountains and\r\nValleys, and Dens of _Bears_, _Tigers_ and other _Devouring_ Beasts,\r\nyou can scarce find a House, but only some _poor Reed Huts_, upon the\r\nsides of some Brooks and Streams. All the Cities and _Burrow-towns_\r\nwhich I have seen in the Province of _Leao-tum_, and which are in very\r\ngreat Numbers are intirely ruined: One can see nothing thro' the whole\r\nCountry, but old ruined Walls with Rubble, Bricks and Stones. In the\r\nout-skirts of these Cities there have been of late some few Houses\r\nbuilt, but without any order. Some of them made of Earth, others of the\r\nRubbish of the old Buildings, the most part of them covered with Straw\r\nor Thatch, and but few with Tiles. There is now not the least Footsteps\r\nremaining of a great number of Towns and Villages which were here\r\nbefore the War. Because the petty King of the _Tartars_, who began to\r\nkindle this War having but a very small Army, caused the Inhabitants of\r\nthose Places to take Arms, which Places he forthwith destroyed, that he\r\nmight take from his Soldiers the hopes of ever returning again to their\r\nown _Homes_.\r\n\r\nThe Capital City of _Leao-tum_, which is called _Xyn-Yam_, is a City\r\nvery fair and pretty intire, it has as yet the Remains of an Antient\r\n_Palace_. It is (for as much as I was able to remark by divers\r\nObservations) of the Latitude of 41 _degrees_ 56 _minutes_; that is to\r\nsay, two _degrees_ above _Pekin_, tho' hitherto both the _Europeans_\r\nand the _Chinese_ have given that City the Latitude of 41 _degrees_.\r\nThere is in that City no declination of the Magnetick Needle, as I have\r\nfound by many reiterated Observations. The City of _Ula_ which was\r\nalmost the very Extream of our Journey, lies in 44 _degrees_ and 20\r\n_minutes_. The compass there declines from the South to the West one\r\n_degree_ 40 _minutes_.\r\n\r\nBut to resume the Prosecution of our Journey, from _Pekin_ to this\r\nExtream towards the East there is made a new Way, by which the Emperour\r\ncan commodiously March with his Horse, and the Queens in their\r\nChariots. This Way is about 10 _foot_ broad, and as even and streight\r\nas could possibly be made; it is extended above 1000 _Miles_, it has a\r\nlittle Raising on each side of about a Foot high every where equal and\r\nperfectly Parallel to one another; and this Way was as neat, especially\r\nwhen the Weather was fair, as a Floor where the Husbandmen beat out\r\ntheir Corn in the Field; there were also certain Persons along this\r\nway, who only took care to Smooth and Cleanse it. The Christians have\r\nno where so great care of Sweeping their Streets and publick Places\r\nwhere the Holy Sacrament is to pass in the Processions, as these\r\nInfidels have of cleansing the Ways, where their Kings and their Queens\r\nare to pass, every time they go out of their Palaces.\r\n\r\nThere was made for their Return a way like the former, they plained or\r\nlevelled the Mountains as far as they were able, they raised Bridges\r\nover the Rivers, and for ornamenting them, they had extended on each\r\nside of them a sort of Mats upon which they had Painted divers Figures\r\nof Animals, which had the same effect with Tapestry Hangings, with\r\nwhich the Streets are usually hung in Procession.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor did very seldom make use of this Way, being almost always\r\nin Hunting: And when he accompanied the Queens he only Rode by the\r\nside of it, to the End that the great number of Horse which were in the\r\nTrain that followed should not spoil it: He ordinarily Marched at the\r\nHead of this kind of Army. The Queens followed immediately in their\r\nChariots, with their Train and their Equipage; they notwithstanding\r\nleft some space between the King and themselves: After these Marched\r\nthe Kings, the Grandees of the Court and the _Mandarines_, every one\r\naccording to his Rank, behind these an infinity of Attendants, and\r\nother People on Horse-back brought up the Rear-guard.\r\n\r\nAs there was not one City upon all this Way, that could either Lodge\r\nso great a Multitude, or Furnish them with Provisions, and that the\r\ngreatest Part of their Journey was through a Country very little\r\nInhabited, so they were Necessitated to carry along with them all\r\nthings that were Necessary for the journey, and even Provisions of\r\nVictuals for three Months.\r\n\r\nUpon this Account there were sent before by the Ways which were made\r\non each side of the Emperors Way, an Infinity of Waggons, Cammels,\r\nHorses, and Mules for to carry the Baggage: Besides these the Emperor,\r\nthe Kings and almost all the Grandees of the Court, had great numbers\r\nof Horses led, for the use of changing from time to time. I do not here\r\nreckon the Droves of Beefs, Sheep, and other Cattel, which they were\r\nobliged to have with them. And though this great Multitude of Men,\r\nHorses, and Droves, passed by a way at a good distance from that of\r\nthe Emperor, yet it raised so horrible a Dust, that we always seemed to\r\nMarch in a cloud, and thence found it Difficult to distinguish those\r\nthat Marched 15 or 20 Paces from us.\r\n\r\nThe March was so well regulated, that this Army Incamped every Night\r\nupon the sides of some River or Brook. 'Twas for this Reason that they\r\ncaused the Tents and the Baggage necessary for this Incamping to set\r\nout very early in the Morning; and the Quarter-masters upon their first\r\narrival, Marked the Ground most proper for the placing of the Emperors\r\nTent, of the Queens, of the Kings, of the Grandees, of the Court, of\r\nthe _Mandarines_, each according to his Dignity, and according to the\r\nDignity he had in the _Chinese_ Militia, which is divided into eight\r\nOrders or into eight Standards.\r\n\r\nIn the space of three Months we passed about 1000 _Miles_, advancing\r\ntowards the North-east, and about as many in our return: In fine, we\r\narrived at _Kam-Hay_, which is a Fort situated between the South Sea\r\nand the Mountains of the North: It is there where is the beginning\r\nof that so much Celebrated Wall, and which separates the Province of\r\n_Leao-tum_ from that of _Pekely_; from whence it is extended very far\r\non the side of the North over the tops of the highest Mountains. When\r\nwe entred this Province, the Emperor, the Kings, and the Grandees of\r\nthe Court, quitted the great Way of which we have hitherto spoken, to\r\ntake that of the Mountains of the North, which are extended without\r\nInterruption towards the North-East: There some Days were passed in\r\nHunting, which was performed in this manner.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor chose 3000 Men of his Life-guard, Armed with Arrows and\r\nJavelins, and dispersed them some on this side some on that; so that\r\nthey possest themselves of a great Circuit about the Mountains, which\r\nthey Environed on all Parts, which made a kind of Circle whose Diameter\r\nwas at least 3000 _Paces_; then Marching to draw nearer together with\r\nequal Progress and without quitting their Range, what ever Obstacles\r\nthey found in the way (the Emperor having joyned with them several of\r\nthe Captains, and of the Grandees of the Court, for the better keeping\r\nof their Order) they Reduced this great Circle to another much less,\r\nwhich had about 300 _Paces_ in the Diameter: So that all the Beasts\r\nwhich had been stayed within the first, found themselves taken in\r\nthis last as in a Net: for that every one setting his Feet upon the\r\nGround, they Locked themselves together so closely, that they left\r\nno meshing Place for them to make their Escape by. Then they Pursued\r\nthem so Vigorously in this little Space, that the poor Creatures tired\r\nwith the violence of their Coursing, came and fell down at the Feet of\r\ntheir Chasers, and suffered themselves to be taken without trouble. I\r\nsaw taken in this Manner two or three Hundred Hares in less then one\r\nday, without counting an Infinite of Wolves and Foxes. I have seen\r\nthe same thing divers times done in that part of _Tartary_, which is\r\non the other side of the Province of _Leao-tum_, where I remember to\r\nhave seen, among others, more than 1000 Deer so pent up by these sort\r\nof Nets, which came to cast themselves into the Hands of the Hunters,\r\nhaving found no passage to save themselves by: they kill'd also Bears,\r\nBoars, and more than 60 Tigers, but these are taken by other means, and\r\nwith other Weapons.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor will'd that I should be present at all these different\r\nHuntings, and he recommended to his Father in Law, in a most obliging\r\nManner the having a particular care of me, and of giving charge that I\r\nshould not be exposed to any danger in the Hunting of the Tigers, and\r\nthe other fierce Beasts; I was the only Person of all the _Mandarines_\r\nwho was without Arms, and so near to the Emperor; though I made Light\r\nof the Fatigue during the time we were in our Journey, I found my self\r\nso wearied every Evening when I got to my Tent, that I was not able to\r\nsupport my Self; and I should have dispensed with my self divers times\r\nfrom following the Emperor, if my Friends had not counsel'd me to the\r\ncontrary, and if I had not fear'd that he would have taken it ill if he\r\nshould have perceived it.\r\n\r\nAfter having passed about 400 Miles in Hunting daily after this manner,\r\nwe arrived at last at _Xyn-Yam_, the Capital City of the Province,\r\nwhere we stayed four Days.\r\n\r\nThe Inhabitants of _Coree_ came to present to the Emperor a _Sea-Calf_\r\nwhich they had taken, the Emperor caused me to see it, and asked\r\nwhither our _European_ Books had spoken any thing of this Fish? I told\r\nhim we had a Book in our Library at _Pekin_ which had explain'd the\r\nNature of it, and dispatched presently a Courrier to our Fathers at\r\n_Pekin_, who brought it me in a few Days: The Emperor was pleased to\r\nsee that what was said of this Fish in this Book, was agreeable to this\r\nwhich he had seen, and caused it to be carried back again to _Pekin_ to\r\nbe carefully preserved.\r\n\r\nDuring the stay which we made in this City, the Emperor with the Queens\r\nwent to visit the Sepulchers of his Ancestors, which are not very far\r\ndistant, from whence he sent them back to _Xyn-Yam_, to continue his\r\nown Journey into the Eastern _Tartary_.\r\n\r\nAfter several Days of Marching and Hunting, he arrived at _Kirin_,\r\nwhich is distant from _Xyn-Yam_ 400 Miles: This City is built along\r\nthe great River _Songoro_ which takes its source from the Mountain\r\n_Cham-pe_, distant 400 Miles towards the South: This Mountain so\r\nFamous in the East for having been the Antient Seat of our _Tartars_,\r\nis always covered with Snow, from whence it had its Name, because\r\n_Cham-pe_ signifies the white Mountain.\r\n\r\nSo soon as the Emperor saw it, he alighted from his Horse and fell\r\non his Knees on the Bank of the River, and bowed Himself three times\r\nto the Ground to Salute it: After which, he caused himself to be\r\ncarried upon a glorious Throne of Gold, and so made his Entry into\r\nthe City: All the People ran in a throng before him, testifying by\r\ntheir Acclamations the Joy they had to see him. This Prince took great\r\nPleasure in those Testimonies of their Affection; and that he might\r\ngive them some Marks of his being very sensible of it, he was pleased\r\nto suffer himself to be seen by all, and forbid his Guards to hinder\r\nthe People from approaching him, as they used to do at _Pekin_.\r\n\r\nThey make in this City Barks of a very particular manner: The\r\nInhabitants keep always a great number of them ready fitted to Repulse\r\nthe _Muscovites_, who come often into this River, to dispute the\r\nFishing of Pearls. The Emperor reposed himself two Days, after which he\r\nDescended upon the River with some Lords, accompanied with more than\r\n100 Boats, till he arrived at the City of _Ula_, which is the fairest\r\nof all this Country, and which at other times hath been the Seat of the\r\nEmpire of the _Tartars_.\r\n\r\nA little below this City, which is at most about 32 _Miles_ from\r\n_Kirin_, the River is very full of a certain Fish which resemble near\r\nenough the Plaice of _Europe_: and 'twas principally for the taking the\r\nDivertisement of Fishing, that the Emperor went to _Ula_; but the Rains\r\ncoming on so suddainly, swelled the River so much, that all their Nets\r\nwere broken and carried away, by the great Flood of those Land Waters:\r\nThe Emperor notwithstanding stayed 5 or 6 Days at _Ula_; but seeing\r\nthe Rains were not at all discontinued, he was obliged to come back to\r\n_Kirin_, without having enjoyed the Pleasure of Fishing: as we ascended\r\nthe River, the Bark wherein I was with the Emperors Father in Law, was\r\nso indamaged by the agitation of the Waves, that we were constrained to\r\ngo a Shore, and mount a Chariot drawn by one Ox, which carried us very\r\nslowly to _Kirin_, the Rains not at all ceasing during our Journy.\r\n\r\nIn the Evening when the Emperor was entertained upon all these\r\nAdventures, he said Laughing, _the Fish have cheated us_; at length,\r\nafter we had stayed two Days at _Kirin_, the Rains began to diminish,\r\nand we retook our Way towards _Leao-tum_. I cannot here express the\r\nPains and Fatigues these had caused us to undergo, during the whole\r\nCourse of this Journy, by Reason of the Ways which the Rains had\r\nSpoiled, and rendred almost impassable: we went without staying over\r\nthe Mountains and over the Vallies, and we could not pass but with\r\nextream Danger, the Brooks and Rivers which were swelled by the Floods\r\nand Inundations which ran from all Parts: the Bridges were either\r\noverturned by the Violence of the Currents, or all covered by the great\r\noverflowing of the Waters. There were made in divers Places great\r\nCollections of Water, and of Mud, that it was almost impossible to be\r\ndrawn out of it. The Horses, Cammels, and other Beasts of Burthen,\r\nwhich carried the Baggage could not advance, but remained sticking\r\nin the Mud of the Marshes, or died of tiring upon the Ways. The Men\r\nwere not at all less incommoded, and all were enfeebled for want of\r\nVictuals, and of Refreshments necessary for so great a Journy: Many of\r\nthe Horsemen were obliged, either to lead their Horses on Foot, who\r\nwere no longer able to carry them, or to rest in the middle of the\r\nFields to suffer them to take Breath: And though the Quarter-masters\r\nand the Harbingers, spared not their Pains, nor for Wood (which they\r\ncut on all sides) to fill with Faggots all the bad Passages: Yet\r\nnotwithstanding after the Horses and Chariots, which took the Van early\r\nin the Morning had quite passed, it was impossible to pass after them:\r\nThe Emperor himself, with his Son, and all the great Lords of the\r\nCourt, were obliged more than once, to Foot it over the Mud and the\r\nMarshes, fearing to expose themselves to greater danger, if they should\r\nhave passed them on Horse-back.\r\n\r\nWhen they came to Bridges, or those other obstructions all the Army\r\nstayed: And as soon as the Emperor was passed, with some of the most\r\nconsiderable Persons, all the rest came together in a Throng, and every\r\none striving to pass first, many were tumbled over into the Water:\r\nOthers taking Ways more about, found them more dangerous, falling into\r\nSloughs and Bogs, out of which they could not Recover themselves. In\r\nfine, there were so many Inconveniencies to be met with, in all the\r\nWays of Eastern _Tartary_, that the old Officers who had followed the\r\nCourt above 30 _Years_, said they had never suffered so much in any\r\nJourny.\r\n\r\nIt was on those Occasions, that the Emperor more than once, gave me the\r\nMarks of a Respect altogether particular: the first Day that we put\r\nour Selves in the way for returning, we were stay'd in the Evening,\r\nby a Torrent so great and rapid, that 'twas impossible to Ford it:\r\nThe Emperor having by chance found a little Boat, which could not\r\nhold above 4 Persons at most, passed first with his Sons, and some\r\nof the Principal Kings followed: All the other Princes, Lords, and\r\n_Mandarines_, which the rest of the Army attended, (in the mean while)\r\nwith Impatience the return of the Boat, to carry them to the other side\r\nof the Torrent, because the Night approached, and the Tents had long\r\nbefore passed: But the Emperor being come back to us in such another\r\nBoat as the former, demanded aloud where I was? and his Father in Law\r\nhaving presented me to him, he added, let him come in and Cross over\r\nwith us: So we were the only Persons that passed with the Emperor;\r\nand all the rest stayed on the Bank, where they must pass the Night\r\n_under the open Heaven_: The same thing happened the next Day almost\r\nin the same manner. The Emperor at Noon meeting with a like rapid and\r\nswelled Torrent, gave order that the Boats should be made use of for\r\nTransporting the Tents, Packs, and other Baggage till the Evening;\r\nthen willed that I should pass alone with him and some few of his\r\nAttendants, having left on the other side all the great Lords, who\r\nwere necessitated to pass the Night there. The Emperor's Father in Law\r\nhimself, having asked if he should not pass with me, since I Lodged in\r\nhis Tent and eat at his Table? this Prince answered him, that he should\r\nstay, and he himself would take Order to give me what was necessary.\r\n\r\nAfter we had past, the Emperor sitting on the Bank-side, made me sit by\r\nhim, with the two Sons of the two petty Western Kings, and the first\r\n_Colao_ of _Tartary_, whom he distinguished on all Occasions.\r\n\r\nAs the Night was Fair, and the Heavens very Clear; he willed me to Name\r\nin the _Chinese_ and _European_ Languages, all the Constellations that\r\nthen appeared above the Horizon, and he himself first named all those\r\nhe already knew; then unfolding a small Map of the Heavens, which I\r\nhad some Years since presented him, he put himself upon inquiring the\r\nHour of the Night, by the Stars in the Meridian: Pleasing himself to\r\nshew to all the Knowledge he had acquired in these Sciences. All the\r\nMarks of his Favours which he so often gave me, even to the sending me\r\nto Eat from his own Table, these Marks I say were so Publick, and so\r\nExtraordinary; that the two Unkles of the Emperor, who bore the Titles\r\nof Associates of the Empire, being on their Return to _Pekin_, said\r\nthat when the Emperor had some Regret or appeared somewhat Sad, he\r\nwould Resume his ordinary Gaiety upon the sight of me.\r\n\r\nI arrived at _Pekin_ in perfect Health the 9_th_ day of _June_ very\r\nlate, though divers were detained in the Way by Distempers, or were\r\nreturned from their Journy, Hurt and Lamed.\r\n\r\nI say nothing of what we did for Religion in this Journy, having\r\nreserved that for a particular Relation, by which it will appear, that\r\nby the Grace of our Lord, the Favours we received at the Court of\r\n_China_, produced considerable Fruits for the Church, and did not take\r\naway the Cross from the Missionaries.\r\n\r\nI shall here add the _Tartarean_ Names, and the distance of every Place\r\nthrough which we passed in the Eastern _Tartary_, from the Capital of\r\nthe Province of _Leao-tum_ even to _Kirin_, according to the order\r\nof Days which we Spent in this Progress. A _Topographic Chart_ may\r\nbe made and inserted into the Map of the Province of _Leao-tum_, to\r\nbe found in the Atlas of Father _Martin Martinius_, by changing only\r\nthe _Latitudes_ according to the Heights of the _Pole_, which we have\r\nbefore Specified.\r\n\r\nI shall add one thing more which I Understood from the Inhabitants of\r\n_Ula_, to wit that _Nincrita_ (which is a Place much Renowned in those\r\nParts) is distant from _Ula_ 700 _Chinese Stadia_ (each of which is\r\n360 _Geometrical Paces_) and that Embarking at _Nincrita_ upon the\r\ngreat River _Heleum_, into which the _Songoro_, and some other more\r\nconsiderable Rivers are discharged, and following the course of the\r\nRiver, which runs towards the North-East, or somewhat more to the\r\nNorth, they arrive in 40 Days Journy at the Eastern Sea, which is (as I\r\nbelieve) the Streight of _Anien_: I was told this by the General of the\r\nMilitia which is at _Kirin_; and who had performed this Voyage himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _The Distances of the Places, thro' which we passed in the Eastern\r\n    _Tartary_._\r\n\r\n\r\n  The first Day we passed from _Xyn-Yam_,\r\n  the Capital of the Province of _Leao-tum_,\r\n  and we arrived at _Seao-Lysto_, so the Place is\r\n  called in the _Chinese_ Language.                         95. _stadia_.\r\n\r\n  The 2_d._ day we arrived at _Cha-cay Angha_.              85. _stadia_.\r\n\r\n  The 3_d._ day at another Torrent of the same Name.        70. _stadia_.\r\n\r\n  The 4_th._ at _Kiaghuchen_.                               50. _stadia_.\r\n\r\n  The 5_th._ at _Feyteri_.                                  80. _stadia_.\r\n\r\n  The 6_th._ at the Torrent of _Seipery_.                   60. _stadia_.\r\n\r\n  The 7_th._ at the Torrent of _Ciam_.                      60. _stadia_.\r\n\r\n  The 8_th._ at _Courou_.                                   50. _stadia_.\r\n\r\n  The 9_th._ at the Burrow of _Sape_.                       40. _stadia_.\r\n\r\n  The 10_th._ at _Quaranny Pira_.                           40. _stadia_.\r\n\r\n  The 11_th._ at _Elten eme Ambayaga_.                      70. _stadia_.\r\n\r\n  The 12_th._ at _Ypatan_.                                  58. _stadia_.\r\n\r\n  The 13_th._ at _Suayen ny Pyra_.                          60. _stadia_.\r\n\r\n  The 14_th._ at _Ylmen_.                                   70. _stadia_.\r\n\r\n  The 15_th._ at _Seuten_.                                  70. _stadia_.\r\n\r\n  The 16_th._ the City of _Kirin_.                          70. _stadia_.\r\n                                                         ------\r\n                                                          1028.\r\n\r\nAll this Course being 1028 _Chinese_ Stadia, contains 369 Miles (each)\r\nof 1000 Geometrical Paces; the _Chinese_ Stadium containing as I\r\nmentioned before 360 Geometrical Paces.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _A Voyage of the Emperor of _China_, into the Western _Tartary_, in\r\n    the Year, 1683._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Emperor this Year, which is the 30_th._ of his Age, made a Voyage\r\ninto the Western _Tartary_, together with the Queen his Grand-mother,\r\nwhich they call the Queen _Mother_; he departed the 16_th._ of _July_,\r\nin the Company of more than 60000 Men, and 100000 Horse. He positively\r\nresolved, that I, with one of the two Fathers that were at the Court of\r\n_Pekin_, the Choice of which he left to me, should follow him, I chose\r\nFather _Philip Grimaldi_; because he is the most known, and because he\r\nperfectly understood the _Mathematicks_.\r\n\r\nSeveral Reasons prevailed with the Emperor to Enterprize this Journy.\r\nThe first was, that he might keep his Militia during the Peace as well\r\nas in the Wars, in continual Exercise; and for this Reason it was,\r\nthat after he had Establish'd a firm Peace in all the Quarters of this\r\nso vast an Empire; he recalled his best Troops hither out of every\r\nProvince, and resolved in his Council to make every Year Expeditions of\r\nthis kind, in several Seasons, that by hunting of Deer, Boars, Bears,\r\nand Tigers, they might learn to overcome the Enemies of the Empire, or\r\nat least to prevent the cooling of their Courage, or the degenerating\r\nfrom their Pristine Valour, by the Luxury of _China_, in a too long\r\nRepose.\r\n\r\nIn effect these kinds of Hunting had more of the shew of a Military\r\nExpedition, than of one for Divertisement, as I have already noted:\r\nThe Emperor took in his Train, 100000 Horse, and above 60000 Men, all\r\narmed with Arrows and Cimiters, divided into Companies and Marching in\r\nBattle-Array after their Colours, with the sound of Drums and Trumpets:\r\nDuring their Hunting, they intirely invested the Mountains and\r\nForrests, as if they had been Cities which they design'd to Beleaguer;\r\nfollowing in this the manner of Hunting used by the Eastern _Tartars_,\r\nof which I have spoken in my last Letter. This Army had its Van-guard\r\nand Rear-guard, and its Main Body, its Right Wing and Left Wing, was\r\ncommanded by so many Generals and petty Kings. There were spent more\r\nthen Seventy Days before they were on their March, in bringing together\r\nall the Ammunitions of the Army upon the Waggons, upon the Camels,\r\nupon the Horses, and upon the Mules, by reason of the Incommodious\r\nWays. For in all the Western _Tartary_ (I call it Western) not with\r\nRelation to _China_, which lieth in Respect of it Westward it self,\r\nbut with respect of the Eastern _Tartary_ there is nothing to be found\r\nbut Mountains, Rocks, and Vallies; there are neither Cities, Towns\r\nnor Villages, nor so much as any Houses. The Inhabitants Lodge under\r\nTents, pitched on all sides in the open Fields. They are for the most\r\npart Graziers, and transport their Tents from one Vally to another,\r\naccording as the Pastures are better. There they Pasture their Beefs,\r\ntheir Horses, and their Camels, they breed no Hogs, nor any of those\r\nother Animals, which elsewhere are fed in the Villages, as Poultry and\r\nGeese. But only of such as the Herbs, which an uncultivated Land doth\r\nNaturally produce, will serve to sustain. They pass their Life either\r\nin Hunting, or doing nothing. And as they neither sow nor cultivate the\r\nEarth, so they make no Harvest. They Live upon Milk, Cheese, and Flesh,\r\nand have a sort of Wine, not much unlike our Aqua-vitæ; with which they\r\nmake their Feasts, and are often Drunk. In short they care for nought\r\nfrom Morning to Night, but to Drink and Eat; like the Beasts, and\r\nDroves which they Feed.\r\n\r\nThey are not without their Priests, which they call _Lamas_, for whom\r\nthey have a singular Veneration, in which they differ from the Oriental\r\n_Tartars_; the most part of whom have no Religion, nor do they believe\r\nany God. For the rest both of the one and the other are Slaves, and\r\nwholly depend upon the will of their Masters, whose Religion and\r\nManners they blindly follow: Like in this to their Droves, who go where\r\nthey are lead, and not where they ought to go.\r\n\r\nThis part of _Tartary_, lies without the prodigious Wall of _China_\r\nabout 1000 _Chinese Stadia_, that is to say more than 300 _European_\r\nMiles, and extends from the North-east towards the North.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Rides on Horse-back, in the Head of his Army through these\r\nDesert Places, and these Steep Mountains, and far from great Roads,\r\nexposed all the Day to the Scorchings of the Sun, to the Rains, and to\r\nall the Injuries of the Air. Many of those which had been in the last\r\nWar, assured me, that they had not suffered so much during all that as\r\nduring this Hunting. In so much that the Emperor, whose principal Aim\r\nit was to give his Forces a Breathing, performed effectually what he\r\npretended.\r\n\r\nThe second Reason he had of undertaking this Journy, was that he might\r\nkeep the Western _Tartars_ in their Duty, and to prevent any pernitious\r\nDesigns that might be formed against the States.\r\n\r\nIt was for this that he entred their Country with so great an Army, and\r\nwith so great Preparations for War. Having carried along several great\r\nGuns, that he might cause them to be Discharged from time to time into\r\nthe Vallies, and by the Noise and Fire which issued out of the Mouths\r\nof those Dragons, which served to Ornament them, he might cast a Dread\r\nupon the Rout.\r\n\r\nBesides this great Retinue, he would yet be accompanied with all the\r\nMarks of Grander, with which he was environed at the Court at _Pekin_.\r\nTo wit, with a Multitude of Drums, Trumpets, Timbals, and other Musical\r\nInstruments, which formed Consorts During his sitting at Table, when\r\nhe entred the Palace, or when he went out. He caused all these to\r\nMarch with him, that he might by this outward Pomp Astonish these\r\n_Barbarous_ People, to strike them with a Fear and Respect of his\r\nImperial Majesty.\r\n\r\nFor the Empire of _China_ never had any Enemies more to be feared\r\nthan these Western _Tartars_; which beginning on the East of _China_\r\nencompass it with an almost infinite of People, and keep it as it were\r\ncontinually beleaguered on the North and West sides thereof; and 'twas\r\nto make a Bulwork against their Incursions, that a _Chinese_ Emperor\r\nin antient Times caused this great Wall to be Built, which separates\r\n_China_ from their Country. I have passed it four times, and have\r\nconsidered it very attentively. And I can say without Hyperbolizing,\r\nthat all the seven Wonders of the World put together, are not\r\ncomparable to this Work. And all that Fame has spread concerning it\r\namong the _Europeans_, is far short of what I my self have seen.\r\n\r\nTwo things have more especially caused my Admiration. The first is,\r\nthat in this long extent from the East to the West, it passes in\r\nseveral places not only through vast Champains, but also above the\r\ntops of exceeding high Mountains, upon which it is raised by little\r\nand little, and fortify'd at certain Intervals with great Towers;\r\nnot distant the one from the other more than two flight Shot. At our\r\nreturn I had the Curiosity to measure the height of it in one place\r\nby means of an Instrument, and I found that it was in that Place 1037\r\nGeometrical Feet above the Horison; in such sort that 'tis hard to\r\ncomprehend how 'twas possible to elevate this enormous Bulwork to the\r\nheight we saw it, in places dry and full of Mountains, whence they\r\nmust be obliged to bring from a great distance with incredible Labour,\r\nthe Water, Brick, Mortar, and all the Materials necessary for so great\r\na Work.\r\n\r\nThe second thing that surprized me was, that this Wall is not continued\r\nupon the same Line, but bent in divers places following the situation\r\nof the Mountains, in such manner, that instead of one Wall, one may say\r\nthat there are three, which Environ all this great part of _China_.\r\n\r\nAfter all, The Monarch which in our Days hath re-united the _Chinese_\r\nand the _Tartars_, under one and the same Government, has done some\r\nthings more for the advantage of the security of _China_, than the\r\n_Chinese_ Emperor that built the long Wall. For after having reduced\r\nthe Western _Tartars_, partly by Artifice, partly by force of Arms: He\r\nhas obliged to go and remain at 300 Miles distance from the Wall of\r\n_China_; and in this Place he distributes to them Land and Pastures,\r\nwhilst he has given their Country to other _Tartars_, his Subjects\r\nwhich have their Habitation there at present: Notwithstanding which,\r\nthese Western _Tartars_ are so powerful, that if they should agree\r\ntogether, they might make themselves Masters of all _China_, and of the\r\nEastern _Tartary_, even in the Face of the Oriental _Tartars_.\r\n\r\nI have said, that the _Tartarian_ Monarch that conquered _China_,\r\nused an expedient for subduing the Western _Tartars_. For one of his\r\nfirst Cares was to engage to his Interest by his Royal Bounties, and\r\nby demonstration of a Singular Affection, the _Lamas_ (or _Priests_)\r\nthese Men having a great Repute about all those of their Nation, easily\r\nperswaded them to submit to the Government of so great a Prince; and\r\n'tis in consideration of this Service done to the Estate, that the\r\npresent Emperor looks upon these _Lamas_ with a favourable Eye, that\r\nhe bestows Presents on them; and that he makes use of them to keep the\r\n_Tartars_ in the Obedience which they owe him: Tho' at the bottom he\r\nhath nothing but Dis-esteem for their Persons, and looks upon them as\r\na sort of Ignorant Fellows, which have not the least Tincture of the\r\nSciences or commendable Arts, in which without doubt this Prince shews\r\na Wise Policy, in so disguising his true Sentiments, by these exterior\r\nMarks of Esteem and Good-will.\r\n\r\nHe has divided this vastly extended Country into 48 Provinces, who have\r\nsubmitted and are Tributary to him. From whence it comes to pass, that\r\nthe Emperor that Reigns at present in _China_, and in the one and the\r\nother _Tartary_, may justly be called the greatest and most powerful\r\nMonarch of _Asia_, having so many vast Estates under him, without being\r\nany where interrupted by the Territory of any Foreign Prince, and he\r\nalone being as the Soul which gives motion to all the Members of so\r\nvast a Body.\r\n\r\nFor after he had charged himself with the Government, he did not at all\r\nintrust the Care to any of the _Colaos_, nor to any of the great Men of\r\nhis Court. He has not at all suffered, that the Eunuchs of the Palace,\r\nor any of his Pages, or any of the young Lords that have been raised by\r\nhim, should dispose of the least thing in his House, or should regulate\r\nany thing of themselves: Which appears very extraordinary; especially\r\nif we examin what Customs his Predecessors were wont to use.\r\n\r\nHe chastises with wonderful Equity the great Ones as well as the\r\nInferiors; he deprives them of their Charges, and makes them descend\r\nfrom the Rank they held, proportioning always the Penalty to the\r\nheinousness of their Fault. He takes Cognisance of the Affairs which\r\nare transacted in the Royal Counsel, and in the other Tribunals,\r\neven to the causing them to render to him an exact account of the\r\nJudgments there given. In one Word, he of himself Disposes and Orders\r\nall things; and 'tis by reason of the absolute Authority which he hath\r\nthus acquired, that the greatest Lords of the Court, and Persons of the\r\nhighest Quality in the Empire; even the Princes of the Blood, never\r\nappear in his Presence, but with a profound Respect.\r\n\r\nBut to what remains, the _Lamas_ or _Tartarian_ Priests, of whom we\r\nhave spoken, are not only respected by the People, but also by the\r\nLords and Princes of their Nation, who for Politick Ends testifie\r\nto them a great deal of Friendship: This makes us fear that the\r\nChristian Religion, will not find so easie an entrance into the Western\r\n_Tartary_. They are also very powerful upon the Mind of the Queen\r\nMother, who is of their Country, and who is at present Threescore and\r\nTen Years Old; they are wont to tell her, that the Sect (of which she\r\nmakes Profession) has no more declared Enemies than us. And 'tis a\r\nkind of Miracle, or at least an extraordinary Protection of God, that\r\nnotwithstanding this, the Emperor, who has very much regard and respect\r\nfor her, has not hitherto ceased to heap on us Graces and Honours,\r\nconsidering us after another manner than the _Lamas_.\r\n\r\nDuring the Journey, as the Princes and the chief Officers of the Army\r\nwent oftentimes to the Queen to attend at her Court; and that we also\r\nwere advertised to do so likewise: We were willing first to consult a\r\nPerson of the Court, who loved us very much, and who spake for us to\r\nthe Emperor in our Affairs. This Lord having enter'd the Princes Tent,\r\ntold him what had passed, and presently coming out again: _The Emperor_\r\n(said he to us) _has given me to understand, that 'tis not at all\r\nnecessary for you to attend the Queen as others do_; which made us to\r\napprehend enough, that this Princess did not favour us.\r\n\r\nThe 3d Reason which the Emperor had for making this Journey, was for\r\nhis Health: because he knew by his Experience long enough, that when he\r\nis too long at _Pekin_ without going Abroad, he cannot avoid his being\r\nattacked by several Distempers, which he prevents by means of these\r\nlong Progresses. For during the whole time he never sees any Woman; and\r\nthat which is more surprizing, there appears not any one in all this\r\ngreat Army, except those which are of the Retinue of the Queen Mother:\r\n'Tis yet also a Novelty that she has accompanyed the King this Year, it\r\nhaving not been practiced above once, when he took with him the three\r\nQueens as far as the Capital City of the Province of _Leao-tum_, to\r\nvisit the Sepulchers of their Ancestors.\r\n\r\nThe Emperor and the Queen Mother pretend moreover by this Journey, to\r\navoid the excessive Heats which are in _Pekin_, in the Summer during\r\nthe Dog-days. For in this part of _Tartary_, there reigns during the\r\nMonths of _July_ and _August_ so cold a Wind, especially in the Night,\r\nthat 'tis necessary to put on thick Cloths and Furs. The Reason that\r\nmay be assigned for this so extraordinary Cold, is that this Region is\r\nvery much elevated and full of Mountains: There is one among the rest,\r\nupon which we continually ascended, for the space of 5 or 6 Days March.\r\nThe Emperor being desirous to know how much it surmounted the Plains of\r\n_Pekin_, distant about 300 Miles; at our return (after having measured\r\nthe height of above a hundred Mountains that lay in our Road) we found\r\nthat it had 3000 Geometrical Pace of Elevation, above the Sea that\r\nnearest approached _Pekin_.\r\n\r\nThe Salt Peter also with which these Countries abound, may contribute\r\nto this great Cold, which is so violent, that in digging the Earth to\r\nthree or four Foot deep, there are fetched out Clods all frozen, and\r\npieces of Ice.\r\n\r\nDivers of the Petty Kings of the Western _Tartary_, came from all sides\r\nfor 300 Miles, and some for 500 Miles, together with their Children,\r\nto salute the Emperor. These Princes, who for the most part know none\r\nbut by their own natural Language, which is very different from that of\r\nthe Eastern _Tartary_: Took regard of us, with Aspects and Gestures of\r\na goodness very particular. There were some among them, who had made a\r\nJourney to _Pekin_ to see the Court, and who had seen our Church.\r\n\r\nOne or two Days before we arrived at the Mountain which was the\r\nboundary of our Journey, we met a Petty King very aged, who returned\r\nfrom accompanying the Emperor, he seeing us stayed with all his\r\nRetinue, and enquired by his Interpreter, which of us was called\r\n_Nauboaij_; one of our Servants having made a sign that it was I, this\r\nPrince accosted me with a great deal of Civility, and told me that for\r\na long time he had known my Name, and that he had desired to know me.\r\nHe spoke also to Father _Grimaldi_, with the same marks of Affection.\r\nThe favourable Entertainment he gave us in this Re-encounter, gave some\r\nReason to hope that our Religion might find an easie Entrance to those\r\nPrinces, particularly if care be taken to insinuate into the Minds of\r\nthose Princes, by the means of the Mathematicks: Which if there should\r\nat any time be a design to penetrate into their Country, the most sure\r\nway for divers Reasons, (which I have not the leisure to explain here)\r\nwill be to begin the entrance with the other _Tartars_ more remote,\r\nwhich are not all Subjects of this Empire, from whom we may pass on to\r\nthese, advancing by little and little towards _China_.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole Journey, the Emperor has continued to give us singular\r\nTokens of his good Will, shewing us Favours in the sight of his Army,\r\nwhich he shewed to none besides.\r\n\r\nOne time meeting us in a great Valley, where we were measuring the\r\nheight and the distance of some Mountains, he made a stay with the\r\nwhole Court; and calling to us from a great distance, he demanded of\r\nus in the _Chinese_ Language, _Hao-mo?_ that is to say, are you well\r\nin Health? And then asked us several Questions in the _Tartarian_\r\nLanguage, concerning the heighth of these Mountains, to which I\r\nanswered also in the same Language; after which, turning to the Lords\r\nthat were about him, he discoursed with them concerning us in very\r\nobliging Expressions, as I learned the same Night from the Prince his\r\nUnkle, who was then by his side.\r\n\r\nHe testifyed also his Affection to us, by causing often Meat to be\r\ncarry'd to our Tents from his own Table, willing also that on some\r\nOccasions we should eat in his; and every time he did us this Honour,\r\nhe had a regard to our Days of Abstinence, and of Fasting, sending us\r\nonly such Meats as we could use.\r\n\r\nThe eldest Son of the Emperor, after the Example of his Father, gave us\r\nmarks also of his Bounty, for having been constrained to stay more than\r\n10 Days, by reason of a fall from his Horse, by which he was hurt in\r\nhis right Shoulder; and one part of the Army in which we were, having\r\nattended, whilst the Emperor with the other, continued his Hunting,\r\nhe was not wanting in sending to us daily, and sometimes twice a Day,\r\nduring this space, Food from his own Table. In fine, we look'd on all\r\nthese Favours of the Royal Family, as the effects of a particular\r\nProvidence which watched over us, and over Christianity, for which we\r\nhad so much the more occasion to thank God, for that the affection\r\nof the Emperor, was never so constantly shewn to the Grandees of the\r\nEmpire, nor to the Princes of the Blood.\r\n\r\nAs to what relates to the other particularities of our Journey, they\r\nare like to those which happened to us the last Year, in the Journey to\r\nthe Eastern _Tartary_, which I have fully described in my last Letter;\r\nthat is to say, that we made use of the Emperor's Horses, and of his\r\nLitters, that we lodged in the Tents, and eat at the Table of the\r\nPrince his Unkle, to whom he had particularly recommended us.\r\n\r\nDuring more than 600 Miles, which we had passed in going and returning\r\n(for we did not return by the same Road) he caused to be made a great\r\nHigh-way cross the Mountains and the Vallies, for the Queen Mother, who\r\nwent in a Chariot; he caused also an infinite number of Bridges to be\r\nmade over the Torrents, as also the Rocks to be cut, and the Points of\r\nthe Mountains, with incredible Pains and Expences: Father _Grimaldi_\r\nshall describe the other particulars in his Letters.\r\n\r\nAs to the benefit which the Religion may draw from our Journey, I have\r\nspoken elsewhere; it sufficeth to say that the Emperor, to whose Will\r\nwe cannot make the least resistance, without exposing all this Mission\r\nto a manifest Danger, has order'd us to follow him. I ceased not\r\nhowever to speak twice to that Lord of the Court, who is our particular\r\nFriend, to excuse us for the time to come from these long Journeys, and\r\nespecially me, _who am not of an Age fit for it_: I tried to obtain at\r\nleast that they would be contented to take only one of us; the Letters\r\nof our Fathers were daily brought us during the Journey, and I had\r\nthe convenience of writing to them, by means of the Couriers which\r\ncontinually went to and came from the Royal City: I write all this in\r\nhaste, that I may continue to give you an account of our Affairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _An Explanation, necessary to justify the _Geography_ supposed in\r\n    these Letters._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt may seem wonderful, that the Author of these Letters makes mention\r\nin his former, of a kind of War between the _Oriental Tartars_ and the\r\n_Muscovites_, notwithstanding the extream distance these People appear\r\nto be from one another in our Geographical Charts; but those who know\r\nhow much the _Muscovites_ have extended the Bounds of the Empire along\r\nthe _Tartarian_ Sea, will judge the thing less difficult, besides those\r\nwho have seen these Countries, have made Discoveries much differing\r\nfrom those which our Geographers have informed us of hitherto. Very\r\nlately _Monsieur D'Arcy_, who commands one of the King's Ships, in the\r\nFleet of _Monsieur Le Marescal d'Estrees_, informed us, that having\r\nserved in _Poland_, and having been made Governor of a Place towards\r\n_Moscovy_, the _Moscovite_ Ambassadors in their return having pass'd by\r\nhim, and being by him treated in such a manner as put them into a very\r\ngood Humour; one of them shewed him a Chart of the Countries between\r\n_Moscovy_ and _China_: and told him, that from three Cities which he\r\nshewed him, whose Names were _Lopsla_, _Abasinko_, _Nerginsko_, all\r\nthree under the Government of the great Dukes, tho' situated in the\r\ngreat _Tartary_, there was a way to _Pekin_, which was not more than\r\n25 or 30 Days Journey. This Map it seems must be kept very secret in\r\n_Moscovy_: For the next Day the _Moscovite_ was in despair, for having\r\ngiven it, saying that if it should be known, he should come to great\r\nDamage. The Officer being come back since into _France_, has given a\r\nCopy to the King, and another to _Monsieur Le Marquis de Signelay_.\r\nTo confirm this, it may be added, what a _French_ Man has writ from\r\n_Moscovy_ within this two Months, that they are actually raising Troops\r\nto go to War with the _Chinese_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Some Observations and Conjectures concerning the _Chinese_\r\n    Characters. Made by _R. H._ R. S. S._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhether there ever were any Language natural, I dispute not: But\r\nthat there have been, are, and may be, artificial Languages 'tis not\r\ndifficult to prove. The _Chinese_ Court Language is said to be of\r\nthis kind, invented and spoken by the _Literati_ and _Mandarines_\r\nthroughout the whole Empire of _China_, differing from all the other\r\nLanguages spoken in it, and I conjecture it to be nothing else but\r\nthe Names of the Character by which they write and express their\r\nmeaning, arbitrarily imposed by them, as we in _Europe_ set names to\r\nArithmetical Figures, not as we pronounce Words written with a litteral\r\nCharacter. This I Judge by comparing the Characters with the Names,\r\nMonosyllables or Words they pronounce and read them with. Nor do they\r\nascend above a Monosyllabical Name, tho' the Character be composed\r\nof many single Characters, each of which hath its proper Sense, and\r\nMonosyllabical Name, and though the meaning of each Character, be an\r\ningredient in the Notion of that compounded Character.\r\n\r\nI might give an Instance also in the Artificial Language Invented by\r\nthe Late Reverend Bishop of _Chester_ Dr. _Wilkins_, which in all the\r\naccomplishments of Language doth excel any one yet extant; to which is\r\nalso annexed a real Character, Legible into that or any other Language\r\nSpoken. By which Language the Character and every additional Mark\r\nis effable, and yet the Character is not Literal but Real, which is\r\nmore curious and useful than the _Chinese_ way. Great pity it is that\r\nDiscourse is not published in Latin, that the Learned of _Europe_, may\r\nthink of further Improving it, and bringing it to Use.\r\n\r\nBut whatever we may judge of Language, 'tis past dispute that\r\nWriting was ever Artificial, how Antiently so ever it were in Use,\r\nand was the Invention of some thinking and Studious Men. 'Tis also\r\nevident that there have been various ways thought of for Expressing\r\nSignificancy, according to the several _Genii_ of the Persons that were\r\nthe Inventors. As may be guessed by the _Ægyptian_ Hieroglyphicks,\r\nthe _Chinese_ Characters, the _Mexican_ Chronology, and the Literal\r\nCharacters of several Nations, each of which seem to proceed upon\r\ndiffering methods, and from differing thoughts of Invention.\r\n\r\nWhich of these ways is the most Antient, is hard to prove. The\r\n_Ægyptian Mummies_ and _Obelesks_ prove a great Antiquity of the\r\nHieroglyphicks, but yet the _Chinese_ Chronology (if to be credited)\r\noutstrips the _Ægyptian_ in pretence to Antiquity. For the _Chinese_\r\nmake _Fohi_, the first King of _China_, to be the inventer of their\r\nCharacter: And account him to have lived 2950 Years before the time\r\nof Christ, during all which time they pretend to have a certain\r\nand written Account in their Books: But their Account of the times\r\npreceding, they esteem more Hypothetical and Fabulous; depending\r\nchiefly upon Fiction and Oral Tradition: As you will easily believe,\r\nwhen you understand how many Years they make it since the Creation of\r\nthe World to the present Year 1686. which by the Account thereof in Mr.\r\n_Graves_'s Translation of _Vulg. Beig._ will be found to be no less\r\nthan eighty eight millions six hundred and forty thousand one hundred\r\nand two Solar Years, there having been run out since the Creation 8864\r\n_Ven._ of Years (every _Ven._ containing ten thousand such Years) and\r\nof the present _Ven._ this Year 1686. is the 102d. Which Account is\r\nabundantly more extravagant than the _Ægyptian_: But this need not\r\ninvalidate their History since _Fohi_; by which it appears that their\r\nCharacter was invented before the time of _Moses_ about 1400 Years,\r\nand even before _Menes_ the first King of _Ægypt_ about 500 Years. So\r\nthat the _Chinese_ Invention of Writing or Characters, seems to be the\r\nmost ancient of that kind. And the Book _Yekim_ said to be written by\r\n_Fohi_, the most antient Book.\r\n\r\nThese Accounts made me the more desirous to understand somewhat of\r\nthe Reality and Truth, of what is related concerning the Knowledge of\r\nLiterature and manual Arts, which these People of _China_ are said to\r\nhave possessed so long a time in so great Perfection, and without\r\nAlteration from the primitive Institution, especially upon the Account\r\nof their Art of Printing, which gave a hint to the Inventors of that\r\nadmirable and most useful of all Inventions (for the Common Wealth of\r\nLearning) the way of Printing here in _Europe_. For _Paulus Jovius_\r\naffirms that the first occasion of that Invention in _Germany_, was a\r\n_German_ Merchant, who returning out of _China_ into his own Country,\r\nrelated what he had observed concerning the Practice of it as used in\r\nthat Country. And tho' the _Chinese_ way be wholly differing as to\r\nthe method of composing, from what was invented and perfected here:\r\nYet such an intimation was enough to an ingenious Artist to improve\r\nthe first Contrivance, and make it more accomodate to the literal way\r\nof Writing with us: And as our way may possibly be now brought to the\r\ngreatest Perfection for exactness and expedition, so without doubt\r\nmust be their way of Printing any thing just as it is written, since I\r\nfind, that they can engrave their Stamps for a Sheet, as soon as one of\r\nour Compositers can set and correct a Sheet of our literal Character,\r\nand when so done, one Man alone will print off 1500 Sheets in one Day.\r\nAnd though 'tis generally believed to be much the same with our Wooden\r\nCuts for Printing, yet from some Observations I have made, I believe\r\nit to be much another way; of which I shall hereafter say more when I\r\ndescribe their other Arts of Pottery, Staining, Varnishing, _&c._\r\n\r\nBy a _Chinese_ Manuscript, out of which I transcribed the Lord's Prayer\r\nin the Year 1666 (when it was lost) I found that the Pronunciations\r\nhad no affinity with the stroaks of the Character. Whence I conceived\r\nit was either a numeral Character consisting of Numbers, or else a\r\nreal Character, but not a literal, unless it were a literal Character\r\nof some other Language than that by which it was pronounced, whose\r\npronunciation is lost though the significancy be retained, as if one\r\nshould read what is written in _Hebrew_ בראשיהברא into the _Latin_ or\r\n_Roman_ Language, _In Principio Cræavit_ instead of _Brasit bra_, or\r\n_Beresith Bara_ according to the _Masorethæ_.\r\n\r\nSince that time I procured from _China_, a Dictionary of the Court\r\nLanguage, (as I found it written upon by the Person that sent it me\r\nfrom thence) but this whole Book (which I found was Printed) consisted\r\nonly of the _Chinese_ Characters without any Interpretation, or\r\nPronunciation; however by the help of the Pictures of that, and a\r\n_Chinese_ Almanack, I quickly found out their Characters for Numbers,\r\nand their way of Numeration, together with the Figure and Use of\r\ntheir _Abacus_ or counting Board, for performing the Operations of\r\n_Arithmetick_, which I find pretty near to agree with that of the\r\nantient _Romans_ (a Description and Picture of which is given by\r\n_Ursinus_, _Pignorius_ and _Velserus_) save only, that, instead of\r\nPins and sliding Groves of the _Roman_, the _Chinese Abacus_ hath\r\nStrings or Wires and Beads, to slide upon them; and that, instead of\r\nfour Pins for Digits or Units, the _Chinese_ hath five Beads: So that\r\nit may seem to argue that the _Chinese Abacus_ was designed for a\r\n_Duodecimal_ Progression: Whereas that of the _Romans_ was design'd for\r\nthe _Decimal_.\r\n\r\nOne thing is remarkable in the _Chinese_, that I find the _Abacus_ to\r\nlie Horizontal, and their first place to be that next the left Hand,\r\nwhich I judge was also the first in their old way of reading, much\r\nthe same with ours, though their other Characters are erected (as I\r\nshall by and by shew) from the posture of Writing and Reading, which\r\nI conjecture they did at first make use of; and what does yet further\r\nagree with this conjecture, is remarkable in the newly mentioned\r\nTreatise of _Vulg. Beig._ That whereas the way of Writing and Reading\r\nused by the _Arabs_, was from the right to the left, the first place or\r\nthe place of Units in their Numeration, was that next the right Hand;\r\nand so came first to be read: As did that of _China_, who as I conceive\r\nread the contrary way, from the left to the right.\r\n\r\nIt appears therefore by this Remark that we received this way of\r\nexpressing Numbers from the _Arabians_, for that we keep the same\r\nposture or position of places with them, tho' our progression in\r\nWriting and Reading be the contrary way. And though we now read them\r\nalso in the order they are set, twenty one, twenty two, thirty six,\r\nforty eight, _&c._ yet we retain also the other way of Pronouncing,\r\n_viz._ one and twenty, two and twenty, six and thirty, eight and forty,\r\n_&c._\r\n\r\nNow as the _Chinese_ and _Roman Abacus_ do much agree save only that\r\nthey proceed contrary ways, so doth their way of expressing Numbers by\r\nLetters or Marks, one stroke or line signifying one; two lines two;\r\nthree lines three; a cross ten; two crosses twenty; three crosses\r\nthirty; and so onwards to a hundred, which they expressed by a square\r\nMark, and a cross with a stroak added for a thousand, as will appear by\r\nthe Table annexed. And though the Characters are not all the same; yet\r\nthe order and method of one agrees very near with that of the other,\r\nespecially if I may be allowed my supposition, that the primitive way\r\nof Writing and Reading with the _Chinese_ was Horizontal, and like the\r\n_Greek_ and _Latin_ or _European_ way. Now that these are properly\r\nnumeral Figures, or Characters, is manifest from this, that they have\r\nalso word Characters for every Number, and they can (in the same manner\r\nas the _Romans_ could) express a Number by their numeral characters\r\nor Marks, and by their literal or word Characters; for as one single\r\nstroak signifies one or the first, so does the Character (_in the Plate\r\nmarked with E_) signify the same thing, that is one or the first.\r\n\r\nHaving thus discovered their Characters for Numbers, and their way of\r\nNumeration, I was next desirous to understand something concerning\r\ntheir Language and Character.\r\n\r\nUpon perusing all the Accounts I could meet with in Books, I found very\r\nlittle satisfaction as to what I principally inquired after, which\r\nwas first concerning the method of the Character, whether it consisted\r\nof a certain number of Marks methodically disposed like Letters in a\r\nliteral, or like Numbers in a Numeral, or like Radicals in composite\r\nand decomposite Derivations? 'Tis said to be legible into a great\r\nmany Languages considerably different one from another, but how this\r\nis effected is not related, only 'tis said that the Marks are of the\r\nnature of our Arithmetical Figures, (which are become almost Universal\r\nat least to us here in _Europe_,) and 2dly, concerning the number of\r\nthese Characters? to which I found as little satisfaction; for, by\r\nsome Relations I found that there were 120000, by others 80000, and\r\nby others 60000. And that a Man must be able to remember to Write and\r\nRead at least 8000, or 10000, before he will be able to express his\r\nmeaning thereby, and that it is the business of a Man's whole Life to\r\nbe throughly understanding in the whole Character; seeming to intimate\r\nthat the Characters are immethodical, and there are as many primitive\r\nCharacters as Words. Others tell us of various kinds of Characters\r\nwhich have been in use in several Ages. The first they say were\r\n_Hieroglyphical_ like the _Ægyptian_ or _Mexican_, consisting of the\r\nPictures of Animals and Vegetables. But that the last are made up of\r\nLines and Points, that they have no such thing as Letters or Syllables,\r\nbut every distinct Word and Notion has a distinct Character, and that\r\nall are primitive or in composite, so that if _Calepines_ Dictionary\r\nwere to be translated into the _Chinese_, 'twere necessary to have\r\nas many distinct radical Characters as there are Words therein to be\r\nfound, which accounts do seem to insinuate that this Character is the\r\nmost difficult, and the most perplexed piece of Learning in the World,\r\nand depends wholly upon the strength of the Memory, in retaining the\r\nform and signification of a perplexed scrawl. But whether they who gave\r\nus these Accounts did do it knowingly, is much to be doubted, my own\r\nObservations, at least, make me think otherwise.\r\n\r\nI have not yet been able to procure sufficient helps to inform my self\r\nof the whole Art of Writing and Reading the _Chinese_ Character, and I\r\nfear the Relations I have hitherto met with concerning it, were written\r\nby such as did not well understand it, however from such helps as I\r\nhad, what I collected or do conjecture, I shall here relate. The best\r\nhelp I had, was the perusal of some Books Printed in _China_, with the\r\npronunciation and signification of the Character in Latin Letters. By\r\nthese Books then I observed, first, that every one of their Characters,\r\nwhether consisting of more or fewer strokes or marks, were comprised\r\nwithin a certain square space, which is proportion'd according to the\r\nbigness of the size or manner of Writing, they design there to make\r\nuse of, not that the whole Square is filled with every Character, but\r\nthat no part of that Character does exceed the limits of that Square,\r\nso that tho' the Character have but one stroak, it takes as much room\r\nin the line as another that hath 20 or 30 several Marks, so that their\r\nCharacters are most exactly ranged in Rank and File, not unlike our\r\nNumbers in Arithmetick.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding which I find they do vary the bigness of the Character\r\nupon several Occasions, as in the Titles of Books, in the Titles of\r\nthe Chapters or Sections, in the Comments, Explications or Notes, and\r\nupon several other occasions of variety, which they do at Pleasure\r\nwith their Pencil, as we use variety of Letters in the Printing of a\r\nBook. The Titles of Books are generally in very large Characters, 6 or\r\n8 times as big as those of the Book, the explication Notes ½ of the\r\nbigness, the Contents usually twice as big, and the like variety on\r\nseveral other occasions. I have met with also three several kinds of\r\nCharacters, the most usual is the fixed or set square form. The second\r\nsort is the running Hand, in which the orders of the Courts are written\r\nby their Secretaries, of which I have seen 3 or 4 kinds, in which the\r\nPencil is never taken off, till the whole Character be finished, and\r\nsometimes two or three are all written without break. The third seems\r\nto be somewhat like the flourishing great Letters, used by Scriveners\r\nat the beginning of Deeds, and by the _Germans_ in the beginning of\r\nChapters and Sections. They are compounded of the same strokes as the\r\nset Character, but modulated and shaped a little otherwise to make them\r\nappear the more beautiful and regular. A Specimen of each of these\r\nthree are in the Plate. This third is made use of for Epitaphs, and\r\nother Inscriptions on Buildings or Monuments. These three sorts I may\r\ncall the three general kinds of Writing, but there is to be found an\r\nalmost infinite variety of forms which Men use. This will be the more\r\neasie to be believed, when we consider that the Printed Characters\r\nare exactly the same with the Written, insomuch that every variety in\r\neach stroke, line or point, that is or can be made with the Pencil,\r\nis perfectly expressed in the Impression, and the Form, Mode, or\r\nHand, as we call it, of every Writer is exhibited so curiously, that\r\nI think it hardly possible to be performed after the way of wooden\r\nCuts, as Authors affirm it is, but must be done after the method of our\r\nCopper Cuts, Printed by a Roll-press, which the way of expressing the\r\nRunning or Court-Hand, does, I conceive, most evidently demonstrate,\r\nand from divers circumstances, I could evidently make appear from the\r\nBook it self, which I cannot so well express in Writing. Their Paper\r\nis generally very thin and fine, and very transparent, but brown, so\r\nthat whatever is Written or Printed on it, is almost as legible on\r\nthe back, as on the foreside, which is of great use in the cutting of\r\ntheir Stamps. And thence they never Write or Print on both sides of\r\nthe same Leaf, but only on one, and to make the Leaf appear Printed on\r\nboth sides, they double the Sheet with the Printed sides outwards, and\r\nputting the folded part forward, they Sew, Bind, or Stitch together,\r\nall these Sheets with the cut Edges, and upon whole Sheets instead of\r\nsingle Leaves; just in the same manner as the Plate annexed to this\r\nDiscourse is Printed. They begin the Book on the top of the right Hand\r\nside of the Page that is next the right Hand, and they read downwards\r\nto the bottom, then begin the next Line towards the left Hand at the\r\ntop, and so read to the bottom, and so proceed to the end of the Book.\r\nBut this I suppose not to be the primitive or first way of Writing or\r\nReading. The Title of the Book is set first upon a whole Leaf, usually\r\nof a thicker Paper, and some Title is likewise Written upon the folding\r\nor edge of every Sheet, where is set also the Number of the Book, and\r\nthe Number of the Sheet, half of which appears on one side, and half on\r\nthe other side of the fold.\r\n\r\nAs to the Character it self, (I find by all the Books and Writings\r\nI have yet met with of that kind) that each of them is made up of a\r\ncertain number of Strokes, Lines or Marks, which are very distinct\r\nfrom each other in their shape and position, and by reason that these\r\nare single Strokes, and as I conceive uncompounded, I think they may\r\nbe called the Letters, Elements or Particles, out of which the more\r\ncompounded Characters are constructed or contexed. These are the first\r\nkind of which there are but a very few, and I think those I have\r\ndescribed in the thirteenth Line of the Plate are all.\r\n\r\nTwo, three, four, or more of these joined together in a certain order\r\nand contexture (in the doing of which there is a great Regularity and\r\nOrder observed, which is not varied from, and all within the regular\r\nsquare Space) I conceive do make Syllables or primitive radical\r\nCharacters, each of which have a primitive, single or distinct Notion\r\nor Signification as well as Sound, which is made much use of in the\r\nmore compounded Characters or Words. Of this kind I take the Figures\r\nof the Numbers to be: If at least they are not single Letters like the\r\nway of expressing Numbers in the _Hebrew_, _Greek_, _Arabick_, &c.\r\nLanguages, for though there may be two or three of the single strokes\r\njoyned together into a compound Character, it hinders not, but that\r\nit may still signify a Letter, as in the _Greek_ ΛΑ.Δ.Ι.Γ.Π.Γ. In\r\nthe Runick; where every Letter hath one upright Line and some other\r\nadditional Marks: In the _Roman_ I.L.F.E.O.Q.V.Y: Or it may signify a\r\nSyllable as in the _Æthiopick_, and in the _Hanscret_, and _Sunscrit_\r\nLanguages and Characters: The first of which being the _Brackmans_\r\nCharacter we find in _P. Kircher_'s _China Illustrata_, described by\r\n_P. Roth_ who studied it seven Years; and the second (being a literal\r\nCharacter used over all _India_ by the Merchants) I have seen in a\r\nTranscript, brought lately out of _India_ by a very Worthy Gentleman\r\nwho lived there many Years, and had the Curiosity to cause to be\r\nTranscribed and Translated also into English, a Dictionary of their\r\nLanguage in their own Character: who did me the favour to let me peruse\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn which Characters or ways of Writing a Vowel is always join'd with a\r\nConsonant into one compound Character to make it effable. And then the\r\nsingle Strokes may be taken for single ineffable Letters as are the\r\nConsonants, and the composition of two or three (of which one at least\r\nmay be a Vowel) will make Syllables.\r\n\r\nOf this kind, there are not so many in the whole _Chinese_ Character,\r\nbut that it will be easie enough to assign each a proper Monosyllable\r\nwhich shall only have 1 or 2 Consonants, and one or two Vowels; that\r\nis, the Consonants together, and not separate, either both behind the\r\nVowel or Vowels, if it be a Diphthong or both after it or them.\r\n\r\nOf this kind, I understand there are about 500, probably 8×8×8, or 512.\r\nI could enumerate a great many, and give you also the Name or Words\r\nby which they are pronounced as also their signification, but (as I\r\nsaid before) first, I conceive the present _Chinese_ Language to have\r\nno affinity at all with the Character, the true primitive, or first\r\nLanguage, or Pronunciation of it, having been lost. And secondly, I\r\nwant some further help to make a full and compleat Discovery: What I\r\nhave learn'd from the Book of _Fohi_ I shall give the next opportunity;\r\nwhich will explain the reason of the multiplication of 8. and the order\r\nand method of places in the Letter or Word square.\r\n\r\nThe third sort of Characters, is a decompounded sort being made\r\nup of two, three or more of those of the second kind, diminish'd\r\nproportionably in their size, either as to their length, or breadth,\r\nor both, from what they have in the same Writing when they are single\r\nand fill up the whole Letter square or Words square. For there being\r\nseveral of them to be crouded together within the same square,\r\naccording as there are more in number, so they are always more squeezed\r\ntogether. In this decompound sort, there is a regular Order observed in\r\nthe placing of the several Characters of the 2d sort; there being some\r\nthat are always on the left side, some always on the right, some at\r\nthe top, some at the bottom. Of which I doubt not but that they have a\r\ncertain regular Method, which had we Dictionaries explained, would be\r\neasie enough to be discovered.\r\n\r\nThis method alone of crouding together all the Characters (how many\r\nsoever go to make up the decompounded Character) into one square (which\r\nis of the same size for the most Simple and for the most Compound)\r\nseems to be the great singularity, by which the _Chinese_ Characters\r\ndiffer from those of all the rest of the World. And this I conceive has\r\nbeen the reason why all People, and possibly even the very _Chinese_\r\nthemselves have, and do believe it to be a real and not a literal\r\nCharacter: For if the primitive Language, or pronunciation of the\r\nCharacters be lost (as I conceive it is) and that the disposition,\r\norder, method, texture, or manner of placing the more simple in the\r\nmore compound Characters be also lost, forgotten, or not understood;\r\nthen the whole Characters becomes a real and not a literal Character:\r\nAnd an immethodical one to such as want a method, that must be learned\r\nby rote, and depend wholly upon the strength of the Memory to retain\r\nit. But I conceive it might be at first either a literal Character, and\r\nso the whole square Character was composed of so many distinct Letters\r\nor Syllables, which composed the Word signified thereby; and so there\r\nmight be a regular Order of placing these Letters in the Character,\r\nthat is, that the whole square being divided into so many parts, there\r\nwas a Rule which was the first, second, third and fourth place: so\r\nthat there being placed in those the several Letters that made up the\r\nWord, according to the order they had in the Word, it was easie by that\r\nRule to Decipher the said Character, and thence to find the Word and\r\nthe Signification, as regularly as if the Letters had been written one\r\nafter another, as most other literal Characters we know are at this Day\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\nOr Secondly, it might be a real Character consisting of divers Marks\r\nor Letters, that expressed so many simple Notions, several of which\r\njoined together might make up the more compounded Characters, of\r\nwhich I have added some Examples in the Plate, which may be also made\r\nliteral and pronounceable, tho' that consideration were not made use\r\nof, when they were first invented. What things I have observed in my\r\n_Chinese_ Books that seem to respect this Method, I will give more\r\nparticulars of by the next opportunity, by Printing a Specimen of\r\nthe Book _Ye-kim_ which explicated by these Notions will I conceive\r\nappear more intelligible, than by the Accounts we find given of it\r\nby the _Chinese_ Commentators, and those that have Translated them\r\ninto _Latin_, who seem not to have understood the true design thereof:\r\nFor both the _Chinese_ and _European_ Commentators assert it to be a\r\nConjuring Book, or a Book to tell Fortunes by, and to be made use of\r\nby the _Chinese_ for that purpose; whereas by the small Specimen I\r\nhave seen of it, I conceive it to contain the whole Ground, Rule or\r\nGrammar, of their Character, Language and Philosophy, and that by the\r\nunderstanding of it, the Foundation and Rule of their Language and\r\nCharacter may be without much difficulty Deciphered and Understood.\r\n\r\nThe present use of this Character, I conceive to be differing from what\r\nit was at first, both as to the position of Writing and Reading it, and\r\nas to the Expression and Pronunciation thereof.\r\n\r\nFor the way of Writing and Reading it, I conceive might at first be\r\nexactly the same with that of the _Greeks_, _Romans_, _English_, and\r\nall other _European_ Nations, and also the _Æthiopick_ and _Coptick_.\r\nThat is, they began at the top of the Page towards the left Hand, and\r\nso proceeded towards the right in the _Horizontal_ Line to the end of\r\nit, and then began at the left end of the next Line under the first\r\nand proceeded with that in the same manner, and so with the next under\r\nthat and all the remaining. Continuing to Write the Words of the Line\r\ntowards the right Hand, and the Lines of the Page one under another\r\ntill the whole Discourse were compleated, joyning Leaf to Leaf one\r\nunder another, after the same manner as the Rouls are at present Writ,\r\nand as the _Volumina_ were of the Ancients. And to make the parts of\r\nthe Volume to be the more easily to be come at, without the trouble of\r\nrolling and unrolling as the Ancient _Romans_ did, and we do with our\r\nRouls, they contrived to fold them, like the folds of a Fan, forwards\r\nand backward: And so stitching them together, that the Written sides\r\nmight lie outwards, and open freely one from another, and the fair\r\nsides might meet together, it came to make the present form of their\r\nBook, which being laid as we generally place our Books before us, they\r\nseem to begin at the top of the Page on the right Hand, and to proceed\r\nto the bottom, and then at the top of the next Line towards the left\r\nHand, and descend as in the former; proceeding in this order with\r\nall the rest, which way must needs be very inconvenient for Writing,\r\nhowever they may use their Pencil differing from our Pen. Though there\r\nbe a way of Writing from the top to the bottom of the Page, which is\r\nvery convenient for Writing the _Syriack_, as also for Writing _Latin_,\r\n_English_, or _Greek_, where the Writing is to be used for cutting the\r\nStamps of Wood, or graving of Copper Plates with the same Character for\r\nPrinting, in which Cases the Letters must be written backwards.\r\n\r\nSecondly, as to the Pronunciation of this Character, by the Court\r\nLanguage, or by any other now used, I conceive it to be wholly\r\ndiffering from that of a literal Character, that is from being\r\npronounced or spoken according to the Marks or Figures thereof,\r\nwhether they be simple or compounded, and made up of simple Characters\r\n(though there are some Instances of affinity in Characters and Words.)\r\nThe reason of which differing pronunciation I conceive may have\r\nproceeded, partly from the loss of the primitive Language, for which it\r\nwas made, partly from a most inconvenient affection of Monosyllabical\r\nWords in this Court Language, to help the Poverty of which, they are\r\nfain to make one Syllable to signifie many differing Notions, to do\r\nwhich they have introduced a kind of Musical toning or accenting of\r\neach of them, and not single but compound of two or three Tones to each\r\nsignification of every one of these Monosyllables: Partly from the\r\nusing of this way of Writing, by divers Nations of differing Languages,\r\nwho minding only the Figure and Signification, read it into their own\r\nMother Tongues, as we in _Europe_ do Arithmetical Figures: And partly,\r\nalso from the omission of most Grammatical Distinctions, the same\r\nCharacter serving for Substantive and Adjective, Singular and Plural,\r\nin all Cases, (save only they have some Characters for Particles, as\r\n_of_ and _to_ in English) for the Verb in all Tenses, and Numbers,\r\n_&c._ for the abstract and the concrete Signification, and for divers\r\nMetaphorical; if at least the Interpretation I have met with in the\r\nBooks I have perused be exact: Partly, also from the _Syntaxis_ of\r\nthem, it being necessary to consider the whole Sentence, to discover\r\nwhich part of Speech each Character is of, in that Sentence, wherein\r\nthe Order and Positions of the Characters to one another, for which\r\nthey have Rules, hath its signification: And lastly, from the loss of\r\nthe very Notion of a literal Character, whence for the expressing of\r\nproper Names, they are fain to make use of several Characters, whose\r\nSounds or Words come nearest to the Sounds of the Syllables of that\r\nName, as in the Plate _tam. jo, van_, for _Adam. Jovan_.\r\n\r\nNow, though I conceive this Character is not effable properly as\r\na literal Character by any of their present Languages: And though\r\npossibly it might be at first a real Character, that is each of them\r\ncompounded of such Strokes or Marks as by their Figures, Positions\r\nand Numbers in the square, denoted the several Philosophical\r\nIngredients, that made up the Notion of the whole Character, as the\r\nBook _Ye-Kim_ seems to shew by giving Rules as I conceive for the\r\nOrder and Significancy of places in the Square, _&c._ Yet I think\r\nit not difficult to make it a Literal, or at least a Syllabical\r\nCharacter, and legible into a Language somewhat after the manner of\r\nthe Universal Character I mentioned before. And tho' this would not\r\nbe the primitive Language for which it was made, yet for the present\r\nuses of it (the chiefest of which is the assisting and refreshing the\r\nMemory, and helping the Imagination by proper Sounds) it might be as\r\ngood: Wherein the single Characters might be Monosyllables and the\r\ncompounded Dissyllables, Trissyllables, _&c._ According to the Numbers\r\nand Order of simple Characters in the square of the Compounded. And\r\nI am apt to think that the present pronunciation of Languages, as of\r\n_Hebrew_, _Syriack_, _Arabick_, _Greek_ and _Latin_, or any other\r\nLanguage that has been so long Written, may be as much differing from\r\nwhat it was 2000 Years since, as an Arbitrary one now invented, and\r\ngrounded on the Letters, might possibly be. And such an arbitrary\r\nPronunciation if generally agreed upon might serve _as well_ for a\r\nhelp to learn the signification of Words, or _Word Combinations_ of\r\nCharacters, as if we now knew the exact primitive Pronunciations,\r\nas critically as the _Masorethæ_ are said to have done that of the\r\n_Hebrew_; and possibly also a _much better_, for that by such a one\r\na great many irregularities and difficulties of Pronunciation (which\r\nare to be found in all Languages now spoken) might be omitted, and the\r\nwhole made exactly regular and easie, as might be shewn in the _Hebrew_\r\nand _Greek_, and especially in the _Arabick_, whose difficulties are\r\nsufficiently manifested by _Alphabetum Arabicum_, Printed at _Rome_\r\n1592. Now as by such a Language the Character might be made effable\r\nwithout Musical Tones or difficult Aspirations, so had we Dictionaries\r\nof the signification of the Characters, we might as soon learn the\r\n_Chinese_ Characters, as we can _Latin_, or any other Language to be\r\nlearn'd by Book, and not by speaking.\r\n\r\n                              IMPRIMATUR,\r\n\r\n                                            _John Hoskyns_ Vice P.

This\r\nDesire of the Royal Society, as I believe, it hinted at a Summary\r\nDelineation, which might be perform'd by a Man qualifi'd in a few Days,\r\ntaking his own opportunity for the avoiding much Expence, (which you\r\nknow they are never able to bear:) So I cannot but think Mr. _Flower_\r\nconceived it to be a Business much easier to perform than he found\r\nit upon the Place, where he Spent a great deal of Time and Mony, and\r\ndying Suddainly after, left his Draughts and Papers dispersed in\r\nseveral Hands, one part whereof you have here, the rest its hoped may\r\nin some Time be recovered, if Sir _John Chardin_'s exact and accurate\r\nPublication of the entire Work do not put a period to all further\r\nCuriosity, which I heartily wish.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _An Exact Draught or Copy of the several Characters engraven in\r\n    Marble at the Mountains of _Nocturestand_ and _Chahelminar_ in\r\n    _Persia_, as they were taken in _November 1667._ By Mr. _S.\r\n    Flower_._\r\n\r\n_N_ 1. _N_ 2. These two Characters are engraven on the Breast of two\r\nHorses cut out of the Mountain of Black Marble at _Nocturestand_,\r\ndistant a League from _Chahelmanare_, or the Ancient _Persepolis_, one\r\nwhereof is said to be _Alexander_'s, the other _Rustram_'s, (a Famous\r\nHero supposed to have lived about the time of _Cambises_.) Mr. _Fl._\r\n\r\n_N_ 1. This Character hath some Similitude with the Ancient Hebrew,\r\nbut the _Persians_ would have it their own, tho' they understand not a\r\nLetter.

Mr. _F._\r\n\r\nIt seems written from the Left Hand to the Right, and to consist of\r\nPyramids, diversly posited, but not joined together. As to the Quantity\r\nof the Inscriptions, _Herbert_ reckon'd in one large Table Twenty Lines\r\nof a Prodigious Breadth. Of this sort here are distinct Papers each of\r\nseveral Lines.\r\n\r\n_N_ 6. This Character is likewise Engraved at _Persepolis_, of the like\r\nAntiquity with the former.

As to the Cockles\r\nof the _Caspian_ Sea, and from the Mouth of _Wolga_, I have advice\r\nfrom _Moscou_, that they are expected there this Winter: Mean while I\r\nherewith send you some _Snail-Shells_, taken out of the River _Jaute_,\r\nnot far from the City of _Moscou_. Our Apothecaries make use of them\r\npowdered, and probably for the same purpose as _Crabs-Eyes_. There\r\nare some others likewise which are found in the Rivers of _Moscou_\r\nand _Neglina_, and in the _Wolga_. Since you have been pleased to\r\ncommunicate to me an Inscription found at _Persepolis_, I thought it\r\nwould be acceptable to send you the Draughts of part of the Ruins of\r\nthe Stone-work of that proud Palace, given me by the Person himself\r\nthat drew them upon the place. I should be much satisfied had I any\r\nthing worthy of your Curiosity and the Publick, which you so often\r\noblige with your Discoveries, which justly merit mine and the Thanks of\r\nall that esteem them as much as my self, who am the Cherisher of your\r\nFriendship, and desirous to shew that I am,\r\n\r\n  _SIR_,\r\n\r\n                _Your most Humble and Obedient Servant_,\r\n\r\n                                                              N. Witsen.\r\n\r\n    _Amsterdam_,\r\n  _Jan. 1. 1694._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _A Description of the Diamond-mines, as it was presented by the\r\n    Right Honourable the Earl Marshal of _England_, to the _R.\r\n    Society_._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parts of the World known to contain _Diamonds_, are the Island\r\n_Borneo_, and the Continent of _India extra & intra Gangem_: _Pegu_\r\nis likewise reported to have several; but the King not potent, his\r\nCountry being but thinly inhabited, contents himself with his Mines\r\nof _Rubies_, _Saphires_, _Topasses_, _Emeralds_, _Gold_, _Silver_,\r\n_Brass_, _Tinn_ and _Lead_, and several other Commodities his Country\r\naffords, in great plenty, rather than to suffer new enquiries to be\r\nmade, lest the Discovery of such an additional Treasure should invite\r\nsome of his Neighbours, more potent to invade him. But leaving the\r\ndescription of other Places to those that know them better, I shall\r\nonly keep my self to the Coast of _Coromandel_, with which I am\r\nacquainted, and having visited several of its Mines, am able to say\r\nsomething thereof Experimentally.\r\n\r\nThe Diamond-Mines in these parts are generally adjacent to Rocky-hills,\r\nor Mountains, whereof begins a great Ledge or Range near _Cape\r\nComorin_, extending in Breadth about 50 _English_ Miles, some\r\nconjoyning, others scatter'd: and running thence in length quite\r\nthrough _Bengula_. In, among, and near these Hills, in several places,\r\nare known to be (as its believed most of them have) Mines; many of\r\nthem are possessed by petty Princes, or _Rajaes_, of the _Hundues_;\r\nsome driven thither for shelter by the _Mores_, who have taken the\r\ngreatest part of their Country from them; others never overcome, as the\r\n_Rajaes_, on the Hills in and near _Bengala_, who admit of little or no\r\nCommerce with their Neighbours, or passage through their Country, which\r\n(being Barren, in few Places affording good Water, the ways craggy and\r\nvery toilsome, especially to an Army) the _Moors_ covet not, but let\r\nthem enjoy it peaceably; yet to prevent danger, they forbid digging (as\r\nthe King of _Pegu_ does) or dig some few Mines only very privately, so\r\nthat a great part of the Mines are unsearcht and concealed. But the\r\nKingdoms of _Golconda_ and _Visiapore_ contain in them scope enough\r\nof ground, known to have Mines sufficient to furnish all the World\r\nplentifully with Diamonds; but their Kings permit digging only in some\r\nPlaces appointed, lest, as it is imagined, they should become too\r\ncommon; and withal for fear of tempting the threatening greatness of\r\n_Aurenge Zebe_; forbidding also those Places that afford the largest\r\nStones, or else keeping workmen in them for their own private uses: So\r\nthat but a very small quantity (in Comparison of what might be) and\r\nthose only of ordinary Size, are found.\r\n\r\nIn the Kingdom of _Golconda_ (as near as I can gather from the best\r\nacquainted) are 23 Mines now employed, or that have been so lately,\r\nviz. _Quolure_, _Codawillicul_, _Malabar_, _Buttephalem_, _Ramiah_,\r\n_Gurem_, _Muttampellee_, _Currure_, _Ganjeeconeta_, _Luttawaar_,\r\n_Jonagerree_, _Pirai_, _Dugulle_, _Purwillee_, _Anuntapelle_,\r\n_Girrogeta_, _Maarmood_, _Wazzergerre_, _Munnemurg_, _Langumboot_,\r\n_Whootoor_, _Muddemurg_, and _Melwillee_ or the New Mine.\r\n\r\n_Quoloure_ was the first Mine made use of in this Kingdom. The Earth\r\nis something Yellowish, not unlike the Colour of our Gravel dried; but\r\nwhiter in some Places where it abounds with smooth Pebbles, much like\r\nsome of those that come out of our Gravel-pits in _England_. They use\r\nto find great quantities in the Vein, if it may properly be so called,\r\nthe Diamonds not lying in continued Clusters as some imagine, but\r\nfrequently so very scattering that sometimes in the space of ¼ of an\r\nAcre of Ground, digged between two or three fathoms Deep, there hath\r\nbeen nothing found; especially in the Mines that afford great Stones,\r\nlying near the superficies of the Earth, and about three Fathoms deep;\r\ndeeper they could not dig for Water; it being in a Vale near a River.\r\nIn other places the Earth is mixt with rugged Stones, where they seldom\r\nmine deeper, though in higher ground, before the Colour of the Earth\r\nalters, and the Vein ceases; which they give a guess at by the small\r\nStones they find in the Earth, the principal Guide they have in the\r\ndiscovery of the Mines.\r\n\r\nThe Diamonds found in these Mines are generally well-shaped, many of\r\nthem pointed, and of a good lively white Water; but it also produces\r\nsome _Yellow_ ones, some _Brown_, and of other colours. They are of\r\nordinary sizes, from about six in a _Mangelin_[18] (of which they find\r\nbut few) to five or six _Mangelins_, each; some of 10, 15, 20. they\r\nfind but rarely. They have frequently a bright and transparent skin,\r\ninclining to a greenish Colour, though the heart of the Stone be purely\r\nwhite; but the Veins of these Mines are almost worn out.\r\n\r\nThe Mines of _Codawillicul_, _Malabar_, and _Buttepallam_ consist of a\r\nreddish Earth, inclining to an Orange-colour (with which it stains the\r\nCloaths of the Labourers that work in it) they dig about four Fathom\r\ndeep. They afford Stones generally of an excellent Water and crystaline\r\nSkin; smaller sizes than those of _Quoloure_, _Ramiah_, _Gurem_, and\r\n_Muttampelleo_; have a Yellowish Earth, like _Quolure_; their Stones\r\nlike those of the two former Mines, but mixt with many of a blue Water.\r\nThese five Mines being under the same Government with _Melwillee_,\r\nwhere the Governour resides; He to draw the Adventurers and Merchants\r\nnear him, that he may be better informed of the Actions and Advantages,\r\nand know the better how to Fleece them, the general practice of\r\nGovernours in these parts, has very lately forbid their use; and\r\ncommanded all to repair to his Residence, which they must obey, or fly\r\ninto another Government.\r\n\r\nThe next Mine in our way is _Currure_, the most famous of them all and\r\nmost Ancient.\r\n\r\nIt has been under Subjection of the King of _Golconda_; but about\r\n25 Years, taken, with the Country of _Rarnaticum_, from the\r\n_Hendue-Rajaes_, about that time, by the _Nabob_, _Meer Jumla_. In it\r\nhave been found Diamonds of a _size_ weight, which is about 9 Ounces\r\n_Troy_ or 81½ _Pago's_ weight. It is only employed by the King for\r\nhis own private use: The Diamonds that are found in it, are very well\r\nspread, large Stones (it yields few or none small,) they have generally\r\na bright Skin, which inclines to a pale Greenish colour, but within are\r\npurely white. The Soil is Reddish as many of the others.\r\n\r\nAbout sixty or seventy years ago, when it was under the Government of\r\nthe _Hundues_, and several Persons permitted to adventure in digging,\r\na _Portugeez_ Gentleman went thither from _Goa_, and having spent in\r\nMining a great sum of Mony to the amounts of 100000 _Pago's_, as 'tis\r\nreported, and converted every thing he brought with him, that would\r\nfetch any mony, even to what wearing Cloaths he could spare, while the\r\nMiners were at Work for the last Days expence, he had prepared a cup of\r\nPoison, resolving, if that Night he found nothing, to drink his last\r\nwith the conclusion of his Mony; but in the Evening the Workmen brought\r\nhim a very fair spread Stone of 20 _Pago's_ weight, in commemoration\r\nwhereof he caused a great Stone to be erected in the place, with an\r\nInscription ingraven on it, in the _Hundues_ or _Tellinga_ Tongue, to\r\nthe following effect, which remains to be seen to this day;\r\n\r\n    _Your Wife and Children sell, sell what you have,\r\n    Spare not your Cloaths, nay, make your self a Slave;\r\n    But money get, then to _CURRURE_ make hast;\r\n    There search the Mines, a Prize you'll find at last._\r\n\r\nAfter which he immediately returned with his Stone to _Goa_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNot far from _Currure_ are the Mines of _Lattawaar_ and _Ganjeconta_,\r\nwhich are in the same Soil as _Currure_, and afford Stones not unlike:\r\nBut _Lattawaar_ hath many representing the great end of a Razor-blade,\r\nthin on one side and thick on the other, very white and of an excellent\r\nWater; but the best of the Mine is worn out, and _Ganjeconta_ employed\r\nonly to the Kings private use.\r\n\r\n_Jonagerre_, _Pirai Dugulle_, _Purwillee_ and _Anuntapellee_, consist\r\nalso of Red earth, are now employed, and afford many large Stones;\r\npart of them of a greenish Water, but the most absolute Mines are of\r\n_Wazzergerre_ and _Munnemurg_, (the other rather representing Pits\r\nthan Mines;) for there they sink through high Rocks till they go so\r\nfar below their basis, that they can go no further for Water, in some\r\nplaces 40 or 50 Fathom deep. The superficies of the Rocks consist of\r\nhard, firm, white Stone, into which they cut a Pit like a Well, of\r\nabout 4 or 5, in some places 6 Foot deep, before they come to a crust\r\nof a Mineral Stone, like the Mineral of Iron; when they fill the Hole\r\nwith Wood and keep as hot a Fire as they can there for two or three\r\nDays, till they think it sufficiently heated; then they pour-in Water\r\ntill they have quencht it, which also slacks and mollifies both Stone\r\nand Mineral; both being cold, they dig again, take out all the crumbled\r\nstuff and dig up what they can besides, before they heat it anew; the\r\nCrust seldom is thicker than three or four Foot, which ceasing, they\r\ncome to a Vein of Earth, that usually runs under the Rock two or three\r\nFurlongs; sometimes much further: This they dig all out and search, and\r\nif their first attempt prove successful, they go to Work again (digging\r\nafter the same manner) as deep as they can, till they come to Water;\r\nfor the drawing whereof, wanting the help of Engins, known in _Europe_,\r\nthey can go no deeper, although the Vein lie lower; all lumps of the\r\nMineral they break in pieces, and frequently find Diamonds enclosed\r\nin them. To Work on these Mines is very expensive, but the advantage\r\nis commonly answerable; yet in respect of the certain disburse, that\r\nmust be before any thing be found, they are not so much frequented\r\nas others, where they may try their Fortunes with a smaller Stock.\r\nThe Earth they dig out is Red: Many large Stones are found here; the\r\nsmallest about 6 in a _Mangelleen_. They are mixt Waters, but the\r\ngreatest part good, only of ill-favoured shapes, many cragged pieces of\r\nStones, some as if they had been parts of very great ones, others with\r\npieces broken off them; yet I never heard of any that ever found two\r\nseeming fellows, although they do those that look as if they had been\r\nnewly Broken.\r\n\r\nIn _Langumboot_ they dig as they do at _Wazzergerree_ and _Munnemurg_;\r\nthe Rock is not altogether so solid, but the Earth and Stones it\r\nproduces much alike.\r\n\r\n_Wootoor_ should have been placed next to _Currure_, it lying near\r\nit, and affording Stones of a like magnitude, shapes and waters; 'tis\r\nemployed only to the Kings use: And singular, in that its Diamonds are\r\nfound in black Earth.\r\n\r\n_Muddemurg_ far exceeds all the rest for Diamonds of a delicate Shape,\r\nWater, and bright transparent Skin, Proud, as it were, in discovering\r\ntheir inward Beauties, with which no other Mine can compare; yet it has\r\nalso store of Veiny ones, but those likewise of so curious Shape and\r\nWater, that its difficult to discover them from the good, especially\r\nthe small ones. It produces Stones of divers Magnitudes, from ten\r\nand twelve in a _Mangelleen_, to six or seven _Mangelleens_ each,\r\nand besides, some great ones. The Earth is Red, but its seated in\r\nthe Woods, and the Water so bad, that to all (except the People Bred\r\nthere) it presently occasions Fevers and destroys abundance, insomuch\r\nthat most of the Adventurers have forsaken it; notwithstanding which\r\nit hath been more profitable than any of the rest, the Vein frequently\r\nlying near the superficies of the Earth, seldom running deep, and is\r\nbetter furnisht than any other yet discover'd. The River _Kishna_, of\r\nexcellent waters, is but 9 Miles distant; but the Miners or Merchants\r\nare either poor that they cannot, or else over-awed by the Governour,\r\npretend to be and dare not be at the charges of fetching their Water\r\nfrom thence. Divers are of the opinion, that, besides the Water, the\r\nTown lying in a bottom, environ'd with Hills and Morass adjoyning, the\r\nAir may be infected, and contribute to its unhealthfulness.\r\n\r\n_Melwillee_ or the _New Mine_, so called, because it was but lately\r\nfound out (or at least permitted to be made use of) in the Year 1670.\r\nit had then a Year employed the Miners, but it was forbidden, and lay\r\nunoccupied till 1673, when complaint being made at _Quoleur_, that\r\nthe Vein was worn out, the King again licensed its settlement. The\r\nEarth they Mine in, is very red, and many of the Stones found there,\r\nhave of it sticking to them, as if it had clung there while they were\r\nof a soft glutinous Substance, and had not attained their hardness,\r\nmaintaining its Colour on its Skin (seeming to be roughened with\r\nit) that it cannot be fetch'd out by grinding on a rough Stone with\r\nSand, which they make use of to clean them. The Stones are generally\r\nwell-shaped, their size from 5 or 6 in a _mangelleen_ to those of 14 or\r\n15 each, and some bigger; but greatest quantities of the middle sorts:\r\nMost of them have a thick dull Skin, incline to a yellowish Water, not\r\naltogether so strong and lively as of the other Mines; very few of them\r\nof a crystaline Water and Skin. They are reported to be apt to flaw in\r\nsplitting, which occasions these People to esteem them something softer\r\nthan the Product of many of the other Mines: Several that flatter by\r\ntheir seeming whiteness when rough, discover their deceitfulness\r\nhaving past the Mill, and too often a yellowish Tincture, to the\r\ndisappointment and loss of them that have cut them; but what they\r\nwant in goodness, is in part supplied by the plenty they find, which,\r\ntogether with their properties, make them the cheaper. This being what\r\nI have gathered, both by Experience of several of the places I have\r\nseen, and the best Informations I could meet with, of the Mines in this\r\nKingdom; I shall now proceed to those in _Visiapore_.\r\n\r\n_Visiapore_ is known to contain Mines enclosing Stones as large and\r\ngood as those of _Golconda_; but the King, for Reasons already given,\r\nmakes use but of the meanest: Whereby, as _Golconda_ is famous for the\r\nlargeness of those it affords, _Visiapore_ is noted for the smallest;\r\nwhose Mines, though they seldom or never render an Adventurer a Fortune\r\nor Estate at once, as sometimes those of _Golconda_ do, by a great\r\nStone or several found together; yet they are more Populous and better\r\nemployed, the small Stones lying thicker in the Earth, so that the\r\ngenerality are gainers, and few but they get their Expence; whereas\r\nthose of _Golconda_ dig away a considerable Estate and find nothing,\r\nothers not their Charges, and where one is a gainer, divers lose.\r\n\r\nThere are 15 Mines employed in the Kingdom of _Visiapore_, viz.\r\n_Ramulconeta_, _Banugunnapellee_, _Pendekull_, _Moodawarum_,\r\n_Cumerwillee_, _Paulkull_, _Workull_, _Lungeepoleur_, _Pootloor_,\r\n_Punchelingull_, _Shingarrampent_, _Tondarpaar_, _Gundepellee_, _Donee_\r\nand _Gazerpellee_.\r\n\r\nIn _Ramulconeta_ Mines in red Earth, about 15 or 16 Foot deep, they\r\nseldom find a Diamond of a _mangelleen_ weight, but small to 20 or\r\n30 in a _mangelleen_. They are generally of an excellent Crystalline\r\nWater, have a bright clear Skin, inclining frequently to a pale\r\ngreenish Colour, are well shaped, but few of them, pointed ones. There\r\nare also found among them several broken pieces of Diamonds, by the\r\nCountry People called _Shemboes_.\r\n\r\nIn _Banugunnapellee_, _Pendekull_, and _Moodawarum_, they dig as at\r\n_Ramulconeta_, and in the same kind of Earth; they also afford Stones\r\nmuch alike, being neighbouring Places.\r\n\r\n_Cummerwillee_, _Paulkull_, and _Workull_, are not far distant, produce\r\nStones much alike out of the same coloured Earth, but very small ones\r\neven to a hundred in a _mangelleen_.\r\n\r\n_Lungepoleur_ Mines are of a yellowish Earth (like those of _Quoleur_,)\r\nits Diamonds are generally well shaped, globular, few pointed, of a\r\nvery good Crystalline Water and bright Skins; many of them have a thick\r\ndark Grass-green Skin, some spotted also with Black, that they seem all\r\nfoul, yet are not so, but within purely white and clean. Their sizes\r\nare from 2 or 3 _mangelleens_ downwards, but few very small.\r\n\r\n_Pootloor_ Mines are of reddish Earth, but afford Stones much like\r\nthose of _Lungepoleur_, only smaller, under a _mangelleen_; the general\r\nsizes are of ½, ⅓, ¼, ⅙ of a _mangelleen_.\r\n\r\n_Punchelingull_, _Shingarrampent_, and _Tondarpaar_, are also of red\r\nEarth, their Diamonds not unlike those of _Quoleur_, only rarely or\r\nnever any large ones are found there.\r\n\r\n_Gundepellee_ hath the same Earth with the former, and produces Stones\r\nof equal Magnitude; but frequently of a pure Crystalline Water, wherein\r\nthey exceed the former.\r\n\r\n_Donee_ and _Gazerpellee_ dig both in red Earth likewise, and afford\r\nStones alike, the greatest part whereof are of good Shapes and Waters.\r\nThey have also many _Shemboes_, and some of bad Waters, some brown,\r\nwhich these People call soft or weak water'd, being esteemed of a\r\nsofter and weaker Body than others, by reason they have not so much\r\nLife, when cut, and are subject to flaw in splitting, and on the Mill;\r\ntheir general Product is in Stones of middle Sizes: But _Gazerpellee_\r\nhas besides many large ones, and is the only Mine noted for such in the\r\nKingdom of _Visiapore_. With which concluding the description of the\r\nMines, I shall give some Account how the Diamonds are found, and how\r\nthey handle the Earth to find them; which is as followeth.\r\n\r\nThe Diamonds are so scatter'd and dispersed in the Earth, and lie\r\nso thin, that in the most plentiful Mines it's rare to find one in\r\ndigging, or till they have prepar'd the Stuff, and do search purposely\r\nfor them: They are also frequently enclos'd in Clods; and some of those\r\nof _Melwillee_, the New Mine in the Kingdom of _Golconda_, have the\r\nEarth so fix'd about them, that till they grind them on a rough Stone\r\nwith Sand, they cannot move it sufficiently, to discover they are\r\nTransparent; or, were it not for their Shapes, to know them from other\r\nStones. At the first opening of the Mine, the unskilful Labourers,\r\nsometimes to try what they have found, lay them on a great Stone, and\r\nstriking on them with another, to their costly experience discover\r\nthey had broken a Diamond. One I knew who had an excellent Stone of 8\r\n_mangelleens_, served so by ignorant Miners he employed.\r\n\r\nNear the Place where they dig, they raise a Wall with such rugged\r\nStones as they find at Hand (whereof all the Mines afford Plenty) of\r\nabout two Foot high, and six Foot over, flooring it well with the\r\nsame; for the laying of which they have no other Mortar than the Earth\r\ntempered with Water. To strengthen and make it tight they throw up a\r\nBank against the side of it: In one whereof they leave a small vent\r\nabout two Inches from the bottom, by which it empties it self into a\r\nlittle Pit, made in the Earth to receive small Stones, if by chance any\r\nshould run through. The vent being stopped, they fill the Cistern they\r\nhave made with Water, soaking therein as much as the Earth they dig\r\nout of the Mines, as it can conveniently receive at a time, breaking\r\nthe Clods, picking out the great Stones and stirring it with Shovels,\r\ntill the Water is all Muddy, the gravelly stuff falling to the bottom;\r\nthen they open the vent, letting out the foul Water and supplying\r\nit with clean, till all the Earthly Substance be wasted away, and\r\nnone but a gravelly remains at the bottom. Thus they continue Washing\r\ntill about Ten of the Clock before Noon, when they take the gravelly\r\nStuff they have washed, and spread it on a Place made plain and smooth\r\n(like a Bowling-Alley) for the purpose, near the Cistern, which being\r\nsoon dried by the heat of the Sun at that time of the Day, they very\r\ncuriously look it over, that the smallest bit of a Stone can hardly\r\nescape them. They never examin the Stuff they have wash'd but between\r\nthe Hours of Ten and Three, least any Cloud by interposing, intercept\r\nthe brisk Beams of the Sun, which they hold very necessary to assist\r\nthem in their search; the Diamonds, not forbearing to reflect them when\r\nthey touch therein, rendring themselves thereby the more conspicuous.\r\n\r\nSome of the expertest Labourers are employed in searching; he that\r\nsets them at Work usually sitting by, and overlooking; but it's\r\nhardly possible, especially where many are employed, to watch them\r\nso narrowly, but that they may steal part of what they find, as many\r\ntimes some of them do, and, selling it privately, convert to their own\r\nuse. If they find a large Stone, they carry it not presently to their\r\nEmployer, but keep on looking, having an Eye on him till they observe\r\nhe takes notice of it, when with a turn of their Hand they give him a\r\nglimpse of it, but deliver it not till they have done Work, and then\r\nvery privately, it being the general Endeavour to conceal what they\r\nfind, least it should come to the Knowledge of the Governour of the\r\nPlace, and he require a share, which in the Kingdom of _Golconda_ is\r\nusually practiced, without respect to any agreement made with them.\r\n\r\nThe Miners, those that employ them, and the Merchants that buy the\r\nStones of them, are generally _Ethnicks_; not a _Musselman_, that\r\never I heard of, followed the Employment. These Labourers and their\r\nEmployers are _Tellinga_'s, commonly Natives of or near the Place. The\r\nMerchants are the _Banians_ of _Guzzarat_, who for some Generations\r\nhave forsaken their own Country to take up the Trade, in which they\r\nhave had such Success, that 'tis now solely engross'd by them; who\r\ncorresponding with their Country-men in _Surrat_, _Goa_, _Golconda_,\r\n_Visiapore_, _Agra_ and _Dillee_, and other Places in _India_, furnish\r\nthem all with Diamonds.\r\n\r\nThe Governors of the Mines are also Idolaters: In the King of\r\n_Golconda_'s Dominions a _Tellinga Brammee_ Rents most of them, whose\r\nagreement with the Adventurer is, that, all the Stones they find under\r\na[19]_Pagoda_ Weight, are to be their own; all of that Weight and\r\nabove it to be his, for the King's Use: But although this Agreement be\r\nsigned and sealed unto, he minds not at all the Performance thereof,\r\nbut endeavours to engross all the Profit to himself, by Tyrannical\r\nsqueezing both Merchants and Miners, whom he not only Taxes very high,\r\nbut maintaining Spies among them of their own People, on the least\r\nInkling that they have been any ways Fortunate, he immediately makes a\r\nDemand on them, and raises their Tax; else, on a false Pretence they\r\nhave found a great Stone, drubs them till they Surrender what they\r\nhave, to redeem their Bodies from Torment. Besides, the Excise is so\r\nhigh on all sorts of Provisions, _Beetle_, and _Tobacco_, which to\r\nthem is as absolutely necessary as Meat, or at least in their Esteem,\r\nthat it is thereby raised to double that Price they bear without the\r\nGovernment; and it is furnish'd only by some Licens'd Persons; if any\r\nother should endeavour to bring in the least quantity by stealth, he\r\nis Fin'd (even for one Leaf of _Tobacco_) if it be a Person of any\r\nRepute, or worth any thing, else very severely drubb'd for it; by which\r\nCourse there is hardly a Man worth five Hundred Pound to be found among\r\nthem, most of them dealing by Monies taken up at Interest of Usurers,\r\nwho reside there purposely to furnish them, who, with the Governor eat\r\nup their Gains: So that one would wonder any of them should stay, and\r\nnot betake themselves to Places where they might have better Usage;\r\nas there are several in other Governments, and some few that have the\r\nSense to remove; but many their Debts, others hopes of a great hit,\r\ndetains. Both Merchant and Miner go generally naked, only a poor Clout\r\nabout their middle, and their Shash on their Heads; they dare not wear\r\na Coat, lest the Governor should say they have thriven much, are Rich,\r\nand so enlarge his Demands on them. The Wisest, when they find a great\r\nStone, conceal it till they have an opportunity, and then with Wife\r\nand Children run all away into the _Visiapore_ Country, where they are\r\nsecure.\r\n\r\nThe Government in the _Visiapore_ Country is better, their Agreement\r\nobserv'd, Taxes easier, and no such Impositions on Provisions; the\r\nMerchants go handsomly Clad, among whom are several Persons of\r\nconsiderable Estates, which they are permitted to enjoy peaceably, by\r\nreason whereof their Mines are much more Populous and better employed\r\nthan those of _Golconda_.\r\n\r\nIt is observable, that notwithstanding the Agreement with the\r\nAdventurers of the Mines, that all Stones above a certain Weight shall\r\nbe for the King's Use; yet in the Metropolis of either Kingdoms, as\r\nthe Cities of _Golconda_ and _Visiapore_ are, there is no seizure, all\r\nStones are free, and the late deceased King, _Abdull Cutopshaw_ of the\r\nformer, and _Edelshaw_ of the latter, would not only give very great\r\nPrices for large Stones, but richly Vest, and present the Merchant that\r\nSold them with Horses or something else of Value, thereby encouraging\r\nothers to bring the like. But the present King of _Visiapore_ is a\r\nChild, and the King of _Golconda_'s Delights solely pleased on light\r\nWomen-Dancers, and Trick-Showers, that he neither minds _Diamonds_, nor\r\nmany things more necessary, committing the Government of his Kingdom to\r\na _Tellinga Braminee_, which the _Musselmen_ not well resenting, does\r\nin some measure threaten the stability of his State.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] _A _Mangelin_ is 4 grains in weight, saith _Linschoten_._\r\n\r\n[19] _A _Pagoda_ weight is _9 Mangelleens_._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _A Letter from the _East Indies_, of Mr. _John Marshal_ to Dr.\r\n    _Coga_, giving an Account of the Religion, Rites, Notions,\r\n    Customs, Manners of the Heathen Priests commonly called\r\n    _Bramines_. Communicated by the Reverend Mr. _Abraham de la\r\n    Pryme_._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Worthy Sir_,\r\n\r\nThe last time that I had the happiness to be in your good Company,\r\nand to partake of those Favours and Blessings that your Goodness\r\nwas pleased liberally to bestow upon me and our Companions, at our\r\ndeparture, and as it were Exile from our Native Land, does so loudly\r\ncall out for some recompence or other at our Hands, that I cannot\r\nwithout the greatest Ingratitude imaginable, let slip this (tho'\r\nsudden) opportunity of Writing unto you, and presenting of you at\r\nthis time with what I understand you more value than all the Riches\r\nof the East; to wit, a few Specimens of the Knowledge of those People\r\nwhom we stile Barbarians, Heathens and Idolaters, which I have read\r\nin their own Books, and gather'd from the mouths of those that have\r\nbeen the greatest Speakers and Preachers among them. I have always had\r\na profound Veneration for the Dictates of Nature, and the universal\r\nTraditions of Nations, for hereby are Infinite Things to be learned,\r\nfor the establishing of our Glorious Religion against Atheists, and the\r\nmore easie propagation of the same among Infidels and Heathens.\r\n\r\nUpon what account or grounds it is that some Travellers have stiled\r\nthese People Polytheists, or Atheists, I cannot tell; or whether there\r\nbe any such People at all in the World, except some of the base common\r\nsort in all Nations, I much question? It is very observable here, that\r\ntheir Priests, or _Bramines_, and Holy Men, whom they call _Jagees_,\r\nwhen they have occasion to Write any thing they always put a figure of\r\none in the first place, to shew, as they say, that they acknowledge\r\nbut one God, whom they say is _Burme_, that is, Immaterial. When they\r\npreach to the People, and Instruct them, which is commonly every\r\nFeast-day, full Moon, or the time of an Eclipse of either Luminary,\r\nthey tell the common People much of God, Heaven and Hell, but very\r\nImperfectly, Obscurely and Mystically. They say that when God thought\r\nof making the World, he made it in a minute.\r\n\r\nThey account this World the Body of God, for all that they say he's\r\nImmaterial; and say that the Highest Heavens are his Head, the Fire\r\nhis Mouth, the Air his Breath and Breast, the Water his Seed, and the\r\nEarth and the foundations thereof his Legs and Feet. But assert in\r\ngeneral that God is the Life of every thing, yet is the thing neither\r\ngreater nor less for him.\r\n\r\nThey hold that God dwelt in a Vacuity before that he created the World,\r\nand that as he dwelt in that Vacuity he created several Beings out of\r\nhimself, the first were Angels, the second Souls, the third Spirits,\r\nall differing in degrees of Purity, the first being more pure than the\r\nsecond, and the second than the third. The Angels, they say, neither\r\nact Good nor Evil, the Souls either Good or Evil, but the Spirits, or\r\n_Dewta's_, as they call them, act scarce any thing but Evil.\r\n\r\nThey have a good Opinion of the Angels, and think their State mighty\r\nhappy, hoping that when they dye they shall be made partakers of the\r\nsame Bliss and Pleasure.\r\n\r\nThey believe that every thing that hath Life hath a Soul, but\r\nespecially Man; and they accordingly affirm, that as these Souls\r\nbehaved themselves in their pre-existent State, so are their Actions\r\nin this World either good or bad, by a sort of fatal Necessity, which\r\nis very hard to conquer, or to overcome. Hence it is, say they, that\r\nthere are so many different Humours and Dispositions of Men, for their\r\nSouls, before their entrance into their Bodies, being tainted with\r\ndifferent Affections, causes the like differences in the Parties,\r\nwhose Bodies are their Vehicles. So that if a Man happen to have a\r\nsuddain or unfortunate Death, they immediately ascribe the same to\r\nthe Party's own Wickedness, or the bad Life that his Soul led before\r\nthat it enter'd into his Body. For, say they, the afore-acted Evil\r\nthat his Soul did in its other Life, brought these accidents upon\r\nhim, by getting the upper hand of him, and by being too powerful and\r\nstrong. And those that dye thus, they believe that their Souls turn\r\nimmediately into Devils. They maintain _Pythagoras_'s Transmigration,\r\nor _Metempsycosis_, but in a grosser sense than he did. For they\r\nbelieve that Mens Souls, that have not lived so well as they ought, go\r\nas soon as the Body dyes not only into Birds and Beasts, but even into\r\nthe basest Reptiles, Insects and Plants, where they suffer a strong\r\nsort of purgation, to expiate their former Crimes: But as for the Souls\r\nof the _Jogees_, or _Fuche's_, that is, of Religious Men and Saints,\r\nthey fancy that they go and inhabit with the good _Dewta_'s, or Angels,\r\namong the Stars.\r\n\r\nAs for the Spirits, or Inferiour Angels, they believe that they are\r\nvery evil, and have a hand in all Wickednesses, Murders, Wars, Storms,\r\nand Tempests; so that when they solemnize the Funerals of those that\r\nare dead, they always present Dishes of Meat, as Offerings unto those\r\nSpirits, and sometimes Sacrifice unto them, that they may not hurt the\r\nSouls of the Dead.\r\n\r\nAs they acknowledge the being of a mighty God, so they hold that he\r\ncreated the World, and every thing therein. They believe that there\r\nare almost infinite number of Worlds, and that God has oftentimes\r\nAnnihilated and Re-Created the same. But how he came first to Create\r\nthe World and Mankind, they relate to have been thus--Once on a time\r\n(say they) as he was set in Eternity, it came into his mind to make\r\nsomething, and immediately no sooner had he thought the same, but that\r\nthe same Minute was a perfect Beautiful Woman present immediately\r\nbefore him, which he called _Adea Suktee_, that is, the first Woman:\r\nThen this figure put into his mind the figure of a Man; which he had\r\nno sooner conceived in his mind, but that he also started up, and\r\nrepresented himself before him; this he called _Manapuise_, that is,\r\nthe first Man; then upon a reflection of these things, he resolv'd\r\nfurther to create several places for them to abide in, and accordingly\r\nassuming a subtil body, he Breath'd in a Minute the whole Universe, and\r\nevery thing therein, from the least to the greatest.\r\n\r\nThey constantly believe that the Universe cannot possibly last longer\r\nthan 71 _Joog's_, which is a measure of time with them, and is ...\r\nyears. Which when it is come, God does not only annihilate the whole\r\nUniverse, but even every thing else, as well Angels, Souls, and\r\nSpirits, as Inferiour Creatures; and then he remains in the same State\r\nthat he was in before the Creation; But say, that after he has a while\r\nrespired thus he Breaths again, and every thing is Created afresh, as\r\nwell Angels and Souls, as all other things; but as for the Spirits,\r\nthey are no more thought of. Yet for all this, after 71 _Joogs_ more\r\nall is Annihilated again. How many _Joogs_ are past since the World\r\nwas last Created they cannot certainly tell; only 'tis observable that\r\nin an Almanack of theirs, written in the _Sanscript_ Language in 1670,\r\nthey make the World then 3892771 years old from its last Creation.\r\n\r\nThe _Bramines_ of _Persia_ tell certain long Stories of a great Giant\r\nthat was led into a most delicate Garden, which upon certain conditions\r\nshould be his own for ever. But one evening in a cool shade, one of the\r\nWicked _Dewta's_, or Spirits, came to him, and tempted him with vast\r\nsums of Gold, and all the most precious Jewels that can be imagined;\r\nbut he courageously withstood that temptation, as not knowing what\r\nvalue or use they were of: But at length this wicked _Dewta_ brought\r\nto him a fair Woman, who so charm'd him, that for her sake he most\r\nwillingly broke all his Conditions, and thereupon was turned out.\r\n\r\nThey tell a great many Stories Absurd and Ridiculous enough, of the\r\nfirst Ages of this present World, which would be too tedious here to\r\ntake notice of; only I shall here give you out of one of their own\r\nBooks what they tell us of a great Flood that formerly happened. They\r\nsay, that about 21000 Years ago the Sea overwhelm'd and drowned the\r\nwhole Earth, except one great Hill, far to the Northwards, called\r\n_Bindd_, and that there fled thither only one Woman and seven Men,\r\nthe names of whom were _Dehoolah_, _Sunnuk_, _Sunnaud_, _Trilleek_,\r\n_Sannotah_, _Cuppyloshaw_, _Suraschah_ and _Burroopung_; these\r\nunderstanding out of their Books that such a Flood would come, and was\r\nthen actually coming, prepared against the same, and repaired thither;\r\nto which place also went two of all sorts of Creatures, Herbs, Trees,\r\nand Grasses, and of every thing that had Life, to the number in all\r\nof 1800000 living Souls. This Flood (say they) lasted 120 Years, 5\r\nMonths and 5 days: After which time all those Creatures that were thus\r\npreserved, descended down again and replenished the Earth: But as for\r\nthe 7 Men and Women, only one of them came down with her, and dwelt at\r\nthe Foot of the Mountain, the other six turned _Fuchee's_, or Holy Men,\r\nand spent there the remainder of their days.\r\n\r\nThey hold in general the _Ptolomaic_ System of the Universe, and say\r\nthat there are 8 or 9 Heavens, counting the Air and Earth, every one\r\nexceeding another in Beauty and Glory.\r\n\r\nTheir Religion consists of nothing that I could ever see or learn, but\r\nthe leading of a Pure Life, the Washing away of their Sins in the River\r\n_Ganges_, their muttering over of divers Prayers, and their doing of\r\nstrange and incredible Penances.\r\n\r\nThey say, that God is such a one, that whosoever seeks him, let it be\r\nafter what manner he pleases, whether by thinking that the Sun is he,\r\nor the Moon, or the like, if they do it but sincerely and honestly,\r\nwith a right affected heart, they shall be received of him.\r\n\r\nThey report, that on a time a _Mussulman_ seeing a _Hindoo_, or\r\nPagan Priest, in Heaven, he ask'd God how that Infidel came to have\r\nadmittance thither, whom _Mahomet_ so often calls by the name of Bitter\r\nRoots? To whom God answered, What if a Bitter Root bring forth sweeter\r\nFruit than any of you, why should I not receive it? Upon which the\r\n_Mussulman_ had no more to say.\r\n\r\nThey hold, that such as suffer not their minds to wander after the\r\nlusts of the World are perfect _Jogees_, or Saints, and hold that God\r\nis always present with them in all their actions.\r\n\r\nIt is to be found in many of their Books, that there was a time, a good\r\nwhile ago, in which God took upon him the shape of a Man, and spent\r\nmany Years in reforming the world, and giving better rules to walk by\r\nthan had been before: but at length having left them, they soon forgot\r\nhim and his Rules, and returned to their former courses; upon which he\r\ntold them that he would leave them to their ways, and never undertake\r\nany such thing again.\r\n\r\nThe Religious at some certain Seasons of the Year come unto the River\r\n_Ganges_ (which they call the Holy River) in vast multitudes, even from\r\nmany parts of _Tartary_, to wash away their sins, and make expiation\r\nfor their faults.\r\n\r\nThis _Ganges_ is a delicate fine River chiefly for the sake of its most\r\nsweet, pure and clear Waters, which have got it the greatest esteem of\r\nany River in the East. I have oftentimes sail'd many Miles up it, and\r\nhave found it in some places not to be above a Mile broad, in others\r\nnot half so much, and in one or two places not above one eighth of a\r\nMile. In _April_, when the Water is at the lowest, it is almost dry in\r\nmany places; but when it is at the highest, which is commonly about the\r\nmiddle of _September_, it is very deep, and many Miles broad.\r\n\r\nWhen the People are here gather'd together, they have a great many\r\nstrange Customs and Ceremonies, and pay a kind of Divine Honour and\r\nWorship to the River, too long and tedious here to mention. The\r\n_Hindoos_ and _Bramines_ preach then every day to the people, teaching\r\nthem their Duties, and ordering them to say such and such Prayers; but\r\nabove all things to be Charitable to the poor and needy.\r\n\r\nIt is reported, that upon the Hills by _Casmere_ there are men that\r\nlive some hundreds of Years, and can hold their Breaths, and lye in\r\nTrances for several Years together, if they be but kept warm; and that\r\nevery year some of them come down unto the People at _Ganges_, and\r\ndo many great Cures; for whom they have such a Veneration, that they\r\nfrequently drink the Water they wash their Sweaty Feet in.\r\n\r\nThe Penances and Austerities that they undergo are almost incredible;\r\nmost of them, through their continual Fastings, and lying upon the\r\nparching hot Sand in the Heat of the Sun, are so Lean, Dry'd and\r\nWither'd, that they look like Skeletons or Shadows, and one can scarce\r\nperceive them to breath, or feel their Pulse beat.\r\n\r\nWhen any great Man dyes among them, but especially any of their\r\n_Jogees_ or Saints, they make great preparations for their Funeral;\r\nthe Corpse is laid on its Belly, and Salt and Rice laid round about it\r\nat every corner of the Ground. Then the nearest Relations to the Party\r\ndeceased carry a Pot of Water on their Shoulders several times about\r\nthe Funeral Pile, when they burn them, then breaking it in pieces,\r\nspills the Water. Which Ceremony being ended, the Pile is fired, and\r\nthen all the Relations begin to howl, and embrace one another, then\r\nwashing themselves in some Neighbouring River, they depart every one\r\nto his Home; and as for the remaining Ashes, if he be Rich they gather\r\nthem up, and cast them into the _Ganges_ or the Sea.\r\n\r\nSometimes it happens that the Wife of the deceased Party, if she have\r\nno Children, and be old, or ill to live in the World, will burn her\r\nself with the dead Body; but this happens very seldom. It is said, that\r\nin such cases the _Bramines_ give the Woman a stupefying Liquor, which\r\nby the time that they are in the Fire makes them senseless of any Pain.\r\n\r\nTo know into what Body the Soul of the deceased is transmigrated they\r\ndo thus; they strew the Ashes of the Dead upon the Place where he\r\nwas first laid after his Death, and handfuls of odoriferous Flowers\r\nabout the same, and returning again in 44 Hours, they judge by some\r\npretended Impression or other in the Ashes, into what Body it is gone:\r\nIf the Foot of an Horse, or Dog, or Ox, or such like appear, then\r\nthey certainly give out that it is gone into such like Creatures; but\r\nif nothing appear, then they think it is certainly gone to the Starry\r\nRegions.\r\n\r\nAs for their Learning and Knowledge it is but little; they have indeed\r\nseveral Books writ in divers Languages, but they contain nothing but a\r\ngreat deal of Stuff and Cant about their Worship, Rites and Ceremonies.\r\n\r\nThey are ignorant of all parts of the World but their own; they wonder\r\nmuch at us, that will take so much Care and Pains, and run thro' so\r\nmany Dangers both by Sea and Land, only, as they say, to uphold and\r\nnourish Pride and Luxury. For, say they, every Country in the whole\r\nWorld is sufficiently endow'd by Nature with every thing that is\r\nnecessary for the Life of Man, and that therefore it is madness to seek\r\nfor, or desire, that which is needless and unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe last time that I was at _Modufferpore_ in _Indostan_, I had a\r\ngreat deal of talk with a _Bramine_ somewhat more Learned than any of\r\nthe rest, his Name was _Ramnaunt_; he told me a great many Secrets in\r\nPhysick, and told me many Traditions and Stories. He says, that if you\r\nbury a piece of Mony for some considerable time in the Mouth of a live\r\nFrog, and then dig it up again at Midnight, that this piece of Money,\r\nto whomsoever you give or pay it, will always return to you again.\r\n\r\nHe says, that if the little Worm in the Wood _Lukerakera_ be cut in\r\ntwo, and the one part stirs and the other not, if the stirring part be\r\nbruised, and given with half a Beetle to a Man, the other half to a\r\nWoman, this Charm will keep them from ever lying absent one from the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThey have Books full of the like absurdities, and Cabalistick\r\ncomplication of Figures; as for Example, if you write these following\r\nNumbers, 28, 35, 2, 7. ---- 6, 3, 32, 31--34, 29, 8, 1, --4, 5, 30, 33.\r\nin the squares of a square Figure, and your Enemies Name under it, and\r\nwear it always about you, your Enemy shall never be able to hurt you.\r\n\r\nSo if you write the following Figures in the like manner upon the\r\nleft Hand, 2, 9, 2, 7, --6, 3, 6, 5, --8, 3, 8, 1--4, 5, 4, 7--with\r\nTurmerick, and wash the same off with fair Water of _Ganges_, and drink\r\nit, it will cure all manner of Venomous Bitings.\r\n\r\nMultitudes of such like ridiculous Fancies they have; all which they\r\nseem to have borrowed from the _Cabala_ of the _Saracens_, which is\r\nfull of such like.\r\n\r\nI lately heard a _Bramine_ say, that if some of the pieces or knots\r\nof the Cloath (in which a Woman hath been burned with her Husband) be\r\nsaved, and made up in the form of a Wick, and fitted for a Lamp, and\r\nlighted, and set in a dead Womans Skull, that it would make the dead\r\nParty appear. This he said he had done, but I did not believe him.\r\n\r\nWhen they have any mad Men among them, they take them and put them into\r\na close Room, just big enough to hold them, and almost Smoke them to\r\nDeath with Musk and cold Smells, which soon brings their Brains into\r\ntheir right temperature, and so recover them, _&c._\r\n\r\nThere happen'd two things in our Voyage hither which I thought very\r\nobservable tho' perhaps they may not be unknown to you--The first was,\r\nthat all our Tornadoes brought much Rain with a stink; and if the\r\nSeamen did but lay their Cloaths by for 24 Hours, they became all full\r\nof little Maggots. The second is, When we came out of _Europe_ we took\r\nin some Water at St. _Jago_'s, and when we were almost at our Journeys\r\nend, our Cooper going with a Candle to open one of the Casks, he had no\r\nsooner done it, but the Water immediatly took Fire, and burnt his Face,\r\nHands and Fingers; but he suddenly turning about quench'd the same, by\r\nsetting his Britch on it. It stunk pretty much also at the same time,\r\nbut afterwards came to its native Sweetness, _&c._\r\n\r\n                                                       _I am yours_, &c.\r\n\r\n                                                            Jo. Marshal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Part of two Letters to the Publisher from Mr. _James Cunningham_,\r\n    F.R.S. and Physician to the _English_ at _Chusan_ in _China_,\r\n    giving an account of his Voyage thither, of the Island of\r\n    _Chusan_, of the several sorts of Tea, of the Fishing,\r\n    Agriculture of the _Chinese_, _&c._ with several Observations not\r\n    hitherto taken notice of._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _SIR_,\r\n\r\nMy last to you was from the Island of _Borneo_, in which I gave you an\r\naccount of our arrival there the 17th of _July_, where we staid but two\r\nDays, the Season of the Year being so far past, and from thence made\r\nthe best of our way through the Streights of _Banca_ with favourable\r\nWinds and Weather, till we came on the Coast of _China_ the 13th of\r\n_August_, then we had variable Winds which carried us abreast of\r\n_Emuy_ the 19th following, at which time the North East Winds setting\r\nin fresh, put us in great fears of losing our passage; whereupon we\r\nwere forced to turn it up against Wind and Current all the Way, the\r\nWeather so favouring us, that we were never but by our Top-sails,\r\nelse we should have lost more Ground in one Day, than we could have\r\ngain'd in eight. The last of _August_ we came to an Anchor under the\r\n_Crocodile_ Islands, both to shelter us from the bad Weather, (which\r\nis generally expected on this Coast at new and full Moon, and has been\r\nfatal to a great many Ships) and also to look for fresh Water, which\r\nwas now grown scarce with us, not having recruited since we came from\r\nthe Cape of _Good Hope_: These are three small Islands lying in the\r\nLatitude of 26 Degrees, about six Leagues from the River of _Hocksieu_;\r\non _two_ whereof we found very good fresh Water, with a convenient\r\nWatering-place on the South West side of the innermost of the _three_;\r\nand by the assistance of a few _Chinese_ Fishermen we procured some\r\nfresh Provisions from the main-land, because we did not reckon it safe\r\nto adventure our selves thither, lest we should have been brought\r\ninto Trouble by the Government there. While we lay here, on the fifth\r\nof _September_ we had a suddain short shift of the Moonsoon to S. W.\r\nthe fury whereof others felt, in coming upon the Coast of _China_ at\r\nthe same time. The 8th of _September_ we put to Sea again, turning to\r\nWindward Night and Day without all the Islands, which are very numerous\r\nalong this Coast, to which we were altogether strangers beyond _Emuy_,\r\nand the Hydrography thereof is hitherto so imperfect, that there was\r\nno trusting to our Drafts, which made our Navigation somewhat more\r\ndangerous: However, on the first of _October_ we got into the Latitude\r\nof 30 Degrees, where we came to an Anchor near the Land, until we found\r\nthe way by Boat to _Chusan_, about 12 Leagues within the Islands; from\r\nwhence we had a Pilot, who carried us safely thither on the 11th of\r\n_October_. Upon this Island the _Chineses_ have granted us a Settlement\r\nand Liberty of Trade, but not to _Ning-po_, which is 6 or 8 hours sail\r\nto the Westward, all the way among Islands; this being the largest,\r\nis 8 or 9 Leagues in length from East to West, and 4 or 5 Leagues\r\nin breadth; about 3 Leagues from that point of the Main-Land called\r\nCape _Liampo_ by the _Portugueze_, but _Khi-tu_ by the _Chinese_: At\r\nthe West End of this Island is the Harbour very safe and convenient,\r\nwhere the Ships ride within call of the Factory, which is built close\r\nby the shore on a low plain Valley, with near 200 Houses about it for\r\nthe Benefit of Trade; inhabited by Men, whose Jealousie has not as yet\r\npermitted them to let their Wives dwell here; for the Town where they\r\nare, is ¾ of a Mile further from the Shore, enviorn'd with a fine Stone\r\nWall, about 3 Miles in Circumference, mounted with 22 square Bastions\r\nplaced at irregular distances, besides 4 great Gates, on which are\r\nplanted a few old Iron Guns, seldom or never used: The Houses within\r\nare very meanly built: Here the _Chumpeen_ or Governour of the Island\r\nlives, and betwixt three and four thousand beggarly Inhabitants, most\r\npart Souldiers and Fishermen; for the Trade of this place being newly\r\ngranted, has not as yet brought any considerable Merchants hither. The\r\nIsland in general abounds with all sorts of Provisions, such as Cows,\r\nBuffalo's, Goats, Deer, Hogs wild and tame, Geese, Ducks and Hens;\r\nRice, Wheat, Calavances, Cole-worts, Turnips, Potatoes, Carrots, Beetes\r\nand Spinach; But for Merchandize there's none but what comes from\r\n_Ning-po_, _Hang-cheu_, _Nankin_ and the Inland Towns, some of which I\r\nhope to see, when I have acquir'd a little of the _Chinese_ Language.\r\nHere also the Tea grows in great plenty on the tops of the Hills, but\r\nit is not in that esteem with what grows on more Mountainous Islands.\r\nAltho this Island is pretty well stor'd with People, yet its far from\r\nwhat it was in _F. Martinius_'s time, when he describes _Cheuxan_:\r\nand this puts me in mind, that the Superstitious Pilgrimages thereto,\r\nmention'd by him, must be meant of the Island _Pou-to_, which lies 9\r\nLeagues from hence, and 3 Miles to the Eastward of this Island, whither\r\n(they say) the Emperour designs in the Month of _May_ next (being\r\nhis Birth-day, and the 40th Year of his Age) to come to worship in\r\nan Ancient Pagoda there, famous for Sanctity; having sent one of his\r\n_Bonzes_ already thither to get all things in order.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           _Chusan_, _Novemb. 22. 1701._\r\n\r\n  _SIR_,\r\n\r\nI formerly told you, that the Emperor design'd to have come to the\r\nIsland of _Pou-to_ (a place of great Devotion) to worship in the Month\r\nof _May_ last, being the 40th Year of his Age, I should have said of\r\nhis Reign; but all things being prepared there for his Reception, he\r\nwas dissuaded from his purpose by some of his _Mandarines_, who made\r\nhim believe that the terrible Thunder there was very dangerous. This\r\n_Pou-to_ is a small Island about 5 Leagues round at the East end of\r\nthis Island, famous for the Superstitious Pilgrimages made thither for\r\nthe space of eleven hundred Years: It's inhabited only by _Bonzes_,\r\nto the number of 3000, all of the Sect call'd _Hoshang_, or unmarried\r\n_Bonzes_, who live a _Pythagorean_ Life; and there they have built 400\r\nPagodes, two whereof are considerable for their greatness and finery,\r\nbeing lately covered with green and yellow Tiles brought from the\r\nEmperor's Palace at _Nankin_, and inwardly adorn'd with stately Idols\r\nfinely grav'd and gilded, the chief whereof is the Idol _Quon-em_. To\r\nthese two great Pagodes belong two chief Priests, who govern all the\r\nrest. They have several Ways and Avenues cut through the Island, some\r\nwhereof are pav'd with Flag-stones, and over-shaded with Trees planted\r\non each side: Their dwellings are the best I have yet seen in these\r\nParts. All which are maintain'd by Charitable Devotions; and the\r\nJunks which go from _Ning-po_ and this place to _Japan_, touch there\r\nboth going and coming, to make their Offerings for their good Success.\r\nThere is another Island call'd _Kim-tong_ 5 Leagues hence in the way\r\nto _Ning-po_, whither, they say, do retire a great many _Mandarins_\r\nto live a quiet Life after they have given over their Employments; on\r\nthat Island also are said to be Silver Mines, but prohibited to be\r\nopen'd. The rest of the circumjacent Islands are either desert, or\r\nmeanly inhabited by a few fishing People, but all of them stor'd with\r\nabundance of Deer. For it is not long since this Island of _Chusan_\r\nbegan to be Peopled; it's true, in _Martini_'s Days, about 50 Years\r\nago, it was very Populous for the space of three or four Years, at\r\nwhich time the fury of the _Tartarian_ Conquest was so great, that\r\nthey left it desolate, not sparing so much as the Mulberry Trees (for\r\nthen they made a great deal of raw Silk here) and in this condition\r\nit continued till about 18 Years ago, that the Walls of the Fort or\r\nTown, which now is, were built by the Governor of _Ting-hai_, for a\r\nGarrison to expel some Pyrats, who had taken shelter here. About 14\r\nYears ago, the Island beginning to be peopled, there was a _Chumpeen_\r\nor General sent to govern it for three Years, to whom succeeded the\r\nlate _Chumpeen_ (who procur'd the opening of this Port to Strangers)\r\nwhose Government continued till _April_ last, being translated to be\r\n_Chumpeen_ of _Tien-cing Wei_ near to _Pekin_, and was succeeded by the\r\npresent _Chumpeen_, who is Son to the Old _Chunkoon_ of _Emuy_.\r\n\r\nThey have got no Arts or Manufactories here, but making of lacker'd\r\nWare, a particular Account whereof I cannot as yet send you. They begin\r\nto Plant Mulberry-Trees, to breed up Worms for the Production of raw\r\nSilk; and they make some Tea, but chiefly for their own use.\r\n\r\nAltho' the following Particulars contain nothing of extraordinary\r\nmatters in them, yet such as they are, you may take, till I can procure\r\nyou better.\r\n\r\nThe three sorts of Tea commonly carry'd to _England_ are all from\r\nthe same Plant, only the Season of the Year, and the Soil, makes the\r\ndifference. The _Bohee_ (or _Voiii_, so call'd of some Mountains in\r\nthe Province of _Fo-kien_, where it is chiefly made) is the very first\r\nbud gather'd, in the beginning of _March_, and dry'd in the Shade. The\r\n_Bing_ Tea is the second growth in _April_: and _Singlo_ the last in\r\n_May_ and _June_, both dry'd a little in _Tatches_ or Pans over the\r\nFire. The Tea Shrub being an ever-green, is in Flower from _October_ to\r\n_January_, and the Seed is ripe in _September_ and _October_ following,\r\nso that one may gather both Flowers and Seed at the same time; but for\r\none fresh and full Seed, there are a hundred nought; these make up the\r\ntwo sorts of _Fruit_ in _Le Compte_'s description of Tea: As for his\r\nother sort, which he calls slymic Pease, they were nothing but the\r\nyoung Buds of the Flowers not yet open. Its Seed-Vessels are really\r\n_Tricapsular_, each _Capsula_ containing one Nut or Seed, and altho'\r\ntwo or one _Capsula_ only comes to Perfection, yet the Vestiges of the\r\nrest may be discerned. It grows in a dry gravelly Soil, on the sides\r\nof Hills in several places of this Island, without any Cultivation.\r\n\r\n_Le Compte_ is mistaken in saying (_pag. 96._) that the _Chineses_ are\r\nwholly Strangers to the Art of Grafting, for I have seen a great many\r\nof his Paradoxical Tallow-Trees ingrafted here, besides some other\r\nTrees. When they Ingraft, they do not slit the Stock as we do, but cut\r\na small slice off the outside of the Stock, to which they apply the\r\nGraft (being cut sloping on one side, agreeable to the slice cut from\r\nthe Stock) bringing up the Bark of the slice upon the outside of the\r\nGraft, they tie altogether, covering with Straw and Mud as we do.\r\n\r\nThe Commentator on _Magalhen_ seems doubtful in the length of the\r\n_Chinese Che_ or Cubit. Here they have two sorts, one of 13⁷⁄₁₀\r\n_English_ Inches, which the Merchants commonly use: The other is of\r\neleven Inches, us'd by Carpenters, and also in Geographical Measures.\r\n\r\nAlbeit _F. Martini_ is censur'd by _F. Magalhen_ for spelling a great\r\nmany _Chinese_ Words with _ng_, which the _Portuguese_ and others\r\nhave done with _m_, yet his way is more agreeable to the _English_\r\nPronunciation, only in some Words the _g_ may be left out, as in\r\n_Pekin_, _Nankin_, &c.\r\n\r\nHaving made enquiry about _Martini_'s Account of Sowing their Fields at\r\n_Ven-cheu_ with Oyster-shells, to make new ones grow; I was told that\r\nafter they have taken out the Oysters, they sprinkle the Shells with\r\nUrine, then putting them into the Water again, there grows new Oysters\r\non the foresaid Shells.\r\n\r\n_Martini_ says he could never find a _Latin_ Name for the _Fula\r\nMogorin_ of the _Portuguese_, I'm sure it's the same with the _Syringa\r\nArabica flore pleno albo in Parkinsone_. He says also, that the\r\n_Kieu-yeu_ or Tallow-tree bears a white Flower like a Cherry-tree; but\r\nall that I have seen here bears a spike of small yellow Flowers like\r\nthe _julus_ of a _Salix_.\r\n\r\nThe Bean, or _Mandarin_ Broth, so frequently mentioned in the _Dutch_\r\nEmbassy and other Authors, is only an Emulsion made of the Seed of\r\n_Sesamum_ and hot Water.\r\n\r\nTheir chief Employments here are Fishing and Agriculture.\r\n\r\nIn Fishing, they use several sorts of Nets and Lines as we do; but\r\nbecause they have large Banks of Mud in some Places, the Fisherman, to\r\ngo more easily thereon, has contriv'd a small frame about 3 or 4 Foot\r\nlong, not much larger than a Hen-trough, elevated a little at each end,\r\nin which he rests upon one Knee, leaning his Arms on a cross Stick,\r\nrais'd so high as his Breast, and putting out the other Foot often upon\r\nthe Mud, he pushes forward his Frame thereon, and so carries himself\r\nalong in it.\r\n\r\nAs to their Agriculture, all their Fields (where any thing is planted)\r\nwhether high or low, are made into such Plots as may retain the Water\r\non them when they please. They Plow up their Ground with one Buffalo\r\nor one Cow. Where they are to Sow Rice, they prepare the Fields very\r\nwell, by clearing it of all manner of Weeds, moistening to a Pulp, and\r\nsmoothing it with a Frame drawn across; on which they Sow the Rice very\r\nthick and cover it only with Water for two or three Inches high, and\r\nwhen it has grown 6 or 8 Inches long, they pull it up by the Roots, and\r\ntransplant it (by Tufts in a straight line) to Fields overflown with\r\nWater; and where a Field is subject to Weeds, when the Water drys up,\r\nthey prevent their growth in over-turning the Mud with their Hands in\r\nthe interstices where the Rice is planted. When they Sow Wheat, Barley,\r\nPulse, and other Grains, they grub up some superficial Earth, Grass and\r\nRoots, and with some Straw they burn all together; this Earth being\r\nsifted fine, they mix with the Seed, which they Sow in holes made in\r\na strait Line, and so grows up in Tufts as the Rice does; the Field\r\nbeing divided into Beds and harrowed over, both before and after the\r\nSeed is Sown: This makes them somewhat resemble Gardens. Altho' they\r\nmeliorate their Fields, where they Sow Rice, only by letting the Water\r\non them, yet for other Grains, where Ground requires it, they make use\r\nof Dung, Human Excrements, Ashes, _&c._ In watering their Fields here\r\nthey use the same Instrument mention'd by _Martini_ in the Preface to\r\nhis Atlas, being all of Wood, and the contrivance the same with that of\r\na Chain-Pump.\r\n\r\nTheir method in making of Salt is this: All the Shores here being Mud,\r\ninstead of Sand, in the Summer Season they pare off the superficial\r\nEarth, which has been overflown with the Salt Water, and lay it up in\r\nheaps for use; when they are to use it they dry it in the Sun, rubbing\r\nit small; then digging a Pit, they cover the bottom thereof with Straw,\r\nat which thro' the side of the Pit they pass a hollow Cane, that\r\nleads into a Jar, which stands below the level of the Pits bottom;\r\nthey fill the Pit almost full with the foresaid Earth, and pour Salt\r\nWater thereon, till it be covered two or three Inches with Water, which\r\ndrains through, into the foresaid Jar, and is afterwards boil'd into\r\nSalt.\r\n\r\nHad I not found the Printed News Papers last Year take notice of a\r\nsingular Root brought from _China_ by _F. Fontaney_, I should not have\r\ntold you, that I have seen one since I came here call'd _Hu-chu-u_\r\n(which I take to be the same) whereto they ascribe wonderful Properties\r\nof prolonging Life, and turning grey Hairs into black, by drinking its\r\nInfusion for some time, insomuch that they say it's to be had in value\r\nfrom 10 _Tael_ to 1000 or 2000 a single Root; for the larger it is, the\r\nmore is its value and efficacy: Which is too much Money here to try the\r\nExperiment. You have it mention'd in _Cleyer_'s _Medicina Sinica_ No.\r\n84. under the Name of _Ho-xcu-u_, according to the _Portugal_ Spelling:\r\nIt's likewise painted in the 27th Table of those Plants Mr. _Petiver_\r\nhad of me. If you'll have the Story of its Discovery, which I will not\r\nwarrant for Gospel, it runs thus. Upon a time a certain Person going\r\na Simpling among the Mountains, fell by accident into such a steep\r\nValley that he could by no means get out of it again; whereupon looking\r\nabout for something to sustain his Life; in this melancholy condition,\r\nhe espy'd this Root, of which he made Tryal; and found that in eating\r\nthereof, it serv'd him both for Provisions and Clothing, by keeping\r\nhis Body in such a temperature, that the Injuries of the Weather had\r\nno influence upon him during his stay there, which was some hundreds\r\nof Years; till at last an Earthquake happen'd in that place, whereby\r\nthe Mountains were rent, and he found a passage out to his House, from\r\nwhence he had been so long absent: But the many alterations that came\r\nto pass there in such a space of time, would not permit them to give\r\nCredit to his Story; till consulting the Annals of their Family, which\r\ngave an Account of one of them lost at that time, they were confirm'd\r\nin the truth of his Relation. And so much for this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _A Letter from Mr. _John Clayton_ Rector of _Crofton_ at\r\n    _Wakefield_ in _Yorkshire_, to the Royal Society, _May 12. 1688._\r\n    giving an Account of several Observables in _Virginia_, and in\r\n    his Voyage thither, more particularly concerning the Air._\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving oftentimes been urged to give an Account of _Virginia_, by\r\nseveral of the Worthy Members of the Royal Society, I cannot but, as\r\nfar forth as I am able, obey Commands whereby I'm so much honour'd,\r\nand show my Respect by my ready Compliance; tho' I am so sensible\r\nof my own Weakness and Incapacity to answer your Expectations, that\r\nbefore-hand I must Apologize for my self. And indeed by Sea I lost all\r\nmy Books, Chymical Instruments, Glasses and Microscopes, which rendred\r\nme uncapable of making those Remarks and Observations I had designed,\r\nthey were all cast away in Captain _Win_'s Ship, as they were to follow\r\nme; and _Virginia_ being a Country where one cannot furnish ones self\r\nagain with such things, I was discourag'd from making so diligent a\r\nScrutiny as otherwise I might have done, so that I took very few\r\nMinutes down in Writing; and therefore, since I have only my Memory\r\nto rely on, which too has the Disadvantage of it's own Weakness, and\r\nof the distance of two Years since now I left the Country, if future\r\nRelations shall in some small Points make out my Mistake, I thought\r\nthis requisite to justifie my Candor; for I ever judg'd it villanous\r\nto impose in matters of Fact; but Descriptions of things that depend\r\non Memory may be liable to Mistakes, and yet the sincerity of the\r\nPerson that delivers them intire. But hereof I shall be as cautious\r\nas possible, and shall rather wave some things whereof I have some\r\nDoubts, and am uncapable now of satisfying my self, than in any sort\r\npresume too far. The method I design is, First, to give an Account of\r\nthe Air, and all such Observations as refer thereto; then of the Water,\r\nthe Earth and Soil; the Birds, the Beasts, the Fishes, the Plants,\r\nthe Insects; and lastly, the present state of the Inhabitants: But at\r\npresent I shall neither trouble you nor my self with any more than an\r\nAccount of what refers to the Air alone, being conscious the Honourable\r\nSociety may receive such a Glut with the Imperfection of this, as to\r\nexcuse me from a farther Relation.\r\n\r\nBut before I begin, perhaps it may not be impertinent to acquaint you\r\nwith some things that happen'd in our Voyage. We sail'd in the Ship\r\n_Judith_, Captain _Trim_ Commander, 'twas Fly-boat built, about 200 or\r\n250 Tuns; she sprung a considerable Leak. When the Captain had made\r\nlong and diligent Search, had tried all methods that Seamen use upon\r\nsuch occasions, or he could think of, all in vain, and that the Leak\r\nencreased, he came pensively to consult me. Discoursing with him about\r\nit, and understanding that the Ship was Cieled within, so that though\r\nthe Leak might possibly be in the fore-part, it would fill the whole\r\nCavity betwixt the Cieling and the Planks, and so run into the Hold\r\nat all the Crevices of the Cieling up and down: I thereupon conceive,\r\nthat where it burst in betwixt the Cieling and the Planks, it must\r\nneeds make some Noise. He told me, they had endeavoured to find it out\r\nthat way, and according to custom had clapt Cans to their Ears to hear\r\nwith; but the working of the Ship, the Tackle and the Sea made such a\r\nNoise, that they could discover nothing thereby. I happily bethought my\r\nself of the Speaking Trumpet; and having one which I had contrived for\r\nsome other Conveniences, of a differing shape from the common sorts, I\r\nbid him take it and apply the broad end to the side of the Ship, the\r\nnarrow end to his Ear, and it would encrease his Hearing as much as it\r\naugmented the Voice the other way, and would ward the Ear too from the\r\nconfusion of foreign Noise. Upon the first application, accordingly\r\nthey heard it, tho' it happened to be at a considerable distance;\r\nand when they removed the Trumpet nigher, they heard it as if it had\r\nbeen the Current of a mighty River, even so distinctly, as to have\r\nApprehensions of the bigness and figure of the Hole that the Water came\r\nin at; so that cutting there the Sealing of the Ship, they immediately\r\nstopt the Leak.\r\n\r\nIn the Sea I saw many little things which the Seamen call Carvels; they\r\nare like a Jelly or Starch that is made with a cast of Blue in it; they\r\nSwim like a small Sheep's Bladder above the Water, downwards there\r\nare long Fibrous Strings, some whereof I have found near half a yard\r\nlong. This I take to be a sort of Sea-Plant, and the strings its Roots\r\ngrowing in the Sea, as Duck-weed does in Ponds. It may be reckon'd\r\namong the Potential Cauteries; for when we were one day becalm'd,\r\ngetting some to make Observations thereof, the sportful People rub'd it\r\non one anothers Hands and Faces, and where it touch'd it would make it\r\nlook very Red, and make it smart worse than a Nettle. In my return for\r\n_England_ we struck a Hauksbill Turtle, in whose Guts I found many of\r\nthese Carvels; so that it's manifest they feed thereon. 'Tis commonly\r\nasserted by the Seamen, that they can smell the Pines at _Virginia_\r\nseveral Leagues at Sea before they see Land, but I could receive no\r\nSatisfaction as to this Point; I could not discern any such thing when\r\nat a moderate distance, I fear much of this may be attributed to Fancy;\r\nfor one Day there came three or four full scent to tell me they were\r\ncertain they smelt the Pines; but it afterwards prov'd that we were\r\nat that time 200 Leagues from the Shoar, so that I was satisfied that\r\nwas therefore meer Fancy. Indeed we thought, by the general Accounts\r\nof the Ship, that we had been just on the Coast, but all were deceived\r\nby a Current we met with, that at that time set about South-East, or\r\nEast South-East, which when once becalmed we tried thus: We hoised out\r\na Boat, and took one of the Scuttles that cover'd one of the Hatches\r\nof the Ship, tying thereto a great Weight, and a strong long Rope, we\r\nlet it sink a considerable depth, and then fastening it to the Boat,\r\nit serv'd as an Anchor, that the Boat could not drive; then with the\r\nGlass and log Line we found the Current set, as I say, Eastward, at\r\nthe rate of a Mile and a half an Hour. This Current is of mischievous\r\nConsequence, it does not always run one way, but as it sets sometimes\r\nas we proved Easterly, so does it, as they say, set at other times\r\nWesterly, whereby many Ships have been lost; for then the Ships being\r\nbefore their Accounts, they fall in with the Land before they are\r\naware. Thus one Year many Ships were lost on Cape _Hattarasse_, and\r\nthereabouts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the AIR._\r\n\r\nThe Cape called _Cape Henry_, lies in 36½ of the Northern Latitude.\r\nThe Air and Temperature of the Seasons is much govern'd by Winds in\r\n_Virginia_, both as to Heat and Cold, Dryness and Moisture, whose\r\nVariations being very notable, I the more lamented the loss of my\r\nBarometers and Thermometers, for considerable Observations might be\r\nmade thereby, there being often great and suddain Changes. The Nore\r\nand Nore-West are very nitrous and piercing, cold and clear, or else\r\nstormy. The South-East and South hazy and sultry hot: Their Winter\r\nis a fine clear Air, and dry, which renders it very pleasant: Their\r\nFrosts are short, but sometimes very sharp, that it will freeze the\r\nRivers over three Miles broad; nay, the Secretary of State assured me,\r\nit had frozen clever over _Potomack_ River, over against his House,\r\nwhere it is near nine Miles over: I have observed it freezes there the\r\nhardest, when from a moist South East, on a sudden the Wind passing\r\nby the Nore, a nitrous sharp Nore-West blows; not with high Gusts,\r\nbut with a cutting brisk Air; and those Vails then that seem to be\r\nshelter'd from the Wind, and lie warm, where the Air is most stagnant\r\nand moist, are frozen the hardest, and seized the soonest, and there\r\nthe Fruits are more subject to blast than where the Air has a free\r\nMotion. Snow falls sometimes in pretty quantity, but rarely continues\r\nthere above a Day or two: Their Spring is about a Month earlier than in\r\n_England_; in _April_ they have frequent Rains, sometimes several short\r\nand suddain Gusts. _May_ and _June_ the Heat encreases, and it is much\r\nlike our Summer, being mitigated with gentle Breezes that rise about\r\n9 of the Clock, and decrease and incline as the Sun rises and falls.\r\n_July_ and _August_ those Breezes cease, and the Air becomes stagnant,\r\nthat the Heat is violent and troublesome. In _September_ the Weather\r\nusually breaks suddenly, and there falls generally very considerable\r\nRains. When the Weather breaks many fall Sick, this being the time of\r\nan Endemical Sickness, for Seasonings, Cachexes, Fluxes, Scorbutical\r\nDropsies, Gripes, or the like, which I have attributed to this Reason.\r\nThat by the extraordinary Heat the ferment of the Blood being raised\r\ntoo high, and the Tone of the Stomach relaxed, when the Weather breaks\r\nthe Blood palls, and like over-fermented Liquors is depauperated, or\r\nturns eager and sharp, and there's a crude Digestion, whence the named\r\nDistempers may be supposed to ensue. And for confirmation, I have\r\nobserved the Carminative Seeds, such as warm, and whose Oil sheaths\r\nthe acid Humors that ever result from crude Digestions. But Decoctions\r\nthat retain the Tone of the Stomach, as I suppose, by making the\r\nlittle Glands in the Tunicles of the Stomach, squeeze out their Juice,\r\n(for what is bitter may be as well offensive to the Stomach, as to\r\nthe Palate) and then Chalibiates that raise the decayed Ferment, are\r\nno bad Practice; after which, I conceive, Armoniack Spirits might be\r\nvery beneficial. But their Doctors are so Learned, that I never met\r\nwith any of them that understood what Armoniack Spirits were: Two or\r\nthree of them one time ran me clear down by consent, that they were\r\nVomitive, and that they never used any thing for that purpose but\r\nCrocus Metallorum, which indeed every House keeps; and if their Finger,\r\nas the Saying is, ake but, they immediatly give three or four Spoonfuls\r\nthereof; if this fail, they give him a second Dose, then perhaps Purge\r\nthem with 15 or 20 Grains of the Rosin of Jalap, afterwards Sweat them\r\nwith _Venice_ Treacle, Powder of Snake-Root, or _Gascoin_'s Powder;\r\nand when these fail _conclamatum est_. But to return, 'Tis wonderful\r\nwhat influence the Air has over Mens Bodies, whereof I had my self\r\nsad assurances; for tho' I was in a very close warm Room, where was\r\na Fire constantly kept, yet there was not the least Alteration or\r\nChange, whereof I was not sensible when I was sick of the Gripes, of\r\nwhich Distemper I may give a farther account in its proper place. When\r\na very Ingenious Gentlewoman was visited with the same Distemper, I\r\nhad the opportunity of making very considerable Observations. I stood\r\nat the Window, and could view the Clouds arise: For there small black\r\nfleeting Clouds will arise, and be swiftly carry'd cross the whole\r\nElement; and as these Clouds arose, and came nigher, her Torments were\r\nencreased, which were grievous as a labouring Womans; there was not the\r\nleast Cloud but lamentably affected her, and that at a considerable\r\ndistance; but by her Shrieks it seemed more or less, according to the\r\nbigness and nearness of the Clouds. The Thunder there is attended often\r\nwith fatal Circumstances: I was with my Lord _Howard_ of _Effingham_\r\nthe Governour, when they brought Word that one Dr. _A._ was killed\r\ntherewith, after this manner: He was Smoaking a Pipe of Tobacco, and\r\nlooking out at his Window when he was struck dead, and immediately\r\nbecame so stiff, that he did not fall, but stood leaning in the Window,\r\nwith the Pipe in his Mouth, in the same posture he was in when struck:\r\nBut this I only deliver as Report, tho' I heard the same Account from\r\nseveral, without any contradicting it. These things are remarkable,\r\nthat it generally breaks in at the Gable end of the Houses, and often\r\nkills Persons in, or near the Chimneys range, darting most fiercely\r\ndown the Funnel of the Chimney, more especially if there be a Fire, (I\r\nspeak here confusedly of Thunder and Lightning) for when they do any\r\nMischief, the Crash and Lightning are at the same Instant, which must\r\nbe from the nearness of the Cloud. One time when the Thunder split\r\nthe Mast of a Boat at _James_ Town, I saw it break from the Cloud,\r\nwhich it divided in two, and seem'd as if it had shot them immediatly\r\na Mile asunder, to the Eye: It is dangerous when it Thunders standing\r\nin a narrow Passage, where there's a thorough Passage, or in a Room\r\nbetwixt two Windows; tho' several have been kill'd in the open Fields.\r\n'Tis incredible to tell how it will strike large Oaks, shatter and\r\nshiver them, sometimes twisting round a Tree, sometimes as if it struck\r\nthe Tree backwards and forwards. I had noted a fine spreading Oak in\r\n_James Town_ Island, in the Morning I saw it fair and flourishing, in\r\nthe Evening I observed all the Bark of the Body of the Tree, as if it\r\nhad been artificially peel'd off; was orderly spread round the Tree,\r\nin a Ring, whose Semidiameter was four Yards, the Tree in the Center;\r\nall the Body of the Tree was shaken and split, but its Boughs had all\r\ntheir Bark on; few Leaves were fallen, and those on the Boughs as\r\nfresh as in the Morning, but gradually afterwards withered, as on a\r\nTree that is fallen. I have seen several vast Oaks and other Timber\r\nTrees twisted, as if it had been a small Willow that a Man had twisted\r\nwith his Hand, which I could suppose had been done by nothing but the\r\nThunder. I have been told by very serious Planters, that 30 or 40\r\nYears since, when the Country was not so open, the Thunder was more\r\nfierce, and that sometimes after violent Thunder and Rain, the Roads\r\nwould seem to have perfect casts of Brimstone; and 'tis frequent after\r\nmuch Thunder and Lightning for the Air to have a perfect Sulphurious\r\nSmell. Durst I offer my weak Reasons when I write to so great Masters\r\nthereof, I should here consider the nature of Thunder, and compare\r\nit with some Sulphurious Spirits which I have drawn from Coals, that\r\nI could no way condense, yet were inflamable; nay, would burn after\r\nthey pass'd through Water, and that seemingly fiercer, if they were\r\nnot over-power'd therewith. I have kept of this Spirit a considerable\r\ntime in Bladders; and tho' it appeared as if they were only blown\r\nwith Air, yet if I let it forth, and fired it with a Match or Candle,\r\nit would continue burning till all were spent. It might be worthy\r\nConsideration likewise, whether those frequent Thunders proceeded from\r\nthe Air's being more stagnant, the motion of the Winds being impeded\r\nby the Trees, or whether the motion of the Winds being obstructed by\r\nthem below, the motion might not be more violent aloft; and how far\r\nthat may promote inflammability, for Stacks of Hay or Corn that ferment\r\nwith moisture, never burn, unless when brisk Winds blow, that agitate\r\nand fan the little fermenting Sparks, and often kindle them into an\r\nactual Fire. And Observance of the Meteors there might perhaps not be\r\nImpertinent, as both what are more rare, and what are more frequent,\r\nas of _Gosimore_ in great abundance, and of those small Cob-webs in a\r\nMorning, which some have supposed to be Meteors. _Ignes fatui_, tho'\r\nthere be many boggy Swamps and Marshes, are seldom, if any are seen\r\nthere. There be frequent little sorts of Whirl-winds, whose Diameter\r\nmay be sometimes not past two or three Yards, sometimes forty, which\r\nwhisking round in a Circle, pass along the Earth, according to the\r\nmotion of the Cloud, from whence they issue; and as they pass along\r\nwith their gyrous or circular motion, they carry aloft the dry Leaves\r\ninto the Air, which fall again often in places far remote. I have\r\nseen them descend in a calm Sun-shine Day, as if they had come from\r\nthe Heavens in great Showers thereof, so that all the Elements seem'd\r\nfilled therewith. And I could perceive them to descend from on high as\r\nfar as I could possibly discern a Leaf. I remember a roguish Expression\r\nof a Seaman, otherwise silly enough, who wondering thereat, cry'd out,\r\n_Sure now 'tis manifest there is a World above!_ and now with them 'tis\r\nthe Fall of the Leaf. But to proceed, I thought this made it manifest,\r\nwhence many preternatural Showers have happen'd. I remember at Sir\r\n_Richard Atherton_'s in _Lancashire_, some few Years ago, there fell\r\na great number of the Seeds of Ivy-berries; at first we admir'd what\r\nthey were, for they were cover'd with a thin Skin that was red, and\r\nresembled the Figure of a small Wheat Corn; but afterwards they fully\r\nmanifested what they were; for many sprouted and took Root. I suppose\r\nthey were carry'd aloft by some such Whirl-wind, and let fall there. I\r\nhave purposely gone into the place where I perceived this Gust, which\r\nis notorious enough by the Noise it makes, with rattling the Leaves as\r\nit carries them aloft, and have found a fine sharp Breeze of Wind.\r\n\r\n                                                            _Yours_, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mr. _Clayton_'s second Letter, containing his farther Observations\r\n    on _Virginia_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing honour'd with the Thanks of the Society for my last, and\r\nreceiving by my worthy Friend Dr. _Moulin_ their Commands to proceed,\r\nI have added here my Observations of the Waters, and part of the Earth\r\nand Soil. I shall wave both Complements and Apologies, since I have\r\ngreater Respect and Honour for the Society than I can possibly express,\r\nand have no reason to suspect their Favour, whose Candidness I so\r\nsignally proved in my last.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the WATER._\r\n\r\n'Twixt the two Capes, the Southern, call'd the _Cape Henry_, the more\r\nNortherly call'd _Cape Charles_, there runs up a great Bay, call'd the\r\nBay of _Cheesepeak_; nine Leagues over in some places, in most Seven,\r\nlying much West, Nore and South, dividing _Virginia_ into two unequal\r\nParts. On the East side of this Bay there lies a narrow neck of Land,\r\nwhich makes the Counties of _Northampton_ and _Accomack_. On the West\r\nside of the Bay there branches forth four great Rivers, _James River_,\r\n_York River_, _Rapahanack_ and _Potomack_, that rise from a ridge of\r\nMountains, whereof more in the Sequel. These Rivers plentifully water\r\nall the other parts of _Virginia_, emptying themselves into the great\r\nBay. The Mouth of _James River_, which is the most Southerly of them,\r\nthe Mouth of _Potomack_, which is the most Northerly, may be a hundred\r\nMiles distance: But as I have been credibly inform'd that the Falls\r\nof _James River_ are not past thirty Miles from _Potomack_, which is\r\na vast large River nine Miles over in many places. I have been told\r\nit was Navigable nigh two hundred Miles, much higher than any of the\r\nother Rivers: Whence I conclude in future times, it will be the most\r\nconsiderable for Trade when the Country comes to be inhabited further\r\nup into the main Land. The other Rivers are much about three Miles over\r\na piece. And _James River_ is Navigable at least eighty Miles. Within\r\nfour or five Miles of _James Town_, _James River_ and _York River_\r\nare not past four or five Miles asunder. Yea, Sloops of considerable\r\nCarriage may Sail up the Branches of the two Rivers, till they come\r\nwithin a Mile the one of the other; for I take it to be no more from\r\nCol. _Bollards_ to Major _Troop_'s Landing, and I believe they may come\r\nmuch what as near again as Col. _Coles_, and several other places.\r\n_York_ River is distant from _Rapahanack_ in some places not past\r\nten or twelve Miles, _Rapahanack_ from _Potomack_ not past seven\r\nMiles in one place, tho' it may be sixty in others. The Heads of the\r\nBranches of the Rivers interfere and lock one within another, which I\r\nthink is best expressed after the manner that an _Indian_ explained\r\nhimself once to me, when I enquired how nigh the Rivers of _Carolina_,\r\n_Virginia_ and _Maryland_ arose out of the Mountains? from those that\r\nran Westerly on the other side of the Mountains, he clapt the Fingers\r\nof one Hand 'twixt those of the other, crying, they meet thus; the\r\nBranches of different Rivers rising not past a hundred Paces distant\r\none from another: So that no Country in the World can be more curiously\r\nwatered. But this conveniency, that in future times may make her like\r\nthe _Netherlands_, the richest place in all _America_, at the present\r\nI look on the greatest Impediment to the advance of the Country, as it\r\nis the greatest Obstacle to Trade and Commerce. For the great number\r\nof Rivers and the thinness of the Inhabitants distract and disperse a\r\nTrade. So that all Ships in general gather each their Loading up and\r\ndown an hundred Miles distant; and the best of Trade that can be driven\r\nis only a sort of _Scotch_ Peddling; for they must carry all sort of\r\nTruck that trade thither, having one Commodity to pass off another.\r\nThis (_i. e._) the number of Rivers, is one of the chief Reasons why\r\nthey have no Towns; for every one being more sollicitous for a private\r\nInterest and Conveniency, than for a publick, they will either be for\r\nmaking forty Towns at once, that is, two in every Country, or none at\r\nall, which is the Countries Ruin. But to return, The Tides in these\r\nRivers regularly ebb and flow about two Foot perpendicular at _James\r\nTown_; there is there, as they call it, a Tide and half Tide, that\r\nis, it flows near two hours along by the Shoar, after that it is ebb\r\nin the Channel, and again it ebbs near two Hours by the Shoar, after\r\nthat it is Flood in the Channel. This is great advantage to the Boats\r\npassing up and down the River. I suppose this is caused by many Creeks\r\nand Branches of the Rivers, which being considerable many, tho' only\r\nthree or four Miles long, yet as broad as the _Thames_ at _London_;\r\nothers ten Miles long, some above twenty, that have little fresh Water\r\nwhich they carry of their own, but their Current primarily depending\r\nupon the Flux and Re-flux of the Sea. So that after the Tide is made\r\nin the Channel, it flows by the Shoar a considerable time afterwards,\r\nbeing that those Creeks are still to fill, and therefore as it were\r\ndraws up a Source upwards by the Shoar; and likewise when the Tide\r\nreturns in the Channel, the Creeks that could not so readily disburse\r\ntheir Water, being still to empty themselves, they make an ebbing by\r\nthe Shoar a considerable time after that it is Flood, as I say, in\r\nthe Channel. So far as the Salt Waters reach the Country is deemed\r\nless healthy. In the Freshes they more rarely are troubled with the\r\nSeasonings, and those Endemical Distempers about _September_ and\r\n_October_. This being very remarkable, I refer the Reason to the more\r\npiercing Genius of those most judicious Members of the Society: And\r\nit might perhaps be worthy the Disquisition of the most Learned to\r\ngive an Account of the various alterations and fatal effects that the\r\nAir has on humane Bodies, especially when impregnated with a Marine\r\nSalt; more peculiarly when such an Air becomes stagnant: This might\r\nperhaps make several beneficial Discoveries, not only in relation to\r\nthose Distempers in _America_, but perhaps take in your _Kentish_\r\nAgues, and many others remarkable enough in our own Nation. I lately\r\nwas making some Observations of this nature, on a Lady of a delicate\r\nConstitution, who living in a clear Air, and removing towards the\r\nSea-Coast, was lamentably afflicted therewith, which both my self and\r\nothers attributed to this Cause, she having formerly upon her going\r\nto the same, been seized in the same manner. But to return: There is\r\none thing more in reference to this very thing very remarkable in\r\n_Virginia_, generally twice in the Year, Spring and Fall, at certain\r\nSpring-Tides, the most of the Cattle will set on gadding, and run, tho'\r\nit be twenty or thirty Miles, to the River to drink the Salt Water, at\r\nwhich time there's scarce any stopping of them; which the People know\r\nso well, that if about those times their Herds are stray'd from their\r\nPlantations, without more sollicitation they go directly to the Rivers\r\nto fetch them home again. As for the Waters in the Springs in general,\r\nthey are, I think, somewhat more eager than those in _England_. In\r\nthat I have observed, they require some quantity more of Malt to make\r\nstrong Beer than our _English_ Waters, and will not bear Soap. I have\r\ntry'd several by infusing of Galls, and found little difference in the\r\nColours, turning much what the Colour of common Sack in Taverns. I\r\ntried two Wells at Col. _Birds_, by the Falls of _James River_, several\r\nWells near _James Town_, some Springs in the _Isle of Wight County_:\r\nThere's a Spring in the _Isle of Wight_, or _Nanzamond County_, vents\r\nthe greatest Source of Water I ever saw, excepting _Holy-well in\r\nWales_, but I had not opportunity to make Experiments thereof. I tried\r\nlikewise some Springs on the Banks of _York River_, in _New Kent_ and\r\n_Gloucester County_, but found them vary very little as to Colour. I\r\ncould not try any thing as to their specifick Gravity, having neither\r\nAquapoise, nor those other Glasses I had contrived peculiarly for\r\nmaking such Experiments, they being all lost with my other things.\r\nI had Glasses blown would hold about five Ounces, others about ten\r\nOunces, with Necks so small, that a Drop would make a considerable\r\nVariation; with these I could make much more critical and satisfactory\r\nObservations as to the specifical Gravity of Liquors, having critical\r\nScales, than by any other way yet by me tried. I used this method to\r\nweigh Urines, which Practice I would recommend to the Inquisitive and\r\ncritical Physicians. I had made many Observations hereof, but all Notes\r\nwere likewise lost with my other things. Yet I have begun afresh;\r\nfor there are more signal Variations in the Weights of Urines than\r\none would at first imagin; and when the Eye can discover little, but\r\njudge two Urines to be alike, they may be found to differ very much\r\nas to Weight. By Weight I find Observations may be made of Affections\r\nin the Head, which rarely make any visible Alterations in the Urine.\r\nI have found two Urines not much unlike differ two and twenty Grains\r\nin the quantity of about four or five Ounces: But let them that make\r\nthese Essays weigh all their Urines when cold, lest they be thereby\r\ndeceiv'd. But to return to the Spring Waters in _Virginia_. There's a\r\nSpring at my Lady _Berkley's_, called _Green-Spring_, whereof I have\r\nbeen often told, so very Cold, that 'tis dangerous drinking thereof in\r\nSummer-time, it having proved of fatal Consequence to several. I never\r\ntried any thing of what Nature it is of.\r\n\r\nThere be many petrifying Waters; and indeed I believe few of the Waters\r\nbut participate of a petrifying Quality, tho' there be few Pebbles or\r\npaving Stones to be found in all the Country. But I have found many\r\nSticks with crusty Congelations round them in the Ruins of Springs,\r\nand Stones figured like Honey-Combs, with many little Stars as it were\r\nshot in the Holes. And nothing is more common than petrefy'd Shells,\r\nunless you would determine that they are parts of natural Rock shot\r\nin those Figures, which indeed I rather think; but thereof hereafter.\r\nMr. Secretary _Spencer_ has told me of some Waters participating much\r\nof _Alome_ or _Vitriol_ towards _Potomack_. Up beyond the Falls of\r\n_Rapahanack_ I have heard of Poisonous Waters. But these I only mention\r\nas a hint to further Enquiry of some others, for I can say nothing of\r\nthem my self.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _A Continuation of Mr. _John Clayton_'s Account of _Virginia_._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Earth and Soil._\r\n\r\nWhen you make the Capes of _Virginia_, you may observe it low Land, so\r\nthat at some distance the Trees appear as if they grew in the Water;\r\nand as you approach nigher to emerge thence. For a hundred Miles up\r\ninto the Country, there are few Stones to be found, only in some\r\nplaces, Rocks of Iron Oar appear, which made me expect to have found\r\nmany Waters turn Purple with Galls, but never met with any. Providence\r\nhas supplied the common use of Stones, by making the Roads very good:\r\nso that they ride their Horses without shooing them; which yet are more\r\nrarely beaten on their Feet, than ours are in _England_, the Country\r\nand Clime being dry, their Hoofs are much harder; For I observed, that\r\ntake a Horse out of the wet Marshes, and Swamps, as they there call\r\nthem, and ride him immediatly, and he'll quickly be tender-footed. In\r\nsome places, for several Miles together, the Earth is so intermix'd\r\nwith Oyster-shells, that there may seem as many Shells as Earth; and\r\nhow deep they lie thus inter-mingled, I think, is not yet known: for\r\nat broken Banks they discover themselves to be continued many Yards\r\nperpendicular. In several places these Shells are much closer, and\r\nbeing petrefied, seem to make a Vein of a Rock. I have seen in several\r\nplaces, Veins of these Rocky Shells, three or four Yards thick, at the\r\nfoot of a Hill, whose Precipice might be twenty Yards perpendicular,\r\nwhose Delf, I suppose, shot under the Hill, pieces of these Rocks\r\nbroken off, lie there, which, I suppose, may weigh twenty or thirty\r\nTuns a piece, and are as difficult to be broken as our Free-stone.\r\nOf these Rocks of Oyster-shells that are not so much petrified, they\r\nburn and make all their Lime; whereof they have that store, that no\r\nGeneration will consume. Whether these were formerly Oysters, which\r\nleft by the subsiding Seas, (as some suppose, that all that Tract of\r\nLand, now high Ground, was once overflowed by the Sea) were since\r\npetrefied, or truly Stones, _sui Generis_, I leave to the Honourable\r\nSociety to determin. But when I consider the constant and distinct\r\nshooting of several Salts, Nature's Curiosity, in every thing, so\r\nfar exceeding that of Art, that the most Ingenious, when referr'd\r\nthereto, seem only endued with an Apish fondness, I cannot think any\r\nthing too difficult or wonderful for Nature; and indeed I do not\r\napprehend, why it may not be as feasible to suppose them to have been\r\nRocks, at first shot into those Figures, as to conceive the Sea to\r\nhave amass'd such a vast number of Oyster-shells one upon another, and\r\nafterwards subsiding, should leave them cover'd with such Mountains\r\nof Earth, under which they should petrify: But not to launch forth\r\ntoo far into those Disputes, since I must modestly remember to whom\r\nI write. Often, in the looser Banks of Shells and Earth, are found\r\nperfect Teeth petrefied, some whereof I have seen, could not be less\r\nthan two or three Inches long, and above an Inch broad: Tho' they\r\nwere not Maxillary Teeth, the part that one might suppose grew out of\r\nthe Jaw, was polish'd, and black, almost as Jet; the part which had\r\nbeen fasten'd in the Jaw and Gums, was brown, and not so shiningly\r\npolish'd, or smooth; if they were, as they seemed to be, really Teeth,\r\nI suppose, they must have been of Fishes. The back-Bone of a Whale,\r\nand as I remember, they told me of some of the Ribs, were digg'd out\r\nof the side of a Hill, several Yards deep in the Ground, about four\r\nMiles distant from _James Town_, and the River. Mr. _Banister_, a\r\nGentleman pretty curious in those things, shew'd me likewise the Joint\r\nof a Whale's back-Bone, and several Teeth, some whereof, he said, were\r\nfound in Hills beyond the Falls of _James_ River, at least, a hundred\r\nand fifty Miles up into the Country. The Soil in general is Sandy:\r\nI had designed, and I think it might be worth a critical Remark, to\r\nobserve, the difference of Soils seem appropriated to the several\r\nsorts of Tobacco: For there is not only the two distinct sorts of a\r\nsweet-scented, and Aranoko Tobacco, but of each of these be several\r\nsorts much different, the Seeds whereof are known by distinct Names,\r\nthey having given them the Names of those Gentlemen most famed for\r\nsuch sort of Tobacco, as of _Prior_-seed, _&c._ Nay, the same sort\r\nof Seed in different Earths, will produce Tobacco much different,\r\nas to goodness. The richer the Ground, the better it is for Aranoko\r\nTobacco, whose Scent is not much minded, their only aim being to have\r\nit specious, large, and to procure it a bright Kite's Foot colour.\r\nHad not my Microscopes, _&c._ Tools to grind Glasses, been cast away,\r\nwith my other things, I had made some critical Enquiries into their\r\nseveral Natures, I would have examin'd what proportions of Salts, all\r\nthe sorts of Earths had afforded, and how Water impregnated with their\r\nSalts, would have changed with infusing Galls, how with the Syrup of\r\nViolets, and how they would have precipitated Mercury, or the like, and\r\nso far forth as I had been able, examined them by the several Tryals of\r\nFire. I conceive Tobacco to be a Plant abounding with Nitro-Sulphurious\r\nParticles; for the Planters try the goodness of their Seed, by casting\r\na little thereof into the Fire; if it be good, it will sparkle after\r\nthe manner of Gun-powder: so will the Stalks of Tobacco-leaves, and\r\nperhaps has something analogous to the Narcotick Sulphur of _Venus_,\r\nwhich the Chymists so industriously labour after. The World knows\r\nlittle of the efficacy of its Oyl, which has wonderful Effects in the\r\ncuring of old inveterate Sores, and Scrophulous Swellings, and some,\r\notherwise applied and qualified. The goodness of Tobacco I look on\r\nprimarily consists in the volatility of its Nitre: And hence the\r\nsandy Grounds that are most impregnated therewith, and whose Nitrous\r\nSalt is most Volatile, for such Grounds are quickliest spent, yield\r\nTobacco's that have the richest Scent, and that shortly becomes a\r\npleasant Smoak; whereas, in Tobacco that grows on stiff Ground, the\r\nSalts seem more fix'd, and lock'd up in the Oyl, so that whilst new,\r\n'tis very heady and strong, and requires some time for its Salts to\r\nfree themselves, and become Volatile; which it manifests, by its having\r\nan Urinous Smell. The same Reason satisfies, why Tobacco that grows\r\non low Lands as far as the Salts, tho' the Plant be never overflowed\r\nwith Salt Water, yet the Ground that feeds the Plant being impregnated\r\nwith Salt Water, that Tobacco Smoaks not pleasantly, and will scarcely\r\nkeep Fire, but do all that a Man can, will oft go out, and gives much\r\ntrouble in frequent lighting the Pipe, 'till after it has been kept\r\nsome considerable time: Which may be assign'd to the fixeder Saline\r\nParticles of the Marine Salt in these Plants, which require more time\r\ne'er they be render'd Volatile. Here it might be worthy an Enquiry\r\ninto the Nature of Filtration of Plants, since we may hence gather,\r\nParticles of the Marine Salt are carried along with the _Succus\r\nNutritius_ of the Plant; concerning which, if it were not too much to\r\ndeviate from the Matter in hand, I should offer some Reflections of\r\nmy own, which the Learned Society might perhaps improve: For I think\r\nthence might be made many happy Conjectures as to the Virtues of\r\nPlants. So where we see Plants, or Trees, of an open Pore growing low,\r\nwe shall find their Juice has subtile Parts: So have all Vines, whether\r\nthe Grape Vine, or Briony, or a Smilax, or the like. If a Gummous Plant\r\nor Tree, that grows low, and close Pored, it abounds with acid Spirits,\r\nas _Lignum Vitæ_, &c. if it grow tall, and be open Pored, it abounds\r\nwith a subtile Volatile Spirit, as your Firs, and the Turpentine\r\nTree. But to insist no further herein, than as this may be applicable\r\nto the present Discourse: For I have observed, that that which is\r\ncalled Pine-wood Land, tho' it be a sandy Soil, even the Sweet-scented\r\nTobacco that grows thereon, being large and porous, agreeable to\r\nAranoko Tobacco; it smoaks as coarsely as Aranoko: Wherefore 'tis,\r\nthat I believe the Microscope might make notable Discoveries towards\r\nthe knowledge of good Tobacco: For the closer the Composition of the\r\nLeaf, the better the Tobacco; and therefore the Planters and Merchants\r\nbrag of the Substance of their Tobacco; which word, did they always\r\ntake it in a true Sence, for the Solidness, and not mistake it for the\r\nThickness, it would be more consonant to a true Observation: for as I\r\nsaid of the Pine-wood Tobacco, some of it is thick and not Solid, and\r\ndiffers from the best Tobacco, as Buff does from Tann'd Leather; so\r\nthat if the Tobacco be sound and not Rotten, you may give a great guess\r\nat the goodness of Tobacco, when you weigh the Hogsheads, before you\r\nsee them: For if an equal care be taken in the packing of them the best\r\nTobacco will weigh the heaviest, and Pack the closest. Now I said,\r\nthat the Sweet-scented Tobacco most in vogue, which was most fam'd for\r\nits Scent, was that that grew on sandy Land; which is true, if you\r\nwould Smoak it whilst new, or whilst only two or three Years Old; but\r\nif you keep the stiff Land Tobacco, which is generally a Tobacco of\r\ngreat Substance five or six Years, it will much excel: For tho' the\r\nsandy Land Tobacco abound with a Volatile Nitre at first, yet the stiff\r\nLand Tobacco abounds with a greater quantity of Nitre, only that it is\r\nlock'd up in its Oyl at first, and requires more time to extricate it\r\nself, and become Volatile; but the Pine-wood Land having little of the\r\nNitro-Sulphurious Particles, neither is, nor ever will make any thing\r\nof a rich Smoak. Discoursing hereof some days since, to a Gentleman\r\nof good Observation, that has been versed with Malting, he assured\r\nme, to back this my Supposition, or Hypothesis, he had observed, that\r\nBarly that grew on stiff Ground, requir'd more time considerably to\r\nMellow, and come to perfection, than that that grew on light Land.\r\nHaving proceeded thus far to speak of Tobacco, I shall add one or two\r\nthings more. The Planters differ in their Judgments about the Time of\r\nPlanting, or Pitching their Crops: Some are for Pitching their Crops\r\nvery early, others late, without any distinction of the Nature of the\r\nSoils; and 'tis from the different Effects that they find, in that,\r\nsometimes early, sometimes the late Planting succeeds: But they have\r\nnot the Reason to judge of the Cause, to consider the Accidents of the\r\nYear, and the Difference of the Soils. In sandy Grounds they need not\r\nstrive so much for early Planting, the Looseness of the Earth, and the\r\nkind natur'd Soil, yielding all that it can, easily and speedily, and\r\nSand retaining the Heat, makes the Plants grow faster. But in stiff\r\nSoils, if the Crops be not early pitch'd, so that during the Season\r\nof Rains it have got considerable Roots, and shot them some depth,\r\nif early Droughts come, it so binds the Land, that the Roots never\r\nspread or shoot deeper, or further than the Hill that they are planted\r\nin: For they plant them as we do Cabbages, raising Hills to set every\r\nPlant in, about the bigness of a common Mole-hill: observing this on\r\nthe Plantation where I lived, that it was stiff Ground, I advised them\r\nto Plant their Crops as early as possible; and in order thereunto, I\r\ntried several ways to further the Plants; but not to trouble you with\r\nthe several Experiments that I made, in reference thereto: What I found\r\nmost advantageous was, by taking an infusion of Horse-dung, and putting\r\nthereon Soot, and then my Seeds; this I kept Forty eight Hours in an\r\nordinary digestive heat, I had two Beds left me to Sow, in the midst of\r\nthose the People sow'd, and the quantity of Seed that they generally\r\nallotted to the same quantity of Ground; when I sow'd, I mix'd Ashes\r\nwith the Seed, having decanted the Liquor, that the Seed might sow\r\nthe evener: The effect was, that my Plants came up much sooner, grew\r\nswifter, and I had five Plants for one more than any of the other Beds\r\nbore; I left the Country shortly after, and so no certainty of the\r\nfinal Result. There be had various Accidents and Distempers, whereunto\r\nTobacco is liable, as the Worm, the Fly, Firing to Turn, as they\r\ncall them, French-men, and the like. I propos'd several ways to kill\r\nthe Worm and Fly, as by Sulphur and the like; but had no opportunity\r\nto experiment it: I shall set down that I had most hopes of, which\r\nperhaps may give a hint to others to try or improve. Tobacco-seed is\r\nvery small, and by consequence so is the young Plant at first, that\r\nif gleamy Weather happen at that time, it breeds a small Fly, which\r\nconsumes the Plume of the Plant; now it being early in the Year when\r\nthey Sow the Seed, _viz._ about the fourteenth of _January_, they cover\r\nthe Ground, to secure, as well as they can, their tender Plants, from\r\nthe nipping Frosts, that may happen in the Nights; they cover them only\r\nwith a few Oak-leaves, or the like; for Straw they find apt to Harbour\r\nand Breed this Fly: I therefore would advise them to smoak Straw\r\nwith Brimstone, once in two or three Nights, and so they might cover\r\nthem securely, with that which would preserve them infinitely beyond\r\nthe Covering with Oak-boughs; indeed, I would advise them to keep\r\npeculiarly so much of their _Indian_ Corn-blades, which they gather\r\nfor their Fodder, for this very purpose, being as I conceive, much the\r\nbest, there being no Chaff to foul their Beds, and prejudice them when\r\nthey should weed them. What they call Firing is this: When Plants are\r\nof small Substance, as when there has been a very Wet and Cold Season,\r\nand very hot Weather suddainly ensues, the Leaves turn Brown, and dry\r\nto dust: the cause I conceive to be hence: The Plant being feeble, and\r\nhaving a small quantity of Oyl, which makes the more solid part of the\r\nPlant, the Earth being suddainly heated by the Sun's fiercer Beams, the\r\nRoots are rather scorch'd and dried up in the Earth, than nourish'd;\r\nso that the Plant consisting only of watry parts, is consumed, as it\r\nwere, by Fire: sometimes hopeful Plants, when by a sudden Gust some\r\nMaster Veins are broken, if suddain heat ensues, they likewise Fire:\r\nFor being not come to maturity, and being deprived of the Supports of\r\nLife and Vegetation, they likewise perish, are dried up, and fall to\r\ndust. _French-men_ they call those Plants, whose leaves do not spread\r\nand grow large, but rather spire upwards, and grow tall; these Plants\r\nthey do not tend, being not worthy their Labour. Were they so Critical,\r\nI believe, they might have great Guess what Plants were most likely to\r\nturn _French-men_, by observing whether the Roots of the Plants run\r\ndownwards, as those whose Branches are aptest to spire upwards: For\r\ntho' I have not made positive proof thereof, I have something more\r\nthan bare fancy for my conjecture; I have pull'd up some of these\r\n_French-men_, and compar'd them with the Roots of some other Plants,\r\nand found them much longer than others; and 'tis observable, loose\r\nSoils, and sandy Ground, are more subject thereto than the stiff Land.\r\nThe Country of it self is one entire Wood, consisting of large Timber\r\nTrees of several sorts, free from Thickets or under Wood, the small\r\nShrubs growing only on Lands, that have been clear'd, or in Swamps; and\r\nthus it is for several Hundreds of Miles, even as far as has yet been\r\ndiscover'd. But that shall be reserv'd 'till another opportunity.\r\n\r\n                                                             _I am_, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Mr. _John Clayton_, Rector of _Crofton_ at _Wakefield_, his Letter\r\n    to the _Royal Society_, giving a farther Account of the Soil, and\r\n    other Observables of _Virginia_._\r\n\r\n\r\nI shall here present you with a continuation of my Remarks on the\r\nRiver, Soil, and Plants of _Virginia_. And first, as to the River\r\non the other side the Mountains, said to Ebb and Flow. I have been\r\nassured by Col. _Bird_, who is one of the Intelligentest Gentlemen\r\nin all _Virginia_, and knows more of _Indian_ Affairs than any Man\r\nin the Country, that it was a Mistake; for that it must run into a\r\nLake, now called _Lake Petite_, which is fresh Water; for since that\r\ntime a Colony of the _French_ are come down from _Canada_, and have\r\nseated themselves on the back of _Virginia_, where _Fallam_ and the\r\nrest suppos'd there might be a Bay, but is a Lake, to which they have\r\ngiven the Name of _Lake Petite_, there being several larger Lakes\r\n'twixt that and _Canada_. The _French_ possessing themselves of these\r\nLakes, no doubt will in short time be absolute Masters of the Beaver\r\nTrade, the greatest number of Beavers being catch'd there. The Colonel\r\ntold me likewise, that the common Notion of the Lake of _Canada_, he\r\nwas assured was a Mistake, for the River supposed to come out of it,\r\nhad no Communication with any of the Lakes, nor the Lakes one with\r\nanother, but were distinct. But not to ramble after hear-say, and\r\nother matters; but to return to the Parts of _Virginia_ inhabited by\r\nthe _English_, which in general is a very Fertile Soil, far surpassing\r\n_England_, for there _English_ Wheat (as they call it, to distinguish\r\nit from _Maze_, commonly called _Virginia_ Wheat) yields generally\r\n'twixt Fifteen and Thirty fold, the Ground only once plow'd; whereas\r\n'tis a good Crop in _England_ that yields above Eight fold, after all\r\ntheir Toil and Labour. And yet in truth 'tis only the barrennest Parts\r\nthat they have cultivated, Tilling and Planting only the High-Lands,\r\nleaving the Richer Vales unstirr'd, because they understand not any\r\nthing of Draining. So that the Richest Meadow-Lands, which is one third\r\nof the Country, is Boggy, Marsh, and Swamp, whereof they make little\r\nAdvantage, but loose in them abundance of their Cattle, especially at\r\nthe first of the Spring, when the Cattle are weak, and venture too far\r\nafter young Grass. Whereas vast Improvements might be made thereof; for\r\nthe generality of _Virginia_ is a Sandy Land with a shallow Soil. So\r\nthat after they have cleared a fresh piece of Ground out of the Woods,\r\nit will not bear Tobacco past two or three Years, unless Cow-pen'd;\r\nfor they Manure their Ground by keeping their Cattle, as in the South\r\nyou do your Sheep, every Night confining them within Hurdles, which\r\nthey remove when they have sufficiently dung'd one spot of Ground;\r\nbut alas! they cannot Improve much thus, besides it produces a strong\r\nsort of Tobacco, in which the Smoakers say they can plainly taste the\r\nfulsomeness of the Dung. Therefore every three or four Years they must\r\nbe for clearing a new piece of Ground out of Woods, which requires much\r\nLabour and Toil, it being so thick grown all over with Massy Timber.\r\nThus their Plantations run over vast Tracts of Ground, each ambitioning\r\nto engross as much as they can, that they may be sure to have enough\r\nto Plant, and for their Stocks and Herds of Cattel to Range and Feed\r\nin, that Plantations of 1000, 2000, or 3000 Acres are common, whereby\r\nthe Country is thinly inhabited; their Living solitary and unsociable;\r\nTrading confused and dispersed; besides other Inconveniences: Whereas\r\nthey might Improve 200 or 300 Acres to more Advantage, and would make\r\nthe Country much more Healthy; for those that have 3000 Acres, have\r\nscarce cleared 600 Acres thereof, which is peculiarly term'd the\r\nPlantation, being surrounded with the 2400 Acres of Woods: so that\r\nthere can be no free or even motion of the Air, but the Air is kept\r\neither stagnant, or the lofty Sulphurous Particles of the Air, that\r\nare higher than the tops of the Trees, which are above as high again\r\nas the generality of the Woods in _England_, descending when they pass\r\nover the cleared spots of Ground, must needs in the violent heat of\r\nSummer, raise a preternatural Ferment, and produce bad Effects. Nor\r\nis it any advantage to their Stocks, or Crops; for did they but drain\r\ntheir Swamps, and Low-Lands, they have a very deep Soil, that would\r\nendure Planting twenty or thirty Years, and some would scarce ever\r\nbe worn out, but be ever longer better, for they might lay them all\r\nWinter, or when they Pleased in Water, and the product of their Labour\r\nwould be double or treble, whether Corn or Tobacco; and that this is no\r\nfond Projection, (though when I have discoursed the same to several,\r\nand in part shewn them how their particular Grounds might be drained\r\nat a very easie rate) they have either been so conceited of their old\r\nway, so sottish as not to apprehend, or so negligent as not to apply\r\nthemselves thereto. But on the Plantation where I lived, I drained a\r\ngood large Swamp, which fully answered expectation. The Gentlewoman\r\nwhere I lived, was a very Acute Ingenious Lady; who one day Discoursing\r\nthe Overseer of her Servants, about pitching the ensuing Year's Crop.\r\nThe Overseer was naming one place where he designed to Plant 30000\r\nPlants, another place for 15000, another for 10000, and so forth the\r\nwhole Crop, designed to be about 100000 Plants: Having observed the\r\nYear before he had done the like, and scattered his Crop up and down\r\nthe Plantation, at Places a Mile, or a Mile and a half asunder, which\r\nwas very Inconvenient, and whereby they lost much time. I interposed,\r\nand asked, why they did not Plant all their Crop together? The Fellow\r\nsmiled as it were at my Ignorance, and said, there was very good\r\nReason for it. I replied, that was it I enquir'd after. He returned,\r\nthe Plantation had been an old planted Plantation, and being but a\r\nsmall Plot of Ground, was almost worn out, so that they had not Ground\r\naltogether that would bring forth Tobacco. I told him then they had\r\nbetter Ground than ever yet they had planted, and more than their Hands\r\ncould manage. He smil'd again, and asked me, where? I then named such a\r\nSwamp. He then said scornfully, he thought what a Planter I was; that\r\nI understood better how to make a Sermon, then managing Tobacco. I\r\nreplied with some warmness, tho' I hoped so, that was Impertinence, and\r\nno Answer. He then said, that the Tobacco there would drown, and the\r\nRoots rot. I replied, that the whole Country would drown if the Rivers\r\nwere stopt, but it might be laid as dry as any Land on the Plantation.\r\nIn short, we discoursed it very warmly, till he told me, he understood\r\nhis own Business well enough, and did not desire to learn of me. But\r\nthe Gentlewoman attended somewhat better to my Reasoning, and got me\r\none day to go and shew her how I projected the draining of the Swamp,\r\nand thought it so feasible, that she was resolved to have it done; and\r\ntherefore desir'd me I would again Discourse her Overseer, which I did\r\nseveral times, but he would by no means hearken thereto, and was so\r\npositive, that she was forc'd to turn him away, to have her Servants\r\nset about the Work; and with three Men in thirteen Days I drained the\r\nwhole Swamp, it being Sandy Land, soaks and drains admirably well, and\r\nwhat I little expected, laid a Well dry at a considerable distance.\r\nThe Gentlewoman was in _England_ last Year, and I think Dr. _Moulin_\r\nwas by when she asked me. Now to teach her how she might make her\r\nTobacco that grew in the Swamp less, for it produced so very large,\r\nthat it was suspected to be of the _Aranoko_ kind: I told her, though\r\nthe complaint was rare, yet there was an Excellent Remedy for that, in\r\nletting every Plant bear eight or nine Leaves instead of four or five,\r\nand she would have more Tobacco, and less Leaves. Now you must know\r\nthey top their Tobacco, that is, take away the little top-bud, when\r\nthe Plant has put forth as many Leaves as they think the Richness of\r\nthe Ground will bring to a Substance; but generally when it has shot\r\nforth four or six Leaves. And when the top-bud is gone, it puts forth\r\nno more Leaves, but Side-branches, which they call Suckers, which they\r\nare careful ever to take away, that they may not empoverish the Leaves.\r\nI have been more tedious in the Particulars, the fullier to evince how\r\nresolute they are and conceitedly bent to follow their old Practice\r\nand Custom, rather than to receive Directions from others, tho' plain,\r\neasie, and advantageous. There are many other Places as easie to drain\r\nas this, tho' of larger extent, and richer Soil, for some of which I\r\nhave given directions, and have only had the return perhaps of a flout\r\nafterwards: Even in _James Town Island_, which is much what of an Oval\r\nFigure, there's a Swamp runs Diagonal-wise over the Island, whereby is\r\nlost at least 150 Acres of Land, which would be Meadow, which would\r\nturn to as good Account as if it were in _England_: Besides it is\r\nthe great annoyance of the Town, and no doubt but makes it much more\r\nunhealthy. If therefore they but scour'd the Channel, and made a pretty\r\nordinary Trench all along the middle of the Swamp, plac'd a Sluice at\r\nthe Mouth, where it opens into the back Creek; for the Mouth of the\r\nChannel there is narrow, has a good hard bottom, and is not past two\r\nYards deep when the Flood is out; as if Nature had designed it before\r\nhand: They might thus drain all the Swamp absolutely dry, or lay it\r\nunder Water at their Pleasure. I have talked several times hereof to\r\nMr. _Sherwood_, the owner of the Swamp, yet nothing is essayed in Order\r\nthereto. And now since we are speaking of _James Town_ give me leave to\r\nadjoin some Reflections as to the Situation and Fortifications of the\r\nPlace. The Natural Situation of the place is such, as perhaps the World\r\nhas not a more commodious Place for a Town, where all things conspire\r\nfor Advantage thereof.\r\n\r\n_James Town Island_ is rather a _Peninsula_, being joined to the\r\nContinent by a small Neck of Land, not past Twenty or Thirty Yards\r\nover, and which at Spring-Tides is overflow'd, and is then an absolute\r\nIsland. Now they have built a silly sort of a Fort, that is, a Brick\r\nWall in the shape of a Half-Moon, at the beginning of the Swamp,\r\nbecause the Channel of the River lies very nigh the Shoar; but it is\r\nthe same as if a Fort were built at _Chelsey_ to secure _London_ from\r\nbeing taken by Shipping. Besides Ships passing up the River are secured\r\nfrom the Guns of the Fort, till they come directly over-against the\r\nFort, by reason the Fort stands in a Vale, and all the Guns directed\r\ndown the River, that should play on the Ships, as they are coming up\r\nthe River, will lodge their Shot within Ten, Twenty, or Forty Yards in\r\nthe rising Bank, which is much above the Level of the Fort; so that if\r\na Ship gave but a good Broad-side, just when she comes to bear upon\r\nthe Fort, she might put the Fort into that confusion, as to have free\r\nPassage enough. There was indeed an old Fort of Earth in the Town,\r\nbeing a sort of _Tetragone_, with something like Bastions at the four\r\nCorners, as I remember; but the Channel lying further off to the middle\r\nof the River there, they let it be demolished, and built that new one\r\nspoke of, of Brick, which seems little better than a blind Wall, to\r\nshoot Wild Ducks or Geese.\r\n\r\nIf they would build a Fort for the Security of the Town and Country, I\r\nconceive it should be on _Archer_'s _Hope Point_, for that would stop\r\nthe Ships from passing up the River, before they came to the Town,\r\nand would secure the Town from being block'd up by Sea. The Channel\r\nat _Archer_'s _Hope Point_ lies close by the Shoar, and makes such an\r\nAngle there by reason of _Hog Island_, that going up or down the River,\r\nlet the Wind be where it will, they must there bring the contrary Tack\r\non Board, and generally when they About the Ship as they call it, they\r\nare so near the Shoar, that a Man may almost fling a Finger-stone on\r\nBoard. How much this hinders the motion of a Ship, and what Confusion\r\nit must be to them to bring a contrary Tack on Board, whilst they\r\nhave all the Guns of a Fort playing so nigh upon them, may readily be\r\nconceived. _Archer_'s _Hope_ is a Neck of Land, that runs down three\r\nMiles long, not much past half a Mile broad betwixt the Main River and\r\n_Archer_'s _Hope Creek_, which has large Marshes and Swamps; so that\r\na Citadel built upon the Point, would almost be Impregnable, being it\r\ncould be attack'd no way but one, which is so narrow a slender Neck\r\nof Land, that it would be difficult to take it that way: And it would\r\nsecure _James Town_ from being block'd, being it would not be past a\r\nMile by Water, to the Point of _James Town Island_. The Island is so\r\nsurrounded with Water and Marshy Land, that the Town could never be\r\nBomb'd by Land. But now to return to the Reflections of Improving, and\r\nManuring of Land in _Virginia_; hitherto, as I have said, they have\r\nused none but that of Cow-penning; yet I suppose they might find very\r\ngood Marle in many places, I have seen both the red and blew Marle at\r\nsome breaks of Hills: This would be the properest Manure for their\r\nSandy Land, if they spread it not too thick, theirs being, as I have\r\nsaid, a shallow, Sandy Soil, which was the Reason I never advised any\r\nto use Lime, tho' they have very good Lime of Oyster-shells; but\r\nthat's the properest Manure for cold Clay Land, and not for a Sandy\r\nSoil. But as most Lands have one Swamp or another bordering on them,\r\nthey may certainly get admirable Slitch, wherewith to Manure all their\r\nuplands. But this, say they, will not improve Ground, but clods and\r\ngrows hard; 'tis true, it will do so for some time, a Year or two at\r\nthe first; but did they cast it in heaps, and let it lie for two or\r\nthree Years after a Frost or two had seized it, and it had been well\r\npierced therewith, I doubt not it would turn to good Account: And for\r\nthis too I have something more than bare conjecture; for Discoursing\r\nit once with a good notable Planter, we went to view a heap thereof,\r\nthat casually he had cast up 'twixt three and four Years before, and we\r\nfound it not very binding, but rather a fine Natural Mold, whereupon\r\nhe did confess, he then remembred that out of a ridge of the like Mold\r\nhe had very large Plants, which must have been of the like Slime or\r\nSlitch cast up before: But said, that himself and others despaired of\r\nthis Manure, because they had taken of this Slitch fresh and moist\r\nout of the Swamp, and fill'd Tobacco Hills with it, and in the midst\r\nof it planted their Plants, which so bound the Roots of their Plants,\r\nthat they never came to any thing. But he said, he then saw his Error,\r\nyet I have not heard he has remembred to Correct it. But 'tis strange\r\nin how many things besides they are remiss, which one would think\r\n_English_ Men should not be guilty of. They neither House nor Milk any\r\nof their Cows in Winter, having a Notion that it would kill them; yet\r\nI perswaded the afore-mentioned Lady where I lived, to Milk four Cows\r\nthe last Winter that I staid in the Country, whereof she found so good\r\nEffect, that she assured me she would keep to my Advice for the future;\r\nand also as I had further urged, House them too, for which they have\r\nmighty Conveniencies, their Tobacco Houses being empty ever at that\r\ntime of the Year, and may easily be fitted in two or three days time\r\nwithout any Prejudice; whereby their Cattle would be much sheltered\r\nfrom those Pinching sharp Frosts that some Nights on a sudden become\r\nvery severe. I had another Project for the Preservation of their Cattle\r\nproved very successful; I urged the Lady to sow her Wheat as early as\r\npossibly she could, so that before Winter it might be well rooted,\r\nto be early and flourishing at the first of the Spring: So that she\r\nmight turn thereon her weak Cattle, and such as should at any time be\r\nswamp'd, whereby they might be recruited and saved, and it would do the\r\nWheat good also. I advised her likewise to save, and carefully gather\r\nher _Indian_ Corn-tops, and blades, and all her Straw, whatever could\r\nbe made Fodder, for her Cattle; for they get no Hay, tho' I was urging\r\nher to that too, and to sow _Saintfoin_; for being a Sandy Soil, I am\r\nconfident it would turn to very good Account. They have little or no\r\nGrass in Winter, so that their Cattle are pined and starved, and many\r\nthat are brought low and weak, when the Spring begins, venture too far\r\ninto the Swamps after the fresh Grass, where they perish; so that\r\nseveral Persons lose ten, twenty or thirty Head of Cattle in a Year: I\r\nobserved this was much owing to their Inadvertency and Error in their\r\nway of Managing and Feeding them; for they get little Fodder, but as\r\nthey think Corn being more Nourishing, feed them with their _Indian_\r\nCorn, which they give them Morning and Evening; they spend thus a\r\ngreat quantity of Corn, and when all's done, what signifies two or\r\nthree Heads of Corn to a Beast in a Morning? It makes them only linger\r\nabout the Houses for more? and after that sweet Food they are not so\r\nprompt to browse on the Trees, and the course Grass which the Country\r\naffords. So that thus their Guts shrink up, and they become Belly-shot\r\nas they call it. I advised therefore never to give them any thing in a\r\nMorning, whereby as soon as they were set forth of the Cow-pens, they\r\nwould fall a feeding, and tho' they filled their Bellies only with such\r\ncourse stuff as had little Nourishment in it, yet it would keep out\r\ntheir Bellies, and they would have a better Digestion; and then when\r\nthey were come home at Nights, to Fodder them, beginning with Straw and\r\ntheir coarsest Fodder, which they would learn to eat by degrees, before\r\nthey tasted that that was more delicate, and whilst their digestion was\r\nstrong, would yield them Nourishment to keep them still so; afterwards\r\nwhen the Winter pinched, their fine Fodder then would stand them in\r\nstead; and hereby they might preserve their weakest Cattle. By these\r\nMethods, and the help of the Wheat-patch, she, the Gentlewoman where\r\nI lived, saved all her Cattle, and lost not one in Two Winters after,\r\nthat I staid there; besides she saved above Twenty Barrels of Corn, as\r\nI remember that she told me she used to spend upon her Stock; and a\r\nBarrel of Corn is commonly worth Ten Shillings. Nay further, The last\r\nSpring she fed Two Beasts, a Bullock and a Cow, Fat, upon her Wheat,\r\nwith the addition only of a little boil'd Corn, and yet the Wheat was\r\nscarce eat down enough. But to return again to the Nature of the Earth,\r\nwhich may be pretty well gather'd from what I have already said. I\r\nhave observed, that at Five or Six yards deep, at the breaks of some\r\nbanks, I have found veins of Clay, admirable good to make Pots, Pipes,\r\nor the like of, and whereof I suppose the _Indians_ make their Pipes,\r\nand Pots, to boil their Meat in, which they make very handsomly, and\r\nwill endure the Fire better than most Crucibles: I took of this Clay,\r\ndryed, powder'd, and sifted it; powdered and sifted Potsherds, and\r\nGlass; Three parts, Two parts and One part as I remember, and therewith\r\nmade a large Crucible, which was the best I yet ever tried in my Life;\r\nI took it once red hot out of the Fire, and clapt it immediately into\r\nWater, and it started not at all. The Country abounds mightily with\r\nIron Oar, that as I have been assured by some upon tryal, has been\r\nfound very good. There are Rocks thereof appear at the precipice of\r\nHills, at the foot whereof there runs a River fit for a Forge, and\r\nthere's Wood enough to supply it with Charcoal; as I have heard there\r\nwas formerly some Persons undertook the Work, and when they had made\r\nbut a small quantity of Iron, which proved very good, the _Indian_\r\nMassacre happened, and they being higher seated than the then Inhabited\r\npart of the Country, were all cut off, and the Works demolished; so\r\nthat it has frighted others I think from the like attempt; besides,\r\nsuch a work requires a greater Fund, and Bank of Mony to carry it on,\r\nthan any there are able to lay out; and for Persons in _England_ to\r\nmeddle therewith, is certainly to be cheated at such a distance; some\r\n_Indians_ brought Col. _Bird_ some Black Lead, whereof he told me\r\nthere was great store. There's very curious Chalk towards the falls of\r\n_Rapahanock_ River, which they burn and make a delicate white Wash of\r\nit. The Secretary of State Col. _Spencer_, has assured me, there were\r\nVitriolick or Alluminous Earth on the Banks of _Potomack_. And thus\r\nfar of what my Memory supplies me, referring to the Earth; in the next\r\nplace I shall give a short account of the Birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the BIRDS_\r\n\r\nI had indeed begun once whilst I was in that Country to have made a\r\nCollection of the Birds, but falling sick of the Griping of the Guts,\r\nsome of them for want of care corrupted, which made them fling others\r\naway that I had thoroughly cured; for I was past taking care of them\r\nmy self, there remaining but small hopes of my Life.\r\n\r\nThere are Three sorts of Eagles, the largest I take to be that they\r\ncall the Grey Eagle, being much of the colour of our Kite or Glead.\r\n\r\nThe Second is the Bald Eagle, for the Body and part of the Neck being\r\nof a dark brown, the upper part of the Neck and Head is covered with a\r\nwhite sort of Down, whereby it looks very bald, whence it is so named.\r\n\r\nThe Third is the Black Eagle, resembling most the _English_ Eagle;\r\nthey build their Nests much after the manner that Dr. _Willoughby_\r\ndescribes, and generally at the top of some tall old Tree, naked of\r\nBows and nigh the River side, and the People fall the Tree generally\r\nwhen they take the young; they are most frequently sitting on some tall\r\nTree by the River side, whence they may have a prospect up and down the\r\nRiver, as I suppose to observe the Fishing Hauks; for when they see the\r\nFishing Hauk has struck a Fish, immediately they take Wing, and 'tis\r\nsometimes very pleasant to behold the Flight, for when the Fishing Hauk\r\nperceives her self pursued, she will scream and make a terrible noise,\r\ntill at length she lets fall the Fish to make her own escape, which\r\nthe Eagle frequently catches before it reach the Earth or Water. These\r\nEagles kill young Lambs, Pigs, _&c._\r\n\r\nThe Fishing Hauk is an absolute Species of a Kings-fisher, but full\r\nas large, or larger than our Jay, much of the Colour and Shape of a\r\nKings-fisher, tho' not altogether so curiously Feather'd; it has a\r\nlarge Crop, as I remember, there is a little Kings-fisher much the same\r\nin every respect with ours.\r\n\r\nIf I much mistake not, I have seen both Goss Hauk and Falcon; besides\r\nthere are several sorts of the lesser Kind of Stannels.\r\n\r\nThere is likewise the Kite and the Ringtail.\r\n\r\nI never heard the Cuckow there to my remembrance.\r\n\r\nThere's both a brown Owl and white Owl, much what as large as a Goose,\r\nwhich often kills their Hens and Poultry in the Night; the white Owl is\r\na very delicate Feather'd Bird, all the Feathers upon her Breast and\r\nBack being Snow-white, and tipp'd with a Punctal of Jet-black: besides\r\nthere is a Barn Owl much like ours; and a little sort of Scritch Owl.\r\n\r\nThere's both the Raven, and the Carrion-Crow; I do not remember I\r\never saw any Rooks there. Dr. _Moulin_ and my self, when we made our\r\nAnatomies together, when I was at _London_, we shew'd to the _Royal\r\nSociety_, that all Flat-bill'd Birds that groped for their Meat, had\r\nthree Pair of Nerves, that came down into their Bills; whereby as we\r\nconceived they had that accuracy to distinguish what was proper for\r\nFood, and what to be rejected by their Taste when they did not see it;\r\nand as this was most evident in a Duck's Bill and Head, I draw'd a Cut\r\nthereof, and left it in your Custody: A Duck has larger Nerves that\r\ncome into their Bills than Geese or any other Bird that I have seen\r\nand therefore quaffer and grope out their Meat the most: But I had then\r\ndiscover'd none of these Nerves in Round-bill'd Birds: But since in my\r\nAnatomies in the Country, in a Rook I first observed two Nerves came\r\ndown betwixt the Eyes into the upper Bill, but considerably smaller\r\nthan any or the three Pair of Nerves in the Bills of Ducks, but larger\r\nthan the Nerves in any other Round-bill'd Birds; and 'tis remarkable\r\nthese Birds more than any other Round-bill'd Birds seem to grope for\r\ntheir Meat in Cow-dung and the like: Since I have found in several\r\nRound-bill'd Birds the like Nerves coming down betwixt the Eyes, but\r\nso very small that had I not seen them first in a Rook I should scarce\r\nhave made the discovery; in the lower Bill there are Nerves have much\r\nthe same situation with the Flat-bill'd Birds, but very small, and\r\nscarce discernable, unless to the Cautious and Curious.\r\n\r\nThe Night Raven, which some call the _Virginia_ Bat, is about the\r\nbigness of a Cuckow, feather'd like them but very short, and short\r\nLeg'd, not discernable when it flies, which is only in the Evening\r\nscudding like our Night Raven.\r\n\r\nThere's a great sort of ravenous Bird that feeds upon Carrion, as big\r\nvery nigh as an Eagle, which they call a Turky Bustard, its Feathers\r\nare of a Duskish black, it has red Gills, resembling those of a Turky,\r\nwhence it has its Name; it is nothing of the same sort of Bird with our\r\n_English_ Turky Bustard, but is rather a Species of the Kites, for it\r\nwill hover on the Wing something like them, and is carnivorous; the\r\nFat thereof dissolved into an Oil, is recommended mightily against old\r\nAches and Sciatica Pains.\r\n\r\nI think there are no Jackdaws, nor any Magpys; they there prize a\r\nMagpye as much as we do their Red Bird.\r\n\r\nThe _Pica Glandaria_, or Jay, is much less than our _English_ Jay, and\r\nof another colour, for it is all blue where ours is brown, the Wings\r\nmarbled as curiously as ours are, it has both the same Cry, and sudden\r\njetting Motion.\r\n\r\nThere are great Variety and Curiosity in the Wood-peckers, there's\r\none as big as our Magpye, with blackish brown Feathers, and a large\r\nScarlet Tuft on the top of the Head: There are four or five sorts of\r\nWood-peckers more, variegated with Green, Yellow and Red Heads, others\r\nspotted black and white, most lovely to behold. There's a Tradition\r\namongst them, that the Tongue of one of these Wood-peckers dryed will\r\nmake the Teeth drop out if pick'd therewith, and cure the Tooth-ach\r\n(tho' I believe little of it, but look on it as ridiculous) yet I\r\nthought fit to hint as much that others may try; for sometimes such old\r\nStories refer to some peculiar Virtues, tho' not to all that is said of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThere be wild Turkies extream large; they talk of Turkies that have\r\nbeen kill'd, that have weigh'd betwixt 50 and 60 Pound weight; the\r\nlargest that ever I saw, weigh'd something better than 38 Pound; they\r\nhave very long Legs, and will run prodigiously fast. I remember not\r\nthat ever I saw any of them on the Wing, except it were once: Their\r\nFeathers are of a blackish shining Colour, that in the Sun shine like a\r\nDove's Neck, very specious.\r\n\r\nHens and Cocks are for the most part without Tails and Rumps; and as\r\nsome have assured me our _English_ Hens after some time being kept\r\nthere have their Rumps Rot off; which I'm the apter to believe, being\r\nall their Hens are certainly of _English_ breed. I'm sorry I made no\r\nAnatomical Observations thereof, and Remarks about the Use of the Rumps\r\nin Birds, which at present I take to be a couple of Glands, containing\r\na sort of Juice for the Varnishing the Feathers; having observed all\r\nBirds have much recourse with their Bills to the Rumps when they dress\r\ntheir Plumes, whereby they scud thro' the Air more nimbly in their\r\nFlight.\r\n\r\nPartridges there are much smaller than ours, and resort in Covies as\r\nours do; their Flesh is very white, and much excels ours in my mind,\r\n_Sed de gustibus non est disputandum_.\r\n\r\nTheir Turtle-Doves are of a duskish blue colour, much less than our\r\ncommon Pidgeon, the whole Train is longer much than the Tails of our\r\nPidgeons, the middle Feather being the longest. There's the strangest\r\nStory of a vast number of these Pidgeons that came in a Flock a few\r\nYears before I came thither; they say they came thro' _New England_,\r\n_New York_ and _Virginia_, and were so prodigious in number as to\r\ndarken the Sky for several Hours in the place over which they flew, and\r\nbrake massie Bows where they light; and many like things which I have\r\nhad asserted to me by many Eye-witnesses of Credit, that to me it was\r\nwithout doubt, the Relaters being very sober Persons, and all agreeing\r\nin a Story: nothing of the like ever happen'd since, nor did I ever see\r\npast Ten in a Flock together that I remember. I am not fond of such\r\nStories, and had suppressed the relating of it, but that I have heard\r\nthe same from very many.\r\n\r\nThe Thrush and Feldefire are much like ours, and are only seen in\r\nWinter there, accordingly as they are here.\r\n\r\nTheir Mocking Birds may be compared to our Singing Thrushes, being much\r\nof the same bigness; there are two sorts, the Gray and the Red, the\r\ngray has Feathers much of the colour of our gray Plovers with white\r\nin the Wings like a Magpye; this has the much softer Note, and will\r\nimitate, in its singing, the Notes of all Birds that it hears, and\r\nis accounted much the finest Singing Bird in the World. Dr. _Moulin_\r\nand I made in our Anatomy many Observations of Singing Birds to this\r\neffect: The Ears of Birds differ much from those of Men or Beasts,\r\nthere's almost a direct passage from one Ear to the other of Birds,\r\nso that prick but the small Membrane call'd the Drum on either Ear,\r\nand Water poured in at one Ear will run out at the other: But this\r\nis not all, but what is much more remarkable, they have no Coclea,\r\nbut instead thereof there's a small Cocleous or twisting Passage that\r\nopens into a large Cavity, that runs betwixt two Sculls, and passes\r\nall round the Head, the upper Scull is supported by many hundreds of\r\nsmall Thred-like Pillars or Fibers, which as we supposed had another\r\nuse also, to break the Sound from making any confused Echo, and to\r\nmake it one and distinct; this passage we observed betwixt the two\r\nSkulls was much larger in Singing Birds than in others that do not\r\nsing, so very remarkable that any Person that has been but show'd\r\nthis may easily judge by the Head what Bird is a Singing Bird, or has\r\naptitude thereto, tho' he never saw the Bird before, nor knew what\r\nBird it were: This has often made me reflect how much the Modification\r\nof Voices depends upon the accuracy of the Ear, and how deaf Persons\r\nbecome Dumb: And since I have observed that many Children that have\r\nan acute Wit enough that are slow of Speech, that is long before they\r\nspeak are much longer before they can pronounce those Letters that\r\nare sharps, as _g._ _h._ _r._ and never have an aptitude to learn to\r\nsing. Hence I judge that Songs that have many Sharps in them are the\r\ndifficultest to sing well, and discover any Persons skill upon the\r\ntrial of Musick most. This I suppose only, having no Skill in Musick\r\nmy self, nor having ever discoursed any Person about it. As I remember\r\nwe show'd some of these things to the _Royal Society_, and I drew some\r\nCuts thereof, and gave the Doctor upon promise that he would put these\r\nand many other our joint Observations in Print, but I hear he is since\r\ndead. I have Anatomized most sorts of Creatures, and never found any\r\nFour-footed Creature with an Ear like a Bird, unless a Mole; and a Mole\r\nhas an Ear much like them, with a very thin double Scull, and great\r\nCavity like a Bird, and is very acute of hearing, the Scull by reason\r\nof the large Cavity is very slender and easily crush'd, so that a Mole\r\nis quickly kill'd with a bruise on the Scull like a Lark, and upon the\r\nbruise the Membranes of the Scull turn black; whence _Segerus_ mistake\r\n_Membranæ Cerebri in superficie exteriori omnino nigræ visæ_. But when\r\nI have taken care not to bruise the Skull the Membranes were not black\r\nat all, both _Segerus_ and _Severinus_ I think had some perceptions\r\nof the different Structure of a Mole's Ear, but not any thing of its\r\nAnalogy to a Bird's Ear; they speak of a Bone _Egregie pumicosum_:\r\nAnd _Segerus_ says there's a _Ductus ad ossis usque petrosi cavitatem\r\nprotensus, plurimis fibrillis Membraneis annectabatur_. But to return,\r\nthis Mocking Bird having its Name from _Mimicking_, all other Birds in\r\nsinging is a wonderful mettled Bird, bold and brisk, and yet seems to\r\nbe of a very tender Constitution, neither singing in Winter, nor in the\r\nmidst of Summer, and with much difficulty are any of them brought to\r\nlive in _England_.\r\n\r\nThe Red Mocking is of a duskish red, or rather brown; it sings very\r\nwell, but has not so soft a Note as the gray Mocking Bird.\r\n\r\nOf _Virginia_ Nightingale, or red Bird, there are two sorts, the Cocks\r\nof both sorts are of a pure Scarlet, the Hens of a Duskish red; I\r\ndistinguish them into two sorts, for the one has a tufted Cops on the\r\nHead, the other is smooth-feather'd. I never saw a tufted Cock with a\r\nsmooth-headed Hen, or on the contrary; they generally resorting a Cock\r\nand Hen together, and play in a Thicket of Thorns or Bryars in the\r\nWinter, nigh to which the Boys set their Traps, and so catch them and\r\nsell them to the Merchants for about Six Pence apiece; by whom they are\r\nbrought for _England_; they are something less than a Thrush.\r\n\r\nThere's a Bird very injurious to Corn, they call a Blackbird; I look\r\non it a sort of Starling, for they cry something like them but do not\r\nsing, are much what of the same bigness, have Flesh blackish like\r\ntheirs; they resort in great Flocks together, they are as black as\r\na Crow all over their Bills and all, only some of them have scarlet\r\nFeathers in the Pinions of their Wings. _Quæry_, Whether a distinct\r\nSpecies?\r\n\r\nThey have a Lark nothing differing from our common Lark; they have\r\nanother Bird which they call a Lark that is much larger, as big as a\r\nStarling, it has a soft Note, feeds on the Ground; and as I remember\r\nhas the Specifical Character of a long Heel, it is more inclined to\r\nyellow, and has a large half Moon on its Breast of yellow; if it have\r\nnot a long Heel, _Quære_, Whether a Species of the Yellow-hammer?\r\n\r\nThey have a Martin very like, only larger than ours, that builds after\r\nthe same manner. The honourable Col. _Bacon_ has remarked for several\r\nYears, that they constantly come thither upon the Tenth of _March_\r\none or two of them appearing before, being seen hovering in the Air\r\nfor a Day or two then go away, and as he supposed return'd with the\r\ngreat Flock. The Colonel delighted much in this Bird, and made like\r\nPidgeon-holes at the end of his House with Boards purposely for them.\r\n\r\nTheir Swallow differs but little from ours.\r\n\r\nThey have a Bird they call a Blue-bird, of a curious azure colour about\r\nthe bigness of a Chaffinch.\r\n\r\nThere be other sorts of Goldfinches variegated with Orange and Yellow\r\nFeathers, very specious and beautiful.\r\n\r\nSparrows not much different from the _English_, but build not in the\r\nEaves of Houses that ever I saw.\r\n\r\nThe Snow-bird which I take to be much the same with our Hedge-Sparrow;\r\nthis is so called because it seldom appears about Houses but against\r\nSnow or very cold Weather.\r\n\r\nThe Humming Bird that feeds upon the Honey of Flowers: I have been told\r\nby some Persons, that they have kept of these Humming Birds alive, and\r\nfed them with Water and Sugar: they are much the smallest of all Birds,\r\nhave long Bills and curious coloured Feathers, but differ much in\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nHerons three or four several sorts, one larger than the _English_,\r\nfeather'd much like a _Spanish_ Goose.\r\n\r\nAnother sort that only comes in Summer Milk white, with red Legs very\r\nlovely to behold.\r\n\r\nThe Bittern is there less than in _England_, and does not make that\r\nsounding Noise that ever I heard.\r\n\r\nCurlews something less than our _English_, tho' bigger than a Wimbrel.\r\n\r\nThe Sandpiper much resembling the _English_.\r\n\r\nThe Snipe, two sorts, one resembling ours, the other much less.\r\n\r\nThe Tewits are smaller than the _English_, and have no long Toppins,\r\nbut just like a young one that begins to fly.\r\n\r\nThere are a great number of wild Swans.\r\n\r\nWild-geese and Brent-geese all Winter in mighty Flocks, Wild-ducks\r\ninnumerable, Teal, Wigeon, Sheldrakes, Virginia-didapers, the\r\nBlack-diver, _&c._\r\n\r\nIn my return home for _England_, _May 1686._, off of the Banks of\r\n_Newfoundland_, when we were, according to account, a hundred Leagues\r\nfrom the Shoar, we saw several prodigious floating Islands of the Ice,\r\nno less to our Wonder than Terror, for they were very dangerous: I got\r\nthe Master to sail one day as nigh one of them as we securely durst,\r\nwhich we judged to be full a League in length, and was higher above\r\nWater than the top of our Main-mast; the Snow drove to and fro upon it\r\nas upon a large Plane. There was a great Flock of small Black-divers,\r\nthat were not much bigger than a Fieldfare, came to us a little before,\r\nbut all of them then left and betook themselves to this Island of Ice.\r\nThey dived the constantly'st, and the longest at a time of any Bird\r\nthat I ever saw. We saw, as I remember, nigh Thirty of these Islands\r\nof Ice. Captain _Rider_ being some fews days later in his Passage, and\r\nbearing more to the _Nore_, told me, he saw many more of these Islands\r\nof Ice, and some much larger.\r\n\r\nThere are in _Virginia_ a great many Cormorants; several sorts of\r\nGulls, and in about the Bay many Bannets. Thus much for the Birds.\r\n\r\n                                                            _Yours_, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _A Continuation of Mr. _Clayton_'s Account of _Virginia_._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of the Beasts of _Virginia_._\r\n\r\nThere were neither Horses, Bulls, Cows, Sheep, or Swine, in all the\r\nCountry, before the coming of the _English_, as I have heard, and have\r\nmuch reason to believe. But now among the _English_ Inhabitants there\r\nare good store of Horses, though they are very negligent and careless\r\nabout the Breed: It is true, there is a Law, that no Horse shall be\r\nkept stoned under a certain size, but it is not put in execution.\r\nSuch as they are, there are good store, and as cheap or cheaper than\r\nin _England_, worth about Five Pounds apiece. They never Shoe them,\r\nnor Stable them in general; some few Gentlemen may be something more\r\nCurious, but it is very rare; yet they Ride pretty sharply, a Planter's\r\nPace is a Proverb, which is a good sharp Hand-Gallop. The _Indians_\r\nhave not yet learned to Ride, only the King of _Pomonkie_ had got three\r\nor four Horses for his own Saddle, and an Attendant, which I think\r\nshould in no wise be indulged, for I look on the allowing them Horses\r\nmuch more dangerous than even Guns and Powder.\r\n\r\n_Wild Bulls_ and _Cows_ there are now in the uninhabited Parts, but\r\nsuch only as have been bred from some that have strayed, and become\r\nWild, and have propagated their kind, and are difficult to be shot,\r\nhaving a great Acuteness of Smelling. The common rate of a Cow and\r\nCalf is 50_s._ sight unseen, be she big or little, they are never very\r\ncurious to examine that Point.\r\n\r\nTheir _Sheep_ are of a middling size, pretty fine fleeced in general,\r\nand most Persons of Estate begin to keep Flocks, which hitherto has not\r\nbeen much regarded, because of the Wolves that destroy them; so that\r\na piece of Mutton is a finer Treat, than either Venison, Wild-Goose,\r\nDuck, Wigeon, or Teal.\r\n\r\n_Elke_, I have heard of them beyond the Inhabitants, and that there was\r\none presented to Sir _William Berkley_, which he sometime kept.\r\n\r\n_Deer_, there are abundance of brave Red Deer, so that a good Woodsman,\r\nas they call them, will keep a House with Venison; the _Indians_, they\r\nsay, make Artificial sorts of Heads of Boughs of Trees, which they\r\nConsecrate to their Gods, and these they put on to deceive the Deer\r\nwhen they go a Shooting, or Hunting, as they call it, and by mimicking\r\nthe Feeding of the Deer, they by degrees get within Shot.\r\n\r\n_Swine_, they have now in great abundance, Shoats or Porkrels are their\r\ngeneral Food; and I believe as good as any _Westphalia_, certainly far\r\nexceeding our _English_.\r\n\r\n_Rackoone_, I take it to be a Species of a Monkey, something less\r\nthan a Fox gray-hair'd, its Feet formed like a Hand, and the Face too\r\nhas likewise the resemblance of a Monkeys, besides being kept tame\r\nthey are very Apish: They are very prejudicial to their Poultry, as I\r\nremember.\r\n\r\nAn _Opossum_, as big, and something shaped like our Badgers, but of a\r\nlighter Dun colour, with a long Tail something like a Rat, but as thick\r\nas a Man's Thumb; the Skin of its Belly is very large, and folded so\r\nas to meet like a Purse, wherein they secure their Young whilst little\r\nand tender, which will as naturally run thither, as Chickens to a Hen;\r\nin these False Bellies they will carry their Young; these also feed on,\r\nand devour Corn.\r\n\r\n_Hares_, many will have them to be a Hedge-Rabbet, but I know not\r\nwhat they mean thereby. I take them to be a perfect Species of Hares,\r\nbecause I have seen Leverets there with the white spot in the Head\r\nwhich the Old ones have not, so it is in _England_; and the Down is\r\nperfectly of the colour of our Hares, they sit as our Hares do, and\r\nmake no Holes and Burrows in the Earth; true, they are but about the\r\nbigness of an _English_ Rabbet, and run no faster; they generally take\r\ninto some hollow Tree within a little space, which then the People\r\ncatch by gathering the withered Leaves, and setting them on fire within\r\nthe hollow of the Tree, and smoaking of them so till they fall down.\r\nSometimes they take long Bryars, and twist them in the Down and Skin,\r\nand so pull them forth.\r\n\r\n_Squirrels_, there are three sorts. The first is the great Fox\r\nSquirrel, much larger than the _English_, and gray, almost as a common\r\nRabbet. These are very common, I have eaten of them at the best\r\nGentlemen's Tables, and they are as good as a Rabbet. The Second is\r\nthe Flying Squirrel, of a lighter Dun colour, and much less than the\r\n_English_ Squirrel; the Skin on either side the Belly extended is very\r\nlarge betwixt the fore-leg and hind-leg, which helps them much in their\r\nskipping from one Bough to another, that they will leap farther than\r\nthe Fox-Squirrel, though much less, yet this is still rather skipping\r\nthan flying, though the distinction be well enough. The Third is the\r\nGround-Squirrel, I never saw any of this sort, only I have been told\r\nof them, and have had them thus described to me, to be little bigger\r\nthan a Mouse, finely spotted like a young Fawn; by what I further\r\napprehended, they are an absolute sort of Dor-Mouse, only different in\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\n_Musk-Rats_, in all things shaped like our Water-Rats, only something\r\nlarger, and is an absolute Species of Water-Rats, only having a curious\r\nMusky scent: I kept one for a certain time in a wooden Chest; two\r\ndays before it died it was extraordinary Odoriferous, and scented the\r\nRoom very much; but the day that it died, and a day after the scent\r\nwas very small, yet afterwards the Skin was very fragrant; the Stones\r\nalso smelt very well. They build Houses as Beavers do, in the Marshes\r\nand Swamps (as they there call them) by the Water-sides, with two or\r\nthree ways into them, and they are finely daubed within. I pulled one\r\nin pieces purposely to see the contrivance: There were three different\r\nLodging-Rooms, very neat, one higher than another, as I conceive\r\npurposely made for Retirement, when the Water rises higher than\r\nordinary; they are considerably large, having much Trash and Lumber to\r\nmake their Houses withal; I suppose they live mostly on Fish.\r\n\r\n_Batts_, as I remember at least two sorts; one a large sort with long\r\nEars, and particularly long straggling Hairs. The other much like the\r\n_English_, something larger I think, very common.\r\n\r\nI never heard of any _Lions_; they told me of a Creature killed whilst\r\nI was there, in _Glocester_ County, which I conceived to be a sort of\r\nPard, or Tyger.\r\n\r\n_Bears_ there are, and yet but few in the Inhabited part of _Virginia_;\r\ntowards _Carolina_ there are many more. There was a small Bear killed\r\nwithin three Miles of _James City_ the Year that I left the Country,\r\nbut it was supposed to have strayed, and swam over _James River_. They\r\nare not very fierce, their Flesh is commended for a very rich sort of\r\nPork; but the lying side of the Bear, as I remember, is but half the\r\nvalue of the other, weight for weight.\r\n\r\nThere are several sorts of _Wild-Cats_ and _Poll-Cats_.\r\n\r\n_Beavers_ build their Houses in like manner as the Musk-Rats do, only\r\nmuch larger, and with pieces of Timber make Dams over Rivers; as I\r\nsuppose either to preserve their Furs dry in their passage over the\r\nRivers, otherwise to catch Fish by standing to watch them thereon, and\r\njumping upon them on a sudden; they are very subtil Creatures, and\r\nif half the Stories be true that I have been told, they have a very\r\norderly Government among them; in their Works each knows his proper\r\nWork and Station, and the Overseers beat those Young Ones that loiter\r\nin their Business, and will make them cry, and work stoutly.\r\n\r\n_Wolves_ there are great store; you may hear a Company Hunting in\r\nan Evening, and yelping like a pack of Beagles; but they are very\r\ncowardly, and dare scarce venture on any thing that faces them; yet if\r\nHungry, will pull down a good large Sheep that flies from them. I never\r\nheard that any of them adventured to set on Man or Child.\r\n\r\n_Foxes_, they are very much like ours, only their Fur is much more\r\ngrisled, or gray; neither do I remember ever to have seen any\r\nFox-holes, but of this I am not positive.\r\n\r\nEvery House keeps three or four Mungrel _Dogs_ to destroy Vermin, such\r\nas _Wolves_, _Foxes_, _Rackoons_, _Opossums_, &c. But they never Hunt\r\nwith Hounds, I suppose, because there are so many Branches of Rivers,\r\nthat they cannot follow them. Neither do they keep Grey-Hounds, because\r\nthey say, that they are subject to break their Necks by running against\r\nTrees, and any Cur will serve to run their Hares into a hollow Tree,\r\nwhere after the aforesaid manner they catch them.\r\n\r\nThey have great store both of Land and Water _Tortoises_, but they are\r\nvery small, I think I never saw any in that Country to exceed a Foot in\r\nlength; there is also another sort of Land-Tortoise, different from the\r\ncommon sort, with a higher ridged Back, and speckled with red sort of\r\nSpots.\r\n\r\n_Frogs_ they have of several sorts, one of a prodigious largeness,\r\neight or ten times as big as any in _England_, and it makes a strange\r\nnoise, something like the Bellowing of a Bull, or betwixt that and the\r\nhollow sounding noise that the English Bittern makes.\r\n\r\nAnother very common sort, which they call _Toads_, because black, but\r\nI think differs nothing from our black Frog. They have Toads also like\r\nours in _England_; and another small sort of Frog, which makes a noise\r\nlike Pack-horse Bells all the Spring long. Another little green Frog,\r\nthat will leap prodigiously, which they therefore call the Flying Frog.\r\nThere is frequently heard in the Woods a shrill sort of noise, much\r\nlike that which our Shrew-Mouse makes, but much sharper; I could never\r\nlearn the certainty what it was that made this noise, it is generally\r\nin a Tree, and some have asserted to me, that it was made by the green\r\nFrog, yet I scarcely believe it. Mr. _Banister_ assured me it was made\r\nby a sort of _Scarabeus_ Beetle, that is I think full as big as the\r\nHumming-Bird; but neither do I believe that, and for this Reason, for I\r\nnever saw that Beetle so low as the Salts, but always as high up in the\r\nCountry as the Freshes, and that noise is frequent all over the Country.\r\n\r\n_Lizards_, that are gray, and very common, the Snakes feed much on\r\nthem, for I have taken several of them out of the Bellies of Snakes.\r\n\r\n_Snakes_, about seven several sorts. The Rattle-Snake, so called from\r\ncertain Rattles at the end of the Tail: These Rattles seem like so\r\nmany perished Joints, being a dry Husk over certain Joints, and the\r\ncommon Opinion is, that there are as many Rattles or Joints, as the\r\nSnake is years old. I kill'd four or five, and they had each eleven,\r\ntwelve, or thirteen Joints each; but the young Ones have no Rattles\r\nof a year or two, but they may be known notwithstanding, being very\r\nregularly diced or checker'd, black and gray on the backs. The Old\r\nshake and shiver these Rattles with wonderful nimbleness when they\r\nare any ways disturbed; their bite is very deadly, yet not always of\r\nthe same force, but more or less Mortal, accordingly as the Snake is\r\nin force or vigour, and therefore in _June_ or _July_ much worse,\r\nand more Mortal, than in _March_ and _April_. This Snake is a very\r\nMajestick sort of Creature, and will scarce meddle with any thing\r\nunless provok'd, but if any thing offend it, it makes directly at\r\nthem. I was told a pleasant Story of an Old Gentlemen, Col. _Cleyborn_\r\nas I remember was his Name, the same that sent the Rattle-Snakes to\r\nthe _Royal Society_ some Years since. He had an odd Fancy of keeping\r\nsome of these Snakes always in Barrels in the House, and one time an\r\n_Indian_ pretending to Charm them so as to take them by the Neck in his\r\nHand without biting of him; the Old Gentleman caused a Rattle-Snake\r\nto be brought forth, the _Indian_ began his Charm with a little Wand,\r\nwhisking it round and round the Rattle-Snake's Head, bringing it by\r\ndegrees nigher and nigher, and at length flung the Switch away, and\r\nwhisked his Hand about in like manner, bringing his Hand nigher still\r\nand nigher, by taking less Circles, when the old Gentleman immediately\r\nhit the Snake with his Crutch, and the Snake snap'd the _Indian_ by\r\nthe Hand, and bit him very sharply betwixt the Fingers, which put\r\nhis Charm to an end, and he roared out; but stretch'd his Arm out as\r\nhigh as he could, calling for a string, wherewith he bound his Arm as\r\nhard as possibly he could, and clapt a hot burning Coal thereon, and\r\nsinged it stoutly, whereby he was cured, but looked pale a long while\r\nafter. And I believe this truly one of the best ways in the World of\r\nCuring the Bite either of Viper or Mad Dog. I was with the Honourable\r\nEsquire _Boyle_, when he made certain Experiments of Curing the Bite\r\nof Vipers with certain _East-India_ Snake-stones, that were sent him\r\nby King _James_ the Second, the Queen, and some of the Nobility,\r\npurposely to have him try their Vertue and Efficacy: For that end\r\nhe got some brisk Vipers, and made them bite the Thighs of certain\r\nPullets, and the Breasts of others: He applied nothing to one of the\r\nPullets, and it died within three Minutes and a half, as I remember;\r\nbut I think they all recovered to which he applied the Snake-stones,\r\ntho' they turned wonderful pale, their Combs, _&c._ immediately, and\r\nthey became extream sick, and purged within half an hour, and the next\r\nmorning all their Flesh was turned green to a wonder, nevertheless\r\nthey recovered by degrees. The manner of the Application was only\r\nby laying on the Stone, and by two cross-bits of a very sticking\r\n_Diaculum_ Plaister binding it on, which he let not lie on past an\r\nhour or two, but I think not so long, took the Stone off, and put it\r\ninto Milk for some time; some Stones were of much stronger Vertue than\r\nothers. I proposed a piece of unquench'd Lime-stone to be apply'd\r\nto see whether it might not prove as powerful, but know not whether\r\never it was tried. But here one telling Mr. _Boyle_ the Story of this\r\n_Indian_, he approved the method of Cure, and said, an actual Cautery\r\nwas the most certain Cure. The Poison, both of Viper and Mad-Dog (as I\r\nconceive) kill by thickning of the Blood, after the manner that Runnet\r\ncongeals Milk when they make Cheese. Vipers, and all the Viperous\r\nBrood, as Rattle-Snakes, _&c._ that are deadly, have I believe their\r\nPoisonous Teeth Fistulous, for so I have observed that Vipers Teeth\r\nare, and the Rattle-Snakes very remarkable, and therefore they kill so\r\nvery speedily by injecting the Poison through those Fistulous Teeth\r\ninto the very Mass of Blood; but the bite of Mad-Dogs is oft of long\r\ncontinuance before it get into and corrupt the Mass of Blood, being\r\nit sticks only to the out-sides of the Teeth, and therefore when they\r\nbite thro' any thickness of Cloaths, it rarely proves Mortal, the\r\nCloaths wiping the Poison off before it come to the Flesh. A Girl that\r\nwas bit about _New-Years Day_, continued well till _Whitsontide_, when\r\ncoming to see certain Friends in our Parts, she fell very ill, and\r\nbeing a Poor Girl, they came to me; it pleased God I recovered her.\r\nSometime after she returned to give me thanks for saving her Life,\r\nbeing two Persons that were bit with the same Dog, were dead, whilst\r\nshe remained under Cure, and therefore she was the fullier convinc'd\r\nshe owed her life to me; but of this I shall give a more particular\r\nInstance by and by. But the Poisons of Vipers seems to be like the\r\ninjecting of Liquors into the Veins of Creatures; Dr. _Moulin_ and I\r\nmade many Experiments of this Nature together, and I have made many\r\nmore by my self. We once, I remember, injected half a Dram of Allom\r\ninto the Jugalar-Vein of a Dog before the _Royal Society_, (the Allom\r\nbeing only dissolved in a little Water) which within something less\r\nthan one Minutes time was so absolutely dead, as not to have the least\r\nConvulsive Motion; and I have done the like with many other things\r\nbesides Allom, but with some things it is more curdled and broken, than\r\nwith others; and will differ much both as to colour and consistence.\r\nSalt-Petre kills much as quickly as Allom, but then the Blood in the\r\nHeart looks very florid, smooth, and even. I wish some Person of\r\nObservation and Leisure would prosecute these sort of Experiments,\r\nand make Injections of the several things most used in Physick into\r\nthe Veins of Creatures, both in quantities, and into different Veins,\r\nas into the Thigh-veins of some Dogs, and Jugalars of some others,\r\nand in much lesser quantities of such things as kill suddenly; for in\r\nthe little time I have spent in these sort of Experiments, I easily\r\nperceive notable discoveries might be made thereby: One Dog that\r\nlived became Lame and Gouty; another with Quick-Silver died in about\r\nSixteen Weeks time, Consumptive, and I discovered Quick-Silver in the\r\nImpostumated parts of his Lungs. _Query_, Whether some Persons that\r\nhave been Flux'd, or used Quick-silver Oyntments, and the like, and\r\nafterwards become consumptive, owe not their Distemper to the abusive\r\nuse of a most excellent Remedy? Much after the same manner, the subtile\r\nQuick-Silver getting into the Mass of Blood by degrees, through its\r\nponderosity settles in the Lobes of the Lungs, and causes Ulcers\r\nthere. But to return: The Poison of Vipers and Mad Dogs I suppose kill\r\nby thickning of the Blood, as many Malignant Fevers, also do; in all\r\nwhich Cases, I look on Volatil Salts to be the properest Physick, as\r\nkeeping the Blood from congealing. I had a singular Instance hereof in\r\na Gentleman of _Yorkshire_, bit with a Grey-Hound on the _Thursday_,\r\nnot three Minutes before the Dog died Mad; he bit him in several places\r\nof the Hands, as he was giving him a Remedy: The _Monday_ following\r\nthe Gentleman was very ill, and came to our Town to an Apothecary\r\nhis Acquaintance, who knowing not what to do, desired my Assistance.\r\nWhen I came, the Gentleman could talk, but every two or three Minutes\r\nhe had violent Fits, and would tell us when they were over, that his\r\nBrains worked like Birm in an Ale-Fat, and seemed to Froth up at every\r\nFit. The Apothecary had no Volatile Salt of Vipers; so I took the\r\nVolatile Salt of Amber, and ordered him Ten Grains in Treacle-Water\r\nevery half hour: He told me every Dose seemed to clear his Brain, and\r\ncool it as perfectly, as if a Bason of Cold Water were poured on his\r\nHead, but it returned by degrees again: Having then a Volatile Salt\r\nby me that Vomits very well, I gave him a Dose thereof, it worked\r\nvery well, and he was very much better after it: I then ordered him\r\nto continue the Volatile Salt of Amber once every four hours, and at\r\neach two hours end, that is betwixt, _Spec. Pleres Archonticon and Rue\r\npouder'd ana gr._ 15. whereby he was so well recovered, that within\r\ntwo days he would needs go home, to look after some urgent Affairs,\r\nand afterwards found himself so well, that he forgot to return, and\r\nperfect the course; and I heard no more of him for half a Year, when\r\nI was fetch'd one Morning to him in great hast. He had been abroad,\r\nplay'd the Good-Fellow, and in his return home, having rode a great\r\ndays Journey, being weary, and I suppose finding himself indisposed,\r\nhe staid all Night in our Town, it being fortunately in his way. In\r\nthe Morning when he should have got up, he could not stand, whereupon\r\nthe Apothecary was sent for, and a Surgeon to Blood him, which was\r\naccordingly done, but he grew worse; for in this Case I look upon\r\nBleeding to be very prejudicial, as well as in most Malignant Fevers,\r\nfor thereby the Spirits are diminished, and the Blood congeal'd the\r\nsooner. When they had done all they could, and the Symptoms still\r\nincreased, they at length sent for me. I never saw Man or Creature in\r\nthat Agony in all my life, that I found him in, Senseless, and Mad,\r\nwhen at best, but every Minute the fiercest shiverings ran through him,\r\nhis Eyes would first roll and then set, as if ready to start out of his\r\nHead, but above all, the Swelling and Luctation at his Breast, was as\r\nif he would burst, which went off with a prodigious sigh: All this I\r\njudge the Effects of the Heart labouring to discharge it self of the\r\nstagnating Blood, and the Nervous Convulsions as consequences thereof.\r\nAnd I am the more confirm'd in this, from what I saw in a Woman that\r\nwas bit also with a Mad-Dog in the Leg, and fell ill the very day that\r\nshe had paid the Chirurgeon for her Cure; and notwithstanding all that\r\ncould be done, growing worse, they sent for me; I went, and found her\r\nwith what is called a _Hydrophobia_: She would look earnestly after\r\nDrink or Water, and seem to desire it, but as soon as she began to\r\ndrink, away it went, be it what it would, with the greatest Violence\r\nshe could possibly fling it. I gave her the Vomit hereafter and also\r\nbefore mentioned, but she got but little of it down, and I had no\r\nmore with me; nevertheless it so brought her to her self, that she\r\ncould answer Questions, and I asked her, whether she was afraid of\r\nthe Drink and Water, when she flung the Cups in that violent manner\r\nfrom her? She said No; but when she offered to drink, her Breast and\r\nHeart would not let her. I asked, whether through any Aversion or\r\nFear? She said, No, she was very Thirsty; but when she offered to\r\ndrink, it struck to her Heart, and stopped her Breath. That is, as I\r\napprehend, the cold Drink passing down the Throat struck a chillness\r\nin the Blood, and made it readier to stagnate: Besides the very act of\r\nDrinking, hindering the free breathing, conduced also much thereto;\r\nand therefore the Heart was so suddenly oppress'd, that she could not\r\nforbear flinging away whatever she had in her Hand. She complained also\r\nof a great rigour and stiffness or straitness of the Muscles of her\r\nBreast, so that possibly the Spiritous Liquor that flows in the _Genus\r\nNervosum_ may be congeal'd as well as the Blood; or the same Effects\r\nmay be supposed notwithstanding to be the result of the condensed\r\nBlood clogging both the Heart and Lungs, so that the Breast may seem\r\nto be straitened therewith. The same I judge to be the cause of all\r\nthe violent Luxations in this Gentleman, whose Fingers I looked on,\r\nand found the places where he had formerly been bit, turned blackish,\r\nand much inflamed about them, which confirmed me in my sentiment, that\r\nit was a relapse of his former Distemper, that is, of the Bite of the\r\nMad-Dog. I told them, if any thing in the World would save his Life, I\r\njudged it must be the former Vomit of Volatile Salts; they could not\r\ntell what to do, nevertheless such is the Malignancy of the World,\r\nthat as soon as it was given, they ran away and left me, saying, he\r\nwas now certainly a dead Man, to have a Vomit given in that condition.\r\nNevertheless it pleased God that he shortly after cried, _This Fellow\r\nin the Black has done me good_, and after the first Vomit, came so to\r\nhimself, as to know us all. I vomited him every other day with this\r\nVomit for three times, and made him in the Interim to take Volatile\r\nSalt of Amber, and the aforesaid Powders, and to wash his Hands, and\r\nSores in a strong Salt Brine: to drink Posset-drink with Sage and\r\nRue, and by this course, and the Blessing of God, his Life was saved,\r\nand he perfectly cured, for it is now four Years since, and he had\r\nhad no Relapse. I have cured several others by the same Method. Coll.\r\n_Spencer_, the Secretary of State in _Virginia_, a very Serious and\r\nIngenious Gentleman, told me, that his Servant brought him word once\r\nthat a Sow having farrow'd, a Rattle-Snake was got into the Den, and\r\nhad kill'd the Piggs. The Colonel went to see the Snake, which they\r\nsaid was still coyl'd in the Den; there followed them two or three\r\nMungrel Curs, and they sat one of the Dogs at the Snake, which was\r\ntoo quick for the Dog, and snapt him by the Nose, whereupon he set a\r\nhowling, and run immediately into the adjacent River, and died very\r\nshortly after. Another of the Dogs upon the like attempt was bit by the\r\nSnake also, and fell a howling, and frothing, and tumbling; but being\r\nhe died not so soon as the other Dog did, they fetched some of the Herb\r\nwhich they call Dittany, as having a great Traditionary Vertue for the\r\nCure of Poisons; they pounded it, and adding a little Water, express'd\r\nthe Juice, and gave the Dog frequently thereof, nevertheless he died\r\nwithin a day or two. The howling of the Dogs he supposed gave notice\r\nto the Sow, and made her come furiously bristling, and run immediately\r\ninto her Den; but being likewise bit by the Snake, she set up a\r\nterrible Squeak, and ran also into the River, and there died.\r\n\r\nA Gentlewoman, that was a notable Female Doctress, told me, that a\r\nNeighbour being bit by a Rattle-Snake, swelled excessively; some days\r\nafterwards she was sent for, who found him swell'd beyond what she\r\nthought it had been possible for the Skin to contain, and very Thirsty.\r\nShe gave him _Oriental Bezoar_ shaved, with a strong Decoction of the\r\naforesaid Dittany, whereby she recovered the Person: To the best of my\r\nRemembrance, it was he that told me, asking him afterwards, what he\r\nfelt when the Snake first bit him? He said, it seemed as if a flash of\r\nFire had ran through his Veins.\r\n\r\nBesides the Rattle-Snake, there is the Blowing-Snake, an absolute\r\nSpecies of a Viper, but larger than any that I have seen in _Europe_;\r\nit is so called, because it seems to blow, and spread its Head, and\r\nswell very much before it bite, which is very deadly. It is Remarkable\r\nthere is none of their Snakes there, make any of that hissing noise\r\nthat ours in _England_ make, but only shoot out their Tongues, shaking\r\nthem as ours do, without any noise at all; this is a short thick\r\nsort of Snake. There is another sort of deadly Snake, called the\r\n_Red-Snake_; I once narrowly escaped treading on the back of one of\r\nthem: They are of an ugly dark brown colour, inclining to red; their\r\nBellies are of a more dusky white, with a large streak of Vermillion\r\nRed on either side; this too is of the Viper kind, but is not so short,\r\nbut its Tail is more taper and small. The _Horn-Snake_ is, as they\r\nsay, another sort of deadly Snake; I never saw any of them, unless\r\nonce, shortly after my Arrival in that Country, which I cannot attest\r\nto be the Horn-Snake, for I could not distinctly view it, being in\r\na Thicket of _Sumach_, it was perch'd up about two Foot high in a\r\n_Sumach_ Branch, its Tail twisted about the Shrub, and about a quarter\r\nof a Yard stood bolt forward, leaning over the forked branch thereof: I\r\ncould not see the Horn, which they say it has in its front, wherewith\r\nit strikes, and if it wounds, is as deadly as the Rattle-Snake's bite.\r\nThe Gentleman that was with me, told me it was a Horn-Snake, but being\r\nin hast, and on Horse-back, and the Snake in a Thicket, I could not see\r\nthe Horn; but had I thought I should never have seen more of them, I\r\nshould have took a little pains to have been better satisfied. This I\r\nthink may not improperly be referr'd to the _Dart-Snakes_.\r\n\r\nThe _Black-Snake_, is the largest I think of all others, but I am sure\r\nthe most common; I have kill'd several of them full six Foot long,\r\ntheir Bite is not deemed Mortal, but it swells, and turns to a Running\r\nSore; they feed upon Lizards, Mice, Rats, Frogs, and Toads, which I\r\nhave taken out of their Bellies. I was once a Simpling in the woods,\r\non a fair Sun-shine day, when I saw a Snake crawling on a Tree that\r\nwas fallen, and licking with its forked Tongue as it moved; I stood\r\nstill to observe it, and saw it lick up small Insects and Flies with\r\nwonderful nimbleness, catching them betwixt the Forks of its Tongue.\r\n\r\nThe _Corn-Snake_, most like the Rattle-Snake of all others in colour,\r\nbut the Checkers are not so regular, neither has it any Rattles: They\r\nare most frequent in the Corn-Fields, and thence I suppose so called;\r\nthe Bite is not so venomous as the Black-Snakes.\r\n\r\nThe _Water-Snake_, a small Snake, I never saw any of them above a Yard\r\nlong, though I have sometimes seen Forty or Fifty at once; they are of\r\nan ugly dark blackish colour: They say, they are the least Venomous of\r\nany.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Part of Two Letters from Mr. _J. Hillier_, dated _Cape Corse_,\r\n    _Jan. 3. 1687/8._ and _Apr. 25. 1688._ Wrote to the Reverend Dr.\r\n    _Bathurst_, President of _Trinity Colledge, Oxon_; giving an\r\n    Account of the Customs of the Inhabitants, the Air, _&c._ of that\r\n    Place, together with an Account of the Weather there from _Nov.\r\n    24. 1686._ to the same Day 1687._\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           _Cape Corse, Jan. 3. 1687/8._\r\n\r\nI Thought the Custom of destroying Slaves at the Death of great People\r\nhad been abolish'd, and I was so inform'd; but we have seen that it\r\nis not; for _Oct. 3._ this Year, died _Ahen Penin Ashrive_, King\r\nof _Feton_, here at _Cape Corse_, where he had been long sick; the\r\nFetishers had done all they could to save his Life, which was nothing\r\nat all to purpose; their Physick scarce extends to any thing but the\r\nFlux, and what we call the French Disease; his was a Consumption and\r\nan Asthma (if I mistake not the Word) of a great continuance: so they\r\nfled to the Aid of their Religion, and according it seems to the Rules\r\nof that, they made several Pellets of Clay, which they set in his\r\nRoom, in Rank and File, all sprinkled with blood; besides the several\r\nMuttons which they eat to his good Health. But that was of too little\r\nForce; so the Man died, having delivered his Sword to the Dy, who in\r\nthe _Interregnum_ was to be the principal Man, for the Kingdom is\r\nElective, contrary to what we wrote before, and commanding him to be\r\nconstant to the _English_, of whom himself had been a great Favourer,\r\nwith a Threat, if he was not, of haunting him after his Death; he also\r\nappointed one of his Wives, whom he thought worthy of that unlucky\r\nHonour, to accompany him to the other World; the next Day he was\r\ncarried to _Feton_, and buried there, _Nov. 2._ with the poor Woman we\r\nspoke of. Presently after, they that were considerable, or had a mind\r\nto seem so, sent in them that they had a mind to Murder in Honour of\r\nthe King: how many there were 'tis hard to say, the highest Account\r\ngives 90, the lowest 50, the middle 70; the Blacks do not understand\r\nArithmetick, so the Numbers they give in all Cases are very uncertain.\r\nI think there were about Eight from this Town, which will not hold\r\nProportion to the highest rate; but 'tis like near _Feton_ there might\r\nbe more. They say also, that many more will follow at half a Years\r\ndistance from his Death. The manner of the Execution of these poor\r\nCreatures I have not yet learnt, only that they make them drink and\r\ndance, with a great deal of Bravery all the begining of the Day, and\r\ntowards Night cut off their Heads, but whether by that they mean the\r\ncommon way of their Executions I am yet to seek.\r\n\r\nAfter the Kings Funeral, the next thing was to chuse a Successor; so\r\nthe People was called together at _Feton_, (I suppose by the Authority\r\nof the Dy) without inquiring any thing of their Freehold; they pitched\r\nupon Mr. _Dy_, though he was not of the Blood-Royal; the Reason was, as\r\nthey said, because he had Power enough to do what he pleas'd, and they\r\ncould do nothing against him; but he refused the Honour because of the\r\nCharge 'twould put him to, and propos'd the Brother of the deceased\r\nKing: So the Business stuck some time, but at last 'twas accorded, and\r\nhe [King _Ashrive_'s Brother] declared King, _Nov. 18._ his Name is\r\n_Ahenaco_.\r\n\r\n'Tis Wonder how they could dispatch such a Business, with so little\r\nDisturbance; but I suppose there was no considerable Number that\r\ndissented; otherwise it would scarce have been determined without\r\nBlood-shed; for it would scarce have been possible for them to have\r\ntaken any Pole.\r\n\r\nI said it was doubt whether these Sacrifices died after the rate of\r\ntheir ordinary Executions; if you would know that, thus it is, the\r\nCreature that is condemn'd, is made to drink abundance of Palm-Wine,\r\nand to dance, every Body that will, in the mean time striking or\r\npushing him, when that is over, as is said, he is thrown down, his Face\r\ninto the Sand, which whether it stifle him or not, I can't tell, then\r\nhis Legs are cut off below the Knees, and his Arms below the Elbow,\r\nafterward his Thigh and his Arms below the Shoulder, lastly his Head.\r\n\r\nA Man would not expect any thing more barbarous than this; yet there\r\nis a Custom which has something worse; when any one has new Drums or\r\nTrumpets, 'tis necessary that they be consecrated with Humane Blood: I\r\nhave known but one happen of this Kind, that was _Jan. 7. 1686/7._ when\r\nafter the Man had been executed after the former rate, about Eight in\r\nthe Morning; at one in the Afternoon, they drank Palm-Wine out of the\r\nupper part of his Skull, and this in the sight of all the Factors at\r\n_Cape Corse_.\r\n\r\nI remember for the Unhealthiness of the Place, you proposed to inquire\r\nif it were Woody, and if any good might be done to it by cutting down\r\nthe Woods, as has happen'd in many _American_ Plantations; of that\r\nMatter this is what I can say.\r\n\r\nThe Shore lies almost East and West, expos'd to the Sea wholly upon\r\nthe South, the Country is Hilly, the Hills not very high, but thick,\r\nclustering together, the Valleys between extream narrow, the whole\r\nin a manner cover'd with certain Shrubs, low, but very thick; what\r\nthe People Till, comes not to above a Tenth part of their Ground; and\r\nwhere they do Till, it hinders not that within half a Year the Ground\r\nis over-grown as before, for they do not root up the Shrubs, but only\r\ncut, or sometimes burn them somewhat close to the Earth, so they spring\r\nagain in a very little time; this is sufficient for their planting the\r\nCorn, which they do by making little Holes in the Earth at a competent\r\nDistance, and putting Seeds into them.\r\n\r\nIt may be that if those Shrubs were destroyed, the Matter might be\r\nmended, which yet is not to be hop'd for, but by bringing the People to\r\nsome kind of Industry, and that will not be easie; they are so wholly\r\ngiven to Laziness, and so intirely bred up in it, that there must be\r\nthe greatest Change imaginable, before they become any whit tolerable;\r\na Man may see their Temper by this, that though their Tillage be very\r\neasie, and the Earth yields many Hundreds for One, yet so little is\r\nthe use they make of it, that One scarce Year brings them to danger of\r\nStarving, and though there be People enough, and every Man has Power of\r\nchoosing what he will, that is not already Till'd by some other, yet\r\nnot the Tenth Part, as we have said, is employed: So that a Man would\r\nwonder what came in the French Man's Head to fancy them Industrious;\r\nbut subtile they are, and diligent to Cheat any Man that is not\r\ncautious enough to avoid it.\r\n\r\nSo that the Fault of the Wood is (by the Laziness of the People)\r\nwithout any Remedy. But there may be something in the Earth it self;\r\nthe Water which they have here in Pits (Rain-Water for the most\r\npart, but yet strain'd through the Earth) has a kind of Taste mixt\r\nof Sweet and Subacid, if I understand what I say, I am told 'tis of\r\nVitriol, whether that be mischievous, you know better than I do. But\r\nI take this for certain, since I have had it from good Hands, that at\r\n_Widdah_, which is one of the most unhealthy Places in _Guiney_, but\r\n'tis not upon the Gold-coast, he that opens the Ground, though it be\r\nbut to dig a Grave, runs the Hazard of his Life: So mischievous are the\r\nSteams from thence arising. It's possible there may be some such Steams\r\nhere, only not so violent; though in _England_ I think, a Gravel or a\r\nSand (which here are always uppermost for as much as I have seen) are\r\nesteem'd very wholesom Soils; under them is a kind of whitish Marle\r\nalmost like Fullers-Earth.\r\n\r\nFor the Air, except what I have said before, I do not know what Fault\r\nit has; 'tis extream hot, 'tis also subtile and piercing, and I believe\r\nenters a Man's Body easier than that in _England_. It has been clearer\r\nthan that uses to be one day with another, even this last Year, which\r\nhas been the wettest and most cloudy which has happen'd a long time;\r\nI think to give you an Account of the Weather in it as soon as I have\r\ntime to transcribe.\r\n\r\nFor the Age of the Inhabitants, 'tis very uncertain, because none of\r\nthem keep an Account of it; there are some of them very Grey, but if\r\nthe Country be to them unhealthy, Grey Hairs may come early: I think\r\nthere be many more Funerals here than at _Oxford_, though that be a\r\nmuch larger Place, especially in the Rain-times, which to us are always\r\nhealthful.\r\n\r\nI think that much of the Mortality (not all) that happens among\r\nStrangers, is the Effect of their ill Diet, and ill Government of\r\nthemselves; for they eat but little, having neither Stomach nor Mony\r\nto buy what they want; but they drink excessively, being for that more\r\nreadily trusted, and of Liquors very hot and Spirituous; and if any\r\nchuse the cold rather, his Stomach is chil'd, and he is in danger of a\r\nFlux or an extream Looseness, and that immediately.\r\n\r\nThere is another thing, Men guard themselves less from the Air than\r\nin any other Places trusting to the Heat of the Climate, and receive\r\nthe cool of the Evening with only a Shirt. Now I think that the Air,\r\ntho' not so cold, is much more subtle and piercing here, than in our\r\nCountry, it corrodes Iron much more, not by the Moisture, for it is not\r\nso moist, and besides it does it in the dry Weather too. Perhaps there\r\nare some other Effects to evidence the same thing; besides that, the\r\nDiet which most Men procure, is not extraordinary, and the passing by\r\nCanoes from one Place to another has a Danger in it beside that of the\r\nSea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                            _Cape Corse, Apr. 25. 1688._\r\n\r\nI Promised in my last to give you an Account of the Weather at _Cape\r\nCorse_ for the last Year, which Account I have inclosed in this; it\r\nis as exact as I could give; 'tis a thing which has been very little\r\nobserved, whether it deserves to be more, I do not know. That Year has\r\nhad the most Rain of any that can be here remember'd; yet the Mortality\r\nwas much less than the Years before; so that perhaps Wet is not that\r\nwhich makes the Country unhealthy; though we had very many Sick,\r\nespecially in _June_ and _July_, whose Diseases were not Mortal.\r\n\r\nIf you give your self the Trouble to read the inclosed, you will find\r\noften mention of a Tornada, which is a violent Storm of Wind, followed\r\ncommonly by Rain, but not always; the Wind ceases not presently upon\r\nthe Rain, but after sometimes it does: In this Place it comes (as\r\ndoes an Hermitan) most frequently from the North, taking in the next\r\nPoints, whether to the East or West, but chiefly the East, though I\r\nhave seen both that and an Hermitan from other Points; so the Account\r\nis not without Exception; there are in it short, uncertain Blasts from\r\nall Quarters, which I believe reach not many Yards, but the general\r\nWind (for ought that I see) is not so unconstant; Vessels that go to\r\nWindward are help'd by them, when they are not over strong, for they\r\nare opposite to the Sea Breze, and they can steer by them a regular\r\nCourse; which sure they could not do, if they were very irregular.\r\nThey never fail to give warning before hand, though sometimes after\r\nthat warning they do not follow; there is a very black Cloud appears\r\nafar, in which if there be a kind of white Spot, the Wind will be\r\nmoist, if not the Rain; this the Sailors say. Sometimes there is that\r\nMark, sometimes not, though I doubt the Prediction from it is not very\r\ncertain; as neither are any perhaps of that kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _An Account of the Weather at _Cape Corse_ in _Guiney_, from Nov.\r\n    24. 1686. to the same Day, 1687._\r\n\r\n\r\nLat.

At the same Hour, Rain which lasted somewhat longer.\r\n\r\n28. About 5. _a. m._ Some Rain, afterward Misty, about 10. extream hot.\r\n\r\n29. About 2. _a. m._ a great storm of Rain, slacking often but renewing\r\nagain, it lasted about an Hour; the Day after clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n_December, 1686._\r\n\r\nThence to _Dec. 7._ clear; then cloudy in the Morning; between 12. and\r\n1. _p. m._ a Shower lasting about ½ Hour. Thence clear and hot.\r\n\r\n10. A little Mist in the Morning, otherwise very clear and hot; so till\r\n15.\r\n\r\n15. And some Days after somewhat thick, especially in the Morning.\r\n\r\n19, And 20. We had a dry North, and North-Easterly Wind, call'd an\r\nHermitan, and it overcame the Sea-Breeze; found very ill for the Eyes,\r\nand most Men complained of a Feverish Temper; it was parching, but\r\nrather colder than ordinary.\r\n\r\n21. It ceased; a clear Air and very hot.\r\n\r\n23. We had the Hermitan again; but the Morrow it ceased; then and\r\n\r\n25. Some Clouds, but no Rain.\r\n\r\nThence to 29. clear and hot; 29. the Hermitan returned, but did not\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\nThence Clouds sometimes, but no Rain till _Jan. 2._\r\n\r\nThis Month we had Three Funerals, one being Sick of the Flux laid\r\nviolent Hands upon himself, through impatience of the Pain, the 3d Day.\r\n\r\nThe Second upon the 25th died convulsively, not having been Sick above\r\none Day.\r\n\r\nThe Third, _Dec. 27._ died of a Dropsy, which had succeeded a tedious\r\nFlux.\r\n\r\n\r\n_January, 1686/7._\r\n\r\n2.

At 7. _p. m._ a Tornada for above ½ Hour, and about 12. at Night\r\nanother; but the Heat very little abated.\r\n\r\n22. Between 5. and 6. _p. m._ began a Tornada, which lasted above an\r\nHour very violent, with great Claps of Thunder and Lightning. Tank\r\nfill'd 1 Foot.\r\n\r\n23. In the Morning a great Mist, after 8. clear and extream hot.\r\n\r\nThe latter end of _January_, and the begining of _February_ commonly\r\nMisty in the Morning; after extream hot.\r\n\r\nI find no Funeral this Month.\r\n\r\n\r\n_February, 1686/7._\r\n\r\nBeginning of _February_, as before.\r\n\r\n10. Somewhat Cloudy and cool, till then we were troubled with Coughs,\r\nfor the most part; about this time they ceased.\r\n\r\nSo the 11th, toward Night, Thunder afar off, and expectation of a\r\nTornada: but it fail'd.\r\n\r\n12. Extream hot.\r\n\r\n13. A stronger Wind than ordinary from Seaward.\r\n\r\n14. Something like an Hermitan, but not from its usual Quarter. Clear\r\nand hot till about 2. _p. m._ then cloudy but no Rain.\r\n\r\nThence to 22. extream hot and clear.\r\n\r\nFrom 22. to _March 1._ some flying clouds without Rain; sultry hot and\r\nunwholesom.\r\n\r\n24. Some shew of a Tornada, but it past away.\r\n\r\nThis Month we had two Funerals, but their Diseases I find not.\r\n\r\n\r\n_March, 1686/7._\r\n\r\nThe beginning of _March_ as the latter end of _February_.\r\n\r\n5.

About 4. _a. m._ a gentle Shower but lasted not long.\r\n\r\n15. Between 6. and 7. _a. m._ a few Drops, and likelyhood of more, but\r\nnothing followed; both Days cloudy.\r\n\r\n16.

About 7. _a. m._ some Drops; cloudy all Day.\r\n\r\n10. Cloudy about 11. _a. m._ a small Mist.\r\n\r\n11. Presently after Midnight it began to Rain and lasted till 6. _a.\r\nm._ a great part of the time very violently, it began with a strong\r\nTornada; Tank above Three Feet. The Day after some Clouds; otherwise\r\nextream hot.\r\n\r\nSo also 12, and 13.\r\n\r\n14. About 5. _a. m._ a Shower for ½ Hour, between 6. and 7. _p. m._\r\nanother of the same continuance, the Day between extream hot.\r\n\r\nSo 15. 16.

Clear also, about 7. _p. m._ a considerable Wind and some Drops of\r\nRain.\r\n\r\n20. Clear but Windy.\r\n\r\n21. Between 12. and 2. moderate Rain for near an Hour.\r\n\r\n22. About 2. _a. m._ moderate Rain almost an Hour; at 11. _p. m._ a\r\nshort Shower and gentle; the Day between extream hot.\r\n\r\n23. Cloudy about 10. _a. m._ some Drops.\r\n\r\n24.

At 7. _a. m._ strong Rain for ½ Hour, after that a little Mist;\r\nAfternoon, from 12. to 15. it rain'd unequally, but the most part\r\nmoderate.\r\n\r\n27. Extream hot.\r\n\r\n28. About 12. Somewhat Cloudy, at 3. _p. m._ it began to Rain, and\r\nlasted about an Hour and ½; after cloudy and some Drops; in the Night a\r\nShower or two.\r\n\r\n29. Cloudy. Thence to _May 6._ sometimes cloudy; but for the most part\r\nviolent hot.\r\n\r\nThis Month we had Three Funerals; one the 3d of a Fever, another on the\r\n19th of I know not what Pains in the Guts, another 24. of the Flux.\r\n\r\nThe 15. and some Days following, there settled upon the Castle Walls,\r\ncertain Swarms of wing'd Ants, a little bigger than Bees; they would\r\nbite very severely, and were blown up with Powder.\r\n\r\n\r\n_May, 1687._\r\n\r\nTill the 6. as before.\r\n\r\n6. In the Morning cloudy, a little after Noon some Wind, followed by\r\ngentle Rain, which lasted till 3. _p. m._ after cloudy.\r\n\r\n7. Hot. 8. Cloudy about 10. _a. m._ a gentle Shower for ¾ Hour; about\r\n8. _p. m._ a very violent Storm of Wind and Rain, but it quickly grew\r\nmoderate, and lasted in all not above ½ Hour. 9. Clear.\r\n\r\n10. About Noon a violent Shower for ¼ of an Hour; after 8. _p. m._\r\nanother as long, but not so violent; past 9. another shorter.\r\n\r\n11. Clear. 12. Clear, past 9. _p. m._ a very Violent Tornada with Rain,\r\nwhich lasted somewhat more than 2 Hours.\r\n\r\n13. Between 12. and 1. in the Night, a short Shower; about 9. _a. m._\r\nsome Drops; so also in the Afternoon but nothing considerable; cloudy\r\nall Day.\r\n\r\n14. Cloudy; at 9. _a. m._ a violent Rain for ¼; after gentle for above\r\nan Hour; about 3. _p. m._ some Drops.\r\n\r\n15. About 3. _a. m._ Rain for ½ Hour; between 4. and 5. another; after\r\nfoggy and cloudy, with some few Drops; about 7. _p. m._ a violent\r\nTornada with Rain for near an Hour.\r\n\r\n16. About 4. _a. m._ Rain for an Hour; after 8. for ¼ Hour; after 6.\r\n_p. m._ Rain and Wind, but both moderate, for ½ Hour; past 8. about as\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n17. About 4. _a. m._ a short Shower, after clear; 18. clear.\r\n\r\n19. Cloudy, about 10. _a. m._ some Drops.\r\n\r\n20. Cloudy between 8. and 10. _a. m._ a Shower; first violent, after\r\nmore moderate, till it ended in a kind of Mist; it lasted in all about\r\n1½ Hour; the Day after clear, 21, and 22. clear.\r\n\r\n23. In the Afternoon cloudy; about 6. _p. m._ some Drops; the Night\r\nafter, a Shower, not considerable.\r\n\r\n24. Hot, about 10. _p. m._ a little Shower.\r\n\r\n25. Clear; 26. in the Night some little Rain.\r\n\r\n27. Held up; 28. at 9. _p. m._ a short Shower.\r\n\r\n29. At 5. _a. m._ Rain till near 7. a little past 7. till 9. after\r\ncloudy.\r\n\r\n30. Cloudy; the Night after some Rain.\r\n\r\n31. About 8. _a. m._ Rain for ½ Hour; from 9. till 12. it rained for\r\nthe most part very violently; before 1. another Shower for ½ Hour; from\r\na little after 2. till 5. with very great Thunder.\r\n\r\nOne Funeral on the 25th after but Three Days Sickness, of which I can\r\ngive no account.\r\n\r\nThe beginning of this Month, we had an extraordinary Number of Toads,\r\nwhich after some time were not to be seen.\r\n\r\nThe 14th we had wing'd Ants, as before.\r\n\r\n24. Was the first Corn, the Seed-time having been the middle of _March_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_June, 1687._\r\n\r\n1. About 4. _a. m._ Rain for an Hour; past 1. _p. m._ for ½ Hour; the\r\nrest cloudy and misty.\r\n\r\n2. From 2. _a. m._ till 5. continual Rain, 'tis said there was some\r\nbefore; from 9. _a. m._ till ½ Hour past 6. _p. m._ continual Rain,\r\nsometimes very fierce; from ½ Hour past 9 at Night, Rain till past 10.\r\n\r\n3. From 6. to a little past 7. _a. m._ a very gentle Rain, from thence\r\ntill 1. _p. m._ most commonly very fierce; thence for a little while\r\nmore moderate; but it rain'd hard again till 6. _p. m._ then it drop'd\r\nbut slowly, and so continued till about 7. in the Night some little\r\nRain.\r\n\r\n4. About 8. _a. m._ some Drops, thence clear.\r\n\r\n6, And 7. clear, except some few flying Clouds.\r\n\r\n8. After 3. _a. m._ gentle Rain for near an Hour; then cloudy and some\r\nDrops, after 10. _p. m._ a Shower.\r\n\r\n9. At 5. _a. m._ a gentle Shower, lasted till past 7. thence a very\r\nviolent Rain till almost 9. some Drops after that; about 3. _p. m._ it\r\nbegan and rain'd till past 10. somewhat moderately.\r\n\r\n10. Clear and hot.\r\n\r\n11. Cloudy; about 8. _p. m._ a few Drops.\r\n\r\n12. From about 2. _a. m._ till near 5. Rain, but not violent; a little\r\nbefore 6. a furious Storm of Rain, but little Wind; it lasted till ½\r\nHour past 7. about 3. _p. m._ a moderate Rain, till a little past 4.\r\nand from thence to 6. somewhat more than a Mist; the Night after it\r\nrained a little.\r\n\r\n13. Cloudy; in the Afternoon it drop'd a little.\r\n\r\n14. About 8. _a. m._ a few Drops.\r\n\r\n15. Somewhat cloudy.\r\n\r\n16. Extream hot; toward Night cloudy; about 5. _p. m._ a violent Shower\r\nfor ½ Hour; from a little before 8. till past 10. it rained continually.\r\n\r\n17. From 4. _a. m._ till almost 6. gentle Rain; so from a little past\r\n6. till past 7. thence till past 3. _p. m._ cloudy, and now and then\r\nsome Drops; then a violent Shower for ⅛th of an Hour; half an Hour\r\nafter 4. it rain'd again and continued till past 10. for the most part\r\nvery furiously; with some little Intermission it rain'd all Night.\r\n\r\n18. At 3. _a. m._ it rained very fiercely; about ½ Hour after 6. it\r\nheld up, but cloudy still; from 8. _a. m._ till past 3. _p. m._ it\r\nrained, but moderately; then it held up a little, but rained after till\r\npast 6. all Day cloudy, and at Night a great Fog.\r\n\r\n19. About 9. _a. m._ some Drops; from 1. till past 3. _p. m._ very\r\ngentle Rain.\r\n\r\nThence to the First of _July_, foggy, Morning, sometimes hot, but for\r\nthe most cloudy, and more temperate than could be expected from the\r\nClimate.\r\n\r\nTwo Funerals, one the 9th of an Asthma; the other 21. of a Fever.\r\n\r\nWe saw some Sorts of Insects not usual here, whether monstrous or not,\r\nI cannot tell. The most notable, a kind of Spider, about the Bigness of\r\na Beetle, the Form nearest of a Crab-fish, with an odd kind of Orifice\r\nvisible in the Belly, whence the Web proceeded.\r\n\r\n\r\n_July, 1687._\r\n\r\n1. Extream hot.\r\n\r\n2. Foggy in the Morning; about 9. _a. m._ a few Drops; after clear.\r\n\r\n3.

About 4. _a. m._ a little Rain, the Day after as before; from 8. _p.\r\nm._ till 10. moderate Rain.\r\n\r\n3. Cloudy; about 10. _a. m._ Rain for somewhat more than an Hour.\r\n\r\n4.

Cloudy. 23. Clear and hot.\r\n\r\n24. Somewhat cloudy; at 7. _p. m._ a little Rain.\r\n\r\n25. Cloudy; about 11. _a. m._ Expectation of a Tornada, with some\r\nThunder, but it ended in a few Drops of Rain about 1. _p. m._\r\n\r\n26.

And 30. hot, yet with some Clouds.\r\n\r\n30.

In the Morning very hot; about 2. _p. m._ a violent Tornada, with\r\nRain and Thunder very near; it ceased sometimes, but beginning again,\r\nlasted till near 4. _p. m._ afterward cloudy.\r\n\r\nThree Funerals, all upon the 6th Day, Two of Fevers, the other I know\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n\r\n_November, 1687._\r\n\r\nClear and extream hot till the 6th.\r\n\r\n6. About half an Hour past 1. in the Morning a very violent Rain for\r\nmore than an Hour.\r\n\r\nThence to 14. except that the 11th at Night there were some few Drops,\r\nvery hot.\r\n\r\n14. Extream hot, about 9. _p. m._ a little Shower; the same Night about\r\n1. a smart Rain for an Hour and half.\r\n\r\n15. Hot; toward Night Cloudy and Foggy.\r\n\r\nThence to 19. very hot.\r\n\r\n19. Some likelihood of a Tornada, but nothing followed.\r\n\r\n20. About 1. _p. m._ a short Shower; about a quarter past 2. another\r\nnot much longer; till Night Cloudy.\r\n\r\nThence to 26. no Rain, but cloudy and somewhat cooler; yet some Days\r\nextream hot.\r\n\r\n26. About 10. _p. m._ a short Shower.\r\n\r\n27. About 2. another; the rest clear.\r\n\r\n30. About 2. _a. m._ fierce Rain for about ½ Hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _An Account of the _Moorish_ Way of Dressing their Meat (with other\r\n    Remarks) in _West-Barbary_, from Cape _Spartel_ to Cape _de\r\n    Geer_. _By Mr._ Jezreel Jones._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Mauritanian_ or _Barbarian Moor_, when he rises in the Morning,\r\nwashes himself all over, and dresses, then goes to their _Jiama_, or\r\nChurch, says his Prayers, and returns home, where his Wife, Concubine,\r\nor Slave, hath his Breakfast provided for him, which is sometimes made\r\nof Barly or Wheat-Gruel; for I have known both. It is made somewhat\r\nthicker than ours, till it be ropy; they put Origan, and other Herbs,\r\npowder'd, into it, which for such uses they keep dry'd all the Year;\r\nsome will put a little Pepper, and other Spice. I have often been\r\ntreated with warm Bread, fresh Butter, and Honey, in a Morning, which\r\nis not seldom used among themselves, an Hour or two after they have\r\nhad Gruel; as also Hasty-Pudding, with Butter, and sometimes Butter\r\nand Honey, (as the Guests are, and according to the Ability of the\r\nEntertainers.) Some again give _Cuscusoo_, with Milk, others with\r\nFlesh, a third with Roots. It is to be observed, when any one hath\r\na Guest or Guests in his House, the Neighbours bring their Dish to\r\nwelcome him or them, on account of the Respect and Love they bear\r\nto their Neighbour, as well as to shew their Readiness to entertain\r\nthe Stranger. This Practice is found constantly used throughout the\r\nwhole Country among the _Moors_, one towards another, reciprocally.\r\nAnd I have as often found the like Civility, as I had occasion to\r\ntake up my Lodging at any Place, where I was acquainted with any\r\nof the Inhabitants. The _Jews_ likewise shew great Civility to any\r\n_Christian_, and treat him with what they have, as stew'd or bak'd\r\nHens, Capons, hard Eggs, boil'd or roasted, which they press flat with\r\nPepper, and Salt, Wine, Brandy, _&c._ They have generally the best\r\nBread, and every thing else of the kind that they can get. They put\r\nAnnis, and two or three other sorts of Seeds, in their Bread; one is\r\nblack and angled, tastes almost like Carrot-seeds, and I think I have\r\nseen these sometimes used in Bread in _Spain_; I know not the Names\r\nof the other Seeds in _English_, nor any Language but _Arabick_. They\r\nesteem Honey as a wholsome Breakfast, and the most delicious that which\r\nis in the Comb, with the young Bees in it, before they come out of\r\ntheir Cases, whilst they still look Milk-white, and resemble (being\r\ntaken out) Gentles, such as Fishers use: These I have often eat of, but\r\nthey seem'd insipid to my Palate, and sometimes I found they gave me\r\nthe Heart-burn.\r\n\r\nIn _Suse_ I had a Bag of Honey brought by a Friend who made a Present\r\nof it, as being of great Esteem, and such as they present to Men of\r\ngreatest Note among them. This, he told me, I was to eat a little of\r\nevery Morning, to the quantity of a Walnut; it was thick as _Venice_\r\nTreacle, and full of small Seeds. I used to breakfast on it for several\r\nDays together, taking the said quantity at a time; it always made me\r\nsleepy, but I found my self well, and in very good temper of Body after\r\nit. The Seeds were about the bigness of Mustard, and, according to the\r\nDescription of them to me, and the Effects I found by eating the Honey\r\nand them, they must be a large sort of Poppy-seed. The Honey was of\r\nthat sort they call in _Suse_, _Izucanee_, or _Origanum_, which (the\r\nBees feed on) and these Seeds were mixed with.\r\n\r\n_Cuscus_, or _Cusksoo_, is the principal Dish among them, as the _Olla_\r\nis in _Spain_: This is made of Flower of Wheat, and when that is\r\nscarce, of Barley, Millet, _Indian_ Corn, _&c._ They shake some Flower\r\ninto an earthen Pan, made on Purpose, which is not glazed, sprinkling\r\na little Water on the bottom of the Pan first, and then working it\r\nwith both their open Hands flat, turning them backwards and forwards\r\nto grain it, 'till they make it much resembling _Sago_, which comes\r\nfrom the _East-Indies_. They stew their Flesh keeping their Pots close\r\ncovered, which are made of Earth, put the _Cusksoo_ into an earthen\r\nCullender, which they call _Caskass_, B. _vid._ Fig. and this Cullender\r\ninto the Mouth of the Pot, C. that so all the Steam which arises from\r\nthe Meat may be imbibed by the _Cusksoo_, which causes it to swell, and\r\nmake it fit to be eaten: When it is enough, for they love every thing\r\nthoroughly done, they put this _Cusksoo_ out into the Dish they serve\r\nit up in, which is somewhat like D. and the _Cusksoo_ being heaped up,\r\nthey make (as it were) a Bed or Place for the Meat to lie in, then they\r\nput good store of Spice, as Ginger, Pepper, Saffron, _&c._ This Dish\r\nis set upon a Mat on the Ground, and four Men may easily sit about it,\r\ntho' I have seen six and more at one Dish; they sit with their Buttocks\r\nupon the Calves of their Legs, with the bottom of their Feet on the\r\nGround. If there are many to eat at this Meal, there are more Dishes.\r\nThis Dish they have in use sometimes at Breakfast, as well as Dinner\r\nand Supper, but it is commonly used for the two last Meals. They cover\r\nit with a thing made on purpose, somewhat like E. and it will keep hot\r\nenough two Hours. At a stately Entertainment they will have a Sheep\r\nroasted whole, sometimes a half, or a quarter, on a wooden Spit, or\r\nthe most convenient thing they can find. They do not continually keep\r\nturning it, as we do, but leisurely let one side be almost roasted\r\nbefore they turn the other. The Fire is commonly of Wood burnt to\r\nclear Coal, and made so, that the Heat ascends to the Meat. They baste\r\nit with Oil, and a little Water and Salt incorporated. They let it\r\nbe thoroughly roasted; then they say, _Bismiillah_, _In the Name of\r\nGod_, after they have washed their Right Hands, and pulling the Meat\r\nin pieces, they fall to eating. It is to be noted, that they never use\r\nbut their Right Hand in eating, and one holds whilst the other pulls\r\nit asunder, distributing the pieces to the rest, as he pulls it off.\r\nThey seldom use a Knife, and a Fork is a strange thing among them. They\r\nare dextrous at this way of carving, and never flinch at the Heat or\r\nwarmth, for that would look mean, and might occasion one more bold to\r\ntake his Office upon him to perform. When they have done, they lick\r\ntheir Fingers, and as often as they have a hot Dish, they wash their\r\nHands afresh. Then they have _Alfdoush_, or _Virmizzelli_, with some\r\nMeat on it, stew'd Meat, well spiced, with savoury Broth; which after\r\nthey have eat the Meat, they dip their Bread in the Sauce, or Broth,\r\nand eat it. They are cleanly in their Cookery, and if a Hair be found\r\nit is a capital Crime, but a Fly not, because it has Wings, and may get\r\nin after it passes from the Cook's Charge or Management; to be well and\r\nstrongly season'd is no great Fault; and if one should say it is too\r\nhigh of Pepper, they'll reply, it is better to be _Ah_ than _Faugh_;\r\nalluding to the Differences between a strong, high, or hot, and savoury\r\nTaste, and an insipid, watry, or unpleasant. _Cubbob_ is small pieces\r\nof Mutton, with the Caul of a Sheep wrapped on them. Some make good\r\n_Cubbob_ of the Liver, Lights, and Heart. They Pepper and Salt them,\r\nand put Sweet Herbs and Saffron into them, and then roast them, and\r\nwhen they dish them up, squeeze an Orange or two on them. Thus they use\r\ncommonly in their stew'd Meats, Lemon and Orange for Roast or Fish.\r\n\r\n_Elmorosia_ is another: This is pieces of Beef, of Cow or Camel, stew'd\r\nwith Butter, Honey, and Water; some will put _Rob_ of Wine among it;\r\nthey add Saffron, Garlick, or Onions, a little Salt, and when 'tis\r\nenough, serve it up. They esteem this a delicious Dish, used mostly in\r\nthe Winter, and say it is good against Colds, notwithstanding they say\r\nBeef is cooler than Mutton. They have a piece of good Housewifery for\r\na ready Dish, which is likewise appropriated to the Winter Season; and\r\nthis I will give an Account of before I have done. Then they will treat\r\nyou with Hare stew'd, stew'd and roasted Hens and Partridges: These\r\nthey disjoint, and let stew in Water, and Oil, or Butter, if they are\r\nnot fat enough of themselves. When they are almost enough, they beat\r\na couple of Eggs, mix them with the Liquor, with Juice of Lemon or\r\nVinegar, which they usually have very good, and serve it up.\r\n\r\nThen you may have more baked and roast, and another Dish of stew'd\r\nMeat, which for its Goodness would be esteem'd among us: They take a\r\nLeg of Mutton, cut off the fleshy part, leave out the Skin and Sinews.\r\nThis Flesh they mince very fine (with two Knives, one in each Hand)\r\nby holding them across, which they manage with great Dexterity; they\r\nalso mince some Suet, Parsly, Thime, Mint, _&c._ Then they take Pepper,\r\nSalt, and Saffron beaten together, and some Nutmeg; all these they add\r\nto the rest, with about half a handful of Rice; they cut an Onion, of\r\nthe best sort, half through, and take off the first Lay, as not so fit\r\nfor use, unless it be thick. (They that are curious take out the inner\r\nSkin, saying it is not wholsome, and bad for the Eyes, it being the\r\nworst thing in an Onion, which otherwise would be the best of Roots.)\r\nThis Lay they fill with forc'd Meat, then the next, and so on, which\r\nmakes them look like so many Onions; some they put up in Vine-leaves\r\nof the best they can find for their purpose. Whilst this is doing, the\r\nBones and Residue of the Leg of Mutton, being in moderate pieces, are\r\nstewing, with as much Water as will just cover them; then they put on\r\ntheir forc'd Meat-Balls a top of the Meat, and a green Bunch of Grapes\r\nupon them, cover it, and let it boil till thoroughly enough. This I\r\nthink, is one of their best Dishes, which they often use in _Fess_ and\r\nother Cities. _Pillowe_, or _Piloe_, is a Dish very well known, made\r\nwith Rice boil'd, with a good Hen, Mutton, and Spice, the Flesh and\r\nFowl being put on the Rice in a Dish as _Cusksoo_, and so served up.\r\n\r\nA Bustard, which they roast and stew, and make an excellent Dish of its\r\nGuts, I eat of it once; to me it seemed very pleasant and savoury, and\r\nvery grateful to the Stomach. This Bird is fit for their King's Table,\r\nas likewise the Hedgehog, of which I will give an Account anon. Then\r\nthey have _Ragous_, made with Sparrows, Pidgeons, _&c._\r\n\r\nTheir Drink is plain Water, or Milk, and sometimes _Rob_ of Wine mixed\r\nwith Water. I was once treated with this by the Bashaw of _Suse_,\r\n_Abdolmeleck ben Alchotib_, and there was brought to me a great Bowl\r\nwhich held above three Quarts; he told me there was not above half a\r\nPint of this _Rob_ in it, and the rest was filled up with Water. It was\r\nvery generous and pleasant, and tho' I did not drink a quarter of it,\r\nyet I found the Strength in half an Hour. This they say is a Remedy\r\nagainst Cold likewise, and pretend to take it medicinally; tho' _Rob_\r\nof Grapes is lawful according to their[20]Law. Under this Pretext, many\r\n_Fessee_ Merchants, to make _Rob_, or Vinegar, press all the Grapes\r\nin their Vineyards, put it up in great Jars, under Ground, and keep\r\nit long, so that it proves excellent Wine. When four or five merry\r\nCompanions, with every one his Mistress, appoint to be merry, they go\r\nout to their Vineyard or Garden, have Musick, and all or most of these\r\nDishes, and there sit and carouse over a great earthen Bowl full of\r\nWine, of about four or five Gallons, and so drink round in a Cup that\r\nwill hold almost a Pint, like a large Tea Dish, till there is none\r\nleft; it often happens that they do not part till they have made an end\r\nof the whole Jar, which seldom is less than a Weeks time. I have known\r\nsome that have been nine Days successively drunk; those that are known\r\nto drink Wine or Piss standing, their Testimony will not be valid in\r\nLaw.\r\n\r\nIn a Morning, during this time of Merriment, they are for some savoury\r\nBit, _Pickled Fish_, or _Escaveche_, or _Elcholle_. They are great\r\nLovers of Fish, and have as great Variety and very good, which they\r\nfry in _Organ Oil_, stew, roast, and bake, with good store of Spice,\r\nOnions, Garlick, Cummin, Parsly, and Coriander. The _Escaveche_, or\r\nfry'd Fish, is cut in thin slices, and put into Vinegar, with the\r\naforesaid Spices, adding Saffron, and Pepper, _&c._ It will keep above\r\na Month, and this they have commonly, as also pickled Limes, Olives,\r\nCapers, _&c._ They eat parched _Garavancas_, parched Almonds, and\r\nBeans, which they parch in a Pan with Water and Salt. These, and other\r\nthings, they have to relish their Glass of Wine, or give them a fresh\r\nAppetite to drink. They say, to cure the ill Effects of a drunken Bout,\r\nis, to take a swinging Cup of the same Liquor, which invites them to\r\nmore, and so on.\r\n\r\nBut I have left some Dishes, by this Digression, to give an Account of\r\ntheir extravagant Mirth.\r\n\r\nThe Hedgehog is a princely Dish among them, and before they kill him\r\nrub his Back against the Ground, by holding its Feet betwixt two, as\r\nMen do a Saw that saws Stones, till it has done Squeaking; then they\r\ncut its Throat, and with a Knife cut off all its Spines and singe it.\r\nThey take out its Guts, stuff the Body with some Rice, sweet Herbs,\r\nGaravancas, Spice, and Onions; they put some Butter and Garavancas\r\ninto the Water they stew it in, and let it stew in a little Pot, close\r\nstopped, till it is enough, and it proves an excellent Dish. The\r\n_Moors_ do not care to kill Lamb, Veal, nor Kid, saying it is a Pity\r\nto part the Suckling from its Dam. They eat with their boil'd Meat,\r\nmany times Carrots, Turnips of two or three sorts, Cabbage, Beans,\r\nand Pease, _&c._ which they have plenty, and very good. I have eat of\r\nPorcupine stewed, which much resembled Camels Flesh in Tast, and that\r\nis the nearest to Beef of any thing I know.\r\n\r\nI come now to give an Account of the _Alcholea_: It is made of Beef,\r\nMutton, or Camel's Flesh, but chiefly Beef, which they cut all in long\r\nslices, salt it well, and let it lie twenty four Hours in the Pickle.\r\nThen they remove out of those Tubs, or Jars, into others with Water,\r\nand when it has lain a Night, they take it out, and put it on Ropes in\r\nthe Sun and Air to dry; when it is thoroughly dri'd, and hard, they cut\r\nit into pieces of two or three Inches long, and throw it into a Pan,\r\nor Chauldron, which is ready, with boiling Oil and Suet sufficient to\r\nhold it, where it boils till it be very clear and red, if one cuts it,\r\nwhich, taken out, they set to drain: When all is thus done, it stands\r\ntill cool, and Jars are prepared to pot it up in, pouring the Liquor\r\nthey fried it in upon it, and as soon as it is thoroughly cold they\r\nstop it up close. It will keep two Years, it will be hard, and the\r\nhardest they look on to be best done. This they dish up cold, sometimes\r\nfry'd with Eggs and Garlick, sometimes stew'd, and Lemon squeezed on\r\nit. It is very good any way, either hot or cold.\r\n\r\nBefore I conclude, I willingly give an Account of their\r\nTravelling-Provision, _viz._ Bread, Almonds, Raisons, Figs, hard Eggs,\r\ncold Fowl, _&c._ But what is most used by Travellers, is _Zumeet_,\r\n_Tumeet_, or Flower of parched Barley for _Limereece_. These are not\r\n_Arabian_ but _Shilha_ Names, so I believe it is of a longer standing\r\nthan the _Mahometans_ in that Part of _Africk_. They are all three\r\nmade of parched Barley Flower, which they carry in a Leather Satchel.\r\n_Zumeet_ is the Flower mixed with Honey, Butter, and Spice; _Tumeet_\r\nis the same Flower done up with _Organ Oil_; and _Limereece_ is only\r\nmixed with Water, and so drank: This quenches Thirst much better than\r\nWater alone, satisfies a hungry Appetite, cools and refreshes tired and\r\nweary'd Spirits, overcoming those ill Effects a hot Sun and fatiguing\r\nJourney might occasion. This among the Mountaineers of _Suse_ is used\r\nfor their Diet as well at home as on their Journey. All things taken\r\nin Game, as Hawking, Hunting, and Fowling, are lawful for them to eat,\r\nif they take it before it be dead, so that they can have time to cut\r\nits Throat, and say, _Bismiillahe_; or if he is known to be an expert\r\nMan at the Game, and says those Words before he lets the Hawk take\r\nits Flight, lets slip the Grey-hound, or fires his Gun, it is lawful;\r\nall (I say, but Swine's Flesh, and what dies of its self) they have\r\nLiberty to eat, and may sell it. They tell us there is but one Part\r\nabout the Hog or Swine that is unlawful, which they do not know, and\r\nare obliged to abstain from the whole; but if they knew it, they would\r\nlet us have but little to our share. They eat Snails boil'd with Salt,\r\nand praise their Wholesomeness. Fish of all sorts, are lawful. In\r\n_Taffilet_ and _Dra_ most of their Food is Dates, there are ten or a\r\ndozen sorts. They have good Capons all the Country over; no Turkeys,\r\nDucks, nor Geese but wild, and those they have of two sorts; Duck,\r\nTeal, and Mallard, Curlews, Plovers, Snipes, Ox-birds, Pipers, a sort\r\nof a black Crow, with a bald Pate, and long crooked Bill, is good\r\nMeat, and a hundred other sort of Fowl. I have eat Antelope, which we\r\nhave kill'd in hunting, and are very good Food. They are as large as\r\na Goat, of a Chestnut Colour, and white under the Belly; their Horns\r\nare almost quite streight from their Head up, tapering gradually, with\r\nRings at a distance from one another, till within an Inch and a half of\r\nthe top; fine large black Eyes, long and slender Neck, Feet, Legs, and\r\nBody, shaped somewhat like a Deer; they have two Cavities between their\r\nLegs, I think the Male as well as the Female. I have sent of these\r\nAntelopes alive to _England_. There are many in a Herd, when at the\r\nsame time they have Scouts, or those who by running give 'em notice of\r\nan approaching Foe. When two lie down together, they lay themselves so,\r\nthat their Backs are towards each other, and the Head of one towards\r\nthe Tail of the other, that they may see every way. Their Dung is sweet\r\nand pleasant enough. They are taken sometimes by the Hawk, sometimes by\r\nthe Shot; for they are too swift for a Grey-hound. Partridges in _Sus_\r\ncommonly roost on Trees; there are so many Foxes which would otherwise\r\ndestroy them.\r\n\r\nAnd here I should make mention of another Dish: The _Moors_ will eat\r\nFox, if it be Fat, either stewed or roasted, but they do not care for\r\nit lean, which has occasioned a Proverb among them on that Account, to\r\nwit, _Hellel deeb, harom deeb_; alluding to the Scruple might be made\r\nof its lawfulness. Those Words signifie, a Fox is lawful, and a Fox is\r\nunlawful; _i. e._ Fat, Lawful; Lean, Unlawful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Lat. 30, or thereabouts.]\r\n\r\nFruits and Sweat-Meats they have of many kinds, as of three or four\r\nsorts of Pumpkins, Macaroons, Almonds prepared many ways, Raisins,\r\nDates, Figs dry and green, excellent Melons of two or three sorts,\r\nand Water-Melons, Pomegranates of several kinds, Apples, Pears,\r\nApricocks, Peaches, Mulberries white and black, Plumbs, and Damascens,\r\nCherries,[21]Grapes of many kinds, and very good, and if they would\r\nassist Nature, they might have every thing in Perfection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTheir Salating is Lettuce, Endive, Carduus, Parsley, Apium, and other\r\nsweet Herbs, Onions, Cucumbers of several kinds, some about a Yard in\r\nlength, and two or three Inches thick, and hairy, (this is esteemed\r\nthe wholesomest) Radishes, _Fumatas_, or Apples of Love, all which\r\nthey will cut, and put Oil, Vinegar, and Salt, with some red Pepper:\r\nThis Salate they eat with Bread. They have a Fruit called _Baraneen_,\r\nin _Spain_, _Baragenas_; these they stew with their Victuals, and\r\nsometimes cut them in thin slices, and fry them; it makes a pretty\r\nDish. When the _Moors_ have feasted, every one washes his Hands and\r\nMouth, thanks God, and blesses the Hosts and Entertainers from whom\r\nthey had it; they talk a little, or tell some Story, and then lie down\r\nto rest, where I shall leave them at present, and do beg your Pardon\r\nfor so tiresome and frivolous a Discourse.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] _Alcoran._\r\n\r\n[21] Grapes in _Messina_ I have known as big as a Pigeon's Egg; but\r\nthey do not make Wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _A Letter from Mr. _John Monro_ to the Publisher, concerning the\r\n    Catacombs of _Rome_ and _Naples_._\r\n\r\n\r\n  _SIR,_\r\n\r\nThe Catacombs are an obscure Argument. I have seen those of _Rome_,\r\nI have seen those of _Naples_, and as they say there are Catacombs\r\nin the Neighbourhood of all the great Towns of that part of _Italy_,\r\nI had been glad to have seen them where-ever they are. They are an\r\nobscure argument indeed; but perhaps the greatest obscurity about them\r\nis, that a Matter that has so much exercis'd the Pens of the Moderns,\r\nshou'd be totally neglected by the Ancients: Neither the name nor the\r\nthing is found in the latter, whereas among the former, Antiquaries\r\nand Travellers are full of them. All they into whose way they come,\r\nthink they do nothing if they do not exhaust them before they leave\r\nthem; they take all their dimensions, and measure their height, their\r\nbreadth and their length; they survey all the little Rooms, search\r\nevery hole and corner, Criticize nicely on the quality, and calculate\r\nthe Age of the poor Painting and Inscriptions, and make excursions into\r\nother Arguments, to find out the end for which they were made. The\r\nCatacombs are a narrow Gallery dug and carried a vast way under Ground,\r\nwith an infinite number of others going off it on all hands, and an\r\ninfinite number of little Rooms going off the Principal, and them too.\r\nThose commonly shew'd Strangers are those of _San Sebastiano_, those of\r\n_San Lorenzo_, those of _San Agnese_, and the others in the Fields a\r\nlittle off of _Sant Agnese_. They take their Names from the Churches in\r\ntheir Neighbourhood, and seem to divide the circumference of the City\r\nwithout the Walls between them, extending their Galleries every where\r\nunder, and a vast way from it, so that all the Ground under, and for\r\nmany Miles about it, is said to be hollow. Now there are two sorts of\r\nAuthors that run into extravagance on this subject; the one will have\r\nthem made by the Primitive Christians, adding, that in the times of\r\nPersecution they liv'd, held their Assemblies, and laid up the Bodies\r\nof their Martyrs and Confessors in them. This is the Account that\r\nprevails at _Rome_, and consequent to it there are Men kept constantly\r\nat Work in them. As soon as these Labourers discover a Repository,\r\nwith any of the marks of a Saint about it, Intimation is given to the\r\nCardinal Treasurer, who immediately sends Men of Probity and Reputation\r\nto the place, where they find a Palm painted or ingraven, or the Cypher\r\nXP, which is commonly read _pro Christo_, or a small round projection\r\nin the side of the Gallery, a little below the Repository; what is\r\nwithin it is carried to the Palace. Many of these Projections we have\r\nseen open, with pieces of the Vials in them; the Glass indeed was\r\ntinctur'd, and 'tis pretended that in these Vials was conserved the\r\nBlood of the Martyrs, which was thus laid up nigh their Bodies, towards\r\nthe Head, to distinguish them from those of the others that were not\r\ncalled to the Honour of laying down their Lives for the Faith of the\r\nGospel. After the Labourers have survey'd a Gallery, they do up the\r\nentry that leads into it; thus most of them are shut; nor are more left\r\nopen than what is necessary to keep up the Trade of shewing them to\r\nStrangers, which they say is done to prevent what has often happen'd,\r\nI mean Peoples losing themselves in these subterraneous Labyrinths; by\r\nthis conduct depriving us of the means of knowing whither and how far\r\nthey were carried. To this it may be justly excepted, that allowing the\r\nCatacombs to be proper for the end for which they are presum'd to be\r\nmade, and that the Christians of that Age were in a capacity of making\r\nthat convenience, for themselves to live and assemble in below Ground,\r\nat a time when 'twas so very unsafe to appear above it; yet to suppose\r\nthat a work of that Vastness and Importance cou'd be carried on without\r\nthe knowledge of the Government, is to suppose the Government asleep,\r\nand that that was actually done under its Nose, that must necessarily\r\nhave alarm'd it, had it been attempted on the frontiers of the Empire.\r\n\r\nThe other sort of Authors give indeed a mighty Idea of the Catacombs,\r\nrepresent them as a work of that Vastness, that the Christians in the\r\npersecuting times had not number enough to carry it on; but then most\r\nunadvisedly with the same breath they confound them with the _Puticuli\r\nin Festus Pompeius_, where, at the same time that the Ancient _Romans_\r\nus'd to burn the Bodies of their dead, the custom was, to avoid\r\nexpence, to throw those of the Slaves to rot.\r\n\r\nThis is not all, the _Roman_ Christians, say they, observing at length\r\nthe great veneration that certain Places gain'd by the presence\r\nof Relicts, resolv'd to provide a stock for themselves; entring\r\ntherefore the Catacombs, they made in some of them what Cyphers, what\r\nInscriptions, what Painting they thought fit, and then shut them up;\r\nintending to open them again upon a Dream, or some other important\r\nincident. The few that were in the secret of this Artifice either\r\ndying, or as the Monks, who were the only Men that seem to have had\r\nHeads adapted to a thought of this quality, were subject to so many\r\nremoves, being transported to other Places, the contrivance came to be\r\nforgot, and those Galleries continu'd shut, till Chance, the Parent\r\noften of great discoveries, open'd them at last. Thus they conclude,\r\nthe Remains of the vilest part of Mankind are trump'd up in the Church\r\nfor the Bodies of the most eminent Confessors and Martyrs.\r\n\r\nTo leave the latter part of this Tale to shift for it self as well\r\nas it can, either the Catacombs are not that great work they are\r\nrepresented to be, nor to be found every where about the City, or\r\n'twas very improper in _Festus Pompeius_ to call them by the little\r\nname of _Puticuli_, and so confine them to one place only, that I mean\r\nunknown now without the _Esquilin_-Gate. Indeed the Characters of the\r\nPlaces are so very unlike, that one wou'd wonder how a common Burying\r\nplace, where in holes Bodies were thrown together to rot, came to be\r\nconfounded with Repositories cut in the face of a long Gallery, one\r\nover another, sometimes to the number of seven, in which Bodies were\r\nsingly laid, and handsomly done up again, so that nothing cou'd offend\r\nthe view of those that went in, especially with the little Rooms of\r\nthe fashion of Chappels, that have all the Appearances of being the\r\nSepulchers of People of distinction.\r\n\r\nThe Remark, _Puticulos Antiquissimum sepulturæ genus appellatos, quod\r\nibi in puteis sepirentur homines_, is that of an Etymologist, that\r\nwould be now thought to speak against all the property of Language,\r\nif he apply'd the name to our Graves or Vaults, to which it may with\r\nmore Justice and Reason be apply'd, than to the Galleries of the\r\nCatacombs, and the Rooms that go off them. What the particulars were\r\nis not difficult to define, after what we have seen so often. When the\r\nPersecutors spilt the Blood of so many Martyrs, they us'd to dig holes\r\nperpendicularly in the Ground, and to throw their Bodies promiscuously\r\nin them; of this the Memory is still conserv'd, Churches being built in\r\nthe Places where the holes were made, and little Monuments erected over\r\nthe holes themselves, to which the name of _Putei_ is continued to this\r\nday.\r\n\r\nThis is the true notion of the _Puticuli_, holes dug perpendicularly\r\nin the Ground to throw Bodies indifferently and without any decency\r\nin; and according to the Argument this ought to be the conduct of the\r\nAncient _Romans_, with Respect to their Slaves, as implying simplicity\r\nand the care to avoid a greater expence; but then what's all this\r\nto the Galleries and Chambers of the Catacombs, where decency and\r\ndistinction of quality is nicely observ'd; and that, if they were\r\nlook'd after, and kept in better repair, would be without dispute the\r\nnoblest Burying-place this Day in the World? As often as they fall\r\nunder my consideration, I cannot forbear thinking they were made for\r\nthis end by the Ancient _Romans_, and made in consequence of these two\r\nAncient opinions, that the shadows hate the light, and love to hover\r\nabout the place where the Bodies are laid, they appear so easie and\r\ndecent a resting-place for the one, without the least fear of being\r\never disturb'd, and at the same time there is provided a noble and a\r\nvast convenience full of variety for the others, to space themselves\r\nfreely and with pleasure in.\r\n\r\nI think 'twill not be denied, that laying up the Bodies in Caves\r\nwas the original way of disposing of the dead; this was that of the\r\n_Phænicians_, and as they were the Men that with their Colonies peopled\r\nthe Western parts of the World, 'tis more than probable they carried\r\nit along with them whither soever they went. Afterwards, as Men grew\r\ngreat and powerful, they erected noble and magnificent Monuments\r\nfor themselves above ground; at length others of inferior degree\r\nimitated them, all leaving room enough and excluding the light: But\r\nthen interring as we do now in the open Air, or in Temples, was never\r\nthe manner till Christianity brought it in. Of the whole we have many\r\nInstances, and _Il Signior Abbate Bencini_, Bibliothecary of the\r\n_Propaganda_, a Gentleman of good Ancient Learning, assured me in the\r\nconversation I had with him on this Argument, that on the great Roads\r\nin most parts of _Italy_ little Catacombs have been and are still\r\nfound under ground, and that 'twas the Custom to build little Houses\r\nover them. This, and the testimony of the Labourers whom I consulted\r\non the matter, made me abandon an opinion of which I was once fond,\r\nthat the Catacombs are of the Nature of our Gravel-pits, as old as the\r\nCity itself, and yet out of them was taken the _Puzzolana_, the famous\r\nIngredient in the _Roman_ Mortar. The same learned Gentleman added,\r\nrelating to the marks of a Martyr, that they don't conclude much;\r\nthat the so fam'd Cypher XP was in use among the Ancients long before\r\nChristianity begun: And when I ask'd him what the meaning of it might\r\nbe among them? return'd, that 'twas compos'd of the two _Greek_ Letters\r\nΧ Ρ, under which something mystical was comprehended, but that he met\r\nwith no Author that gave account what the mystery was.\r\n\r\nThus, after a multitude of thoughts about the Catacombs, I'm forced to\r\ntake up with this; so natural it is, arising from the sole Theory of\r\nthe Place, and falls in so oppositely with the Religion and Practice\r\nof the Ancients, among whom the _Dii Manes_ were the Tutelary Gods of\r\nthe Country, and _D. M._ at the head of an Inscription, argues the\r\nMoles, the Sepulchre, the Monument, _&c._ was in the primary intention\r\nmade for and dedicated to the Soul. Upon the same Maxims, in Foreign\r\nexpeditions, when a Hero died or was kill'd, as the Body was liable\r\nto a quick corruption, and for that Reason unfit to be transported\r\nentire, they fell on the expedient of Burning, in order to bring home\r\nthe Ashes, to oblige the _Manes_ to follow, that so the Country might\r\nnot be deprived of the Benefit of its tutelage. This I humbly conceive\r\nwas the Original of Burning, which by Degrees became more and more\r\nuniversal, till at last the Pomp and Magnificence of it reconcil'd it\r\nto all that were able to go to the length of the expence.\r\n\r\nAs for the prejudice of the Silence of the Ancient Authors in this\r\nmatter, 'tis easily removed, and to be regretted at the same time\r\nthat the Authors of all Ages, too much neglect the customs of their\r\nown time. Writing for the satisfaction of their Cotemporaries, they\r\nthink it impertinent to Trouble them with the Account of what they see\r\nTransacted every Day. By this means the Ancient Customs, with the Time,\r\nand Reasons of their disuse, are lost with Respect to us, and ours with\r\nthe same Circumstances may come to be so with relation to Posterity.\r\nAs the Authors are pleas'd to adopt them for their Children, one wou'd\r\nwonder greater care is not taken not to entail visible occasions of\r\ncomplaint on them; nay, one wou'd wonder more, to see these Gentlemen\r\nso little ambitious of a future reputation, when they may infallibly\r\nassure it themselves, without resigning the present, by transmitting\r\nthe knowledge of things, the knowledge of which may in a small series\r\nof Years become otherwise irretrievable; they cannot but observe every\r\nDay what esteem is placed on those Authors, to whom we are forced to\r\ngo, to find in them what cannot be found elsewhere, to compare with the\r\nothers, in whom nothing is to be found, but what Men of Reason are able\r\nto find at home.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, the Catacombs I humbly conceive were the Burying-places\r\nof the Ancient _Romans_; at length the manner of Burning, which they\r\nreceived from the _Græcians_, coming by degrees to prevail universally,\r\nthey fell under a total neglect. This is the State in which the\r\nPrimitive Christians must be suppos'd to have found them; 'tis not\r\nto be imagin'd they could have made any use of them, at a time when\r\n'twas the daily practice to lay up even the depositions of the Slaves\r\nin them; so that either the Christians made no use of them at all,\r\nor they never were the burying Place of the Slaves. Now as these are\r\nSuppositions that naturally destroy one another, one would count it\r\nmore safe to follow the faint light of a glimmering tradition, than\r\nabandon ones self to the Conduct of an _Ignis fatuus_, that for ought\r\na Man knows is actually misleading him, so I beg leave to call the\r\nTestimony of _Festus Pompeius_, that may rather be apply'd to any other\r\nthing than to the Galleries of the Catacombs, carry'd under ground,\r\nthey say 20 Miles from the City in some places, and no Body knows how\r\nfar in others, and to that vast number of Chambers that go off them.\r\nThus therefore the Christians finding them in a state of neglect laid\r\nup the Bodies of their Dead in them; and perhaps when the Persecution\r\nwas hot, conceal'd themselves and kept little separate Assemblies in\r\ntheir Chambers. At last the Empire turning Christians, they fell again\r\nin the old state of neglect, in which they continu'd till upon the\r\nreading of I have forgot what Author that makes mention of them, they\r\ncame to be look'd into and search'd. What I have writ relates to the\r\nCatacombs of _Rome_, those of _Naples_ are a quite other thing, of\r\nwhich _per_ next. I am,\r\n\r\n  _Sir_,\r\n\r\n                      _Your most humble Servant_,\r\n\r\n  Marseilles, Aug. 22.\r\n          1700.\r\n\r\n                                                               J. Monro.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _An accurate Description of the _Lake of Geneva_, not long since\r\n    made by a Person that had visited it divers times in the\r\n    pleasantest season of the Year; and communicated to the Publisher\r\n    by one of his Parisian Correspondents: English'd as followeth._\r\n\r\n\r\nYou have reason, _Sir_, to demand of me an Account of the _Lake of\r\nGeneva_, which, in my opinion, about this Season of the Year (in\r\n_June_) is one of the most pleasant Places of the World. This is the\r\nThird time I have visited it, and I am, if I may say so, more charmed\r\nwith it than the first.\r\n\r\nI shall say nothing of the _Alpes_, nor of mount _Jura_, which do\r\nenviron it, which by this Lake as by a large Ditch, are separated\r\nfrom one another: For that would not give you a sufficiently fair\r\n_Idea_ of the Country. Be pleased therefore to represent unto your\r\nself a Croissant of Water, one extremity whereof is Eighteen Leagues\r\ndistant from the other, and the Banks of which are gently raised to\r\nsome heights, then to collines, and at length to stupendous Mountains;\r\nwhich yet are not so linked to one another but that they leave betwixt\r\nthem interstices of Fifteen or Twenty Leagues prospects, checkered by\r\nMeadows, Corn-Fields, Orchards, Vines, Forrests of Fir-Trees, Snow\r\nlying on the sides of the Rocks. All these Objects, which at a distance\r\nare confounded, and seem to make but one, have near hand their several\r\nBeauties: So well is the Country intersected by Rivulets, which, after\r\nthey have served to make Iron, Paper, &c.; run into the Lake, carrying\r\nwith them very many Fountains.\r\n\r\nBut leaving these Things, I shall now content my self to entertain your\r\nCuriosity by giving you a candid Relation of what I have there observed\r\nin the space of Four Months.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAlthough I have told you, that this Lake hath the figure of a\r\n_Croissant_, yet that point, where is _Geneva_, is somewhat longer and\r\nmore extended than the other. This Croissant where 'tis largest, which\r\nis from _Morges_ to _Thonon_, is about Five good Leagues over. That\r\nwhich hinders from making an exact estimate of its Largeness in other\r\nplaces, is, that the Winds by driving the Water toward the Banks have\r\nmade certain points, which advance far into the Lake, in such sort\r\nthat when one happens to be opposite to the other, the Lake seems to\r\nbe narrow: As may be observed in going from _Geneva_ to _Nion_, where\r\nit seems as if the _Pharus_ or watch Tower of _Prangin_, which is in\r\n_Suisse_, did almost touch _Savoy_; whereas yet one is a League distant\r\nfrom the other. And, what is remarkable, is, that at the coming out\r\nof this Streight, the Lake hath there almost its greatest breadth and\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\nThe Water of this Lake is very good to drink, and ever so limpid, that\r\neven in the rolling of the Waves, which sometimes go high enough, the\r\nWater is not troubled but along the Banks. And if one do attentively\r\nlook down from the Castle of _Chilon_ or from any of the neighbouring\r\nheights into the bottom of the Lake, he may see high Mountains under\r\nthe Water. And the Water is so Deep before _Veuvay_, that the sounding\r\nLine at the end of four hundred Fathoms seems, because it will not\r\nstay, to Touch upon something slippery. 'Tis held to be 500 Fathoms\r\ndeep before _Roole_; and 'tis affirm'd, that near this great Depth\r\nthere may be seen a kind of _Isle_ under Water.\r\n\r\nThe _Rhone_ enters at one of the Points of the Croissant into the Lake,\r\nand issueth out at the other; but with this Difference, that whereas\r\nhe comes in Dirty and Miry, he ever goes out so Pure and Clear, that\r\nunder the Bridge of _Geneva_, where the Water is deep twenty five Feet\r\nin Summer, you may well discern the smallest Stones at the bottom. And\r\nthe same Water, which in this Place appears of a Saphyring Blew in the\r\nshade of the Houses, appears altogether Green, nor is so Transparent,\r\nwhen the Sun shines on it.\r\n\r\nThere is a great diversity of Opinions as to the _Current_ of the\r\n_Rhone_ in the Lake; some maintaining, that it may be discerned, others\r\ndenying it. Having heard the Sentiments of the Curious of _Lausanne_\r\nand _Geneva_, and the Opinions of the most knowing Fishermen that are\r\nthere in great Number, and especially at _Coupet_, I believe with the\r\nlatter; that, although the _Rhone_ entring into the Lake loseth its\r\nViolence, yet doth he still keep some sensible Motion in some places,\r\nand every were observable, and that no Trouts are taken any were in\r\nthis Lake, but in this Current of the _Rhone_; which is what these\r\nFishermen call, to go and Fish _sur le mont_.\r\n\r\nOthers there are, that go further and say, that one may every where\r\ndistinguish the Water of the Lake from that of the _Rhone_: But the\r\nFishermen will not allow this, but assert, that there is no other Mark\r\nthan those lately alledged, _viz._ of the Trouts, and the Current;\r\nand that the latter of these is alone sufficient, in calm Weather, to\r\nobserve the Current of the _Rhone_ from the place of his entring the\r\nLake unto that of his going out.\r\n\r\nThe Water of this Lake commonly begins to Increase about the end of\r\n_January_, or the beginning of _February_, and continues to do so unto\r\nthe twentieth of _July_, and often unto the very Month of _August_; and\r\nthen it insensibly decreaseth, so that the Water is less high in Winter\r\nthan Summer by twelve or fifteen Feet; the Frosts draining the Springs,\r\nor rather Freezing the Waters that issue out of them.\r\n\r\nAbout this Increase of the Water there are also different Opinions.\r\n'Tis true, they all believe in general, that the principal cause of\r\nthe Increase of the Water is the melting of the Snow, and of the\r\nMountainous Ice, that is in the Winter form'd of the Waters of the\r\nSprings and Torrents, which the Frost fixeth. This is so true, that\r\nwhen there is much Snow in Winter, the Waters are very high the ensuing\r\nSummer. But when great Rains chance to fall in _January_, then the\r\nSnow, not yet being well hardened, melteth on a sudden altogether.\r\nAnd when this melting is not so violent, all the Snow that will melt,\r\nmelts at the end of _May_ or at the beginning of _June_; so that, there\r\nremaining but the stock of Ice for entertaining the Increase of the\r\nWater unto the Month of _August_, some have thence been induced to say,\r\nthat this Increase, which amounts, as has been said, to 15 Feet Water\r\ngenerally all over the Lake, is caused by the Herbs, growing, as they\r\npretend, at its bottom in great abundance; and that these Herbs, whilst\r\ngrowing, do force the Water upwards, and dying in Autumn make the Water\r\nto sink lower. Which is not satisfactory to me, because there are no\r\nHerbs seen upon the Lake, and very little within it, and the Banks\r\nbeing very dry.\r\n\r\nOthers there are, that will have this Water rarified by the Heat of the\r\nSun, and thereupon swell'd on the Borders, hot Water not being so high\r\nin the middle as cold.\r\n\r\nThis is certain, that all the Rivers and Torrents, that fall into this\r\nLake, carry with them store of Stones and Earth, which may indeed\r\nenlarge and raise it: But such an augmentation or rise cannot be\r\nsensible but from Age to Age; not to mention, that in Winter, whilst\r\nthe Water is low, the Stones of the Lakes are carried away for building\r\nor fortifying at _Geneva_.\r\n\r\nAt the issuing out of the Barres, that form _Geneva_, on the side of\r\nthe Lake, are seen in the Water two or three huge Flints, standing out\r\nof the Water; the chief of which they call _Niton_: And the Tradition\r\nis, that it formerly was an Altar consecrated to _Neptune_; there being\r\nalso a place cut out in the middle, which they take to have been the\r\nplace for the Sacrifice. On this Flint seven or eight Persons can sit;\r\nand sometimes, when the Waters are very low, there are found about it\r\nKnives, and Needles as thick as Bodkins of tweeses, and much longer;\r\nboth of Brass, well enough made, and esteemed to have served for the\r\nSacrifices.\r\n\r\nThis Lake in serene and calm Weather appears sometimes, and that even\r\nbefore Sun-rising, as if it were made of divers pieces, differently\r\ncoloured; part of it being Browner than the rest, which seems to be\r\ncaused by a Breath of Wind passing thorough the Water, coming either\r\nfrom the bottom of the Lake, or from above; tho' others think this\r\ngentle agitation to proceed from some Springs that are at the bottom,\r\nmaking the Water shiver above. But that part of the Water, that is not\r\nmoved, appears as even and smooth as a Looking-Glass, or like Water\r\ntraced by a Ship. And as for the Colours, they are, in my Opinion, an\r\neffect of the neighbouring Mountains, the different Images of which,\r\nbeing confounded in the Water, make an appearance of very pale Colours.\r\n\r\nAfter that the _Rhone_ is entred into the Lake, he retakes not his\r\nimpetuous course before a quarter of a Mile's distance from its coming\r\nforth again, that is, above _Geneva_. And the nearer he comes to that\r\nTown, the more his Bed becomes narrow, and consequently his course\r\nmore Rapid. Yet this Rapidness hath been in our times once surmounted\r\nby Wind, and once by Water. To understand which, you may imagine, that\r\nin _Geneva_ there is a streak of Land about an hundred Fathoms long,\r\nwhich divides the _Rhone_ into two parts, passing under four Bridges,\r\nthen covered with Houses. From the Point of this Isle unto several\r\nranks of Stakes on that side of the Town, there are about a Thousand\r\ncommon Paces. This whole space of Water, which makes the figure of an\r\nV (whereof the Isle is the Point, and the Town forms the sides, and\r\nthe Stakes the empty place of the end) hath been once laid dry by a\r\nviolent Wind, after this manner. One Day in the Winter of the Year\r\n1645. there arose in the Morning about 9 a clock so furious a Wind,\r\nthat not only it uncovered the Houses, but also laid dry the Bed of the\r\n_Rhone_ above the Bridges, so that many, in the view of all the Town\r\ncrossed quite over it dry-foot, and one of the Sons of M. _D. Aubigny_\r\ntook up some Medals, which he found in his way. This passage was free\r\nduring an Hours time; at the end of which the River retook its course.\r\nAt that Season the Water being very low, and a West-Wind, to arrive at\r\n_Geneva_, being pressed by the high Mountains that bring it upon the\r\nTown as by the nose of a pair of Bellows; it came to pass, that that\r\nWind did violently bear upon the Water near the said Bars keeping\r\nsuspended the Water that was beyond, and those Waters, that were\r\nbeneath, running away downwards by a declivity, and under the shelter\r\nof the Houses. Whilst I was scrupling at this Relation, they brought\r\nme _Gallasius_ his Commentary upon _Exodus_, Printed 1560. where 'tis\r\nrecorded, that the like accident had fallen out at _Geneva_ at the\r\ntime when that Minister lived there, a South West Wind having made\r\nthe _Rhone_ to recoil into the Lake, and many People having thereupon\r\npassed over dry for an Hours time.\r\n\r\nConcerning the other Accident; you may remember, that the River _Arve_,\r\nwhich is a kind of Torrent falls into the _Rhone_, about a 1000 Paces\r\nbeneath _Geneva_. In the Month of _December_ in the Year 1652. the said\r\n_Arve_ did so extraordinarily swell, that not only it over-run its\r\nBanks with impetuosity, but also interrupted the course of the _Rhone_,\r\nand forc'd it to re-enter into the Lake for the space of fourteen\r\nhours; though some do esteem, that the _Arve_ dis-gorged it self for\r\nthat time into the Lake, by passing _over_ the Water of the _Rhone_,\r\nwhich, in their Opinion, continued his course under the Water of the\r\n_Arve_. However the Water was seen at _Geneva_ to re-enter into the\r\nLake.\r\n\r\nBut to conclude, this Lake doth very much abound in Fish; but that\r\nwhich is observable is, that those Fishes have as 'twere cantonized\r\nthemselves, and divided the Lake among them. The _Trouts_ are not to\r\nbe found there, but, as hath been already mentioned, in the Current of\r\nthe _Rhone_: The _Carps_ have taken up their quarter towards _Veuvay_:\r\nThe _Pikes_ and _Pearches_ have also their Habitations apart. But some\r\nother Fish, that are but Passengers, not living constantly in the Lake,\r\nspread themselves almost every where indifferently.\r\n\r\nThe great Trouts pass out of the Lake for four Months of the Summer,\r\nand are taken in Autumn when they are returning thither. The Fishing\r\nis farmed out at _Geneva_; and there are Conservatories where many of\r\nthose big Trouts are kept, among which there are some that weigh fifty\r\npounds. Sometimes they catch Pikes there of eighty pounds weight; and a\r\npound weight at _Geneva_ you know to be eighteen Ounces.\r\n\r\nIn the Months of _July_ and _August_ they fish there for the Fry of\r\nPearches, at a time when they are no bigger than the smallest Taggs.\r\nThese are a very delicious Dish, there called _Mille Cantons_.\r\n\r\nI shall add no more than put you in mind of that Duke of _Savoy_, who\r\nrenounced his Crown and the Pontificat it self, to pass deliciously the\r\nrest of his Days at _Ripialles_, where he made so good cheer to all\r\nthat visited him, that to express a very merry Entertainment, they say\r\nstill, _faire Ripialles_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Part of a Journal kept from _Scotland_ to _New Caledonia_ in\r\n    _Darien_, with a short Account of that Country. Communicated by\r\n    Dr. _Wallace_, F. R. S._\r\n\r\n\r\n_September 2._ we weighed at _Maderas_, and were under the Tropic of\r\n_Cancer_ by the 10th of the Month, at which time the usual Ceremony\r\nof Ducking from the Yards-arm was performed on those that could not\r\npay their Tropick Bottle. All this time we had a brisk and constant\r\nTrade-wind, which lasted three days more, but afterwards we had it more\r\nvariable than is usual in that place of the Sea.\r\n\r\nThe 28th we made _Deseada_, a small high Island, about a league in\r\nlength and as much in breadth; it is full of Trees, but whether it\r\naffords Water or not I know not. It is uninhabited. Next morning we\r\nwere betwixt _Antego_ and _Montserat_, belonging to the _English_,\r\nboth pretty large and mountainous. _Antego_ is Peopled with _English_\r\nfor the most part, and _Montserat_ by a mixture of _English_ and\r\n_Irish_. Their Product is Sugar and Tobacco. We were in the afternoon\r\nclose by _Redonda_, a small Rock about a mile long, inhabited only by\r\nNoddies and Boobies. When we were some leagues from _Redonda_, we\r\nsaw at the same time _Antego_, _Montserat_, _Redonda_, _Nevis_, _St.\r\nChristophers_, and _Statia_. We sailed close by _Nevis_, it bearing\r\nNorth of us; it is a small well Peopled Island, its Product is Sugar.\r\nThey twisted the Flag at the Harbour, and we shew'd them the Company's\r\nColours. _St. Christophers_ is a large Island, ill Peopled, belongs\r\nhalf to the _English_, half to the _French_. Night parted us from\r\nthese Islands, and next day, which was the 30th, we came in sight of\r\n_Santa Cruz_, belonging to the _Spaniards_. When we were within four\r\nleagues they held a Council. The _Unicorn_ and _Snow_ were sent to St.\r\n_Thomas_, a small Island belonging to the _Danes_; it is a free Port,\r\nand they say is well fortified. We went on to the Southward of the\r\nIsland, and next Day, being _October 1._ we were about 12 a clock past\r\nthe S. W. corner. It is very level towards the South. That Night we got\r\na sight of _Crab Island_, and next Day\r\n\r\n_October 2._ we came into it, and sent some of our People ashore, and\r\ntook possession of it in the Companies name. _October_ the 4th we stood\r\nto the Leeward, hearing there was a Harbour there; when we came we\r\nsaw the _Danes_ Colours flying on the Shore, for the Governour of St.\r\n_Thomas_ had sent 14 Men and a Captain to take possession of it in the\r\nKing of _Denmark_'s name. Our Councellors sent to know his Business\r\nthere, and he told them this, but we found that we had taken possession\r\nof the Place before they came from St. _Thomas_. They gave in their\r\nProtest, yet seem'd to be glad enough of our Neighbourhood. We had\r\nnotwithstanding our Flag upon the Shore all the while we stay'd, with\r\n100 Men, and Captain _Melean_ Governour; they stayed till we were gone,\r\nbut would certainly March next Day, otherwise the _Spaniards_ of _Porto\r\nRico_ would not miss to take them off.\r\n\r\nThe 6th, Captain _Pinkerton_ and the _Snow_ came in from St. _Thomas_,\r\nwith old Captain _Alison_ along with them for a Pilot. On the 8th we\r\nleft this place, and on the 17th made _Nostra Signiora della Popa_,\r\nwe lay aside there along the Coast, until the 3d Day of _November_,\r\ngenerally losing by Night what we had gain'd all Day.\r\n\r\n_Crab Island_ is about 6 Leagues long, and in some places 5 broad,\r\nthe Soil is very good. It's all full of Trees; all the South side is\r\nfull of Bays, very fit for anchoring in, but the best of all is to the\r\nLeeward, where the _Dane_ hoised his Colours. It would have been worth\r\nour while to possess it, had we not been a coming to a better Country.\r\nIt has this Inconvenience, that nothing but strength of Men, or Peace\r\nwith every Body, can render it secure. It is called _Crab Island_, from\r\nthe multitude of Land-Crabs there.\r\n\r\n_November 3._ We anchored before _Golden Island_, and sent in our\r\nPinnace to the Bay. The Natives had hoised a White Flag in sign of\r\nPeace, and told us a great many Stories of Captain _Swan_, Captain\r\n_Davies_, and others, for they took us for _English_, by reason of our\r\nred Fly; but we took no notice of the Men they nam'd. At last they\r\nask'd us our Business? we told them we designed to settle among them,\r\nand to be their Friends. They told us we were very welcome, and that\r\nby prediction they had expected us these two Years; for they say that\r\ntwo Years ago it was foretold them that a People should come and live\r\namong them, that would treat them civilly, and teach them good manners.\r\nWe conversed some time with them, and after viewing the Harbour came\r\naboard.\r\n\r\nThe 4th we came into the great Harbour of _Caledonia_: It is a most\r\nexcellent one, for it is about a League in length from N. W. to S. E.\r\nIt is about half a Mile broad at the Mouth, and in some places a Mile\r\nand more farther in. It is large enough to contain 500 sail of Ships.\r\nThe greatest part of it is Land-lock'd, so that it is safe, and cannot\r\nbe toucht by any Wind that can blow the Harbour, and the Sea makes\r\nthe Land that lies betwixt them a Peninsula. There is a Point of the\r\nPeninsula at the Mouth of the Harbour, that may be fortified against\r\na Navy. This Point secures the Harbour, so that no Ship can enter but\r\nmust be within reach of their Guns. It likewise defends half of the\r\nPeninsula, for no Guns from the other side of the Harbour can touch it,\r\nand no Ship carrying Guns dare enter for the Breast-work at the Point.\r\nThe other side of the Peninsula is either a Precipice, or defended\r\nagainst Ships by Shoals and Breaches, so that there remains only the\r\nnarrow Neck that is not naturally fortify'd; and if 30 Leagues of a\r\nWilderness will not do that, it may be artificially fortified 20 ways.\r\nIn short, it may be made impregnable, and there is Bounds enough within\r\nit, if it were all cultivated, to afford 10000 Hogsheads of Sugar\r\nevery Year. The Soil is rich, the Air good and temperate, the Water is\r\nsweet, and every thing contributes to make it healthful and convenient.\r\nThe Product of this Place, I mean in the Harbour and Creeks hereabouts,\r\nis Turtle, Manatee, and a vast variety of very good small Fish, from\r\nthe bigness of a Salmon to that of a Perch. The Land affords Monkeys of\r\ndifferent sorts, Wild-Deer, _Indian_ Rabbit, Wild Hog, Parrots of many\r\nkinds, Parakites, Macaws, Pelicans, and a hundred more Birds we have\r\ngot no name to. There are moreover Land-Crabs, Souldiers, Land-Turtle,\r\nLizards, Guanha's, Cock-Lizards, and Scorpions: I had almost forgot\r\nPartridges, Pheasants, and a kind of Turkey. All the Birds in this\r\nCountry are beautiful, but none of them that I could observe have any\r\nNotes. We have a Monkey aboard that chirms like a Lark, it will never\r\nbe bigger than a Rat. This Place affords legions of monstrous Plants,\r\nenough to confound all the Methods of Botany ever hitherto thought\r\nupon. However, I found a shift to make some Specimens, and that is all\r\nI can do. I say some Specimens, because if I should gather all, 'twould\r\nbe enough to load the St. _Andrew_, for some of their Leaves exceed\r\nthree Ells in length, and are very broad; besides these Monsters,\r\nreducible to no Tribe, there are here a great many of the _European_\r\nkindred, (but still something odd about them) as _Lingua Cervina_ of\r\ndifferent kinds, _Filix_ of different kinds, _Polypodium_, several\r\nof the _Plantæ Papilonaceæ_, _Musci_, _Fungi_, _Convolvuli_, and a\r\ngreat many more I cannot now remember. Now come we to their People.\r\nThe Men are generally very Civil and Sagacious, have all of them good\r\nFaces, are of low stature, but very well built; they are of a Copper\r\nColour, and have black Hair; they us'd to go naked, but are now as well\r\nCloath'd as our selves; they wear a Plate of Gold in their Nose, and a\r\ngreat many rows of Beads about their Neck and Wrists. They cover their\r\nYard with a piece of Bark, or sometimes Silver, of the very shape and\r\nbigness of that Paper-case we use to put a dose of Pills in; they seem\r\nto be very ill furnish'd, for I never saw any of them have it half an\r\nInch long, yet no doubt it's longer, but I fancy they sheath it up,\r\nas Dogs and Horses do. The Women are generally the most pitiful like\r\nthings that ever Man saw; their Habit differs from the Men, for they\r\nordinarily wear a Ring in their Nose; they have Petticoats and a Veil\r\nover their Face. They are under no formal Government, but every Captain\r\ncommands his own River, Bay or Island, where he lives; the greatest\r\nof them all is one Captain _Ambrosio_, he commands particularly the\r\nCountry about the _Samballoes_ Point, but when he pleases he can Levy\r\nall the Men betwixt that and the Gulf about 20 Leagues. There is\r\nanother Captain _Pedro_, that lives in the House with _Ambrosio_, and\r\nis his Nephew and Son in Law; there is a 3d Captain _Andreas_ that\r\ncommands the River _Das armas_; a 4th Captain _Brandy_, that commands\r\nabout the _Golden Island_; a 5th Captain _Andreas_, that commands the\r\nCountry adjoining to our Settlement; and a 6th Captain _Pedro_ his\r\nConsort; a 7th Captain _Pacigo_, who commands at _Carret Bay_, and\r\nCaptain _Diego_ that commands the Gulph. _Ambrosio_ seems to be the\r\ngreatest, and _Diego_ next, both old Men; they are all very much our\r\nFriends, and fond of us. All have been frequently here except Captain\r\n_Diego_ who is Goutish. Some of these Captains wear the _Scots_ Flag in\r\ntheir Canoa's. There is no such thing as a King or Emperor of _Darien_,\r\nnor, so far as we can gather from all the chief Men hereabout, has\r\nbeen these 40 or 50 Years: The old Men remember such a Man, they say\r\nhe was a Tyrant, would take as many Wives as he pleased, and allow\r\nthem but one, and therefore they cut him off. This derogates much from\r\nthe reputation of the _History of the Buccaneers_. If there were such\r\na Man, he has been an _Indian_ made Emperor by themselves, I mean by\r\nthe _Buccaneers_. This Country certainly affords Gold enough, for\r\nbesides that the Natives constantly assure us, that they know several\r\nGold Mines on this side; besides that, I say, the Plates they wear in\r\ntheir Noses, and the quantity of Gold that is among them, is enough\r\nto perswade any Man of the truth of it. There was one Night aboard\r\nhere some _Indians_ that had a hundred Ounces of Gold about them.\r\nWe are certainly much bound to Providence in this affair; for as we\r\nwere searching for the place we were directed to, we found this, and\r\nthough the Privateers had been so often at _Golden Island_, and though\r\n_English_, _Dutch_ and _French_ had been all over this Coast, from\r\n_Portobelo_ to _Cartegena_, yet never one of them made the discovery;\r\neven the _Spaniards_ themselves never knew of this place. Besides,\r\nfor as great a secret as we thought the Project, it was known all the\r\n_West Indies_ over, and yet it was not in their power to crush it. At\r\n_Madera_ they seem'd to know it, at St. _Thomas_ I'm sure they knew\r\nit; at _Portobelo_ their Intelligence was so good, that they knew the\r\nnames of all our Councellors and Captains of Ships before we landed,\r\nand had that particular observation, that there were four _Roberts_\r\namong them. Our circumstances are in some Respects very good, for we\r\nhave advice by the way of _Portobelo_, that there is a great Rebellion\r\nin _Mexico_, and Captain _Diego_ and all the _Indians_ about him are\r\nat present at War with the _Spaniards_. Captain _Ambrosio_ is going\r\nto his assistance, and that will divert them on that side; but which\r\nis better than all, that we are now in a posture of defence against\r\nall the _Spanish_ force in _America_. I have seen already _Dutch_,\r\n_French_, and _English_ all at the same time in our Harbour, and all\r\nof them wonder what the rest of the World have been thinking on, when\r\nwe came hither to the best Harbour of _America_, in the best place of\r\nit. Captain _Long_ came in eight days after, and I believe we were a\r\ngreat Eye-sore to him, tho' he said nothing. He commanded the _Rupert\r\nPrize_, a small _English_ Man of War, fitted out by the King, upon\r\nwhat design we know not, but he pretends it was to search for a Silver\r\nWreck; he was on this coast a Month before sounding it; and conversing\r\nwith the Natives, he put ashore Men in some places, to take possession\r\nfor the King of _Great Britain_, but none of them within 15 Leagues\r\nof us. Hearing by the Natives that we were here, he came in with his\r\nLong-Boat, as he said to see us, but I believe it was only to know the\r\ncertainty of what he feared was too true. He had told all the _Indian_\r\nCaptains that he came only to try their inclinations, and that there\r\nwas a great Fleet coming with a great many People to settle among them,\r\nand defend them against their enemies, he meant _English_ that were\r\nto come by his direction; but our Fleet coming within a Month after,\r\nthey all lookt upon us to be the People he spoke of; so that whatever\r\nPresents he made them before that time, was as much for our Advantage\r\nas if our selves had given them. He pretends to be a Conjurer, and to\r\nforetel things; but that was the truest Prophecy ever he spoke, though\r\nhe knew not whom he spoke of.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _A DISCOURSE tending to prove at what _Time_ and _Place_, _Julius\r\n    Cesar_ made his first Descent upon _Britain_: Read before the\r\n    _Royal Society_ by _E. Halley_._\r\n\r\n\r\nThough _Chronological_ and _Historical_ Matters, may not seem so\r\nproperly the Subject of these Tracts, yet there having, in one of\r\nthe late Meetings of the _Royal Society_, been some Discourse about\r\nthe Place where _Julius Cesar_ Landed in _Britain_, and it having\r\nbeen required of me to shew the Reason why I concluded it to have\r\nbeen in the _Downs_; in doing thereof, I have had the good Fortune\r\nso far to please those worthy Patrons of Learning I have the Honour\r\nto serve, that they thought fit to command it to be inserted in the\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_, as an instance of the great Use of\r\n_Astronomical Computation_ for fixing and ascertaining the Times of\r\nmemorable Actions, when omitted or not duly delivered by the Historian.\r\n\r\n1. The Authors that mention this Expedition with any Circumstances,\r\nare _Cæsar_ in his _Commentaries_ _lib._ 4, and _Dion Cassius_ in\r\n_lib._ 39; _Livy_'s account being lost, in whose 105_th._ Book might\r\npossibly have been found the Story more at large. It is certain that\r\nthis Expedition of _Cæsars_, was in the Year of the _Consulate_ of\r\n_Pompey_ and _Crassus_, which was in the Year of _Rome_ 699. or the\r\n55_th_ before the usual Æra of Christ: And as to the time of the Year,\r\n_Cæsar_ says that _Exigua parte æstatis reliqua_, he came over only\r\nwith two Legions, _viz._ the 7_th_ and 10_th_ and all Foot, in about 80\r\nSail of Merchant Ships, 18 Sail that were ordered to carry the Horse\r\nnot being able to get out at the same time from another Port, where\r\nthey lay Wind-bound. He says that he arrived about the 4th hour of\r\nthe Day, _viz._ between Nine and Ten in the Morning, on the Coast of\r\n_Britain_, where he found the Enemy drawn up on the _Cliffs_ ready to\r\nrepel him, which place he thus describes. _Loci hæc erat natura, adeo\r\nmontibus augustis mare continebatur ut ex locis superioribus in littus\r\ntelum adjicit possit_, by which the _Cliffs_ of _Dover_ and the _South\r\nForeland_ are justly described, and could be no other Land, being he\r\nsays in the 5_th_ Book of his Commentaries, _in Britanniam trajectum\r\nesse cognoverit circitur millium passum triginta à continenti_, the\r\n_Cliffs_ of the _North-Foreland_ being at a much greater distance.\r\nHere he says he came to an Anchor, and staid till the 9_th_ hour, or\r\ntill about between Three and Four in the Afternoon, expecting till his\r\nwhole Fleet was come up; and in the mean time called a Council of War,\r\nand advertised his Officers, after what manner they were to make their\r\nDescent, particularly in relation to the Stuff of the Sea, whose motion\r\nhe calls _celerem atq. instabilem_, quick and uneven. Then, _viz._\r\nabout Three in the Afternoon he weighed Anchor, and having gotten the\r\n_Wind_ and _Tide_ with him, he Sail'd about Eight Miles from the first\r\nplace, and Anchor'd against an open and plain Shore.\r\n\r\n2. Here he made his Descent, and having told us the opposition that\r\nwas made, and the means he used to get on Shore, he comes to say, that\r\nafter he had been _Four Days_ in _Britain_, the 18 Ships with his Horse\r\nput to Sea, and were come in sight of his Camp, when a suddain Tempest\r\narose, with contrary Wind, so that some of the Ships put back again,\r\nothers were driven to the Westwards, not without great danger, and\r\ncoming to Anchor, they found they could not ride it out: so when Night\r\ncame on, they put off to Sea and returned from whence they came. _That\r\nsame Night_ it was _Full-Moon_, which makes the greatest Tides in the\r\nOcean, and they being ignorant thereof, their Gallies, which were drawn\r\non Shore, were filled by the Tide, _&c._\r\n\r\n3. Then he says that the Day of the Autumnal Equinox being at hand,\r\nafter some Days stay, wherein there passed no Action because he kept\r\nclose in his Camp by the shore; and not thinking it proper to stay till\r\nthe Winter came on, he returned into _Gallia_: The next Year he made a\r\nfurther Expedition with 5 Legions and a good Body of Horse, but there\r\nis but little in the History thereof serving to our purpose, excepting\r\nthat he says he set Sail from the _Portus Icius_ about Sun Set, with a\r\ngentle S. W. Wind, _leni Africo profectus_; that about Midnight it fell\r\nCalm, and being carried away with the Tide, by the time it was Day, he\r\nfound he had left _Britain_ on the left hand; but then the Tide turning\r\nthey fell to their Oars, and by Noon reached that part of the Island\r\nwhere he Landed before, and came on Shore without opposition: and then\r\nMarch'd up into the Country, leaving his Ships at Anchor _in littora\r\nmolli & aperto_.\r\n\r\n4. This is all in _Cæsar_ that is any thing pertinent, and I find no\r\nwhere else any thing to guide us farther, except one passage in _Dion\r\nCassius_, who speaking of the first Landing of _Cæsar_, says οὐ μέντοι\r\nκαὶ ᾗ ἔδει προσέσχεν, that is, as I Translate it. But he Landed not\r\nwhere he intended, for that the _Britains_ hearing of his coming,\r\nhad possest all usual Places of Landing Ἄκραν οὖν τινὰ προέχουσαν\r\nπεριπλεύσας ἑτέρωσε παρεκομίσθη. Κἀνταῦθα τοὺς προσμίξαντάς οἱ ἐς τὰ\r\nτενάγη ἀποβαίνοντι νικήσας, ἔφθη τῆς γῆς κρατήσας, in my English.\r\nWherefore doubling a certain head Land, he made to the Shore on the\r\nother side, where he overcame those that Skirmished with him at the\r\nWaters edg, and so got well on Land. Here I make bold to translate the\r\nWords ἐς τὰ τενάγη, _at the water edge_, which in _H. Stephens_ Edition\r\nis interpreted _in paludibus_, but I have the Authority of _Suidas_,\r\nwho says τέναγος, πελαγία ἰλὺς, or the Sea Mud, and is therefore\r\nproperly the Ouse on the Sea Shore, and by an easie Figure may be put\r\nfor the Shore it self, where such Ouse commonly is found.\r\n\r\n5. From these _data_, That it was in the Year of the _Consulate_ of\r\n_Pompey_, and _Crassus_; That it was _Exigua parte æstatis reliqua_,\r\nand Four Days before a Full-Moon, which fell out in the Night time.\r\nThe time of this Invasion will be determined to a Day: For by the\r\nEclipse of the Moon, whereof _Drusus_ made so good use to quiet\r\na Mutiny in the _Pannonian_ Army, upon the News of the Death of\r\n_Augustus_, it follows that _Augustus_ Died _Anno Christi_ 14. which\r\nwas reckoned _Anno Vrbis conditæ_ 767. and that this Action was 68\r\nYears before, _viz._ in the 55_th_ Year before Christ Current. In which\r\nYear the Full Moon fell out _August 30._ after Midnight, or 31 in the\r\nMorning before Day; and the preceeding Full-Moon, was _August 1._ soon\r\nafter Noon; so that this could not be the Full-Moon mentioned, as\r\nfalling in the Day time: nor that in the beginning of _July_, it being\r\nnot 10 Days after the Summer solstice, when it would not have been said\r\n_exigua parte æstatis reliqua_. It follows therefore that the Full-Moon\r\nspoken of, was on _August 30._ at Night, and that the Landing on\r\n_Britain_ was _August 26._ in the Afternoon, about a Month before the\r\nAutumnal equinox; which agrees to all the Circumstances of the Story in\r\npoint of Time.\r\n\r\n6. As to the Place, the high Land and Cliffs described, could be no\r\nother than those of _Dover_, and are allowed to have been so by all, it\r\nremains only to examine whether the Descent was made to the Northward\r\nor Southward of the place where he first Anchored. The _data_ to\r\ndetermine this are first that it was Four Days before the Full-Moon.\r\n2. That that Day by Three of the Clock in the Afternoon the Tide ran\r\nthe same way he Sail'd. 3_dly._ That a S. by E. Moon makes High-Water\r\non all that Coast, the Flood coming from the Southward: hence it will\r\nfollow, that that Day it was High-Water there about Eight in the\r\nMorning, and consequently Low-Water about Two, wherefore by Three the\r\nTide of Flood was well made up, and it is plain that _Cæsar_ went with\r\nit, and the Flood setting to the Northward shews that the open plain\r\nShore where he Landed was to the Northward of the Cliffs, and must be\r\nin the _Downs_; and this I take to be little less than Demonstration.\r\nA second Argument is drawn from the Wind wherewith he set out on his\r\nsecond Expedition, _viz._ S. W. as appears by the Words _leni Africo\r\nprofectus_, with which the Navigation of those times would hardly\r\npermit a Ship to Sail nearer the Wind than Eight Points, or a N. W.\r\nCourse; which would serve indeed to go into the _Downs_, but would by\r\nno means fetch the Low-land towards _Dengyness_, which is much about\r\nWest from _Calais_, and not more than W. N. W. from _Boulogne_, if it\r\nshall be said that that was the _Portus Icius_ from which _Cæsar_ set\r\nout. Whence I take it to be evident that if _Cæsar_ was not bound more\r\nNortherly than the _South-Foreland_, he could not have thought the\r\n_Africus_ or S. W. Wind proper for his passage, which was then intended\r\nfor the place where he first Landed the year before.\r\n\r\n7. Justly to determine which the _Portus Icius_ was I find no\r\nwhere sufficient grounds; only _Ptolemy_ calls the Promontory of\r\n_Calais-Cliffs_ by the name of Ἴκιον ἄκρον, whence there is reason to\r\nconjecture, that the _Portus Icius_ was very near thereto, and that\r\nit was either _Ambletuse_ on one side, or _Calais_ on the other. The\r\nsame _Ptolemy_ places Γισοῤῥίακον ἐπίνειον in the same Latitude with\r\nthe ἴκιον ἄκρον, but something more to the East, which seems to refute\r\nthose that have supposed the Ancient Port of _Gessoriacum_ to have\r\nbeen _Boulogne_, whereas by _Ptolemy_'s position, it must be either\r\n_Dunkirk_ or _Graveling_, but the former most likely, both by the\r\ndistance from the Ἴκιον ἄκρον, being about 20 Miles or half a degree\r\nof Longitude to the East, or ⅔ of the whole Coast of _Flanders_,\r\nwhich he makes but a degree and quarter from the _Acron Icion_ to the\r\nmouth of the _Scheld_ which he calls _Ostia Tabudæ_: As also for that\r\n_Pliny_ l. 4. c. 16. speaking of _Gessoriacum_, says the _Proximus\r\nTrajectus_ into _Britain_ from thence is 50 Miles, which is too much\r\nunless _Gessoriacum_ were something more Easterly than _Calais_. _Dion\r\nCassius_ makes the distance between _France_ and _Britain_ 450 _stadia_\r\nor 56 Miles, and says likewise 'tis the nearest, τὸ Συντομώτατον. But\r\nthis is in part amended by the explication given in the _Itinerary_\r\nof _Antoninus_, where the space between _Gessacorum_ and _Rutupium_\r\nis said to be 450 _stadia_ (for this was the ordinary passage of\r\nthe _Romans_ into _Britain_,) _Rutupium_ being more Northerly and\r\n_Gessoriacum_ more Easterly than the _termini_ of _Cæsars_ Voyage,\r\nand consequently the distance greater than 30 Miles which _Cæsar_ had\r\nobserv'd; and now lately an accurate Survey has proved the distance\r\nbetween Land and Land to be 26 _English Miles_ or 28½ _Roman Miles_,\r\nwhich shews how near _Cæsars_ estimate was to the Truth.\r\n\r\nA farther Argument (but not of equal force with the former because\r\nof the modernness of the Author, who writ above 250 Years after)\r\nmay be drawn from the words of _Dion Cassius_, where he says ἄκραν\r\nτινὰ προέχουσαν περιπλεύσας ἑτέρωσε παρεκομίσθη, that after his\r\nfirst Anchoring he Sail'd about a Promontory to the place where he\r\nLanded: Now there are no other Promontories on all that Coast but the\r\n_South-Foreland_ and _Dengyness_; the latter of which it could not be,\r\nbecause _Cæsar_ says he Sail'd but 8 Miles, and the _Ness_ it self is\r\nabout 10 Miles from the South and nearest end of the _Chalk-Cliffs_\r\nby the Town of _Hith_; and to have gone round that Point to the\r\nother side, the distance must have been much greater. So that the\r\nPromontory spoken of by _Dion_, must needs be the _South-Foreland_,\r\nand _Cæsar_ must Anchor near over against _Dover_, from whence Sailing\r\n8 Miles, he would double a Head-land and come to the _Downs_; which\r\nis such a Coast as he describes in one place by _apertum ac planum\r\nlittus_, and in his 5_th_ Book by _molle ac apertum littus_. As to\r\n_Dions_ word εἰς τὰ τενάγη, what I have already said about it seems\r\nsufficient to prove that he means no more than the Waters edg; and the\r\n_Etymologists_ derive it from τέγγω _madefacio_, because the wash and\r\nbreach of the Sea does always keep it wet. And this word τὰ τενάγη is\r\nused by _Polybius_ for the Sea Ouse; and in another place he speaks of\r\nthe difficulty of Landing at the mouth of a River, Διὰ τὴν τεναγώδη\r\nπάροδον, _ob limosum accessum_, so that it is not to be doubted that it\r\nought to be rendred in this place, _ad vadum maris_ rather than _in\r\npaludibus_. And so this objection against the assertion that _Cæsar_\r\nLanded in the _Downs_, which is known to be a firm Champain Country\r\nwithout Fenns and Morasses, will be removed; and the whole Argument\r\nwill 'tis hoped be admitted by the Curious.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                _FINIS._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Books Printed for, and Sold by _Jeffery Wale_, at the _Angel_, in\r\n    St. _Paul's Church-Yard_._\r\n\r\n\r\nMiscellany Poems, as Saytyrs, Epistles, Love Verses, Songs, Sonnets,\r\n_&c._ by _William Wycherley_, Esq.; Fol.\r\n\r\nA Supplement to Dr. _Hammond_'s Paraphrase and Annotations of the New\r\nTestament, by Mr. _L'Clerk_.
