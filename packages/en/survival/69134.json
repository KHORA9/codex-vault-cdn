But the question frequently is asked concerning it, How and\r\nunder what conditions was it formed? In order to answer this inquiry it\r\nis necessary to have recourse to the science of geology.\r\n\r\nA brief review of the geological history of the earth’s crust will be\r\nof prime importance, and it will not be inappropriate to go back to the\r\norigin of the earth itself. But no man can begin at the beginning; that\r\nis too far back in the eternal mists; only the Infinite Mind can reach\r\nto it. There is a point, however, to which speculation can journey,\r\nand from which it has brought back brilliant theories to account for\r\nthe existence of the planet on which we live. The most philosophic of\r\nthese theories, as it certainly is the most popular, is the one known\r\nas the Nebular Hypothesis, propounded by Laplace, the great French\r\nastronomer, in 1796. This theory accords so well with the laws of\r\nphysics, and with the human knowledge of the age, that most of the\r\ngreat astronomers have adopted it as the best that has been given to\r\nus, and the world of science may be said to have accepted it as final.\r\nLet us suppose, then, in accordance with this theory, that our earth\r\nwas, at one time, a ball of liquid fire, revolving on its axis, and\r\nmoving, in its orbit, around the parent sun with the motion imparted to\r\nit in the beginning. As cooling and condensation went on, a crust was\r\nformed on its surface, and water was formed on the crust. The waters,\r\nhowever, were no sooner spread out than they were tossed by the motion\r\nof the atmosphere into waves, and these waves, by constant friction\r\nagainst the rock crust of the earth, wore it down into pebbles, sand,\r\nand mud. The silt thus made being washed up on to the primitive rock\r\nand left there by the receding waters became again as hard and firm\r\nas before. Occasionally a subsidence, due to the contraction of the\r\nearth’s body, would take place and the sea would again sweep over the\r\nentire surface, depositing another layer of silt on the one already\r\nformed, or possibly washing that again into sand and pebbles. This\r\nprocess continued through an indefinite period of time, forming layer\r\nupon layer of stratified rock, or excavating great hollows in the\r\nsurface already formed.\r\n\r\nThat period in the history of the earth’s crust before stratification\r\nbegan is known as Archean time. This was followed by the period known\r\nas Paleozoic time, which is divided into three ages. The first is\r\nthe age of Invertebrates. It was during this age that life made its\r\nadvent on the earth. The waters were the first to bring it forth, but\r\nbefore the close of the age it began also to appear on the land, in\r\nisolated spots, in the simplest forms of vegetation. The next age is\r\nknown as the age of Fishes, during which vegetable life became more\r\nvaried and abundant, winged insects floated in the air, and great\r\nsharks and gars swam in the seas. Then came the Carboniferous age or\r\nage of Coal Plants, in which vast areas of what are now the Middle,\r\nSouthern, and Western States were covered with low marshes and shallow\r\nseas, and were rich and rank with multitudinous forms of vegetation.\r\nBut these marshes were again and again submerged and covered with\r\nmaterial washed up by the waves before the final subsidence of the\r\nwaters left them as a continuing portion of the dry land. It was at the\r\nclose of the Carboniferous age that great disturbances took place in\r\nthe earth’s crust. Before this the rock strata had been comparatively\r\nlevel; now they were folded, flexed, broken, rounded into hills, pushed\r\nresistlessly up into mountain ranges. It was at this time that the\r\nupheaval of the great Appalachian Range in North America took place.\r\nFollowing this came Mesozoic time, which had but one age, the age of\r\nReptiles. It was during this age that the type of reptiles reached\r\nits culmination. The land generally brought forth vegetation, though\r\nnot with the prolific richness and luxury of the Carboniferous age.\r\nBirds, insects, and creeping things were abundant, and monsters of the\r\nsaurian tribe swam in the seas, roamed through the marshes, crawled\r\non the sandy shores, and took short flights through the air. The last\r\ngreat division is known as Cenozoic time, and covers two ages, the age\r\nof Mammals and the age of Man. It was during the mammalian age that\r\ntrees of modern types, such as oak, maple, beech, etc., first made\r\ntheir appearance, and mammalian animals of great variety and size, both\r\nherbivorous and carnivorous, roamed through the forests. True birds\r\nflew in the air, true snakes crawled upon the ground, and in the waters\r\nwere whales and many kinds of fishes of the present day. But the marine\r\nmonsters and the gigantic and ferocious saurians of an earlier age had\r\ndisappeared. So the world became fitted to be the dwelling-place of the\r\nhuman race. Then began the age of Man, an age which is yet not complete.\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief, is the history of the earth as the rocks have told\r\nit to us. Without their help we could know but little of the story.\r\nThrough all the periods of time and all the ages, they were being\r\nformed, layer upon layer, of sand and silt, of mud and pebbles,\r\nhardening with the passing of the centuries. But while they were\r\nstill soft they received impressions of the feet of birds and of\r\nbeasts, they were marked by the waves and were cracked in the fierce\r\nheat of the sun, and their surfaces were pitted by the rain-drops of\r\npassing showers. Shells, corals, and sponges were imbedded in them;\r\nthe skeletons of fishes and the bones of animals that walked or crept\r\nupon the land or flew in the air were covered over by them; they caught\r\nand held the drooping fern, the falling leaf and twig and nut; they\r\nclosed around the body of the tree itself and buried it from sight;\r\nand as the soil hardened into rock, bone and shell, leaf and stem,\r\nhardened with it and became part of it. To-day we find these fossil\r\nremains, sometimes near the surface of the earth, sometimes hundreds\r\nor thousands of feet below it. We uncover them from the soil, we break\r\nthem from the rock, we blast them out in the quarries, we dig them\r\nfrom the mines of coal and ore. It is by them and by the structure of\r\nthe rock which contains them that we read the history of the earth, a\r\nhistory covering so long a period of time from the beginning of the\r\nstratification of the rocks to the age when man appeared upon the globe\r\nthat no one has yet dared to reckon the millions upon millions of years\r\nwhich intervened, and give the result of his computation to the world\r\nas true.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COLUMNAR SECTION OF THE EARTH’S CRUST.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE COMPOSITION OF COAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first question that would naturally be asked concerning the subject\r\nwith which we are dealing is, What is coal?\r\n\r\nIn reply it may be said that it is a mineral. It is black or brown\r\nin color, solid, heavy, and amorphous. The specific gravity of the\r\naverage Pennsylvania anthracite is about 1.6, and of the bituminous\r\ncoal about 1.4. There are four varieties of mineral coal, namely:\r\nanthracite, bituminous, lignite or brown coal, and cannel coal. To\r\nthis list it would not be improper to add peat, since it partakes\r\nof most of the characteristics of mineral coal, and would doubtless\r\ndevelop into such coal if the process of transformation were allowed to\r\ncontinue undisturbed. The principal element contained in each of these\r\ndifferent kinds of coal is carbon. An analysis of an average piece of\r\nPennsylvania anthracite would show the following chemical composition:――\r\n\r\n    Fixed carbon        86.4\r\n    Ash                  6.2\r\n    Water                3.7\r\n    Volatile matter      3.1\r\n    Sulphur               .6\r\n                       ―――――\r\n    Total              100\r\n\r\nThe composition of the bituminous coals of Pennsylvania, as represented\r\nby the gas coal of Westmoreland County, is shown by analysis to be as\r\nfollows:――\r\n\r\n    Fixed carbon         55.\r\n    Volatile matter      37.5\r\n    Ash                   5.4\r\n    Water                 1.4\r\n    Sulphur                .7\r\n                        ―――――\r\n    Total               100\r\n\r\nAn analysis of coal from the Pittsburgh region would show its percentage\r\nof carbon to be from 58 to 64, and of volatile matter and ash to be\r\nproportionately less.\r\n\r\nThere is no strict line of demarcation between the anthracite and the\r\nbituminous coals. They are classed generally, according to the amount\r\nof carbon and volatile matter contained in them, as:――\r\n\r\n    Hard-dry Anthracites,\r\n    Semi-Anthracite,\r\n    Semi-Bituminous,\r\n    Bituminous.\r\n\r\nCoals of the first class contain from 91 to 98 per cent, of carbon, and\r\nof the second class from 85 to 90 per cent. The volatile matter in the\r\nthird class is usually less than 18 per cent., and in the fourth class\r\nmore than 18 per cent. of its composition.\r\n\r\nThe anthracite coal is hard and brittle, and has a rich black color\r\nand a metallic lustre. It ignites with difficulty, and at first burns\r\nwith a small blue flame of carbonic oxide. This disappears, however,\r\nwhen ignition is complete. No smoke is given off during combustion.\r\nSemi-anthracite coal is neither so hard, so dense, nor so brilliant in\r\nlustre as the anthracite, though when once fully ignited it has all\r\nthe characteristic features of the latter in combustion. It is found\r\nprincipally at the western ends of the anthracite coal basins.\r\n\r\nBituminous coal is usually deep black in color, with little or no\r\nlustre, having planes of cleavage which run nearly at right angles with\r\neach other, so that when the coal is broken it separates into cubical\r\nfragments. It ignites easily and burns with a yellowish flame. It gives\r\noff smoke and leaves a large percentage of ashes after combustion. That\r\nvariety of it known as caking or coking coal is the most important.\r\nThis is quite soft, and will not bear much handling. During combustion\r\nit swells, fuses, and finally runs together in large porous masses.\r\n\r\nFollowing the question of the composition of coal comes the question\r\nof its origin, of which, indeed, there is no longer any serious doubt.\r\nIt is generally conceded that coal is a vegetable product, and there\r\nare excellent reasons for this belief. The fragments of which coal is\r\ncomposed have been greatly deformed by compression and decomposition.\r\nBut when one of those fragments is made so thin that it will transmit\r\nlight, and is then subjected to a powerful microscope, its vegetable\r\nstructure may readily be distinguished; that is, the fragments are seen\r\nto be the fragments of plants. Immediately under every separate seam of\r\ncoal there is a stratum of what is known as fire clay. It may, under\r\nthe beds of softer coals, be of the consistency of clay; but under the\r\ncoal seams of the harder varieties it is usually in the form of a slaty\r\nrock. This fire clay stratum is always present, and contains in great\r\nabundance the fossil impressions of roots and stems and twigs, showing\r\nthat it was once the soil from which vegetation grew luxuriantly. It\r\nis common also to find fossil tree-stems lying mashed flat between the\r\nlayers of black slate which form the roof of the coal mines, also the\r\nimpressions of the leaves, nuts, and seeds which fell from these trees\r\nwhile they were living. In some beds of cannel coal whole trees have\r\nbeen found, with roots, branches, leaves, and seeds complete, and all\r\nconverted into the same quality of coal by which they were surrounded.\r\nIn short, the strata of the coal measures everywhere are full of the\r\nfossil impressions of plants, of great variety both in kind and size.\r\n\r\nIf a piece of wood be subjected to heat and great pressure, a substance\r\nis obtained which strongly resembles mineral coal.\r\n\r\nThat coal contains a very large proportion of carbon in its composition\r\nhas already been noted. If, therefore, it is a vegetable product, the\r\nvegetation from which it was formed must have been subjected to some\r\nprocess by which a large part of its substance was eliminated, since\r\nwood or woody fibre contains only from 20 to 25 per cent. of carbon.\r\nBut wood can be transformed, by combustion, into charcoal, a material\r\ncontaining in its composition 98 per cent, of carbon, or a greater\r\npercentage than the best anthracite contains. This cannot be done,\r\nhowever, by burning wood in an open fire, for in that case its carbon\r\nunites with atmospheric oxygen and passes invisibly into the air. It\r\nmust be subjected to a process of smothered combustion; free access\r\nof air must be denied to it while it is burning. Then the volatile\r\nmatter will be freed and expelled, and, since the carbon cannot come\r\nin contact with the oxygen of the air, it will be retained, together\r\nwith a small percentage of ash. The result will be charcoal, or coal\r\nartificially made. The principle on which this transformation is based\r\nis combustion or decomposition out of contact with atmospheric air.\r\nBut Nature is as familiar with this principle as is man, and she may\r\nnot only be discovered putting it in practice, but the entire process\r\nmay be watched from beginning to end. One must go, for this purpose,\r\nfirst, to a peat bed. This is simply an accumulation of the remains of\r\nplants which grew and decayed on the spot where they are now found. As\r\nthese remains were deposited each year, every layer became buried under\r\nits succeeding layer, until finally a great thickness was obtained.\r\nWhen we remove the upper layer we find peat with its 52 to 66 per\r\ncent. of carbon, and the deeper we go the better is the quality of the\r\nsubstance. It may be cut out in blocks with sharp spades, the water may\r\nbe pressed from the blocks, and they may be stacked up, covered and\r\ndried, and used for fuel. In most peat bogs the process of growth is\r\ngoing on, and may be watched. There is a certain kind of moss called\r\n_sphagnum_, which in large part makes up the peat-producing vegetation.\r\nIts roots die annually, but from the living top new roots are sent out\r\neach year. The workmen who dig peat understand that if this surface\r\nis destroyed the growth of the bed must stop; consequently in many\r\ninstances they have removed the sod carefully, and after taking out\r\na stratum of peat have replaced the sod in order that the bed may be\r\nrenewed. There is little doubt that if these beds of peat could lie\r\nundisturbed and covered over through many ages they would take on all\r\nthe characteristics of mineral coal.\r\n\r\nA step farther back in geological history we reach the period of the\r\nlatest formations of lignite or brown coal. This coal is first found in\r\nthe strata of the glacial period, or first period in the age of Man.\r\nBut it is found there in an undeveloped state. The woody fibre has not\r\nyet undergone the complete transformation into coal. The trunks and\r\nbranches of trees have indeed become softened to the consistence of\r\nsoap, but they still retain their natural color. Going back, however,\r\nto the strata of the Miocene or second period of the Tertiary age or\r\nage of Mammals, we find that this wood has become black, though it\r\nhas not yet hardened. But when we reach the upper cretaceous or last\r\nperiod of the age of Reptiles, the transformation into coal has become\r\ncomplete. The woody fibre is now black, hard, and compact, though it\r\nmay still be easily disaggregated by atmospheric action, and we have\r\nthe true lignite, so called because of its apparent woody structure.\r\n\r\nThe next step takes us back to the bituminous coal of the Carboniferous\r\nage, the character and consistency of which has already been noted,\r\nand finally we reach the complete development in anthracite. It is,\r\nhowever, the opinion of the best geologists that the bituminous and\r\nanthracite coals are of the same age, and were originally of the same\r\nformation and character. That is, they were all bituminous; but during\r\nthe violent contortions and upheavals of the earth’s crust at the time\r\nof the Appalachian revolution at the close of the Carboniferous age,\r\nthe bituminous coals involved in that disturbance were changed by heat,\r\npressure, and motion, and the consequent expulsion of volatile matter,\r\nfrom bituminous to anthracite.\r\n\r\nCannel coal is a variety of bituminous coal, burning with great\r\nfreedom, the flame of which affords considerable light. It was called\r\n“candle coal” by the English people who first used it, as it often\r\nserved as a substitute for that household necessity. But the name soon\r\nbecame corrupted to “cannel,” and has so remained. It is duller and\r\nmore compact than the ordinary bituminous coal, and it can be wrought\r\nin a lathe and polished. A certain variety of it, found in the lower\r\noölitic strata of Yorkshire in England, is manufactured into a kind of\r\njewelry, well known by its popular name of _jet_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nWHEN COAL WAS FORMED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt becomes of interest now to examine briefly into the causes and\r\nprocess of the transformation from vegetable substance into coal, to\r\nnote the character of the vegetation which went to make up the coal\r\nbeds, and to glance at the animal life of the period.\r\n\r\nAs has already been said, the plants of the Carboniferous age were\r\nexceedingly abundant and luxuriant. They grew up richly from the clayey\r\nsoil, and formed dense jungles in the vast marshes which covered so\r\nlarge an area of the earth’s surface. Ferns, mosses, and tufts of\r\nsurface vegetation, and the leaves, branches, and trunks of trees fell\r\nand decayed on the place where they grew, only to make the soil more\r\nfertile and the next growth richer and more luxuriant. Year after\r\nyear, century after century, this process of growth and decay went on,\r\nuntil the beds of vegetable matter thus deposited had reached a great\r\nthickness. But condensation was still in progress in the earth’s body,\r\nand in consequence of it her crust, of necessity, at times contracted\r\nand fell. When it did so the land sank throughout vast areas, these\r\nbeds of incipient coal went down, and over the great marshes the waters\r\nswept again, bringing drift of vegetation from higher levels to add\r\nto that already buried. Then over these deposits of vegetable matter\r\nthe sand and mud and gravel were laid up anew, and the clayey soil\r\nfrom which the next rich growth should spring was spread out upon the\r\nsurface. This process was repeated again and again, as often, indeed,\r\nas we find seams of coal in any coal bed. Thus the final condition for\r\nthe formation of coal was met, the exclusion of atmospheric air from\r\nthis mass of decaying vegetation was complete, and under the water\r\nof the ocean, under the sand and silt of the shore, under the new\r\ndeposits of succeeding ages, the transformation went on, the wood of\r\nthe Carboniferous era became the coal of to-day, while above and below\r\nit the sand and clay were hardened into rock and shale.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable features of the vegetation of the coal era were the\r\nsize and abundance of its plants. Trees of that time whose trunks\r\nwere from one to three feet in diameter, and which grew to a height\r\nof from forty to one hundred feet, are represented in our day by mere\r\nstems a fraction of an inch in diameter and but one or two feet high.\r\nA comparison of quantity would show differences as great as does the\r\ncomparison of size.\r\n\r\nBut at that time all the conditions were favorable for the rapid and\r\nenormous growth of vegetation. The air was laden with carbon, which\r\nis the principal food for plants; so laden, indeed, that man, who is\r\neminently an oxygen-breathing animal, could not have lived in it. The\r\ngreat humidity of the atmosphere was another element favorable to\r\ngrowth. Vegetation never lacked for an abundance of moisture either at\r\nroot or leaf. Then, too, the climate was universally warm. Over the\r\nentire surface of the earth the heat was greater than it is to-day at\r\nthe torrid zone. It must be remembered that the internal fires of the\r\nglobe have been constantly cooling and receding, and that the earth, in\r\nthe Carboniferous age, was subjected to the greater power of a larger\r\nsun than shines upon us to-day.\r\n\r\nWith all these circumstances in its favor, warmth, moisture, and an\r\natmosphere charged heavily with carbon, vegetation could not help but\r\nflourish. That it did flourish amazingly is abundantly shown by its\r\nfossil remains. The impressions of more than five hundred different\r\nspecies of plants that grew in the Carboniferous era have been found\r\nin the coal measures. There are few of them that bear any direct\r\nanalogy to existing species, and these few have their counterparts\r\nonly in the torrid zone. The most abundant of the plants of the coal\r\nera were the ferns. Their fossil remains are found in great profusion\r\nand variety in most of the rocks of the coal-bearing strata. There was\r\nalso the plant known as the tree fern, which attained a height of\r\ntwenty or thirty feet and carried a single tuft of leaves radiating\r\nfrom its top. Probably the species next in abundance, as it certainly\r\nis next in importance, to the ferns is that of the Lepidodendrids. It\r\ndoubtless contributed the greatest proportion of woody material to the\r\ncomposition of coal. The plants of this species were forest trees,\r\nbut are supposed to have been analogous to the low club mosses of the\r\npresent. Fossil trunks of Lepidodendrids have been found measuring from\r\none hundred to one hundred and thirty feet in length, and from six to\r\nten feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nSimilar in appearance to the Lepidodendrids were the Sigillariæ, which\r\nwere also very abundant. The Conifers were of quite a different species\r\nfrom those already named, and probably grew on higher ground. They were\r\nsomewhat analogous to the modern pine.\r\n\r\nThe Calamites belonged to the horsetail family. They grew up with long,\r\nreed-like, articulated stems to a height of twenty feet or more, and\r\nwith a diameter of ten or twelve inches. They stood close together in\r\nthe muddy ground, forming an almost impenetrable thicket, and probably\r\nmade up a very large percentage of the vegetation which was transformed\r\ninto coal.\r\n\r\nOne of the most abundant species of plants of the coal era is that of\r\nStigmaria. Stout stems, from two to four inches in diameter, branched\r\ndownward from a short trunk, and then grew out in long root-like\r\nprocesses, floating in the water or trailing on the mud to distances of\r\ntwenty or thirty feet. These are the roots with which the under clay of\r\nevery coal seam is usually filled.\r\n\r\nThe plants which have been described, together with their kindred\r\nspecies, formed the largest and most important part of the vegetation\r\nof the Carboniferous age. But of the hundreds of varieties which then\r\nabounded, the greater portion reached their highest stage of perfection\r\nin the coal era, and became extinct before the close of Paleozoic\r\ntime. Other types were lost during Mesozoic time, and to-day there is\r\nscarcely a counterpart in existence of any of the multitude of forms of\r\nplant life that grew and flourished in that far-off age of the world.\r\n\r\nThe animal life of the Carboniferous era was confined almost entirely\r\nto the water. The dry land had not yet begun to produce in abundance\r\nthe higher forms of living things. There were spiders there, however,\r\nand scorpions, and centipedes, and even cockroaches. There were also\r\nland snails, beetles, locusts, and mayflies. Reptiles, with clumsy\r\nfeet and dragging tails, prowled about on the wet sands of the shore,\r\nleaving footprints that were never effaced by time or the elements, and\r\nare found to-day in the layers of the rocks, almost as perfect as when\r\nthey were formed, millions of years ago. But the waters teemed with\r\nanimal life. On the bottom of the shallow seas lay shells and corals\r\nin such abundance and variety that from the deposits of their remains\r\ngreat beds of limestone have been formed. Broken into minute fragments\r\nby the action of the waves and washed up by the sea during periods of\r\nsubmergence, they were spread over the beds of carboniferous deposits,\r\nand became the rock strata through which the drills and shafts of\r\nto-day are sunk to reach the veins of mineral coal.\r\n\r\nFishes were numerous. Some of them, belonging to species allied to the\r\nmodern shark, were of great size, with huge fin spines fully eighteen\r\ninches in length. These spines have been found as fossils, as have also\r\nthe scales, teeth, and bones. Complete skeletons of smaller fishes of\r\nthe ganoid order were preserved in the rock as it hardened, and now\r\nform fossil specimens which are unequaled in beauty and perfection.\r\n\r\nBesides the fishes, there were the swimming reptiles; amphibian\r\nmonsters, allied to the ichthyosaurs and plesiosaurs which were so\r\nabundant during the Reptilian age that followed. These animals are\r\nknown as enaliosaurs. They attained great size, being from twenty-five\r\nto fifty feet in length; they had air-breathing apparatus, and\r\npropelled themselves through the water with paddles like the paddles\r\nof whales. Their enormous jaws were lined with rows of sharp, pointed\r\nteeth, and their food was fish, shell-fish, and any other kind of\r\nanimal life that came within their reach. They devoured even their own\r\nspecies. Living mostly in the open seas or fresh-water lagoons, they\r\nsometimes chased their prey far up the rivers, and sometimes basked in\r\nthe sunshine on the sands of the shore. Frightful in aspect, fierce,\r\nand voracious, they were the terror and the tyrants of the seas.\r\n\r\nSuch were the animals, such were the plants, that lived and died, that\r\nflourished and decayed, in the age when coal was being formed and\r\nfashioned and hidden away in the crust of the earth. That the fauna and\r\nflora of to-day have few prototypes among them should be little cause\r\nfor regret. There was, indeed, hardly a feature in the landscape of the\r\ncoal era that would have had a familiar look to an inhabitant of the\r\nworld in its present age. In place of the hills and valleys as we have\r\nthem now, there were great plains sloping imperceptibly to the borders\r\nof the sea. There were vast marshes, shallow fresh-water lakes, and\r\nbroad and sluggish rivers. Save by isolated peaks the Rocky Mountains\r\nhad not yet been uplifted from the face of the deep, and the great West\r\nof to-day was a waste of waters. In the wide forests no bird’s song was\r\never heard, no flashing of a wing was ever seen, no serpent trailed\r\nits length upon the ground, no wild beast searched the woods for prey.\r\nThe spider spun his web in silence from the dew-wet twigs, the locust\r\nhopped drowsily from leaf to leaf, the mayfly floated lightly in the\r\nheavy air, the slow-paced snail left his damp track on the surfaces of\r\nthe rocks, and the beetles, lifting the hard coverings from their gauzy\r\nwings, flew aimlessly from place to place. In seas and lakes and swampy\r\npools strange fishes swam, up from the salt waters odd reptiles crawled\r\nto sun themselves upon the sandy shore or make their way through\r\nthe dense jungles of the swamps, and out where the ocean waves were\r\ndashing, fierce monsters of the sea darted on their prey, or churned\r\nthe water into foam in savage fights with each other.\r\n\r\nBut in all the world there were no flowers. Stems grew to be trunks,\r\nbranches were sent out, leaves formed and fell, the land was robed and\r\nwrapped in the richest, most luxuriant foliage, yet the few buds that\r\ntried to blossom were scentless and hidden, and earth was still void of\r\nthe beauty and the fragrance of the flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nHOW THE COAL BEDS LIE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe process of growth, deposition, submergence, and burial, described\r\nin the preceding chapter, continued throughout the Carboniferous age.\r\nEach period of inundation and of the covering over of beds of vegetable\r\ndeposit by sand and silt is marked by the layers of stratified rock\r\nthat intervene between, and that overlie the separate seams of coal in\r\nthe coal measures of to-day. The number of these coal seams indicates\r\nthe number of periods during which the growth and decay of vegetation\r\nwas uninterrupted. This number, in the anthracite coal regions, varies\r\nfrom ten to thirty or thereabouts, but in the bituminous regions it\r\nscarcely ever exceeds eight or ten. The thickness of the separate\r\ncoal seams also varies greatly, ranging from a fraction of an inch up\r\nto sixty or seventy feet. Indeed, there are basins of small extent\r\nin the south of France and in India where the seam is two hundred\r\nfeet thick. It is seldom, however, that workable seams of anthracite\r\nexceed twenty feet in thickness, and by far the largest number of\r\nthem do not go above eight or ten, while the seams of bituminous coal\r\ndo not even average these last figures in thickness. Neither is the\r\nentire thickness of a seam made up of pure coal. Bands of slate called\r\n“partings” usually run horizontally through a seam, dividing it into\r\n“benches.” These partings vary from a fraction of an inch to several\r\nfeet in thickness, and make up from one fifth to one seventh of the\r\nentire seam.\r\n\r\nThe rock strata between the coal seams range from three feet to three\r\nhundred feet in thickness, and in exceptional cases go as high as five\r\nor six hundred feet. Perhaps a fair average would be from eighty to one\r\nhundred feet. These rock intervals are made up mostly of sandstones\r\nand shales. The combined average thickness of the coal seams of\r\nPennsylvania varies from twenty-five feet at Pittsburgh in the western\r\nbituminous region to one hundred and twenty feet at Pottsville in the\r\neastern anthracite district, and may be said to average about one\r\nfiftieth of the entire thickness of the coal measures, which is placed\r\nat 4,000 feet.\r\n\r\nSome conception may be had of the enormous vegetable deposits of the\r\nCarboniferous era by recalling the fact that the resultant coal in\r\neach seam is only from one ninth to one sixteenth in bulk of the woody\r\nfibre from which it has been derived, the loss being mainly in oxygen\r\nand hydrogen. It is probable that the coal seams as well as the rock\r\nstrata had attained a comparative degree of hardness before the close\r\nof the Carboniferous age. It was at the close of this age that those\r\nprofound disturbances of the earth’s crust throughout eastern North\r\nAmerica took place which have already been referred to. Hitherto,\r\nthrough the long ages of Paleozoic time, there had been comparative\r\nquiet. As cooling and contraction of the earth’s body were still going\r\non, there were doubtless oscillations of surface and subsidence of\r\nstrata in almost continuous progress. But these movements were very\r\nslow, amounting, perhaps, to not more than a foot in a century. Yet\r\nin Pennsylvania and Virginia the sinking of the crust up to the close\r\nof the Carboniferous age amounted to 35,000 or 40,000 feet. That the\r\nsubsidence was quiet and unmarked by violent movement is attested by\r\nthe regularity of strata, especially of the carboniferous measures,\r\nwhich alone show a sinking of 3,000 or 4,000 feet. Neither were the\r\ndisturbances which followed violent, nor were the changes paroxysmal.\r\nIndeed, the probability is that they took place gradually through\r\nlong periods of time. They were, nevertheless, productive of enormous\r\nresults in the shape of hills, peaks, and mountain ranges. These\r\nmovements in the earth’s crust were due, as always, to contractions\r\nin the earth’s body or reductions in its bulk. On the same principle\r\nby which the skin of an apple that has dried without decay is thrown\r\ninto folds and wrinkles, the earth’s crust became corrugated. There\r\nis this difference, however: the crust, being hard and unyielding,\r\nhas often been torn and broken in the process of change. Naturally\r\nthese ridges in the earth’s surface have been lifted along the lines\r\nof least resistance, and these lines seem to have been, at the time of\r\nthe Appalachian revolution, practically parallel to the line of the\r\nAtlantic coast, though long spurs were thrown out in other directions,\r\nisolated dome-shaped elevations were raised up, and bowl-shaped valleys\r\nwere hollowed out among the hills.\r\n\r\nThe anthracite coal beds were in the regions of greatest disturbance,\r\nand, together with the rock strata above and below them, assumed new\r\npositions, which were inclined at all angles to their old ones of\r\nhorizontality. More than this, the heat and pressure of that period\r\nexerted upon these beds of coal, which up to this time had been\r\nbituminous in character, resulted in the expulsion of so large a\r\nportion of the volatile matter still remaining in them as to change\r\ntheir character from bituminous to anthracite. Although the strata,\r\nin the positions to which they have been forced, are at times broken\r\nand abrupt, yet as a rule they rise and fall in wave-like folds or\r\nridges. These ridges are called _anticlinals_, because the strata slope\r\nin opposite directions from a common plane. The valleys between the\r\nridges are called _synclinals_, because the strata slope from opposite\r\ndirections toward a common plane. One result of this great force of\r\ncompression exerted on the earth’s crust was to make rents in it across\r\nthe lines of strata. These rents are called _fissures_. Sometimes\r\nthe faces of a fissure are parallel and sometimes they inclose a\r\nwedge-shaped cavity. This cavity, whatever its shape, is usually filled\r\neither with igneous rock that has come up from the molten mass below,\r\nor with surface drift or broken rock fragments that have been deposited\r\nthere from above. Where there is displacement as well as fracture, that\r\nis when the strata on one side of a fissure have been pushed up or have\r\nfallen below the corresponding strata on the other side, we have what\r\nis known as a _fault_. Sometimes the displacement seems to have been\r\naccomplished with little disturbance to the sides of the fissure; at\r\nother times we find, along the line of fracture, evidences of great\r\ndestruction caused by the pushing up of strata in this way. A fault\r\nmay reach a comparatively short distance, or it may traverse a country\r\nfor miles. The vertical displacement may be only a few inches, or it\r\nmay amount to hundreds or thousands of feet. In the bituminous coal\r\nregions, where the strata lie comparatively undisturbed, faults are\r\nbut little known. In the anthracite districts they are common, but not\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VERTICAL SECTION THROUGH SOUTHERN COAL FIELD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VERTICAL SECTION THROUGH NORTHERN COAL FIELD.]\r\n\r\nBesides the great folds into which the earth’s crust was crowded, there\r\nare usually smaller folds corrugating the slopes of the greater\r\nones, sometimes running parallel with them, oftener stretching across\r\nthem at various angles. A marked instance of this formation is found in\r\nthe Wyoming coal basin, the general coal bed of which is in the shape\r\nof a canoe, about fifty miles long, from two to six miles broad, and\r\nwith a maximum depth of perhaps one thousand feet. Running diagonally\r\nacross this basin, in practically parallel lines from one extremity to\r\nthe other, is a series of gentle anticlinals, dividing the basin into\r\nsome thirty smaller synclinal valleys or sub-basins.\r\n\r\nThe irregularities produced by folds, fissures, faults, and partings\r\nare not the only ones with which the miner has to deal. So far we\r\nhave supposed the coal seams to have been laid down in horizontal\r\nlayers of uniform thickness, with smooth and regular under and upper\r\nsurfaces. This is true only in a large sense. As a matter of fact\r\neach separate seam varies greatly in thickness, and its roof and\r\nfloor are often broken and irregular. The beds of clay on which the\r\ndeposits were laid were pushed up unevenly by the exuberant growth\r\nof vegetation from them. The action of waves and ocean currents made\r\nhollows in them, and laid down ridges and mounds of sand on them,\r\naround and over which the decaying vegetation rose and hardened. The\r\nsame forces, together with the action of running streams, made channels\r\nand hollows in the upper surfaces of these beds of incipient coal,\r\nwhich cavities became filled by sand and gravel, and this also hardened\r\ninto rock. These irregularities are found by the miner of to-day in\r\nthe floor and roof of the coal seam, and are called _rolls_, _horses_,\r\nor _horse-backs_. When the coal seam thins out so rapidly that the\r\nfloor and roof come nearly together, this state of things is called a\r\n_pinch_, or _squeeze_, though the latter term is more properly applied\r\nto the settling of the roof rock after the coal has been mined out.\r\nThe inequalities of a coal seam that have now been mentioned, although\r\nperhaps but a small portion of those that are daily met with in the\r\nprocess of mining, are neverthless characteristic of the whole.\r\n\r\nThe hills and mountain ranges that were thrown up at the close of the\r\nCarboniferous age were many times higher and broader then than they\r\nare to-day. Heat and cold and the storms of a thousand centuries,\r\nworking by disintegration and erosion, have worn away their substance,\r\nthe valleys and low lands are filled with it, and the rivers are\r\nalways carrying it down to the sea. The peaks and the crests have\r\nbeen the portions of the elevations that have suffered most. It is\r\noften as though the tops of the anticlinal folds had been sliced off\r\nfor the purpose of filling the valleys with them to the level of the\r\ndecapitated hills. A great part of the coal measures have thus wasted\r\naway; in some portions of the anthracite district by far the greater\r\npart, including many valuable coal seams.\r\n\r\nWhen a fold or flexure of the earth’s crust has been decapitated in\r\nthe manner mentioned, the exposed edge of any stratum of rock or\r\ncoal is called its _outcrop_. The angle of inclination at which any\r\nstratum descends into the earth is called its _dip_. The direction of\r\na horizontal line drawn along the face of a stratum of rock or coal is\r\nits _strike_. It is obvious that the strike must always be at right\r\nangles to the dip. That is, if the dip is downward toward the east or\r\ntoward the west, the direction of the strike must be north and south.\r\nIt is now apparent that if one begins at the outcrop of a coal seam\r\nand traces the course of the seam downward along the line of dip, his\r\npath will lie down the inclination for a longer or shorter distance,\r\nuntil the bottom of the synclinal valley is reached. This is known as\r\nthe _basin_ or _swamp_. Here the seam may be comparatively level for\r\na short distance; more often it has a mild vertical curve, and starts\r\nup the dip on the other side of the valley, which inclination may be\r\nfollowed till the outcrop is reached. If now the decapitated portion of\r\nthe fold could be replaced in its natural position, we could trace the\r\nsame seam up to and over the anticlinal axis and down upon the other\r\nside. As it is, we must cross on the surface from the outcrop to the\r\nplace where the corresponding seam enters the earth. In the southern\r\nand eastern anthracite coal districts of Pennsylvania decapitation of\r\nfolds to a point below the coal measures is general; the coal seams\r\ndip into the earth with a very sharp pitch, and the coal basins are\r\noften very deep and very narrow, striking into the earth almost like\r\na wedge. In the northern or Wyoming district decapitation is not so\r\ngeneral, the angle of inclination of strata is mild, and the basins are\r\nwide and comparatively shallow. In the bituminous districts, where the\r\ndisturbance to the earth’s crust has been slight, the coal beds lie\r\nvery nearly as they were formed, the dip seldom exceeding an angle of\r\nfive degrees with the horizon. The exposures here are due generally to\r\nthe erosive action of water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD OPENING INTO AN OUT-CROP OF THE BALTIMORE VEIN.]\r\n\r\nThe carboniferous measures are the highest and latest geological\r\nformation in the great coal fields of the United States. Therefore\r\nwhere the strata have not been disturbed by flexure the coal seams\r\nlie near the surface. This is generally the case in the bituminous\r\ndistricts, and it is also partially true in the northern anthracite\r\ncoal field. Deep mining is necessary only in the middle and southern\r\nanthracite coal fields, where the folds are close and precipitous,\r\nand the deep and narrow basins formed by them have been filled with\r\ndeposits of a later geologic age.\r\n\r\nSome of the difficulties to be met and overcome in mining coal will by\r\nthis time have been appreciated by the reader. But some of them only.\r\nThe inequalities of roof and floor, the pitching seams, the folds\r\nand faults and fissures, all the accidents and irregularities of\r\nformation and of location, make up but a few of the problems which\r\nface the mining engineer. But the intellect and ingenuity of men have\r\novercome most of the obstacles which Nature placed in the way of\r\nsuccessful mining when she hardened the rocks above her coal beds,\r\ncrowded the earth’s crust into folds, and lifted the mountain ranges\r\ninto the air.\r\n\r\nIt will not be out of place at this time to make mention of those\r\nlocalities in which coal is found. Indeed, there are few countries on\r\nthe globe in which there are not carboniferous deposits of greater\r\nor less extent. Great Britain, with Ireland, has about 12,000 square\r\nmiles of them. In England alone there is an area of 8,139 square miles\r\nof workable coal beds. In continental Europe the coal fields are\r\nnumerous, but the character of the deposit is inferior. Coal is found\r\nalso in the Asiatic countries, in Australia, and in South America; and\r\nin Nova Scotia and New Brunswick there is an area of 18,000 square\r\nmiles of coal measures. The combined areas of coal measures in the\r\nUnited States amount to about 185,000 square miles. The Appalachian\r\nor Alleghany region contains about 60,000 square miles, included in\r\nthe States of Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia, Maryland, Ohio,\r\nKentucky, Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama. The Illinois and Missouri\r\nregion contains also about 60,000 square miles, and has areas not only\r\nin the States named, but also in Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Kansas,\r\nand Arkansas. Michigan has about 5,000 and Rhode Island about 500\r\nsquare miles. There are also small areas in Utah and Texas, and in the\r\nfar West there are workable coal fields in Colorado, Dakota, Indian\r\nTerritory, Montana, New Mexico, Washington, Wyoming Territory, Oregon,\r\nand California. The entire coal area of the United States, with the\r\nexception of that in Rhode Island and a few outlying sections in\r\nPennsylvania, contains coal of the bituminous variety only. Both the\r\narea and supply are therefore practically without limit. In the coal\r\nregions of Rhode Island the disturbances affecting the earth’s crust\r\nhave been very violent. The motion, heat, and compression have been so\r\ngreat as to give the rocks associated with the coal measures a true\r\nmetamorphic or crystalline structure, and to transform the coal itself\r\ninto an extremely hard anthracite; in some places, indeed, it has\r\nbeen altered to graphite. The flexures of the coal formation are very\r\nabrupt and full of faults, and the coal itself is greatly broken and\r\ndisplaced. Its condition is such that it cannot be mined with great\r\nprofit, and but little of it is now sent to market. The only areas\r\nof readily workable anthracite in the United States are therefore in\r\nPennsylvania. These are all east of the Alleghany Mountains, and are\r\nlocated in four distinct regions. The first or Southern Coal Field\r\nextends from the Lehigh River at Mauch Chunk, southwest to within a\r\nfew miles of the Susquehanna River, ending at this extremity in the\r\nform of a fish’s tail. It is seventy-five miles in length, averages\r\nsomewhat less than two miles in breadth, and has an area of one hundred\r\nand forty square miles. It lies in Carbon, Schuylkill, and Dauphin\r\ncounties. The second or Western Middle field, known also as the Mahanoy\r\nand Shamokin field, lies between the eastern headwaters of the Little\r\nSchuylkill River and the Susquehanna River. It has an area of about\r\nninety square miles, and is situated in the counties of Schuylkill,\r\nColumbia, and Northumberland. It lies just north of the Southern field,\r\nand the two together are frequently spoken of as the Schuylkill Region.\r\nThe Eastern Middle or Upper Lehigh field lies northeast of the first\r\ntwo fields, and is separated into nine distinct parallel canoe-shaped\r\nbasins. These extend from the Lehigh River on the east to the Catawissa\r\nCreek on the west, and comprise an area of about forty miles. They\r\nare principally in Luzerne County, but extend also into Carbon,\r\nSchuylkill, and Columbia counties. The Northern or Wyoming field is a\r\ncrescent-shaped basin about fifty miles long and from two to six miles\r\nbroad, with an area of about two hundred square miles. Its westerly\r\ncusp is just north of the Eastern Middle field, and it extends from\r\nthat point northeasterly through Luzerne and Lackawanna counties, just\r\ncutting into Wayne and Susquehanna counties with its northern cusp. It\r\nlies in the valleys of the Susquehanna and Lackawanna rivers, and in\r\nit are situated the mining towns of Plymouth, Wilkes Barre, Pittston,\r\nScranton, and Carbondale. There is also a fifth district, known as\r\nthe Loyalsock and Mehoopany coal field, lying in Sullivan and Wyoming\r\ncounties. It is from twenty to twenty-five miles northwest of the\r\nWyoming and Lackawanna field, its area is limited, and its coals are\r\nnot true anthracite.\r\n\r\nIt will thus be seen that aside from this last field the anthracite\r\ncoal area of Pennsylvania contains about four hundred and seventy\r\nsquare miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE DISCOVERY OF COAL.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough it has been within comparatively recent times that coal has\r\ncome into general use as a fuel, yet there can be no doubt that it was\r\ndiscovered, and that its qualities were known, many centuries ago. To\r\nprove its use by the ancients, mention is sometimes made of a passage\r\nfrom the writings of Theophrastus, a pupil and friend of Aristotle\r\nand for many years the head of the peripatetic school of philosophy.\r\nThis passage dates back to about 300 B. C., and is as follows: “Those\r\nsubstances that are called coals and are broken for use are earthy, but\r\nthey kindle and burn like wooden coals. They are found in Liguria where\r\nthere is amber, and in Elis over the mountains toward Olympus. They are\r\nused by the smiths.”\r\n\r\nThe word “coal,” however, as used in the Bible and other ancient\r\nbooks, usually means charcoal, or burning wood. It is claimed, and\r\nnot without plausibility, that coal was mined in Britain prior to the\r\nRoman invasion. The cinder heaps found among ruins of the time of Roman\r\nsupremacy in the island point to quite an extensive use of coal by the\r\npeople of that age. But no writings have been found recording the use\r\nof coal prior to 852 A. D. In that year twelve cartloads of “fossil\r\nfuel,” or “pit coal,” were received by the abbey of Peterborough in\r\nEngland, and the receipt was recorded. It is said that coal first began\r\nto be systematically mined in Great Britain about the year 1180.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that by the end of the thirteenth century the exportation\r\nof coal from Newcastle was considerable, and the new fuel had come\r\nto be largely used in London. But the people of that city conceived\r\nthe idea that its use was injurious to the health of the inhabitants\r\ngenerally. The coal, being of the bituminous variety, burned with\r\nconsiderable flame and gave off a good deal of smoke, and the ignorance\r\nof the people led them into the belief that the air was contaminated\r\nand poisoned by the products of combustion. So they presented a\r\npetition to Parliament asking that the burning of coal be prohibited in\r\nthe city of London. Not only was the prayer of the petitioners granted,\r\nbut in order to render the prohibition effectual an act was passed\r\nmaking it a capital offense to burn the dreaded fuel. This was in the\r\nreign of Edward I., and is characteristic of the policy of that strong,\r\nunyielding king, whose ends, great and just perhaps, were too often\r\nattained by harsh and cruel means.\r\n\r\nThe coal industry was checked, but it was not destroyed; for, half\r\na century later, we find Edward III. granting a license to the\r\ninhabitants of Newcastle “to dig coals and stones in the common soil of\r\nthe town without the walls thereof in the place called the Castle Field\r\nand the Forth.” Afterward this town, owing to the fine coal beds in its\r\nvicinity, became one of the great centres of the British coal trade,\r\nfrom which fact doubtless arose that ancient saying concerning useless\r\ntrouble or labor, that it is like “carrying coals to Newcastle.”\r\n\r\nIn Scotland coal was mined in the twelfth century and in Germany in\r\nthe thirteenth, and the Chinese had already become familiar with its\r\nuse. But in Paris the same prejudice was excited against it that had\r\nprevailed in London, and it did not come into use in that city as a\r\nhousehold fuel until about the middle of the sixteenth century. This\r\nwas also the date of its introduction into Wales, Belgium, and other\r\nEuropean countries.\r\n\r\nThat coal was familiar, in appearance at least, to the natives of\r\nAmerica, long before the feet of white men ever pressed American\r\nsoil, cannot well be doubted. They must have seen it at its numerous\r\noutcrops; perhaps they took pieces of it in their hard hands, handled\r\nit, broke it, powdered it, or cast it away from them as useless.\r\nIndeed, it is not improbable that they should have known something\r\nof its qualities as a fuel. But of this there is no proof. The\r\nfirst record we have of the observation of coal in this country was\r\nmade by Father Hennepin, a French explorer, in 1679. On a map of his\r\nexplorations he marked the site of a coal mine on the bank of the\r\nIllinois River above Fort Crevecœur, near the present town of Ottawa.\r\nIn his record of travel he states that in the country then occupied\r\nby the Pimitoui or Pimitwi Indians “there are mines of coal, slate,\r\nand iron.” The oldest coal workings in America are doubtless those in\r\nwhat is known as the Richmond or Chesterfield coal bed, near Richmond\r\nin Chesterfield and Powhatan counties in the State of Virginia. It is\r\nsupposed that coal was discovered and mined there as early as 1750.\r\nBut by whom and under what circumstances the discovery was made we\r\nhave only tradition to inform us. This says that one day, during\r\nthe year last named, a certain boy, living in that vicinity, went\r\nout into an unfrequented district on a private and personal fishing\r\nexcursion. Either the fish bit better than he had thought they would,\r\nor for some other cause his supply of bait ran out, and it became\r\nnecessary for him to renew it. Hunting around in the small creeks and\r\ninlets for crawfish with which to bait his hook, he chanced to stumble\r\nupon the outcrop of a coal bed which crosses the James River about\r\ntwelve miles above Richmond. He made his discovery known, and further\r\nexamination disclosed a seam of rich bituminous coal, which has since\r\nbeen conceded to be a formation of Mesozoic time rather than of the\r\nCarboniferous age. Mining operations were soon begun, and were carried\r\non so successfully that by the year 1775 the coal was in general use\r\nin the vicinity for smithing and domestic purposes. It played a part\r\nin the war for independence by entering into the manufacture of cannon\r\nballs, and by 1789 it had achieved so much of a reputation that it\r\nwas being shipped to Philadelphia, New York, and Boston, and sold in\r\nthose markets. But the mines were operated by slave labor, and mining\r\nwas carried on in the most primitive fashion for three quarters of a\r\ncentury. So late as 1860 the improved systems of mining, long in use in\r\nthe North, were still comparatively unknown at the Virginia mines.\r\n\r\nDuring the war of the rebellion these mines were seized by the\r\nConfederate government and operated by it, in order to obtain directly\r\nthe necessary fuel for purposes of modern warfare; and upon the\r\ncessation of hostilities the paralysis which had fallen upon all other\r\nSouthern industries fell also upon this. But with the revival of\r\nbusiness, mining was again begun in the Richmond field, and from 1874\r\nto the present time the industry has prospered and grown, and Virginia\r\nhas furnished to the country at large a considerable amount of an\r\nexcellent quality of bituminous coal. This coal bed covers an area of\r\nabout 180 square miles, and has an average thickness of twenty-four\r\nfeet. It is supposed to contain about 50,000,000 of tons yet unmined.\r\n\r\nAnother of the early discoveries of coal in the United States was that\r\nof the Rhode Island anthracite bed in 1760. Mines began to be regularly\r\nworked here in 1808, but only about 750,000 tons, all told, have been\r\ntaken from them. For reasons which have been already given these mines\r\ncannot be profitably worked in competition with the anthracite mines of\r\nPennsylvania, in which the location and formation of the coal beds are\r\ngreatly superior.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say when the coal of the great bituminous district\r\nof Pennsylvania and Ohio was first seen by white men. In the summer of\r\n1755 General Braddock led his army through western Pennsylvania by a\r\nmilitary road to that terrible defeat and slaughter in which he himself\r\nreceived his death wound. This road, laid out by the army’s engineers\r\nand graded by its men, was so well built that its course can still be\r\ntraced, and it is seen to have crossed the outcrop of the Pittsburgh\r\ncoal seam in many places. It is not improbable that a large number of\r\nthe soldiers in the English army were familiar with the appearance of\r\ncoal, and knew how to mine it and use it. Indeed, Colonel James Burd,\r\nwho was engaged in the construction of the road, claims to have burned\r\nabout a bushel of this coal on his camp-fire at that time.\r\n\r\nSome of the English soldiers who survived that terrible disaster to\r\ntheir arms afterward returned and purchased lands in the vicinity, and\r\nit is reasonable to suppose that the coal was dug and put to use by\r\nthem. A lease, still in existence, dated April 11, 1767, making a grant\r\nof lands on “Coal Pitt Creek,” in Westmoreland County, indicates that\r\nthere were coal openings there at that date. Captain Thomas Hutchins,\r\nwho visited Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh) in 1760, mentions the fact that\r\nhe found an open coal mine on the opposite side of the Monongahela\r\nRiver, from which coal was being taken for the use of the garrison.\r\n\r\nFrom 1770 to 1777 it was common for maps of certain portions of the\r\nOhio River country to have marked on them sites of coal beds along the\r\nshores of that stream in regions which are now known to contain seams\r\nof the great bituminous deposit.\r\n\r\nProbably the Susquehanna River region was the first in which this coal\r\nwas dug systematically and put to use. It was burned by blacksmiths\r\nin their forges, and as early as 1785 the river towns were supplied\r\nwith it by Samuel Boyd, who shipped it from his mines in arks. In 1813\r\nPhilip Karthaus took a quantity of coal to Fort Deposit, and sent it\r\nthence by canal to Philadelphia. After this he sent cargoes regularly\r\nto Philadelphia and Baltimore, and sold them readily at the rate of\r\nthirty-three cents per bushel. This trade was stopped, however, by\r\nthe building of dams across the Susquehanna, and it was not until many\r\nyears afterward that the mineral resources of this section of the coal\r\nfield were developed again through the introduction of railroads.\r\n\r\nIn the Pittsburgh region the demand for coal increased with the\r\nincrease of population, and at the beginning of the present century\r\nit was in general use, not only in the manufacturing industries but\r\nalso as a domestic fuel, throughout that section of country. The\r\nfirst coal sent from Pittsburgh to an eastern market was shipped to\r\nPhiladelphia in 1803. It was carried by the Louisiana, a boat of 350\r\ntons burden, and was sold at the rate of thirty-seven and a half cents\r\nper bushel. From that time the increase in the mining of bituminous\r\ncoal in the Pittsburgh region has been steady and enormous. Its\r\npresence, its quality and abundance, have induced the establishment\r\nof great manufacturing enterprises in that section of the State, and\r\nmany millions of tons of it are sent every year to the markets of the\r\nseaboard.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania was a region much in favor with the North American\r\nIndians, and it is more than probable that they were aware, to some\r\nextent, of the existence of mineral wealth beneath her soil, long\r\nbefore white men ever came among them.\r\n\r\nBesides the numerous outcroppings of coal which, in their journeyings,\r\nthey must have crossed and recrossed for centuries, there were\r\nmany places where the coal seams, having been cut through by creeks\r\nand rivers, were exposed fully to view. In this way, in the Wyoming\r\ndistrict, the seven feet vein along the Nanticoke Creek had been\r\ndisclosed, and the nine feet vein on Ransom’s Creek at Plymouth;\r\nwhile at Pittston the Susquehanna River had bared the coal seams in\r\nthe faces of its rocky banks, and up the Lackawanna the black strata\r\nwere frequently visible. But whatever knowledge the Indians had on the\r\nsubject was, with proverbial reticence, kept to themselves. It is said\r\nthat about the year 1750 a party of Indians brought a bag of coal to a\r\ngunsmith living near Nazareth in Pennsylvania, but refused to say where\r\nthey had obtained it. The gunsmith burned it successfully in the forge\r\nwhich he used for the purpose of repairing their guns.\r\n\r\nThe presumption that the Indians knew something of the uses of coal,\r\nand actually mined it, is borne out by the following incident: In the\r\nyear 1766 a trader by the name of John Anderson was settled at Wyoming,\r\nand carried on a small business as a shopkeeper, trading largely with\r\nthe red men. In September of that year a company of six Nanticoke,\r\nConoy, and Mohican Indians visited the governor at Philadelphia, and\r\nmade to him the following address:――\r\n\r\n“Brother,――As we came down from Chenango we stopped at Wyoming, where\r\nwe had a mine in two places, and we discovered that some white people\r\nhad been at work in the mine, and had filled three canoes with the ore;\r\nand we saw their tools with which they had dug it out of the ground,\r\nwhere they had made a hole at least forty feet long and five or six\r\nfeet deep. It happened formerly that some white people did take, now\r\nand then, only a small bit and carry it away, but these people have\r\nbeen working at the mine, and have filled their canoes. We desire that\r\nyou will tell us whether you know anything of this matter, or if it be\r\ndone by your consent. We inform you that there is one John Anderson, a\r\ntrader, now living at Wyoming, and we suspect that he, or somebody by\r\nhim, has robbed our mine. This man has a store of goods there, and it\r\nmay happen when the Indians see their mine robbed they will come and\r\ntake away his goods.”\r\n\r\nThere is little doubt that the mines referred to were coal mines.\r\nThe presence of coal on the same side of the river a few miles below\r\nWyoming was certainly known, if not at that time then very soon\r\nafterward; for in 1768 Charles Stewart made a survey of the Manor of\r\nSunbury opposite Wilkes Barre for the “Proprietaries’” government, and\r\non the original map of the survey “stone coal” is noted as appearing on\r\nthe site of what is now called Rosshill.\r\n\r\nThis valley of Wyoming, the seat of such vast mineral wealth, was\r\nfirst settled by people from Connecticut in 1762, and in the fall of\r\nthat year they reported the discovery of coal.\r\n\r\nThese energetic, enterprising Yankee settlers could not fail to know\r\nthe location of the coal beds before they had been long in the valley.\r\nSome of them were probably familiar with the English bituminous coals,\r\nwhich were then being exported in small quantities to America under the\r\nname of “sea coal;” and from the fact that our anthracite was known\r\nto them as “stone coal” it is probable that there were those among\r\nthem who knew that the English people had a very hard coal which they\r\ncould not burn, and to which they had given the name “stone coal.”\r\nSpecimens of this Wyoming valley stone coal had already been gathered\r\nand sent to England for examination. Indeed, there is no doubt that the\r\nfirst anthracite coal ever found by white men in the United States was\r\ndiscovered in this valley. But these Yankee settlers could not make\r\ntheir stone coal burn. Repeated trials met with repeated failures.\r\nThere was one among them, however, Obadiah Gore, a blacksmith, who\r\nwould not be discouraged. In 1769 he took a quantity of these coals to\r\nthe blacksmith’s shop conducted by him and his brother, put them in\r\nhis forge, and continued his efforts and experiments until finally the\r\nblack lumps yielded to his persistency, and he had the satisfaction of\r\nseeing the blue flames dart from them, and the red color creep over\r\nthem, and of feeling the intense heat sent out by their combustion. But\r\ntheir ignition and burning were dependent upon the strong air current\r\nsent through them by the bellows; without that he could do nothing with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nSo this Yankee blacksmith, who was afterwards one of the associate\r\njudges of the courts of Luzerne County, became, so far as is known, the\r\nfirst white man to demonstrate practically the value of anthracite coal\r\nas a fuel. The success of Gore’s experiments soon became known, other\r\nsmiths began to recognize the merits of the lately despised stone coal,\r\nand it was not long before the forge fires of nearly every smithy in\r\nthe region were ablaze with anthracite.\r\n\r\nThe fame of the new fuel soon spread beyond the limits of the valley,\r\nand if the difficulties of transportation checked its use elsewhere,\r\nthe knowledge of how to use it in forges and furnaces was not uncommon.\r\nThe demand for it overcame, at times, even the obstacles in the way of\r\nshipment, and it was sent to points at long distances from the mines.\r\n\r\nIn 1776 the proprietary government of Pennsylvania had an armory at\r\nCarlisle in that State, in which they were manufacturing firearms to be\r\nused by the Continental troops in the war with Great Britain; and the\r\nfirst coal ever sent out from the Wyoming valley was shipped by them\r\nto Carlisle during that year and the succeeding years of the war, for\r\nuse in their armory.\r\n\r\nThe next discoveries of anthracite were made in what is now known\r\nas the Southern coal field. It had long been a matter of tradition\r\namong the stolid German farmers of Pennsylvania that coal existed\r\nin the rugged hills along the Lehigh River, but no one succeeded in\r\nfinding it there until the year 1791. It was then discovered by one\r\nPhilip Ginther, a hunter and backwoodsman, who had built a rough\r\ncabin in the forest near the Mauch Chunk mountain, and there gave to\r\nhimself and his family a precarious support by killing game, large\r\nand small, carrying it to the nearest settlement, and exchanging it\r\nat the village store for the necessaries of life. Telling the story\r\nafterward, himself, he said that at one time the supply of food in\r\nhis cabin chanced to run out, and he started into the woods with his\r\ngun in quest of something which should satisfy the hunger of those\r\nwho were at home. It was a most unsuccessful hunting expedition. The\r\nmorning passed, the afternoon went by, night approached, but his\r\ngame-bag was still empty. He was tired, hungry, and sadly disappointed.\r\nA drizzling rain set in as he started homeward across the Mauch Chunk\r\nmountain, darkness was coming rapidly on, and despondency filled his\r\nmind as he thought of the expectant faces of little ones at home to\r\nwhom he was returning empty-handed. Making his way slowly through\r\nthe thick, wet undergrowth, and still looking about him, if perchance\r\nsomething in the way of game might yet come within the range of his\r\ngun, his foot happened to strike a hard substance which rolled away\r\nbefore him. He looked down at it, and then bent over and picked it up,\r\nand saw by the deepening twilight that it was black. He was familiar\r\nwith the traditions of the country concerning the existence of stone\r\ncoal in this region, and he began to wonder if this, indeed, was not\r\na specimen of it. He carried the black lump home with him that night,\r\nand the next day he set out with it to find Colonel Jacob Weiss at\r\nFort Allen, now Weissport, to whom he exhibited what he had found.\r\nColonel Weiss became deeply interested in the matter, and brought the\r\nspecimen to Philadelphia, where he submitted it to the inspection of\r\nJohn Nicholson, Michael Hillegas, and Charles Cist. These men, after\r\nassuring themselves that it was really anthracite coal, authorized\r\nColonel Weiss to make such a contract with Ginther as would induce\r\nhim to point out the exact spot where the mineral was found. It\r\nhappened that the hunter coveted a vacant piece of land in the vicinity\r\ncontaining a fine water-power and mill-site, and on Colonel Weiss\r\nagreeing to obtain a patent for him from the State for the desired lot\r\nof land, he very readily gave all the information in his possession\r\nconcerning the “stone coal.”\r\n\r\nIn the Pottsville district of the Southern anthracite region coal was\r\ndiscovered at about the same time as in the Mauch Chunk field. This\r\ndiscovery too was made by accident, and the discoverer in this case\r\nalso was a hunter, Nicholas Allen. He had been out with his gun all\r\nday, and at nightfall had found himself too far away from his home\r\nto make the attempt to reach it. He accordingly built a fire under a\r\nprojecting ledge at the foot of Broad Mountain, and, lying down by\r\nit, soon fell asleep. He was wakened in the night by a strong light\r\nshining on his eyes, and by the sensation of great heat. Springing\r\nto his feet, he discovered that the ledge itself was burning, or, as\r\nhe afterward expressed it, “that the mountain was on fire.” He could\r\nnot understand the phenomenon, and remained in the vicinity until\r\nmorning, when he saw, by daylight, that what he had thought to be a\r\nledge of rocks was really a projecting outcrop of mineral coal, which\r\nhad become ignited from his camp-fire of sticks. Whether this story is\r\nor is not authentic, it is certain that no practical results attended\r\nthe discovery of coal in this region. It was not until twenty-six\r\nyears after Obadiah Gore’s experiments in the Wyoming valley that coal\r\nwas successfully burned here in a blacksmith’s forge. The attempt\r\nwas made by one Whetstone, and met with the same marked success that\r\nhad attended the earlier effort. But owing to the difficulty still\r\nordinarily experienced in combustion, the coal of this region was not\r\ngenerally used until after the year 1806. In that year David Berlin,\r\nanother blacksmith, experimented with it in his forge, with such\r\ncomplete success that a new impetus was given to the coal trade, mining\r\nwas resumed, and the new fuel came into general use in the blacksmiths’\r\nshops of the vicinity.\r\n\r\nIn the Middle anthracite district coal was not discovered until 1826.\r\nThis discovery also was made by a hunter, John Charles. On one of his\r\nhunting expeditions he chanced to find a groundhog’s hole, and, laying\r\ndown his rifle, he began to dig for his game. In the course of the\r\nexcavation he uncovered a projecting shelf of stone coal. He made his\r\ndiscovery known, further explorations were set on foot, the coal bed\r\nwas located, and a company called the Hazleton Coal Company was formed\r\nto work the field.\r\n\r\nFrom these several points of discovery the search for anthracite coal\r\nwas extended in all directions, the limits of the beds were eventually\r\ndefined, and each field was surveyed and mapped with much care.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE INTRODUCTION OF COAL INTO USE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the present century the anthracite or stone coal\r\nwas in general use, in all the districts where it was found, as a fuel\r\nfor the blacksmith’s fire and the iron worker’s forge. This, however,\r\nwas the limit of its utility. It was thought to be necessary to force a\r\nstrong artificial air current up through it to make it burn, and since\r\nthis could not well be done in grates, stoves, or furnaces, there was\r\nno demand for coal for domestic use, or for the great manufacturing\r\nindustries. Efforts were indeed made to overcome this difficulty.\r\nSchemes without number were set on foot and abandoned. It was proposed,\r\nat one time, to force air through a tube to the under part of the grate\r\nby means of clockwork operated by a weight or by a spring. But the cost\r\nof such an arrangement made it impracticable.\r\n\r\nIt seems, however, that Weiss, Cist, and Hillegas, who were developing\r\nthe discovery made by Ginther in the Mauch Chunk mountain, also solved\r\nthe problem of burning the stone coal without an artificial draft. They\r\nhad sent specimens of their coals to Philadelphia, and presumably had\r\naccompanied them with instructions as to the proper method of burning\r\nthem. This presumption is borne out by certain letters sent to Jacob\r\nCist of Wilkes Barre, a son of Charles Cist the printer, who was in\r\ncompany with Weiss and Hillegas. Two of these letters are now in the\r\npossession of the Wyoming Historical and Geological Society at Wilkes\r\nBarre. An extract from one of them reads as follows:――\r\n\r\n    “I have experienced the use of them” (the Lehigh coals) “in\r\n    a close stove and also in a fireplace that may be closed and\r\n    opened at pleasure, so constructed, as to cause a brisk current\r\n    of air to pass up through a small contracted grate on which\r\n    they were laid. I find them more difficult to be kindled than\r\n    the Virginia coal, yet a small quantity of dry wood laid on\r\n    the grate under them is sufficient to ignite them, which being\r\n    done, they continue to burn while a sufficient amount be added\r\n    to keep up the combustion, occasionally stirring them to keep\r\n    down the ashes. They produce no smoke, contain no sulphur, and\r\n    when well ignited exhibit a vivid bright appearance, all which\r\n    render them suitable for warming rooms.”\r\n\r\nThis letter is dated “Philadelphia, Feb. 15^th 1803,” and is signed\r\n“Oliver Evans.”\r\n\r\nThe second letter is similar in its recommendation and report of\r\nsuccess, and states that the writer, “Fred^k Graff, clerk of the\r\nWater Works of Phil^a ... made a trial of the Lehigh coals in the\r\nyear 1802 in the large stove at the Pennsylvania Bank in Phil^a.”\r\n\r\nSo far as is known these are the first recorded instances of any\r\nsuccessful attempts to burn anthracite coal in grates and stoves. Dr.\r\nJames of Philadelphia has also left on record the fact that he made\r\nconstant use of anthracite coal for heating purposes from the year 1804.\r\n\r\nThese well-authenticated instances of the use of anthracite appear to\r\ndestroy the commonly accepted belief that Judge Jesse Fell of Wilkes\r\nBarre was the first person whose attempts to burn this coal in an open\r\ngrate were rewarded with complete success. Nevertheless the value of\r\nJudge Fell’s experiments cannot be questioned, nor can he be deprived\r\nof the full measure of credit due to him for bringing those experiments\r\nto a successful issue.\r\n\r\nUntil the year 1808 all efforts in the Wyoming valley to burn the\r\n“stone coal” of the region without an artificial air blast had utterly\r\nfailed. People did not believe that it could be done. The successes\r\nof Evans and Graff in this direction were either not known or not\r\ncredited. It is certain that Judge Fell had not heard of them. His\r\nopinion that this coal could be made to burn in an open fireplace was\r\nbased wholly on the reasoning of his own mind. He was a member of the\r\nSociety of Friends, and had come to Wilkes Barre some years before\r\nfrom Berks County. He was a blacksmith by trade, the proprietor of the\r\nbest hotel in town, and he came afterward to be one of the associate\r\njudges of Luzerne County. When he had fully considered the matter of\r\nburning the stone coal, and had reached definite conclusions, he began\r\nto experiment. At first he constructed a grate of green hickory sticks,\r\nand the presumption is that the fire he kindled in it was a success;\r\nfor he began, immediately afterward, to make an iron grate similar to\r\nthe grates now in use. The work was done by his nephew Edward Fell and\r\nhimself in the blacksmith shop of the former, and was completed in a\r\nsingle day. Judge Fell took the grate home late in the afternoon and\r\nset it with brick in the fireplace of his bar-room. In the evening\r\nhe kindled in it, with oak wood, a glowing coal fire, and invited a\r\nlarge number of the most respected citizens of the place to come in\r\nand see the stone coal burn. Only a few came, however, in response\r\nto his invitation; they believed his theory to be impracticable, and\r\nfeared that they might be made the victims of a hoax. But to those\r\nwho came the fire was a revelation. It cleared the way for immense\r\npossibilities. Judge Fell himself realized the importance of his\r\ndiscovery, and thought the incident worthy of record. Being a devoted\r\nmember of the order of Free and Accepted Masons, he chose from his\r\nlibrary a book entitled “The Free Mason’s Monitor,” and wrote on the\r\nfly-leaf, in a clear, bold hand, this memorandum:――\r\n\r\n    “Fe’b 11^th, of Masonry 5808. Made the experiment of burning\r\n    the common stone coal of the valley in a grate in a common fire\r\n    place in my house, and find it will answer the purpose of fuel;\r\n    making a clearer and better fire, at less expense, than burning\r\n    wood in the common way.\r\n\r\n    [Signed] JESSE FELL.\r\n\r\n    “BOROUGH OF WILKESBARRE,\r\n    _February 11^th 1808_.”\r\n\r\nThe complete success of Judge Fell’s experiment was soon noised abroad,\r\nand a new era of usefulness for anthracite coal set in. From Wilkes\r\nBarre up and down the entire Wyoming valley fireplaces for wood were\r\ndiscarded and grates were set for the burning of the new domestic fuel.\r\nThis was followed, not long after, by the introduction of stoves, so\r\nthat by 1820, says Stewart Pearce in his “Annals of Luzerne County,”\r\ngrates and coal stoves were in general use throughout the valley, coal\r\nfor domestic purposes selling at three dollars per ton. At the time of\r\nJudge Fell’s experiment there was no outside market for the product\r\nof the mines of the Wyoming valley. The distances to the large cities\r\nand manufacturing centres were too great, the means of transportation\r\ntoo rude, and the knowledge of the use of anthracite too limited, to\r\nwarrant any serious effort to create a foreign market for it. The\r\nattempt had nevertheless been made in 1807 by Abijah Smith, who\r\nshipped an ark-load of coal down the Susquehanna River to Columbia, and\r\nwas obliged to leave it there unsold.\r\n\r\nIn 1808 the experiment was repeated by Abijah and his brother John,\r\nwho, profiting by the success of Judge Fell’s late experiment, took\r\nwith them an iron grate, set it up at Columbia, and proceeded to\r\ndemonstrate to the doubting inhabitants the practical value of their\r\ncoal as a domestic fuel. The venture proved successful, and after this\r\nthey found no difficulty in selling at the river towns all the coal\r\nthey could mine. After 1812 they extended their trade by running their\r\ncoal to Havre de Grace, and sending it thence by schooner to New York.\r\n\r\nThe success which attended the efforts of the Smiths appears to have\r\nbeen an inducement to other enterprising citizens of the Wyoming valley\r\nto embark in the coal trade, and in 1813 and 1814 Colonel George M.\r\nHollenback, Colonel Lord Butler, Joseph Wright, Esq., and Crandal\r\nWilcox all engaged in the mining and shipping of coal. They sent the\r\nproduct of the mines down the river in arks, and up to 1830 85,000\r\ntons had been mined in the valley for such shipment. After that year\r\ncoal was sent by the North Branch Canal just completed to Nanticoke,\r\nand in 1846 the Lehigh and Susquehanna Railroad pierced the valley,\r\nand opened a new era in transportation. So it came about that this\r\nregion, which in 1807 opened the anthracite coal trade with a shipment\r\nof fifty-five tons, sent to market in 1887 a grand total of 19,684,929\r\ntons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                  MAP\r\n                               _SHOWING_\r\n                       ·ANTHRACITE·COAL·FIELDS·\r\n                                -_OF_-\r\n                            ·PENNSYLVANIA·]\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Weiss, Cist, and Hillegas pushed their coal enterprise\r\non the Mauch Chunk mountain, opening what was afterward known as the\r\nGreat Summit Mine, and in 1803 started six ark-loads of coal down the\r\nLehigh River, to be floated to its junction with the Delaware, and\r\nthence to Philadelphia. Only two of the arks reached their destination,\r\nthe others having met with disaster on the way, owing to swift currents\r\nand unskillful navigation. Of the two cargoes that arrived safely\r\nat Philadelphia not a lump could be sold. The owners made strenuous\r\nefforts to find a market for it, but people did not wish to purchase\r\na fuel that they could not make burn. At last the city authorities\r\nwere appealed to, and, after some hesitation, they agreed to take the\r\ncoal and try to make use of it for a steam-engine employed at the city\r\nwaterworks. This they did; but all their attempts to make the alleged\r\nfuel burn proved unavailing. They finally gave up the task in disgust,\r\ndeclared the coal to be a nuisance, and caused what remained of it\r\nto be broken up and spread on the footpaths of the public grounds,\r\nin place of gravel. This was indeed a most ignominious failure. It\r\ncaused a sudden cessation of mining operations at Summit Hill, and for\r\nseveral years the Lehigh Mine Company, utterly discouraged, made no\r\neffort to retrieve its fallen fortunes. William Turnbull attempted to\r\nrevive the project a few years later, but his effort also met with a\r\ndismal failure.\r\n\r\nIn 1813 Charles Miner, Jacob Cist, and John W. Robinson, all of Wilkes\r\nBarre, renewed the enterprise at Summit Hill with great energy, and\r\non the 9th of August, 1814, started their first ark-load of coal down\r\nthe river to Philadelphia. Before it had gone eighty rods from the\r\nplace of starting it struck a ledge which tore a hole in the bow of the\r\nboat, “and,” Mr. Miner says, “the lads stripped themselves nearly naked\r\nto stop the rush of water with their clothes.” After many and varied\r\nadventures on the swift currents of the rivers the ark reached its\r\ndestination on the following Sunday morning at eight o’clock, having\r\nbeen five days on the way. Its arrival had been anticipated by its\r\nowners, and they had called public attention to its cargo by means of\r\nhandbills printed in both English and German, and distributed freely\r\nthroughout the city. These handbills, besides advertising the coal,\r\ngave information as to the method of burning it in grates, stoves, and\r\nsmith’s forges. They were also accompanied by printed certificates\r\nfrom blacksmiths and others attesting the value and availability of\r\nthe Lehigh coal as a fuel. The owners of the ark went still farther.\r\nThey put up stoves in conspicuous public places in the city, built\r\ncoal fires in them, and invited the people to stop and inspect them.\r\nThey went to private houses and prevailed on the inmates to be allowed\r\nto kindle anthracite fires in the grates which had been built for the\r\nuse of Liverpool coals. They attended at blacksmith’s shops, and even\r\nbribed the journeymen to give their coals a fair trial in the forge.\r\nThus, by persistent and industrious, nay by presumptuous, efforts,\r\nthese men succeeded in awakening public interest in their enterprise,\r\nand in creating a demand for their wares. The proprietors of the Lehigh\r\ncoals gave particular attention also to the instruction of the people\r\nin the matter of igniting the new fuel. Having once disabused them\r\nof the idea that a strong artificial air current was necessary, the\r\nnext step was to prevent them from disturbing the coals constantly by\r\npoking, punching, and raking them, a proceeding which the uninitiated\r\nseemed to consider of prime importance, in order to induce them to\r\nignite. And, strange as it may seem, this fallacy was the hardest to\r\novercome. Among the purchasers of the Lehigh coals in 1814 was the\r\nfirm of White & Hazard, manufacturers of iron wire at the falls of the\r\nSchuylkill. They had been told by Mr. Joshua Malin, proprietor of a\r\nrolling mill, that he had succeeded in using the new fuel, and as the\r\nVirginia coal was very scarce at that time, White & Hazard decided to\r\ntest the qualities of the anthracite. They purchased a cart-load of\r\nit, paying a dollar a bushel for it, and took it to their works. Here\r\nthey tried to build a fire with it in their furnace, giving it what\r\nthey considered the most skillful manipulation and the most assiduous\r\nattention. Their efforts were in vain. The entire cart-load was wasted\r\nin a futile attempt to make the coals burn. Nothing daunted, they\r\nobtained another cartload, and determined to spend the night, if need\r\nshould be, in the work of building a coal fire. And they did spend\r\nthe night. But when morning came they were apparently as far from\r\nthe attainment of their object as ever. They had poked and punched\r\nand raked; they had labored incessantly; but notwithstanding the\r\nmost constant manipulation, the coals above the burning wood would\r\nnot sufficiently ignite. By this time the men were disheartened and\r\ndisgusted, and slamming the door of the furnace, they left the mill in\r\ndespair, and went to breakfast. It happened that one of them had left\r\nhis jacket in the furnace room, and returning for it about half an\r\nhour later, he discovered that the furnace door was red-hot. In great\r\nsurprise he flung the door open and found the interior glowing with\r\nintense white heat. The other hands were immediately summoned, and four\r\nseparate parcels of iron were heated and rolled by the same fire before\r\nit required renewing. Seeking for the cause of this unexpected result\r\nthe men came to the conclusion that it was due to simply letting the\r\nfire alone, a theory the correctness of which they afterward abundantly\r\nproved. Thus, by chance, these men hit upon the secret of success in\r\nthe matter of building a fire of anthracite coals. That secret is\r\nsimply to throw the coals loosely on the burning wood, and then _let\r\nthem alone_. The incident at White & Hazard’s mills becoming generally\r\nknown, people learned more from it about the process of building a coal\r\nfire than they had learned from all their previous instruction.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the enterprise of the Lehigh operators was still not\r\ndestined to meet with success. They had embarked in the coal trade in\r\n1814, while the war with Great Britain was still in progress, when it\r\nwas impossible to procure coal from England, and when coal from the\r\nRichmond district was very scarce. They were therefore able to obtain\r\nfourteen dollars per ton for the Lehigh coal, but even at this price\r\nthe cost and risk of mining and shipping was so great that the business\r\nwas barely a paying one. In 1815, however, peace was concluded with\r\nGreat Britain, the market was again opened to the reception of foreign\r\ncoals, and the Lehigh operators, being unable to compete with the\r\nsellers of soft coal, were obliged to abandon the field.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the efforts and energy of these proprietors the Summit\r\nHill mining industry did not pay, and in 1817 the mines passed into\r\nthe hands of Josiah White and Erskine Hazard. They perfected a system\r\nof slack-water navigation on the Lehigh, and in 1820 made their first\r\nshipment of 365 tons. The tables commonly printed showing the growth\r\nof the anthracite coal trade usually make that trade begin with this\r\nshipment of Lehigh coal in 1820. This, however, is not quite correct,\r\nas we have seen that coal was sent to market from the Wyoming region\r\nat a much earlier date. It is remarkable that, whereas in 1820 the 365\r\ntons of Lehigh coal stocked the market, in 1831, the year in which the\r\nsystem of slack water navigation was superseded by shipment on the\r\nDelaware division of the Pennsylvania Canal, this region sent down\r\n40,966 tons. And in 1887 there was sent to market from the Lehigh\r\ndistrict a total of 4,347,061 tons, an amount which would have been\r\nmuch greater had not a prolonged strike of coal miners seriously\r\ninterfered with the output.\r\n\r\nIn the Schuylkill region of the Southern coal field similar obstacles\r\nto the introduction of coal were encountered. Nicholas Allen, the\r\ndiscoverer of coal in that region, had formed a partnership with\r\nColonel George Shoemaker, and the firm had purchased a tract of coal\r\nland near Pottsville, on which they began mining operations in the year\r\n1812. They raised several wagon loads of coal, and offered it for sale\r\nin the vicinity, but with the exception of a few blacksmiths, who had\r\nbeen taught its value as a fuel by Colonel Shoemaker, no one could\r\nbe found to purchase it. Allen soon became disheartened and sold his\r\nentire interest in the property to his partner, who, still persisting\r\nin the enterprise, mined a considerable quantity of the coal, filled\r\nten wagons with it, and took it to Philadelphia in quest of a market.\r\nBut it did not meet with a ready sale. People looked at the coals\r\ncuriously, considered them to be nothing more than black stones, and,\r\nseeing no reason why they should burn better than stones of any other\r\ncolor, would not buy them.\r\n\r\nColonel Shoemaker sounded the praises of his wares so vigorously and\r\npersistently, however, that at last a few purchasers were induced to\r\ntake them in small quantities, just for trial. The trials, as usual,\r\nproved to be unsuccessful, and the people who had purchased the coals,\r\nbelieving they had been victimized, denounced Colonel Shoemaker as a\r\ncheat and a swindler; while one person, whose wrath rose to a high\r\npitch, procured a warrant for the colonel’s arrest, on the charge that\r\nhe was a common impostor. At this stage of the proceedings, Colonel\r\nShoemaker, believing discretion to be the better part of valor, quietly\r\nleft the city and started toward his home by a circuitous route,\r\ndriving, it is said, some thirty miles out of his way, in order to\r\navoid the officer of the law holding the warrant for his arrest.\r\n\r\nThis was indeed a discouraging beginning for the Schuylkill coal\r\ntrade. Fortunately, however, not all of the colonel’s customers at\r\nPhiladelphia had met with failure in the effort to burn his coal.\r\nMessrs. Mellen & Bishop, a firm of iron factors in Delaware County,\r\nat the earnest solicitation of Colonel Shoemaker, made the experiment\r\nwith the small quantity of coals purchased by them, and finding that\r\nthe fuel burned successfully they announced that fact through the\r\nPhiladelphia newspapers. Other iron workers were thus induced to try\r\nthe coal, and finally all the furnaces along the Schuylkill had open\r\ndoors for it. Eventually it came into use for the purpose of generating\r\nsteam, the experiments of John Price Wetherill in that direction having\r\nbeen only partially satisfactory, but those at the Phœnixville iron\r\nworks in 1825 meeting with complete success.\r\n\r\nStill the prices which coal commanded in the Philadelphia market\r\nwere not sufficient to pay for the labor of mining it and the cost\r\nof shipping it. So that, prior to 1818, nearly all the coal mined in\r\nthe Schuylkill region was sold to the blacksmiths of the surrounding\r\ncountry. In that year, however, the improvements of the Schuylkill\r\nnavigation were completed, and afforded an additional, though not by\r\nany means safe or sufficient, outlet for the products of the mines. By\r\n1826 and 1827 the growing importance of the coal trade became manifest,\r\nthe Schuylkill navigation system was placed in excellent repair,\r\nand the mining business of the district grew rapidly to enormous\r\nproportions.\r\n\r\nThe northeasterly extension of the Wyoming coal basin, leaving the\r\nSusquehanna River at Pittston, follows the valley of the Lackawanna\r\nup to a point seven miles beyond Carbondale, where it cuts slightly\r\ninto the counties of Wayne and Susquehanna, and there runs out. This\r\nextension is known as the Lackawanna region. Coal was dug up and\r\nexperimented with here at the beginning of the present century. Its\r\noutcrop at the river bank was noted by Preston, a surveyor, in 1804.\r\nIn 1812 it was mined at Providence and burned in a rude grate by H.\r\nC. L. Von Storch. About this time the brothers William and Maurice\r\nWurts, having been attracted by the mineral wealth of the region, came\r\nthere from Philadelphia and began explorations for the purpose of\r\nascertaining the location, area, and quality of the beds of anthracite\r\ncoal. William, the younger brother, in the course of his wanderings\r\nthrough the rugged hills and thick forests of the country, chanced to\r\nmeet a hunter by the name of David Nobles, who, having fled from the\r\nadjoining county of Wayne to avoid imprisonment for debt, was leading a\r\nprecarious existence in the woods. Nobles was well acquainted with the\r\ncountry, knew where the outcroppings of coal were, and having entered\r\ninto the service of Wurts, rendered him most valuable assistance.\r\n\r\nTheir investigations having proved the presence of large bodies of\r\ncoal, the Wurts brothers next procured title to the lands containing\r\nit, and then turned their attention to the problem of finding an\r\noutlet to market. They decided finally to ship coal on rafts by the\r\nWallenpaupack Creek to the Lackawaxen, by the Lackawaxen to the\r\nDelaware, and thence to Philadelphia. This method was experimented\r\non from 1814 to 1822 with varying degrees of disaster. In the year\r\nlast mentioned they succeeded in taking to Philadelphia 100 tons of\r\ncoal, only to find the market flooded with 2,240 tons of Lehigh coal.\r\nCompetition was apparently hopeless; but instead of abandoning the\r\nenterprise, as men of less energy and perseverance would now have done,\r\nMaurice Wurts turned his attention to a new project. This was nothing\r\nless than to make an outlet to the New York market by building a canal\r\nwhich should reach from the Hudson River at Rondout, across to the\r\nDelaware at Port Jervis, and thence up that stream and the Lackawaxen\r\nto the nearest practicable point east of the coal beds. But when that\r\npoint should be reached there would still be the Moosic Mountain,\r\nwith its towering heights and precipitous bluffs, lying between the\r\nboats and the mines. The Wurts brothers did not acknowledge this to\r\nbe a serious obstacle. They proposed to overcome this difficulty by\r\nbuilding across the mountains a railroad, which should consist largely\r\nof inclined planes, the cars to be drawn up and let down these planes\r\nby means of stationary steam-engines, and to move along the stretches\r\nbetween the planes by force of gravity. Having formed their plans they\r\nset to work to carry them out. They procured the necessary legislation\r\nfrom the States of New York and Pennsylvania, they secured a charter\r\nin 1823–25 for a corporation known as the Delaware and Hudson Canal\r\nCompany, and by dint of supreme personal effort they succeeded in\r\nobtaining capital enough to begin and carry on the work. In 1828 the\r\ncanal was completed to its terminus at Honesdale, the gravity railroad\r\nhaving been already constructed from the coal fields to that point,\r\nand in 1829 the company began to ship coal to tide-water on the\r\nHudson. It was a bold and ingenious scheme, and for those days it was\r\nan enterprise of immense proportions. That these two men conceived\r\nit and earned it out in the face of great difficulties and against\r\noverwhelming odds entitles them to a place in those higher orders of\r\ngenius that are touched with the light of the heroic. The Lackawanna\r\nregion has been pierced by many other lines of railway, and to-day by\r\nthese great highways a vast amount of Lackawanna coal is sent to the\r\neastern cities and the seaboard.\r\n\r\nBut as a rule, men who invested their money in coal lands in the early\r\ndays after the discovery of coal lost the amount of the investment.\r\nThey, with prophetic vision, saw the comfort, the commerce, the\r\nmanufactures, of a nation dependent on the products of the coal mines,\r\nbut the people at large could not see so far. These pioneers made\r\nready to supply an anticipated demand, but it did not come. Talking\r\ndid not bring it. Exhibitions of the wonderful utility of the black\r\ncoals served to arouse but a passing interest. No other product of the\r\nglobe which has obtained a position of equal importance ever had to\r\nfight its way into public favor with such persistent effort through so\r\nmany years. But when at last its worth became generally recognized,\r\nwhen the people had reached the conclusion that they wanted it, and\r\nits value in dollars had become fixed and permanent, then the pioneers\r\nof the industry had vanished from the field; they were disheartened,\r\ndestitute, or dead; new hands and brains took up the work, matured\r\nthe plans of the elders, and reaped the fortunes of which former\r\ngenerations had sown the seed.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning the coal lands were mostly divided into small\r\ntracts, and held by persons many of whom thought to open mines on\r\ntheir property and carry on the business of mining as an individual\r\nenterprise. This plan of work was partially successful so long as\r\ncoal could be dug from the outcrop and carted away like stones from\r\na quarry; but when it became necessary, as it soon did, to penetrate\r\nmore deeply into the earth for the article of trade, then the cost\r\nof shafting, tunneling, and mining in general usually exceeded the\r\nresources of the individual operator, and either he succumbed to\r\nfinancial distress, or disposed of his mining interests to men or firms\r\nwith more money. As the art of mining advanced with its necessities,\r\nit was learned, sometimes after bitter experience, that the business\r\nwas profitable only when a large amount of capital was behind it.\r\nTherefore men who had invested a few thousand dollars transferred\r\ntheir interests to men who had a few hundred thousand to invest, and\r\nthese, in turn, associating other capitalists with them, doubled or\r\ntrebled the investment or ran it into the millions, forming companies\r\nor corporations to accomplish with their more perfect organization\r\nthat which would be impossible to the individual. So it has come about\r\nthat in these later days the individual operators have given place\r\nlargely to the corporations; those who still remain in the field often\r\noperating their mines on a small capital at great disadvantage. In the\r\nbituminous regions, however, this rule does not hold good. There the\r\ncoal lies near the surface, is accessible, and easily mined. It needs\r\nonly to be carried to the river bank and screened as it is loaded into\r\nboats and started on its way to market. Compared with the anthracite\r\nregions, it requires but a small capital here to sustain an extensive\r\nplant, and produce a large quantity of coal. Therefore we find, as we\r\nshould expect to find, that in the bituminous districts the bulk of\r\nthe coal is produced by individuals, firms, and small companies. In the\r\nanthracite regions, however, this rule is reversed. Of the 36,204,000\r\ntons of anthracite produced in the year 1887, 16,109,387 tons, or\r\nnearly one half, were mined by five great companies; namely: The\r\nPhiladelphia and Reading; Delaware and Hudson; Delaware, Lackawanna,\r\nand Western; Lehigh Valley; and Pennsylvania Coal Company. The immense\r\nout-put of as many more large corporations left but a very small\r\nproportion of the total product to the small companies, firms, and\r\nindividuals.\r\n\r\nIt follows, as a matter of course, that the acreage of coal lands held\r\nby these companies bears the same proportion to the total acreage that\r\ntheir coal out-put bears to the entire coal out-put. That is, they\r\neither own or hold under lease the great bulk of the coal beds of the\r\nanthracite regions. The value of coal lands varies with the number,\r\nthickness, and accessibility of the coal seams contained in it. In the\r\nvery early days of anthracite mining these lands were purchased from\r\nfarmers and others at from twenty and thirty dollars to one hundred\r\ndollars per acre. Before 1850 the price had advanced, in the Wyoming\r\nregion, to from seventy-five dollars to two hundred dollars per acre.\r\nRecently a piece of coal land was sold in this region for $1,200 per\r\nacre, and another piece, containing thirty-six acres, was sold at the\r\nrate of $1,500 per acre. Perhaps from $800 to $1,000 per acre might\r\nbe considered an average price. In the Middle and Southern anthracite\r\nregions the coal lands are of still greater value; not because the\r\nquality of the mineral is better, nor because the market for it is more\r\naccessible, but because the coal seams dip at a greater angle, and,\r\ntherefore, a given number of acres contains a larger amount of coal.\r\n\r\nThe system of leasing coal lands to coal operators is a very common\r\none, especially in the Wyoming valley, where the surface is so richly\r\nadapted to agricultural uses. The proprietor can, in this way, retain\r\nthe use of the soil, and at the same time reap a handsome profit from\r\nthe development of the mineral deposits beneath it. He invests no\r\ncapital, runs no risk, and is sure of a steady income. As it is usual\r\nto work leased coal seams, wherever convenient, from openings made on\r\nthe adjoining lands owned by the company, it is not often that the\r\nsurface of leased property is interfered with, or if it is, but a\r\ncomparatively small area of it is taken. The contract of lease usually\r\nstipulates that a certain royalty shall be paid to the lessor for each\r\nton of coal mined, and it binds the lessee to mine not less than a\r\ncertain number of tons each year; or at least to pay royalties on not\r\nless than a certain number of tons each year, whether that number is\r\nor is not mined. Twenty years or more ago coal lands in the Wyoming\r\ndistrict could be leased at the rate of ten cents per ton. Lately a\r\nlarge body of coal land was rented to the Lehigh Valley Coal Company\r\nat forty-five cents per ton, and it is said that one proprietor at\r\nKingston has been offered a lease at fifty cents per ton, and has\r\nrefused it. Perhaps from twenty-five cents to thirty-five cents per ton\r\nwould be an average rate.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the immense purchases made by these companies, it may\r\nbe noted that the Philadelphia and Reading Company, in 1871, purchased\r\none hundred thousand acres of coal lands in the Schuylkill region, at\r\na cost of forty millions of dollars. And as an example of the amount\r\nof business done in a year, it may be noted that the Delaware and\r\nHudson Canal Company paid in 1887 $5,019,147.16 for the single item of\r\nmining coal, and that their coal sales for the same year amounted to\r\n$10,100,118.69.\r\n\r\nThis concentration of coal lands and coal mining in the hands of great\r\ncorporations, aside from its tendency to stifle healthy competition,\r\nis productive of many benefits. Coal can be mined much cheaper when\r\nthe mining is done on a large scale. This is the rule, indeed, in\r\nall productive industries. An enterprise backed by the combined\r\ncapital of many individuals is more certain to become successful and\r\npermanent than an enterprise inaugurated by, and carried on with,\r\nthe entire capital of a single individual. Especially is this the\r\nrule in a business attended with as much risk as is the business of\r\ncoal mining. One person may put his entire fortune of two or three\r\nhundred thousand dollars into a single colliery. A depression in\r\nthe coal trade, a strike among the miners, an explosion, or a fire\r\nwould be very apt to bring financial ruin on him. A company, with its\r\ngreat resources and its elastic character, can meet and recover from\r\nan adverse incident of this kind with scarcely a perceptible shock\r\nto its business. It is simply one of the items of loss which it is\r\nprepared to cover with a larger item of profit. There is also the\r\nadditional assurance that all work that is done will be well done. The\r\nmost careful observations and calculations are made of the amount and\r\nquality of included coal in any tract of land before it is purchased,\r\nand the best surveyors are employed to mark out the boundary lines of\r\nlands. The services of the most skillful mining engineers are retained,\r\nat salaries which no individual operator could afford to pay. Their\r\nforces are well organized, their mining operations are conducted with\r\nsystem and economy, and they are able to keep abreast of the age in\r\nall inventions and appliances that insure greater facility in mining\r\nand manufacturing, and greater safety to the workmen. Their employees\r\nare paid promptly at stated periods, and the possibility of a workman\r\nlosing his wages by reason of neglect or failure on the part of his\r\nemployer is reduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\nIn general, it may be said that the control of the anthracite coal\r\nbusiness by the great corporations, rather than by individual operators,\r\nis an undoubted benefit, not only to all the parties in direct interest,\r\nbut to commerce and society as a whole. The only danger to be feared is\r\nfrom an abuse of the great powers to which these companies have\r\nattained; a danger which, thus far, has not seriously menaced the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nTHE WAY INTO THE MINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA wise coal operator never begins to open a mine for the purpose of\r\ntaking out coal until he knows the character of the bed and the quality\r\nof the mineral. This knowledge can only be obtained by an exhaustive\r\nsearch for, and a careful examination of, all surface indications,\r\nand by drilling or boring holes down to and through the strata of\r\ncoal. This is called “prospecting.” The examiner in a new field will\r\nfirst look for outcrops. He will follow up the valleys and inspect\r\nthe ledges and the banks of streams. If he be so fortunate as to find\r\nan exposure of the coal seams, or of any one of them, he will measure\r\nits thickness, will calculate its dip and strike, and will follow its\r\noutcrop. He will also study and make careful note of the rock strata\r\nwith which it is associated, for by this means he may be able to\r\ndetermine the probability of other seams lying above or below it. This\r\nexamination of the rock strata he will make, whether coal is visible\r\nor not visible. It will be of much service to him. For instance, it is\r\nknown that the great Baltimore vein in the Wyoming valley is usually\r\noverlaid by a coarse red sandstone. If the examiner finds rock of this\r\ncharacter in that section, he has good reason to hope that coal lies\r\nbeneath it. Under the lowest coal seam of the anthracite beds there\r\nis found, as a rule, a rock known as the conglomerate. If, therefore,\r\nthe explorer finds an outcrop of conglomerate, he will know that, as\r\na rule, he need not look for coal beyond it. This rock, coming to the\r\nsurface on the westerly side of the Moosic range of mountains, marks\r\nthe limit of the Lackawanna coal field toward the east. No one, having\r\nonce studied the conglomerate rock, could mistake it for any other,\r\nthough its composition is very simple. It is nothing more than white,\r\nwater-worn quartz pebbles, held together by a firm, lead-colored\r\ncement. But it is a rock of unusual hardness and durability. It is\r\nproof against the erosive action of water, grows harder by exposure\r\nto the air, and has a consistency that approximates to that of iron.\r\nIn the coal districts it is used largely for building purposes, where\r\nheavy walls and foundations are required. Experience has taught that\r\nthere are no coal seams below the conglomerate, so that wherever this\r\nis found as a surface rock, or wherever it is pierced by the drill,\r\nit is usually unnecessary to explore below it. If no coal outcrop is\r\nfound, the bed of a stream is searched for fragments of the mineral,\r\nand, if any are discovered, they are traced to their source. Coal is\r\nsometimes exposed where a tree has been uprooted by the wind, and\r\npieces of it have been found in the soil thrown out at a groundhog’s\r\nburrow.\r\n\r\nWagon roads crossing the country may be scanned for traces of the\r\n“smut” or “blossom.” This is the decomposed outcrop, which has become\r\nmingled with the soil, and may be more readily distinguished in the\r\nbed of a traveled road than elsewhere. Other surface indications\r\nfailing, the topographical features of this section of country should\r\nbe studied. Wherever the coal seams come to the surface, being softer\r\nthan the rock strata above and below them, they are disintegrated and\r\neroded more rapidly by the action of the atmosphere and the elements.\r\nThis wearing away of the exposed coal leaves the surface outline in\r\nthe form of a bench or terrace, which follows the line of the outcrop.\r\nAnd this form is retained even with a thick deposit of soil over the\r\nedges of the strata. Small shafts may be sunk or tunnels driven through\r\nthis thickness of earth, and the outcrop explored in this way. This\r\nprocess of examination is of more value in the bituminous than in the\r\nanthracite regions, since the bituminous coal, being soft, is more\r\nrapidly eroded, and the terrace formation resulting from such erosion\r\nis more distinct and certain. In these days, in the anthracite coal\r\nfields, there is hardly an area of any great extent in which mines have\r\nnot been actually opened. These mines, therefore, in the facilities\r\nthey afford for studying exposed strata and developed coal seams,\r\noffer the best means of acquiring knowledge concerning the coal beds\r\nof adjoining tracts. In a country where no surface indications of coal\r\nare found over a large area, it is hardly worth while to explore for it\r\nby boring. In the anthracite regions of Pennsylvania the limits of the\r\ncoal beds are now so accurately defined that it is seldom necessary to\r\nbore for the purpose of testing the presence of coal. But it is always\r\nadvisable, before opening a mine in a new field, to test the depth,\r\ndip, and quality of the coal and the character of the seams by sinking\r\none or more bore holes. Surface measurements of a seam are, at best,\r\nvery uncertain, as indications of its continuing character. The angle\r\nof dip may change radically before a depth of one hundred feet shall be\r\nreached. And coal undergoes so great deterioration by long exposure to\r\nthe atmosphere that, in order to judge the quality of a coal bed, it is\r\nnecessary to have a specimen fragment from it that has been hidden away\r\nin the rocks. Hence the necessity of boring.\r\n\r\nHand drills were generally used in the early days of prospecting, and\r\na sand pump drew out the sludge or borings for examination. This was\r\nsuperseded by the spring pole method, which in turn gave way to the\r\nrope method in use in the oil regions, the borings in each case being\r\ncarefully preserved for inspection. The diamond drill is the one now\r\nin common use in the coal regions. Its cutting end is in the form of a\r\ncircle set with black, amorphous diamonds. It cuts an annular groove in\r\nthe rock as it descends, forming a core, which is withdrawn with the\r\ndrill, and which may be examined in vertical section. The sludge is\r\nwashed out by a stream of water which passes down through the centre of\r\nthe drill rod, and is forced back to the surface between the rod and\r\nthe face of the bore hole. The invention of this rotary cutting drill\r\nis due to Leschot of Geneva, and the method of flushing the hole to\r\nFlauvelle.\r\n\r\nAfter having obtained all possible information concerning his coal\r\nproperty, and, if he be wise, embodying it in the form of maps, the\r\ncoal operator must decide where he shall make an opening for mining\r\npurposes, and what kind of an opening he shall make. The answers to\r\nthese two questions are, to a certain extent, dependent on each other,\r\nas certain kinds of openings must be located at certain places. When\r\ncoal was first gathered for experiment or observation, it was taken\r\nup loosely from the ground, where it had fallen or been broken down\r\nfrom the outcrop of some seam. As it came into demand for practical\r\npurposes, it was quarried from this outcrop backward and downward, as\r\nstones for building purposes are now quarried, the seam being uncovered\r\nas the work proceeded. This process was followed along the line of the\r\noutcrop, but excavations were not made to any considerable depth, owing\r\nto the great expense of uncovering the coal.\r\n\r\nThe open quarry system of mining coal has been successfully practiced\r\nin America in but a few places. One of these was the great Summit\r\nHill open mine, near Mauch Chunk, where the Lehigh coal was first\r\ndiscovered. Here, on a hill-top, was a horizontal coal bed, some\r\nsixty acres in extent, and varying in thickness from fifteen to fifty\r\nfeet. Over this was a covering of rock, slate, and earth from three\r\nto fifteen feet in thickness. This bed was mined by simply removing\r\nthe covering and taking the coal out as from a quarry. Other examples\r\nof this method are seen at Hollywood Colliery, and at Hazleton No. 6\r\nColliery, both near Hazleton, in Luzerne County. There are isolated\r\ninstances of this method of stripping elsewhere in the anthracite\r\nregions, but as a rule the conditions are not favorable for it.\r\nOrdinarily there are four methods of making an entrance into a mine\r\nfor the purpose of taking out coal. These are known as the drift, the\r\ntunnel, the slope, and the shaft.\r\n\r\nTo the early miners the drift was the favorite mode of entry. Finding\r\nan exposed seam of coal in the face of a ledge or cliff, they would\r\ndig in on it and bring the coal out from the opening in wheelbarrows.\r\nA place was selected, if possible, where a creek or river ran at\r\nthe base of the ledge, and the coal was dumped from the wheelbarrow\r\ndirectly into a boat. In default of a water way a wagon road was built\r\nat the foot of the hill or cliff, a platform extended out over it, and\r\nthe coal was thus loaded from the wheelbarrow into the wagon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSS SECTION OF DRIFT OR GANGWAY WITH TIMBERS AND\r\nLAGGING.]\r\n\r\nThe modern drift, though fashioned on an improved plan, is the simplest\r\nand least expensive way of making an entrance into a coal mine. The\r\noutline of the proposed opening is first marked out on the edge of the\r\nexposed coal seam. From fifteen to eighteen feet is an ordinary width\r\nto accommodate two tracks, and ten feet will readily accommodate one.\r\nSeven feet is an average height, though, if the seam be comparatively\r\nflat, the coal will be taken down until the rock is reached, even\r\nthough a greater height should be attained. With this width and height\r\nthe opening is cut into the hill through the coal seam. The floor of\r\nthe drift must have a constant upward grade as it progresses inward, in\r\norder that the water may run out, and that loaded cars may be hauled\r\nmore easily. The mouth of the drift must be above the level of the\r\nadjacent valley or stream, so that the water may be carried away, and\r\nthe drift is therefore what is known as a water-level opening. It is\r\nusually necessary to support the roof and sides of the drift by timbers\r\njoined together in the form of a bent, and placed more or less closely\r\nto each other. These timbers are also sometimes lined by sticks placed\r\nbehind and over them horizontally, and known as “lagging.” It will be\r\nseen that the conditions under which the opening by drift may be made\r\nplace a serious limitation on the use of this method. It will also\r\nnow be seen why the drift is the simplest and most economical mode of\r\nmaking an entrance to a mine. In this method there is no expense for\r\nremoving earth or for cutting through rock, nor any cost at any time of\r\npumping water or of hoisting coal. When the fact is remembered that it\r\nsometimes costs from $50,000 to $100,000 to sink a deep shaft through\r\nhard rock, and that to this amount must be added the cost of buildings,\r\nmachinery, and repairs, and the perpetual cost of pumping water and of\r\nhoisting coal, the economy of the drift method will be appreciated. But\r\nthe day of drift mining in the anthracite regions has gone by. Those\r\nportions of the coal beds lying above water level have been largely\r\nmined out, and the areas of coal that are now accessible by drift are\r\nvery limited. In the bituminous districts, however, where the seams lie\r\ncomparatively flat and the coal is mostly above water level, the method\r\nby drift is still almost universally used.\r\n\r\nNext to a drift, the tunnel is the simplest and most economical method,\r\nunder certain circumstances, of making an entrance into a mine. This\r\nis a passage driven across the measures, and at right angles to the\r\nseam, in order to reach coal which at the point of opening is not\r\nexposed. The tunnel is usually driven into the side of a hill. The\r\nearth is first dug away until the rock is exposed, or, if the soil be\r\ntoo deep for that, only enough of it is taken to make a vertical face\r\nfor the mouth of the tunnel. The opening is then driven into the hill\r\nat about the same width and height that a drift would be made, and in\r\npractically the same manner. If there is a section of earth tunneling\r\nat the mouth, the timbering must be close, and the lagging will be of\r\nheavy planks. When the solid rock is reached, however, it is not often\r\nthat any timbering is necessary, the sides and roof being so hard and\r\nfirm as not to need support. This passage is driven against the face\r\nof a coal seam, and when the coal is finally reached the tunnel proper\r\nends, a passage is opened to the right and one to the left along the\r\nstrike of the seam, and from these gangways the coal is mined. The\r\ntunnel, like the drift, must be above water level, and its floor must\r\nhave a descending grade toward the mouth, to carry off water. The\r\nexpense of the tunnel, and its superiority to the slope or shaft, will\r\ndepend upon the distance through which the rock must be pierced before\r\ncoal is reached. It is especially advisable, therefore, before opening\r\na tunnel, to have an accurate map of the location and dip of the coal\r\nseams to be struck by it, otherwise no approximate calculation can be\r\nmade of the extent or cost of the work.\r\n\r\nIn the anthracite districts, where the seams are sharply pitching,\r\ntunnels are driven in the interior of a mine from the workings of\r\na seam already opened across the intervening measures to strike an\r\nadjacent seam. In this way two, three, or more coal seams can be\r\nworked, and the coal can all be brought out at one surface opening.\r\nThis is virtually the only kind of tunneling that is now done in the\r\nanthracite regions; for, as has already been explained, the coal that\r\nlay above water level and was thus accessible by tunnel has now been\r\nmostly mined out.\r\n\r\nIf there is an outcrop of coal on the tract to be mined, and the dip\r\nof the seam is more than twenty degrees, it is usually advisable to\r\nenter the mine by means of a slope. This is a passage which, beginning\r\nat the outcrop, follows the coal seam down until the necessary depth\r\nis reached. It is driven in the coal. The distinction between the\r\ndrift and the slope is that the drift is driven from the surface on\r\nthe strike of the seam while the slope is driven on its dip. Where\r\nthe coal seam comes within a moderate distance of the surface, as at\r\nan anticlinal ridge, a slope may be driven through the rock until the\r\ncoal is reached at the axis, and from that point follow the seam down.\r\nSometimes a shaft is sunk to the top of an anticlinal ridge, and from\r\nits foot two slopes are driven, one down each side of the roll, in\r\nopposite directions. If the seam is very irregular, or if it is much\r\nbroken by faults, there may be a great deal of rock cutting to be done\r\nin order to preserve the uniformity of grade necessary for the slope.\r\nThe cost may, indeed, in this case, amount to more than would have been\r\nsufficient to sink a shaft to the same depth, although, as a rule, the\r\nentrance by slope should cost only about one fourth of that by shaft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CROSS SECTION OF SLOPE WITH DOUBLE TRACK.]\r\n\r\nThe same methods are employed in sinking a slope as are used in driving\r\na drift, except that generally the timbering need not be so heavy. The\r\nminimum height of the slope is about 6½ feet, the width at the top, or\r\ncollar, about 8 feet, and the width at the bottom, or spread, about 12\r\nfeet. If a double track is desired the spread should be 18 feet and\r\nthe collar 14 feet. In the Wyoming region, where the dip is usually\r\nless than twenty degrees, with infrequent outcrops, the slope is not in\r\ngeneral use; but in the Southern coal field, where the dip varies from\r\ntwenty degrees to the vertical, the slope is the most common method of\r\nentering a mine. There the opening is driven down for a distance of 300\r\nfeet, at which point gangways are started out to right and left, along\r\nthe strike, and chambers driven from them back toward the surface. This\r\nis called the first lift. The slope is then continued downward for\r\nanother distance of 300 feet, new gangways and chambers are laid off,\r\nand this is called the second lift. This process is continued until the\r\nsynclinal basin is reached.\r\n\r\nWhere the dip of the slope is less than thirty degrees the coal is\r\nbrought to the surface in the car into which it was first loaded in the\r\nmine. At a greater angle than this the ordinary mine car is superseded\r\nby a car or carriage especially adapted to carrying coal up a steep\r\nincline.\r\n\r\nWhere there is no outcrop in the tract to be mined, and the coal\r\nlies below water level, the best mode of making an entrance to it is\r\nby shaft. In the Wyoming region, since the upper veins have been so\r\ngenerally mined out, nearly all the openings are by shaft. The location\r\nof the shaft at the surface should be such that when it is completed\r\nits foot shall be at the bottom, or nearly at the bottom, of the\r\nsynclinal valley into which it is sunk. As will be more readily seen\r\nhereafter, this is necessary in order to carry the water of the mine\r\nto the foot of the shaft, to facilitate the transportation of coal\r\nunder ground, and to get room to open up the greatest possible working\r\narea. The depth to which a shaft must be sunk depends on the seam to\r\nbe reached, and on the district in which it is located. At Carbondale,\r\nin the northeasterly extremity of the Wyoming basin, the average depth\r\nto the conglomerate or bed of the lowest coal seam is 250 feet. From\r\nScranton to Pittston it is from 500 to 600 feet. At Wilkes Barre it is\r\n1,200 feet. It reaches its greatest average depth a mile northeast of\r\nNanticoke, where it is from 1,500 to 1,600 feet.\r\n\r\nThis will be the limit of depth for shafts in the Wyoming region. At\r\npresent the average depth is from 300 to 400 feet, and there are few\r\nthat are more than 800 feet deep. The red-ash vein to which most of\r\nthe shafts are now being sunk is, at Pittston in the middle of the\r\ngeneral basin, from 450 to 650 feet below the surface. In the southern\r\nanthracite region the average depth of shafts is somewhat greater, the\r\nmaximum depth being reached in the vicinity of Pottsville, where the\r\nPottsville deep shafts are about 1,600 feet in depth.\r\n\r\nIn beginning to open a shaft a rectangular space is staked out on the\r\nground from four to eight feet wider and longer than the proposed\r\ndimensions of the shaft; and the soil and loose stones are thrown out\r\nfrom this larger area until bed rock is reached, which is usually done,\r\nexcept in the river bottom lands, within a depth of twenty feet.\r\n\r\nFrom this rock as a foundation a cribbing of solid timber, twelve\r\ninches square, is built up to the surface on the four sides of the\r\nopening to prevent the earth from caving in. Sometimes heavy walls of\r\nmasonry are built up instead of the timber cribbing, and though the\r\noriginal cost is greater, the purpose is far better answered by the\r\nstone curbing. When this has been completed, sinking through the rock\r\ngoes on by the ordinary process of blasting, plumb lines being hung at\r\nthe corners of the shaft to keep the opening vertical.\r\n\r\nAn act of the Pennsylvania legislature, approved June 30, 1885,\r\nregulates the conduct of coal mining in the State so far as the safety\r\nof persons employed in and about the mines is concerned. Former acts\r\nare consolidated and revised in this, and new provisions are added.\r\nBy virtue of this act both the anthracite and bituminous coal fields\r\nare divided into districts, each of which is placed in charge of\r\nan inspector, whose duty it is to see that the provisions of the\r\nlaw are carried out, and to make annual report to the Secretary of\r\nInternal Affairs of such facts and statistics as the law requires\r\nto be made. As there will be frequent occasion hereafter to refer\r\nto various provisions of this act of assembly, it will be mentioned\r\nsimply as the act of 1885. The matter is brought up here in order\r\nthat the rules relating to the sinking of shafts, as laid down in the\r\nact, may be referred to. These rules provide the manner in which the\r\nnecessary structures at the mouth of the opening shall be erected, what\r\nprecautions shall be taken to prevent material from falling into the\r\npit, how the ascent and descent shall be made, that all blasts during\r\nthe process of sinking shall be exploded by an electric battery, etc.\r\nAll these rules have but one object, the safety of the workmen.\r\n\r\nThe horizontal dimensions of the modern shaft average about twelve feet\r\nin width by thirty feet in length. This space is divided crosswise,\r\ndown the entire depth of the shaft, into compartments of which there\r\nare usually four. The first of these compartments is the pump way, a\r\nspace devoted to the pipes, pump-rod, and other appliances connected\r\nwith the pumping system. To this six feet in breadth is allowed. Then\r\ncome, in succession, the two carriage ways, each of which may be seven\r\nfeet wide, and, finally, the air passage through which the foul air is\r\nexhausted from the mine, and to which ten feet is appropriated. The\r\npartitions between these compartments are made of oak sticks six inches\r\nsquare, called buntons. The ends of the buntons are let into the rock\r\nsides of the shaft, and they are placed horizontally at a vertical\r\ndistance from each other of about four feet. These bunton partitions\r\nare then closely boarded down the entire distance. The partition\r\nbetween the hoisting compartment and the airway is not only boarded up,\r\nbut the boards are matched and are rabbeted together. It is necessary\r\nto make as nearly air-tight as possible this way for the passage of\r\nair, and where the edges of the boarding meet the rock sides of the\r\nshaft the irregularities are carefully filled in with brick and mortar.\r\n\r\nFastened to the buntons at each side of each hoisting compartment\r\nare continuous strips of hard wood, from four to six inches square,\r\nreaching from the top of the shaft to its bottom. These are the\r\n“guides.” To each side of the carriage, which raises and lowers men and\r\nmaterials, is fastened an iron shoe, shaped like a small rectangular\r\nbox without top or ends. This shoe fits loosely on to the guide,\r\nslides up and down it, and serves to keep the carriage steady while\r\nit is ascending or descending. This invention is due to John Curr of\r\nSheffield, England, who introduced it as early as 1798. The ordinary\r\ncarriage consists of a wooden platform with vertical posts at the\r\nmiddle of the sides united by a cross-beam at the top, and all solidly\r\nbuilt and thoroughly braced. The posts are just inside of the guides\r\nwhen the carriage is in place, and are kept parallel to them by the\r\nshoes already mentioned. To the middle of the cross-beam is attached\r\nthe end of a wire cable, from which the carriage is suspended, and by\r\nwhich it is raised and lowered. On the floor of the platform, which\r\nis planked over, a track is built uniform with the track at the foot\r\nand head of the shaft, and continuous with it when the carriage is at\r\nrest at either place. The mine car is pushed on to the platform of the\r\ncarriage and fastened there by a device which clings to the axle or\r\nblocks the wheels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VERTICAL SECTION AT FOOT OF SHAFT, WITH ASCENDING\r\nCARRIAGE.]\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of the shaft and projecting into it are the “wings,”\r\n“keeps,” or “cage rests,” which are pressed against the sides of the\r\nshaft by the ascending carriage, but spring back into place underneath\r\nit and support it while it is at rest. When the carriage is ready to\r\ndescend the wings are withdrawn by hand levers.\r\n\r\nThe safety carriage is now in general use in at least one hoisting\r\ncompartment of every shaft. This carriage is built of wrought iron\r\ninstead of wood; it has a bonnet or roof as a protection against\r\nobjects falling down the shaft, and it has safety clutches or dogs to\r\nstop the carriage and hold it in place in case of accident by breaking\r\nropes or machinery. Operators are required by the act of 1885 to\r\nprovide safety carriages for the use of their employees, and also to\r\nkeep movable gates or covers at the mouth of each shaft to prevent\r\npersons and materials from falling into the opening.\r\n\r\nWhere mining is done by shaft there is seldom any other way provided\r\nfor the passage of workmen in and out than the way by the carriage.\r\nA small shaft for the admission of air is sometimes driven down to\r\nthe highest part of the seam, and ladders are placed in the opening\r\non which men may climb up and down, but these ladders are seldom used\r\nsave in an emergency. It is made obligatory upon operators, by the act\r\nof 1885, to provide two openings to every seam of coal that is being\r\nworked; these openings to be at least sixty feet apart underground,\r\nand one hundred and fifty feet apart at the surface. The object of this\r\nrule is to provide a way of escape for workmen in case of accident to\r\nthe main outlet.\r\n\r\nIt is seldom necessary, however, in these days, to sink a separate shaft\r\nin order to comply with this provision of the law; the underground\r\nworkings of the mines having such extensive connections that often not\r\nonly two but many openings are accessible from each seam.\r\n\r\nAs to the comparative cost of the different methods of entry, the drift\r\nis of course the cheapest. In this method the very first blow of the\r\npick brings down a fragment of coal that may be sent to market and\r\nsold. For this reason the sinking of a slope is less expensive than\r\ntunneling or shafting, because the excavation is made in the coal. It\r\nmay be said to cost from twenty-five to fifty dollars per linear yard\r\nto sink an ordinary double track slope, from fifty to seventy-five\r\ndollars per linear yard to drive a tunnel of average cross-section to\r\naccommodate two tracks, and from three hundred to five hundred dollars\r\nper linear yard to sink a shaft with four compartments. Of course\r\ncircumstances, especially the character of strata, may greatly increase\r\nor lessen these limits of cost. Indeed, it has happened that a shaft in\r\nprocess of sinking, which had already cost many thousands of dollars,\r\nhas been necessarily abandoned because an intractable bed of quicksand\r\nhas been encountered.\r\n\r\nThe experienced coal operator, knowing the advantages and disadvantages\r\nof each of these methods of entering a mine, and the adaptability of\r\neach to his particular coal bed, will find no difficulty in making a\r\nselection from them. Indeed, there may be, and usually is, practically,\r\nno choice. The selection of a site for the opening is ordinarily\r\nattended with but little more freedom of choice. The outcrop, if there\r\nbe one, the topography of the surface, the outline of the coal seam,\r\nthe accessibility of the spot, the location of the breaker, all govern\r\nin the selection of the site, and usually all point to the one most\r\navailable spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nA PLAN OF A COAL MINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe progress that has been made in the science of mining coal within\r\nthe last half century bears favorable comparison with the progress\r\nthat has been made in the other industrial sciences. To-day the ripest\r\nexperience and the best engineering skill in the land are brought\r\nto bear upon the problems connected with coal mining. In comparison\r\nwith the marked ability employed and the marked success attained in\r\nthe mining enterprises of to-day, the efforts of the early miners are\r\nalmost amusing. The pick and the wedge were the chief instruments used\r\nin getting out coal. Powder was not thought to be available until John\r\nFlanigan, a miner for Abijah Smith, introduced it into the mines in\r\n1818. It is said that when openings were first made for coal in the\r\nvicinity of Pottsville shallow shafts were sunk, and the coal was\r\nhoisted in a large vessel by means of a common windlass. As soon as the\r\nwater became troublesome, which was usually as soon as the shaft had\r\nreached a depth of twenty or thirty feet, this opening was abandoned, a\r\nnew shaft sunk, and the process repeated.\r\n\r\nThe mine operator of to-day, having decided upon the shaft as the best\r\nmethod of entry into his mine, sinks it to the bottom of the coal\r\nbed, so that its longest dimension shall be with the dip of the seam.\r\nThen from each side of the shaft, and at right angles to it, he cuts\r\na passage out through the coal with a width of from ten to fourteen\r\nfeet. These are the beginnings of the “gangways.” Then from each end\r\nof the rectangular foot of the shaft he cuts another passage, at right\r\nangles to the first one, about six or eight feet wide, and extending\r\nto a distance of from fifteen to thirty feet. These are the first\r\n“cross-headings.” At the extremities of the cross-headings passages are\r\nnow driven parallel to the gangways. These last passages are called\r\n“airways.” When the gangways and airways have reached a distance of\r\nfrom sixty to one hundred feet from the foot of the shaft they are\r\nunited by new cross-headings.\r\n\r\nIt is now apparent that two pillars of coal, each from fifteen to\r\nthirty feet wide and from sixty to one hundred feet long are left on\r\neach side of the shaft. Larger pillars than these may be left if the\r\nroof about the shaft should need more support. It is also apparent,\r\nthe coal seam being inclined, that the level of one of the airways is\r\nhigher than the level of the gangway, and the level of the other airway\r\nis lower.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that the design was to sink the shaft so that its\r\nfoot should be nearly to the bottom of the synclinal valley or basin.\r\nIf this has been done, then it is possible that the passage below the\r\nfoot of the shaft parallel to the gangway actually runs along the\r\nsynclinal axis. But if the bottom of the valley is still lower, the\r\ncross-headings will be driven farther down and a new parallel passage\r\nmade, and, if necessary, still another. These openings now slope from\r\nthe foot of the shaft downward, and in them is collected not only the\r\nwater that may fall from the shaft, but, as the work advances, all the\r\nwater that comes from all parts of the mine. This basin which is thus\r\nmade to receive the mine water is called the “sump,” and from it the\r\nwater is pumped up through the shaft and discharged at the surface.\r\nIf the mine happens to be a very wet one it will require the constant\r\nlabor of the most powerful pumping engine to keep the level of the\r\nwater in the sump lower than the foot of the shaft. In some cases, in\r\nolder workings, a section of the mine which has been worked out and\r\nabandoned is used for a sump, and then the water may cover an area many\r\nacres in extent. When a shaft has been newly sunk, the openings for\r\nthe sump are the only ones that are made below the level of the foot\r\nof the shaft or below the level of the gangway. Henceforth all the\r\nworkings will be made on the upper side of the gangway, extending up\r\nthe slope of the seam, until such time as it may be deemed advisable to\r\nsink an inside slope to open a new set of workings on a lower level.\r\nThe main gangway on one side of the shaft and the airway above it are\r\nnow carried along simultaneously, and parallel with each other, and\r\nare united at distances of from forty to sixty feet by cross-headings.\r\nAs soon as the last cross-heading is opened the one which immediately\r\npreceded it is walled up as tightly as possible. This is to insure\r\nventilation. A current of air comes down the hoisting-way of the shaft,\r\npasses into the gangway and along it to the last cross-heading, where\r\nit crosses up into the airway and traverses the airway back to the\r\ncross-heading that was driven up from the upper end of the foot of the\r\nshaft. Passing down this cross-heading it comes to the air compartment\r\nof the shaft, and is drawn out to the surface by a powerful fan. This\r\nis the ventilating system of the mine in its simplest form. It is\r\napparent that if any of the cross-headings nearer to the shaft than the\r\nlast one should be left open, the air current would take a short course\r\nthrough it up to the airway, and so back to the shaft, without going to\r\nthe extremity of the gangway at all. This gangway is the main artery of\r\nthe mine; it is the highway by which all the empty cars go in to the\r\nworking faces, and by which all the loaded cars come out to the foot\r\nof the shaft; it is the general watercourse by which the entire mine\r\nabove it is drained, and by which the water is carried to the sump. In\r\ncomparatively flat seams its height is the height of the slate or rock\r\nroof of the coal bed, but in steep pitching seams it is made seven or\r\neight feet high with a roof wholly or partly of coal. In some cases\r\nthe roof and sides are so firm that no timbering is required, and in\r\nother cases the timbering must be close and heavy in order to give\r\nthe necessary support and security. The floor of the gangway must be\r\ngiven a constantly ascending grade, usually from six inches to one foot\r\nin every hundred feet, as it is driven inward. This is to facilitate\r\ndrainage and the movement of loaded cars.\r\n\r\nWhere the strata are horizontal, or nearly so, as in many of the\r\nbituminous mines, the gangway may, and usually does, take a perfectly\r\nstraight course. This is also true where the line of strike has but a\r\nsingle direction, no matter how steep the pitch of the seam may be. But\r\nboth of these conditions are so rare in the anthracite regions that\r\none seldom finds a gangway driven for any considerable distance in\r\none direction. The surface of an inclined coal seam is not dissimilar\r\nto the surface of one side of a range of small hills. Any one who has\r\nseen a railroad track winding in and out along such a range, keeping\r\nto the surface of the ground and preserving a uniformity of grade, can\r\nunderstand why, for the same reasons, the gangway must often change\r\ndirection in following the seam of coal. It must curve in around the\r\nvalleys and hollows that indent the seam in the same manner that a\r\nsurface railroad curves in around the depression where some hillside\r\nbrook runs down to meet the stream, the course of which the railroad\r\ntries to follow; and it must strike out around the projections of the\r\nseam in the same way in which a surface railroad bends out around the\r\nprojecting spurs of the hill range along which it runs. But the coal\r\nseam is more irregular and more uncertain in its outline than the\r\nhillside, and the curves in it are sharper and more varied. The surface\r\nrailroad too may shorten its route and relieve its curves by bridging\r\nits small valleys and cutting through its narrow ridges. For the\r\ngangway this cannot be done. As a rule the coal seam must be followed,\r\nno matter where it leads. And it often leads in strange courses,――in\r\ncourses that at times curve back on themselves like a horseshoe and\r\npoint toward the foot of the shaft. The mining superintendent or\r\nengineer never knows in advance just what tortuous course his main\r\nartery may take. He cannot go over the ground and stake out his line\r\nas a civil engineer does for a surface railway; he must build as he\r\nadvances, not knowing what the rock and coal may hide in the next\r\nfoot ahead of him. He must be prepared to encounter faults, fissures,\r\nstreams of water, diluvial deposits, and every other obstacle known to\r\nmining engineers.\r\n\r\nThere are several systems of laying out a mine for actual working\r\nafter the gangway has been driven a sufficient distance. The one most\r\ncommonly in use in the anthracite region is known as the “pillar and\r\nbreast” system. In the bituminous mines it is called the “pillar and\r\nroom,” and in the mines of Great Britain the “bord and pillar.” It will\r\nbe borne in mind that the mine which is now being described is in the\r\nWyoming region, where the seams are comparatively flat, the entrance\r\nusually by shaft, and the method of working is the pillar and breast\r\nsystem. The gangway and airway are not driven far, not more than two\r\nor three hundred feet, perhaps, before the openings are made for the\r\nlarger production of coal. Beginning on the upper side of the airway,\r\nat such a distance from the shaft as will leave a reasonably large\r\nsustaining pillar, perhaps from sixty to one hundred feet, an opening\r\nis made and driven up the seam at right angles to the airway. This\r\nopening is called a “chamber” or “breast.” In the bituminous districts\r\nit is known as a “room.” The chamber is usually about twenty-four\r\nfeet wide, though where the roof is exceptionally good its width may\r\nbe increased to thirty-six feet. It is not often opened the full\r\nwidth at the airway. Instead of this a narrow passage, large enough\r\nto accommodate the mine car track, is driven up to a distance not\r\nexceeding fifteen feet, and it is from this point that the chamber is\r\ndriven up at its full width. This narrow opening can be more easily\r\nclosed in case it is desired to prevent the passage of air through\r\nit, and besides a greater proportion of coal is left in pillars along\r\nthe airway to prevent the passage from becoming blockaded by falls.\r\nWhen the first chamber has been driven up a distance equal to its\r\nwidth, a new chamber is begun parallel to it and on the side farthest\r\nfrom the shaft. These two chambers are now separated by a wall of coal\r\nfrom fourteen to twenty feet thick. If, however, the workings are\r\ndeep and there is danger from the weight of superincumbent strata,\r\nthe wall should be made as thick as the chamber is wide. When the new\r\nchamber has been driven to a distance of twenty-five feet, or, if the\r\nmine is free from gas and the ventilation is good, to a distance of\r\nforty or sixty feet, the wall between the two chambers is pierced by\r\nan opening from six to ten feet wide. This is called a cross-heading\r\nor “entrance.” A partition is now built across the airway between the\r\nopenings to the two chambers, and the air current is thus forced up\r\ninto the last chamber, across through the entrance into the first, down\r\nit to the airway again, and so in its regular course back to the foot\r\nof the shaft. In the mean time progress has been made in the first\r\nchamber, and by the time the second chamber has been driven another\r\ndistance of thirty or sixty feet, the entrance which will then be cut\r\nthrough the wall will find the first chamber still in advance. The\r\ninner extremity of the chamber is called the “face.” It is sometimes\r\nspoken of also as the “breast,” though this last name is properly\r\nthat of the chamber as a whole. The wall of coal at the side of the\r\nchamber is called the “rib.” A third chamber is now begun and driven up\r\nparallel to the other two, then a fourth, a fifth, and so on; as many\r\nchambers, indeed, as can be laid off in this way without deviating too\r\ngreatly from a right angle to the airway. But the face of the first\r\nchamber is kept in advance of the face of the second, the face of the\r\nsecond in advance of the face of the third, and so on, until the limit\r\nof length is reached. This limit is determined, to some extent, by the\r\ndip of the seam. In comparatively flat workings a set of chambers may\r\nbe driven in to a distance of five hundred, or even six hundred feet.\r\nWhere the pitch is steep, however, two hundred or three hundred feet is\r\nthe greatest length at which chambers can be economically worked. The\r\nlimit of length of chambers is sometimes determined also by an outcrop,\r\nan anticlinal axis, a fault, or a boundary line. The wall of coal left\r\nbetween any two chambers is divided by the entrances cut through it\r\ninto a line of pillars nearly uniform in size. As soon as the second\r\nentrance from the airway is cut through the wall the first entrance is\r\nblocked tightly up, and as soon as the third entrance is cut through\r\nthe second is closed, and so on to the extremity of the line of\r\npillars. This is to compel the air current to pass up to the very face\r\nof the chamber before it can find a way across to the other chambers\r\nand down again into the airway. If the air of the mine is bad, or if\r\nthe coal is giving off deleterious gases with rapidity, a “brattice” or\r\nrude board partition is built from the lower side of the last entrance\r\ndiagonally up toward the face of the chamber to force the air to the\r\nvery point where men are working before it finds its way out through an\r\nopen entrance. These boards are sometimes replaced by a sheet of coarse\r\ncanvas, called brattice cloth, which is lighter, more easily handled,\r\nand answers the same purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A PLAN OF AN ANTHRACITE MINE WITH A SHAFT ENTRANCE.]\r\n\r\nFrom the mine car track in the gangway a branch track is built,\r\ncrossing the airway and running up each chamber to its face. Up this\r\nbranch track a mule draws the empty car, and when it is loaded it is\r\nlet down to the gangway by the miner’s laborer. If the dip of the\r\nchamber is too steep――more than ten degrees――for a mule to draw the\r\ncar up, a light car, used only in the chamber and called a “buggy,” is\r\npushed up by hand, and when the dip is too steep for this the coal is\r\npushed or allowed to slide down to the foot of the chamber. Chambers\r\nare often driven up obliquely in order to reduce the grade, or are\r\ncurved in their course for the same reason.\r\n\r\nWhen, on account of the steepness of pitch or a change in the direction\r\nof the gangway, or for any other reason, one set of parallel chambers\r\nis brought to a close, a new set is begun farther along with a\r\ndifferent course.\r\n\r\nThe direction in which a gangway, airway, or chamber is to be driven is\r\nfixed by the mine boss. His bearings are obtained with a small miner’s\r\ncompass, and he marks on the roof, near the face of the opening, a\r\nchalk line in the direction desired. The miner, sighting back on this\r\nline, is thus able to take his course and to keep his opening straight.\r\n\r\nSets of chambers similar to those described are driven up from the\r\ngangway along its entire length. This length may be limited by various\r\ncauses. A boundary line of property, a fault, a thinning out of the\r\ncoal seam, are some of them. They are usually driven, however, as far\r\nas strict principles of economy will allow. A gangway that requires no\r\ntimbering and is easily kept in good working condition may be driven\r\nto a distance of three or four miles. But where these conditions are\r\nreversed, a mile may be as great a distance as coal can be hauled\r\nthrough with economy. Beyond that limit it will be cheaper to sink\r\na new shaft or slope than to increase the distance for underground\r\nhaulage.\r\n\r\nAs the main gangway progresses inward it may separate into two\r\nbranches, each following a depression in the coal seam, and these\r\nbranches may separate into others; so that there may be a number of\r\ngangways all keeping the same general level, from each of which sets\r\nof chambers are driven. When the chambers tributary to a gangway\r\nhave reached their limit of length, and there is still an area of\r\ncoal above them to be mined, a new gangway is opened along the faces\r\nof the chambers, or is driven just above them in the solid coal, and\r\nfrom this, which is called a “counter-gangway,” new sets of chambers\r\nare driven up the seam. It is often necessary to raise and lower cars\r\npassing from one gangway to the other on an inclined plane, on which\r\nthe loaded cars, descending, and attached to one end of a rope, pull\r\nup the light cars, ascending and attached to the other end, the rope\r\nitself winding around a revolving drum at the head of the plane. This\r\nsystem can be put into use on any incline where the gradient is one in\r\nthirty, or steeper.\r\n\r\nBy this general system of gangways, counter-gangways, airways,\r\nchambers, and planes, the area of coal lying on the upper side of the\r\nmain gangway and on both sides of the shaft is mined out, hauled by\r\nmules to the foot of the shaft, and raised to the surface. On long\r\nstraight gangways the mule is sometimes replaced by a small mine\r\nlocomotive, and in these later days the electric engine has been\r\nintroduced into the mines as a hauling agent.\r\n\r\nSo far, however, in this mine which we are supposed to be working, not\r\na tap of a drill nor a blow of a pick has been made into the coal on\r\nthe lower side of the gangway save where the sump was excavated at the\r\nfoot of the shaft. If this shaft has been sunk nearly to the bottom\r\nof the basin or synclinal axis, a short tunnel may be driven from the\r\nmain gangway through the rock or upper bench of coal across the valley\r\nto the rise of the seam on the other side. A new gangway may here be\r\ndriven right and left, and this area of coal be made tributary to the\r\nshaft already sunk. It often happens that a large body of coal lies\r\nbetween the main gangway and the synclinal axis, for these two lines\r\nmay diverge greatly as they recede from the shaft. But chambers cannot\r\nbe driven down from the main gangway owing to the difficulties of\r\ntransportation and drainage. It therefore becomes necessary, in order\r\nto work this area, to sink a slope from the main gangway down to or\r\ntoward the synclinal axis, and from the foot of this slope to drive a\r\nnew gangway. From this new gangway chambers will be opened extending up\r\nthe seam to the line of the main gangway, but not generally breaking\r\nthrough into it. The coal is run down to the lower level gangway,\r\nhauled to the foot of the slope, and hoisted up it to the main gangway.\r\nIt is apparent, however, that the inclined plane system cannot work\r\nhere; the conditions are reversed; the loaded cars are drawn up and\r\nthe light ones are let down. To do this work it is necessary to bring\r\ninto use a small steam stationary engine, or one working by compressed\r\nair. A common method is to locate the steam engine on the surface\r\nvertically above the head of the underground slope, and to carry power\r\nto the sheaves below by wire ropes running down through bore holes\r\ndrilled for that purpose.\r\n\r\nThe system of slope mining by lifts, which is in common use in the\r\nMiddle and Southern anthracite districts, has been explained in a\r\npreceding chapter. In this system the sump is always made by extending\r\nthe slope a short distance below the level of the gangway. This gangway\r\nis driven from the foot of the slope to the right and left in the same\r\nmanner as in the Wyoming region, except that, the seam being so greatly\r\ninclined, the gangway roof, or a part of it at least, will usually be\r\nof coal instead of slate or rock, and in very steep pitching seams the\r\nairway will be almost vertically above the gangway. The gangway is not\r\nusually so crooked as where the workings are flat, and having been\r\nstarted only three hundred feet down the slope from the surface, it\r\noften follows the coal to some low point on the line of outcrop, and is\r\nthen known as a water level gangway, which is practically the same as a\r\ndrift.\r\n\r\nThe system of opening and working breasts differs somewhat from that\r\nin use in the Northern field. Beginning at such a distance from the\r\nfoot of the slope as will leave a good thick slope pillar for its\r\nprotection, a narrow shute is driven up from the gangway into the coal\r\nto a distance of perhaps thirty feet, at a height of six feet, and\r\nwith a width of from six to nine feet. It is then opened out to its\r\nfull width as a breast and continued up the seam toward the outcrop,\r\nnot often breaking through to daylight unless an airway or manway is\r\nto be made. Parallel breasts are then laid off and worked out by the\r\nusual pillar and breast system. If the dip is less than twelve or\r\nfifteen degrees, the coal may be run down from the working face in a\r\nbuggy, dumped on to a platform or into the shute, and loaded thence\r\ninto a mine car standing on the gangway. If the dip is more than\r\nfifteen degrees the pieces of coal will slide down the breast to the\r\nshute, though if it is under twenty-five or thirty degrees the floor of\r\nthe breast should be laid with sheet iron to lessen the friction and\r\ngive greater facility in movement. In a steep-pitching breast a plank\r\npartition is built across the shute just above the gangway, to hold\r\nback the coal until it is desired to load a car with it. This partition\r\nis called a “battery,” or, if there is a similar partition to hold the\r\ncoal in the breast, a “check battery.” In this partition there is an\r\nopening through which the coal may be drawn when desired, and through\r\nwhich the men may also go to their work, though a separate manway is\r\noften provided. In these steep-pitching breasts the miner works by\r\nstanding on the coal which he has already mined, and which is held back\r\nby the battery, in order to reach the uncut coal above him. There are\r\nvarious systems of shutes, batteries, man ways, etc., in use, but\r\nall are based on the same principles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROUND PLAN AND LONGITUDINAL SECTION OF CHAMBER.]\r\n\r\nWhen the gangway of the first lift has reached its limit in both\r\ndirections, and the breasts from it have been worked up to their limit,\r\nthe slope is sunk to another distance of three hundred feet, and the\r\nprocess is repeated. From the gangway of the second lift the breasts\r\nare not extended up far enough to break through into the gangway\r\nabove; a wall of coal is left between that gangway and the faces of\r\nthe breasts, from fifteen to forty feet in thickness, known as the\r\n“chain-pillar.” This is for the protection of the upper gangway against\r\nfalls and crushes, and is also necessary to hold back water from\r\nescaping into the lower level. These lifts will continue, at distances\r\nof about three hundred feet apart, until the synclinal valley is\r\nreached.\r\n\r\nWhen the method of opening the mine by a shaft is employed in these\r\nsteep-pitching seams, the shaft is sunk to the lowest level, and the\r\nsuccessive sets of gangways and breasts are laid off as the work\r\nprogresses upwards; that is, the slope method of extending the lifts\r\ndownwards is simply reversed.\r\n\r\nThe method of mining by tunnel and drift, and by slope in the flat\r\nworkings, is not different from the method already described for\r\nshafts. So soon as the drift, tunnel, or slope has extended far enough\r\ninto the coal seam it becomes a gangway, chambers are laid off from\r\nit, and mining goes on in the familiar mode.\r\n\r\nVarious modifications of the pillar and breast system are employed in\r\nthe anthracite coal mines, but no system is in use which is radically\r\ndifferent.\r\n\r\nIn the “long wall system,” common in Great Britain, and used to some\r\nextent in the bituminous mines of Pennsylvania and the Western States,\r\nthe process of cutting coal is carried on simultaneously along an\r\nextended face. The roof is allowed to fall, back of the workers, roads\r\nbeing preserved to the gangway, and the roof at the face is temporarily\r\nsupported by an abundance of wooden props.\r\n\r\nThe descriptions of underground workings that have now been given have,\r\nof necessity, been very general in their character. It is impossible,\r\nin a limited space, to describe the various methods and modifications\r\nof methods which are in use. No two mines, even in the same district,\r\nare worked exactly alike. Sometimes they differ widely in plan and\r\noperation. That system must be employed in each one which will best\r\nmeet its peculiar requirements. There is large scope here for the play\r\nof inventive genius. There is scarcely a mine of any importance in\r\nthe entire coal region in which one cannot find some new contrivance,\r\nsome ingenious scheme, some masterpiece of invention devised to meet\r\nsome special emergency which may have arisen for the first time in\r\nthe history of mining. Yet the general features of all coal mining\r\nmethods must of necessity be the same in underground workings. No one\r\nreasonably familiar with them could ever mistake a map of a coal mine\r\nfor a map of anything else under the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE MINER AT WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe number of persons employed in a single mine in the anthracite\r\nregions varies from a dozen in the newest and smallest mines to seven\r\nhundred or eight hundred in the largest and busiest. The average would\r\nprobably be between two hundred and three hundred. In the bituminous\r\ndistricts the average is not so large.\r\n\r\nFirst among those who go down into the mine is the mine boss, or, as\r\nhe is sometimes called, the “inside boss.” It is his duty “to direct\r\nand generally supervise the whole working of the mine.” All the workmen\r\nare under his control, and everything is done in obedience to his\r\norders. He reports to, and receives instructions from, the general\r\nsuperintendent of the mines.\r\n\r\nNext in authority is the fire boss. It is his duty to examine, every\r\nmorning before the men come to their work, every place in the mine\r\nwhere explosive gas is evolved or likely to be evolved, and to give\r\nthe necessary instructions to the workmen regarding the same. He also\r\nhas general oversight of the ventilating system, and sees that all\r\nstoppings, doors, brattices, and airways are kept in proper condition.\r\nThe driver boss has charge of the driver boys and door boys, and sees\r\nthat the mules are properly cared for and are not abused. Each driver\r\nboy has charge of a mule, and the mule draws the empty cars in along\r\nthe gangway and up to the faces of the chambers, and draws the loaded\r\ncars out to the foot of the shaft. The door boy must stay at his post\r\nall day and open and close the door for the cars to pass in and out.\r\nThe use and necessity of these doors will be explained in a subsequent\r\nchapter. Then there are the footmen, carpenters, blacksmiths, masons,\r\nand tracklayers, whose occupations in the mines are apparent from the\r\nnames which indicate their several callings.\r\n\r\nFinally we have the miners and the miners’ laborers, and it now becomes\r\na matter of especial interest to inquire into the character of their\r\nwork and their manner of performing it. To drive a gangway or airway\r\nis much the same as driving a chamber, except that the gangway is\r\nonly about one third the width of a chamber, and must be driven on a\r\nslightly ascending grade. Gangway driving is special work, for which\r\nthe miner receives special wages, it being impossible in this work to\r\nsend out as much coal with the same amount of labor as can be sent out\r\nin chamber work. And since the great bulk of coal is taken from the\r\nchambers, it will be better to observe in one of them the processes of\r\nmining.\r\n\r\nThere are usually four workmen, two miners and two laborers, employed\r\nin each chamber. The miners are employed by, or are under contract\r\nwith, the coal company, and the laborers are employed by the miners,\r\nsubject to the approval of the mining superintendent. The two miners\r\ndivide their profits or wages equally with each other, and are called\r\n“butties.” A miner’s butty is the man who works the chamber with him on\r\nhalves. A laborer’s butty is the man who is associated with him in the\r\nemploy of the same miners. Between the miner and the laborer there is\r\na well-defined and strictly observed line of social demarcation. The\r\nminer belongs to the aristocracy of underground workers; the laborer\r\nis of a lower order, whose great ambition it is to be elevated, at an\r\nearly day, to that height on which his employer stands.\r\n\r\nNow as to the work done by these four men. Before the chamber has\r\nprogressed a pillar’s length above the airway, propping will usually\r\nbe necessary to sustain the roof, so large an area of which has been\r\nleft without support. Hardwood props about nine inches in diameter\r\nare used for the purpose. They are purchased by the mining companies\r\nin large quantities, and are usually cut and hauled to the railroad\r\nin the winter time to be shipped at any season to the mines. By the\r\nlaw of 1885 the person or company operating a mine is obliged to\r\nfurnish to the miner, at the face of his chamber, as many props of the\r\nrequired length as he may need. Having received the props the miner\r\nhimself sets them on each side of the middle line of the chamber at\r\nsuch points as he thinks require them, or at such points as the mine\r\nboss designates. He drives the prop to its place by means of a large\r\nflat wedge inserted between the top of it and the roof, thus making\r\nthe stick tight and firm and also giving it a larger bearing against\r\nthe roof. Some chambers require very few props; others must be well\r\nlined with them. Their necessity depends upon the character of the\r\nroof. If it is soft, slaty, and loose it must be supported at frequent\r\nintervals. It very rarely occurs that a chamber, worked to its limit,\r\nhas needed no propping from its foot to its face. Usually a good part\r\nof the miner’s time is occupied in setting props as his work at the\r\nface advances.\r\n\r\nEvery seam has its top and bottom bench of coal, divided about midway\r\nby a thin slate partition, and one bench is always taken out to a\r\nhorizontal depth of four or five feet before the other one is mined.\r\nIf the upper bench contains the best and cleanest coal, with the\r\nsmoothest plane of cleavage at the roof, that is first taken out; but\r\nif the choice coal lies at the bottom, then the lower bench is first\r\nmined. The reason for this is that a shot heavy enough to blast out\r\neffectually the section of rough, bony, or slaty coal which sticks to\r\nthe roof or floor would be heavy enough to shatter the adjoining bench\r\nof clean brittle coal, and make a large part of it so fine as to be\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose that the miner has a clean, vertical wall of coal\r\nat the face of his chamber in which to begin work. Making sure that\r\nhis tools and materials are all at hand, he first takes up his drill.\r\nThis is a round or hexagonal iron bar about one and an eighth inches in\r\ndiameter, and about five and a half feet long, tipped at the working\r\nend with steel. This end is flattened out into a blade or chisel,\r\nhaving a slight concave curve on its edge, and being somewhat wider at\r\nits extremity than the diameter of the bar. At the other end of the\r\ndrill the diameter is increased to one and a half inches, forming a\r\ncircular ridge at the extremity of the bar, in one side of which ridge\r\na semicircular notch is cut into the face of the drill. The use of this\r\nnotch will be subsequently explained. This, then, is the tool with\r\nwhich the miner begins his work. Selecting the bench to be first mined\r\nhe chooses a point a few feet to the right or left of the middle line\r\nof the face and delivers upon it the first stroke with the sharp edge\r\nof his drill; and as he strikes successive blows he rotates the drill\r\nin his hands in order to make the hole round. The drill is never struck\r\non the head with sledges. Its cutting force depends on the momentum\r\ngiven to it in the hands of the miner, and the stroke made by it is a\r\njumping or elastic stroke.\r\n\r\nInstead of the bar drill, which has been described, many of the miners\r\nuse a machine hand-drill for boring holes. This machine works upon the\r\nsame principle that the jackscrew does. It is operated by hand by means\r\nof a crank, and an auger-like projection forces its way into the coal.\r\nThe work of turning the crank is more laborious than that of drilling\r\nwith the bar-drill, but the extra labor is much more than compensated\r\nfor by the greater speed at which boring is done. It is probably due\r\nto the spirit of conservatism among miners that this machine is not\r\nin general use by them. Coal-cutting machines, working by steam or\r\ncompressed air, are not used in the anthracite mines. The character of\r\nthe coal, the thickness of the seams, and the inclination of the strata\r\nmake their employment impracticable.\r\n\r\nWhen the hole has been drilled to a depth of about four and a half\r\nfeet it is carefully cleaned out with a scraper. This is a light iron\r\nrod with a handle on one end of it and a little spoon, turned up like\r\na mustard spoon, on the other end. Then the cartridge is inserted and\r\npushed in to the farther extremity of the hole. The cartridge is simply\r\na tube made of heavy manila paper formed over a cartridge stick, filled\r\nwith black powder, and folded at the ends. Dynamite and other high\r\nexplosives are not used, because they create too much waste. Ready-made\r\ncartridges in jointed sections are largely used, but as a rule the\r\nminer makes his own cartridge as he needs it.\r\n\r\nThe miner’s needle is an iron rod about five and one half feet in\r\nlength, with a handle at one end. It is about five eighths of an inch\r\nin diameter at the handle end, and tapers to a point at the other end.\r\nWhen the cartridge has been pushed in to the extreme end of the bore\r\nhole, the needle is inserted also, the point of it piercing the outer\r\nend of the cartridge. The needle is then allowed to rest on the bottom\r\nor at the side of the drill hole while the miner gathers fine dirt from\r\nthe floor of the mine, dampens it slightly if it is dry, and pushes\r\nit into the hole alongside. This dirt is then forced in against the\r\ncartridge with the head of the drill. More dirt is put in and driven\r\nhome, and still more, until, by the time the hole is filled to its\r\nouter extremity, the packing is hard and firm. This process is called\r\ntamping. It can now be seen that the semicircular notch on the rim of\r\nthe blunt end of the drill is for the purpose of allowing the drill\r\nto slip along over the needle, which still retains its position, and\r\nat the same time to fill the diameter of the hole. The tamping being\r\nfinished the miner takes hold of the needle by the handle, turns it\r\nonce or twice gently in its bed, and then slowly withdraws it. A round,\r\nsmooth channel is thus left from the outside directly in to the powder\r\nof the cartridge, and into this channel the squib is inserted. The\r\nsquib is simply an elongated fire-cracker. It has about the diameter\r\nof a rye straw, is about four inches in length, and its covering\r\nprojects an inch or two at one end and is twisted up for a fuse. The\r\ncovering of the squib may indeed be of straw, sometimes it is of hempen\r\nmaterial, but more often, in these days, it is made of paper. It is\r\nfilled with powder and is then dipped into a resinous mixture to make\r\nit water-proof, to coat over the open end so that the powder shall not\r\nrun out, and to make the wick at the other end mildly inflammable. If\r\nthe bore hole should be very wet an iron or copper tube, through which\r\nthe needle is run, is laid to the cartridge before the hole is tamped,\r\nand when the needle is withdrawn the squib is inserted into the mouth\r\nof the tube. If inflammable gases are exuding from the coal through the\r\nbore hole, or if for any other reason it is feared that the cartridge\r\nwill be exploded too quickly, a short piece of cotton wick, dipped in\r\noil, is attached to the fuse of the squib to lengthen it, and this\r\nextra section of fuse is allowed to hang down from the mouth of the\r\nbore hole against the face of coal.\r\n\r\nWhen all is ready the tools are removed to a safe distance, a lighted\r\nlamp is touched to the fuse, the men cry “Fire!” to warn all who may\r\nbe in the vicinity, and, retreating down the chamber, they take refuge\r\nbehind some convenient pillar. The fuse burns so slowly that the men\r\nhave ample time in which to get out of harm’s way, if ordinary care is\r\ntaken. When the fire reaches the powder in the squib the same force\r\nthat propels a fire-cracker or a rocket acts upon the squib and sends\r\nit violently through the channel or tube into contact with the powder\r\nof the cartridge. The explosion that results throws out a section of\r\ncoal from the face, breaking it into large pieces. So soon as the\r\nplace has settled after the firing of the shot the men go back to the\r\nface to note the result. The broken coal is pushed to one side, and\r\npreparations are made for drilling the next hole. It usually takes five\r\nshots to break down a single bench. When both benches of coal have been\r\nblasted out the length of the chamber has been increased by five or six\r\nfeet. In blasting, the miner must take advantage of such conditions as\r\nare presented to him at the face of the working, and he will bore his\r\nhole and fire his shot where, in his judgment, the best result will\r\nbe attained. He cannot always take one position at his drilling; it\r\nis rarely that he finds a comfortable one. Sometimes he must hold the\r\ndrill at arm’s length above his head, at other times he must rest on\r\nhis knees while working, still oftener he is obliged to lie on his back\r\nor side on the wet floor of the mine, and work in that position, with\r\noccasional respite, for hours at a time.\r\n\r\nIn nearly every chamber the miner has a powder chest which he keeps\r\nlocked, and which is stored at some safe and convenient place, not too\r\nclose to the face. In this chest he keeps, besides his powder, his\r\ncartridge paper, cartridge pin, squibs, lamp-wick, chalk, and such\r\nother little conveniences and necessaries as every workingman must\r\nhave at hand. The other tools are usually at the face. He has there a\r\nmining pick. This pick is straight and pointed, and from the head or\r\neye, where the handle enters, it will measure about nine inches to each\r\nend. It is used for bringing down slate and coal from roof, ribs, and\r\nface. The bottom pick is used by the laborer for breaking up the coal\r\nafter it is down. This pick measures about two feet from tip to tip,\r\nand is curved slightly upward at the points. Each miner has two drills,\r\nand perhaps a hand machine-drill. He has also a steel crowbar for\r\nprying down loose portions of the roof, and for turning heavy pieces of\r\nslate or coal. He has an eight-pound steel hammer, with a handle two\r\nfeet and four inches in length, which he uses in setting props; and he\r\nhas a heavy sledge for breaking rock and coal. The list is completed by\r\nthree large scoop shovels, used generally to shovel the smaller pieces\r\nof broken coal from the floor of the chamber into the mine car.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MINER’S TOOLS.]\r\n\r\nThe miner must furnish his own tools. His powder, fuse, and oil he gets\r\nfrom the company that employs him, and they are charged to him in the\r\naccount that is stated between them monthly. It will not do to omit\r\nthe miner’s lamp from the list of appliances used in his calling; it\r\nis too great a necessity. Without it he could do absolutely nothing;\r\nhe could not even find his way to his chamber. Formerly candles were\r\nmuch used in the mines; in Great Britain they are still common; but the\r\nanthracite miner invariably uses a lamp. This is a round, flat-bottomed\r\ntin box, about the size of a small after-dinner coffee cup. It has a\r\nhinged lid on top, a spout on one side, and a handle shaped like a hook\r\nwith the point down on the opposite side. By this hooked handle the\r\nlamp is fastened to the front of the miner’s cap, and he wears it so at\r\nhis labor, removing it only for the purpose of renewing the material in\r\nit, or of approaching the powder chest, or of examining more closely\r\nsome portion of his work. In the lamp he burns crude petroleum, which\r\nis fed from a cotton wick emerging from the spout. Very recently\r\nelectricity has been introduced into the gangways of some large mines,\r\nfor lighting purposes, and has given great satisfaction. Perhaps the\r\nday is not far distant when an electric light will swing from the roof\r\nat the face of every working chamber.\r\n\r\nWhen the coal has been blasted down and the props have been set the\r\nminer’s work is done; the rest belongs to the laborers. They must\r\nbreak up the coal, load it into the cars, run it down to the gangway,\r\npile up the refuse, and clear the chamber for the next day’s work. The\r\nmine carpenters have laid a track, consisting of wooden rails set into\r\ncaps or notched ties, as far up the chamber as the working at the face\r\nwould permit. Up this track the mule and driver boy have brought the\r\nempty car and left it at the face. The laborers throw into it first\r\nthe smaller pieces of coal which they shovel up from the floor of the\r\nchamber, then huge chunks are tumbled in and piled skillfully on top\r\nuntil the car is almost overbalanced with its load. It is then pushed\r\nout to the gangway to await the coming of the driver boy, who attaches\r\nit to his trip of loads and takes it to the shaft.\r\n\r\nThe mine car is usually but a smaller edition of the coal cars that can\r\nbe seen any day on the surface railways of the country. The running\r\nportion is of iron, and the box is stoutly built of hardwood, braced\r\nand stiffened by iron tie-rods, bolts, and shoes. At the end of the car\r\nis a vertical swinging door, hung from the top by an iron rod, which\r\ncrosses the box. This door is latched on the outside near the bottom,\r\nand the coal is dumped from the car by tipping it up and letting the\r\nunlatched door swing outward. The size of the car depends greatly on\r\nthe size and character of the workings in which it is used. Perhaps\r\nan average size would be ten feet long, five feet wide, and five feet\r\nhigh from the rail. Such a car would contain about one hundred cubic\r\nfeet, and would hold from two and one half to three tons of coal. The\r\ntrack gauges in common use vary by three inch widths from two feet and\r\nsix inches to four feet. The miner and laborer start to their work\r\nin the morning at six o’clock. If they enter the mine by shaft they\r\nmust go down before seven o’clock, for at that hour the engineer stops\r\nlowering men and begins to hoist coal. Immediately after arriving at\r\nthe face of his chamber the miner begins to cut coal. If the vein is\r\nthick and clean, if his shots are all effective, and if he has good\r\nluck generally, he will cut his allowance of coal for the day by ten\r\nor eleven o’clock in the forenoon. It will be understood that by the\r\nsystem in use by most of the coal companies not more than a certain\r\nnumber of carloads may be sent out from each chamber per day. And when\r\nthe miner has blasted down enough coal to make up that number of loads\r\nhis day’s work is done. It is very seldom indeed that he is not through\r\nbefore two o’clock in the afternoon. But he never stays to assist the\r\nlaborer. It is beneath his dignity as a miner to help break up and\r\nload the coal which has been brought down by means of his judgment and\r\nskill. So the laborer is always last in the chamber. His work is seldom\r\ndone before four or five o’clock in the afternoon. He has just so much\r\ncoal to break up, load, and push down to the gangway, no matter how\r\nsuccessful the miner may have been. He consoles himself, however, by\r\nlooking forward to the time when he shall himself become a miner.\r\n\r\nBlasting is always a dangerous occupation, and the law in Pennsylvania,\r\nembodied in the act of 1885, has recognized its especial danger in the\r\nmines, by making certain provisions concerning it for the protection\r\nof life and limb. The rules laid down are strict and complete, yet,\r\nin spite of them, accidents from powder explosions and premature\r\nblasts are frequent and destructive. But it must be said that these\r\naccidents are due, in most part, to violations of these rules. It is\r\nimpossible for colliery authorities to keep constant watch over the\r\nworkmen in every chamber. The conduct of these men must be largely\r\ngoverned by themselves, and the frequency of accidents, both serious\r\nand fatal, as a result of carelessness on the part of workmen, does\r\nnot seem to deter other workmen from constantly running the same\r\nrisks. The most prevalent and the most serious source of danger to\r\nthe miner is not, however, in blasting, but in falls of coal, slate,\r\nand rock from the roof, ribs, and face of the chamber. Material that\r\nhas become loosened by blasting is pulled down carelessly, or falls\r\nwithout warning. In many cases the roof is insufficiently propped,\r\nand large sections of it give way. Men are caught under these falling\r\nmasses every day, and are either killed outright or seriously injured.\r\nYet, as in the case of blasting, their injuries are largely the result\r\nof their own carelessness. Any one who reads the reports of these\r\ncases cannot fail to be convinced of this fact. The mine inspector’s\r\nreports of Pennsylvania show that during the year 1887 there were in\r\nthe anthracite district three hundred and thirteen fatal accidents\r\nwhich occurred in and about the mines. Of this number one hundred and\r\nforty-seven were due to falls of roof and coal, while only twenty-one\r\nwere caused by explosions of blasting material. These figures indicate\r\nplainly the direction in which the skill and supervision of operators\r\nand the care and watchfulness of workmen should be exerted for the\r\nprotection of life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nWHEN THE MINE ROOF FALLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA first visit to a coal mine will be prolific of strange sights and\r\nsounds and of novel sensations. If one enters the mine by a shaft,\r\nthe first noteworthy experience will be the descent on the cage or\r\ncarriage. The visitor will probably be under the care of one of the\r\nmine foremen, without whose presence or authority he would not be\r\nallowed to descend, and indeed would not wish to. From the head to the\r\nfoot of every shaft a speaking tube extends, and signaling apparatus,\r\nwhich is continued to the engine-room. These appliances are required\r\nby law. In these days the signals are often operated by electricity.\r\nAt the head of the shaft is stationed a headman and at the foot of the\r\nshaft a footman, whose assistants aid in pushing cars on and off the\r\ncarriages. The footman is notified of your coming, and you take your\r\nplace on the empty safety carriage. It swings slightly as you step on\r\nto it, just enough to make you realize that you have passed from the\r\nstable to the unstable, and that besides the few inches of planking\r\nunder your feet, there is nothing between you and the floor of the\r\nmine, five hundred feet or more below you. When all is ready the\r\nforeman cries: “Slack off!” the signal to the engineer is given, the\r\ncarriage is slightly raised, the wings are withdrawn, and the descent\r\nbegins. If the carriage goes down as rapidly as it ordinarily does\r\nyour first sensation will be that of falling. It will seem as though\r\nthat on which you were standing has been suddenly removed from beneath\r\nyour feet, and your impulse will be to grasp for something above you.\r\nYou will hardly have recovered from this sensation when it will seem\r\nto you that the motion of the carriage has been reversed, and that\r\nyou are now going up more rapidly than you were at first descending.\r\nThere will be an alternation of these sensations during the minute or\r\ntwo occupied in the descent, until finally the motion of the carriage\r\nbecomes suddenly slower, and you feel it strike gently at the bottom\r\nof the shaft. As you step out into the darkness nothing is visible to\r\nyou except the shifting flames of the workmen’s lamps; you cannot even\r\nsee distinctly the men who carry them. You are given a seat on the\r\nfootman’s bench near by until your eyes have accommodated themselves to\r\nthe situation. After a few minutes you are able to distinguish objects\r\nthat are ten or fifteen feet away. You can see through the murky\r\natmosphere the rough walls of solid coal about you, the flat, black,\r\nmoist roof overhead, the mine car tracks at your feet. The carriages\r\nappear and disappear, and are loaded and unloaded at the foot of the\r\nshaft, while the passage, at one side of which you sit, is filled with\r\nmine cars, mules, and driver boys in apparently inextricable confusion.\r\nThe body of a mule looms up suddenly in front of you; you catch a\r\nglimpse of a boy hurrying by; a swarthy face, lighted up by the flame\r\nof a lamp gleams out of the darkness, but the body that belongs to it\r\nis in deep shadow, you cannot see it. Bare, brawny arms become visible\r\nand are withdrawn, men’s voices sound strange, there is a constant\r\nrumbling of cars, a regular clicking sound as the carriage stops and\r\nstarts, incessant shouting by the boys; somewhere the sound of falling\r\nwater. Such are the sights and sounds at the shaft’s foot. If now you\r\npass in along the gangway, you will be apt to throw the light of your\r\nlamp to your feet to see where you are stepping. You will experience a\r\nsense of confinement in the narrow passage with its low roof and close,\r\nblack walls. Occasionally you will have to crowd against the rib to\r\nlet a trip of mine cars, drawn by a smoking mule, in charge of a boy\r\nwith soiled face and greasy clothes, pass by. Perhaps you walk up one\r\nof the inclined planes to a counter gangway. You are lucky if you are\r\nin a mine where the roof is so high that you need not bend over as you\r\nwalk. The men whom you meet have little lamps on their caps, smoking\r\nand flaring in the strong air current. You can see little of these\r\npersons except their soiled faces. Everything here is black and dingy;\r\nthere is no color relief to outline the form of any object. Now you\r\ncome to a door on the upper side of the gangway. A small boy jumps up\r\nfrom a bench and pulls the door open for the party to pass through. As\r\nit closes behind you the strong current of air nearly extinguishes your\r\nlamp. You walk along the airway for a little distance, and then you\r\ncome to the foot of a chamber. Up somewhere in the darkness, apparently\r\nfar away, you see lights twinkling, four of them. They appear and\r\ndisappear, they bob up and down, they waver from side to side, till\r\nyou wonder what strange contortions the people who carry them must be\r\ngoing through to give them such erratic movements. By and by there is\r\na cry of “Fire!” the cry is repeated several times, three lights move\r\ndown the chamber toward you and suddenly disappear, then the fourth\r\none approaches apparently with more action, and disappears also. The\r\nmen who carry them have hidden behind pillars. You wait one, two,\r\nthree minutes, looking into darkness. Then there is a sudden wave-like\r\nmovement in the air; it strikes your face, you feel it in your ears;\r\nthe flame of your lamp is blown aside. Immediately there is the sound\r\nof an explosion and the crash of falling blocks of coal. The waves of\r\ndisturbed air still touch your face gently. Soon the lights reappear,\r\nall four of them, and advance toward the face. In a minute they are\r\nswallowed up in the powder smoke that has rolled out from the blast;\r\nyou see only a faint blur, and their movements are indistinct. But when\r\nthe smoke has reached and passed you the air is clearer again, and the\r\nlights twinkle and dance as merrily as they did before the blast was\r\nfired. Now you go up the chamber, taking care not to stumble over the\r\nhigh caps, into the notches of which the wooden rails of the track are\r\nlaid. On one side of you is a wall, built up with pieces of slate and\r\nbony coal and the refuse of the mine, on the other you can reach out\r\nyour hand and touch the heavy wooden props that support the roof, and\r\nbeyond the props there is darkness, or if the rib of coal is visible it\r\nis barely distinct. Up at the face there is a scene of great activity.\r\nBare-armed men, without coat or vest, are working with bar and pick\r\nand shovel, moving the fallen coal from the face, breaking it, loading\r\nit into the mine car which stands near by. The miners are at the face\r\nprying down loose pieces of coal. One takes his lamp in his hand and\r\nflashes its light along the black, broken, shiny surface, deciding upon\r\nthe best point to begin the next drill hole, discussing the matter with\r\nhis companion, giving quick orders to the laborers, acting with energy\r\nand a will. He takes up his drill, runs his fingers across the edge\r\nof it professionally, balances it in his hands, and strikes a certain\r\npoint on the face with it, turning it slightly at each stroke. He has\r\ntaken his position, lying on his side perhaps, and then begins the\r\nregular tap, tap, of the drill into the coal. The laborers have loaded\r\nthe mine car, removed the block from the wheel, and now, grasping the\r\nend of it firmly, hold back on it as it moves by gravity down the\r\nchamber to the gangway. You may follow it out, watch the driver boy as\r\nhe attaches it to his trip, and go with him back to the foot of the\r\nshaft.\r\n\r\nYou have seen something of the operation of taking out coal, something\r\nof the ceaseless activity which pervades the working portions of the\r\nmine. But your visit to the mine has been at a time when hundreds of\r\nmen are busy around you, when the rumble, the click, the tap, the noise\r\nof blasting, the sound of human voices, are incessant. If you were\r\nthere alone, the only living being in the mine, you would experience a\r\ndifferent set of sensations. If you stood or sat motionless you would\r\nfind the silence oppressive. One who has not had this experience can\r\nhave no adequate conception of the profound stillness of a deserted\r\nmine. On the surface of the earth one cannot find a time nor a place\r\nin which the ear is not assailed by noises; the stirring of the\r\ngrasses in the field at midnight sends sound-waves traveling through\r\nspace. Wherever there is life there is motion, and wherever there is\r\nmotion there is sound. But down here there is no life, no motion, no\r\nsound. The silence is not only oppressive, it is painful, it becomes\r\nunbearable. No person could be long subjected to it and retain his\r\nreason; it would be like trying to live in an element to which the\r\nhuman body is not adapted. Suppose you are not only in silence but in\r\ndarkness. There is no darkness on the surface of the earth that is at\r\nall comparable with the darkness of the mine. On the surface the eyes\r\ncan grow accustomed to the deepest gloom of night. Clouds cannot shut\r\nout every ray of light from hidden moon or stars. But down in the mine,\r\nwhether in night-time or daytime, there is no possible lightening up\r\nof the gloom by nature; she cannot send her brightest sunbeam through\r\nthree hundred feet of solid rock. If one is in the mines without a\r\nlight, he has before him, behind him, everywhere, utter blackness. To\r\nbe lost in this way, a mile from any opening to day, in the midst of a\r\nconfusion of galleries, in an abandoned mine, and to be compelled to\r\nfeel one’s way to safety, is a painful experience, is one indeed which\r\nthe writer himself has had.\r\n\r\nThere comes a time in the history of every mine when it is pervaded\r\nonly by silence and darkness. All the coal that can be carried from it\r\nby the shaft or slope or other outlet has been mined and taken out,\r\nand the place is abandoned. But before this comes to pass the work\r\nof robbing the pillars must be done. This work consists in breaking\r\nfrom the pillars as much coal as can possibly be taken without too\r\ngreat risk to the workmen. The process is begun at the faces of\r\nthe chambers, at the farthest extremity of the mine, and the work\r\nprogresses constantly toward the shaft or other opening by which the\r\ncoal thus obtained is taken out. It can readily be seen that robbing\r\npillars is a dangerous business. For so soon as the column becomes\r\ntoo slender to support the roof it will give way and the slate and\r\nrock will come crashing down into the chamber. The workmen must be\r\nconstantly on the alert, watchful for every sign of danger, but at the\r\nbest some will be injured, some will perhaps be killed, by the falling\r\nmasses from the roof. Yet this work must be done, otherwise coal\r\nmining would not be profitable, the waste would be too great. The coal\r\nthat can be taken out under the prevailing systems will average only\r\nfifty per cent. of the whole body in the mine, and at least ten per\r\ncent. more will be lost in waste at the breaker, so that it behooves\r\na company to have its pillars robbed as closely as possible. It is\r\nafter all this has been done, and all tools and appliances have been\r\nremoved from the mine, that it is abandoned. Perhaps the lower levels\r\nof it become filled with water. It is a waste of crushed pillars,\r\nfallen rock, and blocked passages. Indeed, it is difficult to conceive\r\nof anything more weird and desolate than an abandoned mine. To walk\r\nor climb or creep through one is like walking with Dante through\r\nthe regions of the lost. There are masses of rock piled up in great\r\nconfusion to the jagged roof, dull surfaces of coal and slate, rotting\r\ntimbers patched here and there with spots of snow-white fungus, black\r\nstretches of still water into which a bit of falling slate or coal\r\nwill strike and send a thousand echoes rattling through the ghostly\r\nchambers. For a noise which on the surface of the earth will not break\r\nthe quiet of a summer night, down here will almost make your heart\r\nstand still with fear, so startling is it in distinctness.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only in abandoned mines that falls of roof take place,\r\nnor yet alone at the unpropped face of breast or gangway. They are\r\nliable to occur at almost any point in any mine. Sometimes only a small\r\npiece of slate, not larger perhaps than a shingle, will come down;\r\nagain the roof of an entire chamber will fall. It is possible that two\r\nor more chambers will be involved in the disturbance, and instances\r\noccasionally occur in a working mine where a fall covers an area\r\nmany acres in extent. The falls that are limited in extent, that are\r\nconfined to a single chamber or the face of a chamber, do not interfere\r\nwith the pillars and can be readily cleared away. They are due to lack\r\nof support for the roof, to insufficient propping and injudicious\r\nblasting, and may, to a great extent, be guarded against successfully\r\nby care and watchfulness. But to foresee or prevent the more extended\r\nfalls is often impossible. They are due to the general pressure of\r\noverlying strata over a considerable area, and both props and pillars\r\ngive way under so great a strain. Sometimes they come without a\r\nmoment’s warning; usually, however, their approach is indicated by\r\nunmistakable signs days or even weeks in advance of the actual fall.\r\nThere will be cracks in the roof, small pieces of slate will drop to\r\nthe floor, the distance between floor and roof will grow perceptibly\r\nless, pillars will bulge in the middle and little fragments of coal\r\nnot larger than peas will break from them with a crackling sound and\r\nfall to the floor, until a deposit of fine coal is thus formed at\r\nthe base of each pillar in the infected district. This crackling and\r\nfalling is known as “working,” and this general condition is called\r\na “crush” or a “squeeze.” If one stands quite still in a section of\r\na mine where there is a squeeze, he will hear all about him, coming\r\nfrom the “working” pillars, these faint crackling noises, like the\r\nsnapping of dry twigs under the feet. Sometimes the floor of underclay\r\nor the roof of shale is so soft that the pillar, instead of bulging or\r\nbreaking, enters the strata above or below as the roof settles. When\r\nthis occurs it is called “creeping.” In the steep-pitching veins the\r\ntendency of the pillars on the approach of a squeeze is to “slip,”\r\nthat is, to move perceptibly down the incline. When these indications\r\noccur the workmen are withdrawn from the portion of the mine which is\r\n“working,” and vigorous measures are taken to counteract the pressure,\r\nby props and other supports placed under the roof. Sometimes this work\r\nis effectual, sometimes it is of no avail whatever. Often the fall\r\ncomes before the first prop can be set; and when it comes the crash is\r\nterrible, the destruction is great. However, not many feet in thickness\r\nof the roof strata can come down; the slate and rock which first fall\r\nare broken and heaped in such irregular masses on the floor that they\r\nsoon extend up to the roof and afford it new and effectual support.\r\nIt is therefore only near the outcrop, or where the mine is not deep,\r\nthat a fall in it disturbs the earth at the surface. But in the\r\nmining of the upper veins such disturbances were frequent. In passing\r\nthrough the coal regions one will occasionally see a depression, or a\r\nseries of depressions, in the earth’s surface to which his attention\r\nwill be attracted on account of their peculiar shape. They are not\r\noften more than ten or fifteen feet in depth, and though of irregular\r\noutline their approximate diameter seldom exceeds sixty feet. They\r\nare the surface indications of a fall in shallow mines, and are known\r\nas “caves” or “cave holes.” A section of country one or more acres\r\nin extent may, however, be so strewn with them as to make the land\r\npractically valueless.\r\n\r\nWhen the upper vein in the Wyoming region was being mined, buildings\r\non the surface were occasionally disturbed by these falls, but not\r\noften. If houses had been erected over a shallow mine before the coal\r\nwas taken out, strong pillars were left under them to support the\r\nroof, and if the mining had already been done and the pillars robbed,\r\nno one would risk the erection of a building over a place liable to\r\nfall, for these places were known, and points above them on the surface\r\ncould be definitely located. Sensational stories are sometimes started\r\nconcerning a mining town or city that it is liable any night, while\r\nits inhabitants are asleep, to be engulfed in the depths of some mine,\r\nthe vast cavities of which are spread out beneath it. It is almost\r\nunnecessary to say that such dangers are purely imaginary. There is\r\nprobably not a town or city in the mining districts so located that a\r\nsingle stone of it in the populated portion would be disturbed by a\r\nfall in the mines underneath it, supposing there were mines underneath\r\nit, and that a fall is liable to take place in them. The areas of\r\nsurface which could possibly be disturbed by a fall are too limited in\r\nextent, and are too well known, to make such a general catastrophe at\r\nall within the possibilities. The mines in the upper coal seams have\r\nfor the most part been worked out and abandoned long ago, and the roof\r\nrock has settled into permanent position and rigidity. In the deep\r\nmines of the present day no fall, however extensive, could be felt\r\nat the surface. The broken masses of roof rock that come down first\r\nwould have filled up the cavities and supported the strata above them,\r\nlong before any perceptible movement could have reached the surface.\r\nThe conditions that lead to surface falls in the Middle and Southern\r\nregions are somewhat different from those that prevail in the Wyoming\r\nfield. In the first-mentioned districts steep-pitching coal seams are\r\nthe rule, and they all come to the surface in lines of outcrop. In\r\ndriving breasts up from the gangway of the first level, it is intended\r\nto leave from ten to twelve yards of coal between the face of the\r\nbreast and the outcrop; while over the outcrop will be from twelve\r\nto twenty feet of soil. Any experienced miner can tell when the face\r\nof the breast is approaching the outcrop; the coal becomes softer,\r\nchanges in color, breaks into smaller pieces, sometimes water runs\r\ndown through. It is obviously unsafe to erect buildings on the line\r\nof this outcrop, or immediately inside of it, where the roof is thin.\r\nThere is no assurance that the body of coal left will not slip down the\r\nbreast; and the pillars of coal near the surface are so soft that any\r\ndisturbance of this kind may cause them to give way and let down the\r\nentire thickness of strata above them. This was what occurred at the\r\nStockton mines near Hazleton on December 18, 1869. Two double tenement\r\nhouses were situated over the face of a worked-out breast, near the\r\noutcrop. About five o’clock in the morning the roof fell, carrying\r\nboth houses down with it a distance of about eighty feet into the old\r\nbreast. The inhabitants of one of the houses escaped from it a moment\r\nbefore it went down, those in the other house, ten in number, were\r\ncarried into the mine, and were killed. The buildings in the pit took\r\nfire almost immediately, and rescue of the bodies crushed there among\r\nthe débris was impossible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GANGWAY IN KOHINOOR COLLIERY, NEAR SHENANDOAH, PA.]\r\n\r\nAccidents of this class are happily very rare. The exercise of ordinary\r\njudgment is sufficient to prevent them. The list of disasters due to\r\nfalls of roof at the faces of chambers might, as has already been\r\nexplained, be greatly reduced by the same means. But it is often\r\nimpossible to prevent, or even to guard against, those falls which\r\ncover a large area, though their coming may be heralded for days by\r\nthe working of pillars and all the indications of a squeeze. This was\r\nthe case at the fall in the Carbondale mines in 1846, one of the most\r\nextensive falls that has ever been known. It covered an area of from\r\nforty to fifty acres, fourteen persons were killed by it, and the\r\nbodies of eight of them were never recovered. Although this disaster\r\noccurred more than forty years ago, the writer had the privilege,\r\nin the summer of 1888, of hearing an account of it from one of the\r\nsurvivors, Mr. Andrew Bryden. Mr. Bryden is now, and has been for many\r\nyears, one of the general mining superintendents for the Pennsylvania\r\nCoal Company, with headquarters at Pittston, Pennsylvania. His story\r\nof the fall is as follows: “This disaster occurred on the twelfth day\r\nof January, 1846, at about eight o’clock in the forenoon. It was\r\nin Drifts No. 1 and No. 2 of the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company’s\r\nmines at Carbondale. The part of the mine in which the caving in was\r\nmost serious was on the plane heading, at the face of which I was\r\nat work. We heard the fall; it came like a thunderclap. We felt the\r\nconcussion distinctly, and the rush of air occasioned by it put out\r\nour lights. I and those who were working with me knew that the fall\r\nhad come, and we thought it better to try immediately to find our way\r\nout, although we had no idea that the fall had been so extensive or\r\nthe calamity so great. We did not doubt but that we should be able to\r\nmake our way along the faces of the chambers, next to the solid coal,\r\nto an opening at the outcrop; so we relighted our lamps and started. We\r\nhad gone but a little way before we saw the effects of the tremendous\r\nrush of air. Loaded cars had been lifted and thrown from the track,\r\nand the heavy walls with which entrances were blocked had been torn\r\nout and the débris scattered through the chambers. We began then to\r\nbelieve that the fall had been a large one, but before we reached the\r\nline of it we met a party of twenty-five or thirty men. They were\r\nmuch frightened, and were running in toward the face of the heading,\r\nthe point from which we had just come. They said that the entire mine\r\nhad caved in; that the fall had extended close up to the faces of the\r\nchambers along the line of solid coal, leaving no possible means of\r\nescape in the direction we were going; and that the only safe place in\r\nthe entire section was the place which we were leaving, at the face of\r\nthe heading. This heading having been driven for some distance into\r\nthe solid coal, the fall could not well reach in to the face of it. We\r\nwere greatly discouraged by the news that these men told us, and we\r\nturned back and went with them in to the face of the heading. We had\r\nlittle hope of being able to get out through the body of the fall,――the\r\nway in which we did finally escape,――for we knew that the mine had\r\nbeen working, and that the roof had been breaking down that morning\r\nin the lower level. Indeed, we could hear it at that moment cracking,\r\ncrashing, and falling with a great noise. We felt that the only safe\r\nplace was at the face of the heading where we were, and most of the\r\nparty clung closely to it. Some of us would go out occasionally to the\r\nlast entrance to listen and investigate, but the noise of the still\r\nfalling roof was so alarming that no one dared venture farther. After\r\na long time spent thus in waiting I suggested that we should start out\r\nin parties of three or four, so that we should not be in each other’s\r\nway, and so that all of us should not be exposed to the same particular\r\ndanger, and try to make our way through the fall. But the majority of\r\nthe men were too much frightened to accede to this proposition; they\r\nwere determined that we should all remain together. So when some of\r\nus started out the whole body rushed out after us, and followed along\r\nuntil we came to the line of the fall. We had succeeded in picking our\r\nway but a short distance through the fallen portion of the mine when\r\nwe met my father, Alexander Bryden, coming toward us. He was foreman\r\nof the mine. We heard him calling us out before he reached us, and\r\nyou may be sure that no more welcome sound ever struck upon our ears.\r\nHe was outside when the fall came, but the thunder of it had scarcely\r\nceased before he started in to learn its extent, and to rescue, if\r\npossible, the endangered men. He had not gone far when he met three men\r\nhastening toward the surface, who told him how extensive and dreadful\r\nthe calamity had been, and urged him not to imperil his life by going\r\nfarther. But my father was determined to go, and he pushed on. He made\r\nhis way over hills of fallen rock, he crawled under leaning slabs of\r\nslate, he forced his body through apertures scarcely large enough to\r\nadmit it, he hurried under hanging pieces of roof that crashed down in\r\nhis path the moment he had passed; and finally he came to us. I have\r\nno doubt that he was as glad to find us and help us as we were to see\r\nhim. Then he led us back through the terrible path by which he had\r\ncome, and brought us every one beyond the fall to a place of safety.\r\nWhen we were there my father asked if any person had been left inside.\r\nHe was told that one, Dennis Farrell, was at the face of his chamber,\r\nso badly injured across his spine that he could not walk. The miners\r\nin their retreat to the face of our heading had found him lying under\r\na heavy piece of coal. They had rolled it off from him, but seeing\r\nthat he could not walk they set him up in the corner of his chamber,\r\nthinking it might be as safe a place as the one to which they were\r\ngoing, and gave him a light and left him. My father asked if any one\r\nwould go in with him and help carry Dennis out, but none of them dared\r\nto go; it was too dangerous a journey. So my father made his way back\r\nalone through the fallen mine, and found the crippled and imprisoned\r\nminer. The man was totally helpless, and my father lifted him to his\r\nback and carried him as far as he could. He drew him gently through the\r\nlow and narrow passages of the fall, he climbed with him over the hills\r\nof broken rock, and finally he brought him out to where the other men\r\nwere. They carried him to the surface, a mile farther, and then to his\r\nhome. Dennis and his brother John were working the chamber together,\r\nand when the piece of coal fell upon Dennis his brother ran into the\r\nnext chamber for help. He had scarcely got into it when the roof of the\r\nchamber fell and buried him, and he was never seen again, alive or dead.\r\n\r\n“It was only a little while after we got out before the roof fell in on\r\nthe way we had come and closed it up, and it was not opened again for\r\na year afterward. But we knew there were others still in the mine, and\r\nafter we got Farrell out my father organized a rescuing party, and kept\r\nup the search for the imprisoned miners night and day.\r\n\r\n“John Hosie was in the mine when the fall came. He was one of the\r\nforemen, and he and my father were friends. Two days had passed in\r\nunavailing search for him, and it was thought that he must have been\r\ncrushed under the rock with the rest. But on the morning of the third\r\nday my father met him face to face in one of the desolate fallen\r\nportions of the mine. He was in darkness, he was almost exhausted, his\r\nclothing was in rags, and his fingers were torn and bleeding. When he\r\nsaw my father he could give utterance to only two words: ‘Oh, Bryden!’\r\nhe said, and then his heart failed him and he cried like a child. He\r\nhad been caught in the fall and had lost his light, and though he\r\nwas familiar with the passages of the mine he could not find his way\r\nalong them on account of the débris with which they were filled, and\r\nthe utter confusion into which everything had been thrown. He had\r\nwandered about for two days and nights in the fallen mine, clambering\r\nover jagged hills of rock, digging his way, with torn fingers, through\r\nmasses of wreckage, in constant peril from falling roof and yawning\r\npit, hungry, thirsty, and alone in the terrible darkness. What wonder\r\nthat his heart gave way in the moment of rescue!\r\n\r\n“The bodies of some of those who were shut in by the fall, or buried\r\nunder it, were found when the drift was again opened, but for others\r\nthe mine has been an undisturbed grave for more than forty years.”\r\n\r\n    NOTE ADDED IN 1898.――The latest disaster resulting from a\r\n    squeeze or fall in the mines occurred June 28, 1896, at the\r\n    Twin Shaft of The Newton Coal Mining Company at Pittston,\r\n    Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. This mine had been working for\r\n    some days, and when the fall came the Superintendent, together\r\n    with his foremen and workmen, were engaged in timbering or\r\n    propping the affected region, in order, if possible, to prevent\r\n    a fall. The effort was useless, however, and these officials\r\n    and workmen were caught while at their work, and perished\r\n    in the disaster. There were fifty-eight of them. Superhuman\r\n    efforts were put forth to rescue them, but the attempt was\r\n    useless, and later on it was found utterly impossible even to\r\n    recover their bodies, owing to the extent and magnitude of the\r\n    fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nAIR AND WATER IN THE MINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMan is an air-breathing animal. So soon as his supply of air is cut\r\noff he dies. In proportion as that supply is lessened or vitiated,\r\nhis physical and mental energies fail. One of the first requisites,\r\ntherefore, in all mining operations is that the ventilation shall be\r\ngood. To accomplish this end an air current must be established. It is\r\ntrue that into any accessible cavity atmospheric air will rush, but\r\nif it be allowed to remain in that cavity without any replacement it\r\nbecomes dead and unfit to breathe. If, in addition to this, it takes\r\nup deleterious gases, like those which escape from the coal measures,\r\nit becomes poisoned and dangerous to human life. Hence the necessity\r\nof a continuous current. Provisions for such a current are made with\r\nthe opening into every mine. The separate air compartment of a shaft\r\nhas already been noticed. In drifts, tunnels, and slopes a part of the\r\nopening is partitioned off for an airway, or, what is more common, a\r\nseparate passage is driven parallel with, and alongside of, the main\r\none. In drifts and tunnels, since the mines there are not deep, air\r\nshafts are often driven at some other point above the workings, or\r\nslopes are sunk from the outcrop to accommodate the return air from the\r\nmine. It is due to the necessity of maintaining an air current that\r\nall passages and chambers are driven in pairs or sets in the manner\r\nalready explained. It has also been explained how the fresh air going\r\nin at the carriage ways of the shaft, or other openings, passes along\r\nthe gangway to its extremity, back along the airway, up to and across\r\nthe faces of each set of chambers, and then down into the airway again,\r\nto be carried to the foot of the shaft and up by the air passage to\r\nthe surface. But in the larger mines there are many passages besides\r\nthe main gangway that must be supplied with air, and the current must\r\ntherefore be divided or split to accommodate them; so these separate\r\ncurrents, taken in this way from the main current, and themselves often\r\ndivided and subdivided, are called “splits.” The air channels thus\r\nbranching, uniting, crossing, and recrossing form a most complicated\r\nsystem of ventilation. But the current goes nowhere by chance. Every\r\ncourse is marked out for it. On the fact that it follows that given\r\npath depends the lives of the workmen and the successful operation\r\nof the mine. Sometimes it becomes necessary to carry two currents of\r\nair through the same passage in opposite directions. In that case the\r\npassage will either be partitioned along its length, or a wooden box\r\nlaid through it to conduct one of the air currents. If one air course\r\ncrosses another, as is often the case, a channel will be cut in the\r\nroof of one of the passages, and the lower side of the channel will be\r\nclosed tightly by masonry, to prevent any possible intermingling of the\r\ncurrents, a circumstance which might prove disastrous. Entrances and\r\ncross-headings cut through between parallel passages for purposes of\r\nventilation are closed as soon as the next cross-heading is made, for\r\nreasons already explained. This closing is usually done by building up\r\nin the aperture a wall of slate, rock, and coal, and filling the chinks\r\nwith dirt from the floor of the mine. Sometimes wooden partitions are\r\nput in instead, and between principal air passages the cross-headings\r\nare closed by heavy walls of masonry. When it is necessary to turn the\r\nair from any traveling way, or to prevent it from further following\r\nsuch traveling way, a partition is built across the passage, and in\r\nthe opening left in the partition a door is swung. If this is across a\r\nway through which mine cars pass, a boy will be stationed at the door\r\nto open it when the cars come and close it as soon as they have gone\r\nthrough. He is called a “door boy.” All doors are so hung as to swing\r\nopen against the current of air, and are therefore self-closing. The\r\nlaw directs that this shall be done. There are several patented devices\r\nfor giving an automatic movement to mine doors; but few if any of them\r\nare in practical operation in the anthracite mines. The conditions here\r\nare not favorable for the use of self-acting doors, and besides this\r\nthe act of 1885 provides that all main doors shall have an attendant.\r\nThe law is very explicit on this subject of ventilation; it is a matter\r\nof the utmost importance in operating a mine. A failure of the air\r\ncurrent for even an hour might, in some mines, result in the death of\r\nall those who chanced to be inside. For this current not only supplies\r\nair for breathing purposes, but it takes up the smoke, the dust, the\r\ndangerous and the poisonous gases, and carries them to the surface.\r\nIn the same way pure air is drawn into the lungs, loaded with the\r\nrefuse matter brought there by the blood, and then expelled. So life is\r\npreserved in both cases.\r\n\r\nIn order to create this circulation of air and make it continuous,\r\nartificial means are ordinarily used. The earliest method of creating\r\nan artificial air current which should be constant, and one still\r\nin use to a limited extent, is that by the open furnace. This is an\r\nordinary fireplace with grate bars, built near the foot of an opening\r\ninto the mine, and having a bricked-in smoke-flue which leads into the\r\nair passage of that opening at some little distance above the floor of\r\nthe mine. The volume of heat thus passing into the airway will rarefy\r\nthe air therein, and so create and maintain a strong, invariable,\r\nupward current. Sometimes the furnace is placed at the foot of an air\r\nshaft a long distance from the main opening, thus making it an upcast\r\nshaft. The reverse, however, is usually the case. All air that enters\r\nthe mine by any opening is usually drawn out at the main shaft or other\r\nmain entrance. But as the air returning from the working places of\r\nthe mine is often laden with inflammable gases, it is not allowed to\r\ncome into contact with the fire of the furnace, but is carried into\r\nthe shaft by a channel cut into the rock above the roof of the mine.\r\nFurnace ventilation in mines in which explosive gases are generated is\r\ndangerous at the best, and is now prohibited by the act of 1885.\r\n\r\nThe modern and most common method of creating and maintaining a\r\ncirculation of air in a mine is by a fan built at the mouth of the air\r\ncompartment of the shaft or slope. The fan exhausts the air from the\r\nmine by the airway, and fresh air rushes in by the carriage way, or\r\nany other opening to the surface to restore the equilibrium. Sometimes\r\nthe fan is used as a blower and forces air into the mine instead of\r\nexhausting it. The advantage of this method is that it gives better air\r\nto the workmen at the faces of chambers and headings, but the objection\r\nto it is that it brings all the smoke and gases out by the main\r\ngangway. This is a serious objection, not only making this principal\r\npassage unfit to see or breathe in, but making it dangerous also by the\r\npresence of inflammable gases. The fan is therefore commonly used as an\r\nexhauster.\r\n\r\nThere are various kinds of fans in use at the mines, but the kind\r\ngenerally employed is patterned after Guibal’s invention. It is simply\r\na great wheel without a rim, and instead of spokes it has blades\r\nlike those of a windmill. It is run by a steam-engine, makes forty\r\nrevolutions per minute at an average rate of speed, and sends from one\r\nhundred thousand to two hundred thousand cubic feet of fresh air per\r\nminute into the mine.\r\n\r\nThe act of 1885 requires the mine operator to furnish two hundred cubic\r\nfeet of air per minute to every man in the mine. This is the maximum\r\namount necessary for perfect respiration. In the larger workings\r\nperhaps six hundred men and boys are employed. For this number one\r\nhundred and twenty thousand cubic feet of air per minute would be\r\nrequired by law. A large fan would supply this amount by running at\r\nalmost its minimum rate of speed. So long, therefore, as the fan and\r\nair passages are in good working condition there need be no fear of\r\nlack of proper ventilation. But to give absolutely pure air to the\r\nworkers in the mine is an utter impossibility under any system that has\r\nyet been devised. The outer atmosphere that is drawn into the mines\r\nhas hardly got beyond the light of the sun before it has taken up a\r\ncertain percentage of impurities. As it passes by the working faces\r\nof the chambers it carries along with it the gases evolved from the\r\ncoal; principally the carbonic acid gas or black damp, and the light\r\ncarbureted hydrogen or fire damp. It also takes up and carries along\r\nthe powder smoke, the organic matter contained in the exhalations of\r\nmen and animals, the products of decaying timber, and the dust which\r\nis always in the air. Nor is this the only deterioration which this\r\nair current undergoes. The proportion of oxygen in it is diminished by\r\nthe burning of many lamps, by the respiration of many men, and by the\r\nconstant decay of wood. It is seen, therefore, that the air in which\r\nthe miner must breathe is far from being the pure oxygen and nitrogen\r\nof the outside atmosphere. It follows also that the longer the route is\r\nof any particular current, and the more working faces it passes in its\r\ncourse, the more heavily laden will it be with impurities, and the more\r\npoisonous for those men who last breathe it on its return to the upcast\r\nair shaft.\r\n\r\nThis evil, however, is limited in extent by the act of 1885, which\r\nprovides that no more than seventy-five persons shall be employed at\r\nthe same time in any one split or current of air.\r\n\r\nThe wonder is that the health of these mine workers does not sooner\r\nfail them, especially when we take into consideration the wet condition\r\nof many of the mines. It is a fact, however, that miners as a class are\r\nnot more subject to disease than other workmen. The decimation in their\r\nranks is due mostly to accidents producing bodily injuries and death,\r\nnot to diseases which attack them as a result of their occupation.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to the matter of ventilation in mines is the matter\r\nof drainage. The first difficulty experienced from water is while the\r\nshaft or slope is in process of sinking. It is usually necessary to\r\nhold the water in one side of the opening while work is going on in\r\nthe other side. A small pumping engine is generally sufficient to keep\r\nthe pit clear until the bottom is reached, but occasionally the amount\r\nof water is such that a large engine and pumping appliances have to be\r\nput in place at once. In Europe much trouble is often experienced from\r\nthe excessive flow of water while sinking the shaft, and a watertight\r\ncasing has frequently to follow the shaft downward in order that work\r\nmay go on at all. Such appliances are not as a rule necessary in this\r\ncountry, though much difficulty has been encountered in sinking shafts\r\nthrough the quicksand deposits of the Susquehanna basin in the Wyoming\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\nThe general principle of mine drainage has been already explained. It\r\nis, in brief, that the floor of the mine shall be so graded that all\r\nwater will gravitate to a certain point. That point is near the foot\r\nof the shaft or slope, and is at the mouth of the drift or tunnel.\r\nBut from the sump of the shaft or slope the water must be raised by\r\nartificial means. A powerful steam pumping engine, located at the\r\nsurface, is employed to do this work, and one compartment of the shaft\r\nor slope, known as the pump-way, is set aside for the accommodation\r\nof pipe, pump-rods, and supporting timbers, which extend from the top\r\nto the bottom of the shaft. The most powerful of these pumps will\r\nthrow out a volume of twelve hundred gallons of water per minute. It\r\nis seldom that the tonnage of water pumped from a mine falls below\r\nthe tonnage of coal hoisted, and in some of the wet collieries of the\r\nLehigh district eight or ten tons of water are pumped out for every ton\r\nof coal hoisted. In the Wyoming district a thousand tons of water a day\r\nis not an unusual amount to be thrown out of a mine by a single pump.\r\n\r\nIn driving gangways or chambers toward abandoned workings that have\r\nbeen allowed to fill with water much care is necessary, especially if\r\nthe new mine is on a lower level, which is usually the case. The act of\r\n1885 provides that “whenever a place is likely to contain a dangerous\r\naccumulation of water, the working approaching such place shall not\r\nexceed twelve feet in width, and there shall constantly be kept, at a\r\ndistance of not less than twenty feet in advance, at least one bore\r\nhole near the centre of the working, and sufficient flank bore holes on\r\neach side.” It often happened, before accurate surveys of mines were\r\nrequired to be made and filed, that operators would drive chambers\r\nor gangways toward these reservoirs of water in ignorance of their\r\nwhereabouts. The firing of a blast, the blow of a pick, perhaps, would\r\nso weaken the barrier pillar that it would give way and the water\r\nbreaking through would sweep into the lower workings with irresistible\r\nforce, carrying death to the workmen in its path and destruction to the\r\nmine. Some very distressing accidents have occurred in this way. It\r\nis customary now for operators, when approaching with their workings\r\na boundary line of property, to leave a barrier pillar at least one\r\nhundred feet thick between that line and the outer rib or face of their\r\nworkings; and this whether the area on the other side of the line is\r\nor is not worked out. Under the present system of accurate surveying\r\nand mapping, accidents resulting from flooding by mine water should be\r\nrare, since the location of boundary lines may be calculated almost to\r\nthe inch, as well as the location of all workings in their relation to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nBut accidents due to a flooding by surface water are not always to\r\nbe obviated. Sometimes when a stream crosses the line of outcrop the\r\nwater will break through into the mine and flood the lower levels in\r\nan incredibly short space of time; and this too when good judgment and\r\nprudence have been used in leaving sufficient coal for protection.\r\nThe continuity and character of the strata lying between the earth’s\r\nsurface and the coal face cannot always be determined. It is not often\r\nthat accidents from flooding occur while mining is going on under large\r\nbodies of water. The precautionary measures taken in presence of a\r\nknown danger are sufficient to reduce that danger to a minimum.\r\n\r\nDisasters occur occasionally as the result of a peculiarly deceptive\r\ncondition of the overlying strata, whereby a rush of earth, quicksand,\r\nor mud into a mine causes loss of life and destruction of property.\r\nThe bed of a stream cut deep into the rocks in some former geological\r\nperiod, and then filled to the level of the surrounding country\r\nwith drift in some later age, leaves a dangerous and unsuspected\r\ndepression in the strata which the miner’s drill may pierce or his\r\nblast break into at any time with disastrous results. One of the most\r\ncharacteristic of this class of accidents occurred at Nanticoke in\r\nthe Wyoming region on the 18th of December, 1885, in a mine operated\r\nby the Susquehanna Coal Company. A miner by the name of Kiveler broke\r\ninto a depression of this kind while blasting, and immediately through\r\nthe aperture a great volume of water, quicksand, and culm came rushing\r\ndown. It filled up that entire portion of the mine, burying twenty-six\r\nmen and boys beyond possible hope of rescue and endangering the lives\r\nof hundreds of others. Energetic efforts were made to tunnel through\r\nthe masses of sand and culm packed in the passages of the mine in\r\norder to reach those whose avenues of escape had been cut off, many\r\nbelieving that they had been able to reach high enough ground to escape\r\nthe flood. These efforts, lasting through many weeks, were wholly\r\nunsuccessful. The men were never reached. Bore holes, drilled into the\r\nchambers where they were imprisoned, both from the inside and from the\r\nsurface, proved conclusively that the passages were crowded full of\r\nsand and culm, and that the men must have perished immediately upon the\r\noccurrence of the disaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nTHE DANGEROUS GASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the chief dangers to which workmen in the mines are subject\r\narises from the gases given off by minerals and metals. Though these\r\ndeleterious gases are commonly found in more or less abundance in\r\nthe coal mines, and are usually considered in connection with such\r\nmines, they are, nevertheless, not confined to the coal measures.\r\nThey have been noticed also in mines of lead, sulphur, salt, and\r\nother substances. It is said that anthracite contains a much larger\r\nproportion of these gases than do bituminous or other coals, but that\r\nbeing hard it holds them more tenaciously, and is therefore worked\r\nwith less risk. The soft coals, on the contrary, being porous as well\r\nas soft, allow the gases to escape from them much more readily, and\r\nso increase the danger at the working faces of the mines. The gas\r\ngiven out most abundantly by the coal is light carbureted hydrogen,\r\nknown as marsh gas, from the fact that being a product of vegetable\r\ndecomposition under water, bubbles of it rise to the surface on\r\nstirring the waters of a marsh. This is the gas that is known to miners\r\nas fire damp. The French call it grisou. Marsh gas, in its simple\r\nform, consists of four parts of hydrogen to one of carbon. It is about\r\none half the weight of air, and therefore rises and gathers at the\r\nroof of a mine chamber, extending downward as it accumulates. When it\r\nis mixed with from four to twelve times its volume of atmospheric air\r\nit becomes violently explosive. If the mixture is above or below this\r\nproportion it is simply inflammable, burning without explosive force,\r\nwith a pale blue flame. The value of a perfect ventilating current\r\nacross the faces of chambers which are making gas rapidly can now be\r\nappreciated. It is not only necessary that the supply of air should\r\nbe sufficient to make the gas non-explosive, but that it should be\r\nsufficient to dilute it beyond even the point of inflammability. For\r\nto its inflammable more than to its explosive quality is due most of\r\nthe disasters with which it is accredited. A peculiar and dangerous\r\nfeature of this gas is that it does not always escape from the coal at\r\na uniform rate, but often comes out suddenly in large compact bodies.\r\nThese are called “blowers.” They are found most commonly in faults, in\r\ncracks in the coal seams, or in open spots in the body of coal, where\r\nthey have opportunity to accumulate. They contain, besides marsh gas,\r\nless than one per cent. of carbonic acid, and from one to four per\r\ncent. of nitrogen. It is impossible to anticipate their coming; the\r\nminer’s drill may strike into one and free it at any time without a\r\nmoment’s warning. It may even burst through the face by its own power.\r\nIn such cases danger is imminent, disaster is most common.\r\n\r\nWhen the naked light of the miner comes into contact with any\r\nconsiderable quantity of fire damp in an explosive state the shock that\r\nfollows is terrific. Men and mules, cars and coal, are hurled together\r\nto destruction. Walls are swept out, iron rails are bent double, doors\r\nare torn from their fastenings, the mine is laid waste. The damage\r\nwhich results from an explosion of gas is of course much greater than\r\nthat which is due to mere ignition and burning without the explosive\r\nforce. In the latter case, however, the danger to the miner is but\r\nslightly diminished. He is liable to receive injuries which may prove\r\nimmediately fatal. His burning lamp no sooner touches the body of fire\r\ndamp than it bursts into flame, which, propelled by expansive force,\r\npasses swiftly down along the roof of the chamber. Taking up enough\r\noxygen from the atmospheric air to make combustion more fierce, it\r\nreturns to the face of the chamber with a violent contractile surge,\r\nscorching everything in its path, and then, perhaps after another brief\r\nsally, it burns itself out.\r\n\r\nThe miner who accidentally fires a block of fire damp falls suddenly\r\nflat on his face on the floor of the mine, burying his mouth, nose,\r\nand eyes in the dirt to protect them from the flame and intense heat.\r\nThen he clasps his hands over the back of his head and neck to protect\r\nthese parts from injury, and lies waiting for the minute or two to pass\r\nbefore the fire shall have burned itself out. But he must not wait too\r\nlong. The fatal after damp follows quick upon the heels of the flame,\r\nand his only safety from certain death lies now in immediate flight.\r\n\r\nThe danger from inflammable gases was known and appreciated very early\r\nin the history of mining. But it was long thought to be an unavoidable\r\ndanger. Light must be had or no work could be done, and the only light\r\nthat could be obtained was from the flame produced by combustion.\r\nCandles were commonly used. They were stuck into a ball of clay and\r\nfastened to the sides of the working places at the most advantageous\r\npoints. The bituminous mines of England were peculiarly prolific of\r\ninflammable gases; accidents were almost of daily occurrence. On the\r\n25th of May, 1812, a great disaster occurred at Felling Colliery,\r\nnear Newcastle, in which eighty-nine persons lost their lives by\r\nexplosion of fire damp, and public attention and the public conscience\r\nwere directed to the matter of safety in mines more intensely than\r\never. Sir Humphrey Davy was then in the zenith of his fame. In April,\r\n1815, he returned to London after a triumphal tour through France and\r\nItaly, in which his progress had been marked by a series of brilliant\r\nexperiments. He had no sooner reached home than he was asked by Mr.\r\nBuddie, a well-known colliery owner of that day, to turn his attention\r\ntoward improved methods of lighting the mines. Specimens of the\r\ndangerous gas were sent to him from Newcastle, and he experimented with\r\nthem. He found that the flame from them would not pass through a small\r\ntube, nor through a set of small tubes standing side by side. He found\r\nalso that the length of the tube was immaterial. He therefore shortened\r\nthem until they were mere sections, until his set of parallel tubes\r\nbecame simply wire gauze. The proper proportion between the substance\r\nof the wire and the size of the aperture was found to be twenty-eight\r\nwires to the linear inch, and seven hundred and eighty-four apertures\r\nto the square inch, a proportion that is still in use. This wire gauze\r\nwas then made into the form of a cylindrical tube about six inches long\r\nand one and one half inches in diameter, with a flat gauze top. To the\r\nbottom of this tube was fastened a small cylindrical oil vessel, and to\r\nthe top a ring handle. The wick extended up from the oil vessel inside\r\nthe tube.\r\n\r\nWhen Sir Humphrey had perfected his lamp to a point of safety he took\r\nit and went with Mr. Buddie down to Newcastle, and together they\r\ntraversed with impunity some of the most dangerous parts of the Bentham\r\nseam, at that time one of the most fiery coal beds known. At about the\r\nsame time the celebrated George Stephenson also invented a safety lamp\r\nsimilar in most respects to the Davy, so also, later, did Clanny and\r\nMuseler, and all four kinds are in general use. Other styles have been\r\ninvented also, but for the purposes to which a safety lamp is properly\r\napplied the Davy doubtless still excels all others. Those purposes are\r\nprincipally the investigation of workings to discover the presence\r\nof gas, and to aid in the erection of proper appliances for driving\r\nit out. It is not necessary, in these days of powerful ventilating\r\nmachinery, to allow dangerous gases to remain in working places and\r\nto mine the coal there by the light of safety lamps. It is far safer,\r\nand better in every way, to sweep the chambers clean from foul air by\r\nstrong ventilating currents, so that the miner may work by the light\r\nof his naked and most convenient common tin lamp. The objection,\r\ntherefore, to the Davy lamp, that the light given out by it is too dim,\r\nneed not be considered a serious one. The size of the flame cannot be\r\nincreased without destroying the proportion between it and the gauze\r\ncylinder, and the size of the cylinder cannot be increased without\r\nmaking a dangerously large chamber for the accommodation of explosive\r\ngas. Therefore the light given out must, of necessity, be dim.\r\n\r\nBut the safety lamp itself must be used with care and prudence,\r\notherwise it may become no less an instrument of danger than the naked\r\nlamp. When it is carried into a chamber that contains fire damp the\r\ngas enters freely through the gauze into the cylindrical chamber, and\r\nis there ignited and consumed without communicating its flame to the\r\noutside body. The presence of gas is indicated by the conduct of the\r\nflame of the lamp. If the percentage of marsh gas is small the flame\r\nsimply elongates and becomes smoky. If it is mixed with from eight to\r\ntwelve or fourteen times its volume of atmospheric air the flame of\r\nthe wick disappears entirely, and the interior of the cylinder becomes\r\nfilled with the blue flame of burning gas. It will not do to hold the\r\nlamp long in this mixture, the wires will become red with heat, and the\r\nouter gas may then become ignited from them. Neither will it do to hold\r\nthe lamp in a current of gaseous air moving at a greater rate of speed\r\nthan six or eight feet per second, since in that case the flame is apt\r\nto be driven through the gauze and to set fire to the gas outside.\r\nThere is also danger if the lamp be thrust suddenly into an explosive\r\nmixture that the force of the explosion inside the wire-gauze cylinder\r\nwill force the flame through the mesh. It will be seen, therefore, that\r\neven the safety lamp is not an absolute protection against danger from\r\nexplosive and inflammable gases.\r\n\r\nThe position and duties of the fire boss at each colliery have already\r\nbeen referred to. He goes into the mine about four o’clock in the\r\nmorning and makes his round before the men arrive. If gas has been\r\nfound in an inflammable or explosive condition the workmen are not\r\nallowed to enter the place until it has been cleared out by the\r\nerection of brattices and other ventilating appliances. If only an\r\ninsignificant quantity has been found in any chamber, the miner who\r\nworks the place is warned of its existence and told to brush it out. In\r\nobedience to this order he goes to the working face, sets his lamp on\r\nthe floor, and removing his coat swings that garment vigorously over\r\nhis head, thus mixing and diluting the gas and driving it down into the\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\nIt is not in the working chambers, however, that the most dangerous\r\naccumulations of fire damp are found, but in the worked out and\r\nabandoned portions of the mine. Here it may collect unnoticed until\r\nlarge bodies of it are formed, and then when some one blunders into it\r\nwith a naked lamp a terrific explosion is the inevitable result. The\r\nact of 1885 recognizes this especial danger, and makes it obligatory\r\non operators to keep old workings free of dangerous bodies of gas; and\r\nto this end it directs that they shall be inspected at least once a\r\nweek by the fire boss or his assistant. Where it is known that such\r\ngas exists, or is liable to accumulate in old workings, the entrances\r\nto such places are barred across, and the word “Fire!” is written\r\nconspicuously at the opening to them. But notwithstanding all rules\r\nand precautions, ignitions and explosions of fire damp are still\r\ndangerously common. Among the thousands of mine workers there is always\r\nsome one who is careless, some one who blunders; the lessons of\r\nperfect watchfulness and obedience are hard lessons to be learned.\r\n\r\nAs has already been intimated, the danger which results from the\r\nburning of fire damp lies not alone in the fierce flame given forth,\r\nbut also, and perhaps in a still greater degree, in the product of its\r\ncombustion. This product is known to the miner as “after damp,” and\r\nconsists principally of carbonic acid gas with some nitrogen. It is\r\nirrespirable, and a single inhalation of it, in its pure state, will\r\nproduce immediate insensibility and speedy death. It is heavier than\r\natmospheric air and therefore falls to the bottom of the mine as soon\r\nas it is formed from the combustion of the light carbureted hydrogen.\r\nIt is for this reason that the miner, who has fallen on his face on the\r\nfloor of the mine to escape the flame of the burning fire damp, rises\r\nas soon as that flame has disappeared and hastens, if he is able, to a\r\nplace of safety. Indeed, it is easier to protect one’s self from the\r\nsurging fire above than from the invisible and insidious gas below, so\r\nquickly does it form, so deadly is it in effect.\r\n\r\nOne of the most characteristic disasters of recent times, resulting\r\nfrom the explosion of fire damp and the accumulation of after damp,\r\noccurred on Monday, August 14, 1871, at the Eagle Shaft, situated about\r\na mile below the town of Pittston, in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania.\r\nAt nine o’clock on the morning of that day a driver boy by the name\r\nof Martin Mangan was passing along an upper gangway, driving a mule\r\nwith a trip of mine cars. Just above him lay a section of the mine\r\nthat had been worked out and abandoned, in the old chambers of which\r\na large body of fire damp had been allowed to accumulate. At the hour\r\nmentioned there came a sudden and extensive fall of roof in these old\r\nworkings. The impulse given to the air by this fall drove it out into\r\nthe working galleries, and with it the inflammable gas. When the fire\r\ndamp reached the heading and touched the flame of Martin Mangan’s\r\nlighted lamp there was a terrific explosion. At the mouth of the shaft\r\ntimbers were cracked, clouds of dust poured out, and débris from the\r\nmine was thrown violently into the outer air. People who were a mile\r\naway heard the noise of the explosion and hastened to the scene. Mining\r\nexperts knew at once what had occurred. As soon as sufficient repairs\r\ncould be made to the shaft a rescuing party, led by Superintendent\r\nAndrew Bryden of the Pennsylvania Coal Company’s mines, descended into\r\nthe mine and began to search for victims. Those workmen who were on\r\nthe other side of the shaft from where the explosion took place were\r\nrescued and brought out alive. But little progress could be made,\r\nhowever, toward the region of the trouble on account of the after damp\r\nwhich had accumulated. Up to two o’clock on Tuesday morning five dead\r\nbodies had been discovered, and during that day twelve more were taken\r\nout; all who had worked in that section of the mine. The positions of\r\nthese bodies showed that the men had fallen where they chanced to be\r\nwhen the explosion occurred. The first wave of after damp that touched\r\nthem had made them insensible, and death speedily followed. They died\r\nfrom asphyxia.\r\n\r\n“Black damp” is pure carbonic acid gas, containing two parts of oxygen\r\nto one of carbon. It is the principal constituent of after damp, which\r\nmay, indeed, contain no other elements in appreciable quantities. The\r\ntwo mixtures are therefore often spoken of as being the same, and the\r\nminers apply the term “choke damp” indiscriminately to either.\r\n\r\nBlack damp is also given off by the coal in the same manner that fire\r\ndamp is, and frequently the two mixtures are evolved together. Carbonic\r\nacid gas is also one of the products of burning coal, of burning oil,\r\nand of the respiration of man and beast. It is about one and a half\r\ntimes as heavy as air, and is therefore always found next to the floor\r\nof the mine. This gas is not inflammable. Its presence may be detected\r\nby the conduct of the flame of the lamp. In an atmosphere containing\r\nbut a small percentage of it the lamp light will grow dim, and, as the\r\nproportion of gas increases, will become more and more feeble until\r\nit is finally extinguished. An atmosphere containing from eight to\r\nten per cent. of this gas may be breathed without immediate danger;\r\nit will simply occasion dullness of intellect and numbness of body.\r\nThis condition changes into one of insensibility as the inhalation\r\ncontinues, or as the percentage of gas is increased, and to enter an\r\nundiluted body of it means sudden death. It is stated that the workmen\r\nin the Creuzot mine, in France, descended the shaft one morning,\r\non their way to work, not knowing that carbonic acid had formed in\r\nthe mine during the night. Following one after another along the\r\nmain passage, they had reached a point not far from the foot of the\r\nshaft when the leader suddenly entered into a body of black damp and\r\nfell, stricken with asphyxia, before he could utter a cry. The man\r\nfollowing him fell also. The third, bending over to draw his comrade\r\nout of danger, was himself prostrated, and the fourth, by reason of a\r\nsimilar effort, shared the fate of the others. But the fifth, being\r\nan experienced master miner, turned quickly in his tracks and obliged\r\nthose behind him to ascend the shaft. The black damp is thus quick\r\nand terrible in its effect. The greatest danger from it, however,\r\nexists, not at the working faces, where it is usually swept away in\r\nthe ventilating current, but in abandoned workings, where it often\r\naccumulates unnoticed.\r\n\r\n“White damp” is a more dangerous gas than either of the others, but\r\nis not so frequently found. It is carbonic oxide, and consists of\r\nequal portions of carbon and oxygen. It is a very little lighter than\r\nair, and has a tendency to rise. When present in a sufficiently pure\r\nstate it burns with a blue flame, but ordinarily it is incombustible\r\nand produces no effect upon the flame of the lamp. It is tasteless\r\nand odorless, and its presence cannot be detected before it has done\r\nits dangerous work. To breathe an atmosphere containing a very small\r\npercentage of it will speedily produce a fatal result. It acts on the\r\nsystem as a narcotic, and its effect is produced even more quickly than\r\nis that of black damp. It is not thought to be given off in appreciable\r\nquantities by the coal at the open faces; but it is formed when the\r\ncarbonic acid passes through any ignited carbonaceous material, or\r\nwhen steam passes over burning coal. It is therefore produced most\r\nfrequently by smouldering gob fires, by burning wood in the mines, or\r\nby a shaft on fire, and may exist as one of the results of an explosion\r\nof fire damp or of blasting powder. It is the most to be dreaded of any\r\nof the gases which the miner has to encounter. He may possibly avoid\r\nthe surging flame of the fire damp, he may escape from the falling\r\nafter damp, and make his way unharmed through bodies of black damp\r\nlying thick about his feet, but if he has still to encounter this\r\nterrible white damp his good fortune will have been of little avail;\r\ndeath will almost surely seize him.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this may be mentioned the fact that under certain\r\nconditions coal dust may become violently explosive. When it is mixed\r\nwith air, with or without the presence of fire damp, and is set into\r\nsudden and intense vibration by a heavy powder blast, a fall of roof,\r\nor other means, it may explode with greater destructive force than even\r\nfire damp is capable of. Happily such explosions are not frequent, all\r\nthe conditions necessary being rarely present at the same time. It is\r\nobvious, moreover, that an accident of this kind could occur only in\r\na very dry mine. It is true also that the dust of bituminous coals is\r\nmuch more liable to be explosive than the dust of anthracite. No well\r\nauthenticated instances of coal dust explosions have been reported\r\nfrom the anthracite regions, while in mining soft coals they have\r\nundoubtedly occurred. Two cases of this kind were reported from France,\r\none in 1875 and one in 1877. No longer ago than November 9, 1888, a\r\nterrible explosion of coal dust occurred in a bituminous coal mine at\r\nPittsburg, Kansas, by which more than one hundred lives were lost.\r\n\r\nIn some mines the inflammable and poisonous gases are given off in such\r\nabundance by the coal that it is dangerous to remain in them for even\r\nan hour after ventilation has been stopped. At such collieries when, on\r\naccount of accident, or for any reason, the fan stops running, the men\r\nare called out immediately, and are not allowed to enter again until a\r\nnew circulating current has been established. One of the most notable\r\nmine disasters of recent years was caused by the quick accumulation\r\nof black damp and white damp in a mine, the ventilating system of\r\nwhich had been destroyed and the shaft burned out by fire. This was at\r\nAvondale, near Plymouth, in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, on the 6th\r\nof September, 1869. There were three conditions here, the presence and\r\ncoöperation of which made this calamity possible. First, the mine was\r\nventilated by a furnace at the foot of the shaft; second, the breaker\r\nwas built over the mouth of the shaft; and, third, the shaft was the\r\nonly outlet from the mine. The partition of the ventilating flue took\r\nfire from the furnace draught. At ten o’clock in the forenoon a young\r\nman by the name of Palmer Steele stepped on the carriage with a load of\r\nhay to take to the inside stables. Half way down the shaft the hay took\r\nfire from the burning buntons. The engineer saw the flames rise from\r\nthe mouth and let the carriage, with the young man on it, as quickly\r\nas possible to the bottom. There were then in the mine one hundred and\r\neight men. Not one of them came out from it alive. In an incredibly\r\nshort space of time the flames leaped to the top of the breaker, one\r\nhundred feet from the ground, and by the middle of the afternoon the\r\ngreat building was a mass of ruins, covering over and blocking up\r\nthe only entrance to the mine. It was far into the night before the\r\ndébris had been sufficiently cleared away to permit of descent into the\r\nshaft. Then two men, Thomas W. Williams and David Jones, went down to\r\nsearch for the imprisoned miners. They were scarcely beyond the foot\r\nof the shaft when they stumbled into a body of white damp and were\r\nstricken with death. The fire occurred on Monday. It was not until ten\r\no’clock Tuesday morning that a sufficient ventilating current had been\r\nestablished to make it safe for men to descend. The greatest distance\r\nthat it was possible to go from the foot of the shaft on Tuesday was\r\nseventy-five feet. Beyond that point the danger from suffocation was\r\nstill imminent. Only three bodies had been thus far found.\r\n\r\nWednesday morning a rescuing party went up the plane at some distance\r\nfrom the foot of the shaft, and at the head of the plane they found a\r\nbarrier across the gangway. It had been formed by placing a mine car in\r\nposition and packing the space between it and the walls with clothing\r\nand refuse. This barrier was broken down, but there was no one behind\r\nit. Later another party was able to go a little farther, and came to\r\na second barrier. Outside of this lay the dead body of John Bowen. He\r\nhad come out for some purpose from behind the barricade, leaving open\r\nan aperture through which to crawl back, but before he could do so he\r\nhad died from asphyxia. This barrier was broken down, and behind it\r\nlay the victims, one hundred and five of them, all dead, suffocated\r\nby the foul gases of the mine. The story of their experiences, their\r\nstruggles, their sufferings, can never be known.\r\n\r\nThe disaster which occurred at the West Pittston mine on May 27, 1871,\r\nwas similar in many respects to that at Avondale. In this case also the\r\nbreaker, built over the shaft, the only opening to the mine, took fire\r\nand burned to the ground, closing the avenue of escape to thirty-six\r\nmen and boys. These prisoners shut themselves into a chamber, building\r\na barricade across the foot of it to keep out the foul gases; but when\r\nthe rescuing party broke in to them on the following day fourteen of\r\nthem were found dead and the rest were unconscious. Of those who were\r\nbrought out alive four died soon after reaching the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ANTHRACITE COAL BREAKER.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the act of 1885 it is provided that “no inflammable structure other\r\nthan a frame to sustain pulleys or sheaves shall be erected over the\r\nentrance of any opening connecting the surface with the underground\r\nworkings of any mine, and no breaker or other inflammable structure\r\nfor the preparation or storage of coal shall be erected nearer than\r\ntwo hundred feet to any such opening.” This was for the purpose of\r\npreventing, if possible, such lamentable disasters as those of Avondale\r\nand West Pittston. The results of this legislation in providing greater\r\nsecurity to the employees in mines is invaluable. Formerly it had\r\nbeen the custom to build not only the shaft-house over the opening\r\ninto the mine, but the breaker itself, wherever there was one, was\r\nusually erected over the mouth of the shaft. This was convenient and\r\neconomical, since the coal could be hoisted directly from the mine to\r\nthe top of the breaker, without the delay of a horizontal transfer at\r\nthe surface of the earth. Many of the shaft houses and breakers that\r\nhad thus been built at the time of the passage of the act are still\r\nin operation, and will so remain until the time of their utility is\r\npassed. But all new buildings are erected in accordance with the law.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SLOAN COAL BREAKER, HYDE PARK, PA.]\r\n\r\nAt the mouth of the shaft heavy upright timbers are set up, inclosing\r\nthe opening. These are united by cross-beams, and the whole structure\r\nis well braced. In this head-frame are set the sheaves, at a distance\r\nfrom the ground of from thirty to fifty feet, although, when the entire\r\nsurface plant was under one cover, they were set much lower. These\r\nsheaves are huge upright wheels sixteen feet in diameter, over which\r\nthe ropes pass that connect with the cages. A sheave similar in form to\r\nthe bicycle wheel is now coming rapidly into use; it is found to bear a\r\ngreater strain in comparison with its weight than does any other form.\r\n\r\nThe hoisting engine must be in the immediate vicinity of the shaft, and\r\nthe rooms for this and the boiler, furnace, and pump are usually all\r\nunder one roof. The iron or steel wire ropes extend from the sheaves\r\nin the head frame to the drum in the engine-room, around which they\r\nare coiled in such a manner that as one is being wound up the other is\r\nbeing unwound. Therefore as one carriage ascends the other descends by\r\nvirtue of the same movement of the engine.\r\n\r\nSince the breaker may receive coal from two or more openings it must be\r\nso located as to be convenient to both or all of them. If the ground\r\nslopes sufficiently the breaker may be so built that its head will be\r\non a level with the head of the shaft. This will save breaker hoisting.\r\nWhen coal is brought out by a slope the track and grade of the slope\r\nare usually continued, by an open trestlework, from the mouth of the\r\nopening to the head of the breaker. Wherever it is possible to do so,\r\nthe loaded cars are run by gravity from the mouth of the opening to the\r\nbreaker, and the empty ones are drawn back by mules. Sometimes they\r\nare hauled both ways by mules, and sometimes a small steam locomotive\r\nengine is employed to draw them back and forth.\r\n\r\nThe coal breaker is an institution that is peculiar to the anthracite\r\ncoal fields of Pennsylvania. Its need was made manifest early in the\r\nhistory of anthracite mining, its development was rapid, and it has now\r\ncome to be wholly indispensable in the preparation of anthracite coal\r\nfor the market. It is very seldom indeed that one sees this coal in the\r\nshape and size in which it was mined. All anthracite coal for domestic\r\nuse is now broken, screened, and separated into grades of uniform size\r\nbefore being placed upon the market, and this work is done in the coal\r\nbreakers.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the year 1844 these breakers were unknown. Several\r\nexperiments had been made in the matter of breaking coal by machinery,\r\nbut there had been no practical results, and the breaking still\r\ncontinued to be done by hand. In that year, however, a breaker after\r\nthe modern plan was erected at the mines of Gideon Bast, in Schuylkill\r\nCounty, by J. & S. Battin of Philadelphia. It was started on the 28th\r\nof February, 1844. There were two cast-iron rollers in it, each about\r\nthirty inches long and thirty inches in diameter, and on the surface\r\nof these rollers were set iron teeth or projections about two and one\r\nhalf inches long and four inches from centre to centre. These rollers\r\nwere placed horizontally, side by side, and were so geared that, as\r\nthey revolved, their upper surfaces turned toward each other, and the\r\nteeth on one roller were opposite to the spaces on the other. These\r\nrolls were afterward improved by being perforated between the teeth,\r\nthus presenting less of solid surface to the coal, and causing less\r\ncrushing. Another set of rollers was afterward added, being placed\r\nabove the first set, and having the teeth larger and wider apart,\r\nso that large lumps of coal might first be broken into pieces small\r\nenough to be crushed readily by the lower set. After the perfecting\r\nof the rolls came the perfecting of the screens for the purpose of\r\nseparating the broken coal into grades according to size. Before the\r\nintroduction of coal breakers a hand screen was used. This screen was\r\nset in a frame, was cylindrical in form, and was slightly inclined from\r\nthe horizontal. It was turned by a crank at one end, in the manner of\r\na grindstone. The screen placed in the breaker was of much the same\r\npattern, except that instead of being from five to eight feet long the\r\nlength was increased to twenty feet, and the diameter correspondingly\r\nenlarged. Mr. Henry Jenkins of Pottsville then invented a method of\r\nweaving thick wire into screen plates about three feet wide, having\r\nthe proper curve. These curved plates being joined together formed the\r\nnecessary hollow cylinder. These separate plates are called jackets,\r\nand when one of them wears out it may be taken from the cylinder and\r\nreplaced, with but little trouble and delay. The screen is set in heavy\r\nframework, and is inclined slightly from the horizontal. The first\r\nsegment at the upper end of the screen is made of wire woven into a\r\nmesh so fine that only the smallest particles of coal will pass through\r\nit; the mesh of the next segment is larger, and that of the next larger\r\nstill. The screen may contain from two to five segments in its length.\r\nNow the coal, being poured in on top of the revolving rolls, comes out\r\nfrom under them broken into small pieces, and passes immediately into\r\nthe upper or highest end of the hollow cylindrical screen as it would\r\npass into a barrel. But, as the screen revolves on its axis, the finer\r\nparticles of coal fall out through the fine mesh of the first segment,\r\nand are carried away in an inclined trough, while the rest of the coal\r\nslides on to the next segment. Here the next smallest particles fall\r\nthrough and are carried away, and the process is continued until the\r\nlower end of the screen is reached, out of which end all the coal that\r\nwas too large to pass through the mesh of the last segment is now\r\npoured. It will be seen that by this means the different sizes of coal\r\nhave been separated from each other and can be carried by separate\r\nshutes to the loading place. This is the principle of the rolls and\r\nscreens which are the main features of every coal breaker, though each\r\nbreaker usually contains two or more sets of rolls and from eight to\r\ntwelve screens. The Woodward breaker recently erected near Kingston,\r\nPennsylvania, has six pairs of rollers and twenty screens. Some of\r\nthese screens are double; that is, they have a larger outside screen\r\nsurrounding the smaller one, and the coal that passes through the inner\r\nscreen is caught by the outer one and again divided by means of a\r\nsmaller mesh.\r\n\r\nBefore the days of breakers and screens coal was sent to market in\r\nthe lump, as it came from the mine, and it was generally broken and\r\nprepared for use by the consumer. But when the separation of coal in\r\nthe breaker became reduced to a system, the four smaller sizes than\r\nlump coal were soon graded. They were known as steamboat, egg, stove,\r\nand chestnut. It was thought at the time that no finer grade of coal\r\nthan chestnut could be burned to advantage. But it was not long before\r\na smaller size, known as pea coal, was separated, placed on the market,\r\nand readily sold; and now, within recent years, another still smaller\r\nsize called buckwheat has been saved from the refuse and has come into\r\ngeneral use. Everything smaller than this is culm and goes to the waste\r\npile. The names of the different sizes of marketable coal and the\r\nspaces over and through which they pass in the process of separation\r\nare given in the following table, taken from Saward’s “Coal Trade\r\nAnnual,” for 1888:――\r\n\r\n    ───────────────────┬──────────┬──────────\r\n                       │   OVER.  │  THROUGH.\r\n                       │  Inches. │  Inches.\r\n    ───────────────────┼──────────┼──────────\r\n    Lump coal     bars │ 4½ to 9  │\r\n    Steamboat      “   │ 3½ to 5  │  7\r\n    Broken        mesh │ 2⅜ to 2⅞ │ 3¼ to 4½\r\n    Egg            “   │ 1¾ to 2¼ │ 2⅜ to 2⅞\r\n    Large stove    “   │ 1¼ to 1⅞ │ 1¾ to 2¼\r\n    Small stove    “   │ 1  to 1¼ │ 1¼ to 1½\r\n    Chestnut       “   │  ⅝ to  ¾ │ 1  to 1¼\r\n    Pea            “   │  ⅜ to  ⅝ │  ⅝ to  ⅞\r\n    Buckwheat      “   │³∕₁₆ to  ⅜ │  ⅜ to  ⅝\r\n    Dirt           “   │          │³∕₁₆ to  ⅜\r\n    ───────────────────┴──────────┴──────────\r\n\r\nThe necessity which controls the form and construction of the breaker\r\nbuilding is that the unbroken and unscreened coal must first be\r\ntaken to a point in the building sufficiently high to allow of its\r\npassage, by gradual descent, with slow movement, through successive\r\nrolls, screens, shutes, and troughs until, thoroughly broken and fully\r\ncleaned and separated, it reaches the railroad cars, standing under\r\nthe pockets, and is loaded into them for shipment. It is sometimes\r\npossible, as has already been intimated, to locate a breaker on the\r\nside of a hill so that the coal may be run into the head of it from the\r\nmine by a surface track without the necessity of hoisting. In this case\r\nthe building will hug the hill, extending for a long distance down the\r\nslope of it, but without rising at any point to a great height from\r\nthe surface of the ground. In these days, however, the breaker is more\r\nfrequently erected in the valley. The general results are thought to be\r\nbetter, and the special convenience to railroad outlets to market is\r\ncertainly greater. Besides this, the necessities of the case in shaft\r\nmining seem to demand it.\r\n\r\nA peculiar and characteristic feature of a breaker so built is the\r\ngreat vertical height to which one portion of the building is run\r\nup. This is the portion that contains the shaft up which the coal is\r\nhoisted, and from the top of which it starts on its long descending\r\nroute to the surface again. From one hundred to one hundred and fifty\r\nfeet is not an unusual height for this portion of the building. From\r\nthis topmost part of the structure the roof slopes down by stages, on\r\none or two sides, widening out, running off at an angle to cover a\r\nwing, spreading by a projection here and there until, by the time the\r\nlast ten feet in height are reached, the ground space covered by the\r\nbuilding has come to be very great. Under the last or lowest portion\r\nof the structure are the railroad sidings on which the cars stand to\r\nbe loaded from the many pockets in which the shutes have terminated.\r\nTwo engines are necessary at the breaker, one a winding engine to\r\nhoist coal from the surface to the top of the breaker, and the other a\r\nbreaker engine to move the rolls, screens, and other breaker machinery.\r\nThe winding engine is usually put on the opposite side of the shaft\r\ntower from the rolls and screens, and the ropes from it, either exposed\r\nor under cover of a long sloping roof, reach up to the sheaves in the\r\nhead frame. The breaker engine is usually housed in a wing at one\r\nside of the main building, while the several nests of boilers, under\r\na separate cover, are required by the act of 1885 to be at least one\r\nhundred feet away from the breaker.\r\n\r\nNo one, having once seen and examined an anthracite coal breaker, could\r\never mistake one for a building erected for any other purpose. These\r\nbreakers have a character peculiarly their own. They are the most\r\nprominent features in the landscape of every anthracite coal region,\r\nwhere they tower up black, majestic, many-winged, and many-windowed, in\r\nthe range of almost every outlook.\r\n\r\nWhen the mine car full of coal is hoisted to the head of the breaker it\r\nis run by two headmen from the carriage across the scale platform to\r\nthe dump shute bars on to which it is dumped. These are long, sloping,\r\nparallel iron bars, set two and one half inches apart. The dirt and all\r\nthe coal that is small enough falls through these bars into a hopper,\r\nfrom which it is fed into a pair of screens, one on each side. These\r\nseparate the dirt in the manner already described, and divide the clean\r\ncoal into sizes smaller than, and including, egg. Each size as it falls\r\nthrough the segment of, or out at the end of, the screen, is caught in\r\na separate shute and carried to a second set of revolving screens where\r\nit is again cleaned and separated, passing from these screens into the\r\npicking shutes. All the shutes or troughs in which the coal is carried\r\nhave a sufficient inclination to make the material move by gravity,\r\nand, to decrease the amount of friction, the bottom and sides of each\r\nshute are lined with sheet iron. The large coals which passed over the\r\ndump shute bars now slide down to a second set of bars, set four and\r\none half inches apart, called steamboat bars; all coal falling through\r\nthese being separated by still a third set of bars into steamboat and\r\negg, and eventually finding its way to the picking shutes or to the\r\nrolls which break the prepared coal. All coal which passed over the\r\nsteamboat bars is lump coal, and, after having the slate and bony coal\r\nremoved from it by hand as it passes, is carried into the lump-coal\r\nshute and sent down to the loading place; or else it is carried, by\r\nanother shute, into the heavy rolls and crushed. As it emerges,\r\nbroken, from these rolls, it passes into revolving screens, and the\r\nsame process of screening and separating goes on that has been already\r\ndescribed in the case of coal falling through the first or dump-shute\r\nbars. But all this broken, screened, and separated coal finds its way\r\neventually into the picking shutes. These are narrow troughs down which\r\nthe separate grades of coal pass slowly in shallow streams. Across the\r\ntop of each trough, at two or more points in its route through the\r\npicking-room, narrow seats are placed on which boys sit facing up the\r\nshute. These boys are called slate pickers. It is their duty to pick\r\nout the pieces of slate, stone, or bone, from the stream of coal which\r\npasses under them, and throw this refuse into a trough at the side of\r\nthe shute, from which point it slides rapidly away. The coal as it\r\ncomes from the mine is full of waste material, so that the boy who\r\nsits first or highest on the shute has no trouble in finding plenty to\r\ndo, and, work as hard as he may, much of the unfit material must still\r\nescape him. The boy who sits below him on the shute is able to give the\r\npassing stream a closer inspection and more careful treatment, and,\r\nshould there be one still below, he must have sharp eyes and skillful\r\nfingers to detect worthless pieces that have been left by his comrades.\r\nThe boys often put their feet in the shute and dam the coal back for\r\na moment to give them time to throw out the abundance of slate that\r\nthey may see, but no matter how careful they are, nor how many hands\r\nthe coal may pass through in the picking process, a certain percentage\r\nof slate and bone is sure to remain. The slate pickers are not all\r\nstationed in one room, though the picking-room usually holds the\r\ngreater number of them. They are put at the shutes in any part of the\r\nbreaker where their services may be useful or necessary. Indeed, there\r\nare pickers who sit at the refuse shutes to pick out the pieces of good\r\ncoal which have been inadvertently thrown in by the other pickers. In\r\nsome breakers the coal passes from the shute across a gently sloping\r\nplatform, by the side of which the boy sits to pick out the waste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCREEN-ROOM IN BREAKER, SHOWING SCREEN AND SHUTES.]\r\n\r\nBut the time is undoubtedly coming when the occupation of the picker\r\nboy will be gone. The inventive genius of the age has already devised\r\nmachinery which does its work faster, better, and with greater\r\ncertainty than the most conscientious breaker boy could hope to do it.\r\nThe great collieries are, one by one, adopting the new methods, and the\r\narmy of breaker boys is gradually but surely decreasing.\r\n\r\nNearly all the slate-picking machines are based on the fact that the\r\nspecific gravity of coal is lighter than that of slate or stone. One\r\nmethod brings the principle of friction into play. A section, a few\r\nfeet in length, of the floor of the shute down which the coal passes\r\nis made of stone. At the end of this stone section is a narrow slot\r\ncut in the floor, crosswise of the shute, and beyond the slot the iron\r\nbottom is continued as before. Now when the shallow stream of broken\r\ncoal strikes the stone bottom the friction between that bottom and\r\nthe pieces of slate and stone is so great that these particles are\r\nimpeded in their progress, and by the time they reach the slot they\r\nhave not impetus enough to cross it and must therefore drop into it and\r\nbe carried away. But the friction between coal and stone is slight in\r\ncomparison, and the pieces of coal retain enough of their impetus to\r\ncarry them safely across the slot and on down the shute. This is not a\r\nperfect separation, and the coal and slate which it divides has usually\r\nto be looked over again, to insure satisfactory results. The best and\r\nmost practicable invention thus far brought into use is that of Mr.\r\nCharles W. Ziegler, picker boss at the Von Storch colliery, Scranton.\r\nThis machine acts somewhat upon the method last described, though by\r\na system of rollers, levers, and screens in connection with it and\r\nattached to it, it is able to make quite perfect separation of the coal\r\nand slate. Two or three of these machines placed on a single shute\r\nshould do the work required of them very thoroughly.\r\n\r\nThe experience of domestic buyers of coal would seem to indicate,\r\neither that the picker boys do not do their whole duty or that the\r\npicking machines have not yet been made perfect. But it must be\r\nremembered that the separation of slate and bony coal from good\r\nmaterial is made only in a rough and general way in the mine, and that\r\na very large percentage of the output, as it reaches the breaker,\r\nis unfit for use. To clean and separate this material thoroughly,\r\ntherefore, requires much labor, and extreme care and skill.\r\n\r\nAfter these separate streams of coal have passed the scrutiny of the\r\npicker boys or the test of the picking machine, the shutes in which\r\nthey run are narrowed into pockets or bins, closed at the end by a\r\ngate. The pocket projects over the car track high enough from it for a\r\nrailroad coal car to stand beneath, and the coal is then fed from the\r\npocket into the car at will.\r\n\r\nThere is also a loading place for the rock and slate which have been\r\nseparated from the coal on its way through the breaker; and there are\r\ntwo or three points where the coal dirt is gathered from its pockets\r\nto be taken away. All this refuse is run out by separate tracks to a\r\nconvenient distance from the breaker and there dumped.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that sixteen per cent. of the material which goes\r\ninto the breaker to be prepared comes out as waste, and is sent to\r\nthe refuse dump. It can readily be supposed, therefore, that in the\r\ncourse of a few years these waste heaps will grow to an enormous size;\r\nand as a matter of fact they do. The dirt or culm, which includes all\r\nmaterial finer than buckwheat coal, is usually dumped on a separate\r\npile from the rock, slate, and bony coal, since it is not wholly\r\nwithout at least prospective value. It has been used frequently in\r\nthe coal regions to fill in beneath railroad tracks supported by\r\ntrestle-work, and it is valuable as a foundation on which to lay\r\nstone flagging for footwalks, since it does not yield readily to\r\nthe action of frost. Culm has also been utilized by adding to it a\r\ncertain percentage of mucilaginous or pitchy material and compressing\r\nit into bricks for fuel. In some European countries a large amount of\r\nwaste is burned in this way, but in America the cost of preparation\r\nis still too great to permit of competition with prepared anthracite.\r\nThe most characteristic feature of scenery in the anthracite coal\r\nregions, aside from the breakers themselves, is the presence of these\r\ngreat, bare, black hills of culm, shining in the sunlight, smoothly\r\nwhite under the snows of winter. Sometimes these culm banks take fire,\r\neither spontaneously or as the result of carelessness or accident. If\r\nthe pile is near enough to the breaker to menace it, or near enough\r\nto an outcrop to carry combustion into the coal of the mine, the fire\r\nmust be extinguished, and this is sometimes done with much labor and\r\nat great expense. If no danger is apprehended, the fire is allowed to\r\nsmoulder until it burns out, a process which may take months or even\r\nyears, during which time little blue flames flicker on the surface of\r\nthe bank, the sky above it is tinged with red at night, and the whole\r\nblack hillside is finally covered with great blotches of white ash. To\r\nthe poor people who live in the vicinity of the breakers these heaps\r\nof refuse coal are an unmixed blessing. Pieces of good coal are always\r\nbeing thrown out inadvertently with the waste, and the bony coal that\r\nis discarded is not by any means without value as a fuel; indeed it\r\nmakes a very respectable fire. So, too, one can obtain, with a screen,\r\nfrom the culm heap quite a little percentage of material that will\r\nburn. Thus it comes about that every day women and children and old\r\nmen go to these black hills with hammer and screen and gather fuel for\r\ntheir fires, and carry it home in bags, or wheelbarrows, or little\r\nhandcarts. It is the old story over again of the gleaners in the field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nIN THE BITUMINOUS COAL MINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA brief history of the discovery and introduction into use of the\r\nbituminous coals of Pennsylvania has already been given; but only\r\ncasual reference has been made to the methods of mining in the\r\nbituminous regions. It is true that of the one hundred and twenty\r\nthousand square miles of workable coal beds in the United States less\r\nthan five hundred square miles are of anthracite coal. It is true,\r\nalso, that more than two thirds of the coal produced in the United\r\nStates during the year 1887 was of the bituminous variety, and that\r\nthe income from bituminous coal during that year was nearly twice as\r\nmuch as the income from anthracite. Yet it is obvious that in any\r\ndescription of coal mining methods the anthracite mines should be\r\nused as the chief examples. This is not only because of the greater\r\ncommercial importance of anthracite, and of its greater familiarity\r\nas a domestic fuel, but it is principally because of the far greater\r\nskill, judgment, and ingenuity required in mining it and preparing it\r\nfor market. In the bituminous regions the coal is soft, lies flat and\r\nnear the surface, and is mined by the simplest methods. The reader\r\nis already familiar with some of the complications, obstacles, and\r\nproblems that meet and beset the operator in the anthracite regions,\r\nand with the great labor, vast expenditures, and high degree of skill\r\nnecessary to reach, take out, and prepare the anthracite coal. In\r\nview of these facts no excuse is necessary for attaching the greater\r\nimportance to the description of methods in the anthracite region. But\r\na brief outline of the systems in vogue at the bituminous mines will\r\nnot be uninteresting, so far at least as they differ from those in use\r\nat the anthracite mines.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1887 a little more than one third of the bituminous\r\ncoal output of the United States came from the Pennsylvania mines.\r\nPittsburgh is the centre of the soft coal trade of that state, and\r\nthe principal coal seam of the region is known as the “Pittsburgh\r\nbed.” It is included in an area about fifty miles square, and varies\r\nin thickness from two or three feet in the northwestern part, and six\r\nfeet at Pittsburgh, to ten feet up the Monongahela River, and twelve\r\nfeet up the Youghiogeny. The exhaustion of so vast a coal bed is a\r\npractical impossibility, and the questions that engage the attention of\r\nthe mining engineer in these regions are not so much questions of the\r\neconomy of coal as they are questions of the economy of labor. The coal\r\nlies near the surface, and the outcrops on the flanks of the hills and\r\nbanks of the rivers are so numerous that most of the mining can be,\r\nand is, done by drift above water level. The outlay of capital required\r\nin opening a mine is therefore very small, marketable coal being\r\nobtained at almost the first blow of the pick.\r\n\r\nBefore mining operations are begun a complete survey is made of all\r\noutcroppings, and their differences in level are obtained. From this\r\ndata a comparatively accurate knowledge may be had of the position of\r\nthe coal bed under ground, as the dip of the seams is very moderate and\r\nuniform, and but few faults and other irregularities are encountered.\r\nIt is then decided where to locate the mouth of the drift so that the\r\nentry can be driven in on the rise of the coal and the mine become\r\nself-draining. It is important, however, to have the opening at a\r\nconvenient point near the river or railroad, and it is usually so made\r\nif possible, even though the dip should be away from the opening.\r\nThe inclination is always so slight as not to interfere greatly with\r\nthe hauling of cars, and it is not much of a task to make a separate\r\nopening for drainage. The coal seam is divided by vertical cleavage\r\nplanes, running at right angles to each other, one of which is known\r\nas the _butt_ cleavage and the other as the _face_ cleavage. The\r\nmain entries are driven in, if possible, on the face cleavage, as\r\nare also the chambers, or “rooms” as they are called here; while the\r\nentries from which the rooms are turned are always driven on the butt\r\ncleavage. The drift, or main entry, has an airway running parallel\r\nwith it; sometimes it has one on each side of it. It is driven eight\r\nor nine feet in width, except where two tracks are necessary, in which\r\ncase it is made from twelve to fifteen feet wide. These double or\r\ntreble entries are parallel to each other, and are separated by a wall\r\nof coal from twenty-five to forty feet in width. Through this wall,\r\nat about every thirty yards, entrances, or, as they are called here,\r\n“break-throughs,” are made, having the same width as the entry. The\r\nheight of roof in the entries of the Pittsburgh seam is usually five\r\nand one half or six feet in the clear. At right angles to the main\r\nentry butt entries are driven in pairs, parallel to each other and\r\nabout thirty or forty feet apart, with break-throughs or cross-cuts\r\nfor the passage of air, as on the main entries. From each of these\r\nbutt entries, at right angles to them, and in opposite directions,\r\nthe rooms are driven. They are made about twenty-one feet wide, with\r\npillars between them twelve feet thick, and are not often more than\r\neighty yards in length. They are usually driven to meet the faces of\r\nthe rooms which are being worked from the next parallel butt entry, or\r\nare extended to that butt entry itself. At the point where the room\r\nturns off from the butt entry it is made only seven feet wide for a\r\ndistance of from fifteen to twenty-one feet, then the room is widened\r\nout to its full width of twenty-one feet. The track on which the mine\r\nwagon runs is laid straight up the side of the room from the opening\r\nat the entry, occupying a clear space about seven feet wide. The rest\r\nof the room is well filled with the refuse which has been separated\r\nfrom the coal as mining has progressed, and the roof is supported by an\r\nabundance of props, or “posts” as they are here called. In one room,\r\nwith an ordinary roof, about six hundred and fifteen posts would be\r\nnecessary. The pillars are long, the distances between break-throughs\r\naveraging thirty yards. This is known as the “double entry” system,\r\nto distinguish it from the single entry system which was formerly in\r\ngeneral use. The method by single entry consisted in driving the butt\r\nentries singly, about one hundred and sixty yards apart, and the face\r\nentries the same distance apart, at right angles to the butt entries,\r\nthus laying off the mine in large square blocks which were then mined\r\nout. The difficulty with this system was that from twenty-five to fifty\r\nper cent. of the pillars were necessarily lost, while by the double\r\nentry system, which now prevails, all or nearly all the pillars can be\r\ntaken out.\r\n\r\nOf course the features in the plan of each mine vary according to the\r\nspecial necessities of that mine, but in general they do not differ\r\ngreatly from those that have been described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF A BITUMINOUS COAL MINE.]\r\n\r\nThe method of cutting coal here is also peculiar to the soft coal\r\nmines. The miner has a pick with sharp, pointed ends, and with this\r\nhe cuts a horizontal groove or channel, from two and a half to three\r\nand a half feet deep across the entire width of the entry or room.\r\nThis groove is cut in that horizontal section of the face known as the\r\nbearing-in section. It may be in the bottom layer of coal, or it may\r\nbe one or two feet above the bottom. The process itself is known as\r\n“bearing in,” “under cutting,” “holing,” or “undermining.” While he\r\nis at this work the miner must lie on the floor of the room, partly\r\non his side, but with hands and arms free. When the horizontal groove\r\nhas been completed a vertical groove similar to it in size and shape\r\nis made at one side of the face. These channels are sometimes cut\r\nwith mining machines having compressed air for a motive power. This\r\nmachine is small but powerful. It is placed on a low inclined platform\r\nat the face of coal, and is operated by a man called a “runner.” The\r\ninclination of the platform causes the machine, which is on wheels, to\r\ngravitate constantly toward, and to press against, the face of coal.\r\nThe compressed air cylinder drives a piston-rod to which is attached\r\na steel bit two inches in diameter projecting from the front of the\r\nmachine. This bit strikes the coal with sharp, swift blows, chipping\r\nit out in small fragments, and eats its way rapidly into the seam.\r\nThe compressed air is carried to the machine in an iron pipe from the\r\ncompressing engine, which is located at the mouth of the mine. When\r\na machine is used, seven men usually work three rooms. Three of these\r\nmen are contractors or partners, three of them are laborers employed\r\nby the contractors, and one of them, called the “scraper,” is a\r\nlaborer employed by the coal company. When the channel has been cut a\r\nsufficient depth and distance the coal above it is brought down either\r\nby wedging or blasting. If blasting is to be resorted to it will be\r\nunnecessary to cut the vertical groove. If the bearing-in channel was\r\ncut above the floor, the bottom coal is then lifted by wedging, and\r\nbroken up. The miners do the cutting and blasting, the laborers break\r\nup the coal and load it into the mine wagons, and the scraper is kept\r\nbusy cleaning the cuttings away from the channels and attending to the\r\nlamps.\r\n\r\nThe mine car track that is extended up into the room is of wooden\r\nrails, and the empty wagon is pushed in to the face by the laborers,\r\nand loaded and run out by them to the entry. Each wagon will hold a\r\nlittle more than a ton, and a mule will draw four wagons to the mouth\r\nof the drift. The wheels of the mine car are set close to each other,\r\nnear the middle of the car, to facilitate its movement around sharp\r\ncurves; the doors at the ends of the car are swung from a bar hinge at\r\nthe top, and the cars are dumped in the same manner as those in the\r\nanthracite region. In some of the bituminous mines a small locomotive\r\nis used to draw the trains of mine wagons from the working parts of\r\nthe mine to the opening. It will draw from twelve to sixteen wagons\r\nat a time, and will do the work of twenty mules. There is usually a\r\nseparate split of the air current to supply the locomotive road in\r\norder to keep the smoke out of the working rooms.\r\n\r\nWhen a set of rooms has been driven to its limit the miners then\r\n“draw back the rib;” that is, take out the pillars between the rooms,\r\nbeginning at the face and working back. Posts must be used freely to\r\nsupport the roof while this work is in progress, about sixty or seventy\r\nbeing necessary in drawing a rib.\r\n\r\nVentilation here is obtained by both the fan and the furnace systems.\r\nIn mines that are worked below water level fire damp often accumulates,\r\nbut where the coal does not descend at any point below the water-level\r\nline, there is no probability that mine gases will be found.\r\n\r\nAs has already been said, the usual method of entry into the bituminous\r\nmines has been, and still is, by drift. But as the working faces of the\r\nmines recede farther and farther from the general lines of outcrop, it\r\noften becomes necessary to resort to the method of entry by shaft, and\r\nthis latter method will doubtless in time supersede the former almost\r\nentirely. The main shaft, as it is now constructed, is usually about\r\ntwenty feet long by nine feet wide, and has three compartments, two for\r\nhoisting and one for ventilation and pumping. It rarely exceeds two\r\nhundred feet in depth. The hoisting apparatus is much like that in use\r\nin the anthracite districts. Air shafts from fifty to one hundred feet\r\ndeep, sunk for purposes of ventilation and drainage, are frequent, and\r\nstair shafts in which are fixed ladders for the purpose of ascent and\r\ndescent, and which may be used as air shafts also, are not uncommon.\r\nSlopes, like those in the anthracite regions, are not usual here; the\r\ncoal seams do not dip sufficiently to make them practicable. Narrow\r\nrock slopes are sometimes driven diagonally through the strata, at an\r\ninclination of twenty degrees or less, to strike the coal bed, but they\r\nare used only as air ways, as traveling ways for men and mules, and to\r\nserve as the “second opening” required by the mine law.\r\n\r\nIn the bituminous regions coal breakers are unnecessary and are\r\nunknown. As the vertical planes of cleavage of the coal are at right\r\nangles to each other, and as the stratification is nearly horizontal,\r\nthe coal when broken takes a cubical form, large blocks of it being\r\nmade up of smaller cubes, and these of still smaller, to an almost\r\nmicroscopic limit. All slate is separated from the coal as it is mined,\r\nand the refuse is piled up in the room.\r\n\r\nThe mine wagon is loaded only with good coal, and is taken directly\r\nfrom the mine to a building which, with its appliances, is called a\r\n“tipple.” It is here dumped into a screen, it runs from the screen\r\ninto a car or boat, and is then ready to be hauled or floated to market.\r\n\r\nIf the opening of the mine is practically on the same level as the\r\ntipple the arrangements are very simple, as no extra motive power is\r\nrequired to get the cars to the dumping place. It is usual, however, to\r\nfind the opening at a higher point than the tipple, since the latter\r\nmust always be at the railroad track or on the bank of a river. It\r\nbecomes necessary, therefore, in this case, to raise and lower the cars\r\nbetween the opening of the mine and the tipple. This is usually done by\r\nthe inclined plane system, in which the loaded cars descending draw the\r\nlight ones up. The same system is much used in the anthracite mines,\r\nand has already been explained.\r\n\r\nThe railroad tipple consists simply of a frame building from forty to\r\nsixty feet long, fifteen feet high, and from eighteen to thirty feet\r\nwide. This structure is set upon four or five plain timber bents,\r\nand its floor is usually twenty-seven feet higher than the top of\r\nthe track rails which run beneath the outer end of it. A platform on\r\nthis floor is so adjusted by a single shaft that, when a loaded car\r\nis pushed on it, it tips forward to an angle of about thirty degrees.\r\nThe end gate of the wagon is then opened and the coal runs out on to\r\nthe screen. This screen is simply a set of longitudinal iron bars\r\ninclined outwardly at distances apart of one and one half inches. All\r\ncoal that passes over these bars is called “lump coal” and is run\r\ninto a sheet-iron pan suspended from the scales platform, where it is\r\nweighed, and it is then dropped directly into a car standing on the\r\ntrack below it. The coal which passed through the first set of bars\r\nhas, in the mean time, fallen on to a second screen with bars only\r\nthree quarters of an inch apart. The coal that passes over these bars\r\nis called nut coal, and is also weighed and dropped into the cars,\r\nwhile the coal that passes through the bars is called “slack.” This is\r\ndropped into a shute, is carried by it into a car on the slack track,\r\nand is run thence to the dumping ground. When all three kinds of coal\r\nare loaded together it is called “run of mine,” while lump and nut coal\r\ntogether make “three quarter coal.” These tipples may, of course, be\r\nbuilt with two sets of screens and platforms, and thus be made to do\r\ndouble work, and some of them are so built. Under the projecting end\r\nof the tipple there are usually four tracks; the first or outside one\r\nfor box-cars, the next for lump-coal cars, the next for nut-coal cars,\r\nand the last for cars for slack. Four men operate a single railroad\r\ntipple; two dump and weigh the coal above, while the others trim and\r\nmove the railroad cars on the track below. To this number a helper is\r\noften added, both above and below. Besides these men a boy is usually\r\nemployed to rake the nut coal from the lower screening bars where it\r\nsticks and prevents the slack from passing through. Sometimes it takes\r\ntwo boys to do this work properly. Boys are also employed to push the\r\nslack with a scraper down the shutes into the car on the slack track\r\nwhen the elevation of the tipple above the rails is not sufficient to\r\nafford the necessary grade. Bars are being largely superseded now by\r\nrevolving screens for separating slack from nut coal; they do the work\r\nfar better, and make the employment of a raking boy unnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe river tipple is operated in much the same way as the railroad\r\ntipple, except that its apparatus must be so arranged as to accommodate\r\nitself to high or low water. The floor of the river tipple is usually\r\nplaced from forty to fifty feet above low-water mark, and the weighing\r\npan is held in position by a counter-weight, which may be raised or\r\nlowered at pleasure. A small stationary engine, or a hand windlass,\r\ndraws the empty boat or barge into position under that end of the\r\ntipple which projects over the water. About twice as many men are\r\nrequired to operate a river tipple as are necessary to operate a\r\nrailroad tipple, and while the railroad tipple costs but from two\r\nthousand to four thousand dollars the river tipple is built at an\r\nexpense of from four thousand to ten thousand dollars. But even this\r\nlatter figure is small when compared with the cost of an anthracite\r\nbreaker, which may run anywhere from twenty thousand to one hundred\r\nthousand dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE BOY WORKERS AT THE MINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the coal mines of the United States boys are employed at two kinds\r\nof labor: to attend the doors on the traveling roads, and to drive the\r\nmules. This is known as inside work. Their outside work consists in\r\npicking slate at the breaker, and in driving the mules that draw mine\r\ncars on the surface. No one of these different kinds of employment is\r\nsuch as to overtax the physical strength of boys of a proper age, but\r\nthey are all confining, some are dangerous, and some are laborious. Yet\r\nthe system of child labor in the coal mines of America has never been\r\ncomparable to that which was formerly in vogue in Great Britain. The\r\nBritish “Coal Mines Regulation Act” of 1872 remedied the then existing\r\nevils to a considerable extent; but the hardships still to be endured\r\nby children in the British mines are greater than those which their\r\nAmerican brothers must suffer. The act of 1872, just referred to,\r\nprovides that boys under ten years of age shall not be employed under\r\nground, and that boys between ten and twelve years of age shall be\r\nallowed to work only in thin mines. It is the duty of these children\r\nto push the cars, or trams as they are called, from the working faces\r\nto the main road and back. Boys who are thus employed are called\r\n“hurriers” or “putters.” They are often obliged to crawl on their hands\r\nand knees, pushing the car ahead of them, because the roof of the\r\nexcavation is so low. That is why boys who are so young are allowed\r\nto work here; because, being small, they can the more readily crawl\r\nthrough the passages cut in these thin seams, which often do not have a\r\nvertical measurement of more than from twenty to twenty-eight inches.\r\nThe act of 1872 forbids the employment of females in the British mines;\r\nbut formerly not only boys but girls and women also worked underground.\r\nThere was then no restriction as to age, and girls were sent into the\r\nmines to labor at an earlier age than were boys, because they were\r\ncredited with being smarter and more obedient. It was common to find\r\nchildren of both sexes not more than six years old working underground;\r\nand girls of five years were employed at the same tasks as boys of six\r\nor eight. They took the coal from the working faces in the thin mines\r\nto the foot of the pit. Sometimes they carried it, sometimes they drew\r\nit in little carts. The older children and young women had a sort of\r\nsledge, called a “corve,” on which they dragged the coal, but sometimes\r\nthey preferred to carry it in baskets on their backs. They were called\r\n“pannier women.” The girls tucked their hair up under their caps,\r\ndressed like their brothers, and in the darkness of the mine could\r\nscarcely be distinguished from boys. And the girls and boys not only\r\ndressed alike, but worked alike, lived alike, and were treated alike at\r\ntheir tasks, and that treatment was rough and harsh at the very best.\r\nAs the girls grew they were given harder work to do. On one occasion\r\nMr. William Hunter, the mine foreman at Ormiston Colliery said that\r\nin the mines women always did the lifting or heavy part of the work,\r\nand that neither they nor the children were treated like human beings.\r\n“Females,” he said, “submit to work in places in which no man nor lad\r\ncould be got to labor. They work on bad roads, up to their knees in\r\nwater, and bent nearly double. The consequence of this is that they are\r\nattacked with disease, drag out a miserable existence, or are brought\r\nprematurely to the grave.” Says Robert Bold, the eminent miner: “In\r\nsurveying the workings of an extensive colliery underground a married\r\nwoman came forward, groaning under an excessive weight of coals,\r\ntrembling in every nerve, and almost unable to keep her knees from\r\nsinking under her. On coming up she said in a plaintive, melancholy\r\nvoice: ‘Oh, sir! this is sore, sore, sore work. I would to God that the\r\nfirst woman who tried to bear coals had broken her back and none ever\r\ntried it again.’”\r\n\r\nOne cannot read of such things as these, of a slavery that condemned\r\neven the babes to a life of wretched toil in the blackness of the\r\nmines, and then wonder that the great heart of Mrs. Browning should\r\nhave been wrenched by the contemplation of such sorrow until she gave\r\nvoice to her feeling in that most pathetic and wonderful of all her\r\npoems, “The Cry of the Children.”\r\n\r\n    “Do ye hear the children weeping, O my brothers!\r\n       Ere the sorrow comes with years?\r\n     They are leaning their young heads against their mothers,\r\n       And _that_ cannot stop their tears.\r\n     The young lambs are bleating in the meadows,\r\n       The young birds are chirping in their nest,\r\n     The young fawns are playing with the shadows,\r\n       The young flowers are blooming toward the west.\r\n     But the young, young children, O my brothers!\r\n       They are weeping bitterly;\r\n     They are weeping in the playtime of the others,\r\n       In the country of the free.\r\n\r\n    “‘For, oh!’ say the children, ‘we are weary,\r\n       And we cannot run or leap;\r\n     If we cared for any meadows, it were merely\r\n       To drop down in them and sleep.\r\n     Our knees tremble sorely in the stooping,\r\n       We fall upon our faces trying to go,\r\n     And, underneath our heavy eyelids drooping,\r\n       The reddest flower would look as pale as snow.\r\n     For all day we drag our burden tiring,\r\n       Through the coal dark underground,\r\n     Or all day we drive the wheels of iron\r\n       In the factories round and round.’\r\n\r\n    “‘How long,’ they say, ‘how long, O cruel nation!\r\n       Will you stand to move the world on a child’s heart,\r\n     Stifle down, with a mailed heel, its palpitation,\r\n       And tread onward to your throne amid the mart?\r\n     Our blood splashes upward, O gold heaper!\r\n       And your purple shows your path;\r\n     But the child’s sob in the silence curses deeper\r\n       Than the strong man in his wrath.’”\r\n\r\nIn the United States neither girls nor women have ever been employed\r\nin or about the mines. The legislative prohibition of such employment,\r\nenacted in Pennsylvania in 1885, was therefore unnecessary but not\r\ninappropriate.\r\n\r\nThe general mine law of Pennsylvania of 1870, which was the first to\r\nlimit the employment of boys in the mines according to their age, fixed\r\ntwelve years as the age under which a boy might not work underground;\r\nbut maintained silence as to the age at which he might work at a\r\ncolliery outside. This provision was amended and enlarged by the act of\r\n1885, which prohibited the employment of boys under fourteen years of\r\nage inside the mines, and of boys under twelve years of age in or about\r\nthe outside structures or workings of a colliery.\r\n\r\nThe duties of a driver boy are more laborious than those of a\r\ndoor-tender, but less monotonous and tiresome than those of a slate\r\npicker or breaker-boy. When the mules are kept in the mines night\r\nand day, as they frequently are in deep workings, the driver must\r\ngo down the shaft before seven o’clock, get his mule from the mine\r\nstable, bring him to the foot of the shaft, and hitch him to a trip\r\nof empty cars. He usually takes in to the working faces four empty\r\ncars and brings out four loaded ones. When he is ready to start in\r\nwith his trip, he climbs into the forward car, cracks his whip about\r\nthe beast’s head, and goes off shouting. His whip is a long, braided\r\nleather lash, attached to a short stout stick for a handle. He may\r\nhave a journey of a mile or more before reaching the foot of the\r\nfirst chamber he is to supply; but when he comes to it he unfastens\r\nthe first car from the others and drives the mule up the chamber with\r\nit, leaving it at a convenient distance from the face. He continues\r\nthis process at each of the chambers in succession, until his supply\r\nof empty cars is exhausted. At the foot of the last chamber which\r\nhe visits he finds a loaded car to which he attaches his mule, and\r\npicking up other loaded cars on his way back, he makes up his return\r\ntrip, and is soon on the long, unbroken journey to the shaft. There\r\nare sidings at intervals along the heading, where trips going in the\r\nopposite direction are met and passed, and where there is opportunity\r\nto stop for a moment and talk with or chaff some other driver boy.\r\nIf there be a plane on the main road, either ascending or descending\r\nfrom the first level, two sets of driver boys and mules are necessary,\r\none set to draw cars between the breasts and the plane, and the other\r\nset to draw them between the plane and the shaft. Of course, in steep\r\npitching seams, all cars are left at the foot of the chamber and are\r\nloaded there. There are two dangers to which driver boys are chiefly\r\nsubjected; one is that of being crushed between cars, or between cars\r\nand pillars or props, and the other is that of being kicked or bitten\r\nby vicious mules. The boy must not only learn to drive, but he must\r\nlearn to govern his beast and keep out of harm’s way. He is generally\r\nsufficiently skillful and agile to do this, but it is not unusual to\r\nread of severe injuries to boys, given by kicking, bucking, or biting\r\nmules.\r\n\r\nIf the mine in which the boy works is entered by drift or tunnel,\r\nhis duties lie partly outside of it, since he must bring every trip\r\nof cars not only to the mouth of the opening but to the breaker or\r\nother dumping place, which may be located at a considerable distance\r\nfrom the entrance to the mine. So that for a greater or less number\r\nof times each day he has from ten minutes to half an hour in the open\r\nair. In the summer time, when the weather is pleasant, this occasional\r\nglimpse of out-of-doors is very gratifying to him. He likes to be in\r\nthe sunlight, to look out over the woods and fields, to feel the fresh\r\nwind blowing in his face, and to breathe an unpolluted atmosphere. But\r\nin the winter time, when it is cold, when the storms are raging, when\r\nthe snow and sleet are whirled savagely into his face, then the outside\r\nportion of his trip is not pleasant. In the mine he finds a uniform\r\ntemperature of about sixty degrees Fahrenheit. To go from this, within\r\nten minutes, without additional clothing, into an atmosphere in which\r\nthe mercury stands at zero, and where the wind is blowing a hurricane,\r\nis necessarily to suffer. It cannot be otherwise. So there is no\r\nlagging outside on winter days; the driver boy delivers his loads, gets\r\nhis empty cars, and hastens back to the friendly shelter of the mine.\r\nAt such openings as these the mine stable is outside, and the boy must\r\ngo there in the morning to get his mule, and must leave him there when\r\nhe quits work at night. Sometimes, when the mining is done by shaft\r\nor slope, there is a separate entrance for men and mules, a narrow\r\ntunnel or slope, not too steep, and in this case, though his duties lie\r\nentirely in the mine, the driver boy must take the mule in from the\r\noutside stable in the morning and bring him back at night.\r\n\r\nOne afternoon I chanced to be in a certain mine in the Wyoming\r\ndistrict, in company with the fire boss. We were standing in a\r\npassage that led to one of these mule ways. In the distance we heard\r\na clattering of hoofs, growing louder as it came nearer, and, as we\r\nstepped aside, a mule went dashing by with a boy lying close on his\r\nback, the flame from the little lamp in the boy’s cap just a tiny\r\nbackward streak of blue that gave no light. They had appeared from the\r\nintense darkness and had disappeared into it again almost while one\r\ncould draw a breath. I looked at the fire boss inquiringly.\r\n\r\n“Oh! that’s all right,” he said, “they’ve got through work and they’re\r\ngoing out, and the mule is in just as much of a hurry as the boy is.”\r\n\r\n“But the danger,” I suggested, “of racing at such speed through narrow,\r\nwinding passages, in almost total darkness!”\r\n\r\n“Oh!” he replied, “that beast knows the way out just as well as I do,\r\nand he can find it as easy as if he could see every inch of it, and I\r\ndon’t know but what he can. Anyway the boy ain’t afraid if the mule\r\nain’t.”\r\n\r\nIn deep mines, as has already been said, it is customary to build\r\nstables not far from the foot of the shaft, and to keep the mules there\r\nexcept when for any reason there is a long suspension of work. At many\r\nmines, however, the greater convenience of having the stables on the\r\nsurface induces the operators to have the mules hoisted from the shaft\r\nevery night and taken down every morning. They step on the carriage\r\nvery demurely, and ascend or descend without making trouble. They are\r\nespecially glad to go up to their stables at night. Where mules are\r\nfed in the mine, and especially in those mines that have stables in\r\nthem, rats are usually found. How they get down a shaft is a mystery.\r\nThe common explanation is that they go with the hay. But they take up\r\ntheir quarters in the mine, live, thrive, increase rapidly, and grow\r\nto an enormous size. They are much like the wharf rats that infest the\r\nwharves of great cities, both in size and ugliness. They are very bold\r\nand aggressive, and when attacked will turn on their enemy, whether man\r\nor beast, and fight to the death. There is a superstition among miners\r\nto the effect that when the rats leave a mine some great disaster is\r\nabout to take place in it; probably an extensive fall. Rats are hardly\r\nto be credited, however, with an instinct that would lead them to\r\nforecast such an event with more certainty than human experience and\r\nskill can do.\r\n\r\nBut it is not improbable that the driver boy and his mule will be\r\nsuperseded, at no distant day, by electricity. In one instance at least\r\nthis new motive power has already been put into use. This is at the\r\nLykens Valley Colliery of the Lykens Valley Coal Company, in Dauphin\r\nCounty, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe duty of an outside driver boy is to take the loaded cars from the\r\nhead of the shaft or slope to the breaker, and to bring the empty ones\r\nback; his work being all done in the open air. Of late this service,\r\nespecially where the distance is considerable, is performed by a small\r\nlocomotive, which draws trains of as many cars as can well be held\r\ntogether. The wages paid to inside driver boys by the Pennsylvania Coal\r\nCompany in 1888 were from one dollar to one dollar and ten cents a day,\r\nand to outside driver boys eighty-eight cents a day.\r\n\r\nThe door boys are usually younger and smaller than the driver boys,\r\nand though their duty is not so laborious as that of the latter class,\r\nit is far more monotonous and tiresome. The door boy must be at his\r\npost when the first trip goes in in the morning, and must remain there\r\ntill the last one comes out at night. He is alone all day, save when\r\nother boys and men pass back and forth through his door, and he has but\r\nlittle opportunity for companionship. He fashions for himself a rude\r\nbench to sit on; sometimes he has a rope or other contrivance attached\r\nto his door by which he can open it without rising; but usually he is\r\nglad to move about a little to break the monotony of his task. There is\r\nlittle he can do to entertain himself, except perhaps to whittle. He\r\nseldom tries to read; indeed, the light given forth by a miner’s lamp\r\nis too feeble to read by. In rare cases the door boy extinguishes his\r\nlight, on the score of economy, and sits in darkness, performing his\r\nduties by the light of the lamps of those who pass. But there are few\r\nwho can endure this. It is hard enough to bear the oppressive silence\r\nthat settles down on the neighborhood when no cars are passing; if\r\ndarkness be added to this the strain becomes too great, the effect too\r\ndepressing, a child cannot bear it. The wages of the door boy are about\r\nsixty-five cents per day.\r\n\r\nAlthough the duties of the breaker boy or slate picker are more\r\nlaborious and more monotonous than those of either driver boy or door\r\ntender, he does not receive so high a rate of wages as either of them.\r\nHis daily compensation is only from fifty to sixty-five cents, and he\r\nworks ten hours a day. At seven o’clock in the morning he must have\r\nclimbed the dark and dusty stairway to the screen room, and taken his\r\nplace on the little bench across the long shute. The whistle screams,\r\nthe ponderous machinery is set in motion, the iron-teethed rollers\r\nbegin to revolve heavily, crunching the big lumps of coal as they turn,\r\nthe deafening noise breaks forth, and then the black, shallow streams\r\nof broken coal start on their journey down the iron-sheathed shutes, to\r\nbe screened and cleaned, and picked and loaded.\r\n\r\nAt first glance it would not seem to be a difficult task to pick\r\nslate, but there are several things to be taken into consideration\r\nbefore a judgment can properly be made up in the matter. To begin\r\nwith, the work is confining and monotonous. The boy must sit on his\r\nbench all day, bending over constantly to look down at the coal that\r\nis passing beneath him. His tender hands must become toughened by long\r\nand harsh contact with sharp pieces of slate and coal, and after many\r\ncuts and bruises have left marks and scars on them for a lifetime.\r\nHe must breathe an atmosphere thick with the dust of coal, so thick\r\nthat one can barely see across the screen room when the boys are\r\nsitting at their tasks. It is no wonder that a person long subjected\r\nto the irritating presence of this dust in his bronchial tubes and\r\non his lungs is liable to suffer from the disease known as “miner’s\r\nconsumption.” In the hot days of summer the screen-room is a stifling\r\nplace. The sun pours its rays upon the broad, sloping roof of the\r\nbreaker, just overhead; the dust-laden atmosphere is never cleared\r\nor freshened by so much as a breath of pure sweet air, and the very\r\nthought of green fields and blossoming flowers and the swaying branches\r\nof trees renders the task here to be performed more burdensome. Yet\r\neven this is not so bad as it is to work here in the cold days of\r\nwinter. It is almost impossible to heat satisfactorily by any ordinary\r\nmethod so rambling a structure as a breaker necessarily is, and it is\r\nquite impossible to divide the portion devoted to screening and picking\r\ninto closed rooms. The screen-rooms are, therefore, always cold. Stoves\r\nare often set up in them, but they radiate heat through only a limited\r\nspace, and cannot be said to make the room warm. Notwithstanding the\r\npresence of stoves, the boys on the benches shiver at their tasks, and\r\npick slate with numb fingers, and suffer from the extreme cold through\r\nmany a winter day. But science and the progress of ideas are coming to\r\ntheir aid. In some breakers, recently erected, steam-heating pipes have\r\nbeen introduced into the screen-rooms with great success; the warmth\r\nand comfort given by them to the little workers is beyond measurement.\r\nFans have been put into the breakers, also, to collect and carry\r\naway the dust and keep the air of the picking-room clean and fresh,\r\nand electric lamps have been swung from the beams to be lighted in the\r\nearly mornings and late afternoons, that the young toilers may see\r\nto do their work. Indeed, such improvements as these pass beyond the\r\ndomain of science and progress into that of humanitarianism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SLATE PICKERS AT WORK.]\r\n\r\nWhen night comes no laborer is more rejoiced at leaving his task than\r\nis the breaker boy. One can see his eyes shine and his white teeth\r\ngleam as he starts out into the open air, while all else, hands,\r\nface, clothing, are thickly covered with coal dust, are black and\r\nunrecognizable. But he is happy because his day’s work is done and he\r\nis free, for a few hours at least, from the tyranny of the “cracker\r\nboss.” For, in the estimation of the picker boys, the cracker boss is\r\nindeed the most tyrannical of masters. How else could they regard a man\r\nwhose sole duty it is to be constantly in their midst, to keep them\r\nat their tasks, to urge them to greater zeal and care, to repress all\r\nboyish freaks, to rule over them almost literally with a rod of iron?\r\nBut, alas! the best commentary on the severity of his government is\r\nthat it is necessary.\r\n\r\nAs has already been said, the day is evidently not far distant when the\r\nwork which the breaker boy now does will be performed almost wholly by\r\nmachinery. And this will be not alone because the machine does its\r\nwork better, more surely, more economically, than the breaker boy has\r\ndone his, but it will be also because the requisite number of boys for\r\nbreaker work will not be obtainable. Even now it is more than difficult\r\nto keep the ranks of the slate pickers full. Parents in the coal\r\nregions of to-day have too much regard for the health, the comfort,\r\nthe future welfare of their children, to send them generally to such\r\ngrinding tasks as these. This is one of the signs of that advancing\r\ncivilization which has already lifted girls and women from this, for\r\nthem, exhausting and degrading labor at the collieries; which is\r\nlessening, one by one, the hardships of the boys who still toil there;\r\nwhich, it is fondly hoped, will in the course of time give to all\r\nchildren the quiet of the school-room, the freedom of the play-ground,\r\nand the task that love sets, in place of that irksome toil that stunts\r\nthe body and dwarfs the soul. It is now mainly from the homes of the\r\nvery poor that the child-workers at the collieries are recruited, and\r\nthe scant wages that they earn may serve to keep bread in the mouths\r\nof the younger children of their households and clothing on their own\r\nbacks.\r\n\r\nAccidents to boys employed at the mines are of frequent occurrence.\r\nScarcely a day passes but the tender flesh of some poor little fellow\r\nis cut or bruised, or his bones, twisted and broken. It is only\r\nthe more serious of these accidents that reach the notice of the\r\nmine inspector and are returned in his annual report. Yet, to the\r\nhumanitarian and the lover of children, these annual returns tell a\r\nsad story. The mine inspector’s reports for 1887 show that in the\r\nanthracite region alone during that year eighteen boys fifteen years\r\nof age and under were killed while fulfilling the duties of their\r\nemployment in and about the coal mines, and that seventy-three others\r\nwere seriously injured, many of them doubtless maimed for life. These\r\nfigures tell their own story of sorrow and of suffering.\r\n\r\nYet with all their hardships it cannot be said that the boys who work\r\nin the collieries are wholly unhappy. It is difficult, indeed, to\r\nso limit, confine, and gird down a boy that he will not snatch some\r\nenjoyment from his life; and these boys seek to get much.\r\n\r\nOne who has been long accustomed to them can generally tell the nature\r\nof their several occupations by the way in which they try to amuse\r\nthemselves. The driver boys are inclined to be rude and boisterous in\r\ntheir fun, free and impertinent in their manner, and chafe greatly\r\nunder restraint. The slate pickers, confined all day at their tasks,\r\nwith no opportunity for sport of any kind, are inclined to bubble over\r\nwhen night and freedom come, but, as a rule, they are too tired to\r\ndisplay more than a passing effort at jocularity. Door boys are quiet\r\nand contemplative. Sitting so long alone in the darkness they become\r\nthoughtful, sober, sometimes melancholy. They go silently to their\r\nhomes when they leave the mine; they do not stop to play tricks or\r\nto joke with their fellows; they do not run, nor sing, nor whistle.\r\nDarkness and silence are always depressing, and so much of it in\r\nthese young lives cannot help but sadden without sweetening them. We\r\nshall never see, in America, those horrors of child slavery that drew\r\nso passionate a protest from the great-hearted Mrs. Browning, but\r\ncertainly, looking at the progress already made, it is not too much to\r\nhope for that the day will come when no child’s hand shall ever again\r\nbe soiled by the labor of the mine.\r\n\r\nIt will be a fitting close to this chapter, and will be an act of\r\njustice to the memory of a brave and heroic boy, to relate the story\r\nof Martin Crahan’s sacrifice at the time of the disaster at the West\r\nPittston shaft. Martin was a driver boy, of humble parentage, poor and\r\nunlearned. He was in the mine when the fire in the breaker broke out,\r\nand he ran, with others, to the foot of the shaft. But just as he was\r\nabout to step on the carriage that would have taken him in safety to\r\nthe surface he bethought him of the men on the other side of the shaft,\r\nwho might not have heard of the fire, and his brave heart prompted him\r\nto go to them with the alarm. He asked another boy to go with him, but\r\nthat boy refused. He did not stop to parley; he started at once alone.\r\nBut while he ran through the dark passage on his errand of mercy, the\r\ncarriage went speeding, for the last time, up the burning shaft. He\r\ngave the alarm and returned, in breathless haste, with those whom he\r\nhad sought; but it was too late, the cage had already fallen. When the\r\nparty was driven away from the foot of the shaft by the smoke and the\r\ngas, he, in some unexplained way, became separated from the rest, and\r\nwandered off alone. The next day a rescuing party found him in the\r\nmine-stable, dead. He lay there beside the body of his mule. Deprived\r\nof the presence of human beings in the hours of that dreadful night, he\r\nhad sought the company of the beast that had long been his companion in\r\ndaily labor――and they died together.\r\n\r\nBut he had thought of those who were dear to him, for on a rough board\r\nnear by he had written with chalk the name of his father and of his\r\nmother, and of a little cousin who had been named for him. He was only\r\ntwelve years old when he died, but the title of hero was never more\r\nfairly earned than it was by him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nMINERS AND THEIR WAGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA good miner may be called a “skilled workman,” and, as such, he\r\nis entitled to greater compensation for his labor than an ordinary\r\nworkman. He expects it and gets it. There are two principal systems by\r\nwhich payments are made to miners. The first is according to the number\r\nof cubic yards of coal cut, and the second is according to the number\r\nof tons of coal mined and sent out. The first, which is prevalent in\r\nthe regions of steep-pitching seams, is followed because the coal may\r\nremain in the chamber for an indefinite time after being cut. The\r\nsecond, which in the Wyoming region is almost universal, is somewhat\r\nmore complicated. A chamber is taken by two miners, but the account\r\non the books of the coal company is usually kept in the name of only\r\none of them, who is held to be the responsible member of the firm. For\r\ninstance, “Patrick Collins & Co.” work a chamber in Law Shaft, and\r\nthe firm is so designated. The first thing they do is to adopt some\r\ndistinctive mark which may be chalked on the sides of their loaded cars\r\nto distinguish them from the loaded cars from other chambers. The\r\nletters of the alphabet are frequently used by miners, but, in default\r\nof these, some simple design that cannot readily be mistaken for any\r\nother is put into service. The triangle ∆ is a very common symbol with\r\nthem, so is the long, horizontal line, crossed by short vertical ones,\r\nthus: ――|――|――――|――. The miners call this a candle. When a car has\r\nbeen loaded the symbol is chalked on the side of it, together with a\r\nnumber which tells how many cars have been sent from the chamber during\r\nthe day. For instance, when a mine car appears at the surface marked\r\n“∆ 5” it means that the car is from a certain chamber designated by\r\nthat symbol, and that this is the fifth car which has been sent from\r\nthat chamber during the day. On its way from the head of the breaker\r\nto the dumping cradle, the loaded car passes over the platform of the\r\nweighing scales and registers its weight on the scale beam. This weight\r\nis quickly read by the weigh-master, is transferred to his book, and\r\ngoes to make up the daily report. In some districts a system in which\r\ntickets are used instead of chalk marks is in vogue, and in other\r\ndistricts duplicate checks are employed, but everywhere the general\r\nfeatures remain the same.\r\n\r\nIn order to get a chamber from any of the large mining corporations, a\r\nminer must apply in person to the mining superintendent. He must come\r\nwell recommended, or he must be known as a skillful, industrious, and\r\ntemperate workman. The responsibility of driving a chamber properly is\r\nnot a small one, and mining companies choose to take as little risk as\r\npossible in the selection of their men. Having accepted an applicant\r\nfor a chamber, the company makes a contract with him, usually a verbal\r\none, to pay him at a certain rate per ton or yard for the coal mined\r\nby him. The rate, though not wholly uniform, on account of the greater\r\nor less difficulty of cutting coal at the different collieries, is\r\npractically the same throughout an entire district.\r\n\r\nA miner working at full time and in a good seam will send out enough\r\ncoal each month to amount, at the contract price, to $150. But his\r\nexpenses for laborers’ wages, powder, oil, fuse, etc., will amount to\r\n$75 per month, leaving him a net income of $75 per month. The laborer\r\nis also paid according to the number of tons of coal sent out, and his\r\nwages will probably average $2 per day. It is not often in these days\r\nof thin seams that these rates of income are exceeded. And when the\r\nmines are in operation only a portion of the time, as is now often the\r\ncase, these figures are seriously reduced.\r\n\r\nThe subject of wages frequently has been under discussion between\r\nminers and operators, and the differences of opinion on it have been\r\nprolific of many strikes. By some corporations and at some collieries\r\na sliding scale has been adopted. That is, the miner has been paid,\r\nnot at a fixed rate, but at a rate which constantly adjusts itself to\r\nthe market price of coal. The objection to this method is said to be\r\nthat the great companies who practically control the anthracite coal\r\nbusiness form syndicates, fix the market price of their coal for a\r\ncertain period of time, and then limit the output of each member of the\r\nsyndicate to a certain number of tons during that period.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that no scheme of payment has yet been devised which is\r\nperfectly satisfactory to the great body of workers in the mines. But\r\nit is true also that employer and employee are working together more\r\nharmoniously now than they have worked at any time in the past, and\r\nthat long and stubborn strikes of miners are growing, year by year,\r\nless frequent. It is to be hoped that the time will come when even the\r\nstrike will not be considered necessary as a weapon of defense for the\r\nworkman. As a rule strikes result in loss, and in loss only, to both\r\ncapital and labor; and, as a rule also, labor suffers from them more\r\nthan does capital, and this is the saddest feature of the case. Hon.\r\nCarroll D. Wright, the National Commissioner of Labor, has compiled the\r\nstatistics of miners’ strikes in Pennsylvania for the years 1881 to\r\n1886 inclusive. His tables show that of 880 such strikes, which was the\r\ntotal number that occurred during the period named, 186 succeeded, 52\r\npartly succeeded, and 642 failed. The loss to employers resulting from\r\nthese strikes was $1,549,219; the loss to employees was $5,850,382; and\r\nthe assistance given to the strikers during the periods of suspension\r\namounted to $101,053. These figures form the best commentary to be had\r\non the subject of strikes; they are eloquent with tales of hardship, of\r\nsuffering, and of despair.\r\n\r\nIn those regions which have had long immunity from strikes, and in\r\nwhich work at full time has been the rule, the mine-workers are not\r\nonly comfortable, but frequently are prosperous. They rarely occupy\r\nrooms in the cheap tenement houses of the towns, even if such occupancy\r\nwould be to their convenience. They prefer to live in the outlying\r\ndistricts, where they can have homes of their own and gardens that\r\nthey may cultivate. In the colliery villages the lots are usually laid\r\nout and sold or rented by the mining company to its workmen. Rent is\r\nnot high, and, in case of sale, a long term contract is given, so that\r\npayments are in easy installments. The miner prefers to own his house\r\nand lot. Such ownership has a tendency to impress any man with the\r\nimportance and responsibility of his duty as a citizen, and the miner\r\nis no exception to the rule. He is apt to waste neither his time nor\r\nhis money when he has property and a family to care for. He tries, too,\r\nto lay by something for a rainy day; he knows that the probabilities\r\nare that either he or his family will eventually need it. As his hours\r\nof labor are comparatively short he has considerable leisure which he\r\nmay spend profitably or foolishly as he will. Many of the men spend\r\nthis leisure working in their gardens or about their premises. It is\r\nseldom that any of them go so far as to have regular extra employment\r\nto occupy their time while out of the mines. Indeed the prevailing\r\ntendency among miners is to do as little work as possible outside of\r\nthe mines. The opinion seems to be prevalent among them that when a\r\nminer has cut his coal he has done his full duty for the day, and is\r\nentitled then to rest and recreation. He does not take kindly to other\r\nkinds of work. He rarely deserts his occupation of mining to take up\r\nany other calling, and it may be said that after he has passed middle\r\nage he never does. There is a fascination to the old miner about the\r\ndark chambers, the black walls, the tap of the drill, the crash of\r\nfalling coal, the smell of powder smoke in the air, a fascination that\r\nis irresistible. He would almost rather die in the familiar gloom of\r\nthe mine than live and toil in the sunlight on the surface. Years of\r\nwalking under the low mine roofs have bent his back, have thrown his\r\nhead and shoulders forward, have given him that long swinging stride\r\ncharacteristic of old miners. His face is always pale; this is due, no\r\ndoubt, to the absence of sunlight in his working place; but, as a rule,\r\nhis general health is good; except when he has worked for a long time\r\nin dry and dusty mines. In that case he is apt to find himself, sooner\r\nor later, a victim to the disease known as “miner’s consumption.” The\r\nminer’s appearance, as he passes along the street or road on his way\r\nhome from his work, is, to eyes unaccustomed to the sight, anything but\r\nfavorable. He wears heavy, hobnailed shoes or boots, flannel shirt,\r\ncoarse jacket and pantaloons, all of them black with coal dirt and\r\nsaturated with oil. He has a habit, when he comes from his work, of\r\nthrowing his coat loosely about his shoulders, and wearing it so as\r\nhe goes to his home. He usually wears a cap on his head, sometimes a\r\nslouch hat, rarely the helmet or fireman’s hat with which artists are\r\naccustomed to picture him. This latter is too heavy and clumsy for\r\ncommon use; he only puts it on when working in places where water comes\r\ndown freely on his head. Hooked to the front of his cap is the little\r\ntin lamp already described. When he goes to or comes from his work in\r\nthe dark he allows it to burn and light him on his way. His face and\r\nhands are also black with coal dirt and powder smoke, and his features\r\nare hardly recognizable. The predominating race among the mine workers\r\nis the Irish, next in point of numbers comes the Welsh, then follow the\r\nScotch and English, and, finally, the German. Of late years, however,\r\nHungarian, Italian, and Russian laborers have come to the mines in\r\nlarge numbers, especially in the southern districts. These people can\r\nhardly be compared with the English or German speaking races; they\r\ndo not become citizens of the country, have in the main no family\r\nlife, and are, in a certain sense, slaves whose masters are their own\r\ncountrymen.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of the characteristics of the mine workers as a class, it\r\nmay be well, and it certainly is just, to correct a misapprehension\r\nconcerning them which has become prevalent. From reading the\r\ndescriptions given by newspaper correspondents and by certain writers\r\nof fiction, many people have come to think that all miners are little\r\nless than outlaws, that they are rude, ignorant, brutal in their\r\ninstincts, and blind in their passions and animosities. This is very\r\nfar indeed from the truth. Mine workers, as a class, are peaceful,\r\nlaw-abiding, intelligent citizens. That they are economical and\r\nindustrious is well attested by the comfortable appearance of their\r\nhomes, and the modest deposits that are made, in large numbers, in\r\nthe numerous miner’s savings banks of the different districts. There\r\nare, indeed, among them those who are intemperate, those who are\r\ncoarse and violent, a disgrace to themselves and a menace to society.\r\nThese are always the ones who come to the surface at a time when\r\nstrained relations exist between employers and employees, and by their\r\nharsh language and unlawful conduct in the name of oppressed labor\r\ncall down just retribution on themselves, but unjust condemnation\r\non the true mine workers, who compose ninety-nine one hundredths of\r\nthe class, but who do not go about drinking, ranting, destroying\r\nproperty, and inciting to crime. The proportion of “good-for-naughts”\r\namong the miners, however, is no greater than it is among any other\r\nclass of workmen having the same numbers, and the same advantages\r\nand disadvantages. With the exception of the Hungarians, Russians,\r\nItalians, and Poles, of whom mention has already been made, the miners\r\nand their families compare favorably with any class of workers in\r\nthe same grade of labor in America. Many of them indeed attain to\r\nprominent and responsible positions in business and society. Not a\r\nfew of the clerks, merchants, contractors, mining engineers, bankers,\r\nlawyers, preachers, of the coal regions of to-day have stepped into\r\nthose positions from the chambers of the mines, and have filled them\r\nadmirably. The miner is fond of his family; his children are dear\r\nto him, and, whenever the grim necessities of life permit, he sends\r\nthem to the schools instead of to the mines or breakers. He wishes\r\nto prepare them for a larger enjoyment of life than he himself has\r\nhad, even though that life should be spent in the occupation which he\r\nhimself has followed. And, indeed, there are few other occupations in\r\nwhich the possibilities of advancement are so great and so favorable.\r\nThere must be mine bosses, mine inspectors, mine superintendents, and\r\nmany of them, and they are, as a rule, promoted from the ranks. Young\r\nmen of character, skill, and judgment are almost sure to step into the\r\nhigher places.\r\n\r\nIf it were not for two evils that constantly menace and hamper him, the\r\ncoal miner of to-day would be the most favored of workmen. These twin\r\nevils are strikes and lockouts. Abolish them and there would be no more\r\ncomfortable, happy, and generally prosperous class of people in America\r\nthan the workers in the coal mines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY OF MINING TERMS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_After damp._ The mixture of gases resulting from the burning of fire\r\ndamp.\r\n\r\n_Air shaft._ A vertical opening into a mine for the passage of air.\r\n\r\n_Airway._ Any passage in the mine along which an air current passes;\r\nbut the term is commonly applied to that passage which is driven, for\r\nventilating purposes, parallel to and simultaneously with the gangway.\r\n\r\n_Anticlinal._ A fold of strata in which the inclination of the sides of\r\nthe fold is from the axis downward.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Barrier pillars._ Large pillars of coal left at a boundary line, or on\r\nthe outskirts of a squeeze.\r\n\r\n_Basin._ The hollow formed by a fold of the seam; any large area of\r\nincluded coal.\r\n\r\n_Battery_.
