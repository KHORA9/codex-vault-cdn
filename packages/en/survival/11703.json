The gradual progress of the family from utter destitution\r\nand misery, to happiness and abundance, arising from their own labour,\r\nperseverance, and obedience, together with the effect produced on the\r\ndifferent characters of the sons by the stirring adventures they met\r\nwith, created a deep and absorbing interest. Every young reader\r\npatronized either the noble Fritz, the studious Ernest, or the generous\r\nJack, and regarded him as a familiar personal acquaintance. The book had\r\nbut one defect—the death of the talented author left it unfinished, and\r\nevery reader regretted its abrupt termination.\r\n\r\nThis conclusion was happily supplied by one of the most accomplished and\r\nelegant writers of her day, the Baroness de Montolieu; and, sanctioned\r\nand approved by the son of the lamented author, the entire work was\r\npublished in France, and has for many years held a distinguished rank in\r\nthe juvenile libraries there. For the gratification of a little family\r\ncircle, this now appears in English; and as, on examining the first part\r\nin the original, it was found, that “some new discoveries might be\r\nmade,” it was thought best to re-translate it, subduing the tone of the\r\nwhole to English taste. The unanimous voices of the beloved circle, for\r\nwhom the pleasant task was undertaken, have pronounced the result to be\r\neminently successful, and they generously wish, that the whole of the\r\njuvenile public of England should share in their satisfaction, and\r\npossess _a complete Swiss Robinson_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very well known that, some years ago, Counsellor Horner, a Swiss,\r\nmade a voyage round the world in the Russian vessel _Le Podesda_,\r\ncommanded by Capt. Krusenstern. They discovered many islands, and,\r\namongst others, one very large and fertile, till then unknown to\r\nnavigators, to the S.W. of Java, near the coast of New Guinea. They\r\nlanded here, and to the great surprise of Mr. Horner, he was received by\r\na family who spoke to him in German. They were a father and mother, and\r\nfour robust and hardy sons.\r\n\r\nTheir history was very interesting. The father was a Swiss clergyman,\r\nwho, in the Revolution of 1798, had lost all his fortune, and had\r\ndetermined to emigrate, in order to seek elsewhere the means of\r\nsupporting his family. He went first to England, with his wife and\r\nchildren, consisting of four sons, between the ages of twelve and five.\r\nHe there undertook the office of missionary to Otaheite; not that he\r\nintended to remain on that uncivilized island, but he wished to proceed\r\nfrom thence to Port Jackson as a free colonist. He invested his little\r\ncapital in seeds of every description, and some cattle, to take out with\r\nhim. They had a prosperous voyage till they were near the coast of New\r\nGuinea, when they were overtaken by a frightful storm. At this period he\r\ncommenced his journal, which he afterwards committed to the care of Mr.\r\nHorner, to be forwarded to his friends in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nSome time before, a boat from an English vessel, the _Adventurer_, had\r\nvisited them, and the father had sent the first part of his journal by\r\nLieut. Bell to the captain, who remained in the vessel. A violent\r\ntempest arose, which continued some days, and drove the _Adventurer_\r\nfrom the coast. The family concluded the ship was lost; but this was not\r\nthe case, as will be seen in the conclusion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tempest had raged for six days, and on the seventh seemed to\r\nincrease. The ship had been so far driven from its course, that no one\r\non board knew where we were. Every one was exhausted with fatigue and\r\nwatching. The shattered vessel began to leak in many places, the oaths\r\nof the sailors were changed to prayers, and each thought only how to\r\nsave his own life. “Children,” said I, to my terrified boys, who were\r\nclinging round me, “God can save us if he will. To him nothing is\r\nimpossible; but if he thinks it good to call us to him, let us not\r\nmurmur; we shall not be separated.” My excellent wife dried her tears,\r\nand from that moment became more tranquil. We knelt down to pray for the\r\nhelp of our Heavenly Father; and the fervour and emotion of my innocent\r\nboys proved to me that even children can pray, and find in prayer\r\nconsolation and peace.\r\n\r\nWe rose from our knees strengthened to bear the afflictions that hung\r\nover us. Suddenly we heard amid the roaring of the waves the cry of\r\n“Land! land!” At that moment the ship struck on a rock; the concussion\r\nthrew us down. We heard a loud cracking, as if the vessel was parting\r\nasunder; we felt that we were aground, and heard the captain cry, in a\r\ntone of despair, “We are lost! Launch the boats!” These words were a\r\ndagger to my heart, and the lamentations of my children were louder than\r\never. I then recollected myself, and said, “Courage, my darlings, we are\r\nstill, above water, and the land is near. God helps those who trust in\r\nhim. Remain here, and I will endeavour to save us.”\r\n\r\nI went on deck, and was instantly thrown down, and wet through by a huge\r\nsea; a second followed. I struggled boldly with the waves, and succeeded\r\nin keeping myself up, when I saw, with terror, the extent of our\r\nwretchedness. The shattered vessel was almost in two; the crew had\r\ncrowded into the boats, and the last sailor was cutting the rope. I\r\ncried out, and prayed them to take us with them; but my voice was\r\ndrowned in the roar of the tempest, nor could they have returned for us\r\nthrough waves that ran mountains high. All hope from their assistance\r\nwas lost; but I was consoled by observing that the water did not enter\r\nthe ship above a certain height. The stern, under which lay the cabin\r\nwhich contained all that was dear to me on earth, was immovably fixed\r\nbetween two rocks. At the same time I observed, towards the south,\r\ntraces of land, which, though wild and barren, was now the haven of my\r\nalmost expiring hopes; no longer being able to depend on any human aid.\r\nI returned to my family, and endeavoured to appear calm. “Take courage,”\r\ncried I, “there is yet hope for us; the vessel, in striking between the\r\nrocks, is fixed in a position which protects our cabin above the water,\r\nand if the wind should settle to-morrow, we may possibly reach\r\nthe land.”\r\n\r\nThis assurance calmed my children, and as usual, they depended on all I\r\ntold them; they rejoiced that the heaving of the vessel had ceased, as,\r\nwhile it lasted, they were continually thrown against each other. My\r\nwife, more accustomed to read my countenance, discovered my uneasiness;\r\nand by a sign, I explained to her that I had lost all hope. I felt great\r\nconsolation in seeing that she supported our misfortune with truly\r\nChristian resignation.\r\n\r\n“Let us take some food,” said she; “with the body, the mind is\r\nstrengthened; this must be a night of trial.”\r\n\r\nNight came, and the tempest continued its fury; tearing away the planks\r\nfrom the devoted vessel with a fearful crashing. It appeared absolutely\r\nimpossible that the boats could have out-lived the storm.\r\n\r\nMy wife had prepared some refreshment, of which the children partook\r\nwith an appetite that we could not feel. The three younger ones retired\r\nto their beds, and soon slept soundly. Fritz, the eldest, watched with\r\nme. “I have been considering,” said he, “how we could save ourselves. If\r\nwe only had some cork jackets, or bladders, for mamma and my brothers,\r\nyou and I don’t need them, we could then swim to land.”\r\n\r\n“A good thought,” said I, “I will try during the night to contrive some\r\nexpedient to secure our safety.” We found some small empty barrels in\r\nthe cabin, which we tied two together with our handkerchiefs, leaving a\r\nspace between for each child; and fastened this new swimming apparatus\r\nunder their arms. My wife prepared the same for herself. We then\r\ncollected some knives, string, tinder-box, and such little necessaries\r\nas we could put in our pockets; thus, in case the vessel should fall to\r\npieces during the night, we hoped we might be enabled to reach land.\r\n\r\nAt length Fritz, overcome with fatigue, lay down and slept with his\r\nbrothers. My wife and I, too anxious to rest, spent that dreadful night\r\nin prayer, and in arranging various plans. How gladly we welcomed the\r\nlight of day, shining through an opening. The wind was subsiding, the\r\nsky serene, and I watched the sun rise with renewed hope. I called my\r\nwife and children on deck. The younger ones were surprised to find we\r\nwere alone. They inquired what had become of the sailors, and how we\r\nshould manage the ship alone.\r\n\r\n“Children,” said I, “one more powerful than man has protected us till\r\nnow, and will still extend a saving arm to us, if we do not give way to\r\ncomplaint and despair. Let all hands set to work. Remember that\r\nexcellent maxim, God helps those who help themselves. Let us all\r\nconsider what is best to do now.”\r\n\r\n“Let us leap into the sea,” cried Fritz, “and swim to the shore.”\r\n\r\n“Very well for you,” replied Ernest, “who can swim; but we should be all\r\ndrowned. Would it not be better to construct a raft and go all\r\ntogether?”\r\n\r\n“That might do,” added I, “if we were strong enough for such a work, and\r\nif a raft was not always so dangerous a conveyance. But away, boys,\r\nlook about you, and seek for anything that may be useful to us.”\r\n\r\nWe all dispersed to different parts of the vessel. For my own part I\r\nwent to the provision-room, to look after the casks of water and other\r\nnecessaries of life; my wife visited the live stock and fed them, for\r\nthey were almost famished; Fritz sought for arms and ammunition; Ernest\r\nfor the carpenter’s tools. Jack had opened the captain’s cabin, and was\r\nimmediately thrown down by two large dogs, who leaped on him so roughly\r\nthat he cried out as if they were going to devour him. However, hunger\r\nhad rendered them so docile that they licked his hands, and he soon\r\nrecovered his feet, seized the largest by the ears, and mounting his\r\nback, gravely rode up to me as I was coming from the hold. I could not\r\nhelp laughing; I applauded his courage; but recommended him always to be\r\nprudent with animals of that kind, who are often dangerous when hungry.\r\n\r\nMy little troop began to assemble. Fritz had found two fowling-pieces,\r\nsome bags of powder and shot, and some balls, in horn flasks. Ernest was\r\nloaded with an axe and hammer, a pair of pincers, a large pair of\r\nscissors, and an auger showed itself half out of his pocket.\r\n\r\nFrancis had a large box under his arm, from which he eagerly produced\r\nwhat he called little pointed hooks. His brothers laughed at his prize.\r\n“Silence,” said I, “the youngest has made the most valuable addition to\r\nour stores. These are fish-hooks, and may be more useful for the\r\npreservation of our lives than anything the ship contains. However,\r\nFritz and Ernest have not done amiss.”\r\n\r\n“For my part,” said my wife, “I only contribute good news; I have\r\nfound a cow, an ass, two goats, six sheep, and a sow with young. I have\r\nfed them, and hope we may preserve them.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said I to my little workmen, “I am satisfied with all but\r\nMaster Jack, who, instead of anything useful, has contributed two great\r\neaters, who will do us more harm than good.”\r\n\r\n“They can help us to hunt when we get to land,” said Jack.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied I, “but can you devise any means of our getting there?”\r\n\r\n“It does not seem at all difficult,” said the spirited little fellow;\r\n“put us each into a great tub, and let us float to shore. I remember\r\nsailing capitally that way on godpapa’s great pond at S—.”\r\n\r\n“A very good idea, Jack; good counsel may sometimes be given even by a\r\nchild. Be quick, boys, give me the saw and auger, with some nails, we\r\nwill see what we can do.” I remembered seeing some empty casks in the\r\nhold. We went down and found them floating. This gave us less difficulty\r\nin getting them upon the lower deck, which was but just above the water.\r\nThey were of strong wood, bound with iron hoops, and exactly suited my\r\npurpose; my sons and I therefore began to saw them through the middle.\r\nAfter long labour, we had eight tubs all the same height. We refreshed\r\nourselves with wine and biscuit, which we had found in some of the\r\ncasks. I then contemplated with delight my little squadron of boats\r\nranged in a line; and was surprised that my wife still continued\r\ndepressed. She looked mournfully on them. “I can never venture in one of\r\nthese tubs,” said she.\r\n\r\n“Wait a little, till my work is finished,” replied I, “and you will see\r\nit is more to be depended on than this broken vessel.”\r\n\r\nI sought out a long flexible plank, and arranged eight tubs on it, close\r\nto each other, leaving a piece at each end to form a curve upwards, like\r\nthe keel of a vessel. We then nailed them firmly to the plank, and to\r\neach other. We nailed a plank at each side, of the same length as the\r\nfirst, and succeeded in producing a sort of boat, divided into eight\r\ncompartments, in which it did not appear difficult to make a short\r\nvoyage, over a calm sea.\r\n\r\nBut, unluckily, our wonderful vessel proved so heavy, that our united\r\nefforts could not move it an inch. I sent Fritz to bring me the\r\njack-screw, and, in the mean time, sawed a thick round pole into pieces;\r\nthen raising the fore-part of our work by means of the powerful machine,\r\nFritz placed one of these rollers under it.\r\n\r\nErnest was very anxious to know how this small machine could accomplish\r\nmore than our united strength. I explained to him, as well as I could,\r\nthe power of the lever of Archimedes, with which he had declared he\r\ncould move the world, if he had but a point to rest it on; and I\r\npromised my son to take the machine to pieces when we were on shore, and\r\nexplain the mode of operation. I then told them that God, to compensate\r\nfor the weakness of man, had bestowed on him reason, invention, and\r\nskill in workmanship. The result of these had produced a science which,\r\nunder the name of _Mechanics_, taught us to increase and extend our\r\nlimited powers incredibly by the aid of instruments.\r\n\r\nJack remarked that the jack-screw worked very slowly.\r\n\r\n“Better slowly, than not at all,” said I. “It is a principle in\r\nmechanics, that what is gained in time is lost in power. The jack is not\r\nmeant to work rapidly, but to raise heavy weights; and the heavier the\r\nweight, the slower the operation. But, can you tell me how we can make\r\nup for this slowness?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, by turning the handle quicker, to be sure!”\r\n\r\n“Quite wrong; that would not aid us at all. Patience and Reason are the\r\ntwo fairies, by whose potent help I hope to get our boat afloat.”\r\n\r\nI quickly proceeded to tie a strong cord to the after-part of it, and\r\nthe other end to a beam in the ship, which was still firm, leaving it\r\nlong enough for security; then introducing two more rollers underneath,\r\nand working with the jack, we succeeded in launching our bark, which\r\npassed into the water with such velocity, that but for our rope it would\r\nhave gone out to sea. Unfortunately, it leaned so much on one side, that\r\nnone of the boys would venture into it. I was in despair, when I\r\nsuddenly remembered it only wanted ballast to keep it in equilibrium. I\r\nhastily threw in anything I got hold of that was heavy, and soon had my\r\nboat level, and ready for occupation. They now contended who should\r\nenter first; but I stopped them, reflecting that these restless children\r\nmight easily capsize our vessel. I remembered that savage nations made\r\nuse of an out-rigger, to prevent their canoe oversetting, and this I\r\ndetermined to add to my work. I fixed two portions of a topsail-yard,\r\none over the prow, the other across the stern, in such a manner that\r\nthey should not be in the way in pushing off our boat from the wreck. I\r\nforced the end of each yard into the bunghole of an empty brandy-cask,\r\nto keep them steady during our progress.\r\n\r\nIt was now necessary to clear the way for our departure. I got into the\r\nfirst tub, and managed to get the boat into the cleft in the ship’s\r\nside, by way of a haven; I then returned, and, with the axe and saw, cut\r\naway right and left all that could obstruct our passage. Then we secured\r\nsome oars, to be ready for our voyage next day.\r\n\r\nThe day had passed in toil, and we were compelled to spend another night\r\non the wreck, though we knew it might not remain till morning. We took a\r\nregular meal, for during the day we had scarcely had time to snatch a\r\nmorsel of bread and a glass of wine. More composed than on the preceding\r\nnight, we retired to rest. I took the precaution to fasten the swimming\r\napparatus across the shoulders of my three younger children and my wife,\r\nfor fear another storm might destroy the vessel, and cast us into the\r\nsea. I also advised my wife to put on a sailor’s dress, as more\r\nconvenient for her expected toils and trials. She reluctantly consented,\r\nand, after a short absence, appeared in the dress of a youth who had\r\nserved as a volunteer in the vessel. She felt very timid and awkward in\r\nher new dress; but I showed her the advantage of the change, and, at\r\nlast, she was reconciled, and joined in the laughter of the children at\r\nher strange disguise. She then got into her hammock, and we enjoyed a\r\npleasant sleep, to prepare us for new labours.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt break of day we were awake and ready, and after morning prayer, I\r\naddressed my children thus: “We are now, my dear boys, with the help of\r\nGod, about to attempt our deliverance. Before we go, provide our poor\r\nanimals with food for some days: we cannot take them with us, but if our\r\nvoyage succeed, we may return for them. Are you ready? Collect what you\r\nwish to carry away, but only things absolutely necessary for our actual\r\nwants.” I planned that our first cargo should consist of a barrel of\r\npowder, three fowling-pieces, three muskets, two pair of pocket pistols,\r\nand one pair larger, ball, shot, and lead as much as we could carry,\r\nwith a bullet-mould; and I wished each of my sons, as well as their\r\nmother, should have a complete game-bag, of which there were several in\r\nthe officers’ cabins. We then set apart a box of portable soup, another\r\nof biscuit, an iron pot, a fishing-rod, a chest of nails, and one of\r\ncarpenter’s tools, also some sailcloth to make a tent. In fact my boys\r\ncollected so many things, we were compelled to leave some behind, though\r\nI exchanged all the useless ballast for necessaries.\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready, we implored the blessing of God on our undertaking,\r\nand prepared to embark in our tubs. At this moment the cocks crowed a\r\nsort of reproachful farewell to us; we had forgotten them; I immediately\r\nproposed to take our poultry with us, geese, ducks, fowls and pigeons,\r\nfor, as I observed to my wife, if we could not feed them, they would, at\r\nany rate, feed us. We placed our ten hens and two cocks in a covered\r\ntub; the rest we set at liberty, hoping the geese and ducks might reach\r\nthe shore by water, and the pigeons by flight.\r\n\r\nWe waited a little for my wife, who came loaded with a large bag, which\r\nshe threw into the tub that contained her youngest son. I concluded it\r\nwas intended to steady him, or for a seat, and made no observation on\r\nit. Here follows the order of our embarkation. In the first division,\r\nsat the tender mother, the faithful and pious wife. In the second, our\r\namiable little Francis, six years old, and of a sweet disposition.\r\n\r\nIn the third, Fritz, our eldest, fourteen or fifteen years old, a\r\ncurly-headed, clever, intelligent and lively youth.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth, the powder-cask, with the fowls and the sailcloth.\r\n\r\nOur provisions filled the fifth.\r\n\r\nIn the sixth, our heedless Jack, ten years old, enterprising, bold, and\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh, Ernest, twelve years of age, well-informed and rational,\r\nbut somewhat selfish and indolent. In the eighth, myself, an anxious\r\nfather, charged with the important duty of guiding the vessel to save my\r\ndear family. Each of us had some useful tools beside us; each held an\r\noar, and had a swimming apparatus at hand, in case we were unfortunately\r\nupset. The tide was rising when we left, which I considered might assist\r\nmy weak endeavours. We turned our out-riggers length-ways, and thus\r\npassed from the cleft of the ship into the open sea. We rowed with all\r\nour might, to reach the blue land we saw at a distance, but for some\r\ntime in vain, as the boat kept turning round, and made no progress. At\r\nlast I contrived to steer it, so that we went straight forward.\r\n\r\nAs soon as our dogs saw us depart, they leaped into the sea, and\r\nfollowed us; I could not let them get into the boat, for fear they\r\nshould upset it. I was very sorry, for I hardly expected they would be\r\nable to swim to land; but by occasionally resting their forepaws on our\r\nout-riggers, they managed to keep up with us. Turk was an English dog,\r\nand Flora of a Danish breed.\r\n\r\nWe proceeded slowly, but safely. The nearer we approached the land, the\r\nmore dreary and unpromising it appeared. The rocky coast seemed to\r\nannounce to us nothing but famine and misery. The waves, gently rippling\r\nagainst the shore, were scattered over with barrels, bales, and chests\r\nfrom the wreck. Hoping to secure some good provisions, I called on Fritz\r\nfor assistance; he held a cord, hammer, and nails, and we managed to\r\nseize two hogsheads in passing, and fastening them with cords to our\r\nvessel, drew them after us to the shore.\r\n\r\nAs we approached, the coast seemed to improve. The chain of rock was not\r\nentire, and Fritz’s hawk eye made out some trees, which he declared were\r\nthe cocoa-nut tree; Ernest was delighted at the prospect of eating these\r\nnuts, so much larger and better than any grown in Europe. I was\r\nregretting not having brought the large telescope from the captain’s\r\ncabin, when Jack produced from his pocket a smaller one, which he\r\noffered me with no little pride.\r\n\r\nThis was a valuable acquisition, as I was now enabled to make the\r\nrequisite observations, and direct my course. The coast before us had a\r\nwild and desert appearance,—it looked better towards the left; but I\r\ncould not approach that part, for a current which drove us towards the\r\nrocky and barren shore. At length we saw, near the mouth of a rivulet, a\r\nlittle creek between the rocks, towards which our geese and ducks made,\r\nserving us for guides. This opening formed a little bay of smooth water,\r\njust deep enough for our boat. I cautiously entered it, and landed at a\r\nplace where the coast was about the height of our tubs, and the water\r\ndeep enough to let us approach. The shore spread inland, forming a\r\ngentle declivity of a triangular form, the point lost among the rocks,\r\nand the base to the sea.\r\n\r\nAll that were able leaped on shore in a moment. Even little Francis, who\r\nhad been laid down in his tub, like a salted herring, tried to crawl\r\nout, but was compelled to wait for his mother’s assistance. The dogs,\r\nwho had preceded us in landing, welcomed us in a truly friendly manner,\r\nleaping playfully around us; the geese kept up a loud cackling, to which\r\nthe yellow-billed ducks quacked a powerful bass. This, with the clacking\r\nof the liberated fowls, and the chattering of the boys, formed a perfect\r\nBabel; mingled with these, were the harsh cries of the penguins and\r\nflamingoes, which hovered over our heads, or sat on the points of the\r\nrocks. They were in immense numbers, and their notes almost deafened us,\r\nespecially as they did not accord with the harmony of our civilized\r\nfowls. However I rejoiced to see these feathered creatures, already\r\nfancying them on my table, if we were obliged to remain in this\r\ndesert region.\r\n\r\nOur first care, when we stepped in safety on land, was to kneel down\r\nand thank God, to whom we owed our lives; and to resign ourselves wholly\r\nto his Fatherly kindness.\r\n\r\nWe then began to unload our vessel. How rich we thought ourselves with\r\nthe little we had saved! We sought a convenient place for our tent,\r\nunder the shade of the rocks. We then inserted a pole into a fissure in\r\nthe rock; this, resting firmly on another pole fixed in the ground,\r\nformed the frame of the tent. The sailcloth was then stretched over it,\r\nand fastened down at proper distances, by pegs, to which, for greater\r\nsecurity, we added some boxes of provision; we fixed some hooks to the\r\ncanvas at the opening in front, that we might close the entrance during\r\nthe night. I sent my sons to seek some moss and withered grass, and\r\nspread it in the sun to dry, to form our beds; and while all, even\r\nlittle Francis, were busy with this, I constructed a sort of\r\ncooking-place, at some distance from the tent, near the river which was\r\nto supply us with fresh water. It was merely a hearth of flat stones\r\nfrom the bed of the stream, fenced round with some thick branches. I\r\nkindled a cheerful fire with some dry twigs, put on the pot, filled with\r\nwater and some squares of portable soup, and left my wife, with Francis\r\nfor assistant, to prepare dinner. He took the portable soup for glue,\r\nand could not conceive how mamma could make soup, as we had no meat, and\r\nthere were no butchers’ shops here.\r\n\r\nFritz, in the mean time, had loaded our guns. He took one to the side of\r\nthe river; Ernest declined accompanying him, as the rugged road was not\r\nto his taste; he preferred the sea-shore. Jack proceeded to a ridge of\r\nrocks on the left, which ran towards the sea, to get some mussles. I\r\nwent to try and draw the two floating hogsheads on shore, but could not\r\nsucceed, for our landing-place was too steep to get them up. Whilst I\r\nwas vainly trying to find a more favourable place, I heard my dear Jack\r\nuttering most alarming cries. I seized my hatchet, and ran to his\r\nassistance. I found him up to the knees in a shallow pool, with a large\r\nlobster holding his leg in its sharp claws. It made off at my approach;\r\nbut I was determined it should pay for the fright it had given me.\r\nCautiously taking it up, I brought it out, followed by Jack, who, now\r\nvery triumphant, wished to present it himself to his mother, after\r\nwatching how I held it. But he had hardly got it into his hands, when it\r\ngave him such a violent blow on the cheek with its tail, that he let it\r\nfall, and began to cry again. I could not help laughing at him, and, in\r\nhis rage, he seized a stone, and put an end to his adversary. I was\r\ngrieved at this, and recommended him never to act in a moment of anger,\r\nshowing him that he was unjust in being so revengeful; for, if he had\r\nbeen bitten by the lobster, it was plain he would have eaten his foe if\r\nhe had conquered him. Jack promised to be more discreet and merciful in\r\nfuture, and obtained leave to bear the prize to his mother.\r\n\r\n“Mamma,” said he, proudly, “a lobster! A lobster, Ernest! Where is\r\nFritz! Take care it does not bite you, Francis!” They all crowded round\r\nin astonishment. “Yes,” added he, triumphantly, “here is the impertinent\r\nclaw that seized me; but I repaid the knave,”\r\n\r\n“You are a boaster,” said I. “You would have got indifferently on with\r\nthe lobster, if I had not come up; and have you forgotten the slap on\r\nthe cheek which compelled you to release him? Besides, he only defended\r\nhimself with his natural arms; but you had to take a great stone. You\r\nhave no reason to be proud, Jack.”\r\n\r\nErnest wished to have the lobster added to the soup to improve it; but\r\nhis mother, with a spirit of economy, reserved it for another day. I\r\nthen walked to the spot where Jack’s lobster was caught, and, finding it\r\nfavourable for my purpose, drew my two hogsheads on shore there, and\r\nsecured them by turning them on end.\r\n\r\nOn returning, I congratulated Jack on being the first who had been\r\nsuccessful in foraging. Ernest remarked, that he had seen some oysters\r\nattached to a rock, but could not get at them without wetting his feet,\r\nwhich he did not like.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, my delicate gentleman!” said I, laughing, “I must trouble you\r\nto return and procure us some. We must all unite in working for the\r\npublic good, regardless of wet feet. The sun will soon dry us.”\r\n\r\n“I might as well bring some salt at the same time,” said he; “I saw\r\nplenty in the fissures of the rock, left by the sea, I should\r\nthink, papa?”\r\n\r\n“Doubtless, Mr. Reasoner,” replied I; “where else could it have come\r\nfrom? the fact was so obvious, that you had better have brought a\r\nbagful, than delayed to reflect about it. But if you wish to escape\r\ninsipid soup, be quick and procure some.”\r\n\r\nHe went, and returned with some salt, so mixed with sand and earth, that\r\nI should have thrown it away as useless; but my wife dissolved it in\r\nfresh water, and, filtering it through a piece of canvas, managed to\r\nflavour our soup with it.\r\n\r\nJack asked why we could not have used sea-water; and I explained to him\r\nthat the bitter and nauseous taste of sea-water would have spoiled our\r\ndinner. My wife stirred the soup with a little stick, and, tasting it,\r\npronounced it very good, but added, “We must wait for Fritz. And how\r\nshall we eat our soup without plates or spoons? We cannot possibly raise\r\nthis large boiling pot to our heads, and drink out of it.”\r\n\r\nIt was too true. We gazed stupified at our pot, and, at last, all burst\r\ninto laughter at our destitution, and our folly in forgetting such\r\nuseful necessaries.\r\n\r\n“If we only had cocoa-nuts,” said Ernest, “we might split them, and make\r\nbasins and spoons.”\r\n\r\n“_If_!” replied I—“but we have none! We might as well wish for a dozen\r\nhandsome silver spoons at once, if wishes were of any use.”\r\n\r\n“But,” observed he, “we can use oyster-shells.”\r\n\r\n“A useful thought, Ernest; go directly and get the oysters; and,\r\nremember, gentlemen, no complaints, though the spoons are without\r\nhandles, and you should dip your fingers into the bowl.”\r\n\r\nOff ran Jack, and was mid-leg in the water before Ernest got to him. He\r\ntore down the oysters, and threw them to his idle brother, who filled\r\nhis handkerchief, taking care to put a large one into his pocket for his\r\nown use; and they returned with their spoil.\r\n\r\nFritz had not yet appeared, and his mother was becoming uneasy, when we\r\nheard him cheerfully hailing us at a distance. He soon came up, with a\r\nfeigned air of disappointment, and his hands behind him; but Jack, who\r\nhad glided round him, cried out, “A sucking pig! a sucking pig!” And he\r\nthen, with, great pride and satisfaction, produced his booty, which I\r\nrecognized, from the description of travellers, to be the _agouti_,\r\ncommon in these regions, a swift animal, which burrows in the earth, and\r\nlives on fruits and nuts; its flesh, something like that of the rabbit,\r\nhas an unpleasant flavour to Europeans.\r\n\r\nAll were anxious to know the particulars of the chase; but I seriously\r\nreproved my son for his little fiction, and warned him never to use the\r\nleast deceit, even in jest. I then inquired where he had met with the\r\nagouti. He told me he had been on the other side of the river, “a very\r\ndifferent place to this,” continued he. “The shore lies low, and you can\r\nhave no idea of the number of casks, chests, planks, and all sorts of\r\nthings the sea has thrown up; shall we go and take possession of them?\r\nAnd to-morrow, father, we ought to make another trip to the vessel, to\r\nlook after our cattle. We might, at least, bring away the cow. Our\r\nbiscuit would not be so hard dipped in milk.”\r\n\r\n“And very much nicer,” added the greedy Ernest.\r\n\r\n“Then,” continued Fritz, “beyond the river there is rich grass for\r\npasturage, and a shady wood. Why should we remain in this barren\r\nwilderness?”\r\n\r\n“Softly!” replied I, “there is a time for all things. To-morrow, and the\r\nday after to-morrow will have their work. But first tell me, did you see\r\nanything of our shipmates?”\r\n\r\n“Not a trace of man, living or dead, on land or sea; but I saw an animal\r\nmore like a hog than this, but with feet like a hare; it leaped among\r\nthe grass, sometimes sitting upright, and rubbing its mouth with its\r\nforepaws; sometimes seeking for roots, and gnawing them like a\r\nsquirrel. If I had not been afraid it would escape me, I would have\r\ntried to take it alive, it seemed so very tame.”\r\n\r\nAs we were talking, Jack had been trying, with many grimaces, to force\r\nan oyster open with his knife. I laughed at his vain endeavours, and\r\nputting some on the fire, showed him them open of themselves. I had no\r\ntaste for oysters myself; but as they are everywhere accounted a\r\ndelicacy, I advised my sons to try them. They all at first declined the\r\nunattractive repast, except Jack, who, with great courage, closed his\r\neyes, and desperately swallowed one as if it had been medicine. The rest\r\nfollowed his example, and then all agreed with me that oysters were not\r\ngood. The shells were soon plunged into the pot to bring out some of the\r\ngood soup; but scalding their fingers, it was who could cry out the\r\nloudest. Ernest took his large shell from his pocket, cautiously filled\r\nit with a good portion of soup, and set it down to cool, exulting in his\r\nown prudence. “You have been very thoughtful, my dear Ernest,” said I;\r\n“but why are your thoughts always for yourself; so seldom for others? As\r\na punishment for your egotism, that portion must be given to our\r\nfaithful dogs. We can all dip our shells into the pot, the dogs cannot.\r\nTherefore, they shall have your soup, and you must wait, and eat as we\r\ndo.” My reproach struck his heart, and he placed his shell obediently on\r\nthe ground, which the dogs emptied immediately. We were almost as\r\nhungry as they were, and were watching anxiously till the soup began to\r\ncool; when we perceived that the dogs were tearing and gnawing Fritz’s\r\nagouti. The boys all cried out; Fritz was in a fury, took his gun,\r\nstruck the dogs, called them names, threw stones at them, and would have\r\nkilled them if I had not held him. He had actually bent his gun with\r\nstriking them. As soon as he would listen to me, I reproached him\r\nseriously for his violence, and represented to him how much he had\r\ndistressed us, and terrified his mother; that he had spoiled his gun,\r\nwhich might have been so useful to us, and had almost killed the poor\r\nanimals, who might be more so. “Anger,” said I, “leads to every crime.\r\nRemember Cain, who killed his brother in a fit of passion.” “Oh,\r\nfather!” said he, in a voice of terror; and, acknowledging his error, he\r\nasked pardon, and shed bitter tears.\r\n\r\nSoon after our repast the sun set, and the fowls gathered round us, and\r\npicked up the scattered crumbs of biscuit. My wife then took out her\r\nmysterious bag, and drew from it some handfuls of grain to feed her\r\nflock. She showed me also many other seeds of useful vegetables. I\r\npraised her prudence, and begged her to be very economical, as these\r\nseeds were of great value, and we could bring from the vessel some\r\nspoiled biscuit for the fowls.\r\n\r\nOur pigeons now flew among the rocks, the cocks and hens perched on the\r\nframe of the tent, and the geese and ducks chose to roost in a marsh,\r\ncovered with bushes, near the sea. We prepared for our rest; we loaded\r\nall our arms, then offered up our prayers together, thanking God for\r\nhis signal mercy to us, and commending ourselves to his care. When the\r\nlast ray of light departed, we closed our tent, and lay down on our\r\nbeds, close together. The children had remarked how suddenly the\r\ndarkness came on, from which I concluded we were not far from the\r\nequator; for I explained to them, the more perpendicularly the rays of\r\nthe sun fall, the less their refraction; and consequently night comes on\r\nsuddenly when the sun is below the horizon.\r\n\r\nOnce more I looked out to see if all was quiet, then carefully closing\r\nthe entrance, I lay down. Warm as the day had been, the night was so\r\ncold that we were obliged to crowd together for warmth. The children\r\nsoon slept, and when I saw their mother in her first peaceful sleep, my\r\nown eyes closed, and our first night on the island passed comfortably.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt break of day I was waked by the crowing of the cock. I summoned my\r\nwife to council, to consider on the business of the day. We agreed that\r\nour first duty was to seek for our shipmates, and to examine the country\r\nbeyond the river before we came to any decisive resolution.\r\n\r\nMy wife saw we could not all go on this expedition, and courageously\r\nagreed to remain with her three youngest sons, while Fritz, as the\r\neldest and boldest, should accompany me. I begged her to prepare\r\nbreakfast immediately, which she warned me would be scanty, as no soup\r\nwas provided. I asked for Jack’s lobster; but it was not to be found.\r\nWhilst my wife made the fire, and put on the pot, I called the children,\r\nand asking Jack for the lobster, he brought it from a crevice in the\r\nrock, where he had hidden it from the dogs, he said, who did not despise\r\nanything eatable.\r\n\r\n“I am glad to see you profit by the misfortunes of others,” said I; “and\r\nnow will you give up that large claw that caught your leg, and which I\r\npromised you, to Fritz, as a provision for his journey?” All were\r\nanxious to go on this journey, and leaped round me like little kids. But\r\nI told them we could not all go. They must remain with their mother,\r\nwith Flora for a protector. Fritz and I would take Turk; with him and a\r\nloaded gun I thought we should inspire respect. I then ordered Fritz to\r\ntie up Flora, and get the guns ready.\r\n\r\nFritz blushed, and tried in vain to straighten his crooked gun. I let\r\nhim go on for some time, and then allowed him to take another; for I saw\r\nhe was penitent. The dogs, too, snarled, and would not let him approach\r\nthem. He wept, and begged some biscuit from his mother, declaring he\r\nwould give up his own breakfast to make his peace with the dogs. He fed\r\nthem, caressed them, and seemed to ask pardon. The dog is always\r\ngrateful; Flora soon licked his hands; Turk was more unrelenting,\r\nappearing to distrust him. “Give him a claw of the lobster,” said Jack;\r\n“for I make you a present of the whole for your journey.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t be uneasy about them,” said Ernest, “they will certainly meet\r\nwith cocoa-nuts, as Robinson did, very different food to your wretched\r\nlobster. Think of an almond as big as my head, with a large cup full of\r\nrich milk.”\r\n\r\n“Pray, brother, bring me one, if you find any,” said Francis.\r\n\r\nWe began our preparation; we each took a game-bag and a hatchet. I gave\r\nFritz a pair of pistols in addition to his gun, equipped myself in the\r\nsame way, and took care to carry biscuit and a flask of fresh water. The\r\nlobster proved so hard at breakfast, that the boys did not object to our\r\ncarrying off the remainder; and, though the flesh is coarse, it is very\r\nnutritious.\r\n\r\nI proposed before we departed, to have prayers, and my thoughtless Jack\r\nbegan to imitate the sound of church-bells—“Ding, dong! to prayers! to\r\nprayers! ding, dong!” I was really angry, and reproved him severely for\r\njesting about sacred things. Then, kneeling down, I prayed God’s\r\nblessing on our undertaking, and his pardon for us all, especially for\r\nhim who had now so grievously sinned. Poor Jack came and kneeled by me,\r\nweeping and begging for forgiveness from me and from God. I embraced\r\nhim, and enjoined him and his brothers to obey their mother. I then\r\nloaded the guns I left with them, and charged my wife to keep near the\r\nboat, their best refuge. We took leave of our friends with many tears,\r\nas we did not know what dangers might assail us in an unknown region.\r\nBut the murmur of the river, which we were now approaching, drowned the\r\nsound of their sobs, and we bent our thoughts on our journey.\r\n\r\nThe bank of the river was so steep, that we could only reach the bed at\r\none little opening, near the sea, where we had procured our water; but\r\nhere the opposite side was guarded by a ridge of lofty perpendicular\r\nrocks. We were obliged to ascend the river to a place where it fell over\r\nsome rocks, some fragments of which having fallen, made a sort of\r\nstepping-stones, which enabled us to cross with some hazard. We made our\r\nway, with difficulty, through the high grass, withered by the sun,\r\ndirecting our course towards the sea, in hopes of discovering some\r\ntraces of the boats, or the crew. We had scarcely gone a hundred yards,\r\nwhen we heard a loud noise and rustling in the grass, which was as tall\r\nas we were. We imagined we were pursued by some wild beast, and I was\r\ngratified to observe the courage of Fritz, who, instead of running away,\r\ncalmly turned round and presented his piece. What was our joy when we\r\ndiscovered that the formidable enemy was only our faithful Turk, whom we\r\nhad forgotten in our distress, and our friends had doubtless dispatched\r\nhim after us! I applauded my son’s presence of mind; a rash act might\r\nhave deprived us of this valuable friend.\r\n\r\nWe continued our way: the sea lay to our left; on our right, at a short\r\ndistance, ran the chain of rocks, which were continued from our\r\nlanding-place, in a line parallel to the sea; the summits clothed with\r\nverdure and various trees. Between the rocks and the sea, several little\r\nwoods extended, even to the shore, to which we kept as close as\r\npossible, vainly looking out on land or sea for any trace of our crew.\r\nFritz proposed to fire his gun, as a signal to them, if they should be\r\nnear us; but I reminded him that this signal might bring the ravages\r\nround us, instead of our friends.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “We rested in the shade, near a clear stream, and took\r\nsome refreshment.”]\r\n\r\nHe then inquired why we should search after those persons at all, who\r\nso unfeelingly abandoned us on the wreck.\r\n\r\n“First,” said I, “we must not return evil for evil. Besides, they may\r\nassist us, or be in need of our assistance. Above all, remember, they\r\ncould save nothing but themselves. We have got many useful things which\r\nthey have as much right to as we.”\r\n\r\n“But we might be saving the lives of our cattle,” said he.\r\n\r\n“We should do our duty better by saving the life of a man,” answered I;\r\n“besides, our cattle have food for some days, and the sea is so calm\r\nthere is no immediate danger.”\r\n\r\nWe proceeded, and entering a little wood that extended to the sea, we\r\nrested in the shade, near a clear stream, and took some refreshment. We\r\nwere surrounded by unknown birds, more remarkable for brilliant plumage\r\nthan for the charm of their voice. Fritz thought he saw some monkeys\r\namong the leaves, and Turk began to be restless, smelling about, and\r\nbarking very loud. Fritz was gazing up into the trees, when he fell over\r\na large round substance, which he brought to me, observing that it might\r\nbe a bird’s nest. I thought it more likely to be a cocoa-nut. The\r\nfibrous covering had reminded him of the description he had read of the\r\nnests of certain birds; but, on breaking the shell, we found it was\r\nindeed a cocoa-nut, but quite decayed and uneatable.\r\n\r\nFritz was astonished; where was the sweet milk that Ernest had talked\r\nof?\r\n\r\nI told him the milk was only in the half-ripe nuts; that it thickened\r\nand hardened as the nut ripened, becoming a kernel. This nut had\r\nperished from remaining above ground. If it had been in the earth, it\r\nwould have vegetated, and burst the shell. I advised my son to try if he\r\ncould not find a perfect nut.\r\n\r\nAfter some search, we found one, and sat down to eat it, keeping our own\r\nprovision for dinner. The nut was somewhat rancid; but we enjoyed it,\r\nand then continued our journey. We were some time before we got through\r\nthe wood, being frequently obliged to clear a road for ourselves,\r\nthrough the entangled brushwood, with our hatchets. At last we entered\r\nthe open plain again, and had a clear view before us. The forest still\r\nextended about a stone’s throw to our right, and Fritz, who was always\r\non the look-out for discoveries, observed a remarkable tree, here and\r\nthere, which he approached to examine; and he soon called me to see this\r\nwonderful tree, with wens growing on the trunk.\r\n\r\nOn coming up, I was overjoyed to find this tree, of which there were a\r\ngreat number, was the gourd-tree, which bears fruit on the trunk. Fritz\r\nasked if these were sponges. I told him to bring me one, and I would\r\nexplain the mystery.\r\n\r\n“There is one,” said he, “very like a pumpkin, only harder outside.”\r\n\r\n“Of this shell,” said I, “we can make plates, dishes, basins, and\r\nflasks. We call it the gourd-tree.”\r\n\r\nFritz leaped for joy. “Now my dear mother will be able to serve her soup\r\nproperly.” I asked him if he knew why the tree bore the fruit on its\r\ntrunk, or on the thick branches only. He immediately replied, that the\r\nsmaller branches would not bear the weight of the fruit. He asked me if\r\nthis fruit was eatable. “Harmless, I believe,” said I; “but by no means\r\ndelicate. Its great value to savage nations consists in the shell, which\r\nthey use to contain their food, and drink, and even cook in it.” Fritz\r\ncould not comprehend how they could cook in the shell without burning\r\nit. I told him the shell was not placed on the fire; but, being filled\r\nwith cold water, and the fish or meat placed in it, red-hot stones are,\r\nby degrees, introduced into the water, till it attains sufficient heat\r\nto cook the food, without injuring the vessel. We then set about making\r\nour dishes and plates. I showed Fritz a better plan of dividing the\r\ngourd than with a knife. I tied a string tightly round the nut, struck\r\nit with the handle of my knife till an incision was made, then tightened\r\nit till the nut was separated into two equally-sized bowls. Fritz had\r\nspoiled his gourd by cutting it irregularly with his knife. I advised\r\nhim to try and make spoons of it, as it would not do for basins now. I\r\ntold him I had learnt my plan from books of travels. It is the practice\r\nof the savages, who have no knives, to use a sort of string, made from\r\nthe bark of trees, for this purpose. “But how can they make bottles,”\r\nsaid he. “That requires some preparation,” replied I. “They tie a\r\nbandage round the young gourd near the stalk, so that the part at\r\nliberty expands in a round form, and the compressed part remains narrow.\r\nThey then open the top, and extract the contents by putting in pebbles\r\nand shaking it. By this means they have a complete bottle.”\r\n\r\nWe worked on. Fritz completed a dish and some plates, to his great\r\nsatisfaction, but we considered, that being so frail, we could not\r\ncarry them with us. We therefore filled them with sand, that the sun\r\nmight not warp them, and left them to dry, till we returned.\r\n\r\nAs we went on, Fritz amused himself with cutting spoons from the rind of\r\nthe gourd, and I tried to do the same with the fragments of the\r\ncocoa-nut; but I must confess my performances were inferior to those I\r\nhad seen in the museum in London, the work of the South Sea islanders.\r\nWe laughed at our spoons, which would have required mouths from ear to\r\near to eat with them. Fritz declared that the curve of the rind was the\r\ncause of that defect: if the spoons had been smaller, they would have\r\nbeen flat; and you might as well eat soup with an oyster-shell as with\r\na shovel.\r\n\r\nWhile we talked, we did not neglect looking about for our lost\r\ncompanions, but in vain. At last, we arrived at a place where a tongue\r\nof land ran to some distance into the sea, on which was an elevated\r\nspot, favourable for observation. We attained the summit with great\r\nlabour, and saw before us a magnificent prospect of land and water; but\r\nwith all the aid our excellent telescope gave us, we could in no\r\ndirection discover any trace of man. Nature only appeared in her\r\ngreatest beauty. The shore enclosed a large bay, which terminated on the\r\nother side in a promontory. The gentle rippling of the waves, the varied\r\nverdure of the woods, and the multitude of novelties around us, would\r\nhave filled us with delight, but for the painful recollection of those\r\nwho, we now were compelled to believe, were buried beneath that\r\nglittering water. We did not feel less, however, the mercy of God, who\r\nhad preserved us, and given us a home, with a prospect of subsistence\r\nand safety. We had not yet met with any dangerous animals, nor could we\r\nperceive any huts of savages. I remarked to my son that God seemed to\r\nhave destined us to a solitary life in this rich country, unless some\r\nvessel should reach these shores. “And His will be done!” added I; “it\r\nmust be for the best. Now let us retire to that pretty wood to rest\r\nourselves, and eat our dinner, before we return.”\r\n\r\nWe proceeded towards a pleasant wood of palm-trees; but before reaching\r\nit, had to pass through an immense number of reeds, which greatly\r\nobstructed our road. We were, moreover, fearful of treading on the\r\ndeadly serpents who choose such retreats. We made Turk walk before us to\r\ngive notice, and I cut a long, thick cane as a weapon of defence. I was\r\nsurprised to see a glutinous juice oozing from the end of the cut cane;\r\nI tasted it, and was convinced that we had met with a plantation of\r\nsugar-canes. I sucked more of it, and found myself singularly refreshed.\r\nI said nothing to Fritz, that he might have the pleasure of making the\r\ndiscovery himself. He was walking a few paces before me, and I called to\r\nhim to cut himself a cane like mine, which he did, and soon found out\r\nthe riches it contained. He cried out in ecstasy, “Oh, papa! papa! syrup\r\nof sugar-cane! delicious! How delighted will dear mamma, and my brothers\r\nbe, when I carry some to them!” He went on, sucking pieces of cane so\r\ngreedily, that I checked him, recommending moderation. He was then\r\ncontent to take some pieces to regale himself as he walked home, loading\r\nhimself with a huge burden for his mother and brothers. We now entered\r\nthe wood of palms to eat our dinner, when suddenly a number of monkeys,\r\nalarmed by our approach, and the barking of the dog, fled like lightning\r\nto the tops of the trees; and then grinned frightfully at us, with loud\r\ncries of defiance. As I saw the trees were cocoa-palms, I hoped to\r\nobtain, by means of the monkeys, a supply of the nuts in the half-ripe\r\nstate, when filled with milk. I held Fritz’s arm, who was preparing to\r\nshoot at them, to his great vexation, as he was irritated against the\r\npoor monkeys for their derisive gestures; but I told him, that though no\r\npatron of monkeys myself, I could not allow it. We had no right to kill\r\nany animal except in defence, or as a means of supporting life. Besides,\r\nthe monkeys would be of more use to us living than dead, as I would show\r\nhim. I began to throw stones at the monkeys, not being able, of course,\r\nto reach the place of their retreat, and they, in their anger, and in\r\nthe spirit of imitation, gathered the nuts and hurled them on us in such\r\nquantities, that we had some difficulty in escaping from them. We had\r\nsoon a large stock of cocoa-nuts. Fritz enjoyed the success of the\r\nstratagem, and, when the shower subsided, he collected as many as he\r\nwished. We then sat down, and tasted some of the milk through the three\r\nsmall holes, which we opened with our knives. We then divided some with\r\nour hatchets, and quenched our thirst with the liquor, which has not,\r\nhowever, a very agreeable flavour. We liked best a sort of thick cream\r\nwhich adheres to the shells, from which we scraped it with our spoons,\r\nand mixing it with the juice of the sugar-cane, we produced a delicious\r\ndish. Turk had the rest of the lobster, which we now despised, with\r\nsome biscuit.\r\n\r\nWe then got up, I tied some nuts together by their stems, and threw\r\nthem over my shoulder. Fritz took his bundle of canes, and we set out\r\nhomewards.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nFritz groaned heavily under the weight of his canes as we travelled on,\r\nand pitied the poor negroes, who had to carry such heavy burdens of\r\nthem. He then, in imitation of me, tried to refresh himself by sucking a\r\nsugar-cane, but was surprised to find he failed in extracting any of the\r\njuice. At last, after some reflection, he said, “Ah! I remember, if\r\nthere is no opening made for the air, I can get nothing out.” I\r\nrequested him to find a remedy for this.\r\n\r\n“I will make an opening,” said he, “above the first knot in the cane. If\r\nI draw in my breath in sucking, and thus make a vacuum in my mouth, the\r\nouter air then forces itself through the hole I have made to fill this\r\nvacuum, and carries the juice along with it; and when this division of\r\nthe cane is emptied, I can proceed to pierce above the next knot. I am\r\nonly afraid that going on this way we shall have nothing but empty canes\r\nto carry to our friends.” I told him, that I was more afraid the sun\r\nmight turn the syrup sour before we got our canes home; therefore we\r\nneed not spare them.\r\n\r\n“Well, at any rate,” said he, “I have filled my flask with the milk of\r\nthe cocoa-nut to regale them.”\r\n\r\nI told him I feared another disappointment; for the milk of the\r\ncocoa-nut, removed from the shell, spoiled sooner than the sugar-cane\r\njuice. I warned him that the milk, exposed to the sun in his tin flask,\r\nwas probably become vinegar.\r\n\r\nHe instantly took the bottle from his shoulder and uncorked it; when the\r\nliquor flew out with a report, foaming like champaign.\r\n\r\nI congratulated him on his new manufacture, and said, we must beware of\r\nintoxication.\r\n\r\n“Oh, taste, papa!” said he, “it is delicious, not at all like vinegar,\r\nbut capital new, sweet, sparkling wine. This will be the best treat, if\r\nit remains in this state.”\r\n\r\n“I fear it will not be so,” said I. “This is the first stage of\r\nfermentation. When this is over, and the liquor is cleared, it is a sort\r\nof wine, or fermented liquor, more or less agreeable, according to the\r\nmaterial used. By applying heat, a second, and slower fermentation\r\nsucceeds, and the liquor becomes vinegar. Then comes on a third stage,\r\nwhich deprives it of its strength, and spoils it. I fear, in this\r\nburning climate, you will carry home only vinegar, or something still\r\nmore offensive. But let us drink each other’s health now, but prudently,\r\nor we shall soon feel the effects of this potent beverage.” Perfectly\r\nrefreshed, we went on cheerfully to the place where we had left our\r\ngourd utensils. We found them quite dry, and hard as bone; we had no\r\ndifficulty in carrying them in our game-bags. We had scarcely got\r\nthrough the little wood where we had breakfasted, when Turk darted\r\nfuriously on a troop of monkeys, who were sporting about, and had not\r\nperceived him. He immediately seized a female, holding a young one in\r\nher arms, which impeded her flight, and had killed and devoured the poor\r\nmother before we could reach him. The young one had hidden itself among\r\nthe long grass, when Fritz arrived; he had run with all his might,\r\nlosing his hat, bottle, and canes, but could not prevent the murder of\r\nthe poor mother.\r\n\r\nThe little monkey no sooner saw him than it leaped upon his shoulders,\r\nfastening its paws in his curls, and neither cries, threats, nor shaking\r\ncould rid him of it. I ran up to him laughing, for I saw the little\r\ncreature could not hurt him, and tried in vain to disengage it. I told\r\nhim he must carry it thus. It was evident the sagacious little creature,\r\nhaving lost its mother, had adopted him for a father.\r\n\r\nI succeeded, at last, in quietly releasing him, and took the little\r\norphan, which was no bigger than a cat, in my arms, pitying its\r\nhelplessness. The mother appeared as tall as Fritz.\r\n\r\nI was reluctant to add another mouth to the number we had to feed; but\r\nFritz earnestly begged to keep it, offering to divide his share of\r\ncocoa-nut milk with it till we had our cows. I consented, on condition\r\nthat he took care of it, and taught it to be obedient to him.\r\n\r\nTurk, in the mean time, was feasting on the remains of the unfortunate\r\nmother. Fritz would have driven him off, but I saw we had not food\r\nsufficient to satisfy this voracious animal, and we might ourselves be\r\nin danger from his appetite.\r\n\r\nWe left him, therefore, with his prey, the little orphan sitting on the\r\nshoulder of his protector, while I carried the canes. Turk soon overtook\r\nus, and was received very coldly; we reproached him with his cruelty,\r\nbut he was quite unconcerned, and continued to walk after Fritz. The\r\nlittle monkey seemed uneasy at the sight of him, and crept into Fritz’s\r\nbosom, much to his inconvenience. But a thought struck him; he tied the\r\nmonkey with a cord to Turk’s back, leading the dog by another cord, as\r\nhe was very rebellious at first; but our threats and caresses at last\r\ninduced him to submit to his burden. We proceeded slowly, and I could\r\nnot help anticipating the mirth of my little ones, when they saw us\r\napproach like a pair of show-men.\r\n\r\nI advised Fritz not to correct the dogs for attacking and killing\r\nunknown animals. Heaven bestows the dog on man, as well as the horse,\r\nfor a friend and protector. Fritz thought we were very fortunate, then,\r\nin having two such faithful dogs; he only regretted that our horses had\r\ndied on the passage, and only left us the ass.\r\n\r\n“Let us not disdain the ass,” said I; “I wish we had him here; he is of\r\na very fine breed, and would be as useful as a horse to us.”\r\n\r\nIn such conversations, we arrived at the banks of our river before we\r\nwere aware. Flora barked to announce our approach, and Turk answered so\r\nloudly, that the terrified little monkey leaped from his back to the\r\nshoulder of its protector, and would not come down. Turk ran off to meet\r\nhis companion, and our dear family soon appeared on the opposite shore,\r\nshouting with joy at our happy return. We crossed at the same place as\r\nwe had done in the morning, and embraced each other. Then began such a\r\nnoise of exclamations. “A monkey! a real, live monkey! Ah! how\r\ndelightful! How glad we are! How did you catch him?”\r\n\r\n“He is very ugly,” said little Francis, who was almost afraid of him.\r\n\r\n“He is prettier than you are,” said Jack; “see how he laughs! how I\r\nshould like to see him eat!”\r\n\r\n“If we only had some cocoa-nuts,” said Ernest. “Have you found any, and\r\nare they good?”\r\n\r\n“Have you had any unpleasant adventures?” asked my wife.\r\n\r\nIt was in vain to attempt replying to so many questions and\r\nexclamations.\r\n\r\nAt length, when we got a little peace, I told them that, though I had\r\nbrought them all sorts of good things, I had, unfortunately, not met\r\nwith any of our companions.\r\n\r\n“God’s will be done!” said my wife; “let us thank Him for saving us, and\r\nagain bringing us together now. This day has seemed an age. But put down\r\nyour loads, and let us hear your adventures; we have not been idle, but\r\nwe are less fatigued than you. Boys, assist your father and brother.”\r\n\r\nJack took my gun, Ernest the cocoa-nuts, Francis the gourd-rinds, and my\r\nwife the game-bag. Fritz distributed his sugar-canes, and placed the\r\nmonkey on Turk’s back, to the amusement of the children. He begged\r\nErnest to carry his gun, but he complained of being overloaded with the\r\ngreat bowls. His indulgent mother took them from him, and we proceeded\r\nto the tent.\r\n\r\nFritz thought Ernest would not have relinquished the bowls, if he had\r\nknown what they contained, and called out to tell him they were\r\ncocoa-nuts.\r\n\r\n“Give them to me,” cried Ernest. “I will carry them, mamma, and the gun\r\ntoo.”\r\n\r\nHis mother declined giving them.\r\n\r\n“I can throw away these sticks,” said he, “and carry the gun in my\r\nhand.”\r\n\r\n“I would advise you not,” observed Fritz, “for the sticks are\r\nsugar-canes.”\r\n\r\n“Sugar-canes!” cried they all, surrounding Fritz, who had to give them\r\nthe history, and teach them the art of sucking the canes.\r\n\r\nMy wife, who had a proper respect for sugar in her housekeeping, was\r\nmuch pleased with this discovery, and the history of all our\r\nacquisitions, which I displayed to her. Nothing gave her so much\r\npleasure as our plates and dishes, which were actual necessaries. We\r\nwent to our kitchen, and were gratified to see preparations going on for\r\na good supper. My wife had planted a forked stick on each side the\r\nhearth; on these rested a long thin wand, on which all sorts of fish\r\nwere roasting, Francis being intrusted to turn the spit. On the other\r\nside was impaled a goose on another spit, and a row of oyster-shells\r\nformed the dripping-pan: besides this, the iron pot was on the fire,\r\nfrom which arose the savoury odour of a good soup. Behind the hearth\r\nstood one of the hogsheads, opened, and containing the finest Dutch\r\ncheeses, enclosed in cases of lead. All this was very tempting to hungry\r\ntravellers, and very unlike a supper on a desert island. I could not\r\nthink my family had been idle, when I saw such a result of their\r\nlabours; I was only sorry they had killed the goose, as I wished to be\r\neconomical with our poultry.\r\n\r\n“Have no uneasiness,” said my wife, “this is not from our poultry-yard,\r\nit is a wild goose, killed by Ernest.”\r\n\r\n“It is a sort of penguin, I believe,” said Ernest, “distinguished by\r\nthe name of _booby_, and so stupid, that I knocked it down with a stick.\r\nIt is web-footed, has a long narrow beak, a little curved downwards. I\r\nhave preserved the head and neck for you to examine; it exactly\r\nresembles the penguin of my book of natural history.”\r\n\r\nI pointed out to him the advantages of study, and was making more\r\ninquiries about the form and habits of the bird, when my wife requested\r\nme to defer my catechism of natural history.\r\n\r\n“Ernest has killed the bird,” added she; “I received it; we shall eat\r\nit. What more would you have? Let the poor child have the pleasure of\r\nexamining and tasting the cocoa-nuts.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” replied I, “Fritz must teach them how to open them; and we\r\nmust not forget the little monkey, who has lost his mother’s milk.”\r\n\r\n“I have tried him,” cried Jack, “and he will eat nothing.”\r\n\r\nI told them he had not yet learnt to eat, and we must feed him with\r\ncocoa-nut milk till we could get something better. Jack generously\r\noffered all his share, but Ernest and Francis were anxious to taste the\r\nmilk themselves.\r\n\r\n“But the monkey must live,” said Jack, petulantly.\r\n\r\n“And so must we all,” said mamma. “Supper is ready, and we will reserve\r\nthe cocoa-nuts for dessert.”\r\n\r\nWe sat down on the ground, and the supper was served on our gourd-rind\r\nservice, which answered the purpose admirably. My impatient boys had\r\nbroken the nuts, which they found excellent, and they made themselves\r\nspoons of the shell. Jack had taken care the monkey had his share; they\r\ndipped the corner of their handkerchiefs in the milk, and let him suck\r\nthem. They were going to break up some more nuts, after emptying them\r\nthrough the natural holes, but I stopped them, and called for a saw. I\r\ncarefully divided the nuts with this instrument, and soon provided us\r\neach with a neat basin for our soup, to the great comfort of my dear\r\nwife, who was gratified by seeing us able to eat like civilized beings.\r\nFritz begged now to enliven the repast by introducing his champaign. I\r\nconsented; requesting him, however, to taste it himself before he served\r\nit. What was his mortification to find it vinegar! But we consoled\r\nourselves by using it as sauce to our goose; a great improvement also to\r\nthe fish. We had now to hear the history of our supper. Jack and Francis\r\nhad caught the fish at the edge of the sea. My active wife had performed\r\nthe most laborious duty, in rolling the hogshead to the place and\r\nbreaking open the head.\r\n\r\nThe sun was going down as we finished supper, and, recollecting how\r\nrapidly night succeeded, we hastened to our tent, where we found our\r\nbeds much more comfortable, from the kind attention of the good mother,\r\nwho had collected a large addition of dried grass. After prayers, we all\r\nlay down; the monkey between Jack and Fritz, carefully covered with moss\r\nto keep him warm. The fowls went to their roost, as on the previous\r\nnight, and, after our fatigue, we were all soon in a profound sleep.\r\n\r\nWe had not slept long, when a great commotion among the dogs and fowls\r\nannounced the presence of an enemy. My wife, Fritz, and I, each seizing\r\na gun, rushed out.\r\n\r\nBy the light of the moon, we saw a terrible battle going on: our brave\r\ndogs were surrounded by a dozen jackals, three or four were extended\r\ndead, but our faithful animals were nearly overpowered by numbers when\r\nwe arrived. I was glad to find nothing worse than jackals; Fritz and I\r\nfired on them; two fell dead, and the others fled slowly, evidently\r\nwounded. Turk and Flora pursued and completed the business, and then,\r\nlike true dogs, devoured their fallen foes, regardless of the bonds of\r\nrelationship.\r\n\r\nAll being quiet again, we retired to our beds; Fritz obtaining leave to\r\ndrag the jackal he had killed towards the tent, to save it from the\r\ndogs, and to show to his brothers next morning. This he accomplished\r\nwith difficulty, for it was as big as a large dog.\r\n\r\nWe all slept peacefully the remainder of the night, till the crowing of\r\nthe cock awoke my wife and myself to a consultation on the business\r\nof the day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Well, my dear,” I began, “I feel rather alarmed at all the labours I\r\nsee before me. A voyage to the vessel is indispensable, if we wish to\r\nsave our cattle, and many other things that may be useful to us; on the\r\nother hand, I should like to have a more secure shelter for ourselves\r\nand our property than this tent.”\r\n\r\n“With patience, order, and perseverance, all may be done,” said my good\r\ncounsellor; “and whatever uneasiness your voyage may give me, I yield to\r\nthe importance and utility of it. Let it be done to-day; and have no\r\ncare for the morrow: sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof, as our\r\nblessed Lord has said.”\r\n\r\nIt was then agreed that the three youngest children should remain with\r\nmy wife; and Fritz, the strongest and most active, should accompany me.\r\n\r\nI then arose, and woke my children for the important duties of the day.\r\nFritz jumped up the first, and ran for his jackal, which had stiffened\r\nin the cold of the night. He placed it on its four legs, at the entrance\r\nof the tent, to surprise his brothers; but no sooner did the dogs see it\r\nerect, than they flew at it, and would have torn it to pieces, if he had\r\nnot soothed them and called them off. However, their barking effectually\r\nroused the boys, who rushed out to see the cause. Jack issued first with\r\nthe monkey on his shoulder; but no sooner did the little creature see\r\nthe jackal, than he sprang into the tent, and hid himself among the\r\nmoss, till only the tip of his nose was visible. All were astonished to\r\nsee this large yellow animal standing; Francis thought it was a wolf;\r\nJack said it was only a dead dog, and Ernest, in a pompous tone,\r\npronounced it to be a golden fox.\r\n\r\nFritz laughed at the learned professor, who knew the agouti immediately,\r\nand now called a jackal a golden fox!\r\n\r\n“I judged by the peculiar characteristics,” said Ernest, examining it\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\n“Oh! the characteristics!” said Fritz, ironically, “don’t you think it\r\nmay be a golden wolf?”\r\n\r\n“Pray don’t be so cross, brother,” said Ernest, with tears in his eyes,\r\n“perhaps you would not have known the name, if papa had not told you.”\r\n\r\nI reproved Fritz for his ridicule of his brother, and Ernest for so\r\neasily taking offence; and, to reconcile all, I told them that the\r\njackal partook of the nature of the wolf, the fox, and the dog. This\r\ndiscussion terminated, I summoned them to prayers, after which we\r\nthought of breakfast. We had nothing but biscuit, which was certainly\r\ndry and hard. Fritz begged for a little cheese with it; and Ernest, who\r\nwas never satisfied like other people, took a survey of the unopened\r\nhogshead. He soon returned, crying “If we only had a little butter with\r\nour biscuit, it would be so good, papa!”\r\n\r\nI allowed it would be good, but it was no use thinking of such a thing.\r\n\r\n“Let us open the other cask,” said he, displaying a piece of butter he\r\nhad extracted through a small crack on the side.\r\n\r\n“Your instinct for good things has been fortunate for us,” said I.\r\n“Come, boys, who wants bread and butter?”\r\n\r\nWe began to consider how we should come at the contents of the hogshead,\r\nwithout exposing the perishable matter to the heat of the sun. Finally,\r\nI pierced a hole in the lower part of the cask, large enough for us to\r\ndraw out the butter as we wanted it, by means of a little wooden shovel,\r\nwhich I soon made. We then sat down to breakfast with a cocoa-nut basin\r\nfilled with good salt Dutch butter. We toasted our biscuit, buttered it\r\nhot, and agreed that it was excellent. Our dogs were sleeping by us as\r\nwe breakfasted; and I remarked that they had bloody marks of the last\r\nnight’s fray, in some deep and dangerous wounds, especially about the\r\nneck; my wife instantly dressed the wounds with butter, well washed in\r\ncold water; and the poor animals seemed grateful for the ease it gave\r\nthem. Ernest judiciously remarked, that they ought to have spiked\r\ncollars, to defend them from any wild beasts they might encounter.\r\n\r\n“I will make them collars,” said Jack, who never hesitated at anything.\r\nI was glad to employ his inventive powers; and, ordering my children,\r\nnot to leave their mother, during our absence, but to pray to God to\r\nbless our undertaking, we began our preparations for the voyage.\r\n\r\nWhile Fritz made ready the boat, I erected a signal-post, with a piece\r\nof sailcloth for a flag, to float as long as all was going on well; but\r\nif we were wanted, they were to lower the flag, and fire a gun three\r\ntimes, when we would immediately return; for I had informed my dear wife\r\nit might be necessary for us to remain on board all night; and she\r\nconsented to the plan, on my promising to pass the night in our tubs,\r\ninstead of the vessel. We took nothing but our guns and ammunition;\r\nrelying on the ship’s provisions. Fritz would, however, take the monkey,\r\nthat he might give it some milk from the cow.\r\n\r\nWe took a tender leave of each other, and embarked. When we had rowed\r\ninto the middle of the bay, I perceived a strong current formed by the\r\nwater of the river which issued at a little distance, which I was glad\r\nto take advantage of, to spare our labour. It carried us three parts of\r\nour voyage, and we rowed the remainder; and entering the opening in the\r\nvessel, we secured our boat firmly, and went on board.\r\n\r\nThe first care of Fritz was to feed the animals, who were on deck, and\r\nwho all saluted us after their fashion, rejoiced to see their friends\r\nagain, as well as to have their wants supplied. We put the young monkey\r\nto a goat, which he sucked with extraordinary grimaces, to our infinite\r\namusement. We then took some refreshment ourselves, and Fritz, to my\r\ngreat surprise, proposed that we should begin by adding a sail to our\r\nboat. He said the current which helped us to the vessel, could not carry\r\nus back, but the wind which blew so strongly against us, and made our\r\nrowing so fatiguing, would be of great service, if we had a sail.\r\n\r\nI thanked my counsellor for his good advice, and we immediately set to\r\nthe task. I selected a strong pole for a mast, and a triangular sail,\r\nwhich was fixed to a yard. We made a hole in a plank, to receive the\r\nmast, secured the plank on our fourth tub, forming a deck, and then, by\r\naid of a block used to hoist and lower the sails, raised our mast.\r\nFinally, two ropes fastened by one end to the yard, and by the other to\r\neach extremity of the boat, enabled us to direct the sail at pleasure.\r\nFritz next ornamented the top of the mast with a little red streamer. He\r\nthen gave our boat the name of the _Deliverance_, and requested it might\r\nhenceforward be called the little vessel. To complete its equipment, I\r\ncontrived a rudder, so that I could direct the boat from either end.\r\n\r\nAfter signalling to our friends that we should not return that night, we\r\nspent the rest of the day in emptying the tubs of the stones we had used\r\nfor ballast, and replacing them with useful things. Powder and shot,\r\nnails and tools of all kinds, pieces of cloth; above all, we did not\r\nforget knives, forks, spoons, and kitchen utensils, including a\r\nroasting-jack. In the captain’s cabin we found some services of silver,\r\npewter plates and dishes, and a small chest filled with bottles of\r\nchoice wines. All these we took, as well as a chest of eatables,\r\nintended for the officers’ table, portable soup, Westphalian hams,\r\nBologna sausages, &c.; also some bags of maize, wheat, and other seeds,\r\nand some potatoes. We collected all the implements of husbandry we could\r\nspare room for, and, at the request of Fritz, some hammocks and\r\nblankets; two or three handsome guns, and an armful of sabres, swords,\r\nand hunting-knives. Lastly, I embarked a barrel of sulphur, all the cord\r\nand string I could lay my hands on, and a large roll of sailcloth. The\r\nsulphur was intended to produce matches with. Our tubs were loaded to\r\nthe edge; there was barely room left for us to sit, and it would have\r\nbeen dangerous to attempt our return if the sea had not been so calm.\r\n\r\nNight arrived, we exchanged signals, to announce security on sea and\r\nland, and, after prayers for the dear islanders, we sought our tubs, not\r\nthe most luxurious of dormitories, but safer than the ship. Fritz slept\r\nsoundly; but I could not close my eyes, thinking of the jackals. I was,\r\nhowever, thankful for the protection they had in the dogs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as day broke, I mounted on deck, to look through the telescope.\r\nI saw my wife looking towards us; and the flag, which denoted their\r\nsafety, floating in the breeze. Satisfied on this important point, we\r\nenjoyed our breakfast of biscuit, ham, and wine, and then turned our\r\nthoughts to the means of saving our cattle. Even if we could contrive a\r\nraft, we could never get all the animals to remain still on it. We might\r\nventure the huge sow in the water, but the rest of the animals we found\r\nwould not be able to swim to shore. At last Fritz suggested the swimming\r\napparatus. We passed two hours in constructing them. For the cow and ass\r\nit was necessary to have an empty cask on each side, well bound in\r\nstrong sailcloth, fastened by leather thongs over the back and under\r\neach animal. For the rest, we merely tied a piece of cork under their\r\nbodies; the sow only being unruly, and giving us much trouble. We then\r\nfastened a cord to the horns or neck of each animal, with a slip of wood\r\nat the end, for a convenient handle. Luckily, the waves had broken away\r\npart of the ship, and left the opening wide enough for the passage of\r\nour troop. We first launched the ass into the water, by a sudden push;\r\nhe swam away, after the first plunge, very gracefully. The cow, sheep,\r\nand goats, followed quietly after. The sow was furious, and soon broke\r\nloose from us all, but fortunately reached the shore long before\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nWe now embarked, fastening all the slips of wood to the stern of the\r\nboat, thus drawing our train after us; and the wind filling our sail,\r\ncarried us smoothly towards the shore. Fritz exulted in his plan, as we\r\ncertainly could never have rowed our boat, loaded as we were. I once\r\nmore took out my telescope, and was remarking that our party on shore\r\nseemed making ready for some excursion, when a loud cry from Fritz\r\nfilled me with terror. “We are lost! we are lost! see, what a monstrous\r\nfish!” Though pale with alarm, the bold boy had seized his gun, and,\r\nencouraged by my directions, he fired two balls into the head of the\r\nmonster, as it was preparing to dart on the sheep. It immediately made\r\nits escape, leaving a long red track to prove that it was\r\nseverely wounded.\r\n\r\nBeing freed from our enemy, I now resumed the rudder, and we lowered the\r\nsail and rowed to shore. The animals, as soon as the water became low\r\nenough, walked out at their own discretion, after we had relieved them\r\nfrom their swimming girdles. We then secured our boat as before, and\r\nlanded ourselves, anxiously looking round for our friends.\r\n\r\nWe had not long to wait, they came joyfully to greet us; and, after our\r\nfirst burst of pleasure, we sat down to tell our adventures in a regular\r\nform. My wife was overjoyed to see herself surrounded by these valuable\r\nanimals; and especially pleased that her son Fritz had suggested so\r\nmany useful plans. We next proceeded to disembark all our treasures. I\r\nnoticed that Jack wore a belt of yellow skin, in which were placed a\r\npair of pistols, and inquired where he had got his brigand costume.\r\n\r\n“I manufactured it myself,” said he; “and this is not all. Look at the\r\ndogs!”\r\n\r\nThe dogs wore each a collar of the same skin as his belt, bristling with\r\nlong nails, the points outwards—a formidable defence.\r\n\r\n“It is my own invention,” said he; “only mamma helped me in the sewing.”\r\n\r\n“But where did you get the leather, the needle and thread?” inquired I.\r\n\r\n“Fritz’s jackal supplied the skin,” said my wife, “and my wonderful bag\r\nthe rest. There is still more to come from it, only say what you want.”\r\n\r\nFritz evidently felt a little vexation at his brother’s unceremonious\r\nappropriation of the skin of the jackal, which displayed itself in the\r\ntone in which he exclaimed, holding his nose, “Keep at a distance, Mr.\r\nSkinner, you carry an intolerable smell about with you.”\r\n\r\nI gave him a gentle hint of his duty in the position of eldest son, and\r\nhe soon recovered his good humour. However, as the body as well as the\r\nskin of the jackal was becoming offensive, they united in dragging it\r\ndown to the sea, while Jack placed his belt in the sun to dry.\r\n\r\nAs I saw no preparation for supper, I told Fritz to bring the ham; and,\r\nto the astonishment and joy of all, he returned with a fine Westphalian\r\nham, which we had cut into in the morning.\r\n\r\n“I will tell you,” said my wife, “why we have no supper prepared; but\r\nfirst, I will make you an omelet;” and she produced from a basket a\r\ndozen turtle’s eggs.\r\n\r\n“You see,” said Ernest, “they have all the characteristics of those\r\nRobinson Crusoe had in his island. They are white balls, the skin of\r\nwhich resembles moistened parchment.”\r\n\r\nMy wife promised to relate the history of the discovery after supper,\r\nand set about preparing her ham and omelet, while Fritz and I proceeded\r\nin unloading our cargo, assisted by the useful ass.\r\n\r\nSupper was now ready. A tablecloth was laid over the butter-cask, and\r\nspread with the plates and spoons from the ship. The ham was in the\r\nmiddle, and the omelet and cheese at each end; and we made a good meal,\r\nsurrounded by our subjects,—the dogs, the fowls, the pigeons, the\r\nsheep, and the goats, waiting for our notice. The geese and ducks were\r\nmore independent, remaining in their marsh, where they lived in plenty\r\non the small crabs which abounded there.\r\n\r\nAfter supper, I sent Fritz for a bottle of the captain’s Canary wine,\r\nand then requested my wife to give us her recital.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I will spare you the history of the first day,” said my good Elizabeth,\r\n“spent in anxiety about you, and attending to the signals; but this\r\nmorning, being satisfied that all was going right, I sought, before the\r\nboys got up, a shady place to rest in, but in vain; I believe this\r\nbarren shore has not a single tree on it. Then I began to consider on\r\nthe necessity of searching for a more comfortable spot for our\r\nresidence; and determined, after a slight repast, to set out with my\r\nchildren across the river, on a journey of discovery. The day before,\r\nJack had busied himself in skinning the jackal with his knife, sharpened\r\non the rock; Ernest declining to assist him in his dirty work, for which\r\nI reproved him, sorry that any fastidiousness should deter him from a\r\nlabour of benefit to society.\r\n\r\n“Jack proceeded to clean the skin as well as he was able; then procured\r\nfrom the nail-chest some long flat-headed nails, and inserted them\r\nclosely through the long pieces of skin he had cut for collars; he then\r\ncut some sailcloth, and made a double lining over the heads of the\r\nnails; and finished by giving me the delicate office of sewing them\r\ntogether, which I could not but comply with.\r\n\r\n“His belt he first stretched on a plank, nailing it down, and exposing\r\nit to the sun, lest it should shrink in drying.\r\n\r\n“Now for our journey: we took our game-bags and some hunting-knives. The\r\nboys carried provisions, and I had a large flask of water. I took a\r\nsmall hatchet, and gave Ernest a carbine, which might be loaded with\r\nball; keeping his light gun for myself. I carefully secured the opening\r\nof the tent with the hooks. Turk went before, evidently considering\r\nhimself our guide; and we crossed the river with some difficulty.\r\n\r\n“As we proceeded, I could not help feeling thankful that you had so\r\nearly taught the boys to use fire-arms properly, as the defence of my\r\nyoungest boy and myself now depended on the two boys of ten and twelve\r\nyears of age.\r\n\r\n“When we attained the hill you described to us, I was charmed with the\r\nsmiling prospect, and, for the first time since our shipwreck, ventured\r\nto hope for better things. I had remarked a beautiful wood, to which I\r\ndetermined to make our way, for a little shade, and a most painful\r\nprogress it was, through grass that was higher than the children’s\r\nheads. As we were struggling through it, we heard a strange rustling\r\nsound among the grass, and at the same moment a bird of prodigious size\r\nrose, and flew away, before the poor boys could get their guns ready.\r\nThey were much mortified, and I recommended them always to have their\r\nguns in readiness, for the birds would not be likely to wait till they\r\nloaded them. Francis thought the bird was so large, it must be an eagle;\r\nbut Ernest ridiculed the idea, and added that he thought it must be of\r\nthe bustard tribe. We went forward to the spot from which it had arisen,\r\nwhen suddenly another bird of the same kind, though still larger, sprung\r\nup, close to our feet, and was soon soaring above our heads. I could not\r\nhelp laughing to see the look of astonishment and confusion with which\r\nthe boys looked upwards after it. At last Jack took off his hat, and,\r\nmaking a low bow, said, ‘Pray, Mr. Bird, be kind enough to pay us\r\nanother visit, you will find us very good children!’ We found the large\r\nnest they had left; it was rudely formed of dry grass, and empty, but\r\nsome fragments of egg-shells were scattered near, as if the young had\r\nbeen recently hatched; we therefore concluded that they had escaped\r\namong the grass.\r\n\r\n“Doctor Ernest immediately began a lecture. ‘You observe, Francis, these\r\nbirds could not be eagles, which do not form their nests on the ground.\r\nNeither do their young run as soon as they are hatched. These must be of\r\nthe _gallinaceous_ tribe, an order of birds such as quails, partridges,\r\nturkeys, &c.; and, from the sort of feathered moustache which I observed\r\nat the corner of the beak, I should pronounce that these were bustards.’\r\n\r\n“But we had now reached the little wood, and our learned friend had\r\nsufficient employment in scrutinizing, and endeavouring to classify, the\r\nimmense number of beautiful, unknown birds, which sung and fluttered\r\nabout us, apparently regardless of our intrusion.\r\n\r\n“We found that what we thought a wood was merely a group of a dozen\r\ntrees, of a height far beyond any I had ever seen; and apparently\r\nbelonging rather to the air than the earth; the trunks springing from\r\nroots which formed a series of supporting arches. Jack climbed one of\r\nthe arches, and measured the trunk of the tree with a piece of\r\npackthread. He found it to be thirty-four feet. I made thirty-two steps\r\nround the roots. Between the roots and the lowest branches, it seemed\r\nabout forty or fifty feet. The branches are thick and strong, and the\r\nleaves are of a moderate size, and resemble our walnut-tree. A thick,\r\nshort, smooth turf clothed the ground beneath and around the detached\r\nroots of the trees, and everything combined to render this one of the\r\nmost delicious spots the mind could conceive.\r\n\r\n“Here we rested, and made our noon-day repast; a clear rivulet ran near\r\nus, and offered its agreeable waters for our refreshment. Our dogs soon\r\njoined us; but I was astonished to find they did not crave for food, but\r\nlaid down to sleep at our feet. For myself, so safe and happy did I\r\nfeel, that I could not but think that if we could contrive a dwelling on\r\nthe branches of one of these trees, we should be in perfect peace and\r\nsafety. We set out on our return, taking the road by the sea-shore, in\r\ncase the waves had cast up anything from the wreck of the vessel. We\r\nfound a quantity of timber, chests, and casks; but all too heavy to\r\nbring. We succeeded in dragging them, as well as we could, out of the\r\nreach of the tide; our dogs, in the mean time, fishing for crabs, with\r\nwhich they regaled themselves, much to their own satisfaction and to\r\nmine, as I now saw they would be able to provide their own food. As we\r\nrested from our rough labour, I saw Flora scratching in the sand, and\r\nswallowing something with great relish. Ernest watched, and then said,\r\nvery quietly, ‘They are turtles’ eggs.’ We drove away the dog, and\r\ncollected about two dozen, leaving her the rest as a reward for her\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\n“While we were carefully depositing our spoil in the game-bags, we were\r\nastonished at the sight of a sail. Ernest was certain it was papa and\r\nFritz, and though Francis was in dread that it should be the savages who\r\nvisited Robinson Crusoe’s island, coming to eat us up, we were soon\r\nenabled to calm his fears. We crossed the river by leaping from stone to\r\nstone, and, hastening to the landing-place, arrived to greet you on\r\nyour happy return.”\r\n\r\n“And I understand, my dear,” said I, “that you have discovered a tree\r\nsixty feet high, where you wish we should perch like fowls. But how are\r\nwe to get up?”\r\n\r\n“Oh! you must remember,” answered she, “the large lime-tree near our\r\nnative town, in which was a ball-room. We used to ascend to it by a\r\nwooden staircase. Could you not contrive something of the sort in one of\r\nthese gigantic trees, where we might sleep in peace, fearing neither\r\njackals nor any other terrible nocturnal enemy.”\r\n\r\nI promised to consider this plan, hoping at least that we might make a\r\ncommodious and shady dwelling among the roots. To-morrow we were to\r\nexamine it. We then performed our evening devotions, and retired\r\nto rest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Now, my dear Elizabeth,” said I, waking early next morning, “let us\r\ntalk a little on this grand project of changing our residence; to which\r\nthere are many objections. First, it seems wise to remain on the spot\r\nwhere Providence has cast us, where we can have at once means of support\r\ndrawn from the ship, and security from all attacks, protected by the\r\nrock, the river, and the sea on all sides.”\r\n\r\nMy wife distrusted the river, which could not protect us from the\r\njackals, and complained of the intolerable heat of this sandy desert, of\r\nher distaste for such food as oysters and wild geese; and, lastly, of\r\nher agony of mind, when we ventured to the wreck; willingly renouncing\r\nall its treasures, and begging we might rest content with the blessings\r\nwe already had.\r\n\r\n“There is some truth in your objections,” said I, “and perhaps we may\r\nerect a dwelling under the roots of your favourite tree; but among these\r\nrocks we must have a storehouse for our goods, and a retreat in case of\r\ninvasion. I hope, by blowing off some pieces of the rock with powder, to\r\nbe able to fortify the part next the river, leaving a secret passage\r\nknown only to ourselves. This would make it impregnable. But before we\r\nproceed, we must have a bridge to convey our baggage across the river.\r\n\r\n“A bridge,” said she, in a tone of vexation; “then when shall we get\r\nfrom here? Why cannot we ford it as usual? The cow and ass could carry\r\nour stores.”\r\n\r\nI explained to her how necessary it was for our ammunition and provision\r\nto be conveyed over without risk of wetting, and begged her to\r\nmanufacture some bags and baskets, and leave the bridge to me and my\r\nboys. If we succeeded, it would always be useful; as for fear of danger\r\nfrom lightning or accident, I intended to make a powder-magazine among\r\nthe rocks.\r\n\r\nThe important question was now decided. I called up my sons, and\r\ncommunicated our plans to them. They were greatly delighted, though\r\nsomewhat alarmed, at the formidable project of the bridge; besides, the\r\ndelay was vexatious; they were all anxious for a removal into the _Land\r\nof Promise_, as they chose to call it.\r\n\r\nWe read prayers, and then thought of breakfast. The monkey sucked one of\r\nthe goats, as if it had been its mother. My wife milked the cow, and\r\ngave us boiled milk with biscuit for our breakfast; part of which she\r\nput in a flask, for us to take on our expedition. We then prepared our\r\nboat for a voyage to the vessel, to procure planks and timber for our\r\nbridge. I took both Ernest and Fritz, as I foresaw our cargo would be\r\nweighty, and require all our hands to bring it to shore.\r\n\r\nWe rowed vigorously till we got into the current, which soon carried us\r\nbeyond the bay. We had scarcely reached a little isle at the entrance,\r\nwhen we saw a vast number of gulls and other sea-birds, fluttering with\r\ndiscordant cries over it. I hoisted the sail, and we approached rapidly;\r\nand, when near enough, we stepped on shore, and saw that the birds were\r\nfeasting so eagerly on the remains of a huge fish, that they did not\r\neven notice our approach. We might have killed numbers, even with our\r\nsticks. This fish was the shark which Fritz had so skilfully shot\r\nthrough the head the night before. He found the marks of his three\r\nballs. Ernest drew his ramrod from his gun, and struck so vigorously\r\nright and left among the birds, that he killed some, and put the rest to\r\nflight. We then hastily cut off some pieces of the skin of the monster,\r\nwhich I thought might be useful, and placed them in our boat. But this\r\nwas not the only advantage we gained by landing. I perceived an immense\r\nquantity of wrecked timber lying on the shore of the island, which\r\nwould spare us our voyage to the ship. We selected such planks as were\r\nfit for our purpose; then, by the aid of our _jack-screw_ and some\r\nlevers we had brought with us, we extricated the planks from the sand,\r\nand floated them; and, binding the spars and yards together with cords,\r\nwith the planks above them, like a raft, we tied them to the stern of\r\nour boat, and hoisted our sail.\r\n\r\nFritz, as we sailed, was drying the shark’s skin, which I hoped to\r\nconvert into files. And Ernest, in his usual reflective manner, observed\r\nto me, “What a beautiful arrangement of Providence it is, that the mouth\r\nof the shark should be placed in such a position that he is compelled to\r\nturn on his back to seize his prey, thus giving it a chance of escape;\r\nelse, with his excessive voracity, he might depopulate the ocean.”\r\n\r\nAt last, we reached our landing-place, and, securing our boat, and\r\ncalling out loudly, we soon saw our friends running from the river; each\r\ncarried a handkerchief filled with some new acquisition, and Francis had\r\nover his shoulder a small fishing-net. Jack reached us first, and threw\r\ndown before us from his handkerchief some fine crawfish. They had each\r\nas many, forming a provision for many days.\r\n\r\nFrancis claimed the merit of the discovery. Jack related, that Francis\r\nand he took a walk to find a good place for the bridge.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, Mr. Architect,” said I; “then you must superintend the\r\nworkmen. Have you fixed on your place?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes!” cried he; “only listen. When we got to the river, Francis,\r\nwho was looking about, called out, ‘Jack! Jack! Fritz’s jackal is\r\ncovered with crabs! Come!—come!’ I ran to tell mamma, who brought a net\r\nthat came from the ship, and we caught these in a few minutes, and could\r\nhave got many more, if you had not come.”\r\n\r\nI commanded them to put the smaller ones back into the river, reserving\r\nonly as many as we could eat. I was truly thankful to discover another\r\nmeans of support.\r\n\r\nWe now landed our timber. I had looked at Jack’s site for the bridge,\r\nand thought my little architect very happy in his selection; but it was\r\nat a great distance from the timber. I recollected the simplicity of the\r\nharness the Laplanders used for their reindeer. I tied cords to the\r\nhorns of the cow—as the strength of this animal is in the head—and\r\nthen fastened the other ends round the piece of timber we wanted moving.\r\nI placed a halter round the neck of the ass, and attached the cords to\r\nthis. We were thus enabled, by degrees, to remove all our wood to the\r\nchosen spot, where the sides of the river were steep, and appeared of\r\nequal height.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to know the breadth of the river, to select the proper\r\nplanks; and Ernest proposed to procure a ball of packthread from his\r\nmother, to tie a stone to one end of the string, and throw it across the\r\nriver, and to measure it after drawing it back. This expedient succeeded\r\nadmirably. We found the breadth to be eighteen feet; but, as I proposed\r\nto give the bridge strength by having three feet, at least, resting on\r\neach shore, we chose some planks of twenty-four feet in length. How we\r\nwere to get these across the river was another question, which we\r\nprepared to discuss during dinner, to which my wife now summoned us.\r\n\r\nOur dinner consisted of a dish of crawfish, and some very good\r\nrice-milk. But, before we began, we admired her work. She had made a\r\npair of bags for the ass, sewed with packthread; but having no large\r\nneedles, she had been obliged to pierce holes with a nail, a tedious and\r\npainful process. Well satisfied with her success, we turned to our\r\nrepast, talking of our bridge, which the boys, by anticipation, named\r\nthe _Nonpareil_. We then went to work.\r\n\r\nThere happened to be an old trunk of a tree standing on the shore. To\r\nthis I tied my main beam by a strong cord, loose enough to turn round\r\nthe trunk. Another cord was attached to the opposite end of the beam,\r\nlong enough to cross the river twice. I took the end of my rope over the\r\nstream, where we had previously fixed the block, used in our boat, to a\r\ntree, by the hook which usually suspended it. I passed my rope, and\r\nreturned with the end to our own side. I then harnessed my cow and ass\r\nto the end of my rope, and drove them forcibly from the shore. The beam\r\nturned slowly round the trunk, then advanced, and was finally lodged\r\nover the river, amidst the shouts of the boys; its own weight keeping it\r\nfirm. Fritz and Jack leaped on it immediately to run across, to my\r\ngreat fear.\r\n\r\nWe succeeded in placing four strong beams in the same way; and, by the\r\naid of my sons, I arranged them at a convenient distance from each\r\nother, that we might have a broad and good bridge. We then laid down\r\nplanks close together across the beams; but not fixed, as in time of\r\ndanger it might be necessary rapidly to remove the bridge. My wife and I\r\nwere as much excited as the children, and ran across with delight. Our\r\nbridge was at least ten feet broad.\r\n\r\nThoroughly fatigued with our day of labour, we returned home, supped,\r\nand offered thanks to God, and went to rest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, after prayers, I assembled my family. We took a solemn\r\nleave of our first place of refuge. I cautioned my sons to be prudent,\r\nand on their guard; and especially to remain together during our\r\njourney. We then prepared for departure. We assembled the cattle: the\r\nbags were fixed across the backs of the cow and the ass, and loaded with\r\nall our heavy baggage; our cooking utensils; and provisions, consisting\r\nof biscuits, butter, cheese, and portable soup; our hammocks and\r\nblankets; the captain’s service of plate, were all carefully packed in\r\nthe bags, equally poised on each side the animals.\r\n\r\nAll was ready, when my wife came in haste with her inexhaustible bag,\r\nrequesting a place for it. Neither would she consent to leave the\r\npoultry, as food for the jackals; above all, Francis must have a place;\r\nhe could not possibly walk all the way. I was amused with the exactions\r\nof the sex; but consented to all, and made a good place for Francis\r\nbetween the bags, on the back of the ass.\r\n\r\nThe elder boys returned in despair,—they could not succeed in catching\r\nthe fowls; but the experienced mother laughed at them, and said she\r\nwould soon capture them.\r\n\r\n“If you do,” said my pert little Jack, “I will be contented to be\r\nroasted in the place of the first chicken taken.”\r\n\r\n“Then, my poor Jack,” said his mother, “you will soon be on the spit.\r\nRemember, that intellect has always more power than mere bodily\r\nexertion. Look here!” She scattered a few handfuls of grain before the\r\ntent, calling the fowls; they soon all assembled, including the pigeons;\r\nthen throwing more down inside the tent, they followed her. It was now\r\nonly necessary to close the entrance; and they were all soon taken, tied\r\nby the wings and feet, and, being placed in baskets covered with nets,\r\nwere added to the rest of our luggage on the backs of the animals.\r\n\r\nFinally, we conveyed inside the tent all we could not carry away,\r\nclosing the entrance, and barricading it with chests and casks, thus\r\nconfiding all our possessions to the care of God. We set out on our\r\npilgrimage, each carrying a game-bag and a gun. My wife and her eldest\r\nson led the way, followed by the heavily-laden cow and ass; the third\r\ndivision consisted of the goats, driven by Jack, the little monkey\r\nseated on the back of its nurse, and grimacing, to our great amusement;\r\nnext came Ernest, with the sheep; and I followed, superintending the\r\nwhole. Our gallant dogs acted as _aides-de-camp_, and were continually\r\npassing from the front to the rear rank.\r\n\r\nOur march was slow, but orderly, and quite patriarchal. “We are now\r\ntravelling across the deserts, as our first fathers did,” said I, “and\r\nas the Arabs, Tartars, and other nomade nations do to this day, followed\r\nby their flocks and herds. But these people generally have strong camels\r\nto bear their burdens, instead of a poor ass and cow. I hope this may be\r\nthe last of our pilgrimages.” My wife also hoped that, once under the\r\nshade of her marvellous trees, we should have no temptation to\r\ntravel further.\r\n\r\nWe now crossed our new bridge, and here the party was happily augmented\r\nby a new arrival. The sow had proved very mutinous at setting out, and\r\nwe had been compelled to leave her; she now voluntarily joined us,\r\nseeing we were actually departing; but continued to grunt loudly her\r\ndisapprobation of our proceedings. After we had crossed the river, we\r\nhad another embarrassment. The rich grass tempted our animals to stray\r\noff to feed, and, but for our dogs, we should never have been able to\r\nmuster them again. But, for fear of further accident, I commanded my\r\nadvanced guard to take the road by the coast, which offered no\r\ntemptation to our troops.\r\n\r\nWe had scarcely left the high grass when our dogs rushed back into it,\r\nbarking furiously, and howling as if in combat; Fritz immediately\r\nprepared for action, Ernest drew near his mother, Jack rushed forward\r\nwith his gun over his shoulder, and I cautiously advanced, commanding\r\nthem to be discreet and cool. But Jack, with his usual impetuosity,\r\nleaped among the high grass to the dogs; and immediately returned,\r\nclapping his hands, and crying out, “Be quick, papa! a huge porcupine,\r\nwith quills as long as my arm!”\r\n\r\nWhen I got up, I really found a porcupine, whom the dogs were warmly\r\nattacking. It made a frightful noise, erecting its quills so boldly,\r\nthat the wounded animals howled with pain after every attempt to seize\r\nit. As we were looking at them Jack drew a pistol from his belt, and\r\ndischarged it directly into the head of the porcupine, which fell dead.\r\nJack was very proud of his feat, and Fritz, not a little jealous,\r\nsuggested that such a little boy should not be trusted with pistols, as\r\nhe might have shot one of the dogs, or even one of us. I forbade any\r\nenvy or jealousy among the brothers, and declared that all did well who\r\nacted for the public good. Mamma was now summoned to see the curious\r\nanimal her son’s valour had destroyed. Her first thought was to dress\r\nthe wounds made by the quills which had stuck in the noses of the dogs\r\nduring their attack. In the mean time, I corrected my son’s notions on\r\nthe power of this animal to lance its darts when in danger. This is a\r\npopular error; nature has given it a sufficient protection in its\r\ndefensive and offensive armour.\r\n\r\nAs Jack earnestly desired to carry his booty with him, I carefully\r\nimbedded the body in soft grass, to preserve the quills; then packed it\r\nin strong cloth, and placed it on the ass behind Francis.\r\n\r\nAt last, we arrived at the end of our journey,—and, certainly, the size\r\nof the trees surpassed anything I could have imagined. Jack was certain\r\nthey were gigantic walnut-trees; for my own part, I believed them to be\r\na species of fig-tree—probably the Antilles fig. But all thanks were\r\ngiven to the kind mother who had sought out such a pleasant home for us;\r\nat all events, we could find a convenient shelter among the roots. And,\r\nif we should ever succeed in perching on the branches, I told her we\r\nshould be safe from all wild beasts. I would defy even the bears of our\r\nnative mountains to climb these immense trunks, totally destitute\r\nof branches.\r\n\r\nWe released our animals from their loads, tying their fore legs\r\ntogether, that they might not stray; except the sow, who, as usual, did\r\nher own way. The fowls and pigeons we released, and left to their own\r\ndiscretion. We then sat down on the grass, to consider where we should\r\nestablish ourselves. I wished to mount the tree that very night.\r\nSuddenly we heard, to our no slight alarm, the report of a gun. But the\r\nnext moment the voice of Fritz re-assured us. He had stolen out\r\nunnoticed, and shot a beautiful tiger-cat, which he displayed in\r\ngreat triumph.\r\n\r\n“Well done, noble hunter!” said I; “you deserve the thanks of the fowls\r\nand pigeons; they would most probably have all fallen a sacrifice\r\nto-night, if you had not slain their deadly foe. Pray wage war with all\r\nhis kind, or we shall not have a chicken left for the pot.”\r\n\r\nErnest then examined the animal with his customary attention, and\r\ndeclared that the proper name was the _margay_, a fact Fritz did not\r\ndispute, only requesting that Jack might not meddle with the skin, as he\r\nwished to preserve it for a belt. I recommended them to skin it\r\nimmediately, and give the flesh to the dogs. Jack, at the same time,\r\ndetermined to skin his porcupine, to make dog-collars. Part of its\r\nflesh went into the soup-kettle, and the rest was salted for the next\r\nday. We then sought for some flat stones in the bed of the charming\r\nlittle river that ran at a little distance from us, and set about\r\nconstructing a cooking-place. Francis collected dry wood for the fire;\r\nand, while my wife was occupied in preparing our supper, I amused myself\r\nby making some packing-needles for her rude work from the quills of the\r\nporcupine. I held a large nail in the fire till it was red-hot, then,\r\nholding the head in wet linen, I pierced the quills, and made several\r\nneedles, of various sizes, to the great contentment of our indefatigable\r\nworkwoman.\r\n\r\nStill occupied with the idea of our castle in the air, I thought of\r\nmaking a ladder of ropes; but this would be useless, if we did not\r\nsucceed in getting a cord over the lower branches, to draw it up.\r\nNeither my sons nor myself could throw a stone, to which I had fastened\r\na cord, over these branches, which were thirty feet above us. It was\r\nnecessary to think of some other expedient. In the mean time, dinner was\r\nready. The porcupine made excellent soup, and the flesh was well-tasted,\r\nthough rather hard. My wife could not make up her mind to taste it, but\r\ncontented herself with a slice of ham and some cheese.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, as I found we could not ascend at present, I suspended our\r\nhammocks under the arched roots of our tree, and, covering the whole\r\nwith sailcloth, we had a shelter from the dew and the insects.\r\n\r\nWhile my wife was employed making harness for the cow and ass, I went\r\nwith my sons to the shore, to look for wood fit for our use next day. We\r\nsaw a great quantity of wreck, but none fit for our purpose, till Ernest\r\nmet with a heap of bamboo canes, half buried in sand and mud. These were\r\nexactly what I wanted. I drew them out of the sand, stripped them of\r\ntheir leaves, cut them in pieces of about four or five feet long, and my\r\nsons each made up a bundle to carry home. I then set out to seek some\r\nslender stalks to make arrows, which I should need in my project.\r\n\r\nWe went towards a thick grove, which appeared likely to contain\r\nsomething for my purpose. We were very cautious, for fear of reptiles or\r\nother dangerous animals, allowing Flora to precede us. When we got near,\r\nshe darted furiously among the bushes, and out flew a troop of beautiful\r\nflamingoes, and soared into the air. Fritz, always ready, fired at them.\r\nTwo fell; one quite dead, the other, slightly wounded in the wing, made\r\nuse of its long legs so well that it would have escaped, if Flora had\r\nnot seized it and held it till I came up to take possession. The joy of\r\nFritz was extreme, to have this beautiful creature alive. He thought at\r\nonce of curing its wound, and domesticating it with our own poultry.\r\n\r\n“What splendid plumage!” said Ernest; “and you see he is web-footed,\r\nlike the goose, and has long legs like the stork; thus he can run as\r\nfast on land as he can swim in the water,”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said I, “and fly as quickly in the air. These birds are\r\nremarkable for the power and strength of their wings. Few birds have so\r\nmany advantages.”\r\n\r\nMy boys occupied themselves in binding their captive and dressing his\r\nwound; while I sought some of the canes which had done flowering, to cut\r\noff the hard ends, to point my arrows. These are used by the savages of\r\nthe Antilles. I then selected the highest canes I could meet with, to\r\nassist me in measuring, by a geometrical process, the height of the\r\ntree. Ernest took the canes, I had the wounded flamingo, and Fritz\r\ncarried his own game. Very loud were the cries of joy and astonishment\r\nat our approach. The boys all hoped the flamingo might be tamed, of\r\nwhich I felt no doubt; but my wife was uneasy, lest it should require\r\nmore food than she could spare. However, I assured her, our new guest\r\nwould need no attention, as he would provide for himself at the\r\nriver-side, feeding on small fishes, worms, and insects. His wounds I\r\ndressed, and found they would soon be healed; I then tied him to a\r\nstake, near the river, by a cord long enough to allow him to fish at his\r\npleasure, and, in fact, in a few days, he learned to know us, and was\r\nquite domesticated. Meantime, my boys had been trying to measure the\r\ntree with the long canes I had brought, and came laughing to report to\r\nme, that I ought to have got them ten times as long to reach even the\r\nlowest branches. “There is a simpler mode than that,” said I, “which\r\ngeometry teaches us, and by which the highest mountains can be\r\nmeasured.”\r\n\r\nI then showed the method of measuring heights by triangles and imaginary\r\nlines, using canes of different lengths and cords instead of\r\nmathematical instruments. My result was thirty feet to the lowest\r\nbranches. This experiment filled the boys with wonder and desire to\r\nbecome acquainted with this useful, exact science, which, happily, I was\r\nable to teach them fully.\r\n\r\nI now ordered Fritz to measure our strong cord, and the little ones to\r\ncollect all the small string, and wind it. I then took a strong bamboo\r\nand made a bow of it, and some arrows of the slender canes, filling them\r\nwith wet sand to give them weight, and feathering them from the dead\r\nflamingo. As soon as my work was completed, the boys crowded round me,\r\nall begging to try the bow and arrows. I begged them to be patient, and\r\nasked my wife to supply me with a ball of thick strong thread. The\r\nenchanted bag did not fail us; the very ball I wanted appeared at her\r\nsummons. This, my little ones declared, must be magic; but I explained\r\nto them, that prudence, foresight, and presence of mind in danger, such\r\nas their good mother had displayed, produced more miracles than magic.\r\n\r\nI then tied the end of the ball of thread to one of my arrows, fixed it\r\nin my bow, and sent it directly over one of the thickest of the lower\r\nbranches of the tree, and, falling to the ground, it drew the thread\r\nafter it. Charmed with this result, I hastened to complete my ladder.\r\nFritz had measured our ropes, and found two of forty feet each,—exactly\r\nwhat I wanted. These I stretched on the ground at about one foot\r\ndistance from each other; Fritz cut pieces of cane two feet long, which\r\nErnest passed to me. I placed these in knots which I had made in the\r\ncords, at about a foot distance from each other, and Jack fastened each\r\nend with a long nail, to prevent it slipping. In a very short time our\r\nladder was completed; and, tying it to the end of the cord which went\r\nover the branch, we drew it up without difficulty. All the boys were\r\nanxious to ascend; but I chose Jack, as the lightest and most active.\r\nAccordingly, he ascended, while his brothers and myself held the ladder\r\nfirm by the end of the cord. Fritz followed him, conveying a bag with\r\nnails and hammer. They were soon perched on the branches, huzzaing to\r\nus. Fritz secured the ladder so firmly to the branch, that I had no\r\nhesitation in ascending myself. I carried with me a large pulley fixed\r\nto the end of a rope, which I attached to a branch above us, to enable\r\nus to raise the planks necessary to form the groundwork of our\r\nhabitation. I smoothed the branches a little by aid of my axe, sending\r\nthe boys down to be out of my way. After completing my day’s work, I\r\ndescended by the light of the moon, and was alarmed to find that Fritz\r\nand Jack were not below; and still more so, when I heard their clear,\r\nsweet voices, at the summit of the tree, singing the evening hymn, as if\r\nto sanctify our future abode. They had climbed the tree, instead of\r\ndescending, and, filled with wonder and reverence at the sublime view\r\nbelow them, had burst out into the hymn of thanksgiving to God.\r\n\r\nI could not scold my dear boys, when they descended, but directed them\r\nto assemble the animals, and to collect wood, to keep up fires during\r\nthe night, in order to drive away any wild beasts that might be near.\r\n\r\nMy wife then displayed her work,—complete harness for our two beasts\r\nof burden, and, in return, I promised her we would establish ourselves\r\nnext day in the tree. Supper was now ready, one piece of the porcupine\r\nwas roasted by the fire, smelling deliciously; another piece formed a\r\nrich soup; a cloth was spread on the turf; the ham, cheese, butter, and\r\nbiscuits, were placed upon it.\r\n\r\nMy wife first assembled the fowls, by throwing some grain to them, to\r\naccustom them to the place. We soon saw the pigeons fly to roost on the\r\nhigher branches of the trees, while the fowls perched on the ladder; the\r\nbeasts we tied to the roots, close to us. Now, that our cares were over,\r\nwe sat down to a merry and excellent repast by moonlight. Then, after\r\nthe prayers of the evening, I kindled our watch-fires, and we all lay\r\ndown to rest in our hammocks. The boys were rather discontented, and\r\ncomplained of their cramped position, longing for the freedom of their\r\nbeds of moss; but I instructed them to lie, as the sailors do,\r\ndiagonally, and swinging the hammock, and told them that brave Swiss\r\nboys might sleep as the sailors of all nations were compelled to sleep.\r\nAfter some stifled sighs and groans, all sank to rest except myself,\r\nkept awake by anxiety for the safety of the rest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy anxiety kept me awake till near morning, when, after a short sleep, I\r\nrose, and we were soon all at work. My wife, after milking the cow and\r\ngoats, harnessed the cow and ass, and set out to search for drift-wood\r\nfor our use. In the mean time, I mounted the ladder with Fritz, and we\r\nset to work stoutly, with axe and saw, to rid ourselves of all useless\r\nbranches. Some, about six feet above our foundation, I left, to suspend\r\nour hammocks from, and others, a little higher, to support the roof,\r\nwhich, at present, was to be merely sailcloth. My wife succeeded in\r\ncollecting us some boards and planks, which, with her assistance, and\r\nthe aid of the pulley, we hoisted up. We then arranged them on the level\r\nbranches close to each other, in such a manner as to form a smooth and\r\nsolid floor. I made a sort of parapet round, to prevent accidents. By\r\ndegrees, our dwelling began to assume a distinct form; the sailcloth was\r\nraised over the high branches, forming a roof; and, being brought down\r\non each side, was nailed to the parapet. The immense trunk protected the\r\nback of our apartment, and the front was open to admit the breeze from\r\nthe sea, which was visible from this elevation. We hoisted our hammocks\r\nand blankets by the pulley, and suspended them; my son and I then\r\ndescended, and, as our day was not yet exhausted, we set about\r\nconstructing a rude table and some benches, from the remainder of our\r\nwood, which we placed beneath the roots of the tree, henceforward to be\r\nour dining-room. The little boys collected the chips and pieces of wood\r\nfor fire-wood; while their mamma prepared supper, which we needed much\r\nafter the extraordinary fatigues of this day.\r\n\r\nThe next day, however, being Sunday, we looked forward to as a day of\r\nrest, of recreation, and thanksgiving to the great God who had\r\npreserved us.\r\n\r\nSupper was now ready, my wife took a large earthen pot from the fire,\r\nwhich contained a good stew, made of the flamingo, which Ernest had told\r\nher was an old bird, and would not be eatable, if dressed any other way.\r\nHis brothers laughed heartily, and called him the cook. He was, however,\r\nquite right, the stew, well seasoned, was excellent, and we picked the\r\nvery bones. Whilst we were thus occupied, the living flamingo,\r\naccompanying the rest of the fowls, and free from bonds, came in, quite\r\ntame, to claim his share of the repast, evidently quite unsuspicious\r\nthat we were devouring his mate; he did not seem at all inclined to quit\r\nus. The little monkey, too, was quite at home with the boys, leaping\r\nfrom one to another for food, which he took in his forepaws, and ate\r\nwith such absurd mimicry of their actions, that he kept us in continual\r\nconvulsions of laughter. To augment our satisfaction, our great sow, who\r\nhad deserted us for two days, returned of her own accord, grunting her\r\njoy at our re-union. My wife welcomed her with particular distinction,\r\ntreating her with all the milk we had to spare; for, as she had no dairy\r\nutensils to make cheese and butter, it was best thus to dispose of our\r\nsuperfluity. I promised her, on our next voyage to the ship, to procure\r\nall these necessaries. This she could not, however, hear of, without\r\nshuddering.\r\n\r\nThe boys now lighted the fires for the night. The dogs were tied to the\r\nroots of the tree, as a protection against invaders, and we commenced\r\nour ascent. My three eldest sons soon ran up the ladder, my wife\r\nfollowed, with more deliberation, but arrived safely; my own journey was\r\nmore difficult, as, besides having to carry Francis on my back, I had\r\ndetached the lower part of the ladder from the roots, where it was\r\nnailed; in order to be able to draw it up during the night. We were thus\r\nas safe in our castle as the knights of old, when their drawbridge was\r\nraised. We retired to our hammocks free from care, and did not wake till\r\nthe sun shone brightly in upon us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning, all awoke in good spirits; I told them that on this, the\r\nLord’s day, we would do no work. That it was appointed, not only for a\r\nday of rest, but a day when we must, as much as possible, turn our\r\nhearts from the vanities of the world, to God himself; thank him,\r\nworship him, and serve him. Jack thought we could not do this without a\r\nchurch and a priest; but Ernest believed that God would hear our prayers\r\nunder his own sky, and papa could give them a sermon; Francis wished to\r\nknow if God would like to hear them sing the beautiful hymns mamma had\r\ntaught them, without an organ accompaniment.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear children,” said I, “God is everywhere; and to bless him,\r\nto praise him in all his works, to submit to his holy will, and to obey\r\nhim,—is to serve him. But everything in its time. Let us first attend\r\nto the wants of our animals, and breakfast, and we will then begin the\r\nservices of the day by a hymn.”\r\n\r\nWe descended, and breakfasted on warm milk, fed our animals, and then,\r\nmy children and their mother seated on the turf, I placed myself on a\r\nlittle eminence before them, and, after the service of the day, which I\r\nknew by heart, and singing some portions of the 119th Psalm, I told them\r\na little allegory.\r\n\r\n“There was once on a time a great king, whose kingdom was called the\r\nLand of _Light_ and _Reality_, because there reigned there constant\r\nlight and incessant activity. On the most remote frontier of this\r\nkingdom, towards the north, there was another large kingdom, equally\r\nsubject to his rule, and of which none but himself knew the immense\r\nextent. From time immemorial, an exact plan of this kingdom had been\r\npreserved in the archives. It was called the Land of Obscurity, or\r\n_Night_, because everything in it was dark and inactive.\r\n\r\n“In the most fertile and agreeable part of the empire of Reality, the\r\nking had a magnificent residence, called _The Heavenly City_, where he\r\nheld his brilliant court. Millions of servants executed his\r\nwishes—still more were ready to receive his orders. The first were\r\nclothed in glittering robes, whiter than snow—for white was the colour\r\nof the Great King, as the emblem of purity. Others were clothed in\r\narmour, shining like the colours of the rainbow, and carried flaming\r\nswords in their hands. Each, at his master’s nod, flew like lightning to\r\naccomplish his will. All his servants—faithful, vigilant, bold, and\r\nardent—were united in friendship, and could imagine no happiness\r\ngreater than the favour of their master. There were some, less elevated,\r\nwho were still good, rich, and happy in the favours of their sovereign,\r\nto whom all his subjects were alike, and were treated by him as\r\nhis children.\r\n\r\n“Not far from the frontiers, the Great King possessed a desert island,\r\nwhich he desired to people and cultivate, in order to make it, for a\r\ntime, the abode of those of his subjects whom he intended to admit, by\r\ndegrees, into his _Heavenly City_—a favour he wished to bestow on the\r\ngreatest number possible.\r\n\r\n“This island was called _Earthly Abode_; and he who had passed some time\r\nthere, worthily, was to be received into all the happiness of the\r\nheavenly city. To attain this, the Great King equipped a fleet to\r\ntransport the colonists, whom he chose from the kingdom of _Night_, to\r\nthis island, where he gave them light and activity—advantages they had\r\nnot known before. Think how joyful their arrival would be! The island\r\nwas fertile when cultivated; and all was prepared to make the time pass\r\nagreeably, till they were admitted to their highest honours.\r\n\r\n“At the moment of embarkation, the Great King sent his own son, who\r\nspoke thus to them in His name:—\r\n\r\n“‘My dear children, I have called you from inaction and insensibility to\r\nrender you happy by feeling, by action, by life. Never forget I am your\r\nking, and obey my commands, by cultivating the country I confide to you.\r\nEvery one will receive his portion of land, and wise and learned men are\r\nappointed to explain my will to you. I wish you all to acquire the\r\nknowledge of my laws, and that every father should keep a copy, to read\r\ndaily to his children, that they may never be forgotten. And on the\r\nfirst day of the week you must all assemble, as brothers, in one place,\r\nto hear these laws read and explained. Thus it will be easy for every\r\none to learn the best method of improving his land, what to plant, and\r\nhow to cleanse it from the tares that might choke the good seed. All may\r\nask what they desire, and every reasonable demand will be granted, if it\r\nbe conformable to the great end.\r\n\r\n“‘If you feel grateful for these benefits, and testify it by increased\r\nactivity, and by occupying yourself on this day in expressing your\r\ngratitude to me, I will take care this day of rest shall be a benefit,\r\nand not a loss. I wish that all your useful animals, and even the wild\r\nbeasts of the plains, should on this day repose in peace.\r\n\r\n“‘He who obeys my commands in _Earthly Abode_, shall receive a rich\r\nreward in the _Heavenly City;_ but the idle, the negligent, and the\r\nevil-disposed, shall be condemned to perpetual slavery, or to labour in\r\nmines, in the bowels of the earth.\r\n\r\n“‘From time to time, I shall send ships, to bring away individuals, to\r\nbe rewarded or punished, as they have fulfilled my commands. None can\r\ndeceive me; a magic mirror will show me the actions and thoughts\r\nof all,’\r\n\r\n“The colonists were satisfied, and eager to begin their labour. The\r\nportions of land and instruments of labour were distributed to them,\r\nwith seeds, and useful plants, and fruit-trees. They were then left to\r\nturn these good gifts to profit.\r\n\r\n“But what followed? Every one did as he wished. Some planted their\r\nground with groves and gardens, pretty and useless. Others planted wild\r\nfruit, instead of the good fruit the Great King had commanded. A third\r\nhad sowed good seed; but, not knowing the tares from the wheat, he had\r\ntorn up all before they reached maturity. But the most part left their\r\nland uncultivated; they had lost their seeds, or spoiled their\r\nimplements. Many would not understand the orders of the great king; and\r\nothers tried, by subtlety, to evade them.\r\n\r\n“A few laboured with courage, as they had been taught, rejoicing in the\r\nhope of the promise given them. Their greatest danger was in the\r\ndisbelief of their teachers. Though every one had a copy of the law, few\r\nread it; all were ready, by some excuse, to avoid this duty. Some\r\nasserted they knew it, yet never thought on it: some called these the\r\nlaws of past times; not of the present. Other said the Great King did\r\nnot regard the actions of his subjects, that he had neither mines nor\r\ndungeons, and that all would certainly be taken to the _Heavenly City_.\r\nThey began to neglect the duties of the day dedicated to the Great King.\r\nFew assembled; and of these, the most part were inattentive, and did not\r\nprofit by the instruction given them.\r\n\r\n“But the Great King was faithful to his word. From time to time,\r\nfrigates arrived, bearing the name of some disease. These were followed\r\nby a large vessel called _The Grave_, bearing the terrible flag of the\r\nAdmiral _Death_; this flag was of two colours, green and black; and\r\nappeared to the colonists, according to their state, the smiling colour\r\nof _Hope_, or the gloomy hue of _Despa’r._\r\n\r\n“This fleet always arrived unexpectedly, and was usually unwelcome. The\r\nofficers were sent out, by the admiral, to seize those he pointed out:\r\nmany who were unwilling were compelled to go; and others whose land was\r\nprepared, and even the harvest ripening, were summoned; but these went\r\njoyfully, sure that they went to happiness. The fleet being ready,\r\nsailed for the _Heavenly City_. Then the Great King, in his justice,\r\nawarded the punishments and recompenses. Excuses were now too late; the\r\nnegligent and disobedient were sent to labour in the dark mines; while\r\nthe faithful and obedient, arrayed in bright robes, were received into\r\ntheir glorious abodes of happiness.\r\n\r\n“I have finished my parable, my dear children; reflect on it, and profit\r\nby it. Fritz, what do you think of it?”\r\n\r\n“I am considering the goodness of the Great King, and the ingratitude of\r\nhis people,” answered he.\r\n\r\n“And how very foolish they were,” said Ernest, “with a little prudence,\r\nthey might have kept their land in good condition, and secured a\r\npleasant life afterwards.”\r\n\r\n“Away with them to the mines!” cried Jack, “they richly deserved such a\r\ndoom.”\r\n\r\n“How much I should like,” said Francis, “to see those soldiers in their\r\nshining armour!”\r\n\r\n“I hope you will see them some day, my dear boy, if you continue to be\r\ngood and obedient.” I then explained my parable fully, and applied the\r\nmoral to each of my sons directly.\r\n\r\n“You, Fritz, should take warning from the people who planted wild fruit,\r\nand wished to make them pass for good fruit. Such are those who are\r\nproud of natural virtues, easy to exercise,—such as bodily strength,\r\nor physical courage; and place these above the qualities which are only\r\nattained by labour and patience.\r\n\r\n“You, Ernest, must remember the subjects who laid out their land in\r\nflowery gardens; like those who seek the pleasures of life, rather than\r\nthe duties. And you, my thoughtless Jack, and little Francis, think of\r\nthe fate of those who left their land untilled, or heedlessly sowed\r\ntares for wheat. These are God’s people who neither study nor reflect;\r\nwho cast to the winds all instruction, and leave room in their minds for\r\nevil. Then let us all be, like the good labourers of the parable,\r\nconstantly cultivating our ground, that, when Death comes for us, we may\r\nwillingly follow him to the feet of the Great King, to hear these\r\nblessed words: ‘Good and faithful servants! enter into the joy of\r\nyour Lord!’”\r\n\r\nThis made a great impression on my children. We concluded by singing a\r\nhymn. Then my good wife produced from her unfailing bag, a copy of the\r\nHoly Scripture, from which I selected such passages as applied to our\r\nsituation; and explained them to my best ability. My boys remained for\r\nsome time thoughtful and serious, and though they followed their\r\ninnocent recreations during the day, they did not lose sight of the\r\nuseful lesson of the morning, but, by a more gentle and amiable manner,\r\nshowed that my words had taken effect.\r\n\r\nThe next morning, Ernest had used my bow, which I had given him, very\r\nskilfully; bringing down some dozens of small birds, a sort of ortolan,\r\nfrom the branches of our tree, where they assembled to feed on the figs.\r\nThis induced them all to wish for such a weapon. I was glad to comply\r\nwith their wishes, as I wished them to become skilful in the use of\r\nthese arms of our forefathers, which might be of great value to us, when\r\nour ammunition failed. I made two bows; and two quivers, to contain\r\ntheir arrows, of a flexible piece of bark, and, attaching a strap to\r\nthem, I soon armed my little archers.\r\n\r\nFritz was engaged in preparing the skin of the margay, with more care\r\nthan Jack had shown with that of the jackal. I showed him how to clean\r\nit, by rubbing it with sand in the river, till no vestige of fat or\r\nflesh was left; and then applying butter, to render it flexible.\r\n\r\nThese employments filled up the morning till dinner-time came. We had\r\nErnest’s ortolans, and some fried ham and eggs, which made us a\r\nsumptuous repast. I gave my boys leave to kill as many ortolans as they\r\nchose, for I knew that, half-roasted, and put into casks, covered with\r\nbutter, they would keep for a length of time, and prove an invaluable\r\nresource in time of need. As I continued my work, making arrows, and a\r\nbow for Francis, I intimated to my wife that the abundant supply of figs\r\nwould save our grain, as the poultry and pigeons would feed on them, as\r\nwell as the ortolans. This was a great satisfaction to her. And thus\r\nanother day passed, and we mounted to our dormitory, to taste the sweet\r\nslumber that follows a day of toil.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, all were engaged in archery: I completed the bow for\r\nFrancis, and at his particular request made him a quiver too. The\r\ndelicate bark of a tree, united by glue, obtained from our portable\r\nsoup, formed an admirable quiver; this I suspended by a string round the\r\nneck of my boy, furnished with arrows; then taking his bow in his hand,\r\nhe was as proud as a knight armed at all points.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, I proposed that we should give names to all the parts of\r\nour island known to us, in order that, by a pleasing delusion, we might\r\nfancy ourselves in an inhabited country. My proposal was well received,\r\nand then began the discussion of names. Jack wished for something\r\nhigh-sounding and difficult, such as _Monomotapa_ or _Zanguebar_; very\r\ndifficult words, to puzzle any one that visited our island. But I\r\nobjected to this, as _we_ were the most likely to have to use the names\r\nourselves, and we should suffer from it. I rather suggested that we\r\nshould give, in our own language, such simple names as should point out\r\nsome circumstance connected with the spot. I proposed we should begin\r\nwith the bay where we landed, and called on Fritz for his name.\r\n\r\n“_The Bay of Oysters_” said he,—“we found so many there.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no!” said Jack, “let it be _Lobster Bay_; for there I was caught by\r\nthe leg.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF THE HAPPY ISLAND.\r\n\r\nA.

The river was to\r\nbe _Jackal River_, and the bridge, _Family Bridge_. The most difficult\r\npoint was, to name our present abode. At last we agreed on the name of\r\n_Falcon’s Nest_ (in German _Falken-hoist)_. This was received with\r\nacclamations, and I poured out for my young nestlings each a glass of\r\nsweet wine, to drink Prosperity to _Falcon’s Nest_. We thus laid the\r\nfoundation of the geography of our new country, promising to forward it\r\nto Europe by the first post.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, my sons returned to their occupation as tanners, Fritz to\r\ncomplete his belt, and Jack to make a sort of cuirass, of the formidable\r\nskin of the porcupine, to protect the dogs. He finished by making a sort\r\nof helmet from the head of the animal, as strange as the cuirasses.\r\n\r\nThe heat of the day being over, we prepared to set out to walk to Tent\r\nHouse, to renew our stock of provisions, and endeavour to bring the\r\ngeese and ducks to our new residence; but, instead of going by the\r\ncoast, we proposed to go up the river till we reached the chain of\r\nrocks, and continue under their shade till we got to the cascade, where\r\nwe could cross, and return by Family Bridge.\r\n\r\nThis was approved, and we set out. Fritz, decorated with his beautiful\r\nbelt of skin, Jack in his porcupine helmet. Each had a gun and game-bag;\r\nexcept Francis, who, with his pretty fair face, his golden hair, and his\r\nbow and quiver, was a perfect Cupid. My wife was loaded with a large\r\nbutter-pot for a fresh supply. Turk walked before us with his coat of\r\nmail, and Flora followed, peeping at a respectful distance from him, for\r\nfear of the darts. _Knips_, as my boys called the monkey, finding this\r\nnew saddle very inconvenient, jumped off, with many contortions, but\r\nsoon fixed on Flora, who, not being able to shake him off, was compelled\r\nto become his palfrey.\r\n\r\nThe road by the river was smooth and pleasant. When we reached the end\r\nof the wood, the country seemed more open; and now the boys, who had\r\nbeen rambling about, came running up, out of breath; Ernest was holding\r\na plant with leaves and flowers, and green apples hanging on it.\r\n\r\n“Potatoes!” said he; “I am certain they are potatoes!”\r\n\r\n“God be praised,” said I; “this precious plant will secure provision for\r\nour colony.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Jack, “if his superior knowledge discovered them, I will be\r\nthe first to dig them up;” and he set to work so ardently, that we had\r\nsoon a bag of fine ripe potatoes, which we carried on to Tent House.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had been much delighted with the new and lovely scenery of our road:\r\nthe prickly cactus, and aloe, with its white flowers; the Indian fig;\r\nthe white and yellow jasmine; the fragrant vanilla, throwing round its\r\ngraceful festoons. Above all, the regal pineapple grew in profusion,\r\nand we feasted on it, for the first time, with avidity.\r\n\r\nAmong the prickly stalks of the cactus and aloes, I perceived a plant\r\nwith large pointed leaves, which I knew to be the _karata_. I pointed\r\nout to the boys its beautiful red flowers; the leaves are an excellent\r\napplication to wounds, and thread is made from the filaments, and the\r\npith of the stem is used by the savage tribes for tinder.\r\n\r\nWhen I showed the boys, by experiment, the use of the pith, they thought\r\nthe _tinder-tree_ would be almost as useful as the potatoes.\r\n\r\n“At all events,” I said, “it will be more useful than the pine-apples;\r\nyour mother will be thankful for thread, when her enchanted bag is\r\nexhausted.”\r\n\r\n“How happy it is for us,” said she, “that you have devoted yourself to\r\nreading and study. In our ignorance we might have passed this treasure,\r\nwithout suspecting its value.”\r\n\r\nFritz inquired of what use in the world all the rest of these prickly\r\nplants could be, which wounded every one that came near.\r\n\r\n“All these have their use, Fritz,” said I; “some contain juices and\r\ngums, which are daily made use of in medicine; others are useful in the\r\narts, or in manufactures. The Indian fig, for instance, is a most\r\ninteresting tree. It grows in the most arid soil. The fruit is said to\r\nbe sweet and wholesome.”\r\n\r\nIn a moment, my little active Jack was climbing the rocks to gather some\r\nof these figs; but he had not remarked that they were covered with\r\nthousands of slender thorns, finer than the finest needles, which\r\nterribly wounded his fingers. He returned, weeping bitterly and dancing\r\nwith pain. Having rallied him a little for his greediness, I extracted\r\nthe thorns, and then showed him how to open the fruit, by first cutting\r\noff the pointed end, as it lay on the ground; into this I fixed a piece\r\nof stick, and then pared it with my knife. The novelty of the expedient\r\nrecommended it, and they were soon all engaged eating the fruit, which\r\nthey declared was very good.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, I saw Ernest examining one of the figs very\r\nattentively. “Oh! papa!” said he, “what a singular sight; the fig is\r\ncovered with a small red insect. I cannot shake them off. Can they be\r\nthe _Cochineal_?” I recognized at once the precious insect, of which I\r\nexplained to my sons the nature and use. “It is with this insect,” said\r\nI, “that the beautiful and rich scarlet dye is made. It is found in\r\nAmerica, and the Europeans give its weight in gold for it.”\r\n\r\nThus discoursing on the wonders of nature, and the necessity of\r\nincreasing our knowledge by observation and study, we arrived at Tent\r\nHouse, and found it in the same state as we left it.\r\n\r\nWe all began to collect necessaries. Fritz loaded himself with powder\r\nand shot, I opened the butter-cask, and my wife and little Francis\r\nfilled the pot. Ernest and Jack went to try and secure the geese and\r\nducks; but they had become so wild that it would have been impossible,\r\nif Ernest had not thought of an expedient. He tied pieces of cheese, for\r\nbait, to threads, which he floated on the water. The voracious creatures\r\nimmediately swallowed the cheese and were drawn out by the thread. They\r\nwere then securely tied, and fastened to the game-bags, to be carried\r\nhome on our backs. As the bait could not be recovered, the boys\r\ncontented themselves with cutting off the string close to the beak,\r\nleaving them to digest the rest.\r\n\r\nOur bags were already loaded with potatoes, but we filled up the spaces\r\nbetween them with salt; and, having relieved Turk of his armour, we\r\nplaced the heaviest on his back. I took the butter-pot; and, after\r\nreplacing everything, and closing our tent, we resumed our march, with\r\nour ludicrous incumbrances. The geese and ducks were very noisy in their\r\nadieu to their old marsh; the dogs barked; and we all laughed so\r\nexcessively, that we forgot our burdens till we sat down again under our\r\ntree. My wife soon had her pot of potatoes on the fire. She then milked\r\nthe cow and goat, while I set the fowls at liberty on the banks of the\r\nriver. We then sat down to a smoking dish of potatoes, a jug of milk,\r\nand butter and cheese. After supper we had prayers, thanking God\r\nespecially for his new benefits; and we then sought our repose among\r\nthe leaves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had observed on the shore, the preceding day, a quantity of wood,\r\nwhich I thought would suit to make a sledge, to convey our casks and\r\nheavy stores from Tent House to Falcon’s Nest. At dawn of day I woke\r\nErnest, whose inclination to indolence I wished to overcome, and leaving\r\nthe rest asleep, we descended, and harnessing the ass to a strong branch\r\nof a tree that was lying near, we proceeded to the shore. I had no\r\ndifficulty in selecting proper pieces of wood; we sawed them the right\r\nlength, tied them together, and laid them across the bough, which the\r\npatient animal drew very contentedly. We added to the load a small chest\r\nwe discovered half buried in the sand, and we returned homewards, Ernest\r\nleading the ass, and I assisted by raising the load with a lever when we\r\nmet with any obstruction. My wife had been rather alarmed; but seeing\r\nthe result of our expedition, and hearing of the prospect of a sledge,\r\nshe was satisfied. I opened the chest, which contained only some\r\nsailors’ dresses and some linen, both wetted with sea-water; but likely\r\nto be very useful as our own clothes decayed. I found Fritz and Jack had\r\nbeen shooting ortolans; they had killed about fifty, but had consumed so\r\nmuch powder and shot, that I checked a prodigality so imprudent in our\r\nsituation. I taught them to make snares for the birds of the threads we\r\ndrew from the karata-leaves we had brought home. My wife and her two\r\nyounger sons busied themselves with these, while I, with my two elder\r\nboys, began to construct the sledge. As we were working, we heard a\r\ngreat noise among the fowls, and Ernest, looking about, discovered the\r\nmonkey seizing and hiding the eggs from the nests; he had collected a\r\ngood store in a hole among the roots, which Ernest carried to his\r\nmother; and Knips was punished by being tied up, every morning, till the\r\neggs were collected.\r\n\r\nOur work was interrupted by dinner, composed of ortolans, milk, and\r\ncheese. After dinner, Jack had climbed to the higher branches of the\r\ntrees to place his snares, and found the pigeons were making nests. I\r\nthen told him to look often to the snares, for fear our own poor birds\r\nshould be taken; and, above all, never in future to fire into the tree.\r\n\r\n“Papa,” said little Francis, “can we not sow some gunpowder, and then we\r\nshall have plenty?” This proposal was received with shouts of laughter,\r\nwhich greatly discomposed the little innocent fellow. Professor Ernest\r\nimmediately seized the opportunity to give a lecture on the composition\r\nof gunpowder.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day my sledge was finished. Two long curved planks of\r\nwood, crossed by three pieces, at a distance from each other, formed the\r\nsimple conveyance. The fore and hind parts were in the form of horns, to\r\nkeep the load from falling off. Two ropes were fastened to the front,\r\nand my sledge was complete. My wife was delighted with it, and hoped I\r\nwould now set out immediately to Tent House for the butter-cask. I made\r\nno objection to this; and Ernest and I prepared to go, and leave Fritz\r\nin charge of the family.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we were ready to set out, Fritz presented each of us with a little\r\ncase he had made from the skin of the margay. They were ingeniously\r\ncontrived to contain knife, fork, and spoon, and a small hatchet. We\r\nthen harnessed the ass and the cow to the sledge, took a flexible bamboo\r\ncane for a whip, and, followed by Flora, we departed, leaving Turk to\r\nguard the tree.\r\n\r\nWe went by the shore, as the better road for the sledge, and crossing\r\nFamily Bridge, were soon at Tent House. After unharnessing the animals,\r\nwe began to load. We took the cask of butter, the cheese, and the\r\nbiscuit; all the rest of our utensils, powder, shot, and Turk’s armour,\r\nwhich we had left there. These labours had so occupied us, that we had\r\nnot observed that our animals, attracted by the pasturage, had crossed\r\nthe bridge, and wandered out of sight. I sent Ernest to seek them, and\r\nin the mean time went to the bay, where I discovered some convenient\r\nlittle hollows in the rock, that seemed cut out for baths. I called\r\nErnest to come, and till he arrived, employed myself in cutting some\r\nrushes, which I thought might be useful. When my son came, I found he\r\nhad ingeniously removed the first planks from the bridge, to prevent the\r\nanimals straying over again. We then had a very pleasant bath, and\r\nErnest being out first, I sent him to the rock, where the salt was\r\naccumulated, to fill a small bag, to be transferred to the large bags on\r\nthe ass. He had not been absent long, when I heard him cry out, “Papa!\r\npapa! a huge fish! I cannot hold it; it will break my line.” I ran to\r\nhis assistance, and found him lying on the ground on his face, tugging\r\nat his line, to which an enormous salmon was attached, that had nearly\r\npulled him into the water. I let it have a little more line, then drew\r\nit gently into a shallow, and secured it. It appeared about fifteen\r\npounds weight; and we pleased ourselves with the idea of presenting this\r\nto our good cook. Ernest said, he remembered having remarked how this\r\nplace swarmed with fish, and he took care to bring his rod with him; he\r\nhad taken about a dozen small fishes, which he had in his handkerchief,\r\nbefore he was overpowered by the salmon. I cut the fishes open, and\r\nrubbed the inside with salt, to preserve them; then placing them in a\r\nsmall box on the sledge, and adding our bags of salt, we harnessed our\r\nanimals, and set off homewards.\r\n\r\nWhen we were about half-way, Flora left us, and, by her barking, raised\r\na singular animal, which seemed to leap instead of run. The irregular\r\nbounds of the animal disconcerted my aim, and, though very near, I\r\nmissed it. Ernest was more fortunate; he fired at it, and killed it. It\r\nwas an animal about the size of a sheep, with the tail of a tiger; its\r\nhead and skin were like those of a mouse, ears longer than the hare;\r\nthere was a curious pouch on the belly; the fore legs were short, as if\r\nimperfectly developed, and armed with strong claws, the hind legs long,\r\nlike a pair of stilts. After Ernest’s pride of victory was a little\r\nsubdued, he fell back on his science, and began to examine his spoil.\r\n\r\n“By its teeth,” said he, “it should belong to the family of _rodentes_,\r\nor gnawers; by its legs, to the _jumpers_; and by its pouch, to the\r\nopossum tribe.”\r\n\r\nThis gave me the right clue. “Then,” said I, “this must be the animal\r\nCook first discovered in New Holland, and it is called the _kangaroo_.”\r\n\r\nWe now tied the legs of the animal together, and, putting a stick\r\nthrough, carried it to the sledge very carefully, for Ernest was anxious\r\nto preserve the beautiful skin. Our animals were heavily laden; but,\r\ngiving them a little rest and some fresh grass, we once more started,\r\nand in a short time reached Falcon’s Nest.\r\n\r\nMy wife had been employed during our absence in washing the clothes of\r\nthe three boys, clothing them in the mean time from the sailor’s chest\r\nwe had found a few days before. Their appearance was excessively\r\nridiculous, as the garments neither suited their age nor size, and\r\ncaused great mirth to us all; but my wife had preferred this disguise to\r\nthe alternative of their going naked.\r\n\r\nWe now began to display our riches, and relate our adventures. The\r\nbutter and the rest of the provisions were very welcome, the salmon\r\nstill more so, but the sight of the kangaroo produced screams of\r\nadmiration. Fritz displayed a little jealousy, but soon surmounted it by\r\nan exertion of his nobler feelings; and only the keen eye of a father\r\ncould have discovered it. He congratulated Ernest warmly, but could not\r\nhelp begging to accompany me next time.\r\n\r\n“I promise you that,” said I, “as a reward for the conquest you have\r\nachieved over your jealousy of your brother. But, remember, I could not\r\nhave given you a greater proof of my confidence, than in leaving you to\r\nprotect your mother and brothers. A noble mind finds its purest joy in\r\nthe accomplishment of its duty, and to that willingly sacrifices its\r\ninclination. But,” I added, in a low tone, lest I should distress my\r\nwife, “I propose another expedition to the vessel, and you must\r\naccompany me.”\r\n\r\nWe then fed our tired animals, giving them some salt with their grass, a\r\ngreat treat to them. Some salmon was prepared for dinner, and the rest\r\nsalted. After dinner, I hung up the kangaroo till next day, when we\r\nintended to salt and smoke the flesh. Evening arrived, and an excellent\r\nsupper of fish, ortolans, and potatoes refreshed us; and, after thanks\r\nto God, we retired to rest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nI rose early, and descended the ladder, a little uneasy about my\r\nkangaroo, and found I was but just in time to save it, for my dogs had\r\nso enjoyed their repast on the entrails, which I had given them the\r\nnight before, that they wished to appropriate the rest. They had\r\nsucceeded in tearing off the head, which was in their reach, and were\r\ndevouring it in a sort of growling partnership. As we had no store-room\r\nfor our provision, I decided to administer a little correction, as a\r\nwarning to these gluttons. I gave them some smart strokes with a cane,\r\nand they fled howling to the stable under the roots. Their cries roused\r\nmy wife, who came down; and, though she could not but allow the\r\nchastisement to be just and prudent, she was so moved by compassion,\r\nthat she consoled the poor sufferers with some remains of last\r\nnight’s supper.\r\n\r\nI now carefully stripped the kangaroo of his elegant skin, and washing\r\nmyself, and changing my dress after this unpleasant operation, I joined\r\nmy family at breakfast. I then announced my plan of visiting the vessel,\r\nand ordered Fritz to make preparations. My wife resigned herself\r\nmournfully to the necessity. When we were ready to depart, Ernest and\r\nJack were not to be found; their mother suspected they had gone to get\r\npotatoes. This calmed my apprehension; but I charged her to reprimand\r\nthem for going without leave. We set out towards Tent House, leaving\r\nFlora to protect the household, and taking our guns as usual.\r\n\r\nWe had scarcely left the wood, and were approaching Jackal River, when\r\nwe heard piercing cries, and suddenly Ernest and Jack leaped from a\r\nthicket, delighted, as Jack said, in having succeeded in their plan of\r\naccompanying us, and, moreover, in making us believe we were beset with\r\nsavages. They were, however, disappointed. I gave them a severe reproof\r\nfor their disobedience, and sent them home with a message to their\r\nmother that I thought we might be detained all night, and begged she\r\nwould not be uneasy.\r\n\r\nThey listened to me in great confusion, and were much mortified at\r\ntheir dismissal; but I begged Fritz to give Ernest his silver watch,\r\nthat they might know how the time passed; and I knew that I could\r\nreplace it, as there was a case of watches in the ship. This reconciled\r\nthem a little to their lot, and they left us. We went forward to our\r\nboat, embarked, and, aided by the current, soon reached the vessel.\r\n\r\nMy first care was to construct some more convenient transport-vessel\r\nthan our boat. Fritz proposed a raft, similar to those used by savage\r\nnations, supported on skins filled with air. These we had not; but we\r\nfound a number of water-hogsheads, which we emptied, and closed again,\r\nand threw a dozen of them into the sea, between the ship and our boat.\r\nSome long planks were laid on these, and secured with ropes. We added a\r\nraised edge of planks to secure our cargo, and thus had a solid raft,\r\ncapable of conveying any burden. This work occupied us the whole day,\r\nscarcely interrupted by eating a little cold meat from our game-bags.\r\nExhausted by fatigue, we were glad to take a good night’s rest in the\r\ncaptain’s cabin on an elastic mattress, of which our hammocks had made\r\nus forget the comfort. Early next morning we began to load our raft.\r\n\r\nWe began by entirely stripping our own cabin and that of the captain. We\r\ncarried away even the doors and windows. The chests of the carpenter and\r\nthe gunner followed. There were cases of rich jewellery, and caskets of\r\nmoney, which at first tempted us, but were speedily relinquished for\r\nobjects of real utility. I preferred a case of young plants of European\r\nfruits, carefully packed in moss for transportation. I saw, with\r\ndelight, among these precious plants, apple, pear, plum, orange,\r\napricot, peach, almond, and chesnut trees, and some young shoots of\r\nvines. How I longed to plant these familiar trees of home in a foreign\r\nsoil. We secured some bars of iron and pigs of lead, grindstones,\r\ncart-wheels ready for mounting, tongs, shovels, plough-shares, packets\r\nof copper and iron wire, sacks of maize, peas, oats, and vetches; and\r\neven a small hand-mill. The vessel had been, in fact, laden with\r\neverything likely to be useful in a new colony. We found a saw-mill in\r\npieces, but marked, so that it could be easily put together. It was\r\ndifficult to select, but we took as much as was safe on the raft, adding\r\na large fishing-net and the ship’s compass. Fritz begged to take the\r\nharpoons, which he hung by the ropes over the bow of our boat; and I\r\nindulged his fancy. We were now loaded as far as prudence would allow\r\nus; so, attaching our raft firmly to the boat, we hoisted our sail, and\r\nmade slowly to the shore.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wind was favourable, but we advanced slowly, the floating mass that\r\nwe had to tug retarding us. Fritz had been some time regarding a large\r\nobject in the water; he called me to steer a little towards it, that he\r\nmight see what it was. I went to the rudder, and made the movement;\r\nimmediately I heard the whistling of the cord, and felt a shock; then a\r\nsecond, which was followed by a rapid motion of the boat.\r\n\r\n“We are going to founder!” cried I. “What is the matter?”\r\n\r\n“I have caught it,” shouted Fritz; “I have harpooned it in the neck. It\r\nis a turtle.”\r\n\r\nI saw the harpoon shining at a distance, and the turtle was rapidly\r\ndrawing us along by the line. I lowered the sail, and rushed forward to\r\ncut the line; but Fritz besought me not to do it. He assured me there\r\nwas no danger, and that he himself would release us if necessary. I\r\nreluctantly consented, and saw our whole convoy drawn by an animal whose\r\nagony increased its strength. As we drew near the shore, I endeavoured\r\nto steer so that we might not strike and be capsized. I saw after a few\r\nminutes that our conductor again wanted to make out to sea; I therefore\r\nhoisted the sail, and the wind being in our favour, he found resistance\r\nvain, and, tugging as before, followed up the current, only taking more\r\nto the left, towards Falcon’s Nest, and landing us in a shallow, rested\r\non the shore. I leaped out of the boat, and with a hatchet soon put our\r\npowerful conductor out of his misery.\r\n\r\nFritz uttered a shout of joy, and fired off his gun, as a signal of our\r\narrival. All came running to greet us, and great was their surprise, not\r\nonly at the value of our cargo, but at the strange mode by which it had\r\nbeen brought into harbour. My first care was to send them for the\r\nsledge, to remove some of our load without delay, and as the ebbing tide\r\nwas leaving our vessels almost dry on the sand, I profited by the\r\nopportunity to secure them. By the aid of the jack-screw and levers, we\r\nraised and brought to the shore two large pieces of lead from the raft.\r\nThese served for anchors and, connected to the boat and raft by strong\r\ncables, fixed them safely.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the sledge arrived, we placed the turtle with some difficulty\r\non it, as it weighed at least three hundredweight. We added some lighter\r\narticles, the mattresses, some small chests, &c., and proceeded with our\r\nfirst load to Falcon’s Nest in great spirits. As we walked on, Fritz\r\ntold them of the wondrous cases of jewellery we had abandoned for things\r\nof use; Jack wished Fritz had brought him a gold snuff-box, to hold\r\ncurious seeds; and Francis wished for some of the money to buy\r\ngingerbread at the fair! Everybody laughed at the little simpleton, who\r\ncould not help laughing himself, when he remembered his distance from\r\nfairs. Arrived at home, our first care was to turn the turtle on his\r\nback, to get the excellent meat out of the shell. With my hatchet I\r\nseparated the cartilages that unite the shells: the upper shell is\r\nconvex, the lower one nearly flat.\r\n\r\nWe had some of the turtle prepared for dinner, though my wife felt great\r\nrepugnance in touching the green fat, notwithstanding my assurance of\r\nits being the chief delicacy to an epicure.\r\n\r\nWe salted the remainder of the flesh, and gave the offal to the dogs.\r\nThe boys were all clamorous to possess the shell; but I said it belonged\r\nto Fritz, by right of conquest, and he must dispose of it as he\r\nthought best.\r\n\r\n“Then,” said he, “I will make a basin of it, and place it near the\r\nriver, that my mother may always keep it full of fresh water.”\r\n\r\n“Very good,” said I, “and we will fill our basin, as soon as we find\r\nsome clay to make a solid foundation.”\r\n\r\n“I found some this morning,” said Jack,—“a whole bed of clay, and I\r\nbrought these balls home to show you.”\r\n\r\n“And I have made a discovery too,” said Ernest. “Look at these roots,\r\nlike radishes; I have not eaten any, but the sow enjoys them very much.”\r\n\r\n“A most valuable discovery, indeed,” said I; “if I am not mistaken, this\r\nis the root of the _manioc_, which with the potatoes will insure us from\r\nfamine. Of this root they make in the West Indies a sort of bread,\r\ncalled cassava bread. In its natural state it contains a violent poison,\r\nbut by a process of heating it becomes wholesome. The nutritious tapioca\r\nis a preparation from this root.”\r\n\r\nBy this time we had unloaded, and proceeded to the shore to bring a\r\nsecond load before night came on. We brought up two chests of our own\r\nclothes and property, some chests of tools, the cart-wheels, and the\r\nhand-mill, likely now to be of use for the cassava. After unloading, we\r\nsat down to an excellent supper of turtle, with potatoes, instead of\r\nbread. After supper, my wife said, smiling, “After such a hard day, I\r\nthink I can give you something to restore you.” She then brought a\r\nbottle and glasses, and filled us each a glass of clear, amber-coloured\r\nwine. I found it excellent Malaga. She had been down to the shore the\r\nprevious day, and there found a small cask thrown up by the waves. This,\r\nwith the assistance of her sons, she had rolled up to the foot of our\r\ntree, and there covered it with leaves to keep it cool till our arrival.\r\n\r\nWe were so invigorated by this cordial, that we set briskly to work to\r\nhoist up our mattresses to our dormitory, which we accomplished by the\r\naid of ropes and pulleys. My wife received and arranged them, and after\r\nour usual evening devotions, we gladly lay down on them, to enjoy a\r\nnight of sweet repose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nI rose before daylight, and, leaving my family sleeping, descended, to\r\ngo to the shore to look after my vessels. I found all the animals\r\nmoving. The dogs leaped about me; the cocks were crowing; the goats\r\nbrowsing on the dewy grass. The ass alone was sleeping; and, as he was\r\nthe assistant I wanted, I was compelled to rouse him, a preference which\r\ndid not appear to flatter him. Nevertheless, I harnessed him to the\r\nsledge, and, followed by the dogs, went forward to the coast, where I\r\nfound my boat and raft safe at anchor. I took up a moderate load and\r\ncame home to breakfast; but found all still as I left them. I called my\r\nfamily, and they sprung up ashamed of their sloth; my wife declared it\r\nmust have been the good mattress that had charmed her.\r\n\r\nI gave my boys a short admonition for their sloth. We then came down to\r\na hasty breakfast, and returned to the coast to finish the unloading the\r\nboats, that I might, at high water, take them round to moor at the usual\r\nplace in the Bay of Safety. I sent my wife up with the last load, while\r\nFritz and I embarked, and, seeing Jack watching us, I consented that he\r\nshould form one of the crew, for I had determined to make another visit\r\nto the wreck before I moored my craft. When we reached the vessel, the\r\nday was so far advanced that we had only time to collect hastily\r\nanything easy to embark. My sons ran over the ship. Jack came trundling\r\na wheelbarrow, which he said would be excellent for fetching the\r\npotatoes in.\r\n\r\nBut Fritz brought me good news: he had found, between decks, a beautiful\r\npinnace (a small vessel, of which the prow is square), taken to pieces,\r\nwith all its fittings, and even two small guns. I saw that all the\r\npieces were numbered, and placed in order; nothing was wanting. I felt\r\nthe importance of this acquisition; but it would take days of labour to\r\nput it together; and then how could we launch it? At present, I felt I\r\nmust renounce the undertaking. I returned to my loading. It consisted of\r\nall sorts of utensils: a copper boiler, some plates of iron,\r\ntobacco-graters, two grindstones, a barrel of powder, and one of flints.\r\nJack did not forget his wheelbarrow; and we found two more, which we\r\nadded to our cargo, and then sailed off speedily, to avoid the\r\nland-wind, which rises in the evening.\r\n\r\nAs we drew near, we were astonished to see a row of little creatures\r\nstanding on the shore, apparently regarding us with much curiosity. They\r\nwere dressed in black, with white waistcoats, and thick cravats; their\r\narms hung down carelessly; but from time to time they raised them as if\r\nthey wished to bestow on us a fraternal embrace.\r\n\r\n“I believe,” said I, laughing, “this must be the country of pigmies,\r\nand they are coming to welcome us.”\r\n\r\n“They are the Lilliputians, father,” said Jack; “I have read of them;\r\nbut I thought they had been less.”\r\n\r\n“As if Gulliver’s Travels was true!” said Fritz, in a tone of derision.\r\n\r\n“Then are there no pigmies?” asked he.\r\n\r\n“No, my dear boy,” said I; “all these stories are either the invention\r\nor the mistakes of ancient navigators, who have taken troops of monkeys\r\nfor men, or who have wished to repeat something marvellous. But the\r\nromance of Gulliver is an allegory, intended to convey great truths.”\r\n\r\n“And now,” said Fritz, “I begin to see our pigmies have beaks and\r\nwings.”\r\n\r\n“You are right,” said I; “they are penguins, as Ernest explained to us\r\nsome time since. They are good swimmers; but, unable to fly, are very\r\nhelpless on land.”\r\n\r\nI steered gently to the shore, that I might not disturb them; but Jack\r\nleaped into the water up to his knees, and, dashing among the penguins,\r\nwith a stick struck right and left, knocking down half a dozen of the\r\npoor stupid birds before they were aware. Some of these we brought away\r\nalive. The rest, not liking such a reception, took to the water, and\r\nwere soon out of sight. I scolded Jack for his useless rashness, for the\r\nflesh of the penguin is by no means a delicacy.\r\n\r\nWe now filled our three wheelbarrows with such things as we could\r\ncarry, not forgetting the sheets of iron and the graters, and trudged\r\nhome. Our dogs announced our approach, and all rushed out to meet us. A\r\ncurious and merry examination commenced. They laughed at my graters; but\r\nI let them laugh, for I had a project in my head. The penguins I\r\nintended for our poultry-yard; and, for the present, I ordered the boys\r\nto tie each of them by a leg to one of our geese or ducks, who opposed\r\nthe bondage very clamorously; but necessity made them submissive.\r\n\r\nMy wife showed me a large store of potatoes and manioc roots, which she\r\nand her children had dug up the evening before. We then went to supper,\r\nand talked of all we had seen in the vessel, especially of the pinnace,\r\nwhich we had been obliged to leave. My wife did not feel much regret on\r\nthis account, as she dreaded maritime expeditions, though she agreed she\r\nmight have felt less uneasiness if we had had a vessel of this\r\ndescription. I gave my sons a charge to rise early next morning, as we\r\nhad an important business on hand; and curiosity roused them all in very\r\ngood time. After our usual preparations for the day, I addressed them\r\nthus: “Gentlemen, I am going to teach you all a new business,—that of a\r\nbaker. Give me the plates of iron and the graters we brought yesterday.”\r\nMy wife was astonished; but I requested her to wait patiently and she\r\nshould have bread, not perhaps light buns, but eatable flat cakes. But\r\nfirst she was to make me two small bags of sailcloth. She obeyed me;\r\nbut, at the same time, I observed she put the potatoes on the fire, a\r\nproof she had not much faith in my bread-making. I then spread a cloth\r\nover the ground, and, giving each of the boys a grater, we began to\r\ngrate the carefully-washed manioc roots, resting the end on the cloth.\r\nIn a short time we had a heap of what appeared to be moist white\r\nsawdust; certainly not tempting to the appetite; but the little workmen\r\nwere amused with their labour, and jested no little about the cakes made\r\nof scraped radishes.\r\n\r\n“Laugh now, boys,” said I; “we shall see, after a while. But you,\r\nErnest, ought to know that the manioc is one of the most precious of\r\nalimentary roots, forming the principal sustenance of many nations of\r\nAmerica, and often preferred by Europeans, who inhabit those countries,\r\nto wheaten bread.”\r\n\r\nWhen all the roots were grated, I filled the two bags closely with the\r\npollard, and my wife sewed the ends up firmly. It was now necessary to\r\napply strong pressure to extract the juice from the root, as this juice\r\nis a deadly poison. I selected an oak beam, one end of which we fixed\r\nbetween the roots of our tree; beneath this I placed our bags on a row\r\nof little blocks of wood; I then took a large bough, which I had cut\r\nfrom a tree, and prepared for the purpose, and laid it across them. We\r\nall united then in drawing down the opposite end of the plank over the\r\nbough, till we got it to a certain point, when we suspended to it the\r\nheaviest substances we possessed; hammers, bars of iron, and masses of\r\nlead. This acting upon the manioc, the sap burst through the cloth, and\r\nflowed on the ground copiously. When I thought the pressure was\r\ncomplete, we relieved the bags from the lever, and opening one, drew out\r\na handful of the pollard, still rather moist, resembling coarse\r\nmaize-flour.\r\n\r\n“It only wants a little heat to complete our success,” said I, in great\r\ndelight. I ordered a fire to be lighted, and fixing one of our iron\r\nplates, which was round in form, and rather concave, on two stones\r\nplaced on each side of the fire, I covered it with the flour which we\r\ntook from the bag with a small wooden shovel. It soon formed a solid\r\ncake, which we turned, that it might be equally baked.\r\n\r\nIt smelled so good, that they all wished to commence eating immediately;\r\nand I had some difficulty in convincing them that this was only a trial,\r\nand that our baking was still imperfect. Besides, as I told them there\r\nwere three kinds of manioc, of which one contained more poison than the\r\nrest, I thought it prudent to try whether we had perfectly extracted it,\r\nby giving a small quantity to our fowls. As soon, therefore, as the cake\r\nwas cold, I gave some to two chickens, which I kept apart; and also some\r\nto Master Knips, the monkey, that he might, for the first time, do us a\r\nlittle service. He ate it with so much relish, and such grimaces of\r\nenjoyment, that my young party were quite anxious to share his feast;\r\nbut I ordered them to wait till we could judge of the effect, and,\r\nleaving our employment, we went to our dinner of potatoes, to which my\r\nwife had added one of the penguins, which was truly rather tough and\r\nfishy; but as Jack would not allow this, and declared it was a dish fit\r\nfor a king, we allowed him to regale on it as much as he liked. During\r\ndinner, I talked to them of the various preparations made from the\r\nmanioc; I told my wife we could obtain an excellent starch from the\r\nexpressed juice; but this did not interest her much, as at present she\r\nusually wore the dress of a sailor, for convenience, and had neither\r\ncaps nor collars to starch.\r\n\r\nThe cake made from the root is called by the natives of the Antilles\r\n_cassava_, and in no savage nation do we find any word signifying\r\n_bread_; an article of food unknown to them.\r\n\r\nWe spoke of poisons; and I explained to my sons the different nature and\r\neffects of them. Especially I warned them against the _manchineel_,\r\nwhich ought to grow in this part of the world. I described the fruit to\r\nthem, as resembling a tempting yellow apple, with red spots, which is\r\none of the most deadly poisons: it is said that even to sleep under the\r\ntree is dangerous. I forbade them to taste any unknown fruit, and they\r\npromised to obey me.\r\n\r\nOn leaving the table, we went to visit the victims of our experiment.\r\nJack whistled for Knips, who came in three bounds from the summit of a\r\nhigh tree, where he had doubtless been plundering some nest; and his\r\nvivacity, and the peaceful cackling of the fowls, assured us our\r\npreparation was harmless.\r\n\r\n“Now, gentlemen,” said I, laughing, “to the bakehouse, and let us see\r\nwhat we can do.” I wished them each to try to make the cakes. They\r\nimmediately kindled the fire and heated the iron plate. In the mean\r\ntime, I broke up the grated cassava, and mixed it with a little milk;\r\nand giving each of them a cocoa-nut basin filled with the paste, I\r\nshowed them how to pour it with a spoon upon the plate, and spread it\r\nabout; when the paste began to puff up, I judged it was baked on one\r\nside, and turned it, like a pancake, with a fork; and after a little\r\ntime, we had a quantity of nice yellow biscuits, which, with a jug of\r\nmilk, made us a delicious collation; and determined us, without delay,\r\nto set about cultivating the manioc.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the day was employed in bringing up the remainder of our\r\ncargo, by means of the sledge and the useful wheelbarrows.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning I decided on returning to the wreck. The idea of the\r\npinnace continually haunted my mind, and left me no repose. But it was\r\nnecessary to take all the hands I could raise, and with difficulty I got\r\nmy wife’s consent to take my three elder sons, on promising her we would\r\nreturn in the evening. We set out, taking provision for the day, and\r\nsoon arrived at the vessel, when my boys began to load the raft with all\r\nmanner of portable things. But the great matter was the pinnace. It was\r\ncontained in the after-hold of the vessel, immediately below the\r\nofficers’ berths. My sons, with all the ardour of their age, begged to\r\nbegin by clearing a space in the vessel to put the pinnace together, and\r\nwe might afterwards think how we should launch it. Under any other\r\ncircumstances I should have shown them the folly of such an undertaking;\r\nbut in truth, I had myself a vague hope of success, that encouraged me,\r\nand I cried out, “To work! to work!” The hold was lighted by some chinks\r\nin the ship’s side. We set diligently to work, hacking, cutting, and\r\nsawing away all obstacles, and before evening we had a clear space round\r\nus. But now it was necessary to return, and we put to sea with our\r\ncargo, purposing to continue our work daily. On reaching the Bay of\r\nSafety, we had the pleasure of finding my wife and Francis, who had\r\nestablished themselves at Tent House, intending to continue there till\r\nour visits to the vessel were concluded; that they might always keep us\r\nin sight, and spare us the unnecessary labour of a walk after our\r\nday’s work.\r\n\r\nI thanked my wife tenderly for this kind sacrifice, for I knew how much\r\nshe enjoyed the cool shade of Falcon’s Nest; and in return I showed her\r\nthe treasures we had brought her from the vessel, consisting of two\r\nbarrels of salt butter, three hogsheads of flour, several bags of\r\nmillet, rice, and other grains, and a variety of useful household\r\narticles, which she conveyed with great delight to our storehouse in\r\nthe rocks.\r\n\r\nFor a week we spent every day in the vessel, returning in the evening to\r\nenjoy a good supper, and talk of our progress; and my wife, happily\r\nengrossed with her poultry and other household cares, got accustomed to\r\nour absence. With much hard labour, the pinnace was at last put\r\ntogether. Its construction was light and elegant, it looked as if it\r\nwould sail well; at the head was a short half-deck; the masts and sails\r\nwere like those of a brigantine. We carefully caulked all the seams with\r\ntow dipped in melted tar; and we even indulged ourselves by placing the\r\ntwo small guns in it, fastened by chains.\r\n\r\nAnd there stood the beautiful little bark, immovable on the stocks. We\r\nadmired it incessantly; but what could we do to get it afloat? The\r\ndifficulty of forcing a way through the mighty timbers lined with\r\ncopper, that formed the side of the ship, was insurmountable.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, suggested by the excess of my despair, a bold but dangerous\r\nidea presented itself to me, in which all might be lost, as well as all\r\ngained. I said nothing about this to my children, to avoid the vexation\r\nof a possible disappointment, but began to execute my plan.\r\n\r\nI found a cast-iron mortar, exactly fitted for my purpose, which I\r\nfilled with gunpowder. I then took a strong oak plank to cover it, to\r\nwhich I fixed iron hooks, so that they could reach the handles of the\r\nmortar. I cut a groove in the side of the plank, that I might introduce\r\na long match, which should burn at least two hours before it reached the\r\npowder. I placed the plank then over the mortar, fastened the hooks\r\nthrough the handles, surrounded it with pitch, and then bound some\r\nstrong chains round the whole, to give it greater solidity. I proceeded\r\nto suspend this infernal machine against the side of the ship near our\r\nwork, taking care to place it where the recoil from the explosion should\r\nnot injure the pinnace. When all was ready, I gave the signal of\r\ndeparture, my sons having been employed in the boat, and not observing\r\nmy preparations. I remained a moment to fire the match, and then hastily\r\njoined them with a beating heart, and proceeded to the shore.\r\n\r\nAs soon as we reached our harbour, I detached the raft, that I might\r\nreturn in the boat as soon as I heard the explosion. We began actively\r\nto unload the boat, and while thus employed, a report like thunder was\r\nheard. All trembled, and threw down their load in terror.\r\n\r\n“What can it be?” cried they. “Perhaps a signal from some vessel in\r\ndistress. Let us go to their assistance.”\r\n\r\n“It came from the vessel,” said my wife. “It must have blown up. You\r\nhave not been careful of fire; and have left some near a barrel of\r\ngunpowder.”\r\n\r\n“At all events,” said I, “we will go and ascertain the cause. Who’ll go\r\nwith me?”\r\n\r\nBy way of reply, my three sons leaped into the boat, and consoling the\r\nanxious mother by a promise to return immediately, away we rowed. We\r\nnever made the voyage so quickly. Curiosity quickened the movements of\r\nmy sons, and I was all impatience to see the result of my project. As we\r\napproached, I was glad to see no appearance of flames, or even smoke.\r\nThe position of the vessel did not seem altered. Instead of entering the\r\nvessel as usual, we rounded the prow, and came opposite the other side.\r\nThe greater part of the side of the ship was gone. The sea was covered\r\nwith the remains of it. In its place stood our beautiful pinnace, quite\r\nuninjured, only leaning a little over the stocks. At the sight I cried\r\nout, in a transport that amazed my sons, “Victory! victory! the charming\r\nvessel is our own; it will be easy now to launch her.”\r\n\r\n“Ah! I comprehend now,” said Fritz. “Papa has blown up the ship; but how\r\ncould you manage to do it so exactly?”\r\n\r\nI explained all to him, as we entered through the broken side of the\r\ndevoted vessel. I soon ascertained that no fire remained; and that the\r\npinnace had escaped any injury. We set to work to clear away all the\r\nbroken timbers in our way, and, by the aid of the jack-screw and\r\nlevers, we moved the pinnace, which we had taken care to build on\r\nrollers, to the opening; then attaching a strong cable to her head, and\r\nfixing the other end to the most solid part of the ship, we easily\r\nlaunched her. It was too late to do any more now, except carefully\r\nsecuring our prize. And we returned to the good mother, to whom, wishing\r\nto give her an agreeable surprise, we merely said, that the side of the\r\nvessel was blown out with powder; but we were still able to obtain more\r\nfrom it; at which she sighed, and, in her heart, I have no doubt, wished\r\nthe vessel, and all it contained, at the bottom of the sea.\r\n\r\nWe had two days of incessant labour in fitting and loading the pinnace;\r\nfinally, after putting up our masts, ropes, and sails, we selected a\r\ncargo of things our boats could not bring. When all was ready, my boys\r\nobtained permission, as a reward for their industry, to salute their\r\nmamma, as we entered the bay, by firing our two guns. Fritz was captain,\r\nand Ernest and Jack, at his command, put their matches to the guns, and\r\nfired. My wife and little boy rushed out in alarm; but our joyful shouts\r\nsoon re-assured them; and they were ready to welcome us with\r\nastonishment and delight. Fritz placed a plank from the pinnace to the\r\nshore, and, assisting his mother, she came on board. They gave her a new\r\nsalute, and christened the vessel _The Elizabeth_, after her.\r\n\r\nMy wife praised our skill and perseverance, but begged we would not\r\nsuppose that Francis and she had been idle during our long absence. We\r\nmoored the little fleet safely to the shore, and followed her up the\r\nriver to the cascade, where we saw a neat garden laid out in beds\r\nand walks.\r\n\r\n“This is our work,” said she; “the soil here, being chiefly composed of\r\ndecayed leaves, is light and easy to dig. There I have my potatoes;\r\nthere manioc roots: these are sown with peas, beans and lentils; in this\r\nrow of beds are sown lettuces, radishes, cabbages, and other European\r\nvegetables. I have reserved one part for sugar-canes; on the high ground\r\nI have transplanted pine-apples, and sown melons. Finally, round every\r\nbed, I have sown a border of maize, that the high, bushy stems may\r\nprotect the young plants from the sun.”\r\n\r\nI was delighted with the result of the labour and industry of a delicate\r\nfemale and a child, and could scarcely believe it was accomplished in so\r\nshort a time.\r\n\r\n“I must confess I had no great hope of success at first,” said my wife,\r\n“and this made me averse to speaking of it. Afterwards, when I suspected\r\nyou had a secret, I determined to have one, too, and give you a\r\nsurprise.”\r\n\r\nAfter again applauding these useful labours, we returned to discharge\r\nour cargo; and as we went, my good Elizabeth, still full of\r\nhorticultural plans, reminded me of the young fruit-trees we had brought\r\nfrom the vessel. I promised to look after them next day, and to\r\nestablish my orchard near her kitchen-garden.\r\n\r\nWe unloaded our vessels; placed on the sledge all that might be useful\r\nat Falcon’s Nest; and, arranging the rest under the tent, fixed our\r\npinnace to the shore, by means of the anchor and a cord fastened to a\r\nheavy stone; and at length set out to Falcon’s Nest, where we arrived\r\nsoon, to the great comfort of my wife, who dreaded the burning plain at\r\nTent House.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter our return to Falcon’s Nest, I requested my sons to continue their\r\nexercises in gymnastics. I wished to develope all the vigour and energy\r\nthat nature had given them; and which, in our situation, were especially\r\nnecessary. I added to archery, racing, leaping, wrestling, and climbing\r\ntrees, either by the trunks, or by a rope suspended from the branches,\r\nas sailors climb. I next taught them to use the _lasso_, a powerful\r\nweapon, by aid of which the people of South America capture savage\r\nanimals. I fixed two balls of lead to the ends of a cord about a fathom\r\nin length. The Patagonians, I told them, used this weapon with wonderful\r\ndexterity. Having no leaden balls, they attach a heavy stone to each end\r\nof a cord about thirty yards long. If they wish to capture an animal,\r\nthey hurl one of the stones at it with singular address. By the peculiar\r\nart with which the ball is thrown, the rope makes a turn or two round\r\nthe neck of the animal, which remains entangled, without the power of\r\nescaping. In order to show the power of this weapon, I took aim at the\r\ntrunk of a tree which they pointed out. My throw was quite successful.\r\nThe end of the rope passed two or three times round the trunk of the\r\ntree, and remained firmly fixed to it. If the tree had been the neck of\r\na tiger, I should have been absolute master of it. This experiment\r\ndecided them all to learn the use of the lasso. Fritz was soon skilful\r\nin throwing it, and I encouraged the rest to persevere in acquiring the\r\nsame facility, as the weapon might be invaluable to us when our\r\nammunition failed.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I saw, on looking out, that the sea was too much\r\nagitated for any expedition in the boats; I therefore turned to some\r\nhome employments. We looked over our stores for winter provision. My\r\nwife showed me a cask of ortolans she had preserved in butter, and a\r\nquantity of loaves of cassava bread, carefully prepared. She pointed\r\nout, that the pigeons had built in the tree, and were sitting on their\r\neggs. We then looked over the young fruit-trees brought from Europe, and\r\nmy sons and I immediately laid out a piece of ground, and planted them.\r\n\r\nThe day passed in these employments; and as we had lived only on\r\npotatoes, cassava bread, and milk for this day, we determined to go off\r\nnext morning in pursuit of game to recruit our larder. At dawn of day we\r\nall started, including little Francis and his mother, who wished to take\r\nthis opportunity of seeing a little more of the country. My sons and I\r\ntook our arms, I harnessed the ass to the sledge which contained our\r\nprovision for the day, and was destined to bring back the products of\r\nthe chase. Turk, accoutred in his coat of mail, formed the advanced\r\nguard; my sons followed with their guns; then came my wife with Francis\r\nleading the ass; and at a little distance I closed the procession, with\r\nMaster Knips mounted on the patient Flora.\r\n\r\nWe crossed Flamingo Marsh, and there my wife was charmed with the\r\nrichness of the vegetation and the lofty trees. Fritz left us, thinking\r\nthis a favourable spot for game. We soon heard the report of his gun,\r\nand an enormous bird fell a few paces from us. I ran to assist him, as\r\nhe had much difficulty in securing his prize, which was only wounded in\r\nthe wing, and was defending itself vigorously with its beak and claws. I\r\nthrew a handkerchief over its head, and, confused by the darkness, I had\r\nno difficulty in binding it, and conveying it in triumph to the sledge.\r\nWe were all in raptures at the sight of this beautiful creature, which\r\nErnest pronounced to be a female of the bustard tribe. My wife hoped\r\nthat the bird might be domesticated among her poultry, and, attracting\r\nsome more of its species, might enlarge our stock of useful fowls. We\r\nsoon arrived at the Wood of Monkeys, as we called it, where we had\r\nobtained our cocoa-nuts; and Fritz related the laughable scene of the\r\nstratagem to his mother and brothers. Ernest looked up wistfully at the\r\nnuts, but there were no monkeys to throw them down.\r\n\r\n“Do they never fall from the trees?” and hardly had he spoken, when a\r\nlarge cocoa-nut fell at his feet, succeeded by a second, to my great\r\nastonishment, for I saw no animal in the tree, and I was convinced the\r\nnuts in the half-ripe state, as these were, could not fall of\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n“It is exactly like a fairy tale,” said Ernest; “I had only to speak,\r\nand my wish was accomplished.”\r\n\r\n“And here comes the magician,” said I, as, after a shower of nuts, I saw\r\na huge land-crab descending the tree quietly, and quite regardless of\r\nour presence. Jack boldly struck a blow at him, but missed, and the\r\nanimal, opening its enormous claws, made up to its opponent, who fled in\r\nterror. But the laughter of his brothers made him ashamed, and recalling\r\nhis courage, he pulled off his coat, and threw it over the back of the\r\ncrab; this checked its movements, and going to his assistance, I killed\r\nit with a blow of my hatchet.\r\n\r\nThey all crowded round the frightful animal, anxious to know what it\r\nwas. I told them it was a land-crab—which we might call the _cocoa-nut\r\ncrab_, as we owed such a store to it. Being unable to break the shell of\r\nthe nut, of which they are very fond, they climb the tree, and break\r\nthem off, in the unripe state. They then descend to enjoy their feast,\r\nwhich they obtain by inserting their claw through the small holes in the\r\nend, and abstracting the contents. They sometimes find them broken by\r\nthe fall, when they can eat them at pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe hideousness of the animal, and the mingled terror and bravery of\r\nJack, gave us subject of conversation for some time. We placed our booty\r\non the sledge, and continued to go on through the wood. Our path became\r\nevery instant more intricate, from the amazing quantity of creeping\r\nplants which choked the way, and obliged us to use the axe continually.\r\nThe heat was excessive, and we got on slowly, when Ernest, always\r\nobserving, and who was a little behind us, cried out, “Halt! a new and\r\nimportant discovery!” We returned, and he showed us, that from the stalk\r\nof one of the creepers we had cut with our axe, there was issuing clear,\r\npure water. It was the _liane rouge_, which, in America, furnishes\r\nthe hunter such a precious resource against thirst. Ernest was much\r\npleased; he filled a cocoa-nut cup with the water, which flowed from the\r\ncut stalks like a fountain, and carried it to his mother, assuring her\r\nshe might drink fearlessly; and we all had the comfort of allaying our\r\nthirst, and blessing the Gracious Hand who has placed this refreshing\r\nplant in the midst of the dry wilderness for the benefit of man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Suddenly we saw Ernest running to us, in great terror,\r\ncrying, ‘A wild boar, papa! a great wild boar!’”]\r\n\r\nWe now marched on with more vigour, and soon arrived at the Gourd Wood,\r\nwhere my wife and younger sons beheld with wonder the growth of this\r\nremarkable fruit. Fritz repeated all the history of our former attempts,\r\nand cut some gourds to make his mother some egg-baskets, and a large\r\nspoon to cream the milk. But we first sat down under the shade, and took\r\nsome refreshment; and afterwards, while we all worked at making baskets,\r\nbowls, and flasks, Ernest, who had no taste for such labour, explored\r\nthe wood. Suddenly we saw him running to us, in great terror, crying, “A\r\nwild boar! Papa; a great wild boar!” Fritz and I seized our guns, and\r\nran to the spot he pointed out, the dogs preceding us. We soon heard\r\nbarking and loud grunting, which proved the combat had begun, and,\r\nhoping for a good prize, we hastened forward; when, what was our\r\nvexation, when we found the dogs holding by the ears, not a wild boar,\r\nbut our own great sow, whose wild and intractable disposition had\r\ninduced her to leave us, and live in the woods! We could not but laugh\r\nat our disappointment, after a while, and I made the dogs release the\r\npoor sow, who immediately resumed her feast on a small fruit, which had\r\nfallen from the trees, and, scattered on the ground, had evidently\r\ntempted the voracious beast to this part. I took up one of these apples,\r\nwhich somewhat resembled a medlar, and opening it, found the contents of\r\na rich and juicy nature, but did not venture to taste it till we had put\r\nit to the usual test. We collected a quantity—I even broke a loaded\r\nbranch from the tree, and we returned to our party. Master Knips no\r\nsooner saw them than he seized on some, and crunched them up with great\r\nenjoyment. This satisfied me that the fruit was wholesome, and we\r\nregaled ourselves with some. My wife was especially delighted when I\r\ntold her this must be the guava, from which the delicious jelly is\r\nobtained, so much prized in America.\r\n\r\n“But, with all this,” said Fritz, “we have a poor show of game. Do let\r\nus leave mamma with the young ones, and set off, to see what we can\r\nmeet with.”\r\n\r\nI consented, and we left Ernest with his mother and Francis, Jack\r\nwishing to accompany us. We made towards the rocks at the right hand,\r\nand Jack preceded us a little, when he startled us by crying out, “A\r\ncrocodile, papa!—a crocodile!”\r\n\r\n“You simpleton!” said I, “a crocodile in a place where there is not a\r\ndrop of water!”\r\n\r\n“Papa!—I see it!” said the poor child, his eyes fixed on one spot; “it\r\nis there, on this rock, sleeping. I am sure it is a crocodile!”\r\n\r\nAs soon as I was near enough to distinguish it, I assured him his\r\ncrocodile was a very harmless lizard, called the _iguana_, whose eggs\r\nand flesh were excellent food. Fritz would immediately have shot at this\r\nfrightful creature, which was about five feet in length. I showed him\r\nthat his scaly coat rendered such an attempt useless. I then cut a\r\nstrong stick and a light wand. To the end of the former I attached a\r\ncord with a noose; this I held in my right hand, keeping the wand in my\r\nleft. I approached softly, whistling. The animal awoke, apparently\r\nlistening with pleasure. I drew nearer, tickling him gently with the\r\nwand. He lifted up his head, and opened his formidable jaws. I then\r\ndexterously threw the noose round his neck, drew it, and, jumping on his\r\nback, by the aid of my sons, held him down, though he succeeded in\r\ngiving Jack a desperate blow with his tail. Then, plunging my wand up\r\nhis nostrils, a few drops of blood came, and he died apparently\r\nwithout pain.\r\n\r\nWe now carried off our game. I took him on my back, holding him by the\r\nfore-claws, while my boys carried the tail behind me; and, with shouts\r\nof laughter, the procession returned to the sledge.\r\n\r\nPoor little Francis was in great dismay when he saw the terrible monster\r\nwe brought, and began to cry; but we rallied him out of his cowardice,\r\nand his mother, satisfied with our exploits, begged to return home. As\r\nthe sledge was heavily laden, we decided to leave it till the next day,\r\nplacing on the ass, the iguana, the crab, our gourd vessels, and a bag\r\nof the guavas, little Francis being also mounted. The bustard we loosed,\r\nand, securing it by a string tied to one of its legs, led it with us.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at home in good time. My wife prepared part of the iguana for\r\nsupper, which was pronounced excellent. The crab was rejected as tough\r\nand tasteless. Our new utensils were then tried, the egg-baskets and the\r\nmilk-bowls, and Fritz was charged to dig a hole in the earth, to be\r\ncovered with boards, and serve as a dairy, till something better was\r\nthought of. Finally, we ascended our leafy abode, and slept in peace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nI projected an excursion with my eldest son, to explore the limits of\r\nour country, and satisfy ourselves that it was an island, and not a part\r\nof the continent. We set out, ostensibly, to bring the sledge we had\r\nleft the previous evening. I took Turk and the ass with us, and left\r\nFlora with my wife and children, and, with a bag of provisions, we left\r\nFalcon’s Nest as soon as breakfast was over.\r\n\r\nIn crossing a wood of oaks, covered with the sweet, eatable acorn, we\r\nagain met with the sow; our service to her in the evening did not seem\r\nto be forgotten, for she appeared tamer, and did not run from us. A\r\nlittle farther on, we saw some beautiful birds. Fritz shot some, among\r\nwhich I recognized the large blue Virginian jay, and some different\r\nkinds of parrots. As he was reloading his gun, we heard at a distance a\r\nsingular noise, like a muffled drum, mingled with the sound made in\r\nsharpening a saw. It might be savages; and we plunged into a thicket,\r\nand there discovered the cause of the noise in a brilliant green bird,\r\nseated on the withered trunk of a tree. It spread its wings and tail,\r\nand strutted about with strange contortions, to the great delight of its\r\nmates, who seemed lost in admiration of him. At the same time, he made\r\nthe sharp cry we heard, and, striking his wing against the tree,\r\nproduced the drum-like sound. I knew this to be the _ruffed grouse_, one\r\nof the greatest ornaments of the forests of America. My insatiable\r\nhunter soon put an end to the scene; he fired at the bird, who fell\r\ndead, and his crowd of admirers, with piercing cries, took to flight.\r\n\r\nI reprimanded my son for so rashly killing everything we met with\r\nwithout consideration, and for the mere love of destruction. He seemed\r\nsensible of his error, and, as the thing was done, I thought it as well\r\nto make the best of it, and sent him to pick up his game.\r\n\r\n“What a creature!” said he, as he brought it; “how it would have figured\r\nin our poultry-yard, if I had not been in such a hurry.”\r\n\r\nWe went on to our sledge in the Gourd Wood, and, as the morning was not\r\nfar advanced, we determined to leave all here, and proceed in our\r\nprojected excursion beyond the chain of rocks. But we took the ass with\r\nus to carry our provisions, and any game or other object we should meet\r\nwith in the new country we hoped to penetrate. Amongst gigantic trees,\r\nand through grass of a prodigious height, we travelled with some labour,\r\nlooking right and left to avoid danger, or to make discoveries. Turk\r\nwalked the first, smelling the air; then came the donkey, with his grave\r\nand careless step; and we followed, with our guns in readiness. We met\r\nwith plains of potatoes and of manioc, amongst the stalks of which were\r\nsporting tribes of agoutis; but we were not tempted by such game.\r\n\r\nWe now met with a new kind of bush covered with small white berries\r\nabout the size of a pea. On pressing these berries, which adhered to my\r\nfingers, I discovered that this plant was the _Myrica cerifera_, or\r\ncandle-berry myrtle, from which a wax is obtained that may be made into\r\ncandles. With great pleasure I gathered a bag of these berries, knowing\r\nhow my wife would appreciate this acquisition; for she often lamented\r\nthat we were compelled to go to bed with the birds, as soon as the\r\nsun set.\r\n\r\nWe forgot our fatigue, as we proceeded, in contemplation of the wonders\r\nof nature, flowers of marvellous beauty, butterflies of more dazzling\r\ncolours than the flowers, and birds graceful in form, and brilliant in\r\nplumage. Fritz climbed a tree, and succeeded in securing a young green\r\nparrot, which he enveloped in his handkerchief, with the intention of\r\nbringing it up, and teaching it to speak. And now we met with another\r\nwonder: a number of birds who lived in a community, in nests, sheltered\r\nby a common roof, in the formation of which they had probably laboured\r\njointly. This roof was composed of straw and dry sticks, plastered with\r\nclay, which rendered it equally impenetrable to sun or rain. Pressed as\r\nwe were for time, I could not help stopping to admire this feathered\r\ncolony. This leading us to speak of natural history, as it relates to\r\nanimals who live in societies, we recalled in succession the ingenious\r\nlabours of the beavers and the marmots; the not less marvellous\r\nconstructions of the bees, the wasps, and the ants; and I mentioned\r\nparticularly those immense ant-hills of America, of which the masonry is\r\nfinished with such skill and solidity that they are sometimes used for\r\novens, to which they bear a resemblance.\r\n\r\nWe had now reached some trees quite unknown to us. They were from forty\r\nto sixty feet in height, and from the bark, which was cracked in many\r\nplaces, issued small balls of a thick gum. Fritz got one off with\r\ndifficulty, it was so hardened by the sun. He wished to soften it with\r\nhis hands, but found that heat only gave it the power of extension, and\r\nthat by pulling the two extremities, and then releasing them, it\r\nimmediately resumed its first form.\r\n\r\nFritz ran to me, crying out, “I have found some India-rubber!”\r\n\r\n“If that be true,” said I, “you have made a most valuable discovery.”\r\n\r\nHe thought I was laughing at him, for we had no drawing to rub out here.\r\n\r\nI told him this gum might be turned to many useful purposes; among the\r\nrest we might make excellent shoes of it. This interested him. How could\r\nwe accomplish this?\r\n\r\n“The caoutchouc,” said I, “is the milky sap which is obtained from\r\ncertain trees of the _Euphorbium_ kind, by incisions made in the bark.\r\nIt is collected in vessels, care being taken to agitate them, that the\r\nliquid may not coagulate. In this state they cover little clay bottles\r\nwith successive layers of it, till it attains the required thickness. It\r\nis then dried in smoke, which gives it the dark brown colour. Before it\r\nis quite dry, it is ornamented by lines and flowers drawn with the\r\nknife. Finally, they break the clay form, and extract it from the mouth;\r\nand there remains the India-rubber bottle of commerce, soft and\r\nflexible. Now, this is my plan for shoemaking; we will fill a stocking\r\nwith sand, cover it with repeated layers of the gum till it is of the\r\nproper thickness; then empty out the sand, and, if I do not deceive\r\nmyself, we shall have perfect boots or shoes.”\r\n\r\nComfortable in the hope of new boots, we advanced through an\r\ninterminable forest of various trees. The monkeys on the cocoa-nut trees\r\nfurnished us with pleasant refreshment, and a small store of nuts\r\nbesides. Among these trees I saw some lower bushes, whose leaves were\r\ncovered with a white dust. I opened the trunk of one of these, which had\r\nbeen torn up by the wind, and found in the interior a white farinaceous\r\nsubstance, which, on tasting, I knew to be the sago imported into\r\nEurope. This, as connected with our subsistence, was a most important\r\naffair, and my son and I, with our hatchets, laid open the tree, and\r\nobtained from it twenty-five pounds of the valuable sago.\r\n\r\nThis occupied us an hour; and, weary and hungry, I thought it prudent\r\nnot to push our discoveries farther this day. We therefore returned to\r\nthe Gourd Wood, placed all our treasures on the sledge, and took our way\r\nhome. We arrived without more adventures, and were warmly greeted, and\r\nour various offerings gratefully welcomed, especially the green parrot.\r\nWe talked of the caoutchouc, and new boots, with great delight during\r\nsupper; and, afterwards, my wife looked with exceeding content at her\r\nbag of candle-berries, anticipating the time when we should not have to\r\ngo to bed, as we did now, as soon as the sun set.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning my wife and children besought me to begin my\r\nmanufacture of candles. I remembered having seen the chandler at work,\r\nand I tried to recall all my remembrances of the process. I put into a\r\nboiler as many berries as it would hold, and placed it over a moderate\r\nfire: the wax melted from the berries, and rose to the surface, and this\r\nI carefully skimmed with a large flat spoon and put in a separate vessel\r\nplaced near the fire; when this was done, my wife supplied me with some\r\nwicks she had made from the threads of sailcloth; these wicks were\r\nattached, four at a time, to a small stick; I dipped them into the wax,\r\nand placed them on two branches of a tree to dry; I repeated this\r\noperation as often as necessary to make them the proper thickness, and\r\nthen placed them in a cool spot to harden. But we could not forbear\r\ntrying them that very night; and, thought somewhat rude in form, it was\r\nsufficient that they reminded us of our European home, and prolonged our\r\ndays by many useful hours we had lost before.\r\n\r\nThis encouraged me to attempt another enterprise. My wife had long\r\nregretted that she had not been able to make butter. She had attempted\r\nto beat her cream in a vessel, but either the heat of the climate, or\r\nher want of patience, rendered her trials unsuccessful. I felt that I\r\nhad not skill enough to make a churn; but I fancied that by some simple\r\nmethod, like that used by the Hottentots, who put their cream in a skin\r\nand shake it till they produce butter, we might obtain the same result.\r\nI cut a large gourd in two, filled it with three quarts of cream, then\r\nunited the parts, and secured them closely. I fastened a stick to each\r\ncorner of a square piece of sailcloth, placed the gourd in the middle,\r\nand, giving a corner to each of my sons, directed them to rock the cloth\r\nwith a slow, regular motion, as you would a child’s cradle. This was\r\nquite an amusement for them; and at the end of an hour, my wife had the\r\npleasure of placing before us some excellent butter. I then tried to\r\nmake a cart, our sledge being unfitted for some roads; the wheels I had\r\nbrought from the wreck rendered this less difficult; and I completed a\r\nvery rude vehicle, which was, nevertheless, very useful to us.\r\n\r\nWhile I was thus usefully employed, my wife and children were not idle.\r\nThey had transplanted the European trees, and thoughtfully placed each\r\nin the situation best suited to it. I assisted with my hands and\r\ncounsels. The vines we planted round the roots of our trees, and hoped\r\nin time to form a trellis-work. Of the chesnut, walnut, and\r\ncherry-trees, we formed an avenue from Falcon’s Nest to Family Bridge,\r\nwhich, we hoped, would ultimately be a shady road between our two\r\nmansions. We made a solid road between the two rows of trees, raised in\r\nthe middle and covered with sand, which we brought from the shore in our\r\nwheelbarrows. I also made a sort of tumbril, to which we harnessed the\r\nass, to lighten this difficult labour.\r\n\r\nWe then turned our thoughts to Tent House, our first abode, and which\r\nstill might form our refuge in case of danger. Nature had not favoured\r\nit; but our labour soon supplied all deficiencies. We planted round it\r\nevery tree that requires ardent heat; the citron, pistachio, the almond,\r\nthe mulberry, the Siamese orange, of which the fruit is as large as the\r\nhead of a child, and the Indian fig, with its long prickly leaves, all\r\nhad a place here. These plantations succeeding admirably, we had, after\r\nsome time, the pleasure of seeing the dry and sandy desert converted\r\ninto a shady grove, rich in flowers and fruit. As this place was the\r\nmagazine for our arms, ammunition, and provisions of all sorts; we made\r\na sort of fortress of it, surrounding it with a high hedge of strong,\r\nthorny trees; so that not only to wild beasts, but even to human\r\nenemies, it was inaccessible. Our bridge was the only point of approach,\r\nand we always carefully removed the first planks after crossing it. We\r\nalso placed our two cannon on a little elevation within the enclosure;\r\nand, finally, we planted some cedars, near our usual landing-place, to\r\nwhich we might, at a future time, fasten our vessels. These labours\r\noccupied us three months, only interrupted by a strict attention to the\r\ndevotions and duties of the Sunday. I was most especially grateful to\r\nGod for the robust health we all enjoyed, in the midst of our\r\nemployments. All went on well in our little colony. We had an abundant\r\nand certain supply of provisions; but our wardrobe, notwithstanding the\r\ncontinual repairing my wife bestowed on it, was in a most wretched\r\nstate, and we had no means of renewing it, except by again visiting the\r\nwreck, which I knew still contained some chests of clothes, and bales\r\nof cloth. This decided me to make another voyage; besides I was rather\r\nanxious to see the state of the vessel.\r\n\r\nWe found it much in the same condition we had left it, except being much\r\nmore shattered by the winds and waves.\r\n\r\nWe selected many useful things for our cargo; the bales of linen and\r\nwoollen cloth were not forgotten; some barrels of tar; and everything\r\nportable that we could remove; doors, windows, tables, benches, locks\r\nand bolts, all the ammunition, and even such of the guns as we could\r\nmove. In fact we completely sacked the vessel; carrying off, after\r\nseveral days’ labour, all our booty, with the exception of some weighty\r\narticles, amongst which were three or four immense boilers, intended for\r\na sugar-manufactory. These we tied to some large empty casks, which we\r\npitched completely over, and hoped they would be able to float in\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nWhen we had completed our arrangements, I resolved to blow up the ship.\r\nWe placed a large barrel of gunpowder in the hold, and arranging a long\r\nmatch from it, which would burn some hours, we lighted it, and proceeded\r\nwithout delay to Safety Bay to watch the event. I proposed to my wife to\r\nsup on a point of land where we could distinctly see the vessel. Just as\r\nthe sun was going down, a majestic rolling, like thunder, succeeded by a\r\ncolumn of fire, announced the destruction of the vessel, which had\r\nbrought us from Europe, and bestowed its great riches on us. We could\r\nnot help shedding tears, as we heard the last mournful cry of this sole\r\nremaining bond that connected us with home. We returned sorrowfully to\r\nTent House, and felt as if we had lost an old friend.\r\n\r\nWe rose early next morning, and hastened to the shore, which we found\r\ncovered with the wreck, which, with a little exertion, we found it easy\r\nto collect. Amongst the rest, were the large boilers. We afterwards used\r\nthese to cover our barrels of gunpowder, which we placed in a part of\r\nthe rock, where, even if an explosion took place, no damage could ensue.\r\n\r\nMy wife, in assisting us with the wreck, made the agreeable discovery,\r\nthat two of our ducks, and one goose, had hatched each a brood, and were\r\nleading their noisy young families to the water. This reminded us of all\r\nour poultry and domestic comfort, at Falcon’s Nest, and we determined to\r\ndefer, for some time, the rest of our work at Tent House, and to return\r\nthe next day to our shady summer home.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we went along the avenue of fruit-trees, I was concerned to see my\r\nyoung plants beginning to droop, and I immediately resolved to proceed\r\nto Cape Disappointment the next morning, to cut bamboos to make props\r\nfor them. It was determined we should all go, as, on our arrival at\r\nFalcon’s Nest, we discovered many other supplies wanting. The candles\r\nwere failing: we must have more berries, for now my wife sewed by\r\ncandlelight, while I wrote my journal. She wanted, also, some\r\nwild-fowls’ eggs to set under her hens. Jack wanted some guavas, and\r\nFrancis wished for some sugar-canes. So we made a family tour of it,\r\ntaking the cart, with the cow and ass, to contain our provision, and a\r\nlarge sailcloth, to make a tent. The weather was delightful, and we set\r\nout singing, in great spirits.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the potato and manioc plantations, and the wood of guavas, on\r\nwhich my boys feasted to their great satisfaction. The road was rugged,\r\nbut we assisted to move the cart, and rested frequently. We stopped to\r\nsee the bird colony, which greatly delighted them all, and Ernest\r\ndeclared they belonged to the species of _Loxia gregaria_, the sociable\r\ngrosbeak. He pointed out to us their wonderful instinct in forming their\r\ncolony in the midst of the candle-berry bushes, on which they feed. We\r\nfilled two bags with these berries, and another with guavas, my wife\r\nproposing to make jelly from them.\r\n\r\nWe then proceeded to the caoutchouc-tree, and here I determined to rest\r\nawhile, to collect some of the valuable gum. I had brought some large\r\ngourd-shells with me for the purpose. I made incisions in the trees, and\r\nplaced these bowls to receive the gum, which soon began to run out in a\r\nmilky stream, and we hoped to find them filled on our return. We turned\r\na little to the left, and entered a beautiful and fertile plain, bounded\r\non one side by the sugar-canes, behind which rose a wood of palms, on\r\nthe other by the bamboos; and before us was Cape Disappointment, backed\r\nby the ocean—a magnificent picture.\r\n\r\nWe at once decided to make this our resting-place; we even thought of\r\ntransferring our residence from Falcon’s Nest to this spot; but we\r\ndismissed the thought, when we reflected on the perfect security of our\r\ndear castle in the air. We contented ourselves with arranging to make\r\nthis always our station for refreshment in our excursions. We loosed our\r\nanimals, and allowed them to graze on the rich grass around us. We\r\narranged to spend the night here, and, taking a light repast, we\r\nseparated on our several employments—some to cut sugar-canes, others\r\nbamboos, and, after stripping them, to make them into bundles, and place\r\nthem in the cart. This hard work made the boys hungry; they refreshed\r\nthemselves with sugar-canes, but had a great desire to have some\r\ncocoa-nuts. Unfortunately, there were neither monkeys nor crabs to\r\nbestow them, and the many attempts they made to climb the lofty, bare\r\ntrunk of the palm ended only in disappointment and confusion. I went to\r\ntheir assistance. I gave them pieces of the rough skin of the shark,\r\nwhich I had brought for the purpose, to brace on their legs, and showing\r\nthem how to climb, by the aid of a cord fastened round the tree with a\r\nrunning noose, a method practised with success by the savages, my little\r\nclimbers soon reached the summit of the trees; they then used their\r\nhatchets, which they had carried up in their girdles, and a shower of\r\ncocoa-nuts fell down. These furnished a pleasant dessert, enlivened by\r\nthe jests of Fritz and Jack, who, being the climbers, did not spare\r\nDoctor Ernest, who had contented himself with looking up at them; and\r\neven now, regardless of their banter, he was lost in some new idea.\r\nRising suddenly, and looking at the palms, he took a cocoa-nut cup, and\r\na tin flask with a handle, and gravely addressed us thus:—\r\n\r\n“Gentlemen and lady! this exercise of climbing is really very\r\ndisagreeable and difficult; but since it confers so much honour on the\r\nundertakers, I should like also to attempt an adventure, hoping to do\r\nsomething at once glorious and agreeable to the company.”\r\n\r\nHe then bound his legs with the pieces of shark’s skin, and with\r\nsingular vigour and agility sprung up a palm which he had long been\r\nattentively examining. His brothers laughed loudly at his taking the\r\ntrouble to ascend a tree that had not a single nut on it. Ernest took no\r\nnotice of their ridicule, but, as soon as he reached the top, struck\r\nwith his hatchet, and a tuft of tender yellow leaves fell at our feet,\r\nwhich I recognized as the product of the cabbage-palm, a delicate food,\r\nhighly valued in America. His mother thought it a mischievous act, to\r\ndestroy the tree thus; but he assured her his prize was worth many\r\ncocoa-nuts. But our hero did not descend; and I asked him if he wanted\r\nto replace the cabbage he had cut off?\r\n\r\n“Wait a little,” said he; “I am bringing you some wine to drink my\r\nhealth; but it comes slower than I could wish.”\r\n\r\nHe now descended, holding his cocoa-cup, into which he poured from the\r\nflask a clear rose-coloured liquor, and, presenting it to me, begged me\r\nto drink. It was, indeed, the true palm-wine, which is as pleasant as\r\nchampaign, and, taken moderately, a great restorative.\r\n\r\nWe all drank; and Ernest was praised and thanked by all, till he forgot\r\nall the scoffs he had received.\r\n\r\nAs it was getting late, we set about putting up our tent for the night,\r\nwhen suddenly our ass, who had been quietly grazing near us, began to\r\nbray furiously, erected his ears, kicking right and left, and, plunging\r\ninto the bamboos, disappeared. This made us very uneasy. I could not\r\nsubmit to lose the useful animal; and, moreover, I was afraid his\r\nagitation announced the approach of some wild beast. The dogs and I\r\nsought for any trace of it in vain; I therefore, to guard against any\r\ndanger, made a large fire before our tent, which I continued to watch\r\ntill midnight, when, all being still, I crept into the tent, to my bed\r\nof moss, and slept undisturbed till morning.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we thanked God for our health and safety, and then began\r\nto lament our poor donkey, which, I hoped, might have been attracted by\r\nthe light of our fire, and have returned; but we saw nothing of him, and\r\nwe decided that his services were so indispensable, that I should go,\r\nwith one of my sons, and the two dogs, in search of him, and cross the\r\nthickets of bamboo. I chose to take Jack with me, to his great\r\nsatisfaction, for Fritz and Ernest formed a better guard for their\r\nmother in a strange place. We set out, well armed, with bags of\r\nprovisions on our back, and after an hour’s fruitless search among the\r\ncanes, We emerged beyond them, in an extensive plain on the borders of\r\nthe great bay. We saw that the ridge of rocks still extended on the\r\nright till it nearly reached the shore, when it abruptly terminated in a\r\nperpendicular precipice. A considerable river flowed into the bay here,\r\nand between the river and the rock was a narrow passage, which at high\r\nwater would be overflowed. We thought it most likely that our ass had\r\npassed by this defile; and I wished to see whether these rocks merely\r\nbordered or divided the island; we therefore went forward till we met\r\nwith a stream, which fell in a cascade from a mass of rocks into the\r\nriver. We ascended the stream till we found a place shallow enough to\r\ncross. Here we saw the shoe-marks of our ass, mingled with the footsteps\r\nof other animals, and at a distance we saw a herd of animals, but could\r\nnot distinguish what they were. We ascended a little hill, and, through\r\nour telescope, saw a most beautiful and fertile country, breathing peace\r\nand repose. To our right rose the majestic chain of rocks that divided\r\nthe island. On our left a succession of beautiful green hills spread to\r\nthe horizon. Woods of palms and various unknown trees were scattered\r\nover the scene. The beautiful stream meandered across the valley like a\r\nsilver ribbon, bordered by rushes and other aquatic plants. There was no\r\ntrace of the footstep of man. The country had all the purity of its\r\nfirst creation; no living creatures but some beautiful birds and\r\nbrilliant butterflies appeared.\r\n\r\nBut, at a distance, we saw some specks, which I concluded were the\r\nanimals we had first seen, and I resolved to go nearer, in hopes our ass\r\nmight have joined them. We made towards the spot, and, to shorten the\r\nroad, crossed a little wood of bamboos, the stalks of which, as thick as\r\na man’s thigh, rose to the height of thirty feet. I suspected this to be\r\nthe giant reed of America, so useful for the masts of boats and canoes.\r\nI promised Jack to allow him to cut some on our return; but at present\r\nthe ass was my sole care. When we had crossed the wood, we suddenly came\r\nface to face on a herd of buffaloes, not numerous certainly, but\r\nformidable in appearance. At the sight, I was absolutely petrified, and\r\nmy gun useless. Fortunately the dogs were in the rear, and the animals,\r\nlifting their heads, and fixing their large eyes on us, seemed more\r\nastonished than angry—we were the first men probably they had\r\never seen.\r\n\r\nWe drew back a little, prepared our arms, and endeavoured to retreat,\r\nwhen the dogs arrived, and, notwithstanding our efforts to restrain\r\nthem, flew at the buffaloes. It was no time now to retreat; the combat\r\nwas begun. The whole troop uttered the most frightful roars, beat the\r\nground with their feet, and butted with their horns. Our brave dogs were\r\nnot intimidated, but marched straight upon the enemy, and, falling on a\r\nyoung buffalo that had strayed before the rest, seized it by the ears.\r\nThe creature began to bellow, and struggle to escape; its mother ran to\r\nits assistance, and, with her, the whole herd. At that moment,—I\r\ntremble as I write it, I gave the signal to my brave Jack, who behaved\r\nwith admirable coolness, and at the same moment we fired on the herd.\r\nThe effect was wonderful: they paused a moment, and then, even before\r\nthe smoke was dissipated, took to flight with incredible rapidity,\r\nforded the river, and were soon out of sight. My dogs still held their\r\nprize, and the mother, though wounded by our shot, tore up the ground in\r\nher fury, and was advancing on the dogs to destroy them; but I stepped\r\nforward, and discharging a pistol between the horns, put an end to\r\nher life.\r\n\r\nWe began to breathe. We had looked death in the face,—a most horrible\r\ndeath; and thanked God for our preservation. I praised Jack for his\r\ncourage and presence of mind; any fear or agitation on his part would\r\nhave unnerved me, and rendered our fate certain. The dogs still held the\r\nyoung calf by the ears, it bellowed incessantly, and I feared they would\r\neither be injured or lose their prize. I went up to their assistance. I\r\nhardly knew how to act. I could easily have killed it; but I had a great\r\ndesire to carry it off alive, and try to tame it, to replace our ass,\r\nwhom I did not intend to follow farther. A happy idea struck Jack: he\r\nalways carried his lasso in his pocket; he drew it out, retired a\r\nlittle, and flung it so dexterously that he completely wound it round\r\nthe hind legs of the calf, and threw it down. I now approached; I\r\nreplaced the lasso by a stronger cord, and used another to bind his fore\r\nlegs loosely. Jack cried victory, and already thought how his mother and\r\nbrothers would be delighted, when we presented it; but that was no easy\r\nmatter. At last I thought of the method used in Italy to tame the wild\r\nbulls, and I resolved to try it, though it was a little cruel.\r\n\r\nI began by tying to the foot of a tree the cords that held the legs;\r\nthen making the dogs seize him again by the ears, I caught hold of his\r\nmouth, and with a sharp knife perforated the nostril, and quickly passed\r\na cord through the opening. This cord was to serve as my rein, to guide\r\nthe animal. The operation was successful; and, as soon as the blood\r\nceased to flow, I took the cord, uniting the two ends, and the poor\r\nsuffering creature, completely subdued, followed me without resistance.\r\n\r\nI was unwilling to abandon the whole of the buffalo I had killed, as it\r\nis excellent meat; I therefore cut out the tongue, and some of the best\r\nparts from the loin, and covered them well with salt, of which we had\r\ntaken a provision with us. I then carefully skinned the four legs,\r\nremembering that the American hunters use these skins for boots, being\r\nremarkably soft and flexible. We permitted the dogs to feast on the\r\nremainder; and while they were enjoying themselves, we washed ourselves,\r\nand sat down under a tree to rest and refresh ourselves. But the poor\r\nbeasts had soon many guests at their banquet. Clouds of birds of prey\r\ncame from every part; an incessant combat was kept up; no sooner was one\r\ntroop of brigands satisfied, than another succeeded; and soon all that\r\nremained of the poor buffalo was the bones. I noticed amongst these\r\nravenous birds the royal vulture, an elegant bird, remarkable for a\r\nbrilliant collar of down. We could easily have killed some of these\r\nrobbers, but I thought it useless to destroy for mere curiosity, and I\r\npreferred employing our time in cutting, with a small saw we had\r\nbrought, some of the gigantic reeds that grew round us. We cut several\r\nof the very thick ones, which make excellent vessels when separated at\r\nthe joints; but I perceived that Jack was cutting some of small\r\ndimensions, and I inquired if he was going to make a Pandean pipe, to\r\ncelebrate his triumphal return with the buffalo.\r\n\r\n“No,” said he; “I don’t recollect that Robinson Crusoe amused himself\r\nwith music in his island; but I have thought of something that will be\r\nuseful to mamma. I am cutting these reeds to make moulds for\r\nour candles.”\r\n\r\n“An excellent thought, my dear boy!” said I; “and if even we break our\r\nmoulds in getting out the candles, which I suspect we may, we know where\r\nthey grow, and can come for more.”\r\n\r\nWe collected all our reeds in bundles, and then set out. The calf,\r\nintimidated by the dogs, and galled by the rein, went on tolerably well.\r\nWe crossed the narrow pass in the rocks, and here our dogs killed a\r\nlarge jackal which was coming from her den in the rock. The furious\r\nanimals then entered the den, followed by Jack, who saved, with\r\ndifficulty, one of the young cubs, the others being immediately worried.\r\nIt was a pretty little gold-coloured creature, about the size of a cat.\r\nJack petitioned earnestly to have it to bring up; and I made him happy\r\nby granting his request.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time I had tied the calf to a low tree, which I discovered\r\nwas the thorny dwarf palm, which grows quickly, and is extremely useful\r\nfor fences. It bears an oblong fruit, about the size of a pigeon’s egg,\r\nfrom which is extracted an oil which is an excellent substitute for\r\nbutter. I determined to return for some young plants of this palm to\r\nplant at Tent House.\r\n\r\nIt was almost night when we joined our family; and endless were the\r\nquestions the sight of the buffalo produced, and great was the boasting\r\nof Jack the dauntless. I was compelled to lower his pride a little by an\r\nunvarnished statement, though I gave him much credit for his coolness\r\nand resolution; and, supper-time arriving, my wife had time to tell me\r\nwhat had passed while we had been on our expedition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy wife began by saying they had not been idle in my absence. They had\r\ncollected wood, and made torches for the night. Fritz and Ernest had\r\neven cut down an immense sago-palm, seventy feet high, intending to\r\nextract its precious pith; but this they had been unable to accomplish\r\nalone, and waited for my assistance. But while they were engaged in this\r\nemployment, a troop of monkeys had broken into the tent and pillaged and\r\ndestroyed everything; they had drunk or overturned the milk, and carried\r\noff or spoiled all our provisions; and even so much injured the palisade\r\nI had erected round the tent, that it took them an hour, after they\r\nreturned, to repair the damage. Fritz had made also a beautiful capture,\r\nin a nest he had discovered in the rocks at Cape Disappointment. It was\r\na superb bird, and, though very young, quite feathered. Ernest had\r\npronounced it to be the eagle of Malabar, and I confirmed his assertion;\r\nand as this species of eagle is not large, and does not require much\r\nfood, I advised him to train it as a falcon, to chase other birds. I\r\ntook this opportunity to announce that henceforward every one must\r\nattend to his own live stock, or they should be set at liberty, mamma\r\nhaving sufficient to manage in her own charge.\r\n\r\nWe then made a fire of green wood, in the smoke of which we placed the\r\nbuffalo-meat we had brought home, leaving it during the night, that it\r\nmight be perfectly cured. We had had some for supper, and thought it\r\nexcellent. The young buffalo was beginning to graze, and we gave him a\r\nlittle milk to-night, as well as to the jackal. Fritz had taken the\r\nprecaution to cover the eyes of his eagle, and tying it fast by the leg\r\nto a branch, it rested very tranquilly. We then retired to our mossy\r\nbeds, to recruit our strength for the labours of another day.\r\n\r\nAt break of day we rose, made a light breakfast, and I was about to give\r\nthe signal of departure, when my wife communicated to me the difficulty\r\nthey had had in cutting down the palm-tree, and the valuable provision\r\nthat might be obtained from it with a little trouble. I thought she was\r\nright, and decided to remain here another day; for it was no trifling\r\nundertaking to split up a tree seventy feet long. I consented the more\r\nreadily, as I thought I might, after removing the useful pith from the\r\ntrunk, obtain two large spouts or channels to conduct the water from\r\nJackal River to the kitchen-garden.\r\n\r\nSuch tools as we had we carried to the place where the tree lay. We\r\nfirst sawed off the head; then, with the hatchet making an opening at\r\neach end, we took wedges and mallets, and the wood being tolerably soft,\r\nafter four hours’ labour, we succeeded in splitting it completely. When\r\nparted, we pressed the pith with our hands, to get the whole into one\r\ndivision of the trunk, and began to make our paste. At one end of the\r\nspout we nailed one of the graters, through which we intended to force\r\nthe paste, to form the round seeds. My little bakers set vigorously to\r\nwork, some pouring water on the pith, while the rest mixed it into\r\npaste. When sufficiently worked, I pressed it strongly with my hand\r\nagainst the grater; the farinaceous parts passed easily through the\r\nholes, while the _ligneous_ part, consisting of splinters of wood, &c.,\r\nwas left behind. This we threw into a heap, hoping mushrooms might\r\nspring from it. My wife now carefully spread the grains on sailcloth, in\r\nthe sun, to dry them. I also formed some vermicelli, by giving more\r\nconsistence to the paste, and forcing it through the holes in little\r\npipes. My wife promised with this, and the Dutch cheese, to make us a\r\ndish equal to Naples maccaroni. We were now contented; we could at any\r\ntime obtain more sago by cutting down a tree, and we were anxious to get\r\nhome to try our water-pipes. We spent the rest of the day in loading the\r\ncart with our utensils and the halves of the tree. We retired to our hut\r\nat sunset, and slept in peace.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the whole caravan began to move at an early hour. The\r\nbuffalo, harnessed to the cart, by the side of his nurse, the cow, took\r\nthe place of our lost ass, and began his apprenticeship as a beast of\r\ndraught. We took the same road on our return, that we might carry away\r\nthe candle-berries and the vessels of India-rubber. The vanguard was\r\ncomposed of Fritz and Jack, who pioneered our way, by cutting down the\r\nunderwood to make a road for the cart. Our water-pipes, being very long,\r\nsomewhat impeded our progress; but we happily reached the candle-berry\r\ntrees without accident, and placed our sacks on the cart. We did not\r\nfind more than a quart of the caoutchouc gum; but it would be\r\nsufficient for our first experiment, and I carried it off.\r\n\r\nIn crossing the little wood of guavas, we suddenly heard our dogs, who\r\nwere before us with Fritz and Jack, uttering the most frightful\r\nhowlings. I was struck with terror lest they should have encountered a\r\ntiger, and rushed forward ready to fire. The dogs were endeavouring to\r\nenter a thicket, in the midst of which Fritz declared he had caught a\r\nglimpse of an animal larger than the buffalo, with a black, bristly\r\nskin. I was just about to discharge my gun into the thicket, when Jack,\r\nwho had lain down on the ground, to look under the bushes, burst into a\r\nloud laugh. “It is another trick of that vexatious animal, our old sow!\r\nshe is always making fools of us,” cried he. Half merry and half angry,\r\nwe made an opening into the thicket, and there discovered the lady\r\nlying, surrounded by seven little pigs, only a few days old. We were\r\nvery glad to see our old friend so attended, and stroked her. She seemed\r\nto recognize us, and grunted amicably. We supplied her with some\r\npotatoes, sweet acorns, and cassava bread; intending, in return, to eat\r\nher young ones, when they were ready for the spit, though my dear wife\r\ncried out against the cruelty of the idea. At present we left them with\r\nher, but proposed afterwards to take away two, to be brought up at home,\r\nand leave the rest to support themselves on acorns in the woods, where\r\nthey would become game for us. At length we arrived at Falcon’s Nest,\r\nwhich we regarded with all the attachment of home. Our domestic animals\r\ncrowded round us, and noisily welcomed us. We tied up the buffalo and\r\njackal, as they were not yet domesticated. Fritz fastened his eagle to\r\na branch by a chain long enough to allow it to move freely, and then\r\nimprudently uncovered its eyes; it immediately raised its head, erected\r\nits feathers, and struck on all sides with its beak and claws; our fowls\r\ntook to flight, but the poor parrot fell in his way, and was torn to\r\npieces before we could assist it. Fritz was very angry, and would have\r\nexecuted the murderer; but Ernest begged he would not be so rash, as\r\nparrots were more plentiful than eagles, and it was his own fault for\r\nuncovering his eyes; the falconers always keeping their young birds\r\nhooded six weeks, till they are quite tamed. He offered to train it, if\r\nFritz would part with it; but this Fritz indignantly refused. I told\r\nthem the fable of the dog in the manger, which abashed Fritz; and he\r\nthen besought his brother to teach him the means of training this noble\r\nbird, and promised to present him with his monkey.\r\n\r\nErnest then told him that the Caribs subdue the largest birds by making\r\nthem inhale tobacco smoke. Fritz laughed at this; but Ernest brought a\r\npipe and some tobacco he had found in the ship, and began to smoke\r\ngravely under the branch where the bird was perched. It was soon calm,\r\nand on his continuing to smoke it became quite motionless. Fritz then\r\neasily replaced the bandage, and thanked his brother for his\r\ngood service.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we set out early to our young plantation of\r\nfruit-trees, to fix props to support the weaker plants. We loaded the\r\ncart with the thick bamboo canes and our tools, and harnessed the cow to\r\nit, leaving the buffalo in the stable, as I wished the wound in his\r\nnostrils to be perfectly healed before I put him to any hard work. I\r\nleft Francis with his mother, to prepare our dinner, begging them not to\r\nforget the maccaroni.\r\n\r\nWe began at the entrance of the avenue to Falcon’s Nest, where all the\r\ntrees were much bent by the wind. We raised them gently by a crowbar; I\r\nmade a hole in the earth, in which one of my sons placed the bamboo\r\nprops, driving them firmly down with a mallet, and we proceeded to\r\nanother, while Ernest and Jack tied the trees to them with a long,\r\ntough, pliant plant, which I suspected was a species of _llana_. As we\r\nwere working, Fritz inquired if these fruit-trees were wild.\r\n\r\n“A pretty question!” cried Jack. “Do you think that trees are tamed like\r\neagles or buffaloes? You perhaps could teach them to bow politely, so\r\nthat we might gather the fruit!”\r\n\r\n“You fancy you are a wit,” said I, “but you speak like a dunce. We\r\ncannot make trees bow at our pleasure; but we can make a tree, which by\r\nnature bears sour and uneatable fruit, produce what is sweet and\r\nwholesome. This is effected by grafting into a wild tree a small branch,\r\nor even a bud, of the sort you wish. I will show you this method\r\npractically at some future time, for by these means we can procure all\r\nsorts of fruit; only we must remember, that we can only graft a tree\r\nwith one of the same natural family; thus, we could not graft an apple\r\non a cherry-tree, for one belongs to the apple tribe, and the other to\r\nthe plum tribe.”\r\n\r\n“Do we know the origin of all these European fruits?” asked the\r\ninquiring Ernest.\r\n\r\n“All our shell fruits,” answered I, “such as the nut, the almond, and\r\nthe chesnut, are natives of the East; the peach, of Persia; the orange\r\nand apricot, of Armenia; the cherry, which was unknown in Europe sixty\r\nyears before Christ, was brought by the proconsul Lucullus from the\r\nsouthern shores of the Euxine; the olives come from Palestine. The first\r\nolive-trees were planted on Mount Olympus, and from thence were spread\r\nthrough the rest of Europe; the fig is from Lydia; the plums, your\r\nfavourite fruit, with the exception of some natural sorts that are\r\nnatives of our forests, are from Syria, and the town of Damascus has\r\ngiven its name to one sort, the _Damascene_, or Damson. The pear is a\r\nfruit of Greece; the ancients called it the fruit of Peloponnesus; the\r\nmulberry is from Asia; and the quince from the island of Crete.”\r\n\r\nOur work progressed as we talked thus, and we had soon propped all our\r\nvaluable plants. It was now noon, and we returned to Falcon’s Nest very\r\nhungry, and found an excellent dinner prepared, of smoked beef, and the\r\ntender bud of the cabbage-palm, the most delicious of vegetables.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, we began to discuss a plan I had long had in my head; but\r\nthe execution of it presented many difficulties. It was, to substitute a\r\nfirm and solid staircase for the ladder of ropes, which was a source of\r\ncontinual fear to my wife. It is true, that we only had to ascend it to\r\ngo to bed; but bad weather might compel us to remain in our apartment;\r\nwe should then have frequently to ascend and descend, and the ladder was\r\nvery unsafe. But the immense height of the tree, and the impossibility\r\nof procuring beams to sustain a staircase round it, threw me into\r\ndespair. However, looking at the monstrous trunk of the tree, I\r\nthought, if we cannot succeed outside, could we not contrive to mount\r\nwithin?\r\n\r\n“Have you not said there was a swarm of bees in the trunk of the tree?”\r\nI inquired of my wife. “Yes,” said little Francis, “they stung my face\r\ndreadfully the other day, when I was on the ladder. I was pushing a\r\nstick into the hole they came out of, to try how deep it was.”\r\n\r\n“Now, then,” cried I, “I see through my difficulties. Let us find out\r\nhow far the tree is hollow; we can increase the size of the tunnel, and\r\nI have already planned the sort of staircase I can construct.” I had\r\nhardly spoken, when the boys leaped like squirrels, some upon the arched\r\nroots, some on the steps of the ladder, and began to strike with sticks\r\nand mallets to sound the tree. This rash proceeding had nearly been\r\nfatal to Jack, who, having placed himself just before the opening, and\r\nstriking violently, the whole swarm, alarmed at an attack, which\r\nprobably shook their palace of wax, issued forth, and revenged\r\nthemselves amply on all the assailants. Nothing was heard but cries and\r\nstamping of feet. My wife hastened to cover the stings with moist earth,\r\nwhich rather relieved them; but it was some hours before they could open\r\ntheir eyes. They begged me to get them the honey from their foes, and I\r\nprepared a hive, which I had long thought of—a large gourd, which I\r\nplaced on a board nailed upon a branch of our tree, and covered with\r\nstraw to shelter it from the sun and wind. But it was now bedtime, and\r\nwe deferred our attack on the fortress till next day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn hour before day, I waked my sons to assist me in removing the bees to\r\nthe new abode I had prepared for them. I commenced by plastering up the\r\nentrance to their present dwelling with clay, leaving only room to admit\r\nthe bowl of my pipe. This was necessary, because I had neither masks nor\r\ngloves, as the regular bee-takers have. I then began to smoke briskly,\r\nto stupify the bees. At first we heard a great buzzing in the hollow,\r\nlike the sound of a distant storm: the murmur ceased by degrees, and a\r\nprofound stillness succeeded, and I withdrew my pipe without a single\r\nbee appearing. Fritz and I then, with a chisel and small axe, made an\r\nopening about three feet square, below the bees’ entrance. Before we\r\ndetached this, I repeated the fumigation, lest the noise and the fresh\r\nair should awake the bees; but there was no fear of such a thing,—they\r\nwere quite stupified. We removed the wood, and through this opening\r\nbeheld, with wonder and admiration, the work of this insect nation.\r\nThere was such a store of wax and honey, that we feared we should not\r\nhave vessels to contain it. The interior of the tree was filled with the\r\nhoneycombs; I cut them carefully, and placed them in the gourds the boys\r\nbrought me. As soon as I had made a little space, I placed the upper\r\ncomb, on which the bees were hanging in clusters, in the new hive, and\r\nput it on the plank prepared for it; I then descended with the rest of\r\nthe honeycomb, and filled a cask with it, which I had previously washed\r\nin the stream; this we covered with sailcloth and planks, lest the\r\nbees, attracted by the smell, should come to claim their own. We left\r\nout some comb for a treat at dinner, and my wife carefully put by\r\nthe rest.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the bees returning to their old abode, we placed some burning\r\ntobacco in the hollow, the smell and fumes of which drove them from the\r\ntree, when they wished to enter; and, finally, they settled in the new\r\nhive, where the queen bee, doubtless, had fixed herself.\r\n\r\nWe now began our work; we emptied the cask of honey into a large boiler,\r\nexcept a little reserved for daily use; we added a little water, placed\r\nthe boiler on a slow fire, and reduced it to a liquid mass; this was\r\nstrained through a bag into the cask, and left standing all night to\r\ncool. The next morning the wax had risen to the top, and formed a hard\r\nand solid cake, which we easily removed; and beneath was the most pure\r\nand delicious honey. The barrel was then carefully closed, and placed in\r\na cool place. We now proceeded to examine the interior of the tree. I\r\ntook a long pole, and tried the height from the window I had made; and\r\ntied a stone to a string to sound the depth. To my surprise, the pole\r\npenetrated without resistance to the very branches where our dwelling\r\nwas, and the stone went to the roots. It was entirely hollow, and I\r\nthought I could easily fix a winding staircase in this wide tunnel. It\r\nwould seem, that this huge tree, like the willow of our country, is\r\nnourished through the bark, for it was flourishing in luxuriant beauty.\r\n\r\nWe began by cutting a doorway, on the side facing the sea, of the size\r\nof the door we had brought from the captain’s cabin, with its\r\nframework, thus securing ourselves from invasion on that side. We then\r\ncleansed, and perfectly smoothed the cavity, fixing in the middle the\r\ntrunk of a tree about ten feet high, to serve for the axis of the\r\nstaircase. We had prepared, the evening before, a number of boards from\r\nthe staves of a large barrel, to form our steps. By the aid of the\r\nchisel and mallet, we made deep notches in the inner part of our tree,\r\nand corresponding notches in the central pillar; I placed my steps in\r\nthese notches, riveting them with large nails; I raised myself in this\r\nmanner step after step, but always turning round the pillar, till we got\r\nto the top. We then fixed on the central pillar another trunk of the\r\nsame height, prepared beforehand, and continued our winding steps. Four\r\ntimes we had to repeat this operation, and, finally, we reached our\r\nbranches, and terminated the staircase on the level of the floor of our\r\napartment. I cleared the entrance by some strokes of my axe. To render\r\nit more solid, I filled up the spaces between the steps with planks, and\r\nfastened two strong cords from above, to each side of the staircase, to\r\nhold by. Towards different points, I made openings; in which were placed\r\nthe windows taken from the cabin, which gave light to the interior, and\r\nfavoured our observations outside.\r\n\r\nThe construction of this solid and convenient staircase occupied us\r\nduring a month of patient industry; not that we laboured like slaves,\r\nfor we had no one to constrain us; we had in this time completed several\r\nworks of less importance; and many events had amused us amidst our toil.\r\n\r\nA few days after we commenced, Flora produced six puppies; but the\r\nnumber being too large for our means of support, I commanded that only a\r\nmale and female should be preserved, that the breed might be\r\nperpetuated; this was done, and the little jackal being placed with the\r\nremainder, Flora gave it the same privileges as her own offspring. Our\r\ngoats also, about this time, gave us two kids; and our sheep some lambs.\r\nWe saw this increase of our flock with great satisfaction; and for fear\r\nthese useful animals should take it into their heads to stray from us,\r\nas our ass had done, we tied round their necks some small bells we had\r\nfound on the wreck, intended to propitiate the savages, and which would\r\nalways put us on the track of the fugitives.\r\n\r\nThe education of the young buffalo was one of the employments that\r\nvaried our labour as carpenters. Through the incision in his nostrils, I\r\nhad passed a small stick, to the ends of which I attached a strap. This\r\nformed a kind of bit, after the fashion of those of the Hottentots; and\r\nby this I guided him as I chose; though not without much rebellion on\r\nhis part. It was only after Fritz had broken it in for mounting, that we\r\nbegan to make it carry. It was certainly a remarkable instance of\r\npatience and perseverance surmounting difficulties, that we not only\r\nmade it bear the wallets we usually placed on the ass, but Ernest, Jack,\r\nand even little Francis, took lessons in _horsemanship_, by riding him,\r\nand, henceforward, would have been able to ride the most spirited horse\r\nwithout fear; for it could not be worse than the buffalo they had\r\nassisted to subdue.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this, Fritz did not neglect the training of his young\r\neagle. The royal bird began already to pounce very cleverly on the dead\r\ngame his master brought, and placed before him; sometimes between the\r\nhorns of the buffalo, sometimes on the back of the great bustard, or the\r\nflamingo; sometimes he put it on a board, or on the end of a pole, to\r\naccustom it to pounce, like the falcon, on other birds. He taught it to\r\nsettle on his wrist at a call, or a whistle; but it was some time before\r\nhe could trust it to fly, without a long string attached to its leg, for\r\nfear its wild nature should carry it from us for ever. Even the indolent\r\nErnest was seized with the mania of instructing animals. He undertook\r\nthe education of his little monkey, who gave him sufficient employment.\r\nIt was amusing to see the quiet, slow, studious Ernest obliged to make\r\nleaps and gambols with his pupil to accomplish his instruction. He\r\nwished to accustom Master Knips to carry a pannier, and to climb the\r\ncocoa-nut trees with it on his back; Jack and he wove a small light\r\npannier of rushes, and fixed it firmly on his back with three straps.\r\nThis was intolerable to him at first; he ground his teeth, rolled on the\r\nground, and leaped about in a frantic manner, trying in vain to release\r\nhimself. They left the pannier on his back night and day, and only\r\nallowed him to eat what he had previously put into it. After a little\r\ntime, he became so accustomed to it, that he rebelled if they wished to\r\nremove it, and threw into it everything they gave him to hold. He was\r\nvery useful to us, but he obeyed only Ernest, who had very properly\r\ntaught him equally to love and fear him.\r\n\r\nJack was not so successful with his jackal; for, though he gave him the\r\nname of _“The Hunter,”_ yet, for the first six months, the carnivorous\r\nanimal chased only for himself, and, if he brought anything to his\r\nmaster, it was only the skin of the animal he had just devoured; but I\r\ncharged him not to despair, and he continued zealously his instructions.\r\n\r\nDuring this time I had perfected my candle manufacture; by means of\r\nmixing the bees’ wax with that obtained from the candle-berry, and by\r\nusing cane moulds, which Jack first suggested to me, I succeeded in\r\ngiving my candles the roundness and polish of those of Europe. The wicks\r\nwere for some time an obstacle. I did not wish to use the small quantity\r\nof calico we had left, but my wife happily proposed to me to substitute\r\nthe pith of a species of elder, which answered my purpose completely.\r\n\r\nI now turned myself to the preparation of the caoutchouc, of which we\r\nhad found several trees. I encouraged the boys to try their ingenuity in\r\nmaking flasks and cups, by covering moulds of clay with the gum, as I\r\nhad explained to them. For my part, I took a pair of old stockings, and\r\nfilled them with sand for my mould, which I covered with a coating of\r\nmud, and left to dry in the sun. I cut out a pair of soles of buffalo\r\nleather, which I first hammered well, and then fastened with small tacks\r\nto the sole of the stocking, filling up the spaces left with the gum, so\r\nas to fix it completely. Then, with a brush of goats hair, I covered it\r\nwith layer upon layer of the elastic gum, till I thought it sufficiently\r\nthick. It was easy after this to remove the sand, the stocking, and the\r\nhardened mud, to shake out the dust, and I had a pair of waterproof\r\nboots, without seam, and fitting as well as if I had employed an English\r\nshoemaker. My boys were wild with joy, and all begged for a pair; but I\r\nwished first to try their durability, compared with those of buffalo\r\nleather. I began to make a pair of boots for Fritz, using the skin drawn\r\nfrom the legs of the buffalo we had killed; but I had much more\r\ndifficulty than with the caoutchouc. I used the gum to cover the seams,\r\nso that the water might not penetrate. They were certainly not elegant\r\nas a work of art, and the boys laughed at their brother’s awkward\r\nmovements in them; but their own productions, though useful vessels,\r\nwere not models of perfection.\r\n\r\nWe then worked at our fountain, a great source of pleasure to my wife\r\nand to all of us. We raised, in the upper part of the river, a sort of\r\ndam, made with stakes and stones, from whence the water flowed into our\r\nchannels of the sago-palm, laid down a gentle declivity nearly to our\r\ntent, and there it was received into the shell of the turtle, which we\r\nhad raised on some stones of a convenient height, the hole which the\r\nharpoon had made serving to carry off the waste water through a cane\r\nthat was fitted to it. On two crossed sticks were placed the gourds that\r\nserved us for pails, and thus we had always the murmuring of the water\r\nnear us, and a plentiful supply of it, always pure and clean, which the\r\nriver, troubled by our water-fowl and the refuse of decayed leaves,\r\ncould not always give us. The only inconvenience of these open channels\r\nwas, that the water reached us warm and unrefreshing; but this I hoped\r\nto remedy in time, by using bamboo pipes buried in the earth. In the\r\nmean time, we were grateful for this new acquisition, and gave credit to\r\nFritz, who had suggested the idea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning, as we were engaged in giving the last finish to our\r\nstaircase, we were alarmed at hearing at a distance strange, sharp,\r\nprolonged sounds, like the roars of a wild beast, but mingled with an\r\nunaccountable hissing. Our dogs erected their ears, and prepared for\r\ndeadly combat. I assembled my family; we then ascended our tree, closing\r\nthe lower door, loaded our guns, and looked anxiously round, but nothing\r\nappeared. I armed my dogs with their porcupine coats of mail and\r\ncollars, and left them below to take care of our animals.\r\n\r\nThe horrible howlings seemed to approach nearer to us; at length, Fritz,\r\nwho was leaning forward to listen as attentively as he could, threw down\r\nhis gun, and bursting into a loud laugh, cried out, “It is our fugitive,\r\nthe ass, come back to us, and singing his song of joy on his return!” We\r\nlistened, and were sure he was right, and could not but feel a little\r\nvexation at being put into such a fright by a donkey. Soon after, we had\r\nthe pleasure of seeing him appear among the trees; and, what was still\r\nbetter, he was accompanied by another animal of his own species, but\r\ninfinitely more beautiful. I knew it at once to be the onagra, or wild\r\nass, a most important capture, if we could make it; though all\r\nnaturalists have declared it impossible to tame this elegant creature,\r\nyet I determined to make the attempt.\r\n\r\nI went down with Fritz, exhorting his brothers to remain quiet, and I\r\nconsulted with my privy counsellor on the means of taking our prize. I\r\nalso prepared, as quickly as possible, a long cord with a noose, kept\r\nopen by a slight stick, which would fall out as soon as the animal’s\r\nhead entered, while any attempt to escape would only draw the noose\r\ncloser; the end of this cord was tied to the root of a tree. I took then\r\na piece of bamboo, about two feet long, and splitting it up, tied it\r\nfirmly at one end, to form a pair of pincers for the nose of the animal.\r\nIn the mean time, the two animals had approached nearer, our old Grizzle\r\napparently doing the honours to his visitor, and both grazing very\r\ncomfortably.\r\n\r\nBy degrees we advanced softly to them, concealed by the trees; Fritz\r\ncarrying the lasso, and I the pincers. The onagra, as soon as he got\r\nsight of Fritz, who was before me, raised his head, and started back,\r\nevidently only in surprise, as it was probably the first man the\r\ncreature had seen. Fritz remained still, and the animal resumed his\r\nbrowsing. Fritz went up to our old servant, and offered him a handful of\r\noats mixed with salt; the ass came directly to eat its favourite treat;\r\nits companion followed, raised its head, snuffed the air, and came so\r\nnear, that Fritz adroitly threw the noose over its head. The terrified\r\nanimal attempted to fly, but that drew the cord so tight as almost to\r\nstop his respiration, and he lay down, his tongue hanging out. I\r\nhastened up and relaxed the cord, lest he should be strangled. I threw\r\nthe halter of the ass round his neck, and placed the split cane over\r\nhis nose, tying it firmly below with a string. I subdued this wild\r\nanimal by the means that blacksmiths use the first time they shoe a\r\nhorse. I then took off the noose, and tied the halter by two long cords\r\nto the roots of two separate trees, and left him to recover himself.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the rest of the family had collected to admire this\r\nnoble animal, whose graceful and elegant form, so superior to that of\r\nthe ass, raises it almost to the dignity of a horse. After a while it\r\nrose, and stamped furiously with its feet, trying to release itself; but\r\nthe pain in its nose obliged it to lie down again. Then my eldest son\r\nand I, approaching gently, took the two cords, and led or dragged it\r\nbetween two roots very near to each other, to which we tied the cords so\r\nshort, that it had little power to move, and could not escape. We took\r\ncare our own donkey should not stray again, by tying his fore-feet\r\nloosely, and putting on him a new halter, and left him near the onagra.\r\n\r\nI continued, with a patience I had never had in Europe, to use every\r\nmeans I could think of with our new guest, and at the end of a month he\r\nwas so far subdued, that I ventured to begin his education. This was a\r\nlong and difficult task. We placed some burdens on his back; but the\r\nobedience necessary before we could mount him, it seemed impossible to\r\ninstil into him. At last, I recollected the method they use in America\r\nto tame the wild horses, and I resolved to try it. In spite of the\r\nbounds and kicks of the furious animal, I leaped on his back, and\r\nseizing one of his long ears between my teeth, I bit it till the blood\r\ncame. In a moment he reared himself almost erect on his hind-feet,\r\nremained for a while stiff and motionless, then came down on his\r\nfore-feet slowly, I still holding on his ear. At last I ventured to\r\nrelease him; he made some leaps, but soon subsided into a sort of trot,\r\nI having previously placed loose cords on his fore legs. From that time\r\nwe were his masters; my sons mounted him one after another; they gave\r\nhim the name of Lightfoot, and never animal deserved his name better. As\r\na precaution, we kept the cords on his legs for some time; and as he\r\nnever would submit to the bit, we used a snaffle, by which we obtained\r\npower over his head, guiding him by a stick, with which we struck the\r\nright or left ear, as we wished him to go.\r\n\r\nDuring this time, our poultry-yard was increased by three broods of\r\nchickens. We had at least forty of these little creatures chirping and\r\npecking about, the pride of their good mistress’s heart. Part of these\r\nwere kept at home, to supply the table, and part she allowed to colonize\r\nin the woods, where we could find them when we wanted them. “These,” she\r\nsaid, “are of more use than your monkeys, jackals, and eagles, who do\r\nnothing but eat, and would not be worth eating themselves, if we were in\r\nneed.” However, she allowed there was some use in the buffalo, who\r\ncarried burdens, and Lightfoot, who carried her sons so well. The fowls,\r\nwhich cost us little for food, would be always ready, she said, either\r\nto supply us with eggs or chickens, when the rainy season came on—the\r\nwinter of this climate.\r\n\r\nThis reminded me that the approach of that dreary season permitted me no\r\nlonger to defer a very necessary work for the protection of our\r\nanimals. This was to construct, under the roots of the trees, covered\r\nhouses for them. We began by making a kind of roof above the vaulted\r\nroots of our tree. We used bamboo canes for this purpose; the longer and\r\nstouter were used for the supports, like columns, the slighter ones\r\nbound together closely formed the roof. The intervals we filled up with\r\nmoss and clay, and spread over the whole a coating of tar. The roof was\r\nso firm, that it formed a platform, which we surrounded with a railing;\r\nand thus we had a balcony, and a pleasant promenade. By the aid of some\r\nboards nailed to the roots, we made several divisions in the interior,\r\neach little enclosure being appropriated to some useful purpose; and\r\nthus, stables, poultry-houses, dairy, larder, hay-house, store-room,\r\n&c., besides our dining-room, were all united under one roof. This\r\noccupied us some time, as it was necessary to fill our store-room before\r\nthe bad weather came; and our cart was constantly employed in bringing\r\nuseful stores.\r\n\r\nOne evening, as we were bringing home a load of potatoes on our cart,\r\ndrawn by the ass, the cow, and the buffalo, I saw the cart was not yet\r\nfull; I therefore sent home the two younger boys with their mother, and\r\nwent on with Fritz and Ernest to the oak wood, to collect a sack of\r\nsweet acorns—Fritz mounted on his onagra, Ernest followed by his\r\nmonkey, and I carrying the bag. On arriving at the wood, we tied\r\nLightfoot to a tree, and all three began to gather the dropped acorns,\r\nwhen we were startled by the cries of birds, and a loud flapping of\r\nwings, and we concluded that a brisk combat was going on between Master\r\nKnips and the tenants of the thickets, from whence the noise came.\r\nErnest went softly to see what was the matter, and we soon heard him\r\ncalling out, “Be quick! a fine heath-fowl’s nest, full of eggs! Knips\r\nwants to suck them, and the mother is beating him.”\r\n\r\nFritz ran up, and secured the two beautiful birds, who fluttered, and\r\ncried out furiously, and returned, followed by Ernest, carrying a large\r\nnest filled with eggs. The monkey had served us well on this occasion;\r\nfor the nest was so hidden by a bush with long leaves, of which Ernest\r\nheld his hand full, that, but for the instinct of the animal, we could\r\nnever have discovered it. Ernest was overjoyed to carry the nest and\r\neggs for his dear mamma, and the long, pointed leaves he intended for\r\nFrancis, to serve as little toy-swords.\r\n\r\nWe set out on our return, placing the sack of acorns behind Fritz on\r\nLightfoot; Ernest carried the two fowls, and I charged myself with the\r\ncare of the eggs, which I covered up, as I found they were warm, and I\r\nhoped to get the mother to resume her brooding when we got to Falcon’s\r\nNest. We were all delighted with the good news we should have to carry\r\nhome, and Fritz, anxious to be first, struck his charger with a bunch of\r\nthe pointed leaves he had taken from Ernest: this terrified the animal\r\nso much, that he took the bit in his teeth, and flew out of sight like\r\nan arrow. We followed, in some uneasiness, but found him safe. Master\r\nLightfoot had stopped of himself when he reached his stable. My wife\r\nplaced the valuable eggs under a sitting hen, the true mother refusing\r\nto fulfil her office. She was then put into the cage of the poor\r\nparrot, and hung in our dining-room, to accustom her to society. In a\r\nfew days the eggs were hatched, and the poultry-yard had an increase of\r\nfifteen little strangers, who fed greedily on bruised acorns, and soon\r\nbecame as tame as any of our fowls, though I plucked the large feathers\r\nout of their wings when they were full-grown, lest their wild nature\r\nshould tempt them to quit us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrancis had soon become tired of playing with the long leaves his\r\nbrother had brought him, and they were thrown aside. Fritz happened to\r\ntake some of the withered leaves up, which were soft and flexible as a\r\nribbon, and he advised Francis to make whiplashes of them, to drive the\r\ngoats and sheep with, for the little fellow was the shepherd. He was\r\npleased with the idea, and began to split the leaves into strips, which\r\nFritz platted together into very good whiplashes. I remarked, as they\r\nwere working, how strong and pliant these strips seemed, and, examining\r\nthem closely, I found they were composed of long fibres, or filaments,\r\nwhich made me suspect it to be _Phormium tenax_, or New Zealand flax, a\r\nmost important discovery to us, and which, when I communicated it to my\r\nwife, almost overwhelmed her with joy. “Bring me all the leaves you can\r\nwithout delay,” cried she, “and I will make you stockings, shirts,\r\ncoats, sewing-thread, cords—in fact, give me but flax and work-tools,\r\nand I can manage all.” I could not help smiling at the vivacity of her\r\nimagination, roused at the very name of flax; but there was still great\r\nspace between the leaves lying before us and the linen she was already\r\nsewing in idea. But my boys, always ready to second the wishes of their\r\nbeloved mother, soon mounted their coursers, Fritz on Lightfoot, and\r\nJack on the great buffalo, to procure supplies.\r\n\r\nWhilst we waited for these, my wife, all life and animation, explained\r\nto me all the machines I must make, to enable her to spin and weave, and\r\nmake linen to clothe us from head to foot; her eyes sparkled with\r\ndelight as she spoke, and I promised her all she asked.\r\n\r\nIn a short time, our young cavaliers returned from their foraging\r\nexpedition, conveying on their steeds huge bundles of the precious\r\nplant, which they laid at the feet of their mother. She gave up\r\neverything to begin her preparation. The first operation necessary was\r\nto steep the flax, which is usually done by exposing it in the open air\r\nin the rain, the wind, and the dew, so as, in a certain degree, to\r\ndissolve the plant, rendering the separation of the fibrous and ligneous\r\nparts more easy. It can then be cleaned and picked for spinning. But, as\r\nthe vegetable glue that connects the two parts is very tenacious, and\r\nresists for a long time the action of moisture, it is often advisable to\r\nsteep it in water, and this, in our dry climate, I considered most\r\nexpedient.\r\n\r\nMy wife agreed to this, and proposed that we should convey it to\r\nFlamingo Marsh; and we spent the rest of the day in tying up the leaves\r\nin bundles. Next morning, we loaded our cart, and proceeded to the\r\nmarsh: we there untied our bundles, and spread them in the water,\r\npressing them down with stones, and leaving them till it was time to\r\ntake them out to dry. We could not but admire here the ingenious nests\r\nof the flamingo; they are of a conical form, raised above the level of\r\nthe marsh, having a recess above, in which the eggs are deposited, out\r\nof the reach of danger, and the female can sit on them with her legs in\r\nthe water. These nests are of clay, and so solid, that they resist the\r\nwater till the young are able to swim.\r\n\r\nIn a fortnight the flax was ready to be taken out of the water; we\r\nspread it in the sun, which dried it so effectually, that we brought it\r\nto Falcon’s Nest the same evening, where it was stored till we were\r\nready for further operations. At present we laboured to lay up provision\r\nfor the rainy season, leaving all sedentary occupations to amuse us in\r\nour confinement. We brought in continually loads of sweet acorns,\r\nmanioc, potatoes, wood, fodder for the cattle, sugar-canes, fruit,\r\nindeed everything that might be useful during the uncertain period of\r\nthe rainy season. We profited by the last few days to sow the wheat and\r\nother remaining European grains, that the rain might germinate them. We\r\nhad already had some showers; the temperature was variable, the sky\r\nbecame cloudy, and the wind rose. The season changed sooner than we\r\nexpected; the winds raged through the woods, the sea roared, mountains\r\nof clouds were piled in the heavens. They soon burst over our heads, and\r\ntorrents of rain fell night and day, without intermission; the rivers\r\nswelled till their waters met, and turned the whole country around us\r\ninto an immense lake. Happily we had formed our little establishment on\r\na spot rather elevated above the rest of the valley; the waters did not\r\nquite reach our tree, but surrounded us about two hundred yards off,\r\nleaving us on a sort of island in the midst of the general inundation.\r\nWe were reluctantly obliged to descend from our aërial abode; the rain\r\nentered it on all sides, and the hurricane threatened every moment to\r\ncarry away the apartment, and all that were in it. We set about our\r\nremoval, bringing down our hammocks and bedding to the sheltered space\r\nunder the roots of the trees that we had roofed for the animals. We were\r\npainfully crowded in the small space; the stores of provisions, the\r\ncooking utensils, and especially the neighbourhood of the animals, and\r\nthe various offensive smells, made our retreat almost insupportable. We\r\nwere choked with smoke if we lighted a fire, and inundated with rain if\r\nwe opened a door. For the first time since our misfortune, we sighed for\r\nthe comforts of our native home; but action was necessary, and we set\r\nabout endeavouring to amend our condition.\r\n\r\nThe winding staircase was very useful to us; the upper part was crowded\r\nwith things we did not want, and my wife frequently worked in the lower\r\npart, at one of the windows. We crowded our beasts a little more, and\r\ngave a current of air to the places they had left. I placed outside the\r\nenclosure the animals of the country, which could bear the inclemency of\r\nthe season; thus I gave a half-liberty to the buffalo and the onagra,\r\ntying their legs loosely, to prevent them straying, the boughs of the\r\ntree affording them a shelter. We made as few fires as possible, as,\r\nfortunately it was never cold, and we had no provisions that required a\r\nlong process of cookery. We had milk in abundance, smoked meat, and\r\nfish, the preserved ortolans, and cassava cakes. As we sent out some of\r\nour animals in the morning, with bells round their necks, Fritz and I\r\nhad to seek them and bring them in every evening, when we were\r\ninvariably wet through. This induced my ingenious Elizabeth to make us a\r\nsort of blouse and hood out of old garments of the sailors, which we\r\ncovered with coatings of the caoutchouc, and thus obtained two capital\r\nwaterproof dresses; all that the exhausted state of our gum permitted\r\nus to make.\r\n\r\nThe care of our animals occupied us a great part of the morning, then we\r\nprepared our cassava, and baked our cakes on iron plates. Though we had\r\na glazed door to our hut, the gloominess of the weather, and the\r\nobscurity caused by the vast boughs of the tree, made night come on\r\nearly. We then lighted a candle, fixed in a gourd on the table, round\r\nwhich we were all assembled. The good mother laboured with her needle,\r\nmending the clothes; I wrote my journal, which Ernest copied, as he\r\nwrote a beautiful hand; while Fritz and Jack taught their young brother\r\nto read and write, or amused themselves with drawing the animals or\r\nplants they had been struck with. We read the lessons from the Bible in\r\nturns, and concluded the evening with devotion. We then retired to rest,\r\ncontent with ourselves and with our innocent and peaceful life. Our kind\r\nhousekeeper often made us a little feast of a roast chicken, a pigeon,\r\nor a duck, and once in four or five days we had fresh butter made in the\r\ngourd churn; and the delicious honey which we ate to our cassava bread\r\nmight have been a treat to European epicures.\r\n\r\nThe remains of our repast was always divided among our domestic animals.\r\nWe had four dogs, the jackal, the eagle, and the monkey, who relied on\r\ntheir masters, and were never neglected. But if the buffalo, the onagra,\r\nand the sow had not been able to provide for themselves, we must have\r\nkilled them, for we had no food for them.\r\n\r\nWe now decided that we would not expose ourselves to another rainy\r\nseason in such an unsuitable habitation; even my gentle Elizabeth got\r\nout of temper with the inconveniences, and begged we would build a\r\nbetter winter house; stipulating, however, that we should return to our\r\ntree in summer. We consulted a great deal on this matter; Fritz quoted\r\nRobinson Crusoe, who had cut a dwelling out of the rock, which sheltered\r\nhim in the inclement season; and the idea of making our home at Tent\r\nHouse naturally came into my mind. It would probably be a long and\r\ndifficult undertaking, but with time, patience, and perseverance, we\r\nmight work wonders. We resolved, as soon as the weather would allow us,\r\nto go and examine the rocks at Tent House.\r\n\r\nThe last work of the winter was, at my wife’s incessant request, a\r\nbeetle for her flax, and some carding-combs. The beetle was easily made,\r\nbut the combs cost much trouble. I filed large nails till they were\r\nround and pointed, I fixed them, slightly inclined, at equal distances,\r\nin a sheet of tin, and raised the edge like a box; I then poured melted\r\nlead between the nails and the edge, to fix them more firmly. I nailed\r\nthis on a board, and the machine was fit for use, and my wife was all\r\nanxiety to begin her manufacture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nI cannot describe our delight when, after long and gloomy weeks, we saw\r\nat length the sky clear, and the sun, dispersing the dark clouds of\r\nwinter, spread its vivifying rays over all nature; the winds were\r\nlulled, the waters subsided, and the air became mild and serene. We went\r\nout, with shouts of joy, to breathe the balmy air, and gratified our\r\neyes with the sight of the fresh verdure already springing up around us.\r\nNature seemed in her youth again, and amidst the charms that breathed on\r\nevery side, we forgot our sufferings, and, like the children of Noah\r\ncoming forth from the ark, we raised a hymn of thanksgiving to the Giver\r\nof all good.\r\n\r\nAll our plantations and seeds had prospered. The corn was springing, and\r\nthe trees were covered with leaves and blossoms. The air was perfumed\r\nwith the odour of countless beautiful flowers; and lively with the songs\r\nand cries of hundreds of brilliant birds, all busy building their nests.\r\nThis was really spring in all its glory.\r\n\r\nWe began our summer occupation by cleaning and putting in order our\r\ndormitory in the tree, which the rain and the scattered leaves had\r\ngreatly deranged; and in a few days we were able to inhabit it again. My\r\nwife immediately began with her flax; while my sons were leading the\r\ncattle to the pasture, I took the bundles of flax into the open air,\r\nwhere I constructed a sort of oven of stone, which dried it completely.\r\nWe began that very evening to strip, beat, and comb it; and I drew out\r\nsuch handfuls of soft, fine flax, ready for spinning, that my wife was\r\noverjoyed, and begged me to make her a wheel, that she might commence.\r\n\r\nI had formerly had a little taste for turning, and though I had now\r\nneither lathe nor any other of the tools, yet I knew how a\r\nspinning-wheel and reel should be made, and, by dint of application, I\r\nsucceeded in completing these two machines to her satisfaction. She\r\nbegan to spin with so much earnestness, that she would hardly take a\r\nwalk, and reluctantly left her wheel to make dinner ready. She employed\r\nFrancis to reel off the thread as she spun it, and would willingly have\r\nhad the elder boys to take her place when she was called off; but they\r\nrebelled at the effeminate work, except Ernest, whose indolent habits\r\nmade him prefer it to more laborious occupation.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time we walked over to Tent House to see the state of\r\nthings, and found that winter had done more damage there than at\r\nFalcon’s Nest. The storm had overthrown the tent, carried away some of\r\nthe sailcloth, and injured our provisions so much, that great part was\r\ngood for nothing, and the rest required to be immediately dried.\r\nFortunately our beautiful pinnace had not suffered much,—it was still\r\nsafe at anchor, and fit for use; but our tub boat was entirely\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nOur most important loss was two barrels of gunpowder, which had been\r\nleft in the tent, instead of under the shelter of the rock, and which\r\nthe rain had rendered wholly useless. This made us feel still more\r\nstrongly the necessity of securing for the future a more suitable\r\nshelter than a canvas tent, or a roof of foliage. Still I had small hope\r\nfrom the gigantic plan of Fritz or the boldness of Jack. I could not be\r\nblind to the difficulties of the undertaking. The rocks which surrounded\r\nTent House presented an unbroken surface, like a wall without any\r\ncrevice, and, to all appearance, of so hard a nature as to leave little\r\nhopes of success. However, it was necessary to try to contrive some sort\r\nof cave, if only for our gunpowder. I made up my mind, and selected the\r\nmost perpendicular face of the rock as the place to begin our work. It\r\nwas a much pleasanter situation than our tent, commanding a view of the\r\nwhole bay, and the two banks of Jackal River, with its picturesque\r\nbridge. I marked out with chalk the dimension of the entrance I wished\r\nto give to the cave; then my sons and I took our chisels, pickaxes, and\r\nheavy miner’s hammers, and began boldly to hew the stone.\r\n\r\nOur first blows produced very little effect; the rock seemed\r\nimpenetrable, the sun had so hardened the surface; and the sweat poured\r\noff our brows with the hard labour. Nevertheless, the efforts of my\r\nyoung workmen did not relax. Every evening we left our work advanced,\r\nperhaps, a few inches; and every morning returned to the task with\r\nrenewed ardour. At the end of five or six days, when the surface of the\r\nrock was removed, we found the stone become easier to work; it then\r\nseemed calcarious, and, finally, only a sort of hardened clay, which we\r\ncould remove with spades; and we began to hope. After a few days’ more\r\nlabour, we found we had advanced about seven feet. Fritz wheeled out the\r\nrubbish, and formed a sort of terrace with it before the opening; while\r\nI was working at the higher part, Jack, as the least, worked below. One\r\nmorning he was hammering an iron bar, which he had pointed at the end,\r\ninto the rock, to loosen the earth, when he suddenly cried out—\r\n\r\n“Papa! papa! I have pierced through!”\r\n\r\n“Not through your hand, child?” asked I.\r\n\r\n“No, papa!” cried he; “I have pierced through the mountain! Huzza!”\r\n\r\nFritz ran in at the shout, and told him he had better have said at once\r\nthat he had pierced through the earth! But Jack persisted that, however\r\nhis brother might laugh, he was quite sure he had felt his iron bar\r\nenter an empty space behind. I now came down from my ladder, and, moving\r\nthe bar, I felt there was really a hollow into which the rubbish fell,\r\nbut apparently very little below the level we were working on. I took a\r\nlong pole and probed the cavity, and found that it must be of\r\nconsiderable size. My boys wished to have the opening enlarged and to\r\nenter immediately, but this I strictly forbade; for, as I leaned forward\r\nto examine it through the opening, a rush of mephitic air gave me a sort\r\nof vertigo. “Come away, children,” cried I, in terror; “the air you\r\nwould breathe there is certain death.” I explained to them that, under\r\ncertain circumstances, carbonic acid gas was frequently accumulated in\r\ncaves or grottoes, rendering the air unfit for respiration; producing\r\ngiddiness of the head, fainting, and eventually death. I sent them to\r\ncollect some hay, which I lighted and threw into the cave; this was\r\nimmediately extinguished; we repeated the experiment several times with\r\nthe same result. I now saw that more active means must be resorted to.\r\n\r\nWe had brought from the vessel a box of fireworks, intended for signals;\r\nI threw into the cave, by a cord, a quantity of rockets, grenades, &c.,\r\nand scattered a train of gunpowder from them; to this I applied a long\r\nmatch, and we retired to a little distance. This succeeded well; a great\r\nexplosion agitated the air, a torrent of the carbonic acid gas rushed\r\nthrough the opening, and was replaced by the pure air; we sent in a few\r\nmore rockets, which flew round like fiery dragons, disclosing to us the\r\nvast extent of the cave. A shower of stars, which concluded our\r\nexperiment, made us wish the duration had been longer. It seemed as if a\r\ncrowd of winged genii, carrying each a lamp, were floating about in that\r\nenchanted cavern. When they vanished, I threw in some more lighted hay,\r\nwhich blazed in such a lively manner, that I knew all danger was over\r\nfrom the gas; but, for fear of deep pits, or pools of water, I would not\r\nventure in without lights. I therefore despatched Jack, on his buffalo,\r\nto report this discovery to his mother, and bring all the candles she\r\nhad made. I purposely sent Jack on the errand, for his lively and poetic\r\nturn of mind would, I hoped, invest the grotto with such charms, that\r\nhis mother would even abandon her wheel to come and see it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “This succeeded well; a great explosion agitated the\r\nair—a torrent of the carbonic acid gas rushed through the opening.”]\r\n\r\nDelighted with his commission, Jack leaped upon his buffalo, and, waving\r\nhis whip, galloped off with an intrepidity that made my hair stand on\r\nend. During his absence, Fritz and I enlarged the opening, to make it\r\neasy of access, removed all the rubbish, and swept a road for mamma. We\r\nhad just finished, when we heard the sound of wheels crossing the\r\nbridge, and the cart appeared, drawn by the cow and ass, led by Ernest.\r\nJack rode before on his buffalo, blowing through his hand to imitate a\r\nhorn, and whipping the lazy cow and ass. He rode up first, and alighted\r\nfrom his huge courser, to help his mother out.\r\n\r\nI then lighted our candles, giving one to each, with a spare candle and\r\nflint and steel in our pockets. We took our arms, and proceeded in a\r\nsolemn manner into the rock. I walked first, my sons followed, and their\r\nmother came last, with Francis. We had not gone on above a few steps,\r\nwhen we stopped, struck with wonder and admiration; all was glittering\r\naround us; we were in a grotto of diamonds! From the height of the lofty\r\nvaulted roof hung innumerable crystals, which, uniting with those on the\r\nwalls, formed colonnades, altars, and every sort of gothic ornament of\r\ndazzling lustre, creating a fairy palace, or an illuminated temple.\r\n\r\nWhen we were a little recovered from our first astonishment, we advanced\r\nwith more confidence. The grotto was spacious, the floor smooth, and\r\ncovered with a fine dry sand. From the appearance of these crystals, I\r\nsuspected their nature, and, on breaking off a piece and tasting it, I\r\nfound, to my great joy, that we were in a grotto of rock salt, which is\r\nfound in large masses in the earth, usually above a bed of gypsum, and\r\nsurrounded by fossils. We were charmed with this discovery, of which we\r\ncould no longer have a doubt. What an advantage this was to our cattle,\r\nand to ourselves! We could now procure this precious commodity without\r\ncare or labour. The acquisition was almost as valuable as this brilliant\r\nretreat was in itself, of which we were never tired of admiring the\r\nbeauty. My wife was struck with our good fortune in opening the rock\r\nprecisely at the right spot; but I was of opinion, that this mine was of\r\ngreat extent, and that we could not well have missed it. Some blocks of\r\nsalt were scattered on the ground, which had apparently fallen from the\r\nvaulted roof. I was alarmed; for such an accident might destroy one of\r\nmy children; but, on examination, I found the mass above too solid to be\r\ndetached spontaneously, and I concluded that the explosion of the\r\nfireworks had given this shock to the subterranean palace, which had not\r\nbeen entered since the creation of the world. I feared there might yet\r\nbe some pieces loosened; I therefore sent out my wife and younger sons.\r\nFritz and I remained, and, after carefully examining the suspected\r\nparts, we fired our guns, and watched the effect; one or two pieces\r\nfell, but the rest remained firm, though we struck with long poles as\r\nhigh as we could reach. We were now satisfied of the security of our\r\nmagnificent abode, and began to plan our arrangements for converting it\r\ninto a convenient and pleasant habitation. The majority were for coming\r\nhere immediately, but the wiser heads determined that, for this year,\r\nFalcon’s Nest was to continue our home. There we went every night, and\r\nspent the day at Tent House, contriving and arranging our future\r\nwinter dwelling.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last bed of rock, before we reached the cave which Jack had pierced,\r\nwas so soft, and easy to work, that we had little difficulty in\r\nproportioning and opening the place for our door; I hoped that, being\r\nnow exposed to the heat of the sun, it would soon become as hard as the\r\noriginal surface. The door was that we had used for the staircase at\r\nFalcon’s Nest; for as we only intended to make a temporary residence of\r\nour old tree, there was no necessity for solid fittings; and, besides, I\r\nintended to close the entrance of the tree by a door of bark, more\r\neffectually to conceal it, in case savages should visit us. I then laid\r\nout the extent of the grotto at pleasure, for we had ample space. We\r\nbegan by dividing it into two parts; that on the right of the entrance\r\nwas to be our dwelling; on the left were, first, our kitchen, then the\r\nworkshop and the stables; behind these were the store-rooms and the\r\ncellar. In order to give light and air to our apartments, it was\r\nnecessary to insert in the rock the windows we had brought from the\r\nship; and this cost us many days of labour. The right-hand portion was\r\nsubdivided into three rooms: the first our own bedroom; the middle, the\r\ncommon sitting-room, and beyond the boys’ room. As we had only three\r\nwindows, we appropriated one to each bedroom, and the third to the\r\nkitchen, contenting ourselves, at present, with a grating in the\r\ndining-room. I constructed a sort of chimney in the kitchen, formed of\r\nfour boards, and conducted the smoke thus, through a hole made in the\r\nface of the rock. We made bur work-room spacious enough for us to carry\r\non all our manufactures, and it served also for our cart-house. Finally,\r\nall the partition-walls were put up, communicating by doors, and\r\ncompleting our commodious habitation. These various labours, the removal\r\nof our effects, and arranging them again, all the confusion of a change\r\nwhen it was necessary to be at once workmen and directors, took us a\r\ngreat part of summer; but the recollection of the vexations we should\r\nescape in the rainy season gave us energy.\r\n\r\nWe passed nearly all our time at Tent House, the centre of our\r\noperations; and, besides the gardens and plantations which surrounded\r\nit, we found many advantages which we profited by. Large turtles often\r\ncame to deposit their eggs in the sand, a pleasant treat for us; but we\r\nraised our desires to the possession of the turtles themselves, living,\r\nto eat when we chose. As soon as we saw one on the shore, one of my sons\r\nran to cut off its retreat. We then hastened to assist, turned the\r\ncreature on its back, passed a long cord through its shell, and tied it\r\nfirmly to a post close to the water. We then placed it on its legs, when\r\nof course it made for the water, but could only ramble the length of its\r\ncord; it seemed, however, very content, and we had it in readiness when\r\nwe wanted it. The lobsters, crabs, mussles, and every sort of fish which\r\nabounded on the coast, plentifully supplied our table. One morning, we\r\nwere struck with an extraordinary spectacle: a large portion of the sea\r\nappeared in a state of ebullition, and immense flocks of marine birds\r\nwere hovering over it, uttering piercing cries, and plunging into the\r\nwaves. From time to time the surface, on which the rising sun now shone,\r\nseemed covered with little flames, which rapidly appeared and vanished.\r\nSuddenly, this extraordinary mass advanced to the bay; and we ran down,\r\nfall of curiosity. We found, on our arrival, that this strange\r\nphenomenon was caused by a shoal of herrings. These shoals are so dense,\r\nthat they are often taken for sand-banks, are many leagues in extent,\r\nand several feet in depth: they spread themselves over the seas,\r\ncarrying to barren shores the resources that nature has denied them.\r\n\r\nThese brilliant, scaly creatures had now entered the bay, and my wife\r\nand children were lost in admiration of the wonderful sight; but I\r\nreminded them, that when Providence sends plenty, we ought to put forth\r\nour hands to take it. I sent immediately for the necessary utensils, and\r\norganized my fishery. Fritz and Jack stood in the water, and such was\r\nthe thickness of the shoal, that they filled baskets, taking them up as\r\nyou would water in a pail; they threw them on the sand; my wife and\r\nErnest cut them open, cleaned them, and rubbed them with salt; I\r\narranged them in small barrels, a layer of herrings and a layer of salt;\r\nand when the barrel was full, the ass, led by Francis, took them up to\r\nthe storehouse. This labour occupied us several days, and at the end of\r\nthat time we had a dozen barrels of excellent salt provision against the\r\nwinter season.\r\n\r\nThe refuse of this fishery, which we threw into the sea, attracted a\r\nnumber of sea-dogs; we killed several for the sake of the skin and the\r\noil, which would be useful to burn in lamps, or even as an ingredient\r\nin soap, which I hoped to make at some future time.\r\n\r\nAt this time I greatly improved my sledge, by placing it on two small\r\nwheels belonging to the guns of the ship, making it a light and\r\ncommodious carriage, and so low, that we could easily place heavy\r\nweights on it. Satisfied with our labours, we returned very happy to\r\nFalcon’s Nest, to spend our Sunday, and to thank God heartily for all\r\nthe blessings he had given us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe went on with our labours but slowly, as many employments diverted us\r\nfrom the great work. I had discovered that the crystals of salt in our\r\ngrotto had a bed of gypsum for their base, from which I hoped to obtain\r\na great advantage. I was fortunate enough to discover, behind a\r\nprojecting rock, a natural passage leading to our store-room, strewed\r\nwith fragments of gypsum. I took some of it to the kitchen, and by\r\nrepeated burnings calcined it, and reduced it to a fine white powder,\r\nwhich I put into casks, and carefully preserved for use. My intention\r\nwas, to form our partition-walls of square stones, cemented with the\r\ngypsum. I employed my sons daily to collect this, till we had amassed a\r\nlarge quantity; using some, in the first place, effectually to cover our\r\nherring-barrels. Four barrels were salted and covered in this way; the\r\nrest my wife smoked in a little hut of reeds and branches, in the midst\r\nof which the herrings were laid on sticks, and exposed to the smoke of\r\na fire of green moss kindled below. This dried them, and gave them the\r\npeculiar flavour so agreeable to many.\r\n\r\nWe were visited by another shoal of fish a month after that of the\r\nherrings. Jack first discovered them at the mouth of Jackal River, where\r\nthey had apparently come to deposit their eggs among the scattered\r\nstones. They were so large, that he was sure they must be whales. I\r\nfound them to be pretty large sturgeons, besides salmon, large trout,\r\nand many other fishes. Jack immediately ran for his bow and arrows, and\r\ntold me he would kill them all. He fastened the end of a ball of string\r\nto an arrow, with a hook at the end of it; he tied the bladders of the\r\ndog-fish at certain distances to the string; he then placed the ball\r\nsafe on the shore, took his bow, fixed the arrow in it, and aiming at\r\nthe largest salmon, shot it in the side; the fish tried to escape; I\r\nassisted him to draw the cord; it was no easy task, for he struggled\r\ntremendously; but at length, weakened by loss of blood, we drew him to\r\nland, and despatched him.\r\n\r\nThe other boys came running up to congratulate the young fisherman on\r\nhis invention, and as it was to be feared that the rest, alarmed by this\r\nattack, might take their departure, we determined to abandon everything\r\nfor the fishery. Fritz threw his harpoon, and landed, by means of the\r\nreel, some large salmon; Ernest took his rod, and caught trout; and I,\r\narmed like Neptune with an iron trident, succeeded in striking, amongst\r\nthe stones, some enormous fish. The greatest difficulty was to land our\r\nbooty; Fritz had struck a sturgeon at least eight feet long, which\r\nresisted our united efforts, till my wife brought the buffalo, which we\r\nharnessed to the line, and made ourselves masters of this immense prize.\r\n\r\nWe had a great deal of labour in opening and cleaning all our fish: some\r\nwe dried and salted; some my wife boiled in oil, as they preserve the\r\ntunny. The spawn of the sturgeon, a huge mass, weighing not less than\r\nthirty pounds, I laid aside to prepare as _caviare_, a favourite dish in\r\nHolland and Russia. I carefully cleansed the eggs from the skin and\r\nfibres that were mixed with them, washed them thoroughly in sea-water,\r\nslightly sprinkled them with salt, then put them in a gourd pierced with\r\nsmall holes to let the water escape, and placed weights on them to press\r\nthem completely for twenty-four hours. We then removed the caviare in\r\nsolid masses, like cheeses, took it to the smoking-hut to dry, and in a\r\nfew days had this large addition to our winter provision.\r\n\r\nMy next employment was the preparation of the valuable isinglass. I took\r\nthe air-bladder and sounds of the fish, cut them in strips, twisted them\r\nin rolls, and dried them in the sun. This is all that is necessary to\r\nprepare this excellent glue. It becomes very hard, and, when wanted for\r\nuse, is cut up in small pieces, and dissolved over a slow fire. The glue\r\nwas so white and transparent, that I hoped to make window-panes from it\r\ninstead of glass.\r\n\r\nAfter this work was finished, we began to plan a boat to replace our tub\r\nraft. I wished to try to make one of bark, as the savage nations do, and\r\nI proposed to make an expedition in search of a tree for our purpose.\r\nAll those in our own neighbourhood were too precious to destroy; some\r\nfor their fruits, others for their shade. We resolved to search at a\r\ndistance for trees fit for our purpose, taking in our road a survey of\r\nour plantations and fields. Our garden at Tent House produced abundantly\r\ncontinual successions of vegetables in that virgin soil, and in a\r\nclimate which recognized no change of season. The peas, beans, lentils,\r\nand lettuces were flourishing, and only required water, and our channels\r\nfrom the river brought this plentifully to us. We had delicious\r\ncucumbers and melons; the maize was already a foot high, the sugar-canes\r\nwere prospering, and the pine-apples on the high ground promised us a\r\nrich treat.\r\n\r\nWe hoped our distant plantations were going on as well, and all set out\r\none fine morning to Falcon’s Nest, to examine the state of things there.\r\nWe found my wife’s corn-fields were luxuriant in appearance, and for the\r\nmost part ready for cutting. There were barley, wheat, oats, beans,\r\nmillet, and lentils. We cut such of these as were ready, sufficient to\r\ngive us seeds for another year. The richest crop was the maize, which\r\nsuited the soil. But there were a quantity of gatherers more eager to\r\ntaste these new productions than we were; these were birds of every\r\nkind, from the bustard to the quail, and from the various establishments\r\nthey had formed round, it might be presumed they would not leave\r\nmuch for us.\r\n\r\nAfter our first shock at the sight of these robbers, we used some\r\nmeasures to lessen the number of them. Fritz unhooded his eagle, and\r\npointed out the dispersing bustards. The well-trained bird immediately\r\nsoared, and pounced on a superb bustard, and laid it at the feet of its\r\nmaster. The jackal, too, who was a capital pointer, brought to his\r\nmaster about a dozen little fat quails, which furnished us with an\r\nexcellent repast; to which my wife added a liquor of her own invention,\r\nmade of the green maize crushed in water, and mingled with the juice of\r\nthe sugar-cane; a most agreeable beverage, white as milk, sweet and\r\nrefreshing.\r\n\r\nWe found the bustard, which the eagle had struck down, but slightly\r\nwounded; we washed his hurts with a balsam made of wine, butter, and\r\nwater, and tied him by the leg in the poultry-yard, as a companion to\r\nour tame bustard.\r\n\r\nWe passed the remainder of the day at Falcon’s Nest, putting our summer\r\nabode into order, and thrashing out our grain, to save the precious seed\r\nfor another year. The Turkey wheat was laid by in sheaves, till we\r\nshould have time to thrash and winnow it; and then I told Fritz that it\r\nwould be necessary to put the hand-mill in order, that we had brought\r\nfrom the wreck. Fritz thought we could build a mill ourselves on the\r\nriver; but this bold scheme was, at present, impracticable.\r\n\r\nThe next day we set out on an excursion in the neighbourhood. My wife\r\nwished to establish colonies of our animals at some distance from\r\nFalcon’s Nest, at a convenient spot, where they would be secure, and\r\nmight find subsistence. She selected from her poultry-yard twelve young\r\nfowls; I took four young pigs, two couple of sheep, and two goats. These\r\nanimals were placed in the cart, in which we had previously placed our\r\nprovisions of every kind, and the tools and utensils we might need, not\r\nforgetting the rope ladder and the portable tent; we then harnessed the\r\nbuffalo, the cow, and the ass, and departed on our tour.\r\n\r\nFritz rode before on Lightfoot, to reconnoitre the ground, that we\r\nmight not plunge into any difficulties; as, this time, we went in a new\r\ndirection, exactly in the midst between the rocks and the shore, that we\r\nmight get acquainted with the whole of the country that stretched to\r\nCape Disappointment. We had the usual difficulty, at first, in getting\r\nthrough the high grass, and the underwood embarrassed our road, till we\r\nwere compelled to use the axe frequently. I made some trifling\r\ndiscoveries that were useful, while engaged in this labour; amongst\r\nothers, some roots of trees curved like saddles, and yokes for beasts of\r\ndraught. I cut away several of these, and placed them on the cart. When\r\nwe had nearly passed the wood, we were struck with the singular\r\nappearance of a little thicket of low bushes, apparently covered with\r\nsnow. Francis clapped his hands with joy, and begged to get out of the\r\ncart that he might make some snowballs. Fritz galloped forward, and\r\nreturned, bringing me a branch loaded with this beautiful white down,\r\nwhich, to my great joy, I recognized to be cotton. It was a discovery of\r\ninestimable value to us, and my wife began immediately to enumerate all\r\nthe advantages we should derive from it, when I should have constructed\r\nfor her the machines for spinning and weaving the cotton. We soon\r\ngathered as much as filled three bags, intending afterwards to collect\r\nthe seeds of this marvellous plant, to sow in the neighbourhood of\r\nTent House.\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the plain of the cotton-trees, we reached the summit of a\r\nhill, from which the eye rested on a terrestrial paradise. Trees of\r\nevery sort covered the sides of the hill, and a murmuring stream\r\ncrossed the plain, adding to its beauty and fertility. The wood we had\r\njust crossed formed a shelter against the north winds, and the rich\r\npasture offered food for our cattle. We decided at once that this should\r\nbe the site of our farm.\r\n\r\nWe erected our tent, made a fireplace, and set about cooking our dinner.\r\nWhile this was going on, Fritz and I sought a convenient spot for our\r\nstructure; and we met with a group of beautiful trees, at such a\r\ndistance one from another, as to form natural pillars for our dwelling;\r\nwe carried all our tools here; but as the day was far advanced, we\r\ndelayed commencing our work till next day. We returned to the tent, and\r\nfound my wife and her boys picking cotton, with which they made some\r\nvery comfortable beds, and we slept peacefully under our canvass roof.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe trees which I had chosen for my farmhouse were about a foot in\r\ndiameter in the trunk. They formed a long square; the long side facing\r\nthe sea. The dimensions of the whole were about twenty-four feet by\r\nsixteen. I cut deep mortices in the trees, about ten feet distant from\r\nthe ground, and again ten feet higher, to form a second story; I then\r\nplaced in them strong poles: this was the skeleton of my house—solid,\r\nif not elegant; I placed over this a rude roof of bark, cut in squares,\r\nand placed sloping, that the rain might run off. We fastened these with\r\nthe thorn of the acacia, as our nails were too precious to be lavished.\r\nWhile procuring the bark, we made many discoveries. The first was that\r\nof two remarkable trees,—the _Pistacia terebinthus_ and the _Pistacia\r\natlantica;_ the next, the thorny acacia, from which we got the\r\nsubstitute for nails.\r\n\r\nThe instinct of my goats led us also to find out, among the pieces of\r\nbark, that of the cinnamon, not perhaps equal to that of Ceylon, but\r\nvery fragrant and agreeable. But this was of little value, compared to\r\nthe turpentine and mastic I hoped to procure from the pistachios, to\r\ncompose a sort of pitch to complete our intended boat.\r\n\r\nWe continued our work at the house, which occupied us several days. We\r\nformed the walls of thin laths interwoven with long pliant reeds for\r\nabout six feet from the ground; the rest was merely a sort of light\r\ntrellis-work, to admit light and air. The door opened on the front to\r\nthe sea. The interior consisted simply of a series of compartments,\r\nproportioned to the guests they were to contain. One small apartment was\r\nfor ourselves, when we chose to visit our colony. On the upper story was\r\na sort of hayloft for the fodder. We projected plastering the walls with\r\nclay; but these finishing touches we deferred to a future time,\r\ncontented that we had provided a shelter for our cattle and fowls. To\r\naccustom them to come to this shelter of themselves, we took care to\r\nfill their racks with the food they liked best, mingled with salt; and\r\nthis we proposed to renew at intervals, till the habit of coming to\r\ntheir houses was fixed. We all laboured ardently, but the work proceeded\r\nslowly, from our inexperience; and the provisions we had brought were\r\nnearly exhausted. I did not wish to return to Falcon’s Nest till I had\r\ncompleted my new establishment, and therefore determined to send Fritz\r\nand Jack to look after the animals at home, and bring back a fresh stock\r\nof provisions. Our two young couriers set out, each on his favourite\r\nsteed, Fritz leading the ass to bring back the load, and Jack urging the\r\nindolent animal forward with his whip.\r\n\r\nDuring their absence, Ernest and I made a little excursion, to add to\r\nour provision—if we could meet with them, some potatoes and cocoa-nuts.\r\nWe ascended the stream for some time, which led us to a large marsh,\r\nbeyond which we discovered a lake abounding with water-fowl. This lake\r\nwas surrounded by tall, thick grass, with ears of a grain, which I found\r\nto be a very good, though small, sort of rice. As to the lake itself, it\r\nis only a Swiss, accustomed from his infancy to look on such smooth,\r\ntranquil waters, that can comprehend the happiness we felt on looking\r\nupon this. We fancied we were once more in Switzerland, our own dear\r\nland; but the majestic trees and luxuriant vegetation soon reminded us\r\nwe were no longer in Europe, and that the ocean separated us from our\r\nnative home.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Ernest had brought down several birds, with a skill\r\nand success that surprised me. A little after, we saw Knips leap off the\r\nback of his usual palfrey, Flora, and, making his way through the rich\r\ngrass, collect and carry rapidly to his mouth something that seemed\r\nparticularly to please his palate. We followed him, and, to our great\r\ncomfort, were able to refresh ourselves with that delicious strawberry\r\ncalled in Europe the Chili or pineapple strawberry. We ate plentifully\r\nof this fruit, which was of enormous size; Ernest especially enjoyed\r\nthem, but did not forget the absent; he filled Knips’s little pannier\r\nwith them, and I covered them with large leaves, which I fastened down\r\nwith reeds, lest he should take a fancy to help himself as we went home.\r\nI took, also, a specimen of rice, for the inspection of our good\r\nhousekeeper, who would, I knew, rejoice in such an acquisition.\r\n\r\nWe proceeded round the lake, which presented a different scene on every\r\nside. This was one of the most lovely and fertile parts we had yet seen\r\nof this country. Birds of all kinds abounded; but we were particularly\r\nstruck with a pair of black swans, sailing majestically on the water.\r\nTheir plumage was perfectly black and glossy, except the extremity of\r\nthe wings, which was white. Ernest would have tried his skill again, but\r\nI forbade him to disturb the profound tranquillity of this\r\ncharming region.\r\n\r\nBut Flora, who probably had not the same taste for the beauties of\r\nnature that I had, suddenly darted forward like an arrow, pounced upon a\r\ncreature that was swimming quietly at the edge of the water, and brought\r\nit to us. It was a most curious animal. It resembled an otter in form,\r\nbut was web-footed, had an erect bushy tail like the squirrel, small\r\nhead, eyes and ears almost invisible. A long, flat bill, like that of a\r\nduck, completed its strange appearance. We were completely puzzled—even\r\nErnest, the naturalist, could not give its name. I boldly gave it the\r\nname of the beast with a bill. I told Ernest to take it, as I wished to\r\nstuff and preserve it.\r\n\r\n“It will be,” said the little philosopher, “the first natural object for\r\nour museum.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” replied I; “and, when the establishment is fully arranged,\r\nwe will appoint you curator.”\r\n\r\nBut, thinking my wife would grow uneasy at our protracted absence, we\r\nreturned by a direct road to the tent. Our two messengers arrived about\r\nthe same time, and we all sat down together to a cheerful repast. Every\r\none related his feats. Ernest dwelt on his discoveries, and was very\r\npompous in his descriptions, and I was obliged to promise to take Fritz\r\nanother time. I learnt, with pleasure, that all was going on well at\r\nFalcon’s Nest, and that the boys had had the forethought to leave the\r\nanimals with provisions for ten days. This enabled me to complete my\r\nfarmhouse. We remained four days longer, in which time I finished the\r\ninterior, and my wife arranged in our own apartment the cotton\r\nmattresses, to be ready for our visits, and put into the houses the\r\nfodder and grain for their respective tenants. We then loaded our cart,\r\nand began our march. The animals wished to follow us, but Fritz, on\r\nLightfoot, covered our retreat, and kept them at the farm till we were\r\nout of sight.\r\n\r\nWe did not proceed directly, but went towards the wood of monkeys. These\r\nmischievous creatures assaulted us with showers of the fir-apples; but a\r\nfew shots dispersed our assailants.\r\n\r\nFritz collected some of these new fruits they had flung at us, and I\r\nrecognized them as those of the stone Pine, the kernel of which is good\r\nto eat, and produces an excellent oil. We gathered a bag of these, and\r\ncontinued our journey till we reached the neighbourhood of Cape\r\nDisappointment. There we ascended a little hill, from the summit of\r\nwhich we looked upon rich plains, rivers, and woods clothed with verdure\r\nand brilliant flowers, and gay birds that fluttered among the bushes.\r\n“Here, my children,” cried I, “here we will build our summer house. This\r\nis truly Arcadia.” Here we placed our tent, and immediately began to\r\nerect a new building, formed in the same manner as the Farm House, but\r\nnow executed more quickly. We raised the roof in the middle, and made\r\nfour sloped sides. The interior was divided into eating and sleeping\r\napartments, stables, and a store-room for provisions; the whole was\r\ncompleted and provisioned in ten days; and we had now another mansion\r\nfor ourselves, and a shelter for new colonies of animals. This new\r\nerection received the name of Prospect Hill, to gratify Ernest, who\r\nthought it had an English appearance.\r\n\r\nHowever, the end for which our expedition was planned was not yet\r\nfulfilled. I had not yet met with a tree likely to suit me for a boat.\r\nWe returned then to inspect the trees, and I fixed on a sort of oak, the\r\nbark of which was closer than that of the European oak, resembling more\r\nthat of the cork-tree. The trunk was at least five feet in diameter, and\r\nI fancied its coating, if I could obtain it whole, would perfectly\r\nanswer my purpose. I traced a circle at the foot, and with a small saw\r\ncut the bark entirely through; Fritz, by means of the rope ladder we had\r\nbrought with us, and attached to the lower branches of the tree,\r\nascended, and cut a similar circle eighteen feet above mine. We then cut\r\nout, perpendicularly, a slip the whole length, and, removing it, we had\r\nroom to insert the necessary tools, and, with wedges, we finally\r\nsucceeded in loosening the whole. The first part was easy enough, but\r\nthere was greater difficulty as we advanced. We sustained it as we\r\nproceeded with ropes, and then gently let it down on the grass. I\r\nimmediately began to form my boat while the bark was fresh and flexible.\r\nMy sons, in their impatience, thought it would do very well if we nailed\r\na board at each end of the roll; but this would have been merely a heavy\r\ntrough, inelegant and unserviceable; I wished to have one that would\r\nlook well by the side of the pinnace; and this idea at once rendered my\r\nboys patient and obedient. We began by cutting out at each end of the\r\nroll of bark a triangular piece of about five feet long; then, placing\r\nthe sloping parts one over the other, I united them with pegs and strong\r\nglue, and thus finished the ends of my boat in a pointed form. This\r\noperation having widened it too much in the middle, we passed strong\r\nropes round it, and drew it into the form we required. We then exposed\r\nit to the sun, which dried and fixed it in the proper shape.\r\n\r\nAs many things were necessary to complete my work, I sent Fritz and Jack\r\nto Tent House for the sledge, to convey it there, that we might finish\r\nit more conveniently. I had the good fortune to meet with some very\r\nhard, crooked wood, the natural curve of which would be admirably\r\nsuitable for supporting the sides of the boat. We found also a resinous\r\ntree, which distilled a sort of pitch, easy to manage, and which soon\r\nhardened in the sun. My wife and Francis collected sufficient of it for\r\nmy work. It was almost night when our two messengers returned. We had\r\nonly time to sup and retire to our rest.\r\n\r\nWe were all early at work next morning. We loaded the sledge, placing on\r\nit the canoe, the wood for the sides, the pitch, and some young trees,\r\nwhich I had transplanted for our plantation at Tent House, and which we\r\nput into the boat. But, before we set out, I wished to erect a sort of\r\nfortification at the pass of the rock, for the double purpose of\r\nsecuring us against the attacks of wild beasts or of savages, and for\r\nkeeping enclosed, in the savannah beyond the rocks, some young pigs,\r\nthat we wished to multiply there, out of the way of our fields and\r\nplantations.\r\n\r\nAs we crossed the sugar-cane plantation, I saw some bamboos larger than\r\nany I had ever met with, and we cut down one for a mast to our canoe. We\r\nnow had the river to our left, and the chain of rocks to our right,\r\nwhich here approached the river, leaving only a narrow pass. At the\r\nnarrowest part of this we raised a rampart before a deep ditch, which\r\ncould only be crossed by a drawbridge we placed there. Beyond the\r\nbridge, we put a narrow gate of woven bamboos, to enable us to enter the\r\ncountry beyond, when we wished. We planted the side of the rampart with\r\ndwarf palms, India fig, and other thorny shrubs, making a winding path\r\nthrough the plantation, and digging in the midst a hidden pitfall, known\r\nto ourselves by four low posts, intended to support a plank bridge when\r\nwe wished to cross it. After this was completed, we built a little\r\n_chalet_ of bark in that part of the plantation that faced the stream,\r\nand gave it the name of the Hermitage, intending it for a\r\nresting-place. After several days of hard labour, we returned to\r\nProspect Hill, and took a little relaxation. The only work we did was to\r\nprepare the mast, and lay it on the sledge with the rest.\r\n\r\nThe next morning we returned to Tent House, where we immediately set to\r\nwork on our canoe with such diligence that it was soon completed. It was\r\nsolid and elegant, lined through with wood, and furnished with a keel.\r\nWe provided it with brass rings for the oars, and stays for the mast.\r\nInstead of ballast, I laid at the bottom a layer of stones covered with\r\nclay, and over this a flooring of boards. The benches for the rowers\r\nwere laid across, and in the midst the bamboo mast rose majestically,\r\nwith a triangular sail. Behind I fixed the rudder, worked by a tiller;\r\nand I could boast now of having built a capital canoe.\r\n\r\nOur fleet was now in good condition. For distant excursions we could\r\ntake the pinnace, but the canoe would be invaluable for the\r\ncoasting service.\r\n\r\nOur cow had, in the mean time, given us a young male calf, which I\r\nundertook to train for service, as I had done the buffalo, beginning by\r\npiercing its nostrils; and the calf promised to be docile and useful;\r\nand, as each of the other boys had his favourite animal to ride, I\r\nbestowed the bull on Francis, and intrusted him with its education, to\r\nencourage him to habits of boldness and activity. He was delighted with\r\nhis new charger, and chose to give him the name of Valiant.\r\n\r\nWe had still two months before the rainy season, and this time we\r\ndevoted to completing the comforts of our grotto. We made all the\r\npartitions of wood, except those which divided us from the stables,\r\nwhich we built of stone, to exclude any smell from the animals. We soon\r\nacquired skill in our works; we had a plentiful supply of beams and\r\nplanks from the ship; and by practice we became very good plasterers. We\r\ncovered the floors with a sort of well-beaten mud, smoothed it, and it\r\ndried perfectly hard. We then contrived a sort of felt carpet. We first\r\ncovered the floor with sailcloth; we spread over this wool and goats’\r\nhair mixed, and poured over it isinglass dissolved, rolling up the\r\ncarpet, and beating it well. When this was dry, we repeated the process,\r\nand in the end had a felt carpet. We made one of these for each room, to\r\nguard against any damp that we might be subject to in the rainy season.\r\n\r\nThe privations we had suffered the preceding winter increased the\r\nenjoyment of our present comforts. The rainy season came on; we had now\r\na warm, well lighted, convenient habitation, and abundance of excellent\r\nprovision for ourselves and our cattle. In the morning, we could attend\r\nto their wants without trouble, for the rain-water, carefully collected\r\nin clean vessels, prevented the necessity of going to the river. We then\r\nassembled in the dining-room to prayers. After that we went to our\r\nwork-room. My wife took her wheel, or her loom, which was a rude\r\nconstruction of mine, but in which she had contrived to weave some\r\nuseful cloth of wool and cotton, and also some linen, which she had made\r\nup for us. Everybody worked; the workshop was never empty. I contrived,\r\nwith the wheel of a gun, to arrange a sort of lathe, by means of which\r\nI and my sons produced some neat furniture and utensils. Ernest\r\nsurpassed us all in this art, and made some elegant little things for\r\nhis mother.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, our evening occupations commenced; our room was lighted up\r\nbrilliantly; we did not spare our candles, which were so easily\r\nprocured, and we enjoyed the reflection in the elegant crystals above\r\nus. We had partitioned off a little chapel in one corner of the grotto,\r\nwhich we had left untouched, and nothing could be more magnificent than\r\nthis chapel lighted up, with its colonnades, portico, and altars. We had\r\ndivine service here every Sunday. I had erected a sort of pulpit, from\r\nwhich I delivered a short sermon to my congregation, which I endeavoured\r\nto render as simple and as instructive as possible.\r\n\r\nJack and Francis had a natural taste for music. I made them flageolets\r\nof reeds, on which they acquired considerable skill. They accompanied\r\ntheir mother, who had a very good voice; and this music in our lofty\r\ngrotto had a charming effect.\r\n\r\nWe had thus made great steps towards civilization; and, though\r\ncondemned, perhaps, to pass our lives alone on this unknown shore, we\r\nmight yet be happy. We were placed in the midst of abundance. We were\r\nactive, industrious, and content; blessed with health, and united by\r\naffection, our minds seemed to enlarge and improve every day. We saw\r\naround us on every side traces of the Divine wisdom and beneficence; and\r\nour hearts overflowed with love and veneration for that Almighty hand\r\nwhich had so miraculously saved, and continued to protect us. I humbly\r\ntrusted in Him, either to restore us to the world, or send some beings\r\nto join us in this beloved island, where for two years we had seen no\r\ntrace of man. To Him we committed our fate. We were happy and tranquil,\r\nlooking with resignation to the future.\r\n\r\nEND OF THE FIRST PART OF THE JOURNAL.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT BY THE EDITOR.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to explain how this first part of the journal of the\r\nSwiss pastor came into my hands.\r\n\r\nThree or four years after the family had been cast on this desert coast,\r\nwhere, as we see, they lived a happy and contented life, an English\r\ntransport was driven by a storm upon the same shore. This vessel was the\r\n_Adventurer_, Captain Johnson, and was returning from New Zealand to the\r\neastern coast of North America, by Otaheite, to fetch a cargo of furs\r\nfor China, and then to proceed from Canton to England. A violent storm,\r\nwhich lasted several days, drove them out of their course. For many days\r\nthey wandered in unknown seas, and the ship was so injured by the storm,\r\nthat the captain looked out for some port to repair it. They discovered\r\na rocky coast, and, as the violence of the wind was lulled, ventured to\r\napproach the shore. At a short distance they anchored, and sent a boat\r\nto examine the coast. Lieutenant Bell, who went with the boat, knew a\r\nlittle German. They were some time before they could venture to land\r\namong the rocks which guarded the island, but, turning the promontory,\r\nthey saw Safety Bay, and entering it, were astonished to see a handsome\r\npinnace and boat at anchor, near the strand a tent, and in the rock\r\ndoors and windows, like those of a European house.\r\n\r\nThey landed, and saw a middle-aged man coming to meet them, clothed in\r\nEuropean fashion, and well armed. After a friendly salutation, they\r\nfirst spoke in German and then in English. This was the good father; the\r\nfamily were at Falcon’s Nest, where they were spending the summer. He\r\nhad seen the vessel in the morning through his telescope, but, unwilling\r\nto alarm, or to encourage hopes that might be vain, he had not spoken of\r\nit, but come alone towards the coast.\r\n\r\nAfter much friendly conference, the party were regaled with all\r\nhospitality at Tent House, the good Swiss gave the Lieutenant this first\r\npart of his journal for the perusal of Captain Johnson, and, after an\r\nhour’s conversation, they separated, hoping to have a pleasant\r\nmeeting next day.\r\n\r\nBut Heaven decreed it otherwise. During the night, another fearful storm\r\narose; the _Adventurer_ lost its anchor, and was driven out to sea; and,\r\nafter several days of anxiety and danger, found itself so far from the\r\nisland, and so much shattered, that all thoughts of returning were given\r\nup for that time, and Captain Johnson reluctantly relinquished the hope\r\nof rescuing the interesting family.\r\n\r\nThus it happened that the first part of this journal was brought to\r\nEngland, and from thence sent to me, a friend of the family, in\r\nSwitzerland, accompanied by a letter from the Captain, declaring, that\r\nhe could have no rest till he found, and became acquainted with, this\r\nhappy family; that he would search for the island in his future voyages,\r\nand either bring away the family, or, if they preferred to remain, he\r\nwould send out from England some colonists, and everything that might be\r\nnecessary to promote their comfort. A rough map of the island is added\r\nto the journal, executed by Fritz, the eldest son.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTINUATION OF THE JOURNAL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nI left the reader at the moment in which I had placed the first part of\r\nmy journal in the hands of Lieutenant Bell, to deliver to Captain\r\nJohnson, of the English vessel the _Adventurer_, expecting him to return\r\nthe next day with Lieutenant Bell. We separated in this hope, and I\r\nthought it necessary to inform my family of this expected visit, which\r\nmight decide their future lot. My wife and elder sons might wish to\r\nseize this only occasion that might occur to revisit their native\r\ncountry—to quit their beloved island, which would doubtless cost them\r\nmuch sorrow at the last moment, but was necessary to their future\r\ncomfort. I could not help feeling distressed at the prospect of my dear\r\nchildren’s solitary old age, and I determined, if they did not wish to\r\nreturn with Captain Johnson, to request him to send some colonists out\r\nto people our island.\r\n\r\nIt will be remembered that I had left home alone, and at an early hour,\r\nhaving perceived a vessel from the top of our tree with my telescope. I\r\nhad set out without breakfast, without giving my sons their tasks, or\r\nmaking any arrangements for the labours of the day. My conference with\r\nLieutenant Bell had been long; it was now past noon, and knowing how\r\nprompt my wife was to alarm herself, I was surprised that I did not\r\nmeet her, nor any of my sons. I began to be uneasy, and on my arrival I\r\nhastily mounted the tree, and found my faithful partner extended on her\r\nbed, surrounded by her four sons, and apparently in great pain. I\r\ndemanded, with a cry of grief, what had happened; all wished to speak at\r\nonce, and it was with some difficulty I learned, that my dear wife, in\r\ndescending the staircase, had been seized with a giddiness in her head,\r\nand had fallen down and injured herself so much, that she was unable to\r\nrise without assistance; she was now enduring great pain in her right\r\nleg and in her left foot. “Ernest and I,” added Fritz, “carried her\r\nwithout delay to her bed, though not without difficulty, for the\r\nstaircase is so narrow; but she continued to get worse, and we did not\r\nknow what to do.”\r\n\r\n_Jack_. I have rubbed her foot continually, but it swells more and more,\r\nas well as her leg, which I dare not touch, it hurts her so much.\r\n\r\n_Ernest_. I remember, father, that of the chests that we brought from\r\nthe ship there is one unopened, which is marked “_medicines_,”—may it\r\nnot contain something that will relieve mamma?\r\n\r\n_Father_. Perhaps it may, my son. You did well to remember it; we will\r\ngo to Tent House for it. Fritz, you shall accompany me to assist in\r\nbringing it.\r\n\r\nI wished to be alone with Fritz, to consult him about the English\r\nvessel, and was glad of this opportunity. Before I left my wife, I\r\nintended to examine her leg and foot, which were exceedingly painful.\r\nWhen I was preparing to enter the Church, I had studied medicine and\r\npractical surgery, in order to be able to administer to the bodily\r\nafflictions of my poor parishioners, as well as to their spiritual\r\nsorrows. I knew how to bleed, and could replace a dislocated limb. I had\r\noften made cures; but since my arrival at the island I had neglected my\r\nmedical studies, which happily had not been needed. I hoped now,\r\nhowever, to recall as much of my knowledge as would be sufficient to\r\ncure my poor wife. I examined her foot first, which I found to be\r\nviolently sprained. She begged me then to look at her leg, and what was\r\nmy distress when I saw it was fractured above the ankle; however, the\r\nfracture appeared simple, without splinters, and easy to cure. I sent\r\nFritz without delay to procure me two pieces of the bark of a tree,\r\nbetween which I placed the leg, after having, with the assistance of my\r\nson, stretched it till the two pieces of broken bone united; I then\r\nbound it with bandages of linen, and tied the pieces of bark round the\r\nleg, so that it might not be moved. I bound the sprained foot very\r\ntightly, till I could procure the balsam which I expected to find in the\r\nchest. I felt assured, that the giddiness of the head, which had caused\r\nher fall, proceeded from some existing cause, which I suspected, from\r\nthe pulse and the complexion, must be a fulness of blood; and it\r\nappeared to be necessary to take away some ounces, which I persuaded her\r\nto allow me to do, when I should have brought my medicine-chest and\r\ninstruments from Tent House. I left her, with many charges, to the care\r\nof my three younger sons, and proceeded to Tent House with Fritz, to\r\nwhom I now related my morning adventure, and consulted him how we should\r\nmention it to his mother. Fritz was astonished. I saw how his mind was\r\nemployed; he looked round on our fields and plantations, increasing and\r\nprospering.\r\n\r\n“We must not tell her, father,” said he. “I will be at Tent House early\r\nin the morning; you must give me some commission to execute; I will\r\nawait the arrival of the Captain, and tell him that my dear mother is\r\nill,—and that he may return as he came.”\r\n\r\n“You speak rashly, Fritz,” answered I. “I have told you that this ship\r\nhas suffered much from the storm, and needs repairs. Have you not often\r\nread the golden rule of our divine Master, _Do unto others as you would\r\nhave others do unto you?_ Our duty is to receive the Captain into our\r\nisland, and to assist him in repairing and refitting his vessel.”\r\n\r\n“And he will find,” said he, “we know something of that kind of work.\r\nDid you show him our beautiful pinnace and canoe? But can such a large\r\nvessel enter our Bay of Safety?”\r\n\r\n“No,” replied I; “I fear there will not be sufficient water; but we will\r\nshow the captain the large bay at the other end of the island, formed by\r\nCape Disappointment; he will find there a beautiful harbour.”\r\n\r\n“And he and his officers may live at the farm, and we can go over every\r\nday to assist in repairing their vessel,” continued Fritz.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said I; “and when it is finished, he will, in return, give\r\nus a place in it to return to Europe.”\r\n\r\n“To return to Europe, father!” cried he; “to leave our beautiful winter\r\ndwelling, Tent House, and our charming summer residence, Falcon’s Nest;\r\nour dear, good animals; our crystals of salt; our farms; so much that is\r\nour own, and which nobody covets, to return into Europe to poverty, to\r\nwar, to those wicked soldiers who have banished us! We want nothing.\r\nDear father, can you consent to leave our beloved island?”\r\n\r\n“You are right, my dear son,” said I. “Would to God we might always\r\nremain here happily together; but we are of different ages, and by the\r\nlaw of nature we must one day be separated. Consider, my dear son, if\r\nyou should survive your brothers, how cheerless it would be to live\r\nquite alone on this desert island, without any one to close your eyes.\r\nBut let us look at these trees; I see they are tamarind-trees; their\r\nfruit contains a pulp which is very useful in medicine, and which will\r\nsuit your mother, I think, as well as the juice of the orange or lemon.\r\nWe shall find some of the latter at our plantation near Tent House; but,\r\nin the mean time, do you climb the tamarind-tree, and gather some of\r\nthose pods which resemble those of beans, fill one side of the bag with\r\nthem, the other we will reserve for the oranges and lemons. Not to lose\r\nany time, I will go on to Tent House to seek for the two chests, and you\r\ncan follow me.”\r\n\r\nFritz was up the tamarind-tree in a moment. I crossed Family Bridge, and\r\nsoon reached the grotto. I lighted a candle, which I always kept ready,\r\nentered the magazine, and found the two chests, labelled.\r\n\r\nThey were neither large nor heavy, and, having tied cords round them for\r\nthe convenience of carrying them, I proceeded to visit the orange and\r\nlemon trees, where I found the fruit sufficiently ripe for lemonade.\r\nFritz came to meet me, with a good supply of tamarinds. We filled the\r\nother end of his sack with oranges and lemons. He threw it over his\r\nshoulder, and, neither of us being overloaded, we pursued our way\r\nhomewards very quickly, notwithstanding the heat, which was excessively\r\noppressive, though the sun was hidden under the thick clouds, which\r\nentirely concealed the sea from us. Nothing was to be seen but the waves\r\nbreaking against the rocks. Fritz expressed his fears that a storm was\r\ncoming on, which might prove fatal to the vessel, and wished to take out\r\nthe pinnace and endeavour to assist Captain Johnson. Delighted as I felt\r\nwith his fearless humanity, I could not consent; I reminded him of the\r\nsituation of his mother. “Forgive me, dear father,” said he; “I had\r\nforgotten everything but the poor vessel. But the captain may do as we\r\ndid, leave his ship between the rocks, and come, with all in the vessel,\r\nto establish themselves here. We will give them up a corner of our\r\nislands; and if there should be any ladies amongst them, how pleasant it\r\nwould be for mamma to have a friend!”\r\n\r\nThe rain now fell in torrents, and we proceeded with great difficulty.\r\nAfter crossing the bridge, we saw at a distance a very extraordinary\r\nfigure approaching us; we could not ascertain what species of animal it\r\nwas. It appeared taller than any of the monkeys we had seen, and much\r\nlarger, of a black or brown colour. We could not distinguish the head,\r\nbut it seemed to have two thick and moveable horns before it. We had\r\nfortunately taken no gun with us, or Fritz would certainly have fired\r\nat this singular animal. But as it rapidly approached us, we soon\r\nrecognized the step, and the cry of pleasure which hailed us. “It is\r\nJack,” we exclaimed; and in fact it was he, who was hurrying to meet us\r\nwith my large cloak and waterproof caoutchouc boots. I had neglected to\r\ntake them, and my dear little fellow had volunteered to bring them to\r\nTent House. To protect himself on the way, he had put the cloak on,\r\ncovering his head with the hood, and my boots being too large for him,\r\nhe had put one on each arm, which he held up to secure the hood.\r\nConceive what a singular figure he made. Notwithstanding our uneasiness,\r\nand our wretched condition, for we were wet to the skin, we could not\r\nbut laugh heartily at him. I would not consent to use the coverings he\r\nhad brought; neither Fritz nor I could be worse for the distance we had\r\nto go, and Jack was younger and more delicate; I obliged him therefore\r\nto retain his curious protection; and asked how he had left his mother.\r\n“Very uneasy,” said he, “about you; else I think she must be much\r\nbetter, for her cheeks are very red, and her eyes very bright, and she\r\ntalks incessantly. She would have come herself to seek you, but could\r\nnot rise; and when I told her I would come, she bid me be very quick;\r\nbut when I was coming down stairs, I heard her call me back for fear of\r\nthe rain and the thunder; I would not hear her, but ran as fast as I\r\ncould, hoping to reach Tent House. Why did you come back so soon?”\r\n\r\n“To spare you half your journey, my brave little man,” said I, hastening\r\non; for Jack’s account of his mother made me uneasy. I perceived she\r\nmust be labouring under fever, and the blood ascending to her head. My\r\nchildren followed me, and we soon reached the foot of our castle in\r\nthe air.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe entered our apartment literally as if we had come out of the sea, and\r\nI found my poor Elizabeth much agitated. “Heaven be praised!” said she;\r\n“but where is Jack, that rash little fellow?”\r\n\r\n“Here I am, mamma,” said he, “as dry as when I left you. I have left my\r\ndress below, that I might not terrify you; for if Mr. Fritz had had his\r\ngun, I might have been shot as a _rhinoceros_, and not been here to tell\r\nyou my story.”\r\n\r\nThe good mother then turned her thoughts on Fritz and me, and would not\r\nsuffer us to come near her till we had changed our drenched garments. To\r\noblige her, we retired to a little closet I had contrived between two\r\nthick branches at the top of the staircase, which was used to contain\r\nour chests of linen, our dresses, and our provisions. Our dress was soon\r\nchanged; we hung up the wet garments, and I returned to my companion,\r\nwho was suffering from her foot, but still more from a frightful\r\nheadache. She had a burning fever. I concluded that bleeding was\r\nurgently needed, but commenced by assuaging her thirst with some\r\nlemonade. I then opened my box of surgical instruments, and approached\r\nthe opening to the east which served us for a window, and which we\r\ncould close by means of a curtain, that was now entirely raised to give\r\nair to our dear invalid, and to amuse my children, who were watching the\r\nstorm. The mighty waves that broke against the rocks, the vivid\r\nlightning bursting through the castles of murky clouds, the majestic and\r\nincessant rolling of the thunder, formed one of those enchanting\r\nspectacles to which they had been from infancy accustomed. As in the\r\nSwiss mountains we are liable to frightful storms, to which it is\r\nnecessary to familiarize oneself, as one cannot avoid them, I had\r\naccustomed my wife and children, by my own example, to behold, not only\r\nwithout fear, but even with admiration, these great shocks of the\r\nelements,—these convulsions of nature.\r\n\r\nI had opened the chest, and my children had directed their attention to\r\nthe instruments it contained; the first were a little rusty, and I\r\nhanded them to Ernest, who, after examining them, placed them on a table\r\ninside the window. I was searching for a lancet in good condition, when\r\na clap of thunder, such as I had never heard in my life, terrified us\r\nall so much, that we nearly fell down. This burst of thunder had not\r\nbeen preceded by any lightning, but was accompanied by two immense\r\nforked columns of fire, which seemed to stretch from the sky to our very\r\nfeet. We all cried out, even my poor wife; but the silence of terror\r\nsucceeded, and seemed to be the silence of death. I flew to the bedside,\r\nand found my dear patient in a state of total insensibility. I was\r\nconvinced that she was dead, and I was dumb with despair. I was roused\r\nfrom my stupor by the voice of my children. I then remembered that I\r\nhad not lost all: there still remained duties to fulfil, and affection\r\nto console me. “My children,” cried I, extending my arms to them, “come\r\nand comfort your unfortunate father: come and lament with him the best\r\nof wives and mothers.” Terrified at the appearance of their mother, they\r\nsurrounded her bed, calling on her in piercing accents. At that moment I\r\nsaw my little Francis was missing, and my grief was augmented by the\r\nfear that he had been killed by the lightning. I hastily turned to the\r\nwindow, expecting to find my child dead, and our dwelling in flames.\r\nFortunately, all was safe; but, in my distraction, I scarcely thanked\r\nGod for His mercy, at the very moment even when he graciously restored\r\nto me my lost treasures. Francis, frightened by the storm, had hidden\r\nhimself in his mother’s bed, and fallen asleep; awaked by the thunder,\r\nhe had not dared to move, fearing it announced the arrival of the\r\nsavages; but at last, the cries of his brothers roused him, and raising\r\nhis pretty fair head, supposing his mother sleeping, he flung his arms\r\nround her neck, saying, “Wake, mamma, we are all here,—papa, my\r\nbrothers, and the storm, too, which is very beautiful, but frightens me.\r\nOpen your eyes, mamma; look at the bright lightning, and kiss your\r\nlittle Francis.” Either his sweet voice, or the cries of her elder\r\nchildren, restored her faculties: she gradually recovered, and called me\r\nto her. The excess of my joy threatened to be almost as fatal as my\r\ngrief. With difficulty I controlled my own feelings and those of my\r\nboys; and, after I had sent them from the bed, I ascertained that she\r\nwas not only really living, but much better. The pulse was calm, and\r\nthe fever had subsided, leaving only a weakness that was by no means\r\nalarming. I relinquished, joyfully, the intention of bleeding her, the\r\nnecessity of which I had trembled to contemplate, and contented myself\r\nwith employing the boys to prepare a cooling mixture, composed of the\r\njuice of the lemon, of barley, and tamarinds, which they completed to\r\nthe great satisfaction of their mother. I then ordered Fritz to descend\r\nto the yard, to kill a fowl, pluck and boil it, to make broth,—a\r\nwholesome and light nourishment for our dear invalid. I told one of his\r\nbrothers to assist him, and Jack and Francis, frequently employed under\r\ntheir mother, were ready in a moment. Ernest alone remained quietly on\r\nhis seat, which I attributed to his usual indolence, and tried to make\r\nhim ashamed of it. “Ernest,” said I, “you are not very anxious to oblige\r\nyour mother; you sit as if the thunderbolt had struck you.”\r\n\r\n“It has, indeed, rendered me unfit to be of any service to my good\r\nmother,” said he, quietly; and, drawing his right hand from under his\r\nwaistcoat, he showed it to me, most frightfully black and burnt.\r\n\r\nThis dear child, who must have suffered very much, had never uttered a\r\ncomplaint, for fear of alarming his mother; and even now he made a sign\r\nto me to be silent, lest she should hear, and discover the truth. She\r\nsoon, however, fell into a sleep, which enabled me to attend to poor\r\nErnest, and to question him about the accident. I learned that a long\r\nand pointed steel instrument, which he was examining near the large\r\nwindow, stooping over it to see it better, had attracted the lightning,\r\nwhich, falling partly on the hand in which he held it, had caused the\r\nmisfortune. There were traces on his arm of the electric fire, and his\r\nhair was burnt on one side. By what miracle the electric fluid had been\r\ndiverted, and how we, dwelling in a tree, had been preserved from a\r\nsudden and general conflagration, I knew not. My son assured me he had\r\nseen the fire run along the instrument he held, and from thence fall\r\nperpendicularly to the earth, where it seemed to burst with a second\r\nexplosion. I was impatient to examine this phenomenon, and to see if any\r\nother traces were left, except those on the hand of my son, which it was\r\nnecessary, in the first place, to attend to. I remembered frequently to\r\nhave applied with success in burns the most simple and easy of remedies,\r\nwhich everybody can command: this is, to bathe the hand affected in cold\r\nwater, taking care to renew it every eight or ten minutes. I placed\r\nErnest between two tubs of cold water, and, exhorting him to patience\r\nand perseverance, I left him to bathe his hand, and approached the\r\nopening, to try and discover what had preserved us, by averting the\r\ndirection of the lightning, which one might have expected would have\r\nkilled my son, and destroyed our dwelling. I saw only some light traces\r\non the table; but, on looking more attentively, I found that the greater\r\npart of the surgical instruments which Ernest had placed upon it were\r\neither melted or much damaged. In examining them separately, I remarked\r\none much longer than the rest, which projected beyond the edge of the\r\ntable, and was much marked by the fire. I could not easily take it up;\r\nit had adhered somewhat in melting, and, in endeavouring to disengage\r\nit, I saw that the point, which was beyond the opening, touched a thick\r\nwire, which seemed to be suspended from the roof of our tent. All was\r\nnow explained to me; except that I could in no way account for this\r\nwire, placed expressly to serve as a conductor for the lightning. It\r\nseemed to be the work of magic. The evening was too far advanced for me\r\nto distinguish how it was fastened, and what fixed it below; therefore,\r\nenjoining Ernest to call loudly if he needed me, I hastened down. I saw\r\nmy three cooks very busy, as I passed through, preparing the broth for\r\ntheir mother—they assured me it would be excellent. Fritz boasted that\r\nhe had killed the fowl with all speed, Jack that he had plucked it\r\nwithout tearing it much, and Francis that he had lighted and kept up the\r\nfire. They had nothing to employ them just then, and I took them with me\r\nto have some one to talk to on the phenomenon of the lightning. Below\r\nthe window I found a large packet of iron wire, which I had brought from\r\nTent House some days before, intending on some leisure day to make a\r\nsort of grating before our poultry-yard. By what chance was it here, and\r\nhooked by one end to the roof of our house? Some time before I had\r\nreplaced our cloth canopy by a sort of roof covered with bark nailed\r\nupon laths; the cloth still enclosed the sides and front; all was so\r\ninflammable, that, but for the providential conductor, we must have been\r\nin flames in an instant. I thanked God for our preservation; and little\r\nFrancis, seeing me so happy, said—\r\n\r\n“Is it quite true, papa, that this wire has preserved us?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it is true, my darling; and I wish to know what good genius has\r\nplaced it there, that I may be thankful,” said I.\r\n\r\n“Ah! father,” said my little fellow, “embrace me, but do not thank me;\r\nfor I did not know that I was doing good.”\r\n\r\nAstonished at this information, I requested my boy to tell me why and\r\nhow he had fixed the wire?\r\n\r\n“I wanted to reach some figs,” said he, “when you and Fritz were at Tent\r\nHouse, and Jack and Ernest were nursing mamma; I wished to do some good\r\nfor her. I thought she would like some of our sweet figs; but there were\r\nnone in my reach, and I had no stick long enough to beat them down. I\r\nwent below, and found that great roll of wire. I tried to break a piece\r\noff, but could not; and I then determined to carry the whole up to our\r\ndwelling, and to bend one end into a hook, by which I might catch some\r\nof the branches, and bring them near me to gather the figs. I was very\r\nsuccessful at first, and secured one or two figs. I had my packet of\r\nwire on the table by the window, and stood near it myself. I thought I\r\ncould reach a branch that hung over our roof, loaded with fruit. I\r\nleaned forward, and extended my hook to the branch; I felt I had secured\r\nit, and joyfully began to pull. You know, papa, they bend, and don’t\r\nbreak; but it remained immovable, as well as my hook, which was held by\r\none of the laths of the roof. I pulled with all my strength, and, in my\r\nefforts, I struck my foot against the roll of wire, which fell down to\r\nthe ground without detaching the hook. You may judge how firm it is, for\r\nit is no trifling leap from our house to the ground.”\r\n\r\n“A good work, indeed, my boy,” said I, “is yours, for it has saved us.\r\nGod has inspired you, and has made use of the hand of a child for our\r\npreservation. Your conductor shall remain where you have so happily\r\nplaced it; we may still have need of it. The sky still looks very\r\nthreatening; let us return to your mother, and take a light with us.”\r\n\r\nI had contrived a sort of portable lantern, made of isinglass, which\r\nlighted us in our offices. Moreover, a calibash pierced with small\r\nholes, with a candle inside, was placed at the top of the winding\r\nstaircase, and lighted it entirely, so that we were able to descend\r\nwithout danger by night as w ell as by day. I was, however, uneasy about\r\nthe way we should bring my wife down, if we found it necessary to remove\r\nher during her sickness; I named it to Fritz.\r\n\r\n“Have no uneasiness, father,” said he, “Ernest and I are very strong\r\nnow, and we can carry mamma like a feather.”\r\n\r\n“You and I might, my dear boy,” said I; “but Ernest cannot be of much\r\nassistance to us at present.”\r\n\r\nI then related his misfortune to them. They were distressed and\r\nastonished, not comprehending the cause, which I promised to explain.\r\nThey wished now, however, to see their brother. Fritz then requested, in\r\na low tone of voice, that he might go to Tent House, to see if the\r\nvessel and the captain had arrived. Seeing his brothers listening with\r\ncuriosity, I thought it best to tell them the affair, requesting them,\r\nhowever, not to name it to their mother at present. Jack, who was now\r\nabout fourteen years of age, listened with the most intense interest,\r\nhis eyes sparkling with joy and surprise.\r\n\r\n“A vessel!—people from Europe! Do you think they have come to seek us?\r\nPerhaps they are our relations and friends.”\r\n\r\n“How glad should I be,” said Francis, “if my good grandmamma were there;\r\nshe loved me so much, and was always giving me sweetmeats.” This was the\r\nmother of my dear wife, from whom she had parted with extreme regret; I\r\nknew that a single word from the child would have revived all her\r\nsorrows, and would in her present state be dangerous. I therefore\r\nforbade him naming such a thing to his mother, even if we mentioned\r\nthe vessel.\r\n\r\nWe ascended, and found our dear patient awake, with Ernest at her side,\r\nhis hand tied up, and somewhat relieved; though, from not having applied\r\nthe water immediately, there were several blisters, which he requested\r\nme to open. It was necessary to tell his mother he had had a burn; she\r\nnamed several remedies, and I was hesitating which to use, when Fritz,\r\ngiving me a significant glance, said, “Don’t you think, father, that the\r\nleaves of the karata, which cured Jack’s leg so well, would be as\r\nserviceable to Ernest’s hand?”\r\n\r\n“I have no doubt of it,” said I; “but we have none here.”\r\n\r\n“I know very well where they grow,” said he. “Come, Jack, we shall soon\r\nbe there; we shall have a little rain, but what of that? we shall not be\r\nmelted, and we can have a bath.”\r\n\r\nMy wife was divided between her desire to relieve Ernest, and her fear\r\nof the boys venturing out in such a stormy night. She agreed at last,\r\nprovided Jack had my cloak, and Fritz the boots, and that they should\r\ntake the lantern. Thus equipped, they set out; I accompanied them\r\noutside the tree; Fritz assuring me they would be back in three hours,\r\nat most. He intended to proceed along the rocks towards Tent House, to\r\nmake what observations he could; for, as he told me, he could not get\r\nthe poor captain and his vessel out of his head. It was now seven\r\no’clock; I gave them my blessing, and left them with injunctions to be\r\nprudent, and returned with an anxious heart to my invalids.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn entering, I found Francis sitting on his mother’s bed, telling her\r\nthe story of the lightning, of the wire which was called _a conductor_,\r\nof the figs that he was going to gather for her, and that papa had\r\ncalled him—little Francis—_the preserver of the whole family_. Having\r\nbriefly explained to them the results of Francis’s fortunate device, I\r\nprocured some raw potato to apply to Ernest’s hand, which still gave him\r\ngreat pain, and bathed my wife’s foot with some _eau d’arquebusade_,\r\nwhich I procured from my medicine-chest; here I also met with some\r\nlaudanum, a few drops of which I infused into the lemonade, wishing her\r\nto sleep till her sons returned. She soon was in a sweet slumber; the\r\nboys followed her example, and I was left alone with my anxieties;\r\nhappy, however, to see them at rest after such an evening of agitation.\r\nThe hours passed, still my children returned not. I was continually at\r\nthe window, listening for their steps or the sound of their voices; I\r\nheard only the rain falling in torrents, the waves breaking against the\r\nrocks, and the wind howling frightfully. I could not help thinking of\r\nthe danger they ran, having twice to cross the river, which was\r\ndoubtless swollen by the rain. I was not so much alarmed for Fritz, a\r\nstrong, bold youth of nineteen years of age, and a determined hunter: as\r\nfor poor Jack, bold even to rashness, and having neither strength nor\r\nexperience to secure him, I could not help fancying him carried away by\r\nthe stream, and his brother not daring to return without him. My wife\r\noccasionally awoke, but the narcotic stupified her; she did not perceive\r\nthe absence of her sons. Francis slept tranquilly; but when Ernest\r\nawoke, and heard the tempest so terribly augmented, he was almost\r\ndistracted; all his selfishness, all his indolence disappeared. He\r\nentreated me to allow him to go in search of his brothers, and with\r\ndifficulty I detained him. To convince him that he was not the sole\r\ncause of the danger of Fritz and Jack, I related to him, for the first\r\ntime, the history of the boat and the vessel, and assured him that the\r\ngreat cause of their anxiety to go over to Tent House, was to search for\r\nsome traces of the unfortunate seamen and their vessel, exposed to that\r\nfurious sea.\r\n\r\n“And Fritz, also, is exposed to that sea,” cried Ernest. “I know it; I\r\nam sure that he is at this moment in his canoe, struggling against\r\nthe waves!”\r\n\r\n“And Jack, my poor Jack!” sighed I, infected with his fears.\r\n\r\n“No, father,” added Ernest; “be composed; Fritz will not be so\r\nimprudent; he will have left Jack in our house at the rock; and,\r\nprobably, seeing the hopelessness of his undertaking, he is returned\r\nhimself now, and is waiting there till the stream subsides a little; do\r\nallow me to go, dear father; you have ordered me cold water for my burnt\r\nhand, and it will certainly cure it to get well wet.”\r\n\r\nI could not consent to expose my third son to the tempest, which was now\r\nbecome frightful; the sailcloth which covered our window was torn into a\r\nthousand pieces, and carried away; the rain, like a deluge, forced\r\nitself into our dwelling, even to the bed where my wife and child were\r\nlying. I could neither make up my mind to leave them myself in this\r\nperilous situation, nor to spare my boy, who could not even be of any\r\nuse to his brothers. I commanded him to remain, succeeded in persuading\r\nhim of their probable safety, and induced him to lie down to rest. Now,\r\nin my terrible solitude, I turned to Him, “who tempers the wind to the\r\nshorn lamb;” who forbids us not to address Him in the trials he sends\r\nus, to beseech Him to soften them, or to give us strength to bear them.\r\nKneeling down, I dared to supplicate Him to restore me my children,\r\nsubmissively adding, after the example of our blessed Saviour, “Yet, not\r\nmy will, but thine be done, O Lord.”\r\n\r\nMy prayers appeared to be heard; the storm gradually abated, and the day\r\nbegan to break. I awoke Ernest, and having dressed his wounded hand, he\r\nset out for Tent House, in search of his brothers. I followed him with\r\nmy eyes as far as I could see; the whole country appeared one vast lake,\r\nand the road to Tent House was like the bed of a river; but, protected\r\nby his good gaiters of buffalo-skin, he proceeded fearlessly, and was\r\nsoon out of my sight.\r\n\r\nI was recalled from the window by the voice of my wife, who was awake,\r\nand anxiously inquiring for her sons.\r\n\r\n“They are gone,” said I, “to gather the leaves of the karata for\r\nErnest’s burnt hand, and he wished to go too.”\r\n\r\nHer deep sleep had entirely chased from her memory all the events of the\r\nprevious evening, and I was glad to allow Francis to repeat his little\r\ntale of the burn and his _conductor_ in order to gain time. She was\r\nastonished and uneasy to hear of Ernest’s accident, and was afraid they\r\nwould _get wet_ in searching for the karata, little aware of the hours\r\nof anguish I had endured waiting and watching for those she believed had\r\nonly just left home. At that moment, the dear and well-known voices were\r\nheard under the great window.\r\n\r\n“Father, I am bringing back my brothers,” cried Ernest.\r\n\r\n“Yes, papa, we are all alive, and as wet as fishes,” added the sweet\r\nvoice of Jack.\r\n\r\n“But not without having had our troubles,” said the manly voice of\r\nFritz.\r\n\r\nI rushed down the staircase to meet them, and, embracing them, I led\r\nthem, trembling with emotion, to the bed of their mother, who could not\r\ncomprehend the transport of joy I expressed.\r\n\r\n“Dear Elizabeth,” said I, “here are our sons; God has given them to us a\r\nsecond time.”\r\n\r\n“Have we then been in any danger of losing them?” said she. “What is the\r\nmeaning of this?”\r\n\r\nThey saw their mother was unconscious of their long absence, and\r\nassured her it was only the storm which had so completely wetted them,\r\nthat had alarmed me. I hastened to get them to change their clothes, and\r\ngo to bed a little while to rest themselves; as, however anxious I was\r\nmyself, I wished to prepare my wife for their recital, and also to tell\r\nher of the vessel. Jack would not go till he had produced his bundle of\r\nthe karata-leaves.\r\n\r\n“There is enough for six-and-thirty thunderstorms,” said he; “and I will\r\nprepare them. I have had some experience with my own, and I know the\r\nbest method.”\r\n\r\nHe soon divided one of the leaves with his knife, after cutting away the\r\ntriangular thorn from the end, and applied it to his brother’s hand,\r\nbinding it with his handkerchief. Having completed this dressing, he\r\nthrew off his clothes, and, jumping into his bed, he and his brothers\r\nwere sound asleep in ten minutes.\r\n\r\nI then sat down by my wife, and began my tale; from my first view of the\r\nvessel, and my anxious watching for intercourse with it, in order that\r\nwe might take the opportunity to return to Europe.\r\n\r\n“But why should we return to Europe?” said she; “we want nothing here\r\nnow, since I have got flax, cotton, and a wheel. Our children lead an\r\nactive, healthy, and innocent life, and live _with us_, which they might\r\nnot do in the world. For four years we have been happy here, and what\r\nshall we find in Europe to compensate us for what we leave\r\nhere?—poverty, war, and none of those things which we have here\r\nabundantly.”\r\n\r\n“But we should find grandmamma,” said little Francis; and stopped,\r\nrecollecting my prohibition.\r\n\r\nHe had, however, said sufficient to bring tears to his mother’s eyes.\r\n\r\n“You are right, my darling,” said she, “that is my sole regret; but my\r\ndear parent was aged and infirm, in all probability I should no longer\r\nfind her in this world; and if removed to Heaven, she watches over us in\r\nthis island, as well as if we were in Europe.”\r\n\r\nAfter my dear wife had subdued the agitation this remembrance caused\r\nher, I pursued the conversation as follows:—\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n“I see, my dear wife,” said I, “that you, as well as the rest of my\r\nfamily, are contented to remain on this island, where it seems it is the\r\nwill of God for us to dwell, as it is improbable that in such a tempest\r\nCaptain Johnson would risk approaching the island, if indeed it has not\r\nbeen already fatal to him. I am impatient to learn if Fritz has any\r\ntidings of him; for it was on the shore near Tent House that he and Jack\r\npassed the night.”\r\n\r\n“Well done, my good and courageous boys!” said their mother; “they might\r\nat any rate have given assistance to them if wrecked.”\r\n\r\n“You are more courageous than I am, my dear Elizabeth,” answered I; “I\r\nhave passed the whole night mourning for my children, and you think only\r\nof the good they might have done to their fellow-creatures.”\r\n\r\nMy sons were awake by this time, and I eagerly inquired if they had\r\ndiscovered any traces of the vessel. Fritz said they had not; but he\r\nfeared it would never be able to resist the fury of the tempest.\r\n\r\n“No, indeed,” said Jack; “those mountains of waves, which were not\r\nfixtures like other mountains, came full gallop to swallow up Fritz the\r\ngreat, Jack the little, and their fine canoe.”\r\n\r\nMy wife nearly fainted when she heard they had ventured on that terrible\r\nsea; and I reminded Fritz that I had forbidden him to do this.\r\n\r\n“But you have often said to me, papa,” said he, “do unto others as you\r\nwould they should do unto you; and what a happiness it would have been\r\nto us, when our vessel was wrecked, if we had seen a canoe!”\r\n\r\n“With two bold men coming to our assistance,” said Jack;—“but go on\r\nwith your story, Fritz.”\r\n\r\nFritz continued: “We proceeded first to the rocks, and, with some\r\ndifficulty, and not until Jack had shed some blood in the cause, we\r\nsecured the karata-leaves, with their ugly thorns at the end. When our\r\nsack was full, we proceeded along the rocks towards Tent House. From\r\nthis height I tried to discover the ship, but the darkness obscured\r\neverything. Once I thought I perceived at a great distance a fixed\r\nlight, which was neither a star nor the lightning, and which I lost\r\nsight of occasionally. We had now arrived at the cascade, which, from\r\nthe noise, seemed much swollen by the rain—our great stones were quite\r\nhidden by a boiling foam. I would have attempted to cross, if I had been\r\nalone; but, with Jack on my shoulders, I was afraid of the risk. I\r\ntherefore prepared to follow the course of the river to Family Bridge.\r\nThe wet ground continually brought us on our knees, and with great\r\ndifficulty we reached the bridge. But judge of our consternation! the\r\nriver had risen so much that the planks were covered, and, as we\r\nconceived, the whole was destroyed. I then told Jack to return to\r\nFalcon’s Nest with the karata-leaves, and I would swim across the river.\r\nI returned about a hundred yards up the stream to find a wider and less\r\nrapid part, and easily crossed. Judge of my surprise when I saw a human\r\nfigure approaching to meet me; I had no doubt it was the captain of the\r\nvessel, and—”\r\n\r\n“And it was Captain Jack, _sans peur et sans reproche_,” said the bold\r\nlittle fellow. “I was determined not to return home a poltroon who was\r\nafraid of the water.” When Fritz was gone, I tried the bridge, and soon\r\nfound there was not sufficient water over it to risk my being drowned. I\r\ntook off my boots, which might have made me slip, and my cloak, which\r\nwas too heavy, and, making a dart, I ran with all my strength across,\r\nand reached the other side. I put on my boots, which I had in my hands,\r\nand advanced to meet Fritz, who called out, as soon as he saw me, “Is it\r\nyou, captain?” I tried to say, “Yes, certainly,” in a deep tone, but my\r\nlaughter betrayed me.\r\n\r\n“To my great regret;” said Fritz, “I should truly have preferred meeting\r\nCaptain Johnson; but I fear he and his people are at the bottom of the\r\nsea. After meeting with Jack, we proceeded to Tent House, where we\r\nkindled a good fire, and dried ourselves a little. We then refreshed\r\nourselves with some wine which remained on the table where you had\r\nentertained the captain, and proceeded to prepare a signal to inform the\r\nvessel we were ready to receive them. We procured a thick bamboo cane\r\nfrom the magazine; I fixed firmly to one end of it the large lantern of\r\nthe fish’s bladder you gave us to take; I filled the lamp with oil, and\r\nplaced in it a thick cotton-wick, which, when lighted, was very\r\nbrilliant. Jack and I then placed it on the shore, at the entrance of\r\nthe bay. We fixed it before the rock, where the land-wind would not\r\nreach it, sunk it three or four feet into the ground, steadied it with\r\nstones, and then went to rest over our fire, after this long and\r\ndifficult labour. After drying ourselves a little, we set out on our\r\nreturn, when, looking towards the sea, we were startled by the\r\nappearance of the same light we had noticed before; we heard, at the\r\nsame time, the distant report of a gun, which was repeated three or four\r\ntimes at irregular intervals. We were persuaded that it was the vessel\r\ncalling to us for aid, and, remembering the command of our Saviour, we\r\nthought you would forgive our disobedience if we presented to you in the\r\nmorning the captain, the lieutenant, and as many as our canoe would\r\ncontain. We entered it then without any fear, for you know how light and\r\nwell-balanced it is; and, rowing into the bay, the sail was spread to\r\nthe wind, and we had no more trouble. I then took the helm; my own\r\nsignal-light shone clearly on the shore; and, _except_ for the rain\r\nwhich fell in torrents, the waves which washed over our canoe, and\r\nuneasiness about the ship and about you, and our fear that the wind\r\nmight carry us into the open sea, we should have had a delightful\r\nlittle maritime excursion. When we got out of the bay, I perceived the\r\nwind was driving us towards Shark’s Island, which, being directly before\r\nthe bay, forms two entrances to it. I intended to go round it, and\r\ndisembark there, if possible, that I might look out for some trace of\r\nthe ship, but we found this impossible; the sea ran too high; besides,\r\nwe should have been unable to moor our canoe, the island not affording a\r\nsingle tree or anything we could lash it to, and the waves would soon\r\nhave carried it away. We had now lost sight of the light, and hearing no\r\nmore signals, I began to think on your distress when we did not arrive\r\nat the hour we promised. I therefore resolved to return by the other\r\nside of the bay, carefully avoiding the current, which would have\r\ncarried us into the open sea. I lowered the sail by means of the ropes\r\nyou had fixed to it, and we rowed into port. We carefully moored the\r\ncanoe, and, without returning to Tent House, took the road home. We\r\ncrossed the bridge as Jack had done, found the waterproof cloak and bag\r\nof karata-leaves where he had left them, and soon after met Ernest. As\r\nit was daylight, I did not take him for the captain, but knew him\r\nimmediately, and felt the deepest remorse when I heard from him in what\r\nanxiety and anguish you had passed the night. Our enterprise was\r\nimprudent, and altogether useless; but we might have saved life, which\r\nwould have been an ample remuneration. I fear all is hopeless. What do\r\nyou think, father, of their fate?”\r\n\r\n“I hope they are far from this dangerous coast,” said I; “but if still\r\nin our neighbourhood, we will do all we can to assist them. As soon as\r\nthe tempest is subsided, we will take the pinnace and sail round the\r\nisland. You have long urged me to this, Fritz; and who knows but on the\r\nopposite side we may find some traces of our own poor sailors,—perhaps\r\neven meet with them?”\r\n\r\nThe weather gradually clearing, I called my sons to go out with me. My\r\nwife earnestly besought me not to venture on the sea; I assured her it\r\nwas not sufficiently calm, but we must examine our plantations, to\r\nascertain what damage was done, and at the same time we might look out\r\nfor some traces of the wreck; besides, our animals were becoming\r\nclamorous for food; therefore, leaving Ernest with her, we descended to\r\nadminister in the first place to their wants.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur animals were impatiently expecting us; they had been neglected\r\nduring the storm, and were ill-supplied with food, besides being\r\nhalf-sunk in water. The ducks and the flamingo liked it well enough, and\r\nwere swimming comfortably in the muddy water; but the quadrupeds were\r\ncomplaining aloud, each in his own proper language, and making a\r\nfrightful confusion of sounds. _Valiant_, especially,—the name Francis\r\nhad bestowed on the calf I had given him to bring up,—bleated\r\nincessantly for his young master, and could not be quieted till he came.\r\nIt is wonderful how this child, only twelve years old, had tamed and\r\nattached this animal; though sometimes so fierce, with him he was mild\r\nas a lamb. The boy rode on his back, guiding him with a little stick,\r\nwith which he just touched the side of his neck as he wished him to\r\nmove; but if his brothers had ventured to mount, they would have been\r\ncertainly thrown off. A pretty sight was our cavalry: Fritz on his\r\nhandsome onagra, Jack on his huge buffalo, and Francis on his young\r\nbull. There was nothing left for Ernest but the donkey, and its slow and\r\npeaceful habits suited him very well.\r\n\r\nFrancis ran up to his favourite, who showed his delight at seeing him as\r\nwell as he was able, and at the first summons followed his master from\r\nthe stable. Fritz brought out _Lightfoot_ Jack his buffalo, and I\r\nfollowed with the cow and the ass. We left them to sport about at\r\nliberty on the humid earth, till we removed the water from their stable,\r\nand supplied them with fresh food. We then drove them in, considering it\r\nadvisable to pursue our expedition on foot, lest the bridge should still\r\nbe overflowed. Francis was the superintendent of the fowls, and knew\r\nevery little chicken by name; he called them out and scattered their\r\nfood for them, and soon had his beautiful and noisy family fluttering\r\nround him.\r\n\r\nAfter having made all our animals comfortable, and given them their\r\nbreakfast, we began to think of our own. Francis made a fire and warmed\r\nsome chicken broth for his mother; for ourselves, we were contented with\r\nsome new milk, some salt herrings, and cold potatoes. I had often\r\nsearched in my excursions for the precious _bread-fruit_ tree, so highly\r\nspoken of by modern travellers, which I had hoped might be found in our\r\nisland, from its favourable situation; but I had hitherto been\r\nunsuccessful. We were unable to procure the blessing of _bread_, our\r\nship biscuit had long been exhausted, and though we had sown our\r\nEuropean corn, we had not yet reaped any.\r\n\r\nAfter we had together knelt down to thank God for his merciful\r\nprotection through the terrors of the past night, and besought him to\r\ncontinue it, we prepared to set out. The waves still ran high, though\r\nthe wind had subsided, and we determined merely to go along the shore,\r\nas the roads still continued impassable from the rain, and the sand was\r\neasier to walk on than the wet grass; besides, our principal motive for\r\nthe excursion was to search for any traces of a recent shipwreck. At\r\nfirst we could discover nothing, even with the telescope; but Fritz,\r\nmounting a high rock, fancied he discovered something floating towards\r\nthe island. He besought me to allow him to take the canoe, which was\r\nstill where he left it the preceding night. As the bridge was now easy\r\nto cross, I consented, only insisting on accompanying him to assist in\r\nmanaging it. Jack, who was much afraid of being left behind, was the\r\nfirst to leap in and seize an oar. There was, however, no need of it; I\r\nsteered my little boat into the current, and we were carried away with\r\nsuch velocity as almost to take our breath. Fritz was at the helm, and\r\nappeared to have no fear; I will not say that his father was so\r\ntranquil. I held Jack, for fear of accidents, but he only laughed, and\r\nobserved to his brother that the canoe galloped better than Lightfoot.\r\nWe were soon in the open sea, and directed our canoe towards the object\r\nwe had remarked, and which we still had in sight. We were afraid it was\r\nthe boat upset, but it proved to be a tolerably large cask, which had\r\nprobably been thrown overboard to lighten the distressed vessel; we saw\r\nseveral others, but neither mast nor plank to give us any idea that the\r\nvessel and boat had perished. Fritz wished much to have made the circuit\r\nof the island, to assure ourselves of this, but I would not hear of it;\r\nI thought of my wife’s terror; besides, the sea was still too rough for\r\nour frail bark, and we had, moreover, no provisions. If my canoe had not\r\nbeen well built, it would have run great risk of being overset by the\r\nwaves, which broke over it. Jack, when he saw one coming, lay down on\r\nhis face, saying he preferred having them on his back rather than in his\r\nmouth; he jumped up as soon as it passed, to help to empty the canoe,\r\ntill another wave came to fill it again; but, thanks to my out-riggers,\r\nwe preserved our balance very well, and I consented to go as far as\r\n_Cape Disappointment_, which merited the name a second time, for we\r\nfound no trace here of the vessel, though we mounted the hill, and thus\r\ncommanded a wide extent of view. As we looked round the country, it\r\nappeared completely devastated: trees torn up by the roots, plantations\r\nlevelled with the ground, water collected into absolute lakes,—all\r\nannounced desolation; and the tempest seemed to be renewing. The sky was\r\ndarkened, the wind arose, and was unfavourable for our return; nor could\r\nI venture the canoe on the waves, every instant becoming more\r\nformidable. We moored our bark to a large palm-tree we found at the foot\r\nof the hill, near the shore, and set out by land to our home. We crossed\r\nthe Gourd Wood and the Wood of Monkeys, and arrived at our farm, which\r\nwe found, to our great satisfaction, had not suffered much from the\r\nstorm. The food we had left in the stables was nearly consumed; from\r\nwhich we concluded that the animals we had left here had sheltered\r\nthemselves during the storm. We refilled the mangers with the hay we had\r\npreserved in the loft, and observing the sky getting more and more\r\nthreatening, we set out without delay for our house, from which we were\r\nyet a considerable distance. To avoid _Flamingo Marsh_, which was\r\ntowards the sea, and _Rice Marsh_, towards the rock, we determined to go\r\nthrough _Cotton Wood_, which would save us from the wind, which was\r\nready to blow us off our feet. I was still uneasy about the ship, which\r\nthe lieutenant had told me was out of repair; but I indulged a hope that\r\nthey might have taken refuge in some bay, or found anchorage on some\r\nhospitable shore, where they might get their vessel into order.\r\n\r\nJack was alarmed lest they should fall into the hands of the\r\n_anthropophagi_, who eat men like hares or sheep, of whom he had read in\r\nsome book of travels, and excited the ridicule of his brother, who was\r\nastonished at his ready belief of travellers’ tales, which he asserted\r\nwere usually false.\r\n\r\n“But Robinson Crusoe would not tell a falsehood,” said Jack,\r\nindignantly; “and there were cannibals came to his island, and were\r\ngoing to eat Friday, if he had not saved him.”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Robinson could not tell a falsehood,” said Fritz, “because he never\r\nexisted. The whole history is a romance—is not that the name, father,\r\nthat is given to works of the imagination?”\r\n\r\n“It is,” said I; “but we must not call Robinson Crusoe a romance; though\r\nRobinson himself, and all the circumstances of his history are probably\r\nfictitious, the details are all founded on truth—on the adventures and\r\ndescriptions of voyagers who may be depended on, and unfortunate\r\nindividuals who have actually been wrecked on unknown shores. If ever\r\nour journal should be printed, many may believe that it is only a\r\nromance—a mere work of the imagination.”\r\n\r\nMy boys hoped we should not have to introduce any savages into our\r\nromance, and were astonished that an island so beautiful had not tempted\r\nany to inhabit it; in fact, I had often been myself surprised at this\r\ncircumstance; but I told them many voyagers had noticed islands\r\napparently fertile, and yet uninhabited; besides, the chain of rocks\r\nwhich surrounded this might prevent the approach of savages, unless they\r\nhad discovered the little _Bay of Safety_ where we had landed. Fritz\r\nsaid he anxiously desired to circumnavigate the island, in order to\r\nascertain the size of it, and if there were similar chains of rocks on\r\nthe opposite side. I promised him, as soon as the stormy weather was\r\npast, and his mother well enough to remove to Tent House, we would take\r\nour pinnace, and set out on our little voyage.\r\n\r\nWe now approached the marsh, and he begged me to let him go and cut some\r\ncanes, as he projected making a sort of carriage for his mother. As we\r\nwere collecting them, he explained his scheme to me. He wished to weave\r\nof these reeds, which were very strong, a large and long sort of\r\npannier, in which his mother might sit or recline, and which might be\r\nsuspended between two strong bamboo canes by handles of rope. He then\r\npurposed to yoke two of our most gentle animals, the cow and the ass,\r\nthe one before and the other behind, between these shafts, the leader to\r\nbe mounted by one of the children as director; the other would follow\r\nnaturally, and the good mother would thus be carried, as if in a litter,\r\nwithout any danger of jolting. I was pleased with this idea, and we all\r\nset to work to load ourselves each with a huge burden of reeds. They\r\nrequested me not to tell my wife, that they might give her an agreeable\r\nsurprise. It needed such affection as ours to induce us to the\r\nundertaking in such unpropitious weather. It rained in torrents, and the\r\nmarsh was so soft and wet, that we were in danger of sinking at every\r\nstep. However, I could not be less courageous than my sons, whom nothing\r\ndaunted, and we soon made up our bundles, and, placing them on our\r\nheads, they formed a sort of umbrella, which was not without its\r\nbenefits. We soon arrived at Falcon’s Nest. Before we reached the tree,\r\nI saw a fire shine to such a distance, that I was alarmed; but soon\r\nfound it was only meant for our benefit by our kind friends at home.\r\nWhen my wife saw the rain falling, she had instructed her little\r\nassistant to make a fire in our usual cooking-place, at a little\r\ndistance from the tree, and protected by a canopy of waterproof cloth\r\nfrom the rain. The young cook had not only kept up a good fire to dry us\r\non our return, but had taken the opportunity of roasting two dozen of\r\nthose excellent little birds which his mother had preserved in butter,\r\nand which, all ranged on the old sword which served us for a spit, were\r\njust ready on our arrival, and the fire and feast were equally grateful\r\nto the hungry, exhausted, and wet travellers, who sat down to\r\nenjoy them.\r\n\r\nHowever, before we sat down to our repast, we went up to see our\r\ninvalids, whom we found tolerably well, though anxious for our return.\r\nErnest, with his sound hand, and the assistance of Francis, had\r\nsucceeded in forming a sort of _rampart_ before the opening into the\r\nroom, composed of the four hammocks in which he and his brothers slept,\r\nplaced side by side, on end. This sufficiently protected them from the\r\nrain, but excluded the light, so that they had been obliged to light a\r\ncandle, and Ernest had been reading to his mother in a book of voyages\r\nthat had formed part of the captain’s small library. It was a singular\r\ncoincidence, that while we were talking of the savages on the way home,\r\nthey were also reading of them; and I found my dear wife much agitated\r\nby the fears these accounts had awakened in her mind. After soothing her\r\nterrors, I returned to the fire to dry myself, and to enjoy my repast.\r\nBesides the birds, Francis had prepared fresh eggs and potatoes for us.\r\nHe told me that his mamma had given up her office of cook to him, and\r\nassured me that he would perform the duties to our satisfaction,\r\nprovided he was furnished with materials. Fritz was to hunt, Jack to\r\nfish, I was to order dinner, and he would make it ready. “And when we\r\nhave neither game nor fish,” said Jack, “we will attack your\r\npoultry-yard.” This was not at all to the taste of poor little Francis,\r\nwho could not bear his favourites to be killed, and who had actually\r\nwept over the chicken that was _slaughtered_ to make broth for his\r\nmother. We were obliged to promise him that, when other resources\r\nfailed, we would apply to our barrels of salt-fish. He, however, gave us\r\nleave to dispose as we liked of the ducks and geese, which were too\r\nnoisy for him.\r\n\r\nAfter we had concluded our repast, we carried a part of it to our\r\nfriends above, and proceeded to give them an account of our expedition.\r\nI then secured the hammocks somewhat more firmly, to save us from the\r\nstorm that was still raging, and the hour of rest being at hand, my sons\r\nestablished themselves on mattresses of cotton, made by their kind\r\nmother, and in spite of the roaring of the winds, we were soon in\r\nprofound repose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe storm continued to rage the whole of the following day, and even the\r\nday after, with the same violence. Happily our tree stood firm, though\r\nseveral branches were broken; amongst others, that to which Francis’s\r\nwire was suspended. I replaced it with more care, carried it beyond our\r\nroof, and fixed at the extremity the pointed instrument which had\r\nattracted the lightning. I then substituted for the hammocks before the\r\nwindow, strong planks, which remained from my building, and which my\r\nsons assisted me to raise with pulleys, after having sawed them to the\r\nproper length. Through these I made loop-holes, to admit the light and\r\nair. In order to carry off the rain, I fixed a sort of spout, made of\r\nthe wood of a tree I had met with, which was unknown to me, though\r\napparently somewhat like the elder. The whole of the tree, almost to\r\nthe bark, was filled up with a sort of pith, easily removed. From this\r\ntree I made the pipes for our fountain, and the remainder was now useful\r\nfor these rain-spouts. I employed those days in which I could not go\r\nout, in separating the seeds and grain, of which I saw we should have\r\nneed, and in mending our work-tools; my sons, in the mean time, nestled\r\nunder the tree among the roots, were incessantly employed in the\r\nconstruction of the carriage for their mother. The karatas had nearly\r\ncompleted the cure of Ernest’s hand, and he was able to assist his\r\nbrothers preparing the canes, which Fritz and Jack wove between the flat\r\nwooden wands, with which they had made the frame of their pannier; they\r\nsucceeded in making it so strong and close, that they might have carried\r\nliquids in it. My dear wife’s foot and leg were gradually improving; and\r\nI took the opportunity of her confinement, to reason with her on her\r\nfalse notion of the dangers of the sea, and to represent to her the\r\ngloomy prospect of our sons, if they were left alone in the island. She\r\nagreed with me, but could not resolve to leave it; she hoped God would\r\nsend some vessel to us, which might leave us some society; and after\r\nall, if our sons were left, she pointed out to me, that they had our\r\nbeautiful pinnace, and might at any time, of their own accord, leave\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\n“And why should we anticipate the evils of futurity, my dear friend?”\r\nsaid she. “Let us think only of the present. I am anxious now to know if\r\nthe storm has spared my fine kitchen-garden.”\r\n\r\n“You must wait a little,” said I. “I am as uneasy as you, for my\r\nmaize-plantations, my sugar-canes, and my corn-fields.”\r\n\r\nAt last, one night, the storm ceased, the clouds passed away, and the\r\nmoon showed herself in all her glory. How delighted we were! My wife got\r\nme to remove the large planks I had placed before the opening, and the\r\nbright moonbeams streamed through the branches of the tree into our\r\nroom; a gentle breeze refreshed us, and so delighted were we in gazing\r\non that sky of promise, that we could scarcely bear to go to bed, but\r\nspent half the night in projects for the morrow; the good mother alone\r\nsaid, that she could not join in our excursions. Jack and Francis smiled\r\nat each other, as they thought of their litter, which was now\r\nnearly finished.\r\n\r\nA bright sun awoke us early next morning. Fritz and Jack had requested\r\nme to allow them to finish their carriage; so, leaving Ernest with his\r\nmother, I took Francis with me to ascertain the damage done to the\r\ngarden at Tent House, about which his mother was so anxious. We easily\r\ncrossed the bridge, but the water had carried away some of the planks;\r\nhowever, my little boy leaped from one plank to another with great\r\nagility, though the distance was sometimes considerable. He was so proud\r\nof being my sole companion, that he scarcely touched the ground as he\r\nran on before me; but he had a sad shock when he got to the garden; of\r\nwhich we could not find the slightest trace. All was destroyed; the\r\nwalks, the fine vegetable-beds, the plantations of pines and melons—all\r\nhad vanished. Francis stood like a marble statue, as pale and still;\r\ntill, bursting into tears, he recovered himself.\r\n\r\n“Oh! my good mamma,” said he; “what will she say when she hears of this\r\nmisfortune? But she need not know it, papa,” added he, after a pause;\r\n“it would distress her too much; and if you and my brothers will help\r\nme, we will repair the damage before she can walk. The plants may not be\r\nso large; but the earth is moist, and they will grow quickly, and I will\r\nwork hard to get it into order.”\r\n\r\nI embraced my dear boy, and promised him this should be our first work.\r\nI feared we should have many other disasters to repair; but a child of\r\ntwelve years old gave me an example of resignation and courage. We\r\nagreed to come next day to begin our labour, for the garden was too well\r\nsituated for me to abandon it. It was on a gentle declivity, at the foot\r\nof the rocks, which sheltered it from the north wind, and was\r\nconveniently watered from the cascade. I resolved to add a sort of bank,\r\nor terrace, to protect it from the violent rains; and Francis was so\r\npleased with the idea, that he began to gather the large stones which\r\nwere scattered over the garden, and to carry them to the place where I\r\nwished to build my terrace. He would have worked all day, if I would\r\nhave allowed him; but I wanted to look after my young plantations, my\r\nsugar-canes, and my fields, and, after the destruction I had just\r\nwitnessed, I had everything to fear. I proceeded to the avenue of\r\nfruit-trees that led to Tent House, and was agreeably surprised. All\r\nwere half-bowed to the ground, as well as the bamboos that supported\r\nthem, but few were torn up; and I saw that my sons and I, with the\r\nlabour of two or three days, could restore them. Some of them had\r\nalready begun to bear fruit, but all was destroyed for this year. This\r\nwas, however, a trifling loss, compared with what I had anticipated;\r\nfor, having no more plants of European fruits, I could not have replaced\r\nthem. Besides, having resolved to inhabit Tent House at present,\r\nentirely,—being there defended from storms,—it was absolutely\r\nnecessary to contrive some protection from the heat. My new plantations\r\nafforded little shade yet, and I trembled to propose to my wife to come\r\nand inhabit these burning rocks. Francis was gathering some of the\r\nbeautiful unknown flowers of the island for his mother, and when he had\r\nformed his nosegay, bringing it to me,—\r\n\r\n“See, papa,” said he, “how the rain has refreshed these flowers. I wish\r\nit would rain still, it is so dreadfully hot here. Oh! if we had but a\r\nlittle shade.”\r\n\r\n“That is just what I was thinking of, my dear,” said I; “we shall have\r\nshade enough when my trees are grown; but, in the mean time—”\r\n\r\n“In the mean time, papa,” said Francis, “I will tell you what you must\r\ndo. You must make a very long, broad colonnade before our house, covered\r\nwith cloth, and open before, so that mamma may have air and shade\r\nat once.”\r\n\r\nI was pleased with my son’s idea, and promised him to construct a\r\ngallery soon, and call it the _Franciade_ in honour of him. My little\r\nboy was delighted that his suggestion should be thus approved, and\r\nbegged me not to tell his mamma, as he wished to surprise her, as much\r\nas his brothers did with their carriage; and he hoped the _Franciade_\r\nmight be finished before she visited Tent House. I assured him I would\r\nbe silent; and we took the road hence, talking about our new colonnade.\r\nI projected making it in the most simple and easy way. A row of strong\r\nbamboo canes planted at equal distances along the front of our house,\r\nand united by a plank of wood at the top cut into arches between the\r\ncanes; others I would place sloping from the rock, to which I would\r\nfasten them by iron cramps; these were to be covered with sailcloth,\r\nprepared with the elastic gum, and well secured to the plank. This\r\nbuilding would not take much time, and I anticipated the pleasure of my\r\nwife when she found out that it was an invention of her little\r\nfavourite, who, of a mild and reflecting disposition, was beloved by us\r\nall. As we walked along, we saw something approaching, that Francis soon\r\ndiscovered to be his brothers, with their new carriage; and, concluding\r\nthat his mamma occupied it, he hastened to meet them, lest they should\r\nproceed to the garden. But on our approach, we discovered that Ernest\r\nwas in the litter, which was borne by the cow before, on which Fritz was\r\nmounted, and by the ass behind, with Jack on it. Ernest declared the\r\nconveyance was so easy and delightful that he should often take his\r\nmother’s place.\r\n\r\n“I like that very much,” said Jack; “then I will take care that we will\r\nharness the onagra and the buffalo for you, and they will give you a\r\npretty jolting, I promise you. The cow and ass are only for mamma. Look,\r\npapa, is it not complete? We wished to try it as soon as we finished\r\nit, so we got Ernest to occupy it, while mother was asleep.”\r\n\r\nErnest declared it only wanted two cushions, one to sit upon, the other\r\nto recline against, to make it perfect; and though I could not help\r\nsmiling at his love of ease, I encouraged the notion, in order to delay\r\nmy wife’s excursion till our plans were completed. I then put Francis\r\ninto the carriage beside his brother; and ordering Fritz and Jack to\r\nproceed with their equipage to inspect our corn-fields, I returned to my\r\nwife, who was still sleeping. On her awaking, I told her the garden and\r\nplantations would require a few days’ labour to set them in order, and I\r\nshould leave Ernest, who was not yet in condition to be a labourer, to\r\nnurse her and read to her. My sons returned in the evening, and gave me\r\na melancholy account of our corn-fields; the corn was completely\r\ndestroyed, and we regretted this the more, as we had very little left\r\nfor seed. We had anticipated a feast of _real bread_, but we were\r\nobliged to give up all hope for this year, and to content ourselves with\r\nour cakes of cassava, and with potatoes. The maize had suffered less,\r\nand might have been a resource for us, but the large, hard grain was so\r\nvery difficult to reduce to flour fine enough for dough. Fritz often\r\nrecurred to the necessity of building a mill near the cascade at Tent\r\nHouse; but this was not the work of a moment, and we had time to\r\nconsider of it; for at present we had no corn to grind. As I found\r\nFrancis had let his brothers into all our secrets, it was agreed that I,\r\nwith Fritz, Jack, and Francis, should proceed to Tent House next\r\nmorning. Francis desired to be of the party, that he might direct the\r\nlaying out of the garden, he said, with an important air, as he had been\r\nhis mother’s assistant on its formation. We arranged our bag of\r\nvegetable-seeds, and having bathed my wife’s foot with a simple\r\nembrocation, we offered our united prayers, and retired to our beds to\r\nprepare ourselves for the toils of the next day.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe rose early; and, after our usual morning duties, we left our invalids\r\nfor the whole day, taking with us, for our dinner, a goose and some\r\npotatoes, made ready the evening before. We harnessed the bull and the\r\nbuffalo to the cart, and I sent Fritz and Jack to the wood of bamboos,\r\nwith orders to load the cart with as many as it would contain; and,\r\nespecially, to select some very thick ones for my colonnade; the rest I\r\nintended for props for my young trees; and this I proposed to be my\r\nfirst undertaking. Francis would have preferred beginning with the\r\n_Franciade_, or the garden, but he was finally won over by the thoughts\r\nof the delicious fruits, which we might lose by our neglect; the\r\npeaches, plums, pears, and, above all, the cherries, of which he was\r\nvery fond. He then consented to assist me in holding the trees whilst I\r\nreplaced the roots; after which he went to cut the reeds to tie them.\r\nSuddenly I heard him cry, “Papa, papa, here is a large chest come for\r\nus; come and take it.” I ran to him, and saw it was the very chest we\r\nhad seen floating, and which we had taken for the boat at a distance;\r\nthe waves had left it in our bay, entangled in the reeds, which grew\r\nabundantly here. It was almost buried in the sand. We could not remove\r\nit alone, and, notwithstanding our curiosity, we were compelled to wait\r\nfor the arrival of my sons. We returned to our work, and it was pretty\r\nwell advanced when the tired and hungry party returned with their\r\ncart-load of bamboos. We rested, and sat down to eat our goose. Guavas\r\nand sweet acorns, which had escaped the storm, and which my sons\r\nbrought, completed our repast. Fritz had killed a large bird in the\r\nmarsh, which I took at first for a young flamingo; but it was a young\r\ncassowary, the first I had seen in the island. This bird is remarkable\r\nfor its extraordinary size, and for its plumage, so short and fine that\r\nit seems rather to be hair than feathers. I should have liked to have\r\nhad it alive to ornament our poultry-yard, and it was so young we might\r\nhave tamed it; but Fritz’s unerring aim had killed it at once. I wished\r\nto let my wife see this rare bird, which, if standing on its webbed\r\nfeet, would have been four feet high; I therefore forbade them to\r\nmeddle with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Fritz, with a strong hatchet forced the chest open, and\r\nwe all eagerly crowded to see the contents.”]\r\n\r\nAs we ate, we talked of the chest, and our curiosity being stronger\r\nthan our hunger, we swallowed our repast hastily, and then ran down\r\nto the shore. We were obliged to plunge into the water up to the\r\nwaist, and then had some difficulty to extricate it from the weed\r\nand slime, and to push it on shore. No sooner had we placed it in\r\nsafety than Fritz, with a strong hatchet, forced it open, and we all\r\neagerly crowded to see the contents. Fritz hoped it would be powder\r\nand fire-arms; Jack, who was somewhat fond of dress, and had notions\r\nof elegance, declared in favour of clothes, and particularly of linen,\r\nfiner and whiter than that which his mother wove; if Ernest had been\r\nthere, books would have been his desire; for my own part, there was\r\nnothing I was more anxious for than European seeds, particularly corn;\r\nFrancis had a lingering wish that the chest might contain some of\r\nthose gingerbread cakes which his grandmamma used to treat him with\r\nin Europe, and which he had often regretted; but he kept this wish to\r\nhimself, for fear his brothers should call him “little glutton,” and\r\nassured us that he should like a little pocket-knife, with a small\r\nsaw, better than anything in the world; and he was the only one who\r\nhad his wish. The chest was opened, and we saw that it was filled with\r\na number of trifling things likely to tempt savage nations, and to\r\nbecome the means of exchange,—principally glass and iron ware, coloured\r\nbeads, pins, needles, looking-glasses, children’s toys, constructed as\r\nmodels, such as carts, and tools of every sort; amongst which we found\r\nsome likely to be useful, such as hatchets, saws, planes, gimlets,\r\n&c.; besides a collection of knives, of which Francis had the choice;\r\nand scissors, which were reserved for mamma, her own being nearly worn\r\nout. I had, moreover, the pleasure of finding a quantity of nails of\r\nevery size and kind, besides iron hooks, staples, &c., which I needed\r\ngreatly. After we had examined the contents, and selected what we\r\nwanted immediately, we closed up the chest, and conveyed it to our\r\nmagazine at Tent House. We had spent so much time in our examination,\r\nthat we had some difficulty to finish propping our trees, and to arrive\r\nat home before it was dark. We found my wife somewhat uneasy at our\r\nlengthened absence, but our appearance soon calmed her. “Mother,” said\r\nI, “I have brought back all your chickens to crowd under your wing.”\r\n\r\n“And we have not come back empty-handed,” said Jack. “Look, mamma; here\r\nare a beautiful pair of scissors, a large paper of needles, another of\r\npins, and a thimble! How rich you are now! And when you get well, you\r\ncan make me a pretty waistcoat and a pair of trousers, for I am in great\r\nwant of them.”\r\n\r\n“And I, mamma,” said Francis, “have brought you a mirror, that you may\r\narrange your cap; you have often been sorry papa did not remember to\r\nbring one from the ship. This was intended for the savages, and I will\r\nbegin with you.”\r\n\r\n“I believe I rather resemble one now,” said my good Elizabeth, arranging\r\nthe red and yellow silk handkerchief which she usually wore on her head.\r\n\r\n“Only, mamma,” said Jack, “when you wear the comical pointed bonnet\r\nwhich Ernest made you.”\r\n\r\n“What matters it,” said she, “whether it be pointed or round? It will\r\nprotect me from the sun, and it is the work of my Ernest, to whom I am\r\nmuch obliged.”\r\n\r\nErnest, with great ingenuity and patience, had endeavoured to plait his\r\nmother a bonnet of the rice-straw; he had succeeded; but not knowing how\r\nto form the round crown, he was obliged to finish it in a point, to the\r\ngreat and incessant diversion of his brothers.\r\n\r\n“Mother,” said Ernest, in his usual grave and thoughtful tone, “I\r\nshould not like you to look like a savage; therefore, as soon as I\r\nregain the use of my hand, my first work shall be to make you a bonnet,\r\nwhich I will take care shall be formed with a round crown, as you will\r\nlend me one of your large needles, and I will take, to sew the crown on,\r\nthe head of either Jack or Francis.”\r\n\r\n“What do you mean? My head!” said they both together.\r\n\r\n“Oh, I don’t mean to take it off your shoulders,” said he; “it will only\r\nbe necessary that one of you should kneel down before me, for a day\r\nperhaps, while I use your head as a model; and you need not cry out much\r\nif I should chance to push my needle in.”\r\n\r\nThis time the philosopher had the laugh on his side, and his tormentors\r\nwere silenced.\r\n\r\nWe now explained to my wife where we had found the presents we had\r\nbrought her. My offerings to her were a light axe, which she could use\r\nto cut her fire-wood with, and an iron kettle, smaller and more\r\nconvenient than the one she had. Fritz had retired, and now came in\r\ndragging with difficulty his huge cassowary. “Here, mamma,” said he, “I\r\nhave brought you a little chicken for your dinner;” and the astonishment\r\nand laughter again commenced. The rest of the evening was spent in\r\nplucking the bird, to prepare part of it for next day. We then retired\r\nto rest, that we might begin our labour early next morning. Ernest chose\r\nto remain with his books and his mother, for whom he formed with the\r\nmattresses a sort of reclining chair, in which she was able to sit up in\r\nbed and sew. Thus she endured a confinement of six weeks, without\r\ncomplaint, and in that time got all our clothes put into good order.\r\nFrancis had nearly betrayed our secret once, by asking his mamma to make\r\nhim a mason’s apron. “A mason’s apron!” said she; “are you going to\r\nbuild a house, child?”\r\n\r\n“I meant to say a gardener’s apron,” said he.\r\n\r\nHis mamma was satisfied, and promised to comply with his request.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, my three sons and I laboured assiduously to get the\r\ngarden into order again, and to raise the terraces, which we hoped might\r\nbe a defence against future storms. Fritz had also proposed to me to\r\nconstruct a stone conduit, to bring the water to our kitchen-garden from\r\nthe river, to which we might carry it back, after it had passed round\r\nour vegetable-beds. This was a formidable task, but too useful an affair\r\nto be neglected; and, aided by the geometrical skill of Fritz, and the\r\nready hands of my two younger boys, the conduit was completed. I took an\r\nopportunity, at the same time, to dig a pond above the garden, into\r\nwhich the conduit poured the water; this was always warm with the sun,\r\nand, by means of a sluice, we were able to disperse it in little\r\nchannels to water the garden. The pond would also be useful to preserve\r\nsmall fish and crabs for use. We next proceeded to our embankment. This\r\nwas intended to protect the garden from any extraordinary overflow of\r\nthe river, and from the water running from the rocks after heavy rains.\r\nWe then laid out our garden on the same plan as before, except that I\r\nmade the walks wider, and not so flat; I carried one directly to our\r\nhouse, which, in the autumn, I intended to plant with shrubs, that my\r\nwife might have a shady avenue to approach her garden; where I also\r\nplanned an arbour, furnished with seats, as a resting-place for her. The\r\nrocks were covered with numerous climbing plants, bearing every variety\r\nof elegant flower, and I had only to make my selection.\r\n\r\nAll this work, with the enclosing the garden with palisades of bamboo,\r\noccupied us about a fortnight, in which time our invalids made great\r\nprogress towards their recovery. After the whole was finished, Francis\r\nentreated me to begin his gallery. My boys approved of my plan, and\r\nFritz declared that the house was certainly comfortable and commodious,\r\nbut that it would be wonderfully improved by a colonnade, with a little\r\npavilion at each end, and a fountain in each pavilion.\r\n\r\n“I never heard a word of these pavilions,” said I.\r\n\r\n“No,” said Jack, “they are our own invention. The colonnade will be\r\ncalled the _Franciade_; and we wish our little pavilions to be named,\r\nthe one _Fritzia_, the other _Jackia_, if you please.”\r\n\r\nI agreed to this reasonable request, and only begged to know how they\r\nwould procure water for their fountains. Fritz undertook to bring the\r\nwater, if I would only assist them in completing this little scheme, to\r\ngive pleasure to their beloved mother. I was charmed to see the zeal and\r\nanxiety of my children to oblige their tender mother. Her illness seemed\r\nto have strengthened their attachment; they thought only how to console\r\nand amuse her. She sometimes told me she really blessed the accident,\r\nwhich had taught her how much she was valued by all around her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day was Sunday,—our happy Sabbath for repose and quiet\r\nconversation at home. After passing the day in our usual devotions and\r\nsober reading, my three elder boys requested my permission to walk\r\ntowards our farm in the evening. On their return, they informed me it\r\nwould be necessary to give a few days’ labour to our plantations of\r\nmaize and potatoes. I therefore determined to look to them.\r\n\r\nThough I was out early next morning, I found Fritz and Jack had been\r\ngone some time, leaving only the ass in the stables, which I secured for\r\nmy little Francis. I perceived, also, that they had dismounted my cart,\r\nand carried away the wheels, from which I concluded that they had met\r\nwith some tree in their walk the preceding evening, suitable for the\r\npipes for their fountains, and that they had now returned to cut it\r\ndown, and convey it to Tent House. As I did not know where to meet with\r\nthem, I proceeded with Francis on the ass to commence his favourite\r\nwork. I drew my plan on the ground first. At the distance of twelve feet\r\nfrom the rock which formed the front of our house, I marked a straight\r\nline of fifty feet, which I divided into ten spaces of five feet each\r\nfor my colonnade; the two ends were to be reserved for the two pavilions\r\nmy sons wished to build. I was busy in my calculations, and Francis\r\nplacing stakes in the places where I wished to dig, when the cart drove\r\nup with our two good labourers. They had, as I expected, found the\r\nevening before a species of pine, well adapted for their pipes. They had\r\ncut down four, of fifteen or twenty feet in length, which they had\r\nbrought on the wheels of the cart, drawn by the four animals. They had\r\nhad some difficulty in transporting them to the place; and the greatest\r\nstill remained—the boring the trunks, and then uniting them firmly. I\r\nhad neither augers nor any tools fit for the purpose. I had, certainly,\r\nconstructed a little fountain at Falcon’s Nest; but the stream was near\r\nat hand, and was easily conveyed by cane pipes to our tortoise-shell\r\nbasin. Here the distance was considerable, the ground unequal, and, to\r\nhave the water pure and cool, underground pipes were necessary. I\r\nthought of large bamboos, but Fritz pointed out the knots, and the\r\ndifficulty of joining the pieces, and begged me to leave it to him, as\r\nhe had seen fountains made in Switzerland, and had no fears of success.\r\nIn the mean time, all hands set to work at the arcade. We selected\r\ntwelve bamboos of equal height and thickness, and fixed them securely in\r\nthe earth, at five feet from each other. These formed a pretty\r\ncolonnade, and were work enough for one day.\r\n\r\nWe took care to divert all inquiries at night, by discussing the\r\nsubjects which our invalids had been reading during the day. The little\r\nlibrary of our captain was very choice; besides the voyages and travels,\r\nwhich interested them greatly, there was a good collection of\r\nhistorians, and some of the best poets, for which Ernest had no little\r\ntaste. However, he requested earnestly that he might be of our party\r\nnext day, and Francis, good-naturedly, offered to stay with mamma,\r\nexpecting, no doubt, Ernest’s congratulations on the forward state of\r\nthe Franciade. The next morning Ernest and I set out, his brothers\r\nhaving preceded us. Poor Ernest regretted, as we went, that he had no\r\nshare in these happy schemes for his mother. I reminded him, however, of\r\nhis dutiful care of her during her sickness, and all his endeavours to\r\namuse her. “And, besides,” added I, “did you not make her a\r\nstraw bonnet?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said he, “and I now remember what a frightful shape it was. I\r\nwill try to make a better, and will go to-morrow morning to choose\r\nmy straw.”\r\n\r\nAs we approached Tent House, we heard a most singular noise, echoing at\r\nintervals amongst the rocks. We soon discovered the cause; in a hollow\r\nof the rocks I saw a very hot fire, which Jack was blowing through a\r\ncane, whilst Fritz was turning amidst the embers a bar of iron. When it\r\nwas red-hot, they laid it on an anvil I had brought from the ship, and\r\nstruck it alternately with hammers to bring it to a point.\r\n\r\n“Well done, my young smiths,” said I; “we ought to try all things, and\r\nkeep what is good. Do you expect to succeed in making your auger? I\r\nsuppose that is what you want.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, father,” said Fritz; “we should succeed well enough if we only had\r\na good pair of bellows; you see we have already got a tolerable point.”\r\n\r\nNow Fritz could not believe anything was impossible. He had killed a\r\nkangaroo the evening before, and skinned it. The flesh made us a dinner;\r\nof the skin he determined to make a pair of bellows. He nailed it, with\r\nthe hair out, not having time to tan it, to two flat pieces of wood,\r\nwith holes in them; to this he added a reed for the pipe; he then fixed\r\nit by means of a long cord and a post, to the side of his fire, and\r\nJack, with his hand or his foot, blew the fire, so that the iron was\r\nspeedily red-hot, and quite malleable. I then showed them how to twist\r\nthe iron into a screw,—rather clumsy, but which would answer the\r\npurpose tolerably well. At one end they formed a ring, in which we\r\nplaced a piece of wood transversely, to enable them to turn the screw.\r\nWe then made a trial of it. We placed a tree on two props, and Fritz and\r\nI managed the auger so well, that we had our tree pierced through in a\r\nvery little time, working first at one end and then at the other. Jack,\r\nin the mean time, collected the shavings we made, which he deposited in\r\nthe kitchen for his mother’s use, to kindle the fire. Ernest, meanwhile,\r\nwas walking about, making observations, and giving his advice to his\r\nbrothers on the architecture of their pavilions, till, seeing they were\r\ngoing to bore another tree, he retired into the garden to see the\r\nembankment. He returned delighted with the improvements, and much\r\ndisposed to take some employment. He wanted to assist in boring the\r\ntree, but we could not all work at it. I undertook this labour myself,\r\nand sent him to blow the bellows, while his brothers laboured at the\r\nforge, the work not being too hard for his lame hand. My young smiths\r\nwere engaged in flattening the iron to make joints to unite their pipes;\r\nthey succeeded very well, and then began to dig the ground to lay them.\r\nErnest, knowing something of geometry and land-surveying, was able to\r\ngive them some useful hints, which enabled them to complete their work\r\nsuccessfully. Leaving them to do this, I employed myself in covering in\r\nmy long colonnade. After I had placed on my columns a plank cut in\r\narches, which united them, and was firmly nailed to them, I extended\r\nfrom it bamboos, placed sloping against the rock, and secured to it by\r\ncramps of iron, the work of my young smiths. When my bamboo roof was\r\nsolidly fixed, the canes as close as possible, I filled the interstices\r\nwith a clay I found near the river, and poured gum over it; I had thus\r\nan impervious and brilliant roof, which appeared to be varnished, and\r\nstriped green and brown. I then raised the floor a foot, in order that\r\nthere might be no damp, and paved it with the square stones I had\r\npreserved when we cut the rock. It must be understood that all this was\r\nthe work of many days. I was assisted by Jack and Fritz, and by Ernest\r\nand Francis alternately, one always remaining with his mother, who was\r\nstill unable to walk. Ernest employed his time, when at home, in making\r\nthe straw bonnet, without either borrowing his brother’s head for a\r\nmodel, or letting any of them know what he was doing. Nevertheless, he\r\nassisted his brothers with their pavilions by his really valuable\r\nknowledge. They formed them very elegantly,—something like a Chinese\r\npagoda. They were exactly square, supported on four columns, and rather\r\nhigher than the gallery. The roofs terminated in a point, and resembled\r\n_a large parasol_. The fountains were in the middle; the basins,\r\nbreast-high, were formed of the shells of two turtles from our\r\nreservoir, which were mercilessly sacrificed for the purpose, and\r\nfurnished our table abundantly for some days. They succeeded the\r\ncassowary, which had supplied us very seasonably: its flesh tasted like\r\nbeef, and made excellent soup.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the fountains. Ernest suggested the idea of ornamenting\r\nthe end of the perpendicular pipe, which brought the water to the basin,\r\nwith shells; every sort might be collected on the shore, of the most\r\nbrilliant colours, and curious and varied shapes. He was passionately\r\ndevoted to natural history, and had made a collection of these,\r\nendeavouring to classify them from the descriptions he met with in the\r\nbooks of voyages and travels. Some of these, of the most dazzling\r\nbeauty, were placed round the pipe, which had been plastered with clay;\r\nfrom thence the water was received into a _volute_, shaped like an\r\nantique urn, and again was poured gracefully into the large\r\nturtle-shell; a small channel conveyed it then out of the pavilions. The\r\nwhole was completed in less time than I could have imagined, and greatly\r\nsurpassed my expectations; conferring an inestimable advantage on our\r\ndwelling, by securing us from the heat. All honour was rendered to\r\nMaster Francis, the inventor, and _The Franciade_ was written in large\r\nletters on the middle arch; _Fritzia_ and _Jackia_ were written in the\r\nsame way over the pavilions. Ernest alone was not named; and he seemed\r\nsomewhat affected by it. He had acquired a great taste for rambling and\r\nbotanizing, and had communicated it also to Fritz, and now that our\r\nlabours were ended at Tent House, they left us to nurse our invalid, and\r\nmade long excursions together, which lasted sometimes whole days. As\r\nthey generally returned with some game, or some new fruit, we pardoned\r\ntheir absence, and they were always welcome. Sometimes they brought a\r\nkangaroo, sometimes an agouti, the flesh of which resembles that of a\r\nrabbit, but is richer; sometimes they brought wild ducks, pigeons, and\r\neven partridges. These were contributed by Fritz, who never went out\r\nwithout his gun and his dogs. Ernest brought us natural curiosities,\r\nwhich amused us much,—stones, crystals, petrifactions, insects,\r\nbutterflies of rare beauty, and flowers, whose colours and fragrance no\r\none in Europe can form an idea of. Sometimes he brought fruit, which we\r\nalways administered first to our monkey, as taster: some of them proved\r\nvery delicious. Two of his discoveries, especially, were most valuable\r\nacquisitions,—the guajaraba, on the large leaf of which one may write\r\nwith a pointed instrument, and the fruit of which, a sort of grape, is\r\nvery good to eat; also the date-palm, every part of which is so useful,\r\nthat we were truly thankful to Heaven, and our dear boys, for the\r\ndiscovery. Whilst young, the trunk contains a sort of _marrow_, very\r\ndelicious. The date-palm is crowned by a head, formed of from forty to\r\neighty leafy branches, which spread round the top. The dates are\r\nparticularly good about half-dried; and my wife immediately began to\r\npreserve them. My sons could only bring the fruit now, but we purposed\r\nto transplant some of the trees themselves near our abode. We did not\r\ndiscourage our sons in these profitable expeditions; but they had\r\nanother aim, which I was yet ignorant of. In the mean time, I usually\r\nwalked with one of my younger sons towards Tent House, to attend to our\r\ngarden, and to see if our works continued in good condition to receive\r\nmamma, who daily improved; but I insisted on her being completely\r\nrestored, before she was introduced to them. Our dwelling looked\r\nbeautiful amongst the picturesque rocks, surrounded by trees of every\r\nsort, and facing the smooth and lovely Bay of Safety. The garden was not\r\nso forward as I could have wished; but we were obliged to be patient,\r\nand hope for the best.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day, having gone over with my younger sons to weed the garden, and\r\nsurvey our possessions, I perceived that the roof of the gallery wanted\r\na little repair, and called Jack to raise for me the rope ladder which I\r\nhad brought from Falcon’s Nest, and which had been very useful while we\r\nwere constructing the roof; but we sought for it everywhere; it could\r\nnot be found; and as we were quite free from _robbers_ in our island, I\r\ncould only accuse my elder sons, who had doubtless carried it off to\r\nascend some tall cocoa-nut tree. Obliged to be content, we walked into\r\nthe garden by the foot of the rocks. Since our arrival, I had been\r\nsomewhat uneasy at hearing a dull, continued noise, which appeared to\r\nproceed from this side. The forge we had passed, now extinguished, and\r\nour workmen were absent. Passing along, close to the rocks, the noise\r\nbecame more distinct, and I was truly alarmed. Could it be an\r\nearthquake? Or perhaps it announced some volcanic explosion. I stopped\r\nbefore that part of the rock where the noise was loudest; the surface\r\nwas firm and level; but from time to time, blows and falling stones\r\nseemed to strike our ears. I was uncertain what to do; curiosity\r\nprompted me to stay, but a sort of terror urged me to remove my child\r\nand myself. However, Jack, always daring, was unwilling to go till he\r\nhad discovered the cause of the phenomenon. “If Francis were here,” said\r\nhe, “he would fancy it was the wicked gnomes, working underground, and\r\nhe would be in a fine fright. For my part, I believe it is only people\r\ncome to collect the salt in the rock.”\r\n\r\n“People!” said I; “you don’t know what you are saying, Jack; I could\r\nexcuse Francis and his _gnomes_,—it would be at least a poetic fancy,\r\nbut yours is quite absurd. Where are the people to come from?”\r\n\r\n“But what else can it be?” said he. “Hark! you may hear them strike the\r\nrock.”\r\n\r\n“Be certain, however,” said I, “there are no people.” At that moment, I\r\ndistinctly heard human voices, speaking, laughing, and apparently\r\nclapping their hands. I could not distinguish any words; I was struck\r\nwith a mortal terror; but Jack, whom nothing could alarm, clapped his\r\nhands also, with joy, that he had guessed right. “What did I say, papa?\r\nWas I not right? Are there not people within the rock?—friends, I\r\nhope.” He was approaching the rock, when it appeared to me to be\r\nshaking; a stone soon fell down, then another. I seized hold of Jack, to\r\ndrag him away, lest he should be crushed by the fragments of rock. At\r\nthat moment another stone fell, and we saw two heads appear through the\r\nopening,—the heads of Fritz and Ernest. Judge of our surprise and joy!\r\nJack was soon through the opening, and assisting his brothers to\r\nenlarge it. As soon as I could enter, I stepped in, and found myself in\r\na real grotto, of a round form, with a vaulted roof, divided by a narrow\r\ncrevice, which admitted the light and air. It was, however, better\r\nlighted by two large gourd lamps. I saw my long ladder of ropes\r\nsuspended from the opening at the top, and thus comprehended how my sons\r\nhad penetrated into this recess, which it was impossible to suspect the\r\nexistence of from the outside. But how had they discovered it? and what\r\nwere they making of it? These were my two questions. Ernest replied at\r\nonce to the last. “I wished,” said he, “to make a resting-place for my\r\nmother, when she came to her garden. My brothers have each built some\r\nplace for her, and called it by their name. I had a desire that some\r\nplace in our island might be dedicated to Ernest, and I now present you\r\nthe _Grotto Ernestine_.”\r\n\r\n“And after all,” said Jack, “it will make a pretty dwelling for the\r\nfirst of us that marries.”\r\n\r\n“Silence, little giddy-pate,” said I; “where do you expect to find a\r\nwife in this island? Do you think you shall discover one among the\r\nrocks, as your brothers have discovered the grotto? But tell me, Fritz,\r\nwhat directed you here.”\r\n\r\n“Our good star, father,” said he. “Ernest and I were walking round these\r\nrocks, and talking of his wish for a resting-place for my mother on her\r\nway to the garden. He projected a tent; but the path was too narrow to\r\nadmit it; and the rock, heated by the sun, was like a stove. We were\r\nconsidering what we should do, when I saw on the summit of the rock a\r\nvery beautiful little unknown quadruped. From its form I should have\r\ntaken it for a young chamois, if I had been in Switzerland; but Ernest\r\nreminded me that the chamois was peculiar to cold countries, and he\r\nthought it was a gazelle or antelope; probably the gazelle of Guinea or\r\nJava, called by naturalists the chevrotain. You may suppose I tried to\r\nclimb the rock on which this little animal remained standing, with one\r\nfoot raised, and its pretty head turning first to one side and then to\r\nthe other; but it was useless to attempt it here, where the rock was\r\nsmooth and perpendicular; besides, I should have put the gazelle to\r\nflight, as it is a timid and wild animal. I then remembered there was a\r\nplace near Tent House where a considerable break occurred in the chain\r\nof rocks, and we found that, with a little difficulty, the rock might be\r\nscaled by ascending this ravine. Ernest laughed at me, and asked me if I\r\nexpected the antelope would wait patiently till I got to it? No matter,\r\nI determined to try, and I told him to remain; but he soon determined to\r\naccompany me, for he fancied that in the fissure of a rock he saw a\r\nflower of a beautiful rose-colour, which was unknown to him. My learned\r\nbotanist thought it must be an _erica_, or heath, and wished to\r\nascertain the fact. One helping the other, we soon got through all\r\ndifficulties, and arrived at the summit; and here we were amply repaid\r\nby the beautiful prospect on every side. We will talk of that\r\nafterwards, father; I have formed some idea of the country which these\r\nrocks separate us from. But to return to our grotto. I went along, first\r\nlooking for my pretty gazelle, which I saw licking a piece of rock,\r\nwhere doubtless she found some salt. I was hardly a hundred yards from\r\nher, my gun ready, when I was suddenly stopped by a crevice, which I\r\ncould not cross, though the opening was not very wide. The pretty\r\nquadruped was on the rock opposite to me; but of what use would it have\r\nbeen to shoot it, when I could not secure it. I was obliged to defer it\r\ntill a better opportunity offered, and turned to examine the opening,\r\nwhich appeared deep; still I could see that the bottom of the cavity was\r\nwhite, like that of our former grotto. I called Ernest, who was behind\r\nme, with his plants and stones, to impart to him an idea that suddenly\r\nstruck me. It was, to make this the retreat for my mother. I told him\r\nthat I believed the floor of the cave was nearly on a level with the\r\npath that led to the garden, and we had only to make an opening in the\r\nform of a natural grotto, and it would be exactly what he wished. Ernest\r\nwas much pleased with the idea, and said he could easily ascertain the\r\nlevel by means of a weight attached to a string; but though he was\r\nstartled at the difficulty of descending to our labour every day, and\r\nreturning in the evening, he would not agree to my wish of beginning at\r\nthe outside of the rock, as we had done in our former grotto, He had\r\nseveral reasons for wishing to work from within. ‘In the first place,’\r\nsaid he, ‘it will be so much cooler this summer weather; we should be\r\nsoon unable to go on labouring before the burning rock; then our path is\r\nso narrow, that we should not know how to dispose of the rubbish; in the\r\ninterior, it will serve us to make a bench round the grotto; besides, I\r\nshould have such pleasure in completing it secretly, and unsuspected,\r\nwithout any assistance or advice except yours, my dear Fritz, which I\r\naccept with all my heart; so pray find out some means of descending and\r\nascending readily.’\r\n\r\n“I immediately recollected your rope ladder, father; it was forty feet\r\nlong, and we could easily fasten it to the point of the rock. Ernest was\r\ndelighted and sanguine. We returned with all speed. We took first a roll\r\nof cord and some candles; then the rope ladder, which we rolled up as\r\nwell as we could, but had great difficulty in conveying it up the rock;\r\nonce or twice, when the ascent was very difficult, we were obliged to\r\nfasten a cord to it, and draw it up after us; but determination,\r\ncourage, and perseverance overcame all obstacles. We arrived at the\r\nopening, and, on sounding it, we were glad to find our ladder would be\r\nlong enough to reach the bottom. We then measured the outside of the\r\nrock, and ascertained that the floor of the grotto was near the same\r\nlevel as the ground outside. We remembered your lessons, father, and\r\nmade some experiments to discover if it contained mephitic air. We first\r\nlighted some candles, which were not extinguished; we then kindled a\r\nlarge heap of sticks and dried grass, which-burned well, the smoke\r\npassing through the opening like a chimney. Having no uneasiness about\r\nthis, we deferred our commencement till the next day. Then we lighted\r\nthe forge, and pointed some iron bars we found in the magazine; these\r\nwere to be our tools to break open the rock. We secured, also, your\r\nchisel, as well as some hammers, and all our tools were thrown down\r\nbelow; we then arranged two gourds to serve us for lamps; and when all\r\nwas ready, and our ladder firmly fixed, we descended ourselves; and we\r\nhave nothing more to tell you, except that we were very glad when we\r\nheard your voices outside, at the very time when our work was drawing to\r\nan end. We were sure, when we distinguished your voices so clearly, that\r\nwe must be near the external air; we redoubled our efforts, and here we\r\nare. Now tell us, father, are you pleased with our idea? and will you\r\nforgive us for making a mystery of it?”\r\n\r\nI assured them of my forgiveness, and my cordial approbation of their\r\nmanly and useful enterprise; and made Ernest happy by declaring that it\r\nshould always be called the _Grotto Ernestine_.\r\n\r\n“Thanks to you all, my dear children,” said I; “your dear mamma will now\r\nprefer Tent House to Falcon’s Nest, and will have no occasion to risk\r\nbreaking a limb in descending the winding staircase. I will assist you\r\nto enlarge the opening, and as we will leave it all the simplicity of a\r\nnatural grotto, it will soon be ready.”\r\n\r\nWe all set to work; Jack carried away the loosened stones and rubbish,\r\nand formed benches on each side the grotto. With what had fallen\r\noutside, he also made two seats in the front of the rock, and before\r\nevening all was complete. Fritz ascended to unfasten the ladder, and to\r\nconvey it by an easier road to Tent House; he then rejoined us, and we\r\nreturned to our castle in the air, which was henceforward only to be\r\nlooked on as a pleasure-house. We resolved, however, to establish here,\r\nas we had done at our farm, a colony of our cattle, which increased\r\ndaily: we had now a number of young cows, which were most useful for our\r\nsupport. We wished, however, for a female buffalo, as the milk of that\r\nanimal makes excellent cheese. Conversing on our future plans, we soon\r\nreached home, and found all well.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a few days we completed the _Grotto Ernestine_. It contained some\r\nstalactites; but not so many as our former grotto. We found, however, a\r\nbeautiful block of salt, which resembled white marble, of which Ernest\r\nformed a sort of altar, supported by four pillars, on which he placed a\r\npretty vase of citron-wood, which he had turned himself, and in which he\r\narranged some of the beautiful _erica_ which had been the cause of his\r\ndiscovering the grotto. It was one of those occasions when his feelings\r\novercame his natural indolence, when he became for a time the most\r\nactive of the four, and brought forward all his resources, which were\r\nmany. This indolence was merely physical; when not excited by any sudden\r\ncircumstance, or by some fancy which soon assumed the character of a\r\npassion, he loved ease, and to enjoy life tranquilly in study. He\r\nimproved his mind continually, as well by his excellent memory, as by\r\nnatural talent and application. He reflected, made experiments, and was\r\nalways successful. He had at last succeeded in making his mother a very\r\npretty bonnet. He had also composed some verses, which were intended to\r\ncelebrate her visit to Tent House; and this joyful day being at last\r\nfixed, the boys all went over, the evening before, to make their\r\npreparations. The flowers that the storm had spared were gathered to\r\nornament the fountains, the altar, and the table, on which was placed an\r\nexcellent cold dinner, entirely prepared by themselves. Fritz supplied\r\nand roasted the game,—a fine bustard, the flesh of which resembles a\r\nturkey, and a brace of partridges. Ernest brought pines, melons, and\r\nfigs; Jack should have supplied the fish, but was able only to procure\r\noysters, crabs, and turtles’ eggs. Francis had the charge of the\r\ndessert, which consisted of a dish of strawberries, honeycomb, and the\r\ncream of the cocoa-nut. I had contributed a bottle of Canary wine, that\r\nwe might drink mamma’s health. All was arranged on a table in the middle\r\nof the _Franciade_, and my sons returned to accompany the\r\nexpedition next day.\r\n\r\nThe morning was beautiful, and the sun shone brightly on our emigration.\r\nMy wife was anxious to set out, expecting she should have to return to\r\nher aërial dwelling. Though her leg and foot were better, she still\r\nwalked feebly, and she begged us to harness the cow and ass to the cart,\r\nand to lead them as gently as possible.\r\n\r\n“I will only go a little way the first day,” said she, “for I am not\r\nstrong enough to visit Tent House yet.”\r\n\r\nWe felt quite convinced she would change her opinion when once in her\r\nlitter. I wished to carry her down the staircase; but she declined, and\r\ndescended very well with the help of my arm. When the door was opened,\r\nand she found herself once more in the open air, surrounded by her\r\nchildren, she thanked God, with tears of gratitude, for her recovery,\r\nand all his mercies to us. Then the pretty osier carriage arrived. They\r\nhad harnessed the cow and young bull to it; Francis answering for the\r\ndocility of Valiant, provided he guided him himself. Accordingly, he was\r\nmounted before, his cane in his hand, and his bow and quiver on his\r\nback, very proud to be mamma’s charioteer. My other three boys mounted\r\non their animals, were ready before, to form the advanced guard, while I\r\nproposed to follow, and watch over the whole. My wife was moved even to\r\ntears, and could not cease admiring her new carriage, which Fritz and\r\nJack presented to her as their own work. Francis, however, boasted that\r\nhe had carded the cotton for the soft cushion on which she was to sit,\r\nand I, that I had made it. I then lifted her in, and as soon as she was\r\nseated Ernest came to put her new bonnet on her head, which greatly\r\ndelighted her; it was of fine straw, and so thick and firm that it might\r\neven defend her from the rain. But what pleased her most was, that it\r\nwas the shape worn by the Swiss peasants in the Canton of Vaud, where my\r\ndear wife had resided some time in her youth. She thanked all her dear\r\nchildren, and felt so easy and comfortable in her new conveyance, that\r\nwe arrived at Family Bridge without her feeling the least fatigue. Here\r\nwe stopped.\r\n\r\n“Would you like to cross here, my dear?” said I; “and as we are very\r\nnear, look in at your convenient Tent House, where you will have no\r\nstaircase to ascend. And we should like to know, too, if you approve of\r\nour management of your garden,”\r\n\r\n“As you please,” said she; “in fact, I am so comfortable in my carriage,\r\nthat if it were necessary, I could make the tour of the island. I\r\nshould like to see my house again; but it will be so very hot at this\r\nseason, that we must not stay long.”\r\n\r\n“But you must dine there, my dear mother,” said Fritz; “it is too late\r\nto return to dinner at Falcon’s Nest; consider, too, the fatigue it\r\nwould occasion you.”\r\n\r\n“I would be very glad, indeed, my dear,” said she; “but what are we to\r\ndine on? We have prepared no provision, and I fear we shall all\r\nbe hungry.”\r\n\r\n“What matter,” said Jack, “provided you dine with us? You must take your\r\nchance. I will go and get some oysters, that we may not die with\r\nhunger;” and off he galloped on his buffalo. Fritz followed him, on some\r\npretence, on Lightfoot. Mamma wished she had brought a vessel to carry\r\nsome water from the river, for she knew we could get none at Tent House.\r\nFrancis reminded her we could milk the cow, and she was satisfied, and\r\nenjoyed her journey much. At last we arrived before the colonnade. My\r\nwife was dumb with wonder for some moments.\r\n\r\n“Where am I, and what do I see?” said she, when she could speak.\r\n\r\n“You see the _Franciade_, mamma,” said her little boy; “this beautiful\r\ncolonnade was my invention, to protect you from the heat; stay, read\r\nwhat is written above: _Francis to his dear mother. May this colonnade,\r\nwhich is called the Franciade, be to her a temple of happiness._ Now\r\nmamma, lean on me, and come and see my brothers’ gifts—much better than\r\nmine;” and he led her to Jack’s pavilion, who was standing by the\r\nfountain. He held a shell in his hand, which he filled with water, and\r\ndrank, saying, “To the health of the Queen of the Island; may she have\r\nno more accidents, and live as long as her children! Long live Queen\r\nElizabeth, and may she come every day to _Jackia_, to drink her son\r\nJack’s health.”\r\n\r\nI supported my wife, and was almost as much affected as herself. She\r\nwept and trembled with joy and surprise. Jack and Ernest then joined\r\ntheir hands, and carried her to the other pavilion, where Fritz was\r\nwaiting to receive her, and the same scene of tenderness ensued. “Accept\r\nthis pavilion, dear mother,” said he; “and may _Fritzia_ ever make you\r\nthink on Fritz.”\r\n\r\nThe delighted mother embraced them all, and observing Ernest’s name was\r\nnot commemorated by any trophy, thanked him again for her beautiful\r\nbonnet. She then drank some of the delicious water of the fountain, and\r\nreturned to seat herself at the repast, which was another surprise for\r\nher. We all made an excellent dinner; and at the dessert, I handed my\r\nCanary wine round in shells; and then Ernest rose and sung us very\r\nprettily, to a familiar air, some little verses he had composed:—\r\n\r\n     On this festive happy day,\r\n     Let us pour our grateful lay;\r\n     Since Heaven has hush’d our mother’s pain,\r\n     And given her to her sons again.\r\n     Then from this quiet, lovely home\r\n     Never, never, may we roam.\r\n     All we love around us smile:\r\n     Joyful is our desert isle.\r\n\r\n     When o’er our mother’s couch we bent,\r\n     Fervent prayers to Heaven we sent,\r\n     And God has spared that mother dear,\r\n     To bless her happy children here.\r\n     Then from this quiet, lovely home,\r\n     Never, never, may we roam;\r\n     All we love around us smile,\r\n     Joyful is our desert isle.\r\n\r\nWe all joined in the chorus, and none of us thought of the ship, of\r\nEurope, or of anything that was passing in the world. The island was our\r\nuniverse, and Tent House was a palace we would not have exchanged for\r\nany the world contained. This was one of those happy days that God\r\ngrants us sometimes on earth, to give us an idea of the bliss of Heaven;\r\nand most fervently did we thank Him, at the end of our repast, for all\r\nhis mercies and blessings to us.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, I told my wife she must not think of returning to Falcon’s\r\nNest, with all its risks of storms and the winding staircase, and she\r\ncould not better recompense her sons for their labours than by living\r\namong them. She was of the same opinion, and was very glad to be so near\r\nher kitchen and her stores, and to be able to walk alone with the\r\nassistance of a stick in the colonnade, which she could do already; but\r\nshe made me promise to leave Falcon’s Nest as it was. It would be a\r\npretty place to walk to, and besides, this castle in the air was her own\r\ninvention. We agreed that this very evening she should take possession\r\nof her own pretty room, with the good felt carpet, on which she could\r\nwalk without fear; and that the next day, I should go with my elder sons\r\nand the animals to bring the cart, such utensils as we needed, and above\r\nall, the poultry. Our dogs always followed their masters, as well as\r\nthe monkey and jackal, and they were so domesticated, we had no trouble\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nI then prevailed on my wife to go into her room and rest for an hour,\r\nafter which we were to visit the garden. She complied, and after her\r\nrepose found her four sons ready to carry her in her litter as in a\r\nsedan-chair. They took care to bring her straight to the grotto, where I\r\nwas waiting for her. This was a new surprise for the good mother. She\r\ncould not sufficiently express her astonishment and delight, when Jack\r\nand Francis, taking their flageolets, accompanied their brothers, who\r\nsung the following verse, which Ernest had added to his former attempt.\r\n\r\n     Dear mother, let this gift be mine,\r\n     Accept the Grotto Ernestine.\r\n     May all your hours be doubly blest\r\n     Within this tranquil place of rest.\r\n     Then from this quiet, lovely home\r\n     Never, never may we roam;\r\n     All we love around us smile.\r\n     Joyful is our desert isle!\r\n\r\nWhat cause had we to rejoice in our children! we could not but shed\r\ntears to witness their affection and perfect happiness.\r\n\r\nBelow the vase of flowers, on the block of salt, Ernest had written:—\r\n\r\n     Ernest, assisted by his brother Fritz,\r\n       Has prepared this grotto,\r\n     As a retreat for his beloved mother,\r\n       When she visits her garden.\r\n\r\nErnest then conducted his mother to one of the benches, which he had\r\ncovered with soft moss, as a seat for her, and there she rested at her\r\nease to hear the history of the discovery of the grotto. It was now my\r\nturn to offer my present; the garden, the embankment, the pond, and the\r\narbour. She walked, supported by my arm, to view her little empire, and\r\nher delight was extreme; the pond, which enabled her to water her\r\nvegetables, particularly pleased her, as well as her shady arbour, under\r\nwhich she found all her gardening tools, ornamented with flowers, and\r\naugmented by two light _watering-pans_, constructed by Jack and Francis,\r\nfrom two gourds. They had canes for spouts, with the gourd bottles at\r\nthe end, pierced with holes, through which the water came in the manner\r\nof a watering-pan. The embankment was also a great surprise; she\r\nproposed to place plants of pines and melon on it, and I agreed to it.\r\nTruly did she rejoice at the appearance of the vegetables, which\r\npromised us some excellent European provision, a great comfort to her.\r\nAfter expressing her grateful feelings, she returned to the grotto, and\r\nseating herself in her sedan-chair, returned to Tent House, to enjoy the\r\nrepose she needed, after such a day of excitement. We did not, however,\r\nlie down before we had together thanked God for the manifold blessings\r\nhe had given us, and for the pleasure of that day.\r\n\r\n“If I had been in Europe,” said my dear wife, “on the festival of my\r\nrecovery, I should have received a nosegay, a ribbon, or some trinket;\r\nhere I have had presented a carriage, a colonnade, pavilions, ornamental\r\nfountains, a large grotto, a garden, a pond, an arbour, and a\r\nstraw bonnet!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next and following days were spent in removing our furniture and\r\nproperty, particularly our poultry, which had multiplied greatly. We\r\nalso constructed a poultry-yard, at a sufficient distance from our house\r\nto save our sleep from disturbance, and still so near that we could\r\neasily tend them. We made it as a continuation of the colonnade, and on\r\nthe same plan, but enclosed in the front by a sort of wire trellis-work,\r\nwhich Fritz and Jack made wonderfully well. Fritz, who had a turn for\r\narchitecture and mechanics, gave me some good hints, especially one,\r\nwhich we put into execution. This was to carry the water from the basin\r\nof the fountain through the poultry-yard, which enabled us also to have\r\na little pond for our ducks. The pigeons had their abode above the\r\nhen-roosts, in some pretty baskets, which Ernest and Francis made,\r\nsimilar to those made by the savages of the Friendly Isles, of which\r\nthey had seen engravings in Cook’s Voyages. When all was finished, my\r\nwife was delighted to think that even in the rainy season she could\r\nattend to her feathered family and collect their eggs.\r\n\r\n“What a difference,” said she, admiring the elegance of our\r\nbuildings,—“what a difference between this Tent House and the original\r\ndwelling that suggested the name to us, and which was our only shelter\r\nfour years ago. What a surprising progress luxury has made with us in\r\nthat time! Do you remember, my dear, the barrel which served us for a\r\ntable, and the oyster-shells for spoons, the tent where we slept,\r\ncrowded together on dried leaves, and without undressing, and the river\r\nhalf a mile off, where we were obliged to go to drink if we were\r\nthirsty? Compared to what we were then, we are now great _lords_”\r\n\r\n“Kings, you mean, mamma,” said Jack, “for all this island is ours, and\r\nit is quite like a kingdom.”\r\n\r\n“And how many millions of subjects does Prince Jack reckon in the\r\nkingdom of his august father?” said I.\r\n\r\nPrince Jack declared he had not yet counted the parrots, kangaroos,\r\nagoutis, and monkeys. The laughter of his brothers stopped him. I then\r\nagreed with my wife that our luxuries had increased; but I explained to\r\nher that this was the result of our industry. All civilized nations have\r\ncommenced as we did; necessity has developed the intellect which God has\r\ngiven to man alone, and by degrees the arts have progressed, and\r\nknowledge has extended more perhaps than is conducive to happiness. What\r\nappeared luxury to us now was still simplicity compared with the luxury\r\nof towns, or even villages, among civilized nations. My wife declared\r\nshe had everything she wished for, and should not know what more to ask\r\nfor, as we now had only to rest and enjoy our happiness.\r\n\r\nI declared against spending our time in rest and indolence, as the sure\r\nmeans of ending our pleasure; and I well knew my dear wife was, like\r\nmyself, an enemy to idleness; but she dreaded any more laborious\r\nundertakings.\r\n\r\n“But, mamma,” said Fritz, “you must let me make a mill under the\r\ncascade; it will be so useful when our corn grows, and even now for the\r\nmaize. I also think of making an oven in the kitchen, which will be\r\nvery useful for you to bake your bread in.”\r\n\r\n“These would indeed be useful labours,” said the good mother, smiling;\r\n“but can you accomplish them?”\r\n\r\n“I hope so,” said Fritz, “with the help of God and that of my dear\r\nbrothers.”\r\n\r\nErnest promised his best aid, in return for his brother’s kind services\r\nin forming his grotto, only requesting occasional leisure for his\r\nnatural history collections. His mother did not see the utility of these\r\ncollections, but, willing to indulge her kind and attentive Ernest, she\r\noffered, till she could walk well, to assist him in arranging and\r\nlabelling his plants, which were yet in disorder, and he gratefully\r\nconsented. In procuring her some paper for the purpose, of which I had\r\nbrought a large quantity from the vessel, I brought out an unopened\r\npacket, amongst which was a piece of some fabric, neither paper nor\r\nstuff apparently. We examined it together, and at length remembered it\r\nwas a piece of stuff made at Otaheite, which our captain had bought of a\r\nnative at an island where we had touched on our voyage. Fritz appearing\r\nmuch interested in examining this cloth, Ernest said gravely, “I can\r\nteach you how to make it;” and immediately bringing _Cook’s Voyages_,\r\nwhere a detailed description is given, he proceeded to read it. Fritz\r\nwas disappointed to find it could only be made of the bark of three\r\ntrees—of these our island produced only one. These trees were the\r\nmulberry-tree, the bread-fruit, and the wild fig. We had the last in\r\nabundance, but of the two former we had not yet discovered a single\r\nplant. Fritz was not, however, discouraged. “They ought to be here,”\r\nsaid he, “since they are found in all the South Sea Islands. Perhaps we\r\nmay find them on the other side of the rocks, where I saw some superb\r\nunknown trees from the height where we discovered the grotto; and who\r\nknows but I may find my pretty gazelle there again. The rogue can leap\r\nbetter than I can over those rocks. I had a great wish to descend them,\r\nbut found it impossible; some are very high and perpendicular; others\r\nhave overhanging summits; I might, however, get round as you did by the\r\npass, between the torrent and the rocks at the Great Bay.”\r\n\r\nJack offered to be his guide, even with his eyes shut, into that rich\r\ncountry where he conquered and captured his buffalo; and Ernest begged\r\nto be of the party. As this was an expedition I had long projected, I\r\nagreed to accompany them next day, their mother being content to have\r\nFrancis left with her as a protector. I cautioned Fritz not to fire off\r\nhis gun when we approached the buffaloes, as any show of hostility might\r\nrender them furious; otherwise the animals, unaccustomed to man, have no\r\nfear of him, and will not harm him. “In general,” added I, “I cannot\r\nsufficiently recommend to you to be careful of your powder; we have not\r\nmore than will last us a year, and there may be a necessity to have\r\nrecourse to it for our defence.”\r\n\r\n“I have a plan for making it,” said Fritz, who never saw a difficulty in\r\nanything. “I know it is composed of charcoal, saltpetre, and\r\nsulphur—and we ought to find all these materials in the island. It is\r\nonly necessary to combine them, and to form it into little round\r\ngrains. This is my only difficulty; but I will consider it over; and I\r\nhave my mill to think on first. I have a confused recollection of a\r\npowder manufactory at Berne: there was some machinery which went by\r\nwater; this machinery moved some hammers, which pounded and mixed the\r\ningredients—was not this the case, father?”\r\n\r\n“Something like it,” said I; “but we have many things to do before\r\nmaking powder. First, we must go to sleep; we must set out before\r\ndaybreak, if we intend to return to-morrow evening.” We did indeed rise\r\nbefore the sun, which would not rise for us. The sky was very cloudy,\r\nand shortly we had an abundant and incessant rain, which obliged us to\r\ndefer our journey, and put us all in bad humour, but my wife, who was\r\nnot sorry to keep us with her, and who declared this gracious rain would\r\nwater her garden, and bring it forward. Fritz was the first who consoled\r\nhimself; he thought on nothing but building mills, and manufacturing\r\ngunpowder. He begged me to draw him a mill; this was very easy, so far\r\nas regards the exterior,—that is, the wheel, and the waterfall that\r\nsets it in motion; but the interior,—the disposition of the wheels, the\r\nstones to bruise the grain, the sieve, or bolter, to separate the flour\r\nfrom the bran; all this complicated machinery was difficult to explain;\r\nbut he comprehended all, adding his usual expression,—“I will try, and\r\nI shall succeed.” Not to lose any time, and to profit by this rainy day,\r\nhe began by making sieves of different materials, which he fastened to a\r\ncircle of pliant wood, and tried by passing through them the flour of\r\nthe cassava; he made some with sailcloth, others with the hair of the\r\nonagra, which is very long and strong, and some of the fibres of bark.\r\nHis mother admired his work, which he continued to improve more and\r\nmore; she assured him the sieve would be sufficient for her; it was\r\nuseless to have the trouble of building a mill.\r\n\r\n“But how shall we bruise the grain, mamma?” said he; “it would be\r\ntedious and hard work.”\r\n\r\n“And you think there will be no hard work in building your mill?” said\r\nJack. “I am curious to see how you will contrive to form that huge\r\nstone, which is called the millstone.”\r\n\r\n“You shall see,” said Fritz; “only find me the stone, and it shall soon\r\nbe done. Do you think, father, that of our rock would be suitable?”\r\n\r\nI told him I thought it would be hard enough, but it would be difficult\r\nto cut from the rock a piece large enough for the purpose. He made his\r\nusual reply,—“_I will try_. Ernest and Jack will assist me; and\r\nperhaps you, papa.”\r\n\r\nI declared my willingness, but named him the _master-mason;_ we must\r\nonly be his workmen. Francis was impatient to see the mill in operation.\r\n“Oh!” said Jack, “you shall soon have that pleasure. It is a mere\r\ntrifle; we only want stone, wood, tools, and science.”\r\n\r\nAt the word “_science_,” Ernest, who was reading in a corner, without\r\nlistening to us, raised his head suddenly, saying,—“What science are\r\nyou in need of?”\r\n\r\n“Of one you know nothing of, Mr. Philosopher,” said Jack. “Come, tell\r\nus, do you know how to build a mill?”\r\n\r\n“A mill?” answered Ernest; “of what description? There are many sorts.\r\nI was just looking in my dictionary for it. There are corn-mills, and\r\npowder-mills, oil-mills, wind-mills, water-mills, hand-mills, and\r\nsaw-mills; which do you want?”\r\n\r\nFritz would have liked them all.\r\n\r\n“You remind me,” said I, “that we brought from the vessel a hand-mill\r\nand a saw-mill, taken to pieces, to be sure, but numbered and labelled,\r\nso that they could be easily united: they should be in the magazine,\r\nwhere you found the anvil and iron bars; I had forgotten them.”\r\n\r\n“Let us go and examine them,” said Fritz, lighting his lantern; “I shall\r\nget some ideas from them.”\r\n\r\n“Rather,” said his mother, “they will spare you the trouble of thinking\r\nand labouring.”\r\n\r\nI sent them all four to seek these treasures, which, heaped in an\r\nobscure corner of the store-room, had escaped my recollection. When we\r\nwere alone, I seriously besought my wife not to oppose any occupations\r\nour children might plan, however they might seem beyond their power; the\r\ngreat point being, to keep them continually occupied, so that no evil or\r\ndangerous fancies might fill their minds. “Let them,” I said, “cut\r\nstone, fell trees, or dig fountains, and bless God that their thoughts\r\nare so innocently directed.” She understood me, and promised not to\r\ndiscourage them, only fearing the excessive fatigue of these\r\nundertakings.\r\n\r\nOur boys returned from the magazine, delighted with what they had found,\r\nand loaded with work-tools. Those of the masons,—the chisel, the short\r\nhammer, and the trowel, were not to be found, and rarely are taken out\r\nto sea; but they had collected a great number of carpenters’\r\ntools,—saws, planes, rules, &c. And now that Fritz was a smith, he had\r\nno difficulty in making any tool he wanted. He was loaded on each\r\nshoulder, and in each hand he brought a specimen of gunpowder; one sort\r\nwas in good condition, and they had found a barrel of it; the other was\r\nmuch damaged by the water. Jack and Francis were also bending under the\r\nweight of various articles; among which I saw some pieces of the\r\nhand-mill Fritz wished to examine. Ernest, always rather idle, came\r\nproudly on, with a leather belt across his shoulders, to which was\r\nsuspended a large tin box for plants, and a leather portmanteau for\r\nstones, minerals, and shells. His brothers, even Francis, rallied him\r\nunmercifully on his immense burden; one offered to help him, another to\r\ngo and bring the ass; he preserved his grave and thoughtful air, and\r\nextended himself on a seat near his mother, who was occupied with his\r\nspecimens of natural history. Jack deposited his load in a corner, and\r\nran out; we soon saw him return with a huge screw-machine on his head,\r\nwhich he placed before Ernest, saying, with an air of respect,—\r\n\r\n“I have the honour to bring for his Highness the Prince of the Idle\r\nPenguins, the press for his august plants, which his Highness doubtless\r\nfound too heavy; and, truly, it is no little weight.”\r\n\r\nErnest did not know whether to thank him or to be angry, but he decided\r\nto join in the jest, and, therefore, answered gravely that he was\r\ndistressed that his Highness the Prince of the Monkeys should have taken\r\nso much trouble to oblige him, that he ought to have employed some of\r\nhis docile subjects to do it; after all, he confessed that the press,\r\nwhich he had not noticed, gave him great pleasure, and he placed some\r\nplants in it immediately, which he had collected the evening before.\r\n\r\nThe rain ceasing for a short time, I went with Fritz and Jack to examine\r\nour embankment, and to open the sluices of the pond. We found all right,\r\nand our garden looking beautiful after the rain. On our return, we\r\nlooked in at the _Grotto Ernestine_, which we found inundated from the\r\nopening above. We proposed to make a trench, or little channel, to carry\r\noff the rain-water from it. We returned home, and retired to bed, in\r\nhopes of being able to set out next morning. We were, however, again\r\ndisappointed, and for a longer period than we expected. The rain\r\ncontinued some days, and the country was again a complete lake; we had,\r\nhowever, no storm or wind, and our possessions did not suffer; so we\r\nresolved to wait patiently till the weather would permit us to go. My\r\nwife was delighted to be in her comfortable abode, and to have us round\r\nher; neither did we waste the time. Ernest finished the arrangement of\r\nhis collection with his mother and Francis. Fritz and Jack prepared the\r\ntools that would be wanted in their great undertaking—the first attempt\r\nwas to be a saw-mill. In order to prepare the planks they wished, a very\r\nlarge saw, which they had found amongst the tools, would serve their\r\npurpose; but it was necessary to set it in motion by water, and here was\r\nthe difficulty. Fritz made several models from the thin wood of our\r\nchests, and the wheels of our guns, but they were too small. In the\r\nmean time, the mind of my young mechanic was exercised, his ideas were\r\nenlarged and improved; and, as this science was so necessary in our\r\nsituation, I allowed him to go on with his experiments. Notwithstanding\r\nthe rain, protected by my cloak, he went several times to the cascade to\r\nlook out for a place where he should place his mills to the best\r\nadvantage, and have a constant supply of water. Ernest assisted him by\r\nhis advice, and promised his labour when it should be needed. Jack and\r\nFrancis were helping their mother to card cotton, of which she had made\r\na large collection, intending to spin it for our clothing; and I\r\nexercised my mechanical talents in turning a large wheel for her, which\r\nit was necessary should revolve very easily, her leg being still stiff;\r\nand a reel, by which four bobbins were filled at once by turning\r\na handle.\r\n\r\nThese different occupations aided us to pass the rainy season, which\r\nvisited us earlier this year, and did not remain so long. My wife knew\r\nsomething of dyeing cloth; and, some of the plants she had helped Ernest\r\nto dry having left their colour on the papers, she made some\r\nexperiments, and succeeded in obtaining a very pretty blue to dye our\r\nclothes with; and, with the cochineal from our fig-tree, a beautiful red\r\nbrown, with which she had dyed for herself a complete dress.\r\n\r\nThus passed several weeks. Ernest read to us from some amusing or\r\ninstructive work every evening; and, when his collections were all put\r\nin order, he worked at his lathe, or at the business of weaving. At last\r\nthe sun appeared; we spent some days enjoying it in our delightful\r\ncolonnade. We went to visit the grotto and the garden, where all was\r\ngoing on well—the embankment had prevented the inundation. Satisfied\r\nwith our work, we now fixed our departure for the next day, once more\r\nhoping the rain would not come again to disappoint us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day the weather was delightful. We rose before daybreak. My\r\neldest sons took their work-tools, which we might want, and their guns\r\nalso, but under the condition that they should not use them till I gave\r\nthe word, “Fire!” I carried the bag of provisions. Our flock of sheep\r\nhad increased so much at the farm, that we allowed ourselves to kill\r\none, and my wife had roasted a piece for us the preceding evening; to\r\nthis we added a cake of cassava, and for our dessert we depended on the\r\nfruits of the trees we might discover. But, previous to our departure,\r\nwhile I was taking leave of my wife and Francis, I heard a dispute in\r\nthe colonnade, which I hastened to learn the cause of. I found it was a\r\nquestion between Fritz and Jack, whether we should make the tour of the\r\nisland by sea or land; and each was anxious for my support. Fritz\r\ncomplained that, since their two expeditions in the canoe, Jack believed\r\nhimself the first sailor in the world, and that they had given him the\r\nname of Lord of the Waves, because he was constantly saying—“When I was\r\nunder the waves—when the waves were washing over me, do you think that\r\nthey left me dry?”\r\n\r\n“No, Mr. Sportsman,” said Jack, “you got enough of them, and that’s the\r\nreason you don’t wish to try them again. For my part, I love the waves,\r\nand I sing, ‘The sea! the sea! it was the sea that brought us here!’”\r\n\r\n“What a boaster you are,” said Fritz: “it was only yesterday you said to\r\nme, ‘I will guide you; I know the way by the rocks; I got my buffalo\r\nthere, and I intend to have another.’ Was it in the pinnace you intended\r\nto pass the defile, and pursue buffaloes?”\r\n\r\n“No, no! I meant on foot,” said Jack; “but I thought we should be only\r\ntwo then. But, as we are four—papa at the helm, and three bold rowers,\r\nwhy should we fatigue ourselves in making the tour of the island on our\r\nlegs, when we have a good vessel to carry us? What says Mr. Philosopher,\r\nthe prince of idlers, to it?”\r\n\r\n“For my part,” said Ernest, quietly, “I am quite indifferent whether I\r\nuse my legs in walking, or my arms in rowing, it is equally fatiguing;\r\nbut walking gives me more chance of filling my plant-box and my\r\ngame-bag.”\r\n\r\n“And does he think,” added Fritz, “that the mulberry and bread-fruit\r\ntrees, which we shall certainly find on the other side, grow on the sea?\r\nwithout naming my gazelle, which does not run over the waves.”\r\n\r\n“No, it is waiting, without moving, for you to shoot it,” said Jack;\r\n“and Ernest, perhaps you may find on the sea some of those curious\r\nthings half plants, half animals, which you were showing me in a book.”\r\n\r\n“The zoophytes, or polypi; for they are the same family, though there\r\nare more than a thousand species,” said Ernest, charmed to display his\r\nknowledge; but I stopped him by saying: “We will dispense with the\r\nthousand names at present. After hearing all your arguments, attend to\r\nmine; even Jack must yield to them. Our principal aim now being to\r\nsearch for the trees we are in need of, and to examine the productions\r\nof the island, our most sensible plan will be to walk.”\r\n\r\nJack still contended that we might land occasionally; but I showed him\r\nthe danger of this, the island being, in all probability, surrounded by\r\nreefs, which might extend so far into the sea as to take us out of the\r\nsight of the island; this I intended to ascertain some day; and in the\r\nmean time I proposed to them that we should endeavour to find a pass\r\nround the rocks on our side, from whence we could walk to the defile at\r\nthe other end, take our canoe, which we had left at anchor near the\r\nGreat Bay, and return to Tent House.\r\n\r\nJack was in ecstasies; he declared the pass must be very well concealed\r\nthat escaped his search, and, seizing his lasso and his bow, rushed out\r\nthe first, singing “The sea! the sea!”\r\n\r\n“There goes a sailor formed by nature,” thought I, as we followed the\r\ncourse of the chain of rocks to the left of our dwelling. It conducted\r\nus first to the place of our landing, that little uncultivated plain of\r\ntriangular form, of which the base was washed by the sea, and the point\r\nwas lost among the rocks. I found here some traces of our first\r\nestablishment; but how wretched all appeared, compared with our present\r\ncomforts! We tried here in vain to find a passage to cross the\r\nrocks—the chain was everywhere like an impenetrable wall. We arrived at\r\nthe ravine Fritz and Ernest had scaled when they discovered their\r\ngrotto; and, truly, nothing but the courage and rashness of youth could\r\nhave undertaken this enterprise, and continued it daily for three weeks.\r\nIt appeared to me almost impossible; Fritz offered to ascend, to show me\r\nhow they accomplished it; but I would not consent, as it could serve no\r\nuseful purpose. I thought it better for us to proceed to the border of\r\nthe island, where it was not impossible there might be a small space on\r\nthe strand between the rocks and the sea, round which we could pass;\r\nfrom my sons being able to distinguish from the summit the country on\r\nthe other side, it was evident the chain of rocks could not be very\r\nbroad. Suddenly Fritz struck his forehead, and, seizing Ernest by the\r\narm—“Brother,” said he, “what fools we have been!”\r\n\r\nErnest inquired what folly they had been guilty of.\r\n\r\n“Why did we not,” said Fritz, “when we were working within our grotto,\r\nattempt to make the opening on the other side? We should not have had\r\nmuch difficulty, I am persuaded, and if our tools had not been\r\nsufficient, a little powder would have opened us a door on the other\r\nside. Only consider, father, the convenience of bringing the cart loaded\r\nwith the trees we wanted through our grotto, and to be able to go\r\na-hunting without having I don’t know how many miles to go.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we can still do that,” said Ernest, in his usual calm, grave\r\nmanner; “if we do not find another passage, we will make one through the\r\nGrotto Ernestine, with mamma’s permission, as it is her property.”\r\n\r\nThis idea of my son appeared good. It was quite certain, from our\r\nexperience at Tent House and in the grotto, that the cavity in the rocks\r\nwas of very great extent, and it did not appear difficult to pierce\r\nthrough to the other side; but some other chain of rocks, some gigantic\r\ntree, some hill, at the end of our tunnel, might render all our labour\r\nuseless. I proposed that we should defer our work till we had examined\r\nthe nature of the ground on the other side; my sons agreed, and we\r\nproceeded with renewed courage, when we were suddenly checked by the\r\nsight of the sea beating against a perpendicular rock of terrific\r\nheight, which terminated our island on this side, and did not give us a\r\nchance of going on. I saw the rock did not extend far; but how to get\r\nround it, I could not devise. I did not conceive we could get the\r\npinnace round, as the coast seemed surrounded by reefs; masses of rock\r\nstood up in the sea, and the breakers showed that more were hidden.\r\nAfter much consideration and many plans, Ernest proposed that we should\r\nswim out to the uncovered rocks, and endeavour to pass round. Fritz\r\nobjected, on account of his arms and ammunition; but Ernest suggested\r\nthat the powder should be secured in the pockets of his clothes, which\r\nhe might carry on his head, holding his gun above the water.\r\n\r\nWith some difficulty we arranged our incumbrances, and succeeded in\r\nreaching the range of outer rocks, without swimming, as the water was\r\nnot above our shoulders. We rested here awhile, and, putting on some of\r\nour clothes, we commenced our walk over sharp stones, which wounded our\r\nfeet. In many places, where the rocks lay low, we were up to the waist\r\nin the water. Ernest, the proposer of the plan, encouraged us, and led\r\nthe way for some time; but at last he fell behind, and remained so long,\r\nthat I became alarmed, and calling aloud, for I had lost sight of him,\r\nhe answered me, and at last I discovered him stretched on the rock,\r\nendeavouring to separate a piece from it with his knife.\r\n\r\n“Father,” said he, “I am now certain that this bed of rocks, over which\r\nwe are walking, and which we fancied was formed of stone or flints, is\r\nnothing but the work of those remarkable zoophytes, called coral\r\ninsects, which form coral and many other extraordinary things; they can\r\neven make whole islands. Look at these little points and hollows, and\r\nthese stars of every colour and every form; I would give all the world\r\nto have a specimen of each kind.”\r\n\r\nHe succeeded in breaking off a piece, which was of a deep orange-colour\r\ninside; he collected also, and deposited in his bag, some other pieces,\r\nof various forms and colours. These greatly enriched his collection;\r\nand, idle as he was, he did not complain of any difficulty in obtaining\r\nthem. He had given his gun to Jack, who complained much of the\r\nruggedness of our road. Our march was truly painful, and I repented more\r\nthan once of having yielded to the idea; besides the misery of walking\r\nalong these shelly rocks, which presented points like the sharp teeth of\r\na saw, tearing our shoes and even our skin, the sea, in some of the\r\nlower places, was so high as to bar our passage, and we were obliged, in\r\nthe interval between two waves, to rush across, with the water to our\r\nchins. We had some difficulty to avoid being carried away. I trembled\r\nespecially for Jack; though small and light, he preferred facing the\r\nwave to avoiding it. I was several times obliged to catch hold of him,\r\nand narrowly escaped destruction along with him. Happily, our march was\r\nnot above half a mile, and we gained the shore at last without any\r\nserious accident, but much fatigued and foot-sore; and we made a\r\nresolution never more to cross the coral reefs.\r\n\r\nAfter dressing ourselves, resting, and taking a slight refreshment on\r\nthe beach, we resumed our march more at our ease into the interior of\r\nthe island; but though the long grass was not so sharp as the coral, it\r\nwas almost as troublesome, twisting round our legs, and threatening to\r\nthrow us down every step we took. Ernest, loaded with his bag of\r\nfragments of rock, coral, and zoophytes, had given his gun to Jack; and,\r\nfearing an accident among the long grass, I thought it prudent to\r\ndischarge it. In order to profit by it, I fired at a little quadruped,\r\nabout the size of a squirrel, and killed it. It appeared to me to be the\r\nanimal called by naturalists the palm-squirrel, because it climbs the\r\ncocoa and date-palms, hooks itself by its tail, which is very long and\r\nflexible, to the upper branches, and feeds at pleasure on the fruit, of\r\nwhich it is very fond. We amused ourselves by details of the habits of\r\nthis animal, occasionally separating to make more discoveries, but\r\nagreeing on a particular call, which was to assemble us when\r\nnecessary,—a precaution by no means useless, as it turned out.\r\n\r\nFritz, with his head raised, went on examining all the trees, and\r\noccasionally giving a keen look after his gazelle. Ernest, stooping\r\ndown, examined plants, insects, and, occasionally pursuing rare and\r\nbeautiful butterflies, was filling his bag and plant-box with various\r\ncuriosities. Jack, with his lasso in his hand, prepared himself to fling\r\nit round the legs of the first buffalo he met with, and was vexed that\r\nhe did not see any. For my own part, I was engaged in surveying the\r\nchain of rocks, in order to discover that which contained the Grotto\r\nErnestine. It was easy to recognize it, from its summit cleft in two;\r\nand I wished to ascertain, as nearly as possible, if the cleft extended\r\nto the base of the rock, as this would render our work much easier. This\r\nside of the island did not resemble that near the Great Bay, with which\r\nJack and I had been so much charmed. The island was much narrower here,\r\nand instead of the wide plain, crossed by a river, divided by delightful\r\nwoods, giving an idea of paradise on earth; we were journeying through a\r\ncontracted valley, lying between the rocky wall which divided the\r\nisland, and a chain of sandy hills, which hid the sea and sheltered the\r\nvalley from the wind. Fritz and I ascended one of these hills, on which\r\na few pines and broom were growing, and perceived beyond them a barren\r\ntract, stretching to the sea, where the coral reefs rose to the level of\r\nthe water, and appeared to extend far into the sea. Any navigators,\r\nsailing along these shores, would pronounce the island inaccessible and\r\nentirely barren. This is not the fact; the grass is very thick, and the\r\ntrees of noble growth; we found many unknown to us, some loaded with\r\nfruit; also, several beautiful shrubs covered with flowers; the dwarf\r\norange-tree, the elegant melaleuca, the nutmeg-tree, and the Bengal rose\r\nblending its flowers with the fragrant jasmine. I should never finish,\r\nif I were to try and name all the plants found in this shady valley,\r\nwhich might be called the botanic garden of Nature. Ernest was in\r\necstasies; he wished to carry away everything, but he did not know how\r\nto dispose of them.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said he, “if only our grotto were open to this side!”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Fritz came running out of breath, crying out, “The\r\nbread-fruit tree! I have found the bread-fruit tree! Here is the\r\nfruit,—excellent, delicious bread. Taste it, father; here, Ernest;\r\nhere, Jack;” and he gave us each a part of an oval fruit, about the size\r\nof an ordinary melon, which really seemed very good and nourishing.\r\n\r\n“There are many of these trees,” continued he, “loaded with fruit. Would\r\nthat we had our grotto opened, that we might collect a store of them,\r\nnow that they are ripe.”\r\n\r\nMy boys pointed out to me exactly the situation of the grotto, judging\r\nfrom the rock above, and longed for their tools, that they might\r\ncommence the opening directly. We proceeded to make our way through a\r\nborder of trees and bushes, that separated us from the rock, that we\r\nmight examine it, and judge of the difficulties of our undertaking. Jack\r\npreceded us, as usual, after giving Ernest his gun; Fritz followed him,\r\nand suddenly turning to me, said,—\r\n\r\n“I believe kind Nature has saved us much trouble; the rock appears to be\r\ndivided from top to bottom; at the foot I see a sort of cave, or grotto,\r\nalready made.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “We saw at the entrance of the cave two large brown\r\nbears.”]\r\n\r\nAt this moment Jack uttered a piercing cry, and came running to us,\r\nhis lasso in his hand: “Two monstrous beasts!” cried he. “Help! help!”\r\nWe rushed forward, our guns ready, and saw at the entrance of the cave\r\ntwo large brown bears. The black bear, whose fur is most valued, is\r\nonly found in cold and mountainous countries; but the brown prefers\r\nthe south. It is a carnivorous animal, considered very ferocious. The\r\nblack bear lives only on vegetables and honey. Of these, the one I\r\njudged to be the female seemed much irritated, uttering deep growls,\r\nand furiously gnashing her teeth. As I knew something of these animals,\r\nhaving met with them on the Alps, I remembered having heard that a\r\nsharp whistling terrifies and checks them. I therefore whistled as long\r\nand loudly as I could, and immediately saw the female retire backwards\r\ninto the cave, while the male, raising himself on his hind legs, stood\r\nquite still, with his paws closed. My two elder sons fired into his\r\nbreast: he fell down, but being only wounded, turned furiously on\r\nus. I fired a third shot at him, and finished him. We then hastened\r\nto load our guns again, to be ready to receive his companion. Jack\r\nwished to use his lasso; but I explained to him that the legs of the\r\nbear were too short and thick for such a measure to be successful. He\r\nrelated to us, that having entered the cave, he saw something moving\r\nat the bottom; he took up a stone, and threw it with all his strength\r\nat the object; immediately he heard a frightful growling, and saw two\r\nlarge beasts coming towards him; he had barely time to escape and call\r\nfor help, and then to hide himself behind a tree. To save ourselves\r\nfrom the other bear, it was necessary that we should take some prompt\r\nmeasures; we therefore advanced, and formed a line of battle before\r\nthe entrance of the cave, I then gave the word—Fire! and we all three\r\nfired off our pieces at the same moment. A ferocious roar made us hope\r\nthe bullets had taken effect but to make sure, and to prevent the\r\nescape of the animal if it was still living, we gathered a large heap\r\nof dried branches and leaves before the opening, to which I set fire.\r\nAs soon as it blazed, we saw by the light the bear laid motionless\r\non its side, but it is well known that this animal is crafty enough\r\nsometimes to feign itself dead till its enemy approaches near enough to\r\nbe in its power, when it seizes him in its enormous paws and strangles\r\nhim. We took a lighted branch, and approached with great precaution.\r\nThe cave did not extend far; the animal was lying on a heap of dried\r\nleaves prepared for its young ones. I ascertained that it was really\r\ndead. I then, with the assistance of my sons, drew it out of the\r\ncave which was too dark for work, and I wished to secure the rich\r\nand beautiful skins which might be useful to us in winter. We set to\r\nwork, and, as the animals were still warm, we succeeded more easily\r\nthan I could have expected, but the skins were so heavy it was almost\r\nimpossible to remove them. We therefore left them in the cave, the\r\nbottom of which was sandy, closing the entrance with boughs that no\r\nanimal might enter to devour them, and abandoned the two bodies, only\r\nregretting the abundance of fat which would have been useful for many\r\ndomestic purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe resumed our search, thanking God for our preservation from this\r\ndanger, in which my dear Jack at any rate, might have perished. As a\r\nproof and trophy of our adventure, we cut off the fore paws of the\r\nanimal, to carry to my wife. It is said that these form a very delicious\r\ndish, fit for the table of a king. The valley now began to expand, and\r\npresented a more varied appearance. It was intersected with beautiful\r\nplains or savannas, of which the grass had evidently been eaten, and\r\nwith more extensive woods, through which we had great difficulty in\r\nforcing a passage; so thick and entangled were the lianas and underwood.\r\nWe succeeded in passing them by keeping at the borders, where we also\r\nfelt in greater safety from the wild beasts and reptiles, of which we\r\nsaw many species that had their abode at the foot of the rocks. Besides\r\nthe fatigue of our journey, we were tormented with thirst, never having\r\nseen any water since we left the sea. The soil was so moist, that I was\r\nof opinion we might have found water by digging; but having been\r\ncompelled to leave our spades when we came along the reef, we had no\r\ntools suitable for the purpose. We were also impatient to wash ourselves\r\nafter the butchery of the bears, when, to our great satisfaction, we\r\nheard the murmur of waters, which I concluded was the river Jack and I\r\nhad seen in our former expedition. He had frequently inquired about it,\r\nand we had foolishly thought it had extended along the whole valley,\r\nwhich could not be. It was a gentle stream, gushing from a perpendicular\r\nrock, which reminded me of the source of the river Orbe, in the Canton\r\nof Vaud; it issued forth in its full width, rolling at first over a\r\nrocky bed; then forming a graceful bend, it took its course towards the\r\ngreat bay, and fell in a cascade into the sea. We remained some time\r\nhere to fill our gourds, drinking moderately, and taking a bath, which\r\nrefreshed us all greatly.\r\n\r\nThe evening was approaching, and we began to fear we should not reach\r\nhome before night. I had warned my wife that there was a possibility\r\nthat we might be delayed, though I could not then anticipate the cause\r\nof our delay. We endeavoured, however, by walking as quickly as we\r\ncould, and resting no more, to reach our farm at any rate. We followed\r\nthe course of the river, on the opposite shore of which rose a wide\r\nplain, where we saw the herd of buffaloes quietly grazing, ruminating,\r\nand drinking, without paying the slightest attention to us. We thought\r\nwe distinguished some other quadrupeds amongst them, which Fritz was\r\ncertain were zebras or onagras; but certainly not his dear gazelle, for\r\nwhich he had incessantly looked round. Jack was in despair that the\r\nriver separated us from the buffaloes, so that he could not cast his\r\nlasso round the legs of one of them, as he had promised Ernest. He even\r\nwished to swim across the stream, to have a hunt; but I forbade him,\r\nencouraging him to hope that perhaps a single buffalo might cross to our\r\nside, and throw itself in the way of his lasso. I was far from wishing\r\nsuch a thing myself, for we had no time to lose, nor any means to\r\nsecure and lead it home, should we succeed in capturing one, not having\r\nany cords with us; and moreover, intending to return from the bay in the\r\ncanoe. When we arrived at the bay, the night, which comes on rapidly in\r\nequinoctial countries, had almost closed. We were scarcely able to see,\r\nwithout terror, the changes that the late storm had occasioned; the\r\nnarrow pass which led from the other side of the island, between the\r\nriver and a deep stream that flowed from the rocks, was entirely\r\nobstructed with rocks and earth fallen upon it; and to render our\r\npassage practicable, it was necessary to undertake a labour that the\r\ndarkness now prevented, and which would at any time be attended by\r\ndanger. We were obliged then to spend the night in the open air, and\r\nseparated from our dear and anxious friends at Tent House. Fortunately,\r\nFritz had collected a store of bread-fruit for his mother, with which he\r\nhad filled his own pockets and those of his brothers. These, with water\r\nfrom the river, formed our supper; for we had nothing but the bone of\r\nour leg of mutton left. We turned back a little way, to establish\r\nourselves under a clump of trees, where we were in greater safety; we\r\nloaded our muskets, we kindled a large fire of dry branches, and\r\nrecommending ourselves to the protection of God, we lay ourselves down\r\non the soft moss to wait for the first rays of light. With the exception\r\nof Jack, who from the first slept as if he had been in his bed, we none\r\nof us could rest. The night was beautiful; a multitude of stars shone\r\nover our heads in the ethereal vault. Ernest was never tired of gazing\r\non them. After some questions and suppositions on the plurality of\r\nworlds, their courses and their distances, he quitted us to wander on\r\nthe borders of the river, which reflected them in all their brilliancy.\r\nFrom this night his passion for astronomy commenced, a passion which he\r\ncarried beyond all others. This became his favourite and continual\r\nstudy, nor did he fall far short of Duval, whose history he had read.\r\nWhilst he was engaged in contemplation, Fritz and I conversed on our\r\nprojects for tunnelling to the grotto, and on the utility of such a\r\npassage, as this side of the island was quite lost to us, from the\r\ndifficulty in reaching it. “And yet,” said I, “it is to this difficulty\r\nwe owe the safety we have enjoyed. Who can say that the bears and the\r\nbuffaloes may not find the way through the grotto? I confess I am not\r\ndesirous of their visits, nor even of those of the onagras. Who knows\r\nbut they might persuade your favourite Lightfoot to return and live\r\namongst them? Liberty has many charms. Till now, we have been very happy\r\non our side of the island, without the productions of this. My dear boy,\r\nthere is a proverb, ‘Let _well_ alone,’ Let us not have too much\r\nambition,—it has ruined greater states than ours.”\r\n\r\nFritz seemed grieved to give up his plan, and suggested that he could\r\nforge some strong bars of iron to place before the opening, which could\r\nbe removed at will.\r\n\r\n“But,” said I, “they will not prevent the snakes from passing\r\nunderneath. I have noticed some with terror, as they are animals I have\r\na great antipathy to; and if your mother saw one crawl into her grotto,\r\nshe would never enter it again; even if she did not die of fright.”\r\n\r\n“Well, we must give it up,” said Fritz; “but it is a pity. Do you\r\nthink, father, there are more bears in the island than those we killed?”\r\n\r\n“In all probability,” said I; “it is scarcely to be supposed that there\r\nshould only be two. I cannot well account for their being here. They can\r\nswim very well, and perhaps the abundance of fruit in this part of the\r\nisland may have attracted them.” I then gave my son a short account of\r\ntheir manners and habits, from the best works on the history of\r\nthese animals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst we continued to talk and to admire the beauty of the stars, they\r\nat length began to fade away before the first light of morning. Ernest\r\nreturned to us, and we awoke Jack, who had slept uninterruptedly, and\r\nwas quite unconscious where he was. We returned to the pass, which now,\r\nby the light of day, seemed to us in a more hopeless state than in the\r\ndusk of evening. I was struck with consternation: it appeared to me that\r\nwe were entirely enclosed at this side; and I shuddered to think of\r\ncrossing the island again, to pass round at the other end, of the risk\r\nwe should run of meeting wild beasts, and of the painful and perilous\r\npassage along the coral reefs. At that moment I would gladly have\r\nconsented to open a passage through the grotto, at the hazard of any\r\nvisitors, in order to get through myself, that I might relieve the\r\nanxious feelings of my dear wife and boy. The thoughts of their agony\r\nunnerved me, and took away all courage for the commencement of a labour\r\nwhich seemed impossible, our only utensils being a small saw, and a\r\nlittle dibble for taking up plants, which Ernest had been unwilling to\r\nleave behind us. The path by which Jack and I had passed was covered\r\nwith rocks and masses of soil, which obstructed even the course of the\r\nstream; we could not discover the place we had forded, the river had\r\nopened itself a wider course, far beyond its former one.\r\n\r\n“It is impossible,” said Fritz, gazing on the ruins, “that we can remove\r\nall these immense stones without proper tools; but, perhaps, with a\r\nlittle courage, we may cross over them, the rivulet being widened cannot\r\nbe very deep. At all events, it cannot be worse than the coral reefs.”\r\n\r\n“Let us try; but I fear it will be impossible, at least for _him_,” said\r\nI, pointing to Jack.\r\n\r\n“_Him_, indeed, papa, and why not?” said the bold fellow; “_he_ is\r\nperhaps as strong, and more active, than some of _them_; ask Fritz what\r\nhe thinks of his workman. Shall I go the first to show you the way?”\r\n\r\nAnd he was advancing boldly, but I checked him, and said, that before we\r\nundertook to scale these masses of rock, absolutely bare, where we had\r\nnothing to support us, or to hold by, it would be as well to examine if,\r\nby descending lower, we could not find a less dangerous road. We\r\ndescended to the narrow pass, and found our drawbridge, plantation, all\r\nour fortification that my boys were so proud of, and where, at Fritz’s\r\nrequest, I had even planted a small cannon, all, all destroyed; the\r\ncannon swallowed up with the rest. My boys deplored their\r\ndisappointment; but I showed them how useless such a defence must ever\r\nbe. Nature had provided us with a better fortification than we could\r\nconstruct, as we just now bitterly experienced.\r\n\r\nWe had descended several yards lower with incredible difficulty, plunged\r\nin a wet, heavy soil, and obliged to step across immense stones, when\r\nFritz, who went first, cried out, joyfully—\r\n\r\n“The roof, papa! the roof of our _chalet_! it is quite whole; it will be\r\na bridge for us if we can only get to it.”\r\n\r\n“What roof? What chalet?” said I, in astonishment.\r\n\r\n“The roof of our little hermitage,” said he, “which we had covered so\r\nwell with stones, like the Swiss _chalets_.”\r\n\r\nI then recollected that I had made this little hut, after the fashion of\r\nthe Swiss chalet, of bark, with a roof nearly flat and covered with\r\nstones, to secure it against the winds. It was this circumstance, and\r\nits situation, that had saved it in the storm. I had placed it opposite\r\nthe cascade, that we might see the fall in all its beauty, and,\r\nconsequently, a little on one side of the passage filled up by the fall\r\nof the rocks. Some fragments reached the roof of the hut, and we\r\ncertainly could not have entered it; but the chalet was supported by\r\nthis means, and the roof was still standing and perfectly secure. We\r\ncontrived to slide along the rock which sustained it; Jack was the first\r\nto stand on the roof and sing victory. It was very easy to descend on\r\nthe other side, holding by the poles and pieces of bark, and we soon\r\nfound ourselves safe in our _own_ island. Ernest had lost his gun in\r\nthe passage: not being willing to resign his bag of curiosities, he had\r\ndropped the gun into the abyss.\r\n\r\n“You may take the gun I left in the canoe,” said Fritz; “but, another\r\ntime, throw away your stones, and keep your gun—you will find it a good\r\nfriend in need.”\r\n\r\n“Let us embark in our canoe,” cried Jack. “The sea! the sea! Long live\r\nthe waves! they are not so hard as the stones.”\r\n\r\nI was very glad to have the opportunity of conveying my canoe back to\r\nthe port of Tent House; our important occupations had prevented me till\r\nnow, and everything favoured the plan: the sea was calm, the wind\r\nfavourable, and we should arrive at home sooner, and with less fatigue,\r\nthan by land. We skirted the great Bay to the Cabbage-palm Wood. I had\r\nmoored the canoe so firmly to one of the palms, that I felt secure of it\r\nbeing there. We arrived at the place, and no canoe was there! The mark\r\nof the cord which fastened it was still to be seen round the tree, but\r\nthe canoe had entirely disappeared. Struck with astonishment, we looked\r\nat each other with terror, and without being able to articulate a word.\r\nWhat was become of it?\r\n\r\n“Some animal,—the jackals; a monkey, perhaps,—might have detached it,”\r\nsaid Jack; “but they could not have eaten the canoe.” And we could not\r\nfind a trace of it, any more than of the gun Fritz had left in it.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary circumstance gave me a great deal of thought.\r\nSavages, surely, had landed on our island, and carried off our canoe. We\r\ncould no longer doubt it when we discovered on the sands the print of\r\nnaked feet! It is easy to believe how uneasy and agitated I was. I\r\nhastened to take the road to Tent House, from which we were now more\r\nthan three leagues distant. I forbade my sons to mention this event, or\r\nour suspicions, to their mother, as I knew it would rob her of all peace\r\nof mind. I tried to console myself. It was possible that chance had\r\nconducted them to the Bay, that they had seen our pretty canoe, and\r\nthat, satisfied with their prize, and seeing no inhabitants, they might\r\nnot return. Perhaps, on the contrary, these islanders might prove kind\r\nand humane, and become our friends. There was no trace of their\r\nproceedings further than the shore. We called at _The Farm_, on purpose\r\nto examine. All appeared in order; and certainly, if they had reached\r\nhere, there was much to tempt them: our cotton mattresses, our osier\r\nseats, and some household utensils that my wife had left here. Our geese\r\nand fowls did not appear to have been alarmed, but were pecking about as\r\nusual for worms and insects. I began to hope that we might get off with\r\nthe loss of our canoe,—a loss which might be repaired. We were a\r\nsufficient number, being well armed, not to be afraid of a few savages,\r\neven if they penetrated further into the island, and showed hostile\r\nintentions. I exhorted my sons to do nothing to irritate them; on the\r\ncontrary, to meet them with kindness and attention, and to commit no\r\nviolence against them unless called on to defend their lives. I also\r\nrecommended them to select from the wrecked chest, some articles likely\r\nto please the savages, and to carry them always about with them. “And I\r\nbeseech you, once more,” added I, “not to alarm your mother.” They\r\npromised me; and we continued our road unmolested to Falcon’s Nest. Jack\r\npreceded us, delighted, he said, to see our castle again, which he hoped\r\nthe savages had not carried away. Suddenly, we saw him return, running,\r\nwith terror painted on his countenance.\r\n\r\n“They are there!” said he; “they have taken possession of it; our\r\ndwelling is full of them. Oh! how frightful they are! What a blessing\r\nmamma is not there; she would have died of fright to see them enter.”\r\n\r\nI confess I was much agitated; but, not wishing to expose my children to\r\ndanger before I had done all in my power to prevent it, I ordered them\r\nto remain behind till I called them. I broke a branch from a tree\r\nhastily, which I held in one hand, and in the other some long nails,\r\nwhich I found by chance in the bottom of my pocket; and I advanced thus\r\nto my Tree-Castle. I expected to have found the door of my staircase\r\ntorn open and broken, and our new guests ascending and descending; but I\r\nsaw at once it was closed as I had left it; being of bark, it was not\r\neasily distinguished. How had these savages reached the dwelling, forty\r\nfeet from the ground? I had placed planks before the great opening; they\r\nwere no longer there; the greater part of them had been hurled down to\r\nthe ground, and I heard such a noise in our house, that I could not\r\ndoubt Jack’s report. I advanced timidly, holding up in the air the\r\nbranch and my offerings, when I discovered, all at once, that I was\r\noffering them to a troop of monkeys, lodged in the fortress, which they\r\nwere amusing themselves by destroying. We had numbers of them in the\r\nisland; some large and mischievous, against whom we had some difficulty\r\nin defending ourselves when crossing the woods, where they principally\r\ndwelt. The frequent report of fire-arms round our dwelling had kept them\r\naloof till now, when, emboldened by our absence, and enticed by the figs\r\non our tree, they had come in crowds. These vexatious animals had got\r\nthrough the roof, and, once in, had thrown down the planks that covered\r\nthe opening; they made the most frightful grimaces, throwing down\r\neverything they could seize.\r\n\r\nAlthough this devastation caused me much vexation, I could not help\r\nlaughing at their antics, and at the humble and submissive manner in\r\nwhich I had advanced to pay homage to them. I called my sons, who\r\nlaughed heartily, and rallied “_the prince of the monkeys_” without\r\nmercy, for not knowing his own subjects. Fritz wished much to discharge\r\nhis gun amongst them, but I forbade him. I was too anxious to reach Tent\r\nHouse, to be able to turn my thoughts on these depredators just now.\r\n\r\nWe continued our journey—but I pause here; my heart is oppressed. My\r\nfeelings when I reached home require another chapter to describe them,\r\nand I must summon courage for the task.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe soon arrived at Family Bridge, where I had some hopes of meeting\r\nFrancis, and perhaps his mother, who was beginning to walk very well;\r\nbut I was disappointed—they were not there. Yet I was not uneasy, for\r\nthey were neither certain of the hour of our return, nor of the way we\r\nmight take. I expected, however, to find them in the colonnade—they\r\nwere not there. I hastily entered the house; I called aloud, “Elizabeth!\r\nFrancis! where are you?” No one answered. A mortal terror seized me—and\r\nfor a moment I could not move.\r\n\r\n“They will be in the grotto,” said Ernest.\r\n\r\n“Or in the garden,” said Fritz.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps on the shore,” cried Jack; “my mother likes to watch the waves,\r\nand Francis may be gathering shells.”\r\n\r\nThese were possibilities. My sons flew in all directions in search of\r\ntheir mother and brother. I found it impossible to move, and was obliged\r\nto sit down. I trembled, and my heart beat till I could scarcely\r\nbreathe. I did not venture to dwell on the extent of my fears, or,\r\nrather, I had no distinct notion of them. I tried to recover myself. I\r\nmurmured, “Yes—at the grotto, or the garden—they will return\r\ndirectly.” Still, I could not compose myself. I was overwhelmed with a\r\nsad presentiment of the misfortune which impended over me. It was but\r\ntoo soon realized. My sons returned in fear and consternation. They had\r\nno occasion to tell me the result of their search; I saw it at once,\r\nand, sinking down motionless, I cried, “Alas! they are not there!”\r\n\r\nJack returned the last, and in the most frightful state; he had been at\r\nthe sea-shore, and, throwing himself into my arms, he sobbed out—\r\n\r\n“The savages have been here, and carried away my mother and Francis;\r\nperhaps they have devoured them; I have seen the marks of their\r\nhorrible feet on the sands, and the print of dear Francis’s boots.”\r\n\r\nThis account at once recalled me to strength and action.\r\n\r\n“Come, my children, let us fly to save them. God will pity our sorrow,\r\nand assist us. He will restore them. Come, come!”\r\n\r\nThey were ready in a moment. But a distracting thought seized me. Had\r\nthey carried off the pinnace? if so, every hope was gone. Jack, in his\r\ndistress, had never thought of remarking this; but, the instant I named\r\nit, Fritz and he ran to ascertain the important circumstance, Ernest, in\r\nthe mean time, supporting me, and endeavouring to calm me.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” said he, “they are still in the island. Perhaps they may have\r\nfled to hide themselves in some wood, or amongst the reeds. Even if the\r\npinnace be left, it would be prudent to search the island from end to\r\nend before we leave it. Trust Fritz and me, we will do this; and, even\r\nif we find them in the hands of the enemy, we will recover them. Whilst\r\nwe are off on this expedition, you can be preparing for our voyage, and\r\nwe will search the world from one end to the other, every country and\r\nevery sea, but we will find them. And we shall succeed. Let us put our\r\nwhole trust in God. He is our Father, he will not try us beyond our\r\nstrength.”\r\n\r\nI embraced my child, and a flood of tears relieved my overcharged heart.\r\nMy eyes and hands were raised to Heaven; my silent prayers winged their\r\nflight to the Almighty, to him who tries us and consoles us. A ray of\r\nhope seemed to visit my mind, when I heard my boys cry out, as they\r\napproached—\r\n\r\n“The pinnace is here! they have not carried that away!”\r\n\r\nI fervently thanked God—it was a kind of miracle; for this pretty\r\nvessel was more tempting than the canoe. Perhaps, as it was hidden in a\r\nlittle creek between the rocks, it had escaped their observation;\r\nperhaps they might not know how to manage it; or they might not be\r\nnumerous enough. No matter, it was there, and might be the means of our\r\nrecovering the beloved objects those barbarians had torn from us. How\r\ngracious is God, to give us hope to sustain us in our afflictions!\r\nWithout hope, we could not live; it restores and revives us, and, even\r\nif never realized below, accompanies us to the end of our life, and\r\nbeyond the grave!\r\n\r\nI imparted to my eldest son the idea of his brother, that they might be\r\nconcealed in some part of the island; but I dared not rely on this sweet\r\nhope. Finally, as we ought not to run the risk of abandoning them, if\r\nthey were still here, and perhaps in the power of the savages, I\r\nconsented that my two eldest sons should go to ascertain the fact.\r\nBesides, however impatient I was, I felt that a voyage such as we were\r\nundertaking into unknown seas might be of long duration, and it was\r\nnecessary to make some preparations—I must think on food, water, arms,\r\nand many other things. There are situations in life which seize the\r\nheart and soul, rendering us insensible to the wants of the body—this\r\nwe now experienced. We had just come from a painful journey, on foot, of\r\ntwenty-four hours, during which we had had little rest, and no sleep.\r\nSince morning we had eaten nothing but some morsels of the bread-fruit;\r\nit was natural that we should be overcome with fatigue and hunger. But\r\nwe none of us had even thought of our own state—we were supported, if I\r\nmay use the expression, by our despair. At the moment that my sons were\r\ngoing to set out, the remembrance of their need of refreshment suddenly\r\noccurred to me, and I besought them to rest a little, and take\r\nsomething; but they were too much agitated to consent. I gave Fritz a\r\nbottle of Canary, and some slices of roast mutton I met with, which he\r\nput in his pocket. They had each a loaded musket, and they set out,\r\ntaking the road along the rocks, where the most hidden retreats and most\r\nimpenetrable woods lay; they promised me to fire off their pieces\r\nfrequently to let their mother know they were there, if she was hidden\r\namong the rocks—they took also one of the dogs. Flora we could not\r\nfind, which made us conclude she had followed her mistress, to whom she\r\nwas much attached.\r\n\r\nAs soon as my eldest sons had left us, I made Jack conduct me to the\r\nshore where he had seen the footmarks, that I might examine them, to\r\njudge of their number and direction. I found many very distinct, but so\r\nmingled, I could come to no positive conclusion. Some were near the sea,\r\nwith the foot pointing to the shore; and amongst these Jack thought he\r\ncould distinguish the boot-mark of Francis. My wife wore very light\r\nboots also, which I had made for her; they rendered stockings\r\nunnecessary, and strengthened her ankles. I could not find the trace of\r\nthese; but I soon discovered that my poor Elizabeth had been here, from\r\na piece torn from an apron she wore, made of her own cotton, and dyed\r\nred. I had now not the least doubt that she was in the canoe with her\r\nson. It was a sort of consolation to think they were together; but how\r\nmany mortal fears accompanied this consolation! Oh! was I ever to see\r\nagain these objects of my tenderest affection!\r\n\r\nCertain now that they were not in the island, I was impatient for the\r\nreturn of my sons, and I made every preparation for our departure. The\r\nfirst thing I thought of was the wrecked chest, which would furnish me\r\nwith means to conciliate the savages, and to ransom my loved ones. I\r\nadded to it everything likely to tempt them; utensils, stuffs, trinkets;\r\nI even took with me gold and silver coin, which was thrown on one side\r\nas useless, but might be of service to us on this occasion. I wished my\r\nriches were three times as much as they were, that I might give all in\r\nexchange for the life and liberty of my wife and son. I then turned my\r\nthoughts on those remaining to me: I took, in bags and gourds, all that\r\nwe had left of cassava bread, manioc roots, and potatoes; a barrel of\r\nsalt-fish, two bottles of rum, and several jars of fresh water. Jack\r\nwept as he filled them at his fountain, which he perhaps might never see\r\nagain, any more than his dear Valiant, whom I set at liberty, as well as\r\nthe cow, ass, buffalo, and the beautiful onagra. These docile animals\r\nwere accustomed to us and our attentions, and they remained in their\r\nplaces, surprised that they were neither harnessed nor mounted. We\r\nopened the poultry-yard and pigeon-cote. The flamingo would not leave\r\nus, it went and came with us from the house to the pinnace. We took\r\nalso oil, candles, fuel, and a large iron pot to cook our provisions in.\r\nFor our defence, I took two more guns, and a small barrel of powder, all\r\nwe had left. I added besides some changes of linen, not forgetting some\r\nfor my dear wife, which I hoped might be needed. The time fled rapidly\r\nwhile we were thus employed; night came on, and my sons returned not. My\r\ngrief was inconceivable; the island was so large and woody, that they\r\nmight have lost themselves, or the savages might have returned and\r\nencountered them. After twenty hours of frightful terror, I heard the\r\nreport of a gun—alas! only _one_ report! it was the signal agreed on if\r\nthey returned alone; _two_ if they brought their mother; _three_ if\r\nFrancis also accompanied them; but I expected they would return alone,\r\nand I was still grateful. I ran to meet them; they were overcome with\r\nfatigue and vexation.\r\n\r\nThey begged to set out immediately, not to lose one precious moment;\r\nthey were now sure the island did not contain those they lamented, and\r\nthey hoped I would not return without discovering them, for what would\r\nthe island be to us without our loved ones? Fritz, at that moment, saw\r\nhis dear Lightfoot capering round him, and could not help sighing as he\r\ncaressed him, and took leave of him.\r\n\r\n“May I find thee here,” said he, “where I leave thee in such sorrow; and\r\nI will bring back thy young master,” added he, turning to the bull, who\r\nwas also approaching him.\r\n\r\nHe then begged me again to set out, as the moon was just rising in all\r\nher majesty.\r\n\r\n“The queen of night,” said Ernest; “will guide us to the queen of our\r\nisland, who is perhaps now looking up to her, and calling on us to\r\nhelp her.”\r\n\r\n“Most assuredly,” said I, “she is thinking on us; but it is on God she\r\nis calling for help. Let us join her in prayer, my dear children, for\r\nherself and our dear Francis.”\r\n\r\nThey fell on their knees with me, and I uttered the most fervent and\r\nearnest prayer that ever human heart poured forth; and I rose with\r\nconfidence that our prayers were heard. I proceeded with new courage to\r\nthe creek that contained our pinnace, where Jack arranged all we had\r\nbrought; we rowed out of the creek, and when we were in the bay, we held\r\na council to consider on which side we were to commence our search. I\r\nthought of returning to the great bay, from whence our canoe had been\r\ntaken; my sons, on the contrary, thought that these islanders, content\r\nwith their acquisition, had been returning homewards, coasting along the\r\nisland, when an unhappy chance had led their mother and brother to the\r\nshore, where the savages had seen them, and carried them off. At the\r\nmost, they could but be a day before us; but that was long enough to\r\nfill us with dreadful anticipations. I yielded to the opinion of my\r\nsons, which had a great deal of reason on its side, besides the wind was\r\nfavourable in that direction; and, abandoning ourselves in full\r\nconfidence to Almighty God, we spread our sails, and were soon in\r\nthe open sea.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nA gentle wind swelled our sails, and the current carried us rapidly into\r\nthe open sea. I then seated myself at the helm, and employed the little\r\nknowledge I had gained during our voyage from Europe in directing our\r\nbark, so that we might avoid the rocks and coral banks that surrounded\r\nour island. My two oldest sons, overcome with fatigue, had no sooner\r\nseated themselves on a bench, than they fell into a profound sleep,\r\nnotwithstanding their sorrows. Jack held out the best; his love of the\r\nsea kept him awake, and I surrendered the helm to him till I took a\r\nmomentary slumber, my head resting against the stern. A happy dream\r\nplaced me in the midst of my family in our dear island; but a shout from\r\nErnest awoke me, he was calling on Jack to leave the helm, as he was\r\ncontriving to run the vessel among the breakers on the coast. I seized\r\nthe helm, and soon set all right, determined not to trust my giddy\r\nson again.\r\n\r\nJack, of all my sons, was the one who evinced most taste for the sea;\r\nbut being so young when we made our voyage, his knowledge of nautical\r\naffairs was very scanty. My elder sons had learnt more. Ernest, who had\r\na great thirst for knowledge of every kind, had questioned the pilot on\r\nall he had seen him do. He had learned a great deal in theory, but of\r\npractical knowledge he had none. The mechanical genius of Fritz had\r\ndrawn conclusions from what he saw; this would have induced me to place\r\nmuch trust in him in case of that danger which I prayed Heaven might be\r\naverted. What a situation was mine for a father! Wandering through\r\nunknown and dangerous seas with my three sons, my only hope, in search\r\nof a fourth, and of my beloved helpmate; utterly ignorant which way we\r\nshould direct our course, or where to find a trace of those we sought.\r\nHow often do we allay the happiness granted us below by vain wishes! I\r\nhad at one time regretted that we had no means of leaving our island;\r\nnow we had left it, and our sole wish was to recover those we had lost,\r\nto bring them back to it, and never to leave it more. I sometimes\r\nregretted that I had led my sons into this danger. I might have ventured\r\nalone; but I reflected that I could not have left them, for Fritz had\r\nsaid, “If the savages had carried off the pinnace, I would have swum\r\nfrom isle to isle till I had found them.” My boys all endeavoured to\r\nencourage and console me. Fritz placed himself at the rudder, observing\r\nthat the pinnace was new and well built, and likely to resist a tempest.\r\nErnest stood on the deck silently watching the stars, only breaking his\r\nsilence by telling me he should be able by them to supply the want of\r\nthe compass, and point out how we should direct our course. Jack climbed\r\ndexterously up the mast to let me see his skill; we called him the\r\ncabin-boy, Fritz was the pilot, Ernest the astronomer, and I was the\r\ncaptain and commander of the expedition. Daybreak showed us we had\r\npassed far from our island, which now only appeared a dark speck. I, as\r\nwell as Fritz and Jack, was of opinion that it would be advisable to go\r\nround it, and try our fortune on the opposite coast; but Ernest, who\r\nhad not forgotten his telescope, was certain he saw land in a direction\r\nhe pointed out to us. We took the glass, and were soon convinced he was\r\nright. As day advanced, we saw the land plainly, and did not hesitate to\r\nsail towards it.\r\n\r\nAs this appeared the land nearest to our island, we supposed the savages\r\nmight have conveyed their captives there. But more trials awaited us\r\nbefore we arrived there. It being necessary to shift the sail, in order\r\nto reach the coast in view, my poor cabin-boy, Jack, ran up the mast,\r\nholding by the ropes; but before he reached the sail, the rope which he\r\nheld broke suddenly; he was precipitated into the sea, and disappeared\r\nin a moment; but he soon rose to the surface, trying to swim, and\r\nmingling his cries with ours. Fritz, who was the first to see the\r\naccident, was in the water almost as soon as Jack, and seizing him by\r\nthe hair, swam with the other hand, calling on him to try and keep\r\nafloat, and hold by him. When I saw my two sons thus struggling with the\r\nwaves, that were very strong from a land-wind, I should, in my despair,\r\nhave leaped in after them; but Ernest held me, and implored me to remain\r\nto assist in getting them into the pinnace. He had thrown ropes to them,\r\nand a bench which he had torn up with the strength of despair. Fritz had\r\ncontrived to catch one of the ropes and fasten it round Jack, who still\r\nswam, but feebly, as if nearly exhausted. Fritz had been considered an\r\nexcellent swimmer in Switzerland; he preserved all his presence of mind,\r\ncalling to us to draw the rope gently, while he supported the poor boy,\r\nand pushed him towards the pinnace. At last I was able to reach and\r\ndraw him up; and when I saw him extended, nearly lifeless, at the bottom\r\nof the pinnace, I fell down senseless beside him. How precious to us now\r\nwas the composed mind of Ernest! In the midst of such a scene, he was\r\ncalm and collected; promptly disengaging the rope from the body of Jack,\r\nhe flung it back to Fritz, to help him in reaching the pinnace,\r\nattaching the other end firmly to the mast. This done, quicker than I\r\ncan write it, he approached us, raised his brother so that he might\r\nrelieve himself from the quantity of water he had swallowed; then\r\nturning to me, restored me to my senses by administering to me some\r\ndrops of rum, and by saying, “Courage, father! you have saved Jack, and\r\nI will save Fritz. He has hold of the rope; he is swimming strongly; he\r\nis coming; he is here!”\r\n\r\nHe left me to assist his brother, who was soon in the vessel, and in my\r\narms. Jack, perfectly recovered, joined him; and fervently did I thank\r\nGod for granting me, in the midst of my trials, such a moment of\r\nhappiness. We could not help fancying this happy preservation was an\r\naugury of our success in our anxious search, and that we should bring\r\nback the lost ones to our island.\r\n\r\n“Oh, how terrified mamma would have been,” said Jack, “to see me sink! I\r\nthought I was going, like a stone, to the bottom of the sea; but I\r\npushed out my arms and legs with all my strength, and up I rose.”\r\n\r\nHe as well as Fritz was quite wet. I had by chance brought some changes\r\nof clothes, which I made them put on, after giving each a little rum.\r\nThey were so much fatigued, and I was so overcome by my agitation, that\r\nwe were obliged to relinquish rowing, most unwillingly, as the skies\r\nthreatened a storm. We gradually began to distinguish clearly the island\r\nwe wished to approach; and the land-birds, which came to rest on our\r\nsails, gave us hopes that we should reach it before night; but,\r\nsuddenly, such a thick fog arose, that it hid every object from us, even\r\nthe sea itself, and we seemed to be sailing among the clouds. I thought\r\nit prudent to drop our anchor, as, fortunately, we had a tolerably\r\nstrong one; but there appeared so little water, that I feared we were\r\nnear the breakers, and I watched anxiously for the fog to dissipate, and\r\npermit us to see the coast. It finally changed into a heavy rain, which\r\nwe could with difficulty protect ourselves from; there was, however, a\r\nhalf-deck to the pinnace, under which we crept, and sheltered ourselves.\r\nHere, crowded close together, we talked over the late accident. Fritz\r\nassured me he was never in any danger, and that he would plunge again\r\ninto the sea that moment, if he had the least hope that it would lead\r\nhim to find his mother and Francis. We all said the same; though Jack\r\nconfessed that his friends, the waves, had not received his visit very\r\npolitely, but had even beat him very rudely.\r\n\r\n“But I would bear twice as much,” said he, “to see mamma and dear\r\nFrancis again. Do you think, papa, that the savages could ever hurt\r\nthem? Mamma is so good, and Francis is so pretty! and then, poor mamma\r\nis so lame yet; I hope they would pity her, and carry her.”\r\n\r\nAlas! I could not hope as my boy did; I feared that they would force her\r\nto walk. I tried to conceal other horrible fears, that almost threw me\r\ninto despair. I recalled all the cruelties of the cannibal nations, and\r\nshuddered to think that my Elizabeth and my darling child were perhaps\r\nin their ferocious hands. Prayer and confidence in God were the only\r\nmeans, not to console, but to support me, and teach me to endure my\r\nheavy affliction with resignation. I looked on my three sons, and\r\nendeavoured, for their sakes, to hope and submit. The darkness rapidly\r\nincreased, till it became total; we concluded it was night. The rain\r\nhaving ceased, I went out to strike a light, as I wished to hang the\r\nlighted lantern to the mast, when Ernest, who was on deck, called out\r\nloudly, “Father! brothers! come! the sea is on fire!” And, indeed, as\r\nfar as the eye could reach, the surface of the water appeared in flames;\r\nthis light, of the most brilliant, fiery red, reached even to the\r\nvessel, and we were surrounded by it. It was a sight at once beautiful,\r\nand almost terrific. Jack seriously inquired, if there was not a volcano\r\nat the bottom of the sea; and I astonished him much by telling him, that\r\nthis light was caused by a kind of marine animals, which in form\r\nresembled plants so much, that they were formerly considered such; but\r\nnaturalists and modern voyagers have entirely destroyed this error, and\r\nfurnished proofs that they are organized beings, having all the\r\nspontaneous movements peculiar to animals. They feel when they are\r\ntouched, seek for food, seize and devour it; they are of various kinds\r\nand colours, and are known under the general name of zoophytes.\r\n\r\n“And this which glitters in such beautiful colours on the sea, is called\r\n_pyrosoma_,” said Ernest. “See, here are some I have caught in my hat;\r\nyou may see them move. How they change colour—orange, green, blue, like\r\nthe rainbow; and when you touch them, the flame appears still more\r\nbrilliant; now they are pale yellow.”\r\n\r\nThey amused themselves some time with these bright and beautiful\r\ncreatures, which appear to have but a half-life. They occupied a large\r\nspace on the water, and their astonishing radiance, in the midst of the\r\ndarkness of the atmosphere, had such a striking and magnificent effect,\r\nthat for a few moments we were diverted from our own sad thoughts; but\r\nan observation from Jack soon recalled them.\r\n\r\n“If Francis passed this way,” said he, “how he would be amused with\r\nthese funny creatures, which look like fire, but do not burn; but I know\r\nhe would be afraid to touch them; and how much afraid mamma would be, as\r\nshe likes no animals she does not know. Ah! how glad I shall be to tell\r\nher all about our voyage, and my excursion into the sea, and how Fritz\r\ndragged me by the hair, and what they call these fiery fishes; tell me\r\nagain, Ernest; py—py—”\r\n\r\n“Pyrosoma, Mr. Peron calls them,” said Ernest. “The description of them\r\nis very interesting in his voyage, which I have read to mamma; and as\r\nshe would recollect it, she would not be afraid.”\r\n\r\n“I pray to God,” replied I, “that she may have nothing more to fear than\r\nthe pyrosoma, and that we may soon see them again, with her\r\nand Francis.”\r\n\r\nWe all said Amen; and, the day breaking, we decided to weigh the anchor,\r\nand endeavour to find a passage through the reefs to reach the island,\r\nwhich we now distinctly saw, and which seemed an uncultivated and rocky\r\ncoast. I resumed my place at the helm, my sons took the oars, and we\r\nadvanced cautiously, sounding every minute. What would have become of us\r\nif our pinnace had been injured! The sea was perfectly calm, and, after\r\nprayer to God, and a slight refreshment, we proceeded forward, looking\r\ncarefully round for any canoe of the savages—it might be, even our own;\r\nbut, no! we were not fortunate enough to discover any trace of our\r\nbeloved friends, nor any symptom of the isle being inhabited; however,\r\nas it was our only point of hope, we did not wish to abandon it. By dint\r\nof searching, we found a small bay, which reminded us of our own. It was\r\nformed by a river, broad and deep enough for our pinnace to enter. We\r\nrowed in; and having placed our vessel in a creek, where it appeared to\r\nbe secure, we began to consider the means of exploring the whole island.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nI did not disembark on this unknown shore without great emotion: it\r\nmight be inhabited by a barbarous and cruel race, and I almost doubted\r\nthe prudence of thus risking my three remaining children in the\r\nhazardous and uncertain search after our dear lost ones. I think I could\r\nhave borne my bereavement with Christian resignation, if I had seen my\r\nwife and child die in my arms; I should then have been certain they were\r\nhappy in the bosom of their God; but to think of them in the power of\r\nferocious and idolatrous savages, who might subject them to cruel\r\ntortures and death, chilled my very blood. I demanded of my sons, if\r\nthey felt courage to pursue the difficult and perilous enterprise we had\r\ncommenced. They all declared they would rather die than not find their\r\nmother and brother. Fritz even besought me, with Ernest and Jack, to\r\nreturn to the island, in case the wanderers should come back, and be\r\nterrified to find it deserted; and to leave him the arms, and the means\r\nof trafficking with the savages, without any uneasiness about his\r\nprudence and discretion.\r\n\r\nI assured him I did not distrust his courage and prudence, but I showed\r\nhim the futility of hoping that the savages would voluntarily carry back\r\ntheir victims, or that they could escape alone. And should he meet with\r\nthem here, and succeed, how could he carry his recovered treasures to\r\nthe island?\r\n\r\n“No, my children,” said I, “we will all search, in the confidence that\r\nGod will bless our efforts.”\r\n\r\n“And perhaps sooner than we think,” said Ernest. “Perhaps they are in\r\nthis island.”\r\n\r\nJack was running off immediately to search, but I called my little\r\nmadcap back, till we arranged our plans. I advised that two of us should\r\nremain to watch the coast, while the other two penetrated into the\r\ninterior. The first thing necessary to ascertain was if the island was\r\ninhabited, which might easily be done, by climbing some tree that\r\noverlooked the country, and remarking if there were any traces of the\r\nnatives, any huts, or fires lighted, &c. Those who made any discovery\r\nwere immediately to inform the rest, that we might go in a body to\r\nrecover our own. If nothing announced that the island was inhabited, we\r\nwere to leave it immediately, to search elsewhere. All wished to be of\r\nthe party of discovery. At length, Ernest agreed to remain with me, and\r\nwatch for any arrivals by sea. Before we parted, we all knelt to invoke\r\nthe blessing of God on our endeavours. Fritz and Jack, as the most\r\nactive, were to visit the interior of the island, and to return with\r\ninformation as soon as possible. To be prepared for any chance, I gave\r\nthem a game-bag filled with toys, trinkets, and pieces of money, to\r\nplease the savages; I also made them take some food. Fritz took his gun,\r\nafter promising me he would not fire it, except to defend his life, lest\r\nhe should alarm the savages, and induce them to remove their captives.\r\nJack took his lasso, and they set out with our benedictions, accompanied\r\nby the brave Turk, on whom I depended much to discover his mistress and\r\nhis companion Flora, if she was still with her friends.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were out of sight, Ernest and I set to work to conceal\r\nas much as possible our pinnace from discovery. We lowered the masts,\r\nand hid with great care under the deck the precious chest with our\r\ntreasure, provisions, and powder. We got our pinnace with great\r\ndifficulty, the water being low, behind a rock, which completely\r\nconcealed it on the land-side, but it was still visible from the sea.\r\nErnest suggested that we should entirely cover it with branches of\r\ntrees, so that it might appear like a heap of bushes; and we began to\r\ncut them immediately with two hatchets we found in the chest, and which\r\nwe speedily fitted with handles. We found also a large iron staple,\r\nwhich Ernest succeeded, with a hammer and pieces of wood, in fixing in\r\nthe rock to moor the pinnace to. We had some difficulty in finding\r\nbranches within our reach; there were many trees on the shore, but their\r\ntrunks were bare. We found, at last, at some distance, an extensive\r\nthicket, composed of a beautiful shrub, which Ernest recognized to be a\r\nspecies of mimosa. The trunk of this plant is knotty and stunted, about\r\nthree or four feet high, and spreads its branches horizontally, clothed\r\nwith beautiful foliage, and so thickly interwoven, that the little\r\nquadrupeds who make their dwellings in these thickets are obliged to\r\nopen covered roads out of the entangled mass of vegetation.\r\n\r\nAt the first blow of the hatchet, a number of beautiful little creatures\r\npoured forth on all sides. They resembled the kangaroos of our island,\r\nbut were smaller, more elegant, and remarkable for the beauty of their\r\nskin, which was striped like that of the zebra.\r\n\r\n“It is the striped kangaroo,” cried Ernest, “described in the voyages of\r\nPeron. How I long to have one. The female should have a pouch to contain\r\nher young ones.”\r\n\r\nHe lay down very still at the entrance of the thicket, and soon had the\r\nsatisfaction of seizing two, which leaped out almost into his arms. This\r\nanimal is timid as the hare of our country. They endeavoured to escape,\r\nbut Ernest held them fast. One was a female, which had her young one in\r\nher pouch, which my son took out very cautiously. It was an elegant\r\nlittle creature, with a skin like its mother, only more brilliant—it\r\nwas full of graceful antics. The poor mother no longer wished to escape;\r\nall her desire seemed to be to recover her offspring, and to replace it\r\nin its nest. At last, she succeeded in seizing and placing it carefully\r\nin security. Then her desire to escape was so strong, that Ernest could\r\nscarcely hold her. He wished much to keep and tame her, and asked my\r\npermission to empty one of the chests for a dwelling for her, and to\r\ncarry her off in the pinnace; but I refused him decidedly. I explained\r\nto him the uncertainty of our return to the island, and the imprudence\r\nof adding to our cares, and, “certainly,” added I, “you would not wish\r\nthis poor mother to perish from famine and confinement, when your own\r\nmother is herself a prisoner?”\r\n\r\nHis eyes filled with tears, and he declared he would not be such a\r\nsavage as to keep a poor mother in captivity. “Go, pretty creature,”\r\nsaid he, releasing her, “and may my mother be as fortunate as you.” She\r\nsoon profited by his permission, and skipped off with her treasure.\r\n\r\nWe continued to cut down the branches of the mimosa; but they were so\r\nentangled, and the foliage so light, that we agreed to extend our search\r\nfor some thicker branches.\r\n\r\nAs we left the shore, the country appeared more fertile: we found many\r\nunknown trees, which bore no fruit; but some covered with delicious\r\nflowers. Ernest was in his element, he wanted to collect and examine\r\nall, to endeavour to discover their names, either from analogy to other\r\nplants, or from descriptions he had read. He thought he recognized the\r\n_melaleuca_, several kinds of _mimosa_, and the Virginian pine, which\r\nhas the largest and thickest branches. We loaded ourselves with as much\r\nas we could carry, and, in two or three journeys, we had collected\r\nsufficient to cover the vessel, and to make a shelter for ourselves, if\r\nwe were obliged to pass the night on shore. I had given orders to my\r\nsons that both were to return before night, at all events; and if the\r\nleast hope appeared, one was to run with all speed to tell us. All my\r\nfear was that they might lose their way in this unknown country: they\r\nmight meet with lakes, marshes, or perplexing forests; every moment I\r\nwas alarmed with the idea of some new danger, and never did any day seem\r\nso long. Ernest endeavoured, by every means in his power, to comfort and\r\nencourage me; but the buoyancy of spirit, peculiar to youth, prevented\r\nhim dwelling long on one painful thought. He amused his mind by turning\r\nto search for the marine productions with which the rocks were covered:\r\nsea-weed, mosses of the most brilliant colours, zoophytes of various\r\nkinds, occupied his attention. He brought them to me, regretting that he\r\ncould not preserve them.\r\n\r\n“Oh! if my dear mother could see them,” said he, “or if Fritz could\r\npaint them, how they would amuse Francis!”\r\n\r\nThis recalled our sorrows, and my uneasiness increased.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll was so still around us, and our pinnace was so completely hidden\r\nwith its canopy of verdure, that I could not help regretting that I had\r\nnot accompanied my sons. It was now too late, but my steps\r\ninvoluntarily turned to the road I had seen them take, Ernest remaining\r\non the rocks in search of natural curiosities; but I was suddenly\r\nrecalled by a cry from Ernest—\r\n\r\n“Father, a canoe! a canoe!”\r\n\r\n“Alas! is it not ours?” I said, rushing to the shore, where, indeed, I\r\nsaw beyond the reefs a canoe, floating lightly, apparently filled with\r\nthe islanders, easy to distinguish from their dark complexion. This\r\ncanoe did not resemble ours; it was longer, narrower, and seemed to be\r\ncomposed of long strips of bark, quite rough, tied together at each end,\r\nwhich gave somewhat of a graceful form to it, though it evidently\r\nbelonged to the infancy of the art of navigation. It is almost\r\ninconceivable how these frail barks resist the slightest storm; but\r\nthese islanders swim so well, that even if the canoe fills, they jump\r\nout, empty it, and take their places again. When landed, one or two men\r\ntake up the canoe and carry it to their habitation. This, however,\r\nappeared to be provided with out-riggers, to preserve the equilibrium,\r\nand six savages, with a sort of oars, made it fly like the wind. When it\r\npassed the part of the island where we were, we hailed it as loudly as\r\nwe could; the savages answered by frightful cries, but showed no\r\nintention of approaching us or entering the bay; on the contrary, they\r\nwent on with great rapidity, continuing their cries. I followed them\r\nwith my eyes as far as I could in speechless emotion; for either my\r\nfancy deceived me, or I faintly distinguished a form of fairer\r\ncomplexion than the dark-hued beings who surrounded him—features or\r\ndress I could not see; on the whole, it was a vague impression, that I\r\ntrembled alike to believe or to doubt. Ernest, more active than I, had\r\nclimbed a sand-bank, and, with his telescope, had commanded a better\r\nview of the canoe. He watched it round a point of land, and then came\r\ndown almost as much agitated as myself. I ran to him and said—\r\n\r\n“Ernest, was it your mother?”\r\n\r\n“No, papa; I am certain it was not my mother,” said he. “Neither was it\r\nFrancis.”\r\n\r\nHere he was silent: a cold shuddering came over me.\r\n\r\n“Why are you silent?” said I; “what do you think?”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, papa, I could distinguish nothing,” said he, “even with the\r\ntelescope, they passed so quickly. Would that it were my mother and\r\nbrother, we should then be sure they were living, and might follow them.\r\nBut a thought strikes me: let us free the pinnace, and sail after the\r\ncanoe. We can go quicker than they with the sail; we shall overtake them\r\nbehind the cape, and then we shall at least be satisfied.”\r\n\r\nI hesitated, lest my sons should come back; but Ernest represented to me\r\nthat we were only fulfilling the wishes of Fritz; besides, we should\r\nreturn in a short time; he added, that he would soon disencumber\r\nthe pinnace.\r\n\r\n“Soon,” cried I, “when we have been at least two hours in covering it.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said he; “but we had a dozen journeys to make to the trees then;\r\nI will have it ready in less than half an hour.”\r\n\r\nI assisted him as actively as I could, though not with good heart, for I\r\nwas uneasy about abandoning my sons. I would have given worlds to see\r\nthem arrive before our departure; to have their assistance, which was of\r\nmuch consequence in the pinnace, and to know they were safe. I often\r\nleft off my work to take a glance into the interior of the island,\r\nhoping to see them. Frequently I mistook the trees in the twilight,\r\nwhich was now coming on, for moving objects. At last, I was not\r\ndeceived, I saw distinctly a figure walking rapidly.\r\n\r\n“They are here!” I cried, running forward, followed by Ernest; and we\r\nsoon saw a dark-coloured figure approaching. I concluded it was a\r\nsavage, and, though disappointed, was not alarmed, as he was alone. I\r\nstopped, and begged Ernest to recollect all the words he had met with in\r\nhis books, of the language of the savages. The black man approached; and\r\nconceive my surprise when I heard him cry, in my own language—\r\n\r\n“Don’t be alarmed, father, it is I, your son Fritz.”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible,” said I; “can I believe it? and Jack? What have you\r\ndone with my Jack? Where is he? Speak....”\r\n\r\nErnest did not ask. Alas! he knew too well; he had seen with his\r\ntelescope that it was his dear brother Jack that was in the canoe with\r\nthe savages; but he had not dared to tell me. I was in agony. Fritz,\r\nharassed with fatigue, and overwhelmed with grief, sunk down on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n“Oh father!” said he, sobbing, “I dread to appear before you without my\r\nbrother! I have lost him. Can you ever forgive your unfortunate Fritz?”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, yes; we are all equally unfortunate,” cried I, sinking down\r\nbeside my son, while Ernest seated himself on the other side to support\r\nme. I then besought Fritz to tell me if the savages had murdered my dear\r\nboy. He assured me that he was not killed, but carried off by the\r\nsavages; still he hoped he was safe. Ernest then told me he had seen him\r\nseated in the canoe, apparently without clothes, but not stained black\r\nas Fritz was.\r\n\r\n“I earnestly wish he had been,” said Fritz; to that I attribute my\r\nescape. But I am truly thankful to God that you have seen him, Ernest.\r\n“Which way have the monsters gone?”\r\n\r\nErnest pointed out the cape, and Fritz was anxious that we should embark\r\nwithout delay, and endeavour to snatch him from them.\r\n\r\n“And have you learned nothing of your mother and Francis?” said I.\r\n\r\n“Alas! nothing,” said he; “though I think I recognized a handkerchief,\r\nbelonging to dear mamma, on the head of a savage. I will tell you all my\r\nadventure as we go. You forgive me, dear father?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my dear son,” said I; “I forgive and pity you; but are you sure my\r\nwife and Francis are not on the island?”\r\n\r\n“Quite sure,” said he. “In fact the island is entirely uninhabited;\r\nthere is no fresh water, nor game, and no quadrupeds whatever, but rats\r\nand kangaroos; but plenty of fruit. I have filled my bag with\r\nbread-fuit, which is all we shall need: let us go.”\r\n\r\nWe worked so hard, that in a quarter of an hour the branches were\r\nremoved, and the pinnace ready to receive us. The wind was favourable\r\nfor carrying us towards the cape the savages had turned; we hoisted our\r\nsail, I took my place at the helm; the sea was calm, and the moon\r\nlighted our way. After recommending ourselves to the protection of God,\r\nI desired Fritz to commence his melancholy recital.\r\n\r\n“It will be melancholy, indeed,” said the poor boy, weeping; “if we do\r\nnot find my dear Jack, I shall never forgive myself for not having\r\nstained his skin before my own; then he should have been with you now—”\r\n\r\n“But I have you, my dear son, to console your father,” said I. “I can do\r\nnothing myself, in my sorrow. I depend on you, my two eldest, to restore\r\nto me what I have lost. Go on, Fritz.”\r\n\r\n“We went on,” continued he, “with courage and hope; and as we proceeded,\r\nwe felt that you were right in saying we ought not to judge of the\r\nisland by the borders. You can form no idea of the fertility of the\r\nisland, or of the beauty of the trees and shrubs we met with at every\r\nstep, quite unknown to me; some were covered with fragrant flowers,\r\nothers with tempting fruits; which, however, we did not venture to\r\ntaste, as we had not Knips to try them.”\r\n\r\n“Did you see any monkeys?” asked Ernest.\r\n\r\n“Not one,” replied his brother, “to the great vexation of Jack; but we\r\nsaw parrots, and all sorts of birds of the most splendid plumage. Whilst\r\nwe were remarking these creatures, I did not neglect to look carefully\r\nabout for any trace that might aid our search. I saw no hut, no sort of\r\ndwelling, nor anything that could indicate that the island was\r\ninhabited, and not the slightest appearance of fresh water; and we\r\nshould have been tormented with thirst if we had not found some\r\ncocoa-nuts containing milk, and an acid fruit, full of juice, which we\r\nhave in our own island—Ernest calls it the _carambolier_; we quenched\r\nour thirst with this, as well as with the plant, which we also have, and\r\nwhich contains water in the stem. The country is flat and open, and its\r\nbeautiful trees stand at such a distance from each other, that no one\r\ncould hide amongst them. But if we found no dwellings, we often\r\ndiscovered traces of the savages,—extinguished fires, remains of\r\nkangaroos and of fish, cocoa-nut shells, and even entire nuts, which we\r\nsecured for ourselves; we remarked, also, footmarks on the sand. We both\r\nwished anxiously to meet with a savage, that we might endeavour to make\r\nhim comprehend, by signs, whom we were in search of, hoping that natural\r\naffection might have some influence even with these untaught creatures.\r\nI was only fearful that my dress and the colour of my skin might terrify\r\nthem. In the mean time, Jack, with his usual rashness, had climbed to\r\nthe summit of one of the tallest trees, and suddenly cried out, ‘Fritz,\r\nprepare your signs, the savages are landing. Oh! what black ugly\r\ncreatures they are, and nearly naked! you ought to dress yourself like\r\nthem, to make friends with them. You can stain your skin with these,’\r\nthrowing me down branches of a sort of fruit of a dark purple colour,\r\nlarge as a plum, with a skin like the mulberry. ‘I have been tasting\r\nthem, they are very nauseous, and they have stained my fingers black;\r\nrub yourself well with the juice of this fruit, and you will be a\r\nperfect savage,’\r\n\r\n“I agreed immediately. He descended from the tree while I undressed, and\r\nwith his assistance I stained myself from head to foot, as you see me;\r\nbut don’t be alarmed, a single dip in the sea will make me a European\r\nagain. The good-natured Jack then helped to dress me in a sort of tunic\r\nmade of large leaves, and laughed heartily when he looked at me, calling\r\nme _Omnibou_, of whom he had seen a picture, which he declared I exactly\r\nresembled. I then wished to disguise him in the same way, but he would\r\nnot consent; he declared that, when he met with mamma and Francis, he\r\nshould fly to embrace them, and that he should alarm and disgust them in\r\nsuch a costume. He said I could protect him if the savages wished to\r\ndevour him: they were now at hand, and we went forward, Jack following\r\nme with my bundle of clothes under his arm. I had slung my kangaroo-skin\r\nbag of powder and provision on my shoulders, and I was glad to see that\r\nmost of the savages wore the skin of that animal, for the most part\r\nspread out like a mantle over their shoulders; few of them had other\r\nclothes, excepting one, who appeared to be the chief, and had a tunic of\r\ngreen rushes, neatly woven. I tried to recollect all the words of savage\r\nlanguage I could, but very few occurred to me. I said at first ‘_tayo,\r\ntayo_’. I don’t know whether they comprehended me, but they paid me\r\ngreat attention, evidently taking me for a savage; only one of them\r\nwished to seize my gun; but I held it firmly, and on the chief speaking\r\na word to him, he drew back. They spoke very rapidly, and I saw by their\r\nlooks they spoke about us; they looked incessantly at Jack, repeating,\r\n‘_To maiti tata_.’ Jack imitated all their motions, and made some\r\ngrimaces which seemed to amuse them. I tried in vain to attract their\r\nattention. I had observed a handkerchief twisted round the head of him\r\nwho seemed the chief, that reminded me much of the one my mother usually\r\nwore. I approached him, touched the handkerchief, saying expressively,\r\n‘_Metoua aîné mère, et tata frère_;’ I added, pointing to the sea, ‘_pay\r\ncanot_.’ But, alas! they did not appear to understand my words. The\r\nchief thought I wished to rob him of his handkerchief, and repelled me\r\nroughly. I then wished to retire, and I told Jack to follow me; but four\r\nislanders seized him, opened his waistcoat and shirt, and cried out\r\ntogether, ‘_Alea téa tata_.’ In an instant he was stripped, and his\r\nclothes and mine were put on in a strange fashion by the savages. Jack,\r\nmimicking all their contortions, recovered his shirt from one of them,\r\nput it on, and began to dance, calling on me to do the same, and, in a\r\ntone as if singing, repeated, ‘Make your escape, Fritz, while I am\r\namusing them; I will then run off and join you very soon,’ As if I could\r\nfor a moment think of leaving him in the hands of these barbarians!\r\nHowever, I recollected at that moment the bag you had given me of toys\r\nand trinkets; we had thoughtlessly left it under the great tree where I\r\nhad undressed. I told Jack, in the same tone, I would fetch it, if he\r\ncould amuse the savages till I returned, which he might be certain would\r\nbe very soon. I ran off with all speed, and without opposition arrived\r\nat the tree, found my bag well guarded, indeed, father; for what was my\r\nsurprise to find our two faithful dogs, Turk and Flora, sitting\r\nover it.”\r\n\r\n“Flora!” cried I, “she accompanied my dear wife and child into their\r\ncaptivity; they must be in this island—why have we left it!”\r\n\r\n“My dear father,” continued Fritz, “depend on it, they are not there;\r\nbut I feel convinced that the wretches who have carried off Jack, hold\r\ndear mamma and Francis in captivity; therefore we must, at all events,\r\npursue them. The meeting between Flora and me was truly joyful, for I\r\nwas now convinced that my mother and Francis were not far off, though\r\ncertainly not on the same island, or their attached friend would not\r\nhave quitted them. I concluded that the chief who had taken my mamma’s\r\nhandkerchief had also taken her dog, and brought her on this excursion,\r\nand that she had here met with her friend Turk, who had rambled from us.\r\n\r\n“After caressing Flora, and taking up my bag, I ran off full speed to\r\nthe spot where my dear Jack was trying to divert the barbarians. As I\r\napproached, I heard cries,—not the noisy laughter of the savages, but\r\ncries of distress from my beloved brother,—cries for help, addressed to\r\nme. I did not walk—I flew till I reached the spot, and I then saw him\r\nbound with a sort of strong cord, made of gut; his hands were fastened\r\nbehind his back, his legs tied together, and these cruel men were\r\ncarrying him towards their canoe, while he was crying out, ‘Fritz,\r\nFritz, where are you?’ I threw myself desperately on the six men who\r\nwere bearing him off. In the struggle, my gun, which I held in my hand,\r\ncaught something, and accidentally went off, and—O, father, it was my\r\nown dear Jack that I wounded! I cannot tell how I survived his cry of\r\n‘You have killed me!’ And when I saw his blood flow, my senses forsook\r\nme, and I fainted. When I recovered, I was alone; they had carried him\r\noff. I rose, and following the traces of his blood, arrived fortunately\r\nat the shore just as they were embarking. God permitted me to see him\r\nagain, supported by one of the savages, and even to hear his feeble\r\nvoice cry, ‘Console yourself, Fritz, I am not dead; I am only wounded in\r\nthe shoulder; it is not your fault; go, my kind brother, as quick as\r\npossible to papa, and you will both’—the canoe sailed away so swiftly,\r\nthat I heard no more; but I understood the rest—‘_you will both come\r\nand rescue me_.’ But will there be time? Will they dress his wound? Oh!\r\nfather, what have I done! Can you forgive me?”\r\n\r\nOverwhelmed with grief, I could only hold out my hand to my poor boy,\r\nand assure him I could not possibly blame him for this distressing\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nErnest, though greatly afflicted, endeavoured to console his brother; he\r\ntold him a wound in the shoulder was not dangerous, and the savages\r\ncertainly intended to dress his wound, or they would have left him to\r\ndie. Fritz, somewhat comforted, begged me to allow him to bathe, to\r\ndivest himself of the colouring, which was now become odious to him, as\r\nbeing that of these ruthless barbarians. I was reluctant to consent; I\r\nthought it might still be useful, in gaining access to the savages; but\r\nhe was certain they would recognize him in that disguise as the bearer\r\nof _the thunder_, and would distrust him. I now recollected to ask what\r\nhad become of his gun, and was sorry to learn that they had carried it\r\noff whilst he lay insensible; he himself considered that it would be\r\nuseless to them, as they had fortunately left him the bag of ammunition.\r\nErnest, however, regretted the loss to ourselves, this being the third\r\nwe had lost—the one we had left in the canoe being also in the\r\npossession of the savages. The dogs we missed, too, and Fritz could give\r\nno account of them; we concluded they had either followed the savages,\r\nor were still in the island. This was another severe sorrow; it seemed\r\nas if every sort of misfortune was poured out upon us. I rested on the\r\nshoulder of Ernest in my anguish. Fritz took advantage of my silence,\r\nand leaped out of the pinnace to have a bath. I was alarmed at first;\r\nbut he was such an excellent swimmer, and the sea was so calm, that I\r\nsoon abandoned my fears for him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\n\r\nFritz was now swimming far before us, and appeared to have no idea of\r\nturning, so that I was at once certain he projected swimming on to the\r\npoint where we had lost sight of the savages, to be the first to\r\ndiscover and aid his brother. Although he was an excellent swimmer, yet\r\nthe distance was so great, that I was much alarmed; and especially for\r\nhis arrival by night in the midst of the savages. This fear was much\r\nincreased by a very extraordinary sound, which we now heard gradually\r\napproaching us; it was a sort of submarine tempest. The weather was\r\nbeautiful; there was no wind, the moon shone in a cloudless sky, yet the\r\nwaves were swollen as if by a storm, and threatened to swallow us; we\r\nheard at the same time a noise like violent rain. Terrified at these\r\nphenomena, I cried out aloud for Fritz to return; and though it was\r\nalmost impossible my voice could reach him, we saw him swimming towards\r\nus with all his strength. Ernest and I used all our power in rowing to\r\nmeet him, so that we soon got to him. The moment he leaped in, he\r\nuttered in a stifled voice, pointing to the mountains of waves, “They\r\nare enormous marine monsters! whales, I believe! such an immense shoal!\r\nThey will swallow us up!”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Ernest, quietly; “don’t be alarmed; the whale is a gentle and\r\nharmless animal, when not attacked. I am very glad to see them so near.\r\nWe shall pass as quietly through the midst of these colossal creatures,\r\nas we did through the shining zoophytes: doubtless the whales are\r\nsearching for them, for they constitute a principal article of\r\ntheir food.”\r\n\r\nThey were now very near us, sporting on the surface of the water, or\r\nplunging into its abysses, and forcing out columns of water through\r\ntheir nostrils to a great height, which occasionally fell on us, and\r\nwetted us. Sometimes they raised themselves on their huge tail, and\r\nlooked like giants ready to fall on us and crush us; then they went down\r\nagain into the water, which foamed under their immense weight. Then they\r\nseemed to be going through some military evolutions, advancing in a\r\nsingle line, like a body of regular troops, one after another swimming\r\nwith grave dignity; still more frequently they were in lines of two and\r\ntwo. This wonderful sight partly diverted us from our own melancholy\r\nthoughts. Fritz had, however, seized his oar, without giving himself\r\ntime to dress, whilst I, at the rudder, steered as well as I could\r\nthrough these monsters, who are, notwithstanding their appearance, the\r\nmildest animals that exist. They allowed us to pass so closely, that we\r\nwere wetted with the water they spouted up, and might have touched them;\r\nand with the power to overturn us with a stroke of their tail, they\r\nnever noticed us; they seemed to be satisfied with each other’s society.\r\nWe were truly sorry to see their mortal enemy appear amongst them, the\r\nsword-fish of the south, armed with its long saw, remarkable for a sort\r\nof _fringe_ of nine or ten inches long, which distinguishes it from the\r\nsword-fish of the north. They are both terrible enemies to the whale,\r\nand next to man, who wages an eternal war with them, its most formidable\r\nfoes. The whales in our South Seas had only the sword-fish to dread; as\r\nsoon as they saw him approach, they dispersed, or dived into the depths\r\nof the ocean. One only, very near us, did not succeed in escaping, and\r\nwe witnessed a combat, of which, however, we could not see the event.\r\nThese two monsters attacked each other with equal ferocity; but as they\r\ntook an opposite direction to that we were going, we soon lost sight of\r\nthem, but we shall never forget our meeting with these wonderful giants\r\nof the deep.\r\n\r\nWe happily doubled the promontory behind which the canoe had passed, and\r\nfound ourselves in an extensive gulf, which narrowed as it entered the\r\nland, and resembled the mouth of a river. We did not hesitate to follow\r\nits course. We went round the bay, but found no traces of man, but\r\nnumerous herds of the amphibious animal, called sometimes the sea-lion,\r\nthe sea-dog, or the sea-elephant, or trunked phoca: modern voyagers give\r\nit the last name. These animals, though of enormous size, are gentle and\r\npeaceful, unless roused by the cruelty of man. They were in such numbers\r\non this desert coast, that they would have prevented our approach if we\r\nhad intended it. They actually covered the beach and the rocks, opening\r\ntheir huge mouths, armed with very sharp teeth, more frightful than\r\ndangerous. As it was night when we entered the bay, they were all\r\nsleeping, but they produced a most deafening noise with their breathing.\r\nWe left them to their noisy slumber; for us, alas! no such comfort\r\nremained. The continual anxiety attending an affliction like ours\r\ndestroys all repose, and for three days we had not slept an hour. Since\r\nthe new misfortune of Jack’s captivity, we were all kept up by a kind of\r\nfever. Fritz was in a most incredible state of excitement, and declared\r\nhe would never sleep till he had rescued his beloved brother. His bath\r\nhad partially removed the colouring from his skin, but he was still dark\r\nenough to pass for a savage, when arrayed like them. The shores of the\r\nstrait we were navigating were very steep, and we had yet not met with\r\nany place where we could land; however, my sons persisted in thinking\r\nthe savages could have taken no other route, as they had lost sight of\r\ntheir canoe round the promontory. As the strait was narrow and shallow,\r\nI consented that Fritz should throw off the clothes he had on, and swim\r\nto reconnoitre a place which seemed to be an opening in the rocks or\r\nhills that obstructed our passage, and we soon had the pleasure of\r\nseeing him standing on the shore, motioning for us to approach. The\r\nstrait was now so confined, that we could not have proceeded any further\r\nwith the pinnace; we could not even bring it to the shore. Ernest and I\r\nwere obliged to step into the water up to the waist; but we took the\r\nprecaution to tie a long and strong rope to the prow, and when we were\r\naided by the vigorous arm of Fritz, we soon drew the pinnace near enough\r\nto fix it by means of the anchor.\r\n\r\nThere were neither trees nor rocks on that desert shore to which we\r\ncould fasten the pinnace; but, to our great delight and encouragement,\r\nwe found, at a short distance from our landing-place, a bark canoe,\r\nwhich my sons were certain was that in which Jack had been carried off.\r\nWe entered it, but at first saw only the oars; at last, however, Ernest\r\ndiscovered, in the water which half filled the canoe, part of a\r\nhandkerchief, stained with blood, which they recognized as belonging to\r\nJack. This discovery, which relieved our doubts, caused Fritz to shed\r\ntears of joy. We were certainly on the track of the robbers, and might\r\ntrust that they had not proceeded farther with their barbarity. We found\r\non the sand, and in the boat, some cocoa-nut shells and fish-bones,\r\nwhich satisfied us of the nature of their repasts. We resolved to\r\ncontinue our search into the interior of the country, following the\r\ntraces of the steps of the savages. We could not find any traces of\r\nJack’s foot, which would have alarmed us, if Fritz had not suggested\r\nthat they had carried him, on account of his wound. We were about to set\r\nout, when the thoughts of the pinnace came over us; it was more than\r\never necessary for us to preserve this, our only means of return, and\r\nwhich moreover contained our goods for ransom, our ammunition, and our\r\nprovisions, still untouched, for some bread-fruit Fritz had gathered,\r\nsome mussles, and small, but excellent, oysters, had been sufficient for\r\nus. It was fortunate that we had brought some gourds of water with us,\r\nfor we had not met with any. We decided that it would be necessary to\r\nleave one of our party to guard the precious pinnace, though this would\r\nbe but an insufficient and dangerous defence, in case of the approach of\r\nthe natives. My recent bereavements made me tremble at the idea of\r\nleaving either of my sons. I cannot yet reflect on the agony of that\r\nmoment without horror—yet it was the sole means to secure our vessel;\r\nthere was not a creek or a tree to hide it, and the situation of the\r\ncanoe made it certain the savages must return there to embark. My\r\nchildren knew my thoughts, by the distracted glances with which I\r\nalternately regarded them and the pinnace, and, after consulting each\r\nother’s looks, Ernest said—\r\n\r\n“The pinnace must not remain here unguarded, father, to be taken, or, at\r\nany rate, pillaged by the natives, who will return for their canoe.\r\nEither we must all wait till they come, or you must leave me to defend\r\nit. I see, Fritz, that you could not endure to remain here.”\r\n\r\nIn fact, Fritz impatiently stamped with his foot, saying—\r\n\r\n“I confess, I cannot remain here; Jack may be dying of his wound, and\r\nevery moment is precious. I will seek him—find him—and save him! I\r\nhave a presentiment I shall; and if I discover him, as I expect, in the\r\nhands of the savages, I know the way to release him, and to prevent\r\nthem carrying off our pinnace.”\r\n\r\nI saw that the daring youth, in the heat of his exasperation, exposed\r\nalone to the horde of barbarians, might also become their victim. I saw\r\nthat my presence was necessary to restrain and aid him; and I decided,\r\nwith a heavy heart, to leave Ernest alone to protect the vessel. His\r\ncalm and cool manner made it less dangerous for him to meet the natives.\r\nHe knew several words of their language, and had read of the mode of\r\naddressing and conciliating them. He promised me to be prudent, which\r\nhis elder brother could not be. We took the bag of toys which Fritz had\r\nbrought, and left those in the chest, to use if necessary; and, praying\r\nfor the blessing of Heaven on my son, we left him. My sorrow was great;\r\nbut he was no longer a child, and his character encouraged me. Fritz\r\nembraced his brother, and promised him to bring Jack back in safety.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter having traversed for some time a desert, sandy plain without\r\nmeeting a living creature, we arrived at a thick wood, where we lost the\r\ntraces we had carefully followed. We were obliged to direct our course\r\nby chance, keeping no fixed road, but advancing as the interwoven\r\nbranches permitted us. The wood was alive with the most beautiful birds\r\nof brilliant and varied plumage; but, in our anxious and distressed\r\nstate, we should have been more interested in seeing a savage than a\r\nbird. We passed at last through these verdant groves, and reached an\r\narid plain extending to the shore. We again discovered numerous\r\nfootsteps; and, whilst we were observing them, we saw a large canoe pass\r\nrapidly, filled with islanders: and this time I thought that, in spite\r\nof the distance, I could recognize the canoe we had built, and which\r\nthey had robbed us of. Fritz wished to swim after them, and was\r\nbeginning to undress himself, and I only stopped him by declaring that\r\nif he did, I must follow him, as I had decided not to be separated from\r\nhim. I even proposed that we should return to Ernest, as I was of\r\nopinion that the savages would stop at the place where we had\r\ndisembarked, to take away the boat they had left, and we might then, by\r\nmeans of the words Ernest had acquired, learn from them what had become\r\nof my wife and children. Fritz agreed to this, though he still persisted\r\nthat the easiest and quickest mode of return would have been by\r\nswimming. We were endeavouring to retrace our road, when, to our great\r\nastonishment, we saw, at a few yards’ distance, a man clothed in a long\r\nblack robe advancing towards us, whom we immediately recognized as\r\na European.\r\n\r\n“Either I am greatly deceived,” said I, “or this is a missionary, a\r\nworthy servant of God, come into these remote regions to make Him known\r\nto the wretched idolators.”\r\n\r\nWe hastened to him. I was not wrong. He was one of those zealous and\r\ncourageous Christians who devote their energies and their lives to the\r\ninstruction and eternal salvation of men born in another hemisphere, of\r\nanother colour, uncivilized, but not less our brothers. I had quitted\r\nEurope with the same intention, but Providence had ordered it\r\notherwise; yet I met with joy one of my Christian brethren, and, unable\r\nto speak from emotion, I silently embraced him. He spoke to me in\r\nEnglish—a language I had fortunately learned myself, and taught to my\r\nchildren—and his words fell on my soul like the message of the angel to\r\nAbraham, commanding him to spare his son.\r\n\r\n“You are the person I am seeking,” said he, in a mild and tender tone,\r\n“and I thank Heaven that I have met with you. This youth is Fritz, your\r\neldest son, I conclude; but where have you left your second\r\nson, Ernest?”\r\n\r\n“Reverend man,” cried Fritz, seizing his hands, “you have seen my\r\nbrother Jack. Perhaps my mother? You know where they are. Oh! are\r\nthey living?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, they are living, and well taken care of,” said the missionary;\r\n“come, and I will lead you to them.”\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, necessary to lead me; I was so overcome with joy, that I\r\nshould have fainted, but the good missionary made me inhale some\r\nvolatile salts which he had about him; and supported by him and my son,\r\nI managed to walk. My first words were a thanksgiving to God for his\r\nmercy; then I implored my good friend to tell me if I should indeed see\r\nmy wife and children again. He assured me that an hour’s walk would\r\nbring me to them; but I suddenly recollected Ernest, and refused to\r\npresent myself before the beloved ones while he was still in danger. The\r\nmissionary smiled, as he told me he expected this delay, and wished to\r\nknow where we had left Ernest. I recounted to him our arrival in the\r\nisland, and the purpose for which we had left Ernest; with our intention\r\nof returning to him as soon as we saw the canoe pass, hoping to obtain\r\nsome intelligence from the savages.\r\n\r\n“But how could you have made yourselves understood?” said he; “are you\r\nacquainted with their language?”\r\n\r\nI told him Ernest had studied the vocabulary of the South Sea islanders.\r\n\r\n“Doubtless that of Tahiti, or the Friendly Islands,” said he; “but the\r\ndialect of these islanders differs much from theirs. I have resided here\r\nmore than a year, and have studied it, so may be of use to you; let us\r\ngo. Which way did you come?”\r\n\r\n“Through that thick wood,” replied I; “where we wandered a long time;\r\nand I fear we shall have some difficulty in finding our way back.”\r\n\r\n“You should have taken the precaution to notch the trees as you came,”\r\nsaid our worthy friend; “without that precaution, you were in danger of\r\nbeing lost; but we will find my marks, which will lead us to the brook,\r\nand following its course we shall be safe.”\r\n\r\n“We saw no brook,” remarked Fritz.\r\n\r\n“There is a brook of excellent water, which you have missed in crossing\r\nthe forest; if you had ascended the course of the stream, you would have\r\nreached the hut which contains your dear friends; the brook runs\r\nbefore it.”\r\n\r\nFritz struck his forehead with vexation.\r\n\r\n“God orders all for the best,” said I to the good priest; “we might not\r\nhave met with you; we should have been without Ernest; you might have\r\nsought us all day in vain. Ah! good man, it is under your holy auspices\r\nthat our family ought to meet, in order to increase our happiness. Now\r\nplease to tell me”—\r\n\r\n“But first,” interrupted Fritz, “pray tell me how Jack is? He was\r\nwounded, and”—\r\n\r\n“Be composed, young man,” said the calm man of God; “the wound, which he\r\nconfesses he owes to his own imprudence, will have no evil consequences;\r\nthe savages had applied some healing herbs to it, but it was necessary\r\nto extract a small ball, an operation which I performed yesterday\r\nevening. Since then he suffers less; and will be soon well, when his\r\nanxiety about you is relieved.”\r\n\r\nFritz embraced the kind missionary, entreating his pardon for his\r\nrashness, and adding, “Did my brother talk to you of us, sir?”\r\n\r\n“He did,” answered his friend; “but I was acquainted with you before;\r\nyour mother talked continually of her husband and children. What mingled\r\npain and delight she felt yesterday evening when the savages brought to\r\nher dear Jack, wounded! I was fortunately in the hut to comfort her, and\r\nassist her beloved boy.”\r\n\r\n“And dear Francis,” said I, “how rejoiced he would be to see his brother\r\nagain!”\r\n\r\n“Francis,” said the missionary, smiling, “will be the protector of you\r\nall. He is the idol of the savages now; an idolatry permitted by\r\nChristianity.”\r\n\r\nWe proceeded through the wood as we conversed, and at last reached the\r\nbrook. I had a thousand questions to ask, and was very anxious to know\r\nhow my wife and Francis had been brought to this island, and how they\r\nmet with the missionary. The five or six days we had been separated\r\nseemed to me five or six months. We walked too quickly for me to get\r\nmuch information. The English minister said little, and referred me to\r\nmy wife and son for all details. On the subject of his own noble mission\r\nhe was less reserved.\r\n\r\n“Thank God,” said he, “I have already succeeded in giving this people\r\nsome notions of humanity. They love their _black friend_, as they call\r\nme, and willingly listen to my preaching, and the singing of some hymns.\r\nWhen your little Francis was taken, he had his reed flageolet in his\r\npocket, and his playing and graceful manners have so captivated them\r\nthat I fear they will with reluctance resign him. The king is anxious to\r\nadopt him. But do not alarm yourself, brother; I hope to arrange all\r\nhappily, with the divine assistance. I have gained some power over them,\r\nand I will avail myself of it. A year ago, I could not have answered for\r\nthe life of the prisoners; now I believe them to be in safety. But how\r\nmuch is there yet to teach these simple children of nature, who listen\r\nonly to her voice, and yield to every impression! Their first impulse is\r\ngood, but they are so unsteady that affection may suddenly change to\r\nhatred; they are inclined to theft, violent in their anger, yet generous\r\nand affectionate. You will see an instance of this in the abode where a\r\nwoman, more unfortunate than your wife, since she has lost her husband,\r\nhas found an asylum.”\r\n\r\nHe was silent, and I did not question him farther on this subject. We\r\nwere approaching the arm of the sea where we had left our pinnace, and\r\nmy heart, at ease about the rest, became now anxious solely for Ernest.\r\nSometimes the hills concealed the water from us; Fritz climbed them,\r\nanxious to discover his brother, at last I heard him suddenly cry out\r\n“Ernest, Ernest....”\r\n\r\nHe was answered by shouts, or rather howls, amongst which I could not\r\ndistinguish the voice of my son. Terror seized me.\r\n\r\n“These are the islanders,” said I to the missionary; “and these\r\nfrightful cries....”\r\n\r\n“Are cries of joy,” said he, “which will be increased when they see you.\r\nThis path will conduct us to the shore. Call Fritz; but I do not see\r\nhim; he will, doubtless, have descended the hill, and joined them. Have\r\nno fears; recommend your sons to be prudent. The _black friend_ will\r\nspeak to his black friends, and they will hear him.”\r\n\r\nWe proceeded towards the shore, when, at some distance, I perceived my\r\ntwo sons on the deck of the pinnace, which was covered with the\r\nislanders, to whom they were distributing the treasures of the chest, at\r\nleast those we had put apart in the bag; they had not been so imprudent\r\nas to open the chest itself, which would soon have been emptied; it\r\nremained snugly below the deck, with the powder-barrel. At every new\r\nacquisition, the savages uttered cries of joy, repeating _mona, mona_\r\nsignifying _beautiful_. The mirrors were at first received with the most\r\ndelight, but this soon changed into terror; they evidently conceived\r\nthere was something magical about them, and flung them all into the sea.\r\nThe coloured glass beads had then the preference, but the distribution\r\ncaused many disputes. Those who had not obtained any, wished to deprive\r\nthe rest of them by force. The clamour and quarrelling were increasing,\r\nwhen the voice of the missionary was heard, and calmed them as if by\r\nenchantment. All left the pinnace, and crowded round him; he harangued\r\nthem in their own language, and pointed me out to them, naming me, _me\r\ntouatane_, that is, _father_, which they repeated in their turn. Some\r\napproached me, and rubbed their noses against mine, which, the pastor\r\nhad informed me, was a mark of respect. In the mean time, Fritz had\r\ninformed Ernest that his mother and brothers were found, and that the\r\nman who accompanied us was a European. Ernest received the intelligence\r\nwith a calm joy; it was only by the tears in his eyes you could discover\r\nhow much his heart was affected; he leaped from the pinnace and came to\r\nthank the missionary. I had my share of his gratitude too, for coming to\r\nseek him, before I had seen the dear lost ones.\r\n\r\nWe had now to think of joining them. We unanimously decided to proceed\r\nby water; in the first place, that we might bring our pinnace as near as\r\npossible to my dear Elizabeth, who was still suffering from her fall,\r\nher forced voyage, and, above all, from her anxiety; besides, I confess\r\nthat I felt a little fatigue, and should have reluctantly set out to\r\ncross the wood a third time; but, in addition to this, I was assured\r\nthat it was the promptest mode of reaching our friends, and this alone\r\nwould have decided me. The pinnace was then loosened, the sail set, and\r\nwe entered with thankfulness. Dreading the agitation of my wife if she\r\nsaw us suddenly, I entreated our new friend to precede us, and prepare\r\nher. He consented; but, as he was coming on board, he was suddenly\r\nstopped by the natives, and one of them addressed him for some time. The\r\nmissionary listened till he had concluded, with calmness and dignity;\r\nthen, turning to me, he said—\r\n\r\n“You must answer for me, brother, the request which _Parabéry_ makes: he\r\nwishes me, in the name of the whole, to wait a few moments for their\r\nchief, to whom they give the title of king. _Bara-ourou_, as he is\r\ncalled, has assembled them here for a ceremony, at which all his\r\nwarriors must assist. I have been anxious to attend, fearing it might be\r\na sacrifice to their idols, which I have always strongly opposed, and\r\nwishing to seize this occasion to declare to them the one true God.\r\nBara-ourou is not wicked, and I hope to succeed in touching his heart,\r\nenlightening his mind, and converting him to Christianity; his example\r\nwould certainly be followed by the greatest part of his subjects, who\r\nare much attached to him. Your presence, and the name of God uttered by\r\nyou, with the fervour and in the attitude of profound veneration and\r\ndevotion, may aid this work of charity and love. Have you sufficient\r\nself-command to delay, for perhaps a few hours, the meeting with your\r\nfamily? Your wife and children, not expecting you, will not suffer from\r\nsuspense. If you do not agree to this, I will conduct you to them, and\r\nreturn, I hope in time, to fulfil my duty. I wait your decision to reply\r\nto Parabéry, who is already sufficiently acquainted with the truth, to\r\ndesire that his king and his brethren should know it also.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of this true servant of God; but I cannot do justice\r\nto the expression of his heavenly countenance. Mr. Willis, for such was\r\nhis name, was forty-five or fifty years of age, tall and thin; the\r\nlabours and fatigues of his divine vocation had, more than years, left\r\ntheir traces on his noble figure and countenance; he stooped a little,\r\nhis open and elevated forehead was slightly wrinkled, and his thin hair\r\nwas prematurely grey; his clear blue eyes were full of intelligence and\r\nkindness, reading your thoughts, and showing you all his own. He usually\r\nkept his arms folded over his breast, and was very calm in speaking; but\r\nwhen his extended hand pointed to heaven, the effect was irresistible;\r\none might have thought he saw the very glory he spoke of. His simple\r\nwords to me seemed a message from God, and it would have been impossible\r\nto resist him. It was indeed a sacrifice; but I made it without\r\nhesitation. I glanced at my sons, who had their eyes cast down; but I\r\nsaw Fritz knitting his brows. “I shall stay with you, father,” said I,\r\n“happy if I can assist you in fulfilling your sacred duties.”\r\n\r\n“And you, young people,” said he, “are you of the same opinion?”\r\n\r\nFritz came forward, and frankly said, “Sir, it was, unfortunately, I who\r\nwounded my brother Jack; he has been generous enough to conceal this;\r\nyou extracted the ball which I discharged into his shoulder; I owe his\r\nlife to you, and mine is at your disposal; I can refuse you nothing;\r\nand, however impatient, I must remain with you.”\r\n\r\n“I repeat the same,” said Ernest; “you protected our mother and\r\nbrothers, and, by God’s permission, you restore them to us. We will all\r\nremain with you; you shall fix the time of our meeting, which will not,\r\nI trust, be long delayed.”\r\n\r\nI signified my approbation, and the missionary gave them his hand,\r\nassuring them that their joy on meeting their friends would be greatly\r\nincreased by the consciousness of this virtuous self-denial.\r\n\r\nWe soon experienced this. Mr. Willis learned from Parabéry, that they\r\nwere going to fetch their king in our pretty canoe when we saw it pass.\r\nThe royal habitation was situated on the other side of the promontory,\r\nand we soon heard a joyful cry, that they saw the canoe coming. While\r\nthe savages were engaged in preparing to meet their chief, I entered the\r\npinnace, and descending beneath the deck, I took from the chest what I\r\njudged most fitting to present to his majesty. I chose an axe, a saw, a\r\npretty, small, ornamented sabre, which could not do much harm, a packet\r\nof nails, and one of glass beads. I had scarcely put aside these\r\narticles, when my sons rushed to me in great excitement.\r\n\r\n“Oh! father,” cried they, at once, “look! look! summon all your\r\nfortitude; see! there is Francis himself in the canoe; oh! how curiously\r\nhe is dressed!”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Two savages took Francis on their shoulders, and two\r\nothers took the king in the same way.”]\r\n\r\nI looked, and saw, at some distance, our canoe ascending the strait; it\r\nwas decorated with green branches, which the savages, who formed the\r\nking’s guard, held in their hand; others were rowing vigorously; and the\r\nchief, wearing a red and yellow handkerchief, which had belonged to my\r\nwife, as a turban, was seated at the stern, and a pretty, little,\r\nblooming, flaxen-haired boy was placed on his right shoulder. With what\r\ndelight did I recognize my child. He was naked above the waist, and wore\r\na little tunic of woven leaves, which reached to his knees, a necklace\r\nand bracelets of shells, and a variety of coloured feathers mingled\r\nwith his bright curls; one of these fell over his face, and doubtless\r\nprevented him from seeing us. The chief seemed much engaged with him,\r\nand continually took some ornament from his own dress to decorate him.\r\n“It is my child!” said I, in great terror, to Mr. Willis, “my dearest\r\nand youngest! They have taken him from his mother. What must be her\r\ngrief! He is her Benjamin—the child of her love. Why have they taken\r\nhim? Why have they adorned him in this manner? Why have they brought\r\nhim here?”\r\n\r\n“Have no fear,” said the missionary; “they will do him no harm. I\r\npromise you they shall restore him, and you shall take him back to his\r\nmother. Place yourselves at my side, with these branches in your hands.”\r\n\r\nHe took some from Parabéry, who held a bundle of them, and gave us each\r\none; each of the savages took one also. They were from a tree which had\r\nslender, elegant leaves, and rich scarlet flowers—species of _mimosa_;\r\nthe Indians call it the tree of peace. They carry a branch of it when\r\nthey have no hostile intentions; in all their assemblies, when war is\r\nproclaimed, they make a fire of these branches, and if all are consumed,\r\nit is considered an omen of victory.\r\n\r\nWhile Mr. Willis was explaining this to us, the canoe approached. Two\r\nsavages took Francis on their shoulders, two others took the king in the\r\nsame way, and advanced gravely towards us. What difficulty I had to\r\nrestrain myself from snatching my child from his bearers, and embracing\r\nhim! My sons were equally agitated; Fritz was darting forward, but the\r\nmissionary restrained him. Francis, somewhat alarmed at his position,\r\nhad his eyes cast down, and had not yet seen us. When the king was\r\nwithin twenty yards of us, they stopped, and all the savages prostrated\r\nthemselves before him; we alone remained standing. Then Francis saw us,\r\nand uttered a piercing cry, calling out, “Papa! dear brothers!” He\r\nstruggled to quit the shoulders of his bearers, but they held him too\r\nfirmly. It was impossible to restrain ourselves longer; we all cried\r\nout, and mingled our tears and lamentations. I said to the good\r\nmissionary,—a little too harshly, perhaps,—“Ah! if you were a father!”\r\n\r\n“I am,” said he, “the father of all this flock, and your children are\r\nmine; I am answerable for all. Command your sons to be silent; request\r\nthe child to be composed, and leave the rest to me.”\r\n\r\nI immediately took advantage of the permission to speak. “Dear Francis,”\r\nsaid I, holding out my arms, “we are come to seek you and your mother;\r\nafter all our dangers, we shall soon meet again, to part no more. But be\r\ncomposed, my child, and do not risk the happiness of that moment by any\r\nimpatience. Trust in God, and in this good friend that He has given us,\r\nand who has restored to me the treasures without which I could not\r\nlive.” We then waved our hands to him, and he remained still, but wept\r\nquietly, murmuring our names: “Papa, Fritz, Ernest,—tell me about\r\nmamma,” said he, at last, in an inquiring tone.\r\n\r\n“She does not know we are so near her,” said I. “How did you leave her?”\r\n\r\n“Very much grieved,” said he, “that they brought me away; but they have\r\nnot done me any harm,—they are so kind; and we shall soon all go back\r\nto her. Oh! what joy for her and our friends!”\r\n\r\n“One word about Jack,” said Fritz; “how does his wound go on?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, pretty well,” answered he; “he has no pain now, and Sophia nurses\r\nhim and amuses him. How little Matilda would weep when the savages\r\ncarried me off! If you knew, papa, how kind and good she is!”\r\n\r\nI had no time to ask who Sophia and Matilda were. They had allowed me to\r\nspeak to my son to tranquillize him, but the king now commanded silence,\r\nand, still elevated on the shoulders of his people, began to harangue\r\nthe assembly. He was a middle-aged man, with striking features; his\r\nthick lips, his hair tinged with red paint, his dark brown face, which,\r\nas well as his body, was tattooed with white, gave him a formidable\r\naspect; yet his countenance was not unpleasant, and announced no\r\nferocity. In general, these savages have enormous mouths, with long\r\nwhite teeth; they wear a tunic of reeds or leaves from the waist to the\r\nknees. My wife’s handkerchief, which I had recognized at first, was\r\ngracefully twisted round the head of the king; his hair was fastened up\r\nhigh, and ornamented with feathers, but he had nearly removed them all\r\nto deck my boy. He placed him at his side, and frequently pointed him\r\nout during his speech. I was on thorns. As soon as he had concluded, the\r\nsavages shouted, clapped their hands, and surrounded my child, dancing,\r\nand presenting him fruit, flowers, and shells, crying out, _Ouraki_! a\r\ncry in which the king, who was now standing, joined also.\r\n\r\n“What does the word _Ouraki_ mean?” said I to the missionary.\r\n\r\n“It is the new name of your son,” answered he; “or rather of the son of\r\n_Bara-ourou_, who has just adopted him.”\r\n\r\n“Never!” cried I, darting forward. “Boys, let us rescue your brother\r\nfrom these barbarians!” We all three rushed towards Francis, who,\r\nweeping, extended his arms to us. The savages attempted to repulse us;\r\nbut at that moment the missionary pronounced some words in a loud voice;\r\nthey immediately prostrated themselves on their faces, and we had no\r\ndifficulty in securing the child. We brought him to our protector, who\r\nstill remained in the same attitude in which he had spoken, with his\r\neyes and his right hand raised towards heaven. He made a sign for the\r\nsavages to rise, and afterwards spoke for some time to them. What would\r\nI have given to have understood him! But I formed some idea from the\r\neffect of his words. He frequently pointed to us, pronouncing the word\r\n_éroué_, and particularly addressed the king, who listened motionless to\r\nhim. At the conclusion of his speech, Bara-ourou approached, and\r\nattempted to take hold of Francis, who threw himself into my arms, where\r\nI firmly held him.\r\n\r\n“Let him now go,” said Mr. Willis, “and fear nothing.”\r\n\r\nI released the child; the king lifted him up, pressed his own nose to\r\nhis; then, placing him on the ground, took away the feathers and\r\nnecklace with which he had decked him, and replaced him in my arms,\r\nrubbing my nose also, and repeating several words. In my first emotion,\r\nI threw myself on my knees, and was imitated by my two sons.\r\n\r\n“It is well!” cried the missionary, again raising his eyes and hands.\r\n“Thus should you offer thanks to heaven. The king, convinced it is the\r\nwill of God, restores your child, and wishes to become your friend: he\r\nis worthy to be so, for he adores and fears your God. May he soon learn\r\nto know and believe all the truths of Christianity! Let us pray together\r\nthat the time may come when, on these shores, where paternal love has\r\ntriumphed, I may see a temple rise to the Father of all,—the God of\r\npeace and love.”\r\n\r\nHe kneeled down, and the king and all his people followed his example.\r\nWithout understanding the words of his prayer, I joined in the spirit of\r\nit with all my heart and soul.\r\n\r\nI then presented my offerings to the king, increasing them considerably.\r\nI would willingly have given all my treasures in exchange for him he had\r\nrestored to me. My sons also gave something to each of the savages, who\r\nincessantly cried _tayo, tayo_. I begged Mr. Willis to tell the king I\r\ngave him my canoe, and hoped he would use it to visit us in our island,\r\nto which we were returning. He appeared pleased, and wished to accompany\r\nus in our pinnace, which he seemed greatly to admire; some of his people\r\nfollowed him on board to row, the rest placed themselves in the canoes.\r\nWe soon entered the sea again, and, doubling the second point, we came\r\nto an arm of the sea much wider, and deep enough for our pinnace, and\r\nwhich conducted us to the object of our dearest hopes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were never weary with caressing our dear Francis. We were very\r\nanxious to learn from him all the particulars of the arrival of the\r\nsavages in our island, the seizure of his mother and himself, their\r\nvoyage, and their residence here, and who were the friends they had met\r\nwith: but it was impossible, his tawny majesty never left us for a\r\nmoment, and played with the boy as if he had been a child himself.\r\nFrancis showed him all the toys from our chest; he was extremely amused\r\nwith the small mirrors, and the dolls. A painted carriage, driven by a\r\ncoachman who raised his whip when the wheels turned, appeared miraculous\r\nto him. He uttered screams of delight as he pointed it out to his\r\nfollowers. The ticking of my watch also charmed him; and as I had\r\nseveral more, I gave him it, showing him how to wind it up. But the\r\nfirst time he tried to do it, he broke the spring, and when it was\r\nsilent he cared no longer for it, but threw it on one side. However, as\r\nthe gold was very glittering, he took it up again, and suspending it\r\nfrom the handkerchief that was wound round his head, it hung over his\r\nnose, and formed a striking ornament. Francis showed him his face in a\r\nmirror, which royal amusement made him laugh heartily. He asked the\r\nmissionary if it was the invisible and Almighty God who had made all\r\nthese wonderful things. Mr. Willis replied, that it was he who gave men\r\nthe power to make them. I do not know whether Bara-ourou comprehended\r\nthis, but he remained for some time in deep thought. I profited by this\r\nto ask the missionary what were the words which had terrified them so\r\nwhen they wished to keep my son from me, and which had compelled them to\r\nsurrender him?\r\n\r\n“I told them,” answered he, “that the Almighty and unseen God, of whom I\r\nspoke to them daily, ordered them, by my voice, to restore a son to his\r\nfather; I threatened them with his anger if they refused, and promised\r\nthem his mercy if they obeyed; and they did obey. The first step is\r\ngained, they know the duty of adoring and obeying God; every other truth\r\nproceeds from this, and I have no doubt that my savages will one day\r\nbecome good Christians. My method of instruction is suited to their\r\nlimited capacity. I prove to them that their wooden idols, made by their\r\nown hands, could neither create, hear them, nor protect them. I have\r\nshown them God in his works, have declared him to be as good as he is\r\npowerful, hating evil, cruelty, murder, and cannibalism, and they have\r\nrenounced all these. In their late wars they have either released or\r\nadopted their prisoners. If they carried off your wife and son, they\r\nintended it for a good action, as you will soon understand.”\r\n\r\nI could not ask Francis any questions, as Bara-ourou continued playing\r\nwith him, so turning to Ernest, I asked him what passed when the savages\r\njoined him?\r\n\r\n“When you left me,” said he, “I amused myself by searching for shells,\r\nplants, and zoophytes, with which the rocks abound, and I have added a\r\ngood deal to my collection. I was at some distance from the pinnace,\r\nwhen I heard a confused sound of voices, and concluded that the savages\r\nwere coming; in fact, ten or a dozen issued from the road you had\r\nentered, and I cannot comprehend how you missed meeting them. Fearing\r\nthey would attempt to take possession of my pinnace, I returned\r\nspeedily, and seized a loaded musket, though I determined to use it only\r\nto defend my own life, or the pinnace. I stood on the deck in an\r\nattitude as bold and imposing as I could command; but I did not succeed\r\nin intimidating them. They leaped, one after the other, on deck, and\r\nsurrounded me, uttering loud cries. I could not discover whether they\r\nwere cries of joy or of fury; but I showed no fear, and addressed them\r\nin a friendly tone, in some words from Capt. Cook’s vocabulary; but they\r\ndid not seem to comprehend me, neither could I understand any of theirs\r\nexcept _écroué_ (father), which they frequently repeated, and\r\n_tara-tauo_ (woman). One of them had Fritz’s gun, from which I concluded\r\nthey were of the party that had carried off Jack. I took it, and showing\r\nhim mine, endeavoured to make him understand that it also belonged to\r\nme. He thought I wished to exchange, and readily offered to return it,\r\nand take mine. This would not have suited me; Fritz’s gun was\r\ndischarged, and I could not let them have mine loaded. To prevent\r\naccident, surrounded as I was, I decided to give them a fright, and\r\nseeing a bird flying above us, I took aim so correctly, that my shot\r\nbrought down the bird, a blue pigeon. They were for a moment stupified\r\nwith terror; then immediately all left the pinnace, except Parabéry; he\r\nseemed to be pleased with me, often pointing to the sky, saying _mété_,\r\nwhich means _good_, I believe. His comrades were examining the dead\r\nbird. Some touched their own shoulders, to try if they were wounded as\r\nwell as the bird and Jack had been, which convinced me they had carried\r\nhim off. I tried to make Parabéry understand my suspicion, and I think I\r\nsucceeded, for he made me an affirmative sign, pointing to the interior\r\nof the island, and touching his shoulder with an air of pity. I took\r\nseveral things from the chest, and gave them to him, making signs that\r\nhe should show them to the others, and induce them to return to me. He\r\ncomprehended me very well, and complied with my wishes. I was soon\r\nsurrounded by the whole party, begging of me. I was busy distributing\r\nbeads, mirrors, and small knives when you came, and we are now excellent\r\nfriends. Two or three of them returned to the wood, and brought me\r\ncocoa-nuts and bananas. But we must be careful to hide our guns, of\r\nwhich they have a holy horror. And now, dear father, I think we ought\r\nnot to call these people _savages_. They have the simplicity of\r\nchildhood; a trifle irritates them, a trifle appeases them; they are\r\ngrateful and affectionate. I find them neither cruel nor barbarous. They\r\nhave done me no harm, when they might easily have killed me, thrown me\r\ninto the sea, or carried me away.”\r\n\r\n“We must not,” said I, “judge of all savage people by these, who have\r\nhad the benefit of a virtuous teacher. Mr. Willis has already cast into\r\ntheir hearts the seeds of that divine religion, which commands us to do\r\nunto others as we would they should do unto us, and to pardon and love\r\nour enemies.”\r\n\r\nWhile we were discoursing, we arrived at a spot where the canoes had\r\nalready landed; we were about to do the same, but the king did not seem\r\ninclined to quit the pinnace, but continued speaking to the missionary.\r\nI was still fearful that he wished to keep Francis, to whom he seemed to\r\nbe more and more attached, holding him constantly on his knee; but at\r\nlast, to my great joy, he placed him in my arms.\r\n\r\n“He keeps his word with you,” said Mr. Willis. “You may carry him to his\r\nmother; but, in return, he wishes you to permit him to go in your\r\npinnace to his abode on the other side of the strait, that he may show\r\nit to the women, and he promises to bring it back; perhaps there would\r\nbe danger in refusing him.”\r\n\r\nI agreed with him; but still there was a difficulty in granting this\r\nrequest. If he chose to keep it, how should we return? Besides, it\r\ncontained our only barrel of powder, and all our articles of traffic,\r\nand how could we expect it would escape pillage?\r\n\r\nMr. Willis confessed he had not yet been able to cure their fondness for\r\ntheft, and suggested, as the only means of security, that I should\r\naccompany the king, and bring the pinnace back, which was then to be\r\ncommitted to the charge of Parabéry, for whose honesty he would be\r\nresponsible.\r\n\r\nHere was another delay; the day was so far advanced, that I might not,\r\nperhaps, be able to return before night. Besides, though my wife did\r\nnot know we were so near her, she knew they had carried away Francis,\r\nand she would certainly be very uneasy about him. Bara-ourou looked very\r\nimpatient, and as it was necessary to answer him, I decided at once; I\r\nresigned Francis to the missionary, entreating him to take him to his\r\nmother, to prepare her for our approach, and to relate the cause of our\r\ndelay. I told my sons, it was my desire they should accompany me. Fritz\r\nagreed rather indignantly, and Ernest with calmness. Mr. Willis told the\r\nking, that in gratitude to him, and to do him honour, I and my sons\r\nwished to accompany him. He appeared much flattered at this, made my\r\nsons seat themselves on each side of him, endeavoured to pronounce their\r\nnames, and finished by exchanging names as a token of friendship,\r\ncalling Fritz, _Bara_; Ernest, _Ourou_; and himself, Fritz-Ernest. Mr.\r\nWillis and Francis left us; our hearts were sad to see them go where all\r\nour wishes centred; but the die was cast. The king gave the signal to\r\ndepart; the canoes took the lead, and we followed. In an hour we saw the\r\nroyal palace. It was a tolerably large hut, constructed of bamboos and\r\npalm-leaves, very neatly. Several women were seated before it, busily\r\nemployed in making the short petticoats of reeds which they all wore.\r\nTheir hair was very carefully braided in tufts on the crown of the head;\r\nnone were good-looking, except two daughters of the king, about ten and\r\ntwelve years old, who, though very dark, were graceful: these, no doubt,\r\nhe intended for wives for my Francis. We disembarked about a hundred\r\nyards from the hut. The women came to meet us, carrying a branch of the\r\nmimosa in each hand; they then performed a singular kind of dance,\r\nentwining their arms and shaking their feet, but never moving from the\r\nspot; this they accompanied with a wild chant, which was anything but\r\nmusical. The king seemed pleased with it; and, calling his wives and\r\ndaughters, he showed them his _tayo, Bara_ and _Ourou_, calling himself\r\nFritz-Ernest; he then joined in the dance, dragging my sons with him,\r\nwho managed it pretty well. As for me, he treated me with great respect,\r\nalways calling me _écroué_—father, and made me sit down on a large\r\ntrunk of a tree before his house; which was, doubtless, his throne, for\r\nhe placed me there with great ceremony, rubbing his royal nose against\r\nmine. After the dance was concluded, the women retired to the hut, and\r\nreturned to offer us a collation, served up in the shells of cocoa-nuts.\r\nIt was a sort of paste, composed, I believe, of different sorts of\r\nfruit, mixed up with a kind of flour and the milk of the cocoa-nut. This\r\nmixture was detestable to me; but I made up for it with some kernel of\r\ncocoa-nuts and the bread-fruit. Perceiving that I liked these,\r\nBara-ourou ordered some of them to be gathered, and carried to\r\nthe pinnace.\r\n\r\nThe hut was backed by a wood of palms and other trees, so that our\r\nprovision was readily made. Still there was time for my sons to run to\r\nthe pinnace, attended by Parabéry, and bring from the chest some beads,\r\nmirrors, scissors, needles and pins, to distribute to the ladies. When\r\nthey brought the fruit they had gathered, I made a sign to Bara-ourou to\r\ntake them to see the pinnace; he called them, and they followed him\r\ntimidly, and submitting to his wishes in everything, They carried the\r\nfruit two and two, in a sort of baskets, very skilfully woven in rushes,\r\nwhich appeared to have a European form. They had no furniture in their\r\ndwelling but mats, which were doubtless their beds, and some trunks of\r\ntrees, serving for seats and tables. Several baskets were suspended to\r\nthe bamboo which formed the walls, and also lances, slings, clubs, and\r\nother similar weapons; from which I concluded they were a nation of\r\nwarriors. I did not observe much, however, for my thoughts were in the\r\nfuture, and I was very impatient for our departure. I hastened to the\r\npinnace, and my sons distributed their gifts to the females, who did not\r\ndare to express their delight; but it was evident in their countenances.\r\nThey immediately began to adorn themselves with their presents, and\r\nappeared to value the mirrors much more than their husbands had done.\r\nThey soon understood their use, and employed them to arrange with taste\r\nthe strings of beads round their necks, heads, and arms.\r\n\r\nAt last the signal was given for our departure; I rubbed my nose against\r\nthat of the king. I added to my presents a packet of nails, and one of\r\ngilt buttons, which he seemed to covet. I went on board my pinnace, and,\r\nconducted by the good Parabéry, we took our way to that part of the\r\ncoast where the dear ones resided whom I so anxiously desired to see.\r\nSome of the savages accompanied us in their own canoe; we should have\r\npreferred having only our friend Parabéry, but we were not the masters.\r\n\r\nFavoured by the wind, we soon reached the shore we had formerly\r\nquitted, and found our excellent missionary waiting for us.\r\n\r\n“Come,” said he, “you are now going to receive your reward. Your wife\r\nand children impatiently expect you; they would have come to meet you,\r\nbut your wife is still weak, and Jack suffering—your presence will soon\r\ncure them.”\r\n\r\nI was too much affected to answer. Fritz gave me his arm, as much to\r\nsupport me as to restrain himself from rushing on before. Ernest did the\r\nsame with Mr. Willis; his mildness pleased the good man, who also saw\r\nhis taste for study, and tried to encourage it. After half an hour’s\r\nwalk, the missionary told us we were now near our good friends. I saw no\r\nsign of a habitation, nothing but trees and rocks; at last I saw a light\r\nsmoke among the trees, and at that moment Francis, who had been\r\nwatching, ran to meet us.\r\n\r\n“Mamma is expecting you,” said he, showing us the way through a grove of\r\nshrubs, thick enough to hide entirely the entrance into a kind of\r\ngrotto; we had to stoop to pass into it. It resembled much the entrance\r\nof the bear’s den, which we found in the remote part of our island. A\r\nmat of rushes covered the opening, yet permitted the light to penetrate\r\nit. Francis removed the matting, calling—\r\n\r\n“Mamma, here we are!”\r\n\r\nA lady, apparently about twenty-seven years of age, of mild and\r\npleasing appearance, came forward to meet me. She a clothed in a rob\r\nmade of palm-leaves tied together, which reached from her throat to her\r\nfeet, leaving her beautiful arms uncovered. Her light hair was braided\r\nand fastened up round her head.\r\n\r\n“You are welcome,” said she, taking my hand; “you will be my poor\r\nfriend’s best physician.”\r\n\r\nWe entered, and saw my dear wife seated on a bed of moss and leaves; she\r\nwept abundantly, pointing out to me our dear boy by her side. A little\r\nnymph of eleven or twelve years old was endeavouring to raise him.\r\n\r\n“Here are your papa and brothers, Jack,” said she; “you are very happy\r\nin having what I have not: but your papa will be mine, and you shall be\r\nmy brother.”\r\n\r\nJack thanked her affectionately. Fritz and Ernest, kneeling beside the\r\ncouch, embraced their mother. Fritz begged her to forgive him for\r\nhurting his brother; and then tenderly inquired of Jack after his wound.\r\nFor me, I cannot describe my gratitude and agitation; I could scarce\r\nutter a word to my dear wife, who, on her part, sunk down quite overcome\r\non her bed. The lady, who was, I understood, named Madame Hirtel,\r\napproached to assist her. When she recovered, she presented to me Madame\r\nHirtel and her two daughters. The eldest, Sophia, was attending on Jack;\r\nMatilda, who was about ten or eleven years of age, was playing with\r\nFrancis; while the good missionary, on his knees, thanked God for having\r\nre-united us.\r\n\r\n“And for life,” cried my dear wife. “My dear husband, I well knew you\r\nwould set out to seek me; but how could I anticipate that you would ever\r\nsucceed in finding me? We will now separate no more; this beloved friend\r\nhas agreed to accompany us to the Happy Island, as I intend to call it,\r\nif I ever have the happiness to reach it again with all I love in the\r\nworld. How graciously God permits us to derive blessings from our\r\nsorrows. See what my trial has produced me: a friend and two dear\r\ndaughters, for henceforward we are only one family,”\r\n\r\nWe were mutually delighted with this arrangement, and entreated Mr.\r\nWillis to visit us often, and to come and live in the Happy Island when\r\nhis mission was completed.\r\n\r\n“I will consent,” said he, “if you will come and assist me in my duties;\r\nfor which purpose you and your sons must acquire the language of these\r\nislanders. We are much nearer your island than you think, for you took a\r\nvery circuitous course, and Parabéry, who knows it, declares it is only\r\na day’s voyage with a fair wind. And, moreover, he tells me, that he is\r\nso much delighted with you and your sons, that he cannot part with you,\r\nand wishes me to obtain your permission to accompany you, and remain\r\nwith you. He will be exceedingly useful to you: will teach the language\r\nto you all, and will be a ready means of communication between us.”\r\n\r\nI gladly agreed to take Parabéry with us as a friend; but it was no time\r\nyet to think of departing, as Mr. Willis wished to have Jack some days\r\nlonger under his care; we therefore arranged that I and my two sons\r\nshould become his guests, as his hut was but a short distance off. We\r\nhad many things to hear; but, as my wife was yet too weak to relate her\r\nadventures, we resolved first to have the history of Madame Hirtel.\r\nNight coming on, the missionary lighted a gourd lamp, and, after a\r\nlight collation of bread-fruit, Madame Hirtel began her story.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n“My life,” she began, “passed without any remarkable events, till the\r\nmisfortune occurred which brought me to this island. I was married, when\r\nvery young, to Mr. Hirtel, a merchant at Hamburg, an excellent man,\r\nwhose loss I have deeply felt. I was very happy in this union, arranged\r\nby my parents, and sanctioned by reason. We had three children, a son\r\nand two daughters, in the first three years of our marriage; and M.\r\nHirtel, seeing his family increase so rapidly, wished to increase his\r\nincome. An advantageous establishment was offered him in the Canary\r\nIslands; he accepted it, and prevailed on me to settle there, with my\r\nfamily, for some years. My parents were dead, I had no tie to detain me\r\nin Europe. I was going to see new regions, those fortunate isles I had\r\nheard so much of, and I set out joyfully with my husband and children,\r\nlittle foreseeing the misfortunes before me.\r\n\r\n“Our voyage was favourable; the children, like myself, were delighted\r\nwith the novelties of it. I was then twenty-three years old; Sophia,\r\nseven; Matilda, six; and Alfred, our pretty, gentle boy, not yet five.\r\nPoor child! he was the darling and the plaything of all the crew.”\r\n\r\nShe wept bitterly for a few moments, and then resumed her narration.\r\n\r\n“He was as fair as your own Francis, and greatly resembled him. We\r\nproceeded first to Bourdeaux, where my husband had a correspondent, with\r\nwhom he had large dealings; by his means my husband was enabled to raise\r\nlarge sums for his new undertaking. We carried with us, in fact, nearly\r\nhis whole fortune. We re-embarked under the most favourable\r\nauspices—the weather delightful, and the wind fair; but we very soon\r\nhad a change; we were met by a terrible storm and hurricane, such as the\r\nsailors had never witnessed. For a week our ship was tossed about by\r\ncontrary winds, driven into unknown seas, lost all its rigging, and was\r\nat last so broken, that the water poured in on all sides. All was lost,\r\napparently; but, in this extremity, my husband made a last attempt to\r\nsave us. He tied my daughters and myself firmly to a plank, taking the\r\ncharge of my boy himself, as he feared the additional weight would be\r\ntoo much for our raft. His intention was to tie himself to another\r\nplank, to fasten this to ours, and, taking his son in his arms, to give\r\nus a chance of being carried to the shore, which did not appear far off.\r\nWhilst he was occupied in placing us, he gave Alfred to the care of a\r\nsailor who was particularly attached to him. I heard the man say, ‘Leave\r\nhim with me, I will take care to save him.’ On this, M. Hirtel insisted\r\non his restoring him, and I cried out that he should be given to me. At\r\nthat moment the ship, which was already fallen on its side, filled\r\nrapidly with water, plunged, and disappeared with all on board. The\r\nplank on which I and my daughters were fixed alone floated, and I saw\r\nnothing but death and desolation round me.”\r\n\r\nMadame Hirtel paused, almost suffocated by the remembrance of that awful\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\n“Poor woman!” said my wife, weeping, “it is five years since this\r\nmisfortune. It was at the same time as our shipwreck, and was doubtless\r\ncaused by the same storm. But how much more fortunate was I! I lost none\r\nthat were dear to me, and we even had the vessel left for our use. But,\r\nmy dear, unfortunate friend, by what miracle were you saved?”\r\n\r\n“It was He who only can work miracles,” said the missionary, “who cares\r\nfor the widow and the orphan, and without whose word not a hair of the\r\nhead can perish, who at that moment gave courage to the\r\nChristian mother.”\r\n\r\n“My strength,” continued she, “was nearly exhausted, when, after being\r\ntossed about by the furious waves, I found myself thrown upon what I\r\nsupposed to be a sand-bank with my two children. I envied the state of\r\nmy husband and son. If I had not been a mother, I should have wished to\r\nhave followed them; but my two girls lay senseless at my side, and I was\r\nanxious, as I perceived they still breathed, to recover them. At the\r\nmoment M. Hirtel pushed the raft into the water, he threw upon it a box\r\nbound with iron, which I grasped mechanically, and still held, when we\r\nwere left on shore. It was not locked, yet it was with some difficulty,\r\nin my confined position, that I succeeded in opening it. It contained a\r\nquantity of gold and bank-notes, which I looked upon with contempt, and\r\nregret. But there was something useful in the box. In the morocco\r\nportfolio which contained the bank-notes, there were the usual little\r\ninstruments—a knife, scissors, pencils, stiletto, and also a small\r\nbottle of Eau de Cologne, which was particularly serviceable in\r\nrestoring my children. I began by cutting the cords that tied us. I then\r\nrubbed my dear children with the Eau de Cologne, made them inhale it,\r\nand even swallow a little. The wind was still blowing, but the clouds\r\nbegan to break, and the sun appeared, which dried and warmed us. My poor\r\nchildren opened their eyes, and knew me, and I felt I was not utterly\r\ncomfortless; but their first words were to ask for their father and\r\nbrother. I could not tell them they were no more. I tried to deceive\r\nmyself, to support my strength, by a feeble and delusive hope. M. Hirtel\r\nswam well, the sailor still better; and the last words I had heard still\r\nrung in my ears—‘Do not be uneasy, I will save the child.’ If I saw\r\nanything floating at a distance, my heart began to beat, and I ran\r\ntowards the water; but I saw it was only wreck, which I could not even\r\nreach. Some pieces were, however, thrown on shore, and with these and\r\nour own raft I was enabled to make a sort of shelter, by resting them\r\nagainst a rock. My poor children, by crouching under this, sheltered\r\nthemselves from the rain, or from the rays of the sun. I had the good\r\nfortune to preserve a large beaver hat, which I wore at the time, and\r\nthis protected me; but these resources gave me little consolation; my\r\nchildren were complaining of hunger, and I felt only how much we were in\r\nwant of. I had seen a shell-fish on the shore, resembling the oyster,\r\nor muscle. I collected some, and, opening them with my knife, we made a\r\nrepast on them, which sufficed for the first day. Night came—my\r\nchildren offered up their evening prayer, and I earnestly besought the\r\nsuccour of the Almighty. I then lay down beside my babes on our raft, as\r\nconveniently as we could, and they soon slept. The fearful thoughts of\r\nthe past, and dreadful anticipations of the future, prevented me from\r\nsleeping. My situation was indeed melancholy; but I felt, as a mother, I\r\nought not to wish for death.\r\n\r\n“As soon as day broke, I went close to the shore, to seek some\r\nshell-fish for our breakfast. In crossing the sand, I nearly plunged my\r\nfoot into a hole, and fancied I heard a crash. I stooped, and putting my\r\nhand into the opening, found it was full of eggs; I had broken two or\r\nthree, which I tasted, and thought very good. From the colour, form, and\r\ntaste, I knew them to be turtle’s eggs; there were at least sixty, so I\r\nhad no more care about food. I carried away in my apron as many as I\r\ncould preserve from the rays of the sun: this I endeavoured to effect by\r\nburying them in the sand, and covering them with one end of our plank,\r\nand succeeded very well. Besides these, there were as many to be found\r\non the shore as we required; I have sometimes found as many as ninety\r\ntogether. These were our sole support while we remained there: my\r\nchildren liked them very much. I forgot to add, that I was fortunate\r\nenough to discover a stream of fresh water, running into the sea; it was\r\nthe same which runs past this house, and which conducted me here. The\r\nfirst day we suffered greatly from thirst, but on the second we met\r\nwith the stream which saved us. I will not tire you by relating day by\r\nday our sad life; every one was the same, and took away by degrees every\r\nhope from me. As long as I dared to indulge any, I could not bear to\r\nleave the shore; but at last it became insupportable to me. I was worn\r\nout with gazing continually on that boundless horizon, and that moving\r\ncrystal which had swallowed up my hopes. I pined for the verdure and\r\nshade of trees. Although I had contrived to make for my daughters little\r\nhats of a marine rush, they suffered much from the extreme heat,—the\r\nburning rays of a tropical sun. I decided at last to abandon that sandy\r\nshore; to penetrate, at all risks, into the country, in order to seek a\r\nshady and cooler abode, and to escape from the view of that sea which\r\nwas so painful to me. I resolved not to quit the stream which was so\r\nprecious to us, for, not having any vessel to contain water, I could not\r\ncarry it with us. Sophia, who is naturally quick, formed, from a large\r\nleaf, a sort of goblet, which served us to drink from; and I filled my\r\npockets with turtles’ eggs, as provision for a few days. I then set off\r\nwith my two children, after praying the God of all mercy to watch over\r\nus; and, taking leave of the vast tomb which held my husband and my son,\r\nI never lost sight of the stream; if any obstacle obliged me to turn a\r\nlittle way from it, I soon recovered my path. My eldest daughter, who\r\nwas very strong and robust, followed me stoutly, as I took care not to\r\nwalk too far without resting; but I was often compelled to carry my\r\nlittle Matilda on my shoulders. Both were delighted with the shade of\r\nthe woods, and were so amused with the delightful birds that inhabited\r\nthem, and a pretty little sportive green monkey, that they became as\r\nplayful as ever. They sang and prattled; but often asked me if papa and\r\nAlfred would not soon return to see these pretty creatures, and if we\r\nwere going to seek them. These words rent my heart, and I thought it\r\nbest then to tell them they would meet no more on earth, and that they\r\nwere both gone to heaven, to that good God to whom they prayed morning\r\nand evening. Sophia was very thoughtful, and the tears ran down her\r\ncheeks: ‘I will pray to God more than ever,’ said she, ‘that he may make\r\nthem happy, and send them back to us,’ ‘Mamma,’ said Matilda, ‘have we\r\nleft the sea to go to heaven? Shall we soon be there? And shall we see\r\nbeautiful birds like these?’ We walked on very slowly, making frequent\r\nrests, till night drew on, and it was necessary to find a place for\r\nrepose. I fixed on a sort of thick grove, which I could only enter by\r\nstooping; it was formed of one tree, whose branches, reaching the\r\nground, take root there, and soon produce other stems, which follow the\r\nsame course, and become, in time, an almost impenetrable thicket. Here I\r\nfound a place for us to lie down, which appeared sheltered from wild\r\nbeasts or savages, whom I equally dreaded. We had still some eggs, which\r\nwe ate; but I saw with fear that the time approached when we must have\r\nmore food, which I knew not where to find. I saw, indeed, some fruits on\r\nthe trees, but I did not know them, and feared to give them to my\r\nchildren, who wished to have them. I saw also cocoa-nuts, but quite out\r\nof my reach; and even if I could have got them, I did not know how to\r\nopen them. The tree under whose branches we had found protection was, I\r\nconjectured, an American fig-tree; it bore a quantity of fruit, very\r\nsmall and red, and like the European fig. I ventured to taste them, and\r\nfound them inferior to ours,—insipid and soft,—but, I thought, quite\r\nharmless. I remarked that the little green monkeys ate them greedily, so\r\nI had no more fear, and allowed my children to regale themselves. I was\r\nmuch more afraid of wild beasts during the night; however, I had seen\r\nnothing worse than some little quadrupeds resembling the rabbit or\r\nsquirrel, which came in numbers to shelter themselves during the night\r\nunder our tree. The children wished to catch one, but I could not\r\nundertake to increase my charge. We had a quiet night, and were early\r\nawaked by the songs of the birds. How delighted I was to have escaped\r\nthe noise of the waves, and to feel the freshness of the woods, and the\r\nperfume of the flowers, with which my children made garlands, to\r\ndecorate my head and their own! These ornaments, during this time of\r\nmourning and bereavement, affected me painfully, and I was weak enough\r\nto forbid them this innocent pleasure; I tore away my garland, and threw\r\nit into the rivulet. ‘Gather flowers,’ said I, ‘but do not dress\r\nyourselves in them; they are no fitting ornaments for us; your father\r\nand Alfred cannot see them.’ They were silent and sad, and threw their\r\ngarlands into the water, as I had done.\r\n\r\n“We followed the stream, and passed two more nights under the trees. We\r\nhad the good fortune to find more figs; but they did not satisfy us, and\r\nour eggs were exhausted. In my distress I almost decided to return to\r\nthe shore, where we might at least meet with that nourishment. As I sat\r\nby the stream, reflecting mournfully on our situation, the children, who\r\nhad been throwing stones into the water, cried out, ‘Look, mamma, what\r\npretty fishes!’ I saw, indeed, a quantity of small salmon-trout in the\r\nriver; but how could I take them? I tried to seize them with my hands,\r\nbut could not catch them; necessity, however, is the mother of\r\ninvention. I cut a number of branches with my knife, and wove them\r\ntogether to make a kind of light hurdle, the breadth of the stream,\r\nwhich was very narrow just here. I made two of these; my daughters\r\nassisted me, and were soon very skilful. We then undressed ourselves,\r\nand took a bath, which refreshed us much. I placed one of my hurdles\r\nupright across the rivulet, and the second a little lower. The fishes\r\nwho remained between attempted to pass, but the hurdles were woven too\r\nclose. We watched for them attempting the other passage; many escaped\r\nus, but we captured sufficient for our dinner. We threw them out upon\r\nthe grass, at a distance from the stream, so that they could not leap\r\nback. My daughters had taken more than I; but the sensible Sophia threw\r\nback those we did not require, to give them pleasure, she said, and\r\nMatilda did the same, to see them leap. We then removed our hurdles,\r\ndressed ourselves, and I began to consider how I should cook my fish;\r\nfor I had no fire, and had never kindled one myself. However, I had\r\noften seen Mr. Hirtel, who was a smoker, light his pipe by means of the\r\nflint and steel; they were in the precious morocco case, together with\r\ntinder and matches. I tried to strike a light, and after some\r\ndifficulty succeeded. I collected the fragments of the branches used for\r\nthe hurdles, the children gathered some dry leaves, and I had soon a\r\nbright, lively fire, which I was delighted to see, notwithstanding the\r\nheat of the climate. I scraped the scales from the fish with my knife,\r\nwashed them in the rivulet, and then placed them on the fire to broil;\r\nthis was my apprenticeship in the art of cookery. I thought how useful\r\nit would be to give young ladies some knowledge of the useful arts; for\r\nwho can foresee what they may need? Our European dinner delighted us as\r\nmuch as the bath and the fishing which had preceded it. I decided to fix\r\nour residence at the side of the rivulet, and beneath the fig-trees; my\r\nonly objection being the fear of missing some passing vessel which might\r\ncarry us back to Europe. But can you understand my feelings, when I\r\nconfess to you that, although overcome by sorrow and desolation, having\r\nlost husband, son, and fortune, knowing that in order to support myself\r\nand bring up my children I must depend upon my friends, and to attain\r\nthis having to hazard again the dangers of the sea, the very thought of\r\nwhich made me shudder, I should prefer to remain where Providence had\r\nbrought me, and live calmly without obligation to any one? I might\r\ncertainly have some difficulty in procuring the means of supporting a\r\nlife which was dear to me for the sake of my children; but even this was\r\nan employment and an amusement. My children would early learn to bear\r\nprivations, to content themselves with a simple and frugal life, and to\r\nlabour for their own support. I might teach them all that I knew would\r\nbe useful to them in future, and above all, impress upon their young\r\nminds the great truths of our holy religion. By bringing this constantly\r\nbefore their unsophisticated understanding, I might hope they would draw\r\nfrom it the necessary virtues of resignation and contentment. I was only\r\ntwenty-three years of age, and might hope, by God’s mercy, to be spared\r\nto them some time, and in the course of years who knew what might\r\nhappen? Besides we were not so far from the sea but that I might visit\r\nit sometimes, if it were only to seek for turtles’ eggs. I remained then\r\nunder our fig-tree at night, and by day on the borders of the stream.”\r\n\r\n“It was under a fig-tree, also,” said my wife, “that I have spent four\r\nhappy years of my life. Unknown to each other, our fate has been\r\nsimilar; but henceforward I hope we shall not be separated.”\r\n\r\nMadame Hirtel embraced her kind friend, and observing that the evening\r\nwas advanced, and that my wife, after such agitation, needed repose, we\r\nagreed to defer till next day the conclusion of the interesting\r\nnarrative. My elder sons and myself followed the missionary to his hut,\r\nwhich resembled the king’s _palace_, though it was smaller; it was\r\nconstructed of bamboos, bound together, and the intervals filled with\r\nmoss and clay; it was covered in the same way, and was tolerably solid.\r\nA mat in one corner, without any covering, formed his bed; but he\r\nbrought out a bear’s skin, which he used in winter, and which he now\r\nspread on the ground for us. I had observed a similar one in the grotto,\r\nand he told us we should hear the history of these skins next day, in\r\nthe continuation of the story of Emily, or _Mimi_, as she was\r\naffectionately called by all. We retired to our couch, after a prayer\r\nfrom Mr. Willis; and for the first time since my dear wife was taken\r\nfrom me, I slept in peace.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe went to the grotto early in the morning, and found our two invalids\r\nmuch improved: my wife had slept better, and Mr. Willis found Jack’s\r\nwound going on well. Madame _Mimi_ told her daughters to prepare\r\nbreakfast: they went out and soon returned, with a native woman and a\r\nboy of four or five years old, carrying newly-made rush baskets filled\r\nwith all sorts of fruit: figs, guavas, strawberries, cocoa-nuts, and the\r\nbread-fruit.\r\n\r\n“I must introduce you,” said Emily, “to the rest of my family: this is\r\nCanda, the wife of your friend Parabéry, and this is their son,\r\n_Minou-minou_, whom I regard as my own. Your Elizabeth is already\r\nattached to them, and bespeaks your friendship for them. They will\r\nfollow us to the Happy Island.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, if you knew,” said Francis, “what a well-behaved boy Minou is! He\r\ncan climb trees, run, and leap, though he is less than I am. He must be\r\nmy friend.”\r\n\r\n“And Canda,” said Elizabeth, “shall be our assistant and friend.”\r\n\r\nShe gave her hand to Canda, I did the same, and caressed the boy, who\r\nseemed delighted with me, and, to my great surprise, spoke to me in very\r\ngood German—the mother, too, knew several words of the language. They\r\nbusied themselves with our breakfast: opened the cocoa-nuts, and poured\r\nthe milk into the shells, after separating the kernel; they arranged the\r\nfruits on the trunk of a tree, which served for a table, and did great\r\ncredit to the talent of their instructress.\r\n\r\n“I should have liked to have offered you coffee,” said Madame Hirtel,\r\n“which grows in this island, but having no utensils for roasting,\r\ngrinding, or preparing it, it has been useless to me, and I have not\r\neven gathered it.”\r\n\r\n“Do you think, my dear, that it would grow in our island?” said my wife\r\nto me, in some anxiety.\r\n\r\nI then recollected, for the first time, how fond my wife was of coffee,\r\nwhich, in Europe, had always been her favourite breakfast. There would\r\ncertainly be in the ship some bags, which I might have brought away; but\r\nI had never thought of it, and my unselfish wife, not seeing it, had\r\nnever named it, except once wishing we had some to plant in the garden.\r\nNow that there was a probability of obtaining it, she confessed that\r\ncoffee and bread were the only luxuries she regretted. I promised to try\r\nand cultivate it in our island; foreseeing, however, that it would\r\nprobably not be of the best quality, I told her she must not expect\r\nMocha; but her long privation from this delicious beverage had made her\r\nless fastidious, and she assured me it would be a treat to her. After\r\nbreakfast, we begged Madame Hirtel to resume her interesting narrative.\r\nShe continued:\r\n\r\n“After the reflections on my situation, which I told you of last night,\r\nI determined only to return to the sea-shore, when our food failed us in\r\nthe woods; but I acquired other means of procuring it. Encouraged by\r\nthe success of my fishing, I made a sort of net from the filaments of\r\nthe bark of a tree and a plant resembling hemp. With these I succeeded\r\nin catching some birds: one, resembling our thrush, was very fat, and of\r\ndelicious flavour. I had the greatest difficulty in overcoming my\r\nrepugnance to taking away their life; nothing but the obligation of\r\npreserving our own could have reconciled me to it. My children plucked\r\nthem; I then spitted them on a slender branch and roasted them before\r\nthe fire. I also found some nests of eggs, which I concluded were those\r\nof the wild ducks which frequented our stream. I made myself acquainted\r\nwith all the fruits which the monkeys and parroquets eat, and which were\r\nnot out of my reach. I found a sort of acorn which had the flavour of a\r\nnut. The children also discovered plenty of large strawberries, a\r\ndelicious repast; and I found a quantity of honeycomb in the hollow of a\r\ntree, which I obtained by stupifying the bees with a smoking brand.\r\n\r\n“I took care to mark down every day on the blank leaves of my\r\npocket-book. I had now marked thirty days of my wandering life on the\r\nborder of the river, for I never strayed beyond the sound of its waters.\r\nStill I kept continually advancing towards the interior of the island. I\r\nhad yet met with nothing alarming, and the weather had been most\r\nfavourable; but we were not long to enjoy this comfort. The rainy season\r\ncame on: and one night, to my great distress, I heard it descend in\r\ntorrents. We were no longer under our fig-tree, which would have\r\nsheltered us for a considerable time. The tree under which we now were\r\nhad tempted me by having several cavities between the roots, filled with\r\nsoft moss, which formed natural couches, but the foliage was very thin,\r\nand we were soon drenched completely. I crept near my poor children to\r\nprotect them a little, but in vain; our little bed was soon filled with\r\nwater, and we were compelled to leave it. Our clothes were so heavy with\r\nthe rain that we could scarcely stand; and the night was so dark that we\r\ncould see no road, and ran the risk of falling, or striking against some\r\ntree, if we moved. My children wept, and I trembled for their health,\r\nand for my own, which was so necessary to them. This was one of the most\r\nterrible nights of my pilgrimage. My children and I knelt down, and I\r\nprayed to our Heavenly Father for strength to bear this trial, if it was\r\nhis will to continue it. I felt consolation and strength from my\r\nprayers, and rose with courage and confidence; and though the rain\r\ncontinued unabated, I waited with resignation the pleasure of the\r\nAlmighty. I reconciled my children to our situation; and Sophia told me\r\nshe had asked her father, who was near the gracious God, to entreat Him\r\nto send no more rain, but let the sun come back. I assured them God\r\nwould not forget them; they began to be accustomed to the rain, only\r\nSophia begged they might take off their clothes, and then it would be\r\nlike a bath in the brook. I consented to this, thinking they would be\r\nless liable to suffer than by wearing their wet garments.\r\n\r\n“The day began to break, and I determined to walk on without stopping,\r\nin order to warm ourselves by the motion; and to try to find some cave,\r\nsome hollow tree, or some tree with thick foliage, to shelter us the\r\nnext night.\r\n\r\n“I undressed the children, and made a bundle of their clothes, which I\r\nwould have carried myself, but I found they would not be too heavy for\r\nthem, and I judged it best to accustom them early to the difficulties,\r\nfatigue, and labour, which would be their lot; and to attend entirely on\r\nthemselves; I, therefore, divided the clothes into two unequal bundles,\r\nproportioned to their strength, and having made a knot in each, I passed\r\na slender branch through it, and showed them how to carry it on their\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n“When I saw them walking before me in this savage fashion, with their\r\nlittle white bodies exposed to the storm, I could not refrain from\r\ntears. I blamed myself for condemning them to such an existence, and\r\nthought of returning to the shore, where some vessel might rescue us;\r\nbut we were now too far off to set about it. I continued to proceed with\r\nmuch more difficulty than my children, who had nothing on but their\r\nshoes and large hats. I carried the valuable box, in which I had placed\r\nthe remains of our last night’s supper, an act of necessary prudence, as\r\nthere was neither fishing nor hunting now.\r\n\r\n“As the day advanced, the rain diminished, and even the sun appeared\r\nabove the horizon.\r\n\r\n“‘Look, my darlings,’ said I, ‘God has heard us, and sent his sun to\r\nwarm and cheer us. Let us thank him,’\r\n\r\n“‘Papa has begged it of him!’ said Matilda. ‘Oh! mamma, let us pray him\r\nto send Alfred back!’\r\n\r\n“My poor little girl bitterly regretted the loss of her brother. Even\r\nnow she can scarcely hear his name without tears. When the savages\r\nbrought Francis to us, she at first took him for her brother. ‘Oh, how\r\nyou have grown in heaven!’ cried she; and, after she discovered he was\r\nnot her brother, she often said to him, ‘How I wish your name\r\nwas Alfred!’\r\n\r\n“Forgive me for dwelling so long on the details of my wretched journey,\r\nwhich was not without its comforts, in the pleasure I took in the\r\ndevelopment of my children’s minds, and in forming plans for their\r\nfuture education. Though anything relating to science, or the usual\r\naccomplishments, would be useless to them, I did not wish to bring them\r\nup like young savages; I hoped to be able to communicate much useful\r\nknowledge to them, and to give them juster ideas of this world and\r\nthat to come.\r\n\r\n“As soon as the sun had dried them, I made them put on their dresses,\r\nand we continued our walk by the brook, till we arrived at the grove\r\nwhich is before this rock. I removed the branches to pass through it,\r\nand saw beyond them the entrance to this grotto. It was very low and\r\nnarrow; but I could not help uttering a cry of joy, for this was the\r\nonly sort of retreat that could securely shelter us. I was going to\r\nenter it without thought, not reflecting there might be in it some\r\nferocious animal, when I was arrested by a plaintive cry, more like that\r\nof a child than a wild beast; I advanced with more caution, and tried to\r\nfind out what sort of an inhabitant the cave contained. It was indeed a\r\nhuman being!—an infant, whose age I could not discover; but it seemed\r\ntoo young to walk, and was, besides, tied up in leaves and moss,\r\nenclosed in a piece of bark, which was much torn and rent. The poor\r\ninfant uttered the most piteous cries, and I did not hesitate a moment\r\nto enter the cave, and to take the innocent little creature in my arms;\r\nit ceased its cries as soon as it felt the warmth of my cheek; but it\r\nwas evidently in want of food, and I had nothing to give it but some\r\nfigs, of which I pressed the juice into its mouth; this seemed to\r\nsatisfy it, and, rocking it in my arms, it soon went to sleep. I had\r\nthen time to examine it, and to look round the cave. From the size and\r\nform of the face, I concluded it might be older than I had first\r\nthought; and I recollected to have read that the savages carried their\r\nchildren swaddled up in this way, even till they could walk. The\r\ncomplexion of the child was a pale olive, which I have since discovered\r\nis the natural complexion of the natives, before the exposure to the\r\nheat of the sun gives them the bronze hue you have seen; the features\r\nwere good, except that the lips were thicker and the mouth larger than\r\nthose of the Europeans. My two girls were charmed with it, and caressed\r\nit with great joy. I left them to rock it gently in its cradle of bark,\r\ntill I went round this cave, which I intended for my palace, and which I\r\nhave never quitted. You see it—the form is not changed; but, since\r\nHeaven has sent me a friend,” looking at the missionary, “it is adorned\r\nwith furniture and utensils which have completed my comforts. But\r\nto return.\r\n\r\n“The grotto was spacious, and irregular in form. In a hollow I found,\r\nwith surprise, a sort of bed, carefully arranged with moss, dry leaves,\r\nand small twigs. I was alarmed. Was this grotto inhabited by men or by\r\nwild beasts? In either case, it was dangerous to remain here. I\r\nencouraged a hope, however, that, from the infant being here, the mother\r\nmust be the inhabitant, and that, on her return, finding me nursing her\r\nchild, she might be induced to share her asylum with us. I could not,\r\nhowever, reconcile this hope with the circumstance of the child being\r\nabandoned in this open cave.\r\n\r\n“As I was considering whether I ought to remain, or leave the cave, I\r\nheard strange cries at a distance, mingled with the screams of my\r\nchildren, who came running to me for protection, bringing with them the\r\nyoung savage, who fortunately was only half awaked, and soon went to\r\nsleep again, sucking a fig. I laid him gently on the bed of leaves, and\r\ntold my daughters to remain near him in a dark corner; then, stepping\r\ncautiously, I ventured to look out to discover what was passing, without\r\nbeing seen. The noise approached nearer, to my great alarm, and I could\r\nperceive, through the trees, a crowd of men armed with long pointed\r\nlances, clubs, and stones; they appeared furious, and the idea that they\r\nmight enter the cave froze me with terror. I had an idea of taking the\r\nlittle native babe, and holding it in my arms, as my best shield; but\r\nthis time my fears were groundless. The whole troop passed outside the\r\nwood, without even looking on the same side as the grotto; they appeared\r\nto follow some traces they were looking out for on the ground. I heard\r\ntheir shouts for some time, but they died away, and I recovered from my\r\nfears. Still, the dread of meeting them overcame even hunger. I had\r\nnothing left in my box but some figs, which I kept for the infant, who\r\nwas satisfied with them, and I told my daughters we must go to bed\r\nwithout supper. The sleeping infant amused them so much, that they\r\nreadily consented to give up the figs. He awoke smiling, and they gave\r\nhim the figs to suck. In the mean time, I prepared to release him from\r\nhis bondage to make him more comfortable; and I then saw that the outer\r\ncovering of bark was torn by the teeth of some animal, and even the skin\r\nof the child slightly grazed. I ventured to carry him to the brook, into\r\nwhich I plunged him two or three times, which seemed to give him\r\ngreat pleasure.\r\n\r\n“I ran back to the cave, which is, you see, not more than twenty yards\r\ndistant, and found Sophia and Matilda very much delighted at a treasure\r\nthey had found under the dry leaves in a corner. This was a great\r\nquantity of fruits of various kinds, roots of some unknown plant, and a\r\ngood supply of beautiful honey, on which the little gluttons were\r\nalready feasting. They came directly to give some on their fingers to\r\ntheir little doll, as they called the babe. This discovery made me very\r\nthoughtful. Was it possible that we were in a bear’s den! I had read\r\nthat they sometimes carried off infants and that they were very fond of\r\nfruits and of honey, of which they generally had a hoard. I remarked on\r\nthe earth, and especially at the entrance, where the rain had made it\r\nsoft, the impression of large paws which left me no doubt. The animal\r\nwould certainly return to his den, and we were in the greatest danger;\r\nbut where could we go? The sky, dark with clouds, threatened a return of\r\nthe storm; and the troop of savages might still be wandering about the\r\nisland. I had not courage, just as night set in, to depart with my\r\nchildren; nor could I leave the poor infant, who was now sleeping\r\npeacefully, after his honey and figs. His two nurses soon followed his\r\nexample; but for me there was no rest; the noise of the wind among the\r\ntrees, and of the rain pattering on the leaves,—the murmur of the\r\nbrook,—the light bounds of the kangaroo,—all made my heart beat with\r\nfear and terror; I fancied it was the bear returning to devour us. I had\r\ncut and broken some branches to place before the entrance; but these\r\nwere but a weak defence against a furious and probably famished animal;\r\nand if he even did no other harm to my children, I was sure their terror\r\nat the sight of him would kill them. I paced backwards and forwards,\r\nfrom the entrance to the bed, in the darkness, envying the dear sleepers\r\ntheir calm and fearless rest; the dark-skinned baby slept soundly,\r\nnestled warmly between my daughters, till day broke at last, without\r\nanything terrible occurring. Then my little people awoke, and cried out\r\nwith hunger. We ate of the fruits and honey brought us by our unknown\r\nfriend, feeding, also, our little charge, to whom my daughters gave the\r\npet name of _Minou_, which he still keeps.\r\n\r\n“I busied myself with his _toilette_. There was no need to go to the\r\nbrook for a bath, for the rain came down incessantly. I then folded\r\nMatilda’s apron round him, which pleased her greatly. The rain ceased\r\nfor a while, and they set off for flowers to amuse him. They were\r\nscarcely gone when I heard the cries of the savages again; but this\r\ntime they seemed rather shouts of joy and triumph; they sung and\r\nchaunted a sort of chorus; but were still at such distance that I had\r\ntime to recall my daughters, and withdrew them out of sight. I took\r\n_Minou_ with me as a mediator, and placed myself in an angle of the\r\nrock, where I could see without being seen. They passed, as before,\r\nbeyond the wood, armed, and two of them bore at the end of their\r\nlances something very large and dark, which I could not distinguish,\r\nbut thought might be some wild beast they had destroyed; afterwards,\r\nI flattered myself it might be the bear, whose return I so greatly\r\ndreaded. Following the train was a woman, naked, with her hair hanging\r\ndown, uttering loud cries, and tearing her face and breast. No one\r\nattempted to soothe her; but occasionally one of the bearers of the\r\nblack mass pointed it out to her; she then became furious, threw\r\nherself on it, and tried to tear it with her teeth and nails. I was\r\nquite overcome with horror and pity.\r\n\r\n“That woman, my friends, was Canda, whom you have just seen. Canda,\r\nusually so mild and gentle, was rendered frantic by the loss of her\r\nchild,—her first-born,—whom she believed was devoured by the bear.\r\nParabéry, her husband, tried to console her, but was himself in great\r\nsorrow. These bears, as I have since learnt, for there were two of them,\r\nhad come from a mountain, at the foot of which was Parabéry’s hut. They\r\nhad only this son, and Canda, according to the custom of the country,\r\ntying it in a piece of bark, carried it on her back. One morning, after\r\nhaving bathed him in the stream, which has its source near their abode,\r\nshe placed him on the turf a few moments, while she was employed in\r\nsome household duties. She soon heard his cries, mingled with a sort of\r\ngrowl; she ran to the spot, and saw a frightful beast holding her child\r\nin its mouth, and running off with it. It was then more than twenty\r\nyards off; her cries brought her husband; she pointed to the horrible\r\nanimal, and darted after it, determined to save her child or perish. Her\r\nhusband only stopped to seize his javelin, and followed her, but did not\r\novertake her till fatigue and the heat of the day made her fall, almost\r\nsenseless, on the ground. Stopping for a moment to raise and encourage\r\nher, he lost sight of the bear, and could not recover the track. All the\r\nnight,—that dreadful night of rain, when I was weeping and murmuring,\r\nthinking myself the most unfortunate of women,—was Canda exposed,\r\nwithout clothes, to that frightful storm, hopelessly seeking her only\r\nchild, and not even feeling that it did rain. Parabéry, not less\r\nafflicted, but more composed, went to relate his misfortune to his\r\nneighbours, who, arming themselves, set out, with Parabéry at their\r\nhead, following the track of the animal over the wet ground. They\r\ndiscovered it next morning with another bear, so busy devouring a swarm\r\nof bees and their honey, that the savages were able to draw near them.\r\nParabéry pierced one with his spear, and despatched him with a blow of\r\nhis club; one of his comrades killed the other, and Parabéry tasted the\r\ntruly savage joy of vengeance. But the poor mother could not be so\r\ncomforted. After wandering through the rain all night, she reached the\r\nparty as they were skinning the bear and dividing the flesh. Parabéry\r\nonly asked and obtained the skins, to recompense him for the loss of his\r\nson. They returned home in triumph, Canda following them with bitter\r\ncries, tearing her face with a shark’s tooth. From observation of these\r\ncircumstances, I concluded that Canda must be the mother of my little\r\n_protégé_. My heart sympathized with her, and I even made some steps\r\nforward to restore him; but the sight of the savage crowd, with their\r\ntattooed bodies, filled me with such terror, that I retreated\r\ninvoluntarily to the grotto, where my children, alarmed by the noise,\r\nwere hiding themselves.\r\n\r\n“‘Why do the people cry out so?’ said Sophia, ‘they frighten me. Don’t\r\nlet them come here, mamma, or they may carry Minou away,’\r\n\r\n“‘Certainly,’ said I; ‘and I should have no right to forbid them. I\r\nthink they are his friends who are distressed at losing him; I wish I\r\ncould restore him to them.’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, no! mamma,’ said Matilda. ‘Pray don’t give him back; we like him\r\nso much, and we will be his little mammas. He will be far happier with\r\nus than with those ugly savages, who tied him up like a parcel in the\r\nbark, with the moss which pricked him so much; he is much more\r\ncomfortable in my apron. How he moves his legs as if he wanted to walk;\r\nSophia and I will teach him. Do let us keep him, mimi.’\r\n\r\n“Even if I had decided, it was now too late; the savages had passed on\r\nto some distance. I, however, explained to Matilda the beauty of the\r\ndivine precept, ‘Do unto others as you would they should do unto you,’\r\nasking her how she would have liked to be detained by the savages, and\r\nwhat, then, would be the suffering of her own mamma? She was thoughtful\r\nfor a moment, and then, embracing Minou and me, ‘You are right, mamma\r\nmimi; but if she loves her baby, let her come and seek him,’ said the\r\nlittle rebel. In the mean time, Sophia had been out, and returned with\r\nsome brilliant flowers, fresh after the rain, with which they made\r\ngarlands to dress up the infant. ‘Oh! if his mamma saw him, she would be\r\nglad to let us have him,’ said Matilda. She then explained to her sister\r\nwho this mamma was, and Sophia shed tears to think of the sorrow of the\r\npoor mother. ‘But how do you know, mamma, that she was Minou’s mother?’\r\ndemanded she. This question proved that her judgment was forming, and I\r\ntook the opportunity of teaching her what information one may derive\r\nfrom observation. She understood me very well; and when I told her on\r\nwhat I had founded my idea, she trembled to think he had been brought\r\nhere by a bear, and asked me if the bear would have eaten him.\r\n\r\n“‘I cannot answer for it,’ said I, ‘if it had been pressed by hunger;\r\nthey tell us, that the bear does no harm to man unless attacked, and is\r\nespecially fond of children. But, notwithstanding this, I should not\r\nlike to trust it. At all events, the poor babe would have died, if we\r\nhad not found him.’\r\n\r\n“‘Poor babe, he shall not die of hunger now,’ said she. ‘Let us give him\r\nsome figs; but these are not good; we must go and seek some more.’\r\n\r\n“The rain having ceased, I consented, passing through the grove, where\r\nthere are no fig-trees, to search farther. My daughters had fed the\r\nchild with honey and water; it appeared quite reconciled to us, and had\r\nceased to cry. I judged it might be about eight months old. We soon\r\nfound some trees covered with the violet-coloured figs. Whilst I\r\ngathered them, the girls made a pretty bed of moss, adorned with\r\nflowers, for their little favourite, and fed him with the fresh fruit,\r\nwhich he enjoyed much; and with their fair hair and rosy faces, and the\r\nlittle negro between them, with his arch, dark countenance, they formed\r\na charming picture, which affected me greatly.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n“We had been more than an hour under the tree, when I heard cries again;\r\nbut this time I was not alarmed, for I distinguished the voice of the\r\ndisconsolate mother, and I knew that I could comfort her. Her grief\r\nbrought her back to the spot where she thought her child had been\r\ndevoured; she wished, as she afterwards told us, when we could\r\nunderstand her, to search for some remains of him,—his hair, his bones,\r\nor even a piece of the bark that bound him; and here he was, full of\r\nlife and health. She advanced slowly, sobbing, and her eyes turned to\r\nthe ground. She was so absorbed in her search, that she did not see us\r\nwhen we were but twenty yards from her. Suddenly, Sophia darted like an\r\narrow to her, took her hand, and said, ‘Come, Minou is here.’\r\n\r\n“Canda neither knew what she saw nor what she heard; she took my\r\ndaughter for something supernatural, and made no resistance, but\r\nfollowed her to the fig-tree. Even then she did not recognize the\r\nlittle creature, released from his bonds, half-clothed, covered with\r\nflowers, and surrounded by three divinities, for she took us for such,\r\nand wished to prostrate herself before us. She was still more convinced\r\nof it when I took up her son, and placed him in her arms: she recognized\r\nhim, and the poor little infant held out his arms to her. I can never\r\nexpress to you the transport of the mother; she screamed, clasped her\r\nchild till he was half-suffocated, rapidly repeating words which we\r\ncould not understand, wept, laughed, and was in a delirium of delight\r\nthat terrified Minou. He began to cry, and held out his arms to Sophia,\r\nwho, as well as Matilda, was weeping at the sight. Canda looked at them\r\nwith astonishment; she soothed the child, and put him to her breast,\r\nwhich he rejected at first, but finally seized it, and his mother was\r\nhappy. I took the opportunity to try and make her comprehend, that the\r\ngreat animal had brought him here; that we had found him, and taken care\r\nof him; and I made signs for her to follow me, which she did without\r\nhesitation, till we reached the grotto, when, without entering, she fled\r\naway with her infant with such rapidity, that it was impossible to\r\novertake her, and was soon out of sight.\r\n\r\n“I had some difficulty in consoling my daughters for the loss of Minou;\r\nthey thought they should see him no more, and that his mother was very\r\nungrateful to carry him off, without even letting them take leave of\r\nhim. They were still weeping and complaining, when we saw the objects of\r\nour anxiety approaching; but Canda was now accompanied by a man, who was\r\ncarrying the child. They entered the grotto, and prostrated themselves\r\nbefore us. You know Parabéry; his countenance pleased and tranquillized\r\nus. As a relation of the king, he was distinguished by wearing a short\r\ntunic of leaves; his body was tattooed and stained with various colours;\r\nbut not his face, which expressed kindness and gratitude, united with\r\ngreat intelligence. He comprehended most of my signs. I did not succeed\r\nso well in understanding him; but saw he meant kindly. In the mean time\r\nmy daughters had a more intelligible conversation with Canda and Minou;\r\nthey half-devoured the latter with caresses, fed him with figs and\r\nhoney, and amused him so much, that he would scarcely leave them. Canda\r\nwas not jealous of this preference, but seemed delighted with it; she,\r\nin her turn, caressed my daughters, admired their glossy hair and fair\r\nskin, and pointed them out to her husband; she repeated Minou after\r\nthem, but always added another _Minou_, and appeared to think this name\r\nbeautiful. After some words with Parabéry, she placed Minou-Minou in\r\nSophia’s arms, and they both departed, making signs that they would\r\nreturn; but we did not see them for some time after. Sophia and Matilda\r\nhad their full enjoyment of their favourite; they wished to teach him to\r\nwalk and to speak, and they assured me he was making great progress.\r\nThey were beginning to hope his parents had left him entirely, when they\r\ncame in sight, Parabéry bending under the weight of two bear-skins, and\r\na beautiful piece of matting to close the entrance to my grotto; Canda\r\ncarried a basket on her head filled with fine fruit; the cocoa, the\r\nbread-fruit (which they call _rima_), pine-apples, figs, and, finally,\r\na piece of bear’s flesh, roasted at the fire, which I did not like; but\r\nI enjoyed the fruits and the milk of the cocoa-nut, of which Minou-Minou\r\nhad a good share. They spread the bear-skins in the midst of the grotto;\r\nParabéry, Canda, and the infant, between them, took possession of one\r\nwithout ceremony, and motioned to us to make our bed of the other. But\r\nthe bears having only been killed the evening before, these skins had an\r\nintolerable smell. I made them comprehend this, and Parabéry immediately\r\ncarried them off and placed them in the brook, secured by stones. He\r\nbrought us in exchange a heap of moss and leaves, on which we slept\r\nvery well.\r\n\r\n“From this moment we became one family. Canda remained with us, and\r\nrepaid to my daughters all the care and affection they bestowed on\r\nMinou-Minou. There never was a child had more indulgence; but he\r\ndeserved it, for his quickness and docility. At the end of a few months\r\nhe began to lisp a few words of German, as well as his mother, of whom I\r\nwas the teacher, and who made rapid progress. Parabéry was very little\r\nwith us, but he undertook to be our purveyor, and furnished us\r\nabundantly with everything necessary for our subsistence. Canda taught\r\nmy daughter to make beautiful baskets,—some, of a flat form, served for\r\nour plates and dishes. Parabéry made us knives from sharp stones. My\r\ndaughters, in return, taught Canda to sew. At the time of our shipwreck\r\nwe had, each of us, in her pocket, a morocco housewife, with a store of\r\nneedles and thread. By means of these we had mended our linen, and we\r\nnow made dresses of palm-leaves. The bear-skins, washed in the stream,\r\nand thoroughly dried in the burning sun, have been very useful to us in\r\nthe cold and rainy season. Now that we had guides, we made, in the fine\r\nseason, excursions to different parts of the island. Minou-Minou soon\r\nlearned to walk, and being strong, like all these islanders, would\r\nalways accompany us. We went one day to the sea-shore. I shuddered at\r\nthe sight, and Canda, who knew that my husband and child had perished in\r\nthe sea, wept with me. We now spoke each other’s language well enough to\r\nconverse. She told me that a _black friend_ (Emily bowed to Mr. Willis)\r\nhad arrived in a neighbouring island, to announce to them that there was\r\na Being, almighty and all-merciful, who lived in Heaven, and heard all\r\nthey said. Her comprehension of this truth was very confused, and I\r\nendeavoured to make it more clear and positive.\r\n\r\n“‘I see very well,’ said she, ‘that you know him. Is it to Him that you\r\nspeak every morning and evening, kneeling as we do before our king\r\nBara-ourou?’\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, Canda,’ said I, ‘it is before Him who is the King of Kings, who\r\ngave us our life, who preserves it, and bestows on us all good, and who\r\npromises us still more when this life is past.’\r\n\r\n“‘Was it he who charged you to take care of Minou-Minou, and to restore\r\nhim to me?’ asked she.\r\n\r\n“‘Yes, Canda; all that you or I do that is good, is put into our hearts\r\nby Him.’\r\n\r\n“I thus tried to prepare the simple mind of Canda for the great truths\r\nthat Mr. Willis was to teach her.”\r\n\r\n“You left me little to do,” said Mr. Willis. “I found Parabéry and\r\nCanda prepared to believe, with sincere faith, the holy religion I came\r\nto teach—the God of the white people was the only one they adored. I\r\nknew Parabéry, he had come to hunt seals in the island where I was\r\nestablished, and I was struck by his appearance. What was my\r\nastonishment to find, that when I spoke to him of the one true God, he\r\nwas no stranger to the subject. He had even some ideas of a Saviour, and\r\nof future rewards and punishments.\r\n\r\n“‘It was the white lady,’ said he, ‘who taught me this; she teaches\r\nCanda and Minou-minou, whose life she saved, and whom she is bringing up\r\nto be good like herself.’\r\n\r\n“I had a great desire,” continued Mr. Willis, “to become acquainted with\r\nmy powerful assistant in the great work of my mission. I told Parabéry\r\nthis, who offered to bring me here in his canoe; I came and found, in a\r\nmiserable cave, or rather in a bear’s den, all the virtues of mature age\r\nunited to the charms of youth; a resigned and pious mother, bringing up\r\nher children, as women should be brought up, in simplicity, forbearance,\r\nand love of industry; teaching them, as the best knowledge, to love God\r\nwith all their heart, and their neighbour as themselves. Under the\r\ninspection of their mother, they were educating the son of Parabéry.\r\nThis child, then four years and a half old, spoke German well, and knew\r\nhis alphabet, which Madame Hirtel traced on the floor of the grotto; in\r\nthis way she taught her daughters to read; they taught Minou-minou, who,\r\nin his turn, teaches his parents. Parabéry often brings his friends to\r\nthe grotto, and Madame Hirtel, having acquired the language, casts into\r\ntheir hearts the good seed, which I venture to hope will not be\r\nunfruitful.\r\n\r\n“Finding these people in such a good state, and wishing to enjoy the\r\nsociety of a family, like myself, banished to a remote region, I decided\r\nto take up my abode in this island.\r\n\r\n“Parabéry soon built me a hut in the neighbourhood of the grotto; Madame\r\nHirtel compelled me to take one of her bear-skins. I have by degrees\r\nformed my establishment, dividing with my worthy neighbour the few\r\nuseful articles I brought from Europe, and we live a tranquil and\r\nhappy life.\r\n\r\n“And now comes the time that brought about our meeting. Some of our\r\nislanders, in a fishing expedition, were driven by the wind on your\r\nisland. At the entrance of a large bay, they found a small canoe of\r\nbark, carefully moored to a tree. Either their innate propensity for\r\ntheft, or the notion that it had no owner, prevailed over them, and they\r\nbrought it away. I was informed of this, and was curious to see it; I\r\nrecognized at once that it was made by Europeans: the careful finish,\r\nthe neat form, the oars, rudder, mast, and triangular sail, all showed\r\nthat it had not been made by savages. The seats of the rowers were made\r\nof planks, and were painted, and what further convinced me was, that I\r\nfound in it a capital gun, loaded, and a horn of powder in a hole under\r\none of the seats. I then made particular inquiries about the island from\r\nwhence they had brought the canoe; and all their answers confirmed my\r\nidea that it must be inhabited by a European, from whom they had\r\nperhaps taken his only means of leaving it.\r\n\r\n“Restless about this fancy, I tried to persuade them to return and\r\ndiscover if the island was inhabited. I could not prevail on them to\r\nrestore the canoe; but, seeing me much agitated, they resolved secretly\r\nto procure me a great pleasure as they thought, by returning to the\r\nisland and bringing away any one they could meet with, whether he would\r\nor not. Parabéry, always the leader in perilous enterprises, and who was\r\nso attached to me, would not be left out in one which was to produce me\r\nsuch pleasure. They set out, and you know the result of their\r\nexpedition. I leave it to your wife to tell you how she was brought\r\naway, and pass on to the time of their arrival. My people brought them\r\nto me in triumph, and were vexed that they had only found one woman and\r\na child, whom I might give to the white lady. This I did promptly. Your\r\nwife was ill and distressed, and I carried her immediately to the\r\ngrotto. There she found a companion who welcomed her with joy; Francis\r\nreplaced her own lost Alfred, and the two good mothers were soon\r\nintimate friends. But, notwithstanding this solace, your Elizabeth was\r\ninconsolable at the separation from her husband and children, and\r\nterrified at the danger to which you would expose yourself in searching\r\nfor her. We were even afraid she would lose her reason, when the king\r\ncame to take away Francis. He had seen him on his arrival, and was much\r\ntaken with his appearance; he came again to see him, and resolved to\r\nadopt him as his son. You know what passed on this subject; and now you\r\nare once more united to all those who are dear to you.\r\n\r\n“Bless God, brother, who knows how to produce good from what we think\r\nevil, and acknowledge the wisdom of his ways. You must return all\r\ntogether to your island; I am too much interested in the happiness of\r\nEmily to wish to detain her; and if God permits me, when my missions are\r\ncompleted, I will come to end my days with you, and to bless your\r\nrising colony.”\r\n\r\nI suppress all our reflections on this interesting history, and our\r\ngratitude for the termination of our trials, and hasten to the recital,\r\nwhich, at my particular entreaty, my wife proceeded to give us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n“My story,” she began, “will not be long. I might make it in two\r\nwords,—_you have lost me, and you have found me_. I have every reason\r\nto thank Heaven for a circumstance, which has proved to me how dear I am\r\nto you, and has given me the happiness of gaining a friend and two dear\r\ndaughters. Can one complain of an event which has produced such\r\nconsequences, even though it was attended with some violence? But I\r\nought to do the savages justice,—this violence was as gentle as it\r\ncould be. I need only tell you Parabéry was there, to convince you I was\r\nwell treated, and it was solely the sorrow of being parted from you that\r\naffected my health. I shall be well now, and as soon as Jack can walk,\r\nI shall be ready to embark for our happy island. I will now tell you how\r\nI was brought away.\r\n\r\n“When you and our three sons left, to make the tour of the island, I was\r\nvery comfortable; you had told me you might return late, or probably not\r\ntill next day, and when the evening passed away without seeing you, I\r\nwas not uneasy. Francis was constantly with me; we went together to\r\nwater the garden, and rested in the Grotto Ernestine; then I returned to\r\nthe house, took my wheel, and placed myself in my favourite colonnade,\r\nwhere I should be the first to see your return. Francis, seeing me at\r\nwork, asked if he might go as far as the bridge to meet you; to which I\r\nreadily consented. He set out, and I was sitting, thinking of the\r\npleasure I should have in seeing you again, and hearing you relate your\r\nvoyage, when I saw Francis running, crying out, ‘Mamma! mamma! there is\r\na canoe on the sea; I know it is ours; it is full of men,\r\nperhaps savages.’\r\n\r\n“‘Silly little fellow!’ said I, ‘it is your father and brothers; if they\r\nare in the canoe, there can be no doubt of it. Your father told me he\r\nwould bring it, and they would return by water; I had forgotten this\r\nwhen I let you go. Now you can go and meet them on the shore; give me\r\nyour arm, and I will go too,’ and we set off very joyfully to meet our\r\ncaptors. I soon, alas! saw my error; it was, indeed, our canoe, but,\r\ninstead of my dear ones, there were in it six half-naked savages, with\r\nterrible countenances, who landed and surrounded us. My blood froze with\r\nfright, and if I had wished to flee, I was unable. I fell on the shore,\r\nnearly insensible; still, I heard the cries of my dear Francis, who\r\nclung to me, and held me with all his strength; at last my senses quite\r\nfailed me, and I only recovered to find myself lying at the bottom of\r\nthe canoe. My son, weeping over me, was trying to recover me, assisted\r\nby one of the savages, of less repulsive appearance than his companions,\r\nand who seemed the chief; this was Parabéry. He made me swallow a few\r\ndrops of a detestable fermented liquor, which, however, restored me. I\r\nfelt, as I recovered, the extent of my disaster, and your grief, my\r\ndears, when you should find me missing. I should have been wholly\r\ndisconsolate, but that Francis was left to me, and he was continually\r\npraying me to live for his sake. I received some comfort from a vague\r\nnotion that as this was our canoe, the savages had already carried you\r\noff, and were taking us to you.\r\n\r\n“I was confirmed in this hope, when I saw that the savages, instead of\r\nmaking to sea, continued to coast the island, till they came to the\r\nGreat Bay. I had then no doubt but that we should meet with you; but\r\nthis hope was soon destroyed. Two or three more of the savages were\r\nwaiting there on the shore; they spoke to their friends in the canoe;\r\nand I understood from their gestures, that they were saying they could\r\nnot find anybody there. I have since learnt from Canda, that part of\r\nthem landed at the Great Bay, with instructions to search that side of\r\nthe island for inhabitants, whilst the rest proceeded with the canoe to\r\nexamine the other side, and had succeeded but too well. The night came\r\non, and they were anxious to return, which, doubtless, prevented them\r\npillaging our house. I believe, moreover, that none of them could have\r\nreached Tent House, defended by our strong palisade, and hidden by\r\nthe rocks amidst which it is built; and the other party, finding us on\r\nthe shore, would not penetrate further.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “Six savages with terrible countenances, landed and\r\nsurrounded us.”]\r\n\r\n“When all had entered the canoe, they pushed off, by the light of the\r\nstars, into the open sea. I think I must have sunk under my sorrow, but\r\nfor Francis, and, I must confess it, my dear dog Flora, who had never\r\nleft me. Francis told me, that she had tried to defend me, and flew at\r\nthe savages; but one of them took my apron, tore it, and tied it over\r\nher mouth like a muzzle, bound her legs, and then threw her into the\r\ncanoe, where the poor creature lay at my feet, moaning piteously. She\r\narrived with us in this island, but I have not seen her since; I have\r\noften inquired of Parabéry, but he could not tell me what had become\r\nof her.”\r\n\r\n“But I know,” said Fritz, “and have seen her. We brought Turk with us,\r\nand the savages had carried Flora to that desert part of the island,\r\nfrom whence Jack was carried off; so the two dogs met. When I had the\r\nmisfortune to wound Jack, I quite forgot them; they were rambling off,\r\nin chase of kangaroos; we left them, and no doubt they are there still.\r\nBut we must not abandon the poor beasts; if my father will permit me, I\r\nwill go and seek them in Parabéry’s canoe.”\r\n\r\nAs we were obliged to wait a few days for Jack’s recovery, I consented,\r\non condition that Parabéry accompanied them, and the next day was fixed\r\nfor the expedition. Ernest begged to be of the party, that he might see\r\nthe beautiful trees and flowers they had described. I then requested the\r\nnarration might be continued, which had been interrupted by this\r\nepisode of the two dogs. Francis resumed it where his mother had\r\nleft off.\r\n\r\n“We had a favourable passage—the sea was calm, and the boat went so\r\nsmoothly, that both mamma and I went to sleep. You must have come a much\r\nlonger round than necessary, papa, as your voyage lasted three days, and\r\nwe arrived here the day after our departure. Mamma was then awake, and\r\nwept constantly, believing she should never more see you or my brothers.\r\nParabéry seemed very sorry for her, and tried to console her; at last,\r\nhe addressed to her two or three words of German, pointing to heaven.\r\nHis words were very plain—_Almighty God, good_; and then _black\r\nfriend_, and _white lady_; adding the words _Canda, bear_, and\r\n_Minou-minou_. We did not understand what he meant; but he seemed so\r\npleased at speaking these words, that we could not but be pleased too;\r\nand to hear him name God in German gave us confidence, though we could,\r\nnot comprehend where or how he had learnt the words. ‘Perhaps,’ said\r\nmamma, ‘he has seen your papa and brothers,’ I thought so too; still, it\r\nappeared strange that, in so short a time, he could acquire and remember\r\nthese words. However it might be, mamma was delighted to have him near\r\nher, and taught him to pronounce the words _father, mother_, and _son_,\r\nwhich did not seem strange to him, and he soon knew them. She pointed to\r\nme and to herself, as she pronounced the words, and he readily\r\ncomprehended them, and said to us, with bursts of laughter, showing his\r\nlarge ivory teeth, _Canda, mother; Minou-minou, son; Parabéry, father;\r\nwhite lady, mother_. Mamma thought he referred to her, but it was to\r\nMadame Emily. He tried to pronounce this name and two others, but could\r\nnot succeed; at last, he said, _girls, girls_, and almost convinced us\r\nhe must know some Europeans, which was a great comfort to us.\r\n\r\n“When I saw mamma more composed, I took out my flageolet to amuse her,\r\nand played the air to Ernest’s verses. This made her weep again very\r\nmuch, and she begged me to desist; the savages, however, wished me to\r\ncontinue, and I did not know whom to obey. I changed the air, playing\r\nthe merriest I knew. They were in ecstasies; they took me in their arms\r\none after the other, saying, _Bara-ourou, Bara-ourou_. I repeated the\r\nword after them, and they were still more delighted. But mamma was so\r\nuneasy to see me in their arms, that I broke from them, and returned\r\nto her.\r\n\r\n“At last we landed. They carried mamma, who was too weak to walk. About\r\na hundred yards from the shore, we saw a large building of wood and\r\nreeds, before which there was a crowd of savages. One who was very tall\r\ncame to receive us. He was dressed in a short tunic, much ornamented,\r\nand wore a necklace of pierced shells. He was a little disfigured by a\r\nwhite bone passed through his nostrils. But you saw him, papa, when he\r\nwanted to adopt me; it was Bara-ourou, the king of the island. I was\r\npresented to him, and he was pleased with me, touched the end of my nose\r\nwith his, and admired my hair very much. My conductors ordered me to\r\nplay on the flageolet. I played some lively German airs, which made them\r\ndance and leap, till the king fell down with fatigue, and made a sign\r\nfor me to desist. He then spoke for some time to the savages, who stood\r\nin a circle round him. He looked at mamma, who was seated in a corner,\r\nnear her protector Parabéry. He called the latter, who obliged mamma to\r\nrise, and presented her to the king. Bara-ourou looked only at the red\r\nand yellow India handkerchief which she wore on her head; he took it\r\noff, very unceremoniously, and put it on his own head, saying, _miti_,\r\nwhich means beautiful. He then made us re-embark in the canoe with him,\r\namusing himself with me and my flageolet, which he attempted to play by\r\nblowing it through his nose, but did not succeed. After turning round a\r\npoint which seemed to divide the island into two, we landed on a sandy\r\nbeach. Parabéry and another savage proceeded into the interior, carrying\r\nmy mother, and we followed. We arrived at a hut similar to the king’s,\r\nbut not so large. There we were received by Mr. Willis, whom we judged\r\nto be the _black friend_, and from that time we had no more fears. He\r\ntook us under his protection, first speaking to the king and to Parabéry\r\nin their own language. He then addressed mamma in German, mixed with a\r\nfew English words, which we understood very well. He knew nothing of you\r\nand my brothers; but, from what mamma told him, he promised to have you\r\nsought for, and brought as soon as possible to the island. In the mean\r\ntime, he offered to lead us to a friend who would take care of us, and\r\nnurse poor mamma, who looked very ill. She was obliged to be carried to\r\nthe grotto; but, after that, her cares were over, and her pleasure\r\nwithout alloy; for the _black friend_ had promised to seek you. The\r\n_white lady_ received us like old friends, and Sophia and Matilda took\r\nme at first for their own brother, and still love me as if I was. We\r\nonly wished for you all. Madame Mimi made mamma lie down on the\r\nbear-skin, and prepared her a pleasant beverage from the milk of the\r\ncocoa-nut. Sophia and Matilda took me to gather strawberries, and figs,\r\nand beautiful flowers; and we caught fish in the brook, between two\r\nosier hurdles. We amused ourselves very well with Minou-minou, while\r\nCanda and Madame Emily amused mamma.\r\n\r\n“The king came the next day to see his little favourite; he wished me to\r\ngo with him to another part of the island, where he often went to hunt;\r\nbut I would not leave mamma and my new friends. I was wrong, papa; for\r\nyou were there, and my brothers; it was there Jack was wounded and\r\nbrought away. I might have prevented all that, and you would then have\r\nreturned to us. How sorry I have been for my obstinacy! It was I, more\r\nthan Fritz, who was the cause of his being wounded.\r\n\r\n“Bara-ourou returned in the evening to the grotto; and think, papa, of\r\nour surprise, our delight, and our distress, when he brought us poor\r\nJack, wounded and in great pain, but still all joy at finding us again!\r\nThe king told Mr. Willis he was sure Jack was my brother, and he made us\r\na present of him, adding, that he gave him in exchange for mamma’s\r\nhandkerchief. Mamma thanked him earnestly, and placed Jack beside her.\r\nFrom him she learned all you had done to discover us. He informed Mr.\r\nWillis where he had left you, and he promised to seek and bring you to\r\nus. He then examined the wound, which Jack wished him to think he had\r\nhimself caused with Fritz’s gun; but this was not probable, as the ball\r\nhad entered behind, and lodged in the shoulder. Mr. Willis extracted it\r\nwith some difficulty, and poor Jack suffered a good deal; but all is now\r\ngoing on well. What a large party we shall be, papa, when we are all\r\nsettled in our island; Sophia and Matilda, Minou-Minou, Canda, Parabéry,\r\nyou, papa, and two mammas, and Mr. Willis!”\r\n\r\nMy wife smiled as the little orator concluded. Mr. Willis then dressed\r\nJack’s wound, and thought he might be removed in five or six days.\r\n\r\n“Now, my dear Jack,” said I, “it is your turn to relate your history.\r\nYour brother left off where you were entertaining the savages with your\r\nbuffooneries; and certainly they were never better introduced. But how\r\ndid they suddenly think of carrying you away?”\r\n\r\n“Parabéry told me,” said Jack, “that they were struck with my\r\nresemblance to Francis as soon as I took my flageolet. After I had\r\nplayed a minute or two, the savage who wore mamma’s handkerchief, whom I\r\nnow know to be the king, interrupted me by crying out and clapping his\r\nhands. He spoke earnestly to the others, pointing to my face, and to my\r\nflageolet, which he had taken; he looked also at my jacket of blue\r\ncotton, which one of them had tied round his shoulders like a mantle;\r\nand doubtless he then gave orders for me to be carried to the canoe.\r\nThey seized upon me; I screamed like a madman, kicked them and scratched\r\nthem; but what could I do against seven or eight great savages? They\r\ntied my legs together, and my hands behind me, and carried me like a\r\nparcel. I could then do nothing but cry out for Fritz; and the knight of\r\nthe gun came rather too soon. In attempting to defend me, some way or\r\nother, off went his gun, and the ball took up its abode in my shoulder.\r\nI can assure you an unpleasant visitor is that same ball; but here he\r\nis, the scoundrel! Father Willis pulled him out by the same door as that\r\nby which he went in; and since his departure, all goes on well.\r\n\r\n“Now for my story. When poor Fritz saw that I was wounded, he fell\r\ndown as if he had been shot at the same time. The savages, thinking he\r\nwas dead, took away his gun, and carried me into the canoe. I was in\r\ndespair more for the death of my brother than from my wound, which I\r\nalmost forgot, and was wishing they would throw me into the sea, when\r\nI saw Fritz running at full speed to the shore; but we pushed off, and\r\nI could only call out some words of consolation. The savages were very\r\nkind to me, and one of them held me up seated on the out-rigger; they\r\nwashed my wound with sea-water, sucked it, tore my pocket-handkerchief\r\nto make a bandage, and as soon as we landed, squeezed the juice of\r\nsome herb into it. We sailed very quickly, and passed the place where\r\nwe had landed in the morning. I knew it again, and could see Ernest\r\nstanding on a sand-bank; he was watching us, and I held out my arms\r\nto him. I thought I also saw you, papa, and heard you call; but the\r\nsavages yelled, and though I cried with all my strength, it was in\r\nvain. I little thought they were taking me to mamma. As soon as we had\r\ndisembarked, they brought me to this grotto; and I thought I must have\r\ndied of surprise and joy when I was met by mamma and Francis, and then\r\nby Sophia, Matilda, mamma Emily, and Mr. Willis, who is a second father\r\nto me. This is the end of my story. And a very pretty end it is, that\r\nbrings us all together. What matters it to have had a little vexation\r\nfor all this pleasure? I owe it all to you, Fritz; if you had let me\r\nsink to the bottom of the sea, instead of dragging me out by the hair,\r\nI should not have been here so happy as I am; I am obliged to the gun,\r\ntoo; thanks to it, I was the first to reach mamma, and see our new\r\nfriends.”\r\n\r\nThe next day, Fritz and Ernest set out on their expedition with\r\nParabéry, in his canoe, to seek our two valued dogs. The good islander\r\ncarried his canoe on his back to the shore. I saw them set off, but not\r\nwithout some dread, in such a frail bark, into which the water leaked\r\nthrough every seam. But my boys could swim well; and the kind, skilful,\r\nand bold Parabéry undertook to answer for their safety. I therefore\r\nrecommended them to God, and returned to the grotto, to tranquillize my\r\nwife’s fears. Jack was inconsolable that he could not form one of the\r\nparty; but Sophia scolded him for wishing to leave them, to go upon the\r\nsea, which had swallowed up poor Alfred.\r\n\r\nIn the evening we had the pleasure of seeing our brave dogs enter the\r\ngrotto. They leaped on us in a way that terrified the poor little girls\r\nat first, who took them for bears; but they were soon reconciled to them\r\nwhen they saw them fawn round us, lick our hands, and pass from one to\r\nthe other to be caressed. My sons had had no difficulty in finding them;\r\nthey had run to them at the first call, and seemed delighted to see\r\ntheir masters again.\r\n\r\nThe poor animals had subsisted on the remains of the kangaroos, but\r\napparently had met with no fresh water, for they seemed dying with\r\nthirst, and rushed to the brook as soon as they discovered it, and\r\nreturned again and again. Then they followed us to the hut of the good\r\nmissionary, who had been engaged all day in visiting the dwellings of\r\nthe natives, and teaching them the truths of religion. I had accompanied\r\nhim, but, from ignorance of the language, could not aid him. I was,\r\nhowever, delighted with the simple and earnest manner in which he spoke,\r\nand the eagerness with which they heard him. He finished by a prayer,\r\nkneeling, and they all imitated him, lifting up their hands and eyes to\r\nheaven. He told me he was trying to make them celebrate the Sunday. He\r\nassembled them in his tent, which he wished to make a temple for the\r\nworship of the true God. He intended to consecrate it for this purpose,\r\nand to live in the grotto, after our departure.\r\n\r\nThe day arrived at last. Jack’s shoulder was nearly healed, and my\r\nwife, along with her happiness, recovered her strength. The pinnace had\r\nbeen so well guarded by Parabéry and his friends that it suffered no\r\ninjury. I distributed among the islanders everything I had that could\r\nplease them, and made Parabéry invite them to come and see us in our\r\nisland, requesting we might live on friendly terms. Mr. Willis wished\r\nmuch to see it, and to complete our happiness he promised to accompany\r\nand spend some days with us; and Parabéry said he would take him back\r\nwhen he wished it.\r\n\r\nWe embarked, then, after taking leave of Bara-ourou, who was very\r\nliberal in his presents, giving us, besides fruits of every kind, a\r\nwhole hog roasted, which was excellent.\r\n\r\nWe were fourteen in number; sixteen, reckoning the two dogs. The\r\nmissionary accompanied us, and a young islander, whom Parabéry had\r\nprocured to be his servant, as he was too old and too much occupied with\r\nhis mission to attend to his own wants. This youth was of a good\r\ndisposition and much attached to him. Parabéry took him to assist in\r\nrowing when he returned.\r\n\r\nEmily could not but feel rather affected at leaving the grotto, where\r\nshe had passed four tranquil, if not happy years, fulfilling the duties\r\nof a mother. Neither could she avoid a painful sensation when she once\r\nmore saw the sea that had been so fatal to her husband and son; she\r\ncould scarcely subdue the fear she had of trusting all she had left to\r\nthat treacherous element. She held her daughters in her arms, and prayed\r\nfor the protection of Heaven. Mr. Willis and I spoke to her of the\r\ngoodness of God, and pointed out to her the calmness of the water, the\r\nsecurity of the pinnace, and the favourable state of the wind. My wife\r\ndescribed to her our establishment, and promised her a far more\r\nbeautiful grotto than the one she had left, and at last she became more\r\nreconciled.\r\n\r\nAfter seven or eight hours’ voyage, we arrived at Cape Disappointment,\r\nand we agreed the bay should henceforth be called the Bay of the\r\nHappy Return.\r\n\r\nThe distance to Tent House from hence was much too great for the ladies\r\nand children to go on foot. My intention was to take them by water to\r\nthe other end of the island near our house; but my elder sons had\r\nbegged to be landed at the bay, to seek their live stock, and take them\r\nhome. I left them there with Parabéry; Jack recommended his buffalo to\r\nthem, and Francis his bull, and all were found. We coasted the island,\r\narrived at Safety Bay, and were soon at Tent House, where we found all,\r\nas we had left it, in good condition.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the description my wife had given them, our new guests\r\nfound our establishment far beyond their expectation. With what delight\r\nJack and Francis ran up and down the colonnade with their young friends!\r\nWhat stories they had to tell of all the surprises they had prepared for\r\ntheir mother! They showed them _Fritzia, Jackia_, the _Franciade_, and\r\ngave their friends water from their beautiful fountain. Absence seemed\r\nto have improved everything; and I must confess I had some difficulty to\r\nrefrain from demonstrating my joy as wildly as my children. Minou-minou,\r\nParabéry, and Canda, were lost in admiration, calling out continually,\r\n_miti_! beautiful! My wife was busied in arranging a temporary lodging\r\nfor our guests. The work-room was given up to Mr. Willis; my wife and\r\nMadame Emily had our apartment, the two little girls being with them, to\r\nwhom the hammocks of the elder boys were appropriated. Canda, who knew\r\nnothing about beds, was wonderfully comfortable on the carpet. Fritz,\r\nErnest, and the two natives, stowed themselves wherever they wished, in\r\nthe colonnade, or in the kitchen; all was alike to them. I slept on moss\r\nand cotton in Mr. Willis’s room, with my two younger sons. Every one was\r\ncontent, waiting till our ulterior arrangements were completed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI must conclude my journal here. We can scarcely be more happy than we\r\nare, and I feel no cares about my children. Fritz is so fond of the\r\nchase and of mechanics, and Ernest of study, that they will not wish to\r\nmarry; but I please myself by hoping at some time to see my dear Jack\r\nand Francis happily united to Sophia and Matilda. What remains for me to\r\ntell? The details of happiness, however sweet in enjoyment, are often\r\ntedious in recital.\r\n\r\nI will only add, that after passing a few days with us, Mr. Willis\r\nreturned to his charge, promising to visit us, and eventually to join\r\nus. The Grotto Ernestine, fitted up by Fritz and Parabéry, made a pretty\r\nabode for Madame Hirtel and her daughters, and the two islanders.\r\nMinou-minou did not leave his young mammas, and was very useful to them.\r\nI must state, also, that my son Ernest, without abandoning the study of\r\nnatural history, applied himself to astronomy, and mounted the large\r\ntelescope belonging to the ship; he acquired considerable knowledge of\r\nthis sublime science, which his mother, however, considered somewhat\r\nuseless. The course of the other planets did not interest her, so long\r\nas all went on well in that which she inhabited; and nothing now was\r\nwanting to her happiness, surrounded as she was by friends.\r\n\r\nThe following year we had a visit from a Russian vessel, the _Neva_,\r\ncommanded by Captain Krusenstern, a countryman and distant relation of\r\nmine. The celebrated Horner, of Zurich, accompanied him as astronomer.\r\nHaving read the first part of our journal, sent into Europe by Captain\r\nJohnson, he had come purposely to see us. Delighted with our\r\nestablishment, he did not advise us to quit it. Captain Krusenstern\r\ninvited us to take a passage in his vessel; we declined his offer; but\r\nmy wife, though she renounced her country for ever, was glad of the\r\nopportunity of making inquiries about her relations and friends. As she\r\nhad concluded, her good mother had died some years before, blessing her\r\nabsent children. My wife shed some tears, but was consoled by the\r\ncertainty of her mother’s eternal felicity, and the hope of their\r\nmeeting in futurity.\r\n\r\nOne of her brothers was also dead; he had left a daughter, to whom my\r\nwife had always been attached, though she was very young when we left.\r\nHenrietta Bodmer was now sixteen, and, Mr. Horner assured us, a most\r\namiable girl. My wife wished much to have her with us.\r\n\r\nErnest would not leave Mr. Horner a moment, he was so delighted to meet\r\nwith one so eminently skilful in his favourite science. Astronomy made\r\nthem such friends, that Mr. Horner petitioned me to allow him to take my\r\nson to Europe, promising to bring him back himself in a few years. This\r\nwas a great trial to us, but I felt that his taste for science required\r\na larger field than our island. His mother was reluctant to part with\r\nhim, but consoled herself with a notion, that he might bring his cousin\r\nHenrietta back with him.\r\n\r\nMany tears were shed at our parting; indeed, the grief of his mother was\r\nso intense, that my son seemed almost inclined to give up his\r\ninclination; but Mr. Horner made some observations about the transit of\r\nVenus, so interesting that Ernest could not resist. He left us,\r\npromising to bring us back everything we wished for. In the mean time\r\nCaptain Krusenstern left us a good supply of powder, provisions, seeds,\r\nand some capital tools, to the great delight of Fritz and Jack. They\r\nregretted their brother greatly, but diverted their minds from sorrow by\r\napplication to mechanics, assisted by the intelligent Parabéry. They\r\nhave already succeeded in constructing, near the cascade, a corn-mill\r\nand a saw-mill, and have built a very good oven.\r\n\r\nWe miss Ernest very much. Though his taste for study withdrew him a good\r\ndeal from us, and he was not so useful as his brothers, we found his\r\ncalm and considerate advice often of value, and his mildness always\r\nspread a charm over our circle, in joy or in trouble.\r\n\r\nExcept this little affliction, we are very happy. Our labours are\r\ndivided regularly. Fritz and Jack manage the Board of Works. They have\r\nopened a passage through the rock which divided us from the other side\r\nof the island; thus doubling our domain and our riches. At the same\r\ntime, they formed a dwelling for Madame Hirtel near our own, from the\r\nsame excavation in the rock. Fritz took great pains with it; the windows\r\nare made of oiled paper instead of glass; but we usually assemble in our\r\nlarge work-room, which is very well lighted.\r\n\r\nFrancis has the charge of our flocks and of the poultry, all greatly\r\nincreased. For me, I preside over the grand work of agriculture. The two\r\nmothers, their two daughters, and Canda, manage the garden, spin,\r\nweave, take care of our clothes, and attend to household matters. Thus\r\nwe all work, and everything prospers. Several families of the natives,\r\npupils of Mr. Willis, have obtained leave, through him, to join us, and\r\nare settled at Falcon’s Nest, and at the Farm. These people assist us in\r\nthe cultivation of our ground, and our dear missionary in the\r\ncultivation of our souls. Nothing is wanting to complete our happiness\r\nbut the return of dear Ernest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSTSCRIPT TWO YEARS AFTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are now as happy as we can desire,—our son is returned. According to\r\nmy wishes, he had made out Captain Johnson and Lieutenant Bell, our\r\nfirst visitors, whom the storm had driven from us, but who were still\r\ndetermined to see us again. My son found them preparing for another\r\nvoyage to the South Seas. He at once seized the opportunity of\r\naccompanying them, impatiently desirous to revisit the island, and to\r\nbring to us Henrietta Bodmer, now become his wife. She is a simple,\r\namiable Swiss girl, who suits us well, and who is delighted to see once\r\nmore her kind aunt, now become her mother.\r\n\r\nMy wife is overjoyed; this is her first daughter-in-law, but Jack and\r\nFrancis, as well as Sophia and Matilda, are growing up; and moreover, my\r\ndear wife, who has great ideas of married happiness, hopes to induce\r\nEmily to consent to be united to Fritz at the same time as her daughters\r\nare married. Fritz would feel all the value of this change; his\r\ncharacter is already softened by her society, and though she is a few\r\nyears older than he is, she is blessed with all the vivacity of youth.\r\nMr. Willis approves of this union, and we hope he will live to solemnize\r\nthe three marriages. Ernest and Henrietta inhabit the Grotto Ernestine,\r\nwhich his brothers fitted up as a very tasteful dwelling. They had even,\r\nto gratify their brother, raised on the rock above the grotto a sort of\r\nobservatory, where the telescope is mounted, to enable him to make his\r\nastronomical observations. Yet I perceive his passion for exploring\r\ndistant planets is less strong, since he has so much to attach him\r\nto this.\r\n\r\nI give this conclusion of my journal to Captain Johnson, to take into\r\nEurope, to be added to the former part. If any one of my readers be\r\nanxious for further particulars respecting our colony and our mode of\r\nlife, let him set out for the Happy Island; he will be warmly welcomed,\r\nand may join with us in Ernest’s chorus, which we now sing with\r\nadditional pleasure,—\r\n\r\n     All we love around us smile,\r\n     Joyful is our Desert Isle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER, 1850.\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS\r\nPRESENTS AND GIFT-BOOKS,\r\nIN NEW AND ELEGANT BINDINGS,\r\nPUBLISHED OR SOLD BY\r\nGEORGE ROTJTLEDGE AND CO.,\r\n36, SOHO SQUARE, LONDON.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEdited by the Rev.
