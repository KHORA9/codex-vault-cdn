BOUCHERIE._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most usual drink in the United States, is whiskey; other spirituous\r\nliquors, such as peach and apple brandy, are only secondary, and from\r\ntheir high price and their scarcity, they are not sufficient for the\r\nwants of an already immense and increasing population. As to wine, in\r\nspite of all the efforts and repeated trials made to propagate the\r\ngrape-vine, there is as yet no hopes, that it may in time become the\r\nprincipal drink of the Americans.\r\n\r\nTo turn our enquiries towards the means of bringing the art of making\r\nwhiskey to greater perfection, is therefore, to contribute to the\r\nwelfare of the United States, and even to the health of the Americans,\r\nand to the prosperity of the distiller, as I will prove in the sequel.\r\n\r\nThe arts and sciences have made great progress; my aim is to diffuse new\r\nlight on every thing that relates to the formation of spirituous liquors\r\nthat may be obtained from grains. Most arts and trades are practised\r\nwithout principles, perhaps from the want of the means of information.\r\nFor the advantage of the distillers of whiskey, I will collect and offer\r\nthem the means of obtaining from a given quantity of grain, the greatest\r\npossible quantity of spirit, purer and cheaper than by the usual\r\nmethods. I shall then proceed to indicate the methods of converting\r\nwhiskey into gin, according to the process of the Holland Distillers,\r\nwithout heightening its price.\r\n\r\nIf the principles hereafter developed are followed, the trade of\r\ndistiller will acquire great advantages, that will spread their\r\ninfluence on agriculture, and consequently on commerce in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ART OF MAKING WHISKEY, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nOF SPIRITUOUS LIQUORS, OR SPIRITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpirituous liquors are the produce of vinous ones, obtained by the\r\ndistillation of these last. The art of making wine is of the remotest\r\nantiquity, since it is attributed to Noah; but that of distilling it, so\r\nas to extract its most spirituous part, dates only from the year 1300.\r\nArnand de Villeneuve was the inventor of it, and the produce of his\r\nStill appeared so marvellous, that it was named Aqua-Vitæ, or _Water of\r\nLife_, and has ever since continued under that denomination in France;\r\nVoltaire and reason say that it might, with far more propriety, be\r\ncalled _Aqua-Mortis_, or Water of Death.\r\n\r\nThis liquor, called in English, _Brandy_, received from the learned the\r\nname of _Spirit of Wine_; time improved the art of making it still\r\nstronger by concentration, and in that state it is called _Alcohol_.\r\n\r\nAll spirit is the distilled result of a wine, either of grapes, other\r\nfruits, or grains; it is therefore necessary to have either wine, or any\r\nvinous liquor, in order to obtain spirits.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nOF THE FORMATION OF VINOUS LIQUORS WITH GRAINS, IN ORDER TO MAKE\r\nSPIRITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe art of extracting wine from the juice of the grape, not being the\r\nobject of this book, I shall confine myself to what is necessary and\r\nuseful to the distillers of whiskey; it is therefore of the vinous\r\nliquor extracted from grains, that I am going to speak.\r\n\r\nThe formation of that kind of liquor is founded upon a faculty peculiar\r\nto grains, which the learned chymist, Fourcroy, has called _saccharine\r\nfermentation_. Sugar itself does not exist in gramineous substances;\r\nthey only contain its elements, or first principles, which produce it.\r\nThe saccharine fermentation converts those elements into sugar, or at\r\nleast into a saccharine matter; and when this is developed, it yields\r\nthe eminent principle of fermentation, without which there exists no\r\nwine, and consequently no spirit.\r\n\r\nGrains yield two kinds of vinous liquors, of which the distiller makes\r\nspirit, and the brewer a sort of wine, called _beer_. From a comparison\r\nof the processes employed to obtain these two results, it will be found\r\nthat the brewer's art has attained a higher degree of perfection than\r\nthat of the distiller. They both have for their object to obtain a\r\nvinous liquor; but that of the brewer is, in reality, a sort of wine to\r\nwhich he gives, at pleasure, different degrees of strength; while that\r\nof the distiller is scarcely vinous, and cannot be made richer. I will\r\ngive a succinct exposition of their two processes in order that they may\r\nbe compared.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE ART OF BREWING.\r\n\r\nThe art of brewing consists:\r\n\r\n1st. In the sprouting of a proportion of grain, chiefly barley. This\r\noperation converts into a saccharine matter, the elements of that same\r\nsubstance already existing in grains.\r\n\r\n2dly. In preparing the _wort_. For that operation, the grain, having\r\nbeen previously ground, is put into a vat, which is half filled up with\r\nwater; the rest is filled up at three different times with hot\r\nwater--the first at 100°, the second at 150°, and the third at 212°,\r\nwhich is boiling water. The mixture is strongly stirred each time that\r\nit is immersed. By this infusion, the water lays hold of the sweet\r\nprinciples contained in the grain.\r\n\r\n3dly. The wort thus prepared, the liquor is filtrated, in order to\r\nseparate it from the grain, and then boiled until reduced to one half,\r\nin order to concentrate it to the degree of strength desired. In that\r\nstate, 40 gallons of wort contain the saccharine principles of 200 wt.\r\nof grain.\r\n\r\n4thly. The wort, thus concentrated, is drawn off in barrels, which are\r\nkept in a temperature of 80° or 85°. The yeast is thrown into it to\r\nestablish the fermentation, and in a short time beer is made, more or\r\nless strong, according to the degree of concentration, and more or less\r\nbitter, according to the greater or lesser proportion of hops put into\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSuch are, in a concise view, the proceedings of the brewer. Let us\r\nproceed to those of the distiller of whiskey.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE DISTILLER OF WHISKEY.\r\n\r\nWhiskey is made either with rye, barley, or Indian corn. One, or all\r\nthose kinds of grains is used, as they are more or less abundant in the\r\ncountry. I do not know how far they are mixed in Kentucky; but Indian\r\ncorn is here in general the basis of whiskey, and more often employed\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nI have ascertained, in the different distilleries which I have visited\r\nin the United States--\r\n\r\n1stly. That, in general, the grain is not sprouted. I have, however,\r\nseen some distillers who put 10lbs. of malt into a hogshead of\r\nfermentation containing 100 gallons, which reduces it to almost nothing.\r\n\r\n2dly. That they put two bushels of ground grain into a hogshead of\r\nfermentation containing 100 gallons, filled up with water.\r\n\r\n3dly. They had a ferment to determine the fermentation, which, when\r\nfinished, yields two gallons of whiskey per bushel of grain, and\r\nsometimes ten quarts, but very seldom. I do not know whether those\r\nresults are exact; but, supposing them to be so, they must be subject to\r\ngreat variations, according to the quality of the grain, the season, the\r\ndegree of heat, of the atmosphere, and the manner of conducting the\r\nfermentation. From my analysing the different sorts of grains, I know\r\nthat Indian corn must yield the most spirit.\r\n\r\nFrom the above proportions, it results, that 100 gallons of the vinous\r\nliquor of distillers yield only 4 gallons of whiskey, and very seldom 5;\r\nthat is, from a 25th to a 20th. It is easy to conceive how weak a\r\nmixture, 25 parts of water to one of whiskey, must be; thus the produce\r\nof the first distillation is only at 11° or 12° by the areometer, the\r\nwater being at 10°. It is only by several subsequent distillations, that\r\nthe necessary concentration is obtained, to make saleable whiskey. These\r\nrepeated operations are attended with an increased expense of fuel,\r\nlabor, and time.\r\n\r\nSuch are the usual methods of the whiskey distillers. Before we compare\r\nthem with those of the brewer, let us examine the nature of\r\nfermentation, and what are the elements the most proper to form a good\r\nvinous liquor: thence we shall judge with certainty, of those two ways\r\nof operating.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nOF FERMENTATION.\r\n\r\n     \"Fermentation is a spontaneous and intestine motion, which takes\r\n     place amongst the principles of organic substance deprived of life,\r\n     the maximum of which always tends to change the nature of bodies,\r\n     and gives rise to the formation of new productions.\"\r\n\r\n     _Bouillon la Grange.--Manual of a Course of Chymistry._\r\n\r\n\r\nFermentation has long since been divided into _spirituous_, _acid_, and\r\n_putrid_.\r\n\r\nIt is only since the revival or new epoch of chymistry, that the learned\r\nhave been occupied in researches on fermentation. I was the first who\r\ngave a new hint on this important part of natural philosophy, in 1785.\r\nIt was then held as certain, that the saccharine substance was the\r\nprinciple of spirituous fermentation. A series of experiments enabled me\r\nto demonstrate the contrary, for I obtained a well crystallized sugar by\r\nthe fermentation of a substance which produces none by any other means.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1785, I read a memoir to the Academy of Sciences, at\r\nParis. In that memoir I developed my theory. That learned body nominated\r\nfour commissioners, for the purpose of examining my operations, and\r\nsanctioned my discovery by a report, in which it was acknowledged that\r\nI had discovered a new truth, and ordered the insertion of my memoir in\r\nthe collection of those of the Foreign Associates. I attributed the\r\nprinciple of the spirituous fermentation to the mucilaginous substance.\r\nThis has been since demonstrated, by attentively observing that it\r\nalways begins with a motion of acid fermentation, which is produced by\r\nthe mucilaginous substance. The European chymists have since reasoned\r\nupon fermentation; each of them has produced a new system; none have\r\nbeen able to bring it to a regular demonstration; and the learned Gay\r\nLussac has said, that fermentation is one of the most mysterious\r\noperations of chymistry. Be that as it may, there are facts that are\r\nascertained: let us endeavor to investigate them, that we may derive\r\nfrom them all the information which is necessary to us.\r\n\r\nIt is incontestable that spirits are produced by the saccharine\r\nsubstance. Grains, however, supply it, although they are not sensibly\r\nsweet. This has made me suspect that the fermentation is at first\r\nsaccharine, which produces the sweet substance that is necessary for the\r\nformation of spirit. It is thus that, by a series of internal motions,\r\nthe fermentation causes the formation of the spirit to be preceded by a\r\nslight production of acid; that it transforms the vinous liquor into\r\nvinegar, which the same fermentation changes in time into an animal\r\nsubstance, destroyed in its turn by the putrid fermentation. Such are\r\nthe progressive changes operated by this all-disorganizing phenomenon,\r\nand the unerring march of nature to bring back all substances to their\r\nrespective elements.\r\n\r\nThe necessary conditions for the formation of vinous fermentation, are--\r\n\r\n1st. The presence of the saccharine substance.\r\n\r\n2dly. That of a vegeto-animal substance, commonly called ferment, and\r\nsoluble in water.\r\n\r\n3dly. A certain quantity of water.\r\n\r\n4thly. A temperature of 70° to 75°.\r\n\r\n5thly. A sufficient mass.\r\n\r\nWhen these are obtained, in a short time the liquor becomes turbid; it\r\nbubbles, from the disengaging of the carbonic acid gaz, and the heat\r\nincreases considerably. After some days, these impetuous motions\r\nsubside; the fermentation ceases by degrees; the liquor clears up; then\r\nit emits a vinous smell and taste. As soon as it ferments no more, it\r\nmust be distilled. However, some distillers have asserted that a greater\r\nquantity of spirit is obtained when the liquor has acquired a certain\r\ndegree of acidity. Others are of opinion that it must be distilled as\r\nsoon as it is calm. I am of this opinion, because the acid can only be\r\nformed at the expense of a little of the spirit, which is one of the\r\nprinciples of the acetous acid. Besides, the longer the liquor remains\r\nin a mass, the more spirit is wasted by evaporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nOF THE PROPORTIONS OF THE ELEMENTS NECESSARY TO FORM A GOOD VINOUS\r\nLIQUOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat are the proportions of the elements necessary to form a good vinous\r\nliquor?\r\n\r\nWe owe the important knowledge of those proportions to the celebrated\r\nand unfortunate Lavoisier, who has proved, by the most accurate\r\nexperiments, that there must be\r\n\r\n100 parts of dry sweet substance, or sugar\r\n400 parts of water\r\n 10 parts of ferment, or liquid yeast, which is reduced\r\n---       to 8 7-10ths of dry matter.\r\n\r\n510 parts in the whole, which produce 57 parts of dry alcohol; that is,\r\ncontaining no more water than is necessary to its formation, and\r\nconsequently as strong as it can be. Let us dwell for a moment upon the\r\nproportions just pointed out, and especially upon their result, which\r\nexceeds any thing that has ever been obtained. Supposing the weight of\r\neach of those parts to be one pound, we shall have\r\n\r\n100 lbs. of dry sweet Substance, or sugar\r\n400 do. of water\r\n 10 do. of liquid ferment\r\n---\r\n510 pounds in the whole.\r\n\r\n100lbs. of sugar is the quantity required to make 12-1/2\r\n    gallons of sirup, composed of 8lbs. of sugar and 8lbs. of\r\n    water per gallon,                        12-1/2 galls.\r\n400lbs. of water, at 8lbs. per gall. make 50           \"\r\nThe produce will be 57lbs. of dry alcohol.\r\n\r\nA vessel containing one ounce of water, filled up with this alcohol,\r\nweighs only 16dwts. and 16grs. From this report, it appears that the\r\nspecific weight of the alcohol is, to the weight of the water, as 20 to\r\n24; that is, that water weighs 1/5 more than alcohol. If the 57lbs. thus\r\nobtained were only water, it would only represent 7-1/8* gallons; but\r\nbeing alcohol, it weighs 1/6* less, and consequently gives 7-1/8 gallons\r\nmore, the sixth of this quantity, (to wit:) 1-1/6* gallons, which, added\r\nto 7-1/8*, make 8-7/24 gallons.\r\n\r\n[TR: Poor quality made it difficult to verify the above numbers and so\r\nnoted with an asterisk]\r\n\r\nBut 1 gallon of dry alcohol, extended in 2 gallons of water, gives 3\r\ngallons of liquor at 19°, which is called Holland, or first proof; a\r\nproduce surpassing all what has been hitherto known to the distillers. I\r\nwill prove it by an example: 1 gallon of molasses yields only 1 gallon\r\nof rum, at 19°, to the rum distiller; still, molasses is a true sirup,\r\ncomposed of 8lbs. of sugar, or sweet matter, more fermentable than\r\nsugar. 12-1/2 gallons of molasses, representing 100lbs. of dry sweet\r\nmatter yield consequently 12-1/2 galls. of rum, Holland proof, which is\r\nonly half the produce obtained by Lavoisier; an immense difference\r\ncapable of exciting the emulation of all distillers, as it proves the\r\nimperfection of the art.\r\n\r\nWhat are the causes of such a dissimilarity of product? We must seek for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n1st. In the difference of the strength of the vinous liquor. Lavoisier\r\nemployed only 4 parts of water to 1 part of dry sugar. The rum distiller\r\nusually puts 10 gallons of molasses to 90 gallons of water, or the\r\nresidue of the preceding distillations.\r\n\r\n10 galls. molasses contain\r\n80 lbs. of sweet matter.\r\n\r\n90 gallons of water weigh 720lbs.; therefore the proportion is, one part\r\nof sweet matter to 9 parts of water--whilst that indicated by Lavoisier\r\nis only 4 parts of water to 1 part of sugar.[A]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious how much richer this last must be, and that the\r\nfermentation thus produced has an energy far superior to the other.\r\nThence results a rapid production of spirit, operated in a short time;\r\nwhilst that of the rum distiller languishes more or less, and a slow\r\nfermentation wastes part of the spirit which it produces, even as it is\r\nforming.\r\n\r\n2dly. Bodies evaporate in proportion to the extent of their surface. One\r\nhogshead of 100 gallons, should contain, according to Lavoisier's\r\ncomposition, the elements of 50 gallons of spirit, at 19°; whilst that\r\nof the rum distiller contains only 12. Now, as every fermentable liquor\r\nrequires open vessels, the hogshead of the rum distiller loses as much\r\nspirit as that of Lavoisier: hence it is plain how far the above\r\nproportion operates to the disadvantage of the fermer.\r\n\r\n3dly. Another source of loss arises in the distilling vessels\r\nthemselves. Nothing is more imperfect than the stills of a whiskey\r\ndistillery. Lavoisier's were so perfect, that he made the analysis and\r\nthe synthesis in the most delicate operations [B]. The vessels of the\r\nwhiskey distillers, far from being hermetically closed, allow the spirit\r\nto evaporate through every joint. And this is not all: corroded by the\r\nacetous acid, they are full of small holes, particularly in the cap,\r\nwhere all the vapors collect themselves, as in a reservoir. It is easy\r\nto conceive with what rapidity they escape, which occasions a\r\nconsiderable waste of liquor. In proof of the truth of this observation,\r\nwe may refer to the smell of whiskey, so strongly perceivable on the\r\nroads leading to a distillery, and preceeding from no other cause than\r\nthat liquor wasting out of bad vessels, to the great loss of the\r\ndistiller.\r\n\r\n4thly. A fourth cause of loss arises from the worm of the still. However\r\ncareful in keeping the surrounding water cool, there is always one\r\nportion of vapor not condensed. This is made more sensible in the\r\nwinter, when the cold of the atmosphere makes every vapor visible; upon\r\nexamination, it will be seen that the running stream of liquor is\r\nsurrounded with it. In my description of my apparatus, I give the means\r\nof obviating that evil.\r\n\r\nTo these several causes, may we not add another? May not the production\r\nof spirit be in a ratio to the richness of the fermenting liquor? It is\r\ncertain, that in every spirituous fermentation there is a portion of the\r\nsweet matter which remains undecomposed and in its original state.\r\nLavoisier found that it was 4.940; that is, nearly 5 parts in 100. It\r\nmay possibly be the same in a weaker liquor; which would increase the\r\nloss, in the inverse ratio of the density of the liquor. Such are the\r\ncauses to which I attribute the great superiority of Lavoisier's\r\nproducts; and from those observations I thought I could establish the\r\nfabrication of whiskey upon new principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nA COMPARISON OF THE PROCESSES OF THE BREWER WITH THOSE OF THE WHISKEY\r\nDISTILLER.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the experiments of one of the most learned chymists of Europe, it\r\nhas been demonstrated, that the proportions the most advantageous to the\r\nformation of a good vinous liquor, are, one part of dry sweet substance\r\nto four parts of water; that is, that the sugar must form one fifth of\r\nthe whole. We have, moreover, seen that 100lbs. of dry sweet matter gave\r\n25 gallons of spirit 19°, which comes to 4lbs. of sugar per gallon.\r\n\r\nWe shall make use of that scale in comparing the processes of the brewer\r\nwith those of the whiskey distiller.\r\n\r\nSupposing the bushel of grain to weigh 50 pounds, and that it gives 2\r\ngallons of whiskey at 19°, each of which gallons is the product of 4lbs.\r\nof sugar; then the strong beer which contains in 40 gallons the sweet\r\nmatter of 200lbs. of grain, contains the elements of 8 gallons of\r\nspirit, or 32lbs. of dry sweet substance; and as the 40 gallons of this\r\nbeer weigh 320lbs. the 32lbs. of sugar form only one-tenth of it, which\r\nis one half of Lavoisier's proportions.\r\n\r\nThose of the distiller of whiskey are 100lbs. of grain to 100 gallons of\r\nwater, or thereabouts: 100lbs. of grain contain only 16lbs. of dry sweet\r\nmatter: therefore, as the 100 gallons of vinous liquor weigh 800lbs. the\r\n16lbs. of sugar form only its fiftieth part.\r\n\r\nThence is seen how inferior the proportions of the whiskey distiller are\r\nto those of the brewer, and how far they are from good theory. But the\r\nbrewer aims only at producing a sort of wine, and succeeds; while, the\r\ndistiller wants to make spirit, and only obtains it in the manner the\r\nmost expensive, and opposed to his own interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nDEFECTS IN THE USUAL METHOD OF MAKING WHISKEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n1st. The most hurtful of all for the interests of the distillers, is\r\nundoubtedly the weakness of the vinous liquor. We have seen that the\r\nproportion of spirit is in a ratio to the richness of the fermenting\r\nliquor; that Lavoisier, by putting one-fifth of the mass of dry sugar,\r\nobtained twice as much spirit as the rum distiller, who puts in the same\r\nquantity, but drowns it in water. From those principles, which are not\r\ncontested, the distiller, whose vinous liquor contains only one-fiftieth\r\npart of sweet matter, obtains the less spirit, and loses as much of it\r\nas he gets.\r\n\r\n2dly. Another defect is joined to this: bodies are dissolved by reason\r\nof their affinity with the dissolving principle; the mucilaginous\r\nsubstance is as soluble in water as the saccharine substance. A mass of\r\n100 gallons of water having only 16lbs. of sugar to dissolve, exerts\r\nit's dissolving powers upon the mucilaginous part which abounds in\r\ngrains, and dissolves a great quantity of it. There results from that\r\nmixture, a fermentation partaking of the spirit and the acid, and if the\r\ntemperature of the atmosphere is moderate, the acid invades the spirit,\r\nwhich is one of its principles: nothing remains but vinegar, and the\r\nhopes of the distiller are deceived.\r\n\r\nSome distillers have been induced, by the smallness of their products,\r\nto put in their stills, not only the fluid of the liquor, but the flour\r\nitself. Hence result two important defects. 1st. The solid matter\r\nprecipitates itself to the bottom of the still, where it burns, and\r\ngives a very bad taste to the whiskey. In order to remedy this\r\ninconvenience, it has been imagined to stir the flour incessantly, by\r\nmeans of a chain dragged at the bottom of the still, and put in motion\r\nby an axis passing through the cap, and turned by a workman until the\r\nebullition takes place. This axis, however well fitted to the aperture,\r\nleaves an empty space, and gives an issue to the spirituous vapors,\r\nwhich escaping with rapidity, thereby occasion a considerable loss of\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n3dly. The presence of the grain in the still, converted into meal, is\r\nnot otherwise indifferent. It contains a kind of essential oil, more or\r\nless disagreeable, according to its nature; which distils\r\nwith the spirit. That of Indian corn, in particular, is more noxious\r\nthan that of any other grain; and it is the presence of meal in the\r\nstills, which causes the liquors obtained from grains to be so much\r\ninferior to that of fruits.\r\n\r\n4thly. There is a fourth defect, at which humanity shudders, and which\r\nthe laws ought to repress. Vinous liquors are more or less accompanied\r\nwith acetone acid, or vinegar; but those proceeding from grain contain\r\nstill more of this acid. The stills are generally made of naked copper;\r\nthe acid works upon that metal, and forms with it the _acetate of\r\ncopper_, or verdigrise, part of which passes with the whiskey. There is\r\nno distiller, who, with a little attention, has not observed it. I have\r\nalways discovered it in my numerous rectifications, and at the end of\r\nthe operation, when nothing more comes from the still but what is called\r\nthe sweet oil of wine. An incontestable proof of this truth is, that as\r\nthe stills of the distillers are of a green color in their interior\r\npart; that they are corroded with the acid, and pierced with numberless\r\nlittle holes, which render them unfit for use in a very short time. It\r\nis easy to conceive how hurtful must be the presence of verdigrise to\r\nthose who make use of whiskey as a constant drink: even those who use it\r\nsoberly, swallow a slow poison, destructive of their stomach; while to\r\nthose who abuse it, it produces a rapid death, which would still be the\r\nconsequence of abuse, if the liquor was pure, but is doubly accelerated\r\nby the poison contained in the whiskey. It is easy to remedy so terrible\r\nan evil. The acetous acid has no action upon tin. By tinning the stills,\r\nthe purity of the liquor will be augmented, and the distilling vessels,\r\nalready so expensive, will be longer preserved. This operation must be\r\nrenewed every year. The worms must likewise be tinned, if they are\r\ncopper; but they are better of tin, or of the purest pewter.\r\n\r\nSuch are the defects of the present method of distilling whiskey. Having\r\nexposed them, I must present the means of bringing to perfection the\r\nfabrication of a liquor of such general use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS THE MOST ADVANTAGEOUS TO MAKE WHISKEY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[TR: The next two paragraphs were cut short, however attempted\r\nre-constructed for clarity]\r\n\r\nAs it is demonstrated that the spirit is the more abundant in proportion\r\nto the richness of the vinous liquor,* it is therefore necessary to\r\nenrich that of the distillery* which is so deficient in that respect. An\r\nexposition of* my processes will point out the means I employ to attain*\r\nthat end. A large whiskey distillery should be* able to make 100 gallons\r\nper day, or three barrels* making altogether that quantity.\r\n\r\nOne gallon of spirit being the produce of 4 pounds* of dry saccharine\r\nmatter, we must therefore have 400 pounds of this substance for the 100\r\ngallons we wish to obtain.\r\n\r\nIf 1 bushel of grain gives 2 gallons of whiskey, there must be 50 to\r\nobtain a daily result of 100 gallons. I take Indian corn as the basis\r\nof the fabrication, as that of all the grains which yields the most.\r\nFor, from my method, whatever grain is employed, the spirit is equally\r\npure.\r\n\r\nI divide the still house into three different rooms, to wit:\r\n\r\nOne for Infusion;\r\n\r\nOne for Fermentation;\r\n\r\nOne for Distillation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE ROOM OF INFUSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is here that the liquor destined to make whiskey, should be prepared,\r\nand made rich enough to procure a good fermentation. To this effect,\r\nthere must be a mill with a vertical stone, moved by a horse, or any\r\nother means of motion. Those mills are too well known for me to describe\r\nthem more amply. The corn must be coarsely ground, so as scarcely to be\r\nbroke into three or four pieces: consequently the stone must not be too\r\nheavy, for, at all events, the grain had better be too coarse than too\r\nfine. That mill should be placed in the infusion room, so as not to keep\r\nit dirty, nor to be too much in the way. It must grind, or rather break,\r\n50 bushels per day.\r\n\r\nThere must be a square kettle, 4 feet broad, 5 feet long, 1 foot deep.\r\nThe kettle must be made in sheets of copper, one line thick, at least:\r\nthe bottom, although flat, should have a slight swell inside, so as to\r\navoid the expansion of the metal outside, from the action of the fire.\r\nThis kettle must be placed upon a brick furnace, so that the longest\r\nparts should bear forwards, and the other against the chimney, from\r\nwhich it must be separated by a brick wall eight or nine inches. The\r\nsides, around which there must be a space to walk freely, should be\r\nsupported by a wall 1-1/2 feet deep; the fore part upon such a wall, in\r\nthe middle of which is an iron door, fifteen inches square, in an iron\r\nframe, through which the fuel is introduced.\r\n\r\nThe kettle is mounted upon the furnace, so as to bear upon the four\r\nwalls about 4 inches, and rests upon a bed of clay, which must leave no\r\npassage to the action of the fire; it is lined externally with bricks,\r\nand must have a pipe on one of its sides, to draw off the liquor.\r\n\r\nUnder the kettle, 15 inches from the bottom, is a flue for the heat,\r\nrunning through all its length. It is 2-1/2 feet wide at bottom,\r\nextending like a fan at the top, about 6 inches on each side, so that\r\nthe flame may circulate in all the breadth of the kettle.\r\n\r\nOn the fore part of this flue, facing the door, is a hearth, occupying\r\nall its breadth, and 2 feet long. The rest of the flue is paved with\r\nbricks, and rises insensibly 4 inches towards the chimney, in which it\r\nopens by two holes, 1-1/2 inches wide, 8 or 9 inches high.\r\n\r\nImmediately under the hearth, is a mash hole 4 feet deep, occupying all\r\nits capacity, and projecting 2 feet forward. This opening is necessary\r\nto keep up a free circulation of air, and to take up the ashes. It\r\nshould be covered with strong boards, not to hinder the service of the\r\nkettle. The hearth is made with an iron grate, more or less close,\r\naccording to the nature of the fuel; if for wood, the bars must be about\r\ntwo inches apart; if for coals, half an inch is sufficient. The furnace\r\nmust be built with care. The parts most exposed to the action of the\r\nfire must be built with soft bricks and potters' clay: soap stone would\r\nbe preferable, if easy to procure. The brick separating the kettle and\r\nchimney, must be supported with flat bars of iron, as well as the part\r\nover the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nUSE OF THE KETTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe kettle is destined to make the infusion of the grain, and boil it so\r\nas to convert it into wort. By that operation I make the liquor richer,\r\nwhich I intend for fermentation, and bring it to divers degrees of\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\nI put into the kettle 100 gallons of water, and 4 bushels of corn,\r\nbroken, as I said before, at the mill. I light a small fire, which I\r\nincrease gradually, until the water begins to boil; during that time,\r\nthe grain is stirred with a paddle. As soon as the ebullition is\r\nestablished, the grain is taken up with a large skimmer, and put to\r\ndrain into a large basket hanging over the kettle; and when the grain\r\nhas been totally taken up, the fire is increased so as to bring the\r\nwater to boil again, until reduced to two-fifths, which degree of\r\nconcentration is not rigorous, and the distiller may augment it as his\r\nexperience shall direct. When thus concentrated, the liquor is drawn off\r\nthrough the pipe, and received into a tub or vat containing 130 or 140\r\ngalls.\r\n\r\n100 gallons more of water are put into the kettle, with 4 bushels of\r\ncorn; the fire conducted slowly, as before, until the degree of\r\nebullition; the corn is taken off, and the liquor concentrated in the\r\nsame proportions; then drawn off as above, in the same tub.\r\n\r\nThe same operation is repeated for the third time; the three united\r\nliquors are slightly stirred, and, still warm, transported into one of\r\nthe hogsheads of fermentation, which it nearly fills up.\r\n\r\nAs there must be four of these hogsheads filled up daily, the work at\r\nthe kettle must be kept going on, without interruption, until that\r\nquantity is obtained, which may be done in about twelve hours. The grain\r\nwhich has been drained is carried to dry, either in the open air, or in\r\na granary, and spread thin. When dry, it is excellent food for cattle,\r\nand highly preferable to the acid and fermented mash, usually used by\r\ndistillers to feed cattle and hogs: they eat the corn dried in the above\r\nmanner as if it had lost nothing of its primitive qualities and flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE ROOM FOR FERMENTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe room destined to the fermentation must be close, lighted by two or\r\nthree windows, and large enough to contain a number of hogsheads\r\nsufficient for the distillery. It may be determined by the number of\r\ndays necessary for the fermentation; 30 or 40 hogsheads may suffice,\r\neach of 120 or 130 gallons.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the room must be a stove, large enough to keep up a\r\nheat of 75° to 80°, even in winter. A thermometer placed at one end of\r\nthe room, serves to regulate the heat.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the liquor is in the hogshead, the yeast, or fermenting\r\nprinciple, is put into it, stirred for some moments, and then left to\r\nitself. A liquor as rich as the above described ferments with force, and\r\nruns with rapidity through all the periods of fermentation. It is fit to\r\ndistil as soon as that tumultuous state has subsided and\r\nthe liquor is calm.\r\n\r\nThe essential character of the spirituous fermentation, is to exhale the\r\ncarbonic acid gaz in great quantity. This gaz is mortal to mankind, and\r\nto all the living creation. Thirty hogsheads of fermenting liquor\r\nproducing a great deal of this gaz, the room should be purified of it by\r\nopening two opposite windows several times a day. This is the more\r\nessential, as the pure air, or _oxigen_, contributes to the formation of\r\nthe spirit, of which it is one of the constituting principles. A short\r\ntime, however, suffices to renew the air of the room.\r\n\r\nIt is useless to remark, that the hogsheads must be open at one end, and\r\nrest upon pieces of wood elevating them some inches from the ground.\r\nThey must remain uncovered during the fermentation; and afterwards be\r\ncovered with a flying lid, when the liquor is calm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nOF THE ROOM FOR DISTILLATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto considered the liquor as containing only principles\r\nupon which the air has no action, and from which it can only extract\r\nsome watery vapors; and, in fact, all those principles contained in the\r\nliquor are fixed. The action of the fire may concentrate, but not\r\nvolatilize them.\r\n\r\nThe liquor is now changed by the fermentation; it contains no longer the\r\nsame principles, but has acquired those which it had not, which are\r\nvolatile, and evaporate easily. They must therefore be managed\r\ncarefully, in order not to lose the fruits of an already tedious labor.\r\nThe spirit already created in the fermented liquor, must be collected by\r\nthe distillation; but in transporting it to the still, the action of the\r\nexternal air must be carefully avoided, as it would cause the\r\nevaporation of some of the spirit. A pump to empty the hogsheads, and\r\ncovered pipes to conduct the liquor into the still, is what has been\r\nfound to answer that purpose. A good distilling apparatus is undoubtedly\r\nthe most important part of a distillery. It must unite solidity,\r\nperfection in its joints, economy of fuel, rapidity of distillation, to\r\nthe faculty of concentrating the spirit. Such are the ends I have\r\nproposed to myself in the following apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe usual shape of stills is defective; they are too deep, and do not\r\npresent enough of surface for their contents. They require a violent\r\nfire to bring them to ebullition; the liquor at bottom burns before it\r\nis warm at the top.\r\n\r\nMy still is made upon different principles, and composed of two pieces,\r\nviz. the kettle, and its lid. The kettle, forming a long square, is like\r\nthe kettle of infusion, already described, and only differs from it in\r\nbeing one foot deeper. The lid is in shape like an ancient bed tester;\r\nthat is to say, its four corners rise into a sharp angle, and come to\r\nsupport a circle 16 inches diameter, bearing a vertical collar of about\r\ntwo inches. This collar comes to the middle of the kettle, and is\r\nelevated about 4 feet from the bottom. The lid is fastened to the\r\nkettle. The collar receives a pewter cap, to which is joined a pipe of\r\nthe same metal, the diameter of which decreases progressively to a\r\nlittle less than 3 inches: this pipe, the direction of which is almost\r\nhorizontal, is 5 feet long.\r\n\r\nMy still, thus constructed, is established upon a furnace like that of\r\nthe infusion room. I observe that the side walls are only raised to the\r\nhalf of the height of the kettle. A vertical pipe is placed on the side\r\nopposite to the pewter one, and serves to fill up the still: it is\r\nalmost at the height of the fastening of the lid, but a little above. On\r\nthe same side, on a level with the bottom, is a pipe of discharge,\r\npassing across the furnace: this pipe must project enough to help to\r\nreceive or to direct the fluid residue of the distillation; its diameter\r\nmust be such as to operate a prompt discharge of the still.\r\n\r\n\r\nOF THE URNS.\r\n\r\nThese are copper vessels, thus called from their resembling those\r\nfuneral vases of the ancients. Mine have a bottom of about 18 inches\r\ndiameter; they are two feet high, have a bulge of 6 inches near the top,\r\nand then draw in to form an overture of about 8 inches.\r\n\r\nOn one side, towards the top, there is a copper pipe 2 inches diameter,\r\nprojecting externally 2 or 3 inches, and bent in an elbow: it enters the\r\ninternal part of the urn, and descends towards the bottom, without\r\ntouching it; there it is only a slight curve, and remains open.\r\n\r\nThe external part of that pipe is fitted to receive the pewter pipe of\r\nthe still; they are made so as to enter into one another, and must fit\r\nexactly. The round opening at the top of the urn receives a cap with a\r\npewter pipe, made like that of the still. It is likewise five feet\r\nlong, and its size in proportion to the opening: this goes and joins\r\nitself to the second urn, as the still does to the first. The pipe of\r\nthis second goes to a third, and the pipe of this last to the worm. The\r\nthree urns bear each a small pipe of discharge towards the bottom.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus must be made with the greatest care. Neither the joints,\r\nthe different pipes of communication, nor the nailings, must leave the\r\nsmallest passage to the vapors. The workman must pay the greatest\r\nattention to his work, and the distiller must lute exactly all the parts\r\nof the apparatus that are susceptible of it: he must be the more careful\r\nas to luting it, as this operation is only performed once a week, when\r\nthe apparatus is cleaned. At the moment of the distillation, the master\r\nor his foreman must carefully observe whether there is any waste of\r\nvapors, and remedy it instantly. The still and urns ought to be well\r\ntinned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nEFFECTS OF THIS APPARATUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the still might contain 400 gallons, there must be only 200\r\ngallons put into it: the rest remaining empty, the vapors develops\r\nthemselves, and rise. In that state, the vinous liquor is about one foot\r\ndeep, on a surface of 20 feet square: hence two advantages--the first,\r\nthat being so shallow, it requires but little fuel to boil; the second,\r\nthat the extent of surface gives rise to a rapid evaporation, which\r\naccelerates the work. This acceleration is such, that six distillations\r\nmight be obtained in one day. The spirit contained in the vinous liquor\r\nrises in vapors to the lid of the still, there find the cap and its\r\npipe, through which they escape into the first urn, by the side pipe\r\nabove described, which conducts them to the bottom, where they are\r\ncondensed immediately.\r\n\r\nBut the vapors, continuing to come into the urn, heat it progressively:\r\nthe spirituous liquor that it contains rises anew into vapors, escapes\r\nthrough the cap and pipe, and arrives into the second urn, where it is\r\ncondensed as in the first. Here again, the same cause produces the same\r\neffect: the affluence of the heat drawn with the vapors, carries them\r\nsuccessively into the third urn, and from thence into the worm, which\r\ncondenses them by the effects of the cold water in which it is immersed.\r\n\r\nThe urns, receiving no other heat than that which the vapors coming out\r\nof the still can transmit to them, raise the spirit; the water, at least\r\nthe greatest part of it, remains at the bottom: hence, what runs from\r\nthe worm is alcohol; that is, spirit at 35°. It is easily understood how\r\nthe vapors coming out of the still are rectified in the urns, and that\r\nthree successive rectifications bring the spirit to a high degree of\r\nconcentration: it gets lower only when the vinous liquor draws towards\r\nthe end of the distillation. As soon as it yields no more spirit, the\r\nfire is stopped, and the still is emptied in order to fill it up again,\r\nto begin a new distillation.\r\n\r\nEach time that the vinous liquor is renewed in the still, the water\r\ncontained in the urns must be emptied, through the pipes of discharge at\r\nthe bottom.\r\n\r\nMetals are conductors of the _caloric_. The heat accumulated in the\r\nstill, rises to the cap, from whence it runs into the urns: with this\r\ndifference--that the pewter, of which the cap and pipes are made,\r\ntransmits less caloric than copper, because it is less dense: and that\r\nbodies are only heated in reason of their density.\r\n\r\nHowever, a great deal of heat is still communicated to the worm, and\r\nheats the water in which it is immersed. I diminish this inconvenience\r\nby putting a wooden pipe between the worm and the pipe of the third urn.\r\nWood being a bad conductor of caloric, produces a _solution of\r\ncontinuity_, or interruption between the metals. The wood of this pipe\r\nmust be soft and porous, and not apt to work by the action of the fire:\r\nhowever, to avoid its splitting, I wrap it up in two or three doubles of\r\ngood paper, well pasted, and dried slowly. This pipe is one foot long,\r\nand hollowed in its length, so as to receive the pewter pipe of the\r\nthird urn at one end, and to enter the worm at the other; thereby the\r\nworm is not as hot, since it only receives the heat of the vapors which\r\nit condenses.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all these precautions, it heats the water in which it is\r\nimmersed after a length of time; and whatever care may be taken to renew\r\nit, all the vapors are not condensed, and this occasions a loss of\r\nspirit. I obviate this accident, by adding a second worm to the first:\r\nthey communicate by means of a wooden pipe like the above. The effect of\r\nthis second worm, rather smaller than the first, is such, that the water\r\nin which it is plunged remains cold, while that of the first must be\r\nrenewed very often. By these means, no portion of vapors escape\r\ncondensation. The liquor running from the worm is received into a small\r\nbarrel, care being taken that it may not lose by the contact of the air\r\nproducing evaporation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nOF FERMENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are of two kinds; the very putrescent bodies, and those supplied by\r\nthe _oxigen_. Animal substances are of the first kind: _acids_, neutral\r\nsalts, rancid oils, and metallic _oxids_, are of the second.\r\n\r\nWere I obliged to make use of a ferment of the first class, I would\r\nchoose the glutinous part of wheat flour. This vegeto-animal substance\r\nis formed in the following manner:--A certain quantity of flour is made\r\ninto a solid dough, with a little water. It is then taken into the\r\nhands, and water slowly poured over it, while it is kneaded again. The\r\nwater runs white, because it carries off the starchy part of the flour;\r\nit runs clear after it is washed sufficiently. There remains in the\r\nhands of the operator a dough, compact, solid, elastic, and reduced to\r\nnearly the half of the flour employed. This dough, a little diluted with\r\nwater, and kept in the temperature indicated for the room of\r\nfermentation, passes to the putrid state, and contracts the smell of\r\nspoiled meat. Four pounds of this dough per hogshead, seem to me to be\r\nsufficient to establish a good fermentation. A small quantity of good\r\nvinegar would answer the same purpose, and is a ferment of the second\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nBut are those means indispensable with my process? I do not think so.\r\n\r\n1st. The richness of my vinous liquor, and the degree of heat to which I\r\nkeep it, tend strongly to make it ferment. In fact, the infusion of the\r\ngrain, by taking from it its saccharine part, takes likewise part of its\r\nmucilaginous substance, which is the principle of the spirituous\r\nfermentation, which it establishes whenever it meets with the other\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\n2dly. The hogsheads themselves are soon impregnated with a fermenting\r\nprinciple, and communicate it to the liquor that is put into them.\r\n\r\n3dly. The rum distiller employs advantageously the residue of his\r\npreceding distillation, to give a fermentation to his new molasses: this\r\nresidue has within itself enough of acidity for that purpose. Might not\r\nthe residue of the distillation of my vinous liquor have the same\r\nacidity? It contains only the mucilaginous substance already acidulated.\r\nSome gallons of that residue to every hogshead, would, I think, be a\r\nvery good ferment.\r\n\r\nLastly. Here is another means which will certainly succeed: it is to\r\nleave at the bottom of each hogshead three or four inches of the vinous\r\nliquor, when transported into the still for distilling. This rising,\r\nwhich will rapidly turn sour, will form a ferment sufficient to\r\nestablish a good fermentation.\r\n\r\nThe intelligent manager of a distillery must conduct the means I\r\nindicate, towards the end which he proposes to himself, and must\r\ncarefully avoid to employ as ferments, those disgusting substances which\r\ncannot fail to bring a discredit on the liquor in which they are known\r\nto be employed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nOF THE AREOMETER, OR PROOF BOTTLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis instrument is indispensable to the distiller: it ascertains the\r\nvalue of his spirits, since it shows the result of their different\r\ndegrees of concentration. I will give the theory of this useful\r\ninstrument, as it may be acceptable to those who do not know it.\r\n\r\nBodies sink in fluids, in a _compound ratio_ to the volume and the\r\ndensity of those fluids, which they displace. It is from that law of\r\nnature, that a ship sinks 20 feet in fresh water, while it sinks only\r\nabout 18 feet in sea water, which has more density on account of the\r\nsalt dissolved therein.\r\n\r\nThe reverse of this effect takes place in fluids lighter than water, as\r\nbodies floating in them sink the more, as the liquor has less density.\r\nUpon those principles are made two kinds of areometers--one for fluids\r\ndenser than water; the other for those that are lighter: the first are\r\ncalled _salt proof_; the second _spirit proof_. Distilled water is the\r\nbasis of those two scales: it is at the top for the _salt proof_, and at\r\nthe bottom for the _spirit proof_; because the first is ascending, and\r\nthe other descending; but by a useless singularity, the distilled water\r\nhas been graduated at 10° for the spirit proof bottle, and at 0 for the\r\n_salt proof_. We shall only dwell upon the first, because it is the only\r\none interesting to the distiller.\r\n\r\nWater being graduated at 10° in the areometer, it results from thence\r\nthat the spirit going to 20°, is in reality only 10° lighter than water;\r\nand the alcohol gaaduated [TR: graduated] at 35°, is only 25° above\r\ndistilled water.\r\n\r\nThe areometer can only be just, when the atmosphere is temperate; that\r\nis, at 55° Fahrenheit, or 10° Reaumur. The variations in cold or heat\r\ninfluence liquors; they acquire density in the cold, and lose it in the\r\nheat: hence follows that the areometer does not sink enough in the\r\nwinter, and sinks too much in the summer.\r\n\r\nNaturalists have observed that variation, and regulated it. They have\r\nascertained that 1° of heat above temperate, according to the scale of\r\nReaumur, sinks the areometer 1/8 of a degree more; and that 1° less of\r\nheat, had the contrary effect: thus the heat being at 18° of Reaumur,\r\nthe spirit marking 21° by the areometer, is really only at 20°. The cold\r\nbeing at 8° below temperate, the spirit marking only 19° by the\r\nareometer, is in reality at 20°. 2-1/4 of Fahrenheit corresponding to 1°\r\nof Reaumur, occasion in like manner a variation of 1/8 of a degree:\r\nthus, the heat being at 78-1/2°, the spirit thus marking 21°, is only at\r\n20; and the cold being at 87°, the spirit marking only 19° by the\r\nareometer, is in reality at 20°.\r\n\r\nIt is easily conceived, that extreme cold or extreme heat occasion\r\nimportant variations. For that reason, there are in Europe inspectors,\r\nwhose duty it is to weigh spirits, particularly _brandy_: for that\r\npurpose they make use of the areometer and the thermometer. An\r\nareometer, to be good, must be proved with distilled water, at the\r\ntemperature of 55°. Areometers, being made of glass, are brittle, and\r\nmust be used with great care. This inconvenience might be remedied, by\r\nmaking them of silver; I have seen several of this metal. A good\r\nsilversmith could easily make them; I invite those artists to attend to\r\nthat branch of business; it might become valuable, as the distillers\r\nwill be more enlightened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nADVANTAGES OF MY METHOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first of all, is derived from the composition of a vinous liquor,\r\nricher, and more proper to raise a vigorous fermentation, than that\r\nwhich is obtained by the usual method. Now, as it is proved that the\r\nquantity of spirit is in proportion to the richness of the fermenting\r\nliquor, mine therefore yields a great deal more spirit than any other.\r\n\r\n2dly. We have seen that a heat of 75° or 80° must be kept up in the\r\nfermenting room: this being summer heat, proves that such a rich vinous\r\nliquor runs no risk of passing to the acid state with as much rapidity\r\nas that of the common distillers; and, consequently, that he who will\r\nfollow my method can work all the year round without fear of losing the\r\nfruits of his labor, as it often happens--an advantage precious for him\r\nwho makes it his sole business. The only change he has to make, is to\r\nsuppress the heat of the stove, when the temperature of the atmosphere\r\nis sufficient to keep up a good fermentation in the liquor.\r\n\r\nAs to my distilling apparatus, this is not a new idea. I present it to\r\nthe public under the sanction of experience. I had it executed in\r\nPhiladelphia eight years ago, after having obtained a patent. It was\r\nmade for a rum distillery, where they still continue to use it. It\r\npresents the greatest advantages.\r\n\r\nThe first is, that with a single fire, and a single workman, I distil\r\nand rectify the spirit three times, and bring it to the\r\ndegree of alcohol; that is, to the greatest purity, and almost to the\r\nhighest degree of concentration.\r\n\r\n2dly. It lowers the cost of transportation, by two-thirds; because one\r\ngallon at 35° represents three gallons at the usual degree. The\r\nmerchant, being arrived at the place of his destination, has only to add\r\n2 gallons of water to 1 gallon of this alcohol, in order to have 3\r\ngallons of whiskey; which is of a considerable advantage, either for\r\nland or sea carriage.\r\n\r\n3dly. As the price of spirits is, in trade, in proportion to their\r\ndegree of concentration, those made with my apparatus being at a very\r\nhigh degree, need no more rectifying, either for the retailer, the\r\napothecary, or the painter; and the considerable expenses of that\r\noperation turn entirely to the profit of the distiller, as they are\r\ntotally suppressed. Distillers may hereafter sell spirits of all degrees\r\nof concentration.\r\n\r\nSuch are the advantages of my processes. I offer them the more willingly\r\nto the public, as they are founded upon the most approved principles of\r\nnatural philosophy: by reflecting upon them, distillers will be easily\r\nconvinced of it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHowever perfect the description of a new thing may be, our ideas of it\r\nare always defective, until we have seen it put into practical use. Few\r\nmen have the means of establishing a distillery on a new plan, and even\r\nthe most enlightened may make notable errors. Few, besides, are bold\r\nenough to undertake, at their own risks, the trial of a new fabrication:\r\nthey are afraid of losing, and of being blamed for having too lightly\r\nyielded to the persuasion of new projectors. Hence it follows that a\r\nuseful discovery falls into oblivion, instead of doing any good.\r\n\r\nBut no discovery of general utility ought to experience that fate in a\r\nrepublic. Government itself ought to promote the first undertaking, or a\r\ncertain number of citizens ought to join in order to give it a start. It\r\nis the more easy in this case, as my apparatus requires very little\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nIf a distillery according to my directions, was established in some of\r\nthe principal towns of the state, my method would then make rapid\r\nprogress, and thus prove the truth of the principle which I have\r\nadvanced; and the distillers, after having meditated upon my method in\r\nthis book, would come and satisfy themselves of its goodness, by seeing\r\nit put into practice, and yielding the most perfect results, with all\r\nthe advantages for trade that may be expected: hence would naturally\r\nensue the rapid increase of distillation, and consequently that of\r\nagriculture and commerce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ART OF\r\nMAKING GIN,\r\nAFTER THE PROCESS OF THE\r\nHOLLAND DISTILLERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving indicated the most proper means of obtaining spirits, I will now\r\noffer to the public the manner of making _Gin_, according to the methods\r\nused by the distillers in Holland. It may be more properly joined to the\r\nart of making whiskey, as it adds only to the price of the liquor, that\r\nof the juniper berries, the product of which will amply repay its cost.\r\nMany distillers in the United States have tried to imitate the excellent\r\nliquor coming from Holland, under the name _gin_. They have imagined\r\ndifferent methods of proceeding, and have more or less attained their\r\nend. I have myself tried it, and my method is consigned in a patent.\r\n\r\nBut those imitations are far from the degree of perfection of the\r\nHolland gin: they want that unity of taste, which is the result of a\r\nsingle creation; they are visibly compounds, more or less well combined,\r\nand not the result of a spontaneous production.\r\n\r\nTo this capital defect, which makes those imitations so widely different\r\nfrom their original, is joined their high price, which prevents its\r\ngeneral consumption. In fact, it is made at a considerable expense: the\r\nwhiskey must be purchased, rectified and distilled over again with the\r\nberries. These expenses are increased by the waste of spirit occasioned\r\nby those reiterated distillations. This brings the price of this false\r\ngin to three times that of the whiskey: consequently the poorer sort of\r\npeople, whose number is always considerable, are deprived of the\r\nbenefits of a wholesome liquor, and restrained to whiskey, which is\r\ncommonly not so.\r\n\r\nThe methods used in Holland, have reduced gin to the lowest price; that\r\nof the juniper berries being there very trifling, and increasing but\r\nlittle the price of whiskey: still that small addition is almost reduced\r\nto nothing, as will be seen hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe United States are, in some parts, almost covered with the tree\r\ncalled here _cedar_; which tree is no other than the juniper, and grows\r\nalmost every where, and bears yearly a berry, which is in reality the\r\njuniper berry. Some Hollanders knew it at Boston, collected considerable\r\nquantities of it in Massachusetts, and shipping it to some of the\r\neastern harbors, sold it as coming from Holland. I have seen some at\r\nPhiladelphia ten years ago, at the house of a Hollander, who received it\r\nfrom Massachusetts in hogsheads of about ten hundred weight, and sold as\r\nthe produce of his own country, what was really that of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nI collected myself a great quantity of those berries, at Norfolk, Va. by\r\nmeans of negroes, to whom I paid one dollar per bushel of 40 lbs. being\r\n2-1/2 cts. per pound. Two years ago, it sold for 6 cents in\r\nPhiladelphia, and bore the same price at Pittsburgh.\r\n\r\nThere is a great deal of cedar in Kentucky, and consequently of berries.\r\nI have seen them at Blue Licks, and they abound near the Kentucky\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nAlthough an incredible number of those trees is cut down daily, there is\r\nstill a greater number standing, in the United States; and millions of\r\nbushels of berries are lost every year, while only skilful hands are\r\nwanted, to make them useful to mankind. The juniper berry has many\r\nmedical properties: it is a delightful aromatic, and contains an oil\r\nessential, and a sweet extract, which by the fermentation yields a\r\nvinous liquor, made into a sort of wine in some countries; that is\r\ncalled wine for the poor: it strengthens the stomach, when debilitated\r\nby bad food or too hard labor.\r\n\r\nThe Hollanders, who have long had the art of trading upon every thing,\r\nhave constantly turned even their poverty to account. They have immense\r\nfabrications of gin, and scarcely any juniper trees. They only collect\r\nthe berry in those countries where it is neglected as useless, as in\r\nFrance and Tyrol, which produce a great deal of it. The United States\r\nneed have no recourse to Europe, in order to get the juniper berries:\r\nthey have in abundance at home, what the Hollanders can only procure\r\nwith trouble and money. They can therefore rival them with great\r\nadvantage; but they must follow the same methods employed in the Holland\r\ndistilleries.\r\n\r\nThe juniper berry contains the sweet mucous extract, in a great\r\nproportion: it has therefore the principle necessary to the spirituous\r\nfermentation; and, indeed, it ferments spontaneously. When fresh, and\r\nheaped up, it acquires a degree of heat, but not enough to burn, as I\r\nhave ascertained: it is therefore safely transported in hogsheads. From\r\nthat facility of fermenting, it must be considered as a good ferment,\r\nand as increasing the quantity of spirit, when joined to a fermentable\r\nliquor.\r\n\r\nA distiller may at pleasure convert his whiskey into gin. He needs only\r\nto perfume the wort which he puts in fermentation, by adding a certain\r\nquantity of the berries, slightly broken: the fermentation is then\r\ncommon to both; their sweet mucosity enriches that of the wort, and\r\nincreases the spirit, while at the same time the soapy extract, which is\r\nthe proximate principle of vegetation, yields the essential oil, which\r\nperfumes the liquor.[C]\r\n\r\nThe fermentation being common to both substances, unites them\r\nintimately; and when, by the distillation, the spirit is separated from\r\nthe water, there remains an homogenous liquor, resulting from a single\r\ncreation, and having that unity of taste, and all the properties of\r\nHolland gin, because obtained by the same means.\r\n\r\nOne single and same distillation can therefore yield to the distiller\r\neither gin or whiskey, as it requires no more labor, and its conversion\r\ninto gin costs only the price of the berries, which repays him amply,\r\neither by the spirit it yields, or by its essential oil, which, floating\r\non the surface, may be easily collected. This oil bears a great price,\r\nand the Hollanders sell much of it.\r\n\r\nWe have seen, in the 10th chapter of this work, that my hogsheads for\r\nthe fermentation, contain about 120 gallons of wort, being the\r\nproduction of the saccharine extract of 12 bushels of grain. The\r\nintelligent distiller will himself determine the quantity of berries\r\nnecessary for each hogshead to have a good aromatic perfume. He may\r\nbegin with 10 lbs. per hogshead; and will, upon trial, judge whether or\r\nnot this quantity is sufficient, or must be increased. At any rate,\r\neconomy should not be consulted in the use of the berries, since their\r\nprice does not increase that of the whiskey. This low price must\r\nnaturally become the principle of an immense fabrication of gin; and\r\nhenceforth it will be an important article of exportation for the United\r\nStates, as well as a considerable and wholesome object of home\r\nconsumption.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] Some rum distillers make a stronger vinous liquor, but it is still\r\nvery far from Lavoisier's proportions. Others add successively new\r\nmolasses to their vinous liquor, and thus prolong their fermentation,\r\nwithout making their liquor stronger, and consequently without obtaining\r\nmore spirit. This is absolutely contrary to the true principles of\r\ndistillation.\r\n\r\n[B] See his beautified operation on the decomposition of water.\r\n\r\n[C] I must here observe, that the juniper berry, as well as several\r\nother fruits, contains two kinds of essential oil: one is the proximate\r\nprinciple of vegetation, and the other is the superabundant oil: the\r\nfirst is combined with the soapy extract, and dissolves in water; while\r\nthe second does not unite with it, and floats on the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nEND\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The Art of Making Whiskey, by Anthony Boucherie",
