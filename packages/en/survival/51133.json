Then follows Arthur\r\nSelwyn-Brown's \"History of Science,\" an excellent foundation for the\r\nstudy of man's achievements in his struggle to understand and turn to\r\nhis own use the forces of nature. Here is a concise record of progress\r\nfrom the earliest times until now--discoveries and inventions past,\r\npresent, and about to come.\r\n\r\nThe third part of Volume XVI occupies nearly half the book. It is the\r\nGeneral Index, which is as complete and as practical as it is possible\r\nfor an index to be. Here, then, we have sixteen volumes on science,\r\nevery work agreeable to read, every work complete in itself, and all of\r\nthem, including the Index, prepared by specialists, each of whom has\r\nalready gained distinction in the field he covers. The Index binds the\r\ncollection into a consistent whole, making every bit of knowledge in\r\nthe sixteen books available to reader or student without delay.\r\n\r\nThe style employed in the Index is a standard for such material. Volume\r\nnumbers are represented by the Roman numerals, i, ii, iii, iv, v, vi,\r\nvii, viii, ix, x, xi, xii, xiii, xiv, xv, xvi. Pages are indicated by\r\nfigures. All topics and subtopics are arranged alphabetically.\r\n\r\nWhen you read or study the Popular Science Library, keep the Index\r\nvolume at hand whenever it is convenient. It will add greatly to your\r\ninterest and give you a depth of insight into these matters if you can\r\ncompare one author's opinions and descriptions with those of another.\r\nIf you are consulting the Library as a reference collection for\r\ninformation on particular topics, the Index will give you volume and\r\npage for every bit of text on the subject you are considering.\r\n\r\nThe Popular Science Library is unique in the number and standing of\r\nits authors and in the care that has been taken to make it the easiest\r\nas well as the most engrossing of all scientific collections for the\r\nreader or student to use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                     PAGE\r\n\r\n  HOW TO USE THE POPULAR SCIENCE LIBRARY.

If, as certain persons assert, science may\r\nbe accused of having rendered war more destructive and terrible, yet,\r\non the other hand, no one can deny that it was science that saved the\r\nworld from sliding backward into an age of despotism.\r\n\r\nThe true importance of science for everybody arises from its rapidly\r\nincreasing service in the development of human industry in all its\r\nforms, for industry is the mother of democracy.\r\n\r\nSaid Gabriel Lippman, the French physicist, inventor of color\r\nphotography, who died in the summer of 1921: \"For thousands of years\r\nscience progressed by groping and feeling its way, and coincidentally\r\nindustry got slowly on by guesswork; but within the last century\r\nscience has developed more than during all preceding time, while\r\nindustry has sprung upon its feet and begun to march with the strides\r\nof a giant.\"\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding its immense importance and the vast extent and\r\ncomplication of its application in modern times, science is not\r\nreally difficult for any person of ordinary school education and of\r\ngood natural intelligence to comprehend, provided it is presented\r\nin a clear, plain, common sense manner, in popular language with\r\nillustrations drawn from everyday life and experience. The much\r\ntalked-of methods of science are, after all, nothing more than the\r\nmethods of common sense, applied with systematic care by minds\r\ndisciplined to a high degree of efficiency. And, in fact, the only\r\npractical difference between the mind of a trained scientist and that\r\nof any other intelligent person is that the scientist has acquired a\r\nway or habit of looking at and thinking about things and events, which\r\nenables him to get at their inmost nature and meaning more swiftly and\r\naccurately than he could do if he went to work in a haphazard manner\r\nas, in truth, his forerunners of the earlier centuries were obliged\r\nto do. The pioneer must always work by rule of thumb, but when he has\r\nexploited his field he knows better ways.\r\n\r\nEach branch of science has its own particular methods, but it is\r\nnot necessary for the average reader to study these special methods\r\nin order to become able to grasp the facts and principles that have\r\nbeen developed by them. The results are all thrown into a common\r\nstore--or should be if science is to attain its utmost usefulness to\r\nhumanity--and from the common store the great public, the people at\r\nlarge, should be enabled freely to draw. The object of this series of\r\nbooks is to form such a store of science for the people.\r\n\r\nIt may encourage those who look with some degree of timidity upon the\r\ntask of trying to understand the great discoveries and achievements\r\nof modern science to know that even the ablest scientists, leaders in\r\ntheir own particular branches, do not pretend, or attempt, to grasp the\r\nspecial methods or the technicalities of any division of science except\r\nthat one in which their own work is done. They stand, with regard to\r\nother branches, practically on the same footing with the unscientific\r\nreader, having over him only such possible advantages as their special\r\ntraining in clear thinking and in the intense application of the mental\r\npowers may give them.\r\n\r\nBesides, science is really the most interesting thing in the\r\nworld--outside of men and women--and _they_ would be less interesting,\r\neven to themselves, if science had not transformed their lives as well\r\nas their surroundings. If one of Voltaire's favorite messengers from\r\nsome other, wiser world had visited our earth a few hundred years ago,\r\nor even only one hundred, and should now repeat his call, he would be\r\namazed, and no doubt delighted, by the changes in every feature of life\r\nand society which he would find that science had brought about, as if\r\nby magic, during the interval between his visits. He would be likely to\r\nexclaim: \"Some great teacher and trainer from a more enlightened part\r\nof the universe must have been here since I saw this world before. What\r\na marvelous new spirit he has imparted to these creatures. Through him\r\nthey have become more masterful and more like sons of God.\"\r\n\r\nSee if you can find a single detail of your daily life that is not\r\naffected by science, or upon which science does not throw new light. It\r\nis fascinating to trace out the scientific relations of the simplest\r\nthings that surround us, or the most ordinary occurrences and incidents.\r\n\r\nStart with your first awakening in the morning, and you will perceive\r\nthat there is not a thing that you see, or that in any way attracts\r\nyour attention, that is not touched and illuminated by science, and\r\noften in the most unexpected and delightful ways. It is by considering\r\nthese things that one may best perceive how to use the volumes of this\r\nlittle library. As you open your eyes in the morning you see a bright\r\nglow through the window curtain, then you know that the sun has risen.\r\n\r\nBut stop a moment. What does that mean--\"the sun has risen\"? The\r\nsun has not \"risen\" at all. But, one of the greatest facts of the\r\nscience of astronomy is illustrated before your eyes--a fact that it\r\ntook mankind thousands of years to find out. You are standing in the\r\nastronomer's shoes now, if you choose to wear them. This is a part\r\nof his field of science. It took him a long time to convince the\r\nworld that the \"rising\" of the sun in the east next morning after\r\nits \"setting\" in the west really means that the globular earth has\r\nturned half way over during the night. If this seems simple to you\r\nnow, it seemed very hard to comprehend to our remote ancestors, who,\r\nthough reasoning men like ourselves, had not learned as much about the\r\nrelativity of motion as we now know, though even we may be puzzled by\r\nsome of the consequences that Einstein has drawn from it. And a hundred\r\nother things that astronomy has discovered about the sun and the other\r\nsuns, called stars, and the other worlds, called planets, immediately\r\nrush to your mind, and you turn to the volume on astronomy to read\r\nabout them.\r\n\r\nBut this is only a beginning of the string of everyday incidents\r\nthat are rendered curiously interesting as soon as their scientific\r\nrelations and meanings become evident to you. Science is right at your\r\nelbow to raise questions and to answer them the moment you step out of\r\nbed, and your mind begins to work.\r\n\r\nAs you throw open the window to see what kind of a day it is going to\r\nbe, whether fair, or cloudy, or rainy, cool or warm, you draw your\r\nconclusions from the appearance of sky and air, but in doing that\r\nyou are entering another field covered by another branch of science\r\nand included in our little library--meteorology, or the realm of the\r\nair--and you may be sure that the correctness of the conclusions that\r\nyou draw from the aspect of the clouds and the feeling of the air will\r\nbe greatly increased, not only in certainty, but also in interest,\r\nif you read what the students of this subject have learned about the\r\nlaws and the mysteries of the rains, clouds, cyclones, barometric\r\npressures, great winds and genial breezes, great storms and little\r\nstorms; in short, the whole wonderful science of the atmosphere, that\r\ninvisible, yet powerful kingdom of the air, which we are just beginning\r\nto annex to our world of activities without regard to what its natural\r\noccupants, the birds, think of such an invasion.\r\n\r\nNow you leave the window to begin making your morning ablutions. You\r\nturn on a faucet and take a drink, or plunge hands and face into the\r\nrefreshing liquid, so cool, lively, and invigorating. But a bird or\r\nany four-footed animal may find just as keen physical enjoyment in the\r\ntouch and taste of the water as you do. You, however, because you are\r\na thinking being, possess a source of enjoyment from the touch and\r\nappearance of the water that is not open to those humbler creatures,\r\nand that source of enjoyment springs from the principles and facts of\r\nanother branch of science which the mere sight of the running water may\r\ncall to mind if you have caught the spirit of these books--the science\r\nof chemistry, whose early history is filled with that irresistible\r\nkind of romance that pertains to the search for Eldorado, or the\r\nstrivings of the human spirit after the powers of magic; for the realm\r\nof chemistry was once a kind of semi-scientific dreamland, wherein the\r\n\"alchemists\" delved at the same time for the \"philosopher's stone\"\r\nwhich was to turn base metal into gold, and for the wand of the\r\nmagician which would give to its possessor the boundless gratifications\r\nof a Faust. Water is no mystery to the lower animals, but it is a great\r\nmystery even yet to the highest ones--ourselves--because we have been\r\nenabled to analyze it. You cannot look at it pouring from the faucet,\r\nand sparkling into bubbles, without recalling the fact that it is\r\ncomposed of two invisible, silent gases, and that chemistry tells us\r\nnot only how to make the water disappear by taking those gases apart,\r\nbut also how to form new water by making the two gases combine. The\r\nmystery is--why should this be so? It is a captivating question, and\r\nthe business of the book on chemistry is to give you all possible light\r\non the solution of that question, and others of a like nature. You\r\nwill find, too, that the very latest chemistry has, strangely enough,\r\ndiscovered a sort of justification for the extravagant expectations of\r\nthe ancient alchemists, by finding a way in which one substance may\r\nactually change, or be changed, into another, different substance--one\r\n\"element\" taking the form of another \"element\"--and also by getting\r\nclues to the existence of marvelous locked-up energies in matter, the\r\nrelease of which would give man control over powers that could properly\r\nbe called \"magical.\"\r\n\r\nAfter finishing your toilet, with all the suggestions and remembrances\r\nof chemical science that it has produced, you start to quicken the\r\ncirculation of your blood by catching up a pair of dumb-bells, or\r\nIndian clubs, or by pulling elastic cords, or banging a leather ball\r\nwith your fists, as if you meant to go in for the championship of\r\nthe world. Now, what taught you the value of such exercises? You are\r\nstill on the ground of science, and you are practically demonstrating\r\nthe principles of another of its branches--the science of health, or\r\nhygiene, which is a part of the subject of medicine, taken in its\r\nbroadest signification, for, as the volume on that subject will assure\r\nyou, the greatest service that this science can render to mankind is\r\nin teaching us the laws of our physical existence, and indicating,\r\ndirectly or indirectly, how all the functions of the body may be kept\r\nin the best working order by proper attention and exercise. You will\r\nfind such things pointed out in the several sciences that deal with the\r\nbody, such as physiology and medicine.\r\n\r\nWhile you are making the leather ball strike the ceiling with\r\nresounding whacks, your dog, excited by the inspiring noise, bursts\r\ninto the room, and interrupts your exercise with his enthusiastic\r\nmorning greetings, expressed as energetically by his wagging tail as\r\nby his joyous barks and licks, all anticipatory of a lively morning\r\nrun. He brings immediately into your mind the thought of still another\r\ndivision of science--zoölogy--to which you will devote many pleasant\r\nhalf-hours of reading, for it is full of most entertaining matter, as\r\nwell as of matter calculated to awaken profound and useful thought\r\nconcerning the relations of the many different members of the animal\r\nworld to one another, and especially to their head and chief, man, to\r\nwhom the supervision of the whole was, according to the Bible story,\r\noriginally committed. Familiar as your dog may be to you, there are a\r\nhundred particulars of his family relationships, his descent from wild\r\nancestors, etc., which can only become known to you through the studies\r\nthat have been devoted to the science of zoölogy by curious-minded\r\ninvestigators from the times of Aristotle and Pliny down to our own\r\nday, when we have seen an ex-President of the United States wandering\r\nadventurously through some of the remotest portions of the inhabited\r\nglobe, seeking fresh knowledge of, and personal acquaintance with, the\r\nrarer kinds of wild animals, and hunting down in their native wilds\r\ngreat beasts which the Cæsars used to admire from the security of the\r\nimperial seat, high above the bloody sands of the Roman arenas. And\r\nthis modern ruler, after having laid down the political power intrusted\r\nto him by fellow citizens, found no occupation so attractive as that of\r\nadding something to the growing stores of science.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n         Painting, Chas.

HORSE AND HUNTING DOG OF LONG AGO\r\n\r\nFrom an ancient Cretan fresco]\r\n\r\nNext, your stomach, awakened to its wants and needs by the restored\r\ncirculation resulting from your lively exercises, reminds you of what\r\nwill be at the same time a pleasure and a means of sustained strength\r\nfor body and mind, your breakfast. Breakfast properly comes under\r\nthe supervision of the science of physiology. It is also suggestive\r\nof mechanics and physics, since it has to do with the stoking of the\r\nfurnace that keeps the bodily engine up to its work. Here you are face\r\nto face with a branch of science which you could no more safely neglect\r\nthan an engineer or a fireman could neglect to learn the elements and\r\nprinciples underlying his critically important occupation. One of the\r\nfirst sciences to be systematically developed was that of man's body,\r\nincluding its structure, or anatomy, and its functioning, or internal\r\naction, physiology. You will find that correct ideas on these subjects\r\nwere slow in being developed, yet even in the most ancient times men\r\nwere shrewd and wise enough to understand the importance of knowing\r\nsomething about their own bodies, in order to be able to take proper\r\ncare of them, and to deal with wounds and sickness.\r\n\r\nIt was an old saying that \"the proper study of mankind is man.\" But\r\nthat is a study which has two main branches. The first covers the\r\nsubjects of physiology, anatomy, medicine, etc., while the second\r\nrelates to that even more intimate part of ourselves which has ever\r\nbeen a fascinating mystery, and which we call the mind, or sometimes\r\nthe soul. This is the theme of the science of psychology, whose name\r\ncomes from that delicate, inscrutable spirit, _Psyche_, the Soul,\r\nwhich plays like a flitting sunbeam through the magical atmosphere of\r\nGreek mythology. Now, this subtle and exquisite science, often more\r\npoetic and mystic than scientific in its original character, presents\r\nitself in its more sober and practical dress to you as soon as, having\r\nfinished your breakfast and prepared your bodily energies for the day's\r\nwork, you begin to meditate on the problems of the day opening before\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nWhen you went to bed, perhaps your mind was agitated by some important\r\nmatter of business through whose intricacies you could not clearly\r\nsee your way. You turned and tossed on your pillow, and stated and\r\nrestated the facts and arguments and lines of reasoning, but all the\r\nwhile they became more obscure and entangled until at last, in sheer\r\nexhaustion, you fell into a troubled sleep. But this morning, to your\r\nimmense surprise and gratification, without any effort on your part,\r\nand while you are occupied with other things--putting on your clothes,\r\nhitting the ball, playing with the dog, eating your bacon and eggs, or\r\nwhat not--suddenly the elusive clue or solution, so vainly sought the\r\nnight before, presents itself plain before you. In an instant, in the\r\ntwinkling of an eye, the troublesome problem is solved, as easily and\r\nnaturally as water runs down hill, and you are provoked at yourself for\r\nhaving been so dull and stupid as not to see it all before. But not so\r\nfast! You were stupid, to be sure, but it was not your mind's fault as\r\nyou are now disposed to think, but the trouble lay in your physical\r\nfatigue. You were driving your brain too long without refreshment, and\r\nit became like an engine whose oil cups are empty. It could not receive\r\nand report the impressions of thought.\r\n\r\nNow this kind of experience comes many times to many men and women,\r\nand it is the purpose of the book on psychology in this series to\r\nmake everybody acquainted with the laws of the working of our minds\r\nthrough our brains. Yet, how many of those who are frequently puzzled\r\nby such things are aware that there is a branch of science, one of\r\nthe most captivatingly interesting of all, devoted especially to this\r\nsubject? By studying the volume on psychology you will get light on\r\njust such things as so greatly puzzled you, and haunted you, before the\r\nsolution of your problem unexpectedly rose up, as it were, and stood\r\nplain before you on the breakfast table, after having for twenty-four\r\nhours resisted your utmost efforts to master it, or even to get an\r\neffective hold upon it. It is unnecessary to speak of the immense\r\nimportance to all human beings of a knowledge of the laws governing the\r\nmanifestations of the mind, by taking advantage of which they may get\r\nthe most out of themselves with the least loss of time and expenditure\r\nof effort.\r\n\r\nLet us keep on further along the wonderful road of science on which\r\nyour feet begin almost unknowingly to tread from the moment of your\r\nawakening, and which they follow, often just as unconsciously, until\r\nyou fall asleep at the close of another day; while, as we have just\r\nseen, even when we are asleep our minds are not altogether inactive,\r\nand may even secretly disentangle the puzzles of the day while our\r\ntired brains are restoring themselves with slumber. Perhaps you live\r\nin the suburbs of a city, or far from the business center, and have to\r\ntake a considerable journey from your house to your place of work or\r\nbusiness. Maybe you go by automobile, or by street car, or by a trolley\r\nroute, or take a commuters' train. In any event, whether you drive your\r\nown car, or ride in one drawn by a motor or a locomotive engine, you\r\nare brought face to face with the science of physics, including, of\r\ncourse, not only mechanics, but also, in our own day, electricity and\r\nmagnetism. If you glance at a steam locomotive, puffing and blowing,\r\nand then at a smooth, silent electric motor drawing a long train, and\r\nthen at a swift automobile winding and turning with serpentine agility\r\nthrough crowds of slow horse-drawn vehicles--in all cases your memory\r\nmust recall the long, hard road by which these things were brought\r\nabout, and you must be lacking in intelligent curiosity if you do not\r\nresolve to know for yourself, not only the history of these triumphs of\r\nhuman invention, but the principles of action upon which they depend.\r\nIf you have a car, it would be a good thing to drive it yourself and\r\nlearn to take care of its machinery yourself, for thus you would go far\r\ntoward mastering the elementary principles of the science of mechanics,\r\nwhich has done more than all other things combined to transform the\r\nface of the world we live in. You cannot, of course, acquire all\r\nthis knowledge by practical experience, but by putting together what\r\nyou observe with what you read in the volumes devoted to mechanics,\r\nphysics, chemistry, electricity, etc., you will find that every day is\r\na school day for you in which you have learned something new, useful,\r\nand interesting, and something, moreover, which every wide-awake\r\nperson in this wide-awake age ought necessarily to know, and can know\r\nby pursuing such a course as that just suggested. Your morning's ride\r\nto work will be transformed into a delightful intellectual experience\r\nif you prepare yourself by a little daily reading to understand the\r\nconstruction and manner of working of all the machines, engines, and\r\nmechanisms presented on every side to your inspection.\r\n\r\nBut machinery is not everything in life. Suppose that as you ride\r\nalong your eye is caught by the great beauty of the flower gardens\r\nby the roadside, their blossoms bright in the morning sunshine and\r\nsparkling with the yet undried dew, as if sprinkled with diamonds.\r\nPerhaps your attention may never before have happened to be called\r\nso strongly to these objects, and possibly you have hitherto remained\r\nalmost unacquainted with the names and peculiarities of some of the\r\nmost common plants and flowers. But this morning, for some accidental\r\nreason, which may have a psychological origin, you are particularly\r\ncharmed with the brilliant sight, and you resolve that you will be no\r\nlonger ignorant of what could, manifestly, give you so much pleasure,\r\nbesides being of unquestionable usefulness. When you return home you\r\nwill take up the volume on botany, and it may lead you into a realm of\r\nmental delight previously unknown to you.\r\n\r\nIf it is the springtime, you may be interested by the sight of a tall,\r\ngraceful tree, as lofty as a pine, and as straight in trunk, with many\r\nexquisite blossoms hanging from the pendulous stems on its great limbs,\r\nfifty or more feet above the ground, as if it were a flower garden in\r\nthe air for the special delectation of the birds. Having never heard of\r\na flowering tree outside the tropics, you feel a keen desire to know\r\nwhat this one is, and thus a way of introduction, founded on keen,\r\npersonal interest, is opened for you to the science of botany. And\r\nfew persons can take a ride, or a walk, anywhere in city or country\r\nor park, without having attention attracted by some unknown flower or\r\nplant, or tree, and without becoming aware how much pleasure is lost,\r\nand how much useful knowledge missed, by lack of the easily acquired\r\nknowledge of these things, which anybody can have by giving to it\r\nonly that amount of time which would otherwise be wasted almost as\r\ncompletely as if the eyes were kept closed and the mind dismissed from\r\nits home in the brain. More mysterious, and not less fascinating than\r\nflowers and trees, are the birds and insects that flit by on their own\r\nerrands. To explain them you have the volume on zoölogy, the science of\r\nanimal life. Botany and zoölogy together go far to revolutionize the\r\nordinary man's ideas about the attractiveness of outdoor life.\r\n\r\nFor the cultivator of the soil, whether farmer, gardener, or fruit\r\ngrower, botany, of course, is the queen of sciences--though he may not\r\nsafely remain ignorant of the others mentioned, which form a brilliant\r\ncourt for his queen. In no direction has science lately proved itself\r\nso indispensable as in the application of botanical knowledge to the\r\nimprovement of agricultural operations of all kinds. In France, always\r\none of the richest of lands in this respect, the government has since\r\nthe war made special provisions for placing instruction in botany and\r\nplant physiology, and the results of all advances in the science of\r\nthe vegetable kingdom, before the pupils of the primary as well as\r\nthose of the secondary and higher schools. Botanical reading and study\r\nare encouraged in every possible way. One of the most significant\r\npropositions for the extension of this educational reform consists in\r\nthe suggestion that the schools in the country districts give much more\r\nattention to the various branches of botanical knowledge than the city\r\nschools do, for the purpose not only of supplying instruction that will\r\nbe of fundamental practical use to the young people who grow up on\r\nthe land and are to make its cultivation their life's occupation, but\r\nalso of stimulating a love of the country for itself, its scenes, its\r\natmosphere, its society, its amusements, and its simple, beautiful, and\r\nhealthful ways of life.\r\n\r\nAs your train, or car, rushes through a rock cut where the roadway\r\nhas been carried, without change of level or grade, through the\r\nround back of a hill, you may happen to see on the side walls of the\r\nexcavation curious striations, or cross checkings, of the rock surface,\r\nor alternate strata, or layers, of varying color and texture; some\r\ncomposed of smooth-faced stone, of a dark, uniform color, and others\r\nof coarse granular masses of variegated hue, some of whose particles\r\nflash like microscopic mirrors in the glancing sunlight that grazes\r\nthe top of the cut. Here, then, you are plunged into the wonder\r\nworld of the geologist and the mineralogist, the subject of one of\r\nthe most interesting of our volumes. That man must indeed be dull of\r\nintellect who does not feel a thrill of interest at the sight of these\r\nsigns and inscriptions, written by the ancient hand of nature in the\r\nrocks, and telling, in language far more easily decipherable than the\r\nhieroglyphics of Egypt, the story of the gradual growth of this round\r\nplanet on whose surface we are confined, like flies or ants, as it\r\nrotates and revolves in empty space, circling with us around a star,\r\nninety-three million miles away, called the sun, which saw the birth of\r\nour world and has ever since kept it warmed and lighted with its rays.\r\n\r\nIn those layers of rock in the railway cut you see the leaves of the\r\nbook of geology, infinitely older than the oldest scripture from man's\r\nhands, and relating things that occurred in those far-off nights and\r\nmornings of time that flitted over the globe ages before the human\r\nstem had set off from the trunk of terrestrial life. These geologic\r\npages speak of occurrences in the building of the world that happened\r\nmillions of years ago, and millions of years apart, though they have\r\nleft marks and vestiges that the eye can discern as easily as if they\r\nhad been the work of yesterday. No observant person can ride twenty\r\nmiles through the country, especially in a hilly region, without having\r\nthe fundamental facts of geology continually before him, and all that\r\nhe needs in order to comprehend these things is a little preparatory\r\nreading, accompanied and followed by intelligent thought and\r\nobservation. Anybody to whom all rocks look alike, and all hills the\r\nsame, needs a little awakening of the mind. He is one of the persons\r\nhad in view when this series was conceived and written, and he has no\r\noccasion to feel in the slightest degree offended by such a statement,\r\nfor the simple fact that probably ninety-nine one-hundredths of his\r\nfellow citizens, and they among the best in the community, are just\r\nas unfamiliar with the plainest facts of geology as he is. Geology is\r\nnot a difficult science to master in its main outlines, and there are\r\nfew more fascinating when once its drift is caught. Even the beginner\r\nin the reading of the volume on geology, by seizing such chances of\r\nobservation as every ride or walk affords, may in a very short time\r\nacquire the ability to read the history of a landscape from its face,\r\nto recognize the work of the glaciers in the great Age of Ice, to\r\nsee where ancient streams flowed, or where molten rock has gushed up\r\nthrough the surface layers of the earth's crust, and even to recognize\r\non sight some of the fossils, which are under everybody's feet in some\r\nparts of the country, and which still retain the forms of animals some\r\nof which were among the primal inhabitants of the earth, whose lines\r\nhave died out, while others, though their individual lives expired tens\r\nor hundreds of millions of years ago, bear in their fossilized forms a\r\nclose resemblance to modern relatives and descendants whose generations\r\nstill flourish in the living world in this twentieth century of man's\r\nlatest historic era.\r\n\r\nPresently, turning from the attractions of the outdoor world, which\r\nseem just as entrancing the hundredth time you look upon them as they\r\ndid the first time, particularly if you have cultivated the habit not\r\nmerely of noticing but of thinking and reading about them, you take\r\nup the morning newspaper, in which most of your companions of the car\r\nare already deeply buried, and amid the political news, the personal\r\ngossip, the inevitable exploitation of the deeds of criminals, the\r\nforeign intelligence, and the social gossip that falls under your eyes,\r\nyour attention is caught (this is an actual happening of not long ago)\r\nby the headline: \"John Daniel, the orang-utan, is dead.\" This sounds\r\nodd. There has been no animal's obituary in the papers since Barnum\r\nlost his biggest elephant, and bequeathed its skeleton to science. You\r\nread further and find an interview with a professor about the human\r\nrelationships, or apparent relationships, of the anthropoid apes, of\r\nwhom \"John Daniel\" would probably have been the acknowledged king if\r\nhis relatives of the woods could have understood the regard in which\r\nhe was held by his white-skinned and clothes-wearing jailers. You\r\nwill probably cut out that paragraph and put it aside for further\r\nconsideration, remembering that there are at least three volumes in\r\nyour Popular Science set at home, that on zoölogy, that on geology,\r\nand that on anthropology, in which there will be an abundance of\r\ninteresting and authoritative matter bearing on this most important\r\nsubject--for important you will consider it now that the death of a\r\nkind of caricature of humanity in the zoölogical garden that had so\r\nlong amused the children as well as their elders with its humanlike\r\nmotions, habits, looks, and pranks, has suddenly brought the whole\r\nquestion up among the news of the day, affording you a new light on\r\na matter which you had hitherto thought to belong exclusively to the\r\nfield of the professors of zoölogy and their students. Hereafter you\r\nwill disposed to take a broader view of all these things, and will be\r\nin a better position to understand and enjoy the discussions of learned\r\nscientists when they are interviewed by newspaper men on subjects of\r\nthis kind. The inquiring spirit of the time requires this concession\r\neven if in your private opinion there is no real relationship between\r\nmen and apes. And, without regard to any such questions, you will find\r\nthe volume on anthropology immensely interesting and informing.\r\n\r\nFinally, as your morning's trip comes to an end, your attention is\r\nrecalled from the natural to the mechanical sciences. You descend\r\nfrom your car or train, to go to your office. Your now fully awakened\r\nmind, alert to all the scientific relations of everything about you,\r\ncan no longer keep from dwelling upon the underlying meanings of this\r\nmarvelous display of realized human dreams. With the speed of the wind\r\nyou are carried deep under the city's pavements, inclosed in a little\r\nflying parlor, in the midst of an artificial subterranean daylight,\r\nfar beyond the reach of the solar rays, emulating the self-luminous\r\ncreatures of the deep sea bottom; or you go shooting past the window of\r\nthird, fourth, and fifth stories, or even above the levels of roofs,\r\nand you cannot but reflect and marvel that electricity does it all;\r\nelectricity, that strange imp with blue star eyes no bigger than pin\r\npoints, and a child's crown of little crinkling, piercing rays, which\r\nseemed so amusing when you were at school in the old days of frictional\r\nelectric machines, when it was a great joke to give the cat a shock\r\nand see her flee with a squall, her hair standing on end in spite\r\nof herself. But now electricity has become a giant of unrivaled and\r\nterrific power, spurning the heavy-limbed Brobdingnag, steam, from its\r\nswift path, and fast making the world all its own--except its master,\r\nman, who is still, however, half afraid of his new and all-capable\r\nservant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EXHIBITION OF COPIES OF PREHISTORIC PAINTINGS FROM THE\r\nCAVERNS AT ALTAMIRA, SPAIN]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  Painting by Chas. R. Knight. Photo, American Museum of Natural History\r\n\r\nTHE SABER-TOOTHED TIGER THAT ROAMED OVER NORTH AMERICA IN PREHISTORIC\r\nTIMES]\r\n\r\nThis modern genie of limitless power, conjured out of his deceptive\r\nbottle, can do the smallest as well as the greatest things for you.\r\nWhen, upon reaching your office, you telephone to your wife that Mr.\r\nBlank will be home to dinner with you, you cannot form the slightest\r\nidea of how the miracle of distant speech is accomplished unless you\r\nare either an electrician yourself, or have read intelligently upon the\r\nsubject of the applications of electricity to the motivation of all\r\nkinds of machinery, a subject to which an entire volume is devoted in\r\nour series. It would be a kind of shame and reproach to an intelligent\r\nman to be ignorant of the way his telephone works, and of the simple\r\nscientific principle on which it is constructed. If telephones, and\r\nsuch things, were products of nature and grew on trees, we might be\r\nexcusable for not knowing exactly their secret; but being made by men,\r\nwith the same limitations as those that circumscribe us all, we ought\r\nat least to understand them.\r\n\r\nThus, by a simple review of the series of common happenings that arrive\r\nevery day to everybody, we perceive how intimately and indissolubly\r\nthe various branches of science treated of in this compact library of\r\nscience, are linked with all that we do, including our most unconscious\r\nacts and our most habitual subjects of thought. We have taken for\r\nillustration the morning history of a person supposed to live amid\r\nurban or suburban surroundings. Equally illuminating would be that\r\nof an inhabitant of a village or a rural district, and even more\r\nsuggestive in many respects. The dweller in the country is brought\r\ninto closer association with the infinitely changing aspects of nature\r\nthan the city dweller enjoys. The simplest incident in the life of a\r\nperson living on a farm may be the beginning of a thread of connection\r\nleading, like the clue of a labyrinth, into the heart of some of the\r\nmost marvelous departments of science, and resulting in a mental\r\nrevolution for the fortunate person who follows out the clue under\r\nsuch guidance as these volumes afford. The writer has remembered from\r\nboyhood the indelible impression made upon his mind by the finding of\r\nan Indian arrowhead in a recently ploughed field. The shapeliness of\r\nthe beautifully chipped piece of flint, almost as translucent at the\r\nedges as horn, the delicate tapering point which, as if by miracle,\r\nhad remained unbroken probably since colonial times, the two curious\r\nlittle \"ears\" carefully formed on each side of the flat triangular base\r\nto facilitate attachment to the head of the arrow, and the thought,\r\nsuggested by older persons, that this weapon might actually have\r\nbeen used in some midnight attack on a white settlement, made more\r\nterrifying by the frightful Mohawk war whoop and the display of the\r\nreeking scalps of human victims in the glare of burning stockade and\r\ncabins--all these things bred a keen desire to learn the particulars\r\nof the history of the red warriors of the Five Nations, the \"Romans of\r\nthe New World,\" and also to know something about the life and customs\r\nof this strange, savage race of mankind which continued to live in an\r\n\"age of stone\" on a continent that had never known civilization. No\r\nvolume like that on the history and development of man in this series\r\nexisted at that time; but if such a book had existed and had fallen\r\ninto the hands of the finder of the arrowhead, it would surely have\r\nfascinated him more than \"Robinson Crusoe\" did, because a boy can\r\ndistinguish as readily as a grown person the superior interest of the\r\ntrue over the pretended, provided that the true possesses the real\r\nelements of romance.\r\n\r\nSo, too, the writer remembers having an interest in mineralogy awakened\r\nin his mind, never to be obliterated, by the sight of another plowed\r\nfield, in the southern skirts of the Adirondack Mountains, whose\r\nfreshly turned furrows glittered in the sunshine with thickly scattered\r\nquartz crystals, some of the larger and more perfect of which blazed\r\nacross, the whole breadth of the field, like huge diamonds, and made\r\nthe heart of the finder beat with an excitement akin to that of the\r\ndiscoverer of a Koh-i-noor. There were also some very curious \"stone\r\nbuttons\" which one could break out with a hammer from slate rocks\r\nalong the Schoharie Creek, and which, when cracked open, were found\r\nto be composed of pyrites that resembled pure silver--and sometimes\r\ngold--freshly broken. Now, things of this sort are always attracting\r\nthe attention and awakening the curiosity of children living in the\r\ncountry, but the real pleasure and instruction that they might afford\r\nare usually missed because of the lack in the family library of\r\npopularly written books on the natural sciences--a lack that we are\r\ntrying to supply.\r\n\r\nFor city children and their elders, whose eyes are constantly greeted,\r\nnot by hills, creeks, ponds, rivers, woods, and fields, but by\r\nsky-aspiring buildings, railroads elevated on stilts, multiple-decked\r\nsuspension bridges, electric power houses, tunnels that form a\r\nsecond city underground, and the thousand marvels and splendors of\r\nelectric illumination at night, the volumes on physics, mechanics,\r\nand electricity and magnetism have a more immediate interest and\r\nvalue. What the children learn about these things in school is far\r\nfrom sufficient to satisfy their curiosity. They need books at home to\r\nguide their inquiries as well as to answer them. Only by that means can\r\nthe diffusion of scientific knowledge, and the popularization of the\r\nscientific method of getting at the truth and the meaning of things\r\nbe thoroughly effected. Science, as its history plainly demonstrates,\r\nprogresses most rapidly only when a great number of minds have been\r\nled to concentrate their powers upon its problems. Great genius, it is\r\ntrue, rides over obstacles; yet consider how much further its energies\r\nmight have carried it if the obstacles had been more or less completely\r\nremoved in advance. Many a young man has been led to a brilliant\r\ncareer, to the great advantage of his country and his time, as a result\r\nof the interest awakened in him by the clear statements of a popularly\r\nwritten book on some branch of science.\r\n\r\nOne of the difficulties that persons unfamiliar with certain branches\r\nof science encounter in reading about them arises from the excessive\r\nuse of technical terms, the lack of simple illustrative examples, and\r\nalso, sometimes, a lack of sympathetic appreciation of the reader's\r\ndifficulties. It has been a special object of this series to avoid this\r\ntrouble. Ordinary textbooks are prepared for students in school and are\r\nintended to be supplemented by the personal instruction and guidance of\r\na teacher, standing at the pupil's elbow, or readily approachable. But\r\nthe reader who wishes to inform himself upon some progressive branch\r\nof science after his school days are over needs to have the teacher\r\nincluded in the book itself.\r\n\r\nThen, too, there are many persons who have no comprehension of the\r\ngreat and gratifying power that a knowledge of some of the elementary\r\nprinciples and formulas of science bestows upon anybody who may take\r\nthe little trouble necessary to master them, a trouble that does not\r\nimply a long course of scientific study. The \"man in the street,\" if he\r\npossesses these easy-working keys to knowledge, can verify for himself\r\nsome of the calculations of scientists which, if he did not know how\r\nthey were done, would always remain for him in the category of the\r\nmysterious achievements of genius.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate, let us take a simple example--that of the Newtonian law\r\nof falling bodies. Many persons would assume on the face of it that\r\nthere was nothing in this law that could have a particular interest\r\nfor them. But let us see. You will find in the volume on physics that\r\nthe law is stated thus: S = ½gt², i. e., \"S equals one-half of the\r\nproduct of g multiplied by t squared.\" As you look at it you would,\r\nperhaps, as soon think of picking up a complicated tool and trying\r\nto use it for some ordinary purpose. Nevertheless, let us try. \"S\"\r\nin the formula means the space or distance traversed by the falling\r\nbody, \"g\" means the velocity that the force of gravity imparts in each\r\nsuccessive second to the body, and \"t\" means the time elapsed during\r\nthe fall. What the formula tells us, then, is that if we observe the\r\ntime during which the body is falling, and then square the number of\r\nseconds involved (multiply the number by itself), multiply this square\r\nby \"g,\" which is represented practically everywhere on the face of the\r\nearth by the number 32, and finally divide the whole by 2, we shall\r\nhave the distance that the body fell. This distance will be in feet,\r\nsince the number 32, representing \"g,\" is in feet. Now, it might be a\r\nmatter of life and death, or at any rate of mental discomfort against\r\nquietude of mind, to have that rule in memory and to be able to apply\r\nit. For instance, you are on your vacation and stopping in a strange\r\nhotel, where they have put you in the top story. On looking out of the\r\nwindow you are dismayed at finding no fire escape, or other appliance\r\nof safety, so that your only resource in case of fire would be to make\r\na rope out of the bedclothes and let yourself down with it. But, how\r\nfar is it to the ground? How long should the rope be? Are there sheets\r\nenough on your bed to furnish it? The little formula about falling\r\nbodies will answer the question for you in five minutes. First, you let\r\nsome small solid object drop from the window, and note by your watch,\r\nor by counting seconds, which everybody ought to teach himself to do,\r\nhow long it takes to reach the ground. You repeat the experiment two or\r\nthree times to make sure. Say the time comes out three seconds. Very\r\nwell, now apply the rule: The square of 3 is 9, and 9 multiplied by 32\r\ngives 288, and dividing by 2 you have 144 feet for the height! It is to\r\nbe feared that your bedclothes rope would not be long enough; you had\r\nbetter send to the office for something to supplement it. But if the\r\ntime of fall should be only 2 seconds, which is more likely, except in\r\nskyscraper hotels, then the calculation would give you 64 feet for the\r\nheight, which you might manage with the aid of the bedclothes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MODELS OF GUTENBERG'S PRINTING PRESSES\r\n\r\nThe models show three stages of development, the first of them at the\r\nright]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BENJAMIN FRANKLIN'S PRINTING PRESS\r\n\r\nThe original is now in the National Museum at Washington]\r\n\r\nThis is only a single example among many that could be given to show\r\nthe usefulness and interest of many of the formulas of science which\r\nthe ordinary reader looks upon as beyond the reach of any person\r\nwhose occupation leads him another way. But cases of equal simplicity\r\ncould be found in connection with the subjects of electricity and\r\nmagnetism, chemistry, medicine, physiology, etc. Sometimes it happens\r\nthat a technical word contains its own definition and explanation in\r\na nutshell. A striking instance of this will be found in astronomy,\r\nin the word \"light-year.\" The meaning of this word stands forth on\r\nits face--it evidently expresses the distance that light travels in\r\nthe course of one year. Now, since it is known by means of direct\r\nmeasurement that light goes at the rate of 186,300 miles per second,\r\nmanifestly a light-year must be equivalent to an enormous number\r\nof miles. In fact that number, roundly stated, is no less than\r\n5,860,000,000,000. But to what marvelous regions of thought such a term\r\nopens the way! Yonder star is 2,000 light-years distant from the earth;\r\nthen its light-waves now entering your eyes left it when Julius Cæsar\r\nwas conquering Gaul, and have been speeding on their way to the earth\r\never since! Another star is found to be 5,000 light-years distant; then\r\nthe light by which you now see it started from the star when Abraham\r\nset out from Ur of the Chaldees to settle in the Holy Land, and has\r\nnot found a resting place anywhere in boundless space until just now\r\nwhen its tiny waves break and expire on the retina of your eye! Such\r\ntreasures of knowledge and tonics to thought are scattered all through\r\nthe volumes of this set, the purpose of whose publishers, editors,\r\nand writers has been to accumulate such things in small compass and\r\nin crystal clearness, for the use not only of those who, after their\r\nschool days are over, still wish to keep abreast of the progress of\r\nscience in all its branches--as everyone should strive to do in this\r\nmost scientific of all ages--but also for those who have hitherto not\r\nhad the time, or the opportunity, or perhaps even the desire, to make\r\nthemselves at home in the house of science.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to add a few words on the interrelation of the different\r\nsubjects treated in the various volumes of the series. This will\r\nsuggest to the reader himself the best order in which to take up the\r\nreading of the books. Naturally he will desire to obtain both a clear\r\ngeneral view of the whole field of science, and also more detailed\r\nacquaintance with its special parts, the amount of detail depending\r\nupon his particular interest in a subject. For the first purpose the\r\npreferable way would be to run first over the brief account that\r\nfollows in this volume, of the history and development of science\r\nin general, and then to take up the simpler and more easily grasped\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nBut it should be firmly kept in mind that, fundamentally, science is\r\none, having in all its branches but one aim and object, viz., the\r\nascertainment and demonstration of the exact truth of things as far\r\nas human capacities are able to reveal and comprehend such truth,\r\nand also but one method of procedure, which is the method of common\r\nsense trained to the utmost attainable exactitude in observation and\r\nthe greatest possible clearness and precision of reasoning. Science\r\nproperly so-called confines itself to things that are subject to\r\nobservation by the senses and to verification by repeated observation\r\nand experiment, while its reasonings and predictions are based entirely\r\nupon the unvarying sequence of the phenomena of nature, as they display\r\nthemselves before us.\r\n\r\nScience is just as one and inseparable as life, or as an organic being,\r\nand its divisions no more imply lack of unity than do the various\r\norgans and limbs of an animal, or a tree, or the different structural\r\nparts of a building. Astronomy is not entirely independent of geology,\r\nnor geology of botany, nor botany of chemistry, nor any of these of\r\nphysics, nor physics of electricity and magnetism, nor the last of\r\nphysiology and medicine. Accordingly the question where to begin in\r\nstudying science is not one that can be answered in the same way for\r\neverybody. But the spirit is the same in all the branches.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the best general indication of the order in which a person who\r\nhas no predilection for any one branch of science should take up the\r\nvarious parts is afforded by their historic development. This was a\r\nresult of the natural reaction of man's mind to its surroundings. The\r\nthings nearest to him, and most immediately important, first attracted\r\nhis attention. The broadest division would be into the science of\r\nthings on the earth's surface; the science of things above the earth,\r\nin the air and the sky; and the science of things within the earth,\r\nconcealed from immediate view.\r\n\r\nIf we take these in their order they naturally subdivide themselves as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\n1--THINGS ON THE EARTH--EXPLAINED BY\r\n\r\n  (a) Anthropology, the Science of Man and His Ancestors, treating of\r\n    his nature, origin, development, division into races and tribes,\r\n    society, industry, etc.\r\n\r\n  (b) Zoölogy, the Science of Animal Life, treating of the \"lower\r\n    animals,\" and of animal life in general as distinguished from the\r\n    kingdom of the plants, although the related science of biology\r\n    deals with both plants and animals, its special subject being the\r\n    phenomena of life in its widest sense.\r\n\r\n  (c) Botany, the Science of Plant Life.\r\n\r\n  (d) Geography, combined with Physiography, the Science of the Face,\r\n    or Superficies, of the Earth, dealing with lands and seas, rivers\r\n    and mountains, political divisions, etc. This is covered in our\r\n    series by the volume on Physiography.\r\n\r\n  (e) In this compartment several branches of science may be grouped,\r\n    since they are all the product of study of things encountered on\r\n    the earth's surface. They are:\r\n\r\n_Physics_, the Science of the Forces of Nature, dealing with the laws\r\nof the inanimate world around us, including the phenomena relating to\r\nsolid, liquid, and gaseous bodies and substances.\r\n\r\n_Chemistry_, the Science of Matter and Its Changes, dealing with the\r\natoms and their constituents, and with the combinations of atoms into\r\nmolecules to form the various chemical elements, etc.\r\n\r\n_Electricity_ and _Magnetism_, the Science of Power, fundamentally\r\nunderlying all other branches, and through its investigation of the\r\nnature of the constituents of atoms--the electrons--going deeper into\r\nthe constitution of things than chemistry itself. In fact this science,\r\nin some respects, blends with chemistry, although it is quite separate\r\nwhen it deals with the mechanical developments of electromagnetism.\r\n\r\n_Medicine_, the Science of Health, _Physiology_, the Science of the\r\nBody, _Psychology_, the Science of Human Behavior, _Mechanics_, the\r\nScience of Machinery, etc., also naturally fall into this category of\r\nThings on the Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n2--THINGS ABOVE THE EARTH--EXPLAINED BY\r\n\r\n  (a) Astronomy, the Science of the Heavenly Bodies.\r\n\r\n  (b) Meteorology, the Science of the Atmosphere, rains, winds,\r\n    storms, fair and foul weather, the changes of the seasons, and\r\n    essentially related to the new and fast developing art of aerial\r\n    navigation.\r\n\r\n\r\n3--THINGS WITHIN THE EARTH--EXPLAINED BY\r\n\r\n  (a) Geology, the Science of the Earth's Crust, or shell; which also\r\n    deals with the various stratifications of the rocks, superposed\r\n    one above another, and containing in the shape of fossils, and\r\n    other marks, a wonderful record of the character and development\r\n    of the living forms that have inhabited the earth during the long\r\n    ages of the past. Of course some of the phenomena dealt with by\r\n    geology are manifest on the earth's surface, and others, like\r\n    volcanoes and earthquakes, hot springs and geysers, are partly\r\n    subterranean and concealed from sight and partly evident by their\r\n    effects on the surface.\r\n\r\n  (b) Closely associated with Geology are Mineralogy, the Science\r\n    of the Constitution and Structure of Rocks and of Mineral and\r\n    Metallic substances; Vulcanology, the Science of Volcanoes, and\r\n    of earth disturbances in general; and the Science of Mining,\r\n    which has several branches, and forms the basis of enormous\r\n    industrial developments.\r\n\r\nIt is manifest, as before said, that the reader must be his own best\r\njudge as to the precise order in which to take up the perusal of\r\nthe volumes in which this immense mass of scientific knowledge is\r\npresented. But, where there is no predisposition to choose one subject\r\nrather than another, or where there is a desire to follow, as nearly as\r\nmay be, the natural line of development of human knowledge, it would\r\nbe well to take first, after the history, the volume on astronomy, a\r\nscience that from the beginning has had a peculiar power to awaken\r\nintellectual curiosity; then that on anthropology; then the various\r\nso-called \"natural history\" subjects, leaving the mechanical and the\r\nmore technical subjects for the last.\r\n\r\nOr, the reader might first take up the subjects of personal importance\r\nto every human being--Medicine, the Science of Health; Physiology, the\r\nScience of the Human Body; Psychology, the Science of the Mind--every\r\none of which is essential to the proper care and preservation of life;\r\nand afterward study the other branches in the order already suggested.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ~Garrett P. Serviss~]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF SCIENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe romantic history of science shows how the discoveries of the\r\ngreatest human minds, slowly operating since the remotest times, have\r\nmade possible our present-day civilization. Few studies are worthy of\r\ngreater attention; no other department of knowledge affords more real\r\npleasure. Whoever clearly understands the history of science possesses\r\nintellectual advantages over those who are ignorant of the causes\r\nthat have led to the establishment of the basic principles of our\r\nmodern industrial arts and applied sciences. Standards of comparison\r\nare furnished by the history of science which illuminate many of the\r\nwonders of to-day, develop alertness of mind, and afford a never-ending\r\ntrain of suggestions for thought.\r\n\r\nThe term science means knowledge. It was derived from the language\r\nof the Romans. It is well to have a clear idea of the meaning of the\r\nword. Everyone knows that it has to do with certain kinds of knowledge;\r\nfew know the particular kinds it embraces. It does not mean the mere\r\nknowledge of a single fact. It does not mean a knowledge of something\r\nwhich has to be done. Long before science was born, our early ancestors\r\nobserved many isolated physical, philosophical, and religious facts.\r\nThey knew that day followed night, that the stars moved, that every day\r\nthe sun progressed over the arch of the heavens. Such facts did not\r\nconstitute science.\r\n\r\nWhat we know as science began when man commenced to compare one fact\r\nwith another, to classify phenomena, and to arrange his knowledge\r\nsystematically. Order, method, system, are basic principles of science.\r\nThe best description would, therefore, appear to be systematized\r\nknowledge of any kind which had been gained and verified by exact\r\nobservation and correct thinking. The whole field of human knowledge is\r\nnow methodically formulated and arranged into rational systems. Modern\r\nscience may, therefore, be said to embrace all our exact knowledge. Its\r\nprovince is enormous; its subdivisions are limitless.\r\n\r\nScience takes no account of knowledge which is not exact. Many people\r\nacquire valuable information which they profitably use in business, but\r\nwhich they are unable to communicate or describe to others because they\r\ndo not actually understand it.\r\n\r\nFarmers and flower growers often possess important practical knowledge\r\nof facts which are embraced by the principles of the sciences of\r\nagriculture, botany, and biology. But their practical knowledge is\r\nnot true science. It is rather like an artist's intuitive impulse. It\r\nis not the result of scientific analysis, and there is no tangible,\r\ncommunicable residuum.\r\n\r\nThere could be no science if men did not discover principles of\r\nknowledge which can be communicated to, and made available for use\r\nby others. Scientific knowledge must be stripped of all traces of\r\nemotionalism and personal convictions. True science is, therefore,\r\ndepersonalized knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe history of science shows how our exact knowledge has been developed\r\nalong irregular paths but with progressive advances. There have been\r\nlong periods during which little apparent progress was accomplished,\r\nwhich have been succeeded by others made memorable by brilliant\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\nWe must constantly bear in mind that many of the truths generally\r\naccepted to-day were doubtful or novel theories at some previous\r\nperiod. The history of science shows the enormous mental effort\r\nexpended in testing and developing what now appear to us as commonplace\r\ntruths.\r\n\r\nBasic principles like those of algebra, geometry, and the planetary\r\nmotions were tested during several thousand years before they were\r\nfinally accepted as true.\r\n\r\nThe human intellect at the dawn of history was similar to what it is\r\nto-day. But it was not exercised as we exercise ours because it did\r\nnot have adequate materials and opportunities. For the same reason\r\nscience made slower progress in early times than it does now. Progress\r\nis cumulative. Each advance helps that which follows. The functions of\r\na scientist are to struggle against individual views, and to provide an\r\nexplanation of phenomena which may be accepted as true by other minds.\r\nAscertained facts must be classified and then sequence and significance\r\nrecognized from an unbiased viewpoint.\r\n\r\nThe history of science is the written record of countless experiments,\r\ntheories, and experiences of mankind which have been submitted to the\r\ntests of scientific methods.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that science embraces all knowledge its real scope is\r\nlimited to knowledge which is reducible to laws and can be embodied in\r\nsystems. The human mind unites all knowledge by a single thread, but\r\nwe have to chart and map it into larger and smaller divisions which we\r\ndefine by the methods, basic concepts, and plans used in developing\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWe may now see how it is that the boundaries of any science are\r\nmerely approximate. The general grouping of the sciences is likewise\r\napproximate. The first large group includes the abstract, or formal,\r\nsciences such as mathematics and logic. The other great group comprises\r\nthe concrete sciences dealing with phenomena as contrasted with formal\r\nrelationships. Chemistry, biology, physics, psychology, and sociology\r\nbelong to the concrete group.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of history man is discovered observing the great\r\nphenomena of Nature and struggling to learn their laws and to explain\r\nthem. Religion is both emotional and intellectual, and through these\r\nqualities it attracted primitive man while he was attempting to gather\r\nlight on the riddles of the world. It was through religion that science\r\nwas born.\r\n\r\nRecent researches into primitive beliefs have shown in a surprising\r\nmanner the psychological unity of man. In all parts of the world, in\r\nall periods of history, and under all conditions, the minds of men, in\r\ntheir natural reactions against the basic factors of existence, operate\r\nin similar ways. There is a remarkable resemblance in the mental\r\nprocesses of men. The laws of thought appear to work automatically\r\nin all men. The minds of prehistoric people worked like those of men\r\nto-day. The impressions of the senses appear to be interpreted in\r\nsimilar ways by all peoples. Here is the explanation of the numerous\r\nresemblances we find in national histories, national folk lore, and\r\nnational religions. They differ much in innumerable details, but\r\npossess many resemblances in their great fundamental conceptions.\r\nNormal man has always been religious. Mankind has always assumed\r\ndefinite attitudes toward the universe and this has resulted in the\r\nuniversality of religion.\r\n\r\nEarly men the world over appear to have been as eager to learn the keys\r\nto the riddles of the universe as was the boy Longfellow sang about in\r\nthe following stanzas:\r\n\r\n    Nature, the old nurse, took\r\n    The child upon her knee,\r\n    Saying: \"Here is a story-book\r\n    Thy Father has written for thee.\"\r\n\r\n    \"Come wander with me,\" she said,\r\n    \"Into regions yet untrod;\r\n    And read what is still unread\r\n    In the manuscripts of God.\"\r\n\r\n    And he wandered away and away\r\n    With Nature, the dear old nurse,\r\n    Who sang to him night and day\r\n    The rhymes of the universe.\r\n\r\n    And whenever the way seemed long,\r\n    Or his heart began to fail,\r\n    She would sing a more wonderful song,\r\n    Or tell a more marvelous tale.\r\n\r\nModern science has developed from this instinctive human desire to read\r\nNature's story-book and understand her marvelous tales.\r\n\r\nEarly struggles of mankind taught that human behavior must be regulated\r\nin accordance with rigid moral laws. This promoted the primitive social\r\nprocesses which were early concerned with religious beliefs as well\r\nas with magic and medicine. Two of the earliest beliefs universally\r\naccepted were that we possess souls and that our personality persists\r\nafter death. These basic principles of faith have caused extremely\r\nbeneficial results to follow in the development of knowledge.\r\n\r\nSome of the American Indians and other primitive peoples of to-day\r\nstill live in the belief that the heavenly bodies, the sky, sea, and\r\nearth, as well as plants, animals, and men, all belong to a vast\r\nsystem of all-conscious and interrelated life, in which the degrees of\r\nrelationship are distinguished by the degrees of resemblance.\r\n\r\nReligious beliefs were developed from struggles to conceive the\r\ninconceivable and discover the infinite. Religions led to studies of\r\nmysteries and ceremonies and rites. Magic developed and this also\r\nhad its customs, dogmas, and rites. The difference between magic and\r\nreligion was that the magician was consulted by his personal friends,\r\nwhereas the holders of religious beliefs had a common bond uniting\r\nthem in one strict form of worship. Magic was not systematized, while\r\nreligion was a unified system of beliefs and practices relative to\r\nsacred things, and chiefly to the regulation of moral concepts and\r\nconduct.\r\n\r\nThe intimate association of religion, magic, necromancy, and science\r\ncontinued until the early Greek era. There were many temples erected\r\nin Greece and dedicated to Æsculapius, the god of medicine. Cures were\r\nbelieved to be effected through the valuable offerings made to the god\r\nby patients and their friends. It was thought that the ways to health\r\nwould be indicated to them by the god through dreams.\r\n\r\nRecent investigations of the representative ceremonial rites of the\r\naboriginal peoples of Australasia and of North and South America\r\nhave yielded a remarkably rich fund of information on the causes and\r\nconditions which operated in prehistoric eras in developing the mental,\r\nmoral, and physical sciences.\r\n\r\nSome of the most romantic stories ever developed by the human intellect\r\nare to be found in recent scientific works dealing with the history and\r\nprinciples of the tribal customs, ceremonies, and religious rites of\r\nprimitive peoples. The early chapters in the history of man's mental\r\ndevelopment and the evolution of science from distant origins in mystic\r\nforces, through magic and necromancy to religion and philosophy, must\r\ngive abundant pleasure to all thoughtful persons by showing how it\r\ncame that the high state of civilization now attained was brought\r\nabout by slow processes, operating through immense periods of time and\r\nblossoming only during the past two or three thousand years. A study\r\nof these stories cannot fail to show how intimately science has been\r\nassociated with religion, why every normal individual is essentially\r\nreligious, and why the continuation of our civilization, and the\r\nvery existence of the human race, are absolutely contingent upon the\r\nrecognition of the moral laws, in the future as in the past. The\r\nhistory of science establishes the fact that moral sanctions, which\r\nrequire religious ceremonies to keep them vital, are the essential\r\nbases of human progress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nPRIMITIVE MAN AND EARLY CIVILIZATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe development of scientific history has not followed a uniform\r\ncourse. Progress has been rhythmic. There has been always a reaction\r\ncoming in the steps of brilliant discoveries. Periods of feverish\r\nexperimental activities have been succeeded by others during which\r\nlittle apparent progress was made.\r\n\r\nSuch dull intervals seem to have been necessary for developing,\r\nformulating, classifying, and testing the innumerable details and\r\ninferences that the discoveries of the active periods produced.\r\n\r\nWhile mankind in general has contributed to the total of our\r\nintellectual treasures, some races have been more active in this way\r\nthan others. For this reason it is advisable to briefly survey the more\r\nrecent discoveries about the ancestors of existing peoples.\r\n\r\nIndo-Malaysia, parts of central Asia, and the valleys of the Tigris and\r\nEuphrates rivers in Mesopotamia are variously credited with having been\r\nthe cradle of the human race. It should be understood, however, that we\r\nare only permitted to speak authoritatively of existing races, because\r\nthe land forms of the earth have undergone such remarkable changes\r\nthat we can know little definitely about the earlier periods of human\r\nhistory. For the purposes of the history of science, while bearing in\r\nmind these qualifying suggestions, we may accept the statement that\r\nman's ancestors originated in proximity to India.\r\n\r\nIt was around the waters of the Persian Gulf that the earliest known\r\ncivilizations arose. The people who founded them came from central\r\nAsia. They had reached a considerable degree of culture, which suggests\r\nthat they themselves came from earlier centers of civilization.\r\n\r\nThe study of prehistoric antiquity is termed archæology. Its principal\r\nperiods have been divided, for convenience, into the Stone, Bronze, and\r\nIron Ages. Each of these is distinguished by the substances used for\r\ntools. In the Stone Age men used stone spearheads, arrows, and knives,\r\nwhereas in the Iron Age similar things were made of iron or copper.\r\n\r\nThe science of mankind is known as Anthropology. It deals with the\r\ninnumerable steps in the evolution of mankind from remote periods, and\r\nwith the primitive development of the arts, sciences, and religion. Yet\r\nit is one of the youngest of the sciences.\r\n\r\nOne of its essential teachings is that heredity and racial\r\npredispositions play, and always have played, more important parts\r\nin man's evolution, and in the development of civilization, than\r\nenvironment and education.\r\n\r\nHereditary tendencies, such as the religious, moral, and æsthetic\r\ninstincts have been indispensable in preserving and developing all the\r\nraces of mankind.\r\n\r\nMoral discipline has been the chief factor in self-control, and\r\ntherefore in civilization. It is because the moral sense has\r\nproved so beneficial to the human race, and is the most powerful of\r\nour instinctive desires, that mankind always has been and must be\r\nreligious. It controls man's knowledge, desires, and will, and has\r\ndominated the race since our early ancestors began to think.\r\n\r\nWhen we recognize this fact we can readily see that anything which\r\ntends to oppose the moral or ethical sanctions, or detract from\r\nreligious beliefs, is injurious to civilization and human progress. The\r\nhistories of religion, ethics, and æsthetics plainly develop the rôles\r\nwhich have been played by moral self-discipline in the protection and\r\ndevelopment of mankind, as well as of knowledge and science.\r\n\r\nThe moral control of individuals acts also upon society generally,\r\nand upon whole racial and national groups. The ethical ideals assist\r\neach individual mind to realize its own end and at the same time tend\r\nto influence the tribal and social mind to attain a common end. This\r\ngreat moral, instinctive force, which has played such an immensely\r\nvaluable part in developing civilization and science, is known as the\r\nhuman social and national conscience. It acts both individually and\r\ncollectively.\r\n\r\nEuropean races have been divided into classes corresponding to the\r\nprevailing cephalic indices. The longheads are grouped as the Nordic,\r\nor Baltic, subspecies, because they were formerly numerous around\r\nthe Baltic countries. People of this group are distinguished by tall\r\nstatures, fair skin and hair, good physique, and light colored eyes.\r\nThese peoples include the Scandinavians, Anglo-Saxon, and certain\r\nimportant Teutonic groups, as well as Asiatic peoples who are known as\r\nthe Aryans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                               Copyright, Ewing Galloway\r\n\r\nMODEL OF THE SAILING VESSEL \"SANTA MARIA,\" THE FLAGSHIP OF COLUMBUS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CURTISS NAVY RACER, THE AIRPLANE THAT WON THE PULITZER\r\nRACE OF 1921]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. ARMY DIRIGIBLE ON A TRANSCONTINENTAL FLIGHT]\r\n\r\nThe most important rôles in the development of modern civilization,\r\nart, industry, and science have been played by representatives of the\r\nNordics.\r\n\r\nThe Iberian, or Mediterranean, subspecies, ranks next in importance.\r\nThe peoples of this great racial division originally occupied the\r\ncountries between the northern Atlantic coast of Africa and the\r\nconfines of the areas of the Nordics around the northern provinces of\r\nFrance. They spread down the Mediterranean and over large areas in\r\nAsia. Their skulls are long, but differ from those of the Nordics in\r\ntheir absolute size. Their stature is lower, and weaker than that of\r\nthe Nordics, while their hair, eyes, and skin are dark or black. The\r\nWelsh, the Moors, and the early Greeks are chiefly classed with the\r\nMediterranean group. The Carthaginians, Phœnicians, Egyptians, and\r\nEtrurians were members of it.\r\n\r\nThe roundheads comprise the Alpine subspecies. This is the strongest\r\nnumerical group to-day. It is characterized by small round heads, short\r\nbodies, dark hair, and dark eyes. It is of Asiatic origin and includes\r\nthe Slavs, modern Greeks, Italians, Germans, Austrians, Swiss, the\r\npre-Nordic Irish, French, and Belgians. The first Alpine invasion of\r\nEurope began about 10,000 B. C. There were many subsequent ones through\r\nthe plateaus of Asia Minor, the Balkans, and valley of the Danube. They\r\nreached England about 1800 B. C., and formed small colonies in Ireland,\r\nthe descendants of which now call themselves Celts and are clearly\r\ndistinguished by the characteristic Alpine indices. This race is now\r\nso well acclimatized in Europe that most of its Asiatic traces have\r\nbeen lost, and its round skulls and dark eyes and hair are the only\r\nreminders of its Mongolian origin.\r\n\r\nMembers of each of these three great racial groups of mankind have\r\nthroughout the ages contributed to the development of the sciences and\r\narts. The Nordics began to appear in European history as agricultural\r\ntribes, speaking Aryan languages, like Celtic and Welsh, who swept\r\ndown from the north and pushed the earlier settlers back through their\r\nirresistible arms, which were made of bronze and later of iron. The\r\nearlier settlers were still furnished with arms and implements of the\r\nStone Age.\r\n\r\nThere was a much older intellectual people than the Nordics settled in\r\nEurope. The people of this race, about whom we have learned through\r\nrecent archæological researches, are known as the Cro-Magnons. They\r\nlived between 25,000 and 10,000 B. C. Their skulls were distinguished\r\nfrom those of the Nordics by their pronounced cheek-bones and broad\r\nfaces. Their culture, as their favorable cephalic index would suggest,\r\nwas of a high character. Numerous drawings and art works of theirs,\r\nwhich have been preserved, place them among the world's superior\r\npeoples.\r\n\r\nSoon after the settlement of the Cro-Magnons in Europe, and their\r\nintermarriage with the earlier settlers, their physical development\r\nand stature began to decline. They were finally absorbed and destroyed\r\nby the inferior peoples among whom they dwelled. Their disappearance,\r\nlike that of the ancient Greeks, who appear to have been the most\r\nintellectual people the world ever produced, shows how the upward\r\ndevelopment of human physical and intellectual qualities is constantly\r\ninjured by the contacts of superior and inferior races.\r\n\r\nThe scientific discoveries made prior to the Iron Age, or about 2000\r\nB. C., were not numerous. The struggle for life was so intense that\r\nfew had opportunity for contemplation and philosophic reflection. It\r\nwas subsequent to the discovery of the basic principles of metallurgy,\r\nin the Iron Age, that science began rapidly to advance. The benefits\r\nbestowed upon mankind by the employment of metals reduced the sharpness\r\nof life's struggles, permitted and instigated reflection, and provided\r\nmeans for experimentation.\r\n\r\nModern history begins with the peoples of Mesopotamia. There were\r\ncultured peoples east of the Tigris and Euphrates, in Persia, India,\r\nMongolia, Tartary, and China before the founding of Babylon. But we are\r\nmore instructed about the Babylonians and Assyrians than about earlier\r\nAsiatic races.\r\n\r\nThe Babylonians and Assyrians appear to have originated in central\r\nAsia and to have migrated to Arabia about 10,000 B. C., and perhaps\r\nearlier. They were well settled in Arabia before the Egyptian pyramids\r\nand other Semitic memorials were planned. They brought with them from\r\nthe farthest Orient many important contributions to civilization and\r\nculture, and developed many others.\r\n\r\nThese were religious, philosophical and keen commercial peoples.\r\nThey shaped the organization of modern religions. The Babylonians\r\nreduced the world of gods to a single system with classifications\r\ndistinguishing between major and minor deities, and between those of\r\nheavenly, or stellar, and earthly habitats, and those of time and\r\nspace. They developed many religious myths of the Creation, the\r\nFlood, Paradise, and others which were subsequently embraced by other\r\nreligions.\r\n\r\nBoth the Babylonians and Assyrians composed beautiful hymns, prayers,\r\nparables, and religious tales, and had numerous elaborate religious\r\ncustoms, rituals, ceremonies, and festivals conducted by priests, nuns,\r\nand acolytes.\r\n\r\nAnu, or Anum, the God of Heaven, was the principal Babylonian deity,\r\nwhile Ashur was the leading god of the Assyrians.\r\n\r\nReligious studies and rites occupied a large portion of the time\r\nof these peoples and, consequently, their temples, monasteries,\r\nschools, and other religious buildings were large and numerous.\r\nTheir architecture was elaborately artistic. This was one of their\r\nincentives to scientific invention. They made important discoveries in\r\nall the basic physical sciences, like chemistry, physics, metallurgy,\r\nand mathematics, to enable them to improve their buildings and to\r\nembellish them with paintings, pictorial tiles, and fancy metals and\r\ntextiles. They had excellent professional men, artists, jurists,\r\nbankers, contractors, and scientists. They were fond of literature and\r\nfounded extensive libraries. Music and musical instruments were very\r\npopular with them. Their cuneiform writings, as disclosed by numerous\r\nbeautiful stone and porcelain tablets which have come down to us, were\r\nexcellently done.\r\n\r\nThe fragments of literature, laws, and religious policies that we are\r\nacquainted with indicate that the numerous Babylonian and Assyrian\r\nsettlements in each great empire possessed social and political\r\nconditions similar to those of our days. Science and art were then\r\nsufficiently advanced to enable these ancient people to live as\r\nagreeable, moral, and legally secure lives as those of any subsequent\r\npeoples.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese appear to have been making similar progress to that of\r\nthe Babylonians about the same period. It would seem that both these\r\npeoples were in contact with a similar but earlier cultured race in\r\ncentral Asia. Although the early Chinese were a religious people, they\r\nappear to have been more philosophical than the Babylonians. This\r\nenabled them to make further progress in the abstract sciences. In\r\nsubsequent years they made rapid strides in the physical sciences, as\r\nwill be shown later.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians came into prominence toward the end of the Babylonian\r\nand Assyrian empires, and for many centuries played a great rôle in\r\ndeveloping civilization. The numerous benefits which they bestowed\r\nupon the world by their researches in science and art are not fully\r\nappreciated.\r\n\r\nEarly history pictures two great Asiatic races struggling for supremacy\r\nin India. They were the Aryans, a fair-skinned people, and the\r\nDravidians, a colored people. The Aryans succeeded in displacing the\r\nDravidians in the great plains, upon which they settled and developed\r\nlarge cities, important world commerce, and contributed great art works\r\nand scientific and philosophical discoveries to the world's stores. The\r\nDravidians retired to the hill country, where their representatives\r\nstill live.\r\n\r\nThe minds of the various Indian peoples have always been strongly\r\nphilosophical. This led them to the development of numerous religious\r\nsects and philosophical systems, and they made important mathematical\r\ndiscoveries. While the scientific bent of the ancient Greeks was of a\r\nconcrete nature, which tended toward geometrical proofs for scientific\r\nproblems, that of the ancient peoples of India was toward numerical\r\nsymbolism and arithmetical proofs. We find that when the Greeks were\r\ndeveloping geometry the Indians were contributing to arithmetic and\r\nalgebra.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese closely resembled the ancient Indians in the philosophical\r\ntendency of their minds; but, owing perhaps to the different conditions\r\nunder which they lived, they were more concrete in their ideas. They\r\nalso made progress in mathematics and developed medicine, chemistry,\r\nmetallurgy, and many of the sciences which were applied to commercial\r\nand industrial uses. The progress made in mathematics in China was\r\ntransmitted to Egypt, and therefore to Europe, through India. Among\r\nearly Chinese discoveries in mathematics were methods of solving\r\nnumerical equations and the development of magic squares and circles,\r\nwhich gave a great stimulus to studies in geometry and astronomy.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs, Greeks, and Romans took up the discoveries of the Asiatic\r\npeoples, and the Egyptians enlarged them and passed them forward to\r\nus. The Arabs solved cubic equations by geometrical means, perfected\r\nthe basic principles of trigonometry, and made great advances in\r\nmathematics, physics, chemistry, and astronomy.\r\n\r\nA survey of the early history of science indicates that from the\r\nremotest period man was engaged in grappling with the great principle\r\nof causation. Progress was necessarily slow at first on account of the\r\nscarcity of tested data. Then it became more rapid. Soon after the\r\nfounding of the great city of Babylon we find that the Babylonians were\r\npossessed of enough knowledge of the arts and sciences to enable them\r\nto become world traders and great industrial undertakers. They built\r\nmany cities and lived highly civilized lives. The history of modern\r\nscience may very properly be dated from the building of Babylon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPRE-BABYLONIAN SCIENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe transcending wonders of the phenomena of the heavenly bodies\r\nattracted the attention of primitive man at an early period of his\r\nintellectual development. The succession of day and night, the phases\r\nof the moon, comets, meteorites, the eclipses of sun and moon, the\r\nrecurrence of the seasons were observed and recorded. In this way,\r\nthrough long uncivilized times, many scientific facts were noticed and\r\nhanded down by tradition, and probably were among the first scientific\r\ndata collected. We have no means of determining when the primitive\r\nscience of astronomy became systematized, although there are reasons\r\nfor believing that it was roughly outlined at a remote date.\r\n\r\nThere was a tradition among the Babylonian priests that their\r\nastronomical observations and records went back to a period of more\r\nthan 400,000 years. This statement was believed by the people of\r\nantiquity, and was made to Alexander the Great during his Indian\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nAstronomy appears to have been developed into an organized system by\r\nthe primitive peoples of central Asia. It was carried to China, India,\r\nand Arabia by learned travelers. There were government astronomers in\r\nChina before the year 3000 B. C., and history records that two of these\r\nofficials, named Ho and Hi, were beheaded in the year 2159 B. C. for\r\nbeing careless in their work and failing to issue a timely prediction\r\nof a solar eclipse.\r\n\r\nChinese history also relates that the Emperor, in 2857 B. C., issued\r\nan edict recommending the study of astronomy. From these and other\r\nhistorical references we learn that nearly 5,000 years ago astronomical\r\nscience was not only well developed, but that its educational value was\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\nWhile attention was being given to the study of astronomy in China,\r\nthis science was independently developed in India. The astronomers\r\nof India invented a different system from that of the Chinese, and\r\ncompiled numerous astronomical tables which were published and widely\r\nused as far back as 3102 B. C.\r\n\r\nThese early astronomical studies resulted in the division of time\r\npractically as we know it to-day. The Babylonians had a week of seven\r\ndays. The days bore names of the planets and were divided into hours\r\nand minutes. Days were combined into months and years. The Babylonian\r\nand Chaldean astronomers, like those of China and India, were important\r\nmen and were credited with great learning.\r\n\r\nThe Babylonian month began on the evening when a new moon was first\r\nobserved. An adjustment was made necessary between the months, owing\r\nto the fact that the actual lunar interval is about twenty-nine and\r\na fraction days. Numerous astrological observations were made with\r\nthe view of obtaining data to facilitate the monthly adjustments. The\r\ntaking of these observations was made easier by maps of the heavens\r\nwhich were recorded on baked clay tablets and prisms. Similar maps of\r\nthe world, with positions fixed by astronomical observations, were\r\nlikewise made in Babylonian times.\r\n\r\nThe usefulness of astronomical observations and predictions led to the\r\nbelief that they could be employed with advantage for wider purposes.\r\nThe astrologers endeavored to deduce omens and forecast horoscopes.\r\nIn order to facilitate their calculations, the astrologers invented\r\ncalculating and time-dividing machines. Tablets from the royal library\r\nat Nineveh indicate that Chaldean astrologers possessed mechanisms\r\nwhich divided the hours of the day by mechanical means. These were\r\nforerunners of modern clocks and timepieces.\r\n\r\nThese early scientists represented the earth as a vast circular plain,\r\nintersected by high mountain ranges and surrounded by a large river,\r\nwith other mountain chains which lost themselves in an infinite ocean.\r\nThe heavenly vault was believed to be supported by the highest peaks\r\nof the outlying mountains. It was owing to the peculiar nature of this\r\ncosmogony that the pre-Babylonians and Babylonians were unable to\r\ndevelop a satisfactory mechanical view of the world. The world had to\r\nwait for an adequate mechanical theory before general knowledge could\r\nbe advanced, so that men like Newton and Laplace could correct the\r\nerrors of early theories and furnish a sound working hypothesis.\r\n\r\nThe advancement of science requires methodical observations and the\r\nuse of the highest powers of the imagination. It is thinking in\r\npicture-like figures that supplies primitive reasoning. While pure\r\nreasoning deals with abstract, verbal images, the more concrete\r\npicture-thinking deals with object-images. The differences between\r\nthinkers and dreamers is chiefly in the way their minds act. But even\r\nthinkers are supplied with thought material by the elementary mental\r\noperation of picture-thought, dreams, or dream-thinking. Science needs\r\nthe active use of the imagination to anticipate experience and suggest\r\nthe issues of a process in course of action. Most great inventions,\r\nand probably all primitive inventions, were stimulated by imagination.\r\nBut the imagination, unless skillfully directed, is liable to numerous\r\nerrors. That is why in all ages there has been much error in connection\r\nwith knowledge. There could, however, be little or no progress without\r\nimaginative work. It is only within very recent years that the modern\r\nsciences have been stripped of much absurd matter derived from crude\r\nimaginative work. When we bear this in mind, we have the key to the\r\npart played by ancient myths, magic, and ceremonies in developing\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThe term magic is derived from the Persian term for priest. The magi,\r\nor priests of Zoroaster, their religion, learning, and occult practices\r\nhad important world-wide effects just before the Babylonian era. Magic\r\nis a pioneer of religion, philosophy, and science.\r\n\r\nMedicine was benefited, in some ways, by the priests seeking means for\r\ndealing with the work of the spirits of evil. Chemistry and metallurgy\r\nwere also advanced, and new realms of knowledge were opened even by\r\nmagicians.\r\n\r\nThe magic of the Babylonians survived their empire. It was handed over\r\nto the Egyptians and contemporary peoples, and was in turn passed\r\ndown to the magicians and alchemists of the Middle Ages, and to the\r\ndramatists, poets, and novelists of all ages.\r\n\r\nThe accumulation of scientific facts was greatly facilitated by the\r\nimprovements made by the Babylonians in the manufacture of earthenware\r\ntablets, scrolls, and prisms. Beautifully drawn cuneiform picture signs\r\nrecorded on these all the knowledge of the day. These stonelike records\r\nwere filed away in many monasteries and libraries. Subsequently,\r\nletters were invented, alphabets were formed, and writing displaced the\r\nhieroglyphic symbols.\r\n\r\nThe invention of alphabets made reading easier. This resulted in giving\r\nan impetus to education which has had cumulative effects right down\r\nthrough the ages.\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to realize why scientific discoveries were\r\nmade very slowly, and at long intervals apart, in early times. Facts\r\nhad to be accumulated, studied, grouped, and compared. Accounts of\r\nthese studies had to be pictured and stored away for future use. Only\r\nexceptionally learned men did this. But when alphabets were invented\r\nand education increased, numerous minds became active and there was\r\na great extension of thought, experimentation, and philosophical\r\ncontemplation. This was followed by the establishment of new religious\r\nhouses, schools, and philosophical academies, at all of which the\r\nablest men of the day emulated the scholars in formulating theories and\r\nmaking inventions.\r\n\r\nSoon after the perfecting of cuneiform writing in Babylon, characters\r\nwere devised for representing numbers. A vertical, arrowlike wedge\r\nrepresented the figure 1, while a horizontal wedge stood for 10.\r\nA vertical and horizontal wedge, placed together, signified 100.\r\nOther arrangements of these characters meant that they were to be\r\nmultiplied, subtracted, divided, or added together. In this simple\r\nmanner all kinds of arithmetical results could be recorded.\r\n\r\nThe Babylonian mathematicians were familiar with decimals, integers,\r\nand fractions, and their tables and records of astronomical and\r\nengineering calculations reveal a remarkably high degree of\r\nmathematical ability, indicating that peoples who preceded us by\r\nseveral thousands of years were familiar with the more important\r\ncalculations requisite in trade and industry as well as for\r\nastrological computations.\r\n\r\nBabylon was a great world metropolis. It occupied a position similar\r\nto that occupied by London to-day. Its merchants were engaged in\r\nworld-wide commercial operations which needed good systems of\r\nbookkeeping and accountancy. These, in turn, presupposed a highly\r\ndeveloped arithmetical system. Practically all the arithmetical\r\ncalculations used in commerce to-day were employed by them. Their\r\naccountants, like those of China to-day, used the abacus, or\r\ncalculating machine.\r\n\r\nA lucid illustration of the accuracy of ancient calculations, the\r\nefficiency of their reports, and the confidence with which they\r\nexecuted intellectual duties is afforded by the following translation\r\nof a Babylonian astronomer's official report:\r\n\r\n\"To the King, my lord, thy faithful servant, Mar-Istar.\r\n\r\n  \"... On the first day, as the new moon's day of the month of\r\n  Thammuz declined, the moon again became visible over the planet\r\n  Mercury, as I previously had predicted that it would to my master\r\n  the King. My calculations were accurate.\"\r\n\r\nThe records of Babylon furnish us with a wealth of documents of this\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe numerous peoples of India have always been divided into castes.\r\nThis has resulted in the pioneering work in science falling to\r\nthe priests. However, the principal priests were among the most\r\nintellectual men of each generation and, as they traveled in search\r\nof instruction, India was always in contact with the progress made in\r\nChina, central Asia, and Babylonia. These great centers of ancient\r\nlearning progressed together.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were able mathematicians and discovered and developed at an\r\nearly period what is now known as \"Arabic notation.\" In this work they\r\nwere assisted by the Babylonians.\r\n\r\nThe Indians, like the Chinese and Babylonians, solved problems in\r\ninterest, discounts, partnership, the summation of arithmetical and\r\ngeometrical series, and determined number changes in combinations and\r\npermutations with ease. They were also proficient in algebra, the\r\nextraction of the roots of numbers, various classes of equations, and\r\nthe principles of trigonometry.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese have always been good mathematicians. It is probably due\r\nto this fact that they have at all times been such able traders and\r\nbankers.\r\n\r\nWe are not so familiar with the works of Chinese mathematicians in\r\npre-Babylonian times as we are with the Indian; but the references of\r\ncontemporary writers indicate that the Chinese scientists were as able\r\nand active as their contemporaries.\r\n\r\nWe have remarked the high degree of perfection which was attained in\r\nthe Babylonian era by scholars in science and mathematics. Similar\r\nperfection was attained in art, industry, law, and medicine. The\r\nwonderful law work that has come down to us under the name of the code\r\nof Hammurabi indicates not only the extensive progress which had been\r\nmade in law, but incidentally through its references the progress of\r\nagriculture, industry, commerce, and business.\r\n\r\nMany references in the Hammurabic code, written about 2300 B. C.,\r\nshow that the medical profession had attained considerable advance\r\nin Babylon. Surgeons were daring operators. They commonly performed\r\noperations for cataract. Many of the common major operations now\r\nperformed by surgeons were also done by the ancients. They were experts\r\nat setting fractured bones. The physicians made effective use of drugs.\r\nMany drugs employed to-day were known to them.\r\n\r\nThe discoveries of the early oriental nations were collected and\r\ndeveloped in Babylon. The entire fields of science, mathematics,\r\ngeometry, agriculture, astronomy, philosophy, and art were focused in\r\nBabylon and handed down to the Egyptians and the Greeks. Much credit\r\nthat is given to ancient Greece should be shared also by Babylon.\r\nIt was from Babylon that Greece obtained the principles of its\r\ncivilization, arts and sciences. Even Greek architecture and sculpture\r\nwere originally derived from Babylon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nEGYPTIAN SCIENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early civilization in Egypt developed in the ancient cities of\r\nThebes and Memphis. Authorities on the dawn of history in Egypt are\r\nunable to definitely account for the origins of the various peoples\r\nwho have ruled the land. One school contends that the early negroid\r\ninhabitants originated in Africa. Another school opposes this view and\r\nsuggests an Asiatic origin. Each of these schools can marshal facts to\r\nsustain its contentions. The truth is that Africa was inhabited at such\r\nan early period that we are unable to fully trace back the movements of\r\nits races.\r\n\r\nMan was divided into species and subspecies at a very remote period.\r\nThe dominant peoples in each country, in each era, were the successful\r\ncontestants in long conflicts for supremacy. Many races have vanished\r\nwithout leaving any traces beyond reversional strains which still\r\ncome to the surface at times in families living to-day. The laws of\r\nevolution, only recently deciphered, are the sole means we possess for\r\nlearning about many of the long-perished species of men.\r\n\r\nA few races, too weak to ever gain supremacy and themselves to occupy\r\ndistricts, or countries, have survived by dwelling among stronger\r\nraces. The Ainus, in Japan, and the Jews in Asia and Europe, are\r\nwell-known examples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MODEL OF AN EARLY ELECTRIC MOTOR\r\n\r\nThe original was invented by M. H. Jacobi in 1834 and was used in 1838\r\nto propel a boat on the Neva at St. Petersburg.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MODEL OF AN EARLY TURNING LATHE\r\n\r\nThis mechanism was invented by Thomas Blanchard in 1843.

Many peoples have lived and ruled there and passed\r\non before incoming tides of new and more vigorous peoples. Each race,\r\nundoubtedly, during its residence in Egypt contributed to the general\r\nfund of Egyptian knowledge and customs and assisted in the development\r\nof science.\r\n\r\nThe tombs of Thebes have given us bodies of ancient Egyptians of more\r\nthan six thousand years ago. At that time the people were characterized\r\nby the Grecian type of profile. They resembled the contemporary\r\nactive peoples in India and Arabia and did not differ much from the\r\nEgyptians of our day. The incoming streams of people who settled in the\r\nNile valley, both Asiatic and negroid, changed the appearance of the\r\nEgyptians at different times by intermarriage, but when their vigor\r\nwaned and they were crowded out by other peoples, the Egyptians assumed\r\ntheir regular Semitic characteristics.\r\n\r\nEgyptian history really begins with the old kingdom dynasties, about\r\nten thousand years ago. The tombs of Abydos have furnished material\r\nfor accounts of this early period. There were eight powerful kings in\r\nthe first dynasty and all of them contributed to the advancement of\r\ncivilization. Abydos, and later Memphis, were their principal cities.\r\nThey ruled in great luxury and were patrons of the arts and sciences.\r\nThe art works, sculptures, and carvings in ivory and ebony of this era\r\nspeak in eloquent terms of the taste and high mental powers of the\r\npeople. Modern museums are well supplied with relics of those times,\r\nwhich illustrate the degree of civilization attained by the Egyptians\r\nat the beginning of their history better than any written account.\r\n\r\nThe early Egyptians adopted the sciences, arts and customs of the\r\nBabylonians. With these as a basis the priests and learned men\r\nexperimented and made many independent researches and discoveries.\r\n\r\nThe pyramids, erected near Cairo 3000 B. C., indicate the high degree\r\nof culture which the early Egyptians had attained. These renowned\r\nmonuments to the kings were scientifically designed and constructed to\r\nexist for all time. In order to contribute to their usefulness, they\r\nwere planned so as to exhibit correct geometrical forms and indicate\r\nthe cardinal points of the compass and the positions of certain\r\nastronomical bodies. The details of their construction disclosed much\r\nmathematical, geometrical and physical knowledge, and their actual\r\nbuilding called for not only an all-around mechanical skill but a\r\nhigh degree of engineering ability. They were constructed of various\r\nmaterials. Some large granite blocks were used in the outside walls\r\nand these were brought from the upper Nile. They were towed down the\r\nriver on barges and were lifted into the positions in which they are\r\nfound to-day. Various mortars and mortar mixtures were employed in\r\nbinding the brickwork and masonry. These called for a good knowledge\r\nof chemistry and physics. The arches and sloping walls of some of the\r\nlarger pyramids show how well the architects and engineers of the day\r\nknew their professions. With similar means in their possession, the\r\nbest professional men of the present day would find it difficult to get\r\nsuch splendid results.\r\n\r\nIn the past few years, lapidaries and gem-workers have learned to cut\r\nstones and gems with steel disk-wheels, the cutting edges of which are\r\nfurnished with carborundum or emery powder or insets of diamonds. The\r\npyramid builders knew this method of sawing and cutting stones. They\r\nactually employed bronze saws set with diamonds to cut the huge blocks\r\nof granite, syenite, diorite, and basalt used in the construction of\r\nthe pyramids. They also set the cutting ends of their rock drills with\r\ndiamonds, and bored rocks as we do to-day with diamond core drills.\r\nThe art of making these tools was afterward lost. Only within the\r\npast half-century have mechanical rock saws and diamond drills been\r\nreinvented. This brilliantly indicates the inventive ability of the\r\nengineers at the dawn of Egypt's history. The builders of the splendid\r\nmonument of Rameses II in the Memnonium, at Thebes, which weighs 887\r\nlong tons, transported the huge stone by land from the quarries at\r\nE'Sooan, a distance of 138 miles. Such tasks appear never to have\r\ndeterred early Egyptian engineers and architects. They were so sure\r\nof their ability to carry their great operations to satisfactory\r\ncompletion that they never hesitated in agreeing to the severest\r\npenalties for nonfulfillment of contract. Their cranes, levers, wedges,\r\nrock drills, pumps, air blowers and compressors, and building tools all\r\nshowed how well mastered was their knowledge.\r\n\r\nTheir quarrying methods were similar to those used in the best practice\r\nto-day. When huge blocks and slabs of stone were needed the required\r\ndimensions were marked on the rock and channeled out. Metal wedges\r\nwere forced into the channels and struck at once by a large number of\r\nhammers. The constant vibration, in time, broke off the stone with\r\nclean-cut surfaces. When these were to be carved into statuary or\r\nornamental shapes it was often done at the quarries, so as to reduce\r\ntransportation difficulties. Water transportation was used when\r\npossible. When the stone had to be moved over the desert sands it was\r\nlifted by cranes and set on sleds drawn by men or animals, or driven\r\nforward by levers, just as heavy steel machinery is moved by modern\r\nengineers.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the siphon was known to the Egyptians at an early\r\nperiod. It was employed daily in many homes for supplying water and for\r\ndrawing off wine from barrels and tanks into domestic utensils. Its\r\nprincipal use, however, was in civil engineering works. Siphons were\r\nconstructed on a large scale for furnishing water to villages, draining\r\nland for farming, and for irrigation purposes. They were built, in many\r\nknown instances, for carrying large quantities of water, in high lifts,\r\nover hills.\r\n\r\nHerodotus tells us that the science of geometry was discovered by the\r\nEgyptians as a result of the necessity for making annual surveys of the\r\nfarming lands in the Nile valley.\r\n\r\nWhen geometry was established as a practical science, land and\r\nastronomical surveying were simplified and many branches of mathematics\r\nwere enlarged. The science of marine surveying was also developed and\r\nthis led to a great improvement in map-making and in geography, in\r\nwhich the Egyptians became famous.\r\n\r\nThe skill attained by the Egyptians in land surveying required accurate\r\nsurveying instruments. These were invented at an early period. The\r\nGreeks claim the invention of the theodolite and similar instruments,\r\nbut Egyptian history shows that gnomons, surveying compasses, and\r\nlevels were used by Egyptian surveyors long before the Greeks began to\r\nstudy the learning of Egypt.\r\n\r\nAstronomical science made great progress in Egypt. The theory\r\nattributing to the sun the central place in our planetary system,\r\nnow called the Copernican theory, was known and used in Egypt. They\r\nwere familiar with the obliquity of the ecliptic, and knew that the\r\nMilky Way was an aggregation of numerous stars of various sizes. They\r\nunderstood that moonlight is simply the reflected light of the sun. The\r\nmovements of comets, the positions of the principal stars and stellar\r\nconstellations and other astronomical phenomena were studied and\r\ncharted on astronomical maps or recorded and forecasted in astronomical\r\ntables.\r\n\r\nThe discoveries made by the Greek scientists naturally stimulated\r\nphilosophical thought, which in turn reacted upon scientific\r\nexperimentation and led to a broadening of the scope of general\r\nresearch work. We are dependent upon the pictorial records of early\r\nEgyptian times for descriptions of the instruments and machinery\r\nemployed and these are not always clear. They indicate, however, that\r\nthe Egyptians quickly learned the sciences developed by the Babylonians\r\nand other Oriental peoples and improved them. Their knowledge of\r\nastronomy, mathematics, geometry, chemistry, physics, medicine, and\r\nagriculture was extensive. The priests and learned men taught the\r\npure sciences and constantly experimented; the engineers, architects,\r\nsurveyors, and mechanics applied the sciences to the arts.\r\n\r\nIn one of the records of an early dynasty the father of a student\r\nsailing up the Nile to begin his studies in one of the leading\r\nscientific schools gave this advice: \"Put thy heart into learning and\r\nlove knowledge like a mother, for there is nothing that is so precious\r\nas learning.\"\r\n\r\nThe Mesopotamian peoples, as we saw in the last chapter, considered\r\nthe stars and principal heavenly bodies as deities. The Egyptians\r\ndid not do this, although they looked upon the heavens as the abode\r\nof all pious souls. Their astronomical knowledge at the time of the\r\nestablishment of the New Empire at Thebes, about the year 1320 B. C.,\r\nwas remarkably extensive.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians divided time in accordance with the course of the sun\r\ninto periods of 365¼ days, and these were divided in accordance with\r\nthe course of the moon into periods of about 29½ days. Thus the basis\r\nof the system of years and months used by us was perfectly understood\r\nby the Egyptians.\r\n\r\nThe science of medicine was developed at a very early period in\r\nEgyptian history. The various divisions of physicians, surgeons,\r\npharmaceutists, veterinarians, and dentists organized by the\r\nBabylonians were retained by the Egyptians. Many names of distinguished\r\npractitioners have been handed down. Nevertheless, their anatomical\r\nknowledge remained poor, and there were many superstitious practices\r\nconnected with medicine. The various medical manuals which have been\r\npreserved show that the Egyptian physicians studied diagnosis with\r\nmodern thoroughness. They were aware that an exact knowledge of each\r\ndisease, obtainable only by a complete study of the symptoms, was\r\nnecessary before a correct treatment could be prescribed. When the\r\nmagic and the superstitious dressings are abstracted from Egyptian\r\nmedical works and prescriptions, we find that the broad principles were\r\nsound and efficient. They were developed along lines similar to those\r\nof modern times.\r\n\r\nMathematics attracted much attention in Egypt. The learning of Oriental\r\ncountries on this subject was readily absorbed by the Egyptians. The\r\nGreek historians were so surprised at the efficiency of the Egyptians\r\nin this branch of knowledge that they almost unanimously asserted that\r\nthe mathematical sciences originated in Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe pyramid base lines run in the direction of the four points of the\r\ncompass, and were determined by correct astronomical methods. The\r\nastronomers and surveyors were skilled in trigonometry. Fractions were\r\nknown to the Egyptians, who were taught in the schools of Babylon. The\r\nmodern x, representing an unknown factor, was known to the Egyptians\r\nunder the name of \"hau.\"\r\n\r\nQuadratic equations were employed by them. The problem of finding x and\r\ny, when x² + y² = 100 and x:y = 1:¾, one of the earliest problems of\r\nthis character known, was found in a papyrus at Kahun. The problem was\r\nstated as follows: \"A given surface of, say, 100 units of area, shall\r\nbe represented as the sum of two squares, whose sides are to each other\r\nas 1:¾.\"\r\n\r\nThe papyrus gave the working out of the solution. Many similar\r\nproblems are given in mathematical works and papyri. They show the\r\nproficiency in mathematics that Egyptian scientists had attained at a\r\nremote period. But their methods of expressing mathematical problems\r\nwere crude and, consequently, involved much tedious labor in finding\r\nsolutions. There can be little doubt that if effective mathematical\r\nsymbols had been devised the abstract sciences would have made even\r\ngreater progress than they did in early Egypt. When we study the\r\ncomplicated solutions of algebraic problems made by the Egyptians,\r\nowing to the lack of simple symbols, we can appreciate how greatly\r\nmodern mathematical science is benefited by the devices now employed\r\nfor expressing quantities, variations, and operations.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians were expert in applying the discoveries of science to\r\nthe arts. The Nile made their country potentially rich in agriculture,\r\nand they devoted much attention to inventing such things as single and\r\ndouble plows, rakes, and other agricultural machines, many of which\r\nwere drawn by oxen, donkeys, and other animals. Reaping was done with\r\nsickles and scythes. Not only was irrigation understood and widely\r\npracticed, but the importance of fertilization was recognized.\r\n\r\nThe farmers understood the preservation of meat, vegetables, and\r\nfoodstuffs generally, by drying or pickling. They also brewed beer and\r\nmade wines, vegetable and seed oils, and alcohol. The selection of\r\nbreeding animals and the principles of variation were understood and\r\nemployed for developing particular breeds of cattle and farm stocks.\r\n\r\nThe papyrus reed grew luxuriantly in Egypt and this resulted in the\r\ndiscovery of paper making, weaving, thread making and many textile\r\nmethods. These industries led to the invention of looms, rope and twine\r\ntwisting appliances, flax weaving and other machinery. The linens and\r\ncloths made by these machines have never been excelled.\r\n\r\nDyeing was developed with the textile industries. As the skies of Egypt\r\nare bright, the people in all ages have had a fondness for brilliant\r\ncolors. The call for bright textile colors led to a considerable\r\ndevelopment in the chemistry of dyes and dyeing. Vegetable and mineral\r\ndyes were used. Dyes were not always applied to the whole pieces of\r\ngoods, but stenciling and other methods of patterning were used. The\r\nhighly organized artistic skill of the people demanded art-designed\r\ntextiles and the manufacturers responded with beautiful and rich\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nThe fur and feather industries became important at an early period. The\r\nEgyptians were fond of beautiful ornamental skins like those of the\r\npanther or gazelle. Such skins were manufactured into numerous domestic\r\narticles, made into clothing or used as rugs, mats, and seat coverings.\r\n\r\nSkins not valuable for art purposes were sent to the tanners to be\r\nconverted into various kinds of leather. Tanning was highly developed,\r\nand the tanners turned out leathers which are to-day admired for\r\ntheir excellence. The tanners carried on their industries by chemical\r\nprocesses similar to those in use to-day.\r\n\r\nThe scarcity of wood in Egypt led to the invention of various\r\nsubstitutes. One common substitute was a kind of _papier mâché_. This\r\nwas manufactured out of linen, wood or vegetable pulp and various\r\nkinds of paste. When it was used for art work the molded forms were\r\ncovered with lacquer or various kinds of stucco. Very beautiful objects\r\nwere manufactured from these substances, which indicate that the\r\nartists possessed a wide practical knowledge of physical and chemical\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nChemical knowledge was also well shown in their manufacture of glass.\r\nThey excelled in this industry. All kinds of glass were made and\r\ndecorated by staining and glazing. The glassmakers were able to\r\nimitate precious stones in glass and their glass-bead and enamel work\r\nhas never been excelled. Some modern chemists express the opinion that\r\nglass making was carried to a greater degree of perfection in Egypt\r\nthan any modern nation has attained.\r\n\r\nEgyptian porcelains were also finely executed. These were enameled,\r\nstained, and decorated in numerous ways. The colors, glazes, and art\r\nmediums employed by the artists in pottery and porcelain necessitated\r\na wide chemical knowledge. Some of the pigments employed both in\r\nglass and porcelain ornamentation were made from metals. Their use\r\nrequired a knowledge of metallurgy. Metals like lead, nickel, manganese\r\nrequired fluxing and refining before they could be secured in a state\r\nsufficiently pure to be used as bases for colors. Not only did the\r\nartists know the value of many metallic oxides, but they understood how\r\nto secure the tints resulting from blending different oxides, and by\r\nacting upon metals with acids, just as they acted upon vegetable and\r\nmetallic dyes with acids to get rare tones in linen dyeing.\r\n\r\nMordants were employed in dyeing cloths and these were acted upon by\r\nacids and alkalies to produce various colors. We are dependent upon the\r\nrelics which have been preserved for our knowledge of the chemical and\r\nphysical learning of the Egyptians. No chemical books of theirs have\r\ncome down to us, and inferences must be drawn from the results seen.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out metallurgical operations, the Egyptians employed small\r\nblast furnaces and melting pots. Air was compressed by bellows and\r\nconducted into molten substances by pipes.\r\n\r\nThe methods of metal working, melting, rolling, forging, soldering,\r\nannealing, and chasing were similar to common methods in use in modern\r\ntimes.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians were a practical people. They made wonderful progress\r\nin the industrial arts and learned enough of scientific principles\r\nto enable them to deal with much success with the mechanical,\r\nagricultural, astronomical, medicinal, and chemical problems\r\nencountered. But, like the Babylonians, Assyrians and other Oriental\r\npeoples, the Egyptians did not systematize their sciences. Their\r\ninvestigations were always carried out with practical objects in\r\nview, and when the objects were attained the experiments ceased. They\r\nnever discovered a true scientific method. That was left to be done\r\nby another people who were long students of Egyptian science and who,\r\ntaking all the learning of Egypt, worked out from it, as a basis, the\r\nprincipal sciences as we have them to-day. The Greeks took the torch of\r\nscientific progress from the Egyptians, organized learning, and passed\r\nit on to the Romans and other peoples in sound, effective and augmented\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks idealized and systematized scientific principles, whereas\r\nthe Egyptians and earlier peoples rested content with the results they\r\ncould obtain by their practical efforts. We will find that, throughout\r\nthe history of science, progress has always been made by similar\r\nreactions between peoples possessing the one a practical, the other a\r\nphilosophical genius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nFOUNDING OF SYSTEMATIC SCIENCE IN GREECE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe world is indebted to the Greeks as much for science as for art and\r\nliterature. The idealistic spirit of ancient Greece invested scientists\r\nas well as poets, artists, and thinkers generally. But the Greek\r\nscientists were students in the great schools of Egypt and brought\r\nmuch of their knowledge from that country. The greatest contributions\r\nmade by Greece were in the nature of methods and analysis. They were\r\nled to these by the tendencies of the Greek mind to abstract thought\r\nand philosophical investigations. They soon recognized that science\r\nis knowledge gained by certain methods of abstraction. Data had to\r\nbe systematically collected, digested, classified, and impartially\r\nstudied. The results of such studies had to be assembled and expressed\r\nin the most useful forms. Progress had to be made by the trial and\r\nerror method and the results of experiments tested by synthesis as well\r\nas analysis; by induction as well as deduction.\r\n\r\nThe Ionian philosophers were the first to break away from the\r\nmythological traditions surrounding the principles of Egyptian and\r\nAsiatic science. Thales of Miletus about the year 580 B. C. taught\r\nthat there is an essence, force, or soul in all things. This universal\r\nprinciple of activity is superhuman. Seeking to find of what the\r\nworld is made, he arrived at the idea that water, or moisture, is the\r\nbasic element. All matter, he said, is water in various forms and\r\ncombinations. Here we see scientific knowledge sought with a definite\r\naim and with unity of purpose. None of the earlier peoples had ever\r\nattempted to approach knowledge in this logical and fruitful manner.\r\n\r\nWhen the learned Babylonians were asked what the earth was they simply\r\nsaid: \"When the world was created, Marduk, the sun god, took Tiamat, or\r\nChaos, and divided her. The sky was formed above and the earth below.\"\r\nAnd the Egyptians answered the question in a similar way by saying:\r\n\"When the world was created, Shu tore the goddess Nuit from the arms of\r\nKeb, and now she hangs above him and he is the earth.\"\r\n\r\nIt was this kind of statement that Thales cast aside. He sought for\r\nmore concrete definitions. Customary beliefs were not acceptable to\r\nhim; his knowledge must be based on reason. Here we see the dawn\r\nof a new scientific spirit and the beginning of a new method of\r\ninvestigating knowledge. The world was introduced to a new field of\r\nintellectual activities.\r\n\r\nThe theory of Thales was studied by other Greek philosophers. But\r\nAnaximander, a friend of Thales, rejected it, and in its place\r\nsuggested that there is one eternal, indestructible substance which\r\nconstitutes the basis of matter. This was not water but an infinite\r\neternal motion. Water is subjected to extremes of temperature. Under\r\nsuch conditions nothing could have been stable enough to constitute\r\nmatter. A primary substance must be free from warring or antagonistic\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nThe world arose, said Anaximander, through the evolution of a substance\r\nsubjected to temperature changes which developed from the eternal,\r\nboundless, basic element. A sphere of flame arose from this, as from\r\nan explosion, and assumed a rounded form with concentric divisions. As\r\nthese rings became detached, the sun, moon, stars, and other heavenly\r\nbodies and the earth were formed. Aristotle tells us that, according\r\nto Anaximander's theory, the terrestrial region was at first moist;\r\nand, as the moisture was dried up by the sun, the portion that was\r\nevaporated produced the winds and the turnings of the sun and moon, the\r\nremaining portion becoming the sea. In time the sea, Anaximander held,\r\nwould dry up. The heat, or fire, of the world would burn the whole of\r\nthe cold moist element. Then the world would become a mixture of heat\r\nand cold like the boundless, primary element surrounding it, and by\r\nwhich it would be absorbed.\r\n\r\nThis theory of matter and the evolution of the world marks a notable\r\nadvance over any previous scientific theory. It was well developed by\r\nnumerous teachers of the Milesian philosophical school and has played a\r\ngreat rôle in intellectual history.\r\n\r\nThe daring nature of some of Anaximander's explanations of earthly\r\norganisms may be realized from a sketch of his views on the evolution\r\nof animals. He taught that living creatures arose from the moist\r\nelement as it was evaporated by the sun. Man at first resembled a fish.\r\nAll animals were developed in the moisture wrapped in a protecting\r\ncover or bark. As they advanced in age, they came out into a drier\r\natmosphere and discarded their protective coats. Man was not an\r\noriginal creation, but resulted from the fusion of other species.\r\nAnaximander's reason for this statement was that the period of infancy\r\nof the human being is so long that had he been born that way originally\r\nhe could not have survived. There must have been a slow development\r\nfrom ancient ancestors. This may be regarded as an anticipation of\r\nthe Darwinian theory. Thus man's thoughts in succeeding ages have a\r\nrhythmic swing.\r\n\r\nAnaximenes rejected some of Anaximander's ideas and furnished new\r\nones to take their places. He was not so daring a thinker as his\r\npredecessor, and his theory of the world was not as interesting as\r\nAnaximander's. Many of his teachings, however, are accepted as sound\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\nAnaximenes contended that the basic element was not boundless, but\r\ndeterminate. Innumerable substances are derivable from it and, just as\r\nour soul, like an atmosphere, holds us together, so do breath and air\r\nencompass the whole world. Air is always in motion, otherwise so many\r\nchanges could not be made by it. It differs in various substances in\r\nvirtue of its rarefaction and condensation.\r\n\r\nThe perpetual changes taking place in the world owing to the\r\ninstability of matter were emphasized by Heraclitus. He taught that\r\nthere is nothing immutable in the world process excepting the law or\r\nprinciple which governs it.\r\n\r\nCosmological speculations were not the only ones attracting the\r\nattention of the Greek scientists. Pythagoras, for example, founded a\r\nphilosophical college devoted to mathematical studies which resulted\r\nin the development of arithmetic to points beyond the requirements of\r\ncommerce. He made arithmetic the basis of a profound philosophical\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nPythagoras studied science in Egypt and first became familiar with\r\nEgyptian and Babylonian mathematics and geometry. He also studied\r\nthe Milesian cosmological philosophy. On his return to Greece from\r\nhis foreign studies he sought to discover a principle of homogeneity\r\nin the universe more acceptable than any suggested by the earlier\r\nphilosophers. He had noticed numerous relationships between numbers\r\nand natural phenomena, and believed that the true basis of philosophy\r\nwas to be found in numbers. In seeking data to sustain this thesis, he\r\ndiscovered harmonic progression. His experiments showed that when harp\r\nstrings of equal length were stretched by weights having the proportion\r\nof ½:⅔:¾, they produced harmonic intervals of an octave, a fifth and\r\na fourth apart. Since he saw that harmony of sounds depended upon\r\nproportion he concluded that order and beauty in the world originate\r\nin numbers. There are seven intervals in a musical scale, and seven\r\nplanets sweeping the heavens. Seven must, therefore, be a basic number.\r\nThis suggested to him his ideas regarding the harmony of the spheres.\r\n\r\nPythagoras and his students found that the sum of a series of odd\r\nnumbers from 1 to 2n+1 was always a complete square. When even numbers\r\nare added to the above series we get 2, 6, 12, 20, etc., in which every\r\nmember can be broken into two factors differing from each other by\r\nunity. Thus 6 = 2.3, 12 = 3.4, 20 = 4.5, etc. Such numbers were called\r\nheteromecic. Numbers like n(n+1)⁄₂ were called triangular. A large\r\nnumber of other arithmetical relations were found and given distinctive\r\nnames. The Pythagoreans were also familiar with the principles of\r\narithmetical, geometrical, harmonic, and musical proportion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DE WITT CLINTON TRAIN OF 1831 BESIDE A MODERN\r\nLOCOMOTIVE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOCOMOTIVE OF THE 1870 PERIOD STILL IN USE IN THE OZARKS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"JOHN BULL,\" A LOCOMOTIVE BROUGHT FROM ENGLAND AND PUT\r\nINTO SERVICE IN AMERICA IN 1831]\r\n\r\nPythagoras made similar advances in geometry. He believed that each\r\narithmetical fact had an analogue in geometry, and each geometrical\r\nfact a counterpart in arithmetic. He devised a rule by which integral\r\nnumbers could be found so that the sum of the squares of two of them\r\nequaled the square of the third. He also developed the theory of\r\nirrational quantities. The first incommensurable ratio discovered is\r\nsaid to have been that of the side of a square to its diagonal which is\r\n1:√2̅.\r\n\r\nEuclid (300 B. C.) developed this theory in the tenth book of his\r\ngeometry as still used.\r\n\r\nPythagoras not only placed mathematics on a solid scientific basis, he\r\nalso established the fact that the physical phenomena of the world are\r\ngoverned by mathematical laws.\r\n\r\nLittle progress appears to have been made in astronomy by the Greeks in\r\nthe time of Pythagoras. The Milesians and the associates of Pythagoras\r\nadvanced numerous theories, but none of these was better than some\r\nof the Egyptian ideas. Hicetas, and others of this period, believed\r\nthat the sun, moon, stars, and all other bodies in the heavens were\r\nstationary and that only the earth moved. The great turning movement\r\nof the earth around its axis produced the illusion that it was the\r\nheavenly bodies which were moving while the earth remained stationary.\r\n\r\nThe astronomical theories of Pythagoras, Hicetas, and Philolaus, all\r\naffirmed that the universe is composed of the elements earth, air,\r\nfire, and water, the whole mass being of spherical shape with the earth\r\nat the center and all having life or motion. These early theories,\r\n2,000 years later, did service by aiding to secure acceptance for the\r\nCopernican theory. The Pythagorean ideas that the universe is one\r\ngrand harmonious system, and that thought instead of sense is the sole\r\ncriterion of truth, have exercised important influence on intellectual\r\nspeculation throughout the ages.\r\n\r\nIn order to collect data for testing their theories in the physical and\r\nmathematical sciences, the Greeks invented many physical appliances.\r\nThe monochord, employed in determining the relationships of vibrating\r\nharmonic strings is one of the first mechanisms used in practical\r\nphysics that we have definite information about. An anvil, metal and\r\nglass disks, and bell-shaped cylinders were employed in studying the\r\nmovements of sound waves.\r\n\r\nAlcmæon (508 B. C.) was one of the earliest of the Greek anatomists. He\r\nwas a disciple of Pythagoras and employed the logical research methods\r\nof his teacher in the investigation of medical problems. Although\r\nthe Egyptians had developed medical science to a considerable extent\r\nand had taught the Greeks, their methods were not based upon sound\r\nprinciples. The result was that the more analytically minded Greeks\r\ncould not accept certain Egyptian ideas. The Egyptian anatomical\r\nteachings were particularly crude, and Alcmæon began to investigate\r\nthat science. His discoveries, both in anatomy and physiology, were\r\nvery great. He outlined the functions of the principal organs of the\r\nbody, discovered the optic nerve, the difference between the arterial\r\nand nervous systems, the Eustachian tube, the two divisions of the\r\nbrain, the nerves connecting the brain with the organs of sense and\r\nwith the spinal column. These advances placed the medical sciences\r\non a logical basis similar to that of the physical, mathematical, and\r\nastronomical sciences. This first great anatomist and physiologist\r\ninvented the practice of anatomical dissection and surgical\r\nexploration, and advanced the practice of medicine to a higher degree\r\nof usefulness.\r\n\r\nAfter the Greeks had satisfied themselves that they possessed a\r\ncosmological theory which answered the demands of reason they turned\r\ntheir investigations to the question of how matter was changed into\r\nits innumerable forms. Empedocles had taught that when the primary\r\nelements, earth, air, fire, and water, were mixed in variable\r\nproportions they yielded different kinds of matter. Leucippus,\r\nDemocritus, Anaxagoras, and others studied the subject more carefully\r\nand developed a novel theory. When matter is divided as far as possible\r\ndo the ratios of the constituents remain the same? This problem\r\nattracted their attention. They also asked themselves whether there was\r\nnot a simpler conception to explain the basic state of matter. When\r\nthey began their inquiries, the qualities of matter were believed to\r\nreflect their essences. For example, the sweetness of honey and the\r\ncolor of the sky were real things which should be studied in themselves\r\napart from honey and the sky. Democritus thought, however, that such\r\nchanges of color as the sky undergoes at dawn and sunset would not\r\ntake place if the colors were real elementary things. While meditating\r\non this the thought arose in their mind: \"If we assume matter to be\r\ncomposed of an infinite number of minutest particles or atoms, could we\r\nnot explain the changes in matter by changes in atomic quantities and\r\norders?\" This line of thought resulted in the development of the atomic\r\ntheory and the origin of the philosophic school of the atomists.\r\n\r\nAccording to Leucippus some of the atoms darting about in the universe\r\ncollide and thus give rise to new substances. He also believed that\r\nthe atoms followed whirling or circular paths and that such rotary\r\nmotions drew in neighboring atoms, and that as these movements\r\ncontinued indefinitely within the atoms the constituents were being\r\nconstantly rearranged, the lighter elements being grouped around the\r\nperiphery; the heavier ones around the center. These changes were due\r\nto pressure and impact. These conceptions about atoms were carried\r\ninto cosmological discussions and it was taught that there are various\r\nworlds and planets within the boundless universe, each one moving\r\nfreely according to physical laws, unless fractured by collision with\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nZeno challenged these doctrines because of the importance attached to\r\nthe whirling motion. He attempted to show that such atomic motions\r\nare impossible. His proofs of the impossibility of atomic motion were\r\ndesigned with the object of sustaining his own theory of an ultimate\r\nprinciple of unity. His mental trend was toward negation. Whenever his\r\nrival Parmenides argued affirmatively regarding a scientific principle,\r\nZeno would invariably maintain the negative side of the question.\r\n\r\nZeno's first proof of the impossibility of motion referred to the\r\nimpossibility of passing through a fixed space. He showed that by\r\ndividing a line into an infinite number of parts an infinite number of\r\npoints would be obtained and these permitted no beginning of motion.\r\n\r\nHis second proof tried to show the impossibility of passing through\r\nspace having movable boundaries. The story of Achilles and the\r\ntortoise illustrates this. A pursuer in a race at every interval must\r\nreach a point from which the pursued starts simultaneously. But the\r\nlatter is always in advance.\r\n\r\nThe third, or \"resting arrow,\" argument showed that a moving arrow\r\nis at every instant in some one point of its track. Its movement at\r\nsuch instant is then equal to zero. Its track is a group of zeros. No\r\nmagnitude could be framed from these.\r\n\r\nZeno also anticipated much later philosophical discussions, like\r\nEinstein's, relating to the relativity of motion. He took for an\r\nexample a moving wagon. Its movement would appear different to\r\nobservers on other moving bodies going in various directions. They\r\nwould see changes in rates of speed as well as in direction.\r\n\r\nProtagoras, at a subsequent date, developed this idea of relativity and\r\nshowed that things are as they appear to each individual at the moment\r\nthey are perceived. He summarized his teaching in the aphorism: Man is\r\nthe measure of all things.\r\n\r\nThe Skeptics, 200 years later, developed the Protagorean theory of\r\nrelativity, and by a series of arguments attempted to prove that\r\nperceptions change not only with the different species of animate\r\nbeings, but with many conditions and circumstances. It was also shown\r\nthat not only man's perceptions are subject to changes, but also his\r\nopinions following from his perceptions. Another school taught that to\r\nevery opinion the opposite can be opposed with equally good reasons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nGOLDEN AGE OF GREEK SCIENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nScience had made a great advance as a result of the researches and\r\ntheories of the atomists. A consistent mechanical theory of matter and\r\nthe universe had been set forth. Science and philosophy were stripped\r\nof many of the old superstitions that had clung to them. The leading\r\ntheories invented were based on logical principles. While these changes\r\nwere being worked out, numerous inventions of scientific instruments\r\nand apparatus were made and systematic methods of studying science were\r\norganized. These furnished the means for still greater progress.\r\n\r\nThe apparent completeness of the mechanical theory of the universe\r\nsatisfied the inquiring intellect. The excitement caused by the\r\nscientific discussions and discoveries from the time of Heraclitus\r\nsubsided. But after a short intervening period, when public attention\r\nhad been largely centered on practical affairs, there was a reaction\r\nagainst science. When scientific principles were quoted a tendency\r\nwas shown to question their validity and usefulness. This resulted in\r\ninquiries into the sources of knowledge and conduct and ushered in a\r\nnew intellectual era that is now known as the Humanistic period which,\r\nbeginning about 450 B. C., extended to 400 B. C.\r\n\r\nThe Sophists, who were teachers of rhetoric and were accustomed to\r\nstudying the phrasing of verbal statements, became active in searching\r\nfor the foundations of thought.\r\n\r\nThe Protagorean theory of knowledge was based on Empedocles's doctrine\r\nthat the inner atoms advance to meet the outer ones. Perception is\r\nthe resultant product of these atoms when they collide. They believed\r\nthat this perception is something else than the perceiving subject\r\nand is also something different from the object giving birth to the\r\nperception. It is conditioned by both, but has a distinct existence.\r\nThe doctrine of the subjectivity of sense perception was developed\r\nin explanation of this psychological problem. From this it followed\r\nthat knowledge must be strictly personal and could be true only under\r\nconditions existing at the instant of perception. These limitations\r\ncaused Protagoras to advance his theory of relativity, which teaches\r\nthat man is the measure of all things. Facts are what appear to each\r\nindividual to be statements of truth. Isocrates, Plato, Aristotle, and\r\nSocrates were the leaders of this intellectual movement.\r\n\r\nSocrates developed the Pythagorean theory of intelligible forms. The\r\nspecific qualities of the senses belong to the realm of perception.\r\nWhen these are withdrawn from an object of thought there remains only\r\nthe form or idea. Therefore it is evident that pure, intelligible\r\nforms constitute the essences of things. The early scientists, such\r\nas Democritus, thought, perhaps, in terms of atom forms. Socrates,\r\nPlato, and later teachers looked upon forms as conceptions of similar\r\nlogical elements. Knowledge, in the view of Democritus, was essentially\r\nrationalistic. Plato considered knowledge as having ethical and\r\næsthetic purposes within itself.\r\n\r\nEach of these types of rationalism stimulated Greek thought and\r\nresulted in a strong impulse to philosophical and scientific\r\ninvestigation. They prepared the outlook for Aristotle.\r\n\r\nScience had been hampered by the confusion raised by the discussions\r\nrelating to forms. Aristotle realized that proper progress in logic,\r\nphysics, and ethics, the leading sciences of his time, could not be\r\nmade unless the essential nature of science were kept in view. He saw\r\nthat knowledge of the forms of correct thinking can be understood\r\nonly by keeping in view the object of thought and this requires\r\ndefinite ideas of the general relations of knowledge and its objects.\r\nThe study of general relationships led to the study of particular or\r\nspecial relations. The connection of general with particular ideas\r\nwas unfolded, and Aristotle saw that conceiving, understanding, and\r\nproving result from the deduction of particular from universal, or\r\ngeneral, ideas. Therefore science consists in deriving or deducing\r\nfacts acquired through perception from their general grounds or\r\nphenomena. The logical form of the syllogism naturally suggested itself\r\nto Aristotle when engaged with these thoughts and the invention of the\r\nsyllogism was one of the most brilliant contributions to knowledge made\r\nby the Greeks.\r\n\r\nThe logical results of the invention of syllogistic forms suggested\r\na solution of the problem of true reality which Aristotle showed was\r\nthe essence that unfolds in phenomena themselves. This led to fruitful\r\nscientific results. Plato and his contemporaries unified mathematics,\r\nformulated the definitions logically, and demonstrated correct methods\r\nof criticism and proof. A point was shown to be the boundary of a\r\nline; while a line is the boundary of a surface, and a surface the\r\nboundary of a solid. This concrete definition of scientific elements\r\nprogressed through the use of analytic methods, by proceeding from the\r\nknown to the unknown, and led to the discovery of tests for scientific\r\nassumptions and of synthetic proof. None of the earlier philosophers\r\npossessed anything like the progressive tools Aristotle placed in the\r\nhands of scientists. Their use quickly led to a general review of\r\nknowledge and a great increase in the number of sciences.\r\n\r\nThe textbook on geometry compiled by Euclid, still used in many\r\nschools, gives us a good picture of the state of scientific methods\r\nin his time. Euclid, like Aristotle, Plato, Socrates and others, was\r\na great systematizer. He collected the geometrical proofs of his\r\nmathematical predecessors, selected those which were logically correct\r\nand simple, and raised on a few axioms, or first principles, a great\r\ngeometrical system.\r\n\r\nArchimedes published textbooks on spherical and cylindrical geometry.\r\nHe proved that the surface of a sphere is equal to four times a great\r\ncircle. He showed the properties of spherical segments and methods for\r\ncalculating surface areas and other parts of spherical forms.\r\n\r\nThis great scientist also developed mechanics and physics. He\r\ninvestigated the lever and demonstrated the principle upon which its\r\npower is based. He then studied hydrostatics and hydraulics, and\r\ndiscovered the theory of specific gravity and invented methods for\r\ndetermining it.\r\n\r\nApollonius began publishing scientific textbooks about forty years\r\nafter Archimedes. His masterpiece was his textbook on conic sections.\r\n\r\nThe work done by Archimedes on the quadrature of curvilinear figures\r\nresulted, centuries later, in the discovery of the infinitesimal\r\ncalculus, while the theory of conic sections published by Apollonius\r\nled to theories for the solution of problems relating to geometrical\r\ncurves of all degrees. They placed the geometry of measurements and the\r\ngeometry of forms and positions on strictly scientific bases.\r\n\r\nHipparchus applied the new mathematical and geometrical discoveries to\r\nastronomy. He found a method for representing the observed motions of\r\nthe sun, moon, and planets by assumed uniform circular motions. His\r\ntheory of the sun's motion assumed that the earth was not the center\r\nof the sun's orbit. He drew a line through the earth and the real\r\ncenter of the orbit and found where the sun's distance is least and\r\nwhere greatest. He then compiled a large set of solar tables giving\r\nthe position of the sun among the stars at any time. He next turned\r\nhis attention to the movements of the moon and prepared tables for\r\ndetermining eclipses.\r\n\r\nThen the various planets were studied and their mean motions were\r\ncalculated and recorded. The stars were mapped and catalogued. He\r\ndescribed the apparent movements of 1,080 stars and comparing his\r\nobservations and calculations with those of Aristyllus and Timocharis,\r\nmade 150 years previously. He also discovered the precession of the\r\nequinoxes.\r\n\r\nThe astronomical calculations of Hipparchus led to a great improvement\r\nin trigonometrical methods. By using chords, as we use sines, and\r\nassuming the heavens to be a plane surface, he fixed the positions of\r\nstars (and similarly geographical points) by the intersections of lines\r\nof latitude and longitude.\r\n\r\nA planosphere, an instrument for representing the mechanism of the\r\nheavens, was among the many scientific inventions of Hipparchus.\r\n\r\nWhile Hipparchus was engaged upon problems in astronomical physics,\r\nHero, a professor of science at Alexandria, was working out numerous\r\nproblems relating to matter and devising machines for practically\r\napplying the teachings of mechanical science. Ctesibius, assisted\r\nperhaps by his pupil Hero, made a large number of valuable engineering\r\ninventions. He was an authority on hydraulics and pneumatics. He\r\ndevised improved siphons, a pneumatic organ, a force pump, a vacuum\r\npump, a hot-air motor, and other machines.\r\n\r\nHis studies regarding the physics of gases led him to adopt a molecular\r\ntheory of matter. He believed that there are vacua existing between the\r\ninnumerable particles which constitute matter in all its states and\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nCtesibius improved surveying instruments. His dioptra, an instrument\r\ncorresponding to a theodolite, was a plane table set on a tripod,\r\nfurnished with compass points and two sights. The plane was adjusted\r\nby screws and a water level. This instrument was used by engineers for\r\nleveling, laying out irrigation works and farm lands, sinking shafts\r\nfor mining and prospecting purposes, and for tunneling. A cyclometer\r\nfor measuring angles of dip and elevation of rock beds and mountains\r\nwas also used with this instrument.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks owed much of their knowledge of hydrostatics, mechanics,\r\npneumatics, and physics generally to Ctesibius. He was not only a\r\ngreat inventor and lecturer, but also a writer of valuable textbooks\r\ndealing with physical and mechanical sciences.\r\n\r\nHero edited a number of editions of the textbooks of Ctesibius, and is\r\ncredited with inventing some of the theories and machines discussed.\r\nHe, too, published numerous scientific books.\r\n\r\nHero's work in trigonometry was important. He described a formula\r\nfor estimating the area of a triangle which still bears his name. He\r\ndefined spherical triangles and arranged methods for determining the\r\nvolumes of irregular solids by measuring the water displaced by them.\r\n\r\nThe steam turbine is the best known of Hero's machines. Scholars read\r\nmuch about his wonderful musical instruments operated automatically\r\nby pneumatic means resembling the mechanisms of player-pianos, and\r\nparticularly about his mechanical toy mimicking a number of singing\r\nbirds. A group of birds were made alternately to sing and to whistle.\r\nThe mechanism consisted of air tubes operating various kinds of\r\nwhistles. A running stream was made to operate an air compressor.\r\nThe air from the compressor tank operated the various movements of\r\nthe birds and supplied air for blowing the whistles. The numerous\r\nmechanisms of this character which Hero and his master made indicate\r\nthat they were as much at home in making pneumatic and similar\r\nmechanical toys as is any expert to-day. They not only knew the\r\nscientific principles, but had the engineering and mechanical ability\r\nto design them and make them work.\r\n\r\nHero's fire engine is not as well known as his steam engine. It was a\r\nremarkable invention, however. It was worked by levers and force pumps\r\nand resembled the engines still employed by fire companies in some\r\nremote rural districts.\r\n\r\nNot the least interesting machine described by Hero was his slot\r\nmachine for dispensing wine and other liquids. This machine consisted\r\nof a cylindrical container with a slot hole on top through which coins\r\nwere dropped. Beneath this there was a lever with a receptacle for the\r\ndropped coin. The weight of a falling coin depressed one arm of the\r\nlever and raised the other, which opened a valve and allowed the liquid\r\nto escape. When the lever arm had moved a certain distance, the coin\r\nslipped off and the valve was automatically closed.\r\n\r\nHero's steam turbine was a crude model. Steam was generated in a boiler\r\nand conducted through pipes so as to play upon revolving globes or\r\nwheel vanes. This machine was invented to operate mechanical toys. It\r\nwas not until nearly 2,000 years later that it occurred to an inventor\r\nthat steam could be used to operate more important mechanism than toys.\r\n\r\nThe next great name in science is that of Claudius Ptolemy, an Egyptian\r\nastronomer, who lived in Alexandria about 139 A. D. He brought out\r\nnew editions of the mathematical works of Hipparchus, and published a\r\nnumber of scientific books of his own. His principal work, known as the\r\nGrammar of Mathematics, formed the basis of all astronomical studies\r\ndown to the time of Copernicus, about 1500 A. D.\r\n\r\nThe earth formed the center of the universe, according to Ptolemy's\r\ntheory. The sun and planets, he thought, revolved around the earth.\r\n\r\nWe obtain our minutes and seconds from Ptolemy's great work. He divided\r\nthe circle with 360 degrees and its diameter into 120 divisions. Each\r\ndivision of the circumference he divided into sixty parts. The Latin\r\nnames for these parts were _partes minutæ primæ_ and _secundæ_, or the\r\nfirst small divisions and the second small divisions.\r\n\r\nThe Greek scientists were so interested in logical analysis that\r\nthey constantly investigated the fundamental facts upon which their\r\nteachings were based. They made provisional hypotheses, deduced\r\nmathematical consequences, and compared these with the results of\r\nobservation and experiments. When Hipparchus found that his planetary\r\ntheories did not meet his tests, he decided to make as many new\r\nobservations as possible and collect astronomical data to be used at\r\na later period by other scientists. He realized that, while he knew\r\nthe old theories were incorrect, there was not enough data at hand to\r\nenable better theories to be established. He therefore deliberately\r\nlabored to provide data for posterity.\r\n\r\nPtolemy's treatise on geography was an encyclopedia of places, names,\r\nand descriptions. In this work he located over 5,000 places between\r\nIndia and Morocco, giving their latitude and longitude.\r\n\r\nPtolemy's textbooks on sound and optics were long celebrated. The\r\nwork on optics contained valuable chapters on refraction, a subject\r\nhe had done much to develop. These works contained some of the finest\r\ncollections of experimental data illustrating the best scientific\r\nmethods used in antiquity.\r\n\r\nThe next great mathematicians and physicists are Pappus and Diophantus.\r\nThe former lived about 300 A. D. He was the author of textbooks on\r\nmathematics and astronomy. Some of these have been preserved and are of\r\ngreat value in exhibiting the status of Greek science at that time.\r\n\r\nThe arithmetical textbook of Diophantus, which is extant, is remarkable\r\nas being the first to contain a complete exposition of algebra and the\r\nuse of algebraic symbols and methods. Euclid solved quadratic equations\r\ngeometrically and Hero solved them algebraically, although without\r\nusing symbols. But in Diophantus's arithmetic quadratics are solved\r\nby the use of algebraic symbols. After several centuries, when the\r\nEuclidean geometry was in the ascendant, and many problems which were\r\nsuited to arithmetical and algebraic methods of analysis were solved by\r\ngeometrical and trigonometrical means, Diophantus succeeded in renewing\r\ninterest in arithmetic and mathematics generally.\r\n\r\nPolitical changes and other intellectual interests soon after the time\r\nof Diophantus turned men's thoughts in other directions and no great\r\nscientists were afterward developed by the Greeks.\r\n\r\nWhile the physicists were making their discoveries, medical men were\r\nstudying anatomy, biology, and materia medica. Medical science in the\r\ntime of Diophantus had a status, with a theory and practice, closely\r\nresembling those of to-day.\r\n\r\nHippocrates of Cos (460 B. C.), was the greatest leader of Greek\r\nmedical science. He cast superstition aside and based his researches\r\nand practice upon the same principles of inductive philosophy that had\r\nproved so valuable in other sciences. He established hospitals for\r\nthe nursing of the sick, and had attendants note the symptoms and the\r\nhistories of the cases. In this way a number of casebooks were made.\r\nHe wrote a work on Public Health. His operations in trepanning were\r\nmore heroic than would be undertaken by good surgeons to-day. These are\r\ndescribed in his book on Injuries of the Head. Many of his works are\r\nextant and furnish very interesting and valuable pictures of the state\r\nof medical science in Greece.\r\n\r\nDuring the several centuries in which the Greeks placed science and all\r\nthe leading departments of knowledge upon firm bases, stripped of the\r\nsentimental and traditional trappings which had come down from remote\r\ntimes, changes of a political nature were causing the immigration of\r\nforeign peoples to Greece. The importance of preserving racial purity\r\nwas not recognized. The result was that the original Greeks, who were\r\nof the long-headed type, were forced to give way to the hordes of\r\ninferior peoples coming in from Asia. These new, round-headed people\r\nwere not original thinkers, and were unable to advance science and the\r\narts as the Greeks had done. They were, to a large extent, even unable\r\nto appreciate the wonderful treasures of knowledge bestowed upon them\r\nby the cultured people they had displaced.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians and Babylonians advanced knowledge for practical purposes\r\nand when these were served they showed no desire to explore further.\r\nBut the analytical mind of the Greek called for knowledge of basic laws\r\nand first principles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE ROMAN AND MIDDLE AGES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Romans succeeded to Greek culture; but they were a business people.\r\nThey exhibited smaller intellectual capacity than the Greeks for\r\nanalytical thinking. This precluded them from advancing the sciences.\r\nThe Romans attained great eminence in oratory, history, art, and\r\nliterature. They probably equaled the Greeks in music. They never\r\nproduced any great thinkers like Aristarchus, Hipparchus, Euclid,\r\nPtolemy, Archimedes, Democritus, Hippocrates, Plato, Aristotle, and\r\nothers referred to in the preceding chapters.\r\n\r\nWhat the Romans lacked in intellect they made up in energy. They\r\nbecame good soldiers and sailors, good politicians, able architects,\r\nengineers, and farmers. This explains how they became so powerful\r\npolitically. They were the most practical people in a practical world.\r\nInstead of bequeathing us great scientific masterpieces like the\r\nGreeks, they have left us miles of useful roads, waterways, walls,\r\nfortresses, bridges, buildings, and statuary. Remains of these objects\r\noccur throughout Europe and northern Africa, showing that Roman\r\nengineering practice has been as universally useful as Roman law and\r\npolitical practices. The great scientific discoveries of the world have\r\nbeen made by only a few peoples. Those nations which have possessed\r\nthe scientific temperament have not always been productive. Great\r\ninventions and discoveries appear to be made in response to national\r\nneeds and are preceded by long periods during which the preparatory\r\nwork is being done. The great men of science being active generalizes,\r\nneed the cooperation of many lesser scientists to collect data and\r\nobservations upon which general theories may be built. This appears\r\nto be the explanation of the irregular periods of great scientific\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nJulius Cæsar, great in many departments of human endeavor, carried\r\nthrough two important scientific reforms. He caused the rectification\r\nof the calendar. In the year 47 B. C. there was an accumulated error\r\nof nearly 85 days in the calendar. This was corrected and the year was\r\nmade to consist of 365 days, with an additional day every four years.\r\nCæsar's calendar is still in use.\r\n\r\nHis other reform, which was not completed until the reign of Augustus,\r\nwas a scientific survey of the Roman empire. This conferred great\r\nbenefits not only upon Rome, but upon the world. Geography, commerce,\r\nand industry were enlarged, many practical scientists were trained, and\r\nthe various data and maps which had to be collected and drawn resulted\r\nin many improvements in statistical methods and in surveying and\r\nastronomical computations.\r\n\r\nAn early contribution to science by Rome was the textbook on\r\nArchitecture by Vitruvius. This great work became the standard guide to\r\nbuilding until the changed conditions in the Middle Ages called for new\r\narchitectural methods.\r\n\r\nThe works on natural philosophy by Lucretius, the geography of Strabo,\r\nthe books on natural history by Pliny, and the encyclopedic medical\r\nworks of Galen were successive contributions. These chiefly aimed\r\nat developing the teachings of the great Greek scientists for the\r\npractical use of the Romans.\r\n\r\nRoman history shows that all branches of the learned professions were\r\npopular and Roman professional men were very competent. None, however,\r\nstands out as a great discoverer. The names just above recorded are\r\nthose of the chief lights of Roman science, and they simply reflect the\r\npractical nature of the Roman intellect. The best the Romans did was to\r\npreserve Greek science, test it extensively by practical applications\r\nthroughout their vast empire, and hand it on to succeeding nations.\r\n\r\nPhilosophical thought in the declining years of Greece turned to\r\ntheosophical speculations, and finally to ethics and theology. Much\r\ninterest was evinced by the Romans in ethics, æsthetics, and theology.\r\nA new religion, destined to exert profound influences on intellectual\r\ndevelopments, gradually attracted the attention of thinkers. The Romans\r\nwere fascinated by the monotheism of Christianity and the doctrines of\r\na future life and good will and love. There grew out of the critical\r\nattacks on this new theology a powerful scholastic philosophy aiming\r\nat the exposition, systematization, and demonstration of the principal\r\nChristian doctrines.\r\n\r\nAurelius Augustinus, a native of Africa (353-430 A. D.), championed\r\nthe opinion that knowledge of God and self was the proper kind to\r\nstudy. The sciences have only value in illuminating the power of\r\nGod. Intelligence is necessary to comprehend what we believe; faith\r\nis required to believe what we comprehend. As the highest good, or\r\nmoral ideal, is transcendent, Christians cannot realize it, so human\r\nperfection should consist in the love of God and bearing good will to\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe conditions brought about by this turn of thought were not favorable\r\nfor scientific development. The world had to wait until the scholastic\r\nphilosophy lost itself in metaphysical discussions. Then Roger Bacon\r\n(1214-1294) released science and mathematics from the chains which had\r\nso long confined them.\r\n\r\nWhile European thought was occupied in discussing scholastic\r\nphilosophy, the Arabs and Moors were carrying on the practice of the\r\nsciences. The Moors in Spain published many valuable textbooks and\r\ndeveloped new principles in architecture and medicine. Their Giralda\r\nobservatory in Seville was the first astronomical building erected in\r\nEurope, and their university in Cordova remained for a long period the\r\nleading professional school.\r\n\r\nThe universities of Paris, Salerno, Oxford, and Cambridge, and the law\r\nschool at Bologna, were founded in the eleventh and twelfth centuries\r\nand have continued to hold up the torch of science until our time.\r\n\r\nRoger Bacon, an English Franciscan monk, was a graduate of the\r\nUniversity of Paris. He was a brilliant student of physical and\r\nmathematical sciences. Pope Clement IV invited him to write a textbook\r\nof science. Bacon did this in 1266. He became a professor in Oxford\r\nUniversity in 1268. His _Opus Majus_ (1267) summarized ancient and\r\ncurrent philosophy and science and included the researches of the\r\nMoors. This great book reasserted the fact that science must be based\r\nupon experiments and that the astronomical and physical sciences must\r\nrest upon geometry and mathematics. Bacon's clear recognition of the\r\nvalue of experimental methods and logical exposition mark him as the\r\ngreatest intellectual force of his century.\r\n\r\nThe errors in the calendar were estimated and corrected by Bacon.\r\nHe criticized the astronomical principles of Ptolemy, which were\r\nstill generally accepted. His experiments in physics led him to make\r\nimportant discoveries in optics. He improved lenses and apparently made\r\nmicroscopes and telescopes. He proposed a lunar theory in accounting\r\nfor the movements of the tides.\r\n\r\nRoger Bacon made so many accurate comments on physical phenomena and so\r\naccurately forecasted recent mechanical inventions that his book, which\r\nwas so far in advance of his time that it was unintelligible and caused\r\nhim to be charged with witchcraft, still astonishes its readers.\r\n\r\nLenses were used for spectacles in Asia in the remotest times, but\r\nthere are reasons for believing that Bacon was the first to prescribe\r\nthem on scientific principles for the correction of defective vision.\r\nHe also appears to have appreciated the value of gunpowder as an\r\nexplosive agent and had it introduced into Europe from Morocco. Being\r\nmisunderstood, Bacon founded no school and left no students.\r\n\r\nNicole Oresme, Bishop of Normandy (1323-1382), used fractional powers\r\nin mathematics and developed a notation. About the same period, Thomas\r\nBradwardine, Archbishop of Canterbury, wrote on star polygons, and\r\nother Englishmen, like Boethius and Bath, wrote new textbooks on\r\nastronomy and mathematics. They started a school of trigonometry in\r\nEngland that made great improvements in that branch of science.\r\n\r\nBetween 1200 and 1400 A. D. the magnetic compass was improved and used\r\nat sea, clocks were improved and made popular, improvements were made\r\nin weaving, printing was invented, textbooks were written on many\r\nsubjects, and education began to spread in Europe. All these factors\r\nprepared the way for a great industrial and scientific awakening.\r\n\r\nNicholas de Cusa (1401-1464), Bishop of Brixen, published books on\r\nmathematics and suggested that the earth's movements indicate a diurnal\r\nrotation.\r\n\r\nThe way was now paved for a new theory of planetary motions. Nicolaus\r\nCopernicus (1473-1543) a Pole, developed the astronomical system\r\nbearing his name, as a result of suggestions gained by studying the\r\nworks of the Greek astronomer Hicetas, and Plutarch's Lives of Greek\r\nScientists. His great work was entitled \"De Revolutionibus Orbium\r\nCelestium, or the Movements of Heavenly Bodies,\" which treated the sun\r\nas the center of the planetary system.\r\n\r\nWeather forecasting was improved by Tycho Brahe (1546-1601), and many\r\nfine astronomical observations were made by him. He greatly improved\r\nastronomical instruments and built and splendidly equipped a great\r\nobservatory in Uraniborg, Denmark. Numerous important observations were\r\nmade there.\r\n\r\nJohn Kepler, the discoverer of the ellipticity of the planetary orbits\r\nand the laws of their movements, was a student under Brahe, and\r\ncontinued his master's researches. His observations on the movements\r\nof the planet Mars led to his discovery that the planets travel in\r\nellipses and not in circles. Besides his numerous works on astronomy\r\nhe wrote valuable books on optics and other scientific subjects.\r\n\r\nGalileo (1564-1642) took up the work of Tycho Brahe and Kepler and\r\ncarried it forward to new triumphs. He made the first telescope ever\r\nused for astronomical observation, and with it was able to discern\r\nthat the Milky Way was composed of aggregations of innumerable stars;\r\nthat the surface of the moon was covered with plains and mountains,\r\nthat there were four moons revolving around the planet Jupiter, that\r\nthe planet Venus showed phases like those of the moon as she moved\r\naround her orbit, and that there were black spots, at times, upon the\r\nsun, which revealed its rotation on its axis. Galileo did equally\r\nfundamental work in developing the laws of motion, and the principles\r\nof mechanism and physics.\r\n\r\nThe development of modern mathematics began with three intellectual\r\nfeats--the invention of the Arabic notation, of decimal fractions,\r\nand of logarithms. The notation was derived by the Arabs from India\r\nabout 700 A. D. They had used numerals long before, but the old system\r\nwas crude like the systems employed by the Egyptians and Greeks. The\r\nTextbook on Mathematics by Mohammed ibn Musa, published at Bagdad about\r\n825 A. D., contained the first notable exposition of modern numerals.\r\nThis important work gave rise to many more Arabic treatises, some of\r\nwhich showed improved methods.\r\n\r\nDecimal fractions were used by the early peoples of central Asia and\r\nwere transmitted by them to the Babylonians. Their system was based,\r\napparently, upon a sexagesimal scale. Simon Stevin (1548-1620), a\r\nBelgian, made great improvements in decimals. He adopted the plan of\r\nWilliam Buckley, of England, and other mathematicians, and made the\r\nbase 100,000, instead of 60.\r\n\r\nJohn Napier (1550-1617), a Scottish nobleman, invented logarithms. The\r\nstory of this great mathematician's work is one of the most interesting\r\nin the history of science. Napier's first table of logarithms was\r\npublished in 1614. Henry Briggs (1556-1631), professor at Oxford, made\r\nsuggestions for the improvement of the tables, and persuaded Napier\r\nto make the base 10, as is now done in tables of common logarithms.\r\nBriggs published tables in 1624 containing the logarithms to 14 places\r\nof decimals for the numbers between 1 and 20,000 and from 90,000 to\r\n100,000. Adrian Vlacq (1600-1667), a Dutchman, computed the logarithms\r\nof the numbers running from 20,000 to 90,000, and thus completed\r\nthe whole series of logarithms between 1 and 100,000. Edmund Gunter\r\n(1581-1626), of London, calculated the logarithmic sines and tangents\r\nof angles for every minute to seven places. He invented the terms\r\ncosine and cotangent and used them in a work published in 1620.\r\n\r\nAnother Englishman, William Oughtred (1574-1660), wrote textbooks on\r\nmathematics, and invented numerous mathematical symbols which are now\r\nin general use, as well as rectilinear and circular slide rules.\r\n\r\nBonaventura Cavalieri (1598-1647) made many improvements in\r\nmathematical formulæ and expounded a new method of indivisibles which\r\nsolved some of the difficult astronomical problems raised by Kepler,\r\nand enabled Torricelli, Viviani, de Roberval, and others to solve\r\nabstruse problems relating to all types of curved figures.\r\n\r\nPierre de Fermat (1601-1665), one of the greatest of French\r\nmathematicians, developed rules for calculating maxima and minima. His\r\nfunctions in this type of equation closely approached those of the\r\ndifferential calculus. The calculus was developed from Fermat's work by\r\nLagrange, Laplace, Fourier, and other Frenchmen.\r\n\r\nPascal and Fermat developed the theory of probability. Pascal worked\r\nout many useful methods for dealing with curves.\r\n\r\nThe intense mathematical activity in England and France resulting from\r\nthe stimulation given by the invention of Napier, prepared the way for\r\nthe discovery of the infinitesimal calculus by Newton and Leibnitz.\r\n\r\nNewton was born in England the same year that Galileo died in Italy.\r\nHis greatest work is presented in his celebrated \"Principia,\" or\r\n\"Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy,\" in which the law of\r\ngravitation, the laws of motion, and the mathematical principles of\r\nmechanics are developed. The \"Principia\" was published in 1687, and it\r\nhas ever since been regarded as the corner stone of mathematical and\r\nphysical science.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nSCIENCE IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wonderful advances made in the mathematical, physical, and\r\nastronomical sciences, and the invention of many new scientific\r\ninstruments, together with the publication of improved textbooks and\r\nscientific tables, like those mentioned in the preceding chapter,\r\nstimulated interest in other fields of science at the beginning of the\r\nseventeenth century.\r\n\r\nMedicine, which failed to advance with the astronomical and physical\r\nsciences, began to improve. The Moors had established great medical\r\nschools in Spain, but their teachings were based upon the principles\r\nenunciated by Hippocrates and the Greek schools.\r\n\r\nModern medicine was started upon a firm basis by John Harvey\r\n(1578-1657). Hippocrates taught that the blood was one of the principal\r\nparts of the body--one of the four great \"humors.\" Its movements,\r\nhowever, had never been investigated until Harvey began to study the\r\nfunctions of the arterial system by the dissection of animals. The\r\narteries had been considered as merely air tubes. This was due to the\r\nfact that they were studied only in post-mortem examinations when they\r\nwere empty. The anatomists of the sixteenth century failed to grasp\r\ntheir importance.\r\n\r\nHarvey, who was a penetrating observer, had studied in several\r\ncontinental universities as well as in England, and having an original\r\nmind he determined to test the medical theories which he had been\r\ntaught. His discoveries of the functions of the heart, the arteries,\r\nand the veins were epochal. He did his work so well and made such\r\nsimple, yet telling, demonstrations that he had less difficulty than\r\nhis predecessors in getting his teachings accepted. He was soon\r\nrecognized as the peer of Hippocrates and Galen.\r\n\r\nHarvey died without actually seeing the blood coursing from the\r\narteries into the veins, but four years after his death Marcello\r\nMalpighi (1628-1694) exhibited microscopically the passage of blood\r\ncorpuscles through the minute vessels in the lung of a turtle, on their\r\nway from the heart through the arteries into the veins and returning to\r\nthe heart. The blood circulation was demonstrated at a subsequent date\r\nby applying a microscope to the web of a frog's foot. With low-powered\r\nlenses a good view is obtainable in this manner.\r\n\r\nMany other important discoveries were made by Harvey, particularly\r\nin embryology. He demonstrated that the embryo chicken is formed by\r\ngradual development and processes of differentiation and not, as had\r\npreviously been believed, from a minute perfect chicken.\r\n\r\nMicrobes were discovered in 1683 by Antonius von Leeuwenhoek\r\n(1632-1723), when he was examining some scrapings from his teeth. He\r\nsaw for the first time the long and short rods of bacilli and bacteria,\r\nthe spirillum and the micrococci. He tried means for destroying them\r\nand met with a fair degree of success with a gargle composed of a\r\nmixture of vinegar and hot coffee. This experiment was one of the early\r\nanticipations of antiseptic surgery, which was invented by Lister in\r\nthe nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nA French surgeon, Ambroise Paré (1517-1590) was a pioneer in the\r\ntreatment of wounds. The old method was to use boiling oil. He found\r\nthat by simply cleaning and bandaging wounds he could get better and\r\nquicker results than with hot oil, which was a very painful treatment.\r\nParé used ligaments in stopping hemorrhages, improved the surgery in\r\nharelip and hernia operations and for suprapubic lithotomy. He learned\r\nthe principles of these operations from Peter Franco (1505-1570), an\r\nitinerant surgeon, who had much skill in operations for kidney and\r\nbladder troubles.\r\n\r\nFranz de la Boë (1614-1672), a professor in the university of Leyden,\r\nwho is best known under the name of Sylvius, the discoverer of the\r\nbrain fissure of Sylvius, founded a new school of chemical medicine.\r\nVan Helmont suggested to him the possibility of the stomach being\r\nthe seat of many common disorders. When this was investigated, many\r\nexperiments were made with new medicines. The success of these\r\nexperiments led to a great reform in medical practice. Thomas Willis\r\n(1622-1675), an English physician, completed the development of the\r\ntreatments suggested by Van Helmont and Sylvius as a result of their\r\nstudies of the works of Harvey.\r\n\r\nAnother great English medical genius arose to establish the practice\r\nof medicine on a scientific basis. Thomas Sydenham (1624-1689) founded\r\na school of medicine in accordance with these three principles: (1)\r\nAccurate descriptions of the courses of diseases, (2) following a\r\nfixed method of treatment in each disease, (3) searching for specific\r\nremedies for each diseased condition.\r\n\r\nThe results of these teachings were very pronounced. Before Sydenham's\r\ntime, the only drug used in medicine was an extract of cinchona. The\r\nDutchmen above named and Sydenham discovered many active medicinal\r\nsubstances. Sydenham's principal discovery in materia medica was that\r\nof the properties of laudanum.\r\n\r\nWilliam Gilbert, court physician to Queen Elizabeth of England,\r\nwhile Galileo and Stevin were developing the laws of gravitation and\r\nhydrodynamics, undertook the investigation of the laws of terrestrial\r\nmagnetism and chemistry. His researches in chemistry were extensive and\r\nvaluable. His fame, however, was perpetuated by his study of magnetism\r\nand electricity. He found that the earth is a vast magnet with north\r\nand south poles. His remarkable textbook on magnetism covered many of\r\nthe fundamental facts known to-day. He noted the distinction between\r\nmagnetism and electricity, described electrical charges, the principles\r\nof conductivity and methods for magnetizing iron. Galileo wrote of him:\r\n\"I extremely admire and envy this author.\"\r\n\r\nThe mercurial barometer and its laws were discovered by Evangelista\r\nTorricelli (1608-1647) a student of Galileo. By means of his barometer,\r\nTorricelli was able to make great advances in knowledge relating to\r\nthe physics of the air and to gas pressures, and he investigated the\r\nprinciples of hydraulics. The microscope, telescope, sextant and other\r\ninstruments were greatly improved by him, and his mathematical work\r\nranks only second to his contributions to experimental science.\r\n\r\nThe Torricellian tube, used as a barometer, was a means of creating a\r\nvacuum, which was formed at the top of the column of mercury. Pascal,\r\nthe French mathematician, took up the study of the physics of the\r\nvacuum and published an important work on his own experiments. These\r\nand other experiments made by European scientists prepared the ground\r\nfor, and suggested, the investigations of gases and vacua by Boyle,\r\nMariotte, and others which finally resulted in the invention of the\r\nsteam engine and many other modern machines.\r\n\r\nRobert Boyle (1627-1691) published at Oxford in 1660 a book which\r\ndistinguished between chemical compounds and chemical mixtures. He\r\nadopted the use of the term gas, which was first proposed by Van\r\nHelmont, and made some valuable studies on the physics of boiling and\r\nfreezing. The oxidation of metals, the results of calcination, and\r\nof the fusing of metals and alloys, calculation of the atmospheric\r\npressure, a study of colors as affected by light rays, and\r\ninvestigations in electricity were among the scientific works carried\r\nout by this great experimenter. But his fame rests mainly upon the\r\nresults of his researches on gases.\r\n\r\nBoyle began life as an alchemist and died a well-trained chemist.\r\n\r\nEdme Mariotte, a French contemporary of Boyle's, carried out similar\r\nexperiments and assisted in formulating the physical laws of gases\r\nbearing the names of Boyle and Mariotte.\r\n\r\nA German physicist, Otto von Guericke (1602-1686), also followed up\r\nBoyle's work and invented a new form of air pump. He also carried on\r\nimportant experiments in electricity.\r\n\r\nGilbert, Harvey, Van Helmont, Torricelli, Boyle, Mariotte, and other\r\nsimilar pioneers in scientific methods not only invented numerous\r\nvaluable instruments and wrote suggestive textbooks, but advanced\r\nscientific learning and the love of it by their delightful accounts of\r\ntheir experiments.\r\n\r\nModern education started with these men. Before this period there\r\nhad been a sterile age in which the fundamental purpose of education\r\nwas only to teach men how to protect the soul and to serve God.\r\nThis humanistic principle, however, failed to advance knowledge of\r\nthe laws of nature, and the researches of the scientists gradually\r\ncaused a strong reaction against it. This in turn resulted in further\r\nadvances being made, not only in the sciences, but in all departments\r\nof learning. The way was paved for the era of naturalism, developed\r\nby Hobbes, Locke, Descartes, Voltaire, Kant, Rousseau, and others.\r\nNaturalism aimed at explaining all phenomena in the simplest terms, and\r\ncorrelating all things by universal principles. It has received a great\r\nimpetus in modern times from the Darwinian theory of evolution.\r\n\r\nThe great scientific discoveries of the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies had other important educational effects. They led\r\nto professional specialization and the founding of scientific\r\ninstitutions, schools, and universities. The Lyncean Society of\r\nScientists was founded in Italy in Galileo's time. It subsequently\r\nbecame, in 1657, the Accademia del Cimento.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Society of England was organized about 1645 and chartered in\r\n1662. It did much valuable scientific work from its inception. It has\r\nassisted the foremost scientists in their work, directed scientific\r\nresearches, and financed the printing of scientific records and the\r\ncarrying out of foreign expeditions. Nearly all the leading countries\r\nin the world have formed institutions with similar aims.\r\n\r\nThe chemical discoveries of Boyle attracted widespread attention\r\nand led to investigations started with the view of discovering the\r\nconstitution of matter. Hermann Boerhaave (1668-1738) of Leyden, took\r\nup the study of organic chemistry. Stephen Hales (1677-1761) did\r\nsimilar work in England. Both of these chemists invented valuable\r\nlaboratory processes and instruments. Hales improved the pneumatic\r\ntrough used for collecting gases.\r\n\r\nScientists were now furnished with the telescope, compass, sextant,\r\nmicroscope, barometer, thermometer, air pump, manometer, and other\r\ninstruments so that cellular structures of plants, animals, and\r\ninsects, the microbes and bacteria, the animalculæ found in water and\r\nin the sea, as well as the phenomena of the air, sky, and earth crust\r\ncould now be studied by trained observers. The invention of these\r\ninstruments caused workers to specialize more and more, and completely\r\nsevered science from philosophy, of which it had been an appendage\r\nsince the earliest times.\r\n\r\nThe microscopical investigations of Malpighi, Kircher, Leeuwenhoek,\r\nGrew, and Hooke opened up an immense field for research. They developed\r\nmicroscopical chemistry and anatomy, and changed the prevailing ideas\r\nregarding animal and vegetable tissues. The sciences of mineralogy,\r\nbotany and entomology were benefited and the medical sciences were\r\npractically revolutionized. The first publications of the Royal Society\r\nshow the widespread attention microscopical and telescopic studies were\r\nthen receiving.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                            Copyright, Keystone View Co.\r\n\r\nWEATHER AND ASTRONOMICAL INSTRUMENTS ON THE ROOF OF GREENWICH\r\nOBSERVATORY, ENGLAND]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nCourtesy \"Aeronautics,\" London\r\n\r\nA MOORING TOWER FOR AIRSHIPS, WITH THE R-24 FASTENED HEAD ON]\r\n\r\nFrancis Bacon (1561-1626), René Descartes (1596-1650) and Gottfried\r\nLeibnitz (1646-1716), in England, France, and Germany, respectively,\r\nlent powerful aid to the advance of science at this time.\r\n\r\nBacon's great learning enabled him effectively to describe scientific\r\nmethods and to direct scientific criticism. He attracted general\r\nattention to scientific methods based on inductive processes.\r\n\r\nDescartes, seeing that the world's best intellects had long been\r\nexercised with philosophy and metaphysics, without discovering anything\r\nwith certainty, resolved to accept no beliefs upon the authority of\r\nany name or reputation. He would reach his own conclusions based upon\r\nthe scrupulous examination of data. He hoped to solve the mysteries\r\nof nature by the aid of mathematics and geometry, and developed the\r\nCartesian philosophy.\r\n\r\nThe mathematical works of Descartes are now better known than his\r\ngeneral scientific ideas. He published in 1637 his \"Discourses on\r\nMethod\" and on Geometry. In the last-named work, suggestions are given\r\nfor the development of analytic methods. It has been said of his\r\nformulæ that they are even cleverer than himself. The general use of\r\nhis analytic methods by other mathematicians resulted in the solution\r\nof many scientific problems that had been handed down for centuries as\r\ninsoluble.\r\n\r\nDescartes also advanced algebra. The application of the doctrine of\r\ncurved lines to algebra greatly enlarged the scope of its usefulness.\r\nIn making these innovations, Descartes introduced the methods and\r\nsymbols of modern exponential notation. The English mathematician\r\nWallis was also an important agent in the development of mathematical\r\nnotation. He based his work on the Greek notation and that of Nicolas\r\nChuquet (1484), J. Bürgi, Thomas Harriot (1631), Johann Hudde (1659),\r\nand others. Descartes was familiar with the writings of these scholars\r\nand, undoubtedly, was influenced by them.\r\n\r\nRoberval, Fermat, and Pascal were contemporary mathematicians in France\r\nand left great names in the history of the mathematical sciences. They\r\nall made contributions which permanently enriched mathematics and made\r\nfurther progress in other sciences possible.\r\n\r\nThe geographical sciences now began to attract attention. The new\r\nscientific instruments made it possible to collect data in all parts of\r\nthe world that was needed in unraveling scientific mysteries.\r\n\r\nWilliam Dampier (1653-1715) was one of the pioneers in scientific\r\nvoyages of discovery. In voyages to the Orient and Australasia he\r\ncollected much important data on zoölogy, botany, meteorology, the\r\nwinds, tides, currents, and on fish and sea life. His book on winds\r\nbecame the first great standard work on meteorology.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of spontaneous generation had long held sway in Europe.\r\nThe Greeks entertained it and it was accepted as true in the time of\r\nMartin Luther. Francesco Redi (1626-1697), an Italian biologist, showed\r\nthat when the flesh of dead animals is protected it remains fresh.\r\nThe Abbé Spallanzani (1729-1799) carried Redi's theory further and\r\nshowed that microbes and bacteria do not develop in concoctions which\r\nhave been boiled and sealed. Here we note the beginning of antiseptic\r\nscience.\r\n\r\nUnder the leadership of Bacon in England, Calvin in France, Luther\r\nin Germany, and Knox in Scotland, European thought was being stirred\r\nup while the great discoveries just related were being made. Just\r\nas Boyle's chemical discoveries caused the divorcing of chemistry\r\nfrom alchemy, and the naturalistic philosophy of the times led to\r\nthe specialization of scientists and the breaking off of philosophy\r\nfrom science, so the intellectual awakening aroused by Bacon and his\r\ncontemporaries led to the suppression of belief in witchcraft and to\r\nrevolutionary ideas in religion and ethics.\r\n\r\nLocke endeavored to base a \"rational Christianity\" on the ground of\r\nexperience. Until his times, theology was tangled up with a maze of\r\nphysical problems which dismayed even such intellects as those of\r\nNewton, Hume, and Locke.\r\n\r\nNewton's researches were chiefly based upon mathematical and\r\nastronomical problems. While a student at Cambridge in 1660, he studied\r\nthe works of Descartes, Kepler, Van Schooten, Barrow, and particularly\r\nthose of the Greek and British mathematicians. The works of J. Wallis\r\nwere very valuable to him. The \"Arithmetic of Affinities\" of Wallis\r\ndrew his attention to astronomical problems and thus led to his great\r\ntriumphs later on.\r\n\r\nNewton's \"Principia\" has already been referred to as being one of the\r\ngreatest works of the intellect ever produced.\r\n\r\nThe result of Newton's meditation upon the nature of the central\r\nforce that keeps the planets in their courses was that he furnished a\r\nmathematical basis for Kepler's laws by proving that if the planets\r\ndescribe elliptical orbits about the sun, the force acting toward the\r\nsun, keeping them in revolution, must vary inversely as the square of\r\nthe distance. On the revolution of the moon around the earth he found a\r\npractical confirmation of this law of gravitational attraction. He then\r\ntook up the study of motion in general and showed that every particle\r\nof matter attracts every other particle in accordance with the same\r\nprinciple of inverse squares.\r\n\r\nBotanical gardens were established in Padua in 1545, and not long after\r\nin Pisa, Leyden, Paris, and London. Much attention was devoted to\r\nmedicinal plants, and numerous herbal books were published. Malpighi,\r\nGrew, and Camerarius (1665-1721) published works on botany and plant\r\nmorphology. Ray and Linnæus (1707-1778) studied the classification of\r\nplants and compiled textbooks of descriptive botany.\r\n\r\nBuffon (1707-1788) published his famous \"Natural History of Animals\"\r\nwhich did for zoölogy what the works of Linnæus did for botany.\r\n\r\nLooking backward, we can now see that all scientific knowledge has\r\nbeen gained by the trial and error method and cumulative analyses of\r\na multitude of observations. Progress is not made uniformly but in a\r\nrecurrent, cyclic manner. Reactions follow advances, but in the end all\r\ngoes forward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nPRELUDE TO MODERN SCIENCE--THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the eighteenth century opened science had begun to make men think,\r\nand the works of the great scientists had changed the trend of thought\r\non all sides. Liberty of conscience, of worship, and of opportunity\r\nwere demanded, as well as representative government, economic freedom,\r\nand individual equality before the law. Men wanted to be free agents.\r\nThe philosophical writings of Berkeley, Locke, Hume, Spinoza, Voltaire,\r\nRousseau, and others supplemented the books of the scientists and\r\npromoted rational thinking. Syllogistic reasoning displaced the\r\npractice of accepting beliefs upon authority. This change in public\r\nthought reacted most favorably upon science.\r\n\r\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibnitz (1646-1716) conceived matter as a plurality\r\nof simple forces. Many kinds of matter, he said, exist. There is no\r\nsingle natural force, but an infinite number. Each force is represented\r\nby some individual substance. Force is indivisible, immaterial, and\r\nunextended. Simple forces he called essential forms, units, atoms, or\r\nmonads. The monads are not mathematical points, nor physical points.\r\nReal points are metaphysical. In other words, Leibnitz created a\r\nphilosophy of eternal force atoms.\r\n\r\nThe Greeks were taught by Leucippus, Empedocles and Anaxagoras that\r\nmatter is formed of atoms. Space is infinite; atoms are indivisible.\r\nAtoms are in a continuous state of activity. Atoms constitute worlds\r\nand planets. Falling through space they give rise to eddying motions\r\nby mutual impact. Many philosophers rejected these views. Throughout\r\nthe ages, however, they were learned by students and when Leibnitz\r\nadvanced his new atomic theory, the world was ready to consider it.\r\nThe Leibnitzian monads were like Plato's ideas--eternal purposes.\r\nAristotle held that monads are absolute, indivisible beings. Leibnitz\r\nsuggested that each monad is in process of evolution and realizes its\r\nnature through inner necessity. It is not determined from without. Each\r\nform of matter existed in germ in an embryo. Nothing in a monad can be\r\nlost, and future stages are predetermined in the earlier stages. Each\r\nmonad is charged with the past and big with the future. The biologists\r\nat this period generally accepted this incasement theory. Caspar F.\r\nWolff suggested, in 1759, that there is an epigenesis or a progressive\r\nevolution and differentiation of organs from a homogeneous primitive\r\ngerm. This view did not meet with approval until Darwin published his\r\ngreat discoveries in the middle of the last century.\r\n\r\nThe history of the atomic theories furnishes a clear illustration of\r\nthe long period of preparation that great scientific ideas must pass\r\nthrough before they are united by a generalizing genius of exceptional\r\ncapacity and launched in the form of a new theory.\r\n\r\nModern mathematical science grew out of the analytical geometry\r\nof Descartes. He showed that the true method for the discovery of\r\nscientific facts was to accept nothing as true which was clearly not\r\nrecognizable as true. All assumptions should be proved. Each difficulty\r\nshould be separately studied. No intermediate steps should be skipped,\r\nand details should be methodically enumerated. Thoughts must be guided\r\nin an orderly manner, beginning with the simplest characteristics of\r\nan object and proceeding in a logical sequence to the most complicated\r\naspects of each subject. Descartes carried out his own rules in\r\nhis work. His improvements in the differential calculus, and those\r\nin the integral calculus made by Cavalieri, and in the calculus\r\nof probabilities by Pascal and Fermat, furnished scientists with\r\ninstruments capable of solving almost every physical problem met with\r\nin their investigations.\r\n\r\nOne of the first results of the new analytical methods was the\r\nestablishment of the science of optics.\r\n\r\nNewton demonstrated that white light is composed of rays of various\r\ncolors, and that the color reflected by any object is due to the\r\nability of the object to reflect certain rays while absorbing the rest.\r\nThe Dutch physicist, Huygens, championed the undulatory or wave theory\r\nof light. Refraction was explained by both Newton and Huygens, and the\r\nlatter, while studying the double refraction of crystals of Iceland\r\nspar, discovered the phenomena of polarization.\r\n\r\nBoyle's chemical discoveries led to much research in chemistry. Black,\r\nBergman and Van Helmont investigated the properties of carbonic acid\r\ngas.\r\n\r\nJoseph Black treated limestone with acid and collected the gas evolved\r\nin a Hales pneumatic trough. He weighed the gas and the remainder of\r\nthe limestone, finding that what the limestone lost was equivalent to\r\nthe weight of the gas. He then reversed the process and succeeded in\r\nmaking chalk from a solution of lime. This simple experiment paved the\r\nway for chemical analysis and syntheses which have added profoundly to\r\nour knowledge of the composition of matter.\r\n\r\nBergman tested Black's gas with litmus and found it gave an acid\r\nreaction and in 1779 Lavoisier demonstrated that it consisted of carbon\r\nand oxygen.\r\n\r\nPriestley and Cavendish, both English chemists, then took up this\r\nstudy. Cavendish treated iron, tin, zinc, and other metals with\r\nsulphuric acid and discovered a new gas which he termed hydrogen.\r\n\r\nRutherford discovered nitrogen in 1772 and Priestley isolated nitric\r\noxide, and in 1774 discovered oxygen. In the course of his experiment\r\nPriestley also discovered ammonia, sulphur dioxide and other chemicals.\r\n\r\nHis greatest achievements, however, were the isolation and recognition\r\nof oxygen, and the discovery of the composition of water. Following up\r\nthese discoveries, he noted that the air is not a simple elementary\r\nsubstance, but a mixture of nitrogen and oxygen with several impure\r\ngases. The work of this great chemist became as fruitful in the\r\nchemical field as that of Newton in physics, astronomy, and mathematics.\r\n\r\nCarl Wilhelm Scheele, a Swede, carried out many experiments which\r\nresulted in the discovery of tartaric acid, the decomposition of silver\r\nchloride by light, magnesium nitrate, magnesia, microcosmic salt, and\r\nsulphureted hydrogen, chlorine, hydrofluoric, and other inorganic\r\nacids. He also discovered the following organic acids: lactic, gallic,\r\npyrogallic, oxalic, citric, malic, mucic and uric. He isolated\r\nglycerin and sugar of milk and determined the nature of hydrocyanic\r\nacid, borax, plumbago, Prussian blue, and other chemicals. He invented\r\nmany new chemical and laboratory processes. Scheele was an apothecary's\r\nassistant and lived in poverty. But although his experiments were\r\nconducted under disadvantageous circumstances his discoveries ranked\r\nhim as the greatest chemist of his time and one of the greatest\r\nchemical experimenters of all time.\r\n\r\nCavendish established the proportions of the constituents of air,\r\ndemonstrated the nature of water and its volumetric composition. The\r\ncharacter of the experiments conducted by Cavendish, his elegant\r\nmethods of weighing, measuring and calculating have caused him to\r\nbe looked upon as the founder of systematic chemistry. He was more\r\nscientific in his methods than the brilliant Lavoisier, and much more\r\nlearned and philosophical than the practical Scheele.\r\n\r\nWhile the chemists were making these great advances there were\r\nimportant developments in physical science. Benjamin Franklin\r\n(1706-1790), the first American scientist to acquire world-wide\r\nfame, announced that lightning was an electrical phenomenon. In\r\n1752 he showed by his famous kite experiments that atmospheric and\r\nmachine-generated electric charges are of a like nature.\r\n\r\nFranklin suggested to Cavendish certain electrical experiments with\r\na view to studying the electric force between two charges. These\r\nexperiments led Cavendish to the discovery of the law of electric\r\nattraction between charged bodies. Franklin subsequently discovered the\r\nlaw of conservation of an electric charge.\r\n\r\nCharles Augustin Coulomb (1736-1806) rendered great service to\r\nelectrical experimentation. He resurveyed the experiments of Cavendish,\r\nPriestley, and other pioneer electricians, and established a theory of\r\nmolecular magnetization which provided a working formula to explain\r\nelectrical currents and magnetic fields.\r\n\r\nSimeon Denis Poisson (1781-1840) discovered the law of induced\r\nmagnetism which bears his name.\r\n\r\nLuigi Galvani (1737-1798) observed that the limbs of a frog are\r\nconvulsed whenever they are connected up through the nerves and muscles\r\nwith a metallic arc formed from more than one metal. He thought the\r\nconvulsions were due to a peculiar fluid which he called galvanism, or\r\nanimal electricity.\r\n\r\nAnother Italian, Alessandro Volta (1745-1827) discovered and explained\r\nthe theory of the voltaic pile.\r\n\r\nNicholson and Carlisle discovered frictional electricity while William\r\nCruickshank showed that a voltaic current decomposes solutions of\r\nmetallic salts. William Hyde Wollaston used Cruickshank's discovery\r\nto prove that frictional and voltaic electric currents are identical.\r\nHumphry Davy (1778-1829) in 1807 established a new voltaic theory\r\nwhich combined the chemical and contact theories previously held, and\r\nshowed that electrical and chemical attractions are produced by similar\r\ncauses. Chemical affinity he found to be an essentially electrical\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nFrancis Hawksbee, in 1705, communicated to the Royal Society a\r\nmonograph which showed that when common air is passed over mercury in\r\na well-exhausted receiver an electric light is produced. This was\r\nthe first demonstration of the availability of electricity for the\r\nproduction of light.\r\n\r\nDufay (1699-1739) described positive and negative electric currents.\r\n\r\nWatson determined, for the Royal Society, the velocity of an electric\r\ncurrent and found it practically instantaneous.\r\n\r\nThese, and numerous lesser, discoveries did for electricity what\r\nthe chemical discoveries of Priestley, Cavendish, Scheele, Boyle,\r\nLavoisier, and others had done for chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe numerous voyages of discovery in the eighteenth century helped to\r\ndevelop the geographical sciences. Special expeditions were fitted out\r\nfor the acquirement of geographical knowledge without any thought of\r\ntrading profits. The Jesuits carried out a valuable survey of China and\r\nMongolia early in the century. A Danish scientific expedition studied\r\nArabia, the results of which were published by Niebuhr in 1772. James\r\nBruce visited Abyssinia with the view of solving the ancient problem\r\nof the source of the Nile. Mungo Park studied the course of the Niger.\r\nCaptain James Cook led a scientific expedition to Tahiti with the\r\nobject of making astronomical observations. This resulted in one of\r\nthe greatest and most valuable voyages of discovery in history. Cook\r\ndetermined the westernmost point of America in 1778 and his accounts\r\nof Bering Sea and Alaska revived interest in the Polar seas, which\r\nresulted in numerous Arctic and Antarctic expeditions yielding rich\r\nscientific returns.\r\n\r\nThe Hudson's Bay Company sent out many investigators to determine the\r\ncharacteristics and resources of Arctic America. The Russians did the\r\nsame for their own northern lands.\r\n\r\nThese activities of geographical investigators led to improved methods\r\nof navigation, nautical surveying, sounding and shipbuilding, besides\r\nsupplying an enormous amount of scientific data.\r\n\r\nThe British naval authorities pointed out to King Charles II the need\r\nfor correct nautical tables. Flamsteed, one of the leading astronomers\r\nof the day, was appointed Astronomer Royal in 1675, with the definite\r\nobject of producing a new catalogue of star positions, tide tables, and\r\nother nautical data. He immediately founded the Greenwich observatory,\r\nwhich has supplied the world with data for the navigator.\r\n\r\nBradley, a successor of Flamsteed at Greenwich, made many important\r\nastronomical discoveries while carrying on the star maps. He discovered\r\nthe aberration of light and the mutation of the earth's axis.\r\n\r\nLocaille studied the parallax of the sun and made numerous stellar\r\nobservations at the Cape of Good Hope in 1751. He located the positions\r\nof 10,000 stars in the southern hemisphere.\r\n\r\nMeasurements were made in Peru, Lapland, and elsewhere to discover\r\ndata regarding the earth's curvature. Pendulum observations to detect\r\nvariations of gravity were made in many countries. Maskelyne, the\r\nastronomer royal, made observations on the transit of Venus at St.\r\nHelena in 1761. On this expedition he perfected the method of finding\r\nlongitude at sea by lunar distances.\r\n\r\nSir William Herschel discovered the planet Uranus in 1781, and\r\nsubsequently found its satellites. Many star groups, double stars and\r\nnebulæ were discovered by him and he found that the solar system is\r\ntraveling through space in the direction of a point in or near the\r\nconstellation of Hercules.\r\n\r\nGreenwich observatory was publishing at the end of the eighteenth\r\ncentury the Nautical Almanac, and annual reports on star and\r\nmeteorological observations as well as important astronomical\r\nmonographs. Similar publications were founded in the next century in\r\nFrance, Germany, and Italy.\r\n\r\nThe discoveries in mathematics during the eighteenth century included\r\nthe differential, integral, and other forms of the calculus,\r\ndifferential equations, and various formulæ for dynamics, mechanics,\r\nand physical and astronomical calculations. Euler, Lagrange, Laplace,\r\nD'Alembert, and Carnot were prominent mathematical investigators.\r\n\r\nHeat in earlier times had been regarded as an imponderable substance\r\ncalled caloric which was supposed to be emitted by hot and absorbed\r\nby cold bodies. Thus the expansion of mercury was explained by the\r\naddition of caloric and not by the increase of distance between\r\nthe molecules. Francis Bacon and the Scotch chemist Black did the\r\npreliminary work which enabled Count Rumford finally to establish\r\nthe true theory of heat. Watt and Newcomen were attracted by these\r\nstudies and reduced their theories to practice in the steam engine.\r\nBlack described specific and latent heat and invented, and used, the\r\ncalorimeter bearing his name.\r\n\r\nHall invented an achromatic lens for telescopes in 1733, and Dollond,\r\nanother English optician, improved achromatic lenses and made, in 1758,\r\nachromatic telescope objectives. The lenses were primarily designed\r\nfor astronomical telescopes, but they were also applied to microscopes\r\nand other scientific instruments, resulting in improvements in our\r\nknowledge of light.\r\n\r\nThe voyages of discovery, in this century, encouraged study of zoölogy\r\nand natural history subjects generally, including mineralogy and\r\ngeology.\r\n\r\nHooke, Ray, and Woodward made collections of rocks and fossils in\r\nEngland and advanced hypotheses to explain their origins. Lazzaro\r\nMoro suggested that fossils must have been deposited in rocks when\r\nthey were being formed. He also distinguished rock formations by the\r\ncharacteristic fossils found in them. Hutton and Smith then made\r\nscientific studies of English rocks, fossils, and earth sculpture, and\r\nprepared the materials for the subsequent brilliant discoveries of\r\nLyell.\r\n\r\nThe first governmental school of mines was established in Freiberg,\r\nSaxony, in 1775. This institution, and others which were afterward\r\nestablished in different countries, led to an intensive study of the\r\ngeological and metallurgical sciences, which eventuated in great\r\nadvances during the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nAristotle and Theophrastus in early times, Gesner in the sixteenth\r\ncentury, Ray, Grew, Malpighi and Willughby in the seventeenth century,\r\nhad been the writers of the principal textbooks on zoölogy. Buffon\r\n(1707-1785) and Linnæus (1707-1778) were the founders of modern natural\r\nhistory in the eighteenth century. Buffon described species, while\r\nLinnæus classified them. Linnæus named _Homo sapiens_ as a distinct\r\nspecies in the order of primates which includes apes, lemurs, and bats,\r\nand fixed man's place in nature.\r\n\r\nThe medical sciences were revolutionized by the researches of\r\nEdward Jenner. He applied the scientific methods of the chemists,\r\nmathematicians, and astronomers to medicine and through accurate\r\nobservation, skillful experimentation, careful generalization, and\r\nthorough verification, founded preventive medicine. His discovery of\r\nvaccination as a preventive for smallpox, communicated to the Royal\r\nSociety in a very interesting paper in 1798, was the pioneer of the\r\nmany brilliant advances of our day.\r\n\r\nThe Freiberg School of Mines, the Woolwich Observatory, the School\r\nof Civil Engineering in Paris (1747), the Universities of Göttingen\r\n(1737), Bonn (1777), Brussels (1781), Yale (1701) and Princeton (1746)\r\nwere founded in this century.\r\n\r\nModern industrialism began in the final part of this century.\r\nThe invention of the steam engine by Watt resulted in giving the\r\ngreatest impulse to material civilization the world ever experienced.\r\nThis invention was the direct result of the experimental work of\r\nBoyle, Newton, Black, Cavendish, Davy, Priestley, and Lavoisier. It\r\nillustrates how the scientific discoveries of one generation furnish\r\nthe data for the advancement of knowledge by the next generation and\r\nhow a single invention may change the whole aspect of life, giving\r\nemployment for vast numbers of people, developing settlement in foreign\r\nlands, starting new industries, and extending the fields of commerce.\r\nThe history of the development of the steam engine from the results of\r\na few basic physical researches by British scientists forms one of the\r\ngrandest stories in the history of science.\r\n\r\nThe new aspect assumed by the world as a result of the great scientific\r\ndiscoveries and the increases in industry and commerce which followed\r\nthem seemed strange to the people who were unused to rapid progress.\r\nThere was a disturbed feeling akin to fear abroad while the new ideas\r\nwere being popularized and disseminated throughout the world. The\r\nmovement in favor of enlightenment was strongest in France because of\r\nthe social, political, and religious oppression of the people. It ended\r\nin the French Revolution, which strengthened the respect for reason and\r\nhuman rights throughout the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL SCIENCES IN THE NINETEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the nineteenth century, the path of scientific discovery might\r\nalmost be represented by a vertical line. Never before was such\r\nrapid and marvelous progress made. The releasing of the mind from\r\nthe oppressive restrictions of earlier conservative ages liberated\r\nthe intellectual energies of mankind. A new idealistic philosophy\r\nsupplanted that of an earlier period and universal attention was given\r\nto science and material things. Amidst these changes social science was\r\ndevolved, and, with it, the study of psychology.\r\n\r\nBut it was the physical sciences which most felt the stimulus of the\r\nnew rationalistic spirit.\r\n\r\nThe relationships between physical magnitudes are established by\r\nmeasurements. When these are accurately ascertained, questions\r\nregarding their variable functions can be solved by mathematical\r\nprinciples. Physics is thus linked with mathematics through\r\nmeasurements. The more science advances, the greater is the accuracy\r\nneeded in physical measurements. The strictness and clearness of\r\nexperimentation which has been attained in physics has given birth to a\r\nscience of measurement, which has its own instruments, rules, methods,\r\nand formulæ.\r\n\r\nMeasurement of length is one of the bases of physics. It is a relative\r\noperation carried out by comparing the length of one body with that of\r\nanother. Standards of length are preserved by a Bureau of Weights and\r\nMeasures in most countries. Delambre, a French authority on the decimal\r\nsystem of measures, taught at the beginning of the nineteenth century\r\nthat magnitudes as small as the hundredth of a millimeter are incapable\r\nof observation. The International Bureau of Weights and Measures now\r\nguarantees to determine two or three ten-thousandths of a millimeter.\r\nSo much has the science of measurement progressed in a century.\r\n\r\nThe undulations of light rays are used for determining standard\r\nlengths. Michelson and Benoit measured a standard length of ten\r\ncentimeters, in 1894, in terms of the wave lengths of the red, green,\r\nand blue radiations of cadmium, and then in terms of the French\r\nstandard meter. These experiments yielded very accurate results.\r\n\r\nThe measurement of mass is another important base of physics. Mass is\r\nthe quantity of matter in a body and the action which gravity exerts\r\non mass is called weight. Weight does not depend entirely upon mass,\r\nbut also upon the position of the body weighed, because when the\r\nbody is weighed in one place and reweighed in another, there will be\r\na difference in the force of gravity due to change of latitude and\r\nof altitude. National standards of mass have been made of alloys of\r\niridium and platinum.\r\n\r\nMany remarkable measurements of time, temperature, and physical\r\nconstants were carried out during the century.\r\n\r\nHigh and low temperature charts were completed, showing temperatures in\r\nthe air, the earth, and the sea. Instruments and methods were devised\r\nfor measuring any temperature whether of high furnace gases or low\r\nfreezing mixtures.\r\n\r\nThe measuring units of mass, length, time, and temperature are\r\nfundamental, others like velocity, acceleration, power, and area are\r\nreferred to them. For that reason the latter are called derived units.\r\nMany of these are important and call for accurate determinations.\r\n\r\nOne of the first achievements of the century was the establishment of\r\nthe doctrine of the conservation of energy.\r\n\r\nFrancis Bacon had suggested that motion is a phenomenon of heat, and\r\nNewton had divined the principle of the conservation of energy, but\r\nit was Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, who discovered the nature of\r\nfriction and made the first estimate of the mechanical equivalent of\r\nheat. Sir Humphry Davy showed that two pieces of ice could be melted by\r\nsimply rubbing them together, in a vacuum. But he failed to draw the\r\ngreat inference that this experiment warranted.\r\n\r\nIf he had observed that the heat could not have been supplied by the\r\nice because ice is an absorber of heat, he would have anticipated the\r\ngreat work done by James P. Joule, an English physicist, who published\r\nthe results of many experiments carried out by him prior to 1843. His\r\ntask was to find the exact mechanical equivalent of heat.\r\n\r\nHis best results were secured by dropping a mass of lead from a\r\nmeasured height and using the energy generated during the descent to\r\noperate a revolving paddle in a dish of measured water. Delicate\r\nthermometers recorded the increase of temperature in the water and\r\nshowed that the descent of 424 grams of lead through a distance of one\r\nmeter, or one gram of lead through 424 meters, generated sufficient\r\nheat to raise one gram of water one degree centigrade (1° C.).\r\n\r\nOtherwise expressed, a fall of 772 lbs. of lead through a distance of\r\n1 foot, or 1 lb. of lead through 772 feet, raises the temperature of 1\r\nlb. of water one degree Fahrenheit (1° F.). These 772 foot-pounds, or\r\n424 gram-meters, represent the mechanical equivalent of heat upon which\r\nso many important theories have been based. But Joule's equivalent\r\nwas determined for common air temperatures whereas the specific heat\r\nof water increases with the temperature so that the value of the\r\nequivalent rises with increased temperatures. Osborne Reynolds, in\r\n1897, found the mean equivalent for temperatures between the freezing\r\nand boiling points to be 777 foot-pounds.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of Joule's equivalent established a relationship between\r\nmotion or mechanical work performed and the amount of heat generated\r\nwhen work is completely expanded in friction. The same relationships\r\ncontinue good when the work is transformed by indirect means as by\r\ngenerating electric currents or expanding gases. The multitude of\r\nelegant experiments used to confirm the truth of Joule's law showed\r\nthat heat is not a substance, or calorie, but a purely mechanical\r\neffect. This great discovery of the relation of friction and heat\r\nlies at the basis of electricity, molecular physics, and chemistry,\r\nand is the source of the formulæ used by engineers in designing power\r\nmachinery. The internal combustion engine is largely a result of the\r\ndiscovery of Joule's equivalent and the physical theories derived from\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThis great discovery caused a new theory of matter to be developed.\r\nDalton had suggested, when applying the atomic theory to chemistry,\r\nthat when two elements combine to form a third substance, it is\r\nprobable that one atom of one element joins itself to one atom of the\r\nother, unless some exceptional condition exists. When water is formed\r\nby bringing oxygen and hydrogen together, he supposed that one atom\r\nof oxygen combined with one atom of hydrogen. Gay-Lussac subsequently\r\nproved that not only does one volume of oxygen combine with two volumes\r\nof hydrogen (not one as Dalton believed) in the production of water,\r\nbut that nitric and carbonic acid gases combine with ammonia gas in the\r\nratio of 1:1 or 1:2. He also demonstrated that one volume of nitrogen\r\nunited with three of hydrogen form ammonia, and that carbonic oxide\r\nburning in a mass of oxygen consumes half its volume of oxygen. He\r\nconcluded from these and other facts that gases always combine together\r\nin simple proportions by volume and that the apparent contraction of\r\nvolume they show on combining bears a similar simple relationship to\r\nthe volume of one or more of the gases.\r\n\r\nAvogadro, working on Gay-Lussac's experimental data, suggested that\r\nthe number of integral molecules in any gas is always the same for\r\nequal volumes, or is always proportional to the volumes. He also\r\nsuggested that equal volumes of different gases at the same pressure\r\nand temperature contain the same number of molecules. Experiments\r\non alcohol made by Williamson raised doubts as to the validity of\r\nAvogadro's hypotheses when applied to chemical combinations. These\r\ndoubts were cleared in 1860, when the new chemical atomic weights and\r\nformulæ were introduced into English textbooks.\r\n\r\nThe molecular theory of matter derived from these experiments supposes\r\nthat all visible forms of matter are aggregations of simpler and\r\nsmaller chemical elements. Mendeléeff and Newlands showed that the\r\nphysical and chemical properties of the elements are functions of their\r\natomic weights.\r\n\r\nInvestigations of radioactivity and the observations based upon the\r\npassage of electric currents through gases have recently modified our\r\nviews with respect to the atomic theory, but these points will be dealt\r\nwith in the chapter dealing with radiation.\r\n\r\nQuestions regarding the eventual loss of energy in matter are best\r\nstudied in gases. A considerable number of important investigations\r\nare now being carried on in Europe with the view of tracing the\r\ninterchanges of molecular energies in gas molecules. Maxwell and other\r\ninvestigators found long ago that the motion of molecules cannot go on\r\nperpetually. The energy of motion will in time be frittered away by\r\nfriction, air resistance, collisions with other molecules, vibrations\r\nset up by collisions, and other molecular movements. It has been found\r\nthat the energy which is dissipated by air resistance is transformed\r\ninto energy in the air. That which is lost by collisions is converted\r\ninto internal vibrations within each molecule. The question now arises\r\nas to what effects are exerted on a gas. It involves the effects of the\r\ncommunicated internal molecular vibrations and their transference of\r\nenergy to the surrounding medium. What is known as the Quantum dynamic\r\ntheory has been proposed to account for this phenomena. Quantum\r\ndynamics appear to be distinct from the Newtonian.\r\n\r\nCarnot and Clausius discovered that the motive power of heat is\r\nindependent of the agents brought into play for its realization. The\r\nmotive power of a waterfall depends, for example, on its height and\r\non the quantity of water falling within a given time. Clausius stated\r\nthe Carnot idea in mechanical terms by saying: That in a series of\r\ntransformations, in which the final is identical with the initial\r\nstage, it is impossible for heat to pass from a colder to a warmer body\r\nunless some other accessory phenomenon occurs at the same time. A heat\r\nmotor, which, after a series of transformations, returns to its initial\r\nstate, can only supply work, or power, if there exist two sources of\r\nheat, and if a certain quantity of heat is given to one of the sources\r\nwhich can never be the hotter of the two. The output of a reversible\r\nmachine working between two given temperatures is greater than that\r\nof any nonreversible engine, and it is the same for all reversible\r\nmachines working between these two temperatures.\r\n\r\nClausius showed that this principle conduces to the definition of an\r\nabsolute scale of temperature and there is another factor assisting\r\nin restoring physical equilibrium which he termed entropy. It is a\r\nvariable which, like pressure or volume, serves concurrently with\r\nanother variable to define the state of a body.\r\n\r\nThese discoveries of Carnot and Clausius showed the impossibility of\r\nfinding a source of perpetual motion and helped to solve many of the\r\ndifficulties in securing efficiency from internal combustion engines.\r\nIndustrial, as well as scientific results of immense importance have\r\ndeveloped from these principles.\r\n\r\nTheories on the compressible fluids and elastic equilibrium were\r\ndeveloped as the result of work done between 1875 and 1896 by J.\r\nW. Gibbs, Helmholtz, Duhem, and others on internal thermodynamic\r\npotentials. These theories have proved of incalculable value in\r\nelucidating electrical and radiation phenomena.\r\n\r\nAnother discovery of Gibbs, made in 1876, has also had brilliant\r\nresults. It is known as the Phase Law. The homogeneous substances\r\ninto which a material system is divided is called a phase. Carbonate\r\nof lime, lime, and carbonic acid gas are the three phases of a system\r\nwhich comprises Iceland spar partially dissociated into lime and\r\ncarbonic acid gas. The number of phases, combined with the number of\r\nindependent bodies entering into the reactions, fixes the general form\r\nof the law of equilibrium of the system. This discovery of Gibbs has\r\nresulted in greatly extending the field of physics. It is of importance\r\nin molecular and atomic investigations, in osmosis, electrolysis, and\r\nin most questions dealing with thermodynamics.\r\n\r\nLight is generally defined as the sense impression received by the eye.\r\nIt was formerly believed that it was caused by streams of corpuscles\r\nemitted by the source of light. This was known as the emission theory.\r\nEarly in the nineteenth century, the undulatory displaced the emission\r\ntheory. According to this, light is a transverse vibratory motion\r\nextended longitudinally through the ether.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Faraday, Maxwell, Fresnel, Hamilton, Green, and\r\nothers suggested that the undulatory theory required for its validity a\r\nnew medium different from the atmospheric air and from every substance\r\nknown to man. Just as the results of investigations into reflection,\r\nrefraction, diffraction, and polarization showed that the old\r\ncorpuscular theory of light was untenable, so these experiments seemed\r\nto cast doubt upon both the undulatory and emission theories.\r\n\r\nFresnel, when studying problems in polarization, noticed that a theory\r\nof light proposed by Hooke appeared to be true. Hooke asserted that\r\nlight vibrations are not longitudinal but transverse.\r\n\r\nFresnel found by his experiments that the idea of longitudinal\r\nvibrations acting along the line of propagation in the direction of\r\nthe rays would not explain the polarization changes in light. They\r\nsuggested that there was a transverse movement perpendicular to the\r\nray. When Fresnel's researches were published, physicists realized\r\nthat if the transverse direction of luminous vibrations was denied\r\nthe undulatory movement of light would also be denied. Now transverse\r\nvibrations cannot exist in any medium resembling a fluid, because it\r\nis characteristic of fluids that, so long as the volume continues\r\nconstant, its different parts can be displaced without the appearance\r\nof any reaction. This necessitates the assumption that light needs a\r\nsolid body for its transmission and Lord Kelvin asserted that this body\r\nmust be a solid more rigid than steel.\r\n\r\nWhen the vibratory theory was accepted, it became necessary to\r\ninvestigate the nature of the ether and to determine its characteristic\r\nproperties. Neumann, MacCullagh, Green, and Stokes then developed an\r\nelastic solid theory of the ether.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Lord Rayleigh, Lorentz, Drude, Larmor, and others\r\nsuggested that light is identical with electromagnetic disturbances\r\nand, consequently, is an electrical phenomenon.\r\n\r\nSome of the finest developments in physics during the nineteenth\r\ncentury were in the realm of electricity. They resulted in an enormous\r\nextension of the use of electricity in industry and commerce and led to\r\nthe investigation of radioactivities of various kinds and these in turn\r\nare developing investigations of a most brilliant character.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE NATURAL SCIENCES\r\n\r\n\r\nManifestations of animal life are everywhere visible. They may be\r\nseen on mountain peaks, in desert plains, and by the seashores. Even\r\nthe bleak arctic ice fields have their faunas. This extraordinary\r\ndistribution of life has attracted attention since the dawn of history.\r\nPrimitive man, by his often beautiful cave drawings, indicated that he\r\nstudied intimately the wild life surrounding him. The basic facts of\r\nnatural history were studied by the early peoples of the Near East.\r\nThe Greeks prepared many books on natural history and anticipated\r\nmodern evolutionary theories. The natural sciences, however, made\r\nslow progress until toward the end of the eighteenth century when\r\nLinnæus and Buffon began their great works. When the nineteenth century\r\nopened, the broader fields of nature were segregated, classified,\r\nand described. Linnæus took broad views regarding the principles of\r\nclassification based upon general structure, and his work was enlarged\r\nand improved by Cuvier.\r\n\r\nBuffon contributed suggestions regarding the probable mutability of\r\nspecies with respect to changes in environment, and improved on the\r\nold Greek evolutionary ideas by formulating a definite theory of the\r\ncauses of mutability. He was an important agent in promoting the modern\r\ntheories of evolution in zoölogy and botany, which have done more than\r\nanything else to augment our knowledge of terrestrial life.\r\n\r\nThe numerous scientific exploring expeditions in the eighteenth and\r\nnineteenth centuries collected an enormous amount of data regarding\r\nanimals and animal life. Early in the nineteenth century this data\r\nwas worked up and classified. It soon became apparent that the range\r\nof any given species of animal is strictly limited. A new science,\r\nthat of the geographical distribution of life, was developed. This has\r\nbeen very fruitful in defining the true home areas of all species of\r\nanimals, insects, birds, and fish, and locating their principal paths\r\nof migration.\r\n\r\nThe world has been divided into about a dozen terrestrial life\r\nregions, subregions and transitional regions. These have been mapped\r\nand described. The work of Dr. A. R. Wallace, in 1876, showed the\r\ncomparative importance and extent of these life zones and their\r\nvariable richness in zoölogical forms, the relationships of the species\r\nin different zones, and their degrees of isolation. The descriptions of\r\nthese great geographical zones fill many interesting volumes and cover\r\nall the important forms of existing life.\r\n\r\nThe naturalists who studied particular zones, or classes of animals,\r\nfrequently did extraordinary work. The bird studies in North America,\r\nrecorded in a series of wonderful paintings by Audubon, and the studies\r\nof Fürbringer and other naturalists, are comparable with Wallace's\r\ngreat book on the Geographical Distribution of Animals, published in\r\n1876.\r\n\r\nThe morphological researches of Parker, Huxley, Quatrefages, Owen, and\r\nothers revolutionized many of the subdivisions of natural history and\r\nled to important discoveries in biology.\r\n\r\nThe effects of climate upon the development, migration, and decline\r\nof species and upon the extension and upbuilding of civilization have\r\nbeen minutely studied. Kropotkin showed that climatic changes in\r\nAsia drove the hordes of native tribes into Europe at early periods.\r\nThey were forced to migrate on account of droughts leading to a food\r\nshortage. Many historical events have been shaped by climatic factors.\r\nJust as men who inhabit dry districts are usually nomads on account of\r\ntheir need of seeking new food supplies, so animals and insects are\r\nforced to migrate for a similar reason. The life changes wrought by\r\ndisease epidemics under climatic influences have also been studied and\r\nhave shed much light upon the origin and development of many organs\r\nand upon the habits of animals. Some of the chief inferences arising\r\nfrom investigations on the effects of climatic variations on life are\r\nthat certain types of climate favor the development of certain animal\r\nspecies; certain climates have prevailed in historical times in centers\r\nwhere civilization flourished greatly. Therefore it may be presumed\r\nthat definite climatic conditions are required for the specific\r\ndevelopment of each type of species and for each kind of civilization.\r\nJust as history shows that one of the many conditions of human progress\r\nhas changed repeatedly from century to century on account of variations\r\nin climatic factors, so these stimuli have, from the earliest times,\r\nswayed and modified all classes of organic life. Climate serves\r\nto develop, retard, or extinguish animal characteristics, habits,\r\nand development. The study of the rôle of climate in modifying\r\nliving conditions has disclosed data which throws much light on the\r\nphilosophical problems surrounding organic life, its laws and progress.\r\n\r\nThe voyage of the _Beagle_ in 1831, for a scientific cruise to South\r\nAmerica, with Charles Darwin aboard as naturalist; that of the Ross\r\nAntarctic expedition in 1839, with Sir W. J. Hooker as botanist; that\r\nof the _Rattlesnake_ for Australia and the South Seas in 1846, with\r\nT. H. Huxley as surgeon, resulted in the assembling of scientific\r\ndata in natural history fields which, when classified and developed,\r\nrevolutionized the natural sciences.\r\n\r\nThe work of the _Challenger_, in 1872, and many other memorable British\r\nscientific expeditions augmented and confirmed the data collected in\r\nthe earlier explorations.\r\n\r\nHarvey's explanation of the movement of the blood by the pumping\r\npulsations of the heart quickened interest in biology. Mayer and\r\nHelmholtz, when chemists, had succeeded in artificially making urea\r\nand sugar and investigated living organisms from the viewpoint of\r\nmechanisms operated on the principle of the conservation of energy.\r\nThey traced the manifold functions of the body to chemical and thermal\r\nenergies developed by the destruction of food.\r\n\r\nThese valuable discoveries were augmented by Schleiden and Schwann,\r\nshowing that all organisms are built up of living cells. The offices\r\nperformed within cells by colloids and solutions, and in the nerves by\r\nelectric movements, were traced.\r\n\r\nInvestigations into the most minute forms of animal life also furnished\r\nstartling results. Schwann found, in 1838, that fermenting yeast\r\nconsists of living vegetable cells, and that organic putrefaction\r\nis caused by the activities of such cells. Louis Pasteur (1822-1895)\r\ndemonstrated that the presence of bacteria in any animal is always\r\ndue to the entrance of bacteria and microbes from the outside, or by\r\nmeans favoring the abnormal increase of existing germs. He also showed\r\nby experiments that diseases like chicken cholera, phylloxera, or the\r\nsilkworm disease are caused by particular microbes. These discoveries\r\nled to the tracing of many common diseases to their special living\r\ngerms.\r\n\r\nWhile these impressive additions to scientific knowledge were being\r\nmade, other naturalists were studying the instinctive emotional and\r\nintelligent behavior and psychology of animals, both singly and in\r\nherds. Animals and insects were found to display signs of intelligence,\r\nsometimes of a high order; to live socially, in many cases; and to play\r\nand court with emotional attributes. Throughout the animal kingdom,\r\nuntil man is reached, animals are guided in their activities by self\r\nand racial preservation.\r\n\r\nPlay was found to be a fruitful factor in animal education, even in\r\nminute insects. The behavior of any animal does not stand alone, but\r\nis related to that of others. Animals which hunt, or are hunted,\r\ncombatants, rivals, mates, and enemies, react upon one another.\r\n\r\nEntomology, the science of insects, has been extensively systematized.\r\nPractically every phenomenon relating to the insect metamorphosis has\r\nbeen disclosed. The works of Binet, Lubbock, Fabre, and many others\r\nhave illuminated the psychology of insect life. The charming writings\r\nof J. H. Fabre on the life of a fly, on the mason bees, the hunting\r\nwasps, the life of a caterpillar, of a grasshopper, of the sacred\r\nbeetles and other insects, are as thrilling and instructive as any\r\nmasterpiece of romantic writing. What could be more interesting than\r\nFabre's account of his observations on the glowworm, when he discovered\r\nthat its luminescence is due to oxidation by air forces through a\r\nspecial lightning tube, and that it occurs in males as well as females\r\nand in the eggs and grubs likewise? He shows that the glowworm's\r\nlife, from start to finish, is one carnival of light. The females are\r\nliving lighthouses which brilliantly illumine the wild thyme and other\r\nflowering plants they haunt on dark nights, making miniature fairylands\r\nin country districts.\r\n\r\nStudies in the growth and form of living bodies have opened up many\r\ninteresting problems in physical biology. The cell and tissue, shell\r\nand bone, leaf and flower are various portions of matter, the particles\r\nof which are moved, molded, conformed, or shaped in obedience to\r\nthe laws of physics. Forms like those of the lovely wing scales of\r\nbutterflies, of lace flies, or the spiral shells of the foraminifera\r\nare natural diagrams of the results of physical forces. Biologists not\r\nonly study the nature of the motions of living organisms as animal\r\nkinetics, but also the conformation of the organism itself, whose\r\npermanence or equilibrium is explained by the interaction or balance of\r\nforces leading to static conditions.\r\n\r\nThe dynamics of cell formation and cell division and their karyokinetic\r\nfigure drawings are the result of numerous complex physical force\r\nstruggles brought about by chemical and physiological reactions.\r\nStudies of these have shown that the spermatozoön, nucleus,\r\nchromosomes, or the germ plasms, which develop organic life, can never\r\nact alone. They must be started by other forces which make them seats\r\nof energy.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of George Rainey on the elementary formation of the\r\nskeletons of small animals, of Carpenter upon the formation of shells,\r\nand those of Professor Harting on the same subjects, have shown how\r\nlime solutions acting in conjunction with gelatinous substances, or\r\nmembranes, build up the numerous geometric shapes of the frames of\r\nso many kinds of primitive organisms, and the scales of fish or the\r\nextraordinarily beautiful markings and sculpture of shells.\r\n\r\nThe application of the Cartesian coordinates to the outline of\r\norganisms, skulls, bones, and organs of animals has opened up a new\r\nfield of mathematics--biological research which has yielded many\r\nresults confirming theories based on other data and supplying facts\r\nof great interest that may at any time result in the establishment of\r\nimportant generalizations.\r\n\r\nThe fact of beauty in animate nature is so pronounced, and man's\r\ncontemplative delight in beautiful things is so natural that\r\ninvestigations have been made into the æsthetic emotions of other\r\nanimals. A vast array of facts has been collected which leaves no\r\ndoubt of the universal appreciation of beauty. The lovely colors\r\nof shells, butterflies and birds, the extraordinary beauty of the\r\ndesigns of the frames of the Foraminifera, radiolarians and sponges,\r\nthe graceful logarithmic spirals of horns and flower and leaf buds,\r\nand the charming flowing lines in the shape of the race horse and\r\ngazelle, these elements of organic beauty which emphasize and enhance\r\nthe forms of animals, all contribute to the general embellishment of\r\nnature. The combinations of beauty of form, color, and movements in\r\nparrots, humming birds, the fish inhabiting coral reefs, butterflies,\r\nand orchids, are always perfect. We likewise find that in all parts\r\nof the globe, and in each life zone, organic beauty conforms to that\r\nof the landscape and the heavens. The biological significance of this\r\nuniversality of beauty in the organic world will be dealt with in the\r\nfollowing chapter.\r\n\r\nThe fishes of the seas, rivers, streams, and lakes have been studied,\r\nclassified, and described as completely as the insects of the air, the\r\nfield, the soil, and those parasitic upon other organisms.\r\n\r\nThe surveys of the Atlantic have brought to light many types of\r\nfish which inhabit only the deepest parts of the ocean. These fish\r\nare modified in most extraordinary ways to fit their surroundings.\r\nOwing to the darkness of their living zones, they are provided with\r\nluminescent appendages which are practically similar to the firefly's\r\nand glowworm's electric generators. The lights are formed, as in the\r\ninsects, by the oxidation of material exuded by the fish.\r\n\r\nThere are more than 180 families of fishes recorded. Each family\r\ncontains an average of twenty genera and each genus about five species.\r\nThe known species of fish are, therefore, between 19,000 and 20,000.\r\nThe Danish naturalist Hensen found 278,795,000,000 fecundated fish eggs\r\nper square mile in the summer waters of the Skagerrack. The waters of\r\nthe seas from the Arctic to the Antarctic limits are full of fish eggs\r\nas well as those of shellfish and sea organisms generally. This shows\r\nthat organic life is as abundant in the sea as anywhere on land.\r\n\r\nJust as temperature and salinity are the chief agents of oceanic\r\ncirculation and current movements, so they are the leading factors in\r\npromoting the organic life of the sea.\r\n\r\nThe vast heterogeneous mixtures of living creatures, comprising\r\nvegetable and animal organisms, larvæ, and eggs of fish and animals,\r\nwhich are swept hither and thither by the sea tides are called\r\nplankton. This term means the living dust or emulsion of the sea.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that vegetable plankton is composed of bacteria\r\nand adult microscopic algæ, largely of the Diatomaceæ, Peridinaceæ,\r\nCyanophyceæ, and other primary groups.\r\n\r\nThe animal plankton comprises a mass of microscopic creatures belonging\r\nto the Protozoa, Radiolaria, and Globeriginæ. There are also immense\r\nnumbers of tiny, invisible crustaceans like the Copepoda, and eggs and\r\nspores of all kinds of fish and algæ. These organisms are so dense in\r\ncertain sea areas that their particular colorations are reflected in\r\nthe water. The Red Sea, for example, is colored by a reddish algæ; the\r\nBaltic and ocean areas near Greenland are colored green by swarms of\r\nalgæ, and certain tropical seas are often brilliantly colored in the\r\nsame manner.\r\n\r\nPlankton furnishes fish with nutriment. The study of the movements\r\nof plankton, at seasonal intervals, has led to the discovery of\r\nthe causes, extent, and results of the migration of the principal\r\ncommercial fishes. These researches are so valuable that most large\r\nnations support marine biological stations and ships to regularly\r\nmake observations. The Norwegian naturalist Särs, Sir John Murray,\r\nthe Prince of Monaco, and others have furnished accounts of the life\r\nhistories, feeding grounds, metamorphoses and migrations of many\r\nfishes, and have shown how the inhabitants of the plankton masses\r\nlive upon themselves or produce nitrifying or denitrifying bacteria,\r\nchemicals, and mineral substances like lime, phosphates, and horny\r\nmembranous material.\r\n\r\nThe development of biology and embryology, and the peculiar habits\r\nand color schemes of certain fish, insects, birds, and animals led to\r\ninquiries about design in nature, the causes of the development of\r\nspecies, and the instincts and habits of animals. Erasmus, Darwin,\r\nBuffon, Cuvier, and others began these studies, but it was Charles\r\nDarwin (1809-1882), who by the publication of his \"Origin of Species\"\r\nin 1859, first furnished many of the keys to the riddles of organic\r\nlife. The next chapter will show what has developed from his labors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nORGANIC EVOLUTION, VARIATION, AND HEREDITY\r\n\r\n\r\nScience developed when primitive man began pondering over the problems\r\nof the creation. He sought the causes of life, of the development of\r\nlife forms, and the authorship or origin of the uniformity and apparent\r\ndesign in nature. It is, therefore, probable that what we now study as\r\nthe science of organic evolution is one of the oldest of the sciences.\r\nAs the ages have rolled on, the origin of life has been explained in\r\nturn by theories of: (1) eternity of present conditions; (2) miraculous\r\ncreation; (3) catastrophism with (a) increases by immigration (b)\r\nincreases by successive creations; and, finally, by (4) organic\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\nThe term organic evolution means the forming of new combinations of the\r\nelements of organisms. It does not mean the arising of an animal or\r\nplant out of nothing--a new creation. That idea was exploded long ago.\r\nThe science which Darwin started surveys the whole course of natural\r\nhistory in terms of four dimensions--length, breadth, depth, and\r\nduration. This was the plan which led Darwin to his great discoveries.\r\nWhile studying the minor changes taking place in common animals and\r\nplants, and looking over the broad vistas of nature back to the\r\nremotest times, he saw how each year countless weak and ill-adapted\r\nplants, insects, and animals were killed off. When he reflected that\r\nthis process has been going on throughout all time, the idea flashed\r\ninto his mind that it is through this testing ordeal that adaptability\r\nof surviving organisms is derived.\r\n\r\nOne of the grandest conceptions of the human mind is that the\r\napparently complex, inharmonic system of nature has developed from a\r\nsimple beginning on a cooled globe from a jellylike cell.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the permanence of species was generally held by\r\nbiologists before publication of Darwin's first great book. Darwin said\r\nthat no naturalist of his time doubted the accuracy of the theory of\r\nthe eternity of existing conditions and they refused to listen to his\r\nviews regarding the mutability of species.\r\n\r\nDarwin put forth the theory of organic evolution by natural selection\r\nand the survival of the fittest. The great beauty of this theory\r\nlies in its simplicity and its appeal to agencies which we can see\r\nin full operation every day and night. The skillful manner in which\r\nDarwin marshaled data to substantiate his theory quickly converted\r\nthe scientific world, and led to revolutionary changes in the general\r\ntendencies of knowledge, and in practically all fields of human\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nDarwin's terse statement of his conception was: \"As many more\r\nindividuals of each species are born than can possibly survive, and as\r\nconsequently there is a frequently recurring struggle for existence, it\r\nfollows that any being, if it vary in any manner profitable to itself,\r\nunder the complex and sometimes varying conditions of life, will have\r\na better chance of surviving, and thus be naturally selected. From the\r\nstrong principle of inheritance any selected variety will tend to\r\npropagate its new and modified form.\" (\"Origin of Species,\" Intro.)\r\n\r\nThis statement of the doctrine of the survival of the fittest,\r\nsuggesting a glimpse at the great pageant of nature from the remotest\r\ntimes, shows how the organisms existing at this moment are the\r\ndescendants of the victors in the world's greatest battles. The\r\nstruggles for life, always keen and persistent, shared in by every\r\nindividual organism, both animal and vegetable, are the instigators\r\nof all progress in the natural world. They are nature's means for the\r\nattainment of beauty, usefulness, and perfection.\r\n\r\nThe Darwinian theory was based upon the observed facts that members\r\nof any given species are not alike, while their offspring may differ\r\nin numerous ways from their parents. The data furnished by zoölogy,\r\nbotany, physiology, and other sciences supply overwhelming evidence\r\nthat the present species of animals and plants have arisen through the\r\nmodification from various causes of many pre-existing species. The\r\norganisms with which we are familiar owe their characteristics to the\r\naccumulation of a long series of changes similar to those that we may\r\nsee that they are still undergoing.\r\n\r\nThe methods pursued in studying variation in species, and its\r\nimportant accompaniment, heredity, consists in comparison, statistical\r\nexaminations, cultural experiments, and crossbreeding.\r\n\r\nEvolution is the process of differentiation accompanying the operations\r\nof nature. All the great naturalists before Darwin's time noted\r\nfacts indicating this universal differentiation, but it required the\r\nparticularly wide sweep of Darwin's mind to phrase and demonstrate it.\r\n\r\nThe law of origin by evolution, as Herbert Spencer showed, is not\r\nconfined to the method of bringing into existence new species of\r\nanimals and plants. The stars, planets, the geological strata and earth\r\ncontours and forms, human institutions, social customs, and practically\r\neverything in nature are obedient to it.\r\n\r\nMuch research work in evolution has been done since Darwin stated his\r\ntheory, but the basic principle of the survival of the fittest remains\r\nuntouched by criticism. Some of his views respecting minor details of\r\nselection and the effects of various factors have been modified or\r\nenlarged, and many new evolutionary forces have been discovered. It has\r\nalso been found that a single cause is usually followed by more than\r\none effect.\r\n\r\nWeissmann has drawn attention to the importance of adaptations. Most\r\norganic beings are usually closely fitted for the conditions under\r\nwhich their lives are spent.\r\n\r\nThe principal parts of every animal and plant, and all the points in\r\nwhich one species differs from a nearly related species, have been\r\nshown to have arisen on account of their usefulness to the creatures\r\npossessing them. As natural selection is always progressive, it follows\r\nthat no adaptation is ever perfect. There is always progress from the\r\nuseful to the more useful--a continual striving for greater beauty of\r\nform and color and higher efficiency.\r\n\r\nWorks on evolution furnish an abundance of interesting evidence showing\r\nhow adaptation works. A single instance may be cited here.\r\n\r\nOne of the Mexican yucca plants common in our Southern States is\r\npollinated by a moth of the Pronuba family. This moth is adapted for\r\nits work by several special organs including a special ovipositor\r\nand peculiar maxillary tentacles which are not found in other moths.\r\nThe female moth collects pollen with these tentacles from several\r\nyucca flowers, rolls it into a ball and kneads it into a pellet.\r\nWhen the pellet is ready the moth seeks an unvisited flower and,\r\nafter depositing a few of her own eggs in the ovary, she climbs the\r\nstyle and forces the pollen pellet into the stigma. This is the way\r\nthe yucca is pollinated and fertilized. Two important purposes are\r\nserved by this arrangement: a species of plant and a species of moth,\r\ntogether with those dependent upon them, are enabled to survive by this\r\nmoth's activities. There are many known cases of similar cooperative\r\nadaptation to living conditions.\r\n\r\nQuetelet, in 1845, followed by Francis Goltin and Karl Pearson, have\r\napplied statistical methods in dealing with evolutionary problems,\r\nand a new science called biometry has been developed. This science\r\nhas yielded much important data regarding the effects of inherited\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\nThe studies of variations in plants by mutations, made by the Dutch\r\nbotanist De Vries, have opened up wide fields of study regarding\r\nthe causes of variation. He has shown that increased bulk or better\r\ncoloration may result from improved nutrition and more light, and that\r\nsuch improved characteristics may be inherited.\r\n\r\nA law of ancestral heredity has been worked out for men by\r\nbiometricians, and this has been confirmed by the experiments of\r\nProfessor Johannsen, of Copenhagen, on self-fertilizing beans, and by\r\nJennings on protozoa. This hypothesis suggests that every ancestor\r\nof a particular man or woman contributes its quota to the heritable\r\nqualities displayed by that individual. The average amount of\r\nresemblance between an individual and any of his particular ancestors\r\nis capable of being numerically expressed.\r\n\r\nThe experiments and conclusions of Gregor Mendel (1822-1882) tend\r\nto oppose the law of ancestral heredity, but it is believed that\r\nany exceptional cases may be explained by the operation of special\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nKarl Pearson has shown by the analyses of numerous statistical records\r\nof Englishmen that by artificial selection any selected characteristic,\r\nsuch as facial contour or stature, can be changed within a few\r\ngenerations. But when the character has been changed about 90 per\r\ncent within a short time another method must be employed, because the\r\noriginal one then becomes less efficient.\r\n\r\nIndividuals in any given population who differ in size from the mean\r\nof the population give rise to offspring which differs from that mean\r\nvalue in the same direction but to a smaller extent. The same law\r\napplies to the color of the hair or to intelligence or constitution.\r\nSelection will always produce a change in the average character of a\r\npopulation taken as a whole. But selection within a pure line, or one\r\nwhich shows only normal variability about a mean or type value, does\r\nnot produce marked changes.\r\n\r\nThe usual selection within any particular population consists in the\r\npartial separation of extreme types.\r\n\r\nThe personal characteristics of any ancestor do not influence his\r\ndescendants. Only the typical characteristics are handed down.\r\n\r\nThese and many other facts developed by investigations in biometry\r\nshould be of value in regulating immigration, so as to guard against\r\ndegenerative influences, and they have greatly increased the efficiency\r\nof farming by showing how to improve farm stocks and crops so as to\r\nyield larger returns. Farmers have been more ready than politicians to\r\navail of their advantages. We note how the speed of racing and trotting\r\nhorses, and the milking capacity of cows, have been improved by the\r\npast century, but we are doing little to reform national health and\r\nefficiency.\r\n\r\nMutation is the name given to the process of origination of a new\r\nspecies or character accomplished by a single step or by a series of\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\nBateson, in 1894, showed that symmetry is a characteristic common\r\nto all organisms. This may affect the whole or parts of an organ.\r\nMajor symmetry involves the whole organism and minor symmetry only\r\nan organ or part. There are meristic variations, involving the\r\nsymmetrical pattern, and substantive variations involving changes in\r\nthe constitution or substance of the organism. Red-flowering plants,\r\nfor example, may yield offspring bearing white flowers. Substantive\r\nvariations are often discontinuous, or accidental, and are infrequent.\r\n\r\nOrganic bodies are built up of a number of cells. The living material\r\nof cells is protoplasm formed out of many elements, of which carbon,\r\noxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, and sulphur are the more important. New\r\ncells arise from bipartition of existing cells. Therefore by following\r\nback the history of any animal or plant we will arrive at a stage\r\nwhen its ancestors had only one cell. Every animal or plant which is\r\npropagated sexually actually starts as a cell and develops through its\r\nmain evolutionary changes in the embryonic state. Cells are liable to\r\nall the evolutionary changes that the organism as a whole is subject to.\r\n\r\nStudies of embryology have shown that the fusion of biparental\r\nreproductive cells results in the formation of a complete new\r\nindividual which, at the time of the fusing of the two conjugating\r\ncells, called gametes, or germ cells, inherits the characteristics of\r\neach parent and its ancestors.\r\n\r\nThe determination of the sex of the cell, plant, or animal, depends\r\nupon the presence of extra male or female sex-chromosomes, or\r\nsex-determinant fibers of the cell nucleus. Certain animals and plants\r\ntransmit male characteristics to the female descendants, while the\r\nfemale transmits her characteristics to the male descendants. There are\r\nmany variations of this kind. These strange movements in heredity are\r\nexplained by the laws governing chromosomes and idio-chromosomes and\r\nelementary cells.\r\n\r\nAccording to the germ plasm theory of inheritance, the separate parts\r\nof living organisms are assumed to be represented by separate material\r\nparticles in the germ cells. In the Mendelian theory each cell is\r\nassumed to contain a large number of _ids_, or complete sets of sex\r\ndeterminants, half the total being derived from each parent. This\r\npermits the germ cells to contain a certain number of ids from each\r\nparent.\r\n\r\nStudies of these subjects show that the great harmonies of the natural\r\nworld are manifested in form, number, pattern, and color, which we find\r\nto be basically simple and, when studied systematically, they appear\r\nquite clearly, so as to be capable of being described and expressed as\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nThe study of the agencies under social control which may improve, or\r\nimpair, the racial qualities of future generations, either physically,\r\nsocially, or mentally, is called the science of eugenics. This new\r\nscience is another outgrowth of the revolution in intellectual\r\ndevelopment originating with the publication of Darwin's theory. Sir\r\nFrancis Galton was the pioneer worker, and he has been followed by\r\nPearson, Yule, Lombroso (1836-1909), and others.\r\n\r\nEugenic studies, confirmed by those of genetics and biometry, show\r\nthat the human race, which is the masterpiece of Nature's evolutionary\r\nprocesses, is capable of much further development through the careful\r\nguiding of the very forces used in evolving man to his present state.\r\nMan can be improved by selection and education to greater beauty,\r\nclearer intellect, larger stature, sounder character, and better\r\nphysique. The measure of what man has done is a good criterion of what\r\nhe is capable of doing under the guidance and encouragement of science.\r\n\r\nGenetics, the study of the hereditary phenomena of organisms, is\r\nbased upon the law of inheritance discovered by Mendel in 1865. This\r\nlaw relates to the inheritance of certain definite characters called\r\nallelomorphs. These characters are found to group themselves in pairs\r\nwhich exhibit more or less antagonistic qualities. A knowledge of\r\nthese characteristics is necessary to conduct selective breeding\r\nexperiments scientifically. It is found that when two similar germ\r\ncells, each bearing the same new combination of allelomorphs, meet\r\nin fertilization, they result in the development of a new zygotic\r\ncombination of a pure type which breeds true. This accounts for the\r\nestablishment of new species. When, on the other hand, the coupling\r\nis unequal, or only partial, there will be irregularities in the\r\ncharacters of the offspring and no new species is likely to develop.\r\nImmense value is attached to this law by naturalists working in all\r\nfields. The three new sciences of eugenics, genetics, and biometry have\r\nprepared the way for a regeneration of humanity through breeding in the\r\ndesirable and breeding out the undesirable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL AND BOTANICAL THEORIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe World War served to demonstrate the degree of perfection which\r\nhas been attained in chemistry. The wonderful high explosives used,\r\nthe poisonous gases, the lubricating and motor oils and a multitude\r\nof valuable chemicals employed for military and naval purposes, many\r\nof which were developed at short notice, showed the modern chemist's\r\ncommand of his science. Yet chemistry is a new science. Practically\r\nit began with Robert Boyle, in England, in 1661. Boyle conducted\r\nexperiments on the rarefaction of air and the nature of gases, and in\r\nhis book, \"The Sceptical Chemist,\" he made this remarkable statement:\r\n\"I am apt to think that men will never be able to explain the phenomena\r\nof nature, while they endeavor to deduce them only from the presence\r\nand proportions of such or such ingredients, and consider such\r\ningredients or elements as bodies in a state of rest; whereas, indeed,\r\nthe greatest part of the affections of matter, and consequently of the\r\nphenomena of nature, seem to depend upon the motion and contrivance of\r\nthe small parts of bodies.\"\r\n\r\nThus Boyle anticipated the chemical theories of matter developed in the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nLavoisier, about 1777, advancing from the quantitative study of one\r\nchemical change to another was able to describe many processes, and\r\nto distinguish between an element and a compound. He cast aside all\r\nthe alchemical formulæ and expressed the results of his experiments in\r\nfractions and proportions.\r\n\r\nJ. B. Richter between 1791 and 1802 made a series of experiments by\r\nwhich he secured the weights of various bases neutralized by constant\r\nweights of several acids, and the weights of several acids neutralized\r\nby constant weights of several bases. He found that the composition of\r\nchemical compounds is constant, as had been assumed by Lavoisier and\r\nBoyle.\r\n\r\nDalton described the atomic constitution of gases in 1808, and sketched\r\nthe law of multiple proportions in chemical combinations and described\r\nbinary, ternary and quaternary combinations.\r\n\r\nPrussic acid was investigated by Gay-Lussac in 1815, when he isolated\r\ncyanogen and found that although it is a compound it plays the part\r\nof an element with hydrogen and the metals. Berzelius also found that\r\nammonium possessed all the properties of an alkali metal.\r\n\r\nTen years after the above discoveries were made, Faraday prepared a\r\ncompound of carbon and hydrogen from liquefied coal gas which led to\r\nthe general study of isomerism and the great discoveries of the organic\r\nradicals with their important combinations.\r\n\r\nWhen isomeric combinations were studied by Jacob Berzelius (1779-1848),\r\nhe was led to devise a means of expressing organic reactions. He wrote\r\nto Wöhler and Liebig a letter outlining his new method in which he\r\nsaid: \"From the moment when one has learned to recognize with certainty\r\nthe existence of ternary atoms of the first order which enter compounds\r\nafter the manner of simple substances, it will be a great relief in\r\nthe expression of the language of formulæ to denote each radical by its\r\nown symbol, whereby the idea of composition it is desired to express\r\nwill be placed clearly before the eye of the reader.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                            Photo, Fifth Avenue Hospital\r\n\r\nROOM IN WHICH INFECTED ARTICLES ARE STERILIZED]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MODERN OPERATING ROOM IN A PARIS HOSPITAL. IT IS FITTED\r\nWITH A GLASS DOME AND RADIO MICROPHONES FOR THE USE OF STUDENTS AND\r\nDOCTORS WHO WISH TO WATCH THE OPERATIONS AND HEAR DISTINCTLY THE\r\nCOMMENTS OF THE SURGEONS]\r\n\r\nAn example of this method of expressing reactions was given in the case\r\nof the action of chlorine on benzoic acid. He wrote B₂O for benzoic\r\nacid, B₂CL₂ for chlorbenzol and B₂ + NH₂ for benzamide. With certain\r\nsimple improvements made subsequently by Gmelin, the method devised by\r\nBerzelius was generally adopted and is in use to-day.\r\n\r\nThe numerous investigations now being made with the object of\r\ndiscovering the various combinations of the elements led to many\r\nimprovements in chemical analyses. When we read Berzelius' accounts of\r\nhis analyses they seem to have been written only yesterday. He and his\r\ncontemporaries developed analytical and synthetic methods to almost the\r\nefficiency that we see to-day.\r\n\r\nWe also owe to Berzelius a table of the elements showing their\r\nelectrical qualities, an electrochemical theory, identifying chemical\r\naffinity with electric attraction, and a new nomenclature, besides a\r\nvast amount of descriptive chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the specific heats of various solid elements by\r\nDulong and Petit in 1819, and Mitscherlich's finding of the isomorphic\r\nphenomena in 1818, resulted in the publication of a new atomic weight\r\ntable in 1826 by Berzelius.\r\n\r\nThe experiments made in isomorphism by Mitscherlich led him to discover\r\ndimorphism and study crystallography. He used his knowledge of crystal\r\nmeasurement extensively and developed synthetic chemistry and the laws\r\nof crystallization.\r\n\r\nThompson, Prout, and Wollaston were working on problems in England\r\nsimilar to those examined in Sweden by Berzelius and Mitscherlich.\r\n\r\nMolecules were discriminated from atoms in 1826 by Jean Baptiste Dumas\r\nand Faraday discovered his law of electrochemical action in 1834.\r\n\r\nOrganic chemistry originated in Manchester, England, when Dalton\r\nread his paper before the Manchester Philosophic Society in 1803 on\r\nthe theory of atomic weights. This paper led Gay-Lussac, Thenard,\r\nBerthollet, de Saussure and others to study organic analyses as devised\r\nby Dalton. Gay-Lussac and Thenard greatly improved Dalton's methods\r\nand in 1824, as shown by Chevreul's work on fats and greases, organic\r\nanalyses had been brought to high perfection.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of substitution in hydrocarbon compounds like the\r\npetroleum oils were studied by Laurent who proposed a theory of basic\r\nnuclei. C₁₀H₈ being the nucleus of the naphthalene group and C₂H₄ that\r\nof the ethylene group, derived nuclei can be obtained from these by\r\nsubstitution and hydrogen and other elements acting on derived nuclei\r\nfrom numerous hydrocarbon series.\r\n\r\nThe homology of the hydrocarbons was discovered by Gerhardt in 1844\r\nwhile he was investigating the alcohols. Wurtz's work on the ammonia\r\ncompounds, Williamson's on the ethers, Hoffmann's on anilines, Graham's\r\nand Liebig's on the citrates, and Frankland's, Kolbe's and Kekulé's\r\nwork on other compounds raised organic chemistry to such a high plane\r\nthat industrial chemists were able to use their theoretical conclusions\r\nand build a great number of important industries upon organic\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nLothar Meyer, in 1868, and Mendeléeff, in 1869, published atomic\r\nweights showing improvements in the theories of valency and the\r\ninterrelationship of atomic weights. Mendeléeff was able to predict\r\nfrom the vacant positions in his table the discovery of important new\r\nelements. A number of these elements have since been discovered.\r\n\r\nThe aniline dye industries have grown out of the discoveries of many\r\nchemists. The basic work was done by Faraday, Laurent, and Runge, who\r\nisolated valuable hydrocarbons from coal gas tar. Hoffmann discovered\r\naniline and Perkin obtained mauve in 1856 by the oxidation of aniline\r\nwith chromic acid. It was this and subsequent discoveries by Perkin\r\nwhich gave the greatest impetus to synthetic dyes. The solubility of\r\na dye was improved by increasing its acidity (sulphonation) or by\r\nincreasing its alkalinity (alkylation). Similar dyes are now made by\r\nthe same methods from many common aromatic substances.\r\n\r\nThe chemistry of explosives was developed by Van Helmont, Debus,\r\nBunsen, Abel, Nobel, and, others. Fulminates were used for detonators\r\nby Ure in 1831, picrates were employed as explosives by Fontaine and\r\nAbel; nitrocellulose (guncotton) discovered by Braconnot in 1832 and\r\nused as an explosive by Schönbein in 1846, and nitroglycerine was\r\nproduced by Sobrero in 1847. Smokeless powders made from guncotton,\r\ndynamite, and gelatine were introduced by Nobel in 1890.\r\n\r\nPasteur showed, in 1848, that when the double sodium ammonium racemate\r\nwas crystallized, two kinds of crystals separated from the solution.\r\nWhen one set of crystals was dissolved in water the solution rotated\r\na beam of polarized light to the left, while the aqueous solution\r\nof the other crystals rotated the light to the right. These crystals\r\nthus revealed their geometrical properties with perfect light while in\r\nsolution in water. Pasteur noted that optical activity of this kind is\r\nthe expression of some form of molecular asymmetry.\r\n\r\nLe Bel in 1874 also pointed out that optical activity is an expression\r\nof the asymmetry of the chemical molecule and showed that all carbon\r\ncompounds which are optically active contain a carbon atom combined\r\nwith four different atoms, or groups. Van't Hoff showed in 1875 that\r\nthere were definite relations between the arrangements of tetrahedral\r\ncarbon atoms and polarization phenomena and established the theory of\r\nsuch atoms.\r\n\r\nWillard Gibbs, of Yale, discovered what is known as the phase rule,\r\nwhich shows, by thermodynamic methods, how the conditions of chemical\r\nequilibria can be systematically grouped.\r\n\r\nVan't Hoff, Pfeffer, and others noticed that when two solutions are\r\nbrought together, if one is more concentrated than the other, diffusion\r\nbegins in the concentrated and extends to the weaker solution. This\r\nshows a talent force in concentrated solutions which is now known as\r\nosmotic pressure. Van't Hoff and Arrhenius showed that for comparable\r\nconcentrations the osmotic pressure of a solution is exactly equal to\r\nthe pressure of a gas. These discoveries led to a brilliant series of\r\ninvestigations into electrolytic chemistry.\r\n\r\nThe theory of electrolytic dissociation advanced by Ostwald shows that\r\nthe molecules of electrolytes in aqueous solutions are broken down into\r\nelectrically charged parts called ions. In very dilute solutions the\r\ndissociation of strong acids, bases, and salts is practically complete\r\nas was suggested by Williamson in 1851.\r\n\r\nCatalysis, or reaction brought about by agents which do not enter into\r\nthe chemical changes, was discovered by Berzelius. Ostwald investigated\r\nand developed catalytic reactions which are now extensively employed\r\nin industry, particularly in refining oils and in the fixation of\r\nnitrogen. Hot platinum, for example, is used to act catalytically in\r\ncausing sulphur dioxide and oxygen to combine and form the basis of\r\nsulphuric acid, sulphur trioxide.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important applications of catalysis to industry is the\r\nHaber process for securing nitrogen from the air. When air and hydrogen\r\nare compressed and heated to a high temperature in the presence of a\r\ncatalyzer such as metallic uranium or iron carbide, the nitrogen and\r\nhydrogen combine and form ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Sir William Crookes on vacuum tubes subjected to\r\nelectrical impulses led the way to the discovery of radioactivity, and\r\ninvestigations of radium have revolutionized our conceptions of the\r\nnature and properties of matter.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of helium, argon, the niton emanation from radium and\r\nother elements by Ramsay, Collie, Soddy, and others will be referred to\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nCarl Linnæus, who is called the father of modern botany, established\r\nthe genera and species of plants upon philosophical principles. He\r\nestablished a binomial nomenclature and formulated modern descriptive\r\nmethods. Thus he prepared the way for the systematic works of De\r\nJussieu and De Candolle.\r\n\r\nDe Candolle, in 1819, published a new method of classification based\r\nupon morphological characters. He defined and illustrated the\r\ndoctrine of the symmetry of plant organs and asserted that a natural\r\nclassification must be based on a plan of symmetry.\r\n\r\nThe relationships between the endosperm and embryo were shown in 1810\r\nby Robert Brown in his monograph on the Australian Proteaceæ. The\r\nmorphological nature of seed reserves was described by him. He also\r\ndiscovered the functions of the cell nucleus and founded cytology.\r\nHe showed that the oscillation of minute particles in the fluids of\r\nplants when viewed under high microscopic powers, known as the Brownian\r\nmovement, is due to purely physical causes.\r\n\r\nSchultze, Unger, and others, working on suggestions previously made by\r\nKnight, Robert Brown, and Hooke, discovered the rôle of protoplasm in\r\nplant cells. Alexander Braun and De Bary correlated the movements of\r\nprotoplasm with the locomotory movements of free zoögonidia and the\r\namœboid movements of Mycetozoa. These investigations directed research\r\nto further studies of the structure and constitution of protoplasm and\r\nhelped develop the cellular theory.\r\n\r\nThe Algæ were studied and classified by Naegeli, Unger, Von Mohl,\r\nHaustein, and others in 1847-1850.\r\n\r\nThe vascular cryptogams were studied by Hofmeister. He found that the\r\nalternation of a sexual with an asexual generation is common to all\r\nplants of the mosses, vascular cryptogams, and gymnosperms, as well as\r\namong angiosperms.\r\n\r\nHofmeister's work led to appreciation of the fact that a natural system\r\nof plant classification must be based, not on balancing the values of\r\nthe morphological parts of fruits and flowers, but on the anatomy of\r\nthe real and concealed reproductive organs.\r\n\r\nFossil botany, or paleophytology, was founded, in 1828, by Adolphe\r\nBrongniart. Witham, Goeppert, Unger, Corda, and others helped to\r\nadvance this science.\r\n\r\nThe publication of Darwin's \"Origin of Species\" in 1859 found the\r\nvarious botanical sciences already well worked out by numerous\r\ncapable experts. A huge amount of data and descriptive matter had\r\nbeen assembled and botany, like the other sciences, was ready to be\r\nquickened by the Darwinian theories.\r\n\r\nThe idea of a progressive evolution in plants had been suspected by\r\nmany botanists, but the genius of Darwin developed it. Living plants\r\nwere pictured as a multitude of units competing for food, light, air,\r\nand room for growth, and struggling against unfavorable environments.\r\nThe classification of tissues was begun, and the phenomena of\r\nabsorption of water and salts, the ascent of sap, the absorption of\r\nminerals and nitrogen, and metabolism and growth were elucidated.\r\nInvestigations were made into the nature and functions of chlorophyll\r\nand other plant substances. These studies resulted in suggesting means\r\nfor improving crops by artificial selection, as shown in the work of\r\nLuther Burbank.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nGEOLOGY, METALLURGY, AND METEOROLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\nGeology is essentially a nineteenth century product. Fossils, minerals,\r\nrocks, and rock strata had attracted more or less attention from the\r\nearliest times. The Egyptians, Greeks, and Romans had books dealing\r\nwith such subjects, and Greek philosophers, like Aristotle, lectured\r\nupon them. But it was only in the last century that geology was placed\r\nupon a scientific basis and began to make progress. The reformation\r\nwas begun by Cuvier's work on paleontology, the chemical and physical\r\ndiscoveries of the eighteenth century, and the works of Hooke, Boyle,\r\nBuffon, Linnæus, and others. The special technique required in\r\ngeographical research could not be developed until the biological,\r\nanatomical, botanical, and physical sciences had been established on a\r\nscientific plane. That is why geology remained for so many centuries\r\nundeveloped, and then rapidly advanced during the nineteenth century.\r\nIts preparation was long and involved, while its fruition was rapid and\r\nbrilliant.\r\n\r\nWilliam Smith (1769-1839), called the father of English geology, was\r\na mining surveyor engaged in making colliery and farm surveys in\r\nOxfordshire and the west of England. His professional work led him\r\nto study the coal outcrops, and in 1793 he mapped the inclined coal\r\ndeposits in Somersetshire. The numerous rock strata accompanying\r\nthe coal beds contained fossils which he found could be used to\r\nidentify the beds in that field with others in northern counties.\r\nHe published an account of this manner of using type fossils for\r\nidentifying fossiliferous rock formations in 1799, and in 1815 issued\r\nhis geological map of England, Wales, and southern Scotland. This map\r\nshowed the advantages that scientific geology and mineralogy offered\r\nto industry and caused scientists all over Europe to study geological\r\nphenomena and make sketch maps of local geology.\r\n\r\nA work on paleontology, dealing with the fossils of the Old Red\r\nSandstone deposits, published in England by Hugh Miller (1802-1856),\r\nwhich had an enormous popularity and has been described as the most\r\nfascinating book ever written on a geological subject, followed Smith's\r\n\"Strata Identified by Organized Fossils.\" A large amount of mapping\r\nresulted from the issuing of these two works. These maps called for\r\ndetailed descriptions, and these in turn resulted in the accumulation\r\nof many interesting data which, when collected, and systematized, led\r\nto many important discoveries.\r\n\r\nWhile these authors were preparing their books, Werner, De Luc,\r\nDe Saussure, Lamarck, and others were working out paleontological\r\nproblems, Romé de l'Isle, Brongniart, Haüy, d'Aubuisson, and others\r\nwere building up the science of mineralogy.\r\n\r\n\"The Theory of the Earth,\" of Dr. James Hutton (1726-1797), was\r\npublished in 1785, and in an enlarged form in 1795. This book described\r\nthe metamorphoses of sand into sandstones, quartzites, schists, and\r\nother rock formations; the work of floods and lava floods; the\r\nsculpturing powers of streams, rains, and winds, etc. He indicated the\r\neffects of the alternate sinking and raising of strata through earth\r\nshrinkings and volcanic phenomena, and taught that purely physical\r\ncauses can be found for every geological effect.\r\n\r\nPlayfair's \"Illustrations of the Huttonian Theory of the Earth\"\r\naugmented the teachings of Hutton's book, while works by Jameson,\r\nKirwan, Boué, Sir James Hall, Daubrée, St. Claire-Deville, Buckland,\r\nSedgwick, Bakewell, Breislak, Maclure, and others rapidly appeared\r\nsustaining the Huttonian, or the Wernerean theories of geological\r\ndeposition.\r\n\r\nThe work of James Sowerby (1757-1822), entitled \"The Mineral\r\nConchology of Great Britain\" and that of James de Carle Sowerby\r\n(1781-1871), published between 1812 and 1845, marked the establishment\r\nof paleontology as a science. Both father and son were well-trained\r\nnaturalists and artists, and, like William Smith, reproduced the\r\nfossils and their containing rocks to scale and in natural colors.\r\nThese works greatly simplified the labors of field geologists in\r\nidentifying rock strata and type fossils.\r\n\r\nIn Germany geology was worked out by Baron von Schlotheim (1764-1882),\r\nGoldfuss (1782-1848), and Count Munster (1776-1844). Brocchi\r\n(1772-1826) described Italian fossil strata.\r\n\r\nThe \"Geological Classification of Rocks,\" of MacCulloch, marked\r\nthe separation of petrology as a science from descriptive geology.\r\nMacCulloch noted that the ancient granites and granite schists are\r\namong the oldest rock forms.\r\n\r\nVon Humboldt, Murchison, Lyell, De la Beche, Von Buch, Elie de\r\nBeaumont, Holley, Geikie, Bonney, Wollaston, Scrope and Daubeny\r\nwere among the pioneer geologists in Europe, while James Dwight Dana\r\n(1818-1895), E. S. Dana, Conrad, Hitchcock, Warren, Lesley, Fremont,\r\nand others published descriptive geological accounts in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nReferences to the geology and minerals of New Mexico were made in\r\nHumboldt's \"New Spain.\" Greenhow's work on Oregon and California,\r\npublished in 1845, and Lewis and Clark's reports added much to our\r\nknowledge of American topography and geology. These reports were\r\nfollowed by those of Stanton, Clarence King, Hague, Emmons, Custer,\r\nPowell, Davis, Gilbert, Agassiz, and others which dealt with various\r\nphases of American geology, paleontology, glaciation, and mineralogy,\r\nand prepared the way for the publication of the valuable works of Dana,\r\nWilliams, Iddings, Washington, Pirsson, Clarke, Grabau, Brush, and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of geological problems from the viewpoint of present\r\ncauses was begun after the publication of Lyell's \"Principles of\r\nGeology\" (1830-1833). Earlier geologists were aware of the fact that\r\nmany of the rock formations had been derived from other consolidation\r\nof sand and mud beds and by other actions which may be studied in\r\noperation to-day. But the systematic manner in which Lyell treated the\r\nwhole field of geology made such an impression upon geologists that the\r\npublication of his great work marked a new era in the science. De la\r\nBeche, Buckland, Geikie, Bonney, and other geologists in England; Dana,\r\nand a number of scientists in the United States Geological Survey, in\r\nAmerica; Vogt and Naumann, in Germany; Studer in Switzerland; Stopanni,\r\nin Italy, and many specialists in other countries took up the work of\r\nLyell, and at present practically every important geological factor is\r\nknown and the effects of its operations have been described.\r\n\r\nThe succession of life in geological periods is studied under\r\npaleontology. This science developed at the same time as systematic\r\nand descriptive geology. Many great naturalists have contributed to\r\nit. Agassiz, Hall, Dawson, Walcott, Marsh, and others in the United\r\nStates and Canada; Owen, Prestwich, and others in England; and numerous\r\nwriters in Europe have published valuable monographs on various phases\r\nof fossil and strata-graphical geology.\r\n\r\nPaleontology, by fixing the succession of animal and vegetable eras,\r\nhas served as a basis for measuring time, revealing the antiquity\r\nof man and of the principal mammals, as well as showing changes in\r\nclimate, and in land and sea areas.\r\n\r\nThe application of geology to many industries called forth another\r\nbranch of the science known as economic geology. This deals with\r\nthe origin and geographical distribution of the useful minerals,\r\nthe derivation of underground waters and petroleum, and the changes\r\nundergone by soils.\r\n\r\nThe first important impetus to economic geology was given by the\r\npublication of Whitney's \"Metallic Wealth of the United States\" in\r\n1854, Von Cotta's work on ore deposits in 1859, and the economic\r\nreferences in the textbooks of the leading European and American\r\ngeologists. The recent work of Bonney, Groddeck, De Launay, Phillips,\r\nProsepny, Van Hise, Emmons, Le Conte, Lindgren, and others has greatly\r\nadvanced the interest and usefulness of the science.\r\n\r\nThese writers carried out an extended series of investigations on the\r\ndepth temperature and physical and chemical condition of the earth's\r\ncrust. Chemical analyses of rocks and soils were made and the changes\r\nwrought by physical and chemical forces were noted. On these were\r\nbased theories as to the formation of rocks, soils, minerals, and ore\r\ndeposits. The erosive properties of soil water were found to be limited\r\nto a depth not exceeding 20,000 feet, although hydrostatic water bodies\r\nare rarely found as low as half that distance, the rise in temperature\r\nprecluding their existence. The work of these men revealed the part\r\nplayed by vulcanism in rock changes, and the effects produced through\r\nhot solutions and magmatic intrusions.\r\n\r\nVarious systems of classification of minerals and ore deposits were\r\ndeveloped. Richard Beck's, \"The Nature of Ore Deposits\" (1900), and\r\nLindgren's \"Mineral Deposits\" (1919), are works which have contributed\r\nto the systematizing of economic geology from the mineral standpoint,\r\nand the establishment of epochs of metal generation.\r\n\r\nThe ore deposits of the United States have been described in the\r\nmonographs of the United States Geological Survey, and by Kemp, Spurr,\r\nGrabau and other writers.\r\n\r\nThis branch of geology emphasizes the strong tendency to concentration\r\nshown by mineral elements. All climatic forces are found to aid this\r\nwork. Underground waters, both flowing and stationary, are powerful\r\nassistants.\r\n\r\nOther phases of economic geology have been developed in studies of\r\nsubterranean waters, microscopical petrology and mineralogy, the\r\nchemical analyses of rocks, etc. Among the leaders in this work have\r\nbeen Pirsson, Emmons, Iddings, Washington, Van Hise, Clarke, and others.\r\n\r\nThe enormous metallurgical industries of to-day are all dependent upon\r\nscientific principles chiefly discovered and applied in the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nMetallurgists in the previous century knew that by adding certain\r\nmetals to molten steel it could be hardened. A method of this kind was\r\npublished by Réaumur in 1722. Tool points, he showed, could be hardened\r\nif the steel when red hot was forced into solid tin, lead, copper,\r\nsilver or gold, thus producing an alloy stronger and harder than the\r\npure steel.\r\n\r\nA series of calorimetric researches on metallic alloys, carried on by\r\nBergman, led to the discovery that steel differs from iron merely in\r\nthe carbon contents. Clouet, in 1798, followed this by an experiment in\r\nwhich he melted up a little crucible iron with a diamond and obtained\r\na mass of steel. This created a sensation and led to many other\r\nexperiments on the metallurgy of cast and wrought iron and steel.\r\n\r\nThomas Young, in 1802-7, studied the mechanical properties of iron and\r\nsteel and developed the theory of the modulus of elasticity. A patent\r\nwas issued to the Rev. Robert Stirling, in 1817, for a regenerative\r\niron smelting furnace. The next year Samuel Baldwin Rogers substituted\r\niron bottoms for sand bottoms in puddling furnaces. Faraday and Stodart\r\nproduced the first alloy of nickel and steel in 1820, and in 1822\r\nFaraday showed that there is a fundamental chemical difference between\r\nhard and soft steel.\r\n\r\nThe first patent for a hot blast for iron furnaces was granted to James\r\nBeaumont Neilson in 1828. All these discoveries led to important\r\nimprovements in iron making.\r\n\r\nThe steam hammer was patented by Nasmyth in 1842, and between 1843 and\r\n1848 Thomas Andrews conducted valuable investigations into the heat of\r\ncombination.\r\n\r\nThe ground was now prepared for one of the greatest of metallurgical\r\ninventions--the conversion of pig iron into steel by an air blast in a\r\nBessemer converter. This invention not only vastly extended the use of\r\nsteel, but drew attention to the valuable oxidizing effects of a hot\r\nair blast and in that way induced many important improvements in the\r\nmetallurgy of copper, lead, and zinc.\r\n\r\nSiemens, Whitworth, Bell, Graham, Percy, Richards, Martin, Thomas,\r\nHolley, Hewitt, Fritz, Howe, Jones, and others made further important\r\nimprovements in the metallurgy of iron and steel in the United States\r\nand Europe.\r\n\r\nOne of the early American iron smelters was built by Governor Keith,\r\nin 1726, in New Castle County, Delaware. A rolling mill and forge were\r\nsubsequently built at Wilmington. The first American smelted iron was\r\nshipped to England from smelters in Maryland and Virginia in 1718. The\r\nBessemer steel process was introduced into the United States by Abram\r\nHewitt at the Troy smelter, New York, in 1865. From these beginnings\r\nthe iron industries of the United States have grown so that they now\r\nproduce more than two-fifths of the world's annual supplies.\r\n\r\nThe alloys of iron and steel have now attained importance and a new\r\nscience known as metallography has developed. Professor Arnold, of\r\nSheffield, Sherard Cowper-Coles, Roberts-Austen, Sorby, Tschermak,\r\nTschernoff, Wüst, and Ziegler have been active promoters of this branch\r\nof metallurgy, and a closely related one dealing with the effects of\r\nthe heat treatment of metals.\r\n\r\nDevelopments in the iron industries led to others in the metallurgy of\r\ncopper, lead, and zinc.\r\n\r\nThe application of the blast furnace to copper, lead, and zinc smelting\r\nwas chiefly made in America. One of the early furnaces was built in\r\nLeadville, Colorado, in 1877. From that time, pyritic smelting has been\r\nchiefly developed by American metallurgists. The metallurgy of lead,\r\ncopper, and zinc has reached a similar high plane to that attained by\r\niron and steel.\r\n\r\nThe metallurgy of gold and silver began to improve after the\r\ndiscovery of the Californian deposits in 1848. The stamper battery\r\nand amalgamation processes were improved; when sulphide ores were\r\nencountered, chlorination processes were developed. Subsequently, in\r\nresponse to demand for a cheaper chemical solvent for low-grade ores,\r\nthe cyanide and bromide processes were devised.\r\n\r\nThe application of the electric furnace to metallurgy greatly increased\r\nthe scope of metallurgists' methods.\r\n\r\nPichon, in 1853, described a small arc furnace with which he was\r\nexperimenting, and in 1878 Sir William Siemens built a furnace for\r\nreducing iron ores. Moissan made numerous tests of furnaces and\r\nsmelting methods in the nineties and did much to develop commercial\r\nelectric smelting. Faure, Cowles, Borchers, De Chalmont, Girod,\r\nHeroult, and others invented furnaces, smelting methods, and\r\nmetallurgical processes. The aluminum, carborundum, acetylene, and\r\nother important industries are developments from the electrometallurgy\r\nof iron and copper. Zinc, copper, nickel, silver, gold, and platinum\r\nplating and the electrodepositing of copper in the form of tubes by the\r\nElmore process are dependent upon the principles of electrometallurgy\r\nas is the electrorefining of metals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                                            Copyright, Keystone View Co.\r\n\r\nEDOUARD BELIN AND THE TELAUTOGRAPH, WHICH TRANSMITS PICTURES BY WIRE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEE DE FOREST, INVENTOR OF THE OSCILLATING AUDION]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AUTOMOBILE WITH RADIO EQUIPMENT FOR LISTENING IN EN\r\nTOUR]\r\n\r\nThe physical phenomena of the earth's atmosphere are studied under the\r\nscience of meteorology.\r\n\r\nThe art of weather forecasting is as old almost as mankind, but only in\r\nrecent years has it been placed upon a sound basis.\r\n\r\nTorricelli, in 1643, invented the barometer; Boyle, in 1685,\r\ndeveloped it and applied it to measuring gas pressures. The chemists\r\nof the eighteenth century, Boyle, Black, Rutherford, Priestley,\r\nScheele, Lavoisier, and Cavendish, all studied the chemistry of the\r\natmosphere. Franklin, in 1749, raised thermometers by kites to measure\r\ntemperatures. Balloon ascents were made by Jefferies and Blanchard,\r\nin 1784, for atmospheric observations. Soundings of the upper air by\r\nballoons, kites, and other apparatus have been conducted since the\r\nclosing years of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nMEDICINE AND PHARMACY\r\n\r\n\r\nMedicine was in a state of transition at the beginning of the\r\nnineteenth century. The great scientific discoveries of the eighteenth\r\ncentury had carried people away to such an extent that they showed a\r\ntendency to exaggerate their bearings upon medicine. The result was a\r\nwild diffusion of extravagant speculation and unsubstantial hypotheses.\r\n\r\nOne of the leading physicians of the eighteenth century, who wielded\r\nbroad influence throughout Europe, was Herman Boerhaave (1668-1738).\r\nHis work, entitled \"Aphorismi,\" published in Leyden, 1709, was\r\nimmensely popular. It was translated into all the European and several\r\nAsiatic languages. His reputation now depends upon his chemical\r\ndiscoveries and his medical teachings.\r\n\r\nOne of the most brilliant students of Boerhaave's medical school was\r\nAlbrecht von Haller (1708-77). Haller published many medical works and\r\nmonographs. His \"Elements of Human Physiology,\" (1759-66) is the best\r\nknown. The function of bile in the digestion of fats, the demonstration\r\nof Glisson's hypothesis that irritability in an excised muscle is\r\na specific property of all living tissues, and several theories\r\nexplaining the heart's activities, were among his best contributions to\r\nmedical science.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the existence of lacteal and lymphatic vessels in\r\nbirds, reptiles, and fish brought William Hewson into prominence and\r\nsecured him membership in the Royal Society. He published his monograph\r\non the coagulation of the blood in 1771.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cumberland Cruikshank (1745-1800) investigated the surgery of\r\nthe nerves, the functioning of the Fallopian tubes, the physiology of\r\nabsorption.\r\n\r\nThe electrical discoveries of Galvani, Volta, Benjamin Franklin, Henly\r\nand others caused much experimenting with the electric current in the\r\ntreatment of muscular diseases.\r\n\r\nThe Monros, father, son and grandson, by their wonderful teaching\r\nabilities, caused the medical teaching center of Europe to be\r\ntransferred from Leyden to Edinburgh in 1720. These men, and many of\r\ntheir students, did brilliant work in all branches of medicine.\r\n\r\nThe medical school which they so established in Edinburgh University\r\nstill maintains its great reputation.\r\n\r\nThe best anatomists of the eighteenth century were Cheselden, Pott,\r\nthe Monros, the Hunters, Desault, and Scarpa. Their work was largely\r\ntopographical. Surgical anatomy started with the writings of Joseph\r\nLieutaud (1703-1780), Albinus, Eisenmann, Soemmering, Mascagni,\r\nSandifort, and Caldani.\r\n\r\nThe anatomical textbooks in use in the year 1800 gave general accounts\r\nof the body's structure and included current theories of the functions\r\nof organs and their relationships to injuries and disease. More than\r\nhalf of the chapters were occupied with morbid anatomy and the recital\r\nof cases. The anatomy of the tissues and finer structures was neglected\r\nbecause the microscopes of the period were little better than simple\r\nlenses.\r\n\r\nPhysiology was studied by all medical students, but the science was so\r\nbadly developed that it never stood alone. For many years it formed a\r\npart of studies in anatomy. Early in the nineteenth century it began\r\nto expand, and in 1846 physiology was taught as a separate subject for\r\nthe first time at Guy's hospital, London, by Sir William Gull. Before\r\nthat it was taught by the professors of midwifery. It was the great\r\ndevelopments made in chemistry and physics, referred to in previous\r\nchapters, that pushed physiology to the front as an important branch of\r\nmedical science.\r\n\r\nDenman's \"Introduction to the Practice of Midwifery,\" the work of the\r\ngreatest living authority at the time of its publication in 1805, shows\r\nthat gynecology hardly existed at that time.\r\n\r\nAnesthetics and antiseptics, together with the systematic employment of\r\nabdominal and bimanual palpation, all were revolutionary discoveries of\r\nthe nineteenth century, unknown when Denman presided over the obstetric\r\ndepartment of the Middlesex Hospital.\r\n\r\nWhen the nineteenth century opened, medical men were unaware of the\r\nvalue of auscultation and percussion. They were familiar with the\r\nsymptoms of fevers and with diseases of the heart and chest, but they\r\nhad no means of determining differences between them. Textbooks of that\r\ntime show that the now common forms of heart disease were known only\r\nfrom post-mortem inspections. But they distinctly state that physicians\r\nwere unable to determine, in case of changes in stricture of the\r\nheart's valves, what part was affected. The seat of disease in heart\r\nand chest troubles could not be located.\r\n\r\nParasitology was no better advanced. Books published as late as 1810\r\nindicated that parasites, like hydatids, threadworms, etc., were very\r\npuzzling phenomena to the physician.\r\n\r\nThe status of surgery throughout the eighteenth century was very low.\r\nThe best work was done in France and Holland, until Cheselden, the\r\nHunters, the Monros, and Abernethy established their schools in England\r\nand Scotland. German medical practitioners were barbers until after\r\nthe army authorities formed the Medico-Chirurgical Pépinière in Berlin\r\nin 1785. There were several good medical schools in the United States\r\nin 1800 including those of the King's College, New York, and of the\r\nHarvard, Dartmouth, and Philadelphia Colleges, and the University of\r\nPennsylvania. There were also numerous medical societies. European\r\nmedical and surgical textbooks were used like those of Cheselden,\r\nMonro, Haller, Boerhaave and Sydenham. Medical practice was on the\r\nsame plane in America as in Europe. There were many patent remedies\r\nused, but the authorities recognized the importance of regulating the\r\npractice of medicine. Regulation acts were passed in New York City in\r\n1760, New Jersey in 1772, and a general quarantine act was enacted by\r\nCongress in 1799.\r\n\r\nThe modernization of medicine was brought about to a large extent\r\nby the publication of the \"Conservation of Energy\" by Helmholtz, in\r\n1847, and Darwin's \"Origin of Species,\" in 1859. These books cleared\r\naway completely the myths and legends which had surrounded medicine\r\nat earlier periods, and taught medical students the strict need of\r\nproceeding entirely upon scientific grounds precisely as chemists,\r\nphysicists, engineers, and others were already doing with wonderful\r\nsuccess. Darwin's biological teachings appealed very strongly to\r\nmedical men and influenced all their activities.\r\n\r\nVirchow's \"Cellular Pathology,\" published in 1858, Huxley's textbooks\r\non \"Physiology\" (1866) and on \"Vertebrate and Invertebrate Anatomy\"\r\n(1871-77) Haeckel's \"General Morphology\" (1866), and numerous medical\r\nencyclopedias and textbooks on practice and special diseases were the\r\nresult of the new scientific spirit. New medical associations were\r\nformed and these promoted discussions, the reporting of observations,\r\nand the publication of innumerable monographs. Medical journals and\r\nmagazines of a high character did fine educational work.\r\n\r\nThe investigations on fermentation and putrefaction made in France\r\nby Pasteur caused Joseph Lister, professor of surgery at Glasgow\r\nUniversity, to reflect upon the great mortality witnessed daily in the\r\nhospitals from pyæmia, erysipelas, tetanus, septicemia, gangrene, and\r\nother similar diseases. He observed that in spite of his great care\r\nto maintain scrupulous cleanliness in treating wounds, 45 per cent of\r\nhis surgical cases were mortal. Pasteur's dictum that putrefaction is\r\na micro-organic phenomenon, caused Lister to experiment with the view\r\nof preventing the development of microorganisms in wounds. Beginning\r\nwith weak solutions of zinc chloride and zinc sulphite, he accidentally\r\ntried carbolic acid, securing surprising results, and two years\r\nlater, in 1867, he published his monograph on antiseptic surgery which\r\ninstantly became world-famous. Lister, instead of being carried away\r\nby the celebrity he attained, turned his attention to the scientific\r\ndevelopment of his important discovery. He investigated lactic-acid\r\nfermentation, the relation of bacteria to flesh inflammations and to\r\nthe best methods of treating wounds antiseptically.\r\n\r\nLister, however, was not the first to employ antiseptics in the\r\ntreatment of wounds, and his great contribution to medical practice was\r\ndue to the systematic manner in which he experimented. He was not a\r\nbrilliant surgeon, but a deliberate and careful one whose chief desire\r\nwas to have the patient recover. His whole surgical career was guided\r\nby this principle which proved so successful that before his death\r\nthe whole medical profession saluted him as master, and when he died,\r\nrejoiced that his remains were entombed in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nTheodor Billroth was one of Lister's greatest disciples. He introduced\r\nLister's methods into continental surgery and through their use\r\nimproved the treatment of wounds and opened up new fields in the\r\nsurgery of the alimentary tract. He was the first to make a resection\r\nof the esophagus and pylorus and to excise the larynx.\r\n\r\nMikulicz-Rodecki, a Pole, was Billroth's chief assistant. He was also\r\na pioneer in Lister's practice. Specializing on the surgery of the\r\nalimentary organs, he promoted antiseptic methods and introduced the\r\nmodern modes of exploring the esophagus and stomach. He was also a\r\nmaster in the treatment of diseases of the mouth.\r\n\r\nFelix Guyon applied Lister's system to surgical treatment of the\r\ngenitourinary ailments, and became a leader in this class of surgery.\r\nBernard Naunyn, a well-known German writer on surgery, became a leading\r\nauthority on diabetes and diseases of the liver and pancreas. Jean\r\nMartin Charcot made the Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris, the greatest\r\nof the world's neurological clinics. He was also a great authority\r\non diseases of the biliary passages and kidneys. Sir James Paget,\r\nSir Jonathan Hutchinson, Sir William Gull, Jenner, Wilks, Spencer\r\nWells, and Clifford Allbutt, besides doing much by their writings\r\nto advance the practice of medicine, all closely allied themselves\r\nwith large hospitals, giving as much attention to the hospitals as to\r\nthe treatment of disease. Modern hospitals are largely due to their\r\npioneering work.\r\n\r\nLouis Pasteur's studies in fermentation led to the discovery of\r\nlactic-acid bacteria and this was the starting point for a number of\r\nrevolutionary discoveries in bacterial diseases. Infectious diseases\r\nwere placed in new categories by his work.\r\n\r\nThe etiology of traumatic infectious diseases was advanced by the\r\nresearches of Robert Koch (1843-1910). His work in discovering the\r\ncholera vibrio, the microorganisms of Oriental ophthalmia and his\r\nresearches on the nature and treatment of tuberculosis, made his name\r\nknown everywhere. His isolation of the tuberculosis germ in 1882,\r\nand that of Asiatic cholera in 1884, were leading steps toward the\r\ndiscovery of a great number of disease germs.\r\n\r\nFevers, like typhus, typhoid, yellow fever, and malaria, a few\r\ngenerations ago, took a great annual toll of lives. The work of\r\nthe men mentioned above, Lister, Pasteur, Koch, and the French\r\nphysiologist, Claude Bernard, gave medical men the means of curbing the\r\nravages of these diseases so that to-day they are incidental annoyances\r\nrather than human scourges.\r\n\r\nThe germ of typhoid fever was discovered in 1880 by Eberth. The cocci\r\nof pneumonia were isolated by Frankel in 1886.\r\n\r\nModern surgery has been greatly facilitated by the employment of\r\nnumerous anesthetics, chemicals which possess the power of inducing\r\nlocal or general insensibility. Soporific drugs have been used in\r\nsurgical operations since the remotest antiquity, but modern practices\r\nin the employment of anesthetics followed the discoveries of Faraday in\r\n1818. He described the properties of nitrous oxide, or ether and other\r\ngases in that year and suggested their use in medicine.\r\n\r\nJohn Godman (1822), James Jackson (1833), and Drs. Wood and Bache\r\n(1834) were among American medical men who made use of Faraday's\r\nsuggestions. Dr. Horace Wells, a dentist at Hartford, Connecticut,\r\nused ether in 1844. Two years later W. T. Morton, a dentist in Boston,\r\nemployed it successfully. Chloroform was described as a useful\r\nanesthetic by Dr. Flourens, of Paris, in 1847, the year in which Sir\r\nJames Simpson introduced ether as an anesthetic in obstetric practice.\r\n\r\nMesmer introduced hypnosis into medical practice about 1777, and in\r\n1784 Benjamin Franklin reported favorably on the medical value of what\r\nhe called magnetic sleep. Alexandre Bertrand, about 1831, described the\r\nnature of hypnosis and in 1841 James Braid employed it in his English\r\nmedical practice. The employment of hypnosis has not become general,\r\nalthough it is recognized that in certain nervous troubles there is a\r\nfield for it.\r\n\r\nAmong other American medical men who advanced their science in the past\r\nwere James Marion Sims (1813-1883) and Thomas Emmet, who acquired wide\r\nfame for successful methods of operating in obstetric diseases. William\r\nBeaumont (1785-1853) investigated the offices of the gastric juice and\r\ndevised treatment for digestive troubles. John Shaw Billings served his\r\nprofession by compiling, with the assistance of Robert Fletcher, an\r\nIndex Catalogue of the Surgeon General's library, Washington.\r\n\r\nPharmacology is as old as medicine. The medicinal qualities of herbs,\r\nroots, and gums were known to primitive man. There have been herbalists\r\nand druggists in all important communities at all times. Scientific\r\npharmacology, however, is just as new as modern medicine. Cordus\r\npublished a pharmacopœia, which listed drugs in use in 1535. Since\r\nthat time many such works have appeared. The second of the Monros of\r\nEdinburgh University Medical School, Magendie, and Claude Bernard\r\nplaced pharmacy upon a scientific basis. They followed scientific\r\nmethods used by Fontana in Florence in 1765 in studying the effects\r\nof snake poisons. Pareira's \"Elements of Materia Medica\" was the\r\nleading textbook in 1842. This work gave very brief accounts of the\r\nphysiological effects of drugs. The physiological values were not\r\nproperly appreciated until about twenty years later.\r\n\r\nDrugs are now scientifically classified and prepared, the full\r\nresources of science being used in their manufacture. American\r\nchemists have invented machinery and methods of preparing new drugs.\r\nCitrate of magnesia was invented by Henry Blair, of Philadelphia. Many\r\nother valuable remedies came from his laboratory, including sirup of\r\nphosphates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY AND RADIOACTIVITIES\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the most marvelous scientific developments of the nineteenth\r\ncentury those in the electrical field claim universal attention. It was\r\nonly as recently as 1844 that Morse introduced electric telegraphy. The\r\ntelephone was introduced by Alexander Graham Bell in 1876 and Edison\r\nbuilt one of his early dynamos in 1878 and in 1879 made his first high\r\nresistance incandescent lamp for parallel operation. The first Edison\r\npower and lighting station was opened at 257 Pearl Street, New York\r\nCity, in 1882.\r\n\r\nAlthough electrical phenomena were understood in a general way\r\nthousands of years ago, they were not studied and applied to practical\r\npurposes until the sixteenth century when William Gilbert carried out\r\nhis classical experiments in the reign of Queen Elizabeth. The Leyden\r\njar was discovered in the early half of the eighteenth century. From\r\nexperiments carried out with these jars a great number of important\r\ninventions were derived and our knowledge of electricity was for many\r\nyears dependent upon researches of this kind. Benjamin Franklin in\r\nexperimenting with the Leyden jar found that its electrical discharges\r\nwere similar to those of lightning and he subsequently discovered that\r\nthe inner part of the jar, when charged with a frictional current, was\r\npositively electrical while the outer portion was negative.\r\n\r\nThe voltaic pile was invented in 1796 as a result of Galvani's\r\nexperiments in physiological electricity and Sir Humphry Davy exhibited\r\nthe first practical electrical lamp before the Royal Society in 1809.\r\nThe dynamo was, in substance, invented by Faraday, and described by\r\nhim before the Royal Society in 1831. This was, perhaps, the greatest\r\nof all electrical triumphs because it gave engineers a practical means\r\nof generating and using electrical currents of any desired dimensions.\r\nBunsen in 1840 devised a means for making carbon rods for arc lamps,\r\nand Edison made practical carbon incandescent lamp filaments in 1879.\r\nFaraday's invention promoted all of these lighting discoveries.\r\n\r\nThe engine-driven electric dynamo was made a practical machine in 1870\r\nand thenceforward became the source of power of a great multitude of\r\nsecondary machines, such as electric street cars, marine engines, power\r\nplants, and forging hammers.\r\n\r\nA new and profitable field was opened for the use of electricity by\r\nthe invention of the electric furnace. Sir Humphry Davy produced\r\nhis electric arc in 1808 and was greatly impressed with its fusing\r\nproperties. He melted many metals with the arc and found that it fused\r\nplatinum just as easily as an ordinary tallow candle melts beeswax.\r\nThe electric furnace, which is now extensively used in chemical and\r\nmetallurgical works, is simply a large electric arc provided with means\r\nfor containing the heat. Furnaces lined with carbon are now heated to\r\nover 4,000 degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nWhen the electrical manufacture of aluminum on a large scale was\r\nstarted at Niagara, Dr. Edward Acheson, who was impressed by the\r\nindustrial needs of cheap abrasives, accidentally discovered that by\r\nheating a piece of porcelain to a high temperature in an electric\r\nfurnace and bringing it in contact with pure carbon, the carbon was\r\nrendered very hard. In 1891 he carried on experiments with high\r\ncurrents and a mixture of ground coke and sand. He found a method of\r\nfusing these so that the oxygen of the sand passed off with carbon\r\nin the form of carbonic acid gas, and the reduced metallic silicon\r\ncombined with an equal atomic weight of carbon and produced a new body\r\nwhich he named carborundum. The success met with in making carborundum\r\nled to the devising of a method of manufacturing artificial graphite in\r\nthe electric furnace. A soft, non-coalescing graphite was made in 1906.\r\nThis is extensively used in lubricating heavy machinery.\r\n\r\nDr. Acheson produced the first chemically pure artificial carbon in his\r\nelectric furnace in 1911. By using pressure during consolidation this\r\ncarbon may eventually be converted into diamonds.\r\n\r\nAnother valuable product of the electric furnace, acetylene gas, was\r\ndiscovered in Dublin by Edmund Davy in 1836. Subsequently numerous\r\nchemists discovered means for making carbides. T. Sterry Hunt, an\r\nAmerican chemist, observed in 1886 that oxides of the alkaline metals\r\nand of calcium, magnesium, aluminum, silicon, and boron could be\r\nreduced in the electric furnace in the presence of carbon and could be\r\nalloyed with other metals. He also found that silicon and acetylene\r\ncould be made that way.\r\n\r\nT. L. Wilson, a Canadian engineer, in attempting to make aluminum\r\nbronze in an electric furnace, devised an experiment for reducing lime\r\nwith carbon. He found that this produced calcium carbide and secured a\r\npatent for the invention in 1892. Variations of this process are now\r\nused for manufacturing nitrogen and nitrates from atmospheric nitrogen.\r\n\r\nWireless developments have resulted from the work of many separate\r\ninvestigators. K. A. Steenheil in 1838 used the earth return in live\r\ntelegraphy and suggested the possibility of wireless telegraphy.\r\nJoseph Henry produced the first high-frequency oscillations in America\r\nin 1840. Lord Kelvin in 1853 enunciated the mathematical principles\r\ngoverning uncoupled electrical oscillatory circuits. Joseph Heyworth\r\npatented a wireless telegraphic process in 1862. Clark Maxwell in 1867\r\npredicted the existence of electromagnetic radiations and these were\r\ndemonstrated by Hertz in 1887. Hughes discovered the phenomena of the\r\ncoherer and Branby used Hughes's coherer for wireless wave detection\r\nin 1892. A. E. Dolbear secured United States patents for a system of\r\nwireless telegraphy using aerials in 1886. Sir Oliver Lodge described\r\nhis wireless system before the Royal Society in 1894 and in the same\r\nyear Popoff issued descriptions of his wireless system.\r\n\r\nWireless telegraphy became commercially practicable in 1897 when G.\r\nMarconi secured the promotion of the Wireless Telegraph and Signal\r\nCompany in England. Marconi succeeded in turning to commercial account\r\na long series of brilliant discoveries in electricity, and this success\r\nhas led to numerous kindred discoveries. De Forest's three-electrode\r\nthermionic detector, known as an Audion, invented in 1907 and improved\r\nin 1911 by Lieben and Reiss, in 1913 by Meisser and in 1914 by\r\nLangmuir, opened up great possibilities for sound transmission by\r\nwireless telephony.\r\n\r\nThe electric deposition and refining of metals have been referred to\r\nin previous chapters. Many industries are based upon these. Niepce\r\nproduced commercially successful photographs in 1838. Earlier, in\r\n1824, he had etched plates for printing and in that year published his\r\nphoto-engraving of Cardinal d'Amboise. Fox Talbot patented a mixture\r\nof gelatine and bichromate of potash to take the place of the bitumen\r\nused by Niepce as a plate coating. Gillot found in 1872 that Fox\r\nTalbot's method of making intaglio plates could also be used for making\r\nrelief blocks. In 1885-1886, F. E. Ives sealed two single-line screws\r\ntogether and made a new fine cross-line screen, which resulted in the\r\ndevelopment of the half-tone process. Ives at this time also developed\r\nthe three-color photo-engraving process.\r\n\r\nPhotography and photo-engraving are so widely used and are so\r\nintimately connected with our civilization that few people now realize\r\nthat the great industries based upon them are the results of a few\r\nscientific discoveries of a couple of American and European scientists\r\nmade only a generation or two ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GIFTS FOR TUTANKHAMEN BROUGHT BY HUY, VICEROY OF\r\nETHIOPIA.

The original is now in the Berlin Museum.]\r\n\r\nChemists had long recognized the fact that certain chemicals like\r\npreparations of zinc, fluorine, and phosphorus were phosphorescent. It\r\nwas found early in the eighties that Welsbach gas mantles, when placed\r\non a photographic plate and exposed in a dark room for two weeks,\r\nmade a fine picture. Invisible rays in the mantle imprint its image.\r\nRöntgen, in 1895, discovered what are now known as the X-rays. This\r\ndiscovery was the result of experiments begun in 1859 by Plucker to\r\nascertain the cause of fluorescence in light glass, and Sir William\r\nCrookes, between 1879 and 1885, carried out beautiful experiments on\r\nfluorescence. These were the immediate pioneers of the discovery of the\r\ncathode rays and the other great radio discoveries of recent years.\r\nCrookes, remembering Faraday's suggestions concerning a fourth state of\r\nmatter, expressed the opinion, in 1885, that the matter constituting\r\ncathode rays is neither solid, gaseous, or liquid, but in a fourth\r\nstate which transcends the gaseous condition. Perren found in 1895 that\r\nthe rays carried electrically negative charges and Sir J. J. Thomson\r\nnoticed that their velocities are appreciably less than the speed of\r\nlight. Owing, however, to their great momentum, hardly anything can\r\nlong endure their impacts. They fuse platinum and make diamonds buckle\r\nup into coke.\r\n\r\nElectrons, which constitute the cathode rays, were originally studied\r\nin Crookes vacuum tubes, though they are now found to pervade the\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nLarmor in 1897 proposed an electronic theory of magnetism.\r\n\r\nHenri Becquerel was the first to discover radioactivity. He made\r\nradiographs from uranium salts in 1896. M. and Madame Curie undertook\r\nthe investigation of uranium and found that among the minerals\r\noccurring in pitchblende, or uranium ore, bismuth and barium showed\r\nradioactive properties, whereas when these metals are found in their\r\nordinary ores they are not radioactive. This discovery led to the\r\nfinding of two new metals, polonium and radium. Radium is now obtained\r\nby fractional distillation of solutions obtained from American and\r\nAustralian pitchblende.\r\n\r\nHelium, one of the lightest substances known, was discovered in 1895\r\nby Sir William Ramsay, and liquefied, at a temperature 3 degrees above\r\nabsolute zero, or -270 degrees centigrade, by Onnes in 1908. Helium\r\nappears to be one of the ultimate products of the disintegration of all\r\nradioactive elements.\r\n\r\nSome of the most interesting discoveries about radioactivity are very\r\nrecent. Radium prepared from uranium in 1915 was found in 1919 to have\r\nincreased proportionately to the square of the time interval. The\r\namount of radium in some preparations was found to have increased ten\r\ntimes in four years. The old idea of the constant fluxation of matter\r\nwas thus shown to have been based upon a scientific truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nSCIENCE IN THE TWENTIETH CENTURY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that we are now in a great period of transition.\r\nScientific discoveries came so quickly at the end of the last century\r\nthat a recasting and readjusting of scientific conceptions had to be\r\nundertaken. This process was in progress when the World War began. The\r\nworld-wide disturbance led to temporary scientific infertility except\r\nin such directions as served the purposes of war. But therein science\r\nbecame allied more closely than ever before with certain branches of\r\nindustry, and the cooperation thus established has been recognized in\r\nall civilized countries as of the utmost value to the future progress\r\nof mankind.\r\n\r\nThe philosophic thought of each era generally develops in harmony\r\nwith social and intellectual conditions. The philosophical doctrines\r\nof the leading writers may, therefore, be taken as representative\r\nof the spirit of their age. When Darwin in the middle of the last\r\ncentury published his doctrines of evolution, of the struggle for\r\nexistence and the influences of living conditions upon survival of\r\nspecies, philosophy turned away from the utilitarianism and tolerance\r\nof Hamilton, Hume, and Mill and the positivism of the French to\r\nthe synthetic evolutionism of Herbert Spencer. One of the basic\r\nteachings of Spencer was the relativity of knowledge. The process of\r\nthinking involves relation, difference, and likeness. This is merely\r\nrelationing. Therefore no thought can ever express more than relations.\r\nThe primary act of thought through which we discover likeness and\r\ndifference underlies all our knowledge.\r\n\r\nA reaction against this new empiricism began in 1898, when William\r\nJames published his \"Philosophical Conceptions and Practical Results.\"\r\nThis work popularized the philosophy of pragmatism which denies the\r\nabsoluteness or ultimateness of the traditional antithesis between\r\ntheory and practice and relies for its justification upon the fact\r\nthat everything which we think about, and do, must first be willed.\r\nReality consists in pure experience quite independent of thought.\r\nBergson developed this philosophy of practicalism further and taught\r\nthat knowledge of reality comes through intuition and that life is\r\nmerely intuitive knowledge. Intuition, is deeper than scientific reason\r\nbecause it feels, and links us with, the eternal processes of nature.\r\n\r\nPhilosophic thought is now temporarily influenced by the revival of\r\nan old principle known as the principle of relativity. The popular\r\nname for this is the Einstein theory, because in 1905 Albert Einstein,\r\nworking on some theories developed by Lorentz and Fitzgerald, published\r\nhis first principle of relativity which suggested that the velocity of\r\nlight is constant, however the position of an observer may vary and\r\nthat space and time are variable. In 1917 Einstein enlarged this idea\r\nin order to include all the laws of nature.\r\n\r\nSpace and time are treated as just mental concepts. They lack the\r\nconcreteness of matter, but they compose the framing of the universe\r\nand give it form and continuity. Consequently we see so much of\r\nthem that we attribute reality to them. The theory of relativity\r\nsuggests that time is not continuous. There is no identity of instants\r\nat different places. The present instant really does not extend\r\nbeyond this immediate point. At other points there are instants\r\nolder, younger, and contemporaneous with this instant. They are,\r\nhowever, quite distinct from this one. In order for an instant to be\r\nsimultaneous it would be necessary that it should occur at the same\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nAn object or event gains its substance and form from activities of our\r\nminds. Any meaning or significance that an object or event has is also\r\nderived from our minds. The reality of the universe is an activity, or\r\nseries of activities, which are manifested in life and mind.\r\n\r\nThe relativity of space is illustrated by an example given by Professor\r\nHenri Poincaré. Assume that I meet you in Wall Street, New York, and\r\nsay, \"I will meet you here again at this time to-morrow.\" You promise\r\nto do so. But you could not keep such a promise except with regard to\r\nposition on the surface of the earth, because between now and to-morrow\r\nthe earth will have moved over an enormous distance carrying Wall\r\nStreet and a great mass of other things with it. The sun also will have\r\nmoved away the stars, carrying the earth with it.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting mental picture is drawn by Professor Herbert\r\nWildon Carr to illustrate the philosophical meaning of the principle\r\nof relativity. Suppose that on a very frosty morning we were to see a\r\nwatery vapor in the air we breathe condense into a little cloud and\r\nafter floating around a while gradually disappear and become reabsorbed\r\nin the atmosphere. Assume that at the moment of this reabsorption we\r\nshould undergo an instantaneous transformation of all our proportions\r\nso that our new dimensions become infinitesimal in comparison with our\r\nformer state. Do you think that we would recognize the fact that we had\r\nchanged? The theory of relativity declares that we would not know what\r\nhad happened, because with the alteration in proportions the ratios\r\nwould remain constant. The change would express itself in the new\r\ndimensions of objects around us. The little globules of water composing\r\nthe little cloud would now appear like stars and planets occupying\r\nimmense areas in distant spaces, far apart from each other, and all\r\nundergoing a slow age-long evolution. Such a change would be signalized\r\nas a new time and a new space.\r\n\r\nYet the principle of relativity does not appear to our physical senses\r\nto represent a truth of nature. It is noteworthy that the principle\r\nof relativity is usually invoked when conditions are unstable, when\r\nthought is confused, and when a period of readjustment is in progress.\r\nThus the Einstein theory may be representative of present-day\r\nharmonies, but yet may prove, in the future, to have been merely a\r\npassing philosophic mood.\r\n\r\nBagehot, a shrewd observer, writing in 1868 about the changes wrought\r\nby Darwin's evolutionary theory, said: \"There is scarcely a department\r\nof science or art which is the same, or at all the same, as it was\r\nfifty years ago. A new world of inventions has grown up around us which\r\nwe cannot help seeing; a new world of ideas is in the air, and affects\r\nus though we do not see it.\" Those were very true words more than half\r\na century ago, yet they serve to describe present conditions!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL INDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  A, vowel sound, record of, iv, 234\r\n\r\n  Aard-vark, xii, 281-2\r\n\r\n  Abacus,
