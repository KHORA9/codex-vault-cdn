But a slight investigation of the simple arts by\r\nwhich the nourishment of man is effected, or of some of those wonders of\r\ncreative power which daily present themselves to view, cannot, in her\r\nopinion, be deemed an improper exercise even at an early age.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVISITS TO A FARM HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n_Cows._\r\n\r\n\r\n“What a delightful morning!” exclaimed little Arthur Benson on opening\r\nhis eyes, and seeing the sun shine bright into his room; “Charles,\r\nCharles,” continued he, turning to his brother, who was still asleep,\r\n“let us get up directly, and we shall have time for a little walk before\r\ngrandpapa and grandmamma come down stairs.” Charles obeyed the summons,\r\nand they were soon dressed. They then went into the garden, and from the\r\ngarden into the field adjoining; both highly pleased with all they saw,\r\nfor they had never slept out of London before, and the country was quite\r\na new scene to them. “See,” said Charles, “how all the cows are gathered\r\ntogether by that gate; and here comes a man they call old Ralph with a\r\npail on his arm. Pray, Ralph, what do the cows want there?” “They want\r\nto be milked,” said Ralph, “and through that gate is the way to the farm\r\nyard.” “Are _you_ going to milk them, and may we come with you?” inquired\r\nArthur.\r\n\r\nLeave being given, they tripped along by the side of the good old\r\nservant; but both stood at some distance behind when they came near the\r\ncows, as they felt rather afraid of going close to such large animals.\r\n“Why, now, masters, what is there to be afraid of?” said Ralph, who found\r\nthey had left off talking and suddenly shrunk back. “The cows will not\r\nhurt you, if you do not hurt them.” “Don’t they sometimes toss people\r\nwith their great horns?” asked Charles. “Here and there you may meet with\r\na vicious one,” replied the man, “but in common they are very gentle.”\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ I remember my papa told me never to run in the way of the cows\r\nthat we meet in London streets.\r\n\r\n_Ralph._ Aye, that is a very different thing. The poor cattle are not\r\nused to be there, so sometimes they may be frightened; and then, the\r\nbutchers are often cruel, and will beat and drive them about, as I have\r\nheard, so that for what I know it may be best to keep out of their way;\r\nbut here there is nothing of the sort. I do not ill use them, and they\r\nare always quiet with me.\r\n\r\nThe little Bensons then recovered from their fears, and wanted to milk\r\nthe cows themselves. The trial was made, and they were surprised to find\r\nthat they were not able to do it as well as Ralph. Had they been older,\r\nthey would have known that there are many things which are easy to those\r\nwho are accustomed to do them, that one who had never tried would find\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\n“Pray, Ralph,” asked Arthur, “why has the young calf that thing full of\r\nspikes round his mouth? See, he wants to suck the black cow, and she will\r\nnot let him. Cannot you take it off?”\r\n\r\n“Oh no, master Arthur, it is time the calf should be weaned. He is old\r\nenough now to eat grass, and we want the milk for the dairy; so we put\r\nthe spikes on him, and because of them, as they would hurt her, the\r\nmother will not let him suck any more.”\r\n\r\n“Is he to be killed?” inquired Charles.\r\n\r\n“Not at present,” replied the old man. “Master means to keep him to draw\r\nin the team.”\r\n\r\n“To draw in the team!” said Charles with some surprise.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” returned Ralph; “we have always a team of oxen. You may see them\r\nploughing in that field yonder; just there,” continued he, pointing with\r\nhis finger, “beyond the holly hedge.”\r\n\r\n“I see them; I see them,” said Arthur. “Poor creatures! how slow they go!\r\nAre not they tired, Ralph?” “No, sir,” replied Ralph, “they do not move\r\nso quick as horses; but they are vastly stronger. And though it is not\r\nalways quite so easy to manage them, yet on the whole they answer very\r\nwell.”\r\n\r\nRalph had now finished milking: and taking the little boys into the\r\nstable, he showed them a baby calf, as he called it, that was to be sold\r\nto the butcher the next day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Page 6._\r\n\r\n_The baby Calf._\r\n\r\n_London. Published by W. Darton Jun. Oct. 5, 1815._]\r\n\r\n“O you pretty little thing!” said Arthur. “Only look, Charles, at these\r\nspots on its back. I should like to have it for my own. Why must it be\r\nkilled, pray?”\r\n\r\n_Ralph._ To serve us for food, master Arthur. If we were to suffer all\r\nthe cattle to live, they would eat all the grass and corn that we could\r\ngrow; and then we should be starved, and you would not like that.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ No, I don’t want to starve; only I do not like to have things\r\nkilled.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Mr. Mansfield came into the stable.\r\n\r\n“We were talking about this poor calf, grandpapa,” said Charles. “Ralph\r\nsays it is to be killed to-morrow to make veal. I am sorry for it; it\r\nhas such a pretty coat!”\r\n\r\n“It cannot be helped, my dear,” replied his grandfather. “But when it\r\nis dead, do you know what will be done with its pretty coat?” The boys\r\nanswering they did not, “It will be sold,” said he, “to the tanner, who\r\ndresses the skins of cattle, or _hides_ as they are called; and when it\r\nis properly prepared, it makes that beautiful, smooth kind of leather,\r\nthat the large books you were looking at last night were bound with. It\r\nis often prepared to write upon, and is then called vellum. The skins of\r\noxen and cows make a thick coarse leather, such as the soles of our boots\r\nand shoes.”\r\n\r\n“And what becomes of the hair?” asked Charles.\r\n\r\n“After the hide has been soaked for a long time,” replied Mr. Mansfield,\r\n“it comes off easily, and is put into that kind of mortar which is used\r\nto plaster walls, in order to keep them from crumbling and falling away.\r\nDid you never see in a white wall broken down in part, a heap of short\r\nhairs, and here and there perhaps a little loose piece of mortar hanging\r\nto them?”\r\n\r\nArthur said he had, but he did not know it was cow-hair; and added, he\r\ncould not have thought it could have been of any use.\r\n\r\n“Every thing is of use, my dear,” said Mr. Mansfield. “I doubt if you\r\ncan name a part of the cow that will not turn to some account.”\r\n\r\n“What the hoofs, grandpapa?” said Charles.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Charles,” returned Mr. Mansfield. “The hoofs and the parings of\r\nthe skin, by being boiled down to a strong jelly, make the glue which\r\ncarpenters use to join things together.”\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ The horns—Oh, I know what is done with the horns. I have seen\r\nhorn lanterns, and I have got a little box at home that mamma says is\r\nmade of horn.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ Very well, Arthur. And you may have seen boxes, and\r\nknife-handles, and combs, and many other things, made of the bones of the\r\nox. Even the dung is of some use. It is a good manure for land; it is\r\nused in the process for bleaching linen; and poor women pick it up when\r\nit is dry, and make fires of it, to save coals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n_The Dairy._\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Mansfield, hearing how much her little grandsons had been pleased\r\nwith the cows, after breakfast took them into the dairy, to show them\r\nwhat was done with the milk which those useful animals give in such large\r\nquantities. The dairy was a little room with a brick floor, facing the\r\nnorth, and kept very cool, by means of a latticed window that let in\r\nfresh air. It was necessary that it should be built in that way, because\r\nheat soon turns milk sour. Round the room were fixed a sort of trays\r\nlined with lead, which then were all filled with milk.\r\n\r\n“Grandmamma, what is to be done with this milk?” inquired Arthur.\r\n\r\n“It is set for cream,” answered Mrs. Mansfield; “and the cream will be\r\nmade into butter.”\r\n\r\n_Charles._ How is butter made, pray?\r\n\r\n_Grandmamma._ Come here, and I will show you. The milk is poured into\r\nthese trays, which are not deep, but broad, so as to cover a large space.\r\nWhen it has stood some time, the cream or greasy part, which at first is\r\nmixed with the milk, rises to the top in the manner you now see. Then\r\nit is skimmed off with this ladle, and put into a pan by itself. This\r\nis done twice a-day; and when there is cream enough, it is churned into\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ Is there any churn here, grandmamma? Sister Kate has got a\r\nplaything churn, but I never saw one fit for real use.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mansfield pointed to a large barrel fixed on a stand, with a\r\nwinch handle to turn it, and told him that was the churn. Charles was\r\nsurprised, and said it was not at all like his sister’s.\r\n\r\n_Grandmamma._ Perhaps not. Sometimes they are made like a pail, with a\r\nlong stick to pull up and down; but these I have give less trouble, and,\r\nI believe, are now common.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Page 14._\r\n\r\n_The Dairy._\r\n\r\n_London. Published by W. Darton Junʳ. Oct. 5, 1815._]\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Well, grandmamma, how is this used?\r\n\r\n_Grandmamma._ The cream is put in through that little square door, which\r\nis then shut quite close; and when the churn has been turned a good\r\nwhile, it is changed into butter.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ So then butter is nothing but cream shaken about? I should\r\nlike to see it made.\r\n\r\n_Grandmamma._ You cannot see it now, my dear, because Rose churned\r\nyesterday. But I will give you a little cream in a phial: and you may\r\nshake it till you make it into butter.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Oh, can _we_ make it so? I should like it very much indeed, if\r\nyou please, ma’am.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mansfield fetched a phial, and the two boys amused themselves a long\r\ntime with their experiment. But they found that with all their pains they\r\ncould not turn the whole into butter; their grandmamma told them there\r\nwas always some waste; that it was called buttermilk, and given to the\r\npigs.\r\n\r\nArthur and Charles, quite proud of their success, went to look for\r\nRose, that they might tell her they could make butter as well as she.\r\nThey found her in the dairy, where their attention was drawn to a new\r\ncircumstance. Rose was standing before a large tub, full of a white\r\nsubstance rather thicker than jelly, which she was very diligently\r\nemployed in breaking.\r\n\r\nThey forgot the butter they had intended to boast of, and both began to\r\nask a variety of questions, which she answered with great good humour.\r\n\r\n_Both the Boys._ What is that for? What are you doing now, Rose?\r\n\r\n_Rose._ Making cheese.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ Making cheese? Well, since I have been at my grandpapa’s, I\r\nhave seen things I never saw before.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ But how do you make it, Rose? What have you got there?\r\n\r\n_Rose._ Curd.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ What is curd?\r\n\r\n_Rose._ It is made from milk, master Arthur. When the cream is taken off,\r\nwe take the milk and mix it with rennet, and then—\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Rennet! What is that?\r\n\r\n_Rose._ A sour juice that is made by boiling a part of the inside of a\r\ncalf. We put a little rennet to the milk, which makes it part into curds\r\nand whey. This thick white part is the curd, and the thin watery part is\r\ncalled whey.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Is that the whey people take for a cold?\r\n\r\n_Rose._ No. That kind of whey is made with wine instead of rennet; but\r\nthe curd parts just in the same manner as this.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ I will ask our Sally to let me look at it the next time she\r\nmakes whey. But why do you break it?\r\n\r\n_Rose._ That there may be no lumps. Wait a little, if you please, and you\r\nshall see how I go on.\r\n\r\nShe then took a large round bag made of coarse cloth, into which she put\r\nall the curd, and pressed it with very heavy weights in order to squeeze\r\nout as much of the whey as she could. This done, she turned it out of\r\nthe bag into a vat which has holes like a cullender, and, leaving it to\r\ndrain, then told them the cheese was finished.\r\n\r\n“I did not know,” said Charles, “it was so easy to make cheese. But what\r\nis the rind, pray?”\r\n\r\n“’Tis the same as the rest,” replied Rose; “only, being left to the air,\r\nit grows hard in time.” Then leading them into another room, she showed\r\nthem a great number of cheeses; some were still soft, having been lately\r\nmade; others, that had been longer kept, were grown quite hard.\r\n\r\n“What is the whey good for?’ asked Charles, as they came back through the\r\ndairy.\r\n\r\n“We give it to the pigs,” said Rose.\r\n\r\n“So then,” said Arthur to himself as he walked away, “_butter and cheese\r\nare both made from milk; but the butter is the greasy part, and the\r\ncheese is the curdy_.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, master Arthur,” said Rose, “you are right, for that is our way\r\nof making butter and cheese in this country: but in many places, where\r\nricher cheese is made, they use the milk without skimming off the cream;\r\nand to make good cream cheese, the cream only is used when skimmed from\r\nthe milk.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n_The Pigs._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen dinner-time came, it happened that there were brought to table some\r\ncustards and gooseberry tarts, of which Charles was tempted to eat very\r\ngreedily. He had already been twice helped, and the servant was going to\r\ncarry away the remainder of a tart that had been left in the dish, when\r\nCharles, not satisfied whilst any remained, stopped him, and once more\r\nfilled his plate with it.\r\n\r\nThe footman stared; and his grandpapa and grandmamma looked at him with\r\nsurprise, but said nothing.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Mr. Mansfield led his grandsons into the yard, just at\r\nthe time his man was giving the pigs their supper. Arthur and Charles\r\nwere diverted at the eagerness with which the whole family squeaked and\r\ngrunted over their food, which they devoured with the utmost haste,\r\ntreading one over another as they scrambled for a share.\r\n\r\n“O grandpapa,” exclaimed Charles, “how droll it is to see the pigs eat!\r\nLook there! look there! One has got a cabbage leaf, and another wants it.\r\nNow it has got it away, and it eats it as fast as ever it can. And now\r\nit is come for more. I dare say they will soon empty the trough.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps so,” replied his grandpapa, smiling. “Pigs are as fond of\r\ncabbage leaves and bean stalks, as little boys are of gooseberry pie.”\r\n\r\nCharles blushed.\r\n\r\n“Hey, Charles!” continued he, putting his hand upon his head so as to\r\nlook full in his face, “this is not the first time to-day I thought I had\r\na pig for my companion. Do you know any body that ate voraciously, and at\r\nlast _emptied the dish_?”\r\n\r\nCharles softly answered, “Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I believe he is ashamed of his greediness,” said Mr. Mansfield;\r\n“I only advise him another time to be more upon his guard for fear we\r\nshould take him for a pig.”\r\n\r\nAs they were sauntering about, a sow with a fine litter of pigs at her\r\nheels came across the yard.\r\n\r\n“Pray, sir,” asked Arthur, “how many pigs may a sow have at once?”\r\n\r\n“From ten to twenty,” said Mr. Mansfield. “But as she has not milk enough\r\nto suckle so many, she casts off some, and seldom brings up more than\r\ntwelve.”\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ What food do they like best, sir?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Page 24._\r\n\r\n_The Pigs._\r\n\r\n_London. Published by W. Darton Junʳ. Oct. 5, 1815._]\r\n\r\n_Grandpapa._ They are not very difficult. They will eat almost any kind\r\nof rubbish and offal: but vegetables of all sorts are best for them.\r\nCabbage stalks, potatoe parings, bean and pea shells, they like very\r\nwell; and it is a good way to turn them out into the forests, where they\r\nmeet with plenty of acorns, and mast nuts that grow upon beach trees.\r\nWith their long snouts they turn up the ground, that they may get at the\r\nroots or plants: to prevent this, we are obliged to have a ring thrust\r\nthrough their noses, otherwise they would do a great deal of mischief.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ Are they of much use, grandpapa?\r\n\r\n_Grandpapa._ Not whilst they are alive. When dead, the flesh, you know,\r\nis eaten, and is called pork, or bacon if salted in a particular manner.\r\nThe lard, or some of the fat, is used in making many sorts of plasters,\r\nand the bristles are formed into brushes of various kinds; and are used\r\nby shoemakers and others in sewing leather, instead of needles.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ I like _little pigs_ much better than I do great old ones.\r\n\r\n_Grandpapa._ I cannot say the hog is a favourite animal with me. He is\r\nnot only ugly, but his habits of life are disagreeable. You may have\r\nobserved that he is very fond of grouting in the mire. Neither his\r\ngrunting nor his squeaking is pleasant music; and the whole race are so\r\ngreedy, that, if they have food enough, they will eat till they are too\r\nheavy to stand on their legs; even then they will lie on their sides, and\r\neat still. Sometimes the sow will go so far as to devour her own young.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Indeed? The unnatural brute!\r\n\r\n_Grandpapa._ I should have told you that their stomach is made very\r\nlarge, and requires an unusual quantity of food. But if we are disgusted\r\nwith the manners of a hog, we should be careful not to imitate them; as\r\nfilth, gluttony, and want of natural affection, must surely be ten times\r\nmore shocking in the creature man, who is blessed with reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n_Sheep-Shearing._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following day being appointed for sheep-shearing, a number of men and\r\nboys assembled at an early hour in the great barn. Arthur and Charles\r\nwent with their grandpapa to see the process, and were greatly pleased\r\nwith the hurry and bustle of the scene. The sheep were penned in a fold\r\nclose to the barn, and were fetched away by the lads one by one, as fast\r\nas the shearers were ready for them. A few days before, they had all\r\nbeen washed at a mill-pond, so that their fleeces were beautifully white,\r\nand they were so thick as to make the animals appear almost twice as\r\nlarge as they really were.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Page 28._\r\n\r\n_Sheep Shearing._\r\n\r\n_London. Published by W. Darton Junʳ. Octʳ. 5, 1815._]\r\n\r\nArthur observed with surprise, that the poor creatures were perfectly\r\nquiet during the time of their being shorn; although they struggled with\r\nterror when they were first brought out, and bleated piteously as soon as\r\nthey were set at liberty.\r\n\r\nHe wondered at the ease with which the men laid them on the ground, and\r\nafterwards turned them over from side to side, as was necessary in the\r\ncourse of the shearing. After watching one of the shearers for some time,\r\nhe began the following conversation with him:—\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Good man, does not it hurt the sheep to be pulled about in that\r\nway?\r\n\r\n_The Man._ They do not like it; but I try to hurt them as little as I can.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Are you not afraid of cutting them with the shears, when you\r\nput them down into the middle of the wool?\r\n\r\n_The Man._ We take care to feel our way, but now and then they get an\r\nunlucky snip. That man there, that stands by the door, has some tar that\r\nhe puts to them if they chance to be hurt.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Poor things! how cold they must feel when they lose such a\r\nquantity of wool!\r\n\r\n_The Man._ It is time they should be shorn now, master. This is their\r\nwinter coat, as one may say; and if it was left much longer, by little\r\nand little it would fall off of itself.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Then why don’t you let it come off of itself, instead of taking\r\nall this trouble, and teasing the sheep?\r\n\r\n_The Man._ My service to you, sir! What, are we to lose the wool, or to\r\nfollow the sheep from place to place wherever they choose to stray, in\r\norder to gather it after them? No, no; they may suffer a little at first,\r\nbut if the weather is warm they soon get over it.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ How many can you shear in a day, good man?\r\n\r\n_The Man._ Why, fifty, more or less. The quickest hands can finish one in\r\nten minutes.\r\n\r\nCharles during this time was helping a little girl to pick up the loose\r\nlocks of wool that were scattered over the floor. His brother turned\r\nround, and saw how he was employed. What should _he_ do? Every one was\r\nbusy besides himself, and he could not bear to be the only idle person.\r\nA message came to fetch away one of the women, whose task it was to\r\nroll up the fleeces and pile them together on a heap. Arthur offered to\r\ntake her place; and, after a few trials, he learned to tie them up very\r\ndexterously. He continued at this employment for some time, and rejoiced\r\nto find himself of some use.\r\n\r\nMr. Mansfield at length called the two boys to go away. They immediately\r\nobeyed; and Charles, taking hold of his grandpapa’s hand, asked him if he\r\ndid not think a sheep-shearing was a most charming thing.\r\n\r\n_Grandpapa._ It does very well in its season, my dear boy. Wool is so\r\nuseful, that the shearing-time always gives me pleasure.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ What shall you do with it, grandpapa?\r\n\r\n_Grandpapa._ I shall sell it to the wool-stapler; and, after it has\r\npassed through the hands of different manufacturers, you may perhaps meet\r\nwith it again in some shop, though so altered as not to be known for the\r\nsame. It will then be in the shape of flannel, worsted, cloth, or perhaps\r\nsome kind of stuff.\r\n\r\n“That is all very droll,” said Charles. “But when will there be another\r\nsheep-shearing, grandpapa?”\r\n\r\n“Not till this day twelvemonth, my dear,” returned Mr. Mansfield. “Wool\r\ndoes not grow very fast. In two or three weeks you will see the sheep\r\ncovered with a little short wool; and the traces of the shears will then\r\nbe worn away. As winter comes on, it grows thicker and longer; but that\r\nis not a time to rob them of their fleece. At last the year will come\r\nround, and then they will be again ready for the shearer.”\r\n\r\n“I am fond of sheep,” said Arthur; “and I like little lambs, they look so\r\ninnocent.”\r\n\r\n_Grandpapa._ They are gentle, timid creatures, and require the care of\r\nman more than almost any other animal; as they have neither strength to\r\ndefend themselves when attacked by their enemies, nor swiftness to run\r\nfrom danger.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ And they pay us for the care we take of them, by letting us\r\nhave their wool?\r\n\r\n_Grandpapa._ Indeed they do, Arthur; but not by their wool alone, for\r\nthey are useful in more ways than one. Mutton, which you know is the\r\nflesh of the sheep, is one of the most wholesome meats we have; some\r\nparts of the fat are melted down to make tallow. The skin is sometimes\r\nmade into parchment, and sometimes into leather, for gloves, shoes, and\r\nother things: and parts of the guts are twisted into strings for musical\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ What enemies have sheep, grandpapa? You have said they can’t\r\ndefend themselves against their enemies.\r\n\r\n_Grandpapa._ Wherever there are wild beasts, Charles, they have many\r\nenemies, as they all prey upon the sheep. Eagles will attack young lambs;\r\nso will foxes; and even dogs, if they are fierce, and not properly\r\ntrained.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ But I have often seen a dog along with a flock of sheep.\r\n\r\n_Grandpapa._ Yes; the breed that is called the shepherd’s dog is very\r\nuseful in managing them. They seldom bite, but will fetch those back\r\nthat have gone astray; and by barking at them alone, guide the whole\r\nflock much more easily than a man can do. When they have done their\r\nbusiness, you may see them come back to the shepherd, and follow him as\r\nquietly as possible.\r\n\r\nIn the evening a supper was provided to refresh the shearers after their\r\nhard day’s work, consisting of legs of mutton, and plum-puddings, with\r\nplenty of good ale. All was jollity and mirth. During the day a constant\r\nbuz of many voices might have been heard even at some distance from the\r\nbarn; but the business they were engaged in did not allow time for much\r\ntalk. At night, on the contrary, they had nothing to do but to divert\r\nthemselves, and every tongue was heard. They told merry stories without\r\nend, sang songs, and drank to the health of their kind master. Mr.\r\nMansfield himself staid with them for some time, encouraging them to be\r\ncheerful, and walked about to see that every body was helped. At length,\r\nhe left the party, followed by his grand-children, who immediately\r\nretired to rest, highly satisfied with the pleasures of the day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n_A Walk through the Fields._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, Mr. Mansfield asked the little boys if they were\r\ndisposed for a walk. Arthur replied that he should like it very much;\r\nbut Charles said he would rather stay at home with his grandmamma;\r\naccordingly they set off without him.\r\n\r\n“What pretty purple flowers grow in that field!” observed Arthur, when\r\nthey had proceeded a little way. “Pray, grandpapa, what are they?”\r\n\r\n“That is a field of clover,” replied Mr. Mansfield; “and it will soon be\r\ncut for hay.”\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ I never saw such pretty hay as that.\r\n\r\n_Grandpapa._ Oh, there will be no beauty in it. On the contrary, it looks\r\nmuch coarser and browner than what is made of common grass, which is\r\ncalled meadow hay.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ What becomes of the flowers then?\r\n\r\n_Grandpapa._ They dry and wither away. You do not suppose they would live\r\nwhen cut down. Did you ever see how hay is made?\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Yes, a great many times. A number of men and women go into\r\na field and turn the grass, and then they put it into cocks, and\r\nafterwards make a stack of it.\r\n\r\n_Grandpapa._ Why do they do all that?\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ To make it into hay.\r\n\r\n_Grandpapa._ Yes. But why does turning it about make grass into hay?\r\n\r\nArthur said he did not know.\r\n\r\n_Grandpapa._ Then I will tell you. The grass when cut down is full of\r\nmoisture. If you squeeze a blade in your fingers, it will be damp; and\r\nthat dampness is called sap. Now, while the sap is in it the grass will\r\nnot keep. If you were to make it into a stack, it would soon rot, and\r\nsmell so putrid you would not like to go near it. But when it is turned\r\nabout to the sun and the wind, till the sap is dried away, there is no\r\nmore danger, and you may stack it, and keep it for a long time.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ But if I had a field, grandpapa, I would never make hay. My\r\nhorses should go in and eat the grass when they wanted it; and I would\r\nsave myself the trouble of working for them.\r\n\r\n_Grandpapa._ I am afraid, Arthur, you would make a lazy farmer. Do not\r\nyou know that nothing in this world is to be had without trouble? and if\r\nyou are so very sparing of your pains, I fear you will not succeed very\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Why not, pray, sir?\r\n\r\n_Grandpapa._ Did you ever take notice of the grass in the winter?\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Yes; I believe it is then short and black.\r\n\r\n_Grandpapa._ The blackness is nothing but the earth among it; it is very\r\nthin at that time of the year. Did you ever observe a field just before\r\nit was cut for hay?\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Oh, yes. Do you know, grandpapa, we all took a walk in a field\r\na little while ago; and the grass was so very long that it came up to the\r\ntop of my legs; and little Kate cried, and could not get on at all.\r\n\r\n_Grandpapa._ You see then, that as there is much grass in summer and\r\nbut little in winter, your horses at one time would have more than they\r\ncould eat, and at another would starve. Yet this would be owing to your\r\nown fault: for God gives enough for the whole year; and all he requires\r\nof us is, that we should in the season of plenty lay up for the time of\r\nneed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n_The Walk continued._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next field they came to was sown with rye, which Mr. Mansfield\r\nsaid was a species of corn; and, although much coarser than wheat, was\r\nfrequently made into bread, and in many places formed the chief food of\r\nthe poor. He desired his grandson to gather an ear or two, that he might\r\nlearn to distinguish between that and barley, which grew in the field\r\nthrough which they were next to pass.\r\n\r\nArthur pulled up a root of rye, and then ran to overtake his\r\ngrandfather, who by this time had got over the stile, and was slowly\r\ncrossing the barley field.\r\n\r\n“Well, Arthur, what difference do you find in the growth of these two\r\nkinds of corn?” asked Mr. Mansfield.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Indeed, grandpapa, I don’t see any, except that the rye grows\r\nvery high, as high as the top of your hat, and that the barley only comes\r\nto my elbow.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ That is one difference, to be sure. Examine them well,\r\nand perhaps you may discover some other.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Oh, yes, I see, sir. The spikes of the rye are neither so fine\r\nnor so long as in the barley.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ Very true again. So you see you need never mistake\r\nbetween them. The straw of the rye is the longest, but the beard (you\r\nshould not call it the spikes) is shorter and coarser.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ I think the long beard of the barley gives it rather a silky\r\nlook, as it waves about with the wind. Pray, grandpapa, is barley sown to\r\nmake bread too?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ Sometimes it is used for that purpose; but the greatest\r\npart of what we grow in England is for making beer.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Beer! Is it possible that barley can make beer? Do you know,\r\nsir, how it is done?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ Yes; and you shall hear, if you wish to know. All grain\r\nis the seed of the plant; and before it can be put to any use it must be\r\ntaken out of the ear. Now, to do that, it is thrashed with an instrument\r\ncalled a flail. I suppose you have seen one, have you not?\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ I remember once passing at some distance from a barn, where a\r\nman was swinging something about, that looked like a bent stick; and he\r\nbeat the ground with it, and somebody said he was thrashing.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ That he certainly was. The corn was spread upon the\r\nbarn-floor, and he was beating out the grain with a flail. The next\r\nbusiness is to separate it from the chaff, or outside skin. This is\r\nsometimes done by turning a machine very quickly so as to cause a wind,\r\nwhich blows away the chaff, for it is as light as a feather. A more\r\nsimple method is, to throw the corn across from one side of the barn to\r\nthe other, against the wind. The chaff, being so light, is soon blown\r\nback, whilst the corn goes on a little further, and falls in a heap by\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ But, dear grandpapa, what has this to do with making beer?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ All in good time, my dear boy. You must _get at_ the\r\nbarley before you can _use_ it, must you not? The method of winnowing\r\nI have described, relates principally to wheat (for barley is without\r\nchaff); but the barley must be thrashed, and separated from the ear;\r\nafter which it is put for some days into a cistern of water. It is\r\nthen taken out and laid in heaps; when it ferments, and is ready to\r\nshoot out in the same manner as if sown in the ground. Afterwards it is\r\nspread thinly over a floor, and frequently turned; and when partly dry\r\nis carried to a kiln, a kind of oven, where it is dried. Having passed\r\nthrough all this process it is called malt, and the man whose business it\r\nis, is termed a maltster.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ I thought brewers made beer?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ You were right. Brewers buy malt. They grind it, and\r\nthen pour hot water upon it, to get out its strength and goodness. The\r\nliquor thus obtained, which is sweet-wort, becomes the most valuable part\r\nof the commodity; for the malt has lost its virtue, and is called grains,\r\nand is only used to feed pigs and cattle. The wort is afterwards boiled\r\nwith hops, which give it a bitterish taste instead of a sickly sweet, and\r\nkeep it wholesome and good. Then it takes the name of beer; and after\r\nfermenting for a little while may be put into casks and kept for use.\r\nAnd now, Arthur, do you think that you understand brewing? Shall you\r\nrecollect that malt is barley prepared in a particular way? and that beer\r\nis made by pouring warm water on the malt, and afterwards boiling it with\r\nhops?\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ I think I shall, grandpapa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n_The Pony._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Mansfield and Arthur were returning from their walk, in a lane\r\nat a little distance from the house they were met by Charles, who had\r\nmounted a pony belonging to his grandfather: it had taken fright, and\r\nwas running away at full speed. Mr. Mansfield stopped it by catching\r\nhold of the bridle; and as soon as he was satisfied that no mischief had\r\nhappened, and Charles was sufficiently recovered to be able to talk, he\r\ninquired what had led him to try his skill in horsemanship.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Page 52._\r\n\r\n_Charles on the Poney._\r\n\r\n_London. Published by W. Darton Junʳ. Oct. 5, 1815._]\r\n\r\n“Why, grandpapa,” replied Charles, “Robert had just come home with the\r\npony, and left him at the gate; and I wanted to ride; so I got upon him,\r\nand he ran away with me.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ As you have never been used to ride, my dear Charles,\r\nyou had better not get upon strange horses when you are alone. I wonder\r\ntoo that Plover should run away; he is in general very gentle.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ At first he would keep his head over the gate, and I could not\r\nget him to move. So I hit him with a stick I had in my hand, and that set\r\nhim off in a gallop.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ I fancy all was owing to your want of skill; for Plover\r\nis a very quiet creature, and easily managed; but he will not bear\r\nill usage; therefore, if you beat him much, I am not surprised at the\r\naccident.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ I am sure, grandpapa, Charles did not mean to be cruel, and use\r\nthe horse ill.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ He is so good a boy that I do not suspect him of it;\r\nand I only meant to give him a caution against another time. No, my dear\r\nchildren, I hope you will never take pleasure in wanton cruelty. My heart\r\nhas often ached at the barbarities I have seen practised on poor dumb\r\ncreatures.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Once when I was walking with papa, we saw a man beating a\r\nhorse about the head with the butt end of his whip, and my papa advised\r\nhim not to do so; but he said it was his own horse, and he had a right to\r\ndo as he liked.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ Nothing can give a man a right to be cruel. We may, it\r\nis true, make what use we please of our beasts, as long as we treat them\r\nwell, for they were made for our convenience; but God Almighty has given\r\nto them life and feeling the same as he has to us; and we make him angry\r\nwith us whenever we use them ill.\r\n\r\n“I often think, grandpapa, that it is very strange such large creatures\r\nas these,” said Arthur, patting Plover, who now walked quietly by the\r\nside of his master, “should suffer us to get upon their backs, and\r\nmanage them as we please. They are much stronger than we are; and I\r\nwonder they do not drive us away, and not carry us, and refuse to draw\r\nour coaches and do every thing we like.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ It would be astonishing, Arthur, if we did not consider\r\nthat our reason gives us a great advantage over all brutes. Some of them,\r\nit is true, are much larger, some much stronger, and others much swifter\r\nthan we; but by means of our understanding we can conquer the strongest,\r\nand tame the fiercest of them.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ How can we tame them, pray, sir?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ By methods which they cannot resist. Plover is stronger\r\nthan you, but a boy of your size who understands riding would be able to\r\nmanage him. He would pull the bridle on this side, or on that, according\r\nas he wished him to turn; and as he pulled, the bit would hurt the\r\nhorse’s mouth just enough to make him willing to go where he was wanted:\r\ntherefore, by our knowing how to manage a bit and a bridle, we are more\r\nthan a match for a horse in spite of his great strength.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ I understand you now, grandpapa. And I have something to tell\r\nyou. As we were taking a walk a little while ago, a dog came barking and\r\nsnapping, and I thought he was going to bite me; but my mamma called out,\r\n“Don’t be frightened, Arthur; pick up a stone to throw at the dog, and it\r\nwill send him away.” So I did, and to be sure he slunk off at once. Now\r\nwas not it my reason that made me conquer the dog, though the dog could\r\nbite harder than myself?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ Exactly so. You see, then, that although our bodies are\r\nnaturally weak and helpless, yet by our reason we are furnished with the\r\nmeans of strength and defence. So God has ordained; and therefore, though\r\nhe will not suffer us to be cruel to any of his creatures, yet, as our\r\nBible tells us, he said at the beginning of the world, that the fear and\r\ndread of man should be for ever upon all animals.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Mansfield finished these words, they reached the stable yard, and\r\nRalph came forward to unharness the pony.\r\n\r\n“Plover must be shod to-morrow, sir,” said he, as he looked at one of his\r\nhinder feet.\r\n\r\n“Is not it cruel, grandpapa,” asked Charles, “to drive nails into the\r\nhorse’s feet?”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ No, my dear, it is not. The nails only go into the\r\nhoofs, which are very hard, and have not any feeling; but if we did not\r\nput on these iron shoes, the hoofs, hard as they are, would soon be\r\nbattered to pieces when they travel over rough and gravelled ground.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Dead horses are of no use; are they, sir?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ Their flesh is given to dogs; but the skin, when\r\nconverted into leather, is used for making harness and some other things.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n_A Visit to the Windmill._\r\n\r\n\r\n“Do you know, my dear,” said Mrs. Mansfield to her husband, when they\r\nwere sitting at tea, “the miller has forgotten to send home the flour he\r\npromised to let us have last week; and Sarah has just told me we have not\r\nenough in the house to bake to-morrow! So what must we do? Can you spare\r\none of the men to go over and inquire about it?”\r\n\r\n“I am afraid, my dear,” said Mr. Mansfield, “they are all busy at\r\npresent; but when Ralph comes in he may go of the errand.”\r\n\r\n“It has just occurred to me,” rejoined Mrs. Mansfield, “that if you are\r\ndisposed for another walk this fine evening, you might go yourself and\r\ntake the children with you; and it will be a nice treat to them, for I\r\nknow they have never seen a mill.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, do go, grandpapa; will you, grandpapa? it will be so very\r\ndelightful!” said both the boys at the same instant.\r\n\r\n“Well, bring me my hat then,” said their indulgent grandfather. “I did\r\nnot intend to stir again to-night; but if it will give you pleasure, my\r\ndear boys——”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, sir! thank you, sir!” cried Charles, running for the hat.\r\n\r\n“I hope you won’t be tired though,” said Arthur. “You shall rest upon my\r\nshoulder all the way; and do not be afraid of leaning all your weight,\r\nfor I shall be able to bear it very well.”\r\n\r\n“You shall have my shoulder to rest upon too,” exclaimed Charles: “So I\r\ndare say, grandpapa, you will not be tired.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” replied Mr. Mansfield, putting one hand upon the shoulder of\r\neach, as he rose from the chair, “with two such kind little supporters, I\r\nshall not be easily fatigued.”\r\n\r\nAs they walked, Charles expressed his joy that they were going to see the\r\ninside of a mill, which was what he had long wished to do. “And, pray,”\r\ninquired he, “what is it like?”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ That you will see when you get to it: in the mean time,\r\nArthur, examine this wheat. I showed you barley and rye in the morning.\r\n\r\n“There is no beard to this,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ No; and the ear is heavier and larger. Gather one, and\r\ncount the number of grains it contains.\r\n\r\nCharles pulled violently, and drew up a root that had seven stalks\r\ngrowing from it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Farm House Page 64._\r\n\r\n_The Mill._\r\n\r\n_London. Published by W. Darton Jun. Oct. 5, 1815._]\r\n\r\n“Hold, you wasteful little fellow!” cried his grandpapa. “I did not tell\r\nyou to root up my field at one stroke. Let me see, however. Observe what\r\na wonderful increase here is. These seven stalks have all sprung from\r\none single grain, and each ear contains, perhaps, twenty grains; which\r\ngives us in all a hundred and forty grains instead of one.”\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ That is astonishing, indeed! So there always grows a hundred\r\nand forty times as much wheat as is sown?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ No, no, I did not say that. In this instance it is\r\nso; and sometimes it may even happen to produce more; but a great deal\r\nof seed rots in the ground, without ever growing at all: of what does\r\ncome up, some is spoilt before it is ripe, and the ears that come to\r\nperfection do not all yield so well as these. I believe, therefore, that\r\ntaking the kingdom throughout, we only gather about eight times the\r\nquantity we sow.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ How long is wheat growing, pray, sir?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ Nine or ten months generally. No sooner is the harvest\r\nof one year got in, than we begin to prepare for that of the ensuing\r\nyear. We plough the land, and sow it again immediately. Some seed,\r\nindeed, is not sown before the spring, but that never produces quite such\r\ngood crops.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ What is the use of ploughing, grandpapa?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ To break up the earth, which would otherwise get so hard\r\nthat no corn could grow in it. When a field has been ploughed, a man\r\nwalks over it, and scatters the seed all over the field. Then it is raked\r\nin by an instrument full of great iron teeth, called a harrow. Care must\r\nafterwards be taken to keep it free from weeds, but besides that nothing\r\nmore can be done. It is left for the rain to water, and the sun to ripen\r\nit.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ And when it is quite ripe, then the harvest comes, does it\r\nnot, sir?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ Yes. Then the reapers go into the field, and cut down\r\nthe corn with their sickles. They tie it up in bundles, which are called\r\nsheaves, when it is carried into barns, and thrashed out for use.\r\n\r\nAs they were conversing in this manner they arrived at the mill; and\r\nwhen Mr. Mansfield had given his orders, he asked leave to lead his\r\ngrandchildren over it. He then explained to them, how the sails, being\r\nturned round by the wind, were the occasion of turning different wheels\r\nin the inside of the building. He next pointed out to them two large flat\r\nstones, shut up in a kind of box. “You may see,” said he, “that all the\r\ncorn is made to pass between these stones. The understone is fixed; but\r\nthe upper one turns round, and presses so heavily upon it, as to bruise\r\nand grind the corn to powder.”\r\n\r\n“I understand you, grandpapa,” returned Charles. “And is that all that is\r\ndone here?”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ Not all, Charles; for the corn, though ground into\r\nmeal, wants sifting. To do that, there is a contrivance called a\r\nboulting engine, and you may look at it if you step this way.\r\n\r\nMr. Mansfield then opened a little door in the large wooden box, or\r\nbin, that contained the engine; when a quantity of fine flour flew out\r\ninto their faces, and powdered them all over. The boulter was made of\r\nframe-work, five or six feet long, round which a canvas was tightly\r\nstrained. “Now,” said Mr. Mansfield, “the meal is put into this boulting\r\nmachine, which turns round, you see, very fast when the mill is at work.\r\nThe quickness of its motion causes the fine flour to fly off through the\r\ncanvas; but the coarse and husky part, which is bran, not being able to\r\ndo that, falls to the bottom by itself. The use of shutting it up in this\r\nbox, is to prevent the flour from being scattered over the mill.”\r\n\r\nThe Bensons and their grandfather remained at the mill till they had\r\nthoroughly examined every part of it. They received much pleasure from\r\nseeing the different wheels and contrivances, and were diverted to find,\r\nwhen they came away, that they were so covered with flour as to look\r\nalmost as white as millers.\r\n\r\nAs they were returning home, Arthur observed, that having first seen\r\nthe wheat growing, and afterwards ground, they only wanted now to know\r\nhow flour was made into bread, to understand the whole process from\r\nbeginning to end.\r\n\r\nMr. Mansfield replied, that he could easily explain that. The flour was\r\nmixed with a proper quantity of water, and a little yeast put in to make\r\nit rise. “This,” said he, “is well kneaded together, and then it is put\r\ninto an oven and baked.”\r\n\r\n“But what is yeast?” inquired Charles.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ A scum that rises on the top of new beer.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Have not I, sir, seen to-day, some of all the different kinds\r\nof corn that grow here?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ I do not recollect our having met with oats. They do not\r\ngrow in one compact ear like the rest, for every grain has a separate\r\nlittle foot-stalk to itself. In this part of the country they are chiefly\r\ngiven to horses; but in Scotland, and the north of England, oatmeal cakes\r\nare frequently eaten instead of bread.\r\n\r\n“And now,” continued he, “I am not sorry to find myself near home. You,\r\nArthur, may likewise be glad to rest yourself, for you have been stumping\r\nabout almost all day.”\r\n\r\nThe boys declared they were not at all tired, and thanked their grandpapa\r\nfor the pleasure he had procured them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n_Poultry._\r\n\r\n\r\n“Grandmamma, pray where are you going?” asked Charles one morning, on\r\nseeing his grandmother walk out at the garden door.\r\n\r\n“To feed my chickens, my love,” returned she.\r\n\r\n“Then I will go with you, if I may,” said Charles. “And so will I,” said\r\nArthur: and he threw down his peg-top in a corner.\r\n\r\n“My speckled hen,” said Mrs. Mansfield, “came off her nest, yesterday,\r\nwith a fine brood of chickens.”\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ That is the one, is not it, ma’am, that has been sitting so\r\nclose ever since we came?\r\n\r\n_Grandmamma._ Yes, and for a fortnight before, which makes in all three\r\nweeks; the time hens always sit on their eggs.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ I think they must be tired of keeping still so long.\r\n\r\n_Grandmamma._ I believe, Charles, you would be tired of such confinement;\r\nbut birds do not seem to mind it at all. Though so active at other times;\r\nwhen they have laid their eggs, they are quite contented to sit still\r\ntill the young ones are hatched.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Do all birds sit for three weeks, grandmamma?\r\n\r\n_Grandmamma._ No: ducks and geese sit for a month; and pigeons and\r\nsmaller birds for about a fortnight. Now you may give them some of these\r\ngrits, and then you will have the pleasure of seeing them peck.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ Let me have a handful, if you please. Chick, chick, chick,\r\nchick! come here, poor chickey, and I will give you something to eat.\r\nDear grandmamma! they will not let me catch them; and look at the old\r\nhen, she is almost ready to fly at me.\r\n\r\n_Grandmamma._ She is afraid you are going to hurt her chickens, when she\r\nsees you run after them. Hens are often very fierce, if any one offers to\r\nmeddle with their young ones.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ Well then, poor things! I will not take you up in my hand, but\r\nI will give you your food on the ground. How pretty they look! They are\r\nthe colour of my canary bird.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ I see the old hen does not eat much herself. She only pecks\r\nabout the grits, to show them to her chickens.\r\n\r\n_Grandmamma._ She is a very good mother; so we will give her some barley.\r\nThat is the best food for the old ones.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ See, Charles, how oddly they drink! They turn up their heads\r\nwhenever they swallow.\r\n\r\n_Grandmamma._ By that means they let the water trickle down their\r\nthroats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Farm House Page 76._\r\n\r\n_The Poultry Yard._\r\n\r\n_London. Published by W. Darton Jun. Oct. 5, 1815._]\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Then why do not we do so when we drink?\r\n\r\n_Grandmamma._ Because our throats are not formed the same as birds’;\r\nfor we are provided with a muscle, which carries down the liquor by its\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ How the pretty creatures creep under their mother’s wings!\r\nand she puffs her feathers out, and makes herself as large as she can to\r\ncover them all.\r\n\r\n_Grandmamma._ You see how Providence has provided for the welfare of all\r\nhis creatures. Whilst they are too young to take care of themselves,\r\nhe gives to the parent a strong affection towards them, and wisdom\r\nsufficient to bring them up. The mother, though generally timorous, and\r\neasily frightened, to preserve her young ones will boldly turn round\r\nand face almost any danger. You observed that the hen forgot her own\r\nhunger, when she was teaching the little chickens to peck; now she covers\r\nthem with her wings to keep them from the cold, which, as they are not\r\ncompletely fledged, would probably kill them if it were not for her care.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ And what will she do when these little things are grown as big\r\nas she is?\r\n\r\n_Grandmamma._ Long before that time she will have cast them off. Brutes\r\nnever care for their young when they are able to shift for themselves.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ That is very different from us. I do not think my mamma will\r\ncast us off as long as she lives.\r\n\r\n_Grandmamma._ I do not think she will. And I hope, my dear boys, that\r\nin return you will never neglect _her_. A chicken, you see, could not\r\nbe reared unless the hen took care of it; but a child requires constant\r\nattention for many years; and even when grown up, the fondness of the\r\nparents still continues. Surely, then, nothing can excuse ingratitude and\r\nundutifulness towards them.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ No, grandmamma: so for the future I will always mind what my\r\npapa and mamma say to me; and I will try never to do any thing that I\r\nthink they won’t like.\r\n\r\n_Grandmamma._ That is a very good resolution, and I hope you will keep\r\nto it.—— Well, Charles, what do you say to the pigeons? They are pretty\r\nbirds, are they not?\r\n\r\n_Charles._ Indeed, ma’am, they are. I was looking at them falling head\r\nover heels, when up in the air.\r\n\r\n_Grandmamma._ Those are called tumblers, that fly in that way. There are\r\nmany kinds of pigeons. The white ones out there, with tails that stand up\r\nsomewhat like hens’, are called fan-tails.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ What must we feed the pigeons with?\r\n\r\n_Grandmamma._ You may give them a few tares, if you like; but here we\r\nhave no occasion to supply them with much food, for they come to the barn\r\ndoors, and pick up the corn that is scattered about.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ Are all those one brood, that sit together on the top of that\r\ncart-house?\r\n\r\n_Grandmamma._ No. Pigeons never lay more than two eggs at one time; and\r\nthe pair that are hatched commonly continue mates to one another all\r\ntheir lives.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ Now let us look at the ducks and geese, if you please. The\r\npond is nearly covered with them, I see.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ How very small some of them are! I should have thought that\r\nthey were too young to be able to swim.\r\n\r\n_Grandmamma._ Oh, they take to the water as soon as they leave the\r\negg-shell. They are web-footed, and that enables them to swim.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ What is being web-footed, ma’am?\r\n\r\n_Grandmamma._ Having a skin to fill up all the space between the toes.\r\nWhen they swim, they paddle, or strike with their broad feet against the\r\nwater; which gives them motion onwards.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ I suppose, grandmamma, you keep poultry for the sake of eating\r\nthem!\r\n\r\n_Grandmamma._ You are right. But do you know what is done with the\r\nfeathers?\r\n\r\n_Charles._ No.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ I do, ma’am. Beds and pillows are stuffed with them.\r\n\r\n_Grandmamma._ And what use is made of the long quill feathers, that grow\r\nin the goose’s wing?\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ I never have been told.\r\n\r\n_Grandmamma._ The quill part, by being cut into shape, is converted into\r\npens for writing.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ Do only geese furnish pens?\r\n\r\n_Grandmamma._ Some people write with crow-quills: but they are too small\r\nfor a bold hand; so that they are very little used. The quills of the\r\nturkey are too hard; and those of ducks and chickens, on the contrary,\r\nare as much too soft. Swan quills, however, make excellent pens; but they\r\nare too scarce to be in general use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n_The Deer._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Mansfield’s neighbourhood resided a Mr. Ashley, a gentleman of\r\nlarge fortune, and of a very obliging disposition. He had heard that\r\nArthur and Charles Benson were at their grandpapa’s on a visit, and one\r\nday he sent for them to play with his son William, a little boy nearly\r\nof their own age. The Bensons went, and William took them into the park,\r\nwhere they amused themselves for some time by the play of trap-ball. The\r\ngame was at last suddenly broken off by master Ashley, who threw down the\r\nbat upon the ground, exclaiming that his pretty tame fawn was coming in\r\nsight, and that he must go and stroke it. The Bensons were rather sorry\r\nto be interrupted in their play; but, as they had been early taught, that\r\nit was often necessary to give up their own inclinations to the wishes of\r\nothers, they left off with the utmost good humour. “Look at the pretty\r\ncreature!” said William Ashley, caressing the fawn. “I wish I had a bit\r\nof bread here: it would eat it out of my hand.”\r\n\r\n“I have found a piece of biscuit in the corner of my pocket,” said\r\nCharles. “Here it is. I will feed it, if you please.”\r\n\r\n“How old is he?” inquired Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Six weeks, or two months, I do not recollect which,” replied William.\r\n“But see, here comes the mother! I thought she could not be far off, for\r\ndoes never desert their young ones until the end of the summer.”\r\n\r\nThe little party was still admiring the fawn, when Mr. Ashley came, and\r\ntold them that dinner was almost ready.\r\n\r\n“We will come, papa,” said William, “as soon as we have done counting the\r\nspots upon my little fawn’s back.”\r\n\r\n“Pray,” inquired Charles, “are all deer spotted?”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Ashley._ No: their colour is various. Some are of a reddish cast,\r\nsome of a deep brown, some white, and others spotted like these. Observe\r\nthe herd that are feeding under those trees, and you will see a great\r\ndifference amongst them.\r\n\r\n“And those, sir,” said Arthur, “have all fine branching horns.”\r\n\r\n“They are stags,” returned Mr. Ashley. “The does are the females, and\r\nnever have any horns. But perhaps you did not know that even stags are\r\nwithout, for a part of every year?”\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Indeed, sir, I did not, and shall be obliged to you if you will\r\ntell me about it.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Ashley._ I will readily. Towards the latter end of February, stags\r\nshed their horns, and soon after fresh ones begin to grow. These are at\r\nfirst very tender; and the flies, when they are in that state, are often\r\nextremely troublesome to the poor animals. Whilst the horns are off, they\r\nseparate from each other, and endeavour to hide themselves from every\r\nother creature, as they are then incapable of making any defence; but in\r\nabout three months, when the new ones have grown to their full size, they\r\nassociate together again in large herds.\r\n\r\nAfter these observations, the whole party returned to the house, and\r\nentered the dining-parlour, and their conversation was interrupted by\r\nthe inquiries which Mrs. Ashley made, after the health of Mr. and Mrs.\r\nMansfield: but soon after dinner, William renewed the subject, by asking\r\nhis father, whether he might be permitted the next season to hunt with\r\nthe stag hounds?\r\n\r\nMr. Ashley replied, that he was much too young; and then turning to\r\nCharles, he asked him if it was his wish also to be a sportsman?\r\n\r\n“Indeed, sir,” returned Charles, “I don’t thoroughly understand what you\r\nmean by a sportsman; and I never wished nor even thought about it.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, a sportsman,” said William, “is a man who is fond of hunting and\r\nshooting, and other field sports; and if you knew what they were, I am\r\nsure you would like them, for I think they must be the greatest pleasures\r\nof life.”\r\n\r\n“In what way do they hunt?” inquired Arthur.\r\n\r\n_William._ Why, a stag is turned out into the country, and then, fly\r\nwhere he will, a whole pack of dogs follow him in full cry; and a number\r\nof gentlemen, mounted on fine horses, gallop after with the greatest\r\npossible speed: and they don’t mind what they come to; for they leap over\r\ngates, and hedges, and ditches, and ride down hills that are almost as\r\nsteep as precipices; and at last, when the stag can run no further, he is\r\ncaught by the dogs, who kill him; but sometimes his life is saved, that\r\nhe may be hunted again another day.\r\n\r\n“What a cruel diversion!” exclaimed Arthur, shocked at the thought of\r\nwhat the stag must suffer. “I am sure I could never take pleasure in\r\ntormenting a poor animal in that way.”\r\n\r\n“We huntsmen do not think of the _poor animals_,” returned Mr. Ashley.\r\n\r\n“Perhaps not, my dear,” said his wife; “but your want of thought will not\r\nprevent them from feeling pain and terror; and I must own, I am always\r\nsurprised when men of humanity join in such barbarous sports.”\r\n\r\n“Do you hunt any thing besides deer?” asked Charles.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Ashley._ Yes, my dear, foxes and hares; the former with fox-hounds,\r\nand the latter with harriers.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Pray, sir, are deer ever wild in this country?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Ashley._ Not the kind that we have in our parks, which are fallow\r\ndeer; but there is another species, properly called stags, somewhat\r\nlarger, differing in a few particulars from those that are wild in our\r\nforests. I do not mean that every body has a right to take them; for they\r\nare accounted the property of the king.\r\n\r\n_William._ I forget, papa, where you told me that fallow deer were first\r\nbrought from.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Ashley._ It is said, they came originally from Bengal: but they\r\nwere brought here from Norway by King James the first; and England is\r\nnow more famous for venison than any other country in the world.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ Is any use made of the skins, pray, sir?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Ashley._ Yes: the skin both of the buck and doe makes the soft thick\r\nleather, of which gentlemen’s riding breeches and gloves are made. The\r\nhorns are very hard and solid, and make excellent handles for knives and\r\nother utensils. They likewise contain a salt, called salt of hartshorn,\r\nfrom which is extracted spirit of hartshorn.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Ashley._ How should you like to go to Lapland, and ride over the\r\nsnow in a sledge drawn by rein deer?\r\n\r\n_Charles._ By rein deer, ma’am? What, have deer strength enough to draw\r\ncarriages?\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Ashley._ The rein deer, my love, is a very extraordinary creature.\r\nIt inhabits Lapland, and other cold countries, and answers to the\r\ninhabitants the purpose of most of the animals we have among us. It\r\nserves them instead of a horse, and draws their sledges with amazing\r\nswiftness over the frozen country. It supplies them too with milk and\r\ncheese, instead of the cow; and answers the purpose of our sheep, in\r\nfurnishing them with warm covering.\r\n\r\nProvidence, who has thus formed the rein deer capable of supplying the\r\nnumerous wants of man, has provided with wonderful care for its support.\r\nThat dreary country, where no grass will grow, and not any herb which we\r\nare accustomed to see, is nevertheless covered all over with a species of\r\nwhite moss, which serves as food for it. This is its only pasture; and it\r\ngets at it in winter, by scratching away the snow with its hinder legs.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Is the rein deer good to eat, pray, ma’am?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Ashley._ It is. So, when it has lived about sixteen years, the\r\nLaplander generally kills him for the sake of his flesh and his skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n_The Pheasantry._\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Ashley’s pleasure-grounds were very extensive; and in one corner of\r\nthe park he had inclosed four or five acres of land for keeping rare and\r\ncurious birds.\r\n\r\nEarly in the afternoon, he proposed to his young visitors to take a walk\r\nto the pheasantry, as it was called; an offer which they gladly accepted.\r\nThey entered the inclosure by going through a pretty cottage, where an\r\nold man lived who had the care of the birds.\r\n\r\nThe cottage was deserted; but outside the back door they found Maddox\r\nasleep in a chair, and his little grand-daughter Peggy hard at work by\r\nhis side.\r\n\r\nPeggy rose, and curtsied in a very pretty manner. Then having roused the\r\nold man, by telling him that ’squire Ashley was come, she sat down again\r\nto her needle. But master William, who was very fond of her, begged she\r\nwould leave her work while they stayed, and look after the birds with\r\nthem. On a grass plot close to the cottage there were three or four\r\nhens under baskets; and they had each a little brood belonging to them,\r\nwhich the Bensons mistook for bantams. But Peggy said they were young\r\npheasants; their eggs they often set under hens, as they made the best\r\nmothers of any fowl.\r\n\r\n“Are these _all_ we are to see?” inquired Arthur.\r\n\r\n“No, sir,” replied Peggy; “we have many that are full grown; only they\r\nare now scattered about, and hid among the bushes. I’ll call them.”\r\n\r\nShe then fetched out a pan with some of their food, which she scattered\r\nover the grass, calling at the same time in a particular manner.\r\nPresently several pheasants came from their hiding-places. They were\r\nrather shy at first; but by degrees they ventured nearer, and at last\r\nbegan to eat the food that was thrown to them. The boys admired their\r\nbeauty. The plumage of some was of a fine gold colour, variegated\r\nwith streaks of purple and green. These they learnt were called gold\r\npheasants. The silver pheasants were very handsome, although not quite so\r\nshowy. They were of a clear white, streaked likewise with purple on the\r\nneck and breast. The common pheasant was not equal in beauty to these;\r\nbut it had notwithstanding a great variety of colours, and was remarkably\r\nbrilliant.\r\n\r\n“What do you feed them with?” asked Charles.\r\n\r\n“Ants’ eggs and curds are most proper for them,” said Peggy: “but they\r\nwill eat oats and barley; and they pick up wood-lice, and earwigs, and\r\nother insects.”\r\n\r\nA loud squalling now diverted the attention of the little party to\r\nanother object. They looked up, and saw it proceeded from a peacock,\r\nwhich was perched on the top of a high tree.\r\n\r\nCharles inquired if any thing was the matter with him; he was answered\r\nthat they always made such noise. A little further in the woods they\r\nfound another peacock. His beautiful long tail did not trail after him\r\nin the usual way, for he had spread it, so as to make the feathers stand\r\nstraight out from his body; and the eyes, or large spots in the ends of\r\nthe feathers, being raised one above the other, had a very pretty effect.\r\nIn this state he marched about with a proud air, and turned himself\r\nround and round, as if to exhibit his gaudy appearance to every body\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nArthur observed another bird with a fine neck and head like the peacock,\r\nbut without his beautiful tail. In answer to his inquiries, Mr.\r\nAshley told him that it was a pea-hen, and added, that, with very few\r\nexceptions, the females, throughout the feathered race, were greatly\r\ninferior in beauty to the males.\r\n\r\nThe party now returned to the house, and Arthur, who liked to know to\r\nwhat purpose every thing was applied, asked Mr. Ashley, what was the use\r\nof the fine birds they had seen?\r\n\r\n“They are merely kept as curiosities,” answered that gentleman. “Now and\r\nthen we kill a young pea-fowl, to eat as a delicacy; but my chief motive\r\nin keeping them is, that I may have the pleasure of showing them to my\r\nfriends.”\r\n\r\n“Pheasants are eaten sometimes, I know,” said Charles.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said William; “but not gold and silver pheasants. The common ones\r\nthat fly about wild, are killed in the shooting season by the sportsmen,\r\nthe same as partridges and other game.”\r\n\r\n_Charles._ What do you mean by game?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Ashley._ Game denotes such kind of birds, or beasts, as are taken or\r\nkilled by fowling and hunting.\r\n\r\nThey were now arrived at the house, and Mr. Ashley left them; but the\r\nboys, at the request of Arthur, resumed their game of trapball.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n_The Story of Old Maddox._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning at breakfast, the two boys entertained their grandpapa\r\nand grandmamma with a full account of what they had seen on the preceding\r\nday; and both dwelt with particular pleasure on the beauty of the\r\npheasants.\r\n\r\n“Did you take notice of Harry Maddox, the old man who has the care of\r\nthem?” inquired Mr. Mansfield.\r\n\r\nThe children replied, that he was for some time talking with Mr. Ashley;\r\nbut that he took no notice of them, and that they had observed nothing\r\nparticular about him.\r\n\r\n“That, man,” said Mr. Mansfield, “shabby and mean as he now appears, was\r\nonce in possession of considerable property. It was his idleness alone\r\nthat reduced him to poverty.”\r\n\r\n“How so, grandpapa?” inquired Charles. “Pray tell us about him.”\r\n\r\n“I was going to do so,” returned Mr. Mansfield, “in the hope that the\r\nhistory of his misfortunes might be a lesson to you, not to fall into the\r\nfault that has occasioned his ruin.\r\n\r\n“Maddox’s father rented a capital farm, a few miles from this village.\r\nHarry was a school-fellow of mine, so that in his childhood I saw a\r\ngreat deal of him. He had some good qualities. He always spoke the truth,\r\nand I don’t recollect that he ever did any thing spiteful, or injured\r\nanother purposely. His great fault was a habit of constant idleness. At\r\nplay-time, when the rest of the boys were amusing themselves at their\r\ndifferent sports, Maddox might always be found sitting on the stump of an\r\nold tree, that once overshadowed the playground; and all his employment\r\nwas to scratch up the earth with a stick. This was so constantly the\r\ncase, that the stump was called by the boys _Maddox’s seat_; and I have\r\nbeen told that it still goes by the same name; though, most likely, the\r\ncircumstance that gave rise to it has long been forgotten. You may\r\nsuppose that in school hours Harry did not gain much credit. He was\r\noftener in disgrace than any boy amongst us. He stood near the bottom\r\nof the lowest class, and I do not know that he ever made his way much\r\nhigher. Indeed, how should he? for all the time that he ought to have\r\nspent in learning his lessons, he passed in merely holding the book in\r\nhis hand, or twisting the corners of the leaves.”\r\n\r\n_Charles._ But I should have thought he would have been punished if he\r\ncould not say his lesson; and he would not like that, I suppose.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ Perhaps he did not like punishment; but he liked the\r\ntrouble of avoiding it still less. Indeed, after a smart caning, he would\r\nsometimes sit down to his book, and learn as much in half an hour as most\r\nof us could in a whole one. His being able to do so, as our good master\r\nused to say, made him so much the more inexcusable. “If, Maddox, you were\r\ndull by nature, and could not learn,” I remember his telling him one\r\nday, when the boy was crying, and begging not to be flogged, “I should\r\npity you; and, as long as you did your best, should never be angry: but\r\nyou have really a good understanding, and this idleness is unpardonable,\r\nand you need not hope to escape correction.” Correction, however, and\r\nencouragement, were equally thrown away upon Maddox; and he left school\r\nat fifteen, after having passed a miserable time, scolded by the masters\r\nand derided by the boys.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ What became of him then, grandpapa?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ His father took him home, intending to bring him up\r\nto farming: but he found he could make nothing of him; so he put him\r\napprentice to a brewer in a good way of business.\r\n\r\nHowever, Harry still continued idle, and learned nothing, so that when he\r\nwas out of his time, his master was very glad to get rid of so useless\r\na hand, and declared he would have nothing further to say to him;\r\nnotwithstanding he was then in want of a partner, and old Mr. Maddox,\r\nthe father, had offered to advance a considerable sum, if he would give\r\nhim a share of the business.\r\n\r\nSome time after this, he married; and his father then set him up in a\r\nbrewery by himself, and gave him all that was necessary to begin trade\r\nwith.\r\n\r\nHis success, however, was just what might have been expected. He did not\r\nlike to give himself trouble; and his beer was so bad, that nobody would\r\nbuy it. In short, he lost all his customers, and ran into debt; so that\r\nevery thing he had was taken away to pay his creditors.\r\n\r\nThe kind father once more received his son, with his wife and family,\r\ninto his own house; and instead of being angry, he tried to console him\r\nfor his misfortunes, by telling him, that as long as he had a shilling\r\nin the world he should share it with him; and that, by industry and\r\nfrugality, they might yet do very well. One would have thought that such\r\ngreat kindness, and the distresses he had brought upon himself, would\r\nhave had some effect on the mind of young Maddox; and indeed they had:\r\nfor a short time, he went on pretty well, but he soon relapsed into his\r\nformer habits of indolence. As long, however, as his father lived, he did\r\nnot know what it was to want. It is true, he was accustomed to lie in bed\r\ntill noon, and then to doze in an arm chair the greatest part of the day.\r\nBut his father was always up before the dawn, and continued to attend to\r\nthe concerns of his farm till after the sun was set; for he found that\r\nmuch additional industry was required, to enable him to support such\r\na large increase to his household. Harry at length lost his excellent\r\nparent, and had the misfortune, not long after, to bury his wife.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ Ah, poor Maddox! How badly off he must have been then,\r\ngrandpapa!\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ He was, indeed, my dear. All good management was at\r\nan end, both in the house and in the fields. He took no care of his\r\nchildren himself, nor did he provide any body to look after them for\r\nhim. His sons, in consequence of this neglect, grew up very wild young\r\nmen. They were always in company with the most worthless fellows in the\r\nneighbourhood; and at last one of them ran away to sea, and never was\r\nheard of more. The youngest girl fell into an ill state of health, and\r\nperished from want of care and nursing. The eldest daughter, mother to\r\nthe little Peggy whom you saw at the cottage, was the only one of the\r\nchildren that grew up to be a comfort to herself, or to her family. She\r\nmarried at a very early age, but, unfortunately for Peggy, died some time\r\nago.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ So poor Peggy has no mother! What a sad thing for her!\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ She has no father neither, my dear: but we will talk\r\nmore of her by and by, if I have not tired you with my long story.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ Oh, you need not be afraid of tiring us, grandpapa. We like to\r\nhear you very much, and I want to know how Maddox went on with his farm.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ Why, he left his farm to take care of itself; and when\r\nthe men went to him for directions, he used to tell them to begone about\r\ntheir business, and do as they would, for he should not trouble himself\r\nabout the matter. So perhaps one wanted to sow beans, when another wanted\r\nto sow corn; and then they would get into a quarrel, and not work at\r\nall. By this means, the seed was never put into his fields till after it\r\nhad begun to grow up in all the country round: and as he took no care\r\nto keep his land clean, it was always choked with weeds; and, in all\r\nthe time he was a farmer, he had not a single good crop. His fences too\r\nwere left in the most ruinous state, and his neighbour’s cattle used to\r\nget into his fields through the gaps in the hedges, and do much mischief\r\namong his corn and hay. Then sometimes his own beasts trespassed in the\r\nsame manner upon the grounds of other people, and he was obliged to pay\r\nfor the damage they did; and if they were sent to the pound, it was some\r\nexpense to him to redeem them.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ What do you mean, sir, by saying they were sent to the pound?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ A pound is a small spot inclosed with high rails, in\r\nwhich cattle that go astray may be confined; and the person whose office\r\nit is to keep the pound claims a certain fee when they are sent for by\r\nthe owner.\r\n\r\nMaddox’s farm belonged to Mr. Ashley; and when the lease was out, his\r\nlandlord refused to grant him another. From the time of the old man’s\r\ndeath, the rents had been very irregularly paid; and besides, Mr. Ashley\r\ndid not choose to let any part of his estate to a man who suffered it to\r\ngo to ruin.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ Indeed, I think he was in the right. I should not like to\r\nhave my fields, that might be kept in nice order, like yours, grandpapa,\r\nspoilt from want of proper care. But what became of Maddox, then?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ He hired a wretched cottage, and lived for some time\r\nupon the little money he had by him. When that was gone, he was actually\r\nreduced to beggary. He had scarcely a rag to cover him, and could\r\nbarely get food to keep him alive. I happened to hear of his miserable\r\nsituation, and I called on Mr. Ashley, to consult about what could be\r\ndone for him.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ And what did Mr. Ashley say?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ He said he was sorry to hear of his distress; and would\r\nbe glad to relieve him, if it were in his power. “But,” he added, “what\r\ncan I do? It is not proper to maintain a strong, hearty man, like\r\nMaddox, in idleness. He learned so little when he was young, that I know\r\nhe can hardly read or write; therefore, I cannot make him my steward.\r\nIf I hire him as a labourer, he will not do a day’s work in the year;\r\nand I am sure, for the pains he would take, my deer might all be lost,\r\nor stolen, if I made him deer-keeper.” Soon after this conversation,\r\nhowever, Mr. Ashley inclosed a part of his park, for keeping pheasants,\r\nand then he resolved to intrust the care of them to Harry Maddox, and\r\nordered that he should take little Peggy to live with him; for the poor\r\ngirl just before had had the misfortune to lose both her parents.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ Oh, you promised just now to tell us something about Peggy.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ I have only to say, that her character is the very\r\nreverse of her grandfather’s. She is a notable, active girl, and does a\r\nwonderful deal for her age. As Mr. Maddox still continues the same, the\r\nbirds would be sadly neglected, if it were not for her care. Mr. Ashley\r\nputs her to school, where she learns to work: and I believe she keeps\r\nboth her own and the old man’s clothes in very tolerable order. The\r\ncottage, too, is neat and clean, though there is no one to do any thing\r\nbut herself.\r\n\r\n“I thought she was a nice girl,” said Charles. “She was at work, you\r\nknow, Arthur, yesterday afternoon, when we went there.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Arthur, “and the old man was fast asleep. What a contrast\r\nbetween them!”\r\n\r\n“You see,” rejoined Mr. Mansfield, “though she is but a child, in how\r\nrespectable a light her industry makes her appear. She acquires the\r\nesteem of all who know her, and she has the satisfaction of feeling that\r\nshe does not live in vain. As for poor old Maddox, I don’t know from\r\nwhat source his satisfactions can arise. The review of his past life\r\ncan afford him no comfort; and if he looks forward to the close of his\r\npresent existence, he must be shocked at the account to which he will\r\nthen be called, for duties neglected, talents misemployed, and a family\r\nruined, through his want of care.”\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Well, I have often been told that I ought to be a good boy,\r\nand mind my lessons; but I did not know before, that idleness could lead\r\nto so much mischief. I always thought that, when I was a man, I should\r\nattend to my business as a matter of course.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ Ah, my dear child, you are much mistaken, if you suppose\r\nthat you will be able to get the better of your faults, only by growing\r\nolder. Now is the time for you to acquire good habits of all sorts; and\r\nif you neglect to do so, depend upon it, that when you become a man,\r\nyou will find the task only rendered a great deal more difficult, from\r\nhaving been so long delayed.\r\n\r\n“Very true, my dear,” said Mrs. Mansfield. “Besides, little folks should\r\nconsider, that it is not their future advantage alone which should lead\r\nthem to take pains with their studies—it is one of the absolute duties\r\nof their infant state. God Almighty did not mean that any of us should\r\nbe idle at any time; and a child who is idle when he ought to be at his\r\nbook, as much transgresses the will of God, as a man who neglects his\r\ntrade, or a woman who takes no care of her family.”\r\n\r\n“I think,” said Mr. Mansfield, starting up as he looked at his watch,\r\n“that whilst I have been prating away in favour of industry, I seem to\r\nhave forgotten that I have a thousand concerns to attend to. But I will\r\nno longer act in a way so contrary to my precepts. And so good morning to\r\nyou, I am off till dinner-time.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Page 127._\r\n\r\n_Chap. XIII._\r\n\r\n_A pleasant Ride._\r\n\r\n_London. Published by W. Darton Jun. Oct. 1815._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n_A pleasant Ride._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe story of Maddox had a very good effect upon the minds of the young\r\nBensons. They immediately brought out their books, and spent some time in\r\nreading and learning their lessons. Afterwards Mrs. Mansfield heard them\r\nthe catechism, and explained to them some parts of it which they did not\r\nclearly understand.\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Mansfield came in to dinner, he said that he should be obliged\r\nin the afternoon to go upon business to a place about ten miles off; and\r\nhe asked his wife, if she would like to accompany him in their one-horse\r\nchaise.\r\n\r\n“Thank you, my dear,” returned Mrs. Mansfield; “but it would give me more\r\npleasure if you would take the boys. I know they would enjoy a ride, and\r\nthey have been very good this morning.”\r\n\r\n“Have they so?” said the obliging grandpapa. “Why then, if you will give\r\nup your place, I will take them very willingly. I like the company of\r\ngood children.”\r\n\r\nThe party thus settled, dinner was quickly dispatched; the chaise stood\r\nready at the door, and the boys jumped into it with a look of pleasure on\r\ntheir countenances that can more easily be fancied than described.\r\n\r\nPart of the road they were to travel lay through a large forest. Here\r\nthey had an opportunity of seeing a variety of trees; and Mr. Mansfield\r\nanswered with the greatest readiness every question they put to him\r\nconcerning them.\r\n\r\n“What tree is that, grandpapa?” inquired Charles, pointing to one that\r\ngrew near the road; “the one, I mean, that has such an amazing large\r\ntrunk, and the branches of it spread so wide all round?”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ It is an oak, my dear; the most valuable timber tree\r\nthat grows.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ What are timber trees?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ Trees that are used in building houses and ships; they\r\nare principally oaks, elms, and ash-trees.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ And you say that the oak is the most valuable of them all; pray\r\nwhat makes it so?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ The wood is very hard, and tough; not apt to splinter,\r\nnor liable to be eaten by worms; and as it remains sound for a great\r\nwhile when under water, it answers very well for building ships, or for\r\npiles, or bridges; in short, for any thing that requires strength and\r\ndurability.\r\n\r\nThey now came to a part of the forest where many large oaks had been\r\nrecently felled. Leafless, and stript of all, but the stumps of the\r\nlarger branches, they lay at length upon the ground, and made a striking\r\ncontrast to the green and flourishing trees that grew around.\r\n\r\nCharles inquired, what made them look so white? Mr. Mansfield replied,\r\nthat they had been stript of their bark, or outer skin, which was used\r\nby the tanner, in the process of manufacturing leather. “Indeed,” added\r\nhe, “every part of the oak may be employed in tanning; the saw-dust, the\r\nleaves, all have a binding quality, that, in process of time, will harden\r\nthe raw hide of beasts into leather.”\r\n\r\n“Acorns grow upon oaks, don’t they, sir?” said Charles.\r\n\r\n“To be sure they do,” answered Arthur. “I have seen them in abundance\r\nsince we have been riding. Are they good to eat, grandpapa?”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ _You_ would find them bitter and disagreeable, but pigs\r\nand deer fatten upon them. Did you ever take notice of the cups?\r\n\r\nAs he said this, he broke off a bough from a tree which they were\r\npassing, and gave it to the boys to examine.\r\n\r\n“Would you suppose,” asked he, “that these large oaks, that cover so\r\nmuch ground, and form the glory of the forest, all sprung from acorns no\r\nlarger than these?”\r\n\r\n“It is very wonderful,” said Arthur. “Pray, sir, are they long growing?”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ An oak seldom comes to perfection in less than two\r\nhundred years, and they will sometimes live four or five hundred. Our\r\nEnglish oaks are particularly esteemed, but they are much fewer in\r\nnumber than they once were. In ancient times, before there were so\r\nmany inhabitants, and when cultivation was little attended to, almost\r\nthe whole island was but one forest. It has been cleared by degrees,\r\nhowever, and converted into corn and pasture land; and we have only now\r\na few forests of any size. In consequence of this, oak timber is much\r\nscarcer than it used to be. If you go into old houses, that were built\r\ntwo or three centuries ago, you will see nothing but oaken floors and\r\noaken wainscots. Now the case is altered, and people are obliged to be\r\ncontented with wood of a very inferior quality. Deal, for instance, is\r\nmuch used for the purposes I have mentioned.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ Are there any deal trees in this forest, grandpapa?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ There are no such things as deal trees, Charles. It is\r\nthe wood of the fir, which, when cut up into timber, is called deal. By\r\nand by, I will point out to you a plantation of firs, of which there\r\nare several different species. They are all ever-greens; that is, they\r\ndo not lose their leaves in winter. The Scotch fir is the most hardy,\r\nand thrives well on the bleak mountains of the north. It may likewise\r\nbe reckoned the most useful; for it supplies us with the best deal\r\nfor making masts of ships, floors, wainscots, tables, boxes, and other\r\nthings. The trunk and branches afford excellent pitch and tar. The roots,\r\nwhen divided into small splinters, are sometimes burnt by poor people\r\ninstead of candles. The outer bark is used, as well as that of the oak,\r\nin tanning leather; and I have heard that there is a place in Scotland\r\nwhere they make ropes of the inner bark; and that in some of the northern\r\ncountries of Europe, in times of scarcity, they grind it, and mix it with\r\ntheir flour when they make bread.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ I see another large tree, grandpapa, but it does not look like\r\nthe oak.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ ’Tis a beech, a very useful tree to the cabinet-maker.\r\nIts branches, you observe, slope gently downwards, instead of growing\r\nstraight out, and it is more full of leaf than the oak. That tree on the\r\nleft is an ash. Its foliage is very light. The wood is much used for\r\nmaking implements of husbandry, particularly hop-poles.\r\n\r\n“And _there_ is a fine stately tree!” observed Charles; “is it another\r\nbeech?”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ No, Charles, that is an elm; a timber tree of great\r\nvalue. You may often see them in hedgerows, and they are frequently\r\nplanted in rows to make avenues in parks. The inner part of the wood\r\nis almost as solid and heavy as iron; and is therefore much used in\r\nmill-work, and to make axle-trees, keels of boats, chairs, and coffins.\r\n\r\n“Pray, pray,” interrupted Arthur, “look at that tree a little way off,\r\nhow the leaves flutter with the wind! They are in constant motion; but\r\nyet it is very calm, and all the other trees are still.”\r\n\r\n“That tree,” replied Mr. Mansfield, “is called an aspen, or trembling\r\npoplar. It is the nature of it to be in that constant agitation, whether\r\nthe wind is high or not.”\r\n\r\n“What is done with the aspen?” inquired Charles.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ The stem is bored for water-pipes, and is made into\r\nmilk-pails, clogs, and pattens.\r\n\r\nThe business which Mr. Mansfield had to transact, detained them so long\r\nthat it grew very dark as they were returning home; and the little boys\r\nwere surprised, in the midst of the gloom, to see a bright shining speck\r\nupon the ground. “What is that, what is that, grandpapa?” they exclaimed\r\nat the same instant. “It looks,” added Charles, “as if one of the stars\r\nhad fallen to the earth.” “And I see another, and another,” said Arthur,\r\nlaughing: “oh, what can they be?”\r\n\r\n“They are glow-worms,” replied Mr. Mansfield; “and you may find numbers\r\nof them, after dark, at this time of the year.”\r\n\r\n“They are very pretty,” said Arthur. “I should like to see one near.\r\nWill you be so kind, sir, as to stop for a moment, and let me get out and\r\nfetch one?”\r\n\r\nMr. Mansfield consented, and Arthur jumped out, and presently returned\r\nin triumph with his prize. They then saw that the glow-worm was a small\r\ninsect, something bigger than a wood-louse; and that the brightness\r\nproceeded from a part under the tail. The light it gave was strong enough\r\nfor them to see what time it was by their grandfather’s watch, when held\r\nclose to it.\r\n\r\n“I have been trying, grandpapa,” said Arthur, after having sat still for\r\nsome time, with the glow-worm in his hand, “to find what it is that\r\noccasions the light; but I cannot make it out.”\r\n\r\n“I believe, Arthur,” said Mr. Mansfield, smiling, “that this wonderful\r\nlittle insect has puzzled philosophers much wiser than you. I never heard\r\nits luminous appearance explained in a very satisfactory manner; and not\r\nat all in a way that _you_ would understand.”\r\n\r\n_Charles._ There is no difficulty in finding out glow-worms, let it be\r\never so dark.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ Your observation, my dear, brings to my mind a pretty\r\nfable I once read about a glow-worm; and the moral of it is, that we\r\nought not to boast of any external advantages we may possess, or despise\r\nthose who happen to be without them; since the very things we are proud\r\nof, often bring down misfortunes upon us.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ But what was the fable, grandpapa? In my book they always put\r\nthe fable first; but you have begun with the moral.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ “A glow-worm, vain of her beauty, began to upbraid a\r\npoor humble wood-louse, that lay beside her. ‘Dost not thou admire my\r\nsplendid tail,’ said she, ‘that sends forth a light almost as glorious as\r\nthe stars? Insignificant reptile that _thou_ art! wonder at thy boldness,\r\nin venturing so near to one of my brilliant appearance. What admiration\r\nwilt _thou_ acquire, or when wilt _thou_ become the pride and glory of\r\nthe night?’\r\n\r\n“The wood-louse replied with great humility, ‘Happy in myself, I do not\r\nwish to draw the attention of others; and if I have not thy beauty to\r\nboast of, I am at least without thy pride.’\r\n\r\n“A nightingale, who was singing in a neighbouring bush, attracted by\r\nthe light of the glow-worm, flew to the spot where she lay, and seizing\r\nthe vain insect in her beak, carried it away to feast her family. The\r\nwood-louse, concealed in darkness, escaped the enemy’s notice.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n_Bees._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, on the little boys getting up, they were surprised at\r\nhearing a tinkling sound just under their windows. They were induced, as\r\nsoon as they were ready, to run down into the garden, to see what was\r\ngoing forward.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mansfield was the person who occasioned the noise, by striking the\r\nlid of a tin saucepan with a large key.\r\n\r\n“Oh, grandmamma, what are you about?” exclaimed Arthur, laughing. “I\r\nshould have taken you for my little sister Kate, amusing herself by\r\nmaking, what she would call, a _pretty noise_.”\r\n\r\n“I do it, my dear, to prevent the bees from going away,” replied Mrs.\r\nMansfield. “Don’t you see what swarms are flying about?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” returned Arthur. “But what have they to do with the key and the\r\nsaucepan lid?”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Page 142._\r\n\r\n_Chap. XIV._\r\n\r\n_The Bees._\r\n\r\n_London. Published by W. Darton Junʳ. Oct. 1ˢᵗ. 1815._]\r\n\r\n“All these,” said Mrs. Mansfield, “are young bees, that have been hatched\r\nthis summer; and now that they are grown up, the hive is too small to\r\ncontain them. They therefore have left it; and are going to seek another\r\nplace for themselves; and it is generally supposed that a tinkling noise\r\nwill keep them from going to a distance; though, whether it has any\r\neffect or not, I cannot pretend to determine.”\r\n\r\nBy this time the bees had settled in a cluster on the branch of a tree,\r\nwhere they all hung together in one great mass. Old Ralph then took an\r\nempty hive, and shook them into it, having previously covered his hands\r\nand face, that he might not be stung.\r\n\r\n“How do bees make honey, grandmamma?” inquired Charles.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Mansfield._ By means of their long trunks they suck up the\r\nsweetness that is in the cups of flowers.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ And is that honey?\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Mansfield._ Not until it has been further prepared by the bees,\r\nwho swallow it, and then throw it up again, after having digested it in\r\ntheir stomachs.\r\n\r\n_Charles._ Bees make wax too, do not they?\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Mansfield._ Yes: come to this bed of flowers, and you will see them\r\nat work.\r\n\r\n“I observe,” said Arthur, after having watched them attentively for some\r\ntime, “that they every moment stroke their legs over one another; is that\r\nof any use?”\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Mansfield._ It is in order to put the yellow dust, which they\r\ncollect from the flowers, and of which the wax is made, upon their hinder\r\nthighs: a few short hairs on them form a kind of basket, on purpose to\r\nreceive it. When they have collected as much as they can carry, they fly\r\nback to the hive to deposit it there.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ And what use do they make of it, grandmamma?\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Mansfield._ After having kneaded and properly prepared it, they\r\nmake it into the honey-comb, or little cells which contain the honey; and\r\nwhen the cells are full, the bees stop them up with a little more wax, to\r\npreserve it as food for the winter.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Then how do we get it?\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Mansfield._ The hive is held over brimstone, which kills the bees,\r\nand then we take out the honey-combs. Some people adopt a method of\r\ntaking the honey without destroying the bees; but I do not know whether\r\nthat is less cruel in the end; for the poor things are then frequently\r\nstarved in the winter, for want of their proper food.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Have not I heard something about a queen-bee?\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Mansfield._ Very probably you have. There is a queen to every\r\nhive; and she is larger than the rest. She very seldom comes abroad, and\r\nwhenever she does, she is attended by a number of her subjects. They are\r\nso much attached to her, that, if she dies, they make a mournful humming,\r\nand unless another queen be given to them, will at last pine away, and\r\ndie too.\r\n\r\n“How very surprising!” said Charles. “Who would have thought that such\r\nlittle insects could show so much attachment to each other?”\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Mansfield._ The natural history of the bee is full of wonders, my\r\ndear. Besides the queen, there are two different sorts, the drones and\r\nthe working bees.\r\n\r\nThe drones seldom leave the hive, and never assist to procure honey. When\r\nthe time comes for making up their winter stores, they are, therefore,\r\nall killed by the working bees as useless members of society. As they are\r\nwithout stings, they are unable to defend themselves. The working bees\r\ncompose the most numerous body of the state. They have the care of the\r\nhive, collect wax and honey from the flowers, make the wax into combs,\r\nfeed the young, keep the hive clean, turn out all strangers, and employ\r\nthemselves in promoting the general good.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ They are very industrious, indeed, Charles! Do you recollect\r\nDr. Watts’s little hymn about the Busy Bee?\r\n\r\n_Charles._ Yes, brother; I was just thinking of it.\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Mansfield._ Repeat it then will you, my love? After the account I\r\nhave been giving you, we shall attend to it with particular pleasure.\r\n\r\n    _Charles._ How doth the little busy bee\r\n                 Improve each shining hour!\r\n               And gather honey all the day\r\n                 From every opening flower!\r\n\r\n               How skilfully she builds her cell!\r\n                 How neat she spreads the wax!\r\n               And labours hard to store it well\r\n                 With the sweet food she makes!\r\n\r\n               In work of labour, or of skill,\r\n                 I would be busy too;\r\n               For Satan finds some mischief still\r\n                 For idle hands to do.\r\n\r\n               In books, or work, or healthful play,\r\n                 Let my first years be past;\r\n               That I may give, for every day,\r\n                 A good account at last.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n_An Evening Stroll._\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the weather was remarkably pleasant, Mrs. Mansfield proposed having\r\ntea earlier than usual, that they might afterwards have time for a walk;\r\nand the rest of the party approving the scheme, they set off in high\r\nspirits, the moment that meal was concluded. Mrs. Mansfield was not a\r\nvery good walker, but she leaned upon her husband’s arm, and enjoyed\r\nthe fineness of the evening. It was not their intention to go to any\r\ngreat distance from home; so when they came to a stile, or the stump of\r\na tree, she sat down to rest herself, and take a view of the country;\r\nduring which time, the little boys amused themselves by running backwards\r\nand forwards, and would frequently pick up some flower or curious little\r\npebble, and bring it to their grandpapa, to inquire its name and use. As\r\nthey were proceeding gently by the side of a large pond, they saw a great\r\nnumber of birds skimming over the surface in all directions. In answer to\r\nArthur’s inquiries, Mr. Mansfield replied that they were swallows, and\r\nthat they were flying about in quest of food.\r\n\r\n“What food,” asked Charles, “can they possibly expect to find growing\r\nupon the pond?”\r\n\r\n“Flies and insects,” answered his grandfather, “are the proper food for\r\nswallows; and many of them constantly sport on the water.”\r\n\r\n“And swallows,” said Mrs. Mansfield, “are thought to be of great use, by\r\ndestroying so many millions of them, which would otherwise multiply so\r\nfast, as to be quite a nuisance to the world.”\r\n\r\n_Charles._ Can they catch them as they fly?\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Mansfield._ Yes, my dear. Their mouths are made large that they\r\nmay take in their prey the more easily; and indeed, every part of the\r\nswallow is wonderfully adapted to its nature and manner of living.\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ How do you mean, grandmamma?\r\n\r\n_Mrs. Mansfield._ As in pursuit of insects it is necessary for them to\r\nbe almost constantly on the wing, their bodies are very light and small;\r\nand the wings being long in proportion, they fly with great ease and\r\nswiftness. This is more particularly needful to them, because they are\r\nbirds of passage; that is, they go to different countries according to\r\nthe season of the year. They come over here in large flocks about the\r\nmiddle of April; and in October they assemble again in great numbers, and\r\nfly across the sea to some warmer climate. They make their nests with\r\nclay, and line them with feathers and soft grass, and build them chiefly\r\na little way down the tops of chimneys, or under the eaves of houses. As\r\nthey have little occasion to be upon the ground, their legs are short and\r\nill adapted for walking.\r\n\r\n“Your observation, my dear,” said Mr. Mansfield, “that swallows are\r\nformed in the best manner possible for their habits of life, is perfectly\r\njust; but it should not be confined to them. The God of Nature has\r\nequally adapted every other kind of bird, and, I may add, every animal,\r\nto the state for which he designed it.”\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ Has he, indeed, grandpapa! I wish you would tell me about them,\r\nthen. I should like you should give me an account of every creature that\r\nlives.\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ Oh, my dear! I am much too ignorant of Natural History\r\nto be able to do that. Indeed, I know very little of it; but the more\r\nI read and the more I observe, the greater reason I see to admire the\r\nwonderful goodness and wisdom of the Almighty.\r\n\r\nAt this instant, Charles, who had been running to a little distance,\r\nreturned with great speed, bringing with him, by the hinder leg, a dead\r\nanimal he had picked up, rather smaller than a common rat, but broader in\r\nproportion to its length.\r\n\r\n“What is this, what is this?” asked he.\r\n\r\n“A mole,” replied Mrs. Mansfield, who saw it first.\r\n\r\n“A mole!” repeated her husband: “Oh, bring it to us, then. This little\r\nanimal, Arthur, will serve as an instance of what I was saying; for no\r\ncreature can be more exactly suited to its mode of life.”\r\n\r\n“How, sir?” inquired Arthur.\r\n\r\n“In the first place,” returned Mr. Mansfield, “you should be informed\r\nthat the mole lives almost constantly under ground; as its food consists\r\nof worms and little insects that it finds in the earth. It is therefore\r\nnecessary for it to be able to work its way through the earth; and if you\r\nexamine it well, you will find it admirably constructed for that purpose.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed,” said Arthur, “_I_ see nothing very particular in it.”\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ Look at its fore-feet. They are broad, strong, and\r\nshort; not set straight from the body, but inclining a little sideways.\r\nBy means of this position, it is enabled, as it burrows its way, to cast\r\noff the mould on each side, so as to make for itself a hollow passage in\r\nthe middle. Their breadth likewise serves the purpose of hands, to form\r\ntheir nests, scoop out the earth, and seize their prey. The form of the\r\nbody is equally well contrived. The fore part is thick and strong, so\r\nthat it can dig its way with wonderful quickness, either to pursue its\r\nprey or to escape from its enemies; whilst the hinder parts being small\r\nand taper, enable it to pass easily through the loose earth that the\r\nfore-feet had flung behind.\r\n\r\n“It is of a clean black colour,” said Charles; “and the hair is short,\r\nthick, and very soft.”\r\n\r\n“True,” said Mr. Mansfield. “And the skin is so tough that it would\r\nrequire a sharp knife to cut it. It is not therefore liable to be injured\r\nby flints, or other stones that it may meet with in its passage under\r\nground. Now let me see which of you can find its eyes.”\r\n\r\n_Charles._ The eyes, the eyes! grandpapa, this mole must be without eyes!\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ I would find them if I could, but it certainly has none.\r\n\r\nMr. Mansfield parted the hair, and pointed out two very small specks.\r\n“The smallness of the eyes,” said he, “is to this animal a peculiar\r\nhappiness. Had they been larger, they would have been liable to frequent\r\ninjuries, from the mould falling into them; and of what use would they be\r\nto him, when destined to pass his whole life where no light could reach\r\nhim?”\r\n\r\n_Arthur._ But then, sir, how do they see to get their food?\r\n\r\n_Mr. Mansfield._ They do _not see_ it, Arthur; they find it out by their\r\nsmell, which as well as their hearing is very acute: so that, though\r\nnearly blind, they are not without the means of providing for their\r\nsupport, and of knowing how to avoid danger. The eye is, therefore,\r\nmerely given them to let them know that they are out of the way when\r\nthey see the light. The mole shows great art in skinning worms, which it\r\nalways does before it eats them; stripping the skin from end to end,\r\nand squeezing out all the contents of the body. During summer they run\r\nin search of snails and worms, in the night-time, among the grass; which\r\noften makes them the prey of owls. Moles do a good deal of mischief in\r\nfields and gardens; because, by running under the earth, they loosen the\r\nroots of plants and corn. But yet they are of use, as every thing living\r\nis, in the grand system of Nature: their prey would without them so\r\nmultiply, that they themselves would commit greater mischief than we fear\r\nfrom moles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n_The Return Home._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next day was the day appointed for the young Bensons to return home.\r\nThey rose earlier than usual, that they might have time to walk round the\r\nfarm, and take a last look at the objects that had given them so much\r\npleasure. They first went to the poultry-yard, and took with them some\r\ntares, to feed a pigeon that was grown so tame as to fly down when he saw\r\nthem, and perch upon their heads. Their next business was to take leave\r\nof Plover the pony, for whom they had both conceived a great affection;\r\nfor, after Charles’s fright, Mr. Mansfield had given them several lessons\r\nin riding, and they had learned to manage him tolerably well, and were\r\nexceedingly delighted with the exercise.\r\n\r\nThey were stroking him, and lamenting that they should have no more\r\nrides, when old Ralph came up.\r\n\r\nHonest Ralph was much attached to his master, and was disposed to love\r\nhis grandchildren for his sake; and their constant civility and good\r\nhumour conspired to make them favourites.\r\n\r\nAs he had heard what they said, he very obligingly brought out the\r\nsaddle and bridle; and, harnessing the pony, told them that breakfast was\r\nnot yet ready, and that they should have a ride the last morning.\r\n\r\nThese words “the last morning” brought the tears into Charles’s eyes;\r\nbut as he had a good deal of fortitude, he strove to suppress them, and,\r\nmounting Plover, galloped away to a distance, that he might not be seen\r\nto cry. Presently after Arthur took his turn, and, as it grew late, they\r\nthen went in doors.\r\n\r\nThey found Mr. and Mrs. Mansfield in the parlour, and the post-chaise,\r\nin which they were to set off, already at the door. They were therefore\r\nobliged to hurry over their breakfast, that they might not keep their\r\ngrandfather waiting for them; for the old gentleman had engaged to\r\naccompany his grandsons to London, where he was to remain for a few days.\r\nMrs. Mansfield kissed both the boys over and over again, and charged them\r\nto give her love to their papa and mamma, and little sister. She bestowed\r\nupon them great commendations for their good conduct and docility during\r\nthe whole of their stay, and told them that, as they had enjoyed their\r\nvisit, she hoped they would repeat it at some future opportunity.\r\n\r\nArthur and Charles pressed her hand, and returned her embraces; but their\r\nvoices failed when they attempted to thank her for the great kindness she\r\nhad shown them.\r\n\r\nAt length the moment of separation came; but before they stepped into the\r\nchaise, they went round to shake hands with all the servants, who had\r\nassembled about the door, in order to see them set off, and wish them\r\ngood-bye.\r\n\r\nWhen the carriage drove off, a gloom hung for a short time upon the\r\ncountenances of the young travellers; but it cleared away by degrees, as\r\ntheir attention was diverted to new objects, and in a short time they\r\nentirely recovered their gaiety.\r\n\r\nAfter they had travelled some miles, Mr. Mansfield informed them that\r\nthey were then upon a new road, which a few years before had been cut\r\nthrough a steep hill. “You observe,” said he, “that we have a high bank\r\non each side of us, so that we seem to be almost buried between the two.\r\nThe spot where we now are was formerly level with the top of the banks,\r\nand made a part of the same field with them; and the old road then went\r\nseveral miles further about, to avoid this hill. But now that the ground\r\nhas been cut away so as to leave the road on a gentle ascent, coming this\r\nway saves time, and is less fatiguing to horses.”\r\n\r\n“It must have been a work of great labour,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Certainly,” returned Mr. Mansfield; “but it is nothing in comparison to\r\nsome works that have been accomplished. What should you think of making\r\ncanals, or artificial rivers, for forty or fifty miles together, where\r\nbefore was dry land?”\r\n\r\n“Is it possible,” said Charles, “that that should ever have been done!”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly, my dear, in several places,” observed Mr. Mansfield. “When\r\na number of men, Charles, unite together in the same work, with prudence\r\nand industry, it is difficult to say what they _cannot_ do.”\r\n\r\nThe travellers did not arrive in London till late in the evening. Arthur\r\nand Charles rejoiced to meet again their dear parents and sister, from\r\nwhom they had never before separated; and they felt, that though they\r\nmight enjoy an occasional excursion, yet for a constancy no place was so\r\nhappy or desirable as HOME.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.\r\n\r\n_London: William Darton, 58, Holborn-Hill._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHILDREN’S BOOKS\r\n\r\n                               PUBLISHED BY\r\n                             WILLIAM DARTON,\r\n                        58, Holborn-hill, London.\r\n\r\n\r\n1.
