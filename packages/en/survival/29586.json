As\r\nboth pictures are compared there appears to be very little in common\r\nbetween them, the white fluffy feathery masses contained in the pods\r\nshown in the one picture, standing in strange contrast to the strong,\r\nbeautifully regular and even threads wound on the bobbins pictured in\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nFrom cotton tree to cotton thread is undoubtedly a far cry, but it will\r\nbe seen further on that the connection between the two is a very real\r\nand vital one.\r\n\r\nNow it is the main purpose of this book to unfold the wonderful story of\r\nthe plant, and to fill in the details of the gap from tree to thread,\r\nand to trace the many changes through which the beautiful downy cotton\r\nwool passes before it arrives in the prim looking state of thread ready\r\nalike for the sewing machine or the needle of a seamstress.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 2.--Bobbins of cotton thread.\r\n\r\nRemembering that the great majority of the readers of this little book\r\nmust of necessity be quite unaccustomed to trade terms and technical\r\nexpressions, the author has endeavoured to present to his readers in\r\nuntechnical language a simple yet truthful account of the many\r\noperations and conditions through which cotton is made to pass before\r\nreaching the final stages.\r\n\r\nNature provides no lovelier sight than the newly opened capsules\r\ncontaining the pure white and creamy flocculent masses of the cotton\r\nfibre as they hang from almost every branch of the tree at the end of a\r\nfavourable season.\r\n\r\nAnd how strange is the story of this plant as we look back through the\r\ncenturies and listen to the myths and fables, almost legion, which early\r\nhistorians have handed down to us or imaginative travellers have\r\nconceived. There is, however, every reason to believe that in the far\r\ndistant ages of antiquity this plant was cultivated, and yielded then,\r\nas it does now, a fibre from which the inhabitants of those far-off\r\ntimes produced material with which to clothe their bodies.\r\n\r\nIt will not be considered out of place if some of the early beliefs\r\nwhich obtained among the peoples of Western Asia and Europe for many\r\nyears are related.\r\n\r\nLike many other things the origin of the Cotton plant is shrouded in\r\nmystery, and many writers are agreed that it originally came from the\r\nEast, but it will be seen later on that equally strong claims can be\r\npresented from other countries in the Western Hemisphere. Many of us\r\nhave been amused at the curious ideas which people, say of a hundred\r\nyears ago, had of the Coral Polyp.\r\n\r\nEven to-day children may be heard singing in school,\r\n\r\n  \"Far adown the silent ocean\r\n  Dwells the coral _insect_ small\"!\r\n\r\n\r\nNot a few of the early naturalists believed that the Coral was a plant\r\nand while living in the sea water it was soft, and when dead it became\r\nhard!\r\n\r\nWe smile at this, of course, but it was not until actual investigation\r\non the spot, as to what the Coral was, that the truth came out.\r\n\r\nIt was then discovered to be an animal and not a plant, and that during\r\nlife its hard limy skeleton was covered by soft muscular tissue, which,\r\nwhen decomposing, was readily washed away by the sea, leaving the hard\r\ninterior exposed as coral.\r\n\r\nWhen the absurd beliefs are read which found credence among all classes\r\nof the people during the middle ages, and down even to the end of the\r\nseventeenth century, as to what the cotton boll or pod was, the reader\r\nis inclined to rub his eyes and think surely he must be reading \"Baron\r\nMunchausen\" over again, for a nearer approach to the wonderful\r\nstatements of that former-fabled traveller it would be difficult to find\r\nthan the simple crude conceptions which prevailed of the growth, habits,\r\nand physical characteristics of the Cotton plant.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the early myths and fables of the plant in question has\r\nbeen very fully treated by the late Mr. Henry Lee, F. L. S., who was for\r\na time at the Brighton Aquarium. His book, the \"Vegetable Lamb of\r\nTartary,\" shows indefatigable research for a correct explanation of the\r\nmyth, and after a strictly impartial inquiry he comes to the conclusion\r\nthat all the various phases which these fabulous concoctions assumed,\r\nhad their beginnings in nothing more or less than the simple mature pod\r\nof the Cotton plant.\r\n\r\nIt will not be necessary to consider here more than one or two of these\r\nvery curious beliefs about cotton. By some it was supposed that in a\r\ncountry which went by the name \"The Tartars of the East,\" there grew a\r\nwonderful tree which yielded buds still more wonderful. These, when\r\nripe, were said to burst and expose to view tiny lambs whose fleeces\r\ngave a pure white wool which the natives made into different garments.\r\n\r\nBy and by, a delightfully curious change took place, and it is found\r\nthat the fruit which was formerly said to have the little lamb within,\r\nwas now changed into a live lamb attached to the top of the plant. Mr.\r\nLee says: \"The stem or stalk on which the lamb was suspended above the\r\nground, was sufficiently flexible to allow the animal to bend downward,\r\nand browse on the herbage within its reach. When all the grass within\r\nthe length of its tether had been consumed, the stem withered and the\r\nplant died. This plant lamb was reported to have bones, blood, and\r\ndelicate flesh, and to be a favourite food of wolves, though no other\r\ncarnivorous animal would attack it.\"\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 3.--The vegetable lamb of Tartary.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 3 is shown Joannes Zahn's idea of what this wonderful \"Barometz\r\nor Tartarian lamb\" was like. Now, mainly through an imaginative\r\nEnglishman named Sir John Mandeville, who lived in the reign of Edward\r\nIII., did this latter form of the story find its way into England.\r\n\r\nThis illustrious traveller left his native country in 1322, and for over\r\nthirty years traversed the principal countries of Europe and Asia. When\r\nhe came home he commenced to write a history of his remarkable travels.\r\nIn these are found references to the Cotton plant, and so curious an\r\naccount does he give of it, that it has been considered worth\r\nreproduction in his own words: \"And there growethe a maner of Fruyt, as\r\nthough it weren Gourdes: and whan ther been rype men kutten hem ato, and\r\nmen fynden with inne a lyttle Best, in Flesche, in Bon and Blode, as\r\nthough it were a lytylle Lomb with outen Wolle. And men eten both the\r\nFrut and the Best; and that is a great Marveylle. Of that Frute I have\r\neaten; alle thoughe it were wondirfulle, but that I knowe well that God\r\nis Marveyllous in his Werkes.\"\r\n\r\nNo wonder that many accepted his account of the \"Vegetable Lamb\" without\r\nquestion. When a nobleman of the reputation of Sir J. Mandeville stated\r\nthat he had actually eaten of the fruit of the Cotton, was there any\r\nneed for further doubt?\r\n\r\nIt appears, however, that contemporary with Mandeville was another\r\ntraveller, an Italian Friar, named Odoricus, who also had travelled in\r\nAsia and heard of the plant which yielded cotton. He, too, fell a prey\r\nto the lamb theory. Many other writers and travellers followed, all more\r\nor less believing in the plant animal theory. However, in 1641, Kircher\r\nof Avignon in describing cotton declared it to be a plant. And so the\r\nstory for years passed through many changes. First one would assert what\r\nhe considered to be the right solution, and this was immediately\r\nchallenged by the next investigator, so that assertion and contradiction\r\nfollowed each other in quick succession.\r\n\r\nIn 1725, however, a German doctor named Breyn communicated with the\r\nRoyal Society on the subject of the \"Vegetable lamb,\" emphatically\r\nstating the story to be nothing more or less than a fable. He very\r\nnaïvely remarked that \"the work and productions of nature should be\r\ndiscovered, not invented,\" and he threw doubts as to whether those who\r\nhad written about the mythical lamb had ever seen one.\r\n\r\nWhen the writings and dissertations of Mandeville, Odoricus and others\r\nare carefully considered, these conclusions force themselves upon us:\r\nthat direct personal observation must have played a very minor part in\r\nthe attempt to get at the truth in connection with the origin and growth\r\nof the Cotton plant.\r\n\r\nTheir statements stand in very sharp contrast with those of writers who\r\nlived before the Christian era commenced. Of these, mention must be made\r\nof Herodotus, surnamed the _Father of History_.\r\n\r\nThis celebrated Greek historian and philosopher was born, B.C. 484, in\r\nHalicarnassus in Greece. In his book of travels he speaks of the Cotton\r\nplant. It appears, mainly owing to the tyrannical government of\r\nLygdamis, he left his native land and travelled in many countries in\r\nEurope, Asia, and Africa. He appears to have at least determined, that\r\nhe would only write of those things of which he had intimate knowledge,\r\nand would under no circumstances take for granted what he could not by\r\npersonal observation verify for himself. In speaking of India and the\r\nCotton plant, he says: \"The wild trees in that country bear for their\r\nfruit fleeces surpassing those of sheep in beauty and excellence, and\r\nthe natives clothe themselves in cloths made therefrom.\" In another\r\nplace he refers to a present which was sent by one of the kings of\r\nEgypt, which was padded with cotton. He also describes a machine for\r\nseparating the seed from the fibre or lint. Compared with our modern\r\ngins, as they are called, this machine was exceedingly primitive and\r\nsimple in construction.\r\n\r\nThere is not the slightest doubt that the first reliable information of\r\nthe physical characters of the fibre and its uses was conveyed into\r\nEurope by the officers of the Emperor Alexander. One of his greatest\r\nAdmirals, named Nearchus, observed the growth of cotton in India, and\r\nthe use to which it was put, especially the making of sheets, shirts and\r\nturbans.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one of the most careful observers that lived before the\r\nChristian era commenced, was Theophrastus, who wrote some strikingly\r\ncorrect things about the Cotton plant of India three centuries before\r\nChrist!\r\n\r\nIn describing the tree he said it was useful in producing cotton which\r\nthe Indians wove into garments, that it was not unlike the dog rose, and\r\nthat the leaves were somewhat like the leaves of the mulberry tree. The\r\ncultivation of the plant was also very correctly noted as to the rows in\r\nwhich the cotton seeds were placed, and as to the distances to which\r\nthese rows were set. According to Dr. Royle, however, reference is made\r\nto cotton in the \"Sacred Institutes of Manu\" so frequently that the\r\nconclusion is admitted that cotton must have been in frequent use in\r\nIndia at that time, which was 800 B.C.\r\n\r\nAs was to be expected, Persia very early had cottons and calicoes\r\nimported from India. In the sixth verse of the first chapter of Esther\r\ndefinite reference is made to the use to which cotton was put at the\r\nfeasts which King Ahasuerus gave about 519 B.C. \"White, green, and blue\r\nhangings\" are said to have been used on this occasion, and from\r\nauthorities who have specially investigated this subject, we are told\r\nthat the hangings mentioned were simply white and blue striped cottons.\r\nThis would also confirm the statement that dyeing is one of the oldest\r\nindustries we have.\r\n\r\nIt appears that the Greeks and Romans in good time learned to value\r\ngoods made of cotton, and soon followed the Oriental custom of erecting\r\nawnings or coverings for protection from the sun's rays. The Emperor\r\nCæsar is said to have constructed a huge screen extending from his own\r\nresidence along the Sacred Way to the top of the Capitoline Hill. The\r\nwhole of the Roman Forum was also covered in by him in a similar way.\r\nCoverings for tents, sail cloth made from cotton, and fancy coverlets\r\nwere also in use among the people of these stirring times.\r\n\r\nAnd now comes the important question: Was cotton indigenous to India in\r\nthese very early times? and was it carried and afterwards planted in\r\nEgypt, Africa, and America?\r\n\r\nAs an attempt is made to successfully answer this question, our minds\r\nare thrown back to the time when Christopher Columbus, a Genoese, having\r\nheard of India, desired to find a new way to that country. Comparatively\r\npoor himself, he was unable to equip an expedition, and laid his scheme\r\nbefore the Council of Genoa. They declined to have anything to do with\r\nit, and he is found next presenting his case to the King of Portugal.\r\nHere he alike failed, and he ultimately applied to the King and Queen of\r\nSpain, when he met with success.\r\n\r\nThe 3rd of August, 1492, found him fully equipped with two ships, and on\r\nhis way west to find a new way to India. He first touched the Bahamas\r\nthirty days after setting sail from Europe, and to his astonishment he\r\nwas met by the natives, who came out to meet him in canoes, bringing\r\nwith them cotton yarn and thread for the purpose of barter. In Cuba he\r\nwas surprised to find hammocks made from cotton cord in very general\r\nuse. What Columbus observed in the West Indies as to the growth and\r\nmanufacture of cotton, was found afterwards to be by no means confined\r\nto these islands, but that in South and Central America the natives were\r\nquite accustomed both to the growth and manufacture of cotton.\r\n\r\nIndisputable evidence can be presented to prove that the ancient\r\ncivilisations of Mexico, Peru, and Central America, were well acquainted\r\nwith cotton. When Peru was subjugated in 1522 by Pizarro, the\r\nmanufacture of cotton was in a flourishing condition.\r\n\r\nSimilarly when Mexico fell into the hands of Cortez in 1519, he too\r\nfound that the use of cotton was very general. So delighted was he at\r\nwhat he saw of the quality and beauty of their manufactured goods, that\r\nhe had no hesitation in dispatching to Europe a present consisting of\r\nmantles, to the Emperor Charles V.\r\n\r\nFive years after Columbus started on his momentous voyage, another\r\nexpedition under Vasco da Gama set out from the Tagus to make the voyage\r\nto India by the way of the Cape of Good Hope.\r\n\r\nImmediately Gama had safely reached India, there were others who quickly\r\ndesired to follow, and in 1516 another adventurous Spaniard on his way\r\nto India called at S. Africa, and found the natives wearing garments\r\nmade of cotton.\r\n\r\nThere is therefore no reason to question the statement which has\r\nrepeatedly been made, that at least three centres are known in which the\r\nCotton plant from very early times has been indigenous, and that the\r\npeoples of these countries were well acquainted with the property and\r\nuses of the cotton wool obtained from the plant. An average of more than\r\n1,000,000 bales, each weighing 500 lbs., are exported from Egypt every\r\nyear, and the question has been raised whether the cultivation of the\r\nplant in Egypt can be said to date far back. This is not so. The fibre\r\nalmost exclusively used by the ancient Egyptians was flax, and the\r\nnature of the garments covering the mummies of the ancient Egyptians has\r\nbeen satisfactorily decided by the microscope. It is very probable that\r\nthe cultivation of the plant at the beginning of the thirteenth century\r\nwas carried on purely for the purpose of ornamental gardening, and even\r\nwhen the seventeenth century was fairly well advanced, the Egyptians\r\nstill imported cotton.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century, however, has seen important developments in the\r\ncultivation of cotton in Egypt, and now the position attained by this\r\ncountry is only outdistanced by the United States and India.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Botany of Cotton.=--Botanists tell us that the vegetable kingdom is\r\nprimarily divided into three great classes--viz., (1) Dicotyledons; (2)\r\nMonocotyledons; and (3) Acotyledons.\r\n\r\nNow these names solely refer to the nature and form of the seeds\r\nproduced by the plants, and by the first it is understood that a single\r\nseed is divisible into two seed lobes in developing. In the case of the\r\nsecond, the seed is formed only of one lobe, and in the third the seed\r\nis wanting as a cotyledon, but the method of propagation is carried on\r\nby what are called spores. We have examples of the last-named class in\r\nthe ferns, lycopods and horsetail plants. The first two of the\r\nabove-named classes have been well called Seed plants. These are again\r\nbroken up into divisions, to which the name Natural Orders has been\r\ngiven. Most of us know, as the following are examined, Anemone,\r\nButtercup, Marsh Marigold, Globe Flower, and Larkspur, that they have\r\nthe same general structural arrangement, but in many particulars they\r\ndiffer. Thus these natural orders are again subdivided into genera, and\r\na still further subdivision into species is made.\r\n\r\nThe Cotton plant is put in the genus _Gossypium_, which is one falling\r\ninto the natural order _Malvacæ_, and which is one of a very large\r\nnumber forming an important division of the dicotyledons where the\r\nstamens are found to be inserted below the pistil, and where the corolla\r\nis composed of free separate petals, and where the plant has a flower\r\nbearing both calyx and corolla. So far as numbers are concerned, the\r\nMalvacæ cannot be said to be important, but few genera being known to\r\nfall into this order. Three are familiar at least--viz., the Marsh\r\nMallow, which was formerly used a great deal in making ointment; the\r\nMusk Mallow, and the Tree Mallow. The most important genus in this order\r\nis the Gossypium. This name was given to the Cotton plant by Pliny,\r\nthough the reasons for so doing are not clear. Very many species are\r\nknown to exist at the present time, and this is not to be wondered at,\r\nwhen the area in which the plant is cultivated is so vast, and coupled\r\nwith the fact that the plant is susceptible to the slightest change and\r\n\"sports\" most readily.\r\n\r\nDifferences of soil, climate, position with regard to the sea board, and\r\nvariations in the method of cultivation could only be expected to result\r\nin the species being exceedingly numerous. It is not surprising,\r\ntherefore, to find that no two botanists agree as to the number of\r\nspecies comprising the Gossypium family. A list, however, of the\r\ncommoner varieties found in various cotton-growing areas of the globe\r\nwill be given, but before doing so, it is deemed advisable to give a\r\ngeneral botanical description of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe Gossypium is either herbaceous, shrubby, or treelike, varying in\r\nheight from three to twenty feet. In some cases it is perennial; in\r\nmost, as in the cultivated species, it is an annual or biennial. A few\r\nexamples are noted for the vast number of hairs found everywhere on the\r\nplant, and on almost every part of the plant also, there may be observed\r\nblack spots or glands. Usually the stem is erect, and as a rule the\r\nCotton plant in form is not unlike the fir tree, that is, its lower\r\nbranches are wider than those above, and this gradual tapering extends\r\nto the top of the tree. In consequence of this it is said to be\r\n_terete_. The leaves are alternate, veined and petiolated, that is, they\r\nhave a leaf stalk connecting leaf and stem. In shape the leaves are\r\ncordate or heart-shaped, as well as sub-cordate, and the number of lobes\r\nfound in the leaf varies from three to seven. The stipules or little\r\nappendages found on the petioles, resembling small leaves in appearance\r\nand texture, are generally found in pairs. The calyx is cup-shaped, and\r\nthe petals of the flower are very conspicuous, and vary in colour\r\naccording to the species, being brownish-red, purple, rose-coloured,\r\nand yellow. The petals, five in number, are often joined together at the\r\nbase. The ovary is sessile, that is, it directly rests upon the main\r\nstem, and is usually three to five celled. The pod or capsule, which\r\ncontains the seeds and cotton fibre, when ripe splits into valves, which\r\nvary in number from three to five. A characteristic feature of the pod\r\nis the sharp top point formed by the meeting of the pointed valves. The\r\nseeds are numerous and very seldom smooth, being usually thickly covered\r\nwith fibrous matter known as raw cotton. As is well known, the wind\r\nperforms a very important function in the dispersal of seeds. It is\r\nclear that when a seed is ready to be set free, and is provided by a\r\ntuft of hair, such as is seen on the cotton seed, dandelion and willow\r\nherb, it becomes a very easy matter for it to be carried ever so far,\r\nwhen a good breeze is blowing. Most of us have blown, when children, at\r\nthe crown of white feathery matter in the dandelion, and have been\r\ndelighted to see the tiny parachutes carrying off its tiny seed to be\r\nafterward deposited, and ultimately take root and appear as a new plant.\r\nMuch in the same way, before it was cultivated, the Cotton plant\r\nperpetuated its own species. It should be added that the root of the\r\nCotton plant is tap shaped, and penetrates deeply into the earth.\r\n\r\nIt would be well nigh impossible to enumerate all the species which are\r\nnow known in the Cotton plant family, and it is not proposed here to\r\ndescribe more than the principal types of the Gossypium. In a report\r\nprepared by Mr. Tracy of Mississippi, U. S. A., no less than one\r\nhundred and thirty varieties of American cotton are given. He says:\r\n\"The word 'variety' refers exclusively to the various forms and kinds\r\nwhich are called varieties by cotton planters, and is not restricted to\r\nthe more marked and permanent types which are recognised by botanists.\r\nOf botanical varieties there are but few, while of agricultural\r\nvarieties there are an almost infinite number, and the names under which\r\nthe agricultural varieties are known are many times greater than the\r\nrecognisable forms.\" The Cotton plant most readily responds to any\r\nchanges of climate, methods of cultivation, change of soil or of\r\nfertilizers. So that it is easy to understand in a plant so susceptible\r\nand prone to vary as is the cotton, that new species may in a few years\r\nbe brought into existence, and especially by means of proper selection\r\nof the seed, and careful cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe chief commercial types of _Gossypium_ are--1. _Barbadense_; 2.\r\n_Herbaceum_; 3. _Hirsutum_; 4. _Arboreum_; 5. _Neglectum_; 6.\r\n_Peruvianum_.\r\n\r\n_Gossypium Barbadense._--The fine long silky fibres of commerce are all\r\nderived from this species. It is indigenous to a group of the West\r\nIndian Islands named the Lesser Antilles. It gets its name from\r\nBarbadoes, one of the West Indies. At the present time it is cultivated\r\nthroughout the Southern States of North America which border on the sea,\r\nin most of the West Indian Islands, Central America, Western Africa\r\nlying between the tropics, Bourbon, Egypt, Australia, and the East\r\nIndies. There is no doubt that the plant comes to its highest and most\r\nperfect state of cultivation when it is planted near the sea. Dr. Evans\r\nsays: \"It may be cultivated in any region adapted to the olive and near\r\nthe sea, the principal requisite being a hot and humid atmosphere, but\r\nthe results of acclimatisation indicate that the humid atmosphere is not\r\nentirely necessary if irrigation be employed, as this species is\r\nundoubtedly grown extensively in Egypt.\" The height of this species\r\nvaries from 3 to 4 feet if cultivated as an annual, and from 6 to 8 feet\r\nif allowed to grow as a perennial. When in full leaf and flower, it is a\r\nmost graceful-looking plant. Yarns having the finest counts, as they are\r\ncalled, are all spun from Sea Islands, which belongs to this class. When\r\nwe are told that a single pound of this cotton is often spun into a\r\nthread about 160 miles long we can see that it must be exceedingly good\r\nand strong cotton to do this.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 4.--The Gossypium Barbadense.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lint_ is the name given to the cotton which remains when separated from\r\nthe seeds. Every other American type of cotton gives a greater\r\npercentage of lint than the Sea Islands cotton, though it should be\r\nstated that the price per pound is greater than any other kind of cotton\r\ngrown in the States. There are from six to nine seeds in each capsule\r\nand the prevailing colour is black. A cotton grown in Egypt and known by\r\nthe name _Gallini_ is of the Sea Islands type and has been produced from\r\nseed of the G. Barbadense. It should be added that the colour of the\r\nflower is yellow and that in India this plant is known by the name of\r\nBourbon Cotton.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gossypium Herbaceum_.--As indicated by the name, this type is\r\nherbaceous in character, especially the cultivated type. When Lamarck\r\nclassified this tree, he gave it the name Indicum because he considered\r\nmost of the Indian types and some of the Chinese belonged to this\r\nparticular species. India, too, is considered by Parlatore to have been\r\nthe original home of the herbaceous type, and he specially fixes the\r\nCoromandel Coast as the first centre from which it sprang. There is much\r\nconflict of opinion in localising the primitive habitat of this type,\r\nand it is now thought that the present stock is probably the result of\r\nhybridisation of several species more or less related to each other.\r\nHowever, the areas in which this class of cotton grows are very numerous\r\nand extensive, for we find it growing in India, China, Arabia, Persia,\r\nAsia Minor, and Africa. A very characteristic feature of this plant is\r\nthat it quickly decays after podding, when cultivated as an annual.\r\n\r\nThe _Vine Cotton_ grown in Cuba belongs to the herbaceous type and is\r\nremarkable for its large pods, which contain an abnormal number of\r\nseeds. The so-called \"Nankeen\" cottons are said to be \"Colour\r\nvariations\" of the herbaceous Cotton plant. Many varieties of Egyptian\r\ncottons are produced from this particular class, as well as the Surat\r\ncotton of India.\r\n\r\nA feature which distinguishes this type is that the seeds are covered\r\nwith two kinds of fibre, a long and short, the latter being very dense.\r\nThe process of taking the longer fibre from the seed must be very\r\ncarefully watched, as it becomes a troublesome matter to remove the\r\nshorter fibre when once it has come away from the seed with the longer.\r\nHence great care should be taken in gathering this class of cotton.\r\nAnother point which should not be lost sight of is, that the herbaceous\r\ntype of Cotton plant readily hybridises with some other varieties and\r\nthe result is a strain of much better quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gossypium Hirsutum_.--This variety is so called because of the hairy\r\nnature of every part of the plant, leaves, stems, branches, pods and\r\nseeds--all having short hairs upon them. By Dr. Royle it is considered a\r\nsub-variety of the Barbadense cotton, and by other American experts it\r\nis given as synonymous with G. Herbaceum. However this may be, the plant\r\nhas certain well-defined characteristics which possibly entitle it to be\r\nconsidered as a distinct type. It has been asserted by a competent\r\nauthority that the original habitat of this particular cotton was\r\nMexico, and that from this country cultivators have imported it\r\nthroughout the sub-tropical districts of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is also stated that longstapled Georgian Uplands cotton belongs to\r\nthe Hirsutum variety. In fact most of the types cultivated in America\r\nfall into this class. Parlatore also considers it to be indigenous to\r\nMexico, and states that all green seeded cotton which is so extensively\r\ncultivated has been obtained from this type originally. M. Deschamps, in\r\ndescribing the Hirsutum species, says it is divided into two varieties,\r\none having green seeds, being of a hardier type, and the other having\r\ngreyish seeds, being more delicate and growing in the more southern\r\ndistricts of the States.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gossypium Arboreum_.--This plant attains treelike proportions, hence\r\nthe name Arboreum. In some cases it will grow as high as twenty feet. It\r\nis also known by the name G. Religiosum, because the cotton spun from\r\nthis plant was used only for making threads which were woven into cloth\r\nfor making turbans for the priests of India. Dr. Royle on one occasion\r\nwhile in that country was informed by the head gardener of a Botanical\r\nGarden at Saharunpore that this cotton was not used for making cloth for\r\nthe lower garments at all, its use being restricted to turbans for their\r\nheads, as it was sacred to the gods. That is why it also received the\r\nname, \"_Deo Cotton_.\"\r\n\r\nOne or two interesting features of this type may be pointed out. The\r\ncolour of the flowers is characteristic, being brownish and purply-red\r\nand having a dark spot purple in colour near the base of the corolla,\r\nthis latter being bell-shaped. Like the herbaceous type two kinds of\r\nfibre are found on the seed and great care is needed in the separation\r\nof them. Also, it should be pointed out that the fibres, in this class\r\nare with difficulty removed from the seed, clinging very tenaciously to\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe Arboreum type is indigenous to India and along the sea board washed\r\nby the Indian Ocean. The fibre from this species is much shorter in\r\naverage length than any of the preceding varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gossypium Neglectum._--This too is an Indian cotton, and according to\r\nRoyle the celebrated and beautiful Dacca cotton which gives the famous\r\nmuslins, as well as the long cloth of Madras, are made from cotton\r\nobtained from the Neglectum variety. An important feature of this plant\r\nis the small pod which bears the fibre and the small number of seeds\r\ncontained in each septa of the capsule, being only from five to eight in\r\nnumber. Like some preceding forms, the seeds carry cotton of two\r\nlengths, the shorter of the two being ashy green in colour. The longer\r\nfibre is harsh to the touch and white in colour. In many points it is\r\nvery similar to the Arboreum type and is considered by some botanists\r\nto be a cross between the Arboreum species and some other. It does not\r\nattain any great height, being often in bush form under two feet. The\r\ncountry of Five Rivers or the Punjaub, North West Provinces and Bengal,\r\nare the districts in India in which it is mostly cultivated as a field\r\ncrop. It has a high commercial value, forming the main bulk of the\r\ncotton produced in the Bengal presidency. This plant is indigenous to\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gossypium Peruvianum._--So called because Peru was considered to be the\r\nhabitat of this cotton. By some authorities this particular species is\r\nfor all practical purposes synonymous with the first type\r\ndescribed--viz., Barbadense. By others it is said to be closely allied\r\nto the Acuminatum variety, so named because of the pointed character of\r\nits capsules and leaves. Perhaps the most striking feature of this plant\r\nis the colour of the seeds, which is black. Another interesting point\r\nabout the seeds is that they adhere closely to each other, and form a\r\ncone-like mass. Brazil is the home of this particular species, though it\r\nis cultivated here in two forms, as \"Tree Cotton\" and as \"Herbaceous\r\nCotton.\" The former is also known by the name Crioulo or Maranhâo Cotton\r\nor short Mananams. It appears also that the Tree Cotton is one of the\r\nvery few which does not suffer from the depredations of the cotton\r\ncaterpillar. What is known as \"Kidney Cotton\" belongs to this species,\r\nwhich is sometimes named Braziliense. The name kidney is given because\r\nof the peculiar manner in which the seeds are arranged in the capsule,\r\nadhering together in each cell in the form of a kidney.\r\n\r\nThe most important countries in which it is grown are Brazil and Peru,\r\nthough it is produced in other districts outside these countries, but\r\nnot to any great extent.\r\n\r\nA very curious cotton which receives the name of \"Red Peruvian\" is also\r\nproduced in South America. On account of its colour, it has only a very\r\nlimited sale. This is owing to the difficulty there is in blending or\r\nmixing it with any other cotton of similar quality.\r\n\r\nCottons known generally as Santos, Cæra and Pernams are not of this\r\nspecies--viz., Gossypium Peruvianum, but belong to the first and second\r\nof the types already described.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Strength of Cotton Fibres.=--Mr. O'Neill some years ago made many\r\nexperiments with a view to obtaining the strengths of the different\r\nfibres, and the following table compiled by him, will be of interest to\r\nthe general reader.\r\n\r\n  Sea Islands           83.9 mean breaking strain in grains.\r\n  Queensland           147.6         \"                \"\r\n  Egyptian             127.2         \"                \"\r\n  Maranham             107.1         \"                \"\r\n  Bengueld             100.6         \"                \"\r\n  Pernambuco           140.2         \"                \"\r\n  New Orleans          147.7         \"                \"\r\n  Upland               104.5         \"                \"\r\n  Surat (Dhollerah)    141.9         \"                \"\r\n  Surat (Comptah)      163.7         \"                \"\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom this table it is arguable that the strength of fibre varies\r\naccording to the diameter, that is to say, the fibre with the thickest\r\ndiameter carries the highest strain. The order, therefore, in which the\r\nfibres would fall, according to strength, would be, Indian, American,\r\nAustralian, Brazilian, Egyptian, and Sea Islands last.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Chemistry of the Cotton Plant.=--Messrs. M'Bryde & Beal, Chemists in\r\nthe Experimental Station in Tennessee, say, \"As a rule our staple\r\nagricultural plants have not received the thorough, systematic chemical\r\ninvestigation that their importance demands.\" It would appear that until\r\nrecent times the above statement was only too true. Now, however, the\r\nUnited States Government and others have instituted experiments on a\r\nlarge scale, and everything is now being done in the direction of\r\nresearch, with a view to improving the quality of this important plant.\r\n\r\nA complete Cotton plant consists of roots, stems, leaves, bolls, seed\r\nand lint. Now if these six parts of the plant be weighed, they vary very\r\nmuch, proving that some of them are more exhaustive than others, so far\r\nas the fertilizing matters found in the soil are concerned. For example,\r\nif water be discarded in the calculation, though this takes up a fair\r\npercentage of the total weight, about 10, it is found that the roots\r\ntake up by weight over 8 per cent. of the whole plant, stems over 23 per\r\ncent., leaves over 20, bolls over 14, seeds over 23, and lint only\r\n10-1/2 per cent.\r\n\r\nNow this statement is interesting as showing one or two important\r\nfeatures. The weight of the seed is seen to be nearly a quarter of the\r\nwhole plant, while the stems and leaves together take up nearly one\r\nhalf. A very small proportion by weight of the plant is taken by the\r\nlint.\r\n\r\nA chemical analysis of the mature Cotton plant yielded the following\r\nsubstances:--\r\n\r\n  Water.                      Potash.\r\n  Ash.                        Lime.\r\n  Nitrogen.                   Magnesia.\r\n  Phosphoric acid.            Sulphuric acid.\r\n  Insoluble matter.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf ten analyses made with the cotton lint (which takes up about 10-1/2\r\nper cent. of the whole) M'Bryde states that the average amount of water\r\nfound was 6.77, ash 1.8, nitrogen .2, phosphoric acid .05, potash .85,\r\nlime .15, and magnesia .16.\r\n\r\nHe very pertinently remarks also \"that if the lint were the only part of\r\nthe plant removed from the land on which it is grown, cotton would be\r\none of the least exhaustive of farm crops. The only other part which\r\nneed be permanently lost to the soil is the oil, which also contains\r\nvery small amounts of fertilising constituents.\" In connection with this\r\nhe further says \"that even when the seed is taken away along with the\r\nlint, cotton still removes smaller amounts of fertilising materials from\r\nthe soil than either oats or corn.\" It should be borne in mind that the\r\nsoil upon which cotton is cultivated lies fallow for a greater part of\r\nthe year, and the fact of absence of cultivation, with consequent\r\nnon-fertilising and non-enriching of land, must tend in the direction of\r\nsoil exhaustion by the Cotton plant.\r\n\r\nAnother useful and important fact in connection with the Cotton plant is\r\nthe medicinal use to which the roots are put. According to the _American\r\nJournal of Pharmacy_, the bark from the roots of the Cotton plant\r\ncontain an active ingredient which in its effects is very much like\r\nergot.\r\n\r\nChemical investigations have conclusively proved that the ripe fibre of\r\nthe Cotton plant is composed of the following substances:--\r\n\r\nCarbon, Hydrogen, Oxygen, and they tell us that when cotton is fully\r\nripe it is almost pure cellulose.\r\n\r\nDr. Bowman has pointed out that the percentage of water in cotton fibre\r\n\"varies with different seasons from 1 to 4 per cent. in the new crop,\r\nand rather less as the season advances. Above 2 per cent. of moisture,\r\nhowever, seems to be an excessive quantity even in a new crop cotton,\r\nand when more than this is present it is either the result of a wet\r\nseason and the cotton has been packed before drying, or else it has been\r\nartificially added.\"\r\n\r\nAbout one fifth of the whole plant by weight consists of the seed, and\r\nan analysis of this shows them to be composed of water, ash, nitrogen,\r\nphosphoric acid, potash, soda, lime, magnesia, sulphuric acid, ferric\r\noxide, chlorine, and insoluble matter.\r\n\r\nAs a commercial product seeds are exceedingly valuable, and yield the\r\nfollowing substances:--oil, meal, hulls, and linters. When the hulls are\r\nground they receive the name of cotton seed bran. The inside of the\r\nseed, when the hull has been removed, is often called the kernel and is\r\nsometimes also designated peeled seed, hulled seed, and meats. It is\r\nthis kernel seed which, when properly treated, yields large supplies of\r\noil and meal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCOTTON-PLANT DISEASES AND PESTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several classes of agents all of which act injuriously more or\r\nless on the Cotton plant.\r\n\r\n     1. Climatic changes, including hygrometric variations of the\r\n        atmosphere, and extremes of heat and cold.\r\n\r\n     2. Insect pests.\r\n\r\n     3. Physiological diseases of the plant.\r\n\r\n     4. Blights caused by fungi.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out in the early pages of this story, how very\r\nsensible to changes of heat and cold, the Cotton plant is, especially in\r\nthe early growing period. When the plant has just risen above the\r\nground, and is beginning to spread its roots, too great an amount of\r\nheat would be fatal to its further growth.\r\n\r\nInstances could be given where very serious decreases in the production\r\nof cotton in the States especially have taken place, due entirely to\r\nunusually high temperatures which obtained during the early growing\r\nperiod of the Cotton plant.\r\n\r\nExtremes of frost are likewise fatal to the growth of the young plant.\r\nBy the beginning of April, frosts have as a rule disappeared, and no\r\nfurther fear need be felt on that account, though if the end of winter\r\nhas been abnormally warm, and the young plants have been making leaf too\r\nquickly, it will be readily seen how fatal a sharp frost or two must be\r\nto the young and tender plant. There are cases, however, when a frost\r\nis beneficial.\r\n\r\nThen again, while rain is needed in fair quantity, too much of it is\r\nfollowed by rot and myriads of pests. If the planter desires anything at\r\nall when his crop is ripe, it is fine weather in which to gather his\r\nharvest.\r\n\r\nFrequently large quantities of cotton are left on the plantations,\r\nbecause it is too wet to gather it. This happened a few years ago to an\r\nunusual extent, when a vast quantity of cotton had to be left upon the\r\nfields.\r\n\r\nOf all the injurious agents most dreaded in the cotton-growing districts\r\nof the globe, none are so widely spread or so disastrous as \"insect\r\npests.\"\r\n\r\nThey attack different parts of the plant during its growth, and when the\r\nbolls are formed they commit great havoc among these by boring through\r\nand completely ruining the immature fibre. Then again, while the plant\r\nis young, they may attack the most tender portion of the plant, viz.,\r\nthe new and young leaves found at or near the top. This they soon clear\r\nand make their way as caterpillars down the plant, and they frequently\r\nclear it as though the leaves had been plucked off.\r\n\r\nSo completely do they do their work that it has been calculated in\r\ncertain years the loss on this account alone cannot have been far short\r\nin America of 3-1/2 million pounds in one year.\r\n\r\nOf the chief forms of insect pests, two specially stand out into\r\nprominence, both of which belong to the moth tribe of insects, viz.,\r\n_Alethia argillacea_ or Cotton Caterpillar, and the _Heliothis armiger_\r\nor Cotton Boll-Caterpillar.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the former are mostly confined to devastating the\r\nleaves and buds, while the latter confines its special attention to the\r\nbolls which, were they allowed to ripen, would burst with cotton.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the former, too, are laid on the under side of the upper\r\nleaves and vast numbers are deposited. The moth flies by night, and the\r\neggs laid are extremely difficult to discover--indeed it takes an expert\r\nto quickly find them.\r\n\r\nUsually, about midsummer, the eggs are hatched in three or four days and\r\nthen comes the period for spoliation.\r\n\r\nAll that is tender is assimilated, usually the under side of the young\r\ntender leaves found at the top of the plant.\r\n\r\nDuring this stage of its existence the caterpillar moults five times and\r\nthe larva period varies somewhat according to the weather from one to\r\nthree weeks.\r\n\r\nThe chrysalis or pupa state covers from one week to four, and at last\r\nemerges as a beautiful olive gray moth with a purplish lustre.\r\n\r\nIn about four days the female commences to lay eggs very rapidly and\r\nwill lay sometimes as many as six hundred during its life. No wonder,\r\nthen, with several generations during a season and vast numbers of\r\nmoths, that untold damages can be wrought by these particular insects in\r\na single season.\r\n\r\nA number of remedies has been successfully applied in the direction of\r\nspraying various chemical solutions, and in sowing plants which have had\r\nthe direct effect of reducing the spread of this terrible pest. Its\r\nmethod of working can be seen on referring to Fig. 4.\r\n\r\nNow the Boll-Caterpillar, though it lives much in the same way as the\r\nAlethia, has a very different method of procedure so far as its\r\ndestructive habits are concerned.\r\n\r\nAnd its fields and pastures, too, are by no means confined to one\r\ncontinent, or to one kind of plant, for it attacks both the tomato and\r\ncorn plants. According to Dr. Howard, \"It feeds upon peas, beans,\r\ntobacco, pumpkin, squash, okra, and a number of garden flowering plants,\r\nsuch as cultivated geranium, gladiolus, mignonette, as well as a number\r\nof wild plants.\" As the name indicates, the Boll-Caterpillar makes the\r\nboll its happy hunting-ground. The eggs are laid in the same way by the\r\nparent moth as the Cotton Caterpillar or Alethia, and when hatched the\r\nyoung powerfully jawed caterpillar makes its way to the newly-formed\r\nboll, and applying itself vigorously, very soon gains an entrance. Here\r\nit rests for a time, eating away at the best it can find. It ultimately\r\nemerges and is transformed into the pupa, taking up its quarters in the\r\nground, until the next change takes place, when in a week or two's time\r\nit appears as a moth much the same in size as its cousin the Alethia,\r\nbut coloured ochre yellow to dull olive-green and being more varied in\r\nits markings. It will lay during one season about 500 eggs.\r\n\r\nMany remedies have been applied for the extirpation of this particular\r\ninsect, but these only seem to have met with partial success. It will\r\nreadily be seen how much more difficult this pest is to deal with than\r\nthe preceding one. Living as it does in the boll and in the ground for a\r\ngreat part of its existence, it will be exceedingly difficult to get\r\nat.\r\n\r\nIn Mexico what is known as the Cotton-Boll Weevil (_Anthonomus grundis_)\r\nappears to do great mischief to the Cotton plant. It does most damage\r\nduring the larvæ stage, eating up the tender portions of the boll while\r\nin residence here. When matured it is only a little under half an inch\r\nin length.\r\n\r\nMany other insects act injuriously upon the Cotton plant, but the\r\nfollowing may be taken as the chief: Cotton Cutworm (_Feltia malefida_);\r\nCotton lice (_Aphis gossypii_). Among the lepidoptera may be mentioned,\r\n_Cocæcia rosaceana_, or \"Leaf-roller,\" so called from its habit of\r\ncuriously rolling the leaves of the Cotton plant and then feeding inside\r\nthe roll. Then grasshoppers and locusts occasionally do some damage, as\r\nwell as a beetle named _Ataxia crypta_, which is noted for attacking the\r\nstalks of the Cotton plants, but it should be pointed out this beetle\r\ndoes not prey upon healthy and vigorous plants at all.\r\n\r\nScores of other insects could be mentioned as injurious, though some of\r\nthem do but very slight damage indeed to the Cotton plant.\r\n\r\nIt does appear, however, from long years of experiment and observations,\r\nthat little damage needs to be feared if the plants, while growing, and\r\nduring the formation of the boll, can be carefully watched and guarded.\r\nThe plants when matured are better able to withstand the onslaughts\r\nwhich these predaceous insects make upon them.\r\n\r\nThen again, there are large numbers of physiological diseases of the\r\ncotton due to inherent weakness of the plant or failure of assimilative\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, vast numbers of fungi, too numerous to mention here, work\r\nserious injury to leaf, flower and boll in certain seasons of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF THE COTTON PLANT IN DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what has already been said, it will be quite clear that the Cotton\r\nplant will only successfully thrive in those regions on the earth's\r\nsurface where there are suitable temperature and soil, and a proper and\r\nadequate supply of moisture both in the atmosphere and soil. When the\r\n45th parallel of North Latitude is reached, the plant ceases to grow\r\nexcept under glass or in exceptionally well favoured and temperate\r\ndistricts. Below the Equator the southern limit is the 35th parallel.\r\n\r\nWith a model of the globe before him, the reader will see, if he mark\r\nthe two lines already named, what a small belt the \"Cotton-growing zone\"\r\nis, compared with the rest of the globe, and yet in 1901 it is estimated\r\nthat no fewer than 10,486,000 bales of 500 lbs. net average each were\r\nproduced in the United States alone, 695,000 came from the cotton fields\r\nof India, from Egypt 1,224,000, an increase of 600,000 bales in ten\r\nyears. This vast quantity does not include what was produced in other\r\ncountries, which we know in the aggregate was very considerable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=American Cultivation of the Cotton Plant.=--Perhaps no country\r\nillustrates the fact so well as does the United States, that the\r\nvariations in the quality of cotton are very largely--it may be said\r\nalmost entirely--due to distance from sea board, height above sea level\r\nand difference of soil.\r\n\r\nThe surface geology of the Southern United States as a whole, is of a\r\nmost diversified character, and the following States in which cotton is\r\nproduced, in many cases show a similar variation.\r\n\r\n  North Carolina.             Tennessee.\r\n  South Carolina.             Alabama.\r\n  Georgia.                    Mississippi.\r\n  Florida.                    Louisiana.\r\n  Arkansas.                   Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps Texas shows the greatest number of distinct soil areas, viz.,\r\neight. Height above the sea level has also a considerable influence upon\r\nthe plants cultivated, and only the hardier and more robust types are to\r\nbe found on the more elevated lands. At the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury South Carolina produced more cotton than any other State. Fifty\r\nyears later, Alabama was to the front. Ten years later, Mississippi led\r\nthe way, and in 1901 Texas occupied the premier position with 3,526,649\r\nbales, followed in order by Georgia and Mississippi.\r\n\r\nThe following table from Bulletin 100 of the Bureau of the Census,\r\nDepartment of Commerce and Labor, gives the acreage devoted to\r\ncultivation of cotton in 1908 as follows:\r\n\r\n  Alabama         3,591,000 acres.\r\n  Arkansas        2,296,000   \"\r\n  Florida           265,000   \"\r\n  Georgia         4,848,000   \"\r\n  Louisiana       1,550,000   \"\r\n  Mississippi     3,395,000   \"\r\n  Missouri           87,000   \"\r\n  North Carolina  1,458,000   \"\r\n  Oklahoma        2,311,000   \"\r\n  South Carolina  2,545,000   \"\r\n  Tennessee         754,000   \"\r\n  Texas           9,316,000   \"\r\n  Virginia           28,000   \"\r\n                 ----------\r\n                 32,444,000   \"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe figure for Missouri includes other cotton-producing localities not\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\nBefore dealing with the actual cultivation of cotton, as carried on in\r\nthe States, it will be well to briefly name the kind of soils which are\r\nmet with in this cotton area. Generally speaking, soils are divided into\r\nthe following classes:--\r\n\r\n  Clayey soils.\r\n  Clayey loam soils.\r\n  Loamy soils.\r\n  Sandy loam soils.\r\n  Sandy soils.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis classification is determined by the relative percentage of sand and\r\nclay.\r\n\r\nIn the States we have all these types, and in some districts they lie\r\nwithin easy reach of each other. It should be pointed out that\r\nsufficient and uniform heat and humidity are essential to the\r\nproduction of good cotton crops, and as the sandy soils are of an open\r\ncharacter, it is plain that moisture will readily pass from these, while\r\nthe heavy clays act just in the opposite direction, viz., prevent the\r\nuniform evaporation of the moisture within them; hence, as a rule,\r\nclayey lands are moist and damp, and it has been found from observation\r\nthat on lands of this class, a good deal of wood and leaf are produced,\r\nand but little fruit relatively. A matter therefore which must not be\r\nlost sight of, is that a suitable texture should be found, or, in other\r\nwords, the amount of sand and clay in the soils should be in the right\r\nproportion. Of course, however suitable a soil may be, if the climatic\r\nconditions are adverse, only failure can result. Given good land,\r\nproperly drained and a suitable temperature, together with an uniform\r\nsupply of moisture, heavy crops may be expected. Sudden changes in the\r\ntemperature, and variations in the amount of moisture, certainly act\r\ndeleteriously upon the plant, especially during the period in which the\r\nyoung one is growing. There is a great difference between a wet soil and\r\na moist one, and there is perhaps nothing so much dreaded by the\r\nplanters as a sodden soil. Up to the end of July the soil should be\r\ncontinuously and uniformly moist, and it would appear that, provided\r\nthis condition is satisfied, there is every likelihood of a heavy crop\r\nresulting, if the temperature has been anything like suitable. Looked at\r\nfrom every point of view, therefore, the best and safest soil in which\r\nto grow cotton is a deep loam where there is every probability of the\r\nnecessary conditions being fulfilled.\r\n\r\nAs compared with sixty years ago the present methods of cultivation\r\nshow very great differences. Most of us are acquainted with the\r\nconditions of labour which existed at that time. Mrs. H. Beecher Stowe,\r\nin her pathetic and life-like story, \"Uncle Tom's Cabin,\" has given us\r\nsuch a glimpse into slave life that she has placed us all under lasting\r\nobligations to her. Happily all that has gone and the slave, as such, is\r\nnow known no more in America. Three causes are said to have done more to\r\nchange the methods of American cotton cultivation than anything else,\r\nviz.:--\r\n\r\n  The Civil War.\r\n  The abolition of slavery.\r\n  Introduction of artificial fertilisers.\r\n\r\nThere are those who affirm to-day that the last-named has been the most\r\npotent factor of the three.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, previous to the war, crop after crop was grown upon the\r\nsame land without any thought of returning those elements, in the form\r\nof manure, to the earth, which it so much required. But immediately\r\nafter the conclusion of the war, the conditions of labour were changed\r\nand it became a matter of absolute necessity to find something which\r\nwould give life to the land, hence the introduction of fertilisers. It\r\nis stated on the authority of Dr. White of Georgia, that it would be\r\n\"difficult to conceive how cotton culture could have been continued or\r\nsustained but for the use of such manures.\"\r\n\r\nIn a work of this kind it is impossible to describe in detail the\r\nvarious methods of cultivation adopted in the several cotton States, but\r\nthe following will give a fair idea of what actually takes place on a\r\nlarge cotton plantation, assuming that the land is well drained. It\r\nshould be said here draining has not received that attention which it\r\nought to have done, and many of the failures put down to other causes\r\nare now known to have been due entirely to bad drainage. As an\r\nalternative to proper drainage, the practice of raising the Cotton plant\r\nbeds and cultivating them to greater depth, has been followed. Most of\r\nthe planters are too poor to drain properly, and so adopt the banking\r\nmethod, though in the long run this is the more expensive of the two.\r\n\r\nLet us assume that the cotton crop has all been gathered. We have an\r\nimmense quantity of old cotton stalks which need removing. This is\r\nusually done before February. As a rule, the litter is gathered into\r\nheaps and burned. Ploughing and harrowing next follow, and ridges are\r\nformed which in the elevated districts are not quite so far apart as in\r\nthe low-lying areas. We can see that in the latter districts the plants\r\nwill be much more prolific and grow to a better state of perfection,\r\nhence more room must be allowed for them. These ridges lie, in some\r\ncases, 3 feet apart and in others 4 and 5.\r\n\r\nEspecially when manures or fertilisers have been used, bedding up is\r\ngenerally adopted.\r\n\r\nAs is to be expected in a country like America, the very best and most\r\napproved methods of cultivation are followed, hence the old system of\r\nsowing seed by hand is discarded, and seed-planting machines are now\r\ncoming into general use. The distance apart which the seeds (about five\r\nor six in one hole) should be set, is still a moot question, but it is\r\ngenerally admitted to be unsafe to plant at greater distances than 12\r\ninches. When sown, a light covering is put over, and in a few\r\ndays--about twelve generally--the tiny plants make their appearance. Two\r\nor three days after, another leaf is seen, and it may be said that the\r\nreal and anxious work of the cultivator now begins. In the Carolina\r\ndistricts this will happen about the end of April. The planting in the\r\nmore southern States will take place earlier. What has next to be done\r\nis very particular work, viz., cutting down and thinning the plants,\r\nwhich, if allowed to grow, would simply choke one another. Here and\r\nthere at suitable distances, groups of plants in the same row are\r\nselected as \"stands\" or groups of plants from which will be selected the\r\nbest plant, which is allowed to go forward in its growth; all the rest\r\nbeing chopped out or weeded out.\r\n\r\nBanking up or bedding up is the next process, and this is done running\r\nthe plough in the spaces between the ridges or practically over the old\r\ncotton bed of the preceding season. This will improve the ventilating\r\npower of the bed considerably and prevent somewhat the logging of the\r\nsoil, which is extremely undesirable. The plough is immediately followed\r\nby the field labourers, whose work is now to draw the loose soil round\r\nthe Cotton plants. This last process of \"hauling\" completes the\r\nlabourers' work for a time, and is done for the purpose of keeping the\r\nplant erect and preventing it from falling down. This hauling process is\r\nrepeated until July, when only one plant is left out of the five or six\r\nwhich were planted originally. After four haulings, which are completed\r\nas a rule by the end of July, the productive processes may be said to be\r\ncompleted. If the weather has been favourable and the soil kept fairly\r\nmoist, a good crop may be fully anticipated. What the planters like to\r\nsee during the growing period is a summer in which the sun shines every\r\nday, accompanied by those frequent and gentle showers which clean the\r\nplant and give the necessary humidity to the atmosphere and soil. Two\r\nthings are dreaded by the planter--excessive heats and abnormal showers.\r\nThe bloom appears about the middle of June and a couple of months after\r\nthis the plants are ready for picking. This operation usually is carried\r\non from the beginning of September or end of August right on into\r\nNovember, sometimes through this month into December. Here are given a\r\nfew particulars which have been collected by Shepperson bearing on this\r\nparticular subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n+-------------+---------+----------+---------+------------------+---------+\r\n|             |  Usual  |          |  Usual  |                  |  Usual  |\r\n|             | date to |Usual date| date to |  Usual date to   | date to |\r\n|             |  begin  | to begin | finish  |  begin Picking.  | finish  |\r\n|    STATES   |Preparing| Planting.|Planting.|                  | Picking.|\r\n|             |   the   |          |         |                  |         |\r\n|             |  Land.  |          |         |                  |         |\r\n+-------------+---------+----------+---------+------------------+---------+\r\n| N.

Mexico.\r\nWest Indies.                  Peru and the South Sea Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cultivation of Cotton in Brazil.=--From a very remote period, cotton has\r\nbeen cultivated in Brazil. Early in the sixteenth century historians\r\nrefer to the uses to which cotton was put at that time. Seguro, in his\r\nwork describing the customs of the ancient people who lived in the\r\nAmazon valleys, says that the arrows used in connection with their\r\nblowguns were covered with cotton. It is probable that, before the dawn\r\nof the eighteenth century, the cultivation of cotton was practised more\r\nor less throughout the country. Up to thirty years ago, it looked as\r\nthough the cotton-growing industry in Brazil was likely to be an\r\nincreasing and profitable business. Owing, however, to many causes, the\r\ntrade has not grown as was to have been expected.\r\n\r\nAmong the chief of these causes are:--\r\n\r\n    1. Laxity of method in cultivating.\r\n    2. Poor means of transmission.\r\n    3. Severe competition by the United States.\r\n    4. Disturbed condition of the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nAll these have helped to keep down an industry which at one time bade\r\nfair to be a source of great income to the country.\r\n\r\nTree Cotton and Herbaceous Cotton are both cultivated in Brazil. The\r\nbest kinds of Sea Islands have been tried, but have not succeeded.\r\n\r\nCompared with the United States, the methods of cultivation pursued in\r\nBrazil are exceedingly primitive and irregular. No such thing as\r\nploughing or preparing of the soil is adopted.\r\n\r\nThe only preparation seems to be to rid the land of cotton stumps, and\r\nthis is done in a somewhat careless and indifferent manner. It would\r\nseem that as little labour as possible is expended upon the land in\r\npreparing it for the reception of seed. Hilaire's aphorism--\"Nothing in\r\nthis country is less expensive, or more productive, than cotton\r\nculture\"--would seem, when the facts of the whole case are known, to be\r\nperfectly warranted so far as Brazil is concerned. Certainly, from a\r\nclimatic point of view, this country is exceptionally well favoured, an\r\nequable and suitable temperature together with an adequate supply of\r\nearth and air, moisture and rich alluvial soils, a long dry season for\r\npicking extending over many weeks--all point to an ideal cotton-growing\r\narea. In fact, there is no reason why a crop of at least 40,000,000\r\nbales should not be obtained annually in Brazil, if needed. At present,\r\nonly about one three-hundredth part of this is grown. The cotton-growing\r\ncentres are Minas Geraes, Bahia, Fernando de Noronha, Rio Janeiro, Sao\r\nPaulo.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cotton Cultivation in Mexico.=--The cultivation of cotton has for many\r\ncenturies been carried on in Mexico. Much the same drawbacks exist here\r\nas in Brazil, viz., lack of labour, poor railway system, high rates for\r\ntransmission, and indifferent methods employed in cultivating.\r\n\r\nMexico enjoys a splendid geographical position and would prove, if the\r\nbusiness-like habits and methods obtained as in case of the States, one\r\nof the most serious competitors of its adjacent Northern neighbour.\r\n\r\nThe best cotton is produced in the State of Guerrero on the Eastern\r\nside, though the greater part--about one half--of the Mexican crop is\r\ngrown in Laguna district, which lies in the Coahuila country. There are\r\nthree distinct areas of production in Mexico, viz., along the Eastern\r\ncoast, along the Western coast, and on the Central tableland. In the\r\nWestern area irrigation is resorted to.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1898, 100,000,000 pounds of cotton were grown, though all or\r\nnearly all of it was used at home. Within the last twenty years many\r\nmills have been erected in this country, and this will account for the\r\nlarge quantity of cotton consumed at home. The poorest Mexican cotton is\r\nproduced in Chiapas. Acapulco, near the mouth of the Grande del Norte\r\nRiver, is the chief Mexican cotton port on the Eastern coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cotton-growing in Peru.=--It would be a difficult matter to fix a time\r\nwhen cotton was first grown in Peru. Pizarro, who conquered this country\r\nearly in the sixteenth century, found that the natives were fully\r\nengaged in the growing and spinning of cotton. Dr. Dabney, Assistant\r\nSecretary of the U.S.A. Agricultural Department, states that he has seen\r\na cloth made of cotton recently taken from one of the Peruvian mummies\r\nwhich must be many, many centuries old. There is not the slightest doubt\r\nthat the Cotton plant is indigenous to Peru.\r\n\r\nThirty-five years ago Liverpool received no less than 300,000 pounds\r\nweight of cotton from Peru, and three years later over 4,000,000 pounds.\r\nDuring the last decade of the century it exceeded 6,000,000 pounds to\r\nEngland alone. Two kinds of Peruvian cotton are grown--smooth and rough.\r\nThis latter is a rough, strong fibre, and is exceptionally well adapted\r\nfor mixing with wool in the manufacture of hosiery, and a greater part\r\nof this cotton coming in England is used in the hosiery trade. The\r\nplant from which it is produced is a perennial, and for six or seven\r\nyears is said to give two crops a year. Owing to the peculiarly\r\nfavourable climate of Peru and the suitability of the soil, it is\r\nexceedingly improbable that any strong competitor will come to divert\r\nthe Peruvian trade, so that for some time yet we may look to this\r\ncountry supplying the hosiery trade with rough Peruvian cotton. The\r\nimportations of Peruvian cotton into the United States for 1894-95 were\r\n24,000 bales; for 1895-96, 24,603 bales; for 1896-97, 16,604 bales.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Cultivation of Cotton in India.=--There are other Asiatic cotton\r\nfields besides those of India, viz., China, Corea, Japan, the Levant,\r\nand Russia in Asia. The term \"India\" will be used in a somewhat\r\nrestricted sense in this section, and will cover only that huge\r\ntriangular-shaped peninsula lying to the south of Thibet in Asia. It is\r\n1800 miles in width and nearly 2000 miles in length. The total area, not\r\nincluding Assam and Burmah, is about 1,300,000 square miles, the native\r\nstates alone covering 595,000 square miles.\r\n\r\nOut of the 28° of North Latitude through which India stretches, no less\r\nthan 15-1/2° are in the tropics, the remainder being in the Temperate\r\nZone. The climate, owing to a number of circumstances, such as different\r\naltitudes and uneven distribution of moisture, is exceedingly varied.\r\n\r\nDuring the months April to September the sun, during the day or some\r\npart of it, is overhead. Consequently the heat received will be greater\r\nthan over the ocean at the south, taking a similar area. A direct cause\r\nof this is the starting of winds which receive the name of monsoons.\r\nThese blow from the S.W., and bring vast quantities of moisture with\r\nthem. This moisture-laden wind is partially robbed of its load as it\r\nstrikes the Western Ghats and consequently much moisture is deposited\r\nhere, giving rise to many valuable rivers which water the Deccan or\r\nCentral Tableland of India. The Mahanuddy, Godavari, Kristna, and\r\nKauvari are rivers fed by the S.W. monsoon. Then, again, the low-lying\r\nlands near the mouth of the Indus, the great desert of Rajputana, the\r\npeninsula of Gujerat and the district of Malwa--all allow, by reason of\r\ntheir low-lying nature, the S.W. winds to pass over them laden as they\r\nare with vast quantities of moisture. They travel on till they meet the\r\nHimalayas, where again they help to swell the volume of the waters in\r\nthe rivers Ganges and Indus. When the N.E. monsoons blow they do not\r\ncarry anything like the amount of moisture which the S.W. monsoons do,\r\nas their areas of collection are very much more limited. Consequently\r\nthis part of the year is usually a dry one (viz., from October to\r\nMarch).\r\n\r\nThus it will be seen that the great plain of Southern India is much less\r\nwatered than the more Northerly portions and consequently is much less\r\nfertile. This fact must be borne in mind as the cotton-growing areas are\r\ndescribed and indicated.\r\n\r\nIndia, which grows more cotton than any other country in the world (the\r\nStates excepted), may be said to possess four distinct areas for the\r\nproduction of commercial cotton. They are--\r\n\r\n    1. Central Tableland or Deccan.\r\n    2. Valley of the Ganges.\r\n    3. Western India.\r\n    4. Southern India.\r\n\r\nand the above order shows them also according to their commercial\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Central District._--This is a vast plateau bounded on the north by the\r\nVindhya mountains, on the east and west by the Ghats of those names, and\r\non the south by the River Krishna. As is to be expected, the collecting\r\nand exporting of the cottons grown in this district are done at Bombay.\r\nThe finest cottons grown in India are produced in this region.\r\n\r\nFour centres stand out prominently in the production of cotton, viz.,\r\nDharwar, Hyderabad, Nagpore and Berar. The soils generally in the Deccan\r\nare very rich and capable of retaining moisture during the growing term\r\nof the plant's life. What are known as the black soils of India are to\r\nbe found plentifully in this district, and these are exceedingly rich in\r\nmineral matter. Nagpore should specially be named, as it is in this\r\nprovince that the finest cotton grown in all India is produced, viz.:--\r\n\r\n    \"Hingunghat Cotton.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Oomrawattee Cotton\" is the name given to a special kind which is\r\nproduced in the province of Berar. It is sometimes called \"Oomras.\" This\r\ndistrict lies in the \"Nizam's Dominions\" and is watered by several\r\ntributaries of the Tapti and Godivari. It possesses a soil which for\r\nrichness and fertility has no equal in India.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Bengal, this district is more plentifully supplied\r\nwith rivers than any other part of India.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 5.--An Indian cotton field.\r\n\r\nThe Dharwar district is noted for its cottons, for two or three reasons.\r\nIt was in this region that in 1842 New Orleans cotton was planted with\r\na view to its ultimately being cultivated here. As the climate and soil\r\nare very similar to some of the districts in the Mississippi valley, it\r\nsucceeded beyond anticipation. Dharwar lies S. W. of the province of\r\nHyderabad near the sea, and almost touches 15° N. Latitude.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Valley of the Ganges District_ cannot be said to grow very good\r\ncotton, though it was in this region, at Dacca, that in former days the\r\ncotton which was afterward made into the celebrated Dacca muslin was\r\ngrown.\r\n\r\nBy far the greater part of the fibre produced in this district comes\r\nfrom two centres: (1) Bundelkhand, which lies 79° E. Long., and 25° N.\r\nLatitude (this is very near to Allahabad), and (2) Doab. As was pointed\r\nout in describing the monsoons, these two centres suffer by reason of\r\ndroughts, owing mainly to their geographical position. They are subject\r\nalso to severe floods, which are certainly against successful\r\ncultivation of cotton. The entire crop of the North West Provinces may\r\nbe said to come from the districts of Doab and Bundelkhand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Western India District._--The three centres for the production of\r\ncotton in the west, may be said to be Peninsula of Guzerat, the Island\r\nof Cutch and the Delta district of the Indus named Sind. The whole of\r\nthese provinces lies in what may be called a dry area, missing, as was\r\nshown, much of the S. W. monsoon, which ultimately finds its way across\r\ncountry to the Himalayas. Consequently there will be little rainfall in\r\nthis area, Sind and Cutch not more than 10 inches, some parts of Guzerat\r\nhaving much more.\r\n\r\nThis has a very serious effect upon the quality of the cotton produced.\r\n\r\nThe Surat, Broach and Sind Cottons, all poor types, are all grown in\r\nthis part of India.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Southern India District._--This lies in the southern part of the\r\nResidency of Madras, and east of the province of Travancore. The\r\nNilgiris and Shevaroy Hills are found here, as are also the Cauvery and\r\nVaigai Rivers. The cotton districts best known are Coimbatore and\r\nTinnevelley, both of which are admirably situated and well watered. The\r\nCalicut of fame which gave rise to the name Calico is also in this\r\ndistrict. Tinnevelley lies almost at the extreme south of India on the\r\nGulf of Manaar opposite to Island of Ceylon. Its cotton is well known,\r\nbut is of a poor type. As far back as 1847, experiments carried out\r\nunder the superintendence of Dr. Wright proved that this district was\r\nvery suitable for the cultivation of American cotton. A fact interesting\r\nas well as instructive is given by him to the effect that in the\r\nsouthern part of India the crops universally failed where grown from the\r\nnative seed, while those grown from American seed realised very fair\r\namounts--better even than were obtained when good crops were got after\r\nusing Indian seed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe methods of preparing, planting, and cultivating the Indian Plants\r\nare exceedingly antiquated. In but few districts are anything like\r\nmodern methods practised. Advantage however is taken of the period just\r\npreceding the rain monsoon and this differs a little according to the\r\ndistrict. Thus in Bengal, Berar, and Broach, May and June are usually\r\ntaken for scantily preparing the land, and in Madras and Dharwar,\r\nAugust and September. This consists of turning over the soil and burying\r\nthe old Cotton plants of the previous season which have been allowed to\r\nrot. As no fertilisers are used, these roots and branches at best make a\r\nvery poor substitute. Ploughing, hoeing and other agricultural\r\noperations are of the rudest types and oxen are used for almost\r\neverything in the way of heavy labour. Farm implements, gearing carts,\r\netc., are all of a style and differ very little from those used\r\ncenturies ago. The seeds are sown broadcast, and almost everything is\r\ndone by hand.\r\n\r\nThe plantations as a rule are much smaller than those in America,\r\nrunning from 5 to 30 acres. On the larger plantations the cotton is\r\ncultivated mainly by paid labourers.\r\n\r\nThe following table, by Shepperson, shows the acreage devoted to cotton\r\nof the different states in India:--\r\n\r\n  Bombay and Sind         5,021,000 acres.\r\n  Punjaub                 1,177,000  \"\r\n  N. W. Provinces         1,424,000  \"\r\n  Bengal                    153,000  \"\r\n  Rajputana                 549,000  \"\r\n  Central India             503,000  \"\r\n  Berar                   2,307,000  \"\r\n  Central Provinces         616,000  \"\r\n  Hyderabad (Nizam's)     2,308,000  \"\r\n  Madras                  1,655,000  \"\r\n  Mysore        }\r\n  Assam         }           230,000  \"\r\n  Burmah (Lower)}\r\n  Burmah (Upper)}\r\n  Ajmere and Meywara        40,000   \"\r\n                        ----------\r\n                        15,983,000   \"\r\n\r\n\r\nBombay, Kurrachee, Calcutta, Madras, Tuticorin and Cocanada are the\r\nchief Indian cotton ports.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cotton-growing in Russia in Asia.=--Lying immediately north of Persia and\r\nAfghanistan and south of Khirghiz Steppes lies an immense area much of\r\nwhich is now being cultivated and most of it very fit for the production\r\nof cotton. The Sea of Ural has running into it two very large rivers,\r\nAmu Daria and the Syr Daria, and it is in the neighbourhood of these two\r\nrivers where we find by far the greatest weight of cotton of Turkestan\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nThere are four important areas, viz., Syr Daria, the centre of which is\r\nTashkend; Fergana, which lies between Samarcand and Bokhara; the\r\ndistrict of Samarcand itself; and Merv, which stands on the Overland\r\nRailway. It appears that many attempts were made to introduce cottons of\r\nvarious types into this locality, but most of the delicate species\r\nfailed. The Upland of America, however, survived, and has continued to\r\nsucceed, thanks to the valuable help which the Government gave in the\r\nway of instruction and distribution of free seed.\r\n\r\nThe first Government cotton plantation was commenced at Tashkend, one of\r\nthe termini of the Transcaspian Railway. Eight years ago there were\r\nupwards of a quarter of a million acres devoted to cotton cultivation.\r\n\r\nDuring the American War (that period which quickened all the\r\ncotton-growing centres of the Eastern Hemisphere) the production of\r\nfibre may be said to have commenced in earnest in Turkestan, and so late\r\nago as 1890 no less than forty-five and a half million pounds of good\r\nfibre were grown. Tashkend, it would appear, promises to hold its own,\r\nas it is determined to practise the best and most scientific methods in\r\nthe growth of cotton; in fact, in very few centres outside this\r\ndistrict, old and out of date operations are followed. Even in the\r\ndistricts of Fergana and Samarcand, the old wooden plough called a\r\n\"sokha\" is still in use.\r\n\r\nSeed, as in the case of India, is mostly sown broadcast, and very little\r\npreparing of the land is done. Yet, in spite of these deficiencies, good\r\ncrops are raised in many districts, capital soil and a most equable\r\nclimate making up for the shortcomings of the planter. The formation of\r\nthe Transcaspian Railway cannot but have an important influence upon the\r\ncotton-growing industry in Turkestan, running as it does through the\r\nvery heart of the best land in the country. It should be noted that\r\nBohkara annually produces over 50,000,000 pounds of cotton of the\r\nherbaceous type, and Khiva, another district lying still further east of\r\nthose already mentioned, over 20,000,000 pounds.\r\n\r\nLying between the Caspian Sea and Black Sea, lies another district named\r\nTranscaucasia, which yields large supplies of cotton. It has 100,000\r\nacres devoted to cotton, giving over 20,000,000 pounds per annum. North\r\nof Kokan, on the river Syr Daria, is a rising cotton district named\r\nKhojend, where annually 3,000,000 pounds of cotton of the American type\r\nare raised.\r\n\r\nWhen we consider that the quantity of cotton carried by the Transcaspian\r\nRailway since 1888 has more than quadrupled, and that in ten years the\r\nquantity shipped has been increased from quarter of a million pounds to\r\nover 72,000,000 pounds, we can quite appreciate the significance of the\r\nstatement that before long Russia will be able to grow all her own\r\ncotton for the medium and lower numbers of yarns.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cotton-growing in China, Corea and Japan.=--Japan, the land of the\r\nchrysanthemum, for many years now has been developing cotton-growing as\r\nwell as cotton manufacturing. From evidence which the cold type of the\r\nBoard of Trade gives, Japan bids fair to largely increase her trade with\r\nIndia to the disadvantage of the present suppliers.\r\n\r\nCotton-growing has been practised for some centuries in Japan, but it\r\nwas not until the seventeenth century that anything like progress could\r\nbe reported. From that time to the present the growth has been gradually\r\non the increase.\r\n\r\nJapan proper consists of the Islands of Niphon, Kiusiu, Shikoku, Yesso,\r\nand an immense number of smaller islands. Cotton cultivation is carried\r\non mainly on the first three islands named, and in the following\r\ndistricts:--San Indo, Wakayama, Osaka, Kuantoebene, Hitachi and Suo.\r\n\r\nTaken as a whole, the cotton grown in the best areas is good, though\r\nmuch of an inferior kind is produced. The most southerly area of\r\nWakayama in Niphon yields the best cotton of Japan.\r\n\r\nThe length of the fibre generally is much less than the herbaceous kind.\r\nAbout 10 per cent. of the entire arable land is now under cultivation\r\nfor cotton. As a rule, methods and processes are of a primitive kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cotton-growing in Corea.=--Lying directly to the west of Japan, this vast\r\npeninsula has of late years been developing its cotton-growing. Five\r\ncenturies ago cotton was imported from China, and one sees on every hand\r\nthe influence of the Celestials. The cultivated plant is of the\r\nperennial type, though it is planted annually, the old plants being dug\r\nup and burned, the ash being used as a fertiliser. Statistics at present\r\nare not to be relied upon, though it is supposed that something like\r\nthree quarters of a million acres are now under cultivation, giving on\r\nthe average about 250 pounds of cotton lint. As in the case of Japan\r\nvery little of this is exported, all of it or nearly so being spun and\r\nwoven at home on the most primitive of machines.\r\n\r\nThe chief districts engaged in growing cotton, nearly all of which lie\r\nin the southern portion of the peninsula, are Hwang-Hi, Kyeng-Sang,\r\nChel-La, Kyeng Kwi, and Chung Cheog.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cotton-growing in China.=--Owing to the great difficulty of obtaining any\r\nreliable statistical information, it is impossible to give anything\r\napproaching accuracy as to number of pounds of cotton produced annually,\r\nor number of acres devoted to the cultivation of the Cotton plant. This\r\nmuch, however, is known, that for many centuries cotton cultivating has\r\nbeen followed and that there has been within recent years a great\r\nincrease in the weight of the cotton crop as well as in the acreage. The\r\ntype of plant most generally cultivated is the herbaceous, and the\r\ncotton resulting is only poor in quality. Little or no preparation is\r\nmade before sowing seed, which is generally done broadcast. As a result\r\nthere is much overcrowding, and as is inevitable, there is produced a\r\nstubby plant with small bolls and much unripe cotton. On the terraces\r\nof the hillsides something approaching cultivation is pursued, with the\r\nresult of a better crop.\r\n\r\nUsually twenty weeks intervene between planting and picking, this latter\r\noperation being mostly the work of children and women. The old cotton\r\nstalks are afterward collected and dried for fuel.\r\n\r\nVery few large plantations exist in China, most of them being only a few\r\nacres in extent.\r\n\r\nBut little of the cotton grown at home is exported, most of it being\r\nspun and woven by women, though some of the fibre is sent to Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cultivation of Cotton in Egypt.=--It is now over thirty years since Sir\r\nSamuel Baker, the great African traveller, wrote these words: \"The Nile\r\nmight be so controlled that the enormous volume of water that now rushes\r\nuselessly into the Mediterranean might be led through the deserts, to\r\ntransform them into cotton fields that would render England independent\r\nof America.\"\r\n\r\nThe crop for the season 1900-01 was no less than 1,224,000 bales of 500\r\npounds each. Ten years ago only 868,000 acres were devoted to cotton\r\ncultivation as against 1,350,000 acres laid down to-day. Everything,\r\nthen, points to Sir Samuel Baker's statement becoming an actual fact\r\nmuch sooner than the famous traveller himself anticipated.\r\n\r\nEgypt enjoys many advantages over her competitors across the Atlantic.\r\nIn the first place, she can get almost twice as much cotton from the\r\nacre, so productive is the soil. Labour is cheaper, and the plant itself\r\nwhen young is not subject to the devastating frosts so often met with in\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nEgypt is divided into three great areas:--Lower Egypt, which includes\r\nthe whole of the Delta of the Nile; Upper Egypt; and Nubia. It is in the\r\nfirst-named district where the whole of Egyptian cotton is produced. At\r\nthe present time immense sums are being spent on irrigation and drainage\r\nworks, and as these are extended the areas devoted to cotton production\r\nwill greatly increase.\r\n\r\nAt the present time five distinct varieties of cotton are cultivated--\r\n\r\n     Mitafifi.          Bamia.\r\n     Abbasi.           Gallini.\r\n          Ashmouni-Hamouli.\r\n\r\nThe latter variety was originally known by a different name, Mako Jumel.\r\nFor a long time Ashmouni cotton was the principal fibre exported, but\r\nMitafifi is now in the front of all the other Egyptian cottons. A\r\nnoteworthy fact in connection with Ashmouni is, that its cultivation is\r\non the decline.\r\n\r\nSea Islands Gallini--as it was sometimes called--has practically ceased\r\nto be cultivated. Of Mitafifi and Bamia fibres, Mr. Handy, U. S. A.,\r\nsays: \"The Mitafifi was discovered by a Greek merchant in the village of\r\nthat name. The seed has a bluish tuft at the extremity, which attracted\r\nthe merchant's attention, and on planting it he found that it possessed\r\ndecided advantage over the old Ashmouni. It is more hardy, and yields a\r\ngreater proportion of lint to the seed. At first from 315 pounds of seed\r\ncotton, 112 pounds of lint was secured, and sometimes even more. It is\r\nnow somewhat deteriorated, and rarely yields so much, averaging about\r\n106 pounds of lint to 315 of seed cotton. The Mitafifi is a richer and\r\ndarker brown than the Ashmouni. The fibre is long, very strong, and fine\r\nto the touch, and is in great demand. In fact, it controls the market.\r\n\r\n\"Next to Mitafifi, Bamia is perhaps the most extensively cultivated\r\nvariety in Lower Egypt. It was discovered by a Copt in 1873. The plant\r\nis of large size and course growth. It is later and less hardy than\r\nMitafifi, and the fibre is poor as compared with that of Mitafifi and\r\nAbbasi, light and brown in colour, and not very strong. In general, it\r\nmay be said that this variety is inferior to Mitafifi in yield,\r\nhardiness and length and strength of fibre.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=Other places where Cotton is grown.=--In Africa, on the eastern and\r\nwestern coasts, large quantities of cotton are produced. The following\r\ncountries are specially suitable to the growth of cotton: Soudan,\r\nSenegambia, Congo River, Free States, and Liberia. Possibly, when these\r\ndistricts are more opened up to outside trade, and European capital and\r\nlabour are expended, abundant supplies of cotton fibre will be given.\r\n\r\nCotton is also grown in the East Indies, at Java, Sumatra, and Malay\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nIn the West Indies formerly, large supplies were yielded, but owing to\r\nthe cultivation of other crops that of cotton has steadily declined.\r\n\r\nGreece and Turkey both yield cotton which goes by the name of Levant\r\nCotton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE MICROSCOPE AND COTTON FIBRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis story would be very incomplete if some reference were not made to\r\nthe wonderful assistance which has been given to the study of cotton\r\nfibre by the microscope. As seen by its help, some striking\r\npeculiarities at once make themselves apparent. It is proposed, briefly,\r\nin this chapter, to do three things:\r\n\r\n     1. To describe the construction of a suitable instrument sufficient\r\n        for a complete examination of fibres in general.\r\n\r\n     2. To indicate the chief microscopic features of cotton fibres.\r\n\r\n     3. To show how to exactly measure the lengths and diameters of\r\n        fibres by means of micrometers.\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst, as to the instrument: a good substantial stand is desirable, one\r\nthat will not readily vibrate. The microscope shown in Fig. 6 is a cheap\r\nand commendable form, and good work can be done by this instrument,\r\nwhich is made by Ross, London. The stand carries the body-tube, and at\r\nthe lower end is placed the objective, so called, because the image of\r\nthe object (which rests upon the stage as shown) under examination is\r\nfirst focussed by it and conveyed along the body-tube.\r\n\r\nThe top end of the said tube contains the eye-piece, so named because by\r\nits aid the eye is allowed to receive the image duly focussed and\r\nenlarged.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, beginners work with one objective only, generally a one inch.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 6.--Microscope in position for drawing objects.\r\n\r\nA much higher power than this is necessary if the fibre in question is\r\nto be seen at its best, and for the purpose of this chapter a quarter\r\ninch objective will be used.\r\n\r\nUnderneath the stage, which is pierced by a circular aperture, is a\r\ndiaphragm. This regulates the quantity of light which is to be\r\ntransmitted by means of the silvered reflector shown in the\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, two reflectors are fixed in the same holder; one a concave\r\nmirror, the other a plane one. The former brings the rays of light to a\r\npoint or focus while the latter simply passes the beam of light along\r\njust as it received it, viz., as a parallel beam of light.\r\n\r\nIn examining fibres the concave mirror will be of most use. An ordinary\r\nlamp is usually good enough for the light required, the one figured\r\nbeing very suitable and having a tube-like arrangement of wick. Behind\r\nthe body-tube are two forms of adjustment, coarse and fine. The latter\r\nis worked by means of the milled screw, conical in shape, which is found\r\nimmediately behind the coarse adjustment. The operator is supposed to\r\nhave had some slight experience in the manipulation of the microscope.\r\nThe slide is now placed upon the stage. Fine Sea Islands cotton is\r\nmounted in Canada Balsam and protected by a small circular cover glass.\r\n\r\nNow rack down the body-tube by means of the coarse adjustment until\r\nwithin 1/16 of an inch of the cover-glass of the slide. Now see that the\r\nlight from the lamp is fully on the cotton strands. Rack up or down, as\r\nthe case may be, with the fine adjustment, and a wonderful sight meets\r\nthe eye, for the cotton viewed through the microscope is altogether\r\nunlike what we should expect it to be.\r\n\r\nRunning completely across the field are a number of strands, varying in\r\nthickness, form and natural twist. What is meant by natural twist is\r\nvery clearly shown in Fig. 7.\r\n\r\nMost people have seen india-rubber tubing or piping such as is used in\r\nthe chemical laboratory or that often found attached to feeding bottles.\r\nTake about a foot of this and hold one end firmly. Abstract the air by\r\nmeans of the mouth, and it will be found that immediately the air is\r\ntaken out the tube collapses. Now if the rubber be variable in\r\nthickness, here and there along these lines of least resistance will be\r\nfound certain twists, and it is the same kind of twists which can be so\r\ndistinctly seen as the cotton fibre is viewed through the microscope.\r\nThey are exceedingly irregular in number, on equal lengths of the same\r\nsingle fibre. When they run for some length, and are fairly regular, the\r\nedges appear like wavy lines or corrugations. It will now be seen by\r\nthe reader why these twists are so invaluable in spinning: locking and\r\nintertwining with each other, they materially assist the spinner in\r\nbuilding up a long and continuous thread.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 7.--Transverse and longitudinal sections of cotton fibre.\r\n\r\nThen, too, are to be seen lying close to the regularly twisted fibres a\r\nnumber of others which are very like ribbons, with here and there an\r\napology for a twist, and further, a careful scrutiny will be rewarded by\r\nfinding in what is reputedly the best cotton a number of filaments which\r\ndo not display any twists whatever and are very much like the round\r\ntubing referred to a little while ago. Others again are quite flat,\r\nwithout any distinguishing twists whatever. These are said to be the\r\nhalf-ripe and unripe fibres, and give much trouble later on (if worked\r\nup with good cotton) to the dyer and spinner.\r\n\r\nAs the slide containing the cotton is moved laterally, it will be seen\r\nthat this twisting of the fibre is continued for almost the whole\r\nlength, and as many as 300 twists have been counted on a single\r\nfilament. In some, the fibre tapers slightly, becoming more and more\r\ncylindrical as the end most remote from the seed is approached, until it\r\nis quite solid. These stiff ends soon disappear after the cotton has\r\nbeen treated in the early processes of manufacture. Thus there may be\r\nfound in almost every sample of cotton what are called ripe, half-ripe\r\nand unripe cotton. The last-named kind result from--\r\n\r\n     1. Gathering the crop before the boll is properly ripened and\r\n        matured.\r\n\r\n     2. Bad seasons; too much moisture and too little heat.\r\n\r\nThen again in the same boll all fibres do not ripen together just as all\r\napples on the same tree do not ripen together.\r\n\r\nImmature or unripe cotton cannot be dyed, and when small white specks\r\nare seen in any dyed fabric they are often due to the fact that unripe\r\ncotton has been used in the manufacture of the cloth.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Measurement of the Cotton Fibre.=--This is not at all a difficult matter,\r\nand the ordinary student may, by means of very simple and inexpensive\r\napparatus, obtain fairly satisfactory results in the measurement of\r\nfibres.\r\n\r\nThere is a choice of one of three methods, viz.:--\r\n\r\n    1. By having the mechanical stage so arranged that the slightest\r\n       displacement either to the left or right can be measured, and having\r\n       the eye-piece so marked (generally a hair stretched across it) that\r\n       when an object is to be measured, one side of it is made to coincide\r\n       with this central line and the stage rack is worked left or right\r\n       until the opposite side of the object is brought coincident with the\r\n       central line again; the amount of displacement can then be readily\r\n       obtained on referring to the graduated stage.\r\n\r\n    2. By having a stage micrometer and camera lucida.\r\n\r\n    3. By having two micrometers, a stage micrometer and eye-piece\r\n       micrometer.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis latter method is certainly the least expensive, and for all\r\npractical purposes can be safely recommended.\r\n\r\nA stage micrometer consists of a slip of glass 3\" × 1\" on which are\r\nmarked divisions of an inch, usually 1/100ths and 1/1000ths. As a rule\r\nthese markings are protected by means of a small cover-glass.\r\n\r\nEye-piece micrometers vary much in form, size and value, but the one\r\nwhich is here described is of the simplest type. It consists of two\r\ncircular pieces of glass carefully cemented together. On one of the\r\ninner surfaces are marked usually the 1/100ths divisions of an inch. In\r\nsome 1/200ths are marked. If the top lense of the eye-piece be\r\nunscrewed, a diaphragm will be found on which the eye-piece micrometer\r\nwill easily rest. Screw on the top lense again and, generally, the\r\neye-piece will be ready for use. If the micrometer is not properly in\r\nfocus after a few trials, it may easily be made right. In order, then,\r\nto measure the diameter of a single fibre of Sea Islands cotton, fit in\r\nthe quarter inch objective and place the stage micrometer in position\r\non the stage. First, focus the fine lines which are plainly to be seen,\r\nand remember the lines which are farthest apart are 1/100th of an inch;\r\nthe others 1/1000th of an inch.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, these lines run from N. to S. of the field; in other words,\r\nfrom top to bottom across the circles of light. Now look at the\r\ndivisions in the eye-piece micrometer, which are 1/100th of an inch\r\napart.\r\n\r\nIt will be found often that an exact number of these divisions fill up\r\none of the 1/100th divisions of the stage micrometer markings. If an\r\nexact number are not found, the draw-tube at the top end of the\r\nbody-tube should be withdrawn until an exact number is found to lie\r\nwithin two lines of the lower micrometer.\r\n\r\nSuppose twenty-two of the spaces on the eye-piece micrometer just cover\r\none of the divisions (1/100th of an inch) on the stage micrometer. Then\r\nit is clear that each division of the former represents 1/100 × 1/22 of\r\nan inch, or 1/2200th of an inch. For every fresh objective used, a fresh\r\nestimation of eye-piece and stage micrometer ratio is necessary. Having\r\nnow got in the eye-piece micrometer a unit of measurement, it becomes a\r\ncomparatively easy matter to measure the fibre.\r\n\r\nRemove the stage-micrometer and put a slide of Sea Islands cotton in its\r\nplace. Focus the fibre and observe the number of divisions or parts of a\r\ndivision covered by any particular fibre, and its measurement is at once\r\nknown. Thus if a single filament covers two of the divisions then it is\r\n2/2200th of an inch in diameter, or 1/1100th of an inch. Exactly the\r\nsame method is adopted if it is desired to measure the diameters of\r\nsections of the same fibres.\r\n\r\nThe making of the drawing of a fibre, either transverse or horizontal\r\nsection, is not at all a difficult matter.\r\n\r\nAll that is needed is what is known as a camera lucida. This consists of\r\na brass fixing for the eye-piece end of the body-tube and a small\r\nreflecting prism. This prism receives the image of the objective, and\r\nreflects it in this case at right angles downward on to a sheet of\r\npaper, which is placed beneath for the purpose of tracing the said\r\nimage.\r\n\r\nFocus the object, first having the microscope in a horizontal position.\r\nThis will not be a difficult matter. Now remove the cap which fits on\r\nthe eye-piece, and fix on the camera lucida as shown in the illustration\r\n(see Fig. 6). Adjust this until the image of the fibre is seen. Usually\r\none or two smoke-coloured glasses are fixed below the prism, and these\r\nare now brought into position so as to allow the image of the fibre to\r\npass through them. Place a sheet of drawing paper directly under the\r\ncamera lucida, sitting as shown in the illustration. After a few trials\r\nit will not be a difficult matter to follow the outline of the image by\r\nmeans of a black lead on the paper as is shown in the figure. In this\r\nway many useful working drawings can be made, and a little careful\r\ncalculation will give the amplification of the drawing after it is\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nPLANTATION LIFE AND THE EARLY CLEANING PROCESSES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter many months of anxious watching and waiting, towards the end of\r\nJuly or early in August, the planter may be seen to be constantly and\r\nwistfully looking for the appearance of the bursting bolls of cotton.\r\nDaily in the early mornings he is to be seen casting his eyes down the\r\npod-laden rows of cotton plants, to see if he can count a few ripe open\r\nbolls as he stands at the head of a row. If this be so, he knows that\r\nhis harvest is close at hand, and his pickers must be ready at any\r\nmoment to begin what is certainly the most tedious and difficult work of\r\nthe plantation, namely, picking the raw cotton from the bursting bolls.\r\n\r\nWhile the planter has been on the lookout in the fields, necessary and\r\nimportant operations have been going on inside in the farm outbuildings.\r\nSacks and baskets which can most expeditiously aid in the removal of the\r\npicked cotton from the field to the ginning factory are being got ready.\r\nTo suit the young and old, tall and small, weak and strong, different\r\nsized bags and baskets are required, and after the marking and branding\r\nof the same, they are ready for being put into use.\r\n\r\nNow the picking of cotton is not at all an easy operation, long\r\ncontinuous bending, a hot sun (for it is a rule scarcely ever broken\r\nthat cotton must not be plucked unless the sun is shining upon it), a\r\nconstantly increasing weight round the neck or on the arm, monotonous\r\npicking of the cotton from the bolls without bringing away any of the\r\nhusk or leaf--all tend to make the work of the picker very trying and\r\ntiresome. The plantation hands must be early at work, and while the day\r\nis very young they are to be seen wending their way, ready to begin when\r\nthe sun makes its appearance. Often the clothes of the workers are quite\r\nwet with the early morning dews. This is specially the case in September\r\nand October. By ten o'clock a hot blazing sun streams down upon the\r\npickers as they diligently relieve the heavy-laden bushes of the white\r\nfleecy load of cotton. As each picker fills his or her bag, it is\r\nquickly emptied into a larger receptacle, and ultimately carried away to\r\nthe gin house, where it is desirable the cotton should be housed before\r\nthe night dews come on and consequently damage materially the cotton\r\nwhich the pickers have been careful to pick while the sun was on it.\r\n\r\nMr. Lyman, in his book on the Cotton Culture in the States, says: \"It\r\nseems like very easy work to gather a material which shows itself in\r\nsuch abundance as fairly to whiten the field, but let the sceptic or the\r\ngrumbler take a bag on his shoulders and start in between a couple of\r\nrows. He will find upon taking hold of the first boll that the fibres\r\nare quite firmly attached to the interior lining of the pod, and if he\r\nmakes a quick snatch, thinking to gather the entire lock, he will only\r\ntear it in two, or leave considerable adhering to the pod. And yet he\r\nmay notice that an experienced picker will gather the cotton and lay his\r\nfingers into the middle of the open pod with a certain expertness which\r\nonly practice gives, the effect of which is to clear the whole pod with\r\none movement of the hand.\"\r\n\r\nKnowing how intensely monotonous and dreary the work of cotton picking\r\nis, Mr. Lyman advises the planters to allow a very fair amount of\r\nliberty so far as merrymaking is concerned, and he says on this point\r\nthat \"though too much talking and singing must interfere with labour, it\r\nis earnestly recommended to every cotton grower to take care to secure\r\ncheerfulness if not hilarity in the field. Remember that it is a very\r\nsevere strain upon the patience and spirits of any one, to be urged to\r\nrapid labour of precisely the same description day by day, week by week,\r\nmonth by month. Let there be refreshments at the baskets, a dish of hot\r\ncoffee in a cool morning, or a pail of buttermilk in a hot afternoon, or\r\na tub of sweetened water, or a basket of apples.\"\r\n\r\nAs a rule the cotton gathered on one farm, which has, generally\r\nspeaking, had something like uniformity in method of cultivation, will\r\nproduce cotton varying very little in quality and weight.\r\n\r\nHence on large farms there will be something like uniform quality of\r\ncotton produced. It will, however, be clear to the general reader that\r\non the small farms of India, say where sufficient cannot be gathered on\r\none farm, or perhaps on a few farms, to make one bale, there will not be\r\nthat uniformity which is desirable, hence Indian cotton, especially of\r\nthe poorer types, varies a great deal more than the American varieties.\r\nWhen the hands have gathered sufficient to fill the carts drawn in\r\nAmerica usually by mules, and in India by oxen, the cotton is taken to\r\nhouses in which the seeds are separated from the fibre. This process is\r\ncalled \"ginning.\"\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing to find how tenaciously the fibres cling to the seed\r\nwhen an attempt is made to separate them. At first much loss was\r\noccasioned because of the brutal methods employed, and now even with\r\nvery much more perfect machinery a good deal of the cotton fibre is\r\ninjured in the ginning process.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 8.--Indian women with roller gin.\r\n\r\nAt present, most of the cotton produced in various parts of the world is\r\nginned by machinery, though in India and China foot gins and other\r\nprimitive types are still employed.\r\n\r\nIt should be stated that where a large production of cotton is desired\r\nthe foot gin or even what is known as the \"Churka gin\" (which consists\r\nof a couple of rollers turned by hand) is never employed. Only a few\r\npounds a day of cotton can be separated from the seeds when this method\r\nis adopted.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a lecture by the late Sir Benjamin Dobson\r\nwill be of interest here, as showing what is done at an American\r\nginnery:\r\n\r\n\"The farmer brings the cotton to the mill in a waggon, with mules or\r\noxen attached; the cotton is weighed, and then thrown out of the waggon\r\ninto a hopper alongside. From this hopper it is taken by an elevator, or\r\nlift, either pneumatic or mechanical, and raised to the third story of\r\nthe ginning factory. There it is delivered into another part of the room\r\nuntil required. When the cotton is to be ginned it is brought by rakes\r\nalong the floor to an open sort of hopper or trunk, and from here\r\nconveyed to the gins below by travelling lattices.\r\n\r\n\"In the factory of which I am speaking there were six gins, all of them\r\nsaw-gins. Each gin was provided with a hopper of its own, and the\r\nattendant, when any hopper was full, could either divert the feed to\r\nsome other gin, as he required, or stop it altogether. The gins produced\r\nfrom 300 pounds to 350 pounds per hour. The cotton is dropped from the\r\ncondenser, in front of the gin, upon the floor close to the baling\r\npress, into which it is raked by the attendant and baled loosely, but\r\nonly temporarily. The seed falls into a travelling lattice, and is\r\nconducted to a straight cylindrical tube, in which works a screw. This\r\ntakes it some one hundred yards to the oil mill. There the seed is\r\ndropped into what are known as 'linting' machines, and as much as\r\npossible of the lint or fibre left upon the seed is removed.\r\n\r\n\"These linting machines--practically another sort of gin--deliver the\r\ncotton or waste in a kind of roll, which is straightway put behind a\r\ncarding engine. Coming out of the carding engine it is made into\r\nwadding by pasting it on cardboard paper, for filling in quilts,\r\npetticoats, and for other purposes. When the seed has passed the linting\r\nmachine, it is taken, still by a lattice, to a hulling machine. This\r\nmachine will take off the outside shell, which is passed to one side,\r\nwhile the green kernel of the seed goes down a shoot. The seed fills\r\ncertain receptacles placed in the oil press, and is submitted to a\r\nhydraulic press. The result is a clear and sweet oil, which I am\r\ncredibly informed is sold in England and other countries under the name\r\nof 'olive oil.' The remains of the green kernel are then pressed into\r\nwhat are termed cattle cakes, or oil cakes, for feeding cattle.\"\r\n\r\nBut the reader is probably asking, what is a gin like?\r\n\r\nThe illustration seen in Fig. 9 is a gin which goes by the name of the\r\n\"single-acting Macarthy gin,\" so called because it has only one\r\noscillating blade for removing the fibre from the seed. The back of the\r\nmachine is shown in the figure. This process at the best is a brutal\r\none, especially when certain gins are employed, but the one figured here\r\nis considered to do little damage to the fibre when extracting the seed.\r\n\r\nThe gin shown in Fig. 9 is of simple construction, consisting of a large\r\nleather roller about 40 inches in length and 5 in diameter. \"The roller\r\nis built up by means of solid washers, or in strips fastened on to wood,\r\nagainst which is pressed a doctor knife.\r\n\r\n\"The cotton is thrown into a hopper, and, falling, is seized by the\r\nfriction of the leather and drawn between the doctor knife and the\r\nleather surface. Whilst this is taking place, there is a beater knife\r\nwhich is reciprocated at a considerable speed and which strikes the seed\r\nattached to the cotton drawn away by the leather roller. The detached\r\nseed will then fall through a grid provided for the purpose. A\r\nsingle-action gin should produce about 30 pounds of cleaned cotton per\r\nhour.\"\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 9.--Single-acting Macarthy gin.\r\n\r\nAnother gin which does considerable damage to fibre, especially if it be\r\nover-fed, is still in use in the States. This was the invention of an\r\nAmerican named Eli Whitney, and has been named a \"saw-gin.\"\r\n\r\nIf the reader can imagine a number of circular saws (such as are to be\r\nseen in a wood-sawing mill) placed nearly together on a shaft to form an\r\nalmost continuous roller, he will have a good idea of what the chief\r\npart of a saw-gin is like.\r\n\r\nAs the cotton is fed to the machine, the saws seize it and strip the\r\ncotton from the seeds, which fall through grids placed below the saws.\r\nThe cotton is afterward stripped from the saws themselves by means of a\r\nquickly revolving brush which turns in the opposite direction to the\r\nsaws. This gin is best suited to short stapled cottons, especially such\r\nas are grown in the States. For the longer fibred cotton this gin is not\r\nwell adapted, much injury resulting to the cotton treated by it.\r\n\r\nAfter the cotton is ginned, it is gathered into bundles and roughly\r\nbaled. When a sufficient quantity has been so treated, it is carried to\r\nthe \"compressors,\" where the cotton undergoes great reduction in bulk as\r\na result of the enormous pressure to which it is subjected.\r\n\r\nFor the general reader it will scarcely be necessary or wise to describe\r\na \"cotton press\" in detail. Let it suffice to say that by means of a\r\nseries of levers--in the Morse Press seven are used--tremendous pressure\r\ncan be obtained. Thus for every 1 pound pressure of steam generated\r\nthere will be seven times that pressure, if seven levers are used. When\r\n200 pounds pressure of steam is up, there will be 1400 pounds pressure\r\nper inch on the cotton. So great is the pressure exerted that a bundle\r\nof cotton coming to the press from the ginnery, 4 feet in depth, is\r\nreduced to 7 inches when drawn from the compressor. While in the press\r\niron bands are put round the cotton, and readers will have frequently\r\nseen cotton on its way to the mills having these iron bands round it.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the number of bands which are found on bales\r\ncoming to England from cotton-growing countries:--\r\n\r\n                            No. of bands.

In the \"Round Bale\" Circular of the American Cotton\r\nCompany, it is stated that from the 21st November, 1896, to January\r\n2nd, 1897, no less than 1443 round bales were turned out of the factory\r\nat Waco in Texas. The total weight of these bales was 614,832 pounds,\r\ngiving an average of 426 pounds per bale.\r\n\r\nBy means of a press the cotton is rolled into the form as shown in the\r\nillustration. The press makes a bale 4 feet long and 2 feet in diameter\r\nand weighs over 35 pounds per cubic foot or 50 per cent. denser than the\r\nbale made under the system as shown in Fig. 10.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 11.--Cylindrical rolls of cotton.\r\n\r\nIt is claimed for this new system that the regularity of the size of the\r\nbale, 4 x 2 feet, makes it pack much closer than the irregular\r\nturtle-backed bales as usually made on the old system.\r\n\r\nUnder the new style the cotton is pressed gradually and not all at once.\r\nFor this reason it is claimed that the fibre is not injured and the\r\ncotton arrives at the mill with the fibre in as good condition as when\r\nit left the gins.\r\n\r\n\"Bagging and ties are entirely dispensed with, as the air is pressed out\r\nof the cotton and it has no tendency to expand again, and the covering\r\nneeded is only sufficient to keep the cotton clean.\"\r\n\r\nFrom a number of experiments it is proved that the \"round bale\" is both\r\nfireproof and water proof.\r\n\r\nFrom the illustration of the round bale shown in Fig. 11, it will be\r\nseen how readily this new form of bale lends itself to greatly aiding\r\nthe operatives in the opening processes in the mill. The roll which lies\r\non the floor like a roll of carpet could be so fixed that the cotton\r\ncould be fed to the opener by being unrolled as shown in the\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\nAt present the round bale system is not popular and it remains to be\r\nseen whether it will commend itself to cotton spinners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nMANIPULATION OF COTTON IN OPENING, SCUTCHING, CARDING, DRAWING, AND\r\nFLY-FRAME MACHINES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to give the readers of this story an insight into the\r\nvarious operations through which cotton is made to pass, it may be\r\nadvisable to briefly enumerate them first.\r\n\r\nOn the field there are the operations of collecting and ginning, that\r\nis, separating the raw cotton from the seeds. To the stranger it is very\r\nastonishing that as many as 66 to 75 pounds of seed are got from every\r\n100 pounds of seed cotton gathered. Then in or near the cotton field\r\nthe process of baling is carried out. Thus there are collecting, ginning\r\nand baling, as preliminary processes.\r\n\r\nWhen the cotton arrives in bales at the mill (see Fig. 10), in which it\r\nis to be cleaned, opened and spun, it is first weighed and a record\r\nkept.\r\n\r\nIn the mill the first real operation is the taking of quantities of\r\ncotton from different bales of cotton from various countries, or\r\ndifferent grades from the same country, and \"mixing\" so as to secure a\r\ngreater uniformity in the quality of the yarn produced. In this process\r\nit is now the common practice to use a machine termed the \"Bale\r\nBreaker,\" or \"Cotton Puller.\"\r\n\r\nThe second important process carried out in the mill is \"opening.\" By\r\nthis the matted masses of cotton fibres are to a great extent opened\r\nout, and a large percentage of the heavy impurities, such as sand,\r\nshell, and leaf, fall out by their own weight. It is now also usual at\r\nthis stage to form the cotton into a large roll or sheet called the\r\n\"lap.\"\r\n\r\nImmediately following the \"opening\" comes \"scutching,\" which is merely a\r\ncontinuation of the work performed by the \"opener,\" but done in such a\r\nway that greater attention is bestowed upon the production of an even\r\nsheet or \"lap\" of cotton.\r\n\r\nThe cotton at this stage is practically in the same condition as it was\r\nwhen first gathered from the tree in the plantation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Carding= comes next in order, and it should be observed that this is one\r\nof the most beautiful and instructive operations carried on in the\r\nmill.\r\n\r\nThe process of opening out the cotton is continued in this operation to\r\nsuch an extent that the fibres are practically _individually separated_,\r\nand while in this condition very fine impurities are removed, and many\r\nof the short and unripe fibres which are always more or less present are\r\nremoved. Before leaving the machine the fibres are gathered together\r\nagain in a most wonderful manner and converted into a \"sliver,\" which\r\nfor all the world looks like a rope of cotton, a little less than an\r\ninch in diameter.\r\n\r\nIn most mills \"drawing\" succeeds \"carding,\" this operation having for\r\nits object (1) the doubling together of four to eight slivers from the\r\ncard and attenuating them to the dimension of one so as to secure\r\ngreater uniformity in diameter. (2) The reduction of the crossed and\r\nentangled fibres from the card into parallel or side by side order.\r\n\r\nAfter \"drawing,\" the cotton is brought to and sent through a series of\r\nmachines termed \"Bobbin and Fly Frames.\" There are usually three of\r\nthese machines for the cotton to pass through, to which are given the\r\nnames of \"Slubbing,\" \"Intermediate,\" and \"Roving\" Frames.\r\n\r\nTheir duties are to carry on the operation of making the sliver of\r\ncotton finer or thinner until it is ready for the final process of\r\nspinning, and incidentally to add to the uniformity and cleanliness of\r\nthe thread of cotton.\r\n\r\nThe final process of spinning is chiefly performed on one of two\r\nmachines, the \"Mule\" and the \"Ring Frame,\" either of which makes a\r\nthread largely used without further treatment in a spinning mill.\r\n\r\nSometimes, however, the thread is further treated by such operations as\r\ndoubling, reeling, gassing, etc. It should be added that in the\r\nproduction of the finest and best yarns an important process is gone\r\nthrough, named \"combing.\"\r\n\r\nThis may be defined as a continuation of the carding process already\r\nnamed before to a much more perfect degree. The chief object is to\r\nextract all fibres below a certain required length, and reject them as\r\nwaste. There is as much of this latter made at this stage of manufacture\r\nas that made by all the other machines put together, that is, about 17\r\nper cent. Of course it will be readily seen that this is a costly\r\noperation and is limited entirely to the production of the very best and\r\nfinest yarns.\r\n\r\nThis process necessitates the employment of a machine called a \"Sliver\r\nLap\" and sometimes a \"Ribbon Lap Machine\" in order to put the slivers\r\nfrom the carding engine into a small lap suitable for the \"creel\" of the\r\n\"Combing Machine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cotton Mixing and the Bale Breaker.=--As before stated, the first\r\noperation in the mill is the opening out of bales of raw material and\r\nmaking a \"mixing.\" Of course the weight of the bale is ascertained\r\nbefore it is opened.\r\n\r\nAll varieties of cotton vary in their commercial properties, this\r\nvariation being due to a number of causes. From a commercial value point\r\nof view, there is an enormous difference between the very best and the\r\nvery worst cottons; so much so, indeed, that they are never blended\r\ntogether. Between these two extremes there is a well-graded number of\r\nvarieties and classifications of cotton, and some approximate so closely\r\nto others in quality, that they are often blended together in the\r\n\"mixing.\"\r\n\r\nFurther than this, the same class of cotton often varies in spinning\r\nqualities from a number of circumstances that need not here be named.\r\nThis is, however, an additional reason why cotton from various bales\r\nshould be blended together in order to secure uniformity.\r\n\r\nA cotton \"mixing\" may be described as a kind of \"stack,\" resembling\r\nsomewhat the haystack of the farm yards.\r\n\r\nThe method usually pursued in making this mixing is somewhat as\r\nfollows:--A portion of cotton from a certain bale is taken off and\r\nspread over a given area of floor space. Then a similar portion from\r\nanother bale is placed over the first layer already lying on the floor.\r\n\r\nThe same operation is followed with a third and fourth layer from\r\ndifferent bales, and so on with as many bales as the management consider\r\nthere are variations in quality, the larger the mixing the better for\r\nsecuring uniformity of yarn.\r\n\r\nWhen it is desired to use the cotton, it should be pulled down\r\nvertically from the face of the \"mixing,\" so as to secure a fair portion\r\nfrom each bale composing the mixture. Before spreading the cotton out it\r\nis usually pulled into pieces of moderate size by the hands of the\r\noperative.\r\n\r\nDuring recent years it has become the very general practice to use a\r\nsmall machine called the \"Bale Breaker\" or \"Cotton Puller,\" and to have\r\nalso working in conjunction with this machine long travelling \"lattices\"\r\ncalled \"mixing lattices.\" These perform the operation of \"pulling\" and\r\n\"mixing\" the cotton much more quickly and effectively than by hand\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\nThe \"Cotton Puller\" or \"Bale Breaker\" (see Fig. 12) simply consists, in\r\nits most useful form, of four pairs of coarsely fluted or spiked\r\nrollers of about 6 inches diameter with a feed apron or lattice such as\r\nis shown in the illustration.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 12.--Bale breaker or puller.\r\n\r\nThe method adopted with the \"Bale Breaker\" and \"mixing lattices\" in use\r\nis as follows:--\r\n\r\nThe various bales of cotton intended for \"mixing\" are placed very near\r\nto the feed apron of the Bale Breaker, and a layer from each bale in\r\nsuccession is placed on the apron. The latter feeds the cotton at a slow\r\nrate to the revolving rollers of the machine, and as each pair of top\r\nand bottom rollers that the cotton meets is revolving more rapidly than\r\nthe preceding pair, the result is a pulling asunder of the cotton by the\r\nrollers, into much smaller pieces, quite suitable for the next machine.\r\nThe Bale Breaker delivers the cotton upon long travelling aprons of\r\nlattice work, which carry the cotton away and deposit it upon any\r\ndesired portion of the floor to form the \"mixing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=Opening.=--The name of the next process, viz., \"opening,\" has been given\r\nit because its primary function is \"to open\" out the cotton to such an\r\nextent that the greater bulk of the seed, leaf, sand, and dust is\r\nreadily extracted. The details of this machine and indeed practically of\r\nall machines used in cotton spinning, vary so much with different\r\nmakers, that it would be utterly out of place to deal with them here, so\r\nthat it may be said at once, that all such points are entirely omitted\r\nfrom this treatment of the subject.\r\n\r\nThe essential and principal portions of the machines are practically\r\nidentical for all makers, and it is with these only that it is proposed\r\nto deal, taking in all cases the best present-day practice.\r\n\r\nThe opener, then, is a very powerful machine, being in fact the most\r\npowerful used in cotton spinning, and the most important feature of the\r\nmachine is the employment of a strong beater, to which is fitted a large\r\nnumber of iron or steel knives or spikes. These beat down the cotton and\r\nopen it at a terrific rate, the beater having a surface speed of perhaps\r\n4000 feet a minute. Various fans, rollers, and other parts are employed\r\nto feed the cotton to the beater, and to take it away again after\r\ntreatment. It will perhaps best serve the purpose of our readers if the\r\npassage of the cotton be described through an opener of the most modern\r\nand approved construction, dealing with the subject in non-technical\r\nterms.\r\n\r\nWith this object in view, take for example what is termed \"The Double\r\nCotton Opener\" with \"Hopper Feed Attachment.\" This machine is shown in\r\nFig. 13.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 13.--\"Double opener\" with \"hopper feed.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hopper Feed is about the most recent improvement of any magnitude\r\ngenerally adopted in cotton spinning mills. It is an attachment to the\r\ninitial or feed end of an opener with the object of feeding the cotton\r\nmore cheaply and effectively than it can be done by hand.\r\n\r\nIt may be said to consist of a large iron feed box, into which the\r\ncotton is passed in considerable quantities at one time. At the bottom\r\nof the feed box, or hopper, is a travelling apron which carries the\r\ncotton forward, so as to be brought within the action of steel pins in\r\nan inclined travelling apron or lattice. This latter carries the cotton\r\nupwards, and special mechanism is provided in the shape of what is\r\ntermed an \"Evener roller,\" to prevent too much cotton going forward at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nThe cotton that passes over the top of the inclined lattice or apron is\r\nstripped off by what is denominated the stripping roller, and is then\r\ndeposited on the feed apron of the opener, where formerly it was placed\r\nby hand.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that one man can feed two machines with Hopper Feeds as\r\nagainst one without them, and in the best makes the work is done more\r\neffectively.\r\n\r\nThe feed lattice of the opener carries the cotton along to the feed\r\nrollers, which project it forward into the path of the large beater. It\r\nis here that the opening and cleaning actions are chiefly performed.\r\n\r\nThe strong knives or spikes of the beater break the cotton into very\r\nsmall portions indeed, and dash it against \"cleaning bars\" or \"grate\r\nbars\" specially arranged and constructed. Through the interstices of\r\nthese bars much of the now loosened seed and dirt present in the cotton\r\npasses into a suitable receptacle, which is afterward cleaned out at\r\nregular intervals.\r\n\r\nThe opened and cleaned cotton is taken away from the action of the\r\nbeater by an air current produced by a powerful fan. This latter creates\r\na partial vacuum in the beater chamber by blowing the air out of certain\r\nair exit trunks specially provided. To supply this partial vacuum\r\nafresh, air can only be obtained from the beater chamber, and the air\r\ncurrent thus induced, takes the cotton along with it, and deposits it in\r\nthe form of a sheet upon what are termed \"cages\" or \"sieve cylinders.\"\r\n\r\nThese are hollow cylinders of iron or zinc perforated with a very large\r\nnumber of small holes through which the air rushes, leaving the cotton,\r\nas it were, plastered on the outer surfaces of the cages.\r\n\r\nIt is usual to have a pair of these cages, working one over the other\r\nlike the pair of rollers in a wringing machine.\r\n\r\nThe cotton now passes between two pairs of small guide rollers, and is\r\nfed by the second pair to a second beater, but of very different\r\nconstruction from the first one.\r\n\r\nThis consists of two or three iron or steel blades extending the full\r\nwidth of the machine and carried by specially constructed arms from a\r\nstrong central shaft.\r\n\r\nThe edges of these beater blades are made somewhat sharp, and they\r\nstrike down the cotton from the feed roller at the rate of 2000 or more\r\nblows per minute.\r\n\r\nThis of course carries the opening work of the cotton of the first\r\nbeater to a still further degree, and as in this case the cotton is also\r\nstruck down upon \"beater bars\" or cleaning bars, a further quantity of\r\nloosened impurities passes through the bars. As before, another powerful\r\nfan creates an air current by which the cotton is carried away from the\r\nbeater and placed upon a pair of \"Cages.\" From this point the cotton is\r\nconducted in the form of a sheet between four heavy calender or\r\ncompression rollers, the rollers being superimposed over each other, and\r\nthe cotton receiving three compressions in its passage.\r\n\r\nThis makes a much more solid and tractable sheet of cotton, and it is\r\nnow simply wound upon an iron roller in the form of a roll of cotton\r\ntermed a \"lap,\" being now ready for the subsequent process, as shown in\r\nthe illustration (Fig. 14).\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 14.--Scutching machine with \"lap\" at the back.\r\n\r\n=Scutching.=--This term obviously means beating, and the process itself is\r\nsimply a repetition of the opening and cleaning properties of the\r\nopener, these objects being attained to a greater degree of perfection.\r\nFor the best classes of cotton it is often deemed sufficient to pass it\r\nthrough the opener alone, and then to immediately transfer the lap to\r\nthe process of carding. For some cottons it is the practice to pass the\r\ncotton through two scutchers in addition to the opener, while in other\r\ncases it is the practice to use one scutcher only in addition to the\r\nopener.\r\n\r\nIn the scutcher it is the most common practice to take four laps from\r\nthe opener and to place them in a specially constructed creel and\r\nresting on a travelling \"lattice\" or apron. By this they are slowly\r\nunwound and the four sheets are laid one upon another and passed in one\r\ncombined sheet, through feed rollers, to a two or three bladed beater,\r\nexactly like the second one described when treating upon the double\r\nopener. Also, exactly in the same manner, a lap is formed ready for the\r\nimmediately succeeding process of carding. In the scutcher the doubling\r\nof four laps together tends to produce a sheet of cotton more uniform in\r\nthickness and weight than that from the opener. This object of equality\r\nof lap is also invariably aided by what are termed Automatic Feed\r\nRegulators, which regulate the weight of cotton given to the beater to\r\nsomething like a continuous uniformity. The action is clearly seen in\r\nthe illustration.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Carding.=--By many persons this is deemed to be the most important\r\noperation in cotton spinning. Its several duties may be stated as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n     1. The removal of a large proportion of any impurities, such as\r\n        broken leaf, seed and shell, that may have escaped the previous\r\n        processes. It may usually be deemed to be the final process of\r\n        cleansing.\r\n\r\n     2. To open out and disentangle the clusters of fibres into even\r\n        greater individualisation than existed when first picked, and to\r\n        leave them in such condition that the subsequent operations can\r\n        easily draw them out, and reduce them to parallel order.\r\n\r\n     3. The extraction of a good proportion of the short, broken and\r\n        unripe fibres, present more or less in all cottons grown, and\r\n        practically worthless from a manufacturing point of view.\r\n\r\n     4. The reduction of the heavy sheet or lap of cotton from the\r\n        scutcher, into a comparatively light and thin sliver. Ordinarily,\r\n        one yard of the lap put up behind the card weighs more than 100\r\n        times as heavy as the sliver delivered at the front of the card.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several varieties of Carding Engine, but in each case nearly\r\nall the essential features are practically the same in one card as in\r\nanother. At the present time, the type of Carding Engine which has\r\npractically superseded all others is denominated the \"Revolving Flat\r\nCard.\" This Card originated with Mr. Evan Leigh, of Manchester, and\r\nafter being in close competition with several other types has almost\r\ndriven them out of the market. Of course it has been considerably\r\nimproved by later inventors, and various machine makers have their own\r\ntechnical peculiarities.\r\n\r\nIn the illustration seen in Fig. 15 there is conveyed an excellent idea\r\nof the appearance of the heavy lap of cotton as it is placed behind the\r\nCarding Engine, and of the manner in which the same cotton appears as a\r\n\"sliver\" or soft strand of cotton as it issues from the front of the\r\nsame machine, and enters the cylindrical can into which it is passed,\r\nand coiled into compact layers, suitable for withdrawal at the\r\nimmediately succeeding process.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 15.--Two views of the carding engine: upper view, cotton\r\n                 entering; lower view, cotton leaving.\r\n\r\nIn the main, the parts which operate upon the cotton fibres in their\r\npassage through this machine consist of a number of cylinders or rollers\r\nof various diameters, but practically equal in width. Some of these\r\nrollers are merely to guide and conduct the cotton forward, but the more\r\nimportant are literally bristling all over with a vast number of closely\r\nset and finely drawn steel wire teeth, whose duty it is to open, and\r\ncomb out, and clean the fibers as they pass along.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the \"lap\" or roll of cotton is placed behind the machine\r\nso as to rest on a roller of 6 inches in diameter, which slowly unwinds\r\nthe lap at the rate of about 9 inches per minute, by frictional contact\r\ntherewith.\r\n\r\nHere, it may be said that the width of this and other chief rollers and\r\ncylindrical parts of the card may be about 38 inches or 40 inches wide,\r\nthere being a tendency to make present-day Carding Engines rather\r\nnarrower than formerly, in order to give greater strength to certain\r\nparts. From the lap roller the sheet of cotton is conducted for about 8\r\ninches over a smooth feed plate, and then it goes underneath a fluted\r\nroller of 2-1/4 inches diameter, termed the feed roller, having\r\npractically the same surface speed as the lap roller, or possibly a\r\nsmall fraction more to keep the cotton lap tight.\r\n\r\nAt this stage the actual work of the Carding Engine may be said to\r\ncommence. While the feed roller and the feed plate hold the end of the\r\nsheet of cotton and project it forward at the slow rate of 8 or 9 inches\r\nper minute, this projecting end of the lap becomes subject to the action\r\nof a powerful roller or beater termed the taker-in or licker-in.\r\n\r\nThe most recent and improved construction of this roller is termed the\r\nMetallic Taker-in, and it is covered all over with strong steel teeth\r\nshaped something like those of a saw. It is about 9 inches in diameter,\r\nand its strong teeth strike the cotton down from the feed roller with a\r\nsurface speed of nearly 1000 feet per minute.\r\n\r\nIt is at this stage that the bulk of the heavier impurities still found\r\nin the cotton are removed, as these fall through certain grids below the\r\ntaker-in immediately they are loosened from the retaining fibres by the\r\npowerful teeth of the taker-in.\r\n\r\nThe great bulk of the cotton fibres, however, are retained by the teeth\r\nof the taker-in and carried round the under side to a point where they\r\nare exposed to the action of the central and most important part of\r\nevery Carding Engine, viz., the main \"cylinder.\" The licker-in contains\r\nabout twenty-eight teeth per square inch, but the \"cylinder\" is the\r\nfirst of the parts that the cotton arrives at, previously referred to as\r\nbeing covered with a vast number of closely set steel wire teeth.\r\n\r\nJust to convey an idea of this point to the uninitiated reader, it may\r\nbe said that it is quite common to have on the \"cylinder\" as many as 600\r\nsteel wire teeth in one square inch. For a cylinder 40 inches wide and\r\n50 inches diameter, this works out to the vast number of over 3,800,000\r\nsteel wire teeth on one cylinder, each tooth being about 1/4 inch long,\r\nand secured in a cloth or rubber foundation before the latter is wound\r\nround the cylinder.\r\n\r\nThe steel teeth of the cylinder strip the fibres from the taker-in and\r\ncarry them in an upward direction, the surface speed of the cylinder\r\nbeing over 2000 feet per minute.\r\n\r\nPlaced over the cylinder, and extending for nearly one-half of its\r\ncircumference, are what are technically known as the \"flats.\"\r\n\r\nThese are narrow iron bars, each about 1-3/8 inches wide; each being\r\ncovered with steel wire teeth in the same manner as the cylinder; and\r\neach extending right across the width of the cylinder, and resting on a\r\nsuitable bearing termed the \"bend.\"\r\n\r\nThey are formed into an endless chain containing about 108 \"flats,\" but\r\nonly about 44 of which are in actual work at one time; this endless\r\nchain of flats being given a slow movement of about 3 inches per minute.\r\n\r\nHere it may be said that the various working parts are set as close as\r\npossible to each other without being in actual contact, the usual\r\ndistance being about 1/143rd of an inch determined by a specially\r\nconstructed gauge, in the hands of a skilled workman.\r\n\r\nThe steel teeth of the flats, being set very close to those of the\r\ncylinder, catch hold of and retain a portion of the short warty fibres\r\nand fine impurities that may be on the points of the cylinder teeth, the\r\namount of this reaching about 3 per cent. of the cotton passed through\r\nthe machine. In addition to this the teeth of the flats work against\r\nthose of the cylinder so as to exercise a combing action on the cotton\r\nfibres.\r\n\r\nHaving passed the \"flats,\" the cotton is deposited by the cylinder on\r\nwhat is termed the doffer. This is a cylindrical body, exactly similar\r\nto the main \"cylinder\" excepting that it is only about half the\r\ndiameter, say 24 inches. Its steel wire teeth are set in the opposite\r\nway to those of the cylinder, and its surface speed is only about 75\r\nfeet per minute. These two circumstances acting together enable it to\r\ntake the cotton fibres from the main cylinder.\r\n\r\nThe operations of carding may now be said to be practically performed,\r\nas the remaining operations have for their object the stripping,\r\ncollecting, and guiding of the cotton into a form suitable for the next\r\nsucceeding processes. The fleece of cotton is stripped from the doffer\r\nby the \"Doffer Comb,\" which is a thin bar of steel, having a serrated\r\nunder edge, and making about 1600 beats or strokes per minute. From this\r\npoint cotton is collected into the form of a loose rope or \"sliver,\" and\r\npassed first through a trumpet-shaped mouth, and then through a pair of\r\ncalender rollers about six inches wide and four inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 16.--Lap, web, and sliver of cotton.\r\n\r\nFinally, the sliver of cotton is carried upward, as shown in the\r\nillustration (Fig. 15), and passed through special apparatus and\r\ndeposited into the can, also shown. This latter is about 10 inches in\r\ndiameter and 36 inches in length, and the whole arrangement for\r\ndepositing the cotton suitably into the can is denominated the \"Coiler.\"\r\nIn the next illustration (Fig. 16) are shown three forms in which the\r\ncotton is found before and after working by the Carding Engine. That to\r\nthe left is the lap as it enters, the middle figure is part of the web\r\nas it comes from the doffer, and that to the right is part of a coil of\r\ncotton from the can.\r\n\r\nSuch is a brief description of the most important of the preparatory\r\nprocesses of cotton spinning. There are innumerable details involving\r\ntechnical knowledge which fall outside the province of this story.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Drawing Frames.=--It is a very common thing for a new beginner in the\r\nstudy of cotton spinning to ask--what is the use of the drawing frame?\r\nAs a matter of fact, the unpractised eye cannot see any difference\r\nbetween the sliver or soft rope of cotton as it reaches, the drawing\r\nframe and as it leaves the frame.\r\n\r\nThe experienced eye of the practical man can, however, detect a\r\nwonderful difference.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that the immediately preceding operation of\r\ncarding--amongst other things--reduces the heavy lap into a\r\ncomparatively thin light sliver; thus advancing with one great stride a\r\nlong way toward the production of the long fine thread of yarn ready for\r\nthe market.\r\n\r\nNo such difference can be perceived in the sliver at the drawing frame.\r\nThis machine is practically devoted to improving the thread finally\r\nmade in two distinct and important ways.\r\n\r\n1. The fibres of cotton in the sliver, as they leave the Carding Engine,\r\nare in a very crossed and entangled condition, not at all suited to the\r\nproduction of a strong yarn by the usual processes of cotton spinning.\r\nThe first duty of the drawing frame may be said, therefore, to be the\r\nlaying of the fibres in parallel order to one another, by the action of\r\nthe drawing rollers.\r\n\r\n2. The sliver of cotton, as it leaves the card, is by no means\r\nsufficiently uniform in weight per yard for the production of a uniform\r\nand strong finished thread. It will easily be conceived by the readers\r\nof this story of the cotton plant that the strength of any thread is\r\nonly that of its weakest portions.\r\n\r\nTake a rope intended to hold a heavy weight suspended at its lower end,\r\nand assume it to be made of the best material and stoutest substance,\r\nbut to contain one very weak place in it; this rope would practically be\r\nuseless, because the strength of the rope would only be that of the\r\nweakest part.\r\n\r\nThe drawing machine in cotton spinning aims at removing the weak places\r\nin cotton thread, thus making the real strength of the thread vastly\r\ngreater than it would otherwise be.\r\n\r\nThe method by which these important objects are attained may be briefly\r\nexplained as follows:--\r\n\r\nFrom four to eight, but most usually six, cans of sliver from the\r\nprevious machine are placed behind the frame, and the ends of the\r\nslivers conducted over special mechanism within the range of action of\r\nfour pairs of drawing rollers. This passage of the cotton is shown very\r\nclearly in Fig. 17.\r\n\r\nThe top rollers are made of cast iron, covered with soft and highly\r\nfinished leather made from sheepskins, the object of this being to cause\r\nthe rollers to have a firm grip of the cotton fibres, without at the\r\nsame time injuring them. The bottom rollers are of iron or steel, made\r\nwith longitudinal flutes or grooves, in order to bite the cotton fibres\r\nfirmly on the leathers of the top rollers. In order to assist the\r\nrollers in maintaining a firm grip of the fibres the top rollers are\r\nheld down by somewhat heavy weights.\r\n\r\nThe action of the drawing rollers will be adequately discussed later in\r\nthis story, when dealing with the inventions of Lewis Paul and Sir\r\nRichard Arkwright, and need not be enlarged upon at this stage.\r\n\r\nIt will be sufficient, therefore, to say that, assuming that six slivers\r\nare put up together at the back of the frame, the \"draft\" or amount of\r\ndrawing-out between the first and second pairs of rollers the cotton\r\ncomes to, may be about 1.3, between the second and third pairs 1.8, and\r\nbetween the third and fourth pairs 2.6. These three multiplied together\r\ngive a total draft of slightly over 6.\r\n\r\nIn other words, assuming that 1 inch of cotton be passed through the\r\nfirst pair of rollers, the second pair will immediately draw it out into\r\n1.3 inches; the third pair will draw out the same portion of cotton into\r\n1.3 × 1.8 inches = 2.34 inches, and the fourth or last pair of rollers\r\nwill draw out the same portion of cotton into 2.34 × 2.6 inches = 6.084.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 17.--Drawing frame showing eight slivers entering and one\r\n                 leaving the machine.\r\n\r\nThe six slivers put up at the back are therefore drawn out or\r\nattenuated to the dimensions of one by the rollers, and then at the\r\ndelivery side of the machine the six slivers are united into one sliver,\r\nand arranged in beautiful order inside a can exactly as described for\r\nthe Carding Engine.\r\n\r\nNow it is in the doubling together and again drawing-out of the slivers\r\nof cotton that the two objects of making the fibres parallel and the\r\nslivers uniform are effected.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, even the uninitiated readers of this story may\r\nconceive that the combining of six slivers will naturally cause any\r\nextra thick or thin places in any of the individual slivers to become\r\nmuch reduced in extent by falling along with correct diameters of the\r\nother five slivers; and experience proves that such is the actual fact.\r\nIn this way the slivers, or soft untwisted ropes of cotton, are made\r\nuniform.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps not so easy to see how it is that drawing rollers make the\r\nfibres of cotton parallel. As a matter of fact, it may be said that as\r\neach pair of rollers projects the fibres forward, the next pair of\r\nrollers takes hold of the fibres and draws their front extremities\r\nforward more rapidly than the other pair will let the back extremities\r\nof the same fibres pass forward. It is this action often repeated that\r\ndraws the fibres straight, or in other words, reduces them to a\r\ncondition in which they are parallel to each other.\r\n\r\nIt is the usual practice to pass each portion of cotton through three\r\nseparate frames in this manner, in immediate and rapid succession. The\r\n\"slivers\" or ropes of cotton made at the front of the first drawing\r\nframe, would be placed in their cans behind a second drawing frame and\r\nthe exact process just described would be repeated. The same identical\r\nprocess would usually be performed yet a third time in order to secure\r\nthe required objects with what is considered a sufficient degree of\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\nAfter this the cotton is usually deemed to be quite ready for the\r\nimmediately succeeding process of \"slubbing.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bobbin and Fly Frames.=--The series of machines now to be dealt with, are\r\ndistinguished more for their complicated mechanism in putting twist into\r\nthe attenuated cotton and in winding it upon bobbins in suitable form\r\nfor the immediately succeeding process, than for the action of the parts\r\nupon the cotton so as to render it better fitted for the production of\r\nstrong, fine yarn.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which these machines perform a part in the actual\r\nproduction of a thread or yarn is practically a repetition of the work\r\nof the drawing frame, with the great difference that the strand or thin\r\nrope of cotton leaves each machine of the series in a thinner and longer\r\ncondition than when it arrived.\r\n\r\nThis attenuation of the cotton roving is indeed the chief desideratum\r\nthat bobbin and fly frames aim at, although they assist in making the\r\nstrand of cotton more uniform by carrying still further to a limited\r\nextent the doubling principle so extensively utilised at the drawing\r\nframes.\r\n\r\nThe basis of the operations are again the drawing rollers, brought to\r\nsuch a state of perfection by Richard Arkwright, and here it may be\r\nuseful to remind the readers of this story how superior in this respect\r\nof general adaption Arkwright's method of spinning was to that of\r\nHargreaves'. It will be remembered that the latter named inventor\r\nutilised a travelling carriage, for drawing the cotton finer, while the\r\nformer performed the same work by drawing rollers.\r\n\r\nAlthough the travelling carriage principle was at one time somewhat\r\nlargely utilised in preparing the rovings for the final process of\r\nspinning, it has long since entirely given way before the superior\r\nmerits and adaptability of the drawing roller principle; and it is now\r\nthis latter method which is universally employed.\r\n\r\nIt usually takes three bobbin and fly frames to make up what may be\r\ncalled a \"set,\" each portion of the cotton roving passing through the\r\nthree machines in succession. For low classes of yarn only two of these\r\nmachines may be used, while for the finest yarns there are sometimes\r\nfour used to make up the \"set.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, all the readers of this story must understand that in an\r\nordinary-sized cotton spinning mill there will be many sets of these\r\nmachines, just as there will be a large number of \"carding engines\" and\r\n\"drawing frames,\" and mules. Bale brakers, openers and scutchers are so\r\nvery productive that only a limited number is required as compared with\r\nthe other machines already named.\r\n\r\nThose of our readers who have studied the details of Arkwright's\r\nspinning frame, described in another chapter in this book, and have\r\nunderstood those details, will have a clear comprehension of the action\r\nof the parts and leading mechanical principles concerned in the\r\noperations of a modern bobbin and fly frame. Certainly there are some of\r\nthe most difficult problems of cotton spinning involved in the mechanism\r\nof these machines, but these points are so highly technical that it is\r\nnot intended to introduce them here.\r\n\r\nThe \"set\" of machines just named are usually known by the names\r\n\"Slubber,\" \"Intermediate or Second Slubber,\" and \"Roving\" Frames.\r\n\r\nNearly all the operations and mechanisms involved in one are almost\r\nidentical in the others, so that a description of one only in the set is\r\nnecessary, merely explaining that the parts of each machine the cotton\r\ncomes to in the latter two of the set are smaller and more finely set\r\nthan the corresponding parts of the immediately preceding machine.\r\n\r\nTaking the Intermediate frame as a basis, the operation may be described\r\nas follows:--The bobbins formed at the slubbing frame are put in the\r\ncreel of the Intermediate, as shown in the photograph (Fig. 18), each\r\nbobbin resting on a wooden skewer or peg which will easily rotate.\r\n\r\nIn order to increase the uniformity of the roving or strand of cotton,\r\nthe ends from two of the slubbing rovings are conducted together through\r\nthe rollers of the machine.\r\n\r\nThere are three pairs of these rollers, acting on the cotton in every\r\nway just as described for the drawing frame.\r\n\r\nAlthough two rovings are put together behind the rollers, yet the\r\n\"draft\" or drawing-out power of the rollers is such, that the roving\r\nthat issues from the front of the rollers is about three times as thin\r\nas each individual roving put up behind the rollers. This drawing-out\r\naction of the rollers need not be further dilated upon at this stage.\r\n\r\nThe points which demand some little attention at our hands, are the\r\nmethods and mechanism involved in twisting the attenuated roving, and\r\nwinding it upon bobbins or spools in suitable form for the next process.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 18.--Intermediate frame (bobbin and fly frame).\r\n\r\nAs regards twisting of the roving it must be distinctly understood that\r\nwhen the attenuated strand of cotton issues from the rollers of the\r\nfirst bobbin and fly frame, it has become so thin and weak that it can\r\nno longer withstand the requisite handling without being seriously\r\ndamaged. Hence the introduction of \"Twist,\" which is by far the most\r\nimportant strength-producing factor or principle entering into the\r\ncomposition of cotton roving and yarn.\r\n\r\nWithout twist there would be no cotton factories, no cotton goods; none\r\nof the splendid and gigantic buildings of one description or another\r\nwhich are found so plentifully intermingled with the dwellings and\r\nfactories of large cotton manufacturing towns!\r\n\r\nIn a sense it is to this all-powerful factor of \"twist\" that all these\r\nbuildings owe their existence, since it would be practically impossible\r\nto make a thread from cotton fibres without the assistance of \"twist\" to\r\nmake the fibres adhere to each other. Hence there could be none of that\r\nwealth which has caused the erection of these buildings.\r\n\r\nThis is true in a double sense, since we have both the natural twist of\r\nthe cotton fibres and the artificial twist introduced at the latter\r\nprocesses of cotton spinning, in order to make individual fibres and\r\naggregations of fibres adhere to each other. What is termed the natural\r\ntwist of the fibres may average in good cottons upwards of 180 twists\r\nper inch, while the twists per inch put into the finished threads of\r\nyarn from those fibres may vary, say, between 20 and 30 twists per\r\ninch.\r\n\r\nIn all the fly frames, therefore, this artificial twist is invariably\r\nand necessarily put into the roving. As the cotton leaves the front or\r\ndelivery rollers, each strand descends to a bobbin of from 8 to 12\r\ninches long, upon which it is wound by special mechanism. As in\r\nArkwright's frame, this bobbin is placed loosely upon a vertical\r\n\"spindle,\" and upon the latter is fitted a \"flyer,\" whose duty it is to\r\nguide the cotton upon the bobbin.\r\n\r\nThe primary duty of the spindle is to insert the \"twist\" which has been\r\nshown to be so necessary to give sufficient strength to the roving.\r\n\r\nLet any reader of this story hold a piece of soft stuff in one hand\r\nwhile with the other hand he rotates or twists the roving and he will\r\nhave an idea of the method and effect of twisting (see Fig. 19).\r\n\r\nWithout going into minute details we may say that the practical effect\r\nis that, while the roving is held firmly by the rollers, it is twisted\r\nby means of its connection at the other end to the rotating bobbin,\r\nspindle and flyer. The twist runs right from the spindle along the 6 to\r\n12 inches of cotton that may extend from the spindle top to the \"nip\" of\r\nthe rollers, thus imparting the requisite strength to the roving as it\r\nissues from the rollers. The mechanism for revolving the spindles is by\r\nno means difficult to understand, simply consisting of a number of\r\nshafts and wheels revolved at a constant, definite and regulated speed\r\nper minute.\r\n\r\nNot only is it necessary to provide special apparatus for twisting the\r\ncotton at the bobbin and fly frames, but also very complicated and\r\nhighly ingenious mechanism for winding the attenuated cotton in suitable\r\nform upon the bobbins. Indeed it is with this very mechanism that some\r\nof the most difficult problems of cotton spinning machinery are\r\nassociated.\r\n\r\nAlthough the cotton at this stage is strengthened by twist, yet it is\r\nextremely inadvisable and practically inadmissible to insert more than\r\nfrom 1 to about 4 twists per inch at any of these machines, so that at\r\nthe best the rovings are still very weak.\r\n\r\nIf too much twist were inserted at any stage, the drawing rollers of the\r\nimmediately succeeding machine could not carry on the attenuating\r\nprocess satisfactorily.\r\n\r\nThis winding problem was so difficult that it absolutely baffled the\r\ningenuity of Arkwright and his contemporaries and immediate successors,\r\nand it was not until about 1825 that the difficulties were solved by the\r\ninvention of the differential winding motion by Mr. Holdsworth, a\r\nwell-known Manchester spinner, whose successors are still eminent master\r\ncotton spinners.\r\n\r\nThis winding motion is still more extensively used than any other,\r\nalthough it may be said that quite recently several new motions have\r\nbeen more or less adopted, whose design is to displace Holdsworth's\r\nmotion by performing the same work in a rather more satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\nIn these pages no attempt whatever will be made to give a technical\r\nexplanation of the mechanism of the winding motion. It may be said that\r\nit was a special application of the Sun and Planet motion originally\r\nutilised by Watt in his Steam Engine, for obtaining a rotary motion of\r\nhis fly-wheel.\r\n\r\nSufficient be it to say that this \"Differential Motion,\" acting in\r\nconjunction with what are termed \"Cone drums,\" imparts a varying motion\r\nto the bobbins upon which the cotton is wound, in such a manner that the\r\nrate of winding is kept practically constant throughout the formation of\r\nthe bobbins of roving, although the diameters of the latter are\r\nconstantly increasing.\r\n\r\nThe spindles and bobbins always rotate in the same direction, but while\r\nthe revolutions per minute of the spindles are constant, so as to keep\r\nthe twist uniform, those of the bobbins are always varying, in order to\r\ncompensate for their increasing diameters or thicknesses of the bobbins.\r\nThe delivery of cotton from the rollers is also constant and the\r\nmechanism required to operate them is exceedingly simple.\r\n\r\nA vast number of details could easily be added respecting the operations\r\nperformed by the bobbin and fly frames, but further treatment is deemed\r\nunnecessary in this story.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nEARLY ATTEMPTS AT SPINNING, AND EARLY INVENTORS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere can be no better illustration of the truth of the old saying, that\r\n\"Necessity is the mother of invention,\" than to read the early history\r\nof the cotton manufacture, and the difficulties under which the pioneers\r\nof England's greatest industry laboured.\r\n\r\nThe middle years of the eighteenth century act as the watershed between\r\nthe old and the new in cotton manufacture, for up to 1760 the same type\r\nof machinery was found in England which had existed in India for\r\ncenturies. But a change was coming, and as a greater demand arose for\r\ncotton goods, it became absolutely necessary to discover some better way\r\nof manipulating cotton, in order to get off a greater production.\r\n\r\n\"When inventors fail in their projects, no one pities them; when they\r\nsucceed, persecution, envy, and jealousy are their reward.\" So says\r\nBaines, and it would appear, from reference to the history of the cotton\r\nindustry, to be only too true. Certain it is, that the early inventors\r\nof the machinery for improving cotton spinning did not reap the\r\nadvantages which their labours and inventions entitled them to. They\r\nploughed and sowed, but others reaped.\r\n\r\nAmong the most celebrated of the early inventors, the following stand\r\nout in great prominence--John Kay, Lewis Paul, John Wyatt, Richard\r\nArkwright, Thomas Highs, James Hargreaves, and Samuel Crompton.\r\n\r\nWhen and how spinning originated no one can say, though it can be traced\r\nback through many, many centuries. Several nations claim to have been\r\nthe first to discover the art, but when asked for proof the initial\r\nstages are greatly obscured by impenetrable clouds of mystery.\r\n\r\nFor example, the Egyptians credit the goddess Isis with the discovery,\r\nthe Greeks Minerva, the Chinese the Emperor Yao. It is related of\r\nHercules, that, when in love with Omphale, he debased himself by taking\r\nthe spindle and spinning a thread at her feet. This form of work was\r\nconsidered to belong only to women, and by spinning for her in this\r\nposition he was thought to have greatly humiliated himself.\r\n\r\nIf Hercules were back again, and could stand between two modern mules\r\nand see the men and boys engaged in spinning hundreds of threads _at\r\nonce_, no doubt he would wonder, just as we do to-day at his fabled\r\nfeats.\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to imagine that very early on in the world's history\r\nthe twisting together of strands of wool and cotton would force itself\r\nupon the attention of the ancients. If the reader will take a little\r\ncotton wool in the left hand and by means of the first finger and thumb\r\nof the right take a few cotton fibres and gently twist them together and\r\nat the same time draw the thread formed outwards, it will be seen how\r\nvery easy it is (from the nature of the cotton) to form a continuous\r\nthread.\r\n\r\nWhat would very soon suggest itself would be something to which the\r\nthread, when twisted, could be fastened and, according to Mr. Marsden\r\n(who supposes the first spinner to have been a shepherd boy), a twig\r\nwhich was close at hand would be the very thing to which he could attach\r\nhis twisted fibres. He also supposes that, having spun a short length,\r\nthe twig by accident was allowed to dangle and immediately to untwist by\r\nspinning round in the reverse way, and ultimately fall to the ground.\r\n\r\nHe further adds, the boy would argue to himself \"that if this revolving\r\ntwig could take the twist out by a reversion of its movements, it could\r\nbe made to put it in.\" This would be the first spinning spindle. The\r\nexplanation is probably not very far wide of the mark.\r\n\r\nA weighted twig or spindle would next be used, and as each length of\r\nspun thread was finished, it would be wound on to the spindle and\r\nfastened.\r\n\r\nAs it would be extremely awkward to work the fibre up without a proper\r\nsupply, a bundle of this was fastened to the end of a stick and carried\r\nmost probably under the left arm, leaving the right hand free, or in the\r\nbelt, much in the same way as is done in some country districts in the\r\nNorth of Europe to-day.\r\n\r\nThe modern name for this stick is _Distaff_, a word which is derived\r\nfrom the Low German--_diesse_, the bunch of flax on a distaff, and\r\n_staff_. Originally it would be the staff on which the tow or flax was\r\nfastened, and from which the thread was drawn. The modern representative\r\nof the spindle with the twisted thread wound on it is the \"_cop_,\" and\r\nthe intermittent actions of first putting _twist_ in the thread and then\r\n_winding_ on the spindle, have their exact counterparts on the latest of\r\nthe self-acting mules of to-day.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 19.--Twist put in cotton by the hand.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to note that St. Distaff's Day is January 7th,\r\nthe day after the Epiphany, a church festival celebrated in\r\ncommemoration of the visit of the Wise Men of the East to Bethlehem. As\r\nthis marks the end of the Christmas festival, work with the distaff was\r\ncommenced, hence the name, St. Distaff's Day.\r\n\r\nIt is also called \"Rock Day,\" rock being another name for distaff.\r\n\"Rocking Day\" in Scotland was a feasting day when friends and neighbours\r\nmet together in the early days of the New Year, to celebrate the end of\r\nthe Christmastide festival.\r\n\r\nThe reign of Henry VII. is said to have witnessed the introduction into\r\nEngland of the spindle and distaff.\r\n\r\nIn process of time, the suspended spindle was superseded by one which\r\nwas driven by mechanical means. Over and over again, the spindle, as it\r\nlay upon the floor, must have suggested that it could be made to work in\r\nthat position, viz., horizontal. And so comes now a contrivance for\r\nholding the spindle in this position.\r\n\r\nMr. Baines, in his history of the cotton manufacture, gives a figure of\r\nan old Hindoo spinning wheel, and it is extremely likely that this very\r\nform of machine was the forerunner of the type which later on found its\r\nway into Europe. At the beginning of the sixteenth century what was\r\nknown as the Jersey wheel came into common use. This machine is shown in\r\nFig. 20.\r\n\r\nLying to the left hand of the woman in the illustration is a hand card.\r\nThis consisted of square board with a handle, and was covered by fine\r\nwire driven in, so as to make what was really a wire brush. By means of\r\nthis, the spinner was enabled to prepare her cotton, and she did with\r\nit (though not nearly so well) what is done by the Carding Engine of\r\nto-day, viz., fully opened out the fibres of cotton ready for spinning.\r\nHaving taken the cotton from the hand cards, she produced at first a\r\nvery thick thread which was called a _roving_. This she wound on a\r\nspindle, which was afterwards treated again on the wheel a second time,\r\nand drawn out still more, and then having the twist put in, it was made\r\nmuch thinner into so-called yarn. Only one thread could by this method\r\nbe dealt with at a time by one person, but the main operations carried\r\nout on the old spinning wheel have their exact reproductions on the mule\r\nof to-day, viz.:--Drawing, Twisting and Winding.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 20.--Jersey spinning wheel (after Baines).\r\n\r\nBut still the process of evolution went on, and following quickly on\r\nthe heels of the Jersey wheel is the Saxony or Leipsic wheel. Here for\r\nthe first time is seen the combination of spindle, flyer and bobbin.\r\n\r\nThis machine was so arranged that by means of two grooved wheels of\r\ndifferent diameters, but both driven by the large wheel similar to the\r\none in the Jersey wheel, and which was operated by the spinner, two\r\nspeeds were obtained. The bobbin was attached to the smaller, and the\r\nspindle, to which was fastened the flyer or \"Twister,\" was driven by the\r\nlarger of two wheels.\r\n\r\nIn this form of spinning machine, then, there were the following\r\noperations performed:--\r\n\r\nBy the spindle and flyer both revolving at the same velocity, the thread\r\nwas attenuated and twisted as it was carried to the bobbin. This latter\r\nwas, as already named, driven by the smaller of the two wheels and had a\r\nmotion all its own, though much quicker than that of the spindle. In\r\nthis way a bobbin of yarn was built up, and the Saxony wheel no doubt\r\ngave many fruitful ideas to the inventors who appeared later on, and\r\nwho, by reason of their research and experiment, evolved the fly frames\r\nof to-day; this was notably so in the case of Arkwright.\r\n\r\nThere had been very great opposition to the introduction of cotton goods\r\ninto England by manufacturers and others interested in the wool and\r\nfustian trade, and matters even got so bad that the British Parliament\r\nwas foolish enough to actually pass an Act in 1720, prohibiting \"the use\r\nor wear in Great Britain, in any garment or apparel whatsoever, of any\r\nprinted, painted, stained, or dyed _calico_, under the penalty of\r\nforfeiting to the informer the sum of £5.\"\r\n\r\nJust as though this was not sufficiently severe, it was also enacted\r\nthat persons using printed or dyed calico \"in or about any bed, chair,\r\ncushion, window-curtain, or any other sort of household stuff or\r\nfurniture,\" would be fined £20, and a like amount was to be paid by\r\nthose who sold the stuff.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt whatever, that this Act was designed to strike a\r\ndeath-blow at the cotton industry, which at this time was beginning to\r\nmake itself felt in the commerce of the country. A curious exception\r\nshould be mentioned here. Calico, which was all blue, was exempted from\r\nthe provisions of this Act, as were also muslins, fustians and\r\nneck-ties. However, in 1736 this iniquitous piece of legislation was\r\nsomewhat relaxed, and Parliament was good enough to decree in the year\r\njust named that it would be lawful for anyone to wear \"any sort of stuff\r\nmade of linen yarn and cotton wool manufactured and printed or painted\r\nwith any colour or colours within the kingdom of Great Britain, provided\r\nthat the warp thereof be entirely linen yarn.\"\r\n\r\nNow as half a loaf is better than none, the cotton manufacturers\r\nreceived a direct impulse by the partial removal of the obnoxious\r\nrestriction, and very soon the supply was far ahead of the demand.\r\n\r\nManufacturers were crying out constantly for more weight and better\r\nstuff, but how by the mechanical means at the disposal of the spinners\r\nwere they to get it? Lancashire historians say that it was no uncommon\r\nthing for weavers to travel miles in search of weft, and then many of\r\nthem returned to their looms with only a quarter of the amount they\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nAnother cause which acted in the direction of increasing the demand for\r\nyarns and weft was the invention of the _flying shuttle_ by John Kay\r\nabout 1738. Previous to his time, the heavy shuttles containing the\r\nwefts were sent across the looms by two persons. Now, by his new shuttle\r\nhe dispensed with the services of one of these artisans, and by means of\r\nhis arrangement for quickly sending the shuttle along the lathe of the\r\nloom, much more cloth was produced. Poor Kay suffered much by the cruel\r\npersecution of his countrymen, who ignorantly supposed that in bringing\r\nhis new shuttle to such perfection, they would be deprived _permanently_\r\nof their occupations, with nothing but starvation looking them in the\r\nface. Of course, nothing could be wider of the truth than this, but Kay\r\nhad to flee his country, and died in poverty and obscurity in a foreign\r\nland. Still the shuttle continued to be used, for the makers of cloth\r\nhad learned that increased production meant more work, and possibly\r\ngreater profit, and though Kay disappeared, his works remained behind.\r\nThe demand for weft grew more and more. It has been said that it is the\r\noccasion which makes the man, and not man the occasion. It was so in\r\nthis case, for here was a cry for some mechanical means to be discovered\r\nfor satisfying the ever-increasing demand for cotton weft. Hitherto\r\nsingle threads only had been dealt with on the spinning machines, but\r\nthe same year witnessed the introduction of an invention which in a few\r\nyears completely revolutionized the spinning industry, and which\r\nenabled one worker to spin hundreds of threads at once.\r\n\r\nThe year 1738, which witnessed the birth of Kay's invention, also saw\r\nthat of Lewis Paul, an artisan of Birmingham. This was a new method of\r\nspinning by means of _Rollers_. It should be remembered that this was\r\nthirty years before Arkwright attempted to obtain letters patent for his\r\nsystem of spinning by rollers.\r\n\r\nMost of the readers of this little book will have seen what is known in\r\n_domestic parlance_ as a clothes-wringer. Here the wooden or rubber\r\nrollers, by means of weights or screws, are made to squeeze out most of\r\nthe moisture which remains after the garment has left the washing-tub.\r\nNow if two sets of such rollers could be put together, so that in\r\nsection the four centres would coincide with the four angular points of\r\na square, and the back pair could be made to have a greater surface\r\nvelocity than the front pair, this arrangement would give something like\r\nthe idea which Paul had in his mind at that time. Why make the back pair\r\nrevolve at a greater rate? For this reason, that as the cotton was\r\nsupplied to the front pair, and passed on to the second, remembering\r\nthat these are going at a greater rate, it follows that the cotton\r\n_would be drawn out_ in passing from the first to the second pair. Had\r\nthe rollers been both going at the same speeds, the cotton would pass\r\nout as it went in, unaffected. Now it was this idea which Paul\r\npractically set out in his machine. From some reason or other, Paul's\r\nright to this patent has been often called into question, and up to 1858\r\nit was popularly supposed to have been the sole invention of John Wyatt\r\nof Birmingham. In the year named, Mr. Cole, in a paper read before the\r\nBritish Association, proved that Paul was the real patentee, and\r\nestablished the validity of his claim without doubt.\r\n\r\nThe two distinguishing features of Paul's Spinning Machine were: (1) by\r\nmeans of the rollers and flyers he performed the operations of\r\ndrawing-out and twisting, which had hitherto been done by the fingers\r\nand thumbs of the spinners; and (2) he changed the position of the\r\nspindle itself from the horizontal to the vertical.\r\n\r\nA glance at the Transactions of the Society for the Encouragement of\r\nArts, Manufactures and Commerce, shows that this period (1760-1770) was\r\nmost prolific of inventions specially relating to the various sections\r\nof the cotton industry. There were \"improved spinning wheels,\" \"a\r\nhorizontal spinning wheel,\" and three other forms of \"spinning machines\"\r\nsubmitted to the above society between 1761 and 1767, in the hope of\r\nobtaining money grants in the shape of premiums, which had been offered\r\nto the best inventions for improving spinning machinery in general.\r\n\r\nThe above list does not however contain any reference to one improvement\r\nby James Hargreaves of Blackburn, Lancashire, to which in this story\r\nspecial mention must be made.\r\n\r\nIt appears that in 1764 or 1765 this individual had completed a machine\r\nfor spinning eleven threads _simultaneously_; and five years later he\r\nhad developed the machine to so perfect a state that he took out a\r\npatent for it, from which time it became known to the industrial world\r\nas a _Spinning Jenny_. His right to the patent has over and over again\r\nbeen challenged, and it has been alleged that Thomas Highs of Leigh,\r\nalso in Lancashire, was the real inventor. Baines, in his \"History of\r\nthe Cotton Manufacture,\" is inclined to the view that Hargreaves was the\r\nfirst to perfect the machine known as the \"Jenny\" (see Fig. 21).\r\n\r\nFrom whatever point of view Hargreaves' machine is looked at, it must be\r\nacknowledged to be a decided step forward in the direction of spinning\r\nmachinery improvement.\r\n\r\nThe jenny was so unlike Arkwright's frame or Paul's, and preceded that\r\nof the former by some years, that its claim to originality can not be\r\nquestioned. How the inventor came to produce his machine can not be\r\nstated, but it is reported that on one occasion he saw a single thread\r\nspinning wheel which had been accidentally knocked over, lying with the\r\nwheel and spindle free and both revolving.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will think for a minute it will be apparent that the\r\nhorizontal position of the spindle would be changed to a vertical one,\r\nand Hargreaves argued if one spindle could revolve in that way, why\r\nshould not eight or any number of spindles be made to work at the same\r\ntime. How far he successfully worked out that idea will be seen if\r\nreference be made to the illustration of the jenny which is shown in\r\nFig. 21.\r\n\r\nAfter what has been said under the head of Carding, Drawing, and Roving,\r\nit will easily be understood when it is said that, unlike Arkwright's\r\nMachine, Hargreaves' Jenny could only deal with the cotton when in the\r\nstate of _roving_, and it was the roving which this machine attenuated\r\nand twisted or spun into yarn.\r\n\r\nIf the reader will imagine he or she is standing in front of the jenny,\r\nthe following description will be made much clearer:--\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 21.--Hargreaves' spinning jenny (after Baines).\r\n\r\nThe rovings, which have previously been prepared, are each passed from\r\nthe bobbins seen on the lower creel, through a number of grooves on one\r\nof the bars which run across the frame, as seen in the illustration.\r\nThese rovings are next passed on to the spindles standing at the back of\r\nthe frame and secured to them. A second bar in front of the one over\r\nwhich the rovings pass, acts as a brake and prevents, when in its proper\r\nposition, any more roving being delivered, thus securing all between the\r\nspindles and the said bar. The wheel which is seen on the right of the\r\njenny communicates with a cylinder by means of a strap or rope, and this\r\ncylinder in turning gives circular motion to the spindles which are\r\nconnected with the cylinder by endless bands. On the spindle is the\r\nwharf, specially formed to allow the band to run without slipping.\r\n\r\nThe operations for a complete spinning of one delivery is described by\r\nBaines as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"A certain portion of roving being extended from the spindles to the\r\nwooden clasp, the clasp was closed, and was then drawn along the\r\nhorizontal frame to a considerable distance from the spindles, by which\r\nthe threads were lengthened out, and reduced to the proper tenuity; this\r\nwas done with the spinner's left hand, and his right hand at the same\r\ntime turned a wheel which caused the spindles to revolve rapidly, and\r\nthus the roving was spun into yarn. By returning the clasp to its first\r\nsituation, and letting down a presser wire, the yarn was wound on the\r\nspindle.\"\r\n\r\nHatred and jealousy were immediately born when Hargreaves' splendid\r\nimprovement became known, and, like poor Kay before him, he had to leave\r\nhis native soil and get to some more secluded spot. He ultimately\r\narrived in Nottingham, set at once to accommodate himself to his new\r\nenvironment, and soon entered into partnership with a Mr. James, and in\r\n1770 took out a patent for his Jenny. In conjunction with his new\r\npartner, a mill was built, said to be one of the first, if not the\r\nfirst, spinning mill so called in this country.\r\n\r\nThough it is stated by Arkwright that Hargreaves died in comparative\r\nobscurity and poverty, others say that this is not so; though he was not\r\nwealthy the evidence is sufficiently good to believe that he died in\r\nmoderate circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe register of St. Mary's Parish, Nottingham, contains the following\r\nentry:--\"1778, April 22, James Hargraves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nFURTHER DEVELOPMENTS--ARKWRIGHT AND CROMPTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhatever may be said in favour of other spinning machinery inventors, it\r\nis quite certain that when we put the whole of them together, two stand\r\nout in greater prominence than any of the rest, viz., Arkwright and\r\nCrompton.\r\n\r\nProbably the former did more than any other Englishman to establish what\r\nis known as the Modern Factory System. He was not what one might call a\r\nbrilliant man or great inventor, but he had the happy knack of\r\nappreciating and seizing upon what he knew was a good thing, and set\r\nabout instantly to get all out of it that he could, and there are those\r\nwho strongly affirm that he often got much more than he was entitled to.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, it can not be denied that he possessed eminent\r\nbusiness qualifications, and these, coupled with other of his qualities,\r\nhelped to make him exceedingly successful.\r\n\r\nHe first saw the light of day on December 23rd, 1732, in Preston,\r\nLancashire, twenty-one years before his great rival and contemporary,\r\nSamuel Crompton. His parents could not possibly afford to give him any\r\nschooling, he being the youngest of thirteen. Apprenticed to the trade\r\nof barber, he became in time a first-rate man in that business. In 1760,\r\nwhen twenty-eight years of age, he left Preston and settled down in\r\nBolton in Lancashire, setting up the business of barber and\r\nperuke-maker. The youthful Samuel Crompton would no doubt pay him many\r\nvisits when in Churchgate, and little did he dream that the head he so\r\noften would undoubtedly use his skill upon was the one which would\r\nevolve by and by a machine which would amaze the then commercial world;\r\nbut it was so. Another part of Arkwright's business, that of travelling\r\nup and down the country buying and selling human hair for wig-making,\r\nwould put him _au fait_ with almost every new invention and idea.\r\n\r\nRichard's business card proves that he believed in advertising himself\r\neven as a barber.\r\n\r\nJust about this time there was much excitement, especially in\r\nLancashire, about the marvellous invention of Hargreaves, the\r\nparticulars of which had now become known to the public. One of the\r\nfirst to appreciate the significance of this invention was Arkwright\r\nhimself, so that it may reasonably be supposed that he would in good\r\ntime know all there was to be known of the mechanism used by Hargreaves\r\nin his new method of spinning.\r\n\r\nLater on, Arkwright became acquainted with a man named Highs of Leigh,\r\nanother experimenter in spinning. The circle of his acquaintanceship\r\nalso included Kay, a clockmaker of Warrington, who had assisted Highs on\r\nseveral occasions in his investigations.\r\n\r\nAt this time Arkwright's all-absorbing hobby was mechanics, and first\r\none experiment and then another was made in rapid succession. Needless\r\nto say, his business of barbering suffered in the meanwhile.\r\n\r\nFrom the first he turned his attention to an improvement of spinning\r\ncotton by drawing rollers. His efforts were crowned with success, and he\r\nultimately blossomed into a knight, and was elected High Sheriff of\r\nDerbyshire. It is rather singular that he should be about the only one\r\nof the cotton-machinery inventors of this age who amassed a fortune;\r\nmost of the others being but slightly removed from want in their last\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nThere were many who claimed that they were the real and original\r\ninventors of this method of spinning by rollers, but there can be no\r\ndoubt that to Arkwright alone belongs the credit for bringing these\r\nimprovements to a higher state of perfection than they ever attained\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, roller drawing is the great basis of the operations\r\nof modern spinning, wherever performed.\r\n\r\nNot only is this the case in the final stages of production, but it is\r\nespecially true of most of the preparatory processes, whether used for\r\nthe production of coarse, medium or fine yarns.\r\n\r\nAs is well known, the great principle of drawing rollers is, that the\r\ncotton is passed through three or four pairs of rollers in quick\r\nsuccession, and attenuated by each pair in turn, each pair being made to\r\nrevolve more quickly than the preceding pair. This identical process is\r\nrepeated in machine after machine, until finally the bulk of cotton is\r\nreduced to a fine thread, of which, in some cases, it takes two or three\r\nhundred miles to weigh _one pound_. Even in what are termed medium\r\nnumbers or counts of cotton yarn, there are from fifteen to twenty-five\r\nmiles of thread in a pound avoirdupois, and more than _a thousand\r\nmillion pounds_ of such yarns are spun annually.\r\n\r\nThe year 1767 found Arkwright entirely absorbed in his ideas of roller\r\ndrawing, and he got the clockmaker Kay to journey with him to\r\nNottingham, possibly thinking that what had been meted out to other\r\ninventors in Lancashire should not be repeated in his case. He here\r\ncollected about him a number of friends, moneyed and otherwise, who\r\nhelped in his evolution of spinning machinery.\r\n\r\nA man named John Smalley of Preston found him the wherewithal to carry\r\non his experiments first at Preston and later on at Nottingham.\r\nCertainly what he put up at Nottingham gave such promise of practical\r\nutility, that two experienced business men were led to join him in\r\npartnership, and the three of them, Need, Strutt, and Arkwright, very\r\nsoon had mills built in Nottingham, Cromford and Matlock. The\r\nfirst-named mill was worked by horses, the two latter by water, hence\r\nthe common name of _water frame_, given to the machines of Arkwright.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen taken into partnership were able and qualified to give\r\ngood sound advice and help to Arkwright, and about the middle of the\r\nyear 1769 he took out a patent for his \"_water frame_.\"\r\n\r\nTo use his own words, in his specification he \"had, by great study and\r\nlong application, invented a new piece of machinery, never before found\r\nout, practised or used, for the making of weft or yarn from cotton,\r\nflax, and wool; which would be of great utility to a great many\r\nmanufacturers, as well as to His Majesty's subjects in general, by\r\nemploying a great many poor people in working the said machinery, and by\r\nmaking the said weft or yarn much superior in quality to any heretofore\r\nmanufactured or made.\"\r\n\r\nNo useful purpose could be served by reproducing Arkwright's description\r\nof the machine in question, but a picture of the actual machine is\r\nshown in Fig. 22.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 22.--Arkwright's machine (after Baines).\r\n\r\nThe most important feature of the invention, of course, was the drawing\r\nout or attenuating of the cotton by rollers revolving at different\r\nspeeds. But it was also essential that proper mechanism should be\r\nprovided by which twist would be put into the yarn to make it\r\nsufficiently strong; and furthermore, it was necessary to arrange for\r\nthe attenuated and twisted cotton to be automatically guided and coiled\r\nup or wound up into a convenient form. As we have seen, the drawing out\r\nof the cotton finer he accomplished by the Drawing Rollers originally\r\ninvented by Lewis Paul, while for the latter purpose he successfully\r\nadapted the principle already existing in the Saxony wheel, used in the\r\nlinen manufacture, with which he probably became acquainted during his\r\nresidence at Preston.\r\n\r\nIt should not be forgotten that Hargreaves had introduced into the\r\ncommercial world his Jenny, a few years anterior to Arkwright's water\r\nframe becoming so successful. These two machines were more or less in\r\nrivalry, but not perhaps to that extent which many would suppose. From\r\nthe very first it was found that the frame of Arkwright's was much more\r\nsuitable for warp or twist yarns, _i.e._, the longitudinal threads of a\r\ncloth, whereas Hargreaves' machine was more adapted for the production\r\nof weft yarns, _i.e._, the transverse threads of a cloth. Now it cannot\r\nbe too strongly remarked that, at the present time, after the lapse of a\r\ncentury, the same state of things practically obtain in the improved\r\nmachines of to-day; Hargreaves' machine being represented by the system\r\nof intermittent spinning upon the improved self-actor mule, while\r\nArkwright's water frame is represented by the system of continuous\r\nspinning upon the modern Ring Spinning frame. While weft yarn is now\r\nalmost entirely produced on the mule, warp yarns are in many cases now\r\nobtained from the Ring Frames, this latter system at the present time\r\nbeing greatly on the increase and daily becoming more popular.\r\n\r\nThe Carding Engine was greatly improved by Arkwright's many useful\r\nimprovements, especially that of the Doffer comb, being entirely his\r\nown. The effect of this comb is fully described in the chapter dealing\r\nwith manipulation of the cotton by the Carding Engine.\r\n\r\nPaul was probably the first, in 1748, to invent the Carding Machine. His\r\ninventions seemed to hang fire until introduced into Lancashire, when\r\nthey were adopted by a Mr. Peel, Arkwright and others. The chief\r\ndefects, perhaps, of this machine was the absence of proper means for\r\nputting the cotton on the revolving cylinder and having it stripped when\r\nsufficiently carded. Hence the great value of Arkwright's stripping\r\ncomb.\r\n\r\nSome old Carding Engines which were used at this time are still in\r\nexistence, though only used for museum purposes. As will have been\r\ngathered in a former chapter dealing with the manipulation of the cotton\r\nin the mill, between the Carding Engine and the final process of\r\nspinning there are other and important stages of preparation, and in\r\nthese it is seen how in one respect Arkwright's method of drawing out\r\ncotton by revolving rollers was immeasurably superior to the travelling\r\ncarriage of Hargreaves.\r\n\r\nThe strength of a rope is represented by its weakest parts, and the same\r\nmay be said of yarn. There can be no doubt that one of Arkwright's\r\ngreatest difficulties was to give an uniform yarn, and though he\r\nsuccessfully launched his new machines he felt there was still much to\r\nbe done in the direction of remedying yarn which was irregular in\r\nthickness and strength. In order to do this, he finally adapted his\r\ndrawing rollers to what is now the modern drawing frame--a machine quite\r\nas largely used, and quite as necessary in present-day spinning, as it\r\nwas a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nIt was sought to make this machine do two things. (1) Several slivers\r\nof cotton from the Card were put up together at the back, and by means\r\nof four pairs of drawing rollers, were reduced to the thickness of one\r\nsliver (see the description in chapter vi.). It will be sufficient to\r\nsay here that this method of doubling and drawing equalises the sliver\r\nof cotton by the combination of the thick places with the thin.\r\n\r\nDoubling is now the reason of the uniformity of the yarns that are\r\nproduced in such large quantities.\r\n\r\n(2) The Carding Engine did not by any means lay the fibres of cotton\r\nsufficiently parallel to each other, and this process of parallelisation\r\nwas fully accomplished by the front ends of the fibres being drawn\r\nforward more rapidly than their back ends by the drawing rollers\r\nrevolving at different velocities. Mr. Baines says it was common to\r\nperform this operation until the finished sliver contained portions from\r\n_several thousand_ carding slivers, but we think he would have been\r\nnearer the mark if he had said several hundred; although the higher\r\nnumber may be occasionally reached.\r\n\r\nYet again, in order to obtain a thread or yarn of sufficient fineness,\r\nit was found necessary to perform some of the attenuation of the\r\ncotton sliver as it left the drawing frame and before it reached the\r\nfinal spinning process. To this end, Arkwright adopted the Roving frame,\r\nin which the leading feature was again the celebrated drawing rollers.\r\nThis machine made a soft and moderately twisted strand or roving, and if\r\nmuch twist had been put in, it would have refused to draw out finer at\r\nthe spinning machine. Hence the means provided by Arkwright for the\r\ntwisting and winding-on of the attenuated cotton on his spinning frame\r\nwere utterly inadequate to cope with the soft loose roving, and as a\r\nmatter of fact Arkwright never did see this problem satisfactorily\r\nsolved.\r\n\r\nHe allowed, in his machine, the roving to fall into a rapidly revolving\r\ncan which stood upright; the revolution imparting twist to the cotton.\r\nWhen this can was filled, it was carried to a winding frame, by which\r\nthe roving was wound upon bobbins suitable for the spinning frame.\r\n\r\nThat Arkwright was unscrupulous in some of his dealings will soon be\r\ngathered if the various trials which he instituted to defend his\r\nso-called patents be carefully read, though it must be admitted that he\r\npossessed a most wonderful business capacity, and that he worked early\r\nand late, in pushing his ideas with the most tireless energy and\r\ndetermined perseverance. A glimpse of the nature of his early struggles\r\nis obtained when it is recorded that on one occasion his wife broke some\r\nof his first rude models, under the impression that he would starve his\r\nfamily by neglect of his legitimate business of barber. So incensed at\r\nher for this was he, that he ceased to live with her. Such were the\r\ndefects of his early education and such his determination to learn, that\r\nat fifty he did not think he was too old to begin English grammar,\r\nwriting and arithmetic.\r\n\r\nThat he succeeded in getting together a large fortune is now history. He\r\ndied at the age of sixty on the 3rd August, 1792, at Cromford in\r\nDerbyshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Samuel Crompton.=--Perhaps the greatest of the cotton-spinning machinery\r\ninventors was Samuel Crompton, who was born a few miles away from Bolton\r\nin a delightfully secluded and sylvan spot, \"Firwood Fold,\" on the 3rd\r\nDecember, 1753. No story of the Cotton plant would be complete without\r\nmention of this individual, for wherever fine spinning machinery is\r\npractised there is a monument to the ingenuity, the skill and brilliant\r\ngenius of Samuel Crompton. At a very early age he, along with his\r\nparents, removed into a much larger house still in existence and known\r\nas \"The Hall ith Wood.\" This ancient mansion stands on a piece of high\r\nrocky ground and is distant from Bolton about 1-1/2 miles. It was in\r\nthis house that he invented his celebrated machine which he called \"A\r\nMule.\" At the present time one looks in vain for the Wood, but in the\r\nearly days of Crompton's tenancy it was surrounded by a great number of\r\nvery fine trees, hence the name \"The Hall in the Wood\" or \"Hall ith\r\nWood.\"\r\n\r\nFor some reason the Hall is being allowed to fall into decay, and at the\r\npresent time is in great danger of collapsing. Several attempts have\r\nbeen made to buy the place and reclaim as much of it as possible and\r\nconvert it into a museum, but as yet nothing has been done. It was built\r\nat two different periods: one portion of it, that of the \"post and\r\nplaster work,\" being built probably in the 15th century, while the newer\r\nor later portion of stone was erected about 1648, for that date is\r\ninscribed on the porch.\r\n\r\nThe inside does not appear to have received much care or improvement.\r\nOriginally the windows were much larger than at present. Pitt's window\r\ntax, long since repealed, was the direct cause for the reducing of the\r\nwindows from their former proportions.\r\n\r\nThe illustration gives an excellent idea of its present-day appearance.\r\nThe building is always an object of extreme interest to visitors to the\r\nlocality, presenting even now a very picturesque appearance.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 23.--The Hall ith Wood, where the spinning mule was invented.\r\n\r\nVery soon after the removal of the family to the Hall ith Wood, Samuel's\r\nfather died. His mother, however, one of the best of women, filled the\r\nduties of head of the house with much success, and followed the\r\nlaborious occupation of farming, and in her leisure moments, did what\r\nmany housewives of her class did--carded, spun, and wove, in order to\r\nprovide her family and herself with a decent livelihood.\r\n\r\nShe managed to give what might be termed under the circumstances a most\r\nexcellent and practical education to her son Samuel; and it may be here\r\nremarked, that in many respects he was the exact opposite of his\r\npredecessor Arkwright. The latter was certainly a bustling, pushing man\r\nof business, while Crompton was a born inventor and recluse, and be it\r\nsaid also, as big a failure, as a business man, as could be well\r\nconceived. Of course Arkwright, as is well known, was the opposite of\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nThe early youth of Crompton was identified with the great progress in\r\nthe cotton industry of England, and, at fifteen or sixteen years of age,\r\nhe was to be found assisting his mother during the daytime, while in the\r\nevenings he attended night-classes in Bolton, where he made great\r\nprogress in mathematics. He was so good at the latter subject that he\r\nwas called \"a witch at figures.\"\r\n\r\nIt may be taken as perfectly natural that a man of the character,\r\ntraining and early associations of Crompton should turn to invention in\r\nconnection with the cotton industry, especially since the beginning of\r\nhis association with the trade there had always been a scarcity of weft\r\nfor the loom which he and his mother operated.\r\n\r\nThe continual efforts of English weavers of that period to produce fine\r\ncotton goods to compete with those at that time largely imported from\r\nIndia, led to a great demand for fine yarns, and these the comparatively\r\nclumsy fingers of English spinners could not produce in a manner at all\r\nequal to the delicate filaments produced by the Hindoos.\r\n\r\nKay's invention of the fly shuttle, and the introduction by his son of\r\nthe drop-box in the loom, had vastly increased the output of the loom,\r\nthus increasing the demand for weft and warp to feed it.\r\n\r\nThe inventions of Arkwright, Paul and others had certainly done much\r\ntoward supplying this demand, but in Crompton's youth and early manhood\r\nthe need of suitable weft was greater than ever. Mrs. Crompton was not\r\nlong in hearing about the Jenny of Hargreaves, and determined she would\r\nget one for her son to work upon. This she did, and Crompton very soon\r\nbecame familiar with it and produced upon it sufficient weft for their\r\nown use. This he continued to do for seven or eight years, although he\r\nconstantly had the truth forced upon him, that the yarn he was producing\r\nwas neither as suitable for warps as that from Arkwright's water frame,\r\nnor at all adapted for the fine muslins then very much in requisition\r\nfor ladies' dresses.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of these muslins and of cotton quiltings was commenced\r\nin Bolton, Lancashire, by Joseph Shaw, when Crompton was about ten years\r\nof age; and from that time up to the present, no town in the world\r\nenjoys the same reputation for this class of goods as does Bolton.\r\n\r\nWith so contemplative and reflective a mind as Crompton's, and the many\r\nyears of constant and, to a great extent, solitary occupation on\r\nHargreaves' Jenny, it is not to be wondered at that Crompton's ingenious\r\nbrain led him to devise some mechanism for improving the jenny on which\r\nhe worked.\r\n\r\nIn 1774, therefore, he began those experiments which, after five years\r\nlabour, resulted in the invention of the \"New Wheel,\" or \"Muslin Wheel,\"\r\nor \"Hall ith Wood Wheel,\" as it was variously designated. The term\r\n\"Mule\" was of later application, owing to its comprising the essential\r\nfeatures of both Arkwright's and Hargreaves' inventions. Because it was\r\na cross or combination of the two it received the name of Mule, by which\r\nit is known to-day.\r\n\r\nAt the very time Crompton perfected his machine sufficiently to give it\r\na practical test, the Blackburn spinners and weavers were going\r\nriotously about, smashing to pieces every jenny with more than twenty\r\nspindles, that could be found for miles around the locality, so that\r\nCrompton took elaborate pains to conceal the various parts of his new\r\nmachine in the ceiling of his work-room at the Hall ith Wood in order to\r\nprevent their destruction.\r\n\r\nCrompton's hopes and prospects were very bright at this time, as he had\r\na watch costing five guineas expressly made for him, and just after the\r\ncompletion of his invention, he married one Mary Pimlott, at Bolton\r\nParish Church, 16th February 1780. He was then but twenty-seven years of\r\nage, and his great invention, destined to revolutionise the cotton\r\ntrade, was already an accomplished fact although practically a secret to\r\nthe world at large.\r\n\r\nWhen married, he and his wife set themselves assiduously to produce the\r\nfinest strong yarn which his machine was so eminently adapted to spin.\r\nIt did not take long for the good news to travel that fine yarn suitable\r\nfor the production of muslins was being made at the Hall ith Wood.\r\nHundreds of manufacturers visited Samuel to purchase, but many more came\r\nout of curiosity, if by any means they could see this wonderful machine.\r\nOne individual is said to have hidden himself five days in the cockloft\r\nand, having bored a hole through the ceiling, feasted one eye at least\r\nby a sight of the marvellous mechanism which Crompton had invented.\r\n\r\nBallantyne records that as much as 14s. per pound was obtained for 40's\r\nyarn; 25s. for 60's, and for a small quantity of 80's, 42s. per lb.\r\n\r\nAt the time of writing the market prices for these are respectively,\r\n7-3/4d., 9-3/4d., and 1s. 3d. per lb.\r\n\r\nCrompton, however, was not permitted to enjoy his prosperity and\r\nmonopoly very long, and here again may be noted the difference between\r\nhim and Arkwright. While the latter extorted the full business profit\r\nfrom his inventions, the former suffered his ingenious machine to get\r\nout of his hands by promises not worth the paper on which they were\r\nwritten. His invention was not at all adequately protected by patent\r\nrights, and a number of manufacturers were allowed to use the Mule on\r\ntheir simple written promise to give him some remuneration. Long\r\nafterwards he wrote:\r\n\r\n\"At last I consented, in hope of a generous and liberal subscription.\r\nThe consequence was, that from many subscribers, who would not pay the\r\nsums they had set opposite their names, when I applied to them for it, I\r\ngot nothing but abusive language given to me to drive me from them,\r\nwhich was easily done, for I never till then could think it possible\r\nthat any man (in such situation and circumstances) could pretend one\r\nthing and act the direct opposite. I then found it was possible, having\r\nhad proof positive.\"\r\n\r\nAnother side of Crompton's character may be seen when it is stated he\r\nwas an enthusiastic musician, and earned 1s. 6d. a night by playing the\r\nviolin at the Bolton Theatre. Four or five years after the invention was\r\nknown, he removed to the township of Sharples, where he occupied a\r\nfarm-house called \"The Oldhams,\" being probably induced to take this\r\nstep in order to secure greater privacy.\r\n\r\nA few words may very profitably be expended at this point in describing\r\nthe main features of the machine shown in Fig. 24.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 24.--Crompton's spinning mule.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that Arkwright had already attained great success\r\nin the production of yarn by the extensive application of the principle\r\nof pulling out the cotton by drawing rollers. Hargreaves had also shown\r\nhow to produce a thread by attenuating the cotton by means of a\r\ntravelling carriage.\r\n\r\nCrompton, however, laid the foundation of the present system of mule\r\nspinning by combining the essential features of the two machines and\r\nblending them into one.\r\n\r\nHe applied the principle of roller drawing in order to first attenuate\r\nthe cotton, and he utilised the travelling carriage as a reserve power\r\nwith which to improve the quality of the thread and draw it out finer.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that his travelling carriage was identical with\r\nthat of Hargreaves. On the contrary, it was a vast improvement upon it.\r\nCrompton put the twisting spindles into the travelling carriage and the\r\nroving bobbins he transferred to a fixed creel, and these conditions are\r\ninvariably to be found in the self-actor spinning mule of to-day.\r\n\r\nIn Hargreaves' machine the rovings were placed on the travelling\r\ncarriage, and the twisting spindles in the fixed frame behind, a\r\nposition which has never been acceptable since that time for\r\ncotton-spinning mules. Here, however, a word may be said in favour of\r\nHargreaves' disposition of the parts mentioned. The Jenny did not\r\ncontain any heavy drawing rollers and roller beams, and it was probably\r\nbest in his machine to have his crude roving creel to traverse and the\r\ntwisting spindles to be in a fixed frame.\r\n\r\nThis disposition of the parts is even now to be found in most Twiner\r\nMules, that is, mules used to double two or more single threads together\r\nwithout any process of drawing being applied to the cotton.\r\n\r\nWhen Crompton applied the principle of drawing rollers, his ingenious\r\nmind saw that it would be best to let the rollers, roller beam, and\r\nroving creel be in a fixed framework on account of their combined weight\r\nand size, making it very difficult to move them about.\r\n\r\nCrompton's great idea seems to have been to produce a better thread by\r\nhis machine than could be given by other machines, and in this he\r\nadmirably succeeded.\r\n\r\nThe mule being set in motion, the rollers first attenuated and then\r\ndelivered the cotton to the spindle carriage. The latter, by the action\r\nof the hand and knee, was made to recede from the rollers just about as\r\nfast as the cotton was delivered to the spindles, or possibly at a\r\nrather quicker rate. Then, while the thread was still in a soft state,\r\nthe rollers could be stopped and the threads pulled still finer by the\r\ncontinued recession of the spindle carriage from the rollers.\r\nAfterwards, when that length of thread was fully made, it wound on the\r\nspindles, and the carriage at the same time returned to the roller beam.\r\n\r\nThus each portion of thread was first subjected to the action of drawing\r\nrollers, as in Arkwright's machine, and then drawn still finer by the\r\nwithdrawal of the travelling carriage, as in Hargreaves' Jenny.\r\n\r\nShortly after Crompton's invention was given to the public, it began to\r\nbe improved in various ways. Henry Stones, a mechanic of Horwich, near\r\nBolton, substituted metal drawing rollers for Crompton's crude wooden\r\nrollers, doubtless copying the idea from Arkwright's water frame.\r\n\r\nAll the mules employed at first were necessarily short; by that is meant\r\nthey contained but few spindles, often 40 or 50 spindles. The biggest\r\nmule in Bolton in 1786 was said to contain 100 spindles. The preparation\r\nof the rovings for the mule about this time occupied the attention of\r\nCrompton, and he invented a Carding Engine which, however, did not\r\nattain very much success. Indeed it is said that one day so incensed was\r\nCrompton at the way he had been treated on account of his mule, that he\r\ntook an axe and smashed his engine to pieces.\r\n\r\nIn 1791 Crompton established a small manufactory in King Street, off\r\nDeansgate, in Bolton.\r\n\r\nIn 1800 a subscription, promoted mainly by Manchester gentlemen,\r\nresulted in £500 being handed over to Crompton, one of the contributors\r\nfor thirty guineas being the son of Sir R. Arkwright. With this money he\r\nwas enabled to enlarge his business somewhat--one of his new mules\r\ncontaining upwards of 360 spindles and another 220 spindles. The mules\r\nwere worked for many years, in fact, up to the sixties, when they passed\r\ninto the hands of Messrs. Dobson & Barlow, the eminent cotton machinists\r\nof Bolton. One of the mules made by Crompton is shown in Fig. 24.\r\n\r\nIn the early part of 1812 an agitation for a government grant in\r\nrecognition of Crompton's work made great progress. Mr. Perceval, the\r\nthen Prime Minister, was proceeding to the House of Commons to move that\r\na grant of £20,000 be made to Crompton, when he was shot by an assassin\r\nnamed Bellingham. There is no doubt, had this disastrous affair never\r\nhappened and Perceval made his proposal, a grant much larger than was\r\nactually voted (£5000) would have been made.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt that this grant was altogether inadequate, seeing that\r\nlarger sums had been voted to other investigators and inventors about\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\nOwing to his lack of business ability, and to ill fortune combined, poor\r\nCrompton did not get out of this money what he might have done. Several\r\nventures turned out altogether very differently than he expected. He\r\nbecame poorer and poorer, and was only protected from absolute want by\r\nsubscriptions and assistance provided by his true friends in the trade,\r\nnotably Mr. Kennedy, a Manchester manufacturer.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 25.--Portrait of Samuel Crompton. (_By the kind\r\n                 permission of W. Agnew & Son, Manchester._)\r\n\r\nAt the age of 74 he died, 26th June, 1827. He was interred in Bolton\r\nParish Churchyard, where a plain granite tomb sets forth the\r\nfollowing:--\"Samuel Crompton of Hall ith Wood, Inventor of the Mule,\r\nborn 3rd December, 1753, died 26th June, 1827.\"\r\n\r\nA noble monument of him is to be found standing on Nelson Square,\r\nBolton, in front of the General Post Office.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE MODERN SPINNING MULE.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Self-Actor Mule.=--In the preceding chapter there has been detailed\r\nthe particulars of the invention of the \"Mule\" by Samuel Crompton. Since\r\nthat event the mule has been the object of over a century of constant\r\nand uninterrupted improvement and development, especially in the details\r\nof greater or less importance.\r\n\r\nThe Self-Actor Mule of to-day represents and embodies the inventions of\r\nhundreds of the most intelligent men ever connected with any industry in\r\nthe world's history. It is universally acknowledged to be one of the\r\nmost wonderful and useful machines ever used. The actual operations of\r\nmaking a thread are however practically as left by Samuel Crompton over\r\na hundred years ago. It is only in details of mechanism involved in\r\nmaking the various operations more perfectly automatic, and of greater\r\nsize and productiveness, that the long line of inventors since\r\nCrompton's first mule was made, has been engaged.\r\n\r\nTo-day, such is the great size and wonderfully perfect automatic action\r\nof these machines, that they are found 120 feet long, while in width,\r\nover all, they may be 9 or 10 feet. Such a mule of this length would\r\ncontain over 1300 spindles, each spinning and winding 64 inches of\r\nthread in about 15 seconds, and one man with two youths would be\r\nsufficient to give all the attention such a machine required.\r\n\r\nIndependently of a vast number of inventors of smaller importance, there\r\nare several names which stand out in greater prominence in the history\r\nof the developments of the mule. Among these names must certainly be\r\nplaced, ahead of any others that might be named, that of Richard Roberts\r\nof Manchester, who succeeded in 1830, after about five years'\r\napplication, in making the mule self-acting.\r\n\r\nA good number of ingenious individuals had contributed more or less to\r\nthis result between the dates of Crompton's and Roberts' inventions, and\r\ndoubtless the results of the labours of these would be of great service\r\nto Roberts in his great task.\r\n\r\nIndeed, several inventors had previously brought out what might be\r\ntermed self-action mules, but it remained for Roberts to endow it with\r\nthat constant and automatic motion which obtains to-day in practically\r\nthe same form as left by him.\r\n\r\nThe special portion of mechanism with which his name is more especially\r\nidentified, is what is denominated the \"Quadrant.\" This is practically\r\nthe fourth part of a large wheel, which is so arranged and connected\r\nthat it performs almost exactly the same functions on a mule that\r\nHoldsworth's differential motion performs on the bobbin and fly frames.\r\n\r\nTo look at it, one would imagine it to be--what it really is--one of the\r\nsimplest pieces of mechanism possible, yet the actions performed by it\r\nare complex and beautiful in the extreme. Later on, these actions of\r\nthe Quadrant will be carefully examined.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 26.--Mule head showing quadrant.\r\n\r\nThe self-actor mule is an intermittent spinning machine, _i.e._, it is\r\nnot continuous in action, as are most machines used in the making of\r\nthread or yarn from the fibrous product of the Cotton plant. Take for\r\ninstance the Carding Engine, and the bobbin and fly frames, as\r\npreviously described. So long as these machines are working, practically\r\nall of the acting parts of the mechanism have a continuous forward\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nThis is by no means the case with the machine now under consideration,\r\nas many of the more important and principal parts move alternately in\r\nopposite directions, while other of the less important may revolve at\r\none time, and be stationary at another.\r\n\r\nWhat are called the medium counts of yarn contain say from 30 to 50\r\nhanks in one pound avoirdupois; a cotton hank being equal to 840 yards,\r\nso that one pound of 40's yarn will contain no less than 40 × 840 yards\r\nor 33,600.\r\n\r\nFor such yarns as these, a modern self-actor mule would probably go\r\nthrough its cycle of movements four times per minute. For coarser or\r\nthicker yarns this speed might be increased, while for finer and better\r\nqualities of yarn the speed would be diminished.\r\n\r\nNow as each succeeding \"stretch\" marks a complete cycle of movements and\r\nis a repetition of others, it will probably suffice if a brief\r\nnon-technical description of one of these \"stretches\" or \"draws,\" as\r\nthey are termed in mill parlance, be given.\r\n\r\nAs in the bobbin and fly frames, the bobbins containing the rovings of\r\ncotton to be operated upon, are placed behind the mules on skewers\r\nfitted in a suitable framework of wood and iron called \"creels,\" so as\r\nto allow the cotton to be easily pulled off and unwound without\r\nbreaking. These rovings are guided to and drawn through three pairs of\r\ndrawing rollers (see Fig. 27), which shows this very fully.\r\n\r\nThe chief difference between these rollers and those of the previously\r\ndescribed machines being in the lessened diameters of the mule rollers,\r\nand consequently attenuating the cotton to a much greater extent. It\r\nis a truism well understood by those in the trade, that the finer the\r\nrovings are the better the raw cotton must be, and the more drawing-out\r\nthey will stand in any one machine. One inch of roving put up behind the\r\nrollers of a mule spinning medium numbers would probably be drawn out\r\ninto 9 inches.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 27.--Mules showing \"stretch\" of cotton yarn.\r\n\r\nNothing more need be said here about the action of the drawing rollers.\r\n\r\nAs the attenuated rovings leave the roller at the front, each one is\r\nconducted down to a spindle revolving at a high rate of speed; so\r\nquickly indeed, that there is no other body used in spinning which\r\napproaches it for speed.\r\n\r\nIt is quite a usual practice to have them making about 8000 revolutions\r\nper minute, and sometimes a speed of 10,000 is attained by them.\r\n\r\nAssuming that a \"Cop\" of yarn (see Fig. 27), showing the cops on the\r\nspindles, has been partly made upon each spindle, the roving or thread\r\nfrom the rollers would extend down to the cop and be coiled round the\r\nspindle upwards up to the apex. The spindle would probably twist the\r\nthread for 40's counts twenty-three or twenty-four times for each inch\r\nthat issued from the rollers, there being a well-recognised scale of\r\n\"twists per inch\" for various sorts and degrees of fineness of yarn.\r\n\r\nUnlike the bobbin and fly frames, the roving or yarn is not wound on its\r\ncop or spindle as it is delivered, but a certain definite and regulated\r\nlength of cotton is given out to each spindle, and fully twisted and\r\nattenuated before it is wound into a suitable shape for transit and for\r\nsubsequent treatment.\r\n\r\nTo keep each thread in tension, therefore, as it is delivered from the\r\nrollers, the carriage containing the twisting spindles is made to recede\r\nquickly away from the rollers, a common distance for such movement being\r\n64 inches. All the time the spindles are quickly revolving and putting\r\ntwist into the rovings, thus imparting strength to them to a far greater\r\ndegree than at any previous stage. Often the carriage is made to recede\r\nfrom the rollers a little quicker than the latter, the difference in the\r\nsurface speeds between the two being technically known as \"_gain_.\" The\r\nobject of this carriage \"gain\" is to improve the \"evenness\" of the yarn\r\nby drawing out any thick soft places there may be in the length of\r\nthread between each spindle and the roller, a distance of 64 inches. It\r\nis a property of the twist that it will run much more readily into the\r\nthinner portions of thread than the thicker, thus leaving the latter\r\ncapable of stretching out without breaking.\r\n\r\nArrived at the limit of 64 inches stretch (see Fig. 27), certain rods,\r\nlevers, wheels and springs are so actuated that the parts which draw out\r\nthe carriage and cause the rollers to revolve are disconnected, so that\r\nboth are brought to a standstill for the moment.\r\n\r\nIn many cases the spindles at this stage are kept on revolving in order\r\nto put in any twist that may be lacking in any portion of the stretch.\r\n\r\nTwisting being finished, the important operation of \"backing off\"\r\ncommences.\r\n\r\nIt maybe at once explained that \"backing off\" means the reversing of the\r\nspindles; the uncoiling of a portion of the yarn from the spindles; and\r\ngenerally putting all the requisite apparatus into position ready for\r\nwinding or coiling the attenuated and twisted rovings upon the spindles.\r\n\r\nHere come now into action those most beautiful and ingenious\r\napplications of mechanical principles, the working out of which entailed\r\nso many years of arduous effort, and which rendered the mule practically\r\nself-acting and automatic.\r\n\r\nBy a most wonderful, intricate and clever combination of levers, wheels,\r\npulleys and springs, aided by what is called a \"friction clutch,\" the\r\ninstant the spindles have ceased twisting the yarn, they are reversed in\r\ndirection of revolution.\r\n\r\nThis reversal only occupies two or three seconds, and as the motion\r\nimparted to the spindles is very slow at this stage, the practical\r\neffect is, that a small portion of yarn is \"_uncoiled_\" from each\r\nspindle, sufficient to allow of two \"guide wires\" to assume proper and\r\nnecessary positions for winding the attenuated threads upon the\r\nspindles.\r\n\r\nThese two wires are termed \"faller wires,\" and while one is controlled\r\nby the cop-shaping mechanism and termed the \"winding faller wire\" the\r\nother simply keeps the threads in the requisite state of tension during\r\n\"winding on\" and is termed the \"counter\" or \"tension faller wire.\" Both\r\nthese wires can be seen in Fig. 28. During backing off, the \"winding\r\nfaller wire\" has a descending motion, while the \"counter faller\" has an\r\nascending motion, these being necessary for them to attain their proper\r\npositions for \"winding on.\"\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 28.--Mule showing action of faller wires.\r\n\r\nThe movement of these faller wires into proper position, and the\r\nuncoiling of a small portion of yarn from each spindle, are both brought\r\nabout by the \"backing off\" motion, which formed an important part of\r\nRoberts' Mule. It may be remarked, however, that certain of the\r\npredecessors of Roberts had made great efforts in this direction, thus\r\nmaking the way much easier for his applications, which were entirely\r\nsuccessful. When \"backing off\" is completed, all the necessary parts are\r\nin position for winding the 64 inches of thread just given out upon each\r\nspindle.\r\n\r\nThis practically involves three primary and most important operations.\r\n(1) The drawing-in of the carriage back to its original position. (2)\r\nThe revolution of the spindles at a speed suitable for winding the\r\nthreads upon the spindles as the carriage moves inwards. (3) The guiding\r\nof the threads upon the spindles in such a manner that a cop of yarn\r\nwill eventually be formed upon each spindle, of such dimensions and\r\nshape as to be quite suitable for any subsequent processes or handling.\r\n\r\nTaking these three important divisions in the order given, it may be\r\nsaid that the drawing-in of the carriage is effected through the medium\r\nof the \"scroll\" bands, which are attached to the carriage at one end,\r\nand to certain spiral scrolls or fusees at the other end. The scrolls\r\nbeing revolved, wind the cords or bands round them, so pulling in the\r\ncarriage. There are usually two back scroll bands and one front band,\r\nthe latter being a sort of check band upon the action of the other two.\r\nWhat is termed the \"rim band\" revolves the spindles during the outward\r\ntraverse of the carriage.\r\n\r\nThe drawing-in of the carriage in a sense causes the other two\r\noperations to be performed. With respect to the second of these, viz.,\r\nrevolving the spindles and thus winding the threads upon them, it may be\r\nsaid this action causes what is termed the \"Winding Chain\" to pull off a\r\nsmall drum of six inches diameter, thus rotating the latter and thereby\r\nthe spindles. Here, however, comes in now the action of the very\r\nbeautiful and effective piece of mechanism, \"Roberts' quadrant\" (see\r\nFig. 26). The winding chain just mentioned is attached to one extremity\r\nto the arm of the quadrant, and the peculiar manner in which the\r\nquadrant moves in relation to the winding drum gives the variable motion\r\nto the spindles that is required.\r\n\r\nWhen commencing a new set of cops it may take about eighty revolutions\r\nof the spindles to wind on the 64 inches of thread to each spindle,\r\nrepresenting one stretch. The bare spindle may be about a quarter of an\r\ninch in diameter, but it may finally attain a diameter of an inch and a\r\nquarter (_i.e._, the cop upon the spindle). This cop will only require\r\nabout twenty revolutions to wind on the 64 inches, which are only\r\none-fourth of the revolutions necessary for the empty spindles. It is\r\nthe action of the quadrant which gives this variation in speed to the\r\nspindles during winding-on.\r\n\r\nBut as has been pointed out previously, the quadrant imparts a\r\n\"differential winding\" motion to the spindles in two distinct and\r\ndifferent ways, and the second motion is even more important than the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary for practical purposes that the cop of yarn should be\r\nbuilt up of a conical shape in the upper part, as shown in the\r\nillustration. Now it must be obvious to the least technical of the\r\nreaders of this story, that to wind a given portion of yarn upon the\r\nthin apex of a cone, will require a greater number of revolutions than\r\nwould be necessary to wind the same length of yarn upon the base of the\r\nsame cop. All the way between the apex and the base of the cone are also\r\nother varying diameters, and during each return movement of the mule\r\ncarriage the thread is wound upon all the varying diameters of the cone\r\nin succession.\r\n\r\nThis implies the necessity for the revolutions of the spindles to a\r\nvarying quantity all the time of the return or inward movement of the\r\nspindle carriage.\r\n\r\nThe quadrant gives this varying speed in a manner which is all but\r\nmathematically correct, any slight deviation from any such mathematical\r\ncorrectness being easily compensated for in other ways.\r\n\r\nFor the specific manner in which this quadrant works, the reader is\r\nreferred to any of the recent text-books on cotton spinning.\r\n\r\nThe third primary and important operation, which takes place during each\r\nreturn movement of the carriage, is the guiding of the thread upon the\r\nspindles in a correct manner. This operation is closely associated,\r\nhowever, with the action of the quadrant.\r\n\r\nThat portion of a \"self-actor mule\" which guides the faller wires is\r\ntermed the \"shaper\" or \"copping motion.\" It consists of an inclined iron\r\nrail upon the upper smooth surface of which slides the \"copping bowl,\"\r\nthis being a portion of the mechanism which connects the rail with the\r\nfaller wires. The rail rests upon suitable inclines termed \"copping\r\nplates,\" whose duty it is to regulate the movement of the rail so as to\r\nallow for the ever-increasing dimensions of the cop during the building\r\nprocess. When the carriage again reaches its initial position, suitable\r\nmechanism causes all the parts to return in the position required for\r\nspinning.\r\n\r\nSuch is the complete cycle of movements of the \"mule,\" each succeeding\r\ncycle being simply a repetition of the preceding. It will probably take\r\nsuch a mule as the one described about six hours to make a \"set of\r\ncops,\" _i.e._, one on each spindle, each cop being 1-1/4 inches in\r\ndiameter and 7-1/2 inches long. Every fifteen seconds, while the mule is\r\nmaking a cycle of its movements, may be divided up approximately as\r\nfollows: nine seconds for the drawing-out and twisting; two seconds for\r\nbacking-off; four seconds for winding-on and resuming initial position.\r\n\r\nA multitude of minor motions and details might be easily expanded into\r\nseveral chapters; in fact, more can be said about the mule than about\r\nany other spinning machine, but such detailed description would be out\r\nof place in this story.\r\n\r\nAll the motions just named are centred in what is termed the \"Head\r\nStock,\" this being placed midway in the length of the mule.\r\n\r\nThis head stock receives all the power to drive the various motions,\r\nfrom the shafting and gearing, and distributes it in a suitable manner\r\nto various parts of the machine.\r\n\r\nIt will have been observed by this time, that, as in the case of the\r\nbobbin and fly frames, the intricate and wonderful mechanism of the\r\nself-actor mule is not devoted to the formation of threads, but to the\r\neffective and economical placing of the threads of yarn, in the form of\r\ncops, after it has been spun.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 29.--Mule head showing \"copping rail.\"\r\n\r\nThe spinning processes take place during the outward traverse of the\r\nmule carriage, the mechanism involved in this motion being comparatively\r\nsimple. The really complicated and difficult motions being\r\n\"backing-off,\" revolving the spindles \"during winding-on,\" and the\r\nguiding of the spun threads upon the spindles during the winding-on\r\nprocess. It was the addition of these three motions by the later\r\ninventors which gave the mule the title of \"Self-Acting.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nOTHER PROCESSES IN COTTON SPINNING.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Ring Spinning Machine.=--In a former chapter it was shown how within\r\nthe space of two decades the three rival spinning machines of\r\nHargreaves, Arkwright and Crompton were introduced, also it was pointed\r\nout, that Crompton's machines contained the best points of both of his\r\npredecessors. The mule did not immediately become the sole spinning\r\nmachine. From the outset there was a close contest between the\r\ncontinuous spinning machine of Arkwright and the intermittent spinning\r\nmachine of Crompton. It was not long, however, before the mule asserted\r\nits superiority over the water frame for fine muslin yarns, and for weft\r\nyarns. Eventually the water frame was relegated to the production of\r\nstrong warp yarns, and later still it has come to be largely utilised\r\nas a doubling machine. As a matter of fact, it is contended by experts\r\nof the present day, that no machine ever made a rounder and more solid\r\nthread than the water frame, or flyer-throstle, as it has been called in\r\nits improved form.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 30.--Ring spinning frame.\r\n\r\nDuring the last thirty years, a revolution practically in cotton\r\nspinning has been gradually brought about, and even to-day active\r\ndevelopments are to be seen. The continuous system of spinning, which\r\nfor a time had to take a second place, now appears to be again forging\r\nahead, and looks as though it would supersede its more ponderous rival.\r\nEspecially in countries outside England is this the case, for it is\r\nfound that the method of ring spinning preponderates, and even in\r\nEngland the number of spindles devoted to continuous spinning is\r\nconstantly increasing.\r\n\r\nThis change has chiefly been brought about by what may be termed a\r\nrevolution in the winding and twisting mechanism of the continuous\r\nspinning machine itself.\r\n\r\nArkwright's flyer and spindle, after improvement by subsequent\r\ninventors, could not be revolved at anything like the speed of the\r\nspindle of the mule, and, in addition to this, the yarn had to be wound\r\nalways upon the bobbin, very much after the style of the bobbin and fly\r\nframes previously described.\r\n\r\nExperiments, however, were repeatedly made in the direction of\r\ndispensing with the flyer altogether, and some thirty years ago these\r\nunique spinning frames had attained very general adoption in the United\r\nStates of America, where the comparative dearth of skilled mule spinners\r\nhad furnished an impetus to improvement of the simple machine of\r\nArkwright.\r\n\r\nAbout this time, the attention of certain English makers being directed\r\nto the success of the new spinning frames in America, led to their\r\nintroduction into England. But little time elapsed before they received\r\na fair amount of adoption, but for many years they had a restricted use,\r\nviz., for doubling, that is, the twisting of two or more spun threads\r\ntogether, to form a stronger finished thread.\r\n\r\nIn this way, they were, strictly speaking, rivals of the throstle\r\ndoubling frame more than the spinning mule.\r\n\r\nBy and by, however, the time came when the new frames began to be\r\nadopted as spinning machines, and to-day there are many English and\r\nforeign mills containing nothing else in spinning machines on the\r\ncontinuous system except these. In not a few mills in different\r\ncountries, both types are found running.\r\n\r\nA careful glance at the picture of this rival of the mule, will help in\r\nthe following description of it:--\r\n\r\nThe flyer which is to be seen on the old Saxony wheel, and which was\r\nperpetuated in the celebrated machine of Arkwright, is entirely\r\ndispensed with, and all its functions efficiently performed by\r\napparatus, simple in itself; it is yet capable of high speed and heavy\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, there is a vastly improved and cleverly constructed form\r\nof spindle, by which, in the latest and best makes, any speed can be\r\nattained which is likely to be required for spinning purposes.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the apparatus which plays the most important part in performing\r\nthe duties of the displaced flyer, is a tiny \"traveller\" revolving\r\nround a specially made steel ring about 2 inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe use of these two latter gives the distinctive names of\r\n\"Ring-spinning\" to the new system and \"Ring Frame\" to the machine\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIn describing this system of spinning the creel of rovings to be\r\noperated upon, and the drawing rollers being practically identical with\r\nmachines already described, little here is required to be said of them,\r\nbut there is, however, a modification in the arrangement of the rollers\r\nwhich is referred to later on.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving the rollers, a thread of yarn is conducted downwards and\r\npassed through the \"travellers,\" which may be seen in the illustration,\r\nand then attached to the bobbin. The \"traveller\" is a tiny ring made of\r\nfinely tempered steel. It is sprung upon the edge of the ring shown in\r\nthe frame, and which is specially shaped to receive the tiny ring or\r\ntraveller referred to.\r\n\r\nThe bobbin in this case is practically fast to the spindle--unlike any\r\nother case in cotton-spinning machinery--and it is therefore carried\r\nround by the spindle at the same rate of speed.\r\n\r\nAs the spindle and bobbin revolve, they pull the traveller round by the\r\nyarn which passes through it, being connected at one end to the bobbin\r\nand the rollers above forming another point of attachment. If the reader\r\nwill look carefully at the illustration he will see how twist is put in\r\nthe yarn. The joint action, then, of bobbin, traveller and fixed ring,\r\nis to put the necessary twist in the yarn which gives it its proper\r\ndegree of strength. If no fresh roving from the rollers were issuing for\r\nthe moment, the small portion of thread reaching from the rollers to\r\nthe bobbins would simply be twisted without any \"winding-on\" taking\r\nplace. As a matter of fact, the roving always is issuing from the\r\nrollers, and \"winding-on\" of the twisted roving is performed by the\r\ntraveller lagging behind the bobbin in speed, to a degree equal to the\r\ndelivery of roving by the rollers. It will be remembered that in the old\r\nflyer-throstle \"winding-on\" was performed by the bobbin lagging behind\r\nthe spindle, a procedure which is impossible on the ring frame.\r\n\r\nThere is also an arrangement of the mechanism for guiding and shaping\r\nthe yarn upon the bobbins in suitable form, the action being as nearly\r\nas possible an imitation of the mule.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years after the introduction of these frames, it was\r\nfound that the threads often broke down owing to the twist not extending\r\nthrough the roving to the point where it issued from the rollers. This\r\nwas eventually remedied by placing the drawing rollers in a different\r\nposition, thus causing the thread running from the rollers to the\r\ntraveller to approach more to the vertical; this constituting the\r\nmodification which has just been referred to previously.\r\n\r\nAnother difficulty was experienced in the fact that during spinning the\r\nthreads would sometimes fly outwards to such an extent that adjacent\r\nthreads came in contact with each other, causing excessive breakage.\r\nThis was technically termed \"ballooning,\" and has been very\r\nsatisfactorily restricted by the invention of special apparatus.\r\n\r\nAt the present time, therefore, a contest between the two rival systems\r\nof continuous spinning which were in bitter antagonism over a century\r\nago, is waging a more fiercely contested fight than at any previous\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAs the case stands to-day, the mule is retained for nearly all the best\r\nand finest yarns as yet found; the most suitable for them, just as it\r\nwas when Crompton got 25s. per pound for spinning fine muslin yarns on\r\nhis first mule.\r\n\r\nIn many cases, also, yarn is specially required to be spun upon the bare\r\nspindle as on a mule, as for instance when used as weft and put into the\r\nshuttle of a loom. It is probably the very greatest defect of the ring\r\nframe that it can only, with great difficulty, be made to form a good\r\ncop of yarn on the bare spindle, although thousands of pounds have been\r\nspent on experimenting in that direction. How soon it may be\r\naccomplished with commercial success cannot be known, as a great number\r\nof individuals are constantly working in that direction. If it does come\r\nabout, there can be no doubt that the ring frame will receive a still\r\nfurther impetus.\r\n\r\nEven now, for medium counts of yarn it is much more productive than the\r\nmule, owing to its being a continuous spinner. Another vast advantage\r\nthat it possesses is the extreme simplicity of its parts and work as\r\ncompared with the mule. Because of this, women and girls are invariably\r\nemployed on the ring frames, whereas it requires skilled and well-paid\r\nworkmen for the mules.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Combing Machine.=--As compared with the Scutcher, the Carding Engine\r\nand Mule, the Comber is a much more modern machine. Combing may be\r\ndefined as being the most highly perfected application of the carding\r\nprinciple.\r\n\r\nThe chief objects aimed at by the comber are:--To extract all fibres\r\nbelow a certain length; to make the fibres parallel; and to extract any\r\nfine impurities that may have escaped the scutching and carding\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that although nearly all the great inventions\r\nrelating to cotton-spinning have been brought out by Englishmen, the\r\ncombing machine is a notable exception. It was invented a few years\r\nprior to 1851 by Joshua Heilman, who was born at Mulhouse, the principal\r\nseat of the Alsace cotton manufacture, in 1796.\r\n\r\nLike Samuel Crompton--the inventor of the mule--Joshua Heilman appears\r\nto have possessed the inventive faculty in a high degree, and he\r\nreceived an excellent training in mathematics, mechanical drawing,\r\npractical mechanics, and other subjects calculated to assist him in his\r\ncareer as an inventor.\r\n\r\nHeilman was the inventor of several useful improvements in connection\r\nwith spinning and weaving machinery, but the invention of the comber was\r\nundoubtedly his greatest achievement.\r\n\r\nHe was brought up in comparatively easy circumstances, and married a\r\nwife possessing a considerable amount of money; but all that both of\r\nthem possessed was swallowed up by Heilman's expenses in connection with\r\nhis inventions, and he himself was only raised from poverty again by the\r\nsuccess of the comber shortly before his death, his wife having died in\r\nthe midst of their poverty many years previously.\r\n\r\nAfter Heilman became possessed of the idea of inventing a combing\r\nmachine, he laboured incessantly at the project for several years,\r\nfirst in his native country and subsequently in England. The firm of\r\nSharpe & Roberts, formerly so famous in connection with the self-actor\r\nmule, made him a model, which, however, did not perform what Heilman\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nAfterwards he returned again to his native Alsace still possessed with\r\nthe idea, and finally it is said that the successful inspiration came to\r\nhim whilst watching his daughters comb out their long hair. The ultimate\r\nresult was that he invented a machine which was shown at the great\r\nexhibition of London in 1851 and immediately attracted the attention of\r\nthe textile manufacturers of Lancashire and Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nLarge sums of money were paid him by certain of the Lancashire cotton\r\nspinners for its exclusive use in the cotton trade. Certain of the\r\nwoollen masters of Yorkshire did the same, for its exclusive application\r\nto their trade, and it was also adopted for other textiles, although\r\nHeilman himself only lived a short time after his great success.\r\n\r\nIt must be understood that the comber is only used by a comparatively\r\nsmall proportion of the cotton spinners of the world. For all ordinary\r\npurposes a sufficiently good quality of yarn can be made without the\r\ncomber, and no other machine in cotton spinning adds half as much as the\r\ncomber to the expense of producing cotton yarn from the raw material.\r\n\r\nTo show this point with greater force, it may be mentioned that the\r\ncomber may make about 17 per cent. of waste, which is approximately as\r\nmuch as all the other machines in the mill put together would make.\r\n\r\nIts use, however, is indispensable in the production of the finest\r\nyarns, since no other machine can extract short fibre like the comber.\r\nIt is seldom used for counts of yarn below 60's and often as fine yarns\r\nas 100's or more are made without the comber. In England its use is\r\nchiefly centred in the localities of Bolton, Manchester, and Bollington,\r\nalthough there is a little combing in Preston, Ashton under Lyne, and\r\nother places.\r\n\r\nPerhaps its greatest value consists in the fact that its use enables\r\nfine yarns to be made out of cotton otherwise much too poor in quality\r\nfor the work; this being rendered possible chiefly by the special virtue\r\npossessed by the comber of extracting all fibres of cotton below a\r\ncertain length. This of course has led to the increased production and\r\nconsequently reduced price of the better qualities of yarn.\r\n\r\nReverting now to the Heilman Comber as it stands to-day, an excellent\r\nidea of the machine as a whole will be gathered from the photograph in\r\nFig. 31.\r\n\r\nThere are usually six small laps being operated upon simultaneously in\r\none comber. Each small lap being from 7-1/2 inches to 10-1/2 inches\r\nwide, being placed on fluted wooden rollers behind the machine, is\r\nslowly unwound by frictional contact therewith, and the sheet of cotton\r\nthus unwound is passed down a highly polished convex guide-plate to a\r\npair of small fluted steel rollers.\r\n\r\nBoth the wooden and the steel rollers have an intermittent motion, as\r\nindeed have also all the chief parts of the machine concerned in the\r\nactual combing of the cotton. The rollers, during each intermittent\r\nmovement, may project forward about 3/8 of an inch length of thin cotton\r\nlap.\r\n\r\nBy this forward movement the cotton fibres are passed between a pair\r\nof nippers which has been for the instant opened on purpose to allow of\r\nthis action. Immediately the cotton has passed between the nippers, the\r\nfeed rollers stop for an instant and the jaws of the nippers shut and\r\nhold the longer of the cotton fibres in a very firm manner.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 31.--Combing machine.\r\n\r\nThe shorter fibres, however, are not held so firmly, and are now combed\r\naway from the main body of the fibres by fine needles being passed\r\nthrough them. The needles are fixed in a revolving cylinder and are\r\ngraduated in fineness and in closeness of setting, so that while the\r\nfirst rows of needles may be about 20 to the inch, the last rows may\r\ncontain as many as 80 to the inch, there being from 15 to 17 rows of\r\nneedles in an ordinary comber.\r\n\r\nThe short fibres being combed out by the needles are stripped therefrom,\r\nand passed by suitable mechanism to the back of the machine to be\r\nafterwards used in the production of lower counts of yarn.\r\n\r\nThe needles of the revolving cylinder having passed through the fibres,\r\nthe nippers open again and at the same time another row of comb teeth or\r\nneedles, termed the top comb, descends into the fibres. The fibres now\r\nbeing liberated, certain detaching and attaching mechanism; as it is\r\ntermed, is brought into action, and the long fibres are taken forward,\r\nbeing pulled through the top comb during this operation. Thus the front\r\nends of the fibres are first combed and immediately afterwards the back\r\nends of the same fibres are combed. During the actual operation of\r\ncombing each small portion of cotton, the latter is quite separated from\r\nthe portion previously combed, and it is part of the work of the\r\ndetaching and attaching mechanism to lay the newly combed portion upon\r\nthat previously combed. From a mechanical point of view, the detaching\r\nand attaching mechanism is more difficult to understand than any other\r\nportion of the comber, and it is no part of the purpose of this \"story\r\nof the Cotton plant\" to enter into a description of this intricate\r\nmechanism.\r\n\r\nSufficient be it to say that the combed cotton leaves the detaching\r\nrollers in a thin silky-looking fleece which is at once gathered up into\r\na round sliver or strand and conducted down a long guide-plate towards\r\nthe end of the machine. This guide-plate is clearly shown in the\r\nphotograph of the comber, where also it will be seen that the slivers\r\nfrom the six laps which have been operated upon simultaneously are now\r\nlaid side by side.\r\n\r\nIn this form the cotton passes through the \"draw-box\" at the end of the\r\ncomber, and being here reduced practically to the dimensions of one\r\nsliver it passes through a narrow funnel and is placed in a can in\r\nconvenient form for the next process.\r\n\r\nWhen the combing is adopted, it precedes the drawing frame, which has\r\npreviously been described, and the cans of sliver from the comber are\r\ntaken directly to the draw-frame.\r\n\r\nFor intricacy and multiplicity of parts of mechanism, the comber is\r\nsecond only in cotton-spinning machinery to the self-acting mule, and is\r\nprobably less understood, since its use is confined to a section of the\r\ntrade. The latest development is the duplex comber, which makes the\r\nextraordinarily large number of one hundred and twenty nips per minute,\r\nas compared with about eighty-five nips per minute for the modern\r\nsingle nip comber. All this is the result of improvement in detail, as\r\nthe principle of Heilman's Comber remains the same as he left it. It\r\nought to be added that other types of comber have been adopted on the\r\ncontinent with some show of success.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 32.--Sliver lap machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sliver Lap Machine.=--Combing succeeds carding and is practically a\r\ncontinuation of the carding principle to a much finer degree than is\r\npossible on the card. The Carding Engine, however, makes slivers or\r\nstrands of cotton, while the comber requires the cotton to be presented\r\nto it in the form of thin sheets. It therefore becomes requisite to\r\nemploy apparatus for converting a number of the card slivers into a\r\nnarrow lap for the comber.\r\n\r\nThe machine universally employed is termed \"The Sliver Lap Machine,\" or,\r\nin some cases, \"The Derby Doubler,\" and a modern machine is shown in the\r\nphotograph forming Fig. 32.\r\n\r\nIn this case, eighteen cans are placed behind the machines, and the\r\nsliver from each can is conducted through an aperture in the back\r\nguide-plate designed to prevent entanglements of sliver from passing\r\nforward. Next each sliver passes over a spoon lever forming part of a\r\nmotion for automatically stopping the machine when an end breaks. The\r\neighteen slivers now pass side by side through three pairs of drawing\r\nrollers with a slight draft, and between calender rollers to a wooden\r\n\"core\" or roller. Upon this roller the slivers are wound in the form of\r\na lap, being assimilated to one another by the action of the drawing and\r\ncalender rollers.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Special Drawing Frame.=--In order to have the fibres of cotton in the\r\nbest possible condition for obtaining the maximum efficiency out of the\r\ncombing action, it is the common practice to employ a special drawing\r\nframe between the card and the sliver lap machine.\r\n\r\nAs described elsewhere in this little story, the use of the drawing\r\nframe is to make the fibres of cotton more parallel to each other by the\r\ndrawing action of the rollers, and to produce uniformity in the slivers\r\nof cotton by doubling about six of them together and reducing the six\r\ndown to the dimensions of one. In the case under discussion the slivers\r\nfrom the card are taken to the special drawing frame and treated by it,\r\nand then passed along to the sliver lap machine as just described.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 33.--Ribbon lap machine.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Ribbon Machine.=--Quite recently a machine has come slightly into use\r\ndesigned to supersede this special drawing frame. This new machine is\r\ntermed the \"Ribbon Lap Machine,\" and it may be described as a variation\r\nof the principle of the machine it is designed to supersede. The\r\ndifference is this, that, whereas the drawing frame doubles and\r\nattenuates slivers of cotton, the Ribbon Machine operates upon small\r\nlaps formed of ribbons or narrow sheets of cotton. By this treatment,\r\nthe evening and parallelising benefits of the drawing frame are secured,\r\nwith the addition of a third advantage, which may be briefly explained.\r\nThe slivers, which in the sliver lap machine are laid side by side so as\r\nto form a lap, have a tendency to show an individuality so as to present\r\na more or less thick and thin sheet to the action of the nippers of the\r\ncomber. The latter, therefore, hold the cotton somewhat feebly at the\r\nthin places, thus allowing the needles of the revolving cylinder to comb\r\nout a portion of good cotton. When the Ribbon Lap Machine is employed,\r\nthe slivers from the card are taken directly to the Sliver Lap Machine\r\nand the laps made by this machine are passed through the Ribbon Machine.\r\nSix laps being operated upon simultaneously by the rollers, are laid one\r\nupon another at the front so that thick and thin places amalgamate to\r\nproduce a sheet of uniform thickness. The use of the Ribbon Machine is\r\nlimited at present owing to its possessing certain disadvantages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nDESTINATION OF THE SPUN YARN.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving initiated our readers into all the processes incidental to the\r\nproduction of the long fine threads of yarn from the ponderous and\r\nweighty bales of cotton as received at the mill, it remains for us to\r\nbriefly indicate the more common uses to which the spun yarn is applied.\r\n\r\nA very large quantity of yarn is consumed in the weaving mills for the\r\nproduction of grey cloth without further treatment in the spinning mill,\r\nexcept that the cops of yarn are packed in ships, boxes, or casks, in\r\nconvenient form for transit purposes.\r\n\r\nIf for weft, the cops are forthwith taken to the loom, ready for the\r\nshuttle.\r\n\r\nIf for warp, then the yarn passes through a number of processes\r\nnecessary for its conversion, from the mule cop or ring bobbin form,\r\ninto the sheet form, consisting of many hundreds of threads, which are\r\nthen wound on a beam.\r\n\r\nBriefly enumerated, these processes are as follows:--\r\n\r\n(_a_) The winding frame, in which the threads from the cops or spools\r\nare wound upon flanged wooden bobbins, suitable for the creel of the\r\nnext machine.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The beam warping frame, in which perhaps 400 threads are pulled\r\nfrom the bobbins made at the winding frame, and wound side by side upon\r\na large wooden beam.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The \"slasher sizing frame,\" in which the threads from perhaps five\r\nof the beams made at the warping machine are unwound and laid upon one\r\nanother, so as to form a much denser warp of perhaps 2000 threads, and\r\nwrapped on a beam in a suitable form for fitting in the loom as the warp\r\nor \"woof\" of the woven fabric. In addition to this, the sizing machine\r\ncontains mechanism by which the threads are made to pass through a\r\nmixing of \"size\" or paste, which strengthens the threads.\r\n\r\nIn some cases this \"size\" is laid on the yarn very thickly, in order to\r\nmake the cloth weigh heavier.\r\n\r\n(_d_) After sizing comes the subsidiary process of \"drawing in\" or\r\n\"twisting in,\" by which all the threads are passed in a suitable manner\r\nthrough \"healds\" and \"reeds,\" so as to allow of their proper\r\nmanipulation by the mechanism of the loom, to which they are immediately\r\nafterwards transferred.\r\n\r\nIn the production of cloths of a more or less \"fancy\" description, it is\r\noften required that the spun yarns shall be bleached and dyed before\r\nusing, and to perform one or both of these operations efficiently, it is\r\nusual to reduce the yarn into proper condition by the processes of\r\n\"reeling\" and \"bundling,\" although in comparatively few instances yarn\r\nis dyed in the cop form, while in a few other cases the raw cotton is\r\ndyed before being subjected to the processes of cotton spinning.\r\n\r\n\"Reeling\" and \"Bundling\" are operations which are frequently necessary\r\nfor other purposes besides those above alluded to, and may therefore be\r\nmore fully described, as they often form part of the equipment of a\r\nspinning mill, and yarn is frequently sent away from the spinning mill\r\nin bundle form.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Reeling.=--This is a simple but very extensively adopted process, in\r\nwhich yarn is wound from cops, bobbins or spools into hanks. It may be\r\nexplained here that a cotton hank consists of 840 yards, and is made up\r\nof 7 leas of 120 yards each, while on a reel each lea is made up of 80\r\nthreads, a thread being 54 inches and equalling the circumference of the\r\nreel. Perhaps the most common size of reel contains at one time 40\r\nspindles, and is capable therefore of winding 40 hanks of yarn\r\nsimultaneously. The photograph in Fig. 34 shows a number of reels fitted\r\nfor winding hanks from cops formed upon the mule.\r\n\r\nThe cops being put on the skewers, the end of yarn from each is attached\r\nto the reel or \"swift\" ready for starting. These reels may be arranged\r\nso as to be operated from shafting by mechanical power, or by the hand\r\nof the attendants.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 34.--Reeling machine.\r\n\r\nReeling is performed by women, and in our photo the attendant is seen in\r\nthe actual operation of reeling.\r\n\r\nA hank of yarn having been taken from each cop, the reel is stopped and\r\nclosed up so as to allow of the ready withdrawal of the hanks.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bundling Machine.=--The Bundling press is solely intended to assist in\r\nthe making up of the hanks of yarn into a form suitable for ready and\r\nconvenient transit. In order to exercise a sufficient pressure upon the\r\nyarn to make a compact bundle, it is necessary for the framing to be of\r\na very strong character, as will be especially noticed in Fig. 35.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 35.--Bundling machine.\r\n\r\nThe bundles of yarn made up on the bundling machine are usually 5 to 10\r\npounds weight, the latter being by far the more common size. The bundle\r\nshown in the yarn-box of our illustration is 10 pounds in weight and is\r\npractically ready for removal.\r\n\r\nBefore placing the yarn in the machine, several hanks are twisted\r\ntogether to form a knot, and these \"knots\" comprise the individual\r\nmembers of the bundle shown in the illustration.\r\n\r\nIn the sides of the yarn-box there are four divisions, through which\r\nare threaded as many strings, upon which may be placed cardboard backs.\r\nThen the knots of yarn are neatly placed upon the strings, and the\r\ncardboard and the strong top bars of the press securely fastened down.\r\nCertain cams and levers are then set in motion, by which the yarn table\r\nis slowly and powerfully raised so as to press the yarn with great force\r\nagainst the top bars. A sufficient pressure having been exerted, the\r\nbundle is tied up and withdrawn from the press, only requiring to be\r\nneatly wrapped in stout paper to be quite ready for transit purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sewing Thread.=--A very large quantity of spun yarn is subsequently made\r\ninto sewing thread. It is a fact well known to practical men that we\r\nhave no means in cotton spinning by which a thread can be spun directly\r\nof sufficient strength to be used as sewing thread. For instance,\r\nsuppose we wanted a 12's sewing thread, _i.e._, a thread containing 12\r\nhanks in one pound of yarn; it would be practically impossible to spin a\r\nthread sufficiently good to meet the requirements of the case. The\r\nmethod generally adopted is to spin a much finer yarn and to make the\r\nfinished thread by doubling several of the fine spun yarns together in\r\norder to form the thicker final thread. For instance, to produce a 12's\r\nthread it is probable that 4 threads of single 48's would be doubled\r\ntogether, or say 4 threads of 50's, to allow for the slight contraction\r\nof the yarn brought about by twisting the single threads round one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nIn order to perform this doubling operation in an efficient manner for\r\nthe production of thread, it is usual to employ two machines.\r\n\r\nThe first of these is shown in the illustration, and is termed the quick\r\ntraverse winding machine. Here the cops from the mule, or the bobbins\r\nfrom the ring frame, are fitted in a suitable creel, as shown clearly at\r\nthe front and lower part of our illustration. Each thread of yarn is\r\nconducted over a flannel-covered board which cleans the yarn and keeps\r\nit tight. Then each thread passes through the eye of a small detector\r\nwire which is held up by the thread and forms part of an automatic stop\r\nmotion which stops the rotation of any particular bobbin or \"cheese\"\r\nwhen an end or thread belonging to that \"cheese\" fails or breaks,\r\nleaving the needles or detector wires. All the threads--from two to six\r\nin number--belonging to one \"cheese\" are combined to form one loose rope\r\nor thicker thread.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 36.--Quick traverse winding frame.\r\n\r\nIt ought to be explained that the term cheese is applied to the kind of\r\nbobbin of yarn which is formed upon this particular machine, one or two\r\nbeing placed as shown on the frame work.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Doubling Machine.=--The machine just described does not put any twist\r\ninto the thread, although twisting is a process which is absolutely\r\nindispensable for the proper combination of the several single threads\r\nso as to produce a strong doubled thread.\r\n\r\nThe twisting operation is therefore performed on the machine illustrated\r\nin Fig. 37, and termed the \"Ring doubling machine.\"\r\n\r\nIn the creel of this machine are placed the cheeses formed on the\r\nwinding machine, and the threads are conducted downward and usually\r\nunder a glass rod in trough containing water, as the addition of water\r\nhelps to solidify the single threads better into one doubled thread.\r\nFrom the water trough the threads are conducted between a pair of\r\nrevolving brass rollers which draw the threads from the cheeses and pass\r\nthem forward to the front of the machine. Here each doubled thread\r\nextends downwards and passes through a \"traveller\" upon the bobbin.\r\n\r\nThis machine is a modification of the ring spinning frame previously\r\ndescribed and therefore does not call for detailed treatment at our\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nThe two machines are practically identical in principle, the chief\r\ndifference being that in the doubler there are no drawing rollers, as\r\nthe cotton is not attenuated in any degree at this stage.\r\n\r\nOther differences consist in having larger \"travellers\" and \"rings\" and\r\n\"spindles,\" and in a different kind of bobbin being formed.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 37.--Ring doubling machine.\r\n\r\nAt the doubling mill these threads are submitted to finishing processes,\r\nby which they may be polished and cleared and finally wound upon small\r\nbobbins or spools ready for the market, as seen in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nA fair proportion of the very best yarns are utilised in the manufacture\r\nof lace and to imitate silk. Such yarns are usually passed through what\r\nis termed a \"gassing\" machine. In this process each thread is passed\r\nrapidly several times through a gas flame usually emanating from a\r\nburner of the Bunsen type. The passage of the thread through the flame\r\nis too rapid to allow of the burning down of the threads, but is not too\r\nquickly to prevent the loose oozy fibres, present more or less on the\r\nsurface of all cotton yarns, to be burned away. This process is somewhat\r\nexpensive, as it burns away perhaps 6 pounds weight of yarn in every 100\r\npounds. This, however, is obtained back again by the increased price of\r\nthe yarn. It is a property of the cotton fibre that it can be made to\r\nimitate more or less either woollen, linen or silk goods, and since\r\ncotton is the cheapest fibre of the lot it follows that a considerable\r\namount of cotton yarn is used in combination with these other fibres, in\r\norder to produce cheaper fabrics. Embroidery, crocheting and knitting\r\ncottons, and the hosiery trade absorb a large amount of the spun cotton\r\nyarn; the latter being doubled in most cases in order to fit it for the\r\nspecial work it is designed to do.\r\n\r\nIn a modern spinning mill the ground floor usually contains the openers,\r\nscutchers, drawing frames, carding engines and bobbin and fly-frames.\r\nThe upper floors are usually covered by mules and other spinning\r\nframes.\r\n\r\nImage: FIG. 38.--Engine house, showing driving to various storeys.\r\n\r\nIn the last illustration (Fig. 38) is shown one of the latest engines\r\nbuilt for special work such as is required in a cotton mill. The huge\r\ndrum, on which rest the ropes and which can be clearly seen in the\r\npicture, is divided into grooves. A certain number of these is set apart\r\nfor the special rooms. The strength of the rope is known and its\r\ntransmitting power is also known. When the power required to drive say\r\nthe first storey or second storey is calculated, it becomes an easy\r\nmatter to distribute the ropes on the drum as required. This engine is\r\nnow at work in the Bee-Hive Spinning Mill, Bolton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.\r\n\r\nAbbasi Cotton, 62.\r\n\r\n_Alethia argillacea_, 35.\r\n\r\n_Anthonomus grundis_,
