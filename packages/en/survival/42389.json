He has many times scribbled at the old bureau in\r\nChiefswood whereon Sir Walter worked at his novel, and sat in summer\r\nweather beneath the great tree on the lawn where Erskine used to read\r\nthe fresh chapters to Lockhart and his wife, while the burn murmured by\r\nfrom the Rhymer's Glen. So little altered is the cottage of Chiefswood\r\nby the addition of a gabled wing in the same red stone as the older\r\nportion, so charmed a quiet has the place, in the shelter of Eildon\r\nHill, that there one can readily beget the golden time again, and think\r\noneself back into the day when Mustard and Spice, running down the shady\r\nglen, might herald the coming of the Sheriff himself. Happy hours and\r\ngone: like that summer of 1821, whereof Lockhart speaks with an emotion\r\nthe more touching because it is so rare,--\r\n\r\n    the first of several seasons, which will ever dwell on my memory\r\n    as the happiest of my life. We were near enough Abbotsford to\r\n    partake as often as we liked of its brilliant society; yet could\r\n    do so without being exposed to the worry and exhaustion of spirit\r\n    which the daily reception of new visitors entailed upon all the\r\n    society except Sir Walter himself. But, in truth, even he was not\r\n    always proof against the annoyances connected with such a style of\r\n    open-house-keeping. Even his temper sank sometimes under the\r\n    solemn applause of learned dulness, the vapid raptures of painted\r\n    and periwigged dowagers the horse-leech avidity with which\r\n    underbred foreigners urged their questions, and the pompous\r\n    simpers of condescending magnates. When sore beset in this way, he\r\n    would every now and then discover that he had some very particular\r\n    business to attend to on an outlying part of his estate, and,\r\n    craving the indulgence of his guests overnight, appear at the\r\n    cabin in the glen before its inhabitants were astir in the\r\n    morning. The clatter of Sibyl Grey's hoofs, the yelping of Mustard\r\n    and Spice, and his own joyous shout of _reveillée_ under our\r\n    window, were the signal that he had burst his bonds, and meant for\r\n    that day to take his ease in his inn.... After breakfast he would\r\n    take possession of a dressing-room upstairs, and write a chapter\r\n    of \"The Pirate\"; and then, having made up and dispatched his\r\n    parcel for Mr. Ballantyne, away to join Purdie where the foresters\r\n    were at work....\r\n\r\n    The constant and eager delight with which Erskine watched the\r\n    progress of the tale has left a deep impression on my memory: and\r\n    indeed I heard so many of its chapters first read from the MS. by\r\n    him, that I can never open the book now without thinking I hear\r\n    his voice. Sir Walter used to give him at breakfast the pages he\r\n    had written that morning, and very commonly, while he was again at\r\n    work in his study, Erskine would walk over to Chiefswood, that he\r\n    might have the pleasure of reading them aloud to my wife and me\r\n    under our favourite tree.[1]\r\n\r\n\"The tree is living yet!\" This long quotation from a book but too little\r\nread in general may be excused for its interest, as bearing on the\r\ncomposition of \"The Pirate,\" in the early autumn of 1821. In \"The\r\nPirate\" Scott fell back on his recollections of the Orcades, as seen by\r\nhim in a tour with the Commissioners of Light Houses, in August 1814,\r\nimmediately after the publication of \"Waverley.\" They were accompanied\r\nby Mr. Stevenson, the celebrated engineer, \"a most gentlemanlike and\r\nmodest man, and well known by his scientific skill.\"[2] It is understood\r\nthat Mr. Stevenson also kept a diary, and that it is to be published by\r\nthe care of his distinguished grandson, Mr. Robert Louis Stevenson,\r\nauthor of \"Kidnapped,\" \"The Master of Ballantrae,\" and other novels in\r\nwhich Scott would have recognised a not alien genius.\r\n\r\nSir Walter's Diary, read in company with \"The Pirate,\" offers a most\r\ncurious study of his art in composition. It may be said that he scarcely\r\nnoted a natural feature, a monument, a custom, a superstition, or a\r\nlegend in Zetland and Orkney which he did not weave into the magic web\r\nof his romance. In the Diary all those matters appear as very ordinary;\r\nin \"The Pirate\" they are transfigured in the light of fancy. History\r\ngives Scott the career of Gow and his betrothal to an island lady:\r\nobservation gives him a few headlands, Picts' houses, ruined towers, and\r\nold stone monuments, and his characters gather about these, in rhythmic\r\narray, like the dancers in the sword-dance. We may conceive that\r\nCleveland, like Gow, was originally meant to die, and that Minna, like\r\nMargaret in the ballad of Clerk Saunders, was to recover her troth from\r\nthe hand of her dead lover. But, if Scott intended this, he was\r\ngood-natured, and relented.\r\n\r\nTaking the incidents in the Diary in company with the novel, we find, in\r\nthe very first page of \"The Pirate,\" mention of the roost, or rost, of\r\nSumburgh, the running current of tidal water, which he hated so, because\r\nit made him so sea-sick. \"All the landsmen sicker than sick, and our\r\nViceroy, Stevenson, qualmish. It is proposed to have a light on Sumburgh\r\nHead. Fitful Head is higher, but is to the west, from which quarter few\r\nvessels come.\" As for Sumburgh Head, Scott climbed it, rolled down a\r\nrock from the summit, and found it \"a fine situation to compose an ode\r\nto the Genius of Sumburgh Head, or an Elegy upon a Cormorant--or to have\r\nwritten or spoken madness of any kind in prose or poetry. But I gave\r\nvent to my excited feelings in a more simple way, and, sitting gently\r\ndown on the steep green slope which led to the beach, I e'en slid down a\r\nfew hundred feet, and found the exercise quite an adequate vent to my\r\nenthusiasm.\"\r\n\r\nSir Walter was certainly not what he found Mrs. Hemans, \"too poetical.\"\r\n\r\nIn the first chapter, his Giffords, Scotts (of Scotstarvet, the\r\nFifeshire house, not of the Border clan), and Mouats are the very gentry\r\nwho entertained him on his tour. His \"plantie cruives,\" in the novel,\r\nhad been noted in the Diary (Lockhart, iv. 193). \"Pate Stewart,\" the\r\noppressive Earl, is chronicled at length in \"the Diary.\" \"His huge tower\r\nremains wild and desolate--its chambers filled with sand, and its rifted\r\nwalls and dismantled battlements giving unrestrained access to the\r\nroaring sea-blast.\" So Scott wrote in his last review for the\r\n\"Quarterly,\" a criticism of Pitcairn's \"Scotch Criminal Trials\" (1831).\r\nThe Trows, or Drows, the fairy dwarfs he studied on the spot, and\r\nconnects the name with Dwerg, though _Trolls_ seem rather to be their\r\nspiritual and linguistic ancestors. The affair of the clergyman who was\r\ntaken for a Pecht, or Pict, actually occurred during the tour, and Mr.\r\nStevenson, who had met the poor Pecht before, was able to clear his\r\ncharacter.[3] In the same place the Kraken is mentioned: he had been\r\nvisible for nearly a fortnight, but no sailor dared go near him.\r\n\r\n  He lay in the offing a fortnight or more,\r\n  But the devil a Zetlander put from the shore.\r\n  If your Grace thinks I'm writing the thing that is not,\r\n  You may ask at a namesake of ours, Mr. Scott,\r\n\r\nSir Walter wrote to the Duke of Buccleugh. He paid a visit to an old\r\nlady, who, like Norna, and Æolus in the Odyssey, kept the winds in a\r\nbag, and could sell a fair breeze. \"She was a miserable figure, upwards\r\nof ninety, she told me, and dried up like a mummy. A sort of\r\nclay-coloured cloak, folded over her head, corresponded in colour to her\r\ncorpse-like complexion. Fine light-blue eyes, and nose and chin that\r\nalmost met, and a ghastly expression of cunning gave her quite the\r\neffect of Hecate. She told us she remembered _Gow the Pirate_, betrothed\r\nto a Miss Gordon,\"--so here are the germs of Norna, Cleveland, and\r\nMinna, all sown in good ground, to bear fruit in seven years\r\n(1814-1821). Triptolemus Yellowley is entirely derived from the Diary,\r\nand is an anachronism. The Lowland Scots factors and ploughs were only\r\ncoming in while Scott was in the isles. He himself saw the absurd little\r\nmills (vol. i. ch. xi.), and the one stilted plough which needed two\r\nwomen to open the furrows, a feebler plough than the Virgilian specimens\r\nwhich one still remarks in Tuscany. \"When this precious machine was in\r\nmotion, it was dragged by four little bullocks, yoked abreast, and as\r\nmany ponies harnessed, or rather strung, to the plough by ropes and\r\nthongs of raw hide.... An antiquary might be of opinion that this was\r\nthe very model of the original plough invented by Triptolemus,\" son of\r\nthe Eleusinian king, who sheltered Demeter in her wanderings. The\r\nsword-dance was not danced for Scott's entertainment, but he heard of\r\nthe Pupa dancers, and got a copy of the accompanying chant, and was\r\npresented with examples of the flint and bronze Celts which Norna\r\ntreasured. All over the world, as in Zetland, they were regarded as\r\n\"thunder stones.\" (Diary; Lockhart, iv. 220.) The bridal of Norna, by\r\nclasping of hands through Odin's stone ring, was still practised as a\r\nform of betrothal. (Lockhart, iv. 252.) Some island people were\r\ndespised, as by Magnus Troil, as \"poor sneaks\" who ate limpets, \"the\r\nlast of human meannesses.\" The \"wells,\" or smooth wave-currents, were\r\nalso noted, and the _Garland_ of the whalers often alluded to in the\r\ntale. The Stones of Stennis were visited, and the Dwarfie Stone of Hoy,\r\nwhere Norna, like some Eskimo Angekok, met her familiar demon. Scott\r\nheld that the stone \"probably was meant as the temple of some northern\r\nedition of the _dii Manes_. They conceive that the dwarf may be seen\r\nsometimes sitting at the door of his abode, but he vanishes on a nearer\r\napproach.\" The dwelling of Norna, a Pict's house, with an overhanging\r\nstory, \"shaped like a dice-box,\" is the ancient Castle of Mousa.[4] The\r\nstrange incantation of Norna, the dropping of molten lead into water, is\r\nalso described. Usually the lead was poured through the wards of a key.\r\nIn affections of the heart, like Minna's, a triangular stone, probably a\r\nneolithic arrow-head, was usually employed as an amulet. (Lockhart, iv.\r\n208.) Even the story of the pirate's insolent answer to the Provost is\r\nadapted from a recent occurrence. Two whalers were accused of stealing a\r\nsheep. The first denied the charge, but said he had seen the animal\r\ncarried off by \"a fellow with a red nose and a black wig. Don't you\r\nthink he was like his honour, Tom?\" \"By God, Jack, I believe it was the\r\nvery man.\" (Diary; Lockhart, iv. 222; \"The Pirate,\" vol. ii. ch. xiv.)\r\nThe goldless Northern Ophir was also visited--in brief, Scott scarcely\r\nmade a remark on his tour which he did not manage to transmute into the\r\nrare metal of his romance. It is no wonder that the Orcadians at once\r\ndetected his authorship. A trifling anecdote of the cruise has recently\r\nbeen published. Scott presented a lady in the isles with a piano, which,\r\nit seems, is still capable of producing a melancholy jingling tune.[5]\r\n\r\nLockhart says, as to the reception of \"The Pirate\" (Dec. 1821): \"The\r\nwild freshness of the atmosphere of this splendid romance, the beautiful\r\ncontrast of Minna and Brenda, and the exquisitely drawn character of\r\nCaptain Cleveland, found the reception which they deserved.\" \"The wild\r\nfreshness of the atmosphere\" is indeed magically transfused, and\r\nbreathes across the pages as it blows over the Fitful Head, the\r\nskerries, the desolate moors, the plain of the Standing Stones of\r\nStennis. The air is keen and salt and fragrant of the sea. Yet Sydney\r\nSmith was greatly disappointed. \"I am afraid this novel will depend upon\r\nthe former reputation of the author, and will add nothing to it. It may\r\nsell, and another may half sell, but that is all, unless he comes out\r\nwith something vigorous, and redeems himself. I do not blame him for\r\nwriting himself out, if he knows he is doing so, and has done his\r\n_best_, and his _all_. If the native land of Scotland will supply no\r\nmore scenes and characters, for he is always best in Scotland, though he\r\nwas very good in England the (time) he was there; but pray, wherever the\r\nscene is laid, no more Meg Merrilies and Dominie Sampsons--very good the\r\nfirst and second times, but now quite worn out, and always recurring.\"\r\n(\"Archibald Constable,\" iii. 69.)\r\n\r\nIt was Smith's grammar that gave out, and produced no apodosis to his\r\nphrase. Scott could not write himself out, before his brain was affected\r\nby disease. Had his age been miraculously prolonged, with health, it\r\ncould never be said that \"all the stories have been told,\" and he would\r\nhave delighted mankind unceasingly.\r\n\r\nScott himself was a little nettled by the criticisms of Norna as a\r\nreplica of Meg Merrilies. She is, indeed, \"something distinct from the\r\nDumfriesshire gipsy\"--in truth, she rather resembles the Ulrica of\r\n\"Ivanhoe.\" Like her, she is haunted by the memory of an awful crime, an\r\ninsane version of a mere accident; like her, she is a votaress of the\r\ndead gods of the older world, Thor and Odin, and the spirits of the\r\ntempest. Scott's imagination lived so much in the past that the ancient\r\ncreeds never ceased to allure him: like Heine, he felt the fascination\r\nof the banished deities, not of Greece, but of the North. Thus Norna,\r\ncrazed by her terrible mischance, dwells among them, worships the Red\r\nBeard, as outlying descendants of the Aztecs yet retain some faith in\r\ntheir old monstrous Pantheon. Even Minna keeps, in her girlish\r\nenthusiasm, some touch of Freydis in the saga of Eric the Red: for her\r\nthe old gods and the old years are not wholly exiled and impotent. All\r\nthis is most characteristic of the antiquary and the poet in Scott, who\r\nlingers fondly over what has been, and stirs the last faint embers of\r\nfallen fires. It is of a piece with the harmless Jacobitism of his\r\nfestivals, when they sang\r\n\r\n  Here's to the King, boys!\r\n  Ye ken wha I mean, boys.\r\n\r\nIn the singularly feeble and provincial vulgarities which Borrow\r\nlaunches, in the appendix to \"Lavengro,\" against the memory of Scott,\r\nthe charge of reviving Catholicism is the most bitter. That rowdy\r\nevangelist might as well have charged Scott with a desire to restore the\r\nworship of Odin, and to sacrifice human victims on the stone altar of\r\nStennis. He saw in Orkney the ruined fanes of the Norse deities, as at\r\nMelrose of the Virgin, and his loyal heart could feel for all that was\r\nold and lost, for all into which men had put their hearts and faiths,\r\nhad made, and had unmade, in the secular quest for the divine. Like a\r\nlater poet, he might have said:--\r\n\r\n  Not as their friend or child I speak,\r\n    But as on some far Northern strand,\r\n  Thinking of his own gods, a Greek\r\n    In pity and mournful awe might stand\r\n  Beside some fallen Runic stone,\r\n    For both were gods, and both are gone.\r\n\r\nAnd surely no creed is more savage, cruel, and worthy of death than\r\nBorrow's belief in a God who \"knew where to strike,\" and deliberately\r\nstruck Scott by inducing Robinson to speculate in hops, and so bring\r\ndown his Edinburgh associate, Constable, and with him Sir Walter! Such\r\nwas the religion which Borrow expressed in the style of a writer in a\r\nfourth-rate country newspaper. We might prefer the frank Heathenism of\r\nthe Red Beard to the religion of the author of \"The Bible in Spain.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no denying that Scott had in his imagination a certain mould of\r\nromance, into which his ideas, when he wrote most naturally, and most\r\nfor his own pleasure, were apt to run. It is one of the charms of \"The\r\nPirate\" that here he is manifestly writing for his own pleasure, with a\r\ncertain boyish eagerness. Had we but the plot of one of the tales which\r\nhe told, as a lad, to his friend Irving, we might find that it turned on\r\na romantic mystery, a clue in the hands of some witch or wise woman, of\r\nsome one who was always appearing in the nick of time, was always round\r\nthe corner when anything was to be heard. This is a standing\r\ncharacteristic of the tales: now it is Edie Ochiltree, now\r\nFlibbertigibbet, now Meg Merrilies, now Norna, who holds the thread of\r\nthe plot, but these characters are all well differentiated. Again, he\r\nhad types, especially the pedantic type, which attracted him, but they\r\nvary as much as Yellowley and Dugald Dalgetty, the Antiquary, and\r\nDominie Sampson. Yellowley is rather more repressed than some of Scott's\r\nbores; but then he is not the only bore, for Claud Halcro, with all his\r\nmerits, is a professed proser. Swift had exactly described the\r\ncharacter, the episodical narrator, in a passage parallel to one in\r\nTheophrastus. In writing to Morritt, Scott says (November 1818): \"I\r\nsympathise with you for the _dole_ you are _dreeing_ under the\r\ninflictions of your honest proser. Of all the boring machines ever\r\ndevised, your regular and determined story-teller is the most peremptory\r\nand powerful in his operations.\"\r\n\r\n\"With what perfect placidity he submitted to be bored even by bores of\r\nthe first water!\" says Lockhart. The species is one which we all have\r\nmany opportunities of studying, but it may be admitted that Scott\r\nproduced his studies of bores with a certain complacency. Yet they are\r\nall different bores, and the gay, kind _scald_ Halcro is very unlike\r\nMaster Mumblasen or Dominie Sampson.\r\n\r\nFor a hero Mordaunt may be called almost sprightly and individual. His\r\nmysterious father occasionally suggests the influence of Byron,\r\noccasionally of Mrs. Radcliffe. The Udaller is as individual and genial\r\nas Dandie Dinmont himself; or, again, he is the Cedric of Thule, though\r\nmuch more sympathetic than Cedric to most readers. His affection for his\r\ndaughters is characteristic and deserved. Many a pair of sisters, blonde\r\nand brune, have we met in fiction since Minna and Brenda, but none have\r\nbeen their peers, and, like Mordaunt in early years, we know not to\r\nwhich of them our hearts are given. They are \"L'Allegro\" and \"Il\r\nPenseroso\" of the North, and it is probable that all men would fall in\r\nlove with Minna if they had the chance, and marry Brenda, if they could.\r\nMinna is, indeed, the ideal youth of poetry, and Brenda of the practical\r\nlife. The innocent illusions of Minna, her love of all that is old, her\r\nchampionship of the forlorn cause, her beauty, her tenderness, her\r\ntruth, her passionate waywardness of sorrow, make her one of Scott's\r\nmost original and delightful heroines. She believes and trembles not,\r\nlike Bertram in \"Rokeby.\" Brenda trembles, but does not believe in\r\nNorna's magic, and in the spirits of ancient saga. As for Cleveland,\r\nScott managed to avoid Byron's Lara-like pirates, and produced a\r\nfreebooter as sympathetic as any _hostis humani generis_ can be, while\r\n\"Frederick Altamont\" (Thackeray borrowed the name for his romantic\r\ncrossing-sweeper) has a place among the Marischals and Bucklaws of\r\nromance. Scott's minute studies in Dryden come to the aid of his local\r\nobservations, and so, out of not very promising materials, and out of\r\nthe contrast of Lowland Scot and Orcadian, the romance is spun. Probably\r\nthe \"psychological analysis\" which most interested the author is the\r\ndouble consciousness of Norna, the occasional intrusions of the rational\r\nself on her dreams of supernatural powers. That double consciousness,\r\nindeed, exists in all of us: occasionally the self in which we believe\r\nhas a vision of the real underlying self, and shudders from the sight,\r\nlike the pair \"who met themselves\" in the celebrated drawing.\r\n\r\n\"The Pirate\" can scarcely be placed in the front rank of Scott's novels,\r\nbut it has a high and peculiar place in the second, and probably will\r\nalways be among the special favourites of those who, being young, are\r\nfortunate enough not to be critical.\r\n\r\nScott's novels at this time came forth so frequently that the lumbering\r\n\"Quarterlies\" toiled after them in vain. They adopted the plan of\r\nreviewing them in batches, and the \"Quarterly\" may be said to have\r\nomitted \"The Pirate\" altogether. About this time Gifford began to find\r\nthat the person who spoke of a \"dark dialect of Anglified Erse\" was not\r\na competent critic, and Mr. Senior noticed several of the tales in a\r\nmore judicious manner. As to \"The Pirate,\" the \"Edinburgh Review\"\r\nfound \"the character and story of Mertoun at once commonplace and\r\nextravagant.\" Cleveland disappoints \"by turning out so much better\r\nthan we had expected, and yet substantially so ill.\" \"Nothing can\r\nbe more beautiful than the description of the sisters.\" \"Norna is\r\na new incarnation of Meg Merrilies, and palpably the same in the\r\nspirit ... but far above the rank of a mere imitated or borrowed\r\ncharacter.\" \"The work, on the whole, opens up a new world to our\r\ncuriosity, and affords another proof of the extreme pliability,\r\nas well as vigour, of the author's genius.\"\r\n\r\n                                                          ANDREW LANG.\r\n  _August 1893._\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Lockhart, vi. 388-393. Erskine died before Scott, slain by a silly\r\npiece of gossip, and Mr. Skene says: \"I never saw Sir Walter so much\r\naffected by any event, and at the funeral, which he attended, he was\r\nquite unable to suppress his feelings, but wept like a child.\" His\r\ncorrespondence with Scott fell into the hands of a lady, who, seeing\r\nthat it revealed the secret of Scott's authorship, most unfortunately\r\nburned all the letters.

Among\r\nthe commissioners who manage this important public concern, the sheriff\r\nof each county of Scotland which borders on the sea, holds ex-officio a\r\nplace at the Board. These gentlemen act in every respect gratuitously,\r\nbut have the use of an armed yacht, well found and fitted up, when they\r\nchoose to visit the lighthouses. An excellent engineer, Mr. Robert\r\nStevenson, is attached to the Board, to afford the benefit of his\r\nprofessional advice. The author accompanied this expedition as a guest;\r\nfor Selkirkshire, though it calls him Sheriff, has not, like the kingdom\r\nof Bohemia in Corporal Trim's story, a seaport in its circuit, nor its\r\nmagistrate, of course, any place at the Board of Commissioners,--a\r\ncircumstance of little consequence where all were old and intimate\r\nfriends, bred to the same profession, and disposed to accommodate each\r\nother in every possible manner.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the important business which was the principal purpose of\r\nthe voyage, was connected with the amusement of visiting the leading\r\nobjects of a traveller's curiosity; for the wild cape, or formidable\r\nshelve, which requires to be marked out by a lighthouse, is generally at\r\nno great distance from the most magnificent scenery of rocks, caves, and\r\nbillows. Our time, too, was at our own disposal, and, as most of us were\r\nfreshwater sailors, we could at any time make a fair wind out of a foul\r\none, and run before the gale in quest of some object of curiosity which\r\nlay under our lee.\r\n\r\nWith these purposes of public utility and some personal amusement in\r\nview, we left the port of Leith on the 26th July, 1814, ran along the\r\neast coast of Scotland, viewing its different curiosities, stood over to\r\nZetland and Orkney, where we were some time detained by the wonders of a\r\ncountry which displayed so much that was new to us; and having seen what\r\nwas curious in the Ultima Thule of the ancients, where the sun hardly\r\nthought it worth while to go to bed, since his rising was at this season\r\nso early, we doubled the extreme northern termination of Scotland, and\r\ntook a rapid survey of the Hebrides, where we found many kind friends.\r\nThere, that our little expedition might not want the dignity of danger,\r\nwe were favoured with a distant glimpse of what was said to be an\r\nAmerican cruiser, and had opportunity to consider what a pretty figure\r\nwe should have made had the voyage ended in our being carried captive\r\nto the United States. After visiting the romantic shores of Morven, and\r\nthe vicinity of Oban, we made a run to the coast of Ireland, and visited\r\nthe Giant's Causeway, that we might compare it with Staffa, which we had\r\nsurveyed in our course. At length, about the middle of September, we\r\nended our voyage in the Clyde, at the port of Greenock.\r\n\r\nAnd thus terminated our pleasant tour, to which our equipment gave\r\nunusual facilities, as the ship's company could form a strong boat's\r\ncrew, independent of those who might be left on board the vessel, which\r\npermitted us the freedom to land wherever our curiosity carried us. Let\r\nme add, while reviewing for a moment a sunny portion of my life, that\r\namong the six or seven friends who performed this voyage together, some\r\nof them doubtless of different tastes and pursuits, and remaining for\r\nseveral weeks on board a small vessel, there never occurred the\r\nslightest dispute or disagreement, each seeming anxious to submit his\r\nown particular wishes to those of his friends. By this mutual\r\naccommodation all the purposes of our little expedition were obtained,\r\nwhile for a time we might have adopted the lines of Allan Cunningham's\r\nfine sea-song,\r\n\r\n  \"The world of waters was our home,\r\n  And merry men were we!\"\r\n\r\nBut sorrow mixes her memorials with the purest remembrances of pleasure.\r\nOn returning from the voyage which had proved so satisfactory, I found\r\nthat fate had deprived her country most unexpectedly of a lady,\r\nqualified to adorn the high rank which she held, and who had long\r\nadmitted me to a share of her friendship. The subsequent loss of one of\r\nthose comrades who made up the party, and he the most intimate friend I\r\nhad in the world, casts also its shade on recollections which, but for\r\nthese embitterments, would be otherwise so pleasing.\r\n\r\nI may here briefly observe, that my business in this voyage, so far as I\r\ncould be said to have any, was to endeavour to discover some localities\r\nwhich might be useful in the \"Lord of the Isles,\" a poem with which I\r\nwas then threatening the public, and was afterwards printed without\r\nattaining remarkable success. But as at the same time the anonymous\r\nnovel of \"Waverley\" was making its way to popularity, I already augured\r\nthe possibility of a second effort in this department of literature, and\r\nI saw much in the wild islands of the Orkneys and Zetland, which I\r\njudged might be made in the highest degree interesting, should these\r\nisles ever become the scene of a narrative of fictitious events. I\r\nlearned the history of Gow the pirate from an old sibyl, (the subject of\r\na note, p. 326 of this volume,) whose principal subsistence was by a\r\ntrade in favourable winds, which she sold to mariners at Stromness.\r\nNothing could be more interesting than the kindness and hospitality of\r\nthe gentlemen of Zetland, which was to me the more affecting, as several\r\nof them had been friends and correspondents of my father.\r\n\r\nI was induced to go a generation or two farther back, to find materials\r\nfrom which I might trace the features of the old Norwegian Udaller, the\r\nScottish gentry having in general occupied the place of that primitive\r\nrace, and their language and peculiarities of manner having entirely\r\ndisappeared. The only difference now to be observed betwixt the gentry\r\nof these islands, and those of Scotland in general, is, that the wealth\r\nand property is more equally divided among our more northern countrymen,\r\nand that there exists among the resident proprietors no men of very\r\ngreat wealth, whose display of its luxuries might render the others\r\ndiscontented with their own lot. From the same cause of general\r\nequality of fortunes, and the cheapness of living, which is its natural\r\nconsequence, I found the officers of a veteran regiment who had\r\nmaintained the garrison at Fort Charlotte, in Lerwick, discomposed at\r\nthe idea of being recalled from a country where their pay, however\r\ninadequate to the expenses of a capital, was fully adequate to their\r\nwants, and it was singular to hear natives of merry England herself\r\nregretting their approaching departure from the melancholy isles of the\r\nUltima Thule.\r\n\r\nSuch are the trivial particulars attending the origin of that\r\npublication, which took place several years later than the agreeable\r\njourney from which it took its rise.\r\n\r\nThe state of manners which I have introduced in the romance, was\r\nnecessarily in a great degree imaginary, though founded in some measure\r\non slight hints, which, showing what was, seemed to give reasonable\r\nindication of what must once have been, the tone of the society in these\r\nsequestered but interesting islands.\r\n\r\nIn one respect I was judged somewhat hastily, perhaps, when the\r\ncharacter of Norna was pronounced by the critics a mere copy of Meg\r\nMerrilees. That I had fallen short of what I wished and desired to\r\nexpress is unquestionable, otherwise my object could not have been so\r\nwidely mistaken; nor can I yet think that any person who will take the\r\ntrouble of reading the Pirate with some attention, can fail to trace in\r\nNorna,--the victim of remorse and insanity, and the dupe of her own\r\nimposture, her mind, too, flooded with all the wild literature and\r\nextravagant superstitions of the north,--something distinct from the\r\nDumfries-shire gipsy, whose pretensions to supernatural powers are not\r\nbeyond those of a Norwood prophetess. The foundations of such a\r\ncharacter may be perhaps traced, though it be too true that the\r\nnecessary superstructure cannot have been raised upon them, otherwise\r\nthese remarks would have been unnecessary. There is also great\r\nimprobability in the statement of Norna's possessing power and\r\nopportunity to impress on others that belief in her supernatural gifts\r\nwhich distracted her own mind. Yet, amid a very credulous and ignorant\r\npopulation, it is astonishing what success may be attained by an\r\nimpostor, who is, at the same time, an enthusiast. It is such as to\r\nremind us of the couplet which assures us that\r\n\r\n  \"The pleasure is as great\r\n  In being cheated as to cheat.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed, as I have observed elsewhere, the professed explanation of a\r\ntale, where appearances or incidents of a supernatural character are\r\nreferred to natural causes, has often, in the winding up of the story, a\r\ndegree of improbability almost equal to an absolute goblin narrative.\r\nEven the genius of Mrs. Radcliffe could not always surmount this\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n  ABBOTSFORD,\r\n    _1st May, 1831._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADVERTISEMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe purpose of the following Narrative is to give a detailed and\r\naccurate account of certain remarkable incidents which took place in the\r\nOrkney Islands, concerning which the more imperfect traditions and\r\nmutilated records of the country only tell us the following erroneous\r\nparticulars:--\r\n\r\nIn the month of January, 1724-5, a vessel, called the Revenge, bearing\r\ntwenty large guns, and six smaller, commanded by JOHN GOW, or GOFFE, or\r\nSMITH, came to the Orkney Islands, and was discovered to be a pirate, by\r\nvarious acts of insolence and villainy committed by the crew. These were\r\nfor some time submitted to, the inhabitants of these remote islands not\r\npossessing arms nor means of resistance; and so bold was the Captain of\r\nthese banditti, that he not only came ashore, and gave dancing parties\r\nin the village of Stromness, but before his real character was\r\ndiscovered, engaged the affections, and received the troth-plight, of a\r\nyoung lady possessed of some property. A patriotic individual, JAMES\r\nFEA, younger of Clestron, formed the plan of securing the buccanier,\r\nwhich he effected by a mixture of courage and address, in consequence\r\nchiefly of Gow's vessel having gone on shore near the harbour of\r\nCalfsound, on the Island of Eda, not far distant from a house then\r\ninhabited by Mr. FEA. In the various stratagems by which Mr. FEA\r\ncontrived finally, at the peril of his life, (they being well armed and\r\ndesperate,) to make the whole pirates his prisoners, he was much aided\r\nby Mr. JAMES LAING, the grandfather of the late MALCOLM LAING, Esq., the\r\nacute and ingenious historian of Scotland during the 17th century.\r\n\r\nGow, and others of his crew, suffered, by sentence of the High Court of\r\nAdmiralty, the punishment their crimes had long deserved. He conducted\r\nhimself with great audacity when before the Court; and, from an account\r\nof the matter by an eye-witness, seems to have been subjected to some\r\nunusual severities, in order to compel him to plead. The words are\r\nthese: \"JOHN GOW would not plead, for which he was brought to the bar,\r\nand the Judge ordered that his thumbs should be squeezed by two men,\r\nwith a whip-cord, till it did break; and then it should be doubled, till\r\nit did again break, and then laid threefold, and that the executioners\r\nshould pull with their whole strength; which sentence Gow endured with a\r\ngreat deal of boldness.\" The next morning, (27th May, 1725,) when he had\r\nseen the terrible preparations for pressing him to death, his courage\r\ngave way, and he told the Marshal of Court, that he would not have given\r\nso much trouble, had he been assured of not being hanged in chains. He\r\nwas then tried, condemned, and executed, with others of his crew.\r\n\r\nIt is said, that the lady whose affections GOW had engaged, went up to\r\nLondon to see him before his death, and that, arriving too late, she had\r\nthe courage to request a sight of his dead body; and then, touching the\r\nhand of the corpse, she formally resumed the troth-plight which she had\r\nbestowed. Without going through this ceremony, she could not, according\r\nto the superstition of the country, have escaped a visit from the ghost\r\nof her departed lover, in the event of her bestowing upon any living\r\nsuitor the faith which she had plighted to the dead. This part of the\r\nlegend may serve as a curious commentary on the fine Scottish ballad,\r\nwhich begins,\r\n\r\n  \"There came a ghost to Margaret's door,\" &c.(_a_)[6]\r\n\r\nThe common account of this incident farther bears, that Mr. FEA, the\r\nspirited individual by whose exertions GOW'S career of iniquity was cut\r\nshort, was so far from receiving any reward from Government, that he\r\ncould not obtain even countenance enough to protect him against a\r\nvariety of sham suits, raised against him by Newgate solicitors, who\r\nacted in the name of GOW, and others of the pirate crew; and the various\r\nexpenses, vexatious prosecutions, and other legal consequences, in which\r\nhis gallant exploit involved him, utterly ruined his fortune, and his\r\nfamily; making his memory a notable example to all who shall in future\r\ntake pirates on their own authority.\r\n\r\nIt is to be supposed, for the honour of GEORGE the First's Government,\r\nthat the last circumstance, as well as the dates, and other particulars\r\nof the commonly received story, are inaccurate, since they will be found\r\ntotally irreconcilable with the following veracious narrative, compiled\r\nfrom materials to which he himself alone has had access, by\r\n\r\n                                               THE AUTHOR OF WAVERLEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[6] See Editor's Notes at the end of the Volume. Wherever a similar\r\nreference occurs, the reader will understand that the same direction\r\napplies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PIRATE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n  The storm had ceased its wintry roar,\r\n    Hoarse dash the billows of the sea;\r\n  But who on Thule's desert shore,\r\n    Cries, Have I burnt my harp for thee?\r\n\r\n                                                    MACNIEL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat long, narrow, and irregular island, usually called the mainland of\r\nZetland, because it is by far the largest of that Archipelago,\r\nterminates, as is well known to the mariners who navigate the stormy\r\nseas which surround the Thule of the ancients, in a cliff of immense\r\nheight, entitled Sumburgh-Head, which presents its bare scalp and naked\r\nsides to the weight of a tremendous surge, forming the extreme point of\r\nthe isle to the south-east. This lofty promontory is constantly exposed\r\nto the current of a strong and furious tide, which, setting in betwixt\r\nthe Orkney and Zetland Islands, and running with force only inferior to\r\nthat of the Pentland Frith, takes its name from the headland we have\r\nmentioned, and is called the Roost of Sumburgh; _roost_ being the phrase\r\nassigned in those isles to currents of this description.\r\n\r\nOn the land side, the promontory is covered with short grass, and slopes\r\nsteeply down to a little isthmus, upon which the sea has encroached in\r\ncreeks, which, advancing from either side of the island, gradually work\r\ntheir way forward, and seem as if in a short time they would form a\r\njunction, and altogether insulate Sumburgh-Head, when what is now a\r\ncape, will become a lonely mountain islet, severed from the mainland, of\r\nwhich it is at present the terminating extremity.\r\n\r\nMan, however, had in former days considered this as a remote or unlikely\r\nevent; for a Norwegian chief of other times, or, as other accounts said,\r\nand as the name of Jarlshof seemed to imply, an ancient Earl of the\r\nOrkneys had selected this neck of land as the place for establishing a\r\nmansion-house. It has been long entirely deserted, and the vestiges only\r\ncan be discerned with difficulty; for the loose sand, borne on the\r\ntempestuous gales of those stormy regions, has overblown, and almost\r\nburied, the ruins of the buildings; but in the end of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, a part of the Earl's mansion was still entire and habitable. It\r\nwas a rude building of rough stone, with nothing about it to gratify the\r\neye, or to excite the imagination; a large old-fashioned narrow house,\r\nwith a very steep roof, covered with flags composed of grey sandstone,\r\nwould perhaps convey the best idea of the place to a modern reader. The\r\nwindows were few, very small in size, and distributed up and down the\r\nbuilding with utter contempt of regularity. Against the main structure\r\nhad rested, in former times, certain smaller co-partments of the\r\nmansion-house, containing offices, or subordinate apartments, necessary\r\nfor the accommodation of the Earl's retainers and menials. But these had\r\nbecome ruinous; and the rafters had been taken down for fire-wood, or\r\nfor other purposes; the walls had given way in many places; and, to\r\ncomplete the devastation, the sand had already drifted amongst the\r\nruins, and filled up what had been once the chambers they contained, to\r\nthe depth of two or three feet.\r\n\r\nAmid this desolation, the inhabitants of Jarlshof had contrived, by\r\nconstant labour and attention, to keep in order a few roods of land,\r\nwhich had been enclosed as a garden, and which, sheltered by the walls\r\nof the house itself, from the relentless sea-blast, produced such\r\nvegetables as the climate could bring forth, or rather as the sea-gale\r\nwould permit to grow; for these islands experience even less of the\r\nrigour of cold than is encountered on the mainland of Scotland; but,\r\nunsheltered by a wall of some sort or other, it is scarce possible to\r\nraise even the most ordinary culinary vegetables; and as for shrubs or\r\ntrees, they are entirely out of the question, such is the force of the\r\nsweeping sea-blast.\r\n\r\nAt a short distance from the mansion, and near to the sea-beach, just\r\nwhere the creek forms a sort of imperfect harbour, in which lay three or\r\nfour fishing-boats, there were a few most wretched cottages for the\r\ninhabitants and tenants of the township of Jarlshof, who held the whole\r\ndistrict of the landlord upon such terms as were in those days usually\r\ngranted to persons of this description, and which, of course, were hard\r\nenough. The landlord himself resided upon an estate which he possessed\r\nin a more eligible situation, in a different part of the island, and\r\nseldom visited his possessions at Sumburgh-Head. He was an honest, plain\r\nZetland gentleman, somewhat passionate, the necessary result of being\r\nsurrounded by dependents; and somewhat over-convivial in his habits, the\r\nconsequence, perhaps, of having too much time at his disposal; but\r\nfrank-tempered and generous to his people, and kind and hospitable to\r\nstrangers. He was descended also of an old and noble Norwegian family; a\r\ncircumstance which rendered him dearer to the lower orders, most of whom\r\nare of the same race; while the lairds, or proprietors, are generally of\r\nScottish extraction, who, at that early period, were still considered as\r\nstrangers and intruders. Magnus Troil, who deduced his descent from the\r\nvery Earl who was supposed to have founded Jarlshof, was peculiarly of\r\nthis opinion.\r\n\r\nThe present inhabitants of Jarlshof had experienced, on several\r\noccasions, the kindness and good will of the proprietor of the\r\nterritory. When Mr. Mertoun--such was the name of the present inhabitant\r\nof the old mansion--first arrived in Zetland, some years before the\r\nstory commences, he had been received at the house of Mr. Troil with\r\nthat warm and cordial hospitality for which the islands are\r\ndistinguished. No one asked him whence he came, where he was going, what\r\nwas his purpose in visiting so remote a corner of the empire, or what\r\nwas likely to be the term of his stay. He arrived a perfect stranger,\r\nyet was instantly overpowered by a succession of invitations; and in\r\neach house which he visited, he found a home as long as he chose to\r\naccept it, and lived as one of the family, unnoticed and unnoticing,\r\nuntil he thought proper to remove to some other dwelling. This apparent\r\nindifference to the rank, character, and qualities of their guest, did\r\nnot arise from apathy on the part of his kind hosts, for the islanders\r\nhad their full share of natural curiosity; but their delicacy deemed it\r\nwould be an infringement upon the laws of hospitality, to ask questions\r\nwhich their guest might have found it difficult or unpleasing to answer;\r\nand instead of endeavouring, as is usual in other countries, to wring\r\nout of Mr. Mertoun such communications as he might find it agreeable to\r\nwithhold, the considerate Zetlanders contented themselves with eagerly\r\ngathering up such scraps of information as could be collected in the\r\ncourse of conversation.\r\n\r\nBut the rock in an Arabian desert is not more reluctant to afford water,\r\nthan Mr. Basil Mertoun was niggard in imparting his confidence, even\r\nincidentally; and certainly the politeness of the gentry of Thule was\r\nnever put to a more severe test than when they felt that good-breeding\r\nenjoined them to abstain from enquiring into the situation of so\r\nmysterious a personage.\r\n\r\nAll that was actually known of him was easily summed up. Mr. Mertoun had\r\ncome to Lerwick, then rising into some importance, but not yet\r\nacknowledged as the principal town of the island, in a Dutch vessel,\r\naccompanied only by his son, a handsome boy of about fourteen years old.\r\nHis own age might exceed forty. The Dutch skipper introduced him to some\r\nof the very good friends with whom he used to barter gin and gingerbread\r\nfor little Zetland bullocks, smoked geese, and stockings of lambs-wool;\r\nand although Meinheer could only say, that \"Meinheer Mertoun hab bay his\r\nbassage like one gentlemans, and hab given a Kreitz-dollar beside to the\r\ncrew,\" this introduction served to establish the Dutchman's passenger in\r\na respectable circle of acquaintances, which gradually enlarged, as it\r\nappeared that the stranger was a man of considerable acquirements.\r\n\r\nThis discovery was made almost _per force_; for Mertoun was as unwilling\r\nto speak upon general subjects, as upon his own affairs. But he was\r\nsometimes led into discussions, which showed, as it were in spite of\r\nhimself, the scholar and the man of the world; and, at other times, as\r\nif in requital of the hospitality which he experienced, he seemed to\r\ncompel himself, against his fixed nature, to enter into the society of\r\nthose around him, especially when it assumed the grave, melancholy, or\r\nsatirical cast, which best suited the temper of his own mind. Upon such\r\noccasions, the Zetlanders were universally of opinion that he must have\r\nhad an excellent education, neglected only in one striking particular,\r\nnamely, that Mr. Mertoun scarce knew the stem of a ship from the stern;\r\nand in the management of a boat, a cow could not be more ignorant. It\r\nseemed astonishing such gross ignorance of the most necessary art of\r\nlife (in the Zetland Isles at least) should subsist along with his\r\naccomplishments in other respects; but so it was.\r\n\r\nUnless called forth in the manner we have mentioned, the habits of Basil\r\nMertoun were retired and gloomy. From loud mirth he instantly fled; and\r\neven the moderated cheerfulness of a friendly party, had the invariable\r\neffect of throwing him into deeper dejection than even his usual\r\ndemeanour indicated.\r\n\r\nWomen are always particularly desirous of investigating mystery, and of\r\nalleviating melancholy, especially when these circumstances are united\r\nin a handsome man about the prime of life. It is possible, therefore,\r\nthat amongst the fair-haired and blue-eyed daughters of Thule, this\r\nmysterious and pensive stranger might have found some one to take upon\r\nherself the task of consolation, had he shown any willingness to accept\r\nsuch kindly offices; but, far from doing so, he seemed even to shun the\r\npresence of the sex, to which in our distresses, whether of mind or\r\nbody, we generally apply for pity and comfort.\r\n\r\nTo these peculiarities Mr. Mertoun added another, which was particularly\r\ndisagreeable to his host and principal patron, Magnus Troil. This\r\nmagnate of Zetland, descended by the father's side, as we have already\r\nsaid, from an ancient Norwegian family, by the marriage of its\r\nrepresentative with a Danish lady, held the devout opinion that a cup of\r\nGeneva or Nantz was specific against all cares and afflictions whatever.\r\nThese were remedies to which Mr. Mertoun never applied; his drink was\r\nwater, and water alone, and no persuasion or entreaties could induce him\r\nto taste any stronger beverage than was afforded by the pure spring. Now\r\nthis Magnus Troil could not tolerate; it was a defiance to the ancient\r\nnorthern laws of conviviality, which, for his own part, he had so\r\nrigidly observed, that although he was wont to assert that he had never\r\nin his life gone to bed drunk, (that is, in his own sense of the word,)\r\nit would have been impossible to prove that he had ever resigned himself\r\nto slumber in a state of actual and absolute sobriety. It may be\r\ntherefore asked, What did this stranger bring into society to compensate\r\nthe displeasure given by his austere and abstemious habits? He had, in\r\nthe first place, that manner and self-importance which mark a person of\r\nsome consequence: and although it was conjectured that he could not be\r\nrich, yet it was certainly known by his expenditure that neither was he\r\nabsolutely poor. He had, besides, some powers of conversation, when, as\r\nwe have already hinted, he chose to exert them, and his misanthropy or\r\naversion to the business and intercourse of ordinary life, was often\r\nexpressed in an antithetical manner, which passed for wit, when better\r\nwas not to be had. Above all, Mr. Mertoun's secret seemed impenetrable,\r\nand his presence had all the interest of a riddle, which men love to\r\nread over and over, because they cannot find out the meaning of it.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these recommendations, Mertoun differed in so many\r\nmaterial points from his host, that after he had been for some time a\r\nguest at his principal residence, Magnus Troil was agreeably surprised\r\nwhen, one evening after they had sat two hours in absolute silence,\r\ndrinking brandy and water,--that is, Magnus drinking the alcohol, and\r\nMertoun the element,--the guest asked his host's permission to occupy,\r\nas his tenant, this deserted mansion of Jarlshof, at the extremity of\r\nthe territory called Dunrossness, and situated just beneath\r\nSumburgh-Head. \"I shall be handsomely rid of him,\" quoth Magnus to\r\nhimself, \"and his kill-joy visage will never again stop the bottle in\r\nits round. His departure will ruin me in lemons, however, for his mere\r\nlook was quite sufficient to sour a whole ocean of punch.\"\r\n\r\nYet the kind-hearted Zetlander generously and disinterestedly\r\nremonstrated with Mr. Mertoun on the solitude and inconveniences to\r\nwhich he was about to subject himself. \"There were scarcely,\" he said,\r\n\"even the most necessary articles of furniture in the old house--there\r\nwas no society within many miles--for provisions, the principal article\r\nof food would be sour sillocks, and his only company gulls and\r\ngannets.\"\r\n\r\n\"My good friend,\" replied Mertoun, \"if you could have named a\r\ncircumstance which would render the residence more eligible to me than\r\nany other, it is that there would be neither human luxury nor human\r\nsociety near the place of my retreat; a shelter from the weather for my\r\nown head, and for the boy's, is all I seek for. So name your rent, Mr.\r\nTroil, and let me be your tenant at Jarlshof.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rent?\" answered the Zetlander; \"why, no great rent for an old house\r\nwhich no one has lived in since my mother's time--God rest her!--and as\r\nfor shelter, the old walls are thick enough, and will bear many a bang\r\nyet. But, Heaven love you, Mr. Mertoun, think what you are purposing.\r\nFor one of us to live at Jarlshof, were a wild scheme enough; but you,\r\nwho are from another country, whether English, Scotch, or Irish, no one\r\ncan tell\"----\r\n\r\n\"Nor does it greatly matter,\" said Mertoun, somewhat abruptly.\r\n\r\n\"Not a herring's scale,\" answered the Laird; \"only that I like you the\r\nbetter for being no Scot, as I trust you are not one. Hither they have\r\ncome like the clack-geese--every chamberlain has brought over a flock of\r\nhis own name, and his own hatching, for what I know, and here they roost\r\nfor ever--catch them returning to their own barren Highlands or\r\nLowlands, when once they have tasted our Zetland beef, and seen our\r\nbonny _voes_ and lochs. No, sir,\" (here Magnus proceeded with great\r\nanimation, sipping from time to time the half-diluted spirit, which at\r\nthe same time animated his resentment against the intruders, and enabled\r\nhim to endure the mortifying reflection which it suggested,)--\"No, sir,\r\nthe ancient days and the genuine manners of these Islands are no more;\r\nfor our ancient possessors,--our Patersons, our Feas, our\r\nSchlagbrenners, our Thorbiorns, have given place to Giffords, Scotts,\r\nMouats, men whose names bespeak them or their ancestors strangers to the\r\nsoil which we the Troils have inhabited long before the days of\r\nTurf-Einar, who first taught these Isles the mystery of burning peat for\r\nfuel, and who has been handed down to a grateful posterity by a name\r\nwhich records the discovery.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a subject upon which the potentate of Jarlshof was usually very\r\ndiffuse, and Mertoun saw him enter upon it with pleasure, because he\r\nknew he should not be called upon to contribute any aid to the\r\nconversation, and might therefore indulge his own saturnine humour while\r\nthe Norwegian Zetlander declaimed on the change of times and\r\ninhabitants. But just as Magnus had arrived at the melancholy\r\nconclusion, \"how probable it was, that in another century scarce a\r\n_merk_--scarce even an _ure_ of land, would be in the possession of the\r\nNorse inhabitants, the true Udallers[7] of Zetland,\" he recollected the\r\ncircumstances of his guest, and stopped suddenly short. \"I do not say\r\nall this,\" he added, interrupting himself, \"as if I were unwilling that\r\nyou should settle on my estate, Mr. Mertoun--But for Jarlshof--the place\r\nis a wild one--Come from where you will, I warrant you will say, like\r\nother travellers, you came from a better climate than ours, for so say\r\nyou all. And yet you think of a retreat, which the very natives run away\r\nfrom. Will you not take your glass?\"--(This was to be considered as\r\ninterjectional,)--\"then here's to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"My good sir,\" answered Mertoun, \"I am indifferent to climate; if there\r\nis but air enough to fill my lungs, I care not if it be the breath of\r\nArabia or of Lapland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Air enough you may have,\" answered Magnus, \"no lack of that--somewhat\r\ndamp, strangers allege it to be, but we know a corrective for\r\nthat--Here's to you, Mr. Mertoun--You must learn to _do so_, and to\r\nsmoke a pipe; and then, as you say, you will find the air of Zetland\r\nequal to that of Arabia. But have you seen Jarlshof?\"\r\n\r\nThe stranger intimated that he had not.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" replied Magnus, \"you have no idea of your undertaking. If you\r\nthink it a comfortable roadstead like this, with the house situated on\r\nthe side of an inland voe,[8] that brings the herrings up to your door,\r\nyou are mistaken, my heart. At Jarlshof you will see nought but the wild\r\nwaves tumbling on the bare rocks, and the Roost of Sumburgh running at\r\nthe rate of fifteen knots an-hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall see nothing at least of the current of human passions,\" replied\r\nMertoun.\r\n\r\n\"You will hear nothing but the clanging and screaming of scarts,\r\nsheer-waters, and seagulls, from daybreak till sunset.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will compound, my friend,\" replied the stranger, \"so that I do not\r\nhear the chattering of women's tongues.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah,\" said the Norman, \"that is because you hear just now my little\r\nMinna and Brenda singing in the garden with your Mordaunt. Now, I would\r\nrather listen to their little voices, than the skylark which I once\r\nheard in Caithness, or the nightingale that I have read of.--What will\r\nthe girls do for want of their playmate Mordaunt?\"\r\n\r\n\"They will shift for themselves,\" answered Mertoun; \"younger or elder\r\nthey will find playmates or dupes.--But the question is, Mr. Troil, will\r\nyou let to me, as your tenant, this old mansion of Jarlshof?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gladly, since you make it your option to live in a spot so desolate.\"\r\n\r\n\"And as for the rent?\" continued Mertoun.\r\n\r\n\"The rent?\" replied Magnus; \"hum--why, you must have the bit of _plantie\r\ncruive_,[9] which they once called a garden, and a right in the\r\n_scathold_, and a sixpenny merk of land, that the tenants may fish for\r\nyou;--eight _lispunds_[10] of butter, and eight shillings sterling\r\nyearly, is not too much?\"\r\n\r\nMr. Mertoun agreed to terms so moderate, and from thenceforward resided\r\nchiefly at the solitary mansion which we have described in the beginning\r\nof this chapter, conforming not only without complaint, but, as it\r\nseemed, with a sullen pleasure, to all the privations which so wild and\r\ndesolate a situation necessarily imposed on its inhabitant.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] The Udallers are the _allodial_ possessors of Zetland, who hold\r\ntheir possessions under the old Norwegian law, instead of the feudal\r\ntenures introduced among them from Scotland.\r\n\r\n[8] Salt-water lake.\r\n\r\n[9] Patch of ground for vegetables. The liberal custom of the country\r\npermits any person, who has occasion for such a convenience, to select\r\nout of the unenclosed moorland a small patch, which he surrounds with a\r\ndrystone wall, and cultivates as a kailyard, till he exhausts the soil\r\nwith cropping, and then he deserts it, and encloses another. This\r\nliberty is so far from inferring an invasion of the right of proprietor\r\nand tenant, that the last degree of contempt is inferred of an\r\navaricious man, when a Zetlander says he would not hold a _plantie\r\ncruive_ of him.\r\n\r\n[10] A lispund is about thirty pounds English, and the value is averaged\r\nby Dr. Edmonston at ten shillings sterling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n  'Tis not alone the scene--the man, Anselmo,\r\n  The man finds sympathies in these wild wastes,\r\n  And roughly tumbling seas, which fairer views\r\n  And smoother waves deny him.\r\n\r\n                                            _Ancient Arama._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe few inhabitants of the township of Jarlshof had at first heard with\r\nalarm, that a person of rank superior to their own was come to reside in\r\nthe ruinous tenement, which they still called the Castle. In those days\r\n(for the present times are greatly altered for the better) the presence\r\nof a superior, in such a situation, was almost certain to be attended\r\nwith additional burdens and exactions, for which, under one pretext or\r\nanother, feudal customs furnished a thousand apologies. By each of\r\nthese, a part of the tenants' hard-won and precarious profits was\r\ndiverted for the use of their powerful neighbour and superior, the\r\ntacksman, as he was called. But the sub-tenants speedily found that no\r\noppression of this kind was to be apprehended at the hands of Basil\r\nMertoun. His own means, whether large or small, were at least fully\r\nadequate to his expenses, which, so far as regarded his habits of life,\r\nwere of the most frugal description. The luxuries of a few books, and\r\nsome philosophical instruments, with which he was supplied from London\r\nas occasion offered, seemed to indicate a degree of wealth unusual in\r\nthose islands; but, on the other hand, the table and the accommodations\r\nat Jarlshof, did not exceed what was maintained by a Zetland proprietor\r\nof the most inferior description.\r\n\r\nThe tenants of the hamlet troubled themselves very little about the\r\nquality of their superior, as soon as they found that their situation\r\nwas rather to be mended than rendered worse by his presence; and, once\r\nrelieved from the apprehension of his tyrannizing over them, they laid\r\ntheir heads together to make the most of him by various petty tricks of\r\novercharge and extortion, which for a while the stranger submitted to\r\nwith the most philosophic indifference. An incident, however, occurred,\r\nwhich put his character in a new light, and effectually checked all\r\nfuture efforts at extravagant imposition.\r\n\r\nA dispute arose in the kitchen of the Castle betwixt an old governante,\r\nwho acted as housekeeper to Mr. Mertoun, and Sweyn Erickson, as good a\r\nZetlander as ever rowed a boat to the _haaf_ fishing;[11] which dispute,\r\nas is usual in such cases, was maintained with such increasing heat and\r\nvociferation as to reach the ears of the master, (as he was called,)\r\nwho, secluded in a solitary turret, was deeply employed in examining the\r\ncontents of a new package of books from London, which, after long\r\nexpectation, had found its way to Hull, from thence by a whaling vessel\r\nto Lerwick, and so to Jarlshof. With more than the usual thrill of\r\nindignation which indolent people always feel when roused into action on\r\nsome unpleasant occasion, Mertoun descended to the scene of contest, and\r\nso suddenly, peremptorily, and strictly, enquired into the cause of\r\ndispute, that the parties, notwithstanding every evasion which they\r\nattempted, became unable to disguise from him, that their difference\r\nrespected the several interests to which the honest governante, and no\r\nless honest fisherman, were respectively entitled, in an overcharge of\r\nabout one hundred per cent on a bargain of rock-cod, purchased by the\r\nformer from the latter, for the use of the family at Jarlshof.\r\n\r\nWhen this was fairly ascertained and confessed, Mr. Mertoun stood\r\nlooking upon the culprits with eyes in which the utmost scorn seemed to\r\ncontend with awakening passion. \"Hark you, ye old hag,\" said he at\r\nlength to the housekeeper, \"avoid my house this instant! and know that I\r\ndismiss you, not for being a liar, a thief, and an ungrateful\r\nquean,--for these are qualities as proper to you as your name of\r\nwoman,--but for daring, in my house, to scold above your breath.--And\r\nfor you, you rascal, who suppose you may cheat a stranger as you would\r\n_flinch_[12] a whale, know that I am well acquainted with the rights\r\nwhich, by delegation from your master, Magnus Troil, I can exercise over\r\nyou, if I will. Provoke me to a certain pitch, and you shall learn, to\r\nyour cost, I can break your rest as easily as you can interrupt my\r\nleisure. I know the meaning of _scat_, and _wattle_, and _hawkhen_, and\r\n_hagalef_,(_b_) and every other exaction, by which your lords, in\r\nancient and modern days, have wrung your withers; nor is there one of\r\nyou that shall not rue the day that you could not be content with\r\nrobbing me of my money, but must also break in on my leisure with your\r\natrocious northern clamour, that rivals in discord the screaming of a\r\nflight of Arctic gulls.\"\r\n\r\nNothing better occurred to Sweyn, in answer to this objurgation, than\r\nthe preferring a humble request that his honour would be pleased to\r\nkeep the cod-fish without payment, and say no more about the matter; but\r\nby this time Mr. Mertoun had worked up his passions into an ungovernable\r\nrage, and with one hand he threw the money at the fisherman's head,\r\nwhile with the other he pelted him out of the apartment with his own\r\nfish, which he finally flung out of doors after him.\r\n\r\nThere was so much of appalling and tyrannic fury in the stranger's\r\nmanner on this occasion, that Sweyn neither stopped to collect the money\r\nnor take back his commodity, but fled at a precipitate rate to the small\r\nhamlet, to tell his comrades that if they provoked Master Mertoun any\r\nfarther, he would turn an absolute Pate Stewart[13] on their hand, and\r\nhead and hang without either judgment or mercy.\r\n\r\nHither also came the discarded housekeeper, to consult with her\r\nneighbours and kindred (for she too was a native of the village) what\r\nshe should do to regain the desirable situation from which she had been\r\nso suddenly expelled. The old Ranzellaar of the village, who had the\r\nvoice most potential in the deliberations of the township, after hearing\r\nwhat had happened, pronounced that Sweyn Erickson had gone too far in\r\nraising the market upon Mr. Mertoun; and that whatever pretext the\r\ntacksman might assume for thus giving way to his anger, the real\r\ngrievance must have been the charging the rock cod-fish at a penny\r\ninstead of a half-penny a-pound; he therefore exhorted all the community\r\nnever to raise their exactions in future beyond the proportion of\r\nthreepence upon the shilling, at which rate their master at the Castle\r\ncould not reasonably be expected to grumble, since, as he was disposed\r\nto do them no harm, it was reasonable to think that, in a moderate way,\r\nhe had no objection to do them good. \"And three upon twelve,\" said the\r\nexperienced Ranzellaar, \"is a decent and moderate profit, and will bring\r\nwith it God's blessing and Saint Ronald's.\"\r\n\r\nProceeding upon the tariff thus judiciously recommended to them, the\r\ninhabitants of Jarlshof cheated Mertoun in future only to the moderate\r\nextent of twenty-five per cent; a rate to which all nabobs,\r\narmy-contractors, speculators in the funds, and others, whom recent and\r\nrapid success has enabled to settle in the country upon a great scale,\r\nought to submit, as very reasonable treatment at the hand of their\r\nrustic neighbours. Mertoun at least seemed of that opinion, for he gave\r\nhimself no farther trouble upon the subject of his household expenses.\r\n\r\nThe conscript fathers of Jarlshof, having settled their own matters,\r\ntook next under their consideration the case of Swertha, the banished\r\nmatron who had been expelled from the Castle, whom, as an experienced\r\nand useful ally, they were highly desirous to restore to her office of\r\nhousekeeper, should that be found possible. But as their wisdom here\r\nfailed them, Swertha, in despair, had recourse to the good offices of\r\nMordaunt Mertoun, with whom she had acquired some favour by her\r\nknowledge in old Norwegian ballads, and dismal tales concerning the\r\nTrows or Drows, (the dwarfs of the Scalds,) with whom superstitious eld\r\nhad peopled many a lonely cavern and brown dale in Dunrossness, as in\r\nevery other district of Zetland. \"Swertha,\" said the youth, \"I can do\r\nbut little for you, but you may do something for yourself. My father's\r\npassion resembles the fury of those ancient champions, those Berserkars,\r\nyou sing songs about.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, fish of my heart,\" replied the old woman, with a pathetic\r\nwhine; \"the Berserkars(_c_) were champions who lived before the blessed\r\ndays of Saint Olave, and who used to run like madmen on swords, and\r\nspears, and harpoons, and muskets, and snap them all into pieces, as a\r\nfinner[14] would go through a herring-net, and then, when the fury went\r\noff, they were as weak and unstable as water.\"[15]\r\n\r\n\"That's the very thing, Swertha,\" said Mordaunt. \"Now, my father never\r\nlikes to think of his passion after it is over, and is so much of a\r\nBerserkar, that, let him be desperate as he will to-day, he will not\r\ncare about it to-morrow. Therefore, he has not filled up your place in\r\nthe household at the Castle, and not a mouthful of warm food has been\r\ndressed there since you went away, and not a morsel of bread baked, but\r\nwe have lived just upon whatever cold thing came to hand. Now, Swertha,\r\nI will be your warrant, that if you go boldly up to the Castle, and\r\nenter upon the discharge of your duties as usual, you will never hear a\r\nsingle word from him.\"\r\n\r\nSwertha hesitated at first to obey this bold counsel. She said, \"to her\r\nthinking, Mr. Mertoun, when he was angry, looked more like a fiend than\r\nany Berserkar of them all; that the fire flashed from his eyes, and the\r\nfoam flew from his lips; and that it would be a plain tempting of\r\nProvidence to put herself again in such a venture.\"\r\n\r\nBut, on the encouragement which she received from the son, she\r\ndetermined at length once more to face the parent; and, dressing herself\r\nin her ordinary household attire, for so Mordaunt particularly\r\nrecommended, she slipped into the Castle, and presently resuming the\r\nvarious and numerous occupations which devolved on her, seemed as deeply\r\nengaged in household cares as if she had never been out of office.\r\n\r\nThe first day of her return to her duty, Swertha made no appearance in\r\npresence of her master, but trusted that after his three days' diet on\r\ncold meat, a hot dish, dressed with the best of her simple skill, might\r\nintroduce her favourably to his recollection. When Mordaunt had reported\r\nthat his father had taken no notice of this change of diet, and when she\r\nherself observed that in passing and repassing him occasionally, her\r\nappearance produced no effect upon her singular master, she began to\r\nimagine that the whole affair had escaped Mr. Mertoun's memory, and was\r\nactive in her duty as usual. Neither was she convinced of the contrary\r\nuntil one day, when, happening somewhat to elevate her tone in a dispute\r\nwith the other maid-servant, her master, who at that time passed the\r\nplace of contest, eyed her with a strong glance, and pronounced the\r\nsingle word, _Remember!_ in a tone which taught Swertha the government\r\nof her tongue for many weeks after.\r\n\r\nIf Mertoun was whimsical in his mode of governing his household, he\r\nseemed no less so in his plan of educating his son. He showed the youth\r\nbut few symptoms of parental affection; yet, in his ordinary state of\r\nmind, the improvement of Mordaunt's education seemed to be the utmost\r\nobject of his life. He had both books and information sufficient to\r\ndischarge the task of tutor in the ordinary branches of knowledge; and\r\nin this capacity was regular, calm, and strict, not to say severe, in\r\nexacting from his pupil the attention necessary for his profiting. But\r\nin the perusal of history, to which their attention was frequently\r\nturned, as well as in the study of classic authors, there often occurred\r\nfacts or sentiments which produced an instant effect upon Mertoun's\r\nmind, and brought on him suddenly what Swertha, Sweyn, and even\r\nMordaunt, came to distinguish by the name of his dark hour. He was\r\naware, in the usual case, of its approach, and retreated to an inner\r\napartment, into which he never permitted even Mordaunt to enter. Here he\r\nwould abide in seclusion for days, and even weeks, only coming out at\r\nuncertain times, to take such food as they had taken care to leave\r\nwithin his reach, which he used in wonderfully small quantities. At\r\nother times, and especially during the winter solstice, when almost\r\nevery person spends the gloomy time within doors in feasting and\r\nmerriment, this unhappy man would wrap himself in a dark-coloured\r\nsea-cloak, and wander out along the stormy beach, or upon the desolate\r\nheath, indulging his own gloomy and wayward reveries under the inclement\r\nsky, the rather that he was then most sure to wander unencountered and\r\nunobserved.\r\n\r\nAs Mordaunt grew older, he learned to note the particular signs which\r\npreceded these fits of gloomy despondency, and to direct such\r\nprecautions as might ensure his unfortunate parent from ill-timed\r\ninterruption, (which had always the effect of driving him to fury,)\r\nwhile, at the same time, full provision was made for his subsistence.\r\nMordaunt perceived that at such periods the melancholy fit of his father\r\nwas greatly prolonged, if he chanced to present himself to his eyes\r\nwhile the dark hour was upon him. Out of respect, therefore, to his\r\nparent, as well as to indulge the love of active exercise and of\r\namusement natural to his period of life, Mordaunt used often to absent\r\nhimself altogether from the mansion of Jarlshof, and even from the\r\ndistrict, secure that his father, if the dark hour passed away in his\r\nabsence, would be little inclined to enquire how his son had disposed of\r\nhis leisure, so that he was sure he had not watched his own weak\r\nmoments; that being the subject on which he entertained the utmost\r\njealousy.\r\n\r\nAt such times, therefore, all the sources of amusement which the country\r\nafforded, were open to the younger Mertoun, who, in these intervals of\r\nhis education, had an opportunity to give full scope to the energies of\r\na bold, active, and daring character. He was often engaged with the\r\nyouth of the hamlet in those desperate sports, to which the \"dreadful\r\ntrade of the samphire-gatherer\" is like a walk upon level ground--often\r\njoined those midnight excursions upon the face of the giddy cliffs, to\r\nsecure the eggs or the young of the sea-fowl; and in these daring\r\nadventures displayed an address, presence of mind, and activity, which,\r\nin one so young, and not a native of the country, astonished the oldest\r\nfowlers.[16]\r\n\r\nAt other times, Mordaunt accompanied Sweyn and other fishermen in their\r\nlong and perilous expeditions to the distant and deep sea, learning\r\nunder their direction the management of the boat, in which they equal,\r\nor exceed, perhaps, any natives of the British empire. This exercise had\r\ncharms for Mordaunt, independently of the fishing alone.\r\n\r\nAt this time, the old Norwegian sagas were much remembered, and often\r\nrehearsed, by the fishermen, who still preserved among themselves the\r\nancient Norse tongue, which was the speech of their forefathers. In the\r\ndark romance of those Scandinavian tales, lay much that was captivating\r\nto a youthful ear; and the classic fables of antiquity were rivalled at\r\nleast, if not excelled, in Mordaunt's opinion, by the strange legends of\r\nBerserkars, of Sea-kings, of dwarfs, giants, and sorcerers, which he\r\nheard from the native Zetlanders. Often the scenes around him were\r\nassigned as the localities of the wild poems, which, half recited, half\r\nchanted by voices as hoarse, if not so loud, as the waves over which\r\nthey floated, pointed out the very bay on which they sailed as the scene\r\nof a bloody sea-fight; the scarce-seen heap of stones that bristled over\r\nthe projecting cape, as the dun, or castle, of some potent earl or noted\r\npirate; the distant and solitary grey stone on the lonely moor, as\r\nmarking the grave of a hero; the wild cavern, up which the sea rolled in\r\nheavy, broad, and unbroken billows, as the dwelling of some noted\r\nsorceress.[17]\r\n\r\nThe ocean also had its mysteries, the effect of which was aided by the\r\ndim twilight, through which it was imperfectly seen for more than half\r\nthe year. Its bottomless depths and secret caves contained, according to\r\nthe account of Sweyn and others, skilled in legendary lore, such wonders\r\nas modern navigators reject with disdain. In the quiet moonlight bay,\r\nwhere the waves came rippling to the shore, upon a bed of smooth sand\r\nintermingled with shells, the mermaid was still seen to glide along the\r\nwaters, and, mingling her voice with the sighing breeze, was often heard\r\nto sing of subterranean wonders, or to chant prophecies of future\r\nevents. The kraken, that hugest of living things, was still supposed to\r\ncumber the recesses of the Northern Ocean; and often, when some fog-bank\r\ncovered the sea at a distance, the eye of the experienced boatman saw\r\nthe horns of the monstrous leviathan welking and waving amidst the\r\nwreaths of mist, and bore away with all press of oar and sail, lest the\r\nsudden suction, occasioned by the sinking of the monstrous mass to the\r\nbottom, should drag within the grasp of its multifarious feelers his own\r\nfrail skiff. The sea-snake was also known, which, arising out of the\r\ndepths of ocean, stretches to the skies his enormous neck, covered with\r\na mane like that of a war-horse, and with its broad glittering eyes,\r\nraised mast-head high, looks out, as it seems, for plunder or for\r\nvictims.\r\n\r\nMany prodigious stories of these marine monsters, and of many others\r\nless known, were then universally received among the Zetlanders, whose\r\ndescendants have not as yet by any means abandoned faith in them.[18]\r\n\r\nSuch legends are, indeed, everywhere current amongst the vulgar; but\r\nthe imagination is far more powerfully affected by them on the deep and\r\ndangerous seas of the north, amidst precipices and headlands, many\r\nhundred feet in height,--amid perilous straits, and currents, and\r\neddies,--long sunken reefs of rock, over which the vivid ocean foams and\r\nboils,--dark caverns, to whose extremities neither man nor skiff has\r\never ventured,--lonely, and often uninhabited isles,--and occasionally\r\nthe ruins of ancient northern fastnesses, dimly seen by the feeble light\r\nof the Arctic winter. To Mordaunt, who had much of romance in his\r\ndisposition, these superstitions formed a pleasing and interesting\r\nexercise of the imagination, while, half doubting, half inclined to\r\nbelieve, he listened to the tales chanted concerning these wonders of\r\nnature, and creatures of credulous belief, told in the rude but\r\nenergetic language of the ancient Scalds.\r\n\r\nBut there wanted not softer and lighter amusement, that might seem\r\nbetter suited to Mordaunt's age, than the wild tales and rude exercises\r\nwhich we have already mentioned. The season of winter, when, from the\r\nshortness of the daylight, labour becomes impossible, is in Zetland the\r\ntime of revel, feasting, and merriment. Whatever the fisherman has been\r\nable to acquire during summer, was expended, and often wasted, in\r\nmaintaining the mirth and hospitality of his hearth during this period;\r\nwhile the landholders and gentlemen of the island gave double loose to\r\ntheir convivial and hospitable dispositions, thronged their houses with\r\nguests, and drove away the rigour of the season with jest, glee, and\r\nsong, the dance, and the wine-cup.\r\n\r\nAmid the revels of this merry, though rigorous season, no youth added\r\nmore spirit to the dance, or glee to the revel, than the young stranger,\r\nMordaunt Mertoun. When his father's state of mind permitted, or indeed\r\nrequired, his absence, he wandered from house to house a welcome guest\r\nwhereever he came, and lent his willing voice to the song, and his foot\r\nto the dance. A boat, or, if the weather, as was often the case,\r\npermitted not that convenience, one of the numerous ponies, which,\r\nstraying in hordes about the extensive moors, may be said to be at any\r\nman's command who can catch them, conveyed him from the mansion of one\r\nhospitable Zetlander to that of another. None excelled him in performing\r\nthe warlike sword-dance, a species of amusement which had been derived\r\nfrom the habits of the ancient Norsemen. He could play upon the _gue_,\r\nand upon the common violin, the melancholy and pathetic tunes peculiar\r\nto the country; and with great spirit and execution could relieve their\r\nmonotony with the livelier airs of the North of Scotland. When a party\r\nset forth as maskers, or, as they are called in Scotland, _guizards_, to\r\nvisit some neighbouring Laird, or rich Udaller, it augured well of the\r\nexpedition if Mordaunt Mertoun could be prevailed upon to undertake the\r\noffice of _skudler_, or leader of the band. Upon these occasions, full\r\nof fun and frolic, he led his retinue from house to house, bringing\r\nmirth where he went, and leaving regret when he departed. Mordaunt\r\nbecame thus generally known and beloved as generally, through most of\r\nthe houses composing the patriarchal community of the Main Isle; but his\r\nvisits were most frequently and most willingly paid at the mansion of\r\nhis father's landlord and protector, Magnus Troil.\r\n\r\nIt was not entirely the hearty and sincere welcome of the worthy old\r\nMagnate, nor the sense that he was in effect his father's patron, which\r\noccasioned these frequent visits. The hand of welcome was indeed\r\nreceived as eagerly as it was sincerely given, while the ancient\r\nUdaller, raising himself in his huge chair, whereof the inside was lined\r\nwith well-dressed sealskins, and the outside composed of massive oak,\r\ncarved by the rude graving-tool of some Hamburgh carpenter, shouted\r\nforth his welcome in a tone, which might, in ancient times, have hailed\r\nthe return of _Ioul_, the highest festival of the Goths. There was metal\r\nyet more attractive, and younger hearts, whose welcome, if less loud,\r\nwas as sincere as that of the jolly Udaller. But this is matter which\r\nought not to be discussed at the conclusion of a chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[11] _i. e._ The deep-sea fishing, in distinction to that which is\r\npractised along shore.\r\n\r\n[12] The operation of slicing the blubber from the bones of the whale,\r\nis called, technically, _flinching_.\r\n\r\n[13] Meaning, probably, Patrick Stewart, Earl of Orkney, executed for\r\ntyranny and oppression practised on the inhabitants of those remote\r\nislands, in the beginning of the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\n[14] _Finner_, small whale.\r\n\r\n[15] The sagas of the Scalds are full of descriptions of these\r\nchampions, and do not permit us to doubt that the Berserkars, so called\r\nfrom fighting without armour, used some physical means of working\r\nthemselves into a frenzy, during which they possessed the strength and\r\nenergy of madness. The Indian warriors are well known to do the same by\r\ndint of opium and bang.\r\n\r\n[16] Fatal accidents, however, sometimes occur. When I visited the Fair\r\nIsle in 1814, a poor lad of fourteen had been killed by a fall from the\r\nrocks about a fortnight before our arrival. The accident happened almost\r\nwithin sight of his mother, who was casting peats at no great distance.\r\nThe body fell into the sea, and was seen no more. But the islanders\r\naccount this an honourable mode of death; and as the children begin the\r\npractice of climbing very early, fewer accidents occur than might be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n[17] Note I.--Norse Fragments.\r\n\r\n[18] Note II.--Monsters of the Northern Seas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  \"O, Bessy Bell and Mary Gray,\r\n    They were twa bonnie lasses;\r\n  They biggit a house on yon burn-brae,\r\n    And theekit it ower wi' rashes.\r\n\r\n  Fair Bessy Bell I looed yestreen,\r\n    And thought I ne'er could alter;\r\n  But Mary Gray's twa pawky een\r\n    Have garr'd my fancy falter.\"(_d_)\r\n\r\n                                               _Scots Song._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned Minna and Brenda, the daughters of Magnus\r\nTroil. Their mother had been dead for many years, and they were now two\r\nbeautiful girls, the eldest only eighteen, which might be a year or two\r\nyounger than Mordaunt Mertoun, the second about seventeen.--They were\r\nthe joy of their father's heart, and the light of his old eyes; and\r\nalthough indulged to a degree which might have endangered his comfort\r\nand their own, they repaid his affection with a love, into which even\r\nblind indulgence had not introduced slight regard, or feminine caprice.\r\nThe difference of their tempers and of their complexions was singularly\r\nstriking, although combined, as is usual, with a certain degree of\r\nfamily resemblance.\r\n\r\nThe mother of these maidens had been a Scottish lady from the Highlands\r\nof Sutherland, the orphan of a noble chief, who, driven from his own\r\ncountry during the feuds of the seventeenth century, had found shelter\r\nin those peaceful islands, which, amidst poverty and seclusion, were\r\nthus far happy, that they remained unvexed by discord, and unstained by\r\ncivil broil. The father (his name was Saint Clair) pined for his native\r\nglen, his feudal tower, his clansmen, and his fallen authority, and died\r\nnot long after his arrival in Zetland. The beauty of his orphan\r\ndaughter, despite her Scottish lineage, melted the stout heart of Magnus\r\nTroil. He sued and was listened to, and she became his bride; but dying\r\nin the fifth year of their union, left him to mourn his brief period of\r\ndomestic happiness.\r\n\r\nFrom her mother, Minna inherited the stately form and dark eyes, the\r\nraven locks and finely-pencilled brows, which showed she was, on one\r\nside at least, a stranger to the blood of Thule. Her cheek,--\r\n\r\n  \"O call it fair, not pale!\"\r\n\r\nwas so slightly and delicately tinged with the rose, that many thought\r\nthe lily had an undue proportion in her complexion. But in that\r\npredominance of the paler flower, there was nothing sickly or languid;\r\nit was the true natural colour of health, and corresponded in a peculiar\r\ndegree with features, which seemed calculated to express a contemplative\r\nand high-minded character. When Minna Troil heard a tale of woe or of\r\ninjustice, it was then her blood rushed to her cheeks, and showed\r\nplainly how warm it beat, notwithstanding the generally serious,\r\ncomposed, and retiring disposition, which her countenance and demeanour\r\nseemed to exhibit. If strangers sometimes conceived that these fine\r\nfeatures were clouded by melancholy, for which her age and situation\r\ncould scarce have given occasion, they were soon satisfied, upon\r\nfurther acquaintance, that the placid, mild quietude of her disposition,\r\nand the mental energy of a character which was but little interested in\r\nordinary and trivial occurrences, was the real cause of her gravity; and\r\nmost men, when they knew that her melancholy had no ground in real\r\nsorrow, and was only the aspiration of a soul bent on more important\r\nobjects than those by which she was surrounded, might have wished her\r\nwhatever could add to her happiness, but could scarce have desired that,\r\ngraceful as she was in her natural and unaffected seriousness, she\r\nshould change that deportment for one more gay. In short,\r\nnotwithstanding our wish to have avoided that hackneyed simile of an\r\nangel, we cannot avoid saying there was something in the serious beauty\r\nof her aspect, in the measured, yet graceful ease of her motions, in the\r\nmusic of her voice, and the serene purity of her eye, that seemed as if\r\nMinna Troil belonged naturally to some higher and better sphere, and was\r\nonly the chance visitant of a world that was not worthy of her.\r\n\r\nThe scarcely less beautiful, equally lovely, and equally innocent\r\nBrenda, was of a complexion as differing from her sister, as they\r\ndiffered in character, taste, and expression. Her profuse locks were of\r\nthat paly brown which receives from the passing sunbeam a tinge of gold,\r\nbut darkens again when the ray has passed from it. Her eye, her mouth,\r\nthe beautiful row of teeth, which in her innocent vivacity were\r\nfrequently disclosed; the fresh, yet not too bright glow of a healthy\r\ncomplexion, tinging a skin like the drifted snow, spoke her genuine\r\nScandinavian descent. A fairy form, less tall than that of Minna, but\r\nstill more finely moulded into symmetry--a careless, and almost\r\nchildish lightness of step--an eye that seemed to look on every object\r\nwith pleasure, from a natural and serene cheerfulness of disposition,\r\nattracted even more general admiration than the charms of her sister,\r\nthough perhaps that which Minna did excite might be of a more intense as\r\nwell as more reverential character.\r\n\r\nThe dispositions of these lovely sisters were not less different than\r\ntheir complexions. In the kindly affections, neither could be said to\r\nexcel the other, so much were they attached to their father and to each\r\nother. But the cheerfulness of Brenda mixed itself with the every-day\r\nbusiness of life, and seemed inexhaustible in its profusion. The less\r\nbuoyant spirit of her sister appeared to bring to society a contented\r\nwish to be interested and pleased with what was going forward, but was\r\nrather placidly carried along with the stream of mirth and pleasure,\r\nthan disposed to aid its progress by any efforts of her own. She endured\r\nmirth, rather than enjoyed it; and the pleasures in which she most\r\ndelighted, were those of a graver and more solitary cast. The knowledge\r\nwhich is derived from books was beyond her reach. Zetland afforded few\r\nopportunities, in those days, of studying the lessons, bequeathed\r\n\r\n  \"By dead men to their kind;\"\r\n\r\nand Magnus Troil, such as we have described him, was not a person within\r\nwhose mansion the means of such knowledge were to be acquired. But the\r\nbook of nature was before Minna, that noblest of volumes, where we are\r\never called to wonder and to admire, even when we cannot understand.\r\nThe plants of those wild regions, the shells on the shores, and the\r\nlong list of feathered clans which haunt their cliffs and eyries, were\r\nas well known to Minna Troil as to the most experienced fowlers. Her\r\npowers of observation were wonderful, and little interrupted by other\r\ntones of feeling. The information which she acquired by habits of\r\npatient attention, was indelibly riveted in a naturally powerful memory.\r\nShe had also a high feeling for the solitary and melancholy grandeur of\r\nthe scenes in which she was placed. The ocean, in all its varied forms\r\nof sublimity and terror--the tremendous cliffs that resound to the\r\nceaseless roar of the billows, and the clang of the sea-fowl, had for\r\nMinna a charm in almost every state in which the changing seasons\r\nexhibited them. With the enthusiastic feelings proper to the romantic\r\nrace from which her mother descended, the love of natural objects was to\r\nher a passion capable not only of occupying, but at times of agitating,\r\nher mind. Scenes upon which her sister looked with a sense of transient\r\nawe or emotion, which vanished on her return from witnessing them,\r\ncontinued long to fill Minna's imagination, not only in solitude, and in\r\nthe silence of the night, but in the hours of society. So that sometimes\r\nwhen she sat like a beautiful statue, a present member of the domestic\r\ncircle, her thoughts were far absent, wandering on the wild sea-shore,\r\nand among the yet wilder mountains of her native isles. And yet, when\r\nrecalled to conversation, and mingling in it with interest, there were\r\nfew to whom her friends were more indebted for enhancing its enjoyments;\r\nand although something in her manners claimed deference (notwithstanding\r\nher early youth) as well as affection, even her gay, lovely, and\r\namiable sister was not more generally beloved than the more retired and\r\npensive Minna.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the two lovely sisters were not only the delight of their\r\nfriends, but the pride of those islands, where the inhabitants of a\r\ncertain rank were blended, by the remoteness of their situation and the\r\ngeneral hospitality of their habits, into one friendly community. A\r\nwandering poet and parcel-musician, who, after going through various\r\nfortunes, had returned to end his days as he could in his native\r\nislands, had celebrated the daughters of Magnus in a poem, which he\r\nentitled Night and Day; and in his description of Minna, might almost be\r\nthought to have anticipated, though only in a rude outline, the\r\nexquisite lines of Lord Byron,--\r\n\r\n  \"She walks in beauty, like the night\r\n    Of cloudless climes and starry skies;\r\n  And all that's best of dark and bright\r\n    Meet in her aspect, and her eyes:\r\n  Thus mellow'd to that tender light\r\n    Which heaven to gaudy day denies.\"\r\n\r\nTheir father loved the maidens both so well, that it might be difficult\r\nto say which he loved best; saving that, perchance, he liked his graver\r\ndamsel better in the walk without doors, and his merry maiden better by\r\nthe fireside; that he more desired the society of Minna when he was sad,\r\nand that of Brenda when he was mirthful; and, what was nearly the same\r\nthing, preferred Minna before noon, and Brenda after the glass had\r\ncirculated in the evening.\r\n\r\nBut it was still more extraordinary, that the affections of Mordaunt\r\nMertoun seemed to hover with the same impartiality as those of their\r\nfather betwixt the two lovely sisters. From his boyhood, as we have\r\nnoticed, he had been a frequent inmate of the residence of Magnus at\r\nBurgh-Westra, although it lay nearly twenty miles distant from Jarlshof.\r\nThe impassable character of the country betwixt these places, extending\r\nover hills covered with loose and quaking bog, and frequently\r\nintersected by the creeks or arms of the sea, which indent the island on\r\neither side, as well as by fresh-water streams and lakes, rendered the\r\njourney difficult, and even dangerous, in the dark season; yet, as soon\r\nas the state of his father's mind warned him to absent himself,\r\nMordaunt, at every risk, and under every difficulty, was pretty sure to\r\nbe found the next day at Burgh-Westra, having achieved his journey in\r\nless time than would have been employed perhaps by the most active\r\nnative.\r\n\r\nHe was of course set down as a wooer of one of the daughters of Magnus,\r\nby the public of Zetland; and when the old Udaller's great partiality to\r\nthe youth was considered, nobody doubted that he might aspire to the\r\nhand of either of those distinguished beauties, with as large a share of\r\nislets, rocky moorland, and shore-fishings, as might be the fitting\r\nportion of a favoured child, and with the presumptive prospect of\r\npossessing half the domains of the ancient house of Troil, when their\r\npresent owner should be no more. This seemed all a reasonable\r\nspeculation, and, in theory at least, better constructed than many that\r\nare current through the world as unquestionable facts. But, alas! all\r\nthat sharpness of observation which could be applied to the conduct of\r\nthe parties, failed to determine the main point, to which of the young\r\npersons, namely, the attentions of Mordaunt were peculiarly devoted. He\r\nseemed, in general, to treat them as an affectionate and attached\r\nbrother might have treated two sisters, so equally dear to him that a\r\nbreath would have turned the scale of affection. Or if at any time,\r\nwhich often happened, the one maiden appeared the more especial object\r\nof his attention, it seemed only to be because circumstances called her\r\npeculiar talents and disposition into more particular and immediate\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\nBoth the sisters were accomplished in the simple music of the north, and\r\nMordaunt, who was their assistant, and sometimes their preceptor, when\r\nthey were practising this delightful art, might be now seen assisting\r\nMinna in the acquisition of those wild, solemn, and simple airs, to\r\nwhich scalds and harpers sung of old the deeds of heroes, and presently\r\nfound equally active in teaching Brenda the more lively and complicated\r\nmusic, which their father's affection caused to be brought from the\r\nEnglish or Scottish capital for the use of his daughters. And while\r\nconversing with them, Mordaunt, who mingled a strain of deep and ardent\r\nenthusiasm with the gay and ungovernable spirits of youth, was equally\r\nready to enter into the wild and poetical visions of Minna, or into the\r\nlively and often humorous chat of her gayer sister. In short, so little\r\ndid he seem to attach himself to either damsel exclusively, that he was\r\nsometimes heard to say, that Minna never looked so lovely, as when her\r\nlighthearted sister had induced her, for the time, to forget her\r\nhabitual gravity; or Brenda so interesting, as when she sat listening, a\r\nsubdued and affected partaker of the deep pathos of her sister Minna.\r\n\r\nThe public of the mainland were, therefore, to use the hunter's phrase,\r\nat fault in their farther conclusions, and could but determine, after\r\nlong vacillating betwixt the maidens, that the young man was positively\r\nto marry one of them, but which of the two could only be determined when\r\nhis approaching manhood, or the interference of stout old Magnus, the\r\nfather, should teach Master Mordaunt Mertoun to know his own mind. \"It\r\nwas a pretty thing, indeed,\" they usually concluded, \"that he, no native\r\nborn, and possessed of no visible means of subsistence that is known to\r\nany one, should presume to hesitate, or affect to have the power of\r\nselection and choice, betwixt the two most distinguished beauties of\r\nZetland. If they were Magnus Troil, they would soon be at the bottom of\r\nthe matter\"--and so forth. All which remarks were only whispered, for\r\nthe hasty disposition of the Udaller had too much of the old Norse fire\r\nabout it to render it safe for any one to become an unauthorized\r\nintermeddler with his family affairs; and thus stood the relation of\r\nMordaunt Mertoun to the family of Mr. Troil of Burgh-Westra, when the\r\nfollowing incidents took place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n  This is no pilgrim's morning--yon grey mist\r\n  Lies upon hill, and dale, and field, and forest,\r\n  Like the dun wimple of a new-made widow;\r\n  And, by my faith, although my heart be soft,\r\n  I'd rather hear that widow weep and sigh,\r\n  And tell the virtues of the dear departed,\r\n  Than, when the tempest sends his voice abroad,\r\n  Be subject to its fury.\r\n\r\n                                      _The Double Nuptials._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spring was far advanced, when, after a week spent in sport and\r\nfestivity at Burgh-Westra, Mordaunt Mertoun bade adieu to the family,\r\npleading the necessity of his return to Jarlshof. The proposal was\r\ncombated by the maidens, and more decidedly by Magnus himself: He saw no\r\noccasion whatever for Mordaunt returning to Jarlshof. If his father\r\ndesired to see him, which, by the way, Magnus did not believe, Mr.\r\nMertoun had only to throw himself into the stern of Sweyn's boat, or\r\nbetake himself to a pony, if he liked a land journey better, and he\r\nwould see not only his son, but twenty folk besides, who would be most\r\nhappy to find that he had not lost the use of his tongue entirely during\r\nhis long solitude; \"although I must own,\" added the worthy Udaller,\r\n\"that when he lived among us, nobody ever made less use of it.\"\r\n\r\nMordaunt acquiesced both in what respected his father's taciturnity, and\r\nhis dislike to general society; but suggested, at the same time, that\r\nthe first circumstance rendered his own immediate return more\r\nnecessary, as he was the usual channel of communication betwixt his\r\nfather and others; and that the second corroborated the same necessity,\r\nsince Mr. Mertoun's having no other society whatever seemed a weighty\r\nreason why his son's should be restored to him without loss of time. As\r\nto his father's coming to Burgh-Westra, \"they might as well,\" he said,\r\n\"expect to see Sumburgh Cape come thither.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that would be a cumbrous guest,\" said Magnus. \"But you will stop\r\nfor our dinner to-day? There are the families of Muness, Quendale,\r\nThorslivoe, and I know not who else, are expected; and, besides the\r\nthirty that were in house this blessed night, we shall have as many more\r\nas chamber and bower, and barn and boat-house, can furnish with beds, or\r\nwith barley-straw,--and you will leave all this behind you!\"\r\n\r\n\"And the blithe dance at night,\" added Brenda, in a tone betwixt\r\nreproach and vexation; \"and the young men from the Isle of Paba that are\r\nto dance the sword-dance, whom shall we find to match them, for the\r\nhonour of the Main?\"\r\n\r\n\"There is many a merry dancer on the mainland, Brenda,\" replied\r\nMordaunt, \"even if I should never rise on tiptoe again. And where good\r\ndancers are found, Brenda Troil will always find the best partner. I\r\nmust trip it to-night through the Wastes of Dunrossness.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not say so, Mordaunt,\" said Minna, who, during this conversation,\r\nhad been looking from the window something anxiously; \"go not, to-day at\r\nleast, through the Wastes of Dunrossness.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not to-day, Minna,\" said Mordaunt, laughing, \"any more than\r\nto-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, the morning mist lies heavy upon yonder chain of isles, nor has it\r\npermitted us since daybreak even a single glimpse of Fitful-head, the\r\nlofty cape that concludes yon splendid range of mountains. The fowl are\r\nwinging their way to the shore, and the shelldrake seems, through the\r\nmist, as large as the scart.[19] See, the very sheerwaters and bonxies\r\nare making to the cliffs for shelter.\"\r\n\r\n\"And they will ride out a gale against a king's frigate,\" said her\r\nfather; \"there is foul weather when they cut and run.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay, then, with us,\" said Minna to her friend; \"the storm will be\r\ndreadful, yet it will be grand to see it from Burgh-Westra, if we have\r\nno friend exposed to its fury. See, the air is close and sultry, though\r\nthe season is yet so early, and the day so calm, that not a windlestraw\r\nmoves on the heath. Stay with us, Mordaunt; the storm which these signs\r\nannounce will be a dreadful one.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must be gone the sooner,\" was the conclusion of Mordaunt, who could\r\nnot deny the signs, which had not escaped his own quick observation. \"If\r\nthe storm be too fierce, I will abide for the night at Stourburgh.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said Magnus; \"will you leave us for the new chamberlain's new\r\nScotch tacksman, who is to teach all us Zetland savages new ways? Take\r\nyour own gate, my lad, if that is the song you sing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay,\" said Mordaunt; \"I had only some curiosity to see the new\r\nimplements he has brought.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, ferlies make fools fain. I would like to know if his new plough\r\nwill bear against a Zetland rock?\" answered Magnus.\r\n\r\n\"I must not pass Stourburgh on the journey,\" said the youth, deferring\r\nto his patron's prejudice against innovation, \"if this boding weather\r\nbring on tempest; but if it only break in rain, as is most probable, I\r\nam not likely to be melted in the wetting.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will not soften into rain alone,\" said Minna; \"see how much heavier\r\nthe clouds fall every moment, and see these weather-gaws that streak the\r\nlead-coloured mass with partial gleams of faded red and purple.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see them all,\" said Mordaunt; \"but they only tell me I have no time\r\nto tarry here. Adieu, Minna; I will send you the eagle's feathers, if an\r\neagle can be found on Fair-isle or Foulah. And fare thee well, my pretty\r\nBrenda, and keep a thought for me, should the Paba men dance ever so\r\nwell.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take care of yourself, since go you will,\" said both sisters, together.\r\n\r\nOld Magnus scolded them formally for supposing there was any danger to\r\nan active young fellow from a spring gale, whether by sea or land; yet\r\nended by giving his own caution also to Mordaunt, advising him seriously\r\nto delay his journey, or at least to stop at Stourburgh. \"For,\" said he,\r\n\"second thoughts are best; and as this Scottishman's howf lies right\r\nunder your lee, why, take any port in a storm. But do not be assured to\r\nfind the door on latch, let the storm blow ever so hard; there are such\r\nmatters as bolts and bars in Scotland,(_e_) though, thanks to Saint\r\nRonald, they are unknown here, save that great lock on the old Castle\r\nof Scalloway, that all men run to see--may be they make part of this\r\nman's improvements. But go, Mordaunt, since go you will. You should\r\ndrink a stirrup-cup now, were you three years older, but boys should\r\nnever drink, excepting after dinner; I will drink it for you, that good\r\ncustoms may not be broken, or bad luck come of it. Here is your bonally,\r\nmy lad.\" And so saying, he quaffed a rummer glass of brandy with as much\r\nimpunity as if it had been spring-water. Thus regretted and cautioned on\r\nall hands, Mordaunt took leave of the hospitable household, and looking\r\nback at the comforts with which it was surrounded, and the dense smoke\r\nthat rolled upwards from its chimneys, he first recollected the\r\nguestless and solitary desolation of Jarlshof, then compared with the\r\nsullen and moody melancholy of his father's temper the warm kindness of\r\nthose whom he was leaving, and could not refrain from a sigh at the\r\nthoughts which forced themselves on his imagination.\r\n\r\nThe signs of the tempest did not dishonour the predictions of Minna.\r\nMordaunt had not advanced three hours on his journey, before the wind,\r\nwhich had been so deadly still in the morning, began at first to wail\r\nand sigh, as if bemoaning beforehand the evils which it might perpetrate\r\nin its fury, like a madman in the gloomy state of dejection which\r\nprecedes his fit of violence; then gradually increasing, the gale\r\nhowled, raged, and roared, with the full fury of a northern storm. It\r\nwas accompanied by showers of rain mixed with hail, that dashed with the\r\nmost unrelenting rage against the hills and rocks with which the\r\ntraveller was surrounded, distracting his attention, in spite of his\r\nutmost exertions, and rendering it very difficult for him to keep the\r\ndirection of his journey in a country where there is neither road, nor\r\neven the slightest track to direct the steps of the wanderer, and where\r\nhe is often interrupted by brooks as well as large pools of water,\r\nlakes, and lagoons. All these inland waters were now lashed into sheets\r\nof tumbling foam, much of which, carried off by the fury of the\r\nwhirlwind, was mingled with the gale, and transported far from the waves\r\nof which it had lately made a part; while the salt relish of the drift\r\nwhich was pelted against his face, showed Mordaunt that the spray of the\r\nmore distant ocean, disturbed to frenzy by the storm, was mingled with\r\nthat of the inland lakes and streams.\r\n\r\nAmidst this hideous combustion of the elements, Mordaunt Mertoun\r\nstruggled forward as one to whom such elemental war was familiar, and\r\nwho regarded the exertions which it required to withstand its fury, but\r\nas a mark of resolution and manhood. He felt even, as happens usually to\r\nthose who endure great hardships, that the exertion necessary to subdue\r\nthem, is in itself a kind of elevating triumph. To see and distinguish\r\nhis path when the cattle were driven from the hill, and the very fowls\r\nfrom the firmament, was but the stronger proof of his own superiority.\r\n\"They shall not hear of me at Burgh-Westra,\" said he to himself, \"as\r\nthey heard of old doited Ringan Ewenson's boat, that foundered betwixt\r\nroadstead and key. I am more of a cragsman than to mind fire or water,\r\nwave by sea, or quagmire by land.\" Thus he struggled on, buffeting with\r\nthe storm, supplying the want of the usual signs by which travellers\r\ndirected their progress, (for rock, mountain, and headland, were\r\nshrouded in mist and darkness,) by the instinctive sagacity with which\r\nlong acquaintance with these wilds had taught him to mark every minute\r\nobject, which could serve in such circumstances to regulate his course.\r\nThus, we repeat, he struggled onward, occasionally standing still, or\r\neven lying down, when the gust was most impetuous; making way against it\r\nwhen it was somewhat lulled, by a rapid and bold advance even in its\r\nvery current; or, when this was impossible, by a movement resembling\r\nthat of a vessel working to windward by short tacks, but never yielding\r\none inch of the way which he had fought so hard to gain.\r\n\r\nYet, notwithstanding Mordaunt's experience and resolution, his situation\r\nwas sufficiently uncomfortable, and even precarious; not because his\r\nsailor's jacket and trowsers, the common dress of young men through\r\nthese isles when on a journey, were thoroughly wet, for that might have\r\ntaken place within the same brief time, in any ordinary day, in this\r\nwatery climate; but the real danger was, that, notwithstanding his\r\nutmost exertions, he made very slow way through brooks that were sending\r\ntheir waters all abroad, through morasses drowned in double deluges of\r\nmoisture, which rendered all the ordinary passes more than usually\r\ndangerous, and repeatedly obliged the traveller to perform a\r\nconsiderable circuit, which in the usual case was unnecessary. Thus\r\nrepeatedly baffled, notwithstanding his youth and strength, Mordaunt,\r\nafter maintaining a dogged conflict with wind, rain, and the fatigue of\r\na prolonged journey, was truly happy, when, not without having been more\r\nthan once mistaken in his road, he at length found himself within sight\r\nof the house of Stourburgh, or Harfra; for the names were indifferently\r\ngiven to the residence of Mr. Triptolemus Yellowley, who was the chosen\r\nmissionary of the Chamberlain of Orkney and Zetland, a speculative\r\nperson, who designed, through the medium of Triptolemus, to introduce\r\ninto the _Ultima Thule_ of the Romans, a spirit of improvement, which at\r\nthat early period was scarce known to exist in Scotland itself.\r\n\r\nAt length, and with much difficulty, Mordaunt reached the house of this\r\nworthy agriculturist, the only refuge from the relentless storm which he\r\ncould hope to meet with for several miles; and going straight to the\r\ndoor, with the most undoubting confidence of instant admission, he was\r\nnot a little surprised to find it not merely latched, which the weather\r\nmight excuse, but even bolted, a thing which, as Magnus Troil has\r\nalready intimated, was almost unknown in the Archipelago. To knock, to\r\ncall, and finally to batter the door with staff and stones, were the\r\nnatural resources of the youth, who was rendered alike impatient by the\r\npelting of the storm, and by encountering such most unexpected and\r\nunusual obstacles to instant admission. As he was suffered, however, for\r\nmany minutes to exhaust his impatience in noise and clamour, without\r\nreceiving any reply, we will employ them in informing the reader who\r\nTriptolemus Yellowley was, and how he came by a name so singular.\r\n\r\nOld Jasper Yellowley, the father of Triptolemus, (though born at the\r\nfoot of Roseberry-Topping,) had been _come over_ by a certain noble\r\nScottish Earl, who, proving too far north for canny Yorkshire, had\r\npersuaded him to accept of a farm in the Mearns, where, it is\r\nunnecessary to add, he found matters very different from what he had\r\nexpected. It was in vain that the stout farmer set manfully to work, to\r\ncounterbalance, by superior skill, the inconveniences arising from a\r\ncold soil and a weeping climate. These might have been probably\r\novercome; but his neighbourhood to the Grampians exposed him eternally\r\nto that species of visitation from the plaided gentry, who dwelt within\r\ntheir skirts, which made young Norval a warrior and a hero, but only\r\nconverted Jasper Yellowley into a poor man. This was, indeed, balanced\r\nin some sort by the impression which his ruddy cheek and robust form had\r\nthe fortune to make upon Miss Barbara Clinkscale, daughter to the\r\numquhile, and sister to the then existing, Clinkscale of that ilk.\r\n\r\nThis was thought a horrid and unnatural union in the neighbourhood,\r\nconsidering that the house of Clinkscale had at least as great a share\r\nof Scottish pride as of Scottish parsimony, and was amply endowed with\r\nboth. But Miss Babie had her handsome fortune of two thousand marks at\r\nher own disposal, was a woman of spirit who had been _major_ and _sui\r\njuris_, (as the writer who drew the contract assured her,) for full\r\ntwenty years; so she set consequences and commentaries alike at\r\ndefiance, and wedded the hearty Yorkshire yeoman. Her brother and her\r\nmore wealthy kinsmen drew off in disgust, and almost disowned their\r\ndegraded relative. But the house of Clinkscale was allied (like every\r\nother family in Scotland at the time) to a set of relations who were not\r\nso nice--tenth and sixteenth cousins, who not only acknowledged their\r\nkinswoman Babie after her marriage with Yellowley but even condescended\r\nto eat beans and bacon (though the latter was then the abomination of\r\nthe Scotch as much as of the Jews) with her husband, and would\r\nwillingly have cemented the friendship by borrowing a little cash from\r\nhim, had not his good lady (who understood trap as well as any woman in\r\nthe Mearns) put a negative on this advance to intimacy. Indeed she knew\r\nhow to make young Deilbelicket,(_f_) old Dougald Baresword, the Laird of\r\nBandybrawl, and others, pay for the hospitality which she did not think\r\nproper to deny them, by rendering them useful in her negotiations with\r\nthe lighthanded lads beyond the Cairn, who, finding their late object of\r\nplunder was now allied to \"kend folks, and owned by them at kirk and\r\nmarket,\" became satisfied, on a moderate yearly composition, to desist\r\nfrom their depredations.\r\n\r\nThis eminent success reconciled Jasper to the dominion which his wife\r\nbegan to assume over him; and which was much confirmed by her proving to\r\nbe--let me see--what is the prettiest mode of expressing it?--in the\r\nfamily way. On this occasion, Mrs. Yellowley had a remarkable dream, as\r\nis the usual practice of teeming mothers previous to the birth of an\r\nillustrious offspring. She \"was a-dreamed,\" as her husband expressed it,\r\nthat she was safely delivered of a plough, drawn by three yoke of\r\nAngus-shire oxen; and being a mighty investigator into such portents,\r\nshe sat herself down with her gossips, to consider what the thing might\r\nmean. Honest Jasper ventured, with much hesitation, to intimate his own\r\nopinion, that the vision had reference rather to things past than things\r\nfuture, and might have been occasioned by his wife's nerves having been\r\na little startled by meeting in the loan above the house his own great\r\nplough with the six oxen, which were the pride of his heart. But the\r\ngood _cummers_[20] raised such a hue and cry against this exposition,\r\nthat Jasper was fain to put his fingers in his ears, and to run out of\r\nthe apartment.\r\n\r\n\"Hear to him,\" said an old whigamore carline--\"hear to him, wi' his\r\nowsen, that are as an idol to him, even as the calf of Bethel! Na,\r\nna--it's nae pleugh of the flesh that the bonny lad-bairn--for a lad it\r\nsall be--sall e'er striddle between the stilts o'--it's the pleugh of\r\nthe spirit--and I trust mysell to see him wag the head o' him in a\r\npu'pit; or, what's better, on a hill-side.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now the deil's in your whiggery,\" said the old Lady Glenprosing; \"wad\r\nye hae our cummer's bonny lad-bairn wag the head aff his shouthers like\r\nyour godly Mess James Guthrie,(_g_) that ye hald such a clavering\r\nabout?--Na, na, he sall walk a mair siccar path, and be a dainty\r\ncurate--and say he should live to be a bishop, what the waur wad he be?\"\r\n\r\nThe gauntlet thus fairly flung down by one sibyl, was caught up by\r\nanother, and the controversy between presbytery and episcopacy raged,\r\nroared, or rather screamed, a round of cinnamon-water serving only like\r\noil to the flame, till Jasper entered with the plough-staff; and by the\r\nawe of his presence, and the shame of misbehaving \"before the stranger\r\nman,\" imposed some conditions of silence upon the disputants.\r\n\r\nI do not know whether it was impatience to give to the light a being\r\ndestined to such high and doubtful fates, or whether poor Dame Yellowley\r\nwas rather frightened at the hurly-burly which had taken place in her\r\npresence, but she was taken suddenly ill; and, contrary to the formula\r\nin such cases used and provided, was soon reported to be \"a good deal\r\nworse than was to be expected.\" She took the opportunity (having still\r\nall her wits about her) to extract from her sympathetic husband two\r\npromises; first, that he would christen the child, whose birth was like\r\nto cost her so dear, by a name indicative of the vision with which she\r\nhad been favoured; and next, that he would educate him for the ministry.\r\nThe canny Yorkshireman, thinking she had a good title at present to\r\ndictate in such matters, subscribed to all she required. A man-child was\r\naccordingly born under these conditions, but the state of the mother did\r\nnot permit her for many days to enquire how far they had been complied\r\nwith. When she was in some degree convalescent, she was informed, that\r\nas it was thought fit the child should be immediately christened, it had\r\nreceived the name of Triptolemus; the Curate, who was a man of some\r\nclassical skill, conceiving that this epithet contained a handsome and\r\nclassical allusion to the visionary plough, with its triple yoke of\r\noxen. Mrs. Yellowley was not much delighted with the manner in which her\r\nrequest had been complied with; but grumbling being to as little purpose\r\nas in the celebrated case of Tristram Shandy, she e'en sat down\r\ncontented with the heathenish name, and endeavoured to counteract the\r\neffects it might produce upon the taste and feelings of the nominee, by\r\nsuch an education as might put him above the slightest thought of sacks,\r\ncoulters, stilts, mould-boards, or any thing connected with the servile\r\ndrudgery of the plough.\r\n\r\nJasper, sage Yorkshireman, smiled slyly in his sleeve, conceiving that\r\nyoung Trippie was likely to prove a chip of the old block, and would\r\nrather take after the jolly Yorkshire yeoman, than the gentle but\r\nsomewhat _aigre_ blood of the house of Clinkscale. He remarked, with\r\nsuppressed glee, that the tune which best answered the purpose of a\r\nlullaby was the \"Ploughman's Whistle,\" and the first words the infant\r\nlearned to stammer were the names of the oxen; moreover, that the \"bern\"\r\npreferred home-brewed ale to Scotch twopenny, and never quitted hold of\r\nthe tankard with so much reluctance as when there had been, by some\r\nmanoeuvre of Jasper's own device, a double straik of malt allowed to the\r\nbrewing, above that which was sanctioned by the most liberal recipe, of\r\nwhich his dame's household thrift admitted. Besides this, when no other\r\nmeans could be fallen upon to divert an occasional fit of squalling, his\r\nfather observed that Trip could be always silenced by jingling a bridle\r\nat his ear. From all which symptoms he used to swear in private, that\r\nthe boy would prove true Yorkshire, and mother and mother's kin would\r\nhave small share of him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, and within a year after the birth of Triptolemus, Mrs.\r\nYellowley bore a daughter, named after herself Barbara, who, even in\r\nearliest infancy, exhibited the pinched nose and thin lips by which the\r\nClinkscale family were distinguished amongst the inhabitants of the\r\nMearns; and as her childhood advanced, the readiness with which she\r\nseized, and the tenacity wherewith she detained, the playthings of\r\nTriptolemus, besides a desire to bite, pinch, and scratch, on slight, or\r\nno provocation, were all considered by attentive observers as proofs,\r\nthat Miss Babie would prove \"her mother over again.\" Malicious people\r\ndid not stick to say, that the acrimony of the Clinkscale blood had not,\r\non this occasion, been cooled and sweetened by that of Old England;\r\nthat young Deilbelicket was much about the house, and they could not but\r\nthink it odd that Mrs. Yellowley, who, as the whole world knew, gave\r\nnothing for nothing, should be so uncommonly attentive to heap the\r\ntrencher, and to fill the caup, of an idle blackguard ne'er-do-weel. But\r\nwhen folk had once looked upon the austere and awfully virtuous\r\ncountenance of Mrs. Yellowley, they did full justice to her propriety of\r\nconduct, and Deilbelicket's delicacy of taste.\r\n\r\nMeantime young Triptolemus, having received such instructions as the\r\nCurate could give him, (for though Dame Yellowley adhered to the\r\npersecuted remnant, her jolly husband, edified by the black gown and\r\nprayer-book, still conformed to the church as by law established,) was,\r\nin due process of time, sent to Saint Andrews to prosecute his studies.\r\nHe went, it is true; but with an eye turned back with sad remembrances\r\non his father's plough, his father's pancakes, and his father's ale, for\r\nwhich the small-beer of the college, commonly there termed\r\n\"thorough-go-nimble,\" furnished a poor substitute. Yet he advanced in\r\nhis learning, being found, however, to show a particular favour to such\r\nauthors of antiquity as had made the improvement of the soil the object\r\nof their researches. He endured the Bucolics of Virgil--the Georgics he\r\nhad by heart--but the Æneid he could not away with; and he was\r\nparticularly severe upon the celebrated line expressing a charge of\r\ncavalry, because, as he understood the word _putrem_,[21] he opined that\r\nthe combatants, in their inconsiderate ardour, galloped over a\r\nnew-manured ploughed field. Cato, the Roman Censor was his favourite\r\namong classical heroes and philosophers, not on account of the\r\nstrictness of his morals, but because of his treatise, _de Re Rustica_.\r\nHe had ever in his mouth the phrase of Cicero, _Jam neminem antepones\r\nCatoni_. He thought well of Palladius, and of Terentius Varro, but\r\nColumella was his pocket-companion. To these ancient worthies, he added\r\nthe more modern Tusser, Hartlib, and other writers on rural economics,\r\nnot forgetting the lucubrations of the Shepherd of Salisbury Plain, and\r\nsuch of the better-informed Philomaths, who, instead of loading their\r\nalmanacks with vain predictions of political events, pretended to see\r\nwhat seeds would grow and what would not, and direct the attention of\r\ntheir readers to that course of cultivation from which the production of\r\ngood crops may be safely predicted; modest sages, in fine, who, careless\r\nof the rise and downfall of empires, content themselves with pointing\r\nout the fit seasons to reap and sow, with a fair guess at the weather\r\nwhich each month will be likely to present; as, for example, that if\r\nHeaven pleases, we shall have snow in January, and the author will stake\r\nhis reputation that July proves, on the whole, a month of sunshine. Now,\r\nalthough the Rector of Saint Leonard's was greatly pleased, in general,\r\nwith the quiet, laborious, and studious bent of Triptolemus Yellowley,\r\nand deemed him, in so far, worthy of a name of four syllables having a\r\nLatin termination, yet he relished not, by any means, his exclusive\r\nattention to his favourite authors. It savoured of the earth, he said,\r\nif not of something worse, to have a man's mind always grovelling in\r\nmould, stercorated or unstercorated; and he pointed out, but in vain,\r\nhistory, and poetry, and divinity, as more elevating subjects of\r\noccupation. Triptolemus Yellowley was obstinate in his own course: Of\r\nthe battle of Pharsalia, he thought not as it affected the freedom of\r\nthe world, but dwelt on the rich crop which the Emathian fields were\r\nlikely to produce the next season. In vernacular poetry, Triptolemus\r\ncould scarce be prevailed upon to read a single couplet, excepting old\r\nTusser, as aforesaid, whose Hundred Points of Good Husbandry he had got\r\nby heart; and excepting also Piers Ploughman's Vision, which, charmed\r\nwith the title, he bought with avidity from a packman, but after reading\r\nthe two first pages, flung it into the fire as an impudent and misnamed\r\npolitical libel. As to divinity, he summed that matter up by reminding\r\nhis instructors, that to labour the earth and win his bread with the\r\ntoil of his body and sweat of his brow, was the lot imposed upon fallen\r\nman; and, for his part, he was resolved to discharge, to the best of his\r\nabilities, a task so obviously necessary to existence, leaving others to\r\nspeculate as much as they would, upon the more recondite mysteries of\r\ntheology.\r\n\r\nWith a spirit so much narrowed and limited to the concerns of rural\r\nlife, it may be doubted whether the proficiency of Triptolemus in\r\nlearning, or the use he was like to make of his acquisitions, would have\r\nmuch gratified the ambitious hope of his affectionate mother. It is\r\ntrue, he expressed no reluctance to embrace the profession of a\r\nclergyman, which suited well enough with the habitual personal indolence\r\nwhich sometimes attaches to speculative dispositions. He had views, to\r\nspeak plainly, (I wish they were peculiar to himself,) of cultivating\r\nthe _glebe_ six days in the week, preaching on the seventh with due\r\nregularity, and dining with some fat franklin or country laird, with\r\nwhom he could smoke a pipe and drink a tankard after dinner, and mix in\r\nsecret conference on the exhaustless subject,\r\n\r\n  Quid faciat lætas segetes.\r\n\r\nNow, this plan, besides that it indicated nothing of what was then\r\ncalled the root of the matter, implied necessarily the possession of a\r\nmanse; and the possession of a manse inferred compliance with the\r\ndoctrines of prelacy, and other enormities of the time. There was some\r\nquestion how far manse and glebe, stipend, both victual and money, might\r\nhave outbalanced the good lady's predisposition towards Presbytery; but\r\nher zeal was not put to so severe a trial. She died before her son had\r\ncompleted his studies, leaving her afflicted spouse just as disconsolate\r\nas was to be expected. The first act of old Jasper's undivided\r\nadministration was to recall his son from Saint Andrews, in order to\r\nobtain his assistance in his domestic labours. And here it might have\r\nbeen supposed that our Triptolemus, summoned to carry into practice what\r\nhe had so fondly studied in theory, must have been, to use a simile\r\nwhich _he_ would have thought lively, like a cow entering upon a clover\r\npark. Alas, mistaken thoughts, and deceitful hopes of mankind!\r\n\r\nA laughing philosopher, the Democritus of our day, once, in a moral\r\nlecture, compared human life to a table pierced with a number of holes,\r\neach of which has a pin made exactly to fit it, but which pins being\r\nstuck in hastily, and without selection, chance leads inevitably to the\r\nmost awkward mistakes. \"For how often do we see,\" the orator\r\npathetically concluded,--\"how often, I say, do we see the round man\r\nstuck into the three-cornered hole!\" This new illustration of the\r\nvagaries of fortune set every one present into convulsions of laughter,\r\nexcepting one fat alderman, who seemed to make the case his own, and\r\ninsisted that it was no jesting matter. To take up the simile, however,\r\nwhich is an excellent one, it is plain that Triptolemus Yellowley had\r\nbeen shaken out of the bag at least a hundred years too soon. If he had\r\ncome on the stage in our own time, that is, if he had flourished at any\r\ntime within these thirty or forty years, he could not have missed to\r\nhave held the office of vice-president of some eminent agricultural\r\nsociety, and to have transacted all the business thereof under the\r\nauspices of some noble duke or lord, who, as the matter might happen,\r\neither knew, or did not know, the difference betwixt a horse and a cart,\r\nand a cart-horse. He could not have missed such preferment, for he was\r\nexceedingly learned in all those particulars, which, being of no\r\nconsequence in actual practice, go, of course, a great way to constitute\r\nthe character of a connoisseur in any art, and especially in\r\nagriculture. But, alas! Triptolemus Yellowley had, as we already have\r\nhinted, come into the world at least a century too soon; for, instead of\r\nsitting in an arm-chair, with a hammer in his hand, and a bumper of port\r\nbefore him, giving forth the toast,--\"To breeding, in all its branches,\"\r\nhis father planted him betwixt the stilts of a plough, and invited him\r\nto guide the oxen, on whose beauties he would, in our day, have\r\ndescanted, and whose rumps he would not have goaded, but have carved.\r\nOld Jasper complained, that although no one talked so well of common and\r\nseveral, wheat and rape, fallow and lea, as his learned son, (whom he\r\nalways called Tolimus,) yet, \"dang it,\" added the Seneca, \"nought\r\nthrives wi' un--nought thrives wi' un!\" It was still worse, when Jasper,\r\nbecoming frail and ancient, was obliged, as happened in the course of a\r\nfew years, gradually to yield up the reins of government to the\r\nacademical neophyte.\r\n\r\nAs if Nature had meant him a spite, he had got one of the _dourest_ and\r\nmost intractable farms in the Mearns, to try conclusions withal, a place\r\nwhich seemed to yield every thing but what the agriculturist wanted; for\r\nthere were plenty of thistles, which indicates dry land; and store of\r\nfern, which is said to intimate deep land; and nettles, which show where\r\nlime hath been applied; and deep furrows in the most unlikely spots,\r\nwhich intimated that it had been cultivated in former days by the\r\nPeghts, as popular tradition bore. There was also enough of stones to\r\nkeep the ground warm, according to the creed of some farmers, and great\r\nabundance of springs to render it cool and sappy, according to the\r\ntheory of others. It was in vain that, acting alternately on these\r\nopinions, poor Triptolemus endeavoured to avail himself of the supposed\r\ncapabilities of the soil. No kind of butter that might be churned could\r\nbe made to stick upon his own bread, any more than on that of poor\r\nTusser, whose Hundred Points of Good Husbandry, so useful to others of\r\nhis day, were never to himself worth as many pennies.[22]\r\n\r\nIn fact, excepting an hundred acres of infield, to which old Jasper had\r\nearly seen the necessity of limiting his labours, there was not a\r\ncorner of the farm fit for any thing but to break plough-graith, and\r\nkill cattle. And then, as for the part which was really tilled with some\r\nprofit, the expense of the farming establishment of Triptolemus, and his\r\ndisposition to experiment, soon got rid of any good arising from the\r\ncultivation of it. \"The carles and the cart-avers,\" he confessed, with a\r\nsigh, speaking of his farm-servants and horses, \"make it all, and the\r\ncarles and cart-avers eat it all;\" a conclusion which might sum up the\r\nyear-book of many a gentleman farmer.\r\n\r\nMatters would have soon been brought to a close with Triptolemus in the\r\npresent day. He would have got a bank-credit, manoeuvred with\r\nwind-bills, dashed out upon a large scale, and soon have seen his crop\r\nand stock sequestered by the Sheriff; but in those days a man could not\r\nruin himself so easily. The whole Scottish tenantry stood upon the same\r\nlevel flat of poverty, so that it was extremely difficult to find any\r\nvantage ground, by climbing up to which a man might have an opportunity\r\nof actually breaking his neck with some eclat. They were pretty much in\r\nthe situation of people, who, being totally without credit, may indeed\r\nsuffer from indigence, but cannot possibly become bankrupt. Besides,\r\nnotwithstanding the failure of Triptolemus's projects, there was to be\r\nbalanced against the expenditure which they occasioned, all the savings\r\nwhich the extreme economy of his sister Barbara could effect; and in\r\ntruth her exertions were wonderful. She might have realized, if any one\r\ncould, the idea of the learned philosopher, who pronounced that sleeping\r\nwas a fancy, and eating but a habit, and who appeared to the world to\r\nhave renounced both, until it was unhappily discovered that he had an\r\nintrigue with the cook-maid of the family, who indemnified him for his\r\nprivations by giving him private entrée to the pantry, and to a share of\r\nher own couch. But no such deceptions were practised by Barbara\r\nYellowley. She was up early, and down late, and seemed, to her\r\nover-watched and over-tasked maidens, to be as _wakerife_ as the cat\r\nherself. Then, for eating, it appeared that the air was a banquet to\r\nher, and she would fain have made it so to her retinue. Her brother,\r\nwho, besides being lazy in his person, was somewhat luxurious in his\r\nappetite, would willingly now and then have tasted a mouthful of animal\r\nfood, were it but to know how his sheep were fed off; but a proposal to\r\neat a child could not have startled Mistress Barbara more; and, being of\r\na compliant and easy disposition, Triptolemus reconciled himself to the\r\nnecessity of a perpetual Lent, too happy when he could get a scrap of\r\nbutter to his oaten cake, or (as they lived on the banks of the Esk)\r\nescape the daily necessity of eating salmon, whether in or out of\r\nseason, six days out of the seven.\r\n\r\nBut although Mrs. Barbara brought faithfully to the joint stock all\r\nsavings which her awful powers of economy accomplished to scrape\r\ntogether, and although the dower of their mother was by degrees\r\nexpended, or nearly so, in aiding them upon extreme occasions, the term\r\nat length approached when it seemed impossible that they could sustain\r\nthe conflict any longer against the evil star of Triptolemus, as he\r\ncalled it himself, or the natural result of his absurd speculations, as\r\nit was termed by others. Luckily at this sad crisis, a god jumped down\r\nto their relief out of a machine. In plain English, the noble lord, who\r\nowned their farm, arrived at his mansion-house in their neighbourhood,\r\nwith his coach and six and his running footmen, in the full splendour\r\nof the seventeenth century.\r\n\r\nThis person of quality was the son of the nobleman who had brought the\r\nancient Jasper into the country from Yorkshire, and he was, like his\r\nfather, a fanciful and scheming man.[23] He had schemed well for\r\nhimself, however, amid the mutations of the time, having obtained, for a\r\ncertain period of years, the administration of the remote islands of\r\nOrkney and Zetland, for payment of a certain rent, with the right of\r\nmaking the most of whatever was the property or revenue of the crown in\r\nthese districts, under the title of Lord Chamberlain. Now, his lordship\r\nhad become possessed with a notion, in itself a very true one, that much\r\nmight be done to render this grant available, by improving the culture\r\nof the crown lands, both in Orkney and Zetland; and then having some\r\nacquaintance with our friend Triptolemus, he thought (rather less\r\nhappily) that he might prove a person capable of furthering his schemes.\r\nHe sent for him to the great Hallhouse, and was so much edified by the\r\nway in which our friend laid down the law upon every given subject\r\nrelating to rural economy, that he lost no time in securing the\r\nco-operation of so valuable an assistant, the first step being to\r\nrelease him from his present unprofitable farm.\r\n\r\nThe terms were arranged much to the mind of Triptolemus, who had already\r\nbeen taught, by many years' experience, a dark sort of notion, that\r\nwithout undervaluing or doubting for a moment his own skill, it would be\r\nquite as well that almost all the trouble and risk should be at the\r\nexpense of his employer. Indeed, the hopes of advantage which he held\r\nout to his patron were so considerable, that the Lord Chamberlain\r\ndropped every idea of admitting his dependent into any share of the\r\nexpected profits; for, rude as the arts of agriculture were in Scotland,\r\nthey were far superior to those known and practised in the regions of\r\nThule, and Triptolemus Yellowley conceived himself to be possessed of a\r\ndegree of insight into these mysteries, far superior to what was\r\npossessed or practised even in the Mearns. The improvement, therefore,\r\nwhich was to be expected, would bear a double proportion, and the Lord\r\nChamberlain was to reap all the profit, deducting a handsome salary for\r\nhis steward Yellowley, together with the accommodation of a house and\r\ndomestic farm, for the support of his family. Joy seized the heart of\r\nMistress Barbara, at hearing this happy termination of what threatened\r\nto be so very bad an affair as the lease of Cauldacres.\r\n\r\n\"If we cannot,\" she said, \"provide for our own house, when all is coming\r\nin, and nothing going out, surely we must be worse than infidels!\"\r\n\r\nTriptolemus was a busy man for some time, huffing and puffing, and\r\neating and drinking in every changehouse, while he ordered and collected\r\ntogether proper implements of agriculture, to be used by the natives of\r\nthese devoted islands, whose destinies were menaced with this formidable\r\nchange. Singular tools these would seem, if presented before a modern\r\nagricultural society; but every thing is relative, nor could the heavy\r\ncartload of timber, called the old Scots plough, seem less strange to a\r\nScottish farmer of this present day, than the corslets and casques of\r\nthe soldiers of Cortes might seem to a regiment of our own army. Yet the\r\nlatter conquered Mexico, and undoubtedly the former would have been a\r\nsplendid improvement on the state of agriculture in Thule.\r\n\r\nWe have never been able to learn why Triptolemus preferred fixing his\r\nresidence in Zetland, to becoming an inhabitant of the Orkneys. Perhaps\r\nhe thought the inhabitants of the latter Archipelago the more simple and\r\ndocile of the two kindred tribes; or perhaps he considered the situation\r\nof the house and farm he himself was to occupy, (which was indeed a\r\ntolerable one,) as preferable to that which he had it in his power to\r\nhave obtained upon Pomona (so the main island of the Orkneys is\r\nentitled). At Harfra, or, as it was sometimes called, Stourburgh, from\r\nthe remains of a Pictish fort, which was almost close to the\r\nmansion-house, the factor settled himself, in the plenitude of his\r\nauthority; determined to honour the name he bore by his exertions, in\r\nprecept and example, to civilize the Zetlanders, and improve their very\r\nconfined knowledge in the primary arts of human life.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] The cormorant; which may be seen frequently dashing in wild flight\r\nalong the roosts and tides of Zetland, and yet more often drawn up in\r\nranks on some ledge of rock, like a body of the Black Brunswickers in\r\n181.\r\n\r\n[20] _i. e._ Gossips.\r\n\r\n[21] Quadrupedumque putrem sonitu quatit ungula campum.\r\n\r\n[22] This is admitted by the English agriculturist:--\r\n\r\n  \"My music since has been the plough,\r\n    Entangled with some care among;\r\n  The gain not great, the pain enough,\r\n    Hath made me sing another song.\"\r\n\r\n[23] GOVERNMENT OF ZETLAND.--At the period supposed, the Earls of Morton\r\nheld the islands of Orkney and Zetland, originally granted in 1643,\r\nconfirmed in 1707, and rendered absolute in 1742. This gave the family\r\nmuch property and influence, which they usually exercised by factors,\r\nnamed chamberlains. In 1766 this property was sold by the then Earl of\r\nMorton to Sir Lawrence Dundas, by whose son, Lord Dundas, it is now\r\nheld.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n  The wind blew keen frae north and east;\r\n    It blew upon the floor.\r\n  Quo' our goodman to our goodwife,\r\n    \"Get up and bar the door.\"\r\n\r\n  \"My hand is in my housewife-skep,\r\n    Goodman, as ye may see;\r\n  If it shouldna be barr'd this hundred years,\r\n    It's no be barr'd for me!\"\r\n\r\n                                                 _Old Song._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe can only hope that the gentle reader has not found the latter part of\r\nthe last chapter extremely tedious; but, at any rate, his impatience\r\nwill scarce equal that of young Mordaunt Mertoun, who, while the\r\nlightning came flash after flash, while the wind, veering and shifting\r\nfrom point to point, blew with all the fury of a hurricane, and while\r\nthe rain was dashed against him in deluges, stood hammering, calling,\r\nand roaring at the door of the old Place of Harfra, impatient for\r\nadmittance, and at a loss to conceive any position of existing\r\ncircumstances, which could occasion the exclusion of a stranger,\r\nespecially during such horrible weather. At length, finding his noise\r\nand vociferation were equally in vain, he fell back so far from the\r\nfront of the house, as was necessary to enable him to reconnoitre the\r\nchimneys; and amidst \"storm and shade,\" could discover, to the increase\r\nof his dismay, that though noon, then the dinner hour of these islands,\r\nwas now nearly arrived, there was no smoke proceeding from the tunnels\r\nof the vents to give any note of preparation within.\r\n\r\nMordaunt's wrathful impatience was now changed into sympathy and alarm;\r\nfor, so long accustomed to the exuberant hospitality of the Zetland\r\nislands, he was immediately induced to suppose some strange and\r\nunaccountable disaster had befallen the family; and forthwith set\r\nhimself to discover some place at which he could make forcible entry, in\r\norder to ascertain the situation of the inmates, as much as to obtain\r\nshelter from the still increasing storm. His present anxiety was,\r\nhowever, as much thrown away as his late clamorous importunities for\r\nadmittance had been. Triptolemus and his sister had heard the whole\r\nalarm without, and had already had a sharp dispute on the propriety of\r\nopening the door.\r\n\r\nMrs. Baby, as we have described her, was no willing renderer of the\r\nrites of hospitality. In their farm of Cauldacres, in the Mearns, she\r\nhad been the dread and abhorrence of all gaberlunzie men, and travelling\r\npackmen, gipsies, long remembered beggars, and so forth; nor was there\r\none of them so wily, as she used to boast, as could ever say they had\r\nheard the clink of her sneck. In Zetland, where the new settlers were\r\nyet strangers to the extreme honesty and simplicity of all classes,\r\nsuspicion and fear joined with frugality in her desire to exclude all\r\nwandering guests of uncertain character; and the second of these motives\r\nhad its effect on Triptolemus himself, who, though neither suspicious\r\nnor penurious, knew good people were scarce, good farmers scarcer, and\r\nhad a reasonable share of that wisdom which looks towards\r\nself-preservation as the first law of nature. These hints may serve as\r\na commentary on the following dialogue which took place betwixt the\r\nbrother and sister.\r\n\r\n\"Now, good be gracious to us,\" said Triptolemus, as he sat thumbing his\r\nold school-copy of Virgil, \"here is a pure day, for the bear seed!--Well\r\nspoke the wise Mantuan--_ventis surgentibus_--and then the groans of the\r\nmountains, and the long-resounding shores--but where's the woods, Baby?\r\ntell me, I say, where we shall find the _nemorum murmur_, sister Baby,\r\nin these new seats of ours?\"\r\n\r\n\"What's your foolish will?\" said Baby, popping her head from out of a\r\ndark recess in the kitchen, where she was busy about some nameless deed\r\nof housewifery.\r\n\r\nHer brother, who had addressed himself to her more from habit than\r\nintention, no sooner saw her bleak red nose, keen grey eyes, with the\r\nsharp features thereunto conforming, shaded by the flaps of the loose\r\n_toy_ which depended on each side of her eager face, than he bethought\r\nhimself that his query was likely to find little acceptation from her,\r\nand therefore stood another volley before he would resume the topic.\r\n\r\n\"I say, Mr. Yellowley,\" said sister Baby, coming into the middle of the\r\nroom, \"what for are ye crying on me, and me in the midst of my\r\nhousewifeskep?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, for nothing at all, Baby,\" answered Triptolemus, \"saving that I\r\nwas saying to myself, that here we had the sea, and the wind, and the\r\nrain, sufficient enough, but where's the wood? where's the wood, Baby,\r\nanswer me that?\"\r\n\r\n\"The wood?\" replied Baby--\"Were I no to take better care of the wood\r\nthan you, brother, there would soon be no more wood about the town than\r\nthe barber's block that's on your own shoulders, Triptolemus. If ye be\r\nthinking of the wreck-wood that the callants brought in yesterday, there\r\nwas six ounces of it gaed to boil your parritch this morning; though, I\r\ntrow, a carefu' man wad have ta'en drammock, if breakfast he behoved to\r\nhave, rather than waste baith meltith and fuel in the same morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is to say, Baby,\" replied Triptolemus, who was somewhat of a dry\r\njoker in his way, \"that when we have fire we are not to have food, and\r\nwhen we have food we are not to have fire, these being too great\r\nblessings to enjoy both in the same day! Good luck, you do not propose\r\nwe should starve with cold and starve with hunger _unico contextu_. But,\r\nto tell you the truth, I could never away with raw oatmeal, slockened\r\nwith water, in all my life. Call it drammock, or crowdie, or just what\r\nye list, my vivers must thole fire and water.\"\r\n\r\n\"The mair gowk you,\" said Baby; \"can ye not make your brose on the\r\nSunday, and sup them cauld on the Monday, since ye're sae dainty? Mony\r\nis the fairer face than yours that has licked the lip after such a\r\ncogfu'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mercy on us, sister!\" said Triptolemus; \"at this rate, it's a finished\r\nfield with me--I must unyoke the pleugh, and lie down to wait for the\r\ndead-thraw. Here is that in this house wad hold all Zetland in meal for\r\na twelvemonth, and ye grudge a cogfu' of warm parritch to me, that has\r\nsic a charge!\"\r\n\r\n\"Whisht--haud your silly clavering tongue!\" said Baby, looking round\r\nwith apprehension--\"ye are a wise man to speak of what is in the house,\r\nand a fitting man to have the charge of it!--Hark, as I live by bread,\r\nI hear a tapping at the outer yett!\"\r\n\r\n\"Go and open it then, Baby,\" said her brother, glad at any thing that\r\npromised to interrupt the dispute.\r\n\r\n\"Go and open it, said he!\" echoed Baby, half angry, half frightened, and\r\nhalf triumphant at the superiority of her understanding over that of her\r\nbrother--\"Go and open it, said he, indeed!--is it to lend robbers a\r\nchance to take all that is in the house?\"\r\n\r\n\"Robbers!\" echoed Triptolemus, in his turn; \"there are no more robbers\r\nin this country than there are lambs at Yule. I tell you, as I have told\r\nyou an hundred times, there are no Highlandmen to harry us here. This is\r\na land of quiet and honesty. _O fortunati nimium!_\"\r\n\r\n\"And what good is Saint Rinian to do ye, Tolimus?\" said his sister,\r\nmistaking the quotation for a Catholic invocation. \"Besides, if there be\r\nno Highlandmen, there may be as bad. I saw sax or seven as ill-looking\r\nchields gang past the Place yesterday, as ever came frae beyont\r\nClochna-ben; ill-fa'red tools they had in their hands, whaaling knives\r\nthey ca'ed them, but they looked as like dirks and whingers as ae bit\r\nairn can look like anither. There is nae honest men carry siccan tools.\"\r\n\r\nHere the knocking and shouts of Mordaunt were very audible betwixt every\r\nswell of the horrible blast which was careering without. The brother and\r\nsister looked at each other in real perplexity and fear. \"If they have\r\nheard of the siller,\" said Baby, her very nose changing with terror from\r\nred to blue, \"we are but gane folk!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who speaks now, when they should hold their tongue?\" said Triptolemus.\r\n\"Go to the shot-window instantly, and see how many there are of them,\r\nwhile I load the old Spanish-barrelled duck-gun--go as if you were\r\nstepping on new-laid eggs.\"\r\n\r\nBaby crept to the window, and reported that she saw only \"one young\r\nchield, clattering and roaring as gin he were daft. How many there might\r\nbe out of sight, she could not say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Out of sight!--nonsense,\" said Triptolemus, laying aside the ramrod\r\nwith which he was loading the piece, with a trembling hand. \"I will\r\nwarrant them out of sight and hearing both--this is some poor fellow\r\ncatched in the tempest, wants the shelter of our roof, and a little\r\nrefreshment. Open the door, Baby, it's a Christian deed.\"\r\n\r\n\"But is it a Christian deed of him to come in at the window, then?\" said\r\nBaby, setting up a most doleful shriek, as Mordaunt Mertoun, who had\r\nforced open one of the windows, leaped down into the apartment, dripping\r\nwith water like a river god. Triptolemus, in great tribulation,\r\npresented the gun which he had not yet loaded, while the intruder\r\nexclaimed, \"Hold, hold--what the devil mean you by keeping your doors\r\nbolted in weather like this, and levelling your gun at folk's heads as\r\nyou would at a sealgh's?\"\r\n\r\n\"And who are you, friend, and what want you?\" said Triptolemus, lowering\r\nthe but of his gun to the floor as he spoke, and so recovering his arms.\r\n\r\n\"What do I want!\" said Mordaunt; \"I want every thing--I want meat,\r\ndrink, and fire, a bed for the night, and a sheltie for to-morrow\r\nmorning to carry me to Jarlshof.\"\r\n\r\n\"And ye said there were nae caterans or sorners here?\" said Baby to the\r\nagriculturist, reproachfully. \"Heard ye ever a breekless loon frae\r\nLochaber tell his mind and his errand mair deftly?--Come, come, friend,\"\r\nshe added, addressing herself to Mordaunt, \"put up your pipes and gang\r\nyour gate; this is the house of his lordship's factor, and no place of\r\nreset for thiggers or sorners.\"\r\n\r\nMordaunt laughed in her face at the simplicity of the request. \"Leave\r\nbuilt walls,\" he said, \"and in such a tempest as this? What take you me\r\nfor?--a gannet or a scart do you think I am, that your clapping your\r\nhands and skirling at me like a madwoman, should drive me from the\r\nshelter into the storm?\"\r\n\r\n\"And so you propose, young man,\" said Triptolemus, gravely, \"to stay in\r\nmy house, _volens nolens_--that is, whether we will or no?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will!\" said Mordaunt; \"what right have you to will any thing about it?\r\nDo you not hear the thunder? Do you not hear the rain? Do you not see\r\nthe lightning? And do you not know this is the only house within I wot\r\nnot how many miles? Come, my good master and dame, this may be Scottish\r\njesting, but it sounds strange in Zetland ears. You have let out the\r\nfire, too, and my teeth are dancing a jig in my head with cold; but I'll\r\nsoon put that to rights.\"\r\n\r\nHe seized the fire-tongs, raked together the embers upon the hearth,\r\nbroke up into life the gathering-peat, which the hostess had calculated\r\nshould have preserved the seeds of fire, without giving them forth, for\r\nmany hours; then casting his eye round, saw in a corner the stock of\r\ndrift-wood, which Mistress Baby had served forth by ounces, and\r\ntransferred two or three logs of it at once to the hearth, which,\r\nconscious of such unwonted supply, began to transmit to the chimney\r\nsuch a smoke as had not issued from the Place of Harfra for many a day.\r\n\r\nWhile their uninvited guest was thus making himself at home, Baby kept\r\nedging and jogging the factor to turn out the intruder. But for this\r\nundertaking, Triptolemus Yellowley felt neither courage nor zeal, nor\r\ndid circumstances seem at all to warrant the favourable conclusion of\r\nany fray into which he might enter with the young stranger. The sinewy\r\nlimbs and graceful form of Mordaunt Mertoun were seen to great advantage\r\nin his simple sea-dress; and with his dark sparkling eye, finely formed\r\nhead, animated features, close curled dark hair, and bold, free looks,\r\nthe stranger formed a very strong contrast with the host on whom he had\r\nintruded himself. Triptolemus was a short, clumsy, duck-legged disciple\r\nof Ceres, whose bottle-nose, turned up and handsomely coppered at the\r\nextremity, seemed to intimate something of an occasional treaty with\r\nBacchus. It was like to be no equal mellay betwixt persons of such\r\nunequal form and strength; and the difference betwixt twenty and fifty\r\nyears was nothing in favour of the weaker party. Besides, the factor was\r\nan honest good-natured fellow at bottom, and being soon satisfied that\r\nhis guest had no other views than those of obtaining refuge from the\r\nstorm, it would, despite his sister's instigations, have been his last\r\nact to deny a boon so reasonable and necessary to a youth whose exterior\r\nwas so prepossessing. He stood, therefore, considering how he could most\r\ngracefully glide into the character of the hospitable landlord, out of\r\nthat of the churlish defender of his domestic castle, against an\r\nunauthorized intrusion, when Baby, who had stood appalled at the extreme\r\nfamiliarity of the stranger's address and demeanour, now spoke up for\r\nherself.\r\n\r\n\"My troth, lad,\" said she to Mordaunt, \"ye are no blate, to light on at\r\nthat rate, and the best of wood, too--nane of your sharney peats, but\r\ngood aik timber, nae less maun serve ye!\"\r\n\r\n\"You come lightly by it, dame,\" said Mordaunt, carelessly; \"and you\r\nshould not grudge to the fire what the sea gives you for nothing. These\r\ngood ribs of oak did their last duty upon earth and ocean, when they\r\ncould hold no longer together under the brave hearts that manned the\r\nbark.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that's true, too,\" said the old woman, softening--\"this maun be\r\nawsome weather by sea. Sit down and warm ye, since the sticks are\r\na-low.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay,\" said Triptolemus, \"it is a pleasure to see siccan a bonny\r\nbleeze. I havena seen the like o't since I left Cauldacres.\"\r\n\r\n\"And shallna see the like o't again in a hurry,\" said Baby, \"unless the\r\nhouse take fire, or there suld be a coal-heugh found out.\"\r\n\r\n\"And wherefore should not there be a coal-heugh found out?\" said the\r\nfactor, triumphantly--\"I say, wherefore should not a coal-heugh be found\r\nout in Zetland as well as in Fife, now that the Chamberlain has a\r\nfar-sighted and discreet man upon the spot to make the necessary\r\nperquisitions? They are baith fishing-stations, I trow?\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you what it is, Tolemus Yellowley,\" answered his sister, who had\r\npractical reasons to fear her brother's opening upon any false scent,\r\n\"if you promise my Lord sae mony of these bonnie-wallies, we'll no be\r\nweel hafted here before we are found out and set a-trotting again. If\r\nane was to speak to ye about a gold mine, I ken weel wha would promise\r\nhe suld have Portugal pieces clinking in his pouch before the year gaed\r\nby.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why suld I not?\" said Triptolemus--\"maybe your head does not know\r\nthere is a land in Orkney called Ophir, or something very like it; and\r\nwherefore might not Solomon, the wise King of the Jews, have sent\r\nthither his ships and his servants for four hundred and fifty talents? I\r\ntrow he knew best where to go or send, and I hope you believe in your\r\nBible, Baby?\"\r\n\r\nBaby was silenced by an appeal to Scripture, however _mal à propos_, and\r\nonly answered by an inarticulate _humph_ of incredulity or scorn, while\r\nher brother went on addressing Mordaunt.--\"Yes, you shall all of you see\r\nwhat a change shall coin introduce, even into such an unpropitious\r\ncountry as yours. Ye have not heard of copper, I warrant, nor of\r\niron-stone, in these islands, neither?\" Mordaunt said he had heard there\r\nwas copper near the Cliffs of Konigsburgh. \"Ay, and a copper scum is\r\nfound on the Loch of Swana, too, young man. But the youngest of you,\r\ndoubtless, thinks himself a match for such as I am!\"\r\n\r\nBaby, who during all this while had been closely and accurately\r\nreconnoitring the youth's person, now interposed in a manner by her\r\nbrother totally unexpected. \"Ye had mair need, Mr. Yellowley, to give\r\nthe young man some dry clothes, and to see about getting something for\r\nhim to eat, than to sit there bleezing away with your lang tales, as if\r\nthe weather were not windy enow without your help; and maybe the lad\r\nwould drink some _bland_, or sic-like, if ye had the grace to ask him.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Triptolemus looked astonished at such a proposal, considering the\r\nquarter it came from, Mordaunt answered, he \"should be very glad to\r\nhave dry clothes, but begged to be excused from drinking until he had\r\neaten somewhat.\"\r\n\r\nTriptolemus accordingly conducted him into another apartment, and\r\naccommodating him with a change of dress, left him to his arrangements,\r\nwhile he himself returned to the kitchen, much puzzled to account for\r\nhis sister's unusual fit of hospitality. \"She must be _fey_,\"[24] he\r\nsaid, \"and in that case has not long to live, and though I fall heir to\r\nher tocher-good, I am sorry for it; for she has held the house-gear well\r\ntogether--drawn the girth over tight it may be now and then, but the\r\nsaddle sits the better.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Triptolemus returned to the kitchen, he found his suspicions\r\nconfirmed; for his sister was in the desperate act of consigning to the\r\npot a smoked goose, which, with others of the same tribe, had long hung\r\nin the large chimney, muttering to herself at the same time,--\"It maun\r\nbe eaten sune or syne, and what for no by the puir callant?\"\r\n\r\n\"What is this of it, sister?\" said Triptolemus. \"You have on the girdle\r\nand the pot at ance. What day is this wi' you?\"\r\n\r\n\"E'en such a day as the Israelites had beside the flesh-pots of Egypt,\r\nbillie Triptolemus; but ye little ken wha ye have in your house this\r\nblessed day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Troth, and little do I ken,\" said Triptolemus, \"as little as I would\r\nken the naig I never saw before. I would take the lad for a jagger,[25]\r\nbut he has rather ower good havings, and he has no pack.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye ken as little as ane of your ain bits o' nowt, man,\" retorted sister\r\nBaby; \"if ye ken na him, do ye ken Tronda Dronsdaughter?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tronda Dronsdaughter!\" echoed Triptolemus--\"how should I but ken her,\r\nwhen I pay her twal pennies Scots by the day, for working in the house\r\nhere? I trow she works as if the things burned her fingers. I had better\r\ngive a Scots lass a groat of English siller.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that's the maist sensible word ye have said this blessed\r\nmorning.--Weel, but Tronda kens this lad weel, and she has often spoke\r\nto me about him. They call his father the Silent Man of Sumburgh, and\r\nthey say he's uncanny.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hout, hout--nonsense, nonsense--they are aye at sic trash as that,\"\r\nsaid the brother, \"when you want a day's wark out of them--they have\r\nstepped ower the tangs, or they have met an uncanny body, or they have\r\nturned about the boat against the sun, and then there's nought to be\r\ndone that day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Weel, weel, brother, ye are so wise,\" said Baby, \"because ye knapped\r\nLatin at Saint Andrews; and can your lair tell me, then, what the lad\r\nhas round his halse?\"\r\n\r\n\"A Barcelona napkin, as wet as a dishclout, and I have just lent him one\r\nof my own overlays,\" said Triptolemus.\r\n\r\n\"A Barcelona napkin!\" said Baby, elevating her voice, and then suddenly\r\nlowering it, as from apprehension of being overheard--\"I say a gold\r\nchain!\"\r\n\r\n\"A gold chain!\" said Triptolemus.\r\n\r\n\"In troth is it, hinny; and how like you that? The folk say here, as\r\nTronda tells me, that the King of the Drows gave it to his father, the\r\nSilent Man of Sumburgh.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish you would speak sense, or be the silent woman,\" said\r\nTriptolemus. \"The upshot of it all is, then, that this lad is the rich\r\nstranger's son, and that you are giving him the goose you were to keep\r\ntill Michaelmas!\"\r\n\r\n\"Troth, brother, we maun do something for God's sake, and to make\r\nfriends; and the lad,\" added Baby, (for even she was not altogether\r\nabove the prejudices of her sex in favour of outward form,) \"the lad has\r\na fair face of his ain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye would have let mony a fair face,\" said Triptolemus, \"pass the door\r\npining, if it had not been for the gold chain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nae doubt, nae doubt,\" replied Barbara; \"ye wadna have me waste our\r\nsubstance on every thigger or sorner that has the luck to come by the\r\ndoor in a wet day? But this lad has a fair and a wide name in the\r\ncountry, and Tronda says he is to be married to a daughter of the rich\r\nUdaller, Magnus Troil, and the marriage-day is to be fixed whenever he\r\nmakes choice (set him up) between the twa lasses; and so it wad be as\r\nmuch as our good name is worth, and our quiet forby, to let him sit\r\nunserved, although he does come unsent for.\"\r\n\r\n\"The best reason in life,\" said Triptolemus, \"for letting a man into a\r\nhouse is, that you dare not bid him go by. However, since there is a man\r\nof quality amongst them, I will let him know whom he has to do with, in\r\nmy person.\" Then advancing to the door, he exclaimed, \"_Heus tibi,\r\nDave!_\"\r\n\r\n\"_Adsum_,\" answered the youth, entering the apartment.\r\n\r\n\"Hem!\" said the erudite Triptolemus, \"not altogether deficient in his\r\nhumanities, I see. I will try him further.--Canst thou aught of\r\nhusbandry, young gentleman?\"\r\n\r\n\"Troth, sir, not I,\" answered Mordaunt; \"I have been trained to plough\r\nupon the sea, and to reap upon the crag.\"\r\n\r\n\"Plough the sea!\" said Triptolemus; \"that's a furrow requires small\r\nharrowing; and for your harvest on the crag, I suppose you mean these\r\n_scowries_, or whatever you call them. It is a sort of ingathering which\r\nthe Ranzelman should stop by the law; nothing more likely to break an\r\nhonest man's bones. I profess I cannot see the pleasure men propose by\r\ndangling in a rope's-end betwixt earth and heaven. In my case, I had as\r\nlief the other end of the rope were fastened to the gibbet; I should be\r\nsure of not falling, at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, I would only advise you to try it,\" replied Mordaunt. \"Trust me,\r\nthe world has few grander sensations than when one is perched in midair\r\nbetween a high-browed cliff and a roaring ocean, the rope by which you\r\nare sustained seeming scarce stronger than a silken thread, and the\r\nstone on which you have one foot steadied, affording such a breadth as\r\nthe kittywake might rest upon--to feel and know all this, with the full\r\nconfidence that your own agility of limb, and strength of head, can\r\nbring you as safe off as if you had the wing of the gosshawk--this is\r\nindeed being almost independent of the earth you tread on!\"\r\n\r\nTriptolemus stared at this enthusiastic description of an amusement\r\nwhich had so few charms for him; and his sister, looking at the glancing\r\neye and elevated bearing of the young adventurer, answered, by\r\nejaculating, \"My certie, lad, but ye are a brave chield!\"\r\n\r\n\"A brave chield?\" returned Yellowley,--\"I say a brave goose, to be\r\nflichtering and fleeing in the wind when he might abide upon _terra\r\nfirma_! But come, here's a goose that is more to the purpose, when once\r\nit is well boiled. Get us trenchers and salt, Baby--but in truth it will\r\nprove salt enough--a tasty morsel it is; but I think the Zetlanders be\r\nthe only folk in the world that think of running such risks to catch\r\ngeese, and then boiling them when they have done.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure,\" replied his sister, (it was the only word they had agreed\r\nin that day,) \"it would be an unco thing to bid ony gudewife in Angus or\r\na' the Mearns boil a goose, while there was sic things as spits in the\r\nwarld.--But wha's this neist!\" she added, looking towards the entrance\r\nwith great indignation. \"My certie, open doors, and dogs come in--and\r\nwha opened the door to him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did, to be sure,\" replied Mordaunt; \"you would not have a poor devil\r\nstand beating your deaf door-cheeks in weather like this?--Here goes\r\nsomething, though, to help the fire,\" he added, drawing out the sliding\r\nbar of oak with which the door had been secured, and throwing it on the\r\nhearth, whence it was snatched by Dame Baby in great wrath, she\r\nexclaiming at the same time,--\r\n\r\n\"It's sea-borne timber, as there's little else here, and he dings it\r\nabout as if it were a fir-clog!--And who be you, an it please you?\" she\r\nadded, turning to the stranger,--\"a very hallanshaker loon, as ever\r\ncrossed my twa een!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a jagger, if it like your ladyship,\" replied the uninvited guest,\r\na stout vulgar, little man, who had indeed the humble appearance of a\r\npedlar, called _jagger_ in these islands--\"never travelled in a waur\r\nday, or was more willing to get to harbourage.--Heaven be praised for\r\nfire and house-room!\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he drew a stool to the fire, and sat down without further\r\nceremony. Dame Baby stared \"wild as grey gosshawk,\" and was meditating\r\nhow to express her indignation in something warmer than words, for which\r\nthe boiling pot seemed to offer a convenient hint, when an old\r\nhalf-starved serving-woman--the Tronda already mentioned--the sharer of\r\nBarbara's domestic cares, who had been as yet in some remote corner of\r\nthe mansion, now hobbled into the room, and broke out into exclamations\r\nwhich indicated some new cause of alarm.\r\n\r\n\"O master!\" and \"O mistress!\" were the only sounds she could for some\r\ntime articulate, and then followed them up with, \"The best in the\r\nhouse--the best in the house--set a' on the board, and a' will be little\r\naneugh--There is auld Norna of Fitful-head, the most fearful woman in\r\nall the isles!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where can she have been wandering?\" said Mordaunt, not without some\r\napparent sympathy with the surprise, if not with the alarm, of the old\r\ndomestic; \"but it is needless to ask--the worse the weather, the more\r\nlikely is she to be a traveller.\"\r\n\r\n\"What new tramper is this?\" echoed the distracted Baby, whom the quick\r\nsuccession of guests had driven wellnigh crazy with vexation. \"I'll soon\r\nsettle her wandering, I sall warrant, if my brother has but the saul of\r\na man in him, or if there be a pair of jougs at Scalloway!\"\r\n\r\n\"The iron was never forged on stithy that would hauld her,\" said the old\r\nmaid-servant. \"She comes--she comes--God's sake speak her fair and\r\ncanny, or we will have a ravelled hasp on the yarn-windles!\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, a woman, tall enough almost to touch the top of the door\r\nwith her cap, stepped into the room, signing the cross as she entered,\r\nand pronouncing, with a solemn voice, \"The blessing of God and Saint\r\nRonald on the open door, and their broad malison and mine upon\r\nclose-handed churls!\"\r\n\r\n\"And wha are ye, that are sae bauld wi' your blessing and banning in\r\nother folk's houses? What kind of country is this, that folk cannot sit\r\nquiet for an hour, and serve Heaven, and keep their bit gear thegither,\r\nwithout gangrel men and women coming thigging and sorning ane after\r\nanother, like a string of wild-geese?\"\r\n\r\nThis speech, the understanding reader will easily saddle on Mistress\r\nBaby, and what effects it might have produced on the last stranger, can\r\nonly be matter of conjecture; for the old servant and Mordaunt applied\r\nthemselves at once to the party addressed, in order to deprecate her\r\nresentment; the former speaking to her some words of Norse, in a tone of\r\nintercession, and Mordaunt saying in English, \"They are strangers,\r\nNorna, and know not your name or qualities; they are unacquainted, too,\r\nwith the ways of this country, and therefore we must hold them excused\r\nfor their lack of hospitality.\"\r\n\r\n\"I lack no hospitality, young man,\" said Triptolemus, \"_miseris\r\nsuccurrere disco_--the goose that was destined to roost in the chimney\r\ntill Michaelmas, is boiling in the pot for you; but if we had twenty\r\ngeese, I see we are like to find mouths to eat them every feather--this\r\nmust be amended.\"\r\n\r\n\"What must be amended, sordid slave?\" said the stranger Norna, turning\r\nat once upon him with an emphasis that made him start--\"_What_ must be\r\namended? Bring hither, if thou wilt, thy new-fangled coulters, spades,\r\nand harrows, alter the implements of our fathers from the ploughshare to\r\nthe mouse-trap; but know thou art in the land that was won of old by the\r\nflaxen-haired Kempions of the North, and leave us their hospitality at\r\nleast, to show we come of what was once noble and generous. I say to you\r\nbeware--while Norna looks forth at the measureless waters, from the\r\ncrest of Fitful-head, something is yet left that resembles power of\r\ndefence. If the men of Thule have ceased to be champions, and to spread\r\nthe banquet for the raven, the women have not forgotten the arts that\r\nlifted them of yore into queens and prophetesses.\"\r\n\r\nThe woman who pronounced this singular tirade, was as striking in\r\nappearance as extravagantly lofty in her pretensions and in her\r\nlanguage. She might well have represented on the stage, so far as\r\nfeatures, voice, and stature, were concerned, the Bonduca or Boadicea of\r\nthe Britons, or the sage Velleda, Aurinia, or any other fated Pythoness,\r\nwho ever led to battle a tribe of the ancient Goths. Her features were\r\nhigh and well formed, and would have been handsome, but for the ravages\r\nof time and the effects of exposure to the severe weather of her\r\ncountry. Age, and perhaps sorrow, had quenched, in some degree, the fire\r\nof a dark-blue eye, whose hue almost approached to black, and had\r\nsprinkled snow on such parts of her tresses as had escaped from under\r\nher cap, and were dishevelled by the rigour of the storm. Her upper\r\ngarment, which dropped with water, was of a coarse dark-coloured stuff,\r\ncalled wadmaal, then much used in the Zetland islands, as also in\r\nIceland and Norway. But as she threw this cloak back from her\r\nshoulders, a short jacket, of dark-blue velvet, stamped with figures,\r\nbecame visible, and the vest, which corresponded to it, was of crimson\r\ncolour, and embroidered with tarnished silver. Her girdle was plated\r\nwith silver ornaments, cut into the shape of planetary signs--her blue\r\napron was embroidered with similar devices, and covered a petticoat of\r\ncrimson cloth. Strong thick enduring shoes, of the half-dressed leather\r\nof the country, were tied with straps like those of the Roman buskins,\r\nover her scarlet stockings. She wore in her belt an ambiguous-looking\r\nweapon, which might pass for a sacrificing knife, or dagger, as the\r\nimagination of the spectator chose to assign to the wearer the character\r\nof a priestess or of a sorceress. In her hand she held a staff, squared\r\non all sides, and engraved with Runic characters and figures, forming\r\none of those portable and perpetual calendars which were used among the\r\nancient natives of Scandinavia, and which, to a superstitious eye, might\r\nhave passed for a divining rod.\r\n\r\nSuch were the appearance, features, and attire, of Norna of the\r\nFitful-head, upon whom many of the inhabitants of the island looked with\r\nobservance, many with fear, and almost all with a sort of veneration.\r\nLess pregnant circumstances of suspicion would, in any other part of\r\nScotland, have exposed her to the investigation of those cruel\r\ninquisitors, who were then often invested with the delegated authority\r\nof the Privy Council, for the purpose of persecuting, torturing, and\r\nfinally consigning to the flames, those who were accused of witchcraft\r\nor sorcery. But superstitions of this nature pass through two stages ere\r\nthey become entirely obsolete. Those supposed to be possessed of\r\nsupernatural powers, are venerated in the earlier stages of society. As\r\nreligion and knowledge increase, they are first held in hatred and\r\nhorror, and are finally regarded as impostors. Scotland was in the\r\nsecond state--the fear of witchcraft was great, and the hatred against\r\nthose suspected of it intense. Zetland was as yet a little world by\r\nitself, where, among the lower and ruder classes, so much of the ancient\r\nnorthern superstition remained, as cherished the original veneration for\r\nthose affecting supernatural knowledge, and power over the elements,\r\nwhich made a constituent part of the ancient Scandinavian creed. At\r\nleast if the natives of Thule admitted that one class of magicians\r\nperformed their feats by their alliance with Satan, they devoutly\r\nbelieved that others dealt with spirits of a different and less odious\r\nclass--the ancient Dwarfs, called, in Zetland, Trows, or Drows, the\r\nmodern fairies, and so forth.\r\n\r\nAmong those who were supposed to be in league with disembodied spirits,\r\nthis Norna, descended from, and representative of, a family, which had\r\nlong pretended to such gifts, was so eminent, that the name assigned to\r\nher, which signifies one of those fatal sisters who weave the web of\r\nhuman fate, had been conferred in honour of her supernatural powers. The\r\nname by which she had been actually christened was carefully concealed\r\nby herself and her parents; for to its discovery they superstitiously\r\nannexed some fatal consequences. In those times, the doubt only\r\noccurred, whether her supposed powers were acquired by lawful means. In\r\nour days, it would have been questioned whether she was an impostor, or\r\nwhether her imagination was so deeply impressed with the mysteries of\r\nher supposed art, that she might be in some degree a believer in her\r\nown pretensions to supernatural knowledge. Certain it is, that she\r\nperformed her part with such undoubting confidence, and such striking\r\ndignity of look and action, and evinced, at the same time, such strength\r\nof language, and energy of purpose, that it would have been difficult\r\nfor the greatest sceptic to have doubted the reality of her enthusiasm,\r\nthough he might smile at the pretensions to which it gave rise.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[24] When a person changes his condition suddenly, as when a miser\r\nbecomes liberal, or a churl good-humoured, he is said, in Scotch, to be\r\n_fey_; that is, predestined to speedy death, of which such mutations of\r\nhumour are received as a sure indication.\r\n\r\n[25] A pedlar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n      ----If, by your art, you have\r\n  Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.\r\n\r\n                                                  _Tempest._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe storm had somewhat relaxed its rigour just before the entrance of\r\nNorna, otherwise she must have found it impossible to travel during the\r\nextremity of its fury. But she had hardly added herself so unexpectedly\r\nto the party whom chance had assembled at the dwelling of Triptolemus\r\nYellowley, when the tempest suddenly resumed its former vehemence, and\r\nraged around the building with a fury which made the inmates insensible\r\nto any thing except the risk that the old mansion was about to fall\r\nabove their heads.\r\n\r\nMistress Baby gave vent to her fears in loud exclamations of \"The Lord\r\nguide us--this is surely the last day--what kind of a country of\r\nguisards and gyre-carlines is this!--and you, ye fool carle,\" she added,\r\nturning on her brother, (for all her passions had a touch of acidity in\r\nthem,) \"to quit the bonny Mearns land to come here, where there is\r\nnaething but sturdy beggars and gaberlunzies within ane's house, and\r\nHeaven's anger on the outside on't!\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you, sister Baby,\" answered the insulted agriculturist, \"that\r\nall shall be reformed and amended,--excepting,\" he added, betwixt his\r\nteeth, \"the scaulding humours of an ill-natured jaud, that can add\r\nbitterness to the very storm!\"\r\n\r\nThe old domestic and the pedlar meanwhile exhausted themselves in\r\nentreaties to Norna, of which, as they were couched in the Norse\r\nlanguage, the master of the house understood nothing.\r\n\r\nShe listened to them with a haughty and unmoved air, and replied at\r\nlength aloud, and in English--\"I will not. What if this house be strewed\r\nin ruins before morning--where would be the world's want in the crazed\r\nprojector, and the niggardly pinch-commons, by which it is inhabited?\r\nThey will needs come to reform Zetland customs, let them try how they\r\nlike a Zetland storm.--You that would not perish, quit this house!\"\r\n\r\nThe pedlar seized on his little knapsack, and began hastily to brace it\r\non his back; the old maid-servant cast her cloak about her shoulders,\r\nand both seemed to be in the act of leaving the house as fast as they\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nTriptolemus Yellowley, somewhat commoved by these appearances, asked\r\nMordaunt, with a voice which faltered with apprehension, whether he\r\nthought there was any, that is, so very much danger?\r\n\r\n\"I cannot tell,\" answered the youth, \"I have scarce ever seen such a\r\nstorm. Norna can tell us better than any one when it will abate; for no\r\none in these islands can judge of the weather like her.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is that all thou thinkest Norna can do?\" said the sibyl; \"thou\r\nshalt know her powers are not bounded within such a narrow space. Hear\r\nme, Mordaunt, youth of a foreign land, but of a friendly heart--Dost\r\nthou quit this doomed mansion with those who now prepare to leave it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not--I will not, Norna,\" replied Mordaunt; \"I know not your motive\r\nfor desiring me to remove, and I will not leave, upon these dark\r\nthreats, the house in which I have been kindly received in such a\r\ntempest as this. If the owners are unaccustomed to our practice of\r\nunlimited hospitality, I am the more obliged to them that they have\r\nrelaxed their usages, and opened their doors in my behalf.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is a brave lad,\" said Mistress Baby, whose superstitious feelings\r\nhad been daunted by the threats of the supposed sorceress, and who,\r\namidst her eager, narrow, and repining disposition, had, like all who\r\npossess marked character, some sparks of higher feeling, which made her\r\nsympathize with generous sentiments, though she thought it too expensive\r\nto entertain them at her own cost--\"He is a brave lad,\" she again\r\nrepeated, \"and worthy of ten geese, if I had them to boil for him, or\r\nroast either. I'll warrant him a gentleman's son, and no churl's blood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear me, young Mordaunt,\" said Norna, \"and depart from this house. Fate\r\nhas high views on you--you shall not remain in this hovel to be crushed\r\namid its worthless ruins, with the relics of its more worthless\r\ninhabitants, whose life is as little to the world as the vegetation of\r\nthe house-leek, which now grows on their thatch, and which shall soon be\r\ncrushed amongst their mangled limbs.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I--I will go forth,\" said Yellowley, who, despite of his bearing\r\nhimself scholarly and wisely, was beginning to be terrified for the\r\nissue of the adventure; for the house was old, and the walls rocked\r\nformidably to the blast.\r\n\r\n\"To what purpose?\" said his sister. \"I trust the Prince of the power of\r\nthe air has not yet such-like power over those that are made in God's\r\nimage, that a good house should fall about our heads, because a randy\r\nquean\" (here she darted a fierce glance at the Pythoness) \"should boast\r\nus with her glamour, as if we were sae mony dogs to crouch at her\r\nbidding!\"\r\n\r\n\"I was only wanting,\" said Triptolemus, ashamed of his motion, \"to look\r\nat the bear-braird, which must be sair laid wi' this tempest; but if\r\nthis honest woman like to bide wi' us, I think it were best to let us a'\r\nsit doun canny thegither, till it's working weather again.\"\r\n\r\n\"Honest woman!\" echoed Baby--\"Foul warlock thief!--Aroint ye, ye\r\nlimmer!\" she added, addressing Norna directly; \"out of an honest house,\r\nor, shame fa' me, but I'll take the bittle[26] to you!\"\r\n\r\nNorna cast on her a look of supreme contempt; then, stepping to the\r\nwindow, seemed engaged in deep contemplation of the heavens, while the\r\nold maid-servant, Tronda, drawing close to her mistress, implored, for\r\nthe sake of all that was dear to man or woman, \"Do not provoke Norna of\r\nFitful-head! You have no sic woman on the mainland of Scotland--she can\r\nride on one of these clouds as easily as man ever rode on a sheltie.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall live to see her ride on the reek of a fat tar-barrel,\" said\r\nMistress Baby; \"and that will be a fit pacing palfrey for her.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Norna regarded the enraged Mrs. Baby Yellowley with a look of that\r\nunutterable scorn which her haughty features could so well express, and\r\nmoving to the window which looked to the north-west, from which quarter\r\nthe gale seemed at present to blow, she stood for some time with her\r\narms crossed, looking out upon the leaden-coloured sky, obscured as it\r\nwas by the thick drift, which, coming on in successive gusts of tempest,\r\nleft ever and anon sad and dreary intervals of expectation betwixt the\r\ndying and the reviving blast.\r\n\r\nNorna regarded this war of the elements as one to whom their strife was\r\nfamiliar; yet the stern serenity of her features had in it a cast of\r\nawe, and at the same time of authority, as the cabalist may be supposed\r\nto look upon the spirit he has evoked, and which, though he knows how to\r\nsubject him to his spell, bears still an aspect appalling to flesh and\r\nblood. The attendants stood by in different attitudes, expressive of\r\ntheir various feelings. Mordaunt, though not indifferent to the risk in\r\nwhich they stood, was more curious than alarmed. He had heard of Norna's\r\nalleged power over the elements, and now expected an opportunity of\r\njudging for himself of its reality. Triptolemus Yellowley was confounded\r\nat what seemed to be far beyond the bounds of his philosophy; and, if\r\nthe truth must be spoken, the worthy agriculturist was greatly more\r\nfrightened than inquisitive. His sister was not in the least curious on\r\nthe subject; but it was difficult to say whether anger or fear\r\npredominated in her sharp eyes and thin compressed lips. The pedlar and\r\nold Tronda, confident that the house would never fall while the\r\nredoubted Norna was beneath its roof, held themselves ready for a start\r\nthe instant she should take her departure.\r\n\r\nHaving looked on the sky for some time in a fixed attitude, and with the\r\nmost profound silence, Norna at once, yet with a slow and elevated\r\ngesture, extended her staff of black oak towards that part of the\r\nheavens from which the blast came hardest, and in the midst of its fury\r\nchanted a Norwegian invocation, still preserved in the Island of Uist,\r\nunder the name of the Song of the Reimkennar, though some call it the\r\nSong of the Tempest. The following is a free translation, it being\r\nimpossible to render literally many of the elliptical and metaphorical\r\nterms of expression, peculiar to the ancient Northern poetry:--\r\n\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n  \"Stern eagle of the far north-west,\r\n  Thou that bearest in thy grasp the thunderbolt,\r\n  Thou whose rushing pinions stir ocean to madness,\r\n  Thou the destroyer of herds, thou the scatterer of navies,\r\n  Thou the breaker down of towers,\r\n  Amidst the scream of thy rage,\r\n  Amidst the rushing of thy onward wings,\r\n  Though thy scream be loud as the cry of a perishing nation,\r\n  Though the rushing of thy wings be like the roar of ten thousand waves,\r\n  Yet hear, in thine ire and thy haste,\r\n  Hear thou the voice of the Reim-kennar.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n  \"Thou hast met the pine-trees of Drontheim,\r\n  Their dark-green heads lie prostrate beside their uprooted stems;\r\n  Thou hast met the rider of the ocean,\r\n  The tall, the strong bark of the fearless rover,\r\n  And she has struck to thee the topsail\r\n  That she had not veiled to a royal armada;\r\n  Thou hast met the tower that hears its crest among the clouds,\r\n  The battled massive tower of the Jarl of former days,\r\n  And the cope-stone of the turret\r\n  Is lying upon its hospitable hearth;\r\n  But thou too shalt stoop, proud compeller of clouds,\r\n  When thou hearest the voice of the Reim-kennar.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\n  \"There are verses that can stop the stag in the forest,\r\n  Ay, and when the dark-coloured dog is opening on his track;\r\n  There are verses can make the wild hawk pause on the wing,\r\n  Like the falcon that wears the hood and the jesses,\r\n  And who knows the shrill whistle of the fowler.\r\n  Thou who canst mock at the scream of the drowning mariner,\r\n  And the crash of the ravaged forest,\r\n  And the groan of the overwhelmed crowds,\r\n  When the church hath fallen in the moment of prayer,\r\n  There are sounds which thou also must list,\r\n  When they are chanted by the voice of the Reim-kennar.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.\r\n\r\n  \"Enough of woe hast thou wrought on the ocean,\r\n  The widows wring their hands on the beach;\r\n  Enough of woe hast thou wrought on the land,\r\n  The husbandman folds his arms in despair;\r\n  Cease thou the waving of thy pinions,\r\n  Let the ocean repose in her dark strength;\r\n  Cease thou the flashing of thine eye.\r\n  Let the thunderbolt sleep in the armoury of Odin;\r\n  Be thou still at my bidding, viewless racer of the north-western heaven,\r\n  Sleep thou at the voice of Norna the Reim-kennar!\"\r\n\r\nWe have said that Mordaunt was naturally fond of romantic poetry and\r\nromantic situation; it is not therefore surprising that he listened with\r\ninterest to the wild address thus uttered to the wildest wind of the\r\ncompass, in a tone of such dauntless enthusiasm. But though he had heard\r\nso much of the Runic rhyme and of the northern spell, in the country\r\nwhere he had so long dwelt, he was not on this occasion so credulous as\r\nto believe that the tempest, which had raged so lately, and which was\r\nnow beginning to decline, was subdued before the charmed verse of Norna.\r\nCertain it was, that the blast seemed passing away, and the apprehended\r\ndanger was already over; but it was not improbable that this issue had\r\nbeen for some time foreseen by the Pythoness, through signs of the\r\nweather imperceptible to those who had not dwelt long in the country, or\r\nhad not bestowed on the meteorological phenomena the attention of a\r\nstrict and close observer. Of Norna's experience he had no doubt, and\r\nthat went a far way to explain what seemed supernatural in her\r\ndemeanour. Yet still the noble countenance, half-shaded by dishevelled\r\ntresses, the air of majesty with which, in a tone of menace as well as\r\nof command, she addressed the viewless spirit of the tempest, gave him a\r\nstrong inclination to believe in the ascendency of the occult arts over\r\nthe powers of nature; for, if a woman ever moved on earth to whom such\r\nauthority over the ordinary laws of the universe could belong, Norna of\r\nFitful-head, judging from bearing, figure, and face, was born to that\r\nhigh destiny.\r\n\r\nThe rest of the company were less slow in receiving conviction. To\r\nTronda and the jagger none was necessary; they had long believed in the\r\nfull extent of Norna's authority over the elements. But Triptolemus and\r\nhis sister gazed at each other with wondering and alarmed looks,\r\nespecially when the wind began perceptibly to decline, as was remarkably\r\nvisible during the pauses which Norna made betwixt the strophes of her\r\nincantation. A long silence followed the last verse, until Norna\r\nresumed her chant, but with a changed and more soothing modulation of\r\nvoice and tune.\r\n\r\n  \"Eagle of the far north-western waters,\r\n  Thou hast heard the voice of the Reim-kennar,\r\n  Thou hast closed thy wide sails at her bidding,\r\n  And folded them in peace by thy side.\r\n  My blessing be on thy retiring path!\r\n  When thou stoopest from thy place on high,\r\n  Soft be thy slumbers in the caverns of the unknown ocean,\r\n  Rest till destiny shall again awaken thee;\r\n  Eagle of the north-west, thou hast heard the voice of the Reim-kennar!\"\r\n\r\n\"A pretty sang that would be to keep the corn from shaking in har'st,\"\r\nwhispered the agriculturist to his sister; \"we must speak her fair,\r\nBaby--she will maybe part with the secret for a hundred pund Scots.\"\r\n\r\n\"An hundred fules' heads!\" replied Baby--\"bid her five merks of ready\r\nsiller. I never knew a witch in my life but she was as poor as Job.\"\r\n\r\nNorna turned towards them as if she had guessed their thoughts; it may\r\nbe that she did so. She passed them with a look of the most sovereign\r\ncontempt, and walking to the table on which the preparations for Mrs.\r\nBarbara's frugal meal were already disposed, she filled a small wooden\r\nquaigh from an earthen pitcher which contained bland, a subacid liquor\r\nmade out of the serous part of the milk. She broke a single morsel from\r\na barley-cake, and having eaten and drunk, returned towards the churlish\r\nhosts. \"I give you no thanks,\" she said, \"for my refreshment, for you\r\nbid me not welcome to it; and thanks bestowed on a churl are like the\r\ndew of heaven on the cliffs of Foulah, where it finds nought that can\r\nbe refreshed by its influences. I give you no thanks,\" she said again,\r\nbut drawing from her pocket a leathern purse that seemed large and\r\nheavy, she added, \"I pay you with what you will value more than the\r\ngratitude of the whole inhabitants of Hialtland. Say not that Norna of\r\nFitful-head hath eaten of your bread and drunk of your cup, and left you\r\nsorrowing for the charge to which she hath put your house.\" So saying,\r\nshe laid on the table a small piece of antique gold coin, bearing the\r\nrude and half-defaced effigies of some ancient northern king.\r\n\r\nTriptolemus and his sister exclaimed against this liberality with\r\nvehemence; the first protesting that he kept no public, and the other\r\nexclaiming, \"Is the carline mad? Heard ye ever of ony of the gentle\r\nhouse of Clinkscale that gave meat for siller?\"\r\n\r\n\"Or for love either?\" muttered her brother; \"haud to that, tittie.\"\r\n\r\n\"What are ye whittie-whattieing about, ye gowk?\" said his gentle sister,\r\nwho suspected the tenor of his murmurs; \"gie the ladie back her\r\nbonnie-die there, and be blithe to be sae rid on't--it will be a\r\nsclate-stane the morn, if not something worse.\"\r\n\r\nThe honest factor lifted the money to return it, yet could not help\r\nbeing struck when he saw the impression, and his hand trembled as he\r\nhanded it to his sister.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the Pythoness again, as if she read the thoughts of the\r\nastonished pair, \"you have seen that coin before--beware how you use it!\r\nIt thrives not with the sordid or the mean-souled--it was won with\r\nhonourable danger, and must be expended with honourable liberality. The\r\ntreasure which lies under a cold hearth will one day, like the hidden\r\ntalent, bear witness against its avaricious possessors.\"\r\n\r\nThis last obscure intimation seemed to raise the alarm and the wonder of\r\nMrs. Baby and her brother to the uttermost. The latter tried to stammer\r\nout something like an invitation to Norna to tarry with them all night,\r\nor at least to take share of the \"dinner,\" so he at first called it; but\r\nlooking at the company, and remembering the limited contents of the pot,\r\nhe corrected the phrase, and hoped she would take some part of the\r\n\"snack, which would be on the table ere a man could loose a pleugh.\"\r\n\r\n\"I eat not here--I sleep not here,\" replied Norna--\"nay, I relieve you\r\nnot only of my own presence, but I will dismiss your unwelcome\r\nguests.--Mordaunt,\" she added, addressing young Mertoun, \"the dark fit\r\nis past, and your father looks for you this evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you return in that direction?\" said Mordaunt. \"I will but eat a\r\nmorsel, and give you my aid, good mother, on the road. The brooks must\r\nbe out, and the journey perilous.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our roads lie different,\" answered the Sibyl, \"and Norna needs not\r\nmortal arm to aid her on the way. I am summoned far to the east, by\r\nthose who know well how to smooth my passage.--For thee, Bryce\r\nSnailsfoot,\" she continued, speaking to the pedlar, \"speed thee on to\r\nSumburgh--the Roost will afford thee a gallant harvest, and worthy the\r\ngathering in. Much goodly ware will ere now be seeking a new owner, and\r\nthe careful skipper will sleep still enough in the deep haaf, and care\r\nnot that bale and chest are dashing against the shores.\"\r\n\r\n\"Na, na, good mother,\" answered Snailsfoot, \"I desire no man's life for\r\nmy private advantage, and am just grateful for the blessing of\r\nProvidence on my sma' trade. But doubtless one man's loss is another's\r\ngain; and as these storms destroy a' thing on land, it is but fair they\r\nsuld send us something by sea. Sae, taking the freedom, like yoursell,\r\nmother, to borrow a lump of barley-bread, and a draught of bland, I will\r\nbid good-day, and thank you, to this good gentleman and lady, and e'en\r\ngo on my way to Jarlshof, as you advise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" replied the Pythoness, \"where the slaughter is, the eagles will be\r\ngathered; and where the wreck is on the shore, the jagger is as busy to\r\npurchase spoil as the shark to gorge upon the dead.\"\r\n\r\nThis rebuke, if it was intended for such, seemed above the comprehension\r\nof the travelling merchant, who, bent upon gain, assumed the knapsack\r\nand ellwand, and asked Mordaunt, with the familiarity permitted in a\r\nwild country, whether he would not take company along with him?\r\n\r\n\"I wait to eat some dinner with Mr. Yellowley and Mrs. Baby,\" answered\r\nthe youth, \"and will set forward in half an hour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I'll just take my piece in my hand,\" said the pedlar. Accordingly\r\nhe muttered a benediction, and, without more ceremony, helped himself to\r\nwhat, in Mrs. Baby's covetous eyes, appeared to be two-thirds of the\r\nbread, took a long pull at the jug of bland, seized on a handful of the\r\nsmall fish called sillocks, which the domestic was just placing on the\r\nboard, and left the room without farther ceremony.\r\n\r\n\"My certie,\" said the despoiled Mrs. Baby, \"there is the chapman's\r\ndrouth[27] and his hunger baith, as folk say! If the laws against\r\nvagrants be executed this gate--It's no that I wad shut the door against\r\ndecent folk,\" she said, looking to Mordaunt, \"more especially in such\r\njudgment-weather. But I see the goose is dished, poor thing.\"\r\n\r\nThis she spoke in a tone of affection for the smoked goose, which,\r\nthough it had long been an inanimate inhabitant of her chimney, was far\r\nmore interesting to Mrs. Baby in that state, than when it screamed\r\namongst the clouds. Mordaunt laughed and took his seat, then turned to\r\nlook for Norna; but she had glided from the apartment during the\r\ndiscussion with the pedlar.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad she is gane, the dour carline,\" said Mrs. Baby, \"though she\r\nhas left that piece of gowd to be an everlasting shame to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whisht, mistress, for the love of heaven!\" said Tronda Dronsdaughter;\r\n\"wha kens where she may be this moment?--we are no sure but she may hear\r\nus, though we cannot see her.\"\r\n\r\nMistress Baby cast a startled eye around, and instantly recovering\r\nherself, for she was naturally courageous as well as violent, said, \"I\r\nbade her aroint before, and I bid her aroint again, whether she sees me\r\nor hears me, or whether she's ower the cairn and awa.--And you, ye silly\r\nsumph,\" she said to poor Yellowley, \"what do ye stand glowering there\r\nfor?--_You_ a Saunt Andrew's student!--_you_ studied lair and Latin\r\nhumanities, as ye ca' them, and daunted wi' the clavers of an auld\r\nrandie wife! Say your best college grace, man, and witch, or nae witch,\r\nwe'll eat our dinner, and defy her. And for the value of the gowden\r\npiece, it shall never be said I pouched her siller. I will gie it to\r\nsome poor body--that is, I will test[28] upon it at my death, and keep\r\nit for a purse-penny till that day comes, and that's no using it in the\r\nway of spending siller. Say your best college grace, man, and let us eat\r\nand drink in the meantime.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye had muckle better say an _oraamus_ to Saint Ronald, and fling a\r\nsaxpence ower your left shouther, master,\" said Tronda.[29]\r\n\r\n\"That ye may pick it up, ye jaud,\" said the implacable Mistress Baby;\r\n\"it will be lang or ye win the worth of it ony other gate.--Sit down,\r\nTriptolemus, and mindna the words of a daft wife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Daft or wise,\" replied Yellowley, very much disconcerted, \"she kens\r\nmore than I would wish she kend. It was awfu' to see sic a wind fa' at\r\nthe voice of flesh and blood like oursells--and then yon about the\r\nhearth-stane--I cannot but think\"----\r\n\r\n\"If ye cannot but think,\" said Mrs. Baby, very sharply, \"at least ye can\r\nhaud your tongue?\"\r\n\r\nThe agriculturist made no reply, but sate down to their scanty meal, and\r\ndid the honours of it with unusual heartiness to his new guest, the\r\nfirst of the intruders who had arrived, and the last who left them. The\r\nsillocks speedily disappeared, and the smoked goose, with its\r\nappendages, took wing so effectually, that Tronda, to whom the polishing\r\nof the bones had been destined, found the task accomplished, or nearly\r\nso, to her hand. After dinner, the host produced his bottle of brandy;\r\nbut Mordaunt, whose general habits were as abstinent almost as those of\r\nhis father, laid a very light tax upon this unusual exertion of\r\nhospitality.\r\n\r\nDuring the meal, they learned so much of young Mordaunt, and of his\r\nfather, that even Baby resisted his wish to reassume his wet garments,\r\nand pressed him (at the risk of an expensive supper being added to the\r\ncharges of the day) to tarry with them till the next morning. But what\r\nNorna had said excited the youth's wish to reach home, nor, however far\r\nthe hospitality of Stourburgh was extended in his behalf, did the house\r\npresent any particular temptations to induce him to remain there longer.\r\nHe therefore accepted the loan of the factor's clothes, promising to\r\nreturn them, and send for his own; and took a civil leave of his host\r\nand Mistress Baby, the latter of whom, however affected by the loss of\r\nher goose, could not but think the cost well bestowed (since it was to\r\nbe expended at all) upon so handsome and cheerful a youth.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[26] The beetle with which the Scottish housewives used to perform the\r\noffice of the modern mangle, by beating newly-washed linen on a smooth\r\nstone for the purpose, called the beetling-stone.\r\n\r\n[27] The chapman's drouth, that is, the pedlar's thirst, is proverbial\r\nin Scotland, because these pedestrian traders were in the use of\r\nmodestly asking only for a drink of water, when, in fact, they were\r\ndesirous of food.\r\n\r\n[28] Test upon it, _i. e._, leave it in my will; a mode of bestowing\r\ncharity, to which many are partial as well as the good dame in the text.\r\n\r\n[29] Although the Zetlanders were early reconciled to the reformed\r\nfaith, some ancient practices of Catholic superstition survived long\r\namong them. In very stormy weather a fisher would vow an _oramus_ to\r\nSaint Ronald, and acquitted himself of the obligation by throwing a\r\nsmall piece of money in at the window of a ruinous chapel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  She does no work by halves, yon raving ocean;\r\n  Engulfing those she strangles, her wild womb\r\n  Affords the mariners whom she hath dealt on,\r\n  Their death at once, and sepulchre.\r\n\r\n                                                 _Old Play._\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were ten \"lang Scots miles\" betwixt Stourburgh and Jarlshof; and\r\nthough the pedestrian did not number all the impediments which crossed\r\nTam o' Shanter's path,--for in a country where there are neither hedges\r\nnor stone enclosures, there can be neither \"slaps nor stiles,\"--yet the\r\nnumber and nature of the \"mosses and waters\" which he had to cross in\r\nhis peregrination, was fully sufficient to balance the account, and to\r\nrender his journey as toilsome and dangerous as Tam o' Shanter's\r\ncelebrated retreat from Ayr. Neither witch nor warlock crossed\r\nMordaunt's path, however. The length of the day was already\r\nconsiderable, and he arrived safe at Jarlshof by eleven o'clock at\r\nnight. All was still and dark round the mansion, and it was not till he\r\nhad whistled twice or thrice beneath Swertha's window, that she replied\r\nto the signal.\r\n\r\nAt the first sound, Swertha fell into an agreeable dream of a young\r\nwhale-fisher, who some forty years before used to make such a signal\r\nbeneath the window of her hut; at the second, she waked to remember that\r\nJohnnie Fea had slept sound among the frozen waves of Greenland for this\r\nmany a year, and that she was Mr. Mertoun's governante at Jarlshof; at\r\nthe third, she arose and opened the window.\r\n\r\n\"Whae is that,\" she demanded, \"at sic an hour of the night?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is I,\" said the youth.\r\n\r\n\"And what for comena ye in? The door's on the latch, and there is a\r\ngathering peat on the kitchen fire, and a spunk beside it--ye can light\r\nyour ain candle.\"\r\n\r\n\"All well,\" replied Mordaunt; \"but I want to know how my father is?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just in his ordinary, gude gentleman--asking for you, Maister Mordaunt;\r\nye are ower far and ower late in your walks, young gentleman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then the dark hour has passed, Swertha?\"\r\n\r\n\"In troth has it, Maister Mordaunt,\" answered the governante; \"and your\r\nfather is very reasonably good-natured for him, poor gentleman. I spake\r\nto him twice yesterday without his speaking first; and the first time he\r\nanswered me as civil as you could do, and the neist time he bade me no\r\nplague him; and then, thought I, three times were aye canny, so I spake\r\nto him again for luck's-sake, and he called me a chattering old devil;\r\nbut it was quite and clean in a civil sort of way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough, enough, Swertha,\" answered Mordaunt; \"and now get up, and find\r\nme something to eat, for I have dined but poorly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you have been at the new folk's at Stourburgh; for there is no\r\nanother house in a' the Isles but they wad hae gi'en ye the best share\r\nof the best they had. Saw ye aught of Norna of the Fitful-head? She went\r\nto Stourburgh this morning, and returned to the town at night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Returned!--then she is here? How could she travel three leagues and\r\nbetter in so short a time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wha kens how she travels?\" replied Swertha; \"but I heard her tell the\r\nRanzelman wi' my ain lugs, that she intended that day to have gone on to\r\nBurgh-Westra, to speak with Minna Troil, but she had seen that at\r\nStourburgh, (indeed she said at Harfra, for she never calls it by the\r\nother name of Stourburgh,) that sent her back to our town. But gang your\r\nways round, and ye shall have plenty of supper--ours is nae toom pantry,\r\nand still less a locked ane, though my master be a stranger, and no just\r\nthat tight in the upper rigging, as the Ranzelman says.\"\r\n\r\nMordaunt walked round to the kitchen accordingly, where Swertha's care\r\nspeedily accommodated him with a plentiful, though coarse meal, which\r\nindemnified him for the scanty hospitality he had experienced at\r\nStourburgh.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, some feelings of fatigue made young Mertoun later than\r\nusual in leaving his bed; so that, contrary to what was the ordinary\r\ncase, he found his father in the apartment where they eat, and which\r\nserved them indeed for every common purpose, save that of a bedchamber\r\nor of a kitchen. The son greeted the father in mute reverence, and\r\nwaited until he should address him.\r\n\r\n\"You were absent yesterday, Mordaunt?\" said his father. Mordaunt's\r\nabsence had lasted a week and more; but he had often observed that his\r\nfather never seemed to notice how time passed during the period when he\r\nwas affected with his sullen vapours. He assented to what the elder Mr.\r\nMertoun had said.\r\n\r\n\"And you were at Burgh-Westra, as I think?\" continued his father.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" replied Mordaunt.\r\n\r\nThe elder Mertoun was then silent for some time, and paced the floor in\r\ndeep silence, with an air of sombre reflection, which seemed as if he\r\nwere about to relapse into his moody fit. Suddenly turning to his son,\r\nhowever, he observed, in the tone of a query, \"Magnus Troil has two\r\ndaughters--they must be now young women; they are thought handsome, of\r\ncourse?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very generally, sir,\" answered Mordaunt, rather surprised to hear his\r\nfather making any enquiries about the individuals of a sex which he\r\nusually thought so light of, a surprise which was much increased by the\r\nnext question, put as abruptly as the former.\r\n\r\n\"Which think you the handsomest?\"\r\n\r\n\"I, sir?\" replied his son with some wonder, but without\r\nembarrassment--\"I really am no judge--I never considered which was\r\nabsolutely the handsomest. They are both very pretty young women.\"\r\n\r\n\"You evade my question, Mordaunt; perhaps I have some very particular\r\nreason for my wish to be acquainted with your taste in this matter. I am\r\nnot used to waste words for no purpose. I ask you again, which of Magnus\r\nTroil's daughters you think most handsome?\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, sir,\" replied Mordaunt--\"but you only jest in asking me such a\r\nquestion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Young man,\" replied Mertoun, with eyes which began to roll and sparkle\r\nwith impatience, \"I _never_ jest. I desire an answer to my question.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, upon my word, sir,\" said Mordaunt, \"it is not in my power to form\r\na judgment betwixt the young ladies--they are both very pretty, but by\r\nno means like each other. Minna is dark-haired, and more grave than her\r\nsister--more serious, but by no means either dull or sullen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Um,\" replied his father; \"you have been gravely brought up, and this\r\nMinna, I suppose, pleases you most?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir, really I can give her no preference over her sister Brenda,\r\nwho is as gay as a lamb in a spring morning--less tall than her sister,\r\nbut so well formed, and so excellent a dancer\"----\r\n\r\n\"That she is best qualified to amuse the young man, who has a dull home\r\nand a moody father?\" said Mr. Mertoun.\r\n\r\nNothing in his father's conduct had ever surprised Mordaunt so much as\r\nthe obstinacy with which he seemed to pursue a theme so foreign to his\r\ngeneral train of thought, and habits of conversation; but he contented\r\nhimself with answering once more, \"that both the young ladies were\r\nhighly admirable, but he had never thought of them with the wish to do\r\neither injustice, by ranking her lower than her sister--that others\r\nwould probably decide between them, as they happened to be partial to a\r\ngrave or a gay disposition, or to a dark or fair complexion; but that he\r\ncould see no excellent quality in the one that was not balanced by\r\nsomething equally captivating in the other.\"\r\n\r\nIt is possible that even the coolness with which Mordaunt made this\r\nexplanation might not have satisfied his father concerning the subject\r\nof investigation; but Swertha at this moment entered with breakfast, and\r\nthe youth, notwithstanding his late supper, engaged in that meal with an\r\nair which satisfied Mertoun that he held it matter of more grave\r\nimportance than the conversation which they had just had, and that he\r\nhad nothing more to say upon the subject explanatory of the answers he\r\nhad already given. He shaded his brow with his hand, and looked long\r\nfixedly upon the young man as he was busied with his morning meal. There\r\nwas neither abstraction nor a sense of being observed in any of his\r\nmotions; all was frank, natural, and open.\r\n\r\n\"He is fancy-free,\" muttered Mertoun to himself--\"so young, so lively,\r\nand so imaginative, so handsome and so attractive in face and person,\r\nstrange, that at his age, and in his circumstances, he should have\r\navoided the meshes which catch all the world beside!\"\r\n\r\nWhen the breakfast was over, the elder Mertoun, instead of proposing, as\r\nusual, that his son, who awaited his commands, should betake himself to\r\none branch or other of his studies, assumed his hat and staff, and\r\ndesired that Mordaunt should accompany him to the top of the cliff,\r\ncalled Sumburgh-head, and from thence look out upon the state of the\r\nocean, agitated as it must still be by the tempest of the preceding day.\r\nMordaunt was at the age when young men willingly exchange sedentary\r\npursuits for active exercise, and started up with alacrity to comply\r\nwith his father's desire; and in the course of a few minutes they were\r\nmounting together the hill, which, ascending from the land side in a\r\nlong, steep, and grassy slope, sinks at once from the summit to the sea\r\nin an abrupt and tremendous precipice.\r\n\r\nThe day was delightful; there was just so much motion in the air as to\r\ndisturb the little fleecy clouds which were scattered on the horizon,\r\nand by floating them occasionally over the sun, to chequer the landscape\r\nwith that variety of light and shade which often gives to a bare and\r\nunenclosed scene, for the time at least, a species of charm approaching\r\nto the varieties of a cultivated and planted country. A thousand\r\nflitting hues of light and shade played over the expanse of wild moor,\r\nrocks, and inlets, which, as they climbed higher and higher, spread in\r\nwide and wider circuit around them.\r\n\r\nThe elder Mertoun often paused and looked round upon the scene, and for\r\nsome time his son supposed that he halted to enjoy its beauties; but as\r\nthey ascended still higher up the hill, he remarked his shortened breath\r\nand his uncertain and toilsome step, and became assured, with some\r\nfeelings of alarm, that his father's strength was, for the moment,\r\nexhausted, and that he found the ascent more toilsome and fatiguing than\r\nusual. To draw close to his side, and offer him in silence the\r\nassistance of his arm, was an act of youthful deference to advanced age,\r\nas well as of filial reverence; and Mertoun seemed at first so to\r\nreceive it, for he took in silence the advantage of the aid thus\r\nafforded him.\r\n\r\nIt was but for two or three minutes, however, that the father availed\r\nhimself of his son's support. They had not ascended fifty yards farther,\r\nere he pushed Mordaunt suddenly, if not rudely, from him; and, as if\r\nstung into exertion by some sudden recollection, began to mount the\r\nacclivity with such long and quick steps, that Mordaunt, in his turn,\r\nwas obliged to exert himself to keep pace with him. He knew his father's\r\npeculiarity of disposition; he was aware from many slight circumstances,\r\nthat he loved him not even while he took much pains with his education,\r\nand while he seemed to be the sole object of his care upon earth. But\r\nthe conviction had never been more strongly or more powerfully forced\r\nupon him than by the hasty churlishness with which Mertoun rejected from\r\na son that assistance, which most elderly men are willing to receive\r\nfrom youths with whom they are but slightly connected, as a tribute\r\nwhich it is alike graceful to yield and pleasing to receive. Mertoun,\r\nhowever, did not seem to perceive the effect which his unkindness had\r\nproduced upon his son's feelings. He paused upon a sort of level terrace\r\nwhich they had now attained, and addressed his son with an indifferent\r\ntone, which seemed in some degree affected.\r\n\r\n\"Since you have so few inducements, Mordaunt, to remain in these wild\r\nislands, I suppose you sometimes wish to look a little more abroad into\r\nthe world?\"\r\n\r\n\"By my word, sir,\" replied Mordaunt, \"I cannot say I ever have a thought\r\non such a subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not, young man?\" demanded his father; \"it were but natural, I\r\nthink, at your age. At your age, the fair and varied breadth of Britain\r\ncould not gratify me, much less the compass of a sea-girdled peat-moss.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have never thought of leaving Zetland, sir,\" replied the son. \"I am\r\nhappy here, and have friends. You yourself, sir, would miss me, unless\r\nindeed\"----\r\n\r\n\"Why, thou wouldst not persuade me,\" said his father, somewhat hastily,\r\n\"that you stay here, or desire to stay here, for the love of me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should I not, sir?\" answered Mordaunt, mildly; \"it is my duty, and\r\nI hope I have hitherto performed it.\"\r\n\r\n\"O ay,\" repeated Mertoun, in the same tone--\"your duty--your duty. So it\r\nis the duty of the dog to follow the groom that feeds him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And does he not do so, sir?\" said Mordaunt.\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" said his father, turning his head aside: \"but he fawns only on\r\nthose who caress him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope, sir,\" replied Mordaunt, \"I have not been found deficient?\"\r\n\r\n\"Say no more on't--say no more on't,\" said Mertoun, abruptly, \"we have\r\nboth done enough by each other--we must soon part--Let that be our\r\ncomfort--if our separation should require comfort.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall be ready to obey your wishes,\" said Mordaunt, not altogether\r\ndispleased at what promised him an opportunity of looking farther abroad\r\ninto the world. \"I presume it will be your pleasure that I commence my\r\ntravels with a season at the whale-fishing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whale-fishing!\" replied Mertoun; \"that were a mode indeed of seeing the\r\nworld! but thou speakest but as thou hast learned. Enough of this for\r\nthe present. Tell me where you had shelter from the storm yesterday?\"\r\n\r\n\"At Stourburgh, the house of the new factor from Scotland.\"\r\n\r\n\"A pedantic, fantastic, visionary schemer,\" said Mertoun--\"and whom saw\r\nyou there?\"\r\n\r\n\"His sister, sir,\" replied Mordaunt, \"and old Norna of the Fitful-head.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! the mistress of the potent spell,\" answered Mertoun, with a\r\nsneer--\"she who can change the wind by pulling her curch on one side, as\r\nKing Erick used to do by turning his cap? The dame journeys far from\r\nhome--how fares she? Does she get rich by selling favourable winds to\r\nthose who are port-bound?\"[30]\r\n\r\n\"I really do not know, sir,\" said Mordaunt, whom certain recollections\r\nprevented from freely entering into his father's humour.\r\n\r\n\"You think the matter too serious to be jested with, or perhaps esteem\r\nher merchandise too light to be cared after,\" continued Mertoun, in the\r\nsame sarcastic tone, which was the nearest approach he ever made to\r\ncheerfulness; \"but consider it more deeply. Every thing in the universe\r\nis bought and sold, and why not wind, if the merchant can find\r\npurchasers? The earth is rented, from its surface down to its most\r\ncentral mines;--the fire, and the means of feeding it, are currently\r\nbought and sold;--the wretches that sweep the boisterous ocean with\r\ntheir nets, pay ransom for the privilege of being drowned in it. What\r\ntitle has the air to be exempted from the universal course of traffic?\r\nAll above the earth, under the earth, and around the earth, has its\r\nprice, its sellers, and its purchasers. In many countries the priests\r\nwill sell you a portion of heaven--in all countries men are willing to\r\nbuy, in exchange for health, wealth, and peace of conscience, a full\r\nallowance of hell. Why should not Norna pursue her traffic?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, I know no reason against it,\" replied Mordaunt; \"only I wish she\r\nwould part with the commodity in smaller quantities. Yesterday she was a\r\nwholesale dealer--whoever treated with her had too good a pennyworth.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is even so,\" said his father, pausing on the verge of the wild\r\npromontory which they had attained, where the huge precipice sinks\r\nabruptly down on the wide and tempestuous ocean, \"and the effects are\r\nstill visible.\"\r\n\r\nThe face of that lofty cape is composed of the soft and crumbling stone\r\ncalled sand-flag, which gradually becomes decomposed, and yields to the\r\naction of the atmosphere, and is split into large masses, that hang\r\nloose upon the verge of the precipice, and, detached from it by the\r\nviolence of the tempests, often descend with great fury into the vexed\r\nabyss which lashes the foot of the rock. Numbers of these huge fragments\r\nlie strewed beneath the rocks from which they have fallen, and amongst\r\nthese the tide foams and rages with a fury peculiar to those latitudes.\r\n\r\nAt the period when Mertoun and his son looked from the verge of the\r\nprecipice, the wide sea still heaved and swelled with the agitation of\r\nyesterday's storm, which had been far too violent in its effects on the\r\nocean to subside speedily. The tide therefore poured on the headland\r\nwith a fury deafening to the ear, and dizzying to the eye, threatening\r\ninstant destruction to whatever might be at the time involved in its\r\ncurrent. The sight of Nature, in her magnificence, or in her beauty, or\r\nin her terrors, has at all times an overpowering interest, which even\r\nhabit cannot greatly weaken; and both father and son sat themselves down\r\non the cliff to look out upon that unbounded war of waters, which rolled\r\nin their wrath to the foot of the precipice.\r\n\r\nAt once Mordaunt, whose eyes were sharper, and probably his attention\r\nmore alert, than that of his father, started up, and exclaimed, \"God in\r\nHeaven! there is a vessel in the Roost!\"\r\n\r\nMertoun looked to the north-westward, and an object was visible amid the\r\nrolling tide. \"She shows no sail,\" he observed; and immediately added,\r\nafter looking at the object through his spy-glass, \"She is dismasted,\r\nand lies a sheer hulk upon the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is drifting on the Sumburgh-head,\" exclaimed Mordaunt, struck with\r\nhorror, \"without the slightest means of weathering the cape!\"\r\n\r\n\"She makes no effort,\" answered his father; \"she is probably deserted by\r\nher crew.\"\r\n\r\n\"And in such a day as yesterday,\" replied Mordaunt, \"when no open boat\r\ncould live were she manned with the best men ever handled an oar--all\r\nmust have perished.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is most probable,\" said his father, with stern composure; \"and one\r\nday, sooner or later, all must have perished. What signifies whether the\r\nfowler, whom nothing escapes, caught them up at one swoop from yonder\r\nshattered deck, or whether he clutched them individually, as chance gave\r\nthem to his grasp? What signifies it?--the deck, the battlefield, are\r\nscarce more fatal to us than our table and our bed; and we are saved\r\nfrom the one, merely to drag out a heartless and wearisome existence,\r\ntill we perish at the other. Would the hour were come--that hour which\r\nreason would teach us to wish for, were it not that nature has implanted\r\nthe fear of it so strongly within us! You wonder at such a reflection,\r\nbecause life is yet new to you. Ere you have attained my age, it will be\r\nthe familiar companion of your thoughts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely, sir,\" replied Mordaunt, \"such distaste to life is not the\r\nnecessary consequence of advanced age?\"\r\n\r\n\"To all who have sense to estimate that which it is really worth,\" said\r\nMertoun. \"Those who, like Magnus Troil, possess so much of the animal\r\nimpulses about them, as to derive pleasure from sensual gratification,\r\nmay perhaps, like the animals, feel pleasure in mere existence.\"\r\n\r\nMordaunt liked neither the doctrine nor the example. He thought a man\r\nwho discharged his duties towards others as well as the good old\r\nUdaller, had a better right to have the sun shine fair on his setting,\r\nthan that which he might derive from mere insensibility. But he let the\r\nsubject drop; for to dispute with his father, had always the effect of\r\nirritating him; and again he adverted to the condition of the wreck.\r\n\r\nThe hulk, for it was little better, was now in the very midst of the\r\ncurrent, and drifting at a great rate towards the foot of the precipice,\r\nupon whose verge they were placed. Yet it was a long while ere they had\r\na distinct view of the object which they had at first seen as a black\r\nspeck amongst the waters, and then, at a nearer distance, like a whale,\r\nwhich now scarce shows its back-fin above the waves, now throws to view\r\nits large black side. Now, however, they could more distinctly observe\r\nthe appearance of the ship, for the huge swelling waves which bore her\r\nforward to the shore, heaved her alternately high upon the surface, and\r\nthen plunged her into the trough or furrow of the sea. She seemed a\r\nvessel of two or three hundred tons, fitted up for defence, for they\r\ncould see her port-holes. She had been dismasted probably in the gale of\r\nthe preceding day, and lay water-logged on the waves, a prey to their\r\nviolence. It appeared certain, that the crew, finding themselves unable\r\neither to direct the vessel's course, or to relieve her by pumping, had\r\ntaken to their boats, and left her to her fate. All apprehensions were\r\ntherefore unnecessary, so far as the immediate loss of human lives was\r\nconcerned; and yet it was not without a feeling of breathless awe that\r\nMordaunt and his father beheld the vessel--that rare masterpiece by\r\nwhich human genius aspires to surmount the waves, and contend with the\r\nwinds, upon the point of falling a prey to them.\r\n\r\nOnward she came, the large black hulk seeming larger at every fathom's\r\nlength. She came nearer, until she bestrode the summit of one tremendous\r\nbillow, which rolled on with her unbroken, till the wave and its burden\r\nwere precipitated against the rock, and then the triumph of the elements\r\nover the work of human hands was at once completed. One wave, we have\r\nsaid, made the wrecked vessel completely manifest in her whole bulk, as\r\nit raised her, and bore her onward against the face of the precipice.\r\nBut when that wave receded from the foot of the rock, the ship had\r\nceased to exist; and the retiring billow only bore back a quantity of\r\nbeams, planks, casks, and similar objects, which swept out to the\r\noffing, to be brought in again by the next wave, and again precipitated\r\nupon the face of the rock.\r\n\r\nIt was at this moment that Mordaunt conceived he saw a man floating on a\r\nplank or water-cask, which, drifting away from the main current, seemed\r\nabout to go ashore upon a small spot of sand, where the water was\r\nshallow, and the waves broke more smoothly. To see the danger, and to\r\nexclaim, \"He lives, and may yet be saved!\" was the first impulse of the\r\nfearless Mordaunt. The next was, after one rapid glance at the front of\r\nthe cliff, to precipitate himself--such seemed the rapidity of his\r\nmovement--from the verge, and to commence, by means of slight fissures,\r\nprojections, and crevices in the rock, a descent, which, to a spectator,\r\nappeared little else than an act of absolute insanity.\r\n\r\n\"Stop, I command you, rash boy!\" said his father; \"the attempt is death.\r\nStop, and take the safer path to the left.\" But Mordaunt was already\r\ncompletely engaged in his perilous enterprise.\r\n\r\n\"Why should I prevent him?\" said his father, checking his anxiety with\r\nthe stern and unfeeling philosophy whose principles he had adopted.\r\n\"Should he die now, full of generous and high feeling, eager in the\r\ncause of humanity, happy in the exertion of his own conscious activity,\r\nand youthful strength--should he die now, will he not escape\r\nmisanthropy, and remorse, and age, and the consciousness of decaying\r\npowers, both of body and mind?--I will not look upon it however--I will\r\nnot--I cannot behold his young light so suddenly quenched.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned from the precipice accordingly, and hastening to the left for\r\nmore than a quarter of a mile, he proceeded towards a _riva_, or cleft\r\nin the rock, containing a path, called Erick's Steps, neither safe,\r\nindeed, nor easy, but the only one by which the inhabitants of Jarlshof\r\nwere wont, for any purpose, to seek access to the foot of the precipice.\r\n\r\nBut long ere Mertoun had reached even the upper end of the pass, his\r\nadventurous and active son had accomplished his more desperate\r\nenterprise. He had been in vain turned aside from the direct line of\r\ndescent, by the intervention of difficulties which he had not seen from\r\nabove--his route became only more circuitous, but could not be\r\ninterrupted. More than once, large fragments to which he was about to\r\nintrust his weight, gave way before him, and thundered down into the\r\ntormented ocean; and in one or two instances, such detached pieces of\r\nrock rushed after him, as if to bear him headlong in their course. A\r\ncourageous heart, a steady eye, a tenacious hand, and a firm foot,\r\ncarried him through his desperate attempt; and in the space of seven\r\nminutes, he stood at the bottom of the cliff, from the verge of which\r\nhe had achieved his perilous descent.\r\n\r\nThe place which he now occupied was the small projecting spot of stones,\r\nsand, and gravel, that extended a little way into the sea, which on the\r\nright hand lashed the very bottom of the precipice, and on the left, was\r\nscarce divided from it by a small wave-worn portion of beach that\r\nextended as far as the foot of the rent in the rocks called Erick's\r\nSteps, by which Mordaunt's father proposed to descend.\r\n\r\nWhen the vessel split and went to pieces, all was swallowed up in the\r\nocean, which had, after the first shock, been seen to float upon the\r\nwaves, excepting only a few pieces of wreck, casks, chests, and the\r\nlike, which a strong eddy, formed by the reflux of the waves, had\r\nlanded, or at least grounded, upon the shallow where Mordaunt now stood.\r\nAmongst these, his eager eye discovered the object that had at first\r\nengaged his attention, and which now, seen at nigher distance, proved to\r\nbe in truth a man, and in a most precarious state. His arms were still\r\nwrapt with a close and convulsive grasp round the plank to which he had\r\nclung in the moment of the shock, but sense and the power of motion were\r\nfled; and, from the situation in which the plank lay, partly grounded\r\nupon the beach, partly floating in the sea, there was every chance that\r\nit might be again washed off shore, in which case death was inevitable.\r\nJust as he had made himself aware of these circumstances, Mordaunt\r\nbeheld a huge wave advancing, and hastened to interpose his aid ere it\r\nburst, aware that the reflux might probably sweep away the sufferer.\r\n\r\nHe rushed into the surf, and fastened on the body, with the same\r\ntenacity, though under a different impulse, with that wherewith the\r\nhound seizes his prey. The strength of the retiring wave proved even\r\ngreater than he had expected, and it was not without a struggle for his\r\nown life, as well as for that of the stranger, that Mordaunt resisted\r\nbeing swept off with the receding billow, when, though an adroit\r\nswimmer, the strength of the tide must either have dashed him against\r\nthe rocks, or hurried him out to sea. He stood his ground, however, and\r\nere another such billow had returned, he drew up, upon the small slip of\r\ndry sand, both the body of the stranger, and the plank to which he\r\ncontinued firmly attached. But how to save and to recall the means of\r\nebbing life and strength, and how to remove into a place of greater\r\nsafety the sufferer, who was incapable of giving any assistance towards\r\nhis own preservation, were questions which Mordaunt asked himself\r\neagerly, but in vain.\r\n\r\nHe looked to the summit of the cliff on which he had left his father,\r\nand shouted to him for his assistance; but his eye could not distinguish\r\nhis form, and his voice was only answered by the scream of the\r\nsea-birds. He gazed again on the sufferer. A dress richly laced,\r\naccording to the fashion of the times, fine linen, and rings upon his\r\nfingers, evinced he was a man of superior rank; and his features showed\r\nyouth and comeliness, notwithstanding they were pallid and disfigured.\r\nHe still breathed, but so feebly, that his respiration was almost\r\nimperceptible, and life seemed to keep such slight hold of his frame,\r\nthat there was every reason to fear it would become altogether\r\nextinguished, unless it were speedily reinforced. To loosen the\r\nhandkerchief from his neck, to raise him with his face towards the\r\nbreeze, to support him with his arms, was all that Mordaunt could do for\r\nhis assistance, whilst he anxiously looked for some one who might lend\r\nhis aid in dragging the unfortunate to a more safe situation.\r\n\r\nAt this moment he beheld a man advancing slowly and cautiously along the\r\nbeach. He was in hopes, at first, it was his father, but instantly\r\nrecollected that he had not had time to come round by the circuitous\r\ndescent, to which he must necessarily have recourse, and besides, he saw\r\nthat the man who approached him was shorter in stature.\r\n\r\nAs he came nearer, Mordaunt was at no loss to recognise the pedlar whom\r\nthe day before he had met with at Harfra, and who was known to him\r\nbefore upon many occasions. He shouted as loud as he could, \"Bryce,\r\nhollo! Bryce, come hither!\" But the merchant, intent upon picking up\r\nsome of the spoils of the wreck, and upon dragging them out of reach of\r\nthe tide, paid for some time little attention to his shouts.\r\n\r\nWhen he did at length approach Mordaunt, it was not to lend him his aid,\r\nbut to remonstrate with him on his rashness in undertaking the\r\ncharitable office. \"Are you mad?\" said he; \"you that have lived sae lang\r\nin Zetland, to risk the saving of a drowning man? Wot ye not, if you\r\nbring him to life again, he will be sure to do you some capital\r\ninjury?[31]--Come, Master Mordaunt, bear a hand to what's mair to the\r\npurpose. Help me to get ane or twa of these kists ashore before any body\r\nelse comes, and we shall share, like good Christians, what God sends us,\r\nand be thankful.\"\r\n\r\nMordaunt was indeed no stranger to this inhuman superstition, current at\r\na former period among the lower orders of the Zetlanders, and the more\r\ngenerally adopted, perhaps, that it served as an apology for refusing\r\nassistance to the unfortunate victims of shipwreck, while they made\r\nplunder of their goods. At any rate, the opinion, that to save a\r\ndrowning man was to run the risk of future injury from him, formed a\r\nstrange contradiction in the character of these islanders; who,\r\nhospitable, generous, and disinterested, on all other occasions, were\r\nsometimes, nevertheless, induced by this superstition, to refuse their\r\naid in those mortal emergencies, which were so common upon their rocky\r\nand stormy coasts. We are happy to add, that the exhortation and example\r\nof the proprietors have eradicated even the traces of this inhuman\r\nbelief, of which there might be some observed within the memory of those\r\nnow alive. It is strange that the minds of men should have ever been\r\nhardened towards those involved in a distress to which they themselves\r\nwere so constantly exposed; but perhaps the frequent sight and\r\nconsciousness of such danger tends to blunt the feelings to its\r\nconsequences, whether affecting ourselves or others.\r\n\r\nBryce was remarkably tenacious of this ancient belief; the more so,\r\nperhaps, that the mounting of his pack depended less upon the warehouses\r\nof Lerwick or Kirkwall, than on the consequences of such a north-western\r\ngale as that of the day preceding; for which (being a man who, in his\r\nown way, professed great devotion) he seldom failed to express his\r\ngrateful thanks to Heaven. It was indeed said of him, that if he had\r\nspent the same time in assisting the wrecked seamen, which he had\r\nemployed in rifling their bales and boxes, he would have saved many\r\nlives, and lost much linen. He paid no sort of attention to the\r\nrepeated entreaties of Mordaunt, although he was now upon the same slip\r\nof sand with him. It was well known to Bryce as a place on which the\r\neddy was likely to land such spoils as the ocean disgorged; and to\r\nimprove the favourable moment, he occupied himself exclusively in\r\nsecuring and appropriating whatever seemed most portable and of greatest\r\nvalue. At length Mordaunt saw the honest pedlar fix his views upon a\r\nstrong sea-chest, framed of some Indian wood, well secured by brass\r\nplates, and seeming to be of a foreign construction. The stout lock\r\nresisted all Bryce's efforts to open it, until, with great composure, he\r\nplucked from his pocket a very neat hammer and chisel, and began forcing\r\nthe hinges.\r\n\r\nIncensed beyond patience at his assurance, Mordaunt caught up a wooden\r\nstretcher which lay near him, and laying his charge softly on the sand,\r\napproached Bryce with a menacing gesture, and exclaimed, \"You\r\ncold-blooded, inhuman rascal! either get up instantly and lend me your\r\nassistance to recover this man, and bear him out of danger from the\r\nsurf, or I will not only beat you to a mummy on the spot, but inform\r\nMagnus Troil of your thievery, that he may have you flogged till your\r\nbones are bare, and then banish you from the Mainland!\"\r\n\r\nThe lid of the chest had just sprung open as this rough address saluted\r\nBryce's ears, and the inside presented a tempting view of wearing\r\napparel for sea and land; shirts, plain and with lace ruffles, a silver\r\ncompass, a silver-hilted sword, and other valuable articles, which the\r\npedlar well knew to be such as stir in the trade. He was half-disposed\r\nto start up, draw the sword, which was a cut-and-thrust, and \"darraign\r\nbattaile,\" as Spenser says, rather than quit his prize, or brook\r\ninterruption. Being, though short, a stout square-made personage, and\r\nnot much past the prime of life, having besides the better weapon, he\r\nmight have given Mordaunt more trouble than his benevolent\r\nknight-errantry deserved.\r\n\r\nAlready, as with vehemence he repeated his injunctions that Bryce should\r\nforbear his plunder, and come to the assistance of the dying man, the\r\npedlar retorted with a voice of defiance, \"Dinna swear, sir; dinna\r\nswear, sir--I will endure no swearing in my presence; and if you lay a\r\nfinger on me, that am taking the lawful spoil of the Egyptians, I will\r\ngive ye a lesson ye shall remember from this day to Yule!\"\r\n\r\nMordaunt would speedily have put the pedlar's courage to the test, but a\r\nvoice behind him suddenly said, \"Forbear!\" It was the voice of Norna of\r\nthe Fitful-head, who, during the heat of their altercation, had\r\napproached them unobserved. \"Forbear!\" she repeated; \"and, Bryce, do\r\nthou render Mordaunt the assistance he requires. It shall avail thee\r\nmore, and it is I who say the word, than all that you could earn to-day\r\nbesides.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is se'enteen hundred linen,\" said the pedlar, giving a tweak to one\r\nof the shirts, in that knowing manner with which matrons and judges\r\nascertain the texture of the loom;--\"it's se'enteen hundred linen, and\r\nas strong as an it were dowlas. Nevertheless, mother, your bidding is to\r\nbe done; and I would have done Mr. Mordaunt's bidding too,\" he added,\r\nrelaxing from his note of defiance into the deferential whining tone\r\nwith which he cajoled his customers, \"if he hadna made use of profane\r\noaths, which made my very flesh grew, and caused me, in some sort, to\r\nforget myself.\" He then took a flask from his pocket, and approached\r\nthe shipwrecked man. \"It's the best of brandy,\" he said; \"and if that\r\ndoesna cure him, I ken nought that will.\" So saying, he took a\r\npreliminary gulp himself, as if to show the quality of the liquor, and\r\nwas about to put it to the man's mouth, when, suddenly withholding his\r\nhand, he looked at Norna--\"You ensure me against all risk of evil from\r\nhim, if I am to render him my help?--Ye ken yoursell what folk say,\r\nmother.\"\r\n\r\nFor all other answer, Norna took the bottle from the pedlar's hand, and\r\nbegan to chafe the temples and throat of the shipwrecked man; directing\r\nMordaunt how to hold his head, so as to afford him the means of\r\ndisgorging the sea-water which he had swallowed during his immersion.\r\n\r\nThe pedlar looked on inactive for a moment, and then said, \"To be sure,\r\nthere is not the same risk in helping him, now he is out of the water,\r\nand lying high and dry on the beach; and, to be sure, the principal\r\ndanger is to those that first touch him; and, to be sure, it is a\r\nworld's pity to see how these rings are pinching the puir creature's\r\nswalled fingers--they make his hand as blue as a partan's back before\r\nboiling.\" So saying, he seized one of the man's cold hands, which had\r\njust, by a tremulous motion, indicated the return of life, and began his\r\ncharitable work of removing the rings, which seemed to be of some value.\r\n\r\n\"As you love your life, forbear,\" said Norna, sternly, \"or I will lay\r\nthat on you which shall spoil your travels through the isles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, for mercy's sake, mother, say nae mair about it,\" said the pedlar,\r\n\"and I'll e'en do your pleasure in your ain way! I _did_ feel a\r\nrheumatize in my back-spauld yestreen; and it wad be a sair thing for\r\nthe like of me to be debarred my quiet walk round the country, in the\r\nway of trade--making the honest penny, and helping myself with what\r\nProvidence sends on our coasts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Peace, then,\" said the woman--\"Peace, as thou wouldst not rue it; and\r\ntake this man on thy broad shoulders. His life is of value, and you will\r\nbe rewarded.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had muckle need,\" said the pedlar, pensively looking at the lidless\r\nchest, and the other matters which strewed the sand; \"for he has come\r\nbetween me and as muckle spreacherie as wad hae made a man of me for the\r\nrest of my life; and now it maun lie here till the next tide sweep it a'\r\ndoun the Roost, after them that aught it yesterday morning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear not,\" said Norna, \"it will come to man's use. See, there come\r\ncarrion-crows, of scent as keen as thine own.\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke truly; for several of the people from the hamlet of Jarlshof\r\nwere now hastening along the beach, to have their share in the spoil.\r\nThe pedlar beheld them approach with a deep groan. \"Ay, ay,\" he said,\r\n\"the folk of Jarlshof, they will make clean wark; they are kend for that\r\nfar and wide; they winna leave the value of a rotten ratlin; and what's\r\nwaur, there isna ane o' them has mense or sense eneugh to give thanks\r\nfor the mercies when they have gotten them. There is the auld Ranzelman,\r\nNeil Ronaldson, that canna walk a mile to hear the minister, but he will\r\nhirple ten if he hears of a ship embayed.\"\r\n\r\nNorna, however, seemed to possess over him so complete an ascendency,\r\nthat he no longer hesitated to take the man, who now gave strong\r\nsymptoms of reviving existence, upon his shoulders; and, assisted by\r\nMordaunt, trudged along the sea-beach with his burden, without farther\r\nremonstrance. Ere he was borne off, the stranger pointed to the chest,\r\nand attempted to mutter something, to which Norna replied, \"Enough. It\r\nshall be secured.\"\r\n\r\nAdvancing towards the passage called Erick's Steps, by which they were\r\nto ascend the cliffs, they met the people from Jarlshof hastening in the\r\nopposite direction. Man and woman, as they passed, reverently made room\r\nfor Norna, and saluted her--not without an expression of fear upon some\r\nof their faces. She passed them a few paces, and then turning back,\r\ncalled aloud to the Ranzelman, who (though the practice was more common\r\nthan legal) was attending the rest of the hamlet upon this plundering\r\nexpedition. \"Neil Ronaldson,\" she said, \"mark my words. There stands\r\nyonder a chest, from which the lid has been just prized off. Look it be\r\nbrought down to your own house at Jarlshof, just as it now is. Beware of\r\nmoving or touching the slightest article. He were better in his grave\r\nthat so much as looks at the contents. I speak not for nought, nor in\r\naught will I be disobeyed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your pleasure shall be done, mother,\" said Ronaldson. \"I warrant we\r\nwill not break bulk, since sic is your bidding.\"\r\n\r\nFar behind the rest of the villagers, followed an old woman, talking to\r\nherself, and cursing her own decrepitude, which kept her the last of the\r\nparty, yet pressing forward with all her might to get her share of the\r\nspoil.\r\n\r\nWhen they met her, Mordaunt was astonished to recognise his father's old\r\nhousekeeper. \"How now,\" he said, \"Swertha, what make you so far from\r\nhome?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just e'en daikering out to look after my auld master and your honour,\"\r\nreplied Swertha, who felt like a criminal caught in the manner; for on\r\nmore occasions than one, Mr. Mertoun had intimated his high\r\ndisapprobation of such excursions as she was at present engaged in.\r\n\r\nBut Mordaunt was too much engaged with his own thoughts to take much\r\nnotice of her delinquency. \"Have you seen my father?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"And that I have,\" replied Swertha--\"The gude gentleman was ganging to\r\nhirsel himsell doun Erick's Steps, whilk would have been the ending of\r\nhim, that is in no way a cragsman. Sae I e'en gat him wiled away\r\nhame--and I was just seeking you that you may gang after him to the\r\nhall-house, for to my thought he is far frae weel.\"\r\n\r\n\"My father unwell?\" said Mordaunt, remembering the faintness he had\r\nexhibited at the commencement of that morning's walk.\r\n\r\n\"Far frae weel--far frae weel,\" groaned out Swertha, with a piteous\r\nshake of the head--\"white o' the gills--white o' the gills--and him to\r\nthink of coming down the riva!\"\r\n\r\n\"Return home, Mordaunt,\" said Norna, who was listening to what had\r\npassed. \"I will see all that is necessary done for this man's relief,\r\nand you will find him at the Ranzelman's, when you list to enquire. You\r\ncannot help him more than you already have done.\"\r\n\r\nMordaunt felt this was true, and, commanding Swertha to follow him\r\ninstantly, betook himself to the path homeward.\r\n\r\nSwertha hobbled reluctantly after her young master in the same\r\ndirection, until she lost sight of him on his entering the cleft of the\r\nrock; then instantly turned about, muttering to herself, \"Haste home, in\r\ngood sooth?--haste home, and lose the best chance of getting a new\r\nrokelay and owerlay that I have had these ten years? by my certie,\r\nna--It's seldom sic rich godsends come on our shore--no since the Jenny\r\nand James came ashore in King Charlie's time.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, she mended her pace as well as she could, and, a willing mind\r\nmaking amends for frail limbs, posted on with wonderful dispatch to put\r\nin for her share of the spoil. She soon reached the beach, where the\r\nRanzelman, stuffing his own pouches all the while, was exhorting the\r\nrest to part things fair, and be neighbourly, and to give to the auld\r\nand helpless a share of what was going, which, he charitably remarked,\r\nwould bring a blessing on the shore, and send them \"mair wrecks ere\r\nwinter.\"[32]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[30] Note III.--Sale of Winds.\r\n\r\n[31] Note IV.--Reluctance to Save Drowning Men.\r\n\r\n[32] Note V.--Mair Wrecks ere Winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n  He was a lovely youth, I guess;\r\n  The panther in the wilderness\r\n    Was not so fair as he;\r\n  And when he chose to sport and play,\r\n  No dolphin ever was so gay,\r\n    Upon the tropic sea.\r\n\r\n                                                 WORDSWORTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe light foot of Mordaunt Mertoun was not long of bearing him to\r\nJarlshof. He entered the house hastily, for what he himself had observed\r\nthat morning, corresponded in some degree with the ideas which Swertha's\r\ntale was calculated to excite. He found his father, however, in the\r\ninner apartment, reposing himself after his fatigue; and his first\r\nquestion satisfied him that the good dame had practised a little\r\nimposition to get rid of them both.\r\n\r\n\"Where is this dying man, whom you have so wisely ventured your own neck\r\nto relieve?\" said the elder Mertoun to the younger.\r\n\r\n\"Norna, sir,\" replied Mordaunt, \"has taken him under her charge; she\r\nunderstands such matters.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is quack as well as witch?\" said the elder Mertoun. \"With all my\r\nheart--it is a trouble saved. But I hasted home, on Swertha's hint, to\r\nlook out for lint and bandages; for her speech was of broken bones.\"\r\n\r\nMordaunt kept silence, well knowing his father would not persevere in\r\nhis enquiries upon such a matter, and not willing either to prejudice\r\nthe old governante, or to excite his father to one of those excesses of\r\npassion into which he was apt to burst, when, contrary to his wont, he\r\nthought proper to correct the conduct of his domestic.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the day ere old Swertha returned from her expedition,\r\nheartily fatigued, and bearing with her a bundle of some bulk,\r\ncontaining, it would seem, her share of the spoil. Mordaunt instantly\r\nsought her out, to charge her with the deceits she had practised on both\r\nhis father and himself; but the accused matron lacked not her reply.\r\n\r\n\"By her troth;\" she said, \"she thought it was time to bid Mr. Mertoun\r\ngang hame and get bandages, when she had seen, with her ain twa een,\r\nMordaunt ganging down the cliff like a wild-cat--it was to be thought\r\nbroken bones would be the end, and lucky if bandages wad do any\r\ngood;--and, by her troth, she might weel tell Mordaunt his father was\r\npuirly, and him looking sae white in the gills, (whilk, she wad die upon\r\nit, was the very word she used,) and it was a thing that couldna be\r\ndenied by man at this very moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Swertha,\" said Mordaunt, as soon as her clamorous defence gave him\r\ntime to speak in reply, \"how came you, that should have been busy with\r\nyour housewifery and your spinning, to be out this morning at Erick's\r\nSteps, in order to take all this unnecessary care of my father and\r\nme?--And what is in that bundle, Swertha? for I fear, Swertha, you have\r\nbeen transgressing the law, and have been out upon the wrecking system.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fair fa' your sonsy face, and the blessing of Saint Ronald upon you!\"\r\nsaid Swertha, in a tone betwixt coaxing and jesting; \"would you keep a\r\npuir body frae mending hersell, and sae muckle gear lying on the loose\r\nsand for the lifting?--Hout, Maister Mordaunt, a ship ashore is a sight\r\nto wile the minister out of his very pu'pit in the middle of his\r\npreaching, muckle mair a puir auld ignorant wife frae her rock and her\r\ntow. And little did I get for my day's wark--just some rags o' cambric\r\nthings, and a bit or twa of coorse claith, and sic like--the strong and\r\nthe hearty get a' thing in this warld.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Swertha,\" replied Mordaunt, \"and that is rather hard, as you must\r\nhave your share of punishment in this world and the next, for robbing\r\nthe poor mariners.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hout, callant, wha wad punish an auld wife like me for a wheen\r\nduds?--Folk speak muckle black ill of Earl Patrick; but he was a freend\r\nto the shore, and made wise laws against ony body helping vessels that\r\nwere like to gang on the breakers.[33]--And the mariners, I have heard\r\nBryce Jagger say, lose their right frae the time keel touches sand; and,\r\nmoreover, they are dead and gane, poor souls--dead and gane, and care\r\nlittle about warld's wealth now--Nay, nae mair than the great Jarls and\r\nSea-kings, in the Norse days, did about the treasures that they buried\r\nin the tombs and sepulchres auld langsyne. Did I ever tell you the sang,\r\nMaister Mordaunt, how Olaf Tryguarson garr'd hide five gold crowns in\r\nthe same grave with him?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Swertha,\" said Mordaunt, who took pleasure in tormenting the\r\ncunning old plunderer--\"you never told me that; but I tell you, that the\r\nstranger whom Norna has taken down to the town, will be well enough\r\nto-morrow, to ask where you have hidden the goods that you have stolen\r\nfrom the wreck.\"\r\n\r\n\"But wha will tell him a word about it, hinnie?\" said Swertha, looking\r\nslyly up in her young master's face--\"The mair by token, since I maun\r\ntell ye, that I have a bonny remnant of silk amang the lave, that will\r\nmake a dainty waistcoat to yoursell, the first merry-making ye gang to.\"\r\n\r\nMordaunt could no longer forbear laughing at the cunning with which the\r\nold dame proposed to bribe off his evidence by imparting a portion of\r\nher plunder; and, desiring her to get ready what provision she had made\r\nfor dinner, he returned to his father, whom he found still sitting in\r\nthe same place, and nearly in the same posture, in which he had left\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nWhen their hasty and frugal meal was finished, Mordaunt announced to his\r\nfather his purpose of going down to the town, or hamlet, to look after\r\nthe shipwrecked sailor.\r\n\r\nThe elder Mertoun assented with a nod.\r\n\r\n\"He must be ill accommodated there, sir,\" added his son,--a hint which\r\nonly produced another nod of assent. \"He seemed, from his appearance,\"\r\npursued Mordaunt, \"to be of very good rank--and admitting these poor\r\npeople do their best to receive him, in his present weak state, yet\"----\r\n\r\n\"I know what you would say,\" said his father, interrupting him; \"we, you\r\nthink, ought to do something towards assisting him. Go to him, then--if\r\nhe lacks money, let him name the sum, and he shall have it; but, for\r\nlodging the stranger here, and holding intercourse with him, I neither\r\ncan, nor will do so. I have retired to this farthest extremity of the\r\nBritish isles, to avoid new friends, and new faces, and none such shall\r\nintrude on me either their happiness or their misery. When you have\r\nknown the world half a score of years longer, your early friends will\r\nhave given you reason to remember them, and to avoid new ones for the\r\nrest of your life. Go then--why do you stop?--rid the country of the\r\nman--let me see no one about me but those vulgar countenances, the\r\nextent and character of whose petty knavery I know, and can submit to,\r\nas to an evil too trifling to cause irritation.\" He then threw his purse\r\nto his son, and signed to him to depart with all speed.\r\n\r\nMordaunt was not long before he reached the village. In the dark abode\r\nof Neil Ronaldson, the Ranzelman, he found the stranger seated by the\r\npeat-fire, upon the very chest which had excited the cupidity of the\r\ndevout Bryce Snailsfoot, the pedlar. The Ranzelman himself was absent,\r\ndividing, with all due impartiality, the spoils of the wrecked vessel\r\namongst the natives of the community; listening to and redressing their\r\ncomplaints of inequality; and (if the matter in hand had not been, from\r\nbeginning to end, utterly unjust and indefensible) discharging the part\r\nof a wise and prudent magistrate, in all the details. For at this time,\r\nand probably until a much later period, the lower orders of the\r\nislanders entertained an opinion, common to barbarians also in the same\r\nsituation, that whatever was cast on their shores, became their\r\nindisputable property.\r\n\r\nMargery Bimbister, the worthy spouse of the Ranzelman, was in the charge\r\nof the house, and introduced Mordaunt to her guest, saying, with no\r\ngreat ceremony, \"This is the young tacksman--You will maybe tell him\r\nyour name, though you will not tell it to us. If it had not been for\r\nhis four quarters, it's but little you would have said to any body, sae\r\nlang as life lasted.\"\r\n\r\nThe stranger arose, and shook Mordaunt by the hand; observing, he\r\nunderstood that he had been the means of saving his life and his chest.\r\n\"The rest of the property,\" he said, \"is, I see, walking the plank; for\r\nthey are as busy as the devil in a gale of wind.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what was the use of your seamanship, then,\" said Margery, \"that you\r\ncouldna keep off the Sumburgh-head? It would have been lang ere\r\nSumburgh-head had come to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave us for a moment, good Margery Bimbister,\" said Mordaunt; \"I wish\r\nto have some private conversation with this gentleman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentleman!\" said Margery, with an emphasis; \"not but the man is well\r\nenough to look at,\" she added, again surveying him, \"but I doubt if\r\nthere is muckle of the gentleman about him.\"\r\n\r\nMordaunt looked at the stranger, and was of a different opinion. He was\r\nrather above the middle size, and formed handsomely as well as strongly.\r\nMordaunt's intercourse with society was not extensive; but he thought\r\nhis new acquaintance, to a bold sunburnt handsome countenance, which\r\nseemed to have faced various climates, added the frank and open manners\r\nof a sailor. He answered cheerfully the enquiries which Mordaunt made\r\nafter his health; and maintained that one night's rest would relieve him\r\nfrom all the effects of the disaster he had sustained. But he spoke with\r\nbitterness of the avarice and curiosity of the Ranzelman and his spouse.\r\n\r\n\"That chattering old woman,\" said the stranger, \"has persecuted me the\r\nwhole day for the name of the ship. I think she might be contented with\r\nthe share she has had of it. I was the principal owner of the vessel\r\nthat was lost yonder, and they have left me nothing but my wearing\r\napparel. Is there no magistrate, or justice of the peace, in this wild\r\ncountry, that would lend a hand to help one when he is among the\r\nbreakers?\"\r\n\r\nMordaunt mentioned Magnus Troil, the principal proprietor, as well as\r\nthe Fowd, or provincial judge, of the district, as the person from whom\r\nhe was most likely to obtain redress; and regretted that his own youth,\r\nand his father's situation as a retired stranger, should put it out of\r\ntheir power to afford him the protection he required.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, for your part, you have done enough,\" said the sailor; \"but if I\r\nhad five out of the forty brave fellows that are fishes' food by this\r\ntime, the devil a man would I ask to do me the right that I could do for\r\nmyself!\"\r\n\r\n\"Forty hands!\" said Mordaunt; \"you were well manned for the size of the\r\nship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so well as we needed to be. We mounted ten guns, besides chasers;\r\nbut our cruise on the main had thinned us of men, and lumbered us up\r\nwith goods. Six of our guns were in ballast--Hands! if I had had enough\r\nof hands, we would never have miscarried so infernally. The people were\r\nknocked up with working the pumps, and so took to their boats, and left\r\nme with the vessel, to sink or swim. But the dogs had their pay, and I\r\ncan afford to pardon them--The boat swamped in the current--all were\r\nlost--and here am I.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had come north about then, from the West Indies?\" said Mordaunt.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay; the vessel was the Good Hope of Bristol, a letter of marque.\r\nShe had fine luck down on the Spanish main, both with commerce and\r\nprivateering, but the luck's ended with her now. My name is Clement\r\nCleveland, captain, and part owner, as I said before--I am a Bristol man\r\nborn--my father was well known on the Tollsell--old Clem Cleveland of\r\nthe College-green.\"\r\n\r\nMordaunt had no right to enquire farther, and yet it seemed to him as if\r\nhis own mind was but half satisfied. There was an affectation of\r\nbluntness, a sort of defiance, in the manner of the stranger, for which\r\ncircumstances afforded no occasion. Captain Cleveland had suffered\r\ninjustice from the islanders, but from Mordaunt he had only received\r\nkindness and protection; yet he seemed as if he involved all the\r\nneighbourhood in the wrongs he complained of. Mordaunt looked down and\r\nwas silent, doubting whether it would be better to take his leave, or to\r\nproceed farther in his offers of assistance. Cleveland seemed to guess\r\nat his thoughts, for he immediately added, in a conciliating manner,--\"I\r\nam a plain man, Master Mertoun, for that I understand is your name; and\r\nI am a ruined man to boot, and that does not mend one's good manners.\r\nBut you have done a kind and friendly part by me, and it may be I think\r\nas much of it as if I thanked you more. And so before I leave this\r\nplace, I'll give you my fowlingpiece; she will put a hundred swan-shot\r\nthrough a Dutchman's cap at eighty paces--she will carry ball too--I\r\nhave hit a wild bull within a hundred-and-fifty yards--but I have two\r\npieces that are as good, or better, so you may keep this for my sake.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be to take my share of the wreck,\" answered Mordaunt,\r\nlaughing.\r\n\r\n\"No such matter,\" said Cleveland, undoing a case which contained several\r\nguns and pistols,--\"you see I have saved my private arm-chest, as well\r\nas my clothes--_that_ the tall old woman in the dark rigging managed for\r\nme. And, between ourselves, it is worth all I have lost; for,\" he added,\r\nlowering his voice, and looking round, \"when I speak of being ruined in\r\nthe hearing of these landsharks, I do not mean ruined stock and block.\r\nNo, here is something will do more than shoot sea-fowl.\" So saying, he\r\npulled out a great ammunition-pouch marked swan-shot, and showed\r\nMordaunt, hastily, that it was full of Spanish pistoles and Portagues\r\n(as the broad Portugal pieces were then called.) \"No, no,\" he added,\r\nwith a smile, \"I have ballast enough to trim the vessel again; and now,\r\nwill you take the piece?\"\r\n\r\n\"Since you are willing to give it me,\" said Mordaunt, laughing, \"with\r\nall my heart. I was just going to ask you in my father's name,\" he\r\nadded, showing his purse, \"whether you wanted any of that same ballast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, but you see I am provided--take my old acquaintance, and may\r\nshe serve you as well as she has served me; but you will never make so\r\ngood a voyage with her. You can shoot, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Tolerably well,\" said Mordaunt, admiring the piece, which was a\r\nbeautiful Spanish-barrelled gun, inlaid with gold, small in the bore,\r\nand of unusual length, such as is chiefly used for shooting sea-fowl,\r\nand for ball-practice.\r\n\r\n\"With slugs,\" continued the donor, \"never gun shot closer; and with\r\nsingle ball, you may kill a seal two hundred yards at sea from the top\r\nof the highest peak of this iron-bound coast of yours. But I tell you\r\nagain, that the old rattler will never do you the service she has done\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not use her so dexterously, perhaps,\" said Mordaunt.\r\n\r\n\"Umph!--perhaps not,\" replied Cleveland; \"but that is not the question.\r\nWhat say you to shooting the man at the wheel, just as we run aboard of\r\na Spaniard? So the Don was taken aback, and we laid him athwart the\r\nhawse, and carried her cutlass in hand; and worth the while she\r\nwas--stout brigantine--El Santo Francisco--bound for Porto Bello, with\r\ngold and negroes. That little bit of lead was worth twenty thousand\r\npistoles.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have shot at no such game as yet,\" said Mordaunt.\r\n\r\n\"Well, all in good time; we cannot weigh till the tide makes. But you\r\nare a tight, handsome, active young man. What is to ail you to take a\r\ntrip after some of this stuff?\" laying his hand on the bag of gold.\r\n\r\n\"My father talks of my travelling soon,\" replied Mordaunt, who, born to\r\nhold men-of-wars-men in great respect, felt flattered by this invitation\r\nfrom one who appeared a thorough-bred seaman.\r\n\r\n\"I respect him for the thought,\" said the Captain; \"and I will visit him\r\nbefore I weigh anchor. I have a consort off these islands, and be cursed\r\nto her. She'll find me out somewhere, though she parted company in the\r\nbit of a squall, unless she is gone to Davy Jones too.--Well, she was\r\nbetter found than we, and not so deep loaded--she must have weathered\r\nit. We'll have a hammock slung for you aboard, and make a sailor and a\r\nman of you in the same trip.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like it well enough,\" said Mordaunt, who eagerly longed to\r\nsee more of the world than his lonely situation had hitherto permitted;\r\n\"but then my father must decide.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your father? pooh!\" said Captain Cleveland;--\"but you are very right,\"\r\nhe added, checking himself; \"Gad, I have lived so long at sea, that I\r\ncannot imagine any body has a right to think except the captain and the\r\nmaster. But you are very right. I will go up to the old gentleman this\r\ninstant, and speak to him myself. He lives in that handsome,\r\nmodern-looking building, I suppose, that I see a quarter of a mile off?\"\r\n\r\n\"In that old half-ruined house,\" said Mordaunt, \"he does indeed live;\r\nbut he will see no visitors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you must drive the point yourself, for I can't stay in this\r\nlatitude. Since your father is no magistrate, I must go to see this same\r\nMagnus--how call you him?--who is not justice of peace, but something\r\nelse that will do the turn as well. These fellows have got two or three\r\nthings that I must and will have back--let them keep the rest and be\r\nd----d to them. Will you give me a letter to him, just by way of\r\ncommission?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is scarce needful,\" said Mordaunt. \"It is enough that you are\r\nshipwrecked, and need his help;--but yet I may as well furnish you with\r\na letter of introduction.\"\r\n\r\n\"There,\" said the sailor, producing a writing-case from his chest, \"are\r\nyour writing-tools.--Meantime, since bulk has been broken, I will nail\r\ndown the hatches, and make sure of the cargo.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Mordaunt, accordingly, was engaged in writing to Magnus Troil a\r\nletter, setting forth the circumstances in which Captain Cleveland had\r\nbeen thrown upon their coast, the Captain, having first selected and\r\nlaid aside some wearing apparel and necessaries enough to fill a\r\nknapsack, took in hand hammer and nails, employed himself in securing\r\nthe lid of his sea-chest, by fastening it down in a workmanlike manner,\r\nand then added the corroborating security of a cord, twisted and knotted\r\nwith nautical dexterity. \"I leave this in your charge,\" he said, \"all\r\nexcept this,\" showing the bag of gold, \"and these,\" pointing to a\r\ncutlass and pistols, \"which may prevent all further risk of my parting\r\ncompany with my Portagues.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will find no occasion for weapons in this country, Captain\r\nCleveland,\" replied Mordaunt; \"a child might travel with a purse of gold\r\nfrom Sumburgh-head to the Scaw of Unst, and no soul would injure him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that's pretty boldly said, young gentleman, considering what is\r\ngoing on without doors at this moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"O,\" replied Mordaunt, a little confused, \"what comes on land with the\r\ntide, they reckon their lawful property. One would think they had\r\nstudied under Sir Arthegal, who pronounces--\r\n\r\n  'For equal right in equal things doth stand,\r\n    And what the mighty sea hath once possess'd,\r\n  And plucked quite from all possessors' hands,\r\n    Or else by wrecks that wretches have distress'd,\r\n  He may dispose, by his resistless might,\r\n    As things at random left, to whom he list.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall think the better of plays and ballads as long as I live, for\r\nthese very words,\" said Captain Cleveland; \"and yet I have loved them\r\nwell enough in my day. But this is good doctrine, and more men than one\r\nmay trim their sails to such a breeze. What the sea sends is ours,\r\nthat's sure enough. However, in case that your good folks should think\r\nthe land as well as the sea may present them with waiffs and strays, I\r\nwill make bold to take my cutlass and pistols.--Will you cause my chest\r\nto be secured in your own house till you hear from me, and use your\r\ninfluence to procure me a guide to show me the way, and to carry my\r\nkit?\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you go by sea or land?\" said Mordaunt, in reply.\r\n\r\n\"By sea!\" exclaimed Cleveland. \"What--in one of these cockleshells, and\r\na cracked cockleshell, to boot? No, no--land, land, unless I knew my\r\ncrew, my vessel, and my voyage.\"\r\n\r\nThey parted accordingly, Captain Cleveland being supplied with a guide\r\nto conduct him to Burgh-Westra, and his chest being carefully removed to\r\nthe mansion-house at Jarlshof.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[33] This was literally true.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n  This is a gentle trader, and a prudent.\r\n  He's no Autolycus, to blear your eye,\r\n  With quips of worldly gauds and gamesomeness;\r\n  But seasons all his glittering merchandise\r\n  With wholesome doctrines, suited to the use,\r\n  As men sauce goose with sage and rosemary.\r\n\r\n                                                 _Old Play._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the subsequent morning, Mordaunt, in answer to his father's\r\nenquiries, began to give him some account of the shipwrecked mariner,\r\nwhom he had rescued from the waves. But he had not proceeded far in\r\nrecapitulating the particulars which Cleveland had communicated, when\r\nMr. Mertoun's looks became disturbed--he arose hastily, and, after\r\npacing twice or thrice across the room, he retired into the inner\r\nchamber, to which he usually confined himself, while under the influence\r\nof his mental malady. In the evening he re-appeared, without any traces\r\nof his disorder; but it may be easily supposed that his son avoided\r\nrecurring to the subject which had affected him.\r\n\r\nMordaunt Mertoun was thus left without assistance, to form at his\r\nleisure his own opinion respecting the new acquaintance which the sea\r\nhad sent him; and, upon the whole, he was himself surprised to find the\r\nresult less favourable to the stranger than he could well account for.\r\nThere seemed to Mordaunt to be a sort of repelling influence about the\r\nman. True, he was a handsome man, of a frank and prepossessing manner,\r\nbut there was an assumption of superiority about him, which Mordaunt did\r\nnot quite so much like. Although he was so keen a sportsman as to be\r\ndelighted with his acquisition of the Spanish-barrelled gun, and\r\naccordingly mounted and dismounted it with great interest, paying the\r\nutmost attention to the most minute parts about the lock and ornaments,\r\nyet he was, upon the whole, inclined to have some scruples about the\r\nmode in which he had acquired it.\r\n\r\n\"I should not have accepted it,\" he thought; \"perhaps Captain Cleveland\r\nmight give it me as a sort of payment for the trifling service I did\r\nhim; and yet it would have been churlish to refuse it in the way it was\r\noffered. I wish he had looked more like a man whom one would have chosen\r\nto be obliged to.\"\r\n\r\nBut a successful day's shooting reconciled him to his gun, and he became\r\nassured, like most young sportsmen in similar circumstances, that all\r\nother pieces were but pop-guns in comparison. But then, to be doomed to\r\nshoot gulls and seals, when there were Frenchmen and Spaniards to be\r\ncome at--when there were ships to be boarded, and steersmen to be marked\r\noff, seemed but a dull and contemptible destiny. His father had\r\nmentioned his leaving these islands, and no other mode of occupation\r\noccurred to his inexperience, save that of the sea, with which he had\r\nbeen conversant from his infancy. His ambition had formerly aimed no\r\nhigher than at sharing the fatigues and dangers of a Greenland fishing\r\nexpedition; for it was in that scene that the Zetlanders laid most of\r\ntheir perilous adventures. But war was again raging, the history of Sir\r\nFrancis Drake, Captain Morgan, and other bold adventurers, an account of\r\nwhose exploits he had purchased from Bryce Snailsfoot, had made much\r\nimpression on his mind, and the offer of Captain Cleveland to take him\r\nto sea, frequently recurred to him, although the pleasure of such a\r\nproject was somewhat damped by a doubt, whether, in the long run, he\r\nshould not find many objections to his proposed commander. Thus much he\r\nalready saw, that he was opinionative, and might probably prove\r\narbitrary; and that, since even his kindness was mingled with an\r\nassumption of superiority, his occasional displeasure might contain a\r\ngreat deal more of that disagreeable ingredient than could be palatable\r\nto those who sailed under him. And yet, after counting all risks, could\r\nhis father's consent be obtained, with what pleasure, he thought, would\r\nhe embark in quest of new scenes and strange adventures, in which he\r\nproposed to himself to achieve such deeds as should be the theme of many\r\na tale to the lovely sisters of Burgh-Westra--tales at which Minna\r\nshould weep, and Brenda should smile, and both should marvel! And this\r\nwas to be the reward of his labours and his dangers; for the hearth of\r\nMagnus Troil had a magnetic influence over his thoughts, and however\r\nthey might traverse amid his day-dreams, it was the point where they\r\nfinally settled.\r\n\r\nThere were times when Mordaunt thought of mentioning to his father the\r\nconversation he had held with Captain Cleveland, and the seaman's\r\nproposal to him; but the very short and general account which he had\r\ngiven of that person's history, upon the morning after his departure\r\nfrom the hamlet, had produced a sinister effect on Mr. Mertoun's mind,\r\nand discouraged him from speaking farther on any subject connected with\r\nit. It would be time enough, he thought, to mention Captain Cleveland's\r\nproposal, when his consort should arrive, and when he should repeat his\r\noffer in a more formal manner; and these he supposed events likely very\r\nsoon to happen.\r\n\r\nBut days grew to weeks, and weeks were numbered into months, and he\r\nheard nothing from Cleveland; and only learned by an occasional visit\r\nfrom Bryce Snailsfoot, that the Captain was residing at Burgh-Westra, as\r\none of the family. Mordaunt was somewhat surprised at this, although the\r\nunlimited hospitality of the islands, which Magnus Troil, both from\r\nfortune and disposition, carried to the utmost extent, made it almost a\r\nmatter of course that he should remain in the family until he disposed\r\nof himself otherwise. Still it seemed strange he had not gone to some of\r\nthe northern isles to enquire after his consort; or that he did not\r\nrather choose to make Lerwick his residence, where fishing vessels often\r\nbrought news from the coasts and ports of Scotland and Holland. Again,\r\nwhy did he not send for the chest he had deposited at Jarlshof? and\r\nstill farther, Mordaunt thought it would have been but polite if the\r\nstranger had sent him some sort of message in token of remembrance.\r\n\r\nThese subjects of reflection were connected with another still more\r\nunpleasant, and more difficult to account for. Until the arrival of this\r\nperson, scarce a week had passed without bringing him some kind\r\ngreeting, or token of recollection, from Burgh-Westra; and pretences\r\nwere scarce ever wanting for maintaining a constant intercourse. Minna\r\nwanted the words of a Norse ballad; or desired to have, for her various\r\ncollections, feathers, or eggs, or shells, or specimens of the rarer\r\nsea-weeds; or Brenda sent a riddle to be resolved, or a song to be\r\nlearned; or the honest old Udaller,--in a rude manuscript, which might\r\nhave passed for an ancient Runic inscription,--sent his hearty greetings\r\nto his good young friend, with a present of something to make good\r\ncheer, and an earnest request he would come to Burgh-Westra as soon, and\r\nstay there as long, as possible. These kindly tokens of remembrance were\r\noften sent by special message; besides which, there was never a\r\npassenger or a traveller, who crossed from the one mansion to the other,\r\nwho did not bring to Mordaunt some friendly greeting from the Udaller\r\nand his family. Of late, this intercourse had become more and more\r\ninfrequent; and no messenger from Burgh-Westra had visited Jarlshof for\r\nseveral weeks. Mordaunt both observed and felt this alteration, and it\r\ndwelt on his mind, while he questioned Bryce as closely as pride and\r\nprudence would permit, to ascertain, if possible, the cause of the\r\nchange. Yet he endeavoured to assume an indifferent air while he asked\r\nthe jagger whether there were no news in the country.\r\n\r\n\"Great news,\" the jagger replied; \"and a gay mony of them. That\r\ncrackbrained carle, the new factor, is for making a change in the\r\n_bismars_ and the _lispunds_;[34] and our worthy Fowd, Magnus Troil, has\r\nsworn, that, sooner than change them for the still-yard, or aught else,\r\nhe'll fling Factor Yellowley from Brassa-craig.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\" said Mordaunt, very little interested.\r\n\r\n\"All? and eneugh, I think,\" replied the pedlar. \"How are folks to buy\r\nand sell, if the weights are changed on them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true,\" replied Mordaunt; \"but have you heard of no strange vessels\r\non the coast?\"\r\n\r\n\"Six Dutch doggers off Brassa; and, as I hear, a high-quartered galliot\r\nthing, with a gaff mainsail, lying in Scalloway Bay. She will be from\r\nNorway.\"\r\n\r\n\"No ships of war, or sloops?\"\r\n\r\n\"None,\" replied the pedlar, \"since the Kite Tender sailed with the\r\nimpress men. If it was His will, and our men were out of her, I wish the\r\ndeep sea had her!\"\r\n\r\n\"Were there no news at Burgh-Westra?--Were the family all well?\"\r\n\r\n\"A' weel, and weel to do--out-taken, it may be, something ower muckle\r\ndaffing and laughing--dancing ilk night, they say, wi' the stranger\r\ncaptain that's living there--him that was ashore on Sumburgh-head the\r\ntother day,--less daffing served him then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Daffing! dancing every night!\" said Mordaunt, not particularly well\r\nsatisfied--\"Whom does Captain Cleveland dance with?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ony body he likes, I fancy,\" said the jagger; \"at ony rate, he gars a'\r\nbody yonder dance after his fiddle. But I ken little about it, for I am\r\nno free in conscience to look upon thae flinging fancies. Folk should\r\nmind that life is made but of rotten yarn.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fancy that it is to keep them in mind of that wholesome truth, that\r\nyou deal in such tender wares, Bryce,\" replied Mordaunt, dissatisfied as\r\nwell with the tenor of the reply, as with the affected scruples of the\r\nrespondent.\r\n\r\n\"That's as muckle as to say, that I suld hae minded you was a flinger\r\nand a fiddler yoursell, Maister Mordaunt; but I am an auld man, and maun\r\nunburden my conscience. But ye will be for the dance, I sall warrant,\r\nthat's to be at Burgh-Westra, on John's Even, (_Saunt_ John's, as the\r\nblinded creatures ca' him,) and nae doubt ye will be for some warldly\r\nbraws--hose, waistcoats, or sic like? I hae pieces frae Flanders.\"--With\r\nthat he placed his movable warehouse on the table, and began to unlock\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"Dance!\" repeated Mordaunt--\"Dance on St. John's Even?--Were you desired\r\nto bid me to it, Bryce?\"\r\n\r\n\"Na--but ye ken weel eneugh ye wad be welcome, bidden or no bidden. This\r\ncaptain--how ca' ye him?--is to be skudler, as they ca't--the first of\r\nthe gang, like.\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil take him!\" said Mordaunt, in impatient surprise.\r\n\r\n\"A' in gude time,\" replied the jagger; \"hurry no man's cattle--the devil\r\nwill hae his due, I warrant ye, or it winna be for lack of seeking. But\r\nit's true I'm telling you, for a' ye stare like a wild-cat; and this\r\nsame captain,--I watna his name,--bought ane of the very waistcoats that\r\nI am ganging to show ye--purple, wi' a gowd binding, and bonnily\r\nbroidered; and I have a piece for you, the neighbour of it, wi' a green\r\ngrund; and if ye mean to streek yoursell up beside him, ye maun e'en buy\r\nit, for it's gowd that glances in the lasses' een now-a-days. See--look\r\ntill't,\" he added, displaying the pattern in various points of view;\r\n\"look till _it_ through the light, and till the light through\r\n_it_--_wi'_ the grain, and _against_ the grain--it shows ony gate--cam\r\nfrae Antwerp a' the gate--four dollars is the price; and yon captain was\r\nsae weel pleased that he flang down a twenty shilling Jacobus, and bade\r\nme keep the change and be d----d!--poor silly profane creature, I pity\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nWithout enquiring whether the pedlar bestowed his compassion on the\r\nworldly imprudence or the religious deficiencies of Captain Cleveland,\r\nMordaunt turned from him, folded his arms, and paced the apartment,\r\nmuttering to himself, \"Not asked--A stranger to be king of the\r\nfeast!\"--Words which he repeated so earnestly, that Bryce caught a part\r\nof their import.\r\n\r\n\"As for asking, I am almaist bauld to say, that ye will be asked,\r\nMaister Mordaunt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did they mention my name, then?\" said Mordaunt.\r\n\r\n\"I canna preceesely say that,\" said Bryce Snailsfoot;--\"but ye needna\r\nturn away your head sae sourly, like a sealgh when he leaves the shore;\r\nfor, do you see, I heard distinctly that a' the revellers about are to\r\nbe there; and is't to be thought they would leave out you, an auld kend\r\nfreend, and the lightest foot at sic frolics (Heaven send you a better\r\npraise in His ain gude time!) that ever flang at a fiddle-squeak,\r\nbetween this and Unst? Sae I consider ye altogether the same as\r\ninvited--and ye had best provide yourself wi' a waistcoat, for brave and\r\nbrisk will every man be that's there--the Lord pity them!\"\r\n\r\nHe thus continued to follow with his green glazen eyes the motions of\r\nyoung Mordaunt Mertoun, who was pacing the room in a very pensive\r\nmanner, which the jagger probably misinterpreted, as he thought, like\r\nClaudio, that if a man is sad, it must needs be because he lacks money.\r\nBryce, therefore, after another pause, thus accosted him. \"Ye needna be\r\nsad about the matter, Maister Mordaunt; for although I got the just\r\nprice of the article from the captain-man, yet I maun deal freendly wi'\r\nyou, as a kend freend and customer, and bring the price, as they say,\r\nwithin your purse-mouth--or it's the same to me to let it lie ower till\r\nMartinmas, or e'en to Candlemas. I am decent in the warld, Maister\r\nMordaunt--forbid that I should hurry ony body, far mair a freend that\r\nhas paid me siller afore now. Or I wad be content to swap the garment\r\nfor the value in feathers or sea-otters' skins, or ony kind of\r\npeltrie--nane kens better than yoursell how to come by sic ware--and I\r\nam sure I hae furnished you wi' the primest o' powder. I dinna ken if I\r\ntell'd ye it was out o' the kist of Captain Plunket, that perished on\r\nthe Scaw of Unst, wi' the armed brig Mary, sax years syne. He was a\r\nprime fowler himself, and luck it was that the kist came ashore dry. I\r\nsell that to nane but gude marksmen. And so, I was saying, if ye had ony\r\nwares ye liked to coup[35] for the waistcoat, I wad be ready to trock\r\nwi' you, for assuredly ye will be wanted at Burgh-Westra, on Saint\r\nJohn's Even; and ye wadna like to look waur than the Captain--that wadna\r\nbe setting.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will be there at least, whether wanted or not,\" said Mordaunt,\r\nstopping short in his walk, and taking the waistcoat-piece hastily out\r\nof the pedlar's hand; \"and, as you say, will not disgrace them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Haud a care--haud a care, Maister Mordaunt,\" exclaimed the pedlar; \"ye\r\nhandle it as it were a bale of coarse wadmaal--ye'll fray't to bits--ye\r\nmight weel say my ware is tender--and ye'll mind the price is four\r\ndollars--Sall I put ye in my book for it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Mordaunt, hastily; and, taking out his purse, he flung down\r\nthe money.\r\n\r\n\"Grace to ye to wear the garment,\" said the joyous pedlar, \"and to me\r\nto guide the siller; and protect us from earthly vanities, and earthly\r\ncovetousness; and send you the white linen raiment, whilk is mair to be\r\ndesired than the muslins, and cambrics, and lawns, and silks of this\r\nworld; and send me the talents which avail more than much fine Spanish\r\ngold, or Dutch dollars either--and--but God guide the callant, what for\r\nis he wrapping the silk up that gate, like a wisp of hay?\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment, old Swertha the housekeeper entered, to whom, as if\r\neager to get rid of the subject, Mordaunt threw his purchase, with\r\nsomething like careless disdain; and, telling her to put it aside,\r\nsnatched his gun, which stood in the corner, threw his shooting\r\naccoutrements about him, and, without noticing Bryce's attempt to enter\r\ninto conversation upon the \"braw seal-skin, as saft as doe-leather,\"\r\nwhich made the sling and cover of his fowlingpiece, he left the\r\napartment abruptly.\r\n\r\nThe jagger, with those green, goggling, and gain-descrying kind of\r\noptics, which we have already described, continued gazing for an instant\r\nafter the customer, who treated his wares with such irreverence.\r\n\r\nSwertha also looked after him with some surprise. \"The callant's in a\r\ncreel,\" quoth she.\r\n\r\n\"In a creel!\" echoed the pedlar; \"he will be as wowf as ever his father\r\nwas. To guide in that gate a bargain that cost him four dollars!--very,\r\nvery Fifish, as the east-country fisher-folk say.\"\r\n\r\n\"Four dollars for that green rag!\" said Swertha, catching at the words\r\nwhich the jagger had unwarily suffered to escape--\"that was a bargain\r\nindeed! I wonder whether he is the greater fule, or you the mair rogue,\r\nBryce Snailsfoot.\"\r\n\r\n\"I didna say it cost him preceesely four dollars,\" said Snailsfoot; \"but\r\nif it had, the lad's siller's his ain, I hope; and he is auld eneugh to\r\nmake his ain bargains. Mair by token the gudes are weel worth the money,\r\nand mair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mair by token,\" said Swertha, coolly, \"I will see what his father\r\nthinks about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye'll no be sae ill-natured, Mrs. Swertha,\" said the jagger; \"that will\r\nbe but cauld thanks for the bonny owerlay that I hae brought you a' the\r\nway frae Lerwick.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a bonny price ye'll be setting on't,\" said Swertha; \"for that's the\r\ngate your good deeds end.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye sall hae the fixing of the price yoursell; or it may lie ower till\r\nye're buying something for the house, or for your master, and it can\r\nmake a' ae count.\"\r\n\r\n\"Troth, and that's true, Bryce Snailsfoot, I am thinking we'll want some\r\nnapery sune--for it's no to be thought we can spin, and the like, as if\r\nthere was a mistress in the house; and sae we make nane at hame.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that's what I ca' walking by the word,\" said the jagger. \"'Go unto\r\nthose that buy and sell;' there's muckle profit in that text.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is a pleasure in dealing wi' a discreet man, that can make profit\r\nof ony thing,\" said Swertha; \"and now that I take another look at that\r\ndaft callant's waistcoat piece, I think it _is_ honestly worth four\r\ndollars.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[34] These are weights of Norwegian origin, still used in Zetland.\r\n\r\n[35] Barter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n    I have possessed the regulation of the weather and the\r\n    distribution of the seasons. The sun has listened to my\r\n    dictates, and passed from tropic to tropic by my direction;\r\n    the clouds, at my command, have poured forth their waters.\r\n\r\n                                                   RASSELAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nAny sudden cause for anxious and mortifying reflection, which, in\r\nadvanced age, occasions sullen and pensive inactivity, stimulates youth\r\nto eager and active exertion; as if, like the hurt deer, they\r\nendeavoured to drown the pain of the shaft by the rapidity of motion.\r\nWhen Mordaunt caught up his gun, and rushed out of the house of\r\nJarlshof, he walked on with great activity over waste and wild, without\r\nany determined purpose, except that of escaping, if possible, from the\r\nsmart of his own irritation. His pride was effectually mortified by the\r\nreport of the jagger, which coincided exactly with some doubts he had\r\nbeen led to entertain, by the long and unkind silence of his friends at\r\nBurgh-Westra.\r\n\r\nIf the fortunes of Cæsar had doomed him, as the poet suggests, to have\r\nbeen\r\n\r\n  \"But the best wrestler on the green,\"\r\n\r\nit is nevertheless to be presumed, that a foil from a rival, in that\r\nrustic exercise, would have mortified him as much as a defeat from a\r\ncompetitor, when he was struggling for the empery of the world. And even\r\nso Mordaunt Mertoun, degraded in his own eyes from the height which he\r\nhad occupied as the chief amongst the youth of the island, felt vexed\r\nand irritated, as well as humbled. The two beautiful sisters, also,\r\nwhose smiles all were so desirous of acquiring, with whom he had lived\r\non terms of such familiar affection, that, with the same ease and\r\ninnocence, there was unconsciously mixed a shade of deeper though\r\nundefined tenderness than characterises fraternal love,--they also\r\nseemed to have forgotten him. He could not be ignorant, that, in the\r\nuniversal opinion of all Dunrossness, nay, of the whole Mainland, he\r\nmight have had every chance of being the favoured lover of either; and\r\nnow at once, and without any failure on his part, he was become so\r\nlittle to them, that he had lost even the consequence of an ordinary\r\nacquaintance. The old Udaller, too, whose hearty and sincere character\r\nshould have made him more constant in his friendships, seemed to have\r\nbeen as fickle as his daughters, and poor Mordaunt had at once lost the\r\nsmiles of the fair, and the favour of the powerful. These were\r\nuncomfortable reflections, and he doubled his pace, that he might\r\noutstrip them if possible.\r\n\r\nWithout exactly reflecting upon the route which he pursued, Mordaunt\r\nwalked briskly on through a country where neither hedge, wall, nor\r\nenclosure of any kind, interrupts the steps of the wanderer, until he\r\nreached a very solitary spot, where, embosomed among steep heathy hills,\r\nwhich sunk suddenly down on the verge of the water, lay one of those\r\nsmall fresh-water lakes which are common in the Zetland isles, whose\r\noutlets form the sources of the small brooks and rivulets by which the\r\ncountry is watered, and serve to drive the little mills which\r\nmanufacture their grain.\r\n\r\nIt was a mild summer day; the beams of the sun, as is not uncommon in\r\nZetland, were moderated and shaded by a silvery haze, which filled the\r\natmosphere, and destroying the strong contrast of light and shade, gave\r\neven to noon the sober livery of the evening twilight. The little lake,\r\nnot three-quarters of a mile in circuit, lay in profound quiet; its\r\nsurface undimpled, save when one of the numerous water-fowl, which\r\nglided on its surface, dived for an instant under it. The depth of the\r\nwater gave the whole that cerulean tint of bluish green, which\r\noccasioned its being called the Green Loch; and at present, it formed so\r\nperfect a mirror to the bleak hills by which it was surrounded, and\r\nwhich lay reflected on its bosom, that it was difficult to distinguish\r\nthe water from the land; nay, in the shadowy uncertainty occasioned by\r\nthe thin haze, a stranger could scarce have been sensible that a sheet\r\nof water lay before him. A scene of more complete solitude, having all\r\nits peculiarities heightened by the extreme serenity of the weather, the\r\nquiet grey composed tone of the atmosphere, and the perfect silence of\r\nthe elements, could hardly be imagined. The very aquatic birds, who\r\nfrequented the spot in great numbers, forbore their usual flight and\r\nscreams, and floated in profound tranquillity upon the silent water.\r\n\r\nWithout taking any determined aim--without having any determined\r\npurpose--without almost thinking what he was about, Mordaunt presented\r\nhis fowlingpiece, and fired across the lake. The large swan shot dimpled\r\nits surface like a partial shower of hail--the hills took up the noise\r\nof the report, and repeated it again, and again, and again, to all their\r\nechoes; the water-fowl took to wing in eddying and confused wheel,\r\nanswering the echoes with a thousand varying screams, from the deep note\r\nof the swabie, or swartback, to the querulous cry of the tirracke and\r\nkittiewake.\r\n\r\nMordaunt looked for a moment on the clamorous crowd with a feeling of\r\nresentment, which he felt disposed at the moment to apply to all nature,\r\nand all her objects, animate or inanimate, however little concerned with\r\nthe cause of his internal mortification.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay,\" he said, \"wheel, dive, scream, and clamour as you will, and\r\nall because you have seen a strange sight, and heard an unusual sound.\r\nThere is many a one like you in this round world. But you, at least,\r\nshall learn,\" he added, as he reloaded his gun, \"that strange sights and\r\nstrange sounds, ay, and strange acquaintances to boot, have sometimes a\r\nlittle shade of danger connected with them.--But why should I wreak my\r\nown vexation on these harmless sea-gulls?\" he subjoined, after a\r\nmoment's pause; \"they have nothing to do with the friends that have\r\nforgotten me.--I loved them all so well,--and to be so soon given up for\r\nthe first stranger whom chance threw on the coast!\"\r\n\r\nAs he stood resting upon his gun, and abandoning his mind to the course\r\nof these unpleasant reflections, his meditations were unexpectedly\r\ninterrupted by some one touching his shoulder. He looked around, and saw\r\nNorna of the Fitful-head, wrapped in her dark and ample mantle. She had\r\nseen him from the brow of the hill, and had descended to the lake,\r\nthrough a small ravine which concealed her, until she came with\r\nnoiseless step so close to him that he turned round at her touch.\r\n\r\nMordaunt Mertoun was by nature neither timorous nor credulous, and a\r\ncourse of reading more extensive than usual had, in some degree,\r\nfortified his mind against the attacks of superstition; but he would\r\nhave been an actual prodigy, if, living in Zetland in the end of the\r\nseventeenth century, he had possessed the philosophy which did not exist\r\nin Scotland generally, until at least two generations later. He doubted\r\nin his own mind the extent, nay, the very existence, of Norna's\r\nsupernatural attributes, which was a high flight of incredulity in the\r\ncountry where they were universally received; but still his incredulity\r\nwent no farther than doubts. She was unquestionably an extraordinary\r\nwoman, gifted with an energy above others, acting upon motives peculiar\r\nto herself, and apparently independent of mere earthly considerations.\r\nImpressed with these ideas, which he had imbibed from his youth, it was\r\nnot without something like alarm, that he beheld this mysterious female\r\nstanding on a sudden so close beside him, and looking upon him with such\r\nsad and severe eyes, as those with which the Fatal Virgins, who,\r\naccording to northern mythology, were called the _Valkyriur_, or\r\n\"Choosers of the Slain,\" were supposed to regard the young champions\r\nwhom they selected to share the banquet of Odin.\r\n\r\nIt was, indeed, reckoned unlucky, to say the least, to meet with Norna\r\nsuddenly alone, and in a place remote from witnesses; and she was\r\nsupposed, on such occasions, to have been usually a prophetess of evil,\r\nas well as an omen of misfortune, to those who had such a rencontre.\r\nThere were few or none of the islanders, however familiarized with her\r\noccasional appearance in society, that would not have trembled to meet\r\nher on the solitary banks of the Green Loch.\r\n\r\n\"I bring you no evil, Mordaunt Mertoun,\" she said, reading perhaps\r\nsomething of this superstitious feeling in the looks of the young man.\r\n\"Evil from me you never felt, and never will.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor do I fear any,\" said Mordaunt, exerting himself to throw aside an\r\napprehension which he felt to be unmanly. \"Why should I, mother? You\r\nhave been ever my friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yet, Mordaunt, thou art not of our region; but to none of Zetland\r\nblood, no, not even to those who sit around the hearth-stone of Magnus\r\nTroil, the noble descendants of the ancient Jarls of Orkney, am I more a\r\nwell-wisher, than I am to thee, thou kind and brave-hearted boy. When I\r\nhung around thy neck that gifted chain, which all in our isles know was\r\nwrought by no earthly artist, but by the Drows,[36] in the secret\r\nrecesses of their caverns, thou wert then but fifteen years old; yet thy\r\nfoot had been on the Maiden-skerrie of Northmaven, known before but to\r\nthe webbed sole of the swartback, and thy skiff had been in the deepest\r\ncavern of Brinnastir, where the _haaf-fish_[37] had before slumbered in\r\ndark obscurity. Therefore I gave thee that noble gift; and well thou\r\nknowest, that since that day, every eye in these isles has looked on\r\nthee as a son, or as a brother, endowed beyond other youths, and the\r\nfavoured of those whose hour of power is when the night meets with the\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! mother,\" said Mordaunt, \"your kind gift may have given me favour,\r\nbut it has not been able to keep it for me, or I have not been able to\r\nkeep it for myself.--What matters it? I shall learn to set as little by\r\nothers as they do by me. My father says that I shall soon leave these\r\nislands, and therefore, Mother Norna, I will return to you your fairy\r\ngift, that it may bring more lasting luck to some other than it has done\r\nto me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Despise not the gift of the nameless race,\" said Norna, frowning; then\r\nsuddenly changing her tone of displeasure to that of mournful solemnity,\r\nshe added,--\"Despise them not, but, O Mordaunt, court them not! Sit down\r\non that grey stone--thou art the son of my adoption, and I will doff, as\r\nfar as I may, those attributes that sever me from the common mass of\r\nhumanity, and speak with you as a parent with a child.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a tremulous tone of grief which mingled with the loftiness of\r\nher language and carriage, and was calculated to excite sympathy, as\r\nwell as to attract attention. Mordaunt sat down on the rock which she\r\npointed out, a fragment which, with many others that lay scattered\r\naround, had been torn by some winter storm from the precipice at the\r\nfoot of which it lay, upon the very verge of the water. Norna took her\r\nown seat on a stone at about three feet distance, adjusted her mantle so\r\nthat little more than her forehead, her eyes, and a single lock of her\r\ngrey hair, were seen from beneath the shade of her dark wadmaal cloak,\r\nand then proceeded in a tone in which the imaginary consequence and\r\nimportance so often assumed by lunacy, seemed to contend against the\r\ndeep workings of some extraordinary and deeply-rooted mental affliction.\r\n\r\n\"I was not always,\" she said, \"that which I now am. I was not always the\r\nwise, the powerful, the commanding, before whom the young stand abashed,\r\nand the old uncover their grey heads. There was a time when my\r\nappearance did not silence mirth, when I sympathized with human passion,\r\nand had my own share in human joy or sorrow. It was a time of\r\nhelplessness--it was a time of folly--it was a time of idle and\r\nunfruitful laughter--it was a time of causeless and senseless\r\ntears;--and yet, with its follies, and its sorrows, and its weaknesses,\r\nwhat would Norna of Fitful-head give to be again the unmarked and happy\r\nmaiden that she was in her early days! Hear me, Mordaunt, and bear with\r\nme; for you hear me utter complaints which have never sounded in mortal\r\nears, and which in mortal ears shall never sound again. I will be what I\r\nought,\" she continued, starting up and extending her lean and withered\r\narm, \"the queen and protectress of these wild and neglected isles,--I\r\nwill be her whose foot the wave wets not, save by her permission; ay,\r\neven though its rage be at its wildest madness--whose robe the whirlwind\r\nrespects, when it rends the house-rigging from the roof-tree. Bear me\r\nwitness, Mordaunt Mertoun,--you heard my words at Harfra--you saw the\r\ntempest sink before them--Speak, bear me witness!\"\r\n\r\nTo have contradicted her in this strain of high-toned enthusiasm, would\r\nhave been cruel and unavailing, even had Mordaunt been more decidedly\r\nconvinced than he was, that an insane woman, not one of supernatural\r\npower, stood before him.\r\n\r\n\"I heard you sing,\" he replied, \"and I saw the tempest abate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Abate?\" exclaimed Norna, striking the ground impatiently with her staff\r\nof black oak; \"thou speakest it but half--it sunk at once--sunk in\r\nshorter space than the child that is hushed to silence by the\r\nnurse.--Enough, you know my power--but you know not--mortal man knows\r\nnot, and never shall know, the price which I paid to attain it. No,\r\nMordaunt, never for the widest sway that the ancient Norsemen boasted,\r\nwhen their banners waved victorious from Bergen to Palestine--never, for\r\nall that the round world contains, do thou barter thy peace of mind for\r\nsuch greatness as Norna's.\" She resumed her seat upon the rock, drew the\r\nmantle over her face, rested her head upon her hands, and by the\r\nconvulsive motion which agitated her bosom, appeared to be weeping\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\n\"Good Norna,\" said Mordaunt, and paused, scarce knowing what to say that\r\nmight console the unhappy woman--\"Good Norna,\" he again resumed, \"if\r\nthere be aught in your mind that troubles it, were you not best to go to\r\nthe worthy minister at Dunrossness? Men say you have not for many years\r\nbeen in a Christian congregation--that cannot be well, or right. You are\r\nyourself well known as a healer of bodily disease; but when the mind is\r\nsick, we should draw to the Physician of our souls.\"\r\n\r\nNorna had raised her person slowly from the stooping posture in which\r\nshe sat; but at length she started up on her feet, threw back her\r\nmantle, extended her arm, and while her lip foamed, and her eye\r\nsparkled, exclaimed in a tone resembling a scream,--\"Me did you\r\nspeak--me did you bid seek out a priest!--would you kill the good man\r\nwith horror?--Me in a Christian congregation!--Would you have the roof\r\nto fall on the sackless assembly, and mingle their blood with their\r\nworship? I--I seek to the good Physician!--Would you have the fiend\r\nclaim his prey openly before God and man?\"\r\n\r\nThe extreme agitation of the unhappy speaker naturally led Mordaunt to\r\nthe conclusion, which was generally adopted and accredited in that\r\nsuperstitious country and period. \"Wretched woman,\" he said, \"if indeed\r\nthou hast leagued thyself with the Powers of Evil, why should you not\r\nseek even yet for repentance? But do as thou wilt, I cannot, dare not,\r\nas a Christian, abide longer with you; and take again your gift,\" he\r\nsaid, offering back the chain. \"Good can never come of it, if indeed\r\nevil hath not come already.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be still and hear me, thou foolish boy,\" said Norna, calmly, as if she\r\nhad been restored to reason by the alarm and horror which she perceived\r\nin Mordaunt's countenance;--\"hear me, I say. I am not of those who have\r\nleagued themselves with the Enemy of Mankind, or derive skill or power\r\nfrom his ministry. And although the unearthly powers _were_ propitiated\r\nby a sacrifice which human tongue can never utter, yet, God knows, my\r\nguilt in that offering was no more than that of the blind man who falls\r\nfrom the precipice which he could neither see nor shun. O, leave me\r\nnot--shun me not--in this hour of weakness! Remain with me till the\r\ntemptation be passed, or I will plunge myself into that lake, and rid\r\nmyself at once of my power and my wretchedness!\"\r\n\r\nMordaunt, who had always looked up to this singular woman with a sort of\r\naffection, occasioned no doubt by the early kindness and distinction\r\nwhich she had shown to him, was readily induced to reassume his seat,\r\nand listen to what she had further to say, in hopes that she would\r\ngradually overcome the violence of her agitation. It was not long ere\r\nshe seemed to have gained the victory her companion expected, for she\r\naddressed him in her usual steady and authoritative manner.\r\n\r\n\"It was not of myself, Mordaunt, that I purposed to speak, when I beheld\r\nyou from the summit of yonder grey rock, and came down the path to meet\r\nwith you. My fortunes are fixed beyond change, be it for weal or for\r\nwoe. For myself I have ceased to feel much; but for those whom she\r\nloves, Norna of the Fitful-head has still those feelings which link her\r\nto her kind. Mark me. There is an eagle, the noblest that builds in\r\nthese airy precipices, and into that eagle's nest there has crept an\r\nadder--wilt thou lend thy aid to crush the reptile, and to save the\r\nnoble brood of the lord of the north sky?\"\r\n\r\n\"You must speak more plainly, Norna,\" said Mordaunt, \"if you would have\r\nme understand or answer you. I am no guesser of riddles.\"\r\n\r\n\"In plain language, then, you know well the family of Burgh-Westra--the\r\nlovely daughters of the generous old Udaller, Magnus Troil,--Minna and\r\nBrenda, I mean? You know them, and you love them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have known them, mother,\" replied Mordaunt, \"and I have loved\r\nthem--none knows it better than yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"To know them once,\" said Norna, emphatically, \"is to know them always.\r\nTo love them once, is to love them for ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"To have loved them once, is to wish them well for ever,\" replied the\r\nyouth; \"but it is nothing more. To be plain with you, Norna, the family\r\nat Burgh-Westra have of late totally neglected me. But show me the means\r\nof serving them, I will convince you how much I have remembered old\r\nkindness, how little I resent late coldness.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is well spoken, and I will put your purpose to the proof,\" replied\r\nNorna. \"Magnus Troil has taken a serpent into his bosom--his lovely\r\ndaughters are delivered up to the machinations of a villain.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean the stranger, Cleveland?\" said Mordaunt.\r\n\r\n\"The stranger who so calls himself,\" replied Norna--\"the same whom we\r\nfound flung ashore, like a waste heap of sea-weed, at the foot of the\r\nSumburgh-cape. I felt that within me, that would have prompted me to let\r\nhim lie till the tide floated him off, as it had floated him on shore. I\r\nrepent me I gave not way to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Mordaunt, \"I cannot repent that I did my duty as a Christian\r\nman. And what right have I to wish otherwise? If Minna, Brenda, Magnus,\r\nand the rest, like that stranger better than me, I have no title to be\r\noffended; nay, I might well be laughed at for bringing myself into\r\ncomparison.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is well, and I trust they merit thy unselfish friendship.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I cannot perceive,\" said Mordaunt, \"in what you can propose that I\r\nshould serve them. I have but just learned by Bryce the jagger, that\r\nthis Captain Cleveland is all in all with the ladies at Burgh-Westra,\r\nand with the Udaller himself. I would like ill to intrude myself where I\r\nam not welcome, or to place my home-bred merit in comparison with\r\nCaptain Cleveland's. He can tell them of battles, when I can only speak\r\nof birds' nests--can speak of shooting Frenchmen, when I can only tell\r\nof shooting seals--he wears gay clothes, and bears a brave countenance;\r\nI am plainly dressed, and plainly nurtured. Such gay gallants as he can\r\nnoose the hearts of those he lives with, as the fowler nooses the\r\nguillemot with his rod and line.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do wrong to yourself,\" replied Norna, \"wrong to yourself, and\r\ngreater wrong to Minna and Brenda. And trust not the reports of\r\nBryce--he is like the greedy chaffer-whale, that will change his course\r\nand dive for the most petty coin which a fisher can cast at him. Certain\r\nit is, that if you have been lessened in the opinion of Magnus Troil,\r\nthat sordid fellow hath had some share in it. But let him count his\r\nvantage, for my eye is upon him.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why, mother,\" said Mordaunt, \"do you not tell to Magnus what you\r\nhave told to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" replied Norna, \"they who wax wise in their own conceit must\r\nbe taught a bitter lesson by experience. It was but yesterday that I\r\nspoke with Magnus, and what was his reply?--'Good Norna, you grow old.'\r\nAnd this was spoken by one bounden to me by so many and such close\r\nties--by the descendant of the ancient Norse earls--this was from Magnus\r\nTroil to me; and it was said in behalf of one, whom the sea flung forth\r\nas wreck-weed! Since he despises the counsel of the aged, he shall be\r\ntaught by that of the young; and well that he is not left to his own\r\nfolly. Go, therefore, to Burgh-Westra, as usual, upon the Baptist's\r\nfestival.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have had no invitation,\" said Mordaunt; \"I am not wanted, not wished\r\nfor, not thought of--perhaps I shall not be acknowledged if I go\r\nthither; and yet, mother, to confess the truth, thither I had thought to\r\ngo.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was a good thought, and to be cherished,\" replied Norna; \"we seek\r\nour friends when they are sick in health, why not when they are sick in\r\nmind, and surfeited with prosperity? Do not fail to go--it may be, we\r\nshall meet there. Meanwhile our roads lie different. Farewell, and speak\r\nnot of this meeting.\"\r\n\r\nThey parted, and Mordaunt remained standing by the lake, with his eyes\r\nfixed on Norna, until her tall dark form became invisible among the\r\nwindings of the valley down which she wandered, and Mordaunt returned to\r\nhis father's mansion, determined to follow counsel which coincided so\r\nwell with his own wishes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[36] The Drows, or Trows, the legitimate successors of the northern\r\n_duergar_, and somewhat allied to the fairies, reside, like them, in the\r\ninterior of green hills and caverns, and are most powerful at midnight.\r\nThey are curious artificers in iron, as well as in the precious metals,\r\nand are sometimes propitious to mortals, but more frequently capricious\r\nand malevolent. Among the common people of Zetland, their existence\r\nstill forms an article of universal belief. In the neighbouring isles of\r\nFeroe, they are called Foddenskencand, or subterranean people; and Lucas\r\nJacobson Debes,(_h_) well acquainted with their nature, assures us that\r\nthey inhabit those places which are polluted with the effusion of blood,\r\nor the practice of any crying sin. They have a government, which seems\r\nto be monarchical.\r\n\r\n[37] The larger seal, or sea-calf, which seeks the most solitary\r\nrecesses for its abode. See Dr. EDMONSTONE'S _Zetland_, vol. ii., p.\r\n294.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n          ----All your ancient customs,\r\n  And long-descended usages, I'll change.\r\n  Ye shall not eat, nor drink, nor speak, nor move,\r\n  Think, look, or walk, as ye were wont to do.\r\n  Even your marriage-beds shall know mutation;\r\n  The bride shall have the stock, the groom the wall;\r\n  For all old practice will I turn and change,\r\n  And call it reformation--marry will I!\r\n\r\n                             _'Tis Even that we're at Odds._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe festal day approached, and still no invitation arrived for that\r\nguest, without whom, but a little space since, no feast could have been\r\nheld in the island; while, on the other hand, such reports as reached\r\nthem on every side spoke highly of the favour which Captain Cleveland\r\nenjoyed in the good graces of the old Udaller of Burgh-Westra. Swertha\r\nand the Ranzelman shook their heads at these mutations, and reminded\r\nMordaunt, by many a half-hint and innuendo, that he had incurred this\r\neclipse by being so imprudently active to secure the safety of the\r\nstranger, when he lay at the mercy of the next wave beneath the cliffs\r\nof Sumburgh-head. \"It is best to let saut water take its gate,\" said\r\nSwertha; \"luck never came of crossing it.\"\r\n\r\n\"In troth,\" said the Ranzelman, \"they are wise folks that let wave and\r\nwithy haud their ain--luck never came of a half-drowned man, or a\r\nhalf-hanged ane either. Who was't shot Will Paterson off the Noss?--the\r\nDutchman that he saved from sinking, I trow. To fling a drowning man a\r\nplank or a tow, may be the part of a Christian; but I say, keep hands\r\naff him, if ye wad live and thrive free frae his danger.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye are a wise man, Ranzelman, and a worthy,\" echoed Swertha, with a\r\ngroan, \"and ken how and whan to help a neighbour, as well as ony man\r\nthat ever drew a net.\"\r\n\r\n\"In troth, I have seen length of days,\" answered the Ranzelman, \"and I\r\nhave heard what the auld folk said to each other anent sic matters; and\r\nnae man in Zetland shall go farther than I will in any Christian service\r\nto a man on firm land; but if he cry 'Help!' out of the saut waves,\r\nthat's another story.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet, to think of this lad Cleveland standing in our Maister\r\nMordaunt's light,\" said Swertha, \"and with Magnus Troil, that thought\r\nhim the flower of the island but on Whitsunday last, and Magnus, too,\r\nthat's both held (when he's fresh, honest man) the wisest and wealthiest\r\nof Zetland!\"\r\n\r\n\"He canna win by it,\" said the Ranzelman, with a look of the deepest\r\nsagacity. \"There's whiles, Swertha, that the wisest of us (as I am sure\r\nI humbly confess mysell not to be) may be little better than gulls, and\r\ncan no more win by doing deeds of folly than I can step over\r\nSumburgh-head. It has been my own case once or twice in my life. But we\r\nshall see soon what ill is to come of all this, for good there cannot\r\ncome.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Swertha answered, with the same tone of prophetic wisdom, \"Na, na,\r\ngude can never come on it, and that is ower truly said.\"\r\n\r\nThese doleful predictions, repeated from time to time, had some effect\r\nupon Mordaunt. He did not indeed suppose, that the charitable action of\r\nrelieving a drowning man had subjected him, as a necessary and fatal\r\nconsequence, to the unpleasant circumstances in which he was placed; yet\r\nhe felt as if a sort of spell were drawn around him, of which he neither\r\nunderstood the nature nor the extent;--that some power, in short, beyond\r\nhis own control, was acting upon his destiny, and, as it seemed, with no\r\nfriendly influence. His curiosity, as well as his anxiety, was highly\r\nexcited, and he continued determined, at all events, to make his\r\nappearance at the approaching festival, when he was impressed with the\r\nbelief that something uncommon was necessarily to take place, which\r\nshould determine his future views and prospects in life.\r\n\r\nAs the elder Mertoun was at this time in his ordinary state of health,\r\nit became necessary that his son should intimate to him his intended\r\nvisit to Burgh-Westra. He did so; and his father desired to know the\r\nespecial reason of his going thither at this particular time.\r\n\r\n\"It is a time of merry-making,\" replied the youth, \"and all the country\r\nare assembled.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are doubtless impatient to add another fool to the\r\nnumber.--Go--but beware how you walk in the path which you are about to\r\ntread--a fall from the cliffs of Foulah were not more fatal.\"\r\n\r\n\"May I ask the reason of your caution, sir?\" replied Mordaunt, breaking\r\nthrough the reserve which ordinarily subsisted betwixt him and his\r\nsingular parent.\r\n\r\n\"Magnus Troil,\" said the elder Mertoun, \"has two daughters--you are of\r\nthe age when men look upon such gauds with eyes of affection, that they\r\nmay afterwards learn to curse the day that first opened their eyes upon\r\nheaven! I bid you beware of them; for, as sure as that death and sin\r\ncame into the world by woman, so sure are their soft words, and softer\r\nlooks, the utter destruction and ruin of all who put faith in them.\"\r\n\r\nMordaunt had sometimes observed his father's marked dislike to the\r\nfemale sex, but had never before heard him give vent to it in terms so\r\ndetermined and precise. He replied, that the daughters of Magnus Troil\r\nwere no more to him than any other females in the islands; \"they were\r\neven of less importance,\" he said, \"for they had broken off their\r\nfriendship with him, without assigning any cause.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you go to seek the renewal of it?\" answered his father. \"Silly\r\nmoth, that hast once escaped the taper without singeing thy wings, are\r\nyou not contented with the safe obscurity of these wilds, but must\r\nhasten back to the flame, which is sure at length to consume thee? But\r\nwhy should I waste arguments in deterring thee from thy inevitable\r\nfate?--Go where thy destiny calls thee.\"\r\n\r\nOn the succeeding day, which was the eve of the great festival, Mordaunt\r\nset forth on his road to Burgh-Westra, pondering alternately on the\r\ninjunctions of Norna--on the ominous words of his father--on the\r\ninauspicious auguries of Swertha and the Ranzelman of Jarlshof--and not\r\nwithout experiencing that gloom with which so many concurring\r\ncircumstances of ill omen combined to oppress his mind.\r\n\r\n\"It bodes me but a cold reception at Burgh-Westra,\" said he; \"but my\r\nstay shall be the shorter. I will but find out whether they have been\r\ndeceived by this seafaring stranger, or whether they have acted out of\r\npure caprice of temper, and love of change of company. If the first be\r\nthe case, I will vindicate my character, and let Captain Cleveland look\r\nto himself;--if the latter, why, then, good-night to Burgh-Westra and\r\nall its inmates.\"\r\n\r\nAs he mentally meditated this last alternative, hurt pride, and a return\r\nof fondness for those to whom he supposed he was bidding farewell for\r\never, brought a tear into his eye, which he dashed off hastily and\r\nindignantly, as, mending his pace, he continued on his journey.\r\n\r\nThe weather being now serene and undisturbed, Mordaunt made his way with\r\nan ease that formed a striking contrast to the difficulties which he had\r\nencountered when he last travelled the same route; yet there was a less\r\npleasing subject for comparison, within his own mind.\r\n\r\n\"My breast,\" he said to himself, \"was then against the wind, but my\r\nheart within was serene and happy. I would I had now the same careless\r\nfeelings, were they to be bought by battling with the severest storm\r\nthat ever blew across these lonely hills!\"\r\n\r\nWith such thoughts, he arrived about noon at Harfra, the habitation, as\r\nthe reader may remember, of the ingenious Mr. Yellowley. Our traveller\r\nhad, upon the present occasion, taken care to be quite independent of\r\nthe niggardly hospitality of this mansion, which was now become infamous\r\non that account through the whole island, by bringing with him, in his\r\nsmall knapsack, such provisions as might have sufficed for a longer\r\njourney. In courtesy, however, or rather, perhaps, to get rid of his own\r\ndisquieting thoughts, Mordaunt did not fail to call at the mansion,\r\nwhich he found in singular commotion. Triptolemus himself, invested\r\nwith a pair of large jack-boots, went clattering up and down stairs,\r\nscreaming out questions to his sister and his serving-woman Tronda, who\r\nreplied with shriller and more complicated screeches. At length, Mrs.\r\nBaby herself made her appearance, her venerable person endued with what\r\nwas then called a joseph, an ample garment, which had once been green,\r\nbut now, betwixt stains and patches, had become like the vesture of the\r\npatriarch whose name it bore--a garment of divers colours. A\r\nsteeple-crowned hat, the purchase of some long-past moment, in which\r\nvanity had got the better of avarice, with a feather which had stood as\r\nmuch wind and rain as if it had been part of a seamew's wing, made up\r\nher equipment, save that in her hand she held a silver-mounted whip of\r\nantique fashion. This attire, as well as an air of determined bustle in\r\nthe gait and appearance of Mrs. Barbara Yellowley, seemed to bespeak\r\nthat she was prepared to take a journey, and cared not, as the saying\r\ngoes, who knew that such was her determination.\r\n\r\nShe was the first that observed Mordaunt on his arrival, and she greeted\r\nhim with a degree of mingled emotion. \"Be good to us!\" she exclaimed,\r\n\"if here is not the canty callant that wears yon thing about his neck,\r\nand that snapped up our goose as light as if it had been a\r\nsandie-lavrock!\" The admiration of the gold chain, which had formerly\r\nmade so deep an impression on her mind, was marked in the first part of\r\nher speech, the recollection of the untimely fate of the smoked goose\r\nwas commemorated in the second clause. \"I will lay the burden of my\r\nlife,\" she instantly added, \"that he is ganging our gate.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am bound for Burgh-Westra, Mrs. Yellowley,\" said Mordaunt.\r\n\r\n\"And blithe will we be of your company,\" she added--\"it's early day to\r\neat; but if you liked a barley scone and a drink of bland--natheless, it\r\nis ill travelling on a full stomach, besides quelling your appetite for\r\nthe feast that is biding you this day; for all sort of prodigality there\r\nwill doubtless be.\"\r\n\r\nMordaunt produced his own stores, and, explaining that he did not love\r\nto be burdensome to them on this second occasion, invited them to\r\npartake of the provisions he had to offer. Poor Triptolemus, who seldom\r\nsaw half so good a dinner as his guest's luncheon, threw himself upon\r\nthe good cheer, like Sancho on the scum of Camacho's kettle, and even\r\nthe lady herself could not resist the temptation, though she gave way to\r\nit with more moderation, and with something like a sense of shame. \"She\r\nhad let the fire out,\" she said, \"for it was a pity wasting fuel in so\r\ncold a country, and so she had not thought of getting any thing ready,\r\nas they were to set out so soon; and so she could not but say, that the\r\nyoung gentleman's _nacket_ looked very good; and besides, she had some\r\ncuriosity to see whether the folks in that country cured their beef in\r\nthe same way they did in the north of Scotland.\" Under which combined\r\nconsiderations, Dame Baby made a hearty experiment on the refreshments\r\nwhich thus unexpectedly presented themselves.\r\n\r\nWhen their extemporary repast was finished, the factor became solicitous\r\nto take the road; and now Mordaunt discovered, that the alacrity with\r\nwhich he had been received by Mistress Baby was not altogether\r\ndisinterested. Neither she nor the learned Triptolemus felt much\r\ndisposed to commit themselves to the wilds of Zetland, without the\r\nassistance of a guide; and although they could have commanded the aid of\r\none of their own labouring folks, yet the cautious agriculturist\r\nobserved, that it would be losing at least one day's work; and his\r\nsister multiplied his apprehensions by echoing back, \"One day's\r\nwork?--ye may weel say twenty--for, set ane of their noses within the\r\nsmell of a kail-pot, and their lugs within the sound of a fiddle, and\r\nwhistle them back if ye can!\"\r\n\r\nNow the fortunate arrival of Mordaunt, in the very nick of time, not to\r\nmention the good cheer which he brought with him, made him as welcome as\r\nany one could possibly be to a threshold, which, on all ordinary\r\noccasions, abhorred the passage of a guest; nor was Mr. Yellowley\r\naltogether insensible of the pleasure he promised himself in detailing\r\nhis plans of improvement to his young companion, and enjoying what his\r\nfate seldom assigned him--the company of a patient and admiring\r\nlistener.\r\n\r\nAs the factor and his sister were to prosecute their journey on\r\nhorseback, it only remained to mount their guide and companion; a thing\r\neasily accomplished, where there are such numbers of shaggy,\r\nlong-backed, short-legged ponies, running wild upon the extensive moors,\r\nwhich are the common pasturage for the cattle of every township, where\r\nshelties, geese, swine, goats, sheep, and little Zetland cows, are\r\nturned out promiscuously, and often in numbers which can obtain but\r\nprecarious subsistence from the niggard vegetation. There is, indeed, a\r\nright of individual property in all these animals, which are branded or\r\ntattooed by each owner with his own peculiar mark; but when any\r\npassenger has occasional use for a pony, he never scruples to lay hold\r\nof the first which he can catch, puts on a halter, and, having rode him\r\nas far as he finds convenient, turns the animal loose to find his way\r\nback again as he best can--a matter in which the ponies are sufficiently\r\nsagacious.\r\n\r\nAlthough this general exercise of property was one of the enormities\r\nwhich in due time the factor intended to abolish, yet, like a wise man,\r\nhe scrupled not, in the meantime, to avail himself of so general a\r\npractice, which, he condescended to allow, was particularly convenient\r\nfor those who (as chanced to be his own present case) had no ponies of\r\ntheir own on which their neighbours could retaliate. Three shelties,\r\ntherefore, were procured from the hill--little shagged animals, more\r\nresembling wild bears than any thing of the horse tribe, yet possessed\r\nof no small degree of strength and spirit, and able to endure as much\r\nfatigue and indifferent usage as any creatures in the world.\r\n\r\nTwo of these horses were already provided and fully accoutred for the\r\njourney. One of them, destined to bear the fair person of Mistress Baby,\r\nwas decorated with a huge side-saddle of venerable antiquity--a mass, as\r\nit were, of cushion and padding, from which depended, on all sides, a\r\nhousing of ancient tapestry, which, having been originally intended for\r\na horse of ordinary size, covered up the diminutive palfrey over which\r\nit was spread, from the ears to the tail, and from the shoulder to the\r\nfetlock, leaving nothing visible but its head, which looked fiercely out\r\nfrom these enfoldments, like the heraldic representation of a lion\r\nlooking out of a bush. Mordaunt gallantly lifted up the fair Mistress\r\nYellowley, and at the expense of very slight exertion, placed her upon\r\nthe summit of her mountainous saddle. It is probable, that, on feeling\r\nherself thus squired and attended upon, and experiencing the long\r\nunwonted consciousness that she was attired in her best array, some\r\nthoughts dawned upon Mistress Baby's mind, which checkered, for an\r\ninstant, those habitual ideas about thrift, that formed the daily and\r\nall-engrossing occupation of her soul. She glanced her eye upon her\r\nfaded joseph, and on the long housings of her saddle, as she observed,\r\nwith a smile, to Mordaunt, that \"travelling was a pleasant thing in fine\r\nweather and agreeable company, if,\" she added, glancing a look at a\r\nplace where the embroidery was somewhat frayed and tattered, \"it was not\r\nsae wasteful to ane's horse-furniture.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, her brother stepped stoutly to his steed; and as he chose,\r\nnotwithstanding the serenity of the weather, to throw a long red cloak\r\nover his other garments, his pony was even more completely enveloped in\r\ndrapery than that of his sister. It happened, moreover, to be an animal\r\nof an high and contumacious spirit, bouncing and curvetting occasionally\r\nunder the weight of Triptolemus, with a vivacity which, notwithstanding\r\nhis Yorkshire descent, rather deranged him in the saddle; gambols which,\r\nas the palfrey itself was not visible, except upon the strictest\r\ninspection, had, at a little distance, an effect as if they were the\r\nvoluntary movements of the cloaked cavalier, without the assistance of\r\nany other legs than those with which nature had provided him; and, to\r\nany who had viewed Triptolemus under such a persuasion, the gravity, and\r\neven distress, announced in his countenance, must have made a ridiculous\r\ncontrast to the vivacious caprioles with which he piaffed along the\r\nmoor.\r\n\r\nMordaunt kept up with this worthy couple, mounted, according to the\r\nsimplicity of the time and country, on the first and readiest pony which\r\nthey had been able to press into the service, with no other accoutrement\r\nof any kind than the halter which served to guide him; while Mr.\r\nYellowley, seeing with pleasure his guide thus readily provided with a\r\nsteed, privately resolved, that this rude custom of helping travellers\r\nto horses, without leave of the proprietor, should not be abated in\r\nZetland, until he came to possess a herd of ponies belonging in property\r\nto himself, and exposed to suffer in the way of retaliation.\r\n\r\nBut to other uses or abuses of the country, Triptolemus Yellowley showed\r\nhimself less tolerant. Long and wearisome were the discourses he held\r\nwith Mordaunt, or (to speak much more correctly) the harangues which he\r\ninflicted upon him, concerning the changes which his own advent in these\r\nisles was about to occasion. Unskilled as he was in the modern arts by\r\nwhich an estate may be improved to such a high degree that it shall\r\naltogether slip through the proprietor's fingers, Triptolemus had at\r\nleast the zeal, if not the knowledge, of a whole agricultural society in\r\nhis own person; nor was he surpassed by any who has followed him, in\r\nthat noble spirit which scorns to balance profit against outlay, but\r\nholds the glory of effecting a great change on the face of the land, to\r\nbe, like virtue, in a great degree its own reward.\r\n\r\nNo part of the wild and mountainous region over which Mordaunt guided\r\nhim, but what suggested to his active imagination some scheme of\r\nimprovement and alteration. He would make a road through yon scarce\r\npassable glen, where at present nothing but the sure-footed creatures on\r\nwhich they were mounted could tread with any safety. He would substitute\r\nbetter houses for the skeoes, or sheds built of dry stones, in which the\r\ninhabitants cured or manufactured their fish--they should brew good ale\r\ninstead of bland--they should plant forests where tree never grew, and\r\nfind mines of treasure where a Danish skilling was accounted a coin of a\r\nmost respectable denomination. All these mutations, with many others,\r\ndid the worthy factor resolve upon, speaking at the same time with the\r\nutmost confidence of the countenance and assistance which he was to\r\nreceive from the higher classes, and especially from Magnus Troil.\r\n\r\n\"I will impart some of my ideas to the poor man,\" he said, \"before we\r\nare both many hours older; and you will mark how grateful he will be to\r\nthe instructor who brings him knowledge, which is better than wealth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would not have you build too strongly on that,\" said Mordaunt, by way\r\nof caution; \"Magnus Troil's boat is kittle to trim--he likes his own\r\nways, and his country-ways, and you will as soon teach your sheltie to\r\ndive like a sealgh, as bring Magnus to take a Scottish fashion in the\r\nplace of a Norse one; and yet, if he is steady to his old customs, he\r\nmay perhaps be as changeable as another in his old friendships.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Heus, tu inepte!_\" said the scholar of Saint Andrews, \"steady or\r\nunsteady, what can it matter?--am not I here in point of trust, and in\r\npoint of power? and shall a Fowd, by which barbarous appellative this\r\nMagnus Troil still calls himself, presume to measure judgment and weigh\r\nreasons with me, who represent the full dignity of the Chamberlain of\r\nthe islands of Orkney and Zetland?\"\r\n\r\n\"Still,\" said Mordaunt, \"I would advise you not to advance too rashly\r\nupon his prejudices. Magnus Troil, from the hour of his birth to this\r\nday, never saw a greater man than himself, and it is difficult to bridle\r\nan old horse for the first time. Besides, he has at no time in his life\r\nbeen a patient listener to long explanations, so it is possible that he\r\nmay quarrel with your purposed reformation, before you can convince him\r\nof its advantages.\"\r\n\r\n\"How mean you, young man?\" said the factor. \"Is there one who dwells in\r\nthese islands, who is so wretchedly blind as not to be sensible of their\r\ndeplorable defects? Can a man,\" he added, rising into enthusiasm as he\r\nspoke, \"or even a beast, look at that thing there, which they have the\r\nimpudence to call a corn-mill,[38] without trembling to think that corn\r\nshould be intrusted to such a miserable molendinary? The wretches are\r\nobliged to have at least fifty in each parish, each trundling away upon\r\nits paltry mill-stone, under the thatch of a roof no bigger than a\r\nbee-skep, instead of a noble and seemly baron's mill, of which you would\r\nhear the clack through the haill country, and that casts the meal\r\nthrough the mill-eye by forpits at a time!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, brother,\" said his sister, \"that's spoken like your wise sell.\r\nThe mair cost the mair honour--that's your word ever mair. Can it no\r\ncreep into your wise head, man, that ilka body grinds their ain nievefu'\r\nof meal in this country, without plaguing themsells about barons' mills,\r\nand thirls, and sucken, and the like trade? How mony a time have I\r\nheard you bell-the-cat with auld Edie Netherstane, the miller at\r\nGrindleburn, and wi' his very knave too, about in-town and out-town\r\nmultures--lock, gowpen, and knaveship,(_i_) and a' the lave o't; and now\r\nnaething less will serve you than to bring in the very same fashery on a\r\nwheen puir bodies, that big ilk ane a mill for themselves, sic as it\r\nis?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dinna tell me of gowpen and knaveship!\" exclaimed the indignant\r\nagriculturist; \"better pay the half of the grist to the miller, to have\r\nthe rest grund in a Christian manner, than put good grain into a bairn's\r\nwhirligig. Look at it for a moment, Baby--Bide still, ye cursed imp!\"\r\nThis interjection was applied to his pony, which began to be extremely\r\nimpatient, while its rider interrupted his journey, to point out\r\nall the weak points of the Zetland mill--\"Look at it, I say--it's\r\njust one degree better than a hand-quern--it has neither wheel nor\r\ntrindle--neither cog nor happer--Bide still, there's a canny\r\nbeast--it canna grind a bickerfu' of meal in a quarter of an hour,\r\nand that will be mair like a mash for horse than a meltith for man's\r\nuse--Wherefore--Bide still, I say--wherefore--wherefore--The deil's in\r\nthe beast, and nae good, I think!\"\r\n\r\nAs he uttered the last words, the shelty, which had pranced and\r\ncurvetted for some time with much impatience, at length got its head\r\nbetwixt its legs, and at once canted its rider into the little rivulet,\r\nwhich served to drive the depreciated engine he was surveying; then\r\nemancipating itself from the folds of the cloak, fled back towards its\r\nown wilderness, neighing in scorn, and flinging out its heels at every\r\nfive yards.\r\n\r\nLaughing heartily at his disaster, Mordaunt helped the old man to arise;\r\nwhile his sister sarcastically congratulated him on having fallen rather\r\ninto the shallows of a Zetland rivulet than the depths of a Scottish\r\nmill-pond. Disdaining to reply to this sarcasm, Triptolemus, so soon as\r\nhe had recovered his legs, shaken his ears, and found that the folds of\r\nhis cloak had saved him from being much wet in the scanty streamlet,\r\nexclaimed aloud, \"I will have cussers from Lanarkshire--brood mares from\r\nAyrshire--I will not have one of these cursed abortions left on the\r\nislands, to break honest folk's necks--I say, Baby, I will rid the land\r\nof them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye had better wring your ain cloak, Triptolemus,\" answered Baby.\r\n\r\nMordaunt meanwhile was employed in catching another pony, from a herd\r\nwhich strayed at some distance; and, having made a halter out of twisted\r\nrushes, he seated the dismayed agriculturist in safety upon a more\r\nquiet, though less active steed, than that which he had at first\r\nbestrode.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Yellowley's fall had operated as a considerable sedative upon\r\nhis spirits, and, for the full space of five miles' travel, he said\r\nscarce a word, leaving full course to the melancholy aspirations and\r\nlamentations which his sister Baby bestowed on the old bridle, which the\r\npony had carried off in its flight, and which, she observed, after\r\nhaving lasted for eighteen years come Martinmas, might now be considered\r\nas a castaway thing. Finding she had thus the field to herself, the old\r\nlady launched forth into a lecture upon economy, according to her own\r\nidea of that virtue, which seemed to include a system of privations,\r\nwhich, though observed with the sole purpose of saving money, might, if\r\nundertaken upon other principles, have ranked high in the history of a\r\nreligious ascetic.\r\n\r\nShe was but little interrupted by Mordaunt, who, conscious he was now on\r\nthe eve of approaching Burgh-Westra, employed himself rather in the task\r\nof anticipating the nature of the reception he was about to meet with\r\nthere from two beautiful young women, than with the prosing of an old\r\none, however wisely she might prove that small-beer was more wholesome\r\nthan strong ale, and that if her brother had bruised his ankle bone in\r\nhis tumble, cumfrey and butter was better to bring him round again, than\r\nall the doctor's drugs in the world.\r\n\r\nBut now the dreary moorlands, over which their path had hitherto lain,\r\nwere exchanged for a more pleasant prospect, opening on a salt-water\r\nlake, or arm of the sea, which ran up far inland, and was surrounded by\r\nflat and fertile ground, producing crops better than the experienced eye\r\nof Triptolemus Yellowley had as yet witnessed in Zetland. In the midst\r\nof this Goshen stood the mansion of Burgh-Westra, screened from the\r\nnorth and east by a ridge of heathy hills which lay behind it, and\r\ncommanding an interesting prospect of the lake and its parent ocean, as\r\nwell as the islands, and more distant mountains. From the mansion\r\nitself, as well as from almost every cottage in the adjacent hamlet,\r\narose such a rich cloud of vapoury smoke, as showed, that the\r\npreparations for the festival were not confined to the principal\r\nresidence of Magnus himself, but extended through the whole vicinage.\r\n\r\n\"My certie,\" said Mrs. Baby Yellowley, \"ane wad think the haill town was\r\non fire! The very hill-side smells of their wastefulness, and a hungry\r\nheart wad scarce seek better kitchen[39] to a barley scone, than just\r\nto waft it in the reek that's rising out of yon lums.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[38] Note VI.--Zetland Corn-mills.\r\n\r\n[39] What is eat by way of relish to dry bread is called _kitchen_ in\r\nScotland, as cheese, dried fish, or the like relishing morsels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n            ----Thou hast described\r\n  A hot friend cooling. Ever note, Lucilius,\r\n  When love begins to sicken and decay,\r\n  It useth an enforced ceremony.\r\n  There are no tricks in plain and simple faith.\r\n\r\n                                             _Julius Cæsar._\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the smell which was wafted from the chimneys of Burgh-Westra up to\r\nthe barren hills by which the mansion was surrounded, could, as Mistress\r\nBarbara opined, have refreshed the hungry, the noise which proceeded\r\nfrom thence might have given hearing to the deaf. It was a medley of all\r\nsounds, and all connected with jollity and kind welcome. Nor were the\r\nsights associated with them less animating.\r\n\r\nTroops of friends were seen in the act of arriving--their dispersed\r\nponies flying to the moors in every direction, to recover their own\r\npastures in the best way they could;--such, as we have already said,\r\nbeing the usual mode of discharging the cavalry which had been levied\r\nfor a day's service. At a small but commodious harbour, connected with\r\nthe house and hamlet, those visitors were landing from their boats, who,\r\nliving in distant islands, and along the coast, had preferred making\r\ntheir journey by sea. Mordaunt and his companions might see each party\r\npausing frequently to greet each other, and strolling on successively to\r\nthe house, whose ever open gate received them alternately in such\r\nnumbers, that it seemed the extent of the mansion, though suited to the\r\nopulence and hospitality of the owner, was scarce, on this occasion,\r\nsufficient for the guests.\r\n\r\nAmong the confused sounds of mirth and welcome which arose at the\r\nentrance of each new company, Mordaunt thought he could distinguish the\r\nloud laugh and hearty salutation of the Sire of the mansion, and began\r\nto feel more deeply than before, the anxious doubt, whether that cordial\r\nreception, which was distributed so freely to all others, would be on\r\nthis occasion extended to him. As they came on, they heard the voluntary\r\nscrapings and bravura effusions of the gallant fiddlers, who impatiently\r\nflung already from their bows those sounds with which they were to\r\nanimate the evening. The clamour of the cook's assistants, and the loud\r\nscolding tones of the cook himself, were also to be heard--sounds of\r\ndissonance at any other time, but which, subdued with others, and by\r\ncertain happy associations, form no disagreeable part of the full chorus\r\nwhich always precedes a rural feast.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the guests advanced, each full of their own thoughts.\r\nMordaunt's we have already noticed. Baby was wrapt up in the melancholy\r\ngrief and surprise excited by the positive conviction, that so much\r\nvictuals had been cooked at once as were necessary to feed all the\r\nmouths which were clamouring around her--an enormity of expense, which,\r\nthough she was no way concerned in bearing it, affected her nerves, as\r\nthe beholding a massacre would touch those of the most indifferent\r\nspectator, however well assured of his own personal safety. She\r\nsickened, in short, at the sight of so much extravagance, like\r\nAbyssinian Bruce, when he saw the luckless minstrels of Gondar hacked to\r\npieces by the order of Ras Michael. As for her brother, they being now\r\narrived where the rude and antique instruments of Zetland agriculture\r\nlay scattered in the usual confusion of a Scottish barn-yard, his\r\nthoughts were at once engrossed in the deficiencies of the one-stilted\r\nplough--of the _twiscar_, with which they dig peats--of the sledges, on\r\nwhich they transport commodities--of all and every thing, in short, in\r\nwhich the usages of the islands differed from those of the mainland of\r\nScotland. The sight of these imperfect instruments stirred the blood of\r\nTriptolemus Yellowley, as that of the bold warrior rises at seeing the\r\narms and insignia of the enemy he is about to combat; and, faithful to\r\nhis high emprise, he thought less of the hunger which his journey had\r\noccasioned, although about to be satisfied by such a dinner as rarely\r\nfell to his lot, than upon the task which he had undertaken, of\r\ncivilizing the manners, and improving the cultivation, of Zetland.\r\n\r\n\"_Jacta est alea_,\" he muttered to himself; \"this very day shall prove\r\nwhether the Zetlanders are worthy of our labours, or whether their minds\r\nare as incapable of cultivation as their peat-mosses. Yet let us be\r\ncautious, and watch the soft time of speech. I feel, by my own\r\nexperience, that it were best to let the body, in its present state,\r\ntake the place of the mind. A mouthful of that same roast-beef, which\r\nsmells so delicately, will form an apt introduction to my grand plan for\r\nimproving the breed of stock.\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the visitors had reached the low but ample front of Magnus\r\nTroil's residence, which seemed of various dates, with large and\r\nill-imagined additions, hastily adapted to the original building, as the\r\nincreasing estate, or enlarged family, of successive proprietors,\r\nappeared to each to demand. Beneath a low, broad, and large porch,\r\nsupported by two huge carved posts, once the head-ornaments of vessels\r\nwhich had found shipwreck upon the coast, stood Magnus himself, intent\r\non the hospitable toil of receiving and welcoming the numerous guests\r\nwho successively approached. His strong portly figure was well adapted\r\nto the dress which he wore--a blue coat of an antique cut, lined with\r\nscarlet, and laced and looped with gold down the seams and button-holes,\r\nand along the ample cuffs. Strong and masculine features, rendered ruddy\r\nand brown by frequent exposure to severe weather--a quantity of most\r\nvenerable silver hair, which fell in unshorn profusion from under his\r\ngold-laced hat, and was carelessly tied with a ribbon behind, expressed\r\nat once his advanced age, his hasty, yet well-conditioned temper, and\r\nhis robust constitution. As our travellers approached him, a shade of\r\ndispleasure seemed to cross his brow, and to interrupt for an instant\r\nthe honest and hearty burst of hilarity with which he had been in the\r\nact of greeting all prior arrivals. When he approached Triptolemus\r\nYellowley, he drew himself up, so as to mix, as it were, some share of\r\nthe stately importance of the opulent Udaller with the welcome afforded\r\nby the frank and hospitable landlord.\r\n\r\n\"You are welcome, Mr. Yellowley,\" was his address to the factor; \"you\r\nare welcome to Westra--the wind has blown you on a rough coast, and we\r\nthat are the natives must be kind to you as we can. This, I believe, is\r\nyour sister--Mistress Barbara Yellowley, permit me the honour of a\r\nneighbourly salute.\"--And so saying, with a daring and self-devoted\r\ncourtesy, which would find no equal in our degenerate days, he actually\r\nventured to salute the withered cheek of the spinster, who relaxed so\r\nmuch of her usual peevishness of expression, as to receive the courtesy\r\nwith something which approached to a smile. He then looked full at\r\nMordaunt Mertoun, and without offering his hand, said, in a tone\r\nsomewhat broken by suppressed agitation, \"You too are welcome, Master\r\nMordaunt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I not think so,\" said Mordaunt, naturally offended by the coldness\r\nof his host's manner, \"I had not been here--and it is not yet too late\r\nto turn back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Young man,\" replied Magnus, \"you know better than most, that from these\r\ndoors no man can turn, without an offence to their owner. I pray you,\r\ndisturb not my guests by your ill-timed scruples. When Magnus Troil says\r\nwelcome, all are welcome who are within hearing of his voice, and it is\r\nan indifferent loud one.--Walk on, my worthy guests, and let us see what\r\ncheer my lasses can make you within doors.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, and taking care to make his manner so general to the whole\r\nparty, that Mordaunt should not be able to appropriate any particular\r\nportion of the welcome to himself, nor yet to complain of being excluded\r\nfrom all share in it, the Udaller ushered the guests into his house,\r\nwhere two large outer rooms, which, on the present occasion, served the\r\npurpose of a modern saloon, were already crowded with guests of every\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nThe furniture was sufficiently simple, and had a character peculiar to\r\nthe situation of those stormy islands. Magnus Troil was, indeed, like\r\nmost of the higher class of Zetland proprietors, a friend to the\r\ndistressed traveller, whether by sea or land, and had repeatedly exerted\r\nhis whole authority in protecting the property and persons of\r\nshipwrecked mariners; yet so frequent were wrecks upon that tremendous\r\ncoast, and so many unappropriated articles were constantly flung ashore,\r\nthat the interior of the house bore sufficient witness to the ravages of\r\nthe ocean, and to the exercise of those rights which the lawyers term\r\n_Flotsome and Jetsome_. The chairs, which were arranged around the\r\nwalls, were such as are used in cabins, and many of them were of foreign\r\nconstruction; the mirrors and cabinets, which were placed against the\r\nwalls for ornament or convenience, had, it was plain from their form,\r\nbeen constructed for ship-board, and one or two of the latter were of\r\nstrange and unknown wood. Even the partition which separated the two\r\napartments, seemed constructed out of the bulkhead of some large vessel,\r\nclumsily adapted to the service which it at present performed, by the\r\nlabour of some native joiner. To a stranger, these evident marks and\r\ntokens of human misery might, at the first glance, form a contrast with\r\nthe scene of mirth with which they were now associated; but the\r\nassociation was so familiar to the natives, that it did not for a moment\r\ninterrupt the course of their glee.\r\n\r\nTo the younger part of these revellers the presence of Mordaunt was like\r\na fresh charm of enjoyment. All came around him to marvel at his\r\nabsence, and all, by their repeated enquiries, plainly showed that they\r\nconceived it had been entirely voluntary on his side. The youth felt\r\nthat this general acceptation relieved his anxiety on one painful point.\r\nWhatever prejudice the family of Burgh-Westra might have adopted\r\nrespecting him, it must be of a private nature; and at least he had not\r\nthe additional pain of finding that he was depreciated in the eyes of\r\nsociety at large; and his vindication, when he found opportunity to make\r\none, would not require to be extended beyond the circle of a single\r\nfamily. This was consoling; though his heart still throbbed with anxiety\r\nat the thought of meeting with his estranged, but still beloved friends.\r\nLaying the excuse of his absence on his father's state of health, he\r\nmade his way through the various groups of friends and guests, each of\r\nwhom seemed willing to detain him as long as possible, and having, by\r\npresenting them to one or two families of consequence, got rid of his\r\ntravelling companions, who at first stuck fast as burs, he reached at\r\nlength the door of a small apartment, which, opening from one of the\r\nlarge exterior rooms we have mentioned, Minna and Brenda had been\r\npermitted to fit up after their own taste, and to call their peculiar\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nMordaunt had contributed no small share of the invention and mechanical\r\nexecution employed in fitting up this favourite apartment, and in\r\ndisposing its ornaments. It was, indeed, during his last residence at\r\nBurgh-Westra, as free to his entrance and occupation, as to its proper\r\nmistresses. But now, so much were times altered, that he remained with\r\nhis finger on the latch, uncertain whether he should take the freedom to\r\ndraw it, until Brenda's voice pronounced the words, \"Come in, then,\" in\r\nthe tone of one who is interrupted by an unwelcome disturber, who is to\r\nbe heard and dispatched with all the speed possible.\r\n\r\nAt this signal Mertoun entered the fanciful cabinet of the sisters,\r\nwhich by the addition of many ornaments, including some articles of\r\nconsiderable value, had been fitted up for the approaching festival. The\r\ndaughters of Magnus, at the moment of Mordaunt's entrance, were seated\r\nin deep consultation with the stranger Cleveland, and with a little\r\nslight-made old man, whose eye retained all the vivacity of spirit,\r\nwhich had supported him under the thousand vicissitudes of a changeful\r\nand precarious life, and which, accompanying him in his old age,\r\nrendered his grey hairs less awfully reverend perhaps, but not less\r\nbeloved, than would a more grave and less imaginative expression of\r\ncountenance and character. There was even a penetrating shrewdness\r\nmingled in the look of curiosity, with which, as he stepped for an\r\ninstant aside, he seemed to watch the meeting of Mordaunt with the two\r\nlovely sisters.\r\n\r\nThe reception the youth met with resembled, in general character, that\r\nwhich he had experienced from Magnus himself; but the maidens could not\r\nso well cover their sense of the change of circumstances under which\r\nthey met. Both blushed, as, rising, and without extending the hand, far\r\nless offering the cheek, as the fashion of the times permitted, and\r\nalmost exacted, they paid to Mordaunt the salutation due to an ordinary\r\nacquaintance. But the blush of the elder was one of those transient\r\nevidences of flitting emotion, that vanish as fast as the passing\r\nthought which excites them. In an instant she stood before the youth\r\ncalm and cold, returning, with guarded and cautious courtesy, the usual\r\ncivilities, which, with a faltering voice, Mordaunt endeavoured to\r\npresent to her. The emotion of Brenda bore, externally at least, a\r\ndeeper and more agitating character. Her blush extended over every part\r\nof her beautiful skin which her dress permitted to be visible, including\r\nher slender neck, and the upper region of a finely formed bosom.\r\nNeither did she even attempt to reply to what share of his confused\r\ncompliment Mordaunt addressed to her in particular, but regarded him\r\nwith eyes, in which displeasure was evidently mingled with feelings of\r\nregret, and recollections of former times. Mordaunt felt, as it were,\r\nassured upon the instant, that the regard of Minna was extinguished, but\r\nthat it might be yet possible to recover that of the milder Brenda; and\r\nsuch is the waywardness of human fancy, that though he had never\r\nhitherto made any distinct difference betwixt these two beautiful and\r\ninteresting girls, the favour of her, which seemed most absolutely\r\nwithdrawn, became at the moment the most interesting in his eyes.\r\n\r\nHe was disturbed in these hasty reflections by Cleveland, who advanced,\r\nwith military frankness, to pay his compliments to his preserver, having\r\nonly delayed long enough to permit the exchange of the ordinary\r\nsalutation betwixt the visitor and the ladies of the family. He made his\r\napproach with so good a grace, that it was impossible for Mordaunt,\r\nalthough he dated his loss of favour at Burgh-Westra from this\r\nstranger's appearance on the coast, and domestication in the family, to\r\ndo less than return his advances as courtesy demanded, accept his thanks\r\nwith an appearance of satisfaction, and hope that his time had past\r\npleasantly since their last meeting.\r\n\r\nCleveland was about to answer, when he was anticipated by the little old\r\nman, formerly noticed, who now thrusting himself forward, and seizing\r\nMordaunt's hand, kissed him on the forehead; and then at the same time\r\nechoed and answered his question--\"How passes time at Burgh-Westra? Was\r\nit you that asked it, my prince of the cliff and of the scaur? How\r\nshould it pass, but with all the wings that beauty and joy can add to\r\nhelp its flight!\"\r\n\r\n\"And wit and song, too, my good old friend,\" said Mordaunt,\r\nhalf-serious, half-jesting, as he shook the old man cordially by the\r\nhand.--\"These cannot be wanting, where Claud Halcro comes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Jeer me not, Mordaunt, my good lad,\" replied the old man; \"When your\r\nfoot is as slow as mine, your wit frozen, and your song out of tune\"----\r\n\r\n\"How can you belie yourself, my good master?\" answered Mordaunt, who was\r\nnot unwilling to avail himself of his old friend's peculiarities to\r\nintroduce something like conversation, break the awkwardness of this\r\nsingular meeting, and gain time for observation, ere requiring an\r\nexplanation of the change of conduct which the family seemed to have\r\nadopted towards him. \"Say not so,\" he continued. \"Time, my old friend,\r\nlays his hand lightly on the bard. Have I not heard you say, the poet\r\npartakes the immortality of his song? and surely the great English poet,\r\nyou used to tell us of, was elder than yourself when he pulled the\r\nbow-oar among all the wits of London.\"\r\n\r\nThis alluded to a story which was, as the French term it, Halcro's\r\n_cheval de bataille_, and any allusion to which was certain at once to\r\nplace him in the saddle, and to push his hobby-horse into full career.\r\n\r\nHis laughing eye kindled with a sort of enthusiasm, which the ordinary\r\nfolk of this world might have called crazed, while he dashed into the\r\nsubject which he best loved to talk upon. \"Alas, alas, my dear Mordaunt\r\nMertoun--silver is silver, and waxes not dim by use--and pewter is\r\npewter, and grows the longer the duller. It is not for poor Claud Halcro\r\nto name himself in the same twelvemonth with the immortal John Dryden.\r\nTrue it is, as I may have told you before, that I have seen that great\r\nman, nay I have been in the Wits' Coffeehouse, as it was then called,\r\nand had once a pinch out of his own very snuff-box. I must have told you\r\nall how it happened, but here is Captain Cleveland who never heard\r\nit.--I lodged, you must know, in Russel Street--I question not but you\r\nknow Russel Street, Covent Garden, Captain Cleveland?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should know its latitude pretty well, Mr. Halcro,\" said the Captain,\r\nsmiling; \"but I believe you mentioned the circumstance yesterday, and\r\nbesides we have the day's duty in hand--you must play us this song which\r\nwe are to study.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will not serve the turn now,\" said Halcro, \"we must think of\r\nsomething that will take in our dear Mordaunt, the first voice in the\r\nisland, whether for a part or solo. I will never be he will touch a\r\nstring to you, unless Mordaunt Mertoun is to help us out.--What say you,\r\nmy fairest Night?--what think you, my sweet Dawn of Day?\" he added,\r\naddressing the young women, upon whom, as we have said elsewhere, he had\r\nlong before bestowed these allegorical names.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Mordaunt Mertoun,\" said Minna, \"has come too late to be of our band\r\non this occasion--it is our misfortune, but it cannot be helped.\"\r\n\r\n\"How? what?\" said Halcro, hastily--\"too late--and you have practised\r\ntogether all your lives? take my word, my bonny lasses, that old tunes\r\nare sweetest, and old friends surest. Mr. Cleveland has a fine bass,\r\nthat must be allowed; but I would have you trust for the first effect to\r\none of the twenty fine airs you can sing where Mordaunt's tenor joins so\r\nwell with your own witchery--here is my lovely Day approves of the\r\nchange in her heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were never in your life more mistaken, father Halcro,\" said Brenda,\r\nher cheeks again reddening, more with displeasure, it seemed, than with\r\nshame.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, but how is this?\" said the old man, pausing, and looking at them\r\nalternately. \"What have we got here?--a cloudy night and a red\r\nmorning?--that betokens rough weather.--What means all this, young\r\nwomen?--where lies the offence?--In me, I fear; for the blame is always\r\nlaid upon the oldest when young folk like you go by the ears.\"\r\n\r\n\"The blame is not with you, father Halcro,\" said Minna, rising, and\r\ntaking her sister by the arm, \"if indeed there be blame anywhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should fear then, Minna,\" said Mordaunt, endeavouring to soften his\r\ntone into one of indifferent pleasantry, \"that the new comer has brought\r\nthe offence along with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"When no offence is taken,\" replied Minna, with her usual gravity, \"it\r\nmatters not by whom such may have been offered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible, Minna!\" exclaimed Mordaunt, \"and is it you who speak\r\nthus to me?--And you too, Brenda, can you too judge so hardly of me, yet\r\nwithout permitting me one moment of honest and frank explanation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those who should know best,\" answered Brenda, in a low but decisive\r\ntone of voice, \"have told us their pleasure, and it must be\r\ndone.--Sister, I think we have staid too long here, and shall be wanted\r\nelsewhere--Mr. Mertoun will excuse us on so busy a day.\"\r\n\r\nThe sisters linked their arms together. Halcro in vain endeavoured to\r\nstop them, making, at the same time, a theatrical gesture, and\r\nexclaiming,\r\n\r\n  \"Now, Day and Night, but this is wondrous strange!\"\r\n\r\nThen turned to Mordaunt Mertoun, and added--\"The girls are possessed\r\nwith the spirit of mutability, showing, as our master Spenser well\r\nsaith, that\r\n\r\n  'Among all living creatures, more or lesse,\r\n  Change still doth reign, and keep the greater sway.'\r\n\r\nCaptain Cleveland,\" he continued, \"know you any thing that has happened\r\nto put these two juvenile Graces out of tune?\"\r\n\r\n\"He will lose his reckoning,\" answered Cleveland, \"that spends time in\r\nenquiring why the wind shifts a point, or why a woman changes her mind.\r\nWere I Mr. Mordaunt, I would not ask the proud wenches another question\r\non such a subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a friendly advice, Captain Cleveland,\" replied Mordaunt, \"and I\r\nwill not hold it the less so that it has been given unasked. Allow me to\r\nenquire if you are yourself as indifferent to the opinion of your female\r\nfriends, as it seems you would have me to be?\"\r\n\r\n\"Who, I?\" said the Captain, with an air of frank indifference, \"I never\r\nthought twice upon such a subject. I never saw a woman worth thinking\r\ntwice about after the anchor was a-peak--on shore it is another thing;\r\nand I will laugh, sing, dance, and make love, if they like it, with\r\ntwenty girls, were they but half so pretty as those who have left us,\r\nand make them heartily welcome to change their course in the sound of a\r\nboatswain's whistle. It will be odds but I wear as fast as they can.\"\r\n\r\nA patient is seldom pleased with that sort of consolation which is\r\nfounded on holding light the malady of which he complains; and Mordaunt\r\nfelt disposed to be offended with Captain Cleveland, both for taking\r\nnotice of his embarrassment, and intruding upon him his own opinion; and\r\nhe replied, therefore, somewhat sharply, \"that Captain Cleveland's\r\nsentiments were only suited to such as had the art to become universal\r\nfavourites wherever chance happened to throw them, and who could not\r\nlose in one place more than their merit was sure to gain for them in\r\nanother.\"\r\n\r\nThis was spoken ironically; but there was, to confess the truth, a\r\nsuperior knowledge of the world, and a consciousness of external merit\r\nat least, about the man, which rendered his interference doubly\r\ndisagreeable. As Sir Lucius O'Trigger says, there was an air of success\r\nabout Captain Cleveland which was mighty provoking. Young, handsome, and\r\nwell assured, his air of nautical bluntness sat naturally and easily\r\nupon him, and was perhaps particularly well fitted to the simple manners\r\nof the remote country in which he found himself; and where, even in the\r\nbest families, a greater degree of refinement might have rendered his\r\nconversation rather less acceptable. He was contented, in the present\r\ninstance, to smile good-humouredly at the obvious discontent of Mordaunt\r\nMertoun, and replied, \"You are angry with me, my good friend, but you\r\ncannot make me angry with you. The fair hands of all the pretty women I\r\never saw in my life would never have fished me up out of the Roost of\r\nSumburgh. So, pray, do not quarrel with me; for here is Mr. Halcro\r\nwitness that I have struck both jack and topsail, and should you fire a\r\nbroadside into me, cannot return a single shot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay,\" said Halcro, \"you must be friends with Captain Cleveland,\r\nMordaunt. Never quarrel with your friend, because a woman is whimsical.\r\nWhy, man, if they kept one humour, how the devil could we make so many\r\nsongs on them as we do? Even old Dryden himself, glorious old John,\r\ncould have said little about a girl that was always of one mind--as well\r\nwrite verses upon a mill-pond. It is your tides and your roosts, and\r\nyour currents and eddies, that come and go, and ebb and flow, (by\r\nHeaven! I run into rhyme when I so much as think upon them,) that smile\r\none day, rage the next, flatter and devour, delight and ruin us, and so\r\nforth--it is these that give the real soul of poetry. Did you never hear\r\nmy Adieu to the Lass of Northmaven--that was poor Bet Stimbister, whom I\r\ncall Mary for the sound's sake, as I call myself Hacon after my great\r\nancestor Hacon Goldemund, or Haco with the golden mouth, who came to the\r\nisland with Harold Harfager, and was his chief Scald?--Well, but where\r\nwas I?--O ay--poor Bet Stimbister, she (and partly some debt) was the\r\ncause of my leaving the isles of Hialtland, (better so called than\r\nShetland, or Zetland even,) and taking to the broad world. I have had a\r\ntramp of it since that time--I have battled my way through the world,\r\nCaptain, as a man of mold may, that has a light head, a light purse, and\r\na heart as light as them both--fought my way, and paid my way--that is,\r\neither with money or wit--have seen kings changed and deposed as you\r\nwould turn a tenant out of a scathold--knew all the wits of the age, and\r\nespecially the glorious John Dryden--what man in the islands can say as\r\nmuch, barring lying?--I had a pinch out of his own snuff-box--I will\r\ntell you how I came by such promotion.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the song, Mr. Halcro,\" said Captain Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\"The song?\" answered Halcro, seizing the Captain by the button,--for he\r\nwas too much accustomed to have his audience escape from him during\r\nrecitation, not to put in practice all the usual means of\r\nprevention,--\"The song? Why I gave a copy of it, with fifteen others, to\r\nthe immortal John. You shall hear it--you shall hear them all, if you\r\nwill but stand still a moment; and you too, my dear boy, Mordaunt\r\nMertoun, I have scarce heard a word from your mouth these six months,\r\nand now you are running away from me.\" So saying, he secured him with\r\nhis other hand.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, now he has got us both in tow,\" said the seaman, \"there is nothing\r\nfor it but hearing him out, though he spins as tough a yarn as ever an\r\nold man-of-war's-man twisted on the watch at midnight.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, now, be silent, be silent, and let one of us speak at once,\" said\r\nthe poet, imperatively; while Cleveland and Mordaunt, looking at each\r\nother with a ludicrous expression of resignation to their fate, waited\r\nin submission for the well-known and inevitable tale. \"I will tell you\r\nall about it,\" continued Halcro. \"I was knocked about the world like\r\nother young fellows, doing this, that, and t'other for a livelihood;\r\nfor, thank God, I could turn my hand to any thing--but loving still the\r\nMuses as much as if the ungrateful jades had found me, like so many\r\nblockheads, in my own coach and six. However, I held out till my cousin,\r\nold Lawrence Linkletter, died, and left me the bit of an island yonder;\r\nalthough, by the way, Cultmalindie was as near to him as I was; but\r\nLawrence loved wit, though he had little of his own. Well, he left me\r\nthe wee bit island--it is as barren as Parnassus itself. What then?--I\r\nhave a penny to spend, a penny to keep my purse, a penny to give to the\r\npoor--ay, and a bed and a bottle for a friend, as you shall know, boys,\r\nif you will go back with me when this merriment is over.--But where was\r\nI in my story?\"\r\n\r\n\"Near port, I hope,\" answered Cleveland; but Halcro was too determined a\r\nnarrator to be interrupted by the broadest hint.\r\n\r\n\"O ay,\" he resumed, with the self-satisfied air of one who has recovered\r\nthe thread of a story, \"I was in my old lodgings in Russel Street, with\r\nold Timothy Thimblethwaite, the Master Fashioner, then the best-known\r\nman about town. He made for all the wits, and for the dull boobies of\r\nfortune besides, and made the one pay for the other. He never denied a\r\nwit credit save in jest, or for the sake of getting a repartee; and he\r\nwas in correspondence with all that was worth knowing about town. He had\r\nletters from Crowne, and Tate, and Prior, and Tom Brown, and all the\r\nfamous fellows of the time, with such pellets of wit, that there was no\r\nreading them without laughing ready to die, and all ending with craving\r\na further term for payment.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should have thought the tailor would have found that jest rather\r\nserious,\" said Mordaunt.\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit--not a bit,\" replied his eulogist, \"Tim Thimblethwaite (he\r\nwas a Cumberland-man by birth) had the soul of a prince--ay, and died\r\nwith the fortune of one; for woe betide the custard-gorged alderman that\r\ncame under Tim's goose, after he had got one of those letters--egad, he\r\nwas sure to pay the kain! Why, Thimblethwaite was thought to be the\r\noriginal of little Tom Bibber, in glorious John's comedy of the Wild\r\nGallant; and I know that he has trusted, ay, and lent John money to boot\r\nout of his own pocket, at a time when all his fine court friends blew\r\ncold enough. He trusted me too, and I have been two months on the score\r\nat a time for my upper room. To be sure, I was obliging in his way--not\r\nthat I exactly could shape or sew, nor would that have been decorous for\r\na gentleman of good descent; but I--eh, eh--I drew bills--summed up the\r\nbooks\"----\r\n\r\n\"Carried home the clothes of the wits and aldermen, and got lodging for\r\nyour labour?\" interrupted Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\"No, no--damn it, no,\" replied Halcro; \"no such thing--you put me out in\r\nmy story--where was I?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, the devil help you to the latitude,\" said the Captain, extricating\r\nhis button from the gripe of the unmerciful bard's finger and thumb,\r\n\"for I have no time to take an observation.\" So saying, he bolted from\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n\"A silly, ill-bred, conceited fool,\" said Halcro, looking after him;\r\n\"with as little manners as wit in his empty coxcomb. I wonder what\r\nMagnus and these silly wenches can see in him--he tells such damnable\r\nlong-winded stories, too, about his adventures and sea-fights--every\r\nsecond word a lie, I doubt not. Mordaunt, my dear boy, take example by\r\nthat man--that is, take warning by him--never tell long stories about\r\nyourself. You are sometimes given to talk too much about your own\r\nexploits on crags and skerries, and the like, which only breaks\r\nconversation, and prevents other folk from being heard. Now I see you\r\nare impatient to hear out what I was saying--Stop, whereabouts was I?\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear we must put it off, Mr. Halcro, until after dinner,\" said\r\nMordaunt, who also meditated his escape, though desirous of effecting it\r\nwith more delicacy towards his old acquaintance than Captain Cleveland\r\nhad thought it necessary to use.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, my dear boy,\" said Halcro, seeing himself about to be utterly\r\ndeserted, \"do not you leave me too--never take so bad an example as to\r\nset light by old acquaintance, Mordaunt. I have wandered many a weary\r\nstep in my day; but they were always lightened when I could get hold of\r\nthe arm of an old friend like yourself.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he quitted the youth's coat, and sliding his hand gently\r\nunder his arm, grappled him more effectually; to which Mordaunt\r\nsubmitted, a little moved by the poet's observation upon the unkindness\r\nof old acquaintances, under which he himself was an immediate sufferer.\r\nBut when Halcro renewed his formidable question, \"Whereabouts was I?\"\r\nMordaunt, preferring his poetry to his prose, reminded him of the song\r\nwhich he said he had written upon his first leaving Zetland,--a song to\r\nwhich, indeed, the enquirer was no stranger, but which, as it must be\r\nnew to the reader, we shall here insert as a favourable specimen of the\r\npoetical powers of this tuneful descendant of Haco the Golden-mouthed;\r\nfor, in the opinion of many tolerable judges, he held a respectable rank\r\namong the inditers of madrigals of the period, and was as well qualified\r\nto give immortality to his Nancies of the hills or dales, as many a\r\ngentle sonnetteer of wit and pleasure about town. He was something of a\r\nmusician also, and on the present occasion seized upon a sort of lute,\r\nand, quitting his victim, prepared the instrument for an accompaniment,\r\nspeaking all the while that he might lose no time.\r\n\r\n\"I learned the lute,\" he said, \"from the same man who taught honest\r\nShadwell--plump Tom, as they used to call him--somewhat roughly treated\r\nby the glorious John, you remember--Mordaunt, you remember--\r\n\r\n  'Methinks I see the new Arion sail,\r\n  The lute still trembling underneath thy nail;\r\n  At thy well sharpen'd thumb, from shore to shore,\r\n  The trebles squeak for fear, the basses roar.'\r\n\r\nCome, I am indifferently in tune now--what was it to be?--ay, I\r\nremember--nay, The Lass of Northmaven is the ditty--poor Bet Stimbister!\r\nI have called her Mary in the verses. Betsy does well for an English\r\nsong; but Mary is more natural here.\" So saying, after a short prelude,\r\nhe sung, with a tolerable voice and some taste, the following verses:\r\n\r\n\r\nMARY.\r\n\r\n  Farewell to Northmaven,\r\n    Grey Hillswicke, farewell!\r\n  To the calms of thy haven,\r\n    The storms on thy fell--\r\n  To each breeze that can vary\r\n    The mood of thy main,\r\n  And to thee, bonny Mary!\r\n    We meet not again.\r\n\r\n  Farewell the wild ferry,\r\n    Which Hacon could brave,\r\n  When the peaks of the Skerry\r\n    Were white in the wave.\r\n  There's a maid may look over\r\n    These wild waves in vain--\r\n  For the skiff of her lover--\r\n    He comes not again.\r\n\r\n  The vows thou hast broke,\r\n    On the wild currents fling them;\r\n  On the quicksand and rock\r\n    Let the mermaidens sing them.\r\n  New sweetness they'll give her\r\n    Bewildering strain;\r\n  But there's one who will never\r\n    Believe them again.\r\n\r\n  O were there an island,\r\n    Though ever so wild,\r\n  Where woman could smile, and\r\n    No man be beguiled--\r\n  Too tempting a snare\r\n    To poor mortals were given,\r\n  And the hope would fix there,\r\n    That should anchor on heaven!\r\n\r\n\"I see you are softened, my young friend,\" said Halcro, when he had\r\nfinished his song; \"so are most who hear that same ditty. Words and\r\nmusic both mine own; and, without saying much of the wit of it, there is\r\na sort of eh--eh--simplicity and truth about it, which gets its way to\r\nmost folk's heart. Even your father cannot resist it--and he has a heart\r\nas impenetrable to poetry and song as Apollo himself could draw an arrow\r\nagainst. But then he has had some ill luck in his time with the\r\nwomen-folk, as is plain from his owing them such a grudge--Ay, ay, there\r\nthe charm lies--none of us but has felt the same sore in our day. But\r\ncome, my dear boy, they are mustering in the hall, men and women\r\nboth--plagues as they are, we should get on ill without them--but\r\nbefore we go, only mark the last turn--\r\n\r\n  'And the hope would fix there,'--\r\n\r\nthat is, in the supposed island--a place which neither was nor will be--\r\n\r\n  'That should anchor on heaven.'\r\n\r\nNow you see, my good young man, there are here none of your heathenish\r\nrants, which Rochester, Etheridge, and these wild fellows, used to\r\nstring together. A parson might sing the song, and his clerk bear the\r\nburden--but there is the confounded bell--we must go now--but never\r\nmind--we'll get into a quiet corner at night, and I'll tell you all\r\nabout it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n  Full in the midst the polish'd table shines,\r\n  And the bright goblets, rich with generous wines;\r\n  Now each partakes the feast, the wine prepares,\r\n  Portions the food, and each the portion shares;\r\n  Nor till the rage of thirst and hunger ceased,\r\n  To the high host approach'd the sagacious guest.\r\n\r\n                                                  _Odyssey._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe hospitable profusion of Magnus Troil's board, the number of guests\r\nwho feasted in the hall, the much greater number of retainers,\r\nattendants, humble friends, and domestics of every possible description,\r\nwho revelled without, with the multitude of the still poorer, and less\r\nhonoured assistants, who came from every hamlet or township within\r\ntwenty miles round, to share the bounty of the munificent Udaller, were\r\nsuch as altogether astonished Triptolemus Yellowley, and made him\r\ninternally doubt whether it would be prudent in him at this time, and\r\namid the full glow of his hospitality, to propose to the host who\r\npresided over such a splendid banquet, a radical change in the whole\r\ncustoms and usages of his country.\r\n\r\nTrue, the sagacious Triptolemus felt conscious that he possessed in his\r\nown person wisdom far superior to that of all the assembled feasters, to\r\nsay nothing of the landlord, against whose prudence the very extent of\r\nhis hospitality formed, in Yellowley's opinion, sufficient evidence. But\r\nyet the Amphitryon with whom one dines, holds, for the time at least,\r\nan influence over the minds of his most distinguished guests; and if the\r\ndinner be in good style and the wines of the right quality, it is\r\nhumbling to see that neither art nor wisdom, scarce external rank\r\nitself, can assume their natural and wonted superiority over the\r\ndistributor of these good things, until coffee has been brought in.\r\nTriptolemus felt the full weight of this temporary superiority, yet he\r\nwas desirous to do something that might vindicate the vaunts he had made\r\nto his sister and his fellow-traveller, and he stole a look at them from\r\ntime to time, to mark whether he was not sinking in their esteem from\r\npostponing his promised lecture on the enormities of Zetland.\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Barbara was busily engaged in noting and registering the waste\r\nincurred in such an entertainment as she had probably never before\r\nlooked upon, and in admiring the host's indifference to, and the guests'\r\nabsolute negligence of, those rules of civility in which her youth had\r\nbeen brought up. The feasters desired to be helped from a dish which was\r\nunbroken, and might have figured at supper, with as much freedom as if\r\nit had undergone the ravages of half-a-dozen guests; and no one seemed\r\nto care--the landlord himself least of all--whether those dishes only\r\nwere consumed, which, from their nature, were incapable of\r\nre-appearance, or whether the assault was extended to the substantial\r\nrounds of beef, pasties, and so forth, which, by the rules of good\r\nhousewifery, were destined to stand two attacks, and which, therefore,\r\naccording to Mrs. Barbara's ideas of politeness, ought not to have been\r\nannihilated by the guests upon the first onset, but spared, like Outis\r\nin the cave of Polyphemus, to be devoured the last. Lost in the\r\nmeditations to which these breaches of convivial discipline gave rise,\r\nand in the contemplation of an ideal larder of cold meat which she could\r\nhave saved out of the wreck of roast, boiled, and baked, sufficient to\r\nhave supplied her cupboard for at least a twelvemonth, Mrs. Barbara\r\ncared very little whether or not her brother supported in its extent the\r\ncharacter which he had calculated upon assuming.\r\n\r\nMordaunt Mertoun also was conversant with far other thoughts, than those\r\nwhich regarded the proposed reformer of Zetland enormities. His seat was\r\nbetwixt two blithe maidens of Thule, who, not taking scorn that he had\r\nupon other occasions given preference to the daughters of the Udaller,\r\nwere glad of the chance which assigned to them the attentions of so\r\ndistinguished a gallant, who, as being their squire at the feast, might\r\nin all probability become their partner in the subsequent dance. But,\r\nwhilst rendering to his fair neighbours all the usual attentions which\r\nsociety required, Mordaunt kept up a covert, but accurate and close\r\nobservation, upon his estranged friends, Minna and Brenda. The Udaller\r\nhimself had a share of his attention; but in him he could remark\r\nnothing, except the usual tone of hearty and somewhat boisterous\r\nhospitality, with which he was accustomed to animate the banquet upon\r\nall such occasions of general festivity. But in the differing mien of\r\nthe two maidens there was much more room for painful remark.\r\n\r\nCaptain Cleveland sat betwixt the sisters, was sedulous in his\r\nattentions to both, and Mordaunt was so placed, that he could observe\r\nall, and hear a great deal, of what passed between them. But Cleveland's\r\npeculiar regard seemed devoted to the elder sister. Of this the younger\r\nwas perhaps conscious, for more than once her eye glanced towards\r\nMordaunt, and, as he thought, with something in it which resembled\r\nregret for the interruption of their intercourse, and a sad remembrance\r\nof former and more friendly times; while Minna was exclusively engrossed\r\nby the attentions of her neighbour; and that it should be so, filled\r\nMordaunt with surprise and resentment.\r\n\r\nMinna, the serious, the prudent, the reserved, whose countenance and\r\nmanners indicated so much elevation of character--Minna, the lover of\r\nsolitude, and of those paths of knowledge in which men walk best without\r\ncompany--the enemy of light mirth, the friend of musing melancholy, and\r\nthe frequenter of fountain-heads and pathless glens--she whose character\r\nseemed, in short, the very reverse of that which might be captivated by\r\nthe bold, coarse, and daring gallantry of such a man as this Captain\r\nCleveland, gave, nevertheless, her eye and ear to him, as he sat beside\r\nher at table, with an interest and a graciousness of attention, which,\r\nto Mordaunt, who well knew how to judge of her feelings by her manner,\r\nintimated a degree of the highest favour. He observed this, and his\r\nheart rose against the favourite by whom he had been thus superseded, as\r\nwell as against Minna's indiscreet departure from her own character.\r\n\r\n\"What is there about the man,\" he said within himself, \"more than the\r\nbold and daring assumption of importance which is derived from success\r\nin petty enterprises, and the exercise of petty despotism over a ship's\r\ncrew?--His very language is more professional than is used by the\r\nsuperior officers of the British navy; and the wit which has excited so\r\nmany smiles, seems to me such as Minna would not formerly have endured\r\nfor an instant. Even Brenda seems less taken with his gallantry than\r\nMinna, whom it should have suited so little.\"\r\n\r\nMordaunt was doubly mistaken in these his angry speculations. In the\r\nfirst place, with an eye which was, in some respects, that of a rival,\r\nhe criticised far too severely the manners and behaviour of Captain\r\nCleveland. They were unpolished, certainly; which was of the less\r\nconsequence in a country inhabited by so plain and simple a race as the\r\nancient Zetlanders. On the other hand, there was an open, naval\r\nfrankness in Cleveland's bearing--much natural shrewdness--some\r\nappropriate humour--an undoubting confidence in himself--and that\r\nenterprising hardihood of disposition, which, without any other\r\nrecommendable quality, very often leads to success with the fair sex.\r\nBut Mordaunt was farther mistaken, in supposing that Cleveland was\r\nlikely to be disagreeable to Minna Troil, on account of the opposition\r\nof their characters in so many material particulars. Had his knowledge\r\nof the world been a little more extensive, he might have observed, that\r\nas unions are often formed betwixt couples differing in complexion and\r\nstature, they take place still more frequently betwixt persons totally\r\ndiffering in feelings, in taste, in pursuits, and in understanding; and\r\nit would not be saying, perhaps, too much, to aver, that two-thirds of\r\nthe marriages around us have been contracted betwixt persons, who,\r\njudging _a priori_, we should have thought had scarce any charms for\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nA moral and primary cause might be easily assigned for these anomalies,\r\nin the wise dispensations of Providence, that the general balance of\r\nwit, wisdom, and amiable qualities of all kinds, should be kept up\r\nthrough society at large. For, what a world were it, if the wise were to\r\nintermarry only with the wise, the learned with the learned, the amiable\r\nwith the amiable, nay, even the handsome with the handsome? and, is it\r\nnot evident, that the degraded castes of the foolish, the ignorant, the\r\nbrutal, and the deformed, (comprehending, by the way, far the greater\r\nportion of mankind,) must, when condemned to exclusive intercourse with\r\neach other, become gradually as much brutalized in person and\r\ndisposition as so many ourang-outangs? When, therefore, we see the\r\n\"gentle joined to the rude,\" we may lament the fate of the suffering\r\nindividual, but we must not the less admire the mysterious disposition\r\nof that wise Providence which thus balances the moral good and evil of\r\nlife;--which secures for a family, unhappy in the dispositions of one\r\nparent, a share of better and sweeter blood, transmitted from the other,\r\nand preserves to the offspring the affectionate care and protection of\r\nat least one of those from whom it is naturally due. Without the\r\nfrequent occurrence of such alliances and unions--mis-sorted as they\r\nseem at first sight--the world could not be that for which Eternal\r\nWisdom has designed it--a place of mixed good and evil--a place of trial\r\nat once, and of suffering, where even the worst ills are checkered with\r\nsomething that renders them tolerable to humble and patient minds, and\r\nwhere the best blessings carry with them a necessary alloy of\r\nembittering depreciation.\r\n\r\nWhen, indeed, we look a little closer on the causes of those unexpected\r\nand ill-suited attachments, we have occasion to acknowledge, that the\r\nmeans by which they are produced do not infer that complete departure\r\nfrom, or inconsistency with, the character of the parties, which we\r\nmight expect when the result alone is contemplated. The wise purposes\r\nwhich Providence appears to have had in view, by permitting such\r\nintermixture of dispositions, tempers, and understandings, in the\r\nmarried state, are not accomplished by any mysterious impulse by which,\r\nin contradiction to the ordinary laws of nature, men or women are urged\r\nto an union with those whom the world see to be unsuitable to them. The\r\nfreedom of will is permitted to us in the occurrences of ordinary life,\r\nas in our moral conduct; and in the former as well as the latter case,\r\nis often the means of misguiding those who possess it. Thus it usually\r\nhappens, more especially to the enthusiastic and imaginative, that,\r\nhaving formed a picture of admiration in their own mind, they too often\r\ndeceive themselves by some faint resemblance in some existing being,\r\nwhom their fancy, as speedily as gratuitously, invests with all the\r\nattributes necessary to complete the _beau ideal_ of mental perfection.\r\nNo one, perhaps, even in the happiest marriage, with an object really\r\nbeloved, ever discovered by experience all the qualities he expected to\r\npossess; but in far too many cases, he finds he has practised a much\r\nhigher degree of mental deception, and has erected his airy castle of\r\nfelicity upon some rainbow, which owed its very existence only to the\r\npeculiar state of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nThus, Mordaunt, if better acquainted with life, and with the course of\r\nhuman things, would have been little surprised that such a man as\r\nCleveland, handsome, bold, and animated,--a man who had obviously lived\r\nin danger, and who spoke of it as sport, should have been invested, by a\r\ngirl of Minna's fanciful disposition, with an extensive share of those\r\nqualities, which, in her active imagination, were held to fill up the\r\naccomplishments of a heroic character. The plain bluntness of his\r\nmanner, if remote from courtesy, appeared at least as widely different\r\nfrom deceit; and, unfashioned as he seemed by forms, he had enough both\r\nof natural sense, and natural good-breeding, to support the delusion he\r\nhad created, at least as far as externals were concerned. It is scarce\r\nnecessary to add, that these observations apply exclusively to what are\r\ncalled love-matches; for when either party fix their attachment upon the\r\nsubstantial comforts of a rental, or a jointure, they cannot be\r\ndisappointed in the acquisition, although they may be cruelly so in\r\ntheir over-estimation of the happiness it was to afford, or in having\r\ntoo slightly anticipated the disadvantages with which it was to be\r\nattended.\r\n\r\nHaving a certain partiality for the dark Beauty whom we have described,\r\nwe have willingly dedicated this digression, in order to account for a\r\nline of conduct which we allow to seem absolutely unnatural in such a\r\nnarrative as the present, though the most common event in ordinary life;\r\nnamely, in Minna's appearing to have over-estimated the taste, talent,\r\nand ability of a handsome young man, who was dedicating to her his whole\r\ntime and attention, and whose homage rendered her the envy of almost all\r\nthe other young women of that numerous party. Perhaps, if our fair\r\nreaders will take the trouble to consult their own bosoms, they will be\r\ndisposed to allow, that the distinguished good taste exhibited by any\r\nindividual, who, when his attentions would be agreeable to a whole\r\ncircle of rivals, selects _one_ as their individual object, entitles\r\nhim, on the footing of reciprocity, if on no other, to a large share of\r\nthat individual's favourable, and even partial, esteem. At any rate, if\r\nthe character shall, after all, be deemed inconsistent and unnatural, it\r\nconcerns not us, who record the facts as we find them, and pretend no\r\nprivilege for bringing closer to nature those incidents which may seem\r\nto diverge from it; or for reducing to consistence that most\r\ninconsistent of all created things--the heart of a beautiful and admired\r\nfemale.\r\n\r\nNecessity, which teaches all the liberal arts, can render us also adepts\r\nin dissimulation; and Mordaunt, though a novice, failed not to profit in\r\nher school. It was manifest, that, in order to observe the demeanour of\r\nthose on whom his attention was fixed, he must needs put constraint on\r\nhis own, and appear, at least, so much engaged with the damsels betwixt\r\nwhom he sat, that Minna and Brenda should suppose him indifferent to\r\nwhat was passing around him. The ready cheerfulness of Maddie and Clara\r\nGroatsettars, who were esteemed considerable fortunes in the island, and\r\nwere at this moment too happy in feeling themselves seated somewhat\r\nbeyond the sphere of vigilance influenced by their aunt, the good old\r\nLady Glowrowrum, met and requited the attempts which Mordaunt made to be\r\nlively and entertaining; and they were soon engaged in a gay\r\nconversation, to which, as usual on such occasions, the gentleman\r\ncontributed wit, or what passes for such, and the ladies their prompt\r\nlaughter and liberal applause. But, amidst this seeming mirth, Mordaunt\r\nfailed not, from time to time, as covertly as he might, to observe the\r\nconduct of the two daughters of Magnus; and still it appeared as if the\r\nelder, wrapt up in the conversation of Cleveland, did not cast away a\r\nthought on the rest of the company; and as if Brenda, more openly as she\r\nconceived his attention withdrawn from her, looked with an expression\r\nboth anxious and melancholy towards the group of which he himself formed\r\na part. He was much moved by the diffidence, as well as the trouble,\r\nwhich her looks seemed to convey, and tacitly formed the resolution of\r\nseeking a more full explanation with her in the course of the evening.\r\nNorna, he remembered, had stated that these two amiable young women were\r\nin danger, the nature of which she left unexplained, but which he\r\nsuspected to arise out of their mistaking the character of this daring\r\nand all-engrossing stranger; and he secretly resolved, that, if\r\npossible, he would be the means of detecting Cleveland, and of saving\r\nhis early friends.\r\n\r\nAs he revolved these thoughts, his attention to the Miss Groatsettars\r\ngradually diminished, and perhaps he might altogether have forgotten the\r\nnecessity of his appearing an uninterested spectator of what was\r\npassing, had not the signal been given for the ladies retiring from\r\ntable. Minna, with a native grace, and somewhat of stateliness in her\r\nmanner, bent her head to the company in general, with a kinder and more\r\nparticular expression as her eye reached Cleveland. Brenda, with the\r\nblush which attended her slightest personal exertion when exposed to the\r\neyes of others, hurried through the same departing salutation with an\r\nembarrassment which almost amounted to awkwardness, but which her youth\r\nand timidity rendered at once natural and interesting. Again Mordaunt\r\nthought that her eye distinguished him amidst the numerous company. For\r\nthe first time he ventured to encounter and to return the glance; and\r\nthe consciousness that he had done so doubled the glow of Brenda's\r\ncountenance, while something resembling displeasure was blended with her\r\nemotion.\r\n\r\nWhen the ladies had retired, the men betook themselves to the deep and\r\nserious drinking, which, according to the fashion of the times, preceded\r\nthe evening exercise of the dance. Old Magnus himself, by precept and\r\nexample, exhorted them \"to make the best use of their time, since the\r\nladies would soon summon them to shake their feet.\" At the same time\r\ngiving the signal to a grey-headed domestic, who stood behind him in the\r\ndress of a Dantzic skipper, and who added to many other occupations that\r\nof butler, \"Eric Scambester,\" he said, \"has the good ship the Jolly\r\nMariner of Canton, got her cargo on board?\"\r\n\r\n\"Chokeful loaded,\" answered the Ganymede of Burgh-Westra, \"with good\r\nNantz, Jamaica sugar, Portugal lemons, not to mention nutmeg and toast,\r\nand water taken in from the Shellicoat spring.\"\r\n\r\nLoud and long laughed the guests at this stated and regular jest betwixt\r\nthe Udaller and his butler, which always served as a preface to the\r\nintroduction of a punch-bowl of enormous size, the gift of the captain\r\nof one of the Honourable East India Company's vessels, which, bound from\r\nChina homeward, had been driven north-about by stress of weather into\r\nLerwick-bay, and had there contrived to get rid of part of the cargo,\r\nwithout very scrupulously reckoning for the King's duties.\r\n\r\nMagnus Troil, having been a large customer, besides otherwise obliging\r\nCaptain Coolie, had been remunerated, on the departure of the ship, with\r\nthis splendid vehicle of conviviality, at the very sight of which, as\r\nold Eric Scambester bent under its weight, a murmur of applause ran\r\nthrough the company. The good old toasts dedicated to the prosperity of\r\nZetland, were then honoured with flowing bumpers. \"Death to the head\r\nthat never wears hair!\" was a sentiment quaffed to the success of the\r\nfishing, as proposed by the sonorous voice of the Udaller. Claud Halcro\r\nproposed with general applause, \"The health of their worthy landmaster,\r\nthe sweet sister meat-mistresses; health to man, death to fish, and\r\ngrowth to the produce of the ground.\" The same recurring sentiment was\r\nproposed more concisely by a whiteheaded compeer of Magnus Troil, in the\r\nwords, \"God open the mouth of the grey fish, and keep his hand about the\r\ncorn!\"[40]\r\n\r\nFull opportunity was afforded to all to honour these interesting toasts.\r\nThose nearest the capacious Mediterranean of punch, were accommodated by\r\nthe Udaller with their portions, dispensed in huge rummer glasses by his\r\nown hospitable hand, whilst they who sat at a greater distance\r\nreplenished their cups by means of a rich silver flagon, facetiously\r\ncalled the Pinnace; which, filled occasionally at the bowl, served to\r\ndispense its liquid treasures to the more remote parts of the table, and\r\noccasioned many right merry jests on its frequent voyages. The commerce\r\nof the Zetlanders with foreign vessels, and homeward-bound West\r\nIndiamen, had early served to introduce among them the general use of\r\nthe generous beverage, with which the Jolly Mariner of Canton was\r\nloaded; nor was there a man in the archipelago of Thule more skilled in\r\ncombining its rich ingredients, than old Eric Scambester, who indeed was\r\nknown far and wide through the isles by the name of the Punch-maker,\r\nafter the fashion of the ancient Norwegians, who conferred on Rollo the\r\nWalker, and other heroes of their strain, epithets expressive of the\r\nfeats of strength or dexterity in which they excelled all other men.\r\n\r\nThe good liquor was not slow in performing its office of exhilaration,\r\nand, as the revel advanced, some ancient Norse drinking-songs were sung\r\nwith great effect by the guests, tending to show, that if, from want of\r\nexercise, the martial virtues of their ancestors had decayed among the\r\nZetlanders, they could still actively and intensely enjoy so much of the\r\npleasures of Valhalla as consisted in quaffing the oceans of mead and\r\nbrown ale, which were promised by Odin to those who should share his\r\nScandinavian paradise. At length, excited by the cup and song, the\r\ndiffident grew bold, and the modest loquacious--all became desirous of\r\ntalking, and none were willing to listen--each man mounted his own\r\nspecial hobby-horse, and began eagerly to call on his neighbours to\r\nwitness his agility. Amongst others, the little bard, who had now got\r\nnext to our friend Mordaunt Mertoun, evinced a positive determination to\r\ncommence and conclude, in all its longitude and latitude, the story of\r\nhis introduction to glorious John Dryden; and Triptolemus Yellowley, as\r\nhis spirits arose, shaking off a feeling of involuntary awe, with which\r\nhe was impressed by the opulence indicated in all he saw around him, as\r\nwell as by the respect paid to Magnus Troil by the assembled guests,\r\nbegan to broach, to the astonished and somewhat offended Udaller, some\r\nof those projects for ameliorating the islands, which he had boasted of\r\nto his fellow-travellers upon their journey of the morning.\r\n\r\nBut the innovations which he suggested, and the reception which they met\r\nwith at the hand of Magnus Troil, must be told in the next Chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[40] See Hibbert's Description of the Zetland Islands, p. 470.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n  We'll keep our customs--what is law itself,\r\n  But old establish'd custom? What religion,\r\n  (I mean, with one-half of the men that use it,)\r\n  Save the good use and wont that carries them\r\n  To worship how and where their fathers worshipp'd?\r\n  All things resolve in custom--we'll keep ours.\r\n\r\n                                                 _Old Play._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe left the company of Magnus Troil engaged in high wassail and revelry.\r\nMordaunt, who, like his father, shunned the festive cup, did not partake\r\nin the cheerfulness which the ship diffused among the guests as they\r\nunloaded it, and the pinnace, as it circumnavigated the table. But, in\r\nlow spirits as he seemed, he was the more meet prey for the\r\nstory-telling Halcro, who had fixed upon him, as in a favourable state\r\nto play the part of listener, with something of the same instinct that\r\ndirects the hooded crow to the sick sheep among the flock, which will\r\nmost patiently suffer itself to be made a prey of. Joyfully did the poet\r\navail himself of the advantages afforded by Mordaunt's absence of mind,\r\nand unwillingness to exert himself in measures of active defence. With\r\nthe unfailing dexterity peculiar to prosers, he contrived to dribble out\r\nhis tale to double its usual length, by the exercise of the privilege of\r\nunlimited digressions; so that the story, like a horse on the _grand\r\npas_, seemed to be advancing with rapidity, while, in reality, it scarce\r\nwas progressive at the rate of a yard in the quarter of an hour. At\r\nlength, however, he had discussed, in all its various bearings and\r\nrelations, the history of his friendly landlord, the master fashioner in\r\nRussel Street, including a short sketch of five of his relations, and\r\nanecdotes of three of his principal rivals, together with some general\r\nobservations upon the dress and fashion of the period; and having\r\nmarched thus far through the environs and outworks of his story, he\r\narrived at the body of the place, for so the Wits' Coffeehouse might be\r\ntermed. He paused on the threshold, however, to explain the nature of\r\nhis landlord's right occasionally to intrude himself into this\r\nwell-known temple of the Muses.\r\n\r\n\"It consisted,\" said Halcro, \"in the two principal points, of bearing\r\nand forbearing; for my friend Thimblethwaite was a person of wit\r\nhimself, and never quarrelled with any jest which the wags who\r\nfrequented that house were flinging about, like squibs and crackers on a\r\nrejoicing night; and then, though some of the wits--ay, and I daresay\r\nthe greater number, might have had some dealings with him in the way of\r\ntrade, he never was the person to put any man of genius in unpleasant\r\nremembrance of such trifles. And though, my dear young Master Mordaunt,\r\nyou may think this is but ordinary civility, because in this country it\r\nhappens seldom that there is either much borrowing or lending, and\r\nbecause, praised be Heaven, there are neither bailiffs nor\r\nsheriff-officers to take a poor fellow by the neck, and because there\r\nare no prisons to put him into when they have done so, yet, let me tell\r\nyou, that such a lamblike forbearance as that of my poor, dear, deceased\r\nlandlord, Thimblethwaite, is truly uncommon within the London bills of\r\nmortality. I could tell you of such things that have happened even to\r\nmyself, as well as others, with these cursed London tradesmen, as would\r\nmake your hair stand on end.--But what the devil has put old Magnus into\r\nsuch note? he shouts as if he were trying his voice against a north-west\r\ngale of wind.\"\r\n\r\nLoud indeed was the roar of the old Udaller, as, worn out of patience by\r\nthe schemes of improvement which the factor was now undauntedly pressing\r\nupon his consideration, he answered him, (to use an Ossianic phrase,)\r\nlike a wave upon a rock,\r\n\r\n\"Trees, Sir Factor--talk not to me of trees! I care not though there\r\nnever be one on the island, tall enough to hang a coxcomb upon. We will\r\nhave no trees but those that rise in our havens--the good trees that\r\nhave yards for boughs, and standing-rigging for leaves.\"\r\n\r\n\"But touching the draining of the lake of Braebaster, whereof I spoke to\r\nyou, Master Magnus Troil,\" said the persevering agriculturist, \"whilk I\r\nopine would be of so much consequence, there are two ways--down the\r\nLinklater glen, or by the Scalmester burn. Now, having taken the level\r\nof both\"----\r\n\r\n\"There is a third way, Master Yellowley,\" answered the landlord.\r\n\r\n\"I profess I can see none,\" replied Triptolemus, with as much good faith\r\nas a joker could desire in the subject of his wit, \"in respect that the\r\nhill called Braebaster on the south, and ane high bank on the north, of\r\nwhilk I cannot carry the name rightly in my head\"----\r\n\r\n\"Do not tell us of hills and banks, Master Yellowley--there is a third\r\nway of draining the loch, and it is the only way that shall be tried in\r\nmy day. You say my Lord Chamberlain and I are the joint proprietors--so\r\nbe it--let each of us start an equal proportion of brandy, lime-juice,\r\nand sugar, into the loch--a ship's cargo or two will do the job--let us\r\nassemble all the jolly Udallers of the country, and in twenty-four hours\r\nyou shall see dry ground where the loch of Braebaster now is.\"\r\n\r\nA loud laugh of applause, which for a time actually silenced\r\nTriptolemus, attended a jest so very well suited to time and place--a\r\njolly toast was given--a merry song was sung--the ship unloaded her\r\nsweets--the pinnace made its genial rounds--the duet betwixt Magnus and\r\nTriptolemus, which had attracted the attention of the whole company from\r\nits superior vehemence, now once more sunk, and merged into the general\r\nhum of the convivial table, and the poet Halcro again resumed his\r\nusurped possession of the ear of Mordaunt Mertoun.\r\n\r\n\"Whereabouts was I?\" he said, with a tone which expressed to his weary\r\nlistener more plainly than words could, how much of his desultory tale\r\nyet remained to be told. \"O, I remember--we were just at the door of the\r\nWits' Coffeehouse--it was set up by one\"----\r\n\r\n\"Nay, but, my dear Master Halcro,\" said his hearer, somewhat\r\nimpatiently, \"I am desirous to hear of your meeting with Dryden.\"\r\n\r\n\"What, with glorious John?--true--ay--where was I? At the Wits'\r\nCoffeehouse--Well, in at the door we got--the waiters, and so forth,\r\nstaring at me; for as to Thimblethwaite, honest fellow, his was a\r\nwell-known face.--I can tell you a story about that\"----\r\n\r\n\"Nay, but John Dryden?\" said Mordaunt, in a tone which deprecated\r\nfurther digression.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, glorious John--where was I?--Well, as we stood close by the\r\nbar, where one fellow sat grinding of coffee, and another putting up\r\ntobacco into penny parcels--a pipe and a dish cost just a penny--then\r\nand there it was that I had the first peep of him. One Dennis sat near\r\nhim, who\"----\r\n\r\n\"Nay, but John Dryden--what like was he?\" demanded Mordaunt.\r\n\r\n\"Like a little fat old man, with his own grey hair, and in a\r\nfull-trimmed black suit, that sat close as a glove. Honest\r\nThimblethwaite let no one but himself shape for glorious John, and he\r\nhad a slashing hand at a sleeve, I promise you--But there is no getting\r\na mouthful of common sense spoken here--d----n that Scotchman, he and\r\nold Magnus are at it again!\"\r\n\r\nIt was very true; and although the interruption did not resemble a\r\nthunder-clap, to which the former stentorian exclamation of the Udaller\r\nmight have been likened, it was a close and clamorous dispute,\r\nmaintained by question, answer, retort, and repartee, as closely huddled\r\nupon each other as the sounds which announce from a distance a close and\r\nsustained fire of musketry.\r\n\r\n\"Hear reason, sir?\" said the Udaller; \"we will hear reason, and speak\r\nreason too; and if reason fall short, you shall have rhyme to boot.--Ha,\r\nmy little friend Halcro!\"\r\n\r\nThough cut off in the middle of his best story, (if that could be said\r\nto have a middle, which had neither beginning nor end,) the bard\r\nbristled up at the summons, like a corps of light infantry when ordered\r\nup to the support of the grenadiers, looked smart, slapped the table\r\nwith his hand, and denoted his becoming readiness to back his hospitable\r\nlandlord, as becomes a well-entertained guest. Triptolemus was a little\r\ndaunted at this reinforcement of his adversary; he paused, like a\r\ncautious general, in the sweeping attack which he had commenced on the\r\npeculiar usages of Zetland, and spoke not again until the Udaller poked\r\nhim with the insulting query, \"Where is your reason now, Master\r\nYellowley, that you were deafening me with a moment since?\"\r\n\r\n\"Be but patient, worthy sir,\" replied the agriculturist; \"what on earth\r\ncan you or any other man say in defence of that thing you call a plough,\r\nin this blinded country? Why, even the savage Highlandmen, in Caithness\r\nand Sutherland, can make more work, and better, with their gascromh, or\r\nwhatever they call it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what ails you at it, sir?\" said the Udaller; \"let me hear your\r\nobjections to it. It tills our land, and what would ye more?\"\r\n\r\n\"It hath but one handle or stilt,\" replied Triptolemus.\r\n\r\n\"And who the devil,\" said the poet, aiming at something smart, \"would\r\nwish to need a pair of stilts, if he can manage to walk with a single\r\none?\"\r\n\r\n\"Or tell me,\" said Magnus Troil, \"how it were possible for Neil of\r\nLupness, that lost one arm by his fall from the crag of Nekbreckan, to\r\nmanage a plough with two handles?\"\r\n\r\n\"The harness is of raw seal-skin,\" said Triptolemus.\r\n\r\n\"It will save dressed leather,\" answered Magnus Troil.\r\n\r\n\"It is drawn by four wretched bullocks,\" said the agriculturist, \"that\r\nare yoked breast-fashion; and two women must follow this unhappy\r\ninstrument, and complete the furrows with a couple of shovels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Drink about, Master Yellowley,\" said the Udaller; \"and, as you say in\r\nScotland, 'never fash your thumb.' Our cattle are too high-spirited to\r\nlet one go before the other; our men are too gentle and well-nurtured to\r\ntake the working-field without the women's company; our ploughs till our\r\nland--our land bears us barley; we brew our ale, eat our bread, and make\r\nstrangers welcome to their share of it. Here's to you, Master\r\nYellowley.\"\r\n\r\nThis was said in a tone meant to be decisive of the question; and,\r\naccordingly, Halcro whispered to Mordaunt, \"That has settled the matter,\r\nand now we will get on with glorious John.--There he sat in his suit of\r\nfull-trimmed black; two years due was the bill, as mine honest landlord\r\nafterwards told me,--and such an eye in his head!--none of your burning,\r\nblighting, falcon eyes, which we poets are apt to make a rout\r\nabout,--but a soft, full, thoughtful, yet penetrating glance--never saw\r\nthe like of it in my life, unless it were little Stephen Kleancogg's,\r\nthe fiddler, at Papastow, who\"----\r\n\r\n\"Nay, but John Dryden?\" said Mordaunt, who, for want of better\r\namusement, had begun to take a sort of pleasure in keeping the old\r\ngentleman to his narrative, as men herd in a restiff sheep, when they\r\nwish to catch him. He returned to his theme, with his usual phrase of\r\n\"Ay, true--glorious John--Well, sir, he cast his eye, such as I have\r\ndescribed it, on mine landlord, and 'Honest Tim,' said he, 'what hast\r\nthou got here?' and all the wits, and lords, and gentlemen, that used to\r\ncrowd round him, like the wenches round a pedlar at a fair, they made\r\nway for us, and up we came to the fireside, where he had his own\r\nestablished chair,--I have heard it was carried to the balcony in\r\nsummer, but it was by the fireside when I saw it,--so up came Tim\r\nThimblethwaite, through the midst of them, as bold as a lion, and I\r\nfollowed with a small parcel under my arm, which I had taken up partly\r\nto oblige my landlord, as the shop porter was not in the way, and partly\r\nthat I might be thought to have something to do there, for you are to\r\nthink there was no admittance at the Wits' for strangers who had no\r\nbusiness there.--I have heard that Sir Charles Sedley said a good thing\r\nabout that\"----\r\n\r\n\"Nay, but you forget glorious John,\" said Mordaunt.\r\n\r\n\"Ay, glorious you may well call him. They talk of their Blackmore, and\r\nShadwell, and such like,--not fit to tie the latchets of John's\r\nshoes--'Well,' he said to my landlord, 'what have you got there?' and\r\nhe, bowing, I warrant, lower than he would to a duke, said he had made\r\nbold to come and show him the stuff which Lady Elizabeth had chose for\r\nher nightgown.--'And which of your geese is that, Tim, who has got it\r\ntucked under his wing?'--'He is an Orkney goose, if it please you, Mr.\r\nDryden,' said Tim, who had wit at will, 'and he hath brought you a copy\r\nof verses for your honour to look at.'--'Is he amphibious?' said\r\nglorious John, taking the paper,--and methought I could rather have\r\nfaced a battery of cannon than the crackle it gave as it opened, though\r\nhe did not speak in a way to dash one neither;--and then he looked at\r\nthe verses, and he was pleased to say, in a very encouraging way indeed,\r\nwith a sort of good-humoured smile on his face, and certainly for a fat\r\nelderly gentleman,--for I would not compare it to Minna's smile, or\r\nBrenda's,--he had the pleasantest smile I ever saw,--'Why, Tim,' he\r\nsaid, 'this goose of yours will prove a swan on your hands.' With that\r\nhe smiled a little, and they all laughed, and none louder than those who\r\nstood too far off to hear the jest; for every one knew when he smiled\r\nthere was something worth laughing at, and so took it upon trust; and\r\nthe word passed through among the young Templars, and the wits, and the\r\nsmarts, and there was nothing but question on question who we were; and\r\none French fellow was trying to tell them it was only Monsieur Tim\r\nThimblethwaite; but he made such work with his Dumbletate and\r\nTimbletate, that I thought his explanation would have lasted\"----\r\n\r\n\"As long as your own story,\" thought Mordaunt; but the narrative was at\r\nlength finally cut short, by the strong and decided voice of the\r\nUdaller.\r\n\r\n\"I will hear no more on it, Mr. Factor!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"At least let me say something about the breed of horses,\" said\r\nYellowley, in rather a cry-mercy tone of voice. \"Your horses, my dear\r\nsir, resemble cats in size, and tigers in devilry!\"\r\n\r\n\"For their size,\" said Magnus, \"they are the easier for us to get off\r\nand on them--[as Triptolemus experienced this morning, thought Mordaunt\r\nto himself]--and, as for their devilry, let no one mount them that\r\ncannot manage them.\"\r\n\r\nA twinge of self-conviction, on the part of the agriculturist, prevented\r\nhim from reply. He darted a deprecatory glance at Mordaunt, as if for\r\nthe purpose of imploring secrecy respecting his tumble; and the Udaller,\r\nwho saw his advantage, although he was not aware of the cause, pursued\r\nit with the high and stern tone proper to one who had all his life been\r\nunaccustomed to meet with, and unapt to endure, opposition.\r\n\r\n\"By the blood of Saint Magnus the Martyr,\" he said, \"but you are a fine\r\nfellow, Master Factor Yellowley! You come to us from a strange land,\r\nunderstanding neither our laws, nor our manners, nor our language, and\r\nyou propose to become governor of the country, and that we should all be\r\nyour slaves!\"\r\n\r\n\"My pupils, worthy sir, my pupils!\" said Yellowley, \"and that only for\r\nyour own proper advantage.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are too old to go to school,\" said the Zetlander. \"I tell you once\r\nmore, we will sow and reap our grain as our fathers did--we will eat\r\nwhat God sends us, with our doors open to the stranger, even as theirs\r\nwere open. If there is aught imperfect in our practice, we will amend it\r\nin time and season; but the blessed Baptist's holyday was made for light\r\nhearts and quick heels. He that speaks a word more of reason, as you\r\ncall it, or any thing that looks like it, shall swallow a pint of\r\nsea-water--he shall, by this hand!--and so fill up the good ship, the\r\nJolly Mariner of Canton, once more, for the benefit of those that will\r\nstick by her; and let the rest have a fling with the fiddlers, who have\r\nbeen summoning us this hour. I will warrant every wench is on tiptoe by\r\nthis time. Come, Mr. Yellowley, no unkindness, man--why, man, thou\r\nfeelest the rolling of the Jolly Mariner still\"--(for, in truth, honest\r\nTriptolemus showed a little unsteadiness of motion, as he rose to attend\r\nhis host)--\"but never mind, we shall have thee find thy land-legs to\r\nreel it with yonder bonny belles. Come along, Triptolemus--let me\r\ngrapple thee fast, lest thou _trip_, old Triptolemus--ha, ha, ha!\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the portly though weatherbeaten hulk of the Udaller sailed\r\noff like a man-of-war that had braved a hundred gales, having his guest\r\nin tow like a recent prize. The greater part of the revellers followed\r\ntheir leader with loud jubilee, although there were several stanch\r\ntopers, who, taking the option left them by the Udaller, remained behind\r\nto relieve the Jolly Mariner of a fresh cargo, amidst many a pledge to\r\nthe health of their absent landlord, and to the prosperity of his\r\nroof-tree, with whatsoever other wishes of kindness could be devised, as\r\nan apology for another pint-bumper of noble punch.\r\n\r\nThe rest soon thronged the dancing-room, an apartment which partook of\r\nthe simplicity of the time and of the country. Drawing-rooms and saloons\r\nwere then unknown in Scotland, save in the houses of the nobility, and\r\nof course absolutely so in Zetland; but a long, low, anomalous\r\nstore-room, sometimes used for the depositation of merchandise,\r\nsometimes for putting aside lumber, and a thousand other purposes, was\r\nwell known to all the youth of Dunrossness, and of many a district\r\nbesides, as the scene of the merry dance, which was sustained with so\r\nmuch glee when Magnus Troil gave his frequent feasts.\r\n\r\nThe first appearance of this ball-room might have shocked a fashionable\r\nparty, assembled for the quadrille or the waltz. Low as we have stated\r\nthe apartment to be, it was but imperfectly illuminated by lamps,\r\ncandles, ship-lanterns, and a variety of other _candelabra_, which\r\nserved to throw a dusky light upon the floor, and upon the heaps of\r\nmerchandise and miscellaneous articles which were piled around; some of\r\nthem stores for the winter; some, goods destined for exportation; some,\r\nthe tribute of Neptune, paid at the expense of shipwrecked vessels,\r\nwhose owners were unknown; some, articles of barter received by the\r\nproprietor, who, like most others at the period, was somewhat of a\r\nmerchant as well as a landholder, in exchange for the fish, and other\r\narticles, the produce of his estate. All these, with the chests, boxes,\r\ncasks, &c., which contained them, had been drawn aside, and piled one\r\nabove the other, in order to give room for the dancers, who, light and\r\nlively as if they had occupied the most splendid saloon in the parish of\r\nSt. James's, executed their national dances with equal grace and\r\nactivity.\r\n\r\nThe group of old men who looked on, bore no inconsiderable resemblance\r\nto a party of aged tritons, engaged in beholding the sports of the\r\nsea-nymphs; so hard a look had most of them acquired by contending with\r\nthe elements, and so much did the shaggy hair and beards, which many of\r\nthem cultivated after the ancient Norwegian fashion, give their heads\r\nthe character of these supposed natives of the deep. The young people,\r\non the other hand, were uncommonly handsome, tall, well-made, and\r\nshapely; the men with long fair hair, and, until broken by the weather,\r\na fresh ruddy complexion, which, in the females, was softened into a\r\nbloom of infinite delicacy. Their natural good ear for music qualified\r\nthem to second to the utmost the exertions of a band, whose strains were\r\nby no means contemptible; while the elders, who stood around or sat\r\nquiet upon the old sea-chests, which served for chairs, criticised the\r\ndancers, as they compared their execution with their own exertions in\r\nformer days; or, warmed by the cup and flagon, which continued to\r\ncirculate among them, snapped their fingers, and beat time with their\r\nfeet to the music.\r\n\r\nMordaunt looked upon this scene of universal mirth with the painful\r\nrecollection, that he, thrust aside from his pre-eminence, no longer\r\nexercised the important duties of chief of the dancers, or office of\r\nleader of the revels, which had been assigned to the stranger Cleveland.\r\nAnxious, however, to suppress the feelings of his own disappointment,\r\nwhich he felt it was neither wise to entertain nor manly to display, he\r\napproached his fair neighbours, to whom he had been so acceptable at\r\ntable, with the purpose of inviting one of them to become his partner in\r\nthe dance. But the awfully ancient old lady, even the Lady Glowrowrum,\r\nwho had only tolerated the exuberance of her nieces' mirth during the\r\ntime of dinner, because her situation rendered it then impossible for\r\nher to interfere, was not disposed to permit the apprehended renewal of\r\nthe intimacy implied in Mertoun's invitation. She therefore took upon\r\nherself, in the name of her two nieces, who sat pouting beside her in\r\ndispleased silence, to inform Mordaunt, after thanking him for his\r\ncivility, that the hands of her nieces were engaged for that evening;\r\nand, as he continued to watch the party at a little distance, he had an\r\nopportunity of being convinced that the alleged engagement was a mere\r\napology to get rid of him, when he saw the two good-humoured sisters\r\njoin the dance, under the auspices of the next young men who asked their\r\nhands. Incensed at so marked a slight, and unwilling to expose himself\r\nto another, Mordaunt Mertoun drew back from the circle of dancers,\r\nshrouded himself amongst the mass of inferior persons who crowded into\r\nthe bottom of the room as spectators, and there, concealed from the\r\nobservation of others, digested his own mortification as well as he\r\ncould--that is to say, very ill--and with all the philosophy of his\r\nage--that is to say, with none at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n  A torch for me--let wantons, light of heart,\r\n  Tickle the useless rushes with their heels:\r\n  For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase--\r\n  I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.\r\n\r\n                                         _Romeo and Juliet._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe youth, says the moralist Johnson, cares not for the boy's\r\nhobbyhorse, nor the man for the youth's mistress; and therefore the\r\ndistress of Mordaunt Mertoun, when excluded from the merry dance, may\r\nseem trifling to many of my readers, who would, nevertheless, think they\r\ndid well to be angry if deposed from their usual place in an assembly of\r\na different kind. There lacked not amusement, however, for those whom\r\nthe dance did not suit, or who were not happy enough to find partners to\r\ntheir liking. Halcro, now completely in his element, had assembled round\r\nhim an audience, to whom he was declaiming his poetry with all the\r\nenthusiasm of glorious John himself, and receiving in return the usual\r\ndegree of applause allowed to minstrels who recite their own rhymes--so\r\nlong at least as the author is within hearing of the criticism. Halcro's\r\npoetry might indeed have interested the antiquary as well as the admirer\r\nof the Muses, for several of his pieces were translations or imitations\r\nfrom the Scaldic sagas, which continued to be sung by the fishermen of\r\nthose islands even until a very late period; insomuch, that when Gray's\r\npoems first found their way to Orkney, the old people recognised at\r\nonce, in the ode of the \"Fatal Sisters,\" the Runic rhymes which had\r\namused or terrified their infancy under the title of the \"Magicians,\"\r\nand which the fishers of North Ronaldshaw, and other remote isles, used\r\nstill to sing when asked for a Norse ditty.[41]\r\n\r\nHalf listening, half lost in his own reflections, Mordaunt Mertoun stood\r\nnear the door of the apartment, and in the outer ring of the little\r\ncircle formed around old Halcro, while the bard chanted to a low, wild,\r\nmonotonous air, varied only by the efforts of the singer to give\r\ninterest and emphasis to particular passages, the following imitation of\r\na Northern war-song:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SONG OF HAROLD HARFAGER.\r\n\r\n  The sun is rising dimly red,\r\n  The wind is wailing low and dread;\r\n  From his cliff the eagle sallies,\r\n  Leaves the wolf his darksome valleys;\r\n  In the midst the ravens hover,\r\n  Peep the wild-dogs from the cover,\r\n  Screaming, croaking, baying, yelling,\r\n  Each in his wild accents telling,\r\n  \"Soon we feast on dead and dying,\r\n  Fair-hair'd Harold's flag is flying.\"\r\n\r\n  Many a crest in air is streaming,\r\n  Many a helmet darkly gleaming,\r\n  Many an arm the axe uprears,\r\n  Doom'd to hew the wood of spears.\r\n  All along the crowded ranks,\r\n  Horses neigh and armour clanks;\r\n  Chiefs are shouting, clarions ringing,\r\n  Louder still the bard is singing,\r\n  \"Gather, footmen,--gather, horsemen,\r\n  To the field, ye valiant Norsemen!\r\n\r\n  \"Halt ye not for food or slumber,\r\n  View not vantage, count not number;\r\n  Jolly reapers, forward still;\r\n  Grow the crop on vale or hill,\r\n  Thick or scatter'd, stiff or lithe,\r\n  It shall down before the scythe.\r\n  Forward with your sickles bright,\r\n  Reap the harvest of the fight--\r\n  Onward, footmen,--onward, horsemen,\r\n  To the charge, ye gallant Norsemen!\r\n\r\n  \"Fatal Choosers of the Slaughter,\r\n  O'er you hovers Odin's daughter;\r\n  Hear the voice she spreads before ye,--\r\n  Victory, and wealth, and glory;\r\n  Or old Valhalla's roaring hail,\r\n  Her ever-circling mead and ale,\r\n  Where for eternity unite\r\n  The joys of wassail and of fight.\r\n  Headlong forward, foot and horsemen,\r\n  Charge and fight, and die like Norsemen!\"\r\n\r\n\"The poor unhappy blinded heathens!\" said Triptolemus, with a sigh deep\r\nenough for a groan; \"they speak of their eternal cups of ale, and I\r\nquestion if they kend how to manage a croft land of grain!\"\r\n\r\n\"The cleverer fellows they, neighbour Yellowley,\" answered the poet, \"if\r\nthey made ale without barley.\"\r\n\r\n\"Barley!--alack-a-day!\" replied the more accurate agriculturist, \"who\r\never heard of barley in these parts? Bear, my dearest friend, bear is\r\nall they have, and wonderment it is to me that they ever see an awn of\r\nit. Ye scart the land with a bit thing ye ca' a pleugh--ye might as weel\r\ngive it a ritt with the teeth of a redding-kame. O, to see the sock, and\r\nthe heel, and the sole-clout of a real steady Scottish pleugh, with a\r\nchield like a Samson between the stilts, laying a weight on them would\r\nkeep down a mountain; twa stately owsen, and as many broad-breasted\r\nhorse in the traces, going through soil and till, and leaving a fur in\r\nthe ground would carry off water like a causeyed syver! They that have\r\nseen a sight like that, have seen something to crack about in another\r\nsort, than those unhappy auld-warld stories of war and slaughter, of\r\nwhich the land has seen even but too mickle, for a' your singing and\r\nsoughing awa in praise of such bloodthirsty doings, Master Claud\r\nHalcro.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a heresy,\" said the animated little poet, bridling and drawing\r\nhimself up, as if the whole defence of the Orcadian Archipelago rested\r\non his single arm--\"It is a heresy so much as to name one's native\r\ncountry, if a man is not prepared when and how to defend himself--ay,\r\nand to annoy another. The time has been, that if we made not good ale\r\nand aquavitæ, we knew well enough where to find that which was ready\r\nmade to our hand; but now the descendants of Sea-kings, and Champions,\r\nand Berserkars, are become as incapable of using their swords, as if\r\nthey were so many women. Ye may praise them for a strong pull on an oar,\r\nor a sure foot on a skerry; but what else could glorious John himself\r\nsay of ye, my good Hialtlanders, that any man would listen to?\"\r\n\r\n\"Spoken like an angel, most noble poet,\" said Cleveland, who, during an\r\ninterval of the dance, stood near the party in which this conversation\r\nwas held. \"The old champions you talked to us about yesternight, were\r\nthe men to make a harp ring--gallant fellows, that were friends to the\r\nsea, and enemies to all that sailed on it. Their ships, I suppose, were\r\nclumsy enough; but if it is true that they went upon the account as far\r\nas the Levant, I scarce believe that ever better fellows unloosed a\r\ntopsail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" replied Halcro, \"there you spoke them right. In those days none\r\ncould call their life and means of living their own, unless they dwelt\r\ntwenty miles out of sight of the blue sea. Why, they had public prayers\r\nput up in every church in Europe, for deliverance from the ire of the\r\nNorthmen. In France and England, ay, and in Scotland too, for as high as\r\nthey hold their head now-a-days, there was not a bay or a haven, but it\r\nwas freer to our forefathers than to the poor devils of natives; and now\r\nwe cannot, forsooth, so much as grow our own barley without Scottish\r\nhelp\"--(here he darted a sarcastic glance at the factor)--\"I would I saw\r\nthe time we were to measure arms with them again!\"\r\n\r\n\"Spoken like a hero once more,\" said Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" continued the little bard, \"I would it were possible to see our\r\nbarks, once the water-dragons of the world, swimming with the black\r\nraven standard waving at the topmast, and their decks glimmering with\r\narms, instead of being heaped up with stockfish--winning with our\r\nfearless hands what the niggard soil denies--paying back all old scorn\r\nand modern injury--reaping where we never sowed, and felling what we\r\nnever planted--living and laughing through the world, and smiling when\r\nwe were summoned to quit it!\"\r\n\r\nSo spoke Claud Halcro, in no serious, or at least most certainly in no\r\nsober mood, his brain (never the most stable) whizzing under the\r\ninfluence of fifty well-remembered sagas, besides five bumpers of\r\nusquebaugh and brandy; and Cleveland, between jest and earnest, clapped\r\nhim on the shoulder, and again repeated, \"Spoken like a hero!\"\r\n\r\n\"Spoken like a fool, I think,\" said Magnus Troil, whose attention had\r\nbeen also attracted by the vehemence of the little bard--\"where would\r\nyou cruize upon, or against whom?--we are all subjects of one realm, I\r\ntrow, and I would have you to remember, that your voyage may bring up at\r\nExecution-dock.--I like not the Scots--no offence, Mr. Yellowley--that\r\nis, I would like them well enough if they would stay quiet in their own\r\nland, and leave us at peace with our own people, and manners, and\r\nfashions; and if they would but abide there till I went to harry them\r\nlike a mad old Berserkar, I would leave them in peace till the day of\r\njudgment. With what the sea sends us, and the land lends us, as the\r\nproverb says, and a set of honest neighbourly folks to help us to\r\nconsume it, so help me, Saint Magnus, as I think we are even but too\r\nhappy!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know what war is,\" said an old man, \"and I would as soon sail through\r\nSumburgh-roost in a cockle-shell, or in a worse loom, as I would venture\r\nthere again.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, pray, what wars knew your valour?\" said Halcro, who, though\r\nforbearing to contradict his landlord from a sense of respect, was not a\r\nwhit inclined to abandon his argument to any meaner authority.\r\n\r\n\"I was pressed,\" answered the old Triton, \"to serve under Montrose, when\r\nhe came here about the sixteen hundred and fifty-one, and carried a sort\r\nof us off, will ye nill ye, to get our throats cut in the wilds of\r\nStrathnavern[42](_k_)--I shall never forget it--we had been hard put to\r\nit for victuals--what would I have given for a luncheon of Burgh-Westra\r\nbeef--ay, or a mess of sour sillocks?--When our Highlandmen brought in a\r\ndainty drove of kyloes, much ceremony there was not, for we shot and\r\nfelled, and flayed, and roasted, and broiled, as it came to every man's\r\nhand; till, just as our beards were at the greasiest, we heard--God\r\npreserve us--a tramp of horse, then twa or three drapping shots,--then\r\ncame a full salvo,--and then, when the officers were crying on us to\r\nstand, and maist of us looking which way we might run away, down they\r\nbroke, horse and foot, with old John Urry, or Hurry,[43] or whatever\r\nthey called him--he hurried us that day, and worried us to boot--and we\r\nbegan to fall as thick as the stots that we were felling five minutes\r\nbefore.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Montrose,\" said the soft voice of the graceful Minna; \"what became\r\nof Montrose, or how looked he?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like a lion with the hunters before him,\" answered the old gentleman;\r\n\"but I looked not twice his way, for my own lay right over the hill.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so you left him?\" said Minna, in a tone of the deepest contempt.\r\n\r\n\"It was no fault of mine, Mistress Minna,\" answered the old man,\r\nsomewhat out of countenance; \"but I was there with no choice of my own;\r\nand, besides, what good could I have done?--all the rest were running\r\nlike sheep, and why should I have staid?\"\r\n\r\n\"You might have died with him,\" said Minna.\r\n\r\n\"And lived with him to all eternity, in immortal verse!\" added Claud\r\nHalcro.\r\n\r\n\"I thank you, Mistress Minna,\" replied the plain-dealing Zetlander; \"and\r\nI thank you, my old friend Claud;--but I would rather drink both your\r\nhealths in this good bicker of ale, like a living man as I am, than that\r\nyou should be making songs in my honour, for having died forty or fifty\r\nyears agone. But what signified it,--run or fight, 'twas all one;--they\r\ntook Montrose, poor fellow, for all his doughty deeds, and they took me\r\nthat did no doughty deeds at all; and they hanged him, poor man, and as\r\nfor me\"----\r\n\r\n\"I trust in Heaven they flogged and pickled you,\" said Cleveland, worn\r\nout of patience with the dull narrative of the peaceful Zetlander's\r\npoltroonery, of which he seemed so wondrous little ashamed.\r\n\r\n\"Flog horses, and pickle beef,\" said Magnus; \"Why, you have not the\r\nvanity to think, that, with all your quarterdeck airs, you will make\r\npoor old neighbour Haagen ashamed that he was not killed some scores of\r\nyears since? You have looked on death yourself, my doughty young friend,\r\nbut it was with the eyes of a young man who wishes to be thought of; but\r\nwe are a peaceful people,--peaceful, that is, as long as any one should\r\nbe peaceful, and that is till some one has the impudence to wrong us, or\r\nour neighbours; and then, perhaps, they may not find our northern blood\r\nmuch cooler in our veins than was that of the old Scandinavians that\r\ngave us our names and lineage.--Get ye along, get ye along to the\r\nsword-dance,[44] that the strangers that are amongst us may see that our\r\nhands and our weapons are not altogether unacquainted even yet.\"\r\n\r\nA dozen cutlasses, selected hastily from an old arm-chest, and whose\r\nrusted hue bespoke how seldom they left the sheath, armed the same\r\nnumber of young Zetlanders, with whom mingled six maidens, led by Minna\r\nTroil; and the minstrelsy instantly commenced a tune appropriate to the\r\nancient Norwegian war-dance, the evolutions of which are perhaps still\r\npractised in those remote islands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe first movement was graceful and majestic, the youths holding their\r\nswords erect, and without much gesture; but the tune, and the\r\ncorresponding motions of the dancers, became gradually more and more\r\nrapid,--they clashed their swords together, in measured time, with a\r\nspirit which gave the exercise a dangerous appearance in the eye of the\r\nspectator, though the firmness, justice, and accuracy, with which the\r\ndancers kept time with the stroke of their weapons, did, in truth,\r\nensure its safety. The most singular part of the exhibition was the\r\ncourage exhibited by the female performers, who now, surrounded by the\r\nswordsmen, seemed like the Sabine maidens in the hands of their Roman\r\nlovers; now, moving under the arch of steel which the young men had\r\nformed, by crossing their weapons over the heads of their fair partners,\r\nresembled the band of Amazons when they first joined in the Pyrrhic\r\ndance with the followers of Theseus. But by far the most striking and\r\nappropriate figure was that of Minna Troil, whom Halcro had long\r\nsince entitled the Queen of Swords, and who, indeed, moved amidst the\r\nswordsmen with an air, which seemed to hold all the drawn blades as the\r\nproper accompaniments of her person, and the implements of her pleasure.\r\nAnd when the mazes of the dance became more intricate, when the close\r\nand continuous clash of the weapons made some of her companions shrink,\r\nand show signs of fear, her cheek, her lip, and her eye, seemed rather\r\nto announce, that, at the moment when the weapons flashed fastest, and\r\nrung sharpest around her, she was most completely self-possessed, and in\r\nher own element. Last of all, when the music had ceased, and she\r\nremained for an instant upon the floor by herself, as the rule of the\r\ndance required, the swordsmen and maidens, who departed from around her,\r\nseemed the guards and the train of some princess, who, dismissed by her\r\nsignal, were leaving her for a time to solitude. Her own look and\r\nattitude, wrapped, as she probably was, in some vision of the\r\nimagination, corresponded admirably with the ideal dignity which the\r\nspectators ascribed to her; but, almost immediately recollecting\r\nherself, she blushed, as if conscious she had been, though but for an\r\ninstant, the object of undivided attention, and gave her hand gracefully\r\nto Cleveland, who, though he had not joined in the dance, assumed the\r\nduty of conducting her to her seat.\r\n\r\nAs they passed, Mordaunt Mertoun might observe that Cleveland whispered\r\ninto Minna's ear, and that her brief reply was accompanied with even\r\nmore discomposure of countenance than she had manifested when\r\nencountering the gaze of the whole assembly. Mordaunt's suspicions were\r\nstrongly awakened by what he observed, for he knew Minna's character\r\nwell, and with what equanimity and indifference she was in the custom of\r\nreceiving the usual compliments and gallantries with which her beauty\r\nand her situation rendered her sufficiently familiar.\r\n\r\n\"Can it be possible she really loves this stranger?\" was the unpleasant\r\nthought that instantly shot across Mordaunt's mind;--\"And if she does,\r\nwhat is my interest in the matter?\" was the second; and which was\r\nquickly followed by the reflection, that though he claimed no interest\r\nat any time but as a friend, and though that interest was now withdrawn,\r\nhe was still, in consideration of their former intimacy, entitled both\r\nto be sorry and angry at her for throwing away her affections on one he\r\njudged unworthy of her. In this process of reasoning, it is probable\r\nthat a little mortified vanity, or some indescribable shade of selfish\r\nregret, might be endeavouring to assume the disguise of disinterested\r\ngenerosity; but there is so much of base alloy in our very best\r\n(unassisted) thoughts, that it is melancholy work to criticise too\r\nclosely the motives of our most worthy actions; at least we would\r\nrecommend to every one to let those of his neighbours pass current,\r\nhowever narrowly he may examine the purity of his own.\r\n\r\nThe sword-dance was succeeded by various other specimens of the same\r\nexercise, and by songs, to which the singers lent their whole soul,\r\nwhile the audience were sure, as occasion offered, to unite in some\r\nfavourite chorus. It is upon such occasions that music, though of a\r\nsimple and even rude character, finds its natural empire over the\r\ngenerous bosom, and produces that strong excitement which cannot be\r\nattained by the most learned compositions of the first masters, which\r\nare caviare to the common ear, although, doubtless, they afford a\r\ndelight, exquisite in its kind, to those whose natural capacity and\r\neducation have enabled them to comprehend and relish those difficult and\r\ncomplicated combinations of harmony.\r\n\r\nIt was about midnight when a knocking at the door of the mansion, with\r\nthe sound of the _Gue_ and the _Langspiel_, announced, by their tinkling\r\nchime, the arrival of fresh revellers, to whom, according to the\r\nhospitable custom of the country, the apartments were instantly thrown\r\nopen.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[41] See Note I.--Norse Fragments.\r\n\r\n[42] Montrose, in his last and ill-advised attempt to invade Scotland,\r\naugmented his small army of Danes and Scottish Royalists, by some bands\r\nof raw troops, hastily levied, or rather pressed into his service, in\r\nthe Orkney and Zetland Isles, who, having little heart either to the\r\ncause or manner of service, behaved but indifferently when they came\r\ninto action.\r\n\r\n[43] Here, as afterwards remarked in the text, the Zetlander's memory\r\ndeceived him grossly. Sir John Urry, a brave soldier of fortune, was at\r\nthat time in Montrose's army, and made prisoner along with him. He had\r\nchanged so often that the mistake is pardonable. After the action, he\r\nwas executed by the Covenanters; and\r\n\r\n  \"Wind-changing Warwick then could change no more\"\r\n\r\nStrachan commanded the body by which Montrose was routed.\r\n\r\n[44] Note VII.--The Sword-Dance.(_l_)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n  --------My mind misgives,\r\n  Some consequence, yet hanging in the stars,\r\n  Shall bitterly begin his fearful date\r\n  With this night's revels.\r\n\r\n                                         _Romeo and Juliet._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new-comers were, according to the frequent custom of such frolickers\r\nall over the world, disguised in a sort of masquing habits, and designed\r\nto represent the Tritons and Mermaids, with whom ancient tradition and\r\npopular belief have peopled the northern seas. The former, called by\r\nZetlanders of that time, Shoupeltins, were represented by young men\r\ngrotesquely habited, with false hair, and beards made of flax, and\r\nchaplets composed of sea-ware interwoven with shells, and other marine\r\nproductions, with which also were decorated their light-blue or greenish\r\nmantles of wadmaal, repeatedly before-mentioned. They had fish-spears,\r\nand other emblems of their assumed quality, amongst which the classical\r\ntaste of Claud Halcro, by whom the masque was arranged, had not\r\nforgotten the conch-shells, which were stoutly and hoarsely winded, from\r\ntime to time, by one or two of the aquatic deities, to the great\r\nannoyance of all who stood near them.\r\n\r\nThe Nereids and Water-nymphs who attended on this occasion, displayed,\r\nas usual, a little more taste and ornament than was to be seen amongst\r\ntheir male attendants. Fantastic garments of green silk, and other\r\nmaterials of superior cost and fashion, had been contrived, so as to\r\nimitate their idea of the inhabitants of the waters, and, at the same\r\ntime, to show the shape and features of the fair wearers to the best\r\nadvantage. The bracelets and shells, which adorned the neck, arms, and\r\nankles of the pretty Mermaidens, were, in some cases, intermixed with\r\nreal pearls; and the appearance, upon the whole, was such as might have\r\ndone no discredit to the court of Amphitrite, especially when the long\r\nbright locks, blue eyes, fair complexions, and pleasing features of the\r\nmaidens of Thule, were taken into consideration. We do not indeed\r\npretend to aver, that any of these seeming Mermaids had so accurately\r\nimitated the real siren, as commentators have supposed those attendant\r\non Cleopatra did, who, adopting the fish's train of their original, were\r\nable, nevertheless, to make their \"bends,\" or \"ends,\" (said commentators\r\ncannot tell which,) \"adornings.\"[45] Indeed, had they not left their\r\nextremities in their natural state, it would have been impossible for\r\nthe Zetland sirens to have executed the very pretty dance, with which\r\nthey rewarded the company for the ready admission which had been granted\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nIt was soon discovered that these masquers were no strangers, but a part\r\nof the guests, who, stealing out a little time before, had thus\r\ndisguised themselves, in order to give variety to the mirth of the\r\nevening. The muse of Claud Halcro, always active on such occasions, had\r\nsupplied them with an appropriate song, of which we may give the\r\nfollowing specimen. The song was alternate betwixt a Nereid or Mermaid,\r\nand a Merman or Triton--the males and females on either part forming a\r\nsemi-chorus, which accompanied and bore burden to the principal singer.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nMERMAID.\r\n\r\n  Fathoms deep beneath the wave,\r\n    Stringing beads of glistering pearl,\r\n  Singing the achievements brave\r\n    Of many an old Norwegian earl;\r\n  Dwelling where the tempest's raving\r\n    Falls as light upon our ear,\r\n  As the sigh of lover, craving\r\n    Pity from his lady dear,\r\n  Children of wild Thule, we,\r\n  From the deep caves of the sea,\r\n  As the lark springs from the lea,\r\n  Hither come, to share your glee.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nMERMAN.\r\n\r\n  From reining of the water-horse,\r\n    That bounded till the waves were foaming,\r\n  Watching the infant tempest's course,\r\n    Chasing the sea-snake in his roaming;\r\n  From winding charge-notes on the shell,\r\n    When the huge whale and sword-fish duel,\r\n  Or tolling shroudless seamen's knell,\r\n    When the winds and waves are cruel;\r\n  Children of wild Thule, we\r\n  Have plough'd such furrows on the sea\r\n  As the steer draws on the lea,\r\n  And hither we come to share your glee.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nMERMAIDS AND MERMEN.\r\n\r\n  We heard you in our twilight caves,\r\n    A hundred fathom deep below,\r\n  For notes of joy can pierce the waves,\r\n    That drown each sound of war and woe.\r\n  Those who dwell beneath the sea\r\n    Love the sons of Thule well;\r\n  Thus, to aid your mirth, bring we\r\n    Dance, and song, and sounding shell.\r\n  Children of dark Thule, know,\r\n  Those who dwell by haaf and voe,\r\n  Where your daring shallops row,\r\n  Come to share the festal show.\r\n\r\nThe final chorus was borne by the whole voices, excepting those carrying\r\nthe conch-shells, who had been trained to blow them in a sort of rude\r\naccompaniment, which had a good effect. The poetry, as well as the\r\nperformance of the masquers, received great applause from all who\r\npretended to be judges of such matters; but above all, from Triptolemus\r\nYellowley, who, his ear having caught the agricultural sounds of plough\r\nand furrow, and his brain being so well drenched that it could only\r\nconstrue the words in their most literal acceptation, declared roundly,\r\nand called Mordaunt to bear witness, that, though it was a shame to\r\nwaste so much good lint as went to form the Tritons' beards and\r\nperiwigs, the song contained the only words of common sense which he had\r\nheard all that long day.\r\n\r\nBut Mordaunt had no time to answer the appeal, being engaged in\r\nattending with the utmost vigilance to the motions of one of the female\r\nmasquers, who had given him a private signal as they entered, which\r\ninduced him, though uncertain who she might prove to be, to expect some\r\ncommunication from her of importance. The siren who had so boldly\r\ntouched his arm, and had accompanied the gesture with an expression of\r\neye which bespoke his attention, was disguised with a good deal more\r\ncare than her sister-masquers, her mantle being loose, and wide enough\r\nto conceal her shape completely, and her face hidden beneath a silk\r\nmask. He observed that she gradually detached herself from the rest of\r\nthe masquers, and at length placed herself, as if for the advantage of\r\nthe air, near the door of a chamber which remained open, looked\r\nearnestly at him again, and then taking an opportunity, when the\r\nattention of the company was fixed upon the rest of her party, she left\r\nthe apartment.\r\n\r\nMordaunt did not hesitate instantly to follow his mysterious guide, for\r\nsuch we may term the masquer, as she paused to let him see the direction\r\nshe was about to take, and then walked swiftly towards the shore of the\r\nvoe, or salt-water lake, now lying full before them, its small\r\nsummer-waves glistening and rippling under the influence of a broad\r\nmoonlight, which, added to the strong twilight of those regions during\r\nthe summer solstice, left no reason to regret the absence of the sun,\r\nthe path of whose setting was still visible on the waves of the west,\r\nwhile the horizon on the east side was already beginning to glimmer with\r\nthe lights of dawn.\r\n\r\nMordaunt had therefore no difficulty in keeping sight of his disguised\r\nguide, as she tripped it over height and hollow to the sea-side, and,\r\nwinding among the rocks, led the way to the spot where his own labours,\r\nduring the time of his former intimacy at Burgh-Westra, had constructed\r\na sheltered and solitary seat, where the daughters of Magnus were\r\naccustomed to spend, when the weather was suitable, a good deal of their\r\ntime. Here, then, was to be the place of explanation; for the masquer\r\nstopped, and, after a moment's hesitation, sat down on the rustic\r\nsettle. But, from the lips of whom was he to receive it? Norna had first\r\noccurred to him; but her tall figure and slow majestic step were\r\nentirely different from the size and gait of the more fairy-formed\r\nsiren, who had preceded him with as light a trip as if she had been a\r\nreal Nereid, who, having remained too late upon the shore, was, under\r\nthe dread of Amphitrite's displeasure, hastening to regain her native\r\nelement. Since it was not Norna, it could be only, he thought, Brenda,\r\nwho thus singled him out; and when she had seated herself upon the\r\nbench, and taken the mask from her face, Brenda it accordingly proved to\r\nbe. Mordaunt had certainly done nothing to make him dread her presence;\r\nand yet, such is the influence of bashfulness over the ingenuous youth\r\nof both sexes, that he experienced all the embarrassment of one who\r\nfinds himself unexpectedly placed before a person who is justly offended\r\nwith him. Brenda felt no less embarrassment; but as she had sought this\r\ninterview, and was sensible it must be a brief one, she was compelled,\r\nin spite of herself, to begin the conversation.\r\n\r\n\"Mordaunt,\" she said, with a hesitating voice; then correcting herself,\r\nshe proceeded--\"You must be surprised, Mr. Mertoun, that I should have\r\ntaken this uncommon freedom.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was not till this morning, Brenda,\" replied Mordaunt, \"that any mark\r\nof friendship or intimacy from you or from your sister could have\r\nsurprised me. I am far more astonished that you should shun me without\r\nreason for so many hours, than that you should now allow me an\r\ninterview. In the name of Heaven, Brenda, in what have I offended you?\r\nor why are we on these unusual terms?\"\r\n\r\n\"May it not be enough to say,\" replied Brenda, looking downward, \"that\r\nit is my father's pleasure?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, it is not enough,\" returned Mertoun. \"Your father cannot have so\r\nsuddenly altered his whole thoughts of me, and his whole actions towards\r\nme, without acting under the influence of some strong delusion. I ask\r\nyou but to explain of what nature it is; for I will be contented to be\r\nlower in your esteem than the meanest hind in these islands, if I cannot\r\nshow that his change of opinion is only grounded upon some infamous\r\ndeception, or some extraordinary mistake.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be so,\" said Brenda--\"I hope it is so--that I do hope it is so,\r\nmy desire to see you thus in private may well prove to you. But it is\r\ndifficult--in short, it is impossible for me to explain to you the cause\r\nof my father's resentment. Norna has spoken with him concerning it\r\nboldly, and I fear they parted in displeasure; and you well know no\r\nlight matter could cause that.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have observed,\" said Mordaunt, \"that your father is most attentive to\r\nNorna's counsel, and more complaisant to her peculiarities than to those\r\nof others--this I have observed, though he is no willing believer in the\r\nsupernatural qualities to which she lays claim.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are related distantly,\" answered Brenda, \"and were friends in\r\nyouth--nay, as I have heard, it was once supposed they would have been\r\nmarried; but Norna's peculiarities showed themselves immediately on her\r\nfather's death, and there was an end of that matter, if ever there was\r\nany thing in it. But it is certain my father regards her with much\r\ninterest; and it is, I fear, a sign how deeply his prejudices respecting\r\nyou must be rooted, since they have in some degree quarrelled on your\r\naccount.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, blessings upon you, Brenda, that you have called them prejudices,\"\r\nsaid Mertoun, warmly and hastily--\"a thousand blessings on you! You were\r\never gentle-hearted--you could not have maintained even the show of\r\nunkindness long.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was indeed but a show,\" said Brenda, softening gradually into the\r\nfamiliar tone in which they had conversed from infancy; \"I could never\r\nthink, Mordaunt,--never, that is, seriously believe, that you could say\r\naught unkind of Minna or of me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who dares to say I have?\" said Mordaunt, giving way to the natural\r\nimpetuosity of his disposition--\"Who dares to say that I have, and\r\nventures at the same time to hope that I will suffer his tongue to\r\nremain in safety betwixt his jaws? By Saint Magnus the Martyr, I will\r\nfeed the hawks with it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, now,\" said Brenda, \"your anger only terrifies me, and will force\r\nme to leave you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Leave me,\" said he, \"without telling me either the calumny, or the name\r\nof the villainous calumniator!\"\r\n\r\n\"O, there are more than one,\" answered Brenda, \"that have possessed my\r\nfather with an opinion--which I cannot myself tell you--but there are\r\nmore than one who say\"----\r\n\r\n\"Were they hundreds, Brenda, I will do no less to them than I have\r\nsaid--Sacred Martyr!--to accuse me of speaking unkindly of those whom I\r\nmost respected and valued under Heaven--I will back to the apartment\r\nthis instant, and your father shall do me right before all the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not go, for the love of Heaven!\" said Brenda; \"do not go, as you\r\nwould not render me the most unhappy wretch in existence!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me then, at least, if I guess aright,\" said Mordaunt, \"when I name\r\nthis Cleveland for one of those who have slandered me?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said Brenda, vehemently, \"you run from one error into another\r\nmore dangerous. You say you are my friend:--I am willing to be\r\nyours:--be but still for a moment, and hear what I have to say;--our\r\ninterview has lasted but too long already, and every additional moment\r\nbrings additional danger with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, then,\" said Mertoun, much softened by the poor girl's extreme\r\napprehension and distress, \"what it is that you require of me; and\r\nbelieve me, it is impossible for you to ask aught that I will not do my\r\nvery uttermost to comply with.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then--this Captain,\" said Brenda, \"this Cleveland\"----\r\n\r\n\"I knew it, by Heaven!\" said Mordaunt; \"my mind assured me that that\r\nfellow was, in one way or other, at the bottom of all this mischief and\r\nmisunderstanding!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you cannot be silent, and patient, for an instant,\" replied Brenda,\r\n\"I must instantly quit you: what I meant to say had no relation to you,\r\nbut to another,--in one word, to my sister Minna. I have nothing to say\r\nconcerning her dislike to you, but an anxious tale to tell concerning\r\nhis attention to her.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is obvious, striking, and marked,\" said Mordaunt; \"and, unless my\r\neyes deceive me, it is received as welcome, if, indeed, it is not\r\nreturned.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the very cause of my fear,\" said Brenda. \"I, too, was struck\r\nwith the external appearance, frank manners, and romantic conversation\r\nof this man.\"\r\n\r\n\"His appearance!\" said Mordaunt; \"he is stout and well-featured enough,\r\nto be sure; but, as old Sinclair of Quendale said to the Spanish\r\nadmiral, 'Farcie on his face! I have seen many a fairer hang on the\r\nBorough-moor.'--From his manners, he might be captain of a privateer;\r\nand by his conversation, the trumpeter to his own puppetshow; for he\r\nspeaks of little else than his own exploits.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken,\" answered Brenda; \"he speaks but too well on all that\r\nhe has seen and learned; besides, he has really been in many distant\r\ncountries, and in many gallant actions, and he can tell them with as\r\nmuch spirit as modesty. You would think you saw the flash and heard the\r\nreport of the guns. And he has other tones of talking too--about the\r\ndelightful trees and fruits of distant climates; and how the people wear\r\nno dress, through the whole year, half so warm as our summer gowns, and,\r\nindeed, put on little except cambric and muslin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word, Brenda, he does seem to understand the business of\r\namusing young ladies,\" replied Mordaunt.\r\n\r\n\"He does, indeed,\" said Brenda, with great simplicity. \"I assure you\r\nthat, at first, I liked him better than Minna did; and yet, though she\r\nis so much cleverer than I am, I know more of the world than she does;\r\nfor I have seen more of cities, having been once at Kirkwall; besides\r\nthat I was thrice at Lerwick, when the Dutch ships were there, and so I\r\nshould not be very easily deceived in people.\"\r\n\r\n\"And pray, Brenda,\" said Mertoun, \"what was it that made you think less\r\nfavourably of this young fellow, who seems to be so captivating?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" said Brenda, after a moment's reflection, \"at first he was much\r\nlivelier; and the stories he told were not quite so melancholy, or so\r\nterrible; and he laughed and danced more.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, perhaps, at that time, danced oftener with Brenda than with her\r\nsister?\" added Mordaunt.\r\n\r\n\"No--I am not sure of that,\" said Brenda; \"and yet, to speak plain, I\r\ncould have no suspicion of him at all while he was attending quite\r\nequally to us both; for you know that then he could have been no more to\r\nus than yourself, Mordaunt Mertoun, or young Swaraster, or any other\r\nyoung man in the islands.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, why then,\" said Mordaunt, \"should you not see him, with patience,\r\nbecome acquainted with your sister?--He is wealthy, or seems to be so at\r\nleast. You say he is accomplished and pleasant;--what else would you\r\ndesire in a lover for Minna?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mordaunt, you forget who we are,\" said the maiden, assuming an air of\r\nconsequence, which sat as gracefully upon her simplicity, as did the\r\ndifferent tone in which she had spoken hitherto. \"This is a little world\r\nof ours, this Zetland, inferior, perhaps, in soil and climate to other\r\nparts of the earth, at least so strangers say; but it is our own little\r\nworld, and we, the daughters of Magnus Troil, hold a first rank in it.\r\nIt would I think, little become us, who are descended from Sea-kings\r\nand Jarls, to throw ourselves away upon a stranger, who comes to our\r\ncoast, like the eider-duck in spring, from we know not whence, and may\r\nleave it in autumn, to go we know not where.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who may yet entice a Zetland golden-eye to accompany his\r\nmigration,\" said Mertoun.\r\n\r\n\"I will hear nothing light on such a subject,\" replied Brenda,\r\nindignantly; \"Minna, like myself, is the daughter of Magnus Troil, the\r\nfriend of strangers, but the Father of Hialtland. He gives them the\r\nhospitality they need; but let not the proudest of them think that they\r\ncan, at their pleasure, ally with his house.\"\r\n\r\nShe said this in a tone of considerable warmth, which she instantly\r\nsoftened, as she added, \"No, Mordaunt, do not suppose that Minna Troil\r\nis capable of so far forgetting what she owes to her father and her\r\nfather's blood, as to think of marrying this Cleveland; but she may lend\r\nan ear to him so long as to destroy her future happiness. She has that\r\nsort of mind, into which some feelings sink deeply;--you remember how\r\nUlla Storlson used to go, day by day, to the top of Vossdale-head, to\r\nlook for her lover's ship that was never to return? When I think of her\r\nslow step, her pale cheek, her eye, that grew dimmer and dimmer, like\r\nthe lamp that is half extinguished for lack of oil,--when I remember the\r\nfluttered look, of something like hope, with which she ascended the\r\ncliff at morning, and the deep dead despair which sat on her forehead\r\nwhen she returned,--when I think on all this, can you wonder that I fear\r\nfor Minna, whose heart is formed to entertain, with such deep-rooted\r\nfidelity, any affection that may be implanted in it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not wonder,\" said Mordaunt, eagerly sympathizing with the poor\r\ngirl; for, besides the tremulous expression of her voice, the light\r\ncould almost show him the tear which trembled in her eye, as she drew\r\nthe picture to which her fancy had assimilated her sister,--\"I do not\r\nwonder that you should feel and fear whatever the purest affection can\r\ndictate; and if you can but point out to me in what I can serve your\r\nsisterly love, you shall find me as ready to venture my life, if\r\nnecessary, as I have been to go out on the crag to get you the eggs of\r\nthe guillemot; and, believe me, that whatever has been told to your\r\nfather or yourself, of my entertaining the slightest thoughts of\r\ndisrespect or unkindness, is as false as a fiend could devise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe it,\" said Brenda, giving him her hand; \"I believe it, and my\r\nbosom is lighter, now I have renewed my confidence in so old a friend.\r\nHow you can aid us, I know not; but it was by the advice, I may say by\r\nthe commands, of Norna, that I have ventured to make this communication;\r\nand I almost wonder,\" she added, as she looked around her, \"that I have\r\nhad courage to carry me through it. At present you know all that I can\r\ntell you of the risk in which my sister stands. Look after this\r\nCleveland--beware how you quarrel with him, since you must so surely\r\ncome by the worst with an experienced soldier.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not exactly understand,\" said the youth, \"how that should so\r\nsurely be. This I know, that with the good limbs and good heart that God\r\nhath given me, ay, and with a good cause to boot--I am little afraid of\r\nany quarrel which Cleveland can fix upon me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, if not for your own sake, for Minna's sake,\" said Brenda--\"for\r\nmy father's--for mine--for all our sakes, avoid any strife with him, but\r\nbe contented to watch him, and, if possible, to discover who he is, and\r\nwhat are his intentions towards us. He has talked of going to Orkney, to\r\nenquire after the consort with whom he sailed; but day after day, and\r\nweek after week passes, and he goes not; and while he keeps my father\r\ncompany over the bottle, and tells Minna romantic stories of foreign\r\npeople, and distant wars, in wild and unknown regions, the time glides\r\non, and the stranger, of whom we know nothing except that he is one,\r\nbecomes gradually closer and more inseparably intimate in our\r\nsociety.--And now, farewell. Norna hopes to make your peace with my\r\nfather, and entreats you not to leave Burgh-Westra to-morrow, however\r\ncold he and my sister may appear towards you. I too,\" she said,\r\nstretching her hand towards him, \"must wear a face of cold friendship as\r\ntowards an unwelcome visitor, but at heart we are still Brenda and\r\nMordaunt. And now separate quickly, for we must not be seen together.\"\r\n\r\nShe stretched her hand to him, but withdrew it in some slight confusion,\r\nlaughing and blushing, when, by a natural impulse, he was about to press\r\nit to his lips. He endeavoured for a moment to detain her, for the\r\ninterview had for him a degree of fascination, which, as often as he had\r\nbefore been alone with Brenda, he had never experienced. But she\r\nextricated herself from him, and again signing an adieu, and pointing\r\nout to him a path different from that which she was herself about to\r\ntake, tripped towards the house, and was soon hidden from his view by\r\nthe acclivity.\r\n\r\nMordaunt stood gazing after her in a state of mind, to which, as yet,\r\nhe had been a stranger. The dubious neutral ground between love and\r\nfriendship may be long and safely trodden, until he who stands upon it\r\nis suddenly called upon to recognise the authority of the one or the\r\nother power; and then it most frequently happens, that the party who for\r\nyears supposed himself only a friend, finds himself at once transformed\r\ninto a lover. That such a change in Mordaunt's feelings should take\r\nplace from this date, although he himself was unable exactly to\r\ndistinguish its nature, was to be expected. He found himself at once\r\nreceived, with the most unsuspicious frankness, into the confidence of a\r\nbeautiful and fascinating young woman, by whom he had, so short a time\r\nbefore, imagined himself despised and disliked; and, if any thing could\r\nmake a change, in itself so surprising and so pleasing, yet more\r\nintoxicating, it was the guileless and open-hearted simplicity of\r\nBrenda, that cast an enchantment over every thing which she did or said.\r\nThe scene, too, might have had its effect, though there was little\r\noccasion for its aid. But a fair face looks yet fairer under the light\r\nof the moon, and a sweet voice sounds yet sweeter among the whispering\r\nsounds of a summer night. Mordaunt, therefore, who had by this time\r\nreturned to the house, was disposed to listen with unusual patience and\r\ncomplacency to the enthusiastic declamation pronounced upon moonlight by\r\nClaud Halcro, whose ecstasies had been awakened on the subject by a\r\nshort turn in the open air, undertaken to qualify the vapours of the\r\ngood liquor, which he had not spared during the festival.\r\n\r\n\"The sun, my boy,\" he said, \"is every wretched labourer's\r\nday-lantern--it comes glaring yonder out of the east, to summon up a\r\nwhole world to labour and to misery; whereas the merry moon lights all\r\nof us to mirth and to love.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to madness, or she is much belied,\" said Mordaunt, by way of saying\r\nsomething.\r\n\r\n\"Let it be so,\" answered Halcro, \"so she does not turn us\r\nmelancholy-mad.--My dear young friend, the folks of this painstaking\r\nworld are far too anxious about possessing all their wits, or having\r\nthem, as they say, about them. At least I know I have been often called\r\nhalf-witted, and I am sure I have gone through the world as well as if I\r\nhad double the quantity. But stop--where was I? O, touching and\r\nconcerning the moon--why, man, she is the very soul of love and poetry.\r\nI question if there was ever a true lover in existence who had not got\r\nat least as far as 'O thou,' in a sonnet in her praise.\"\r\n\r\n\"The moon,\" said the factor, who was now beginning to speak very thick,\r\n\"ripens corn, at least the old folk said so--and she fills nuts also,\r\nwhilk is of less matter--_sparge nuces, pueri_.\"\r\n\r\n\"A fine, a fine,\" said the Udaller, who was now in his altitudes; \"the\r\nfactor speaks Greek--by the bones of my holy namesake, Saint Magnus, he\r\nshall drink off the yawl full of punch, unless he gives us a song on the\r\nspot!\"\r\n\r\n\"Too much water drowned the miller,\" answered Triptolemus. \"My brain has\r\nmore need of draining than of being drenched with more liquor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sing, then,\" said the despotic landlord, \"for no one shall speak any\r\nother language here, save honest Norse, jolly Dutch, or Danske, or broad\r\nScots, at the least of it. So, Eric Scambester, produce the yawl, and\r\nfill it to the brim, as a charge for demurrage.\"\r\n\r\nEre the vessel could reach the agriculturist, he, seeing it under way,\r\nand steering towards him by short tacks, (for Scambester himself was by\r\nthis time not over steady in his course,) made a desperate effort, and\r\nbegan to sing, or rather to croak forth, a Yorkshire harvest-home\r\nballad, which his father used to sing when he was a little mellow, and\r\nwhich went to the tune of \"Hey Dobbin, away with the waggon.\" The rueful\r\naspect of the singer, and the desperately discordant tones of his voice,\r\nformed so delightful a contrast with the jollity of the words and tune,\r\nthat honest Triptolemus afforded the same sort of amusement which a\r\nreveller might give, by appearing on a festival-day in the holyday-coat\r\nof his grandfather. The jest concluded the evening, for even the mighty\r\nand strong-headed Magnus himself had confessed the influence of the\r\nsleepy god. The guests went off as they best might, each to his separate\r\ncrib and resting place, and in a short time the mansion, which was of\r\nlate so noisy, was hushed into perfect silence.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[45] See some admirable discussion on this passage, in the Variorum\r\nShakspeare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n  They man their boats, and all the young men arm,\r\n  With whatsoever might the monsters harm;\r\n  Pikes, halberds, spits, and darts, that wound afar,\r\n  The tools of peace, and implements of war.\r\n  Now was the time for vigorous lads to show\r\n  What love or honour could incite them to;--\r\n  A goodly theatre, where rocks are round\r\n  With reverend age and lovely lasses crown'd.\r\n\r\n                             _Battle of the Summer Islands._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning which succeeds such a feast as that of Magnus Troil, usually\r\nlacks a little of the zest which seasoned the revels of the preceding\r\nday, as the fashionable reader may have observed at a public breakfast\r\nduring the race-week in a country town; for, in what is called the best\r\nsociety, these lingering moments are usually spent by the company, each\r\napart in their own dressing-rooms. At Burgh-Westra, it will readily be\r\nbelieved, no such space for retirement was afforded; and the lasses,\r\nwith their paler cheeks, the elder dames, with many a wink and yawn,\r\nwere compelled to meet with their male companions (headaches and all)\r\njust three hours after they had parted from each other.\r\n\r\nEric Scambester had done all that man could do to supply the full means\r\nof diverting the ennui of the morning meal. The board groaned with\r\nrounds of hung beef, made after the fashion of Zetland--with\r\npasties--with baked meats--with fish, dressed and cured in every\r\npossible manner; nay, with the foreign delicacies of tea, coffee, and\r\nchocolate; for, as we have already had occasion to remark, the situation\r\nof these islands made them early acquainted with various articles of\r\nforeign luxury, which were, as yet, but little known in Scotland, where,\r\nat a much later period than that we write of, one pound of green tea was\r\ndressed like cabbage, and another converted into a vegetable sauce for\r\nsalt beef, by the ignorance of the good housewives to whom they had been\r\nsent as rare presents.\r\n\r\nBesides these preparations, the table exhibited whatever mighty potions\r\nare resorted to by _bons vivans_, under the facetious name of a \"hair of\r\nthe dog that bit you.\" There was the potent Irish Usquebaugh--right\r\nNantz--genuine Schiedamm--Aquavitæ from Caithness--and Golden Wasser\r\nfrom Hamburgh; there was rum of formidable antiquity, and cordials from\r\nthe Leeward Islands. After these details, it were needless to mention\r\nthe stout home-brewed ale--the German mum, and Schwartz beer--and still\r\nmore would it be beneath our dignity to dwell upon the innumerable sorts\r\nof pottage and flummery, together with the bland, and various\r\npreparations of milk, for those who preferred thinner potations.\r\n\r\nNo wonder that the sight of so much good cheer awakened the appetite and\r\nraised the spirits of the fatigued revellers. The young men began\r\nimmediately to seek out their partners of the preceding evening, and to\r\nrenew the small talk which had driven the night so merrily away; while\r\nMagnus, with his stout old Norse kindred, encouraged, by precept and\r\nexample, those of elder days and graver mood, to a substantial\r\nflirtation with the good things before them. Still, however, there was\r\na long period to be filled up before dinner; for the most protracted\r\nbreakfast cannot well last above an hour; and it was to be feared that\r\nClaud Halcro meditated the occupation of this vacant morning with a\r\nformidable recitation of his own verses, besides telling, at its full\r\nlength, the whole history of his introduction to glorious John Dryden.\r\nBut fortune relieved the guests of Burgh-Westra from this threatened\r\ninfliction, by sending them means of amusement peculiarly suited to\r\ntheir taste and habits.\r\n\r\nMost of the guests were using their toothpicks, some were beginning to\r\ntalk of what was to be done next, when, with haste in his step, fire in\r\nhis eye, and a harpoon in his hand, Eric Scambester came to announce to\r\nthe company, that there was a whale on shore, or nearly so, at the\r\nthroat of the voe! Then you might have seen such a joyous, boisterous,\r\nand universal bustle, as only the love of sport, so deeply implanted in\r\nour nature, can possibly inspire. A set of country squires, about to\r\nbeat for the first woodcocks of the season, were a comparison as petty,\r\nin respect to the glee, as in regard to the importance of the object;\r\nthe battue, upon a strong cover in Ettrick Forest, for the destruction\r\nof the foxes;(_m_) the insurrection of the sportsmen of the Lennox, when\r\none of the Duke's deer gets out from Inch-Mirran; nay, the joyous rally\r\nof the fox-chase itself, with all its blithe accompaniments of hound and\r\nhorn, fall infinitely short of the animation with which the gallant sons\r\nof Thule set off to encounter the monster, whom the sea had sent for\r\ntheir amusement at so opportune a conjuncture.\r\n\r\nThe multifarious stores of Burgh-Westra were rummaged hastily for all\r\nsorts of arms, which could be used on such an occasion. Harpoons,\r\nswords, pikes, and halberds, fell to the lot of some; others contented\r\nthemselves with hay-forks, spits, and whatever else could be found, that\r\nwas at once long and sharp. Thus hastily equipped, one division, under\r\nthe command of Captain Cleveland, hastened to man the boats which lay in\r\nthe little haven, while the rest of the party hurried by land to the\r\nscene of action.\r\n\r\nPoor Triptolemus was interrupted in a plan, which he, too, had formed\r\nagainst the patience of the Zetlanders, and which was to have consisted\r\nin a lecture upon the agriculture, and the capabilities of the country,\r\nby this sudden hubbub, which put an end at once to Halcro's poetry, and\r\nto his no less formidable prose. It may be easily imagined, that he took\r\nvery little interest in the sport which was so suddenly substituted for\r\nhis lucubrations, and he would not even have deigned to have looked upon\r\nthe active scene which was about to take place, had he not been\r\nstimulated thereunto by the exhortations of Mistress Baby. \"Pit yoursell\r\nforward, man,\" said that provident person, \"pit yoursell forward--wha\r\nkens whare a blessing may light?--they say that a' men share and share\r\nequals-aquals in the creature's ulzie, and a pint o't wad be worth\r\nsiller, to light the cruise in the lang dark nights that they speak of.\r\nPit yoursell forward, man--there's a graip to ye--faint heart never wan\r\nfair lady--wha kens but what, when it's fresh, it may eat weel eneugh,\r\nand spare butter?\"\r\n\r\nWhat zeal was added to Triptolemus's motions, by the prospect of eating\r\nfresh train-oil, instead of butter, we know not; but, as better might\r\nnot be, he brandished the rural implement (a stable-fork) with which he\r\nwas armed, and went down to wage battle with the whale.\r\n\r\nThe situation in which the enemy's ill fate had placed him, was\r\nparticularly favourable to the enterprise of the islanders. A tide of\r\nunusual height had carried the animal over a large bar of sand, into the\r\nvoe or creek in which he was now lying. So soon as he found the water\r\nebbing, he became sensible of his danger, and had made desperate efforts\r\nto get over the shallow water, where the waves broke on the bar; but\r\nhitherto he had rather injured than mended his condition, having got\r\nhimself partly aground, and lying therefore particularly exposed to the\r\nmeditated attack. At this moment the enemy came down upon him. The front\r\nranks consisted of the young and hardy, armed in the miscellaneous\r\nmanner we have described; while, to witness and animate their efforts,\r\nthe young women, and the elderly persons of both sexes, took their place\r\namong the rocks, which overhung the scene of action.\r\n\r\nAs the boats had to double a little headland, ere they opened the mouth\r\nof the voe, those who came by land to the shores of the inlet, had time\r\nto make the necessary reconnoissances upon the force and situation of\r\nthe enemy, on whom they were about to commence a simultaneous attack by\r\nland and sea.\r\n\r\nThis duty, the stout-hearted and experienced general, for so the Udaller\r\nmight be termed, would intrust to no eyes but his own; and, indeed, his\r\nexternal appearance, and his sage conduct, rendered him alike qualified\r\nfor the command which he enjoyed. His gold-laced hat was exchanged for a\r\nbearskin cap, his suit of blue broadcloth, with its scarlet lining, and\r\nloops, and frogs of bullion, had given place to a red flannel jacket,\r\nwith buttons of black horn, over which he wore a seal-skin shirt\r\ncuriously seamed and plaited on the bosom, such as are used by the\r\nEsquimaux, and sometimes by the Greenland whale-fishers. Sea-boots of a\r\nformidable size completed his dress, and in his hand he held a large\r\nwhaling-knife, which he brandished, as if impatient to employ it in the\r\noperation of _flinching_ the huge animal which lay before them,--that\r\nis, the act of separating its flesh from its bones. Upon closer\r\nexamination, however, he was obliged to confess, that the sport to which\r\nhe had conducted his friends, however much it corresponded with the\r\nmagnificent scale of his hospitality, was likely to be attended with its\r\nown peculiar dangers and difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe animal, upwards of sixty feet in length, was lying perfectly still,\r\nin a deep part of the voe into which it had weltered, and where it\r\nseemed to await the return of tide, of which it was probably assured by\r\ninstinct. A council of experienced harpooners was instantly called, and\r\nit was agreed that an effort should be made to noose the tail of this\r\ntorpid leviathan, by casting a cable around it, to be made fast by\r\nanchors to the shore, and thus to secure against his escape, in case the\r\ntide should make before they were able to dispatch him. Three boats were\r\ndestined to this delicate piece of service, one of which the Udaller\r\nhimself proposed to command, while Cleveland and Mertoun were to direct\r\nthe two others. This being decided, they sat down on the strand, waiting\r\nwith impatience until the naval part of the force should arrive in the\r\nvoe. It was during this interval, that Triptolemus Yellowley, after\r\nmeasuring with his eyes the extraordinary size of the whale, observed,\r\nthat in his poor mind, \"A wain with six owsen, or with sixty owsen\r\neither, if they were the owsen of the country, could not drag siccan a\r\nhuge creature from the water, where it was now lying, to the sea-beach.\"\r\n\r\nTrifling as this remark may seem to the reader, it was connected with a\r\nsubject which always fired the blood of the old Udaller, who, glancing\r\nupon Triptolemus a quick and stern look, asked him what the devil it\r\nsignified, supposing a hundred oxen could not drag the whale upon the\r\nbeach? Mr. Yellowley, though not much liking the tone with which the\r\nquestion was put, felt that his dignity and his profit compelled him to\r\nanswer as follows:--\"Nay, sir--you know yoursell, Master Magnus Troil,\r\nand every one knows that knows any thing, that whales of siccan size as\r\nmay not be masterfully dragged on shore by the instrumentality of one\r\nwain with six owsen, are the right and property of the Admiral, who is\r\nat this time the same noble lord who is, moreover, Chamberlain of these\r\nisles.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I tell you, Mr. Triptolemus Yellowley,\" said the Udaller, \"as I\r\nwould tell your master if he were here, that every man who risks his\r\nlife to bring that fish ashore, shall have an equal share and partition,\r\naccording to our ancient and loveable Norse custom and wont; nay, if\r\nthere is so much as a woman looking on, that will but touch the cable,\r\nshe will be partner with us; ay, and more than all that, if she will but\r\nsay there is a reason for it, we will assign a portion to the babe that\r\nis unborn.\"(_n_)\r\n\r\nThe strict principle of equity, which dictated this last arrangement,\r\noccasioned laughter among the men, and some slight confusion among the\r\nwomen. The factor, however, thought it shame to be so easily daunted.\r\n\"_Suum cuique tribuito_,\" said he; \"I will stand for my lord's right and\r\nmy own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you?\" replied Magnus; \"then, by the Martyr's bones, you shall have\r\nno law of partition but that of God and Saint Olave, which we had before\r\neither factor, or treasurer, or chamberlain were heard of!--All shall\r\nshare that lend a hand, and never a one else. So you, Master Factor,\r\nshall be busy as well as other folk, and think yourself lucky to share\r\nlike other folk. Jump into that boat,\" (for the boats had by this time\r\npulled round the headland,) \"and you, my lads, make way for the factor\r\nin the stern-sheets--he shall be the first man this blessed day that\r\nshall strike the fish.\"\r\n\r\nThe loud authoritative voice, and the habit of absolute command inferred\r\nin the Udaller's whole manner, together with the conscious want of\r\nfavourers and backers amongst the rest of the company, rendered it\r\ndifficult for Triptolemus to evade compliance, although he was thus\r\nabout to be placed in a situation equally novel and perilous. He was\r\nstill, however, hesitating, and attempting an explanation, with a voice\r\nin which anger was qualified by fear, and both thinly disguised under an\r\nattempt to be jocular, and to represent the whole as a jest, when he\r\nheard the voice of Baby maundering in his ear,--\"Wad he lose his share\r\nof the ulzie, and the lang Zetland winter coming on, when the lightest\r\nday in December is not so clear as a moonless night in the Mearns?\"\r\n\r\nThis domestic instigation, in addition to those of fear of the Udaller,\r\nand shame to seem less courageous than others, so inflamed the\r\nagriculturist's spirits, that he shook his _graip_ aloft, and entered\r\nthe boat with the air of Neptune himself, carrying on high his trident.\r\n\r\nThe three boats destined for this perilous service, now approached the\r\ndark mass, which lay like an islet in the deepest part of the voe, and\r\nsuffered them to approach without showing any sign of animation.\r\nSilently, and with such precaution as the extreme delicacy of the\r\noperation required, the intrepid adventurers, after the failure of their\r\nfirst attempt, and the expenditure of considerable time, succeeded in\r\ncasting a cable around the body of the torpid monster, and in carrying\r\nthe ends of it ashore, when an hundred hands were instantly employed in\r\nsecuring them. But ere this was accomplished, the tide began to make\r\nfast, and the Udaller informed his assistants, that either the fish must\r\nbe killed, or at least greatly wounded, ere the depth of water on the\r\nbar was sufficient to float him; or that he was not unlikely to escape\r\nfrom their joint prowess.\r\n\r\n\"Wherefore,\" said he, \"we must set to work, and the factor shall have\r\nthe honour to make the first throw.\"\r\n\r\nThe valiant Triptolemus caught the word; and it is necessary to say that\r\nthe patience of the whale, in suffering himself to be noosed without\r\nresistance, had abated his terrors, and very much lowered the creature\r\nin his opinion. He protested the fish had no more wit, and scarcely more\r\nactivity, than a black snail; and, influenced by this undue contempt of\r\nthe adversary, he waited neither for a further signal, nor a better\r\nweapon, nor a more suitable position, but, rising in his energy, hurled\r\nhis graip with all his force against the unfortunate monster. The boats\r\nhad not yet retreated from him to the distance necessary to ensure\r\nsafety, when this injudicious commencement of the war took place.\r\n\r\nMagnus Troil, who had only jested with the factor, and had reserved the\r\nlaunching the first spear against the whale to some much more skilful\r\nhand, had just time to exclaim, \"Mind yourselves, lads, or we are all\r\nswamped!\" when the monster, roused at once from inactivity by the blow\r\nof the factor's missile, blew, with a noise resembling the explosion of\r\na steam-engine, a huge shower of water into the air, and at the same\r\ntime began to lash the waves with his tail in every direction. The boat\r\nin which Magnus presided received the shower of brine which the animal\r\nspouted aloft; and the adventurous Triptolemus, who had a full share of\r\nthe immersion, was so much astonished and terrified by the consequences\r\nof his own valorous deed, that he tumbled backwards amongst the feet of\r\nthe people, who, too busy to attend to him, were actively engaged in\r\ngetting the boat into shoal water, out of the whale's reach. Here he lay\r\nfor some minutes, trampled on by the feet of the boatmen, until they lay\r\non their oars to bale, when the Udaller ordered them to pull to shore,\r\nand land this spare hand, who had commenced the fishing so\r\ninauspiciously.\r\n\r\nWhile this was doing, the other boats had also pulled off to safer\r\ndistance, and now, from these as well as from the shore, the unfortunate\r\nnative of the deep was overwhelmed by all kinds of missiles,--harpoons\r\nand spears flew against him on all sides--guns were fired, and each\r\nvarious means of annoyance plied which could excite him to exhaust his\r\nstrength in useless rage. When the animal found that he was locked in by\r\nshallows on all sides, and became sensible, at the same time, of the\r\nstrain of the cable on his body, the convulsive efforts which he made to\r\nescape, accompanied with sounds resembling deep and loud groans, would\r\nhave moved the compassion of all but a practised whale-fisher. The\r\nrepeated showers which he spouted into the air began now to be mingled\r\nwith blood, and the waves which surrounded him assumed the same crimson\r\nappearance. Meantime the attempts of the assailants were redoubled; but\r\nMordaunt Mertoun and Cleveland, in particular, exerted themselves to the\r\nuttermost, contending who should display most courage in approaching the\r\nmonster, so tremendous in its agonies, and should inflict the most deep\r\nand deadly wounds upon its huge bulk.\r\n\r\nThe contest seemed at last pretty well over; for although the animal\r\ncontinued from time to time to make frantic exertions for liberty, yet\r\nits strength appeared so much exhausted, that, even with the assistance\r\nof the tide, which had now risen considerably, it was thought it could\r\nscarcely extricate itself.\r\n\r\nMagnus gave the signal to venture nearer to the whale, calling out at\r\nthe same time, \"Close in, lads, he is not half so mad now--The Factor\r\nmay look for a winter's oil for the two lamps at Harfra--Pull close in,\r\nlads.\"\r\n\r\nEre his orders could be obeyed, the other two boats had anticipated his\r\npurpose; and Mordaunt Mertoun, eager to distinguish himself above\r\nCleveland, had, with the whole strength he possessed, plunged a\r\nhalf-pike into the body of the animal. But the leviathan, like a nation\r\nwhose resources appear totally exhausted by previous losses and\r\ncalamities, collected his whole remaining force for an effort, which\r\nproved at once desperate and successful. The wound, last received, had\r\nprobably reached through his external defences of blubber, and attained\r\nsome very sensitive part of the system; for he roared aloud, as he sent\r\nto the sky a mingled sheet of brine and blood, and snapping the strong\r\ncable like a twig, overset Mertoun's boat with a blow of his tail, shot\r\nhimself, by a mighty effort, over the bar, upon which the tide had now\r\nrisen considerably, and made out to sea, carrying with him a whole grove\r\nof the implements which had been planted in his body, and leaving behind\r\nhim, on the waters, a dark red trace of his course.\r\n\r\n\"There goes to sea your cruise of oil, Master Yellowley,\" said Magnus,\r\n\"and you must consume mutton suet, or go to bed in the dark.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Operam et oleum perdidi_,\" muttered Triptolemus; \"but if they catch me\r\nwhale-fishing again, I will consent that the fish shall swallow me as he\r\ndid Jonah.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where is Mordaunt Mertoun all this while?\" exclaimed Claud Halcro;\r\nand it was instantly perceived that the youth, who had been stunned when\r\nhis boat was stove, was unable to swim to shore as the other sailors\r\ndid, and now floated senseless upon the waves.\r\n\r\nWe have noticed the strange and inhuman prejudice, which rendered the\r\nZetlanders of that period unwilling to assist those whom they saw in the\r\nact of drowning, though that is the calamity to which the islanders are\r\nmost frequently exposed. Three men, however, soared above this\r\nsuperstition. The first was Claud Halcro, who threw himself from a small\r\nrock headlong into the waves, forgetting, as he himself afterwards\r\nstated, that he could not swim, and, if possessed of the harp of Arion,\r\nhad no dolphins in attendance. The first plunge which the poet made in\r\ndeep water, reminding him of these deficiencies, he was fain to cling to\r\nthe rock from which he had dived, and was at length glad to regain the\r\nshore, at the expense of a ducking.\r\n\r\nMagnus Troil, whose honest heart forgot his late coolness towards\r\nMordaunt, when he saw the youth's danger, would instantly have brought\r\nhim more effectual aid, but Eric Scambester held him fast.\r\n\r\n\"Hout, sir--hout,\" exclaimed that faithful attendant--\"Captain Cleveland\r\nhas a grip of Mr. Mordaunt--just let the twa strangers help ilk other,\r\nand stand by the upshot. The light of the country is not to be quenched\r\nfor the like of them. Bide still, sir, I say--Bredness Voe is not a bowl\r\nof punch, that a man can be fished out of like a toast with a long\r\nspoon.\"\r\n\r\nThis sage remonstrance would have been altogether lost upon Magnus, had\r\nhe not observed that Cleveland had in fact jumped out of the boat, and\r\nswum to Mertoun's assistance, and was keeping him afloat till the boat\r\ncame to the aid of both. As soon as the immediate danger which called so\r\nloudly for assistance was thus ended, the honest Udaller's desire to\r\nrender aid terminated also; and recollecting the cause of offence which\r\nhe had, or thought he had, against Mordaunt Mertoun, he shook off his\r\nbutler's hold, and turning round scornfully from the beach, called Eric\r\nan old fool for supposing that he cared whether the young fellow sank or\r\nswam.\r\n\r\nStill, however, amid his assumed indifference, Magnus could not help\r\npeeping over the heads of the circle, which, surrounding Mordaunt as\r\nsoon as he was brought on shore, were charitably employed in\r\nendeavouring to recall him to life; and he was not able to attain the\r\nappearance of absolute unconcern, until the young man sat up on the\r\nbeach, and showed plainly that the accident had been attended with no\r\nmaterial consequences. It was then first that, cursing the assistants\r\nfor not giving the lad a glass of brandy, he walked sullenly away, as\r\nif totally unconcerned in his fate.\r\n\r\nThe women, always accurate in observing the telltale emotions of each\r\nother, failed not to remark, that when the sisters of Burgh-Westra saw\r\nMordaunt immersed in the waves, Minna grew as pale as death, while\r\nBrenda uttered successive shrieks of terror. But though there were some\r\nnods, winks, and hints that auld acquaintance were not easily forgot, it\r\nwas, on the whole, candidly admitted, that less than such marks of\r\ninterest could scarce have been expected, when they saw the companion of\r\ntheir early youth in the act of perishing before their eyes.\r\n\r\nWhatever interest Mordaunt's condition excited while it seemed perilous,\r\nbegan to abate as he recovered himself; and when his senses were fully\r\nrestored, only Claud Halcro, with two or three others, were standing by\r\nhim. About ten paces off stood Cleveland--his hair and clothes dropping\r\nwater, and his features wearing so peculiar an expression, as\r\nimmediately to arrest the attention of Mordaunt. There was a suppressed\r\nsmile on his cheek, and a look of pride in his eye, that implied\r\nliberation from a painful restraint, and something resembling gratified\r\nscorn. Claud Halcro hastened to intimate to Mordaunt, that he owed his\r\nlife to Cleveland; and the youth, rising from the ground, and losing all\r\nother feelings in those of gratitude, stepped forward with his hand\r\nstretched out, to offer his warmest thanks to his preserver. But he\r\nstopped short in surprise, as Cleveland, retreating a pace or two,\r\nfolded his arms on his breast, and declined to accept his proffered\r\nhand. He drew back in turn, and gazed with astonishment at the\r\nungracious manner, and almost insulting look, with which Cleveland, who\r\nhad formerly rather expressed a frank cordiality, or at least openness\r\nof bearing, now, after having thus rendered him a most important\r\nservice, chose to receive his thanks.\r\n\r\n\"It is enough,\" said Cleveland, observing his surprise, \"and it is\r\nunnecessary to say more about it. I have paid back my debt, and we are\r\nnow equal.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are more than equal with me, Captain Cleveland,\" answered Mertoun,\r\n\"because you endangered your life to do for me what I did for you\r\nwithout the slightest risk;--besides,\" he added, trying to give the\r\ndiscourse a more pleasant turn, \"I have your rifle-gun to boot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cowards only count danger for any point of the game,\" said Cleveland.\r\n\"Danger has been my consort for life, and sailed with me on a thousand\r\nworse voyages;--and for rifles, I have enough of my own, and you may\r\nsee, when you will, which can use them best.\"\r\n\r\nThere was something in the tone with which this was said, that struck\r\nMordaunt strongly; it was miching malicho, as Hamlet says, and meant\r\nmischief. Cleveland saw his surprise, came close up to him, and spoke in\r\na low tone of voice:--\"Hark ye, my young brother. There is a custom\r\namong us gentlemen of fortune, that when we follow the same chase, and\r\ntake the wind out of each other's sails, we think sixty yards of the\r\nsea-beach, and a brace of rifles, are no bad way of making our odds\r\neven.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand you, Captain Cleveland,\" said Mordaunt.\r\n\r\n\"I do not suppose you do,--I did not suppose you would,\" said the\r\nCaptain; and, turning on his heel, with a smile that resembled a sneer,\r\nMordaunt saw him mingle with the guests, and very soon beheld him at\r\nthe side of Minna, who was talking to him with animated features, that\r\nseemed to thank him for his gallant and generous conduct.\r\n\r\n\"If it were not for Brenda,\" thought Mordaunt, \"I almost wish he had\r\nleft me in the voe, for no one seems to care whether I am alive or\r\ndead.--Two rifles and sixty yards of sea-beach--is that what he points\r\nat?--It may come,--but not on the day he has saved my life with risk of\r\nhis own.\"\r\n\r\nWhile he was thus musing, Eric Scambester was whispering to Halcro, \"If\r\nthese two lads do not do each other a mischief, there is no faith in\r\nfreits. Master Mordaunt saves Cleveland,--well.--Cleveland, in requital,\r\nhas turned all the sunshine of Burgh-Westra to his own side of the\r\nhouse; and think what it is to lose favour in such a house as this,\r\nwhere the punch-kettle is never allowed to cool! Well, now that\r\nCleveland in his turn has been such a fool as to fish Mordaunt out of\r\nthe voe, see if he does not give him sour sillocks for stock-fish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pshaw, pshaw!\" replied the poet, \"that is all old women's fancies, my\r\nfriend Eric; for what says glorious Dryden--sainted John,--\r\n\r\n  'The yellow gall that in your bosom floats,\r\n  Engenders all these melancholy thoughts.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Saint John, or Saint James either, may be mistaken in the matter,\" said\r\nEric; \"for I think neither of them lived in Zetland. I only say, that if\r\nthere is faith in old saws, these two lads will do each other a\r\nmischief; and if they do, I trust it will light on Mordaunt Mertoun.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why, Eric Scambester,\" said Halcro, hastily and angrily, \"should\r\nyou wish ill to that poor young man, that is worth fifty of the other?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let every one roose the ford as he finds it,\" replied Eric; \"Master\r\nMordaunt is all for wan water, like his old dog-fish of a father; now\r\nCaptain Cleveland, d'ye see, takes his glass, like an honest fellow and\r\na gentleman.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rightly reasoned, and in thine own division,\" said Halcro; and breaking\r\noff their conversation, took his way back to Burgh-Westra, to which the\r\nguests of Magnus were now returning, discussing as they went, with much\r\nanimation, the various incidents of their attack upon the whale, and not\r\na little scandalized that it should have baffled all their exertions.\r\n\r\n\"I hope Captain Donderdrecht of the Eintracht of Rotterdam will never\r\nhear of it,\" said Magnus; \"he would swear, donner and blitzen, we were\r\nonly fit to fish flounders.\"[46]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[46] The contest about the whale will remind the poetical reader of\r\nWaller's Battle of the Summer Islands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n  And helter-skelter have I rode to thee,\r\n  And tidings do I bring, and lucky joys,\r\n  And golden times, and happy news of price.\r\n\r\n                                           _Ancient Pistol._\r\n\r\n\r\nFortune, who seems at times to bear a conscience, owed the hospitable\r\nUdaller some amends, and accordingly repaid to Burgh-Westra the\r\ndisappointment occasioned by the unsuccessful whale-fishing, by sending\r\nthither, on the evening of the day in which that incident happened, no\r\nless a person than the jagger, or travelling merchant, as he styled\r\nhimself, Bryce Snailsfoot, who arrived in great pomp, himself on one\r\npony, and his pack of goods, swelled to nearly double its usual size,\r\nforming the burden of another, which was led by a bare-headed\r\nbare-legged boy.\r\n\r\nAs Bryce announced himself the bearer of important news, he was\r\nintroduced to the dining apartment, where (for that primitive age was no\r\nrespecter of persons) he was permitted to sit down at a side-table, and\r\namply supplied with provisions and good liquor; while the attentive\r\nhospitality of Magnus permitted no questions to be put to him, until,\r\nhis hunger and thirst appeased, he announced, with the sense of\r\nimportance attached to distant travels, that he had just yesterday\r\narrived at Lerwick from Kirkwall, the capital of Orkney, and would have\r\nbeen here yesterday, but it blew hard off the Fitful-head.\r\n\r\n\"We had no wind here,\" said Magnus.\r\n\r\n\"There is somebody has not been sleeping, then,\" said the pedlar, \"and\r\nher name begins with N; but Heaven is above all.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the news from Orkney, Bryce, instead of croaking about a capful of\r\nwind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Such news,\" replied Bryce, \"as has not been heard this thirty\r\nyears--not since Cromwell's time.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is not another Revolution, is there?\" said Halcro; \"King James\r\nhas not come back, as blithe as King Charlie did, has he?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's news,\" replied the pedlar, \"that are worth twenty kings, and\r\nkingdoms to boot of them; for what good did the evolutions ever do us?\r\nand I dare say we have seen a dozen, great and sma'.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are any Indiamen come north about?\" said Magnus Troil.\r\n\r\n\"Ye are nearer the mark, Fowd,\" said the jagger; \"but it is nae\r\nIndiaman, but a gallant armed vessel, chokeful of merchandise, that they\r\npart with so easy that a decent man like my sell can afford to give the\r\ncountry the best pennyworths you ever saw; and that you will say, when I\r\nopen that pack, for I count to carry it back another sort lighter than\r\nwhen I brought it here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay, Bryce,\" said the Udaller, \"you must have had good bargains if\r\nyou sell cheap; but what ship was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cannot justly say--I spoke to nobody but the captain, who was a\r\ndiscreet man; but she had been down on the Spanish Main, for she has\r\nsilks and satins, and tobacco, I warrant you, and wine, and no lack of\r\nsugar, and bonny-wallies baith of silver and gowd, and a bonnie\r\ndredging of gold dust into the bargain.\"\r\n\r\n\"What like was she?\" said Cleveland, who seemed to give much attention.\r\n\r\n\"A stout ship,\" said the itinerant merchant, \"schooner-rigged, sails\r\nlike a dolphin, they say, carries twelve guns, and is pierced for\r\ntwenty.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear the captain's name?\" said Cleveland, speaking rather lower\r\nthan his usual tone.\r\n\r\n\"I just ca'd him the Captain,\" replied Bryce Snailsfoot; \"for I make it\r\na rule never to ask questions of them I deal with in the way of trade;\r\nfor there is many an honest captain, begging your pardon, Captain\r\nCleveland, that does not care to have his name tacked to his title; and\r\nas lang as we ken what bargains we are making, what signifies it wha we\r\nare making them wi', ye ken?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bryce Snailsfoot is a cautious man,\" said the Udaller, laughing; \"he\r\nknows a fool may ask more questions than a wise man cares to answer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have dealt with the fair traders in my day,\" replied Snailsfoot, \"and\r\nI ken nae use in blurting braid out with a man's name at every moment;\r\nbut I will uphold this gentleman to be a gallant commander--ay, and a\r\nkind one too; for every one of his crew is as brave in apparel as\r\nhimself nearly--the very foremast-men have their silken scarfs; I have\r\nseen many a lady wear a warse, and think hersell nae sma' drink--and for\r\nsiller buttons, and buckles, and the lave of sic vanities, there is nae\r\nend of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Idiots!\" muttered Cleveland between his teeth; and then added, \"I\r\nsuppose they are often ashore, to show all their bravery to the lasses\r\nof Kirkwall?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ne'er a bit of that are they. The Captain will scarce let them stir\r\nashore without the boatswain go in the boat--as rough a tarpaulin as\r\never swabb'd a deck--and you may as weel catch a cat without her claws,\r\nas him without his cutlass and his double brace of pistols about him;\r\nevery man stands as much in awe of him as of the commander himsell.\"\r\n\r\n\"That must be Hawkins, or the devil,\" said Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\"Aweel, Captain,\" replied the jagger, \"be he the tane or the tither, or\r\na wee bit o' baith, mind it is you that give him these names, and not\r\nI.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Captain Cleveland,\" said the Udaller, \"this may prove the very\r\nconsort you spoke of.\"\r\n\r\n\"They must have had some good luck, then,\" said Cleveland, \"to put them\r\nin better plight than when I left them.--Did they speak of having lost\r\ntheir consort, pedlar?\"\r\n\r\n\"In troth did they,\" said Bryce; \"that is, they said something about a\r\npartner that had gone down to Davie Jones in these seas.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did you tell them what you knew of her?\" said the Udaller.\r\n\r\n\"And wha the deevil wad hae been the fule, then,\" said the pedlar, \"that\r\nI suld say sae? When they kend what came of the ship, the next question\r\nwad have been about the cargo,--and ye wad not have had me bring down an\r\narmed vessel on the coast, to harrie the poor folk about a wheen rags of\r\nduds that the sea flung upon their shores?\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides, what might have been found in your own pack, you scoundrel!\"\r\nsaid Magnus Troil; an observation which produced a loud laugh. The\r\nUdaller could not help joining in the hilarity which applauded his jest;\r\nbut instantly composing his countenance, he said, in an unusually grave\r\ntone, \"You may laugh, my friends; but this is a matter which brings both\r\na curse and a shame on the country; and till we learn to regard the\r\nrights of them that suffer by the winds and waves, we shall deserve to\r\nbe oppressed and hag-ridden, as we have been and are, by the superior\r\nstrength of the strangers who rule us.\"\r\n\r\nThe company hung their heads at the rebuke of Magnus Troil. Perhaps\r\nsome, even of the better class, might be conscience-struck on their own\r\naccount; and all of them were sensible that the appetite for plunder, on\r\nthe part of the tenants and inferiors, was not at all times restrained\r\nwith sufficient strictness. But Cleveland made answer gaily, \"If these\r\nhonest fellows be my comrades, I will answer for them that they will\r\nnever trouble the country about a parcel of chests, hammocks, and such\r\ntrumpery, that the Roost may have washed ashore out of my poor sloop.\r\nWhat signifies to them whether the trash went to Bryce Snailsfoot, or to\r\nthe bottom, or to the devil? So unbuckle thy pack, Bryce, and show the\r\nladies thy cargo, and perhaps we may see something that will please\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"It cannot be his consort,\" said Brenda, in a whisper to her sister; \"he\r\nwould have shown more joy at her appearance.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must be the vessel,\" answered Minna; \"I saw his eye glisten at the\r\nthought of being again united to the partner of his dangers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps it glistened,\" said her sister, still apart, \"at the thought of\r\nleaving Zetland; it is difficult to guess the thought of the heart from\r\nthe glance of the eye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Judge not, at least, unkindly of a friend's thought,\" said Minna; \"and\r\nthen, Brenda, if you are mistaken, the fault rests not with you.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this dialogue, Bryce Snailsfoot was busied in uncoiling the\r\ncarefully arranged cordage of his pack, which amounted to six good yards\r\nof dressed seal-skin, curiously complicated and secured by all manner of\r\nknots and buckles. He was considerably interrupted in the task by the\r\nUdaller and others, who pressed him with questions respecting the\r\nstranger vessel.\r\n\r\n\"Were the officers often ashore? and how were they received by the\r\npeople of Kirkwall?\" said Magnus Troil.\r\n\r\n\"Excellently well,\" answered Bryce Snailsfoot; \"and the Captain and one\r\nor two of his men had been at some of the vanities and dances which went\r\nforward in the town; but there had been some word about customs, or\r\nking's duties, or the like, and some of the higher folk, that took upon\r\nthem as magistrates, or the like, had had words with the Captain, and he\r\nrefused to satisfy them; and then it is like he was more coldly looked\r\non, and he spoke of carrying the ship round to Stromness, or the\r\nLanghope, for she lay under the guns of the battery at Kirkwall. But he\"\r\n(Bryce) \"thought she wad bide at Kirkwall till the summer-fair was over,\r\nfor all that.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Orkney gentry,\" said Magnus Troil, \"are always in a hurry to draw\r\nthe Scotch collar tighter round their own necks. Is it not enough that\r\nwe must pay _scat_ and _wattle,_ which were all the public dues under\r\nour old Norse government; but must they come over us with king's dues\r\nand customs besides? It is the part of an honest man to resist these\r\nthings. I have done so all my life, and will do so to the end of it.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a loud jubilee and shout of applause among the guests, who\r\nwere (some of them at least) better pleased with Magnus Troil's\r\nlatitudinarian principles with respect to the public revenue, (which\r\nwere extremely natural to those living in so secluded a situation, and\r\nsubjected to many additional exactions,) than they had been with the\r\nrigour of his judgment on the subject of wrecked goods. But Minna's\r\ninexperienced feelings carried her farther than her father, while she\r\nwhispered to Brenda, not unheard by Cleveland, that the tame spirit of\r\nthe Orcadians had missed every chance which late incidents had given\r\nthem to emancipate these islands from the Scottish yoke.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" she said, \"should we not, under so many changes as late times\r\nhave introduced, have seized the opportunity to shake off an allegiance\r\nwhich is not justly due from us, and to return to the protection of\r\nDenmark, our parent country? Why should we yet hesitate to do this, but\r\nthat the gentry of Orkney have mixed families and friendship so much\r\nwith our invaders, that they have become dead to the throb of the heroic\r\nNorse blood, which they derived from their ancestors?\"\r\n\r\nThe latter part of this patriotic speech happened to reach the\r\nastonished ears of our friend Triptolemus, who, having a sincere\r\ndevotion for the Protestant succession, and the Revolution as\r\nestablished, was surprised into the ejaculation, \"As the old cock crows\r\nthe young cock learns--hen I should say, mistress, and I crave your\r\npardon if I say any thing amiss in either gender. But it is a happy\r\ncountry where the father declares against the king's customs, and the\r\ndaughter against the king's crown! and, in my judgment, it can end in\r\nnaething but trees and tows.\"\r\n\r\n\"Trees are scarce among us,\" said Magnus; \"and for ropes, we need them\r\nfor our rigging, and cannot spare them to be shirt-collars.\"\r\n\r\n\"And whoever,\" said the Captain, \"takes umbrage at what this young lady\r\nsays, had better keep his ears and tongue for a safer employment than\r\nsuch an adventure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay,\" said Triptolemus, \"it helps the matter much to speak truths,\r\nwhilk are as unwelcome to a proud stomach as wet clover to a cow's, in a\r\nland where lads are ready to draw the whittle if a lassie but looks\r\nawry. But what manners are to be expected in a country where folk call a\r\npleugh-sock a markal?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hark ye, Master Yellowley,\" said the Captain, smiling, \"I hope my\r\nmanners are not among those abuses which you come hither to reform; any\r\nexperiment on them may be dangerous.\"\r\n\r\n\"As well as difficult,\" said Triptolemus, dryly; \"but fear nothing,\r\nCaptain Cleveland, from my remonstrances. My labours regard the men and\r\nthings of the earth, and not the men and things of the sea,--you are not\r\nof my element.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us be friends, then, old clod-compeller,\" said the Captain.\r\n\r\n\"Clod-compeller!\" said the agriculturist, bethinking himself of the\r\nlore of his earlier days; \"Clod-compeller _pro_ cloud-compeller,\r\n[Greek: Nephelêgeréta Zeus](_o_)--_Græcum est_,--in which voyage came\r\nyou by that phrase?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have travelled books as well as seas in my day,\" said the Captain;\r\n\"but my last voyages have been of a sort to make me forget my early\r\ncruizes through classic knowledge.--But come here, Bryce,--hast cast off\r\nthe lashing?--Come all hands, and let us see if he has aught in his\r\ncargo that is worth looking upon.\"\r\n\r\nWith a proud, and, at the same time, a wily smile, did the crafty pedlar\r\ndisplay a collection of wares far superior to those which usually filled\r\nhis packages, and, in particular, some stuffs and embroideries, of such\r\nbeauty and curiosity, fringed, flowered, and worked, with such art and\r\nmagnificence, upon foreign and arabesque patterns, that the sight might\r\nhave dazzled a far more brilliant company than the simple race of Thule.\r\nAll beheld and admired, while Mistress Baby Yellowley, holding up her\r\nhands, protested it was a sin even to look upon such extravagance, and\r\nworse than murder so much as to ask the price of them.\r\n\r\nOthers, however, were more courageous; and the prices demanded by the\r\nmerchant, if they were not, as he himself declared, something just more\r\nthan nothing--short only of an absolute free gift of his wares, were\r\nnevertheless so moderate, as to show that he himself must have made an\r\neasy acquisition of the goods, judging by the rate at which he offered\r\nto part with them. Accordingly, the cheapness of the articles created a\r\nrapid sale; for in Zetland, as well as elsewhere, wise folk buy more\r\nfrom the prudential desire to secure a good bargain, than from any real\r\noccasion for the purchase. The Lady Glowrowrum bought seven petticoats\r\nand twelve stomachers on this sole principle, and other matrons present\r\nrivalled her in this sagacious species of economy. The Udaller was also\r\na considerable purchaser; but the principal customer for whatever could\r\nplease the eye of beauty, was the gallant Captain Cleveland, who\r\nrummaged the jagger's stores in selecting presents for the ladies of the\r\nparty, in which Minna and Brenda Troil were especially remembered.\r\n\r\n\"I fear,\" said Magnus Troil, \"that the young women are to consider these\r\npretty presents as keepsakes, and that all this liberality is only a\r\nsure sign we are soon to lose you?\"\r\n\r\nThis question seemed to embarrass him to whom it was put.\r\n\r\n\"I scarce know,\" he said with some hesitation, \"whether this vessel is\r\nmy consort or no--I must take a trip to Kirkwall to make sure of that\r\nmatter, and then I hope to return to Dunrossness to bid you all\r\nfarewell.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" said the Udaller, after a moment's pause, \"I think I may\r\ncarry you thither. I should be at the Kirkwall fair, to settle with the\r\nmerchants I have consigned my fish to, and I have often promised Minna\r\nand Brenda that they should see the fair. Perhaps also your consort, or\r\nthese strangers, whoever they be, may have some merchandise that will\r\nsuit me. I love to see my rigging-loft well stocked with goods, almost\r\nas much as to see it full of dancers. We will go to Orkney in my own\r\nbrig, and I can offer you a hammock, if you will.\"\r\n\r\nThe offer seemed so acceptable to Cleveland, that, after pouring himself\r\nforth in thanks, he seemed determined to mark his joy by exhausting\r\nBryce Snailsfoot's treasures in liberality to the company. The contents\r\nof a purse of gold were transferred to the jagger, with a facility and\r\nindifference on the part of its former owner which argued either the\r\ngreatest profusion, or consciousness of superior and inexhaustible\r\nwealth; so that Baby whispered to her brother, that, \"if he could afford\r\nto fling away money at this rate, the lad had made a better voyage in a\r\nbroken ship, than all the skippers of Dundee had made in their haill\r\nanes for a twelvemonth past.\"\r\n\r\nBut the angry feeling in which she made this remark was much mollified,\r\nwhen Cleveland, whose object it seemed that evening to be, to buy golden\r\nopinions of all sorts of men, approached her with a garment somewhat\r\nresembling in shape the Scottish plaid, but woven of a sort of wool so\r\nsoft, that it felt to the touch as if it were composed of eider-down.\r\n\"This,\" he said, \"was a part of a Spanish lady's dress, called a\r\n_mantilla_; as it would exactly fit the size of Mrs. Baby Yellowley, and\r\nwas very well suited for the fogs of the climate of Zetland, he\r\nentreated her to wear it for his sake.\" The lady, with as much\r\ncondescending sweetness as her countenance was able to express, not only\r\nconsented to receive this mark of gallantry, but permitted the donor to\r\narrange the mantilla upon her projecting and bony shoulder-blades,\r\nwhere, said Claud Halcro, \"it hung, for all the world, as if it had been\r\nstretched betwixt a couple of cloak-pins.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the Captain was performing this piece of courtesy, much to the\r\nentertainment of the company, which, it may be presumed, was his\r\nprincipal object from the beginning, Mordaunt Mertoun made purchase of a\r\nsmall golden chaplet, with the private intention of presenting it to\r\nBrenda, when he should find an opportunity. The price was fixed, and the\r\narticle laid aside. Claud Halcro also showed some desire of possessing a\r\nsilver box of antique shape, for depositing tobacco, which he was in the\r\nhabit of using in considerable quantity. But the bard seldom had current\r\ncoin in promptitude, and, indeed, in his wandering way of life, had\r\nlittle occasion for any; and Bryce, on the other hand, his having been\r\nhitherto a ready-money trade, protested, that his very moderate profits\r\nupon such rare and choice articles, would not allow of his affording\r\ncredit to the purchaser. Mordaunt gathered the import of this\r\nconversation from the mode in which they whispered together, while the\r\nbard seemed to advance a wishful finger towards the box in question, and\r\nthe cautious pedlar detained it with the weight of his whole hand, as if\r\nhe had been afraid it would literally make itself wings, and fly into\r\nClaud Halcro's pocket. Mordaunt Mertoun at this moment, desirous to\r\ngratify an old acquaintance, laid the price of the box on the table, and\r\nsaid he would not permit Master Halcro to purchase that box, as he had\r\nsettled in his own mind to make him a present of it.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot think of robbing you, my dear young friend,\" said the poet;\r\n\"but the truth is, that that same box does remind me strangely of\r\nglorious John's, out of which I had the honour to take a pinch at the\r\nWits' Coffeehouse, for which I think more highly of my right-hand finger\r\nand thumb than any other part of my body; only you must allow me to pay\r\nyou back the price when my Urkaster stock-fish come to market.\"\r\n\r\n\"Settle that as you like betwixt you,\" said the jagger, taking up\r\nMordaunt's money; \"the box is bought and sold.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how dare you sell over again,\" said Captain Cleveland, suddenly\r\ninterfering, \"what you already have sold to me?\"\r\n\r\nAll were surprised at this interjection, which was hastily made, as\r\nCleveland, having turned from Mistress Baby, had become suddenly, and,\r\nas it seemed, not without emotion, aware what articles Bryce Snailsfoot\r\nwas now disposing of. To this short and fierce question, the jagger,\r\nafraid to contradict a customer of his description, answered only by\r\nstammering, that the \"Lord knew he meant nae offence.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, sir! no offence!\" said the seaman, \"and dispose of my property?\"\r\nextending his hand at the same time to the box and chaplet; \"restore the\r\nyoung gentleman's money, and learn to keep your course on the meridian\r\nof honesty.\"\r\n\r\nThe jagger, confused and reluctant, pulled out his leathern pouch to\r\nrepay to Mordaunt the money he had just deposited in it; but the youth\r\nwas not to be so satisfied.\r\n\r\n\"The articles,\" he said, \"were bought and sold--these were your own\r\nwords, Bryce Snailsfoot, in Master Halcro's hearing; and I will suffer\r\nneither you nor any other to deprive me of my property.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Your_ property, young man?\" said Cleveland; \"It is mine,--I spoke to\r\nBryce respecting them an instant before I turned from the table.\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I--I had not just heard distinctly,\" said Bryce, evidently unwilling\r\nto offend either party.\r\n\r\n\"Come, come,\" said the Udaller, \"we will have no quarrelling about\r\nbaubles; we shall be summoned presently to the rigging-loft,\"--so he\r\nused to call the apartment used as a ball-room,--\"and we must all go in\r\ngood-humour. The things shall remain with Bryce for to-night, and\r\nto-morrow I will myself settle whom they shall belong to.\"\r\n\r\nThe laws of the Udaller in his own house were absolute as those of the\r\nMedes. The two young men, regarding each other with looks of sullen\r\ndispleasure, drew off in different directions.\r\n\r\nIt is seldom that the second day of a prolonged festival equals the\r\nfirst. The spirits, as well as the limbs, are jaded, and unequal to the\r\nrenewed expenditure of animation and exertion; and the dance at\r\nBurgh-Westra was sustained with much less mirth than on the preceding\r\nevening. It was yet an hour from midnight, when even the reluctant\r\nMagnus Troil, after regretting the degeneracy of the times, and wishing\r\nhe could transfuse into the modern Hialtlanders some of the vigour which\r\nstill animated his own frame, found himself compelled to give the signal\r\nfor general retreat.\r\n\r\nJust as this took place, Halcro, leading Mordaunt Mertoun a little\r\naside, said he had a message to him from Captain Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\"A message!\" said Mordaunt, his heart beating somewhat thick as he\r\nspoke--\"A challenge, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"A challenge!\" repeated Halcro; \"who ever heard of a challenge in our\r\nquiet islands? Do you think that I look like a carrier of challenges,\r\nand to you of all men living?--I am none of those fighting fools, as\r\nglorious John calls them; and it was not quite a message I had to\r\ndeliver--only thus far--this Captain Cleveland, I find, hath set his\r\nheart upon having these articles you looked at.\"\r\n\r\n\"He shall not have them, I swear to you,\" replied Mordaunt Mertoun.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, but hear me,\" said Halcro; \"it seems that, by the marks or arms\r\nthat are upon them, he knows that they were formerly his property. Now,\r\nwere you to give me the box, as you promised, I fairly tell you, I\r\nshould give the man back his own.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Brenda might do the like,\" thought Mordaunt to himself, and\r\ninstantly replied aloud, \"I have thought better of it, my friend.\r\nCaptain Cleveland shall have the toys he sets such store by, but it is\r\non one sole condition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, you will spoil all with your conditions,\" said Halcro; \"for, as\r\nglorious John says, conditions are but\"----\r\n\r\n\"Hear me, I say, with patience.--My condition is, that he keeps the toys\r\nin exchange for the rifle-gun I accepted from him, which will leave no\r\nobligation between us on either side.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see where you would be--this is Sebastian and Dorax all over. Well,\r\nyou may let the jagger know he is to deliver the things to Cleveland--I\r\nthink he is mad to have them--and I will let Cleveland know the\r\nconditions annexed, otherwise honest Bryce might come by two payments\r\ninstead of one; and I believe his conscience would not choke upon it.\"\r\n\r\nWith these words, Halcro went to seek out Cleveland, while Mordaunt,\r\nobserving Snailsfoot, who, as a sort of privileged person, had thrust\r\nhimself into the crowd at the bottom of the dancing-room, went up to\r\nhim, and gave him directions to deliver the disputed articles to\r\nCleveland as soon as he had an opportunity.\r\n\r\n\"Ye are in the right, Maister Mordaunt,\" said the jagger; \"ye are a\r\nprudent and a sensible lad--a calm answer turneth away wrath--and\r\nmysell, I sall be willing to please you in ony trifling matters in my\r\nsma' way; for, between the Udaller of Burgh-Westra and Captain\r\nCleveland, a man is, as it were, atween the deil and the deep sea; and\r\nit was like that the Udaller, in the end, would have taken your part in\r\nthe dispute, for he is a man that loves justice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which apparently you care very little about, Master Snailsfoot,\" said\r\nMordaunt, \"otherwise there could have been no dispute whatever, the\r\nright being so clearly on my side, if you had pleased to bear witness\r\naccording to the dictates of truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maister Mordaunt,\" said the jagger, \"I must own there was, as it were,\r\na colouring or shadow of justice on your side; but then, the justice\r\nthat I meddle with, is only justice in the way of trade, to have an\r\nellwand of due length, if it be not something worn out with leaning on\r\nit in my lang and painful journeys, and to buy and sell by just weight\r\nand measure, twenty-four merks to the lispund; but I have nothing to do,\r\nto do justice betwixt man and man, like a Fowd or a Lawright-man at a\r\nlawting lang syne.\"\r\n\r\n\"No one asked you to do so, but only to give evidence according to your\r\nconscience,\" replied Mordaunt, not greatly pleased either with the part\r\nthe jagger had acted during the dispute, or the construction which he\r\nseemed to put on his own motives for yielding up the point.\r\n\r\nBut Bryce Snailsfoot wanted not his answer; \"My conscience,\" he said,\r\n\"Maister Mordaunt, is as tender as ony man's in my degree; but she is\r\nsomething of a timorsome nature, cannot abide angry folk, and can never\r\nspeak above her breath, when there is aught of a fray going forward.\r\nIndeed, she hath at all times a small and low voice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which you are not much in the habit of listening to,\" said Mordaunt.\r\n\r\n\"There is that on your ain breast that proves the contrary,\" said Bryce,\r\nresolutely.\r\n\r\n\"In my breast?\" said Mordaunt, somewhat angrily,--\"what know I of you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I said _on_ your breast, Maister Mordaunt, and not _in_ it. I am sure\r\nnae eye that looks on that waistcoat upon your own gallant brisket, but\r\nwill say, that the merchant who sold such a piece for four dollars had\r\njustice and conscience, and a kind heart to a customer to the boot of a'\r\nthat; sae ye shouldna be sae thrawart wi' me for having spared the\r\nbreath of my mouth in a fool's quarrel.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thrawart!\" said Mordaunt; \"pooh, you silly man! I have no quarrel\r\nwith you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad of it,\" said the travelling merchant; \"I will quarrel with no\r\nman, with my will--least of all with an old customer; and if you will\r\nwalk by my advice, you will quarrel nane with Captain Cleveland. He is\r\nlike one of yon cutters and slashers that have come into Kirkwall, that\r\nthink as little of slicing a man, as we do of flinching a whale--it's\r\ntheir trade to fight, and they live by it; and they have the advantage\r\nof the like of you, that only take it up at your own hand, and in the\r\nway of pastime, when you hae nothing better to do.\"\r\n\r\nThe company had now almost all dispersed; and Mordaunt, laughing at the\r\njagger's caution, bade him good-night, and went to his own place of\r\nrepose, which had been assigned to him by Eric Scambester, (who acted\r\nthe part of chamberlain as well as butler,) in a small room, or rather\r\ncloset, in one of the outhouses, furnished for the occasion with the\r\nhammock of a sailor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n  I pass like night from land to land,\r\n    I have strange power of speech;\r\n  So soon as e'er his face I see,\r\n  I know the man that must hear me,\r\n    To him my tale I teach.\r\n\r\n                  COLERIDGE'S _Rime of the Ancient Mariner_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe daughters of Magnus Troil shared the same bed, in a chamber which\r\nhad been that of their parents before the death of their mother. Magnus,\r\nwho suffered grievously under that dispensation of Providence, had\r\nbecome disgusted with the apartment. The nuptial chamber was abandoned\r\nto the pledges of his bereaved affection, of whom the eldest was at that\r\nperiod only four years old, or thereabouts; and, having been their\r\nnursery in infancy, continued, though now tricked and adorned according\r\nto the best fashion of the islands, and the taste of the lovely sisters\r\nthemselves, to be their sleeping-room, or, in the old Norse dialect,\r\ntheir bower.\r\n\r\nIt had been for many years the scene of the most intimate confidence, if\r\nthat could be called confidence, where, in truth, there was nothing to\r\nbe confided; where neither sister had a secret; and where every thought\r\nthat had birth in the bosom of the one, was, without either hesitation\r\nor doubt, confided to the other as spontaneously as it had arisen. But,\r\nsince Cleveland abode in the mansion of Burgh-Westra, each of the lovely\r\nsisters had entertained thoughts which are not lightly or easily\r\ncommunicated, unless she who listens to them has previously assured\r\nherself that the confidence will be kindly received. Minna had noticed\r\nwhat other and less interested observers had been unable to perceive,\r\nthat Cleveland, namely, held a lower rank in Brenda's opinion than in\r\nher own; and Brenda, on her side, thought that Minna had hastily and\r\nunjustly joined in the prejudices which had been excited against\r\nMordaunt Mertoun in the mind of their father. Each was sensible that she\r\nwas no longer the same to her sister; and this conviction was a painful\r\naddition to other painful apprehensions which they supposed they had to\r\nstruggle with. Their manner towards each other was, in outward\r\nappearances, and in all the little cares by which affection can be\r\nexpressed, even more assiduously kind than before, as if both, conscious\r\nthat their internal reserve was a breach of their sisterly union, strove\r\nto atone for it by double assiduity in those external marks of\r\naffection, which, at other times, when there was nothing to hide, might\r\nbe omitted without inferring any consequences.\r\n\r\nOn the night referred to in particular, the sisters felt more especially\r\nthe decay of the confidence which used to exist betwixt them. The\r\nproposed voyage to Kirkwall, and that at the time of the fair, when\r\npersons of every degree in these islands repair thither, either for\r\nbusiness or amusement, was likely to be an important incident in lives\r\nusually so simple and uniform as theirs; and, a few months ago, Minna\r\nand Brenda would have been awake half the night, anticipating, in their\r\ntalk with each other, all that was likely to happen on so momentous an\r\noccasion. But now the subject was just mentioned, and suffered to drop,\r\nas if the topic was likely to produce a difference betwixt them, or to\r\ncall forth a more open display of their several opinions than either was\r\nwilling to make to the other.\r\n\r\nYet such was their natural openness and gentleness of disposition, that\r\neach sister imputed to herself the fault that there was aught like\r\nestrangement existing between them; and when, having finished their\r\ndevotions, and betaken themselves to their common couch, they folded\r\neach other in their arms, and exchanged a sisterly kiss, and a sisterly\r\ngood-night, they seemed mutually to ask pardon, and to exchange\r\nforgiveness, although neither said a word of offence, either offered or\r\nreceived; and both were soon plunged in that light and yet profound\r\nrepose, which is only enjoyed when sleep sinks down on the eyes of youth\r\nand innocence.\r\n\r\nOn the night to which the story relates, both sisters were visited by\r\ndreams, which, though varied by the moods and habits of the sleepers,\r\nbore yet a strange general resemblance to each other.\r\n\r\nMinna dreamed that she was in one of the most lonely recesses of the\r\nbeach, called Swartaster, where the incessant operation of the waves,\r\nindenting a calcarious rock, has formed a deep _halier_, which, in the\r\nlanguage of the island, means a subterranean cavern, into which the tide\r\nebbs and flows. Many of these run to an extraordinary and unascertained\r\ndepth under ground, and are the secure retreat of cormorants and seals,\r\nwhich it is neither easy nor safe to pursue to their extreme recesses.\r\nAmongst these, this halier of Swartaster was accounted peculiarly\r\ninaccessible, and shunned both by fowlers and by seamen, on account of\r\nsharp angles and turnings in the cave itself, as well as the sunken\r\nrocks which rendered it very dangerous for skiffs or boats to advance\r\nfar into it, especially if there was the usual swell of an island tide.\r\nFrom the dark-browed mouth of this cavern, it seemed to Minna, in her\r\ndream, that she beheld a mermaid issue, not in the classical dress of a\r\nNereid, as in Claud Halcro's mask of the preceding evening, but with\r\ncomb and glass in hand, according to popular belief, and lashing the\r\nwaves with that long scaly train, which, in the traditions of the\r\ncountry, forms so frightful a contrast with the fair face, long tresses,\r\nand displayed bosom, of a human and earthly female, of surpassing\r\nbeauty. She seemed to beckon to Minna, while her wild notes rang sadly\r\nin her ear, and denounced, in prophetic sounds, calamity and woe.\r\n\r\nThe vision of Brenda was of a different description, yet equally\r\nmelancholy. She sat, as she thought, in her favourite bower, surrounded\r\nby her father and a party of his most beloved friends, amongst whom\r\nMordaunt Mertoun was not forgotten. She was required to sing; and she\r\nstrove to entertain them with a lively ditty, in which she was accounted\r\neminently successful, and which she sung with such simple, yet natural\r\nhumour, as seldom failed to produce shouts of laughter and applause,\r\nwhile all who could, or who could not sing, were irresistibly compelled\r\nto lend their voices to the chorus. But, on this occasion, it seemed as\r\nif her own voice refused all its usual duty, and as if, while she felt\r\nherself unable to express the words of the well-known air, it assumed,\r\nin her own despite, the deep tones and wild and melancholy notes of\r\nNorna of Fitful-head, for the purpose of chanting some wild Runic rhyme,\r\nresembling those sung by the heathen priests of old, when the victim\r\n(too often human) was bound to the fatal altar of Odin or of Thor.\r\n\r\nAt length the two sisters at once started from sleep, and, uttering a\r\nlow scream of fear, clasped themselves in each other's arms. For their\r\nfancy had not altogether played them false; the sounds, which had\r\nsuggested their dreams, were real, and sung within their apartment. They\r\nknew the voice well, indeed, and yet, knowing to whom it belonged, their\r\nsurprise and fear were scarce the less, when they saw the well-known\r\nNorna of Fitful-head, seated by the chimney of the apartment, which,\r\nduring the summer season, contained an iron lamp well trimmed, and, in\r\nwinter, a fire of wood or of turf.\r\n\r\nShe was wrapped in her long and ample garment of wadmaal, and moved her\r\nbody slowly to and fro over the pale flame of the lamp, as she sung\r\nlines to the following purport, in a slow, sad, and almost an unearthly\r\naccent:\r\n\r\n  \"For leagues along the watery way,\r\n    Through gulf and stream my course has been;\r\n  The billows know my Runic lay,\r\n    And smooth their crests to silent green.\r\n\r\n  \"The billows know my Runic lay,--\r\n    The gulf grows smooth, the stream is still;\r\n  But human hearts, more wild than they,\r\n    Know but the rule of wayward will.\r\n\r\n  \"One hour is mine, in all the year,\r\n    To tell my woes,--and one alone;\r\n  When gleams this magic lamp, 'tis here,--\r\n    When dies the mystic light, 'tis gone.\r\n\r\n  \"Daughters of northern Magnus, hail!\r\n    The lamp is lit, the flame is clear,--\r\n  To you I come to tell my tale,\r\n    Awake, arise, my tale to hear!\"\r\n\r\nNorna was well known to the daughters of Troil, but it was not without\r\nemotion, although varied by their respective dispositions, that they\r\nbeheld her so unexpectedly, and at such an hour. Their opinions with\r\nrespect to the supernatural attributes to which she pretended, were\r\nextremely different.\r\n\r\nMinna, with an unusual intensity of imagination, although superior in\r\ntalent to her sister, was more apt to listen to, and delight in, every\r\ntale of wonder, and was at all times more willing to admit impressions\r\nwhich gave her fancy scope and exercise, without minutely examining\r\ntheir reality. Brenda, on the other hand, had, in her gaiety, a slight\r\npropensity to satire, and was often tempted to laugh at the very\r\ncircumstances upon which Minna founded her imaginative dreams; and, like\r\nall who love the ludicrous, she did not readily suffer herself to be\r\nimposed upon, or overawed, by pompous pretensions of any kind whatever.\r\nBut, as her nerves were weaker and more irritable than those of her\r\nsister, she often paid involuntary homage, by her fears, to ideas which\r\nher reason disowned; and hence, Claud Halcro used to say, in reference\r\nto many of the traditionary superstitions around Burgh-Westra, that\r\nMinna believed them without trembling, and that Brenda trembled without\r\nbelieving them. In our own more enlightened days, there are few whose\r\nundoubting mind and native courage have not felt Minna's high wrought\r\ntone of enthusiasm; and perhaps still fewer, who have not, at one time\r\nor other, felt, like Brenda, their nerves confess the influence of\r\nterrors which their reason disowned and despised.\r\n\r\nUnder the power of such different feelings, Minna, when the first moment\r\nof surprise was over, prepared to spring from her bed, and go to greet\r\nNorna, who, she doubted not, had come on some errand fraught with fate;\r\nwhile Brenda, who only beheld in her a woman partially deranged in her\r\nunderstanding, and who yet, from the extravagance of her claims,\r\nregarded her as an undefined object of awe, or rather terror, detained\r\nher sister by an eager and terrified grasp, while she whispered in her\r\near an anxious entreaty that she would call for assistance. But the soul\r\nof Minna was too highly wrought up by the crisis at which her fate\r\nseemed to have arrived, to permit her to follow the dictates of her\r\nsister's fears; and, extricating herself from Brenda's hold, she hastily\r\nthrew on a loose nightgown, and, stepping boldly across the apartment,\r\nwhile her heart throbbed rather with high excitement than with fear, she\r\nthus addressed her singular visitor:\r\n\r\n\"Norna, if your mission regards us, as your words seem to express, there\r\nis one of us, at least, who will receive its import with reverence, but\r\nwithout fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"Norna, dear Norna,\" said the tremulous voice of Brenda,--who, feeling\r\nno safety in the bed after Minna quitted it, had followed her, as\r\nfugitives crowd into the rear of an advancing army, because they dare\r\nnot remain behind, and who now stood half concealed by her sister, and\r\nholding fast by the skirts of her gown,--\"Norna, dear Norna,\" said she,\r\n\"whatever you are to say, let it be to-morrow. I will call Euphane Fea,\r\nthe housekeeper, and she will find you a bed for the night.\"\r\n\r\n\"No bed for me!\" said their nocturnal visitor; \"no closing of the eyes\r\nfor me! They have watched as shelf and stack appeared and disappeared\r\nbetwixt Burgh-Westra and Orkney--they have seen the Man of Hoy sink\r\ninto the sea, and the Peak of Hengcliff arise from it, and yet they have\r\nnot tasted of slumber; nor must they slumber now till my task is ended.\r\nSit down, then, Minna, and thou, silly trembler, sit down, while I trim\r\nmy lamp--Don your clothes, for the tale is long, and ere 'tis done, ye\r\nwill shiver with worse than cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"For Heaven's sake, then, put it off till daylight, dear Norna!\" said\r\nBrenda; \"the dawn cannot be far distant; and if you are to tell us of\r\nany thing frightful, let it be by daylight, and not by the dim glimmer\r\nof that blue lamp!\"\r\n\r\n\"Patience, fool!\" said their uninvited guest. \"Not by daylight should\r\nNorna tell a tale that might blot the sun out of heaven, and blight the\r\nhopes of the hundred boats that will leave this shore ere noon, to\r\ncommence their deep-sea fishing,--ay, and of the hundred families that\r\nwill await their return. The demon, whom the sounds will not fail to\r\nawaken, must shake his dark wings over a shipless and a boatless sea, as\r\nhe rushes from his mountain to drink the accents of horror he loves so\r\nwell to listen to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have pity on Brenda's fears, good Norna,\" said the elder sister, \"and\r\nat least postpone this frightful communication to another place and\r\nhour.\"\r\n\r\n\"Maiden, no!\" replied Norna, sternly; \"it must be told while that lamp\r\nyet burns. Mine is no daylight tale--by that lamp it must be told, which\r\nis framed out of the gibbet-irons of the cruel Lord of Wodensvoe, who\r\nmurdered his brother; and has for its nourishment--but be that\r\nnameless--enough that its food never came either from the fish or from\r\nthe fruit!--See, it waxes dim and dimmer, nor must my tale last longer\r\nthan its flame endureth. Sit ye down there, while I sit here opposite\r\nto you, and place the lamp betwixt us; for within the sphere of its\r\nlight the demon dares not venture.\"\r\n\r\nThe sisters obeyed, Minna casting a slow awestruck, yet determined look\r\nall around, as if to see the Being, who, according to the doubtful words\r\nof Norna, hovered in their neighbourhood; while Brenda's fears were\r\nmingled with some share both of anger and of impatience. Norna paid no\r\nattention to either, but began her story in the following words:--\r\n\r\n\"Ye know, my daughters, that your blood is allied to mine, but in what\r\ndegree ye know not; for there was early hostility betwixt your grandsire\r\nand him who had the misfortune to call me daughter.--Let me term him by\r\nhis Christian name of Erland, for that which marks our relation I dare\r\nnot bestow. Your grandsire Olave, was the brother of Erland. But when\r\nthe wide Udal possessions of their father Rolfe Troil, the most rich and\r\nwell estated of any who descended from the old Norse stock, were divided\r\nbetwixt the brothers, the Fowd gave to Erland his father's lands in\r\nOrkney, and reserved for Olave those of Hialtland. Discord arose between\r\nthe brethren; for Erland held that he was wronged; and when the\r\nLawting,[47] with the Raddmen and Lawright-men, confirmed the\r\ndivision, he went in wrath to Orkney, cursing Hialtland and its\r\ninhabitants--cursing his brother and his blood.\r\n\r\n\"But the love of the rock and of the mountain still wrought on Erland's\r\nmind, and he fixed his dwelling not on the soft hills of Ophir, or the\r\ngreen plains of Gramesey, but in the wild and mountainous Isle of Hoy,\r\nwhose summit rises to the sky like the cliffs of Foulah and of\r\nFeroe.[48] He knew,--that unhappy Erland,--whatever of legendary lore\r\nScald and Bard had left behind them; and to teach me that knowledge,\r\nwhich was to cost us both so dear, was the chief occupation of his old\r\nage. I learned to visit each lonely barrow--each lofty cairn--to tell\r\nits appropriate tale, and to soothe with rhymes in his praise the spirit\r\nof the stern warrior who dwelt within. I knew where the sacrifices were\r\nmade of yore to Thor and to Odin, on what stones the blood of the\r\nvictims flowed--where stood the dark-browed priest--where the crested\r\nchiefs, who consulted the will of the idol--where the more distant crowd\r\nof inferior worshippers, who looked on in awe or in terror. The places\r\nmost shunned by the timid peasants had no terrors for me; I dared walk\r\nin the fairy circle, and sleep by the magic spring.\r\n\r\n\"But, for my misfortune, I was chiefly fond to linger about the Dwarfie\r\nStone, as it is called, a relic of antiquity, which strangers look on\r\nwith curiosity, and the natives with awe. It is a huge fragment of rock,\r\nwhich lies in a broken and rude valley, full of stones and precipices,\r\nin the recesses of the Ward-hill of Hoy. The inside of the rock has two\r\ncouches, hewn by no earthly hand, and having a small passage between\r\nthem. The doorway is now open to the weather; but beside it lies a\r\nlarge stone, which, adapted to grooves still visible in the entrance,\r\nonce had served to open and to close this extraordinary dwelling, which\r\nTrolld, a dwarf famous in the northern Sagas, is said to have framed for\r\nhis own favourite residence. The lonely shepherd avoids the place; for\r\nat sunrise, high noon, or sunset, the misshapen form of the necromantic\r\nowner may sometimes still be seen sitting by the Dwarfie Stone.[49] I\r\nfeared not the apparition, for, Minna, my heart was as bold, and my hand\r\nwas as innocent, as yours. In my childish courage, I was even but too\r\npresumptuous, and the thirst after things unattainable led me, like our\r\nprimitive mother, to desire increase of knowledge, even by prohibited\r\nmeans. I longed to possess the power of the Voluspæ and divining women\r\nof our ancient race; to wield, like them, command over the elements; and\r\nto summon the ghosts of deceased heroes from their caverns, that they\r\nmight recite their daring deeds, and impart to me their hidden\r\ntreasures. Often when watching by the Dwarfie Stone, with mine eyes\r\nfixed on the Ward-hill, which rises above that gloomy valley, I have\r\ndistinguished, among the dark rocks, that wonderful carbuncle,[50](_p_)\r\nwhich gleams ruddy as a furnace to them who view it from beneath, but\r\nhas ever become invisible to him whose daring foot has scaled the\r\nprecipices from which it darts its splendour. My vain and youthful bosom\r\nburned to investigate these and an hundred other mysteries, which the\r\nSagas that I perused, or learned from Erland, rather indicated than\r\nexplained; and in my daring mood, I called on the Lord of the Dwarfie\r\nStone to aid me in attaining knowledge inaccessible to mere mortals.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the evil spirit heard your summons?\" said Minna, her blood curdling\r\nas she listened.\r\n\r\n\"Hush,\" said Norna, lowering her voice, \"vex him not with reproach--he\r\nis with us--he hears us even now.\"\r\n\r\nBrenda started from her seat.--\"I will to Euphane Fea's chamber,\" she\r\nsaid, \"and leave you, Minna and Norna, to finish your stories of\r\nhobgoblins and of dwarfs at your own leisure; I care not for them at any\r\ntime, but I will not endure them at midnight, and by this pale\r\nlamplight.\"\r\n\r\nShe was accordingly in the act of leaving the room, when her sister\r\ndetained her.\r\n\r\n\"Is this the courage,\" she said, \"of her, that disbelieves whatever the\r\nhistory of our fathers tells us of supernatural prodigy? What Norna has\r\nto tell concerns the fate, perhaps, of our father and his house;--if I\r\ncan listen to it, trusting that God and my innocence will protect me\r\nfrom all that is malignant, you, Brenda, who believe not in such\r\ninfluence, have surely no cause to tremble. Credit me, that for the\r\nguiltless there is no fear.\"\r\n\r\n\"There may be no danger,\" said Brenda, unable to suppress her natural\r\nturn for humour, \"but, as the old jest book says, there is much fear.\r\nHowever, Minna, I will stay with you;--the rather,\" she added, in a\r\nwhisper, \"that I am loath to leave you alone with this frightful woman,\r\nand that I have a dark staircase and long passage betwixt and Euphane\r\nFea, else I would have her here ere I were five minutes older.\"\r\n\r\n\"Call no one hither, maiden, upon peril of thy life,\" said Norna, \"and\r\ninterrupt not my tale again; for it cannot and must not be told after\r\nthat charmed light has ceased to burn.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I thank heaven,\" said Brenda to herself, \"that the oil burns low in\r\nthe cruize! I am sorely tempted to lend it a puff, but then Norna would\r\nbe alone with us in the dark, and that would be worse.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, she submitted to her fate, and sat down, determined to listen\r\nwith all the equanimity which she could command to the remaining part of\r\nNorna's tale, which went on as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"It happened on a hot summer day, and just about the hour of noon,\"\r\ncontinued Norna, \"as I sat by the Dwarfie Stone, with my eyes fixed on\r\nthe Ward-hill, whence the mysterious and ever-burning carbuncle shed its\r\nrays more brightly than usual, and repined in my heart at the restricted\r\nbounds of human knowledge, that at length I could not help exclaiming,\r\nin the words of an ancient Saga,\r\n\r\n  'Dwellers of the mountain, rise,\r\n  Trolld the powerful, Haims the wise!\r\n  Ye who taught weak woman's tongue\r\n  Words that sway the wise and strong,--\r\n  Ye who taught weak woman's hand\r\n  How to wield the magic wand,\r\n  And wake the gales on Foulah's steep,\r\n  Or lull wild Sumburgh's waves to sleep!--\r\n  Still are ye yet?--Not yours the power\r\n  Ye knew in Odin's mightier hour.\r\n  What are ye now but empty names,\r\n  Powerful Trolld, sagacious Haims,\r\n  That, lightly spoken, lightly heard,\r\n  Float on the air like thistle's beard?'\r\n\r\n\"I had scarce uttered these words,\" proceeded Norna, \"ere the sky, which\r\nhad been till then unusually clear, grew so suddenly dark around me,\r\nthat it seemed more like midnight than noon. A single flash of\r\nlightning showed me at once the desolate landscape of heath, morass,\r\nmountain, and precipice, which lay around; a single clap of thunder\r\nwakened all the echoes of the Ward-hill, which continued so long to\r\nrepeat the sound, that it seemed some rock, rent by the thunderbolt from\r\nthe summit, was rolling over cliff and precipice into the valley.\r\nImmediately after, fell a burst of rain so violent, that I was fain to\r\nshun its pelting, by creeping into the interior of the mysterious stone.\r\n\r\n\"I seated myself on the larger stone couch, which is cut at the farther\r\nend of the cavity, and, with my eyes fixed on the smaller bed, wearied\r\nmyself with conjectures respecting the origin and purpose of my singular\r\nplace of refuge. Had it been really the work of that powerful Trolld, to\r\nwhom the poetry of the Scalds referred it? Or was it the tomb of some\r\nScandinavian chief, interred with his arms and his wealth, perhaps also\r\nwith his immolated wife, that what he loved best in life might not in\r\ndeath be divided from him? Or was it the abode of penance, chosen by\r\nsome devoted anchorite of later days? Or the idle work of some wandering\r\nmechanic, whom chance, and whim, and leisure, had thrust upon such an\r\nundertaking? I tell you the thoughts that then floated through my brain,\r\nthat ye may know that what ensued was not the vision of a prejudiced or\r\nprepossessed imagination, but an apparition, as certain as it was awful.\r\n\r\n\"Sleep had gradually crept on me, amidst my lucubrations, when I was\r\nstartled from my slumbers by a second clap of thunder; and, when I\r\nawoke, I saw, through the dim light which the upper aperture admitted,\r\nthe unshapely and indistinct form of Trolld the dwarf, seated opposite\r\nto me on the lesser couch, which his square and misshapen bulk seemed\r\nabsolutely to fill up. I was startled, but not affrighted; for the blood\r\nof the ancient race of Lochlin was warm in my veins. He spoke; and his\r\nwords were of Norse, so old, that few, save my father, or I myself,\r\ncould have comprehended their import,--such language as was spoken in\r\nthese islands ere Olave planted the cross on the ruins of heathenism.\r\nHis meaning was dark also and obscure, like that which the Pagan priests\r\nwere wont to deliver, in the name of their idols, to the tribes that\r\nassembled at the _Helgafels_.[51] This was the import,--\r\n\r\n          'A thousand winters dark have flown,\r\n          Since o'er the threshold of my Stone\r\n          A votaress pass'd, my power to own.\r\n                Visitor bold\r\n                Of the mansion of Trolld,\r\n                    Maiden haughty of heart,\r\n                Who hast hither presumed,--\r\n                Ungifted, undoom'd,\r\n                    Thou shalt not depart;\r\n                The power thou dost covet\r\n                    O'er tempest and wave,\r\n                Shall be thine, thou proud maiden,\r\n                    By beach and by cave,--\r\n  By stack[52] and by skerry,[53] by noup[54] and by voe,[55]\r\n  By air[56] and by wick,[57] and by helyer[58] and gio,[59]\r\n  And by every wild shore which the northern winds know,\r\n          And the northern tides lave.\r\n  But though this shall be given thee, thou desperately brave,\r\n  I doom thee that never the gift thou shalt have,\r\n          Till thou reave thy life's giver\r\n          Of the gift which he gave.'\r\n\r\n\"I answered him in nearly the same strain; for the spirit of the ancient\r\nScalds of our race was upon me, and, far from fearing the phantom, with\r\nwhom I sat cooped within so narrow a space, I felt the impulse of that\r\nhigh courage which thrust the ancient Champions and Druidesses upon\r\ncontests with the invisible world, when they thought that the earth no\r\nlonger contained enemies worthy to be subdued by them. Therefore did I\r\nanswer him thus:--\r\n\r\n  'Dark are thy words, and severe,\r\n    Thou dweller in the stone;\r\n  But trembling and fear\r\n    To her are unknown,\r\n  Who hath sought thee here,\r\n    In thy dwelling lone.\r\n  Come what comes soever,\r\n    The worst I can endure;\r\n  Life is but a short fever,\r\n    And Death is the cure.'\r\n\r\n\"The Demon scowled at me, as if at once incensed and overawed; and then\r\ncoiling himself up in a thick and sulphureous vapour, he disappeared\r\nfrom his place. I did not, till that moment, feel the influence of\r\nfright, but then it seized me. I rushed into the open air, where the\r\ntempest had passed away, and all was pure and serene. After a moment's\r\nbreathless pause, I hasted home, musing by the way on the words of the\r\nphantom, which I could not, as often happens, recall so distinctly to\r\nmemory at the time, as I have been able to do since.\r\n\r\n\"It may seem strange that such an apparition should, in time, have\r\nglided from my mind, like a vision of the night--but so it was. I\r\nbrought myself to believe it the work of fancy--I thought I had lived\r\ntoo much in solitude, and had given way too much to the feelings\r\ninspired by my favourite studies. I abandoned them for a time, and I\r\nmixed with the youth of my age. I was upon a visit at Kirkwall when I\r\nlearned to know your father, whom business had brought thither. He\r\neasily found access to the relation with whom I lived, who was anxious\r\nto compose, if possible, the feud which divided our families. Your\r\nfather, maidens, has been rather hardened than changed by years--he had\r\nthe same manly form, the same old Norse frankness of manner and of\r\nheart, the same upright courage and honesty of disposition, with more of\r\nthe gentle ingenuousness of youth, an eager desire to please, a\r\nwillingness to be pleased, and a vivacity of spirits which survives not\r\nour early years. But though he was thus worthy of love, and though\r\nErland wrote to me, authorizing his attachment, there was another--a\r\nstranger, Minna, a fatal stranger--full of arts unknown to us, and\r\ngraces which to the plain manners of your father were unknown. Yes, he\r\nwalked, indeed, among us like a being of another and of a superior\r\nrace.--Ye look on me as if it were strange that I should have had\r\nattractions for such a lover; but I present nothing that can remind you\r\nthat Norna of the Fitful-head was once admired and loved as Ulla\r\nTroil--the change betwixt the animated body and the corpse after\r\ndisease, is scarce more awful and absolute than I have sustained, while\r\nI yet linger on earth. Look on me, maidens--look on me by this\r\nglimmering light--Can ye believe that these haggard and weather-wasted\r\nfeatures--these eyes, which have been almost converted to stone, by\r\nlooking upon sights of terror--these locks, that, mingled with grey, now\r\nstream out, the shattered pennons of a sinking vessel--that these, and\r\nshe to whom they belong, could once be the objects of fond\r\naffection?--But the waning lamp sinks fast, and let it sink while I tell\r\nmy infamy.--We loved in secret, we met in secret, till I gave the last\r\nproof of fatal and of guilty passion!--And now beam out, thou magic\r\nglimmer--shine out a little space, thou flame so powerful even in thy\r\nfeebleness--bid him who hovers near us, keep his dark pinions aloof from\r\nthe circle thou dost illuminate--live but a little till the worst be\r\ntold, and then sink when thou wilt into darkness, as black as my guilt\r\nand sorrow!\"\r\n\r\nWhile she spoke thus, she drew together the remaining nutriment of the\r\nlamp, and trimmed its decaying flame; then again, with a hollow voice,\r\nand in broken sentences, pursued her narrative.\r\n\r\n\"I must waste little time in words. My love was discovered, but not my\r\nguilt. Erland came to Pomona in anger, and transported me to our\r\nsolitary dwelling in Hoy. He commanded me to see my lover no more, and\r\nto receive Magnus, in whom he was willing to forgive the offences of his\r\nfather, as my future husband. Alas, I no longer deserved his\r\nattachment--my only wish was to escape from my father's dwelling, to\r\nconceal my shame in my lover's arms. Let me do him justice--he was\r\nfaithful--too, too faithful--his perfidy would have bereft me of my\r\nsenses; but the fatal consequences of his fidelity have done me a\r\ntenfold injury.\"\r\n\r\nShe paused, and then resumed, with the wild tone of insanity, \"It has\r\nmade me the powerful and the despairing Sovereign of the Seas and\r\nWinds!\"\r\n\r\nShe paused a second time after this wild exclamation, and resumed her\r\nnarrative in a more composed manner.\r\n\r\n\"My lover came in secret to Hoy, to concert measures for my flight, and\r\nI agreed to meet him, that we might fix the time when his vessel should\r\ncome into the Sound. I left the house at midnight.\"\r\n\r\nHere she appeared to gasp with agony, and went on with her tale by\r\nbroken and interrupted sentences. \"I left the house at midnight--I had\r\nto pass my father's door, and I perceived it was open--I thought he\r\nwatched us; and, that the sound of my steps might not break his\r\nslumbers, I closed the fatal door--a light and trivial action--but, God\r\nin Heaven! what were the consequences!--At morn, the room was full of\r\nsuffocating vapour--my father was dead--dead through my act--dead\r\nthrough my disobedience--dead through my infamy! All that follows is\r\nmist and darkness--a choking, suffocating, stifling mist envelopes all\r\nthat I said and did, all that was said and done, until I became assured\r\nthat my doom was accomplished, and walked forth the calm and terrible\r\nbeing you now behold me--the Queen of the Elements--the sharer in the\r\npower of those beings to whom man and his passions give such sport as\r\nthe tortures of the dog-fish afford the fisherman, when he pierces his\r\neyes with thorns, and turns him once more into his native element, to\r\ntraverse the waves in blindness and agony.[60] No, maidens, she whom you\r\nsee before you is impassive to the follies of which your minds are the\r\nsport. I am she that have made the offering--I am she that bereaved the\r\ngiver of the gift of life which he gave me--the dark saying has been\r\ninterpreted by my deed, and I am taken from humanity, to be something\r\npre-eminently powerful, pre-eminently wretched!\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke thus, the light, which had been long quivering, leaped high\r\nfor an instant, and seemed about to expire, when Norna, interrupting\r\nherself, said hastily, \"No more now--he comes--he comes--Enough that ye\r\nknow me, and the right I have to advise and command you.--Approach now,\r\nproud Spirit! if thou wilt.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, she extinguished the lamp, and passed out of the apartment\r\nwith her usual loftiness of step, as Minna could observe from its\r\nmeasured cadence.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[47] The Lawting was the Comitia, or Supreme Court, of the country,\r\nbeing retained both in Orkney and Zetland, and presenting, in its\r\nconstitution, the rude origin of a parliament.\r\n\r\n[48] And from which hill of Hoy, at midsummer, the sun may be seen, it\r\nis said, at midnight. So says the geographer Bleau, although, according\r\nto Dr. Wallace, it cannot be the true body of the sun which is visible,\r\nbut only its image refracted through some watery cloud upon the horizon.\r\n\r\n[49] Note VIII.--The Dwarfie Stone.\r\n\r\n[50] Note IX.--Carbuncle on the Ward-hill.\r\n\r\n[51] Or consecrated mountain, used by the Scandinavian priests for the\r\npurposes of their idol-worship.\r\n\r\n[52] _Stack._ A precipitous rock, rising out of the sea.\r\n\r\n[53] _Skerry._ A flat insulated rock, not subject to the overflowing of\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\n[54] _Noup._ A round-headed eminence.\r\n\r\n[55] _Voe._ A creek, or inlet of the sea.\r\n\r\n[56] _Air._ An open sea-beach.\r\n\r\n[57] _Wick._ An open bay.\r\n\r\n[58] _Helyer._ A cavern into which the tide flows.\r\n\r\n[59] _Gio._ A deep ravine which admits the sea.\r\n\r\n[60] This cruelty is practised by some fishers, out of a vindictive\r\nhatred to these ravenous fishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n  Is all the counsel that we two have shared--\r\n  The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,\r\n  When we have chid the hasty-footed time\r\n  For parting us--O, and is all forgot?\r\n\r\n                                  _Midsummer-Night's Dream._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe attention of Minna was powerfully arrested by this tale of terror,\r\nwhich accorded with and explained many broken hints respecting Norna,\r\nwhich she had heard from her father and other near relations, and she\r\nwas for a time so lost in surprise, not unmingled with horror, that she\r\ndid not even attempt to speak to her sister Brenda. When, at length, she\r\ncalled her by her name, she received no answer, and, on touching her\r\nhand, she found it cold as ice. Alarmed to the uttermost, she threw open\r\nthe lattice and the window-shutters, and admitted at once the free air\r\nand the pale glimmer of the hyperborean summer night. She then became\r\nsensible that her sister was in a swoon. All thoughts concerning Norna,\r\nher frightful tale, and her mysterious connexion with the invisible\r\nworld, at once vanished from Minna's thoughts, and she hastily ran to\r\nthe apartment of the old housekeeper, to summon her aid, without\r\nreflecting for a moment what sights she might encounter in the long dark\r\npassages which she had to traverse.\r\n\r\nThe old woman hastened to Brenda's assistance, and instantly applied\r\nsuch remedies as her experience suggested; but the poor girl's nervous\r\nsystem had been so much agitated by the horrible tale she had just\r\nheard, that, when recovered from her swoon, her utmost endeavours to\r\ncompose her mind could not prevent her falling into a hysterical fit of\r\nsome duration. This also was subdued by the experience of old Euphane\r\nFea, who was well versed in all the simple pharmacy used by the natives\r\nof Zetland, and who, after administering a composing draught, distilled\r\nfrom simples and wild flowers, at length saw her patient resigned to\r\nsleep. Minna stretched herself beside her sister, kissed her cheek, and\r\ncourted slumber in her turn; but the more she invoked it, the farther it\r\nseemed to fly from her eyelids; and if at times she was disposed to sink\r\ninto repose, the voice of the involuntary parricide seemed again to\r\nsound in her ears, and startled her into consciousness.\r\n\r\nThe early morning hour at which they were accustomed to rise, found the\r\nstate of the sisters different from what might have been expected. A\r\nsound sleep had restored the spirit of Brenda's lightsome eye, and the\r\nrose on her laughing cheek; the transient indisposition of the preceding\r\nnight having left as little trouble on her look, as the fantastic\r\nterrors of Norna's tale had been able to impress on her imagination. The\r\nlooks of Minna, on the contrary, were melancholy, downcast, and\r\napparently exhausted by watching and anxiety. They said at first little\r\nto each other, as if afraid of touching a subject so fraught with\r\nemotion as the scene of the preceding night. It was not until they had\r\nperformed together their devotions, as usual, that Brenda, while lacing\r\nMinna's boddice, (for they rendered the services of the toilet to each\r\nother reciprocally,) became aware of the paleness of her sister's\r\nlooks; and having ascertained, by a glance at the mirror, that her own\r\ndid not wear the same dejection, she kissed Minna's cheek, and said\r\naffectionately, \"Claud Halcro was right, my dearest sister, when his\r\npoetical folly gave us these names of Night and Day.\"\r\n\r\n\"And wherefore should you say so now?\" said Minna.\r\n\r\n\"Because we each are bravest in the season that we take our name from: I\r\nwas frightened wellnigh to death, by hearing those things last night,\r\nwhich you endured with courageous firmness; and now, when it is broad\r\nlight, I can think of them with composure, while you look as pale as a\r\nspirit who is surprised by sunrise.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are lucky, Brenda,\" said her sister, gravely, \"who can so soon\r\nforget such a tale of wonder and horror.\"\r\n\r\n\"The horror,\" said Brenda, \"is never to be forgotten, unless one could\r\nhope that the unfortunate woman's excited imagination, which shows\r\nitself so active in conjuring up apparitions, may have fixed on her an\r\nimaginary crime.\"\r\n\r\n\"You believe nothing, then,\" said Minna, \"of her interview at the\r\nDwarfie Stone, that wondrous place, of which so many tales are told, and\r\nwhich, for so many centuries, has been reverenced as the work of a\r\ndemon, and as his abode?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe,\" said Brenda, \"that our unhappy relative is no\r\nimpostor,--and therefore I believe that she was at the Dwarfie Stone\r\nduring a thunderstorm, that she sought shelter in it, and that, during a\r\nswoon, or during sleep perhaps, some dream visited her, concerned with\r\nthe popular traditions with which she was so conversant; but I cannot\r\neasily believe more.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet the event,\" said Minna, \"corresponded to the dark intimations\r\nof the vision.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me,\" said Brenda, \"I rather think the dream would never have\r\nbeen put into shape, or perhaps remembered at all, but for the event.\r\nShe told us herself she had nearly forgot the vision, till after her\r\nfather's dreadful death,--and who shall warrant how much of what she\r\nthen supposed herself to remember was not the creation of her own fancy,\r\ndisordered as it naturally was by the horrid accident? Had she really\r\nseen and conversed with a necromantic dwarf, she was likely to remember\r\nthe conversation long enough--at least I am sure I should.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brenda,\" replied Minna, \"you have heard the good minister of the\r\nCross-Kirk say, that human wisdom was worse than folly, when it was\r\napplied to mysteries beyond its comprehension; and that, if we believed\r\nno more than we could understand, we should resist the evidence of our\r\nsenses, which presented us, at every turn, circumstances as certain as\r\nthey were unintelligible.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are too learned yourself, sister,\" answered Brenda, \"to need the\r\nassistance of the good minister of Cross-Kirk; but I think his doctrine\r\nonly related to the mysteries of our religion, which it is our duty to\r\nreceive without investigation or doubt--but in things occurring in\r\ncommon life, as God has bestowed reason upon us, we cannot act wrong in\r\nemploying it. But you, my dear Minna, have a warmer fancy than mine, and\r\nare willing to receive all those wonderful stories for truth, because\r\nyou love to think of sorcerers, and dwarfs, and water-spirits, and\r\nwould like much to have a little trow, or fairy, as the Scotch call\r\nthem, with a green coat, and a pair of wings as brilliant as the hues of\r\nthe starling's neck, specially to attend on you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would spare you at least the trouble of lacing my boddice,\" said\r\nMinna, \"and of lacing it wrong, too; for in the heat of your argument\r\nyou have missed two eyelet-holes.\"\r\n\r\n\"That error shall be presently mended,\" said Brenda; \"and then, as one\r\nof our friends might say, I will haul tight and belay--but you draw your\r\nbreath so deeply, that it will be a difficult matter.\"\r\n\r\n\"I only sighed,\" said Minna, in some confusion, \"to think how soon you\r\ncan trifle with and ridicule the misfortunes of this extraordinary\r\nwoman.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not ridicule them, God knows!\" replied Brenda, somewhat angrily;\r\n\"it is you, Minna, who turn all I say in truth and kindness, to\r\nsomething harsh or wicked. I look on Norna as a woman of very\r\nextraordinary abilities, which are very often united with a strong cast\r\nof insanity; and I consider her as better skilled in the signs of the\r\nweather than any woman in Zetland. But that she has any power over the\r\nelements, I no more believe, than I do in the nursery stories of King\r\nErick, who could make the wind blow from the point he set his cap to.\"\r\n\r\nMinna, somewhat nettled with the obstinate incredulity of her sister,\r\nreplied sharply, \"And yet, Brenda, this woman--half-mad woman, and the\r\nveriest impostor--is the person by whom you choose to be advised in the\r\nmatter next your own heart at this moment!\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know what you mean,\" said Brenda, colouring deeply, and\r\nshifting to get away from her sister. But as she was now undergoing the\r\nceremony of being laced in her turn, her sister had the means of holding\r\nher fast by the silken string with which she was fastening the boddice,\r\nand, tapping her on the neck, which expressed, by its sudden writhe, and\r\nsudden change to a scarlet hue, as much pettish confusion as she had\r\ndesired to provoke, she added, more mildly, \"Is it not strange, Brenda,\r\nthat, used as we have been by the stranger Mordaunt Mertoun, whose\r\nassurance has brought him uninvited to a house where his presence is so\r\nunacceptable, you should still look or think of him with favour? Surely,\r\nthat you do so should be a proof to you, that there are such things as\r\nspells in the country, and that you yourself labour under them. It is\r\nnot for nought that Mordaunt wears a chain of elfin gold--look to it,\r\nBrenda, and be wise in time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have nothing to do with Mordaunt Mertoun,\" answered Brenda, hastily,\r\n\"nor do I know or care what he or any other young man wears about his\r\nneck. I could see all the gold chains of all the bailies of Edinburgh,\r\nthat Lady Glowrowrum speaks so much of, without falling in fancy with\r\none of the wearers.\" And, having thus complied with the female rule of\r\npleading not guilty in general to such an indictment, she immediately\r\nresumed, in a different tone, \"But, to say the truth, Minna, I think\r\nyou, and all of you, have judged far too hastily about this young friend\r\nof ours, who has been so long our most intimate companion. Mind,\r\nMordaunt Mertoun is no more to me than he is to you--who best know how\r\nlittle difference he made betwixt us; and that, chain or no chain, he\r\nlived with us like a brother with two sisters; and yet you can turn him\r\noff at once, because a wandering seaman, of whom we know nothing, and a\r\npeddling jagger, whom we do know to be a thief, a cheat, and a liar,\r\nspeak words and carry tales in his disfavour! I do not believe he ever\r\nsaid he could have his choice of either of us, and only waited to see\r\nwhich was to have Burgh-Westra and Bredness Voe--I do not believe he\r\never spoke such a word, or harboured such a thought, as that of making a\r\nchoice between us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" said Minna, coldly, \"you may have had reason to know that his\r\nchoice was already determined.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not endure this!\" said Brenda, giving way to her natural\r\nvivacity, and springing from between her sister's hands; then turning\r\nround and facing her, while her glowing cheek was rivalled in the\r\ndeepness of its crimson, by as much of her neck and bosom as the upper\r\npart of the half-laced boddice permitted to be visible,--\"Even from you,\r\nMinna,\" she said, \"I will not endure this! You know that all my life I\r\nhave spoken the truth, and that I love the truth; and I tell you, that\r\nMordaunt Mertoun never in his life made distinction betwixt you and me,\r\nuntil\"----\r\n\r\nHere some feeling of consciousness stopped her short, and her sister\r\nreplied, with a smile, \"Until _when_, Brenda? Methinks, your love of\r\ntruth seems choked with the sentence you were bringing out.\"\r\n\r\n\"Until you ceased to do him the justice he deserves,\" said Brenda,\r\nfirmly, \"since I must speak out. I have little doubt that he will not\r\nlong throw away his friendship on you, who hold it so lightly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be it so,\" said Minna; \"you are secure from my rivalry, either in his\r\nfriendship or love. But bethink you better, Brenda--this is no scandal\r\nof Cleveland's--Cleveland is incapable of slander--no falsehood of Bryce\r\nSnailsfoot--not one of our friends or acquaintance but says it has been\r\nthe common talk of the island, that the daughters of Magnus Troil were\r\npatiently awaiting the choice of the nameless and birthless stranger,\r\nMordaunt Mertoun. Is it fitting that this should be said of us, the\r\ndescendants of a Norwegian Jarl, and the daughters of the first Udaller\r\nin Zetland? or, would it be modest or maidenly to submit to it\r\nunresented, were we the meanest lasses that ever lifted a milk-pail?\"\r\n\r\n\"The tongues of fools are no reproach,\" replied Brenda, warmly; \"I will\r\nnever quit my own thoughts of an innocent friend for the gossip of the\r\nisland, which can put the worst meaning on the most innocent actions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear but what our friends say,\" repeated Minna; \"hear but the Lady\r\nGlowrowrum; hear but Maddie and Clara Groatsettar.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I were to hear Lady Glowrowrum,\" said Brenda, steadily, \"I should\r\nlisten to the worst tongue in Zetland; and as for Maddie and Clara\r\nGroatsettar, they were both blithe enough to get Mordaunt to sit betwixt\r\nthem at dinner the day before yesterday, as you might have observed\r\nyourself, but that your ear was better engaged.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your eyes, at least, have been but indifferently engaged, Brenda,\"\r\nretorted the elder sister, \"since they were fixed on a young man, whom\r\nall the world but yourself believes to have talked of us with the most\r\ninsolent presumption; and even if he be innocently charged, Lady\r\nGlowrowrum says it is unmaidenly and bold of you even to look in the\r\ndirection where he sits, knowing it must confirm such reports.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will look which way I please,\" said Brenda, growing still warmer;\r\n\"Lady Glowrowrum shall neither rule my thoughts, nor my words, nor my\r\neyes. I hold Mordaunt Mertoun to be innocent,--I will look at him as\r\nsuch,--I will speak of him as such; and if I did not speak to him also,\r\nand behave to him as usual, it is in obedience to my father, and not for\r\nwhat Lady Glowrowrum, and all her nieces, had she twenty instead of two,\r\ncould think, wink, nod, or tattle, about the matter that concerns them\r\nnot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! Brenda,\" answered Minna, with calmness, \"this vivacity is more\r\nthan is required for the defence of the character of a mere\r\nfriend!--Beware--He who ruined Norna's peace for ever, was a stranger,\r\nadmitted to her affections against the will of her family.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was a stranger,\" replied Brenda, with emphasis, \"not only in birth,\r\nbut in manners. She had not been bred up with him from her youth,--she\r\nhad not known the gentleness, the frankness, of his disposition, by an\r\nintimacy of many years. He was indeed a stranger, in character, temper,\r\nbirth, manners, and morals,--some wandering adventurer, perhaps, whom\r\nchance or tempest had thrown upon the islands, and who knew how to mask\r\na false heart with a frank brow. My good sister, take home your own\r\nwarning. There are other strangers at Burgh-Westra besides this poor\r\nMordaunt Mertoun.\"\r\n\r\nMinna seemed for a moment overwhelmed with the rapidity with which her\r\nsister retorted her suspicion and her caution. But her natural\r\nloftiness of disposition enabled her to reply with assumed composure.\r\n\r\n\"Were I to treat you, Brenda, with the want of confidence you show\r\ntowards me, I might reply that Cleveland is no more to me than Mordaunt\r\nwas; or than young Swartaster, or Lawrence Ericson, or any other\r\nfavourite guest of my father's, now is. But I scorn to deceive you, or\r\nto disguise my thoughts.--I love Clement Cleveland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not say so, my dearest sister,\" said Brenda, abandoning at once the\r\nair of acrimony with which the conversation had been latterly conducted,\r\nand throwing her arms round her sister's neck, with looks, and with a\r\ntone, of the most earnest affection,--\"do not say so, I implore you! I\r\nwill renounce Mordaunt Mertoun,--I will swear never to speak to him\r\nagain; but do not repeat that you love this Cleveland!\"\r\n\r\n\"And why should I not repeat,\" said Minna, disengaging herself gently\r\nfrom her sister's grasp, \"a sentiment in which I glory? The boldness,\r\nthe strength and energy, of his character, to which command is natural,\r\nand fear unknown,--these very properties, which alarm you for my\r\nhappiness, are the qualities which ensure it. Remember, Brenda, that\r\nwhen your foot loved the calm smooth sea-beach of the summer sea, mine\r\never delighted in the summit of the precipice, when the waves are in\r\nfury.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it is even that which I dread,\" said Brenda; \"it is even that\r\nadventurous disposition which now is urging you to the brink of a\r\nprecipice more dangerous than ever was washed by a spring-tide. This\r\nman,--do not frown, I will say no slander of him,--but is he not, even\r\nin your own partial judgment, stern and overbearing? accustomed, as you\r\nsay, to command; but, for that very reason, commanding where he has no\r\nright to do so, and leading whom it would most become him to follow?\r\nrushing on danger, rather for its own sake, than for any other object?\r\nAnd can you think of being yoked with a spirit so unsettled and stormy,\r\nwhose life has hitherto been led in scenes of death and peril, and who,\r\neven while sitting by your side, cannot disguise his impatience again to\r\nengage in them? A lover, methinks, should love his mistress better than\r\nhis own life; but yours, my dear Minna, loves her less than the pleasure\r\nof inflicting death on others.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it is even for that I love him,\" said Minna. \"I am a daughter of\r\nthe old dames of Norway, who could send their lovers to battle with a\r\nsmile, and slay them, with their own hands, if they returned with\r\ndishonour. My lover must scorn the mockeries by which our degraded race\r\nstrive for distinction, or must practise them only in sport, and in\r\nearnest of nobler dangers. No whale-striking, bird-nesting favourite for\r\nme; my lover must be a Sea-king, or what else modern times may give that\r\ndraws near to that lofty character.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas, my sister!\" said Brenda, \"it is now that I must in earnest begin\r\nto believe the force of spells and of charms. You remember the Spanish\r\nstory which you took from me long since, because I said, in your\r\nadmiration of the chivalry of the olden times of Scandinavia, you\r\nrivalled the extravagance of the hero.--Ah, Minna, your colour shows\r\nthat your conscience checks you, and reminds you of the book I mean;--is\r\nit more wise, think you, to mistake a windmill for a giant, or the\r\ncommander of a paltry corsair for a Kiempe, or a Vi-king?\"\r\n\r\nMinna did indeed colour with anger at this insinuation, of which,\r\nperhaps, she felt in some degree the truth.\r\n\r\n\"You have a right,\" she said, \"to insult me, because you are possessed\r\nof my secret.\"\r\n\r\nBrenda's soft heart could not resist this charge of unkindness; she\r\nadjured her sister to pardon her, and the natural gentleness of Minna's\r\nfeelings could not resist her entreaties.\r\n\r\n\"We are unhappy,\" she said, as she dried her sister's tears, \"that we\r\ncannot see with the same eyes--let us not make each other more so by\r\nmutual insult and unkindness. You have my secret--it will not, perhaps,\r\nlong be one, for my father shall have the confidence to which he is\r\nentitled, so soon as certain circumstances will permit me to offer it.\r\nMeantime, I repeat, you have my secret, and I more than suspect that I\r\nhave yours in exchange, though you refuse to own it.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, Minna!\" said Brenda; \"would you have me acknowledge for any one\r\nsuch feelings as you allude to, ere he has said the least word that\r\ncould justify such a confession?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely not; but a hidden fire may be distinguished by heat as well as\r\nflame.\"\r\n\r\n\"You understand these signs, Minna,\" said Brenda, hanging down her head,\r\nand in vain endeavouring to suppress the temptation to repartee which\r\nher sister's remark offered; \"but I can only say, that, if ever I love\r\nat all, it shall not be until I have been asked to do so once or twice\r\nat least, which has not yet chanced to me. But do not let us renew our\r\nquarrel, and rather let us think why Norna should have told us that\r\nhorrible tale, and to what she expects it should lead.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must have been as a caution,\" replied Minna--\"a caution which our\r\nsituation, and, I will not deny it, which mine in particular, might seem\r\nto her to call for;--but I am alike strong in my own innocence, and in\r\nthe honour of Cleveland.\"\r\n\r\nBrenda would fain have replied, that she did not confide so absolutely\r\nin the latter security as in the first; but she was prudent, and,\r\nforbearing to awaken the former painful discussion, only replied, \"It is\r\nstrange that Norna should have said nothing more of her lover. Surely he\r\ncould not desert her in the extremity of misery to which he had reduced\r\nher?\"\r\n\r\n\"There may be agonies of distress,\" said Minna, after a pause, \"in which\r\nthe mind is so much jarred, that it ceases to be responsive even to the\r\nfeelings which have most engrossed it;--her sorrow for her lover may\r\nhave been swallowed up in horror and despair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or he might have fled from the islands, in fear of our father's\r\nvengeance,\" replied Brenda.\r\n\r\n\"If for fear, or faintness of heart,\" said Minna, looking upwards, \"he\r\nwas capable of flying from the ruin which he had occasioned, I trust he\r\nhas long ere this sustained the punishment which Heaven reserves for the\r\nmost base and dastardly of traitors and of cowards.--Come, sister, we\r\nare ere this expected at the breakfast board.\"\r\n\r\nAnd they went thither, arm in arm, with much more of confidence than had\r\nlately subsisted between them; the little quarrel which had taken place\r\nhaving served the purpose of a _bourasque_, or sudden squall, which\r\ndispels mists and vapours, and leaves fair weather behind it.\r\n\r\nOn their way to the breakfast apartment, they agreed that it was\r\nunnecessary, and might be imprudent, to communicate to their father the\r\ncircumstance of the nocturnal visit, or to let him observe that they now\r\nknew more than formerly of the melancholy history of Norna.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR'S NOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote I., p. 22.--NORSE FRAGMENTS.\r\n\r\nNear the conclusion of Chapter II, it is noticed that the old Norwegian\r\nsagas were preserved and often repeated by the fishermen of Orkney and\r\nZetland, while that language was not yet quite forgotten. Mr. Baikie of\r\nTankerness, a most respectable inhabitant of Kirkwall, and an Orkney\r\nproprietor, assured me of the following curious fact.\r\n\r\nA clergyman, who was not long deceased, remembered well when some\r\nremnants of the Norse were still spoken in the island called North\r\nRonaldshaw. When Gray's Ode, entitled the \"Fatal Sisters,\" was first\r\npublished, or at least first reached that remote island, the reverend\r\ngentleman had the well-judged curiosity to read it to some of the old\r\npersons of the isle, as a poem which regarded the history of their own\r\ncountry. They listened with great attention to the preliminary\r\nstanzas:--\r\n\r\n  \"Now the storm begins to lour,\r\n    Haste the loom of hell prepare,\r\n  Iron sleet of arrowry shower\r\n    Hurtles in the darken'd air.\"\r\n\r\nBut when they had heard a verse or two more, they interrupted the\r\nreader, telling him they knew the song well in the Norse language, and\r\nhad often sung it to him when he asked them for an old song. They called\r\nit the Magicians, or the Enchantresses. It would have been singular news\r\nto the elegant translator, when executing his version from the text of\r\nBartholine, to have learned that the Norse original was still preserved\r\nby tradition in a remote corner of the British dominions. The\r\ncircumstances will probably justify what is said in the text concerning\r\nthe traditions of the inhabitants of those remote isles, at the\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nEven yet, though the Norse language is entirely disused, except in so\r\nfar as particular words and phrases are still retained, these fishers of\r\nthe Ultima Thule are a generation much attached to these ancient\r\nlegends. Of this the author learned a singular instance.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty years ago, a missionary clergyman had taken the resolution\r\nof traversing those wild islands, where he supposed there might be a\r\nlack of religious instruction, which he believed himself capable of\r\nsupplying. After being some days at sea in an open boat, he arrived at\r\nNorth Ronaldshaw, where his appearance excited great speculation. He was\r\na very little man, dark-complexioned, and from the fatigue he had\r\nsustained in removing from one island to another, appeared before them\r\nill-dressed and unshaved; so that the inhabitants set him down as one of\r\nthe Ancient Picts, or, as they call them with the usual strong guttural,\r\nPeghts. How they might have received the poor preacher in this\r\ncharacter, was at least dubious; and the schoolmaster of the parish, who\r\nhad given quarters to the fatigued traveller, set off to consult with\r\nMr. S----, the able and ingenious engineer of the Scottish Light-House\r\nService, who chanced to be on the island. As his skill and knowledge\r\nwere in the highest repute, it was conceived that Mr. S---- could decide\r\nat once whether the stranger was a Peght, or ought to be treated as\r\nsuch. Mr. S---- was so good-natured as to attend the summons, with the\r\nview of rendering the preacher some service. The poor missionary, who\r\nhad watched for three nights, was now fast asleep, little dreaming what\r\nodious suspicions were current respecting him. The inhabitants were\r\nassembled round the door. Mr. S----, understanding the traveller's\r\ncondition, declined disturbing him, upon which the islanders produced a\r\npair of very little uncouth-looking boots, with prodigiously thick\r\nsoles, and appealed to him whether it was possible such articles of\r\nraiment could belong to any one but a Peght. Mr. S----, finding the\r\nprejudices of the natives so strong, was induced to enter the sleeping\r\napartment of the traveller, and was surprised to recognise in the\r\nsupposed Peght a person whom he had known in his worldly profession of\r\nan Edinburgh shopkeeper, before he had assumed his present vocation. Of\r\ncourse he was enabled to refute all suspicions of Peghtism.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote II., p. 23.--MONSTERS OF THE NORTHERN SEAS.\r\n\r\nI have said, in the text, that the wondrous tales told by Pontoppidan,\r\nthe Archbishop of Upsal, still find believers in the Northern\r\nArchipelago. It is in vain they are cancelled even in the later editions\r\nof Guthrie's Grammar, of which instructive work they used to form the\r\nchapter far most attractive to juvenile readers. But the same causes\r\nwhich probably gave birth to the legends concerning mermaids,\r\nsea-snakes, krakens, and other marvellous inhabitants of the Northern\r\nOcean, are still afloat in those climates where they took their rise.\r\nThey had their origin probably from the eagerness of curiosity\r\nmanifested by our elegant poetess, Mrs. Hemans:\r\n\r\n  \"What hidest thou in thy treasure-caves and cells,\r\n  Thou ever-sounding and mysterious Sea?\"\r\n\r\nThe additional mystic gloom which rests on these northern billows for\r\nhalf the year, joined to the imperfect glance obtained of occasional\r\nobjects, encourage the timid or the fanciful to give way to imagination,\r\nand frequently to shape out a distinct story from some object half seen\r\nand imperfectly examined. Thus, some years since, a large object was\r\nobserved in the beautiful Bay of Scalloway in Zetland, so much in vulgar\r\nopinion resembling the kraken, that though it might be distinguished for\r\nseveral days, if the exchange of darkness to twilight can be termed so,\r\nyet the hardy boatmen shuddered to approach it, for fear of being drawn\r\ndown by the suction supposed to attend its sinking. It was probably the\r\nhull of some vessel which had foundered at sea.\r\n\r\nThe belief in mermaids, so fanciful and pleasing in itself, is ever and\r\nanon refreshed by a strange tale from the remote shores of some solitary\r\nislet.\r\n\r\nThe author heard a mariner of some reputation in his class vouch for\r\nhaving seen the celebrated sea-serpent. It appeared, so far as could be\r\nguessed, to be about a hundred feet long, with the wild mane and fiery\r\neyes which old writers ascribe to the monster; but it is not unlikely\r\nthe spectator might, in the doubtful light, be deceived by the\r\nappearance of a good Norway log floating on the waves. I have only to\r\nadd, that the remains of an animal, supposed to belong to this latter\r\nspecies, were driven on shore in the Zetland Isles, within the\r\nrecollection of man. Part of the bones were sent to London, and\r\npronounced by Sir Joseph Banks to be those of a basking shark; yet it\r\nwould seem that an animal so well known, ought to have been immediately\r\ndistinguished by the northern fishermen.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote III., p. 104.--SALE OF WINDS.\r\n\r\nThe King of Sweden, the same Eric quoted by Mordaunt, \"was,\" says Olaus\r\nMagnus, \"in his time held second to none in the magical art; and he was\r\nso familiar with the evil spirits whom he worshipped, that what way\r\nsoever he turned his cap, the wind would presently blow that way. For\r\nthis he was called Windycap.\" _Historia de Gentibus Septentrionalibus.\r\nRomæ, 1555._ It is well known that the Laplanders derive a profitable\r\ntrade in selling _winds_, but it is perhaps less notorious, that within\r\nthese few years such a commodity might be purchased on British ground,\r\nwhere it was likely to be in great request. At the village of Stromness,\r\non the Orkney main island, called Pomona, lived, in 1814, an aged dame,\r\ncalled Bessie Millie, who helped out her subsistence by selling\r\nfavourable winds to mariners. He was a venturous master of a vessel who\r\nleft the roadstead of Stromness without paying his offering to\r\npropitiate Bessie Millie; her fee was extremely moderate, being exactly\r\nsixpence, for which, as she explained herself, she boiled her kettle and\r\ngave the bark advantage of her prayers, for she disclaimed all unlawful\r\narts. The wind thus petitioned for was sure, she said, to arrive, though\r\noccasionally the mariners had to wait some time for it. The woman's\r\ndwelling and appearance were not unbecoming her pretensions; her house,\r\nwhich was on the brow of the steep hill on which Stromness is founded,\r\nwas only accessible by a series of dirty and precipitous lanes, and for\r\nexposure might have been the abode of Eolus himself, in whose\r\ncommodities the inhabitant dealt. She herself was, as she told us,\r\nnearly one hundred years old, withered and dried up like a mummy. A\r\nclay-coloured kerchief, folded round her head, corresponded in colour to\r\nher corpse-like complexion. Two light-blue eyes that gleamed with a\r\nlustre like that of insanity, an utterance of astonishing rapidity, a\r\nnose and chin that almost met together, and a ghastly expression of\r\ncunning, gave her the effect of Hecaté. She remembered Gow the pirate,\r\nwho had been a native of these islands, in which he closed his career,\r\nas mentioned in the preface. Such was Bessie Millie, to whom the\r\nmariners paid a sort of tribute, with a feeling betwixt jest and\r\nearnest.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote IV., p. 113.--RELUCTANCE TO SAVE A DROWNING MAN.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable, that in an archipelago where so many persons must be\r\nnecessarily endangered by the waves, so strange and inhuman a maxim\r\nshould have ingrafted itself upon the minds of a people otherwise kind,\r\nmoral, and hospitable. But all with whom I have spoken agree, that it\r\nwas almost general in the beginning of the eighteenth century, and was\r\nwith difficulty weeded out by the sedulous instructions of the clergy,\r\nand the rigorous injunctions of the proprietors. There is little doubt\r\nit had been originally introduced as an excuse for suffering those who\r\nattempted to escape from the wreck to perish unassisted, so that, there\r\nbeing no survivor, she might be considered as lawful plunder. A story\r\nwas told me, I hope an untrue one, that a vessel having got ashore among\r\nthe breakers on one of the remote Zetland islands, five or six men, the\r\nwhole or greater part of the unfortunate crew, endeavoured to land by\r\nassistance of a hawser, which they had secured to a rock; the\r\ninhabitants were assembled, and looked on with some uncertainty, till an\r\nold man said, \"Sirs, if these men come ashore, the additional mouths\r\nwill eat all the meal we have in store for winter; and how are we to get\r\nmore?\" A young fellow, moved with this argument, struck the rope asunder\r\nwith his axe, and all the poor wretches were immersed among the\r\nbreakers, and perished.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote V., p. 121.--MAIR WRECKS ERE WINTER.\r\n\r\nThe ancient Zetlander looked upon the sea as the provider of his living,\r\nnot only by the plenty produced by the fishings, but by the spoil of\r\nwrecks. Some particular islands have fallen off very considerably in\r\ntheir rent, since the commissioners of the lighthouses have ordered\r\nlights on the Isle of Sanda and the Pentland Skerries. A gentleman,\r\nfamiliar with those seas, expressed surprise at seeing the farmer of one\r\nof the isles in a boat with a very old pair of sails. \"Had it been His\r\nwill\"--said the man, with an affected deference to Providence, very\r\ninconsistent with the sentiment of his speech--\"Had it been _His_ will\r\nthat light had not been placed yonder, I would have had enough of new\r\nsails last winter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNote VI., p. 172.--ZETLAND CORN-MILLS.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly something very extraordinary to a stranger in Zetland\r\ncorn-mills. They are of the smallest possible size; the wheel which\r\ndrives them is horizontal, and the cogs are turned diagonally to the\r\nwater. The beam itself stands upright, and is inserted in a stone quern\r\nof the old-fashioned construction, which it turns round, and thus\r\nperforms its duty. Had Robinson Crusoe ever been in Zetland, he would\r\nhave had no difficulty in contriving a machine for grinding corn in his\r\ndesert island. These mills are thatched over in a little hovel, which\r\nhas much the air of a pig-sty. There may be five hundred such mills on\r\none island, not capable any one of them of grinding above a sackful of\r\ncorn at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote VII., p. 234.--THE SWORD-DANCE.\r\n\r\nThe Sword-Dance is celebrated in general terms by Olaus Magnus. He seems\r\nto have considered it as peculiar to the Norwegians, from whom it may\r\nhave passed to the Orkneymen and Zetlanders, with other northern\r\ncustoms.\r\n\r\n\"OF THEIR DANCING IN ARMS.\r\n\r\n\"Moreover, the northern Goths and Swedes had another sport to exercise\r\nyouth withall, that they will dance and skip amongst naked swords and\r\ndangerous weapons. And this they do after the manner of masters of\r\ndefence, as they are taught from their youth by skilful teachers, that\r\ndance before them, and sing to it. And this play is showed especially\r\nabout Shrovetide, called in Italian _Macchararum_. For, before\r\ncarnivals, all the youth dance for eight days together, holding their\r\nswords up, but within the scabbards, for three times turning about; and\r\nthen they do it with their naked swords lifted up. After this, turning\r\nmore moderately, taking the points and pummels one of the other, they\r\nchange ranks, and place themselves in an triagonal figure, and this they\r\ncall _Rosam_; and presently they dissolve it by drawing back their\r\nswords and lifting them up, that upon every one's head there may be made\r\na square Rosa, and then by a most nimbly whisking their swords about\r\ncollaterally, they quickly leap back, and end the sport, which they\r\nguide with pipes or songs, or both together; first by a more heavy, then\r\nby a more vehement, and lastly, by a most vehement dancing. But this\r\nspeculation is scarce to be understood but by those who look on, how\r\ncomely and decent it is, when at one word, or one commanding, the whole\r\narmed multitude is directed to fall to fight, and clergymen may exercise\r\nthemselves, and mingle themselves amongst others at this sport, because\r\nit is all guided by most wise reason.\"\r\n\r\nTo the Primate's account of the sword-dance, I am able to add the words\r\nsung or chanted, on occasion of this dance, as it is still performed in\r\nPapa Stour, a remote island of Zetland, where alone the custom keeps its\r\nground. It is, it will be observed by antiquaries, a species of play or\r\nmystery, in which the Seven Champions of Christendom make their\r\nappearance, as in the interlude presented in \"All's Well that Ends\r\nWell.\" This dramatic curiosity was most kindly procured for my use by\r\nDr. Scott of Hazlar Hospital, son of my friend Mr. Scott of Mewbie,\r\nZetland. Mr. Hibbert has, in his Description of the Zetland Islands,\r\ngiven an account of the sword-dance, but somewhat less full than the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\"WORDS USED AS A PRELUDE TO THE SWORD-DANCE, A DANISH OR NORWEGIAN\r\nBALLET, COMPOSED SOME CENTURIES AGO, AND PRESERVED IN PAPA STOUR,\r\nZETLAND.\r\n\r\nPERSONÆ DRAMATIS.[61]\r\n\r\n(_Enter_ MASTER, _in the character of_ ST.

Present thyself here in our sight,\r\n  Thou brave French knight,\r\n  Who bold hast been;\r\n  Since thou such valiant acts hast done,\r\n  Come let us see some of them now\r\n  With courtesy, thou brave French knight,\r\n  Draw out thy sword of noble hue.\r\n\r\n(DENNIS _dances, while the others retire to a side_.)\r\n\r\n  Brave David a bow must string, and with awe\r\n  Set up a wand upon a stand,\r\n  And that brave David will cleave in twa.[66]\r\n  (DAVID _dances solus._)\r\n  Here is, I think, an Irish knight,\r\n  Who does not fear, or does not fright,\r\n  To prove thyself a valiant man,\r\n  As thou hast done full often bright;\r\n  Brave Patrick, dance, if that thou can.\r\n\r\n(_He dances._)\r\n\r\n  Thou stout Italian, come thou here;\r\n  Thy name is Anthony, most

Fight for thy king with thy right hand;\r\n  And aye as long as thou canst stand,\r\n  Fight for thy king with all thy heart;\r\n  And then, for to confirm his band,\r\n  Make all his enemies for to smart.--(_He dances._)\r\n\r\n(_Music begins._)\r\n\r\nFIGUIR.[68]\r\n\r\n\"The six stand in rank with their swords reclining on their shoulders.\r\nThe Master (St. George) dances, and then strikes the sword of James of\r\nSpain, who follows George, then dances, strikes the sword of Dennis, who\r\nfollows behind James. In like manner the rest--the music playing--swords\r\nas before. After the six are brought out of rank, they and the master\r\nform a circle, and hold the swords point and hilt. This circle is danced\r\nround twice. The whole, headed by the master, pass under the swords held\r\nin a vaulted manner. They jump over the swords. This naturally places\r\nthe swords across, which they disentangle by passing under their right\r\nsword. They take up the seven swords, and form a circle, in which they\r\ndance round.\r\n\r\n\"The master runs under the sword opposite, which he jumps over\r\nbackwards. The others do the same. He then passes under the right-hand\r\nsword, which the others follow, in which position they dance, until\r\ncommanded by the master, when they form into a circle, and dance round\r\nas before. They then jump over the right-hand sword, by which means\r\ntheir backs are to the circle, and their hands across their backs. They\r\ndance round in that form until the master calls 'Loose,' when they pass\r\nunder the right sword, and are in a perfect circle.\r\n\r\n\"The master lays down his sword, and lays hold of the point of James's\r\nsword. He then turns himself, James, and the others, into a clew. When\r\nso formed, he passes under out of the midst of the circle; the others\r\nfollow; they vault as before. After several other evolutions, they throw\r\nthemselves into a circle, with their arms across the breast. They\r\nafterwards form such figures as to form a shield of their swords, and\r\nthe shield is so compact that the master and his knights dance\r\nalternately with this shield upon their heads. It is then laid down upon\r\nthe floor. Each knight lays hold of their former points and hilts with\r\ntheir hands across, which disentangle by figuirs directly contrary to\r\nthose that formed the shield. This finishes the Ballet.\r\n\r\n\"EPILOGUE.\r\n\r\n  Mars does rule, he bends his brows,\r\n  He makes us all agast;[69]\r\n  After the few hours that we stay here,\r\n  Venus will rule at last.\r\n\r\n  Farewell, farewell, brave gentles all,\r\n  That herein do remain,\r\n  I wish you health and happiness\r\n  Till we return again.                          [_Exeunt._\"\r\n\r\nThe manuscript from which the above was copied was transcribed from _a\r\nvery old one_, by Mr. William Henderson, Jun., of Papa Stour, in\r\nZetland. Mr. Henderson's copy is not dated, but bears his own signature,\r\nand, from various circumstances, it is known to have been written about\r\nthe year 1788.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote VIII., p. 299--THE DWARFIE STONE.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the wonders of the Orkney Islands, though it has been\r\nrather undervalued by their late historian, Mr. Barry. The island of Hoy\r\nrises abruptly, starting as it were out of the sea, which is contrary to\r\nthe gentle and flat character of the other Isles of Orkney. It consists\r\nof a mountain, having different eminences or peaks. It is very steep,\r\nfurrowed with ravines, and placed so as to catch the mists of the\r\nWestern Ocean, and has a noble and picturesque effect from all points of\r\nview. The highest peak is divided from another eminence, called the\r\nWard-hill, by a long swampy valley full of peat-bogs. Upon the slope of\r\nthis last hill, and just where the principal mountain of Hoy opens in a\r\nhollow swamp, or corrie, lies what is called the Dwarfie Stone. It is a\r\ngreat fragment of sandstone, composing one solid mass, which has long\r\nsince been detached from a belt of the same materials, cresting the\r\neminence above the spot where it now lies, and which has slid down till\r\nit reached its present situation. The rock is about seven feet high,\r\ntwenty-two feet long, and seventeen feet broad. The upper end of it is\r\nhollowed by iron tools, of which the marks are evident, into a sort of\r\napartment, containing two beds of stone, with a passage between them.\r\nThe uppermost and largest bed is five feet eight inches long, by two\r\nfeet broad, which was supposed to be used by the dwarf himself; the\r\nlower couch is shorter, and rounded off, instead of being squared at the\r\ncorners. There is an entrance of about three feet and a half square, and\r\na stone lies before it calculated to fit the opening. A sort of skylight\r\nwindow gives light to the apartment. We can only guess at the purpose of\r\nthis monument, and different ideas have been suggested. Some have\r\nsupposed it the work of some travelling mason; but the _cui bono_ would\r\nremain to be accounted for. The Rev. Mr. Barry conjectures it to be a\r\nhermit's cell; but it displays no symbol of Christianity, and the door\r\nopens to the westward. The Orcadian traditions allege the work to be\r\nthat of a dwarf, to whom they ascribe supernatural powers, and a\r\nmalevolent disposition, the attributes of that race in Norse mythology.\r\nWhoever inhabited this singular den certainly enjoyed\r\n\r\n  \"Pillow cold, and sheets not warm.\"\r\n\r\nI observed, that commencing just opposite to the Dwarfie Stone, and\r\nextending in a line to the sea-beach, there are a number of small\r\nbarrows, or cairns, which seem to connect the stone with a very large\r\ncairn where we landed. This curious monument may therefore have been\r\nintended as a temple of some kind to the Northern Dii Manes, to which\r\nthe cairns might direct worshippers.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote IX., p. 299.--CARBUNCLE ON THE WARD-HILL.\r\n\r\n\"At the west end of this stone, (_i. e._ the Dwarfie Stone,) stands an\r\nexceeding high mountain of a steep ascent, called the Ward-hill of Hoy,\r\nnear the top of which, in the months of May, June, and July, about\r\nmidnight, is seen something that shines and sparkles admirably, and\r\nwhich is often seen a great way off. It hath shined more brightly\r\nbefore than it does now, and though many have climbed up the hill, and\r\nattempted to search for it, yet they could find nothing. The vulgar\r\ntalk of it as some enchanted carbuncle, but I take it rather to be some\r\nwater sliding down the face of a smooth rock, which, when the sun,\r\nat such a time, shines upon, the reflection causeth that admirable\r\nsplendour.\"--DR. WALLACE'S _Description of the Islands of Orkney_,\r\n12mo, 1700, p. 52.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[61] So placed in the old MS.\r\n\r\n[62] _Boor_--so spelt, to accord with the vulgar pronunciation of the\r\nword _bower_.\r\n\r\n[63] _Porte_--so spelt in the original.

In the \"Raven Song,\" an old Norse lay, the Valkyrie asks the\r\nRaven about Harold Fair Hair's Bearsarks. \"Wolfcoats they call them,\r\nthat bear bloody targets in battle, that redden their spear heads when\r\nthey come into fight, when they are at work together. The wise king, I\r\ntrow, will only reward men of high renown among them that smite on the\r\nshield.\" Later, perhaps, the Bearsarks won their evil reputation, as\r\nravening maniacs of battle, given to biting their shields and behaving\r\nin an hysterical manner. In such sagas as that of Grettir they are\r\nviolent bullies, sometimes selling their services. (See Powell and\r\nVigfussen's \"Corpus Boreale,\" i. 257.)\r\n\r\n(_d_) p. 27. Motto.

Superstition, when not arrayed in her full horrors, but\r\nlaying a gentle hand only on her suppliant's head, had charms which we\r\nfail not to regret, even in those stages of society from which her\r\ninfluence is wellnigh banished by the light of reason and general\r\neducation. At least, in more ignorant periods, her system of ideal\r\nterrors had something in them interesting to minds which had few means\r\nof excitement. This is more especially true of those lighter\r\nmodifications of superstitious feelings and practices which mingle in\r\nthe amusements of the ruder ages, and are, like the auguries of\r\nHallow-e'en in Scotland, considered partly as matter of merriment,\r\npartly as sad and prophetic earnest. And, with similar feelings, people\r\neven of tolerable education have, in our times, sought the cell of a\r\nfortune-teller, upon a frolic, as it is termed, and yet not always in a\r\ndisposition absolutely sceptical towards the responses they receive.\r\n\r\nWhen the sisters of Burgh-Westra arrived in the apartment destined for a\r\nbreakfast, as ample as that which we have described on the preceding\r\nmorning, and had undergone a jocular rebuke from the Udaller for their\r\nlate attendance, they found the company, most of whom had already\r\nbreakfasted, engaged in an ancient Norwegian custom, of the character\r\nwhich we have just described.\r\n\r\nIt seems to have been borrowed from those poems of the Scalds, in which\r\nchampions and heroines are so often represented as seeking to know their\r\ndestiny from some sorceress or prophetess, who, as in the legend called\r\nby Gray the Descent of Odin, awakens by the force of Runic rhyme the\r\nunwilling revealer of the doom of fate, and compels from her answers,\r\noften of dubious import, but which were then believed to express some\r\nshadow of the events of futurity.\r\n\r\nAn old sibyl, Euphane Fea, the housekeeper we have already mentioned,\r\nwas installed in the recess of a large window, studiously darkened by\r\nbear-skins and other miscellaneous drapery, so as to give it something\r\nthe appearance of a Laplander's hut, and accommodated, like a\r\nconfessional chair, with an aperture, which permitted the person within\r\nto hear with ease whatever questions should be put, though not to see\r\nthe querist. Here seated, the voluspa, or sibyl, was to listen to the\r\nrhythmical enquiries which should be made to her, and return an\r\nextemporaneous answer. The drapery was supposed to prevent her from\r\nseeing by what individuals she was consulted, and the intended or\r\naccidental reference which the answer given under such circumstances\r\nbore to the situation of the person by whom the question was asked,\r\noften furnished food for laughter, and sometimes, as it happened, for\r\nmore serious reflection. The sibyl was usually chosen from her\r\npossessing the talent of improvisation in the Norse poetry; no unusual\r\naccomplishment, where the minds of many were stored with old verses, and\r\nwhere the rules of metrical composition are uncommonly simple. The\r\nquestions were also put in verse; but as this power of extemporaneous\r\ncomposition, though common, could not be supposed universal, the medium\r\nof an interpreter might be used by any querist, which interpreter,\r\nholding the consulter of the oracle by the hand, and standing by the\r\nplace from which the oracles were issued, had the task of rendering into\r\nverse the subject of enquiry.\r\n\r\nOn the present occasion, Claud Halcro was summoned, by the universal\r\nvoice, to perform the part of interpreter; and, after shaking his head,\r\nand muttering some apology for decay of memory and poetical powers,\r\ncontradicted at once by his own conscious smile of confidence and by the\r\ngeneral shout of the company, the lighthearted old man came forward to\r\nplay his part in the proposed entertainment.\r\n\r\nBut just as it was about to commence, the arrangement of parts was\r\nsingularly altered. Norna of the Fitful-head, whom every one excepting\r\nthe two sisters believed to be at the distance of many miles, suddenly,\r\nand without greeting, entered the apartment, walked majestically up to\r\nthe bearskin tabernacle, and signed to the female who was there seated\r\nto abdicate her sanctuary. The old woman came forth, shaking her head,\r\nand looking like one overwhelmed with fear; nor, indeed, were there many\r\nin the company who saw with absolute composure the sudden appearance of\r\na person, so well known and so generally dreaded as Norna.\r\n\r\nShe paused a moment at the entrance of the tent; and, as she raised the\r\nskin which formed the entrance, she looked up to the north, as if\r\nimploring from that quarter a strain of inspiration; then signing to the\r\nsurprised guests that they might approach in succession the shrine in\r\nwhich she was about to install herself, she entered the tent, and was\r\nshrouded from their sight.\r\n\r\nBut this was a different sport from what the company had meditated, and\r\nto most of them seemed to present so much more of earnest than of game,\r\nthat there was no alacrity shown to consult the oracle. The character\r\nand pretensions of Norna seemed, to almost all present, too serious for\r\nthe part which she had assumed; the men whispered to each other, and the\r\nwomen, according to Claud Halcro, realized the description of glorious\r\nJohn Dryden,--\r\n\r\n  \"With horror shuddering, in a heap they ran.\"\r\n\r\nThe pause was interrupted by the loud manly voice of the Udaller. \"Why\r\ndoes the game stand still, my masters? Are you afraid because my\r\nkinswoman is to play our voluspa? It is kindly done in her, to do for us\r\nwhat none in the isles can do so well; and we will not baulk our sport\r\nfor it, but rather go on the merrier.\"\r\n\r\nThere was still a pause in the company, and Magnus Troil added, \"It\r\nshall never be said that my kinswoman sat in her bower unhalsed, as if\r\nshe were some of the old mountain-giantesses, and all from faint heart.\r\nI will speak first myself; but the rhyme comes worse from my tongue than\r\nwhen I was a score of years younger.--Claud Halcro, you must stand by\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nHand in hand they approached the shrine of the supposed sibyl, and after\r\na moment's consultation together, Halcro thus expressed the query of his\r\nfriend and patron. Now, the Udaller, like many persons of consequence in\r\nZetland, who, as Sir Robert Sibbald has testified for them, had begun\r\nthus early to apply both to commerce and navigation, was concerned to\r\nsome extent in the whale-fishery of the season, and the bard had been\r\ndirected to put into his halting verse an enquiry concerning its\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nCLAUD HALCRO.\r\n\r\n  \"Mother darksome, Mother dread--\r\n  Dweller on the Fitful-head,\r\n  Thou canst see what deeds are done\r\n  Under the never-setting sun.\r\n  Look through sleet, and look through frost,\r\n  Look to Greenland's caves and coast,--\r\n  By the iceberg is a sail\r\n  Chasing of the swarthy whale;\r\n  Mother doubtful, Mother dread,\r\n  Tell us, has the good ship sped?\"\r\n\r\nThe jest seemed to turn to earnest, as all, bending their heads around,\r\nlistened to the voice of Norna, who, without a moment's hesitation,\r\nanswered from the recesses of the tent in which she was enclosed:--\r\n\r\nNORNA.\r\n\r\n  \"The thought of the aged is ever on gear,--\r\n  On his fishing, his furrow, his flock, and his steer;\r\n  But thrive may his fishing, flock, furrow, and herd,\r\n  While the aged for anguish shall tear his grey beard.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a momentary pause, during which Triptolemus had time to\r\nwhisper, \"If ten witches and as many warlocks were to swear it, I will\r\nnever believe that a decent man will either fash his beard or himself\r\nabout any thing, so long as stock and crop goes as it should do.\"\r\n\r\nBut the voice from within the tent resumed its low monotonous tone of\r\nrecitation, and, interrupting farther commentary, proceeded as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\nNORNA.\r\n\r\n  \"The ship, well-laden as bark need be,\r\n  Lies deep in the furrow of the Iceland sea;--\r\n  The breeze for Zetland blows fair and soft,\r\n  And gaily the garland[1] is fluttering aloft:\r\n  Seven good fishes have spouted their last,\r\n  And their jaw-bones are hanging to yard and mast;[2]\r\n  Two are for Lerwick, and two for Kirkwall,--\r\n  And three for Burgh-Westra, the choicest of all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now the powers above look down and protect us!\" said Bryce Snailsfoot;\r\n\"for it is mair than woman's wit that has spaed out that ferly. I saw\r\nthem at North Ronaldshaw, that had seen the good bark, the Olave of\r\nLerwick, that our worthy patron has such a great share in that she may\r\nbe called his own in a manner, and they had broomed[3] the ship, and, as\r\nsure as there are stars in heaven, she answered them for seven fish,\r\nexact as Norna has telled us in her rhyme!\"\r\n\r\n\"Umph--seven fish exactly? and you heard it at North Ronaldshaw?\" said\r\nCaptain Cleveland, \"and I suppose told it as a good piece of news when\r\nyou came hither?\"\r\n\r\n\"It never crossed my tongue, Captain,\" answered the pedlar; \"I have kend\r\nmony chapmen, travelling merchants, and such like, neglect their goods\r\nto carry clashes and clavers up and down, from one countryside to\r\nanother; but that is no traffic of mine. I dinna believe I have\r\nmentioned the Olave's having made up her cargo to three folks since I\r\ncrossed to Dunrossness.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if one of those three had spoken the news over again, and it is two\r\nto one that such a thing happened, the old lady prophesies upon velvet.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the speech of Cleveland, addressed to Magnus Troil, and heard\r\nwithout any applause. The Udaller's respect for his country extended to\r\nits superstitions, and so did the interest which he took in his\r\nunfortunate kinswoman. If he never rendered a precise assent to her high\r\nsupernatural pretensions, he was not at least desirous of hearing them\r\ndisputed by others.\r\n\r\n\"Norna,\" he said, \"his cousin,\" (an emphasis on the word,) \"held no\r\ncommunication with Bryce Snailsfoot, or his acquaintances. He did not\r\npretend to explain how she came by her information; but he had always\r\nremarked that Scotsmen, and indeed strangers in general, when they came\r\nto Zetland, were ready to find reasons for things which remained\r\nsufficiently obscure to those whose ancestors had dwelt there for ages.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Cleveland took the hint, and bowed, without attempting to defend\r\nhis own scepticism.\r\n\r\n\"And now forward, my brave hearts,\" said the Udaller; \"and may all have\r\nas good tidings as I have! Three whales cannot but yield--let me think\r\nhow many hogsheads\"----\r\n\r\nThere was an obvious reluctance on the part of the guests to be the next\r\nin consulting the oracle of the tent.\r\n\r\n\"Gude news are welcome to some folks, if they came frae the deil\r\nhimsell,\" said Mistress Baby Yellowley, addressing the Lady\r\nGlowrowrum,--for a similarity of disposition in some respects had made a\r\nsort of intimacy betwixt them--\"but I think, my leddy, that this has\r\nower mickle of rank witchcraft in it to have the countenance of douce\r\nChristian folks like you and me, my leddy.\"\r\n\r\n\"There may be something in what you say, my dame,\" replied the good Lady\r\nGlowrowrum; \"but we Hialtlanders are no just like other folks; and this\r\nwoman, if she be a witch, being the Fowd's friend and near kinswoman, it\r\nwill be ill taen if we haena our fortunes spaed like a' the rest of\r\nthem; and sae my nieces may e'en step forward in their turn, and nae\r\nharm dune. They will hae time to repent, ye ken, in the course of\r\nnature, if there be ony thing wrang in it, Mistress Yellowley.\"\r\n\r\nWhile others remained under similar uncertainty and apprehension,\r\nHalcro, who saw by the knitting of the old Udaller's brows, and by a\r\ncertain impatient shuffle of his right foot, like the motion of a man\r\nwho with difficulty refrains from stamping, that his patience began to\r\nwax rather thin, gallantly declared, that he himself would, in his own\r\nperson, and not as a procurator for others, put the next query to the\r\nPythoness. He paused a minute--collected his rhymes, and thus addressed\r\nher:\r\n\r\nCLAUD HALCRO.\r\n\r\n  \"Mother doubtful, Mother dread,\r\n  Dweller of the Fitful-head,\r\n  Thou hast conn'd full many a rhyme,\r\n  That lives upon the surge of time:\r\n  Tell me, shall my lays be sung,\r\n  Like Hacon's of the golden tongue,\r\n  Long after Halcro's dead and gone?\r\n  Or, shall Hialtland's minstrel own\r\n  One note to rival glorious John?\"\r\n\r\nThe voice of the sibyl immediately replied, from her sanctuary,\r\n\r\nNORNA.\r\n\r\n  \"The infant loves the rattle's noise;\r\n  Age, double childhood, hath its toys;\r\n  But different far the descant rings,\r\n  As strikes a different hand the strings.\r\n  The Eagle mounts the polar sky--\r\n  The Imber-goose, unskill'd to fly,\r\n  Must be content to glide along,\r\n  Where seal and sea-dog list his song.\"\r\n\r\nHalcro bit his lip, shrugged his shoulders, and then, instantly\r\nrecovering his good-humour, and the ready, though slovenly power of\r\nextemporaneous composition, with which long habit had invested him, he\r\ngallantly rejoined,\r\n\r\nCLAUD HALCRO.\r\n\r\n  \"Be mine the Imber-goose to play,\r\n  And haunt lone cave and silent bay:--\r\n  The archer's aim so shall I shun--\r\n  So shall I 'scape the levell'd gun--\r\n  Content my verse's tuneless jingle,\r\n  With Thule's sounding tides to mingle,\r\n  While, to the ear of wandering wight,\r\n  Upon the distant headland's height,\r\n  Soften'd by murmur of the sea,\r\n  The rude sounds seem like harmony!\"\r\n\r\nAs the little bard stepped back, with an alert gait, and satisfied air,\r\ngeneral applause followed the spirited manner in which he had acquiesced\r\nin the doom which levelled him with an Imber-goose. But his resigned and\r\ncourageous submission did not even yet encourage any other person to\r\nconsult the redoubted Norna.\r\n\r\n\"The coward fools!\" said the Udaller. \"Are you too afraid, Captain\r\nCleveland, to speak to an old woman?--Ask her any thing--ask her whether\r\nthe twelve-gun sloop at Kirkwall be your consort or no.\"\r\n\r\nCleveland looked at Minna, and probably conceiving that she watched with\r\nanxiety his answer to her father's question, he collected himself, after\r\na moment's hesitation.\r\n\r\n\"I never was afraid of man or woman.--Master Halcro, you have heard the\r\nquestion which our host desires me to ask--put it in my name, and in\r\nyour own way--I pretend to as little skill in poetry as I do in\r\nwitchcraft.\"\r\n\r\nHalcro did not wait to be invited twice, but, grasping Captain\r\nCleveland's hand in his, according to the form which the game\r\nprescribed, he put the query which the Udaller had dictated to the\r\nstranger, in the following words:--\r\n\r\nCLAUD HALCRO.\r\n\r\n  \"Mother doubtful, Mother dread,\r\n  Dweller of the Fitful-head,\r\n  A gallant bark from far abroad,\r\n  Saint Magnus hath her in his road,\r\n  With guns and firelocks not a few--\r\n  A silken and a scarlet crew,\r\n  Deep stored with precious merchandise,\r\n  Of gold, and goods of rare device--\r\n  What interest hath our comrade bold\r\n  In bark and crew, in goods and gold?\"\r\n\r\nThere was a pause of unusual duration ere the oracle would return any\r\nanswer; and when she replied, it was in a lower, though an equally\r\ndecided tone, with that which she had hitherto employed:--\r\n\r\nNORNA.\r\n\r\n  \"Gold is ruddy, fair, and free,\r\n  Blood is crimson, and dark to see;--\r\n  I look'd out on Saint Magnus Bay,\r\n  And I saw a falcon that struck her prey,--\r\n  A gobbet of flesh in her beak she bore,\r\n  And talons and singles are dripping with gore;\r\n  Let him that asks after them look on his hand,\r\n  And if there is blood on't, he's one of their band.\"\r\n\r\nCleveland smiled scornfully, and held out his hand,--\"Few men have been\r\non the Spanish main as often as I have, without having had to do with\r\nthe _Guarda Costas_ once and again; but there never was aught like a\r\nstain on my hand that a wet towel would not wipe away.\"\r\n\r\nThe Udaller added his voice potential--\"There is never peace with\r\nSpaniards beyond the Line,--I have heard Captain Tragendeck and honest\r\nold Commodore Rummelaer say so an hundred times, and they have both been\r\ndown in the Bay of Honduras, and all thereabouts.--I hate all Spaniards,\r\nsince they came here and reft the Fair Isle men of their vivers in\r\n1558.[4] I have heard my grandfather speak of it; and there is an old\r\nDutch history somewhere about the house, that shows what work they made\r\nin the Low Countries long since. There is neither mercy nor faith in\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"True--true, my old friend,\" said Cleveland; \"they are as jealous of\r\ntheir Indian possessions as an old man of his young bride; and if they\r\ncan catch you at disadvantage, the mines for your life is the word,--and\r\nso we fight them with our colours nailed to the mast.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is the way,\" shouted the Udaller; \"the old British jack should\r\nnever down! When I think of the wooden walls, I almost think myself an\r\nEnglishman, only it would be becoming too like my Scottish\r\nneighbours;--but come, no offence to any here, gentlemen--all are\r\nfriends, and all are welcome.--Come, Brenda, go on with the play--do you\r\nspeak next, you have Norse rhymes enough, we all know.\"\r\n\r\n\"But none that suit the game we play at, father,\" said Brenda, drawing\r\nback.\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense!\" said her father, pushing her onward, while Halcro seized on\r\nher reluctant hand; \"never let mistimed modesty mar honest mirth--Speak\r\nfor Brenda, Halcro--it is your trade to interpret maidens' thoughts.\"\r\n\r\nThe poet bowed to the beautiful young woman, with the devotion of a poet\r\nand the gallantry of a traveller, and having, in a whisper, reminded her\r\nthat she was in no way responsible for the nonsense he was about to\r\nspeak, he paused, looked upward, simpered as if he had caught a sudden\r\nidea, and at length set off in the following verses:\r\n\r\nCLAUD HALCRO.\r\n\r\n  \"Mother doubtful, Mother dread--\r\n  Dweller of the Fitful-head,\r\n  Well thou know'st it is thy task\r\n  To tell what beauty will not ask;--\r\n  Then steep thy words in wine and milk,\r\n  And weave a doom of gold and silk,--\r\n  For we would know, shall Brenda prove\r\n  In love, and happy in her love?\"\r\n\r\nThe prophetess replied almost immediately from behind her curtain:--\r\n\r\nNORNA.\r\n\r\n  \"Untouched by love, the maiden's breast\r\n  Is like the snow on Rona's crest,\r\n  High seated in the middle sky,\r\n  In bright and barren purity;\r\n  But by the sunbeam gently kiss'd,\r\n  Scarce by the gazing eye 'tis miss'd,\r\n  Ere down the lonely valley stealing,\r\n  Fresh grass and growth its course revealing,\r\n  It cheers the flock, revives the flower,\r\n  And decks some happy shepherd's bower.\"\r\n\r\n\"A comfortable doctrine, and most justly spoken,\" said the Udaller,\r\nseizing the blushing Brenda, as she was endeavouring to escape--\"Never\r\nthink shame for the matter, my girl. To be the mistress of some honest\r\nman's house, and the means of maintaining some old Norse name, making\r\nneighbours happy, the poor easy, and relieving strangers, is the most\r\ncreditable lot a young woman can look to, and I heartily wish it to all\r\nhere.--Come, who speaks next?--good husbands are going--Maddie\r\nGroatsettar--my pretty Clara, come and have your share.\"\r\n\r\nThe Lady Glowrowrum shook her head, and \"could not,\" she said,\r\n\"altogether approve\"----\r\n\r\n\"Enough said--enough said,\" replied Magnus; \"no compulsion; but the play\r\nshall go on till we are tired of it. Here, Minna--I have got you at\r\ncommand. Stand forth, my girl--there are plenty of things to be ashamed\r\nof besides old-fashioned and innocent pleasantry.--Come, I will speak\r\nfor you myself--though I am not sure I can remember rhyme enough for\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a slight colour which passed rapidly over Minna's face, but\r\nshe instantly regained her composure, and stood erect by her father, as\r\none superior to any little jest to which her situation might give rise.\r\n\r\nHer father, after some rubbing of his brow, and other mechanical efforts\r\nto assist his memory, at length recovered verse sufficient to put the\r\nfollowing query, though in less gallant strains than those of Halcro:--\r\n\r\nMAGNUS TROIL.\r\n\r\n  \"Mother, speak, and do not tarry,\r\n  Here's a maiden fain would marry.\r\n  Shall she marry, ay or not?\r\n  If she marry, what's her lot?\"\r\n\r\nA deep sigh was uttered within the tabernacle of the soothsayer, as if\r\nshe compassionated the subject of the doom which she was obliged to\r\npronounce. She then, as usual, returned her response:--\r\n\r\nNORNA.\r\n\r\n  \"Untouch'd by love, the maiden's breast\r\n  Is like the snow on Rona's crest;\r\n  So pure, so free from earthly dye,\r\n  It seems, whilst leaning on the sky,\r\n  Part of the heaven to which 'tis nigh;\r\n  But passion, like the wild March rain,\r\n  May soil the wreath with many a stain.\r\n  We gaze--the lovely vision's gone--\r\n  A torrent fills the bed of stone,\r\n  That, hurrying to destruction's shock,\r\n  Leaps headlong from the lofty rock.\"\r\n\r\nThe Udaller heard this reply with high resentment. \"By the bones of the\r\nMartyr,\" he said, his bold visage becoming suddenly ruddy, \"this is an\r\nabuse of courtesy! and, were it any but yourself that had classed my\r\ndaughter's name and the word destruction together, they had better have\r\nleft the word unspoken. But come forth of the tent, thou old\r\ngaldragon,\"[5] he added, with a smile--\"I should have known that thou\r\ncanst not long joy in any thing that smacks of mirth, God help thee!\"\r\nHis summons received no answer; and, after waiting a moment, he again\r\naddressed her--\"Nay, never be sullen with me, kinswoman, though I did\r\nspeak a hasty word--thou knowest I bear malice to no one, least of all\r\nto thee--so come forth, and let us shake hands.--Thou mightst have\r\nforetold the wreck of my ship and boats, or a bad herring-fishery, and I\r\nshould have said never a word; but Minna or Brenda, you know, are things\r\nwhich touch me nearer. But come out, shake hands, and there let there be\r\nan end on't.\"\r\n\r\nNorna returned no answer whatever to his repeated invocations, and the\r\ncompany began to look upon each other with some surprise, when the\r\nUdaller, raising the skin which covered the entrance of the tent,\r\ndiscovered that the interior was empty. The wonder was now general, and\r\nnot unmixed with fear; for it seemed impossible that Norna could have,\r\nin any manner, escaped from the tabernacle in which she was enclosed,\r\nwithout having been discovered by the company. Gone, however, she was,\r\nand the Udaller, after a moment's consideration, dropt the skin-curtain\r\nagain over the entrance of the tent.\r\n\r\n\"My friends,\" he said, with a cheerful countenance, \"we have long known\r\nmy kinswoman, and that her ways are not like those of the ordinary folks\r\nof this world. But she means well by Hialtland, and hath the love of a\r\nsister for me, and for my house; and no guest of mine needs either to\r\nfear evil, or to take offence, at her hand. I have little doubt she will\r\nbe with us at dinner-time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Heaven forbid!\" said Mrs. Baby Yellowley--\"for, my gude Leddy\r\nGlowrowrum, to tell your leddyship the truth, I likena cummers that can\r\ncome and gae like a glance of the sun, or the whisk of a whirlwind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak lower, speak lower,\" said the Lady Glowrowrum, \"and be thankful\r\nthat yon carlin hasna ta'en the house-side away wi' her. The like of her\r\nhave played warse pranks, and so has she hersell, unless she is the\r\nsairer lied on.\"\r\n\r\nSimilar murmurs ran through the rest of the company, until the Udaller\r\nuplifted his stentorian and imperative voice to put them to silence, and\r\ninvited, or rather commanded, the attendance of his guests to behold the\r\nboats set off for the _haaf_ or deep-sea fishing.\r\n\r\n\"The wind has been high since sunrise,\" he said, \"and had kept the boats\r\nin the bay; but now it was favourable, and they would sail\r\nimmediately.\"\r\n\r\nThis sudden alteration of the weather occasioned sundry nods and winks\r\namongst the guests, who were not indisposed to connect it with Norna's\r\nsudden disappearance; but without giving vent to observations which\r\ncould not but be disagreeable to their host, they followed his stately\r\nstep to the shore, as the herd of deer follows the leading stag, with\r\nall manner of respectful observance.[6](_a_)[7]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The garland is an artificial coronet, composed of ribbons by those\r\nyoung women who take an interest in a whaling vessel or her crew: it is\r\nalways displayed from the rigging, and preserved with great care during\r\nthe voyage.\r\n\r\n[2] The best oil exudes from the jaw-bones of the whale, which, for the\r\npurpose of collecting it, are suspended to the masts of the vessel.\r\n\r\n[3] There is established among whalers a sort of telegraphic signal, in\r\nwhich a certain number of motions, made with a broom, express to any\r\nother vessel the number of fish which they have caught.\r\n\r\n[4] The Admiral of the Spanish Armada was wrecked on the Fair Isle,\r\nhalf-way betwixt the Orkney and Zetland Archipelago.

The fishing season\r\nis therefore, like the harvest of an agricultural country, the busiest\r\nand most important, as well as the most animating, period of the year.\r\n\r\nThe fishermen of each district assemble at particular stations, with\r\ntheir boats and crews, and erect upon the shore small huts, composed of\r\nshingle and covered with turf, for their temporary lodging, and skeos,\r\nor drying-houses, for the fish; so that the lonely beach at once assumes\r\nthe appearance of an Indian town. The banks to which they repair for the\r\nHaaf fishing, are often many miles distant from the station where the\r\nfish is dried; so that they are always twenty or thirty hours absent,\r\nfrequently longer; and under unfavourable circumstances of wind and\r\ntide, they remain at sea, with a very small stock of provisions, and in\r\na boat of a construction which seems extremely slender, for two or three\r\ndays, and are sometimes heard of no more. The departure of the fishers,\r\ntherefore, on this occupation, has in it a character of danger and of\r\nsuffering, which renders it dignified, and the anxiety of the females\r\nwho remain on the beach, watching the departure of the lessening boat,\r\nor anxiously looking out for its return, gives pathos to the scene.[8]\r\n\r\nThe scene, therefore, was in busy and anxious animation, when the\r\nUdaller and his friends appeared on the beach. The various crews of\r\nabout thirty boats, amounting each to from three to five or six men,\r\nwere taking leave of their wives and female relatives, and jumping on\r\nboard their long Norway skiffs, where their lines and tackle lay ready\r\nstowed. Magnus was not an idle spectator of the scene; he went from one\r\nplace to another, enquiring into the state of their provisions for the\r\nvoyage, and their preparations for the fishing--now and then, with a\r\nrough Dutch or Norse oath, abusing them for blockheads, for going to sea\r\nwith their boats indifferently found, but always ending by ordering\r\nfrom his own stores a gallon of gin, a lispund of meal, or some similar\r\nessential addition to their sea-stores. The hardy sailors, on receiving\r\nsuch favours, expressed their thanks in the brief gruff manner which\r\ntheir landlord best approved; but the women were more clamorous in their\r\ngratitude, which Magnus was often obliged to silence by cursing all\r\nfemale tongues from Eve's downwards.\r\n\r\nAt length all were on board and ready, the sails were hoisted, the\r\nsignal for departure given, the rowers began to pull, and all started\r\nfrom the shore, in strong emulation to get first to the fishing ground,\r\nand to have their lines set before the rest; an exploit to which no\r\nlittle consequence was attached by the boat's crew who should be happy\r\nenough to perform it.\r\n\r\nWhile they were yet within hearing of the shore, they chanted an ancient\r\nNorse ditty, appropriate to the occasion, of which Claud Halcro had\r\nexecuted the following literal translation:--\r\n\r\n  \"Farewell, merry maidens, to song, and to laugh,\r\n  For the brave lads of Westra are bound to the Haaf;\r\n  And we must have labour, and hunger, and pain,\r\n  Ere we dance with the maids of Dunrossness again.\r\n\r\n  \"For now, in our trim boats of Noroway deal,\r\n  We must dance on the waves, with the porpoise and seal;\r\n  The breeze it shall pipe, so it pipe not too high,\r\n  And the gull be our songstress whene'er she flits by.\r\n\r\n  \"Sing on, my brave bird, while we follow, like thee,\r\n  By bank, shoal, and quicksand, the swarms of the sea;\r\n  And when twenty-score fishes are straining our line,\r\n  Sing louder, brave bird, for their spoils shall be thine.\r\n\r\n  \"We'll sing while we bait, and we'll sing when we haul,\r\n  For the deeps of the Haaf have enough for us all:\r\n  There is torsk for the gentle, and skate for the carle,\r\n  And there's wealth for bold Magnus, the son of the earl.\r\n\r\n  \"Huzza! my brave comrades, give way for the Haaf,\r\n  We shall sooner come back to the dance and the laugh;\r\n  For life without mirth is a lamp without oil;\r\n  Then, mirth and long life to the bold Magnus Troil!\"\r\n\r\nThe rude words of the song were soon drowned in the ripple of the waves,\r\nbut the tune continued long to mingle with the sound of wind and sea,\r\nand the boats were like so many black specks on the surface of the\r\nocean, diminishing by degrees as they bore far and farther seaward;\r\nwhile the ear could distinguish touches of the human voice, almost\r\ndrowned amid that of the elements.\r\n\r\nThe fishermen's wives looked their last after the parting sails, and\r\nwere now departing slowly, with downcast and anxious looks, towards the\r\nhuts in which they were to make arrangements for preparing and drying\r\nthe fish, with which they hoped to see their husbands and friends return\r\ndeeply laden. Here and there an old sibyl displayed the superior\r\nimportance of her experience, by predicting, from the appearance of the\r\natmosphere, that the wind would be fair or foul, while others\r\nrecommended a vow to the Kirk of St. Ninian's for the safety of their\r\nmen and boats, (an ancient Catholic superstition, not yet wholly\r\nabolished,) and others, but in a low and timorous tone, regretted to\r\ntheir companions, that Norna of Fitful-head had been suffered to depart\r\nin discontent that morning from Burgh-Westra, \"and, of all days in the\r\nyear, that they suld have contrived to give her displeasure on the first\r\nday of the white fishing!\"\r\n\r\nThe gentry, guests of Magnus Troil, having whiled away as much time as\r\ncould be so disposed of, in viewing the little armament set sail, and in\r\nconversing with the poor women who had seen their friends embark in it,\r\nbegan now to separate into various groups and parties, which strolled in\r\ndifferent directions, as fancy led them, to enjoy what may be called the\r\nclair-obscure of a Zetland summer day, which, though without the\r\nbrilliant sunshine that cheers other countries during the fine season,\r\nhas a mild and pleasing character of its own, that softens while it\r\nsaddens landscapes, which, in their own lonely, bare, and monotonous\r\ntone, have something in them stern as well as barren.\r\n\r\nIn one of the loneliest recesses of the coast, where a deep indenture of\r\nthe rocks gave the tide access to the cavern, or, as it is called, the\r\n_Helyer_, of Swartaster, Minna Troil was walking with Captain Cleveland.\r\nThey had probably chosen that walk, as being little liable to\r\ninterruption from others; for, as the force of the tide rendered the\r\nplace unfit either for fishing or sailing, so it was not the ordinary\r\nresort of walkers, on account of its being the supposed habitation of a\r\nMermaid, a race which Norwegian superstition invests with magical, as\r\nwell as mischievous qualities. Here, therefore, Minna wandered with her\r\nlover.\r\n\r\nA small spot of milk-white sand, that stretched beneath one of the\r\nprecipices which walled in the creek on either side, afforded them space\r\nfor a dry, firm, and pleasant walk of about an hundred yards, terminated\r\nat one extremity by a dark stretch of the bay, which, scarce touched by\r\nthe wind, seemed almost as smooth as glass, and which was seen from\r\nbetween two lofty rocks, the jaws of the creek, or indenture, that\r\napproached each other above, as if they wished to meet over the dark\r\ntide that separated them. The other end of their promenade was closed by\r\na lofty and almost unscaleable precipice, the abode of hundreds of\r\nsea-fowl of different kinds, in the bottom of which the huge helyer, or\r\nsea-cave, itself yawned, as if for the purpose of swallowing up the\r\nadvancing tide, which it seemed to receive into an abyss of immeasurable\r\ndepth and extent. The entrance to this dismal cavern consisted not in a\r\nsingle arch, as usual, but was divided into two, by a huge pillar of\r\nnatural rock, which, rising out of the sea, and extending to the top of\r\nthe cavern, seemed to lend its support to the roof, and thus formed a\r\ndouble portal to the helyer, on which the fishermen and peasants had\r\nbestowed the rude name of the Devil's Nostrils. In this wild scene,\r\nlonely and undisturbed but by the clang of the sea-fowl, Cleveland had\r\nalready met with Minna Troil more than once; for with her it was a\r\nfavourite walk, as the objects which it presented agreed peculiarly with\r\nthe love of the wild, the melancholy, and the wonderful. But now the\r\nconversation in which she was earnestly engaged, was such as entirely to\r\nwithdraw her attention, as well as that of her companion, from the\r\nscenery around them.\r\n\r\n\"You cannot deny it,\" she said; \"you have given way to feelings\r\nrespecting this young man, which indicate prejudice and violence,--the\r\nprejudice unmerited, as far as you are concerned at least, and the\r\nviolence equally imprudent and unjustifiable.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should have thought,\" replied Cleveland, \"that the service I rendered\r\nhim yesterday might have freed me from such a charge. I do not talk of\r\nmy own risk, for I have lived in danger, and love it; it is not every\r\none, however, would have ventured so near the furious animal to save one\r\nwith whom they had no connexion.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not every one, indeed, who could have saved him,\" answered\r\nMinna, gravely; \"but every one who has courage and generosity would have\r\nattempted it. The giddy-brained Claud Halcro would have done as much as\r\nyou, had his strength been equal to his courage,--my father would have\r\ndone as much, though having such just cause of resentment against the\r\nyoung man, for his vain and braggart abuse of our hospitality. Do not,\r\ntherefore, boast of your exploit too much, my good friend, lest you\r\nshould make me think that it required too great an effort. I know you\r\nlove not Mordaunt Mertoun, though you exposed your own life to save\r\nhis.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you allow nothing, then,\" said Cleveland, \"for the long misery I\r\nwas made to endure from the common and prevailing report, that this\r\nbeardless bird-hunter stood betwixt me and what I on earth coveted\r\nmost--the affections of Minna Troil?\"\r\n\r\nHe spoke in a tone at once impassioned and insinuating, and his whole\r\nlanguage and manner seemed to express a grace and elegance, which formed\r\nthe most striking contrast with the speech and gesture of the unpolished\r\nseaman, which he usually affected or exhibited. But his apology was\r\nunsatisfactory to Minna.\r\n\r\n\"You have known,\" she said, \"perhaps too soon, and too well, how little\r\nyou had to fear,--if you indeed feared,--that Mertoun, or any other, had\r\ninterest with Minna Troil.--Nay, truce to thanks and protestations; I\r\nwould accept it as the best proof of gratitude, that you would be\r\nreconciled with this youth, or at least avoid every quarrel with him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That we should be friends, Minna, is impossible,\" replied Cleveland;\r\n\"even the love I bear you, the most powerful emotion that my heart ever\r\nknew, cannot work that miracle.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why, I pray you?\" said Minna; \"there have been no evil offences\r\nbetween you, but rather an exchange of mutual services; why can you not\r\nbe friends?--I have many reasons to wish it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And can you, then, forget the slights which he has cast upon Brenda,\r\nand on yourself, and on your father's house?\"\r\n\r\n\"I can forgive them all,\" said Minna;--\"can you not say so much, who\r\nhave in truth received no offence?\"\r\n\r\nCleveland looked down, and paused for an instant; then raised his head,\r\nand replied, \"I might easily deceive you, Minna, and promise you what my\r\nsoul tells me is an impossibility; but I am forced to use too much\r\ndeceit with others, and with you I will use none. I cannot be friend to\r\nthis young man;--there is a natural dislike--an instinctive\r\naversion--something like a principle of repulsion in our mutual nature,\r\nwhich makes us odious to each other. Ask himself--he will tell you he\r\nhas the same antipathy against me. The obligation he conferred on me was\r\na bridle to my resentment; but I was so galled by the restraint, that I\r\ncould have gnawed the curb till my lips were bloody.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have worn what you are wont to call your iron mask so long, that\r\nyour features,\" replied Minna, \"retain the impression of its rigidity\r\neven when it is removed.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do me injustice, Minna,\" replied her lover, \"and you are angry with\r\nme because I deal with you plainly and honestly. Plainly and honestly,\r\nhowever, will I say, that I cannot be Mertoun's friend, but it shall be\r\nhis own fault, not mine, if I am ever his enemy. I seek not to injure\r\nhim; but do not ask me to love him. And of this remain satisfied, that\r\nit would be vain even if I could do so; for as sure as I attempted any\r\nadvances towards his confidence, so sure would I be to awaken his\r\ndisgust and suspicion. Leave us to the exercise of our natural feelings,\r\nwhich, as they will unquestionably keep us as far separate as possible,\r\nare most likely to prevent any possible interference with each\r\nother.--Does this satisfy you?\"\r\n\r\n\"It must,\" said Minna, \"since you tell me there is no remedy.--And now\r\ntell me why you looked so grave when you heard of your consort's\r\narrival,--for that it is her I have no doubt,--in the port of Kirkwall?\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear,\" replied Cleveland, \"the consequences of that vessel's arrival\r\nwith her crew, as comprehending the ruin of my fondest hopes. I had made\r\nsome progress in your father's favour, and, with time, might have made\r\nmore, when hither come Hawkins and the rest to blight my prospects for\r\never. I told you on what terms we parted. I then commanded a vessel\r\nbraver and better found than their own, with a crew who, at my slightest\r\nnod, would have faced fiends armed with their own fiery element; but I\r\nnow stand alone, a single man, destitute of all means to overawe or to\r\nrestrain them; and they will soon show so plainly the ungovernable\r\nlicense of their habits and dispositions, that ruin to themselves and to\r\nme will in all probability be the consequence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not fear it,\" said Minna; \"my father can never be so unjust as to\r\nhold you liable for the offences of others.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what will Magnus Troil say to my own demerits, fair Minna?\" said\r\nCleveland, smiling.\r\n\r\n\"My father is a Zetlander, or rather a Norwegian,\" said Minna, \"one of\r\nan oppressed race, who will not care whether you fought against the\r\nSpaniards, who are the tyrants of the New World, or against the Dutch\r\nand English, who have succeeded to their usurped dominions. His own\r\nancestors supported and exercised the freedom of the seas in those\r\ngallant barks, whose pennons were the dread of all Europe.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear, nevertheless,\" said Cleveland, \"that the descendant of an\r\nancient Sea-King will scarce acknowledge a fitting acquaintance in a\r\nmodern rover. I have not disguised from you that I have reason to dread\r\nthe English laws; and Magnus, though a great enemy to taxes, imposts,\r\nscat, wattle, and so forth, has no idea of latitude upon points of a\r\nmore general character;--he would willingly reeve a rope to the yard-arm\r\nfor the benefit of an unfortunate buccanier.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not suppose so,\" said Minna; \"he himself suffers too much oppression\r\nfrom the tyrannical laws of our proud neighbours of Scotland. I trust he\r\nwill soon be able to rise in resistance against them. The enemy--such I\r\nwill call them--are now divided amongst themselves, and every vessel\r\nfrom their coast brings intelligence of fresh commotions--the Highlands\r\nagainst the Lowlands--the Williamites against the Jacobites--the Whigs\r\nagainst the Tories, and, to sum the whole, the kingdom of England\r\nagainst that of Scotland. What is there, as Claud Halcro well hinted, to\r\nprevent our availing ourselves of the quarrels of these robbers, to\r\nassert the independence of which we are deprived?\"\r\n\r\n\"To hoist the raven standard on the Castle of Scalloway,\" said\r\nCleveland, in imitation of her tone and manner, \"and proclaim your\r\nfather Earl Magnus the First!\"\r\n\r\n\"Earl Magnus the Seventh, if it please you,\" answered Minna; \"for six of\r\nhis ancestors have worn, or were entitled to wear, the coronet before\r\nhim.--You laugh at my ardour,--but what _is_ there to prevent all this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing _will_ prevent it,\" replied Cleveland, \"because it will never\r\nbe attempted--Any thing _might_ prevent it, that is equal in strength to\r\nthe long-boat of a British man-of-war.\"\r\n\r\n\"You treat us with scorn, sir,\" said Minna; \"yet yourself should know\r\nwhat a few resolved men may perform.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they must be armed, Minna,\" replied Cleveland, \"and willing to\r\nplace their lives upon each desperate adventure.--Think not of such\r\nvisions. Denmark has been cut down into a second-rate kingdom, incapable\r\nof exchanging a single broadside with England; Norway is a starving\r\nwilderness; and, in these islands, the love of independence has been\r\nsuppressed by a long term of subjection, or shows itself but in a few\r\nmuttered growls over the bowl and bottle. And, were your men as willing\r\nwarriors as their ancestors, what could the unarmed crews of a few\r\nfishing-boats do against the British navy?--Think no more of it, sweet\r\nMinna--it is a dream, and I must term it so, though it makes your eye so\r\nbright, and your step so noble.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is indeed a dream!\" said Minna, looking down, \"and it ill becomes a\r\ndaughter of Hialtland to look or to move like a freewoman--Our eye\r\nshould be on the ground, and our step slow and reluctant, as that of one\r\nwho obeys a taskmaster.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are lands,\" said Cleveland, \"in which the eye may look bright\r\nupon groves of the palm and the cocoa, and where the foot may move\r\nlight as a galley under sail, over fields carpeted with flowers, and\r\nsavannahs surrounded by aromatic thickets, and where subjection is\r\nunknown, except that of the brave to the bravest, and of all to the most\r\nbeautiful.\"\r\n\r\nMinna paused a moment ere she spoke, and then answered, \"No, Cleveland.\r\nMy own rude country has charms for me, even desolate as you think it,\r\nand depressed as it surely is, which no other land on earth can offer to\r\nme. I endeavour in vain to represent to myself those visions of trees,\r\nand of groves, which my eye never saw; but my imagination can conceive\r\nno sight in nature more sublime than these waves, when agitated by a\r\nstorm, or more beautiful, than when they come, as they now do, rolling\r\nin calm tranquillity to the shore. Not the fairest scene in a foreign\r\nland,--not the brightest sunbeam that ever shone upon the richest\r\nlandscape, would win my thoughts for a moment from that lofty rock,\r\nmisty hill, and wide-rolling ocean. Hialtland is the land of my deceased\r\nancestors, and of my living father; and in Hialtland will I live and\r\ndie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then in Hialtland,\" answered Cleveland, \"will I too live and die. I\r\nwill not go to Kirkwall,--I will not make my existence known to my\r\ncomrades, from whom it were else hard for me to escape. Your father\r\nloves me, Minna; who knows whether long attention, anxious care, might\r\nnot bring him to receive me into his family? Who would regard the length\r\nof a voyage that was certain to terminate in happiness?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dream not of such an issue,\" said Minna; \"it is impossible. While you\r\nlive in my father's house,--while you receive his assistance, and share\r\nhis table, you will find him the generous friend, and the hearty host;\r\nbut touch him on what concerns his name and family, and the\r\nfrank-hearted Udaller will start up before you the haughty and proud\r\ndescendant of a Norwegian Jarl. See you,--a moment's suspicion has\r\nfallen on Mordaunt Mertoun, and he has banished from his favour the\r\nyouth whom he so lately loved as a son. No one must ally with his house\r\nthat is not of untainted northern descent.\"\r\n\r\n\"And mine may be so, for aught that is known to me upon the subject,\"\r\nsaid Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\"How!\" said Minna; \"have you any reason to believe yourself of Norse\r\ndescent?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have told you before,\" replied Cleveland, \"that my family is totally\r\nunknown to me. I spent my earliest days upon a solitary plantation in\r\nthe little island of Tortuga, under the charge of my father, then a\r\ndifferent person from what he afterwards became. We were plundered by\r\nthe Spaniards, and reduced to such extremity of poverty, that my father,\r\nin desperation, and in thirst of revenge, took up arms, and having\r\nbecome chief of a little band, who were in the same circumstances,\r\nbecame a buccanier, as it is called, and cruized against Spain, with\r\nvarious vicissitudes of good and bad fortune, until, while he interfered\r\nto check some violence of his companions, he fell by their hands--no\r\nuncommon fate among the captains of these rovers. But whence my father\r\ncame, or what was the place of his birth, I know not, fair Minna, nor\r\nhave I ever had a curious thought on the subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was a Briton, at least, your unfortunate father?\" said Minna.\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt of it,\" said Cleveland; \"his name, which I have\r\nrendered too formidable to be openly spoken, is an English one; and his\r\nacquaintance with the English language, and even with English\r\nliterature, together with the pains which he took, in better days, to\r\nteach me both, plainly spoke him to be an Englishman. If the rude\r\nbearing which I display towards others is not the genuine character of\r\nmy mind and manners, it is to my father, Minna, that I owe any share of\r\nbetter thoughts and principles, which may render me worthy, in some\r\nsmall degree, of your notice and approbation. And yet it sometimes seems\r\nto me, that I have two different characters; for I cannot bring myself\r\nto believe, that I, who now walk this lone beach with the lovely Minna\r\nTroil, and am permitted to speak to her of the passion which I have\r\ncherished, have ever been the daring leader of the bold band whose name\r\nwas as terrible as a tornado.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had not been permitted,\" said Minna, \"to use that bold language\r\ntowards the daughter of Magnus Troil, had you _not_ been the brave and\r\nundaunted leader, who, with so small means, has made his name so\r\nformidable. My heart is like that of a maiden of the ancient days, and\r\nis to be won, not by fair words, but by gallant deeds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! that heart,\" said Cleveland; \"and what is it that I may do--what\r\nis it that man can do, to win in it the interest which I desire?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rejoin your friends--pursue your fortunes--leave the rest to destiny,\"\r\nsaid Minna. \"Should you return, the leader of a gallant fleet, who can\r\ntell what may befall?\"\r\n\r\n\"And what shall assure me, that, when I return--if return I ever\r\nshall--I may not find Minna Troil a bride or a spouse?--No, Minna, I\r\nwill not trust to destiny the only object worth attaining, which my\r\nstormy voyage in life has yet offered me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear me,\" said Minna. \"I will bind myself to you, if you dare accept\r\nsuch an engagement, by the promise of Odin,[9] the most sacred of our\r\nnorthern rites which are yet practised among us, that I will never\r\nfavour another, until you resign the pretensions which I have given to\r\nyou.--Will that satisfy you?--for more I cannot--more I will not give.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then with that,\" said Cleveland, after a moment's pause, \"I must\r\nperforce be satisfied;--but remember, it is yourself that throw me back\r\nupon a mode of life which the laws of Britain denounce as criminal, and\r\nwhich the violent passions of the daring men by whom it is pursued, have\r\nrendered infamous.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I,\" said Minna, \"am superior to such prejudices. In warring with\r\nEngland, I see their laws in no other light than as if you were engaged\r\nwith an enemy, who, in fulness of pride and power, has declared he will\r\ngive his antagonist no quarter. A brave man will not fight the worse for\r\nthis;--and, for the manners of your comrades, so that they do not infect\r\nyour own, why should their evil report attach to you?\"\r\n\r\nCleveland gazed at her as she spoke, with a degree of wondering\r\nadmiration, in which, at the same time, there lurked a smile at her\r\nsimplicity.\r\n\r\n\"I could not,\" he said, \"have believed, that such high courage could\r\nhave been found united with such ignorance of the world, as the world is\r\nnow wielded. For my manners, they who best know me will readily allow,\r\nthat I have done my best, at the risk of my popularity, and of my life\r\nitself, to mitigate the ferocity of my mates; but how can you teach\r\nhumanity to men burning with vengeance against the world by whom they\r\nare proscribed, or teach them temperance and moderation in enjoying the\r\npleasures which chance throws in their way, to vary a life which would\r\nbe otherwise one constant scene of peril and hardship?--But this\r\npromise, Minna--this promise, which is all I am to receive in guerdon\r\nfor my faithful attachment--let me at least lose no time in claiming\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"It must not be rendered here, but in Kirkwall.--We must invoke, to\r\nwitness the engagement, the Spirit which presides over the ancient\r\nCircle of Stennis. But perhaps you fear to name the ancient Father of\r\nthe Slain too, the Severe, the Terrible?\"\r\n\r\nCleveland smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Do me the justice to think, lovely Minna, that I am little subject to\r\nfear real causes of terror; and for those which are visionary, I have no\r\nsympathy whatever.\"\r\n\r\n\"You believe not in them, then?\" said Minna, \"and are so far better\r\nsuited to be Brenda's lover than mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will believe,\" replied Cleveland, \"in whatever you believe. The whole\r\ninhabitants of that Valhalla, about which you converse so much with that\r\nfiddling, rhyming fool, Claud Halcro--all these shall become living and\r\nexisting things to my credulity. But, Minna, do not ask me to fear any\r\nof them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Fear! no--not to _fear_ them, surely,\" replied the maiden; \"for, not\r\nbefore Thor or Odin, when they approached in the fulness of their\r\nterrors, did the heroes of my dauntless race yield one foot in retreat.\r\nNor do I own them as Deities--a better faith prevents so foul an error.\r\nBut, in our own conception, they are powerful spirits for good or evil.\r\nAnd when you boast not to fear them, bethink you that you defy an enemy\r\nof a kind you have never yet encountered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in these northern latitudes,\" said the lover, with a smile, \"where\r\nhitherto I have seen but angels; but I have faced, in my time, the\r\ndemons of the Equinoctial Line, which we rovers suppose to be as\r\npowerful, and as malignant, as those of the North.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you, then, witnessed those wonders that are beyond the visible\r\nworld?\" said Minna, with some degree of awe.\r\n\r\nCleveland composed his countenance, and replied,--\"A short while before\r\nmy father's death, I came, though then very young, into the command of a\r\nsloop, manned with thirty as desperate fellows as ever handled a musket.\r\nWe cruized for a long while with bad success, taking nothing but\r\nwretched small-craft, which were destined to catch turtle, or otherwise\r\nloaded with coarse and worthless trumpery. I had much ado to prevent my\r\ncomrades from avenging upon the crews of those baubling shallops the\r\ndisappointment which they had occasioned to us. At length, we grew\r\ndesperate, and made a descent on a village, where we were told we should\r\nintercept the mules of a certain Spanish governor, laden with treasure.\r\nWe succeeded in carrying the place; but while I endeavoured to save the\r\ninhabitants from the fury of my followers, the muleteers, with their\r\nprecious cargo, escaped into the neighbouring woods. This filled up the\r\nmeasure of my unpopularity. My people, who had been long discontented,\r\nbecame openly mutinous. I was deposed from my command in solemn council,\r\nand condemned, as having too little luck and too much humanity for the\r\nprofession I had undertaken, to be marooned,[10] as the phrase goes, on\r\none of those little sandy, bushy islets, which are called, in the West\r\nIndies, keys, and which are frequented only by turtle and by sea-fowl.\r\nMany of them are supposed to be haunted(_b_)--some by the demons\r\nworshipped by the old inhabitants--some by Caciques and others, whom the\r\nSpaniards had put to death by torture, to compel them to discover their\r\nhidden treasures, and others by the various spectres in which sailors of\r\nall nations have implicit faith.[11] My place of banishment, called\r\nCoffin-key, about two leagues and a half to the south-east of Bermudas,\r\nwas so infamous as the resort of these supernatural inhabitants, that I\r\nbelieve the wealth of Mexico would not have persuaded the bravest of the\r\nscoundrels who put me ashore there, to have spent an hour on the islet\r\nalone, even in broad daylight; and when they rowed off, they pulled for\r\nthe sloop like men that dared not cast their eyes behind them. And there\r\nthey left me, to subsist as I might, on a speck of unproductive sand,\r\nsurrounded by the boundless Atlantic, and haunted, as they supposed, by\r\nmalignant demons.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what was the consequence?\" said Minna, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"I supported life,\" said the adventurer, \"at the expense of such\r\nsea-fowl, aptly called boobies, as were silly enough to let me approach\r\nso near as to knock them down with a stick; and by means of turtle-eggs,\r\nwhen these complaisant birds became better acquainted with the\r\nmischievous disposition of the human species, and more shy of course of\r\nmy advances.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the demons of whom you spoke?\"--continued Minna.\r\n\r\n\"I had my secret apprehensions upon their account,\" said Cleveland: \"In\r\nopen daylight, or in absolute darkness, I did not greatly apprehend\r\ntheir approach; but in the misty dawn of the morning, or when evening\r\nwas about to fall, I saw, for the first week of my abode on the key,\r\nmany a dim and undefined spectre, now resembling a Spaniard, with his\r\ncapa wrapped around him, and his huge sombrero, as large as an umbrella,\r\nupon his head,--now a Dutch sailor, with his rough cap and\r\ntrunk-hose,--and now an Indian Cacique, with his feathery crown and long\r\nlance of cane.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you not approach and address them?\" said Minna.\r\n\r\n\"I always approached them,\" replied the seaman; \"but,--I grieve to\r\ndisappoint your expectations, my fair friend,--whenever I drew near\r\nthem, the phantom changed into a bush, or a piece of drift-wood, or a\r\nwreath of mist, or some such cause of deception, until at last I was\r\ntaught by experience to cheat myself no longer with such visions, and\r\ncontinued a solitary inhabitant of Coffin-key, as little alarmed by\r\nvisionary terrors, as I ever was in the great cabin of a stout vessel,\r\nwith a score of companions around me.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have cheated me into listening to a tale of nothing,\" said Minna;\r\n\"but how long did you continue on the island?\"\r\n\r\n\"Four weeks of wretched existence,\" said Cleveland, \"when I was relieved\r\nby the crew of a vessel which came thither a-turtling. Yet my miserable\r\nseclusion was not entirely useless to me; for on that spot of barren\r\nsand I found, or rather forged, the iron mask, which has since been my\r\nchief security against treason, or mutiny of my followers. It was there\r\nI formed the resolution to seem no softer hearted, nor better\r\ninstructed--no more humane, and no more scrupulous, than those with whom\r\nfortune had leagued me. I thought over my former story, and saw that\r\nseeming more brave, skilful, and enterprising than others, had gained me\r\ncommand and respect, and that seeming more gently nurtured, and more\r\ncivilized than they, had made them envy and hate me as a being of\r\nanother species. I bargained with myself, then, that since I could not\r\nlay aside my superiority of intellect and education, I would do my best\r\nto disguise, and to sink in the rude seaman, all appearance of better\r\nfeeling and better accomplishments. I foresaw then what has since\r\nhappened, that, under the appearance of daring obduracy, I should\r\nacquire such a habitual command over my followers, that I might use it\r\nfor the insurance of discipline, and for relieving the distresses of the\r\nwretches who fell under our power. I saw, in short, that to attain\r\nauthority, I must assume the external semblance, at least, of those over\r\nwhom it was to be exercised. The tidings of my father's fate, while it\r\nexcited me to wrath and to revenge, confirmed the resolution I had\r\nadopted. He also had fallen a victim to his superiority of mind, morals,\r\nand manners, above those whom he commanded. They were wont to call him\r\nthe Gentleman; and, unquestionably, they thought he waited some\r\nfavourable opportunity to reconcile himself, perhaps at their expense,\r\nto those existing forms of society his habits seemed best to suit with,\r\nand, even therefore, they murdered him. Nature and justice alike called\r\non me for revenge. I was soon at the head of a new body of the\r\nadventurers, who are so numerous in those islands. I sought not after\r\nthose by whom I had been myself marooned, but after the wretches who had\r\nbetrayed my father; and on them I took a revenge so severe, that it was\r\nof itself sufficient to stamp me with the character of that inexorable\r\nferocity which I was desirous to be thought to possess, and which,\r\nperhaps, was gradually creeping on my natural disposition in actual\r\nearnest. My manner, speech, and conduct, seemed so totally changed, that\r\nthose who formerly knew me were disposed to ascribe the alteration to my\r\nintercourse with the demons who haunted the sands of Coffin-key; nay,\r\nthere were some superstitious enough to believe, that I had actually\r\nformed a league with them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tremble to hear the rest!\" said Minna; \"did you not become the\r\nmonster of courage and cruelty whose character you assumed?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I have escaped being so, it is to you, Minna,\" replied Cleveland,\r\n\"that the wonder must be ascribed. It is true, I have always endeavoured\r\nto distinguish myself rather by acts of adventurous valour, than by\r\nschemes of revenge or of plunder, and that at length I could save lives\r\nby a rude jest, and sometimes, by the excess of the measures which I\r\nmyself proposed, could induce those under me to intercede in favour of\r\nprisoners; so that the seeming severity of my character has better\r\nserved the cause of humanity, than had I appeared directly devoted to\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nHe ceased, and, as Minna replied not a word, both remained silent for a\r\nlittle space, when Cleveland again resumed the discourse:--\r\n\r\n\"You are silent,\" he said, \"Miss Troil, and I have injured myself in\r\nyour opinion by the frankness with which I have laid my character before\r\nyou. I may truly say that my natural disposition has been controlled,\r\nbut not altered, by the untoward circumstances in which I am placed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am uncertain,\" said Minna, after a moment's consideration, \"whether\r\nyou had been thus candid, had you not known I should soon see your\r\ncomrades, and discover, from their conversation and their manners, what\r\nyou would otherwise gladly have concealed.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do me injustice, Minna, cruel injustice. From the instant that you\r\nknew me to be a sailor of fortune, an adventurer, a buccanier, or, if\r\nyou will have the broad word, a PIRATE, what had you to expect less than\r\nwhat I have told you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak too truly,\" said Minna--\"all this I might have anticipated,\r\nand I know not how I should have expected it otherwise. But it seemed to\r\nme that a war on the cruel and superstitious Spaniards had in it\r\nsomething ennobling--something that refined the fierce employment to\r\nwhich you have just now given its true and dreaded name. I thought that\r\nthe independent warriors of the Western Ocean, raised up, as it were, to\r\npunish the wrongs of so many murdered and plundered tribes must have\r\nhad something of gallant elevation, like that of the Sons of the North,\r\nwhose long galleys avenged on so many coasts the oppressions of\r\ndegenerate Rome. This I thought, and this I dreamed--I grieve that I am\r\nawakened and undeceived. Yet I blame you not for the erring of my own\r\nfancy.--Farewell; we must now part.\"\r\n\r\n\"Say at least,\" said Cleveland, \"that you do not hold me in horror for\r\nhaving told you the truth.\"\r\n\r\n\"I must have time for reflection,\" said Minna, \"time to weigh what you\r\nhave said, ere I can fully understand my own feelings. Thus much,\r\nhowever, I can say even now, that he who pursues the wicked purpose of\r\nplunder, by means of blood and cruelty, and who must veil his remains of\r\nnatural remorse under an affectation of superior profligacy, is not, and\r\ncannot be, the lover whom Minna Troil expected to find in Cleveland; and\r\nif she still love him, it must be as a penitent, and not as a hero.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, she extricated herself from his grasp, (for he still\r\nendeavoured to detain her,) making an imperative sign to him to forbear\r\nfrom following her.--\"She is gone,\" said Cleveland, looking after her;\r\n\"wild and fanciful as she is, I expected not this.--She startled not at\r\nthe name of my perilous course of life, yet seems totally unprepared for\r\nthe evil which must necessarily attend it; and so all the merit I have\r\ngained by my resemblance to a Norse Champion, or King of the Sea, is to\r\nbe lost at once, because a gang of pirates do not prove to be a choir of\r\nsaints. I would that Rackam, Hawkins, and the rest, had been at the\r\nbottom of the Race of Portland--I would the Pentland Frith had swept\r\nthem to hell rather than to Orkney! I will not, however, quit the chase\r\nof this angel for all that these fiends can do. I will--I must to Orkney\r\nbefore the Udaller makes his voyage thither--our meeting might alarm\r\neven his blunt understanding, although, thank Heaven, in this wild\r\ncountry, men know the nature of our trade only by hearsay, through our\r\nhonest friends the Dutch, who take care never to speak very ill of those\r\nthey make money by.--Well, if fortune would but stand my friend with\r\nthis beautiful enthusiast, I would pursue her wheel no farther at sea,\r\nbut set myself down amongst these rocks, as happy as if they were so\r\nmany groves of bananas and palmettoes.\"\r\n\r\nWith these, and such thoughts, half rolling in his bosom, half expressed\r\nin indistinct hints and murmurs, the pirate Cleveland returned to the\r\nmansion of Burgh-Westra.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[8] Dr. Edmonston, the ingenious author of a View of the Ancient and\r\nPresent State of the Zetland Islands, has placed this part of the\r\nsubject in an interesting light. \"It is truly painful to witness the\r\nanxiety and distress which the wives of these poor men suffer on the\r\napproach of a storm. Regardless of fatigue, they leave their homes, and\r\nfly to the spot where they expect their husbands to land, or ascend the\r\nsummit of a rock, to look out for them on the bosom of the deep. Should\r\nthey get the glimpse of a sail, they watch, with trembling solicitude,\r\nits alternate rise and disappearance on the waves; and though often\r\ntranquillized by the safe arrival of the objects of their search, yet it\r\nsometimes is their lot 'to hail the bark that never can return.' Subject\r\nto the influence of a variable climate, and engaged on a sea naturally\r\ntempestuous, with rapid currents, scarcely a season passes over without\r\nthe occurrence of some fatal accident or hairbreadth escape.\"--_View,\r\n&c. of the Zetland Islands_, vol. i. p. 238. Many interesting\r\nparticulars respecting the fisheries and agriculture of Zetland, as well\r\nas its antiquities, may be found in the work we have quoted.\r\n\r\n[9] Note II.--Promise of Odin.\r\n\r\n[10] To _maroon_ a seaman, signified to abandon him on a desolate coast\r\nor island--a piece of cruelty often practised by Pirates and Buccaniers.\r\n\r\n[11] An elder brother, now no more, who was educated in the navy, and\r\nhad been a midshipman in Rodney's squadron in the West Indies, used to\r\nastonish the author's boyhood with tales of those haunted islets. On one\r\nof them, called, I believe, Coffin-key, the seamen positively refused to\r\npass the night, and came off every evening while they were engaged in\r\ncompleting the watering of the vessel, returning the following sunrise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n  There was shaking of hands, and sorrow of heart,\r\n  For the hour was approaching when merry folks must part;\r\n  So we call'd for our horses, and ask'd for our way,\r\n  While the jolly old landlord said, \"Nothing's to pay.\"\r\n\r\n                                         _Lilliput, a Poem._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe do not dwell upon the festivities of the day, which had nothing in\r\nthem to interest the reader particularly. The table groaned under the\r\nusual plenty, which was disposed of by the guests with the usual\r\nappetite--the bowl of punch was filled and emptied with the same\r\ncelerity as usual--the men quaffed, and the women laughed--Claud Halcro\r\nrhymed, punned, and praised John Dryden--the Udaller bumpered and sung\r\nchoruses--and the evening concluded, as usual, in the Rigging-loft, as\r\nit was Magnus Troil's pleasure to term the dancing apartment.\r\n\r\nIt was then and there that Cleveland, approaching Magnus, where he sat\r\nbetwixt his two daughters, intimated his intention of going to Kirkwall\r\nin a small brig, which Bryce Snailsfoot, who had disposed of his goods\r\nwith unprecedented celerity, had freighted thither, to procure a supply.\r\n\r\nMagnus heard the sudden proposal of his guest with surprise, not\r\nunmingled with displeasure, and demanded sharply of Cleveland, how long\r\nit was since he had learned to prefer Bryce Snailsfoot's company to his\r\nown? Cleveland answered, with his usual bluntness of manner, that time\r\nand tide tarried for no one, and that he had his own particular reasons\r\nfor making his trip to Kirkwall sooner than the Udaller proposed to set\r\nsail--that he hoped to meet with him and his daughters at the great fair\r\nwhich was now closely approaching, and might perhaps find it possible to\r\nreturn to Zetland along with them.\r\n\r\nWhile he spoke this, Brenda kept her eye as much upon her sister as it\r\nwas possible to do, without exciting general observation. She remarked,\r\nthat Minna's pale cheek became yet paler while Cleveland spoke, and that\r\nshe seemed, by compressing her lips, and slightly knitting her brows, to\r\nbe in the act of repressing the effects of strong interior emotion. But\r\nshe spoke not; and when Cleveland, having bidden adieu to the Udaller,\r\napproached to salute her, as was then the custom, she received his\r\nfarewell without trusting herself to attempt a reply.\r\n\r\nBrenda had her own trial approaching; for Mordaunt Mertoun, once so much\r\nloved by her father, was now in the act of making his cold parting from\r\nhim, without receiving a single look of friendly regard. There was,\r\nindeed, sarcasm in the tone with which Magnus wished the youth a good\r\njourney, and recommended to him, if he met a bonny lass by the way, not\r\nto dream that she was in love, because she chanced to jest with him.\r\nMertoun coloured at what he felt as an insult, though it was but half\r\nintelligible to him; but he remembered Brenda, and suppressed every\r\nfeeling of resentment. He proceeded to take his leave of the sisters.\r\nMinna, whose heart was considerably softened towards him, received his\r\nfarewell with some degree of interest; but Brenda's grief was so visible\r\nin the kindness of her manner, and the moisture which gathered in her\r\neye, that it was noticed even by the Udaller, who exclaimed, half\r\nangrily, \"Why, ay, lass, that may be right enough, for he was an old\r\nacquaintance; but mind! I have no will that he remain one.\"\r\n\r\nMertoun, who was slowly leaving the apartment, half overheard this\r\ndisparaging observation, and half turned round to resent it. But his\r\npurpose failed him when he saw that Brenda had been obliged to have\r\nrecourse to her handkerchief to hide her emotion, and the sense that it\r\nwas excited by his departure, obliterated every thought of her father's\r\nunkindness. He retired--the other guests followed his example; and many\r\nof them, like Cleveland and himself, took their leave over-night, with\r\nthe intention of commencing their homeward journey on the succeeding\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nThat night, the mutual sorrow of Minna and Brenda, if it could not\r\nwholly remove the reserve which had estranged the sisters from each\r\nother, at least melted all its frozen and unkindly symptoms. They wept\r\nin each other's arms; and though neither spoke, yet each became dearer\r\nto the other; because they felt that the grief which called forth these\r\ndrops, had a source common to them both.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, that though Brenda's tears were most abundant, the grief\r\nof Minna was most deeply seated; for, long after the younger had sobbed\r\nherself asleep, like a child, upon her sister's bosom, Minna lay awake,\r\nwatching the dubious twilight, while tear after tear slowly gathered in\r\nher eye, and found a current down her cheek, as soon as it became too\r\nheavy to be supported by her long black silken eyelashes. As she lay,\r\nbewildered among the sorrowful thoughts which supplied these tears, she\r\nwas surprised to distinguish, beneath the window, the sounds of music.\r\nAt first she supposed it was some freak of Claud Halcro, whose fantastic\r\nhumour sometimes indulged itself in such serenades. But it was not the\r\n_gue_ of the old minstrel, but the guitar, that she heard; an instrument\r\nwhich none in the island knew how to touch except Cleveland, who had\r\nlearned, in his intercourse with the South-American Spaniards, to play\r\non it with superior execution. Perhaps it was in those climates also\r\nthat he had learned the song, which, though he now sung it under the\r\nwindow of a maiden of Thule, had certainly never been composed for the\r\nnative of a climate so northerly and so severe, since it spoke of\r\nproductions of the earth and skies which are there unknown.\r\n\r\n1.\r\n\r\n        \"Love wakes and weeps\r\n        While Beauty sleeps:\r\n  O for Music's softest numbers,\r\n        To prompt a theme,\r\n        For Beauty's dream,\r\n  Soft as the pillow of her slumbers!\r\n\r\n2.\r\n\r\n        \"Through groves of palm\r\n        Sigh gales of balm,\r\n  Fire-flies on the air are wheeling;\r\n        While through the gloom\r\n        Comes soft perfume,\r\n  The distant beds of flowers revealing.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.\r\n\r\n        \"O wake and live,\r\n        No dream can give\r\n  A shadow'd bliss, the real excelling;\r\n        No longer sleep,\r\n        From lattice peep,\r\n  And list the tale that Love is telling!\"\r\n\r\nThe voice of Cleveland was deep, rich, and manly, and accorded well with\r\nthe Spanish air, to which the words, probably a translation from the\r\nsame language, had been adapted. His invocation would not probably have\r\nbeen fruitless, could Minna have arisen without awaking her sister. But\r\nthat was impossible; for Brenda, who, as we have already mentioned, had\r\nwept bitterly before she had sunk into repose, now lay with her face on\r\nher sister's neck, and one arm stretched around her, in the attitude of\r\na child which has cried itself asleep in the arms of its nurse. It was\r\nimpossible for Minna to extricate herself from her grasp without awaking\r\nher; and she could not, therefore, execute her hasty purpose, of donning\r\nher gown, and approaching the window to speak with Cleveland, who, she\r\nhad no doubt, had resorted to this contrivance to procure an interview.\r\nThe restraint was sufficiently provoking, for it was more than probable\r\nthat her lover came to take his last farewell; but that Brenda, inimical\r\nas she seemed to be of late towards Cleveland, should awake and witness\r\nit, was a thought not to be endured.\r\n\r\nThere was a short pause, in which Minna endeavoured more than once, with\r\nas much gentleness as possible, to unclasp Brenda's arm from her neck;\r\nbut whenever she attempted it, the slumberer muttered some little\r\npettish sound, like a child disturbed in its sleep, which sufficiently\r\nshowed that perseverance in the attempt would awaken her fully.\r\n\r\nTo her great vexation, therefore, Minna was compelled to remain still\r\nand silent; when her lover, as if determined upon gaining her ear by\r\nmusic of another strain, sung the following fragment of a sea-ditty:--\r\n\r\n  \"Farewell! Farewell! the voice you hear,\r\n    Has left its last soft tone with you,--\r\n  Its next must join the seaward cheer,\r\n    And shout among the shouting crew.\r\n\r\n  \"The accents which I scarce could form\r\n    Beneath your frown's controlling check,\r\n  Must give the word, above the storm,\r\n    To cut the mast, and clear the wreck.\r\n\r\n  \"The timid eye I dared not raise,--\r\n    The hand that shook when press'd to thine,\r\n  Must point the guns upon the chase,--\r\n    Must bid the deadly cutlass shine.\r\n\r\n  \"To all I love, or hope, or fear,--\r\n    Honour, or own, a long adieu!\r\n  To all that life has soft and dear,\r\n    Farewell! save memory of you!\"[12](_c_)\r\n\r\nHe was again silent; and again she, to whom the serenade was addressed,\r\nstrove in vain to arise without rousing her sister. It was impossible;\r\nand she had nothing before her but the unhappy thought that Cleveland\r\nwas taking leave in his desolation, without a single glance, or a single\r\nword. He, too, whose temper was so fiery, yet who subjected his violent\r\nmood with such sedulous attention to her will--could she but have stolen\r\na moment to say adieu--to caution him against new quarrels with\r\nMertoun--to implore him to detach himself from such comrades as he had\r\ndescribed--could she but have done this, who could say what effect such\r\nparting admonitions might have had upon his character--nay, upon the\r\nfuture events of his life?\r\n\r\nTantalized by such thoughts, Minna was about to make another and\r\ndecisive effort, when she heard voices beneath the window, and thought\r\nshe could distinguish that they were those of Cleveland and Mertoun,\r\nspeaking in a sharp tone, which, at the same time, seemed cautiously\r\nsuppressed, as if the speakers feared being overheard. Alarm now mingled\r\nwith her former desire to rise from bed, and she accomplished at once\r\nthe purpose which she had so often attempted in vain. Brenda's arm was\r\nunloosed from her sister's neck, without the sleeper receiving more\r\nalarm than provoked two or three unintelligible murmurs; while, with\r\nequal speed and silence, Minna put on some part of her dress, with the\r\nintention to steal to the window. But, ere she could accomplish this,\r\nthe sound of the voices without was exchanged for that of blows and\r\nstruggling, which terminated suddenly by a deep groan.\r\n\r\nTerrified at this last signal of mischief, Minna sprung to the window,\r\nand endeavoured to open it, for the persons were so close under the\r\nwalls of the house that she could not see them, save by putting her head\r\nout of the casement. The iron hasp was stiff and rusted, and, as\r\ngenerally happens, the haste with which she laboured to undo it only\r\nrendered the task more difficult. When it was accomplished, and Minna\r\nhad eagerly thrust her body half out at the casement, those who had\r\ncreated the sounds which alarmed her were become invisible, excepting\r\nthat she saw a shadow cross the moonlight, the substance of which must\r\nhave been in the act of turning a corner, which concealed it from her\r\nsight. The shadow moved slowly, and seemed that of a man who supported\r\nanother upon his shoulders; an indication which put the climax to\r\nMinna's agony of mind. The window was not above eight feet from the\r\nground, and she hesitated not to throw herself from it hastily, and to\r\npursue the object which had excited her terror.\r\n\r\nBut when she came to the corner of the buildings from which the shadow\r\nseemed to have been projected, she discovered nothing which could point\r\nout the way that the figure had gone; and, after a moment's\r\nconsideration, became sensible that all attempts at pursuit would be\r\nalike wild and fruitless. Besides all the projections and recesses of\r\nthe many-angled mansion, and its numerous offices--besides the various\r\ncellars, store-houses, stables, and so forth, which defied her solitary\r\nsearch, there was a range of low rocks, stretching down to the haven,\r\nand which were, in fact, a continuation of the ridge which formed its\r\npier. These rocks had many indentures, hollows, and caverns, into any\r\none of which the figure to which the shadow belonged might have retired\r\nwith his fatal burden; for fatal, she feared, it was most likely to\r\nprove.\r\n\r\nA moment's reflection, as we have said, convinced Minna of the folly of\r\nfurther pursuit. Her next thought was to alarm the family; but what tale\r\nhad she to tell, and of whom was that tale to be told?--On the other\r\nhand, the wounded man--if indeed he were wounded--alas, if indeed he\r\nwere not mortally wounded!--might not be past the reach of assistance;\r\nand, with this idea, she was about to raise her voice, when she was\r\ninterrupted by that of Claud Halcro, who was returning apparently from\r\nthe haven, and singing, in his manner, a scrap of an old Norse ditty,\r\nwhich might run thus in English:--\r\n\r\n  \"And you shall deal the funeral dole;\r\n    Ay, deal it, mother mine,\r\n  To weary body, and to heavy soul,\r\n    The white bread and the wine.\r\n\r\n  \"And you shall deal my horses of pride;\r\n    Ay, deal them, mother mine;\r\n  And you shall deal my lands so wide,\r\n    And deal my castles nine.\r\n\r\n  \"But deal not vengeance for the deed,\r\n    And deal not for the crime;\r\n  The body to its place, and the soul to Heaven's grace,\r\n    And the rest in God's own time.\"\r\n\r\nThe singular adaptation of these rhymes to the situation in which she\r\nfound herself, seemed to Minna like a warning from Heaven. We are\r\nspeaking of a land of omens and superstitions, and perhaps will scarce\r\nbe understood by those whose limited imagination cannot conceive how\r\nstrongly these operate upon the human mind during a certain progress of\r\nsociety. A line of Virgil, turned up casually, was received in the\r\nseventeenth century, and in the court of England,[13] as an intimation\r\nof future events; and no wonder that a maiden of the distant and wild\r\nisles of Zetland should have considered as an injunction from Heaven,\r\nverses which happened to convey a sense analogous to her present\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\n\"I will be silent,\" she muttered,--\"I will seal my lips--\r\n\r\n  'The body to its place, and the soul to Heaven's grace,\r\n  And the rest in God's own time.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Who speaks there?\" said Claud Halcro, in some alarm; for he had not, in\r\nhis travels in foreign parts, been able by any means to rid himself of\r\nhis native superstitions. In the condition to which fear and horror had\r\nreduced her, Minna was at first unable to reply; and Halcro, fixing his\r\neyes upon the female white figure, which he saw indistinctly, (for she\r\nstood in the shadow of the house, and the morning was thick and misty,)\r\nbegan to conjure her in an ancient rhyme which occurred to him as suited\r\nfor the occasion, and which had in its gibberish a wild and unearthly\r\nsound, which may be lost in the ensuing translation:--\r\n\r\n  \"Saint Magnus control thee, that martyr of treason;\r\n  Saint Ronan rebuke thee, with rhyme and with reason;\r\n  By the mass of Saint Martin, the might of Saint Mary,\r\n  Be thou gone, or thy weird shall be worse if thou tarry!\r\n    If of good, go hence and hallow thee,--\r\n    If of ill, let the earth swallow thee,--\r\n    If thou'rt of air, let the grey mist fold thee,--\r\n    If of earth, let the swart mine hold thee,--\r\n    If a Pixie, seek thy ring,--\r\n    If a Nixie, seek thy spring;--\r\n    If on middle earth thou'st been\r\n    Slave of sorrow, shame, and sin,\r\n    Hast eat the bread of toil and strife,\r\n    And dree'd the lot which men call life,\r\n  Begone to thy stone! for thy coffin is scant of thee,\r\n  The worm, thy playfellow, wails for the want of thee;--\r\n  Hence, houseless ghost! let the earth hide thee,\r\n  Till Michael shall blow the blast, see that there thou bide thee!--\r\n  Phantom, fly hence! take the Cross for a token,\r\n  Hence pass till Hallowmass!--my spell is spoken.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is I, Halcro,\" muttered Minna, in a tone so thin and low, that it\r\nmight have passed for the faint reply of the conjured phantom.\r\n\r\n\"You!--you!\" said Halcro, his tone of alarm changing to one of extreme\r\nsurprise; \"by this moonlight, which is waning, and so it is!--Who could\r\nhave thought to find you, my most lovely Night, wandering abroad in your\r\nown element!--But you saw them, I reckon, as well as I?--bold enough in\r\nyou to follow them, though.\"\r\n\r\n\"Saw whom?--follow whom?\" said Minna, hoping to gain some information on\r\nthe subject of her fears and anxiety.\r\n\r\n\"The corpse-lights which danced at the haven,\" replied Halcro; \"they\r\nbode no good, I promise you--you wot well what the old rhyme says--\r\n\r\n  'Where corpse-light\r\n  Dances bright,\r\n  Be it day or night,\r\n  Be it by light or dark,\r\n  There shall corpse lie stiff and stark.'\r\n\r\nI went half as far as the haven to look after them, but they had\r\nvanished. I think I saw a boat put off, however,--some one bound for the\r\nHaaf, I suppose.--I would we had good news of this fishing--there was\r\nNorna left us in anger,--and then these corpse-lights!--Well, God help\r\nthe while! I am an old man, and can but wish that all were well\r\nover.--But how now, my pretty Minna? tears in your eyes!--And now that I\r\nsee you in the fair moonlight, barefooted, too, by Saint Magnus!--Were\r\nthere no stockings of Zetland wool soft enough for these pretty feet and\r\nankles, that glance so white in the moonbeam?--What, silent!--angry,\r\nperhaps,\" he added, in a more serious tone, \"at my nonsense? For shame,\r\nsilly maiden!--Remember I am old enough to be your father, and have\r\nalways loved you as my child.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am not angry,\" said Minna, constraining herself to speak--\"but heard\r\nyou nothing?--saw you nothing?--They must have passed you.\"\r\n\r\n\"They?\" said Claud Halcro; \"what mean you by they?--is it the\r\ncorpse-lights?--No, they did not pass by me, but I think they have\r\npassed by you, and blighted you with their influence, for you are as\r\npale as a spectre.--Come, come, Minna,\" he added, opening a side-door of\r\nthe dwelling, \"these moonlight walks are fitter for old poets than for\r\nyoung maidens--And so lightly clad as you are! Maiden, you should take\r\ncare how you give yourself to the breezes of a Zetland night, for they\r\nbring more sleet than odours upon their wings.--But, maiden, go in; for,\r\nas glorious John says--or, as he does not say--for I cannot remember how\r\nhis verse chimes--but, as I say myself, in a pretty poem, written when\r\nmy muse was in her teens,--\r\n\r\n  Menseful maiden ne'er should rise,\r\n  Till the first beam tinge the skies;\r\n  Silk-fringed eyelids still should close,\r\n  Till the sun has kiss'd the rose;\r\n  Maiden's foot we should not view,\r\n  Mark'd with tiny print on dew,\r\n  Till the opening flowerets spread\r\n  Carpet meet for beauty's tread--\r\n\r\nStay, what comes next?--let me see.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the spirit of recitation seized on Claud Halcro, he forgot time and\r\nplace, and might have kept his companion in the cold air for half an\r\nhour, giving poetical reasons why she ought to have been in bed. But she\r\ninterrupted him by the question, earnestly pronounced, yet in a voice\r\nwhich was scarcely articulate, holding Halcro, at the same time, with a\r\ntrembling and convulsive grasp, as if to support herself from\r\nfalling,--\"Saw you no one in the boat which put to sea but now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense,\" replied Halcro; \"how could I see any one, when light and\r\ndistance only enabled me to know that it was a boat, and not a grampus?\"\r\n\r\n\"But there must have been some one in the boat?\" repeated Minna, scarce\r\nconscious of what she said.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" answered the poet; \"boats seldom work to windward of their\r\nown accord.--But come, this is all folly; and so, as the Queen says, in\r\nan old play, which was revived for the stage by rare Will D'Avenant, 'To\r\nbed--to bed--to bed!'\"\r\n\r\nThey separated, and Minna's limbs conveyed her with difficulty, through\r\nseveral devious passages, to her own chamber, where she stretched\r\nherself cautiously beside her still sleeping sister, with a mind\r\nharassed with the most agonizing apprehensions. That she had heard\r\nCleveland, she was positive--the tenor of the songs left her no doubt on\r\nthat subject. If not equally certain that she had heard young Mertoun's\r\nvoice in hot quarrel with her lover, the impression to that effect was\r\nstrong on her mind. The groan, with which the struggle seemed to\r\nterminate--the fearful indication from which it seemed that the\r\nconqueror had borne off the lifeless body of his victim--all tended to\r\nprove that some fatal event had concluded the contest. And which of the\r\nunhappy men had fallen?--which had met a bloody death?--which had\r\nachieved a fatal and a bloody victory?--These were questions to which\r\nthe still small voice of interior conviction answered, that her lover\r\nCleveland, from character, temper, and habits, was most likely to have\r\nbeen the survivor of the fray. She received from the reflection an\r\ninvoluntary consolation which she almost detested herself for admitting,\r\nwhen she recollected that it was at once darkened with her lover's\r\nguilt, and embittered with the destruction of Brenda's happiness for\r\never.\r\n\r\n\"Innocent, unhappy sister!\" such were her reflections; \"thou that art\r\nten times better than I, because so unpretending--so unassuming in thine\r\nexcellence! How is it possible that I should cease to feel a pang, which\r\nis only transferred from my bosom to thine?\"\r\n\r\nAs these cruel thoughts crossed her mind, she could not refrain from\r\nstraining her sister so close to her bosom, that, after a heavy sigh,\r\nBrenda awoke.\r\n\r\n\"Sister,\" she said, \"is it you?--I dreamed I lay on one of those\r\nmonuments which Claud Halcro described to us, where the effigy of the\r\ninhabitant beneath lies carved in stone upon the sepulchre. I dreamed\r\nsuch a marble form lay by my side, and that it suddenly acquired enough\r\nof life and animation to fold me to its cold, moist bosom--and it is\r\nyours, Minna, that is indeed so chilly.--You are ill, my dearest Minna!\r\nfor God's sake, let me rise and call Euphane Fea.--What ails you? has\r\nNorna been here again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Call no one hither,\" said Minna, detaining her; \"nothing ails me for\r\nwhich any one has a remedy--nothing but apprehensions of evil worse than\r\neven Norna could prophesy. But God is above all, my dear Brenda; and let\r\nus pray to him to turn, as he only can, our evil into good.\"\r\n\r\nThey did jointly repeat their usual prayer for strength and protection\r\nfrom on high, and again composed themselves to sleep, suffering no word\r\nsave \"God bless you,\" to pass betwixt them, when their devotions were\r\nfinished; thus scrupulously dedicating to Heaven their last waking\r\nwords, if human frailty prevented them from commanding their last waking\r\nthoughts. Brenda slept first, and Minna, strongly resisting the dark and\r\nevil presentiments which again began to crowd themselves upon her\r\nimagination, was at last so fortunate as to slumber also.\r\n\r\nThe storm which Halcro had expected began about daybreak,--a squall,\r\nheavy with wind and rain, such as is often felt, even during the finest\r\npart of the season, in these latitudes. At the whistle of the wind, and\r\nthe clatter of the rain on the shingle-roofing of the fishers' huts,\r\nmany a poor woman was awakened, and called on her children to hold up\r\ntheir little hands, and join in prayer for the safety of the dear\r\nhusband and father, who was even then at the mercy of the disturbed\r\nelements. Around the house of Burgh-Westra, chimneys howled, and windows\r\nclashed. The props and rafters of the higher parts of the building, most\r\nof them formed out of wreck-wood, groaned and quivered, as fearing to be\r\nagain dispersed by the tempest. But the daughters of Magnus Troil\r\ncontinued to sleep as softly and as sweetly as if the hand of Chantrey\r\nhad formed them out of statuary-marble. The squall had passed away, and\r\nthe sunbeams, dispersing the clouds which drifted to leeward, shone full\r\nthrough the lattice, when Minna first started from the profound sleep\r\ninto which fatigue and mental exhaustion had lulled her, and, raising\r\nherself on her arm, began to recall events, which, after this interval\r\nof profound repose, seemed almost to resemble the baseless visions of\r\nthe night. She almost doubted if what she recalled of horror, previous\r\nto her starting from her bed, was not indeed the fiction of a dream,\r\nsuggested, perhaps, by some external sounds.\r\n\r\n\"I will see Claud Halcro instantly,\" she said; \"he may know something of\r\nthese strange noises, as he was stirring at the time.\"\r\n\r\nWith that she sprung from bed, but hardly stood upright on the floor,\r\nere her sister exclaimed, \"Gracious Heaven! Minna, what ails your\r\nfoot--your ankle?\"\r\n\r\nShe looked down, and saw with surprise, which amounted to agony, that\r\nboth her feet, but particularly one of them, was stained with dark\r\ncrimson, resembling the colour of dried blood.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to answer Brenda, she rushed to the window, and cast\r\na desperate look on the grass beneath, for there she knew she must have\r\ncontracted the fatal stain. But the rain, which had fallen there in\r\ntreble quantity, as well from the heavens, as from the eaves of the\r\nhouse, had washed away that guilty witness, if indeed such had ever\r\nexisted. All was fresh and fair, and the blades of grass, overcharged\r\nand bent with rain-drops, glittered like diamonds in the bright morning\r\nsun.\r\n\r\nWhile Minna stared upon the spangled verdure, with her full dark eyes\r\nfixed and enlarged to circles by the intensity of her terror, Brenda was\r\nhanging about her, and with many an eager enquiry, pressed to know\r\nwhether or how she had hurt herself?\r\n\r\n\"A piece of glass cut through my shoe,\" said Minna, bethinking herself\r\nthat some excuse was necessary to her sister; \"I scarce felt it at the\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet see how it has bled,\" said her sister. \"Sweet Minna,\" she\r\nadded, approaching her with a wetted towel, \"let me wipe the blood\r\noff--the hurt may be worse than you think of.\"\r\n\r\nBut as she approached, Minna, who saw no other way of preventing\r\ndiscovery that the blood with which she was stained had never flowed in\r\nher own veins, harshly and hastily repelled the proffered kindness. Poor\r\nBrenda, unconscious of any offence which she had given to her sister,\r\ndrew back two or three paces on finding her service thus unkindly\r\nrefused, and stood gazing at Minna with looks in which there was more of\r\nsurprise and mortified affection than of resentment, but which had yet\r\nsomething also of natural displeasure.\r\n\r\n\"Sister,\" said she, \"I thought we had agreed but last night, that,\r\nhappen to us what might, we would at least love each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Much may happen betwixt night and morning!\" answered Minna, in words\r\nrather wrenched from her by her situation, than flowing forth the\r\nvoluntary interpreters of her thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"Much may indeed have happened in a night so stormy,\" answered Brenda;\r\n\"for see where the very wall around Euphane's plant-a-cruive has been\r\nblown down; but neither wind nor rain, nor aught else, can cool our\r\naffection, Minna.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that may chance,\" replied Minna, \"which may convert it into\"----\r\n\r\nThe rest of the sentence she muttered in a tone so indistinct, that it\r\ncould not be apprehended; while, at the same time, she washed the\r\nblood-stains from her feet and left ankle. Brenda, who still remained\r\nlooking on at some distance, endeavoured in vain to assume some tone\r\nwhich might re-establish kindness and confidence betwixt them.\r\n\r\n\"You were right,\" she said, \"Minna, to suffer no one to help you to\r\ndress so simple a scratch--standing where I do, it is scarce visible.\"\r\n\r\n\"The most cruel wounds,\" replied Minna, \"are those which make no outward\r\nshow--Are you sure you see it at all?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, yes!\" replied Brenda, framing her answer as she thought would best\r\nplease her sister; \"I see a very slight scratch; nay, now you draw on\r\nthe stocking, I can see nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do indeed see nothing,\" answered Minna, somewhat wildly; \"but the\r\ntime will soon come that all--ay, all--will be seen and known.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, she hastily completed her dress, and led the way to\r\nbreakfast, where she assumed her place amongst the guests; but with a\r\ncountenance so pale and haggard, and manners and speech so altered and\r\nso bewildered, that it excited the attention of the whole company, and\r\nthe utmost anxiety on the part of her father Magnus Troil. Many and\r\nvarious were the conjectures of the guests, concerning a distemperature\r\nwhich seemed rather mental than corporeal. Some hinted that the maiden\r\nhad been struck with an evil eye, and something they muttered about\r\nNorna of the Fitful-head; some talked of the departure of Captain\r\nCleveland, and murmured, \"it was a shame for a young lady to take on so\r\nafter a landlouper, of whom no one knew any thing;\" and this\r\ncontemptuous epithet was in particular bestowed on the Captain by\r\nMistress Baby Yellowley, while she was in the act of wrapping round her\r\nold skinny neck the very handsome owerlay (as she called it) wherewith\r\nthe said Captain had presented her. The old Lady Glowrowrum had a system\r\nof her own, which she hinted to Mistress Yellowley, after thanking God\r\nthat her own connexion with the Burgh-Westra family was by the lass's\r\nmother, who was a canny Scotswoman, like herself.\r\n\r\n\"For, as to these Troils, you see, Dame Yellowley, for as high as they\r\nhold their heads, they say that ken,\" (winking sagaciously,) \"that there\r\nis a bee in their bonnet;--that Norna, as they call her, for it's not\r\nher right name neither, is at whiles far beside her right mind,--and\r\nthey that ken the cause, say the Fowd was some gate or other linked in\r\nwith it, for he will never hear an ill word of her. But I was in\r\nScotland then, or I might have kend the real cause, as weel as other\r\nfolk. At ony rate there is a kind of wildness in the blood. Ye ken very\r\nweel daft folk dinna bide to be contradicted; and I'll say that for the\r\nFowd--he likes to be contradicted as ill as ony man in Zetland. But it\r\nshall never be said that I said ony ill of the house that I am sae\r\nnearly connected wi'. Only ye will mind, dame, it is through the\r\nSinclairs that we are akin, not through the Troils,--and the Sinclairs\r\nare kend far and wide for a wise generation, dame.--But I see there is\r\nthe stirrup-cup coming round.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" said Mistress Baby to her brother, as soon as the Lady\r\nGlowrowrum turned from her, \"what gars that muckle wife dame, dame,\r\ndame, that gate at me? She might ken the blude of the Clinkscales is as\r\ngude as ony Glowrowrum's amang them.\"\r\n\r\nThe guests, meanwhile, were fast taking their departure, scarcely\r\nnoticed by Magnus, who was so much engrossed with Minna's indisposition,\r\nthat, contrary to his hospitable wont, he suffered them to go away\r\nunsaluted. And thus concluded, amidst anxiety and illness, the festival\r\nof Saint John, as celebrated on that season at the house of\r\nBurgh-Westra; adding another caution to that of the Emperor of\r\nEthiopia,--with how little security man can reckon upon the days which\r\nhe destines to happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] I cannot suppress the pride of saying, that these lines have been\r\nbeautifully set to original music, by Mrs. Arkwright, of Derbyshire.\r\n\r\n[13] The celebrated Sortes Virgilianæ were resorted to by Charles I. and\r\nhis courtiers, as a mode of prying into futurity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n    But this sad evil which doth her infest,\r\n    Doth course of natural cause far exceed,\r\n    And housed is within her hollow breast,\r\n    That either seems some cursed witch's deed,\r\n  Or evill spright that in her doth such torment breed.\r\n\r\n                        _Fairy Queen, Book III., Canto III._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term had now elapsed, by several days, when Mordaunt Mertoun, as he\r\nhad promised at his departure, should have returned to his father's\r\nabode at Jarlshof, but there were no tidings of his arrival. Such delay\r\nmight, at another time, have excited little curiosity, and no anxiety;\r\nfor old Swertha, who took upon her the office of thinking and\r\nconjecturing for the little household, would have concluded that he had\r\nremained behind the other guests upon some party of sport or pleasure.\r\nBut she knew that Mordaunt had not been lately in favour with Magnus\r\nTroil; she knew that he proposed his stay at Burgh-Westra should be a\r\nshort one, upon account of his father's health, to whom, notwithstanding\r\nthe little encouragement which his filial piety received, he paid\r\nuniform attention. Swertha knew all this, and she became anxious. She\r\nwatched the looks of her master, the elder Mertoun; but, wrapt in dark\r\nand stern uniformity of composure, his countenance, like the surface of\r\na midnight lake, enabled no one to penetrate into what was beneath. His\r\nstudies, his solitary meals, his lonely walks, succeeded each other in\r\nunvaried rotation, and seemed undisturbed by the least thought about\r\nMordaunt's absence.\r\n\r\nAt length such reports reached Swertha's ear, from various quarters,\r\nthat she became totally unable to conceal her anxiety, and resolved, at\r\nthe risk of provoking her master into fury, or perhaps that of losing\r\nher place in his household, to force upon his notice the doubts which\r\nafflicted her own mind. Mordaunt's good-humour and goodly person must\r\nindeed have made no small impression on the withered and selfish heart\r\nof the poor old woman, to induce her to take a course so desperate, and\r\nfrom which her friend the Ranzelman endeavoured in vain to deter her.\r\nStill, however, conscious that a miscarriage in the matter, would, like\r\nthe loss of Trinculo's bottle in the horse-pool, be attended not only\r\nwith dishonour, but with infinite loss, she determined to proceed on her\r\nhigh emprize with as much caution as was consistent with the attempt.\r\n\r\nWe have already mentioned, that it seemed a part of the very nature of\r\nthis reserved and unsocial being, at least since his retreat into the\r\nutter solitude of Jarlshof, to endure no one to start a subject of\r\nconversation, or to put any question to him, that did not arise out of\r\nurgent and pressing emergency. Swertha was sensible, therefore, that, in\r\norder to open the discourse favourably which she proposed to hold with\r\nher master, she must contrive that it should originate with himself.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this purpose, while busied in preparing the table for Mr.\r\nMertoun's simple and solitary dinner-meal, she formally adorned the\r\ntable with two covers instead of one, and made all her other\r\npreparations as if he was to have a guest or companion at dinner.\r\n\r\nThe artifice succeeded; for Mertoun, on coming from his study, no sooner\r\nsaw the table thus arranged, than he asked Swertha, who, waiting the\r\neffect of her stratagem as a fisher watches his ground-baits, was\r\nfiddling up and down the room, \"Whether Mordaunt was returned from\r\nBurgh-Westra?\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis question was the cue for Swertha, and she answered in a voice of\r\nsorrowful anxiety, half real, half affected, \"Na, na!--nae sic divot had\r\ndunted at their door. It wad be blithe news indeed, to ken that young\r\nMaister Mordaunt, puir dear bairn, were safe at hame.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if he be not at home, why should you lay a cover for him, you\r\ndoting fool?\" replied Mertoun, in a tone well calculated to stop the old\r\nwoman's proceedings. But she replied, boldly, \"that, indeed, somebody\r\nshould take thought about Maister Mordaunt; a' that she could do was to\r\nhave seat and plate ready for him when he came. But she thought the dear\r\nbairn had been ower lang awa; and, if she maun speak out, she had her\r\nain fears when and whether he might ever come hame.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Your_ fears!\" said Mertoun, his eyes flashing as they usually did when\r\nhis hour of ungovernable passion approached; \"do you speak of your idle\r\nfears to me, who know that all of your sex, that is not fickleness, and\r\nfolly, and self-conceit, and self-will, is a bundle of idiotical fears,\r\nvapours, and tremors? What are your fears to me, you foolish old hag?\"\r\n\r\nIt is an admirable quality in womankind, that, when a breach of the laws\r\nof natural affection comes under their observation, the whole sex is in\r\narms. Let a rumour arise in the street of a parent that has misused a\r\nchild, or a child that has insulted a parent,--I say nothing of the\r\ncase of husband and wife, where the interest may be accounted for in\r\nsympathy,--and all the women within hearing will take animated and\r\ndecided part with the sufferer. Swertha, notwithstanding her greed and\r\navarice, had her share of the generous feeling which does so much honour\r\nto her sex, and was, on this occasion, so much carried on by its\r\nimpulse, that she confronted her master, and upbraided him with his\r\nhard-hearted indifference, with a boldness at which she herself was\r\nastonished.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure it wasna her that suld be fearing for her young maister,\r\nMaister Mordaunt, even although he was, as she might weel say, the very\r\nsea-calf of her heart; but ony other father, but his honour himsell, wad\r\nhave had speerings made after the poor lad, and him gane this eight-days\r\nfrom Burgh-Westra, and naebody kend when or where he had gane. There\r\nwasna a bairn in the howff but was maining for him; for he made all\r\ntheir bits of boats with his knife; there wadna be a dry eye in the\r\nparish, if aught worse than weal should befall him,--na, no ane, unless\r\nit might be his honour's ain.\"\r\n\r\nMertoun had been much struck, and even silenced, by the insolent\r\nvolubility of his insurgent housekeeper; but, at the last sarcasm, he\r\nimposed on her silence in her turn with an audible voice, accompanied\r\nwith one of the most terrific glances which his dark eye and stern\r\nfeatures could express. But Swertha, who, as she afterwards acquainted\r\nthe Ranzelman, was wonderfully supported during the whole scene, would\r\nnot be controlled by the loud voice and ferocious look of her master,\r\nbut proceeded in the same tone as before.\r\n\r\n\"His honour,\" she said, \"had made an unco wark because a wheen bits of\r\nkists and duds, that naebody had use for, had been gathered on the beach\r\nby the poor bodies of the township; and here was the bravest lad in the\r\ncountry lost, and cast away, as it were, before his een, and nae are\r\nasking what was come o' him.\"\r\n\r\n\"What should come of him but good, you old fool,\" answered Mr. Mertoun,\r\n\"as far, at least, as there can be good in any of the follies he spends\r\nhis time in?\"\r\n\r\nThis was spoken rather in a scornful than an angry tone, and Swertha,\r\nwho had got into the spirit of the dialogue, was resolved not to let it\r\ndrop, now that the fire of her opponent seemed to slacken.\r\n\r\n\"O ay, to be sure I am an auld fule,--but if Maister Mordaunt should\r\nhave settled down in the Roost, as mair than ae boat had been lost in\r\nthat wearifu' squall the other morning--by good luck it was short as it\r\nwas sharp, or naething could have lived in it--or if he were drowned in\r\na loch coming hame on foot, or if he were killed by miss of footing on a\r\ncraig--the haill island kend how venturesome he was--who,\" said Swertha,\r\n\"will be the auld fule then?\" And she added a pathetic ejaculation, that\r\n\"God would protect the poor motherless bairn! for if he had had a\r\nmother, there would have been search made after him before now.\"\r\n\r\nThis last sarcasm affected Mertoun powerfully,--his jaw quivered, his\r\nface grew pale, and he muttered to Swertha to go into his study, (where\r\nshe was scarcely ever permitted to enter,) and fetch him a bottle which\r\nstood there.\r\n\r\n\"O ho!\" quoth Swertha to herself, as she hastened on the commission, \"my\r\nmaster knows where to find a cup of comfort to qualify his water with\r\nupon fitting occasions.\"\r\n\r\nThere was indeed a case of such bottles as were usually employed to hold\r\nstrong waters, but the dust and cobwebs in which they were enveloped\r\nshowed that they had not been touched for many years. With some\r\ndifficulty Swertha extracted the cork of one of them, by the help of a\r\nfork--for corkscrew was there none at Jarlshof--and having ascertained\r\nby smell, and, in case of any mistake, by a moderate mouthful, that it\r\ncontained wholesome Barbadoes-waters, she carried it into the room,\r\nwhere her master still continued to struggle with his faintness. She\r\nthen began to pour a small quantity into the nearest cup that she could\r\nfind, wisely judging, that, upon a person so much unaccustomed to the\r\nuse of spirituous liquors, a little might produce a strong effect. But\r\nthe patient signed to her impatiently to fill the cup, which might hold\r\nmore than the third of an English pint measure, up to the very brim, and\r\nswallowed it down without hesitation.\r\n\r\n\"Now the saunts above have a care on us!\" said Swertha; \"he will be\r\ndrunk as weel as mad, and wha is to guide him then, I wonder?\"\r\n\r\nBut Mertoun's breath and colour returned, without the slightest symptom\r\nof intoxication; on the contrary, Swertha afterwards reported, that,\r\n\"although she had always had a firm opinion in favour of a dram, yet she\r\nnever saw one work such miracles--he spoke mair like a man of the middle\r\nworld, than she had ever heard him since she had entered his service.\"\r\n\r\n\"Swertha,\" he said, \"you are right in this matter, and I was wrong.--Go\r\ndown to the Ranzelman directly, tell him to come and speak with me,\r\nwithout an instant's delay, and bring me special word what boats and\r\npeople he can command; I will employ them all in the search, and they\r\nshall be plentifully rewarded.\"\r\n\r\nStimulated by the spur which maketh the old woman proverbially to trot,\r\nSwertha posted down to the hamlet, with all the speed of threescore,\r\nrejoicing that her sympathetic feelings were likely to achieve their own\r\nreward, having given rise to a quest which promised to be so lucrative,\r\nand in the profits whereof she was determined to have her share,\r\nshouting out as she went, and long before she got within hearing, the\r\nnames of Niel Ronaldson, Sweyn Erickson, and the other friends and\r\nconfederates who were interested in her mission. To say the truth,\r\nnotwithstanding that the good dame really felt a deep interest in\r\nMordaunt Mertoun, and was mentally troubled on account of his absence,\r\nperhaps few things would have disappointed her more than if he had at\r\nthis moment started up in her path safe and sound, and rendered\r\nunnecessary, by his appearance, the expense and the bustle of searching\r\nafter him.\r\n\r\nSoon did Swertha accomplish her business in the village, and adjust with\r\nthe senators of the township her own little share of per centage upon\r\nthe profits likely to accrue on her mission; and speedily did she return\r\nto Jarlshof, with Niel Ronaldson by her side, schooling him to the best\r\nof her skill in all the peculiarities of her master.\r\n\r\n\"Aboon a' things,\" she said, \"never make him wait for an answer; and\r\nspeak loud and distinct, as if you were hailing a boat,--for he downa\r\nbide to say the same thing twice over; and if he asks about distance,\r\nye may make leagues for miles, for he kens naething about the face of\r\nthe earth that he lives upon; and if he speak of siller, ye may ask\r\ndollars for shillings, for he minds them nae mair than sclate-stanes.\"\r\n\r\nThus tutored, Niel Ronaldson was introduced into the presence of\r\nMertoun, but was utterly confounded to find that he could not act upon\r\nthe system of deception which had been projected. When he attempted, by\r\nsome exaggeration of distance and peril, to enhance the hire of the\r\nboats, and of the men, (for the search was to be by sea and land,) he\r\nfound himself at once cut short by Mertoun, who showed not only the most\r\nperfect knowledge of the country, but of distances, tides, currents, and\r\nall belonging to the navigation of those seas, although these were\r\ntopics with which he had hitherto appeared to be totally unacquainted.\r\nThe Ranzelman, therefore, trembled when they came to speak of the\r\nrecompense to be afforded for their exertions in the search; for it was\r\nnot more unlikely that Mertoun should be well informed of what was just\r\nand proper upon this head than upon others; and Niel remembered the\r\nstorm of his fury, when, at an early period after he had settled at\r\nJarlshof, he drove Swertha and Sweyn Erickson from his presence. As,\r\nhowever, he stood hesitating betwixt the opposite fears of asking too\r\nmuch or too little, Mertoun stopped his mouth, and ended his\r\nuncertainty, by promising him a recompense beyond what he dared have\r\nventured to ask, with an additional gratuity, in case they returned with\r\nthe pleasing intelligence that his son was safe.\r\n\r\nWhen this great point was settled, Niel Ronaldson, like a man of\r\nconscience, began to consider earnestly the various places where search\r\nshould be made after the young man; and having undertaken faithfully\r\nthat the enquiry should be prosecuted at all the houses of the gentry,\r\nboth in this and the neighbouring islands, he added, that, \"after all,\r\nif his honour would not be angry, there was ane not far off, that, if\r\nany body dared speer her a question, and if she liked to answer it,\r\ncould tell more about Maister Mordaunt than any body else could.--Ye\r\nwill ken wha I mean, Swertha? Her that was down at the haven this\r\nmorning.\" Thus he concluded, addressing himself with a mysterious look\r\nto the housekeeper, which she answered with a nod and a wink.\r\n\r\n\"How mean you?\" said Mertoun; \"speak out, short and open--whom do you\r\nspeak of?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is Norna of the Fitful-head,\" said Swertha, \"that the Ranzelman is\r\nthinking about; for she has gone up to Saint Ringan's Kirk this morning\r\non business of her own.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what can this person know of my son?\" said Mertoun; \"she is, I\r\nbelieve, a wandering madwoman, or impostor.\"\r\n\r\n\"If she wanders,\" said Swertha, \"it is for nae lack of means at hame,\r\nand that is weel known--plenty of a' thing has she of her ain, forby\r\nthat the Fowd himsell would let her want naething.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is that to my son?\" said Mertoun, impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"I dinna ken--she took unco pleasure in Maister Mordaunt from the time\r\nshe first saw him, and mony a braw thing she gave him at ae time or\r\nanother, forby the gowd chain that hangs about his bonny craig--folk say\r\nit is of fairy gold--I kenna what gold it is, but Bryce Snailsfoot says,\r\nthat the value will mount to an hundred pounds English, and that is nae\r\ndeaf nuts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go, Ronaldson,\" said Mertoun, \"or else send some one, to seek this\r\nwoman out--if you think there be a chance of her knowing any thing of my\r\nson.\"\r\n\r\n\"She kens a' thing that happens in thae islands,\" said Niel Ronaldson,\r\n\"muckle sooner than other folk, and that is Heaven's truth. But as to\r\ngoing to the kirk, or the kirkyard, to speer after her, there is not a\r\nman in Zetland will do it, for meed or for money--and that's Heaven's\r\ntruth as weel as the other.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cowardly, superstitious fools!\" said Mertoun.--\"But give me my cloak,\r\nSwertha.--This woman has been at Burgh-Westra--she is related to Troil's\r\nfamily--she may know something of Mordaunt's absence, and its cause--I\r\nwill seek her myself--She is at the Cross-kirk, you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not at the Cross-kirk, but at the auld Kirk of Saint Ringan's--it's\r\na dowie bit, and far frae being canny; and if your honour,\" added\r\nSwertha, \"wad walk by my rule, I wad wait until she came back, and no\r\ntrouble her when she may be mair busied wi' the dead, for ony thing that\r\nwe ken, than she is wi' the living. The like of her carena to have other\r\nfolk's een on them when they are, gude sain us! doing their ain\r\nparticular turns.\"\r\n\r\nMertoun made no answer, but throwing his cloak loosely around him, (for\r\nthe day was misty, with passing showers,) and leaving the decayed\r\nmansion of Jarlshof, he walked at a pace much faster than was usual with\r\nhim, taking the direction of the ruinous church, which stood, as he well\r\nknew, within three or four miles of his dwelling.\r\n\r\nThe Ranzelman and Swertha stood gazing after him in silence, until he\r\nwas fairly out of ear-shot, when, looking seriously on each other, and\r\nshaking their sagacious heads in the same boding degree of vibration,\r\nthey uttered their remarks in the same breath.\r\n\r\n\"Fools are aye fleet and fain,\" said Swertha.\r\n\r\n\"Fey folk run fast,\" added the Ranzelman; \"and the thing that we are\r\nborn to, we cannot win by.--I have known them that tried to stop folk\r\nthat were fey. You have heard of Helen Emberson of Camsey, how she\r\nstopped all the boles and windows about the house, that her gudeman\r\nmight not see daylight, and rise to the Haaf-fishing, because she feared\r\nfoul weather; and how the boat he should have sailed in was lost in the\r\nRoost; and how she came back, rejoicing in her gudeman's safety--but\r\nne'er may care, for there she found him drowned in his own masking-fat,\r\nwithin the wa's of his ain biggin; and moreover\"----\r\n\r\nBut here Swertha reminded the Ranzelman that he must go down to the\r\nhaven to get off the fishing-boats; \"for both that my heart is sair for\r\nthe bonny lad, and that I am fear'd he cast up of his ain accord before\r\nyou are at sea; and, as I have often told ye, my master may lead, but he\r\nwinna drive; and if ye do not his bidding, and get out to sea, the never\r\na bodle of boat-hire will ye see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Weel, weel, good dame,\" said the Ranzelman, \"we will launch as fast as\r\nwe can; and by good luck, neither Clawson's boat, nor Peter Grot's, is\r\nout to the Haaf this morning, for a rabbit ran across the path as they\r\nwere going on board, and they came back like wise men, kenning they wad\r\nbe called to other wark this day. And a marvel it is to think, Swertha,\r\nhow few real judicious men are left in this land. There is our great\r\nUdaller is weel eneugh when he is fresh, but he makes ower mony voyages\r\nin his ship and his yawl to be lang sae; and now, they say, his\r\ndaughter, Mistress Minna, is sair out of sorts.--Then there is Norna\r\nkens muckle mair than other folk, but wise woman ye cannot call her. Our\r\ntacksman here, Maister Mertoun, his wit is sprung in the bowsprit, I\r\ndoubt--his son is a daft gowk; and I ken few of consequence\r\nhereabouts--excepting always myself, and maybe you, Swertha--but what\r\nmay, in some sense or other, be called fules.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be, Niel Ronaldson,\" said the dame; \"but if you do not hasten\r\nthe faster to the shore, you will lose tide; and, as I said to my master\r\nsome short time syne, wha will be the fule then?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n        I do love these ancient ruins--\r\n  We never tread upon them but we set\r\n  Our foot upon some reverend history;\r\n  And, questionless, here, in this open court,\r\n  (Which now lies naked to the injuries\r\n  Of stormy weather,) some men lie interr'd,\r\n  Loved the Church so well, and gave so largely to it,\r\n  They thought it should have canopied their bones\r\n  Till doomsday;--but all things have their end--\r\n  Churches and cities, which have diseases like to men,\r\n  Must have like death which we have.\r\n\r\n                                         _Duchess of Malfy._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ruinous church of Saint Ninian had, in its time, enjoyed great\r\ncelebrity; for that mighty system of Roman superstition, which spread\r\nits roots over all Europe, had not failed to extend them even to this\r\nremote archipelago, and Zetland had, in the Catholic times, her saints,\r\nher shrines, and her relics, which, though little known elsewhere,\r\nattracted the homage, and commanded the observance, of the simple\r\ninhabitants of Thule. Their devotion to this church of Saint Ninian, or,\r\nas he was provincially termed, Saint Ringan, situated, as the edifice\r\nwas, close to the sea-beach, and serving, in many points, as a landmark\r\nto their boats, was particularly obstinate, and was connected with so\r\nmuch superstitious ceremonial and credulity, that the reformed clergy\r\nthought it best, by an order of the Church Courts, to prohibit all\r\nspiritual service within its walls, as tending to foster the rooted\r\nfaith of the simple and rude people around in saint-worship, and other\r\nerroneous doctrines of the Romish Church.\r\n\r\nAfter the Church of Saint Ninian had been thus denounced as a seat of\r\nidolatry, and desecrated of course, the public worship was transferred\r\nto another church; and the roof, with its lead and its rafters, having\r\nbeen stripped from the little rude old Gothic building, it was left in\r\nthe wilderness to the mercy of the elements. The fury of the\r\nuncontrolled winds, which howled along an exposed space, resembling that\r\nwhich we have described at Jarlshof, very soon choked up nave and aisle,\r\nand, on the north-west side, which was chiefly exposed to the wind, hid\r\nthe outside walls more than half way up with mounds of drifted sand,\r\nover which the gable-ends of the building, with the little belfry, which\r\nwas built above its eastern angle, arose in ragged and shattered\r\nnakedness of ruin.\r\n\r\nYet, deserted as it was, the Kirk of Saint Ringan still retained some\r\nsemblance of the ancient homage formerly rendered there. The rude and\r\nignorant fishermen of Dunrossness observed a practice, of which they\r\nthemselves had wellnigh forgotten the origin, and from which the\r\nProtestant Clergy in vain endeavoured to deter them. When their boats\r\nwere in extreme peril, it was common amongst them to propose to vow an\r\n_awmous_, as they termed it, that is, an alms, to Saint Ringan; and when\r\nthe danger was over, they never failed to absolve themselves of their\r\nvow, by coming singly and secretly to the old church, and putting off\r\ntheir shoes and stockings at the entrance of the churchyard, walking\r\nthrice around the ruins, observing that they did so in the course of the\r\nsun. When the circuit was accomplished for the third time, the votary\r\ndropped his offering, usually a small silver coin, through the mullions\r\nof a lanceolated window, which opened into a side aisle, and then\r\nretired, avoiding carefully to look behind him till he was beyond the\r\nprecincts which had once been hallowed ground; for it was believed that\r\nthe skeleton of the saint received the offering in his bony hand, and\r\nshowed his ghastly death's-head at the window into which it was thrown.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the scene was rendered more appalling to weak and ignorant\r\nminds, because the same stormy and eddying winds, which, on the one side\r\nof the church, threatened to bury the ruins with sand, and had, in fact,\r\nheaped it up in huge quantities, so as almost to hide the side-wall with\r\nits buttresses, seemed in other places bent on uncovering the graves of\r\nthose who had been laid to their long rest on the south-eastern quarter;\r\nand, after an unusually hard gale, the coffins, and sometimes the very\r\ncorpses, of those who had been interred without the usual cerements,\r\nwere discovered, in a ghastly manner, to the eyes of the living.\r\n\r\nIt was to this desolated place of worship that the elder Mertoun now\r\nproceeded, though without any of those religious or superstitious\r\npurposes with which the church of Saint Ringan was usually approached.\r\nHe was totally without the superstitious fears of the country,--nay,\r\nfrom the sequestered and sullen manner in which he lived, withdrawing\r\nhimself from human society even when assembled for worship, it was the\r\ngeneral opinion that he erred on the more fatal side, and believed\r\nrather too little than too much of that which the Church receives and\r\nenjoins to Christians.\r\n\r\nAs he entered the little bay, on the shore, and almost on the beach of\r\nwhich the ruins are situated, he could not help pausing for an instant,\r\nand becoming sensible that the scene, as calculated to operate on human\r\nfeelings, had been selected with much judgment as the site of a\r\nreligious house. In front lay the sea, into which two headlands, which\r\nformed the extremities of the bay, projected their gigantic causeways of\r\ndark and sable rocks, on the ledges of which the gulls, scouries, and\r\nother sea-fowl, appeared like flakes of snow; while, upon the lower\r\nranges of the cliff, stood whole lines of cormorants, drawn up alongside\r\nof each other, like soldiers in their battle array, and other living\r\nthing was there none to see. The sea, although not in a tempestuous\r\nstate, was disturbed enough to rush on these capes with a sound like\r\ndistant thunder, and the billows, which rose in sheets of foam half way\r\nup these sable rocks, formed a contrast of colouring equally striking\r\nand awful.\r\n\r\nBetwixt the extremities, or capes, of these projecting headlands, there\r\nrolled, on the day when Mertoun visited the scene, a deep and dense\r\naggregation of clouds, through which no human eye could penetrate, and\r\nwhich, bounding the vision, and excluding all view of the distant ocean,\r\nrendered it no unapt representation of the sea in the Vision of Mirza\r\nwhose extent was concealed by vapours, and clouds, and storms. The\r\nground rising steeply from the sea-beach, permitting no view into the\r\ninterior of the country, appeared a scene of irretrievable barrenness,\r\nwhere scrubby and stunted heath, intermixed with the long bent, or\r\ncoarse grass, which first covers sandy soils, were the only vegetables\r\nthat could be seen. Upon a natural elevation, which rose above the beach\r\nin the very bottom of the bay, and receded a little from the sea, so as\r\nto be without reach of the waves, arose the half-buried ruin which we\r\nhave already described, surrounded by a wasted, half-ruinous, and\r\nmouldering wall, which, breached in several places, served still to\r\ndivide the precincts of the cemetery. The mariners who were driven by\r\naccident into this solitary bay, pretended that the church was\r\noccasionally observed to be full of lights, and, from that circumstance,\r\nwere used to prophesy shipwrecks and deaths by sea.\r\n\r\nAs Mertoun approached near to the chapel, he adopted, insensibly, and\r\nperhaps without much premeditation, measures to avoid being himself\r\nseen, until he came close under the walls of the burial-ground, which he\r\napproached, as it chanced, on that side where the sand was blowing from\r\nthe graves, in the manner we have described.\r\n\r\nHere, looking through one of the gaps in the wall which time had made,\r\nhe beheld the person whom he sought, occupied in a manner which assorted\r\nwell with the ideas popularly entertained of her character, but which\r\nwas otherwise sufficiently extraordinary.\r\n\r\nShe was employed beside a rude monument, on one side of which was\r\nrepresented the rough outline of a cavalier, or knight, on horseback,\r\nwhile, on the other, appeared a shield, with the armorial bearings so\r\ndefaced as not to be intelligible; which escutcheon was suspended by one\r\nangle, contrary to the modern custom, which usually places them straight\r\nand upright. At the foot of this pillar was believed to repose, as\r\nMertoun had formerly heard, the bones of Ribolt Troil, one of the remote\r\nancestors of Magnus, and a man renowned for deeds of valorous emprize in\r\nthe fifteenth century. From the grave of this warrior Norna of the\r\nFitful-head seemed busied in shovelling the sand, an easy task where it\r\nwas so light and loose; so that it seemed plain that she would shortly\r\ncomplete what the rude winds had begun, and make bare the bones which\r\nlay there interred. As she laboured, she muttered her magic song; for\r\nwithout the Runic rhyme no form of northern superstition was ever\r\nperformed. We have perhaps preserved too many examples of these\r\nincantations; but we cannot help attempting to translate that which\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n  \"Champion, famed for warlike toil,\r\n  Art thou silent, Ribolt Troil?\r\n  Sand, and dust, and pebbly stones,\r\n  Are leaving bare thy giant bones.\r\n  Who dared touch the wild-bear's skin\r\n  Ye slumber'd on while life was in?--\r\n  A woman now, or babe, may come,\r\n  And cast the covering from thy tomb.\r\n\r\n  \"Yet be not wrathful, Chief, nor blight\r\n  Mine eyes or ears with sound or sight!\r\n  I come not, with unhallow'd tread,\r\n  To wake the slumbers of the dead,\r\n  Or lay thy giant relics bare;\r\n  But what I seek thou well canst spare.\r\n  Be it to my hand allow'd\r\n  To shear a merk's weight from thy shroud;\r\n  Yet leave thee sheeted lead enough\r\n  To shield thy bones from weather rough.\r\n\r\n  \"See, I draw my magic knife--\r\n  Never while thou wert in life\r\n  Laid'st thou still for sloth or fear,\r\n  When point and edge were glittering near;\r\n  See, the cerements now I sever--\r\n  Waken now, or sleep for ever!\r\n  Thou wilt not wake? the deed is done!--\r\n  The prize I sought is fairly won.\r\n\r\n  \"Thanks, Ribolt, thanks,--for this the sea\r\n  Shall smooth its ruffled crest for thee,--\r\n  And while afar its billows foam,\r\n  Subside to peace near Ribolt's tomb.\r\n  Thanks, Ribolt, thanks--for this the might\r\n  Of wild winds raging at their height,\r\n  When to thy place of slumber nigh,\r\n  Shall soften to a lullaby.\r\n\r\n  \"She, the dame of doubt and dread,\r\n  Norna of the Fitful-head,\r\n  Mighty in her own despite--\r\n  Miserable in her might;\r\n  In despair and frenzy great,--\r\n  In her greatness desolate;\r\n  Wisest, wickedest who lives,\r\n  Well can keep the word she gives.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Norna chanted the first part of this rhyme, she completed the task\r\nof laying bare a part of the leaden coffin of the ancient warrior, and\r\nsevered from it, with much caution and apparent awe, a portion of the\r\nmetal. She then reverentially threw back the sand upon the coffin; and\r\nby the time she had finished her song, no trace remained that the\r\nsecrets of the sepulchre had been violated.\r\n\r\nMertoun remained gazing on her from behind the churchyard wall during\r\nthe whole ceremony, not from any impression of veneration for her or her\r\nemployment, but because he conceived that to interrupt a madwoman in her\r\nact of madness, was not the best way to obtain from her such\r\nintelligence as she might have to impart. Meanwhile he had full time to\r\nconsider her figure, although her face was obscured by her dishevelled\r\nhair, and by the hood of her dark mantle, which permitted no more to be\r\nvisible than a Druidess would probably have exhibited at the celebration\r\nof her mystical rites. Mertoun had often heard of Norna before; nay, it\r\nis most probable that he might have seen her repeatedly, for she had\r\nbeen in the vicinity of Jarlshof more than once since his residence\r\nthere. But the absurd stories which were in circulation respecting her,\r\nprevented his paying any attention to a person whom he regarded as\r\neither an impostor or a madwoman, or a compound of both. Yet, now that\r\nhis attention was, by circumstances, involuntarily fixed upon her person\r\nand deportment, he could not help acknowledging to himself that she was\r\neither a complete enthusiast, or rehearsed her part so admirably, that\r\nno Pythoness of ancient times could have excelled her. The dignity and\r\nsolemnity of her gesture,--the sonorous, yet impressive tone of voice\r\nwith which she addressed the departed spirit whose mortal relics she\r\nventured to disturb, were such as failed not to make an impression upon\r\nhim, careless and indifferent as he generally appeared to all that went\r\non around him. But no sooner was her singular occupation terminated,\r\nthan, entering the churchyard with some difficulty, by clambering over\r\nthe disjointed ruins of the wall, he made Norna aware of his presence.\r\nFar from starting, or expressing the least surprise at his appearance in\r\na place so solitary, she said, in a tone that seemed to intimate that he\r\nhad been expected, \"So,--you have sought me at last?\"\r\n\r\n\"And found you,\" replied Mertoun, judging he would best introduce the\r\nenquiries he had to make, by assuming a tone which corresponded to her\r\nown.\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" she replied, \"found me you have, and in the place where all men\r\nmust meet--amid the tabernacles of the dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here we must, indeed, meet at last,\" replied Mertoun, glancing his\r\neyes on the desolate scene around, where headstones, half covered in\r\nsand, and others, from which the same wind had stripped the soil on\r\nwhich they rested, covered with inscriptions, and sculptured with the\r\nemblems of mortality, were the most conspicuous objects,--\"here, as in\r\nthe house of death, all men must meet at length; and happy those that\r\ncome soonest to the quiet haven.\"\r\n\r\n\"He that dares desire this haven,\" said Norna, \"must have steered a\r\nsteady course in the voyage of life. _I_ dare not hope for such quiet\r\nharbour. Darest _thou_ expect it? or has the course thou hast kept\r\ndeserved it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It matters not to my present purpose,\" replied Mertoun; \"I have to ask\r\nyou what tidings you know of my son Mordaunt Mertoun?\"\r\n\r\n\"A father,\" replied the sibyl, \"asks of a stranger what tidings she has\r\nof his son! How should I know aught of him? the cormorant says not to\r\nthe mallard, where is my brood?\"\r\n\r\n\"Lay aside this useless affectation of mystery,\" said Mertoun; \"with the\r\nvulgar and ignorant it has its effect, but upon me it is thrown away.\r\nThe people of Jarlshof have told me that you do know, or may know,\r\nsomething of Mordaunt Mertoun, who has not returned home after the\r\nfestival of Saint John's, held in the house of your relative, Magnus\r\nTroil. Give me such information, if indeed ye have it to give; and it\r\nshall be recompensed, if the means of recompense are in my power.\"\r\n\r\n\"The wide round of earth,\" replied Norna, \"holds nothing that I would\r\ncall a recompense for the slightest word that I throw away upon a living\r\near. But for thy son, if thou wouldst see him in life, repair to the\r\napproaching Fair of Kirkwall, in Orkney.\"\r\n\r\n\"And wherefore thither?\" said Mertoun; \"I know he had no purpose in that\r\ndirection.\"\r\n\r\n\"We drive on the stream of fate,\" answered Norna, \"without oar or\r\nrudder. You had no purpose this morning of visiting the Kirk of Saint\r\nRingan, yet you are here;--you had no purpose but a minute hence of\r\nbeing at Kirkwall, and yet you will go thither.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not unless the cause is more distinctly explained to me. I am no\r\nbeliever, dame, in those who assert your supernatural powers.\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall believe in them ere we part,\" said Norna. \"As yet you know\r\nbut little of me, nor shall you know more. But I know enough of you, and\r\ncould convince you with one word that I do so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Convince me, then,\" said Mertoun; \"for unless I am so convinced, there\r\nis little chance of my following your counsel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mark, then,\" said Norna, \"what I have to say on your son's score, else\r\nwhat I shall say to you on your own will banish every other thought from\r\nyour memory. You shall go to the approaching Fair at Kirkwall; and, on\r\nthe fifth day of the Fair, you shall walk, at the hour of noon, in the\r\nouter aisle of the Cathedral of Saint Magnus, and there you shall meet a\r\nperson who will give you tidings of your son.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must speak more distinctly, dame,\" returned Mertoun, scornfully,\r\n\"if you hope that I should follow your counsel. I have been fooled in my\r\ntime by women, but never so grossly as you seem willing to gull me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hearken, then!\" said the old woman. \"The word which I speak shall touch\r\nthe nearest secret of thy life, and thrill thee through nerve and bone.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, she whispered a word into Mertoun's ear, the effect of which\r\nseemed almost magical. He remained fixed and motionless with surprise,\r\nas, waving her arm slowly aloft, with an air of superiority and triumph,\r\nNorna glided from him, turned round a corner of the ruins, and was soon\r\nout of sight.\r\n\r\nMertoun offered not to follow, or to trace her. \"We fly from our fate in\r\nvain!\" he said, as he began to recover himself; and turning, he left\r\nbehind him the desolate ruins with their cemetery. As he looked back\r\nfrom the very last point at which the church was visible, he saw the\r\nfigure of Norna, muffled in her mantle, standing on the very summit of\r\nthe ruined tower, and stretching out in the sea-breeze something which\r\nresembled a white pennon, or flag. A feeling of horror, similar to that\r\nexcited by her last words, again thrilled through his bosom, and he\r\nhastened onwards with unwonted speed, until he had left the church of\r\nSaint Ninian, with its bay of sand, far behind him.\r\n\r\nUpon his arrival at Jarlshof, the alteration in his countenance was so\r\ngreat, that Swertha conjectured he was about to fall into one of those\r\nfits of deep melancholy which she termed his dark hour.\r\n\r\n\"And what better could be expected,\" thought Swertha, \"when he must\r\nneeds go visit Norna of the Fitful-head, when she was in the haunted\r\nKirk of Saint Ringan's?\"\r\n\r\nBut without testifying any other symptoms of an alienated mind, than\r\nthat of deep and sullen dejection, her master acquainted her with his\r\nintention to go to the Fair of Kirkwall,--a thing so contrary to his\r\nusual habits, that the housekeeper wellnigh refused to credit her ears.\r\nShortly after, he heard, with apparent indifference, the accounts\r\nreturned by the different persons who had been sent out in quest of\r\nMordaunt, by sea and land, who all of them returned without any tidings.\r\nThe equanimity with which Mertoun heard the report of their bad success,\r\nconvinced Swertha still more firmly, that, in his interview with Norna,\r\nthat issue had been predicted to him by the sibyl whom he had consulted.\r\n\r\nThe township were yet more surprised, when their tacksman, Mr. Mertoun,\r\nas if on some sudden resolution, made preparations to visit Kirkwall\r\nduring the Fair, although he had hitherto avoided sedulously all such\r\nplaces of public resort. Swertha puzzled herself a good deal, without\r\nbeing able to penetrate this mystery; and vexed herself still more\r\nconcerning the fate of her young master. But her concern was much\r\nsoftened by the deposit of a sum of money, seeming, however moderate in\r\nitself, a treasure in her eyes, which her master put into her hands,\r\nacquainting her at the same time, that he had taken his passage for\r\nKirkwall, in a small bark belonging to the proprietor of the island of\r\nMousa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n  Nae langer she wept,--her tears were a' spent,--\r\n  Despair it was come, and she thought it content;\r\n  She thought it content, but her cheek it grew pale,\r\n  And she droop'd, like a lily broke down by the hail.\r\n\r\n                 _Continuation of Auld Robin Gray_.[14](_d_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe condition of Minna much resembled that of the village heroine in\r\nLady Ann Lindsay's beautiful ballad. Her natural firmness of mind\r\nprevented her from sinking under the pressure of the horrible secret,\r\nwhich haunted her while awake, and was yet more tormenting during her\r\nbroken and hurried slumbers. There is no grief so dreadful as that which\r\nwe dare not communicate, and in which we can neither ask nor desire\r\nsympathy; and when to this is added the burden of a guilty mystery to an\r\ninnocent bosom, there is little wonder that Minna's health should have\r\nsunk under the burden.\r\n\r\nTo the friends around, her habits and manners, nay, her temper, seemed\r\naltered to such an extraordinary degree, that it is no wonder that some\r\nshould have ascribed the change to witchcraft, and some to incipient\r\nmadness. She became unable to bear the solitude in which she formerly\r\ndelighted to spend her time; yet when she hurried into society, it was\r\nwithout either joining in, or attending to, what passed. Generally she\r\nappeared wrapped in sad, and even sullen abstraction, until her\r\nattention was suddenly roused by some casual mention of the name of\r\nCleveland, or of Mordaunt Mertoun, at which she started, with the horror\r\nof one who sees the lighted match applied to a charged mine, and expects\r\nto be instantly involved in the effects of the explosion. And when she\r\nobserved that the discovery was not yet made, it was so far from being a\r\nconsolation, that she almost wished the worst were known, rather than\r\nendure the continued agonies of suspense.\r\n\r\nHer conduct towards her sister was so variable, yet uniformly so painful\r\nto the kind-hearted Brenda, that it seemed to all around, one of the\r\nstrongest features of her malady. Sometimes Minna was impelled to seek\r\nher sister's company, as if by the consciousness that they were common\r\nsufferers by a misfortune of which she herself alone could grasp the\r\nextent; and then suddenly the feeling of the injury which Brenda had\r\nreceived through the supposed agency of Cleveland, made her unable to\r\nbear her presence, and still less to endure the consolation which her\r\nsister, mistaking the nature of her malady, vainly endeavoured to\r\nadminister. Frequently, also, did it happen, that, while Brenda was\r\nimploring her sister to take comfort, she incautiously touched upon some\r\nsubject which thrilled to the very centre of her soul; so that, unable\r\nto conceal her agony, Minna would rush hastily from the apartment. All\r\nthese different moods, though they too much resembled, to one who knew\r\nnot their real source, the caprices of unkind estrangement, Brenda\r\nendured with such prevailing and unruffled gentleness of disposition,\r\nthat Minna was frequently moved to shed floods of tears upon her neck;\r\nand, perhaps, the moments in which she did so, though embittered by the\r\nrecollection that her fatal secret concerned the destruction of Brenda's\r\nhappiness as well as her own, were still, softened as they were by\r\nsisterly affection, the most endurable moments of this most miserable\r\nperiod of her life.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the alternations of moping melancholy, fearful agitation,\r\nand bursts of nervous feeling, were soon visible on the poor young\r\nwoman's face and person. She became pale and emaciated; her eye lost the\r\nsteady quiet look of happiness and innocence, and was alternately dim\r\nand wild, as she was acted upon by a general feeling of her own\r\ndistressful condition, or by some quicker and more poignant sense of\r\nagony. Her very features seemed to change, and become sharp and eager,\r\nand her voice, which, in its ordinary tones, was low and placid, now\r\nsometimes sunk in indistinct mutterings, and sometimes was raised beyond\r\nthe natural key, in hasty and abrupt exclamations. When in company with\r\nothers, she was sullenly silent, and, when she ventured into solitude,\r\nwas observed (for it was now thought very proper to watch her on such\r\noccasions) to speak much to herself.\r\n\r\nThe pharmacy of the islands was in vain resorted to by Minna's anxious\r\nfather. Sages of both sexes, who knew the virtues of every herb which\r\ndrinks the dew, and augmented those virtues by words of might, used\r\nwhile they prepared and applied the medicines, were attended with no\r\nbenefit; and Magnus, in the utmost anxiety, was at last induced to have\r\nrecourse to the advice of his kinswoman, Norna of the Fitful-head,\r\nalthough, owing to circumstances noticed in the course of the story,\r\nthere was at this time some estrangement between them. His first\r\napplication was in vain. Norna was then at her usual place of residence,\r\nupon the sea-coast, near the headland from which she usually took her\r\ndesignation; but, although Eric Scambester himself brought the message,\r\nshe refused positively to see him, or to return any answer.\r\n\r\nMagnus was angry at the slight put upon his messenger and message, but\r\nhis anxiety on Minna's account, as well as the respect which he had for\r\nNorna's real misfortunes and imputed wisdom and power, prevented him\r\nfrom indulging, on the present occasion, his usual irritability of\r\ndisposition. On the contrary, he determined to make an application to\r\nhis kinswoman in his own person. He kept his purpose, however, to\r\nhimself, and only desired his daughters to be in readiness to attend him\r\nupon a visit to a relation whom he had not seen for some time, and\r\ndirected them, at the same time, to carry some provisions along with\r\nthem, as the journey was distant, and they might perhaps find their\r\nfriend unprovided.\r\n\r\nUnaccustomed to ask explanations of his pleasure, and hoping that\r\nexercise and the amusement of such an excursion might be of service to\r\nher sister, Brenda, upon whom all household and family charges now\r\ndevolved, caused the necessary preparations to be made for the\r\nexpedition; and, on the next morning, they were engaged in tracing the\r\nlong and tedious course of beach and of moorland, which, only varied by\r\noccasional patches of oats and barley, where a little ground had been\r\nselected for cultivation, divided Burgh-Westra from the north-western\r\nextremity of the Mainland, (as the principal island is called,) which\r\nterminates in the cape called Fitful-head, as the south-western point\r\nends in the cape of Sumburgh.\r\n\r\nOn they went, through wild and over wold, the Udaller bestriding a\r\nstrong, square-made, well-barrelled palfrey, of Norwegian breed,\r\nsomewhat taller, and yet as stout, as the ordinary ponies of the\r\ncountry; while Minna and Brenda, famed, amongst other accomplishments,\r\nfor their horsemanship, rode two of those hardy animals, which, bred and\r\nreared with more pains than is usually bestowed, showed, both by the\r\nneatness of their form and their activity, that the race, so much and so\r\ncarelessly neglected, is capable of being improved into beauty without\r\nlosing any thing of its spirit or vigour. They were attended by two\r\nservants on horseback, and two on foot, secure that the last\r\ncircumstance would be no delay to their journey, because a great part of\r\nthe way was so rugged, or so marshy, that the horses could only move at\r\na foot pace; and that, whenever they met with any considerable tract of\r\nhard and even ground, they had only to borrow from the nearest herd of\r\nponies the use of a couple for the accommodation of these pedestrians.\r\n\r\nThe journey was a melancholy one, and little conversation passed, except\r\nwhen the Udaller, pressed by impatience and vexation, urged his pony to\r\na quick pace, and again, recollecting Minna's weak state of health,\r\nslackened to a walk, and reiterated enquiries how she felt herself, and\r\nwhether the fatigue was not too much for her. At noon the party halted,\r\nand partook of some refreshment, for which they had made ample\r\nprovision, beside a pleasant spring, the pureness of whose waters,\r\nhowever, did not suit the Udaller's palate, until qualified by a\r\nliberal addition of right Nantz. After he had a second, yea and a third\r\ntime, filled a large silver travelling-cup, embossed with a German Cupid\r\nsmoking a pipe, and a German Bacchus emptying his flask down the throat\r\nof a bear, he began to become more talkative than vexation had permitted\r\nhim to be during the early part of their journey, and thus addressed his\r\ndaughters:--\r\n\r\n\"Well, children, we are within a league or two of Norna's dwelling, and\r\nwe shall soon see how the old spell-mutterer will receive us.\"\r\n\r\nMinna interrupted her father with a faint exclamation, while Brenda,\r\nsurprised to a great degree, exclaimed, \"Is it then to Norna that we are\r\nto make this visit?--Heaven forbid!\"\r\n\r\n\"And wherefore should Heaven forbid?\" said the Udaller, knitting his\r\nbrows; \"wherefore, I would gladly know, should Heaven forbid me to visit\r\nmy kinswoman, whose skill may be of use to your sister, if any woman in\r\nZetland, or man either, can be of service to her?--You are a fool,\r\nBrenda,--your sister has more sense.--Cheer up, Minna!--thou wert ever\r\nwont to like her songs and stories, and used to hang about her neck,\r\nwhen little Brenda cried and ran from her like a Spanish merchantman\r\nfrom a Dutch caper.\"[15]\r\n\r\n\"I wish she may not frighten me as much to-day, father,\" replied Brenda,\r\ndesirous of indulging Minna in her taciturnity, and at the same time to\r\namuse her father by sustaining the conversation; \"I have heard so much\r\nof her dwelling, that I am rather alarmed at the thought of going there\r\nuninvited.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou art a fool,\" said Magnus, \"to think that a visit from her\r\nkinsfolks can ever come amiss to a kind, hearty, Hialtland heart, like\r\nmy cousin Norna's.--And, now I think on't, I will be sworn that is the\r\nreason why she would not receive Eric Scambester!--It is many a long day\r\nsince I have seen her chimney smoke, and I have never carried you\r\nthither--She hath indeed some right to call me unkind. But I will tell\r\nher the truth--and that is, that though such be the fashion, I do not\r\nthink it is fair or honest to eat up the substance of lone women-folks,\r\nas we do that of our brother Udallers, when we roll about from house to\r\nhouse in the winter season, until we gather like a snowball, and eat up\r\nall wherever we come.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is no fear of our putting Norna to any distress just now,\"\r\nreplied Brenda, \"for I have ample provision of every thing that we can\r\npossibly need--fish, and bacon, and salted mutton, and dried geese--more\r\nthan we could eat in a week, besides enough of liquor for you, father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right, right, my girl!\" said the Udaller; \"a well-found ship makes a\r\nmerry voyage--so we shall only want the kindness of Norna's roof, and a\r\nlittle bedding for you; for, as to myself, my sea-cloak, and honest dry\r\nboards of Norway deal, suit me better than your eider-down cushions and\r\nmattresses. So that Norna will have the pleasure of seeing us without\r\nhaving a stiver's worth of trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish she may think it a pleasure, sir,\" replied Brenda.\r\n\r\n\"Why, what does the girl mean, in the name of the Martyr?\" replied\r\nMagnus Troil; \"dost thou think my kinswoman is a heathen, who will not\r\nrejoice to see her own flesh and blood?--I would I were as sure of a\r\ngood year's fishing!--No, no! I only fear we may find her from home at\r\npresent, for she is often a wanderer, and all with thinking over much on\r\nwhat can never be helped.\"\r\n\r\nMinna sighed deeply as her father spoke, and the Udaller went on:--\r\n\r\n\"Dost thou sigh at that, my girl?--why, 'tis the fault of half the\r\nworld--let it never be thine own, Minna.\"\r\n\r\nAnother suppressed sigh intimated that the caution came too late.\r\n\r\n\"I believe you are afraid of my cousin as well as Brenda is,\" said the\r\nUdaller, gazing on her pale countenance; \"if so, speak the word, and we\r\nwill return back again as if we had the wind on our quarter, and were\r\nrunning fifteen knots by the line.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do, for Heaven's sake, sister, let us return!\" said Brenda,\r\nimploringly; \"you know--you remember--you must be well aware that Norna\r\ncan do nought to help you.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is but too true,\" said Minna, in a subdued voice; \"but I know\r\nnot--she may answer a question--a question that only the miserable dare\r\nask of the miserable.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, my kinswoman is no miser,\" answered the Udaller, who only heard\r\nthe beginning of the word; \"a good income she has, both in Orkney and\r\nhere, and many a fair lispund of butter is paid to her. But the poor\r\nhave the best share of it, and shame fall the Zetlander who begrudges\r\nthem; the rest she spends, I wot not how, in her journeys through the\r\nislands. But you will laugh to see her house, and Nick Strumpfer, whom\r\nshe calls Pacolet--many folks think Nick is the devil; but he is flesh\r\nand blood, like any of us--his father lived in Græmsay--I shall be glad\r\nto see Nick again.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the Udaller thus ran on, Brenda, who, in recompense for a less\r\nportion of imagination than her sister, was gifted with sound common\r\nsense, was debating with herself the probable effect of this visit on\r\nher sister's health. She came finally to the resolution of speaking with\r\nher father aside, upon the first occasion which their journey should\r\nafford. To him she determined to communicate the whole particulars of\r\ntheir nocturnal interview with Norna,--to which, among other agitating\r\ncauses, she attributed the depression of Minna's spirits,--and then make\r\nhimself the judge whether he ought to persist in his visit to a person\r\nso singular, and expose his daughter to all the shock which her nerves\r\nmight possibly receive from the interview.\r\n\r\nJust as she had arrived at this conclusion, her father, dashing the\r\ncrumbs from his laced waistcoat with one hand, and receiving with the\r\nother a fourth cup of brandy and water, drank devoutly to the success of\r\ntheir voyage, and ordered all to be in readiness to set forward. Whilst\r\nthey were saddling their ponies, Brenda, with some difficulty, contrived\r\nto make her father understand she wished to speak with him in\r\nprivate--no small surprise to the honest Udaller, who, though secret as\r\nthe grave in the very few things where he considered secrecy as of\r\nimportance, was so far from practising mystery in general, that his most\r\nimportant affairs were often discussed by him openly in presence of his\r\nwhole family, servants included.\r\n\r\nBut far greater was his astonishment, when, remaining purposely with his\r\ndaughter Brenda, a little in the wake, as he termed it, of the other\r\nriders, he heard the whole account of Norna's visit to Burgh-Westra, and\r\nof the communication with which she had then astounded his daughters.\r\nFor a long time he could utter nothing but interjections, and ended with\r\na thousand curses on his kinswoman's folly in telling his daughters such\r\na history of horror.\r\n\r\n\"I have often heard,\" said the Udaller, \"that she was quite mad, with\r\nall her wisdom, and all her knowledge of the seasons; and, by the bones\r\nof my namesake, the Martyr, I begin now to believe it most assuredly! I\r\nknow no more how to steer than if I had lost my compass. Had I known\r\nthis before we set out, I think I had remained at home; but now that we\r\nhave come so far, and that Norna expects us\"----\r\n\r\n\"Expects us, father!\" said Brenda; \"how can that be possible?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that I know not--but she that can tell how the wind is to blow,\r\ncan tell which way we are designing to ride. She must not be\r\nprovoked;--perhaps she has done my family this ill for the words I had\r\nwith her about that lad Mordaunt Mertoun, and if so, she can undo it\r\nagain;--and so she shall, or I will know the cause wherefore. But I will\r\ntry fair words first.\"\r\n\r\nFinding it thus settled that they were to go forward, Brenda endeavoured\r\nnext to learn from her father whether Norna's tale was founded in\r\nreality. He shook his head, groaned bitterly, and, in a few words,\r\nacknowledged that the whole, so far as concerned her intrigue with a\r\nstranger, and her father's death, of which she became the accidental and\r\nmost innocent cause, was a matter of sad and indisputable truth. \"For\r\nher infant,\" he said, \"he could never, by any means, learn what became\r\nof it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Her infant!\" exclaimed Brenda; \"she spoke not a word of her infant!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I wish my tongue had been blistered,\" said the Udaller, \"when I\r\ntold you of it!--I see that, young and old, a man has no better chance\r\nof keeping a secret from you women, than an eel to keep himself in his\r\nhold when he is sniggled with a loop of horse-hair--sooner or later the\r\nfisher teazes him out of his hole, when he has once the noose round his\r\nneck.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the infant, my father,\" said Brenda, still insisting on the\r\nparticulars of this extraordinary story, \"what became of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Carried off, I fancy, by the blackguard Vaughan,\" answered the Udaller,\r\nwith a gruff accent, which plainly betokened how weary he was of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n\"By Vaughan?\" said Brenda, \"the lover of poor Norna, doubtless!--what\r\nsort of man was he, father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, much like other men, I fancy,\" answered the Udaller; \"I never saw\r\nhim in my life.--He kept company with the Scottish families at Kirkwall;\r\nand I with the good old Norse folk--Ah! if Norna had dwelt always\r\namongst her own kin, and not kept company with her Scottish\r\nacquaintance, she would have known nothing of Vaughan, and things might\r\nhave been otherwise--But then I should have known nothing of your\r\nblessed mother, Brenda--and that,\" he said, his large blue eyes shining\r\nwith a tear, \"would have saved me a short joy and a long sorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Norna could but ill have supplied my mother's place to you, father, as\r\na companion and a friend--that is, judging from all I have heard,\" said\r\nBrenda, with some hesitation. But Magnus, softened by recollections of\r\nhis beloved wife, answered her with more indulgence than she expected.\r\n\r\n\"I would have been content,\" he said, \"to have wedded Norna at that\r\ntime. It would have been the soldering of an old quarrel--the healing of\r\nan old sore. All our blood relations wished it, and, situated as I was,\r\nespecially not having seen your blessed mother, I had little will to\r\noppose their counsels. You must not judge of Norna or of me by such an\r\nappearance as we now present to you--She was young and beautiful, and I\r\ngamesome as a Highland buck, and little caring what haven I made for,\r\nhaving, as I thought, more than one under my lee. But Norna preferred\r\nthis man Vaughan, and, as I told you before, it was, perhaps, the best\r\nkindness she could have done to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, poor kinswoman!\" said Brenda. \"But believe you, father, in the high\r\npowers which she claims--in the mysterious vision of the dwarf--in\r\nthe\"----\r\n\r\nShe was interrupted in these questions by Magnus, to whom they were\r\nobviously displeasing.\r\n\r\n\"I believe, Brenda,\" he said, \"according to the belief of my\r\nforefathers--I pretend not to be a wiser man than they were in their\r\ntime,--and they all believed that, in cases of great worldly distress,\r\nProvidence opened the eyes of the mind, and afforded the sufferers a\r\nvision of futurity. It was but a trimming of the boat, with\r\nreverence,\"--here he touched his hat reverentially; \"and, after all the\r\nshifting of ballast, poor Norna is as heavily loaded in the bows as ever\r\nwas an Orkneyman's yawl at the dog-fishing--she has more than affliction\r\nenough on board to balance whatever gifts she may have had in the midst\r\nof her calamity. They are as painful to her, poor soul, as a crown of\r\nthorns would be to her brows, though it were the badge of the empire of\r\nDenmark. And do not you, Brenda, seek to be wiser than your fathers.\r\nYour sister Minna, before she was so ill, had as much reverence for\r\nwhatever was produced in Norse, as if it had been in the Pope's bull,\r\nwhich is all written in pure Latin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor Norna!\" repeated Brenda; \"and her child--was it never recovered?\"\r\n\r\n\"What do I know of her child,\" said the Udaller, more gruffly than\r\nbefore, \"except that she was very ill, both before and after the birth,\r\nthough we kept her as merry as we could with pipe and harp, and so\r\nforth;--the child had come before its time into this bustling world, so\r\nit is likely it has been long dead.--But you know nothing of all these\r\nmatters, Brenda; so get along for a foolish girl, and ask no more\r\nquestions about what it does not become you to enquire into.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, the Udaller gave his sturdy little palfrey the spur, and\r\ncantering forward over rough and smooth, while the pony's accuracy and\r\nfirmness of step put all difficulties of the path at secure defiance, he\r\nplaced himself soon by the side of the melancholy Minna, and permitted\r\nher sister to have no farther share in his conversation than as it was\r\naddressed to them jointly. She could but comfort herself with the hope,\r\nthat, as Minna's disease appeared to have its seat in the imagination,\r\nthe remedies recommended by Norna might have some chance of being\r\neffectual, since, in all probability, they would be addressed to the\r\nsame faculty.\r\n\r\nTheir way had hitherto held chiefly over moss and moor, varied\r\noccasionally by the necessity of making a circuit around the heads of\r\nthose long lagoons, called voes, which run up into and indent the\r\ncountry in such a manner, that, though the Mainland of Zetland may be\r\nthirty miles or more in length, there is, perhaps, no part of it which\r\nis more than three miles distant from the salt water. But they had now\r\napproached the north-western extremity of the isle, and travelled along\r\nthe top of an immense ridge of rocks, which had for ages withstood the\r\nrage of the Northern Ocean, and of all the winds by which it is\r\nbuffeted.\r\n\r\nAt length exclaimed Magnus to his daughters, \"There is Norna's\r\ndwelling!--Look up, Minna, my love; for if this does not make you laugh,\r\nnothing will.--Saw you ever any thing but an osprey that would have made\r\nsuch a nest for herself as that is?--By my namesake's bones, there is\r\nnot the like of it that living thing ever dwelt in, (having no wings and\r\nthe use of reason,) unless it chanced to be the Frawa-Stack off Papa,\r\nwhere the King's daughter of Norway was shut up to keep her from her\r\nlovers--and all to little purpose, if the tale be true;[16] for,\r\nmaidens, I would have you to wot that it is hard to keep flax from the\r\nlowe.\"[17]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[14] It is worth while saying, that this motto, and the ascription of\r\nthe beautiful ballad from which it is taken to the Right Honourable Lady\r\nAnn Lindsay, occasioned the ingenious authoress's acknowledgment of the\r\nballad, of which the Editor, by her permission, published a small\r\nimpression, inscribed to the Bannatyne Club.\r\n\r\n[15] A light-armed vessel of the seventeenth century, adapted for\r\nprivateering, and much used by the Dutch.\r\n\r\n[16] The _Frawa-Stack_ or Maiden-Rock, an inaccessible cliff, divided by\r\na narrow gulf from the Island of Papa, has on the summit some ruins,\r\nconcerning which there is a legend similar to that of Danaë.\r\n\r\n[17] _Lowe_, flame.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n  Thrice from the cavern's darksome womb\r\n    Her groaning voice arose;\r\n  And come, my daughter, fearless come,\r\n    And fearless tell thy woes!\r\n\r\n                                                     MEIKLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dwelling of Norna, though none but a native of Zetland, familiar,\r\nduring his whole life, with every variety of rock-scenery, could have\r\nseen any thing ludicrous in this situation, was not unaptly compared by\r\nMagnus Troil to the eyry of the osprey, or sea-eagle. It was very small,\r\nand had been fabricated out of one of those dens which are called Burghs\r\nand Picts-houses in Zetland, and Duns on the mainland of Scotland and\r\nthe Hebrides, and which seem to be the first effort at architecture--the\r\nconnecting link betwixt a fox's hole in a cairn of loose stones, and an\r\nattempt to construct a human habitation out of the same materials,\r\nwithout the use of lime or cement of any kind,--without any timber, so\r\nfar as can be seen from their remains,--without any knowledge of the\r\narch or of the stair. Such as they are, however, the numerous remains of\r\nthese dwellings--for there is one found on every headland, islet, or\r\npoint of vantage, which could afford the inhabitants additional means of\r\ndefence--tend to prove that the remote people by whom these Burghs were\r\nconstructed, were a numerous race, and that the islands had then a much\r\ngreater population, than, from other circumstances, we might have been\r\nled to anticipate.\r\n\r\nThe Burgh of which we at present speak had been altered and repaired at\r\na later period, probably by some petty despot, or sea-rover, who,\r\ntempted by the security of the situation, which occupied the whole of a\r\nprojecting point of rock, and was divided from the mainland by a rent or\r\nchasm of some depth, had built some additions to it in the rudest style\r\nof Gothic defensive architecture;--had plastered the inside with lime\r\nand clay, and broken out windows for the admission of light and air;\r\nand, finally, by roofing it over, and dividing it into stories, by means\r\nof beams of wreck-wood, had converted the whole into a tower, resembling\r\na pyramidical dovecot, formed by a double wall, still containing within\r\nits thickness that set of circular galleries, or concentric rings, which\r\nis proper to all the forts of this primitive construction, and which\r\nseem to have constituted the only shelter which they were originally\r\nqualified to afford to their shivering inhabitants.[18]\r\n\r\nThis singular habitation, built out of the loose stones which lay\r\nscattered around, and exposed for ages to the vicissitudes of the\r\nelements, was as grey, weatherbeaten, and wasted, as the rock on which\r\nit was founded, and from which it could not easily be distinguished, so\r\ncompletely did it resemble in colour, and so little did it differ in\r\nregularity of shape, from a pinnacle or fragment of the cliff.\r\n\r\nMinna's habitual indifference to all that of late had passed around her,\r\nwas for a moment suspended by the sight of an abode, which, at another\r\nand happier period of her life, would have attracted at once her\r\ncuriosity and her wonder. Even now she seemed to feel interest as she\r\ngazed upon this singular retreat, and recollected it was that of certain\r\nmisery and probable insanity, connected, as its inhabitant asserted, and\r\nMinna's faith admitted, with power over the elements, and the capacity\r\nof intercourse with the invisible world.\r\n\r\n\"Our kinswoman,\" she muttered, \"has chosen her dwelling well, with no\r\nmore of earth than a sea-fowl might rest upon, and all around sightless\r\ntempests and raging waves. Despair and magical power could not have a\r\nfitter residence.\"\r\n\r\nBrenda, on the other hand, shuddered when she looked on the dwelling to\r\nwhich they were advancing, by a difficult, dangerous, and precarious\r\npath, which sometimes, to her great terror, approached to the verge of\r\nthe precipice; so that, Zetlander as she was, and confident as she had\r\nreason to be, in the steadiness and sagacity of the sure-footed pony,\r\nshe could scarce suppress an inclination to giddiness, especially at one\r\npoint, when, being foremost of the party, and turning a sharp angle of\r\nthe rock, her feet, as they projected from the side of the pony, hung\r\nfor an instant sheer over the ledge of the precipice, so that there was\r\nnothing save empty space betwixt the sole of her shoe and the white foam\r\nof the vexed ocean, which dashed, howled, and foamed, five hundred feet\r\nbelow. What would have driven a maiden of another country into delirium,\r\ngave her but a momentary uneasiness, which was instantly lost in the\r\nhope that the impression which the scene appeared to make on her\r\nsister's imagination might be favourable to her cure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nShe could not help looking back to see how Minna should pass the point\r\nof peril, which she herself had just rounded; and could hear the\r\nstrong voice of the Udaller, though to him such rough paths were\r\nfamiliar as the smooth sea-beach, call, in a tone of some anxiety, \"Take\r\nheed, jarto,\"[19] as Minna, with an eager look, dropped her bridle, and\r\nstretched forward her arms, and even her body, over the precipice, in\r\nthe attitude of the wild swan, when balancing itself, and spreading its\r\nbroad pinions, it prepares to launch from the cliff upon the bosom of\r\nthe winds. Brenda felt, at that instant, a pang of unutterable terror,\r\nwhich left a strong impression on her nerves, even when relieved, as it\r\ninstantly was, by her sister recovering herself and sitting upright on\r\nher saddle, the opportunity and temptation (if she felt it) passing\r\naway, as the quiet steady animal which supported her rounded the\r\nprojecting angle, and turned its patient and firm step from the verge of\r\nthe precipice.\r\n\r\nThey now attained a more level and open space of ground, being the flat\r\ntop of an isthmus of projecting rock, narrowing again towards a point\r\nwhere it was terminated by the chasm which separated the small peak, or\r\n_stack_, occupied by Norna's habitation, from the main ridge of cliff\r\nand precipice. This natural fosse, which seemed to have been the work of\r\nsome convulsion of nature, was deep, dark, and irregular, narrower\r\ntowards the bottom, which could not be distinctly seen, and widest at\r\ntop, having the appearance as if that part of the cliff occupied by the\r\nbuilding had been half rent away from the isthmus which it\r\nterminated,--an idea favoured by the angle at which it seemed to recede\r\nfrom the land, and lean towards the sea, with the building which crowned\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThis angle of projection was so considerable, that it required\r\nrecollection to dispel the idea that the rock, so much removed from the\r\nperpendicular, was about to precipitate itself seaward, with its old\r\ntower: and a timorous person would have been afraid to put foot upon it,\r\nlest an addition of weight, so inconsiderable as that of the human body,\r\nshould hasten a catastrophe which seemed at every instant impending.\r\n\r\nWithout troubling himself about such fantasies, the Udaller rode towards\r\nthe tower, and there dismounting along with his daughters, gave the\r\nponies in charge to one of their domestics, with directions to\r\ndisencumber them of their burdens, and turn them out for rest and\r\nrefreshment upon the nearest heath. This done, they approached the gate,\r\nwhich seemed formerly to have been connected with the land by a rude\r\ndrawbridge, some of the apparatus of which was still visible. But the\r\nrest had been long demolished, and was replaced by a stationary\r\nfootbridge, formed of barrel-staves covered with turf, very narrow and\r\nledgeless, and supported by a sort of arch, constructed out of the\r\njaw-bones of the whale. Along this \"brigg of dread\" the Udaller stepped\r\nwith his usual portly majesty of stride, which threatened its demolition\r\nand his own at the same time; his daughters trode more lightly and more\r\nsafely after him, and the whole party stood before the low and rugged\r\nportal of Norna's habitation.\r\n\r\n\"If she should be abroad after all,\" said Magnus, as he plied the black\r\noaken door with repeated blows;--\"but if so, we will at least lie by a\r\nday for her return, and make Nick Strumpfer pay the demurrage in bland\r\nand brandy.\"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke, the door opened, and displayed, to the alarm of Brenda,\r\nand the surprise of Minna herself, a square-made dwarf, about four feet\r\nfive inches high, with a head of most portentous size, and features\r\ncorrespondent--namely, a huge mouth, a tremendous nose, with large black\r\nnostrils, which seemed to have been slit upwards, blubber lips of an\r\nunconscionable size, and huge wall-eyes, with which he leared, sneered,\r\ngrinned, and goggled on the Udaller as an old acquaintance, without\r\nuttering a single word. The young women could hardly persuade themselves\r\nthat they did not see before their eyes the very demon Trolld, who made\r\nsuch a distinguished figure in Norna's legend. Their father went on\r\naddressing this uncouth apparition in terms of such condescending\r\nfriendship as the better sort apply to their inferiors, when they wish,\r\nfor any immediate purpose, to conciliate or coax them,--a tone, by the\r\nby, which generally contains, in its very familiarity, as much offence\r\nas the more direct assumption of distance and superiority.\r\n\r\n\"Ha, Nick! honest Nick!\" said the Udaller, \"here you are, lively and\r\nlovely as Saint Nicholas your namesake, when he is carved with an axe\r\nfor the headpiece of a Dutch dogger. How dost thou do, Nick, or Pacolet,\r\nif you like that better? Nicholas, here are my two daughters, nearly as\r\nhandsome as thyself thou seest.\"\r\n\r\nNick grinned, and did a clumsy obeisance by way of courtesy, but kept\r\nhis broad misshapen person firmly placed in the doorway.\r\n\r\n\"Daughters,\" continued the Udaller, who seemed to have his reasons for\r\nspeaking this Cerberus fair, at least according to his own notions of\r\npropitiation,--\"this is Nick Strumpfer, maidens, whom his mistress calls\r\nPacolet, being a light-limbed dwarf, as you see, like him that wont to\r\nfly about, like a _Scourie_, on his wooden hobbyhorse, in the old\r\nstorybook of Valentine and Orson, that you, Minna, used to read whilst\r\nyou were a child. I assure you he can keep his mistress's counsel, and\r\nnever told one of her secrets in his life--ha, ha, ha!\"\r\n\r\nThe ugly dwarf grinned ten times wider than before, and showed the\r\nmeaning of the Udaller's jest, by opening his immense jaws, and throwing\r\nback his head, so as to discover, that, in the immense cavity of his\r\nmouth, there only remained the small shrivelled remnant of a tongue,\r\ncapable, perhaps, of assisting him in swallowing his food, but unequal\r\nto the formation of articulate sounds. Whether this organ had been\r\ncurtailed by cruelty, or injured by disease, it was impossible to guess;\r\nbut that the unfortunate being had not been originally dumb, was evident\r\nfrom his retaining the sense of hearing. Having made this horrible\r\nexhibition, he repaid the Udaller's mirth with a loud, horrid, and\r\ndiscordant laugh, which had something in it the more hideous that his\r\nmirth seemed to be excited by his own misery. The sisters looked on each\r\nother in silence and fear, and even the Udaller appeared disconcerted.\r\n\r\n\"And how now?\" he proceeded, after a minute's pause. \"When didst thou\r\nwash that throat of thine, that is about the width of the Pentland\r\nFrith, with a cup of brandy? Ha, Nick! I have that with me which is\r\nsound stuff, boy, ha!\"\r\n\r\nThe dwarf bent his beetle-brows, shook his misshapen head, and made a\r\nquick sharp indication, throwing his right hand up to his shoulder with\r\nthe thumb pointed backwards.\r\n\r\n\"What! my kinswoman,\" said the Udaller, comprehending the signal, \"will\r\nbe angry? Well, shalt have a flask to carouse when she is from home,\r\nold acquaintance;--lips and throats may swallow though they cannot\r\nspeak.\"\r\n\r\nPacolet grinned a grim assent.\r\n\r\n\"And now,\" said the Udaller, \"stand out of the way, Pacolet, and let me\r\ncarry my daughters to see their kinswoman. By the bones of Saint Magnus,\r\nit shall be a good turn in thy way!--nay, never shake thy head, man; for\r\nif thy mistress be at home, see her we will.\"\r\n\r\nThe dwarf again intimated the impossibility of their being admitted,\r\npartly by signs, partly by mumbling some uncouth and most disagreeable\r\nsounds, and the Udaller's mood began to arise.\r\n\r\n\"Tittle tattle, man!\" said he; \"trouble not me with thy gibberish, but\r\nstand out of the way, and the blame, if there be any, shall rest with\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Magnus Troil laid his sturdy hand upon the collar of the\r\nrecusant dwarf's jacket of blue wadmaal, and, with a strong, but not a\r\nviolent grasp, removed him from the doorway, pushed him gently aside,\r\nand entered, followed by his two daughters, whom a sense of\r\napprehension, arising out of all which they saw and heard, kept very\r\nclose to him. A crooked and dusky passage through which Magnus led the\r\nway, was dimly enlightened by a shot-hole, communicating with the\r\ninterior of the building, and originally intended, doubtless, to command\r\nthe entrance by a hagbut or culverin. As they approached nearer, for\r\nthey walked slowly and with hesitation, the light, imperfect as it was,\r\nwas suddenly obscured; and, on looking upward to discern the cause,\r\nBrenda was startled to observe the pale and obscurely-seen countenance\r\nof Norna gazing downward upon them, without speaking a word. There was\r\nnothing extraordinary in this, as the mistress of the mansion might be\r\nnaturally enough looking out to see what guests were thus suddenly and\r\nunceremoniously intruding themselves on her presence. Still, however,\r\nthe natural paleness of her features, exaggerated by the light in which\r\nthey were at present exhibited,--the immovable sternness of her look,\r\nwhich showed neither kindness nor courtesy of civil reception,--her dead\r\nsilence, and the singular appearance of every thing about her dwelling,\r\naugmented the dismay which Brenda had already conceived. Magnus Troil\r\nand Minna had walked slowly forward, without observing the apparition of\r\ntheir singular hostess.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] Note III.--The Pictish Burgh.\r\n\r\n[19] _Jarto_, my dear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n  The witch then raised her wither'd arm,\r\n    And waved her wand on high,\r\n  And, while she spoke the mutter'd charm,\r\n    Dark lightning fill'd her eye.\r\n\r\n                                                     MEIKLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This should be the stair,\" said the Udaller, blundering in the dark\r\nagainst some steps of irregular ascent--\"This should be the stair,\r\nunless my memory greatly fail me; ay, and there she sits,\" he added,\r\npausing at a half-open door, \"with all her tackle about her as usual,\r\nand as busy, doubtless, as the devil in a gale of wind.\"\r\n\r\nAs he made this irreverent comparison, he entered, followed by his\r\ndaughters, the darkened apartment in which Norna was seated, amidst a\r\nconfused collection of books of various languages, parchment scrolls,\r\ntablets and stones inscribed with the straight and angular characters of\r\nthe Runic alphabet, and similar articles, which the vulgar might have\r\nconnected with the exercise of the forbidden arts. There were also lying\r\nin the chamber, or hung over the rude and ill-contrived chimney, an old\r\nshirt of mail, with the headpiece, battle-axe, and lance, which had once\r\nbelonged to it; and on a shelf were disposed, in great order, several of\r\nthose curious stone-axes, formed of green granite, which are often found\r\nin those islands, where they are called thunderbolts by the common\r\npeople, who usually preserve them as a charm of security against the\r\neffects of lightning. There was, moreover, to be seen amid the strange\r\ncollection, a stone sacrificial knife, used perhaps for immolating human\r\nvictims, and one or two of the brazen implements called Celts, the\r\npurpose of which has troubled the repose of so many antiquaries. A\r\nvariety of other articles, some of which had neither name nor were\r\ncapable of description, lay in confusion about the apartment; and in one\r\ncorner, on a quantity of withered sea-weed, reposed what seemed, at\r\nfirst view, to be a large unshapely dog, but, when seen more closely,\r\nproved to be a tame seal, which it had been Norna's amusement to\r\ndomesticate.\r\n\r\nThis uncouth favourite bristled up in its corner, upon the arrival of so\r\nmany strangers, with an alertness similar to that which a terrestrial\r\ndog would have displayed on a similar occasion; but Norna remained\r\nmotionless, seated behind a table of rough granite, propped up by\r\nmisshapen feet of the same material, which, besides the old book with\r\nwhich she seemed to be busied, sustained a cake of the coarse unleavened\r\nbread, three parts oatmeal, and one the sawdust of fir, which is used by\r\nthe poor peasants of Norway, beside which stood a jar of water.\r\n\r\nMagnus Troil remained a minute in silence gazing upon his kinswoman,\r\nwhile the singularity of her mansion inspired Brenda with much fear, and\r\nchanged, though but for a moment, the melancholy and abstracted mood of\r\nMinna, into a feeling of interest not unmixed with awe. The silence was\r\ninterrupted by the Udaller, who, unwilling on the one hand to give his\r\nkinswoman offence, and desirous on the other to show that he was not\r\ndaunted by a reception so singular, opened the conversation thus:--\r\n\r\n\"I give you good e'en, cousin Norna--my daughters and I have come far to\r\nsee you.\"\r\n\r\nNorna raised her eyes from her volume, looked full at her visitors, then\r\nlet them quietly sit down on the leaf with which she seemed to be\r\nengaged.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, cousin,\" said Magnus, \"take your own time--our business with you\r\ncan wait your leisure.--See here, Minna, what a fair prospect here is of\r\nthe cape, scarce a quarter of a mile off! you may see the billows\r\nbreaking on it topmast high. Our kinswoman has got a pretty seal,\r\ntoo--Here, sealchie, my man, whew, whew!\"\r\n\r\nThe seal took no further notice of the Udaller's advances to\r\nacquaintance, than by uttering a low growl.\r\n\r\n\"He is not so well trained,\" continued the Udaller, affecting an air of\r\nease and unconcern, \"as Peter MacRaw's, the old piper of Stornoway, who\r\nhad a seal that flapped its tail to the tune of _Caberfae_, and\r\nacknowledged no other whatever.[20]--Well, cousin,\" he concluded,\r\nobserving that Norna closed her book, \"are you going to give us a\r\nwelcome at last, or must we go farther than our blood-relation's house\r\nto seek one, and that when the evening is wearing late apace?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye dull and hard-hearted generation, as deaf as the adder to the voice\r\nof the charmer,\" answered Norna, addressing them, \"why come ye to me?\r\nYou have slighted every warning I could give of the coming harm, and\r\nnow that it hath come upon you, ye seek my counsel when it can avail you\r\nnothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look you, kinswoman,\" said the Udaller, with his usual frankness, and\r\nboldness of manner and accent, \"I must needs tell you that your courtesy\r\nis something of the coarsest and the coldest. I cannot say that I ever\r\nsaw an adder, in regard there are none in these parts; but touching my\r\nown thoughts of what such a thing may be, it cannot be termed a suitable\r\ncomparison to me or to my daughters, and that I would have you to know.\r\nFor old acquaintance, and certain other reasons, I do not leave your\r\nhouse upon the instant; but as I came hither in all kindness and\r\ncivility, so I pray you to receive me with the like, otherwise we will\r\ndepart, and leave shame on your inhospitable threshold.\"\r\n\r\n\"How,\" said Norna, \"dare you use such bold language in the house of one\r\nfrom whom all men, from whom you yourself, come to solicit counsel and\r\naid? They who speak to the Reimkennar, must lower their voice to her\r\nbefore whom winds and waves hush both blast and billow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Blast and billow may hush themselves if they will,\" replied the\r\nperemptory Udaller, \"but that will not I. I speak in the house of my\r\nfriend as in my own, and strike sail to none.\"\r\n\r\n\"And hope ye,\" said Norna, \"by this rudeness to compel me to answer to\r\nyour interrogatories?\"\r\n\r\n\"Kinswoman,\" replied Magnus Troil, \"I know not so much as you of the old\r\nNorse sagas; but this I know, that when kempies were wont, long since,\r\nto seek the habitations of the gall-dragons and spae-women, they came\r\nwith their axes on their shoulders, and their good swords drawn in their\r\nhands, and compelled the power whom they invoked to listen to and to\r\nanswer them, ay were it Odin himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Kinsman,\" said Norna, arising from her seat, and coming forward, \"thou\r\nhast spoken well, and in good time for thyself and thy daughters; for\r\nhadst thou turned from my threshold without extorting an answer,\r\nmorning's sun had never again shone upon you. The spirits who serve me\r\nare jealous, and will not be employed in aught that may benefit\r\nhumanity, unless their service is commanded by the undaunted importunity\r\nof the brave and the free. And now speak, what wouldst thou have of me?\"\r\n\r\n\"My daughter's health,\" replied Magnus, \"which no remedies have been\r\nable to restore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thy daughter's health?\" answered Norna; \"and what is the maiden's\r\nailment?\"\r\n\r\n\"The physician,\" said Troil, \"must name the disease. All that I can tell\r\nthee of it is\"----\r\n\r\n\"Be silent,\" said Norna, interrupting him, \"I know all thou canst tell\r\nme, and more than thou thyself knowest. Sit down, all of you--and thou,\r\nmaiden,\" she said, addressing Minna, \"sit thou in that chair,\" pointing\r\nto the place she had just left, \"once the seat of Giervada, at whose\r\nvoice the stars hid their beams, and the moon herself grew pale.\"\r\n\r\nMinna moved with slow and tremulous step towards the rude seat thus\r\nindicated to her. It was composed of stone, formed into some semblance\r\nof a chair by the rough and unskilful hand of some ancient Gothic\r\nartist.\r\n\r\nBrenda, creeping as close as possible to her father, seated herself\r\nalong with him upon a bench at some distance from Minna, and kept her\r\neyes, with a mixture of fear, pity, and anxiety, closely fixed upon\r\nher. It would be difficult altogether to decipher the emotions by which\r\nthis amiable and affectionate girl was agitated at the moment. Deficient\r\nin her sister's predominating quality of high imagination, and little\r\ncredulous, of course, to the marvellous, she could not but entertain\r\nsome vague and indefinite fears on her own account, concerning the\r\nnature of the scene which was soon to take place. But these were in a\r\nmanner swallowed up in her apprehensions on the score of her sister,\r\nwho, with a frame so much weakened, spirits so much exhausted, and a\r\nmind so susceptible of the impressions which all around her was\r\ncalculated to excite, now sat pensively resigned to the agency of one,\r\nwhose treatment might produce the most baneful effects upon such a\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nBrenda gazed at Minna, who sat in that rude chair of dark stone, her\r\nfinely formed shape and limbs making the strongest contrast with its\r\nponderous and irregular angles, her cheek and lips as pale as clay, and\r\nher eyes turned upward, and lighted with the mixture of resignation and\r\nexcited enthusiasm, which belonged to her disease and her character. The\r\nyounger sister then looked on Norna, who muttered to herself in a low\r\nmonotonous manner, as, gliding from one place to another, she collected\r\ndifferent articles, which she placed one by one on the table. And\r\nlastly, Brenda looked anxiously to her father, to gather, if possible,\r\nfrom his countenance, whether he entertained any part of her own fears\r\nfor the consequences of the scene which was to ensue, considering the\r\nstate of Minna's health and spirits. But Magnus Troil seemed to have no\r\nsuch apprehensions; he viewed with stern composure Norna's\r\npreparations, and appeared to wait the event with the composure of one,\r\nwho, confiding in the skill of a medical artist, sees him preparing to\r\nenter upon some important and painful operation, in the issue of which\r\nhe is interested by friendship or by affection.\r\n\r\nNorna, meanwhile, went onward with her preparations, until she had\r\nplaced on the stone table a variety of miscellaneous articles, and among\r\nthe rest, a small chafing-dish full of charcoal, a crucible, and a piece\r\nof thin sheet-lead. She then spoke aloud--\"It is well that I was aware\r\nof your coming hither--ay, long before you yourself had resolved it--how\r\nshould I else have been prepared for that which is now to be\r\ndone?--Maiden,\" she continued, addressing Minna, \"where lies thy pain?\"\r\n\r\nThe patient answered, by pressing her hand to the left side of her\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\n\"Even so,\" replied Norna, \"even so--'tis the site of weal or woe.--And\r\nyou, her father and her sister, think not this the idle speech of one\r\nwho talks by guess--if I can tell thee ill, it may be that I shall be\r\nable to render that less severe, which may not, by any aid, be wholly\r\namended.--The heart--ay, the heart--touch that, and the eye grows dim,\r\nthe pulse fails, the wholesome stream of our blood is choked and\r\ntroubled, our limbs decay like sapless sea-weed in a summer's sun; our\r\nbetter views of existence are past and gone; what remains is the dream\r\nof lost happiness, or the fear of inevitable evil. But the Reimkennar\r\nmust to her work--well it is that I have prepared the means.\"\r\n\r\nShe threw off her long dark-coloured mantle, and stood before them in\r\nher short jacket of light-blue wadmaal, with its skirt of the same\r\nstuff, fancifully embroidered with black velvet, and bound at the waist\r\nwith a chain or girdle of silver, formed into singular devices. Norna\r\nnext undid the fillet which bound her grizzled hair, and shaking her\r\nhead wildly, caused it to fall in dishevelled abundance over her face\r\nand around her shoulders, so as almost entirely to hide her features.\r\nShe then placed a small crucible on the chafing-dish already\r\nmentioned,--dropped a few drops from a vial on the charcoal\r\nbelow,--pointed towards it her wrinkled forefinger, which she had\r\npreviously moistened with liquid from another small bottle, and said\r\nwith a deep voice, \"Fire, do thy duty;\"--and the words were no sooner\r\nspoken, than, probably by some chemical combination of which the\r\nspectators were not aware, the charcoal which was under the crucible\r\nbecame slowly ignited; while Norna, as if impatient of the delay, threw\r\nhastily back her disordered tresses, and, while her features reflected\r\nthe sparkles and red light of the fire, and her eyes flashed from\r\namongst her hair like those of a wild animal from its cover, blew\r\nfiercely till the whole was in an intense glow. She paused a moment from\r\nher toil, and muttering that the elemental spirit must be thanked,\r\nrecited, in her usual monotonous, yet wild mode of chanting, the\r\nfollowing verses:--\r\n\r\n  \"Thou so needful, yet so dread,\r\n  With cloudy crest, and wing of red;\r\n  Thou, without whose genial breath\r\n  The North would sleep the sleep of death;\r\n  Who deign'st to warm the cottage hearth,\r\n  Yet hurl'st proud palaces to earth,--\r\n  Brightest, keenest of the Powers,\r\n  Which form and rule this world of ours,\r\n  With my rhyme of Runic, I\r\n  Thank thee for thy agency.\"\r\n\r\nShe then severed a portion from the small mass of sheet-lead which lay\r\nupon the table, and, placing it in the crucible, subjected it to the\r\naction of the lighted charcoal, and, as it melted, she sung,--\r\n\r\n  \"Old Reimkennar, to thy art\r\n  Mother Hertha sends her part;\r\n  She, whose gracious bounty gives\r\n  Needful food for all that lives.\r\n  From the deep mine of the North,\r\n  Came the mystic metal forth,\r\n  Doom'd, amidst disjointed stones,\r\n  Long to cere a champion's bones,\r\n  Disinhumed my charms to aid--\r\n  Mother Earth, my thanks are paid.\"\r\n\r\nShe then poured out some water from the jar into a large cup, or goblet,\r\nand sung once more, as she slowly stirred it round with the end of her\r\nstaff:--\r\n\r\n  \"Girdle of our islands dear,\r\n  Element of Water, hear\r\n  Thou whose power can overwhelm\r\n  Broken mounds and ruin'd realm\r\n      On the lowly Belgian strand;\r\n  All thy fiercest rage can never\r\n  Of our soil a furlong sever\r\n      From our rock-defended land;\r\n  Play then gently thou thy part,\r\n  To assist old Norna's art.\"\r\n\r\nShe then, with a pair of pincers, removed the crucible from the\r\nchafing-dish, and poured the lead, now entirely melted, into the bowl of\r\nwater, repeating at the same time,--\r\n\r\n  \"Elements, each other greeting,\r\n  Gifts and powers attend your meeting!\"\r\n\r\nThe melted lead, spattering as it fell into the water, formed, of\r\ncourse, the usual combination of irregular forms which is familiar to\r\nall who in childhood have made the experiment, and from which, according\r\nto our childish fancy, we may have selected portions bearing some\r\nresemblance to domestic articles--the tools of mechanics, or the like.\r\nNorna seemed to busy herself in some such researches, for she examined\r\nthe mass of lead with scrupulous attention, and detached it into\r\ndifferent portions, without apparently being able to find a fragment in\r\nthe form which she desired.\r\n\r\nAt length she again muttered, rather as speaking to herself than to her\r\nguests, \"He, the Viewless, will not be omitted,--he will have his\r\ntribute even in the work to which he gives nothing.--Stern compeller of\r\nthe clouds, thou also shalt hear the voice of the Reimkennar.\"\r\n\r\nThus speaking, Norna once more threw the lead into the crucible, where,\r\nhissing and spattering as the wet metal touched the sides of the red-hot\r\nvessel, it was soon again reduced into a state of fusion. The sibyl\r\nmeantime turned to a corner of the apartment, and opening suddenly a\r\nwindow which looked to the north-west, let in the fitful radiance of the\r\nsun, now lying almost level upon a great mass of red clouds, which,\r\nboding future tempest, occupied the edge of the horizon, and seemed to\r\nbrood over the billows of the boundless sea. Turning to this quarter,\r\nfrom which a low hollow moaning breeze then blew, Norna addressed the\r\nSpirit of the Winds, in tones which seemed to resemble his own:--\r\n\r\n  \"Thou, that over billows dark\r\n  Safely send'st the fisher's bark,--\r\n  Giving him a path and motion\r\n  Through the wilderness of ocean;\r\n  Thou, that when the billows brave ye,\r\n  O'er the shelves canst drive the navy,--\r\n  Did'st thou chafe as one neglected,\r\n  While thy brethren were respected?\r\n  To appease thee, see, I tear\r\n  This full grasp of grizzled hair;\r\n  Oft thy breath hath through it sung,\r\n  Softening to my magic tongue,--\r\n  Now, 'tis thine to bid it fly\r\n  Through the wide expanse of sky,\r\n  'Mid the countless swarms to sail\r\n  Of wild-fowl wheeling on thy gale;\r\n  Take thy portion and rejoice,--\r\n  Spirit, thou hast heard my voice!\"\r\n\r\nNorna accompanied these words with the action which they described,\r\ntearing a handful of hair with vehemence from her head, and strewing it\r\nupon the wind as she continued her recitation. She then shut the\r\ncasement, and again involved the chamber in the dubious twilight, which\r\nbest suited her character and occupation. The melted lead was once more\r\nemptied into the water, and the various whimsical conformations which it\r\nreceived from the operation were examined with great care by the sibyl,\r\nwho at length seemed to intimate, by voice and gesture, that her spell\r\nhad been successful. She selected from the fused metal a piece about the\r\nsize of a small nut, bearing in shape a close resemblance to that of the\r\nhuman heart, and, approaching Minna, again spoke in song:--\r\n\r\n  \"She who sits by haunted well,\r\n  Is subject to the Nixie's spell;\r\n  She who walks on lonely beach\r\n  To the Mermaid's charmed speech;\r\n  She who walks round ring of green,\r\n  Offends the peevish Fairy Queen;\r\n  And she who takes rest in the Dwarfie's cave,\r\n  A weary weird of woe shall have.\r\n\r\n  \"By ring, by spring, by cave, by shore,\r\n  Minna Troil has braved all this and more:\r\n  And yet hath the root of her sorrow and ill\r\n  A source that's more deep and more mystical still.\"\r\n\r\nMinna, whose attention had been latterly something disturbed by\r\nreflections on her own secret sorrow, now suddenly recalled it, and\r\nlooked eagerly on Norna as if she expected to learn from her rhymes\r\nsomething of deep interest. The northern sibyl, meanwhile, proceeded to\r\npierce the piece of lead, which bore the form of a heart, and to fix in\r\nit a piece of gold wire, by which it might be attached to a chain or\r\nnecklace. She then proceeded in her rhyme,--\r\n\r\n  \"Thou art within a demon's hold,\r\n  More wise than Heims, more strong than Trolld;\r\n  No siren sings so sweet as he,--\r\n  No fay springs lighter on the lea;\r\n  No elfin power hath half the art\r\n  To soothe, to move, to wring the heart,--\r\n  Life-blood from the cheek to drain,\r\n  Drench the eye, and dry the vein.\r\n  Maiden, ere we farther go,\r\n  Dost thou note me, ay or no?\"\r\n\r\nMinna replied in the same rhythmical manner, which, in jest and earnest,\r\nwas frequently used by the ancient Scandinavians,--\r\n\r\n  \"I mark thee, my mother, both word, look, and sign;\r\n  Speak on with the riddle--to read it be mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Heaven and every saint be praised!\" said Magnus; \"they are the\r\nfirst words to the purpose which she hath spoken these many days.\"\r\n\r\n\"And they are the last which she shall speak for many a month,\" said\r\nNorna, incensed at the interruption, \"if you again break the progress of\r\nmy spell. Turn your faces to the wall, and look not hitherward again,\r\nunder penalty of my severe displeasure. You, Magnus Troil, from\r\nhard-hearted audacity of spirit, and you, Brenda, from wanton and idle\r\ndisbelief in that which is beyond your bounded comprehension, are\r\nunworthy to look on this mystic work; and the glance of your eyes\r\nmingles with, and weakens, the spell; for the powers cannot brook\r\ndistrust.\"\r\n\r\nUnaccustomed to be addressed in a tone so peremptory, Magnus would have\r\nmade some angry reply; but reflecting that the health of Minna was at\r\nstake, and considering that she who spoke was a woman of many sorrows,\r\nhe suppressed his anger, bowed his head, shrugged his shoulders, assumed\r\nthe prescribed posture, averting his head from the table, and turning\r\ntowards the wall. Brenda did the same, on receiving a sign from her\r\nfather, and both remained profoundly silent.\r\n\r\nNorna then addressed Minna once more,--\r\n\r\n  \"Mark me! for the word I speak\r\n  Shall bring the colour to thy cheek.\r\n  This leaden heart, so light of cost,\r\n  The symbol of a treasure lost,\r\n  Thou shalt wear in hope and in peace,\r\n  That the cause of your sickness and sorrow may cease,\r\n  When crimson foot meets crimson hand\r\n  In the Martyrs' Aisle, and in Orkney-land.\"\r\n\r\nMinna coloured deeply at the last couplet, intimating, as she failed not\r\nto interpret it, that Norna was completely acquainted with the secret\r\ncause of her sorrow. The same conviction led the maiden to hope in the\r\nfavourable issue, which the sibyl seemed to prophesy; and not venturing\r\nto express her feelings in any manner more intelligible, she pressed\r\nNorna's withered hand with all the warmth of affection, first to her\r\nbreast and then to her bosom, bedewing it at the same time with her\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nWith more of human feeling than she usually exhibited, Norna extricated\r\nher hand from the grasp of the poor girl, whose tears now flowed freely,\r\nand then, with more tenderness of manner than she had yet shown, she\r\nknotted the leaden heart to a chain of gold, and hung it around Minna's\r\nneck, singing, as she performed that last branch of the spell,--\r\n\r\n  \"Be patient, be patient, for Patience hath power\r\n  To ward us in danger, like mantle in shower;\r\n  A fairy gift you best may hold\r\n  In a chain of fairy gold;\r\n  The chain and the gift are each a true token,\r\n  That not without warrant old Norna has spoken;\r\n  But thy nearest and dearest must never behold them,\r\n  Till time shall accomplish the truths I have told them.\"\r\n\r\nThe verses being concluded, Norna carefully arranged the chain around\r\nher patient's neck so as to hide it in her bosom, and thus ended the\r\nspell--a spell which, at the moment I record these incidents, it is\r\nknown, has been lately practised in Zetland, where any decline of\r\nhealth, without apparent cause, is imputed by the lower orders to a\r\ndemon having stolen the heart from the body of the patient, and where\r\nthe experiment of supplying the deprivation by a leaden one, prepared in\r\nthe manner described, has been resorted to within these few years. In a\r\nmetaphorical sense, the disease may be considered as a general one in\r\nall parts of the world; but, as this simple and original remedy is\r\npeculiar to the isles of Thule, it were unpardonable not to preserve it\r\nat length, in a narrative connected with Scottish antiquities.[21]\r\n\r\nA second time Norna reminded her patient, that if she showed, or spoke\r\nof, the fairy gifts, their virtue would be lost--a belief so common as\r\nto be received into the superstitions of all nations. Lastly,\r\nunbuttoning the collar which she had just fastened, she showed her a\r\nlink of the gold chain, which Minna instantly recognised as that\r\nformerly given by Norna to Mordaunt Mertoun. This seemed to intimate he\r\nwas yet alive, and under Norna's protection; and she gazed on her with\r\nthe most eager curiosity. But the sibyl imposed her finger on her lips\r\nin token of silence, and a second time involved the chain in those folds\r\nwhich modestly and closely veiled one of the most beautiful, as well as\r\none of the kindest, bosoms in the world.\r\n\r\nNorna then extinguished the lighted charcoal, and, as the water hissed\r\nupon the glowing embers, commanded Magnus and Brenda to look around, and\r\nbehold her task accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] The MacRaws were followers of the MacKenzies, whose chief has the\r\nname of Caberfae, or Buckshead, from the cognisance borne on his\r\nstandards. Unquestionably the worthy piper trained the seal on the same\r\nprinciple of respect to the clan-term which I have heard has been taught\r\nto dogs, who, unused to any other air, dance after their fashion to the\r\ntune of Caberfae.\r\n\r\n[21] The spells described in this chapter are not altogether imaginary.\r\nBy this mode of pouring lead into water, and selecting the part which\r\nchances to assume a resemblance to the human heart, which must be worn\r\nby the patient around her or his neck, the sage persons of Zetland\r\npretend to cure the fatal disorder called the loss of a heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n  See yonder woman, whom our swains revere,\r\n  And dread in secret, while they take her counsel\r\n  When sweetheart shall be kind, or when cross dame shall die;\r\n  Where lurks the thief who stole the silver tankard,\r\n  And how the pestilent murrain may be cured.--\r\n  This sage adviser's mad, stark mad, my friend;\r\n  Yet, in her madness, hath the art and cunning\r\n  To wring fools' secrets from their inmost bosoms,\r\n  And pay enquirers with the coin they gave her.\r\n\r\n                                                 _Old Play._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if Norna had indeed full right to claim the gratitude of\r\nthe Udaller for the improved condition of his daughter's health. She\r\nonce more threw open the window, and Minna, drying her eyes and\r\nadvancing with affectionate confidence, threw herself on her father's\r\nneck, and asked his forgiveness for the trouble she had of late\r\noccasioned to him. It is unnecessary to add, that this was at once\r\ngranted, with a full, though rough burst of parental tenderness, and as\r\nmany close embraces as if his child had been just rescued from the jaws\r\nof death. When Magnus had dismissed Minna from his arms, to throw\r\nherself into those of her sister, and express to her, rather by kisses\r\nand tears than in words, the regret she entertained for her late wayward\r\nconduct, the Udaller thought proper, in the meantime, to pay his thanks\r\nto their hostess, whose skill had proved so efficacious. But scarce had\r\nhe come out with, \"Much respected kinswoman, I am but a plain old\r\nNorseman,\"--when she interrupted him, by pressing her finger on her\r\nlips.\r\n\r\n\"There are those around us,\" she said, \"who must hear no mortal voice,\r\nwitness no sacrifice to mortal feelings--there are times when they\r\nmutiny even against me, their sovereign mistress, because I am still\r\nshrouded in the flesh of humanity. Fear, therefore, and be silent. I,\r\nwhose deeds have raised me from the low-sheltered valley of life, where\r\ndwell its social wants and common charities;--I, who have bereft the\r\nGiver of the Gift which he gave, and stand alone on a cliff of\r\nimmeasurable height, detached from earth, save from the small portion\r\nthat supports my miserable tread--I alone am fit to cope with those\r\nsullen mates. Fear not, therefore, but yet be not too bold, and let this\r\nnight to you be one of fasting and of prayer.\"\r\n\r\nIf the Udaller had not, before the commencement of the operation, been\r\ndisposed to dispute the commands of the sibyl, it may be well believed\r\nhe was less so now, that it had terminated to all appearance so\r\nfortunately. So he sat down in silence, and seized upon a volume which\r\nlay near him as a sort of desperate effort to divert ennui, for on no\r\nother occasion had Magnus been known to have recourse to a book for that\r\npurpose. It chanced to be a book much to his mind, being the well-known\r\nwork of Olaus Magnus, upon the manners of the ancient Northern nations.\r\nThe book is unluckily in the Latin language, and the Danske or Dutch\r\nwere, either of them, much more familiar to the Udaller. But then it was\r\nthe fine edition published in 1555, which contains representations of\r\nthe war-chariots, fishing exploits, warlike exercises, and domestic\r\nemployments of the Scandinavians, executed on copper-plates; and thus\r\nthe information which the work refused to the understanding, was\r\naddressed to the eye, which, as is well known both to old and young,\r\nanswers the purpose of amusement as well, if not better.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the two sisters, pressed as close to each other as two flowers\r\non the same stalk, sat with their arms reciprocally passed over each\r\nother's shoulder, as if they feared some new and unforeseen cause of\r\ncoldness was about to separate them, and interrupt the sister-like\r\nharmony which had been but just restored. Norna sat opposite to them,\r\nsometimes revolving the large parchment volume with which they had found\r\nher employed at their entrance, and sometimes gazing on the sisters with\r\na fixed look, in which an interest of a kind unusually tender, seemed\r\noccasionally to disturb the stern and rigorous solemnity of her\r\ncountenance. All was still and silent as death, and the subsiding\r\nemotions of Brenda had not yet permitted her to wonder whether the\r\nremaining hours of the evening were to be passed in the same manner,\r\nwhen the scene of tranquillity was suddenly interrupted by the entrance\r\nof the dwarf Pacolet, or, as the Udaller called him, Nicholas Strumpfer.\r\n\r\nNorna darted an angry glance on the intruder, who seemed to deprecate\r\nher resentment by holding up his hands and uttering a babbling sound;\r\nthen, instantly resorting to his usual mode of conversation, he\r\nexpressed himself by a variety of signs made rapidly upon his fingers,\r\nand as rapidly answered by his mistress, so that the young women, who\r\nhad never heard of such an art, and now saw it practised by two beings\r\nso singular, almost conceived their mutual intelligence the work of\r\nenchantment. When they had ceased their intercourse, Norna turned to\r\nMagnus Troil with much haughtiness, and said, \"How, my kinsman? have you\r\nso far forgot yourself, as to bring earthly food into the house of the\r\nReimkennar, and make preparations in the dwelling of Power and of\r\nDespair, for refection, and wassail, and revelry?--Speak not--answer\r\nnot,\" she said; \"the duration of the cure which was wrought even now,\r\ndepends on your silence and obedience--bandy but a single look or word\r\nwith me, and the latter condition of that maiden shall be worse than the\r\nfirst!\"\r\n\r\nThis threat was an effectual charm upon the tongue of the Udaller,\r\nthough he longed to indulge it in vindication of his conduct.\r\n\r\n\"Follow me, all of you,\" said Norna, striding to the door of the\r\napartment, \"and see that no one looks backwards--we leave not this\r\napartment empty, though we, the children of mortality, be removed from\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nShe went out, and the Udaller signed to his daughters to follow, and to\r\nobey her injunctions. The sibyl moved swifter than her guests down the\r\nrude descent, (such it might rather be termed, than a proper staircase,)\r\nwhich led to the lower apartment. Magnus and his daughters, when they\r\nentered the chamber, found their own attendants aghast at the presence\r\nand proceedings of Norna of the Fitful-head.\r\n\r\nThey had been previously employed in arranging the provisions which they\r\nhad brought along with them, so as to present a comfortable cold meal,\r\nas soon as the appetite of the Udaller, which was as regular as the\r\nreturn of tide, should induce him to desire some refreshment; and now\r\nthey stood staring in fear and surprise, while Norna, seizing upon one\r\narticle after another, and well supported by the zealous activity of\r\nPacolet, flung their whole preparations out of the rude aperture which\r\nserved for a window, and over the cliff, from which the ancient Burgh\r\narose, into the ocean, which raged and foamed beneath. _Vifda_, (dried\r\nbeef,) hams, and pickled pork, flew after each other into empty space,\r\nsmoked geese were restored to the air, and cured fish to the sea, their\r\nnative elements indeed, but which they were no longer capable of\r\ntraversing; and the devastation proceeded so rapidly, that the Udaller\r\ncould scarce secure from the wreck his silver drinking cup; while the\r\nlarge leathern flask of brandy, which was destined to supply his\r\nfavourite beverage, was sent to follow the rest of the supper, by the\r\nhands of Pacolet, who regarded, at the same time, the disappointed\r\nUdaller with a malicious grin, as if, notwithstanding his own natural\r\ntaste for the liquor, he enjoyed the disappointment and surprise of\r\nMagnus Troil still more than he would have relished sharing his\r\nenjoyment.\r\n\r\nThe destruction of the brandy flask exhausted the patience of Magnus,\r\nwho roared out, in a tone of no small displeasure, \"Why, kinswoman, this\r\nis wasteful madness--where, and on what, would you have us sup?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where you will,\" answered Norna, \"and on what you will--but not in my\r\ndwelling, and not on the food with which you have profaned it. Vex my\r\nspirit no more, but begone every one of you! You have been here too long\r\nfor my good, perhaps for your own.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, kinswoman,\" said Magnus, \"would you make outcasts of us at this\r\ntime of night, when even a Scotchman would not turn a stranger from the\r\ndoor?--Bethink you, dame, it is shame on our lineage for ever, if this\r\nsquall of yours should force us to slip cables, and go to sea so\r\nscantily provided.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be silent, and depart,\" said Norna; \"let it suffice you have got that\r\nfor which you came. I have no harbourage for mortal guests, no provision\r\nto relieve human wants. There is beneath the cliff, a beach of the\r\nfinest sand, a stream of water as pure as the well of Kildinguie, and\r\nthe rocks bear dulse as wholesome as that of Guiodin; and well you wot,\r\nthat the well of Kildinguie and the dulse of Guiodin will cure all\r\nmaladies save Black Death.\"[22]\r\n\r\n\"And well I wot,\" said the Udaller, \"that I would eat corrupted\r\nsea-weeds like a starling, or salted seal's flesh like the men of\r\nBurraforth, or wilks, buckies, and lampits, like the poor sneaks of\r\nStroma, rather than break wheat bread and drink red wine in a house\r\nwhere it is begrudged me.--And yet,\" he said, checking himself, \"I am\r\nwrong, very wrong, my cousin, to speak thus to you, and I should rather\r\nthank you for what you have done, than upbraid you for following your\r\nown ways. But I see you are impatient--we will be all under way\r\npresently.--And you, ye knaves,\" addressing his servants, \"that were in\r\nsuch hurry with your service before it was lacked, get out of doors with\r\nyou presently, and manage to catch the ponies; for I see we must make\r\nfor another harbour to-night, if we would not sleep with an empty\r\nstomach, and on a hard bed.\"\r\n\r\nThe domestics of Magnus, already sufficiently alarmed at the violence of\r\nNorna's conduct, scarce waited the imperious command of their master to\r\nevacuate her dwelling with all dispatch; and the Udaller, with a\r\ndaughter on each arm, was in the act of following them, when Norna said\r\nemphatically, \"Stop!\" They obeyed, and again turned towards her. She\r\nheld out her hand to Magnus, which the placable Udaller instantly folded\r\nin his own ample palm.\r\n\r\n\"Magnus,\" she said, \"we part by necessity, but, I trust, not in anger?\"\r\n\r\n\"Surely not, cousin,\" said the warm-hearted Udaller, wellnigh stammering\r\nin his hasty disclamation of all unkindness,--\"most assuredly not. I\r\nnever bear ill-will to any one, much less to one of my own blood, and\r\nwho has piloted me with her advice through many a rough tide, as I would\r\npilot a boat betwixt Swona and Stroma, through all the waws, wells, and\r\nswelchies of the Pentland Frith.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough,\" said Norna, \"and now farewell, with such a blessing as I dare\r\nbestow--not a word more!--Maidens,\" she added, \"draw near, and let me\r\nkiss your brows.\"\r\n\r\nThe sibyl was obeyed by Minna with awe, and by Brenda with fear; the one\r\novermastered by the warmth of her imagination, the other by the natural\r\ntimidity of her constitution. Norna then dismissed them, and in two\r\nminutes afterwards they found themselves beyond the bridge, and standing\r\nupon the rocky platform in front of the ancient Pictish Burgh, which it\r\nwas the pleasure of this sequestered female to inhabit. The night, for\r\nit was now fallen, was unusually serene. A bright twilight, which\r\nglimmered far over the surface of the sea, supplied the brief absence of\r\nthe summer's sun; and the waves seemed to sleep under its influence, so\r\nfaint and slumberous was the sound with which one after another rolled\r\non and burst against the foot of the cliff on which they stood. In front\r\nof them stood the rugged fortress, seeming, in the uniform greyness of\r\nthe atmosphere, as aged, as shapeless, and as massive, as the rock on\r\nwhich it was founded. There was neither sight nor sound that indicated\r\nhuman habitation, save that from one rude shot-hole glimmered the flame\r\nof the feeble lamp by which the sibyl was probably pursuing her mystical\r\nand nocturnal studies, shooting upon the twilight, in which it was soon\r\nlost and confounded, a single line of tiny light; bearing the same\r\nproportion to that of the atmosphere, as the aged woman and her serf,\r\nthe sole inhabitants of that desert, did to the solitude with which they\r\nwere surrounded.\r\n\r\nFor several minutes, the party, thus suddenly and unexpectedly expelled\r\nfrom the shelter where they had reckoned upon spending the night, stood\r\nin silence, each wrapt in their own separate reflections. Minna, her\r\nthoughts fixed on the mystical consolation which she had received, in\r\nvain endeavoured to extract from the words of Norna a more distinct and\r\nintelligible meaning; and the Udaller had not yet recovered his surprise\r\nat the extrusion to which he had been thus whimsically subjected, under\r\ncircumstances that prohibited him from resenting as an insult,\r\ntreatment, which, in all other respects, was so shocking to the genial\r\nhospitality of his nature, that he still felt like one disposed to be\r\nangry, if he but knew how to set about it. Brenda was the first who\r\nbrought matters to a point, by asking whither they were to go, and how\r\nthey were to spend the night? The question, which was asked in a tone,\r\nthat, amidst its simplicity, had something dolorous in it, entirely\r\nchanged the train of her father's ideas; and the unexpected perplexity\r\nof their situation now striking him in a comic point of view, he laughed\r\ntill his very eyes ran over, while every rock around him rang, and the\r\nsleeping sea-fowl were startled from their repose, by the loud, hearty\r\nexplosions of his obstreperous hilarity.\r\n\r\nThe Udaller's daughters, eagerly representing to their father the risk\r\nof displeasing Norna by this unlimited indulgence of his mirth, united\r\ntheir efforts to drag him to a farther distance from her dwelling.\r\nMagnus, yielding to their strength, which, feeble as it was, his own fit\r\nof laughter rendered him incapable of resisting, suffered himself to be\r\npulled to a considerable distance from the Burgh, and then escaping from\r\ntheir hands, and sitting down, or rather suffering himself to drop, upon\r\na large stone which lay conveniently by the wayside, he again laughed so\r\nlong and lustily, that his vexed and anxious daughters became afraid\r\nthat there was something more than natural in these repeated\r\nconvulsions.\r\n\r\nAt length his mirth exhausted both itself and the Udaller's strength. He\r\ngroaned heavily, wiped his eyes, and said, not without feeling some\r\ndesire to renew his obstreperous cachinnation, \"Now, by the bones of\r\nSaint Magnus, my ancestor and namesake, one would imagine that being\r\nturned out of doors, at this time of night, was nothing short of an\r\nabsolutely exquisite jest; for I have shaken my sides at it till they\r\nache. There we sat, made snug for the night, and I made as sure of a\r\ngood supper and a can as ever I had been of either,--and here we are all\r\ntaken aback! and then poor Brenda's doleful voice, and melancholy\r\nquestion, of 'What is to be done, and where are we to sleep?' In good\r\nfaith, unless one of those knaves, who must needs torment the poor woman\r\nby their trencher-work before it was wanted, can make amends by telling\r\nus of some snug port under our lee, we have no other course for it but\r\nto steer through the twilight on the bearing of Burgh-Westra, and rough\r\nit out as well as we can by the way. I am sorry but for you, girls; for\r\nmany a cruize have I been upon when we were on shorter allowance than we\r\nare like to have now.--I would I had but secured a morsel for you, and a\r\ndrop for myself; and then there had been but little to complain of.\"\r\n\r\nBoth sisters hastened to assure the Udaller that they felt not the least\r\noccasion for food.\r\n\r\n\"Why, that is well,\" said Magnus: \"and so being the case, I will not\r\ncomplain of my own appetite, though it is sharper than convenient. And\r\nthe rascal, Nicholas Strumpfer,--what a leer the villain gave me as he\r\nstarted the good Nantz into the salt-water! He grinned, the knave, like\r\na seal on a skerry.--Had it not been for vexing my poor kinswoman Norna,\r\nI would have sent his misbegotten body, and misshapen jolterhead, after\r\nmy bonny flask, as sure as Saint Magnus lies at Kirkwall!\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the servants returned with the ponies, which they had very\r\nsoon caught--these sensible animals finding nothing so captivating in\r\nthe pastures where they had been suffered to stray, as inclined them to\r\nresist the invitation again to subject themselves to saddle and bridle.\r\nThe prospects of the party were also considerably improved by learning\r\nthat the contents of their sumpter-pony's burden had not been entirely\r\nexhausted,--a small basket having fortunately escaped the rage of Norna\r\nand Pacolet, by the rapidity with which one of the servants had caught\r\nup and removed it. The same domestic, an alert and ready-witted fellow,\r\nhad observed upon the beach, not above three miles distant from the\r\nBurgh, and about a quarter of a mile off their straight path, a deserted\r\n_Skio_, or fisherman's hut, and suggested that they should occupy it for\r\nthe rest of the night, in order that the ponies might be refreshed, and\r\nthe young ladies spend the night under cover from the raw evening air.\r\n\r\nWhen we are delivered from great and serious dangers, our mood is, or\r\nought to be, grave, in proportion to the peril we have escaped, and the\r\ngratitude due to protecting Providence. But few things raise the spirits\r\nmore naturally, or more harmlessly, than when means of extrication from\r\nany of the lesser embarrassments of life are suddenly presented to us;\r\nand such was the case in the present instance. The Udaller, relieved\r\nfrom the apprehensions for his daughters suffering from fatigue, and\r\nhimself from too much appetite and too little food, carolled Norse\r\nditties, as he spurred Bergen through the twilight, with as much glee\r\nand gallantry as if the night-ride had been entirely a matter of his own\r\nfree choice. Brenda lent her voice to some of his choruses, which were\r\nechoed in ruder notes by the servants, who, in that simple state of\r\nsociety, were not considered as guilty of any breach of respect by\r\nmingling their voices with the song. Minna, indeed, was as yet unequal\r\nto such an effort; but she compelled herself to assume some share in the\r\ngeneral hilarity of the meeting; and, contrary to her conduct since the\r\nfatal morning which concluded the Festival of Saint John, she seemed to\r\ntake her usual interest in what was going on around her, and answered\r\nwith kindness and readiness the repeated enquiries concerning her\r\nhealth, with which the Udaller every now and then interrupted his carol.\r\nAnd thus they proceeded by night, a happier party by far than they had\r\nbeen when they traced the same route on the preceding morning, making\r\nlight of the difficulties of the way, and promising themselves shelter\r\nand a comfortable night's rest in the deserted hut which they were now\r\nabout to approach, and which they expected to find in a state of\r\ndarkness and solitude.\r\n\r\nBut it was the lot of the Udaller that day to be deceived more than once\r\nin his calculations.\r\n\r\n\"And which way lies this cabin of yours, Laurie?\" said the Udaller,\r\naddressing the intelligent domestic of whom we just spoke.\r\n\r\n\"Yonder it should be,\" said Laurence Scholey, \"at the head of the\r\nvoe--but, by my faith, if it be the place, there are folk there before\r\nus--God and Saint Ronan send that they be canny company!\"\r\n\r\nIn truth there was a light in the deserted hut, strong enough to glimmer\r\nthrough every chink of the shingles and wreck-wood of which it was\r\nconstructed, and to give the whole cabin the appearance of a smithy seen\r\nby night. The universal superstition of the Zetlanders seized upon\r\nMagnus and his escort.\r\n\r\n\"They are trows,\" said one voice.\r\n\r\n\"They are witches,\" murmured another.\r\n\r\n\"They are mermaids,\" muttered a third; \"only hear their wild singing!\"\r\n\r\nAll stopped; and, in effect, some notes of music were audible, which\r\nBrenda, with a voice that quivered a little, but yet had a turn of arch\r\nridicule in its tone, pronounced to be the sound of a fiddle.\r\n\r\n\"Fiddle or fiend,\" said the Udaller, who, if he believed in such nightly\r\napparitions as had struck terror into his retinue, certainly feared them\r\nnot--\"fiddle or fiend, may the devil fetch me if a witch cheats me out\r\nof supper to-night, for the second time!\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he dismounted, clenched his trusty truncheon in his hand, and\r\nadvanced towards the hut, followed by Laurence alone; the rest of his\r\nretinue continuing stationary on the beach beside his daughters and the\r\nponies.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[22] So at least says an Orkney proverb.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n  What ho, my jovial mates! come on! we'll frolic it\r\n  Like fairies frisking in the merry moonshine,\r\n  Seen by the curtal friar, who, from some christening\r\n  Or some blithe bridal, hies belated cell-ward--\r\n  He starts, and changes his bold bottle swagger\r\n  To churchman's pace professional, and, ransacking\r\n  His treacherous memory for some holy hymn,\r\n  Finds but the roundel of the midnight catch.\r\n\r\n                                                 _Old Play._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stride of the Udaller relaxed nothing of its length or of its\r\nfirmness as he approached the glimmering cabin, from which he now heard\r\ndistinctly the sound of the fiddle. But, if still long and firm, his\r\nsteps succeeded each other rather more slowly than usual; for, like a\r\ncautious, though a brave general, Magnus was willing to reconnoitre his\r\nenemy before assailing him. The trusty Laurence Scholey, who kept close\r\nbehind his master, now whispered into his ear, \"So help me, sir, as I\r\nbelieve that the ghaist, if ghaist it be, that plays so bravely on the\r\nfiddle, must be the ghaist of Maister Claud Halcro, or his wraith at\r\nleast; for never was bow drawn across thairm which brought out the gude\r\nauld spring of 'Fair and Lucky,' so like his ain.\"\r\n\r\nMagnus was himself much of the same opinion; for he knew the blithe\r\nminstrelsy of the spirited little old man, and hailed the hut with a\r\nhearty hilloah, which was immediately replied to by the cheery note of\r\nhis ancient messmate, and Halcro himself presently made his appearance\r\non the beach.\r\n\r\nThe Udaller now signed to his retinue to come up, while he asked his\r\nfriend, after a kind greeting and much shaking of hands, \"How the devil\r\nhe came to sit there, playing old tunes in so desolate a place, like an\r\nowl whooping to the moon?\"\r\n\r\n\"And tell me rather, Fowd,\" said Claud Halcro, \"how you came to be\r\nwithin hearing of me? ay, by my word, and with your bonny daughters,\r\ntoo?--Jarto Minna and Jarto Brenda, I bid you welcome to these yellow\r\nsands--and there shake hands, as glorious John, or some other body,\r\nsays, upon the same occasion. And how came you here like two fair swans,\r\nmaking day out of twilight, and turning all you step upon to silver?\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall know all about them presently,\" answered Magnus; \"but what\r\nmessmates have you got in the hut with you? I think I hear some one\r\nspeaking.\"\r\n\r\n\"None,\" replied Claud Halcro, \"but that poor creature, the Factor, and\r\nmy imp of a boy Giles. I--but come in--come in--here you will find us\r\nstarving in comfort--not so much as a mouthful of sour sillocks to be\r\nhad for love or money.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be in a small part helped,\" said the Udaller; \"for though the\r\nbest of our supper is gone over the Fitful Crags to the sealchies and\r\nthe dog-fish, yet we have got something in the kit still.--Here, Laurie,\r\nbring up the _vifda_.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Jokul, jokul!_\"[23] was Laurence's joyful answer; and he hastened for\r\nthe basket.\r\n\r\n\"By the bicker of Saint Magnus,\"[24] said Halcro, \"and the burliest\r\nbishop that ever quaffed it for luck's sake, there is no finding your\r\nlocker empty, Magnus! I believe sincerely that ere a friend wanted, you\r\ncould, like old Luggie the warlock, fish up boiled and roasted out of\r\nthe pool of Kibster.\"[25]\r\n\r\n\"You are wrong there, Jarto Claud,\" said Magnus Troil, \"for far from\r\nhelping me to a supper, the foul fiend, I believe, has carried off great\r\npart of mine this blessed evening; but you are welcome to share and\r\nshare of what is left.\" This was said while the party entered the hut.\r\n\r\nHere, in a cabin which smelled strongly of dried fish, and whose sides\r\nand roof were jet-black with smoke, they found the unhappy Triptolemus\r\nYellowley seated beside a fire made of dried sea-weed, mingled with some\r\npeats and wreck-wood; his sole companion a barefooted, yellow-haired\r\nZetland boy, who acted occasionally as a kind of page to Claud Halcro,\r\nbearing his fiddle on his shoulder, saddling his pony, and rendering him\r\nsimilar duties of kindly observance. The disconsolate agriculturist, for\r\nsuch his visage betokened him, displayed little surprise, and less\r\nanimation, at the arrival of the Udaller and his companions, until,\r\nafter the party had drawn close to the fire, (a neighbourhood which the\r\ndampness of the night air rendered far from disagreeable,) the pannier\r\nwas opened, and a tolerable supply of barley-bread and hung beef,\r\nbesides a flask of brandy, (no doubt smaller than that which the\r\nrelentless hand of Pacolet had emptied into the ocean,) gave assurances\r\nof a tolerable supper. Then, indeed, the worthy Factor grinned,\r\nchuckled, rubbed his hands, and enquired after all friends at\r\nBurgh-Westra.\r\n\r\nWhen they had all partaken of this needful refreshment, the Udaller\r\nrepeated his enquiries of Halcro, and more particularly of the Factor,\r\nhow they came to be nestled in such a remote corner at such an hour of\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\"Maister Magnus Troil,\" said Triptolemus, when a second cup had given\r\nhim spirits to tell his tale of woe, \"I would not have you think that it\r\nis a little thing that disturbs me. I came of that grain that takes a\r\nsair wind to shake it. I have seen many a Martinmas and many a\r\nWhitsunday in my day, whilk are the times peculiarly grievous to those\r\nof my craft, and I could aye bide the bang; but I think I am like to be\r\ndung ower a'thegither in this damned country of yours--Gude forgie me\r\nfor swearing--but evil communication corrupteth good manners.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Heaven guide us,\" said the Udaller, \"what is the matter with the\r\nman? Why, man, if you will put your plough into new land, you must look\r\nto have it hank on a stone now and then--You must set us an example of\r\npatience, seeing you come here for our improvement.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the deil was in my feet when I did so,\" said the Factor; \"I had\r\nbetter have set myself to improve the cairn on Clochnaben.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is it, after all,\" said the Udaller, \"that has befallen\r\nyou?--what is it that you complain of?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of every thing that has chanced to me since I landed on this island,\r\nwhich I believe was accursed at the very creation,\" said the\r\nagriculturist, \"and assigned as a fitting station for sorners, thieves,\r\nwhores, (I beg the ladies' pardon,) witches, bitches, and all evil\r\nspirits!\"\r\n\r\n\"By my faith, a goodly catalogue!\" said Magnus; \"and there has been the\r\nday, that if I had heard you give out the half of it, I should have\r\nturned improver myself, and have tried to amend your manners with a\r\ncudgel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bear with me,\" said the Factor, \"Maister Fowd, or Maister Udaller, or\r\nwhatever else they may call you, and as you are strong be pitiful, and\r\nconsider the luckless lot of any inexperienced person who lights upon\r\nthis earthly paradise of yours. He asks for drink, they bring him sour\r\nwhey--no disparagement to your brandy, Fowd, which is excellent--You ask\r\nfor meat, and they bring you sour sillocks that Satan might choke\r\nupon--You call your labourers together, and bid them work; it proves\r\nSaint Magnus's day, or Saint Ronan's day, or some infernal saint or\r\nother's--or else, perhaps, they have come out of bed with the wrong foot\r\nforemost, or they have seen an owl, or a rabbit has crossed their path,\r\nor they have dreamed of a roasted horse--in short, nothing is to be\r\ndone--Give them a spade, and they work as if it burned their fingers;\r\nbut set them to dancing, and see when they will tire of funking and\r\nflinging!\"\r\n\r\n\"And why should they, poor bodies,\" said Claud Halcro, \"as long as there\r\nare good fiddlers to play to them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay,\" said Triptolemus, shaking his head, \"you are a proper person\r\nto uphold them in such a humour. Well, to proceed:--I till a piece of\r\nmy best ground; down comes a sturdy beggar that wants a kailyard, or a\r\nplant-a-cruive, as you call it, and he claps down an enclosure in the\r\nmiddle of my bit shot of corn, as lightly as if he was baith laird and\r\ntenant; and gainsay him wha likes, there he dibbles in his kail-plants!\r\nI sit down to my sorrowful dinner, thinking to have peace and quietness\r\nthere at least; when in comes one, two, three, four, or half-a-dozen of\r\nskelping long lads, from some foolery or anither, misca' me for barring\r\nmy ain door against them, and eat up the best half of what my sister's\r\nprovidence--and she is not over bountiful--has allotted for my dinner!\r\nThen enters a witch, with an ellwand in her hand, and she raises the\r\nwind or lays it, whichever she likes, majors up and down my house as if\r\nshe was mistress of it, and I am bounden to thank Heaven if she carries\r\nnot the broadside of it away with her!\"\r\n\r\n\"Still,\" said the Fowd, \"this is no answer to my question--how the foul\r\nfiend I come to find you at moorings here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Have patience, worthy sir,\" replied the afflicted Factor, \"and listen\r\nto what I have to say, for I fancy it will be as well to tell you the\r\nwhole matter. You must know, I once thought that I had gotten a small\r\ngodsend, that might have made all these matters easier.\"\r\n\r\n\"How! a godsend! Do you mean a wreck, Master Factor?\" exclaimed Magnus;\r\n\"shame upon you, that should have set example to others!\"\r\n\r\n\"It was no wreck,\" said the Factor; \"but, if you must needs know, it\r\nchanced that as I raised an hearthstane in one of the old chambers at\r\nStourburgh, (for my sister is minded that there is little use in mair\r\nfire-places about a house than one, and I wanted the stane to knock bear\r\nupon,) when, what should I light on but a horn full of old coins, silver\r\nthe maist feck of them, but wi' a bit sprinkling of gold amang them\r\ntoo.[26] Weel, I thought this was a dainty windfa', and so thought Baby,\r\nand we were the mair willing to put up with a place where there were\r\nsiccan braw nest-eggs--and we slade down the stane cannily over the\r\nhorn, which seemed to me to be the very cornucopia, or horn of\r\nabundance; and for further security, Baby wad visit the room maybe\r\ntwenty times in the day, and mysell at an orra time, to the boot of a'\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"On my word, and a very pretty amusement,\" said Claud Halcro, \"to look\r\nover a horn of one's own siller. I question if glorious John Dryden ever\r\nenjoyed such a pastime in his life--I am very sure I never did.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but you forget, Jarto Claud,\" said the Udaller, \"that the Factor\r\nwas only counting over the money for my Lord the Chamberlain. As he is\r\nso keen for his Lordship's rights in whales and wrecks, he would not\r\nsurely forget him in treasure-trove.\"\r\n\r\n\"A-hem! a-hem! a-he--he--hem!\" ejaculated Triptolemus, seized at the\r\nmoment with an awkward fit of coughing,--\"no doubt, my Lord's right in\r\nthe matter would have been considered, being in the hand of one, though\r\nI say it, as just as can be found in Angus-shire, let alone the Mearns.\r\nBut mark what happened of late! One day, as I went up to see that all\r\nwas safe and snug, and just to count out the share that should have been\r\nhis Lordship's--for surely the labourer, as one may call the finder, is\r\nworthy of his hire--nay, some learned men say, that when the finder, in\r\npoint of trust and in point of power, representeth the _dominus_, or\r\nlord superior, he taketh the whole; but let that pass, as a kittle\r\nquestion _in apicibus juris_, as we wont to say at Saint Andrews--Well,\r\nsir and ladies, when I went to the upper chamber, what should I see but\r\nan ugsome, ill-shaped, and most uncouth dwarf, that wanted but hoofs and\r\nhorns to have made an utter devil of him, counting over the very hornful\r\nof siller! I am no timorous man, Master Fowd, but, judging that I should\r\nproceed with caution in such a matter--for I had reason to believe that\r\nthere was devilry in it--I accosted him in Latin, (whilk it is maist\r\nbecoming to speak to aught whilk taketh upon it as a goblin,) and\r\nconjured him _in nomine_, and so forth, with such words as my poor\r\nlearning could furnish of a suddenty, whilk, to say truth, were not so\r\nmany, nor altogether so purely latineezed as might have been, had I not\r\nbeen few years at college, and many at the pleugh. Well, sirs, he\r\nstarted at first, as one that heareth that which he expects not; but\r\npresently recovering himself, he wawls on me with his grey een, like a\r\nwild-cat, and opens his mouth, whilk resembled the mouth of an oven, for\r\nthe deil a tongue he had in it, that I could spy, and took upon his ugly\r\nself, altogether the air and bearing of a bull-dog, whilk I have seen\r\nloosed at a fair upon a mad staig;[27] whereupon I was something\r\ndaunted, and withdrew myself to call upon sister Baby, who fears neither\r\ndog nor devil, when there is in question the little penny siller. And\r\ntruly she raise to the fray as I hae seen the Lindsays and Ogilvies\r\nbristle up, when Donald MacDonnoch, or the like, made a start down frae\r\nthe Highlands on the braes of Islay. But an auld useless carline, called\r\nTronda Dronsdaughter, (they might call her Drone the sell of her,\r\nwithout farther addition,) flung herself right in my sister's gate, and\r\nyelloched and skirled, that you would have thought her a whole\r\ngeneration of hounds; whereupon I judged it best to make ae yoking of\r\nit, and stop the pleugh until I got my sister's assistance. Whilk when I\r\nhad done, and we mounted the stair to the apartment in which the said\r\ndwarf, devil, or other apparition, was to be seen, dwarf, horn, and\r\nsiller, were as clean gane as if the cat had lickit the place where I\r\nsaw them.\"\r\n\r\nHere Triptolemus paused in his extraordinary narration, while the rest\r\nof the party looked upon each other in surprise, and the Udaller\r\nmuttered to Claud Halcro--\"By all tokens, this must have been either the\r\ndevil or Nicholas Strumpfer; and if it were him, he is more of a goblin\r\nthan e'er I gave him credit for, and shall be apt to rate him as such in\r\nfuture.\" Then, addressing the Factor, he enquired--\"Saw ye nought how\r\nthis dwarf of yours parted company?\"\r\n\r\n\"As I shall answer it, no,\" replied Triptolemus, with a cautious look\r\naround him, as if daunted by the recollection; \"neither I, nor Baby, who\r\nhad her wits more about her, not having seen this unseemly vision, could\r\nperceive any way by whilk he made evasion. Only Tronda said she saw him\r\nflee forth of the window of the west roundel of the auld house, upon a\r\ndragon, as she averred. But, as the dragon is held a fabulous animal, I\r\nsuld pronounce her averment to rest upon _deceptio visus_.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, may we not ask farther,\" said Brenda, stimulated by curiosity to\r\nknow as much of her cousin Norna's family as was possible, \"how all this\r\noperated upon Master Yellowley, so as to occasion his being in this\r\nplace at so unseasonable an hour?\"\r\n\r\n\"Seasonable it must be, Mistress Brenda, since it brought us into your\r\nsweet company,\" answered Claud Halcro, whose mercurial brain far\r\noutstripped the slow conceptions of the agriculturist, and who became\r\nimpatient of being so long silent. \"To say the truth, it was I, Mistress\r\nBrenda, who recommended to our friend the Factor, whose house I chanced\r\nto call at just after this mischance, (and where, by the way, owing\r\ndoubtless to the hurry of their spirits, I was but poorly received,) to\r\nmake a visit to our other friend at Fitful-head, well judging from\r\ncertain points of the story, at which my other and more particular\r\nfriend than either\" (looking at Magnus) \"may chance to form a guess,\r\nthat they who break a head are the best to find a plaster. And as our\r\nfriend the Factor scrupled travelling on horseback, in respect of some\r\ntumbles from our ponies\"----\r\n\r\n\"Which are incarnate devils,\" said Triptolemus, aloud, muttering under\r\nhis breath, \"like every live thing that I have found in Zetland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Fowd,\" continued Halcro, \"I undertook to carry him to Fitful-head\r\nin my little boat, which Giles and I can manage as if it were an\r\nAdmiral's barge full manned; and Master Triptolemus Yellowley will tell\r\nyou how seaman-like I piloted him to the little haven, within a quarter\r\nof a mile of Norna's dwelling.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish to Heaven you had brought me as safe back again,\" said the\r\nFactor.\r\n\r\n\"Why, to be sure,\" replied the minstrel, \"I am, as glorious John says,--\r\n\r\n  'A daring pilot in extremity,\r\n  Pleased with the danger when the waves go high,\r\n  I seek the storm--but, for a calm unfit,\r\n  Will steer too near the sands, to show my wit.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I showed little wit in intrusting myself to your charge,\" said\r\nTriptolemus; \"and you still less when you upset the boat at the throat\r\nof the voe, as you call it, when even the poor bairn, that was mair than\r\nhalf drowned, told you that you were carrying too much sail; and then ye\r\nwad fasten the rape to the bit stick on the boat-side, that ye might\r\nhave time to play on the fiddle.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said the Udaller, \"make fast the sheets to the thwart? a most\r\nunseasonable practice, Claud Halcro.\"\r\n\r\n\"And sae came of it,\" replied the agriculturist; \"for the neist blast\r\n(and we are never lang without ane in these parts) whomled us as a\r\ngudewife would whomle a bowie, and ne'er a thing wad Maister Halcro save\r\nbut his fiddle. The puir bairn swam out like a water-spaniel, and I\r\nswattered hard for my life, wi' the help of ane of the oars; and here we\r\nare, comfortless creatures, that, till a good wind blew you here, had\r\nnaething to eat but a mouthful of Norway rusk, that has mair sawdust\r\nthan rye-meal in it, and tastes liker turpentine than any thing else.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought we heard you very merry,\" said Brenda, \"as we came along the\r\nbeach.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ye heard a fiddle, Mistress Brenda,\" said the Factor; \"and maybe ye may\r\nthink there can be nae dearth, miss, where that is skirling. But then\r\nit was Maister Claud Halcro's fiddle, whilk, I am apt to think, wad\r\nskirl at his father's deathbed, or at his ain, sae lang as his fingers\r\ncould pinch the thairm. And it was nae sma' aggravation to my misfortune\r\nto have him bumming a' sorts of springs,--Norse and Scots, Highland and\r\nLawland, English and Italian, in my lug, as if nothing had happened that\r\nwas amiss, and we all in such stress and perplexity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I told you sorrow would never right the boat, Factor,\" said the\r\nthoughtless minstrel, \"and I did my best to make you merry; if I failed,\r\nit was neither my fault nor my fiddle's. I have drawn the bow across it\r\nbefore glorious John Dryden himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will hear no stories about glorious John Dryden,\" answered the\r\nUdaller, who dreaded Halcro's narratives as much as Triptolemus did his\r\nmusic,--\"I will hear nought of him, but one story to every three bowls\r\nof punch,--it is our old paction, you know. But tell me, instead, what\r\nsaid Norna to you about your errand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, there was anither fine upshot,\" said Master Yellowley. \"She wadna\r\nlook at us, or listen to us; only she bothered our acquaintance, Master\r\nHalcro here, who thought he could have sae much to say wi' her, with\r\nabout a score of questions about your family and household estate,\r\nMaster Magnus Troil; and when she had gotten a' she wanted out of him, I\r\nthought she wad hae dung him ower the craig, like an empty peacod.\"\r\n\r\n\"And for yourself?\" said the Udaller.\r\n\r\n\"She wadna listen to my story, nor hear sae much as a word that I had to\r\nsay,\" answered Triptolemus; \"and sae much for them that seek to witches\r\nand familiar spirits!\"\r\n\r\n\"You needed not to have had recourse to Norna's wisdom, Master Factor,\"\r\nsaid Minna, not unwilling, perhaps, to stop his railing against the\r\nfriend who had so lately rendered her service; \"the youngest child in\r\nOrkney could have told you, that fairy treasures, if they are not wisely\r\nemployed for the good of others, as well as of those to whom they are\r\nimparted, do not dwell long with their possessors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your humble servant to command, Mistress Minnie,\" said Triptolemus; \"I\r\nthank ye for the hint,--and I am blithe that you have gotten your\r\nwits--I beg pardon, I meant your health--into the barn-yard again. For\r\nthe treasure, I neither used nor abused it,--they that live in the house\r\nwith my sister Baby wad find it hard to do either!--and as for speaking\r\nof it, whilk they say muckle offends them whom we in Scotland call Good\r\nNeighbours, and you call Drows, the face of the auld Norse kings on the\r\ncoins themselves, might have spoken as much about it as ever I did.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Factor,\" said Claud Halcro, not unwilling to seize the opportunity\r\nof revenging himself on Triptolemus, for disgracing his seamanship and\r\ndisparaging his music,--\"The Factor was so scrupulous, as to keep the\r\nthing quiet even from his master, the Lord Chamberlain; but, now that\r\nthe matter has ta'en wind, he is likely to have to account to his master\r\nfor that which is no longer in his possession; for the Lord Chamberlain\r\nwill be in no hurry, I think, to believe the story of the dwarf. Neither\r\ndo I think\" (winking to the Udaller) \"that Norna gave credit to a word\r\nof so odd a story; and I dare say that was the reason that she received\r\nus, I must needs say, in a very dry manner. I rather think she knew that\r\nTriptolemus, our friend here, had found some other hiding-hole for the\r\nmoney, and that the story of the goblin was all his own invention. For\r\nmy part, I will never believe there was such a dwarf to be seen as the\r\ncreature Master Yellowley describes, until I set my own eyes on him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you may do so at this moment,\" said the Factor; \"for, by ----,\"\r\n(he muttered a deep asseveration as he sprung on his feet in great\r\nhorror,) \"there the creature is!\"\r\n\r\nAll turned their eyes in the direction in which he pointed, and saw the\r\nhideous misshapen figure of Pacolet, with his eyes fixed and glaring at\r\nthem through the smoke. He had stolen upon their conversation\r\nunperceived, until the Factor's eye lighted upon him in the manner we\r\nhave described. There was something so ghastly in his sudden and\r\nunexpected appearance, that even the Udaller, to whom his form was\r\nfamiliar, could not help starting. Neither pleased with himself for\r\nhaving testified this degree of emotion, however slight, nor with the\r\ndwarf who had given cause to it, Magnus asked him sharply, what was his\r\nbusiness there? Pacolet replied by producing a letter, which he gave to\r\nthe Udaller, uttering a sound resembling the word _Shogh_.[28]\r\n\r\n\"That is the Highlandman's language,\" said the Udaller--\"didst thou\r\nlearn that, Nicholas, when you lost your own?\"\r\n\r\nPacolet nodded, and signed to him to read his letter.\r\n\r\n\"That is no such easy matter by fire-light, my good friend,\" replied the\r\nUdaller; \"but it may concern Minna, and we must try.\"\r\n\r\nBrenda offered her assistance, but the Udaller answered, \"No, no, my\r\ngirl,--Norna's letters must be read by those they are written to. Give\r\nthe knave, Strumpfer, a drop of brandy the while, though he little\r\ndeserves it at my hands, considering the grin with which he sent the\r\ngood Nantz down the crag this morning, as if it had been as much\r\nditch-water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Will you be this honest gentleman's cup-bearer--his Ganymede, friend\r\nYellowley, or shall I?\" said Claud Halcro aside to the Factor; while\r\nMagnus Troil, having carefully wiped his spectacles, which he produced\r\nfrom a large copper case, had disposed them on his nose, and was\r\nstudying the epistle of Norna.\r\n\r\n\"I would not touch him, or go near him, for all the Carse of Gowrie,\"\r\nsaid the Factor, whose fears were by no means entirely removed, though\r\nhe saw that the dwarf was received as a creature of flesh and blood by\r\nthe rest of the company; \"but I pray you to ask him what he has done\r\nwith my horn of coins?\"\r\n\r\nThe dwarf, who heard the question, threw back his head, and displayed\r\nhis enormous throat, pointing to it with his finger.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, if he has swallowed them, there is no more to be said,\" replied\r\nthe Factor; \"only I hope he will thrive on them as a cow on wet clover.\r\nHe is dame Norna's servant it's like,--such man, such mistress! But if\r\ntheft and witchcraft are to go unpunished in this land, my lord must\r\nfind another factor; for I have been used to live in a country where\r\nmen's worldly gear was keepit from infang and outfang thief, as well as\r\ntheir immortal souls from the claws of the deil and his cummers,--sain\r\nand save us!\"\r\n\r\nThe agriculturist was perhaps the less reserved in expressing his\r\ncomplaints, that the Udaller was for the present out of hearing, having\r\ndrawn Claud Halcro apart into another corner of the hut.\r\n\r\n\"And tell me,\" said he, \"friend Halcro, what errand took thee to\r\nSumburgh, since I reckon it was scarce the mere pleasure of sailing in\r\npartnership with yonder barnacle?\"\r\n\r\n\"In faith, Fowd,\" said the bard, \"and if you will have the truth, I went\r\nto speak to Norna on your affairs.\"\r\n\r\n\"On my affairs?\" replied the Udaller; \"on what affairs of mine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just touching your daughter's health. I heard that Norna refused your\r\nmessage, and would not see Eric Scambester. Now, said I to myself, I\r\nhave scarce joyed in meat, or drink, or music, or aught else, since\r\nJarto Minna has been so ill; and I may say, literally as well as\r\nfiguratively, that my day and night have been made sorrowful to me. In\r\nshort, I thought I might have some more interest with old Norna than\r\nanother, as scalds and wise women were always accounted something akin;\r\nand I undertook the journey with the hope to be of some use to my old\r\nfriend and his lovely daughter.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it was most kindly done of you, good warm-hearted Claud,\" said the\r\nUdaller, shaking him warmly by the hand,--\"I ever said you showed the\r\ngood old Norse heart amongst all thy fiddling and thy folly.--Tut, man,\r\nnever wince for the matter, but be blithe that thy heart is better than\r\nthy head. Well,--and I warrant you got no answer from Norna?\"\r\n\r\n\"None to purpose,\" replied Claud Halcro; \"but she held me close to\r\nquestion about Minna's illness, too,--and I told her how I had met her\r\nabroad the other morning in no very good weather, and how her sister\r\nBrenda said she had hurt her foot;--in short, I told her all and every\r\nthing I knew.\"\r\n\r\n\"And something more besides, it would seem,\" said the Udaller; \"for I,\r\nat least, never heard before that Minna had hurt herself.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, a scratch! a mere scratch!\" said the old man; \"but I was startled\r\nabout it--terrified lest it had been the bite of a dog, or some hurt\r\nfrom a venomous thing. I told all to Norna, however.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what,\" answered the Udaller, \"did she say, in the way of reply?\"\r\n\r\n\"She bade me begone about my business, and told me that the issue would\r\nbe known at the Kirkwall Fair; and said just the like to this noodle of\r\na Factor--it was all that either of us got for our labour,\" said Halcro.\r\n\r\n\"That is strange,\" said Magnus. \"My kinswoman writes me in this letter\r\nnot to fail going thither with my daughters. This Fair runs strongly in\r\nher head;--one would think she intended to lead the market, and yet she\r\nhas nothing to buy or to sell there that I know of. And so you came away\r\nas wise as you went, and swamped your boat at the mouth of the voe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, how could I help it?\" said the poet. \"I had set the boy to steer,\r\nand as the flaw came suddenly off shore, I could not let go the\r\ntack and play on the fiddle at the same time. But it is all well\r\nenough,--salt-water never harmed Zetlander, so as he could get out of\r\nit; and, as Heaven would have it, we were within man's depth of the\r\nshore, and chancing to find this skio, we should have done well enough,\r\nwith shelter and fire, and are much better than well with your good\r\ncheer and good company. But it wears late, and Night and Day must be\r\nboth as sleepy as old Midnight can make them. There is an inner crib\r\nhere, where the fishers slept,--somewhat fragrant with the smell of\r\ntheir fish, but that is wholesome. They shall bestow themselves there,\r\nwith the help of what cloaks you have, and then we will have one cup of\r\nbrandy, and one stave of glorious John, or some little trifle of my own,\r\nand so sleep as sound as cobblers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Two glasses of brandy, if you please,\" said the Udaller, \"if our stores\r\ndo not run dry; but not a single stave of glorious John, or of any one\r\nelse to-night.\"\r\n\r\nAnd this being arranged and executed agreeably to the peremptory\r\npleasure of the Udaller, the whole party consigned themselves to slumber\r\nfor the night, and on the next day departed for their several\r\nhabitations, Claud Halcro having previously arranged with the Udaller\r\nthat he would accompany him and his daughters on their proposed visit to\r\nKirkwall.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[23] _Jokul_, yes, sir; a Norse expression, still in common use.\r\n\r\n[24] The Bicker of Saint Magnus, a vessel of enormous dimensions, was\r\npreserved at Kirkwall, and presented to each bishop of the Orkneys.

These remains, though much\r\ndilapidated, still exist in the neighbourhood of the massive and\r\nvenerable pile, which Norwegian devotion dedicated to Saint Magnus the\r\nMartyr, and, being contiguous to the Bishop's Palace, which is also\r\nruinous, the place is impressive, as exhibiting vestiges of the\r\nmutations both in Church and State which have affected Orkney, as well\r\nas countries more exposed to such convulsions. Several parts of these\r\nruinous buildings might be selected (under suitable modifications) as\r\nthe model of a Gothic mansion, provided architects would be contented\r\nrather to imitate what is really beautiful in that species of building,\r\nthan to make a medley of the caprices of the order, confounding the\r\nmilitary, ecclesiastical, and domestic styles of all ages at random,\r\nwith additional fantasies and combinations of their own device, \"all\r\nformed out of the builder's brain.\"\r\n\r\nThe Earl's Palace forms three sides of an oblong square, and has, even\r\nin its ruins, the air of an elegant yet massive structure, uniting, as\r\nwas usual in the residence of feudal princes, the character of a palace\r\nand of a castle. A great banqueting-hall, communicating with several\r\nlarge rounds, or projecting turret-rooms, and having at either end an\r\nimmense chimney, testifies the ancient Northern hospitality of the Earls\r\nof Orkney, and communicates, almost in the modern fashion, with a\r\ngallery, or withdrawing-room, of corresponding dimensions, and having,\r\nlike the hall, its projecting turrets. The lordly hall itself is lighted\r\nby a fine Gothic window of shafted stone at one end, and is entered by a\r\nspacious and elegant staircase, consisting of three flights of stone\r\nsteps. The exterior ornaments and proportions of the ancient building\r\nare also very handsome; but, being totally unprotected, this remnant of\r\nthe pomp and grandeur of Earls, who assumed the license as well as the\r\ndignity of petty sovereigns, is now fast crumbling to decay, and has\r\nsuffered considerably since the date of our story.\r\n\r\nWith folded arms and downcast looks the pirate Cleveland was pacing\r\nslowly the ruined hall which we have just described; a place of\r\nretirement which he had probably chosen because it was distant from\r\npublic resort. His dress was considerably altered from that which he\r\nusually wore in Zetland, and seemed a sort of uniform, richly laced, and\r\nexhibiting no small quantity of embroidery: a hat with a plume, and a\r\nsmall sword very handsomely mounted, then the constant companion of\r\nevery one who assumed the rank of a gentleman, showed his pretensions to\r\nthat character. But if his exterior was so far improved, it seemed to be\r\notherwise with his health and spirits. He was pale, and had lost both\r\nthe fire of his eye and the vivacity of his step, and his whole\r\nappearance indicated melancholy of mind, or suffering of body, or a\r\ncombination of both evils.\r\n\r\nAs Cleveland thus paced these ancient ruins, a young man, of a light and\r\nslender form, whose showy dress seemed to have been studied with care,\r\nyet exhibited more extravagance than judgment or taste, whose manner was\r\na janty affectation of the free and easy rake of the period, and the\r\nexpression of whose countenance was lively, with a cast of effrontery,\r\ntripped up the staircase, entered the hall, and presented himself to\r\nCleveland, who merely nodded to him, and pulling his hat deeper over his\r\nbrows, resumed his solitary and discontented promenade.\r\n\r\nThe stranger adjusted his own hat, nodded in return, took snuff, with\r\nthe air of a _petit maitre_, from a richly chased gold box, offered it\r\nto Cleveland as he passed, and being repulsed rather coldly, replaced\r\nthe box in his pocket, folded his arms in his turn, and stood looking\r\nwith fixed attention on his motions whose solitude he had interrupted.\r\nAt length Cleveland stopped short, as if impatient of being longer the\r\nsubject of his observation, and said abruptly, \"Why can I not be left\r\nalone for half an hour, and what the devil is it that you want?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you spoke first,\" answered the stranger, carelessly; \"I was\r\ndetermined to know whether you were Clement Cleveland, or Cleveland's\r\nghost, and they say ghosts never take the first word, so I now set it\r\ndown for yourself in life and limb; and here is a fine old hurly-house\r\nyou have found out for an owl to hide himself in at mid-day, or a ghost\r\nto revisit the pale glimpses of the moon, as the divine Shakspeare\r\nsays.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" answered Cleveland, abruptly, \"your jest is made, and now\r\nlet us have your earnest.\"\r\n\r\n\"In earnest, then, Captain Cleveland,\" replied his companion, \"I think\r\nyou know me for your friend.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am content to suppose so,\" said Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\"It is more than supposition,\" replied the young man; \"I have proved\r\nit--proved it both here and elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" answered Cleveland, \"I admit you have been always a\r\nfriendly fellow--and what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well--and what then?\" replied the other; \"this is but a brief way\r\nof thanking folk. Look you, Captain, here is Benson, Barlowe, Dick\r\nFletcher, and a few others of us who wished you well, have kept your old\r\ncomrade Captain Goffe in these seas upon the look-out for you, when he\r\nand Hawkins, and the greater part of the ship's company, would fain have\r\nbeen down on the Spanish Main, and at the old trade.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I wish to God that you had all gone about your business,\" said\r\nCleveland, \"and left me to my fate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Which would have been to be informed against and hanged, Captain, the\r\nfirst time that any of these Dutch or English rascals, whom you have\r\nlightened of their cargoes, came to set their eyes upon you; and no\r\nplace more likely to meet with seafaring men, than in these Islands. And\r\nhere, to screen you from such a risk, we have been wasting our precious\r\ntime, till folk are grown very peery; and when we have no more goods or\r\nmoney to spend amongst them, the fellows will be for grabbing the ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, why do you not sail off without me?\" said Cleveland--\"there\r\nhas been fair partition, and all have had their share--let all do as\r\nthey like. I have lost my ship, and having been once a Captain, I will\r\nnot go to sea under command of Goffe or any other man. Besides, you know\r\nwell enough that both Hawkins and he bear me ill-will for keeping them\r\nfrom sinking the Spanish brig, with the poor devils of negroes on\r\nboard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, what the foul fiend is the matter with thee?\" said his companion;\r\n\"are you Clement Cleveland, our own old true-hearted Clem of the Cleugh,\r\nand do you talk of being afraid of Hawkins and Goffe, and a score of\r\nsuch fellows, when you have myself, and Barlowe, and Dick Fletcher at\r\nyour back? When was it we deserted you, either in council or in fight,\r\nthat you should be afraid of our flinching now? And as for serving under\r\nGoffe, I hope it is no new thing for gentlemen of fortune who are going\r\non the account, to change a Captain now and then? Let us alone for\r\nthat,--Captain you shall be; for death rock me asleep if I serve under\r\nthat fellow Goffe, who is as very a bloodhound as ever sucked\r\nbitch!--No, no, I thank you--my Captain must have a little of the\r\ngentleman about him, howsoever. Besides, you know, it was you who first\r\ndipped my hands in the dirty water, and turned me from a stroller by\r\nland, to a rover by sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas, poor Bunce!\" said Cleveland, \"you owe me little thanks for that\r\nservice.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is as you take it,\" replied Bunce; \"for my part, I see no harm in\r\nlevying contributions on the public either one way or t'other. But I\r\nwish you would forget that name of Bunce, and call me Altamont, as I\r\nhave often desired you to do. I hope a gentleman of the roving trade has\r\nas good a right to have an alias as a stroller, and I never stepped on\r\nthe boards but what I was Altamont at the least.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, Jack Altamont,\" replied Cleveland, \"since Altamont is the\r\nword\"----\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but, Captain, _Jack_ is not the word, though Altamont be so. Jack\r\nAltamont?--why, 'tis a velvet coat with paper lace--Let it be Frederick,\r\nCaptain; Frederick Altamont is all of a piece.\"\r\n\r\n\"Frederick be it, then, with all my heart,\" said Cleveland; \"and pray\r\ntell me, which of your names will sound best at the head of the Last\r\nSpeech, Confession, and Dying Words of John Bunce, _alias_ Frederick\r\nAltamont, who was this morning hanged at Execution-dock, for the crime\r\nof Piracy upon the High Seas?\"\r\n\r\n\"Faith, I cannot answer that question, without another can of grog,\r\nCaptain; so if you will go down with me to Bet Haldane's on the quay, I\r\nwill bestow some thought on the matter, with the help of a right pipe of\r\nTrinidado. We will have the gallon bowl filled with the best stuff you\r\never tasted, and I know some smart wenches who will help us to drain it.\r\nBut you shake your head--you're not i' the vein?--Well, then, I will\r\nstay with you; for by this hand, Clem, you shift me not off. Only I will\r\nferret you out of this burrow of old stones, and carry you into sunshine\r\nand fair air.--Where shall we go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where you will,\" said Cleveland, \"so that you keep out of the way of\r\nour own rascals, and all others.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then,\" replied Bunce, \"you and I will go up to the Hill of\r\nWhitford, which overlooks the town, and walk together as gravely and\r\nhonestly as a pair of well-employed attorneys.\"\r\n\r\nAs they proceeded to leave the ruinous castle, Bunce, turning back to\r\nlook at it, thus addressed his companion:\r\n\r\n\"Hark ye, Captain, dost thou know who last inhabited this old cockloft?\"\r\n\r\n\"An Earl of the Orkneys, they say,\" replied Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\"And are you avised what death he died of?\" said Bunce; \"for I have\r\nheard that it was of a tight neck-collar--a hempen fever, or the like.\"\r\n\r\n\"The people here do say,\" replied Cleveland, \"that his Lordship, some\r\nhundred years ago, had the mishap to become acquainted with the nature\r\nof a loop and a leap in the air.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, la ye there now!\" said Bunce; \"there was some credit in being\r\nhanged in those days, and in such worshipful company. And what might his\r\nlordship have done to deserve such promotion?\"\r\n\r\n\"Plundered the liege subjects, they say,\" replied Cleveland; \"slain and\r\nwounded them, fired upon his Majesty's flag, and so forth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Near akin to a gentleman rover, then,\" said Bunce, making a theatrical\r\nbow towards the old building; \"and, therefore, my most potent, grave,\r\nand reverend Signior Earl, I crave leave to call you my loving cousin,\r\nand bid you most heartily adieu. I leave you in the good company of rats\r\nand mice, and so forth, and I carry with me an honest gentleman, who,\r\nhaving of late had no more heart than a mouse, is now desirous to run\r\naway from his profession and friends like a rat, and would therefore be\r\na most fitting denizen of your Earlship's palace.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would advise you not to speak so loud, my good friend Frederick\r\nAltamont, or John Bunce,\" said Cleveland; \"when you were on the stage,\r\nyou might safely rant as loud as you listed; but, in your present\r\nprofession, of which you are so fond, every man speaks under correction\r\nof the yard-arm, and a running noose.\"\r\n\r\nThe comrades left the little town of Kirkwall in silence, and ascended\r\nthe Hill of Whitford, which raises its brow of dark heath, uninterrupted\r\nby enclosures or cultivation of any kind, to the northward of the\r\nancient Burgh of Saint Magnus. The plain at the foot of the hill was\r\nalready occupied by numbers of persons who were engaged in making\r\npreparations for the Fair of Saint Olla, to be held upon the ensuing\r\nday, and which forms a general rendezvous to all the neighbouring\r\nislands of Orkney, and is even frequented by many persons from the more\r\ndistant archipelago of Zetland. It is, in the words of the Proclamation,\r\n\"a free Mercat and Fair, holden at the good Burgh of Kirkwall on the\r\nthird of August, being Saint Olla's day,\" and continuing for an\r\nindefinite space thereafter, extending from three days to a week, and\r\nupwards. The fair is of great antiquity, and derives its name from\r\nOlaus, Olave, Ollaw, the celebrated Monarch of Norway, who, rather by\r\nthe edge of his sword than any milder argument, introduced Christianity\r\ninto those isles, and was respected as the patron of Kirkwall some time\r\nbefore he shared that honour with Saint Magnus the Martyr.\r\n\r\nIt was no part of Cleveland's purpose to mingle in the busy scene which\r\nwas here going on; and, turning their route to the left, they soon\r\nascended into undisturbed solitude, save where the grouse, more\r\nplentiful in Orkney, perhaps, than in any other part of the British\r\ndominions, rose in covey, and went off before them.[29] Having continued\r\nto ascend till they had wellnigh reached the summit of the conical\r\nhill, both turned round, as with one consent, to look at and admire the\r\nprospect beneath.\r\n\r\nThe lively bustle which extended between the foot of the hill and the\r\ntown, gave life and variety to that part of the scene; then was seen the\r\ntown itself, out of which arose, like a great mass, superior in\r\nproportion as it seemed to the whole burgh, the ancient Cathedral of\r\nSaint Magnus, of the heaviest order of Gothic architecture, but grand,\r\nsolemn, and stately, the work of a distant age, and of a powerful hand.\r\nThe quay, with the shipping, lent additional vivacity to the scene; and\r\nnot only the whole beautiful bay, which lies betwixt the promontories of\r\nInganess and Quanterness, at the bottom of which Kirkwall is situated,\r\nbut all the sea, so far as visible, and in particular the whole strait\r\nbetwixt the island of Shapinsha and that called Pomona, or the Mainland,\r\nwas covered and enlivened by a variety of boats and small vessels,\r\nfreighted from distant islands to convey passengers or merchandise to\r\nthe Fair of Saint Olla.\r\n\r\nHaving attained the point by which this fair and busy prospect was most\r\ncompletely commanded, each of the strangers, in seaman fashion, had\r\nrecourse to his spy-glass, to assist the naked eye in considering the\r\nbay of Kirkwall, and the numerous vessels by which it was traversed. But\r\nthe attention of the two companions seemed to be arrested by different\r\nobjects. That of Bunce, or Altamont, as he chose to call himself, was\r\nriveted to the armed sloop, where, conspicuous by her square rigging and\r\nlength of beam, with the English jack and pennon, which they had the\r\nprecaution to keep flying, she lay among the merchant vessels, as\r\ndistinguished from them by the trim neatness of her appearance, as a\r\ntrained soldier amongst a crowd of clowns.\r\n\r\n\"Yonder she lies,\" said Bunce; \"I wish to God she was in the bay of\r\nHonduras--you Captain, on the quarter-deck, I your lieutenant, and\r\nFletcher quarter-master, and fifty stout fellows under us--I should not\r\nwish to see these blasted heaths and rocks again for a while!--And\r\nCaptain you shall soon be. The old brute Goffe gets drunk as a lord\r\nevery day, swaggers, and shoots, and cuts, among the crew; and, besides,\r\nhe has quarrelled with the people here so damnably, that they will\r\nscarce let water or provisions go on board of us, and we expect an open\r\nbreach every day.\"\r\n\r\nAs Bunce received no answer, he turned short round on his companion,\r\nand, perceiving his attention otherwise engaged, exclaimed,--\"What the\r\ndevil is the matter with you? or what can you see in all that trumpery\r\nsmall-craft, which is only loaded with stock-fish, and ling, and smoked\r\ngeese, and tubs of butter that is worse than tallow?--the cargoes of the\r\nwhole lumped together would not be worth the flash of a pistol.--No, no,\r\ngive me such a chase as we might see from the mast-head off the island\r\nof Trinidado. Your Don, rolling as deep in the water as a grampus,\r\ndeep-loaden with rum, sugar, and bales of tobacco, and all the rest\r\ningots, moidores, and gold dust; then set all sail, clear the deck,\r\nstand to quarters, up with the Jolly Roger[30]--we near her--we make\r\nher out to be well manned and armed\"----\r\n\r\n\"Twenty guns on her lower deck,\" said Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\"Forty, if you will,\" retorted Bunce, \"and we have but ten\r\nmounted--never mind. The Don blazes away--never mind yet, my brave\r\nlads--run her alongside, and on board with you--to work, with your\r\ngrenadoes, your cutlasses, pole-axes, and pistols--The Don cries\r\nMisericordia, and we share the cargo without _co licencio, Seignior_!\"\r\n\r\n\"By my faith,\" said Cleveland, \"thou takest so kindly to the trade, that\r\nall the world may see that no honest man was spoiled when you were made\r\na pirate. But you shall not prevail on me to go farther in the devil's\r\nroad with you; for you know yourself that what is got over his back is\r\nspent--you wot how. In a week, or a month at most, the rum and the sugar\r\nare out, the bales of tobacco have become smoke, the moidores, ingots,\r\nand gold dust, have got out of our hands, into those of the quiet,\r\nhonest, conscientious folks, who dwell at Port Royal and elsewhere--wink\r\nhard on our trade as long as we have money, but not a jot beyond. Then\r\nwe have cold looks, and it may be a hint is given to the Judge Marshal;\r\nfor, when our pockets are worth nothing, our honest friends, rather than\r\nwant, will make money upon our heads. Then comes a high gallows and a\r\nshort halter, and so dies the Gentleman Rover. I tell thee, I will leave\r\nthis trade; and, when I turn my glass from one of these barks and boats\r\nto another, there is not the worst of them which I would not row for\r\nlife, rather than continue to be what I have been. These poor men make\r\nthe sea a means of honest livelihood and friendly communication between\r\nshore and shore, for the mutual benefit of the inhabitants; but we have\r\nmade it a road to the ruin of others, and to our own destruction here\r\nand in eternity.--I am determined to turn honest man, and use this life\r\nno longer!\"\r\n\r\n\"And where will your honesty take up its abode, if it please you?\" said\r\nBunce.--\"You have broken the laws of every nation, and the hand of the\r\nlaw will detect and crush you wherever you may take refuge.--Cleveland,\r\nI speak to you more seriously than I am wont to do. I have had my\r\nreflections, too; and they have been bad enough, though they lasted but\r\na few minutes, to spoil me weeks of joviality. But here is the\r\nmatter,--what can we do but go on as we have done, unless we have a\r\ndirect purpose of adorning the yard-arm?\"\r\n\r\n\"We may claim the benefit of the proclamation to those of our sort who\r\ncome in and surrender,\" said Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\"Umph!\" answered his companion, dryly; \"the date of that day of grace\r\nhas been for some time over, and they may take the penalty or grant the\r\npardon at their pleasure. Were I you, I would not put my neck in such a\r\nventure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, others have been admitted but lately to favour, and why should not\r\nI?\" said Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" replied his associate, \"Harry Glasby and some others have been\r\nspared; but Glasby did what was called good service, in betraying his\r\ncomrades, and retaking the Jolly Fortune; and that I think you would\r\nscorn, even to be revenged of the brute Goffe yonder.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would die a thousand times sooner,\" said Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\"I will be sworn for it,\" said Bunce; \"and the others were forecastle\r\nfellows--petty larceny rogues, scarce worth the hemp it would have cost\r\nto hang them. But your name has stood too high amongst the gentlemen of\r\nfortune for you to get off so easily. You are the prime buck of the\r\nherd, and will be marked accordingly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why so, I pray you?\" said Cleveland; \"you know well enough my aim,\r\nJack.\"\r\n\r\n\"Frederick, if you please,\" said Bunce.\r\n\r\n\"The devil take your folly!--Prithee keep thy wit, and let us be grave\r\nfor a moment.\"\r\n\r\n\"For a moment--be it so,\" said Bunce; \"but I feel the spirit of Altamont\r\ncoming fast upon me,--I have been a grave man for ten minutes already.\"\r\n\r\n\"Be so then for a little longer,\" said Cleveland; \"I know, Jack, that\r\nyou really love me; and, since we have come thus far in this talk, I\r\nwill trust you entirely. Now tell me, why should I be refused the\r\nbenefit of this gracious proclamation? I have borne a rough outside, as\r\nthou knowest; but, in time of need, I can show the numbers of lives\r\nwhich I have been the means of saving, the property which I have\r\nrestored to those who owned it, when, without my intercession, it would\r\nhave been wantonly destroyed. In short, Bunce, I can show\"----\r\n\r\n\"That you were as gentle a thief as Robin Hood himself,\" said Bunce;\r\n\"and, for that reason, I, Fletcher, and the better sort among us, love\r\nyou, as one who saves the character of us Gentlemen Rovers from utter\r\nreprobation.--Well, suppose your pardon made out, what are you to do\r\nnext?--what class in society will receive you?--with whom will you\r\nassociate? Old Drake, in Queen Bess's time, could plunder Peru and\r\nMexico without a line of commission to show for it, and, blessed be her\r\nmemory! he was knighted for it on his return. And there was Hal Morgan,\r\nthe Welshman, nearer our time, in the days of merry King Charles,\r\nbrought all his gettings home, had his estate and his country-house, and\r\nwho but he? But that is all ended now--once a pirate, and an outcast for\r\never. The poor devil may go and live, shunned and despised by every one,\r\nin some obscure seaport, with such part of his guilty earnings as\r\ncourtiers and clerks leave him--for pardons do not pass the seals for\r\nnothing;--and, when he takes his walk along the pier, if a stranger\r\nasks, who is the down-looking, swarthy, melancholy man, for whom all\r\nmake way, as if he brought the plague in his person, the answer shall\r\nbe, that is such a one, the pardoned pirate!--No honest man will speak\r\nto him, no woman of repute will give him her hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your picture is too highly coloured, Jack,\" said Cleveland, suddenly\r\ninterrupting his friend; \"there are women--there is one at least, that\r\nwould be true to her lover, even if he were what you have described.\"\r\n\r\nBunce was silent for a space, and looked fixedly at his friend. \"By my\r\nsoul!\" he said, at length, \"I begin to think myself a conjurer. Unlikely\r\nas it all was, I could not help suspecting from the beginning that there\r\nwas a girl in the case. Why, this is worse than Prince Volscius in love,\r\nha! ha! ha!\"\r\n\r\n\"Laugh as you will,\" said Cleveland, \"it is true;--there is a maiden who\r\nis contented to love me, pirate as I am; and I will fairly own to you,\r\nJack, that, though I have often at times detested our roving life, and\r\nmyself for following it, yet I doubt if I could have found resolution to\r\nmake the break which I have now resolved on, but for her sake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then, God-a-mercy!\" replied Bunce, \"there is no speaking sense to\r\na madman; and love in one of our trade, Captain, is little better than\r\nlunacy. The girl must be a rare creature, for a wise man to risk hanging\r\nfor her. But, harkye, may she not be a little touched, as well as\r\nyourself?--and is it not sympathy that has done it? She cannot be one of\r\nour ordinary cockatrices, but a girl of conduct and character.\"\r\n\r\n\"Both are as undoubted as that she is the most beautiful and bewitching\r\ncreature whom the eye ever opened upon,\" answered Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\"And she loves thee, knowing thee, most noble Captain, to be a commander\r\namong those gentlemen of fortune, whom the vulgar call pirates?\"\r\n\r\n\"Even so--I am assured of it,\" said Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\"Why, then,\" answered Bunce, \"she is either mad in good earnest, as I\r\nsaid before, or she does not know what a pirate is.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right in the last point,\" replied Cleveland. \"She has been bred\r\nin such remote simplicity, and utter ignorance of what is evil, that she\r\ncompares our occupation with that of the old Norsemen, who swept sea and\r\nhaven with their victorious galleys, established colonies, conquered\r\ncountries, and took the name of Sea-Kings.\"\r\n\r\n\"And a better one it is than that of pirate, and comes much to the same\r\npurpose, I dare say,\" said Bunce. \"But this must be a mettled\r\nwench!--why did you not bring her aboard? methinks it was pity to baulk\r\nher fancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you think,\" said Cleveland, \"that I could so utterly play the\r\npart of a fallen spirit as to avail myself of her enthusiastic error,\r\nand bring an angel of beauty and innocence acquainted with such a hell\r\nas exists on board of yonder infernal ship of ours?--I tell you, my\r\nfriend, that, were all my former sins doubled in weight and in dye, such\r\na villainy would have outglared and outweighed them all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then, Captain Cleveland,\" said his confident, \"methinks it was but\r\na fool's part to come hither at all. The news must one day have gone\r\nabroad, that the celebrated pirate Captain Cleveland, with his good\r\nsloop the Revenge, had been lost on the Mainland of Zetland, and all\r\nhands perished; so you would have remained hid both from friend and\r\nenemy, and might have married your pretty Zetlander, and converted your\r\nsash and scarf into fishing-nets, and your cutlass into a harpoon, and\r\nswept the seas for fish instead of florins.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so I had determined,\" said the Captain; \"but a Jagger, as they call\r\nthem here, like a meddling, peddling thief as he is, brought down\r\nintelligence to Zetland of your lying here, and I was fain to set off,\r\nto see if you were the consort of whom I had told them, long before I\r\nthought of leaving the roving trade.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" said Bunce, \"and so far you judged well. For, as you had heard of\r\nour being at Kirkwall, so we should have soon learned that you were at\r\nZetland; and some of us for friendship, some for hatred, and some for\r\nfear of your playing Harry Glasby upon us, would have come down for the\r\npurpose of getting you into our company again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suspected as much,\" said the Captain, \"and therefore was fain to\r\ndecline the courteous offer of a friend, who proposed to bring me here\r\nabout this time. Besides, Jack, I recollected, that, as you say, my\r\npardon will not pass the seals without money, my own was waxing low--no\r\nwonder, thou knowest I was never a churl of it--And so\"----\r\n\r\n\"And so you came for your share of the cobs?\" replied his friend--\"It\r\nwas wisely done; and we shared honourably--so far Goffe has acted up to\r\narticles, it must be allowed. But keep your purpose of leaving him close\r\nin your breast, for I dread his playing you some dog's trick or other;\r\nfor he certainly thought himself sure of your share, and will hardly\r\nforgive your coming alive to disappoint him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I fear him not,\" said Cleveland, \"and he knows that well. I would I\r\nwere as well clear of the consequences of having been his comrade, as I\r\nhold myself to be of all those which may attend his ill-will. Another\r\nunhappy job I may be troubled with--I hurt a young fellow, who has been\r\nmy plague for some time, in an unhappy brawl that chanced the morning I\r\nleft Zetland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is he dead?\" asked Bunce: \"It is a more serious question here, than it\r\nwould be on the Grand Caimains or the Bahama Isles, where a brace or two\r\nof fellows may be shot in a morning, and no more heard of, or asked\r\nabout them, than if they were so many wood-pigeons. But here it may be\r\notherwise; so I hope you have not made your friend immortal.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope not,\" said the Captain, \"though my anger has been fatal to those\r\nwho have given me less provocation. To say the truth, I was sorry for\r\nthe lad notwithstanding, and especially as I was forced to leave him in\r\nmad keeping.\"\r\n\r\n\"In mad keeping?\" said Bunce; \"why, what means that?\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall hear,\" replied his friend. \"In the first place, you are to\r\nknow, this young man came suddenly on me while I was trying to gain\r\nMinna's ear for a private interview before I set sail, that I might\r\nexplain my purpose to her. Now, to be broken in on by the accursed\r\nrudeness of this young fellow at such a moment\"----\r\n\r\n\"The interruption deserved death,\" said Bunce, \"by all the laws of love\r\nand honour!\"\r\n\r\n\"A truce with your ends of plays, Jack, and listen one moment.--The\r\nbrisk youth thought proper to retort, when I commanded him to be gone. I\r\nam not, thou knowest, very patient, and enforced my commands with a\r\nblow, which he returned as roundly. We struggled, till I became desirous\r\nthat we should part at any rate, which I could only effect by a stroke\r\nof my poniard, which, according to old use, I have, thou knowest, always\r\nabout me. I had scarce done this when I repented; but there was no time\r\nto think of any thing save escape and concealment, for, if the house\r\nrose on me, I was lost; as the fiery old man, who is head of the family,\r\nwould have done justice on me had I been his brother. I took the body\r\nhastily on my shoulders to carry it down to the sea-shore, with the\r\npurpose of throwing it into a _riva_, as they call them, or chasm of\r\ngreat depth, where it would have been long enough in being discovered.\r\nThis done, I intended to jump into the boat which I had lying ready, and\r\nset sail for Kirkwall. But, as I was walking hastily towards the beach\r\nwith my burden, the poor young fellow groaned, and so apprized me that\r\nthe wound had not been instantly fatal. I was by this time well\r\nconcealed amongst the rocks, and, far from desiring to complete my\r\ncrime, I laid the young man on the ground, and was doing what I could to\r\nstanch the blood, when suddenly an old woman stood before me. She was a\r\nperson whom I had frequently seen while in Zetland, and to whom they\r\nascribe the character of a sorceress, or, as the negroes say, an Obi\r\nwoman. She demanded the wounded man of me, and I was too much pressed\r\nfor time to hesitate in complying with her request. More she was about\r\nto say to me, when we heard the voice of a silly old man, belonging to\r\nthe family, singing at some distance. She then pressed her finger on her\r\nlip as a sign of secrecy, whistled very low, and a shapeless, deformed\r\nbrute of a dwarf coming to her assistance, they carried the wounded man\r\ninto one of the caverns with which the place abounds, and I got to my\r\nboat and to sea with all expedition. If that old hag be, as they say,\r\nconnected with the King of the Air, she favoured me that morning with a\r\nturn of her calling; for not even the West Indian tornadoes, which we\r\nhave weathered together, made a wilder racket than the squall that drove\r\nme so far out of our course, that, without a pocket-compass, which I\r\nchanced to have about me, I should never have recovered the Fair Isle,\r\nfor which we run, and where I found a brig which brought me to this\r\nplace. But, whether the old woman meant me weal or woe, here we came at\r\nlength in safety from the sea, and here I remain in doubts and\r\ndifficulties of more kinds than one.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, the devil take the Sumburgh-head,\" said Bunce, \"or whatever they\r\ncall the rock that you knocked our clever little Revenge against!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do not say _I_ knocked her on the rock,\" said Cleveland; \"have I not\r\ntold you fifty times, if the cowards had not taken to their boat, though\r\nI showed them the danger, and told them they would all be swamped, which\r\nhappened the instant they cast off the painter, she would have been\r\nafloat at this moment? Had they stood by me and the ship, their lives\r\nwould have been saved; had I gone with them, mine would have been lost;\r\nwho can say which is for the best?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied his friend, \"I know your case now, and can the better\r\nhelp and advise. I will be true to you, Clement, as the blade to the\r\nhilt; but I cannot think that you should leave us. As the old Scottish\r\nsong says, 'Wae's my heart that we should sunder!'--But come, you will\r\naboard with us to-day, at any rate?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no other place of refuge,\" said Cleveland, with a sigh.\r\n\r\nHe then once more ran his eyes over the bay, directing his spy-glass\r\nupon several of the vessels which traversed its surface, in hopes,\r\ndoubtless, of discerning the vessel of Magnus Troil, and then followed\r\nhis companion down the hill in silence.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[29] It is very curious that the grouse, plenty in Orkney as the text\r\ndeclares, should be totally unknown in the neighbouring archipelago of\r\nZetland, which is only about sixty miles distance, with the Fair Isle as\r\na step between.\r\n\r\n[30] The pirates gave this name to the black flag, which, with many\r\nhorrible devices to enhance its terrors, was their favourite ensign.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n  I strive like to the vessel in the tide-way,\r\n  Which, lacking favouring breeze, hath not the power\r\n  To stem the powerful current.--Even so,\r\n  Resolving daily to forsake my vices,\r\n  Habits, strong circumstance, renew'd temptation,\r\n  Sweep me to sea again.--O heavenly breath,\r\n  Fill thou my sails, and aid the feeble vessel,\r\n  Which ne'er can reach the blessed port without thee!\r\n\r\n                                _'Tis Odds when Evens meet._\r\n\r\n\r\nCleveland, with his friend Bunce, descended the hill for a time in\r\nsilence, until at length the latter renewed their conversation.\r\n\r\n\"You have taken this fellow's wound more on your conscience than you\r\nneed, Captain--I have known you do more, and think less on't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not on such slight provocation, Jack,\" replied Cleveland. \"Besides, the\r\nlad saved my life; and, say that I requited him the favour, still we\r\nshould not have met on such evil terms; but I trust that he may receive\r\naid from that woman, who has certainly strange skill in simples.\"\r\n\r\n\"And over simpletons, Captain,\" said his friend, \"in which class I must\r\ne'en put you down, if you think more on this subject. That you should be\r\nmade a fool of by a young woman, why it is many an honest man's\r\ncase;--but to puzzle your pate about the mummeries of an old one, is far\r\ntoo great a folly to indulge a friend in. Talk to me of your Minna,\r\nsince you so call her, as much as you will; but you have no title to\r\ntrouble your faithful squire-errant with your old mumping magician. And\r\nnow here we are once more amongst the booths and tents, which these good\r\nfolk are pitching--let us look, and see whether we may not find some fun\r\nand frolic amongst them. In merry England, now, you would have seen, on\r\nsuch an occasion, two or three bands of strollers, as many fire-eaters\r\nand conjurers, as many shows of wild beasts; but, amongst these grave\r\nfolk, there is nothing but what savours of business and of\r\ncommodity--no, not so much as a single squall from my merry gossip Punch\r\nand his rib Joan.\"\r\n\r\nAs Bunce thus spoke, Cleveland cast his eyes on some very gay clothes,\r\nwhich, with other articles, hung out upon one of the booths, that had a\r\ngood deal more of ornament and exterior decoration than the rest. There\r\nwas in front a small sign of canvass painted, announcing the variety of\r\ngoods which the owner of the booth, Bryce Snailsfoot, had on sale, and\r\nthe reasonable prices at which he proposed to offer them to the public.\r\nFor the further gratification of the spectator, the sign bore on the\r\nopposite side an emblematic device, resembling our first parents in\r\ntheir vegetable garments, with this legend--\r\n\r\n  \"Poor sinners whom the snake deceives,\r\n  Are fain to cover them with leaves.\r\n  Zetland hath no leaves, 'tis true,\r\n  Because that trees are none, or few;\r\n  But we have flax and taits of woo',\r\n  For linen cloth and wadmaal blue;\r\n  And we have many of foreign knacks\r\n  Of finer waft, than woo' or flax.\r\n  Ye gallanty Lambmas lads,[31] appear,\r\n  And bring your Lambmas sisters here;\r\n  Bryce Snailsfoot spares not cost or care,\r\n  To pleasure every gentle pair.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Cleveland was perusing these goodly rhymes, which brought to his\r\nmind Claud Halcro, to whom, as the poet laureate of the island, ready\r\nwith his talent alike in the service of the great and small, they\r\nprobably owed their origin, the worthy proprietor of the booth, having\r\ncast his eye upon him, began with hasty and trembling hand to remove\r\nsome of the garments, which, as the sale did not commence till the\r\nensuing day, he had exposed either for the purpose of airing them, or to\r\nexcite the admiration of the spectators.\r\n\r\n\"By my word, Captain,\" whispered Bunce to Cleveland, \"you must have had\r\nthat fellow under your clutches one day, and he remembers one gripe of\r\nyour talons, and fears another. See how fast he is packing his wares out\r\nof sight, so soon as he set eyes on you!\"\r\n\r\n\"_His_ wares!\" said Cleveland, on looking more attentively at his\r\nproceedings; \"By Heaven, they are my clothes which I left in a chest at\r\nJarlshof when the Revenge was lost there--Why, Bryce Snailsfoot, thou\r\nthief, dog, and villain, what means this? Have you not made enough of us\r\nby cheap buying and dear selling, that you have seized on my trunk and\r\nwearing apparel?\"\r\n\r\nBryce Snailsfoot, who probably would otherwise not have been willing to\r\n_see_ his friend the Captain, was now by the vivacity of his attack\r\nobliged to pay attention to him. He first whispered to his little\r\nfoot-page, by whom, as we have already noticed, he was usually attended,\r\n\"Run to the town-council-house, jarto, and tell the provost and bailies\r\nthey maun send some of their officers speedily, for here is like to be\r\nwild wark in the fair.\"\r\n\r\nSo having said, and having seconded his commands by a push on the\r\nshoulder of his messenger, which sent him spinning out of the shop as\r\nfast as heels could carry him, Bryce Snailsfoot turned to his old\r\nacquaintance, and, with that amplification of words and exaggeration of\r\nmanner, which in Scotland is called \"making a phrase,\" he\r\nejaculated--\"The Lord be gude to us! the worthy Captain Cleveland, that\r\nwe were all sae grieved about, returned to relieve our hearts again! Wat\r\nhave my cheeks been for you,\" (here Bryce wiped his eyes,) \"and blithe\r\nam I now to see you restored to your sorrowing friends!\"\r\n\r\n\"My sorrowing friends, you rascal!\" said Cleveland; \"I will give you\r\nbetter cause for sorrow than ever you had on my account, if you do not\r\ntell me instantly where you stole all my clothes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stole!\" ejaculated Bryce, casting up his eyes; \"now the Powers be gude\r\nto us!--the poor gentleman has lost his reason in that weary gale of\r\nwind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you insolent rascal!\" said Cleveland, grasping the cane which he\r\ncarried, \"do you think to bamboozle me with your impudence? As you would\r\nhave a whole head on your shoulders, and your bones in a whole skin, one\r\nminute longer, tell me where the devil you stole my wearing apparel?\"\r\n\r\nBryce Snailsfoot ejaculated once more a repetition of the word \"Stole!\r\nNow Heaven be gude to us!\" but at the same time, conscious that the\r\nCaptain was likely to be sudden in execution, cast an anxious look to\r\nthe town, to see the loitering aid of the civil power advance to his\r\nrescue.\r\n\r\n\"I insist on an instant answer,\" said the Captain, with upraised weapon,\r\n\"or else I will beat you to a mummy, and throw out all your frippery\r\nupon the common!\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Master John Bunce, who considered the whole affair as an\r\nexcellent good jest, and not the worse one that it made Cleveland very\r\nangry, seized hold of the Captain's arm, and, without any idea of\r\nultimately preventing him from executing his threats, interfered just so\r\nmuch as was necessary to protract a discussion so amusing.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, let the honest man speak,\" he said, \"messmate; he has as fine a\r\ncozening face as ever stood on a knavish pair of shoulders, and his are\r\nthe true flourishes of eloquence, in the course of which men snip the\r\ncloth an inch too short. Now, I wish you to consider that you are both\r\nof a trade,--he measures bales by the yard, and you by the sword,--and\r\nso I will not have him chopped up till he has had a fair chase.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a fool!\" said Cleveland, endeavouring to shake his friend\r\noff.--\"Let me go! for, by Heaven, I will be foul of him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold him fast,\" said the pedlar, \"good dear merry gentleman, hold him\r\nfast!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then say something for yourself,\" said Bunce; \"use your gob-box, man;\r\npatter away, or, by my soul, I will let him loose on you!\"\r\n\r\n\"He says I stole these goods,\" said Bryce, who now saw himself run so\r\nclose, that pleading to the charge became inevitable. \"Now, how could I\r\nsteal them, when they are mine by fair and lawful purchase?\"\r\n\r\n\"Purchase! you beggarly vagrant!\" said Cleveland; \"from whom did you\r\ndare to buy my clothes? or who had the impudence to sell them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just that worthy professor Mrs. Swertha, the housekeeper at Jarlshof,\r\nwho acted as your executor,\" said the pedlar; \"and a grieved heart she\r\nhad.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so she was resolved to make a heavy pocket of it, I suppose,\" said\r\nthe Captain; \"but how did she dare to sell the things left in her\r\ncharge?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, she acted all for the best, good woman!\" said the pedlar, anxious\r\nto protract the discussion until the arrival of succours; \"and, if you\r\nwill but hear reason, I am ready to account with you for the chest and\r\nall that it holds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak out, then, and let us have none of thy damnable evasions,\" said\r\nCaptain Cleveland; \"if you show ever so little purpose of being somewhat\r\nhonest for once in thy life, I will not beat thee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you see, noble Captain,\" said the pedlar,--and then muttered to\r\nhimself, \"plague on Pate Paterson's cripple knee, they will be waiting\r\nfor him, hirpling useless body!\" then resumed aloud--\"The country, you\r\nsee, is in great perplexity,--great perplexity, indeed,--much\r\nperplexity, truly. There was your honour missing, that was loved by\r\ngreat and small--clean missing--nowhere to be heard of--a lost\r\nman--umquhile--dead--defunct!\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall find me alive to your cost, you scoundrel!\" said the\r\nirritated Captain.\r\n\r\n\"Weel, but take patience,--ye will not hear a body speak,\" said the\r\nJagger.--\"Then there was the lad Mordaunt Mertoun\"----\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" said the Captain, \"what of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cannot be heard of,\" said the pedlar; \"clean and clear tint,--a gone\r\nyouth;--fallen, it is thought, from the craig into the sea--he was aye\r\nventurous. I have had dealings with him for furs and feathers, whilk he\r\nswapped against powder and shot, and the like; and now he has worn out\r\nfrom among us--clean retired--utterly vanished, like the last puff of an\r\nauld wife's tobacco pipe.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what is all this to the Captain's clothes, my dear friend?\" said\r\nBunce; \"I must presently beat you myself unless you come to the point.\"\r\n\r\n\"Weel, weel,--patience, patience,\" said Bryce, waving his hand; \"you\r\nwill get all time enough. Weel, there are two folks gane, as I said,\r\nforbye the distress at Burgh-Westra about Mistress Minna's sad\r\nailment\"----\r\n\r\n\"Bring not _her_ into your buffoonery, sirrah,\" said Cleveland, in a\r\ntone of anger, not so loud, but far deeper and more concentrated than he\r\nhad hitherto used; \"for, if you name her with less than reverence, I\r\nwill crop the ears out of your head, and make you swallow them on the\r\nspot!\"\r\n\r\n\"He, he, he!\" faintly laughed the Jagger; \"that were a pleasant jest!\r\nyou are pleased to be witty. But, to say naething of Burgh-Westra, there\r\nis the carle at Jarlshof, he that was the auld Mertoun, Mordaunt's\r\nfather, whom men thought as fast bound to the place he dwelt in as the\r\nSumburgh-head itsell, naething maun serve him but he is lost as weel as\r\nthe lave about whom I have spoken. And there's Magnus Troil (wi' favour\r\nbe he named) taking horse; and there is pleasant Maister Claud Halcro\r\ntaking boat, whilk he steers worst of any man in Zetland, his head\r\nrunning on rambling rhymes; and the Factor body is on the stir--the\r\nScots Factor,--him that is aye speaking of dikes and delving, and such\r\nunprofitable wark, which has naething of merchandise in it, and he is on\r\nthe lang trot, too; so that ye might say, upon a manner, the tae half of\r\nthe Mainland of Zetland is lost, and the other is running to and fro\r\nseeking it--awfu' times!\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Cleveland had subdued his passion, and listened to this tirade\r\nof the worthy man of merchandise, with impatience indeed, yet not\r\nwithout the hope of hearing something that might concern him. But his\r\ncompanion was now become impatient in his turn:--\"The clothes!\" he\r\nexclaimed, \"the clothes, the clothes, the clothes!\" accompanying each\r\nrepetition of the words with a flourish of his cane, the dexterity of\r\nwhich consisted in coming mighty near the Jagger's ears without actually\r\ntouching them.\r\n\r\nThe Jagger, shrinking from each of these demonstrations, continued to\r\nexclaim, \"Nay, sir--good sir--worthy sir--for the clothes--I found the\r\nworthy dame in great distress on account of her old maister, and on\r\naccount of her young maister, and on account of worthy Captain\r\nCleveland; and because of the distress of the worthy Fowd's family, and\r\nthe trouble of the great Fowd himself,--and because of the Factor, and\r\nin respect of Claud Halcro, and on other accounts and respects. Also we\r\nmingled our sorrows and our tears with a bottle, as the holy text hath\r\nit, and called in the Ranzelman to our council, a worthy man, Niel\r\nRonaldson by name, who hath a good reputation.\"\r\n\r\nHere another flourish of the cane came so very near that it partly\r\ntouched his ear. The Jagger started back, and the truth, or that which\r\nhe desired should be considered as such, bolted from him without more\r\ncircumlocution; as a cork, after much unnecessary buzzing and fizzing,\r\nsprings forth from a bottle of spruce beer.\r\n\r\n\"In brief, what the deil mair would you have of it?--the woman sold me\r\nthe kist of clothes--they are mine by purchase, and that is what I will\r\nlive and die upon.\"\r\n\r\n\"In other words,\" said Cleveland, \"this greedy old hag had the impudence\r\nto sell what was none of hers; and you, honest Bryce Snailsfoot, had the\r\nassurance to be the purchaser?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ou dear, Captain,\" said the conscientious pedlar, \"what wad ye hae had\r\ntwa poor folk to do? There was yoursell gane that aught the things, and\r\nMaister Mordaunt was gane that had them in keeping, and the things were\r\nbut damply put up, where they were rotting with moth and mould, and\"----\r\n\r\n\"And so this old thief sold them, and you bought them, I suppose, just\r\nto keep them from spoiling?\" said Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\"Weel then,\" said the merchant, \"I'm thinking, noble Captain, that wad\r\nbe just the gate of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well then, hark ye, you impudent scoundrel,\" said the Captain. \"I do\r\nnot wish to dirty my fingers with you, or to make any disturbance in\r\nthis place\"----\r\n\r\n\"Good reason for that, Captain--aha!\" said the Jagger, slyly.\r\n\r\n\"I will break your bones if you speak another word,\" replied Cleveland.\r\n\"Take notice--I offer you fair terms--give me back the black leathern\r\npocket-book with the lock upon it, and the purse with the doubloons,\r\nwith some few of the clothes I want, and keep the rest in the devil's\r\nname!\"\r\n\r\n\"Doubloons!!!\"--exclaimed the Jagger, with an exaltation of voice\r\nintended to indicate the utmost extremity of surprise,--\"What do I ken\r\nof doubloons? my dealing was for doublets, and not for doubloons--If\r\nthere were doubloons in the kist, doubtless Swertha will have them in\r\nsafe keeping for your honour--the damp wouldna harm the gold, ye ken.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me back my pocket-book and my goods, you rascally thief,\" said\r\nCleveland, \"or without a word more I will beat your brains out!\"\r\n\r\nThe wily Jagger, casting eye around him, saw that succour was near, in\r\nthe shape of a party of officers, six in number; for several rencontres\r\nwith the crew of the pirate had taught the magistrates of Kirkwall to\r\nstrengthen their police parties when these strangers were in question.\r\n\r\n\"Ye had better keep the _thief_ to suit yoursell, honoured Captain,\"\r\nsaid the Jagger, emboldened by the approach of the civil power; \"for wha\r\nkens how a' these fine goods and bonny-dies were come by?\"\r\n\r\nThis was uttered with such provoking slyness of look and tone, that\r\nCleveland made no further delay, but, seizing upon the Jagger by the\r\ncollar, dragged him over his temporary counter, which was, with all the\r\ngoods displayed thereon, overset in the scuffle; and, holding him with\r\none hand, inflicted on him with the other a severe beating with his\r\ncane. All this was done so suddenly and with such energy, that Bryce\r\nSnailsfoot, though rather a stout man, was totally surprised by the\r\nvivacity of the attack, and made scarce any other effort at extricating\r\nhimself than by roaring for assistance like a bull-calf. The \"loitering\r\naid\" having at length come up, the officers made an effort to seize on\r\nCleveland, and by their united exertions succeeded in compelling him to\r\nquit hold of the pedlar, in order to defend himself from their assault.\r\nThis he did with infinite strength, resolution, and dexterity, being at\r\nthe same time well seconded by his friend Jack Bunce, who had seen with\r\nglee the drubbing sustained by the pedlar, and now combated tightly to\r\nsave his companion from the consequences. But, as there had been for\r\nsome time a growing feud between the townspeople and the crew of the\r\nRover, the former, provoked by the insolent deportment of the seamen,\r\nhad resolved to stand by each other, and to aid the civil power upon\r\nsuch occasions of riot as should occur in future; and so many assistants\r\ncame up to the rescue of the constables, that Cleveland, after fighting\r\nmost manfully, was at length brought to the ground and made prisoner.\r\nHis more fortunate companion had escaped by speed of foot, as soon as he\r\nsaw that the day must needs be determined against them.\r\n\r\nThe proud heart of Cleveland, which, even in its perversion, had in its\r\nfeelings something of original nobleness, was like to burst, when he\r\nfelt himself borne down in this unworthy brawl--dragged into the town as\r\na prisoner, and hurried through the streets towards the Council-house,\r\nwhere the magistrates of the burgh were then seated in council. The\r\nprobability of imprisonment, with all its consequences, rushed also upon\r\nhis mind, and he cursed an hundred times the folly which had not rather\r\nsubmitted to the pedlar's knavery, than involved him in so perilous an\r\nembarrassment.\r\n\r\nBut just as they approached the door of the Council-house, which is\r\nsituated in the middle of the little town, the face of matters was\r\nsuddenly changed by a new and unexpected incident.\r\n\r\nBunce, who had designed, by his precipitate retreat, to serve as well\r\nhis friend as himself, had hied him to the haven, where the boat of the\r\nRover was then lying, and called the cockswain and boat's crew to the\r\nassistance of Cleveland. They now appeared on the scene--fierce\r\ndesperadoes, as became their calling, with features bronzed by the\r\ntropical sun under which they had pursued it. They rushed at once\r\namongst the crowd, laying about them with their stretchers; and, forcing\r\ntheir way up to Cleveland, speedily delivered him from the hands of the\r\nofficers, who were totally unprepared to resist an attack so furious and\r\nso sudden, and carried him off in triumph towards the quay,--two or\r\nthree of their number facing about from time to time to keep back the\r\ncrowd, whose efforts to recover the prisoner were the less violent, that\r\nmost of the seamen were armed with pistols and cutlasses, as well as\r\nwith the less lethal weapons which alone they had as yet made use of.\r\n\r\nThey gained their boat in safety, and jumped into it, carrying along\r\nwith them Cleveland, to whom circumstances seemed to offer no other\r\nrefuge, and pushed off for their vessel, singing in chorus to their oars\r\nan old ditty, of which the natives of Kirkwall could only hear the first\r\nstanza:\r\n\r\n  \"Robin Rover\r\n    Said to his crew,\r\n  'Up with the black flag,\r\n    Down with the blue!--\r\n  Fire on the main-top,\r\n    Fire on the bow,\r\n  Fire on the gun-deck,\r\n    Fire down below!'\"\r\n\r\nThe wild chorus of their voices was heard long after the words ceased to\r\nbe intelligible.--And thus was the pirate Cleveland again thrown almost\r\ninvoluntarily amongst those desperate associates, from whom he had so\r\noften resolved to detach himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[31] It was anciently a custom at Saint Olla's Fair at Kirkwall, that\r\nthe young people of the lower class, and of either sex, associated in\r\npairs for the period of the Fair, during which the couple were termed\r\nLambmas brother and sister. It is easy to conceive that the exclusive\r\nfamiliarity arising out of this custom was liable to abuse, the rather\r\nthat it is said little scandal was attached to the indiscretions which\r\nit occasioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n  Parental love, my friend, has power o'er wisdom,\r\n  And is the charm, which, like the falconer's lure,\r\n  Can bring from heaven the highest soaring spirits.--\r\n  So, when famed Prosper doff'd his magic robe,\r\n  It was Miranda pluck'd it from his shoulders.\r\n\r\n                                                 _Old Play._\r\n\r\n\r\nOur wandering narrative must now return to Mordaunt Mertoun.--We left\r\nhim in the perilous condition of one who has received a severe wound,\r\nand we now find him in the condition of a convalescent--pale, indeed,\r\nand feeble from the loss of much blood, and the effects of a fever which\r\nhad followed the injury, but so far fortunate, that the weapon, having\r\nglanced on the ribs, had only occasioned a great effusion of blood,\r\nwithout touching any vital part, and was now wellnigh healed; so\r\nefficacious were the vulnerary plants and salves with which it had been\r\ntreated by the sage Norna of Fitful-head.\r\n\r\nThe matron and her patient now sat together in a dwelling in a remote\r\nisland. He had been transported, during his illness, and ere he had\r\nperfect consciousness, first to her singular habitation near\r\nFitful-head, and thence to her present abode, by one of the\r\nfishing-boats on the station of Burgh-Westra. For such was the command\r\npossessed by Norna over the superstitious character of her countrymen,\r\nthat she never failed to find faithful agents to execute her commands,\r\nwhatever these happened to be; and, as her orders were generally given\r\nunder injunctions of the strictest secrecy, men reciprocally wondered at\r\noccurrences, which had in fact been produced by their own agency, and\r\nthat of their neighbours, and in which, had they communicated freely\r\nwith each other, no shadow of the marvellous would have remained.\r\n\r\nMordaunt was now seated by the fire, in an apartment indifferently well\r\nfurnished, having a book in his hand, which he looked upon from time to\r\ntime with signs of ennui and impatience; feelings which at length so far\r\novercame him, that, flinging the volume on the table, he fixed his eyes\r\non the fire, and assumed the attitude of one who is engaged in\r\nunpleasant meditation.\r\n\r\nNorna, who sat opposite to him, and appeared busy in the composition of\r\nsome drug or unguent, anxiously left her seat, and, approaching\r\nMordaunt, felt his pulse, making at the same time the most affectionate\r\nenquiries whether he felt any sudden pain, and where it was seated. The\r\nmanner in which Mordaunt replied to these earnest enquiries, although\r\nworded so as to express gratitude for her kindness, while he disclaimed\r\nany feeling of indisposition, did not seem to give satisfaction to the\r\nPythoness.\r\n\r\n\"Ungrateful boy!\" she said, \"for whom I have done so much; you whom I\r\nhave rescued, by my power and skill, from the very gates of death,--are\r\nyou already so weary of me, that you cannot refrain from showing how\r\ndesirous you are to spend, at a distance from me, the very first\r\nintelligent days of the life which I have restored you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You do me injustice, my kind preserver,\" replied Mordaunt; \"I am not\r\ntired of your society; but I have duties which recall me to ordinary\r\nlife.\"\r\n\r\n\"Duties!\" repeated Norna; \"and what duties can or ought to interfere\r\nwith the gratitude which you owe to me?--Duties! Your thoughts are on\r\nthe use of your gun, or on clambering among the rocks in quest of\r\nsea-fowl. For these exercises your strength doth not yet fit you; and\r\nyet these are the duties to which you are so anxious to return!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so, my good and kind mistress,\" said Mordaunt.--\"To name one duty,\r\nout of many, which makes me seek to leave you, now that my strength\r\npermits, let me mention that of a son to his father.\"\r\n\r\n\"To your father!\" said Norna, with a laugh that had something in it\r\nalmost frantic. \"O! you know not how we can, in these islands, at once\r\ncancel such duties! And, for your father,\" she added, proceeding more\r\ncalmly, \"what has he done for you, to deserve the regard and duty you\r\nspeak of?--Is he not the same, who, as you have long since told me, left\r\nyou for so many years poorly nourished among strangers, without\r\nenquiring whether you were alive or dead, and only sending, from time to\r\ntime, supplies in such fashion, as men relieve the leprous wretch to\r\nwhom they fling alms from a distance? And, in these later years, when he\r\nhad made you the companion of his misery, he has been, by starts your\r\npedagogue, by starts your tormentor, but never, Mordaunt, never your\r\nfather.\"\r\n\r\n\"Something of truth there is in what you say,\" replied Mordaunt: \"My\r\nfather is not fond; but he is, and has ever been, effectively kind. Men\r\nhave not their affections in their power; and it is a child's duty to be\r\ngrateful for the benefits which he receives, even when coldly bestowed.\r\nMy father has conferred instruction on me, and I am convinced he loves\r\nme. He is unfortunate; and, even if he loved me not\"----\r\n\r\n\"And he does _not_ love you,\" said Norna, hastily; \"he never loved any\r\nthing, or any one, save himself. He is unfortunate, but well are his\r\nmisfortunes deserved.--O Mordaunt, you have one parent only,--one\r\nparent, who loves you as the drops of the heart-blood!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know I have but one parent,\" replied Mordaunt; \"my mother has been\r\nlong dead.--But your words contradict each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"They do not--they do not,\" said Norna, in a paroxysm of the deepest\r\nfeeling; \"you have but one parent. Your unhappy mother is not dead--I\r\nwould to God that she were!--but she is not dead. Thy mother is the only\r\nparent that loves thee; and I--I, Mordaunt,\" throwing herself on his\r\nneck, \"am that most unhappy--yet most happy mother.\"\r\n\r\nShe closed him in a strict and convulsive embrace; and tears, the first,\r\nperhaps, which she had shed for many years, burst in torrents as she\r\nsobbed on his neck. Astonished at what he heard, felt, and saw,--moved\r\nby the excess of her agitation, yet disposed to ascribe this burst of\r\npassion to insanity,--Mordaunt vainly endeavoured to tranquillize the\r\nmind of this extraordinary person.\r\n\r\n\"Ungrateful boy!\" she said, \"who but a mother would have watched over\r\nthee as I have watched? From the instant I saw thy father, when he\r\nlittle thought by whom he was observed, a space now many years back, I\r\nknew him well; and, under his charge, I saw you, then a\r\nstripling,--while Nature, speaking loud in my bosom, assured me, thou\r\nwert blood of my blood, and bone of my bone. Think how often you have\r\nwondered to see me, when least expected, in your places of pastime and\r\nresort! Think how often my eye has watched you on the giddy precipices,\r\nand muttered those charms which subdue the evil demons, who show\r\nthemselves to the climber on the giddiest point of his path, and force\r\nhim to quit his hold! Did I not hang around thy neck, in pledge of thy\r\nsafety, that chain of gold, which an Elfin King gave to the founder of\r\nour race? Would I have given that dear gift to any but to the son of my\r\nbosom?--Mordaunt, my power has done that for thee that a mere mortal\r\nmother would dread to think of. I have conjured the Mermaid at midnight,\r\nthat thy bark might be prosperous on the Haaf! I have hushed the winds,\r\nand navies have flapped their empty sails against the mast in\r\ninactivity, that you might safely indulge your sport upon the crags!\"\r\n\r\nMordaunt, perceiving that she was growing yet wilder in her talk,\r\nendeavoured to frame an answer which should be at once indulgent,\r\nsoothing, and calculated to allay the rising warmth of her imagination.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Norna,\" he said, \"I have indeed many reasons to call you mother,\r\nwho have bestowed so many benefits upon me; and from me you shall ever\r\nreceive the affection and duty of a child. But the chain you mentioned,\r\nit has vanished from my neck--I have not seen it since the ruffian\r\nstabbed me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! and can you think of it at this moment?\" said Norna, in a\r\nsorrowful accent.--\"But be it so;--and know, it was I took it from thy\r\nneck, and tied it around the neck of her who is dearest to you; in token\r\nthat the union betwixt you, which has been the only earthly wish which\r\nI have had the power to form, shall yet, even yet, be accomplished--ay,\r\nalthough hell should open to forbid the bans!\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas!\" said Mordaunt, with a sigh, \"you remember not the difference\r\nbetwixt our situation--her father is wealthy, and of ancient birth.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not more wealthy than will be the heir of Norna of Fitful-head,\"\r\nanswered the Pythoness--\"not of better or more ancient blood than that\r\nwhich flows in thy veins, derived from thy mother, the descendant of the\r\nsame Jarls and Sea-Kings from whom Magnus boasts his origin.--Or dost\r\nthou think, like the pedant and fanatic strangers who have come amongst\r\nus, that thy blood is dishonoured because my union with thy father did\r\nnot receive the sanction of a priest?--Know, that we were wedded after\r\nthe ancient manner of the Norse--our hands were clasped within the\r\ncircle of Odin,[32] with such deep vows of eternal fidelity, as even the\r\nlaws of these usurping Scots would have sanctioned as equivalent to a\r\nblessing before the altar. To the offspring of such a union, Magnus has\r\nnought to object. It was weak--it was criminal, on my part, but it\r\nconveyed no infamy to the birth of my son.\"\r\n\r\nThe composed and collected manner in which Norna argued these points\r\nbegan to impose upon Mordaunt an incipient belief in the truth of what\r\nshe said; and, indeed, she added so many circumstances, satisfactorily\r\nand rationally connected with each other, as seemed to confute the\r\nnotion that her story was altogether the delusion of that insanity which\r\nsometimes showed itself in her speech and actions. A thousand confused\r\nideas rushed upon him, when he supposed it possible that the unhappy\r\nperson before him might actually have a right to claim from him the\r\nrespect and affection due to a parent from a son. He could only surmount\r\nthem by turning his mind to a different, and scarce less interesting\r\ntopic, resolving within himself to take time for farther enquiry and\r\nmature consideration, ere he either rejected or admitted the claim which\r\nNorna preferred upon his affection and duty. His benefactress, at least,\r\nshe undoubtedly was, and he could not err in paying her, as such, the\r\nrespect and attention due from a son to a mother; and so far, therefore,\r\nhe might gratify Norna without otherwise standing committed.\r\n\r\n\"And do you then really think, my mother,--since so you bid me term\r\nyou,\"--said Mordaunt, \"that the proud Magnus Troil may, by any\r\ninducement, be prevailed upon to relinquish the angry feelings which he\r\nhas of late adopted towards me, and to permit my addresses to his\r\ndaughter Brenda?\"\r\n\r\n\"Brenda?\" repeated Norna--\"who talks of Brenda?--it was of Minna that I\r\nspoke to you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it was of Brenda that I thought,\" replied Mordaunt, \"of her that I\r\nnow think, and of her alone that I will ever think.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible, my son!\" replied Norna. \"You cannot be so dull of heart, so\r\npoor of spirit, as to prefer the idle mirth and housewife simplicity of\r\nthe younger sister, to the deep feeling and high mind of the\r\nnoble-spirited Minna? Who would stoop to gather the lowly violet, that\r\nmight have the rose for stretching out his hand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some think the lowliest flowers are the sweetest,\" replied Mordaunt,\r\n\"and in that faith will I live and die.\"\r\n\r\n\"You dare not tell me so!\" answered Norna, fiercely; then, instantly\r\nchanging her tone, and taking his hand in the most affectionate manner,\r\nshe proceeded:--\"You must not--you will not tell me so, my dear son--you\r\nwill not break a mother's heart in the very first hour in which she has\r\nembraced her child!--Nay, do not answer, but hear me. You must wed\r\nMinna--I have bound around her neck a fatal amulet, on which the\r\nhappiness of both depends. The labours of my life have for years had\r\nthis direction. Thus it must be, and not otherwise--Minna must be the\r\nbride of my son!\"\r\n\r\n\"But is not Brenda equally near, equally dear to you?\" replied Mordaunt.\r\n\r\n\"As near in blood,\" said Norna, \"but not so dear, no not half so dear,\r\nin affection. Minna's mild, yet high and contemplative spirit, renders\r\nher a companion meet for one, whose ways, like mine, are beyond the\r\nordinary paths of this world. Brenda is a thing of common and ordinary\r\nlife, an idle laugher and scoffer, who would level art with ignorance,\r\nand reduce power to weakness, by disbelieving and turning into ridicule\r\nwhatever is beyond the grasp of her own shallow intellect.\"\r\n\r\n\"She is, indeed,\" answered Mordaunt, \"neither superstitious nor\r\nenthusiastic, and I love her the better for it. Remember also, my\r\nmother, that she returns my affection, and that Minna, if she loves any\r\none, loves the stranger Cleveland.\"\r\n\r\n\"She does not--she dares not,\" answered Norna, \"nor dares he pursue her\r\nfarther. I told him, when first he came to Burgh-Westra, that I destined\r\nher for you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to that rash annunciation,\" said Mordaunt, \"I owe this man's\r\npersevering enmity--my wound, and wellnigh the loss of my life. See, my\r\nmother, to what point your intrigues have already conducted us, and, in\r\nHeaven's name, prosecute them no farther!\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if this reproach struck Norna with the force, at once, and\r\nvivacity of lightning; for she struck her forehead with her hand, and\r\nseemed about to drop from her seat. Mordaunt, greatly shocked, hastened\r\nto catch her in his arms, and, though scarce knowing what to say,\r\nattempted to utter some incoherent expressions.\r\n\r\n\"Spare me, Heaven, spare me!\" were the first words which she muttered;\r\n\"do not let my crime be avenged by his means!--Yes, young man,\" she\r\nsaid, after a pause, \"you have dared to tell what I dared not tell\r\nmyself. You have pressed that upon me, which, if it be truth, I cannot\r\nbelieve, and yet continue to live!\"\r\n\r\nMordaunt in vain endeavoured to interrupt her with protestations of his\r\nignorance how he had offended or grieved her, and of his extreme regret\r\nthat he had unintentionally done either. She proceeded, while her voice\r\ntrembled wildly, with vehemence.\r\n\r\n\"Yes! you have touched on that dark suspicion which poisons the\r\nconsciousness of my power,--the sole boon which was given me in exchange\r\nfor innocence and for peace of mind! Your voice joins that of the demon\r\nwhich, even while the elements confess me their mistress, whispers to\r\nme, 'Norna, this is but delusion--your power rests but in the idle\r\nbelief of the ignorant, supported by a thousand petty artifices of your\r\nown.'--This is what Brenda says--this is what you would say; and false,\r\nscandalously false, as it is, there are rebellious thoughts in this wild\r\nbrain of mine,\" (touching her forehead with her finger as she spoke,)\r\n\"that, like an insurrection in an invaded country, arise to take part\r\nagainst their distressed sovereign.--Spare me, my son!\" she continued in\r\na voice of supplication, \"spare me!--the sovereignty of which your words\r\nwould deprive me, is no enviable exaltation. Few would covet to rule\r\nover gibbering ghosts, and howling winds, and raging currents. My throne\r\nis a cloud, my sceptre a meteor, my realm is only peopled with\r\nfantasies; but I must either cease to be, or continue to be the\r\nmightiest as well as the most miserable of beings!\"[33]\r\n\r\n\"Do not speak thus mournfully, my dear and unhappy benefactress,\" said\r\nMordaunt, much affected; \"I will think of your power whatever you would\r\nhave me believe. But, for your own sake, view the matter otherwise. Turn\r\nyour thoughts from such agitating and mystical studies--from such wild\r\nsubjects of contemplation, into another and a better channel. Life will\r\nagain have charms, and religion will have comforts, for you.\"\r\n\r\nShe listened to him with some composure, as if she weighed his counsel,\r\nand desired to be guided by it; but, as he ended, she shook her head and\r\nexclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"It cannot be. I must remain the dreaded--the mystical--the\r\nReimkennar--the controller of the elements, or I must be no more! I have\r\nno alternative, no middle station. My post must be high on yon lofty\r\nheadland, where never stood human foot save mine--or I must sleep at the\r\nbottom of the unfathomable ocean, its white billows booming over my\r\nsenseless corpse. The parricide shall never also be denounced as the\r\nimpostor!\"\r\n\r\n\"The parricide!\" echoed Mordaunt, stepping back in horror.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my son!\" answered Norna, with a stern composure, even more\r\nfrightful than her former impetuosity, \"within these fatal walls my\r\nfather met his death by my means. In yonder chamber was he found a livid\r\nand lifeless corpse. Beware of filial disobedience, for such are its\r\nfruits!\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, she arose and left the apartment, where Mordaunt remained\r\nalone to meditate at leisure upon the extraordinary communication which\r\nhe had received. He himself had been taught by his father a disbelief in\r\nthe ordinary superstitions of Zetland; and he now saw that Norna,\r\nhowever ingenious in duping others, could not altogether impose on\r\nherself. This was a strong circumstance in favour of her sanity of\r\nintellect; but, on the other hand, her imputing to herself the guilt of\r\nparricide seemed so wild and improbable, as, in Mordaunt's opinion, to\r\nthrow much doubt upon her other assertions.\r\n\r\nHe had leisure enough to make up his mind on these particulars, for no\r\none approached the solitary dwelling, of which Norna, her dwarf, and he\r\nhimself, were the sole inhabitants. The Hoy island in which it stood is\r\nrude, bold, and lofty, consisting entirely of three hills--or rather one\r\nhuge mountain divided into three summits, with the chasms, rents, and\r\nvalleys, which descend from its summit to the sea, while its crest,\r\nrising to great height, and shivered into rocks which seem almost\r\ninaccessible, intercepts the mists as they drive from the Atlantic,\r\nand, often obscured from the human eye, forms the dark and unmolested\r\nretreat of hawks, eagles, and other birds of prey.[34]\r\n\r\nThe soil of the island is wet, mossy, cold, and unproductive, presenting\r\na sterile and desolate appearance, excepting where the sides of small\r\nrivulets, or mountain ravines, are fringed with dwarf bushes of birch,\r\nhazel, and wild currant, some of them so tall as to be denominated\r\ntrees, in that bleak and bare country.\r\n\r\nBut the view of the sea-beach, which was Mordaunt's favourite walk, when\r\nhis convalescent state began to permit him to take exercise, had charms\r\nwhich compensated the wild appearance of the interior. A broad and\r\nbeautiful sound, or strait, divides this lonely and mountainous island\r\nfrom Pomona, and in the centre of that sound lies, like a tablet\r\ncomposed of emerald, the beautiful and verdant little island of Græmsay.\r\nOn the distant Mainland is seen the town or village of Stromness, the\r\nexcellence of whose haven is generally evinced by a considerable number\r\nof shipping in the roadstead, and, from the bay growing narrower, and\r\nlessening as it recedes, runs inland into Pomona, where its tide fills\r\nthe fine sheet of water called the Loch of Stennis.\r\n\r\nOn this beach Mordaunt was wont to wander for hours, with an eye not\r\ninsensible to the beauties of the view, though his thoughts were\r\nagitated with the most embarrassing meditations on his own situation. He\r\nwas resolved to leave the island as soon as the establishment of his\r\nhealth should permit him to travel; yet gratitude to Norna, of whom he\r\nwas at least the adopted, if not the real son, would not allow him to\r\ndepart without her permission, even if he could obtain means of\r\nconveyance, of which he saw little possibility. It was only by\r\nimportunity that he extorted from his hostess a promise, that, if he\r\nwould consent to regulate his motions according to her directions, she\r\nwould herself convey him to the capital of the Orkney Islands, when the\r\napproaching Fair of Saint Olla should take place there.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[32] See an explanation of this promise, Note II. of this volume.\r\n\r\n[33] Note V.--Character of Norna.\r\n\r\n[34] Note VI.--Birds of Prey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n  Hark to the insult loud, the bitter sneer,\r\n  The fierce threat answering to the brutal jeer;\r\n  Oaths fly like pistol-shots, and vengeful words\r\n  Clash with each other like conflicting swords--\r\n  The robber's quarrel by such sounds is shown,\r\n  And true men have some chance to gain their own.\r\n\r\n                                        _Captivity, a Poem._\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Cleveland, borne off in triumph from his assailants in Kirkwall,\r\nfound himself once more on board the pirate-vessel, his arrival was\r\nhailed with hearty cheers by a considerable part of the crew, who rushed\r\nto shake hands with him, and offer their congratulations on his return;\r\nfor the situation of a Buccanier Captain raised him very little above\r\nthe level of the lowest of his crew, who, in all social intercourse,\r\nclaimed the privilege of being his equal.\r\n\r\nWhen his faction, for so these clamorous friends might be termed, had\r\nexpressed their own greetings, they hurried Cleveland forward to the\r\nstern, where Goffe, their present commander, was seated on a gun,\r\nlistening in a sullen and discontented mood to the shout which announced\r\nCleveland's welcome. He was a man betwixt forty and fifty, rather under\r\nthe middle size, but so very strongly made, that his crew used to\r\ncompare him to a sixty-four cut down. Black-haired, bull-necked, and\r\nbeetle-browed, his clumsy strength and ferocious countenance contrasted\r\nstrongly with the manly figure and open countenance of Cleveland, in\r\nwhich even the practice of his atrocious profession had not been able to\r\neradicate a natural grace of motion and generosity of expression. The\r\ntwo piratical Captains looked upon each other for some time in silence,\r\nwhile the partisans of each gathered around him. The elder part of the\r\ncrew were the principal adherents of Goffe, while the young fellows,\r\namong whom Jack Bunce was a principal leader and agitator, were in\r\ngeneral attached to Cleveland.\r\n\r\nAt length Goffe broke silence.--\"You are welcome aboard, Captain\r\nCleveland.--Smash my taffrail! I suppose you think yourself commodore\r\nyet! but that was over, by G--, when you lost your ship, and be\r\nd----d!\"\r\n\r\nAnd here, once for all, we may take notice, that it was the gracious\r\ncustom of this commander to mix his words and oaths in nearly equal\r\nproportions, which he was wont to call _shotting_ his discourse. As we\r\ndelight not, however, in the discharge of such artillery, we shall only\r\nindicate by a space like this ---- the places in which these expletives\r\noccurred; and thus, if the reader will pardon a very poor pun, we will\r\nreduce Captain Goffe's volley of sharp-shot into an explosion of blank\r\ncartridges. To his insinuations that he was come on board to assume the\r\nchief command, Cleveland replied, that he neither desired, nor would\r\naccept, any such promotion, but would only ask Captain Goffe for a cast\r\nof the boat, to put him ashore in one of the other islands, as he had no\r\nwish either to command Goffe, or to remain in a vessel under his orders.\r\n\r\n\"And why not under my orders, brother?\" demanded Goffe, very austerely;\r\n\"-- -- -- are you too good a man, -- -- -- with your cheese-toaster and\r\nyour jib there, -- -- to serve under my orders, and be d----d to you,\r\nwhere there are so many gentlemen that are elder and better seamen than\r\nyourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder which of these capital seamen it was,\" said Cleveland, coolly,\r\n\"that laid the ship under the fire of yon six-gun battery, that could\r\nblow her out of the water, if they had a mind, before you could either\r\ncut or slip? Elder and better sailors than I may like to serve under\r\nsuch a lubber, but I beg to be excused for my own share, Captain--that's\r\nall I have got to tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"By G--, I think you are both mad!\" said Hawkins the boatswain--\"a\r\nmeeting with sword and pistol may be devilish good fun in its way, when\r\nno better is to be had; but who the devil that had common sense, amongst\r\na set of gentlemen in our condition, would fall a quarrelling with each\r\nother, to let these duck-winged, web-footed islanders have a chance of\r\nknocking us all upon the head?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well said, old Hawkins!\" observed Derrick the quarter-master, who was\r\nan officer of very considerable importance among these rovers; \"I say,\r\nif the two captains won't agree to live together quietly, and club both\r\nheart and head to defend the vessel, why, d----n me, depose them both,\r\nsay I, and choose another in their stead!\"\r\n\r\n\"Meaning yourself, I suppose, Master Quarter-Master!\" said Jack Bunce;\r\n\"but that cock won't fight. He that is to command gentlemen, should be a\r\ngentleman himself, I think; and I give my vote for Captain Cleveland, as\r\nspirited and as gentleman-like a man as ever daffed the world aside, and\r\nbid it pass!\"\r\n\r\n\"What! _you_ call yourself a gentleman, I warrant!\" retorted Derrick;\r\n\"why, ---- your eyes! a tailor would make a better out of the worst suit\r\nof rags in your strolling wardrobe!--It is a shame for men of spirit to\r\nhave such a Jack-a-dandy scarecrow on board!\"\r\n\r\nJack Bunce was so incensed at these base comparisons, that without more\r\nado, he laid his hand on his sword. The carpenter, however, and\r\nboatswain, interfered, the former brandishing his broad axe, and\r\nswearing he would put the skull of the first who should strike a blow\r\npast clouting, and the latter reminding them, that, by their articles,\r\nall quarrelling, striking, or more especially fighting, on board, was\r\nstrictly prohibited; and that, if any gentleman had a quarrel to settle,\r\nthey were to go ashore, and decide it with cutlass and pistol in\r\npresence of two of their messmates.\r\n\r\n\"I have no quarrel with any one, -- -- --!\" said Goffe, sullenly;\r\n\"Captain Cleveland has wandered about among the islands here, amusing\r\nhimself, -- -- --! and we have wasted our time and property in waiting\r\nfor him, when we might have been adding twenty or thirty thousand\r\ndollars to the stock-purse. However, if it pleases the rest of the\r\ngentlemen-adventurers, -- -- --! why, I shall not grumble about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I propose,\" said the boatswain, \"that there should be a general council\r\ncalled in the great cabin, according to our articles, that we may\r\nconsider what course we are to hold in this matter.\"\r\n\r\nA general assent followed the boatswain's proposal; for every one found\r\nhis own account in these general councils, in which each of the rovers\r\nhad a free vote. By far the greater part of the crew only valued this\r\nfranchise, as it allowed them, upon such solemn occasions, an unlimited\r\nquantity of liquor--a right which they failed not to exercise to the\r\nuttermost, by way of aiding their deliberations. But a few amongst the\r\nadventurers, who united some degree of judgment with the daring and\r\nprofligate character of their profession, were wont, at such periods, to\r\nlimit themselves within the bounds of comparative sobriety, and by\r\nthese, under the apparent form of a vote of the general council, all\r\nthings of moment relating to the voyage and undertakings of the pirates\r\nwere in fact determined. The rest of the crew, when they recovered from\r\ntheir intoxication, were easily persuaded that the resolution adopted\r\nhad been the legitimate effort of the combined wisdom of the whole\r\nsenate.\r\n\r\nUpon the present occasion the debauch had proceeded until the greater\r\npart of the crew were, as usual, displaying inebriation in all its most\r\nbrutal and disgraceful shapes--swearing empty and unmeaning\r\noaths--venting the most horrid imprecations in the mere gaiety of their\r\nheart--singing songs, the ribaldry of which was only equalled by their\r\nprofaneness; and, from the middle of this earthly hell, the two\r\ncaptains, together with one or two of their principal adherents, as also\r\nthe carpenter and boatswain, who always took a lead on such occasions,\r\nhad drawn together into a pandemonium, or privy council of their own, to\r\nconsider what was to be done; for, as the boatswain metaphorically\r\nobserved, they were in a narrow channel, and behoved to keep sounding\r\nthe tide-way.\r\n\r\nWhen they began their consultations, the friends of Goffe remarked, to\r\ntheir great displeasure, that he had not observed the wholesome rule to\r\nwhich we have just alluded; but that, in endeavouring to drown his\r\nmortification at the sudden appearance of Cleveland, and the reception\r\nhe met with from the crew, the elder Captain had not been able to do so\r\nwithout overflowing his reason at the same time. His natural sullen\r\ntaciturnity had prevented this from being observed until the council\r\nbegan its deliberations, when it proved impossible to hide it.\r\n\r\nThe first person who spoke was Cleveland, who said, that, so far from\r\nwishing the command of the vessel, he desired no favour at any one's\r\nhand, except to land him upon some island or holm at a distance from\r\nKirkwall, and leave him to shift for himself.\r\n\r\nThe boatswain remonstrated strongly against this resolution. \"The lads,\"\r\nhe said, \"all knew Cleveland, and could trust his seamanship, as well as\r\nhis courage; besides, he never let the grog get quite uppermost, and was\r\nalways in proper trim, either to sail the ship, or to fight the ship,\r\nwhereby she was never without some one to keep her course when he was on\r\nboard.--And as for the noble Captain Goffe,\" continued the mediator, \"he\r\nis as stout a heart as ever broke biscuit, and that I will uphold him;\r\nbut then, when he has his grog aboard--I speak to his face--he is so\r\nd----d funny with his cranks and his jests, that there is no living with\r\nhim. You all remember how nigh he had run the ship on that cursed Horse\r\nof Copinsha, as they call it, just by way of frolic; and then you know\r\nhow he fired off his pistol under the table, when we were at the great\r\ncouncil, and shot Jack Jenkins in the knee, and cost the poor devil his\r\nleg, with his pleasantry.\"[35]\r\n\r\n\"Jack Jenkins was not a chip the worse,\" said the carpenter; \"I took the\r\nleg off with my saw as well as any loblolly-boy in the land could have\r\ndone--heated my broad axe, and seared the stump--ay, by ----! and made a\r\njury-leg that he shambles about with as well as ever he did--for Jack\r\ncould never cut a feather.\"[36]\r\n\r\n\"You are a clever fellow, carpenter,\" replied the boatswain, \"a d----d\r\nclever fellow! but I had rather you tried your saw and red-hot axe upon\r\nthe ship's knee-timbers than on mine, sink me!--But that here is not the\r\ncase--The question is, if we shall part with Captain Cleveland here, who\r\nis a man of thought and action, whereby it is my belief it would be\r\nheaving the pilot overboard when the gale is blowing on a lee-shore.\r\nAnd, I must say, it is not the part of a true heart to leave his mates,\r\nwho have been here waiting for him till they have missed stays. Our\r\nwater is wellnigh out, and we have junketed till provisions are low with\r\nus. We cannot sail without provisions--we cannot get provisions without\r\nthe good-will of the Kirkwall folks. If we remain here longer, the\r\nHalcyon frigate will be down upon us--she was seen off Peterhead two\r\ndays since,--and we shall hang up at the yard-arm to be sun-dried. Now,\r\nCaptain Cleveland will get us out of the hobble, if any can. He can play\r\nthe gentleman with these Kirkwall folks, and knows how to deal with them\r\non fair terms, and foul, too, if there be occasion for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so you would turn honest Captain Goffe a-grazing, would ye?\" said\r\nan old weatherbeaten pirate, who had but one eye; \"what though he has\r\nhis humours, and made my eye dowse the glim in his fancies and frolics,\r\nhe is as honest a man as ever walked a quarter-deck, for all that; and\r\nd----n me but I stand by him so long as t'other lantern is lit!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, you would not hear me out,\" said Hawkins; \"a man might as well\r\ntalk to so many negers!--I tell you, I propose that Cleveland shall only\r\nbe Captain from one, _post meridiem_, to five _a. m._, during which time\r\nGoffe is always drunk.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain of whom he last spoke gave sufficient proof of the truth of\r\nhis words, by uttering an inarticulate growl, and attempting to present\r\na pistol at the mediator Hawkins.\r\n\r\n\"Why, look ye now!\" said Derrick, \"there is all the sense he has, to get\r\ndrunk on council-day, like one of these poor silly fellows!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" said Bunce, \"drunk as Davy's sow, in the face of the field, the\r\nfray, and the senate!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, nevertheless,\" continued Derrick, \"it will never do to have two\r\ncaptains in the same day. I think week about might suit better--and let\r\nCleveland take the first turn.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are as good here as any of them,\" said Hawkins; \"howsomdever, I\r\nobject nothing to Captain Cleveland, and I think he may help us into\r\ndeep water as well as another.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay,\" exclaimed Bunce, \"and a better figure he will make at bringing\r\nthese Kirkwallers to order than his sober predecessor!--So Captain\r\nCleveland for ever!\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\"Stop, gentlemen,\" said Cleveland, who had hitherto been silent; \"I\r\nhope you will not choose me Captain without my own consent?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, by the blue vault of heaven will we,\" said Bunce, \"if it be _pro\r\nbono publico_!\"\r\n\r\n\"But hear me, at least,\" said Cleveland--\"I do consent to take command\r\nof the vessel, since you wish it, and because I see you will ill get out\r\nof the scrape without me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then, I say, Cleveland for ever, again!\" shouted Bunce.\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet, prithee, dear Bunce!--honest Altamont!\" said Cleveland.--\"I\r\nundertake the business on this condition; that, when I have got the ship\r\ncleared for her voyage, with provisions, and so forth, you will be\r\ncontent to restore Captain Goffe to the command, as I said before, and\r\nput me ashore somewhere, to shift for myself--You will then be sure it\r\nis impossible I can betray you, since I will remain with you to the last\r\nmoment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, and after the last moment, too, by the blue vault! or I mistake the\r\nmatter,\" muttered Bunce to himself.\r\n\r\nThe matter was now put to the vote; and so confident were the crew in\r\nCleveland's superior address and management, that the temporary\r\ndeposition of Goffe found little resistance even among his own\r\npartisans, who reasonably enough observed, \"he might at least have kept\r\nsober to look after his own business--E'en let him put it to rights\r\nagain himself next morning, if he will.\"\r\n\r\nBut when the next morning came, the drunken part of the crew, being\r\ninformed of the issue of the deliberations of the council, to which they\r\nwere virtually held to have assented, showed such a superior sense of\r\nCleveland's merits, that Goffe, sulky and malecontent as he was, judged\r\nit wisest for the present to suppress his feelings of resentment, until\r\na safer opportunity for suffering them to explode, and to submit to the\r\ndegradation which so frequently took place among a piratical crew.\r\n\r\nCleveland, on his part, resolved to take upon him, with spirit and\r\nwithout loss of time, the task of extricating his ship's company from\r\ntheir perilous situation. For this purpose, he ordered the boat, with\r\nthe purpose of going ashore in person, carrying with him twelve of the\r\nstoutest and best men of the crew, all very handsomely appointed, (for\r\nthe success of their nefarious profession had enabled the pirates to\r\nassume nearly as gay dresses as their officers,) and above all, each man\r\nbeing sufficiently armed with cutlass and pistols, and several having\r\npole-axes and poniards.\r\n\r\nCleveland himself was gallantly attired in a blue coat, lined with\r\ncrimson silk, and laced with gold very richly, crimson damask waistcoat\r\nand breeches, a velvet cap, richly embroidered, with a white feather,\r\nwhite silk stockings, and red-heeled shoes, which were the extremity of\r\nfinery among the gallants of the day. He had a gold chain several times\r\nfolded round his neck, which sustained a whistle of the same metal, the\r\nensign of his authority. Above all, he wore a decoration peculiar to\r\nthose daring depredators, who, besides one, or perhaps two brace of\r\npistols at their belt, had usually two additional brace, of the finest\r\nmounting and workmanship, suspended over their shoulders in a sort of\r\nsling or scarf of crimson ribbon. The hilt and mounting of the Captain's\r\nsword corresponded in value to the rest of his appointments, and his\r\nnatural good mien was so well adapted to the whole equipment, that,\r\nwhen he appeared on deck, he was received with a general shout by the\r\ncrew, who, as in other popular societies, judged a great deal by the\r\neye.\r\n\r\nCleveland took with him in the boat, amongst others, his predecessor in\r\noffice, Goffe, who was also very richly dressed, but who, not having the\r\nadvantage of such an exterior as Cleveland's, looked like a boorish\r\nclown in the dress of a courtier, or rather like a vulgar-faced footpad\r\ndecked in the spoils of some one whom he has murdered, and whose claim\r\nto the property of his garments is rendered doubtful in the eyes of all\r\nwho look upon him, by the mixture of awkwardness, remorse, cruelty, and\r\ninsolence, which clouds his countenance. Cleveland probably chose to\r\ntake Goffe ashore with him, to prevent his having any opportunity,\r\nduring his absence, to debauch the crew from their allegiance. In this\r\nguise they left the ship, and, singing to their oars, while the water\r\nfoamed higher at the chorus, soon reached the quay of Kirkwall.\r\n\r\nThe command of the vessel was in the meantime intrusted to Bunce, upon\r\nwhose allegiance Cleveland knew that he might perfectly depend, and, in\r\na private conversation with him of some length, he gave him directions\r\nhow to act in such emergencies as might occur.\r\n\r\nThese arrangements being made, and Bunce having been repeatedly charged\r\nto stand upon his guard alike against the adherents of Goffe and any\r\nattempt from the shore, the boat put off. As she approached the harbour,\r\nCleveland displayed a white flag, and could observe that their\r\nappearance seemed to occasion a good deal of bustle and alarm. People\r\nwere seen running to and fro, and some of them appeared to be getting\r\nunder arms. The battery was manned hastily, and the English colours\r\ndisplayed. These were alarming symptoms, the rather that Cleveland knew,\r\nthat, though there were no artillerymen in Kirkwall, yet there were many\r\nsailors perfectly competent to the management of great guns, and willing\r\nenough to undertake such service in case of need.\r\n\r\nNoting these hostile preparations with a heedful eye, but suffering\r\nnothing like doubt or anxiety to appear on his countenance, Cleveland\r\nran the boat right for the quay, on which several people, armed with\r\nmuskets, rifles, and fowlingpieces, and others with half-pikes and\r\nwhaling-knives, were now assembled, as if to oppose his landing.\r\nApparently, however, they had not positively determined what measures\r\nthey were to pursue; for, when the boat reached the quay, those\r\nimmediately opposite bore back, and suffered Cleveland and his party to\r\nleap ashore without hinderance. They immediately drew up on the quay,\r\nexcept two, who, as their Captain had commanded, remained in the boat,\r\nwhich they put off to a little distance; a man[oe]uvre which, while it\r\nplaced the boat (the only one belonging to the sloop) out of danger of\r\nbeing seized, indicated a sort of careless confidence in Cleveland and\r\nhis party, which was calculated to intimidate their opponents.\r\n\r\nThe Kirkwallers, however, showed the old Northern blood, put a manly\r\nface upon the matter, and stood upon the quay, with their arms\r\nshouldered, directly opposite to the rovers, and blocking up against\r\nthem the street which leads to the town.\r\n\r\nCleveland was the first who spoke, as the parties stood thus looking\r\nupon each other.--\"How is this, gentlemen burghers?\" he said; \"are you\r\nOrkney folks turned Highlandmen, that you are all under arms so early\r\nthis morning; or have you manned the quay to give me the honour of a\r\nsalute, upon taking the command of my ship?\"\r\n\r\nThe burghers looked on each other, and one of them replied to\r\nCleveland--\"We do not know who you are; it was that other man,\" pointing\r\nto Goffe, \"who used to come ashore as Captain.\"\r\n\r\n\"That other gentleman is my mate, and commands in my absence,\" said\r\nCleveland;--\"but what is that to the purpose? I wish to speak with your\r\nLord Mayor, or whatever you call him.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Provost is sitting in council with the Magistrates,\" answered the\r\nspokesman.\r\n\r\n\"So much the better,\" replied Cleveland.--\"Where do their Worships\r\nmeet?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the Council-house,\" answered the other.\r\n\r\n\"Then make way for us, gentlemen, if you please, for my people and I are\r\ngoing there.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a whisper among the townspeople; but several were unresolved\r\nupon engaging in a desperate, and perhaps an unnecessary conflict, with\r\ndesperate men; and the more determined citizens formed the hasty\r\nreflection that the strangers might be more easily mastered in the\r\nhouse, or perhaps in the narrow streets which they had to traverse, than\r\nwhen they stood drawn up and prepared for battle upon the quay. They\r\nsuffered them, therefore, to proceed unmolested; and Cleveland, moving\r\nvery slowly, keeping his people close together, suffering no one to\r\npress upon the flanks of his little detachment, and making four men, who\r\nconstituted his rear-guard, turn round and face to the rear from time to\r\ntime, rendered it, by his caution, a very dangerous task to make any\r\nattempt upon them.\r\n\r\nIn this manner they ascended the narrow street and reached the\r\nCouncil-house, where the Magistrates were actually sitting, as the\r\ncitizen had informed Cleveland. Here the inhabitants began to press\r\nforward, with the purpose of mingling with the pirates, and availing\r\nthemselves of the crowd in the narrow entrance, to secure as many as\r\nthey could, without allowing them room for the free use of their\r\nweapons. But this also had Cleveland foreseen, and, ere entering the\r\ncouncil-room, he caused the entrance to be cleared and secured,\r\ncommanding four of his men to face down the street, and as many to\r\nconfront the crowd who were thrusting each other from above. The\r\nburghers recoiled back from the ferocious, swarthy, and sunburnt\r\ncountenances, as well as the levelled arms of these desperadoes, and\r\nCleveland, with the rest of his party, entered the council-room, where\r\nthe Magistrates were sitting in council, with very little attendance.\r\nThese gentlemen were thus separated effectually from the citizens, who\r\nlooked to them for orders, and were perhaps more completely at the mercy\r\nof Cleveland, than he, with his little handful of men, could be said to\r\nbe at that of the multitude by whom they were surrounded.\r\n\r\nThe Magistrates seemed sensible of their danger; for they looked upon\r\neach other in some confusion, when Cleveland thus addressed them:--\r\n\r\n\"Good morrow, gentlemen,--I hope there is no unkindness betwixt us. I am\r\ncome to talk with you about getting supplies for my ship yonder in the\r\nroadstead--we cannot sail without them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your ship, sir?\" said the Provost, who was a man of sense and\r\nspirit,--\"how do we know that you are her Captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look at me,\" said Cleveland, \"and you will, I think, scarce ask the\r\nquestion again.\"\r\n\r\nThe Magistrate looked at Kim, and accordingly did not think proper to\r\npursue that part of the enquiry, but proceeded to say--\"And if you are\r\nher Captain, whence comes she, and where is she bound for? You look too\r\nmuch like a man-of-war's man to be master of a trader, and we know that\r\nyou do not belong to the British navy.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are more men-of-war on the sea than sail under the British flag,\"\r\nreplied Cleveland; \"but say that I were commander of a free-trader here,\r\nwilling to exchange tobacco, brandy, gin, and such like, for cured fish\r\nand hides, why, I do not think I deserve so very bad usage from the\r\nmerchants of Kirkwall as to deny me provisions for my money?\"\r\n\r\n\"Look you, Captain,\" said the Town-clerk, \"it is not that we are so very\r\nstrait-laced neither--for, when gentlemen of your cloth come this way,\r\nit is as weel, as I tauld the Provost, just to do as the collier did\r\nwhen he met the devil,--and that is, to have naething to say to them, if\r\nthey have naething to say to us;--and there is the gentleman,\" pointing\r\nto Goffe, \"that was Captain before you, and may be Captain after\r\nyou,\"--(\"The cuckold speaks truth in that,\" muttered Goffe,)--\"he knows\r\nwell how handsomely we entertained him, till he and his men took upon\r\nthem to run through the town like hellicat devils.--I see one of them\r\nthere!--that was the very fellow that stopped my servant-wench on the\r\nstreet, as she carried the lantern home before me, and insulted her\r\nbefore my face!\"\r\n\r\n\"If it please your noble Mayorship's honour and glory,\" said Derrick,\r\nthe fellow at whom the Town-clerk pointed, \"it was not I that brought\r\nto the bit of a tender that carried the lantern in the poop--it was\r\nquite a different sort of a person.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who was it, then, sir?\" said the Provost.\r\n\r\n\"Why, please your majesty's worship,\" said Derrick, making several sea\r\nbows, and describing as nearly as he could, the exterior of the worthy\r\nMagistrate himself, \"he was an elderly gentleman,--Dutch-built, round in\r\nthe stern, with a white wig and a red nose--very like your majesty, I\r\nthink;\" then, turning to a comrade, he added, \"Jack, don't you think the\r\nfellow that wanted to kiss the pretty girl with the lantern t'other\r\nnight, was very like his worship?\"\r\n\r\n\"By G--, Tom Derrick,\" answered the party appealed to, \"I believe it is\r\nthe very man!\"\r\n\r\n\"This is insolence which we can make you repent of, gentlemen!\" said the\r\nMagistrate, justly irritated at their effrontery; \"you have behaved in\r\nthis town, as if you were in an Indian village at Madagascar. You\r\nyourself, Captain, if captain you be, were at the head of another riot,\r\nno longer since than yesterday. We will give you no provisions till we\r\nknow better whom we are supplying. And do not think to bully us; when I\r\nshake this handkerchief out at the window, which is at my elbow, your\r\nship goes to the bottom. Remember she lies under the guns of our\r\nbattery.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how many of these guns are honeycombed, Mr. Mayor?\" said Cleveland.\r\nHe put the question by chance; but instantly perceived, from a sort of\r\nconfusion which the Provost in vain endeavoured to hide, that the\r\nartillery of Kirkwall was not in the best order. \"Come, come, Mr.\r\nMayor,\" he said, \"bullying will go down with us as little as with you.\r\nYour guns yonder will do more harm to the poor old sailors who are to\r\nwork them than to our sloop; and if we bring a broadside to bear on the\r\ntown, why, your wives' crockery will be in some danger. And then to talk\r\nto us of seamen being a little frolicsome ashore, why, when are they\r\notherwise? You have the Greenland whalers playing the devil among you\r\nevery now and then; and the very Dutchmen cut capers in the streets of\r\nKirkwall, like porpoises before a gale of wind. I am told you are a man\r\nof sense, and I am sure you and I could settle this matter in the course\r\nof a five-minutes' palaver.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir,\" said the Provost, \"I will hear what you have to say, if you\r\nwill walk this way.\"\r\n\r\nCleveland accordingly followed him into a small interior apartment, and,\r\nwhen there, addressed the Provost thus: \"I will lay aside my pistols,\r\nsir, if you are afraid of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"D----n your pistols!\" answered the Provost, \"I have served the King,\r\nand fear the smell of powder as little as you do!\"\r\n\r\n\"So much the better,\" said Cleveland, \"for you will hear me the more\r\ncoolly.--Now, sir, let us be what perhaps you suspect us, or let us be\r\nany thing else, what, in the name of Heaven, can you get by keeping us\r\nhere, but blows and bloodshed? For which, believe me, we are much better\r\nprovided than you can pretend to be. The point is a plain one--you are\r\ndesirous to be rid of us--we are desirous to be gone. Let us have the\r\nmeans of departure, and we leave you instantly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Look ye, Captain,\" said the Provost, \"I thirst for no man's blood. You\r\nare a pretty fellow, as there were many among the buccaniers in my\r\ntime--but there is no harm in wishing you a better trade. You should\r\nhave the stores and welcome, for your money, so you would make these\r\nseas clear of you. But then, here lies the rub. The Halcyon frigate is\r\nexpected here in these parts immediately; when she hears of you she will\r\nbe at you; for there is nothing the white lapelle loves better than a\r\nrover--you are seldom without a cargo of dollars. Well, he comes down,\r\ngets you under his stern\"----\r\n\r\n\"Blows us into the air, if you please,\" said Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, that must be as _you_ please, Captain,\" said the Provost; \"but\r\nthen, what is to come of the good town of Kirkwall, that has been\r\npacking and peeling with the King's enemies? The burgh will be laid\r\nunder a round fine, and it may be that the Provost may not come off so\r\neasily.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then,\" said Cleveland, \"I see where your pinch lies. Now, suppose\r\nthat I run round this island of yours, and get into the roadstead at\r\nStromness? We could get what we want put on board there, without\r\nKirkwall or the Provost seeming to have any hand in it; or, if it should\r\nbe ever questioned, your want of force, and our superior strength, will\r\nmake a sufficient apology.\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be,\" said the Provost; \"but if I suffer you to leave your\r\npresent station, and go elsewhere, I must have some security that you\r\nwill not do harm to the country.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we,\" said Cleveland, \"must have some security on our side, that you\r\nwill not detain us, by dribbling out our time till the Halcyon is on the\r\ncoast. Now, I am myself perfectly willing to continue on shore as a\r\nhostage, on the one side, provided you will give me your word not to\r\nbetray me, and send some magistrate, or person of consequence, aboard\r\nthe sloop, where his safety will be a guarantee for mine.\"\r\n\r\nThe Provost shook his head, and intimated it would be difficult to find\r\na person willing to place himself as hostage in such a perilous\r\ncondition; but said he would propose the arrangement to such of the\r\ncouncil as were fit to be trusted with a matter of such weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[35] This was really an exploit of the celebrated Avery the pirate, who\r\nsuddenly, and without provocation, fired his pistols under the table\r\nwhere he sat drinking with his messmates, wounded one man severely, and\r\nthought the matter a good jest. What is still more extraordinary, his\r\ncrew regarded it in the same light.\r\n\r\n[36] A ship going fast through the sea is said to cut a feather,\r\nalluding to the ripple which she throws off from her bows.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n  \"I left my poor plough to go ploughing the deep!\"\r\n\r\n                                                     DIBDIN.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Provost and Cleveland had returned into the public\r\ncouncil-room, the former retired a second time with such of his brethren\r\nas he thought proper to advise with; and, while they were engaged in\r\ndiscussing Cleveland's proposal, refreshments were offered to him and\r\nhis party. These the Captain permitted his people to partake of, but\r\nwith the greatest precaution against surprisal, one party relieving the\r\nguard, whilst the others were at their food.\r\n\r\nHe himself, in the meanwhile, walked up and down the apartment, and\r\nconversed upon indifferent subjects with those present, like a person\r\nquite at his ease.\r\n\r\nAmongst these individuals he saw, somewhat to his surprise, Triptolemus\r\nYellowley, who, chancing to be at Kirkwall, had been summoned by the\r\nMagistrates, as representative, in a certain degree, of the Lord\r\nChamberlain, to attend council on this occasion. Cleveland immediately\r\nrenewed the acquaintance which he had formed with the agriculturist at\r\nBurgh-Westra, and asked him his present business in Orkney.\r\n\r\n\"Just to look after some of my little plans, Captain Cleveland. I am\r\nweary of fighting with wild beasts at Ephesus yonder, and I just cam\r\nower to see how my orchard was thriving, whilk I had planted four or\r\nfive miles from Kirkwall, it may be a year bygane, and how the bees were\r\nthriving, whereof I had imported nine skeps, for the improvement of the\r\ncountry, and for the turning of the heather-bloom into wax and honey.\"\r\n\r\n\"And they thrive, I hope?\" said Cleveland, who, however little\r\ninterested in the matter, sustained the conversation, as if to break the\r\nchilly and embarrassed silence which hung upon the company assembled.\r\n\r\n\"Thrive!\" replied Triptolemus; \"they thrive like every thing else in\r\nthis country, and that is the backward way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Want of care, I suppose?\" said Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\"The contrary, sir, quite and clean the contrary,\" replied the Factor;\r\n\"they died of ower muckle care, like Lucky Christie's chickens.--I asked\r\nto see the skeps, and cunning and joyful did the fallow look who was to\r\nhave taken care of them--'Had there been ony body in charge but mysell,'\r\nhe said, 'ye might have seen the skeps, or whatever you ca' them; but\r\nthere wad hae been as mony solan-geese as flees in them, if it hadna\r\nbeen for my four quarters; for I watched them so closely, that I saw\r\nthem a' creeping out at the little holes one sunny morning, and if I had\r\nnot stopped the leak on the instant with a bit clay, the deil a bee, or\r\nflee, or whatever they are, would have been left in the skeps, as ye ca'\r\nthem!'--In a word, sir, he had clagged up the hives, as if the puir\r\nthings had had the pestilence, and my bees were as dead as if they had\r\nbeen smeaked--and so ends my hope, _generandi gloria mellis_, as\r\nVirgilius hath it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There is an end of your mead, then,\" replied Cleveland; \"but what is\r\nyour chance of cider?--How does the orchard thrive?\"\r\n\r\n\"O Captain! this same Solomon of the Orcadian Ophir--I am sure no man\r\nneed to send thither to fetch either talents of gold or talents of\r\nsense!--I say, this wise man had watered the young apple-trees, in his\r\ngreat tenderness, with hot water, and they are perished, root and\r\nbranch! But what avails grieving?--And I wish you would tell me,\r\ninstead, what is all the din that these good folks are making about\r\npirates? and what for all these ill-looking men, that are armed like so\r\nmony Highlandmen, assembled in the judgment-chamber?--for I am just come\r\nfrom the other side of the island, and I have heard nothing distinct\r\nabout it.--And, now I look at you yoursell, Captain, I think you have\r\nmair of these foolish pistolets about you than should suffice an honest\r\nman in quiet times?\"\r\n\r\n\"And so I think, too,\" said the pacific Triton, old Haagen, who had been\r\nan unwilling follower of the daring Montrose; \"if you had been in the\r\nGlen of Edderachyllis, when we were sae sair worried by Sir John\r\nWorry\"----\r\n\r\n\"You have forgot the whole matter, neighbour Haagen,\" said the Factor;\r\n\"Sir John Urry was on your side, and was ta'en with Montrose; by the\r\nsame token, he lost his head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he?\" said the Triton.--\"I believe you may be right; for he changed\r\nsides mair than anes, and wha kens whilk he died for?--But always he was\r\nthere, and so was I;--a fight there was, and I never wish to see\r\nanother!\"\r\n\r\nThe entrance of the Provost here interrupted their desultory\r\nconversation.--\"We have determined,\" he said, \"Captain, that your ship\r\nshall go round to Stromness, or Scalpa-flow, to take in stores, in order\r\nthat there may be no more quarrels between the Fair folks and your\r\nseamen. And as you wish to stay on shore to see the Fair, we intend to\r\nsend a respectable gentleman on board your vessel to pilot her round the\r\nMainland, as the navigation is but ticklish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spoken like a quiet and sensible magistrate, Mr. Mayor,\" said\r\nCleveland, \"and no otherwise than as I expected.--And what gentleman is\r\nto honour our quarter-deck during my absence?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have fixed that, too, Captain Cleveland,\" said the Provost; \"you may\r\nbe sure we were each more desirous than another to go upon so pleasant a\r\nvoyage, and in such good company; but being Fair time, most of us have\r\nsome affairs in hand--I myself, in respect of my office, cannot be well\r\nspared--the eldest Bailie's wife is lying-in--the Treasurer does not\r\nagree with the sea--two Bailies have the gout--the other two are absent\r\nfrom town--and the other fifteen members of council are all engaged on\r\nparticular business.\"\r\n\r\n\"All that I can tell you, Mr. Mayor,\" said Cleveland, raising his voice,\r\n\"is, that I expect\"----\r\n\r\n\"A moment's patience, if you please, Captain,\" said the Provost,\r\ninterrupting him--\"So that we have come to the resolution that our\r\nworthy Mr. Triptolemus Yellowley, who is Factor to the Lord Chamberlain\r\nof these islands, shall, in respect of his official situation, be\r\npreferred to the honour and pleasure of accompanying you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Me!\" said the astonished Triptolemus; \"what the devil should I do going\r\non your voyages?--my business is on dry land!\"\r\n\r\n\"The gentlemen want a pilot,\" said the Provost, whispering to him, \"and\r\nthere is no eviting to give them one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do they want to go bump on shore, then?\" said the Factor--\"how the\r\ndevil should I pilot them, that never touched rudder in my life?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush!--hush!--be silent!\" said the Provost; \"if the people of this town\r\nheard ye say such a word, your utility, and respect, and rank, and every\r\nthing else, is clean gone!--No man is any thing with us island folks,\r\nunless he can hand, reef, and steer.--Besides, it is but a mere form;\r\nand we will send old Pate Sinclair to help you. You will have nothing to\r\ndo but to eat, drink, and be merry all day.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eat and drink!\" said the Factor, not able to comprehend exactly why\r\nthis piece of duty was pressed upon him so hastily, and yet not very\r\ncapable of resisting or extricating himself from the toils of the more\r\nknowing Provost--\"Eat and drink?--that is all very well; but, to speak\r\ntruth, the sea does not agree with me any more than with the Treasurer;\r\nand I have always a better appetite for eating and drinking ashore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hush! hush! hush!\" again said the Provost, in an under tone of earnest\r\nexpostulation; \"would you actually ruin your character out and out?--A\r\nFactor of the High Chamberlain of the Isles of Orkney and Zetland, and\r\nnot like the sea!--you might as well say you are a Highlander, and do\r\nnot like whisky!\"\r\n\r\n\"You must settle it somehow, gentlemen,\" said Captain Cleveland; \"it is\r\ntime we were under weigh.--Mr. Triptolemus Yellowley, are we to be\r\nhonoured with your company?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure, Captain Cleveland,\" stammered the Factor, \"I would have no\r\nobjection to go anywhere with you--only\"----\r\n\r\n\"He has no objection,\" said the Provost, catching at the first limb of\r\nthe sentence, without awaiting the conclusion.\r\n\r\n\"He has no objection,\" cried the Treasurer.\r\n\r\n\"He has no objection,\" sung out the whole four Bailies together;\r\nand the fifteen Councillors, all catching up the same phrase of\r\nassent, repeated it in chorus, with the additions of--\"good\r\nman\"--\"public-spirited\"--\"honourable gentleman\"--\"burgh eternally\r\nobliged\"--\"where will you find such a worthy Factor?\" and so forth.\r\n\r\nAstonished and confused at the praises with which he was overwhelmed on\r\nall sides, and in no shape understanding the nature of the transaction\r\nthat was going forward, the astounded and overwhelmed agriculturist\r\nbecame incapable of resisting the part of the Kirkwall Curtius thus\r\ninsidiously forced upon him, and was delivered up by Captain Cleveland\r\nto his party, with the strictest injunctions to treat him with honour\r\nand attention. Goffe and his companions began now to lead him off, amid\r\nthe applauses of the whole meeting, after the manner in which the victim\r\nof ancient days was garlanded and greeted by shouts, when consigned to\r\nthe priests, for the purpose of being led to the altar, and knocked on\r\nthe head, a sacrifice for the commonweal. It was while they thus\r\nconducted, and in a manner forced him out of the Council-chamber, that\r\npoor Triptolemus, much alarmed at finding that Cleveland, in whom he had\r\nsome confidence, was to remain behind the party, tried, when just going\r\nout at the door, the effect of one remonstrating bellow.--\"Nay, but,\r\nProvost!--Captain!--Bailies!--Treasurer! Councillors!--if Captain\r\nCleveland does not go aboard to protect me, it is nae bargain, and go I\r\nwill not, unless I am trailed with cart-ropes!\"\r\n\r\nHis protest was, however, drowned in the unanimous chorus of the\r\nMagistrates and Councillors, returning him thanks for his public\r\nspirit--wishing him a good voyage--and praying to Heaven for his happy\r\nand speedy return. Stunned and overwhelmed, and thinking, if he had any\r\ndistinct thoughts at all, that remonstrance was vain, where friends and\r\nstrangers seemed alike determined to carry the point against him,\r\nTriptolemus, without farther resistance, suffered himself to be\r\nconducted into the street, where the pirate's boat's-crew, assembling\r\naround him, began to move slowly towards the quay, many of the townsfolk\r\nfollowing out of curiosity, but without any attempt at interference or\r\nannoyance; for the pacific compromise which the dexterity of the first\r\nMagistrate had achieved, was unanimously approved of as a much better\r\nsettlement of the disputes betwixt them and the strangers, than might\r\nhave been attained by the dubious issue of an appeal to arms.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, as they went slowly along, Triptolemus had time to study the\r\nappearance, countenance, and dress, of those into whose hands he had\r\nbeen thus delivered, and began to imagine that he read in their looks,\r\nnot only the general expression of a desperate character, but some\r\nsinister intentions directed particularly towards himself. He was\r\nalarmed by the truculent looks of Goffe, in particular, who, holding his\r\narm with a gripe which resembled in delicacy of touch the compression of\r\na smith's vice, cast on him from the outer corner of his eye oblique\r\nglances, like those which the eagle throws upon the prey which she has\r\nclutched, ere yet she proceeds, as it is technically called, to plume\r\nit. At length Yellowley's fears got so far the better of his prudence,\r\nthat he fairly asked his terrible conductor, in a sort of crying\r\nwhisper, \"Are you going to murder me, Captain, in the face of the laws\r\nbaith of God and man?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold your peace, if you are wise,\" said Goffe, who had his own reasons\r\nfor desiring to increase the panic of his captive; \"we have not murdered\r\na man these three months, and why should you put us in mind of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are but joking, I hope, good worthy Captain!\" replied Triptolemus.\r\n\"This is worse than witches, dwarfs, dirking of whales, and cowping of\r\ncobles, put all together!--this is an away-ganging crop, with a\r\nvengeance!--What good, in Heaven's name, would murdering me do to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"We might have some pleasure in it, at least,\" said Goffe.--\"Look these\r\nfellows in the face, and see if you see one among them that would not\r\nrather kill a man than let it alone?--But we will speak more of that\r\nwhen you have first had a taste of the bilboes--unless, indeed, you come\r\ndown with a handsome round handful of Chili boards[37] for your ransom.\"\r\n\r\n\"As I shall live by bread, Captain,\" answered the Factor, \"that\r\nmisbegotten dwarf has carried off the whole hornful of silver!\"\r\n\r\n\"A cat-and-nine-tails will make you find it again,\" said Goffe, gruffly;\r\n\"flogging and pickling is an excellent receipt to bring a man's wealth\r\ninto his mind--twisting a bowstring round his skull till the eyes start\r\na little, is a very good remembrancer too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain,\" replied Yellowley, stoutly, \"I have no money--seldom can\r\nimprovers have. We turn pasture to tillage, and barley into aits, and\r\nheather into greensward, and the poor _yarpha_, as the benighted\r\ncreatures here call their peat-bogs, into baittle grass-land; but we\r\nseldom make any thing of it that comes back to our ain pouch. The carles\r\nand the cart-avers make it all, and the carles and the cart-avers eat it\r\nall, and the deil clink doun with it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" said Goffe, \"if you be really a poor fellow, as you\r\npretend, I'll stand your friend;\" then, inclining his head so as to\r\nreach the ear of the Factor, who stood on tiptoe with anxiety, he said,\r\n\"If you love your life, do not enter the boat with us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how am I to get away from you, while you hold me so fast by the\r\narm, that I could not get off if the whole year's crop of Scotland\r\ndepended on it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hark ye, you gudgeon,\" said Goffe, \"just when you come to the water's\r\nedge, and when the fellows are jumping in and taking their oars, slue\r\nyourself round suddenly to the larboard--I will let go your arm--and\r\nthen cut and run for your life!\"\r\n\r\nTriptolemus did as he was desired, Goffe's willing hand relaxed the\r\ngrasp as he had promised, the agriculturist trundled off like a football\r\nthat has just received a strong impulse from the foot of one of the\r\nplayers, and, with celerity which surprised himself as well as all\r\nbeholders, fled through the town of Kirkwall. Nay, such was the impetus\r\nof his retreat, that, as if the grasp of the pirate was still open to\r\npounce upon him, he never stopped till he had traversed the whole town,\r\nand attained the open country on the other side. They who had seen him\r\nthat day--his hat and wig lost in the sudden effort he had made to bolt\r\nforward, his cravat awry, and his waistcoat unbuttoned,--and who had an\r\nopportunity of comparing his round spherical form and short legs with\r\nthe portentous speed at which he scoured through the street, might well\r\nsay, that if Fury ministers arms, Fear confers wings. His very mode of\r\nrunning seemed to be that peculiar to his fleecy care, for, like a ram\r\nin the midst of his race, he ever and anon encouraged himself by a great\r\nbouncing attempt at a leap, though there were no obstacles in his way.\r\n\r\nThere was no pursuit after the agriculturist; and though a musket or two\r\nwere presented, for the purpose of sending a leaden messenger after him,\r\nyet Goffe, turning peace-maker for once in his life, so exaggerated the\r\ndangers that would attend a breach of the truce with the people of\r\nKirkwall, that he prevailed upon the boat's crew to forbear any active\r\nhostilities, and to pull off for their vessel with all dispatch.\r\n\r\nThe burghers, who regarded the escape of Triptolemus as a triumph on\r\ntheir side, gave the boat three cheers, by way of an insulting farewell;\r\nwhile the Magistrates, on the other hand, entertained great anxiety\r\nrespecting the probable consequences of this breach of articles between\r\nthem and the pirates; and, could they have seized upon the fugitive very\r\nprivately, instead of complimenting him with a civic feast in honour of\r\nthe agility which he displayed, it is likely they might have delivered\r\nthe runaway hostage once more into the hands of his foemen. But it was\r\nimpossible to set their face publicly to such an act of violence, and\r\ntherefore they contented themselves with closely watching Cleveland,\r\nwhom they determined to make responsible for any aggression which might\r\nbe attempted by the pirates. Cleveland, on his part, easily conjectured\r\nthat the motive which Goffe had for suffering the hostage to escape, was\r\nto leave him answerable for all consequences, and, relying more on the\r\nattachment and intelligence of his friend and adherent, Frederick\r\nAltamont, alias Jack Bunce, than on any thing else, expected the result\r\nwith considerable anxiety, since the Magistrates, though they continued\r\nto treat him with civility, plainly intimated they would regulate his\r\ntreatment by the behaviour of the crew, though he no longer commanded\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, without some reason that he reckoned on the devoted\r\nfidelity of Bunce; for no sooner did that trusty adherent receive from\r\nGoffe, and the boat's crew, the news of the escape of Triptolemus, than\r\nhe immediately concluded it had been favoured by the late Captain, in\r\norder that, Cleveland being either put to death or consigned to hopeless\r\nimprisonment, Goffe might be called upon to resume the command of the\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\n\"But the drunken old boatswain shall miss his mark,\" said Bunce to his\r\nconfederate Fletcher; \"or else I am contented to quit the name of\r\nAltamont, and be called Jack Bunce, or Jack Dunce, if you like it\r\nbetter, to the end of the chapter.\"\r\n\r\nAvailing himself accordingly of a sort of nautical eloquence, which his\r\nenemies termed slack-jaw, Bunce set before the crew, in a most animated\r\nmanner, the disgrace which they all sustained, by their Captain\r\nremaining, as he was pleased to term it, in the bilboes, without any\r\nhostage to answer for his safety; and succeeded so far, that, besides\r\nexciting a good deal of discontent against Goffe, he brought the crew to\r\nthe resolution of seizing the first vessel of a tolerable appearance,\r\nand declaring that the ship, crew, and cargo, should be dealt with\r\naccording to the usage which Cleveland should receive on shore. It was\r\njudged at the same time proper to try the faith of the Orcadians, by\r\nremoving from the roadstead of Kirkwall, and going round to that of\r\nStromness, where, according to the treaty betwixt Provost Torfe and\r\nCaptain Cleveland, they were to victual their sloop. They resolved, in\r\nthe meantime, to intrust the command of the vessel to a council,\r\nconsisting of Goffe, the boatswain, and Bunce himself, until Cleveland\r\nshould be in a situation to resume his command.\r\n\r\nThese resolutions having been proposed and acceded to, they weighed\r\nanchor, and got their sloop under sail, without experiencing any\r\nopposition or annoyance from the battery, which relieved them of one\r\nimportant apprehension incidental to their situation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[37] Commonly called by landsmen, Spanish dollars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n  Clap on more sail, pursue, up with your fights,\r\n  Give fire--she is my prize, or ocean whelm them all!\r\n\r\n                                                 SHAKSPEARE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA very handsome brig, which, with several other vessels, was the\r\nproperty of Magnus Troil, the great Zetland Udaller, had received on\r\nboard that Magnate himself, his two lovely daughters, and the facetious\r\nClaud Halcro, who, for friendship's sake chiefly, and the love of beauty\r\nproper to his poetical calling, attended them on their journey from\r\nZetland to the capital of Orkney, to which Norna had referred them, as\r\nthe place where her mystical oracles should at length receive a\r\nsatisfactory explanation.\r\n\r\nThey passed, at a distance, the tremendous cliffs of the lonely spot of\r\nearth called the Fair Isle, which, at an equal distance from either\r\narchipelago, lies in the sea which divides Orkney from Zetland; and at\r\nlength, after some baffling winds, made the Start of Sanda. Off the\r\nheadland so named, they became involved in a strong current, well known,\r\nby those who frequent these seas, as the Roost of the Start, which\r\ncarried them considerably out of their course, and, joined to an adverse\r\nwind, forced them to keep on the east side of the island of Stronsa,\r\nand, finally compelled them to lie by for the night in Papa Sound, since\r\nthe navigation in dark or thick weather, amongst so many low islands, is\r\nneither pleasant nor safe.\r\n\r\nOn the ensuing morning they resumed their voyage under more favourable\r\nauspices; and, coasting along the island of Stronsa, whose flat,\r\nverdant, and comparatively fertile shores, formed a strong contrast to\r\nthe dun hills and dark cliffs of their own islands, they doubled the\r\ncape called the Lambhead, and stood away for Kirkwall.\r\n\r\nThey had scarce opened the beautiful bay betwixt Pomona and Shapinsha,\r\nand the sisters were admiring the massive church of Saint Magnus, as it\r\nwas first seen to rise from amongst the inferior buildings of Kirkwall,\r\nwhen the eyes of Magnus, and of Claud Halcro, were attracted by an\r\nobject which they thought more interesting. This was an armed sloop,\r\nwith her sails set, which had just left the anchorage in the bay, and\r\nwas running before the wind by which the brig of the Udaller was beating\r\nin.\r\n\r\n\"A tight thing that, by my ancestors' bones!\" said the old Udaller; \"but\r\nI cannot make out of what country, as she shows no colours. Spanish\r\nbuilt, I should think her.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, ay,\" said Claud Halcro, \"she has all the look of it. She runs\r\nbefore the wind that we must battle with, which is the wonted way of the\r\nworld. As glorious John says,--\r\n\r\n  'With roomy deck, and guns of mighty strength\r\n    Whose low-laid mouths each mounting billow laves,\r\n  Deep in her draught, and warlike in her length,\r\n    She seems a sea-wasp flying on the waves.'\"\r\n\r\nBrenda could not help telling Halcro, when he had spouted this stanza\r\nwith great enthusiasm, \"that though the description was more like a\r\nfirst-rate than a sloop, yet the simile of the sea-wasp served but\r\nindifferently for either.\"\r\n\r\n\"A sea-wasp?\" said Magnus, looking with some surprise, as the sloop,\r\nshifting her course, suddenly bore down on them: \"Egad, I wish she may\r\nnot show us presently that she has a sting!\"\r\n\r\nWhat the Udaller said in jest, was fulfilled in earnest; for, without\r\nhoisting colours, or hailing, two shots were discharged from the sloop,\r\none of which ran dipping and dancing upon the water, just ahead of the\r\nZetlander's bows, while the other went through his main-sail.\r\n\r\nMagnus caught up a speaking-trumpet, and hailed the sloop, to demand\r\nwhat she was, and what was the meaning of this unprovoked aggression. He\r\nwas only answered by the stern command,--\"Down top-sails instantly, and\r\nlay your main-sail to the mast--you shall see who we are presently.\"\r\n\r\nThere were no means within the reach of possibility by which obedience\r\ncould be evaded, where it would instantly have been enforced by a\r\nbroadside; and, with much fear on the part of the sisters and Claud\r\nHalcro, mixed with anger and astonishment on that of the Udaller, the\r\nbrig lay-to to await the commands of the captors.\r\n\r\nThe sloop immediately lowered a boat, with six armed hands, commanded by\r\nJack Bunce, which rowed directly for their prize. As they approached\r\nher, Claud Halcro whispered to the Udaller,--\"If what we hear of\r\nbuccaniers be true, these men, with their silk scarfs and vests, have\r\nthe very cut of them.\"\r\n\r\n\"My daughters! my daughters!\" muttered Magnus to himself, with such an\r\nagony as only a father could feel,--\"Go down below, and hide yourselves,\r\ngirls, while I\"----\r\n\r\nHe threw down his speaking-trumpet, and seized on a handspike, while his\r\ndaughters, more afraid of the consequences of his fiery temper to\r\nhimself than of any thing else, hung round him, and begged him to make\r\nno resistance. Claud Halcro united his entreaties, adding, \"It were best\r\npacify the fellows with fair words. They might,\" he said, \"be\r\nDunkirkers, or insolent man-of-war's men on a frolic.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" answered Magnus, \"it is the sloop which the Jagger told us of.\r\nBut I will take your advice--I will have patience for these girls'\r\nsakes; yet\"----\r\n\r\nHe had no time to conclude the sentence, for Bunce jumped on board with\r\nhis party, and drawing his cutlass, struck it upon the companion-ladder,\r\nand declared the ship was theirs.\r\n\r\n\"By what warrant or authority do you stop us on the high seas?\" said\r\nMagnus.\r\n\r\n\"Here are half a dozen of warrants,\" said Bunce, showing the pistols\r\nwhich were hung round him, according to a pirate-fashion already\r\nmentioned, \"choose which you like, old gentleman, and you shall have the\r\nperusal of it presently.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is to say, you intend to rob us?\" said Magnus.--\"So be it--we have\r\nno means to help it--only be civil to the women, and take what you\r\nplease from the vessel. There is not much, but I will and can make it\r\nworth more, if you use us well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Civil to the women!\" said Fletcher, who had also come on board with the\r\ngang--\"when were we else than civil to them? ay, and kind to boot?--Look\r\nhere, Jack Bunce!--what a trim-going little thing here is!--By G--, she\r\nshall make a cruize with us, come of old Squaretoes what will!\"\r\n\r\nHe seized upon the terrified Brenda with one hand, and insolently\r\npulled back with the other the hood of the mantle in which she had\r\nmuffled herself.\r\n\r\n\"Help, father!--help, Minna!\" exclaimed the affrighted girl;\r\nunconscious, at the moment, that they were unable to render her\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nMagnus again uplifted the handspike, but Bunce stopped his\r\nhand.--\"Avast, father!\" he said, \"or you will make a bad voyage of it\r\npresently--And you, Fletcher, let go the girl!\"\r\n\r\n\"And, d----n me! why should I let her go?\" said Fletcher.\r\n\r\n\"Because I command you, Dick,\" said the other, \"and because I'll make it\r\na quarrel else.--And now let me know, beauties, is there one of you\r\nbears that queer heathen name of Minna, for which I have a certain sort\r\nof regard?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gallant sir!\" said Halcro, \"unquestionably it is because you have some\r\npoetry in your heart.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have had enough of it in my mouth in my time,\" answered Bunce; \"but\r\nthat day is by, old gentleman--however, I shall soon find out which of\r\nthese girls is Minna.--Throw back your mufflings from your faces, and\r\ndon't be afraid, my Lindamiras; no one here shall meddle with you to do\r\nyou wrong. On my soul, two pretty wenches!--I wish I were at sea in an\r\negg-shell, and a rock under my lee-bow, if I would wish a better\r\nleaguer-lass than the worst of them!--Hark you, my girls; which of you\r\nwould like to swing in a rover's hammock?--you should have gold for the\r\ngathering!\"\r\n\r\nThe terrified maidens clung close together, and grew pale at the bold\r\nand familiar language of the desperate libertine.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, don't be frightened,\" said he; \"no one shall serve under the\r\nnoble Altamont but by her own free choice--there is no pressing amongst\r\ngentlemen of fortune. And do not look so shy upon me neither, as if I\r\nspoke of what you never thought of before. One of you, at least, has\r\nheard of Captain Cleveland, the Rover.\"\r\n\r\nBrenda grew still paler, but the blood mounted at once in Minna's\r\ncheeks, on hearing the name of her lover thus unexpectedly introduced;\r\nfor the scene was in itself so confounding, that the idea of the\r\nvessel's being the consort of which Cleveland had spoken at\r\nBurgh-Westra, had occurred to no one save the Udaller.\r\n\r\n\"I see how it is,\" said Bunce, with a familiar nod, \"and I will hold my\r\ncourse accordingly.--You need not be afraid of any injury, father,\" he\r\nadded, addressing Magnus familiarly; \"and though I have made many a\r\npretty girl pay tribute in my time, yet yours shall go ashore without\r\neither wrong or ransom.\"\r\n\r\n\"If you will assure me of that,\" said Magnus; \"you are as welcome to the\r\nbrig and cargo, as ever I made man welcome to a can of punch.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it is no bad thing that same can of punch,\" said Bunce, \"if we had\r\nany one here that could mix it well.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do it,\" said Claud Halcro, \"with any man that ever squeezed\r\nlemon--Eric Scambester, the punch-maker of Burgh-Westra, being alone\r\nexcepted.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you are within a grapnel's length of him, too,\" said the\r\nUdaller.--\"Go down below, my girls,\" he added, \"and send up the rare old\r\nman, and the punch-bowl.\"\r\n\r\n\"The punch-bowl!\" said Fletcher; \"I say, the bucket, d----n me!--Talk\r\nof bowls in the cabin of a paltry merchantman, but not to\r\ngentlemen-strollers--rovers, I would say,\" correcting himself, as he\r\nobserved that Bunce looked sour at the mistake.\r\n\r\n\"And I say, these two pretty girls shall stay on deck, and fill my can,\"\r\nsaid Bunce; \"I deserve some attendance, at least, for all my\r\ngenerosity.\"\r\n\r\n\"And they shall fill mine, too,\" said Fletcher--\"they shall fill it to\r\nthe brim!--and I will have a kiss for every drop they spill--broil me if\r\nI won't!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then, I tell you, you shan't!\" said Bunce; \"for I'll be d----d if\r\nany one shall kiss Minna but one, and that's neither you nor I; and her\r\nother little bit of a consort shall 'scape for company;--there are\r\nplenty of willing wenches in Orkney.--And so, now I think on it, these\r\ngirls shall go down below, and bolt themselves into the cabin; and we\r\nshall have the punch up here on deck, _al fresco_, as the old gentleman\r\nproposes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, Jack, I wish you knew your own mind,\" said Fletcher; \"I have been\r\nyour messmate these two years, and I love you; and yet flay me like a\r\nwild bullock, if you have not as many humours as a monkey!--And what\r\nshall we have to make a little fun of, since you have sent the girls\r\ndown below?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, we will have Master Punch-maker here,\" answered Bunce, \"to give us\r\ntoasts, and sing us songs.--And, in the meantime, you there, stand by\r\nsheets and tacks, and get her under way!--and you, steersman, as you\r\nwould keep your brains in your skull, keep her under the stern of the\r\nsloop.--If you attempt to play us any trick, I will scuttle your sconce\r\nas if it were an old calabash!\"\r\n\r\nThe vessel was accordingly got under way, and moved slowly on in the\r\nwake of the sloop, which, as had been previously agreed upon, held her\r\ncourse, not to return to the Bay of Kirkwall, but for an excellent\r\nroadstead called Inganess Bay, formed by a promontory which extends to\r\nthe eastward two or three miles from the Orcadian metropolis, and where\r\nthe vessels might conveniently lie at anchor, while the rovers\r\nmaintained any communication with the Magistrates which the new state of\r\nthings seemed to require.\r\n\r\nMeantime Claud Halcro had exerted his utmost talents in compounding a\r\nbucketful of punch for the use of the pirates, which they drank out of\r\nlarge cans; the ordinary seamen, as well as Bunce and Fletcher, who\r\nacted as officers, dipping them into the bucket with very little\r\nceremony, as they came and went upon their duty. Magnus, who was\r\nparticularly apprehensive that liquor might awaken the brutal passions\r\nof these desperadoes, was yet so much astonished at the quantities which\r\nhe saw them drink, without producing any visible effect upon their\r\nreason, that he could not help expressing his surprise to Bunce himself,\r\nwho, wild as he was, yet appeared by far the most civil and conversable\r\nof his party, and whom he was, perhaps, desirous to conciliate, by a\r\ncompliment of which all boon topers know the value.\r\n\r\n\"Bones of Saint Magnus!\" said the Udaller, \"I used to think I took off\r\nmy can like a gentleman; but to see your men swallow, Captain, one would\r\nthink their stomachs were as bottomless as the hole of Laifell in Foula,\r\nwhich I have sounded myself with a line of an hundred fathoms. By my\r\nsoul, the Bicker of Saint Magnus were but a sip to them!\"\r\n\r\n\"In our way of life, sir,\" answered Bunce, \"there is no stint till duty\r\ncalls, or the puncheon is drunk out.\"\r\n\r\n\"By my word, sir,\" said Claud Halcro, \"I believe there is not one of\r\nyour people but could drink out the mickle bicker of Scarpa, which was\r\nalways offered to the Bishop of Orkney brimful of the best bummock that\r\never was brewed.\"[38]\r\n\r\n\"If drinking could make them bishops,\" said Bunce, \"I should have a\r\nreverend crew of them; but as they have no other clerical qualities\r\nabout them, I do not propose that they shall get drunk to-day; so we\r\nwill cut our drink with a song.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I'll sing it, by ----!\" said or swore Dick Fletcher, and instantly\r\nstruck up the old ditty--\r\n\r\n  \"It was a ship, and a ship of fame,\r\n  Launch'd off the stocks, bound for the main,\r\n  With an hundred and fifty brisk young men,\r\n  All pick'd and chosen every one.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would sooner be keel-hauled than hear that song over again,\" said\r\nBunce; \"and confound your lantern jaws, you can squeeze nothing else out\r\nof them!\"\r\n\r\n\"By ----,\" said Fletcher, \"I will sing my song, whether you like it or\r\nno;\" and again he sung, with the doleful tone of a north-easter\r\nwhistling through sheet and shrouds,--\r\n\r\n  \"Captain Glen was our captain's name;\r\n  A very gallant and brisk young man;\r\n  As bold a sailor as e'er went to sea,\r\n  And we were bound for High Barbary.\"\r\n\r\n\"I tell you again,\" said Bunce, \"we will have none of your screech-owl\r\nmusic here; and I'll be d----d if you shall sit here and make that\r\ninfernal noise!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then, I'll tell you what,\" said Fletcher, getting up, \"I'll sing\r\nwhen I walk about, and I hope there is no harm in that, Jack Bunce.\" And\r\nso, getting up from his seat, he began to walk up and down the sloop,\r\ncroaking out his long and disastrous ballad.\r\n\r\n\"You see how I manage them,\" said Bunce, with a smile of\r\nself-applause--\"allow that fellow two strides on his own way, and you\r\nmake a mutineer of him for life. But I tie him strict up, and he follows\r\nme as kindly as a fowler's spaniel after he has got a good beating.--And\r\nnow your toast and your song, sir,\" addressing Halcro; \"or rather your\r\nsong without your toast. I have got a toast for myself. Here is success\r\nto all roving blades, and confusion to all honest men!\"\r\n\r\n\"I should be sorry to drink that toast, if I could help it,\" said Magnus\r\nTroil.\r\n\r\n\"What! you reckon yourself one of the honest folks, I warrant?\" said\r\nBunce.--\"Tell me your trade, and I'll tell you what I think of it. As\r\nfor the punch-maker here, I knew him at first glance to be a tailor, who\r\nhas, therefore, no more pretensions to be honest, than he has not to be\r\nmangy. But you are some High-Dutch skipper, I warrant me, that tramples\r\non the cross when he is in Japan, and denies his religion for a day's\r\ngain.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied the Udaller, \"I am a gentleman of Zetland.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, what!\" retorted the satirical Mr. Bunce, \"you are come from the\r\nhappy climate where gin is a groat a-bottle, and where there is daylight\r\nfor ever?\"\r\n\r\n\"At your service, Captain,\" said the Udaller, suppressing with much\r\npain some disposition to resent these jests on his country, although\r\nunder every risk, and at all disadvantage.\r\n\r\n\"At _my_ service!\" said Bunce--\"Ay, if there was a rope stretched from\r\nthe wreck to the beach, you would be at my service to cut the hawser,\r\nmake _floatsome_ and _jetsome_ of ship and cargo, and well if you did\r\nnot give me a rap on the head with the back of the cutty-axe; and you\r\ncall yourself honest? But never mind--here goes the aforesaid toast--and\r\ndo you sing me a song, Mr. Fashioner; and look it be as good as your\r\npunch.\"\r\n\r\nHalcro, internally praying for the powers of a new Timotheus, to turn\r\nhis strain and check his auditor's pride, as glorious John had it, began\r\na heart-soothing ditty with the following lines:--\r\n\r\n  \"Maidens fresh as fairest rose,\r\n  Listen to this lay of mine.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will hear nothing of maidens or roses,\" said Bunce; \"it puts me in\r\nmind what sort of a cargo we have got on board; and, by ----, I will be\r\ntrue to my messmate and my captain as long as I can!--And now I think\r\non't, I'll have no more punch either--that last cup made innovation, and\r\nI am not to play Cassio to-night--and if I drink not, nobody else\r\nshall.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he manfully kicked over the bucket, which, notwithstanding\r\nthe repeated applications made to it, was still half full, got up from\r\nhis seat, shook himself a little to rights, as he expressed it, cocked\r\nhis hat, and, walking the quarter-deck with an air of dignity, gave, by\r\nword and signal, the orders for bringing the ships to anchor, which\r\nwere readily obeyed by both, Goffe being then, in all probability, past\r\nany rational state of interference.\r\n\r\nThe Udaller, in the meantime, condoled with Halcro on their situation.\r\n\"It is bad enough,\" said the tough old Norseman; \"for these are rank\r\nrogues--and yet, were it not for the girls, I should not fear them. That\r\nyoung vapouring fellow, who seems to command, is not such a born devil\r\nas he might have been.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has queer humours, though,\" said Halcro; \"and I wish we were loose\r\nfrom him. To kick down a bucket half full of the best punch ever was\r\nmade, and to cut me short in the sweetest song I ever wrote,--I promise\r\nyou, I do not know what he may do next--it is next door to madness.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the ships being brought to anchor, the valiant Lieutenant\r\nBunce called upon Fletcher, and, resuming his seat by his unwilling\r\npassengers, he told them they should see what message he was about to\r\nsend to the wittols of Kirkwall, as they were something concerned in it.\r\n\"It shall run in Dick's name,\" he said, \"as well as in mine. I love to\r\ngive the poor young fellow a little countenance now and then--don't I,\r\nDick, you d----d stupid ass?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes, Jack Bunce,\" said Dick, \"I can't say but as you do--only you\r\nare always bullocking one about something or other, too--but,\r\nhowsomdever, d'ye see\"----\r\n\r\n\"Enough said--belay your jaw, Dick,\" said Bunce, and proceeded to write\r\nhis epistle, which, being read aloud, proved to be of the following\r\ntenor:\r\n\r\n    \"For the Mayor and Aldermen of Kirkwall--Gentlemen, As, contrary\r\n    to your good faith given, you have not sent us on board a hostage\r\n    for the safety of our Captain, remaining on shore at your\r\n    request, these come to tell you, we are not thus to be trifled\r\n    with. We have already in our possession, a brig, with a family of\r\n    distinction, its owners and passengers; and as you deal with our\r\n    Captain, so will we deal with them in every respect. And as this\r\n    is the first, so assure yourselves it shall not be the last damage\r\n    which we will do to your town and trade, if you do not send on\r\n    board our Captain, and supply us with stores according to treaty.\r\n\r\n    \"Given on board the brig Mergoose of Burgh-Westra, lying in\r\n    Inganess Bay. Witness our hands, commanders of the Fortune's\r\n    Favourite, and gentlemen adventurers.\"\r\n\r\nHe then subscribed himself Frederick Altamont, and handed the letter to\r\nFletcher, who read the said subscription with much difficulty; and,\r\nadmiring the sound of it very much, swore he would have a new name\r\nhimself, and the rather that Fletcher was the most crabbed word to spell\r\nand conster, he believed, in the whole dictionary. He subscribed himself\r\naccordingly, Timothy Tugmutton.\r\n\r\n\"Will you not add a few lines to the coxcombs?\" said Bunce, addressing\r\nMagnus.\r\n\r\n\"Not I,\" returned the Udaller, stubborn in his ideas of right and wrong,\r\neven in so formidable an emergency. \"The Magistrates of Kirkwall know\r\ntheir duty, and were I they\"----But here the recollection that his\r\ndaughters were at the mercy of these ruffians, blanked the bold visage\r\nof Magnus Troil, and checked the defiance which was just about to issue\r\nfrom his lips.\r\n\r\n\"D----n me,\" said Bunce, who easily conjectured what was passing in the\r\nmind of his prisoner--\"that pause would have told well on the stage--it\r\nwould have brought down pit, box, and gallery, egad, as Bayes has it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will hear nothing of Bayes,\" said Claud Halcro, (himself a little\r\nelevated,) \"it is an impudent satire on glorious John; but he tickled\r\nBuckingham off for it--\r\n\r\n  'In the first rank of these did Zimri stand;\r\n  A man so various'\"----\r\n\r\n\"Hold your peace!\" said Bunce, drowning the voice of the admirer of\r\nDryden in louder and more vehement asseveration, \"the Rehearsal is the\r\nbest farce ever was written--and I'll make him kiss the gunner's\r\ndaughter that denies it. D----n me, I was the best Prince Prettyman\r\never walked the boards--\r\n\r\n  'Sometimes a fisher's son, sometimes a prince.'\r\n\r\nBut let us to business.--Hark ye, old gentleman,\" (to Magnus,) \"you have\r\na sort of sulkiness about you, for which some of my profession would cut\r\nyour ears out of your head, and broil them for your dinner with red\r\npepper. I have known Goffe do so to a poor devil, for looking sour and\r\ndangerous when he saw his sloop go to Davy Jones's locker with his only\r\nson on board. But I'm a spirit of another sort; and if you or the ladies\r\nare ill used, it shall be the Kirkwall people's fault, and not mine, and\r\nthat's fair; and so you had better let them know your condition, and\r\nyour circumstances, and so forth,--and that's fair, too.\"\r\n\r\nMagnus, thus exhorted, took up the pen, and attempted to write; but his\r\nhigh spirit so struggled with his paternal anxiety, that his hand\r\nrefused its office. \"I cannot help it,\" he said, after one or two\r\nillegible attempts to write--\"I cannot form a letter, if all our lives\r\ndepended upon it.\"\r\n\r\nAnd he could not, with his utmost efforts, so suppress the convulsive\r\nemotions which he experienced, but that they agitated his whole frame.\r\nThe willow which bends to the tempest, often escapes better than the oak\r\nwhich resists it; and so, in great calamities, it sometimes happens,\r\nthat light and frivolous spirits recover their elasticity and presence\r\nof mind sooner than those of a loftier character. In the present case,\r\nClaud Halcro was fortunately able to perform the task which the deeper\r\nfeelings of his friend and patron refused. He took the pen, and, in as\r\nfew words as possible, explained the situation in which they were\r\nplaced, and the cruel risks to which they were exposed, insinuating at\r\nthe same time, as delicately as he could express it, that, to the\r\nmagistrates of the country, the life and honour of its citizens should\r\nbe a dearer object than even the apprehension or punishment of the\r\nguilty; taking care, however, to qualify the last expression as much as\r\npossible, for fear of giving umbrage to the pirates.\r\n\r\nBunce read over the letter, which fortunately met his approbation; and,\r\non seeing the name of Claud Halcro at the bottom, he exclaimed, in great\r\nsurprise, and with more energetic expressions of asseveration than we\r\nchoose to record--\"Why, you are the little fellow that played the fiddle\r\nto old Manager Gadabout's company, at Hogs Norton, the first season I\r\ncame out there! I thought I knew your catchword of glorious John.\"\r\n\r\nAt another time this recognition might not have been very grateful to\r\nHalcro's minstrel pride; but, as matters stood with him, the discovery\r\nof a golden mine could not have made him more happy. He instantly\r\nremembered the very hopeful young performer who came out in Don\r\nSebastian, and judiciously added, that the muse of glorious John had\r\nnever received such excellent support during the time that he was first\r\n(he might have added, and only) violin to Mr. Gadabout's company.\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes,\" said Bunce, \"I believe you are right--I think I might have\r\nshaken the scene as well as Booth or Betterton either. But I was\r\ndestined to figure on other boards,\" (striking his foot upon the deck,)\r\n\"and I believe I must stick by them, till I find no board at all to\r\nsupport me. But now, old acquaintance, I will do something for you--slue\r\nyourself this way a bit--I would have you solus.\" They leaned over the\r\ntaffrail, while Bunce whispered with more seriousness than he usually\r\nshowed, \"I am sorry for this honest old heart of Norway pine--blight me\r\nif I am not--and for the daughters too--besides, I have my own reasons\r\nfor befriending one of them. I can be a wild fellow with a willing lass\r\nof the game; but to such decent and innocent creatures--d----n me, I am\r\nScipio at Numantia, and Alexander in the tent of Darius. You remember\r\nhow I touch off Alexander?\" (here he started into heroics.)\r\n\r\n  \"'Thus from the grave I rise to save my love;\r\n  All draw your swords, with wings of lightning move.\r\n  When I rush on, sure none will dare to stay--\r\n  'Tis beauty calls, and glory shows the way.'\"\r\n\r\nClaud Halcro failed not to bestow the necessary commendations on his\r\ndeclamation, declaring, that, in his opinion as an honest man, he had\r\nalways thought Mr. Altamont's giving that speech far superior in tone\r\nand energy to Betterton.\r\n\r\nBunce, or Altamont, wrung his hand tenderly. \"Ah, you flatter me, my\r\ndear friend,\" he said; \"yet, why had not the public some of your\r\njudgment!--I should not then have been at this pass. Heaven knows, my\r\ndear Mr. Halcro--Heaven knows with what pleasure I could keep you on\r\nboard with me, just that I might have one friend who loves as much to\r\nhear, as I do to recite, the choicest pieces of our finest dramatic\r\nauthors. The most of us are beasts--and, for the Kirkwall hostage\r\nyonder, he uses me, egad, as I use Fletcher, I think, and huffs me the\r\nmore, the more I do for him. But how delightful it would be in a tropic\r\nnight, when the ship was hanging on the breeze, with a broad and steady\r\nsail, for me to rehearse Alexander, with you for my pit, box, and\r\ngallery! Nay, (for you are a follower of the muses, as I remember,) who\r\nknows but you and I might be the means of inspiring, like Orpheus and\r\nEurydice, a pure taste into our companions, and softening their manners,\r\nwhile we excited their better feelings?\"\r\n\r\nThis was spoken with so much unction, that Claud Halcro began to be\r\nafraid he had both made the actual punch over potent, and mixed too many\r\nbewitching ingredients in the cup of flattery which he had administered;\r\nand that, under the influence of both potions, the sentimental pirate\r\nmight detain him by force, merely to realize the scenes which his\r\nimagination presented. The conjuncture was, however, too delicate to\r\nadmit of any active effort, on Halcro's part, to redeem his blunder, and\r\ntherefore he only returned the tender pressure of his friend's hand, and\r\nuttered the interjection \"alas!\" in as pathetic a tone as he could.\r\n\r\nBunce immediately resumed: \"You are right, my friend, these are but\r\nvain visions of felicity, and it remains but for the unhappy Altamont to\r\nserve the friend to whom he is now to bid farewell. I have determined to\r\nput you and the two girls ashore, with Fletcher for your protection; and\r\nso call up the young women, and let them begone before the devil get\r\naboard of me, or of some one else. You will carry my letter to the\r\nmagistrates, and second it with your own eloquence, and assure them,\r\nthat if they hurt but one hair of Cleveland's head, there will be the\r\ndevil to pay, and no pitch hot.\"\r\n\r\nRelieved at heart by this unexpected termination of Bunce's harangue,\r\nHalcro descended the companion ladder two steps at a time, and knocking\r\nat the cabin door, could scarce find intelligible language enough to say\r\nhis errand. The sisters hearing, with unexpected joy, that they were to\r\nbe set ashore, muffled themselves in their cloaks, and, when they\r\nlearned that the boat was hoisted out, came hastily on deck, where they\r\nwere apprized, for the first time, to their great horror, that their\r\nfather was still to remain on board of the pirate.\r\n\r\n\"We will remain with him at every risk,\" said Minna--\"we may be of some\r\nassistance to him, were it but for an instant--we will live and die with\r\nhim!\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall aid him more surely,\" said Brenda, who comprehended the nature\r\nof their situation better than Minna, \"by interesting the people of\r\nKirkwall to grant these gentlemen's demands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Spoken like an angel of sense and beauty,\" said Bunce; \"and now away\r\nwith you; for, d----n me, if this is not like having a lighted linstock\r\nin the powder-room--if you speak another word more, confound me if I\r\nknow how I shall bring myself to part with you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Go, in God's name, my daughters,\" said Magnus. \"I am in God's hand; and\r\nwhen you are gone I shall care little for myself--and I shall think and\r\nsay, as long as I live, that this good gentleman deserves a better\r\ntrade.--Go--go--away with you!\"--for they yet lingered in reluctance to\r\nleave him.\r\n\r\n\"Stay not to kiss,\" said Bunce, \"for fear I be tempted to ask my share.\r\nInto the boat with you--yet stop an instant.\" He drew the three captives\r\napart--\"Fletcher,\" said he, \"will answer for the rest of the fellows,\r\nand will see you safe off the sea-beach. But how to answer for Fletcher,\r\nI know not, except by trusting Mr. Halcro with this little guarantee.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHe offered the minstrel a small double-barrelled pistol, which, he said,\r\nwas loaded with a brace of balls. Minna observed Halcro's hand tremble\r\nas he stretched it out to take the weapon. \"Give it to me, sir,\" she\r\nsaid, taking it from the outlaw; \"and trust to me for defending my\r\nsister and myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo, bravo!\" shouted Bunce. \"There spoke a wench worthy of Cleveland,\r\nthe King of Rovers!\"\r\n\r\n\"Cleveland!\" repeated Minna, \"do you then know that Cleveland, whom you\r\nhave twice named?\"\r\n\r\n\"Know him! Is there a man alive,\" said Bunce, \"that knows better than I\r\ndo the best and stoutest fellow ever stepped betwixt stem and stern?\r\nWhen he is out of the bilboes, as please Heaven he shall soon be, I\r\nreckon to see you come on board of us, and reign the queen of every sea\r\nwe sail over.--You have got the little guardian; I suppose you know how\r\nto use it? If Fletcher behaves ill to you, you need only draw up this\r\npiece of iron with your thumb, so--and if he persists, it is but\r\ncrooking your pretty forefinger thus, and I shall lose the most dutiful\r\nmessmate that ever man had--though, d----n the dog, he will deserve his\r\ndeath if he disobeys my orders. And now, into the boat--but stay, one\r\nkiss for Cleveland's sake.\"\r\n\r\nBrenda, in deadly terror, endured his courtesy, but Minna, stepping back\r\nwith disdain, offered her hand. Bunce laughed, but kissed, with a\r\ntheatrical air, the fair hand which she extended as a ransom for her\r\nlips, and at length the sisters and Halcro were placed in the boat,\r\nwhich rowed off under Fletcher's command.\r\n\r\nBunce stood on the quarter-deck, soliloquizing after the manner of his\r\noriginal profession. \"Were this told at Port-Royal now, or at the isle\r\nof Providence, or in the Petits Guaves, I wonder what they would say of\r\nme! Why, that I was a good-natured milksop--a Jack-a-lent--an\r\nass.--Well, let them. I have done enough of bad to think about it; it is\r\nworth while doing one good action, if it were but for the rarity of the\r\nthing, and to put one in good humour with oneself.\" Then turning to\r\nMagnus Troil, he proceeded--\"By ---- these are bona-robas, these\r\ndaughters of yours! The eldest would make her fortune on the London\r\nboards. What a dashing attitude the wench had with her, as she seized\r\nthe pistol!--d----n me, that touch would have brought the house down!\r\nWhat a Roxalana the jade would have made!\" (for, in his oratory, Bunce,\r\nlike Sancho's gossip, Thomas Cecial, was apt to use the most energetic\r\nword which came to hand, without accurately considering its propriety.)\r\n\"I would give my share of the next prize but to hear her spout--\r\n\r\n  'Away, begone, and give a whirlwind room,\r\n  Or I will blow you up like dust.--Avaunt!\r\n  Madness but meanly represents my rage.'\r\n\r\nAnd then, again, that little, soft, shy, tearful trembler, for Statira,\r\nto hear her recite--\r\n\r\n  'He speaks the kindest words, and looks such things,\r\n  Vows with such passion, swears with so much grace,\r\n  That 'tis a kind of heaven to be deluded by him.'\r\n\r\nWhat a play we might have run up!--I was a beast not to think of it\r\nbefore I sent them off--I to be Alexander--Claud Halcro,\r\nLysimachus--this old gentleman might have made a Clytus, for a pinch. I\r\nwas an idiot not to think of it!\"\r\n\r\nThere was much in this effusion which might have displeased the Udaller;\r\nbut, to speak truth, he paid no attention to it. His eye, and, finally,\r\nhis spy-glass, were employed in watching the return of his daughters to\r\nthe shore. He saw them land on the beach, and, accompanied by Halcro,\r\nand another man, (Fletcher, doubtless,) he saw them ascend the\r\nacclivity, and proceed upon the road to Kirkwall; and he could even\r\ndistinguish that Minna, as if considering herself as the guardian of the\r\nparty, walked a little aloof from the rest, on the watch, as it seemed,\r\nagainst surprise, and ready to act as occasion should require. At\r\nlength, as the Udaller was just about to lose sight of them, he had the\r\nexquisite satisfaction to see the party halt, and the pirate leave them,\r\nafter a space just long enough for a civil farewell, and proceed slowly\r\nback, on his return to the beach. Blessing the Great Being who had thus\r\nrelieved him from the most agonizing fears which a father can feel, the\r\nworthy Udaller, from that instant, stood resigned to his own fate,\r\nwhatever that might be.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[38] Liquor brewed for a Christmas treat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n  Over the mountains and under the waves,\r\n  Over the fountains and under the graves,\r\n        Over floods that are deepest,\r\n          Which Neptune obey,\r\n        Over rocks that are steepest,\r\n          Love will find out the way.\r\n\r\n                                                 _Old Song._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe parting of Fletcher from Claud Halcro and the sisters of\r\nBurgh-Westra, on the spot where it took place, was partly occasioned by\r\na small party of armed men being seen at a distance in the act of\r\nadvancing from Kirkwall, an apparition hidden from the Udaller's\r\nspy-glass by the swell of the ground, but quite visible to the pirate,\r\nwhom it determined to consult his own safety by a speedy return to his\r\nboat. He was just turning away, when Minna occasioned the short delay\r\nwhich her father had observed.\r\n\r\n\"Stop,\" she said; \"I command you!--Tell your leader from me, that\r\nwhatever the answer may be from Kirkwall, he shall carry his vessel,\r\nnevertheless, round to Stromness; and, being anchored there, let him\r\nsend a boat ashore for Captain Cleveland when he shall see a smoke on\r\nthe Bridge of Broisgar.\"\r\n\r\nFletcher had thought, like his messmate Bunce of asking a kiss, at\r\nleast, for the trouble of escorting these beautiful young women; and\r\nperhaps, neither the terror of the approaching Kirkwall men, nor of\r\nMinna's weapon, might have prevented his being insolent. But the name of\r\nhis Captain, and, still more, the unappalled, dignified, and commanding\r\nmanner of Minna Troil, overawed him. He made a sea bow,--promised to\r\nkeep a sharp look-out, and, returning to his boat, went on board with\r\nhis message.\r\n\r\nAs Halcro and the sisters advanced towards the party whom they saw on\r\nthe Kirkwall road, and who, on their part, had halted as if to observe\r\nthem, Brenda, relieved from the fears of Fletcher's presence, which had\r\nhitherto kept her silent, exclaimed, \"Merciful Heaven!--Minna, in what\r\nhands have we left our dear father?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the hands of brave men,\" said Minna, steadily--\"I fear not for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"As brave as you please,\" said Claud Halcro, \"but very dangerous rogues\r\nfor all that.--I know that fellow Altamont, as he calls himself, though\r\nthat is not his right name neither, as deboshed a dog as ever made a\r\nbarn ring with blood and blank verse. He began with Barnwell, and every\r\nbody thought he would end with the gallows, like the last scene in\r\nVenice Preserved.\"\r\n\r\n\"It matters not,\" said Minna--\"the wilder the waves, the more powerful\r\nis the voice that rules them. The name alone of Cleveland ruled the mood\r\nof the fiercest amongst them.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sorry for Cleveland,\" said Brenda, \"if such are his\r\ncompanions,--but I care little for him in comparison to my father.\"\r\n\r\n\"Reserve your compassion for those who need it,\" said Minna, \"and fear\r\nnothing for our father.--God knows, every silver hair on his head is to\r\nme worth the treasure of an unsummed mine; but I know that he is safe\r\nwhile in yonder vessel, and I know that he will be soon safe on shore.\"\r\n\r\n\"I would I could see it,\" said Claud Halcro; \"but I fear the Kirkwall\r\npeople, supposing Cleveland to be such as I dread, will not dare to\r\nexchange him against the Udaller. The Scots have very severe laws\r\nagainst theft-boot, as they call it.\"\r\n\r\n\"But who are those on the road before us?\" said Brenda; \"and why do they\r\nhalt there so jealously?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are a patrol of the militia,\" answered Halcro. \"Glorious John\r\ntouches them off a little sharply,--but then John was a Jacobite,--(_e_)\r\n\r\n  'Mouths without hands, maintain'd at vast expense,\r\n  In peace a charge, in war a weak defence;\r\n  Stout once a-month, they march, a blustering band,\r\n  And ever, but in time of need, at hand.'\r\n\r\nI fancy they halted just now, taking us, as they saw us on the brow of\r\nthe hill, for a party of the sloop's men, and now they can distinguish\r\nthat you wear petticoats, they are moving on again.\"\r\n\r\nThey came on accordingly, and proved to be, as Claud Halcro had\r\nsuggested, a patrol sent out to watch the motions of the pirates, and to\r\nprevent their attempting descents to damage the country.\r\n\r\nThey heartily congratulated Claud Halcro, who was well known to more\r\nthan one of them, upon his escape from captivity; and the commander of\r\nthe party, while offering every assistance to the ladies, could not help\r\ncondoling with them on the circumstances in which their father stood,\r\nhinting, though in a delicate and doubtful manner, the difficulties\r\nwhich might be in the way of his liberation.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at Kirkwall, and obtained an audience of the Provost,\r\nand one or two of the Magistrates, these difficulties were more plainly\r\ninsisted upon.--\"The Halcyon frigate is upon the coast,\" said the\r\nProvost; \"she was seen off Duncansbay-head; and, though I have the\r\ndeepest respect for Mr. Troil of Burgh-Westra, yet I shall be answerable\r\nto law if I release from prison the Captain of this suspicious vessel,\r\non account of the safety of any individual who may be unhappily\r\nendangered by his detention. This man is now known to be the heart and\r\nsoul of these buccaniers, and am I at liberty to send him aboard, that\r\nhe may plunder the country, or perhaps go fight the King's ship?--for he\r\nhas impudence enough for any thing.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Courage_ enough for any thing, you mean, Mr. Provost,\" said Minna,\r\nunable to restrain her displeasure.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you may call it as you please, Miss Troil,\" said the worthy\r\nMagistrate; \"but, in my opinion, that sort of courage which proposes to\r\nfight singly against two, is little better than a kind of practical\r\nimpudence.\"\r\n\r\n\"But our father?\" said Brenda, in a tone of the most earnest\r\nentreaty--\"our father--the friend, I may say the father, of his\r\ncountry--to whom so many look for kindness, and so many for actual\r\nsupport--whose loss would be the extinction of a beacon in a storm--will\r\nyou indeed weigh the risk which he runs, against such a trifling thing\r\nas letting an unfortunate man from prison, to seek his unhappy fate\r\nelsewhere?\"\r\n\r\n\"Miss Brenda is right,\" said Claud Halcro; \"I am for let-a-be for\r\nlet-a-be, as the boys say; and never fash about a warrant of\r\nliberation, Provost, but just take a fool's counsel, and let the goodman\r\nof the jail forget to draw his bolt on the wicket, or leave a chink of a\r\nwindow open, or the like, and we shall be rid of the rover, and have the\r\none best honest fellow in Orkney or Zetland on the lee-side of a bowl of\r\npunch with us in five hours.\"\r\n\r\nThe Provost replied in nearly the same terms as before, that he had the\r\nhighest respect for Mr. Magnus Troil of Burgh-Westra, but that he could\r\nnot suffer his consideration for any individual, however respectable, to\r\ninterfere with the discharge of his duty.\r\n\r\nMinna then addressed her sister in a tone of calm and sarcastic\r\ndispleasure.--\"You forget,\" she said, \"Brenda, that you are talking of\r\nthe safety of a poor insignificant Udaller of Zetland, to no less a\r\nperson than the Chief Magistrate of the metropolis of Orkney--can you\r\nexpect so great a person to condescend to such a trifling subject of\r\nconsideration? It will be time enough for the Provost to think of\r\ncomplying with the terms sent to him--for comply with them at length he\r\nboth must and will--when the Church of Saint Magnus is beat down about\r\nhis ears.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may be angry with me, my pretty young lady,\" said the good-humoured\r\nProvost Torfe, \"but I cannot be offended with you. The Church of Saint\r\nMagnus has stood many a day, and, I think, will outlive both you and me,\r\nmuch more yonder pack of unhanged dogs. And besides that your father is\r\nhalf an Orkneyman, and has both estate and friends among us, I would, I\r\ngive you my word, do as much for a Zetlander in distress as I would for\r\nany one, excepting one of our own native Kirkwallers, who are doubtless\r\nto be preferred. And if you will take up your lodgings here with my wife\r\nand myself, we will endeavour to show you,\" continued he, \"that you are\r\nas welcome in Kirkwall, as ever you could be in Lerwick or Scalloway.\"\r\n\r\nMinna deigned no reply to this good-humoured invitation, but Brenda\r\ndeclined it in civil terms, pleading the necessity of taking up their\r\nabode with a wealthy widow of Kirkwall, a relation, who already expected\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHalcro made another attempt to move the Provost, but found him\r\ninexorable.--\"The Collector of the Customs had already threatened,\" he\r\nsaid, \"to inform against him for entering into treaty, or, as he called\r\nit, packing and peeling with those strangers, even when it seemed the\r\nonly means of preventing a bloody affray in the town; and, should he now\r\nforego the advantage afforded by the imprisonment of Cleveland and the\r\nescape of the Factor, he might incur something worse than censure.\" The\r\nburden of the whole was, \"that he was sorry for the Udaller, he was\r\nsorry even for the lad Cleveland, who had some sparks of honour about\r\nhim; but his duty was imperious, and must be obeyed.\" The Provost then\r\nprecluded farther argument, by observing, that another affair from\r\nZetland called for his immediate attention. A gentleman named Mertoun,\r\nresiding at Jarlshof, had made complaint against Snailsfoot the Jagger,\r\nfor having assisted a domestic of his in embezzling some valuable\r\narticles which had been deposited in his custody, and he was about to\r\ntake examinations on the subject, and cause them to be restored to Mr.\r\nMertoun, who was accountable for them to the right owner.\r\n\r\nIn all this information, there was nothing which seemed interesting to\r\nthe sisters excepting the word Mertoun, which went like a dagger to the\r\nheart of Minna, when she recollected the circumstances under which\r\nMordaunt Mertoun had disappeared, and which, with an emotion less\r\npainful, though still of a melancholy nature, called a faint blush into\r\nBrenda's cheek, and a slight degree of moisture into her eye. But it was\r\nsoon evident that the Magistrate spoke not of Mordaunt, but of his\r\nfather; and the daughters of Magnus, little interested in his detail,\r\ntook leave of the Provost to go to their own lodgings.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at their relation's, Minna made it her business to\r\nlearn, by such enquiries as she could make without exciting suspicion,\r\nwhat was the situation of the unfortunate Cleveland, which she soon\r\ndiscovered to be exceedingly precarious. The Provost had not, indeed,\r\ncommitted him to close custody, as Claud Halcro had anticipated,\r\nrecollecting, perhaps, the favourable circumstances under which he had\r\nsurrendered himself, and loath, till the moment of the last necessity,\r\naltogether to break faith with him. But although left apparently at\r\nlarge, he was strictly watched by persons well armed and appointed for\r\nthe purpose, who had directions to detain him by force, if he attempted\r\nto pass certain narrow precincts which were allotted to him. He was\r\nquartered in a strong room within what is called the King's Castle, and\r\nat night his chamber door was locked on the outside, and a sufficient\r\nguard mounted to prevent his escape. He therefore enjoyed only the\r\ndegree of liberty which the cat, in her cruel sport, is sometimes\r\npleased to permit to the mouse which she has clutched; and yet, such was\r\nthe terror of the resources, the courage, and ferocity of the pirate\r\nCaptain, that the Provost was blamed by the Collector, and many other\r\nsage citizens of Kirkwall, for permitting him to be at large upon any\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nIt may be well believed, that, under such circumstances, Cleveland had\r\nno desire to seek any place of public resort, conscious that he was the\r\nobject of a mixed feeling of curiosity and terror. His favourite place\r\nof exercise, therefore, was the external aisles of the Cathedral of\r\nSaint Magnus, of which the eastern end alone is fitted up for public\r\nworship. This solemn old edifice, having escaped the ravage which\r\nattended the first convulsions of the Reformation, still retains some\r\nappearance of episcopal dignity. This place of worship is separated by a\r\nscreen from the nave and western limb of the cross, and the whole is\r\npreserved in a state of cleanliness and decency, which might be well\r\nproposed as an example to the proud piles of Westminster and St. Paul's.\r\n\r\nIt was in this exterior part of the Cathedral that Cleveland was\r\npermitted to walk, the rather that his guards, by watching the single\r\nopen entrance, had the means, with very little inconvenience to\r\nthemselves, of preventing any possible attempt at escape. The place\r\nitself was well suited to his melancholy circumstances. The lofty and\r\nvaulted roof rises upon ranges of Saxon pillars, of massive size, four\r\nof which, still larger than the rest, once supported the lofty spire,\r\nwhich, long since destroyed by accident, has been rebuilt upon a\r\ndisproportioned and truncated plan. The light is admitted at the eastern\r\nend through a lofty, well-proportioned, and richly-ornamented Gothic\r\nwindow; and the pavement is covered with inscriptions, in different\r\nlanguages, distinguishing the graves of noble Orcadians, who have at\r\ndifferent times been deposited within the sacred precincts.\r\n\r\nHere walked Cleveland, musing over the events of a misspent life, which,\r\nit seemed probable, might be brought to a violent and shameful close,\r\nwhile he was yet in the prime of youth.--\"With these dead,\" he said,\r\nlooking on the pavement, \"shall I soon be numbered--but no holy man will\r\nspeak a blessing; no friendly hand register an inscription; no proud\r\ndescendant sculpture armorial bearings over the grave of the pirate\r\nCleveland. My whitening bones will swing in the gibbet-irons, on some\r\nwild beach or lonely cape, that will be esteemed fatal and accursed for\r\nmy sake. The old mariner, as he passes the Sound, will shake his head,\r\nand tell of my name and actions, as a warning to his younger\r\ncomrades.--But, Minna! Minna!--what will be thy thoughts when the news\r\nreaches thee?--Would to God the tidings were drowned in the deepest\r\nwhirlpool betwixt Kirkwall and Burgh-Westra, ere they came to her\r\near!--and O! would to Heaven that we had never met, since we never can\r\nmeet again!\"\r\n\r\nHe lifted up his eyes as he spoke, and Minna Troil stood before him. Her\r\nface was pale, and her hair dishevelled; but her look was composed and\r\nfirm, with its usual expression of high-minded melancholy. She was still\r\nshrouded in the large mantle which she had assumed on leaving the\r\nvessel. Cleveland's first emotion was astonishment; his next was joy,\r\nnot unmixed with awe. He would have exclaimed--he would have thrown\r\nhimself at her feet--but she imposed at once silence and composure on\r\nhim, by raising her finger, and saying, in a low but commanding\r\naccent,--\"Be cautious--we are observed--there are men without--they let\r\nme enter with difficulty. I dare not remain long--they would think--they\r\nmight believe--O, Cleveland! I have hazarded every thing to save you!\"\r\n\r\n\"To save me?--Alas! poor Minna!\" answered Cleveland, \"to save me is\r\nimpossible.--Enough that I have seen you once more, were it but to say,\r\nfor ever farewell!\"\r\n\r\n\"We must indeed say farewell,\" said Minna; \"for fate, and your guilt,\r\nhave divided us for ever.--Cleveland, I have seen your associates--need\r\nI tell you more--need I say, that I know now what a pirate is?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been in the ruffians' power!\" said Cleveland, with a start of\r\nagony--\"Did they presume\"----\r\n\r\n\"Cleveland,\" replied Minna, \"they presumed nothing--your name was a\r\nspell over them. By the power of that spell over these ferocious\r\nbanditti, and by that alone, I was reminded of the qualities I once\r\nthought my Cleveland's!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Cleveland, proudly, \"my name has and shall have power over\r\nthem, when they are at the wildest; and, had they harmed you by one rude\r\nword, they should have found--Yet what do I rave about--I am a\r\nprisoner!\"\r\n\r\n\"You shall be so no longer,\" said Minna--\"Your safety--the safety of my\r\ndear father--all demand your instant freedom. I have formed a scheme for\r\nyour liberty, which, boldly executed, cannot fail. The light is fading\r\nwithout--muffle yourself in my cloak, and you will easily pass the\r\nguards--I have given them the means of carousing, and they are deeply\r\nengaged. Haste to the Loch of Stennis, and hide yourself till day dawns;\r\nthen make a smoke on the point, where the land, stretching into the\r\nlake on each side, divides it nearly in two at the Bridge of Broisgar.\r\nYour vessel, which lies not far distant, will send a boat ashore.--Do\r\nnot hesitate an instant!\"\r\n\r\n\"But you, Minna!--Should this wild scheme succeed,\" said Cleveland,\r\n\"what is to become of you?\"\r\n\r\n\"For my share in your escape,\" answered the maiden, \"the honesty of my\r\nown intention will vindicate me in the sight of Heaven; and the safety\r\nof my father, whose fate depends on yours, will be my excuse to man.\"\r\n\r\nIn a few words, she gave him the history of their capture, and its\r\nconsequences. Cleveland cast up his eyes and raised his hands to Heaven,\r\nin thankfulness for the escape of the sisters from his evil companions,\r\nand then hastily added,--\"But you are right, Minna; I must fly at all\r\nrates--for your father's sake I must fly.--Here, then, we part--yet not,\r\nI trust, for ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"For ever!\" answered a voice, that sounded as from a sepulchral vault.\r\n\r\nThey started, looked around them, and then gazed on each other. It\r\nseemed as if the echoes of the building had returned Cleveland's last\r\nwords, but the pronunciation was too emphatically accented.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, for ever!\" said Norna of the Fitful-head, stepping forward from\r\nbehind one of the massive Saxon pillars which support the roof of the\r\nCathedral. \"Here meet the crimson foot and the crimson hand. Well for\r\nboth that the wound is healed whence that crimson was derived--well for\r\nboth, but best, for him who shed it.--Here, then, you meet--and meet for\r\nthe last time!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so,\" said Cleveland, as if about to take Minna's hand; \"to\r\nseparate me from Minna, while I have life, must be the work of herself\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Away!\" said Norna, stepping betwixt them,--\"away with such idle\r\nfolly!--Nourish no vain dreams of future meetings--you part here, and\r\nyou part for ever. The hawk pairs not with the dove; guilt matches not\r\nwith innocence.--Minna Troil, you look for the last time on this bold\r\nand criminal man--Cleveland, you behold Minna for the last time!\"\r\n\r\n\"And dream you,\" said Cleveland, indignantly, \"that your mummery imposes\r\non me, and that I am among the fools who see more than trick in your\r\npretended art?\"\r\n\r\n\"Forbear, Cleveland, forbear!\" said Minna, her hereditary awe of Norna\r\naugmented by the circumstance of her sudden appearance. \"O,\r\nforbear!--she is powerful--she is but too powerful.--And do you, O\r\nNorna, remember my father's safety is linked with Cleveland's.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it is well for Cleveland that I do remember it,\" replied the\r\nPythoness--\"and that, for the sake of one, I am here to aid both. You,\r\nwith your childish purpose, of passing one of his bulk and stature under\r\nthe disguise of a few paltry folds of wadmaal--what would your device\r\nhave procured him but instant restraint with bolt and shackle?--I will\r\nsave him--I will place him in security on board his bark. But let him\r\nrenounce these shores for ever, and carry elsewhere the terrors of his\r\nsable flag, and his yet blacker name; for if the sun rises twice, and\r\nfinds him still at anchor, his blood be on his own head.--Ay, look to\r\neach other--look the last look that I permit to frail affection,--and\r\nsay, if ye _can_ say it, Farewell for ever!\"\r\n\r\n\"Obey her,\" stammered Minna; \"remonstrate not, but obey her.\"\r\n\r\nCleveland, grasping her hand, and kissing it ardently, said, but so low\r\nthat she only could hear it, \"Farewell, Minna, but _not_ for ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now, maiden, begone,\" said Norna, \"and leave the rest to the\r\nReimkennar.\"\r\n\r\n\"One word more,\" said Minna, \"and I obey you. Tell me but if I have\r\ncaught aright your meaning--Is Mordaunt Mertoun safe and recovered?\"\r\n\r\n\"Recovered, and safe,\" said Norna; \"else woe to the hand that shed his\r\nblood!\"\r\n\r\nMinna slowly sought the door of the Cathedral, and turned back from time\r\nto time to look at the shadowy form of Norna, and the stately and\r\nmilitary figure of Cleveland, as they stood together in the deepening\r\ngloom of the ancient Cathedral. When she looked back a second time they\r\nwere in motion, and Cleveland followed the matron, as, with a slow and\r\nsolemn step, she glided towards one of the side aisles. When Minna\r\nlooked back a third time, their figures were no longer visible. She\r\ncollected herself, and walked on to the eastern door by which she had\r\nentered, and listened for an instant to the guard, who talked together\r\non the outside.\r\n\r\n\"The Zetland girl stays a long time with this pirate fellow,\" said one.\r\n\"I wish they have not more to speak about than the ransom of her\r\nfather.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, truly,\" answered another, \"the wenches will have more sympathy with\r\na handsome young pirate, than an old bed-ridden burgher.\"\r\n\r\nTheir discourse was here interrupted by her of whom they were speaking;\r\nand, as if taken in the manner, they pulled off their hats, made their\r\nawkward obeisances, and looked not a little embarrassed and confused.\r\n\r\nMinna returned to the house where she lodged, much affected, yet, on the\r\nwhole, pleased with the result of her expedition, which seemed to put\r\nher father out of danger, and assured her at once of the escape of\r\nCleveland, and of the safety of young Mordaunt. She hastened to\r\ncommunicate both pieces of intelligence to Brenda, who joined her in\r\nthankfulness to Heaven, and was herself wellnigh persuaded to believe in\r\nNorna's supernatural pretensions, so much was she pleased with the\r\nmanner in which they had been employed. Some time was spent in\r\nexchanging their mutual congratulations, and mingling tears of hope,\r\nmixed with apprehension; when, at a late hour in the evening, they were\r\ninterrupted by Claud Halcro, who, full of a fidgeting sort of\r\nimportance, not unmingled with fear, came to acquaint them, that the\r\nprisoner, Cleveland, had disappeared from the Cathedral, in which he had\r\nbeen permitted to walk, and that the Provost, having been informed that\r\nMinna was accessary to his flight, was coming, in a mighty quandary, to\r\nmake enquiry into the circumstances.\r\n\r\nWhen the worthy Magistrate arrived, Minna did not conceal from him her\r\nown wish that Cleveland should make his escape, as the only means which\r\nshe saw of redeeming her father from imminent danger. But that she had\r\nany actual accession to his flight, she positively denied; and stated,\r\n\"that she had parted from Cleveland in the Cathedral, more than two\r\nhours since, and then left him in company with a third person, whose\r\nname she did not conceive herself obliged to communicate.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not needful, Miss Minna Troil,\" answered Provost Torfe; \"for,\r\nalthough no person but this Captain Cleveland and yourself was seen to\r\nenter the Kirk of St. Magnus this day, we know well enough that your\r\ncousin, old Ulla Troil, whom you Zetlanders call Norna of Fitful-head,\r\nhas been cruising up and down, upon sea and land, and air, for what I\r\nknow, in boats and on ponies, and it may be on broomsticks; and here has\r\nbeen her dumb Drow, too, coming and going, and playing the spy on every\r\none--and a good spy he is, for he can hear every thing, and tells\r\nnothing again, unless to his mistress. And we know, besides, that she\r\ncan enter the Kirk when all the doors are fast, and has been seen there\r\nmore than once, God save us from the Evil One!--and so, without farther\r\nquestions asked, I conclude it was old Norna whom you left in the Kirk\r\nwith this slashing blade--and, if so, they may catch them again that\r\ncan.--I cannot but say, however, pretty Mistress Minna, that you Zetland\r\nfolks seem to forget both law and gospel, when you use the help of\r\nwitchcraft to fetch delinquents out of a legal prison; and the least\r\nthat you, or your cousin, or your father, can do, is to use influence\r\nwith this wild fellow to go away as soon as possible, without hurting\r\nthe town or trade, and then there will be little harm in what has\r\nchanced; for, Heaven knows, I did not seek the poor lad's life, so I\r\ncould get my hands free of him without blame; and far less did I wish,\r\nthat, through his imprisonment, any harm should come to worthy Magnus\r\nTroil of Burgh-Westra.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see where the shoe pinches you, Mr. Provost,\" said Claud Halcro, \"and\r\nI am sure I can answer for my friend Mr. Troil, as well as for myself,\r\nthat we will say and do all in our power with this man, Captain\r\nCleveland, to make him leave the coast directly.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" said Minna, \"am so convinced that what you recommend is best\r\nfor all parties, that my sister and I will set off early to-morrow\r\nmorning to the House of Stennis, if Mr. Halcro will give us his escort,\r\nto receive my father when he comes ashore, that we may acquaint him with\r\nyour wish, and to use every influence to induce this unhappy man to\r\nleave the country.\"\r\n\r\nProvost Torfe looked upon her with some surprise. \"It is not every young\r\nwoman,\" he said, \"would wish to move eight miles nearer to a band of\r\npirates.\"\r\n\r\n\"We run no risk,\" said Claud Halcro, interfering. \"The House of Stennis\r\nis strong; and my cousin, whom it belongs to, has men and arms within\r\nit. The young ladies are as safe there as in Kirkwall; and much good may\r\narise from an early communication between Magnus Troil and his\r\ndaughters. And happy am I to see, that in your case, my good old\r\nfriend,--as glorious John says,--\r\n\r\n    ----'After much debate,\r\n  The man prevails above the magistrate.'\"\r\n\r\nThe Provost smiled, nodded his head, and indicated, as far as he thought\r\nhe could do so with decency, how happy he should be if the Fortune's\r\nFavourite, and her disorderly crew, would leave Orkney without further\r\ninterference, or violence on either side. He could not authorize their\r\nbeing supplied from the shore, he said; but, either for fear or favour,\r\nthey were certain to get provisions at Stromness. This pacific\r\nmagistrate then took leave of Halcro and the two ladies, who proposed\r\nthe next morning, to transfer their residence to the House of Stennis,\r\nsituated upon the banks of the salt-water lake of the same name, and\r\nabout four miles by water from the Road of Stromness, where the Rover's\r\nvessel was lying.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n  Fly, Fleance, fly!--Thou mayst escape.\r\n\r\n                                                  _Macbeth._\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was one branch of the various arts by which Norna endeavoured to\r\nmaintain her pretensions to supernatural powers, that she made herself\r\nfamiliarly and practically acquainted with all the secret passes and\r\nrecesses, whether natural or artificial, which she could hear of,\r\nwhether by tradition or otherwise, and was, by such knowledge, often\r\nenabled to perform feats which were otherwise unaccountable. Thus, when\r\nshe escaped from the tabernacle at Burgh-Westra, it was by a sliding\r\nboard which covered a secret passage in the wall, known to none but\r\nherself and Magnus, who, she was well assured, would not betray her. The\r\nprofusion, also, with which she lavished a considerable income,\r\notherwise of no use to her, enabled her to procure the earliest\r\nintelligence respecting whatever she desired to know, and, at the same\r\ntime, to secure all other assistance necessary to carry her plans into\r\neffect. Cleveland, upon the present occasion, had reason to admire both\r\nher sagacity and her resources.\r\n\r\nUpon her applying a little forcible pressure, a door which was concealed\r\nunder some rich wooden sculpture in the screen which divides the eastern\r\naisle from the rest of the Cathedral, opened, and disclosed a dark\r\nnarrow winding passage, into which she entered, telling Cleveland, in a\r\nwhisper, to follow, and be sure he shut the door behind him. He obeyed,\r\nand followed her in darkness and silence, sometimes descending steps, of\r\nthe number of which she always apprized him, sometimes ascending, and\r\noften turning at short angles. The air was more free than he could have\r\nexpected, the passage being ventilated at different parts by unseen and\r\ningeniously contrived spiracles, which communicated with the open air.\r\nAt length their long course ended, by Norna drawing aside a sliding\r\npanel, which, opening behind a wooden, or box-bed, as it is called in\r\nScotland, admitted them into an ancient, but very mean apartment, having\r\na latticed window, and a groined roof. The furniture was much\r\ndilapidated; and its only ornaments were, on the one side of the wall, a\r\ngarland of faded ribbons, such as are used to decorate whale-vessels;\r\nand, on the other, an escutcheon, bearing an Earl's arms and coronet,\r\nsurrounded with the usual emblems of mortality. The mattock and spade,\r\nwhich lay in one corner, together with the appearance of an old man,\r\nwho, in a rusty black coat, and slouched hat, sat reading by a table,\r\nannounced that they were in the habitation of the church-beadle, or\r\nsexton, and in the presence of that respectable functionary.\r\n\r\nWhen his attention was attracted by the noise of the sliding panel, he\r\narose, and, testifying much respect, but no surprise, took his shadowy\r\nhat from his thin grey locks, and stood uncovered in the presence of\r\nNorna with an air of profound humility.\r\n\r\n\"Be faithful,\" said Norna to the old man, \"and beware you show not any\r\nliving mortal the secret path to the Sanctuary.\"\r\n\r\nThe old man bowed, in token of obedience and of thanks, for she put\r\nmoney in his hand as she spoke. With a faltering voice, he expressed his\r\nhope that she would remember his son, who was on the Greenland voyage,\r\nthat he might return fortunate and safe, as he had done last year, when\r\nhe brought back the garland, pointing to that upon the wall.\r\n\r\n\"My cauldron shall boil, and my rhyme shall be said, in his behalf,\"\r\nanswered Norna. \"Waits Pacolet without with the horses?\"\r\n\r\nThe old Sexton assented, and the Pythoness, commanding Cleveland to\r\nfollow her, went through a back door of the apartment into a small\r\ngarden, corresponding, in its desolate appearance, to the habitation\r\nthey had just quitted. The low and broken wall easily permitted them to\r\npass into another and larger garden, though not much better kept, and a\r\ngate, which was upon the latch, let them into a long and winding lane,\r\nthrough which, Norna having whispered to her companion that it was the\r\nonly dangerous place on their road, they walked with a hasty pace. It\r\nwas now nearly dark, and the inhabitants of the poor dwellings, on\r\neither hand, had betaken themselves to their houses. They saw only one\r\nwoman, who was looking from her door, but blessed herself, and retired\r\ninto her house with precipitation, when she saw the tall figure of Norna\r\nstalk past her with long strides. The lane conducted them into the\r\ncountry, where the dumb dwarf waited with three horses, ensconced behind\r\nthe wall of a deserted shed. On one of these Norna instantly seated\r\nherself, Cleveland mounted another, and, followed by Pacolet on the\r\nthird, they moved sharply on through the darkness; the active and\r\nspirited animals on which they rode being of a breed rather taller than\r\nthose reared in Zetland.\r\n\r\nAfter more than an hour's smart riding, in which Norna acted as guide,\r\nthey stopped before a hovel, so utterly desolate in appearance, that it\r\nresembled rather a cattle-shed than a cottage.\r\n\r\n\"Here you must remain till dawn, when your signal can be seen from your\r\nvessel,\" said Norna, consigning the horses to the care of Pacolet, and\r\nleading the way into the wretched hovel, which she presently illuminated\r\nby lighting the small iron lamp which she usually carried along with\r\nher. \"It is a poor,\" she said, \"but a safe place of refuge; for were we\r\npursued hither, the earth would yawn and admit us into its recesses ere\r\nyou were taken. For know, that this ground is sacred to the Gods of old\r\nValhalla.--And now say, man of mischief and of blood, are you friend or\r\nfoe to Norna, the sole priestess of these disowned deities?\"\r\n\r\n\"How is it possible for me to be your enemy?\" said Cleveland.--\"Common\r\ngratitude\"----\r\n\r\n\"Common gratitude,\" said Norna, interrupting him, \"is a common word--and\r\nwords are the common pay which fools accept at the hands of knaves; but\r\nNorna must be requited by actions--by sacrifices.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, mother, name your request.\"\r\n\r\n\"That you never seek to see Minna Troil again, and that you leave this\r\ncoast in twenty-four hours,\" answered Norna.\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible,\" said the outlaw; \"I cannot be soon enough found in\r\nthe sea-stores which the sloop must have.\"\r\n\r\n\"You can. I will take care you are fully supplied; and Caithness and the\r\nHebrides are not far distant--you can depart if you will.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why should I,\" said Cleveland, \"if I will not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because your stay endangers others,\" said Norna, \"and will prove your\r\nown destruction. Hear me with attention. From the first moment I saw you\r\nlying senseless on the sand beneath the cliffs of Sumburgh, I read that\r\nin your countenance which linked you with me, and those who were dear to\r\nme; but whether for good or evil, was hidden from mine eyes. I aided in\r\nsaving your life, in preserving your property. I aided in doing so, the\r\nvery youth whom you have crossed in his dearest affections--crossed by\r\ntale-bearing and slander.\"\r\n\r\n\"_I_ slander Mertoun!\" exclaimed Cleveland. \"By heaven, I scarce\r\nmentioned his name at Burgh-Westra, if it is that which you mean. The\r\npeddling fellow Bryce, meaning, I believe, to be my friend, because he\r\nfound something could be made by me, did, I have since heard, carry\r\ntattle, or truth, I know not which, to the old man, which was confirmed\r\nby the report of the whole island. But, for me, I scarce thought of him\r\nas a rival; else, I had taken a more honourable way to rid myself of\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"Was the point of your double-edged knife, directed to the bosom of an\r\nunarmed man, intended to carve out that more honourable way?\" said\r\nNorna, sternly.\r\n\r\nCleveland was conscience-struck, and remained silent for an instant, ere\r\nhe replied, \"There, indeed, I was wrong; but he is, I thank Heaven,\r\nrecovered, and welcome to an honourable satisfaction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cleveland,\" said the Pythoness, \"No! The fiend who employs you as his\r\nimplement is powerful; but with me he shall not strive. You are of that\r\ntemperament which the dark Influences desire as the tools of their\r\nagency; bold, haughty, and undaunted, unrestrained by principle, and\r\nhaving only in its room a wild sense of indomitable pride, which such\r\nmen call honour. Such you are, and as such your course through life has\r\nbeen--onward and unrestrained, bloody and tempestuous. By me, however,\r\nit shall be controlled,\" she concluded, stretching out her staff, as if\r\nin the attitude of determined authority--\"ay, even although the demon\r\nwho presides over it should now arise in his terrors.\"\r\n\r\nCleveland laughed scornfully. \"Good mother,\" he said, \"reserve such\r\nlanguage for the rude sailor that implores you to bestow him fair wind,\r\nor the poor fisherman that asks success to his nets and lines. I have\r\nbeen long inaccessible both to fear and to superstition. Call forth your\r\ndemon, if you command one, and place him before me. The man that has\r\nspent years in company with incarnate devils, can scarce dread the\r\npresence of a disembodied fiend.\"\r\n\r\nThis was said with a careless and desperate bitterness of spirit, which\r\nproved too powerfully energetic even for the delusions of Norna's\r\ninsanity; and it was with a hollow and tremulous voice that she asked\r\nCleveland--\"For what, then, do you hold me, if you deny the power I have\r\nbought so dearly?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have wisdom, mother,\" said Cleveland; \"at least you have art, and\r\nart is power. I hold you for one who knows how to steer upon the current\r\nof events, but I deny your power to change its course. Do not,\r\ntherefore, waste words in quoting terrors for which I have no feeling,\r\nbut tell me at once, wherefore you would have me depart?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because I will have you see Minna no more,\" answered Norna--\"Because\r\nMinna is the destined bride of him whom men call Mordaunt\r\nMertoun--Because if you depart not within twenty-four hours, utter\r\ndestruction awaits you. In these plain words there is no metaphysical\r\ndelusion--Answer me as plainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"In as plain words, then,\" answered Cleveland, \"I will _not_ leave these\r\nislands--not, at least, till I have seen Minna Troil; and never shall\r\nyour Mordaunt possess her while I live.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear him!\" said Norna--\"hear a mortal man spurn at the means of\r\nprolonging his life!--hear a sinful--a most sinful being, refuse the\r\ntime which fate yet affords for repentance, and for the salvation of an\r\nimmortal soul!--Behold him how he stands erect, bold and confident in\r\nhis youthful strength and courage! My eyes, unused to tears--even my\r\neyes, which have so little cause to weep for him, are blinded with\r\nsorrow, to think what so fair a form will be ere the second sun set!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mother,\" said Cleveland, firmly, yet with some touch of sorrow in his\r\nvoice, \"I in part understand your threats. You know more than we do of\r\nthe course of the Halcyon--perhaps have the means (for I acknowledge you\r\nhave shown wonderful skill of combination in such affairs) of directing\r\nher cruise our way. Be it so,--I will not depart from my purpose for\r\nthat risk. If the frigate comes hither, we have still our shoal water to\r\ntrust to; and I think they will scarce cut us out with boats, as if we\r\nwere a Spanish xebeck. I am therefore resolved I will hoist once more\r\nthe flag under which I have cruised, avail ourselves of the thousand\r\nchances which have helped us in greater odds, and, at the worst, fight\r\nthe vessel to the very last; and, when mortal man can do no more, it is\r\nbut snapping a pistol in the powder-room, and, as we have lived, so\r\nwill we die.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a dead pause as Cleveland ended; and it was broken by his\r\nresuming, in a softer tone--\"You have heard my answer, mother; let us\r\ndebate it no further, but part in peace. I would willingly leave you a\r\nremembrance, that you may not forget a poor fellow to whom your services\r\nhave been useful, and who parts with you in no unkindness, however\r\nunfriendly you are to his dearest interests.--Nay, do not shun to accept\r\nsuch a trifle,\" he said, forcing upon Norna the little silver enchased\r\nbox which had been once the subject of strife betwixt Mertoun and him;\r\n\"it is not for the sake of the metal, which I know you value not, but\r\nsimply as a memorial that you have met him of whom many a strange tale\r\nwill hereafter be told in the seas which he has traversed.\"\r\n\r\n\"I accept your gift,\" said Norna, \"in token that, if I have in aught\r\nbeen accessary to your fate, it was as the involuntary and grieving\r\nagent of other powers. Well did you say we direct not the current of the\r\nevents which hurry us forward, and render our utmost efforts unavailing;\r\neven as the wells of Tuftiloe[39] can wheel the stoutest vessel round\r\nand round, in despite of either sail or steerage.--Pacolet!\" she\r\nexclaimed, in a louder voice, \"what, ho! Pacolet!\"\r\n\r\nA large stone, which lay at the side of the wall of the hovel, fell as\r\nshe spoke, and to Cleveland's surprise, if not somewhat to his fear, the\r\nmisshapen form of the dwarf was seen, like some overgrown reptile,\r\nextricating himself out of a subterranean passage, the entrance to which\r\nthe stone had covered.\r\n\r\nNorna, as if impressed by what Cleveland had said on the subject of her\r\nsupernatural pretensions, was so far from endeavouring to avail herself\r\nof this opportunity to enforce them, that she hastened to explain the\r\nphenomenon he had witnessed.\r\n\r\n\"Such passages,\" she said, \"to which the entrances are carefully\r\nconcealed, are frequently found in these islands--the places of retreat\r\nof the ancient inhabitants, where they sought refuge from the rage of\r\nthe Normans, the pirates of that day. It was that you might avail\r\nyourself of this, in case of need, that I brought you hither. Should you\r\nobserve signs of pursuit, you may either lurk in the bowels of the earth\r\nuntil it has passed by, or escape, if you will, through the farther\r\nentrance near the lake, by which Pacolet entered but now.--And now\r\nfarewell! Think on what I have said; for as sure as you now move and\r\nbreathe a living man, so surely is your doom fixed and sealed, unless,\r\nwithin four-and-twenty hours, you have doubled the Burgh-head.\"\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, mother!\" said Cleveland, as she departed, bending a look upon\r\nhim, in which, as he could perceive by the lamp, sorrow was mingled with\r\ndispleasure.\r\n\r\nThe interview, which thus concluded, left a strong effect even upon the\r\nmind of Cleveland, accustomed as he was to imminent dangers and to\r\nhair-breadth escapes. He in vain attempted to shake off the impression\r\nleft by the words of Norna, which he felt the more powerful, because\r\nthey were in a great measure divested of her wonted mystical tone, which\r\nhe contemned. A thousand times he regretted that he had from time to\r\ntime delayed the resolution, which he had long adopted, to quit his\r\ndreadful and dangerous trade; and as often he firmly determined, that,\r\ncould he but see Minna Troil once more, were it but for a last farewell,\r\nhe would leave the sloop, as soon as his comrades were extricated from\r\ntheir perilous situation, endeavour to obtain the benefit of the King's\r\npardon, and distinguish himself, if possible, in some more honourable\r\ncourse of warfare.\r\n\r\nThis resolution, to which he again and again pledged himself, had at\r\nlength a sedative effect on his mental perturbation, and, wrapt in his\r\ncloak, he enjoyed, for a time, that imperfect repose which exhausted\r\nnature demands as her tribute, even from those who are situated on the\r\nverge of the most imminent danger. But how far soever the guilty may\r\nsatisfy his own mind, and stupify the feelings of remorse, by such a\r\nconditional repentance, we may well question whether it is not, in the\r\nsight of Heaven, rather a presumptuous aggravation, than an expiation of\r\nhis sins.\r\n\r\nWhen Cleveland awoke, the grey dawn was already mingling with the\r\ntwilight of an Orcadian night. He found himself on the verge of a\r\nbeautiful sheet of water, which, close by the place where he had rested,\r\nwas nearly divided by two tongues of land that approach each other from\r\nthe opposing sides of the lake, and are in some degree united by the\r\nBridge of Broisgar, a long causeway, containing openings to permit the\r\nflow and reflux of the tide. Behind him, and fronting to the bridge,\r\nstood that remarkable semicircle of huge upright stones, which has no\r\nrival in Britain, excepting the inimitable monument at Stonehenge. These\r\nimmense blocks of stone, all of them above twelve feet, and several\r\nbeing even fourteen or fifteen feet in height, stood around the pirate\r\nin the grey light of the dawning, like the phantom forms of antediluvian\r\ngiants, who, shrouded in the habiliments of the dead, came to revisit,\r\nby this pale light, the earth which they had plagued by their oppression\r\nand polluted by their sins, till they brought down upon it the vengeance\r\nof long-suffering Heaven.[40]\r\n\r\nCleveland was less interested by this singular monument of antiquity\r\nthan by the distant view of Stromness, which he could as yet scarce\r\ndiscover. He lost no time in striking a light, by the assistance of one\r\nof his pistols, and some wet fern supplied him with fuel sufficient to\r\nmake the appointed signal. It had been earnestly watched for on board\r\nthe sloop; for Goffe's incapacity became daily more apparent; and even\r\nhis most steady adherents agreed it would be best to submit to\r\nCleveland's command till they got back to the West Indies.\r\n\r\nBunce, who came with the boat to bring off his favourite commander,\r\ndanced, cursed, shouted, and spouted for joy, when he saw him once more\r\nat freedom. \"They had already,\" he said, \"made some progress in\r\nvictualling the sloop, and they might have made more, but for that\r\ndrunken old swab Goffe, who minded nothing but splicing the main-brace.\"\r\n\r\nThe boat's crew were inspired with the same enthusiasm, and rowed so\r\nhard, that, although the tide was against them, and the air or wind\r\nfailed, they soon placed Cleveland once more on the quarter-deck of the\r\nvessel which it was his misfortune to command.\r\n\r\nThe first exercise of the Captain's power was to make known to Magnus\r\nTroil that he was at full freedom to depart--that he was willing to make\r\nhim any compensation in his power, for the interruption of his voyage to\r\nKirkwall; and that Captain Cleveland was desirous, if agreeable to Mr.\r\nTroil, to pay his respects to him on board his brig--thank him for\r\nformer favours, and apologize for the circumstances attending his\r\ndetention.\r\n\r\nTo Bunce, who, as the most civilized of the crew, Cleveland had\r\nintrusted this message, the old plain-dealing Udaller made the following\r\nanswer: \"Tell your Captain that I should be glad to think he had never\r\nstopped any one upon the high sea, save such as have suffered as little\r\nas I have. Say, too, that if we are to continue friends, we shall be\r\nmost so at a distance; for I like the sound of his cannon-balls as\r\nlittle by sea, as he would like the whistle of a bullet by land from my\r\nrifle-gun. Say, in a word, that I am sorry I was mistaken in him, and\r\nthat he would have done better to have reserved for the Spaniard the\r\nusage he is bestowing on his countrymen.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so that is your message, old Snapcholerick?\" said Bunce--\"Now, stap\r\nmy vitals if I have not a mind to do your errand for you over the left\r\nshoulder, and teach you more respect for gentlemen of fortune! But I\r\nwon't, and chiefly for the sake of your two pretty wenches, not to\r\nmention my old friend Claud Halcro, the very visage of whom brought back\r\nall the old days of scene-shifting and candle-snuffing. So good morrow\r\nto you, Gaffer Seal's-cap, and all is said that need pass between us.\"\r\n\r\nNo sooner did the boat put off with the pirates, who left the brig, and\r\nnow returned to their own vessel, than Magnus, in order to avoid\r\nreposing unnecessary confidence in the honour of these gentlemen of\r\nfortune, as they called themselves, got his brig under way; and, the\r\nwind coming favourably round, and increasing as the sun rose, he crowded\r\nall sail for Scalpa-flow, intending there to disembark and go by land to\r\nKirkwall, where he expected to meet his daughters and his friend Claud\r\nHalcro.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[39] A _well_, in the language of those seas, denotes one of the\r\nwhirlpools, or circular eddies, which wheel and boil with astonishing\r\nstrength, and are very dangerous. Hence the distinction, in old English,\r\nbetwixt _wells_ and _waves_, the latter signifying the direct onward\r\ncourse of the tide, and the former the smooth, glassy, oily-looking\r\nwhirlpools, whose strength seems to the eye almost irresistible.\r\n\r\n[40] Note VII.--The Standing Stones of Stennis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n  Now, Emma, now the last reflection make,\r\n  What thou wouldst follow, what thou must forsake\r\n  By our ill-omen'd stars and adverse Heaven,\r\n  No middle object to thy choice is given.\r\n\r\n                                           _Henry and Emma._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sun was high in heaven; the boats were busily fetching off from the\r\nshore the promised supply of provisions and water, which, as many\r\nfishing skiffs were employed in the service, were got on board with\r\nunexpected speed, and stowed away by the crew of the sloop, with equal\r\ndispatch. All worked with good will; for all, save Cleveland himself,\r\nwere weary of a coast, where every moment increased their danger, and\r\nwhere, which they esteemed a worse misfortune, there was no booty to be\r\nwon. Bunce and Derrick took the immediate direction of this duty, while\r\nCleveland, walking the deck alone, and in silence, only interfered from\r\ntime to time, to give some order which circumstances required, and then\r\nrelapsed into his own sad reflections.\r\n\r\nThere are two sorts of men whom situations of guilt, terror, and\r\ncommotion, bring forward as prominent agents. The first are spirits so\r\nnaturally moulded and fitted for deeds of horror, that they stalk forth\r\nfrom their lurking-places like actual demons, to work in their native\r\nelement, as the hideous apparition of the Bearded Man came forth at\r\nVersailles, on the memorable 5th October, 1789, the delighted\r\nexecutioner of the victims delivered up to him by a bloodthirsty rabble.\r\nBut Cleveland belonged to the second class of these unfortunate beings,\r\nwho are involved in evil rather by the concurrence of external\r\ncircumstances than by natural inclination, being, indeed, one in whom\r\nhis first engaging in this lawless mode of life, as the follower of his\r\nfather, nay, perhaps, even his pursuing it as his father's avenger,\r\ncarried with it something of mitigation and apology;--one also who often\r\nconsidered his guilty situation with horror, and had made repeated,\r\nthough ineffectual efforts, to escape from it.\r\n\r\nSuch thoughts of remorse were now rolling in his mind, and he may be\r\nforgiven, if recollections of Minna mingled with and aided them. He\r\nlooked around, too, on his mates, and, profligate and hardened as he\r\nknew them to be, he could not think of their paying the penalty of his\r\nobstinacy. \"We shall be ready to sail with the ebb tide,\" he said to\r\nhimself--\"why should I endanger these men, by detaining them till the\r\nhour of danger, predicted by that singular woman, shall arrive? Her\r\nintelligence, howsoever acquired, has been always strangely accurate;\r\nand her warning was as solemn as if a mother were to apprize an erring\r\nson of his crimes, and of his approaching punishment. Besides, what\r\nchance is there that I can again see Minna? She is at Kirkwall,\r\ndoubtless, and to hold my course thither would be to steer right upon\r\nthe rocks. No, I will not endanger these poor fellows--I will sail with\r\nthe ebb tide. On the desolate Hebrides, or on the north-west coast of\r\nIreland, I will leave the vessel, and return hither in some\r\ndisguise--yet why should I return, since it will perhaps be only to see\r\nMinna the bride of Mordaunt? No--let the vessel sail with this ebb tide\r\nwithout me. I will abide and take my fate.\"\r\n\r\nHis meditations were here interrupted by Jack Bunce, who, hailing him\r\nnoble Captain, said they were ready to sail when he pleased.\r\n\r\n\"When _you_ please, Bunce; for I shall leave the command with you, and\r\ngo ashore at Stromness,\" said Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\"You shall do no such matter, by Heaven!\" answered Bunce. \"The command\r\nwith me, truly! and how the devil am I to get the crew to obey _me_?\r\nWhy, even Dick Fletcher rides rusty on me now and then. You know well\r\nenough that, without you, we shall be all at each other's throats in\r\nhalf an hour; and, if you desert us, what a rope's end does it signify\r\nwhether we are destroyed by the king's cruisers, or by each other? Come,\r\ncome, noble Captain, there are black-eyed girls enough in the world, but\r\nwhere will you find so tight a sea-boat as the little Favourite here,\r\nmanned as she is with a set of tearing lads,\r\n\r\n  'Fit to disturb the peace of all the world,\r\n  And rule it when 'tis wildest?'\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a precious fool, Jack Bunce,\" said Cleveland, half angry, and,\r\nin despite of himself, half diverted, by the false tones and exaggerated\r\ngesture of the stage-struck pirate.\r\n\r\n\"It may be so, noble Captain,\" answered Bunce, \"and it may be that I\r\nhave my comrades in my folly. Here are you, now, going to play All for\r\nLove, and the World well Lost, and yet you cannot bear a harmless\r\nbounce in blank verse--Well, I can talk prose for the matter, for I have\r\nnews enough to tell--and strange news, too--ay, and stirring news to\r\nboot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, prithee deliver them (to speak thy own cant) like a man of this\r\nworld.\"\r\n\r\n\"The Stromness fishers will accept nothing for their provisions and\r\ntrouble,\" said Bunce--\"there is a wonder for you!\"\r\n\r\n\"And for what reason, I pray?\" said Cleveland; \"it is the first time I\r\nhave ever heard of cash being refused at a seaport.\"\r\n\r\n\"True--they commonly lay the charges on as thick as if they were\r\ncaulking. But here is the matter. The owner of the brig yonder, the\r\nfather of your fair Imoinda, stands paymaster, by way of thanks for the\r\ncivility with which we treated his daughters, and that we may not meet\r\nour due, as he calls it, on these shores.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is like the frank-hearted old Udaller!\" said Cleveland; \"but is he\r\nat Stromness? I thought he was to have crossed the island for Kirkwall.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did so purpose,\" said Bunce; \"but more folks than King Duncan change\r\nthe course of their voyage. He was no sooner ashore than he was met with\r\nby a meddling old witch of these parts, who has her finger in every\r\nman's pie, and by her counsel he changed his purpose of going to\r\nKirkwall, and lies at anchor for the present in yonder white house, that\r\nyou may see with your glass up the lake yonder. I am told the old woman\r\nclubbed also to pay for the sloop's stores. Why she should shell out the\r\nboards I cannot conceive an idea, except that she is said to be a witch,\r\nand may befriend us as so many devils.\"\r\n\r\n\"But who told you all this?\" said Cleveland, without using his\r\nspy-glass, or seeming so much interested in the news as his comrade had\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" replied Bunce, \"I made a trip ashore this morning to the village,\r\nand had a can with an old acquaintance, who had been sent by Master\r\nTroil to look after matters, and I fished it all out of him, and more,\r\ntoo, than I am desirous of telling you, noble Captain.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who is your intelligencer?\" said Cleveland; \"has he got no name?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, he is an old, fiddling, foppish acquaintance of mine, called\r\nHalcro, if you must know,\" said Bunce.\r\n\r\n\"Halcro!\" echoed Cleveland, his eyes sparkling with surprise--\"Claud\r\nHalcro?--why, he went ashore at Inganess with Minna and her\r\nsister--Where are they?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that is just what I did not want to tell you,\" replied the\r\nconfidant--\"yet hang me if I can help it, for I cannot baulk a fine\r\nsituation.--That start had a fine effect--O ay, and the spy-glass is\r\nturned on the House of Stennis _now_!--Well, yonder they are, it must be\r\nconfessed--indifferently well guarded, too. Some of the old witch's\r\npeople are come over from that mountain of an island--Hoy, as they call\r\nit; and the old gentleman has got some fellows under arms himself. But\r\nwhat of all that, noble Captain!--give you but the word, and we snap up\r\nthe wenches to-night--clap them under hatches--man the capstern by\r\ndaybreak--up topsails--and sail with the morning tide.\"\r\n\r\n\"You sicken me with your villainy,\" said Cleveland, turning away from\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Umph!--villainy, and sicken you!\" said Bunce--\"Now, pray, what have I\r\nsaid but what has been done a thousand times by gentlemen of fortune\r\nlike ourselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mention it not again,\" said Cleveland; then took a turn along the deck,\r\nin deep meditation, and, coming back to Bunce, took him by the hand, and\r\nsaid, \"Jack, I will see her once more.\"\r\n\r\n\"With all my heart,\" said Bunce, sullenly.\r\n\r\n\"Once more will I see her, and it may be to abjure at her feet this\r\ncursed trade, and expiate my offences\"----\r\n\r\n\"At the gallows!\" said Bunce, completing the sentence--\"With all my\r\nheart!--confess and be hanged is a most reverend proverb.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay--but, dear Jack!\" said Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\"Dear Jack!\" answered Bunce, in the same sullen tone--\"a dear sight you\r\nhave been to dear Jack. But hold your own course--I have done with\r\ncaring for you for ever--I should but sicken you with my villainous\r\ncounsels.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, must I soothe this silly fellow as if he were a spoiled child,\"\r\nsaid Cleveland, speaking at Bunce, but not to him; \"and yet he has sense\r\nenough, and bravery enough, too; and, one would think, kindness enough\r\nto know that men don't pick their words during a gale of wind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that's true, Clement,\" said Bunce, \"and there is my hand upon\r\nit--And, now I think upon't, you shall have your last interview, for\r\nit's out of my line to prevent a parting scene; and what signifies a\r\ntide--we can sail by to-morrow's ebb as well as by this.\"\r\n\r\nCleveland sighed, for Norna's prediction rushed on his mind; but the\r\nopportunity of a last meeting with Minna was too tempting to be\r\nresigned either for presentiment or prediction.\r\n\r\n\"I will go presently ashore to the place where they all are,\" said\r\nBunce; \"and the payment of these stores shall serve me for a pretext;\r\nand I will carry any letters or message from you to Minna with the\r\ndexterity of a valet de chambre.\"\r\n\r\n\"But they have armed men--you may be in danger,\" said Cleveland.\r\n\r\n\"Not a whit--not a whit,\" replied Bunce. \"I protected the wenches when\r\nthey were in my power; I warrant their father will neither wrong me, nor\r\nsee me wronged.\"\r\n\r\n\"You say true,\" said Cleveland, \"it is not in his nature. I will\r\ninstantly write a note to Minna.\" And he ran down to the cabin for that\r\npurpose, where he wasted much paper, ere, with a trembling hand, and\r\nthrobbing heart, he achieved such a letter as he hoped might prevail on\r\nMinna to permit him a farewell meeting on the succeeding morning.\r\n\r\nHis adherent, Bunce, in the meanwhile, sought out Fletcher, of whose\r\nsupport to second any motion whatever, he accounted himself perfectly\r\nsure; and, followed by this trusty satellite, he intruded himself on the\r\nawful presence of Hawkins the boatswain, and Derrick the quarter-master,\r\nwho were regaling themselves with a can of rumbo, after the fatiguing\r\nduty of the day.\r\n\r\n\"Here comes he can tell us,\" said Derrick.--\"So, Master Lieutenant, for\r\nso we must call you now, I think, let us have a peep into your\r\ncounsels--When will the anchor be a-trip?\"\r\n\r\n\"When it pleases heaven, Master Quarter-master,\" answered Bunce, \"for I\r\nknow no more than the stern-post.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, d----n my buttons,\" said Derrick, \"do we not weigh this tide?\"\r\n\r\n\"Or to-morrow's tide, at farthest?\" said the Boatswain--\"Why, what have\r\nwe been slaving the whole company for, to get all these stores aboard?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said Bunce, \"you are to know that Cupid has laid our\r\nCaptain on board, carried the vessel, and nailed down his wits under\r\nhatches.\"\r\n\r\n\"What sort of play-stuff is all this?\" said the Boatswain, gruffly. \"If\r\nyou have any thing to tell us, say it in a word, like a man.\"\r\n\r\n\"Howsomdever,\" said Fletcher, \"I always think Jack Bunce speaks like a\r\nman, and acts like a man too--and so, d'ye see\"----\r\n\r\n\"Hold your peace, dear Dick, best of bullybacks, be silent,\" said\r\nBunce--\"Gentlemen, in one word, the Captain is in love.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, now, only think of that!\" said the Boatswain; \"not but that I have\r\nbeen in love as often as any man, when the ship was laid up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, but,\" continued Bunce, \"Captain Cleveland is in love--Yes--Prince\r\nVolscius is in love; and, though that's the cue for laughing on the\r\nstage, it is no laughing matter here. He expects to meet the girl\r\nto-morrow, for the last time; and that, we all know, leads to another\r\nmeeting, and another, and so on till the Halcyon is down on us, and then\r\nwe may look for more kicks than halfpence.\"\r\n\r\n\"By --,\" said the Boatswain, with a sounding oath, \"we'll have a mutiny,\r\nand not allow him to go ashore,--eh, Derrick?\"\r\n\r\n\"And the best way, too,\" said Derrick.\r\n\r\n\"What d'ye think of it, Jack Bunce?\" said Fletcher, in whose ears this\r\ncounsel sounded very sagely, but who still bent a wistful look upon his\r\ncompanion.\r\n\r\n\"Why, look ye, gentlemen,\" said Bunce, \"I will mutiny none, and stap my\r\nvitals if any of you shall!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then I won't, for one,\" said Fletcher; \"but what are we to do,\r\nsince howsomdever\"----\r\n\r\n\"Stopper your jaw, Dick, will you?\" said Bunce.--\"Now, Boatswain, I am\r\npartly of your mind, that the Captain must be brought to reason by a\r\nlittle wholesome force. But you all know he has the spirit of a lion,\r\nand will do nothing unless he is allowed to hold on his own course.\r\nWell, I'll go ashore and make this appointment. The girl comes to the\r\nrendezvous in the morning, and the Captain goes ashore--we take a good\r\nboat's crew with us, to row against tide and current, and we will be\r\nready at the signal, to jump ashore and bring off the Captain and the\r\ngirl, whether they will or no. The pet-child will not quarrel with us,\r\nsince we bring off his whirligig along with him; and if he is still\r\nfractious, why, we will weigh anchor without his orders, and let him\r\ncome to his senses at leisure, and know his friends another time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, this has a face with it, Master Derrick,\" said Hawkins.\r\n\r\n\"Jack Bunce is always right,\" said Fletcher; \"howsomdever, the Captain\r\nwill shoot some of us, that is certain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold your jaw, Dick,\" said Bunce; \"pray, who the devil cares, do you\r\nthink, whether you are shot or hanged?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, it don't much argufy for the matter of that,\" replied Dick;\r\n\"howsomdever\"----\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet, I tell you,\" said his inexorable patron, \"and hear me\r\nout.--We will take him at unawares, so that he shall neither have time\r\nto use cutlass nor pops; and I myself, for the dear love I bear him,\r\nwill be the first to lay him on his back. There is a nice tight-going\r\nbit of a pinnace, that is a consort of this chase of the Captain's,--if\r\nI have an opportunity, I'll snap her up on my own account.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes,\" said Derrick, \"let you alone for keeping on the look-out for\r\nyour own comforts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Faith, nay,\" said Bunce, \"I only snatch at them when they come fairly\r\nin my way, or are purchased by dint of my own wit; and none of you could\r\nhave fallen on such a plan as this. We shall have the Captain with us,\r\nhead, hand, and heart and all, besides making a scene fit to finish a\r\ncomedy. So I will go ashore to make the appointment, and do you possess\r\nsome of the gentlemen who are still sober, and fit to be trusted, with\r\nthe knowledge of our intentions.\"\r\n\r\nBunce, with his friend Fletcher, departed accordingly, and the two\r\nveteran pirates remained looking at each other in silence, until the\r\nBoatswain spoke at last. \"Blow me, Derrick, if I like these two\r\ndaffadandilly young fellows; they are not the true breed. Why, they are\r\nno more like the rovers I have known, than this sloop is to a\r\nfirst-rate. Why, there was old Sharpe that read prayers to his ship's\r\ncompany every Sunday, what would he have said to have heard it proposed\r\nto bring two wenches on board?\"\r\n\r\n\"And what would tough old Black Beard have said,\" answered his\r\ncompanion, \"if they had expected to keep them to themselves? They\r\ndeserve to be made to walk the plank for their impudence; or to be tied\r\nback to back and set a-diving, and I care not how soon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay, but who is to command the ship, then?\" said Hawkins.\r\n\r\n\"Why, what ails you at old Goffe?\" answered Derrick.\r\n\r\n\"Why, he has sucked the monkey so long and so often,\" said the\r\nBoatswain, \"that the best of him is buffed. He is little better than an\r\nold woman when he is sober, and he is roaring mad when he is drunk--we\r\nhave had enough of Goffe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, then, what d'ye say to yourself, or to me, Boatswain?\" demanded\r\nthe Quarter-master. \"I am content to toss up for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rot it, no,\" answered the Boatswain, after a moment's consideration;\r\n\"if we were within reach of the trade-winds, we might either of us make\r\na shift; but it will take all Cleveland's navigation to get us there;\r\nand so, I think, there is nothing like Bunce's project for the present.\r\nHark, he calls for the boat--I must go on deck and have her lowered for\r\nhis honour, d----n his eyes.\"\r\n\r\nThe boat was lowered accordingly, made its voyage up the lake with\r\nsafety, and landed Bunce within a few hundred yards of the old\r\nmansion-house of Stennis. Upon arriving in front of the house, he found\r\nthat hasty measures had been taken to put it in a state of defence, the\r\nlower windows being barricaded, with places left for use of musketry,\r\nand a ship-gun being placed so as to command the entrance, which was\r\nbesides guarded by two sentinels. Bunce demanded admission at the gate,\r\nwhich was briefly and unceremoniously refused, with an exhortation to\r\nhim, at the same time, to be gone about his business before worse came\r\nof it. As he continued, however, importunately to insist on seeing some\r\none of the family, and stated his business to be of the most urgent\r\nnature, Claud Halcro at length appeared, and, with more peevishness than\r\nbelonged to his usual manner, that admirer of glorious John expostulated\r\nwith his old acquaintance upon his pertinacious folly.\r\n\r\n\"You are,\" he said, \"like foolish moths fluttering about a candle, which\r\nis sure at last to consume you.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you,\" said Bunce, \"are a set of stingless drones, whom we can smoke\r\nout of your defences at our pleasure, with half-a-dozen of\r\nhand-grenades.\"\r\n\r\n\"Smoke a fool's head!\" said Halcro; \"take my advice, and mind your own\r\nmatters, or there will be those upon you will smoke you to purpose.\r\nEither begone, or tell me in two words what you want; for you are like\r\nto receive no welcome here save from a blunderbuss. We are men enough of\r\nourselves; and here is young Mordaunt Mertoun come from Hoy, whom your\r\nCaptain so nearly murdered.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tush, man,\" said Bunce, \"he did but let out a little malapert blood.\"\r\n\r\n\"We want no such phlebotomy here,\" said Claud Halcro; \"and, besides,\r\nyour patient turns out to be nearer allied to us than either you or we\r\nthought of; so you may think how little welcome the Captain or any of\r\nhis crew are like to be here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well; but what if I bring money for the stores sent on board?\"\r\n\r\n\"Keep it till it is asked of you,\" said Halcro. \"There are two bad\r\npaymasters--he that pays too soon, and he that does not pay at all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, let me at least give our thanks to the donor,\" said Bunce.\r\n\r\n\"Keep them, too, till they are asked for,\" answered the poet.\r\n\r\n\"So this is all the welcome I have of you for old acquaintance' sake?\"\r\nsaid Bunce.\r\n\r\n\"Why, what can I do for you, Master Altamont?\" said Halcro, somewhat\r\nmoved.--\"If young Mordaunt had had his own will, he would have welcomed\r\nyou with 'the red Burgundy, Number a thousand.' For God's sake begone,\r\nelse the stage direction will be, Enter guard, and seize Altamont.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not give you the trouble,\" said Bunce, \"but will make my exit\r\ninstantly.--Stay a moment--I had almost forgot that I have a slip of\r\npaper for the tallest of your girls there--Minna, ay, Minna is her name.\r\nIt is a farewell from Captain Cleveland--you cannot refuse to give it\r\nher?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, poor fellow!\" said Halcro--\"I comprehend--I comprehend--Farewell,\r\nfair Armida--\r\n\r\n  ''Mid pikes and 'mid bullets, 'mid tempests and fire,\r\n  The danger is less than in hopeless desire!'\r\n\r\nTell me but this--is there poetry in it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Chokeful to the seal, with song, sonnet, and elegy,\" answered Bunce;\r\n\"but let her have it cautiously and secretly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tush, man!--teach me to deliver a billet-doux!--me, who have been in\r\nthe Wits' Coffee-house, and have seen all the toasts of the Kit-Cat\r\nClub!--Minna shall have it, then, for old acquaintance' sake, Mr.\r\nAltamont, and for your Captain's sake, too, who has less of the core of\r\ndevil about him than his trade requires. There can be no harm in a\r\nfarewell letter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Farewell, then, old boy, for ever and a day!\" said Bunce; and seizing\r\nthe poet's hand, gave it so hearty a gripe, that he left him roaring,\r\nand shaking his fist, like a dog when a hot cinder has fallen on his\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nLeaving the rover to return on board the vessel, we remain with the\r\nfamily of Magnus Troil, assembled at their kinsman's mansion of Stennis,\r\nwhere they maintained a constant and careful watch against surprise.\r\n\r\nMordaunt Mertoun had been received with much kindness by Magnus Troil,\r\nwhen he came to his assistance, with a small party of Norna's\r\ndependants, placed by her under his command. The Udaller was easily\r\nsatisfied that the reports instilled into his ears by the Jagger,\r\nzealous to augment his favour towards his more profitable customer\r\nCleveland, by diminishing that of Mertoun, were without foundation. They\r\nhad, indeed, been confirmed by the good Lady Glowrowrum, and by common\r\nfame, both of whom were pleased to represent Mordaunt Mertoun as an\r\narrogant pretender to the favour of the sisters of Burgh-Westra, who\r\nonly hesitated, sultan-like, on whom he should bestow the handkerchief.\r\nBut common fame, Magnus considered, was a common liar, and he was\r\nsometimes disposed (where scandal was concerned) to regard the good Lady\r\nGlowrowrum as rather an uncommon specimen of the same genus. He\r\ntherefore received Mordaunt once more into full favour, listened with\r\nmuch surprise to the claim which Norna laid to the young man's duty, and\r\nwith no less interest to her intention of surrendering to him the\r\nconsiderable property which she had inherited from her father. Nay, it\r\nis even probable that, though he gave no immediate answer to her hints\r\nconcerning an union betwixt his eldest daughter and her heir, he might\r\nthink such an alliance recommended, as well by the young man's personal\r\nmerits, as by the chance it gave of reuniting the very large estate\r\nwhich had been divided betwixt his own father and that of Norna. At all\r\nevents, the Udaller received his young friend with much kindness, and he\r\nand the proprietor of the mansion joined in intrusting to him, as the\r\nyoungest and most active of the party, the charge of commanding the\r\nnight-watch, and relieving the sentinels around the House of Stennis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n  Of an outlawe, this is the lawe--\r\n    That men him take and bind,\r\n  Without pitie hang'd to be,\r\n    And waive with the wind.\r\n\r\n                         _The Ballad of the Nut Brown Maid._\r\n\r\n\r\nMordaunt had caused the sentinels who had been on duty since midnight to\r\nbe relieved ere the peep of day, and having given directions that the\r\nguard should be again changed at sunrise, he had retired to a small\r\nparlour, and, placing his arms beside him, was slumbering in an\r\neasy-chair, when he felt himself pulled by the watch-cloak in which he\r\nwas enveloped.\r\n\r\n\"Is it sunrise,\" said he, \"already?\" as, starting up, he discovered the\r\nfirst beams lying level upon the horizon.\r\n\r\n\"Mordaunt!\" said a voice, every note of which thrilled to his heart.\r\n\r\nHe turned his eyes on the speaker, and Brenda Troil, to his joyful\r\nastonishment, stood before him. As he was about to address her eagerly,\r\nhe was checked by observing the signs of sorrow and discomposure in her\r\npale cheeks, trembling lips, and brimful eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Mordaunt,\" she said, \"you must do Minna and me a favour--you must allow\r\nus to leave the house quietly, and without alarming any one, in order to\r\ngo as far as the Standing Stones of Stennis.\"\r\n\r\n\"What freak can this be, dearest Brenda?\" said Mordaunt, much amazed at\r\nthe request--\"some Orcadian observance of superstition, perhaps; but the\r\ntime is too dangerous, and my charge from your father too strict, that I\r\nshould permit you to pass without his consent. Consider, dearest Brenda,\r\nI am a soldier on duty, and must obey orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mordaunt,\" said Brenda, \"this is no jesting matter--Minna's reason,\r\nnay, Minna's life, depends on your giving us this permission.\"\r\n\r\n\"And for what purpose?\" said Mordaunt; \"let me at least know that.\"\r\n\r\n\"For a wild and a desperate purpose,\" replied Brenda--\"It is that she\r\nmay meet Cleveland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cleveland!\" said Mordaunt--\"Should the villain come ashore, he shall be\r\nwelcomed with a shower of rifle-balls. Let me within a hundred yards of\r\nhim,\" he added, grasping his piece, \"and all the mischief he has done me\r\nshall be balanced with an ounce bullet!\"\r\n\r\n\"His death will drive Minna frantic,\" said Brenda; \"and him who injures\r\nMinna, Brenda will never again look upon.\"\r\n\r\n\"This is madness--raving madness!\" said Mordaunt--\"Consider your\r\nhonour--consider your duty.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can consider nothing but Minna's danger,\" said Brenda, breaking into\r\na flood of tears; \"her former illness was nothing to the state she has\r\nbeen in all night. She holds in her hand his letter, written in\r\ncharacters of fire, rather than of ink, imploring her to see him, for a\r\nlast farewell, as she would save a mortal body, and an immortal soul;\r\npledging himself for her safety; and declaring no power shall force him\r\nfrom the coast till he has seen her.--You _must_ let us pass.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is impossible!\" replied Mordaunt, in great perplexity--\"This ruffian\r\nhas imprecations enough, doubtless, at his fingers' ends--but what\r\nbetter pledge has he to offer?--I cannot permit Minna to go.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" said Brenda, somewhat reproachfully, while she dried her\r\ntears, yet still continued sobbing, \"that there is something in what\r\nNorna spoke of betwixt Minna and you; and that you are too jealous of\r\nthis poor wretch, to allow him even to speak with her an instant before\r\nhis departure.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are unjust,\" said Mordaunt, hurt, and yet somewhat flattered by her\r\nsuspicions,--\"you are as unjust as you are imprudent. You know--you\r\ncannot but know--that Minna is chiefly dear to me as _your_ sister. Tell\r\nme, Brenda--and tell me truly--if I aid you in this folly, have you no\r\nsuspicion of the Pirate's faith!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, none,\" said Brenda; \"if I had any, do you think I would urge you\r\nthus? He is wild and unhappy, but I think we may in this trust him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is the appointed place the Standing Stones, and the time daybreak?\"\r\nagain demanded Mordaunt.\r\n\r\n\"It is, and the time is come,\" said Brenda,--\"for Heaven's sake let us\r\ndepart!\"\r\n\r\n\"I will myself,\" said Mordaunt, \"relieve the sentinel at the front door\r\nfor a few minutes, and suffer you to pass.--You will not protract this\r\ninterview, so full of danger?\"\r\n\r\n\"We will not,\" said Brenda; \"and you, on your part, will not avail\r\nyourself of this unhappy man's venturing hither, to harm or to seize\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rely on my honour,\" said Mordaunt--\"He shall have no harm, unless he\r\noffers any.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I go to call my sister,\" said Brenda, and quickly left the\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nMordaunt considered the matter for an instant, and then going to the\r\nsentinel at the front door, he desired him to run instantly to the\r\nmain-guard, and order the whole to turn out with their arms--to see the\r\norder obeyed, and to return when they were in readiness. Meantime, he\r\nhimself, he said, would remain upon the post.\r\n\r\nDuring the interval of the sentinel's absence, the front door was slowly\r\nopened, and Minna and Brenda appeared, muffled in their mantles. The\r\nformer leaned on her sister, and kept her face bent on the ground, as\r\none who felt ashamed of the step she was about to take. Brenda also\r\npassed her lover in silence, but threw back upon him a look of gratitude\r\nand affection, which doubled, if possible, his anxiety for their safety.\r\n\r\nThe sisters, in the meanwhile, passed out of sight of the house; when\r\nMinna, whose step, till that time, had been faint and feeble, began to\r\nerect her person, and to walk with a pace so firm and so swift, that\r\nBrenda, who had some difficulty to keep up with her, could not forbear\r\nremonstrating on the imprudence of hurrying her spirits, and exhausting\r\nher force, by such unnecessary haste.\r\n\r\n\"Fear not, my dearest sister,\" said Minna; \"the spirit which I now feel\r\nwill, and must, sustain me through the dreadful interview. I could not\r\nbut move with a drooping head, and dejected pace, while I was in view of\r\none who must necessarily deem me deserving of his pity, or his scorn.\r\nBut you know, my dearest Brenda, and Mordaunt shall also know, that the\r\nlove I bore to that unhappy man, was as pure as the rays of that sun,\r\nthat is now reflected on the waves. And I dare attest that glorious sun,\r\nand yonder blue heaven, to bear me witness, that, but to urge him to\r\nchange his unhappy course of life, I had not, for all the temptations\r\nthis round world holds, ever consented to see him more.\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke thus, in a tone which afforded much confidence to Brenda,\r\nthe sisters attained the summit of a rising ground, whence they\r\ncommanded a full view of the Orcadian Stonehenge, consisting of a huge\r\ncircle and semicircle of the Standing Stones, as they are called, which\r\nalready glimmered a greyish white in the rising sun, and projected far\r\nto the westward their long gigantic shadows. At another time, the scene\r\nwould have operated powerfully on the imaginative mind of Minna, and\r\ninterested the curiosity at least of her less sensitive sister. But, at\r\nthis moment, neither was at leisure to receive the impressions which\r\nthis stupendous monument of antiquity is so well calculated to impress\r\non the feelings of those who behold it; for they saw, in the lower lake,\r\nbeneath what is termed the Bridge of Broisgar, a boat well manned and\r\narmed, which had disembarked one of its crew, who advanced alone, and\r\nwrapped in a naval cloak, towards that monumental circle which they\r\nthemselves were about to reach from another quarter.\r\n\r\n\"They are many, and they are armed,\" said the startled Brenda, in a\r\nwhisper to her sister.\r\n\r\n\"It is for precaution's sake,\" answered Minna, \"which, alas, their\r\ncondition renders but too necessary. Fear no treachery from him--that,\r\nat least, is not his vice.\"\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, or shortly afterwards, she attained the centre of the\r\ncircle, on which, in the midst of the tall erect pillars of rude stone\r\nthat are raised around, lies one flat and prostrate, supported by short\r\nstone pillars, of which some relics are still visible, that had once\r\nserved, perhaps, the purpose of an altar.\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" she said, \"in heathen times (if we may believe legends, which\r\nhave cost me but too dear) our ancestors offered sacrifices to heathen\r\ndeities--and here will I, from my soul, renounce, abjure, and offer up\r\nto a better and a more merciful God than was known to them, the vain\r\nideas with which my youthful imagination has been seduced.\"\r\n\r\nShe stood by the prostrate table of stone, and saw Cleveland advance\r\ntowards her, with a timid pace, and a downcast look, as different from\r\nhis usual character and bearing, as Minna's high air and lofty\r\ndemeanour, and calm contemplative posture, were distant from those of\r\nthe love-lorn and broken-hearted maiden, whose weight had almost borne\r\ndown the support of her sister as she left the House of Stennis. If the\r\nbelief of those is true, who assign these singular monuments exclusively\r\nto the Druids, Minna might have seemed the Haxa, or high priestess of\r\nthe order, from whom some champion of the tribe expected inauguration.\r\nOr, if we hold the circles of Gothic and Scandinavian origin, she might\r\nhave seemed a descended Vision of Freya, the spouse of the Thundering\r\nDeity, before whom some bold Sea-King or champion bent with an awe,\r\nwhich no mere mortal terror could have inflicted upon him. Brenda,\r\noverwhelmed with inexpressible fear and doubt, remained a pace or two\r\nbehind, anxiously observing the motions of Cleveland, and attending to\r\nnothing around, save to him and to her sister.\r\n\r\nCleveland approached within two yards of Minna, and bent his head to the\r\nground. There was a dead pause, until Minna said, in a firm but\r\nmelancholy tone, \"Unhappy man, why didst thou seek this aggravation of\r\nour woe? Depart in peace, and may Heaven direct thee to a better course\r\nthan that which thy life has yet held!\"\r\n\r\n\"Heaven will not aid me,\" said Cleveland, \"excepting by your voice. I\r\ncame hither rude and wild, scarce knowing that my trade, my desperate\r\ntrade, was more criminal in the sight of man or of Heaven, than that of\r\nthose privateers whom your law acknowledges. I was bred in it, and, but\r\nfor the wishes you have encouraged me to form, I should have perhaps\r\ndied in it, desperate and impenitent. O, do not throw me from you! let\r\nme do something to redeem what I have done amiss, and do not leave your\r\nown work half-finished!\"\r\n\r\n\"Cleveland,\" said Minna, \"I will not reproach you with abusing my\r\ninexperience, or with availing yourself of those delusions which the\r\ncredulity of early youth had flung around me, and which led me to\r\nconfound your fatal course of life with the deeds of our ancient heroes.\r\nAlas, when I saw your followers, that illusion was no more!--but I do\r\nnot upbraid you with its having existed. Go, Cleveland; detach yourself\r\nfrom those miserable wretches with whom you are associated, and believe\r\nme, that if Heaven yet grants you the means of distinguishing your name\r\nby one good or glorious action, there are eyes left in those lonely\r\nislands, that will weep as much for joy, as--as--they must now do for\r\nsorrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is this all?\" said Cleveland; \"and may I not hope, that if I\r\nextricate myself from my present associates--if I can gain my pardon by\r\nbeing as bold in the right, as I have been too often in the wrong\r\ncause--if, after a term, I care not how long--but still a term which may\r\nhave an end, I can boast of having redeemed my fame--may I not--may I\r\nnot hope that Minna may forgive what my God and my country shall have\r\npardoned?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never, Cleveland, never!\" said Minna, with the utmost firmness; \"on\r\nthis spot we part, and part for ever, and part without longer\r\nindulgence. Think of me as of one dead, if you continue as you now are;\r\nbut if, which may Heaven grant, you change your fatal course, think of\r\nme then as one, whose morning and evening prayers will be for your\r\nhappiness, though she has lost her own.--Farewell, Cleveland!\"\r\n\r\nHe kneeled, overpowered by his own bitter feelings, to take the hand\r\nwhich she held out to him, and in that instant, his confidant Bunce,\r\nstarting from behind one of the large upright pillars, his eyes wet with\r\ntears, exclaimed--\r\n\r\n\"Never saw such a parting scene on any stage! But I'll be d----d if you\r\nmake your exit as you expect!\"\r\n\r\nAnd so saying, ere Cleveland could employ either remonstrance or\r\nresistance, and indeed before he could get upon his feet, he easily\r\nsecured him by pulling him down on his back, so that two or three of the\r\nboat's crew seized him by the arms and legs, and began to hurry him\r\ntowards the lake. Minna and Brenda shrieked, and attempted to fly; but\r\nDerrick snatched up the former with as much ease as a falcon pounces on\r\na pigeon, while Bunce, with an oath or two which were intended to be of\r\na consolatory nature, seized on Brenda; and the whole party, with two or\r\nthree of the other pirates, who, stealing from the water-side, had\r\naccompanied them on the ambuscade, began hastily to run towards the\r\nboat, which was left in charge of two of their number. Their course,\r\nhowever, was unexpectedly interrupted, and their criminal purpose\r\nentirely frustrated.\r\n\r\nWhen Mordaunt Mertoun had turned out his guard in arms, it was with the\r\nnatural purpose of watching over the safety of the two sisters. They had\r\naccordingly closely observed the motions of the pirates, and when they\r\nsaw so many of them leave the boat and steal towards the place of\r\nrendezvous assigned to Cleveland, they naturally suspected treachery,\r\nand by cover of an old hollow way or trench, which perhaps had anciently\r\nbeen connected with the monumental circle, they had thrown themselves\r\nunperceived between the pirates and their boat. At the cries of the\r\nsisters, they started up and placed themselves in the way of the\r\nruffians, presenting their pieces, which, notwithstanding, they dared\r\nnot fire, for fear of hurting the young ladies, secured as they were in\r\nthe rude grasp of the marauders. Mordaunt, however, advanced with the\r\nspeed of a wild deer on Bunce, who, loath to quit his prey, yet unable\r\nto defend himself otherwise, turned to this side and that alternately,\r\nexposing Brenda to the blows which Mordaunt offered at him. This\r\ndefence, however, proved in vain against a youth, possessed of the\r\nlightest foot and most active hand ever known in Zetland, and after a\r\nfeint or two, Mordaunt brought the pirate to the ground with a stroke\r\nfrom the but of the carabine, which he dared not use otherwise. At the\r\nsame time fire-arms were discharged on either side by those who were\r\nliable to no such cause of forbearance, and the pirates who had hold of\r\nCleveland, dropped him, naturally enough, to provide for their own\r\ndefence or retreat. But they only added to the numbers of their enemies;\r\nfor Cleveland, perceiving Minna in the arms of Derrick, snatched her\r\nfrom the ruffian with one hand, and with the other shot him dead on the\r\nspot. Two or three more of the pirates fell or were taken, the rest fled\r\nto their boat, pushed off, then turned their broadside to the shore, and\r\nfired repeatedly on the Orcadian party, which they returned, with little\r\ninjury on either side. Meanwhile Mordaunt, having first seen that the\r\nsisters were at liberty and in full flight towards the house, advanced\r\non Cleveland with his cutlass drawn. The pirate presented a pistol, and\r\ncalling out at the same time,--\"Mordaunt, I never missed my aim,\" he\r\nfired into the air, and threw it into the lake; then drew his cutlass,\r\nbrandished it round his head, and flung that also as far as his arm\r\ncould send it, in the same direction. Yet such was the universal belief\r\nof his personal strength and resources, that Mordaunt still used\r\nprecaution, as, advancing on Cleveland, he asked if he surrendered.\r\n\r\n\"I surrender to no man,\" said the Pirate-captain; \"but you may see I\r\nhave thrown away my weapons.\"\r\n\r\nHe was immediately seized by some of the Orcadians without his offering\r\nany resistance; but the instant interference of Mordaunt prevented his\r\nbeing roughly treated, or bound. The victors conducted him to a\r\nwell-secured upper apartment in the House of Stennis, and placed a\r\nsentinel at the door. Bunce and Fletcher, both of whom had been\r\nstretched on the field during the skirmish, were lodged in the same\r\nchamber; and two prisoners, who appeared of lower rank, were confined\r\nin a vault belonging to the mansion.\r\n\r\nWithout pretending to describe the joy of Magnus Troil, who, when\r\nawakened by the noise and firing, found his daughters safe, and his\r\nenemy a prisoner, we shall only say, it was so great, that he forgot,\r\nfor the time at least, to enquire what circumstances were those which\r\nhad placed them in danger; that he hugged Mordaunt to his breast a\r\nthousand times, as their preserver; and swore as often by the bones of\r\nhis sainted namesake, that if he had a thousand daughters, so tight a\r\nlad, and so true a friend, should have the choice of them, let Lady\r\nGlowrowrum say what she would.\r\n\r\nA very different scene was passing in the prison-chamber of the\r\nunfortunate Cleveland and his associates. The Captain sat by the window,\r\nhis eyes bent on the prospect of the sea which it presented, and was\r\nseemingly so intent on it, as to be insensible of the presence of the\r\nothers. Jack Bunce stood meditating some ends of verse, in order to make\r\nhis advances towards a reconciliation with Cleveland; for he began to be\r\nsensible, from the consequences, that the part he had played towards his\r\nCaptain, however well intended, was neither lucky in its issue, nor\r\nlikely to be well taken. His admirer and adherent Fletcher lay half\r\nasleep, as it seemed, on a truckle-bed in the room, without the least\r\nattempt to interfere in the conversation which ensued.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, but speak to me, Clement,\" said the penitent Lieutenant, \"if it be\r\nbut to swear at me for my stupidity!\r\n\r\n  'What! not an oath?--Nay, then the world goes hard,\r\n  If Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I prithee peace, and be gone!\" said Cleveland; \"I have one bosom friend\r\nleft yet, and you will make me bestow its contents on you, or on\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have it!\" said Bunce, \"I have it!\" and on he went in the vein of\r\nJaffier--\r\n\r\n  \"'Then, by the hell I merit, I'll not leave thee,\r\n  Till to thyself at least thou'rt reconciled,\r\n  However thy resentment deal with me!'\"\r\n\r\n\"I pray you once more to be silent,\" said Cleveland--\"Is it not enough\r\nthat you have undone me with your treachery, but you must stun me with\r\nyour silly buffoonery?--I would not have believed _you_ would have\r\nlifted a finger against me, Jack, of any man or devil in yonder unhappy\r\nship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who, I?\" exclaimed Bunce, \"I lift a finger against you!--and if I did,\r\nit was in pure love, and to make you the happiest fellow that ever trode\r\na deck, with your mistress beside you, and fifty fine fellows at your\r\ncommand. Here is Dick Fletcher can bear witness I did all for the best,\r\nif he would but speak, instead of lolloping there like a Dutch dogger\r\nlaid up to be careened.--Get up, Dick, and speak for me, won't you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes, Jack Bunce,\" answered Fletcher, raising himself with\r\ndifficulty, and speaking feebly, \"I will if I can--and I always knew you\r\nspoke and did for the best--but howsomdever, d'ye see, it has turned out\r\nfor the worst for me this time, for I am bleeding to death, I think.\"\r\n\r\n\"You cannot be such an ass!\" said Jack Bunce, springing to his\r\nassistance, as did Cleveland. But human aid came too late--he sunk back\r\non the bed, and, turning on his face, expired without a groan.\r\n\r\n\"I always thought him a d----d fool,\" said Bunce, as he wiped a tear\r\nfrom his eye, \"but never such a consummate idiot as to hop the perch so\r\nsillily. I have lost the best follower\"--and he again wiped his eye.\r\n\r\nCleveland looked on the dead body, the rugged features of which had\r\nremained unaltered by the death-pang--\"A bull-dog,\" he said, \"of the\r\ntrue British breed, and, with a better counsellor, would have been a\r\nbetter man.\"\r\n\r\n\"You may say that of some other folks, too, Captain, if you are minded\r\nto do them justice,\" said Bunce.\r\n\r\n\"I may indeed, and especially of yourself,\" said Cleveland, in reply.\r\n\r\n\"Why then, say, _Jack, I forgive you_,\" said Bunce; \"it's but a short\r\nword, and soon spoken.\"\r\n\r\n\"I forgive you from all my soul, Jack,\" said Cleveland, who had resumed\r\nhis situation at the window; \"and the rather that your folly is of\r\nlittle consequence--the morning is come that must bring ruin on us all.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! you are thinking of the old woman's prophecy you spoke of?\" said\r\nBunce.\r\n\r\n\"It will soon be accomplished,\" answered Cleveland. \"Come hither; what\r\ndo you take yon large square-rigged vessel for, that you see doubling\r\nthe headland on the east, and opening the Bay of Stromness?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, I can't make her well out,\" said Bunce, \"but yonder is old Goffe,\r\ntakes her for a West Indiaman loaded with rum and sugar, I suppose, for\r\nd----n me if he does not slip cable, and stand out to her!\"\r\n\r\n\"Instead of running into the shoal-water, which was his only safety,\"\r\nsaid Cleveland--\"The fool! the dotard! the drivelling, drunken\r\nidiot!--he will get his flip hot enough; for yon is the Halcyon--See,\r\nshe hoists her colours and fires a broadside! and there will soon be an\r\nend of the Fortune's Favourite! I only hope they will fight her to the\r\nlast plank. The Boatswain used to be stanch enough, and so is Goffe,\r\nthough an incarnate demon.--Now she shoots away, with all the sail she\r\ncan spread, and that shows some sense.\"\r\n\r\n\"Up goes the Jolly Hodge, the old black flag, with the death's head and\r\nhour-glass, and that shows some spunk,\" added his comrade.\r\n\r\n\"The hour-glass is turned for us, Jack, for this bout--our sand is\r\nrunning fast.--Fire away yet, my roving lads! The deep sea or the blue\r\nsky, rather than a rope and a yard-arm!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of anxious and dead silence; the sloop, though hard\r\npressed, maintaining still a running fight, and the frigate continuing\r\nin full chase, but scarce returning a shot. At length the vessels neared\r\neach other, so as to show that the man-of-war intended to board the\r\nsloop, instead of sinking her, probably to secure the plunder which\r\nmight be in the pirate vessel.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Goffe--now, Boatswain!\" exclaimed Cleveland, in an ecstasy of\r\nimpatience, and as if they could have heard his commands, \"stand by\r\nsheets and tacks--rake her with a broadside, when you are under her\r\nbows, then about ship, and go off on the other tack like a wild-goose.\r\nThe sails shiver--the helm's a-lee--Ah!--deep-sea sink the\r\nlubbers!--they miss stays, and the frigate runs them aboard!\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, the various man[oe]uvres of the chase had brought them so\r\nnear, that Cleveland, with his spy-glass, could see the man-of-war's-men\r\nboarding by the yards and bowsprit, in irresistible numbers, their naked\r\ncutlasses flashing in the sun, when, at that critical moment, both ships\r\nwere enveloped in a cloud of thick black smoke, which suddenly arose on\r\nboard the captured pirate.\r\n\r\n\"Exeunt omnes!\" said Bunce, with clasped hands.\r\n\r\n\"There went the Fortune's Favourite, ship and crew!\" said Cleveland, at\r\nthe same instant.\r\n\r\nBut the smoke immediately clearing away, showed that the damage had only\r\nbeen partial, and that, from want of a sufficient quantity of powder,\r\nthe pirates had failed in their desperate attempt to blow up their\r\nvessel with the Halcyon.\r\n\r\nShortly after the action was over, Captain Weatherport of the Halcyon\r\nsent an officer and a party of marines to the House of Stennis, to\r\ndemand from the little garrison the pirate seamen who were their\r\nprisoners, and, in particular, Cleveland and Bunce, who acted as Captain\r\nand Lieutenant of the gang.\r\n\r\nThis was a demand which was not to be resisted, though Magnus Troil\r\ncould have wished sincerely that the roof under which he lived had been\r\nallowed as an asylum at least to Cleveland. But the officer's orders\r\nwere peremptory; and he added, it was Captain Weatherport's intention to\r\nland the other prisoners, and send the whole, with a sufficient escort,\r\nacross the island to Kirkwall, in order to undergo an examination there\r\nbefore the civil authorities, previous to their being sent off to London\r\nfor trial at the High Court of Admiralty. Magnus could therefore only\r\nintercede for good usage to Cleveland, and that he might not be stripped\r\nor plundered, which the officer, struck by his good mien, and\r\ncompassionating his situation, readily promised. The honest Udaller\r\nwould have said something in the way of comfort to Cleveland himself,\r\nbut he could not find words to express it, and only shook his head.\r\n\r\n\"Old friend,\" said Cleveland, \"you may have much to complain of--yet you\r\npity instead of exulting over me--for the sake of you and yours, I will\r\nnever harm human being more. Take this from me--my last hope, but my\r\nlast temptation also\"--he drew from his bosom a pocket-pistol, and gave\r\nit to Magnus Troil. \"Remember me to--But no--let every one forget me.--I\r\nam your prisoner, sir,\" said he to the officer.\r\n\r\n\"And I also,\" said poor Bunce; and putting on a theatrical countenance,\r\nhe ranted, with no very perceptible faltering in his tone, the words of\r\nPierre:\r\n\r\n  \"'Captain, you should be a gentleman of honour:\r\n  Keep off the rabble, that I may have room\r\n  To entertain my fate, and die with decency.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n  Joy, joy, in London now!\r\n\r\n                                                    SOUTHEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe news of the capture of the Rover reached Kirkwall, about an hour\r\nbefore noon, and filled all men with wonder and with joy. Little\r\nbusiness was that day done at the Fair, whilst people of all ages and\r\noccupations streamed from the place to see the prisoners as they were\r\nmarched towards Kirkwall, and to triumph in the different appearance\r\nwhich they now bore, from that which they had formerly exhibited when\r\nranting, swaggering, and bullying in the streets of that town. The\r\nbayonets of the marines were soon seen to glisten in the sun, and then\r\ncame on the melancholy troop of captives, handcuffed two and two\r\ntogether. Their finery had been partly torn from them by their captors,\r\npartly hung in rags about them; many were wounded and covered with\r\nblood, many blackened and scorched with the explosion, by which a few of\r\nthe most desperate had in vain striven to blow up the vessel. Most of\r\nthem seemed sullen and impenitent, some were more becomingly affected\r\nwith their condition, and a few braved it out, and sung the same ribald\r\nsongs to which they had made the streets of Kirkwall ring when they were\r\nin their frolics.\r\n\r\nThe Boatswain and Goffe, coupled together, exhausted themselves in\r\nthreats and imprecations against each other; the former charging Goffe\r\nwith want of seamanship, and the latter alleging that the Boatswain had\r\nprevented him from firing the powder that was stowed forward, and so\r\nsending them all to the other world together. Last came Cleveland and\r\nBunce, who were permitted to walk unshackled; the decent melancholy, yet\r\nresolved manner of the former, contrasting strongly with the stage strut\r\nand swagger which poor Jack thought it fitting to assume, in order to\r\nconceal some less dignified emotions. The former was looked upon with\r\ncompassion, the latter with a mixture of scorn and pity; while most of\r\nthe others inspired horror, and even fear, by their looks and their\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nThere was one individual in Kirkwall, who was so far from hastening to\r\nsee the sight which attracted all eyes, that he was not even aware of\r\nthe event which agitated the town. This was the elder Mertoun, whose\r\nresidence Kirkwall had been for two or three days, part of which had\r\nbeen spent in attending to some judicial proceedings, undertaken at the\r\ninstance of the Procurator Fiscal, against that grave professor, Bryce\r\nSnailsfoot. In consequence of an inquisition into the proceedings of\r\nthis worthy trader, Cleveland's chest, with his papers and other matters\r\ntherein contained, had been restored to Mertoun, as the lawful custodier\r\nthereof, until the right owner should be in a situation to establish his\r\nright to them. Mertoun was at first desirous to throw back upon Justice\r\nthe charge which she was disposed to intrust him with; but, on perusing\r\none or two of the papers, he hastily changed his mind--in broken words,\r\nrequested the Magistrate to let the chest be sent to his lodgings, and,\r\nhastening homeward, bolted himself into the room, to consider and\r\ndigest the singular information which chance had thus conveyed to him,\r\nand which increased, in a tenfold degree, his impatience for an\r\ninterview with the mysterious Norna of the Fitful-head.\r\n\r\nIt may be remembered that she had required of him, when they met in the\r\nChurchyard of Saint Ninian, to attend in the outer isle of the Cathedral\r\nof Saint Magnus, at the hour of noon, on the fifth day of the Fair of\r\nSaint Olla, there to meet a person by whom the fate of Mordaunt would be\r\nexplained to him.--\"It must be herself,\" he said; \"and that I should see\r\nher at this moment is indispensable. How to find her sooner, I know not;\r\nand better lose a few hours even in this exigence, than offend her by a\r\npremature attempt to force myself on her presence.\"\r\n\r\nLong, therefore, before noon--long before the town of Kirkwall was\r\nagitated by the news of the events on the other side of the island, the\r\nelder Mertoun was pacing the deserted aisle of the Cathedral, awaiting,\r\nwith agonizing eagerness, the expected communication from Norna. The\r\nbell tolled twelve--no door opened--no one was seen to enter the\r\nCathedral; but the last sounds had not ceased to reverberate through the\r\nvaulted roof, when, gliding from one of the interior side-aisles, Norna\r\nstood before him. Mertoun, indifferent to the apparent mystery of her\r\nsudden approach, (with the secret of which the reader is acquainted,)\r\nwent up to her at once, with the earnest ejaculation--\"Ulla--Ulla\r\nTroil--aid me to save our unhappy boy!\"\r\n\r\n\"To Ulla Troil,\" said Norna, \"I answer not--I gave that name to the\r\nwinds, on the night that cost me a father!\"\r\n\r\n\"Speak not of that night of horror,\" said Mertoun; \"we have need of our\r\nreason--let us not think on recollections which may destroy it; but aid\r\nme, if thou canst, to save our unfortunate child!\"\r\n\r\n\"Vaughan,\" answered Norna, \"he is already saved--long since saved; think\r\nyou a mother's hand--and that of such a mother as I am--would await your\r\ncrawling, tardy, ineffectual assistance? No, Vaughan--I make myself\r\nknown to you, but to show my triumph over you--it is the only revenge\r\nwhich the powerful Norna permits herself to take for the wrongs of Ulla\r\nTroil.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you indeed saved him--saved him from the murderous crew?\" said\r\nMertoun, or Vaughan--\"speak!--and speak truth!--I will believe every\r\nthing--all you would require me to assent to!--prove to me only he is\r\nescaped and safe!\"\r\n\r\n\"Escaped and safe, by my means,\" said Norna--\"safe, and in assurance of\r\nan honoured and happy alliance. Yes, great unbeliever!--yes, wise and\r\nself-opinioned infidel!--these were the works of Norna! I knew you many\r\na year since; but never had I made myself known to you, save with the\r\ntriumphant consciousness of having controlled the destiny that\r\nthreatened my son. All combined against him--planets which threatened\r\ndrowning--combinations which menaced blood--but my skill was superior to\r\nall.--I arranged--I combined--I found means--I made them--each disaster\r\nhas been averted;--and what infidel on earth, or stubborn demon beyond\r\nthe bounds of earth, shall hereafter deny my power?\"\r\n\r\nThe wild ecstasy with which she spoke, so much resembled triumphant\r\ninsanity, that Mertoun answered--\"Were your pretensions less lofty, and\r\nyour speech more plain, I should be better assured of my son's safety.\"\r\n\r\n\"Doubt on, vain sceptic!\" said Norna--\"And yet know, that not only is\r\nour son safe, but vengeance is mine, though I sought it not--vengeance\r\non the powerful implement of the darker Influences by whom my schemes\r\nwere so often thwarted, and even the life of my son endangered.--Yes,\r\ntake it as a guarantee of the truth of my speech, that Cleveland--the\r\npirate Cleveland--even now enters Kirkwall as a prisoner, and will soon\r\nexpiate with his life the having shed blood which is of kin to Norna's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who didst thou say was prisoner?\" exclaimed Mertoun, with a voice of\r\nthunder--\"_Who_, woman, didst thou say should expiate his crimes with\r\nhis life?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cleveland--the pirate Cleveland!\" answered Norna; \"and by me, whose\r\ncounsel he scorned, he has been permitted to meet his fate.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thou most wretched of women!\" said Mertoun, speaking from between his\r\nclenched teeth,--\"thou hast slain thy son, as well as thy father!\"\r\n\r\n\"My son!--what son?--what mean you?--Mordaunt is your son--your only\r\nson!\" exclaimed Norna--\"is he not?--tell me quickly--is he not?\"\r\n\r\n\"Mordaunt is indeed _my_ son,\" said Mertoun--\"the laws, at least, gave\r\nhim to me as such--But, O unhappy Ulla! Cleveland is your son as well as\r\nmine--blood of our blood, bone of our bone; and if you have given him to\r\ndeath, I will end my wretched life along with him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay--hold--stop, Vaughan!\" said Norna; \"I am not yet overcome--prove\r\nbut to me the truth of what you say, I would find help, if I should\r\nevoke hell!--But prove your words, else believe them I cannot.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Thou_ help! wretched, overweening woman!--in what have thy\r\ncombinations and thy stratagems--the legerdemain of lunacy--the mere\r\nquackery of insanity--in what have these involved thee?--and yet I will\r\nspeak to thee as reasonable--nay, I will admit thee as powerful--Hear,\r\nthen, Ulla, the proofs which you demand, and find a remedy, if thou\r\ncanst:--\r\n\r\n\"When I fled from Orkney,\" he continued, after a pause--\"it is now\r\nfive-and-twenty years since--I bore with me the unhappy offspring to\r\nwhom you had given light. It was sent to me by one of your kinswomen,\r\nwith an account of your illness, which was soon followed by a generally\r\nreceived belief of your death. It avails not to tell in what misery I\r\nleft Europe. I found refuge in Hispaniola, wherein a fair young Spaniard\r\nundertook the task of comforter. I married her--she became mother of the\r\nyouth called Mordaunt Mertoun.\"\r\n\r\n\"You married her!\" said Norna, in a tone of deep reproach.\r\n\r\n\"I did, Ulla,\" answered Mertoun; \"but you were avenged. She proved\r\nfaithless, and her infidelity left me in doubts whether the child she\r\nbore had a right to call me father--But I also was avenged.\"\r\n\r\n\"You murdered her!\" said Norna, with a dreadful shriek.\r\n\r\n\"I did that,\" said Mertoun, without a more direct reply, \"which made an\r\ninstant flight from Hispaniola necessary. Your son I carried with me to\r\nTortuga, where we had a small settlement. Mordaunt Vaughan, my son by\r\nmarriage, about three or four years younger, was residing in\r\nPort-Royal, for the advantages of an English education. I resolved never\r\nto see him again, but I continued to support him. Our settlement was\r\nplundered by the Spaniards, when Clement was but fifteen--Want came to\r\naid despair and a troubled conscience. I became a corsair, and involved\r\nClement in the same desperate trade. His skill and bravery, though then\r\na mere boy, gained him a separate command; and after a lapse of two or\r\nthree years, while we were on different cruises, my crew rose on me, and\r\nleft me for dead on the beach of one of the Bermudas. I recovered,\r\nhowever, and my first enquiries, after a tedious illness, were after\r\nClement. He, I heard, had been also marooned by a rebellious crew, and\r\nput ashore on a desert islet, to perish with want--I believed he had so\r\nperished.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what assures you that he did not?\" said Ulla; \"or how comes this\r\nCleveland to be identified with Vaughan?\"\r\n\r\n\"To change a name is common with such adventurers,\" answered Mertoun,\r\n\"and Clement had apparently found that of Vaughan had become too\r\nnotorious--and this change, in his case, prevented me from hearing any\r\ntidings of him. It was then that remorse seized me, and that, detesting\r\nall nature, but especially the sex to which Louisa belonged, I resolved\r\nto do penance in the wild islands of Zetland for the rest of my life. To\r\nsubject myself to fasts and to the scourge, was the advice of the holy\r\nCatholic priests, whom I consulted. But I devised a nobler penance--I\r\ndetermined to bring with me the unhappy boy Mordaunt, and to keep always\r\nbefore me the living memorial of my misery and my guilt. I have done so,\r\nand I have thought over both, till reason has often trembled on her\r\nthrone. And now, to drive me to utter madness, my Clement--my own, my\r\nundoubted son, revives from the dead to be consigned to an infamous\r\ndeath, by the machinations of his own mother!\"\r\n\r\n\"Away, away!\" said Norna, with a laugh, when she had heard the story to\r\nan end, \"this is a legend framed by the old corsair, to interest my aid\r\nin favour of a guilty comrade. How could I mistake Mordaunt for my son,\r\ntheir ages being so different?\"\r\n\r\n\"The dark complexion and manly stature may have done much,\" said Basil\r\nMertoun; \"strong imagination must have done the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, give me proofs--give me proofs that this Cleveland is my son, and,\r\nbelieve me, this sun shall sooner sink in the east, than they shall have\r\npower to harm a hair of his head.\"\r\n\r\n\"These papers, these journals,\" said Mertoun, offering the pocket-book.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot read them,\" she said, after an effort, \"my brain is dizzy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Clement has also tokens which you may remember, but they must have\r\nbecome the booty of his captors. He had a silver box with a Runic\r\ninscription, with which in far other days you presented me--a golden\r\nchaplet.\"\r\n\r\n\"A box!\" said Norna, hastily; \"Cleveland gave me one but a day since--I\r\nhave never looked at it till now.\"\r\n\r\nEagerly she pulled it out--eagerly examined the legend around the lid,\r\nand as eagerly exclaimed--\"They may now indeed call me Reimkennar, for\r\nby this rhyme I know myself murderess of my son, as well as of my\r\nfather!\"\r\n\r\nThe conviction of the strong delusion under which she had laboured, was\r\nso overwhelming, that she sunk down at the foot of one of the\r\npillars--Mertoun shouted for help, though in despair of receiving any;\r\nthe sexton, however, entered, and, hopeless of all assistance from\r\nNorna, the distracted father rushed out, to learn, if possible, the fate\r\nof his son.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n  Go, some of you cry a reprieve!\r\n\r\n                                           _Beggar's Opera._\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Weatherport had, before this time, reached Kirkwall in person,\r\nand was received with great joy and thankfulness by the Magistrates, who\r\nhad assembled in council for the purpose. The Provost, in particular,\r\nexpressed himself delighted with the providential arrival of the\r\nHalcyon, at the very conjuncture when the Pirate could not escape her.\r\nThe Captain looked a little surprised, and said--\"For that, sir, you may\r\nthank the information you yourself supplied.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I supplied?\" said the Provost, somewhat astonished.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered Captain Weatherport, \"I understand you to be George\r\nTorfe, Chief Magistrate of Kirkwall, who subscribes this letter.\"\r\n\r\nThe astonished Provost took the letter addressed to Captain Weatherport\r\nof the Halcyon, stating the arrival, force, &c., of the pirates' vessel;\r\nbut adding, that they had heard of the Halcyon being on the coast, and\r\nthat they were on their guard and ready to baffle her, by going among\r\nthe shoals, and through the islands, and holms, where the frigate could\r\nnot easily follow; and at the worst, they were desperate enough to\r\npropose running the sloop ashore and blowing her up, by which much booty\r\nand treasure would be lost to the captors. The letter, therefore,\r\nsuggested, that the Halcyon should cruise betwixt Duncansbay Head and\r\nCape Wrath, for two or three days, to relieve the pirates of the alarm\r\nher neighbourhood occasioned, and lull them into security, the more\r\nespecially as the letter-writer knew it to be their intention, if the\r\nfrigate left the coast, to go into Stromness Bay, and there put their\r\nguns ashore for some necessary repairs, or even for careening their\r\nvessel, if they could find means. The letter concluded by assuring\r\nCaptain Weatherport, that, if he could bring his frigate into Stromness\r\nBay on the morning of the 24th of August, he would have a good bargain\r\nof the pirates--if sooner, he was not unlikely to miss them.\r\n\r\n\"This letter is not of my writing or subscribing, Captain Weatherport,\"\r\nsaid the Provost; \"nor would I have ventured to advise any delay in your\r\ncoming hither.\"\r\n\r\nThe Captain was surprised in his turn. \"All I know is, that it reached\r\nme when I was in the bay of Thurso, and that I gave the boat's crew that\r\nbrought it five dollars for crossing the Pentland Frith in very rough\r\nweather. They had a dumb dwarf as cockswain, the ugliest urchin my eyes\r\never opened upon. I give you much credit for the accuracy of your\r\nintelligence, Mr. Provost.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is lucky as it is,\" said the Provost; \"yet I question whether the\r\nwriter of this letter would not rather that you had found the nest cold\r\nand the bird flown.\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, he handed the letter to Magnus Troil, who returned it with a\r\nsmile, but without any observation, aware, doubtless, with the sagacious\r\nreader, that Norna had her own reasons for calculating with accuracy on\r\nthe date of the Halcyon's arrival.\r\n\r\nWithout puzzling himself farther concerning a circumstance which seemed\r\ninexplicable, the Captain requested that the examinations might proceed;\r\nand Cleveland and Altamont, as he chose to be called, were brought up\r\nthe first of the pirate crew, on the charge of having acted as Captain\r\nand Lieutenant. They had just commenced the examination, when, after\r\nsome expostulation with the officers who kept the door, Basil Mertoun\r\nburst into the apartment and exclaimed, \"Take the old victim for the\r\nyoung one!--I am Basil Vaughan, too well known on the windward\r\nstation--take my life, and spare my son's!\"\r\n\r\nAll were astonished, and none more than Magnus Troil, who hastily\r\nexplained to the Magistrates and Captain Weatherport, that this\r\ngentleman had been living peaceably and honestly on the Mainland of\r\nZetland for many years.\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" said the Captain, \"I wash my hands of the poor man, for\r\nhe is safe, under two proclamations of mercy; and, by my soul, when I\r\nsee them, the father and his offspring, hanging on each other's neck, I\r\nwish I could say as much for the son.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how is it--how can it be?\" said the Provost; \"we always called the\r\nold man Mertoun, and the young, Cleveland, and now it seems they are\r\nboth named Vaughan.\"\r\n\r\n\"Vaughan,\" answered Magnus, \"is a name which I have some reason to\r\nremember; and, from what I have lately heard from my cousin Norna, that\r\nold man has a right to bear it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And, I trust, the young man also,\" said the Captain, who had been\r\nlooking over a memorandum. \"Listen to me a moment,\" added he, addressing\r\nthe younger Vaughan, whom we have hitherto called Cleveland. \"Hark you,\r\nsir, your name is said to be Clement Vaughan--are you the same, who,\r\nthen a mere boy, commanded a party of rovers, who, about eight or nine\r\nyears ago, pillaged a Spanish village called Quempoa, on the Spanish\r\nMain, with the purpose of seizing some treasure?\"\r\n\r\n\"It will avail me nothing to deny it,\" answered the prisoner.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Captain Weatherport, \"but it may do you service to admit\r\nit.--Well, the muleteers escaped with the treasure, while you were\r\nengaged in protecting, at the hazard of your own life, the honour of two\r\nSpanish ladies against the brutality of your followers. Do you remember\r\nany thing of this?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure _I_ do,\" said Jack Bunce; \"for our Captain here was marooned\r\nfor his gallantry, and I narrowly escaped flogging and pickling for\r\nhaving taken his part.\"\r\n\r\n\"When these points are established,\" said Captain Weatherport,\r\n\"Vaughan's life is safe--the women he saved were persons of quality,\r\ndaughters to the governor of the province, and application was long\r\nsince made, by the grateful Spaniard, to our government, for favour to\r\nbe shown to their preserver. I had special orders about Clement Vaughan,\r\nwhen I had a commission for cruizing upon the pirates, in the West\r\nIndies, six or seven years since. But Vaughan was gone then as a name\r\namongst them; and I heard enough of Cleveland in his room. However,\r\nCaptain, be you Cleveland or Vaughan, I think that, as the Quempoa hero,\r\nI can assure you a free pardon when you arrive in London.\"\r\n\r\nCleveland bowed, and the blood mounted to his face. Mertoun fell on his\r\nknees, and exhausted himself in thanksgiving to Heaven. They were\r\nremoved, amidst the sympathizing sobs of the spectators.\r\n\r\n\"And now, good Master Lieutenant, what have you got to say for\r\nyourself?\" said Captain Weatherport to the ci-devant Roscius.\r\n\r\n\"Why, little or nothing, please your honour; only that I wish your\r\nhonour could find my name in that book of mercy you have in your hand;\r\nfor I stood by Captain Clement Vaughan in that Quempoa business.\"\r\n\r\n\"You call yourself Frederick Altamont?\" said Captain Weatherport. \"I can\r\nsee no such name here; one John Bounce, or Bunce, the lady put on her\r\ntablets.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, that is me--that is I myself, Captain--I can prove it; and I am\r\ndetermined, though the sound be something plebeian, rather to live Jack\r\nBunce, than to hang as Frederick Altamont.\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" said the Captain, \"I can give you some hopes as John\r\nBunce.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank your noble worship!\" shouted Bunce; then changing his tone, he\r\nsaid, \"Ah, since an alias has such virtue, poor Dick Fletcher might have\r\ncome off as Timothy Tugmutton; but howsomdever, d'ye see, to use his own\r\nphrase\"----\r\n\r\n\"Away with the Lieutenant,\" said the Captain, \"and bring forward Goffe\r\nand the other fellows; there will be ropes reeved for some of them, I\r\nthink.\" And this prediction promised to be amply fulfilled, so strong\r\nwas the proof which was brought against them.\r\n\r\nThe Halcyon was accordingly ordered round to carry the whole prisoners\r\nto London, for which she set sail in the course of two days.\r\n\r\nDuring the time that the unfortunate Cleveland remained at Kirkwall, he\r\nwas treated with civility by the Captain of the Halcyon; and the\r\nkindness of his old acquaintance, Magnus Troil, who knew in secret how\r\nclosely he was allied to his blood, pressed on him accommodations of\r\nevery kind, more than he could be prevailed on to accept.\r\n\r\nNorna, whose interest in the unhappy prisoner was still more deep, was\r\nat this time unable to express it. The sexton had found her lying on the\r\npavement in a swoon, and when she recovered, her mind for the time had\r\ntotally lost its equipoise, and it became necessary to place her under\r\nthe restraint of watchful attendants.\r\n\r\nOf the sisters of Burgh-Westra, Cleveland only heard that they remained\r\nill, in consequence of the fright to which they had been subjected,\r\nuntil the evening before the Halcyon sailed, when he received, by a\r\nprivate conveyance, the following billet:\r\n\r\n    --\"Farewell, Cleveland--we part for ever, and it is right that we\r\n    should--Be virtuous and be happy. The delusions which a solitary\r\n    education and limited acquaintance with the modern world had\r\n    spread around me, are gone and dissipated for ever. But in you, I\r\n    am sure, I have been thus far free from error--that you are one to\r\n    whom good is naturally more attractive than evil, and whom only\r\n    necessity, example, and habit, have forced into your late course\r\n    of life. Think of me as one who no longer exists, unless you\r\n    should become as much the object of general praise, as now of\r\n    general reproach; and then think of me as one who will rejoice in\r\n    your reviving fame, though she must never see you  more!\"--\r\n\r\nThe note was signed M. T.; and Cleveland, with a deep emotion, which he\r\ntestified even by tears, read it an hundred times over, and then\r\nclasped it to his bosom.\r\n\r\nMordaunt Mertoun heard by letter from his father, but in a very\r\ndifferent style. Basil bade him farewell for ever, and acquitted him\r\nhenceforward of the duties of a son, as one on whom he, notwithstanding\r\nthe exertions of many years, had found himself unable to bestow the\r\naffections of a parent. The letter informed him of a recess in the old\r\nhouse of Jarlshof, in which the writer had deposited a considerable\r\nquantity of specie and of treasure, which he desired Mordaunt to use as\r\nhis own. \"You need not fear,\" the letter bore, \"either that you lay\r\nyourself under obligation to me, or that you are sharing the spoils of\r\npiracy. What is now given over to you, is almost entirely the property\r\nof your deceased mother, Louisa Gonzago, and is yours by every right.\r\nLet us forgive each other,\" was the conclusion, \"as they who must meet\r\nno more.\"--And they never met more; for the elder Mertoun, against whom\r\nno charge was ever preferred, disappeared after the fate of Cleveland\r\nwas determined, and was generally believed to have retired into a\r\nforeign convent.\r\n\r\nThe fate of Cleveland will be most briefly expressed in a letter which\r\nMinna received within two months after the Halcyon left Kirkwall. The\r\nfamily were then assembled at Burgh-Westra, and Mordaunt was a member of\r\nit for the time, the good Udaller thinking he could never sufficiently\r\nrepay the activity which he had shown in the defence of his daughters.\r\nNorna, then beginning to recover from her temporary alienation of mind,\r\nwas a guest in the family, and Minna, who was sedulous in her attention\r\nupon this unfortunate victim of mental delusion, was seated with her,\r\nwatching each symptom of returning reason, when the letter we allude to\r\nwas placed in her hands.\r\n\r\n    \"Minna,\" it said--\"dearest Minna!--farewell, and for ever! Believe\r\n    me, I never meant you wrong--never. From the moment I came to know\r\n    you, I resolved to detach myself from my hateful comrades, and had\r\n    framed a thousand schemes, which have proved as vain as they\r\n    deserved to be--for why, or how, should the fate of her that is so\r\n    lovely, pure, and innocent, be involved with that of one so\r\n    guilty?--Of these dreams I will speak no more. The stern reality\r\n    of my situation is much milder than I either expected or deserved;\r\n    and the little good I did has outweighed, in the minds of\r\n    honourable and merciful judges, much that was evil and criminal. I\r\n    have not only been exempted from the ignominious death to which\r\n    several of my compeers are sentenced; but Captain Weatherport,\r\n    about once more to sail for the Spanish Main, under the\r\n    apprehension of an immediate war with that country, has generously\r\n    solicited and obtained permission to employ me, and two or three\r\n    more of my less guilty associates, in the same service--a measure\r\n    recommended to himself by his own generous compassion, and to\r\n    others by our knowledge of the coast, and of local circumstances,\r\n    which, by whatever means acquired, we now hope to use for the\r\n    service of our country. Minna, you will hear my name pronounced\r\n    with honour, or you will never hear it again. If virtue can give\r\n    happiness, I need not wish it to you, for it is yours\r\n    already.--Farewell, Minna.\"\r\n\r\nMinna wept so bitterly over this letter, that it attracted the attention\r\nof the convalescent Norna. She snatched it from the hand of her\r\nkinswoman, and read it over at first with the confused air of one to\r\nwhom it conveyed no intelligence--then with a dawn of recollection--then\r\nwith a burst of mingled joy and grief, in which she dropped it from her\r\nhand. Minna snatched it up, and retired with her treasure to her own\r\napartment.\r\n\r\nFrom that time Norna appeared to assume a different character. Her dress\r\nwas changed to one of a more simple and less imposing appearance. Her\r\ndwarf was dismissed, with ample provision for his future comfort. She\r\nshowed no desire of resuming her erratic life; and directed her\r\nobservatory, as it might be called, on Fitful-head, to be dismantled.\r\nShe refused the name of Norna, and would only be addressed by her real\r\nappellation of Ulla Troil. But the most important change remained\r\nbehind. Formerly, from the dreadful dictates of spiritual despair,\r\narising out of the circumstances of her father's death, she seemed to\r\nhave considered herself as an outcast from divine grace; besides, that,\r\nenveloped in the vain occult sciences which she pretended to practise,\r\nher study, like that of Chaucer's physician, had been \"but little in the\r\nBible.\" Now, the sacred volume was seldom laid aside; and, to the poor\r\nignorant people who came as formerly to invoke her power over the\r\nelements, she only replied--\"_The winds are in the hollow of His\r\nhand._\"--Her conversion was not, perhaps, altogether rational; for this,\r\nthe state of a mind disordered by such a complication of horrid\r\nincidents, probably prevented. But it seemed to be sincere, and was\r\ncertainly useful. She appeared deeply to repent of her former\r\npresumptuous attempts to interfere with the course of human events,\r\nsuperintended as they are by far higher powers, and expressed bitter\r\ncompunction when such her former pretensions were in any manner\r\nrecalled to her memory. She still showed a partiality to Mordaunt,\r\nthough, perhaps, arising chiefly from habit; nor was it easy to know how\r\nmuch or how little she remembered of the complicated events in which she\r\nhad been connected. When she died, which was about four years after the\r\nevents we have commemorated, it was found that, at the special and\r\nearnest request of Minna Troil, she had conveyed her very considerable\r\nproperty to Brenda. A clause in her will specially directed, that all\r\nthe books, implements of her laboratory, and other things connected with\r\nher former studies, should be committed to the flames.\r\n\r\nAbout two years before Norna's death, Brenda was wedded to Mordaunt\r\nMertoun. It was some time before old Magnus Troil, with all his\r\naffection for his daughter, and all his partiality for Mordaunt, was\r\nable frankly to reconcile himself to this match. But Mordaunt's\r\naccomplishments were peculiarly to the Udaller's taste, and the old man\r\nfelt the impossibility of supplying his place in his family so\r\nabsolutely, that at length his Norse blood gave way to the natural\r\nfeeling of the heart, and he comforted his pride while he looked around\r\nhim, and saw what he considered as the encroachments of the Scottish\r\ngentry upon THE COUNTRY, (so Zetland is fondly termed by its\r\ninhabitants,) that as well \"his daughter married the son of an English\r\npirate, as of a Scottish thief,\" in scornful allusion to the Highland\r\nand Border families, to whom Zetland owes many respectable landholders;\r\nbut whose ancestors were generally esteemed more renowned for ancient\r\nfamily and high courage, than for accurately regarding the trifling\r\ndistinctions of _meum_ and _tuum_. The jovial old man lived to the\r\nextremity of human life, with the happy prospect of a numerous\r\nsuccession in the family of his younger daughter; and having his board\r\ncheered alternately by the minstrelsy of Claud Halcro, and enlightened\r\nby the lucubrations of Mr. Triptolemus Yellowley, who, laying aside his\r\nhigh pretensions, was, when he became better acquainted with the manners\r\nof the islanders, and remembered the various misadventures which had\r\nattended his premature attempts at reformation, an honest and useful\r\nrepresentative of his principal, and never so happy as when he could\r\nescape from the spare commons of his sister Barbara, to the genial table\r\nof the Udaller. Barbara's temper also was much softened by the\r\nunexpected restoration of the horn of silver coins, (the property of\r\nNorna,) which she had concealed in the mansion of old Stourburgh, for\r\nachieving some of her mysterious plans, but which she now restored to\r\nthose by whom it had been accidentally discovered, with an intimation,\r\nhowever, that it would again disappear unless a reasonable portion was\r\nexpended on the sustenance of the family, a precaution to which Tronda\r\nDronsdaughter (probably an agent of Norna's) owed her escape from a slow\r\nand wasting death by inanition.\r\n\r\nMordaunt and Brenda were as happy as our mortal condition permits us to\r\nbe. They admired and loved each other--enjoyed easy circumstances--had\r\nduties to discharge which they did not neglect; and, clear in conscience\r\nas light of heart, laughed, sung, danced, daffed the world aside, and\r\nbid it pass.\r\n\r\nBut Minna--the high-minded and imaginative Minna--she, gifted with such\r\ndepth of feeling and enthusiasm, yet doomed to see both blighted in\r\nearly youth, because, with the inexperience of a disposition equally\r\nromantic and ignorant, she had built the fabric of her happiness on a\r\nquicksand instead of a rock,--was she, could she be happy? Reader, she\r\n_was_ happy, for, whatever may be alleged to the contrary by the sceptic\r\nand the scorner, to each duty performed there is assigned a degree of\r\nmental peace and high consciousness of honourable exertion,\r\ncorresponding to the difficulty of the task accomplished. That rest of\r\nthe body which succeeds to hard and industrious toil, is not to be\r\ncompared to the repose which the spirit enjoys under similar\r\ncircumstances. Her resignation, however, and the constant attention\r\nwhich she paid to her father, her sister, the afflicted Norna, and to\r\nall who had claims on her, were neither Minna's sole nor her most\r\nprecious source of comfort. Like Norna, but under a more regulated\r\njudgment, she learned to exchange the visions of wild enthusiasm which\r\nhad exerted and misled her imagination, for a truer and purer connexion\r\nwith the world beyond us, than could be learned from the sagas of\r\nheathen bards, or the visions of later rhymers. To this she owed the\r\nsupport by which she was enabled, after various accounts of the\r\nhonourable and gallant conduct of Cleveland, to read with resignation,\r\nand even with a sense of comfort, mingled with sorrow, that he had at\r\nlength fallen, leading the way in a gallant and honourable enterprise,\r\nwhich was successfully accomplished by those companions, to whom his\r\ndetermined bravery had opened the road. Bunce, his fantastic follower in\r\ngood, as formerly in evil, transmitted an account to Minna of this\r\nmelancholy event, in terms which showed, that though his head was weak,\r\nhis heart had not been utterly corrupted by the lawless life which he\r\nhad for some time led, or at least that it had been amended by the\r\nchange; and that he himself had gained credit and promotion in the same\r\naction, seemed to be of little consequence to him, compared with the\r\nloss of his old captain and comrade.[41] Minna read the intelligence,\r\nand thanked Heaven, even while the eyes which she lifted up were\r\nstreaming with tears, that the death of Cleveland had been in the bed of\r\nhonour; nay, she even had the courage to add her gratitude, that he had\r\nbeen snatched from a situation of temptation ere circumstances had\r\novercome his new-born virtue; and so strongly did this reflection\r\noperate, that her life, after the immediate pain of this event had\r\npassed away, seemed not only as resigned, but even more cheerful than\r\nbefore. Her thoughts, however, were detached from the world, and only\r\nvisited it, with an interest like that which guardian spirits take for\r\ntheir charge, in behalf of those friends with whom she lived in love, or\r\nof the poor whom she could serve and comfort. Thus passed her life,\r\nenjoying from all who approached her, an affection enhanced by\r\nreverence; insomuch, that when her friends sorrowed for her death, which\r\narrived at a late period of her existence, they were comforted by the\r\nfond reflection, that the humanity which she then laid down, was the\r\nonly circumstance which had placed her, in the words of Scripture, \"a\r\nlittle lower than the angels!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[41] We have been able to learn nothing with certainty of Bunce's fate;\r\nbut our friend, Dr Dryasdust, believes he may be identified with an old\r\ngentleman, who, in the beginning of the reign of George I., attended the\r\nRose Coffee-house regularly, went to the theatre every night, told\r\nmercilessly long stories about the Spanish Main, controlled reckonings,\r\nbullied waiters, and was generally known by the name of Captain Bounce.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR'S NOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote I., p. 17.--FORTUNE-TELLING RHYMES.\r\n\r\nThe author has in Chapter I. supposed that a very ancient northern\r\ncustom, used by those who were accounted soothsaying women, might have\r\nsurvived, though in jest rather than earnest, among the Zetlanders,\r\ntheir descendants. The following original account of such a scene will\r\nshow the ancient importance and consequence of such a prophetic\r\ncharacter as was assumed by Norna:--\r\n\r\n\"There lived in the same territory (Greenland) a woman named Thorbiorga,\r\nwho was a prophetess, and called the little Vola, (or fatal sister,) the\r\nonly one of nine sisters who survived. Thorbiorga during the winter used\r\nto frequent the festivities of the season, invited by those who were\r\ndesirous of learning their own fortune, and the future events which\r\nimpended. Torquil being a man of consequence in the country, it fell to\r\nhis lot to enquire how long the dearth was to endure with which the\r\ncountry was then afflicted; he therefore invited the prophetess to his\r\nhouse, having made liberal preparation, as was the custom, for receiving\r\na guest of such consequence. The seat of the soothsayer was placed in an\r\neminent situation, and covered with pillows filled with the softest\r\neider down. In the evening she arrived, together with a person who had\r\nbeen sent to meet her, and show her the way to Torquil's habitation. She\r\nwas attired as follows: She had a sky-blue tunick, having the front\r\nornamented with gems from the top to the bottom, and wore around her\r\nthroat a necklace of glass beads.[42] Her head-gear was of black\r\nlambskin, the lining being the fur of a white wild-cat. She leant on a\r\nstaff, having a ball at the top.[43] The staff was ornamented with\r\nbrass, and the ball or globe with gems or pebbles. She wore a Hunland\r\n(or Hungarian) girdle, to which was attached a large pouch, in which she\r\nkept her magical implements. Her shoes were of sealskin, dressed with\r\nthe hair outside, and secured by long and thick straps, fastened by\r\nbrazen clasps. She wore gloves of the wild-cat's skin, with the fur\r\ninmost. As this venerable person entered the hall, all saluted her with\r\ndue respect; but she only returned the compliments of such as were\r\nagreeable to her. Torquil conducted her with reverence to the seat\r\nprepared for her, and requested she would purify the apartment and\r\ncompany assembled, by casting her eyes over them. She was by no means\r\nsparing of her words. The table being at length covered, such viands\r\nwere placed before Thorbiorga as suited her character of a soothsayer.\r\nThese were, a preparation of goat's milk, and a mess composed of the\r\nhearts of various animals; the prophetess made use of a brazen spoon,\r\nand a pointless knife, the handle of which was composed of a whale's\r\ntooth, and ornamented with two rings of brass. The table being removed,\r\nTorquil addressed Thorbiorga, requesting her opinion of his house and\r\nguests, at the same time intimating the subjects on which he and the\r\ncompany were desirous to consult her.\r\n\r\n\"Thorbiorga replied, it was impossible for her to answer their enquiries\r\nuntil she had slept a night under his roof. The next morning, therefore,\r\nthe magical apparatus necessary for her purpose was prepared, and she\r\nthen enquired, as a necessary part of the ceremony, whether there was\r\nany female present who could sing a magical song called '_Vardlokur_.'\r\nWhen no songstress such as she desired could be found, Gudrida, the\r\ndaughter of Torquil, replied, 'I am no sorceress or soothsayer; but my\r\nnurse, Haldisa, taught me, when in Iceland, a song called\r\n_Vardlokur_.'--'Then thou knowest more than I was aware of,' said\r\nTorquil. 'But as I am a Christian,' continued Gudrida, 'I consider these\r\nrites as matters which it is unlawful to promote, and the song itself as\r\nunlawful.'--'Nevertheless,' answered the soothsayer, 'thou mayst help us\r\nin this matter without any harm to thy religion, since the task will\r\nremain with Torquil to provide every thing necessary for the present\r\npurpose.' Torquil also earnestly entreated Gudrida, till she consented\r\nto grant his request. The females then surrounded Thorbiorga, who took\r\nher place on a sort of elevated stage; Gudrida then sung the magic song,\r\nwith a voice so sweet and tuneful, as to excel any thing that had been\r\nheard by any present. The soothsayer, delighted with the melody,\r\nreturned thanks to the singer, and then said, 'Much I have now learned\r\nof dearth and disease approaching the country, and many things are now\r\nclear to me which before were hidden as well from me as others. Our\r\npresent dearth of substance shall not long endure for the present, and\r\nplenty will in the spring succeed to scarcity. The contagious diseases\r\nalso, with which the country has been for some time afflicted, will in a\r\nshort time take their departure. To thee, Gudrida, I can, in recompense\r\nfor thy assistance on this occasion, announce a fortune of higher import\r\nthan any one could have conjectured. You shall be married to a man of\r\nname here in Greenland; but you shall not long enjoy that union, for\r\nyour fate recalls you to Iceland, where you shall become the mother of a\r\nnumerous and honourable family, which shall be enlightened by a luminous\r\nray of good fortune. So, my daughter, wishing thee health, I bid thee\r\nfarewell.' The prophetess, having afterwards given answers to all\r\nqueries which were put to her, either by Torquil or his guests, departed\r\nto show her skill at another festival, to which she had been invited for\r\nthat purpose. But all which she had presaged, either concerning the\r\npublic or individuals, came truly to pass.\"\r\n\r\nThe above narrative is taken from the Saga of Erick Randa, as quoted by\r\nthe learned Bartholine in his curious work. He mentions similar\r\ninstances, particularly of one Heida, celebrated for her predictions,\r\nwho attended festivals for the purpose, as a modern Scotsman might say,\r\nof _spaeing_ fortunes, with a gallant _tail_, or retinue, of thirty male\r\nand fifteen female attendants.--See _De Causis Contemptæ a Danis adhuc\r\ngentilibus Mortis, lib. III., cap. 4_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote II., p. 32.--PROMISE OF ODIN.\r\n\r\nAlthough the Father of Scandinavian mythology has been as a deity long\r\nforgotten in the archipelago, which was once a very small part of his\r\nrealm, yet even at this day his name continues to be occasionally\r\nattested as security for a promise.\r\n\r\nIt is curious to observe, that the rites with which such attestations\r\nare still made in Orkney, correspond to those of the ancient Northmen.\r\nIt appears from several authorities, that in the Norse ritual, when an\r\noath was imposed, he by whom it was pledged, passed his hand, while\r\npronouncing it, through a massive ring of silver kept for that\r\npurpose.[44] In like manner, two persons, generally lovers, desirous to\r\ntake the promise of Odin, which they considered as peculiarly binding,\r\njoined hands through a circular hole in a sacrificial stone, which lies\r\nin the Orcadian Stonehenge, called the Circle of Stennis, of which we\r\nshall speak more hereafter. The ceremony is now confined to the\r\ntroth-plighting of the lower classes, but at an earlier period may be\r\nsupposed to have influenced a character like Minna in the higher ranks.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote III., p. 101.--THE PICTISH BURGH.\r\n\r\nThe Pictish Burgh, a fort which Nora is supposed to have converted into\r\nher dwelling-house, has been fully described in the Notes upon Ivanhoe,\r\nvol. xvii. p. 352, of this edition. An account of the celebrated Castle\r\nof Mousa is there given, to afford an opportunity of comparing it with\r\nthe Saxon Castle of Coningsburgh. It should, however, have been\r\nmentioned, that the Castle of Mousa underwent considerable repairs at a\r\ncomparatively recent period. Accordingly, Torfæus assures us, that even\r\nthis ancient pigeon-house, composed of dry stones, was fortification\r\nenough, not indeed to hold out a ten years' siege, like Troy in similar\r\ncircumstances, but to wear out the patience of the besiegers. Erland,\r\nthe son of Harold the Fair-spoken, had carried off a beautiful woman,\r\nthe mother of a Norwegian earl, also called Harold, and sheltered\r\nhimself with his fair prize in the Castle of Mousa. Earl Harold followed\r\nwith an army, and, finding the place too strong for assault, endeavoured\r\nto reduce it by famine; but such was the length of the siege, that the\r\noffended Earl found it necessary to listen to a treaty of accommodation,\r\nand agreed that his mother's honour should be restored by marriage. This\r\ntransaction took place in the beginning of the thirteenth century, in\r\nthe reign of William the Lion of Scotland.[45] It is probable that the\r\nimprovements adopted by Erland on this occasion, were those which\r\nfinished the parapet of the castle, by making it project outwards, so\r\nthat the tower of Mousa rather resembles the figure of a dice-box,\r\nwhereas others of the same kind have the form of a truncated cone. It is\r\neasy to see how the projection of the highest parapet would render the\r\ndefence more easy and effectual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNote IV., p. 143.--ANTIQUE COINS FOUND IN ZETLAND.\r\n\r\nWhile these sheets were passing through the press, I received a letter\r\nfrom an honourable and learned friend, containing the following passage,\r\nrelating to a discovery in Zetland:--\"Within a few weeks, the workmen\r\ntaking up the foundation of an old wall, came on a hearth-stone, under\r\nwhich they found a horn, surrounded with massive silver rings, like\r\nbracelets, and filled with coins of the Heptarchy, in perfect\r\npreservation. The place of finding is within a very short distance of\r\nthe [supposed] residence of Norna of the Fitful-head.\"--Thus one of the\r\nvery improbable fictions of the tale is verified by a singular\r\ncoincidence.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote V., p. 197.--CHARACTER OF NORNA.\r\n\r\nThe character of Norna is meant to be an instance of that singular kind\r\nof insanity, during which the patient, while she or he retains much\r\nsubtlety and address for the power of imposing upon others, is still\r\nmore ingenious in endeavouring to impose upon themselves. Indeed,\r\nmaniacs of this kind may be often observed to possess a sort of double\r\ncharacter, in one of which they are the being whom their distempered\r\nimagination shapes out, and in the other, their own natural self, as\r\nseen to exist by other people. This species of double consciousness\r\nmakes wild work with the patient's imagination, and, judiciously used,\r\nis perhaps a frequent means of restoring sanity of intellect. Exterior\r\ncircumstances striking the senses, often have a powerful effect in\r\nundermining or battering the airy castles which the disorder has\r\nexcited.\r\n\r\nA late medical gentleman, my particular friend, told me the case of a\r\nlunatic patient confined in the Edinburgh Infirmary. He was so far happy\r\nthat his mental alienation was of a gay and pleasant character, giving a\r\nkind of joyous explanation to all that came in contact with him. He\r\nconsidered the large house, numerous servants, &c., of the hospital, as\r\nall matters of state and consequence belonging to his own personal\r\nestablishment, and had no doubt of his own wealth and grandeur. One\r\nthing alone puzzled this man of wealth. Although he was provided with a\r\nfirst-rate cook and proper assistants, although his table was regularly\r\nsupplied with every delicacy of the season, yet he confessed to my\r\nfriend, that by some uncommon depravity of the palate, every thing which\r\nhe ate _tasted of porridge_. This peculiarity, of course, arose from the\r\npoor man being fed upon nothing else, and because his stomach was not so\r\neasily deceived as his other senses.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote VI., p. 199.--BIRDS OF PREY.\r\n\r\nSo favourable a retreat does the island of Hoy afford for birds of prey,\r\nthat instances of their ravages, which seldom occur in other parts of\r\nthe country, are not unusual there. An individual was living in Orkney\r\nnot long since, whom, while a child in its swaddling clothes, an eagle\r\nactually transported to its nest in the hill of Hoy. Happily the eyry\r\nbeing known, and the bird instantly pursued, the child was found\r\nuninjured, playing with the young eagles. A story of a more ludicrous\r\ntransportation was told me by the reverend clergyman who is minister of\r\nthe island. Hearing one day a strange grunting, he suspected his\r\nservants had permitted a sow and pigs, which were tenants of his\r\nfarm-yard, to get among his barley crop. Having in vain looked for the\r\ntransgressors upon solid earth, he at length cast his eyes upward, when\r\nhe discovered one of the litter in the talons of a large eagle, which\r\nwas soaring away with the unfortunate pig (squeaking all the while with\r\nterror) towards her nest in the crest of Hoy.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote VII., p. 280.--THE STANDING STONES OF STENNIS.\r\n\r\nThe Standing Stones of Stennis, as by a little pleonasm this remarkable\r\nmonument is termed, furnishes an irresistible refutation of the opinion\r\nof such antiquaries as hold that the circles usually called Druidical,\r\nwere peculiar to that race of priests. There is every reason to believe,\r\nthat the custom was as prevalent in Scandinavia as in Gaul or Britain,\r\nand as common to the mythology of Odin as to Druidical superstition.\r\nThere is even reason to think, that the Druids never occupied any part\r\nof the Orkneys, and tradition, as well as history, ascribes the Stones\r\nof Stennis to the Scandinavians. Two large sheets of water,\r\ncommunicating with the sea, are connected by a causeway, with openings\r\npermitting the tide to rise and recede, which is called the Bridge of\r\nBroisgar. Upon the eastern tongue of land appear the Standing Stones,\r\narranged in the form of a half circle, or rather a horse-shoe, the\r\nheight of the pillars being fifteen feet and upwards. Within this circle\r\nlies a stone, probably sacrificial. One of the pillars, a little to the\r\nwestward, is perforated with a circular hole, through which loving\r\ncouples are wont to join hands when they take the _Promise of Odin_, as\r\nhas been repeatedly mentioned in the text. The enclosure is surrounded\r\nby barrows, and on the opposite isthmus, advancing towards the Bridge of\r\nBroisgar, there is another monument, of Standing Stones, which, in this\r\ncase, is completely circular. They are less in size than those on the\r\neastern side of the lake, their height running only from ten or twelve\r\nto fourteen feet. This western circle is surrounded by a deep trench\r\ndrawn on the outside of the pillars; and I remarked four tumuli, or\r\nmounds of earth, regularly disposed around it. Stonehenge excels this\r\nOrcadian monument; but that of Stennis is, I conceive, the only one in\r\nBritain which can be said to approach it in consequence. All the\r\nnorthern nations marked by those huge enclosures the places of popular\r\nmeeting, either for religious worship or the transaction of public\r\nbusiness of a temporal nature. The _Northern Popular Antiquities_\r\ncontain, in an abstract of the Eyrbiggia Saga, a particular account of\r\nthe manner in which the Helga Fels, or Holy Rock, was set apart by the\r\nPontiff Thorolf for solemn occasions.\r\n\r\nI need only add, that, different from the monument on Salisbury Plain,\r\nthe stones which were used in the Orcadian circle seem to have been\r\nraised from a quarry upon the spot, of which the marks are visible.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[42] We may suppose the beads to have been of the potent adderstone, to\r\nwhich so many virtues were ascribed.\r\n\r\n[43] Like those anciently borne by porters at the gates of distinguished\r\npersons, as a badge of office.\r\n\r\n[44] See the Eyrbiggia Saga.\r\n\r\n[45] See Torfæi Orcadus, p. 131.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDITOR'S NOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) p. 17. Norna's soothsaying. The passage quoted by Scott from the\r\nSaga of Eric the Red may be read in its context in \"Vinland the Good,\"\r\nedited by Mr. Reeves, and published by the Clarendon Press. Eric was the\r\ndiscoverer of Greenland, and father of Leif the Lucky, who found Vinland\r\n(New England, or Nova Scotia?) about the year 1002. Leif has a statue in\r\nBoston, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n(_b_) p. 35. Islands \"supposed to be haunted.\" In De Quincey's\r\nautobiographical essay his sailor brother, Pink, describes the terrors\r\nof those isles. One of them, the noise of a Midnight Axe, is also found\r\nin Ceylon, in Mexico, and elsewhere. The Editor may be permitted to\r\nrefer to the legends collected in his \"Custom and Myth.\"\r\n\r\n(_c_) p. 47. Cleveland's song. Lockhart says that Scott, in his later\r\nyears, heard this song sung, and said, \"'Capital words! Whose are they?\r\nByron's, I suppose, but I don't remember them.' He was astonished when I\r\ntold him that they were his own in 'The Pirate.' He seemed pleased at\r\nthe moment, but said next minute, 'You have distressed me--if memory\r\ngoes all is up with me, for that was always my strong point.'\" This was\r\nin 1828. Mrs. Arkwright was the daughter of Stephen Kemble. She set\r\n\"Hohenlinden.\"\r\n\r\n(_d_) p. 86. \"Auld Robin Gray.\" In the Abbotsford MSS. is a long\r\ncorrespondence between Lady Ann Lindsay and Scott. She had known him as\r\na child. There was a project of editing all her poems, but perhaps her\r\nown modesty, perhaps the quality of the work, caused this to be dropped,\r\nand Scott only edited the ballad, with a letter of the lady's. This\r\nsmall quarto sells for some £5 when it comes into the market.
