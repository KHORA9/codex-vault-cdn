Thou wilt find something more in\r\n  woods than in books. Trees and rocks will teach what thou canst\r\n  not hear from a master.'\r\n                                                            St Bernard.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe recent publication in the daily press of instances of human\r\nlongevity under the heading 'Links with the Past' prompted a comparison\r\nbetween the length of time represented by the duration of a tree\r\nand the lifetime of a human being. The comparison of single lives\r\nsuggested the further step of contrasting the antiquity of the oldest\r\nfamily-histories with the remoteness of the period to which it is\r\npossible to trace the ancestry of existing members of the plant kingdom.\r\n\r\nMy primary object in these pages is not to deal with familiar cases\r\nof longevity in trees, but to consider in the first place some of the\r\nproblems connected with the origin of the present British flora, and\r\nthen to describe a few examples of different types of plants whose\r\nancestors flourished during periods of the earth's history long ages\r\nbefore the advent of the human race.\r\n\r\nIn dealing with plants of former ages we are confronted with the\r\ndifficulty of forming an adequate conception of the length of time\r\nembraced by geological periods in comparison with the duration of the\r\nhistoric era. Some of the 'Selections from the Greek Papyri' recently\r\nedited by Dr Milligan (Cambridge 1910) refer to common-place events\r\nin terms familiar to us in modern letters: we forget the interval of\r\n2000 years which has elapsed since they were written. Similarly, the\r\nclose agreement between existing plants and species which lived in\r\nremote epochs speaks of continuity through the ages, and bridges across\r\nan extent of time too great to be expressed by ordinary standards of\r\nmeasurement. Terms of years when extended beyond the limits to which\r\nour minds are accustomed cease to have any definite meaning. While\r\nthere is a certain academic interest in discussions as to the age of\r\nthe earth as expressed in years, we are utterly unable to realise the\r\nsignificance of the chronology employed. After speaking of the futility\r\nof attempting to introduce chronological precision into periods\r\nso recent as those which come into the purview of archaeologists,\r\nMr Rice Holmes suggests a method better adapted to our powers. He\r\nsays--'Ascend the hill on which stands Dover Castle, and gaze upon\r\nCape Grisnez, let the waters beneath you disappear; across the chalk\r\nthat once spanned the channel like a bridge men walked from the white\r\ncliff that marks the horizon to where you stand. No arithmetical\r\nchronology can spur the imagination to flights like these(1).' On the\r\nother hand, the use in some country districts in Britain of spindles\r\nalmost identical with instruments used in spinning by the ancient\r\nEgyptians, and similar survivals described by the author of a book\r\nentitled _The Past in the Present_(2), bring within the range of our\r\nvision an early phase of the historic era. The rude implements still\r\nfashioned by the flint-knappers of Brandon in Suffolk connect the\r\npresent with the Palaeolithic age. Measured from the standpoint of\r\nhistoric reckoning, survivals from prehistoric days appeal to us as\r\npersistent types which have remained unchanged in a constantly changing\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIn one of his essays Weismann quotes an old German saying with regard\r\nto comparative longevity, which asserts that 'a wren lives three years,\r\na dog three times as long as a wren' and so on in a regularly ascending\r\nseries: the life of a deer is estimated at three times that of a crow\r\nand an oak three times that of a deer, which means that, computed\r\non this basis, an oak lives nearly 20,000 years(3)! This fanciful\r\nillustration of the relative longevity of an oak is the expression of\r\na truth, namely the superiority of trees over animals in regard to\r\nthe duration of life. As a seventeenth-century translator of Pliny's\r\n_Natural History_ writes, 'In old times trees were the very temples\r\nof the gods: and according to that antient manner, the plaine and\r\nsimple peasants of the country, savouring still of antiquity, do at\r\nthis day consecrate to one God or other, the goodliest and fairest\r\ntrees that they can meet withal.' Oaks growing in Pliny's day in the\r\nHercynian forest are said to have been there 'ever since the creation\r\nof the world(4).' Sir Joseph Hooker, in an account of some Palestine\r\noaks, gives a drawing of a famous tree at Mamre, known as Abraham's\r\nOak, which is supposed to mark the spot where the Patriarch pitched\r\nhis tent(5). Examples such as these, though of no scientific value,\r\nserve to illustrate the well-founded belief in the extraordinary\r\nlongevity of trees. In the absence of evidence to the contrary, it\r\nwould be rash to deny the possibility that William the Conqueror's Oak\r\nin Windsor Forest, described by Loudon in his _Arboretum Britannicum_\r\nand mentioned by later writers, may be a survival from the reign of\r\nthe king whose name it bears. Although it is seldom possible to state\r\nwith confidence the exact age of old oaks and yews famed for length\r\nof days, there can be no doubt as to the enormous antiquity of\r\nmany of our trees whose years are 'sacred with many a mystery.' The\r\nsection of a trunk of one of the mammoth trees of California (_Sequoia\r\ngigantea_) exhibited in the Natural History department of the British\r\nMuseum, shows on its polished surface 1335 concentric rings denoting\r\nsuccessive increments of wood produced by the activity of a cylinder\r\nof cells situated between the hard woody tissue and the bark. It is\r\ngenerally assumed that each year a tree produces a single ring, though,\r\nas is well known, an estimate of age calculated on this assumption\r\ncannot be regarded as more than an approximation to the truth. If this\r\ngiant tree, which was felled in 1890, was then 1335 years old, it had\r\nalready reached an age of over two centuries when Charlemagne was\r\ncrowned Emperor at Rome. The concentric rings on a tree trunk owe their\r\nexistence to certain structural differences between the wood formed\r\nin the spring and in the late summer. In Sequoia, as in other members\r\nof the great class of cone-bearing trees, the wood is composed of\r\ncomparatively narrow elements which serve to carry water from the roots\r\nto the branches and leaves. As spring succeeds winter the inactivity of\r\nthe plant-machine is followed by a period of energetic life; opening\r\nbuds and elongating shoots create a demand for a plentiful supply of\r\nascending sap, and in response to this the tree produces a fresh\r\ncylinder of wood composed of relatively wide conducting tubes. After\r\nthe first rush of life is succeeded by a phase of more uniform and\r\ngentler activity, the demand for water becomes less exacting and the\r\nwood which is formed during the rest of the growing season consists of\r\nnarrower water-pipes. A period of rest ensues, until in the following\r\nspring new layers of larger tubes are laid down in juxtaposition to\r\nthe narrower elements of the latest phase of the preceding summer.\r\nThis alternation of larger and smaller tubes produces the appearance\r\nof concentric rings on a cross-section of a tree. It is not the pause\r\nin the active life of the plant which is responsible for the effect\r\nof rings, but the fact that the wood produced immediately before and\r\nimmediately after the pause is not structurally identical. In trees\r\ngrown under the more uniform conditions of certain tropical regions,\r\nthe annual rings are either feebly developed or absent; for example, in\r\nsome Indian oaks the wood shows no concentric rings of growth.\r\n\r\nStated in general terms, rings of growth in the wood of a tree are\r\nthe expression of a power possessed by the plant of regulating the\r\nstructure of its component elements in response to the varying nature\r\nof the external stimuli. In certain circumstances, for example after\r\nthe destruction of the young buds by caterpillars, the tree makes a\r\nspecial effort to repair the loss by producing a new set of shoots.\r\nThis may be recorded by the occurrence of two concentric rings in one\r\nseason. An extreme instance of departure from the normal has recently\r\nbeen described(6) in which a tree of _Theobroma cacao_ (the cocoa\r\ntree), planted in Ceylon in the summer of 1893 and felled in January\r\n1901, after a life of just over 7 years, was found to have 22 rings in\r\nits stem. In this case the tree shed its leaves three times a year, and\r\neach break in the uniformity of its vital activities was registered\r\nby the apposition of what under ordinary conditions are spoken of as\r\nspring and late-summer wood. At Aden trees stated by natives to be\r\nvery old showed only five or six rings of wood, a fact connected with\r\nthe almost complete lack of rain and with the uniform conditions of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\nThe degree of accuracy to be allowed to estimates of age founded on\r\nthe number of 'annual' rings is, however, of secondary importance in\r\ncomparison with the enormously greater hold on life possessed by trees\r\nas contrasted with the higher animals. Early in the nineteenth century\r\nthe Swiss botanist A. P. de Candolle expressed the opinion that trees\r\ndo not die from senile decay, but only as the result of injury or\r\ndisease. Trees are constructed on a plan fundamentally different from\r\nthat underlying the structure of the highly complex human organism,\r\nand are thus endowed with a sort of potential immortality. It has\r\nbeen suggested that some of the large corals in the Red Sea which\r\nare still tenanted by living polyps may have been growing in the days\r\nof the Pharaohs. The coral polyp represents the growing portion of a\r\nlifeless mass of rock which is constantly extended by the activity of\r\nthe organism at the summit of each branch. Between a coral-reef and a\r\ntree there are many essential differences, but a rough analogy may be\r\nrecognised. A tree, unlike the higher animals, does not reach a stage\r\nat which the whole of its substance attains a condition of permanence\r\nand fixity. It consists of a complex branching-system in which each\r\nshoot increases in length by virtue of the youthful vigour of its apex:\r\nto a large extent the tree as a whole consists of lifeless material\r\nincapable of further growth, as is the case of the older portions of\r\na coral-reef; but the regular increase in girth of the trunk and its\r\nbranches demonstrates that this comparison is only partially true, and\r\nthat the power of growth in a tree is not confined to the extremities\r\nof the youngest shoots. The tip of every twig is composed of minute\r\ncells endowed with a potentiality of development like that which\r\ncharacterises the embryonic tissues of a seedling just emerged from the\r\nseed. In the course of its growth, each branch, by means of its living\r\nand dividing cells, contributes to the several parts of the complex\r\nmechanism of the tree. While the greater number of cells acquire a\r\npermanent form and lose the power of further development, there\r\nremains a cylinder of cells endowed with perpetual youth. This cylinder\r\nof living cells, known as the cambium, extends between the wood and\r\nbark from one end of the tree to the other: by its periodic activity it\r\nadds new layers of tissue each year and thus, by increasing the amount\r\nof conducting tubes for the transport of water and for the distribution\r\nof elaborated food, it enables the tree to respond to the increasing\r\ndemands which are the necessary accompaniment of increasing size. It\r\nhas already been pointed out that in the spring when the sap flows most\r\nvigorously the cambial cylinder produces larger tubes, and afterwards\r\nwhen the tree settles down to its normal life, these are succeeded by\r\nnarrower and stronger tubes. These later formed elements serve also\r\nan important mechanical purpose; by the strength of their walls they\r\nincrease the supporting power of the tree and enable it to sustain the\r\nadded burden of the annual increase in the weight and extent of its\r\nspreading branches.\r\n\r\nIt is the persistence of permanently juvenile tissue in certain regions\r\nof a tree, together with the remarkable power of repairing injuries\r\nand shedding effete parts, that constitute some of the most striking\r\ncontrasts between the higher animals and plants. The embryo oak in the\r\nearlier stages of development consists entirely of actively growing\r\ncells; by degrees differentiation of the embryonic tissues results\r\nin the localisation of regions of cell-production at the tips of\r\nthe elongating stem and root. These apical groups of cells are, in\r\nfact, portions of the embryonic organism which persist so long as the\r\nplant lives. This continuity between the growing tip of an old oak\r\nstem and the cells of the undifferentiated embryo affords one of the\r\nmost remarkable examples in nature of a link between the past and the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nIf we pass beyond the stretch of time represented by the life of\r\na single tree, a few successive generations suffice to carry our\r\nretrospect back to the days when forests of oaks, birches, and other\r\ntrees impeded the progress of the Roman invaders, and, a stage farther\r\nback, to the age of Neolithic man whose remains are occasionally\r\nfound in our heaths and moors and in the submerged forests round our\r\ncoast. The blocks of oak and beech, some of which are as sound as when\r\nfirst felled, recently discovered below the foundations of parts of\r\nWinchester Cathedral constructed at the end of the twelfth or in the\r\nopening years of the thirteenth century, are relics of Norman forests.\r\nIn the course of some excavations at Brigg in Lincolnshire in 1886 a\r\ndug-out boat was found nearly 50 feet long and from 4 to 5 feet in\r\nbreadth. The stem of the oak from which the canoe had been fashioned\r\nshows no sign of branching for a length of over 40 feet, a fact which\r\npoints to the growth of the tree in a forest where the race for light\r\ninduced the development of clean columnar stems. The Brigg 'dug-out,'\r\nnow in the Hull Museum, was discovered in an old alluvial valley of the\r\nAncholme river, formerly connected with the Humber, and it may be that\r\nit was used by Neolithic man as a ferry for river-service(7).\r\n\r\nFrom the period claimed by archaeologists we pass by gradual stages\r\ninto the domain of the geologist. As Huxley wrote, 'when even the dim\r\nlight of Archaeology fades, there yet remains Palaeontology, which...\r\nhas brought to daylight once more the exuvia of ancient populations,\r\nwhose world was not our world, who have been buried in river beds\r\nimmemorially dry, or carried by the rush of waters into caves,\r\ninaccessible to inundation since the dawn of tradition(8).' The length\r\nof time represented by a succession of long-lived individuals of the\r\nsame species becomes enormously extended when we pass to the history\r\nof families, and disinter from the sediments of other ages the remains\r\nof extinct types. As we descend the geological series familiar types\r\ngradually disappear, and through a succession of changing floras we\r\npenetrate to the fragmentary records contained in the older rocks until\r\nthe absence of documents sets a limit to our quest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. _Pinus sylvestris_ Linn, in the Black Wood of\r\nRannoch. (Photograph by Mr A. G. Tansley.)]\r\n\r\nThe Scots pine shares with the oak, the beech, the aspen, the yew,\r\nand several other trees the right to be included in the native\r\nflora of Britain. In the peat-beds of Scotland even up to 3000 feet\r\nabove sea-level the stumps of pines occur in abundance, and in many\r\nplaces recent researches have revealed the occurrence of successive\r\nforests of pines, oaks, and spruces separated from one another by\r\nthe accumulations of swampy vegetation(9). The spruce fir has long\r\nceased to be a member of the British flora, but in a few localities in\r\nthe Scottish Highlands patches of primeval pine forests remain. The\r\naccompanying photograph (Fig. 1), taken by my friend Mr A. G. Tansley,\r\nin the Black Wood of Rannoch in north-west Perthshire, shows a few\r\ntrees of _Pinus sylvestris_ growing in their native soil: the form of\r\nthe older tree (_A_) suggests comparison with that of a well-grown\r\nbeech such as we are familiar with in English plantations. This\r\nspreading dome-shaped habit seems to be a peculiarity of the Highland\r\ntree, and is one of the characters which have led some botanists to\r\nregard it as a variety (_Pinus sylvestris_ var. _scotica_) of the\r\nordinary Scots pine. Though it is doubtful if any relics of primeval\r\npine woods are left in England, abundant evidence of the former\r\nexistence of the Scots pine is afforded by the submerged forests\r\nexposed at low-tide on many parts of the English and Welsh coasts and\r\nat the base of some of the English peat moors. During the construction\r\nof the Barry docks on the north coast of the Bristol Channel a\r\nfew years ago, the exposed sections of peat and forest beds were\r\ninvestigated by Dr Strahan and by Mr Clement Reid. There is evidence of\r\na subsidence of the land to an extent of 55 feet since the formation of\r\nthe lower peat-beds containing oak, hazel, willow, and other trees. The\r\npine, unknown in Wales during the historic period, was recognised in\r\nthe Barry cutting. The occurrence of a polished flint implement assigns\r\na date to the uppermost portion of this old land-surface(10).\r\n\r\nIt is impossible within the limits of a small volume to discuss in\r\ndetail the evidence furnished by the records of the rocks as to the\r\nrelative antiquity of the different constituents of the present\r\nvegetation of Britain. In later chapters a few selected plants are\r\ndescribed which are pre-eminently ancient types. Before passing to the\r\nconsideration of the data on which the geological history of plants is\r\nbased, brief reference may be made to one of the most interesting and\r\ndifficult problems of botanical research, namely the history of the\r\nBritish flora.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF PLANTS\r\n\r\n 'No speculation is idle or fruitless that is not opposed to truth\r\n  or to probability, and which, whilst it co-ordinates a body of well\r\n  established facts, does so without violence to nature, and with a due\r\n  regard to the possible results of future discoveries.'\r\n\r\n                                                     Sir Joseph Hooker.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the vegetation of the British Isles the leading _rôle_ is played\r\nby that large group to which the term Flowering Plants is frequently\r\napplied. This group, including the two sub-divisions Dicotyledons\r\nand Monocotyledons, is known by the name Angiosperms, a designation\r\ndenoting the important fact that the seeds are developed in an ovary\r\nor protective seed-case (ἁγγειον, a vessel or box). The fact that\r\nthese highly elaborated products of development made their appearance,\r\nso far as we know, at a comparatively late stage in the history of\r\nthe plant-world, attests their efficiency as a class and demonstrates\r\nthe rapidity with which they have overspread the surface of the earth\r\nas successful competitors in the struggle for existence. As Darwin\r\nwrote in a letter to Sir Joseph Hooker in 1881, 'Nothing is more\r\nextraordinary in the history of the vegetable kingdom, as it seems to\r\nme, than the _apparently_ very sudden or abrupt development of the\r\nhigher plants(11).' In another letter (1879) to the same friend we\r\nread, 'The rapid development as far as we can judge of all the higher\r\nplants within recent geological times is an abominable mystery(12).'\r\nMaking allowance for the probability, or indeed certainty, that the\r\nimperfection of the geological record tends to exaggerate the apparent\r\nsuddenness of the appearance of this vigorous class, and allowing for\r\nthe fact that our knowledge of the records of the rocks in which the\r\nhighest plants first occur is very incomplete, we cannot escape from\r\nthe conclusion that this recently evolved group spread with amazing\r\nrapidity. Various reasons may be suggested in explanation of the\r\ndominant position which the Angiosperms hold in the floras of the\r\nworld. As an instance of their rapid increase during the Cretaceous\r\nepoch[1], the period which has furnished the earliest satisfactory\r\nrecords of Flowering Plants, the following statement by an American\r\nwriter may be quoted:--'The rapidity with which it [_i.e._ the group of\r\nFlowering Plants] advanced, conquering or supplanting all rivals, may\r\nbe better understood when we remember that it forms 85% of the flora\r\nof the Dakota group '; that is a series of sedimentary rocks in Dakota\r\nreferred by geologists to the middle of the Cretaceous period(13). In\r\nthe Wealden rocks of England, which are rich in the remains of Lower\r\nCretaceous plants, no undoubted Flowering Plant has so far been found.\r\n\r\n[1] For the position of the Cretaceous and other systems in the\r\ngeological series, see the table on page 42.\r\n\r\nThe more efficient protection of the ovules, the germs which, after\r\nfertilisation, become the seeds, the extraordinary variety in the\r\nfloral mechanisms for assisting cross-pollination, the arrangements\r\nfor nursing the embryo, and the structural features of the wood in\r\nrelation both to rapid transport of water and to the storage of food,\r\nare factors which have probably contributed to the success of the\r\nAngiosperms. The degree of weight to assign to each contributing cause\r\ncannot as yet be satisfactorily determined, but the general question\r\nraised by the recent origin of these latest products of evolution\r\noffers a promising field for work. While admitting our inability\r\nat present to do more than suggest possibilities, we may encourage\r\nresearch by speculation.\r\n\r\nThe members of the Vegetable Kingdom placed next to the Flowering\r\nPlants are the Gymnosperms or naked-seeded (γυμνὁς, naked) plants,\r\nincluding (i) the Conifers, _e.g._ pines, firs, larches, the yew,\r\netc., (ii) a small group of plants known as the Cycads, whose\r\nexisting members, now almost confined to a few tropical regions, are\r\nthe descendants of a vigorous race represented by many species in the\r\nfloras of the Mesozoic epoch. A third sub-division of the Gymnosperms,\r\nthe Ginkgoales, is represented by a single survivor, which is described\r\nin a later chapter as one of the most remarkable links with the past in\r\nthe plant kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe Gymnosperms are geologically very much older than the Angiosperms.\r\nMembers of this class played a prominent part in the vegetation of\r\nthe Coal age and it is certain that they existed in the still older\r\nDevonian period. The only other group to which reference is made in\r\nlater chapters is that of the Ferns, one of the sub-divisions of a\r\nlarge class known as the Vascular Cryptogams or Pteridophyta. These\r\nplants, like the Gymnosperms, are represented in the oldest floras of\r\nwhich recognisable remains have been preserved. The main groups of the\r\nvegetable kingdom, founded on existing plants, are distinguished by\r\nwell-defined differences; they are comparable with separate twigs of a\r\ntree springing from larger branches and these again uniting below in\r\na common trunk. The vegetation of to-day represents only the terminal\r\nportions of the upper branches. As we descend the geological series,\r\nrecords of extinct types are found which enable us either to trace\r\nthe separate branches to a common origin or to recognise a convergence\r\ntowards a common stock. Were a botanist to find himself in a forest of\r\nthe Coal age he would experience great difficulty in assigning some\r\nof the plants to their systematic position: characters now regarded\r\nas distinguishing features of distinct groups would be met with in\r\ncombination in a single individual. It is by the discovery of such\r\ngeneralised types, which serve as finger-posts pointing the way to\r\nlines of evolution, that the student of pre-existing plants has been\r\nable to throw light on the relative antiquity of existing forms, and\r\nto trace towards a common ancestry plants which now show but little\r\nindication of consanguinity.\r\n\r\nConfining our attention to the dominant group of plants in the British\r\nflora, namely the Flowering Plants, we may profitably consider the\r\nquestion, though we cannot satisfactorily answer it,--which members of\r\nthis group are entitled to be regarded as the most ancient inhabitants?\r\nThe past history of our native plants, and their geographical range,\r\nnot only in the British Isles but on the Continent of Europe, are\r\nsubjects well worthy of the attention of field-botanists whose\r\ninterests are apt to be confined within too narrow bounds. There are\r\nnumerous problems relating to the composition of the present vegetation\r\nof Britain which might be discussed in reference to the relative\r\nantiquity of plants; but in a single chapter it is impossible to do\r\nmore than call attention to certain considerations which are frequently\r\noverlooked by students of British species.\r\n\r\nIt is customary to speak of the British flora as consisting for the\r\nmost part of species introduced into this country by natural means,\r\nwhile some plants owe their introduction to human agency or are\r\n'escapes' from cultivation. It is by no means an easy task in some\r\ninstances to decide whether a species is native or introduced, but\r\nin some cases, a few of which are mentioned, there is no doubt as to\r\nthe alien nature of the plants. The term 'native' needs a word of\r\nexplanation. It is not intended to convey the idea that a plant so\r\ndesignated came into existence on British soil and spread thence to\r\nother regions; but by native species we mean such as have reached this\r\ncountry by migration from other lands, or it may be in some instances\r\nhave actually originated in this part of Europe. One of the best known\r\naliens in Britain is the American water-weed, _Elodea canadensis_\r\n(or _Anacharis alsinastrum_), which was discovered about sixty years\r\nago in a canal near Market Harborough in Leicestershire(14). In all\r\nprobability this North American species was introduced into England\r\nwith timber. Once established, it spread through the waterways with\r\nalarming rapidity and became a serious pest. Elodea affords an\r\nadmirable instance of the serious interference with the balance of\r\nNature by the introduction of a new competitor into an environment\r\nconducive to vigorous development. Another foreign water-plant,\r\n_Naias graminea_, for the importation of which Egyptian cotton\r\nmay be responsible, has been recorded from the Reddish canal near\r\nManchester(15). This African and Asiatic species occurs in Europe\r\nonly as a colonist; it is said to have been introduced into Italy\r\nwith East Indian rice. A more recent case of alien immigration due to\r\nunintentional human agency is that of _Potamogeton pennsylvanicus_,\r\na pond-weed of Canada, the United States, Jamaica, and elsewhere.\r\nSpecimens of this species were first noticed in 1907 in a canal near\r\nHalifax close to the effluent from a cotton mill. Since its discovery\r\nthe plant has slightly extended its range. It is suggested by Mr\r\nBennett, who first identified the alien, that its fruits were brought\r\nto this country in goods from the United States(16).\r\n\r\nOf the introduction of these and other foreign plants we have\r\nsatisfactory records; but there are many others which may owe their\r\npresence to man's agency, though we have no information as to their\r\narrival.\r\n\r\nIt has long been recognised that several members of the British flora\r\nare related to Scandinavian species. The Scandinavian flora, as Sir\r\nJoseph Hooker says in his well-known paper on the 'Outlines of the\r\nDistribution of Arctic plants,' 'not only girdles the globe in the\r\nArctic Circle, and dominates over all others in the North Temperate\r\nZone of the Old World, but intrudes conspicuously into every other\r\ntemperate flora, whether in the northern or southern hemisphere, or on\r\nthe Alps of tropical countries'(17). The view generally held is that\r\nduring the Glacial period this Arctic flora was driven South, and aided\r\nby land-bridges, which were afterwards submerged, many of the northern\r\nmigrants found a more congenial home in Britain. It is however by no\r\nmeans improbable that this conclusion may have to be considerably\r\nmodified. Mr and Mrs Reid, as the result of their careful analysis\r\nof the Pre-Glacial Flora of Britain, express the opinion that 'the\r\npre-glacial plants suggest climatic conditions almost identical with\r\nthose now existing, though slightly warmer' (27, 2). It is noteworthy\r\nthat the list of plants given in their paper does not include any\r\ntypical Arctic species. The occurrence on the mountains of Scotland\r\nand elsewhere of such plants as _Silene acaulis_, _Dryas octopetala_,\r\n_Saxifraga oppositifolia_ and other Saxifrages, _Rubus chamaemorus_\r\n(the Cloudberry), and the dwarf Birch illustrate the Arctic-Alpine\r\nelement in our flora.\r\n\r\nThe opinion is held by many Swiss botanists that their Alpine species\r\nhave in large measure been derived from non-glaciated parts of the\r\nPyrenees, that is from a region which was presumably able to retain its\r\nflora at a time when more northern lands were exposed to extreme Arctic\r\nconditions. My friend Dr Moss believes that some of the so-called\r\nScandinavian plants came to Britain from Central Europe after the\r\nretreat of the ice; if this view is correct it means that some at least\r\nof our Arctic-Alpine plants reached these islands by a southern rather\r\nthan by a northern route.\r\n\r\nInteresting examples of far-travelled northern plants recently\r\ndescribed by Professor Engler of Berlin afford additional illustrations\r\nof the general principles enunciated many years ago by Sir Joseph\r\nHooker. A species of flowering Rush, _Luzula spicata_ var. _simensis_,\r\noccurs at an altitude of 3600 metres in Abyssinia and on Kilimanjaro.\r\n_Luzula spicata_ is found in the whole of the Arctic and Subarctic belt\r\nin Scotland, Auvergne, the Jura mountains, and elsewhere. The species\r\nprobably began its career in the northern hemisphere where it grew\r\nabundantly on the higher ground in the Arctic Circle: it eventually\r\ntravelled along the North American Andes and appeared in Mexico under a\r\nguise sufficiently distinct to warrant the use of another name, _Luzula\r\nracemosa_. In an eastern direction it reached the Himalayas and is\r\nrepresented in Abyssinia by a closely allied form. From Abyssinia to\r\nKilimanjaro _Luzula spicata_ 'had to travel a long distance; but it is\r\nnot impossible that it either still exists or has existed previously on\r\na few of the high mountains between Abyssinia and Kenia, from which,\r\nhaving advanced to the Kilimanjaro, it again produced new forms....\r\nAt any rate, it is impossible to do without distribution of seeds of\r\nalpine plants by air-currents or by birds from one mountain to the\r\nother in explaining the history of distribution'(18).\r\n\r\nThe majority of British plants are identical with species in Central\r\nand Northern Europe: of these, some are among the most widely spread\r\nEnglish species, _e.g._ the Daisy and Primrose, while others, such as\r\nthe Oxlip (_Primula elatior_), are confined to the Eastern counties,\r\nand others, such as the Cheddar Pink (_Dianthus caesius_), are\r\nrestricted to Western counties.\r\n\r\nBefore considering a small section of the British flora which is the\r\nmost interesting from the point of view of origin, a short digression\r\nmay be allowed in order to call attention to the importance of a\r\nbranch of science which Darwin spoke of as 'that grand subject, that\r\nalmost keystone of the laws of creation, geographical distribution,'\r\nand in 1847 referred to as 'that noble subject of which we as yet\r\nbut dimly see the full bearing.' It was largely as the results\r\nof his study of distribution in the Galapagos Islands that Darwin\r\ndetermined to 'collect blindly every sort of fact which bears anyway\r\non what are species.' The acceptance of the view 'that each species\r\nwas first produced within a single region'(19), raises the subject of\r\ngeographical distribution to a far higher plane than it occupied in\r\npre-Darwinian days. Although most people are familiar with some of\r\nthe commoner means by which plants are able to colonise new ground\r\nthrough the adaptation of their fruits and seeds to various methods of\r\ntransport, the conception of a plant as a stationary organism tends\r\nto prevent due allowance being made for the comparative facility with\r\nwhich, in the course of successive generations, a species is able to\r\nwander from place to place. The individual animal is endowed with\r\npowers of locomotion enabling it to seek new feeding-grounds and to\r\navoid enemies; but with the exception of some of the simplest forms a\r\nplant cannot move--'le matin la laisse où la trouve le soir.'\r\n\r\nThe rate of travel may or may not be rapid, but in a comparatively\r\nshort time, if the conditions are favourable, a tree may spread over\r\na wide area. Mr Ridley, Director of the Botanic Gardens, Singapore,\r\nwrites as follows in reference to the rate of travel of one of the\r\ncommon Malayan trees (_Shorea leprosula_), which bears winged fruits\r\nparticularly well adapted to wind-transport: 'If we assume that a tree\r\nflowers and fruits at 30 years of age and the fruits are disseminated\r\nto a distance of 100 yards, that the furthest fruits always germinate\r\nand so continue in one direction, it will be seen that under such most\r\nfavourable circumstances the species can only spread 800 yards in 100\r\nyears, and would take 58,666 years to migrate 100 miles'(20).\r\n\r\nThere is, however, one type of distribution--what is called\r\ndiscontinuous distribution--to which special attention should be\r\ndirected on account of its intimate association with questions\r\nrelating to the past history of living organisms. Many examples might\r\nbe quoted from both the animal and plant kingdoms in support of the\r\nview that discontinuous distribution is a criterion of antiquity. When\r\nidentical or very nearly identical plants occur in regions separated\r\nfrom one another by areas in which the particular species is unknown,\r\nthe inference is either that the surviving individuals are remnants\r\nof a large number formerly distributed over a wider continuous area,\r\nor that in the course of evolution similar conditions in widely\r\nseparated areas led to the production of identical types. The former\r\nview is much the more probable: it is consistent with the conclusions\r\narrived at on other grounds as to the connexion between discontinuous\r\ndistribution and ancient lineage. The explanations of the widespread\r\noccurrence among different races of similar objects or legends afford\r\nan analogous case. As Dr Andrew Lang points out in _Custom and Myth_,\r\nit is held by some students that the use of the bull roarer--to cite a\r\nspecific instance--by different peoples denotes descent from a common\r\nstock, though he considers the more probable explanation to be that\r\nsimilar minds, working with simple means towards similar ends, might\r\nevolve the bull roarer and its mystic uses anywhere.\r\n\r\nThe Cedars of Lebanon afford an interesting example of discontinuous\r\ndistribution. They illustrate how a species, which may be assumed to\r\nhave originated in one region, in the course of its wanderings may\r\nundergo slight changes until, at a later stage when the plants have\r\ndisappeared from parts of the once-continuous area, the remaining\r\noutlying groups of individuals are spoken of under different specific\r\nnames. The cedars of Lebanon, known as _Cedrus libani_, occur as\r\nisolated groups on the Lebanon hills as outliers of the larger\r\nforests of the Taunus 250 miles distant. The African cedar, _Cedrus\r\natlantica_, is separated from the Lebanon cedar by a distance of 1400\r\nmiles. Approximately the same distance divides the Lebanon cedar from\r\nthe deodar, _Cedrus deodara_, which extends from Afghanistan along\r\nthe Himalayas almost to the confines of Nepal. Sir Joseph Hooker\r\nregards the three cedars as varieties of one species which once\r\nformed a continuous forest: he attributes the present discontinuous\r\ndistribution, in part at least, to the effects of a warmer succeeding\r\na colder climate. The less favourable conditions drove the vegetation\r\nof the lowlands to seek more congenial habitats at higher altitudes.\r\nIn this connexion it is interesting to find that in Algeria the cedar\r\nis confined to the higher ground where the snow lies long in the\r\nspring(21).\r\n\r\nThe Tulip Tree of North America and Central China affords one of\r\nmany examples of existing flowering plants which illustrate the\r\nclose connexion between present distribution and past history. The\r\ngenus Liriodendron, often cultivated in the south of England, is\r\nnow represented by two species, the best known of which--the Tulip\r\nTree, _Liriodendron tulipera_--extends from Vermont to Florida and\r\nwestwards to Lake Michigan and Arkansas. The leaves bear a superficial\r\nresemblance to those of the Sycamore, but are as a rule easily\r\ndistinguished by the truncated form of the apex; the specific name\r\nwas suggested by the tulip-like form of the flowers. Fossil leaves\r\nof Liriodendron are not uncommon in the Cretaceous rocks of Disco\r\nIsland in latitude 70° N., where they occur with other flowering\r\nplants which bear striking testimony to the mildness of the Cretaceous\r\nclimate in high northern latitudes. One of the associated flowering\r\nplants is a species of Artocarpus, described by Dr Nathorst as\r\n_Artocarpus Dicksoni_ which bears a close resemblance to _A. incisa_\r\nthe bread-fruit tree of the southern tropics of the Old World. Without\r\nattempting to deal fully with the past history of Liriodendron, it may\r\nbe confidently stated that the records of the rocks are consistent with\r\nthe idea of antiquity suggested by the present distribution of the two\r\nsurviving species.\r\n\r\nIslands such as Great Britain and Ireland, situated a short distance\r\nfrom a continent, contain many plants which are widely spread in\r\ndifferent parts of the world, together with a very small number\r\npeculiar to the British Isles though closely allied to species on the\r\nneighbouring continent or to plants farther afield. The occasional\r\nrecognition of species previously believed to be confined to Britain\r\ntends to reduce the short list of our endemic types.\r\n\r\nAn enquiry into the origin of an island flora involves a consideration\r\nof the data in regard to changes in level and relative distribution of\r\nland and water in the course of geological evolution. It is generally\r\nagreed that at no distant date, in a geological sense. Great Britain\r\nand Ireland were united to the continent. There is, however, another\r\nfact to reckon with, namely the prevalence of Arctic conditions in\r\nnorthern Europe when a thick sheet of ice spread over the greater\r\npart of the British Isles. There can be no doubt that the severity of\r\nthe climate during the Glacial period was such as to destroy a large\r\nproportion of the vegetation. The question is, were all the flowering\r\nplants destroyed or were some of the hardier species able to survive,\r\neither on the higher peaks which kept their heads above the level of\r\nthe ice or on the southern fringe of England beyond the ice-covered\r\nregion? It is impossible to give a definite answer: the probability\r\nis that nearly all the pre-Glacial species were destroyed, but it is\r\nnot impossible that some Alpine-Arctic plants escaped extinction,\r\nwhile others retreated to more southern and less Arctic areas by means\r\nof a land-connexion with France or crossed the intervening sea by\r\nocean-currents, by animal agency, or by wind.\r\n\r\nAlthough we possess but imperfect information as to the extent and\r\nduration of land-bridges between Britain and the continent, there are\r\nno special difficulties in the way of accounting for the presence\r\nof Scandinavian, Germanic, and other elements in the British flora.\r\nThere are, however, other and more difficult problems to consider in\r\nreference to a small group of flowering plants which are met with in\r\nthe west and south of Ireland, also, to a less extent, in Cornwall and\r\nin a few other localities in the south-west of England. In Connemara\r\nin the west of Ireland, where hard frosts are unknown and winter snows\r\nare rare, there are three kinds of Heath, St Dabeoc's Heath (_Daboecia\r\npolifolia_), the Mediterranean Heath (_Erica mediterranea_) and\r\n_Erica Mackaii_ which are not found elsewhere in the British Isles or\r\nin the whole of northern Europe, but reappear in the Pyrenees. The\r\nLondon Pride (_Saxifraga umbrosa_), another Pyrenean plant, grows\r\non the south and west coast of Ireland from Waterford to Donegal.\r\n_Arbutus Unedo_, the Strawberry tree, which flourishes in the Killarney\r\ndistrict of County Kerry and occurs in neighbouring localities, has\r\na wide distribution in the Mediterranean region. Devonshire and\r\nCornwall possess two other Heaths, _Erica ciliaris_, which extends into\r\nDorsetshire and occurs in north Brittany, and _Erica vagans_, both\r\nPyrenean species, while a Mediterranean plant. _Gladiolus illyricus_,\r\ngrows in the New Forest.\r\n\r\nIn 1846 Edward Forbes dealt with the problems presented by the\r\ndistribution of British plants in an essay which has exercised a\r\nfar-reaching influence. When Forbes published his work, comparatively\r\nlittle was known as to the possibilities of transport of seeds and\r\nfruits across barriers of water(22). His conviction that the known\r\nmeans of dispersal were insufficient to account for the presence of\r\nMediterranean or Lusitanian plants in Ireland led him to turn to\r\ngeology for a solution of the problem. He was thus led to put forward\r\nthe view that in the course of the Tertiary period when, as we know\r\nfrom palaeontological evidence, the climate of north and west Europe\r\nwas much warmer than it is now, and long-before the beginning of the\r\nclimatic changes which culminated in the Glacial period, there was a\r\nland-connexion between the west of Ireland and the south-west of the\r\ncontinent. Mr Praeger, whose work on the Irish flora is well known to\r\nsystematic botanists, agrees with the conclusions of Forbes, and sees\r\nin the Portuguese and Mediterranean plants 'relics of a vegetation\r\nwhich once spread along a bygone European coast-line which stretched\r\nunbroken from Ireland to Spain'(23). If this explanation is correct it\r\nentitles Arbutus, St Dabeoc's heath and other members of this southern\r\ngroup to be regarded as a very old section of our flora. There is,\r\nhowever, another side to the question: granting that a certain number\r\nof Irish plants were able to withstand the rigours of an Ice age, it\r\nis hardly likely that the strawberry tree and other southern types,\r\nwhich it is admitted flourish in the south-west of Ireland because of\r\nthe mildness of the climate, were of the number of those which endured\r\nan extreme Arctic phase. Moreover, if these Mediterranean species\r\nare survivals from the Tertiary period, if they have been isolated\r\nsince pre-Glacial days as an outlier of a southern flora, we might\r\nfairly expect that during the long interval between their arrival and\r\nthe present day new forms would have been produced closely related\r\nto, though not identical with, the parent types. This, however,\r\nhas not been proved to be the case. Darwin in speaking of Forbes'\r\nEssay in a letter to de Candolle in 1863 says that he differs from\r\nmost of his contemporaries 'in thinking that the vast continental\r\nextensions of Forbes, Heer, and others are not only advanced without\r\nsufficient evidence, but are opposed to much weighty evidence'(12).\r\nThe alternative view is to regard Arbutus and its compatriots as\r\npost-Glacial arrivals and not as survivals from a widely spread\r\nTertiary flora.\r\n\r\nA recently published account of the New Flora of the volcanic island\r\nof Krakatau furnishes an instructive and remarkable demonstration of\r\nthe facility with which a completely sterilised island, separated\r\nby several miles of ocean from neighbouring lands, may be restocked\r\nwith vegetation(24). In 1883 the island of Krakatau, then densely\r\ncovered with a luxuriant tropical vegetation, was partially destroyed\r\nby a series of exceptionally violent volcanic explosions. After this\r\ncatastrophe only a third of the island was left: the surface was deeply\r\ncovered by pumice and volcanic ash and no vestige of life remained. In\r\n1906 a party of botanists who spent a few hours on Krakatau collected\r\n137 species of plants: the vegetation was in places so dense that it\r\nwas with the greatest difficulty they penetrated beyond the coastal\r\nbelt, and some of the trees had reached a height of 50 feet. The seeds\r\nand fruits of this new flora have been carried by ocean-currents,\r\nby wind, and by the agency of birds from other islands in the Malay\r\nArchipelago. The nearest islands, except the small island of Sebesi,\r\nabout 12 miles distant, are Java and Sumatra, separated from Krakatau\r\nby a stretch of water about 25 miles in breadth. It is reasonable to\r\nwonder whether, had Forbes known of this and similar modern instances\r\nof the capabilities of plants as travellers, he would have adopted the\r\nview he did. In this connexion it may be added that in recent years the\r\nglaciation of Ireland has been shown to be more extensive than it was\r\nbelieved to be when Forbes wrote his essay.\r\n\r\nThere would seem to be no insuperable objection to the conclusion\r\nthat the Mediterranean plants in Ireland and in the south of England\r\nreached their present home after the retreat of the ice at the end\r\nof the Glacial period, and after Ireland became an island. A full\r\nconsideration of the problem is beyond the scope of this book, but\r\nI have briefly stated the case, not with the authority of an expert\r\nbut in order to draw attention to a particularly fascinating study in\r\nplant-migration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. _Eriocaulon septangulare_ With. West Connemara.\r\n(Photograph by Mr W. R. Welch.) ]\r\n\r\nIn a volume by W. Canton entitled _A Child's book of Saints_ a story is\r\ntold in which the presence in Ireland of Mediterranean species receives\r\na more picturesque explanation. The Monk Bresal was sent to teach the\r\nbrethren in a Spanish monastery the music of Irish choirs. In later\r\nyears Bresal longed for a sight of his native land, though he loved his\r\nhome and 'every rock, tree, and flower' in his adopted country. After\r\nreturning to Ireland, his thoughts reverted to Spain; 'it appeared\r\nto him as though he was once again in a granite nook among the rocks\r\nbeside the Priory'; he saw the ice-plant with its little stars of white\r\nflowers sprinkled with red (the London Pride) and a small evergreen\r\ntree from which he had often gathered the orange-scarlet berries\r\n(Arbutus). The Prior of the Spanish monastery 'with heavenly vision\r\nsaw Bresal gazing at the evergreen tree and the ice-plant, and turning\r\nto the trees blessed them and commended them to go and make real his\r\ndream. As Bresal brushed away his tears he saw with amazement at his\r\nfeet the ice-plant and hard by the evergreen tree.'\r\n\r\nThe plant represented in Fig. 2 is another British species which tasks\r\nthe ingenuity of students of plant-geography. This is the Pipe Wort\r\n(_Eriocaulon septangulare_), the sole representative in Europe of a\r\ncertain family of Monocotyledons: it flourishes in the west of Ireland\r\nand in the western islands of Scotland but nowhere else in Europe; it\r\nis native on the other side of the Atlantic in Canada and the northern\r\nUnited States of America. Mr Praeger in describing the striking mixture\r\nof species in the west of Ireland writes, 'The pool from which we\r\ngather the American Pipe Wort is fringed with Pyrenean Heathers. The\r\ncracks which are filled with the delicate green foam of the maiden hair\r\nare set in Bearberry and Spring Gentian; _Habenaria intacta_, far from\r\nits Mediterranean home, sends up its flower-spikes through carpets of\r\nmountain Avens; and St Dabeoc's Heath and the dwarf Juniper straggle\r\ntogether over the rocky knolls'(25).\r\n\r\nThe presence of Eriocaulon on the western edge of Europe may be\r\nattributed to migration in pre-Glacial days from North America by way\r\nof a land-connexion, of which Greenland and Iceland represent surviving\r\nportions. The opinion held by Forbes, and advocated by some later\r\nnaturalists, that the southern companions of Eriocaulon in the west of\r\nIreland are survivors from a Tertiary flora which have lived through\r\nthe Ice Age, is consistently extended to the Pipe Wort. On the other\r\nhand, before yielding to the temptation to regard these American and\r\nMediterranean species as links with the Tertiary period, we must be\r\nconvinced that the possibilities of post-Glacial introduction, even\r\nwithout the aid of land-bridges, have been exhausted. The Pipe Wort is\r\na botanical puzzle which affords a good example of the accession of\r\ninterest to field-botany effected by a knowledge of the distribution\r\nof the component members of the British flora. The problem of its past\r\nhistory suggests an experimental enquiry into the adaptability of its\r\nseeds to dispersal, and emphasises the importance of the co-operation\r\nof botanists and geologists in a common endeavour to trace the origin\r\nof British plants.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the Pipe Wort, mention may be made of three other\r\nAmerican flowering plants recognised in the Irish flora. _Sisyrinchium\r\nangustifolium_ recorded from the west of Ireland is native in temperate\r\nNorth America; the orchid, _Spiranthes romanzoffiana_, met with in the\r\nsouth and north of Ireland, is widely spread in Canada and the northern\r\nStates, while _Sisyrinchium californicum_, a native of California\r\nand Oregon, was discovered by Mr Marshall in marshy meadow-land near\r\nWexford(26). In the case of the more recently discovered American\r\nimmigrants, the possibility of human introduction must be borne in\r\nmind, though there are no special reasons for doubting that some, as in\r\nthe case of Eriocaulon, reached the Irish coast by natural agencies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE GEOLOGICAL RECORD\r\n\r\n 'All the Epochs of the Past are only a few of the front carriages,\r\n  and probably the least wonderful, in the van of an interminable\r\n  procession.'\r\n                                 J. B. Bury (_The Science of History_).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe portion of the earth's surface accessible to investigation is made\r\nup in part of accumulations of old sediments, some indistinguishable\r\nfrom the shingle, sand, and mud now in process of formation by the\r\nceaseless action of denudation; others have been hardened, gently\r\nfolded or violently contorted and so far altered by crust-movements\r\nas to render their sedimentary origin well nigh unrecognisable. It is\r\nthese sediments of former ages, the dust of lost continents, in which\r\nare preserved the majority of the fragmentary remains of plants and\r\nanimals, the flotsam and jetsam of successive phases of evolution.\r\n\r\nThe crust of the earth, as Darwin wrote, 'with its imbedded remains\r\nmust not be looked at as a well filled museum, but as a poor collection\r\nmade at hazard and at rare intervals'(19). It is from this imperfect\r\nrecord that we seek to discover the relative antiquity of the several\r\ngroups or genera of living plants, and in the structure of extinct\r\ntypes we endeavour to discover connecting links between divisions of\r\nthe plant kingdom which in the course of evolution have retained little\r\nor no signs of a common descent.\r\n\r\nSir Joseph Hooker in a letter to Darwin in 1859 speaks of his\r\n'conviction that we have not in a fossilised condition a fraction of\r\nthe plants that have existed, and that not a fraction of those we have\r\nare recognisable specifically'(12). Considering the nature of the\r\npalaeontological documents the wonder is how much they have taught us,\r\nand we may look with confidence to the results of future research in\r\na field of which the importance has only recently been appreciated.\r\nWith the strata of sedimentary origin are frequently associated igneous\r\nrocks, and in many continental regions, as in the majority of oceanic\r\nislands, the crust of the earth consists wholly of volcanic material or\r\nof rocks produced by the gradual solidification of molten magmas. Rocks\r\ncomposed mainly of carbonate of lime, such as limestones and chalk,\r\nbear witness to ocean beds or to sediments deposited on the floors of\r\ninland seas beyond the reach of land detritus where coral reefs were\r\nreared or the shells and other calcareous skeletons of animals supplied\r\nthe material for future land. In such rocks the remains of calcareous\r\nseaweeds are frequently recognisable and occasionally, as in the\r\nEnglish chalk, fragments of wood testify to transport from a distant\r\nland.\r\n\r\nWhile there is little difficulty in explaining the nature of much of\r\nthe earth's crust, in several parts of the world the strata are totally\r\nunfossiliferous and closely simulate crystalline rocks. In many cases\r\nit is believed that such strata represent ancient sediments which in\r\nthe course of ages have been reduced by metamorphic agencies to a\r\ncondition which has obscured or entirely obliterated all traces of\r\ntheir pristine state.\r\n\r\nSince the pioneer work of William Smith, who in the early days of the\r\nnineteenth century first realised the importance of fossils as aids to\r\nthe determination of relative age, geologists have devoted themselves\r\nto the task of correlating the sedimentary rocks of the world, using\r\nas criteria the order of superposition of the strata and the nature of\r\ntheir organic remains. The result has been to classify portions of the\r\nearth's crust into periods or chapters, which together constitute a\r\nrecord of geological evolution as complete as it is possible to obtain\r\nfrom the available data. The accompanying table shows the order of\r\nsequence of the epochs, which stand for terms of years of a magnitude\r\nbeyond our powers to grasp.\r\n\r\nThe division of geological history into larger and smaller periods does\r\nnot imply the recurrence of sudden revolutions; it is in some measure\r\ndictated by considerations of convenience, but more particularly by\r\nour ignorance of certain stages in the history of the world due to the\r\nimperfection of the record.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEOLOGICAL TABLE.\r\n\r\nShowing the position in the Geological Series of the strata referred to\r\nin this volume.\r\n\r\n  Tertiary (Cainozoic)\r\n\r\n    {  =Recent=          {  Superficial accumulations containing human\r\n    {    =Pleistocene=   {    remains (Metal age, Neolithic and\r\n    {                    {    Palaeolithic ages, Glacial deposits)\r\n    {\r\n    {  =Pliocene=           Cromer Forest-bed, etc.\r\n    {\r\n    {  =Miocene=            Absent from Britain.\r\n    {\r\n    {  =Oligocene=          Bovey Tracey beds, etc.\r\n    {\r\n    {  =Eocene=             London Clay, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Secondary (Mesozoic)\r\n\r\n    {  =Cretaceous=      {  Chalk\r\n    {                    {  Wealden beds\r\n    {\r\n    {                    {  Purbeck and Portland beds (Upper Jurassic)\r\n    {  =Jurassic=        {  Oolites (Middle Jurassic)\r\n    {                    {  Lias (Lower Jurassic)\r\n    {\r\n    {                    {  Rhaetic beds\r\n    {  =Triassic=        {  Keuper   \"   (Marls with rock-salt, etc.)\r\n    {                    {  Bunter   \"\r\n\r\n\r\n  Primary (Palaeozoic)\r\n\r\n    {  =Permian=         {  Red Sandstones, etc.\r\n    {                    {  Magnesian limestone\r\n    {\r\n    {                    {  Coal Measures\r\n    {  =Carboniferous=   {  Millstone Grit\r\n    {                    {  Carboniferous limestone\r\n    {\r\n    {  =Devonian=        {  Devonian limestones, etc.\r\n    {                    {  Old Red Sandstones\r\n    {\r\n    {  =Silurian=        {  Sandstones, shales,\r\n    {                    {    some limestone\r\n    {\r\n    {  =Ordovician=      {  Slates, sandstones,\r\n    {                    {    Volcanic rocks, etc.\r\n    {\r\n    {  =Cambrian=        {  Slates, Sandstones, etc.\r\n    {\r\n    {  =Pre-Cambrian=    {  Slates, Volcanic rocks, etc.\r\n    {    =or Archean=\r\n\r\nIn certain parts of the world, as for example the north-west Highlands\r\nof Scotland, the Malvern Hills, Scandinavia, and in many other regions\r\nin Europe and North America, geologists have recognised what they\r\nbelieve to be the foundation stones of the world. These Archaean\r\nrocks, which underlie the oldest fossiliferous strata, belong to a\r\nperiod of geological evolution from which it appears to be hopeless to\r\nobtain any light as to the nature of the contemporary organic world.\r\nThe earliest vestiges of life so far discovered exhibit a high degree\r\nof organisation, which unmistakably points to their being links in a\r\nchain extending far beyond the limits of the oldest Cambrian strata\r\nin which recognisable fossils first occur. The rocks of the Cambrian\r\nand Ordovician epochs, as represented by the grits, shales, slates and\r\nother sedimentary strata in Wales, Shropshire, the Lake district and\r\nelsewhere, though in places rich in the remains of animals, afford\r\nno information in regard to the land vegetation. From the succeeding\r\nSilurian epoch very little evidence has been gleaned as to the nature\r\nof the flora, and it is not until we come to the sedimentary rocks of\r\nthe Devonian era that records of plant-life occur in any abundance. The\r\nalmost complete lack of botanical data in the pre-Devonian formations\r\nis in part due to the fact that these older rocks consist to a large\r\nextent of marine deposits formed under conditions unfavourable to the\r\npreservation of plants. That the land-surfaces of the older Palaeozoic\r\neras supported an abundant vegetation there can be little doubt.\r\nThe relics of plant-life furnished by the Devonian and succeeding\r\nformations represent the upper branching-systems of a deeply rooted and\r\nspreading tree, the lowest portions of which have been destroyed or\r\nhave left no sign of their existence.\r\n\r\nIn descending the Geological series, we begin with superficial\r\ndeposits, such as peat and river-gravels found subsequently to the\r\nunderlying boulder-clay of the Glacial period. The remains of forest\r\ntrees preserved in the peat and in submerged forests round the\r\ncoast connect the vegetation of the historic period with that of the\r\nNeolithic age. At the base of the Pleistocene series, the name given\r\nto the latest chapter of geological history, we find evidence of the\r\nprevalence of arctic conditions in the widely spread boulder-clays and\r\nother deposits of the Glacial period.\r\n\r\nFrom deposits of post-Glacial date abundant plant remains have\r\nbeen obtained, but we cannot say with any degree of certainty what\r\nproportion of these plants remained in Britain during the Ice age,\r\nand whether the greater part of the vegetation, the relics of which\r\nhave been discovered in pre-Glacial beds, was destroyed or driven\r\nsouth by the advancing ice. We may briefly consider some of the more\r\ninteresting facts brought to light by the investigation of the fossil\r\nplants in the Lower Pleistocene and Upper Tertiary beds. It is mainly\r\nto the researches of Mr Clement Reid into the vegetation of Britain\r\nimmediately preceding the Glacial period, that our knowledge of this\r\nphase of the history of the British flora is due.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Pre-Glacial plants from Mundesley (A), Norfolk\r\nand Pakefield (B, C), Suffolk. (Photographs by Mr Clement Reid and Mrs\r\nE. M. Reid.) A. _Bidens tripartita_ Linn. (× 6); B. _Picea excelsa_\r\nLinn. (nat. size). C. _Stellaria holostea_ Linn. (× 12).]\r\n\r\nOn the coast of Norfolk in the neighbourhood of Cromer the sections\r\nof the cliffs reveal the existence of a succession of sands, clays,\r\nand gravels underlying Glacial deposits; this material was probably\r\nlaid down near the mouth of the ancient Rhine, which in the latter\r\npart of the Tertiary period flowed across a low area, which is now\r\noccupied by the shallow southern half of the North Sea(27). The\r\nplant-fragments found in these river-sediments indicate a temperate\r\nclimate. Among the plants of this pre-Glacial flora are many familiar\r\nBritish species, such as _Caltha palustris_ (marsh marigold), species\r\nof butter-cup, _Stellaria holostea_ (greater stichwort) (Fig. 3, C),\r\n_Bidens tripartita_ (bur-marigold) (Fig. 3, A), maple, hawthorn, the\r\nalder, hazel, the yew, Scots pine and numerous others. If, as is not\r\nimprobable, these pre-Glacial plants were swept away by the subsequent\r\narctic conditions, the great majority of them returned to their old\r\nhome when a warmer climate ensued. There are however some pre-Glacial\r\nplants, such as the spruce fir (_Picea excelsa_), a cone of which\r\nis shown in Fig. 3, B, the water chestnut, _Trapa natans_ (Fig. 4),\r\nand a few other species no longer represented in the British flora.\r\nThe genus _Trapa_ is a striking example of a flowering plant which\r\nhas disappeared since the Tertiary period from many parts of Europe,\r\nincluding England, most of Sweden, and from several regions in northern\r\nEurope. It still grows in a few localities in Switzerland and in some\r\nof the Italian lakes. In pre-Glacial times the water chestnut was\r\nwidely spread from Portugal and England in the west to Siberia in the\r\neast, and its hard four-pronged nuts have been recorded from many\r\npost-Glacial peat-moors in the north of Europe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. _Trapa natans_ Linn. (nat. size). From\r\nMundesley. (Photographs by Mr and Mrs Reid.)]\r\n\r\nFrom the so-called Cromer forest-bed and associated deposits on the\r\nNorfolk coast several pre-Glacial plants have been obtained, indicating\r\na temperate climate during this phase of the Pleistocene period. A few\r\narctic species, such as the dwarf birch and arctic willow obtained from\r\nthe deposits next above the Cromer forest-bed, herald the near approach\r\nof glacial conditions.\r\n\r\nIt may be remarked in passing that no satisfactory evidence has been\r\ndiscovered in Britain of the existence of man in this part of Europe in\r\npre-Glacial days: it is, however, believed that flints from Tertiary\r\nstrata on the continent show traces of human workmanship. As Sir\r\nEdwin Ray Lankester said in 1905, 'It is not improbable that it was in\r\nthe remote period known as the Lower Miocene--remote as compared with\r\nthe gravels in which Eoliths [primitive stone implements] occur--that\r\nNatural Selection began to favour that increase in the size of the\r\nbrain of a large and not very powerful semi-erect ape'(28).\r\n\r\nThough comparatively recent in terms of geological chronology, the\r\nremoteness, according to ordinary conceptions of time, of the Tertiary\r\nperiod is brought home to us when we endeavour to grasp the fact\r\nthat it was during this chapter in the earth's history that some of\r\nour highest mountain-ranges, such as the Alps, the Carpathians, and\r\nHimalayas were formed by the uplifting of piles of marine sediments.\r\nFrom Tertiary strata in the Isle of Wight, on the Hampshire coast, and\r\nin the London basin numerous fossil plants have been obtained, which\r\nafford convincing evidence of climatic conditions much more genial than\r\nthose of the present day. The presence of palm leaves and of a wealth\r\nof other sub-tropical plants in Lower Tertiary beds in England reveals\r\nthe existence of a flora differing considerably both from that in the\r\nuppermost Tertiary beds of Norfolk and from the modern British flora,\r\nbut closely allied to the present Mediterranean flora.\r\n\r\nThe basaltic columns of the Giants' Causeway and of the Staffa Cave,\r\nand the terraced rocks which form so characteristic a feature in the\r\ncontours of the Inner Hebrides, are portions of lava-flows, which in\r\nthe early days of the Tertiary period were poured out over a wide area\r\nof land stretching from the north-east of Ireland, through the Western\r\nisles of Scotland, the Faroë islands, to Iceland and Greenland. While\r\nin this northern region volcanic activity was being manifested on a\r\nstupendous scale, a shallow sea extended over part of what is now the\r\nsouth-east of England in which was deposited a considerable thickness\r\nof sedimentary material derived from the neighbouring land. In this\r\nupraised sea-floor, known as the London clay, which is exposed in the\r\nIsle of Sheppey and in many other localities, numerous fossil fruits\r\nand fragments of wood occur in association with marine shells. The\r\nfact that many of the fruits were ripe at the time of their entombment\r\nled some eighteenth century writers to assign an autumn date to the\r\nuniversal deluge. One of the Sheppey fruits may be mentioned as an\r\nespecially interesting sample of the early Tertiary flora, namely\r\nthe genus Nipadites, so named from the very close resemblance of the\r\nfossils to the fruits of the existing tropical plant Nipa. _Nipa\r\nfruticans_, sometimes described as a stemless palm because of the\r\nabsence of the erect stem which is usually a characteristic feature of\r\npalms, grows in brackish estuaries of many tropical countries (Fig.\r\n5, A): it has long leaves not unlike those of the date-palm and bears\r\nclusters of fruits as large as a man's head; a single fruit is two or\r\nthree inches long and its hard fibrous shell is characterised by four\r\nor five longitudinal ribs (Fig. 5, B). The fruits of Nipa, which may be\r\ncarried a considerable distance by ocean-currents without losing the\r\npower of germination, are constantly found with other vegetable drift\r\non the beaches of tropical islands. The discovery of fruits of Nipa (or\r\nNipadites), hardly distinguishable from those of the existing species,\r\nin Tertiary beds in England, Belgium, in the Paris basin, and in Egypt\r\naffords a striking instance of changes in the geographical distribution\r\nof an ancient plant now restricted to warmer regions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. _Nipa fruticans_, Thunb. A. On the coast of the\r\nMalay Peninsula. (Photograph by Prof. Yapp.) B. Head of fruits (1/5\r\nnat. size). From a specimen in the British Museum.]\r\n\r\nWhile the higher members of the Cretaceous system, as seen in the chalk\r\ncliffs and downs, represent the upraised calcareous accumulations on\r\nthe floor of a fairly deep and clear sea, the lower members testify to\r\nshallower water within reach of river-borne sand and mud. 'During the\r\nChalk period,' as Huxley wrote, 'not one of the present great physical\r\nfeatures of the globe was in existence. Our great mountain ranges,\r\nPyrenees, Alps, Himalayas, Andes, have all been upheaved since the\r\nchalk was deposited, and the Cretaceous sea flowed over the sites of\r\nSinai and Ararat'(29).\r\n\r\nThe Wealden strata, at the base of the Cretaceous system, as seen on\r\nthe Sussex coast, in parts of the Isle of Wight, in the Weald district\r\nof Kent and neighbouring counties, point to the existence of a lake\r\nover a portion of the south of England and of the English Channel. The\r\nremains of a rich Wealden flora have been collected from these Wealden\r\nsediments, notably from the plant-beds of Ecclesbourne near Hastings,\r\nin which, so far as we know, flowering plants played no part or at most\r\noccupied a very subordinate position. A few fossil leaves have been\r\ndescribed from rocks assigned to a Wealden age,--and from the older\r\nStonesfield Slate, of Jurassic age, a single leaf is recorded,--which\r\nseem to be those of Dicotyledons; but it is certain that even in the\r\nearly days of the Cretaceous period the present dominant group in\r\nthe plant kingdom was in its infancy and in many regions probably\r\nunrepresented. When we glance at the geological table and consider\r\nthat in all the floras from the Wealden down to the Devonian period,\r\nflowering plants played no part, we are able to appreciate the fact of\r\ntheir rapid development, referred to in a previous chapter, when once\r\nthis highest type had become established.\r\n\r\nThe rocks comprised in the Jurassic system extend from East Yorkshire\r\nto the coast of Dorsetshire; they consist of a succession of\r\nlimestones, clays, sandstones, and a few thin beds of impure coal.\r\nSediments of this age also occur, though to a much less extent, on\r\nthe north-east coast of Scotland and in a few places in the Inner\r\nHebrides. Many of the Jurassic strata contain only marine shells,\r\nand corals are occasionally abundant, though in the lower members of\r\nthe system in the cliffs near Lyme Regis and at Whitby fossil plants\r\nare fairly common. It is, however, from the middle Jurassic beds,\r\nin the cliffs between Whitby and Scarborough, and in some inland\r\nquarries in East Yorkshire, that we have obtained the richest Jurassic\r\nflora. Rivers from a northern land laden with sediment and carrying\r\ndrift-wood, leaves and other plant fragments, deposited their burden in\r\nan estuary which occupied the eastern edge of Yorkshire. Sedimentary\r\nrocks laid down towards the close of the Jurassic period in the island\r\nof Portland in the south and on the Sutherland coast in the north have\r\nfurnished valuable records of plant-life.\r\n\r\nThe passage from the Jurassic to the underlying Triassic system is\r\nformed by some shales and limestones in South Wales containing remains\r\nof fish and other marine organisms. These so-called Rhaetic beds are\r\npoorly represented in the British area, but on the continent of Europe\r\nand in other regions the sediments of this age bulk much more largely\r\nand have yielded a rich collection of plants. The rocks of the upper\r\ndivision of the Triassic system, as seen in the Midlands, point to\r\nthe prevalence of desert conditions; and in the grooved sand-polished\r\nsurfaces of granite in Charnwood forest we have a glimpse of a\r\nTriassic landscape. The salt-bearing strata of this period in Cheshire\r\nand Worcestershire suggest conditions paralleled at the present day\r\nin the Caspian and Dead-Sea regions. The vegetation of Britain, and\r\nindeed of the world as a whole, seems to have undergone but little\r\nchange during the enormous lapse of time represented by the sediments\r\ncomprised between the Wealden and Triassic periods. The Lower Triassic\r\nflora affords evidence of a change in the facies of the vegetation and\r\nprepares us for the still greater differences revealed by a study of\r\nthe Permian and Carboniferous floras. To the student of evolution these\r\nPalaeozoic floras are of special interest on account of the facts they\r\nhave contributed in regard to the descent and inter-relationship of\r\ndifferent branches of the vegetable kingdom.\r\n\r\nIt is by a patient study of the waifs and strays of the vegetation\r\nof successive phases of the world's history preserved in sedimentary\r\nstrata, that it has been possible to follow the history of many\r\nexisting plants and to establish links between the present and the\r\npast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF PLANTS AS FOSSILS\r\n\r\n 'Some whim of Nature locked them fast in stone for us afterthoughts\r\n  of Creation.'\r\n                                                                Lowell.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe failure of the earlier naturalists to grasp the true significance\r\nof fossils or even to appreciate their nature is an extraordinary fact\r\nwhen we consider the pioneer work which they accomplished in biological\r\nand geological science. The following extract from the writings of so\r\nenlightened a man as John Ray serves to illustrate an almost incredible\r\ndisinclination to admit what seems to us the obvious. He wrote:--'Yet\r\nI must not dissemble that there is a Phenomenon in Nature, which doth\r\nsomewhat puzzle us to reconcile with the prudence observable in all its\r\nwork, and seems strongly to prove, that Nature doth sometimes _ludere_,\r\nand delineates figures, for no other end, but for the ornament of some\r\nstone, and to entertain or gratify our curiosity, and exercise our\r\nwits. This is, those elegant impressions of leaves and plants upon\r\ncole-slate, the knowledge of which, I must confess myself to leave to\r\nmy learned and ingenious friend Mr Edward Lhwyd of Oxford.... He told\r\nme that Mr Woodward, a Londoner, shewed him very good draughts of the\r\ncommon female fern, naturally formed in cole.... But these figures are\r\nmore diligently to be observed and considered... Dr Woodward will have\r\nthem to be the impressions of the leaves of plants which were there\r\nlodged at the time of the Deluge'(31).\r\n\r\nThe Mr Woodward alluded to by Ray thus expressed his views on fossils\r\nin an _Essay towards the Natural History of the Earth_:--'The whole\r\nterrestrial globe was taken all to pieces and dissolved at the Deluge,\r\nthe particles of stone, marble, and all solid fossils dissevered, taken\r\nup into the water, and then sustained together with sea shells and\r\nother animal and vegetable bodies; the present earth consists and was\r\nformed out of that promiscuous mass of sand, earth, shells, and the\r\nrest falling down again, and subsiding from the water'(32).\r\n\r\nIn the later part of the seventeenth-century Steno, a Dane by birth and\r\nProfessor of Anatomy at Padua, by his recognition of the identity of\r\nthe teeth in a shark's head, which he had dissected, with some fossils\r\nfrom Malta known as Glossopetrae, established the true nature of\r\nfossils. He also recognised a certain orderly sequence in fossiliferous\r\nstrata, and in the opinion of Professor Sollas he is entitled to be\r\nconsidered the 'Father and Founder' of Geology(33).\r\n\r\nIt was by slow degrees that the early observers freed themselves from\r\nthe obsession that the remains of animals and plants in the earth's\r\ncrust bear witness to a Universal Deluge and are all identical with\r\nexisting species. The possibility that some of the fossil plants in\r\nEnglish strata might be more clearly related to forms now met with in\r\nwarmer regions was gradually realised. The publication of the _Origin\r\nof Species_ stimulated palaeontological research, and botanists as well\r\nas zoologists turned to the investigation of extinct genera in search\r\nof proofs of the doctrine of evolution.\r\n\r\nThe common occurrence of petrified wood in rocks of different ages\r\nis well known. Fossil stems are occasionally found in their natural\r\nposition of growth, the structural details being rendered permanent by\r\nthe deposition of siliceous or calcareous material from water drawn by\r\ncapillarity into the dead but still sound tissues. Petrified wood from\r\nUpper Jurassic beds is abundant in the Island of Purbeck; an unusually\r\nlong piece of stem may be seen in the small town of Portland fixed\r\nto the wall of a house. Some of these stems have been referred by an\r\nAmerican author to the Araucarian family of Conifers, but the structure\r\nis as a rule hardly well enough preserved to afford satisfactory\r\nevidence for identification. In his _Testimony of the Rocks_, Hugh\r\nMiller speaks of fossil wood from the upper beds of the Jurassic system\r\nin sufficient abundance on the beach at Helmsdale in Sutherlandshire to\r\nbe collected in cart-loads; it is still easy to pick up good specimens\r\non the shingle beach a short distance north of Helmsdale, and a recent\r\nmicroscopical examination showed that some specimens are pieces of an\r\nAraucarian tree.\r\n\r\nImpressive examples of petrified trees on a large scale are to be\r\nseen in the United States, in Arizona and the Yellowstone Park.\r\n(Frontispiece.) In the northern part of Arizona the country for over\r\nan area of 10 square miles is covered with tree trunks, some reaching\r\n200 feet in length and a diameter of 10 feet. The nature of the\r\nmineralising substance has given rise to the name Chalcedony Park for\r\nthis Triassic forest(34). A striking example of one of the Arizona\r\ntrees is exhibited in the British Museum and in a neighbouring case is\r\na splendid petrified stem, 9 ft. in height, of a conifer discovered in\r\nTertiary lavas in Tasmania(35).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. Section of the north face of Amethyst Mountain,\r\nYellowstone Park, including upwards of 2000 ft. of strata. The\r\nsteepness of the slope is exaggerated. (After W. H. Holmes.)]\r\n\r\nFigure 6 illustrates the preservation of a series of forests of\r\nTertiary age in the mass of volcanic sediments, 2000 feet in thickness,\r\nknown as Amethyst mountain, in the Yellowstone Park district. By the\r\nweathering away of the surrounding volcanic material the tall stems of\r\nthe trees are exposed in places on the mountain sides like the 'columns\r\nof a ruined temple.' The height of the river at the foot of the cliff\r\nis 6700 ft. above sea-level and the mountain rises to a height of\r\n9400 ft. above the sea. In the lower part of the section the volcanic\r\nstrata are seen to rest on a foundation of older rocks _A_, and these\r\nin turn were laid down on the eroded surface of a still more ancient\r\nfoundation, _B_(36).\r\n\r\nThe section as a whole affords a striking demonstration of the\r\nmagnitude of earth-movements since the last of these forests was\r\nburied below the surface of a sea in which the volcanic material\r\nwas deposited. The account of the Yellowstone Park section recalls\r\nDarwin's description in the _Naturalist's Voyage_(37) of snow-white\r\ncolumns projecting from a bare slope, at an altitude of 7000 ft. in the\r\nCordillera.\r\n\r\nThe abundance of drift-wood on the coasts of some countries at the\r\npresent day helps us to picture the conditions under which the remains\r\nof former forests have been preserved. In his _Letters from High\r\nLatitudes_, Lord Dufferin gives the following description of drift-wood\r\non the shores of Spitzbergen:--'A little to the northward, I observed,\r\nlying on the sea-shore innumerable logs of drift-wood. This wood is\r\nfloated all the way from America by the Gulf Stream, and as I walked\r\nfrom one huge bole to another, I could not help wondering in what\r\nprimeval forest each had grown, what chance had originally cast them on\r\nthe waters, and piloted them to this desert shore'(38). A photograph\r\nreproduced in Amundsen's book on _The North West Passage_ shows the\r\nbeach on the Alaskan coast strewn with drifted timber(39). For the\r\naccompanying photograph (Fig. 7) of the flood-plain of the Colorado\r\nRiver(40), I am indebted to Professor MacDougal of the Desert Research\r\nLaboratory at Tucson, Arizona, who in a recent letter writes, 'During\r\ntimes of high-water a thin sheet of flood covers the flat for many\r\nmiles and bears drift-wood so thickly that it is difficult to push a\r\nboat through it.' The drift-wood consists of poplar, willow, pine, and\r\njuniper, 'the last two have been brought from the upper river, from\r\nas far away as a thousand miles.' A picture such as this affords an\r\nadmirable example of the wealth of material available for preservation\r\nin a fossil state.\r\n\r\nIt is only in the minority of cases that the accidents of preservation\r\nof fragments of ancient floras have given us the means of investigating\r\nthe internal structure of the plant organs. It is far more frequently\r\nthe case that fossil plants are represented only by a carbonised film\r\non the surface of a piece of shale or other rock: the actual substance\r\nof the plant has been converted into a thin layer of coal, and though\r\nthe venation and other surface-features may be clearly revealed, the\r\ninternal tissues have been destroyed. If a lump of clay containing a\r\npiece of fern frond is heated, the result is an impression of the leaf\r\non the hardened matrix and a coaly substance in place of the plant\r\nsubstance. It is occasionally possible by detaching a piece of the\r\nblack film from a fossil, and heating it with nitric acid and chlorate\r\nof potash and then dipping it in ammonia, to obtain a transparent\r\npreparation suitable for microscopical examination of the cell-outlines\r\nof the superficial layer of the leaf or other plant-fragment. This\r\nmethod of examination, used by several students of fossil plants and\r\nwith conspicuous success by Professor Nathorst of Stockholm, often\r\naffords valuable aids to identification.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Flood-plain of the delta of Rio Colorado. The\r\nhills in the background are 25 miles distant. (From a photograph by\r\nProf. MacDougal.)]\r\n\r\nPieces of plants embedded in sandy sediment, if not preserved by\r\npetrifaction, that is by the introduction into the tissues of some\r\nsiliceous or calcareous solution, gradually decay and their fragmentary\r\nremains may be washed away by percolating water, leaving a hollow mould\r\nin the gradually hardening sediment, which is afterwards filled with\r\nsand or other material. The plant itself is destroyed, but a cast is\r\ntaken which in the case of fine-grained sediments reproduces the form\r\nand surface-pattern of the original specimen. The incrustation of\r\nplants by the falsely named petrifying springs of Knaresborough and\r\nother places illustrate another method of fossilisation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Flower of _Cinnamomum prototypum_ Conw.\r\npreserved in amber. × 10. (After Conwentz.)]\r\n\r\nPlants which owe their preservation to amber occur both as\r\nincrustations and petrifactions. This fossil resin occurs in Tertiary,\r\nCretaceous, and Jurassic rocks; the amber found in abundance on the\r\nBaltic coast near Danzig and occasionally picked up on the beach\r\nin Norfolk and Suffolk comes from beds of Tertiary age. Pieces of\r\nPine-wood have been described from the Baltic beds in which the tissues\r\nare perfectly preserved as the result of the conversion into amber\r\nof the resinous secretion which permeates their cells: in this case\r\nthe amber is a petrifying agent. More frequently the preservation is\r\ndue to incrustation; as resin trickled down the stems of the Tertiary\r\npines from an open wound, flowers and leaves, blown by the wind on to\r\nthe sticky surface, were eventually sealed up in a translucent case\r\nof amber. Though the actual substance may have gone, the mould which\r\nremains exhibits in wonderful perfection each separate organ of a\r\nflower or the delicate hair-clusters on the surface of a leaf. The\r\nflower represented in Fig. 8, a species of Cinnamon, is one of several\r\nspecimens described by the authors of a monograph of Tertiary plants in\r\nthe Baltic amber(41).\r\n\r\nThe fragments of plants preserved in nodules of calcareous rock\r\noccasionally met with in some of the Lancashire and Yorkshire\r\ncoal-seams are perhaps the most striking examples of the possibilities\r\nof petrifaction. By cutting sections of these nodules and grinding them\r\nto a transparent thinness, the most delicate tissues of Carboniferous\r\nplants are rendered accessible to investigation under the high power of\r\na microscope. As our attention is absorbed by the examination of the\r\ndetails of cell-structure it is easy to forget that the section has not\r\nbeen cut from a living plant, but from the twig of a tree which grew in\r\nthe forests of the Coal age. The preservation is such as to enable us\r\nnot only to describe the anatomy of these extinct types of vegetation,\r\nbut, by the application of the knowledge of the relation between the\r\nstructure of the plant-machine and its functions gained by a study of\r\nliving species, it is possible in some degree to picture the plants\r\nof the Coal period as living organisms and to see in the structural\r\nframework a reflection of external environment. The recognition in the\r\ngeneral architectural plan of the Palaeozoic plants, as in many of the\r\nfiner anatomical features, of the closest resemblance to plants of\r\nthe modern world produces an almost overwhelming sense of continuity\r\nbetween the past and the present.\r\n\r\nThe plants of the Palaeozoic period, though often differing\r\nconsiderably from those of the same class in the floras of to-day,\r\nexhibit a remarkably high type of organisation. Some of the most\r\nabundant trees in the forest of the Coal age are decidedly superior in\r\nthe complexity of their structure, as also in size, to modern survivals\r\nof the same stock. On the other hand, it must be remembered that\r\nMonocotyledons and Dicotyledons which now occupy the highest place in\r\nthe hierarchy of plants have left no sign of their existence in any\r\nof the Palaeozoic strata. The greater size of some of the Palaeozoic\r\nplants, and in some respects the more advanced stage of evolution which\r\nthey represent as compared with their nearest relatives of the present\r\nera, must be considered in relation to their more important and\r\nrelatively higher position in the plant-world than that which is now\r\nheld by their diminutive descendants. It is, however, impossible to get\r\naway from the conclusion that the oldest Palaeozoic flora of which we\r\nhave an intimate knowledge must be the product of development of an age\r\nwhich is represented by a chapter in the history of the plant kingdom\r\nat least as far removed from the beginning as it is separated from the\r\nchapter now being written. Examples might be quoted in illustration of\r\nthe risks attending the determination of fossils by means of external\r\nfeatures alone, but it may suffice to mention the case of a specimen\r\noriginally described as a fragment of a Cretaceous Dinosaur under the\r\nname _Aachenosaurus multidens_. By the examination of thin sections\r\nthis supposed bone was shown to be a piece of Dicotyledonous wood(42).\r\nThe methods of preservation of plants as fossils are numerous and\r\nvaried and the few examples selected give but an incomplete idea of the\r\nsubject: for a fuller treatment of fossilisation the reader is referred\r\nto more technical treatises (48 vol. I.).\r\n\r\nThe employment of fossil plants as 'Thermometers of the ages' is a\r\nbranch of Palaeobotany to which a passing allusion may be permitted\r\nthough it is only indirectly connected with the main question. As\r\none of the most interesting examples of changed climatic conditions\r\nrevealed by a study of fossil plants, reference may be made to the\r\nwealth of material collected within the Arctic circle. The problems\r\nsuggested by the discovery of plants in rocks of various ages in\r\nNorth Siberia, Spitzbergen, Franz Josef Land, Bear Island, Greenland,\r\nand in many other localities in the far north are too difficult and\r\nfar-reaching to be discussed in these pages. In the Cretaceous and\r\nTertiary strata of the west coast of Greenland and Disco Island from\r\n69° to 72° north latitude, to refer only to one case, a great number of\r\nplants have been obtained by several of the earlier Arctic explorers\r\nand more recently by members of one of the Peary Expeditions. At the\r\npresent day on the fringe of land on the western edge of Greenland\r\nwhich is not permanently covered with ice, a considerable number of\r\nherbaceous plants are able to exist and to produce seed during their\r\nconcentrated period of development; while trees are represented only\r\nby a few low-growing shrubs such as the dwarf Juniper. In places\r\naccessible to investigation beyond the ice-covered hills of northern\r\nGreenland the rocks have been shown to consist of Cretaceous and\r\nTertiary sediments containing fossil plants associated with seams\r\nof coal. From these beds numerous Dicotyledons have been obtained,\r\nsome of them almost identical with living species characteristic of\r\nsub-tropical or tropical countries. In the lowest of the Cretaceous\r\nseries no Dicotyledons have been found, but flowering plants are\r\nabundant in the higher Cretaceous rocks. Allowing for the fact that\r\nclosely allied species are often able to live under very different\r\nclimatic conditions, there can be no doubt that the Cretaceous\r\nand Tertiary floras of Greenland indicate an average temperature\r\nconsiderably higher than that which now prevails in the warmest parts\r\nof the British Isles.\r\n\r\nIn the far south a fairly rich Jurassic flora has recently been\r\ndiscovered by the members of a Swedish Antarctic expedition in Graham's\r\nLand in latitude 63°·15 S. and longitude 57° W., which in its general\r\nfacies bears a close resemblance to the Jurassic flora of Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nAlthough the great majority of the records of ancient plants are\r\ndifficult to interpret by reason of imperfect preservation and because\r\nof the frequent separation of leaves, stems, and reproductive organs,\r\nthe student who tries to piece together the _disjecta membra_ of the\r\nfloras of the past shares the opinion expressed by the late Marquis of\r\nSaporta,--'Si l'on s'attache à les déchiffrer, on oublie bien vite la\r\nsingularité des caractères, et le mauvais état des pages. La pensée se\r\nlève, les ideés se développent, le manuscrit se déroule; c'est la tombe\r\nqui parle et livre son secret.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nFERNS; THEIR DISTRIBUTION AND ANTIQUITY\r\n\r\n 'It has been shown that certain forms persist with very little\r\n  change, from the oldest to the newest fossiliferous formations; and\r\n  thus show that progressive development is a contingent, and not\r\n  a necessary, result of the nature of living matter.'\r\n                                                                Huxley.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ferns as a whole represent a section of the vegetable kingdom\r\nwhich traces its ancestry as far into the past as any group of plants.\r\nImpressions of leaves on the shales of the Coal-measures and on rocks\r\nof the earlier Devonian period are hardly distinguishable in form and\r\nin the venation and shape of the leaflets from the finely divided\r\nfronds of modern ferns. Until a few years ago these Palaeozoic fossils\r\nwere generally regarded as true ferns, and it was believed that ferns\r\nplayed a conspicuous part in the vegetation of the earliest periods, of\r\nwhich we have any botanical knowledge. Conclusions based on external\r\nform must frequently be revised in the light of more trustworthy\r\nevidence. It was shown in the later part of the nineteenth century by\r\nthe late Professor Williamson of Manchester, whose researches into\r\nthe plants of the Coal age shed a flood of light on the ancestry\r\nand inter-relationship of many existing plants, that some of the\r\nfern-like leaves which have long been familiar to those who search\r\namong the shales of the refuse heaps of collieries, were borne on\r\nstems differing in anatomical features from those of any known fern.\r\nThe investigation of the structure of the leaves and their supporting\r\nstems led to the recognition of certain extinct genera of Palaeozoic\r\nplants of exceptional interest, to which the term generalised type is\r\naptly applied. Associated with anatomical and other characters such\r\nas we now regard as the attributes of ferns, these plants exhibit\r\nother features not met with in modern ferns but characteristic of a\r\ngroup of seed-bearing plants known as the Cycads. Recent research has\r\nrevealed the existence of several such generalised types which, by\r\ntheir combination of characters now met with in distinct sub-divisions\r\nof the plant-kingdom, clearly indicate the derivation of Ferns, and\r\nCycads as we know them to-day, from a common stock. It was in the\r\nfirst instance by means of anatomical evidence--obtained by the\r\nmicroscopical examination of sections of petrified fragments of stems\r\nand leaves--that the generalised nature of these Palaeozoic plants was\r\nrecognised. Nothing was known as to the reproductive organs. Ferns as\r\nnow represented in the floras of the world are essentially seed-less\r\nplants. As the author of _Hudibras_ wrote:\r\n\r\n   'Who would believe what strange bugbears\r\n    Mankind creates itself, of fears?\r\n    That spring like fern, that insect weed,\r\n    Equivocally, without seed.'\r\n\r\nThe reproductive organs or spores borne on the fronds of a fern\r\nproduce, on germination, a thin green structure, known as the\r\nprothallus, less than an inch in length: this bears the sexual organs,\r\nand as the result of the union of the male and female cells, the embryo\r\nfern-plant begins its existence as a parasite on the inconspicuous\r\nprothallus, until after unfolding its first green leaf and thrusting a\r\nslender root into the ground, it starts its career as an independent\r\norganism[2]. In this life-cycle the seed plays no part.\r\n\r\n[2] The life-history of a Fern is clearly described by Prof. Bower in a\r\nrecent volume in this series.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that the absence of any indication of spore-capsules\r\nand spores, in the case of some of the supposed fern leaves from\r\nthe Coal-measures, caused some suspicion in the mind of an Austrian\r\nPalaeobotanist as to the right of such specimens to be classed among\r\nthe ferns. This opinion, based in the first place on negative evidence\r\nand but little regarded by other authors, has in recent years been\r\nproved correct. In 1904 a paper was read before the Royal Society\r\nby Professor Oliver and Dr Scott(43) in which evidence was brought\r\nforward pointing to the conclusion that one of these generalised plants\r\nbore true seeds. Subsequently Dr Kidston published an account of some\r\nspecimens of another of these Palaeozoic plants in which was actually\r\nshown an organic connexion between undoubted seeds and pieces of a\r\nfern-like frond(44). Without entering into further details, these and\r\nsimilar discoveries may be summarised as follows:--Many of the supposed\r\nFern-fronds of Palaeozoic age, particularly those characteristic of\r\nthe Coal-measures, are the leaves of plants which in their anatomical\r\ncharacters combined features now shared by true Ferns and by the\r\nCycads. The reproductive organs of these Palaeozoic genera differed\r\nwidely from those of existing ferns; the male organs, while not unlike\r\nthe spore-capsules and spores of certain ferns, recall the male organs\r\nof living Conifers and Cycads, and the female organs were represented\r\nby seeds of a highly complex form. These seed-bearing plants have\r\nbeen called Pteridosperms, a name which expresses the combination\r\nof fern-like features with one of the distinguishing attributes of\r\nthe higher plants, namely the possession of seeds. The ancestors of\r\nPteridosperms are as yet unknown; it is, however, reasonable to assume\r\nthat there existed in some pre-Carboniferous epoch a group of simple\r\nplants from which both Ferns and Pteridosperms were derived. In the\r\nforests of the Coal age true Ferns probably occupied a subordinate\r\nposition in relation to the Pteridosperms.\r\n\r\nThe question of the relationship between different families of recent\r\nferns and the older known fossil members of the group is beyond the\r\nscope of this book. Evidence has been discovered in recent years which\r\nwarrants the statement that, although none of those Carboniferous ferns\r\nwere generically identical with existing forms, they very clearly\r\nforeshadowed some of those structural features which characterise more\r\nthan one family of present-day Ferns. The records of the older Mesozoic\r\nformations afford abundant evidence of the existence of certain types\r\nof Ferns showing a very close resemblance to recent species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. _Osmunda regalis_ Linn. Fertile frond, (2/5 nat.\r\nsize.)]\r\n\r\nAn enquiry into the geographical distribution of living Ferns reveals\r\nfacts of special interest in connexion with the relative antiquity of\r\ndifferent genera and families. The wide distribution of the Bracken\r\nfern has already been referred to: it is abundant in Tasmania; its\r\nvigour in the island is well illustrated by Mr Geoffrey Smith's\r\nstatement that constant attention is necessary to keep it from invading\r\nnewly opened country(45). On Mount Ophir in the Malay Peninsula the\r\ncosmopolitan bracken occurs in association with the two genera Matonia\r\nand Dipteris, ferns which are among the most striking examples of links\r\nwith a remote past and have a restricted geographical range. With\r\n_Osmunda regalis_, the Royal Fern, the Bracken is conspicuous in the\r\nmarsh vegetation of the Bermudas; it flourishes on the Atlas Mountains,\r\nin the Canary Islands, in Abyssinia, on Mt Kenia, in British East\r\nAfrica, in the Himalayas, and is in fact generally distributed in the\r\ntropics in both the north and south temperate zones.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Fern (Fig. 9) is another British species with a wide\r\ndistribution; it occurs in Northern Asia and in North America; it is\r\ncommon in the Siberian forests and lives in several tropical countries,\r\nextending to Southern India and Cape Colony, and in South America it\r\nis represented by a closely allied species. Though at the present day\r\n_Osmunda regalis_ is one of the rare English Ferns, its occurrence in\r\nthe submerged forest-beds round our coasts and in pre-Glacial beds\r\npoints to its former abundance in the British area generally. The Royal\r\nFern is a member of a family now represented by two genera, Osmunda and\r\nTodea.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of _Todea barbara_, with its large spreading\r\nfronds and a short root-covered stem, which occurs in Australia and\r\nCape Colony, all the species of this genus are filmy ferns with\r\nsemitransparent fronds adapted to a moisture-laden atmosphere. The\r\nmaximum development of the genus is in New Zealand.\r\n\r\n_Todea barbara_ affords an instance of discontinuous distribution; it\r\nwas no doubt once widely spread in circumpolar regions and now survives\r\nonly in South Africa and in Australia.\r\n\r\nThere are satisfactory reasons for regarding the Bracken Fern, with\r\nits world-wide range in present-day floras, as a comparatively modern\r\nspecies now in full vigour. Its anatomical and other features are\r\nconsistent with the view that it is a late product of evolution, and\r\nas yet no indication has been given by the records of the rocks of an\r\nancient lineage. The Osmunda family, on the other hand, is undoubtedly\r\nan extremely old branch of the fern group. A comparison of the Royal\r\nFern with the Bracken shows that their stems are constructed on\r\nvery different plans, and we have good reasons for speaking of the\r\nstructural peculiarities of the former as those of a more primitive\r\ntype. Moreover, the discontinuous geographical range of some members of\r\nthe Osmunda family is in itself an indication of antiquity. There is\r\nanother point which may have a bearing in this question of antiquity,\r\nnamely the fact that the spores of Osmunda are green and do not possess\r\nthe powers of indurance inherent in the spores of the majority of\r\nferns which are not green. It has recently been contended by Professor\r\nCampbell of Stanford University that the delicate green spores of the\r\nLiverworts, plants closely allied to the Mosses, constitute an argument\r\nin favour of the antiquity of these plants(46). Certain Liverworts are\r\ncosmopolitan in their range, _e.g._ the genera Riccia and Marchantia.\r\n\r\nIf certain genera are widely distributed, notwithstanding the fact\r\nthat their reproductive cells, by which dispersal is effected, are\r\nill-adapted to withstand unfavourable conditions or to endure prolonged\r\ndesiccation, it would seem reasonable to conclude that their emigration\r\nhas been accomplished slowly and with difficulty. Ferns such as\r\nOsmunda, with green and short-lived spores, would thus be handicapped\r\nin competition with other genera provided with more efficient means of\r\ndispersal and better equipped for the vicissitudes of travel.\r\n\r\nThe inferences as to antiquity deduced from a study of the existing\r\nspecies of Osmunda and Todea receive striking confirmation from the\r\ntestimony of fossils. Some of the oldest known Palaeozoic ferns,\r\nthough differing too widely from the existing Osmundas and Todeas\r\nto be included in the same family, afford distinct glimmerings of\r\nOsmundaceous characters, which at a later period became individualised\r\nin the direct ancestors of the modern forms. Our knowledge of the\r\npast history of the Osmunda family has recently been considerably\r\nextended and placed on a firmer basis by the researches of Dr Kidston\r\nand Professor Gwynne-Vaughan. These authors have recognised in some\r\nexceptionally well-preserved fern-stems from Permian rocks in Russia,\r\nanatomical features which point unmistakably to close relationship with\r\nthe recent members of the family(47)(48).\r\n\r\nPassing higher up the geological series, fertile fern fronds with\r\nspore-capsules and spores practically identical with those of Osmunda\r\nhave been found in the Jurassic plant-beds of Yorkshire and in rocks of\r\napproximately the same age in many parts of the world. From Jurassic\r\nstrata in New Zealand a petrified fern-stem has been described\r\n(_Osmundites Dunlopi_), almost identical in structure with the\r\nsurviving species. Cretaceous and Tertiary examples of similar ferns\r\nmight be quoted; but enough has been said to establish the claim of the\r\nRoyal Fern and other members of the Osmunda-family to an ancestry which\r\npossibly extends even farther back than that of any other existing\r\nfamily of Ferns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. _Gleichenia dicarpa_ Br. (1/2 nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nA brief reference may be made to another fern now represented by\r\nseveral species widely disseminated in tropical and sub-tropical\r\ncountries. The genus Gleichenia occurs abundantly in the warmer regions\r\nof both the Old and New World. The fronds may usually be recognised\r\nby their habit of growth (Fig. 10); in several species the main axis\r\nis repeatedly forked and a small bud between the divergent branches\r\nof the forks forms a characteristic feature. The leaflets are either\r\nlong and narrow like the teeth of a comb or short and bluntly rounded.\r\nMoreover the anatomy of the creeping stem affords a ready means of\r\nidentification. We have satisfactory evidence of the occurrence of\r\nGleichenia in European floras during both the Jurassic and Cretaceous\r\nperiods. Numerous fragments of plants were obtained some years ago,\r\nnot far from Brussels, from the Wealden strata in which the famous\r\nskeletons of Iguanodon were discovered. Visitors to the Natural\r\nHistory Museum in Brussels are no doubt familiar with the skeletons of\r\nthis enormous herbivorous animal: in the same gallery are exhibited\r\nthe remains of the fossil plants from the Iguanodon beds. Some of\r\nthese fragments are pieces of fern fronds identical in form with\r\nthose of existing Gleichenias. The microscopical examination of some\r\nexceptionally well preserved fragments of Wealden stems discovered by\r\nProf. Bommer of Brussels enabled him to recognise the Gleichenia type\r\nof structure and thus to confirm the inconclusive evidence furnished\r\nby fragmentary leaves. The most interesting records in regard to the\r\nformer occurrence of Gleichenia in Northern Europe we owe to the late\r\nOswald Heer of Zurich, who has described many examples of Gleichenia\r\nfronds from rocks of Lower Cretaceous age in Disco Island on the west\r\ncoast of Greenland in latitude 70° N. The same type of fern is recorded\r\nalso from upper Jurassic beds in the north-east of Scotland, in the\r\nWealden rocks of Sussex, as well as from other European localities. It\r\nis clear that the Gleichenia-family, no longer represented in north\r\ntemperate floras, was in the Jurassic period, and especially in the\r\nearly days of the Cretaceous period, widely spread in Europe, extending\r\nwell within the Arctic circle. It may be that the original home of\r\nGleichenia was in the far North at a time when climatic conditions were\r\nvery different from those which now prevail. Gleichenia, like many\r\nother northern plants, retreated to more southern regions where, in\r\nthe warmer countries of the world, many species still flourish widely\r\nseparated in space and time from the place of their birth.\r\n\r\nThe ferns so far mentioned have a more or less extended distribution\r\nat the present day. In the case of _Pteridium aquilinum_, the\r\ncosmopolitan Bracken Fern, wide range would seem to be correlated\r\nwith comparatively recent origin; on the other hand, the facts of\r\npalaeobotany show that the wide distribution of Osmunda, a type of fern\r\nwhich differs in many important respects from members of the family\r\n(Polypodiaceae) to which the Bracken belongs, is not inconsistent\r\nwith an exceptionally ancient family-history. There are, however,\r\ncertain genera of ferns which afford remarkable examples of restricted\r\ngeographical distribution associated with great antiquity. The island\r\nof Juan Fernandez, 420 miles off the coast of Chili, the home for\r\nfour years of Alexander Selkirk (to whose adventures we owe Defoe's\r\ncreation of Robinson Crusoe), is interesting also from a botanical\r\npoint of view. The vegetation of this oceanic island, 20 square miles\r\nin area with basaltic cliffs rising to a height of 3000 ft. above the\r\nsea, includes more than 40 species of ferns, eight of which occur\r\nnowhere else. One of these endemic ferns is _Thyrsopteris elegans_, the\r\nonly representative of the genus; it is readily distinguished by its\r\nlarge and graceful fertile fronds, examples of which may occasionally\r\nbe seen on a plant of this species in the Royal Gardens at Kew: the\r\nsporangia are produced in circular cups which replace the ordinary\r\nleaflets on the lower branches of the frond and hang from the short\r\naxis like miniature clusters of grapes. It is noteworthy that among\r\nthe fragmentary remains of the fern vegetation of the Jurassic flora\r\nin England and in other parts of Europe specimens occur with fertile\r\nsegments practically identical with those of the Juan Fernandez\r\nspecies. Students of fossil plants are occasionally led away by the\r\ntemptation to identify imperfect specimens with rare existing species\r\nto which they exhibit a superficial resemblance, and this is well\r\nillustrated by the frequent use of the generic name Thyrsopteris for\r\nJurassic and Lower Cretaceous ferns which are too imperfect to be\r\ndetermined with any degree of certainty We have, however, satisfactory\r\ngrounds for the assertion that the Juan Fernandez fern affords a\r\nstriking confirmation of the truth of Darwin's dictum that 'Rarity,\r\nas geology tells us, is the precursor to extinction.' In this remote\r\noceanic island, for reasons which we cannot explain, there lingers an\r\nisolated type which belongs to another age.\r\n\r\nThe following passage, which forms a fitting introduction to an account\r\nof two other genera of ancient ferns, is taken from a description of\r\nan ascent of Mount Ophir in the Malay Peninsula by Dr A. R. Wallace\r\nin his well-known book on the Malay Archipelago:--'After passing a\r\nlittle tangled jungle and swampy thickets, we emerged into a fine\r\nlofty forest.... We ascended steadily up a moderate slope for several\r\nmiles, having a deep ravine on the left. We then had a level plateau or\r\nshoulder to cross, after which the ascent was steeper and the forest\r\ndenser till we came out upon the Padang-Batu, or stone-field.... We\r\nfound it to be a steep slope of even rock, extending along the mountain\r\nside farther than we could see. Parts of it were quite bare, but where\r\nit was cracked and fissured there grew a most luxuriant vegetation,\r\namong which the pitcher plants were the most remarkable.... A few\r\nconiferae of the genus Dacrydium here first appeared, and in the\r\nthickets, just above the rocky surface, we walked through groves of\r\nthose splendid ferns, _Dipteris Horsfieldii_ and _Matonia pectinata_,\r\nwhich bear large spreading fronds on slender stems, 6 or 8 feet\r\nhigh'(49).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. _Matonia pectinata._ A group of plants in a\r\nwood on Gunong Tundok, Mount Ophir. (Photograph by Mr A. G. Tansley.)]\r\n\r\nThe two genera Matonia and Dipteris afford exceptionally striking\r\nexamples of survivals from the past. Matonia is represented by two\r\nspecies, _Matonia pectinata_ (Fig. 11), which grows abundantly on the\r\nupper slopes of Padang-Batu in dense thickets on the rock faces where,\r\nas Mr Tansley states, its associates are a species of Gleichenia,\r\nDipteris, and a little _Pteridium aquilinum_ (Bracken Fern). _Matonia\r\npectinata_ occurs also on Bornean mountains at an altitude of over\r\n3000 ft. and descends to the coast on some of the Malay islands. The\r\nother species of the genus, _Matonia sarmentosa_, has so far been\r\nfound in one locality only, Niak, Sarawak, where it was discovered by\r\nMr Charles Hose. _Matonia pectinata_ has a creeping stem covered with\r\na thick felt of brown hairs bearing tall fan-shaped fronds divided\r\ninto numerous comb-like branches thickly set with narrow linear\r\nleaflets on which circular clusters of spore-capsules are sparsely\r\nscattered. In some respects Matonia is unlike other ferns; the fronds\r\nconstitute a striking feature, and the anatomy of the stem is still\r\nmore distinctive. In the form, development, and arrangement of the\r\nsporangia (spore-capsules)--organs which from the constancy of their\r\ncharacters have long been recognised as the most useful basis for\r\nclassification--Matonia exhibits distinctive features.\r\n\r\nIn order to emphasise the isolated position of the genus it has\r\nrecently been placed in a separate family, the Matonineae, of which\r\nit is the sole living representative. The restricted geographical\r\nrange of Matonia, considered in connexion with the clearly marked\r\npeculiarities in structure and form, leads us to expect other evidence\r\nin support of the natural inference that the genus is a survivor of\r\na once more vigorous and widely spread family. If Matonia were a\r\nrecently evolved type which has not spread far from its original home,\r\nwe should expect it to conform more closely than it does to other\r\nferns in the Malay region. Even assuming for the sake of argument\r\nthat variation may occur _per saltum_, and new forms may be produced\r\ndiffering in more than the finer shades of small variation from their\r\nparents, the peculiar features of Matonia are too pronounced and its\r\nindividual characteristics too obvious to warrant the assumption of\r\nrecent production. It is, however, from the testimony of the rocks that\r\nwe obtain confirmation of the opinion that these Malayan species are\r\nplants on the verge of extinction. In shales of Jurassic age exposed\r\non the Yorkshire coast at Gristhorpe Bay and in iron-stained rocks of\r\nthe same age between Whitby and Scarborough, well preserved leaves have\r\nbeen found agreeing in the shape of the frond, as also in the form of\r\nthe leaflets and of the groups of sporangia which they bare, with those\r\nof _Matonia pectinata_.\r\n\r\nThe exposure by a stroke of the hammer, on the fractured surface of\r\na rock picked up on the beach at Hayburn Wyke (a few miles south of\r\nWhitby), of a piece of fern frond which is unmistakably closely allied\r\nto the species described by Wallace on Mount Ophir, establishes a link\r\nbetween the Jurassic and the present era and presents a fascinating\r\nproblem in geographical distribution. These fossil Matonias are known\r\nto students of ancient plants as species of the genus Matonidium, a\r\nname adopted by a German botanist for specimens apparently identical\r\nwith those from the Yorkshire coast discovered in slightly younger\r\nrocks (Wealden) in North Germany. The same type has been found also in\r\nsediments of Wealden age on the Sussex coast. Other leaf-impressions\r\nagreeing closely with those of Matonidium have been obtained from\r\nthe Yorkshire Jurassic rocks and these are assigned to another genus\r\nLaccopteris, an extinct member of the family Matonineae. It is not\r\nmerely in the habit of the fronds and in the shape and venation of the\r\nleaflets that these fossil ferns resemble the existing species, but\r\nthe more important features exhibited by the spore-capsules supply\r\nadditional evidence. It has already been pointed out that the stems\r\nof Matonia are characterised by a type of structure unknown in an\r\nidentical form in any other recent fern.\r\n\r\nA few years ago Prof. Bommer discovered fragments of leaves and\r\nstems in Wealden beds a few miles from Brussels sufficiently well\r\npreserved to reveal the details of internal organisation. Some of\r\nthese fossils were found to possess structural features identical\r\nwith those of the Malayan species of Matonia. A full account of the\r\nfossil representatives of the Matonia family would be out of place in\r\na general essay on Links with the Past, but brief reference may be\r\nmade to some of the data which throw light on the geological history\r\nof the family. In strata classed by geologists as Rhaetic, a phase\r\nof earth-history between the Triassic and Jurassic eras (see p. 42),\r\nspecies of Laccopteris and allied forms have been described from\r\nseveral other countries; from Jurassic and Wealden strata examples of\r\nboth Laccopteris and Matonia have been found in Germany, Portugal,\r\nBelgium, Austria, and elsewhere. From rocks of Cretaceous age, higher\r\nin the series than the Wealden strata, well preserved impressions of a\r\nMatonidium have been discovered in Moravia. The Matonineae were widely\r\ndistributed in Europe during the Rhaetic and Jurassic periods, but, so\r\nfar as we know, the family did not survive in the northern hemisphere\r\nbeyond the limits of the Cretaceous period. It is noteworthy that, in\r\nspite of the preservation of the remains of Jurassic and Cretaceous\r\nfloras in many extra-European regions, notably in India, South Africa,\r\nAustralia, China, and Tonkin, no specimens have been found which can\r\nwith confidence be assigned to the Matonineae. A single fossil has,\r\nhowever, been described from Queensland which may be a piece of a\r\nLaccopteris frond.\r\n\r\nThere is some evidence that ferns very similar to Matonia existed\r\nin North America during the Mesozoic period. It would be in the\r\nhighest degree rash to assume that the Matonineae played no part in\r\nthe Jurassic vegetation of India, South Africa, and other southern\r\nlands, but there can be little doubt that the family was especially\r\ncharacteristic of European floras during a portion of the Mesozoic era.\r\nIt would seem that subsequent to the Wealden period the ancestors of\r\nMatonia dwindled in numbers and their geographical range became much\r\nmore restricted.\r\n\r\nThe records of Tertiary rocks have hitherto added nothing to our\r\nknowledge of the distribution of the family subsequent to the\r\nCretaceous period. All we can say is that the existing species of\r\nMatonia are the last survivors of a family which in the Jurassic period\r\noverspread a wide area in Europe and probably extended to the other\r\nside of the Atlantic. Exposed to unfavourable climatic conditions and\r\npossibly affected by the revolution in the plant world consequent\r\non the appearance of the Flowering Plants, the Matonineae gradually\r\nretreated beyond the equator until the two surviving species found a\r\nlast retreat in the Malayan region.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12. _Dipteris conjugata_ Rein. and, in the middle\r\nof the upper part of the photograph, a frond of _Matonia pectinata_ R.\r\nBrown. Mount Ophir. (Photograph by Mr A. G. Tansley.)]\r\n\r\nThe fern spoken of by Dr Wallace as _Dipteris Horsfieldii_ (perhaps\r\nbetter known as _Dipteris conjugata_ (Fig. 12)), which grows with\r\n_Matonia pectinata_ on Mount Ophir and in the Malay region generally,\r\nis one of seven species of a genus characterised by a somewhat wider\r\ngeographical range than Matonia. _Dipteris conjugata_ extends to the\r\nPhilippines, Samoa, Fiji, New Caledonia, New Guinea and Central China;\r\nits fronds, like those of Matonia, are borne on long slender stalks\r\nattached to a creeping stem; they have a broad lamina divided by a deep\r\nmedian sinus into two symmetrical halves and each half is cut up into\r\nsegments with a saw-like edge. Several stout ribs spread through the\r\nlamina from the apex of the long stalk like the open fingers of a hand;\r\nfrom these ribs smaller veins are given off at a wide angle, and these\r\nin turn give rise to a reticulum of finer veins forming a skeletal\r\nsystem like that in the leaves of an oak and many other flowering\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nNumerous groups of spore-capsules are borne on the lower surface of\r\nthe broad lobed frond. The leaves of other species of Dipteris have\r\nthe same type of structure, but in some the segmentation of the lamina\r\nis carried further and the leaf consists of numerous long and narrow\r\nsegments with one or two main ribs. Dipteris is represented in the\r\nflora of Assam, and it is interesting to find that a species recently\r\ndiscovered in Borneo is more closely connected with the Assam type\r\nthan with those of the Malay region. Until a few years ago the genus\r\nDipteris was included in the large family Polypodiaceae of which\r\nnearly all our British ferns are members, but the discovery of certain\r\ndistinguishing features in the structure of the sporangia showed that\r\nthese Eastern and Southern species form a fairly well-defined group\r\nworthy of family rank.\r\n\r\nIn the Rhaetic plant-beds of Northern and Central Europe, of North\r\nAmerica, Tonkin, and elsewhere, numerous fossil leaves have been\r\ndiscovered which in shape, venation, and in the manner of occurrence of\r\nthe sporangia bear a close resemblance to species of Dipteris. Ferns\r\nof this type were abundant in the Jurassic floras of the northern\r\nhemisphere, and it is interesting to find impressions of Dipteris-like\r\nleaves both in the Jurassic rocks of the Yorkshire coast as well as in\r\nslightly newer beds of the same geological period on the north-east\r\ncoast of Sutherland.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say with confidence how nearly these Rhaetic and\r\nJurassic ferns were related to the existing species, as our knowledge\r\nof them is less complete than in the case of the fossil representatives\r\nof the Matonineae, but there can be no reasonable doubt that in\r\nDipteris as in Matonia we have a connecting link between the present\r\nand a remote past.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE REDWOOD AND MAMMOTH TREES OF CALIFORNIA\r\n\r\n 'Your sense is sealed, or you should hear them tell\r\n  The tale of their dim life, with all\r\n  Its compost of experience....'\r\n                                                          W. E. Henley.\r\n\r\n\r\nSince their introduction into England about the middle of the\r\nnineteenth century, the two Californian species _Sequoia sempervirens_\r\n(the Redwood) and _Sequoia gigantea_ (the Mammoth tree) have become\r\nfamiliar as cultivated trees. The name Sequoia, said to be taken\r\nfrom Sequoiah, the inventor of the Cherokee alphabet, was instituted\r\nin 1847, while the name Wellingtonia, often used in horticulture\r\nthough discarded by botanists in favour of the older designation\r\nSequoia, was proposed in 1853. Both species are now confined to a\r\ncomparatively small area in California: their restricted geographical\r\nrange, considered as an isolated fact, might be regarded as a sign of\r\nrecent origin. The records of the rocks, however, afford ample proof\r\nthat rarity in this as in many other instances is the precursor of\r\nextinction. The famous groves of Mariposa and Calaveras represent the\r\nlast resting-place of giant survivors of a race which formerly held its\r\nown in Europe and in other parts of the world.\r\n\r\nThe Redwood, _Sequoia sempervirens_, occupies a narrow belt of country,\r\nrarely more than 20 or 30 miles from the coast, three hundred miles\r\nlong from Monterey in the south to the frontiers of Oregon; it has\r\na stronger hold on existence than Sequoia gigantea. In Northern\r\nCalifornia it still forms pure forests on the sides of ravines and on\r\nthe banks of streams. The tapering trunk, rising from a broad base to\r\nover 300 ft., gives off short horizontal branches thickly set with\r\nnarrow spirally disposed leaves 1/4-1/2 inch in length arranged in\r\ntwo ranks like the similar leaves of the Yew. The lower edge of each\r\nleaf is decurrent, that is it runs a short distance down the axis of\r\nthe branch instead of terminating at the point of attachment. It is by\r\npaying attention to such details as this as well as to more important\r\nfeatures, that we are able to connect fragmentary fossil twigs with\r\nthose of existing species. The female 'flowers' have the form of oblong\r\ncones from 3/4 to 1 inch long: each consists of a central axis bearing\r\ncrowded wedge-shaped, woody appendages or cone-scales, which gradually\r\nincrease in breadth towards the exposed distal end characterised by its\r\nfour sloping sides and by a median transverse groove. Several small\r\nseeds are borne on the upper surface of the cone-scales. The smaller\r\nand short-lived male flowers need not be described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13, _Sequoia gigantea._ King's Co., California.\r\n(From Prof. D. H. Campbell)]\r\n\r\nThe other and better known species _Sequoia gigantea_ (Fig. 13) has an\r\neven more restricted range and is confined to groves on the western\r\nslopes of the Sierra Nevada between 3000 to 9000 ft. above sea-level.\r\n\r\nThis tree is at once distinguished from the Redwood by its ovate,\r\nsharply pointed and stiffer leaves which retain their spiral\r\ndisposition and closely surround the axis of the twigs like\r\nobliquely-set needles. The cones are of the same type as those of\r\n_Sequoia sempervirens_, but are broader and may attain a length of\r\n3-1/2 inches (9·5 cm.) (Fig. 14).\r\n\r\nReference has already been made to Sequoia as a striking illustration\r\nof longevity. It is also selected as an equally impressive example of\r\na type verging on extinction, which played a prominent part in the\r\nvegetation of both west and east during the Cretaceous and Tertiary\r\nperiods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14. _Sequoia gigantea_ Torr. (7/8 nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nScraps of branches with leaves hardly distinguishable from those of\r\nthe existing Californian trees are frequently met with in Tertiary\r\nand Mesozoic sediments, and with them occasionally occur cones too\r\nimperfectly preserved to afford satisfactory evidence of more than\r\nsuperficial agreement with those of the recent species. The task of\r\ndeciphering the past history of plants, particularly of the Conifers,\r\nis accompanied by many difficulties and insidious temptations. It is\r\nclear from a critical examination of many of the recorded instances\r\nof fossil Sequoias that the generic name has been frequently used\r\nby writers without adequate grounds. The fragmentary specimens\r\navailable to the botanical historian cannot as a rule be subjected\r\nto microscopical investigation, and even a partial acquaintance with\r\nthe similarity of the foliage of different types of living Conifers\r\nis sufficient to convince the student of the need of self-control in\r\nthe identification of the fossils. It is, however, easy to point out\r\nobvious pitfalls, though difficult to maintain a judicial attitude in\r\nthe excitement of endeavouring to interpret documents which are too\r\nincomplete to be identified with certainty. If we put on one side all\r\nrecords of supposed fossil Sequoias not based on satisfactory data,\r\nthere remains a wealth of material testifying to the antiquity of the\r\nsurviving species.\r\n\r\nIt is by no means improbable that Conifers closely allied to the\r\nRedwoods and Mammoth trees of California were represented in Jurassic\r\nfloras; but hitherto no proof has been obtained of the occurrence of\r\na Sequoia among the rich material afforded by the Jurassic plant-beds\r\nof Yorkshire and by beds of the same age in other countries. A small\r\ncone has recently been described from strata near Boulogne belonging\r\nto the latest phase of the Jurassic period, which presents a strong\r\nresemblance in shape and size and in the form of the cone-scales to\r\nthose of the recent species. This specimen, though not conclusive,\r\nis the most satisfactory indication of a Jurassic Sequoia so far\r\ndiscovered. From Lower Jurassic rocks in Madagascar similar cones\r\nhave been recorded in association with foliage-shoots like those of\r\n_Sequoia gigantea_, but here too the evidence is not beyond suspicion.\r\nIn plant-bearing strata of Wealden age, such as are exposed in the\r\ncliff near Hastings and in deposits of the same age in North Germany,\r\nPortugal, and elsewhere, twigs and cones have been found which may be\r\nthose of trees nearly allied to the genus Sequoia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15. _Sequoia Couttsiae_ Heer. Twigs (A) and\r\ncone-scales (B) from Bovey Tracey. (× 3.) (Photographs by Mr and Mrs\r\nClement Reid.)]\r\n\r\nIt is, however, in the sedimentary rocks of Cretaceous age, rather\r\nhigher in the series than those in the Hastings cliffs, and in the\r\nsucceeding Tertiary rocks, that undoubted Sequoias are met with in\r\nabundance. At Bovey Tracey in Devonshire there is a basin-shaped\r\ndepression in the granitic rocks of Dartmoor filled with clay, gravel\r\nand sand--the flood-deposits of a Tertiary lake containing waifs\r\nand strays of the vegetation on the surrounding hills. Among the\r\ncommonest plants is one to which the late Oswald Heer gave the name\r\n_Sequoia Couttsiae_, and his reference of the specimens to the genus\r\nSequoia has been confirmed by the recent researches of Air and Mrs\r\nClement Reid(50). This Tertiary (Oligocene) species is represented by\r\nslender twigs almost identical with those of _Sequoia gigantea_ and by\r\nwell-preserved cone-scales and seeds (Fig. 15). Moreover, it has been\r\npossible to examine microscopically the structure of the carbonised\r\nouter skin of the leaves and to demonstrate its agreement with that\r\nof the superficial tissue in the leaves of the Mammoth tree. With the\r\nBovey Tracey Sequoia are associated fragments of Magnolia, Vitis, and\r\n_Taxodium distichum_, the swamp Cypress of North America, together\r\nwith other types which have long ceased to exist in Western Europe.\r\nOther British examples of Sequoia have been described from Tertiary\r\nbeds at Bournemouth, the Isle of Wight, Sheppey, and Antrim, but the\r\nmaterial from these localities is inferior in preservation and cannot\r\nbe identified with the same degree of certainty as in the case of the\r\nDevonshire specimens. The occurrence of twigs and cones of several\r\nspecies of Sequoia in both Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks in Austria,\r\nGermany, Italy, France, and elsewhere, shows that the ancestors of the\r\nCalifornian trees were common in the European region.\r\n\r\nThe exploration of Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks in Arctic Europe\r\nhas revealed the former existence in Greenland, Spitzbergen, and\r\nother more or less ice-covered lands of plants which clearly denote\r\na mild climate. Cones and branches of Sequoias have been found in\r\nabundance in Lower Tertiary beds on Disco Island off the west coast\r\nof Greenland, and similar evidence of the northern extension of the\r\ngenus has been obtained from Spitzbergen. Dr Nathorst of Stockholm\r\nspeaks of twigs of Sequoia in the Tertiary clays of Ellesmere Land\r\nalmost as perfect as herbarium specimens. In Tertiary beds on the banks\r\nof the Mackenzie River, in Alaska, Saghalien Island and Vancouver\r\nIsland, and in Upper Cretaceous rocks in the Queen Charlotte Islands,\r\nremains of Sequoia have been discovered. One of the most remarkable\r\ninstances of the preservation of trees of a bygone age is supplied\r\nby the volcanic deposits of Lower Tertiary age exposed on the slopes\r\nof Amethyst mountain in the Yellowstone Park district. At different\r\nlevels in the volcanic and sedimentary material, which is piled up to\r\na height of over 2000 ft. above the valley, as many as fifteen forests\r\nare represented by erect and prostrate limbs of petrified trees (Fig.\r\n6). The microscopical examination of some of these trees has shown\r\nthat they bear a striking resemblance to _Sequoia sempervirens_. In a\r\nphotograph of these petrified forests by the U.S. Geological Survey\r\n(36, 2) one sees living Conifers side by side with the lichen-covered\r\nand weathered trunks of the fossil species (_Sequoia magnifica_),\r\nliving and extinct being at a distance hardly distinguishable.\r\n(Frontispiece.)\r\n\r\nIn concluding this brief survey of the fossil records of Sequoia,\r\nreference may be made to the discovery of petrified wood in Cretaceous\r\nrocks in South Nevada, possessing the anatomical features of _Sequoia\r\ngigantea_, which shows that close to the present home of the big trees\r\ntheir ancestors flourished during a period of the earth's history too\r\nremote to be measured by human reckoning.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of the Tertiary and Cretaceous Sequoias would appear\r\nto have been mainly in the northern hemisphere, extending well within\r\nthe Arctic circle. It is, however, by no means improbable that the\r\nancestors of Sequoia flourished far south of the equator. Reference has\r\nbeen made to Jurassic fossils from Madagascar which have been compared\r\nwith the existing species, and from Lower Tertiary beds in New Zealand\r\nthe late Baron Ettingshausen described some cones and twigs as _Sequoia\r\nnovae zeelandicae_ which bear a close resemblance to the existing\r\ntype. The available evidence would seem to point to a northern origin\r\nof the genus, though allowance must be made for erroneous conclusions\r\nbased on negative evidence. Further research may well extend the past\r\ndistribution of Sequoia in southern lands, but the data to hand point\r\nto the conclusion that the Californian trees represent the survivors\r\nof a type which flourished in the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods over\r\na wide area in North America and in what we now call the Continent of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE ARAUCARIA FAMILY\r\n\r\n  'And so the grandeur of the Forest-tree\r\n  Comes not by casting in a formal mould,\r\n  But from its own divine vitality.'\r\n                                                            Wordsworth.\r\n\r\nAs an additional illustration of existing cone-bearing trees which form\r\nlinks with the past we may briefly consider the genera Araucaria and\r\nAgathis, the two members of the family Araucarieae. It is generally\r\nagreed that the branches of the genealogical tree of this family\r\nextended farther back into the past than in the case of the majority\r\nof Conifers. By some authors the surviving representatives of the\r\nAraucarian stock are considered to have a strong claim to be regarded\r\nas the most primitive as well as the oldest of cone-bearing trees,\r\nthough this opinion, like many others, is not held by botanists as\r\na whole. This is not the place to discuss matters of controversy,\r\nand I shall confine myself to a general consideration of Araucaria\r\nand Agathis from the point of view of their present distribution\r\nand the part they played in the vegetation of the Mesozoic and\r\nTertiary epochs. In 1741 a plant from Amboyna, one of the Moluccas,\r\nwas described under the name _Dammara alba_. For this tree, known\r\nas the Amboyna Fine, the English botanist Salisbury instituted the\r\ngeneric name Agathis, from a Greek word (αγαθις) meaning a ball of\r\nstring and probably suggested by the form of the cones, which is the\r\ndesignation usually adopted in botanical literature instead of the\r\npre-Linnean term Dammara. The best known species of the genus is the\r\nKauri Pine, probably the finest forest tree in New Zealand where it\r\nstill flourishes from the North Cape to latitude 38° S., though the\r\noccurrence of sub-fossil trunks and pieces of buried resin shows that\r\nthe Kauri forests are gradually dwindling. The stems of this species,\r\n_Agathis australis_, rise like massive grey columns to a height of 160\r\nft., terminating in a succession of spreading branches given off in\r\ntiers from the main trunk. The thick narrow lanceolate leaves, with\r\nseveral parallel veins, reach a length of 2 to 3 inches. The female\r\nshoots have the form of small and almost spherical cones consisting of\r\na central axis bearing overlapping spiral series of broadly triangular\r\nscales (Fig. 16). Each scale carries a single seed with a large\r\nwing attached to one side which facilitates disposal by wind. Other\r\nspecies of Agathis occur in the Malay Archipelago, the Philippines,\r\nin Queensland, in the New Hebrides, New Caledonia, the Fiji Islands,\r\nand elsewhere. With the exception of the Australian Kauri (_Agathis\r\nrobusta_), with leaves larger and broader than those of the New Zealand\r\nKauri, the genus is essentially an island type. With the exception of\r\nsome species of the southern hemisphere genus Podocarpus, there are no\r\nConifers with foliage like that of Agathis. It is, however, the broad\r\nand thin single-seeded scales and the spherical cones, in some species\r\nsix inches in length, which furnish the most trustworthy means of\r\nidentifying the genus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16. A. _Agathis robusta_ Muell. (much reduced). B.\r\n_Agathis Moorei_ Lind. (1/2 nat. size).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17. _Araucaria excelsa._ The upper part of a small\r\ntree in the Cambridge Botanic Garden. (Much reduced.)]\r\n\r\nThe allied genus Araucaria, with the exception of two South American\r\nspecies, the familiar Monkey Puzzle, _Araucaria imbricata_, and\r\na Brazilian tree, _Araucaria brasiliana_, is confined within the\r\ngeographical area occupied by Agathis. The name Araucaria was first\r\nused by de Jussieu in 1789 for a plant previously referred to the\r\ngenus Pinus and described as one of the most beautiful trees of Chili.\r\nThis species, _A. imbricata_, introduced into England in 1796, grows\r\non the southern slopes of the Andes and, as in the case of the Kauri\r\nforests of New Zealand, buried stems point to a wider extension of\r\nthe forests in earlier days. The sharp and thick leaves of the Monkey\r\nPuzzle distinguish it from all other Conifers; its large almost\r\nspherical seed-bearing cones, more than half a foot in length, which\r\nmay occasionally be seen on well-grown British trees, are unlike those\r\nof other genera. Each of the deep and narrow scales bears a single\r\nseed embedded in the substance of the scale and terminates distally\r\nin a narrow upturned process. Some species of Araucaria, differing\r\nconsiderably in the form of the leaves and in the shape and structure\r\nof the seed-scales from the Chilian species, are conveniently placed\r\nin a distinct sub-division of the genus Araucaria. Of this type the\r\nNorfolk Island Pine, _Araucaria excelsa_, is the best-known example\r\n(Fig. 17). It was introduced to Kew by Sir Joseph Banks in 1793, soon\r\nafter its discovery by Captain Cook, who describes the stems of the\r\nNorfolk Island trees as resembling basaltic columns, and relates how on\r\napproaching the island everyone was satisfied that the columnar objects\r\nwere trees, 'except our Philosophers, who still maintained they were\r\nbasaltes.' The leaves are short, about half an inch long, laterally\r\ncompressed and slightly spreading and sickle-shaped--sometimes shorter\r\nand broader and overlapping--arranged in crowded spirals. The scales\r\nof the broadly oval cones are single-seeded, but differ from those\r\nof _Araucaria imbricata_ in having the seed exposed on the surface\r\nand in the greater breadth and thinner borders of the scales. In both\r\nAraucaria and Agathis the nature of the seed-scales constitutes a\r\ndistinguishing feature. The leaves of _Araucaria imbricata_ differ in\r\nform from those of other Conifers. The foliage shoots of _Araucaria\r\nexcelsa_ and other species, _e.g._ the very closely allied _A. Cookii_\r\nof the New Hebrides and New Caledonia, though not unlike the branches\r\nof a Japanese Conifer (_Cryptomeria japonica_), often cultivated in\r\nEngland, afford fairly trustworthy characters for identification\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe minute structure of the wood of both Araucaria and Agathis\r\nconstitutes an important distinguishing feature and enables us to\r\nrecognise on microscopical examination even a fragment of wood of\r\neither of these genera. The small elongated cells or water-conducting\r\nelements of the wood of the Araucarieae are characterised by one or\r\ntwo, and occasionally as many as three or four, contiguous rows\r\nof pits on their radial walls, and these appear in surface view as\r\nflattened circles or polygonal areas.\r\n\r\nThese details have been mentioned in order to show that Araucaria and\r\nAgathis are sufficiently distinct in many respects from other Conifers\r\nto render their identification in a fossil state comparatively easy, at\r\nleast much easier than the recognition of the majority of the members\r\nof the Coniferae. It would be going too far to state definitely that\r\nAraucarieae, as defined by reference to existing species, existed\r\nduring the Palaeozoic period; on the other hand it would seem in a\r\nhigh degree probable that the vegetation of the Coal age and of the\r\nsucceeding Permian period included trees in which certain Araucarian\r\ncharacters were clearly foreshadowed. The name Araucarioxylon was\r\nformerly applied to petrified wood, obtained from Palaeozoic as well\r\nas from later formations, which agrees anatomically with that of\r\nAraucaria and Agathis. It has been shown in recent years that much of\r\nthe Palaeozoic wood of this type of structure belongs to the extinct\r\ngenus Cordaites, a tree which played a prominent part in the earlier\r\nfloras. Cordaites affords a good example of a generalised type: in its\r\nwood-structure it resembles very closely the existing Araucarieae;\r\nits long strap-like leaves are not unlike those of some species of\r\nAgathis; its male flowers have often been compared with those of the\r\nMaiden Hair tree, _Ginkgo biloba_, and certain anatomical features form\r\nconnecting links between this Palaeozoic genus and the Cycads.\r\n\r\nIt is noteworthy that in another Palaeozoic genus, Walchia, the\r\nleaf-bearing branches are identical in appearance with those of the\r\nNorfolk Island Pine (Fig. 17) and some other species of Araucaria.\r\nUnfortunately our knowledge of the reproductive organs of Walchia is\r\ninsufficient to warrant any definite statement as to the degree of\r\nconsanguinity between this Permian and Upper Carboniferous plant and\r\nthe Araucarieae; it is probable that in Walchia we have a type not far\r\nremoved from the line of evolution which led to Araucaria. Petrified\r\nwood, identified as that of Walchia, and exhibiting the Araucarian type\r\nof structure, has been recorded from Permian rocks of the Vosges. Other\r\ninstances might be quoted in support of the view that the Palaeozoic\r\nfloras included a few plants with which the surviving Araucarieae may\r\nfairly claim relationship. Professor Zeiller of Paris has recently\r\ndescribed some fossil shoots from Palaeozoic rocks in India under the\r\nname _Araucarites Oldhami_ on the ground of the similarity of the\r\nleaves to those of _Araucaria imbricata_. Similarly, from Triassic\r\nrocks several fossils have been described as closely allied to\r\nAraucaria, in some cases because of anatomical resemblances and in\r\nothers on the less satisfactory evidence furnished by a similarity in\r\nthe foliage shoots. Professor Jeffrey of Harvard has recently given an\r\naccount of a new type of stem (Woodworthia) from the petrified Triassic\r\nforest of Arizona possessing some Araucarian characters, though\r\ndiffering from existing species of Araucaria in certain structural\r\nfeatures, a combination of characters regarded by this Author as an\r\nindication of relationship with the family of Conifers, which includes\r\nthe Pines, Firs, Larches and other well-known northern genera.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, from the records of Jurassic rocks that we obtain\r\nthe most satisfactory information as to the great antiquity and the\r\nvery wide geographical range of the ancestors of the recent genus.\r\nThe plant-beds of the Yorkshire coast afford clear evidence of the\r\noccurrence of Araucarian trees in the woodlands of the Jurassic\r\nperiod. Petrified wood has been found at Whitby, associated with jet,\r\nshowing the minute structural characteristics of the surviving species\r\nof Araucarieae, and it is not improbable that some at least of the\r\nWhitby jet has been formed from the wood of Araucarian plants. The\r\ncarbonised remains of leafy shoots preserved in the Jurassic shales\r\nnear Scarborough and on other parts of the Yorkshire coast include\r\ntwigs hardly distinguishable from those of _Araucaria excelsa_, though\r\nthe resemblance of external form alone, especially in the case of\r\nfoliage shoots, does not amount to proof of generic identity. We have,\r\nhowever, the much more trustworthy evidence of cones and seed-bearing\r\nscales in which the characteristic features of living species are\r\nclearly shown. Seed-bearing scales almost identical with those of\r\n_Araucaria excelsa_ and other recent species have long been known from\r\nthe Jurassic rocks of Yorkshire.\r\n\r\nFrom other parts of England where samples of Jurassic floras are\r\npreserved, as at Stonesfield in Oxfordshire, in Northamptonshire and\r\nelsewhere, equally striking examples of undoubted Araucarias have been\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nFig. 18 represents part of a large cone described in 1866 by Mr\r\nCarruthers from Jurassic rocks at Bruton in Somersetshire: this\r\nspecimen, now in the British Museum, consists of one side of a\r\nspherical cone about 5 inches long and 5 inches broad; in size, as in\r\nthe form of the seed-scales, it shows a striking likeness to the cones\r\nof the Australian species _Araucaria Bidwillii_, the Bunya Bunya of\r\nQueensland. Other equally convincing examples of Jurassic Araucarian\r\ncones and seeds may be seen in the museums of York and Northampton. On\r\nthe north-east coast of Sutherland there is a narrow strip of Jurassic\r\nbeds forming a low platform between the granitic and Old Red Sandstone\r\nhills and the sea. From these rocks Hugh Miller described several\r\nfossil plants in his _Testimony of the Rocks_, and an examination of a\r\nlarge collection obtained from this district by the late Dr Marcus Gunn\r\nshows that Miller was justified in speaking of Araucaria as a member of\r\nthis northern flora.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18. _Araucarites sphaerocarpus_ Carr. From Jurassic\r\nrocks at Bruton, Somersetshire. (British Museum, 2/3 nat. size.)]\r\n\r\nThere is abundant evidence pointing to the existence in Britain during\r\nthe Jurassic period, and in the early days of the Cretaceous epoch, of\r\nAraucarian trees which differed but slightly from the modern species\r\nconfined to the southern hemisphere. In several localities in France,\r\nGermany, and other parts of the continent, Araucarian fossils have\r\nbeen recognised in Jurassic rocks. It is almost certain that some\r\nfoliage shoots and imperfectly preserved cones described by Dr Nathorst\r\nfrom Upper Jurassic rocks in Spitzbergen were borne by a species of\r\nAraucaria. Cone-scales very similar to those from Yorkshire have been\r\ndiscovered in Wealden beds in Cape Colony, and Araucarian wood of\r\nJurassic and Cretaceous age has been found in Madagascar. From Jurassic\r\nstrata in India and Victoria (Australia), as well as from Upper\r\nJurassic and Lower Cretaceous rocks in Virginia and elsewhere in the\r\neastern United States, well preserved Araucarian fossils are recorded.\r\nIn a collection of Jurassic plants, obtained a few years ago by the\r\nmembers of a Swedish Antarctic Expedition in Graham's Land, Dr Nathorst\r\nhas recognised some cone-scales of Araucaria, which demonstrate a\r\nformer extension of the family beyond the southern limits of South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to find that when we ascend higher in the\r\ngeological series and pass beyond the Wealden strata to the Middle\r\nand Upper sub-divisions of the Cretaceous period, evidence of the\r\nwide geographical distribution of the Araucarieae is still abundant.\r\nAraucarian wood has been obtained in rocks classed as Upper Cretaceous\r\nin Egypt, in East Africa, in Dakota, and elsewhere. In the sedimentary\r\nrocks of the Tertiary period undoubted examples of Araucaria are less\r\ncommon, though there can be no doubt that the genus was much more\r\nwidely spread then than it is at the present day. The well-known\r\nTertiary plant-beds of Bournemouth have afforded specimens of foliage\r\nshoots which have been described as a species of Araucaria, though in\r\nthe absence of well-preserved cones or petrified wood we must admit\r\nthat the data are inconclusive. It is, however, legitimate to regard\r\nthe striking similarity of the Bournemouth twigs to those of _Araucaria\r\nexcelsa_ and _A. Cookii_ as constituting a fairly strong case in\r\nfavour of the persistence of Araucaria in Western Europe up to the\r\nearlier stage of the Tertiary period. Araucarian wood of Tertiary age\r\nis recorded from India, while branches with broad leaves like those\r\nof _Araucaria imbricata_ have been found in Seymour Island and the\r\nMagellan Straits, and specimens of Tertiary wood are described from\r\nPatagonia. At the other end of the world. Tertiary rocks on the west\r\ncoast of Greenland have yielded fragments which may be referred with\r\nsome hesitation to the genus Araucaria.\r\n\r\nA few words must be added in regard to the recent discovery by\r\nProfessor Jeffrey and Dr Hollick of some very interesting Cretaceous\r\nspecimens in New Jersey of well-preserved cone-scales and foliage\r\nshoots of extinct plants closely related to the existing species of\r\nAgathis(51). The American fossils are particularly valuable because\r\ntheir preservation admits of microscopical examination of the tissues.\r\nIn Cretaceous rocks of Staten Island and in other localities on the\r\neastern border of the northern United States, kite-shaped seed-bearing\r\nscales almost identical in form with those of recent species of Agathis\r\nare fairly common fossils. Similar specimens have long been known\r\nfrom Tertiary rocks in western Greenland. In the case of some of the\r\nAmerican examples each scale bore three seeds instead of a single seed\r\nin living species: on account of this difference Prof. Jeffrey and Dr\r\nHollick have adopted a distinct generic name, _Protodammara_.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing sketch is necessarily far from complete, but it may serve\r\nas an illustration of the light which is thrown on the past history of\r\nrecent plants by the investigation of the relics of ancient floras.\r\nThe family Araucarieae now represented by a small number of species\r\nwhich, with the exception of the Andian and Brazilian Araucarias, are\r\nrestricted to a small region in the southern hemisphere, was one of\r\nthe most widely spread sections of the seed-bearing plants during the\r\nMesozoic era. Ancestors of Araucaria must have been common trees in the\r\nEuropean vegetation in Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous periods, and even\r\nas late as the Tertiary period there is evidence that representatives\r\nof the family still lingered in the north. One conclusion which seems\r\nalmost unavoidable is that the species of Araucaria and Agathis that\r\nsurvive, in some cases only in one or two small islands in the South\r\nPacific, have in the course of successive ages wandered from the other\r\nend of the world. Their migrations can be partially traced by the\r\nfragments embedded in Jurassic and later sediments, but we can only\r\nspeculate as to the causes which have contributed to the changes in the\r\nfortunes of the family; how much influence may have been exerted by\r\nchanges in physical conditions in the environment, and to what extent\r\nthe production of more successful types may have been the dominant\r\ncause of the decline, it is impossible to say. One thing at least is\r\ncertain, that few existing plants are better entitled to veneration as\r\nsurvivals from the past than are the living species of Araucaria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE MAIDEN HAIR TREE\r\n\r\n                             '...the trees\r\n  That whisper round a temple become soon\r\n  Dear as the temple's self.'\r\n                                                                 Keats.\r\n\r\nThe Maiden Hair tree of China and Japan, which was introduced into\r\nEurope early in the eighteenth century, has now become fairly well\r\nknown. Though hardy in England, it requires warmer summers for full\r\ndevelopment and regular flowering. To botanists this Eastern tree is of\r\npeculiar interest, partly because of the isolated position it occupies\r\nin the plant-kingdom and partly by reason of its great antiquity. There\r\nis probably no other existing tree which has so strong a claim to be\r\nstyled a 'living fossil,' to use a term applied by Darwin to survivals\r\nfrom the past. In 1712 the traveller Kaempfer proposed for this plant\r\nthe generic name Ginkgo, and Linnaeus adopted this designation, adding\r\nthe specific name _biloba_ to denote the bisection of the wedge-shaped\r\nlamina of the leaf into two divergent segments. In 1777 the English\r\nbotanist Sir J. E. Smith expressed his disapproval of what he called\r\nthe uncouth name Ginkgo by substituting for _Ginkgo biloba_ the title\r\nSalisburia adiantifolia, but as it is customary to retain names adopted\r\nor proposed by Linnaeus, the founder of the binominal system of\r\nnomenclature, the correct botanical designation of the maiden hair tree\r\nis _Ginkgo biloba_. Mere personal preference such as that of Sir J. E.\r\nSmith for Salisburia is not an adequate reason for rejecting an older\r\nname.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19. _Ginkgo biloba_ Linn. (Slightly reduced.)]\r\n\r\nIn its pyramidal habit Ginkgo agrees generally with the larch and other\r\nConifers. Like the larch and cedar it possesses two kinds of foliage\r\nshoots, the more rapidly growing long shoots with scattered leaves\r\nand the much shorter dwarf-shoots which elongate slightly each year\r\nand bear several leaves crowded round their apex. The leaves (Fig.\r\n19), which are shed each year, are similar in the cuneate form of the\r\nlamina and in the fan-like distribution of the forked veins, to the\r\nlarge leaflets of some species of maiden hair ferns: the thin lamina\r\ncarried by a slender leaf-stalk is usually about 3 inches across,\r\nthough in exceptional cases it may reach a breadth of 8 inches. The\r\nlamina is usually divided by a deep =V=-shaped sinus into two equal\r\nhalves; it may be entire with an irregularly crenulate margin, or, on\r\nseedlings and vigorous long shoots, the lamina may be cut into several\r\nwedge-shaped segments.\r\n\r\nThe male and female flowers are borne on separate trees; the male\r\nconsists of a central axis giving off slender branches, each of which\r\nends in a small terminal knot and two elliptical capsules in which\r\nthe pollen is produced. The female flowers have a stouter axis which\r\nnormally produces two seeds at the apex. The seed is encased in a\r\ngreen fleshy substance and, as in the fruit of a cherry or plum, the\r\nkernel is protected by a hard woody shell. In the form of the leaves\r\nand in the structure of the flowers Ginkgo presents features which\r\nclearly distinguish it from the Conifers, the class in which, until\r\nrecently, it was included. In 1896 the Japanese botanist Hirase made\r\nthe important discovery that the male reproductive cells of Ginkgo are\r\nlarge motile bodies provided with a spirally coiled band of minute\r\ncilia--delicate hairs which by their rapid lashing-movement propel the\r\ncell through water. In all Flowering Plants and in Conifers the male\r\nreproductive cells have no independent means of locomotion; they are\r\ncarried to the female cell by the formation of a slender tube--the\r\npollen-tube--produced by the pollen-grain. In the Ferns, Lycopods and\r\nHorsetails--in fact in all members of the Pteridophyta--as also in the\r\nMosses and Liverworts as well as in many of the still lower plants,\r\nthe male cells swim to the egg by the lashing of cilia like those on\r\nthe male cells of Ginkgo. This difference in regard to the nature of\r\nthe male cells was considered to be a fundamental distinction between\r\nthe higher seed-bearing plants and all other groups of the vegetable\r\nkingdom. It was, therefore, with no ordinary interest that Hirase's\r\ndiscovery was received, as it broke down a distinction between the two\r\ngreat divisions of the plant-world which had been generally accepted\r\nas fundamental; though it is only fair to say that the German botanist\r\nHofmeister, a man of exceptional originality and power of grasping the\r\nessential, foresaw the possibility that this arbitrary barrier would\r\neventually be removed. The Ferns and other plants in which the male\r\ncells are motile, represent earlier stages in the progress of plant\r\ndevelopment, when the presence of water was essential for the act\r\nof fertilisation, a relic of earlier days when the whole plant-body\r\nwas fitted for a life in water. As higher types were produced, the\r\nplant-machinery became less dependent on an aqueous habitat, and the\r\nloss of organs of locomotion in the male cells is an instance of the\r\nkind of change accompanying the gradual adaptation to life on land. The\r\nidea of the gradual emancipation of plants from a watery environment is\r\nexpressed in a somewhat extreme form by the author of a book entitled\r\n_The Lessons of Evolution_(52), who states that the ocean is the mother\r\nof plant-life and that plants formed the army which conquered the land.\r\nIn Ginkgo we have a type which, though similar in most respects to\r\nthe Conifers, possesses in its motile reproductive cells a persistent\r\ninheritance from the past. The recognition of this special feature\r\nafforded a sound reason, especially when other peculiarities are\r\nconsidered, for removing Ginkgo from the Conifers and instituting a new\r\nclass-name, Ginkgoales.\r\n\r\nGinkgo is a generalised type, linked by different characters both\r\nwith living members of the two classes of naked-seeded plants and\r\nwith certain existing Palaeozoic genera. It is a survivor of a race\r\nwhich has narrowly escaped extinction; the last of a long line that\r\nhas outlived its family and offers by its persistence an impressive\r\ninstance of the past in the present. Though Mrs Bishop in her\r\n_Untrodden Paths in Japan_ speaks of forests of Maiden Hair trees\r\napparently in a wild state, it is generally believed that they were\r\ncultivated specimens. Mr Henry who has an exceptionally wide knowledge\r\nof Chinese vegetation tells us that 'all scientific travellers in\r\nJapan and the leading Japanese botanists and foresters deny its being\r\nindigenous in any part of Japan; and botanical collectors have not\r\nobserved it truly wild in China.' Moreover, Mr E. H. Wilson, after\r\ntraversing the whole of the district where Ginkgo was supposed to occur\r\nin a wild state, says that he found only cultivated trees. There is no\r\nreason to doubt that China is the last stronghold of this ancient type\r\nwhich in an earlier period of the earth's history overspread the world.\r\n\r\nA brief summary of the past history of Ginkgo and of the Ginkgoales\r\nsupplies overwhelming testimony to the tenacity of life with which the\r\nMaiden Hair tree has persisted through the ages.\r\n\r\nIt was pointed out in the account of the past history of Araucaria that\r\nthe records obtained from Palaeozoic rocks, while affording evidence of\r\nthe existence of Carboniferous and Permian genera undoubtedly allied\r\nto the living species, do not enable us to speak with certainty as to\r\nthe precise degree of affinity. Similarly, Palaeozoic leaves have been\r\ndescribed as representatives of the class of which Ginkgo is the sole\r\nsurvivor, but the evidence on which this relationship is assumed is by\r\nno means conclusive.\r\n\r\nThe generic name Psygmophyllum has been applied to some impressions\r\nof Ginkgo-like leaves discovered in the Upper Devonian rocks of\r\nBear Island, a small remnant of land in the Arctic circle, which\r\nhas furnished valuable information as to the composition of one of\r\nthe oldest floras of which satisfactory remains have been found.\r\nOther examples of these lobed, wedge-shaped leaves are recorded from\r\nCarboniferous rocks in Germany, France, and elsewhere; from Permian\r\nstrata in the east of Russia and from Palaeozoic beds in Cape Colony\r\nand Kashmir. A relationship between Psygmophyllum and Ginkgo is,\r\nhowever, by no means established and rests solely on a resemblance in\r\nthe form of the leaves. The close correspondence in form and venation\r\nbetween some leaves from Permian rocks in the Ural mountains and\r\nfrom Lower Permian beds in France, and those of the recent species,\r\nis considered by some authors sufficiently striking to justify the\r\nreference of these fossils to the genus Ginkgo. Similar leaves of\r\nPermian age, which may also be related to the existing species, have\r\nbeen described under the name Ginkgophyllum. Other specimens of\r\nPalaeozoic age from North America and elsewhere have been assigned to\r\nthe Ginkgoales; but in none of these cases, despite the resemblance\r\nin leaf-form, is there sufficiently convincing evidence of close\r\nrelationship to warrant a definite assertion that the plants in\r\nquestion were members of the group of which Ginkgo alone remains.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, an undoubted fact that the Maiden Hair tree is\r\nconnected by a long line of ancestors with the earliest phase of the\r\nMesozoic era. From many parts of the world large collections of fossil\r\nplants have been obtained from strata referred to the Rhaetic period,\r\nor to the upper division of the Triassic system. A comparison of floras\r\nfrom these geological horizons in different parts of the world points\r\nto a vegetation extending from Australia, Cape Colony, and South\r\nAmerica, to Tonkin, the south of Sweden and North America, which was\r\ncharacterised by a greater uniformity than is shown by widely separated\r\nfloras at the present day. One of the commonest genera in Rhaetic\r\nfloras is that known as Baiera; this name is applied to wedge-shaped\r\nleaves with a slender stalk similar in shape and venation to those of\r\nGinkgo, but differing in the greater number and smaller breadth of\r\nthe segments. Between the deeply dissected leaf of a typical Baiera\r\nwith its narrow linear lobes and the entire or broadly lobed leaf of a\r\nGinkgo there are many connecting links, and to some specimens either\r\nname might be applied with equal fitness. Examples of Baiera leaves,\r\nin some cases associated with fragments of reproductive organs, are\r\nrecorded from Rhaetic rocks of France, the south of Sweden, Tonkin,\r\nChili, the Argentine, North America, South Africa, and from other\r\nregions. There is abundant evidence pointing to the almost world-wide\r\ndistribution of the Ginkgoales, as represented more especially by\r\nBaiera, in the older Mesozoic floras. In the later Jurassic rocks of\r\nYorkshire true Ginkgo leaves as well as those of the Baiera type are\r\nfairly common; with the leaves have been found pieces of male and\r\nfemale flowers. Ginkgo and Baiera have been described from Jurassic\r\nrocks of Germany, France, Russia, Bornholm, and elsewhere in Europe;\r\nthey occur abundantly in Middle Jurassic rocks in northern Siberia, and\r\nare represented in the Jurassic floras of Franz Josef Land, the East\r\nCoast of Greenland, and Spitzbergen (Fig. 20). The abundance of Ginkgo\r\nand Baiera leaves associated with male flowers and seeds discovered in\r\nJurassic rocks, approximately of the same geological age as those on\r\nthe Yorkshire coast, in East Siberia and in the Amur district, has led\r\nto the suggestion that this region may have been a centre where the\r\nGinkgoales reached their maximum development in the Mesozoic period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.

Jurassic, Spitzbergen (after Heer).\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt should be added that other genera of Jurassic and Rhaetic fossils\r\nin addition to Ginkgo and Baiera have been referred to the Ginkgoales,\r\nthough evidence of such affinity is not convincing. There is, however,\r\ngood reason to believe that this widespread group was represented by\r\nseveral genera in the older Mesozoic floras.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence of the Ginkgoales in Jurassic rocks in King Charles\r\nLand and in the New Siberian Islands (lat. 78° and 75° N.), in Central\r\nChina, Japan, Turkestan, California, Oregon, South Africa, Australia,\r\nand Graham's Land demonstrates the cosmopolitan nature of the group.\r\nDuring the later part of the Jurassic period and in the Wealden floras\r\nboth Baiera and Ginkgo were abundant; leaves are recorded from Jurassic\r\nstrata in the north-east of Scotland, from Lower Cretaceous or Wealden\r\nrocks in North Germany, Portugal, Vancouver Island, Wyoming, and\r\nGreenland.\r\n\r\nDuring the Tertiary period, or probably in the earlier days of\r\nthat era. Ginkgo flourished in North America, in Alaska and in the\r\nMackenzie River district, Greenland, Saghalien Island, and in several\r\nEuropean regions. In Chapter III reference was made to the volcanic\r\nactivity which characterised the north-west European area in the\r\nearly Tertiary period and resulted in the formation of the thick\r\nsheets of basalt on the north-east coast of Ireland and in the Inner\r\nHebrides. There were occasional pauses in the volcanic activity,\r\nduring which vegetation established itself on the weathered surface\r\nof the lava, and left traces of its existence in the leaves and twigs\r\npreserved in the sedimentary material enclosed between successive\r\nlava-floras. At Ardtun Head in the Isle of Mull beautifully preserved\r\nleaves of Ginkgo, 2-4 inches in breadth, with the median sinus and\r\nthe venation characteristic of the leaves of the existing plant,\r\nhave been discovered in a bed of clay which marks the site of a\r\nlake in a depression on the lava-plateau. The resemblance of these\r\nTertiary leaves from Mull to those of the surviving Maiden Hair tree\r\nis so close as to suggest specific identity. Mr Starkie Gardner and\r\nBaron Ettingshausen have described some seeds from the London clay\r\n(Lower Tertiary) in the Isle of Sheppey as those of Ginkgo, but this\r\nidentification rests on data too insufficient to be accepted without\r\nhesitation.\r\n\r\nThe recent cultivation of _Ginkgo biloba_ in Britain may therefore\r\nbe spoken of as the re-introduction of a plant which in the earlier\r\npart or in the middle of the Tertiary period flourished in the west of\r\nScotland, and was abundant in England in the earlier Jurassic period.\r\nIt is impossible to say with any confidence where the Ginkgoales first\r\nmade their appearance, whether in the far north or in the south, nor\r\nare we able to explain the gradual decline of so venerable and vigorous\r\na race.\r\n\r\nAs we search among the fragmentary herbaria scattered through the\r\nsedimentary rocks in that comparatively small portion of the earth's\r\ncrust which is accessible to investigation, we discover evidence of a\r\nshifting of the balance of power among different classes of plants in\r\nthe course of our survey of successive floras. Plants now insignificant\r\nand few in number are found to be descendants of a long line of\r\nancestors stretching back to a remote antiquity when they formed the\r\ndominant class. Others which flourished in a former period no longer\r\nsurvive, either themselves or in direct descendants. 'The extinction of\r\nspecies has been involved in the most gratuitous mystery.' We can only\r\nspeculate vaguely as to the cause of success or failure. Certain types\r\nwere better armed for the struggle for life, and produced descendants\r\nable to hold their own and to perpetuate the race through the ages in\r\nan unbroken line. Others had a shorter life and fell out of the ranks\r\nof the advancing and ever changing army. To quote Darwin's words:'We\r\nneed not marvel at extinction; if we must marvel, let it be at our\r\nown presumption in imagining for a moment that we understand the many\r\ncomplex contingencies on which the existence of each species depends.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nMany of the books and papers dealing with subjects touched upon in\r\nthis volume are not included in the following list.
