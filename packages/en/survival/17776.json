B. GREGORY, M. AM. SOC. C. E.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the last few years a quantity of literature has appeared in which\r\nthe treatment of timber by preservatives has been discussed. The\r\nproperties of timber, both treated and untreated, have been determined\r\nby the Forest Service, United States Department of Agriculture, and\r\nthrough its researches valuable knowledge has come to engineers who have\r\nto deal with the design of wooden structures. There is very little\r\ninformation, however, regarding the effect of time on creosoted timber,\r\nand for this reason the results given herewith may prove of interest.\r\n\r\nThe material tested consisted of southern pine stringers having a\r\ncross-section approximately 6 by 16 in. and a length of 30 ft. For the\r\npurpose of testing, each beam was cut into two parts, each about 15 ft.\r\nlong. This material had been in use in a trestle of a railroad near New\r\nOrleans for 26 years. The stringers were chosen at random to determine\r\nthe general condition of the trestle. The timber had been exposed to the\r\nweather and subjected to heavy train service from the time it was\r\ntreated until it was tested. The annual rainfall at New Orleans is about\r\n60 in., and the humidity of the air is high. In spite of these\r\nconditions, there was no appearance of decay on any of the specimens\r\ntested. The specifications under which the timber was treated were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\r\nTIMBER.\r\n\r\nThe timber for creosoting shall be long-leafed or southern pine. Sap\r\nsurfaces on two or more sides are preferred.\r\n\r\n_Piles._--The piles shall be of long-leafed or southern pine, not less\r\nthan 14 in. at the butt. They shall be free from defects impairing their\r\nstrength, and shall be reasonably straight.\r\n\r\nThe piles shall be cleanly peeled, no inner skin being left on them. The\r\noil used shall be so-called creosote oil, from London, England, and\r\nshall be of a heavy quality.\r\n\r\nThe treatment will vary according to the dimensions of the timbers and\r\nlength of time they have been cut. Timbers of large and small dimensions\r\nshall not be treated in the same charge, neither shall timbers of\r\ndiffering stages of air seasoning, or the close-grained, be treated in\r\nthe same charge with coarse or open-grained timbers.\r\n\r\nThe timbers shall be subjected first to live steam superheated to from\r\n250 to 275° Fahr., and under a 30 to 40-lb. pressure. The live steam\r\nshall be admitted into the cylinders through perforated steam pipes, and\r\nthe temperature shall be obtained by using superheated steam in closed\r\npipes in the cylinders.\r\n\r\nThe length of time this steaming shall last will depend on the size of\r\nthe timbers and the length of time they have been cut. In piles and\r\nlarge timbers freshly cut, as long a time as 12 hours may be required.\r\nAfter the steaming is accomplished, the live steam shall be shut off and\r\nthe superheated steam shall be maintained at a temperature of 160° or\r\nmore and a vacuum of from 20 to 25 in. shall be held for 4 hours or\r\nlonger, if the discharge from the pumps indicates the necessity.\r\n\r\n_Oil Treatment._--The temperature being maintained at 160° Fahr., the\r\ncylinders shall be promptly filled with creosote oil at a temperature as\r\nhigh as practicable (about 100° Fahr.). The oil shall be maintained at a\r\npressure ranging from 100 to 120 lb., as experience and measurements\r\nmust determine the length of time the oil treatment shall continue, so\r\nthat the required amount of oil may be injected.\r\n\r\nAfter the required amount of oil is injected, the superheated steam\r\nshall be shut off, the oil let out, the cylinders promptly opened at\r\neach end, and the timber immediately removed from the cylinder.\r\n\r\nIn the erection of timbers the sap side must be turned up, and framing\r\nor cutting of timbers shall not be permitted, if avoidable. All cut\r\nsurfaces of timbers shall be saturated with hot asphaltum, thinned with\r\ncreosote oil. The heads of piles when cut shall be promptly coated with\r\nthe hot asphaltum and oil, even though the cut-off be temporary.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF TESTING.\r\n\r\nThe tests were made on a Riehlé 100,000-lb. machine in the Experimental\r\nEngineering Laboratory of Tulane University of Louisiana. The machine is\r\nprovided with a cast-iron beam for cross-bending tests. The distance\r\nbetween supports was 12 ft. The method of support was as follows: Each\r\nend of the beam was provided with a steel roller which rested on the\r\ncast-iron beam of the testing machine, while above the roller, and,\r\ndirectly under the beam tested, there was a steel plate 6 by 8 in. in\r\narea and 1 in. thick. The area was sufficiently great to distribute the\r\nload and prevent the shearing of the fibers of the wood. The head of the\r\nRiehlé machine is 10 in. wide. A plate, 3/8 in. thick, 6 in. wide and 18\r\nin. long, was placed between the head of the machine and the beam\r\ntested.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--DEFLECTON CURVES BEAM I]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--DEFLECTON CURVES BEAM II]\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 1.--SUMMARY OF RESULTS OF TRANSVERSE TESTS OF BEAMS AT TULANE\r\nUNIVERSITY, FEBRUARY 10TH TO MARCH 2D, 1909.\r\n\r\nColumns in table:\r\n\r\n1.

From a small piece of wood, tacked to the bottom of the beam\r\nat its center and projecting at the sides, the distance to these threads\r\nwas measured. These measurements were taken to the nearest hundredth of\r\nan inch. The mean of the deflections was taken as the true deflection\r\nfor any load.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--DEFLECTON CURVES BEAM III]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--DEFLECTON CURVES BEAM IV]\r\n\r\nIn computing the various quantities shown in Table 1, the summary of\r\nresults, the load has been assumed as concentrated at the center of the\r\nbeam. While it is true that the load was spread over a length of about\r\n12 in., due to the width of the head of the machine and the plate\r\nbetween it and the beam tested, it is also true that there were\r\nirregularities, such as bolt-holes and, in some cases, abrasions due to\r\nwear, that could not well be taken into account. Hence, it was deemed\r\nsufficiently accurate to consider the load as concentrated. Besides the\r\nhorizontal bolt-holes, shown in the photographs, there were vertical\r\nbolt-holes, at intervals in all the beams. The latter were 7/8 in. in\r\ndiameter, and in every case they were sufficiently removed from the\r\ncenter of the length of the beam to allow the maximum moment at the\r\nreduced section to be relatively less than that at the center of the\r\nbeam. For this reason, no correction was made for these holes. The\r\nbroken beams often showed that rupture started at, or was influenced by,\r\nsome of the holes, especially the horizontal ones.\r\n\r\nWhile some of the heavy oils of a tarry consistency remained, they were\r\nonly to be found in the sappy portions of the long-leaf pine and in the\r\nloblolly (Specimens II and IV). Exposure in a semi-tropical climate for\r\n26 years had resulted in the removal of the more volatile portions of\r\nthe creosote oil. The penetration of the oil into the sap wood seemed to\r\nbe perfect, while in the loblolly it varied from a fraction of an inch\r\nto 1-1/2 in. In the heart wood there was very little penetration across\r\nthe grain. The timber had been framed and the holes bored before\r\ntreatment. The penetration of the creosote along the grain from the\r\nholes was often from 4 to 6 in.\r\n\r\nCircular 39 of the Forest Service, U. S. Department of Agriculture,\r\nentitled \"Experiments on the Strength of Treated Timber,\" gives the\r\nresults of a great many tests of creosoted ties, principally loblolly\r\npine, from which the following conclusions are quoted:\r\n\r\n     \"(1) A high degree of steaming is injurious to wood. The degree of\r\n     steaming at which pronounced harm results will depend upon the\r\n     quality of the wood and its degree of seasoning, and upon the\r\n     pressure (temperature) of steam and the duration of its\r\n     application. For loblolly pine the limit of safety is certainly 30\r\n     pounds for 4 hours, or 20 pounds for 6 hours.\" [Tables 3, 6, and\r\n     7.]\r\n\r\n     \"(2) The presence of zinc chlorid will not weaken wood under static\r\n     loading, although the indications are that the wood becomes brittle\r\n     under impact.\" [Tables 3 and 4.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--DEFLECTON CURVES BEAM V]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--DEFLECTON CURVES BEAM VI]\r\n\r\n     \"(3) The presence of creosote will not weaken wood of itself. Since\r\n     apparently it is present only in the openings of the cells, and\r\n     does not get into the cell walls, its action can only be to retard\r\n     the seasoning of the wood.\" [Tables 3, 4, 5, and 6.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--DEFLECTON CURVES BEAM VII]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISONS.\r\n\r\nA comparison of the results obtained with tests made on untreated timber\r\nis interesting, and to this end Tables 2 and 3, from Circular 115,\r\nForest Service, U. S. Department of Agriculture, by W. Kendrick Hatt,\r\nAssoc. M. Am. Soc. C. E., are quoted. The tests made by the writer were\r\nfrom timber raised in Louisiana and Mississippi, while the tests quoted\r\nwere from timber raised farther north. The number of tests was not\r\nsufficient to settle questions of average strength or other qualities.\r\nIt will be seen, however, that the treated timber 26 years old compares\r\nfavorably with the new untreated timber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I, FIG. 1.----SPECIMEN IN TESTING MACHINE, SHOWING\r\nMETHOD OF SUPPORT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I, FIG. 2.--END VIEWS OF TESTED
