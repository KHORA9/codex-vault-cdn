We had just\r\ndescended the rock wall of the mountain and had reached the head of\r\nthe gorge, when my companion, Mr. Charles E. Lowe, the well-known\r\nAppalachian guide of Randolph, suddenly said to me, \"Would you like a\r\npiece of ice? I can get you some presently.\" I answered, \"Certainly,\"\r\nwondering where he would find any. When we got among the big boulders,\r\nwhich form so rough a path for the traveler at the bottom of the\r\nravine, Mr. Lowe climbed down under one of the biggest, and presently\r\nreappeared with a good sized lump of ice. I was much impressed at\r\nfinding ice at the end of the summer in this gorge, when for months\r\npast no ice or snow had been visible on the surrounding mountains. I\r\nnoticed also the peculiar, flaky formation of the ice, and saw at once\r\nthat it was something new to me, and in fact it was a piece of what I\r\nhave since learned to know as \"prismatic ice.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGLACIÈRE NEAR BRISONS.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of the year 1880, I traveled through the Alps, with a\r\nfriend from Philadelphia. On the 17th of September, we drove from\r\nGeneva to Bonneville. Thence we started on foot without a guide, and as\r\na result got lost in the woods, from which we only extricated ourselves\r\nat nightfall. After retracing our steps to Bonneville, we were glad to\r\nfind a man to show us the way we should have taken, and finally reached\r\nthe little village of Brisons in France, where we slept. The next day\r\nwe took a guide and made our way across the mountains to Annecy, at\r\none spot going out of our direct route to see a place spoken of by the\r\nnatives as a glacière. It was a little pit, and at the base of one\r\nside thereof was the mouth of a small cave into which we could not see\r\nany distance. At the bottom of the pit lay a mass of dirty snow and\r\nice to which we did not descend, as the sides of the pit were sheer\r\nand smooth, and there was no ladder. This pit seemed to be more of\r\nthe nature of a gully filled with winter snow, than a true rock cave\r\ncontaining ice.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GLACIÈRE DE L'HAUT-D'AVIERNOZ.\r\n\r\nThree days after this, on Tuesday, the 21st of September, 1880, we\r\nvisited the two largest glacières on the Mont Parmelan, near Annecy,\r\nFrance. At Annecy we inquired at the hotel for a man who knew the Mont\r\nParmelan; and, after finding one, we made our way to Les Villaz, where\r\nwe spent the night in an _auberge_. Our companion was an odd personage.\r\nHe was small, about fifty years of age, and looked meek, crushed and\r\nhungry. He wore a long black frock coat and black trousers, thin boots\r\nand a linen shirt, certainly not the ideal outfit for a cave explorer.\r\nUnder his care we started early in the morning and toiled up a mountain\r\npath some eight hundred or a thousand meters,[1] through woods and\r\npastures, to the higher plateau of Mont Parmelan, in which was situated\r\nthe first glacière. This was in a great pit, at the bottom of which,\r\non one side, was a big cave. On the side of the pit opposite to the\r\nopening, there was a steep rock slope, forty or fifty meters long,\r\nwhose lower portion was covered with snow. Down this slope we descended\r\nwith but little difficulty, reaching at the bottom an almost level ice\r\nfloor which spread over the entire cave and was formed throughout of\r\nthick, solid ice. A second and much smaller pit in the roof of the cave\r\nopened directly over the ice floor; and under this pit rose a small\r\ncone of ice, some two meters high, the only one in this glacière.\r\n\r\n[1] The metric system is used throughout this book, except in a few\r\nquotations. Thermometric observations are given in degrees Centigrade.\r\n\r\nThe glacière itself was approximately round in shape, and some twenty\r\nmeters in diameter. At one place the rock wall was broken and we could\r\nlook into a much smaller inner cave or chamber. Into this we could not\r\npenetrate on account of a long, narrow crack or hole which yawned in\r\nthe ice floor for a distance of some five or six meters and continued\r\nthrough the opening into the second chamber. We tried to cut our way\r\nalong the side of the hole, but had to give it up, finding the ice\r\ntoo hard and our time too short. The crack or hole, whose sides were\r\nsolid ice, proved conclusively that the ice in this glacière was many\r\nmeters in thickness, for we could look a long way down into the hole,\r\ncertainly for ten or twelve meters, until the ice sides disappeared in\r\ndarkness, without any visible bottom. The hole cannot be spoken of as\r\na crevasse, for, besides not looking like a crevasse, it was certainly\r\nformed by other causes than those which form the crevasses in glaciers,\r\nsince there is, as a rule, no perceptible movement in subterranean\r\nice. Doubtless, the hole was due to the drainage of the cave, which\r\nundoubtedly passed off through the hole. There may be, nevertheless,\r\nsome little motion in the ice of this glacière, for it is evident that\r\nit is fed principally directly by the winter snows; which, whether as\r\nfrozen or melted snow, descend gradually, by the force of gravitation,\r\nfrom the slope of the pit into the glacière.\r\n\r\nAs for any possibility of this great mass of ice melting away and\r\nforming again in any one year, it passes belief; there must be at least\r\nthe cubic contents of a dozen ordinary houses in the cave, and such a\r\nmass could hardly be destroyed or formed again in any such short space\r\nof time as a fall or spring. This is, therefore, probably a permanent\r\nor perennial glacière.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GLACIÈRE DE CHAPUIS.\r\n\r\nStarting out from the Glacière de l'Haut-d'Aviernoz we walked across\r\nthe plateau of the Mont Parmelan, _en route_ for the second glacière.\r\nThis plateau is a curious rock formation, consisting of what the\r\nnatives call _lapiaz_, which might be translated \"stone-heaps.\" The\r\nplateau is full of great projecting rocks; and myriads of cracks\r\nand crevices everywhere rend the surface, and over these crevices\r\none sometimes has to jump. Still, I do not remember any particular\r\ndifficulty. It was certainly not nearly as bad walking as the taluses\r\nof loose rocks one meets at the base of many mountains.\r\n\r\nOur guide led us for about an hour across the plateau in a southerly\r\ndirection, and then, looking over the side of the Parmelan, with a\r\nsweep of the arm covering south, west and north, he told us that the\r\nglacière lay between those points, but he did not know exactly where.\r\nThis seemed a rather hopeless prospect, so, as we had no clue to the\r\nwhereabouts of our prospective hole, we descended to a couple of\r\nchâlets we saw some two hundred meters below, but which at least were\r\nin the direction of Annecy. We followed a goat-herd's path which led\r\nto the châlets from the plateau, one of those dangerous grass tracks,\r\nwhere nothing would be easier than to make a slip, and where a bad\r\nslip might have unpleasant results. This is, however, just the kind\r\nof place where every one is particularly careful not to slip. We were\r\ncareful and so reached the châlets all right, and there we found a\r\nstrong, intelligent boy, who at once pointed out the place where the\r\nglacière was, about half way up the slope we had just come down. So we\r\ntook him with us, leaving our guide at the châlets to await our return.\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the glacière was in a wall of rock, set at an angle of\r\nsome thirty-five degrees; at the bottom of this there was some grass.\r\nAn easy chimney some fifteen meters high led up to the glacière. Up\r\nthis chimney we climbed. At the top we entered a little cave about\r\ntwo meters deep, by a sort of portal about two meters wide. The cave\r\nmade an elbow to the right, and passing this we found that it turned\r\nto the left and pointed directly into the mountain. The rock went\r\ndown vertically in front of us, but the boy said we could get down,\r\nso having first lowered a candle by a string to see the depth, which\r\nturned out to be a perpendicular drop of some four or five meters,\r\nwith the help of the rope we all climbed down. We were already almost\r\nentirely away from the daylight and a few steps took us into complete\r\ndarkness, except for the light we had from the candle each of us held\r\nin his hand.\r\n\r\nThe fissure led straight into the mountain. It was a couple of meters\r\nwide at places, and there we moved along the bottom. In one place it\r\nnarrowed below to a wedge, and there we progressed either by climbing\r\nalong one side or by placing one foot on one side and the other\r\nfoot on the other. The fissure led downwards as well as inwards. It\r\nwould have been nothing in daylight to go through it; but in the\r\nsemi-darkness it was not easy.\r\n\r\nAfter a descent of some twenty-five meters or thereabouts, we arrived\r\nat the glacière, and I have certainly never seen a weirder place. There\r\nwas a great arched rock dome, perhaps six meters in height, and some\r\ntwelve in diameter; the floor was a sheet of smooth, slippery ice, at\r\none end curling over, gently at first, afterwards more steeply, to a\r\nlower depth; and on the sides were seven or eight ice columns streaming\r\nfrom cracks in the rocks to the floor. Each of these columns was some\r\nthree or four meters high, and, small at the top and in the middle,\r\nspread out at the base into the shape of fans. In the dim candle light\r\nand the cold damp atmosphere, the columns loomed up like so many\r\nghosts, and the landscape impression was strange and solemn. The air\r\nhere seemed perfectly still.\r\n\r\nThere was another curiosity. The fissure we had come down, at this\r\npoint some three meters wide, was filled, just beyond the glacière,\r\nwith pure, transparent water, which formed a little lake: this was\r\nperhaps one meter deep, and extended across the fissure, barring\r\nfurther progress. It certainly seems strange that in the same cavern,\r\nunder nearly the same conditions of temperature, there should be one\r\nplace covered with a flooring of ice and another filled with water. The\r\nexplanation, however, is perhaps not far to seek. Over the lake there\r\nwas a distinct draught of air. The draught probably melts the ice in\r\nsummer, if indeed it does not prevent any from forming in winter. There\r\nare, so far, no winter observations reported of this cave, yet it would\r\nseem to be one which would well repay the trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GLACIÈRE DE CHAUX-LES-PASSAVANT.\r\n\r\nOn the 17th of August, 1894, my brother and I arrived at Besançon,\r\nthe Vesontio of the Romans, bent on seeing the Glacière de\r\nChaux-les-Passavant or de la Grâce-Dieu, which is not far distant\r\nfrom the town. The hotel we stopped at was pretty bad; the beds were\r\nsurmounted with those old-fashioned curtains which were of use before\r\nthe invention of glass windows, but which now only serve to exclude air\r\nand ventilation. However, I learnt something of the manners and customs\r\nof the country, for on getting down at six o'clock the next morning\r\nfor breakfast, the first question the waiter asked was: _Quel vin\r\nmonsieur prendra-t-il?_ At seven o'clock we sallied forth in a little\r\nopen one-horse victoria, with a dull gray sky overhead. Besançon is\r\nwell down in a valley, so the first five miles of the road were a slow,\r\ngradual rise to the surrounding levels. The scenery as we drove along\r\nreminded us of Turner's pictures: distant vistas of hills and valleys\r\nwith factories blowing off their smoke and with tumble-down old houses\r\nensconced in picturesque nooks, just those long-distance effects that\r\nTurner loved to paint and which, for some reason, the artists of the\r\npresent generation have generally neglected and usually speak of as\r\nunpaintable or unpicturesque. There was a row of trees, the whole way,\r\non each side of the road, a bit of practical forestry, the wisdom of\r\nwhich it would be well for Americans to recognize. After our poor horse\r\nhad pulled us up the long hills, we had an almost level road running in\r\na straight line as far as the eye could see. We saw at least a hundred\r\nlittle hawks, who live on field mice and other rodents, and whose\r\npreservation is another evidence of French wisdom. The last four miles\r\nof the drive was up a ravine in the woods, near the beginning of which\r\nwe passed the Trappist convent of la Grâce-Dieu.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLACIÈRE DE CHAUX-LES-PASSAVANT.\r\n\r\n  From a Photograph by E. Mauvillier.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOpposite the entrance of the glacière, there is a little restaurant\r\nwhere the peasants come to dance and picnic, and where the few\r\ntravellers who get to these parts, can obtain a tolerable _déjeuner_.\r\nThey keep a fair _vin du pays_ there, and we had some trouble on the\r\nway home in consequence. Our driver, a talkative specimen of the genus\r\nand an old soldier of Bourbaki's, told us, on the way out, many things\r\nabout Besançon during the Franco-German war and of the retreat of the\r\nFrench army into Switzerland; but on the way home, he showed that he\r\nevidently was not a member of the blue ribbon army. He first seemed\r\ndesirous of not taking us back to Besançon, preferring to go in the\r\nother direction towards Bale; and afterwards he evinced a violent\r\ninclination to go to sleep. We thought we should have to request him\r\nto change seats with us, and drive back ourselves, but we obviated the\r\ndifficulty by plying him with questions as soon as he began to nod on\r\nhis box. Eventually, we reached Besançon all right, only once bumping a\r\npassing cart, and only once nearly capsizing into a ditch. If Americans\r\ncan learn some points from Europeans about forestry, I think the latter\r\nmight get some equally valuable information from us concerning the use\r\nof water, externally and internally.\r\n\r\nThe good lady at the restaurant acts the part of the old-fashioned\r\ncave dragon, and we had to appease her by handing over four _sous_ as\r\na preliminary to exploration. She also had a sign up, saying that no\r\none is allowed to break off or take away any ice, which must sadly\r\ninterfere with the tourists' privilege of bringing away specimens.\r\n\r\nThe entrance of the glacière was surrounded by woods, which formed\r\na natural rampart to anything like wind. As we stood facing the\r\nglacière a great pit opened before us, with a slope about one hundred\r\nand thirty-five meters long leading to the bottom. This slope is at\r\nfirst gentle in its gradient, but lower down it steepens to an angle\r\nof some thirty degrees so that we were glad to resort to the trail\r\nwhich descends in regular Alpine zigzags. In one place, on the right\r\nhand, there were the remains of a stone wall with a door, and local\r\ntradition relates that in former times there was a sort of fortified\r\nhabitation there, which was used in war times as a place of retreat.\r\nThe lower part of the slope is covered by a protecting roof of rock\r\nwhich, thin at the rim where it is edged with forest, gradually slopes\r\ndownward overhead so that at the mouth of the glacière we looked back\r\nand up what might be described as an immense tunnel. The lower part\r\nof the slope was a mixture of broken rocks, mud and ice: the last,\r\nhowever, seemed to be all on the surface, although it was impossible to\r\ndetermine whether it went to any depth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ICE STALAGMITES, CHAUX-LES-PASSAVANT.\r\n\r\n  From a Photograph by E. Mauvillier.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAt the base of the tunnel we found ourselves on the threshold of an\r\nimmense, almost circular cave, with a diameter of some fifty meters,\r\nrising overhead into a regular vault or dome about twenty-seven meters\r\nin height. The entrance to the cave is so large that plenty of daylight\r\nis admitted, and the whole cave easily examined. The rocks are of a\r\nyellowish brown hue, and I could not help thinking of Nibelheim in\r\nRichard Wagner's Rheingold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.[2] Vertical Section of Chaux-les-Passavant.]\r\n\r\n[2] The figures in this book are rough sketches, without pretense at\r\naccuracy of measurement, and are only explanatory of the text.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the cave was entirely covered with a flooring of ice. How\r\nthick this flooring was there was no means of judging, as there were\r\nno holes, but it must have been at least two or three meters thick in\r\nplaces. At the back of the cavern, directly facing the entrance, one\r\nmagnificent frozen water fall streamed from a fissure. It was perhaps\r\nfive meters high, and began to take the fan shape from its origin. The\r\nbase was about four meters wide, and did not rest on the ice floor, but\r\non a sloping rock extending out from the side of the cave.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable feature of all, were six or seven great ice\r\nstalagmites, shaped like cones or rough pyramids, which rose on the\r\nfloor of the cave. One of these was at least five meters in diameter\r\nand six in height, and seemed perfectly solid. In the case of two of\r\nthe others, however, the cones were broken on one side, revealing in\r\neach the stem and branches of a young pine tree. These evidently had\r\nbeen planted in the ice and round them the columns had grown. Whether\r\nall the ice cones were thus artificial in their origin I could not\r\ndetermine, but it seemed probable that they were the result of years of\r\nundisturbed accretion and growth. In both the cones where the break on\r\nthe side gave a view into the interior, the dark blue-green color of\r\ndeep glacier crevasses was present.\r\n\r\nA pool of water, perhaps thirty centimeters in depth and three or four\r\nmeters in diameter, lay at one place on the ice floor. The whole cave\r\nwas damp and the ice in places decidedly slushy, in fact all the signs\r\nshowed that it was thawing. In the case of this glacière as well as\r\nin those of the Mont Parmelan, it seemed clear that it must be in the\r\nwinter months that the formation of ice takes place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ICE STALAGMITES, CHAUX-LES-PASSAVANT.\r\n\r\n  From a Photograph by E. Mauvillier.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\nDÓBSINA JEGBARLANG.\r\n\r\nThe cavern of Dóbsina, in the Carpathian Mountains, is easily reached\r\neither from Poprád to the north, or from Dóbsina to the south. The\r\nhotel at Poprád is better, however, than the inn at Dóbsina, where\r\nmy brother and I spent two nights. It was decidedly primitive. The\r\nfood was not so bad, but the pigs ran round in the courtyard, and one\r\nmorning a gypsy band woke us at half-past three o'clock by playing\r\nin front of our windows, in dreadful wailing tones, which were most\r\nirritating at that hour. At the proper time, however, Hungarian gypsy\r\nmusic,--despite the fact that none of the players ever seem to look at\r\nthe leader, and that each man appears to play the tune he likes the\r\nbest,--is strangely fascinating.\r\n\r\nDóbsina itself lies in a hollow, surrounded with well-wooded hills, the\r\ngeneral appearance much resembling some of the valleys of the White\r\nMountains of New Hampshire. My brother and I started from Dóbsina on\r\nthe morning of the 27th of July, 1895, at half-past seven o'clock, in\r\na little open carriage with excellent horses and a Hungarian driver in\r\nnational costume. He was a nice fellow, but he did not understand a\r\nword of German. The road reminded us of some of our own mountain roads,\r\nas it was rough, full of holes and partly washed away by the rains. We\r\nfirst ascended to the crest of the surrounding hills and then descended\r\nto the Stracena Thal, a wild limestone valley covered with fine\r\nforest. Two hours and a half driving landed us at the hotel-restaurant\r\nnear the cave, at which I should certainly stop on another visit. It\r\nwas half an hour's stroll thence, through beautiful woods, to the\r\ncavern's entrance. Northwards in the distance the Tátra Range was\r\nvisible, a set of sharp bare rock peaks, at whose base, ensconced in\r\npine forests, is situated the famous Hungarian summer resort of Tátra\r\nFüred, which much resembles Bar Harbor.\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the cavern is enclosed by a fence with a gate, and here\r\nthe Dóbsina people have a high tariff and take toll from tourists. At\r\nthe gate, we waited for half an hour, until a sufficient number of\r\npersons had arrived to form a party. This mode of visiting the cave\r\nrather detracts from the pleasure, even though it does away with all\r\ndifficulty and makes the beauties of Dóbsina accessible to everyone. It\r\nwas also necessary to wait long enough to cool off thoroughly before\r\nentering, on account of the icy air of the cavern, where heavy winter\r\nclothes are indispensable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. Vertical Section of Dóbsina.]\r\n\r\nThe entrance to Dóbsina faces nearly due north. It is small, perhaps\r\ntwo meters wide and three meters high, and is perfectly sheltered\r\nfrom any wind. The sudden drop in temperature at the entrance was\r\nstartling; in fact it was the most extreme change I have noticed in any\r\ncave. Within the length of an ordinary room, say in a distance of five\r\nmeters, we passed from an extremely hot summer morning to the chill of\r\na mid-winter afternoon. A slight air current, perhaps, issued from the\r\nentrance, as we observed a faint mist there. At the rock portal there\r\nwas ice on the rocks overhead, and underfoot was the beginning of the\r\nhuge mass of ice which almost fills the cavern. A descent down eighteen\r\nwooden steps landed us at the beginning of a great ice floor, in what\r\nis called the _Grosser Saal_. It is a magnificent cave. The floor is\r\na sheet or rather a mass of solid ice, the surface of which is level\r\nenough in one place to permit of skating; in other spots it is sloping\r\nand covered with small ice hillocks. The ice is solid throughout,\r\nwithout any holes or cracks. Several fissure columns stream to the\r\nfloor from cracks in the sides. Joining the roof to the floor are\r\nnumerous big ice stalactites, which form frozen pillars and columns.\r\nThese are from eight to eleven meters in height, and some two to three\r\nmeters in average breadth and width. Nearly translucent, they are\r\ncovered with all sorts of icy ornaments hanging about them in tufts and\r\nfringes; they are beautiful in their shapes, as well as in their white\r\nand blue colors. One of these columns is called the _Brunnen_, because\r\nuntil about ten years ago, a small stream dribbled continuously from\r\nthe roof and cut a channel across the ice floor; but now the stream has\r\nsolidified into the pillar, and the channel is filled up, although it\r\ncan still be traced in the ice.\r\n\r\nThe cavern is lighted by electricity, which has the merit, even if it\r\nbrings in an element of artificiality, of clearly revealing one of the\r\nchief glories of Dóbsina. This is the rime or hoar frost, which in the\r\nshape of ice or snow crystals, covers the entire limestone roof, and,\r\nreflecting the electric light, shines like frosted silver. Some of\r\nthese frost crystals seem to be precipitated to the floor, and in one\r\nplace I found a small sheet of them, perhaps two meters in width each\r\nway, which looked and felt like genuine snow. The general color effect\r\nof all this upper cave is white, although there is some blue in the\r\nice, and gray and brown in the rocks and shadows. It would not be much\r\nof a misnomer to call Dóbsina \"the great white cave.\"\r\n\r\nThe ice extended to the sides of the cave except in two places. Here\r\nthere were holes in the ice, bridged by low rock arches. We passed\r\nthrough one of these and descended by a wooden staircase some eighty\r\nsteps, afterwards returning up through the other arch by another\r\nstaircase. At the bottom we stood in a magnificent gallery named the\r\n_Korridor_, formed by a solid wall of ice on one side and by a wall\r\nof limestone rock on the other. The ice wall is the lower portion of\r\nthe ice floor; the rock wall is the continuation of the roof. For the\r\nentire distance the ice wall rises almost perpendicularly some fifteen\r\nmeters in height, while the rock wall arches overhead.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LOWER ROSITTEN ALP AND THE UNTERSBERG.]\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the _Korridor_ was filled with blocks of fallen\r\nlimestone, through which any water drains off, and on which there was a\r\nwooden walk, so that we circled round the ice with the greatest ease.\r\nAt one place on the limestone wall hung a cluster of big icicles,\r\nwhich, from their shape really deserved the name they bear, of the\r\n_Orgel_. At another place a hole, some six or seven meters deep, was\r\nhewn, in the form of a small chamber, directly into the ice mass. This\r\nis the _Kapelle_, where we performed our devotions by leaving our\r\nvisiting cards on the floor. Near the middle of the _Korridor_ the ice\r\nmass bulges out and extends to the limestone wall, breaking the whole\r\n_Korridor_ into two parts, the western portion about eighty meters, and\r\nthe eastern about one hundred and twenty meters long. This necessitated\r\ncutting a tunnel about eight meters long in the ice to get through. The\r\ncolor of the _Korridor_ is a darkish gray and is much more sombre than\r\nthat of the _Grosser Saal_. A remarkable feature of the ice wall is the\r\nfact that distinct bands of stratification are visible in the ice in\r\nmany places. Why the _Korridor_ is not filled up with ice and why the\r\nice is perpendicular for such a distance are questions I am unable to\r\nanswer satisfactorily; but it is probable that the temperature of the\r\nrock walls is sufficiently high to prevent ice from forming in winter\r\nor to melt it in summer if it does form in winter.\r\n\r\nThe air in Dóbsina seemed still, and scarcely felt damp. In one or two\r\nplaces in the _Grosser Saal_ there was a slight sloppiness, showing\r\nincipient signs of thaw. In the _Korridor_ it was freezing hard.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KOLOWRATSHÖHLE.\r\n\r\nThe Kolowratshöhle is situated on the north slope of the Untersberg,\r\nnear Salzburg, at an altitude of 1391 meters. My brother and I visited\r\nit on the 2d of August, 1895. We had one of the patented guides of the\r\ndistrict, Jacob Gruber by name, in regular Tyrolese dress, with gray\r\n_jacke_ and black chamois knee breeches. We left Salzburg in the early\r\nmorning in an _einspänner_ and drove to the foot of the Untersberg in\r\nabout an hour, whence, by a rough path passing by the Rositten Alp, we\r\nascended to the cave in about three hours. The last hundred and sixteen\r\nmeters of the path were cut across some moderately steep rock slabs and\r\na perfectly unnecessary iron hand-railing affixed.\r\n\r\nThe entrance faces northeast. Here there must have been a slight\r\ndraught of cold air moving outwards, the effect of which was\r\nperceptible to the eye, as at the point where the cold inside air\r\nmet the quiet warm outside air, a faint mist was visible. From the\r\nentrance, a sharp slope, set at an angle of about forty degrees, led\r\nto the lowest point of the cave. The upper half of this slope was\r\nstill covered with the winter snow which had blown or had slid in. We\r\ndescended on the right hand edge of the snow by means of some steps\r\ncut in the rock by the _Deutschen-Oesterreichischen Alpen Club_.\r\nThese steps were covered with a sticky, red mud, which left almost\r\nineradicable stains on our clothing, and as there was also ice in\r\nplaces, they were decidedly slippery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ENTRANCE OF THE KOLOWRATSHÖHLE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Vertical Section of the Kolowratshöhle.]\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of the slope we were at the lowest point of the cave,\r\nto which all the water flowed, and where it drained off into a crack\r\nwith a loud gurgling noise. Back of us was the daylight streaming\r\nthrough the entrance; opposite to us was first an ice floor, then a\r\ngreat ice slope, which came down from the further end of the cave. The\r\nice was transparent and of a pale ochre-greenish hue, and filled the\r\nentire width of the cave. There is a streak of iron, probably, through\r\nthe limestone, which in places tints the rocks a dull red. The color\r\nimpression is a dull green-red, and, on account of the size of the\r\nentrance, the light effect is only semi-subterranean.\r\n\r\nThe ice floor was covered with a layer of slabs of ice, eight or ten\r\ncentimeters thick, which, earlier in the year, had evidently had water\r\nunder them. The ice wall or ice slope consisted of two big waves, one\r\nabove the other, the lower set at an angle of about ten degrees, the\r\nupper set at an angle of about twenty-five degrees. To get up the upper\r\nwave required about twelve steps cut with the axe. Behind the upper\r\nwave, five or six fissure columns streamed out to the beginning of the\r\nice. One ice stalactite, at least two or three meters long, overhung\r\nthe ice floor, and Gruber said about this: \"Well, I wonder it has not\r\nfallen yet: they seldom last as late in the year,\" a confirmation of\r\nwhat was clearly evident, namely, that the whole cave was in a state of\r\nthaw.\r\n\r\nIn two places there was a strong, continuous drip from the roof to the\r\nice floor, which formed, in each case, what I can only call an ice\r\nbasin. These basins were nearly circular; one was about four meters,\r\nthe other about two, in diameter. Around about two-thirds of the rim\r\nof the larger one, ice rose in a surrounding ring two or three meters\r\nhigh, suggesting that earlier in the year this basin was a cone, and\r\npossibly a hollow cone. The depth in the ice floor, in both cases,\r\nwas about one and a half meters, and each basin contained some thirty\r\ncentimeters in depth of water. They reminded me of the rock basins one\r\nsees in mountain torrents, where an eddying current has worn smooth all\r\nthe edges of the rocks. From the larger of these basins, a channel as\r\ndeep as the basin ran to the lowest point of the cave. This channel was\r\ncut out by the overflow, which ran through it in a tiny stream.[3]\r\n\r\n[3] The photographs of the Rositten Alp, of the entrance of the\r\nKolowratshöhle, and of the interior of the Kolowratshöhle, were made\r\nfor me on the 16th of July, 1896, by Herr Carl Hintner, Jr., of\r\nSalzburg. The two latter photographs are, I believe, the first good\r\nones ever obtained of the inside of the cave. They were taken without\r\nartificial light on quick plates; the best of the two received an hour\r\nand a half, the other two hours' exposure. The photographer said at\r\nfirst that it was not possible to succeed, and it was only by promising\r\nto pay him in any case, that he could be induced to try.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOP OF ICE SLOPE, KOLOWRATSHÖHLE.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCHAFLOCH.\r\n\r\nThe Schafloch, on the Rothhorn, near the Lake of Thoune, is one of the\r\nbiggest glacières in the Alps. On the 15th of August, 1895, after early\r\ncoffee, made by the _portier_ of the Hotel Belvedère at Interlaken,\r\nI drove to Merligen, on the north shore of the lake, with Emil Von\r\nAllmen, an excellent guide. We left Merligen on foot at a quarter\r\nbefore seven, and, making no stops on the way, reached the Schafloch at\r\nten minutes past ten. The path mounts gently up the Wüste Thal, which\r\nhigher up is called the Justiz Thal. The track through the latter is\r\nalmost on a level, over grassy alps. On the right hand rise the steep,\r\nalmost dolomitic, limestone cliffs of the Beatenberg. On the left is\r\nthe range of the Rothhorn, with steep grass and forest slopes below,\r\nand limestone cliffs above. The last hour of the walk was up these\r\nslopes, by what Baedeker calls a \"giddy path.\" By leaving the word\r\n\"giddy\" out, his description is accurate. The cavern is at the base of\r\nthe limestone cliff, and the grass slope extends up to it.\r\n\r\nThe entrance to the Schafloch is at an altitude of 1752 meters: it\r\nis a fine archway, and a low wall is built partly across it. In\r\nfront of this, we sat down and consumed our chicken and cheese, and\r\nthat best of a traveller's drinks, cold tea. The day was windless,\r\nand when I lighted a cigar, to see whether there was any draught at\r\nthe entrance, the smoke rose straight up, showing that the air was\r\nperfectly still. When we were sufficiently cooled off, we entered the\r\ncave. The entrance faces east-south-east, but after about ten meters\r\nthe cavern takes a sharp turn to the left, forming a sort of elbow,\r\nand runs about due south, constantly descending in an almost straight\r\nline. For the first eighty meters or so, the floor was covered with\r\nblocks of fallen limestone, among which we had to carefully pick our\r\nway. Then we began to find ice, which, a few meters further on, spread\r\nout across the entire width of the cave, with a gentle slope towards\r\nthe left. The surface of the ice was rather soft, and the whole cave\r\nwas evidently in a state of thaw. A few scratches with the axe--the\r\nmost invaluable friend in an ice cave--were necessary at one place to\r\nimprove our footing. It would have been impossible to move here without\r\na light, and I carried our torch, made of rope dipped in pitch, which\r\noccasionally dropped black reminders on my clothes. We were in the\r\nmiddle of a great ice sheet to which several fissure columns streamed.\r\nOn the right hand a beautiful ice stalactite flowed from the roof to\r\nthe floor; it was some five meters high, and perhaps seventy-five\r\ncentimeters in diameter, and swelled out slightly at the base. On the\r\nleft hand were three or four ice stalagmites, shaped like pyramids or\r\ncones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AT THE ENTRANCE OF THE SCHAFLOCH.]\r\n\r\nOne of these cones was especially remarkable. It was at least five\r\nmeters high--Von Allmen said eight--and at the bottom was about four\r\nmeters in diameter. The base of this cone was entirely hollow. There\r\nwas a break on one side by which we could enter, and we then stood\r\non a rock floor with a small ice dome or vault overhead. I have seen\r\nno other hollow cone like this. The guide lighted a red Bengal fire\r\ninside, when the whole pyramid glowed with a delicate pink light,\r\nresembling _Alpenglühn_. Near this cone stood the half of another\r\nice cone. It was quite perfect, and the missing half was cut off\r\nperpendicularly, as if with a huge cleaver. A hollow in the base of\r\nthe remnant showed that this cone must have been originally also a\r\nhollow cone, and its destruction was probably due to the change in the\r\ntemperature of the drip from the roof, at the setting in of the summer\r\nthaw.\r\n\r\nJust beyond the cones, the ice floor steepens and curls over into a\r\nbig ice slope, one of the finest I have seen. Von Allmen spoke of this\r\nas _der gletscher_, an expression I never heard applied elsewhere to\r\nsubterranean ice. On the right side, the slope would be difficult\r\nto descend in the darkness. On the left, the slope is gentle and a\r\nrock juts out a little way down. Von Allmen insisted on roping--an\r\nunnecessary safeguard--but he said: \"If you slip, you will probably\r\nbreak an arm or a leg, and then we shall be in a nice mess.\" He then\r\ncut about twelve steps in the ice, down to the rock, while I shed light\r\non the performance with our torch. We were so completely away from\r\ndaylight that black was the predominating color; and even the ice was a\r\ndark gray, and only appeared white in the high lights. Below the rock,\r\nwe found a narrow strip on the left side of the ice slope free from ice\r\nand blocked with boulders, over which we carefully picked our way down.\r\nAt the bottom, the ice expanded into a level surface, stretching nearly\r\nto the end of the cave. There were only a few fissure columns in this\r\npart of the cavern, where the most remarkable feature was the cracks\r\nin the rock walls, which were so regular in formation that they almost\r\nlooked like man's handiwork. The rocks are free from stalactites, and\r\nin fact stalactites seem a good deal of a rarity in glacières.\r\n\r\nOn retracing our steps, we saw, when the first glimmers of daylight\r\nbecame perceptible, the rocks assume a brilliant blue color, as if they\r\nwere flooded with moonlight. This effect lasted until near the mouth of\r\nthe cavern.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOLLOW CONE AND FISSURE COLUMNS, SCHAFLOCH.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDÉMÉNYFÁLVA JEGBARLANG.\r\n\r\nA little west of Poprád, in Northern Hungary, on the railroad between\r\nSillein and Kassa, is the village of Liptós Szt Miklós, to which place\r\nI journeyed on the 12th of June, 1896. The conductor was the only man\r\non the train or at any of the stations who would admit that there was a\r\nglacière at Déményfálva, and that it was feasible to get into it: every\r\none else professed entire ignorance on the subject. It is perhaps,\r\nworth noting at this time that it is always difficult to get any\r\ninformation about glacières; in fact, the advice about cooking a hare\r\nmight well be applied to glacière hunting: first catch your glacière.\r\n\r\nThe scenery between Sillein and Miklós was picturesque. The hills were\r\ncovered with forest. In one place, the railroad ran through a beautiful\r\nmountain gorge alongside a river, where a number of rafts were floating\r\ndown. There were also some primitive ferries, where a rope was\r\nstretched across the river, and the force of the current carried the\r\nferryboat across, once it was started. Many peasants were at work in\r\nthe fields; often in squads. White, blue, brown, and a dash of red were\r\nthe predominating colors in their dress. The men wore white trousers,\r\nmade of a kind of blanket stuff, and a leather, heelless moccasin of\r\nnearly natural shape. Almost all the women had bare feet; those of\r\nthe older ones were generally shaped according to Nature's own form,\r\nwhile those of the younger ones were generally distorted from wearing\r\nfashionable shoes. We went past several villages of huts with thatched\r\nroofs, something like the Russian villages one sees beyond Moscow, only\r\nless primitive.\r\n\r\nThe inn at Miklós was poor, and as at Dóbsina, the pigs lived in the\r\nyard and occasionally came for an interview under the covered doorway.\r\nInquiries elicited the information that Déményfálva could be reached\r\nby carriage, so I engaged one at the livery stable. The owner told me\r\nthat about twenty years before, he leased the glacière and carried on a\r\nregular business in supplying Buda-Pest with ice. He had thirty lamps\r\nput in to give light to the workmen, who brought up the ice in baskets\r\non their backs.\r\n\r\nAt half past five o'clock next morning the carriage, which was innocent\r\nof paint, lined with a sort of basket work and without springs, but\r\ncertainly strongly built, stood at the door. A boy of about eighteen\r\nyears of age, who could speak German, went along as interpreter. The\r\nmorning was dismal, and, every quarter of an hour or so, a shower of\r\nthick mist fell and gradually made us damp and uncomfortable. After\r\nabout twenty minutes on a pretty bad road, we came to a place where\r\nthere was a fork, and the driver turned to the left, over a track which\r\nconsisted of two deep ruts through the fields. Soon after, we heard\r\nsome shouting behind us, and a fierce-looking man, in a leather jacket\r\nand carrying a large axe, came up and abused the driver. He was not\r\nan agreeable person; however, presently he simmered down and began to\r\nsmile. It turned out that he was a _wächter_, that is, a guardian of\r\nthe fields, and that we were trespassing. The driver meekly promised\r\nto return by the other route, and we went on our way in peace. After\r\nawhile, we drove into some woods and then into a mountain gorge, with\r\nforest-covered slopes at the base and with limestone cliffs jutting\r\nout above. Here we came to the cottage of the _wächter_ or _förster_\r\nof the surrounding woods, who also acted as guide to the cave, for the\r\nfew tourists who came to see it; and when he heard of our destination,\r\nhe at once slipped on a second ragged coat, took a woodman's axe and\r\nstarted on foot, going much faster than the carriage. This was not\r\nsurprising, for the road resembled nothing but the bed of a mountain\r\nbrook, a mass of boulders with ruts between them. This highway was made\r\nby the peasants driving their carts over the plain in the same place,\r\nand as the soil was cut away, the boulders appeared; and over and among\r\nthese we went banging along, and we were jolted about and bumped into\r\neach other, until every bone in my body ached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ON THE ICE SLOPE, SCHAFLOCH.]\r\n\r\nAt a quarter past seven o'clock we came to another house in a little\r\nglade, where the carriage stopped; and on asking the _förster_ for\r\nhis name, he wrote down in my note book, in a clear well formed\r\nhand:--Misura, Franz. From the glade, ten minutes' walk on a mountain\r\npath, up an easy slope, took us to the entrance of Déményfálva. It is\r\nabout two meters wide by three quarters of a meter high. We passed\r\nthrough and entered a large chamber, well lighted from the right by\r\nanother opening, which is higher up and bigger than the entrance.\r\nThe air in this chamber was at about the same temperature as that of\r\nthe outside air, and, on our return from the nether world, it seemed\r\npositively balmy. In the floor at the end of the chamber, a small pit\r\nyawns open. It is perpendicular on three sides and set at a sharp\r\nangle on the fourth. A wooden staircase of some two hundred steps, many\r\nof which are sadly out of repair, leads nearly straight down this slope\r\nto the glacière.\r\n\r\nAfter descending about eighty steps of the staircase, bits of ice\r\nappeared on the walls and floor and after some thirty steps more, a\r\nlateral gallery opened to the right, and into this we turned. This may\r\nbe called the upper cave or story, for in Démenyfálva--besides the\r\nentrance chamber--there are practically two stories, the upper one of\r\nwhich is mainly ornamented with stalactites, the lower one with ice.\r\nThere was a little ice on the floor from which rose some small ice\r\ncolumns, perhaps fifty centimeters in height. The cave or gallery had\r\na gentle downward slope and turned towards the left. After some little\r\ndistance, we came to another wooden staircase, of ten or twelve steps,\r\nquite coated over with thick, solid ice. Misura had to cut away at it\r\nfor several minutes, before he could clear the steps enough to descend.\r\nThis was in fact the beginning of an ice wall, the _Eiswand_ or\r\n_Eismauer_, which, turning to the right, flowed through a rock arch to\r\nthe lowest cave. The rock arch or portal was some three meters wide and\r\ntwo meters high, and a fringe of beautiful organ-pipe like icicles hung\r\non it on the right hand. Just beyond the portal the ice sloped steeply\r\nfor a couple of meters; then it became level and on it rose a little\r\npyramid, a meter and a half in height perhaps, and a column; then the\r\nice sloped away again to the lower cave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE REAR OF THE SCHAFLOCH.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Vertical Section of Démenyfálva.]\r\n\r\nWe then continued our course beyond the rock portal along the upper\r\ncavern for about two hundred meters. It was a fine large gallery or\r\npassage and during the first fifty meters or so, we found numerous\r\nsmall ice cones, perhaps a hundred of them, from tiny little ones to\r\nsome about forty centimeters in height. Many of these were columnar in\r\nform, nearly as large at the top as at the base: in some cases the top\r\nwas flat, and the columns then looked almost as if an upper portion\r\nwere sawn off. I have seen this shape of column nowhere else. In places\r\nthere were slabs and bits of ice on the floor. The last hundred meters\r\nof this upper cave was free from ice and was exceptionally dry. It was\r\nformed of a pale yellow limestone rock, almost dolomitic in color, and\r\nmany stalactites, in their thousand various shapes, hung from the roof\r\nand on the sides. In one spot, one big limestone stalagmite towered up\r\ndirectly in the middle of the gallery. We did not go to the end of the\r\ncave, where ice has never been found.\r\n\r\nRetracing our course past the rock portal to the entrance pit, we\r\ndescended on the long staircase for some eighty steps more, the amount\r\nof ice on the rocks steadily increasing. In places, frost crystals had\r\nformed in small quantities on the roof and walls. At the bottom of the\r\npit, another lateral gallery, directly under the upper gallery, opened\r\nto the right. Entering this, we passed over broken limestone débris,\r\nwhich seemed to overlie a mass of ice. Limestone stalactites were\r\nnoticeable all through this lower cavern, and frost and icicles had\r\nsometimes formed over them, in which case the ice stalactite assumed\r\nthe form of the limestone stalactite. Advancing a few meters, we went\r\nby, on our right hand, an ice pyramid of a couple of meters in height.\r\nJust beyond this, the cave turned to the left like the upper cave,\r\nand we descended to a level floor of transparent ice, into which we\r\ncould see some distance. At this spot, numerous icicles, generally of\r\ninconsiderable size, hung from the roof and on the sides of the cavern.\r\n\r\nAt the further end of this ice floor or ice lake we reached an ice\r\nslope, the _Eiswand_, which flowed to the ice floor from the upper\r\ncave in several waves. It was some six meters wide and twenty-five\r\nmeters long; and it was not steep, perhaps fifteen degrees in the\r\nsteepest portions. On the slope some old, nearly obliterated steps were\r\nvisible, and at these Misura proceeded to cut, and with torch in one\r\nhand and axe in the other, gradually worked his way up, until he once\r\nmore reached the level spot whence we had looked down the ice slope.\r\nHere he stood waving his torch, a proceeding indeed he did constantly\r\nthroughout the trip, for he seemed exceedingly proud of the beauties of\r\nhis cavern. This waving of torches, however, is exceedingly foolish,\r\nas their smoke quickly blackens stalactite, and in fact nothing but\r\ncandles and magnesium wire should be carried for lighting purposes\r\nunderground. The ice of the ice slope was hard, gray and opaque, quite\r\ndifferent from that of the ice lake. The ice floor is formed of new\r\nice, which is gradually refilling the place from which Misura said the\r\nice for Buda-Pest was taken out twenty-five years ago. To prove this\r\nassertion, he called my attention to the side of the lake directly\r\nopposite the ice slope. At that spot, under the limestone rubbish over\r\nwhich we came, there was an outcrop of perpendicular opaque ice about a\r\nmeter high. Misura said that the workmen began to cut at the ice slope\r\nand that they dug out a couple of meters in depth from the ice lake,\r\nuntil they had cut back to where the vertical outcrop was standing.\r\n\r\nThe explanation seemed to be in accord with the facts, and if so, it\r\nwould go to show that the ice in this cave is of slow formation and\r\ngreat permanency; as seems also proved by the steps on the ice wall,\r\nwhich--we were the first party in the cave in 1896--had remained over\r\nfrom the preceding summer. Misura told me he had never seen so much\r\nice nor seen it so hard as during our visit, and he added that there\r\nwas generally water on the ice lake, and he thought there would be some\r\nin two or three weeks more. The greatest quantity of ice in the upper\r\ncave was at the head of the ice-slope, and it would seem as though\r\nthere must be cracks or fissures in the overhead rocks there, through\r\nwhich the water is supplied to feed the ice, not only that of the upper\r\ncave, but also the larger portion of that of the lower cave.\r\n\r\nThe heavy winter air would naturally sink down into the entrance\r\npit to the lower cavern, and some of it diverge into the beginning\r\nof the upper cavern, which at first is distinctly a down slope. A\r\nlittle beyond the portal at the head of the ice slope, the upper cave\r\nis either horizontal or in places slightly ascending. Probably this\r\nprevents the cold air from entering further, and probably also, the\r\nheat of the earth neutralizes the cold air of winter beyond a definite\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nThe air in the cave seemed absolutely still throughout; it was\r\nalso extremely dry, undoubtedly because melting had not yet begun.\r\nThe icicles evidently were formed by the slow drip freezing as it\r\ndescended, and there were no perceptible cracks nor fissures in the\r\nrocks underneath them. The facts seem to me to prove that neither\r\nevaporation nor regelation can be the factors at work in making the ice\r\nand we may deduce an important rule therefrom. When a cave is dry, then\r\nthe air is dry; when a cave is wet, then the atmosphere is damp. In\r\nother words, the state of dryness or dampness of glacière atmosphere\r\ndepends on how much the ice is thawing and parting with its moisture.\r\n\r\nOn our return to the base of the long staircase, and while we ascended\r\nit, we had an exquisite moonlight effect, much resembling the one at\r\nthe Schafloch.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRAINER EISLEITHEN.\r\n\r\nAbout two hours by rail, north of Vienna, is the village of Schoenwald,\r\nto which I journeyed on June the 15th, 1896. At the railroad station\r\nthere was a K. K. Post Omnibus in waiting, which, when it was packed\r\nwith passengers and luggage, drove over to Frain in an hour. The\r\nadmirable road lies across a rolling plain, until it reaches the\r\nbrink of the valley of the Thaya, to which it descends in long Alpine\r\nzigzags. On the bluff overlooking the opposite side of the river, there\r\nis a fine _schloss_.\r\n\r\nI secured the seat next to the driver and questioned him about the\r\nEisleithen. Although he had driven on this road for five years, without\r\nvisiting the Eisleithen, yet he was positive that they were warm in\r\nwinter, but cold in summer. He said more than once: _Desto heisser\r\nder Sommer, desto mehr das Eis_, and in fact was an emphatic exponent\r\nof the notions generally held by peasants, which some _savants_ have\r\nadopted and tried to expound. At Frain, I applied at the little hotel\r\nfor a guide, and was entrusted to the care of the hotel boots. He was\r\nan intelligent, talkative youth, but he insisted also that \"the hotter\r\nthe summer, the more ice there is.\" However, he was polite, and made\r\nup for any shortcomings by always addressing me as _der gnädige Herr_.\r\n\r\nThe day was hot, so it took us three-quarters of an hour on foot, along\r\nthe valley of the Thaya, to reach the base of the bluff where the\r\nEisleithen are situated, at an altitude of about four hundred meters.\r\nThe hillside is covered with patches of scrubby forest; and towards\r\nthe summit, the entire mass of the hill is honey-combed with cracks\r\nand the rocks are much broken up. After about ten minutes' ascent up\r\na little path, we came to small holes, from each of which a current\r\nof cool air poured out; these holes seemed fairly horizontal, and the\r\ntemperatures were high enough to prove that there was no ice within.\r\nA little further on, we came to a hole or tiny cave among a pile of\r\nrocks, where there was a painted sign: _Eisgrube_. It went down from\r\nthe mouth, and I put my hand well in, but, beyond the length of my arm,\r\nI could neither see nor measure its shape or depth. The air felt cold,\r\nbut was nowhere near freezing point; nor was it possible to determine\r\nwhether there was a draught: it may or may not be a wind cave. Not\r\nfar from this, there were two gullies, each terminating in a small\r\ncave. The first gully was planned somewhat like certain traps for wild\r\nanimals, that is, it narrowed gradually from the entrance, then became\r\ncovered over; and then dwindled, after some four meters more, into a\r\nsmall descending hole, the end of which we could not reach. But we got\r\nin far enough, to come to large chunks or slabs of ice plastered about\r\non the floor and sides. In this cave, which was sheltered against sun\r\nand wind, the air, as tested by the smoke of a cigar, was motionless,\r\nand the cave seemed unconnected with any air current. The second gully\r\nterminated in a somewhat larger cave, whose floor was well below the\r\nentrance; no ice was visible, however, although the air was still and\r\nthe temperature low. This cave may or may not be a glacière; but surely\r\nit is not a cold current cave.\r\n\r\nThese Frainer Eisleithen certainly offer an interesting field to anyone\r\nstudying subterranean ice, from the fact that there are, in the same\r\nrocks, caves without apparent draughts in summer and containing ice,\r\nand caves with distinct draughts and no ice. The problem seems more\r\nintricate than is usually the case, but the solution is simply that the\r\ntwo classes of caves happen to be found together.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE EISHÖHLE BEI ROTH.\r\n\r\nThe Eifel is one of the bleakest districts of Central Europe, and to\r\none entering it from the vineyards and the well-inhabited basin of the\r\nRhine, the contrast is impressive. The railroad rises gradually to a\r\nland of comparatively desert appearance, with rocks and trees on the\r\nheights and a sparse cultivation in the valleys. But, if the country is\r\nunattractive to the agriculturist, it is interesting to the geologist,\r\non account of the great number of extinct volcanoes. Almost in the\r\ncentre of the Eifel is the little town of Gerollstein, famed for the\r\n_Gerollsteiner Sprudel_, which gives forth an effervescence undreamed\r\nof by anyone, who has not visited the birth place of some of these\r\nGerman table waters.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour's walk from Gerollstein, on the side of a small hill,\r\nis situated the little Eishöhle bei Roth, named after a neighboring\r\nvillage. I went to this place, on the 25th of June, 1896, with a young\r\nboy as guide. The cave is sheltered from the wind by a wood around it,\r\namong which are many large trees. It is at the base of a wall of piled\r\nup lava, or at least volcanic, rocks which form a sort of cauldron. The\r\nentrance is a small tunnel some five meters long, which goes straight\r\ndown at an angle of about twenty-five degrees and then turns sharply to\r\nthe left. At the turn, the cave may be perhaps one meter in height. We\r\ndid not go beyond this spot, where the air was icy and the temperature\r\nsub-normal, as the tunnel was blocked up by a large boulder, which\r\nhad evidently recently fallen from the rocks in front. There was no\r\nice, as far as we went, and the boy said it began three or four meters\r\nfurther in. He told me that there was no ice in the cavern in winter,\r\nbut admitted that he had not entered it at that season, so that was\r\nhearsay. He had heard also that the ice was sometimes taken out for\r\nsick people, but otherwise it was not used.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to me that the conditions at Roth show that the ice is formed\r\nby the cold of winter alone: the cave is well below the entrance; it is\r\nthe lowest point of the surrounding cauldron of rocks and all the cold\r\nair naturally gravitates to it; it is sheltered by rocks and trees\r\nfrom wind or exposure to the rays of the sun; the tunnel faces nearly\r\ndue north; and the water necessary to supply the ice, easily soaks\r\nbetween the lava blocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRAUENMAUERHÖHLE.\r\n\r\nEisenerz, in Eastern Tyrol, is a picturesquely situated little town. It\r\nis at the bottom of a great valley, with mountains all around it. Two\r\nof these are bare, gaunt limestone peaks, which are decidedly dolomitic\r\nin form and color. The sharpest of these is to the north. It is called\r\nthe Pfaffenstein and is the beginning of the range culminating in the\r\nFrauenmauer. On a mountain to the east of the town, one sees the iron\r\nmines and works, whence the town takes its name \"Ironore,\" and whence\r\nquantities of iron are taken out every year. The mines are said to have\r\nbeen in operation for over a thousand years, since about A. D. 800.\r\nAfter the ore is taken from the mine and roughly prepared, it is run\r\ndown in small cars through a covered way to the railroad station to be\r\nshipped; and at certain times there is a seemingly endless procession\r\nof these cars, each bearing, besides its load of ore, a miner, with\r\nclothes and person entirely begrimed to the yellow-brown color of the\r\niron.\r\n\r\nAs I walked out of the Eisenerz railroad station, an old man in\r\nTyrolese costume asked me if I wanted a _träger_ and a guide, so, while\r\nhe was carrying my valise to the hotel, we came to terms. He was one of\r\nthe patented guides of the district and wore the large badge of the\r\nAustrian guides. If the size of the badge made the guide, one should\r\nbe safe with Tyrolese, but for difficult excursions, it will not do\r\nto trust to a guide simply because he happens to be \"patented\"; that\r\nis, not if one values the safety of one's neck. Next morning, July the\r\n9th, 1896, the old guide arrived betimes at the hotel and roused me by\r\ntapping on the wall below my window with his stick. We left at half\r\npast five o'clock. My companion, who should have known better, had not\r\nbreakfasted, so by the time we reached the Gsoll Alp at a quarter-past\r\nseven, he was almost tired out. He wore the regulation black chamois\r\nknee breeches and a _gamsbart_ in his hat. He picked many flowers en\r\nroute, ostensibly because they were pretty; but in reality, I think,\r\nbecause it gave him the opportunity to recover his wind. He told me\r\nhe was sixty-three years old, and he certainly went up hill with some\r\ndifficulty, and for the first time in my life, I fairly succeeded in\r\nshowing a clean pair of heels to a _patentirter führer_ on a mountain\r\nside. At one place he found a large snail in the road. This he wrapped\r\nup in leaves and placed on a rock, and on our return he picked the\r\nleaves and snail up, and rammed the whole bundle into his pocket,\r\ninforming me that it was excellent _Arznei_, although he did not\r\nmention for what complaint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FRAUENMAUER AND THE GSOLL ALP.]\r\n\r\nThe road led up a wooded valley, in a sort of series of steps,\r\nbits of even ground interspersed by steeper ones, with the\r\nPfaffenstein-Frauenmauer limestone peaks poking up their jagged summits\r\non the left. The sky was clear at starting, except in the west, where\r\nclouds were forming, and these gradually overspread the whole sky, and\r\nfinally turned to rain. Just before we reached the Gsoll Alp, we went\r\nby a huge snow avalanche, which had fallen in February and torn a lane\r\nclear through the pines, bringing down numbers of them with it. The\r\nremains of the avalanche were banked up on the side of the road, which\r\nwas cut out, and many of the pines were still piled on and in the snow.\r\nStopping ten minutes at the alp to allow my guide to recuperate on some\r\nbread and milk, we then crossed the pastures and pushed up a rather\r\nsteep slope by a small path, at one place crossing the remains of\r\nanother avalanche. We also came near having the attentions of a little\r\nbull which was screaming viciously. My guide said it was an extremely\r\ndisagreeable beast, but he did not think it would attack him, as he\r\nalways made a point of giving it bread when at the châlet. We reached\r\nthe entrance of the cave at a quarter-past eight.\r\n\r\nA man and a boy from Eisenerz, who had heard I was going to the cavern\r\nand who wished to profit by my guide, caught up with us here. They were\r\nmuch disappointed when I told them I should visit only the _Eiskammer_.\r\nThey went into the cave at the same time that we did, and eventually\r\nwe left them pushing up one of the side chambers, with only one torch\r\nin their possession. My guide said he thought they were risking their\r\nlives, as there were many holes they might fall into, besides the\r\nprobability of their finding themselves in total darkness. He told me\r\nthat once, while in the cavern, he heard distant yells, and, going up\r\nthe gallery whence they proceeded, found a man half dead, who said\r\nhe had tried to come through the mountain by himself, had broken his\r\nlantern and had remained in the darkness an indefinite number of hours;\r\na situation, the horror of which could not be realized by anyone\r\nwho has not been underground without a light and felt the absolute\r\nblackness of a cavern.\r\n\r\nThe Frauenmauer is a limestone peak, 1828 meters in height, one of\r\nseveral forming a horseshoe round the Gsoll Alp. It presents on that\r\nside a sheer wall of rock, in which there are two holes close together,\r\nat an altitude of 1335 meters. These are the lower openings of the\r\nFrauenmauerhöhle, of which the higher and biggest one is used for\r\nan entrance. They are some thirty or forty meters from the base of\r\nthe rock wall, and a flight of wooden steps leads up to the entrance\r\nopening, which is narrow and high. At the top of the steps, we stood\r\nin the mouth of the cave; and, going in four or five meters, saw the\r\nother opening to the left, below us. About five meters further, there\r\nwas one small lump of ice, as big as a pumpkin, lying on the ground,\r\nbut this may have been carried there from within. The cavern went\r\nnearly straight for some twenty-five meters from the entrance, rising\r\nall the time gently. Then came a steep little drop, of some four or\r\nfive meters, in the rock floor, and here a small wooden staircase was\r\nplaced. A gallery opened to the right and this was the cavern proper,\r\nwhich leads through the mountain. It rose considerably and contained\r\nno ice as far as we went, which was for some distance. The walking was\r\nbad, as the floor was covered with _geröll_, that is broken detritus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN THE FRAUENMAUERHÖHLE.\r\n\r\n  From a Photograph by A. Kurka.\r\n]\r\n\r\nReturning and continuing towards the freezing chamber, the floor of the\r\ncavern began to rise once more, continuing for some forty-five meters\r\nto its highest point, which is lower, however, than the top of the\r\nentrance, an important fact to notice. For, although the floor of the\r\ncave is considerably higher, at a distance of seventy meters within,\r\nthan the level of the bottom of the entrance; still, that highest spot\r\nis below the level of the top of the entrance. This fact, and also the\r\nsize of the gallery, unquestionably explains why the cold air can get\r\nin as far as it does. At this highest spot we found a considerable mass\r\nof ice, a couple of cartloads in bulk perhaps, which the guide said\r\nwould melt away later in the summer. This was, perhaps, the remains\r\nof a fallen stalactite. This mass of ice is an interesting point in\r\nconnection with the Frauenmauerhöhle, for it shows that ice in a cave\r\nsometimes forms, even if in small quantities, above the level of the\r\nbase of the entrance. There seems no reason why it should not do so,\r\nprovided there is the necessary water supply. Such ice would, however,\r\nsuffer more, as soon as the outside air was over freezing point, than\r\nwould ice which was below the level of the entrance. It would probably\r\ndisappear early in the year, unless the cave were in a latitude or at\r\nan altitude where snow remained in the open during most of the year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Vertical Section of the Frauenmauerhöhle.]\r\n\r\nFrom this highest point, the cave turns somewhat to the left, and the\r\nfloor begins to slope downward, sinking gradually to some six meters\r\nbelow the level of the entrance. Ten meters or so from the highest\r\npoint, we began to find icicles and fissure columns, and about twenty\r\nmeters further, we reached an almost level ice floor, stretching across\r\nthe entire width of the cave--some seven meters--and extending about\r\nfifty meters more to the end of the cave. In several places there was\r\nmuch frozen rime on the rock walls. There were also a number of columns\r\nand icicles, though none of any special beauty. I broke a piece off one\r\nof them, and the ice was transparent and free from prisms, showing that\r\nthis column was probably of fairly recent origin. Letting a bit melt in\r\nmy mouth, the water tasted pure and sweet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ICE STALACTITE, FRAUENMAUERHÖHLE.\r\n\r\n  From a Photograph by A. Kurka.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn two places, there were _abgrunds_, that is, holes in the ice. One\r\nof these was a wide, deep hole on the left side of the cave, between\r\nthe rock and the ice floor. The other was a great hole in the ice floor\r\nitself. As the edges of both holes sloped sharply, it was impossible\r\nto get near enough to look into either, but I threw in lumps of ice,\r\nand from the sound should judge that the holes were about three meters\r\ndeep. The hole in the ice floor seemed to be cut by drip, and I think\r\nthey both carried off the drainage.\r\n\r\nThe ice floor was sloppy and thawing rapidly. At the furthest point we\r\nreached, within about fifteen meters from the end of the ice chamber,\r\nwe were stopped by an accumulation of water lying on the ice. I poked\r\ninto it with my ice axe and found it about twenty centimeters in depth.\r\nThere was a crust of ice on top in places. The lake was cold, but I am\r\nsure the water was not freezing, as I held my hand in it at least a\r\nminute without pain. The guide assured me that in two weeks or so the\r\nlake would be completely frozen, provided there was some fine, warm\r\nweather; but, if there was rain, he said that it would not freeze. By\r\nthis statement, he unintentionally explained, what he asserted was\r\ntrue, namely, that the cave froze harder in August than in July. The\r\nexplanation of course is, that in fine, dry weather, water does not run\r\ninto the cavern, and then the lake gradually drains off, leaving the\r\nice floor free from water; and this the natives interpret to mean that\r\nthe water has frozen up.\r\n\r\nAt the edge of the lake there was a fissure in the left hand rock\r\nwall, in which my companion assured me that a column would shortly\r\nform. I absolutely doubt this statement, as, if it were true, it\r\nwould be contrary to everything I have seen; still, I wish I could\r\nhave returned in August, to verify the matter. I poked my torch up\r\nthe fissure, also felt in with my hand. It was cold, and on the rocks\r\ninside there was much hoar frost, but I could neither see nor feel any\r\nice mass, nor am I sure how far the fissure extended.\r\n\r\nThe air was still, damp and over freezing point throughout the\r\n_Eiskammer_, and all the signs showed that the cave was in a state\r\nof thaw. Although the rocks are limestone and scarcely blackened by\r\nsmoke anywhere, yet as our torches did not give much light, the color\r\nimpression was black and gray, like the Schafloch.\r\n\r\nAt the hotel the landlord confirmed in every particular the story of\r\nthe cave freezing hardest in August or September. He had never been\r\nthere himself, but stated that everyone said the same thing, and\r\nthat many people had \"broken their heads\" trying to account for it.\r\nAt eight o'clock in the evening, my guide came to let me know that\r\nthe man and boy, whom we left trying to penetrate the cave, had just\r\nturned up after making all their relatives extremely anxious. They\r\nwere nearly lost, and had in general an extremely uncomfortable time.\r\nIt is scarcely to be wondered at that accidents occur in caves and on\r\nmountains when people, with neither knowledge nor proper preparation,\r\ngo wandering off by themselves into the unknown.[4]\r\n\r\n[4] On the evening of June 29th, 1897, I met at Hieflau three Viennese\r\ntourists who had come that day through the Frauenmauer. They found the\r\nlake on the ice floor of the _Eiskammer_, just as I had in 1896. They\r\nsaid also, moreover, that they found ice and icicles or ice columns\r\nin the main cave; unfortunately, they did not explain clearly in what\r\npart.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILCHHÄUSER OF SEELISBERG.\r\n\r\nThe summer of 1896, will long be remembered by Alpine climbers for\r\nthe pitiless rain storm, which kept coming steadily down during the\r\nvacation months. It was in the midst of this that I arrived at Trieb,\r\non the Lake of Lucerne, on the 6th of August, to see whether I could\r\nfind the windholes which were reported near Seelisberg. At the landing\r\nplace I found Herr J. M. Ziegler, the owner of the Hotel Bellevue at\r\nSeelisberg, who promptly secured a nice, blond bearded young fellow,\r\na relative of his and his _knecht_, as a guide. It was pouring when\r\nwe started, a proceeding which kept on during our entire excursion.\r\nWe tramped up a narrow road, paved with great stones in the old Swiss\r\nfashion, and, as my guide truly said, awfully steep for horses.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour from the boat landing, took us to the first milkhouse,\r\nwhich belonged to Herr Ziegler. It was in a small patch of woods, and\r\nwas placed against a cliff, where rocks had fallen down and formed a\r\ntalus of broken detritus. The side walls of the house were built out\r\nfrom the cliff and roofed over, and the front wall had a doorway closed\r\nwith a wooden door. At the back the detritus or _geröll_ was built into\r\na vertical, unplastered wall between most of the interstices of which,\r\ncool air came forth. Several of these interstices were fairly large\r\nholes of uncertain depth. It was a cool day and the air currents were\r\nonly a little cooler than the temperature outside.\r\n\r\nAnother half an hour of uphill walking, partly on roads and partly\r\nover soaking meadows, took us to Seelisberg, where we stopped at the\r\nhouse of the owner of the second milkhouse, to get the key. The owner\r\ncould not go with us because he had damaged his foot, by wearing great\r\nwooden shoes or _sabots_ armed with enormous spikes, while cutting\r\ngrass on steep slopes. He was hospitable enough: unlike his dog, who\r\nwas exceedingly anxious to attack us. The owner said--in the intervals\r\nof the dog's howls--that ice formed during the winter in the rear wall\r\nof his milkhouse and remained until about June. The milkhouse was in\r\na little patch of woods against a small cliff, at the bottom of which\r\nwere broken rocks. We had some difficulty in getting in, working for\r\nat least ten minutes at the lock, while drops of rain-water would\r\noccasionally drip into our coat collars. Just as I had given up hope,\r\nmy companion succeeded in getting the key to turn. There were several\r\npans, full of milk, placed to cool, and several barrels of potatoes;\r\nand, as at the first milkhouse, we found that the rear wall consisted\r\nsimply of heaped up detritus built into a vertical position. Gentle air\r\ncurrents flowed from several large holes and from the cracks between\r\nthe stones.\r\n\r\nFrom here we went by a path through woods and over meadows down to the\r\nlake, coming to the shore some distance to the west of the steamboat\r\nlanding. Everything was soaking wet, and as we proceeded, I felt my\r\nclothes getting wetter and my shoes absorbing water like sponges until,\r\nwhen we came to an overflowing brook, wading through seemed rather\r\npleasant. There is one advantage of getting thoroughly wet feet in the\r\nmountains: it makes crossing streams so much easier, as one does not\r\ndelay, but simply steps right in.\r\n\r\nThe lower milkhouse was on the shore of the lake, near the house of\r\na fisherman, whose wife opened the door for us. There was some milk\r\nin pans and several barrels of wine; and on a board were a number of\r\n_ferras_ from the lake; the result of two days' catching in nets. This\r\nwas the largest of the three milkhouses; although it did not have as\r\nmany big holes in the rock wall as the others, but only the interstices\r\nbetween the blocks of rock, whence we could feel cool air flowing out.\r\nThe woman said that the ice melted away by April or May, but that in\r\nwinter the wine barrels were all covered with frost. She also said that\r\nthe air coming from the clefts in summer was colder when the weather\r\nwas warm, than when it was rainy. Doubtless the temperature of the\r\ndraughts remains the same during the summer, but the air feels cooler\r\nto the hand when the outside air is hot.\r\n\r\nA walk of another half hour, through more soaking wet grass, brought\r\nus back to the steamboat landing at Trieb, where I touched my guide's\r\nheart with the gift of a five franc piece, and had a talk with Herr\r\nZiegler. He said that there were a number of places in the neighborhood\r\nwhence cold air came forth during the summer from cracks in the rocks:\r\nthat there were also other milkhouses, notably one at Tell's Platte, on\r\nthe lake: and that the milkhouses were not generally used in winter,\r\nwhen the doors were left open, to allow the cold air to penetrate as\r\nmuch as possible through the rocks behind. During the winter the\r\ndraughts were reversed, and poured in instead of out of the openings,\r\nand Herr Ziegler thought that at that time the interior of the rock\r\ncracks became chilled, and that possibly ice formed in them which\r\nhelped to chill the summer currents, when the draughts poured out from\r\nthe holes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GLACIÈRE DE LA GENOLLIÈRE.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday, the 11th of August, 1896, a cool and rainy day, I left\r\nGeneva and went by train to Nyon, where I found at the station a little\r\nvictoria, in which I drove up to Saint-Cergues. The road lay across\r\nthe plain to the base of the slopes of the Jura, and then up these in\r\nlong zigzags; it was admirably built and on the hill slopes passed\r\nthe whole way through a beautiful thick forest, principally beeches\r\nand birches. At Saint-Cergues, I went to the Pension Capt, where\r\nthe landlady soon found a guide in the shape of the gendarme of the\r\ndistrict, a right good fellow, Amy Aimée Turrian by name. He was in\r\nuniform, with an army revolver in a holster at his belt. We then drove\r\nabout half an hour beyond Saint-Cergues, the road rising but little,\r\nand the thick forest giving place to a more open wood of evergreens,\r\nwith patches of pasturage. As a forest sanitarium, Saint-Cergues seems\r\nunsurpassed in the whole of Europe. The carriage turned up a little\r\ncountry road, which soon became too rough for driving, so we proceeded\r\non foot for about another half hour, through pine woods and pastures,\r\nto the glacière. Turrian enlivened the way with an account of his life\r\nas a gendarme, of the long solitary six hour patrols in the woods in\r\nwinter, and of how he lay in ambush for poachers. He said he would not\r\ntake long to fire on anyone resisting arrest, as that was _sérieux_.\r\n\r\nThe glacière is in the middle of a pasture, with several pine trees\r\noverhanging it. It is surrounded by a wall, built to prevent the cows\r\nfrom falling in. There are two pits, side by side and about three\r\nmeters apart: they are some thirteen meters in depth, with a width of\r\nfive or six meters. They open into one another at the bottom; the rock\r\nseparating them, forming a natural bridge overhead. One of the pits is\r\nvertical on all sides. The other is vertical all around, except on the\r\nside furthest away from the natural bridge. Here the side of the pit\r\nis in the shape, so usual in glacières, of a steep slope. Down this\r\nslope we descended. It was slippery and muddy, owing to the recent\r\nheavy rains, and my ice axe proved invaluable and probably saved me\r\nsome unpleasant falls. Under the bridge, the floor was covered with a\r\nmass of shattered limestone debris, among which there was neither ice\r\nnor snow; both of which my guide said he had found in abundance the\r\npreceding June. A little limestone cavern opened on one side below the\r\nbridge. A great, flat limestone slab formed a natural lintel, and,\r\nlighting our candles, we stooped down and passed under it into the\r\ncave, which was about the size of a room and in which we could just\r\nstand up. At the entrance and over most of the floor there was ice, in\r\none place thirty or forty centimeters in depth, as I could see where a\r\ndrip from the roof had cut a hole. There were no signs of icicles or\r\ncolumns. My guide said he had never penetrated into this chamber, which\r\nhe thought, on his earlier visit, was blocked with ice and snow. I did\r\nnot see any limestone stalactites anywhere, and I am inclined to think\r\nthat the low temperatures of glacières have a tendency to prevent their\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nAfter our visit, we went to the Châlet de La Genollière close by, where\r\nthere were some thirty cows and calves. The intelligent _berger_ or\r\nmanager said that most of the ice from the glacière was used for butter\r\nmaking during the hot weather; and that between the inroads thus made\r\nupon it and from other causes, the ice disappeared every year before\r\nautumn, but that it formed afresh every winter; pretty good evidence to\r\nshow that the ice in this cave has nothing to do with a glacial period.\r\nHe also stated that when he first entered the inner chamber in the\r\nspring there were four ice columns there.\r\n\r\nThe glacière de La Genollière is a clear exemplification of the theory\r\nthat the cold of winter is the sole cause for the ice. The whole\r\nglacière is rather small and is fairly well protected against wind.\r\nAlthough snow cannot fall directly under the rock arch, yet I should\r\nimagine it drifts under, or after melting, runs in and refreezes. To\r\nthe inner cave snow, as snow, could hardly reach; and the cavern is\r\nprobably filled, like most cave glacières, from frozen drip. The inner\r\ncave is, therefore, a true cave glacière, while the outer pits and the\r\nbridge are something between a gorge and a cave. La Genollière should,\r\nI think, be visited about the end of June, when the ice formations are\r\ncertainly larger and more interesting than in August.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FRIEDRICHSTEINER OR GOTTSCHEER EISHÖHLE.\r\n\r\nA little to the east of, and in about the same latitude as Trieste,\r\nis the small town of Gottschee, now reached by a branch railroad from\r\nLaibach. Gottschee is a German settlement almost in the centre of\r\nthe district known as the Duchy of Krain, Austria, which is mainly\r\ninhabited in the north by Slavonians and in the south by Croatians.\r\nGottschee lies directly at the western base of the Friedrichsteiner\r\nGebirge, one of whose peaks is the Burgernock. On the eastern slopes of\r\nthis mountain is situated the Friedrichsteiner or Gottscheer Eishöhle,\r\nat an altitude of about nine hundred meters.\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of June, 1897, I left Gottschee at half past six o'clock in\r\nthe morning with Stefan Klenka, a nice little man. I had asked to have\r\nhim come at six o'clock, but he did not turn up and I had to send for\r\nhim. His excuse was, that tourists always ordered him for six o'clock,\r\nbut when the time came, they were still in bed. He had taken a German\r\nofficer and his wife to the cave the year before, and after keeping\r\nhim waiting three hours, they started at nine o'clock. The result was\r\nthat they did not get to the cave until two o'clock, and returned to\r\nGottschee just at nightfall.\r\n\r\nWe reached the cave at half past eight o'clock. The steep and rough\r\npath went uphill through a fine forest, which my guide said was\r\n_Urwald_, _i. e._, primeval forest; and there were certainly some\r\nbig trees and many fallen ones, and much underbrush. He assured me\r\nthat bears were still plentiful in the neighborhood, and that Prince\r\nAuersperg, who owns the shooting, does not allow them to be killed,\r\npreferring to pay for any damage they may cause to the peasants'\r\nfields or for any cattle they may dine on, rather than to have these\r\ninteresting animals exterminated from his woods. He also said that\r\nthere was a two meter snowfall in Gottschee in winter: a sufficient\r\nquantity to account for the glacières. At one place on the road we\r\nstopped before a small crack in the rocks, and Klenka dropped in some\r\nsmall stones, which we could hear strike two or three times a long\r\ndistance below. There is surely an unexplored cavern at this spot.\r\n\r\nThe Friedrichsteiner Eishöhle is a large pit cave, well lighted by\r\ndaylight. It is sheltered from any winds by the great trees which grow\r\nall around it and even over the rock roof. A long, steep slope leads\r\nstraight into the pit and from the top the ice floor is in full sight.\r\nOn both sides of the slope the rocks are almost sheer. Over the bottom\r\nof the slope the rock roof projects at a great height. The sides of the\r\ncave rise perpendicularly at least forty meters, and in fact, the cave\r\nsuggests an unfinished tunnel set on end.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, the _Deutschen und Oesterreichischen Alpen Verein_\r\nbuilt a wooden staircase, in a series of zigzags, on the slope. This\r\nstaircase should have been cleared off earlier in the year, but, of\r\ncourse, the matter was neglected. Down these steps we descended until\r\nthey became covered with snow, and lower down with hard ice. All this\r\nwas winter's snow which fell directly on to the slope and gradually\r\nmelted and froze again, so this was really a miniature glacier. It was\r\nnot subterranean ice at all. We cut down the snow, but had to stop when\r\nwe came to the ice, as it would have involved a couple of hours at\r\nleast of the hardest kind of step cutting; and this my guide did not\r\ncare to undertake, especially as he was nearly killed on this slope the\r\nweek before. He had reached, with some tourists from Trieste, a place\r\nabove that where we stopped, when he slipped and fell down the slope,\r\nshooting clear across the cave, where he remained until ropes were\r\nprocured, and he was dragged out. He afterwards showed me the numerous\r\ncuts and bruises he had received on his perilous glissade.\r\n\r\nWe had to stop also for another reason. I had unwisely brought as wrap,\r\na thick overcoat reaching to the knees, and this was such an impediment\r\non the icy staircase, that I took it off, and soon began to feel long\r\nshivers creeping down my spine. This question of extra clothing for\r\nglacière exploration is hard to arrange. One must guard against most\r\ntrying changes of temperature. For, on entering a big glacière, the\r\nheat of a July day without, will, at a distance of only a few meters,\r\ngive place to the cold of a January day within, and nothing could be\r\nbetter devised than a big glacière to lay the seeds of rheumatism.\r\nIt is difficult to plan a garb suitable to meet all the varying\r\nconditions, but the dress must be cool and warm, and light enough to\r\npermit free motion. The clothes I have found most practical are a thin\r\nwaistcoat and thick trousers, and two short sack coats, one of them\r\na heavy winter one. The coats should button at the throat, and it is\r\nwell to place straps round the bottom of the trousers. Thick kid gloves\r\nshould always be worn in caves, to save cutting the hands on rocks or\r\nice in the darkness, and hobnails may prevent some unpleasant slips.\r\n\r\nFrom the point where we stopped, some ten meters away from the ice\r\nfloor, the largest portion of the cave was visible. The finest object\r\nwas a big ice curtain or _vorhang_, as my guide called it, which, from\r\na height of five or six meters, flowed down from fissures to the ice\r\nfloor, and which covered the rocks on the eastern side. Under one point\r\nof this curtain, Klenka said that there was a deep hole in the ice.\r\nSmaller fissure columns also streamed from the rear wall to the ice\r\nfloor. The ice floor itself was flat, of an ochre greenish tinge, and\r\nwas covered with broken ice fragments. We could not see the western\r\nportion of the cavern, as the rocks jutted out in a sort of corner.\r\nKlenka said that there were several small pyramids there; a large one\r\nwhich he spoke of as the _Altar_; and a small ice slope, plastered on\r\nthe side rocks.\r\n\r\nThe sides of the cave were of a dark gray limestone rock, and from\r\nthe top of the slope they assumed a decidedly bluish tone, and I\r\nam inclined to think that there was already--we were there from\r\neight-thirty A. M. until ten A. M.--a faint mist in the cavern. This\r\nis the most interesting phenomenon connected with the Friedrichsteiner\r\nEishöhle. The cavern faces due south, and about midday, in clear\r\nweather, the sun shines directly into it, causing a mist or cloud to\r\nform in the cave on warm days; a mute witness that evaporation is\r\nconnected with the melting, not with the forming, of the ice. The air\r\nat every point seemed still.\r\n\r\nOn my return to Gottschee, I called on one of the professors of the\r\nK. K. Gymnasium, and he told me many interesting facts about the\r\nsurrounding country. Among other things he said that no traces of a\r\nglacial period or indeed of glaciers were found in the Krain; and as\r\nthis district is particularly rich in glacières, this fact is a strong\r\nproof against the glacial period theory. He assured me also that many\r\nbears still existed in the neighborhood; that one family was known to\r\ninhabit the woods round the Friedrichsteiner Eishöhle, and that he had\r\noften seen bear tracks on his own shooting, some ten kilometers to the\r\nsouth.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUCHENREUTHER EISLOCH.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of June, 1897, I left Gottschee at six-thirty A. M. in an\r\n_einspänner_, and drove thirteen kilometers southward, over a good\r\nroad, albeit hilly in places, to Mrauen, which we reached in about\r\ntwo hours. The weather was exceedingly hot. I took Klenka along, as\r\nhe spoke German, and he entertained me on the drive by telling me\r\nthat there were many poisonous snakes in the country, of which the\r\n_kreuzotters_ or vipers were the worst, and that three or four persons\r\nwere bitten every year.\r\n\r\nMrauen is in Croatia, and I could see a slight difference in the people\r\nand their dress from those of Gottschee. From Mrauen, the landlord of\r\nthe _Gasthaus Post_, Josef Sirar, led us to the Grosses Eisloch. This\r\nis sometimes spoken of as the Eisloch bei Skrill, but as it lies in\r\na patch of woods below the village of Suchenreuth, the Suchenreuther\r\nEisloch seems the correct name. At least that was what Sirar called it.\r\nIt took us about an hour on foot from Mrauen to get into the woods.\r\nOn the way we met two guards in uniform, carrying Männlicher carbines\r\nwith fixed bayonets, and it was agreeable to feel that the strong arm\r\nof the Austrian government extended over this semi-wild land. In the\r\nwoods, following Sirar's able guidance, we took a short cut--always a\r\nmistake--and were lost temporarily in a maze of bushes and brambles, in\r\nwhich I thought of the _kreuzotters_. After that, Sirar at first could\r\nnot find the cave and had to hunt around for it, while I sat on a stone\r\nand waited impatiently.\r\n\r\nAt the cave a rather steep slope of wet mud, covered with dead leaves,\r\nled down through a rock arch. Sirar had to cut several steps in the\r\nmud with his hatchet, or we should probably have sat down suddenly.\r\nThe archway opened into a moderately large cavern, which was about\r\ntwenty meters deep, almost round and some fifteen meters in diameter.\r\nThe slope continued right across the cave, and on some parts of it\r\nwere logs of wood and much débris. On the wall hung a few limestone\r\nstalactites. In the roof of the cave was a great hole, and under\r\nthis was a big cone of old winter snow, which had become icy in its\r\nconsistency, and on which there was much dirt and many leaves. The\r\ntemperature in the cave was several degrees above freezing point, and\r\nthere was no ice hanging anywhere. Sirar said that when the weather got\r\nhotter, the ice would come; but as he said also, that he had been only\r\nonce before in the cave, some ten years ago, his opinion was not worth\r\nmuch. Both men said that the preceding winter was unusually warm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6. Vertical Section of the Suchenreuther Eisloch.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NIXLOCH.\r\n\r\nNear Hallthurm in Bavaria, a railroad station between Reichenhall and\r\nBerchtesgaden, is a well known congeries of windholes, called the\r\nNixloch. I visited it on Friday, July the 2d, 1897, with a railroad\r\nemployee, whom I found at the peasants' _gasthaus_.\r\n\r\nThe Nixloch is ten minutes distant in the forest, on the slopes of the\r\nUntersberg. It is among a mass of big limestone blocks, and close by\r\nare the remains of the walls of an old castle or fortification. The\r\nNixloch descends from the entrance for about two meters nearly sheer,\r\nand there is just room to get through. As I sat within the outside edge\r\nof the mouth of the cave, the smoke of my cigar was slowly carried\r\ndownward into it.\r\n\r\nDropping down through the hole, we found ourselves in a small cavern\r\nformed of rough limestone blocks overhead and underfoot. It is possible\r\nto go still further down and my companion said that formerly it was\r\npossible to go through the cave and come out at a lower opening; this\r\nexit, however, was destroyed when the railroad was built. The draught,\r\nas tested by the flame of a candle, was still drawing in some seven or\r\neight meters from the entrance. There is a second cavity immediately\r\nnext to the entrance, and at the bottom of these holes, the inward\r\ndraught was so violent as to blow the candle out. The thermometer\r\noutside in the shade was 28°C.; inside the cave, where the draught was\r\nstill perceptible, it was about 20°C. Within the cave I noticed two\r\nlarge, dark brown spiders.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the _gasthaus_, I had a talk with some peasants who\r\nwere dining there, and they told me that it was warm in winter in the\r\nNixloch, and that ice never formed there.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DORNBURG.\r\n\r\nIf one draws a line northeast from Coblentz and another northwest from\r\nFrankfort-on-the-Main, they will intersect nearly at the Dornburg. The\r\nrailroad from Frankfort goes, via Limburg and Hadamar, to Frickhofen\r\nand Wilsenroth, from either of which villages the ice formations of the\r\nDornburg are easily reached on foot in half an hour.\r\n\r\nI arrived at Wilsenroth on the 26th of July, 1897, and soon found\r\nan old forester, who said he had lived in the neighborhood for over\r\nfifty years, to show me the way. The Dornburg is a low hill, perhaps a\r\nhundred meters high and a kilometer long. It is basaltic and covered\r\nwith sparse woods. The forester said that on top were the remains of\r\nthe foundations of an old castle, and that this was possibly the origin\r\nof the name Dornburg. We circled round the eastern base of the hill\r\nfor some ten minutes, when we came to a little depression, filled with\r\nbasalt debris, among which were several small holes, out of which came\r\ncurrents of cool air.\r\n\r\nTen minutes further in the woods, we arrived at the _Dornburg\r\nRestauration_ and then almost immediately at the glacière. It is at the\r\nbottom of a talus of broken basaltic rocks and has been much affected\r\nby the agency of man. In it are two _eislöcher_ or _stollen_, as the\r\nforester called them. These are little artificial pits or cellars, dug\r\ninto the talus. They are side by side, opening about southeast, and\r\neach is about one and a half meters wide, three meters long, and two\r\nmeters high. The sides are built up with wooden posts and overhead is\r\na thick roof of logs strewn with dirt. The day was cool and at the\r\nmouth of each _eisloch_, a faint outward current of air was discernible\r\nat nine-thirty A. M. I could not find any currents coming into the\r\n_eislöcher_. Inside it was cold and damp, and evidently thawing. There\r\nwas a good heap of ice in each _eisloch_; it was clear, and I could\r\ndetect no trace of prisms.\r\n\r\nBy much questioning, I dug out something of the history of these\r\n_stollen_ from the forester. Formerly the ice was found at this spot,\r\namong the boulders at the base of the slope. But the people gradually\r\ntook many of these basaltic blocks away, to break up for road making,\r\nand then the ice diminished. About 1870, a brewery, since burnt, was\r\nbuilt at the Dornburg and the brewer had these _stollen_ built, a sort\r\nof semi-natural, semi-artificial ice house. Every winter, the present\r\nowner of the _stollen_ throws a quantity of snow into them, and this\r\nhelps materially in forming the mass of ice.\r\n\r\nJust below the restaurant there is a spring, which was said to be\r\nextremely cold, but there was nothing icy nor apparently unusual about\r\nit.\r\n\r\nUnder the restaurant itself is an interesting cellar. It was closed by\r\nwooden doors. First there was a passage way which turned steadily to\r\nthe right, and which we descended by some ten steps. This was about\r\ntwo meters wide and was full of beer bottles and vegetables. On the\r\nleft of the passage was a large double chamber where meat is kept. At\r\neleven-thirty A. M. a faint draught blew down the passage and into the\r\nhall, the outside door being then open. The double hall was perhaps six\r\nmeters each way, and I could detect no air currents coming into it at\r\nany place, except from the passage way. Both passage and halls were, as\r\nfar as I could see, entirely built over with masonry. There was no ice\r\nand the temperature was some 7° or 8° above freezing point.\r\n\r\nThe daughter of the proprietor of the restaurant said that ice began\r\nto form in the cellar in February and that it lasted generally until\r\nOctober; but that this year it was destroyed early because the masonry\r\nwas repaired, although it was still possible to skate in the cellar as\r\nlate as March. In the beginning of winter the cellar was warm, and as\r\nshe expressed it, _der Keller schwitzt dann_, which I suppose means\r\nthat the walls are damp. She also said that it was a _naturlicher\r\nKeller_, and I am inclined to think that it was a natural glacière,\r\nconverted into a cellar.\r\n\r\nThis visit to the Dornburg gave me many new ideas about classifying\r\nglacières, especially in relation to the movements of air. I was\r\nlong puzzled by the German terms, _Eishöhlen_ and _Windröhren_; and\r\nit suddenly struck me, at the Dornburg, that this terminology is\r\nincorrect, when used as a classification of glacières. The presence or\r\nabsence of strong, apparent draughts, cannot be considered as a test\r\nas to whether a place is or is not a glacière; the presence of ice,\r\nfor at least part of the year, alone makes a glacière, and this it\r\ndoes whether there are or are not draughts. It seems to me more than\r\never clear, however, that it all depends on the movements of air, as\r\nto whether ice forms in a cave. If the movements of air take the cold\r\nair of winter into a cave, then and then only--provided there is also\r\na water supply--do we have ice. I am now inclined to think that caves,\r\nas far as their temperatures are concerned, should be classified into\r\ncaves containing ice, cold caves, ordinary normal caves, and hot caves,\r\nwithout reference to the movements of air.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GLACIÈRE DE SAINT-GEORGES.\r\n\r\nFrom Rolle, on the north shore of the Lake of Geneva; an excellent\r\ncarriage road leads in two hours and a half to Saint-Georges in the\r\nJura. At first the way goes steeply uphill and passes through many\r\nvineyards, and afterwards it crosses level fields to Gimel, then rises\r\nthrough woods to Saint-Georges. On arriving there on the afternoon of\r\nAugust 3d, 1897, I found the street filled with evergreens, and long\r\nbenches and tables; the débris of a _fête de tir_, which had lasted for\r\ntwo days, with dancing and banquets and, I suspect, much _vin du pays_.\r\n\r\nWhen I got down stairs at six o'clock next morning, all the people\r\nof the inn were sound asleep recovering from the effects of the\r\n_fête_, and instead of their calling me, I had to call them. Finally I\r\nsucceeded in getting breakfast and then started in company with a first\r\nrate fellow, named Aymon Émery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LA GLACIÈRE DE SAINT-GEORGES.\r\n\r\n  From a Photograph by E. Truand.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe walked up through woods, in about an hour and a half, to the\r\nGlacière de Saint-Georges, which lies at an altitude of 1287 meters in\r\nthe midst of the forest. There are two holes close together. One of\r\nthese descends vertically and is partly roofed over with logs on which\r\nis rigged a pulley. Émery, who was the _entrepreneur_ of the glacière,\r\nwhich means that he attended to getting out the ice, told me that they\r\npulled the ice up through this vertical hole, making a noose with a\r\nrope round each block.\r\n\r\nThe other and shallower opening ended in a rock floor, which was\r\nreached by a short ladder. To the right was an arch, under which the\r\nrock terminated as a floor and descended vertically, forming the wall\r\nof the cave. On this wall two ladders, spliced at the end into one long\r\nladder, were placed in a nearly vertical position. I tied the end of my\r\nrope round my waist, and got a workman, who had come to cut ice, to pay\r\nout the rope to me, while I went down.\r\n\r\nThe cave is rather long and narrow, perhaps twenty-five meters by\r\ntwelve meters, and the limestone roof forms an arched descending curve\r\noverhead. I could not see any limestone stalactites; neither were there\r\nany ice stalactites or stalagmites in the cave, but a good part of the\r\nwall, against which the long ladder was placed, was covered by an ice\r\ncurtain. It was thin and had evidently been damaged by the ice cutters\r\nor I think it would have covered the entire lower portion of the wall.\r\n\r\nThe base of the long ladder rested on an ice floor which filled the\r\nbottom of the cave, and which would probably have been level if it had\r\nnot been cut out here and there in places, leaving many holes. A good\r\nmany broken ice fragments lay on the floor and in some of the holes\r\nwere pools of water. Some of the floor ice was exceedingly prismatic in\r\ncharacter, and I was able to flake it off or break it easily with my\r\nhands into prisms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Vertical Section of the Glacière de\r\nSaint-Georges.]\r\n\r\nUnder the vertical shaft, which is at one end of the cave, was a mass\r\nof winter's snow which had fallen through the opening. Under this snow\r\nwas a deep hole, which I believe was the drain hole of the glacière\r\nbefore the ice floor was cut away to a level below its mouth. Into\r\nthis hole I threw lumps of ice and heard them go bumping down for three\r\nor four seconds.\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere was not uncomfortable, although the temperature was\r\nabout 7° C. The air did not feel damp, and seemed almost still, but\r\nstanding on the ice floor nearly under the vertical hole, I found that\r\nthe smoke from my cigar ascended rapidly, and it seemed as if there\r\nwere a rising air current, which sucked up the smoke.\r\n\r\nSaint-Georges is a fine cavern and well worth visiting. Émery said that\r\nthe ice was not cut out for eight years preceding the summer of 1897,\r\nand that for several years it was not possible to go down at all, as\r\nthere were no ladders, until he put in the two we utilized.[5] All the\r\nnatives of Saint-Georges believed that the ice was a summer formation\r\nand that it was warm in the cave in winter.\r\n\r\n[5] In the illustration of the Glacière de Saint-Georges, the opening\r\nto the left is the vertical pit, through which the ice is taken out:\r\nunderneath it, is the heap of winter snow. The man in the upper part\r\nof the picture is standing on the rock shelf at the base of the upper\r\nladder and at the top of the lower ladder. To the right of the lower\r\nladder near the bottom, a bit of the ice curtain is visible.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GLACIÈRE DU PRÉ DE SAINT-LIVRES.\r\n\r\nFrom the Glacière de Saint-Georges, Émery and I pushed on through the\r\nwoods to the Pré de Saint-Livres. In several places we came on the\r\ntracks of deer, and my guide told me he had killed eleven roe during\r\nthe last hunting season. He said also that an attempt is being made to\r\nintroduce the red deer into the Jura, and that the experiment seemed to\r\nbe meeting with success. We kept to the crest of the ridge along wood\r\npaths, and, as the day was fortunately cool and cloudy, we were able to\r\nwalk fast and reached the Pré de Saint-Livres in two hours. At a spot\r\ncalled La Foiraudaz we met the workmen coming down with a cartload of\r\nice, which they were taking to Bière. Some of this ice was extremely\r\nprismatic.\r\n\r\nThe Pré de Saint-Livres is a big mountain pasture or meadow, surrounded\r\nwith hills covered with pine trees. In the middle of it is the Châlet\r\nde Saint-Livres, round which numerous cows and calves were congregated\r\nand where a small shepherd gave us some milk. The châlet is not one\r\nof the old picturesque Swiss châlets with great stones on the roof to\r\nkeep it from being blown away by the wind, but a strongly built single\r\nstoried stone structure, which looks extremely modern among the green\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nThe glacière lies close to the châlet, on the southern side of the\r\nmeadows, just on the edge of the woods, and is surrounded with trees.\r\nIt is at an altitude of 1362 meters and faces nearly due north. To\r\nprevent the cattle from falling in, it is enclosed with a stone wall,\r\nexcept in front, where there is a fence formed of an abattis of pine\r\ntrees. The cave belongs to the pit variety, and the pit is a big one.\r\nAs you stand at the top, you can look down to the end of the glacière.\r\nThe rocks are vertical all round the pit, and in front there is a small\r\nrock shelf, one-third of the way down, which divides the rock wall\r\ninto two long drops. Against each of these was a rickety ladder, so we\r\nfixed the end of my rope to the pine trees of the fence, and hung on\r\nto it while we climbed down. The base of the lower and longer ladder\r\nrested on a mass of snow. This was the beginning of a long snow slope\r\nwhich gradually turned to ice and filled the cave. The cave itself,\r\nmeasuring along the snow slope, is some forty meters long and some ten\r\nto fifteen meters wide, and is entirely lighted by daylight.\r\n\r\nThe snow and ice slope fell in a series of small waves, and the upper\r\nportion was rather dirty. On the right hand the workmen had fixed a\r\nrope as a handrail, and all the way down had cut a staircase in the\r\nice, so that the descent was not difficult. Some of the ice was sloppy.\r\nThe ice mass did not abut entirely against the end of the cave, but\r\nleft an open space between the ice and the rock, some three or four\r\nmeters wide and some four or five meters deep. Here the workmen had\r\nbeen getting their ice, and had cut into the ice mass for several\r\nmeters, forming a little tunnel.\r\n\r\nThere were no ice cones nor stalactites, neither did I see any\r\nlimestone stalactites. Much of the ice was prismatic; in fact, together\r\nwith that at Saint-Georges, it was the most strongly prismatic I have\r\nseen. I can perhaps best describe it, by saying that it was brittle\r\nin texture, as I could break up small lumps in my hands. There was\r\nmore prismatic ice at Saint-Livres, however, than at Saint-Georges.\r\nThe air in the cave was still and decidedly damp; and the temperature\r\nwas several degrees above freezing point. The day, however, was almost\r\nwindless, and I would not assert that movements of air, due to the\r\nwind, might not sometimes take place in the pit.\r\n\r\nThe Glacière du Pré de Saint-Livres is one of those caves which may\r\nbe looked on as a transitional form between gorges containing ice and\r\ncaves containing ice. The winter snow falls into the mouth of the pit,\r\nand is the chief foundation of the ice mass. It would be interesting\r\nto make a series of observations in this cave to see whether there was\r\nanything like glacier motion. Émery, of his own accord, expressed the\r\nopinion that much of the ice here was due to the winter snows; in fact,\r\nhe thought that it was all due to it, and that it gradually descended\r\ninto the cave and turned, little by little, into ice. He told me that\r\nsome years ago a cow was found by the workmen, frozen into the ice,\r\nat a depth of four meters; the flesh was perfectly preserved, and was\r\neaten. I asked him if he had ever seen insects in either cave, and he\r\nsaid he had not.\r\n\r\nFrom the glacière we walked back to the village of Saint-Georges. On\r\nasking my guide how much I owed him, he said he received four francs\r\nfor a _journée_, so I gave him six francs, and we parted the best of\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLACIER ICE CAVE IN THE FEE GLACIER.\r\n\r\nDuring a rather protracted stay at Saas-Fee in Switzerland, I visited\r\nthe glacier ice cave of the Fee Glacier on the 15th and 16th of\r\nAugust, 1897, both cool and rainy days. It is about half an hour's\r\nwalk from the hotel to the ice cave, which is in the snout of the Fee\r\nglacier, below the Eggfluh. A considerable stream issued from the cave.\r\nOn nearing the opening, a strong cold air current poured out above\r\nthe stream. At the front edge of the ice, the height of the ice roof\r\nin the centre was perhaps twelve meters and the width fifteen meters.\r\nAround the edge, the roof formed an almost perfect curve. The ice walls\r\ncontracted in a regular manner within, and the cave became narrower and\r\nlower, and suggested an enormous funnel cut in half, into which you\r\nlooked from the larger end. The cave also grew gradually darker, and\r\nthe darkness prevented seeing further than to a depth of some fifteen\r\nmeters. In the ice walls, just inside the entrance, were several\r\ncrevasses, of the ordinary blue-green color. They followed nearly the\r\nsame curve as the roof, but did not go through to the outside. There\r\nwere no icicles. The ice was faintly stratified in places, and at the\r\nouter edge was brittle. It did not break into the long narrow prisms\r\nof the ice at Saint-Georges and the Pré de Saint-Livres, but rather\r\ninto small lumps with facets, of all sorts of shapes. It was evidently\r\nunsafe to penetrate under the ice roof, for while I stood in front of\r\nthe cave, a large lump broke off from the roof and fell with a clatter\r\namong a lot of other ice fragments already on the moraine floor. In two\r\nplaces there was a steady rain of drops from the roof, showing that the\r\nice was melting.\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps the glacier cave in Switzerland which is easiest to\r\nvisit, and my inspection intensified my belief in what I consider\r\nthe correct explanation of some of the phenomena in glacières. The\r\nsuggestion was that as soon as the temperature gets above freezing\r\npoint in a glacier ice cave, the only process is that of destruction of\r\nthe ice, which seems to be also the case with glacières.\r\n\r\n\r\nLA GRAND CAVE DE MONTARQUIS.\r\n\r\nMy brother and I left Cluses, in Savoie, a railroad station on the line\r\nbetween Geneva and Chamonix, at two o'clock on the afternoon of the\r\n22d of August, 1897, and drove up in two hours and a half to Pralong\r\ndu Reposoir, a distance of eleven kilometers. The road is a _route\r\nnationale_, fine and broad, with parapets in many places. After passing\r\nScionzier, it mounts gradually, passing through a tremendous wild\r\ngorge, cut by the waters and heavily clad with firs. We reached Pralong\r\nat four-thirty, and stopped at a primitive inn, still in process of\r\nconstruction, and tenanted only by blue-bloused peasants, who, as it\r\nwas Sunday night, sat up late, drinking and making a heathenish noise\r\nthey mistook for singing. I talked to some of these men, and they all\r\ninsisted that there was no ice at the Grand Cave in winter, but that\r\nit came in summer. _Plus il fait chaud, plus ça gêle_, they said. One\r\nman explained the formation of the ice in an original way, and with\r\nan intelligence far above that of the average peasant. He considered\r\nthat it was due to air currents, and thought that in winter the snow\r\nstopped up the holes in the rocks, through which the currents came; but\r\nthat when the snow melted, the draughts could work, and that then they\r\nformed the ice.\r\n\r\nThe weather was abominable next morning, the clouds lying along and\r\ndripping into the valley; but the inn was so awful that we decided to\r\ntry to reach the cave. We had a nice little blue-bloused peasant for\r\na guide, Sylvain Jean Cotterlaz by name. We went first for about an\r\nhour on foot towards Le Grand Bornant on a fair road, to an alp called\r\nLa Salle. This was surrounded by a herd of cows, some of whom seemed\r\ninterested in our party. It now began to rain fiercely, and except for\r\nmy brother's perseverance, I should certainly have given in. A fair\r\npath led up steep grass slopes into the clouds covering the Mont Bargy.\r\nEach of us had his umbrella raised, and the ascent was slippery and\r\nuninspiring. An hour took us to two deserted huts, the Alpe Montarquis,\r\nand half an hour beyond, we came to the caves; by which time we were\r\nthoroughly soaked.\r\n\r\nThe caves are on Mont Bargy, at the base of a limestone precipice,\r\nwhich, I think, faces nearly north. There are three caves close\r\ntogether. The lowest, or Petite Cave de Montarquis, Cotterlaz said is\r\nalso called La Cave des Faux-Monayeurs; as according to a, probably\r\nuntrue, tradition, it was once used by counterfeiters. Above this is a\r\nsmall rock pocket, accessible down an easy slope. We went in and found\r\nthat there was no ice and indeed scarcely any water in it.\r\n\r\nThe Grand--not Grande--Cave is a little higher up, and as we came\r\nto it, several sheep, which had taken refuge in the mouth from the\r\nstorm, hastily skipped away, evidently distrusting our intentions. The\r\naltitude of the cave is said to be 2078 meters. The entrance must face\r\nabout north east; it is elliptical in shape, about fifteen meters wide,\r\nand six meters high, and is badly sheltered against the wind. The cave\r\nis of moderate size, about sixty meters in length and forty-five meters\r\nin width, and the average height of the roof is not over four or five\r\nmeters. A gentle slope leads downwards. Many blocks of rock in the\r\nfront part had bits of moss growing on them, and some of the mud there\r\nwas of a dull purple color, as if some dark madder was mixed with it.\r\nThere was a red streak in the right hand wall, probably caused by iron.\r\nI observed no limestone stalactites nor stalagmites in the cave, the\r\nmain body of which was well lighted throughout by daylight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8. Vertical Section of Grand Cave de Montarquis.]\r\n\r\nThe ice was in the shape of a nearly level floor, about twelve meters\r\nlong and eight meters wide: the shape was irregular, and the ice so\r\nsmooth that it was hard to stand up. The rocks in the rear overhung the\r\nice floor at one spot; and here, there streamed from a fissure to the\r\nice floor an ice column, some three meters high, whose base was fully\r\ntwo meters distant from the rock wall. Near this column was a tiny ice\r\ncone, which evidently had been bigger. Cotterlaz seemed impressed with\r\nthe fact that there was only one column in the cave, as he said that\r\nin June, there would have been many columns and a larger and deeper\r\nice floor. The ice was sloppy in places, with several small hollows\r\ncut by the drip and containing water. In one place there was a tiny\r\nrunnel filled with water, but there was no current. There was a good\r\ndeal of drip all through the cave, and in fact in one or two places we\r\nmight have kept on holding up our umbrellas with advantage. I hacked at\r\nseveral pieces of ice, but none of it was prismatic.\r\n\r\nAt the rear of the cave, the ice ran, in a tongue, up the entrance of\r\nan ascending fissure in the rocks. My brother cut here six or seven\r\nsteps in the ice; and he found them difficult to make, as the ice was\r\nhard and thin, and not in a melting state. Above the ice tongue we\r\nclambered up the rocks of the fissure some four or five meters further,\r\nfinding there some lumps of ice which were not melting. At this spot we\r\nwere almost in darkness. A lighted match burned steadily, so that there\r\nwas evidently not much draught, but the smoke gradually descended,\r\nshowing a slight downward current. This was the coldest, as well as the\r\nfurthest point of the cave we could reach, and we there heard a tiny\r\nwaterfall trickling within the fissure, although we could not see it.\r\n\r\nBy this time we were all chilled to the bone, so, abandoning the\r\nidea of entering the Petite Cave, we retreated down the sopping wet,\r\nslippery grass slopes to Pralong, and then immediately walked all\r\nthe way to Cluses to avoid taking cold. The Grand Cave was the most\r\nfatiguing trip I ever made after glacières, but the circumstances were\r\nrather unusual.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FREEZING WELL OF OWEGO.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, June 23d, 1898, I went to Owego, in Tioga County, New\r\nYork. Inquiries at the Lehigh Valley railroad station and at the chief\r\nhotel failed to elicit any information about a freezing well; and in\r\nfact, I soon found that the existence of such a thing was a blank to\r\nthe rising generation. So I called on an old resident of Owego, who\r\ntold me that he knew of the well in question and that it was filled up\r\nwith stones many years ago; but that he remembered that, when he was a\r\nboy, it used to freeze, and that it was spoken of as the deep well or\r\nfreezing well. I then walked up to the site of the well, which is about\r\none and a half kilometers to the northwest from the centre of Owego and\r\nabout one kilometer from the Susquehanna River. It is directly in the\r\nmiddle of the highway, and nothing is now visible but a heap of stones.\r\n\r\nNear by was the house of a Mr. Preston, who told me he was born in\r\n1816, and had lived all his life at this spot. He said that the well\r\nwas about twenty-eight meters deep, and that it went first through\r\na layer of sand and then through a layer of gravel. He had more than\r\nonce been down the well and had seen the sides covered with ice. A\r\nbucket sent down for water would sometimes come up with ice on the\r\nsides. Whether the water at the bottom ever froze, no one knew, for\r\nthe ice caked and filled up the bore at about two-thirds of the way\r\ndown and became so thick, that as Mr. Preston put it, \"it was just like\r\nhammering on an anvil to try to break it.\" He also stated that another\r\nwell was dug about one hundred meters further down the road, and that\r\noriginally this sometimes had a little ice on the sides. Of late years\r\nhowever, it was covered over with a wooden top and since then no ice\r\nwas known to form. I could obtain no information about any other wells\r\nin the neighborhood ever showing similar peculiarities.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ICY GLEN, NEAR STOCKBRIDGE.\r\n\r\nThe Icy Glen is situated on Bear Mountain, about one kilometer from\r\nStockbridge, Massachusetts. It is in the midst of fine woods and there\r\nare many big trees in it. The bottom of the glen is full of rocks\r\nand boulders, among which there is a rough path. I was told that ice\r\nremained over there much longer than anywhere else in the neighborhood,\r\nsometimes as late as May. On the 3d of July, 1898, I not only found no\r\ntraces of ice or snow, but the temperatures under the boulders showed\r\nnothing abnormal. To make up for this, however, there were legions of\r\nmosquitoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEZING MARBLE CAVE, NEAR MANCHESTER.\r\n\r\nNear Manchester, Vermont, there is a little cave,[6] which is\r\nnoteworthy, in that it is in a marble formation. It is known as\r\nSkinner's Cave, because it was owned for many years by Mr. Mark\r\nSkinner. It lies in Skinner's Hollow, some five or six kilometers from\r\nthe centre of Manchester, at the base of the eastern slope of Mount\r\nEquinox, of the Taghconic Range of the Green Mountains.\r\n\r\n[6] My attention was called to this cave, by Messrs. John Ritchie, Jr.,\r\nof Boston, and Byerly Hart of Philadelphia, who visited it some years\r\nago. Mr. Ritchie's opinion is that it is simply a refrigerator.\r\n\r\nThe cave is on the property of Mr. N. M. Canfield, who, on learning the\r\nobject of my visit, on the 5th of July, 1898, with true native American\r\ncourtesy, walked up to it with me. The last two kilometers were over a\r\nrough logging road, which towards the end was steep and covered with\r\nmany broken logs. I could not have found the cave alone, as it was\r\nso surrounded with bushes, that the entrance was invisible until we\r\nactually reached it. It is in a gorge of Mount Equinox, in the midst\r\nof a beautiful forest, which effectually cuts off any wind. The cave\r\nfaces nearly north and can scarcely ever, if indeed at any time, be\r\nreached by the rays of the sun. The moment we got into the entrance, we\r\nfound the chilly, damp, summer atmosphere of true glacière caves. The\r\nrocks were brown and mossy on the outside, but Mr. Canfield called my\r\nattention to the fact that they were marble, and on his knocking off\r\na small piece, a section of pure white marble was exposed. In no other\r\ninstance have I heard of a marble cave in connection with ice. There\r\nwere scarcely any cracks or crevices in the rock.\r\n\r\nThe cave goes down with a steep slope from the entrance, much in the\r\nshape of a tunnel, for some ten meters. The slope was covered with\r\nslippery mud and decayed leaves, and at the bottom expanded into a\r\nlittle chamber, in which lay a mass of wet, compact snow, some two by\r\nthree meters. It was evident that the snow was simply drifted in during\r\nthe winter, and was in too large a mass and too well protected to melt\r\neasily, and there could be no question but that this place was purely\r\na refrigerator. The air was tranquil throughout and there were no\r\ndraughts. On the same day, a good breeze was blowing in the Manchester\r\nValley.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FREEZING WELL OF BRANDON.\r\n\r\nThe Freezing Well of Brandon is situated on the western or southwestern\r\noutskirts of the village of Brandon, Vermont, not far from the railroad\r\nstation. I visited it on the 7th of July, 1898. The well was protected\r\nby a wooden cover. On raising this, a faint stream of cool air seemed\r\nto issue forth; but this was probably only imagination. The sides, as\r\nfar down as one could see, were built in with rather large blocks of\r\nstone without cement. At the bottom water was visible and there were\r\nno signs of ice. We drew up some water in a bucket, and although it\r\nwas cool there was nothing icy about it. I twice lowered a thermometer\r\nnearly to the water and each time after ten minutes it registered only\r\n13° C. There was certainly nothing abnormal in this temperature, in\r\nfact it was strictly normal and my thermometer showed conclusively by\r\nits actions that it could not have been near any ice mass. The people\r\nat the house, however, assured me that a month before there was ice in\r\nthe well.\r\n\r\nAfterwards I called on Mr. C. O. Luce, the owner of the well. He stated\r\nthat it was eleven and a half meters deep to the bottom, that it was\r\ndug in 1858, and that the ground through which it goes was found frozen\r\nat a depth of about four and a half meters. Here there is a stratum of\r\ngravel and this is where the freezing occurs. Mr. Luce thought that\r\nthe water was under the ice, that is, that the water came up from the\r\nbottom. He said also that the well usually froze solid in winter; but,\r\nthat as this winter was an open one, there was less ice this year than\r\nusual. He thought that there was less ice anyway now than in former\r\nyears, partly because of the cover which was put over the well, and\r\nwhich keeps out some of the cold; and partly because a neighboring\r\ngravel hillock, called the Hogback, was a good deal cut away, and this\r\nin some way affects the supply of cold in the gravel. He added that the\r\nsandy soil round Brandon does not as a rule freeze to a greater depth\r\nthan two meters each winter. The house built beside the well was said\r\nto be comfortable in winter.\r\n\r\nThere seems no doubt that this is another refrigerator. The cold water\r\nof the winter snows percolates into the gravel mass and refreezes, and,\r\nowing to the bad conductive quality of the material, the gravel remains\r\nfrozen later than the soil elsewhere in the neighborhood. The fact that\r\nthe well went through a frozen gravel stratum when dug, proves that it\r\nis not alone the air that sinks into the well itself, which makes the\r\nice. The fact that the well freezes on the whole less than formerly,\r\napparently partly owing to the digging up of some of the gravel close\r\nby, goes to prove the same thing. The fact that the well generally\r\nfreezes solid every winter, shows that although some of the gravel\r\nmass possibly remains frozen all the time, much of the ice is renewed\r\neach year. This is especially important as proving that the ice found\r\nin gravel deposits is due to the cold of winter and not to a glacial\r\nperiod, although, of course, no one could say for how long a time the\r\nice was forming and melting; and this process might date back to the\r\ntime of the formation of the gravel mass.\r\n\r\nI could learn nothing of any similar place near Brandon, except that\r\nMr. Luce said that in an old abandoned silver mine in the neighborhood,\r\nhe had once seen ice during hot weather.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEZING TALUS ON LOWER AUSABLE POND.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side of Lower Ausable Pond, Essex County, New York,\r\nat the foot of Mount Sébille or Colvin, there is a talus of great\r\nLaurentian boulders, which fell from the mountain and lie piled up\r\non the edge of the lake. Among these boulders, at a distance of\r\nabout five hundred meters from the southern end of the lake, there\r\nare spaces, several of which might be called caves, although they are\r\nreally hollows between the boulders. On the 12th of July, 1898, I\r\nvisited this spot with Mr. Edward I. H. Howell of Philadelphia. From\r\nseveral of the rock cracks we found a draught of air flowing strongly\r\nout, as tested by the smoke of a cigar. The air was distinctly icy and\r\nthere could be no question that there was a considerable quantity of\r\nice among the rocks to produce the temperature.\r\n\r\nIn three places we found masses of ice. One of these hollows was small,\r\nand the other two were much larger. One of the latter was almost round\r\nin shape, and perhaps three meters in diameter; with a little snow near\r\nthe mouth and with plenty of ice at the bottom. The other was a long\r\ndescending crack between two boulders which joined overhead, and with\r\nthe bottom filled by a long, narrow slope of ice, perhaps seventy-five\r\ncentimeters in width and six meters in length, set at an angle of about\r\nthirty-five degrees. The ice was hard and non-prismatic.\r\n\r\nThe cold air affects a large area of land around the boulders. Mr.\r\nHowell called my attention to the flowers of the bunch-berry, which he\r\nsaid were at least two weeks behind those on the surrounding mountains.\r\nThe same was true of _oxalis_, a pretty white flower, of which we found\r\nseveral beds in full bloom.\r\n\r\nMr. Howell went to this talus, on the 4th of July previous, with Mr.\r\nNiles, President of the Appalachian Mountain Club, on which occasion\r\nthey found plenty of snow near the entrance of the larger hollow. Mr.\r\nHowell, indeed, has repeatedly visited this place, and always found\r\nice, which must, therefore, be looked on as perennial. At all times\r\nalso he has felt cold draughts flowing out; sometimes they were so\r\nstrong as to lower the temperature over the lake to a distance of\r\nthirty meters or more: on hot days he has seen occasionally a misty\r\ncloud form on the lake in front of the boulders. Mr. Howell considers\r\nthat the draughts so affect the surrounding air, that an artificial\r\nclimate is produced, and it is owing to this that spring flowers bloom\r\nlate in July and sometimes in August. Another fact well known to him,\r\nis that in hot weather, the spot in front of the boulders is the best\r\nin the whole lake to catch trout, as they always congregate in the\r\ncoldest water. The Adirondack guides use these ice retaining hollows,\r\nwhich they call ice-caves, as refrigerators for their provisions and\r\ngame in hot weather: they say that the ice is formed in winter and\r\nremains over during the summer, as it is so well sheltered.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEZING TALUS OF THE GIANT OF THE VALLEY.\r\n\r\nOn the indications of Mr. Otis, chief guide of the Adirondack Reserve,\r\nI explored with Mr. C. Lamb, a guide from Keene Valley, the southern\r\nbase of the Giant of the Valley Mountain, Essex County, New York, on\r\nthe 14th of July, 1898. A road runs from Keene Heights to Port Henry,\r\nthrough the gap between the south base of the Giant of the Valley and\r\nthe north base of Round Mountain, and passes close to a small lake\r\ncalled Chapel Pond. Some three hundred meters west of this lake, we\r\nleft the road and struck north, across the brook, into the thick, mossy\r\nwoods. After perhaps one hundred meters, we came to a talus of great\r\nboulders of Laurentian rock, with the cliffs of the Giant, whence the\r\nboulders had fallen, rising steeply above. We found ice under several\r\nof them, although never in any quantity. The thermometer, after an\r\nexposure of fifteen minutes in one of these little hollows, registered\r\n6° C., although not more than one meter from where the sunshine fell on\r\nthe moss. In the shade of a tree one meter distant from the same hollow\r\nit registered 26° C.; a difference of 20° C. at a distance of only two\r\nmeters.\r\n\r\nPerhaps one kilometer east of Chapel Pond, there is a place, where the\r\nbases of the mountains come much nearer together, which bears the name\r\nof \"The Narrows.\" Here we crossed the brook again, and, after some\r\nfifteen or twenty meters of scrambling through rough woods, reached\r\nonce more the talus of the Giant, composed of tremendous boulders.\r\nAmong these we found ice in many places and this time in large\r\nquantities. Within one boulder cave we found an ice slab some four\r\nmeters in length, by two meters in width, and one meter in thickness.\r\nThis was pure, hard and non-prismatic ice, and was evidently not formed\r\nof compressed snow: in fact snow could not have drifted in under the\r\nboulder. We broke off a large piece of ice and took it back to Saint\r\nHubert's Inn, and it melted rather slowly. From the mouth of this cave\r\nan icy draught issued, and, as it struck the warmer air outside, a\r\nslight mist was formed. Mr. Lamb said that from the road itself he had\r\nsometimes seen mist rising from this talus. Further explorations of the\r\ntalus of the Giant would probably reveal ice in many other places than\r\nthose we examined.[7]\r\n\r\n[7] Mr. E. I. H. Howell examined several times, in 1899, the talus of\r\nthe Giant of the Valley. He found ice in many places; also cold air\r\ncurrents blowing out. At one spot, there is a spring which flows all\r\nthrough the summer, and the water is so cold, that its temperature is\r\nlittle above that of melting ice. Mr. Howell found, as at Ausable Pond,\r\nspring flowers growing in mid-summer among the rocks of the talus.\r\n\r\nMr. Lamb told me of two other places in the Adirondacks, where he\r\nfound ice in similar boulder formations. One was in the talus of Mount\r\nWallface in Indian Pass, between Mounts Wallface and McIntyre. The\r\nother was in the talus of Mount McIntyre in Avalanche Pass, between\r\nMounts McIntyre and Colden. At the latter place, he found it near the\r\ntrail going round the lake in the pass.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ICE GULCH, RANDOLPH.\r\n\r\nThe Randolph Ice Gulch is situated in Randolph Township, New Hampshire,\r\nabout eight kilometers from Randolph Station, on the Boston and Maine\r\nRailroad.[8] I visited it on August 11th, 1898. At the Mount Crescent\r\nHouse, I found a guide in the person of Mr. Charles E. Lowe, Jr. The\r\nexcursion took us about six hours. The trail was a rough bush path,\r\ncut by the Appalachian Mountain Club, and which had not been cleaned\r\nout that year. It was a cloudy but hot day and this, combined with the\r\nbadness of the road, made the walk fatiguing.\r\n\r\n[8] I first heard of the Ice Gulch from Mr. John Ritchie, Jr., of\r\nBoston. Some years ago in the middle of July, he found ice plentiful in\r\nthe second chamber. He thought the Gulch only a refrigerator.\r\n\r\nThe Gulch lies between Crescent and Black Mountains. The altitude of\r\nthe upper end of the Gulch is something over eight hundred meters,\r\nthat of the lower end about six hundred meters. It is some fifteen\r\nhundred meters long, and averages perhaps one hundred meters in width\r\nat the top, and only a few meters at the bottom. The depth may be about\r\nseventy-five meters and the sides are steep, in some places sheer.\r\nThe bottom is a mass of broken, fallen rocks, with a good many trees\r\ngrowing among them. There are several steps, so to speak, in the Gulch,\r\nwhich are called chambers, although the term seems rather meaningless.\r\nPromenading through the bottom of the Gulch was fraught with\r\ndifficulty, because the rocks were placed in most unsuitable positions\r\nfor human progression, and my hands were certainly as useful to me as\r\nmy feet in preserving equilibrium. We found ice in one or two places,\r\nbut not in any great quantity. In one spot it was overlaid by water. My\r\nguide said that there was less ice than the year before. A large piece\r\nwhich we broke off, and which furnished us with a cooling morsel of\r\nfrozen fluid, was full of air bubbles. It was not prismatic ice, and\r\nwas certainly unusual in formation. It crunched up under the teeth and,\r\nalthough it did not look like solidified snow, yet, judging from its\r\nposition among the boulders, it was doubtless formed from the melting\r\nand refreezing of snow.[9] My guide said he had heard that fresh ice\r\nbegan to form sometimes in September. The Gulch is well protected\r\nagainst wind, and I detected no draughts among the rocks. Except in the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the ice, the temperature was not abnormally low.\r\n\r\n[9] On the 17th of February, 1899, four days after the greatest snow\r\nstorm in Philadelphia in many years, I noticed that the snow on my\r\nroof solidified slowly into a mass of ice which contained a good\r\nmany air-bubbles. It strikingly resembled the ice of the Ice Gulch,\r\nonly that it was more solid and did not have more than half as many\r\nair-bubbles.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the Mount Crescent House, I had a talk with Mr. Charles\r\nE. Lowe, Sr., who told me that Alpine plants, like those which grow on\r\nMount Washington and Mount Adams, are found in the Gulch; but that they\r\ndo not exist on the neighboring Black and Crescent Mountains. He said\r\nalso that ice was present in more than one place in King's Ravine, and\r\nthat it was always there.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEZING BOULDER TALUS AT RUMNEY.\r\n\r\nAbout three kilometers south of Rumney, New Hampshire, there is a hill\r\ncalled Bald Mountain, which, about three hundred meters west of the\r\ncarriage road from Rumney to Plymouth, descends as a big cliff, with\r\nan exposure facing nearly southeast. At the base of this cliff, there\r\nis a talus[10] which I visited on the 27th of August, 1898, with the\r\nSheriff of Rumney, Mr. Learned. He said he had found plenty of ice\r\nthere on the 18th of August, 1897, but he doubted whether there would\r\nbe any left this year, on account of the hot weather. Effectively a\r\ncareful hunt failed to reveal any ice, although the talus was just\r\nthe kind of place where it might have been expected, as the boulders\r\nwere piled one over the other and in one or two places there were\r\nconsiderable hollows. The temperatures were normal, and there were\r\nno draughts. The talus is exposed to the sun, and only moderately\r\nsheltered against wind by a scrub forest. But there can be no doubt,\r\nthat ice lingers there long after it has disappeared from every other\r\nspot in the neighborhood, and it seems as if our not finding any, is\r\nanother proof that it is the heat of summer which melts it away.\r\n\r\n[10] Mr. John Ritchie, Jr., wrote me about this place, where he had\r\nfound ice plentiful some years ago in August, within two or three\r\nmeters from the outside: he considered it only a refrigerator.\r\n\r\n\r\nICE FORMATIONS AND WINDHOLES AT WATERTOWN.\r\n\r\nAt Watertown, New York, on the south side of the Black River, in the\r\ntown itself, are some natural cracks or crevices in the limestone\r\nrocks. They are only a short distance from the New York Central\r\nRailroad station. The cracks enter the northern side of the railroad\r\nembankment, pass under the railroad tracks, and extend some distance\r\nback. In front of them are four cellars, used for storing beer kegs.\r\nThe lessor, Mr. Ehrlicher, obligingly had the cellars opened for me, on\r\nthe 12th of September, 1898. There was neither ice nor draughts in the\r\ncellars, and the temperature was normal. Mr. Ehrlicher said that in the\r\nspring there was ice in the cracks, but that it had all melted away as\r\nthe result of the hot summer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BLUFF AT DECORAH.\r\n\r\n  From a Photograph by Mr. A. F. Kovarik.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAbout four kilometers west of Watertown, on the south bank of the Black\r\nRiver, is the picnic ground of Glen Park, which is reached by trolley.\r\nThe manager of the restaurant walked around the park with me. In one\r\nspot is a hollow or glen at the base of a small, much cracked limestone\r\ncliff, which has a northern exposure. The manager said that snow and\r\nice usually lies in this place until June, not only among the broken\r\nrocks, but even in the open. Sometimes ice remains among the boulders\r\nall summer, but only near the front of the boulders, and by pushing\r\nin, one soon gets beyond it: we found none, a fact showing once more\r\nthe effect of the unusually warm summer. On hot days, draughts issue\r\nfrom between the boulders, but as the day was cool, we did not notice\r\nany. The spot is well sheltered against the wind by a number of trees;\r\nand the shape of the hollow reminded me of the glen in front of the\r\nEishöhle bei Roth.\r\n\r\nNot one hundred meters from this hollow, is a little limestone cave,\r\nclosed by a wooden door, which excludes any cold air in winter.\r\nThe cave is lighted by electric lights, and is a narrow, crooked,\r\ndescending fissure, a _ganghöhle_, where the marks of water action are\r\nplainly visible. At the bottom a little stream, evidently the active\r\nagent in forming the cave, ran through the fissured limestone. In the\r\nstream a large toad or frog was swimming about. There was nothing icy\r\nabout the cave or the water, and the temperature was normal. Ice was\r\nnever known to form in the cave. These two places, so close together,\r\nare an interesting confirmation that it is only where the outside cold\r\ncan get in, that we find subterranean ice.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FREEZING CAVE AND FREEZING WELLS OF DECORAH.\r\n\r\nNear Decorah, Iowa, is a freezing cavern, which is more frequently\r\nreferred to in cave literature than is generally the case. I visited it\r\non Friday, September the 30th, 1898, with an old English resident of\r\nDecorah, Mr. W. D. Selby-Hill. The cave is situated about one kilometer\r\nto the northward of Decorah, on the north bank of the Upper Iowa River,\r\nat the base of a bluff. It is some thirty to forty meters above the\r\nstream, and faces southward. It looks like a fault or fissure in the\r\nrocks, with the sides meeting a few meters overhead. It is a true\r\ncave, but probably in an early stage of formation, for there are no\r\napparent traces of water action, nor any stalagmites nor stalactites.\r\nThe absence of the latter may, however, be due to the fact that it is a\r\nperiodic glacière. The rock is a white limestone, rich in fossils. The\r\ncave is some two to three meters in width and is rather winding, with a\r\nshort arm or pocket branching out on the west side. The main cave runs\r\nback some thirty meters from the entrance. In one place it is necessary\r\nto stoop, to get past some overhanging rock slabs. By candle light, we\r\nwent to the rear of the cave, and found it warm, dry, and free from\r\nice. There were no draughts, possibly because the day was cool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ENTRANCE OF THE CAVE OF DECORAH.\r\n\r\n  From a Photograph by Mr. A. F. Kovarik.\r\n]\r\n\r\nI looked in vain for _tubular fissures_, or indeed any fissures,\r\nthrough which _water might freeze by pressure in its descent_, as the\r\nbelievers in the capillary theory say it does. Nothing of the kind\r\nexisted, and I wrote in my note-book: \"Writing on the very spot about\r\nwhich this theory was started, I feel justified in asserting that the\r\ntheory amounts to absolutely nothing and is entirely incorrect.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Hill told me that there were two wells in the southern portion of\r\nDecorah Township, where ice was found in summer. I visited them both,\r\nbut found no ice, and the temperatures normal. Mr. Hill said that one\r\nof the wells was dug about thirty years ago, and that the workman told\r\nhim that the ground which he went through was frozen; and that at one\r\nplace he struck an opening, from which came so strong a current of icy\r\nair, that it was hard to keep at work.\r\n\r\nI talked to several persons afterwards. _Inter alia_, they told me that\r\nthe bluff was a great place for rattlesnakes, sometimes big ones. They\r\nadmitted also generally that they were puzzled about the formation of\r\nice in the cave. Some claimed that the ice formed in summer--the old\r\nstory once more. I met, however, Mr. Alois F. Kovarik of the Decorah\r\nInstitute, who had made a series of regular observations for over a\r\nyear and found that the ice begins to form about the end of March and\r\nbeginning of April, and is at its maximum towards the beginning of\r\nJune. Mr. Kovarik also told me, that he had found ice in one of the\r\nwells in the beginning of August.\r\n\r\nThis was an especially satisfactory trip to me, for it did away, once\r\nfor all, with any possible belief that there was any basis of fact for\r\nthe capillary theory. It also seems to me important to find that the\r\nice of these freezing wells melts in summer. For it shows that their\r\nice is due to the same causes as those which form the ice in the cave,\r\nand is another proof against the validity of the glacial period theory.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEZING ROCK TALUS ON SPRUCE CREEK.\r\n\r\nOn Spruce Creek, Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania, about four kilometers\r\nnorth of the Pennsylvania Railroad depot, is an ice bearing talus,\r\nknown locally as the Ice Holes or Ice Caves. I visited this spot, on\r\nOctober the 5th, 1898, with Mr. Benner, of Spruce Creek. We walked\r\nup the pretty valley along the old Pittsburgh turnpike, at one place\r\nfinding some papaw trees, whose fruit had a horrible sickening taste;\r\nthen we crossed Spruce Creek by a footbridge and followed the other\r\nbank back for some five hundred meters, until we were nearly opposite\r\nthe old Colerain Forge, which is located in a piece of land called by\r\nthe curious name of Africa. About half way from the bridge we smelt\r\na strange odor, which my companion thought came from a copperhead or\r\nrattlesnake: we did not investigate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOCUS GLACIALIS--CAVE OF DECORAH.\r\n\r\n  From a Photograph by Mr. A. F. Kovarik.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe freezing talus is situated at the foot of Tussey Mountain: it is\r\nbig, and is composed of small sandstone (?) rock débris. The talus is\r\nat least thirty meters high and one hundred and twenty meters long.\r\nAs I stood at the bottom, I was reminded strongly of the talus at the\r\nDornburg. At the base were a number of small pits, evidently dug by\r\nman. From the interstices between the rocks, icy cold draughts issued\r\nin some places, and there was no doubt that there was plenty of ice\r\nbeneath the stones. In one place we thought we could see ice, and I\r\npoked at the white substance with my stick, but I am not positive\r\nthat it was ice. All over the talus, the temperature was strikingly\r\ncolder than a few meters away, and in the pits we could see our breaths\r\ndistinctly. Although I am not much of a botanist, yet it seemed to me\r\nthat the flora immediately near the talus was somewhat different in\r\ncharacter from that of the surrounding country.\r\n\r\nMr. Benner told me that he saw, three or four weeks before, plenty of\r\nice in the pits; that they were made by farmers who formerly came to\r\nthis spot to get ice; and that parties occasionally picnic here in the\r\nsummer and make ice cream. He stated also that he saw, some years ago,\r\na small cave or hole containing ice near Mapleton, Pennsylvania, but\r\nthat it was destroyed by quarrying the rock away.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEZING GORGE NEAR ELLENVILLE.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, October the 9th, 1898, with a young man from Ellenville,\r\nI visited the well known Ellenville Gorge, in the Shawangunk Range,\r\nUlster County, New York. We left the hotel at eight-forty A. M. and\r\nreached the gorge, known locally as the Ice Cave, at ten-five A. M.\r\nIt is about four kilometers northeast from Ellenville. The path rises\r\nsteadily uphill and is of the roughest description; it is covered with\r\nloose stones, and looks as if it might become the bed of a mountain\r\nbrook in wet weather.\r\n\r\nI call this place a gorge, instead of a cave, because it is uncovered\r\nat the top, but probably originally it was covered. It is shaped like\r\na pit cave minus a roof, and it reminded me of the Friedrichsteiner\r\nEishöhle, and the Glacières de Saint-Georges and du Pré de\r\nSaint-Livres. It is entered by a long slope from the western end, the\r\ngorge turning northward further back. I estimated its width, at the\r\nbottom at some five to seven meters, at the top at some three to four\r\nmeters; its length at some thirty meters and the deepest point we\r\nreached, at some twenty meters below the surface. These are guesses,\r\nhowever. In one place, a great rock slab overhangs the gorge. At nearly\r\nthe lowest point of the rock floor, there is a hole which extends\r\nperpendicularly downwards some five or ten meters more; this opening\r\nis partly blocked up with fallen masses of rock which would make a\r\nfurther descent perilous. The north end of the gorge is also filled up\r\nwith a mass of great broken rocks; in fact, the whole place is out of\r\nrepair, as the rocks are cracked and creviced on both sides to a great\r\nextent. The rock is friable and seems to be all breaking up, or rather\r\ndown, and I think there is some danger from falling stones, although\r\nI did not see any fall. There is a good deal of moss on the sides of\r\nthe gorge, and on some ledges small evergreens are growing. The gorge\r\nis sheltered thoroughly from winds by its formation and position, and\r\nsomewhat by the scrub forest surrounding it. There are several long,\r\ndeep crevices a few meters further up the mountain side, and I think\r\none of them is an extension of the main gorge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GORGE AT ELLENVILLE.\r\n\r\n  From a Photograph by Mr. Davis.\r\n]\r\n\r\nWe found no ice. It generally lasts till about the beginning of\r\nSeptember; and Professor Angelo Heilprin, and Miss Julia L. Lewis, of\r\nPhiladelphia, have found plenty of it in July and August. But the ice\r\nhad evidently now been gone for some time, for the temperature at the\r\nbottom of the gorge was about 11° C. at ten-thirty A. M. This was but\r\nlittle colder than the temperature v outside, which at ten-fifteen A.\r\nM. was 14° C.\r\n\r\nOn returning to Ellenville, I learnt that there was another somewhat\r\nsimilar smaller gorge, some eight kilometers away, at a place called\r\nSam's Point. This, however, is said to retain only snow, while in the\r\nEllenville gorge much ice is sometimes formed, and icicles a couple of\r\nmeters long are said to hang on the sides of the cliffs. The proprietor\r\nof the hotel told me he had heard of a cave which contained ice not far\r\nfrom Albany, at a place called Carlisle, on the Delaware and Hudson\r\nRailroad.\r\n\r\n\r\nFREEZING CAVE AND WINDHOLES NEAR FARRANDSVILLE.\r\n\r\nI arrived at Farrandsville, Clinton County, Pennsylvania, early on\r\nTuesday morning, October the 11th, 1898, and found a boy, who worked\r\nin a brick mill, as guide to the caves.[11] After emptying a small,\r\nflat bottomed boat of the water of which it was half full, we rowed\r\nacross the Susquehanna River; then we walked up the road, along the\r\nriver bank, for a couple of hundred meters, and struck up the so-called\r\npath to the caves. Although the whole of the mountain side was at the\r\ndisposal of the road maker, no better plan seems to have suggested\r\nitself than to make the track go straight up. This saved making\r\nzigzags, yet the result is that the path is steep, and as it is rocky\r\nand slippery, it is hard travelling without bootnails or alpenstock.\r\n\r\n[11] I learned of this cave from Mr. Eugene F. McCabe, of Renovo,\r\nPennsylvania. Mr. McCabe took out large pieces of ice from it in the\r\nmonth of August. On December 23d, 1896, he found no ice inside the\r\ncave, but a hoar frost covered the rocks; the temperature outside\r\nwas -5.6°; inside -4.5°: the day was clear and there was no breeze;\r\nseveral matches lighted in the cave were almost instantly blown out by\r\na current of air coming from crevices in the rocks.\r\n\r\nMr. Ira C. Chatham, postmaster at Farrandsville, wrote to me on the\r\n19th of October, 1898, as follows: \"Your paper on Ice Caves [Journal\r\nof the Franklin Institute, March, 1897] at pp. 177 and 178 describes\r\nthe Farrandsville Cave as near as is possible, as the ice forms in the\r\nspring from the snow melting and dropping through the rocks into the\r\ncave, and the rocks face directly north as stated.\"\r\n\r\nAs we went up, I noticed, in one or two places, cold draughts issuing\r\nfrom crevices in the rocks. We soon came to a hollow under a rock,\r\nwhere there were a number of cracks and crevices: the boy spoke of it\r\nas the lower cave. It is some sixty meters above the Susquehanna River\r\nand cold draughts flowed from the cracks, although we saw no ice. The\r\ncave was about twenty meters higher up. One could crawl into it for\r\na couple of meters, and all round it the rocks are somewhat creviced;\r\nin fact, I think there are a good many cracks in the entire hill.\r\nThere was no ice in sight in this hole, but a strong, cold draught\r\npoured from it. After an exposure of fifteen minutes the thermometer\r\nregistered 6° C.; while outside, in the shade, it stood at 15° C. This\r\ndecidedly sub-normal temperature proved unmistakably, in my opinion,\r\nthe presence of ice a little further than we could see in. Both holes\r\nface about north and are sheltered, by their position and by the sparse\r\nforest which covers the ridge, against all winds except those from the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nI talked to the postmaster and the railroad agent at Farrandsville\r\non my return, and they stated that there was no ice in the hole in\r\nwinter, but that it formed about April and remained over until towards\r\nSeptember, showing that the cave is a normal glacière on a small scale.\r\n\r\n\r\nGLACIÈRES NEAR SUMMIT.\r\n\r\nIn the search for coal, the mountains of the Appalachian Chain between\r\nthe little town of Summit, and the neighboring village of Coaldale,\r\nCarbon County, Pennsylvania, were mined and tunneled in every\r\ndirection. Owing to the caving in of some of these mines, depressions\r\nformed in certain places along the ridge in the upper surface of the\r\nground, and in two of these hollows natural refrigerators occur. These\r\nwere brought to my notice by Mr. C. J. Nicholson of Philadelphia, and I\r\nvisited them on May the 5th, 1899, in company with two coal miners of\r\nSummit.\r\n\r\nStarting from Summit, we passed across some rough ground under which\r\nthere was a mine on fire; and the miners showed me the tops of two\r\npipes sticking out of the ground, from which issued a smoke or steam,\r\ntoo hot to hold the hand in more than a few seconds. Going beyond\r\nthrough brushwood, for a couple of hundred meters, we came to the\r\nfirst glacière, which was also the nearest to Summit. It faced almost\r\ndue north and looked as if it was formerly the entrance to a mine. It\r\nwas fairly big, and my companions assured me that, until within about\r\na year, ice was always found in it. Recently, however, part, of the\r\nrock roof fell in, blocking up the entrance with a mass of débris and\r\nmaking it unsafe to venture in. Formerly parties of tourists constantly\r\nvisited this place, after coming over the Switchback, but this is no\r\nlonger done and there has been some talk of cleaning away the broken\r\nrocks and making the glacière accessible. The men also said that\r\noccasionally people living in the neighborhood had dug out the ice for\r\ntheir own use.\r\n\r\nThe other glacière was a short distance further, in the direction of\r\nCoaldale. It is in a pit, which may have been the mouth of a disused\r\nshaft or only a depression resulting from a cave-in. A scrubby forest,\r\nwhich surrounds the hollow, acts as a windbrake. A rather steep slope\r\nleads down into the pit, and at the end passes under the wall of rock\r\nof the opposite side for a short distance, forming a small cave, which\r\nfaces almost due south and whose floor is choked up with broken rock\r\nfragments. At the bottom of the slope we found some snow, and among\r\nthe boulders a good deal of snow-ice as well as several long icicles\r\nhanging from the rocks. All the ice and snow lay on the north side of\r\nthe rocks, or underneath them, so that it was in shady places where the\r\nsun could not reach it. The temperature was not at all uncomfortable,\r\nalthough somewhat cool and damp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9. Vertical Section of Pit near Summit.]\r\n\r\nThere was nothing in either glacière, to show that the ice was formed\r\nfrom any other cause than the drifting in, and melting and refreezing\r\nof the winter's snow; and my impression is that the ice in the second\r\nglacière could not last through the summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SNOW HOLE NEAR WILLIAMSTOWN.\r\n\r\nThe Snow Hole near Williamstown (Massachusetts) is situated near the\r\nnorthern end of the Petersburgh Mountain of the Taghconic Range; it is\r\nslightly below the watershed on the Williamstown side, at an altitude\r\nof about seven hundred meters. The Snow Hole is in the State of New\r\nYork, near the boundary between New York and Massachusetts. It is a\r\nlong two hours' drive from Williamstown, the last four kilometers\r\nor so, over an exceedingly steep and rough road, which is, in fact,\r\nnothing but an old logging road, and the worst I ever drove over except\r\nthe road to Démenyfálva.\r\n\r\nI visited the Snow Hole with my brother on Friday, September the 29th,\r\n1899. It is surrounded by a dense forest, mainly of recent growth,\r\nwhich thoroughly shelters it from all winds. In shape and appearance\r\nit resembles the Gorge at Ellenville, except that it is smaller: its\r\nlocation on the ridge is not unlike that of the Friedrichsteiner\r\nEishöhle. It is a narrow crack--or cave minus a roof--about fifteen\r\nmeters long, six to seven meters deep and from two to five meters wide.\r\nIt faces nearly north, and the bottom is in perpetual shadow. From the\r\nnorthern end, a gentle slope leads to the rear. The slope was a good\r\ndeal blocked up by a big tree with large branches, which had fallen\r\ndirectly into the fissure. There was some moss or greenish mould on\r\nthe rocks in places, and at the rear end of the slope there were\r\nsome fissures in the rocks, into which one might perhaps have crawled\r\na little farther, which formed a tiny cave. There was also a similar\r\nincipient cave at the northern end. I could not detect any draughts\r\nissuing from these rock fissures, and the air throughout was still,\r\nalthough the wind was blowing hard on the ridge. The rocks were moist\r\nin places and the air damp, but there was neither snow nor ice and the\r\ntemperatures were normal. The driver told me that he had found plenty\r\nof snow in the base of the gorge some years ago in July; and he said\r\nthat he had always heard that snow was found in the Snow Hole all the\r\nyear round. All the conditions of the place, the shape of the fissure,\r\nand its sheltered northern exposition, are favorable to the retention\r\nof ice and snow, and it is not surprising that they remain over every\r\nspring.\r\n\r\n\r\nICY GULF NEAR GREAT BARRINGTON.\r\n\r\nThe Icy Gulf or Icy Glen is some eight kilometers from Great\r\nBarrington, Massachusetts. I have not been in it, but was told in\r\nOctober, 1899, by the farmers living near by, that after snowy winters,\r\nice remains over through July. It must be similar to the Icy Glen at\r\nStockbridge.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ICE BED OF WALLINGFORD.\r\n\r\nThe Ice Bed of Wallingford is situated about three kilometers to the\r\neast of Wallingford, Vermont. A drive of half an hour, over the Mount\r\nHolly and Hearburrow roads, takes the visitor to the entrance of a\r\nrough wood path, which, at a distance of three or four hundred meters,\r\nleads to the Ice Bed. This is a huge talus, at the base of the White\r\nRock Mountain, whose cliffs rise steeply overhead for some three or\r\nfour hundred meters. The talus, which was doubtless formed by a great\r\nslide at some distant date, consists of granite boulders, some of which\r\nare big ones. The ice-bearing portion may be some thirty or forty\r\nmeters high vertically. It lies in a sort of gully or rock basin, and\r\nat the top is about thirty meters broad, tapering to a point at the\r\nbottom. The talus faces southward, and during a good part of the day\r\nthe sun shines full upon it. A thin forest fringes the sides and grows\r\nround the bottom, but this can afford but little protection from the\r\nwinds, especially to those from the south.\r\n\r\nI visited this place on the 5th of October, 1899. There was a distinct\r\ndrop in temperature as we neared the base of the talus, and a cool air\r\ndrew gently down over the rocks. I think slight draughts issued from\r\nsome of the crevices; but of this I am not sure. The temperature was\r\nsub-normal, about 8°, but hardly low enough to prove the presence of\r\nice, although we could see our breaths distinctly. We looked carefully\r\nunder a number of the boulders, but neither ice nor snow was visible.\r\nI was assured that ice was abundant there in the past July and August,\r\nand I should think it had melted away only shortly before my visit. My\r\nimpression is, that this is a periodic glacière.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAVES NEAR WILLIAMSTOWN.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern slope of the Petersburgh Mountain of the Taghconic Range\r\nin Massachusetts, at a good deal lower altitude than the Williamstown\r\nSnow Hole and about southeast of it are some caverns, which are but\r\nlittle known. A five or six kilometer drive from Williamstown takes the\r\nvisitor to the base of the mountain, whence a rather steep ascent of\r\nabout a kilometer and a half brings him to the caves, which are in the\r\nmidst of a dense, scrub forest.\r\n\r\nThe caves were first entered, and possibly discovered, by Mr. W. F.\r\nWilliams, of Williamstown, when a boy. Since then, he has visited them\r\nmany times and explored them a good deal. They do not appear to have\r\nany name as yet, and it would seem only fitting to christen them after\r\ntheir explorer: the Williams Caves.\r\n\r\nThere are several unimportant holes in the immediate neighborhood of\r\nthe two main caves. The latter lie side by side. The rock formation is\r\nthe same as that of the Snow Hole, a dark gray slate with a few veins\r\nof quartz, and they are due also evidently to the same geological\r\ncauses. It would seem as though the mountain had tended to open or\r\ncrack at these spots and fallen apart. This seems probable, because\r\nwherever there is a projection on one side of the cracks, there is a\r\ncorresponding hollow in the opposite side. After this, water action has\r\ncome, and erosion and corrosion have worn out and carried away earthy\r\nmatter, and slowly deepened and widened the fissures. The remarkable\r\npoint in connection with the main caves, however, is that one is a\r\nnormal cave and the other a periodic glacière.\r\n\r\nI went with Mr. Williams to these caves on the 6th of October, 1899,\r\nand partially explored the glacière. On the way up, just as we left the\r\ncarriage road, a fine, three-year-old buck, in his winter coat, came\r\nbounding out of the forest; on seeing us he stopped, and after taking a\r\ngood look, quietly trotted off into the bushes.\r\n\r\nThe glacière is rather peculiar in shape and may be described as two\r\nstoried. A long slope, set at an angle of some forty degrees, and\r\ncovered with mud and dead leaves, leads down into the crack, which\r\nis from one to three meters in width. The first half of the slope is\r\nopen to the sky; the last half is covered by the rock roof, and is a\r\nreal cave. In this the floor is horizontal, the place forming a little\r\nchamber in which the daylight has almost vanished. At the exact summit\r\nof the slope a big tree grew most conveniently; and we tied to this one\r\nend of a twenty-meter Austrian Alpine Club rope, and by holding fast\r\nto it, and kneeling or sitting down in the mud in two or three places,\r\nthe descent was easy enough. It was rather difficult to scramble up the\r\nslope again, however.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10. Vertical Section of Freezing Cave near\r\nWilliamstown.]\r\n\r\nIn the floor of the little chamber there are two holes, and, stepping\r\nover these, we stood at the rear end, about eighteen meters distant\r\nfrom the beginning of the slope. My companion now set some birchbark\r\non fire and dropped it into the innermost hole, and we laid down in\r\nturn, flat on the rock floor, and craned our necks through the hole.\r\nMr. Williams thought he could see ice below us. I looked down after\r\nhim and found that I was looking into a lower chamber whose sides were\r\ninvisible. The floor was some three meters below vertically, and on\r\nthis the birchbark was burning brightly. I think I saw some ice, but\r\nI could not be sure, as there was too much smoke to see distinctly.\r\nMy companion offered to go down through the hole and get some ice; a\r\nproposition I promptly vetoed, as had anything gone wrong, I could not\r\npossibly have given him any assistance, as there was no extra rope.\r\nMr. Williams told me that he went down several times before in July or\r\nAugust, and always found ice on the slanting floor. He said he did not\r\nknow how far this lower chamber extended, nor the length of the ice\r\nfloor. One thing which makes me hesitate to think that we saw ice was,\r\nthat the temperature of the chamber where we were was not at all icy;\r\nbut probably--I had forgotten my thermometer--nearly normal.\r\n\r\nWhen we stood once more by the tree at the top of the slope, the mouth\r\nof another cave was visible about two meters below us. Mr. Williams\r\nsaid it had never looked more than a little crack before, and that the\r\nopening was much bigger than at his last visit. It was directly under\r\nthe slope by which we descended and it vanished into darkness. Its\r\ndirection led straight towards the lower chamber, and it almost surely\r\nleads to it. It seems thus that there are two hollows, one directly\r\nabove the other; and that the lower one is a glacière, while the upper\r\none is not. The cold air of winter would naturally sink into the lower\r\nchamber, and the spring thaws would furnish plenty of drip, so that\r\nthis place seems to answer every requirement of a cave glacière.\r\n\r\nBut the most interesting fact about these caves is that, while the\r\nshallower one is a glacière, the bigger and deeper one is not. This\r\nis situated about ten meters north of the glacière and the direction\r\nof the entrance is about the same. Mr. Williams has found snow and\r\nice in May in the entrance pit as far as the daylight goes, but none\r\nbeyond. I am inclined to think that the explanation of this is the fact\r\nthat the cave is a _ganghöhle_ or tunnel cave. Mr. Williams described\r\nit as a narrow passage with chambers, and at least a hundred meters\r\nlong, and fifty meters in depth below the surface. The cold air sinks\r\nin a certain distance, but as the passage is narrow and long, and too\r\nwinding for any strong draughts, the cold air which enters is soon\r\nneutralized by the supply of warmer air within and by contact with the\r\nrocks. I cannot help thinking that it is by some such explanation that\r\nwe must hope to solve the problem of why certain caves are glacières\r\nand others in the immediate neighborhood normal caves; and the caves\r\nnear Williamstown are exceptional in presenting the problem so\r\npatently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSES OF SUBTERRANEAN ICE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CAUSES OF SUBTERRANEAN ICE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Terminology._--Ice enduring the entire year is found, in temperate\r\nlatitudes, in a variety of forms and in several different kinds of\r\nplaces. In some cases it is entirely above the surface of the earth;\r\nin others it is entirely beneath the surface of the earth. These are\r\nthe extremes, and between them there are certain intermediate forms.\r\nThe perennial ice above ground of temperate regions has gradually\r\nbecome known in English by the French word _glacier_, but strange to\r\nsay, there is no term in use in English which accurately describes the\r\nperennial ice formations which are partially or completely underground.\r\nThus the term \"ice cave\" is applied to a rock cavern containing ice,\r\nand the term \"ice gorge\" to a rock gorge containing ice. Both terms\r\nare misleading, because the character of the contents is mentioned\r\nbefore the nature of the geological formation. We say correctly enough\r\n\"limestone cave\" or \"lava cave\" and, in my opinion, we should apply the\r\nterm \"ice cave\" in a similar manner to the hollows in the ice at the\r\nlower end of glaciers, whence the glacier waters make their exit. These\r\nare really \"ice caves,\" that is caves with sides and roof made of ice.\r\nAnother trouble of the term \"ice cave,\" as applied to rock formations\r\ncontaining ice, is that it is not generic: not only is it incorrect,\r\nbut also it is not comprehensive. It does not apply to mines, tunnels,\r\nwells, gullies, boulder taluses, or underground ice sheets. If \"ice\r\ncave\" is used, except in its true sense of glacier ice cave, it seems\r\nat least as though it should be so only for real caves which retain\r\nice, as opposed to taluses and wells. Curiously enough, the Germans\r\nare just as inaccurate as ourselves, for their terms _eishöhle_\r\nand _eisloch_ are absolute translations of our \"ice cave\" and \"ice\r\nhole.\" Indeed, there is no doubt that some of the incorrect notions\r\nabout subterranean ice formations, are due to the inaccuracy of the\r\nterminology.\r\n\r\nThe only language, so far as I know, which has a correct and really\r\ngeneric term for subterranean ice formations, is the French in its word\r\n_glacière_. The French and Swiss say _glacières naturelles_ of ice\r\ndeposits formed naturally underground; and _glacières artificielles_\r\nof ice houses. _Glacière naturelle_ is comprehensive and accurate. It\r\ncovers all the rock formations and suggests also the mode of formation\r\nof the ice. It likewise implies the strong resemblance between natural\r\nice deposits and artificial ice houses. It might be well, therefore,\r\nif the French term _glacière_ were adopted as a generic term for all\r\nunderground ice formations. As, however, there is little likelihood of\r\nthis happening, the question arises as to the best English equivalent\r\nor equivalents. These seem to be \"freezing cavern, freezing talus,\"\r\netc., \"natural refrigerator\" or \"subterranean ice formation.\" \"Natural\r\nrefrigerator\" and \"subterranean ice formation\" are more generic than\r\n\"freezing cavern, freezing well,\" etc.; but the latter have the\r\nadvantage of suggesting immediately that reference is made to the\r\nhollows of the earth which at times contain ice; and, therefore, they\r\nare the best terms, perhaps, which can be chosen in English.\r\n\r\nAnother point in the terminology of this subject has reference to\r\nsubterranean hollows where draughts issue or enter. Such hollows are\r\nfound in all parts of the world and are known usually in English as\r\n\"blowing caves\" or \"cold current caves.\" The Germans speak of them as\r\n_windröhren_ or _windlöcher_. In my first paper about caves,[12] I\r\nused the word \"windhole\" which I translated from the German. The term\r\n\"windhole\" seems to me preferable to \"blowing cave\" or \"cold current\r\ncave\" in that it is more generic. It applies to taluses or boulder\r\nheaps, or in fact, to any hollows where draughts issue or enter,\r\nwhether these hollows are genuine caverns or not.\r\n\r\n[12] _Ice Caves and the Causes of Subterranean Ice_, November 1896, and\r\nMarch 1897.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary also to explain here that \"glacière\" and \"windhole\" are\r\nnot synonymous terms. It must be understood that a glacière or natural\r\nrefrigerator is a place where ice forms and endures in a subterranean\r\nor semi-subterranean situation; and that _the presence of ice_ is the\r\ncriterion of whether a place is or is not a glacière. Likewise it must\r\nbe understood that a windhole or blowing cave is an underground hollow\r\nwith at least two openings, and in which distinct draughts occur; and\r\nthat the _presence of draughts_ is necessary to constitute a place\r\na windhole or blowing cave. A freezing cavern may or may not be a\r\nwindhole, and a windhole may or may not be a freezing cavern.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Temperatures._--The phenomena of glacières are so closely connected\r\nwith temperatures that it seems necessary at this point to mention\r\nsome general facts in connection with subterranean temperatures, even\r\nif these still form a subject of some uncertainty, and one about\r\nwhich further observation is desirable. Subterranean temperatures may\r\nbe grouped under three heads: 1, Ordinary or normal temperatures;\r\n2, Temperatures above the normal or super-normal temperatures; 3,\r\nTemperatures below the normal or sub-normal temperatures.\r\n\r\n1. In the great majority of caves, cellars and subterranean places\r\nof all descriptions, the temperature of the air is about the same,\r\nall the year round, as that of the ground. The frost of winter and\r\nthe heat of summer penetrate the earth for some trivial distance, a\r\nfew meters perhaps, and lower or raise the temperature of the ground\r\ntemporarily. Below this there is a stratum where the temperature is\r\nfound to vary but little the entire year and which, in a majority\r\nof cases, approximates the mean annual temperature of the district.\r\nBelow this invariable stratum, the temperature generally rises\r\nslowly, not at exactly the same rate everywhere, but in a regular\r\nincrease. This increase of temperature averages 1° C. for every 32\r\nmeters. As most caves and cellars are of small depth and as they take\r\ntheir temperatures from that of the ground, it follows that as a rule\r\ntheir temperatures are moderate and pleasant. And as the air of the\r\nmajority of caves and subterranean hollows is about the same as the\r\ntemperature of the surrounding rock, it is correct to call subterranean\r\nair temperatures closely approximating the ordinary temperature of the\r\nground, ordinary or normal temperatures.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, with an increase of depth, there is, in almost all\r\ncases, a regular increase of temperature. For this reason, mines, which\r\nare much the deepest hollows reached by man in the surface of the\r\nearth, are, as a rule, warmer in the lower levels: if deep, they are\r\nalso hot. And this is so generally the case that warmer temperatures at\r\nthe bottom of mines may be considered as normal.\r\n\r\n2. In a few hollows close to the surface, there are temperatures much\r\nabove the normal temperature of the ground. Such places are rare and\r\nabnormal.[13] The heat is generally due to the presence of hot springs\r\nor to some volcanic action in the immediate neighborhood. In the case\r\nof one cave close to the surface, the heat is due to some limekilns\r\nwhich are situated immediately overhead.[14] Where these warm hollows\r\nare genuine caves it seems proper to call them \"hot caves.\"\r\n\r\n[13] Kraus. _Höhlenkunde_, page 86.\r\n\r\n[14] Grotte du Jaur. _Les Abimes_, page 160.\r\n\r\n3. In a number of places, there are abnormally low temperatures\r\nunderground either for the whole or only for part of the year.\r\nAlthough commoner than hot caves, yet the underground places with low\r\ntemperatures are also rare and abnormal. They may be divided into two\r\ngroups: 1, Those where the temperatures are lower than the normal,\r\nwithout becoming low enough for ice to form; and 2, Those where the\r\ntemperature sinks so low, that ice forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to make definite divisions among the various forms of\r\nnatural refrigerators, but it is correct, probably, to classify them\r\nunder five heads, in accordance with the different kinds of formations\r\nof the hollows in the rocks:\r\n\r\n1. Gullies, gorges, and troughs where ice and snow remain.\r\n\r\n2. Soil or rocks overlaying ice sheets.\r\n\r\n3. Taluses and boulder heaps retaining ice.\r\n\r\n4. Wells, mines and tunnels in which ice sometimes forms.\r\n\r\n5. Caves with abnormally low temperatures, and often containing ice.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. _Gorges and Troughs._--Gullies, gorges and basins which retain snow\r\nand ice are fairly numerous in mountain districts. They are generally\r\nravines, or rock fissures, or hollows, in positions below the snow line\r\nwhere snow and ice are sufficiently protected, from sun and wind, to\r\nremain long after snow in the surrounding open country, at the same\r\naltitude, has melted away. Some of these gorges are small, some big. As\r\na rule, they are deep and narrow.\r\n\r\nIn north-eastern Siberia, a form of permanent surface ice is found,\r\nwhich the Tungusses speak of as _tarinnen_, which means \"ice troughs\"\r\nor \"ice valleys.\"[15] These _tarinnen_ are broad valleys, with either\r\na horizontal floor or one sloping gently in the form of a trough, over\r\nwhich the ice is spread in the form of a sheet. The Tungusses assert\r\nthat the ice in some of these troughs never wholly melts away, although\r\nit lessens in quantity from the beginning of May till the end of\r\nAugust, after which it once more increases.\r\n\r\n[15] _Bulletin de la classe physico-mathématique de l'Académie\r\nImpériale des Sciences de St. Pétersbourg._ 1853. Vol. XI, pages\r\n305-316.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Subterranean Ice Sheets._--In several places in different parts of\r\nthe world there are underground ice sheets which extend over large\r\nspaces; they are common under the tundras of Alaska; and there are fine\r\nexamples on Kotzebue Sound,[16] on the Kowak River,[17] and along the\r\nYukon River.[18] The \"Ice Spring\" in Oregon seems to be a formation of\r\nthe same kind. Several examples of these subterranean ice sheets are\r\nreported also from different parts of the Russian Empire.\r\n\r\n[16] See Part III: page 167.\r\n\r\n[17] See Part III: page 167.\r\n\r\n[18] See Part III: page 166.\r\n\r\nA somewhat different kind of ice sheet was observed on Mount Etna. Sir\r\nCharles Lyell[19] speaks of it as a \"glacier preserved by a covering\r\nof lava.\" He says Signor Mario Gemmellaro satisfied himself that\r\nnothing but a flowing of lava over snow could account for the position\r\nof the glacier. Ice sheets somewhat similar to these are reported\r\nfrom Tierra del Fuego,[20] and probably also such sheets occur in\r\nIceland; and enormous heaps of ice covered with sand are found on Mount\r\nChimborazo.[21] On the northwestern coast of Greenland, glaciers, whose\r\nflow has stopped, were observed buried under an accumulation of moss\r\nand grass.[22]\r\n\r\n[19] _Principles of Geology_, 11th Edition, Chap. XXVI.\r\n\r\n[20] See Part III: page 190.\r\n\r\n[21] See Part III: page 189.\r\n\r\n[22] See Part III: page 165.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Taluses and Boulder Heaps._--Taluses and broken debris, and in general\r\nboulder heaps of all sorts, have interstices and openings between the\r\nboulders, and in these it occasionally happens that ice is found. This\r\nis most common among the taluses at the base of cliffs, but in some\r\ncases ice is found among broken rocks on the sides of gently sloping\r\nhills, or even on the plateaus of their summits. Sometimes the ice\r\nand snow on the bottom of rock gorges all melts away, while further\r\ndown, in the hollows of the boulders forming the floor, ice still\r\nremains. The rocks of which these ice bearing taluses are formed are\r\ngenerally gneiss, granite, limestone, sandstone, basalt or porphyry.\r\nAmong such boulder taluses the phenomenon designated as _Windröhren_\r\nor _Ventarolen_, that is, windholes, is frequently found. Sometimes\r\nthe air among such boulder formations is quiet, but as a general thing\r\ndraughts pour out at the lower openings during the hot months, and blow\r\ninto them during the cold ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Freezing Wells, Mines and Tunnels._--Subterranean ice is also found in\r\ncertain places in connection with man's handiwork. In a few wells in\r\nthe United States, the temperature in winter becomes abnormally low,\r\nand for four or five months these wells freeze up and become useless.\r\nA case of a freezing well was recently observed near la Ferté Milon in\r\nCentral France.[23] Ice is reported also as forming in various mines in\r\nEurope, Asia and America; in fact, it is not an uncommon occurrence.\r\nOccasionally, also, ice forms in tunnels.\r\n\r\n[23] See Part I.: pages 74, 79, 89. Part III.: page 206.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cold Caves._--Caves with abnormally low temperatures may be divided\r\ninto two classes. First, caves where the temperatures are lower than\r\nthe normal, without becoming low enough for ice to form; and second,\r\ncaves where the temperatures sink so low, that ice forms.\r\n\r\nCaves where the temperatures sink below the normal, but in which ice\r\ndoes not form either in winter or in summer, are found in several\r\nplaces in different parts of the world. They are termed in French\r\n_cavernes froides_ and in German _kalte höhlen_. There are but few data\r\nfrom reliable observers about such cold caves. Some descriptions are\r\ngiven without thermometric measurements, and the statements that the\r\ncaves are cold, mean nothing beyond the fact that they feel colder than\r\nthe outside air. It is, however, conclusively proved that cold caves\r\nexist, and that while they are not freezing caverns, yet that they have\r\na temperature lower than the mean annual temperature of their district.\r\nIn fact, the assumption, which had passed into an axiom, that caves\r\nalways have the same temperatures as the mean annual temperature of\r\nthe district, must certainly be given up. Cold caves are generally in\r\none of two shapes: 1, in the shape of a sand glass,--two cones above\r\neach other meeting at the narrowest point--where the upper cone lets\r\nthe heavy cold air descend easily, while the lower bell shaped cone\r\nprevents its escape; and 2, where two sink holes open into one pit,\r\nwhich is in the shape of a bell.[24]\r\n\r\n[24] _Les Abimes_, page 563.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Glacière Caves or Freezing Caves._--Caves where the temperatures\r\nsink so low that ice is able to form, are found in many different\r\nrock formations and in various positions, shapes and sizes. The rock\r\nformation of freezing caverns is generally limestone, but sometimes it\r\nis marble, lava, basalt, gneiss or granite. In all cases, however, the\r\nrock is either porous or else it is broken and fissured, as otherwise\r\nthe water supply necessary to the formation of ice could not find its\r\nway in.\r\n\r\nGlacière caverns may, for the sake of convenience, be classified into\r\nseveral classes, according to their position or to their form. The\r\nlines of transition between them, however, are so indefinite in nature,\r\nthat it is often difficult to specify a cavern as belonging to any\r\nspecial type. The most important factor in classifying glacière caves\r\nis their position. Under this head there are two main divisions: first,\r\npit caves; second, cliff caves.\r\n\r\nPit caves are those where a pit or pits open into the ground, and the\r\nice is found at the bottom. Sometimes there is no roof, when the place\r\nmay be called a gorge: this occurs at Ellenville, where the roof has\r\nfallen. Again, the pit itself is more or less roofed over and the ice\r\nis found mainly or wholly under the roof: this is the case at Haut\r\nd'Aviernoz, at the Friedrichsteinerhöhle, at Saint-Livres, and at\r\nSaint-Georges. Sometimes the pit takes the form of a descending tunnel,\r\nleading into a hall or chamber, in which the ice lies under a rock\r\nroof: this happens at Chaux-les-Passavant. In all these pit caves the\r\nbody of the cave is below the entrance, and most of them are fairly\r\nwell lighted by daylight throughout. Generally there is only one pit,\r\nbut occasionally there are two connected underground, as is the case at\r\nLa Genollière.\r\n\r\nCliff caves are those where the entrance is at the base or in the\r\nside of a cliff. Frequently the cave is in the shape of a hall or\r\nchamber, which begins directly at the entrance, and which may be large\r\nor small. This kind always has a down slope directly from the mouth.\r\nThe Kolowratshöhle, Dóbsina and the Grand Cave de Montarquis may be\r\nmentioned as examples. In some cases there is a pit at the base of\r\na cliff and there is a slope leading down to the cave, somewhat in\r\nthe form of a tunnel: this is the case at Manchester and practically\r\nalso at Roth. Again there is a more or less long gallery between the\r\nentrance and the glacière, which is always below the level of the\r\nentrance. The Schafloch, Démenyfálva and Decorah may be cited as\r\nexamples. As a rule the gallery slopes down from the entrance, but\r\nsometimes the floor rises and then sinks to the glacière. The top of\r\nthe entrance, however, is always higher than the highest point of the\r\nfloor, as otherwise the cold air could not get in. This is the case at\r\nthe Frauenmauerhöhle, and, apparently, also at the Posselthöhle. In one\r\ncase, at Amarnath in Kashmere, the floor is said to rise to the roof at\r\nthe back; but as the entrance is nearly as big as the floor area, the\r\nice formations must also be below the level of the top of the entrance.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of glacière caves vary greatly. Some are large, others\r\nare small. Saint Georges, a roofed pit cave, is some twenty-five\r\nmeters by twelve meters, with a depth of about twelve meters.\r\nChaux-les-Passavant, a cave at the end of a pit tunnel, has a diameter\r\nof some twenty-seven meters. The measures of Dóbsina, a cave at the\r\nbottom of a cliff, are given as follows: Height of roof above ice\r\nfloor, 10 to 11 meters; length 120 meters; breadth, 35 to 60 meters,\r\nand surface about 4644 meters. The Frauenmauerhöhle is a gallery about\r\none hundred meters long before the ice floor is reached, and this is\r\nsome fifty meters more in length by about seven meters in width. The\r\nglacière cave near Frain, on the contrary, is so small that one can\r\nonly crawl in some two or three meters. In fact, glacière caves vary in\r\nsize between great halls and little tunnels where one cannot stand up\r\nstraight.\r\n\r\nThe entrances of glacière caves also vary greatly in their dimensions.\r\nFor instance, the Friedrichsteinerhöhle is on one side of a huge pit\r\nand is as large and deep as the pit. Saint Georges, on the contrary,\r\nhas, near one end of the roof, a couple of holes, some three meters in\r\ndiameter. The entrance to the Schafloch is four meters wide by four\r\nmeters seventy centimeters high, while the entrance to Roth is not over\r\none meter each way.\r\n\r\nA classification of subterranean ice formations, and one which applies\r\nto all the different forms, is into permanent and periodic glacières.\r\nWhen in any underground spot, ice remains throughout the year, the\r\nplace may be called a permanent glacière; when on the contrary the ice\r\nmelts away for part of the year, the place may be called a periodic\r\nglacière. This classification, which several observers have used\r\nalready, is convenient and valuable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Movements of Air._--Another classification of glacières can be made\r\nin accordance with the movements of air underground. Glacières may be\r\ndivided into those where there are no strong draughts in summer and\r\nthose where there are draughts: or into \"apparently static caves\"; and\r\n\"dynamic caves\" or \"windholes.\" The first class includes those caves\r\nwhere there is one or more openings close together and those above the\r\nbody of the cave. In such hollows the air in summer is nearly still,\r\nwhile in winter there are distinct rotary movements of the air as\r\nsoon as the temperature outside is lower than that within. Almost all\r\nglacière caves belong to this class of caves without strong draughts\r\nin summer. Sometimes, however, ice is found in hollows where there are\r\ntwo or more openings, at different altitudes and at different ends of\r\nthe hollow, and where there are draughts. Occasionally, also, there are\r\nfissures in the sides or rear of apparently static caves, which allow\r\nsomething like draughts at times, as is the case at the Grand Cave de\r\nMontarquis.\r\n\r\nProfessor Thury of Geneva coined the terms \"static cave\" and \"dynamic\r\ncave\" which have come largely into use since, and which practically\r\ncorrespond to the German terms _eishöhle_ and _windröhre_. I do not\r\nthink the term \"static cave\" accurate, and prefer the term \"apparently\r\nstatic cave\" or \"cave without distinct draughts.\" For although there\r\nare many caves where the air seems stagnant at times, and there are no\r\ndistinct perceptible draughts, still that the air is really stagnant\r\nall summer appears to me doubtful, and it seems as if the movements of\r\nair were distinctly apparent only in certain caves and not in others.\r\nAir which is apparently stagnant is found in both pit and cliff caves\r\nmainly in the summer months, but even in these I have noticed several\r\ntimes in summer slight movements of air, especially near the entrance.\r\nI could not exactly feel the air moving, but by lighting a cigar the\r\nsmoke could be seen borne outwards exceedingly slowly. At the entrance\r\nof the Kolowratshöhle I think there was a faint outward current when I\r\nwas there. The day was hot and windless, and as the cold air met the\r\nhot outside air it formed a faint cloud or mist at the mouth of the\r\ncavern. At Saint-Georges, although the air seemed tranquil, I found\r\nthat the smoke of my cigar ascended rapidly just below the hole in the\r\nroof, showing an ascending air current. In the double cave of Chapuis,\r\nI found one cavern filled by a little lake over which there was a\r\ndraught.[25]\r\n\r\n[25] See Part IV.: Butler, page 308.\r\n\r\nFrom the few winter observations we have, there can be no doubt that in\r\nwinter the movements of the atmosphere are lively, the break in the air\r\ncolumn occurring as soon as the outside temperature is lower than that\r\nwithin, when the outer air immediately begins to sink into the cave.[26]\r\n\r\n[26] See Part III.: Chaux-les-Passavant, page 203; Saint-Georges, page\r\n220.\r\n\r\nIf I have doubts as to the existence of absolutely static caves, it is\r\ndifferent about dynamic caves. When a subterranean hollow goes through\r\nrocks, with one opening higher than the other, there will surely be\r\ndistinct draughts. These dynamic caves exist in many parts of the world\r\nunder such names as cold current caves or blowing caves or windholes.\r\nSometimes they are fissures in broken limestone. Often they are the\r\ncracks between piles of boulders. A cool air generally pours from the\r\nlower opening in summer while the cold air pours into it in winter, the\r\ndraught being then reversed. At the upper opening the operation takes\r\nplace in the opposite way, the hot air being sucked in in summer, and\r\ngiven out in winter. Sometimes, however, changes take place, according\r\nto the differences in the outside temperature, in the direction of the\r\nair current in the course of a single day.\r\n\r\nThe causes of the movements of air in these windholes are exceedingly\r\nsimple. The movements of air depend on the fact that in summer the air\r\nin the tube becomes colder from contact with the rocks and, therefore,\r\nheavier than the air outside, and by gravity the heavy inside air\r\ndisplaces the lighter outside air and comes rushing out at the lower\r\nopening. This leaves a vacuum, which is filled by the warmer air\r\ndropping into the tube from above. In winter on the contrary, the air\r\nwithin the tube is warmed by contact with the rocks and becomes lighter\r\nthan the air outside. It, therefore, rises and streams out from the\r\nupper opening, and the vacuum is filled by the heavy cold air pushing\r\nin at the lower opening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. Vertical Section of a Windhole.]\r\n\r\nG. F. Parrot's[27] explanation is so satisfactory that I give it with\r\none or two changes. He considers the air movements an ordinary statical\r\nphenomenon of the air, in caves which have two openings at different\r\naltitudes. Let E G D represent the section of such a cave with the\r\nopenings A and B. Let us think that there are over C and B two vertical\r\nair columns and from B to C a horizontal air column B C; then the two\r\nair columns over B and C are at all times of the year equal in weight.\r\nNot so the air columns A C and A E G D B, because their temperatures\r\nare different. Assume the temperature in the cave G is +12° the whole\r\nyear round. If in summer the air column A C is at a temperature of\r\n+25°, then the heavy air in the cave G pours out through A and is\r\nreplaced by air flowing in through B. If in winter the air column A\r\nC is at a temperature of -1°, then the air pours with equal inverse\r\nvelocity at A into the cave, and out at B. The velocity of the current\r\nin both cases depends on the difference of temperature within and\r\nwithout.\r\n\r\n[27] _Grundriss der Physik der Erde und Geologie_, 1815, pages 92-99.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing explanation makes it evident that the movements of air\r\nin these windholes do not depend on the presence of ice. In many of\r\nthose I have examined myself there was no ice visible, and from the\r\ntemperature of the air current, there could not have been any ice\r\nwithin the mountain. Still, there are numerous cases where ice is found\r\nin windholes among boulders, and a few cases where windholes exist in\r\nconnection with apparently static glacière caves. Undoubtedly the great\r\nmajority of windholes do not contain ice in summer, or, indeed, at any\r\ntime of the year, and, as far as I can see, windholes, according to\r\ntheir temperatures, belong rather to the class of normal caves than to\r\nthat of glacières.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Forms of Ice._--Almost all the forms assumed by underground ice are\r\ndifferent from those assumed by overground ice. This is not surprising,\r\nas the conditions, under which the ice is formed, are so different.\r\nAlmost all the lines of underground ice are rounded. The sharp angles\r\nand fractures visible on glacier or iceberg are absent. Instead of\r\nseracs and crevasses, broken ice falls, or piled up ice floes, we have\r\nhanging stalactites and rising stalagmites, smooth ice floors and\r\ncurved ice slopes. This difference is of course due to the fact that\r\nmost subterranean ice is formed from the drip from the roof or the\r\nsides of caves, and because the factor of motion--which plays so large\r\na part in the shaping by fracture of overground ice--is practically\r\nwanting.\r\n\r\nThe most striking forms of subterranean ice are the ice stalactites\r\nand stalagmites. They descend from the roof as icicles or rise from it\r\nas rough cones or pyramids. The icicles are of all sorts of shapes and\r\nsizes: sometimes they are tiny; sometimes they grow downward till they\r\nreach the floor and form regular columns, in some cases no less than\r\neleven meters in height.\r\n\r\nThe ice stalagmites likewise are of all sorts of shapes and sizes, some\r\nof them growing to a height of seven or eight meters. Occasionally they\r\nhave hollow bases, but this is rare. How these hollow cones are formed\r\nis a still uncertain matter; but it is in some way by the action of\r\nthe drip. At the Kolowratshöhle I saw the drip from the roof cutting\r\nout in July the basin, whose tall remaining sides suggested that early\r\nin the spring it was probably a hollow cone. The cone at the Schafloch\r\nof which I saw one half remaining, could only be accounted for by\r\nsome action from the drip.[28] The warmth of the rock floor may help\r\nperhaps also, in melting away some of the base of the hollow columns.\r\n\r\n[28] See Part IV.: Thury, page 287; Browne, page 290.\r\n\r\nThe frozen waterfalls which issue from fissures in the rock walls of\r\ncaves are another form of ice seen only below ground. For lack of a\r\nbetter name, I call them fissure columns. A peculiarity of these is\r\nthat, while the rock fissure is more or less rectangular or at least\r\nsharp angled, the ice column issues in a rounded stream. Sometimes\r\nthese fissure columns stream over the rock; sometimes they spring out\r\nfar enough from the rock to be quite away from it. They vary from about\r\none to five meters in height, and at the base they almost always spread\r\nout in a shape resembling that of a fan.\r\n\r\nThe ice on the bottom of caverns of course takes its shape from the\r\nform and angles of the floor of the caves. If the bottom is level or\r\nnearly so, the ice lies on it as a sheet or floor. If the bottom of the\r\ncave is sloping, the ice follows the angles of the slope, forming an\r\nice slope or ice wall, and sometimes becoming nearly or quite vertical.\r\nThese ice slopes distantly resemble the portions of glaciers called\r\nan ice fall, with the great difference, however, that there are no\r\ncrevasses, not even tiny ones.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, slabs of ice are found reposing in a fractured sheet over\r\na solid ice floor. This means that a lake has formed on this spot in\r\nthe spring, frozen over, and then run off, leaving its frozen surface\r\nin broken pieces on top of the under ice.\r\n\r\nAnother kind of frozen water is the hoar frost which forms on the\r\nrock roofs and walls. This is not at all rare. It is an open question\r\nwhether this is not the same thing as that which has been described as\r\nsubterranean snow.[29] I found myself in Dóbsina a small sheet of what\r\nto look and touch was snow. I wrote of this as snow in my first paper\r\nabout glacières[30], but I am of the opinion now that it was the hoar\r\nfrost detached from the roof and not genuine snow.\r\n\r\n[29] See Part III.: Ziegenloch, page 247; Creux de Souci, page 207.\r\n\r\n[30] _Ice Caves and the Causes of Subterranean Ice_, November, 1896,\r\nand March, 1897.\r\n\r\nAt Dóbsina, also, I noticed that the ice of the ice wall of the\r\nKorridor assumed a stratified or laminated form. Mr. John F. Lewis\r\nof Philadelphia suggested to me that this was probably due to a\r\nprecipitation of the hoar frost from the roof, and I think his\r\nexplanation is correct. The hoar frost forming at a certain degree of\r\ncold, would doubtless be precipitated at a rise of temperature, and\r\nwould then act much as do the different layers of snow in the upper\r\nportion of glaciers.[31] It would consolidate gradually, layer over\r\nlayer, and form strata, producing the banded or laminated structure\r\nvisible in the vertical ice of the Dóbsina Korridor.\r\n\r\n[31] Whymper: _Scrambles amongst the Alps_, 1871, page 426.\r\n\r\nThe ice in caverns is sometimes found with a structure which is, I\r\nbelieve, of rare occurrence above ground. This is when it takes the\r\nshape known as prismatic ice, which means that if a lump is broken\r\nfrom a column or icicle, the fracture will show regular prisms. This\r\nphenomenon is not as yet satisfactorily accounted for; the only thing\r\ncertain about it is, that it does not occur in ice of recent formation.\r\nFrom my own observations, I should say that ice became prismatic at the\r\nend of summer; at least I have always found it in August or September\r\nrather than in June or July.[32]\r\n\r\n[32] See Part IV.: Browne, page 289; Lohmann, page 303.\r\n\r\nBesides building up ice heaps, the drip, also, has the function of\r\ndestroying its own creations. If there are no crevasses, there are\r\nholes and runnels. These are generally found at or leading to the\r\nlowest point of the ice floor. Occasionally the holes are deep,\r\nsometimes many meters in depth. They are certainly cut out by the\r\nmelting water, to which they offer an exit; in fact they are a part of\r\nthe drainage system present in all glacière caves, where there must be\r\nsome outlet for surplus water at or near the lowest point: and as the\r\ncaves are always in porous or broken rock, the drainage takes place\r\nthrough the cracks and fissures.\r\n\r\nThe drip produces also the exact opposite of pyramids in the shape of\r\nice basins. These are cut in the floor by an extra strong drip from\r\nthe roof at those spots. Basins exactly like these are not seen on\r\nglaciers. Not infrequently they are full of water of considerable depth.\r\n\r\nLakes and pools are found in glacière caves. Sometimes they are on\r\nthe ice floor, and in this case they are due either to rain-water\r\ncollecting faster than it can flow off, or else because the cave is in\r\na state of thaw. Sometimes these pools are among the rocks in one part\r\nof a cave, while the ice is in another part.\r\n\r\nI have said above that motion in subterranean ice is practically\r\nwanting. This is proved by the lack of crevasses on the ice slopes\r\nor ice walls, and also by the fact that basins and cones appear year\r\nafter year in the same spots, where they remain whether they are\r\nincreasing or diminishing. But this statement cannot be held to cover\r\nthe entrance snow and ice slopes of some of the open pit caves such as\r\nthe Gottscheer cave, or Saint-Livres or Haut d'Aviernoz. Here the snow,\r\nwhich falls on the entrance slope, must gradually gravitate to the\r\nbottom. The question is whether it only descends in the shape of water\r\nafter melting or as snow before solidifying; or whether it ever slides\r\ndown at all after becoming somewhat solidified. Probably, however, the\r\nice of these slopes, judging from the fact that crevasses are entirely\r\nlacking, remains stationary.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Color Effects._--The color effect of every glacière cavern has a\r\ncertain individuality, according to the color of the rocks, the\r\nquantity of ice, and the amount of daylight admitted through the\r\nentrance. In my opinion, the white note given by the ice, makes a fine\r\nglacière cave the most beautiful of all subterranean hollows. In this\r\nrespect it seems to me that they are similar to high Alps, which are\r\ncertainly most impressive with coverings of snow and glacier.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, two distinct notes in the color effects of glacière\r\ncaves and these may be described as the partly subterranean, or as the\r\nwholly subterranean. In the former case the local tints stand out more\r\nclearly. For instance, at the Kolowratshöhle the ice is beautifully\r\ntransparent and of a pale ochre-greenish hue: the limestone rocks\r\nare streaked with iron, and thus have a reddish hue, while, owing\r\nto the entrance admitting plenty of daylight, the effect is only\r\nsemi-subterranean. Again, at Chaux-les-Passavant plenty of daylight is\r\nadmitted: the rocks are a yellowish brown, and the ice is white and\r\nblue. At the Schafloch or the Frauenmauer, on the contrary, the effect\r\nis wholly subterranean: daylight is so completely absent that black\r\nis the predominating note, the ice itself looking gray. Dóbsina is an\r\nexception, as, thanks to the electric light, white is the conspicuous\r\ntone, even though rocks and shadows dull many places and corners into a\r\nsombre gray.\r\n\r\nMore than once, on returning to daylight from the intense blackness\r\nof a cave, I have seen the rocks near the entrance appear a dark\r\nblue color, exactly simulating moonlight. This effect is common to\r\nboth glacière caves and ordinary caverns. It is a striking but rare\r\nphenomenon, and depends apparently on the shape of the cave. This\r\nmoonlight effect only seems to occur when a cave makes an elbow\r\ndirectly after the mouth and then goes straight for some distance. When\r\nthe daylight is actually in sight, the moonlight impression vanishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Carbonic Acid Gas._--Carbonic acid gas, judging from the most\r\nrecent explorations, is more of a rarity in rock caves with normal\r\ntemperatures than is generally supposed. There appears to be only one\r\ncase on record where this gas was observed in a cold cave. This was\r\nin the Creux-de-Souci,[33] which is rather a cold than a freezing\r\ncavern, but which on one occasion was found to contain snow, and\r\nwhose temperature is always extremely low. From the present state of\r\nknowledge, therefore, it may be assumed that if carbonic acid gas does\r\nform in glacière caves, it does so only seldom.\r\n\r\n[33] See Part III.: page 207.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fauna._--No attention whatever has been paid, practically as yet, as\r\nto whether any distinctive animal life exists in glacières. So far, I\r\nhave seen none myself. The Rev. G. F. Browne, in four instances, found\r\na large red-brown fly nearly an inch long, which is supposed to be\r\n_Stenophylax Hieroglyphicus_ of Stephens; and at Chapuis, he obtained\r\nan ichneumon of the genus _Paniscus_. At Font d'Urle, Monsieur Villard\r\ncaptured a blind specimen of a coleoptera, _Cytodromus dapsoïdes_.\r\nA variety of rotifer, _Notholca longispina_, is now living in the\r\nCreux-de-Souci. In Skerisora, remains of bats have been found, not very\r\ndifferent from those now living in the neighborhood.[34] It is, in any\r\ncase, certainly remarkable that the same kind of fly should have been\r\ndiscovered in several glacières in different localities; and it may\r\nsome day be shown that there is a special insect fauna. Certainly the\r\nsubject is worth investigating.[35]\r\n\r\n[34] See Part I.: Ausable Pond, page 81, and Part III.: Creux-de-Souci,\r\npage 207; Font d'Urle, page 213; Chapuis, page 216; La Genollière, page\r\n219; Skerisora, page 245.\r\n\r\n[35] In June, 1899, I mentioned these facts to Monsieur Armand Viré,\r\ndirector of the Biologic Laboratory in the catacombs of the Jardin\r\ndes Plantes in Paris. He was much interested, and promised to make a\r\ncareful investigation of the matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Flora._--The flora of glacières has been as little observed as the\r\nfauna. There are scarcely any references to such a thing as glacière\r\nplant life in literature. Whether there is a special flora in any\r\nglacière cave is still an open question. In the cases of several\r\nboulder taluses, there is no doubt that, even if there is not a special\r\nflora, at least that the plants near the ice beds are greatly retarded\r\nevery year in their development. Probably the flora among the boulders\r\nblooms a month or six weeks later than the flora in the immediate\r\nvicinity. In the cases of the Cave of Paradana and of the Kuntschner\r\nEishöhle it is reported that the plant life becomes more and more\r\narctic in character towards the bottom of the pit.[36]\r\n\r\n[36] See Part I.: Ausable Pond, page 80; Giant of the Valley, page 83,\r\nnote 7; Ice Gulch, page 85; Spruce Creek, page 91. See Part III: Spruce\r\nCreek, page 188; Paradana, page 237; Kuntschner Eishöhle, page 241.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paleontology._--No paleontological remains have as yet been reported\r\nfrom glacière caves. No bones of animals have been found, except those\r\nof bats in Skerisora[37] and a few of the common genus _bos_.[38]\r\nNo relics of the handiwork of man have been discovered; nor, indeed,\r\nwith the exception of the skeletons found in the cave of Yeermallik in\r\nKondooz,[39] anything which reveals the presence of man in glacières or\r\nthat they were ever used for habitation. The reason that there are so\r\nfew remains in glacière caves is undoubtedly because their temperatures\r\nare too low for their occupation by animal or man; but, from the\r\nevidence afforded by their non-occupation, may be drawn the valuable\r\ninference that the glacière caves of to-day were glacière caves long\r\nago.\r\n\r\n[37] See Part III.: Skerisora, page 245.\r\n\r\n[38] See Part I.: Saint-Livres, page 68.\r\n\r\n[39] See Part III.: Yeermallik, page 261.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Legends and Religion._--There are scarcely any legends connected\r\nwith glacières. I know only of one about one of the caves of the Mont\r\nParmelan.[40] Nor does there seem to be any reference to glacière caves\r\nin works of fiction. Dante makes his last hell full of an ice lake, but\r\nan attentive perusal fails to reveal a single line which in any way\r\ndescribes or suggests a glacière. In at least two cases,[41] however,\r\nthe ice in caves is connected with religion, as in Kashmere, the\r\nHindoos, and in Arizona, the Zuni Indians, either worship or pray at\r\nglacière caves, overawed, from some mystical feeling, by the permanence\r\nof the ice formations which they connect with their deities.\r\n\r\n[40] See Part III.: Glacière de l'Enfer, page 216.\r\n\r\n[41] See Part III.: Amarnath, page 262; Cave, White Mountains, Arizona,\r\npage 176.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cause of the formation of subterranean ice is undoubtedly one\r\nof the most intricate problems in connection with caverns. Various\r\ntheories have been advanced why ice is found in certain caves and not\r\nin others. Some writers have held that it is a remnant of a glacial\r\nperiod; others that it is owing to the presence of salts in the rocks;\r\nsome have said that it is due to the rocks retarding waves of heat\r\nand cold; and still others think that it is formed by pressure on\r\nthe percolating waters. Many of these theories were formulated in\r\nexplanation of the belief of peasants living near the caves, who almost\r\nalways say that the ice is formed in summer and melts in winter. Most\r\nscientific observers on the other hand claim that the ice is due to the\r\ncold of winter, and a few think that it is formed or helped by draughts\r\nand by evaporation and expansion of the air. The variety of opinions\r\nput forth, show at any rate the intricacy of the problem.\r\n\r\nAll my own observations have tended more and more to make me believe\r\nthat the cold of winter is the cause of the ice. Before elaborating my\r\nown views, however, I wish to take up seriatim the theories which have\r\nbeen formulated, principally in explanation of the belief that the ice\r\nwas a summer product, and to give my reasons for my disbelief in them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Glacial Period._--The first theory, perhaps, to touch on, is the one\r\nthat the ice is a remnant of a glacial period. This seems to occur\r\nto many persons as a solution of the question when they first hear\r\nof glacières, and it has been several times propounded to me, and\r\nnaturally enough, always by scientific men.[42] Still I do not think it\r\nhas ever been held by anyone who had made a study of glacières.\r\n\r\n[42] See Part IV.: Hitchcock, page 284; Bonney, page 291; Dawkins, page\r\n292.\r\n\r\nThe theory is, indeed, untenable in regard to freezing caves, as it\r\ndoes not accord with the observed facts of the yearly disappearance of\r\nthe ice in many caves and taluses. At Szilize every year the ice has\r\ndisappeared pretty completely by November, and the cave is free; but\r\nin April or May the floor is again covered with ice, and columns and\r\nicicles have formed on the roof and sides. At La Genollière the cave\r\nis used by the people of the neighboring châlets, through the spring\r\nand early summer, to help in the operation of butter making; by the\r\nmiddle or the end of August it has entirely disappeared, but is found\r\nformed afresh the following spring. At the Rumney Talus, at the Cave of\r\nDecorah, at the Gorge of Ellenville, and at the Williamstown Snow Hole,\r\nI found no snow or ice.[43] Yet it is abundant in all these localities\r\nin the spring. Too many examples of the complete melting away of the\r\nice every year can be cited, to permit any doubt: glacière caves are\r\nnot connected with a glacial period.\r\n\r\n[43] See Part I.: Rumney, page 85; Decorah, page 88; Ellenville, page\r\n91; Williamstown, page 98.\r\n\r\nThough it may be stated positively that the ice in caves is not a\r\nremnant of a glacial period, yet this cannot be done so authoritatively\r\nabout subsoil ice sheets and freezing wells. At Brandon, Owego and\r\nDecorah the gravel was found frozen at the time the wells were dug, and\r\nit is of course impossible to determine for how long a time this was\r\nthe case previous to the digging. The proofs, however, are so strong\r\nthat the ice re-forms every winter at such freezing wells, that they\r\nmay be considered as in every respect following the same general laws\r\nas glacière caves. That the ice in these wells is not the remains of a\r\nglacial period, seems proved moreover by the work of the Boston Natural\r\nHistory Society, which sank two wells at Brandon near to the Freezing\r\nwell. One of these was only twenty-one meters distant and went through\r\nthe same gravel drift. Yet it did not strike ice.[44] A somewhat\r\nsimilar state of things appears to be the case with the Centennial Lode\r\nand other lodes on Mount McClellan,[45] where the causes also seem to\r\nbe local, as there is no ice in mines on neighboring mountains.\r\n\r\n[44] See Part IV.: Hager, page 282; Hitchcock, page 284.\r\n\r\n[45] See Part III.: Rifts of Ice, etc., page 174.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Summer's Heat Theory._--The natives and peasants in the\r\nneighborhood of glacière caves generally believe that the ice of\r\ncaves is formed in summer and melts in winter. I have met with this\r\nbelief everywhere in Europe; in the Eifel, Jura, Swiss Alps, Tyrolese\r\nAlps, and Carpathians: and also occasionally in the United States.\r\nPeasants and guides tell you with absolute confidence: \"The hotter the\r\nsummer the more ice there is.\" The strange thing is that any number\r\nof writers[46]--sometimes scientific men--have accepted the ideas and\r\nstatements of the peasants about the formation of ice in summer, and\r\nhave tried to account for it.\r\n\r\n[46] Among them may be mentioned: Boisot, 1686; Valvasor, 1689;\r\nBehrens, 1703; Billerez, 1712; Bel, 1739; Rosenmüller and Tillesius,\r\n1799; Sartori, 1809; Pictet, 1822; Scrope, 1826; Murchison, 1845.\r\n\r\nThe belief of the peasants is founded on the fact that they scarcely\r\never go to any cave except when some tourist takes them with him, and,\r\ntherefore, they rarely see one in winter, and their faith is not based\r\non observation. It is, however, founded on an appearance of truth:\r\nand that is on the fact that the temperatures of glacière caves, like\r\nthat of other caves or that of cellars, are colder in summer than the\r\noutside air, and warmer in winter than the outside air. Possessing\r\nneither reasoning powers nor thermometers, the peasants simply go a\r\nstep further and say that glacière caves are cold in summer and hot in\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nProfessor Thury tells a story to the point. He visited the Grand Cave\r\nde Montarquis in mid-winter. All the peasants told him there would be\r\nno use going, as there would be no ice in the cave. He tried to find\r\neven one peasant who had been to the cave in winter, but could not. He\r\nthen visited it himself and found it full of hard ice. On his return\r\nhe told the peasants of his discovery. They were staggered at first,\r\nfinally one exclaimed: \"It makes no difference; in genuine glacières\r\nthere is no ice in winter.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be difficult, probably, to eradicate this belief and the\r\nconsequent theories among the uneducated people in the vicinity of\r\nglacière caves, for their imperfect observations will keep it alive. In\r\nrefutation, it may be said that the winter's cold theory is the direct\r\nopposite of the summer's heat theory, and that all the observations and\r\nall the facts which prove the one, disprove the other.\r\n\r\nWithin two or three years, however, the formation of small quantities\r\nof ice has been observed during the summer months in one or two caves.\r\nThis has taken place in mountain caves situated at a high altitude at\r\ntimes when the air outside has dropped below freezing point during the\r\nnight. There is, therefore, nothing inconsistent in this fact with the\r\nwinter's cold theory: indeed it is only a widening of it in the meaning\r\nof the word winter.[47]\r\n\r\n[47] See Part III.: Beilsteinhöhle, page 235. Part IV.: Professor\r\nCranmer, page 310.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Chemical Causes._--Non-scientific persons, on first hearing of\r\nglacière caves, almost always suggest that to form the ice there must\r\nbe salts in the rocks. Probably they connect unconsciously in their\r\nminds \"ice caves\" and \"ice cream.\"\r\n\r\nChemical causes, however, have never appealed to scientific men.[48]\r\nThere are only two places I know of where salt is reported. One is the\r\nIce Spring in Oregon, which is said to be slightly saline in taste; the\r\nother is the Cave of Illetzkaya-Zatschita, where the gypsum hillock,\r\nin which the ice is found, overlies a bed of rock salt. Repeated\r\nexperiments in letting lumps of glacière ice melt in my mouth have\r\nconvinced me personally that in all cases the water is exceedingly\r\npure and sweet, a fact mentioned in the very first notice extant about\r\nglacières, the letter of Benigne Poissenot in 1586, who speaks of the\r\ndeliciousness of the water in Chaux-les-Passavant. To sum this matter\r\nup briefly, it can be safely asserted that all causes, which would fall\r\nunder the head of \"Chemical causes,\" must be entirely eliminated as\r\npossible cold producers.\r\n\r\n[48] See Part IV.: Billerez, page 270; Hacquet, page 271.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Waves of Heat and Cold._--While Sir Roderick Murchison was studying\r\nthe geology of Russia,[49] he visited Illetzkaya-Zatschita and was\r\npuzzled to account for the ice formations. He thought, at first, that\r\nthey were due to the presence of salt, but recognizing that this was\r\nnot correct he submitted the case to Sir John Herschel, who, rejecting\r\nthe evaporation or condensation of vapor as the cause, argued that\r\nthe ice was due to waves of heat and cold, and that at certain depths\r\nin the interior, the cold wave arrived in mid-summer and the heat in\r\nmid-winter. Murchison declined to assent to this doctrine, asking why\r\none cave should present this exceptional occurrence, when the numerous\r\nother rents and openings in the same hillock were free from ice. The\r\nimpossibility of the heat and cold wave theory was so completely shown\r\nby Murchison's objection, that it has never again been brought forward.\r\n\r\n[49] _The Geology of Russia and the Ural Mountains_, vol. I., pages\r\n184-198.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Capillary or Compressed Air Theory._--The possibility of compressed\r\nair causing subterranean ice to form seems to have been first\r\nauthoritatively formulated by Mr. N. M. Lowe, of Boston.[50] His theory\r\nin brief is this:--Bubbles of air drawn into water flowing down through\r\nfissures in rocks are liable to a continually increasing pressure. When\r\nthe air has reached the bottom and is liberated in the cave, it will be\r\nfrom a pressure equal to the height of the column of water, and it will\r\nhave lost by connection in the mass through which the conduit passes,\r\nthe heat due to its compression; and on being liberated, it will\r\nimmediately absorb from the air and the water in the cave, the heat\r\nwhich it has lost in its downward passage.\r\n\r\n[50] _Science Observer._ Boston, 1879, vol. II., page 57. See Part IV.:\r\nSilliman, page 279; Olmstead, page 282.\r\n\r\nSeveral scientific observers have rallied to this idea.[51] One of\r\nthe Hungarian residents at Dóbsina, a doctor, whose opportunities\r\nfor observations are unrivalled, told me--if I understood him\r\ncorrectly--that he believed in the capillary theory.\r\n\r\n[51] See B. Schwalbe, _Ueber Eishöhlen und Eislöcher_, page 56.\r\n\r\nThere are many facts, however, which militate against the compressed\r\nair theory as applied to caves. Almost all caves receive some drip\r\nthrough fissures, and yet there are many thousands of caves which never\r\ncontain ice, and whose temperature scarcely varies the year round.\r\nEspecially against the theory is the fact that glacière caves are\r\nnever known in hot countries. If the theory were correct we should,\r\nfor instance, sometimes find ice in such caves as those of Yucatan\r\ndescribed by Mr. Mercer.[52]\r\n\r\n[52] _The Hill Caves of Yucatan._\r\n\r\nThere are also some mechanical difficulties in the way. Mr. John\r\nRitchie[53] touches them when he says: \"If the passage through which\r\nthe water flows down is at all tubular the column will be subjected to\r\nthe usual hydrostatic pressure.\" The word _tubular_ is the hard one to\r\nanswer. Limestone rock fissures are certainly not tubular. They have\r\nall sorts of shapes and angles and corners, every one of which would\r\ninterfere with anything like a regular pressure.\r\n\r\n[53] _Boston Transcript_, January 2d, 1897.\r\n\r\nThis latter objection would not apply to borings in mines. I have been\r\nassured that in some borings in Western mines ice has been formed by\r\npressure, and there may be truth in this, although I doubt it, as\r\nI have yet to hear of ice in any mines in warm latitudes. Mr. John\r\nRitchie[54] has suggested, also, that if compressed air does not\r\nperhaps act strongly enough to form ice, yet it may help in keeping\r\nthe temperature low and aid in the formation of draughts in caves and\r\nboulder heaps. At present, however, I can see no reason to think that\r\nthe ice in caves is due to compressed air.[55]\r\n\r\n[54] _The Happy Thought._ Boston, January 23d, 1897.\r\n\r\n[55] See Part I.: page 89.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have already said that I believe that the cold of winter is the\r\ncause of the ice in caves. To make this clearer, I may say that I look\r\non glacières as the last outcrop, the outside edge, so to speak, of\r\nthe area of low temperatures, which has its culminating point in the\r\nNorthern Hemisphere in the Arctic Ocean, Greenland and Siberia, and in\r\nthe Southern Hemisphere in the Antarctic; and which is manifested to\r\nus in the snows of mountain peaks, and immediately round us in frozen\r\nponds and rivers and snowy blizzards; and which, as it disappears each\r\nsummer, leaves its last traces in our latitudes in sequestered gorges\r\nand convenient caverns. In every case, it seems to me, glacières are\r\nsimply refrigerators, which preserve the ice and snow accumulated in\r\nthem during the winter. They all follow the same general laws as to\r\nthe origin of their contents, modified only in slight degree according\r\nto the varying natural local conditions, such as the water supply, or\r\nthe protection from sun and wind, or the thickness of the overhead\r\nrock, or the altitude or latitude. I cannot see that there is anything\r\nremarkable about the fact that the cold of winter is able to penetrate\r\nand make itself felt sometimes for a slight depth in the earth's\r\ncrust; a depth, so far as yet known, never exceeding one hundred and\r\nfifty meters. It seems to me that glacières only emphasize a law of\r\nnature, which has doubtless been formulated many times in connection\r\nwith springs and phreatic waters, and that is, that where we find cold\r\nwaters underground, we may be sure that they have penetrated from the\r\noutside.\r\n\r\nIf we look first at the mode of formation of overground perennial ice,\r\nthat is, of the ice of glaciers and of rock gorges; and then at the\r\nevidences of the mode of formation of underground perennial ice, in\r\nboulder heaps, wells and caves; we will soon see that the transitions\r\nbetween them are gentle in character and that there is nothing\r\nunnatural about the formation of the ice in glacières.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Glaciers._--Everyone now knows the main characteristics of glaciers.\r\nThey are formed in parts of the earth where the land or the mountains\r\nreach to the region of perpetual snow. The snows fall from the sky, and\r\naccumulate into a snow cap, which by its own weight and by melting and\r\nregelation, gradually changes to ice. This, by the laws of gravitation,\r\ndescends to lower levels, and in mountain valleys extends sometimes\r\nfar below the snow line into the region of cultivated fields. These\r\nvalley prolongations of the perpetual snow caps are the glaciers. The\r\nimportant point to notice here, is that the formation of glaciers is\r\noriginally entirely due to the precipitation of moisture by cold in the\r\nupper portions; while the destruction of glaciers is due to the action\r\nof heat melting the ice in the lower portions, where they disappear in\r\nthe shape of streams of running water. It is, therefore, not surprising\r\nthat the greatest glaciers are found in the Arctic and Antarctic\r\nregions and in the highest mountain ranges; and that in the tropics\r\nglaciers are either wanting or exceedingly small.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gorges and Troughs._--Gorges and gullies, where ice remains over,\r\nare a transitional form between glaciers and glacières. In many\r\nmountain ravines or canyons, the enduring snow consists principally\r\nof the avalanches which have fallen from the heights above during the\r\nwinter and solidified in the bottom of the ravines. Freezing gorges\r\nproper, however, are not dependent on avalanches for their supply,\r\nbut they receive the accretions to their ice directly from the winter\r\nsnows. These fall into the gorge itself and by melting and regelation\r\ngradually solidify into a mass of ice which, when well sheltered\r\nagainst sun and wind, remains over sometimes till the following winter.\r\nBy their mode of formation, therefore, it is evident that the ice in\r\nthese gorges has some of the characteristics of glaciers; that it is\r\ndue to the same prime causes as the ice of glaciers or the ice on ponds\r\nand rivers, namely the cold of winter; and in fact, it is not far\r\nwrong to consider these gorges as miniature glaciers.\r\n\r\nFreezing gorges, however, show, also, certain degrees of kinship to\r\nfreezing caverns and taluses, principally in the protection afforded\r\nto the ice against external destructive influences. The ice is almost\r\nalways found in positions where it receives little, if any, of the\r\ndirect rays of the sun and, also, where it is scarcely, if at all,\r\nexposed to any winds. The sides of the fissures and surrounding trees\r\ngenerally afford the necessary protection. Some of the forms which the\r\nice assumes in gorges, such as long pendent icicles, are also more\r\ncharacteristic of underground than of overground ice.\r\n\r\nThe freezing troughs or basins found in Siberia are evidently closely\r\nrelated to gorges, and the fact that the ice is found in less sheltered\r\nplaces may be explained by the high northerly latitudes of these\r\ntroughs, in general between fifty-seven and sixty degrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Winter's Cold Theory._--The places where ice is found underground\r\ndiffer in one important respect from gullies and troughs, and that\r\nis, in the fact that above the ice there is rock or soil, which, in\r\ntrue caves, takes the form of a roof. This causes some important\r\ndistinctions between overground and underground perennial ice. It means\r\nthat the ice is formed directly in the caves, and that it is genuine\r\nsubterranean ice, and not, except perhaps near the entrance, solidified\r\nsnow. The roof, while not admitting the winter snows, is, however, a\r\nprotection against warm summer rains, and, of course, entirely cuts\r\noff radiation from the sky. If, therefore, it keeps out some cold, it\r\nalso acts as a protector against heat.\r\n\r\nThat the cold of winter is the source of the cold which produces the\r\nice which forms underground, and that it is through its influence,\r\nwith the assistance of certain secondary causes, that some caves are\r\nconverted into what are practically natural ice houses, seems to me\r\nthe true explanation of the phenomenon of subterranean ice, not only\r\nsince it is the simple and obvious explanation, but also because all\r\nthe facts, so far as I have myself observed, are in accord with this\r\ntheory.[56]\r\n\r\n[56] Among those who have written or said that the cold of winter plays\r\na more or less important part in the formation of subterranean ice\r\nmay be mentioned: Poissenot, 1586; Gollut, 1592; DeBoz, 1726; Nagel,\r\n1747; Cossigny, 1750; Jars, 1774; Hacquet, 1778; Girod-Chantrans, 1783;\r\nHablizl, 1788; Prévost, 1789; Townson, 1797; Humboldt, 1814; Dearborn,\r\n1822; Deluc, 1822; Dewey, 1822; Lee, 1824; Reich, 1834; Hayden, 1843;\r\nGuyot, 1856; Rogers, 1856; Petruzzi, 1857; Smyth, 1858; Hager, 1861;\r\nThury, 1861; Browne, 1865; Raymond, 1869; Krenner, 1874; Ritchie,\r\n1879; Benedict, 1881; Schwalbe, 1881; Fugger, 1883; Trouillet, 1885;\r\nGirardot, 1886; Russell, 1890; Martel, 1892; Krauss, 1894; Lohmann,\r\n1895; Balch, 1896; Cvijic, 1896; Butler, 1898; Kovarik, 1898; Cranmer,\r\n1899.\r\n\r\nTo form subterranean ice, just as to form any other ice, two things are\r\nnecessary: the first is cold, the second is water. Cold is supplied by\r\nthe cold air of winter, and water must in some manner find its way into\r\nthe cave while the cold air is there.\r\n\r\nThe process is as follows: The cold air of winter sinks into and\r\npermeates the cave, and in course of time freezes up all the water\r\nwhich, in the shape of melting snow or cold winter rain or spring\r\nwater, finds its way in; and once ice is formed it remains long after\r\nice in the surrounding open country has melted away, because heat\r\npenetrates with difficulty into the cave. The only effect of the heat\r\nof summer is to melt the ice.\r\n\r\nThe proofs, to my mind, of the truth of this view are: 1--Glacières\r\nare always found in parts of the world where, during part of the\r\nyear at least, the temperatures of the surrounding country fall\r\nbelow freezing point. 2--All observations by reliable observers\r\nshow that the temperatures of glacière caves vary, but in a much\r\nnarrower thermometric scale, with those of the outside air: that the\r\ntemperatures are lowest, and as a rule below freezing point, during the\r\nwinter months; and that the temperatures are highest, and as a rule\r\nabove freezing point, during the summer months. 3--Ice is never found\r\nfar from the mouth of caves, but always near enough for the cold air\r\nto get in. 4--Evaporation, according to my observations, is, as in all\r\nother forms of ice in nature, connected mainly with the melting, not\r\nthe freezing of the ice.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geographical Distribution and Altitudes._--Glacière caves proper\r\nare found in various parts of Europe, Asia, and America, mostly in\r\nthe smaller mountain ranges or in the outliers of the snowy mountain\r\nchains; generally in limestone and occasionally in basaltic formations.\r\nThere are a good many in the Jura; a few in the Swiss and the Italian\r\nAlps; a number in the Eastern Alps of Tyrol and Carinthia. There are\r\nsome in Hungary, several in Russia, one in Iceland, one on the Peak\r\nof Teneriffe, a number in Siberia, one in Kondooz in Central Asia,\r\none in the Himálaya, one in Japan, and one in Korea. I have heard so\r\nfar of over fifty glacières in North America, several of which are in\r\nPennsylvania. From all over the world there are some three hundred\r\nplaces reported where subterranean ice is said to occur. This includes\r\ngorges, boulder heaps and freezing mines and wells, all of which exist\r\nin much the same localities as glacière caves.\r\n\r\nAll the glacières which I know of, are situated in a latitude or at\r\nan altitude where ice and snow forms for part of the year in the\r\nsurrounding open country. None are reported from India or Africa, or\r\nin fact from any low-lying places in tropical latitudes. Most of them\r\nare found in middle latitudes, and only where during part of the year,\r\nat least, there is a cold season, that is, where for some time the\r\nthermometer stands below freezing point.\r\n\r\nGlacières are, in general, at fairly high altitudes. The Schafloch\r\nis at 1780 meters; Skerisora in Transylvania at 1127 meters; Dóbsina\r\nat 1100 meters; the Glacière de Saint-Georges at 1208 meters. It is\r\ntrue that there is one freezing cavern in the sub-tropical latitude\r\nof Teneriffe, La Cueva de la Nieve; but it is at an altitude of 3300\r\nmeters, and where snow falls every year in the open on the Peak.\r\nUnless some freezing cave is hereafter discovered in a region where\r\nthere is no ice in the open in winter, I do not see how the imperative\r\nnecessity of the cold air of winter for forming the supply of ice can\r\nbe controverted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thermometric Observations._--That the cold air of winter is the\r\nimportant factor in the production of cold is proved, also, by the\r\nthermometric observations recorded in various caves by different\r\nobservers. They all tell the same tale: that the temperatures vary with\r\nthose of the outside air, that they are lowest in winter and highest\r\nin summer. I quote in the \"List of Glacières\"[57] a few of those\r\npublished; but there are many more, and they all show the same general\r\ncharacteristics.\r\n\r\n[57] See Part III.: Decorah, page 178; Chaux-les-Passavant, pages\r\n203-5; La Poujade, page 208; Montarquis, page 218; Saint-Georges, page\r\n219; Schafloch, page 223; Kolowratshöhle, page 227; Schellenberger\r\nEisgrotte, page 228; Frain, page 252; Dóbsina, page 253; etc.\r\n\r\nA comparison of all the figures recorded proves that, as a rule--inside\r\nof glacière caves--from about the first of November to the first\r\nof July, there are winter temperatures, that is temperatures below\r\nfreezing point; and from about the first of July to the first of\r\nNovember, there are summer temperatures, that is temperatures above\r\nfreezing point.\r\n\r\nThe observations prove also that the inner temperatures vary less than\r\nthe outer, that is that they range within narrower limits. They also\r\nshow that the inner air is but slowly affected by the outer air when\r\nthe latter is above freezing point, the inner temperature rising\r\nthen only gradually. Per contra, when the outside temperature drops\r\nquickly much below freezing point, the inside temperature generally\r\ndrops correspondingly at once, proving that the cold air has sunk by\r\nits weight into the cave. The observations also prove that the old idea\r\nthat the temperature of caves is the same throughout, can no longer\r\nbe considered correct. The observations also appear to show, that the\r\ntemperature of a cave does not necessarily represent the mean annual\r\ntemperature of a surrounding district. Observation is still entirely\r\nlacking on the mean annual temperature of glacières, so that one cannot\r\nspeak definitely about the matter; but it seems likely that the mean\r\nannual temperature of a glacière cave is lower than the isotherm of its\r\nlocality; and it seems more than probable that on the same isotherm\r\ndifferent glacière caves may have different mean annual temperatures,\r\nvarying with the elements of size, quantity of ice, position of body of\r\ncave and of entrance, water supply and other factors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Ice near the Entrance of Caves and the Surface of the Soil._--An\r\nimportant proof that it is the cold air of winter which forms the ice\r\nis the fact that the latter is always found near the entrance of caves\r\nor near the surface of the soil. It never extends far within. To the\r\nbest of my knowledge, ice has never been found two hundred meters from\r\nthe entrance nor at any depth beyond one hundred and fifty meters. In\r\nall caves of great extent, the temperature far in is about the same as\r\nthat of the surrounding rock, and in all deep borings the temperature\r\nincreases with the depth and at great depths the temperature becomes\r\nhigh. This nearness of subterranean ice to the outside air is one of\r\nthe best proofs, that, paradoxical as the whole phenomenon appears at\r\nfirst, yet in reality it is an extremely simple matter.\r\n\r\nThe position of the entrance of a cave in relation to the body of the\r\ncave is an important factor in permitting the cold air to permeate\r\nand remain in the cave. In all the caves or gullies I have examined\r\nmyself, the main mass of ice is well below the level of the entrance,\r\nand even if the latter is sheltered against the wind, it is not\r\nsheltered against the cold air of winter. This is heavy, and by its own\r\nweight sinks well down to the bottom, freezing up in course of time\r\nall the moisture that may drip from the roof, or that may come into\r\nthe cave in the shape of melted snow or cold winter rain. The summer\r\nair, which is warm and, therefore, light, can only enter the cave with\r\ngreat difficulty; and, as a rule, before it dislodges the winter air\r\nand destroys the ice, another winter's freeze reverses once more the\r\nconditions. These principles seem to hold of every known glacière.\r\nIt is true, that at the Frauenmauer, the floor of the cavern rises\r\nsomewhat from the entrance; but the highest point of the floor is still\r\nbelow the level of the top of the entrance, so that the cold air can\r\nflow over the highest point without difficulty. The same appears to be\r\nthe case at the Posselthöhle; while at Amarnath in Kashmere, where the\r\nfloor is said to rise to the back wall, the entrance is about as large\r\nas the area of the floor, so that the ice must also be below the level\r\nof the top of the entrance.\r\n\r\nThe position or situation of the entrance is important. In almost all\r\ncases it has a northerly exposure, and is sheltered against entering\r\nwinds. If these two conditions do not exist the ice supply surely\r\nsuffers. Sometimes the entrance is more or less tortuous. In some cases\r\nit is protected by a fringe of trees. Still, there is no absolute rule\r\nabout entrances. The Friedrichsteinerhöhle faces about due south, and\r\nat midday in summer, the sun shines all the way down to the ice floor,\r\ncausing mists to form. In the Kolowratshöhle, the entrance is badly\r\nsheltered against the wind and this undoubtedly affects the supply in\r\nsummer and causes more rapid melting there than in some other cases.[58]\r\n\r\n[58] See Part III.: Decorah, page 178.\r\n\r\nFreezing boulder taluses invariably have the ice near the surface,\r\nand probably it is never a dozen meters distant from the open air.\r\nThese taluses are one of the strongest links in the chain of evidence\r\nproving the winter's cold theory. The snow and ice on the surface of\r\nthe taluses and on the surface of the boulders in gullies melts away,\r\nwhile it still lingers underneath the boulders. It seems self-evident\r\nthat the melting snow water has run to the lowest level and there\r\ncongealed, and then remained because it was better sheltered than the\r\nice outside.\r\n\r\nThe subsoil ice of the tundras of Siberia and Alaska is almost\r\nidentical with the ice of boulder formations, except that it extends\r\nunder larger areas. It is the product of a climate where there is a\r\nlong, rigorous winter and it is not surprising that the ice is found at\r\ngreater depths than in more southerly latitudes.[59] The depth to which\r\nthe ice extends is, of course, determined by the depth to which the\r\nwinter's cold can penetrate the soil. There is no doubt that the causes\r\nof this ice are local, that is, that it is due to the long prevailing\r\nlow temperatures.\r\n\r\n[59] See Part III.: Alaska, page 166; Klondike, page 167; Kowak River,\r\npage 166; Kotzebue Sound, page 166.\r\n\r\nThe freezing wells of which the most conspicuous examples are at\r\nBrandon, Owego, Decorah, and in Montana, seem also due to local causes\r\nand the ice is never far from the surface, that is, not over twenty\r\nmeters; and apparently also it forms above the water horizons which\r\nsupply the wells.\r\n\r\nThe ice sheet on Mount Etna[60] does not seem to be at any great depth.\r\nIt apparently had a different origin from most subterranean ice masses,\r\nin that the snow probably fell first and was then covered by a flow of\r\nlava. It is, therefore, almost _sui generis_ in its mode of formation,\r\nunless there are similar sheets on other volcanoes, which is probable\r\nin a country like Iceland, and which is said to be the case in Tierra\r\ndel Fuego,[61] But the original cause of the ice sheet on Etna was the\r\nsame as all other subterranean ice masses, namely the cold of winter.\r\n\r\n[60] See Part III., page 210.\r\n\r\n[61] See Part III., page 190.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Evaporation and Movements of Air._--The formation of subterranean ice\r\nis sometimes assigned partly to evaporation or to expansion of the air.\r\nThe theory is an old one, and both scientific and non-scientific men\r\nhave advanced it.[62]\r\n\r\n[62] Among those who have written that evaporation is a factor in the\r\nformation of subterranean ice, may be mentioned: Pictet, 1822; Scrope,\r\n1827; Reich, 1834; Pleischl, 1841; Murchison, 1845; Olmstead, 1856;\r\nHitchcock, 1861; White, 1870; Kirchhoff, 1876; Krauss, 1895.\r\n\r\nI have already said that I believe it is the movements of the air\r\nwhich cause a cave to be a glacière cave or a normal cave. When they\r\nact in such a way as to permit the cold air of winter to permeate a\r\ncave, we find low temperatures and ice; when they do not, we find the\r\ntemperature about the same as that of the ground and no ice.\r\n\r\nThat the ice is not formed in apparently static caves, by movements\r\nof air producing evaporation, seems to me proved by what I have\r\nnoticed in regard to the atmosphere. The dryness or moistness of the\r\nair within a glacière cave is coincident with the state of freezing\r\nor thawing of the cave. When I have visited a large cave in June,\r\neverything was frozen tight, there were no drips nor mushy ice, the\r\nair was relatively dry and the sensation of cold not unpleasant. When\r\nI have visited a cave in August, the ice was soft and mushy, water\r\nwas dripping from the roof, the atmosphere was moist, and the cold\r\npenetrating. It seems to me that the facts go to show that it is not\r\nevaporation which forms the ice, but the melting of the ice which\r\nfills the cave with moisture. If there are any draughts or movements\r\nof the atmosphere when above freezing point, then their tendency is to\r\nvaporize the ice.\r\n\r\nThe process of the formation of ice in relation to the atmosphere is as\r\nfollows: the cold air permeates the cave and freezes up all the drip:\r\nthe atmosphere becomes dry: gradually warmer air gets in and the ice\r\nbegins to melt: then the atmosphere gets charged slowly with the vapor\r\nof the melting ice. This process is the exact opposite of the formation\r\nof ice by evaporation; it is the atmosphere which is made humid by the\r\nvaporizing of the ice, and by the drip. When the air is thoroughly\r\nsaturated with the vapor, being scarcely renewed from outside and but a\r\nfew degrees above freezing point, it undoubtedly retards evaporation,\r\nacts like a blanket and lessens the rate of melting of the ice.[63]\r\n\r\n[63] See Part IV.: Thury, page 285; Fugger, page 296; Trouillet, page\r\n298.\r\n\r\nEverything I have personally observed in freezing windholes shows\r\nthat in them also the cold of winter and not evaporation is the\r\ncause of the ice. They answer to the same tests as other glacières,\r\nof geographical distribution and altitude, nearness of ice to the\r\noutside, thermometric observations, and dampness of the air when the\r\nice melts. Equally with other glacières, the movements of air in\r\nwindholes do not depend on the presence of ice, but the ice does depend\r\non the movements of air and a water supply at the proper time. A proof\r\nthat it is the cold of winter which makes the ice in windholes, is that\r\nthe ice is always found at the lower extremity, for the reason that it\r\nis at that end that the cold air enters and to that end that the water\r\ngravitates. The reason that ice is more rarely found in windholes than\r\nin apparently static caves, is due to the movements of air. Unlike the\r\ncaves where the heavy cold air preserves the ice by remaining pent\r\nup, as soon as the outside temperature rises the heavy cold air in\r\nwindholes tumbles out at the lower opening and is replaced gradually by\r\nair at a higher temperature. This also flows out and when it is above\r\nfreezing point, it naturally melts the ice and becomes humid: in fact,\r\nit vaporizes the ice as it passes, and dissipates the moisture into the\r\nouter air.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, certain, that in caves with a temperature some degrees\r\nabove freezing point, when there is either running water or strong\r\ndrips, evaporation may be, and sometimes undoubtedly is, a factor in\r\nlowering the temperature somewhat.[64] As in some windholes there\r\nis occasionally moisture on the rock surfaces where the air current\r\npasses, the evaporation from these surfaces doubtless lowers the\r\ntemperature of the draughts, and it may be, also those of the rock\r\nsurfaces, a little.\r\n\r\n[64] See Part IV.: De Saussure, page 274. See also _Les Abimes_, 1894,\r\npage 564.\r\n\r\nFurther observations, however, will be necessary in regard to\r\nevaporation underground, as the data are still insufficient to make\r\nabsolutely positive statements.[65] I fail to see any evidence to show\r\nthat evaporation ever lowers the temperature of draughts underground\r\nbelow freezing point, only that it may help to lower them to something\r\nless than they would otherwise be. Taking all the facts which I have\r\nmyself observed, and all I have read of in the reports of others, my\r\nown conclusion is that we have no proof that evaporation underground is\r\never strong enough to produce ice.\r\n\r\n[65] Several observers consider evaporation as more or less of a factor\r\nin the production of cold underground. It is suggested also, that in\r\ncertain cases, at high altitudes, evaporation tends to prevent the\r\nmelting of the ice in windholes, but this is not proved, as yet. See\r\nPart IV.: De Saussure, page 274; Fugger, page 296; Trouillet, page 298;\r\nMartel, page 300; Lohmann, page 302.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Time of Formation of Ice._--Everything I have seen points to the fact\r\nthat ice begins to form in a cave as soon as the temperature of the\r\ncave has sunk below freezing point, whenever, from any cause, water\r\ngets into the cave. The cold may begin to penetrate caves as soon\r\nas outside frosts have occurred, that is in the fall months, about\r\nNovember; and as soon as the temperature inside sinks below freezing\r\npoint, ice will begin to form, provided also that water gets into the\r\ncave, from rains or springs or any other source.\r\n\r\nIn the mid-winter months, although there is then plenty of cold, the\r\nwater supply is generally lacking, as the outside moisture is mostly\r\nfrozen up and the result is that the winter months are not those\r\nwhen the ice is mainly formed. Some is undoubtedly formed in certain\r\ncaves whenever during the course of the winter a surface thaw outside\r\nfurnishes water to the cave,[66] but in other cases this is not so and\r\nthe ice does not appear before the spring. In all cases it is in the\r\nspring, before the cave has parted with its store of cold, and when\r\nboth the air and the rock walls are chilled below freezing point[67]\r\nthat the ice forms fastest. Then plenty of water is furnished by the\r\nmelting of the snows and the unlocking of the brooks, and also by early\r\nspring rains. All this surface water runs through the fissures into\r\nthe still freezing cave and there becomes ice. Not only the air, but\r\nalso the rock walls are chilled below freezing point, and as the rocks\r\npart slowly with the cold stored in them, this cold helps to freeze the\r\nwater pouring in.\r\n\r\n[66] See Part III.: Chaux-les-Passavant, page 203; Saint-Georges, page\r\n220.\r\n\r\n[67] See Part IV.: Townson, page 275; Thury, page 285; Trouillet, page\r\n297; Schwalbe, page 298; Terlanday, page 301; Kovarik, page 307.\r\n\r\nThe natural law in relation to time seems to be this: Ice may be formed\r\nin caves as soon as the outside temperature sinks below freezing point.\r\nIn some caves it forms intermittently all through the cold months\r\nbecause there is a water supply. In other caves it only forms in the\r\nspring, because there is no water supply in the winter months. In all\r\ncases, however, the end of winter is the time when most of the ice is\r\nformed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nLIST OF GLACIÈRES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF GLACIÈRES.[68]\r\n\r\n[68] This list is necessarily incomplete, and only approximately\r\naccurate in many cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\nBuried or Fossil Glaciers, North Greenland. (W. E. Meehan,\r\n_Philadelphia Ledger_, 1896.)--On Robertson's Bay is the plateau of\r\nthe Verhoef Glacier, which is about 1500 meters long and 400 meters\r\nwide, and stands back only a few meters from the edge of the sea. This\r\nplateau, both top and sides, is a mass of flourishing vegetation,\r\nchiefly grass, which reaches above a man's knee. From among this\r\nverdure buttercups, poppies, cinquefoils and dandelions thrust their\r\ngolden heads in wild profusion. Similar buried glaciers are found in\r\nmany places along the fiords of North Greenland.\r\n\r\nMr. Meehan gives a simple explanation in connection with the Verhoef\r\nGlacier. He says that this glacier formerly extended out into the sea,\r\nand that while it moved forward, the clump moss, which struggles for\r\nexistence in Greenland gorges, could do little more than hold its own.\r\nIn course of time, from some unknown cause, the glacier receded to the\r\npoint where it now discharges, the part in the water floating away in\r\nthe shape of icebergs, and the part on the shore remaining stationary.\r\nThis was the opportunity for the clump mosses. Caring nothing for the\r\ncold they crept slowly over the quiet mass of ice and made their way\r\nfirst in thin net-like layers, later in thick masses, till they reached\r\nthe rocky shore. Year after year the mosses grew, the young plants\r\ntrampling underfoot the older; until the latter, rotting, turned into\r\na rich mould. The seeds of grasses and flowers found their way to\r\nthis, blown by the wind or carried on the feet of birds. The plateau\r\nnow is a garden of green, gold and white. How long this will last it\r\nis impossible to say, as any time nature may unloose its hold, and the\r\nfrozen river once more pour down into the bay.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubsoil Ice in Alaska. (I. C. Russell, _A Journey up the Yukon\r\nRiver_, page 149, and _Second Expedition to Mount Saint Elias_, page\r\n19.)--Professor Russell found ice covered by rocks and vegetation\r\nin several places in Alaska, especially along the southern edge of\r\nthe Malaspina Glacier and on the Yukon River. He gives the following\r\ninteresting account in 1890 of these ice sheets: \"Throughout the length\r\nof the Yukon, one is frequently reminded of the high latitude drained\r\nby the great river, by seeing strata of ice in the recently cut banks,\r\nbeneath the dense layer of moss and roots forming the surface on which\r\nthe forests grow. One may frequently find ice even on a hot summer's\r\nday, by scraping away the moss at his feet. In some instances the\r\nfrozen layer has been penetrated to the depth of twenty-five feet, but\r\nits full depth has never been ascertained. In the banks of some of the\r\nstreams to the north of the lower Yukon, strata of ice over a hundred\r\nfeet thick have been observed, and the indications are that its total\r\ndepth is considerably greater than the portion exposed. This subsoil\r\nice is stagnant and without the characteristics of glaciers.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSubsoil Ice in the Klondike Region. (_Philadelphia Ledger_, December\r\n30th, 1897.)--The Klondike mining country is covered with snow most of\r\nthe year. The ground is frozen for ten or twelve meters in depth, down\r\nto bed rock. In some places the ground, which is protected by a thick\r\nmoss, is not thawed out by the sun in summer. The miner cuts off the\r\nmoss with a shovel, and then builds a fire, which thaws out the ground\r\nfor five or ten centimeters. He digs this out, rebuilds a fire, and\r\nthen continues this process.\r\n\r\n\r\nIce Cliffs on the Kowak River, Alaska. (Lieutenant J. C. Cantwell,\r\n_National Geographic Magazine_, October, 1896.)--On the shores of the\r\nKowak River are a series of ice cliffs of from about 25 meters to\r\n45 meters in height. On top of these ice cliffs is a layer of black\r\nsilt-like soil some 2 meters in thickness, and from this springs a\r\nluxuriant growth of mosses, grass and Arctic shrubbery. The melted ice\r\nshows a residuum of fine dust, which while fresh emits a pungent odor.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubterranean Ice Sheet on Kotzebue Sound. (Otto von Kotzebue,\r\n_Entdeckungsreise in die Südsee_, etc. Weimar, 1821. Vol. IV., page\r\n140.)--Dr. Eschholz discovered near Kotzebue Sound, in 1816, a mass of\r\nice more than 30 meters thick, and entirely covered with a layer at\r\nleast 15 centimeters thick of clay, sand, and earth, on which heavy,\r\nlong grass was growing. In the ice and in the soil overlaying it, were\r\nmany remains of extinct animals. On the side towards the ocean the ice\r\nwas entirely bare, exposed to sun and air, and much of it was melting\r\naway in streamlets.\r\n\r\n\r\nFreezing Lava Caves, Washington. (R. W. Raymond, _Overland Monthly_, 3d\r\nNovember, 1869, page 421. Th. Kirchhoff, _Reisebilder und Skizzen aus\r\nAmerica_, 1876, vol. II., page 211. _Philadelphia Ledger_, September\r\n25th, 1899.)--These caves are distant about four hours from the foot of\r\nMount Adams, and about 56 kilometers from the mouth of the White Salmon\r\nRiver, where it falls into the Columbia River. The caves are in basalt,\r\nand they are connected at both ends with the open air. Only a few of\r\nthem contain any ice, which in the largest cave is about 6 meters below\r\nthe entrance, from which one descends by a ladder. The cave opens on\r\none side and is some 15 meters in depth, 6 meters or 8 meters in width\r\nand 3 meters or 4 meters in height. This part contains the most ice.\r\nThe other side gradually narrows from the entrance, is longer, and\r\nreaches out through fallen rocks and rubbish to daylight. In the lower\r\nportion, there are a few ice stalactites and stalagmites: one a superb,\r\ntransparent hillock, which rises nearly to the roof, is called the\r\nIceberg. A strong draught flows into the cave in summer through the\r\nopen arm.\r\n\r\nThe following paragraphs from the _Philadelphia Ledger_ probably refer\r\nto the same locality:--\r\n\r\n\"Ice for the cutting, and that in August and early in September, is a\r\nnovelty not often found in regions as far south as the Columbia River\r\nbasin; but the novelty is enjoyed every year by people who visit the\r\nice caves under the shadow of Mount Adams, about 100 miles northeast\r\nof Portland. It is a very extensive region. Frank McFarland, who has\r\njust returned from a six weeks' vacation camping trip there, gives an\r\ninteresting account of its general make up.\r\n\r\n\"At the ice caves, which are six miles from Trout Lake, the stalactites\r\nare more beautiful and wonderful this year than ever before, and this\r\nwas Mr. McFarland's fifteenth trip there. He broke off and took to camp\r\nchunks of ice weighing 100 pounds. Pleasure parties who come to the\r\nlake use considerable of the ice for packing their trout to take home.\r\nAll you have to do is to take a torch of pitch pine or a lantern, and\r\ngo into the big caves and pack off all the ice you want. It is a sure\r\ncrop, and never fails.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIce Spring in the Rocky Mountains, Oregon. (G. Gibbs, _American Journal\r\nof Science and Arts_, 1853, Second Series, vol. XV., page 146.)--The\r\nIce Spring is about 60 kilometers from the South Pass to the right of\r\nthe Sweetwater River. It is situated in a low marshy swale, where the\r\nground is filled with springs; and about 60 centimeters below the turf\r\nis a sheet of horizontal ice, some 10 centimeters to 30 centimeters\r\nthick, lasting throughout the year. The ice is clear and is disposed\r\nin hexagonal prisms; it has a slightly saline taste, the ground above\r\nit being impregnated with salt and the water near by tasting of sulphur.\r\n\r\n\r\nFreezing Lava Caves in Modoc County, California. (_Dispatch_,\r\nFrankford, Pennsylvania, 22d January, 1897, reprinted from another\r\npaper.)--The lava beds, where the Modoc Indians made their last stand\r\nagainst the United States troops, are described as an immense field of\r\nlava covered with a beautiful forest of conifers. Numerous caves of\r\nvarying shapes and dimensions are scattered throughout these lava beds.\r\nSome are mere covert ways, with an arch of stone thrown over them;\r\nothers are immense chambers some meters from the surface; another kind\r\nsinks deeply and may be in a series of chambers united by a corridor\r\nthat opens at the surface; while another kind seems to go directly to\r\nthe centre of the earth without stopping. Some of these caves contain\r\nice and from them the Modocs drew their water supply while besieged by\r\nthe troops. Judging from what is reported of the caves the quantity of\r\nice in them must be large. The thermometer in winter in the region is\r\nsaid to go as low as -30° C.\r\n\r\n\r\nFreezing Lava Beds near Medicine Lake, Siskiyou County, Northern\r\nCalifornia. (M. S. Baker, _Sierra Club Bulletin_, 1899. Vol. II., page\r\n318.)--\"One other feature of the lava region must be mentioned--the ice\r\ncaves. There are several of these known, and very likely many more\r\nremain undiscovered. Those located along the edge of the lava, near the\r\ncinder cone, I have known to contain ice and water as late as August.\r\nThe largest I have seen is on the Mayfield Road, about twenty miles\r\neast of Bartles. It is situated in the barren lava, and in one of the\r\nwarmest localities of the region,--and there are few cool spots in the\r\nlava anywhere. One enters the cave by crawling down a hole none too\r\nlarge. The instant the interior is reached the temperature falls in a\r\nsurprising way. Not more than ten feet below the surface of the hot\r\nrocks is a bed of ice, covered by a foot or so of ice water. The body\r\nof ice was perhaps twelve or fifteen feet long, by five feet across\r\nin the widest places. This cave is formed by a fissure that extends a\r\ndistance of twenty miles from the ice cave to Pittville, and nearly\r\ncoincides with the 4000 foot level, as shown in the map. Along the\r\nsoutheastern half of this earth fissure the southwest wall has faulted,\r\nleaving a cliff, which, in places, must be nearly 200 feet high.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFreezing Shafts, Montana.--Mr. Robert Butler, of San José, Cal., has\r\ngiven me much information about glacières in Montana. He visited one\r\nminers' shaft which is situated about 80 kilometers up the Rosebud\r\nRiver from Rosebud Station on the Northern Pacific R. R., and about 10\r\nkilometers northeast of the Cheyenne Indian Agency. It is on the north\r\nslope of the Little Wolf Mountains, near the summit, at the head of\r\nGreenleaf Creek. The canyon and surrounding slopes are covered with\r\na dense growth of pine. The rock has the appearance of scoriæ caused\r\nby the burning of immense beds of coal in recent geological times. The\r\nrock is broken into comparatively small pieces. The altitude is some\r\n1200 meters. The forest, the volcanic ash and the altitude, besides\r\nthe loose rock formation, makes this place a natural ice house. Ten or\r\ntwelve years ago three prospectors, looking for silver, sunk a shaft\r\nhere. At a depth of about 4 meters it began to grow cold, and at 6\r\nmeters they found ice and imagined they could feel an upward draught.\r\nBeing ignorant and superstitious, they became frightened and abandoned\r\nthe shaft. During the winter, the snow fills the shaft half full of\r\nice, which then remains over through the summer. There is a general\r\nreport and belief among those who have visited the well, that it\r\nfreezes in summer and thaws in winter. There are thousands of mining\r\nshafts in Montana, and if they are on the north slope of a mountain\r\nof considerable altitude and under a dense forest and not too deep,\r\nthey generally have ice at the bottom during the summer. It is also\r\nsaid to be nothing new for a miner in following crevices to find them\r\nfilled with ice, especially if near the surface on the north slope of a\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\n\r\nFreezing Cave, Fergus County, Montana.--Mr. Robert Butler, of San José,\r\nCal., visited this place, which is about 35 kilometers southeast of\r\nLewistown. It is on the north side of a butte. Masses of ice and great\r\nicicles form in some parts of the cave in such quantities during the\r\nlatter part of winter that the cave furnishes ice for cooling the\r\ndrinking water for several dozen families. During July and August the\r\npeople come from some distance around to get the ice. The people in the\r\nneighborhood believe that the ice forms in summer and thaws away in\r\nwinter. They also speak of the ever upward draught of cold air coming\r\npossibly from some great hidden cavern in the lower recesses of the\r\nmountain.\r\n\r\n\r\nFreezing Well at Horse Plains, Montana. (Levi Allen, _Scientific\r\nAmerican_. New Series, 27th October, 1883.)--The well is described as\r\n13.60 meters deep. It is dug through solid gravel, and in sinking it\r\nthere was encountered, at a depth of 10.60 meters, a current of air\r\nstrong enough to blow out a candle. It began to freeze in September,\r\n1882, and in November it was frozen solid.\r\n\r\n\r\nFreezing Silver Mine, Bighorn County, Wyoming.--This place is in the\r\nSunlight Basin of the Shoshone Mountains. Mr. William Worrell Wagner,\r\nof Philadelphia, informs me that he visited it in August, 1897. It is\r\na silver mine or tunnel, running straight into the mountain for about\r\n60 meters, at an altitude of about 3300 meters. The peaks of the Teton\r\nrange were in sight from the mouth of the tunnel. For the first half of\r\nthe way in, a good many icicles were hanging from the rocks. The last\r\nhalf of the tunnel was thickly coated with ice and looked like a cold\r\nstorage plant. Snow disappears on the rocks outside about June, and\r\nbegins to fall again in September, so that Mr. Wagner's visit was at\r\nabout the hottest time of the year. Mr. Wagner presented the meat of a\r\nbull wapiti he had shot to the miners, and they stored it in the mine\r\nas if it had been an artificial refrigerator.\r\n\r\n\r\nRifts of Ice, Mount McClellan, Colorado. (Edward L. Berthoud, _American\r\nJournal of Science and Arts_. Third Series, 1876, vol. XI., page\r\n108.)--Near the summit of Mount McClellan, is the Centennial Lode,\r\nwhich runs into the mountain, at an altitude of about 3900 meters.\r\nIntercalated in the mineral vein are three or four well defined veins\r\nof solid ice parallel with the bedding of the rock and filling all its\r\ninner side-cracks and fissures. The same frozen substratum is found in\r\ntwo other lodes near by on the same mountain. Nothing of the kind is\r\nknown on other Colorado mountains. The soil is loose and largely made\r\nup of rocky débris, which shows that the ice is probably due to local\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\n\r\nFreezing Tunnel on the Hagerman Pass, Colorado. (_Philadelphia Press_,\r\nOctober 16th, 1897.)--The Hagerman Pass Railroad line is said to\r\nhave been abandoned after the completion of the Busk-Ivanhoe tunnel,\r\nbut to have been rebuilt. The Hagerman tunnel for a distance of over\r\n700 meters was filled with solid ice, and it required blasting with\r\ndynamite, and a month's continuous labor, day and night, to dig the ice\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\nFreezing Cavern in Cow Mountain, Colorado. (_Post Dispatch_, St. Louis,\r\nMo., July 13th, 1897, and September 5th, 1897. _Mail Order Monthly_,\r\nSt. Paul, Minn., October, 1899.)--The cave was discovered by parties\r\ndoing assessment work on a group of claims. A man was picking in a\r\nthree meter hole when he struck his pick into an opening, which was\r\ngradually enlarged and showed a deep pit underneath. The men got a rope\r\nand descended into an immense cavern full of ice. Later exploration\r\nled to a small hall, some 5 meters in diameter, full of icicles. From\r\nhere a fissure led into a second rock chamber larger than the first. A\r\nsmall hole in the floor at an angle of some 45° gave access to a third\r\nand larger hall, about 25 meters by 40 meters. Great masses of ice were\r\nfound in this, also a small lake, about 12 meters by 20 meters. \"Some\r\nwho have visited the wonderful discovery are of the opinion that it\r\nis a great cave or fissure in a glacier which for centuries has been\r\nslowly making its way down from Pike's Peak and whose waters are now\r\nfeeding the Arkansas River.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWindhole, Arizona. (_Christian Herald_, March 24th, 1897.)--Mr. Cofman,\r\nwhile drilling a well on his place, is said to have opened a windhole\r\nfrom which the escaping air current was strong enough to blow off the\r\nhats of the men who were recovering the lost drill. Some days the air\r\nescapes with such force that pebbles the size of peas are thrown up,\r\naccompanied by a sound much like the distant bellowing of a fog horn.\r\nAgain for days there will be a suction current, unaccompanied by\r\nsound, in which the current of air passes into the earth with somewhat\r\nless force than when escaping, and any light object, as a feather or a\r\npiece of paper, will be immediately sucked in. The account is probably\r\nexaggerated.\r\n\r\n\r\nFreezing Lava Cave near Flagstaff, Arizona.--Professor W. B. Scott of\r\nPrinceton University told me of this cave, which he had not visited\r\nhimself. It lies 14.5 kilometers south of Flagstaff, on the Mesa\r\ntable land, at an altitude of about 2000 meters. It was described to\r\nProfessor Scott as a double cave, with two floors, one over the other,\r\nthe lower containing the most ice. It is in lava, and can only be\r\nentered by crawling in on hands and knees.\r\n\r\n\r\nFreezing Cave or Gorge, White Mountains, Arizona.--Mr. Frank Hamilton\r\nCushing has told me of this place. It is a cleft among lava rock, which\r\nbeing roofed at the further end, might be described as a cave. In this\r\nthe ice remains until June or July, much later than anywhere else in\r\nthe neighborhood. The Zuni Indians worship before this, calling the\r\nice the breath of the Gods, the snow they consider as a sort of down.\r\nThe region is arid, which makes any water precious, and this fact has\r\ndeveloped the element of mysticism about snow and ice among the Indians.\r\n\r\n\r\nFreezing Cave near Galena, Black Hills, South Dakota. (Miss L. A.\r\nOwen, _Cave Regions of the Ozarks and Black Hills_. Cincinnati, 1898,\r\npage 209): \"At Galena, a new mining town of golden promise, there is\r\nreported to be an Ice Cave, where ice forms at all seasons, and during\r\nthe warm weather is a source of comfort and pleasure to the miners.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWindholes in the Ozark Mountains, Missouri.--Mr. H. F. Brinckerhoff,\r\nof Aurora, Mo., informs me that there are a number of cold air current\r\ncaves in the Ozark Mountain region. One of them is some 19 kilometers\r\nsouth of Aurora, Lawrence County, and is used for cold storage in\r\nsummer. There is a cave in a limestone bluff about 15 meters above a\r\nriver, and in the rear is this windhole, which is an opening about 30\r\ncentimeters high and 3 meters wide. A strong current of air comes out\r\nfrom it in summer, and the hotter the air outside, the stronger is the\r\noutward coming current. In winter the current is reversed. The outward\r\ncurrent is so strong in very hot weather that a handkerchief held in it\r\nis straightened out to an angle of about 45°.\r\n\r\n\r\nFreezing Cave and Well at Decorah, Iowa. Described in Part I. (Dr. C.\r\nA. White, _Report of Geological Survey of State of Iowa_, 1870, vol.\r\nI., page 80. A. F. Kovarik, _Scientific American Supplement_, No. 1195,\r\nNovember 26th, 1898, pages 19,158, 19,159).\r\n\r\nOn June 1st, 1869, Dr. White found the ice dry and well frozen, and he\r\nthought it was then accumulating. The cave was cool and apparently dry,\r\nand no strong air current was passing through.\r\n\r\nMr. Alois F. Kovarik, of the Decorah Institute, has made a valuable\r\nseries of observations about the Decorah Cave. The temperatures he\r\nobserved were the following:\r\n\r\n                    IN THE VALLEY,              LOCUS\r\n                       SHADE.      DIVISION.  GLACIALIS.

At the entrance the breeze\r\nwas strong enough to blow out a candle. This breeze was not noticed at\r\nother times. From December to February inclusive, on the contrary, the\r\nbreeze was reversed. From July to October, 1897, the walls of the cave\r\nwere moist. From October to February they were dry. In February frost\r\nbegan to appear on the walls. On March 12th, 1898, the walls were\r\ncovered with frost. The ice appeared at a spot nearly at the end of the\r\ncave on the 26th of March, 1898. At a place about 6.50 meters nearer\r\nthe entrance, however, is where most ice forms. This place Mr. Kovarik\r\ncalls _Locus Glacialis_. The ice appeared here about the 29th of May,\r\n1898. It increased rapidly up to June 12th, when it was at its maximum,\r\nand was about two meters in width. It generally covers the north wall\r\nfrom top to base. The greatest thickness in 1898 was 29 centimeters.\r\n\r\nThe temperature which Mr. Kovarik recorded on the 16th of April at\r\n_Locus Glacialis_ of +1.1 seems an anomalous one. On writing to him\r\nhe sent me the following explanation: \"April 16th, after I left the\r\nthermometer at _Locus Glacialis_ the usual time, I noticed that it\r\nregistered +1.1° C. It seemed singular, for at both the Division and\r\nthe End, the thermometer registered considerably lower. I left the\r\nthermometer at its place for about an hour longer, and noticed then\r\nthat it did not register differently. I would suggest this explanation:\r\nThis is true about water that upon freezing it gives off its latent\r\nheat. Now on April 16th some water dripped into the cave on the wall\r\nnear where the thermometer was, about 1.50 meters from the floor. The\r\namount of water was very small, but as it came in contact with the cold\r\nwall it began to give out its latent heat which affected the close by\r\nthermometer. The temperature of the rock was without doubt between -1.°\r\nand -3°.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFreezing Cavern at Brainard, Iowa. (Alois F. Kovarik, _Decorah Public\r\nOpinion_, September 20th, 1899.)--This little cave is situated on the\r\nnorth side of a hill about 1.5 kilometers northwest of Brainard. It is\r\nabout 4.50 meters deep. On June 10th, 1899, Mr. Kovarik found the floor\r\nand walls covered with ice. The temperature was 0° C. The owner claims\r\nto have taken enough ice out of it on July 4th, 1897, to freeze cream.\r\n\r\n\r\nFreezing Cave near Elkinsville, Brown County, Indiana. (Clipping from\r\na western newspaper, 1896.)--The entrance is said to be overlapped by\r\ntrees and to resemble a mine shaft. The winding way leads to a hollow\r\nsome 15 meters below the surface, resembling a broad vaulted corridor,\r\nwhich is known to the natives as the devil's chamber and where the\r\ntemperature is low. From this point several galleries lead further in,\r\nand from one of them comes a blast of icy cold air. This passage is\r\nsimilar to the one at the entrance to the cave, but after a few meters\r\nfrost is visible, and further on it is thick on all sides, like the\r\ncrust that is formed on the pipes of an ice plant. The narrow way leads\r\nto a big chamber, known as the ice vault. In this dome, which is fully\r\n30 meters in width, the ice forms a large stalagmite and is of unknown\r\ndepth.\r\n\r\n\r\nFreezing Gully on Mount Abraham, Maine.

The ice is found in a narrow defile\r\nof perpendicular trap rock, at the bottom filled with broken stones.\r\nThe defile is so placed that in summer the sun only shines into it for\r\nabout an hour each day; it is also well protected by surrounding trees,\r\nthe leaves from which form beds at the bottom among the rocks and help\r\nto protect the ice.\r\n\r\n\r\nNatural Ice House of Northford, Connecticut. (Benjamin Silliman,\r\n_American Journal of Science and Arts_, 1822, vol. IV., page\r\n177.)--About 11 kilometers from New Haven on the Middletown road\r\nbetween Branford and Northford, is a gorge where ice remains throughout\r\nthe year. In this case the ice is mixed with a considerable quantity of\r\nleaves and dirt; it has sometimes been brought to New Haven.\r\n\r\n\r\nIce in an Old Iron Mine, near Port Henry, Lake Champlain. (_Geology of\r\nVermont_, 1861, vol. I., page 199.)--Ice was found during the summer at\r\na depth of from 15 meters to 30 meters, and a current of cold air was\r\nissuing from the opening.

Macomber, _American Journal of Arts and Sciences_, 1839, vol.\r\nXXXVI., page 184. _Well's Annual of Scientific Discovery_, 1856, page\r\n190.)--The thermometer is said to have stood at--1.2° at the bottom of\r\nthe biggest well when it registered--20° outside. When a candle was\r\nlet down, the flame became agitated and was thrown in one direction\r\nat the depth of 9 meters; at the bottom the flame was still, but soon\r\ndied out. Large masses of ice were found in the biggest well as late\r\nas July, and the men who made the well were forced to put on thick\r\nclothing in June, and even so could not work for more than two hours at\r\na time.\r\n\r\n\r\nCave in the Panama Rocks, Chautauqua, New York. The Rev. Horace C.\r\nHovey informs me that he has been in a small cave in this locality, and\r\nthat he found ice in it.\r\n\r\n\r\nCave in Sussex County, New Jersey.--A clipping from a newspaper, with\r\nneither name nor date, says that new ice is found daily on the land of\r\nPeter Feather, in the mouth of an unexplored cavern. A small stream of\r\nwater runs out of the cavern and forms a pool at the opening, and here\r\nit is that the ice forms. Enough has been taken in one day to freeze\r\ntwo cans of ice cream. A cold draught of air issues continuously from\r\nthe cavern.\r\n\r\n\r\nHole Containing Ice on Blue Mountain, New Jersey. Reported; no\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n\r\nGorge Containing Ice on Bald Eagle Mountain, Clinton County,\r\nPennsylvania.--Mr. Henry Chapman Mercer, of Doylestown, learned of\r\nthe existence of this gorge during the summer of 1897. It is near the\r\nvillage of McElhatten, in the neighborhood of Lock Haven, and is some\r\n3 kilometers distant from the Susquehanna River.

The ice was\r\nunder rocks, in what may be described as limestone sinks. Since the\r\ndestruction of the forest, the ice has become less abundant, if indeed\r\nany still forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlacières in Abandoned Coal Mines near Summit, Carbon County,\r\nPennsylvania.--Described in Part I., page 95.\r\n\r\n\r\nIce Cave Railroad Station, Luzerne County, Pennsylvania. On the Bowman\r\nCreek branch of the Lehigh Valley R. R.--Mr. F. Holschuh, agent at\r\nLuzerne, informs me that about 2 kilometers from Ice Cave Station is a\r\nlittle waterfall on the side of a mountain which was formerly covered\r\nwith dense forest. A short distance below the fall, a large hollow\r\nplace has been worn out of the rocks by the action of the water. The\r\noverhanging rocks give this almost the appearance of a cave. While\r\nthe forest was still thick and when the winter was cold, ice would\r\nform under these rocks and would not disappear until summer was well\r\nadvanced. The station was called Ice Cave on account of this place.\r\n\r\n\r\nHole Containing Ice at Millerstown, Pennsylvania.--Reported; no\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFreezing Talus at Spruce Creek, Huntingdon County, Pennsylvania.\r\nDescribed in Part I., page 90. The _Philadelphia Ledger_ of July 6th,\r\n1896, states that around the boulders where the ice lies, there are\r\nfound varieties of plants strongly arctic in character.\r\n\r\n\r\nIce Mountain, Hampshire County, Virginia. (C. B. Hayden, _American\r\nJournal of Science and Arts_, 1843, vol. XLV., page 78.)--It lies on\r\nthe North River, near the road leading from Winchester to Romney, at\r\nan altitude of from about 220 meters to 240 meters. One side of the\r\nhill is entirely composed of loose stones, among which an abundance\r\nof ice is found at all times, although the sun shines on the upper\r\nsurface of the stones from ten in the morning until sunset. The ice is\r\nregularly used in summer by the people near by. Constant and strong air\r\ncurrents issue from the crevices in the rocks. Similar, but smaller\r\naccumulations, are said to occur in the same county. Mrs. George B.\r\nBalch visited the Ice Mountain in August, 1878. She saw no ice, but the\r\nair under the stones was very cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nBlowing Cave, Bath County, Virginia.--Mrs. Horace Jayne informs me that\r\nthere is a blowing cave near the Cowpasture River, about half way on\r\nthe old stage road between Millboro and Warm Springs. A draught flows\r\nout from it, strong enough to blow the grass about, three or four\r\nmeters away. The draught is cold, perhaps abnormally so. The cave has\r\nnot yet been explored.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH AMERICA.\r\n\r\nIce Sheets on Mount Chimborazo. (A. von Humboldt, _Travels to\r\nthe Equinoctial Regions_, London, 1814, vol.

Piazzi Smyth,\r\n_Teneriffe, an Astronomer's Experiment_, 1858, page 348.)--La Cueva de\r\nla Nieve lies at an altitude of 3267 meters in the Malpays on the Peak\r\nof Teneriffe, just below the snow line. It is in obsidian. The entrance\r\nis 3.6 meters high and 2.7 meters broad. The grotto is 36 meters long,\r\n6 meters wide, and 4 meters high. The descent into the cave is so steep\r\nthat it is necessary to be lowered by ropes. Professor Smyth found in\r\nJuly an ice floor about 60 centimeters thick which was covered with\r\nwater. A good deal of snow was lying near the mouth of the cave. The\r\nwalls were covered with ice and icicles and a few small ice cones rose\r\non the ice floor.\r\n\r\n\r\nICELAND.\r\n\r\nThe Surtshellir or Cave of Surtur.

Henderson, _Iceland_, 1819, 2d ed., page 420.\r\nGuimard, _Voyage en Islande_, page 481.)--The Surtshellir lies in the\r\nvolcanic waste of Westisland, and is in lava which has flowed from the\r\nBald Jokul. The approach is through an open chasm. The length of the\r\ncave is 1534 meters, with an average width of from 15 meters to 17\r\nmeters, and a nearly uniform height of from 9 meters to 11 meters. In\r\nfour places the roof is broken and allows daylight to enter. A great\r\ndeal of ice is sometimes found in the cave, in the shape of an ice\r\nfloor, transparent icy pillars, hanging icy pendants, and columns and\r\narches of ice along the walls. Some of the pillars have been found 2.50\r\nmeters high.\r\n\r\n\r\nKutlagaya. (A.

Girardot, _Mémoires de la Société\r\nd'Émulation du Doubs, 1886_.)\r\n\r\nThe earliest notice of a glacière which I have been able to find is in\r\nthe shape of a letter giving an account of a visit to the Glacière de\r\nChaux-les-Passavant in 1584, by Benigne Poissenot, a French lawyer.\r\nThe account, which I have translated as literally as possible, is in a\r\nspecial chapter, as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"Sir:--Since our separation, I have had this pleasure (_heut_) to\r\nhear news of you only once, having found your brother in Paris; who,\r\nhaving assured me of your good health (_disposition_), informed me of\r\nhow since we had seen each other you had travelled to Italy, even as\r\nfar as Greece, of which you had seen a large portion: and that sound\r\nand safe, after so long a journey, you had reappeared and landed at\r\nHavre de Grace where you wished to go, that is to say at home. All the\r\npleasure which a friend can receive, knowing the affairs of another\r\nself, joined to such a happy result, seized my heart, at the recital\r\nof such agreeable news: and I did not fail shortly after, to write you\r\namply all which had happened to me since I left you until my return to\r\nFrance: congratulating you at having escaped from marine abysses and\r\nperilous passages on land, on which travellers are often constrained\r\nto risk their life. From this time, I have always stayed in Paris or\r\nin the neighborhood, according to the good pleasure of dame fortune,\r\nwho ruled me in her wise and fed me with her dishes the most common\r\nand ordinary until the first day of January of the year 1584, when I\r\nreceived my first gift in the shape of a strong and violent disease,\r\nwhich tormented me more than a month: from which, having become cured\r\nwith the help of God, and having with time recovered my health and my\r\nstrength at the arrival of spring, I was seized with the desire to\r\nsmell the air of the country. And in fact having thrown away my pen\r\nand travelled about (_battu l'estrade_) through high and low Burgundy,\r\nI stopped at Bezenson, Imperial City, to spend the summer. This city\r\nis still to day just the same as Julius Cæsar describes it, in the\r\nnotable mention he makes of it, in the first book of his commentaries\r\nof the war in Gaul, there remaining there all the vestiges of the\r\nmost remarkable things, which he tells of in his description. There\r\nare also very fine fountains, from all of which water streams from\r\nthe representation of some god of antiquity, as a Neptune, a Bacchus,\r\na Pan, a Nereide or others: except before the state house, where the\r\nstatue of Charles the Fifth, representing him in a most natural manner,\r\nis placed on an eagle, which from its beak, pours out such a great\r\nquantity of water that this is the most beautiful, among all the other\r\nfountains. And as I do not doubt that while traversing Italy, you both\r\nsaw and examined with curiosity the most handsome singularities, which\r\npresented themselves to your eyes and that on your return, passing\r\nthrough Avignon and Dauphiné, as your brother informed me, you had\r\nthe advantage over me of seeing the wonders of the country, of which\r\nyou had heard me speak sometimes, regretting that the war, during the\r\ntime I was in that quarter, had prevented my going to the spot, to see\r\nthe burning fountain as in Dodone, and the fountain called Jupiter,\r\nwhich torches of fire light up and which grows less till midday and\r\nthen grows till midnight, and then diminishes and fails at midday:\r\nand another in Epirus which we call to day Albania, the tower without\r\nvenom and the inaccessible mountain: then as I said, since you have\r\ncontemplated these things and several others not less admirable, I\r\nwish to entertain you about a marvel which I saw, during my sojourn\r\nin Bezenson, to know from you, whether in all your journey, you saw\r\na similar thing. Know then that the day of the festival of St. John\r\nBaptist, a young man, provided with an honest knowledge, with whom I\r\nhad made some little acquaintance, presented me with an icicle, to\r\ncool my wine at dinner, and which I admired greatly, on account of the\r\ntime of the year in which we then were, begging him who gave it to me\r\nto tell me where he had discovered this rare present for that time. He\r\nanswered me that every year, the day of the solemnity of the festival\r\nof St. John Baptist, the inhabitants of a village, which he named, were\r\nbound to come to offer the great church of St. John of Bezenson, a\r\ngoodly quantity of ice, which they got in a wood, and brought to town\r\nat night on horses, for fear that by day it should melt, and that one\r\nof his cronies had given to him what he had given to me.\r\n\r\n\"Suddenly there flamed up in me a desire to see this place, where\r\nin the height of the summer, ice was to be found. When he who had\r\npresented me with the icicle saw this, he promised to accompany me, not\r\nhaving as yet, any more than myself, seen this marvel. I did not hatch\r\nvery long this decision, all the more as all those, to whom I mentioned\r\nit, encouraged me to carry it out as soon as I could, assuring me that\r\nI should see a strange thing, and that even the Duke of Alva on his\r\nreturn from Flanders, passing through Franche Comté, had wished to\r\nsee this novelty. Therefore calling on the promise of the one who was\r\nthe cause of undertaking this journey, we went together to Versey, a\r\nfine town, distant five leagues from Bezenson, turning a little off\r\nour direct route, to go to see a literary man, at this said Versey,\r\nwho having called on me at Bezenson, had extracted from me the promise\r\nof going to see him. There happened to me in this spot, what the poet\r\ndu Bellay says happened to him, on his return from Italy, passing\r\nthrough the Grisons, to go into France: who, after having chanted the\r\ntroubles there are in the passage, says that the Swiss made him drink\r\nso much, that he does not remember anything he saw in that country.\r\nLikewise, I can assure you that my host, following the custom of those\r\nof the country (who do not think they are treating a man properly if\r\nthey do not make him drink a lot, taking that from the Germans, their\r\nneighbors) made us carouse so well, that when we went to bed, we were\r\nvery gay boys. For although we had both made an agreement on the road,\r\nyet our host knew so well how to win us over, saying that those who\r\nwould not drink, gave reason to think badly of them, and that they had\r\ncommitted, or wished to commit some great crime, which they feared to\r\ngive away in drinking, that in the end we let ourselves go, passing\r\nthe time in Pantagruelic fashion. The next morning having taken some\r\n\"hair from the beast\" and a guide which our host gave to us to conduct\r\nus to the _Froidiere_--we continued our wanderings, and arrived at a\r\nlittle village called Chaud, joining a large wood, where our guide told\r\nus, that although he had been more than six times to the _Froidiere_,\r\nyet the road was so tortuous and so cut up by small paths, that if we\r\ndid not take a man from this village, to be more sure, we might spend\r\nmore than half a day in the wood, before finding what we were seeking.\r\nGetting off our horses now, we added to our company a native of the\r\nplace, who having led us by crooked roads, about a quarter of a league,\r\nthrough the forest, made us enter into a close thicket and by a little\r\npath led us to a pleasant meadow; where, looking down, we saw a hole,\r\nof difficult descent, at the bottom of which was the opening of a\r\ngrotto, pretty big, and so awful and terrifying to see, that one would\r\nhave said, it was the mouth of Hell. And in truth, I remembered then,\r\nthe hole of St. Patrick, which is said to be in Hibernia. We were not\r\nbrave enough knights, to try the adventure, my companion and I, if our\r\nguides had not taken the lead. After whom we descended as magnanimously\r\nas the Trojan Duke followed the Sybil to the Plutonic realms, the sword\r\nhalf drawn from the scabbard, and well determined to make test of the\r\nPlatonic doctrine, which teaches that demons can be dissected, in case\r\nany shade or spook should have come to meet us. About the middle of\r\nthe way, we began to feel in descending a very agreeable freshness;\r\nfor it was the second day of July and the sun shone very warmly, which\r\nmade us sweat drop by drop. But we had good opportunity to refresh\r\nourselves and put ourselves to cool, having reached the grotto which\r\nwe found of the length and breadth of a large hall, all paved with ice\r\nin the bottom, and where a crystalline water, colder than that of the\r\nmountains of Arcadia Nonacris, streamed from many small brooklets,\r\nwhich formed very clear fountains, with the water of which I washed\r\nmyself and drank so eagerly, that I had wished the thirst of Tantalus,\r\nor else that I had been bitten by a Dipsas, in order to be always\r\nthirsty, amid such a pleasant beverage. A great lord, who in some\r\npleasure resort, should have such a refrigerator in summer, could boast\r\naccording to my judgment, to be better provided with drink, than the\r\nkings of Persia were with their river Coaspis, which engulphs itself\r\ninto the Tigris, the water whereof was so sweet, that the use of it\r\nwas allowed only to the great King, for the retinue and cronies of his\r\nhousehold. Do not think, that among these delights, I was at all free\r\nfrom fear, for never did I raise my eyes above that from terror my\r\nwhole body shivered and the hair stood up on my head, seeing the whole\r\nroof of the grotto, covered with big massive icicles, the least of\r\nwhich, falling on me, had been sufficient to scramble up my brains and\r\nknock me to pieces; so much so that I was like to that criminal, whom\r\nthey say is punished in Hell, by the continual fear of a big stone,\r\nwhich seems as though it must suddenly fall on his ears. There are\r\nbesides the large hall of the grotto, some rather roomy corners, where\r\nthe gentlemen of the neighborhood, put their venison to cool in summer,\r\nand we saw the hooks, where they hang the wild fowl. It is true, that\r\nwhen we were there, we saw neither game nor wild fowl, and I think,\r\nthat if we had found any of it, we were men to carry off some of it.\r\nWe walked around for about a quarter of an hour, in this _Froidiere_\r\nand we should have staid there longer if the cold had not driven us\r\nout; which struck in to our backs, even to make our teeth crack; we\r\nreascended the slope, not forgetting, all of us as many as we were, to\r\nprovide and load ourselves with ice, which served us at lunch in the\r\nlittle village mentioned above to drink most delightfully, assuring\r\nyou that it is impossible to drink more freshly than we drank then. I\r\nthought of those old voluptuaries, who cooled their wine with snow, and\r\nit seemed to me, as though they might have had it much cheaper if in\r\ntheir time there had been many such _Froidieres_, to refresh it with\r\nice, instead of with snow, as some of the gentlemen of the neighborhood\r\nof the _Froidiere_ and some of the most notable persons of the\r\nneighborhood of Bezenson do; who by night, have a good supply brought\r\non horses, which they keep in their caves, and use at their meals and\r\nbanquets. Turning back towards the Imperial city of Bezenson, I carried\r\nfor about two great leagues, a rather large icicle in my hands, which\r\nlittle by little melted and was a pleasant and agreeable cooler, on\r\naccount of the great heat of the weather. After having thought over in\r\nmy mind, the cause of this _antiperistase_, I could find none other but\r\nthis: to wit, that as heat domineers in summer, the cold retires to\r\nplaces low and subterranean, such as is this one, to which the rays of\r\nthe sun cannot approach, and that in such an aquatic and humid place,\r\nit operates the results, which we have shown above. Which seemed to me\r\nso much more likely, that on asking the peasants of the neighboring\r\nvillage, if in winter there was ice in this _Froidiere_, they answered\r\nme that there was none, and that on the contrary, it was very warm\r\nthere. Whatever may be the cause, whether this or another, I can assure\r\nyou, that I admired this singularity as much as any I have seen,\r\nsince a large church, cut into a rock which I had seen a few years\r\npreviously, in a little town of Gascony called St. Milion, distant\r\nseven leagues from Bordeaux; on the steeple of which is the cemetery,\r\nwhere they bury the dead; a thing to be marvelled at by him who has not\r\nseen it.\r\n\r\n\"I have made trial, to enrich this missive, with all the artifice\r\nwhich has come into my head, using the leisure, which the present time\r\nbrings me: as the temple of Janus is open, the air beyond breathing\r\nnothing but war: which forces me, against my wish, to sojourn in this\r\nplace longer than I had intended. If these troubles settle down, and if\r\nafter the rain, God sends us fine weather as requires the calamitous\r\nstate in which is now the flat country, I shall return to my Parnassus;\r\nfrom which if I go out hereafter, believe that it will be very much in\r\nspite of myself, or that my will will have very much changed. You will\r\nbe able to let me hear from you there, and take your revenge for the\r\nprolixity of this letter, by sending me one still longer, which you\r\nwill write to me with more pleasure, as I shall take much in reading\r\nit. However as it is becoming time to sound taps, I will pray the\r\nsovereign creator for my affectionate recommendations to your graces.\r\n\r\n\"Sir, and best friend, may you keep in health and have a long and happy\r\nlife. From Sens this 20th of June 1585.\r\n\r\n\"Your obedient friend, BENIGNE POISSENOT.\r\n\r\n\"End of the description of the marvel, called the _Froidiere_.\"\r\n\r\nThe next notice about the Glacière de Chaux-les-Passavant is by Gollut\r\nin 1592, as follows:--\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: \"Ices in summer.\"]\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish however to omit (since I am in these waters) to bring to\r\nmind the commodity, which nature has given to some dainty men, since\r\nat the bottom of a mountain of Leugné ice is found in summer, for the\r\npleasure of those who wish to drink cool. Nevertheless at this time,\r\nthis is disappearing, for no other reason (as I think) except, that\r\nthey have despoiled the top of the mountain, of a thick and high mass\r\nof woods, which did not permit that the rays of the sun came to warm\r\nthe earth, and dry up the distillations, which slipped down to the\r\nlowest and coldest part of the mountain where (_by antiperistase_) the\r\ncold got thicker, and contracted itself against the heats surrounding\r\nand in the neighborhood during the whole summer, all the external\r\ncircumference of the mountain.\"\r\n\r\nThe ice at Chaux-les-Passavant is said to have been entirely cleared\r\nout, by the Duc de Lévi, in 1727, for the use of the Army of the Saone.\r\nIn 1743, when de Cossigny visited the cave, the ice was formed again.\r\nThere are no reports about the intervening time between 1727 and 1743.\r\nThe ice probably all re-formed the winter after it was taken away.\r\n\r\nCaptain Trouillet in 1885 writes of Chaux-les-Passavant: \"The following\r\nwinter had shown itself unfavorable to the production of ice, the\r\nperiods of humidity preceding too long ahead the periods of frost.\r\nFinally last summer, coming after a wet spring, was exceptionally\r\nwarm. Such were the circumstances which brought about in the glacière\r\nthe ruin which could be seen at the end of last October. * * * On\r\nthe 11th of November, the first effects of frost are felt and the\r\ntemperature falls in the glacière to -2°: outside the thermometer\r\ndrops to -3°. On the morning of the 12th, same result, and ice makes\r\nits appearance in the grotto, as the report of the observer shows: but\r\nthe quantity produced is so small that the internal thermometer soon\r\ngoes above 0°. It is only on the 9th of December that the frost wins\r\ndefinitely; on the 11th, 12th and 13th the chill is intense and reaches\r\n-19° outside, stopping at -15° in the glacière. The water coming from\r\nthe rains between the 5th and the 9th drip at this time through the\r\nroof and the big side crevasse: circumstances grow favorable and the\r\nice accumulates. From the 17th, the entrance slope becomes almost\r\nimpracticable; the icicles grow on the roof, as big as the body of a\r\nman. * * * From this time to the end of December, the ice sheet does\r\nnot increase, for water only arrives by the rare drip of the roof,\r\nand only the stalactites increase slowly. Outside, however, the cold\r\ncontinues vigorously, the thermometer on the 31st of December dropping\r\nto -15° and to -13° in the glacière. If the production of the ice\r\nstops, it is not the cold which is wanting, but the other element,\r\nthe one which as our former study showed, is the most rarely exact at\r\nthe meeting. The winter is only favorable on condition that it offers\r\nalternating periods of freezing and thawing; so the observer writes in\r\nhis report: 'it is the water which is wanting, otherwise the glacière\r\nwould be magnificent.'\"\r\n\r\nTrouillet speaks of the difficulty of winter observations in the\r\nfollowing words: \"Mons. Briot, the present lessor of the glacière, has\r\nthe unpaid mission of going every week to the bottom of the grotto to\r\nget and put in place the interior thermometer. It is a really hard\r\npiece of work at this time of the year: each journey takes about one\r\nhour. Besides the chance that a visitor has of receiving on his head\r\none of those magnificent stalactites 1 meter or 2 meters long which\r\nfall continually from the roof, it is perfectly disagreeable to him\r\nto arrive at the base of the slope otherwise than on the sole of his\r\nboots, and to face thus the frequent and painful meeting with rocks\r\nwhose angular edges dot the surface of the descent, smooth as a mirror\r\nset at an angle of 30°.\"\r\n\r\nTrouillet and Girardot obtained a series of observations with maxima\r\nand minima thermometers at Chaux-les-Passavant during the winter of\r\n1885-1886. At the end of November the temperature inside was +2°.\r\nOn the 2d of December it rose to +2.5°. On the 10th of December, it\r\nsank to -1°, and after this date, it remained below freezing point\r\nall winter. The observations were not continuous, but they showed\r\nthat every time the temperature outside dropped considerably, the\r\ntemperature inside immediately did likewise. For instance, on the\r\n12th of January, the outside air dropped to -18°, and the inside air\r\nresponded by falling to -15°. On the other hand, when the temperature\r\noutside rose above freezing point, the temperature inside remained\r\nstationary or fluctuated only gently. For instance, from the 24th\r\nof March to the 8th of April, the outside air went up and down\r\nperpetually, the extremes being -2° and +16°; while in the same time\r\nthe inside air rose continuously from -2° to -0.5°.\r\n\r\n\r\nWindholes and Ice Formations near Gérardmer, Vosges. (Rozet, in\r\n_Encyclopédie Moderne_, Didot Frères, Paris, 1853, vol. XVI., page 503.)\r\n\r\n\r\nL'Abime du Creux-Percé or Glacière de Pasques. (Martel, _Les Abimes_,\r\n1894, page 394; _Annuaire du Club Alpin Français_, vol. XIX., page\r\n38.)--On the plateau of Langres, Côte d'Or. It lies 15 kilometers\r\nfrom Dijon, and is really a limestone rock gorge, of 55 meters in\r\ndepth, which at the top is 40 meters long and 20 meters wide, and at\r\nthe bottom is 15 meters long and 12 meters wide. In March 1892, Mons.\r\nMartel found the north side covered with large icicles 15 meters long.\r\nThe ice seems to remain throughout the year. The bottom of the Abime\r\nhas been reached only by means of two long rope ladders.\r\n\r\n\r\nCreux de Chevroche or Roche Chèvre, Côte d'Or. (Clément Drioton,\r\n_Mémoires de la Société de Spéléologie_, 1897, vol. I., page 209.)--\"In\r\nthe woods of Mavilly, near Bligny-sur-Ouches, is a little cave, called\r\nCreux de Chevroche or Roche-Chèvre, where one can find ice until the\r\nmonth of July.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFreezing Well of Marolles, at La Ferté-Milon, Aisne. (Martel, _Les\r\nAbimes_, page 563, note 2.)--This well is 8.15 meters deep; the\r\naltitude is 70 meters. During the winter of 1892-93 the water in\r\nit froze for a thickness of 15 centimeters. The minimum outside\r\ntemperature that year was -17°.\r\n\r\n\r\nWindholes near Pontgibaud, Puy de Dome. (G. Poulett-Scrope, _The\r\nGeology and Extinct Volcanoes of Central France_, 1858, page\r\n60.)--These windholes are in basalt. There are many cracks, whence cold\r\nair currents issue, and where ice has been found, sometimes in summer.\r\nThere are cold storage huts over some of the cracks.\r\n\r\n\r\nLe Creux-de-Souci, Puy de Dome. (Martel, _Les Abimes_, 1894, Page\r\n387.)--This is situated 5 kilometers southeast of Besse-en-Chandesse.\r\nIt is a large lava cavern with the entrance directly in the middle of\r\nthe roof. The bottom is partly filled by a lake. The depth from the\r\nsurface of the ground to the lake is 33 meters; from the smallest part\r\nof the opening to the lake the depth is 21.50 meters. Down this last\r\nportion one can descend only by means of a rope ladder. The temperature\r\nis extremely low; in general near freezing point. In June, July, August\r\nand November 1892, Monsieur Berthoule, _maire_ of Besse, did not find\r\nany snow. On the 10th of August, 1893, on the contrary, he found at the\r\nbottom a heap of snow, which he thinks was formed in the cave itself,\r\nby the freezing during their descent of the drops of water which are\r\nconstantly dripping from the roof. He reports landing on _une montagne\r\nde neige, de neige blanche_. On several visits, Mons. Berthoule noticed\r\ncarbonic acid gas in dangerous quantities. There was none at the time\r\nhe observed the snow heap, but ten days later he found it impossible\r\nto descend into the cave as the carbonic acid gas came up in puffs to\r\nthe entrance. In the lake, Mons. Berthoule discovered a variety of\r\nRotifer, _Notholca longispina_, and also several algæ and diatoms.\r\nThe _Asterionella formosa_ is the most remarkable from its abundance:\r\nit exists in some of the lakes of the Alps, but not in those of the\r\nPyrenees.\r\n\r\n\r\nAven de Lou Cervi, Vaucluse. (Martel, _Les Abimes_, page 563.)--This is\r\na cold cave. It belongs to the class which Mons. Martel calls _avens\r\nà rétrécissement_, or _abimes à double orifice_. In September, 1892,\r\nMons. Martel noted a temperature of 6.5° at 53 meters; of 6.8° at 64\r\nmeters. Mean temperature of locality, 8.75°.\r\n\r\n\r\nIgue de Biau, Lot. (Martel, _Les Abimes_, page 304.)--Cold cave.\r\nTemperature on 13th July, 1891: 5°.\r\n\r\n\r\nFosse Mobile, Charente. (Martel, _Les Abimes_, page 380.)--Cold cave.\r\nTemperature on 11th April, 1893: 7°.\r\n\r\n\r\nAven de Deidou, Causse Méjean. (Martel, _Les Abimes_, page 223.)--Cold\r\ncave. Temperatures on 14th October, 1892: outside air, 4°; at bottom,\r\n6.5°.\r\n\r\n\r\nAven des Oules, Causse Méjean. (Martel, _Les Abimes_, page 227.)--Cold\r\ncave. Temperatures on 21st October, 1892: outside air, 2.5°; at bottom,\r\n4°.\r\n\r\n\r\nWindhole Cold Caves near Roquefort, Aveyron.--They lie 13 kilometers\r\nfrom Millau, at an altitude of about 600 meters, and are utilized in\r\nthe manufacture of Roquefort cheese.\r\n\r\n\r\nAven de Carlet, near la Roche Giron, Basses Alpes. (Martel, _Les\r\nAbimes_, page 53.)--Lumps of ice are reported to have been taken from\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\nLa Poujade, Cévennes. (Martel, _Les Abimes_, pages 212-215.)--An\r\nintermittent spring in limestone rock. At the bottom of the first\r\ngallery, on the 18th of September, 1892, the temperature of the air was\r\n12.3°, and that of a pool of water supplied by drip 11.5°. Mons. Martel\r\nthought that the drip brought to the pool the mean annual temperature\r\nof the ground through which it had come. A little further within and 5\r\nmeters lower, the temperature of the air was 7.3° and that of another\r\npool of water 6.8°. This pool was not supplied by drip and must have\r\nbeen left over by the last flow of the spring. Mons. Martel thought\r\nthat the lower temperatures at this spot were due to the cold air of\r\nwinter dropping to the bottom of the cave and on account of its density\r\nnot being able to get out.\r\n\r\n\r\nSnow Preserved in Chasms in the Italian Mountains. (_The Penny\r\nMagazine_, London, August, 1834, page 335.)--Mr. Bunford Samuel called\r\nmy attention to an article in which the Southern Italians are said to\r\ndig wells or cellars on the mountain sides, and to throw snow into them\r\nin winter. The snow is well pressed together and straw, dried leaves,\r\netc., is thrown on top. By having a northern exposure for these pits,\r\nand seeing that they are in thick forest, or in rifts where the sun\r\ndoes not penetrate, these depots may be safely placed as low down the\r\nmountain as the snow falls and lies. Naples is largely supplied [1834]\r\nwith snow in summer from such snow wells situated on Monte Angelo, the\r\nloftiest point of the promontory separating the Bay of Naples from the\r\nBay of Salerno.\r\n\r\n\r\nCold Caves of San Marino, Apennines. (De Saussure, _Voyages dans les\r\nAlpes_, 1796, III., page 211.)--These are probably windholes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLa Bocche dei Venti di Cesi. (De Saussure, _Voyages dans les Alpes_,\r\n1796, III., page 211.)--These windholes were in the cellar of the\r\nhouse of Don Giuseppe Cesi, in the town of Cesi. The cellar acted as a\r\nnatural refrigerator. The air stream was so strong, that it nearly blew\r\nout the torches. In winter the wind rushed into the holes. De Saussure\r\nwas shown the following Latin verses by the owner:--\r\n\r\n    \"Abditus hic ludit vario discrimine ventus\r\n    Et faciles miros exhibet aura jocos.\r\n    Nam si bruma riget, quaecumque objeceris haurit.\r\n    Evomit aestivo cum calet igne dies,\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWindholes or \"Ventarole\" on Monte Testaceo, near Rome. (De Saussure,\r\n_Voyages dans les Alpes_, 1796, III., page 209.)--There are a number\r\nhere among heaps of broken pottery. The temperatures seem abnormally\r\nlow.\r\n\r\n\r\nKrypta Sorana. (Kircher, _Mundus Subterraneus_, 1664, page 118 and\r\npage 239.)--This has been spoken of as a glacière cave, but as there\r\nis much doubt in the matter, I quote the passages, on which the\r\nreports are based, in the original Latin: \"Cryptae sunt naturales,\r\nquarum innumerae sunt species, juxta vires naturales iis inditas. Sunt\r\nnonnullae medicinali virtute praeditae, quaedam metallicis vaporibus,\r\nexhalationibus, aquis scatent, sunt et glaciales, plenae nivibus et\r\ncrystallo, uti in Monte Sorano me vidisse memini.\" And further: \"Vidi\r\nego in Monte Sorano cryptam veluti glacie incrustatam, ingentibus in\r\nfornice hinc inde stiriis dependentibus, e quibus vicini montis accolae\r\npocula aestivo tempore conficiunt, aquae vinoque, quae iis infunduntur,\r\nrefrigerandis aptissima, extremo rigore in summas bibentium delicias\r\ncommutato.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSubterranean Ice Sheet, Mount Etna, Sicily. (Lyell, _Principles of\r\nGeology, 11th Edition_, chapter XXVI.)--This ice sheet is near the\r\nCasa Inglese. Sir Charles Lyell ascertained the fact of its existence\r\nin 1828, and in 1858 he found the same mass of ice, of unknown extent\r\nand thickness, still unmelted. In the beginning of the winter of\r\n1828, Lyell found the crevices in the interior of the summit of the\r\nhighest cone of Etna encrusted with thick ice, and in some cases hot\r\nvapors actually streaming out between masses of ice and the rugged and\r\nsteep walls of the crater. Lyell accounts for this ice sheet by the\r\nexplanation that there must have been a great snow bank in existence\r\nat the time of an eruption of the volcano. This deep mass of snow\r\nmust have been covered at the beginning of the eruption by volcanic\r\nsand showered on it, followed by a stream of lava. The sand is a bad\r\nconductor of heat and together with the solidified lava, preserved the\r\nsnow from liquefaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlacière on the Moncodine. (Fugger, _Eishöhlen_, page 13.)--The\r\nMoncodine is described as a Dolomite near the Lago di Como. The cave\r\nlies up the Val Sasina, two hours from Cortenuova, at an altitude of\r\n1675 meters. The entrance faces north, and is 2.5 meters high and 1.5\r\nmeters wide. The average diameter of the cave is 16 meters. The floor\r\nis solid ice, which has been sometimes cut for use in the hotels on the\r\nLago di Como and even been sent to Milan.\r\n\r\n\r\nLa Ghiacciaia del Mondole. (Fugger, _Eishöhlen_, page 8.)--The Mondole\r\nis a mountain 2375 meters high, near Mondovi, south of Turin. The cave\r\nlies on the eastern slope, at an altitude of about 2000 meters. It is\r\nhard to get at. The entrance is to the east, and is 2 meters wide and\r\n1.5 meters high. A passageway some 25 meters long leads to a large\r\nchamber where there is plenty of ice. In hot summers ice is brought\r\nfrom the cave to Mondovi. _Ghiacciaia_ means freezing cavern in Italian.\r\n\r\n\r\nLa Ghiacciaia del Val Séguret. (Fugger, _Eishöhlen_, page 8.)--It lies\r\nnear Susa at the base of chalk cliffs, at an altitude of about 1500\r\nmeters. The cave is said to be about 40 meters deep, 50 meters wide and\r\n50 meters high. Bonetti in May, 1874, found many icicles and ice cones.\r\n\r\n\r\nLa Borna de la Glace. (Chanoine Carrel, _Bibliothèque Universelle de\r\nGenève_, 1841, vol. XXXIV., page 196.)--It lies in the Duchy of Aosta,\r\ncommune of La Salle, on the northern slope of the hills near Chabauday,\r\nin a spot called Plan Agex. The altitude is 1602 meters. The entrance\r\nopens to the east and is 60 centimeters wide and 80 centimeters high.\r\nOne can descend for 4 meters. There are two branches in the rear of\r\nthe entrance. Chanoine Carrel found an ice pillar 1 meter high in the\r\nwestern branch. He recorded these temperatures on the 15th of July,\r\n1841: Outside +15°. Entrance +2.9°. East branch +0.9°. West branch\r\n+0.5°.\r\n\r\n\r\nWindholes in the Italian Alps. (Fugger, _Eishöhlen_, pages 94-97.)--A\r\nnumber of these seem to have abnormally low temperatures. Some are in\r\nthe mountains around Chiavenna, and are sometimes, by building small\r\nhuts over them, utilized as refrigerators. Some are reported in the\r\nneighborhood of the Lago di Como near Dongo, near Menaggio, and in the\r\nvilla Pliniana near Curino; in the neighborhood of the Lake of Lugano\r\nat the base of Monte Caprino, near Melide, near Mendrisio and near\r\nSertellino; and in the Val Maggia near Cevio.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Glacière de Font d'Urle, or Fondurle, Dauphiné. (Héricart de Thury,\r\n_Annales des Mines_, vol. XXXIII., page 157; G. F. Browne, _Ice Caves_,\r\netc., page 212; E. A. Martel, _Mémoires de la Société de Spéléologie_,\r\nvol. I., page 37; L. Villard, _Spélunca_, 1896, vol. II., page 39.)--It\r\nlies on the Foire de Font d'Urle, 16 kilometers north of Dié, 48\r\nkilometers east of Valence, and 80 kilometers south of Grenoble. The\r\nglacière consists of two large pits, lying east and west, and with\r\nunderground communication. From this tunnel a long low archway leads to\r\na broad slope of chaotic blocks of stone, which is 60 meters long and\r\n42 meters in greatest width. The ice begins half way down this slope,\r\nfitfully at first and afterwards in a tolerably continuous sheet. Thury\r\nfound many icicles hanging from the roof. Browne found four columns\r\nof ice, of which the largest was 5.80 meters across the base. On his\r\nvisit, in the middle of August, the ice was strongly thawing. Both\r\nexplorers noted the extremely prismatic character of the ice. Browne\r\nfound a temperature of +0.5°. Martel gives a section and plan of Font\r\nd'Urle. Mons. Villard says about this cavern: \"A curious thing: I found\r\nin this cave, motionless on a piece of rock, entirely surrounded by ice\r\nfor a distance of several meters, a blind specimen of a coleoptera,\r\n_Cytodromus dapsoïdes_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chourun Clot. (E. A. Martel, _Sous Terre_. _Annuaire du Club Alpin\r\nFrançais_, vol. XXIII., 1896, pages 42, 43; _Mémoires de la Société\r\nde Spéléologie_, vol. I., page 31.)--In Dauphiné, half way between\r\nAgnières and the Pic Costebelle, at an altitude of 1,740 meters. There\r\nis first a pit 18 meters long, 4.50 meters wide and 25 meters deep. In\r\nthe bottom of this is a vertical hole 15 meters deep and from 1 meter\r\nto 2 meters in diameter, in which there was much ice on the 31st of\r\nJuly, 1896. Then the pit changes to a sloping gallery which terminates\r\nin a little hall, full of ice, at a depth of 70 meters. Martel gives a\r\ncut and section of this glacière.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Glacière du Trou de Glas. (E. A. Martel, _La Géographie_, 1900,\r\nvol.

I., page\r\n53.)--In the range of the Dévoluy, Hautes-Alpes; altitude 1,580 meters.\r\nAn extremely deep pit, which on July 31st, 1899, was much blocked up\r\nwith snow.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chourun de la Parza. (E. A. Martel, _La Géographie_, 1900, vol. I.,\r\npage 54.)--In the range of the Dévoluy, Hautes-Alpes; altitude 1,725\r\nmeters. A fine pit, 25 meters in diameter, and 74 meters in depth.\r\nFilled with snow or rather névé, in which are deep holes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Glacière de l'Haut-d'Aviernoz. Described in Part I., page 2. (C.\r\nDunant, _Le Parmelan et ses Lapiaz_, page 26; Browne, _Ice Caves_,\r\netc., page 157.)--Mons. Dunant calls this glacière l'Haut d'Aviernoz;\r\nMr. Browne calls it the Glacière du Grand Anu. By a plumb line held\r\nfrom the edge of the larger pit, Browne found that the ice floor was\r\nabout 35 meters from the surface, which would give a level for the ice\r\nfloor closely identical to the one I found. In July, 1864, he recorded\r\na temperature of +1.1°.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Glacière de l'Enfer. (G. F. Browne, _Good Words_, November, 1866;\r\nT. G. Bonney, _The Alpine Regions_, 1868, pages 95, 96; C. Dunant, _Le\r\nParmelan et ses Lapiaz_, page 25.)--On Mont Parmelan. A pit cave with\r\na steep slope of broken rock leading to a rock portal in the face of\r\na low cliff. This opens into a roughly circular hall about 22 meters\r\nin diameter and 3 meters to 4 meters in height. A chink between the\r\nrock and the ice permitted Mr. Browne to scramble down three or four\r\nmeters to where a tunnel entered the ice mass. Throwing a log of wood\r\ndown this tunnel, a crash was heard and then a splash of water, and\r\nthen a strange gulping sound. \"The tunnel obviously led to a subglacial\r\nreservoir and this was probably covered by a thin crust of ice; the\r\nlog in falling had broken this and then disturbed the water below,\r\nwhich then commenced bubbling up and down through the hole, and making\r\na gulping noise, just as it does sometimes when oscillating up and down\r\nin a pipe.\"\r\n\r\nMons. C. Dunant of the _Club Alpin Français_ describes a visit to\r\nthe Glacière de l'Enfer. He mentions also a legend of a witch from a\r\nneighboring village who would get the ice from these caves and bring\r\nit down in the shape of hail on the crops of the peasants who were\r\ninhospitable to her.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Glacière de Chapuis. Described in Part I., page 5. (Browne, _Ice\r\nCaves_, etc., page 182, and _Good Words_, November, 1866.)--Mr. Browne\r\ncalls it the Glacière de Chappet-Sur-Villaz. Mr. Browne and Professor\r\nT. G. Bonney found several flies in the Glacière de Chapuis. Three of\r\nthem were specimens of _Stenophylax_, the largest being probably, but\r\nnot certainly, _S. hieroglyphicus_ of Stephens. Two smaller caddis\r\nflies were either _S. testaceus_ of Pictet or some closely allied\r\nspecies. One other insect was an ichneumon of the genus _Paniscus_,\r\nof an unidentified species. It differed from all its congeners in the\r\nmarking of the throat, resembling in this respect some species of\r\n_Ophion_. Mr. Browne thinks that the case flies may have been washed\r\ninto the cave somehow or other in the larva form, and come to maturity\r\non the ice where they had lodged. But this explanation will not hold\r\nin the case of the ichneumon, which is a parasitic genus on larvæ of\r\nterrestrial insects.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Glacière de Le Brezon. (Pictet, _Bibliothèque Universelle de\r\nGenève_, 1822, vol. XX., page 270, and Thury, _Bibliothèque Universelle\r\nde Genève_, 1861, vol. X., pages 139 and 152.)--It lies southeast of\r\nBonneville near the foot of Mount Lechaud, at an altitude of 1276\r\nmeters. The cave is 9.7 meters long, about 8 meters wide and the\r\ngreatest height is about 4 meters. The entrance is small and is at the\r\nbase of a cliff, in some places of which cold air currents issue. The\r\nice lies on the floor. Some of it is probably winter snow.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Glacière de Brisons.--Described in Part I., page 1.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Grand Cave de Montarquis. Described in Part I., page 70.\r\n(Thury, _Bibliothèque Universelle de Genève_, vol. X., pages\r\n135-153.)--Professor Thury describes two visits to this cave. On the\r\n16th of August, 1859, he found no ice stalactites or stalagmites. On\r\nthe 19th of January, 1861, he did not find a single drop of water in\r\nthe cave, but many stalactites and stalagmites of beautiful clear ice,\r\none of which resembled porcelain more than any other substance. In\r\nAugust, Thury found an air current streaming into the cave at the rear,\r\nbut this did not, however, disturb the air of the interior, for in one\r\npart it was in perfect equilibrium: along the line of the draughts\r\nthe ice was more melted than elsewhere in the cave. In January, the\r\ncurrent was reversed and poured into the fissure, with the temperature\r\nvarying between -1.5° and -2.5°. He observed the following temperatures\r\nat the Grand Cave:--\r\n\r\n                      TIME.        OUTSIDE.

In August, 1828, Morin found an ice stalagmite of 5 meters in\r\nheight in the middle of the cave.\r\n\r\n\r\nCave Containing Ice on the Southern Shore of Lake Geneva.--Reported; no\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Glacière and Neigière d'Arc-Sous-Cicon. (Browne, _Ice Caves_,\r\netc., page 118.)--These lie close together in the Jura about twenty\r\nkilometers from Pontarlier. The little glacière is formed by a number\r\nof fissures in the rock, disconnected slits in the surface opening into\r\nlarger chambers where the ice lies. The neigière is a deep pit, with a\r\ncollection of snow at the bottom, much sheltered by overhanging rocks\r\nand trees. A huge fallen rock covers a large part of the sloping bottom\r\nof the pit, which forms a small cave in the shape of a round soldier's\r\ntent, with walls of rock and floor of ice.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Glacière de la Genollière. Described in Part I., page 48. (Browne,\r\n_Ice Caves_, etc., page 1.)--Mr. Browne observed in 1864 a temperature\r\nof +1.1°, and two days later of +0.8°. He also found a number of flies\r\nrunning rapidly over the ice and stones. He was told in England,\r\nfrom the specimen he brought away, that it was the _Stenophylax\r\nhieroglyphicus_ of Stephens or something very like that fly.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Glacière de Saint-Georges. Described in Part I., page 62. (Thury,\r\n_Bibliothèque Universelle de Genève_, 1861, vol.

One of the main grounds for his opinion was\r\nthe series of observations he made in the Glacière de Saint-Georges.\r\nHe found no ice forming there in winter and the natives said it did\r\nnot because the cavern was not cold enough. So he placed large dishes\r\nfilled with water in the cave and found that they froze solid during\r\nthe night, which he had been assured was impossible. Thury also found\r\nviolent movements of the air at Saint-Georges in January, 1858. A\r\ncandle burned steadily for some time, but at 7.16 P. M. it began to\r\nflicker and soon inclined downwards through an angle of about 45°; and\r\nin the entrance, the flame assumed an almost horizontal position. At 8\r\nP. M., the current of air nearly disappeared. Thury thought that this\r\nviolent and temporary disturbance of equilibrium was due to the fact\r\nthat as the heavier air outside tended to pass into the cave, the less\r\ncold air within tended to pass out; and the narrow entrance confining\r\nthe struggle to a small area, the weaker current was able for a while\r\nto hold its own.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Glacière du Pré de Saint-Livres. Described in Part I., page\r\n65. (Browne, _Ice Caves_, page 40.)--Mr. Browne found, in 1864, a\r\ntemperature of 0°.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Petite Glacière du Pré de Saint-Livres. (Browne, _Ice Caves_, page\r\n46.)--This is near the last cave at a slightly higher altitude. There\r\nis first a small pit, then a little cave, in which there is an ice\r\nslope. This passes under a low arch in the rock wall, and leads down\r\ninto another small cave. Mr. Browne descended this ice stream, which\r\nwas itself practically a fissure column and spread into the fan shape\r\nat the base. The lower cave was 22 meters long and 11 meters wide, and\r\ncontained an ice floor and several fissure columns.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Glacière de Naye, above Montreux, Switzerland. (E. A. Martel, _Les\r\nAbimes_, page 397; _Spélunca_, 1895, vol. I., pages 107, 108; _Mémoires\r\nde la Société de Spéléologie_, vol. III., pages 246-254.)--This is\r\ncalled a _glacier souterrain_. It was discovered in 1893 by Professor\r\nDutoit. There are fifty-four caves known among the Rochers de Naye, and\r\nonly this one contains ice. It is a long narrow cave with two entrances\r\nand widest towards the base, which opens over a precipice. The altitude\r\nis high, the upper entrance being at an altitude of 1820 meters, and\r\nthe lower of 1750 meters. The place is both a passage cave and a\r\nwindhole. The snow falls into the upper entrance, and slides down,\r\nbecoming ice in the lower portion. There are other connecting passages\r\nand hollows where the cold air cannot get in, and there ice does not\r\nform. Mons. Martel thinks that the ice formed during the winter is\r\npreserved by the draughts--due to the difference in level of the two\r\nopenings--causing an evaporation and chill sufficient for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Creux Bourquin. (E. A. Martel, _Les Abimes_, page 397.)--At\r\nMauberget, near Grandson. This is a rock gorge 25 meters deep. At the\r\nbottom, on the 9th of July, 1893, was a mass of ice 38 meters long and\r\n8 meters wide.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Glacière de Monthézy. (Browne, _Ice Caves_, page 97.)--This lies\r\nto the west of Neufchâtel, between the Val de Travers and the Val de\r\nBrévine, on the path between the villages of Couvet and Le Brévine,\r\nat an altitude of 1100 meters. The cave is nearly oval in shape, with\r\na length of 34 meters and a width of 29 meters. The roof is from 1\r\nmeter to 3 meters high. There are three pits, about 20 meters deep, on\r\ndifferent sides of the cave. The descent is made through the largest\r\npit. On the 6th of July, 1864, Mr. Browne found the floor of the cave\r\ncovered with ice, and icicles and columns in some places; he also saw\r\na clump of cowslips (_primula elatior_) overhanging the snow at the\r\nbottom of the pit through which he descended.\r\n\r\n\r\nPertius Freiss. (T. G. Bonney, _Nature_, vol. XI., page 327.)--It lies\r\non the way to the Pic d'Arzinol, near Evolène, in the Val d'Hérens.\r\nA slip or subsidence of part of a cliff has opened two joints in the\r\nrock, in both of which fissures Professor Bonney found ice on July 23d.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Schafloch. Described in Part I., page 21. (Körber, _Jahrbuch des\r\nSchweizer Alpen Club_, 1885, vol.

Then comes a small ice slope, and a\r\nlittle horizontal floor at the back. Explored by Fugger.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlacières on the Eiskogel. (Fugger, _Eishöhlen_, page 19.)--The\r\nEiskogel is in the Tennengebirge, a mountain mass lying east of Pass\r\nLueg. At an altitude of about 1900 meters, are two small caves, about\r\n30 meters to 40 meters apart. They are some 25 meters in length and get\r\nsmaller towards the bottom.\r\n\r\n\r\nHoles with Ice in the Tennengebirge, between the Schallwand and the\r\nTauernkogel.

The floor of the cave is 13 meters\r\nbelow the entrance.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Posselthöhle. (A. Posselt-Csorich, _Zeitschrift des Deutschen\r\nund Osterreichischen Alpen Verein_, 1880, page 273.)--Named after\r\nits discoverer. It lies on the Hochkogel in the Tennengebirge, at an\r\naltitude of about 1900 meters. The entrance faces southwest, and is\r\nabout 8 meters high and 8 meters wide. From the entrance the cave first\r\nrises, then sinks again below the level of the entrance, where the\r\nice begins. The cave is about 20 meters wide. About 180 meters were\r\nexplored, to a point where a perpendicular ice wall, 6 meters high,\r\nbarred the way. About 125 meters from the entrance, there was an ice\r\ncone about 7 meters high.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gamsloch or Diebshöhle. (Fugger, _Eishöhlen_, page 14.)--It lies\r\non the Breithorn of the Steinernes Meer, near the Riemannhauss, at an\r\naltitude of about 2180 meters. The entrance faces south. There is first\r\na small, then a larger chamber. The latter is some 40 meters long, by\r\n5 meters or 6 meters wide. The ice is in the large chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\nEishöhle am Seilerer. (Fugger, _Eishöhlen_, page 15.)--On the\r\neastern side of the Seilerer arête on the Ewigen Schneeberg, west of\r\nBischofshofen, at an altitude of about 2400 meters, is a small glacière\r\ncave.\r\n\r\n\r\nCave in the Hagengebirge, West of Pass Lueg. (Fugger, _Eishöhlen_, page\r\n15.)--It lies about 2 kilometers east of Kalbersberg, at an altitude of\r\nabout 2000 meters. A snow slope, with an ice floor at the bottom, leads\r\ninto a long cave, about which little is known.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nixloch. Described in Part I., page 57. (Fugger, _Eishöhlen_,\r\npage 98.)--Professor Fugger gathered some valuable data in connection\r\nwith the Nixloch. In August, 1879, he found the air current entering\r\ndownwards; on September 14th, 1879, there was no current either way.\r\nOn Christmas day, 1878, on the contrary, the draughts were reversed,\r\npouring out of the hole with a temperature of +7.4°: the outside air\r\nthen being -7.4°. At this time the known lower opening was in existence.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kolowratshöhle. Described in Part I., page 18. (Fugger,\r\n_Beobachtungen_, etc., page 7.)--This cavern has been more carefully\r\nstudied than any other glacière cave. Some of its dimensions are given\r\nby Professor Fugger as follows: From the entrance to the ice floor,\r\n26.6 meters; surface covered by ice as measured on a plane, 2940\r\nsquare meters; approximate cubical measure of entire cave, 92,000 cubic\r\nmeters. The height of the entrance is 7 meters, with a width at the\r\nbase of 2.7 meters, and at the top of 6.6 meters.\r\n\r\nOn the entrance slope occurred the only fatal accident I know of in\r\nglacières. In 1866, the Bavarian minister Freiherr von Lerchenfeld\r\ntried to descend; a wooden handrail which had been erected over the\r\nsnow broke under his weight; von Lerchenfeld fell to the bottom of the\r\ncave and died a few days after from the injuries he received.\r\n\r\nOf the Kolowratshöhle, we have numerous thermometric observations by\r\nProfessor Fugger, of which I select a few.\r\n\r\n      DATE.

(Fugger, _Beobachtungen in den Eishöhlen\r\ndes Untersberges_, page 80.)--On the southeast slope of the Untersberg\r\nnear Salzburg, at an altitude of 1580 meters. The path leads past the\r\nKienbergalp over the Mitterkaser and the Sandkaser. In front of the\r\nentrance is a sort of rock dam, 30 meters long and 5 meters or 6 meters\r\nhigher than the entrance. Masses of snow fill the space between the\r\ntwo. The entrance is about 20 meters wide and from 2 meters to 3 meters\r\nhigh. A snow slope of 25 meters in length, set at an angle of 25°,\r\nleads to the ice floor. The cave is 54 meters long, from 13 meters to\r\n22 meters broad and from 4 meters to 10 meters high. The cave has been\r\nrepeatedly examined by Fugger, who has always found most snow and ice\r\nin the beginning of the hot weather, after which it gradually dwindles\r\naway.\r\n\r\nOf the Schellenberger Eisgrotte, we have the following thermometric\r\nobservations by Professor Fugger:--\r\n\r\n     DATE.

(Fugger, _Eishöhlen_, page 24.)--A small cave between the\r\nHochkasten and Ostrowiz in the Priel range.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Geldloch or Seelücken on the Oetscher. (Schmidl, _Die Höhlen\r\ndes Ötscher and Die Oesterreichischen Höhlen_; Cranmer and Sieger,\r\n_Globus_, 1899, pages 313-318, and 333-335.)--The second known notice\r\nof a glacière cave is the account of a visit to the Oetscher Caves\r\nin 1591. After lying in manuscript for two and a half centuries, it\r\nwas published by Dr. A. Schmidl in 1857, in _Die Höhlen des Ötscher_,\r\npages 21-36. According to the account, which is naive, but evidently\r\ntruthful, Kaiser Rudolf II. ordered Reichard Strein, owner of the\r\nHerrschaff Friedeck, to investigate the Ötscher and especially its\r\ncaves. He did so, with the title of _Kaiserlicher Commissarius_, and\r\naccompanied by the _Bannerherr_ Christoph Schallenberger, Hans Gasser,\r\nand eleven porters. On September the 16th, 1591, they visited the\r\nSeelücken, where they found a lake in the front of the cave, and where\r\nthe party had great difficulties in climbing round on to the ice.\r\n\r\nThe Seelücken on the Oetscher is situated at an altitude of 1470\r\nmeters. It opens nearly due south. The ice floor is about 20 meters\r\nbelow the entrance and is about 38 meters long and 24 meters wide; at\r\nthe rear, it rises for some 15 meters as an ice wall at an angle of\r\nabout 60°, and then forms a second ice floor about 45 meters long by\r\n19 meters wide. The front part of the ice is sometimes, about July,\r\ncovered with water. The cave continues further back, in two branches,\r\nand Professors Cranmer and Sieger consider that it is a large windhole,\r\nin which draughts are infrequent, on account of its length and because\r\nthe openings are near the same level. There are also several up and\r\ndown curves and in these cold air remains and acts something like a\r\ncork in stopping draughts.\r\n\r\nOn the 13th of September there were no draughts, and the temperatures\r\nbetween 11 A. M. and 12 M. were:--\r\n\r\n  Outside air                     +7.1°\r\n  Inside near entrance            +1.5°\r\n  A little further in             +1.1°\r\n  At the lowest point near ice    +0.8°\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of October, 1897, there was a draught, which followed the\r\ncurves of the cavern, and which flowed out at the southern end. The\r\ntemperatures were:--\r\n\r\n  Outside air                          +3.7°\r\n  Inside near entrance                 +1.3°\r\n  At the lowest point near ice         +0.8°\r\n  On the second, higher ice floor      +1.0°\r\n  In the main passage behind ice       +1.4°\r\n\r\n\r\nCave on the Kühfotzen near Warscheneck. (Fugger, _Eishöhlen_, page\r\n25.)--A small cave containing ice.\r\n\r\n\r\nEiskeller on the Rax. (Fugger, _Eishöhlen_, page 25; Cranmer,\r\n_Eishöhlen_, etc., page 61.)--Altitude about 1660 meters. A doline with\r\na small cave at the bottom, in which melting snow was found on the 19th\r\nof September, 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tablerloch. (Cranmer, _Eishöhlen_, etc., pages 19-60.)--On the\r\nDürren-Wand in the mountains south of Vienna, 2 hours distant from\r\nMiesenbach R. R. station. Altitude about 1000 meters. Entrance 7 meters\r\nwide, 3.5 meters high. Slope 30° from entrance. Lowest point 22 meters\r\nbelow entrance. Extreme length of cave 50 meters, width 23 meters,\r\nheight 15 meters. Professor Cranmer found fresh ice beginning to form\r\non the 12th of November, 1893; on the 1st of December, 1894; and on\r\nthe 20th of October, 1895. He found it melting away on the 3d of June,\r\n1894; on the 1st of June, 1895; and on the 31st of May, 1896. The rates\r\nat which the ice formed or melted, however, were not always the same in\r\ndifferent parts of the cave. The greatest amount of ice observed seems\r\nto have been in March and April. In the summer months no perceptible\r\nmovements of air seem to have been noticed. This was also sometimes the\r\ncase in the winter months, during which, however, movements of air were\r\nat other times plainly perceptible.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Gipsloch. (Cranmer, _Eishöhlen_, etc., page 60.)--A small cave on\r\nthe Hohen-Wand near Wiener-Neustadt. It is rather a cold cave than a\r\nglacière.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Windloch.

(Cranmer, _Eishöhlen_,\r\netc., page 64.)--Altitude about 1600 meters. A moderately large cave.\r\nOn the 21st of August, 1895, there was an ice floor 10 meters long and\r\n5 meters broad. Temperature in rear of cave, -0.2°.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaves on the Beilstein. (Krauss, _Höhlenkunde_, 1894, pages 207-219;\r\nCranmer, _Eishöhlen_, etc., page 63.)--These lie about 4 hours on foot\r\nfrom Gams in Steiermark, at an altitude of 1260 meters, in a place\r\nwhere the mountain is much broken up by fissures and snow basins. The\r\nlarge cave has two openings, from which steep snow slopes descend.\r\nThe cave is 60 meters long, 15 meters to 18 meters broad, and about 7\r\nmeters high. Clefts in the rock in two places lead to two lower, small\r\nice chambers. In the neighborhood of the large cave are two small ones.\r\nProf. Cranmer found fresh ice in the Beilsteinhöhle on the 20th of\r\nAugust, 1895. Two days before, fresh snow had fallen on the neighboring\r\nmountain peaks.\r\n\r\n\r\nEishöhle on the Brandstein. (Cranmer, _Eishöhlen_, etc., page 62.)--A\r\nsmall cleft cave near the Langriedleralm near Gams in Steiermark.

(Fugger, _Eishöhlen_, page 29.)--On the Göserwand near\r\nDürnthal, Glemeinde Gschaid in Steiermark. A large cave, some 190\r\nmeters long and 80 meters wide. A thin ice crust has been found on\r\nparts of the walls in the rear.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaves in the Stein Alps. (Fugger, _Eishöhlen_, page 29.)--The plateau\r\nof Velica Planina lies, at an altitude of 1600 meters, 9 kilometers\r\nnorth of Stein in the Duchy of Krain. There are three caves containing\r\nice on the plateau. The first is a big one and is called V. Kofcih. The\r\nsecond is called Mala Veternica. The third and biggest is called Velika\r\nVeternica; its length is about 100 meters and its breadth 30 meters.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlacière Caves on the Nanos Mountain. (Fugger, _Eishöhlen_, page\r\n34.)--In the southwestern Krain, 5 kilometers from Präwald. There are\r\nfour caves containing ice reported on the Nanos mountain. Two of them\r\nare big.

(E. A. Martel, _Les Abimes_, page 564,\r\nnote.)--During the winter of 1889-1890, Herr Marinitsch found\r\nstalactites of ice as far as the seventeenth cascade of the Recca; 1000\r\nmeters from the third entrance of the river. The temperature of the\r\nRecca was then at 0°; during the summer, the temperature of the water\r\nrises to 27° (?).\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Grosses Eisloch of Paradana. (Fugger, _Eishöhlen_, page 36.)--On\r\nthe high plateau of the forest of Tarnowa, east of Görz. A large pit\r\ncave, 30 meters to 40 meters deep. Professor Fugger says of it: \"The\r\nflora in the basin-like depression has the character of high mountain\r\nvegetation, with every step it resembles more this flora as it exists\r\nin the neighborhood of glaciers, until finally in the deepest point of\r\nthe basin all vegetation stops.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kleines Eisloch of Paradana. (Fugger, _Eishöhlen_, page 37.)--A\r\nsmall pit glacière, 500 meters distant from the Grosses Eisloch of\r\nParadana.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuchy Brezen. (Fugger, _Eishöhlen_, page 37.)--A small pit glacière,\r\nsituated about midway between the Grosses and Kleines Eisloch of\r\nParadana.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrevalo Cave. (Fugger, _Eishöhlen_, page 37.)--In the Buchenhochwald,\r\nsouth of Karnica. Small glacière.\r\n\r\n\r\nCave of Dol. (Fugger, _Eishöhlen_, page 38.)--On a mountain near\r\nHaidenschaft.

VII., page 64.)--A small glacière.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlacière Cave near Lazhna-gora or Latzenberg. (Valvasor, _Die Ehre des\r\nHerzogthumes Crain_, vol. I., pages 242, 243; Hacquet, _Oryctographia\r\nCarniolica_, 1778, III., page 159.)--In the neighborhood of Vishnagora\r\nin the Krain. The entrance is under a church. It is a large cave, 40\r\nmeters long and 20 meters high, where the ice all melts by the end of\r\nthe summer. Valvasor gives the following account of this cave in 1689,\r\nwhich seems the first printed notice of a glacière in German:--\r\n\r\n\"Near to Lazchenberg up by the church of St. Nicholas, where a _Thabor_\r\nstands, one finds a big hole, which sinks into the stony rocks. Through\r\nthis one descends deep with torches: there opens then underneath as\r\nbig a cavity as the biggest church could be, and the same is extremely\r\nhigh, in the form of a cupola. One sees there different teeth, formed\r\nand hardened from the water turned to stone. Further down one arrives\r\nto a deep gully: into which, however, I have not been. On the other\r\nside one must again ascend, and then one comes again to a cupola: in\r\nwhich cupola ice stands up like an organ from the earth.\r\n\r\n\"There also one sees icicles of pure ice of different sizes and\r\nheights, of which many are one or two _klafters_ high and as thick as\r\na man; but many only two or three spans high or higher, and as thick\r\nas an arm, and some also thinner. This ice is formed from the drops\r\nof falling water; and indeed in summer; for in winter there is no ice\r\ntherein. Over such ice one must then ascend, as there are then said to\r\nbe separate holes and grottoes. But no one has been any further.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nGlacière on the Dini Verh. (Petruzzi in Haidinger's _Berichte_, etc.,\r\nvol. VII., page 67.)--Near Tomischle in the Krain. Small glacière.\r\n\r\n\r\nEiskeller near Rosseck. (Petruzzi in Haidinger's _Berichte_, etc., vol.\r\nVII., page 64.)--On the Pograca Mountain in the Krain, northeast of the\r\nHornwald, near the Meierhof Rosseck. Small glacière cave.\r\n\r\n\r\nGorge near Rosseck. (Valvasor, _Die Ehre des Herzogthumes Crain_, vol.\r\nI., page 243 and page 517 ; Petruzzi in Haidinger's _Berichte_, etc.,\r\nvol. VII., page 64.)--Behind the ruined castle of Rosseck, on the\r\nPograca Mountain in the Krain, is a gorge, at whose bottom are four\r\nlittle holes containing ice most of the year.\r\n\r\nValvasor wrote of this cave in 1689: \"Near Rosseck immediately back\r\nof the castle there opens a mighty cavern entirely in stony rock, and\r\nyawns in the shape of a cauldron down into the earth. Above as wide as\r\na good rifle shot, but below quite narrow. And there underneath there\r\nare many holes where the ice remains through the whole summer. From\r\nsuch ice have Duke Frederick Graf and Duke von Gallenberg daily made\r\nuse in summer to cool their wine. Six years ago I descended there in\r\nthe month of August, and found ice enough in all the holes.\"\r\n\r\nIn the same volume Freiherr Valvasor elaborates his remarks about this\r\ncave and that at Latzenberg, repeating in the main the observations\r\nin the paragraph just given. He says: \"There hang also long icicles\r\nwhich are quite pleasant to look at. * * * This ice breaks all too\r\neasily and quickly. * * * Contrarywise, however, this ice lasts much\r\nlonger in the sun and the heat than other ice. * * * Some might think\r\nit would eventually turn into stone: this, however, does not happen:\r\nfor it remains only in summer and disappears in winter: as I can say\r\nfor certain, as I have been in myself in the winter as well as in the\r\nsummer time. * * * For as in the summer the floor is quite covered with\r\nice: it makes walking so dangerous and bad that one cannot take a step\r\nwithout climbing irons; but in the winter time one goes safely and\r\nwell. * * *\"\r\n\r\nFreiherr Valvasor was evidently an accurate observer, and, if for his\r\nword \"winter\" we substitute \"autumn,\" his account will be much more\r\nnearly correct than might have been expected two centuries ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Kuntschner Eishöhle. (Petruzzi in Haidinger's _Berichte_, etc.,\r\nvol. VII., pages 65, 66.)--This is known also as the Töplitzer,\r\nUnterwarmberger or Ainödter Grotto. It lies 2 kilometers from\r\nKuntschen, and 12 kilometers from Töplitz near Neustädtel, in the\r\nKrain. Altitude about 630 meters. Petruzzi says: \"Of all so far\r\nnoticed ice grottoes it is the most wonderful and splendid.\" In August\r\nand September, 1849, the temperatures near the ice were about two\r\ndegrees above freezing. On the 16th of August, there were many long\r\nice stalagmites and stalactites; on the 29th of September they had\r\ndiminished materially. Petruzzi says also: \"One leaves the abundant\r\nvegetation of the Alpine summer flora, and through bushes and dwarf\r\nunderbrush, through bare and half moss covered rocks and débris,\r\nthrough rotten and twisted tree stems, one comes to the hall of eternal\r\nwinter, where the microscopic mosses of the north surround the thousand\r\nyear old stalactites, hanging from the dripping vault, with an always\r\npassing, always freshly forming, tender sulphur colored down.\" Dr.\r\nSchwalbe has also examined this cave.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Friedrichsteiner or Gottscheer Eishöhle.--Described in Part I.,\r\npage 51.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Handler Eisloch.--7 kilometers south of Gottschee and about twenty\r\nminutes from the village of Handlern, near Rieg.

It lies in the Bihar Mountains, three hours from the\r\nvillage of Ober-Girda, which can be reached from Gyula Fehérvar, via\r\nTopánfalva. It is a pit cave, in limestone, at an altitude of 1127\r\nmeters. The pit is about 57 meters broad, and 45 meters deep, with\r\nexceedingly steep walls. The entrance is in the northeast wall and\r\nis about 10 meters high. This leads into a nearly circular hall 47\r\nmeters in diameter and about 20 meters high. The floor is ice. In the\r\nsoutheast corner is a hole over 75 meters deep. In the northwest wall\r\nis an opening 14 meters wide, which forms the beginning of a sort of\r\ngallery 54 meters long and which at its further end is 24 meters wide\r\nand 8 meters high. This is also covered with a flooring of ice, which\r\nin some places can only be descended by step cutting. This passage\r\nis also richly adorned with ice stalactites and stalagmites. At its\r\nend is another also nearly circular hall, 21 meters in diameter and\r\nabout 22 meters high. This is called the '_Beszerika_' or church. In\r\none place there is a magnificent collection of ice stalagmites called\r\nthe \"Altar.\" Peters found in dirt on the sides of the cave remains\r\nof bats not very different from those now living in the vicinity. He\r\nthinks the bats may have come there before the cave became a glacière;\r\nor else that they may even now sometimes get into the first hall and\r\nthere perish from cold. This makes it uncertain, therefore, whether the\r\nremains can be considered as of the past or the present.\r\n\r\n\r\nEishöhle bei Roth.--Described in Part I., page 35.\r\n\r\n\r\nMines on the Eisenberg.

Ice has been found in this in April; Schwalbe found none there in\r\nJuly. The Kleines Loch was another small cold cave near the Ziegenloch,\r\nbut it has been filled up.

They took with them a plentiful supply of rugs,\r\nblankets and warm clothing, but notwithstanding all precautions,\r\ntheir experience was not of a sufficiently pleasant nature to tempt\r\nimitators.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLednica of Szilize. (M. Bel, _Philosophical Transactions_, London,\r\n1739, vol. XLI., page 41 _et seq._; Townson, _Travels in Hungary_,\r\n1797; Terlanday, _Petermann's Mittheilungen_, 1893, page 283.)--It lies\r\n1.5 kilometers from the village of Szilize, near Rosenau, in Gomör\r\nCounty, in the Carpathians, at an altitude of 460 meters. A pit about\r\n35 meters deep, 75 meters long, and 48 meters wide opens in the ground,\r\nand at the southern end, in the perpendicular wall, is the cave. The\r\nentrance is 22 meters wide, 15 meters high, and faces north. A slope 4\r\nmeters long sinks with an angle of 35° to the floor of the cave, which\r\nis nearly circular in form, with a diameter of about 10 meters. On\r\nthe east side of the cave there seems to be a hole in the ice some 10\r\nmeters deep.\r\n\r\nIn 1739, there was published in London a curious letter in Latin from\r\nMatthias Bel, a Hungarian _savant_, about the cavern of Szilize. He\r\nsays: \"The nature of the cave has this of remarkable, that, when\r\noutside the winter freezes strongest, inside the air is balmy: but it\r\nis cold, even icy, when the sun shines warmest. As soon as the snow\r\nmelts and spring begins, the inner roof of the cave, where the midday\r\nsun strikes the outside, begins to sweat clear water, which drops\r\ndown here and there; through the power of the inner cold it turns to\r\ntransparent ice and forms icicles, which in thickness equal large\r\nbarrels and take wonderful shapes. What as water drops from the icicles\r\nto the sandy floor, freezes up, even quicker, than one would think.\r\n\r\n\"The icy nature of the cave lasts through the whole summer, and what\r\nis most remarkable, it increases with the increasing heat of the sun.\r\nIn the beginning of the spring the soft winter's warmth begins to give\r\nway soon thereafter, and when spring is more advanced, the cold sets\r\nin, and in such a manner, that the warmer does the (outside) air\r\ngrow, the more does the cave cool off. And when the summer has begun\r\nand the dog days glow, everything within goes into icy winter. Then do\r\nthe drops of water pouring from the roof of the cave change into ice,\r\nand with such rapidity that where to-day delicate icicles are visible,\r\nto-morrow masses and lumps, which fall to the ground, appear. Here\r\nand there, where the water drips down the walls of the cave, one sees\r\nwonderful incrustations, like an artificial carpeting. The rest of the\r\nwater remains hanging on the ice, according to the warmth of the day.\r\nFor when for a longer time it is warmer, the ice of the stalactites,\r\nof the walls and of the floor increases; but when the ruling heat, as\r\nsometimes happens, is diminished through north winds or rainstorm,\r\nthe waters freeze more slowly, the ice drips more fully and begins to\r\nform little brooklets. When however the temperature gets warmer, the\r\nicy nature of the cave begins once more. Some have observed, that the\r\nnature of the grotto receives the changes of temperature ahead, like a\r\nbarometer. For, when a warmer temperature sets in outside, the waters\r\nchange into ice, several hours before the heat sets in, while the\r\nopposite takes place, when by day the temperature is colder; for then\r\neven by the warmest sky the ice begins to melt noticeably.\r\n\r\n\"When the dog days have passed and the summer has already changed\r\ninto fall, the cave with its own nature follows the conditions of the\r\nexternal air. In the early months and while the nights are growing\r\ncolder, the ice diminishes visibly; then when the air cools off more\r\nand more and when the brooks and side are rigid with frost, it begins\r\nto melt as though there was a fire built underneath, until, when winter\r\nreigns, it is entirely dry in the cave, without a sign of ice being\r\nleft behind. Then gentle warmth spreads into the entire cave, and this\r\nicy grave becomes a safety resort for insects and other small animals,\r\nwhich bear the winter with difficulty. But besides swarms of flies and\r\ngnats, troops of bats and scores of owls, hares and foxes take up their\r\nabode here, until with the beginning of spring, the cave once more\r\nassumes its icy appearance.\"\r\n\r\nThese assertions of Bel are the most inaccurate ones made about\r\nglacières. Yet, strange to say, they have colored the literature of\r\nthe subject down to our own times; and have been repeated many times,\r\nsometimes with, sometimes without, the hares and foxes; the latest\r\nrepetition seeming to occur in 1883.\r\n\r\n\r\nCave near the Village of Borzova, Torna County, Carpathians.

Their principal\r\nobserver, M. de Dittmar, thought that a cold and snowy winter would add\r\nmaterially to the supply of ice, but he also thought that a necessity\r\nto the existence of the ice in these troughs was an abundant water\r\nsupply from a spring, whose temperature should be so high as not to\r\nfreeze in winter. The cold is supplied by the winter temperatures.\r\nSome of the most important are reported--\r\n\r\nIn the Turachtach Valley.\r\n\r\nNear Kapitanskji Sasiek.\r\n\r\nIn the valley of the River Belvi.\r\n\r\nIn the valley of the River Antscha.\r\n\r\nIn the Kintschen Valley.\r\n\r\nIn the neighborhood of Kolymsk.\r\n\r\nIn the Werchojanski Mountains.\r\n\r\nIn the Stanowáj Mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\nKONDOOZ.\r\n\r\nCave of Yeermallik. (Burslem, _A peep into Toorkisthan_, 1846, chaps.\r\nX., XI.)--In the valley of the Doaub, northwest of Kabul. The entrance\r\nis half way up a hill, and is about 15 meters wide and 15 meters high.\r\nThis is a large cave, with many ramifications and galleries. In the\r\ncentre of a hall far within, Captain Burslem found a mass of clear ice,\r\nsmooth and polished as a mirror, and in the form of a beehive, with its\r\ndome-shaped top just touching the long icicles which depended from the\r\njagged surface of the rock. A small aperture led into the interior of\r\nthis cone, whose walls were about 60 centimeters thick and which was\r\ndivided into several compartments. Some distance from the entrance of\r\nthis cave there is a perpendicular drop of 5 meters. A short distance\r\nbeyond this, in one of the halls, were hundreds of skeletons of men,\r\nwomen and children, in a perfectly undisturbed state, also the prints\r\nof a naked human foot and the distinct marks of the pointed heel of an\r\nAfghan boot. The moollah, who was acting as guide, said the skeletons\r\nwere the remains of seven hundred men of the Huzareh tribe who took\r\nrefuge in the cave with their wives and children during the invasion of\r\nGenghis Khan, and who defended themselves so stoutly, that after trying\r\nin vain to smoke them out, the invader built them in with huge natural\r\nblocks of stone, and left them to die of hunger. Some of the Afghans\r\nsaid that the cave was inhabited by Sheitan, a possibility denied by\r\nthe moollah who guided Captain Burslem, on the philosophical plea that\r\nthe cave was too cold for such an inhabitant.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIMÁLAYA.\r\n\r\nGlacière Cave of Amarnath. (Miss Mary Coxe of Philadelphia showed me\r\na copy of a letter of Dr. Wilhelmine Eger describing a visit to this\r\ncave.)--It lies three days' journey from Pailgam in Kashmere, on the\r\nborders of Little Tibet. The altitude is evidently high as one crosses\r\nsnow fields to get to it. A small path zigzagging up a grassy slope\r\nleads to the cave and is a stiff climb from the valley. The cave opens\r\non the side of a mountain and has a large, almost square mouth at\r\nleast as big as the floor area within. The floor of the cave is the\r\ncontinuation of the grass slope and slants upwards and backwards to the\r\nback wall, the only case of the kind so far reported. This cave is most\r\ncuriously connected with religion. Dr. Eger says that there are two\r\nsmall blocks of ice in it which never melt. From time immemorial these\r\nblocks of ice have been sacred to the Hindoos who worship them--as\r\nre-incarnations--under the names of Shiva and Ganesh. Dr. Eger saw\r\nofferings of rice and flowers on them. Thousands of pilgrims come every\r\nyear at the end of July or beginning of August from all parts of India.\r\nThousands of miles have been traversed and hundreds of lives laid down\r\nthrough this journey. Every year people die either before reaching\r\nthe cave or after. The trip from Pailgam in Kashmere takes three days\r\nup and two days down, if one returns by a shorter route where the way\r\nis unsafe because of avalanches. So many have perished there that the\r\npass is called \"The Way of Death.\" This must be taken by one class of\r\npilgrims, _Sardhas_ or Holy Men, to complete the sacred circuit, but\r\nthe Hindoos say any one dying on the pass will go straight to heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\nIcicles Formed by Radiation. (General Sir Richard Strachey,\r\n_Geographical Journal_, 1900, vol. XV., page 168.)--On the Balch pass\r\nof the Balch range in Tibet, General Strachey, in 1848, saw icicles of\r\nwhich he says: \"On the rocks exposed to the south were very curious\r\nincrustations of ice, icicles indeed, but standing out horizontally\r\nlike fingers towards the wind. I was not able to understand how they\r\nwere caused, nor can I tell why they were confined to particular spots.\r\nThe thermometer stood at 41°[F.], and though the dew point at the\r\ntime would probably have been below 32°[F.], and the cold produced by\r\nevaporation sufficient therefore to freeze water, yet it is evident\r\nthat no condensation could ever take place simultaneously with the\r\nevaporation. * * * It has since occurred to me that these icicles were\r\nformed by radiation. I found, subsequently, in a somewhat similar\r\nposition, that a thermometer suspended vertically, and simply exposed\r\nto the sky in front of it, was depressed as much as 20° F. below the\r\ntrue temperature of the surrounding air. This result was, of course,\r\ndue to the radiation through the extremely dry and rarefied atmosphere\r\nat the great elevation at which the thermometer was exposed. As\r\nradiation takes place freely from a surface of ice, the growth of such\r\nicicles as those described might be due to the condensation of vapour\r\nbrought up by the southerly day winds that so constantly blow over\r\nthese passes, and its accumulation in the form of ice on the exposed\r\nextremity of the icicle, the temperature of which might thus have been\r\ngreatly reduced.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nINDIA.\r\n\r\nIce Formed by Radiation. (T. A. Wise, _Nature_, vol. V., page 189; R.\r\nH. Scott, _Elementary Meteorology_, Third Ed., pages 61, 62.)--Mr.\r\nBunford Samuel called my attention to the mode of manufacturing ice by\r\nradiation in India. It is as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"A very practical use of nocturnal radiation has been made from time\r\nimmemorial in India in the preparation of ice, and on such a scale that\r\nabout 10 tons of ice can be procured in a single night from twenty\r\nbeds of the dimensions about to be given, when the temperature of the\r\nair is 15° or 20° [F.] above the freezing point. * * * The locality\r\nreferred to is the immediate neighborhood of Calcutta. A rectangular\r\npiece of ground is marked out, lying east and west, and measuring 120\r\nby 20 feet. This is excavated to the depth of two feet and filled with\r\nrice straw rather loosely laid, to within six inches of the surface of\r\nthe ground. The ice is formed in shallow dishes of porous earthenware,\r\nand the amount of water placed in each is regulated by the amount of\r\nice expected.\r\n\r\n\"In the cold weather, when the temperature of the air at the ice fields\r\nis under 50°, ice is formed in the dishes. The freezing is most active\r\nwith N. N. W. airs, as these are driest; it ceases entirely with\r\nsoutherly or easterly airs, even though their temperature may be lower\r\nthan that of the N. N. W. wind.\r\n\r\n\"No ice is formed if the wind is sufficiently strong to be called a\r\nbreeze, for the air is not left long enough at rest, above the bed, for\r\nits temperature to fall sufficiently, by the action of radiation.\r\n\r\n\"The rice straw, being kept loose and perfectly dry, cuts off the\r\naccess of heat from the surface of the ground below it, and, when the\r\nsun goes down, the straw being a powerful radiator, the temperature\r\nof the air in contact with the dishes is reduced some 20° below that\r\nprevailing some two or three feet above them. The rapid evaporation of\r\nthe water into the dry air above creates also an active demand for heat\r\nto be rendered latent in the formation of steam, and the result of all\r\nthese agencies is the formation of ice, under favorable circumstances,\r\non the extensive scale above mentioned.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nKOREA.\r\n\r\nGlacière Cave on the Han Gang.--Messrs. J. Edward Farnum and George\r\nL. Farnum, of Philadelphia, inform me that they saw a small cave\r\ncontaining ice on the banks of one of the Korean rivers. It is about\r\n75 kilometers from Seoul, nearly northeast, near the ferry where the\r\nold road leading from Seoul towards northern Korea crosses the Han\r\nGang, the river which passes by Seoul. The entrance is small; perhaps\r\n2 meters wide. The cave is not thoroughly explored. Ice lies near the\r\nentrance, and as far back as the Messrs. Farnum could see.\r\n\r\n\r\nJAPAN.\r\n\r\nGlacière Lava Cave near Shoji. (_Evening Telegraph, Philadelphia,\r\nJanuary 2d, 1896._)--The cave is about 12 kilometers from Shoji, and is\r\nin lava. First there is a pit in the forest, some 5 meters wide by 15\r\nmeters deep. The cave opens into this. It seems to be some 400 meters\r\nlong and from 2 meters to 12 meters high. There is an ice floor in\r\nplaces, also many ice stalagmites. At the furthest point reached there\r\nis a strong air current, which extinguishes torches and so far has\r\nprevented further exploration. Ice from the cave has been cut by the\r\ncountry people for sale at Kofu, which is not far distant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\nSOME OPINIONS ABOUT GLACIÈRES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME OPINIONS ABOUT GLACIÈRES.\r\n\r\n\r\nBenigne Poissenot, in 1586, hinted that the cold of winter produced the\r\nice at Chaux-les-Passavant.[69]\r\n\r\n[69] See Part III.: page 193.\r\n\r\n\r\nReichard Strein and Christoph Schallenberger visited the caves on the\r\nÖtscher in 1591.[70]\r\n\r\n[70] See Part III.: page 231.\r\n\r\n\r\nGollut, in 1592, suggested the cold of winter as the cause of the ice\r\nat Chaux-les-Passavant.[71]\r\n\r\n[71] See Part III.: page 202.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the _Histoire de l'Académie Royale des Sciences_, 1686, Tome\r\nII., pages 2, 3, there is an account, with no author's name, of\r\nChaux-les-Passavant. The memoir states that in winter the cave is\r\nfilled with thick vapors and that after some trees were cut down near\r\nthe entrance, the ice was less abundant than formerly: that people\r\ncome for ice with carts and mules, but that the ice does not become\r\nexhausted, for one day of great heat forms more ice than could be\r\ncarried away in eight days in carts and wagons: and that when a fog\r\nforms in the cave, there is assuredly rain the following day, and that\r\nthe peasants in the neighborhood consult this curious \"almanac\" to know\r\nthe weather which is coming.\r\n\r\n\r\nFreiherr Valvasor, in 1689, wrote about some of the glacières of the\r\nKrain.[72]\r\n\r\n[72] See Part III.: pages 238, 239.\r\n\r\n\r\nBehrens, in 1703, thought it was colder in summer than in winter in the\r\ncaves near Questenberg in the Harz.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. de Billerez, in 1712, writes that at Chaux-les-Passavant it is\r\nreally colder in summer than in winter; and that the ice is harder than\r\nriver ice, and this he thinks is due to the presence of a nitrous or\r\nammoniacal salt, which he says he found in the rocks.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. de Boz made four trips to Chaux-les-Passavant on the 15th of May\r\nand 8th of November, 1725; and the 8th of March and 20th of August,\r\n1726. His memoir says that his observations tend to disprove those\r\nof M. de Billerez, and that \"the cause for the great cold, which is\r\nless great in summer, although always remaining, is quite natural.\"\r\nHe cites as causes for the ice the exposure to the north-north-east;\r\nthe rock portal sheltering the entrance, and all the forest covering\r\nthe surrounding lands; and adds that some veracious persons told him\r\nthat since some of the big trees above the grotto had been cut down\r\nthere was less ice than before. He found no traces of salt, nor any\r\nsprings, and that the water supply came from the rains and melted snows\r\nfiltering through the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1739, Matthias Bel published his curious account of Szilize.[73]\r\n\r\n[73] See Part III.: page 254.\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. N. Nagel, a Vienna mathematician, visited the Ötscher in 1747. He\r\nconcluded that the ice was made in winter and preserved in summer as in\r\nan ice house.\r\n\r\n\r\nM. de Cossigny wrote, in 1750, about Chaux-les-Passavant. He made\r\na plan of the cave and took many observations in April, August and\r\nOctober, and concluded that the interior condition of the cave does not\r\nchange noticeably from winter to summer, no matter what the external\r\nconditions of temperature may be; that what people say of greater cold\r\nin summer, vanishes before actual experience and that, as a state\r\nof freezing reigns more or less continuously in the cave, it is not\r\nsurprising if the ice accumulates. Apparently he was the first to\r\nnotice and insist on the necessity of drainage to the cave through\r\ncracks in the rocks. He also made a series of observations disproving\r\nthose of M. de Billerez, as to the presence of any kinds of salts in\r\nthe rocks or ice.\r\n\r\n\r\nHacquet, in 1778, thought that the ice in the cave at Lazhna-gora\r\nformed in winter, but he also thought that there must undoubtedly be\r\nsome salt in the water. He says he found ice in the cave in the spring,\r\nand that his companion, a priest, had never found any in winter. He\r\ntherefore concluded that by that time it had all melted.\r\n\r\n\r\nRomain Joly, in 1779, claims to have visited Chaux-les-Passavant on the\r\n19th of September (year not given). His account seems largely borrowed\r\nfrom the one in the _Histoire de l'Académie Royale des Sciences_, in\r\n1686. He says: \"This ice is formed by the drops of water which fall\r\nfrom the roof, and which freeze because of the chill of the cave.\r\nIn the winter there is no ice, but running water.\" He says nothing,\r\nhowever, about the ice forming in summer.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Citoyen_ Girod-Chantrans visited Chaux-les-Passavant in August,\r\n1783, and reached the conclusion, from all he saw and heard, that the\r\ncave did not freeze in summer nor thaw in winter, and that it was\r\nreally a natural ice house. He was aided by the notes of a neighboring\r\nphysician, Dr. Oudot, who had made observations in the cave, and among\r\nothers, had placed stakes of wood, on the 8th of January, 1779, in\r\nthe heads of the columns he had found in the cave; and on the 22d of\r\nFebruary, 1780, had found these stakes completely covered with ice,\r\nforming columns 30 centimeters in diameter.\r\n\r\n\r\nHablizl, in 1788, wrote that the ice in the cave near Karassoubazar\r\nformed in the spring by the snows which melt, run into the cave, and\r\nrefreeze. He also thought that there was less ice there in the fall\r\nthan in the spring, that it diminishes in July and August, and that the\r\nidea, current in the neighborhood, of the formation of ice in summer,\r\nis a mistake.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Pierre Prévost, in 1789, gave an accurate explanation of\r\nthe formation of the ice in Chaux-les-Passavant. He says: \"Weighing\r\ncarefully the local circumstances, one discovers in truth a few causes\r\nof permanent cold. But these causes seem rather suited to keep up a\r\ngreat freshness or to diminish the heat of summer, than to produce a\r\ncold such as that which reigns in the cavern. First of all, big trees\r\nthrow shade over the entrance; it is, I was told, forbidden under\r\nsevere penalties to cut down any of them, for fear of depriving the\r\ngrotto of a necessary shelter. In the second place, this entrance is\r\nsituated almost due north, leaning a little to the east, which is the\r\ncoolest exposure one can choose, and the one most suited to help the\r\neffect of the icy winds which blow from that quarter. Finally the slope\r\nis steep and the grotto deep and covered with a thick vault. These\r\nthree conditions united constitute, as it seems to me, a very good _ice\r\nhouse_; by which I mean a reservoir fit to preserve during the summer,\r\nthe ice which may bank up in winter.\r\n\r\n\"But how does this ice bank up? One knows that the outside waters\r\nabove form on the roof, during the winter, long drops and stalactites\r\nof ice. These icicles, which hang down and increase constantly by the\r\ndrip from the same source which formed them, fall at last, carried away\r\nby their own weight, and form so many centres, around which freeze\r\nthe waters with which the floor of the grotto is always inundated. At\r\nthe same time, the blowing of the north wind accumulates snow at the\r\nbase of the slope, which is uncovered in part and exposed above to all\r\nthe vicissitudes of the weather. Thus during the winter is formed an\r\nirregular heap of ice and snow, which the first heats of spring begin\r\nto make run, but which the heats of summer cannot finish dissolving.\r\nThe winter following has therefore even more facility to augment the\r\nmass of these ice pyramids, which have resisted until the fall. And if\r\nmen did not work at diminishing it, it might happen that it would fill\r\nthe entire cavern at last to a great height.\r\n\r\n\"I am therefore strongly inclined to think that the process of nature\r\nis here precisely similar to that of art; that without any especial\r\ncause of cold, the natural glacière of Besançon conserves in the\r\nmoderate temperature of deep caverns, the heaps of snow and ice which\r\nthe winds and the outside waters accumulate there during the winter;\r\nand that the melting of these snows and of these accumulated ices\r\nforms little by little the ice floor, scattered over with blocks and\r\npyramids, which one observes there during the summer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHorace Bénédict de Saussure, the great Swiss scientist and mountaineer,\r\nin 1796, published a number of observations about cold current caves\r\nin various parts of the Alps. He found that in summer the air blows\r\noutward at the lower end, and that in winter it draws inward. His\r\nexplanation is that in summer the colder air in the tube is heavier\r\nthan the outside air and displaces it by gravity; while in winter the\r\nrupture takes place in the other direction, since the column within the\r\ntube is warmer than the outside air and therefore is pushed upwards by\r\nthe heavy air flowing in. He concludes that evaporation due to the air\r\npassing internally over moist rocks suffices to explain the phenomenon\r\nof low temperatures and that such caves have a rather lower temperature\r\nin the Alps than in Italy owing to the greater natural cold of the\r\nSwiss lake region. An experiment of his is worth mentioning. He passed\r\na current of air through a glass tube, 2.5 centimeters in diameter,\r\nfilled with moistened stones, and found that the air current which\r\nentered with a temperature of 22.5° came out with a temperature of\r\n18.75°, that is with a loss of 3.75° of heat.\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert Townson, LL.D., in 1797, published an account, perhaps the first\r\nin English, of a glacière cave. He says of Szilize: \"Ice I truly found\r\nhere in abundance, and it was mid-summer, but in a state of thaw; the\r\nbed of ice, which covered the floor of the cavern was thinly covered\r\nwith water and everything announced a thaw. I had no need to use my\r\nthermometer: however I placed it in the ice and it fell to 0° of\r\nRéaumur: I then wiped it and placed it in a niche in the rock, at the\r\nfurthest part of the cavern, a yard above the ice and here it remained\r\nnear an hour: when I returned I found it at 0°. * * * Everything\r\ntherefore, ice, water and atmosphere in the neighborhood had the same\r\ntemperature, and that was the temperature of melting ice: 0° Réaumur.\r\n\r\n\"When then is the ice which is found here, and in such quantities\r\nthat this cavern serves the few opulent nobility in the neighborhood\r\nas an ice house, formed? Surely in winter, though not by the first\r\nfrost, not so soon as ice is formed in the open air. No doubt, from\r\nthe little communication this cavern has with the atmosphere, it will\r\nbe but little and slowly affected by the change. Should therefore,\r\nMr. Bel, or any of his friends, have come here to verify the common\r\nreport at the commencement of a severe frost, when the whole country\r\nwas covered with ice and snow, they might still have found nothing here\r\nbut water, or the ice of the preceding winter in a state of thaw, and\r\nthe cavern relatively warm; and likewise, should they have visited it\r\nin a warm spring, which had succeeded to a severe winter, they might\r\nhave found nothing here but frost and ice; and even the fresh melted\r\nsnow, percolating through the roof of this cavern, might again have\r\nbeen congealed to ice. I observed frequently in Germany in the severe\r\nwinter of 1794-5, on a sudden thaw, that the walls of churches and\r\nother public buildings, on the outside were white and covered with a\r\nhoar frost, and the windows on the same side covered with a rime.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Franz Sartori, in 1809, was a strong believer in the summer ice\r\ntheory, and wrote of the flies and the gnats, the bats and the owls,\r\nand the foxes and the hares coming to Szilize to winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlexander von Humboldt, in 1814, says about the Cueva del Hielo on the\r\nPeak of Teneriffe that so much snow and ice are stored up in winter\r\nthat the summer heat cannot melt it all, and also adds that permanent\r\nsnow in caves must depend more on the amount of winter snow, and the\r\nfreedom from hot winds, than on the absolute altitude of the cave.\r\n\r\n\r\nDewey, in 1819, thought that the ice in the Snow Glen at Williamstown\r\nwas a winter formation.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor M. A. Pictet visited Saint-Georges, Le Brezon and Montarquis\r\nand in 1822 endeavored to prove that they are cold current caves and\r\nthat the ice in them is due entirely to draughts causing evaporation.\r\nHe believed in the theory of the ice forming in summer more than in\r\nwinter and that it could not be the residue of a winter deposit. He\r\ntherefore argued that it must be due to descending currents of air\r\nwhich he thought would be most energetic in summer; that they would\r\nbecome at least as low as the mean annual temperature of the place\r\nand be still further cooled by evaporation. The strange thing about\r\nhis theories is that he does not seem to have personally observed any\r\ndraughts either at Saint-Georges or Le Brezon, but the fact that the\r\nice was evidently not an accumulation of winter snow led him to try to\r\nreconcile what he had himself seen with de Saussure's theories about\r\nwindholes.\r\n\r\n\r\nJean André Deluc in 1822 published a paper discussing the theories of\r\nMM. de Cossigny, Prévost and Pictet. Deluc had never visited a glacière\r\nhimself, but he explains clearly the impossibility of Professor\r\nPictet's cold current theory, on the simple ground that Professor\r\nPictet himself did not find any cold currents. He takes up Professor\r\nPrévost's theories warmly; using also the manuscript notes of Mons.\r\nColladon who had visited the Grand Cave de Montarquis. Deluc says:\r\n\"that the winter's cold penetrates into these caves, freezes the water\r\nwhich collects there and that the ice thus formed has not the time to\r\nmelt during the following summer.\" He says further: \"It seems that in\r\nthe three glacières with which we have been occupied there is a flat\r\nor rather hollow bottom, where the waters can form a more or less deep\r\npond, and whence they therefore cannot flow away; it is there they\r\nflow in winter; and as these are shut in places where the air cannot\r\ncirculate, the heats of summer can only penetrate very feebly. The ice\r\nonce formed in such cavities, only melts slowly; for one knows that ice\r\nin melting, absorbs 60° of heat; and where find this heat in an air\r\nalways very cold and nearly still? During a great cold, the ice forms\r\nwith great promptness, while it melts with much slowness, even when\r\nthe temperature of the air is several degrees above zero; what must\r\nthen not be this slowness when the temperature of the interior air only\r\nrises in summer one degree above freezing point. It would need several\r\nsummers to melt this ice if it did not reform each winter.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nC. A. Lee, in 1825, wrote that the ice in the Wolfshollow near\r\nSalisbury was a winter formation.\r\n\r\n\r\nG. Poulett Scrope, in 1826, accepted as the truth the statement that\r\nthe cave of Roth was filled with ice in summer, but that it was\r\nwarm during the winter. In 1827, he explained the presence of ice at\r\nPontgibaud as follows: \"The water is apparently frozen by means of the\r\npowerful evaporation produced by a current of very dry air issuing from\r\nsome long fissures or arched galleries which communicate with the cave,\r\nand owing its dryness to the absorbent qualities of the lava through\r\nwhich it passes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nF. Reich, in 1834, thought that there were two possible causes which\r\nmight produce subterranean ice: 1, the difference in specific gravity\r\nbetween warm and cold air; 2, evaporation. He thought the cold air a\r\nsufficient cause in most caves, but he considered that evaporation also\r\nplayed a part not infrequently.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Silliman, in 1839, gave the first hint, in the negative,\r\nabout compressed air as a cause for subterranean ice. He said about\r\nOwego that if one could suppose that compressed gases or a compressed\r\natmosphere were escaping from the water or near it, this would indicate\r\na source of cold, but that as there is no indication of this in the\r\nwater, the explanation is unavailable.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor A. Pleischl wrote in 1841 that he was told that ice formed on\r\nthe Pleschiwetz and on the Steinberge in summer. Continuing, he says:\r\n\"The author is therefore, as well as for other reasons, of the opinion,\r\nthat the ice is not remaining winter ice, but a summer formation, and\r\none formed by the cold of evaporation. * * * The basalt is, as a thick\r\nstone, a good conductor for the heat, and takes up therefore easily\r\nthe sun's warmth, but parts with it easily to other neighboring bodies.\r\nIn the hollows, between the basalt blocks, is found, as I already\r\nmentioned, rotting moss, which forms a spongy mass, which is wet\r\nthrough with water. The basalt heated by the sun's rays now causes a\r\npart of the water in the spongy mass to vaporize; for this evaporation\r\nthe water needs heat, which it withdraws from the neighboring bodies\r\nand in part from water, and makes the water so cold, that it freezes\r\ninto ice, as, under the bell of an air pump--Nature therefore makes\r\nhere a physical experiment on the largest scale.\"\r\n\r\nMuch stress appears to have been laid on the paper of Professor\r\nPleischl by Professor Krauss and one or two others. The weak point in\r\nit is that Pleischl did not see the ice form in summer, but was only,\r\nas usual, told that it did so. There is nothing in the facts given to\r\nshow that the places mentioned are different from any other taluses,\r\nwhere ice does not form as the result of heat.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. C. B. Hayden, in 1843, wrote about the Ice Mountain in Virginia,\r\nand held that the porous nature of the rocks makes them poor conductors\r\nof heat, and that the mountain is a huge sandstone refrigerator.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. S. Pearl Lathrop, in 1844, wrote of the Ice Bed at Wallingford,\r\nVermont, as a great natural refrigerator.\r\n\r\n\r\nSir Roderick Impey Murchison wrote in 1845 about the salt mine and\r\nfreezing cave of Illetzkaya-Zatschita. He visited them during a hot\r\nAugust, and was assured that the cold within is greatest when the\r\nexternal air is hottest and driest; that the fall of rain and a moist\r\natmosphere produce some diminution in the cold of the cave and that on\r\nthe setting in of winter the ice disappears entirely. He accepted these\r\nstatements evidently only in a half hearted way, submitting them to\r\nSir John Herschel, who tried to explain them, in case they were true,\r\nof which Herschel was likewise doubtful. Murchison at first thought\r\nthat the ice was due to the underlying bed of salt, but soon recognized\r\nthat this explanation could not be correct. He also rejected Herschel's\r\n\"heat and cold wave\" theory. Shortly after this he came across\r\nPictet's memoir, and on the strength of it concluded that the ice in\r\nIlletzkaya-Zatschita could not be the residue of a winter deposit, but\r\nmust be due to descending currents of air; to the previously wet and\r\ndamp roof affording a passage to water; and to the excessive dryness of\r\nthe external air of these southern steppes contributing powerfully to\r\nthe refrigerating effects of evaporation.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Arnold Guyot, in 1856, said that the well at Owego admitted\r\nlarge quantities of snow which melts, but not readily, because it\r\nis not accessible to the sun. It therefore goes through the same\r\nprocess as glaciers, of partly melting and refreezing; and we have the\r\nformation of a glacier without movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor W. B. Rogers, in 1856, held that the well at Owego became the\r\nrecipient of the coldest air of the neighborhood, and the temperature\r\nremained abnormal because the bad conducting power of the materials of\r\nthe well retained the cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor D. Olmstead, in 1856, held about Owego that cold air exists\r\nin the interior of the earth which may have found a ventilating shaft\r\nin the well.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Petruzzi, in 1857, considered the following requirements\r\nnecessary for a glacière: A high altitude above the sea; a decided drop\r\ninto the interior of the mountain; absence of all draught; protection\r\nagainst all warm and moist winds, therefore the opening to north and\r\neast. He also says about the glacière on the Pograca: that it is in\r\nshadow; that the thick forest round the mouth keeps the temperature\r\ndown; that it begins to freeze below when it does above; that the cold\r\nremains there into the spring; and that the water from rain or other\r\nsources, which flows into the cave, must freeze there, and the ice form\r\nin greater quantities than the heat of summer can melt away.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Albert D. Hager wrote in 1859: \"The question now arises, why it\r\nwas that such a congealed mass of earth was found in Brandon at the\r\ntime the frozen well was dug. My opinion is, that the bad conducting\r\nproperty of the solids surrounding it, the absence of ascending\r\ncurrents of heated air, and of subterranean streams of water in this\r\nparticular locality favored such a result; and that the bad conducting\r\nproperty of clay, as well as that of the porous gravel associated\r\nwith it, taken in connection with the highly inclined porous strata,\r\nand the disposition of heated air to rise, and the cold air to remain\r\nbelow, contribute to produce in the earth, at this place, a _mammoth\r\nrefrigerator_, embracing essentially the same principle as that\r\ninvolved in the justly celebrated refrigerator known as 'Winship's\r\nPatent.'\r\n\r\n\"Clay is not only nearly impervious to air and water, but it is one of\r\nthe worst conductors of heat in nature. (Note.--To test the question\r\nwhether clay was a poor conductor of heat or not, I took two basins\r\nof equal size, and in one put a coating of clay one-half inch thick,\r\ninto which I put water of a temperature of 52° Fahrenheit. Into the\r\nother dish, which was clean, I put water of the same temperature, and\r\nsubjected the two basins to equal amounts of heat; and in five minutes\r\nthe water in the clean dish indicated a temperature of 70° while that\r\nof the one coated with clay was raised only to 56°.) If we can rely\r\nupon the statements of those who dug out the frozen earth, it rested\r\nupon a stratum of clay that lay upon the bed of pebbles in which the\r\nwater was found, for it was described as being a very sticky kind of\r\nhard pan.\r\n\r\n\"This being the case, if the water contained in the pebbly mass had a\r\ntemperature above the freezing point, the heat would be but imperfectly\r\ntransmitted to the frost, through the clay, provided there was no other\r\nway for its escape. But we have seen that the stratum of clay that\r\noverlays the bed of pebbles in the side of the gravel pit was not\r\nhorizontal, but inclined towards the well at an angle of 25°. Now if\r\nthis drip was continued to the well, and existed there (which is highly\r\nprobable), it will be seen that the ascending current of heated air, in\r\nthe pebbly bed, would be checked upon meeting the overlying barrier of\r\nclay and be deflected out of its upward course. The tendency of heated\r\nair is to rise, hence it would continue its course along the under\r\nside of the clay, through the interstices in the bed of pebbles, till\r\nit found a place of escape at the surface, which in this case may have\r\nbeen at the gravel pit before named.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Edward Hitchcock wrote in 1861: \"The presence of a mass of\r\nfrozen gravel deep beneath the surface in Brandon, was first made known\r\nby digging a well in it in the autumn of 1858. * * * The gravel, also,\r\nrises into occasional knolls and ridges. In short, it is just such\r\na region of sand and gravel as may be seen in many places along the\r\nwestern side of the Green Mountains; and indeed, all over New England.\r\nIt is what we call modified drift, and lies above genuine drift, having\r\nbeen the result of aqueous agency subsequent to the drift period. * *\r\n* The well was stoned up late in the autumn of 1858, and during the\r\nwinter, ice formed upon the water in one night, two inches thick. It\r\ncontinued to freeze till April; after which no ice was formed on the\r\nsurface, but we can testify that as late as June 25th, the stones of\r\nthe well for four or five feet above the surface of the water were\r\nmostly coated with ice; nay, it had not wholly disappeared July 14th.\r\nThe temperature of the water was only one degree of Fahrenheit above\r\nfreezing point. The ice did however disappear in the autumn but was\r\nformed again (how early we did not learn) in the winter, and so thick\r\ntoo that it was necessary to send some one into the well to break it.\r\nWe visited the well August 18th, 1860, and found the temperature 42°.\r\nYet only the week previous ice was seen upon the stones, and we were\r\neven told by one of the family, that a piece of ice had been drawn up\r\nthe day before in the bucket. * * * These frozen deposits may have been\r\nproduced during the glacial period that accompanied the formation of\r\ndrift, and continued far down into the subsequent epochs of modified\r\ndrift. * * * But in all the excavations both gravel and clay occur:\r\nand how almost impervious to heat must such a coating 20 feet thick,\r\nbe! It would not, however, completely protect the subjacent mass from\r\nsolar heat. But there is another agency still more powerful for this\r\nend, namely, evaporation, which we think has operated here, as we shall\r\nmore fully describe further on; and we think that these two agencies,\r\nnamely, non-conduction and evaporation, may have preserved this frozen\r\ndeposit for a very long period, from exterior influences.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Thury in 1861 says about Saint-Georges: \"Such is the\r\n_résumé_, concise but exact, of the results of our winter excursion.\r\nThey furnish proof to the fact generally borne witness to by the\r\nmountaineers, that ice does not form in winter in the interior of\r\ncaverns. But if this is so, it is for a very simple reason: two things\r\nare necessary for the formation of ice: cold and water. In winter, the\r\ncold is not wanting: but if there is no spring opening in the cave, the\r\nwater is absent, and then no ice forms.\r\n\r\n\"It is in the spring, at the time of the first melting of the snows,\r\nthat the ice must form. Then water at 0° pours over the surface, and\r\npenetrates by the fissures of the rock and by the large openings into\r\nthe chilled cavern, which is also receiving the freezing air of the\r\nnights. The grotto then makes its annual provision of ice, which after\r\nthis could only diminish little by little during the whole duration of\r\nthe warm season.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Thury writes about the Grand Cave de Montarquis: \"Here it\r\nmust be when water and cold meet, that is autumn and especially spring,\r\nthe time of the first melting of the snows.\"\r\n\r\n\"During the winter * * * the colder, heavier air comes to freeze the\r\nwater of the grotto, and chill the ice and the wall of rock.\"\r\n\r\n\"During the summer, the radiation of the vaults and the proper heat of\r\nthe ground only melt a small quantity of ice because this absorbs much\r\nheat to pass into a liquid state.\"\r\n\r\n\"The heat of the air is entirely used to melt the ice; it does not\r\ntherefore manifest itself as sensible heat.\"\r\n\r\n\"The contact of the ice ready to melt, plays in a certain way, towards\r\nthe air a little warmer than itself, the rôle of an extremely absorbing\r\nbody, or one which has an excessive caloric conductibility.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here the formation of the ice could not possibly be attributed to the\r\ncold caused by evaporation. The psychrometer indicated ninety-two per\r\ncent, of relative humidity: the atmosphere of the grotto was therefore\r\nalmost saturated with evaporation of water, and the maximum of cold\r\ncaused by evaporation was not over half a degree centigrade.\"\r\n\r\nAbout prismatic ice and a hollow pyramid, he says: \"The prismatic\r\n(_aréolaire_) structure is produced later on in the ice, by a new and\r\nparticular arrangement of the molecules of the already solidified\r\nwater. Therefore the recent stalactites are never crystallized.\"\r\n\r\n\"In the beginning of the hot season, the atmospheric temperature of\r\nthe grotto rises slowly. Inferior to zero by some tenths of a degree,\r\nit produces first on the surface, in the stalactites, the prismatic\r\nstructure. The temperature continues to rise, the central portions\r\nof the stalactites, still composed of ordinary ice, liquefy, and if\r\nthe melting water finds some issue, either by accidental openings\r\nleft between some prisms, or by the extremity of the stalactite or by\r\nsome point of its surface which had escaped the action of the regular\r\ncrystallization; by this opening the water escapes, and the tubular\r\nstalactite has been formed.\"\r\n\r\n\"The column was composed of a very special ice, perfectly dry,\r\nperfectly homogeneous, translucid and whose appearance could only\r\nbe compared to that of the most beautiful porcelain. I am inclined\r\nto believe that we had under our eyes a special molecular state of\r\ncongealed water. This state would be produced under the influence of\r\na constant temperature of a certain degree (Note--perhaps not far from\r\n4°--the actual temperature of the grotto) long prolonged. These causes\r\ncan be realized more completely in glacières than anywheres else.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Reverend George Forrest Browne, published in 1865, _Ice Caves in\r\nFrance and Switzerland_, one of the most delightful books of travel\r\never written, on account of the scientific accuracy and the humor of\r\nthe author. He visited La Genollière, Saint-Georges, Saint-Livres,\r\nChaux-les-Passavant, Monthézy, Arc-sous-Çicon, the Schafloch,\r\nHaut-d'Aviernoz, which he calls Grand Anu, Chapuis, and Font-d'Urle.\r\nHe says: \"The view which Deluc adopted was one which I have myself\r\nindependently formed. * * * The heavy cold air of winter sinks down\r\ninto the glacières, and the lighter warm air of summer cannot on\r\nordinary principles of gravitation dislodge it, so that heat is very\r\nslowly spread in the caves; and even when some amount of heat does\r\nreach the ice, the latter melts but slowly, for ice absorbs 60° C.\r\nof heat in melting; and thus, when ice is once formed, it becomes a\r\nmaterial guarantee for the permanence of cold in the cave. For this\r\nexplanation to hold good it is necessary that the level at which the\r\nice is formed should be below the level of the entrance to the cave;\r\notherwise the mere weight of the cold air would cause it to leave its\r\nprison as soon as the spring warmth arrived. In every single case that\r\nhas come under my observation, this condition has been emphatically\r\nfulfilled. It is necessary, also, that the cave should be protected\r\nfrom direct radiation, as the gravitation of cold air has nothing to\r\ndo with resistance to that powerful means of introducing heat. This\r\ncondition, also, is fulfilled by nature in all the glacières I have\r\nvisited, excepting that of S. Georges; and there art has replaced the\r\nprotection formerly afforded by the thick trees which grew over the\r\nhole of entrance. The effect of the second hole in the roof of this\r\nglacière is to destroy all the ice which is within range of the sun.\r\nA third and very necessary condition is, that the wind should not be\r\nallowed access to the cave; for if it were, it would infallibly bring\r\nin heated air, in spite of the specific weight of the cold air stored\r\nwithin. It will be understood from my description of such glacières as\r\nthat of the Grand Anu, of Monthézy, and the lower glacière of the Pré\r\nde S. Livres, how completely sheltered from all winds the entrances to\r\nthose caves are. There can be no doubt, too, that the large surfaces\r\nwhich are available for evaporation have much to do with maintaining a\r\nsomewhat lower temperature than the mean temperature of the place where\r\nthe cave occurs.\"\r\n\r\nBrowne noticed prismatic ice several times. He says of it: \"M. Thury\r\nsuggests also, as a possibility, what I have found to be the case by\r\nfrequent observations, that the prismatic ice has greater power of\r\nresisting heat than ordinary ice. * * * A Frenchman who was present\r\nin the room in which the Chemical Section of the British Association\r\nmet at Bath, and heard a paper which I read there on this prismatic\r\nstructure, suggested that it was probably something akin to the\r\nrhomboidal form assumed by dried mud; and I have since been struck by\r\nthe great resemblance to it, as far as the surface goes, which the pits\r\nof mud left by the coprolite workers near Cambridge offer, of course\r\non a very large scale. This led me to suppose that the intense dryness\r\nwhich would naturally be the result of the action of some weeks or\r\nmonths of great cold upon subterranean ice might be one of the causes\r\nof its assuming this form, and the observations at Jena would rather\r\nconfirm than contradict this view: competent authorities, however, seem\r\ninclined to believe that warmth, and not cold, is the producing cause.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Browne found a hollow cone at La Genollière, for which he accounted\r\nas follows: \"In the loftier part of the cave * * * ninety six drops\r\nof water in a minute splashed on to a small stone immediately under\r\nthe main fissure. This stone was in the centre of a considerable area\r\nof the floor which was clear of ice. * * * I found that the edge\r\nof the ice round this clear area was much thicker than the rest of\r\nthe ice on the floor, and was evidently the remains of the swelling\r\npedestal of the column. * * * When the melted snows of spring send\r\ndown to the cave, through the fissures of the rock, an abundance of\r\nwater at a very low temperature and the cave itself is stored with the\r\nwinter's cold, these thicker rings of ice catch first the descending\r\nwater, and so a circular wall, naturally conical, is formed around the\r\narea of stones; the remaining water either running off through the\r\ninterstices, or forming a floor of ice of less thickness, which yields\r\nto the next summer's drops. In the course of time, this conical wall\r\nrises, narrowing always, till a dome-like roof is at length formed and\r\nthenceforth the column is solid.\" From what I have observed myself,\r\nthis explanation seems to fairly meet the facts.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor T. G. Bonney, in 1868, was inclined to believe that there was\r\nsome connection between glacières and a glacial period.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. W. R. Raymond, in 1869, concluded from his own observations about\r\nthe lava cave in Washington: that the cold air of winter freezes up the\r\npercolating waters from the surface, layer upon layer, solid from the\r\nbottom, and the accumulated ice thaws slowly in summer, being retarded\r\nby the covering which keeps out the direct rays of the sun, and by the\r\nfact that the melting ice at one end of the cave, through which the\r\nsummer draught enters, itself refrigerates the air and maintains a\r\nfreezing temperature at the other end.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. C. A. White, in 1870, says of the cavern at Decorah: \"The formation\r\nof the ice is probably due to the rapid evaporation of the moisture\r\nof the earth and rocks, caused by the heat of the summer sun upon the\r\nouter wall of the fissure and valley side. This outer wall is from ten\r\nto twenty feet in thickness where the ice was seen to be most abundant.\r\nThe water for its production seems to be supplied by slow exudation\r\nfrom the inner wall of the cave.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Krenner, in 1874, wrote of Dóbsina as \"a natural ice cellar of\r\ngiant dimensions, whose ice masses formed in winter, the summer does\r\nnot succeed in melting.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor W. Boyd Dawkins wrote in 1874: \"The apparent anomaly that one\r\nonly out of a group of caves exposed to the same temperature should\r\nbe a glacière, may be explained by the fact that these conditions\r\n[those formulated by the Rev. G. F. Browne] are found in combination\r\nbut rarely, and if one were absent there would be no accumulation of\r\nperpetual ice. It is very probable that the store of cold laid up in\r\nthese caves, as in an ice house, has been ultimately derived from the\r\ngreat refrigeration of climate in Europe in the Glacial Period.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Theodore Kirchhoff examined the lava caves in the State of\r\nWashington and in 1876 wrote that he considered that the ice in the\r\nsmaller ones were simply remains of the winter's cold. He thought\r\nthat the ice in the large cave where there is a draught could not be\r\naccounted for in the same way, so he concluded that the ice must be due\r\nto the draught.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. N. M. Lowe, in 1879, proposed the Compressed Air or Capillary\r\ntheory[74] about the Cave at Decorah.\r\n\r\n[74] See Part II., page 142.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. John Ritchie, Jr., in 1879, gave an exceedingly clear exposition of\r\nthe theory in the same journal.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Aden S. Benedict, in 1881, published his observations about\r\nDecorah. He found that there was no water falling in the cave to\r\ncompress the air, that there was no water falling near enough to be\r\nheard, nor any aperture giving vent to cold air in the cave. He thought\r\nthat the cold of winter cools the sides of the cave several degrees\r\nbelow freezing point and that these rocks are so far underground that\r\nit would take a long season of hot weather to raise this temperature to\r\nthe melting point of ice. In the spring the water percolates through\r\nthe soil and drips on to the yet freezing rocks; on which it freezes\r\nand remains until the heat of summer penetrates to a sufficient depth\r\nto melt it away. The rocks once raised above 0° remain so until the\r\nfollowing winter and consequently if there are heavy autumn rains there\r\nis water on the rocks but no ice. Mr. Benedict concluded that there was\r\nnothing more mysterious about Decorah than the fact that if you drop\r\nwater on a cold stone it will freeze.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Friederich Umlauft in 1883 wrote about glacières \"that as\r\nmoreover they were generally protected against warm winds and strong\r\ndraughts and as their entrances look towards the north or east, there\r\nis consequently more ice formed under these conditions in winter than\r\ncan melt away in summer. Other ice grottoes however show the remarkable\r\ncharacteristic, that it is warm in them in winter, in the summer on the\r\ncontrary it becomes so cold that all the dripping water freezes. They\r\nare found near snow clefts and gorges; when in the hot summer months\r\nthe snow melts, then the cold which has become free presses down the\r\ntemperature in the cave so much that the water freezes into ice. Such\r\ngrottoes are in Austria at * * * Frauenmauer, * * * Brandstein, * * *\r\nTeplitz, * * * Scilize, * * * Dobschauer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nHerr Körber in 1885 wrote about the Schafloch, that the stored-up\r\nwinter's cold stands out as permanent adversary of the higher\r\ntemperature of the earth. The thermometer proved this by its action at\r\nthe end of the cave in a rock cleft, which is warmer than the rest of\r\nthe cave. In September Herr Körber found the masses of ice less and\r\nthe stalagmites smaller than in January, especially a column which in\r\nJanuary had become a stately mountain of transparent ice.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Eberhard Fugger of Salzburg, has studied the caves of the\r\nUntersberg carefully, having paid over eighty visits to them. He\r\nclassifies freezing caverns into the following types, according to\r\ntheir position and their shape:\r\n\r\nAccording to position: 1, open caves, that is those whose entrance is\r\nfree on a rock wall; 2, pit caves, where the entrance is at the bottom\r\nof a pit; 3, pit caves, where the pit is covered and the opening is in\r\nthe roof.\r\n\r\nAccording to shape: 1, _sackhöhlen_ or chamber caverns, into which one\r\nenters immediately at the entrance; 2, _ganghöhlen_, or passage caves\r\nterminating in a chamber; 3, _röhrenhöhlen_, or passage caves where\r\nthe passages continue further than the chamber.\r\n\r\nHe is a strong advocate of the winter's cold theory. He says: \"The ice\r\nof caves is formed by the cold of winter, and remains despite the heat\r\nof summer, as through local circumstances the quantity of heat brought\r\nto the ice is not great enough to melt it by the time when ice and snow\r\nin the open at the same altitude have already disappeared.\"\r\n\r\n\"In order that ice may form in a cave in winter, two factors are\r\nnecessary. There must be water present in some form or other, and in\r\nsome way the outside cold air must be able to sink into the cave.\"\r\n\r\n\"When the bottom of a cave is below the entrance, the outside cold\r\nwinter air sinks into the cave from its weight, when the temperature of\r\nthe cave air is higher than that of the outside air; and it will remain\r\nthere during the warmer weather, as the warm outside air on account of\r\nits lighter weight cannot drive out the cold heavy cave air.\"\r\n\r\n\"The most important factor for the formation of ice is the drip water.\r\nThe more drip flows into a cave during the cold season, the more ice is\r\nformed; the more drip, on the contrary, flows into the cave during the\r\nwarm season, the more ice is destroyed.\"\r\n\r\n\"The warmth, which the roof of the cave gives out, is also a cause\r\nwhich helps to melt the ice, and a cause in fact which works the\r\nharder, the higher the temperature of the roof and the dirtier the ice\r\nfloor.\"\r\n\r\n\"If direct rays of the sun penetrate a cave, they scarcely warm up the\r\nair which they traverse, but they raise the temperature of the floor\r\nor of the walls, which they touch. They are therefore a very important\r\nfactor, which may bring about the melting of the ice.\"\r\n\r\n\"The snow slope at the mouth of a cave offers some protection against\r\nthe rays of the sun, especially if it is no longer white, but covered\r\nwith all sorts of dirt.\"\r\n\r\n\"The larger the mass of ice, the longer is its duration.\" \"A certain\r\nthickness to the roof is of importance in preserving the ice. If it\r\nis less than 8 meters, then it is well if it is covered with outside\r\nvegetation.\"\r\n\r\nI entirely agree with these _dicta_ of Professor Fugger.\r\n\r\nIn 1893, Fugger writes: \"The peculiar readings of temperature, which\r\nI made in August 1877, in the Kolowratshöhle, namely on the 13th at\r\n12 M., 0.5°, on the 15th at 4 P. M., 0.35°, on the 23d at 10 A. M.,\r\n0.12°, on the 26th at 10 A. M., 0.17°, and on the 30th at 2.15 P.\r\nM., -0.10°, I think I can attribute to the workings of the winds. In\r\nthe observations themselves there could scarce be an error. All five\r\nobservations were made at the same place, with the same thermometer,\r\nafter at least half an hour's exposure. In the time from the 13th to\r\nthe 30th of August, the temperature minimum in the town of Salzburg,\r\nwas 12°; before the 30th were several cloudless nights. During the\r\nwhole of August scarcely any but southeast and northwest winds were\r\nblowing. The Kolowratshöhle opens in a rock wall to the east; the above\r\nnamed winds therefore affected during the entire month the entrance\r\nto the cave and may have produced a lively evaporation in the cave,\r\nthrough a sort of sucking up of the cave air, and thus have created the\r\nrather decided cooling off of 0.6° within seventeen days.\"\r\n\r\nThis statement, coming from Professor Fugger, deserves particular\r\nattention, because it would go to show: first, that the air in\r\nthe Kolowratshöhle, a _sackhöhle_ with only one entrance, is only\r\napparently stagnant in summer and not really so; and second, that\r\nevaporation may act to a limited extent in a cavern where there is\r\nalmost no running water.\r\n\r\n\r\nCaptain Trouillet, in 1885, published a paper about\r\nChaux-les-Passavant. He found that when it was colder inside than\r\noutside, the internal air was nearly cut off from the outside; when it\r\nwas coldest outside there was a lively disturbance. He called these\r\ntwo classes _périodes fermées_ and _périodes ouvertes_. He says:\r\n\"The duration of a _closed period_ is measured then on the curves\r\n[of a maximum and minimum thermometer] of the interior temperatures,\r\nbetween a minimum and the following maximum; that of an _open period_\r\nis between a minimum and the preceding maximum. One can thus count\r\nfrom the 25th November to the 31st December 25 _open periods_ of a\r\ntotal duration of 200 hours or 8 times 24 hours: which gives for each\r\na duration of 7½ hours. The shortest lasted 2 hours and the longest\r\n16 hours. During the same interval, the _closed periods_ numbered 26,\r\nmaking a total duration of about 28 days; the longest, which lasted\r\nfrom the 3d to the 8th December, was 126 hours long.\"\r\n\r\nTrouillet also says: \"From the 23d to the 30th December, the grotto\r\nwas completely isolated from the external air, and yet during three\r\nconsecutive nights, the interior had three marked chills. Such is\r\nthe phenomenon whose cause can only lay, in our opinion, in the\r\nintroduction of the dry air driven to the cave by the winds between\r\nnorth and east. This air on entering comes in contact with the ice\r\nand the humid roof of the cave; it saturates itself in producing a\r\nformation of vapors, and therefrom a consumption of heat which may be\r\nconsiderable.\"\r\n\r\nThere are some discrepancies in this last paragraph which must be\r\nnoted, for the reason that Trouillet's observations are so valuable. He\r\ndoes not mention having seen the vapors himself, in fact the production\r\nof these vapors seems only an inference. Nor is it easy to understand\r\nhow the grotto could be \"completely isolated from the external air\" if\r\nthe phenomenon lay \"in the introduction of the dry air driven to the\r\ncave by the winds north and east.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. B. Schwalbe, in 1886, wrote that \"all my observations point to\r\nthe fact that the rock is the cooling factor in summer, and that the\r\ncold goes out from it.\" He says also that \"when I saw for the first\r\ntime the little cave of Roth, which was filled with fairly numerous\r\nice formations, it was precisely the smallness of the volume of air\r\nand the strange appearance of the ice which made the simple cold air\r\ntheory seen insufficient, nor could I later, by widening the theory and\r\nobserving the localities from the basis of DeLuc's theory, accept it.\r\nIt always seemed by all my observations that in the rock there must be\r\na lasting source of cold. There must be a cause present, which prevents\r\nthe rapid warming of the cave wall through the temperature of the\r\nground, which also keeps the stone cool in summer and induces the main\r\nice formation in the spring.\" He also hints that Mr. Lowe's compressed\r\nair theory may be the correct one. Dr. Schwalbe's work, _Über Eishöhlen\r\nund Eislöcher_, is one of the four or five most important contributions\r\nto glacière literature, and his opinion is entitled to great respect on\r\naccount of his many observations.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Israel C. Russell wrote in 1890, about the ice beds on the\r\nYukon: \"It is thought by some observers, to be an inheritance from a\r\nformer period of extreme cold; but under existing climatic conditions,\r\nwhen ice forms beneath a layer of moss, it is preserved during the\r\nshort summer, and may increase as it does on the tundras, to an\r\nastonishing thickness.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1897, Professor Russell says: \"It is not probable that all the\r\nsubsoil ice of northern regions has been formed in one way. Along the\r\nflood plains and on the deltas of rivers where layers of clear ice are\r\ninterbedded with sheets of frozen gravel and vegetable matter, as is\r\nfrequently the case, it seems evident that the growth of the deposit is\r\ndue, in some instances, to the flooding of previously frozen layers,\r\nand the freezing and subsequent burial of the sediment thus added to\r\ntheir surfaces. When spring freshets spread out sheets of débris over\r\nthe flood plain of a river, as frequently happens when streams in high\r\nlatitudes flow northward, the previously frozen soil and the ice of\r\nponds and swamps may be buried and indefinitely preserved.\" \"There is\r\nstill another process by which frozen subsoil may be formed in high\r\nlatitudes: this is, the effects of the cold during the long winters\r\nare not counteracted by the heat during the short summers. Under the\r\nconditions now prevailing in northern Alaska, where the mean annual\r\ntemperature is below 32° Fahrenheit, the frozen layer tends to increase\r\nthe thickness from year to year just as the depth of frozen soil in\r\nmore temperate latitudes may increase from month to month during the\r\nwinter season. During the short northern summers, especially where the\r\nground is moss covered, melting only extends a few inches below the\r\nsurface.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMons. E. A. Martel, in 1892, wrote of the Creux-Percé: \"I incline\r\nonly, as in all the pits which narrow at the bottom (_avens à\r\nrétrécissement_) to attribute the chilling to the fall of the cold\r\nair of winter and to its non-renewal in summer.\" And at page 564 of\r\n_Les Abimes_ he says: \"One knows that _evaporation_ is an active cause\r\nof cooling; therefore it is always cooler in caves near the drips of\r\nwater. * * * I have positively noted this influence of evaporation\r\nnear the drips of Tabourel (8° instead of 9.5°), of Dargilan, of the\r\nCerna Jama, and in abysses with double mouths where there were strong\r\ndraughts (Rabanel, Biau, Fosse-Mobile, etc.).\" In December, 1897,\r\nMons. Martel writes: \"In short, the action of the winter's cold is\r\nthe real cause accepted by * * * and recently confirmed by Fugger,\r\nTrouillet and Martel.\" And also: \"It is probable that this influence\r\n[evaporation] is only real at rather high altitudes; this is at least\r\nwhat seems the result of the studies of the caves of Naye (1700 to 1900\r\nmeters) begun by Professor Dutoit.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1899, Mons. Martel gave an account of the Glacière de Naye. In this\r\npaper, he abandons definitely fossil ice, salts and the capillary\r\ntheory as possible causes of underground ice. He considers that there\r\nare four causes: 1, shape of the cavity; 2, free access of snow in\r\nwinter; 3, high altitude; 4, evaporation due to wind currents. The last\r\ntwo causes he thinks are not necessarily always present. For instance\r\nhe considers that, at the Creux-Percé, and at Chaux-les-Passavant, the\r\nice is due especially to the sack or hour-glass shape of these hollows\r\nwhere the summer air cannot get in on account of its lightness. At the\r\nGlacière de Naye, which is a big windhole, situated at an altitude of\r\n1750 to 1820 meters, Mons. Martel thinks that the ice is formed by the\r\nsnow and cold of winter, but that its preservation is assured by the\r\nevaporation caused by the action of the windhole.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Terlanday, in 1893, asserted that ice does not form in Szilize in\r\nwinter, and that the ice first forms in the winter in the upper part\r\nof rock fissures and that in the spring, at the time of an increase of\r\ntemperature, this fissure ice is brought to the melting point by the\r\nsuccessive entering of heat into the earth and that it then arrives at\r\nthe cave, where it aids the formation of icicles. This theory about\r\nfissure ice is probably in so far correct, that the ice in the upper\r\nparts of fissures, near the surface of the ground, melts before the ice\r\nin the lower parts of fissures. The drip would then naturally run into\r\nthe cave and, as long as the temperature of the cave was low, help to\r\nform cave ice.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Hans Lohmann, in 1895, published some valuable notes about several\r\nglacières. While considering the cold of winter as the main cause of\r\nthe ice, he thought evaporation a secondary cause of cold. He says:\r\n\"That the cold from evaporation bears its share in cooling a cave,\r\nwill not be denied. * * * The air saturated with aqueous vapor makes\r\none think of constant evaporation. The aqueous vapor spreads itself\r\nby diffusion throughout the entire cave, and if the outside air is\r\ndriest, goes to that. Through this, more ice and water can always be\r\nvaporized, and to the warming elements there is furnished a cooling\r\none. If dry winds get into the cave, then must evaporation be very\r\nlively and the chilling especially strong. Through this cause alone\r\ncan be explained the remarkably low temperature of +6.3° in the new\r\npart of the Garischen Stollen, in contrast to the temperature of +7.9°\r\nin the old part. The strong draught in the last drew out through its\r\nsuction the damp air of the new adit, so that there had to be a strong\r\nevaporation.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Lohmann gives some exhaustive notes about prismatic ice. He found\r\nit a product of the fall months. He thinks all the observations show\r\nthat \"the beginning of all prismatic formation in the ice may be looked\r\nfor in the changes of temperature in the cave at the time of the\r\nformation of the ice. These cause the everywhere recognized splitting,\r\nvertically to the outer surface. The further development hangs, as\r\nshown by Hagenbach and Emden, on the attempt of the neighboring cells,\r\nto join into larger unities. The increase of the larger crystals is\r\nfinally prevented by the melting out of the openings between the\r\nseparate crystals. Through this may be explained the difference in the\r\nprismatic ice in different parts of the same cave.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nRegierungsrath Franz Kraus, in 1895, wrote a short essay on glacières\r\nin _Höhlenkunde_. He seems to have seen but few glacières himself, and\r\nconsiders the scientific side of the question by no means solved as\r\nyet. He says: \"The last word will not be spoken by the geographers and\r\nthe Alpine climbers * * * but by the physicists, in whose field both\r\nquestions really belong. Only then, when the physical circumstances\r\nof the formation of the ice in glacières have been so thoroughly\r\nunderstood, that under the same circumstances it may be possible to\r\nbuild artificial glacières, only then could one say: the glacière\r\nquestion is definitely settled. The best proof is always experiment.\"\r\n\r\nHe lays down several dicta which he says are universally recognized,\r\namong which is this: \"2. The ice formations in the débris heaps of\r\nbasaltic mountains are summer ice formations. The evaporation of the\r\ninfiltration water is recognized on all sides as the cause of this\r\nice.\" I differ in opinion from Herr Kraus about this matter, and think\r\nthat, on the contrary, every proof shows that the ice of basaltic\r\ntaluses is not a summer formation and is not due to evaporation.\r\n\r\nHerr Kraus also says: \"The _Eishöhlen_ resemble so little the\r\n_Windröhren_, that for these a proper name is quite correct. Just\r\nas one cannot draw a sharp line between _Einstürzschlünden_ and\r\n_Einstürzdolinen_, so one cannot draw a sharp line between _eishöhlen_\r\nand _windröhren_. A stagnation of cave air does not exist, and no cave\r\nstudent would pretend to say it existed. The circulation of air may in\r\ncertain caves take place almost entirely through the mouth and it then\r\ndepends largely on the shape of the latter; in other caves are crevices\r\nand erosion holes, which allow a circulation of air. Again in other\r\ncaves air may come through the floor into the cave, as is proved by\r\ncertain places always remaining free from ice.\"\r\n\r\nHe also says: \"The formation of dripstone is also diminished about\r\nthick roofs, when the cracks are too broad to permit a slow dripping\r\nprocess. In caves with sufficient air movements, that is ventilation,\r\nthe dripstone formation takes place faster than in those in which\r\nthe air is only slowly renewed. Also in such caves, in which the air\r\nis strongly filled with moisture, the dripstone formation process\r\nis materially hindered. Therefore in water caves and in _eishöhlen_\r\none finds only rarely dripstone formations, and these mainly of poor\r\nappearance. But in all cases the carbonic acid of the infiltration\r\nwater plays an important part.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1896, a Western newspaper published the following explanation about\r\nthe presence of ice in the cave at Elkinsville, Indiana; and it shows\r\nhow the idea--long since exploded--of the ice being due to chemical\r\ncauses, serenely bobs up on the discovery of a new cave: \"Some have\r\nadvanced the theory that the air is forced through under passages\r\nof the earth with such pressure as to make the strange formation;\r\nsome have attributed the cause to an underlying bed of alkali, whose\r\nchemical change to a gaseous form has produced the phenomenon. Others\r\nhave thought that the interior heat of the earth, acting upon the\r\niron pyrites, or fool's gold, which largely abounds in this country,\r\nis the true source of this unparalleled discovery. Still others think\r\nthat the sudden expansion of the carbonic acid gas given off by the\r\nheated limestone, which is also common in this country, could have\r\neasily produced the ice. But thus far the theories are nothing more\r\nthan speculation, and further than the fact that the ice cave exists,\r\nand is, indeed, a remarkable phenomenon, none has been able to further\r\ndetermine.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1896, Dr. A. Cvijic wrote that the cold air of winter is the source\r\nof cold in the glacières of Servia. The mountains have so little water\r\nthat the shepherds constantly take the ice out in summer for their own\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1897, numerous newspapers, among others, the _Philadelphia Press_\r\nof August 1st, romanced as follows about the cave at Decorah: \"In the\r\nsummer its temperature is far below freezing. * * * From some unknown\r\nsource in the impenetrable rear of the cave comes a blast of cold air\r\nas chill as from the Arctic region. In the winter the temperature of\r\nthe cave is like summer. * * * We followed the winding passage in and\r\nout for more than 1000 feet. * * * I took out the thermometer and laid\r\nit upon the floor of the cavern for three minutes. When I took it up\r\nagain I found that the mercury had fallen to 5 degrees below zero.\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it that causes this phenomenon? Scientific men are said to\r\nhave visited the cave within the last day or two who have declared that\r\nit had in some manner a subterranean connection with the polar regions,\r\nand that the cold air from the North coming in contact with the warm\r\nmoist atmosphere from outside converted the vapor into water on the\r\nwalls of the cavern where it straightway congealed. * * * It seems to\r\nme possible after thinking the matter over carefully, that in some\r\nmysterious manner the same influences that work the changes in climate\r\nin the Arctic and Antarctic regions are operating in this cave. It is\r\na well-known fact that in the regions referred to the seasons are the\r\nreverse of what they are here.\"\r\n\r\nMr. W. S. Auchincloss writes in 1897: \"We also notice the working of\r\nthe same principle during summer days. The hottest part does not occur\r\nat the noon hour--when the sun is on the meridian--but several hours\r\nlater in the afternoon. In this case the accessions of heat arrive more\r\nrapidly than radiation is able to carry off. Radiation, however, keeps\r\non apace, and, at last attaining the mastery, temperature falls. Ice\r\ncaves furnish another example of the gradual procession in the seasons.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Alois F. Kovarik writes about Decorah in 1898 that \"the length of\r\nduration of the ice in the cave during the spring and summer depends\r\nupon the quantity of cold stored up in the walls and this again upon\r\nthe coldness and the length of coldness of the previous winter. If\r\nthe winter be severe and long, the walls will store up a great supply\r\nof cold for the gradual dissipation in the spring and summer and\r\nconsequently the phenomenon of the ice in the ice chambers will last\r\nlonger. Last winter, with an exception of the fore part of December,\r\nwas quite mild. As a result, the ice began to disappear with the latter\r\npart of June, and totally disappeared by the end of July. * * * The\r\ntime of the lowest temperature in the cave depends upon how soon the\r\ncold spells of the winter begin; for the sooner the walls begin to\r\nfreeze to a greater depth, the sooner have they stored up the greatest\r\namount of cold. * * * February 28th, 1898, when the walls contained\r\nthe greatest amount of cold, there was no ice in the cave, for the\r\nreason that no water made appearance. Could water have appeared, no\r\ndoubt a great amount of ice would have formed; but as the conditions\r\nare, the water has to come from the ground outside, and this being\r\nfrozen at the time, water could not in any natural way appear. If in\r\nearly spring, sufficiently warm days should come to melt the snow and\r\nopen the ground, the water not taken up by the ground would flow and\r\nseep through crevices into the cave and ice consequently would appear\r\nearly. Somewhat such conditions prevailed this year, for warm days\r\nappeared quite early in the spring. If _per contra_ the ground does not\r\nopen until in April, as was the case in 1895 and 1896, the appearance\r\nof the ice is consequently delayed. * * * Naturally this opening [the\r\nentrance] was small, but to give easier entrance, it was enlarged to\r\nits present size. * * * If the entrance had been left a small opening,\r\nas it naturally was, it is my belief that the temperature of the\r\ninterior of the cave would be lower in summer than it is, and the ice\r\nwould not disappear as soon as it does.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Butler, of San José, Cal., investigated the question of cold\r\nair draughts coming from the glacière cave and from the freezing shaft\r\nhe examined in Montana. He wrote to me, in 1898, that he found that one\r\nnotices or imagines to notice a draught of air, especially on hot days.\r\nRapidly walking into the cave from the hot air without to the rapidly\r\ncooling air within produces the same nervous sensations as though one\r\nwere to remain stationary and the air were to pass by from the warm to\r\nthe colder portions. A distance of twelve meters finds a difference\r\nin temperature of fifteen degrees Centigrade. Twelve meters can be\r\nwalked quickly, so quickly that the nerves cannot become accustomed\r\ngradually to the change of temperature. The rapidly cooling air does\r\nactually produce the sensation of cool air passing by one's face. It\r\nproduces somewhat the same sensation as the evaporation of ether on\r\nthe surface of the body. Mr. Butler satisfied himself that as far as\r\nhe had observed all the seemingly peculiar conditions and places where\r\nthe ice has been found do not indicate any other causes when carefully\r\ninvestigated than those of the seasons of the year, and that the ice\r\nwas formed by no other cause than the natural cold of winter.\r\n\r\n\r\nProfessor Cranmer, in 1899, added some important contributions to our\r\nknowledge of freezing caverns. All his work goes to prove the winter's\r\ncold theory, but he has brought out some new details. He found warm and\r\ncold periods in the Tablerloch during the winter months. The coldest\r\nair sank to the bottom and the air in the cave stratified itself\r\naccording to its specific gravity and its temperature. During a cold\r\nperiod, the outside air sank into the cave only to the air stratum,\r\nwhose temperature, from the preceding warm period, was as much higher\r\nas that of the outer air, as this had become warmer in sinking to that\r\nstratum. The air which enters falls down the slope and displaces an\r\nequal volume of air which streams out under the roof.\r\n\r\nWater will sometimes drip through a crack in winter until that crack\r\nfreezes up, when the water may then find some other crack to drip\r\nthrough; at this second place a stalagmite may then grow, while at the\r\nfirst place the stalagmite may stop growing and even begin to diminish\r\nfrom evaporation.\r\n\r\nIce begins to form, whenever water gets into a cave, if the cave\r\ntemperature is below 0°; ice begins to melt as soon as the temperature\r\nis over 0°.\r\n\r\nProfessor Cranmer found that occasionally small quantities of ice form\r\nin caves in the summer months: this was in mountain caves, where there\r\nwas snow on the mountains and the temperature of the nights at least,\r\nhad sunk below freezing point: in fact when the conditions were those\r\nof the winter months.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART V.\r\n\r\nLIST OF AUTHORS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF AUTHORS.[75]\r\n\r\n[75] This list of authors includes all the authorities which I\r\nhave personally consulted.
