Nevertheless a word may not be out of\r\nplace for the inception of the work is out of the ordinary. Mr. Hard did\r\nnot decide that a book on this subject was needed and then set about\r\nstudying these interesting plants. He has observed them, collected them,\r\ninduced many friends to join in eating those which proved to be\r\npalatable and delicious--really meddled for years with the various kinds\r\nwhich are edible and otherwise, and then recently he has decided to\r\npublish a book on his favorite subject. The interesting occupation of\r\nphotographing the mushrooms and the toadstools doubtless has contributed\r\nlargely to the determination culminating in the materialization of the\r\ntreatise.\r\n\r\nIf I have correctly apprehended the origin and the contributing causes,\r\nwe would expect this book to be different from the other books on\r\nmushrooms--not of course in scope and purpose; but the instruction and\r\nsuggestions given, the descriptions and general remarks offered, the\r\nwide range of forms depicted in word and picture, the whole make up of\r\nthe book in fact, will appeal to the people at large rather than the\r\ncollege student in particular. The author does not write for the\r\nspecially educated few, but for the mass of intelligent people--those\r\nwho read and study, but who observe more; those who are inclined to\r\ncommune with nature as she displays herself in the glens and glades, in\r\nthe fields and forests, and who spend little, if any, time chasing the\r\nforms or sketching the tissues that may be seen on the narrow stage of a\r\ncompound microscope.\r\n\r\nThe book then is for the beginner, and for all beginners; the college\r\nstudent will find that this is the guide to use when he is ready to\r\nbegin studying the mushrooms; the teachers in the schools should all\r\nbegin to study mushrooms now, and for the purpose they will find this\r\nbook advantageous; the people who see mushrooms often but do not know\r\nthem may find here a book that really is a help.\r\n\r\nWe might wish for color photography when the subject is a delicately\r\ntinted mushroom; but if with it we should lose detail in structure then\r\nthe wish would be renounced. The colors can be, approximately,\r\ndescribed, often not so the characteristic markings, shapes and forms.\r\nThe halftones from the photographs will, we anticipate, prove a valuable\r\nfeature of the book, especially if the plants be most carefully examined\r\nbefore turning to the pictures. For half an hour the pages may be turned\r\nand the illustrations enjoyed. That, however, would give one no real\r\nknowledge of mushrooms. If such use only is made of the pictures, better\r\nhad they never been prepared by Mr. Hard and his friends. But if a\r\ncharming little toadstool, a delicately colored mushroom, a stately\r\nagaric, be carefully removed from the bed of loam, the decaying stump,\r\nor the old tree-trunk, then turned over and over again, and upside down,\r\nevery part scrutinized, the structure in every detail attentively\r\nregarded--not with repugnant feeling, rather with a sympathetic interest\r\nthat should naturally find all organisms inhabiting our globe--then in\r\ndue time coming to the picture, a real picture, in the book, it must\r\nsurely bring both pleasure and profit. Ponder the suggestion. Then, to\r\nconclude in a word, if Mr. Hard's book will induce people to _learn_ and\r\n_enjoy_ the mushrooms that we have, it will be a success, and great will\r\nbe his reward.\r\n\r\n  W. A. Kellerman, Ph. D.\r\n\r\n  _Botanical Department,\r\n  Ohio State University,\r\n  Columbus, O._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR'S NOTE\r\n\r\nIN MEMORIAM\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is with feelings of profound sadness that I am impelled to supplement\r\nthe above Introduction by a brief tribute to the memory of that genial\r\ngentleman and lovable companion, as well as enthusiastic scientist, the\r\nlate Dr. W. A. Kellerman.\r\n\r\nSpending his life in the pursuit of science, the Angel of Death overtook\r\nhim while still in search for wider knowledge of Nature and her works,\r\nand with icy fingers sealed the lids over eyes ever on the alert for the\r\ndiscovery of hidden truths.\r\n\r\nQuiet, reticent, and unassuming, it was given to but few to know the\r\ngreat-hearted, unselfish sweetness of nature underlying his whole life.\r\nYet the scientific world in general and Nature students especially,\r\nrecognize in Dr. Kellerman's death a loss long to be regretted and not\r\nsoon to be repaired.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing \"Introduction\" from his pen was one of the latest, if not\r\nthe last of his public writings, done but a few weeks before being\r\nstricken with the fatal fever which fell upon him in the forests of\r\nGuatemala, and so quickly ended his earthly hopes and aspirations.\r\n\r\nIt seems doubly sad that one so well and widely known in his life should\r\nbe called upon to lay its burdens and its pleasures down while so far\r\naway from all who knew and loved him well; and to rest at last among\r\nstrangers in a strange land.\r\n\r\nTo this beloved friend and companion of so many pleasant days in woods\r\nand fields the author of this book desires to pay the tribute of a\r\nloving remembrance and heartfelt appreciation.\r\n\r\n  The Author.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n    \"Various as beauteous, Nature, is thy face;\r\n    * * * all that grows, has grace.\r\n    All are appropriate. Bog and moss and fen\r\n    Are only poor to undiscerning men.\r\n    Here may the nice and curious eye explore\r\n    How Nature's hand adorns the ruby moor;\r\n    Beauties are these that from the view retire,\r\n    But will repay th' attention they require.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBotany and geology have been favorite studies of the author since\r\nleaving college, thanks to Dr. Nelson, who lives in the hearts of all\r\nhis students. He, by his teachings, made these subjects so attractive\r\nand interesting that by one, at least, every spare moment has been given\r\nto following up the studies of botany and paleontology. But the\r\nmycological part of botany was brought practically to the author's\r\nattention by the Bohemian children at Salem, Ohio, at the same time\r\narousing a desire to know the scientific side of the subject and thus to\r\nbe able to help the many who were seeking a personal knowledge of these\r\ninteresting plants.\r\n\r\nEvery teacher should be able to open the doors of Nature to his pupils\r\nthat they may see her varied handiwork, and, as far as possible, assist\r\nin removing the mist from their eyes that they may see clearly the\r\nbeauties of meadow, wood or hillside.\r\n\r\nIn beginning the fuller study of the subject the writer labored at great\r\ndisadvantage because, for a number of years, there was but little\r\navailable literature. Every book written upon this subject, in this\r\ncountry, was purchased as soon as it came out and all have been very\r\nhelpful.\r\n\r\nThe study has been a very great pleasure, and some very delightful\r\nfriendships have been made while in search for as great a variety of\r\nspecies as possible.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years the object was simply to become familiar with the\r\ndifferent genera and species, and no photographs of specimens were made.\r\nThis was a great mistake; for, after it was determined to bring out this\r\nwork, it seemed impossible to find many of the plants which the author\r\nhad previously found in other parts of the state.\r\n\r\nHowever, this failure has been very largely overcome through the\r\ngenerous courtesy of his esteemed friends,--Mr. C. G. Lloyd, of\r\nCincinnati; Dr. Fisher, of Detroit; Prof. Beardslee, of Ashville, N. C.;\r\nProf. B. O. Longyear, of Ft. Collins, Col., and Dr. Kellerman, of Ohio\r\nState University,--who have most kindly furnished photographs\r\nrepresenting those species found earlier in other parts of the state.\r\nThe species represented here have all been found in this state within\r\nthe past few years.\r\n\r\nThe writer is under great obligation to Prof. Atkinson, of Cornell\r\nUniversity, for his very great assistance and encouragement in the study\r\nof mycology. His patience in examining and determining plants sent him\r\nis more fully appreciated than can be expressed here. Dr. William\r\nHerbst, Trexlertown, Pa., has helped to solve many difficult problems;\r\nso also have Mr. Lloyd, Prof. Morgan, Capt. McIlvaine and Dr. Charles H.\r\nPeck, State Botanist of New York.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the book has been to describe the species, as far as\r\npossible, in terms that will be readily understood by the general\r\nreader; and it is hoped that the larger number of illustrations will\r\nmake the book helpful to those who are anxious to become acquainted with\r\na part of botany so little studied in our schools and colleges.\r\n\r\nNo pains have been spared to get as representative specimens as it was\r\npossible to find. A careful study of the illustrations of the plants\r\nwill, in most cases, very greatly assist the student in determining the\r\nclassification of the plant when found; but the illustration should not\r\nbe wholly relied upon, especially in the study of Boleti. The\r\ndescription should be carefully studied to see if it tallies with the\r\ncharacteristics of the plant in hand.\r\n\r\nIn many plants where notes had not been taken or had been lost, the\r\ndescriptions given by the parties naming the plants were used. This is\r\nnotably so of many of the Boleti. The author felt that Dr. Peck's\r\ndescriptions would be more accurate and complete, hence they were used,\r\ngiving him credit.\r\n\r\nCare has been taken to give the translation of names and to show why the\r\nplant was so called. It is always a wonder to the uninitiated how the\r\nLatin name is remembered, but when students see that the name includes\r\nsome prominent characteristic of the plant and thus discover its\r\napplicability, its recollection becomes comparatively easy.\r\n\r\nThe habitat and time of growth of each plant is given, also its\r\nedibility. The author was urged by his many friends throughout the\r\nstate, while in institute work and frequently talking upon this subject,\r\nto give them a book that would assist them in becoming familiar with the\r\ncommon mushrooms of their vicinity. The request has been complied with.\r\n\r\nIt is hoped that the work will be as helpful as it has been pleasant to\r\nperform.\r\n\r\n  M. E.

It was my practice to go out every day after flowers, especially\r\nthe rarer ones, of which there were many in this county, and bring in\r\nspecimens for the classes. There was in the city a wire nail mill,\r\nrunning day and night, whose proprietors brought over, from time to\r\ntime, large numbers of Bohemians as workers in the mill. Very\r\nfrequently, when driving to the country early in the morning, I found\r\nthe boys and girls of these Bohemian families searching the woods,\r\nfields and pastures at some distance from town, although they had not\r\nbeen in this country more than a week or two and could not speak a word\r\nof English. I soon found that they were gathering mushrooms of various\r\nkinds and taking them home for food material. They could not tell me how\r\nthey knew them, but I quickly learned that they knew them from their\r\ngeneral characteristics,--in fact, they knew them as we know people and\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nI resolved to know something of the subject myself. I had no literature\r\non mycology, and, at that time, there seemed to be little obtainable.\r\nAbout that time there appeared in Harper's Monthly an article by W.\r\nHamilton Gibson upon Edible Toadstools and Mushrooms--an article which I\r\nthoroughly devoured, soon after purchasing his book upon the subject.\r\n\r\nSalem, Ohio, was a very fertile locality for mushrooms and it was not\r\nlong till I was surprised at the number that I really knew. I remembered\r\nthat where there is a will there is a way.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 I moved to Bowling Green, Ohio; there I found many species which\r\nI had found about Salem, Ohio, but the extremely rich soil, heavy timber\r\nand numerous old lake beaches seemed to furnish a larger variety, so\r\nthat I added many more to my list. After remaining three years in\r\nBowling Green, making delightful acquaintance with the good people of\r\nthat city as well as with the flowers and mushrooms of Wood county,\r\nProvidence placed me in Sidney, Ohio, where I found many new species of\r\nfungi and renewed my acquaintance with many of those formerly met.\r\n\r\nSince coming to Chillicothe I have tried to have the plants photographed\r\nas I have found them, but having to depend upon a photographer I could\r\nnot always do this. I have not found in this vicinity many that I have\r\nfound elsewhere in the state, although I have found many new things\r\nhere, a fact which I attribute to the hilly nature of the county. For\r\nprints of many varieties of fungi obtained before coming here, I am\r\nindebted to my friends. I should advise any one intending to make a\r\nstudy of this subject to have all specimens photographed as soon as they\r\nare identified, thus fixing the species for future reference.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that every school teacher should know something of\r\nmycology. Some of my teachers have during the past year made quite a\r\nstudy of this interesting subject, and I have found that their pupils\r\nkept them busy in identifying their finds. Their lists of genera and\r\nspecies, as exhibited on the blackboards at the close of the season were\r\nquite long. I found from my Bohemian boys and girls that their teachers\r\nin their native country had opened for them the door to this very useful\r\nknowledge. Observation has proven to me conclusively that there is a\r\nlarge and increasing interest in this subject throughout the greater\r\npart of Ohio.\r\n\r\nEvery professional man needs a hobby which he may mount in his hours of\r\nrelaxation, and I am quite sure there is no field that offers better\r\ninducement for a canter than the subject of botany, and especially this\r\nparticular department of botanical work.\r\n\r\nI have a friend, a professional man who has an eye and a heart for all\r\nthe beauties of nature. After hours of confinement in his office at\r\nclose and critical work he is always anxious for a ramble over the\r\nhillsides and through the woods, and when we find anything new he seems\r\nto enjoy it beyond measure.\r\n\r\nMany ministers of the gospel have become famous in the mycological\r\nworld. The names of Rev. Lewis Schweiwitz, of Bethlehem, Pa.; Rev. M. J.\r\nBerkeley and Rev. John Stevenson, of England, will live as long as\r\nbotany is known to mankind. Their influence for good and helpfulness to\r\ntheir fellowmen will be everlasting.\r\n\r\nWith such an inspiration, how quickly one is lost to all business cares,\r\nand how free and life-giving are the fields, the meadows and the woods,\r\nso that one must exclaim with Prof. Henry Willey in his \"Introduction to\r\nthe Study of the Lichen\":\r\n\r\n    \"If I could put my woods in song,\r\n      And tell what's there enjoyed,\r\n    All men would to my garden throng,\r\n      And leave the cities void.\r\n    In my lot no tulips blow;\r\n      Snow-loving pines and oaks instead;\r\n    And rank the savage maples grow,\r\n      From Spring's first flush to Autumn red;\r\n    My garden is a forest ledge,\r\n      Which older forests bound.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOMS AND TOADSTOOLS\r\n\r\n=HOW TO TELL MUSHROOMS FROM TOADSTOOLS.= In all probability no student\r\nof mycology has any one query more frequently or persistently pressed\r\nupon his attention than the question, \"How do you tell a toadstool from\r\na mushroom?\"--or if in the woods or fields, in search for new species,\r\nwith an uninitiated comrade, he has frequently to decide whether a\r\ncertain specimen \"is a mushroom or a toadstool,\" so firmly fixed is the\r\nidea that one class of fungi--the toadstools--are poisonous, and the\r\nother--the mushrooms--are edible and altogether desirable; and these\r\ninquiring minds frequently seem really disappointed at being told that\r\nthey are one and the same thing; that there are edible toadstools and\r\nmushrooms, and poisonous mushrooms and toadstools; that in short a\r\ntoadstool is really a mushroom and a mushroom is only a toadstool after\r\nall.\r\n\r\nHence the questions with the beginner is, how he may tell a poisonous\r\nfungus from an edible one. There is but one answer to this question, and\r\nthat is that he must thoroughly learn both genera and species, studying\r\neach till he knows its special features as he does those of his most\r\nfamiliar friends.\r\n\r\nCertain species have been tested by a number of people and found to be\r\nperfectly safe and savory; on the other hand, there are species under\r\nvarious genera which, if not actually poisonous, are at least\r\ndeleterious.\r\n\r\nIt is the province of all books on fungi to assist the student in\r\nseparating the plants into genera and species; in this work special\r\nattention has been given to distinguishing between the edible and the\r\npoisonous species. There are a few species such as Gyromitra esculenta,\r\nLepiota Morgani, Clitocybe illudens, etc., which when eaten by certain\r\npersons will cause sickness soon after eating, while others will escape\r\nany disagreeable effects. Chemically speaking, they are not poisonous,\r\nbut simply refuse to be assimilated in some stomachs. It is best to\r\navoid all such.\r\n\r\n\r\n=HOW MUSHROOMS GROW.= There is a strong notion that mushrooms grow very\r\nquickly, springing up in a single night. This is erroneous. It is true\r\nthat after they have reached the button stage they develop very quickly;\r\nor in the case of those that spring from a mature egg, develop so\r\nrapidly that you can plainly see the motion of the upward growth, but\r\nthe development of the button from the mycelium or spawn takes\r\ntime--weeks, months, and even years. It would be very difficult to tell\r\nthe age of many of our tree fungi.\r\n\r\n\r\n=HOW TO LEARN MUSHROOMS.= If the beginner will avoid all Amanitas and\r\nperhaps some of the Boleti he need not be much worried in regard to the\r\nsafety of other species.\r\n\r\nThere are three ways by which he can become familiar with the edible\r\nkinds. The first is the physiological test suggested by Mr. Gibson in\r\nhis book. It consists in chewing a small morsel and then spitting it out\r\nwithout swallowing the juice; if no important symptoms arise within\r\ntwenty-four hours, another bit may be chewed, this time swallowing a\r\nsmall portion of the juice. Should no irritation be experienced after\r\nanother period of waiting, a still larger piece may be tried. I always\r\nsample a new plant carefully, and thus am often able to establish the\r\nfact of its edibility before being able to locate it in its proper\r\nspecies. This fall I found for the first time Tricholoma columbetta; it\r\nwas some time after I had proven it an edible mushroom before I had\r\nsettled upon its name. A better way, perhaps, is to cook them and feed\r\nthem to your cat and watch the result.\r\n\r\nAnother way is to have a friend who knows the plants go with you, and\r\nthus you learn under a teacher as a pupil learns in school. This is the\r\nquickest way to gain a knowledge of plants of any kind, but it is\r\ndifficult to find a competent teacher.\r\n\r\nStill another way, and one that is open to all, is to gain a knowledge\r\nof a few species and through their description become familiar with the\r\nterms used in describing a mushroom; this done, the way is open, if you\r\nhave a book containing illustrations and descriptions of the most common\r\nplants. Do not be in a hurry to get the names of all the plants, and do\r\nnot make use of any about which you are not absolutely sure. In\r\ngathering mushrooms to eat, do not put into your basket with those you\r\nintend to eat a single mushroom of whose edible qualities you have any\r\ndoubt. If you have the least doubt about it, discard it, or put it in\r\nanother basket.\r\n\r\nThere are no fixed rules by which you can tell a poisonous from an\r\nedible mushroom. I found a friend of mine eating Lepiota naucina, not\r\neven knowing to what genus it belonged, simply because she could peel\r\nit. I told her that the most deadly mushroom can be peeled just as\r\nreadily. Nor is there anything more valuable in the silver spoon test in\r\nwhich Mr. Gibson's old lady put so much confidence. Some say, do not eat\r\nany that have an acrid taste; many are edible whose taste is quite\r\nacrid. Others say, do not eat any whose juice or milk is white, but this\r\nwould discard a number of Lactarii that are quite good. There is nothing\r\nin the white gills and hollow stem theory. It is true that the Amanita\r\nhas both, but it must be known by other characteristics. Again we are\r\ntold to avoid such as have a viscid cap, or those that change color\r\nquickly; this is too sweeping a condemnation for it would cut out\r\nseveral very good species. I think I may safely say there is no known\r\nrule by which the good can be distinguished from the bad. The only safe\r\nway is to know each species by its own individual peculiarities--to know\r\nthem as we know our friends.\r\n\r\nThe student of mycology has before him a description of each species,\r\nwhich must tally with the plant in hand and which will soon render him\r\nfamiliar with the different features of the various genera and species,\r\nso he can recognize them as readily as the features of his best friends.\r\n\r\n\r\n=WHAT ANYONE MAY EAT.= In the spring of the year there comes with the\r\nearliest flowers a mushroom so strongly characteristic in all its forms\r\nthat no one will fail to recognize it. It is the common morel or sponge\r\nmushroom. None of them are known to be harmful, hence here the beginner\r\ncan safely trust his judgment. While he is gathering morels to eat he\r\nwill soon begin to distinguish the different species of the genera. From\r\nMay till frost the different kinds of puff-balls will appear. All\r\npuff-balls are good while their interior remains white. They are never\r\npoisonous, but when the flesh has begun to turn yellow it is very\r\nbitter. The oyster mushroom is found from March to December and is\r\nalways a very acceptable mushroom. The Fairy Rings are easily recognized\r\nand can be found in any old pasture during wet weather from June to\r\nOctober. In seasonable weather they are usually very plentiful. The\r\ncommon meadow mushroom is found from September to frost. It is known by\r\nits pink gills and meaty cap. There is a mushroom with pink gills found\r\nin streets, along the pavements and among the cobble stones. The stems\r\nare short and the caps are very meaty. It is A. rodmani. These are found\r\nin May and June. The horse mushroom has pink gills and may be found\r\nfrom June to September. The Russulas, found from July to October, are\r\ngenerally good. A few should be avoided because of their acrid taste or\r\ntheir strong odor. There is no time from early spring till freezing\r\nweather when you can not find mushrooms, if the weather is at all\r\nfavorable. I have given the habitat and the time when each species can\r\nbe found. I should recommend a careful study of these two points. Read\r\nthe descriptions of plants which grow in certain places and at certain\r\ntimes, and you will generally be rewarded, if you follow out the\r\ndescription and the season is favorable.\r\n\r\n\r\n=HOW TO PRESERVE MUSHROOMS.= Many can be dried for winter use, such as\r\nthe Morels, Marasmius oreades, Boletus edulis, Boletus edulis, va.\r\nclavipes, and a number of others. My wife has very successfully canned a\r\nnumber of species, notably Lycoperdon pyriforme, Pleurotus ostreatus and\r\nTricholoma personatum. The mushrooms were carefully picked over and\r\nwashed, let stand in salt water for about five minutes, in order to free\r\nthem of any insect-life which may be in the gills, then drained, cut\r\ninto pieces small enough to go into the jars easily. Each jar was packed\r\nas full as possible with mushrooms and filled up with water salt enough\r\nto flavor the mushroom properly. Then put into a kettle of cold water on\r\nthe stove, the lids being loosely placed on the top, and allowed to cook\r\nfor an hour or more after the water in the kettle begins to boil. The\r\ntops were then fastened on securely and after trying the jars to see if\r\nthere was any leak, they were set away in a cool, dark place.\r\n\r\nIn canning puff-balls they should be carefully washed and sliced, being\r\nsure that they are perfectly white all through. They do not need to\r\nstand in salt water before packing in the jar as do those mushrooms\r\nwhich have gills. Otherwise they were canned as the Tricholoma and\r\noyster mushroom. Any edible mushroom can easily be kept for winter use\r\nby canning. Use glass jars with glass tops.\r\n\r\n\r\nTERMS USED\r\n\r\n=SOME OF THE MOST COMMON TERMS USED.= In describing mushrooms it is\r\nnecessary to use certain terms, and it will be incumbent upon anyone who\r\nwishes to become familiar with this part of botanical work to understand\r\nthoroughly the terms used in describing the plants.\r\n\r\nThe substance of all mushrooms is either fleshy, membranaceous, or\r\ncorky. The _pileus_ or _cap_ is the expanded part, which may be either\r\nsessile or supported by a stem. The pileus is not made up of cellular\r\ntissue as in flowering plants, but of myriads of interwoven threads or\r\nhyphae. This structure of the pileus will become evident at once if a\r\nthin portion of the cap is placed under the microscope.\r\n\r\nThe _gills_ or _lamellæ_ are thin plates or membranes radiating from the\r\nstem to the margin of the cap. When they are attached squarely and\r\nfirmly to the stem they are said to be _adnate_. If they are attached\r\nonly by a part of the width of the gills, they are _adnexed_. Should\r\nthey extend down on the stem, they are _decurrent_. They are _free_ when\r\nthey are not attached to the stem. Frequently the lower edge is notched\r\nat, or near, the stem and in this case they are said to be _emarginate_\r\nor _sinuate_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--Small portion of a section through the\r\nspore-bearing layer of a mushroom which produces its spores on the ends\r\nof cells called basidium. (a) Spores, (b) basidium, (c) sterile cells.]\r\n\r\nIn some genera the lower surface of the cap is full of pores instead of\r\ngills; in other genera the lower surface is crowded with teeth; in still\r\nothers the surface is smooth, as in the Stereums. The gills, pores and\r\nteeth afford a foundation for the hymenium or fruit-bearing surface. It\r\nwill be readily seen that the gills, pores and teeth simply expose in a\r\nvery economical way the greatest possible spore-bearing surface.\r\n\r\nIf a section of the gills be examined by a microscope, it will be\r\nobserved that upon both sides of the surface are extended hymenial\r\nlayers. The _hymenium_ consists of elongated cells or basidia\r\n(singular, basidium) more or less club-shaped. Figure 2 will show how\r\nthese basidia appear on the hymenial layer when strongly magnified. It\r\nwill be seen that they are placed side by side and are perpendicular to\r\nthe surface of the gills. Upon each of these basidia are in some species\r\ntwo, usually four, slender projections upon which the spores are\r\nproduced. In Figure 2 a number of sterile cells will be seen which\r\nresemble the basidia except that the latter bear four sterigmata upon\r\nwhich the spores rest. Among these basidia and sterile cells will\r\nfrequently be seen an overgrown bladder-like sterile basidium which\r\nprojects beyond the rest of the hymenium, and whose use is not as yet\r\nfully known. They are called cystidia (singular, cystidium). They are\r\nnever numerous, but they are scattered over the entire surface, becoming\r\nmore numerous along the edge of the gills. When they are colored, they\r\nchange the appearance of the gills.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--Rootlike strands of mycelium of the\r\npear-shaped puff-ball growing in rotten wood. Young puff-balls in the\r\nform of small white knots are forming on the strands. Natural\r\nsize.--_Longyear._]\r\n\r\nThe spores are the seeds of the mushroom. They are of various sizes and\r\nshapes, with a variety of surface markings. They are very small, as fine\r\nas dust, and invisible to the naked eye, except as they are seen in\r\nmasses on the grass, on the ground, or on logs, or in a spore print. It\r\nis the object of every fungus to produce spores. Some fall on the parent\r\nhost or upon the ground. Others are wafted away by every rise of the\r\nwind and carried for days and finally settle down, it may be, in other\r\nstates and continents from those in which they started. Millions perish\r\nbecause of not finding a suitable resting place. Those spores that do\r\nfind a favorable resting-place, under right conditions, will begin to\r\ngerminate by sending out a slender thread-like filament, or hyphæ, which\r\nat once branches out in search of food material, and which always forms\r\na more or less felted mass, called mycelium. When first formed the hyphæ\r\nare continuous and ramify through the nourishing substratum from which\r\nthere arises afterward a spore-bearing growth known as the sporocarp or\r\nyoung mushroom. This vegetative part of the fungus is usually hidden in\r\nthe soil, or in decayed wood, or vegetable matter. In Figure 3 is a\r\nrepresentation of the mycelium of the small pear-shaped puff-ball with a\r\nnumber of small white knobs marking the beginning of the puff-ball. The\r\nmycelium exposed here is very similar to the mycelium of all mushrooms.\r\n\r\nIn the pore-bearing genera the hymenium lines the vertical pores; in\r\nteeth-bearing fungi it lines the surface of each tooth, or is spread out\r\nover the smooth surface of the Stereum.\r\n\r\nThe development of the spores is quite interesting. The young basidia as\r\nseen in Figure 2 are filled with a granular protoplasm. Soon small\r\nprojections, called sterigma (plural, sterigmata), make their appearance\r\non the ends of the basidia and the protoplasm passes into them. Each\r\nprojection or sterigma soon swells at its extremity into a bladder-like\r\nbody, the young spore, and, as they enlarge, the protoplasm of the\r\nbasidium is passed into them. When the four spores are full grown they\r\nhave consumed all the protoplasm in the basidium. The spores soon\r\nseparate by a transverse partition and fall off. All spores of the\r\nHymenomycetous fungi are arranged and produced in a similar manner, with\r\ntheir spore-bearing surface exposed early in life by the rupture of the\r\nuniversal veil.\r\n\r\nIn the puff-balls the spores are arranged in the same way, but the\r\nhymenium is inclosed within an outer sack. When the spores are ripe the\r\ncase is ruptured and the spores escape into the air as a dusty powder.\r\nThe puff-balls, therefore, belong to the Gastromycetous fungi because\r\nits spores are inclosed in a pouch until they are matured.\r\n\r\nAnother very large group of fungi is the Ascomycetes, or sac fungi. It\r\nis very easily determined because all of its members develop their\r\nspores inside of small membranous sacs or asci. These asci are generally\r\nintermixed with slender, empty asci, or sterile cells, called\r\nparaphyses. These asci are variously shaped bodies and are known in\r\ndifferent orders by different names, such as ascoma, apothecium,\r\nperithecium, and receptacle. The Ascomycetes often include among their\r\nnumbers fungi ranging in size from microscopic one-celled plants to\r\nquite large and very beautiful specimens. To this group belong the great\r\nnumber of small fungi producing the various plant diseases.\r\n\r\nIn a work of this kind especial attention is naturally given to the\r\norder of Discomycetes or cup fungi. This order is very large and is so\r\ncalled because so many of the plants are cup shaped. These cups vary\r\ngreatly in size and form; some are so small that it requires a lens to\r\nexamine them; some are saucer-shaped; some are like goblets, and some\r\nresemble beakers of various shapes. The saddle fungi and morels belong\r\nto this order. Here the sac surface is often convoluted, lobed, and\r\nridged, in order to afford a greater sac-bearing surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--Small portion of a section through the\r\nspore-bearing part of a morel in which the spores are produced in little\r\nsacs or asci. (a) An ascus, (b) an ascus discharging its spores, (c) the\r\nspores, (d) sterile cells. Highly magnified.--_Longyear._]\r\n\r\nIn the mushrooms, puff-balls, etc., we find the spores were borne on the\r\nends of basidia, usually four spores on each. In this group the spores\r\nare formed in minute club-shaped sacs, known as asci (singular, ascus).\r\nThese asci are long, cylindrical sacs, standing side by side,\r\nperpendicular to the fruiting surface. Figure 4 will illustrate their\r\nposition together with the sterile cells on the fruiting surface of one\r\nof the morels. They usually have eight spores in each sac or ascus.\r\n\r\nThe stem of the mushroom is usually in the center of the cap, yet it may\r\nbe eccentric or lateral; when it is wanting, the pileus is said to be\r\nsessile. The stem is solid when it is fleshy throughout, or hollow when\r\nit has a central cavity, or stuffed when the interior is filled with\r\npithy substance. The stems are either fleshy or cartilaginous. When the\r\nformer, it is of the same consistency as the pileus. If the latter, its\r\nconsistency is always different from the pileus, resembling cartilage.\r\nThe stem of the Tricholoma affords a good example of the fleshy stemmed\r\nmushroom, and that of the Marasmius illustrates the cartilaginous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--Small portion of a stem of a morel showing\r\ncell filaments. Highly magnified.--_Longyear._]\r\n\r\nIf the cap or stem of a mushroom is examined with a microscope of high\r\nmagnifying power it will be found to be made up of a continuation of the\r\nmycelial filaments, interlaced and interwoven, branching, and the\r\ntubular filaments often delicately divided, giving the appearance of\r\ncells. Figure 5 represents a small portion of a Morel stem highly\r\nmagnified showing the cell filaments. In soft fungi the mycelial threads\r\nare more loosely woven and have thin walls with fewer partitions.\r\n\r\nThe _veil_ is a thin sheet of mycelial threads covering the gills,\r\nsometimes remaining on the stem, forming a _ring_ or _annulus_. This\r\nsometimes remains for a time on the margin of the cap when it is said to\r\nbe _appendiculate_. Sometimes it resembles a spider's web when it is\r\ncalled _arachnoid_.\r\n\r\nThe _volva_ is a universal wrapper, surrounding the entire plant when\r\nyoung, but which is soon ruptured, leaving a trace in the form of scales\r\non the cap and a sheath around the base of the stem, or breaking up into\r\nscales or a scaly ring at the base of the stem. All plants having this\r\nuniversal volva should be avoided, further than for the purpose of\r\nstudy. Care should be taken that, in their young state, they are not\r\nmistaken for puff-balls. Frequently when found in the egg state they\r\nresemble a small puff-ball. Figure 6 represents a section of an Amanita\r\nin the egg-state and also the Gemmed puff-ball. As soon as a section is\r\nmade and carefully examined the structure of the inside will reveal the\r\nplant at once. There is but little danger of confusing the egg stage of\r\nan Amanita with the puff-ball, for they resemble each other only in\r\ntheir oval shape, and not in the least in their marking on the surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--The lefthand figure represents a vertical\r\nsection through a young plant of the gemmed puff-ball showing the\r\ncellular structure of the stem-like lower half, called the subgleba. The\r\nrighthand figure shows a vertical section of the egg stage of an\r\nAmanita, a very poisonous fungus which grows in woods and which might be\r\nmistaken for a young puff-ball if not cut open. The fungus forms just\r\nbelow the surface of the soil, finally bursting the volva, sending up a\r\nparasol mushroom. Natural size.--_Longyear._]\r\n\r\n\r\n=WHAT IS A FUNGUS OR A MUSHROOM?= It is a cellular, flowerless plant,\r\nnourished by the mycelium which permeates the soil or other substances\r\non which the fungus or mushroom grows. All fungi are either parasites or\r\nsaprophytes which have lost their chlorophyll, and are incapable of\r\nsupporting an independent existence.\r\n\r\nThere is a vast number of genera and species, and many have the\r\nparasitic habit which causes them to enter the bodies of other plants\r\nand of animals. For this reason all fungi are of economic importance,\r\nespecially the microscopic forms classed under the head of Bacteria.\r\nSome recent writers are inclined to separate the Bacteria and\r\nslime-molds from the fungus group, and call them fungus animals.\r\nHowever this may be, they are true plants and have many of the\r\ncharacteristics of the fungi. They may differ from the fungi in their\r\nvegetative functions, yet they have so many things in common that I am\r\ninclined to place them under this group.\r\n\r\nMany, such as the yeast fungus, the various fermentative fungi, and the\r\nBacteria concerned in the process of decomposition, are indeed very\r\nuseful. The enrichment and preparation of soils for the uses of higher\r\nplants, effected by Bacteria, are very important services.\r\n\r\nParasites derive their nourishment from living plants and animals. They\r\nare so constituted that when their nourishing threads come within range\r\nof the living plant they answer a certain impulse by sending out special\r\nthreads, enveloping the host and absorbing nutrition. Saprophitic plants\r\ndo not experience this reaction from the living plants. They are\r\ncompelled to get their nourishment from decaying products of plants or\r\nanimals, consequently they live in rich ground or leaf mold, on decayed\r\nwood, or on dung. Parasites are usually small, being limited by their\r\nhost. Saprophytes are not thus limited for food supply and it is\r\npossible to build up large plants such as the common mushroom group,\r\npuff-balls, etc.\r\n\r\nThe spores are the seeds or reproductive bodies of the mushroom. They\r\nare very fine, and invisible to the naked eye except when collected\r\ntogether in great masses. Underneath mushrooms, frequently, the grass or\r\nwood will be white or plainly discolored from the spores. The hymenium\r\nis the surface or part of the plant which bears the spores. The\r\nhymenophore is the part which supports the hymenium.\r\n\r\nIn the common mushroom, and in fact many others, the spores develop on a\r\ncertain club-like cell, called basidium (plural, basidia), on each of\r\nwhich four spores usually develop. In morels these cells are elongated\r\ninto cylindrical membranous sacs called asci, in each of which eight\r\nspores are usually developed. The spores will be found of various\r\ncolors, shapes, and sizes, a fact which will be of great assistance to\r\nthe student in locating strange species and genera. In germination the\r\nspores send out slender threads which Botanists call mycelium, but which\r\ncommon readers know as spawn.\r\n\r\nThe method and place of spore development furnish a basis for the\r\nclassification of fungi. The best way to acquire a thorough knowledge of\r\nboth our edible and poisonous mushrooms is to study them in the light of\r\nthe primary characters employed in their classification and their\r\nnatural relation to each other.\r\n\r\nThere is a wide difference of opinion as to the classification of\r\nmushrooms. Perhaps the most simple and satisfactory is that of Underwood\r\nand Cook. They arrange them under six groups:\r\n\r\n  1. Basidiomycetes--those in which the spores or reproductive bodies\r\n        are naked or external as shown in illustration 2 on page 15.\r\n\r\n  2. Ascomycetes--those in which the spores are inclosed in sacs or\r\n        asci. These sacs are very clearly represented in illustration\r\n        Figure 4 on page 18. This will include the Morels, Pezizæ,\r\n        Pyrenomycetes, Tuberaceæ, Sphairiacei, etc.\r\n\r\n  3. Physcomycetes--including the Mucorini, Saprolegniaceæ, and\r\n        Peronosporeæ. Potato rot and downy mildew on grape vines belong\r\n        to this family.\r\n\r\n  4. Myxomycetes--Slime moulds.\r\n\r\n  5. Saccharomycetes--Yeast fungi.\r\n\r\n  6. Schizomycetes--are minute, unicellular Protophytes which reproduce\r\n        mainly by transverse fission.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS, FUNGI--SUB-CLASS, BASIDIOMYCETES.\r\n\r\nThis class will include all gill-bearing fungi, Polyporus, Boletus,\r\nHydnum, etc.\r\n\r\nFungi of this class are divided into four natural groups:\r\n\r\n  1. Hymenomycetes.\r\n  2. Gasteromycetes.\r\n  3. Uredinæ.\r\n  4. Ustilagineæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUP 1--HYMENOMYCETES.\r\n\r\nUnder this group will be placed all fungi composed of membranes, fleshy,\r\nwoody, or gelatinous, whether growing on the ground or on wood. The\r\nhymenium, or spore-bearing surface, is external at an early stage in the\r\nlife of the plant. The spores are borne on basidia as explained in\r\nFigure 2, page 6. When the spores ripen they fall to the ground or are\r\ncarried by the wind to a host that presents all the conditions necessary\r\nfor germination; there they produce the mycelia or white thread-like\r\nvines that one may have noticed in plowing sod, in old chip piles, or\r\ndecayed wood. If one will examine these threads there will be found\r\nsmall knots which will in time develop into the full grown mushroom.\r\nHymenomycetes are divided into six families:\r\n\r\n  1. Agaricaceæ. Hymenium with gills.\r\n  2. Polyporaceæ. Hymenium with pores.\r\n  3. Hydnaceæ. Hymenium with spines.\r\n  4. Thelephoraceæ. Hymenium horizontal and mostly on the under surface.\r\n  5. Clavariaceæ. Hymenium on a smooth club-shaped surface.\r\n  6. Tremellaceæ. Hymenium even and superior. Gelatinous fungi.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY 1--AGARICACEAE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 7.--Spore-print of Agaricus arvensis.]\r\n\r\nIn the Agaricaceæ or common mushrooms, and in all other of similar\r\nstructure, the spore-producing membranes are found on the under surface\r\nof the cap. They consist of thin lamellæ, or gills, attached by the\r\nupper edge to the cap and extending from the stem to the margin of the\r\ncap. Very frequently that space may be entirely utilized by shorter\r\nlamellæ, or gills, intervening between the longer, especially toward the\r\nmargin of the cap. In a few species where the stem seems to be wanting,\r\nor where it is attached to the side of the cap, the lamellæ, or gills,\r\nradiate from the point of attachment or from the lateral stem to other\r\nparts of the circumference of the cap. Berkeley gives the following\r\ncharacteristics: Hymenium, inferior, spread over easily divisible gills\r\nor plates, radiating from a center or stem, which may be either simple\r\nor branched.\r\n\r\nThis family includes the following genera:\r\n\r\n  1. Agaricus--Gills, not melting, edge acute; including all the\r\n        sub-genera which have been elevated to the rank of genera.\r\n\r\n  2. Coprinus--Gills deliquescent, spores black.\r\n\r\n  3. Cortinarius--Gills persistent, veil spider-web-like, terrestrial.\r\n\r\n  4. Paxillus--Gills separating from the hymenophorum and decurrent.\r\n\r\n  5. Gomphidius--Gills branched and decurrent, pileus top-shaped.\r\n\r\n  6. Bolbitius--Gills becoming moist, spores colored.\r\n\r\n  7. Lactarius--Gills milky, terrestrial.\r\n\r\n  8. Russula--Gills equal, rigid, and brittle, terrestrial.\r\n\r\n  9. Marasmius--Gills thick, tough, hymenium dry.\r\n\r\n  10. Hygrophorus--Stem confluent with the hymenophorum; gills sharp\r\n        edged.\r\n\r\n  11. Cantharellus--Gills thick, branched, rounded edge.\r\n\r\n  12. Lentinus--Pileus hairy, hard, tough; gills, tough, unequal,\r\n        toothed; on logs and stumps.\r\n\r\n  13. Lenzites--Whole plant corky; gills simple or branched.\r\n\r\n  14. Trogia--Gills venose, fold-like, channelled.\r\n\r\n  15. Panus--Gills corky, with acute edge.\r\n\r\n  16. Nyctalis--Veil universal; gills broad, often parasitic.\r\n\r\n  17. Schizophyllum--Gills corky, split longitudinally.\r\n\r\n  18. Xerotus--Gills tough, fold-like.\r\n\r\nTherefore the gill-bearing fungi are known under the family name,\r\nAgaricaceæ, or more generally known as Agarics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 8.--Spore-print of Hypholoma sublatertium.]\r\n\r\nThis family is divided into five series, according to the color of their\r\nspores. The spores when seen in masses possess certain colors, white,\r\nrosy, rusty, purple-brown and black. Therefore the first and most\r\nimportant part to be determined in locating a mushroom is to ascertain\r\nthe color of the spores. To do this, take a fresh, perfect, and fully\r\ndeveloped specimen, remove the stem from the cap. Place the cap with the\r\ngills downward on the surface of dark velvety paper, if you suspect the\r\nspores to be white. Invert a finger bowl or a bell glass over the cap to\r\nkeep the air from blowing the spores away. If the spores should be\r\ncolored, white paper should be used. If the specimen is left too long\r\nthe spore deposit will continue upward between the gills and it may\r\nreach an eighth of an inch in height, in which case if great care is\r\ntaken in removing the cap there will be a perfect likeness of the gills\r\nand also the color of the spores.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 9.--Spore-print of a Flammula.]\r\n\r\nThere are two ways of making these spore prints quite permanent. First\r\ntake a piece of thin rice paper, muscilage it and allow it to dry, then\r\nproceed as above. In this way the print will stand handling quite a\r\nlittle. Another way, and that used to prepare the spore-prints in these\r\nphotographs, is to obtain the spore-print upon Japanese paper as in the\r\npreceding method, then by an atomizer spray the print gently and\r\ncarefully with a fixative such as is used in fixing charcoal drawings.\r\nSuccess in making spore-prints requires both time and care, but the\r\nsatisfaction they give is ample recompense for the trouble. It is more\r\ndifficult to obtain good prints from the white-spored mushrooms than\r\nfrom those bearing colored spores, because it is hard to obtain a black\r\npaper having a dull velvety surface, and the spores will not adhere well\r\nto a smooth-finished, glossy paper. For the prints illustrated I am\r\nindebted to Mrs. Blackford.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 10.--Spore-print of a Boletus.]\r\n\r\nIf the plant is dry it is well to moisten the fingerbowl or bell-glass\r\non the inside before placing it over the mushroom. The spores of Boleti,\r\nand, indeed, all fungi can be caught and fixed in the same way.\r\n\r\nFrom the study of these spore-prints we shall find five different colors\r\nof spores. This family is, therefore, divided into five series,\r\ndetermined by the color of the spores, which are always constant in\r\ncolor, size and shape.\r\n\r\nThe five series will be treated in the following order:\r\n\r\n  1. The white-spored Agarics.\r\n  2. The rosy-spored Agarics.\r\n  3. The rusty-spored Agarics.\r\n  4. The purple-brown-spored Agarics.\r\n  5. The black-spored Agarics.\r\n\r\n\r\n=ANALYTICAL KEY.=\r\n\r\nThis key is largely based upon Cooke's analytical key. Its use will help\r\nto locate the plant in hand in the genus to which it belongs.\r\n\r\nThe first thing the student should do is to determine the color of the\r\nspore if it is not evident. This is best done according to the plan\r\ndescribed on page 15.\r\n\r\nThe plant should be fresh and mature. Careful attention should be given\r\nto different stages of development. The habit of the plant should be\r\nconsidered; then, as soon as the color of the spores is determined, it\r\nwill be an easy matter to locate the genus by means of the key.\r\n\r\n\r\nGROUP I--HYMENOMYCETES.\r\n\r\nMycelium floccose, giving rise to a distinct hymenium, fungus fleshy,\r\nmembranaceous, woody or gelatinous.

Most of the former are firmer, while the\r\nblack spored specimens soon deliquesce. The white spores are usually\r\noval, sometimes round, and in many cases quite spiny. All white-spored\r\nspecimens will be found in clean places.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amanita. Pers._\r\n\r\n_Amanita_ is supposed to be derived from Mount Amanus, an ancient name\r\nof a range separating Cilicia from Syria. It is supposed that Galen\r\nfirst brought specimens of this fungus from that region.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Amanita_ has both a volva and veil. The spores are white and\r\nthe stem is readily separable from the cap. The volva is universal at\r\nfirst, enveloping the young plant, yet distinct and free from the\r\ncuticle of the pileus.\r\n\r\nThis genus contains some of the most deadly poisonous mushrooms,\r\nalthough a few are known to be very good. There is a large number of\r\nspecies--about 75 being known, 42 of which have been found in this\r\ncountry--a few being quite common in this state. All the Amanita are\r\nterrestrial plants, mostly solitary in their habits, and chiefly found\r\nin the woods, or in well wooded grounds.\r\n\r\nIn the button stage it resembles a small egg or puff-ball, as will be\r\nseen in Figure 6, page 11, and great care should be taken to distinguish\r\nit from the latter, if one is hunting puff-balls to eat; yet the danger\r\nis not great, since the volva usually breaks before the plant comes\r\nthrough the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amanita phalloides. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE DEADLY AMANITA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 11.--Amanita phalloides. Fr. Showing volva at the\r\nbase, cap dark.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 12.--Amanita phalloides. Fr. White form showing\r\nvolva, scaly stem, ring.]\r\n\r\n_Phalloides_ means phallus-like. This plant and its related species are\r\ndeadly poisonous. For this reason the plant should be carefully studied\r\nand thoroughly known by every mushroom hunter. In different localities,\r\nand sometimes in the same locality, the plant will appear in very\r\ndifferent shades of color. There are also variations in the way in which\r\nthe volva is ruptured, as well as in the character of the stem.\r\n\r\nThe beginner will imagine he has a new species often, till he becomes\r\nthoroughly acquainted with all the idiosyncrasies of this plant.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is smooth, even, viscid when young and moist, frequently\r\nadorned with a few fragments of the volva, white, grayish white,\r\nsometimes smoky-brown; whether the pileus be white, oyster-color or\r\nsmoky-brown, the center of the cap will be several shades darker than\r\nthe margin. The plant changes from a knob or egg-shape when young, to\r\nalmost flat when fully expanded. Many plants have a marked umbo on the\r\ntop of the cap and the rim of the cap may be slightly turned up.\r\n\r\nThe gills are always white, wide, ventricose, rounded next to the stem,\r\nand free from it.\r\n\r\nThe stem is smooth, white unless in cases where the cap is dark, then\r\nthe stem of those plants are apt to be of the same color, tapering\r\nupward as in the specimen (Fig. 11); stuffed, then hollow, inclined to\r\ndiscolor when handled.\r\n\r\nThe volva of this species is quite variable and more or less buried in\r\nthe ground, where careful observation will reveal it.\r\n\r\nOne need never confound this species with the meadow mushroom, for the\r\nspores of that are always purple-brown, while a spore-print of this will\r\nalways reveal white spores. I have seen a slight tint of pink in the\r\ngills of the A. phalloides but the spores were always white. Until one\r\nknows thoroughly both Lepiota naucina and A. phalloides before eating\r\nthe former he should always hunt carefully for the remains of a volva\r\nand a bulbous base in the soil.\r\n\r\nThis plant is quite conspicuous and inviting in all of its various\r\nshades of color. It is found in woods, and along the margin of woods,\r\nand sometimes on lawns. It is from four to eight inches high and the\r\npileus from three to five inches broad. There is a personality about the\r\nplant that renders it readily recognizable after it has once been\r\nlearned. Found from August to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amanita recutita. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE FRESH-SKINNED AMANITA. POISONOUS.\r\n\r\nRecutita, having a fresh or new skin. Pileus convex, then expanded, dry,\r\nsmooth, often covered with small scales, fragments of the volva; margin\r\nalmost even, gray or brownish.\r\n\r\nThe gills forming lines down the stem.\r\n\r\nThe stem stuffed, then hollow, attenuated upward, silky, white, ring\r\ndistant, edge of volva not free, frequently obliterated.\r\n\r\nRather common where there is much pine woods. August to October.\r\n\r\nThis species differs from A. porphyria in ring not being brown or\r\nbrownish.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amanita virosa. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE POISONOUS AMANITA.\r\n\r\nVirosa, full of poison. The pileus is from four to five inches broad;\r\nthe entire plant white, conical, then expanded; viscid when moist;\r\nmargin often somewhat lobed, even.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free, crowded.\r\n\r\nThe stem is frequently six inches long, stuffed, round, with a bulbous\r\nbase, attenuated upward, squamulose, ring near apex, volva large, lax.\r\n\r\nThe spores are subglobose, 8-10µ. This is probably simply a form of A.\r\nphalloides. It is found in damp woods. August to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amanita muscaria. Linn._\r\n\r\nTHE FLY AMANITA. POISONOUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 13.--Amanita muscaria.--_Linn._ Cap reddish or\r\norange, showing scales on the cap and at base of stem.]\r\n\r\nMuscaria, from musca, a fly. The fly Amanita is a very conspicuous and\r\nhandsome plant. It is so called because infusions of it are used to kill\r\nflies. I have frequently seen dead flies on the fully developed caps,\r\nwhere they had sipped of the dew upon the cap, and, like the\r\nLotos-eaters of old, had forgotten to move away. It is a very abundant\r\nplant in the woods of Columbiana county, this state. It is also found\r\nfrequently in many localities about Chillicothe. It is often a very\r\nhandsome and attractive plant, because of the bright colors of the cap\r\nin contrast with the white stem and gills, as well as the white scales\r\non the surface of the cap. These scales seem to behave somewhat\r\ndifferently from those of other species of Amanita. Instead of\r\nshrivelling, curling, and falling off they are inclined to adhere firmly\r\nto the smooth skin of the pileus, turning brownish, and in the maturely\r\nexpanded plant appear like scattered drops of mud which have dried upon\r\nthe pileus, as you will observe in Figure 13.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is three to five inches broad, globose at first, then\r\ndumb-bell in shape, convex, then expanded, nearly flat in age; margin in\r\nmatured plants slightly striate; the surface of the cap is covered with\r\nwhite floccose scales, fragments of the volva, these scales being easily\r\nremoved so that old plants are frequently comparatively smooth. The\r\ncolor of the young plant is normally red, then orange to pale yellow;\r\nlate in the season, or in old plants, it fades to almost white. The\r\nflesh is white, sometimes stained yellow close to the cuticle.\r\n\r\nThe gills are pure white, very symmetrical, various in length, the\r\nshorter ones terminating under the cap very abruptly, crowded, free, but\r\nreaching the stem, decurrent in the form of lines somewhat broader in\r\nfront, sometimes a slight tinge of yellow will be observed in the gills.\r\n\r\nThe stem is white, often yellowish with age, pithy and often hollow,\r\nbecoming rough and shaggy, finally scaly, the scales below appearing to\r\nmerge into the form of an obscure cup, the stem four to six inches long.\r\n\r\nThe veil covers the gills of the young plant and later is seen as a\r\ncollar-like ring on the stem, soft, lax, deflexed, in old specimens it\r\nis often destroyed. The spores are white and broadly elliptical.\r\n\r\nThe history of this plant is as interesting as a novel. Its deadly\r\nproperties were known to the Greeks and Romans. The pages of history\r\nrecord its undoing and its accessory to crime. Pliny says, alluding to\r\nthis species, \"very conveniently adapted for poisoning.\" This was\r\nundoubtedly the species that Agrippina, the mother of Nero, used to\r\npoison her husband, the Emperor Claudius; and the same that Nero used in\r\nthat famous banquet when all his guests, his tribunes and centurions,\r\nand Agrippina herself, fell victims to its poisonous properties.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is said this mushroom is habitually eaten by certain people\r\nas an intoxicant; indeed, it is used in Kamchatka and Asiatic Russia,\r\ngenerally, where the Amanita drunkard takes the place of the opium fiend\r\nand the alcohol bibber in other countries. By reading Colonel George\r\nKennan in his \"Tent-life in Siberia,\" and Cooke's \"Seven Sisters of\r\nSleep,\" you will find a full description of the toxic employment of this\r\nfungus which will far surpass any possible imagination.\r\n\r\nIt caused the death of the Czar Alexis of Russia; also Count de Vecchi,\r\nwith a number of his friends, in Washington in 1896. He was in search of\r\nthe Orange Amanita and found this, and the consequences were serious.\r\n\r\nIn size, shape, and color of the cap there is similarity, but in other\r\nrespects the two are very different. They may be contrasted as follows:\r\n\r\nOrange Amanita, edible.--Cap _smooth_, gills _yellow_, stem _yellow_,\r\nwrapper _persistent_, _membranaceous_, _white_.\r\n\r\nFly Amanita, poisonous.--Cap _warty_, gills _white_, stem _white_, or\r\nslightly _yellowish_, wrapper _soon breaking_ into _fragments or\r\nscales_, white or sometimes yellowish brown.\r\n\r\nFound along roadsides, wood margins, and in thin woods. It prefers poor\r\nsoil, and is more abundant where poplar and hemlock grow. From June to\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 14.--Amanita muscaria.--_Linn._ One-half natural\r\nsize, showing development of the plant.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amanita Frostiana. Pk._\r\n\r\nFROST'S AMANITA. POISONOUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 15.--Amanita Frostiana.]\r\n\r\nFrostiana, named in honor of Charles C. Frost.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is convex, expanded, bright orange or yellow, warty,\r\nsometimes smooth, striate on the margin, pileus one to three inches\r\nbroad.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free, white, or slightly tinged with yellow.\r\n\r\nThe stem is white or yellow, stuffed, bearing a slight, sometimes\r\nevanescent, ring, bulbous, at the base, the bulb slightly margined by\r\nthe volva. The spores globose, 8-10µ in diameter. _Peck._\r\n\r\nGreat care should be taken to distinguish this species from A. cæsarea\r\nbecause of its often yellow stem and gills. I found some beautiful\r\nspecimens on Cemetery Hill and on Ralston's Run. It is very poisonous\r\nand should be carefully avoided, or rather, it should be thoroughly\r\nknown that it may be avoided. The striations on the margin of its yellow\r\ntinge might lead one to mistake it for the Orange Amanita. It is found\r\nin shady woods and sometimes in open places where there is underbrush.\r\nJune to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amanita verna. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE SPRING AMANITA. POISONOUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 16.--Amanita verna. Two-thirds natural size,\r\nshowing the volva cup and the ring.]\r\n\r\nVerna, pertaining to spring. This species is considered by some only a\r\nwhite variety of Amanita phalloides. The plant is always a pure white.\r\nIt can only be distinguished from the white form of the A. phalloides by\r\nits closer sheathing volva and perhaps a more ovate pileus when young.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is at first ovate, then expanded, somewhat depressed, viscid\r\nwhen moist, even, margin naked, smooth. The gills are free.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stuffed, with advancing age hollow, equal, floccose, white,\r\nringed, base bulbous, volva closely embracing the stem with its free\r\nmargin, ring forming a broad collar, reflexed. The spores are globose,\r\n8µ broad.\r\n\r\nThis species is very abundant on the wooded hills in this section of the\r\nstate. Its pure white color makes it an attractive plant, and it should\r\nbe carefully learned. I have found it before the middle of June.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amanita magnivelaris. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE LARGE VEILED AMANITA. POISONOUS.\r\n\r\nMagnivelaris is from _magnus_, large; _velum_, a veil.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is convex, often nearly plane, with even margin, smooth,\r\nslightly viscid when moist, white or yellowish-white.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free, close, white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is long, nearly equal, white, smooth, furnished with a large\r\nmebranaceous volva, the bulbous base tapering downward and rooting. The\r\nspores are broadly elliptical.\r\n\r\nThis species very closely resembles Amanita verna, from which it can be\r\ndistinguished by its large, persistent annulus, the elongated\r\ndownward-tapering bulb of its stem, and, especially, by its elliptical\r\nspores.\r\n\r\nIt is found solitary and in the woods. I found several on Ralston's Run\r\nunder beech trees. Found from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amanita pellucidula. Ban._\r\n\r\nPileus at first campanulate, then expanded, slightly viscid, fleshy in\r\ncenter, attenuated at the margin; color a smooth bright red, deeper at\r\nthe top, shaded into clear transparent yellow at the margin; glossy,\r\nflesh white, unchanging.\r\n\r\nThe gills are ventricose, free, numerous, yellow.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stuffed, ring descending, fugacious. Peck's 44th Report.\r\n\r\nThis species differs from Amanita cæsarea in having an even margin and a\r\nwhite stem. It is only a form of the cæsarea. The white stem will\r\nattract the attention of the collector.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amanita solitaria. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE SOLITARY AMANITA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 17.--Amanita solitaria. Two-thirds natural size,\r\nshowing the peculiar veil.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 18.--Amanita solitaria. Two-thirds natural size,\r\nshowing scaly cap and stem.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate II. Figure 19.--Amanita solitaria.\r\n\r\nNatural size, showing scaly cap and stem, plant white.]\r\n\r\nSolitary, growing alone. I have found this plant in various parts of the\r\nstate and have always found them growing alone. In Poke Hollow, where I\r\nfound the specimens in the illustrations, I found several on the\r\nhillside on different occasions, but I have never found them growing in\r\ngroups. It is quite large in size, white or whitish, very woolly or\r\nfloccose. Usually the cap, stem, and the gills are covered with a\r\nfloccose substance which will serve to identify the species. This fluffy\r\nexterior adheres readily to your hands or clothing. The cap is sometimes\r\ntinged with brown, but the flesh is white and smells quite strong, not\r\nunlike chloride of lime. The annulus is frequently torn from the stem\r\nand is found adhering to the margin of the cap.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is from three to five inches broad, or more, when fully\r\nexpanded, at first globose to hemispherical, as will be seen in Figures\r\n17 and 18, convex, or plane, warty, white or whitish, the pointed scales\r\nbeing easily rubbed off, or washed off by heavy rains, these scales\r\nvarying in size from small granules to quite large conical flakes, and\r\ndiffering in condition and color in different plants.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free, or are not attached by the upper part, the edges are\r\nfrequently floccose where they are torn from the slight connection with\r\nthe upper surface of the veil; white, or slightly tinged with\r\ncream-color, broad.\r\n\r\nThe stem is four to eight inches high, solid, becoming stuffed when old,\r\nbulbous, rooting deep in the soil, very scaly, ventricose sometimes in\r\nyoung plants, white, very mealy. Volva friable. Ring, large, lacerated,\r\nusually hanging to the margin of the cap, but in Figure 19 it adheres to\r\nthe stem.\r\n\r\nThis is a large and beautiful plant in the woods, and easily identified\r\nbecause of its floccose nature and the large bulb at the base of the\r\nstem. It is not so warty and the odor is not nearly so strong as the\r\nAmanita strobiliformis. It is edible but very great caution should be\r\nused to be sure of your species. Found from July to October in woods and\r\nroadsides.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amanita radicata. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 20.--Amanita radicata. Two-thirds natural size,\r\nshowing scaly cap, bulbous stem and root broken off and peculiar veil.]\r\n\r\nRadicata means furnished with a root. The root of the specimen in Figure\r\n20 was broken off in getting it out of the ground.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is subglobose, becoming convex, dry, verrucose, white, margin\r\neven, flesh firm, white, odor resembling that of chloride of lime.\r\n\r\nThe gills are close, free, white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, deeply radicating, swollen at the base or bulbous,\r\nfloccose or mealy at the top, white; veil thin, floccose, or mealy,\r\nwhite, soon lacerated and attached in fragments to the margin of the\r\npileus or evanescent. The spores are broadly elliptic, 7.5-10µ long,\r\n6-7µ broad. _Peck._\r\n\r\nThis is quite a large and beautiful plant, very closely related to\r\nAmanita strobiliformis, but readily distinguished from it because of its\r\nwhite color, its clearly radiating stem, and small spores. The stem\r\nshows to be bulbous and the cap covered with warts. I found the plant\r\nfrequently in Poke Hollow and on Ralston's Run. July and August.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 21.--Amanita radicata.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amanita strobiliformis. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE FIR-CONE AMANITA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate III. Figure 22.--Amanita strobiliformis.\r\n\r\nYoung plant showing veil covering the entire gill-surface of the plant.\r\nCap covered with persistent warts, stem rough and rooting, odor strong\r\nof chloride of lime.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate IV. Figure 23.--Amanita strobiliformis.\r\n\r\nShowing long root.]\r\n\r\nStrobiliformis means fir-cone form; so called from the similarity of its\r\nundeveloped form to that of the strobile of the pine.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is six to eight inches broad, when young, subglobose, then\r\nconvex, expanded, nearly plane, with persistent warts, white, ash-color,\r\nsometimes yellow on the cap, the margin even and extending beyond the\r\ngills; warts hard, angular, pointed, white; flesh white, compact.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free, crowded, rounded, white, becoming yellow.\r\n\r\nThe stem is five to eight inches long, frequently longer, tapering\r\nupward, floccosely scaly, bulbous, rooting beyond the bulb; ring large,\r\ntorn; volva forming concentric rings. The spores are 13-14×8-9µ.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most stately plants in the woods. It is said to be\r\nedible, but the strong pungent odor, like chloride of lime, has deterred\r\nme from eating it. This, however, is said to disappear in cooking. It\r\ngrows to be very large. Dr. Kellerman and I found a specimen in Haynes's\r\nHollow whose stem measured over eleven inches, and cap nine inches. It\r\nis found in open woods and wood margins. Great caution should be used\r\nbefore the plant is eaten to know it beyond doubt. Found July to\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amanita mappa. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE DELICATE AMANITA. POISONOUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 24.--Amanita mappa. Natural size, showing long\r\nsmooth stem, cap yellowish-white and ring.]\r\n\r\nMappa means a napkin, so called from the volva. The pileus is two to\r\nthree inches broad, convex, then expanded, plane, obtuse or depressed,\r\nwithout separable cuticle; margin nearly even; white or yellowish,\r\nusually with patches of the volva dry.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnexed, close, narrow, shining, white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three inches long, stuffed, then hollow, cylindrical,\r\nnearly smooth, bulbous, nearly globose at the base, white, almost equal\r\nabove the bulb.\r\n\r\nThe volva with its free margin is acute and narrow. The ring is\r\nmembranaceous, superior, soft, lax, ragged.\r\n\r\nIts color is quite as variable and its habits are much like A.\r\nphalloides, from which it can only be distinguished by its less\r\ndeveloped volva, which, instead of being cup-shaped, is little more than\r\na mere rim fringing the bulb. The odor at times is very strong. It is\r\nfound in open woods and under brush. Label it poisonous.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amanita crenulata. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 25.--Amanita crenulata.]\r\n\r\nCrenulata means bearing notches, referring to the crenulate form of the\r\ngills, which are very distinct.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is thin, two to two and a half inches broad, broadly ovate,\r\nbecoming convex, or nearly plane, somewhat striate on the margin,\r\nadorned with a few thin whitish floccose warts or with whitish\r\nflocculent patches, whitish or grayish, sometimes tinged with yellow.\r\n\r\nThe gills are close, reaching the stem, and sometimes forming decurrent\r\nlines upon it, floccose crenulate on the edge, the short ones truncate\r\nat the inner extremity, white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal, bulbous, floccose mealy above, stuffed or hollow,\r\nwhite, the annulus slight, evanescent. Spores broadly elliptic or\r\nsubglobose, 7.5-10 long, nearly as broad, usually containing a single\r\nlarge nucleus. _Peck_, Bull. Tor. Bot. Club.\r\n\r\nThe stem is bulbous at the base but the volva is rarely seen upon it\r\nalthough slight patches are frequently seen on the pileus. The ring is\r\nvery evanescent and soon disappears. The specimens I have received from\r\nMrs. Blackford look good enough to eat and she speaks highly of the\r\nedible qualities of this species. So far as I know this plant is\r\nconfined to the New England states. Found from September to November. It\r\ngrows in low damp ground under trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amanita cothurnata. Atkinson._\r\n\r\nTHE BOOTED AMANITA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 26.--Amanita cothurnata. Slightly reduced from\r\nnatural size, showing different stages of development.]\r\n\r\nCothurnata means buskined; from corthunus, a high shoe or buskin worn by\r\nactors. This species is easily separated from the other Amanitas. I\r\nshall give Prof. Atkinson's description of it in full: \"The pileus is\r\nfleshy and passes from nearly globose to hemispherical, convex,\r\nexpanded, and when specimens are very old sometimes the margin is\r\nelevated. It is usually white, though specimens are found with a tinge\r\nof citron yellow in the center or of tawny yellow in the center of other\r\nspecimens. The pileus is viscid, strongly so when moist. It is finely\r\nstriate on the margin, and covered with numerous, white, floccose scales\r\nfrom the upper half of the volva, forming more or less dense patches,\r\nwhich may wash off in heavy rains.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rounded next the stem, and quite remote from it. The edge\r\nof the gills is often eroded or frazzly from the torn-out threads with\r\nwhich they were loosely connected to the upper side of the veil in the\r\nyoung or button stage. The spores are globose or nearly so, with a large\r\n\"nucleus\" nearly filling the spore.\r\n\r\nThe stem is cylindrical, even, and expanded below into quite a large\r\noval bulb, the stem just above the bulb being margined by a\r\nclose-fitting roll of the volva, and the upper edge of this presenting\r\nthe appearance of having been sewed at the top like the rolled edge of a\r\ngarment or buskin. The surface of the stem is minutely floccose, scaly\r\nor strongly so, and decidedly hollow even from a very young stage or\r\nsometimes when young with loose threads in the cavity.\r\n\r\nA. cothurnata resembles in many points A. frostiana and it will afford\r\nthe collector a very interesting study to note the points of difference.\r\nI found the two species growing on Cemetery Hill. Figure 26 is from\r\nplants collected in Michigan and photographed by Dr. Fisher. Found in\r\nSeptember and October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amanita rubescens. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE REDDISH AMANITA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 27.--Amanita rubescens. One-third natural size,\r\ncaps a dingy reddish-brown, stains reddish when bruised.]\r\n\r\nRubescens is from _rubesco_, to become red. It is so called because of\r\nthe dingy reddish color of the entire plant, and also because when the\r\nplant is handled or bruised it quickly changes to a reddish color. It is\r\noften a large bulky plant and rather uninviting.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is four to six inches broad, dingy reddish, often becoming\r\npale flesh color, fleshy, oval to convex, then expanded; sprinkled with\r\nsmall pale warts, unequal, mealy, scattered, white, easily separating;\r\nmargin even, faintly striate, especially in wet weather; flesh soft,\r\nwhite, becoming red when broken.\r\n\r\nThe gills are white or whitish, free from the stem but reaching it and\r\nforming at times decurrent lines upon it, thin, crowded.\r\n\r\nThe stem is four or five inches long, nearly cylindrical, solid, though\r\ninclined to be soft within, tapering from the base up, with a bulbous\r\nbase which often tapers abruptly below, containing reddish scales, color\r\ndull red. It has seldom any distinct evidence of a volva at the base but\r\nabundant evidence on the cap. Ring large, superior, white, and fragile.\r\n\r\nThe plant is quite variable in color, sometimes becoming almost white\r\nwith a slight reddish or brownish tint. The strong distinguishing\r\ncharacter of the species is the almost entire absence of any remains of\r\nthe volva at the base of the stem. By this, and by the dull red hues and\r\nthe bruised portions quickly changing to a reddish color, it is easily\r\ndistinguished from any of the poisonous Amanitas.\r\n\r\nAccording to Cordier it is largely used as an article of food in France.\r\nStevenson and Cooke speak well of it. I noticed the small Bohemian boys\r\ngathered it about Salem, Ohio, not having been in this country more than\r\na week and not being able to speak a word of English. It convinced me\r\nthat it was an article of diet in Bohemia and that our species is\r\nsimilar to theirs. I have found the plants in woods about Bowling Green\r\nand Sidney, Ohio. The plants in Figure 27 were collected on Johnson's\r\nIsland, Sandusky, Ohio, and photographed by Dr. Kellerman. It is found\r\nfrom June to September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amanita aspera. Fr._\r\n\r\nROUGH AMANITA.\r\n\r\nAspera means rough. The pileus is convex, then plane; warts minute,\r\nsomewhat crowded, nearly persistent; margin even, rather thin,\r\nincreasing in thickness toward the stem; scarcely umbonate, reddish with\r\nvarious tints of livid and gray; flesh rather solid, white, with tints\r\nof reddish-brown immediately next to the epidermis.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free, with sometimes a little tooth behind, running down\r\nthe stem, white, broad in front.\r\n\r\nThe stem is white, squamulose, bulb rugulose, ring superior and entire.\r\nThe spores are 8×6µ.\r\n\r\nWhen the flesh is bruised or eaten by insects it assumes a reddish-brown\r\ncolor, and in this respect it resembles A. rubescens. The odor is strong\r\nbut the taste is not unpleasant. In woods from June till October. The\r\ncollector should be sure he knows the plant before he eats it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amanita cæsarea. Scop._\r\n\r\nTHE ORANGE AMANITA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 28.--Amanita cæsarea. From a drawing showing the\r\ndifferent stages of the plant. Caps, gills, stem and collar yellow,\r\nvolva white.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by H. C. Beardslee._\r\n\r\nFigure 29.--Amanita cæsarea.]\r\n\r\nThe Orange Amanita is a large, attractive, and beautiful plant. I have\r\nmarked it edible, but no one should eat it unless he is thoroughly\r\nacquainted with all the species of the genus Amanita, and then with\r\ngreat caution. It is said to have been Cæsar's favorite mushroom. The\r\npileus is smooth, hemispherical, bell-shaped, convex, and when fully\r\nexpanded nearly flat, the center somewhat elevated and the margin\r\nslightly curved downward; red or orange, fading to yellow on the margin;\r\nusually the larger and well-developed specimens have the deeper and\r\nricher color, the color being always more marked in the center of the\r\npileus; margin distinctly striate; gills rounded at the stem end and not\r\nattached to the stem, yellow, free and straight. The color of the gills\r\nof matured plants usually is an index to the color of the spores but it\r\nis an exception in this case as the spores are white.\r\n\r\nThe stem and the flabby membranaceous collar that surrounds it toward\r\nthe top are yellow like the gills, the depth of the color varying more\r\nwith the size of the plant than is the case with color of the cap.\r\nSometimes in small and inferior plants the color of both stem and gills\r\nis nearly white, and if the volva is not distinct it is difficult to\r\ndistinguish it from the fly mushroom, which is very poisonous. The stem\r\nis hollow, with a soft cottony pith in the young plants.\r\n\r\nIn very young plants the edge of the collar is attached to the margin of\r\nthe cap and conceals the gills, but with the upward growth of the stem\r\nand the expansion of the cap the collar separates from the margin and\r\nremains attached to the stem, where it hangs down upon it like a ruffle.\r\n\r\nThe expanded cap is usually from three to six inches broad, the stem\r\nfrom four to six inches long and tapering upward.\r\n\r\nWhen in the button stage, the plant is ovate; and the white color of the\r\nvolva, which now entirely surrounds the plant, presents an appearance\r\nmuch like a hen's egg in size, color, and shape. As the parts within\r\ndevelop, the volva ruptures in its upper part, the stem elongates and\r\ncarries upward the cap, while the remains of the volva surrounds the\r\nbase of the stem in the form of a cup.\r\n\r\nWhen the volva first breaks at the apex, it reveals the point of the cap\r\nwith its beautiful red color and in contrast with the white volva makes\r\nquite a pretty plant, but with advancing age the red or orange red fades\r\nto a yellow. In drying the specimens the red often entirely disappears.\r\nIn young, as well as in old plants, the margin is often prominently\r\nmarked with striations, as will be seen in Figures 28 and 29. The flesh\r\nof the plant is white but more or less stained with yellow next to the\r\nepidermis and the gills, which are of that color.\r\n\r\nThe plant grows in wet weather from July to October. It grows in thin\r\nwoods and seems to prefer pine woods and sandy soil. I have found it\r\nfrom the south tier of counties to the north of our state. It is not,\r\nhowever, a common plant in Ohio.\r\n\r\nFrom its several names--Cæsar's Agaric, Imperial Mushroom, Cibus Deorum,\r\nKaiserling--one would infer that for ages it had been held in high\r\nesteem as an esculent.\r\n\r\nToo great caution cannot be used in distinguishing it from the very\r\npoisonous fly mushroom.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amanita spreta. Pk._\r\n\r\nHATED AMANITA. POISONOUS.\r\n\r\nSpreta, hated. The pileus at first is nearly ovate, slightly umbonate,\r\nthen convex, smooth, sometimes fragments of the volva adhering, the\r\nmargin striate, whitish or pale-brown toward and on the umbo, soft, dry,\r\nmore or less furrowed on the margin.\r\n\r\nThe flesh is white, thin on the edges, and increasing in thickness\r\ntoward the center. Gills close, white, reaching the stem.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal, smooth, annulate, stuffed or hollow, whitish, finely\r\nstriate at the top from the decurrent lines of the gills, not bulbous at\r\nthe base, the volva rather large and inclined to yellowish color. The\r\nspores are elliptical.\r\n\r\nThe plant resembles the dark forms of the Amanitopsis in having the\r\nmarked striations and the entire and closely fitting volva at the base,\r\nbut can be easily distinguished by its ring. I found it on Cemetery Hill\r\nin company with the Amanitopsis. It does not seem to root as deep in the\r\nground as the Amanitopsis. It is very poisonous and should be carefully\r\nstudied so that it may be readily recognized and avoided.\r\n\r\nIt is found in open woods from July to September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amanitopsis. Roze._\r\n\r\nAmanitopsis is from _Aminita_ and _opsis_, resembling; so called because\r\nit resembles the Amanita. The principal feature wherein the genus\r\ndiffers from the Amanita is the absence of a collar on the stem. Its\r\nspecies are included among the Amanita by many authors. The spores are\r\nwhite. The gills are free from the stem, and it has a universal veil at\r\nfirst completely enveloping the young plant, which soon breaks it,\r\ncarrying remnants of it on the pileus, where they appear as scattered\r\nwarts. It differs from the Lepiota in having a volva.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amanitopsis vaginata. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE SHEATHED AMANITOPSIS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 30.--Amanita vaginata. One-third natural size.\r\nNotice a portion of the volva adhering to the cap.]\r\n\r\nVaginata--from _vagina_, a sheath. The plant is edible but should be\r\nused with very great caution. It is quite variable in color, ranging\r\nfrom white to mouse color, brownish or yellowish.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is ovate at first, bell-shaped, then convex and expanded,\r\nthin, quite fragile, smooth, when young with a few fragments of the\r\nvolva adhering to its surface, deeply and distinctly striate.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free, white, then pallid, ventricose, broadest in front,\r\nirregular. The flesh is white, but in the darker forms stained under the\r\neasily separating skin. The spores are white and nearly round, 7-10µ.\r\n\r\nThe stem is cylindrical, even or slightly tapering upward, hollow or\r\nstuffed, smooth or sprinkled with downy scales, not bulbous at the base.\r\n\r\nThe volva is long, thin, fragile, forming a permanent sheath which is\r\nquite soft and readily adheres to the base of the stem.\r\n\r\nThe striations on the margin are deep and distinct, as in the Orange\r\nAmanita. The cup is quite regular but it is fragile, easily broken and\r\nusually deep in the ground. In some plants a slight umbo is developed at\r\nthe center.\r\n\r\nThe mushroom-eater wants to distinguish very carefully between this\r\nspecies and Amanita spreta, which is very poisonous.\r\n\r\nIt is found in woods, in open places where there is much vegetable\r\nmould, sometimes found in stubble and pastures, especially in meadows\r\nunder trees. Found from June to November.\r\n\r\nThe plant varies considerably in color, and there are several varieties,\r\nseparable by means of their color:\r\n\r\nA. vaginata, var. alba. The whole plant is white.\r\n\r\nA. vaginata var. fulva. The cap tawny yellow or pale ochraceous.\r\n\r\nA. vaginata var. livida. The cap leaden brown; gills and stem tinged\r\nwith smoky brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate V. Figure 31.--Amanita vaginata]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Amanitopsis strangulata. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE GRAY AMANITOPSIS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nStrangulata means choked, from the stuffed stem. The pileus is two to\r\nfour inches broad, soon plane, livid-bay or gray, with patches of the\r\nvolva, margin striate or grooved.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free, white, close.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stuffed, silky above, scaly below, slightly tapering\r\nupwards. The volva soon breaking up, forming several ring-like ridges on\r\nthe stem. The spores are globose, 10-13µ.\r\n\r\nThis is a synonym for A. ceciliae. B. and Br. and perhaps nothing more\r\nthan a vigorous growth of Amanitopsis vaginata. It has almost no odor\r\nand a sweet taste and cooks deliciously.\r\n\r\nFound in the woods and in open places from August to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lepiota. Fr._\r\n\r\nLepiota means a scale. In the Lepiota the gills are typically free from\r\nthe stem, as in Amanita and Amanitopsis, but they differ in having no\r\nsuperficial or removable warts on the cap, and no sheathing or scaly\r\nremains of a volva at the base of the stem. In some species the\r\nepidermis of the cap breaks into scales which persistently adhere to the\r\ncap, and this feature, indeed, suggests the name of the genus, which is\r\nderived from the Latin word _lepis_, a scale.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow or stuffed, its flesh being distinct from the pileus\r\nand easily separable from it. There are a number of edible species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lepiota procera. Scop._\r\n\r\nTHE PARASOL MUSHROOM. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate VI. Figure 32.--Lepiota procera.]\r\n\r\nProcera means tall.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is thin, strongly umbonate, adorned with brown spot-like\r\nscales.\r\n\r\nThe gills are white, sometimes yellowish-white, free, remote from the\r\nstem, broad and crowded, ventricose, edge sometimes brownish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is very long, cylindrical, hollow or stuffed, even, very long\r\nin proportion to its thickness and is, therefore, suggestive of the\r\nspecific name, procera. The ring is rather thick and firm, though in\r\nmature plants it becomes loosened and movable on the stem. This and the\r\nform of the plant suggest the name, parasol. The cap is from three to\r\nfive inches broad and the stem from five to nine inches high. I found\r\none specimen among fallen timber that was eleven inches tall and whose\r\ncap was six inches broad.\r\n\r\nIt has a wide distribution. It is found in all parts of Ohio but is not\r\nabundant anywhere. It is a favorite with those who have eaten it, and,\r\nindeed, it is a delicious morsel when quickly broiled over coals,\r\nseasoned to taste with salt and pepper, butter melted in the gills and\r\nserved on toast. This mushroom is especially free from grubs and it can\r\nbe dried for winter use.\r\n\r\nThere is no poisonous species with which one is likely to confound it.\r\nThe very tall, slender stem with a bulbous base, the very peculiar\r\nspotted cap with the prominent dark colored umbo and the movable ring on\r\nthe stem, are ear-marks sufficient to identify this species.\r\n\r\nSpores white and elliptical, 14×10µ. Lloyd. It is found in pastures,\r\nstubble, and among fallen timber. July to October.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to C. G. Lloyd for the photograph given here.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lepiota naucina. Fr._\r\n\r\nSMOOTH LEPIOTA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 33.--Lepiota naucina. The entire plant white.]\r\n\r\nPileus soft, smooth, white or smoky-white; gills free, white, slowly\r\nchanging with age to a dirty pinkish-brown color; stem annulate,\r\nslightly thickened at the base, attenuated upward, clothed with fibres\r\npure white. The Smooth Lepiota is generally very regular in shape and of\r\na pure white color. The central part of the cap is sometimes tinged with\r\nyellow or a smoky white hue. Its surface is nearly always very smooth\r\nand even. The gills are somewhat narrower toward the stem than they are\r\nin the middle. They are rounded and not attached to the stem.\r\n\r\nCap two to four inches broad; stem two to three inches long. It grows in\r\nclean grassy places in lawn, pastures, and along roadsides. I have seen\r\nthe roadside white with this species around Sidney, Ohio. The specimens\r\nrepresented in figure were found in Chillicothe, August to November.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the best mushrooms, not inferior to the meadow mushroom.\r\nIt has this advantage over the former that the gills retain their white\r\ncolor and do not pass from a pink to a repulsive black. The halftone and\r\nthe description ought to make the plant known to the most casual reader.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lepiota americana. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN LEPIOTA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 34.--Lepiota americana. Center of disk red or\r\nreddish-brown, stem frequently swollen. Plant turning red when drying.]\r\n\r\nThis plant is quite common about Chillicothe, especially upon sawdust\r\npiles. It grows both singly and in clusters. The umbonate cap is adorned\r\nwith reddish or reddish-brown scales except on the center where the\r\ncolor is uniformly reddish or reddish-brown because the surface is not\r\nbroken up into scales; gills close, free, white, ventricose; stem\r\nsmooth, enlarged at the base. In some plants the base of the stem is\r\nabnormally large; ring white, inclined to be delicate.\r\n\r\nWounds and bruises are apt to assume brownish-red hues. Dr. Herbst says:\r\n\"This is truly an American plant, not being found in any other country.\r\nThis is the pride of the family. There is nothing more beautiful than a\r\ncluster of this fungi. To look over the beautiful scaly pileus is a\r\nsight equally as fascinating as a covey of quail.\"\r\n\r\nFound in grassy lawns and on old sawdust piles, in common with Pluteus\r\ncervinus. It is found almost all over the state. It is quite equal to\r\nthe Parasol mushroom in flavor. It has a tendency to turn the milk or\r\ncream in which it is cooked to a reddish color. It is found from June to\r\nOctober. Mr. Lloyd suggests the name Lepiota Bodhami. It is the same as\r\nthe European plant L. hæmatosperma. Bull.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lepiota Morgani. Pk._\r\n\r\nIN HONOR OF PROF. MORGAN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate VII. Figure 35.--Lepiota morgani.\r\n\r\nEntire plant white or brownish-white. Gills white at first then\r\ngreenish.]\r\n\r\nPileus fleshy, soft, at first subglobose, then expanded or even\r\ndepressed, white, the brownish or yellowish cuticule breaking up into\r\nscales on the disk; gills close, lanceolate, remote, white, then green;\r\nstem firm, equal or tapering upward, subbulbous, smooth, webby-stuffed,\r\nwhitish tinged with brown; ring rather large, movable as you will\r\nobserve in Figure 35. Flesh of both pileus and stem white, changing to a\r\nreddish, then to yellowish hue when cut or bruised. Spores ovate or\r\nsubelliptical, mostly uninucleate, sordid green. 10-13×7-8. Peck.\r\n\r\nThis plant is very abundant about Chillicothe and I found it equally so\r\nat Sidney. I have known several families to eat of it, making about half\r\nof the children in each family sick. I regard it as a dangerous plant to\r\neat. It grows very large and I have seen it growing in well marked rings\r\na rod in diameter. If you are in doubt whether the plant you have is\r\nMorgani or not, let it remain in the basket over night and you will\r\nplainly see that the gills are turning green. The gills are white until\r\nthe spores begin to fall. The plant is found in pastures and sometimes\r\nin pasture woods. June to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lepiota granulosa. Batsch._\r\n\r\nGRAINY LEPIOTA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nGranulosa--from granosus, full of grains. Pileus thin, convex or nearly\r\nplain, sometimes almost umbonate, rough, with numerous granular scales,\r\noften radiately wrinkled, rusty-yellow or reddish-yellow, often growing\r\npaler with age. Flesh white or reddish tinged. Gills close, rounded\r\nbehind and usually slightly adnexed, white. Stem equal or slightly\r\nthickened at the base, stuffed or hollow, white above the ring, colored\r\nand adorned like the pileus below it. Ring slight and evanescent. Spores\r\nelliptical, .00016 to .0002 inch long, .00012 to .00014 inch broad.\r\n\r\nPlant one to two and one-fifth inches high; pileus one to two and\r\none-fifth inches broad; stem one to three lines thick. Common in woods,\r\ncopses, and waste places. August to October.\r\n\r\n\"This is a small species with a short stem and granular reddish-yellow\r\npileus, and gills slightly attached to the stem. The annulus is very\r\nsmall and fugacious, being little more than the abrupt termination to\r\nthe coating of the stem. The species was formerly made to include\r\nseveral varieties which are now regarded as distinct.\"--Peck's Report.\r\n\r\nFound in the open woods about Salem, Ohio. The plant is small but quite\r\nmeaty and of a pleasing quality.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lepiota cristatella. Pk._\r\n\r\nPileus thin, convex, subumbonate, minutely mealy, especially on the\r\nmargin, white disk slightly tinged with pink.\r\n\r\nGills close, rounded behind, free, white; stem slender, whitish, hollow;\r\nspores subelliptical, .0002 inch long.\r\n\r\nMossy places in woods. October.--_Peck's Report_. No one will fail to\r\nrecognize the crested Lepiota the moment he sees it. It has many of the\r\near marks of the Lepiota family.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lepiota granosa. Morg._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate VIII. Figure 36.--Lepiota granosa.]\r\n\r\nGranosa means covered with granules.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is convex, obtuse or umbonate, even, radiately\r\nrugose-wrinkled, generally even and regular on the margin,\r\nreddish-yellow or light bay.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, slightly decurrent, somewhat\r\ncrowded, whitish, then reddish-yellow.\r\n\r\nThe stem is thickened at the base, tapering toward the cap, flesh of the\r\nstem is yellow. The veil is membranous and forms a persistent ring on\r\nthe stem.\r\n\r\nIt grows on decayed wood. I found it in large quantities, and tried to\r\nmake it L. granulosa, but I found it fit better L. amianthinus, which it\r\nresembles very closely, but it is much larger and its habit is not the\r\nsame. I was not satisfied with this description and sent the specimens\r\nto Prof. Atkinson, who set me right. It is a beautiful plant found on\r\ndecayed wood in September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lepiota cepæstipes. Sow._\r\n\r\nTHE ONION STEMMED LEPIOTA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 37.--Lepiota cepæstipes. Pileus thin, white or\r\nyellowish.]\r\n\r\nCepæstipes is from cepa, an onion and stipes, a stem, Pileus is thin at\r\nfirst ovate, then bell-shaped or expanded, umbonate, soon adorned with\r\nnumerous minute brownish scales, which are often granular or mealy,\r\nfolded into lines on the margin, white or yellow, the umbo darker.\r\n\r\nThe gills are thin, close, free, white, becoming dingy with age or\r\ndrying.\r\n\r\nThe stem is rather long, tapering toward the apex, generally enlarged in\r\nthe middle or near the base, hollow. The ring is thin and subpersistent.\r\nThe spores are subelliptical, with a single nucleus, 8-10×5-8µ.\r\n\r\nThe plants often cespitose, two to four inches high. Pileus is one to\r\ntwo inches broad. It is found in rich ground and decomposing vegetable\r\nmatter. It is also found in graperies and conservatories. _Peck._\r\n\r\nThis plant derives its specific name from the resemblance of its stem to\r\nthat of the seed-stalk of an onion. One form has a yellow or yellowish\r\ncap, while the other has a white or fair cap. It seems to delight to\r\ngrow in well rotted sawdust piles and hot houses. The specimens\r\nrepresented in Figure 37 were collected in Cleveland and photographed by\r\nProf. H. C. Beardslee.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lepiota acutesquamosa. Wein._\r\n\r\nTHE SQUARROSE LEPIOTA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 38.--Lepiota acutesquamosa. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize, showing small pointed scales.]\r\n\r\nAcutesquamosa is from _acutus_, sharp, and _squama_, a scale; so called\r\nfrom the many bristling, erect scales on the pileus. The pileus is two\r\nto three inches broad, fleshy, convex, obtuse, or broadly umbonate; pale\r\nrusty with numerous small pointed scales, which are usually larger and\r\nmore numerous at the disk.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free, crowded, simple, white or yellowish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three inches or more long; stuffed or hollow,\r\ntapering upward slightly from a swollen base; below the ring rough or\r\nsilky, pruinose above, ring large. The spores are 7-8×4µ.\r\n\r\nThey are found in the woods, in gardens, and frequently in greenhouses.\r\nThere is a slight difference between the specimens growing in the woods\r\nand those in the greenhouse. In the latter the pubescent covering is\r\nless dense and the erect scales are more numerous than in the former. In\r\nolder specimens these scales fall off and leave small scars on the cap\r\nwhere they were attached. The specimens in Figure 38 were gathered in\r\nMichigan and were photographed by Dr. Fisher of Detroit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Armillaria. Fr._\r\n\r\nArmillaria, from armilla, a bracelet--referring to the ring upon the\r\nstem. This genus differs from all the foregoing white-spored species in\r\nhaving the gills attached to the stem by their inner extremity. The\r\nspores are white and the stem has a collar, though a somewhat evanescent\r\none, but no wrapper at the base of the stem as in the Amanita and\r\nAmanitopsis. By the collar the genus differs from the other genera which\r\nare to follow.\r\n\r\nThe Amanita and Lepiota have the flesh of the stem and the pileus not\r\ncontinuous, and their stems are, therefore, easily separated from the\r\ncap, but in the Armillaria the gills and the pileus are attached to the\r\nstem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Armillaria mellea. Vahl._\r\n\r\nTHE HONEY-COLORED ARMILLARIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 39.--Armillaria mellea. Two-thirds natural size.\r\nHoney colored. Tufted with dark-brown fugitive hairs. Flesh white.]\r\n\r\nMellea, from melleus, of the color of honey. Cap fleshy, honey colored,\r\nor ochraceous, striate on the margin, shaded with darker brown toward\r\nthe center, having a central boss-like elevation and sometimes a central\r\ndepression in full grown specimens, tufted with dark-brown fugitive\r\nhairs. Color of the cap varies, depending upon climatic conditions and\r\nthe character of the habitat. Gills distant, ending in a decurrent\r\ntooth, pallid or dirty white, very often showing brown or rust colored\r\nspots when old. Spores white and abundant. Frequently the ground under a\r\nclump of this species will be white from the fallen spores. Stem elastic\r\nand scaly, four inches or more in length. Ring downy. Diameter of cap\r\nfrom two to five inches. Manner of growth is frequently in tufts, and,\r\nas with most of the Armillarias, generally parasitic on old stumps.\r\n\r\nThe veil varies greatly. It may be membranaceous and thin, or quite\r\nthick, or may be wanting entirely, as will be seen in Figure 39; in\r\nFigure 40 only a slight trace of the ring can be seen. The two plants\r\ngrew under very different environment; the last grew in the woods and\r\nFigure 39 on a lawn in the city. The species is very common and grows\r\neither in thin woods or in cleared lands, on the ground or on decaying\r\nwood. Its favorite habit is about stumps. It is either solitary,\r\ngregarious, or in dense clusters. It is very abundant about Chillicothe,\r\nwhere I have seen stumps literally surrounded with it. It has a slight\r\nacridity while raw, which it seems to lose in cooking. Those who like it\r\nmay eat it without fear, all varieties being edible.\r\n\r\nProf. Peck gives the following varieties:\r\n\r\nA. mellea var. obscura--has the cap covered with numerous small black\r\nscales.\r\n\r\nA. mellea var. flava--has a cap yellow or reddish-yellow, otherwise\r\nnormal.\r\n\r\nA. mellea var. glabra--has a smooth cap, otherwise normal.\r\n\r\nA. mellea var. radicata--has a tapering root penetrating the soil.\r\n\r\nA. mellea var. bulbosa--has a bulbous base.\r\n\r\nA. mellea var. exannulata--has the cap smooth and even on the margin,\r\nand the stem tapering at the base.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 40.--Armillaria mellea. Two-thirds natural size,\r\nshowing double ring present.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Armillaria bulbigera. A. & S._\r\n\r\nMARGINATE-BULBED ARMILLARIA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 41.--Armillaria bulbigera. Reddish-gray caps and\r\nshort bulbous stems.]\r\n\r\nBulbigera is from _bulbus_, a bulb, and _gero_, to bear.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, three to four inches across, convex, then\r\nexpanded, obtuse, even, brownish, gray, sometimes reddish, dry,\r\nfibrillose near the margin.\r\n\r\nThe gills are notched at the stem, pallid, crowded at first, at length\r\nrather distant, becoming slightly colored.\r\n\r\nThe stem is distinctly bulbous, two to three inches long, stuffed,\r\npallid, fibrillose, ring oblique, fugacious. The spores are 7-10×5µ.\r\n\r\nI have found some very fine specimens in Poke Hollow, near Chillicothe.\r\nThe stems were short and very bulbous, having hardly any trace of the\r\nring on the older specimens. The caps were obtusely convex and of a\r\ngrayish rufescent color. This species can readily be distinguished by\r\nthe distinctly marginate bulb at the base of the stem. The specimens in\r\nFigure 41 were found in Poke Hollow, near Chillicothe, October 2d. I\r\nhave no doubt of their edibility but I have not eaten them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Armillaria nardosmia. Ellis._\r\n\r\nSPIKENARD-SMELLING ARMILLARIA. ELLIS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 42.--Armillaria nardosmia. One-half natural size,\r\nshowing the veil and incurved margin.]\r\n\r\nNardosmia is from _nardosmius_, the odor of nardus or spikenard.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is quite thick, firm and compact, thinner toward the margin,\r\nstrongly involute when young, grayish white and beautifully variegated\r\nwith brown spots, like the breast of a pheasant, rather tough, with a\r\nseparable epidermis, flesh white.\r\n\r\nThe gills are crowded, slightly notched or emarginate, somewhat\r\nventricose, white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, short, fibrous, sheathed by a veil forming a ring\r\nmore or less evanescent. The spores are nearly round, 6µ in diameter.\r\n\r\nThis is the most beautiful species of the genus, and from its\r\npheasant-like spotted cap, as well as its strong odor and taste of\r\nspikenard or almonds, it is easily determined. The almond taste and odor\r\ndisappears in cooking. I found some very fine specimens around a pond in\r\nMr. Shriver's woods, east of Chillicothe. In older specimens the\r\ncuticule of the caps frequently breaks into scales. Found in woods in\r\nSeptember and October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Armillaria appendiculata. Pk._\r\n\r\nAppendiculata, bearing small appendages. Pileus is broadly convex,\r\nglabrous, whitish, often tinged with rust-color or brownish rust-color\r\non the disk. Flesh white or whitish. Gills close, rounded behind,\r\nwhitish. Stem equal or slightly tapering upward, solid, bulbous,\r\nwhitish, the veil either membraneous or webby, white, commonly adhering\r\nin fragments to the margin of the pileus. Spores subelliptical, 8×5.\r\n\r\nPileus two to four inches broad. Stem 1.5-3.5 inches long; 5-10 lines\r\nthick.\r\n\r\nThe general appearance of this species is suggestive of Tricholoma\r\nalbum, but the appearance of a veil separates it from that fungus and\r\nplaces it in the genus Armillaria. The veil, however, is often slightly\r\nlacerated, or webby, and adherent to the margin of the pileus. Peck's\r\nReport.\r\n\r\nI have found this at Salem and Chillicothe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma. Fr._\r\n\r\nTricholoma is from two Greek words meaning hair and fringe. This genus\r\nis known by its stout, fleshy stem, without any evidence of a ring, and\r\nby the gills being attached to the stem and having a notch in their\r\nedges near or at the extremity. The veil is absent, or, if present, it\r\nis downy and adherent to the margin of the cap. The cap is generally\r\nquite fleshy; the stem is homogeneous and confluent with the pileus,\r\ncentral and nearly fleshy, without either ring or volva, and with no\r\ndistinct bark-like coat. The spores are white or grayish-white.\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing features are the fleshy stem, continuous with the\r\nflesh of the pileus, and the sinuate or notched gills. This is quite a\r\nuniversal genus. All the species grow on the ground, so far as I know\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThere are many edible species under this genus, there being only two, so\r\nfar as I know, not edible; and no one is likely to touch those on\r\naccount of their strong odor. They are T. sulphureum and T. saponaceum.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma transmutans. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE CHANGING TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nTransmutans means changing, from changes of color in both stem and gills\r\nin different stages of the plant. This species has a cap two to four\r\ninches broad, viscid or sticky when moist. It is at first tawny-brown,\r\nespecially with advancing age. The flesh is white and has a decided\r\nfarinaceous odor and taste.\r\n\r\nThe gills are crowded, rather narrow, sometimes branched, becoming\r\nreddish-spotted with age.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal or slightly tapering upward; bare, or slightly\r\nsilky-fibrillose; stuffed or hollow; whitish, often marked with reddish\r\nstains or becoming reddish-brown toward the base, white within. Spores\r\nsubglobose, 5µ.\r\n\r\nThe species grows in woods and open places, also in clover pastures,\r\neither singly or in tufts. I have seen large tufts of them, and in that\r\ncase the caps are more or less irregular on account of their crowded\r\ncondition. I found it frequently about Salem, and this fall, 1905, I\r\nfound it quite plentiful in a clover pasture near Chillicothe. Found in\r\nwet weather from August to September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma equestre. Linn._\r\n\r\nTHE KNIGHTLY TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 43.--Tricholoma equestre.]\r\n\r\nEquestre means belonging to a horseman; so called from its distinguished\r\nappearance in the woods.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is three to five inches broad, fleshy, compact, convex,\r\nexpanded, obtuse, viscid, scaly, margin incurved at first, pale\r\nyellowish, with sometimes a slight tinge of green in both cap and gills.\r\nFlesh white or tinged with yellow.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free, crowded, rounded behind, yellow.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stout, solid, pale yellow or white, white within. The spores\r\nare 7-8×5µ.\r\n\r\nIt differs from T. coryphæum in having gills entirely yellow, while the\r\nedges only of the latter are yellow. It differs from T. sejunctum in the\r\nlatter having pure white gills and a more slender stem.\r\n\r\nIt is found but occasionally here, and then only a specimen or two. It\r\nis an attractive plant and no one would pass it in the woods without\r\nadmiring it. Found from August to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma sordidum. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 44.--Tricholoma sordidum.]\r\n\r\nSordidum means dingy, dirty.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to three inches broad, rather tough, fleshy, convex,\r\nbell-shaped, then depressed, subumbonate, smooth, hygrophanous, margin\r\nslightly striate, brownish lilac, then dusky.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rounded, rather crowded, dingy violet then dusky, notched\r\nwith a decurrent tooth.\r\n\r\nThe stem is colored like the pileus, fibrillose striate, usually\r\nslightly curved, stuffed, short, often thickened at the base.\r\n\r\nThe spores are 7-8×3-4, minutely rugulose.\r\n\r\nThis species differs from T. nudum in being smaller, tougher, and often\r\nhygrophanous.\r\n\r\nIt is found in richly manured gardens, about manure piles, and in\r\nhot-houses. The specimens in Figure 44 were found in a hot-house near\r\nBoston, Mass., and sent to me by Mrs. E. Blackford. They are found in\r\nSeptember and October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma grammopodium. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE GROOVED STEM TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 45.--Tricholoma grammopodium. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nGrammopodium is from two Greek words meaning _line_ and _foot_.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is three to six inches broad, flesh thick at the center, thin\r\nat the margin, solid yet tender; brownish, blackish-umber, almost a\r\ndingy-lavender when moist, whitish when dry; at first bell-shaped, then\r\nconvex, sometimes slightly wavy, obtusely umbonate; margin at first\r\ninclined to be involute, and extending beyond the gills.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, broadly notched as will be seen in\r\nthe specimen, closely crowded, quite entire, shorter ones numerous, a\r\nfew branched, white or whitish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is three to four inches long, thickened at the base, smooth,\r\nfirm, longitudinally grooved from which it gets its specific name,\r\nwhitish.\r\n\r\nThe spores are nearly round, 5-6µ.\r\n\r\nIt closely resembles T. fuligineum but can be distinguished by the\r\ngrooved stem and crowded gills. The specimens in Figure 45 were found\r\nnear Boston, and were sent to me by Mrs. Blackford. The plants keep well\r\nand are easily dried. They were found the first of June. They have an\r\nexcellent flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma pædidum. Fr._\r\n\r\nPaedidum means nasty, stinking.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is small, about one and a half inches broad, rather fleshy,\r\ntough; convex, then flattened, soon depressed around the conical umbo;\r\nfibrillose, becoming smooth; smoky gray, somewhat streaked; moist;\r\nmargin involute, naked.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnexed, crowded, narrow, white, then grayish, somewhat\r\nsinuate with a slight decurrent tooth.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, slightly striate, dingy gray, thickened at the base.\r\nThe spores are elliptical or fusiform, 10-11×5-6µ.\r\n\r\nThe specific name, \"nasty\" or \"stinking,\" has really no application to\r\nthe plant. It is said to be very good when cooked. It is found in well\r\nmanured gardens and fields, or about manure piles.\r\n\r\nIt differs from T. sordidum in having no trace of violet color. T.\r\nlixivium differs in the free truncate gills.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma lixivium. Fr._\r\n\r\nLixivium means made into lye; hence, of the color of ashes and water.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to three inches broad; flesh thin; convex then plane;\r\numbonate, never depressed; even; smooth; grayish-brown when moist, then\r\number; margin membranaceous, at length slightly striate, sometimes wavy.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rounded behind and adnexed, free, soft, distant, often\r\ncrisped, gray.\r\n\r\nThe stem is about two inches long, fibrous, hollow, or stuffed, equal,\r\nat first covered with a white down, fragile, gray.\r\n\r\nThe spores are elliptical, 7×4-5µ.\r\n\r\nThe umbonate pileus and the nearly free, broad, gray gills will\r\ndistinguish it. They are a late grower and are found under pine trees in\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma sulphureum. Bull._\r\n\r\nSULPHURY TRICHOLOMA. POISONOUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 46.--Tricholoma sulphureum.]\r\n\r\nSulphureum, sulphur; so called from the general color of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one to three inches broad, fleshy, convex, then expanded,\r\nplane, slightly umbonate, sometimes depressed, or flexuous and\r\nirregular, margin at first involute, dingy or reddish-yellow, at first\r\nsilky, becoming smooth and even.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rather thick, narrowed behind, emarginate or acutely\r\nadnate, sulphur-colored.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to four inches long, somewhat bulbous, sometimes curved,\r\nfrequently slightly striate; stuffed, often hollow; sulphur-yellow,\r\nyellow within; furnished at the base occasionally with many rather\r\nstrong, yellow, fibrous roots. Odor strong and disagreeable. Flesh thick\r\nand yellow. Spores are 9-10×5µ.\r\n\r\nIt grows in mixed woods. I find it frequently where logs have decayed.\r\nThe specimen in Figure 46 was found in Haynes' Hollow and photographed\r\nby Dr. Kellerman. Found in October and November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma quinquepartitum. Fr._\r\n\r\nQuinquepartitum means divided into five parts. There is no apparent\r\nreason for the name. Fries could not identify Linnæus' Agaricus\r\nquinquepartitus and he attached the name of this species.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is three or four inches broad, slightly fleshy; convex,\r\nrather involute, then flattened, somewhat repand; viscid, smooth, even,\r\npale yellowish.\r\n\r\nThe gills are notched at the point of attachment to the stem, broad,\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nThe stem is three to four inches long, solid, striate or grooved,\r\nsmooth. The spores are 5-6×3-4.\r\n\r\nThis species differs from T. portentosum in the pileus not being\r\nvirgate, and from T. fucatum in the smooth, striate or grooved stem.\r\nThis plant is found in thin woods where logs have decayed. I have not\r\neaten this species but I have no doubt of its edibility. The taste is\r\npleasant. Found in October and November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma laterarium. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 47.--Tricholoma laterarium.]\r\n\r\nLaterarium is from _later_, a brick; so called because there is nearly\r\nalways a slight tinge of brick red on the disk.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to four inches broad, convex, then expanded, sometimes\r\nslightly depressed in the center; pruinose, whitish, the disk often\r\ntinged with red or brown, the thin margin marked with slight subdistant,\r\nshort, radiating ridges.\r\n\r\nThe gills are narrow, crowded, white, prolonged in little decurrent\r\nlines on the stem. The stem is nearly equal, solid, white. The spores\r\nare globose, .00018 inch in diameter. _Peck's_ 26th Rep.\r\n\r\nThis plant is quite widely distributed in the United States. It is found\r\nquite frequently in Ohio and is rather abundant on the hillsides about\r\nChillicothe, where it is frequently somewhat bulbous. The tinge of\r\nbrownish-red on the disk, and the short radiating ridges on the margin\r\nof the pileus will serve to identify the plant. It is edible and fairly\r\ngood. Found on leaf-mold in rather damp woods from July to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma panæolum. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 48.--Tricholoma panæolum.]\r\n\r\nPanæolum, all variegated. The pileus is from three to four inches broad,\r\ndeeply depressed, dusky with a gray bloom, hygrophanous; margin at first\r\ninrolled, sometimes wavy or irregular when fully expanded.\r\n\r\nThe gills are quite crowded, adnate, arcuate, white at first, turning\r\nto a light gray tinged with an intimation of red, notched with a\r\ndecurrent tooth.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, slightly bulbous, tapering upward, solid, smooth,\r\nabout the same color as the cap. The spores are subglobose, 5-6.\r\n\r\nI found the specimens in Figure 48 under pine trees, growing on a bed of\r\npine needles, on Cemetery Hill. They were found on the 9th of November.\r\n\r\nVar. calceolum, Sterb., has the pileus spongy, deformed, thin, soft,\r\nexpanded, edge incurved, sooty-gray; gills smoky; stem excentric,\r\nfusiform, very short.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma columbetta. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE DOVE-COLORED TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 49.--Tricholoma columbetta. One-third natural\r\nsize. Caps white. Stems bulbous.]\r\n\r\nColumbetta is the diminutive of _columba_, a dove; so called from the\r\ncolor of the plant. The pileus is from one to four inches broad, fleshy,\r\nconvex, then expanded; at first smooth, then silky; white, center\r\nsometimes a dilute mouse color shading to a white, frequently a tinge of\r\npink will be seen on the margin, which is at first inrolled, tomentose\r\nin young plants, sometimes cracked.\r\n\r\nThe gills are notched at the junction of the stem, crowded, thin, white,\r\nbrittle.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two inches or more long, solid, white, cylindrical, unequal,\r\noften compressed, smooth, crooked, silky especially in young plants,\r\nbulbous. Spores .00023 by .00018 inch. Flesh white, taste mild.\r\n\r\nThis is a beautiful plant, seeming to be quite free from insects, and\r\nwill remain sound for several days on your study table. I had no end of\r\ntrouble with it till Dr. Herbst suggested the species. It is quite\r\nplentiful here. Dr. Peck gives quite a number of varieties. Curtis,\r\nMcIlvaine, Stevenson, and Cooke all speak of its esculent qualities.\r\nFound in the woods in September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma melaleucum. Pers._\r\n\r\nTHE CHANGEABLE TRICHOLOMA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 50.--Tricholoma melaleucum. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nMelaleucum, black and white; from contrasted colors of the cap and\r\ngills.\r\n\r\nThis Tricholoma grows in abundance in northern Ohio. I have found it in\r\nthe woods near Bowling Green, Ohio. The specimens in the halftone were\r\nfound near Sandusky, Ohio, and were photographed by Dr. Kellerman. It is\r\nusually found in sandy soil, growing singly in shady woods.\r\n\r\nThe pileus fleshy, thin, from one to three inches broad, convex, rather\r\nbroadly umbonate, smooth, moist, with variable color, usually pale,\r\nnearly white at first, later much darker, sometimes slightly wavy.\r\n\r\nThe gills are notched, adnexed, ventricose, crowded, white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stuffed, then hollow, elastic, from two to four inches long,\r\nsomewhat smooth, whitish, sprinkled with a few fibrils, usually\r\nthickened at the base. The flesh is soft and white. There is no report,\r\nso far as I know, regarding its edibility, and I have no doubt as to\r\nthis, but would advise caution.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma lascivum. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE TARRY TRICHOLOMA.\r\n\r\nLascivum, playful, wanton; so called because of its many affinities,\r\nnone of which are very close. The pileus is fleshy, convex, then\r\nexpanded, slightly obtuse, somewhat depressed, silky at first, then\r\nsmooth, even. The gills are notched, adnexed, crowded, white; the stem\r\nis solid, equal, rigid, rooting, white, tomentose at the base. Found in\r\nthe woods, Haynes' Hollow near Chillicothe. September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma Russula. Schæff._\r\n\r\nTHE REDDISH TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 51.--Tricholoma Russula. Natural size. Caps\r\nreddish or flesh color.]\r\n\r\nRussula is so named because of its likeness in color to some species of\r\nthe genus Russula.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is three to four inches broad, fleshy, convex, then\r\ndepressed, viscid, even or dotted with granular scales, red or flesh\r\ncolor, the margin somewhat paler, involute and minutely downy in the\r\nyoung plant.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rounded or slightly decurrent, rather distant, white,\r\noften becoming red-spotted with age.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three inches long, solid, firm, whitish rosy-red,\r\nnearly equal, scaly at the apex. The spores are elliptical, 10×5µ.\r\n\r\nThis plant is quite variable in many of its peculiar characteristics,\r\nyet it usually has enough to readily distinguish it. The cap may be\r\nflesh-color and the stem rosy-red, the cap may be red and the stem white\r\nor whitish with stains of red. During wet weather the caps of all are\r\nviscid; when dry, all may be cracked more or less. The stems may not be\r\nscaly at the apex, often rosy when young. They are found in the woods\r\nsolitary, in groups, or frequently in dense clusters. The specimens in\r\nFigure 51 were found in Michigan and photographed by Dr. Fischer.\r\n\r\nI found this plant in Poke Hollow. The gills were quite decurrent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma acerbum. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE BITTER TRICHOLOMA.\r\n\r\nAcerbum means bitter to the taste.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is three to four inches broad, convex to expanded, obtuse,\r\nsmooth, more or less spotted, margin thin, at first involute, rugose,\r\nsulcate, viscid, whitish, often tinged rufous, or yellow, quite bitter\r\nto the taste.\r\n\r\nThe gills are notched, crowded, pallid or rufescent, narrow.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, rather short, blunt, yellowish, squamulose above or\r\nabout the apex. The spores are subglobose, 5-6µ.\r\n\r\nThese plants were found growing in a thick bed of moss along with\r\nArmillaria nardosmia. They were not perfect plants but I judged them to\r\nbe T. acerbum from their taste and involute margin. I sent some to Prof.\r\nAtkinson, who confirmed my classification. They grow in open woods in\r\nOctober and November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma cinerascens. Bull._\r\n\r\nCinerascens means becoming the color of ashes.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to three inches broad, fleshy, convex to expanded,\r\neven, obtuse, smooth, white, then grayish, margin thin.\r\n\r\nThe gills are emarginate, crowded, rather undulate, dingy, reddish often\r\nyellowish, easily separating from the pileus.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stuffed, equal, smooth, elastic.\r\n\r\nThey grow in clusters in mixed wood. They are mild to the taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma album. Schæff._\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 52.--Tricholoma album. Entirely white.]\r\n\r\nAlbum means white.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to four inches broad, fleshy, entirely white, convex,\r\nthen depressed, obtuse, smooth, dry, disc frequently tinged with yellow,\r\nmargin at first involute, at length repand.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rounded behind, rather crowded, thin, white, broad.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to four inches long, solid, firm, narrowed upwards,\r\nsmooth.\r\n\r\nThis plant is quite plentiful in our woods, growing usually in groups.\r\nIt grows upon the leaf mould and is frequently quite large. It is quite\r\nacrid to the taste when raw, but this is overcome in cooking. It is\r\nfound from August to October.\r\n\r\nThese plants are quite plentiful on the wooded hillsides about\r\nChillicothe. Those in Figure 52 were found on Ralston's Run and\r\nphotographed by Dr. Kellerman.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma imbricatum. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE IMBRICATED TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd_\r\n\r\nFigure 53.--Tricholoma imbricatum.]\r\n\r\nImbricatum means covered with tiles, _imbreces_, referring to the\r\nlacerated condition of the cap. This species is very closely related to\r\nT. transmutans in size, color and taste. It is, however, easily\r\nseparated by its dry cap and solid stem. Its cap is reddish-brown or\r\ncinnamon-brown, and its surface often presents a somewhat scaly\r\nappearance because the epidermis becomes lacerated or torn into small\r\nirregular fragments which adhere and seem to overlap like shingles on a\r\nroof. The flesh is firm, white, and has a farinaceous taste as well as\r\nodor. The gills are white, becoming red or rusty spotted, rather close,\r\nand notched. The stem is solid, firm, nearly equal, except slightly\r\nswollen at the base, colored much like the cap but usually paler. When\r\nold it is sometimes hollow on account of the insects mining it. The\r\nspores are white and elliptical, .00025 inch long.\r\n\r\nI found this mushroom near Salem, Ohio, Bowling Green, Ohio, and on\r\nRalston's Run near Chillicothe. Found in mixed woods from September to\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma terriferum. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH-BEARING TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nTerriferum, earth-bearing, alluding to the viscid cap's holding\r\nparticles of loam and pine needles to it as it breaks through the soil.\r\nThis is a meaty mushroom, and when properly cleaned makes an appetizing\r\ndish.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is convex, irregular, wavy on the margin and rolled inward,\r\nsmooth, viscid, pale yellow, sometimes whitish, generally covered with\r\nloam on account of the sticky surface of the cap, flesh white.\r\n\r\nThe gills are white, thin, close, slightly adnexed.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, fleshy, solid, equal, mealy, very slightly bulbous at\r\nthe base.\r\n\r\nFound near Salem, Ohio, on Hon. J. Thwing Brooks' farm September to\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma fumidellum. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE SMOKY TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nFumidellum--smoky, because of the clay-colored caps clouded with brown.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one to two inches broad, convex, then expanded,\r\nsubumbonate, bare, moist, dingy-white or clay-color clouded with brown,\r\nthe disk or umbo generally smoky brown.\r\n\r\nThe gills are crowded, subventricose, whitish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is one and a half to two and a half inches long, equal, bare,\r\nsolid whitish. The spores minute, subglobose, 4-5×4µ. _Peck_, 44 Rep.\r\n\r\nThe specimens I found grew in a mixed woods in the leaf-mold. They are\r\nfound only occasionally in our woods in September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma leucocephalum. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE-CAPPED TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nLeucocephalum is from two Greek words meaning white and head, referring\r\nto the white caps.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one and a half to two inches across, convex, then plane;\r\neven, moist, smooth when the silky veil is gone, water-soaked after a\r\nrain; flesh thin, tough, smell mealy, taste mild and pleasant.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rounded behind and almost free, crowded, white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is about two inches long, hollow, solid at the base, smooth,\r\ncartilaginous, tough, rooting. The spores are 9-10×7-8µ.\r\n\r\nIt differs from T. album in having the odor of new meal strongly marked.\r\nIt is found in open woods during September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma fumescens. Pk._\r\n\r\nSMOKY TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 54.--Tricholoma fumescens.]\r\n\r\nFumescens means growing smoky.\r\n\r\nPileus convex or expanded, dry, clothed with a very minute appressed\r\ntomentum, whitish.\r\n\r\nThe gills are narrow, crowded, rounded behind, whitish or pale cream\r\ncolor, changing to smoky blue or blackish where bruised.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, cylindrical, whitish. Spores are oblong-elliptical,\r\n5-6×5µ. Pileus is one inch broad. Stem one to one and a half inches\r\nhigh. _Peck_, 44th Rep. N. Y. State Bot.\r\n\r\nThe caps are quite a bit larger in the specimens found in Ohio than\r\nthose described by Dr. Peck. So much so that I was in doubt as to the\r\ncorrect identification. I sent some specimens to Dr. Peck for his\r\ndetermination. The species will be readily identified by the fine\r\ncrowded gills and the smoky blue or blackish hue they assume when\r\nbruised. The caps are frequently wavy, as will be seen in Figure 54.\r\n\r\nI found the plants in Poke Hollow near Chillicothe, September to\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma terreum. Schaeff._\r\n\r\nTHE GRAY TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 55.--Tricholoma terreum. Cap grayish-brown or\r\nmouse color.]\r\n\r\nTerreum is from _terra_, the earth; so called from the color. This is\r\nquite a variable species in color and size, as well as manner of growth.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one to three inches broad, dry, fleshy, thin, convex,\r\nexpanded, nearly plane, often having a central umbo; floccose-scaly,\r\nashy-brown, grayish-brown or mouse-color.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnexed, subdistant, white, becoming grayish, edges more\r\nor less eroded. Spores, 5-6µ.\r\n\r\nThe stem is whitish, fibrillose, equal, paler than the cap, varying from\r\nsolid to stuffed or hollow, one to three inches high.\r\n\r\nI find this plant on north hillsides, in beech woods. It is not\r\nplentiful. There are several varieties:\r\n\r\nVar. orirubens. Q. Edge of gills reddish.\r\n\r\nVar. atrosquamosum. Chev. Pileus gray with small black scales; g.\r\nwhitish.\r\n\r\nVar. argyraceum. Bull. Entirely pure white, or pileus grayish.\r\n\r\nVar. chrysites. Jungh. Pileus tinged yellowish or greenish.\r\n\r\nThe plants in Figure 55 were found in Poke Hollow near Chillicothe.\r\nTheir time is September to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma saponaceum. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 56.--Tricholoma saponaceum.]\r\n\r\nSaponaceum is from _sapo_, soap, so called from its peculiar odor.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to three inches broad, convex, then plane, involute at\r\nfirst as will be seen in Figure 56, smooth, moist in wet weather but not\r\nviscid, often cracked into scales or punctate, grayish or livid-brown,\r\noften with a tinge of olive, flesh firm, becoming more or less red when\r\ncut or wounded.\r\n\r\nThe gills are uncinately emarginate, thin, quite entire, not crowded,\r\nwhite, sometimes tinged with green. Spores subglobose, 5×4µ.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, unequal, rooting, smooth, sometimes reticulated with\r\nblack fibrils or scaly.\r\n\r\nThis species is found quite frequently about Chillicothe. It is quite\r\nvariable in size and color, but can be readily recognized from its\r\npeculiar odor and the flesh's becoming reddish when wounded. It is not\r\npoisonous but its odor will prevent any one from eating it. Found in\r\nmixed woods from August to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma cartilagineum. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE CARTILAGINOUS TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 57.--Tricholoma cartilagineum. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nCartilagineum means gristly or cartilaginous.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to three inches broad, cartilaginous, elastic, fleshy,\r\nconvex, soon expanded, wavy, as seen in Figure 57, margin incurved,\r\nsmooth, inclined to be blackish at first, then broken up into small\r\nblack spots.\r\n\r\nThe gills are slightly notched, adnexed, somewhat crowded, grayish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is one to two inches long, rather firm, stuffed, equal, smooth,\r\nwhite, often striate and mealy. Taste and odor pleasant.\r\n\r\nA number of my friends ate it because of its inviting taste and odor. It\r\ngrew in quantities among the clover in our city park during the wet\r\nweather of the last of May and the first of June.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma squarrulosum. Bres._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 58.--Tricholoma squarrulosum. Caps showing black\r\nsquamules.]\r\n\r\nSquarrulosum means full of scales.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to three inches broad, convex, then expanded,\r\numbonate, dry; fuscous then lurid tan, center black, with black\r\nsquamules; edge fibrillose, exceeding gills.\r\n\r\nThe gills are broad, crowded, whitish-gray, reddish when bruised.\r\n\r\nThe stem is of the same color as the pileus, punctato-squamulose. The\r\nspores are elliptical, 7-9×4-5µ.\r\n\r\nThis is a beautiful plant, growing in mixed woods among the leaves. The\r\nstem is short and apparently the same color as the pileus. The latter is\r\ncovered with black squamules which give rise to the name of the species.\r\nI have succeeded in finding the plants only in October. The specimens in\r\nFigure 58 were found in Poke Hollow, near Chillicothe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma maculatescens. Pk._\r\n\r\nSPOTTED TRICHOLOMA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 59.--Tricholoma maculatescens. One-third natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nMaculatescens means growing spotted; so called because when the specimen\r\nis dried the cap becomes more or less spotted.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one and a half to three inches broad, compact, spongy,\r\nreddish-brown, convex, then expanded, obtuse, even, slightly viscid when\r\nwet, becoming rivulose and brown spotted in drying, flesh whitish,\r\nmargin inflexed, exceeding the gills.\r\n\r\nThe gills are slightly emarginate, rather narrow, cinereous.\r\n\r\nThe stem is spongy-fleshy, equal, sometimes abruptly narrowed at the\r\nbase, solid, stout, fibrillose, pallid or whitish. The spores are oblong\r\nor subfusiform, pointed at the ends, uninucleate, .0003 inch long,\r\n.00016 broad. _Peck._\r\n\r\nI found the plant on several occasions in the month of November, but was\r\nunable to fix it satisfactorily until Prof. Morgan helped me out. The\r\nspecimens in Figure 59 were found on Thanksgiving day in the Morton\r\nwoods, in Gallia County, Ohio. I had found several specimens about\r\nChillicothe, previous to this.\r\n\r\nThis species seems to be very near T. flavobrunneum, T. graveolens, and\r\nT. Schumacheri, but may be distinguished from them by the spotting of\r\nthe pileus when drying and the peculiar shape of the spores.\r\n\r\nIt is found among the leaves in mixed woods even during freezing\r\nweather. It is no doubt edible, but I should try it cautiously for the\r\nfirst time.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma flavobrunneum. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE YELLOW-BROWN TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nFlavobrunneum is from flavus, yellow; brunneus, brown; so called from\r\nthe brown caps and yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is three to four or more inches broad, fleshy, conical, then\r\nconvex, expanded, subumbonate, viscid, brownish-bay, scaly-streaked,\r\nflesh yellow, then tinged with red.\r\n\r\nThe gills are pale yellow, emarginate, slightly decurrent, somewhat\r\ncrowded, and often tinged with red.\r\n\r\nThe stem is three to four inches long, hollow, slightly ventricose,\r\nbrownish, flesh yellow, at first viscid, sometimes reddish-brown. The\r\nspores are 6-7×4-5. Found in mixed woods among leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma Schumacheri. Fr._\r\n\r\nSchumacheri in honor of C. F. Schumacher, author of \"Plantarum\r\nSællandiæ.\" The pileus is from two to three inches broad, spongy,\r\nconvex, then plane, obtuse, even, livid gray, moist, edge beyond gills\r\nincurved.\r\n\r\nThe gills are narrow, close, pure white, slightly emarginate.\r\n\r\nThe stem is three to four inches long, solid, fibrillosely-striate,\r\nwhite and fleshy.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be a domestic plant, found in greenhouses.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma grande. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE LARGE TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nGrande, large, showy. This was quite abundant in Haines' Hollow and on\r\nRalston's Run during the wet weather of the fall of 1905. It seems to be\r\nvery like T. columbetta and is found in the same localities.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is thick, firm, hemispherical, becoming convex, often\r\nirregular, dry, scaly, somewhat silky-fibrillose toward the margin,\r\nwhite, the margin at first involute. Flesh grayish-white, taste\r\nfarinaceous.\r\n\r\nThe gills are close, rounded behind, adnexed, white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stout, solid, fibrillose, at first tapering upward, then\r\nequal or but slightly thickened at the base, pure white. The spores are\r\nelliptical, 9-11×6µ.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is four to five inches broad, the stem two to four inches\r\nlong, and an inch to an inch and a half thick. _Peck_, 44th Rep.\r\n\r\nThis is a very large and showy plant, growing among leaves after heavy\r\nrains. Both this and T. columbetta, as well as a white variety of T.\r\npersonatum, were very plentiful in the same woods. They grow in groups\r\nso closely crowded that the caps are often quite irregular. The darker\r\nand scaly disk and larger sized spore will help you to distinguish it\r\nfrom T. columbetta. The very large specimens are too coarse to be good.\r\nFound in damp woods, among leaves, from August to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma sejunctum. Sow._\r\n\r\nTHE SEPARATING TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 60.--Tricholoma sejunctum. One-half natural size.]\r\n\r\nSejunctum means having separated. It refers to the separation of the\r\ngills from the stem. Pileus fleshy, convex, then expanded, umbonate,\r\nslightly viscid, streaked with innate brown or blackish fibrils, whitish\r\nor yellow, sometimes greenish-yellow, flesh white and fragile.\r\n\r\nThe gills are broad, subdistant, rounded behind or notched, white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, stout, often irregular, white. The spores are\r\nsubglobose, .00025 inch broad. The pileus is one to three inches broad;\r\nstem one to four inches long and from four to eight lines thick.\r\n_Peck's_ Report.\r\n\r\nThis is quite common about Salem, Ohio; on the old Lake Shore line in\r\nWood County near Bowling Green, Ohio; and I have found it frequently\r\nnear Chillicothe. When cooked it has a pleasant flavor. It is always an\r\nattractive specimen. I find it under beech trees in the woods, September\r\nto November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma unifactum. Pk._\r\n\r\nUNITED TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nUnifactum means united or made into one, referring to the stems united\r\nin one base root or stem.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy but thin, convex; often irregular, sometimes\r\neccentric from its mode of growth; whitish, flesh whitish, taste mild.\r\n\r\nThe gills are thin, narrow, close, rounded behind, slightly adnexed,\r\nsometimes forked near the base, white.\r\n\r\nThe stems are equal or thicker at the base, solid, fibrous, white,\r\nunited at the base in a large fleshy mass.\r\n\r\nSpores are white, subglobose, .00016 to .0002 of an inch broad. _Peck._\r\n\r\nI found a beautiful specimen in Poke Hollow, in a beech woods with some\r\noak and chestnut. There was but one cluster growing from a large whitish\r\nfleshy mass. There were fifteen caps growing from this fleshy mass. I\r\ncould not identify species until too late to photograph.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma albellum. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE WHITISH TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to three inches broad, becoming pale-white, passing\r\ninto gray when dry, fleshy, thick at the disk, thinner at the sides,\r\nconical then convex, gibbous when expanded, when in vigor moist on the\r\nsurface, spotted as with scales, the thin margin naked, flesh soft,\r\nfloccose, white, unchangeable.\r\n\r\nThe gills are very much attenuated behind, not emarginate, becoming\r\nbroad in front; very crowded, quite entire, white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is one to two inches long, solid, fleshy-compact, ovate-bulbous\r\n(conical to the middle, cylindrical above), fibrillose-striate, white.\r\nSpores elliptical, 6-7×4µ.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma personatum. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE MASKED TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 61.--Tricholoma personatum. One-third natural\r\nsize. Caps usually tinged with lilac or violet. Stems bulbous.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 62.--Tricholoma personatum. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize. The entire plant white.]\r\n\r\nPersonatum means wearing a mask; so called because of the variety of\r\ncolors it undergoes. This is a beautiful mushroom, and is excellently\r\nflavored; it has a wide range and is frequently found, in great\r\nabundance. I have often seen it growing in almost a straight line for\r\nover twenty feet, the caps so thoroughly crowded that they had lost\r\ntheir form. When young the cap is convex and quite firm, with the margin\r\nminutely downy or adorned with mealy particles, and incurved. In the\r\nmature plant it is softer, broadly convex, or nearly plane, with the\r\nthin margin spreading and more or less turned upward and wavy. When\r\nyoung it is pale lilac in color, but with advancing age it changes to a\r\ntawny or rusty hue, especially in the center. Sometimes the cap is\r\nwhite, whitish or gray, or of a pale violaceous color.\r\n\r\nThe gills are crowded, rounded next to the stem, and nearly free but\r\napproaching close to the stem, more narrow toward the margin, with a\r\nfaint tinge of lilac or violet tint when young, but often white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, solid, adorned with very minute fibers, downy or\r\nmealy particles when young and fresh, but becoming smooth with\r\nadvancing age. The color of the stem is much like the cap but perhaps a\r\nshade lighter.\r\n\r\nThe cap is from one to five inches broad, and the stem from one to three\r\ninches high. It grows singly or in groups. It is found in thin woods and\r\nthickets. It delights to grow where an old saw mill has stood.\r\n\r\nThe finest specimens of this species that I ever saw grew on a pile of\r\ncompost of what had been green cobs from the canning factory. They had\r\nlain in the pile for about three years and late in November the compost\r\nwas literally covered with this species, many of whose caps exceeded\r\nfive inches while the color and figuration of the plants were quite\r\ntypical.\r\n\r\nIn English books this plant is spoken of as Blewits and in France as\r\nBlue-stems, but the stems in this country are inclined to be lilac or\r\nviolet, and then only in the younger plants.\r\n\r\nThe spores are nearly elliptical and dingy white, but in masses on white\r\npaper they have a salmon tint. Its smooth, almost shining, unbroken\r\nepidermis and its peculiar peach-blossom tint distinguish it from all\r\nother species of the Tricholoma. There is a white variety, very\r\nplentiful in our woods, which is illustrated in Figure 62. They are\r\nfound only in leaf-mould in the woods. September to freezing weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma nudum. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE NAKED TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nNudum, naked, bare; from the character of the margin. The pileus is two\r\nto three inches broad, fleshy, rather thin, convex, then expanded,\r\nslightly depressed; smooth, moist, the whole plant violet at first,\r\nchanging color, margin involute, thin, naked, often wavy.\r\n\r\nThe gills are narrow, rounded behind, slightly decurrent when the plant\r\nbecomes depressed, crowded, violet at first, changing to a reddish-brown\r\nwithout any tinge of violet.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three inches long, stuffed, elastic, equal, at first\r\nviolaceous, then becoming pale, more or less mealy. Spores 7×3.5µ\r\n\r\nI found some very fine specimens among the leaves in the woods in\r\nHaynes' Hollow, near Chillicothe. October and November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma gambosum. Fr._\r\n\r\nST. GEORGE'S MUSHROOM. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nGambosum, with a swelling of the hoof, _gamba_. The pileus is three to\r\nsix inches broad, sometimes even larger; very thick, convex, expanded,\r\ndepressed, commonly cracked here and there; smooth, suggesting soft kid\r\nleather; margin involute at first, pale ochre or yellowish white.\r\n\r\nThe gills are notched, with an adnexed tooth, densely crowded,\r\nventricose, moist, various lengths, yellowish white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, solid, flocculose at apex, substance creamy white;\r\nswollen slightly at the base. The spores are white.\r\n\r\nIt is called St. George's mushroom in England because it appears about\r\nthe time of St. George's day, April 23d. It frequently grows in rings or\r\ncrescents. It has a very strong odor. Its season is May and June.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tricholoma portentosum. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE STRANGE TRICHOLOMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 63.--Tricholoma portentosum.]\r\n\r\nPortentosum means strange or monstrous.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is three to five inches broad, fleshy, convex, then expanded,\r\nsubumbonate, viscid, sooty, often with purple tinge, frequently unequal\r\nand turned up, streaked with dark lines, the thin margin naked, flesh\r\nnot compact, white, fragile, and mild.\r\n\r\nThe gills are white, very broad, rounded, almost free, distant, often\r\nbecoming pale-gray or yellowish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is three to six inches long, solid, quite fibrous, sometimes\r\nequal, often tapering toward the base, white, stout, striate, villous at\r\nbase. The spores are subglobose, 4-5×4µ.\r\n\r\nThe plants grow in pine woods and along the margins of mixed woods,\r\nfrequently by roadsides. It is usually found in October and November.\r\nThe plants in Figure 63 were found near Waltham, Mass., and were sent to\r\nme by Mrs. E. B. Blackford. This is said to even excel T. personatum in\r\nedible qualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitocybe. Fr._\r\n\r\nClitocybe is from two Greek words, a hillside, or declivity, and a head;\r\nso called from the central depression of the pileus.\r\n\r\nThe genus Clitocybe differs from Tricholoma in the character of the\r\ngills. They are attached to the stem by the whole width and usually are\r\nprolonged down the stem or decurrent. This is the first genus with\r\ndecurrent gills. The genus has neither a volva nor a ring and the spores\r\nare white. The stem is elastic, spongy within, frequently hollow and\r\nextremely fibrous, continuous with the pileus.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is generally fleshy, growing thin toward the margin, plane or\r\ndepressed or funnel-shaped, and with margin incurved. The universal\r\nveil, if present at all, is seen only on the margin of the pileus like\r\nfrost or silky dew.\r\n\r\nThese plants usually grow on the ground and frequently in groups, though\r\na few may be found on decayed wood.\r\n\r\nThe Collybia, Mycena, and Omphalia have cartilaginous stems, while the\r\nstem of the Clitocybe is extremely fibrous, and the Tricholoma is\r\ndistinguished by its notched gills.\r\n\r\nThis genus, because of the variations in its species, will always be\r\npuzzling to the beginner, as it is to experts. We may easily decide it\r\nis a Clitocybe because of the gills squarely meeting the stem, or\r\ndecurrent upon it, and its external fibrous stem, but to locate the\r\nspecies is quite a different matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitocybe media. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE INTERMEDIATE CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 64.--Clitocybe media. One-half natural size.]\r\n\r\nMedia is from _medius_, middle; it is so called because it is\r\nintermediate between C. nebularis and C. clavipes. It is not as\r\nplentiful as either of the others in our woods.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is grayish-brown or blackish-brown, always darker than C.\r\nnebularis. The flesh is white and farinaceous in taste.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rather broad, not crowded, adnate and decurrent, white,\r\nwith few transverse ridges or veins in the spaces between the gills.\r\n\r\nThe stem is one to two inches long, usually tapering upward, paler\r\nthan the pileus, rather elastic, smooth. The spores are plainly\r\nelliptical, 8×5µ.\r\n\r\nThis resembles very closely the two species mentioned above and is hard\r\nto separate. I found the specimens in Figure 64 along Ralston's Run\r\nwhere the ground is mossy and damp. Found in September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitocybe infundibuliformis. Schaeff._\r\n\r\nTHE FUNNEL-FORMED CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate IX. Figure 65.--Clitocybe infundibuliformis.]\r\n\r\nInfundibuliformis means funnel-shaped. This is a beautiful plant and\r\nvery abundant in woods after a heavy rain. It grows upon the leaves and\r\nespecially among pine needles.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is at first convex and umbonate and as the plant advances in\r\nage the margin becomes elevated until the plant becomes funnel-shaped.\r\nThe margin is frequently incurved and finally wavy. The flesh is soft\r\nand white. The color of the cap is a pale tan. If the cap is examined\r\ncarefully it will be seen to be covered with a slight down or silky\r\nsubstance, especially on the margin. The color of the cap is apt to fade\r\nso that specimens will be found almost white.\r\n\r\nThe gills are thin, close, white or whitish, and very decurrent.\r\n\r\nThe stem is quite smooth, and generally tapers upward from the base. It\r\nis sometimes white or whitish, but more frequently like the cap.\r\nMycelium will usually be found at the base on the leaves, forming a soft\r\nwhite down. I have found this species in several parts of the state. It\r\nis frequently found in clusters, when the caps will be irregular on\r\naccount of the crowded condition. They are very tender and of excellent\r\nflavor. Found from August to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitocybe odora. Bull._\r\n\r\nSWEET-SMELLING CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 66.--Clitocybe odora. One-third natural size. Cap\r\npale green.]\r\n\r\nOdora means fragrant. This is one of the easiest of the Clitocybes to\r\nidentify. The collector will very readily recognize it by its\r\nolive-green color and its odor. The color in the old plant is quite\r\nvariable but in young plants is well marked. The pileus is one to two\r\nand a half inches broad, flesh quite thick; at first convex, then\r\nexpanded, plane, often depressed, sometimes inclined to be wavy; even,\r\nsmooth, olive-green.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnate, rather close, sometimes slightly decurrent, broad,\r\npallid.\r\n\r\nThe stem is one to one and a half inches long, often slightly bulbous at\r\nthe base.\r\n\r\nThese plants are found from August to October, in the woods, on leaves.\r\nThey are quite common about Chillicothe after a rain. When cooked by\r\nthemselves the flavor is a bit strong, but when mixed with other plants\r\nnot so strong in flavor, they are fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitocybe illudens. Schw._\r\n\r\nTHE DECEIVING CLITOCYBE. NOT EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate X. Figure 67.--Clitocybe illudens.\r\n\r\nCaps reddish-yellow to deep yellow. Gills yellow and decurrent.]\r\n\r\nIlludens means deceiving. Pileus of a beautiful yellow, very showy and\r\ninviting. Many a basketful has been brought to me to be identified with\r\nthe hope of their edibility. The cap is convex, umbonate, spreading,\r\ndepressed, smooth, often irregular from its crowded condition of growth;\r\nin older and larger plants the margin of the pileus is wavy. The flesh\r\nis thick at the center but thinner toward the margin. In old plants the\r\ncolor is brownish.\r\n\r\nThe gills are decurrent, some much further than others; yellow; not\r\ncrowded; broad.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, long, firm, smooth tapering towards the base, as will\r\nbe seen by Figure 67, sometimes the stems are very large.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is from four to six inches broad. The stem is six to eight\r\ninches high. It occurs in large clusters and the rich saffron color of\r\nthe entire plant compels our admiration and we are reminded that \"not\r\nall is gold that glitters.\" It will be interesting to gather a large\r\ncluster to show its phosphorescence and the heat which the plant will\r\ngenerate. You can show the phosphorescence by putting it in a dark room\r\nand by placing a thermometer in the cluster you can show the heat. It is\r\nfrequently called \"Jack-o'-lantern.\"\r\n\r\nI have known people to eat it without harm, but the chances are that it\r\nwill make most persons sick. It ought to be good, since it is so\r\nabundant and looks so rich. Found from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitocybe multiceps. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE MANY-HEADED CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 68.--Clitocybe multiceps. One-half natural size.\r\nCaps grayish-white.]\r\n\r\nMulticeps means many heads; so called because many caps are found in one\r\ncluster. It is a very common plant around Chillicothe. It has been found\r\nwithin the city limits. It is quite a typical species, too, having all\r\nthe characteristics of the genus. I have often seen over fifty caps in\r\none cluster.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is white or gray, brownish-gray or buff; smooth, thin at the\r\nmargin, convex, slightly moist in rainy weather.\r\n\r\nThe gills are white, crowded, narrow at each end, decurrent.\r\n\r\nThe stem is tough, elastic, fleshy, solid, tinged with the same color as\r\nthe cap.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one to three inches broad; grows in dense tufts. Spores\r\nare white, smooth and globose.\r\n\r\nWhen found in June the plants are a shade whiter than in the fall. The\r\nfall plants are very much the oyster color. The early plant is a more\r\ntender one and better for table use, however, I do not regard it as\r\nexcellent. They are found in woods, in old pastures by logs and stumps,\r\nand in lawns. June to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitocybe clavipes. Pers._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 69.--Clitocybe clavipes.]\r\n\r\nClavipes is from _clava_, a club, and _pes_, a foot.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one to two and a half inches broad, fleshy, rather spongy,\r\nconvex to expanded, obtuse, even, smooth, gray or brownish, sometimes\r\nwhitish toward the margin.\r\n\r\nThe gills are decurrent, descending, rather distant, nearly entire,\r\nrather broad, white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two inches long, swollen at the base, attenuated upward,\r\nstuffed, spongy, fibrillose, livid sooty. Spores are elliptical,\r\n6-7×4µ.\r\n\r\nI found specimens on Cemetery Hill underneath pine trees. I sent some to\r\nDr. Herbst and Prof. Atkinson; both pronounced them C. clavipes. They\r\nresemble quite closely C. nebularis. I have also found this plant in\r\nmixed woods. Edible and fairly good.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitocybe tornata. Fr._\r\n\r\nTornata means turned in a lathe; so called because of its neat and\r\nregular form.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is orbicular, plane, somewhat depressed, thin, smooth,\r\nshining, white, darker on the disk, very regular.\r\n\r\nThe gills are decurrent adnate, rather crowded, white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stuffed, firm, slender, smooth, pubescent at the base.\r\n\r\nThe spores are elliptical, 4-6×3-4µ.\r\n\r\nThese are small, very regular, and inodorous plants. They are found in\r\nopen fields in the grass about elm stumps. July to September. They are\r\nedible and cook readily.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitocybe metachroa. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE OBCONIC CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 70.--Clitocybe metachroa. Caps dark gray. Gills\r\npale gray.]\r\n\r\nMetachroa means changing color.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one to two and a half inches broad, somewhat fleshy,\r\nconvex, then plane, depressed, smooth, hygrophanous, brownish-gray, then\r\nlivid, growing pale.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, crowded, pale gray, slightly\r\ndecurrent.\r\n\r\nThe stem is one to two inches long, stuffed, then hollow, apex mealy,\r\nequal, gray.\r\n\r\nIt differs from C. ditopa in being inodorous and having a thicker and\r\ndepressed pileus.\r\n\r\nThe caps are quite smooth and are frequently concentrically cracked or\r\nwrinkled, much as in Clitopilus noveboracensis.\r\n\r\nIt is found growing on leaves in mixed woods, after a rain, in August\r\nand September. When young the margin is incurved but wavy in age. It is\r\nquite a hardy plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitocybe adirondackensis. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 71.--Clitocybe adirondackensis. Three-fourths\r\nnatural size. Caps white.]\r\n\r\nAdirondackensis, so called because the plant was first found in the\r\nAdirondack Mountains of New York.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is thin, submembranaceous, funnel-form, with the margin\r\ndecurved, nearly smooth, hygrophanous, white, the disk often darker.\r\n\r\nThe gills are white, very narrow, scarcely broader than the thickness of\r\nthe flesh of the pileus, crowded, long, decurrent, subarcuate, some of\r\nthem forked.\r\n\r\nThe stem is slender, subequal, not hollow, whitish, mycelio-thickened at\r\nthe base. _Peck._\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one to two inches broad and the stem is one to two and a\r\nhalf long. This is quite a pretty mushroom and has the Clitocybe\r\nappearance in a marked degree. The long, narrow, decurrent gills,\r\nsometimes tinged with yellow, some of them forked, margin of the pileus\r\nsometimes wavy, will assist in distinguishing it. I have no doubt of its\r\nedibility. Found among leaves in woods after heavy rains. With us it is\r\nconfined to the wooded hillsides. The specimens in Figure 71 were found\r\nin Michigan and photographed by Dr. Fischer. Found in July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitocybe ochropurpurea. Berk._\r\n\r\nTHE CLAY-PURPLE CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate XI. Figure 72.--Clitocybe ochropurpurea.]\r\n\r\nOchropurpurea is from _ochra_, ocher or clay color; _purpureus_, purple;\r\nit is so called because the caps are clay-color and the gills are\r\npurple. The caps are convex, fleshy, quite compact, clay-colored,\r\nsometimes tinged with purple around the margin, cuticle easily\r\nseparating, margin involute, often at first tomentose, old forms often\r\nrepand or wavy.\r\n\r\nThe gills are purple, sometimes whitish in old specimens from the white\r\nspores, broad behind, decurrent, distant.\r\n\r\nThe stem is paler than the cap, often tinted with purple, solid,\r\nfrequently long and swollen in the middle, fibrous. The spores white or\r\npale yellow.\r\n\r\nThe first time I found this species I never dreamed that it was a\r\nClitocybe. It was especially abundant on our wooded clay banks or\r\nhillsides, near Chillicothe, during the wet weather in July and August\r\nof 1905. It is a hardy plant and will keep for days. Insects do not seem\r\nto work in it readily. When cooked carefully it is rather tender and\r\nfairly good.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitocybe subditopoda. Pk._\r\n\r\nSubditopoda is so called because it is nearly (sub) like Fries' C.\r\nditopus, which means living in two places, perhaps referring to the stem\r\nbeing sometimes central and sometimes eccentric.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is thin, convex or nearly plane, umbilicate, hygrophanous,\r\ngrayish-brown, striate on the margin when moist, paler when dry, flesh\r\nconcolorous, odor and taste farinaceous.\r\n\r\nThe gills are broad, close, adnate, whitish or pale cinereous.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal, smooth, hollow, colored like the pileus. The spores\r\nare elliptical, .0002 to .00025 inch long, .00012 to .00016 broad.\r\n_Peck._\r\n\r\nIt is found on mossy ground in woods. I have found them under pine trees\r\non Cemetery Hill. Dr. Peck says he separated this species from C.\r\nditopoda because of the \"striate margin of the pileus, paler gills,\r\nlonger stem, and elliptical spores.\" The plant is edible. September and\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitocybe ditopoda. Fr._\r\n\r\nDitopoda is from two Greek words, _di-totos_, living in two places, and\r\n_pus_ or _poda_, foot, having reference to the stem being central at\r\ntimes and again eccentric.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is rather fleshy, convex, then plane, depressed, even,\r\nsmooth, hygrophanous.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnate, crowded, thin, dark, cinereous.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow, equal, almost naked.\r\n\r\nThis species resembles in appearance C. metachroa but can be separated\r\nby the mild taste and farinaceous odor. Its favorite habit is on pine\r\nneedles. August and September. I found this species in various places\r\nabout Chillicothe and on Thanksgiving day I found it in a mixed wood in\r\nGallia County, Ohio, along with Hygrophorus lauræ and Tricholoma\r\nmaculatescens. I sent some specimens to Dr. Herbst, who pronounced it C.\r\nditopoda.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitocybe pithyophila. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE PINE-LOVING CLITOCYBE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 73.--Clitocybe pithyophila. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize. Cap white and showing the pine needles upon which they grow.]\r\n\r\nPithyophila means pine-loving. This plant is very abundant under pine\r\ntrees on Cemetery Hill. They grow on the bed of pine needles. The pileus\r\nis very variable in size, white, one to two inches broad; fleshy, thin,\r\nbecoming plane, umbonate, smooth, growing pale, at length irregularly\r\nshaped, repand, wavy, sometimes slightly striate.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow, terete, then compressed, smooth, equal, even, downy\r\nat the base.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnate, somewhat decurrent, crowded, plane, always white.\r\nThe spores are 6-7×4µ. The plants in Figure 73 are small, having been\r\nfound during the cold weather in November. They are said to be good, but\r\nI have not eaten them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitocybe candicans. Fr._\r\n\r\nCandicans, whitish or shining white. Pileus is one inch broad, entirely\r\nwhite, somewhat fleshy, convex, then plane, or depressed, even, shining,\r\nwith regularly deflexed margin.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnate, crowded, thin, at length decurrent, narrow.\r\n\r\nThe stem is nearly hollow, even, waxy, shining, nearly equal,\r\ncartilaginous, smooth, incurved at the base. The spores are broadly\r\nelliptical, or subglobose, 5-6×4µ. Found in damp woods on leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitocybe obbata. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE BEAKER-SHAPED CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nObbata means shaped like an obba or beaker.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is somewhat membranaceous, umbilicate, then rather deeply\r\ndepressed, smooth, inclined to be hygrophanous, sooty-brown, margin at\r\nlength striate.\r\n\r\nThe gills are decurrent, distant, grayish-white, pruinose.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow, grayish-brown, smooth, equal, rather tough.\r\n\r\nI found plants growing on Cemetery Hill under pine trees. I had some\r\ntrouble to identify the species until Prof. Atkinson helped me out.\r\nAugust to September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitocybe gilva. Pers._\r\n\r\nTHE YELLOW CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nGilva means pale yellow or reddish yellow.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to four inches broad, fleshy, compact, soon depressed\r\nand wavy, smooth, moist, dingy ocher, flesh same color, sometimes\r\nspotted, margin involute.\r\n\r\nThe gills are decurrent, closely crowded, thin, sometimes branched,\r\nnarrow but broader in the middle, ochraceous yellow.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three inches long, solid, smooth, nearly equal,\r\nsomewhat paler than the cap, and inclined to be villous at the base.\r\n\r\nThe spores are nearly globose, 4-5µ.\r\n\r\nThis plant is sometimes found in mixed woods, but it seems to prefer\r\npine trees. It has a wide distribution, found in the east and south as\r\nwell as the west. I have found it in several localities in Ohio. Found\r\nfrom July to September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitocybe flaccida. Sow._\r\n\r\nTHE LIMP CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 74.--Clitocybe flaccida. One-half natural size.]\r\n\r\nFlaccida means flabby, limp.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to three inches broad, rather fleshy, thin, limp,\r\numbilicate, then funnel-shaped, even, smooth, sometimes cracking into\r\nminute scales, tawny or rust-colored, margin broadly reflexed.\r\n\r\nThe gills are strongly decurrent, yellowish, to whitish, close, arcuate.\r\n\r\nThe stem is tufted, unequal, rusty, somewhat wavy, tough, naked, villous\r\nat the base. The spores are globose or nearly so, 4-5×3-4µ.\r\n\r\nThis resembles the C. infundibuliformis very closely, both in its\r\nappearance and its habit. It grows among leaves in mixed woods during\r\nwet weather. It is gregarious, often many stems growing from one mass of\r\nmycelium. The plants in Figure 74 were collected in Ackerman's woods\r\nnear Columbus, Ohio, and were photographed by Dr. Kellerman. They are\r\nfound on all the hillsides about Chillicothe. Found from July to late in\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitocybe monadelpha. Morg._\r\n\r\nTHE ONE-BROTHERHOOD CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate XII. Figure 75.--Clitocybe monadelpha.]\r\n\r\nMonadelpha is from _monos_, one and _adelphos_, brother.\r\n\r\nProf. Morgan of Preston, Ohio, gives the following description of the\r\nOne-Brotherhood Clitocybe in the Mycological Flora of the Miama Valley:\r\n\"Densely cespitose. Pileus fleshy, convex, then depressed, at first\r\nglabrous, then scaly, honey-colored, varying to pallid-brown or reddish.\r\nThe stem elongated, solid, crooked, twisted, fibrous, tapering at the\r\nbase, pallid-brownish or flesh color. Spores white, a little irregular,\r\n.0055MM.\"\r\n\r\nIt might be easily taken for the ringless Armillaria mellea, but the\r\ndecidedly decurrent gills and the solid stem ought to set any one right.\r\nIn very wet weather it soon becomes water-soaked, and is then not good.\r\nIt is found in woods about stumps, and in newly cleared fields about\r\nroots or stumps. From spring to October. See Plate XII, Figure 75, for\r\nan illustration. Bresadola of Europe has determined this to be the same\r\nas that described by Scoparius in 1772 as Agaricus (Clitocybe)\r\ntabescens. I have preferred to retain the name given by Prof. Morgan.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitocybe dealbata. Sow._\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE CLYTOCYBE. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nDealbata means whitewashed; so called from its white color.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is about one inch broad, rather fleshy, convex, then plane,\r\nupturned and wavy, smooth, shining, even.\r\n\r\nThe gills are crowded, white, attached to the stem.\r\n\r\nThe stem is fibrous, thin, equal, stuffed. Spores are 4-5×2.5µ.\r\n\r\nThis is a beautiful plant and widely distributed. Found among leaves and\r\nsometimes in the grass. It makes a delicious dish.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitocybe phyllophila. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE LEAF-LOVING CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nPhyllophila means leaf and fond of. It is so called because it is found\r\non leaves in the woods during wet weather.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one and a half to three inches in diameter, whitish-tan,\r\nrather fleshy, convex, then plane, at length depressed, even, dry,\r\nnoticeably white around the margin.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, decurrent especially after the cap\r\nis depressed, somewhat distant, rather broad, white, becoming yellowish\r\nor ocher tinged, thin.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three inches long, stuffed, becoming hollow, silky,\r\nrather tough, whitish. The spores are elliptical., 6×4µ.\r\n\r\nThe whitish-tan cap with its white, silvery zone near the margin will\r\nserve to identify the species. August to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitocybe cyathiformis. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE CUP-SHAPED CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nCyathiformis is from _cyathus_, a drinking cup; _formis_, form or shape.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to three inches broad, fleshy, rather thin; at first\r\ndepressed, then funnel-shaped; even, smooth, moist, hygrophanous; the\r\nmargin involute, sooty or dark brown when moist, becoming pale when dry,\r\noften dingy ochraceous or tan-color, inclined to be wavy.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, decurrent from the depressed form of\r\nthe pileus, united behind, somewhat dingy, sparingly branched.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stuffed, elastic, tapering upward, fibrillose, base villous.\r\nThe spores are elliptical, 9×6µ.\r\n\r\nThis plant has a wide distribution and is found in woods or wood\r\nmargins. I found some very fine specimens on Ralston's Run, near\r\nChillicothe. September to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitocybe laccata. Scop._\r\n\r\nWAXY CLITOCYBE. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 76.--Clitocybe laccata. Two-thirds natural size.\r\nCaps violet or reddish-brown. Gills broad and distant.]\r\n\r\nLaccata means made of shellac or sealing-wax. This is a very common,\r\nvariable plant. Sometimes of a bright amethyst but usually of a reddish\r\nbrown. The pileus is from one to two inches broad, almost membranaceous,\r\nconvex, then plane, depressed in the center, downy with short hairs,\r\nviolet or reddish-brown.\r\n\r\nThe gills are broad, distant, attached to the stem by the entire width;\r\npale fleshy-red in hue which is more constant than the color of the cap\r\nand which forms an ear-mark to tell the species; adnate with a decurrent\r\ntooth, plane, the white spores being very abundant.\r\n\r\nThe stem is tough, fibrous, stuffed, crooked, white-villous at the base,\r\nrather long and slender, dull reddish yellow or reddish-flesh-colored,\r\nsometimes pallid or dull ochraceous, slightly striate; when the season\r\nis wet it is often watery.\r\n\r\nThis waxy Clitocybe has a wide range and is frequently very abundant. It\r\nis found through almost the entire season. It will grow almost anywhere,\r\nin woods, pastures, and lawns, and sometimes on naked ground. The plants\r\nin Figure 76 were found in tall grass in a grove in August. Those in\r\nFigure 77 were found the last of November on Cemetery Hill, under pine\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 77.--Clitocybe laccata. Two-thirds natural size.\r\nSpecimens growing late in the fall.]\r\n\r\nProf. Peck gives the following varieties:\r\n\r\nVar. amethystina--in which the cap is much darker in color.\r\n\r\nVar. pallidifolia--gills much paler than usual.\r\n\r\nVar. striatula--cap smooth, thin, so that shadowy lines are seen on cap,\r\nradiating from near the center to the margin. This grows in damp places.\r\nSome authors make Clitocybe laccata a type for a new genus and call it\r\nLacaria laccata.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Collybia. Fr._\r\n\r\nCollybia is from a Greek word meaning a small coin or a small round\r\ncake. The ring and volva are both wanting in this genus. The pileus is\r\nfleshy, generally thin, and when the plant is young the margin of the\r\npileus is incurved.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnate or nearly free, soft, membranaceous. Many species\r\nof Collybia will revive to some extent when moistened, but they are not\r\ncoriaceous.\r\n\r\nThe stem differs in substance from the pileus, cartilaginous or has a\r\ncartilaginous cuticle, while the inside is stuffed or hollow. This is\r\nquite a large genus, containing fifty-four American species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Collybia radicata. Rehl._\r\n\r\nTHE ROOTING COLLYBIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XIII. Figure 78.--Collybia radicata.]\r\n\r\nThis, in its season, is one of the most common mushrooms in the woods.\r\nIt grows in the ground, frequently around old stumps, sometimes on\r\nlawns.\r\n\r\nThose in Figure 78 were found in the woods on the ground. One plant, as\r\nwill be seen by the square, is a foot high.\r\n\r\nIt is easily recognized by its long root and flat cap. The root extends\r\ninto the ground and will frequently break before pulling up. This root\r\ngives name to the species.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, rather thin, convex, then plane, often with margin\r\nupturned in old plants as in Figure 78, and frequently wrinkled at and\r\ntoward the umbo, smooth, viscid when moist.\r\n\r\nThe color is quite variable, from almost white to gray, grayish-brown;\r\nflesh thin, very white, elastic.\r\n\r\nThe gills are usually snow white, broad, rather distant, broad in the\r\nmiddle, joined to the stem by the upper angle, unequal.\r\n\r\nThe stem is frequently long, of the same color as the cap, yet sometimes\r\npaler; smooth, firm, sometimes grooved, often twisted, tapering upward,\r\nending in a long tapering root, deeply planted in the soil.\r\n\r\nThe spores are elliptical, 15×10µ.\r\n\r\nThey grow singly, but generally have many neighbors. They are found in\r\nopen woods and around old stumps. I seldom have any trouble in getting\r\nenough for a large family and some for my neighbor, who may not know\r\nwhat to get but does know how to appreciate them. Found from June to\r\nOctober and from the New England states through the middle west. They\r\ndiffer from C. hariolarum in the densely tufted habit of the latter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Colybia ingrata. Schum._\r\n\r\nIngrata means unpleasant; from its somewhat unpleasant odor.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one to two inches broad, globose, bell-shaped, then\r\nconvex, umbonate, even, brownish-tan.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free, narrow, crowded, pallid.\r\n\r\nThe stem is twisted, subcompressed, sprinkled with a mealy tomentum\r\nabove, umber below, hollow, rather long, unequal.\r\n\r\nI found this plant quite abundant on Cemetery Hill, growing under pine\r\ntrees, from the mass of pine needles. Found in July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Collybia platyphylla. Fr._\r\n\r\nBROAD-GILLED COLLYBIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 79.--Collybia platyphylla. One-third natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nPlatyphylla is from two Greek words meaning broad and leaf, referring to\r\nthe broad gills. It is a much larger and stouter plant than Collybia\r\nradicata. It is found in new ground on open pastures about stumps, also\r\nin woods, on rotten logs and about stumps.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is three to four inches broad, at first convex, then\r\nexpanded, plane, margin often upturned, smoky brown to grayish, streaked\r\nwith dark fibrils, watery when moist, flesh white.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnexed, very broad, obliquely notched behind, distant,\r\nsoft, white, in age more or less broken or cracked.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, thick, often striated, whitish, soft, stuffed,\r\nsometimes slightly powdered at the apex, root blunt. The spores are\r\nwhite and elliptical.\r\n\r\nIt is easily distinguished from C. radicata by the blunt base of the\r\nroot and the very broad gills. Like C. radicata they need to be cooked\r\nwell or there is a slightly bitter taste to them. They are found from\r\nJune to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Collybia dryophila. Bull._\r\n\r\nOAK-LOVING COLLYBIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 80.--Collybia dryophila. Natural size. Caps bay-brown.]\r\n\r\nDryophila is from two Greek words, oak and fond of. The pileus is\r\nbay-brown, bay red, or tan color, one or two inches broad, convex,\r\nplane, sometimes depressed and the margin elevated, flesh thin and\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free with a decurrent tooth, crowded, narrow, white, or\r\nwhitish, rarely yellow.\r\n\r\nThe stem is cartilaginous, smooth, hollow, yellow, or yellowish, equal,\r\nsometimes thickened at the base as will be seen in Figure 80. The color\r\nof the stem is usually the same as the cap. This is a very common\r\nplant about Chillicothe. They are found in woods, especially under oak\r\ntrees, but are also found in open places. I found them on the High\r\nSchool lawn in Chillicothe. Some very fine specimens that were found\r\ngrowing in a well marked ring, in an old orchard, were brought to me\r\nabout the first of May. Their season is from the first of May to\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Collybia zonata. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE ZONED COLLYBIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate XIV. Figure 81.--Collybia Zonata.]\r\n\r\nZonata, zoned; referring to the concentric zones on the cap which show\r\nfaintly in Figure 81.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is about one inch broad, sometimes more, sometimes less;\r\nrather fleshy, thin, convex, when expanded nearly plane, slightly\r\numbilicate, covered with fibrous down; tawny or ochraceous tawny,\r\nsometimes marked with faintly darker zones; even in the very young\r\nspecimens the umbilicate condition is usually present.\r\n\r\nThe gills are narrow, close, free, white or nearly white, usually with a\r\npulverulent edge.\r\n\r\nThe stem is one to three inches long, rather firm, equal, hollow,\r\ncovered like the cap with a fibrous down, tawny, or brownish tawny. The\r\nspores are broadly elliptical, .0002 inch long, .00016 broad.\r\n\r\nThis species closely resembles C. stipitaria, but is easily\r\ndistinguished from it because of its habits of growth, different gills,\r\nand shorter spores. It is found on or near decaying wood in mixed woods.\r\nI have found it frequently on Ralston's Run but always only a few\r\nspecimens in one place. It does not grow in a cespitose manner with us.\r\nFound in August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Collybia maculata. Alb. & Schw._\r\n\r\nTHE SPOTTED COLLYBIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 82.--Collybia maculata. Two-thirds natural size.\r\nReddish-brown spots on caps and stems.]\r\n\r\nMaculata, spotted; referring to the reddish spots or stains both on the\r\ncap and on the stem. The pileus is two to three inches broad, at first\r\nwhite, then spotted (as well as the stem) with reddish brown spots or\r\nstains, fleshy, very firm, convex, sometimes nearly plane, even, smooth,\r\ntruly carnose, compact, at first hemispherical and with an involute\r\nmargin, often repand.\r\n\r\nThe gills are somewhat crowded, narrow, adnexed, often free, linear,\r\nwhite or whitish, often brownish cream, gills not reaching to the margin\r\nof the cap.\r\n\r\nThe stem is three to four inches long, nearly solid, more or less\r\ngrooved, stout, unequal, sometimes ventricose, frequently partially\r\nbulbous, lighter than the gills, usually spotted in age, white at first.\r\nThe spores are subglobose, 4-6µ. The plant is a hardy one. It will keep\r\nfor several days. The plants in Figure 82 grew in the woods where a log\r\nhad rotted down.\r\n\r\nVar. immaculata, Cooke, differs from the typical form in not changing\r\ncolor or being spotted, and in the broader and serrated gills. This\r\nvariety delights in fir woods. September to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Collybia atrata. Fr._\r\n\r\nCHARCOAL COLLYBIA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 83.--Collybia atrata. One-half natural size. Caps\r\ndull blackish-brown. Gills grayish-white.]\r\n\r\nAtrata, clothed in black; from the pileus being very black when young.\r\nThe pileus is from one to two inches broad, at first regular and convex,\r\nwhen expanded becoming, as a rule, irregular in shape, sometimes\r\npartially lobed or wavy; in young plants the cap is a dull blackish\r\nbrown, faded in older specimens to a lighter brown, umbilicate, smooth,\r\nshining.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnate, slightly crowded, with many short ones, rather\r\nbroad, grayish-white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is smooth, equal, even, hollow, or stuffed, tough, short, brown\r\nwithin and without, but lighter than the cap. The plant grows in\r\npastures where stumps have been burned out, always, so far as I have\r\nnoticed, on burned ground. Spores .00023×.00016.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Collybia ambusta. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE SCORCHED COLLYBIA.\r\n\r\nAmbusta, burned or scorched, from its being found on burned soil.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is nearly membranaceous, convex, then expanded, nearly plane,\r\npapillate, striatulate, smooth, livid brown, hygrophanous, umbonate.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnate, crowded, lanceolate, white, then of a smoky tinge.\r\n\r\nThe stem is somewhat stuffed, tough, short, livid. Spores 5-6×3-4.\r\n\r\nThis species differs from C. atrata in having an umbonate pileus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Collybia confluens. Pers._\r\n\r\nTHE TUFTED COLLYBIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 84.--Collybia confluens. Natural size, showing\r\nreddish stems.]\r\n\r\nConfluens means growing together; so called from the stems often being\r\nconfluent or adhering to each other.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is from an inch to an inch and a quarter broad,\r\nreddish-brown, often densely cespitose, somewhat fleshy, convex, then\r\nplane, flaccid, smooth, often watery, margin thin, in old specimens\r\nslightly depressed and wavy.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free and in old plants remote from the stem, rather\r\ncrowded, narrow, flesh colored, then whitish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three inches long, hollow, pale red, sprinkled with a\r\nmealy pubescence. The spores are slightly ovate, inclined to be pointed\r\nat one end, 5-6×3-4µ.\r\n\r\nThese plants grow among leaves in the woods after warm rains, growing in\r\ntufts, sometimes in rows or lines. They are not as large as C.\r\ndryophylla, the stem is quite different and the plants seem to have the\r\nability to revive like a Marasmius. They can be dried for winter use.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Collybia myriadophylla. Pk._\r\n\r\nMANY-LEAVED COLLYBIA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 85.--Collybia myriadophylla.]\r\n\r\nMyriadophylla is from two Greek words, meaning many leaves. It has\r\nreference to its numerous gills.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is very thin, broadly convex, then plane or centrally\r\ndepressed, sometimes umbillicate, hygrophanous, brown when moist,\r\nochraceous or tan-color when dry.\r\n\r\nThe gills are very numerous, narrow, linear, crowded, rounded behind or\r\nslightly adnexed, brownish-lilac.\r\n\r\nThe stem is slender, but commonly short, equal, glabrous, stuffed or\r\nhollow, reddish-brown. The spores are minute, broadly elliptical, .00012\r\nto .00016-inch long, .0008-inch broad. _Peck_, 49th Rep.\r\n\r\nI found only a few specimens in Haynes's Hollow. The caps were about an\r\ninch broad and the stems were an inch and a half long. It will be easily\r\nidentified if one has the description of it, because of its peculiarly\r\ncolored gills. I found my plants on a decayed stump in August. In the\r\ndried specimens the gills assume a more brownish-red hue, as in the next\r\nfollowing species.\r\n\r\nCollybia colorea. Pk. They sometimes appear to have a glaucous\r\nreflection, probably from the abundance of the spores. The stem is more\r\nor less radicated and often slightly floccose-pruinose toward the base.\r\nThe basidia are very short, being only .0006 to .0008-inch long.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Collybia atratoides. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE BLACKISH COLLYBIA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 86.--Collybia atratoides. Two-thirds natural size.\r\nCaps blackish to grayish-brown.]\r\n\r\nAtratoides means like the species _atrata_, which means black; so called\r\nbecause the caps when fresh are quite black. Atratoides has a different\r\nhabitat and is not so dark.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is thin, convex, subumbilicate, glabrous, hygrophanous,\r\nblackish-brown when moist, grayish-brown and shining when dry.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rather broad, subdistant, adnate, grayish-white, often\r\ntransversely veiny above and venosely connected.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal, hollow, smooth, grayish-brown with a whitish\r\nmycelioid tomentum at the base. The spores are nearly globose, about\r\n.0002-inch broad. The pileus is six to ten lines broad and the stem is\r\nabout one inch long. _Peck._\r\n\r\nThe plant is gregarious, growing on decayed wood and on mossy sticks in\r\nmixed woods. The margin of the cap is often serrated, as you will see in\r\nFigure 86, yet this does not seem to be a constant characteristic of the\r\nspecies. It is closely related to C. atrata, but its habitat and the\r\ncolor of its pileus and gills differ very greatly. I have not eaten it,\r\nbut have no doubt of its good qualities.\r\n\r\nFound in August and September. Quite common in all our woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Collybia acervata. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE TUFTED COLLYBIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 87.--Collybia acervata. Two-thirds natural size.\r\nCaps pale, tan or dingy pink.]\r\n\r\nAcervata, from acervus, a mass, a heap.\r\n\r\nPileus fleshy but thin, convex, or nearly plane, obtuse, glabrous,\r\nhygrophanous, pale, tan-color or dingy pinkish-red, and commonly striate\r\non the margin when moist, paler or whitish when dry.\r\n\r\nGills narrow, close, adnexed or free, whitish or tinged with\r\nflesh-color.\r\n\r\nThe stem slender, rigid, hollow, glabrous, reddish, reddish-brown or\r\nbrown, often whitish at the top, especially when young, commonly with a\r\nmatted down at the base. Spores elliptical, 6×3-4µ.\r\n\r\nThe plant is cespitose. Pileus one-half inch broad. Stem two to three\r\ninches long. _Peck's_ 49th Report.\r\n\r\nThis is a beautiful plant when growing in large tufts. The entire plant\r\nis tender and has a delicate flavor. I found the plant figured here on\r\nthe Frankfort pike where an old saw mill had formerly stood. It grew\r\nabundantly there, along with Lepiota Americana and Pluteus cervinus.\r\n\r\nFound from August to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Collybia velutipes. Curtis._\r\n\r\nTHE VELVET-FOOT COLLYBIA.

Figure 88.--Collybia velutipes.\r\n\r\nNatural size, showing the velvet stems, which give name to the\r\nspecies.]\r\n\r\nVelutipes, from _vellum_, velvet and _pes_, foot.\r\n\r\nPileus from one to four inches broad, tawny yellow, fleshy at the\r\ncenter, thick on the margin, quite sticky or viscid when moist, margin\r\nslightly striate, sometimes inclined to be excentric.\r\n\r\nGills rounded behind, broad, slightly adnexed, tan or pale-yellow,\r\nsomewhat distant.\r\n\r\nThe stem is cartilaginous, tough, hollow, umber, then becoming blackish,\r\nwith a velvety coat. Spores are elliptical, 7×3-3.5µ.\r\n\r\nIt grows on stumps, logs and roots, in the ground. It grows almost the\r\nyear round. I have gathered it to eat in February. Plate XV gives a very\r\ncorrect notion of the plant. It is most plentiful in September, October\r\nand November, yet found throughout the winter months.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mycena. Fr._\r\n\r\nMycena is from a Greek word, meaning a fungus. The plants of this genus\r\nare small and rather fragile.\r\n\r\nPileus more or less membranaceous, generally striate, with the margin\r\nalmost straight, and at first pressed to the stem, never involute,\r\nexpanded, campanulate, and generally umbonate.\r\n\r\nThe stem is externally cartilaginous, hollow, not stuffed when young,\r\nconfluent with the cap. Gills never decurrent, though some species have\r\na broad sinus near the stem.\r\n\r\nMost species are small and inodorous, but some which have a strong\r\nalkaline odor are probably not good. Some are known to be edible.\r\n\r\nA few species exude a colored or watery juice when bruised. The Mycena\r\nresembles the Collybia, but never has the incurved margin of the latter.\r\nThe plants are usually smaller, and the caps are more or less conical.\r\n\r\nThis genus might be mistaken for Omphalia, in which the gills are but\r\nslightly decurrent, but in Omphalia the cap is umbilicate while in\r\nMycena it is umbonate.\r\n\r\nTheir being so small makes the determination of species somewhat\r\ndifficult. Some have characteristic odors which greatly assist in\r\nestablishing their identity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mycena galericulata. Scop._\r\n\r\nTHE SMALL PEAKED-CAP MYCENA.

It is very common and\r\nsometimes found in abundance. The plants are frequently densely\r\nclustered, the numerous stems matted together by a soft hairy down at\r\nthe base. There are many forms of this plant. Found from September to\r\nfrost. The plants in Figure 89 were photographed by Prof. G. D. Smith,\r\nAkron, O.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mycena rugosa.

I have found it in dense tufts or clusters, sometimes on\r\nlawns, on the bare ground, and in the woods. It is one of the plants in\r\nwhich the stems may be cooked with the caps.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mycena capillaris. Schum._\r\n\r\nCapillaris means hair-like. This is a very small but beautiful white\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is bell-shaped, at length umbilicate, smooth.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, ascending, rather distant.\r\n\r\nThe stem is thread-like, smooth, short.\r\n\r\nThe spores are 7-8×4. _Fries._\r\n\r\nThese plants are very small and easily overlooked. They grow on leaves\r\nin the woods after a rain. July and August. Quite common.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mycena setosa.

Brownish-red or flesh-color.\r\nA dull red juice exudes from the stem. Margin dentate by sterile flap.]\r\n\r\nHæmatopa is from two Greek words, meaning blood and foot.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, one inch broad, conic, or bell-shaped, somewhat\r\numbonate, obtuse, whitish to flesh-color, with more or less dull red,\r\neven, or slightly striate at the margin, the margin extending beyond the\r\ngills and is toothed.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, often with a decurrent tooth,\r\nwhitish. Spores, 10×6-7.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to four inches long, firm, hollow, sometimes smooth,\r\nsometimes powdered with whitish, soft hairy down, in color the same as\r\nthe pileus, yielding a dark red juice which gives name to the species.\r\n\r\nThe color varies quite a little in these plants, owing to some having\r\nmore of the red juice than others. The genus is readily identified by\r\nthe dull blood-red juice, hollow stem, the crenate margin of the cap,\r\nand its dense cespitose habits. It is found on decayed logs in damp\r\nplaces from August to October. The plants in Figure 90 were found in\r\nHaynes' Hollow, September 8. The plant is widely distributed over the\r\nUnited States. No one will have the slightest difficulty in recognizing\r\nthis species after seeing the plants in the figure above.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mycena alkalina. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE STUMP MYCENA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 91.--Mycena alkalina. Two-thirds natural size,\r\noften larger. Young specimens.]\r\n\r\nSolitary or cespitose; pileus one-half to two inches broad, rather\r\nmembranaceous, campanulate, obtuse, naked, deeply striate, moist,\r\nshining when dry, when old expanded or depressed, but little changed in\r\ncolor, though occasionally with a pink or yellow hue, whitish or\r\ngrayish, the center of the disk darker.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnate, rather distant, slightly ventricose, at first\r\npale, then glaucous, pinkish, or yellow, more or less connected by\r\nveins.\r\n\r\nThe stem is smooth, slightly sticky, shining, villous at the base with a\r\nsometimes tawny-down, sometimes firm and tenacious, hollow, attenuated\r\nupward. The plant is rigid, but brittle, and strong-scented. Found on\r\ndecayed stumps and logs, you will meet it frequently. August to\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mycena filopes. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHREADY-STEMMED MYCENA.\r\n\r\nPileus membranaceous, obtuse, campanulate, then expanded, striate, brown\r\nor umber, tinged with pink.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free or minutely adnexed, slightly ventricose, white or\r\npaler than the pileus, crowded.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow, juicy, smooth, filiform, rather brittle, whitish or\r\nbrownish. Found in woods on leaves, after a rain, from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mycena stannea. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE TIN-COLORED MYCENA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 92.--Mycena stannea. Natural size. Caps white,\r\nsometimes smoky.]\r\n\r\nStannea pertaining to the color of tin. This is a delicate species that\r\ngrows in the woods in tufts on rotten wood in damp places. The general\r\ncharacter is shown in the illustration, being nearly white but many of\r\nthe pilei are somewhat smoky.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is firm, membranaceous, bell-shaped, then expanded, smooth,\r\nvery slightly striate, hygrophanous, quite silky, tin-color.\r\n\r\nThe gills are firmly attached to the stem, with a decurrent tooth,\r\nconnected by veins, grayish-white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is smooth, even, shining, becoming pale, at length compressed.\r\nThis species differs from Mycena vitrea in having a tooth to the gills.\r\nMay, June, and July.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mycena vitrea. Fr._\r\n\r\nVitrea, glassy. This plant is quite fragile. The pileus is\r\nmembranaceous, bell-shaped, livid-brown, finely striate, no trace of\r\numbo.\r\n\r\nThe gills are firmly attached to the stem, not connected by veins,\r\ndistinct, linear, whitish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is slender, slightly striate, polished, pale, base fibrillose.\r\nThis species differs from M. ætites and M. stannea in gills not having a\r\ndecurrent tooth and not being connected by veins.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mycena corticola. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 93.--Mycena corticola.]\r\n\r\nCorticola means dwelling on bark.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the smallest of the Mycenas, the pileus being about two to\r\nfour lines across, thin, hemispherical, obtuse, becoming slightly\r\numbilicate, deeply striate, glabrous or flocculosely pruinose, gray,\r\ntan, or brownish.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, with slight decurrent tooth, broad,\r\nrather ovate, pallid.\r\n\r\nThe stem, is short, slender, incurved, glabrous or minutely scurfy,\r\nsomewhat paler than the pileus. The spores are elliptical, 5-6×3µ;\r\ncystidia obtusely fusiform, 50-60×8-10µ.\r\n\r\nThese plants are found on the bark of living trees. After rains I have\r\nseen the bark on the shade trees along the walks in Chillicothe,\r\nliterally covered with these beautiful little plants. The plants in\r\nFigure 93 were taken from a maple tree the 4th of December. They are\r\nvery close allied to M. hiemalis but can be distinguished by the broad,\r\novate gills bearing cystidia, and smaller spores.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mycena hiemalis. Osbeck._\r\n\r\nTHE WINTER MYCENA.\r\n\r\nHiemalis, of, or belonging to, winter. The pileus quite thin,\r\nbell-shaped, very slightly umbonate, margin striate; pinkish, rufescent,\r\nwhite, sometimes pruinose.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnate, linear, white or whitish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is slender, curved, base downy, whitish, pinkish-red. The\r\nspores are 7-8×3.\r\n\r\nThis is a more delicate species than M. corticola and differs from it in\r\nits narrow gills, and striate, not sulcate, pileus, also in the color of\r\nthe stem. Found on stumps and logs. October and November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mycena Leaiana. Berk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 94.--Mycena leaiana. Natural size. Caps bright\r\norange and very viscid.]\r\n\r\nLeaiana named in honor of Mr. Thomas G. Lea, who was the first man to\r\nstudy mycology in the Miami Valley. This is a very beautiful plant\r\ngrowing on decayed beech logs in rainy weather. The pileus is fleshy,\r\nvery viscid, bright orange, the margin slightly striate as will be seen\r\nin the one whose cap shows.\r\n\r\nThe gills are distant, not entire, broad, notched at the stem, attached,\r\nthe edge a dusky orange, or vermilion, the short gills beginning at the\r\nmargin.\r\n\r\nThe stem is in most cases curved, attenuated toward the cap, smooth,\r\nhollow, rather firm, quite hirsute or strigose at the base. The spores\r\nare elliptical, apiculate, .0090×.0056 mm.\r\n\r\nThey are cæspitose, growing in dense tufts on logs somewhat decayed. It\r\nis extremely viscid, so much so that your hands will be stained yellow\r\nif you handle it much. It grows from spring to fall but is usually more\r\nabundant in August and September. Very common.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mycena iris. B._\r\n\r\nPileus is small, convex, expanded, obtuse, slightly viscid, striate,\r\nquite [blue?] when young, growing brownish with blue fibrils.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free, tinged with gray.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, bluish below, tinged with brown above, somewhat\r\npruinose. Found in damp woods after a rain, in August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mycena pura. Pers._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by Prof. G. D. Smith._\r\n\r\nFigure 95.--Mycena pura.]\r\n\r\nPura means unstained, pure.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, thin, bell-shaped, expanded, obtusely umbonate,\r\nfinely striate on the margin, sometimes having margin upturned, violet\r\nto rose.\r\n\r\nThe gills are broad, adnate to sinuate, in older plants sometimes free\r\nby breaking away from the stem, connected by veins, sometimes wavy and\r\ncrenate on the edge, the edge of the gills sometimes almost or quite\r\nwhite, violet, rose.\r\n\r\nThe stem is even, nearly naked, somewhat villous at the base, sometimes\r\nalmost white when young, later assuming the color of the cap, hollow,\r\nsmooth.\r\n\r\nThe spores are white and oblong, 6-8×3-3.5. M. Pelianthina differs\r\nfrom this in having dark-edged gills. It differs from M. pseudopura and\r\nM. zephira in having a strong smell. M. ianthina differs in having a\r\nconical cap.\r\n\r\nThis plant is quite widely distributed. Our plants are light-violet in\r\ncolor, and the color seems constant. I have found it in mixed woods. It\r\nis found in September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mycena vulgaris. Pers._\r\n\r\nVulgaris means common.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is small, convex, then depressed, papillate, viscid,\r\nbrownish-gray, finely striate on the margin.\r\n\r\nThe gills are subdecurrent, thin, white; the depressed cap and decurrent\r\ngills make the plant resemble an Omphalia. Spores, 5×2.5µ.\r\n\r\nThe stem is viscid, pale, tough, fibrillose at the base, rooting,\r\nbecoming hollow. It differs from M. pelliculosa in not having a\r\nseparable cuticule and the fold-like gills.\r\n\r\nThis plant will be recognized by its smoky or grayish color, umbilicate\r\npileus, and viscid stem. It is found in woods on leaves and decayed\r\nsticks. August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mycena epipterygia. Scop._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 96.--Mycena epipterygia.]\r\n\r\nEpipterygia is _Epi_, upon, and _Pterygion_, a small wing.\r\n\r\nThese are small, the pileus being one-half to one inch broad,\r\nmembranaceous, bell-shaped, then expanded, rather obtuse, not depressed,\r\nstriate, the cuticule separable in every condition and viscid in damp\r\nweather, gray, often pale yellowish-green near the margin often minutely\r\nnotched when young.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem with a decurrent tooth, thin, whitish\r\nor tinged with gray.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to four inches long, hollow, tough, rooting, viscid,\r\nyellowish, sometimes gray or even whitish. The spores are elliptical,\r\n8-10×4-5µ.\r\n\r\nThese plants have a wide distribution and [are?] found on branches,\r\namong moss and dead leaves. They are found in clusters and solitary.\r\nThey resemble in many ways M. alcalina but do not have the peculiar\r\nsmell.\r\n\r\nThe plants in Figure 96 were photographed by Prof. G. D. Smith of Akron.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Omphalia. Fr._\r\n\r\nOmphalia is from a Greek word meaning the navel; referring here to the\r\ncentral depression in the cap.\r\n\r\nThe pileus from the first is centrally depressed, then funnel-shaped,\r\nalmost membranaceous, and watery when moist; margin incurved or\r\nstraight. Stem cartilaginous and hollow, often stuffed when young,\r\ncontinuous with the cap but different in character. Gills decurrent and\r\nsometimes branched.\r\n\r\nThey are generally found on wood, preferring a damp woody situation and\r\na wet season. It is easily distinguished from Collybia and Mycena by its\r\ndecurrent gills. In some of the species of the Mycena where the gills\r\nare slightly decurrent, the pileus is not centrally depressed as it is\r\nin corresponding species of Omphalia. There are a few species of\r\nOmphalia whose pileus is not centrally depressed but whose gills are\r\nplainly decurrent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Omphalia campanella. Batsch._\r\n\r\nTHE BELL OMPHALIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate XVII. Figure 97.--Omphalia campanella.]\r\n\r\nCampanella means a little bell.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is membranaceous, convex to extended, centrally depressed,\r\nstriate, watery, rusty-yellow in color.\r\n\r\nThe gills are moderately close, decurrent, bow-shaped, connected by\r\nveins, rigid, firm, yellowish. The spores elliptical, 6-7×3-4µ.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow, clothed with down, and paler above.\r\n\r\nThis plant is very common and plentiful in our woods and is widely\r\ndistributed in the states. It grows on wood or on ground very heavily\r\ncharged with decaying wood. It is found through the summer and fall. It\r\nis delicious if you have the patience to gather them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Omphalia epichysia. Pers._\r\n\r\nThe pileus is thin, convex to expanded, depressed in the center,\r\nsooty-gray with a watery appearance, pallid to nearly white when dry.\r\n\r\nThe gills are slightly decurrent, whitish then gray, somewhat crowded.\r\n\r\nThe stem is slender, hollow, gray. The spores are elliptical,\r\n8-10×4-5µ.\r\n\r\nIt grows in decayed wood. Its smoky color, funnel-shaped pileus, and\r\ngray short stem will distinguish it. I have some plants sent me from\r\nMassachusetts which seem to be much smaller than our plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Omphalia umbellifera. Linn._\r\n\r\nTHE UMBEL OMPHALIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nUmbellifera--_umbella_, a small shade; _ferro_, to bear. Pileus one-half\r\ninch broad, membranaceous, whitish, convex, then plane, broadly obconic,\r\nslightly umbilicate even in the smallest plants, hygrophanous in wet\r\nweather, rayed with darker striæ.\r\n\r\nThe gills are decurrent, very distant, quite broad behind, triangular,\r\nwith straight edges.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, not more than one inch long, dilated at the apex, of\r\nsame color as the pileus, at first stuffed, then hollow, firm, white,\r\nvillous at the base.\r\n\r\nIt is a common plant in our woods, growing on decayed wood or ground\r\nlargely made up of rotten wood. Decayed beech bark is a favorite\r\nhabitat. Found from July till October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Omphalia cæspitosa. Bol._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 98.--Omphalia cæspitosa. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nCæspitosa means growing in tufts; _cæspes_, turf. The pileus is\r\nsubmembranaceous, very small, convex, nearly hemispherical, umbilicate,\r\nthin, sulcate, light-ochre, margin crenate, smooth.\r\n\r\nThe gills are distant, rather broad, shortly decurrent, whitish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is curved, hollow, colored like the pileus, slightly bulbous at\r\nthe base. The spores are 6×5.\r\n\r\nThis species is very much like Omphalia oniscus and they can only be\r\ndistinguished by their habitats and color. It is found in August and\r\nSeptember. It delights in well rotted wood. I have seen millions in one\r\nplace.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Omphalia oniscus. Fr._\r\n\r\nBOLTON'S OMPHALIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nOniscus, a name given to a species of codfish by the Greeks, so named\r\nbecause of their gray color. The pileus is flaccid, irregular, about one\r\ninch broad, convex, plane, or depressed, slightly fleshy, wavy,\r\nsometimes lobed, margin striate, dark cinereous, paler when dry.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnate, decurrent, livid or whitish, arranged in groups of\r\nfour, somewhat distant.\r\n\r\nThe stem is about one inch long, rather firm, straight or curved,\r\nsometimes unequal, nearly hollow. The spores are 12×7-8µ.\r\n\r\nThis is found in damp places from August to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Omphalia pyxidata. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE BOX OMPHALIA.\r\n\r\nPyxidata means made like a box, from _pyxis_, a box.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is somewhat membranaceous, clearly umbilicate, then\r\nfunnel-shaped, smooth when moist, margin often striate, brick-red.\r\n\r\nThe gills are decurrent, rather distant, triangular, narrow, reddish\r\ngray, often yellowish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stuffed, then hollow, even, tough, pale-tawny. The spores\r\nare 7-8×5-6µ.\r\n\r\nThe plants are usually hygrophanous, but when dry, floccose or slightly\r\nsilky. This is a small plant growing usually on lawns, nearly hidden in\r\nthe grass. I found some very fine specimens on Dr. Sulzbacher's lawn on\r\nSecond Street, Chillicothe. The plant is, however, widely distributed. I\r\nfound many specimens on the 3d of November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Omphalia fibula. Bull._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 99.--Omphalia fibula.]\r\n\r\nFibula means a buckle or pin, from the pin-like stem.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is membranaceous, at first top-shaped, expanded, slightly\r\numbilicate, striate, margin inclined to be inflexed, yellow or tawny,\r\nwith a dusky center, minutely pilose.\r\n\r\nThe gills are deeply decurrent, paler, distinct.\r\n\r\nThe stem is slender, nearly orange color with a violet-brown apex, the\r\nwhole minutely pilose. The spores are elliptical, 4-5×2µ.\r\n\r\nThey are found on mossy banks where it is more or less damp. I have only\r\nfound it in October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Omphalia alboflava. Moy._\r\n\r\nTHE GOLDEN-GILLED OMPHALIA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 100.--Omphalia alboflava. Cap yellowish-brown,\r\nsometimes a greenish tinge. Gills golden yellow.]\r\n\r\nAlboflava is from two Greek words meaning whitish-yellow, from the\r\nyellow gills.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one to two inches broad, thin, somewhat membranaceous,\r\numbilicate, flaccid, covered with fine woolly material, yellow-brown,\r\nlighter when dry, margin reflexed.\r\n\r\nThe gills are distant, deep golden-yellow, occasionally forked.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow, equal, smooth, shining, egg-yellow.\r\n\r\nThe spores are elliptical, 8×4µ.\r\n\r\nThis plant, is found quite frequently on decayed branches and logs about\r\nChillicothe. I have never had the opportunity to test its edibility but\r\nI have no doubt of its being good.\r\n\r\nThe plants in Figure 100 were found in Haynes' Hollow and were\r\nphotographed by Dr. Kellerman. Found from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marasmius. Fr._\r\n\r\n_Marasmius is a Greek participle meaning withered or shriveled_; it is\r\nso called because the plant will wither and dry up, but revive with the\r\ncoming of rain.\r\n\r\nThe spores are white and subelliptical. The pileus is tough and fleshy\r\nor membranaceous.\r\n\r\nThe stem is cartilaginous and continuous with the pileus, but of a\r\ndifferent texture. The gills are thick, rather tough and distant,\r\nsometimes unequal, variously attached or free, rarely decurrent, with a\r\nsharp entire edge. It is quite a large genus and many of its species\r\nwill be of great interest to the student.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marasmius oreades. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE FAIRY-RING MUSHROOM. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 101.--Marasmius oreades. Two-thirds natural size.]\r\n\r\n_Oreades, mountain nymphs._ Pileus is fleshy, tough and pliable when\r\nmoist, brittle when dry, convex, becoming flat, somewhat umbonate,\r\nbrownish-buff at first, becoming cream-color; when old it is usually\r\nquite wrinkled.\r\n\r\nThe gills are broad and wide apart, creamy or yellowish, rounded at the\r\nstem end, unequal in length.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, equal, tough, fibrous, naked and smooth at base,\r\neverywhere with a downy surface. The spores are white, 8×5.\r\n\r\nTo my mind there is no more appetizing mushroom than the \"Fairy Ring\"\r\nmushroom. Figure 101 will give an accurate notion of the plant and\r\nFigure 102 will show how they grow in the grass. It is found in all\r\nparts of Ohio. Every old pasture field or lawn will be full of these\r\nrings. The plant is small but its plentifulness will make up for its\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nThere are many conjectures why this and many other mushrooms grow in a\r\ncircle. The explanation is quite obvious. The ring is started by a clump\r\nor an individual mushroom. The ground where the mushroom grew is\r\nrendered unfit for mushrooms again, the spores fall upon the ground and\r\nthe mycelium spreads out from this point, consequently each year the\r\nring is growing larger. Sometimes they appear only in a crescent form.\r\nOne can tell, by looking over a lawn or pasture, where the rings are,\r\nbecause, from the decay of the mushroom, the grass is greener and more\r\nvigorous there.\r\n\r\nLong ago, in England and Ireland, before the peasantry had begun to\r\nquestion the reality of the existence of the fairy folk and their\r\nbeneficent interference in the affairs of life, these emerald-hued rings\r\nwere firmly believed to be due to the fairy footsteps which nightly\r\npressed their chosen haunts, and to mark the \"little people's\" favorite\r\ndancing ground. \"They had always fine music among themselves, and danced\r\nin a moonshiny night around or in a ring, as one may see to this day\r\nupon every common in England where mushrooms grow,\" quaintly says one\r\nold writer. And the Rev. Gerard Smith still further voices the belief of\r\nthe people as to the nature of these grassy rings:\r\n\r\n            \"The nimble elves\r\n    That do by moonshine green sour ringlets make,\r\n    Whereof the ewe bites not; whose pastime 'tis\r\n    To make these midnight mushrooms.\"\r\n\r\nIt is a very common plant, and it will pay any one to know it, as we\r\ncannot find anything in the markets that will equal it as a table\r\ndelicacy.\r\n\r\nFound in pastures and lawns during rainy weather from May till frost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 102.--Marasmius oreades. Showing a fairy ring.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marasmius urens. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE STINGING MARASMIUS.\r\n\r\nUrens means burning; so called from its acrid taste.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is pale-buff, tough, fleshy, convex or flat, becoming\r\ndepressed and finally wrinkled, smooth, even, one to two inches broad.\r\n\r\nThe gills are unequal, cream-colored, becoming brownish, much closer\r\nthan in the Fairy Ring, hardly reaching the stem proper, joined behind.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid above and hollow below, fibrous, pale, its surface\r\nmore or less covered with flocculent down, and densely covered with\r\nwhite down at the base.\r\n\r\nIt will be well for collectors to pass by this and M. peronatus, or to\r\nexercise the greatest caution in their use. They have been eaten without\r\nharm, but they also have so long been branded as poisonous that too\r\ngreat care cannot be taken. Its taste is acrid, and it grows in lawns\r\nand pastures from June to September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marasmius androsaceus. Linn._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 103.--Marasmius androsaceus. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nAndrosaceus is from a Greek word which means an unidentified sea plant\r\nor zoophyte.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is three to six lines broad, membranaceous, convex, with a\r\nslight depression, pale-reddish, darker in the center, striate, smooth.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, frequently quite simple and few in\r\nnumber, about fifteen, with shorter ones between, sometimes forked,\r\nwhitish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is one to two inches long, horny, filiform, hollow, quite\r\nsmooth, black, often twisted when dry. The spores are 7×3-4µ.\r\n\r\nThis is a very attractive little plant found on the leaves in the woods\r\nafter a rain. They are quite abundant. Found from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marasmius foetidus. Sow._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 104.--Marasmius foetidus.]\r\n\r\nFoetidus means stinking or foetid.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is submembranaceous, tough, convex, then expanded, umbilicate\r\nstriato-plicate, turning pale when dry, subpruinose.\r\n\r\nThe gills are annulato-adnexed, distant, rufescent with a yellow tinge.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow, minutely velvety, bay, base flocculose.\r\n\r\nThe caps are light brownish-red in color, fading when dry. When fresh it\r\nhas a foetid odor quite perceptible for such small plants. It is found\r\non decayed sticks and leaves in woods. During wet weather or after heavy\r\nrains it is quite common in the woods about Chillicothe.\r\n\r\nFound from July to October.\r\n\r\nThis is also called Heliomyces foetens (Pat.) and is so classified by\r\nProf. Morgan in his very excellent Monogram on North American Species of\r\nMarasmius.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marasmius velutipes. B. & C._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 105.--Marasmius velutipes.]\r\n\r\nVelutipes means velvet-footed, from the velvety stem. The pileus is\r\nthin, submembranaceous, smooth, convex, or expanded, grayish-rufous when\r\nmoist, cinereous when dry, a half to one and a half inches broad.\r\n\r\nThe gills are very narrow, crowded, whitish or grayish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is slender, three to five inches long, equal, hollow, clothed\r\nwith a dense grayish velvety tomentum. _Peck._\r\n\r\nThey usually grow in a very crowded condition, many plants growing from\r\none mat of mycelium. It is quite a common plant with us, found in damp\r\nwoods or around a swampy place. The pileus with us is convex. Some\r\nauthorities speak of an umbilicate cap. The plant is quite hardy and\r\neasily identified because of its long and slender stem, with the grayish\r\ntomentum at the base. Found from July to October.\r\n\r\nThe specimens in Figure 105 were found at Ashville, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marasmius cohærens. (Fr.) Bres._\r\n\r\nTHE STEMMED-MASSED MARASMIUS.

It grows on twigs, its habitat and structure\r\nare fully illustrated in the Figure 107.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is rather membranaceous, hemispherical, then plane or\r\ndepressed, pellucid, wrinkled, naked, entirely white.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnexed, ventricose, distant, not entire.\r\n\r\nThe stem is thin, stuffed, whitish, slightly pruinose, base tinged with\r\nbrown. Spores are elliptical, 4×2µ.\r\n\r\nThis plant has a wide distribution in this country. The specimens\r\nfigured were collected by H. H. York near Sandusky, Ohio, and were\r\nphotographed by Dr. Kellerman. I have found them at various points in\r\nOhio.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marasmius rotula. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE COLLARED MARASMIUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 108.--Marasmius rotula. Natural size. Caps white or pale-buff.]\r\n\r\nRotula means a little wheel.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one to three lines broad, hemispherical, umbilicate, and\r\nminutely umbonate, plaited, smooth, membranaceous, margin crenate,\r\nwhite, or pale buff, with a dark umbilicus.\r\n\r\nThe gills are broad, distant, few, equal, or occasionally with a few\r\nshort ones, of the color of the pileus, attached to a free collar\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\nThe stem is setiform, slightly flexuous, white above, then tawny, deep\r\nshining brown at the base, striate, hollow, frequently branched and\r\nsarmentose, with or without abortive pilei.--M. J. B. This plant is very\r\ncommon in woods on fallen twigs. The plants in Figure 108 were collected\r\nnear Cincinnati. This plant has a wide distribution. It is in all our\r\nOhio woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marasmius scorodonius. Fr._\r\n\r\nSTRONG-SCENTED MARASMIUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 109.--Marasmius scorodonius.]\r\n\r\nScorodonius is from a Greek word meaning like garlic.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one-half inch or more broad, reddish when young, but\r\nbecoming pale, whitish; somewhat fleshy, tough; even, soon plane,\r\nrugulose even when young, at length rugulose and crisped.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, often separating, connected by\r\nveins, crisped in drying, whitish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is at least one inch long, hollow, equal, quite smooth,\r\nshining, reddish. The spores are elliptical, 6×4µ.\r\n\r\nIt is found in woods growing on sticks and decayed wood. It is\r\nstrong-smelling. It is frequently put with other plants to give a flavor\r\nof garlic to the dish. Found from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marasmius calopus. Fr._\r\n\r\nCalopus is from two Greek words meaning beautiful and foot, so called\r\nbecause of its beautiful stem.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is rather fleshy, tough, convex, plane then depressed, even,\r\nat length rugose, whitish.\r\n\r\nThe gills are emarginate, adnexed, thin, white, in groups of 2-4.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow, equal, smooth, not rooting, shining, reddish-bay. It\r\nis found growing on twigs and fallen leaves, in the woods. Smaller than\r\nM. Scorodonius but with longer stem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marasmius prasiosmus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE LEEK-SCENTED MARASMIUS.\r\n\r\nPrasiosmus means smelling like a leek; from, _prason_, a leek. The\r\npileus is one-half to one inch broad, somewhat membranaceous, tough,\r\nbell-shaped, pale yellow or whitish, disk often darker, wrinkled.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnexed, somewhat close, white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is tough, hollow, pallid and smooth above, dilated at the base,\r\ntomentose and brown. It is found in woods adhering to oak leaves after\r\nheavy rains. It is very near M. porreus but differs from it in its gills\r\nbeing white and caps not being striated. It differs from M. terginus\r\nmainly in its habitat and leek-like scent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marasmius anomalus. Pk._\r\n\r\nAnomalus, not conforming to rule, irregular. The pileus is one to two\r\ninches broad, somewhat fleshy, tough, convex, even, reddish-gray.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three inches long, hollow, equal, smooth, pallid\r\nabove, reddish-brown below.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rotundate-free, close, narrow, whitish or pallid.\r\n_Morgan._\r\n\r\nThis is quite a pretty plant, growing on sticks among leaves in the\r\nwoods. It is larger than most of the small Marasmii found in similar\r\nhabitats.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marasmius semihirtipes. Pk._\r\n\r\nSemihirtipes means a slightly hairy foot or stem.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is thin, tough, nearly plane or depressed, smooth, sometimes\r\nstriate on the margin, hygrophanous, reddish-brown when moist,\r\nalutaceous when dry, the disk sometimes darker.\r\n\r\nThe gills are subdistant, reaching the stem, slightly venose-connected,\r\nsub-crenulate on the edge, white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal, even or finely striate, hollow, smooth above,\r\nvelvety-tomentose toward the base, reddish-brown. _Peck._\r\n\r\nThese plants are very small, often no doubt overlooked by the collector.\r\nThey are gregarious in their mode of growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marasmius longipes. Pk._\r\n\r\nLongipes means long stem or foot.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is thin, convex, smooth, finely striate on the margin,\r\ntawny-red.\r\n\r\nThe gills are not crowded, attached, white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is tall, straight, hollow, equal, covered with a downy meal,\r\nrooting, brown or fawn-color, white at the top.\r\n\r\nThese plants are quite small and slender, sometimes four to five inches\r\nhigh. They are rather common in our woods after a rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marasmius graminum. Berk._\r\n\r\nGraminum is the gen. pl. of _gramen_, which means grass.\r\n\r\nThe pileus small, membranaceous, convex, then nearly plane, umbonate,\r\ndeeply and distinctly striate or sulcate, tinged with rufous, the\r\nfurrows paler, disc brown.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to a collar that is free around the stem, few in\r\nnumber, slightly ventricose, cream-color.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, slender, equal, smooth, shining, black, whitish\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nThe spores are globose, 3-4µ.\r\n\r\nThis species is very near M. rotula but it can be easily distinguished\r\nby the pale rufescent, distinctly sulcate pileus, and its growing on\r\ngrass. I have frequently found it on the Chillicothe high school lawn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marasmius siccus. Schw._\r\n\r\nTHE BELL-SHAPED MARASMIUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XVII. Figure 110.--Marasmius siccus.\r\n\r\nNatural size. The cap ochraceous red, the disks somewhat darker, the\r\nstems shining and blackish-brown.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 111.--Marasmius siccus. Natural size. Caps deeply\r\nfurrowed and pinkish.]\r\n\r\nThis is a very beautiful plant found in the woods after a rain, growing\r\nfrom the leaves. They are found singly, but usually in groups.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is at first nearly conical, then campanulate, membranaceous,\r\ndry, smooth, furrows radiating from almost the center, growing larger as\r\nthey approach the margin, ochraceous-red, the disk a little darker.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free or slightly attached, few, distant, broad, narrowed\r\ntoward the stem, whitish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow, tough, smooth, shining, blackish-brown, two to three\r\ninches long. The pileus is about a half inch broad.\r\n\r\nThe plant is quite common in our woods. I have not found it elsewhere.\r\nThe plants in the photograph represent the pink form, which is not so\r\ncommon as the ochraceous-red. In the pink form the center of the cap and\r\nthe apex of the stem is a delicate pink, which gives the plant a\r\nbeautiful appearance.\r\n\r\nFound from June to October. I have not tested it but have no doubt of\r\nits esculent qualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marasmius fagineus. Morgan._\r\n\r\nFagineus means belonging to beech.\r\n\r\nPileus a little fleshy, convex then plane or depressed, at length\r\nsomewhat repand, rugose-striate, reddish-pallid or alutaceous.\r\n\r\nThe gills are short-adnate, somewhat crisped, close, pale reddish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, hollow, pubescent, thickened upward, concolorous; the\r\nbase somewhat tuberculose. _Morgan_, Myc. Flora M. V.\r\n\r\nThis plant is quite frequently found in our woods growing on the bark at\r\nthe base of living beech trees. Its habitat, its reddish or alutaceous\r\ncap, and its paler gills will clearly identify the species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marasmius peronatus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE MASKED MARASMIUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 112.--Marasmius peronatus. Natural size. Cap\r\nreddish-buff. Gills creamy or light reddish-brown.]\r\n\r\nPeronatus is from _pero_, a boot.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is reddish-buff, convex, slightly flattened at the top, quite\r\nwrinkled when old; diameter, at full expansion, between one and two\r\ninches, margin striate.\r\n\r\nThe gills are thin and crowded, creamy, becoming light reddish-brown,\r\ncontinuing down the stem by a short curve.\r\n\r\nThe stem is fibrous-stuffed, pale, densely clothed at the base with\r\nstiff yellowish hairs.\r\n\r\nIt grows in the woods, among dead leaves, from May till frost.\r\n\r\nIt is usually solitary yet is sometimes found in clusters. It has been\r\neaten frequently without injury, but by most writers is branded\r\npoisonous. It is quite acrid, but that disappears in cooking. The dense\r\nyellow hairs at the base of the stem appear to constitute the\r\ndistinguishing characteristic. Found from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marasmius ramealis. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 113.--Marasmius ramealis. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nRamealis means a branch or stick; so called because the plant is found\r\ngrowing on sticks, in open woods.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is very small, somewhat fleshy, plane or a trifle depressed,\r\nobtuse, not striate, slightly rugulose, opaque.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, somewhat distant, narrow, white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is about one inch long, stuffed, mealy, white, inclined to be\r\nrufescent at the base.\r\n\r\nThe spores are elliptical, 4×2µ.\r\n\r\nThis is a very pretty plant, but easily overlooked. It is found on oak\r\nand beech branches, frequently in large groups. Figure 113 illustrates\r\ntheir mode of growth and will assist the collector in identifying the\r\nspecies. Not poisonous, but too small to gather. Found from July to\r\nOctober. The specimens in Figure 113 were found in Haynes' Hollow near\r\nChillicothe and photographed by Dr. Kellerman.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marasmius saccharinus. Batsch._\r\n\r\nGRANULAR MARASMIUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nSaccharinus is from _saccharum_, sugar; it is so called because the\r\nwhite pileus looks very much like loaf sugar.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is entirely white, membranaceous, convex, somewhat papillate,\r\nsmooth, sulcate and plicate.\r\n\r\nThe gills are broadly and firmly attached to the stem, narrow, thick,\r\nvery distant, united by veins, whitish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is quite thin, thread-form, attenuated upward, at first\r\nflocculose, at length becoming smooth, inserted obliquely, reddish, pale\r\nat the apex. Spores, 5×3µ.\r\n\r\nQuite common in wet weather on dead oak limbs in woods. This plant\r\ndiffers from M. epiphyllus in its habitat, in the papillate form of its\r\npileus and the stem's being flocculose, then smooth; also in that the\r\ngills are united in a reticulated manner. Common. July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marasmius epiphyllus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE LEAF MARASMIUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nEpiphyllus means growing on leaves.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is white, membranaceous, nearly plane, at length umbilicate,\r\nsmooth, wrinkled, plicate.\r\n\r\nThe gills are firmly attached to the stem, white, connected by veins,\r\nentire, distant, few.\r\n\r\nThe stem is rather horny, bay, minutely velvety, apex pale, inserted.\r\nThe spores are 3×2µ. This plant is abundant everywhere, on fallen leaves\r\nin woods during rainy weather. July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marasmius delectans. Morgan._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 114.--Marasmius delectans. Natural size. Caps\r\nwhite. Gills broad and distant.]\r\n\r\nDelectans means pleasing or delightful.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is subcoriaceous, convex, then expanded and depressed,\r\nglabrous, rugulose, white, changing in drying to pale alutaceous.\r\n\r\nThe gills are moderately broad, unequal, rather distant, trabeculate\r\nbetween, white, emarginate, adnexed; the spores are lance-oblong,\r\nhyaline, 7-9×4µ.\r\n\r\nThe stem, arising from an abundant white-floccose mycelium, is long,\r\nslender, tapering slightly upward, smooth, brown and shining, white at\r\nthe apex.\r\n\r\nIt is found growing on old leaves in woods. The plants in the figure\r\nwere collected in the woods at Sugar Grove, Ohio, by R. A. Young, July\r\n28, 1906, and photographed by Dr. Kellerman. Found from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Marasmius nigripes. Schw._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 115.--Marasmius nigripes. Natural size. Caps and\r\ngills white, stems black.]\r\n\r\nNigripes means black foot, so called because the stems are black.\r\n\r\nTremmelloid. Pileus very thin, pure white, pruinose, rugulose-sulcate,\r\nconvex then expanded.\r\n\r\nThe gills are pure white, unequal, some of them forked, adnate, the\r\ninterstices venulose.\r\n\r\nThe stem is thickest at the apex, tapering downward, black,\r\nwhite-pruinose, the base insititious. _Morgan_.\r\n\r\nIt is found on old leaves, sticks, and old acorns and hickory-nuts. When\r\ndry, the stem loses its black color and the gills become flesh-color. It\r\nis quite common in thin and open woods. The spores are hyaline and\r\nstellate, 3-5-rayed. Found from July to October.\r\n\r\nThis is called Heliomyces nigripes by some authors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pleurotus. Fr._\r\n\r\nPleurotus is from two Greek words meaning side and ear, alluding to its\r\nmanner of growth on a log. This genus is very common everywhere in Ohio,\r\nand is easily determined by its eccentric, lateral, or even absent stem,\r\nbut it must have white spores, and the characteristics of the Agaricini.\r\n\r\nPileus fleshy in the larger species and membranaceous in the smaller\r\nforms, but never becoming woody. Stem mostly lateral or wanting; when\r\npresent, continuous with cap. Gills with sinus or broadly decurrent,\r\ntoothed.\r\n\r\nGrows in woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pleurotus ostreatus. Jacq._\r\n\r\nTHE OYSTER MUSHROOM. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 116.--Pleurotus ostreatus. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize. Often growing very large.]\r\n\r\nPileus two to six inches broad, soft, fleshy, convex, or slightly\r\ndepressed behind, subordinate, often cespitosely imbricated, moist,\r\nsmooth, margin involute; whitish, cinereous or brownish; flesh white,\r\nthe whole surface shining and satiny when dry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XVIII. Figure 117.--Pleurotus ostreatus.\r\n\r\nTwo-thirds natural size.]\r\n\r\nGills broad, decurrent, subdistant, branching at the base, white or\r\nwhitish. The stem when present is very short, firm, lateral, sometimes\r\nrough with stiff hair, hairy at the base. Spores oblong, white, .0003 to\r\n.0004 inch long, .00016 inch broad.\r\n\r\nThis is one of our most abundant mushrooms, and the easiest for the\r\nbeginner to identify. In Figures 116 and 117, you will see the plant\r\ngrowing in imbricated form apparently without any stem. In Figure 118 is\r\na variety that has a pronounced stem, showing how the stems grow\r\ntogether at the base, the slight grooving on the stems, also the\r\ndecurrent gills. In most of these plants the stems are plainly lateral,\r\nbut a few will appear to be central. It will be difficult to distinguish\r\nit from the Sapid mushroom and for table purposes there is little need\r\nto separate them. In Ohio the Oyster mushroom is very common everywhere.\r\nI have seen trees sixty to seventy feet high simply loaded with this\r\nmushroom. If one will locate a few logs or stumps upon which the Oyster\r\nmushroom grows, he can find there an abundant supply (when conditions\r\nare right for fungus growth) during the entire season. It is almost\r\nuniversally a favorite among mushroom eaters, but it must be carefully\r\nand thoroughly cooked. It grows very large and frequently in great\r\nmasses. I have often found specimens whose caps were eight to ten inches\r\nbroad. It is found from May to December.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 118.--Pleurotus ostreatus. One-half natural size,\r\nshowing gills and stems.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pleurotus salignus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE WILLOW PLEUROTUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 119.--Pleurotus ulmarius. One-third natural size.]\r\n\r\nSalignus, from _salix_, a willow. Pileus is compact, nearly halved,\r\nhorizontal, at first cushion-shaped, even, then with the disk depressed,\r\nsubstrigose, white or fuliginous. The stem, eccentric or lateral,\r\nsometimes obsolete, short, white-tomentose. The gills are decurrent,\r\nsomewhat branched, eroded, distinct at the base, nearly of the same\r\ncolor. Spores .00036 by .00015 inch. Fries.\r\n\r\nI found this species near Bowling Green on willow stumps. About every\r\nten days the stumps offered me a very excellent dish, better than any\r\nmeat market could afford. September to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pleurotus ulmarius. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE ELM PLEUROTUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nUlmarius, from _ulmus_, an elm. It takes its name from its habit of\r\ngrowing on elm trees and logs. It appears in the fall and may be found\r\nin company with the Oyster mushroom, late in December, frozen solid.\r\nThis species is frequently seen on elm trees, both dead and alive, on\r\nlive trees where they have been trimmed or injured in some way. It is\r\noften seen on elms in the cities, where the elm is a common shade tree.\r\nIts cap is large, thick and firm, smooth and broadly convex, sometimes\r\npale yellow or buff. Frequently the epidermis in the center of the cap\r\ncracks, giving the surface a tessellated appearance as in Figure 119.\r\nThe flesh is very white and quite compact. The gills are white or often\r\nbecoming tawny at maturity, broad, rounded or notched, not closely\r\nplaced, sometimes nearly decurrent. The stem is firm and solid, various\r\nin length, occasionally very short, inclined to be thick at the base and\r\ncurved so that the plant will be upright, as will be seen in Figure 119.\r\n\r\nThe cap is from three to six inches broad. A specimen that measured over\r\nten inches across the cap, was found some thirty feet high in a tree.\r\nWhile it was very large, it was quite tender and made several meals for\r\ntwo families. But this species is not limited entirely to the elm. I\r\nfound it on hickory, about Chillicothe. There are a few elm logs along\r\nmy rambles that afford me fine specimens with great regularity. Insects\r\ndo not seem to infest it as they do the ostreatus and the sapidus.\r\nSometimes, when the plant grows from the top of a log or the cut surface\r\nof a stump, the stem will be longer, straight, and in the center of the\r\ncap. This form is called by some authors var. verticalis.\r\n\r\nFor my own use I think the Elm mushroom, when properly prepared, very\r\ndelicious. Like all tree mushrooms it should be eaten when young. It is\r\neasily dried and kept for winter use. Found from September to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pleurotus petaloides. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE PETALOID PLEUROTUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 120.--Pleurotus petaloides.]\r\n\r\nThis species is so called from its likeness to the petals of a flower.\r\nPileus fleshy, spathulate, entire; margin at first involute, finally\r\nfully expanded; villous, depressed. The stem is compressed and villous,\r\noften channelled, nearly erect. The gills are strongly decurrent,\r\ncrowded, narrow, and white or whitish. Spores minutely globose, .0003 by\r\n.00015.\r\n\r\nThe plant varies very greatly in form and size. Its chief characteristic\r\nis the presence of numerous short white cystidia in the hymenium, which\r\ndot the surface of the hymenium, and under an ordinary pocket lens give\r\nto the gills a sort of fuzzy appearance. Frequently it will have the\r\nappearance of growing from the ground, but a careful examination will\r\nreveal a piece of wood of some kind, which serves as a host for the\r\nmycelium. I have found this plant but a few times, It seems to be quite\r\nrare in our state, especially in the southern part of the state. The\r\nplants in Figure 120 were photographed by Prof. G. D. Smith of Akron,\r\nOhio.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pleurotus sapidus. Kalchb._\r\n\r\nTHE SAPID PLEUROTUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 121.--Pleurotus sapidus. One-third natural size,\r\nshowing imbricated growth. Spores lilac.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 122.--Pleurotus sapidus.]\r\n\r\nSapidus, savory. This plant grows in clusters whose stems are more or\r\nless united at the base as in Figure 121. The caps when densely crowded\r\nare often irregular. They are smooth and vary much in color, being\r\nwhitish, ash-gray, brownish, yellowish-gray.\r\n\r\nThe flesh is thick and white. The gills are white or whitish, rather\r\nbroad, running down on the stem, and slightly connected, at times, by\r\noblique or transverse branches. The stem is generally short, solid,\r\nseveral usually springing from a thickened base, white or whitish and\r\neither laterally or eccentrically connected with the cap.\r\n\r\nThis plant is classed with the white-spored species, yet its spores,\r\nafter a short exposure to the air, really exhibit a pale lilac tint.\r\nThis can only be seen when the spores are in sufficient quantity and\r\nresting on a suitable surface.\r\n\r\nThe size of the plant varies, the cap being commonly from two to five\r\ninches long. It grows in woods and open places, on stumps and logs of\r\nvarious kinds. Its edible quality is quite as good as the Oyster\r\nmushroom. The only way by which it can be distinguished from the P.\r\nostreatus is by its lilac-tinted spores. It is found from June to\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate XX. Figure 123.--pleurotus Sapidus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pleurotus serotinoides. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE YELLOWISH PLEUROTUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 124.--Pleurotus serotinoides. One-third natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nSerotinoides, like serotinus, which means late-coming; from its\r\nappearing in the winter.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, one to three inches broad, compact, convex or\r\nnearly plane, viscid when young and moist, half-kidney-shaped, roundish,\r\nsolitary or crowded and imbricated, variously colored, dingy-yellow,\r\nreddish-brown, greenish-brown or olivaceous, the margin at first\r\ninvolute.\r\n\r\nThe gills are close, determinate, whitish or yellowish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is very short, lateral, thick, yellowish beneath, and minutely\r\ndowny or scaly with blackish points.\r\n\r\nThe spores are minute, elliptical, .0002 inch long, .0001 inch broad.\r\n\r\nThere is probably no difference between this and P. serotinus, the\r\nEuropean species. It is a beautiful plant. The color and size are quite\r\nvariable. I found it on Ralston's Run and in Baird's woods on Frankfort\r\nPike. It is found from September to January.\r\n\r\n_Pleurotus applicatus. Batsch._\r\n\r\nLITTLE GRAY PLEUROTUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 125.--Pleurotus applicatus. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nApplicatus means lying upon or close to; so named from the sessile\r\npileus. The pileus is one-third of an inch across, when young\r\ncup-shaped, dark cinereous, somewhat membranaceous, quite firm,\r\nresupinate, then reflexed, somewhat striate, slightly pruinose, villous\r\nat the base.\r\n\r\nThe gills are thick, broad in proportion to the size of the cap,\r\ndistant, radiating, gray, the margin lighter, sometimes the gills are as\r\ndark as the pileus.\r\n\r\nSometimes it is attached only by the center of the pileus; sometimes,\r\ngrowing on the side of a shelving log, it is attached laterally. It is\r\nnot as abundant as some other forms of Pleurotus. It differs from P.\r\ntremulus in absence of a distinct stem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pleurotus cyphellæformis. Berk._\r\n\r\nCyphellæformis means shaped like the hollows of the ears. The pileus is\r\ncup-shaped, pendulous, downy or mealy, upper layer gelatinous, gray,\r\nvery minutely hairy, especially at the base, margin paler.\r\n\r\nThe gills are narrow, rather distant, pure white, alternate ones being\r\nshorter. These are very small plants, found only in damp places on dead\r\nherbaceous plants. They resemble a Cyphella griseo-pallida in habit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pleurotus abscondens. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 126.--Pleurotus abscondens. Entire plant white.]\r\n\r\nAbscondens means keeping out of view. It is so called because it\r\npersists in growing in places where it is hidden from sight.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is often two and a half inches broad, delicate-white, strong\r\nstringent odor, usually pruinose, margin slightly incurved.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, rather crowded, very white, somewhat\r\nnarrow.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, solid, pruinose, usually lateral, and curved.\r\n\r\nThe plant usually grows in hollow stumps or logs, and in this case the\r\nstem is always lateral and the plant grows very much as does the P.\r\nostreatus, except that they are not imbricated. Occasionally the plant\r\nis found on the bottom of a hollow log and in that case the cap is\r\ncentral and considerably depressed in the center. I have never seen it\r\ngrowing except in a hollow stump or log. Its manner of growth and its\r\ndelicate shape of white will serve to identify it. It is found from\r\nAugust to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pleurotus circinatus. Fr._\r\n\r\nCircinatus means to make round, referring to the shape of the pileus.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to three inches broad, white, plane, orbicular, convex\r\nat first, even, covered over with silky-pruinose lustre.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnate-decurrent, rather crowded, quite broad, white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal, smooth, one to two inches long, stuffed, central or\r\nslightly eccentric, rooted at the base.\r\n\r\nThe form of these plants is quite constant and the round white caps will\r\nat first suggest a Collybia. The white gills and its decurrent form\r\nwill distinguish it from P. lignatilis. It makes quite a delicious dish\r\nwhen well cooked. I found some beautiful specimens on a decayed beech\r\nlog in Poke Hollow. Found in September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactarius. Fr._\r\n\r\nLactarius means pertaining to milk. There is one feature of this genus\r\nthat should easily mark it, the presence of milky or colored juice which\r\nexudes from a wound or a broken place on a fresh plant. This feature\r\nalone is sufficient to distinguish the genus but there are other points\r\nthat serve to make the determination more certain.\r\n\r\nThe flesh, although it seems quite solid and firm, is very brittle. The\r\nfracture is always even, clean cut, and not ragged as in more fibrous\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nThe plants are fleshy and stout, and in this particular resemble the\r\nClitocybes, but the brittleness of the flesh, milky juice, and the\r\nmarking of the cap, will easily distinguish them.\r\n\r\nMany species have a very acrid or peppery flavor. If a person tastes one\r\nwhen raw, he will not soon forget it. This acridity is usually lost in\r\ncooking.\r\n\r\nThe pileus in all species is fleshy, becoming more or less depressed,\r\nmargin at first involute, often marked with concentric zones.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stout, often hollow when old, confluent with the cap.\r\n\r\nThe gills are usually unequal, edge acute, decurrent or adnate, milky;\r\nin nearly all the species the milk is white, changing to a sulphur\r\nyellow, red, or violet, on exposure to the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactarius torminosus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE WOOLLY LACTARIUS. POISONOUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 127.--Lactarius torminosus. Three-fourths natural\r\nsize. Caps yellowish-red or ochraceous tinged with red, margin\r\nincurved.]\r\n\r\nTorminosus, full of grips, causing colic. The pileus is two to four\r\ninches broad, convex, then depressed, smooth, or nearly so, except the\r\ninvolute margin which is more or less shaggy, somewhat zoned, viscid\r\nwhen young and moist, yellowish-red or pale ochraceous, tinged with red.\r\n\r\nThe gills are thin, close, rather narrow, nearly of the same color as\r\nthe pileus, but yellower and paler, slightly forked, subdecurrent.\r\n\r\nThe stem is one to two inches long, paler than the cap, equal or\r\nslightly tapering downward, stuffed or hollow, sometimes spotted,\r\nclothed with a very minute adpressed down.\r\n\r\nThe milk is white and very acrid. The spores are echinulate, subglobose,\r\n9-10×7-8µ.\r\n\r\nThis differs from L. cilicioides in its zoned pileus and white milk.\r\nMost authorities speak of it as dangerous. Captain McIlvaine speaks of\r\nthe Russians as preserving it in salt and eating it seasoned with oil\r\nand vinegar. They grow in the woods, open places, and in fields. The\r\nspecimens in Figure 127 were found in Michigan and photographed by Dr.\r\nFischer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactarius piperatus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE PEPPERY LACTARIUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 128.--Lactarius piperatus. One-third natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nPiperatus--having a peppery taste. The pileus is creamy-white, fleshy,\r\nfirm, convex, then expanded, depressed in the center, dry, never viscid,\r\nand quite broad.\r\n\r\nThe gills are creamy-white, narrow, close, unequal, forked, decurrent,\r\nadnate, exuding a milky juice when bruised, milky-white, very acrid.\r\n\r\nThe stem is creamy white, short, thick, solid, smooth, rounded at the\r\nend, slightly tapering at the base. Spores generally with an apiculus,\r\n.0002 by .00024 inch.\r\n\r\nThe plant is found in all parts of Ohio, but most people are afraid of\r\nit on account of its very peppery taste. Although it can be eaten\r\nwithout harm, it will never prove a favorite.\r\n\r\nIt is found in open woods from July to October. In its season is one of\r\nthe very common plants in all of our woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactarius pergamenus. Fr._\r\n\r\nPergamenus is from _pergamena_, parchment. The pileus is convex, then\r\nexpanded, plane, depressed, wavy, wrinkled, without zones, often repand,\r\nsmooth, white.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnate, very narrow, tinged with straw-color, often white,\r\nbranched, much crowded, horizontal.\r\n\r\nThe stem is smooth, stuffed, discolored, not long. The milk is white and\r\nacrid. Spores, 8×6. It differs from L. piperatus in its crowded, narrow\r\ngills and longer stem. Found in woods from August to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactarius deceptivus. Pk._\r\n\r\nDECEIVING LACTARIUS. EDIBLE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 129.--Lactarius deceptivus.]\r\n\r\nDeceptivus means deceiving.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is three to five inches broad, compact, at first convex, and\r\numbilicate, then expanded and centrally depressed or subinfundibuliform,\r\nobsoletely tomentose or glabrous except on the margin, white or whitish,\r\noften varied with yellowish or sordid strains, the margin at first\r\ninvolute and clothed with a dense, soft cottony tomentum, then spreading\r\nor elevated and more or less fibrillose.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rather broad, distant or subdistant, adnate or decurrent,\r\nsome of them, forked, whitish, becoming cream-colored.\r\n\r\nThe stem is one to three inches long, equal or narrowed downward, solid,\r\npruinose-pubescent, white. Spores are white, 9-12.7µ. Milk white, taste\r\nacrid.\r\n\r\nThis plant delights in woods and open groves, especially under\r\nconiferous trees. It is a large, meaty, acrid white species, with a\r\nthick, soft, cottony tomentum on the margin of the pileus of the young\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nThe specimen photographed was sent me from Massachusetts by Mrs.\r\nBlackford. It grows in July, August and September. Its sharp acridity is\r\nlost in cooking, but like all acrid Lactarius it is coarse and not very\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactarius indigo. (Schw.) Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 130.--Lactarius indigo. One-third natural size.\r\nEntire plant indigo blue.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 131.--Lactarius indigo. One-third natural size,\r\nshowing gills.]\r\n\r\nThis is one of our most striking plants. No one can fail to recognize\r\nit, because of the deep indigo blue that pervades the whole plant. I\r\nhave found it in only one place, near what is known as the Lone-Tree\r\nHill near Chillicothe. I have found it there on several different\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is from three to five inches broad, the very young plants\r\nseem to be umbilicate with the margin strongly incurved, then depressed\r\nor funnel-shaped; as the plant ages the margin is elevated and sometimes\r\nwaved. The entire plant is indigo blue, and the surface of the cap has\r\na silvery-gray appearance through which the indigo color is seen. The\r\nsurface of the cap is marked with a series of concentric zones of darker\r\nshade, as will be seen in Figure 130 especially on the margin; sometimes\r\nspotted, becoming paler and less distinctly zonate with age or in\r\ndrying.\r\n\r\nThe gills are crowded, indigo blue, becoming yellowish and sometimes\r\ngreenish, with age.\r\n\r\nThe stem is one to two inches long, short, nearly equal, hollow, often\r\nspotted with blue, colored like the pileus.\r\n\r\nIt is edible but rather coarse. Found in open woods July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactarius regalis. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 132.--Lactarius regalis. Natural size. Caps white,\r\ntinged with yellow.]\r\n\r\nRegalis means regal; so named from its large size. The pileus is four to\r\nsix inches broad, convex, deeply depressed in the center; viscid when\r\nmoist; often corrugated on the margin; white, tinged with yellow.\r\n\r\nThe gills are close, decurrent, whitish, some of them forked at the\r\nbase.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three inches long and one inch thick, short, equal,\r\nhollow. The taste is acrid and the milk sparse, white, quickly changing\r\nto sulphur-yellow. The spores are .0003 of an inch in diameter. _Peck._\r\n\r\nThis is frequently a very large plant, resembling in appearance L.\r\npiperatus but easily recognized because of its viscid cap and its spare\r\nmilk changing to yellow, as in L. chrysorrhæus. It grows on the ground\r\nin the woods, in August and September. I find it here chiefly on the\r\nhillsides. The specimens in Figure 132 were found in Michigan and\r\nphotographed by Dr. Fischer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactarius scrobiculatus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE SPOTTED-STEMMED LACTARIUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 133.--Lactarius scrobiculatus. Natural size. Caps reddish-yellow,\r\nzoned. Margin very much incurved, stem pitted.]\r\n\r\nScrobiculatus is from _scrobis_, a trench, and _ferro_, to bear,\r\nreferring to the pitted condition of the stem. The pileus is convex,\r\ncentrally depressed, more or less zoned, reddish-yellow, viscid, the\r\nmargin very much incurved, downy.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnate, or slightly decurrent, whitish, and often very\r\nmuch curled, because of the incurved condition of the cap at first.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal, stuffed, adorned often with pits of a darker color.\r\n\r\nThe spores are white, juice white, then yellowish.\r\n\r\nThe plant is very acrid to the taste, and solid. Too hot to be eaten. I\r\nhave found it only a few times on the hills of Huntington township, near\r\nChillicothe. The yellowish hue and markedly incurved margin will\r\nidentify the plant. Found in August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactarius trivialis. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 134.--Lactarius trivialis. One-half natural size.\r\nCaps light tan with a pinkish hue. Very acrid.]\r\n\r\nTrivialis means common.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is three to four inches broad, usually damp or watery,\r\nsometimes quite viscid, shining when dry, convex, then expanded,\r\ndepressed in the center, margin at first incurved, even, smooth; warm,\r\nsoft tan, rather light, and sometimes a very slight pinkish hue\r\nprevails. The flesh is solid and persistent.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rather crowded, slightly decurrent, at first whitish,\r\nthen a light yellow, many not reaching to the stem, none forked. The\r\nstem is from three to four inches long, of same color as the pileus,\r\noften a much lighter shade; tapering from the cap to the base, smooth,\r\nstuffed, and finally hollow. The plant is quite full of milk, white at\r\nfirst, then turning yellowish.\r\n\r\nThe plant is very acrid and peppery. It is quite plentiful along the\r\nstreams of Ross county, Ohio. It is not poisonous, but it seems too hot\r\nto eat. It is found after rains from July to October, in mixed woods\r\nwhere it is damp.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactarius insulsus. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 135.--Lactarius insulsus. One-third natural size.\r\nCaps yellowish or straw color. Very acrid.]\r\n\r\nInsulsus, insipid or tasteless. This is a very attractive plant. Quite\r\nsolid and maintains its form for several days; The pileus is two to four\r\ninches broad, convex, depressed in the center, then funnel-shaped,\r\nsmooth, viscid when moist, more or less zoned, the zones much narrower\r\nthan L. scrobiculatus, yellowish or straw-color, margin slightly\r\nincurved and naked.\r\n\r\nThe gills are thin, rather crowded, adnate and sometimes decurrent, some\r\nof them forked at the base, whitish or pallid. Spores subglobose, rough,\r\n10×8µ.\r\n\r\nThe stem is one to two inches long, equal or slightly tapering downward,\r\nstuffed, whitish, generally spotted. Milk, white.\r\n\r\nMost authorities class this as an edible plant, but it is so hot and the\r\nflesh so solid that I have never tried it. I found two plants which\r\nfully answered the description of the European plants. The zones were\r\norange-yellow and brick-red. I have visited the place many times since,\r\nbut have never been able to find another. It is not an abundant plant\r\nwith us. Found from July to October, in open woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactarius lignyotus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE SOOTY LACTARIUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate XXI. Figure, 136.--Lactarius lignyotus.\r\n\r\nNatural size. Caps a sooty umber. Flesh mild to the taste.]\r\n\r\nLignyotus is from _lignum_, wood. The pileus is one to four inches in\r\ndiameter, fleshy, convex, then expanded, sometimes slightly umbonate,\r\noften in age slightly depressed, smooth or often wrinkled, pruinosely\r\nvelvety, sooty umber, the margin in the old plants wavy and distinctly\r\nplaited; the flesh white and mild to the taste.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem; unequal; snow-white or\r\nyellowish-white, slowly changing to a pinkish-red or salmon color when\r\nbruised; distant in old plants.\r\n\r\nThe stem is one to three inches long, equal, abruptly constricted at the\r\napex, smooth, stuffed, of the same color as the pileus. Milk white,\r\ntaste mild or tardily acrid. The spores are globose, yellowish,\r\n9-11.3µ.\r\n\r\nThis is called the Sooty Lactarius and is very easily identified. It\r\nwill be frequently found associated with the Smoky Lactarius which it\r\ngreatly resembles. It seems to delight in wet swampy woods. It is said\r\nto be one of the best of the Lactarii. The specimens in Figure 136 were\r\ncollected at Sandusky, Ohio, and photographed by Dr. Kellerman.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactarius cinereus. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 137.--Lactarius cinereus.]\r\n\r\nCinereus is from _cineres_, ashes; so called from the color of the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one to two and a half inches broad, zoneless, somewhat\r\nviscid, floccose-scaly, depressed in the center, margin thin, even,\r\nflesh thin and white, mild to the taste, ashy-gray.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnate, rather close, sometimes forked (usually near the\r\nstem), uneven, white or creamy-white, milk white, not plentiful.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three inches long, tapering upward, loosely stuffed,\r\nfinally hollow, often floccose at the base.\r\n\r\nThis plant is quite common from September to November, growing in damp\r\nweather on leaves in mixed woods. It has a mild taste. While I have not\r\neaten it I have no doubt of its edibility. The color of the pileus is\r\nsometimes quite dark.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactarius griseus. Pk._\r\n\r\nGRAY LACTARIUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 138.--Lactarius griseus.]\r\n\r\nGriseus means gray.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is thin, nearly plane, broadly umbilicate or centrally\r\ndepressed, sometimes infundibuliform, generally with a small umbo or\r\npapilla, minutely squamulose tomentose, gray or brownish-gray, becoming\r\npaler with age.\r\n\r\nThe gills are thin, close, adnate, or slightly decurrent, whitish or\r\nyellowish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is slender, equal or slightly tapering upward, rather fragile;\r\nstuffed or hollow; generally villose or tomentose at the base; paler\r\nthan, or colored like, the pileus.\r\n\r\nThe spores are .0003 to .00035 inch; milk white, taste subacrid. Pileus\r\nis 6 to 18 lines broad, stem 1 to 2 inches long, 1 to 3 lines thick.\r\n_Peck._\r\n\r\nIt resembles L. mammosus and L. cinereus. It differs from the former in\r\nnot having ferruginous gills and pubescent stems, and from the latter by\r\nits smaller size, its densely pubescent pileus, and its habitat. It\r\ngrows on mossy logs or in mossy swamps. The base of one of the plants in\r\nFigure 138 is covered with the moss in which they grew. These plants\r\nwere found in Purgatory Swamp, near Boston, by Mrs. Blackford. They grow\r\nfrom July to September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactarius distans. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE DISTANT-GILLED LACTARIUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nDistans means distant, so called because the gills are very wide apart.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is firm, broadly convex or nearly plane, umbilicate or\r\nslightly depressed in the center; with a minute, velvety pruinosity;\r\nyellowish-tawny or brownish-orange.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rather broad, distant, adnate or slightly decurrent, white\r\nor creamy yellow, interspaces veined; milk white, mild.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, equal or tapering downward, solid, pruinose, colored\r\nlike the pileus.\r\n\r\nThe spores are subglobose, 9-11µ broad. _Peck_, N. Y. Report, 52.\r\n\r\nI frequently mistake this plant for L. volemus when seen growing in the\r\nground, but the widely separated gills distinguish the plant as soon as\r\nit is gathered. The stem is short and round, tapering downward, solid,\r\ncolored like the pileus. The milk is both white and mild. I find it on\r\nnearly every wooded hillside about Chillicothe. It is found from July to\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactarius atroviridus. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE DARK-GREEN LACTARIUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 139.--Lactarius atroviridus. Cap and stem dark\r\ngreen. Cap depressed in center. Gills white.]\r\n\r\nAtroviridus is from _ater_, black; _viridus_, green; so called from the\r\ncolor of the cap and the stem of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is convex, plane, then depressed in the center, with an\r\nadherent pellicle, greenish with darker scales, margin involute.\r\n\r\nThe gills are slightly decurrent, whitish, broad, distant; milk white\r\nbut not copious as in many of the Lactarii.\r\n\r\nThe stem is quite short, tapering downward, dark green, scaly.\r\n\r\nThe stem is so short that the cap seems to be right on the ground, hence\r\nit is very easily overlooked. It is found only occasionally on mossy\r\nhillsides, where there are not too many leaves. The plant in Figure 139\r\nwas found in Haynes' Hollow, near Chillicothe. I have found the plant on\r\ntop of Mt. Logan. It is found from July to October. I do not know of its\r\nedibility. All specimens that I have found I have sent to my Mycological\r\nfriends. It should be tasted with caution.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactarius subdulcis. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE SWEET LACTARIUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 140.--Lactarius subdulcis.]\r\n\r\nSubdulcis means almost sweet, or sweetish.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to three inches broad, rather thin, papillate, convex,\r\nthen depressed, smooth, even, zoneless, cinnamon-red or tawny-red,\r\nmargin sometimes wavy.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rather narrow, thin, close, whitish, often reddish or\r\ntinged with red. Spores, 9-10µ.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stuffed, then hollow, equal, slightly tapering upward,\r\nslender, smooth, sometimes villous at the base. The milk is white,\r\nsometimes rather acrid and unpleasant to the taste when raw. It needs to\r\nbe cooked a long time to make it good.\r\n\r\nIt is likely to be found anywhere, but it does best in damp places. The\r\nplants found with us all seem to have red or cinnamon-red gills,\r\nespecially before the spores begin to fall. They are found growing on\r\nthe ground, among leaves, or on well-rotted wood and sometimes on the\r\nbare ground. Found from July to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactarius serifluus. Fr._\r\n\r\nSerifluus means flowing with serum, the watery part of milk.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, depressed in the center, dry, smooth, not zoned,\r\ntawny-brown, margin thin, incurved.\r\n\r\nThe gills are crowded, light-brown, or yellowish, milk scanty and\r\nwatery.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, equal, paler than the pileus. Spores, 7-8µ.\r\n\r\nIt differs from L. subdulcis in having a solid stem and perhaps a shade\r\ndarker color. Found in woods, July to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactarius corrugis. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE WRINKLED LACTARIUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 141.--Lactarius corrugis. Caps wrinkled,\r\ntawny-brown. Gills orange-brown.]\r\n\r\nCorrugis means wrinkled.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is convex, plane, expanded, slightly depressed in the center;\r\nsurface of the cap wrinkled, dry, bay-brown; margin at first involute.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnexed, broad, yellowish or brownish-yellow, growing\r\npaler with age. The stem is rather short, equal, solid, pruinose, of the\r\nsame color as the pileus. The spores are subglobose, 10-13µ.\r\n\r\nThis species looks very much like L. volemus, and its only essential\r\ndifference is in the wrinkled form, and color of the pileus. The milk\r\nwhen dry is very sticky and becomes rather black. It has just a touch of\r\nacridity.\r\n\r\nAny one determining this species will not fail to note the number of\r\nbrown cystidia or setæ, in the hymenium, which project above the surface\r\nof the gills. They are so numerous and so near the edge of the gills\r\nthat they give these a downy appearance. The quality of this species is\r\neven better than L. volemus, though it is not as abundant here as the\r\nlatter. Found in thin woods from August to September. The photograph,\r\nFigure 141, was made by Prof. H. C. Beardslee.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactarius volemus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE ORANGE-BROWN LACTARIUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by Prof. Atkinson._\r\n\r\nFigure 142.--Lactarius volemus. Natural size. Caps golden-tawny. Milk\r\ncopious, as will be seen where the plant has been pricked.]\r\n\r\n_Volemus from volema pira, a kind of a pear_, so called from the shape\r\nof the stem. The pileus is broad, flesh thick, compact, rigid, plane,\r\nthen expanded, obtuse, dry, golden-tawny, at length somewhat wrinkly.\r\n\r\nThe gills are crowded, adnate or slightly decurrent, white, then\r\nyellowish; milk copious, sweet.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, hard, blunt, generally curved like a pear-stem; its\r\ncolor is that of the pileus but a shade lighter. Spores globose, white.\r\n\r\nThe milk in this species is very abundant and rather pleasant to the\r\ntaste. It becomes quite sticky as it dries on your hands. This plant has\r\na good record among mushroom eaters, both in this country and Europe.\r\n\r\nThere is no danger of mistaking it. The plants grow in damp woods from\r\nJuly to September. They are found singly or in patches. They were found\r\nquite plentifully about Salem, Ohio, and also about Chillicothe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactarius deliciosus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE DELICIOUS LACTARIUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 143.--Lactarius deliciosus. One-third natural\r\nsize. Caps light reddish-yellow. Milk orange color.]\r\n\r\nDeliciosus, delicious. The pileus is three to five inches broad; color\r\nvarying from yellow to dull orange or even brownish-yellow with mottled\r\nconcentric zones of deeper color, especially in younger plants,\r\nsometimes a light reddish-yellow, without apparent zones (as is the case\r\nof those in Figure 143); convex, when expanded becoming very much\r\ndepressed; funnel-shaped; smooth, moist, sometimes irregular, wavy;\r\nflesh brittle, creamy, more or less stained with orange.\r\n\r\nThe gills are slightly decurrent in the depressed specimens, somewhat\r\ncrowded, forked at the stem, short ones beginning at the margin; when\r\nbruised exuding a copious supply of milky juice of an orange color; a\r\npale tan-color, turning green in age or in drying. Spores are\r\nechinulate, 9-10×7-8µ.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three inches or more, equal, smooth, hollow, slightly\r\npruinose, paler than the cap, occasionally spotted with orange, tinged\r\nwith green in old plants.\r\n\r\nThe taste of the raw plant is slightly peppery. It grows in damp woods\r\nand is sometimes quite common. Its name suggests the estimation in which\r\nit is held by all who have eaten it. Like all Lactarii it must be well\r\ncooked. The specimens in Figure 143 were gathered on Cemetery Hill close\r\nto the pine trees and in company with Boletus Americanus. Found from\r\nJuly to November. I found the plant in a more typical form about Salem,\r\nOhio.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactarius uvidus. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 144.--Lactarius uvidus.]\r\n\r\nUvidus is from _uva_, grape, so called because when exposed to the air\r\nchanges to the color of a grape.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to four inches broad, flesh rather thin, convex,\r\nsometimes slightly umbonate, then depressed in the center, not zoned,\r\nviscid, dingy pale ochraceous-tan, margin at first involute, naked, milk\r\nmild at first then becoming acrid, white changing to lilac.\r\n\r\nThe gills are thin, slightly decurrent, crowded, shorter ones very\r\nobtuse and truncate behind, connected by veins, white, when wounded\r\nbecoming lilac.\r\n\r\nThe stem is soon hollow, two to three inches long, viscid, pallid.\r\n\r\nThe spores are round, 10µ.\r\n\r\nNot only the milk changes to a lilac when cut, but the flesh itself.\r\nThey are found in damp woods during August and September. The plants in\r\nFigure 144 were found near Boston, by Mrs. Blackford. These plants grew\r\nin Purgatory Swamp. The Sphagnum moss will be seen at the base of the\r\nupright plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactarius chrysorrheus. Fr._\r\n\r\nYELLOW-JUICED LACTARIUS.\r\n\r\nChrysorrheus from two Greek words; _chrysos_, yellow or golden; _reo_, I\r\nflow, because the juice soon turns to a golden yellow.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is rather fleshy, depressed, then funnel-shaped,\r\nyellowish-flesh colored, marked with dark zones or spots.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stuffed, then hollow, equal, or tapering below, paler than\r\nthe pileus, sometimes pitted.\r\n\r\nThe gills are decurrent, thin, crowded, yellowish, milk white, then\r\ngolden-yellow, very acrid.\r\n\r\nThe milk is white, quite acrid, has a peculiar taste, and changes at\r\nonce on exposure to a beautiful yellow. This is a common species about\r\nSalem, Ohio, and is quite variable in size. Found in woods and groves\r\nfrom July to October. I do not know whether its edible quality has ever\r\nbeen tested. When I found it some years ago I had less faith in\r\nmushrooms than I have now.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lactarius vellereus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE WOOLY-WHITE LACTARIUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nVellereus from vellus, a fleece. The pileus is white, compact, fleshy,\r\ndepressed or convex, tomentose, zoneless, margin at first involute, milk\r\nwhite and acrid.\r\n\r\nThe gills are white or whitish, distant, forked, adnate or decurrent,\r\nconnected by veins, bow-shaped, milk scanty.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, blunt, pubescent, white, tapering downward. Spores\r\nwhite and nearly smooth, .00019 by .00034 inch.\r\n\r\nThis species is quite common; and though very acrid to the taste, this\r\nacridity is entirely lost in cooking. It will be readily known by the\r\ndowny covering of the cap. Found in thin woods and wood margins. July to\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Russula. Pers._\r\n\r\nRussula, red or reddish. The beginner will have little difficulty in\r\ndetermining this genus. There is such a strong family likeness that,\r\nfinding one, he will say at once it is a Russula. The contour of the\r\ncap, the brittleness of its flesh and of its stem, the fragile gills,\r\nand the failure of any part of the plant to exude a milky or colored\r\njuice, the many gay colors--will all help in determining the genus.\r\n\r\nMany species of Russula strongly resemble those of the genus Lactarius,\r\nin size, shape, and texture. The spores, too, are quite similar, but the\r\nabsence of the milky juice will mark the difference at once.\r\n\r\nThe cap may be red, purple, violet, pink, blue, yellow, or green. The\r\ncolored zones often seen in the Lactarii do not appear here. The\r\nbeginner will possibly find trouble in identifying species, because of\r\nvariation of size and color. The spores are white to very pale yellow,\r\ngenerally spiny. The pileus is fleshy, convex, then expanded, and at\r\nlength depressed. The stem is brittle, stout, and smooth, generally\r\nspongy within, and confluent with the cap. The gills are milkless, with\r\nacute edge, and very tender.\r\n\r\nCaptain McIlvaine, in his very valuable book, One Thousand American\r\nFungi, says: \"To this genus authors have done special injustice; there\r\nis not a single species among them known to be poisonous, and where they\r\nare not too strong of cherry bark and other highly flavored substances,\r\nthey are all edible; most of them favorites.\" I can testify to the fact\r\nthat many of them are favorites, though a few are very peppery and it\r\nrequires some courage to attack them.\r\n\r\nThey are all found on the ground in open woods, from early summer to\r\nlate fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Russula delica. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE WEANED RUSSULA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nDelica means weaned, so called because, though it resembles Lactarius\r\nvellereus in appearance, it is void of milk.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is quite large, fleshy, firm, depressed, even, shining,\r\nmargin involute, smooth, not striated.\r\n\r\nThe gills are decurrent, thin, distant, unequal, white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, compact, white, short.\r\n\r\nSpecimens will be found that resemble Lactarius piperatus and L.\r\nvellereus, but they may be easily distinguished because they have no\r\nmilk in their gills and the taste is mild. They are not equal to most of\r\nthe Russulas. Found in woods from August to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Russula adusta. Pers._\r\n\r\nTHE SMOKY RUSSULA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 145.--Russula adusta.]\r\n\r\nAdusta means burned.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fuliginous, cinereous, flesh compact, margin even and\r\ninflexed, depressed in the center.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, decurrent, thin, crowded, unequal,\r\nwhite, not reddening when bruised.\r\n\r\nThe stem is obese, solid, of the same color as the pileus, not turning\r\nred when bruised.\r\n\r\nThe plant resembles R. nigricans, but can readily be distinguished from\r\nit because of the thin, crowded gills and failure to turn red when cut\r\nor bruised. The spores are subglobose, almost smooth, 8-9µ; no\r\ncystidia. It is found in the woods during August and September. Edible\r\nbut not first class. It is a plant very widely distributed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Russula nigricans. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 146.--Russula nigricans.]\r\n\r\nNigricans means blackish.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to four inches broad, dark grayish-brown, black with\r\nadvancing age, fleshy, compact, flesh turning red when bruised or\r\nconvex, flattened, then depressed, at length funnel-shaped, margin\r\nentire, without striate, margin at first incurved, young specimens are\r\nslightly viscid when moist, even, without a separable pellicle; whitish\r\nat first, soon sooty olive, at length becoming broken up into scales and\r\nblack; flesh firm and white, becoming reddish when broken.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rounded behind, slightly adnexed, thick, distant, broad,\r\nunequal, the shorter ones sometimes very scanty, forked, reddening when\r\ntouched.\r\n\r\nThe stem is rather short, thick, solid, equal, pallid when young, then\r\nblack. The spores are subglobose, rough, 8-9µ.\r\n\r\nThe plant is quite compact, inodorous, becoming entirely black with age.\r\nIt is easily distinguished from R. adusta by the flesh becoming reddish\r\nwhen bruised, and by the much thicker, and more distant gills. It is\r\nvery close to R. densifolia but differs from it in that its gills are\r\nmore distant and because of its mild taste.\r\n\r\nI am pleased to present to my readers, in Figure 146, a photograph of a\r\nplant which grew in Sweden in the locality where Prof. Fries did his\r\ngreat work in fungal study and research. It is a typical specimen of\r\nthis species. It was gathered and photographed by Mr. C. G. Lloyd.\r\n\r\nIt is found from June to October. Not poisonous, but not good.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Russula foetens. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE FETID RUSSULA. NOT EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 147.--Russula foetens.]\r\n\r\nFoetens means stinking.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is four to six inches broad, dirty white or yellowish; flesh\r\nthin; at first hemispherical, then expanded, almost plane, often\r\ndepressed in the center; covered with a pellicle which is adnate; viscid\r\nin wet weather; widely striate-tuberculate on the margin, which is at\r\nfirst incurved.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnexed, connected by veins, crowded, irregular, many\r\nforked, rather broad, whitish, becoming dingy when bruised, exuding\r\nwatery drops at first.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stout, stuffed, then hollow, concolor, two to four inches\r\nlong. The spores are small, echinulate, almost round.\r\n\r\nI have found the plants very generally diffused over the state. It is\r\nvery coarse and uninviting. Its smell and taste are bad. Found from July\r\nto October. These plants are widely distributed and usually rather\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Russula alutacea. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE TAN-COLORED RUSSULA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 148.--Russula alutacea. Two-thirds natural size.\r\nCaps flesh color. Gills broad and yellowish.]\r\n\r\nAlutacea, tanned leather. The pileus is flesh-color, sometimes red;\r\nflesh white; bell-shaped, then convex; expanded, with a viscid covering,\r\ngrowing pale; slightly depressed; even; margin inclined to be thin,\r\nstriate.\r\n\r\nThe gills are broad, ventricose, free, thick, somewhat distant, equal,\r\nyellow, then ochraceous.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stout, solid, even; white, though parts of the stem are red,\r\nsometimes purple; wrinkled lengthwise; spongy. The spores are yellow.\r\n\r\nThe taste is mild and pleasant when young, but quite acrid when old.\r\nAlutacea will be known mostly by its mild taste, broad, and yellow\r\ngills. It is quite common, but does not grow in groups. It is sweet and\r\nnutty.\r\n\r\nFrom July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Russula ochrophylla. Pk._\r\n\r\nOCHREY GILLED RUSSULA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nOchrophylla is from two Greek words meaning _ochre_ and _leaf_, because\r\nof its ochre-colored gills.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to four inches broad, firm, convex, becoming nearly\r\nplane or slightly depressed in the center; even, or rarely very slightly\r\nstriate on the margin when old; purple or dark purplish-red; flesh\r\nwhite, purplish under the adnate cuticle; taste mild.\r\n\r\nThe gills are entire, a few of them forked at the base, subdistant,\r\nadnate at first yellowish, becoming bright, ochraceous-buff when mature\r\nand dusted by the spores, the interspaces somewhat venose.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal or nearly so, solid or spongy within, reddish or rosy\r\ntinted, paler than the pileus. The spores are bright, ochraceous-buff,\r\nglobose, verruculose, .0004 of an inch broad. _Peck._\r\n\r\nThis is one of the easiest Russulas to determine because of its purple\r\nor purplish-red cap, entire gills, at first yellowish, then a bright,\r\nochraceous-buff when mature. The taste is mild and the flavor fairly\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nThere is also a plant which has a purplish cap and a white stem, called\r\nRussula ochrophylla albipes. Pk. It quite agrees in its edible qualities\r\nwith the former.\r\n\r\nR. ochrophylla is found in the woods, especially under oak trees, in\r\nJuly and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Russula lepida. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE NEAT RUSSULA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 149.--Russula lepida. Two-thirds natural size.\r\nCaps, purplish-red, with more or less brown.]\r\n\r\nLepida, from _lepidus_, neat.\r\n\r\nThe pileus firm, solid; varying in color from bright red to dull,\r\nsubdued purplish with a distinct brown; compact; convex, then depressed,\r\ndry unpolished; margin even, sometimes cracked and scaly, not striated.\r\n\r\nThe gills are white, broad, principally even, occasionally forked, very\r\nbrittle, rounded, somewhat crowded, connected by veins, sometimes red on\r\nthe edge, especially near the margin.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, white, usually stained and streaked with pink,\r\ncompact, even.\r\n\r\nThe surface is dull, as with a fine dust or plum-like bloom, and thus\r\nwithout polish. Often times the surface will appear almost velvety. The\r\ntints of the flesh and the gills will be found uniform. The plant when\r\nraw is sweet and nut-like to the taste. This is a beautiful species, the\r\ncolor being averaged under the general hue of dark, subdued red,\r\ninclining to maroon. It is simply delicious when properly cooked. Found\r\nin woods from July to September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Russula cyanoxantha. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE BLUE AND YELLOW RUSSULA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nCyanoxantha, from two Greek words, blue and yellow, referring to color\r\nof the plant.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is quite variable as to color, ranging from lilac or purplish\r\nto greenish; disk yellowish, margin bluish or livid-purple; convex, then\r\nplane, depressed in center; margin faintly striate, sometimes wrinkled.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rounded behind, connected by veins, forked, white,\r\nslightly crowded.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, spongy, stuffed, hollow when old, equal, smooth and\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nThe color of the cap is quite variable but the peculiar combination of\r\ncolor will assist the student in distinguishing it. It is a beautiful\r\nplant and one of the best of the Russulas to eat. The mushroom-eater\r\ncounts himself lucky indeed when he can find a basketful of this species\r\nafter \"the joiner squirrel\" has satisfied his love of this special good\r\nthing. It is quite common in woods from August to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Russula vesca. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE EDIBLE RUSSULA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nVesca from vesco, to feed. The pileus is from two to three inches broad;\r\nred-flesh-color, disk darker; fleshy; firm; convex, with a slight\r\ndepression in the center, then funnel-shaped; slightly wrinkled; margin\r\neven, or remotely striate.\r\n\r\nGills adnate, rather crowded, unequal, forked, and white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is firm, solid, sometimes peculiarly reticulated, tapering at\r\nthe base. The spores are globose, spiny, and white. I frequently found\r\nit near Salem, O., in thin chestnut woods and in pastures under such\r\ntrees. A mushroom lover will be amply paid for the long tramps if he\r\nfinds a basket full of these dainties. It is mild and sweet when raw. It\r\nis found in thin woods and in wood margins, sometimes under trees in\r\npastures, from August to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Russula virescens. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE GREEN RUSSULA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 150.--Russula virescens. Two-thirds natural size.\r\nCaps pale-green. Gills white.]\r\n\r\nVirescens, being green. The Pileus is grayish-green; at first globose,\r\nthen expanded, convex, at last depressed at the center; firm, adorned\r\nwith flaky greenish or yellow patches, produced by the cracking of the\r\nskin; two to four inches broad, margin striate, often white.\r\n\r\nThe gills are white, moderately close, free or nearly so, narrow as they\r\napproach the stem, some being forked, others not; very brittle, breaking\r\nto pieces at the slightest touch.\r\n\r\nThe stem is shorter than the diameter of the cap, smooth, white, and\r\nsolid or spongy. The spores are white, rough, and nearly globose.\r\n\r\nThis plant is especially sweet and nutty to the taste when young and\r\nunwilted. All Russulas should be eaten when fresh. I have found the\r\nplant over the state quite generally. It is a prime favorite with the\r\nsquirrels. You will often find them half eaten by these little nibblers.\r\nFound in open woods from July to September. It is one of the best\r\nmushrooms to eat and one that is very easily identified. It is quite\r\ncommon about Chillicothe, Ohio. Its mouldy color is not as prepossessing\r\nas the brighter hues of many far less delicious fungi, but it stands the\r\ntest of use.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Russula variata. Ban._\r\n\r\nVARIABLE RUSSULA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nPileus is firm, convex becoming centrally depressed or somewhat\r\nfunnel-form, viscid, even on the thin margin, reddish-purple, often\r\nvariegated with green, pea-green sometimes varied with purple, flesh\r\nwhite, taste acrid or tardily acrid.\r\n\r\nThe gills are thin, narrow, close, often forked, tapering toward each\r\nend, adnate or slightly decurrent, white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal or nearly so, solid, sometimes cavernous, white. The\r\nspores are white, subglobose, .0003 to .0004 of an inch long, .0003\r\nbroad. _Peck_, Rep. State Bot., 1905.\r\n\r\nThis plant grows in open beech woods, rather damp, and appears in July\r\nand August. The caps are often dark purple, often tinged with red, and\r\nsometimes the caps contains shades of green. I found the plants\r\nplentifully in Woodland Park, near Newtonville, Ohio, in July, 1907. We\r\nate them on several occasions and found them very good. The greenish\r\nmargin and purplish center will mark the plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Russula integra. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE ENTIRE RUSSULA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nIntegra, whole or entire. The pileus is three or four inches in\r\ndiameter, fleshy; typically red, but changing color; expanded,\r\ndepressed, with a viscid cuticle, growing pale. Margin thin, furrowed\r\nand tuberculate. Flesh white, sometimes yellowish above.\r\n\r\nThe stem is at first short and conical, then club-shaped or ventricose,\r\nsometimes three inches long and up to one inch thick; spongy, stuffed,\r\ncommonly striate; even, and shining white.\r\n\r\nThe gills are somewhat free, very broad, sometimes three-fourths of an\r\ninch; equal or bifid at the stem, rather distant and connected by veins;\r\npallid or white, at length light yellow, being powdered yellow with the\r\nspores.\r\n\r\nAlthough the taste is mild it is often astringent. One of the most\r\nchangeable of all species, especially in the color of the pileus, which,\r\nthough typically red, is often found inclining to azure-blue, bay-brown,\r\nolivaceous, etc. It occasionally happens that the gills are sterile and\r\nremain white. _Fries._\r\n\r\nThe spores are spheroid, spiny, pale ochraceous.\r\n\r\nR. integra so closely resembles R. alutacea that to distinguish them\r\nrequires a knowledge of both plants, and even then one may not feel\r\nquite sure; however, it matters little as they are equally good. Its\r\npowdery gills will help to distinguish R. integra from R. alutacea.\r\nFound from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Russula roseipes. (secr) Bres._\r\n\r\nTHE ROSY-STEMMED RUSSULA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 151.--Russula roseipes. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nRoseipes is from _rosa_, a rose; _pes_, a foot; so called because of its\r\nrose-colored or pinkish stem.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to three inches broad, convex, becoming nearly plane,\r\nor slightly depressed; at first viscid, soon dry, becoming slightly\r\nstriate on the margin; rosy-red variously modified by pink, orange or\r\nochraceous hues, sometimes becoming paler with age; taste mild.\r\n\r\nThe gills are moderately close, nearly entire, rounded behind and\r\nslightly adnexed, ventricose, whitish becoming yellow.\r\n\r\nThe stem is one to three inches long, slightly tapering upward, stuffed\r\nor somewhat cavernous, white tinged with red. The spores are yellow,\r\nround. _Peck_, 51 R.\r\n\r\nThis plant is widely distributed from Maine to the West. It grows best\r\nin pine and hemlock woods, but sometimes found in mixed woods. It is\r\nfound in July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Russula fragilis. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE TENDER RUSSULA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 152.--Russula fragilis.]\r\n\r\nFragilis means fragile.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is rather small, flesh-color or red, or reddish; thin, fleshy\r\nonly at the disk; at first convex and often umbonate, then plane,\r\ndepressed; cuticle thin, becoming pale, viscid in wet weather, margin\r\ntuberculate-striate.\r\n\r\nThe gills are thin, ventricose, white, slightly adnexed, equal, crowded,\r\nsometimes slightly eroded at the edge. The spores are minutely\r\nechinulate, 8-10×8µ.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stuffed, hollow, shining white.\r\n\r\nQuite as acrid as R. emetica, which it resembles in many ways,\r\nespecially the smaller plants. It can be distinguished by its thinner\r\ncaps, thinner and crowded gills, more ventricose and often slightly\r\neroded at the edge. It is generally classed among poisonous mushrooms;\r\nbut Captain Charles McIlvaine in his book says: \"Though one of the\r\npeppery kind, I have not, after fifteen years of eating it, had reason\r\nto question its edibility.\" I should advise caution. Eat of it sparingly\r\ntill sure of its effects. Found in woods from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Russula emetica. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE EMETIC RUSSULA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 153.--Russula emetica. Two-thirds natural size.\r\nCaps rose-red to yellow-red. Gills white.]\r\n\r\nEmetica means making sick, inciting to vomit. The pileus is fleshy,\r\nquite viscid, expanded, polished, shining, oval, or bell-shaped when\r\nyoung; its color is very variable from rose-red to a yellow-red or even\r\npurple; margin furrowed, flesh white.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free, equal, broad, distant, white. The spores are round,\r\n8µ.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stout, solid, though sometimes spongy stuffed, even, white\r\nor reddish. The spores are white, round, and spiny.\r\n\r\nThis species is recognized by its very acrid taste and free gills. A\r\ndistinct channel will be seen between the gills and the stem. This very\r\npretty mushroom is quite common in most parts of Ohio. I found it in\r\nabundance about Salem, Bowling Green, Sidney, and Chillicothe--all in\r\nthis state.\r\n\r\nCaptain McIlvaine states that he has repeatedly eaten it and cites a\r\nnumber of others who ate it without bad results, although weight of\r\nauthority would band it a reprobate. I am glad to report something in\r\nits favor, for it is a beautiful plant, yet I should advise caution in\r\nits use.\r\n\r\nIt is found in open woods or in pastures under trees, from July to\r\nOctober. Its viscid cap will distinguish it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Russula furcata. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE FORKED GILLED RUSSULA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 154.--Russula furcata. Two-thirds natural size.\r\nCaps greenish-umber to reddish.]\r\n\r\nFurca, a fork, so called from the forking of the gills. This is not\r\npeculiar, however, to this species. The pileus is two to three inches\r\nbroad; greenish, usually greenish-umber, sometimes reddish; fleshy;\r\ncompact; nearly round, then expanded, depressed in the center; even;\r\nsmooth; often sprinkled with a silky luster, pellicle separable, margin\r\nat first inflexed, then expanded, always even, sometimes turned upward.\r\nThe flesh is firm, white, dry, somewhat cheesy.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnate or slightly decurrent, somewhat crowded, broad,\r\nnarrowed at both ends, many forked, shining white. The spores, 7-8×9µ.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three inches long, solid, white, rather firm, even,\r\nequal or tapering downward. The spores are round and spiny.\r\n\r\nI have found it frequently on the wooded hillsides of the state. The\r\ntaste when raw is mild at first, but soon develops a slight bitterness\r\nwhich, however, is lost in cooking. Fried in butter they are excellent.\r\nJuly to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Russula rubra, Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE RED RUSSULA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 155.--Russula rubra. Two-thirds natural size. Caps\r\nbright-vermilion. Gills forked and tinged with red.]\r\n\r\nRubra means red, so called from the cap being concolorous, bright\r\nvermillion; showy, becoming pale with age, center of the cap usually\r\ndarker; compact, hard, fragile, convex, expanded, somewhat depressed,\r\ndry, no pellicle, often cracked when old. The flesh is white, often\r\nreddish under the cuticle.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnate, rather crowded, white at first, then yellowish,\r\nmany forked and with some short ones intermixed, frequently tinged with\r\nred at the edge. Spores 8-10µ, cystidia pointed.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three inches long, solid, even, white, often with a\r\nfaint reddish hue. The spores are nearly round and white.\r\n\r\nIt is very acrid to the taste, and because of this acridity it is\r\nusually thought to be poisonous, but Captain McIlvaine says he does not\r\nhesitate to cook it either by itself or with other Russulæ. It is found\r\nvery generally in the state and is quite plentiful in the woods about\r\nChillicothe, from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Russula purpurina. Quel & Schulz._\r\n\r\nTHE PURPLE RUSSULA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 156.--Russula purpurina. Two-thirds natural size.\r\nCaps rosy-pink to light-yellow. Gills yellowish in age.]\r\n\r\nPurpurina means purple. The pileus is fleshy, margin acute, subglobose,\r\nthen plane, at length depressed in the center, slightly viscid in wet\r\nweather, not striate, often split, pellicle separable, rosy-pink, paling\r\nto light-yellow.\r\n\r\nGills are crowded in youth, afterward subdistant, white, in age\r\nyellowish, reaching the stem, not greatly narrowed behind, almost equal,\r\nnot forked.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stuffed, spongy, very variable, cylindrical, attenuated\r\nabove, rosy-pink, becoming paler toward the base, color obscure in age.\r\nThe flesh is fragile, white, reddish under the skin; odor slight and\r\ntaste mild. The spores white, globose, sometimes subelliptical, 4-8µ\r\nlong, minutely warted. _Peck_, 42 Rept., N. Y. State Bot.\r\n\r\nThis is not a large plant, but it can be readily determined by its red\r\nor reddish stem, mild taste and white spores. Found in open woods in\r\nJuly and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Russula densifolia. Gillet._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 157.--Russula densifolia. Two-thirds natural size.\r\nCaps whitish, becoming fuliginous gray. Flesh turning red when exposed\r\nto the air.]\r\n\r\nDensifolia has reference to the crowded condition of the gills.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is from three to four inches broad, fleshy, quite compact,\r\nconvex, expanded, then depressed, margin inflexed, smooth, not striate,\r\nwhite or whitish, becoming fuliginous, gray, or brownish, quite black in\r\ncenter, flesh red when broken.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, somewhat decurrent, unequal, thin,\r\ncrowded, white or whitish, with a rosy tint. Spores, 7-8µ.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, slightly mealy, white, then gray, at length blackish,\r\nsmooth, round, turning red or brown on being handled.\r\n\r\nIt differs from _R. nigricans_ in being much smaller, and in its crowded\r\ngills. It differs from _R. adusta_ in flesh turning red when broken. The\r\nflesh or substance is white at first, turning red when exposed to the\r\nair, then blackish. This plant is not abundant in this state. I found a\r\nnumber of plants on Cemetery Hill, where some shale had been dumped\r\nunder a large beech tree. Found in July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cantharellus. Adanson._\r\n\r\nCantharellus means a diminutive drinking-cup or vase. This genus can be\r\ndistinguished from all other genera by the character of its gills which\r\nare quite blunt on the edge, like folds, polished, and are mostly forked\r\nor branched. In some species the gills vary in thickness and number.\r\nThey are decurrent, folded, more or less thick and swollen. The spores\r\nare white. They grow on the ground, on rotten wood, and among moss. They\r\nseem to delight in damp shady places.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cantharellus cibarius. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE EDIBLE CANTHARELLUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXII. Figure 158.--Cantharellus cibarius.\r\n\r\nNatural size. Entire plant egg-yellow.]\r\n\r\nCibarius means pertaining to food. This plant is frequently spoken of as\r\nthe Chanterelle. The entire plant is a rich egg-yellow. The pileus is\r\nfleshy, at first convex, later flat, three to five inches broad,\r\ndepressed in the center, finally funnel-shaped; bright to deep yellow;\r\nfirm, smooth, but often irregular, its margin often wavy; flesh white,\r\nthe cap has the appearance of an inverted cone.\r\n\r\nThe gills are decurrent, shallow and fluted, resembling swollen veins,\r\nbranched, more or less interconnected and tapering downward on the stem,\r\ncolor the same as the pileus.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, variable in length, often curved, tapering towards\r\nthe base, paler than the pileus and gills.\r\n\r\nIt grows in woods and rather open places. I found it in great abundance\r\nin Stanley's woods, near Damascus, Ohio. I have found it very often\r\nabout Chillicothe. The plant has a strong prune-like odor; when tasted\r\nraw they are peppery and pungent but sweet and quite delicious when\r\ncooked. My friends and myself have eaten it and pronounced very good.\r\nThe plants in Figure 158 were gathered near Columbus, Ohio, and\r\nphotographed by Dr. Kellerman.\r\n\r\nThe species is quite common in the state, and is found from June to\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cantharellus aurantiacus. Fr._\r\n\r\nFALSE CHANTARELLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 159.--Cantharellus aurantiacus. One-third natural size. Caps\r\norange-yellow. Gills yellow and forked.]\r\n\r\nAurantiacus means orange-yellow. The pileus is fleshy, soft, depressed,\r\ndowny, the margin strongly incurved when young, in mature plants it is\r\nwavy or lobed; color dull yellowish, usually brownish.\r\n\r\nThe gills are crowded, straight, dark-orange, branched, with a regular\r\nbifurcation.\r\n\r\nThe stem is lighter in color than the pileus, solid at first, spongy,\r\nstuffed, hollow, unequal, tapering upward, and somewhat curved.\r\n\r\nIt is generally labeled poisonous, but some good authorities say it is\r\nwholesome. I have never eaten it further than in its raw state. It is\r\neasily distinguished from the edible species by its dull orange cap and\r\nits orange gills, which are thinner and closer and more regularly forked\r\nthan those of the Edible Chantarelle. It grows in woods and open places.\r\nFound from July to September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cantharellus floccosus. Schw._\r\n\r\nTHE WOOLLY CANTHARELLUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate XXIII. Figure 160.--Cantharellus floccosus.]\r\n\r\nFloccosus means floccose or woolly.\r\n\r\nThe pileus at the top is from one to two inches broad, fleshy, elongated\r\nfunnel-form or trumpet-shape, floccose-squamose, ochraceous-yellow.\r\n\r\nThe gills are vein-like, close, much anastomosing above, long decurrent\r\nand subparallel below, concolorous.\r\n\r\nThe stem is very short, thick, rather deeply rooted. The spores are\r\nelliptical, 12.5-15×7.6µ. _Peck_, 23 Rep., N. Y.\r\n\r\nThis plant is funnel-shaped nearly to the base of the stem. It is a\r\nsmall plant, never more than four inches high. I found it in Haynes's\r\nHollow, in rather open woods, on mossy hillsides. July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cantharellus brevipes. Pk._\r\n\r\nThe Short-Stemmed Cantharellus. Edible.\r\n\r\nBrevipes is from _brevis_, short; _pes_, foot; so called because of its\r\nshort stem.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, obconic, glabrous, alutaceous, or dingy\r\ncream-color, the thin margin erect, often irregular and lobed, tinged\r\nwith lilac in the young plant; folds numerous, nearly straight in the\r\nmargin, abundantly anastomosing below; pale umber, tinged with lilac.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, tomentose-pubescent, ash-colored, solid, often\r\ntapering downward. Spores yellowish, oblong-elliptical, uninucleate,\r\n10-12×5µ. _Peck_, 33d Rep., N. Y.\r\n\r\nThe plant is small; with us, not more than three inches high and the\r\npileus not more than two inches broad at the top. It differs somewhat in\r\ncolor, in the character of the folds, and materially in the shape of the\r\nmargin of the pileus. Found occasionally on the hillsides of Huntington\r\nTownship, near Chillicothe, July to August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cantharellus cinnabarinus. Schw._\r\n\r\nTHE CINNABAR CANTHARELLUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 161.--Cantharellus cinnabarinus. Cap and stem\r\ncinnibar-red, flesh white. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nCinnabarinus means cinnabar-red, from the color of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is firm, convex, or slightly depressed in the center, often\r\nirregular with wavy or lobed margin; glabrous, cinnabar-red, flesh\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nThe gills are narrow, distant, branched, decurrent, of the same color as\r\nthe cap, dull on the edge.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal or tapering downward, glabrous, solid, sometimes\r\nstuffed, cinnabar-red.\r\n\r\nThe spores are elliptical, 8-10µ long, 4-5µ broad.\r\n\r\nNo one will have any difficulty in identifying this plant, since its\r\ncolor suggests the name at once. It is quite common about Chillicothe\r\nand throughout the state. It is found frequently with Craterellus\r\ncantharellus. It is a very pretty plant, growing in open woods or along\r\nthe roadside in woods. It will keep for some time after it is gathered.\r\nIt is found from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cantharellus infundibuliformis. Fr._\r\n\r\nFUNNEL-SHAPED CANTHARELLUS.\r\n\r\nInfundibuliformis means shaped like a funnel.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one to two and a half inches broad, somewhat\r\nmembranaceous, umbilicate, then infundibuliform, usually perforated at\r\nthe base, and opening into the cavity of the stem, floccosely rugose on\r\nthe surface, yellowish-gray or smoky when moist, pale when dry, becoming\r\nwavy.\r\n\r\nThe gills are decurrent, thick, distant, regularly forked, straight,\r\nyellow or cenereous, at length pruinose.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three inches long, hollow, even, smooth, always\r\nyellow, slightly thickened at the base. The spores are elliptical,\r\nsmooth, 9-10×6µ.\r\n\r\nThey grow on the ground, especially where wood has decayed and become a\r\npart of the ground. They also grow on decayed wood. They are found from\r\nJuly to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nyctalis. Fr._\r\n\r\nNyctalis is from a Greek word meaning night.\r\n\r\nPileus symmetrical, in some species bearing large conidia upon its\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnate or decurrent, thick, soft, margin obtuse.\r\n\r\nThe stem is central, its substance continuous with the flesh of the\r\npileus. The spores are colorless, smooth, elliptical or globose.\r\n_Fries._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nyctalis asterophora. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 162.--Nyctalis asterophora.]\r\n\r\nAsterophora means star-bearing.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is about one-half inch broad, fleshy; conical, then\r\nhemispherical; flocculose and rather mealy, owing to the large, stellate\r\nconidia; whitish, then tinged with fawn-color.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnate, distant, narrow, somewhat forked, straight, dingy.\r\n\r\nThe stem is about one-half inch long, slender, twisted, stuffed, white\r\nthen brownish, rather mealy. The spores are elliptical, smooth, 3×2µ.\r\n_Fries, Hym._\r\n\r\nI found, about the last of August, these plants growing on decaying\r\nspecimens of Russula nigricans, along Ralston's Run, near Chillicothe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygrophorus. Fr._\r\n\r\nHygrophorus is from two Greek words meaning bearing moisture. So called\r\nbecause the members of this genus may be known from their moist caps and\r\nthe waxy nature of the gills, which distinguish them from all others. As\r\nin the Pleurotus, the gills of some of the species are rounded or\r\nnotched at the end next to the stem, but of others they are decurrent on\r\nit; hence, in some species they are like the gills of Tricholoma in\r\ntheir attachment, in others they run down on the stem as in the\r\nClitocybe. In many of them both cap and stem are very viscid, a\r\ncharacteristic not found in the Clitocybes; and the gills are generally\r\nthicker and much farther apart than in that genus. A number of the\r\nspecies are beautifully colored.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygrophorus pratensis. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE PASTURE HYGROPHORUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXIV. Figure 163.--Hygrophorus pratensis.]\r\n\r\nPratensis, from pratum, a meadow. The pileus is one to two inches broad;\r\nwhen young almost hemispherical, then convex, turbinate or nearly flat,\r\nthe center more or less convex, as if umbonate; margin often cracked,\r\nfrequently contracted or lobed; white or various shades of yellow,\r\nbuffish-reddish, or brownish. Flesh white, thick in the center, thin at\r\nthe margin. The stem is stuffed, attenuated downwards. The gills are\r\nthick, distant, white or yellowish, bow-shaped, decurrent, and connected\r\nby vein-like folds. Spores are white, broadly elliptical, .00024 to\r\n.00028 inch long.\r\n\r\nThe pasture hygrophorus is a small but rather stout-appearing mushroom.\r\nIt grows on the ground in pastures, waste places, clearings, and thin\r\nwoods, from July to September. Sometimes all white or gray.\r\n\r\nVar. cinereus, Fr. Pileus and gills gray. The stem whitish and slender.\r\n\r\nVar. pallidus, B. & Br. Pileus depressed, edge wavy, entirely pale\r\nochre.\r\n\r\nThis species differs mainly from H. leporinus in that the latter is\r\nquite floccose on the pileus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygrophorus eburneus. Bull._\r\n\r\nSHINING WHITE HYGROPHORUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 164.--Hygrophorus eburneus.]\r\n\r\nEburneus is from _ebur_, ivory. The pileus is two to four inches broad,\r\nsometimes thin, sometimes somewhat compact, white; very viscid or\r\nglutinous in wet weather, and slippery to the touch; margin uneven,\r\nsometimes wavy; smooth, and shining. When young, the margin is incurved.\r\n\r\nThe gills are firm, distant, straight, strongly decurrent, with\r\nvein-like elevations near the stem. The spores are white, rather long.\r\n\r\nThe stem is unequal, sometimes long and sometimes short; stuffed, then\r\nhollow, tapering downward, punctate above with granular scales. Odor and\r\ntaste are rather pleasant. It is found in woods and pastures in all\r\nparts of Ohio, but it is not plentiful anywhere. I have found it only in\r\ndamp woods about Chillicothe. August to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygrophorus cossus. Sow._\r\n\r\nCossus, because it smells like the caterpillar, Cossus ligniperda.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is small, quite viscid, shining when dry, white with a yellow\r\ntinge, edge naked, very strong-scented.\r\n\r\nThe gills are somewhat decurrent, thin, distant, straight, firm.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stuffed, nearly equal, scurvy-punctate upwards. Spores 8×4.\r\nFound in the woods. The strong smell will serve to identify the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygrophorus chlorophanus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE GREENISH-YELLOW HYGROPHORUS.\r\n\r\nChlorophanus is from two Greek words, meaning appearing greenish-yellow.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one inch broad, commonly bright sulphur-yellow, sometimes\r\nscarlet-tinted, not changing color; slightly membranaceous, very\r\nfragile, often irregular, with the margin split or lobed, at first\r\nconvex, then expanded; smooth, viscid, margin striate.\r\n\r\nThe gills are emarginate, adnexed, quite ventricose, with a thin\r\ndecurrent tooth, thin, subdistant, distinct, pale-yellow.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three inches long, hollow, equal, round, viscid when\r\nmoist, shining when dry, wholly unicolorous, rich light-yellow.\r\n\r\nThe spores are slightly elliptical, 8×5µ.\r\n\r\nThis species resembles in appearance H. ceraceus, but it can be\r\nidentified by its emarginate gills and somewhat larger form. The plant\r\nhas a wide distribution, having been found from the New England States\r\nthrough the Middle West. It is found in damp, mossy places from August\r\nto October. I have no doubt of its edibility. It has a mild and\r\nagreeable taste when eaten in the raw state.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygrophorus cantharellus. Schw._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 165.--Hygrophorus cantharellus. Natural size. Caps\r\nbright red.]\r\n\r\nCantharellus means a small vase.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is thin, convex, at length umbilicate, or centrally\r\ndepressed, minutely squamulose, moist, bright red, becoming orange or\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\nThe gills are distant, subarcuate, decurrent, yellow, sometimes tinged\r\nwith vermilion.\r\n\r\nThe stem is one to three inches long, smooth, equal, sub-solid,\r\nsometimes becoming hollow, concolorous, whitish within. _Peck._\r\n\r\nI have found about Chillicothe a number of the varieties given by Dr.\r\nPeck.\r\n\r\nVar. flava.

Stem reddish or red.\r\n\r\nVar. rosea. Has the pileus expanded and margin wavy scalloped.\r\n\r\nFound from July to September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygrophorus coccineus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE SCARLET HYGROPHORUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nCoccineus, pertaining to scarlet. The pileus is thin, convex, obtuse,\r\nviscid, scarlet, growing pale, smooth, fragile.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, with a decurrent tooth, connected by\r\nveins, variously shaded.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow and compressed, rather even, not slippery, scarlet\r\nnear the cap, yellow at the base.\r\n\r\nThis plant when young is of a bright scarlet, but it soon shades into a\r\nlight-yellow with advancing age. It is quite fragile and varies very\r\ngreatly in size in different localities. Found in woods and pastures\r\nfrom July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygrophorus conicus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE CONICAL HYGROPHORUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 166.--Hygrophorus conicus.]\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one to two inches broad, acutely conical,\r\nsubmembranaceous, smooth, somewhat lobed, at length expanded, and\r\nrimose; turning black, as does the whole plant when broken or bruised;\r\norange, yellow, scarlet, brown, dusky.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free or adnexed, thick, attenuated, ventricose, yellowish\r\nwith frequently a cinereous tinge, wavy, rather crowded.\r\n\r\nThe stem is three to four inches long, hollow, cylindrical, fibrillose,\r\nstriated, colored like the pileus, turning black when handled.\r\n\r\nThis plant is quite fragile. It can be identified by its turning black\r\nwhen bruised. It sometimes appears early in the spring and continues\r\ntill late in the fall. It is not abundant but is only occasionally found\r\non the ground in woods and open places.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygrophorus flavodiscus. Frost._\r\n\r\nYELLOW-DISKED HYGROPHORUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 167.--Hygrophorus flavodiscus. Natural size. The\r\ngluten is shown connecting the margin of the cap to their stem.]\r\n\r\nFlavodiscus means yellow-disked.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one-half to three inches broad, fleshy, convex or nearly\r\nplane, glabrous, very viscid or glutinous, white, pale-yellow or\r\nreddish-yellow in the center, flesh white.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnate or decurrent, subdistant, white, sometimes with a\r\nslight flesh-colored tint, the interspaces sometimes venose.\r\n\r\nThe stem is one to three inches long, solid, subequal, very viscid, or\r\nglutinous, white at the top, white or yellowish elsewhere. The spores\r\nare elliptical, white, .00025 to .0003 of an inch long, .00016 to .0002\r\nbroad.\r\n\r\nThese mushrooms make a delicious dish. The specimens in the photograph\r\nwere gathered at West Gloucester, Mass., by Mrs. E. B. Blackford, of\r\nBoston. I have found them about Chillicothe. They are very viscid, as\r\nthe plants in Figure 167 will show. The caps are thick and the margin\r\ninrolled. They are found in October and November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygrophorus speciosus. Pk._\r\n\r\nSHOWY HYGROPHORUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 168.--Hygrophorus speciosus.]\r\n\r\nSpeciosus means beautiful, showy; so called from the scarlet color of\r\nthe umbo. The pileus is one to two inches in diameter, broadly convex,\r\noften with small central umbo; glabrous, very viscid or glutinous when\r\nmoist; yellow, usually bright red or scarlet in the center; flesh white,\r\nyellow under the thin, separable pellicle.\r\n\r\nThe gills are distant, decurrent, white, or slightly tinged with yellow.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to four inches long, nearly equal, solid, viscid,\r\nslightly fibrillose, whitish or yellowish. The spores are elliptic,\r\n.0003 of an inch long, .0002 broad. _Peck._\r\n\r\nThis is a very beautiful and showy plant. It grows in swampy places and\r\nunder tamarack trees. The specimens in Figure 168 were found in\r\nMassachusetts by Mrs. Blackford, and were photographed by Dr. Kellerman.\r\nIt is found in September and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygrophorus fuligineus. Frost._\r\n\r\nSOOTY HYGROPHORUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 169.--Hygrophorus fuligineus. Natural size.\r\nSpecimen on the right is H. caprinus.]\r\n\r\nFuligineus means sooty or smoky.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one to four inches broad, convex or nearly plane,\r\nglabrous, very viscid or glutinous, grayish-brown or fuliginous, the\r\ndisk often darker or almost black.\r\n\r\nThe gills are subdistant, adnate or decurrent, white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to four inches long, solid, viscid or glutinous, white\r\nor whitish. The spores are elliptic, .0003 to .00035 of an inch long,\r\n.0002 broad. _Peck_, No. 4, Vol. 3.\r\n\r\nThis species is found frequently associated with H. flavodiscus, which\r\nit resembles very closely, save in color. When moist, the cap and stems\r\nare covered with a thick coating of gluten, and when the caps are dry\r\nthis gives them a varnished appearance. I do not find them abundant\r\nhere. The plants in Figure 169 were found by Mrs. Blackford near West\r\nGloucester, Mass. They are found October and November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygrophorus caprinus. Scop._\r\n\r\nTHE GOAT HYGROPHORUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nCaprinus means belonging to a goat; it is so called from the fibrils\r\nresembling goat's hair.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to three inches broad, fleshy, fragile, conical, then\r\nflattened and umbonate, rather wavy, sooty, fibrillose.\r\n\r\nThe gills are very broad, quite distant, deeply decurrent, white, then\r\nglaucous.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to four inches long, solid, fibrillose, sooty, often\r\nstreaked or striate, as will be seen in Figure 169, page 212.\r\n\r\nThe spores are 10×7-8µ.\r\n\r\nThese plants grow in pine woods in company with H. fuligineus and H.\r\nflavodiscus. The specimen on the right in Figure 169 was found near West\r\nGloucester, Mass., by Mrs. Blackford. It is found from September till\r\nhard frost.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygrophorus Lauræ. Morg._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 170.--Hygrophorus Lauræ.]\r\n\r\nThis is a beautiful plant, found among leaves, and so completely covered\r\nwith particles of leaves and soil that it is hard to clean them off.\r\nThey are very viscid, both stem and cap. They are only occasionally\r\nfound in our state.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to three inches broad; reddish-brown in the center,\r\nshading to a very light tan on the edges; very viscid; convex; margin at\r\nfirst slightly incurved, then expanded.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnate, slightly decurrent, not crowded, unequal,\r\nyellowish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stuffed, tapering downward, whitish, furfuraceous near the\r\ncap.\r\n\r\nI have found this plant in Poke Hollow, near Chillicothe, on several\r\noccasions, also in Gallia county, Ohio. I have not found it elsewhere in\r\nthis vicinity. While I have not found it in sufficient quantity to try\r\nit I have no doubt of its edible qualities. I have found it only about\r\nthe last of September and the first of October. It grows in rather dense\r\nwoods on the north sides of the hills, where it is constantly shaded and\r\ndamp. Named in honor of Prof. Morgan's wife.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygrophorus micropus. Pk._\r\n\r\nSHORT-STEMMED HYGROPHORUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nMicropus means short-stemmed. The pileus is thin, fragile, convex or\r\ncentrally depressed, umbilicate; silky, gray, often with one or two\r\nnarrow zones on the margin; taste and odor farinaceous.\r\n\r\nThe gills are narrow, close, adnate or slightly decurrent, gray,\r\nbecoming salmon color with age.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, solid or with a slight cavity, often slightly\r\nthickened at the top, pruinose, gray, with a white, mycelioid tomentum\r\nat the base. The spores are angular, uninucleate, salmon color,\r\n.0003--.0004 of an inch long, .00025--.0003 broad. _Peck._\r\n\r\nThis is a very small plant and not frequently found, but widely\r\ndistributed. I have always found it in open grassy places during damp\r\nweather. The caps are thin, often markedly depressed. Its silky\r\nappearance and narrow zones on the margin of the cap, together with its\r\nrather close gills, broadly attached to the stem, gray at first, then\r\nsalmon color, will identify the species. July to September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygrophorus miniatus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE VERMILION HYGROPHORUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 171.--Hygrophorus miniatus. Cap and stems\r\nvermilion-red. Gills yellowish and tinged with bright-red.]\r\n\r\nMiniatus is from minium, red lead.\r\n\r\nThis is a small but a very common species, highly colored and very\r\nattractive. The pileus and the stem are bright red and often vermilion.\r\nThe pileus is at first convex, but, when fully expanded, it is nearly or\r\nquite flat, and in wet weather it is even concave by the elevation of\r\nthe margin, smooth or minutely scaly, often umbilicate. Its color varies\r\nfrom a bright red or vermilion or blood-red to pale orange hues.\r\n\r\nThe gills are yellow and frequently strongly tinged with red, distant,\r\nattached to the stem, and sometimes notched.\r\n\r\nThe stem is usually short and slender, colored like, or a little paler,\r\nthan the cap; solid, when young, but becoming stuffed or hollow with\r\nage. The spores are elliptical, white, 8µ long.\r\n\r\nThe Vermilion mushroom grows in woods and in open fields. It is more\r\nplentiful in wet weather. It seems to grow best where chestnut logs have\r\ndecayed. It can be found in such places in sufficient quantities to eat.\r\nFew mushrooms are more tender or have a more delicate flavor. There are\r\ntwo other species having red caps, Hygrophorus coccineus and H.\r\npuniceus, but both are edible and no harm could come from any mistake.\r\nThey are found from June to October. Those in Figure 171 were found in\r\nPoke Hollow September 29.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygrophorus miniatus sphagnophilus. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXV. Figure 172.--Hygrophorus miniatus\r\nsphagnophilus.\r\n\r\nNatural size.]\r\n\r\nSphagnophilus means sphagnum-loving, so called because it is found\r\ngrowing on sphagnum.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is broadly convex, subumbilicate, red.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnate, whitish, becoming yellowish or sometimes tinged\r\nwith red, occasionally red on the edge.\r\n\r\nThe stem is colored like the pileus, whitish at the base, both it and\r\nthe pileus are very fragile.\r\n\r\nThis is more fragile than the typical form and retains its color better\r\nin drying. _Peck_, 43d Rep.\r\n\r\nThis is a beautiful plant growing, as Figure 172 shows, on the lower\r\ndead portion of the stems of bog moss or sphagnum. It grows very\r\nabundantly in Buckeye Lake. The photograph was made by Dr. Kellerman. It\r\nis found from July to October. These plants cook readily, have an\r\nexcellent flavor and because of their color make an inviting dish. I\r\nhave eaten heartily of them several times.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygrophorus marginatus. Pk._\r\n\r\nMARGINED HYGROPHORUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 173.--Hygrophorus marginatus.]\r\n\r\nMarginatus, so called from the frequent vermilion edged gills.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is thin, fragile, convex, subcampanulate or nearly plane,\r\noften irregular, sometimes broadly umbonate, glabrous, shining,\r\nstriatulate on the margin, bright golden-yellow.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rather broad, subdistant, ventricose, emarginate, adnexed,\r\nyellow, sometimes becoming orange or vermilion on the edge, interspaces\r\nvenose.\r\n\r\nThe stem is fragile, glabrous, often flexous, compressed or irregular,\r\nhollow, pale-yellow; spores broadly elliptic, .00024--.0003 of an inch\r\nlong, .00024--.0002 broad. _Peck_, N. Y., 1906.\r\n\r\nThis plant has the most beautiful yellow I have ever seen in a mushroom.\r\nThis bright golden yellow and the orange or vermilion color on the\r\nmargin or edge of the gills will always characterize the plant.\r\n\r\nThe specimen in Figure 173 were sent to me by Mrs. Blackford, of Boston,\r\nMass., the last of August. They were not in the best condition when\r\nphotographed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygrophorus ceraceus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE WAX-LIKE HYGROPHORUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 174.--Hygrophorus ceraceus. Caps waxy yellow.]\r\n\r\nCeraceus is from _cera_, wax. The pileus is one inch and less broad,\r\nwaxy-yellow, shining, fragile, thin, occasionally subumbonate, slightly\r\nfleshy, slightly striate.\r\n\r\nThe gills are firmly attached to the stem, subdecurrent, distant, broad,\r\nventricose often connected with veins, almost triangular, yellow.\r\n\r\nThe stem is one to two inches long, hollow, often unequal, flexuous,\r\nsometimes compressed, yellow, occasionally orange at the base, waxy. The\r\nspores 8×6µ.\r\n\r\nThis is a very beautiful, fragile plant, usually found growing in the\r\ngrass. It is easily distinguished by its waxy yellow color. The plants\r\nphotographed were found on the Cemetery Hill. They are found from August\r\nto October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygrophorus virgineus. Wulf._\r\n\r\nTHE IVORY-CAPPED HYGROPHORUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 175.--Hygrophorus virgineus. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize. Entire plant white.]\r\n\r\nVirgineus, virgin; so called from its whiteness. The pileus is fleshy,\r\nconvex, then plane, obtuse, at length depressed; moist, sometimes\r\ncracked into patches, floccose when dry.\r\n\r\nThe gills are decurrent, distant, rather thick, often forked.\r\n\r\nThe stem is curt, stuffed, firm, attenuated at the base, externally\r\nbecoming even and naked. Spores 12×5-6µ. _Fries._\r\n\r\nThe plant is wholly white and never large. It is easily confounded with\r\nH. niveus and sometimes difficult to distinguish from the white forms of\r\nH. pratensis. This plant is quite common in pastures, both in the spring\r\nand in the fall. I found the specimens in Figure 175 on Cemetery Hill\r\nunder the pine trees on November 11. They were photographed by Dr.\r\nKellerman.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygrophorus niveus._\r\n\r\nTHE SNOW-WHITE HYGROPHORUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nNiveus, snow-white. The plant is wholly white. The pileus is scarcely\r\none inch broad, somewhat membranaceous, bell-shaped, convex, then\r\numbilicate, smooth, striate, viscid when moist, not cracked when dry,\r\nflesh thin, everywhere equal.\r\n\r\nThe gills are decurrent, thin, distant, acute, quite entire.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow, thin, equal, smooth. Spores 7×4µ. Found in pastures.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygrophorus sordidus. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE DINGY HYGROPHORUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 176.--Hygrophorus sordidus.]\r\n\r\nSordidus means a dirty white, or dingy, referring to the color of the\r\ncaps, so made by adhering earth.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is broadly convex or nearly plane, glabrous, slightly viscid,\r\nwhite, but usually defiled by adhering dirt; the margin at first\r\nstrongly involute, then spreading or reflexed; flesh firm when young,\r\ntough when old.\r\n\r\nThe gills are subdistant, adnate, or decurrent, white or creamy-white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is five to ten Cm. long, firm, solid, white.\r\n\r\nThe spores are elliptical, 6.5-7.5×4-5µ. _Peck._\r\n\r\nThe specimens I found were clear white, growing among leaves and were\r\nespecially free from soil. The stems were short and were inclined to be\r\nslightly ventricose. Dr. Peck says that this \"species is distinguished\r\nfrom H. penarius by its clear white color, though this is commonly\r\nobscured by the adhering dirt that is carried up in the growth of the\r\nfungus.\" The young, growing plants were strongly involute but the older\r\nplants were reflexed, giving the plants a funnel-shaped appearance and\r\ngiving the gills a much stronger decurrent appearance. Found October\r\n26th.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hygrophorus serotinus. Pk._\r\n\r\nLATE HYGROPHORUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 177.--Hygrophorus serotinus.]\r\n\r\nSerotinus means late. So called because it is late in the season.\r\n\r\nPileus is fleshy but thin, convex or nearly plane, often with the thin\r\nmargin curved upward, glabrous or with a few obscure innate fibrils,\r\nreddish in the center, whitish on the margin, flesh white, taste mild.\r\n\r\nThe gills are thin, subdistant, adnate or decurrent, white, the\r\ninterspaces slightly venose.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal, stuffed or hollow, glabrous, whitish. The spores are\r\nwhite, elliptic, .0003 of an inch long, .0002 broad.\r\n\r\nPileus is 8-15 lines broad; stem about 1 inch long, 1.5-2.5 lines\r\nthick. _Peck._\r\n\r\nSome specimens of this species were sent to me from Boston by Mrs.\r\nBlackford, but after a careful study of them I was unable to place them.\r\nShe then sent them to Dr. Peck, who gave them their very appropriate\r\nname. Those in Figure 177 were sent me in December, 1907.\r\n\r\nThey grow a number in the same locality and frequently in close groups\r\nor tufts. They seem to delight in oak and pine woods. Dr. Peck observes\r\nthat this species is similar to Hygrophorus queletii, Bres., both in\r\nsize and color, but the general characteristics of the plants do not\r\nagree. He also says it is similar in size and color to H. subrufescens,\r\nPk., but differs materially in the specific description.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Panus. Fr._\r\n\r\nPanus means swelling. The species under this genus are leathery plants,\r\nhaving the stems lateral and sometimes wanting. They dry up but revive\r\nwith moisture. The gills are simple and thinner than the Lentinus, but\r\nwith an entire, acute edge. There are a few species which give a\r\nphosphorescent light when growing on decayed logs. The genus closely\r\nresembles Lentinus but can be readily recognized on account of the\r\nsmooth edged gills. A number of good authorities do not separate them\r\nbut give both under the name Lentinus. This genus abounds wherever there\r\nare stumps and fallen timber.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Panus stypticus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE STYPTIC PANUS. POISONOUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 178.--Panus stypticus. Two-thirds natural size. Cinnamon color.]\r\n\r\nStypticus means astringent, styptic. The pileus is coriaceous,\r\nkidney-shaped, cinnamon-color, growing pale, cuticle breaking up into\r\nscales, margin entire or lobed, surface nearly even, sometimes zoned.\r\n\r\nThe gills are thin, crowded, connected by veins, of same color as cap,\r\ndeterminate, quite narrow.\r\n\r\nThe stem is lateral, quite short, swollen above, solid, compressed,\r\npruinose, paler than the gills.\r\n\r\nIt is found very plentifully on decayed logs and stumps, and at times it\r\nis quite phosphorescent in its manifestations. It has an extremely\r\nunpleasant astringent taste. One might as well eat an Indian turnip as\r\nthis species. Just a taste will betray it. Found from fall to winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Panus strigosus. B. & C._\r\n\r\nTHE HAIRY PANUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nStrigosus, covered with stiff hairs. The pileus is sometimes quite\r\nlarge, eccentric, covered with stiff hairs, margin thin, white.\r\n\r\nThe gills are broad, distant, decurrent, straw-color.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stout, two to four inches long, hairy like the pileus.\r\n\r\nThe favorite host of this species is an apple tree. I found a beautiful\r\ncluster on an apple tree in Chillicothe. Its creamy whiteness and hairy\r\ncap and short hairy stem will distinguish it from all other tree fungi.\r\nIt is edible when young, but soon becomes woody.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Panus conchatus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE SHELL PANUS.\r\n\r\nConchatus means shell-shaped. The pileus is thin, unequal, tough,\r\nfleshy, eccentric, dimidiate; cinnamon, then pale; becoming scaly;\r\nflaccid; margin often lobed.\r\n\r\nThe gills are narrow, forming decurrent lines on the stem, often\r\nbranched, pinkish, then ochre.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, unequal, solid, rather pale, base downy.\r\n\r\nThis species will frequently be found imbricated and very generally\r\nconfluent. Its shell-like form, its tough substance, and its thin pileus\r\nare its distinguishing marks. The taste is pleasant but its substance\r\nvery tough. Found from September to frost.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Panus rudis. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 179.--Panus rudis.]\r\n\r\nThis is a very plentiful plant about Chillicothe and is found throughout\r\nthe United States, although it is a rare plant in Europe. It is\r\ngenerally given in American Mycology under the name Lentinus Lecomtei.\r\nIt grows on logs and stumps. The form of the plant is quite different\r\nwhen growing on the top of a log or a stump, from those springing from\r\nthe side. Those in the extreme left of Figure 179 grew on the side of\r\nthe log, while those in the center grew on the top, in which case the\r\nplant has usually a funnel-shaped appearance.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is tough, reddish or reddish-brown, depressed, sinuate,\r\nbristling with tufts of hair, the margin quite strongly incurved,\r\ncæspitose.\r\n\r\nThe gills are narrow and crowded, decurrent, considerably paler than the\r\ncap.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, hairy, tawny; sometimes the stem is almost obsolete.\r\n\r\nThere is a slight tinge of bitterness in the plant when raw, but in\r\ncooking this disappears. When prepared for food it should be chopped\r\nfine and well cooked. It can be dried for winter use. It is found from\r\nspring to late fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Panus torulosus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE TWISTED PANUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 180.--Panus torulosus.]\r\n\r\nTorulosus means a tuft of hair. The pileus is two to three inches broad,\r\nfleshy, then tough, coriaceous; plane, then funnel-shaped, or dimidiate;\r\neven; smooth; almost flesh color, varying to reddish-livid, sometimes\r\nviolet tinted.\r\n\r\nThe gills are decurrent, rather distant, distinct behind, separate,\r\nsimple, ruddy, then tan-colored.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, stout, oblique, gray, covered with a violaceous down.\r\nThe spores are 6×3µ.\r\n\r\nThe plant is variable both in form and color. Sometimes shaded very\r\nslightly with pink. It is not very common here. I found some very fine\r\nspecimens growing on a log near Spider Bridge, Chillicothe.\r\n\r\nIt is edible but quite tough.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Panus levis. B. & C._\r\n\r\nTHE LIGHT PANUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nLevis, light. Pileus two to three inches broad, orbicular, somewhat\r\ndepressed, white, covered with a dense mat of hair; margin inflexed and\r\nmarked by triangular ridges.\r\n\r\nThe gills are broad, entire, decurrent.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three inches long, attenuated upward, eccentric,\r\nlateral, solid, hairy below like the pileus. The spores are white.\r\n\r\nThis certainly is a very beautiful plant and will hold the attention of\r\nthe collector. It is not common with us. I have found it only on hickory\r\nlogs. It is said to be of good flavor and to cook readily.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lentinus. Fr._\r\n\r\nLentinus means tough. The pileus is fleshy, corky, tough, hard and dry,\r\nreviving when moist.\r\n\r\nThe stem is central or lateral and often wanting, but when present is\r\ncontinuous with the cap.\r\n\r\nThe gills are tough, unequal, thin, normally toothed, decurrent more or\r\nless, margin acute. The spores are smooth, white, orbicular.\r\n\r\nAll the species, so far as I know, grow on wood. They assume a great\r\nvariety of forms. This genus is very closely related to Panus in the\r\ndry, coriaceous nature of the pileus and the gills, but it can be\r\nreadily recognized by the toothed margin of the gills.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lentinus vulpinus. Fr._\r\n\r\nSTRONG-SCENTED VULPINUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXVI. Figure 181.--Lentinus vulpinus.\r\n\r\nOne-third natural size.]\r\n\r\nVulpinus is from _vulpes_, a fox.\r\n\r\nThis is quite a large, massive plant, growing in a sessile and\r\nimbricated manner. It has appeared in large quantities for the past four\r\nyears on an elm, very slightly decayed, but in quite a damp and dark\r\nplace. The reader will get some idea of the size of the whole plant in\r\nFigure 181 if he will consider each pileus to be five to six inches\r\nbroad. They are built up one on top of another, overlapping each other\r\nlike shingles on a roof.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy but tough, shell-shaped, connate behind,\r\nlongitudinally rough, costate, corrugate, tan-colored, and the margin is\r\nstrongly incurved.\r\n\r\nThe gills are broad, nearly white, flesh-colored near the base, coarsely\r\ntoothed.\r\n\r\nThe stem is usually obsolete, yet in some cases it is apparent.\r\n\r\nThe spores are almost round and very small, .00006 inch in diameter. In\r\nall plants which I have found the odor is somewhat strong and the taste\r\nis pungent. It grows in the woods in September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lentinus lepideus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE SCALY LENTINUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 182.--Lentinus lepideus.]\r\n\r\nLepideus is from _lepis_, a scale.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, compact, convex, then depressed, unequal, broken\r\nup in dark scales, flesh white, tough.\r\n\r\nThe gills are sinuate, decurrent, broad, torn, transversely striate,\r\nwhitish, or with white edges, irregularly toothed.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stout, central or lateral, tomentose or scaly, often\r\ncrooked, rooting, whitish, solid, equal or tapering at the base.\r\n\r\nThis is a peculiar plant, growing sometimes to immense forms. It grows\r\non wood, seemingly to be partial to railroad ties to which its mycelium\r\nis very injurious. I found the plant frequently about Salem, Ohio. The\r\nspecimens in the halftone were found near Akron, Ohio, and photographed\r\nby Prof. Smith. As an esculent it almost rivals the Pleuroti. It is\r\nfound from spring to autumn. I found a beautiful cluster on an oak stump\r\nnear Chillicothe, while looking for Morels, about the last of April.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lentinus cochleatus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE SPIRAL-FORMED LENTINUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 183.--Lentinus cochleatus.]\r\n\r\nCochleatus is from _cochlea_, a snail, from resembling its shell.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to three inches broad, tough, flaccid, irregular,\r\ndepressed, sometimes funnel-shaped, sometimes lobed or contorted,\r\nflesh-color, becoming pale.\r\n\r\nThe gills are crowded, beautifully serrated, pinkish-white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, length variable, sometimes central, frequently\r\neccentric, often lateral, smooth. The spores are nearly round, 4µ.\r\n\r\nThis is a beautiful plant but sparingly found with us. I found a\r\npretty cluster at the foot of a maple stump in Poke Hollow. The serrated\r\nform of the gills will attract attention at once. It is found in August\r\nand September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lenzites. Fr._\r\n\r\nLenzites, named after Lenz, a German botanist. The pileus is corky,\r\ndimidiate, sessile. The gills are corky, firm, unequal, branched, edge\r\nobtuse. It is very common in the woods, sometimes almost covering stumps\r\nand logs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lenzites betulina. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate XXVII. Figure 184.--Lenzites betulina.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 185.--Lenzites betulina.]\r\n\r\nBetulina, from _betula_, a birch. This has a somewhat corky, leathery\r\ncap, firm and without zones, woolly, sessile, deeply grooved\r\nconcentrically, margin of the same color.\r\n\r\nThe gills are radial, somewhat branching, and coming together again,\r\nsordid white or tan-color.\r\n\r\nThis species is wide-spread and is quite variable. It grows in the form\r\nof brackets. Figure 185 was photographed by Dr. Kellerman.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lenzites separia. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE CHOCOLATE LENZITES.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is corky, leathery shells, with the upper surface marked with\r\nrough zones of various shades of brown; margin yellowish.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rather thick, branched, one running into another;\r\nyellowish. Stem obsolete. Growing on limbs and branches, especially of\r\nthe fir tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lenzites flaccida. Fr._\r\n\r\nFLACCID LENZITES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 186.--Lenzites flaccida. Two-thirds natural size.]\r\n\r\nFlaccida means limp, flaccid. Pileus is coriaceous, thin, flaccid,\r\nunequal, hairy, zoned, pallid, more or less flabelliform, imbricated.\r\n\r\nThe gills are broad, crowded, straight, unequal, branched, white,\r\nbecoming pallid. Spores are 5×7.\r\n\r\nThis is a very attractive plant and quite common. It runs almost\r\nimperceptibly into Lenzites betulina. It is found on stumps and trunks.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lenzites vialis. Pk._\r\n\r\nPileus is corky, almost woody, firm, zoned.\r\n\r\nGills are thick, firm, serpentine.\r\n\r\nStem, none.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Schizophyllum. Fr._\r\n\r\nSchizophyllum is from two Greek words, meaning to split, and a leaf.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy and arid. The gills are corky, fan-like, branched,\r\nunited above by the tomentose pellicle, bifid, split longitudinally at\r\nthe edge. The spores somewhat round and white.\r\n\r\nThe two lips of the split edge of the gills are commonly revolute. This\r\ngenus is far removed from the type of Agaricini. It grows on wood and is\r\nvery common. _Stevenson._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Schizophyllum commune. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 187.--Schizophyllum commune.]\r\n\r\nThis is a very common plant, growing in the woods on branches and\r\ndecayed wood, where it can be found in both winter and summer.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is thin, adnate behind, somewhat extended, more or less\r\nfan-shaped or kidney-shaped, simple, often much lobed, narrowed behind\r\nto the point of attachment; whitish, downy, then strigose.\r\n\r\nThe gills are radiating, gray, then brownish-purple, and sometimes\r\nwhite, branched, split along the edges and rather deeply rolled\r\nbackwards. The spores are nearly round, 5-6µ.\r\n\r\nThis is a very common species all over the world. I found it in the\r\nwinter of 1907 on decayed shade-trees along the streets of Chillicothe.\r\nIt seems to be partial to maple timber. Some call this S. alneum. It is\r\nvery easily identified from its purple gills being split.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trogia. Fr._\r\n\r\nTrogia is so called in honor of the Swiss botanist, Trog.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is nearly membranaceous, soft, quite tough, flaccid, dry,\r\nflexible, fibrillose, reviving when moist.\r\n\r\nThe gills are fold-like, venose, narrow, irregular, crisped.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trogia crispa. Fr._\r\n\r\nCrispa means crisp or curled. The pileus tough, cup-shaped, reflexed,\r\nlobed, villous, whitish or reddish toward the attachment, often\r\ntan-colored.\r\n\r\nThe gills are quite narrow, vein-like, irregular, more or less branched,\r\nblunt on the edge, white or bluish-gray, quite crisped, edge not\r\nchanneled.\r\n\r\nThe caps are usually very much crowded and imbricated. It revives during\r\nwet weather and is found throughout the year, generally on beech limbs\r\nin our woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE ROSY-SPORED AGARICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spores of this series are of great variety of color, including rosy,\r\npink, salmon-color, flesh-color, or reddish. In Pluteus, Volvaria, and\r\nmost of Clitopilus, the spores are regular in shape, as in the\r\nwhite-spored series; in the other genera they are generally irregular\r\nand angular. There are not so many genera as in the other series and\r\nfewer edible species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pluteus. Fr._\r\n\r\nPluteus means a shed, referring to the sheds used to make a cover for\r\nbesiegers at their work, that they might be screened from the missiles\r\nof the enemy.\r\n\r\nThey have no volva, no ring on the stem. Gills are free from the stem,\r\nwhite at first then flesh-color.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pluteus cervinus. Schæff._\r\n\r\nFAWN-COLORED PLUTEUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate XXVIII. Figure 188.--Pluteus cervinus.\r\n\r\nNatural size.]\r\n\r\n_Cervinus is from cervus, a deer._ The pileus is fleshy, bell-shaped,\r\nexpanded, viscid in wet weather, smooth, except a few radiating fibrils\r\nwhen young, margin entire, flesh soft and white; color of the cap\r\nlight-brown or fawn-color, sometimes sooty, often more than three inches\r\nacross the cap.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free from the stem, broad, ventricose, unequal in length,\r\nalmost white when young, flesh-colored when mature from the falling of\r\nthe spores. The stem is solid, slightly tapering upward, firm, brittle,\r\nwhite, spread over with a few dark fibrils, generally crooked. The\r\nspores are broadly elliptical. The cystidia in the hymenium on the gills\r\nwill be of interest to those who have a microscope.\r\n\r\nThis is a very common mushroom about Chillicothe. It is found on logs,\r\nstumps, and especially on old sawdust piles. Note how easily the stem is\r\nremoved from the cap. This will distinguish it from the genus Entoloma.\r\nYou cannot get anything in the market that will make a better fry than\r\nPluteus cervinus; fried in butter, it is simply delicious. Found from\r\nMay to October.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 189.--Pluteus cervinus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pluteus granularis. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 190.--Pluteus granularis.]\r\n\r\nPileus is convex, then expanded, slightly umbonate, wrinkled, sprinkled\r\nwith minute blackish granules, varying in color from yellow to brown.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rather broad, close, ventricose, free, whitish, then\r\nflesh-colored.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal, solid, pallid, or brown, usually paler at the top,\r\nvelvety with a short, close pile.\r\n\r\nThe spores are subglobose, about .0002 inch in diameter. The plant is\r\ntwo to three inches high, pileus one to two inches broad, stem one to\r\ntwo lines thick. _Peck_, 38th Rep. N. Y. State Bot.\r\n\r\nThis is a much smaller species than P. cervinus, but its esculent\r\nqualities are quite as good. Found from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pluteus eximius. Smith._\r\n\r\n_Eximius, choice, distinguished._ The pileus is fleshy, bell-shaped when\r\nyoung, expanded, beautifully fringed on the margin, larger than the\r\ncervinus.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free, broad, ventricose, white at first, then\r\nrose-colored, flesh white, and firm.\r\n\r\nThe stem is thick, solid, and clothed with fibers. Dr. Herbst, Fungal\r\nFlora of the Lehigh Valley.\r\n\r\nI found some beautiful specimens in George Mosher's icehouse. I am very\r\nsorry I did not photograph them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Volvaria. Fr._\r\n\r\nThe spores of this genus are regular, oval, rosy-spored. The veil is\r\nuniversal, forming a perfect volva, distinct from the cuticle of the\r\npileus. The stem is easily separable from the pileus. The gills are\r\nfree, rounded behind, at first white, then pink, soft. Most of the\r\nspecies grow on wood. Some on damp ground, rich mold, in gardens, and in\r\nhot-houses. One is a parasite on Clitocybe nebularis and monadelphus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Volvaria bombycina. (Pers.) Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE SILKY VOLVARIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXIX. Figure 191.--Volvaria bombycina.\r\n\r\nThe egg form of the V. bombycina showing the universal veil or volva\r\nbursting at the apex. These are unusually large specimens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 192.--Volvaria bombycina. Two-thirds natural size.\r\nEntire plant white and silky.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 193.--Volvaria bombycina. Two-thirds natural size,\r\nshowing the gills, which are pink, then dark-brown.]\r\n\r\nBombycina is from _bombyx_, _silk_. This plant is so called because of\r\nthe beautiful silky lustre of the entire plant. The pileus is three to\r\neight inches broad, globose, then bell-shaped, finally convex and\r\nsomewhat umbonate, white, the entire surface silky, in older specimens\r\nmore or less scaly, sometimes smooth at the apex. The flesh is white\r\nand not thick.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free, very crowded, broad, ventricose, flesh-colored, not\r\nreaching the margin, toothed. The stem is three to six inches long,\r\ntapering upward, solid, smooth, the tough volva remaining like a cup at\r\nthe base. The spores are rosy in mass, smooth, and elliptical. The volva\r\nis large, membranaceous, somewhat viscid.\r\n\r\nThe plant in Figure 192 was found August 16th, on a maple tree where a\r\nlimb had been broken, on North High Street, Chillicothe. Many people had\r\npassed along and enjoyed the shade of the trees but its discovery\r\nremained for Miss Marian Franklin, whose eyes are trained to see birds,\r\nflowers, and everything beautiful in nature.\r\n\r\nI have found the plant frequently about Chillicothe, usually solitary;\r\nbut on one occasion I found three specimens upon one trunk, apparently\r\ngrowing from the same mycelial mass. The caps of two of them were each\r\nfive inches across. It usually grows on maple and beech. If you will\r\nobserve a hollow beech, or sugar snag of which one side is broken away,\r\nleaving the sheltered yet open nestling place, you are very likely to\r\nfind snugly enscounced in its decaying heart one or more specimens of\r\nthese beautiful silky plants. The volva is quite thick and frequently\r\nthe plant, when in the egg state, has the appearance of a phalloid.\r\nFound from June to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Volvaria umbonata. Peck._\r\n\r\nTHE UMBONATE VOLVARIA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 194.--Volvaria umbonata. Two-thirds natural size.\r\nEntire plant white and silky.]\r\n\r\nUmbonata, having an umbo or conical projection like the boss of a\r\nshield. This plant is quite common on the richly manured lawns of\r\nChillicothe. I have found it from June to October. The pileus is white\r\nor whitish, sometimes grayish, often smoky on the umbo; globose when\r\nyoung, bell-shaped, plane when fully expanded, umbonate, smooth;\r\nslightly viscid when moist, shining when dry, inch to an inch and a half\r\nbroad. The flesh is white and very soft.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free, white at first, then from flesh-color to a reddish\r\nhue from the rosy-colored spores; some of the gills are dimidiate,\r\nsomewhat crowded, broader in the middle.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two inches to two and a half long, tapering from the base\r\nup, smooth, cylindrical, hollow and firm. The volva is always present,\r\nfree, variously torn, white and sometimes grayish.\r\n\r\nThe entire plant is silky when dry. I have found it growing in my buggy\r\nshed. It is not abundant, though quite common. I have never eaten it,\r\nbut I do not doubt its edibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Volvaria pusilla. Pers._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 195.--Volvaria pusilla.]\r\n\r\nThe pileus is explanate, white, fibrillose, dry, striate, center\r\nslightly depressed when mature.\r\n\r\nThe gills are white, becoming flesh-color, from the color of the spores,\r\nfree, distant.\r\n\r\nThe stem is white, smooth, volva split to the base into four nearly\r\nequal segments. The spores are broadly elliptical, 5-6 mc.\r\n\r\nThis is the smallest species of the Volvaria. It grows on the ground\r\namong the weeds and is apt to escape the attention of the collector\r\nunless he knows its habitat. It is quite likely that V. parvula is the\r\nsame plant as this. Also V. temperata, although it has a different\r\nhabitat, seems to be very near this species. The plants in Figure 195\r\nwere collected in Michigan and photographed by Dr. Fischer. The volva is\r\nbrown-tipped as shown in the figure given.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Volvaria volvacea. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE STOVE VOLVARIA.\r\n\r\nIt is called \"The Stove Volvaria\" because it has been found in old\r\nunused stoves. Pileus fleshy, soft, bell-shaped, then expanded, obtuse,\r\nvirgate, with adpressed black fibrils. The gills are free,\r\nflesh-colored, and inclined to deliquesce. The stem is solid, subequal,\r\nwhite. The volva loose, whitish. The spores are smooth, elliptical.\r\n\r\nThis is a much smaller plant than the V. bombycina and grows in the\r\nground. It is often found in hot-houses and cellars.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Entoloma. Fr._\r\n\r\nEntoloma is from two Greek words; _entos_, within; _loma_, a fringe,\r\nreferring to the inner character of the veil, which is seldom even\r\napparent. The members of this genus have rosy spores which are\r\nprominently angular. There is neither volva, nor annulus. The gills are\r\nattached to the stem or notched near the junction of the gills and the\r\nstem. The pileus is fleshy and the margin incurved, especially when\r\nyoung. The stem is fleshy, fibrous, sometimes waxy, continuous with the\r\npileus. It corresponds with Hypholoma, Tricholoma, and Hebeloma. It can\r\nalways be separated from the rosy-spored genera by the notched gills.\r\nThe flesh-colored spores and gills distinguish the Entoloma from the\r\nHebeloma, which has ochre-spored ones, and Tricholoma, which has white\r\nones.\r\n\r\nAll the species, so far as I know, have rather a pleasant odor, and for\r\nthat reason it is highly necessary that the genus and species should be\r\nthoroughly known, as they are all dangerous.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Entoloma rhodopolium. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE ROSE-GRAY ENTOLOMA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 196.--Entoloma rhodopolium. Three-fourths natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nRhodopolium is composed of two Greek words, rose and gray.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to five inches broad, hygrophanous; when moist\r\ndingy-brown or livid, becoming pale when dry, isabelline-livid,\r\nsilky-shining; slightly fleshy, bell-shaped when young, then expanded\r\nand somewhat umbonate, or gibbous, at length rather plane and sometimes\r\ndepressed; fibrillose when young, smooth when full grown; margin at\r\nfirst bent inwards and when large, undulated. Flesh white.\r\n\r\nThe gills adnate, then separating, somewhat sinuate, slightly distant,\r\nbroad, white, then rose color.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to four inches long, hollow; equal when smaller, when\r\nlarger, attenuated upward; white pruinate at the apex, otherwise smooth;\r\nslightly striate, white, often reddish from spores. Spores 8-10×6-8µ.\r\n_Fries_.\r\n\r\nThe plant is found in mixed woods and is rather common. Captain\r\nMcIlvaine reports it edible, but I have never eaten any of the\r\nEntolomas. Some of them have a bad reputation. Found in September and\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Entoloma grayanum. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 197.--Entoloma grayanum. One-half natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe pileus is convex to expanded, sometimes broadly umbonate, drab in\r\ncolor, the surface wrinkled or rugose, and watery in appearance. The\r\nflesh is thin and the margin incurved.\r\n\r\nThe gills are at first drab in color, but lighter than the pileus,\r\nbecoming pinkish in age. The spores on paper are very light\r\nsalmon-color. They are globose or rounded in outline, 5-7 angled, with\r\nan oil globule, 8-10µ, in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe stem is of the same color as the pileus, but lighter, striate,\r\nhollow, somewhat twisted, and enlarged below. The above accurate\r\ndescription was taken from Atkinson's Studies of American Fungi. The\r\nplants were found near a slate cut on the B. & O. railroad near\r\nChillicothe. Not edible. This species and E. grisea are very closely\r\nrelated. The latter is darker in color, with narrower gills, and has a\r\ndifferent habitat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Entoloma subcostatum. Atkinson n. sp._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXX. Figure 198.--Entoloma subcostatum.\r\n\r\nMature plants showing broad gills and very thin flesh, also fibrous\r\nstriate stems.]\r\n\r\nSubcostatum means somewhat ribbed, referring to the gills.\r\n\r\nPlants gregarious or in troups or clusters, 6-8 cm. high; pileus 4-8\r\ncm. broad; stems 1-1.5 cm. thick.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is dark-gray to hair-brown or olive-brown, often subvirgate\r\nwith darker lines; gills light salmon-color, becoming dull; stem colored\r\nas the pileus, but paler; in drying the stems usually become as dark as\r\nthe pileus.\r\n\r\nPileus subviscid when moist, convex to expanded, plane or subgibbous,\r\nnot umbonate, irregular, repand, margin incurved; flesh white, rather\r\nthin, very thin toward the margin.\r\n\r\nGills are broad, 1-1.5 cm. broad, narrowed toward the margin of the\r\npileus, deeply sinuate, the angles usually rounded, adnexed, easily\r\nbecoming free, edge usually pale, sometimes connected by veins,\r\nsometimes costate, especially toward the margin of the pileus.\r\n\r\nBasidia four-spored. Spores subglobose, about six angles, 8-10µ in\r\ndiameter, some slightly longer in the direction of the apiculus,\r\npale-rose under the microscope.\r\n\r\nStem even, fibrous striate, outer bark subcartilaginous, flesh white,\r\nstuffed, becoming fistulose.\r\n\r\nOdor somewhat of old meal and nutty, not pleasant; taste similar.\r\n\r\nRelated to E. prunuloides, Fr., and E. clypeatum, Linn. Differs from the\r\nformer in dark stem and uneven pileus, differs from the latter in being\r\nsubviscid, with even stem, and pileus not umbonate and much more\r\nirregular, and differs from both in subcostate gills. _Atkinson_.\r\n\r\nThe specimens in Plate XXX grew in grassy ground on the campus of the\r\nOhio State University, Columbus, Ohio. They were collected by R. A.\r\nYoung and photographed by Dr. W. A. Kellerman, and through his courtesy\r\nI publish it. The plants were found the last of October, 1906.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Entoloma salmonea. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 199.--Entoloma salmonea.]\r\n\r\nPileus thin, conical or campanulate, subacute, rarely with a minute\r\npapilla at the apex, smooth, of a peculiar soft, ochraceous color,\r\nslightly tinged with salmon or flesh color.\r\n\r\nThe gills and stem are colored like the pileus. _Peck._\r\n\r\nDr. Peck says, \"It is with some hesitation that this is proposed as a\r\nspecies, its resemblance to another species is so close. The only\r\ndifference is found in its color and in the absence of the prominent\r\ncusp of that plant. In both species the pileus is so thin that in well\r\ndried specimens, slender, dark, radiating lines on it, mark the position\r\nof the lamellæ beneath, although in the living plant these are not\r\nvisible.\" The plant in Figure 199 was found in Purgatory Swamp near\r\nBoston, by Mrs. Blackford. They are found in August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Entoloma clypeatum. Linn._\r\n\r\nTHE BUCKLER ENTOLOMA.\r\n\r\n_Clypeatum, a shield or buckler._ The pileus is slightly fleshy, lurid\r\nwhen moist, when dry gray and rather shining, streaked, spotted,\r\ncampanulate, then expanded, umbonate, smooth, watery.\r\n\r\nGills just reaching the stem, rounded, ventricose, somewhat distant,\r\nminutely toothed, dirty flesh-color.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stuffed, then hollow, equal, round, clothed with small\r\nfibers, becoming pale, covered with a minute powdery substance. The\r\nflesh is white when dry. This plant will be distinguished usually by the\r\namount of white mycelium at the base of the stem. Dr. Herbst remarks\r\nthat it is a genuine Entoloma. It is certainly a beautiful plant when\r\nfully developed. It is found in woods and in rich grounds from May till\r\nSeptember. Label it poisonous until its reputation is established.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitopilus. Fr._\r\n\r\nClitopilus is from _clitos_, a declivity; pilos, a cap. This genus has\r\nneither volva nor ring. It is often more or less eccentric, margin at\r\nfirst involute; stem fleshy, diffused upward into the pileus; the gills\r\nare white at first, then pink or salmon-color as the plant matures and\r\nthe spores begin to fall; decurrent, never notched. The pileus is more\r\nor less depressed, darker in the center. The spores are salmon-color, in\r\nsome cases rather pale, smooth or warted. Clitopilus is closely related\r\nto Clitocybe, the latter having white gills, the former pink. It differs\r\nfrom Entoloma just as Clitocybe differs from Tricholoma. It can always\r\nbe distinguished from Eccilia because the stem is never cartilaginous at\r\nthe surface. It differs from the genus, Flammula, mainly in the color of\r\nthe spores.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitopilus prunulus. Scop._\r\n\r\nTHE PLUM CLITOPILUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 200.--Clitopilus prunulus.]\r\n\r\nPrunulus means a small plum; so called from the white bloom covering the\r\nplant.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to four inches broad, fleshy, firm; at first convex,\r\nthen expanded, at length becoming slightly depressed, often eccentric,\r\nas will be seen in Figure 200; whitish, often covered with a frost-like\r\nbloom, margin often wavy, bending backward.\r\n\r\nThe gills are strongly decurrent, comparatively few of full length,\r\nwhite, then flesh-color.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, white, naked, striate, short. Spores, 7-8×5.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most interesting plants because of the various forms\r\nit presents.\r\n\r\nI have found it in various parts of the state and frequently about\r\nChillicothe. It has a pleasant taste, and an odor reminding you of new\r\nmeal. It is tender and its flavor is excellent.\r\n\r\nFound in woods or open woods, especially where it is damp, and under\r\nbeech trees, as well as oak. Found from June to October.\r\n\r\nThe plants in Figure 200 were collected near Ashville, N. C., and\r\nphotographed by Prof. H. C. Beardslee.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitopilus orcellus. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE SWEET-BREAD CLITOPILUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 201.--Clitopilus orcellus.]\r\n\r\nOrcellus is a diminutive meaning a small cask; from _orca_, a cask.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, soft, plane, or slightly depressed, often\r\nirregular, even when young; slightly silky, somewhat viscid when moist;\r\nwhite or yellowish-white, flesh white, taste and odor farinaceous.\r\n\r\nThe gills are deeply decurrent, close, whitish, then flesh-color.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, solid, flocculose, often eccentric, thickened above.\r\nThe spores are elliptical, 9-10×5µ. _Peck_, 42d Rep. N. Y.\r\n\r\nThis plant resembles the Plum mushroom, C. prunulus, very closely in\r\nappearance, taste and odor, but it is considerably smaller. It grows in\r\nwet weather, in open fields and lawns. It is quite widely distributed in\r\nour state, having found it in Salem, Bowling Green, Sidney, and\r\nChillicothe. I frequently find it associated with Marasmius oreades. The\r\nspecimens in Figure 201 were found near Ashville, N. C., and were\r\nphotographed by Prof. H. C. Beardslee. Found from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clitopilus abortivus.

Two-thirds natural\r\nsize, showing the grayish-brown cap and solid stem.]\r\n\r\nAbortivus means abortive or imperfectly developed; so called from its\r\nmany irregular and undeveloped forms.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, firm, convex, or nearly plane, regular or\r\nirregular, dry, clothed with a minute silky tomentum, becoming smoother\r\nwith age, gray or grayish-brown, flesh white, taste and odor\r\nsubfarinaceous.\r\n\r\nThe gills are slightly or deeply decurrent, at first whitish or pale\r\ngray, then flesh-colored. Spores irregular, 7.5-10×6.5µ.\r\n\r\nThe stem is nearly equal, solid, minutely flocculose, sometimes fibrous,\r\nstriate, paler than the pileus. _Peck_, 42d Report N. Y.\r\n\r\nThere are often three forms of this plant; a perfect form, an imperfect\r\nform, and an abortive form as will be seen in Figure 203. The abortive\r\nforms seem to be more common, especially in this locality. They will be\r\ntaken at first to be some form of puff-ball. They are found in open\r\nwoods and in ravines. I found some very fine specimens under beech trees\r\non Cemetery Hill. They are, however, widely distributed over the state\r\nand the United States. The specimens in Figure 203 were collected near\r\nAshville and photographed by Prof. Beardslee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 203.--Clitopilus abortivus.

Pileus thin, convex, then\r\nexpanded or slightly depressed; dingy-white, cracked in areas or\r\nconcentrically rivulose, sometimes obscurely zonate; odor farinaceous,\r\ntaste bitter.\r\n\r\nGills narrow, close, deeply decurrent, some of them forked, white,\r\nbecoming dingy, tinged with yellow or flesh-color.\r\n\r\nStem equal, solid, colored like the pileus, the mycelium white, often\r\nforming white, branching, root-like fibers. Spores globose.\r\n\r\nProf. Beardslee thinks that this species is doubtless identical with _C.\r\npopinalis_ of Europe. He has submitted specimens and photographs to\r\nEuropean mycologists, who hold to this view.\r\n\r\nI found this plant quite abundant on the Huntington Hills after heavy\r\nrains in August. Their season is from August to October. The specimens\r\nin Figure 204 were found growing among leaves after a heavy rain October\r\n10th. The plants have a tendency to turn blackish if they are bruised in\r\nhandling them.\r\n\r\nVar. brevis. This is so called from its short stem. The margin of the\r\npileus is pure white when moist. Gills attached to the stem or slightly\r\ndecurrent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eccilia. Fr._\r\n\r\nEccilia is from a Greek verb which means \"I hollow out\"; so called\r\nbecause the hollow cartilaginous stem expands upward into a\r\nmembranaceous pileus, whose margin at first is incurved. Gills\r\ndecurrent, attenuated behind.\r\n\r\nThis genus corresponds with Omphalia and is separated from Clitopilus by\r\nthe cartilaginous, smooth stem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eccilia carneo-grisea.

It is commonly\r\nreported in fir and pine woods but I find it on the hillsides about\r\nChillicothe in mixed woods. It is frequently found here associated with\r\nBoletinus porosus.\r\n\r\nFound in July, August, and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Eccilia polita. Pers._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 206.--Eccilia polita.

Fr._\r\n\r\nLeptonia means slender, thin.\r\n\r\nThe spores are salmon-color and irregular. The pileus is never truly\r\nfleshy, cuticle always torn into scales, disk umbilicate, and often\r\ndarker than the margin which is at first incurved. The gills are\r\nattached to the stem and easily separated in old plants. The stem is\r\nrigid, with cartilaginous bark, hollow or stuffed, smooth, shining,\r\noften dark-blue, confluent with the cap.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Leptonia incana. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE HOARY LEPTONIA.\r\n\r\nIncana means hoary or grayish-white.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is about one inch broad, somewhat membranaceous, convex, then\r\nplane, depressed in the center, smooth, with a silky lustre, margin\r\nstriate.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, broad, somewhat distant, white, then\r\ngreenish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow, shining, smooth, brownish-green. The spores are very\r\nirregular, dull-yellowish, pink, rough, 8-9µ.\r\n\r\nIt is frequently found in pastures after warm rains. They grow in\r\nclusters, and have the odor of mice to a marked degree.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Leptonia serrulata. Pers._\r\n\r\nSAW LEPTONIA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 207.--Leptonia serrulata.]\r\n\r\nSerrulata means saw-bearing, so named from the serrulate character of\r\nthe gills.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is dark-blue, flesh thin, umbilicate, depressed, without\r\nstriate, squamulose.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, with a dark serrulate edge.\r\n\r\nThe stem is thin, cartilaginous, paler than the pileus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nolanea. Fr._\r\n\r\nNolanea means a little bell, so called from the shape of the pileus.\r\n\r\nIt is rosy-spored. The stem is cartilaginous and hollow. The pileus is\r\nsubmembranaceous, thin, bell-shaped, papillate, margin straight, pressed\r\nclose to the stem. The gills are free and not decurrent. They are found\r\ngrowing on the ground in the woods and pastures.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nolanea pascua. P._\r\n\r\nTHE PASTURE NOLANEA.\r\n\r\nPascua means pasture.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is membranaceous, conical, then expanded, slightly umbonate,\r\nsmooth, striate, watery; when dry, shining like silk.\r\n\r\nThe gills are nearly free, ventricose, crowded, dirty-grayish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow, fragile, silky-fibrous, striate. The spores are\r\nirregular, 9-10. They are found in pastures in summer and fall, after\r\na rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nolanea conica. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE CONE NOLANEA.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is thin, membranaceous, conical, with a minute umbo or\r\npapilla, cinnamon-color, striatulate when moist.\r\n\r\nThe gills are light flesh-color, nearly free.\r\n\r\nThe stem is slender, straight, hollow.\r\n\r\nFound in moist woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Claudopus. Smith._\r\n\r\nClaudopus is from two Greek words: _claudos_, lame; _pus_, foot.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is eccentric or lateral like the Pleuroti. The species were\r\nformerly placed in the Pleuroti and Crepidoti, which they very closely\r\nresemble, save in the color of the spores. This genus formerly included\r\nthose plants which have lilac spores, but Prof. Fries limited it to\r\nthose which have pink spores. The spores in some species are even and in\r\nothers, rough and angular. The stem is either wanting or very short,\r\nhence its name. All are found on decayed wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Claudopus nidulans. Pers._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 208.--Claudopus nidulans. One-half natural size.\r\nCap yellow or buff. Gills orange-yellow.]\r\n\r\nNidulans is from _nidus_, a nest.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is sessile, sometimes narrowed behind into a short stem-like\r\nbase, caps often overlapping one another, kidney-shaped, quite downy,\r\nthe margin involute, hairy toward the margin, a rich yellow or buff\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nThe gills are broad, moderately close, orange-yellow.\r\n\r\nThe spores are even, 3-5×1µ, elongated, somewhat curved, delicate pink\r\nin mass. It is quite common in the woods about Chillicothe. A maple log\r\nfrom which I secured the specimen photographed in Figure 208 was\r\ncompletely covered and presented a beautiful sight. It has a rather\r\nstrong and disagreeable odor. It is edible, but generally tough, and\r\nmust be chopped very fine and cooked well. It is found in woods, on logs\r\nand stumps, from August to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Claudopus variabilis. Pers._\r\n\r\n_Variabilis, variable or changeable._ The pileus is white, thin,\r\nresupinate--that is the plant seems to be on its back, the gills being\r\nturned upward toward the light, quite downy, even, being fastened in the\r\ncenter to a short downy stem.\r\n\r\nThe gills are at first white, then of the color of the spores.\r\n\r\nIt is found on decaying limbs and branches in the woods. It is quite\r\ncommon everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE RUSTY-SPORED AGARICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spores are of various shades of ochre yellow, rusty, rusty-brown,\r\nbrown, yellowish-brown. The hymenophore is never free from the stem in\r\nthe rusty-spored series, nor is there a volva.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pholiota. Fr._\r\n\r\nPholiota, a scale. The members of this genus have rusty spores. These\r\nmay be sepia-brown, bright yellowish-brown or light red. There is no\r\nvolva, but there is a ring which is sometimes persistent, friable, and\r\nfugacious. In this respect it corresponds with the Armillaria among the\r\nwhite spored agarics. The pileus is fleshy. The gills are attached to\r\nthe stem and sometimes notched with a decurrent tooth, tawny or rusty in\r\ncolor on account of the falling of the spores. Many species grow on\r\nwood, logs, stumps, and branches of trees, although others grow on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pholiota precox. Pers._\r\n\r\nTHE EARLY PHOLIOTA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 209.--Pholiota precox. Two-thirds natural size.\r\nCaps whitish, often tinged with yellow.]\r\n\r\n_Precox, early._ Pileus is fleshy, soft, convex, then expanded, at\r\nlength smooth, even, margin at first incurved; moist but not sticky,\r\nwhitish, often with slight tinge of yellow or tan-color; when the plant\r\nis fully matured it is often upturned and fluted.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem and slightly decurrent by a tooth,\r\nmoderately broad, crowded, unequal, creamy white, then rusty-brown.\r\nSpores brownish, 8-13×6-7µ.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stuffed, then hollow, often striate above the ring, rather\r\nslender, sometimes mealy, skin peeling readily, whitish. The spores are\r\nrusty-brown and elliptical. The caps are from one to two inches broad,\r\nand the stem is from two to three inches long. The veil is stretched\r\nlike a drumhead from the stem to the margin of the cap. It varies in\r\nmanner of breaking; sometimes it separates from the margin of the cap\r\nand forms a ring around the stem; again, but little remains on the stem\r\nand much on the rim of the cap.\r\n\r\nIt appears every year on the Chillicothe high school lawn. The gills are\r\ncreamy-white when the cap first opens, but they soon turn to a\r\nrusty-brown. It comes in May. I have never found it after June. I am\r\nalways delighted to find it for it is always appetizing at that season.\r\nLook for them on lawns and pastures and in grain fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pholiota dura. Bolt._\r\n\r\nTHE HARD PHOLIOTA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 210.--Pholiota dura. One-half natural size. Caps\r\ntawny tan-color.]\r\n\r\nDura, hard; so called because the surface of the cap becomes quite hard\r\nand cracked. The pileus is from three to four inches or more broad, very\r\ncompact, convex, then plane, cuticle often very much cracked, margin\r\neven, tawny, tan-color, sometimes quite brown.\r\n\r\nThe gills are firmly attached to the stem, somewhat decurrent with a\r\ntooth, ventricose, livid, then a brown rusty color. Spores elliptical,\r\n8-9×5-6µ.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stuffed, hard, externally fibrous, thickened toward the\r\napex, sometimes ventricose, often irregularly shaped.\r\n\r\nOn June 6th, 1904, I found Mr. Dillman's garden on Hickory street,\r\nChillicothe, white with this plant. Some were very large and beautiful\r\nand I had an excellent opportunity to observe the irregularity in the\r\nform of the stem. Some years previous I found a garden in Sidney, Ohio,\r\nequally filled. In the fall of 1905 I was asked to drive out about seven\r\nmiles from Chillicothe to see a wheat-field, the last of October, that\r\nwas white with mushrooms. I found them to be of this species.\r\n\r\nOnly the young plants should be used, as the older ones are a bit tough.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pholiota adiposa. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE FAT OR PINEAPPLE PHOLIOTA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 211.--Pholiota adiposa. Two-thirds natural size.\r\nCaps saffron-yellow.]\r\n\r\nAdiposa is from _adeps_, fat. The pileus is showy, deep-yellow, compact,\r\nconvex, obtuse, slightly umbonate, quite viscid when moist, shining when\r\ndry; cuticle plain or broken into scales which are dark-brown, the\r\nmargin incurved; the flesh is saffron-yellow, thick at the center and\r\nthinning out toward the margin.\r\n\r\nThe gills are firmly attached to the stem, sometimes slightly notched,\r\nclose, yellow, then rust-color with age. Spores elliptical, 7×3µ.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal, stuffed, tough, thickening at the base, brown below\r\nand yellow above, quite scaly.\r\n\r\nThe beautiful appearance of the tufts or clusters in which the Pineapple\r\nPholiotas grow will attract the attention of an ordinarily unobservant\r\nbeholder. The scales on the cap seem to contract and rise from the\r\nsurface and sometimes disappear with age. The caps of mushrooms should\r\nnot ordinarily be peeled before cooking, but it is better to peel this\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe ring is slight and the specimens represented here were found on a\r\nstump in Miss Effie Mace's yard, on Paint Street, Chillicothe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pholiota Caperata. Pers._\r\n\r\nTHE WRINKLED PHOLIOTA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nCaperata means wrinkled.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXXI. Figure 212.--Pholiota caperata.]\r\n\r\nThe pileus is three to four inches broad, fleshy, varying from a clay to\r\na yellowish color, at first somewhat egg-shaped, then expanded, obtuse,\r\nwrinkled at the sides, the entire cap and especially at the center is\r\ncovered with a white superficial flocci.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnate or attached to the stem, rather crowded, this,\r\nsomewhat toothed on their edges, clay-cinnamon color. Spores elliptical,\r\n12×4.5µ.\r\n\r\nThe stem is four to five inches long, solid, stout, round, somewhat\r\nbulbous at the base, white, scaly above the ring, which is often very\r\nslight, often only a trace, as will be seen on the left hand plant in\r\nFigure 212.\r\n\r\nThe spores are dark ferruginous when caught on white paper, but paler on\r\ndark paper.\r\n\r\nThe white superficial flocci will mark the plant. It has a wide\r\ndistribution throughout the states. I found it in a number of places in\r\nOhio and it is quite plentiful about Chillicothe. It is a favorite in\r\nGermany and it is called by the common people \"Zigeuner,\" a Gypsy.\r\n\r\nIt is found in September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pholiota unicolor. Fl. Dan._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 213.--Pholiota unicolor. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nUnicolor means of one color.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is campanulate to convex, subumbonate, hygrophanous, bay,\r\nthen ochre, nearly even, never fully expanded.\r\n\r\nThe gills are subtriangular, adnate, seceding, broad,\r\nochraceous-cinnamon. Spores 9-10×5µ.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stuffed, then hollow, colored as the pileus, nearly smooth,\r\nring thin but entire.\r\n\r\nThey are a late grower and found on well-decayed logs. They are quite\r\ncommon in our woods. Found in November. The plants in Figure 213 were\r\nfound on the 24th of November, in Haynes' Hollow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pholiota mutablis. Schaff._\r\n\r\nTHE CHANGEABLE PHOLIOTA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nMutablis means changeable, variable. The pileus two to three inches\r\nbroad, fleshy; deep cinnamon when moist, paler when dry; margin rather\r\nthin, transparent; convex, then expanded, sometimes obtusely umbonate,\r\nand sometimes slightly depressed; even, quite smooth, flesh whitish and\r\ntaste mild.\r\n\r\nThe gills are broad, adnate, slightly decurrent, close, pale umber, then\r\ncinnamon-color.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three inches long, slender, stuffed, becoming hollow,\r\nsmooth above or minutely pulverulent, and pale, below slightly scaly up\r\nto the ring, and darker at the base, ring membranaceous, externally\r\nscaly. The spores are ellipsoid, 9-11×5-6µ.\r\n\r\nI find this specimen growing in a cæspitose manner on decayed wood. It\r\nis quite common here late in the season. I found some very large\r\nspecimens on Thanksgiving day, 1905, in Gallia County, Ohio. It is one\r\nof the latest edible plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pholiota heteroclita. Fr._\r\n\r\nBULBOUS-STEMMED PHOLIOTA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 214.--Pholiota heteroclita. Natural size. Caps\r\nwhitish or yellowish.]\r\n\r\nHeteroclitus means leaning to one side, out of the center.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is three to six inches broad, compact, convex, expanded, very\r\nobtuse, rather eccentric, marked with scattered, innate, adpressed\r\nscales, whitish or yellowish, sometimes smooth when dry, viscid if\r\nmoist.\r\n\r\nThe gills are very broad, at first pallid, then ferruginous, rounded,\r\nadnexed.\r\n\r\nThe stem is three to four inches long, solid, hard, bulbous at the base,\r\nfibrillose, white or whitish; veil apical, ring fugacious,\r\nappendiculate. The spores are subelliptical, 8-10×5-6µ.\r\n\r\nThis species has a strong and pungent odor very much like horse-radish.\r\nIt grows on wood and its favorite hosts are the poplar and the birch. It\r\nis found at almost any time in the fall. The specimens in the Figure 214\r\nwere found in Michigan and photographed by Dr. Fischer, of Detroit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pholiota aurevella. Batsch._\r\n\r\nGOLDEN PHOLIOTA.\r\n\r\nAurevella is from _auri-vellus_, a golden fleece.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to three inches in diameter, bell-shaped, convex,\r\ngibbous, tawny-yellow, with darker scales, rather viscid.\r\n\r\nThe gills are crowded, notched behind, fixed, very broad, plane, pallid\r\nolive, at length ferruginous.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stuffed, nearly equal, hard, various in length, curved, with\r\nrusty adpressed squamules, ring rather distant. On trunks of trees in\r\nthe fall, generally solitary. Not very common.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pholiota curvipes. Fr._\r\n\r\nCurvipes, with a curved foot or stem. Pileus is rather fleshy, convex,\r\nthen expanded, torn into adpressed floccose scales.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnate, broad, white, then yellowish, at length tawny.\r\n\r\nThe stem is somewhat hollow, thin, incurved (from which it derives its\r\nname), fibrillose, yellow, as well as is the floccose ring. Spores\r\n6-7×3-4. _Cooke._\r\n\r\nI found several specimens of this species at different times on one well\r\nrotted beech log on Ralston's Run, but was unable to find it on any\r\nother log in any woods near Chillicothe. I had trouble to place it till\r\nProf. Atkinson helped me out. I found it from August to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pholiota spectabilis. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE SHOWY PHOLIOTA.\r\n\r\nSpectabilis, of notable appearance, worth seeing. The pileus is compact,\r\nconvex, then plane, dry, torn into silky scales disappearing toward the\r\nmargin, golden orange color, flesh yellow.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnexed, rounded near the stem, slightly decurrent,\r\ncrowded, narrow, yellow, then ferruginous.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, three to four inches high, quite thick, tough,\r\nspongy, thickened toward the base, even, bulbous, somewhat rooting. Ring\r\ninferior. I found the specimens in October and November. It may grow\r\nearlier. Found on decayed oak stumps.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pholiota marginata. Batsch._\r\n\r\nTHE MARGINATE PHOLIOTA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 215.--Pholiota marginata. Two-thirds natural size.\r\nCaps honey-colored and tan-colored.]\r\n\r\nMarginata means edged, margined; so called from the peripheral striæ of\r\nthe pileus.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is rather fleshy, convex, then plane, smooth, moist, watery,\r\nstriate on the margin, honey-colored when moist, tan-colored when dry.\r\n\r\nThe gills are firmly attached to the stem, crowded, unequal; when\r\nmature, of a dark reddish-brown from the shedding of the spores. Spores\r\n7-8×4µ.\r\n\r\nThe stem is cylindrical, smooth, hollow, of the same color as the\r\npileus, covered with a frost-like bloom above the ring, which is distant\r\nfrom the apex of the stem and frequently disappears entirely.\r\n\r\nIt is quite common, being found on nearly every rotten log in our woods.\r\nIt comes early and lasts till late in the fall. The caps are excellent\r\nwhen well prepared.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pholiota ægerita. Fr._\r\n\r\nÆgerita is the Greek name for the black poplar; so called because it\r\ngrows on decayed poplar logs. The pileus is fleshy, convex, then plane,\r\nmore or less checked or rivulose, wrinkled, tawny, edge of the cap\r\nrather pale.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnate, with a decurrent tooth, rather close, pallid, then\r\ngrowing darker.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stuffed, equal, silky-white, ring superior, fibrillose,\r\ntumid. Spores 10×5µ.\r\n\r\nFound in October and November, in the woods wherever there are decayed\r\npoplar logs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pholiota squarrosoides. Pk._\r\n\r\nLIKE THE SCALY PHOLIOTA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 216.--Pholiota squarrosoides. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize. Caps yellow or yellowish.]\r\n\r\nSquarrosoides means like Squarrosa. The pileus is quite firm, convex,\r\nviscid, especially when moist; at first densely covered with erect\r\npapillose or subspinose tawny scales, which soon separate from each\r\nother, revealing the whitish or yellowish color of the cap and its\r\nviscid character.\r\n\r\nThe gills are close, emarginate, at first whitish, then pallid or dull\r\ncinnamon color.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal, firm, stuffed, rough, with thick squarrose scales,\r\nwhite above the thick floccose annulus, pallid or tawny below. The\r\nspores are minute, elliptical, .0002 inch long, .00015 inch broad.\r\n\r\nThey grow in tufts on dead trunks and old stumps, especially of the\r\nsugar maple. They closely resemble P. squarrosa. Found late in the fall.\r\nIts favorite haunt is the inside of a stump or within the protection of\r\na log.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pholiota squarrosa. Mull._\r\n\r\nTHE SCALY PHOLIOTA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate XXXII. Figure 217.--Pholiota squarrosa.]\r\n\r\nSquarrosa means scaly. The pileus is three to four inches broad, fleshy,\r\nbell-shaped, convex, then expanded; obtusely umbonate, tawny-yellow,\r\nclothed with rich brown scales; flesh yellow near the surface.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, with a decurrent tooth, at first\r\nyellowish, then of a pale olive, changing to rusty-brown in color,\r\ncrowded, and narrow. The spores are elliptical, 8×4µ.\r\n\r\nThe stem is three to six inches high, saffron yellow, stuffed, clothed\r\nwith small fibers, scaly like the pileus, attenuated at the base from\r\nthe manner of its growth. The ring is close to the apex, downy, rich\r\nbrown, inclining to orange in color.\r\n\r\nThis is quite a common and showy mushroom. It is found on rotten wood,\r\non or near stumps, growing out from a root underground, and is often\r\nfound at the foot of trees. Only the caps of the young specimens should\r\nbe eaten. It is found from August to late frost.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inocybe. Fr._\r\n\r\nInocybe is from two Greek words meaning fiber and head; so called from\r\nthe fibrillose veil, concrete with the cuticle of the pileus, often free\r\nat the margin, in the form of a cortina. The gills are somewhat sinuate,\r\nthough they are sometimes adnate, and in two species are decurrent;\r\nchanging color but not powdered with cinnamon. Spores are often rough\r\nbut in other specimens are even, more or less brownish rust-color.\r\n_Stevenson._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inocybe scaber. Mull._\r\n\r\nROUGH INOCYBE. NOT EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nScaber means rough. The pileus is fleshy, conical, convex, obtusely\r\ngibbous, sprinkled with fibrous adpressed scales; margin entire,\r\ngrayish-brown.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rounded near the stem, quite crowded, pale dingy-brown.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, whitish or paler than the pileus, clothed with small\r\nfibers, equal, veiled. The spores are elliptical, smooth, 11×5µ.\r\n\r\nIt is found on the ground in damp woods. Not good.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inocybe lacera. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE TORN INOCYBE.\r\n\r\nLacera means torn.

Spores are obliquely elliptical, smooth, 12×6µ.\r\n\r\nThe stem is slender, short, stuffed, clothed with small fibers, naked\r\nabove, reddish within.\r\n\r\nFound on the ground where the soil is clayish or poor. Not good.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inocybe subochracea Burtii. Peck._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 218.--Inocybe subochracea Burtii. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nThis is a very interesting species. It is thus described by Dr. Peck:\r\n\"Veil conspicuous, webby fibrillose, margin of the pileus more\r\nfibrillose; stem longer and more conspicuously fibrillose. The well\r\ndeveloped veil, and the longer stem, are the distinguishing characters\r\nof this variety.\"\r\n\r\nThe plants are found in mossy patches on the north hillsides about\r\nChillicothe. The pale ochraceous yellow and the very fibrillose caps and\r\nstem will attract the attention of the collector at once. The caps are\r\none to two and a half inches broad and the stem is two to three inches\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inocybe subochracea. Peck._\r\n\r\nPileus thin, conical or convex, sometimes expanded, generally umbonate,\r\nfibrillose squamulose, pale ochraceous-yellow.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rather broad, attached, emarginate, whitish, becoming\r\nbrownish-yellow.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal, whitish, slightly fibrillose, solid. _Peck._\r\n\r\nThis is a small plant from one to two inches high whose cap is scarcely\r\nover an inch broad. It grows in open groves where the soil is sandy. It\r\nis found on Cemetery Hill from June to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inocybe geophylla, var. violacea. Pat._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 219.--Inocybe geophylla, var. violacea.]\r\n\r\nThis is a small plant and has all the characteristics of Inocybe\r\ngeophylla excepting color of cap and gills.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is an inch to an inch and a half broad, hemispherical at\r\nfirst, then expanded, umbonate, even, silky-fibrillose, lilac, growing\r\npaler in age.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnexed, lilac at first, then colored by the spores.\r\nSpores 10×5.\r\n\r\nThe stem equal, firm, hollow, slightly violaceous.\r\n\r\nThis plant grows in September in mixed woods among the dead leaves. Its\r\nbright violet color will arrest the attention at once.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inocybe dulcamara. A. & S._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 220.--Inocybe dulcamara.]\r\n\r\nDulcamara means bitter-sweet. The pileus is an inch to an inch and a\r\nhalf in diameter, rather fleshy, convex, umbonate, pilosely-scaly.\r\n\r\nThe gills are arcuate, ventricose, pallid olivaceous.\r\n\r\nThe stem is somewhat hollow, fibrillose and squamulose from the veil,\r\nfarinaceous at the apex.

Two-thirds natural size.\r\nCaps scaly, dark or grayish-brown.]\r\n\r\nCincinnata means with curled hair. This is quite an interesting little\r\nplant. It is found on Cemetery Hill, in Chillicothe, under the pine\r\ntrees and along the walks where there is but little grass. It is\r\ngregarious and quite a hardy plant.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, convex, then plane, quite squarrosely scaly,\r\nsomewhat dark or grayish-brown.\r\n\r\nThe gills are grayish-brown with a tinge of violet at times; adnexed,\r\nrather close, ventricose.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, slender, scaly, somewhat lighter than the pileus. The\r\nspores are 8-10×5µ.\r\n\r\nThis plant seems to be a late grower. I did not find it till about the\r\n15th of October and it continued till the last of November. I had found\r\ntwo other species on the same hill earlier in the season. No Inocybes\r\nare good to eat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inocybe pyriodora. Pers._\r\n\r\nPyriodora, smelling like a pear. The pileus is one to two inches broad,\r\nquite strongly umbonate, at first conical, expanded, covered with\r\nfibrous adpressed scales, in old plants the margin turned up, smoky or\r\nbrown-ochre becoming pale.\r\n\r\nThe gills are notched at the stem, not crowded, dingy-white, becoming\r\nnearly cinnamon-brown, somewhat ventricose.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three inches long, stuffed, firm, equal, pale, apex\r\npruinose, veil very fugacious. Flesh tinged with red.\r\n\r\nCommon in the woods in September and October. The plant is not edible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Inocybe rimosa. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE CRACKED INOCYBE.\r\n\r\nRimosa, cracked. The pileus is one to two inches broad, shining, satiny,\r\nadpressed fibrillose, brown-yellow, campanulate, then expanded,\r\nlongitudinally cracked.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free, somewhat ventricose, at first white, brownish-clay\r\ncolor.\r\n\r\nThe stem is one to two inches high, distant from the pileus, solid,\r\nfirm, nearly smooth, bulbous, mealy white above. Spores smooth,\r\n10-11×6µ.\r\n\r\nI. eutheles differs from this species in being umbonate; I. pyriodora in\r\nits strong smell. Many plants will often be found in one place in open\r\nwoods or in cleared places. Their radiately cracked pilei, with the\r\ninner substance showing yellow through the cracks, will help to\r\ndistinguish the species. Found from June to September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hebeloma. Fr._\r\n\r\nHebeloma is from two Greek words meaning youth and fringed. Partial veil\r\nfibrillose or absent. Pileus is smooth, continuous, somewhat viscid,\r\nmargin incurved.

The pileus is one to three inches broad,\r\nlight-yellow, the disk darker, fleshy, convex, then plane, covered with\r\na viscid gluten in wet weather; flesh is white, becoming yellow.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, notched, slightly decurrent,\r\ncrowded, pallid, light yellow, then clay-color. Spores elliptical,\r\n10-12×5µ.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stuffed, firm, somewhat bulbous, covered with white scales,\r\nand mealy at the top. There is a partial veil in the form of a cortina.\r\n\r\nFound among leaves in the woods. In wet weather the gluten is abundant.\r\nWhile it is not poisonous it is not good.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hebeloma fastibile. Fr._\r\n\r\nOCHREY HEBELOMA. POISONOUS.\r\n\r\nFastibilis means nauseous, disagreeable; so called from its pungent\r\ntaste and smell.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one to three inches across, convex, plane, wavy, viscid,\r\nsmooth, pale yellowish-tan, margin involute and downy.\r\n\r\nThe gills are notched, rather distant, pallid, then cinnamon;\r\nlachrymose.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to four inches long, solid, subbulbous, white, fibrous\r\nscaly, sometimes twisted, often becoming hollow, veil evident. The\r\nspores are pip-shaped, 10×6µ.\r\n\r\nThe odor is much the same as in H. crustuliniforme but it differs in\r\nhaving a manifest veil and more distant gills. Found in woods from July\r\nto October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hebeloma crustuliniforme. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE RING HEBELOMA. NOT EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nCrustuliniforme means the form of a cake or bun.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is convex, then expanded, smooth, somewhat viscid, often\r\nwavy, yellowish-red, quite variable in size.\r\n\r\nThe gills are notched, thin, narrow, whitish then brown, crowded, edge\r\ncrenulate, and with beads of moisture.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, or stuffed, firm, subbulbous, whitish, with minute\r\nwhite recurved flecks.\r\n\r\nIt is found in woods or about old sawdust piles. The plants sometimes\r\ngrow in rings. September to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hebeloma pascuense. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 222.--Hebeloma pascuense. Natural size. Caps\r\nchestnut-color.]\r\n\r\nPascuense, pertaining to pastures; referring to its habitat.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is convex, becoming nearly plane, viscid when moist,\r\nobscurely innately fibrillose; brownish-clay, often darker or rufescent\r\nin the center, the margin in the young plant slightly whitened by the\r\nthin webby veil; the margin of the cap more or less irregular, flesh\r\nwhite, the taste mild, odor weak.\r\n\r\nThe gills are close, rounded behind, adnexed, whitish, becoming pale\r\nochraceous.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, firm, equal, solid, fibrillose, slightly mealy at the\r\ntop, whitish or pallid.\r\n\r\nThe spores are pale ochraceous, subelliptical. I found the plants in\r\nFigure 222 on Cemetery Hill late in November. It is a very low plant,\r\ngrowing under the pine trees and keeping close to the walks. The\r\nwhitened margin of the young plant is a very good ear-mark by which to\r\nknow this species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pluteolus. Fr._\r\n\r\nPluteolus means a small shed. It is the diminutive of _pluteus_, a shed\r\nor penthouse, from its conical cap.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is rather fleshy, viscid, conical or campanulate, then\r\nexpanded; margin at first straight, adpressed to the stem. Stem somewhat\r\ncartilaginous, distinct from the hymenophore. Gills free, rounded\r\nbehind.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pluteolus reticulatus. Pers._\r\n\r\nReticulatus means made like a net; from _rete_, a net, so called from\r\nthe net-like appearance of veins on the cap.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is slightly fleshy, campanulate, then expanded,\r\nrugoso-reticulate, viscid, margin striate, pale violaceous.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free, ventricose, crowded, saffron-yellow, to ferruginous.\r\n\r\nThe stem is one to two inches long, hollow, fragile, fibrillose,\r\ninclined to be mealy at the top, white.\r\n\r\nI have found only a few plants of this species in our state. It seems to\r\nbe rare. The anastomosing veins on the cap and its pale violaceous color\r\nwill mark the species. I have always found it on decayed wood. Captain\r\nMcIlvaine speaks of finding it in quantities on the stems of fallen\r\nweeds and says it was tender and of fine flavor. September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Galera. Fr._\r\n\r\nGalera means a small cap. The pileus is more or less bell-shaped, margin\r\nstraight, at first depressed to the stem, hygrophanous, almost even,\r\natomate when dry, more or less membranaceous.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem or with a decurrent tooth, as in\r\nMycena.\r\n\r\nThe stem is cartilaginous, hollow, confluent with, but different in\r\ntexture from the cap. The veil is often wanting, but when present is\r\nfibrous and fugacious. The spores are ochraceous ferruginous.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Galera hypnorum. Batsch._\r\n\r\nTHE MOSS-LOVING GALERA.\r\n\r\nHypnorum means of mosses; from _hypna_, moss.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is membranaceous, conic, campanulate, smooth, striate, watery\r\nwhen moist, pale when dry, cinnamon.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, broad, rather distant,\r\ncinnamon-colored, whitish on the edge.\r\n\r\nThe stem is slender, wavy, same color as the pileus, pruinose at the\r\napex. This plant is very like G. tenera, only much smaller, and of a\r\nvery different habitat. Found in mosses from June to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Galera tenera. Schaeff._\r\n\r\nTHE SLENDER GALERA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 223.--Galera tenera.]\r\n\r\nTenera is the feminine form of _tener_, slender, delicate.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is somewhat membranaceous, at first cone-shaped, partially\r\nexpanded, bell-shaped, hygrophanous, ochraceous when dry.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, crowded, rather broad, ascending,\r\ncinnamon-brown, the edges whitish, sometimes slightly serrate.\r\n\r\nThe stem is straight, hollow, fragile, rather shining; three to four\r\ninches long, equal or sometimes inclined to thicken downward, of nearly\r\nthe same color as the pileus. The spores are elliptical and a dark\r\nrust-color, 12-13×7µ.\r\n\r\nYou will frequently meet a variety whose cap and stem are quite\r\npubescent but whose other characteristics agree with G. tenera. Prof.\r\nPeck calls it G. tenera var. pilosella.\r\n\r\nFound in richly manured lawns and pastures. It is quite common. The\r\ncaps, only, are good.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Galera lateritia. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE BRICK-RED GALERA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nLateritia means made of brick, from _later_, a brick; so called because\r\nthe caps are brick-colored.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is somewhat membranaceous, cone-shaped, then bell-shaped,\r\nobtuse, even, hygrophanous, rather pale yellow when wet, ochraceous when\r\ndry.\r\n\r\nThe gills are almost free, adnexed to the top of the cone, linear, very\r\nnarrow, tawny or ferruginous.\r\n\r\nThe stem is three to four inches long, hollow, slightly tapering upward,\r\nstraight, fragile, white pruinose, whitish. Spores are elliptical,\r\n11-12×5-6µ.\r\n\r\nThis plant resembles G. ovalis, from which it can be distinguished by\r\nits linear ascending gills and the absence of a veil.\r\n\r\nFound on dung and in richly manured pastures, from July to frost.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Galera Kellermani. Pk. sp. nov._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 224.--Galera Kellermani. Showing young plants.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 225.--Galera Kellermani. Showing older plants.]\r\n\r\nKellermani is named in honor of Dr. W. A. Kellerman, Ohio State\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is very thin, subovate or subconic, soon becoming plane or\r\nnearly so; striatulate nearly to the center when moist, more or less\r\nwavy and persistently striate on the margin when dry, minutely granulose\r\nor mealy when young, unpolished when mature, often with a few scattered\r\nfloccose squamules when young, and sometimes with a few slight fragments\r\nof a veil adhering to the margin which appears as if finely notched by\r\nthe projecting ends of the gills; watery-brown when moist, grayish-brown\r\nwhen dry, a little darker in the center; taste slight, odor faint, like\r\nthat of decaying wood.\r\n\r\nThe gills are thin, close, adnate, a delicate cinnamon-brown becoming\r\ndarker with age. The stem is two and a half to four cm. long, slender,\r\nequal, or slightly tapering upward; finely striate, minutely scurvy or\r\nmealy, at least when young; hollow, white. The spores are brownish\r\nferruginous with a faint pinkish tint in mass, elliptic, 8-12×6-7µ.\r\n_Peck._\r\n\r\nDr. Peck says the distinguishing features of this species are its\r\nbroadly expanded or plane grayish-brown pileus, with its granulose or\r\nmealy surface, its persistently striate margin, and its very narrow\r\ngills becoming brownish with age. I have seen the plant growing in the\r\nculture beds in the greenhouse of the Ohio State University. It is a\r\nbeautiful plant. Plants of all ages are shown in Figures 224 and 225.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Galera crispa. Longyear._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 226.--Galera crispa. Natural size. Cap\r\nochraceous-brown.]\r\n\r\nCrispa means crisped; the specific name is based on the peculiar\r\ncharacter of the gills which are always crisped as soon as the pileus is\r\nexpanded.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is 1.5 to 3.5 cm. broad, membranaceous, persistently\r\nconico-campanulate, subacute, uneven and somewhat rivulose,\r\nochraceous-brown on disk, lighter toward the margin which becomes\r\ncrenulate and upturned in older specimens; slightly pruinose at first,\r\nrugulose and a little paler when dry.\r\n\r\nThe gills are adnexed, not crowded, rather narrow, interspersed with\r\nanastomosing veins; much crisped; at first nearly white, then becoming\r\nferruginous from the spores.\r\n\r\nThe stem is 7 to 10 cm. long, tapering from a somewhat bulbous base,\r\nyellowish-white, pruinose at base, hollow, fragile. The spores are\r\n8-10µ broad, 12-16µ long. _Longyear._\r\n\r\nThey are found in grass on lawns and in pastures, June and July.\r\n\r\nDr. Peck, to whom specimens were referred, suggested that they may be a\r\nvariety of G. lateritia, unless the peculiar character of the gills\r\nproved to be constant. Prof. Longyear has found the plant frequently in\r\nMichigan and it was found by him in the City Park, Denver, Col., in\r\nJuly, 1905.\r\n\r\nIts distinguishing characteristic is sufficiently constant to make the\r\nrecognition of the species a matter of ease. The plants in Figure 226\r\nwere photographed by Prof. B. O. Longyear.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Galera ovalis. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE OVAL GALERA.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is somewhat membranaceous, oval or bell-shaped, even, watery,\r\ndusky-rust color, somewhat larger than G. tenera.\r\n\r\nThe gills are almost free, ventricose, very broad, rust-colored.\r\n\r\nThe stem is straight, equal, slightly striate, nearly of the same color\r\nas the cap, about three inches long. Found in pastures where stock has\r\nbeen. I have found it in the Dunn pasture, on the Columbus pike, Ross\r\nCounty, O.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crepidotus. Fr._\r\n\r\n_Crepidotus_ is from a Greek word meaning a slipper. The spores are dark\r\nor yellowish-brown. There is no veil. The pileus is excentric, dimidiate\r\nor resupinate. The flesh is soft. The stem is lateral or wanting, when\r\npresent it is continuous with the cap. They generally grow on wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crepidotus versutus. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 227.--Crepidotus versutus. Natural size. Caps pure\r\nwhite.]\r\n\r\nThis is a very modest little plant growing on the underside of rotten\r\nlogs or bark, thus, no doubt, escaping the attention of many. Sometimes\r\nit may be found growing from the side of a log, in which case it grows\r\nin a shelving form. When growing under the log the upper side of the\r\ncap is against the wood and it is said to be resupinate.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is kidney-form, quite small, thin, pure white, covered with a\r\nsoft whitish down.\r\n\r\nThe gills are radiate from the point of attachment of the cap, not\r\ncrowded, whitish, then ferruginous from the spores.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crepidotus mollis. Schaeff._\r\n\r\nSOFT CREPIDOTUS.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is between subgelatinous and fleshy; one to two inches broad;\r\nsometimes solitary, sometimes imbricated; flaccid, even, smooth,\r\nreniform, subsessile, pallid, then grayish.\r\n\r\nThe gills are decurrent from base, crowded, linear, whitish then watery\r\ncinnamon. The spores are elliptical, ferruginous, 8-9×5-6µ.\r\n\r\nThis species is widely distributed and quite common on decayed logs and\r\nstumps, from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Naucoria. Fr._\r\n\r\nNaucoria, a nut shell. The pileus is some shade of yellow, convex,\r\ninflexed, smooth, flocculent or scaly. The gills are attached to the\r\nstem, sometimes nearly free, never decurrent. The stem is cartilaginous,\r\nconfluent with the cap but of a different texture, hollow or stuffed.\r\nThe veil is absent or sometimes small traces may be seen attached to the\r\nrim of the pileus, in young plants in the form of flakes. The spores are\r\nof various shades of brown, dull or bright. They grow on the ground on\r\nlawns and rich pastures. Some on wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Naucoria hamadryas. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE NYMPH NAUCORIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nHamadryas, one of the nymphs whose life depended upon the tree to which\r\nshe was attached.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one to two inches broad, rather fleshy, convex, expanded,\r\ngibbous, even, bay-ferruginous when young and moist, pale yellowish when\r\nold.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attenuated, adnexed, almost free, rusty, slightly\r\nventricose, somewhat crowded.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow, equal, fragile, smooth, pallid, two to three inches\r\nlong. The spores are elliptical, rust-color, 13-14×7µ.\r\n\r\nThis is quite a common species, often growing alone along pavements,\r\nunder shade trees, and in the woods. The caps only are good. Found from\r\nJune to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Naucoria pediades. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE TAN-COLORED NAUCORIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 228.--Naucoria pediades. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nPediades is from a Greek word meaning a plain or a field, referring to\r\nits being found on lawns and pastures.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is somewhat fleshy, convex, then plane, obtuse or depressed,\r\ndry, finally opaque, frequently inclined to be minutely rivulose.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem but not adnate to it, broad,\r\nsubdistant, only a few entire brownish, then a dingy cinnamon.\r\n\r\nThe stem is pithy or stuffed, rather wavy and silky, yellowish, base\r\nslightly bulbous. The spores are of a brownish-rust color, 10-12×4-5µ.\r\n\r\nIf the small bulb at the base of the stem is examined, it will be found\r\nto be formed chiefly of mycelium rolled together around the base. It is\r\nfound on lawns and richly manured pastures from May to November. Use\r\nonly the caps. This plant is usually known as semiorbicularis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Naucoria paludosella. Atkinson n. sp._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXXIII. Figure 229.--Naucoria paludosella.\r\n\r\nShowing mode of growth, clay-brown scales on the caps.]\r\n\r\nPaludosella is a diminutive of _palus_, gen. paludis, a swamp or marsh.\r\n\r\nPlants six to eight cm. high; pileus two and a half to three cm. broad;\r\nstem three to four mm. thick.\r\n\r\nPileus viscid when moist, convex to expanded, in age somewhat depressed;\r\nclay color, darker over center, often with appressed clay brown scales\r\nwith a darker color.\r\n\r\nGills raw umber to Mars brown (R), emarginate, adnate sometimes with a\r\ndecurrent tooth, easily becoming free.\r\n\r\nCystidia on sides of gills none, edge of gills with large, hyaline,\r\nthin-walled cells, subventricose, sometimes nearly cylindrical,\r\nabruptly narrowed at each end with a slight sinus around the middle.\r\n\r\nSpores subovate to subelliptical, subinequilateral, smooth, 7-9×4-5µ,\r\nfuscous ferruginous, dull ochraceous under microscope.\r\n\r\nStem same color as pileus but paler, cartilaginous; floccose from loose\r\nthreads or, in some cases, abundant threads over the surface; becoming\r\nhollow, base bulbous, the extreme base covered with whitish mycelium.\r\n\r\nVeil rather thick, floccose, disappearing, leaving remnant on stem and\r\nmargin of pileus when fresh. _Atkinson._\r\n\r\nDr. Kellerman and I found this plant growing on living sphagnum, other\r\nmosses and on rotten wood on Cranberry Island, in Buckeye Lake, Ohio.\r\nFigure 229 will illustrate its mode of growth, and the older plant with\r\nupturned cap will show the conspicuous clay-brown scales of the pileus.\r\nThe plants are found in September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Flammula. Fr._\r\n\r\nFlammula means a small flame; so called because many of the species have\r\nbright colors. The spores are ferruginous, sometimes light yellow. The\r\ncap is fleshy and at first usually inrolled, bright colored; veil\r\nfilamentous, often wanting. The gills are decurrent or attached with a\r\ntooth. The stem is fleshy, fibrous, and of the same character as the\r\ncap.\r\n\r\nThe species of the Flammula are mostly found on wood. A few are found on\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Flammula flavida. Schaeff._\r\n\r\nTHE YELLOW FLAMMULA.\r\n\r\nFlavida means yellow.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, convex, expanded, plane, equal smooth, moist,\r\nmargin at first inrolled.\r\n\r\nThe gills are firmly attached to the stem, yellow, turning slightly\r\nferruginous.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stuffed, somewhat hollow, fibrillose, yellow, ferruginous at\r\nthe base.\r\n\r\nThese plants are of a showy yellow, and are frequently found in our\r\nwoods on decayed logs. They are found in July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Flammula carbonaria. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE VISCID FLAMMULA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 230.--Flammula carbonaria.]\r\n\r\nCarbonaria is so called because it is found on charcoal or burned earth.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is quite fleshy, tawny-yellow, at first convex, then becoming\r\nplane, even, thin, viscid, margin of the cap at first inrolled, flesh\r\nyellow.\r\n\r\nThe gills are firmly attached to the stem, clay-colored or brown,\r\nmoderately close.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stuffed or nearly hollow, slender, rigid, squamulose,\r\npallid, quite short.\r\n\r\nThe spores are ferruginous-brown, elliptical, 7×3.5µ.\r\n\r\nI have found this species quite frequently where an old stump had been\r\nburned out. It is gregarious. I have only found it from September to\r\nNovember but the specimens in Figure 230 were sent to me in May, from\r\nBoston. They were found in great abundance in Purgatory Swamp, where the\r\ngrass and vegetation had been burned away.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Flammula fusus. Batsch._\r\n\r\nFusus means a spindle; so called from the spindle-shaped stem.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is compact, convex, then expanded, even, rather viscid,\r\nreddish-tan, flesh yellowish.\r\n\r\nThe gills are somewhat decurrent, pallid yellow, becoming ferruginous.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stuffed, firm, colored like the pileus, fibrillose, striate,\r\nattenuated and somewhat fusiform, rooting. The spores are broadly\r\nelliptical, 10×4µ.\r\n\r\nFound on well-decayed logs or on ground made up largely of decayed wood.\r\nFound from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Flammula fillius. Fr._\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to three inches broad, even, smooth, with rather\r\nviscid cuticle, pale orange-red with the disc reddish.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, arcuate, rather crowded, white, then\r\npallid or tawny-yellow.\r\n\r\nThe stem is three to five inches long, hollow, smooth, pallid, reddish\r\nwithin. The spores are elliptical, 10×5µ.\r\n\r\nFound on the ground in the woods from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Flammula squalida. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 231.--Flammula squalida.]\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one to one and a half inches broad, fleshy, convex, or\r\nplane, firm, viscose, glabrous, dingy-yellowish or rufescent, flesh\r\nwhitish but in color similar to the pileus under the separate cuticle.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rather broad, adnate, pallid, becoming dark ferruginous.\r\n\r\nThe stem is one and a half to three inches long, one to two lines thick,\r\nslender, generally flexuose, hollow fibrillose, pallid or brownish,\r\npale-yellow at the top when young; spores are brownish-ferruginous,\r\n.0003 inch long, .00016 broad. _Peck._\r\n\r\nIt is found in bushy and swampy places. Dr. Peck says it is closely\r\nrelated to F. spumosa. Its dingy appearance, slender habit, more uniform\r\nand darker color of the pileus, and darker color of the lamellæ. It\r\ngrows in groups. The plant in Figure 231 was found in Purgatory Swamp,\r\nby Mrs. Blackford. Found in August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paxillus. Fr._\r\n\r\nPaxillus means a small stake or peg. The spores as well as the entire\r\nplant are ferruginous. The pileus, with an involute margin, gradually\r\nunfolds. It may be symmetrical or eccentric. The stem is continuous with\r\nthe hymenophore. The gills are tough, soft, persistent, decurrent,\r\nbranching, membranaceous, usually easily separating from the\r\nhymenophore.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive features of this genus are the involute margin and the\r\nsoft, tough, and decurrent gills which are easily separable from the\r\nhymenophore. Some grow on the ground, others grow on stumps and sawdust.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paxillus involutus. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 232.--Paxillus involutus.]\r\n\r\nInvolutus means rolled inward. The pileus is two to four inches broad,\r\nfleshy, compact, convex, plane, then depressed; viscid when moist, the\r\ncap being covered with a fine downy substance, so that when the margin\r\nof the cap unrolls the marks of the gills are quite prominent; yellowish\r\nor tawny-ochraceous, spotting when bruised.\r\n\r\nThe gills are decurrent, branched; anastomosing behind, near the stem;\r\neasily separating from the hymenophore.\r\n\r\nThe stem is paler than the pileus, fleshy, solid, firm, thickened\r\nupward, brown spotted.\r\n\r\nThe flesh is yellowish, changing to reddish or brownish when bruised.\r\nThe spores are rust-colored and elliptical, 8-10µ. It is found on the\r\nground and decayed stumps. When found on the side of a decayed stump or\r\na moss-covered log the stem is usually eccentric, but in other cases it\r\nis generally central.\r\n\r\nIt will be found around swampy places in an open woods. I found quite\r\nlarge specimens around a swamp in Mr. Shriver's woods near Chillicothe,\r\nbut they were too far gone to photograph. It is edible but coarse. It\r\nappears from August to November. Some authors call it the Brown\r\nChantarelle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paxillus atrotomentosus. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 233.--Paxillus atrotomentosus.]\r\n\r\nAtrotomentosus is from _ater_, black, and _tomentum_, woolly or downy.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is three to six inches broad, rust-color or reddish-brown,\r\ncompactly fleshy, eccentric, convex then plane or depressed, margin\r\nthin, frequently minutely rivulose, sometimes tomentose in the center,\r\nflesh white, tinged with brown under the cuticle.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, slightly decurrent, crowded,\r\nbranched at the base, yellowish-tawny, interspaces venose.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three inches long, stout, solid, elastic, eccentric\r\nor lateral, rooting, covered except at the apex with a dark-brown\r\nvelvety down. The spores are elliptical, 5-6×3-4µ.\r\n\r\nI found the specimen in Figure 233 at the foot of an old pine tree on\r\nhillside at Sugar Grove, Ohio. I found the plant frequently at Salem,\r\nOhio. It grows where the pine tree is a native. It is not poisonous. I\r\ndo not regard it as very good. Found during August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paxillus rhodoxanthus. Schw._\r\n\r\nTHE YELLOW PAXILLUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 234.--Paxillus rhodoxanthus. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize. Cap reddish-yellow or chestnut-brown. Gills yellow.]\r\n\r\nRhodoxanthus means a yellow rose. The pileus is one to two inches broad,\r\nconvex, then expanded, cushion-shaped, the epidermis of the cap often\r\ncracked showing the yellow flesh, resembling very much Boletus\r\nsubtomentosus; reddish-yellow or chestnut-brown. The flesh is yellow and\r\nthe cap dry.\r\n\r\nThe gills are decurrent, somewhat distant, stout, chrome yellow,\r\noccasionally forked at the base; anastomosing veins quite prominent, the\r\ncystidia being very noticeable.\r\n\r\nThe stem is firm, stout, of the same color as the cap, perhaps paler and\r\nmore yellow at the base. The spores are oblong, yellow, 8-12×3-5µ.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most troublesome plants whose genus we have to\r\nsettle. One of my mycological friends advised me to omit it from the\r\ngenus altogether. It has been placed in various genera, but I have\r\nfollowed Prof. Atkinson and classed it under Paxillus. The plant is\r\nwidely distributed. I find it frequently about Chillicothe. It is\r\nedible. Found in August, September and October. A full discussion of the\r\nplant will be found in Prof. Atkinson's book.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cortinarius. Fr._\r\n\r\nCortinarius is from _cortina_, a curtain, alluding to a cobwebby veil\r\nseen only in the comparatively young plants. Sometimes, parts of it will\r\nseem more substantial, remaining for a time on the margin of the cap or\r\non the stem. The color of the pileus varies and its flesh and that of\r\nthe stem are continuous. The hymenophore and the gills are continuous.\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, frequently notched, membranaceous,\r\npersistent, changing color, dry, powdery, with rusty-yellow spores which\r\ndrop slowly. The veil and gills are the chief marks of distinction. The\r\nformer is gossamer-like and separate from the cuticle, and the latter\r\nare always powdered. It is always essential to note the color of the\r\ngills in the young plant, since color is variable and sometimes shows\r\nonly the slightest trace on the stem, colored from the falling spores.\r\n\r\nMost authorities divide the genus into six tribes, from the appearance\r\nof the pileus. They are as follows:\r\n\r\nI. Phlegmacium, meaning a shiny or clammy moisture. The pileus has a\r\ncontinuous pellicle, viscid when moist, stem dry, veil spider-webby.\r\n\r\nII. Myxacium, meaning mucus, slime; so called from the glutinous veil.\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, glutinous, rather thin; the gills are attached to\r\nthe stem, slightly decurrent; the stem is viscid, polished when dry,\r\nslightly bulbous.\r\n\r\nIII. Inoloma, meaning a fibrous fringe; from _is_, genitive _inos_, a\r\nfibre; and _loma_, a fringe.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, dry, not hygrophanous or viscid, silky with innate\r\nscales; the gills may be violaceous, pinkish-brown, yellow at first,\r\nthen in all cases cinnamon-color from the spores; the stem is fleshy and\r\nsomewhat bulbous; veil simple.\r\n\r\nIV. Dermocybe, meaning a skinhead; from _derma_, skin, and _cybe_, a\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nThe pileus thin and fleshy, entirely dry, at first clothed with silky\r\ndown, becoming smooth in mature plants. The gills are changeable in\r\ncolor. The stem is equal or tapering downward, stuffed, sometimes\r\nhollow, smooth.\r\n\r\nV. Telamonia, meaning a bandage or lint. The pileus is moist, watery,\r\nsmooth or sprinkled with whitish superficial fibres, the remnants of the\r\nweb-like veil. The flesh is thin, somewhat thicker at the center. The\r\nstem is ringed and frequently scaly from the universal veil, slightly\r\nveiled at the apex, hence almost with a double veil. The plants are\r\nusually quite large.\r\n\r\nVI. Hydrocybe, meaning water-head or moist head. The pileus is moist,\r\nnot viscid, smooth or sprinkled with a whitish superficial fibril, flesh\r\nchanging color when dry, and rather thin. The stem is somewhat rigid and\r\nbare. Veil thin, fibrillose, rarely forming a ring. Gills also thin.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIBE I. PHLEGMACIUM.\r\n\r\n_Cortinarius purpurascens. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE PURPLISH CORTINARIUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nPurpurascens means becoming purple or purplish; so named because the\r\nblue gills become purple when bruised.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is four to five inches broad, bay-brown, viscid, compact,\r\nwavy, spotted when old; often depressed at the margin, sometimes bending\r\nback; the flesh blue.\r\n\r\nThe gills are broadly notched, crowded, bluish-tan, then cinnamon-color,\r\nbecoming purplish when bruised.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, bulbous, clothed with small fibres, blue, very\r\ncompact, juicy; becoming purplish when rubbed. The spores are\r\nelliptical, 10-12×5-6µ.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the delicious mushrooms to eat, the stem cooking tender\r\nas readily as the caps. I found it in Tolerton's woods, Salem, Ohio, and\r\nin Poke Hollow near Chillicothe. September to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cortinarius turmalis. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE YELLOW-TAN CORTINARIUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nTurmalis means of or belonging to a troop or a squadron, turma; so\r\ncalled because occurring in groups, and not solitary.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to four inches broad, viscid when wet,\r\nochraceous-yellow, smooth, discoid, flesh soft; veil extending from the\r\nmargin of the cap to the stem in delicate arachnoid threads, best seen\r\nin young plants.\r\n\r\nThe gills are emarginate, decurrent, depending upon the age of the\r\nplant; crowded, somewhat serrated, whitish at first, then\r\nbrownish-ochraceous-yellow. The remnants of the veil will usually show\r\nabove the middle of the stem as a zone of minute striæ, darker than the\r\nstem.\r\n\r\nI found specimens on Cemetery Hill under pine trees. September to\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cortinarius olivaceo-stramineus. Kauff. n. Sp._\r\n\r\nOlivaceo-stramineus means an olive straw-color.\r\n\r\nPileus 4-7 cm. broad, viscid from a glutinous cuticle, broadly convex,\r\nslightly depressed in the center when expanded; margin incurved for some\r\ntime; pale-yellow with an olivaceous tinge, slightly rufous-tinged when\r\nold; smooth or silky-fibrillose, disk sometimes covered with minute\r\nsquamules, shreds of the partial veil attached to the margin when\r\nexpanded. Flesh very thick, becoming abruptly thin toward the margin,\r\nwhite, dingy-yellowish in age, soon soft and spongy. Gills rather\r\nnarrow, 7 mm. broad, sinuate-adnexed, whitish at first, then pale\r\ncinnamon, crowded, edge serratulate and paler. Stem 6-8 cm. long, with\r\na slight bulb when young, from whose margin arises the dense partial\r\nveil; white and very pruinate above the veil, which remains as dingy\r\nfibrils stained by the spores; spongy and soft within, becoming somewhat\r\nhollow. Veil white with an olive tinge. Spores, 10-12×5.5-6.5µ,\r\ngranular within, almost smooth. Odor agreeable.\r\n\r\nKauffman says this resembles C. herpeticus, except that the gills when\r\nyoung are never violet-tinged.\r\n\r\nI found this plant in Poke Hollow, near Chillicothe. It was unknown to\r\nme and I sent it to Dr. Kauffman of Michigan University to determine. I\r\nfound it under beech trees, during October and November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cortinarius varius. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE VARIABLE CORTINARIUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n_Varius--Variable_, so called because it varies in stature, its color\r\nand habit are unchangeable. The pileus is about two inches broad;\r\ncompact, hemispherical, then expanded; regular, slightly viscid, thin\r\nmargin at first incurved, sometimes with fragments of the web-like veil\r\nadhering.\r\n\r\nThe gills are notched, thin, crowded, quite entire, purplish, at length\r\nclay-colored or cinnamon.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, short, covered with threads, whitish, bulbous, from\r\none and a half to two and a half inches long.\r\n\r\nThe plant is quite variable in size but constant in color. It is found\r\nin woods. I found specimens at Salem, Ohio, and at Bowling Green, Ohio.\r\nSeptember to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cortinarius cærulescens. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE AZURE-BLUE CORTINARIUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nCærulescens, azure-blue. Pileus fleshy, convex, expanded, even, viscid,\r\nazure-blue, flesh soft, not changing color when bruised.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, slightly rounded behind, crowded,\r\nquite entire, at first of a pure dark blue, then rusty from the spores.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, attenuated upward, firm, bright violet, becoming\r\npale, whitish, bulb growing less with age, fibrillose from vein. Spores\r\nelliptical. Neither the flesh nor the gills change color when bruised.\r\nThis fact distinguishes it from C. purpurascens. When young the entire\r\nplant is more or less blue, or bluish-purple, and the color never\r\nentirely leaves the plant. In age it becomes somewhat spotted with\r\nyellow. The flesh is a little tough and needs to be stewed for some\r\ntime. Found in Whinnery's woods, Salem, Ohio. September to October.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIBE II. MYXACIUM.\r\n\r\n_Cortinarius collinitus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE SMEARED CORTINARIUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 235.--Cortinarius collinitus. One-half natural\r\nsize. Caps purplish-brown, also showing veil.]\r\n\r\nCollinitus means smeared. The pileus is at first hemispherical, convex,\r\nthen expanded, obtuse; smooth, even, glutinous, shining when dry;\r\npurplish when young, later brownish; at first incurved.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, rather broad, dingy-white or\r\ngrayish-tan when young, then cinnamon.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, cylindrical, viscid or glutinous when moist,\r\ntransversely cracking when dry, whitish or paler than the cap. The\r\nspores are elliptical, 12×6µ. I found this species in Tolerton's woods,\r\nSalem, Ohio, St. John's woods, Bowling Green, Ohio, also on Ralston's\r\nRun near Chillicothe, where the specimens in Figure 235 were found. Both\r\ncap and stem are covered with a thick gluten. They grow, with us, in\r\nwoods among leaves. The young plant has a development peculiar to\r\nitself. The cap varies greatly in color. The flesh is white or whitish.\r\nThe peculiar bluish-white gills of the young plant will attract\r\nattention at once. It is found from September to November.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIBE III. INOLOMA.\r\n\r\n_Cortinarius autumnalis. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE FALL CORTINARIUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 236.--Cortinarius autumnalis. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize. Cap a dull rusty-yellow, also showing bulbous stem.]\r\n\r\nAutumnalis pertaining to fall. The pileus is fleshy, convex or expanded,\r\ndull rusty-yellow, variegated, or streaked with innate rust-colored\r\nfibrils.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rather broad, with a wide, shallow emargination.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal, solid, firm, bulbous, a little paler than the pileus.\r\n\r\nThe height is three to four inches, breadth of pileus two to four\r\ninches. _Peck._\r\n\r\nThe plant was named by Dr. Peck because it was found late in the fall. I\r\nfound the plant on several occasions in September, 1905. It grew very\r\nsparingly in a mixed woods on a north hillside.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cortinarius alboviolaceus. Pers._\r\n\r\nTHE LIGHT VIOLET CORTINARIUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 237.--Cortinarius alboviolaceus. The caps are\r\nviolet.]\r\n\r\nAlboviolaceus means whitish-violet.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to three inches broad, fleshy, rather thin, convex,\r\nthen expanded, sometimes broadly subumbonate; smooth, silky, whitish,\r\ntinged with lilac or pale violet.\r\n\r\nThe gills are generally serrulate, whitish-violet, then cinnamon-color.\r\n\r\nThe stem is three to four inches long, equal or tapering upward, solid,\r\nsilky, white, stained with violet, especially at the top, slightly\r\nbulbous, the bulb gradually tapering into the stem. Spores, 12×5-6µ.\r\n_Peck's_ Report.\r\n\r\nSometimes the stem has a median ring-like zone, being violet above the\r\nzone and white below. The spider-like veil shows very plainly in the\r\nspecimen on the left in Figure 237. In the plant on the right is shown\r\nthe tapering stem from the base to the apex. These plants were found in\r\nPoke Hollow, September 21st. They are quite abundant there and elsewhere\r\nabout Chillicothe. They are very good but not equal in flavor to C.\r\nviolaceus. They are found in mixed woods. September to frost.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cortinarius lilacinus. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE LILAC-COLORED CORTINARIUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to three inches broad, firm, hemispherical, then\r\nconvex, minutely silky, lilac-color.\r\n\r\nThe gills are close, lilac, then cinnamon.\r\n\r\nThe stem is four to five inches long, stout, bulbous, silky-fibrillose,\r\nsolid, whitish, tinged with lilac. Spores nucleate, 10×6µ. _Peck._\r\n\r\nI have found this plant in but one place near Chillicothe. In Poke\r\nHollow on a north hillside I have found a number of rare specimens. All\r\nwere identified by Dr. Kauffman of Michigan University. All were found\r\nunder beech trees within a very small radius. September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cortinarius bolaris. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE COLLARED CORTINARIUS.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, obsoletely umbonate, growing pale, variegated with\r\nsaffron-red, adpressed, innate, pilose scales.\r\n\r\nThe gills are subdecurrent, crowded, watery cinnamon.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three inches long, at first stuffed, then hollow,\r\nnearly equal, squamose.\r\n\r\nFound under beech trees. Only occasionally found here.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cortinarius violaceus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE VIOLET CORTINARIUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 238.--Cortinarius violaceus. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize. Caps dark violet. Stems bulbous. Gills violet.]\r\n\r\nViolaceus, violet color. The pileus is convex, becoming nearly plane,\r\ndry, adorned with numerous persistent hairy tufts or scales; dark\r\nviolet.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rather thick, distant, rounded, or deeply notched at the\r\ninner extremity; colored like the pileus in the young plant,\r\nbrownish-cinnamon in the mature plant.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, clothed with small fibres; bulbous, colored like the\r\npileus. The spores are slightly elliptical.\r\n\r\nThe Violet Cortinarius is a very beautiful mushroom and one easy of\r\nrecognition. At first the whole plant is uniformly colored, but with age\r\nthe gills assume a dingy ochraceous or brownish-cinnamon hue. The cap is\r\ngenerally well formed and regular, and is beautifully adorned with\r\nlittle hairy scales or tufts. These are rarely shown in figures of the\r\nEuropean plant, but they are quite noticeable in the American plant,\r\nand should not be overlooked. The flesh is more or less tinged with\r\nviolet. _Peck._ 50th Rep. N. Y. State Bot.\r\n\r\nNo one can fail to recognize this plant. The web-like veil in the young\r\nplant, the bulbous stem, and the violet tinge throughout will readily\r\ndistinguish it. It grows in rich hilly country. It grows solitary, and\r\nin open woods.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIBE IV. DERMOCYBE.\r\n\r\n_Cortinarius cinnamoneus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE CINNAMON CORTINARIUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 239.--Cortinarius cinnamoneus. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize. Caps cinnamon-brown. Stems yellow.]\r\n\r\nThe pileus is thin, convex, nearly expanded, sometimes nearly plane,\r\nsometimes slightly umbonate, sometimes the pileus is abruptly bent\r\ndownward; dry, fibrillose at least when young, often with concentric\r\nrows of scales on the margin, cinnamon-brown, flesh yellowish.\r\n\r\nThe gills are thin, close, firmly attached to the stem, slightly\r\nnotched, decurrent with a tooth, becoming easily separated from the\r\nstem, shining, yellowish, then tawny-yellow.\r\n\r\nThe stem is slender, equal, stuffed or hollow, thin, clothed with small\r\nfibres, yellow, as is also the flesh. The spores are elliptical. This\r\nplant is so called because of its color, the entire plant being of a\r\ncinnamon-color. Sometimes there are cinnabar stains on the pileus. It\r\nseems to grow best under pine trees, but I have found it in mixed woods.\r\nMy attention was called to it by the little Bohemian boys picking it\r\nwhen they had been in this country but a few days and could not speak a\r\nword of English. It is evidently like the European species. There is\r\nalso a Cortinarius that has blood-red gills. It is var. semi-sanguineus,\r\nFr. July to October.\r\n\r\nThe plants in Figure 239 were found on Cemetery Hill, Chillicothe, O.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cortinarius ochroleucus.

Two-thirds natural\r\nsize, showing veil and bulbous form of stem.]\r\n\r\nOchroleucus, meaning yellowish and white, because of the color of the\r\ncap. The pileus is an inch to two and a half inches broad, fleshy;\r\nconvex, sometimes somewhat depressed in the center, often remaining\r\nconvex; dry; on the center finely tomentose to minutely scaly, sometimes\r\nthe scales are arranged in concentric rows around the cap; quite fleshy\r\nat the center, thinning out toward the margin; the color is a creamy to\r\na deep-buff, considerably darker at the center.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached to the stem, clearly notched, somewhat\r\nventricose; in mature plants, somewhat crowded, not entire, many short\r\nones, pale first, then clay-colored ochre.\r\n\r\nThe stem is three inches long, solid, firm, often bulbous, tapering\r\nupward, often becoming hollow, a creamy-buff.\r\n\r\nThe veil, quite beautiful and strongly persistent, forms a cortina of\r\nthe same color as the cap but becoming discolored by the falling of the\r\nspores. In Figure 240 the cortina and the bulbous form of the stem will\r\nbe seen.\r\n\r\nFound along Ralston's Run. In beech woods from September to November.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 241.--Cortinarius ochroleucus. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize, showing the developed plant.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTRIBE V.

Morris, Ellis, Mass.\r\n\r\nPileus fleshy, except the thin and at length reflexed margin; convex,\r\nirregular, hygrophanous, ochraceous or tawny-ochraceous; flesh thin,\r\ncolored like the pileus; odor weak, like that of radishes.\r\n\r\nThe gills are broad, subdistant, eroded or uneven on the edge; rounded\r\nbehind, adnexed, pale-yellow when young, becoming darker with age.\r\n\r\nThe stem is nearly equal, fibrillose, solid, whitish or pale-yellow and\r\nsilky at the top, colored like the pileus below and fibrillose;\r\nirregularly striate and subreticulate, the double veil whitish or\r\nyellowish-white and sometimes forming an imperfect annulus.\r\n\r\nThe spores are tawny-ochraceous, subglobose or broadly elliptic,\r\nnucleate, 8-10µ long, 6-7µ broad. _Peck._\r\n\r\nPileus 3-10 cm. broad; stem 7-10 cm. long, 1-2 cm. thick.\r\n\r\nThey require moist and shady places and the presence of hemlock trees.\r\nThey are found from August to October. The plants in Figure 242 were\r\nfound near Boston by Mrs. E. B. Blackford.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cortinarius armillatus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE RED-ZONED CORTINARIUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 243.--Cortinarius armillatus. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize, showing the rings on the stem.]\r\n\r\nArmillatus means ringed; so called because the stem is banded with one\r\nor more rings, or red bands. The pileus is two to four inches broad,\r\nfleshy, not compact, bell-shaped, then expanded, soon innately\r\nfibrillose and torn into scales, smooth when young, reddish-brick-color,\r\nmargin thin, flesh dingy-pallid.\r\n\r\nThe gills are very broad, distant, adnate, slightly rounded, pallid,\r\nthen dark-cinnamon.\r\n\r\nThe stem is fairly long, solid, bulbous, whitish, with two or three red\r\nzones, somewhat fibrillose. The spores 10×6µ.\r\n\r\nThis is a very large and beautiful Cortinarius and it has such a number\r\nof striking ear marks that it can be easily recognized. The thin and\r\ngenerally uneven margin of the pileus and the one to four red bands\r\naround the stem, the upper one being the brightest, will distinguish\r\nthis species from all others. It is found in the woods in September and\r\nOctober. In quite young specimens the collector will notice two well\r\ndefined arachnoid veils, the lower one being much more dense. Prof.\r\nFries speaks of them as follows: \"Exterior veil woven, red, arranged in\r\n2-4 distant cinnabar zones encircling the stem; partial veil continuous\r\nwith the upper zone, arachnoid, reddish-white.\" The specimens in Figure\r\n243 were collected in Michigan and photographed by Dr. Fischer of\r\nDetroit. A number of this species form a prize for the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cortinarius Atkinsonianus. Kauff._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 244.--Cortinarius Atkinsonianus. Caps waxy-yellow,\r\nbulbous stem, spider-like veil.]\r\n\r\nAtkinsonianus is named in honor of Prof. Geo. F. Atkinson.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is 8 cm. broad, expanded, _wax-yellow_ or _gallstone-yellow_\r\nto _clay-colored and tawny_ (Ridg.), colors very striking and sometimes\r\nseveral present at once; viscid, smooth, even, somewhat shining when\r\ndry. Flesh thick, except at margin, bluish-white like the stem, or\r\npaler, scarcely or not at all changing when bruised.\r\n\r\nThe gills are comparatively narrow, 6-8 mm., width uniform except near\r\nouter end, adnate, becoming slightly sinuate, _purplish_ to yellow, then\r\ncinnamon.\r\n\r\nThe stem is _violaceus-blue_, 8 cm. long, 12-15 mm. thick, equal or\r\nslightly tapering upward, bulbous by a rather thick, marginate bulb 3\r\ncm. thick, hung with fibrillose threads of the universal veil, which is\r\na beautiful pale-yellow and clothes the bulb even at maturity;\r\nviolaceous-blue within, solid. Spores 13-15µ×7-8.5µ, _very\r\ntubercular_. _Kauff._\r\n\r\nThe specimens in Figure 244 were found in Poke Hollow near Chillicothe.\r\nI have found them on several occasions. They are edible and of very good\r\nflavor. Found from September to frost. The specimens illustrate the\r\nspider-like veil that gives rise to the genus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cortinarius umidicola. Kauff._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 245.--Cortinarius umidicola. One-half natural\r\nsize. Caps pinkish-buff.]\r\n\r\nUmidicola means dwelling in moist places. Pileus as much as 16 cm. broad\r\n(generally 6-7 cm. when expanded), hemispherical, then convex and\r\nexpanded, with the margin for a long time markedly incurved; young cap\r\nheliotrope-purplish with umber on disk, or somewhat fawn-colored, fading\r\nvery quickly to pinkish-buff, in which condition it is usually found;\r\nmargin when young with narrow strips of silky fibrils from the\r\nuniversal veil; pileus when old covered with innate, whitish, silky\r\nfibrils, hygrophanous; surface punctuate, even when young. Flesh of stem\r\nand pileus lavender when young but soon fading to a sordid white, thick\r\non disk, abruptly thin towards margin, soon cavernous from grubs. The\r\ngills are very broad, as much as 2 cm.; at first lavender, soon very\r\npale-tan to cinnamon; rather distant, thick, emarginate with a tooth; at\r\nfirst plane, then ventricose; edge slightly serratulate, concolorous.\r\nStem as much as 13 cm. long (usually 8 to 10 cm.), 1-2 cm. thick,\r\nusually thickened below and tapering slightly upwards, mostly thicker\r\nalso at apex, rarely attenuate at the base, sometimes curved, always\r\nstout, solid, lavender above the woven, sordid white, universal veil,\r\nwhich at first covers the lower part as a sheath, but soon breaks up so\r\nas to leave a band-like annulus half way or lower down on the stem. The\r\nannulus is soon rubbed off, leaving a bare stem. Cortina\r\nviolaceous-white. Spores 7-9×5-6, almost smooth. _Kauffman._\r\n\r\nThe specimens in Figure 245 were gathered at Detroit, Michigan, and\r\nphotographed by Dr. Fischer.

Two-thirds natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\n_Campestris, from campus, a field._ This is perhaps the widest known of\r\nall mushrooms, familiarly known as the \"Pink-gilled mushroom.\" It is the\r\nspecies found in the markets. It is the only species which is sure to\r\nrespond to the methods of cultivation.\r\n\r\nIt is the same species which is bought in cans at the store.\r\n\r\nIn very young plants the pileus is somewhat globular, as will be seen in\r\nthe small plants in the front row in Figure 248. The edge is connected\r\nwith the stem by the veil; then round convex, then expanding, becoming\r\nalmost flat; surface dry, downy, even, quite scaly, varying in color\r\nfrom creamy-white to a light-brown; margin extending beyond the gills,\r\nas will be seen in Figure 249 in the one on the extreme right.\r\n\r\nThe gills, when first revealed by the separation of the veil, are of a\r\ndelicate pink hue, but with advancing age this generally deepens to a\r\ndark-brown or blackish-brown color.\r\n\r\nThe stem is rather short, nearly equal, white or whitish; the substance\r\nin the center is more spongy than the exterior, hence it is said to be\r\nstuffed. Sometimes the collar shrivels so much that it is scarcely\r\nperceptible, and may disappear altogether in old plants. The spores are\r\nbrown in mass. The cap of this mushroom is from three to four inches in\r\ndiameter and the stem from one to three inches long.\r\n\r\nThis is the first mushroom that yielded to cultivation. It is raised in\r\nlarge quantities, not only in this country, but especially in France,\r\nJapan, and China. No doubt other species and genera will be produced in\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThis species grows in grassy places, in pastures, and richly manured\r\ngrounds, never in the woods. I found it in great abundance in Wood\r\nCounty, in fields which had never been plowed and where the ground was\r\nunusually rich. There it seemed to grow in groups or large clusters.\r\nUsually it is found singly. Found from August to October. The plants\r\nfigured here were found near Chillicothe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 249.--Agaricus campestris. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Agaricus Rodmani.

The mature\r\nspecimens frequently have the surface of the cap broken into large,\r\nbrownish scales.\r\n\r\nThe gills are whitish, then pink, becoming dark-brown; narrow, close and\r\nunequal.\r\n\r\nThe stem is fleshy, solid, short, thick, about two inches long. The\r\ncollar when well developed exhibits a striking characteristic. It\r\nappears as if there were two collars with a space between them. Its\r\nspores are broadly elliptical, .0002 to .00025 inch long.\r\n\r\nIt may be easily distinguished from the common Agaric by the time when\r\nfound, its thick firm flesh, its narrow gills, which are almost white at\r\nfirst, and its double collar. I have found people eating it, supposing\r\nthey were eating the common mushroom.\r\n\r\nIt is found in grassy places and especially between the cobble stones\r\nalong the gutters in the cities. The specimens in Figure 250 were found\r\nin Chillicothe in the gutters. It is a meaty plant and one can soon tell\r\nit from its weight alone. It is found through May and June. It is fully\r\nas good to eat as the common mushroom. Macadam speaks of finding it in\r\nthe fall, but I have never succeeded in finding it later than June.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Agaricus silvicola.

Spores elliptical,\r\n6-8×4-5. The plant is four to six inches high. Pileus three to six\r\ninches broad. _Peck._ 36th N. Y. State Bot.\r\n\r\nA. silvicola is very closely related to the common mushroom. Its chief\r\ndifferences are in its place of growth, its being slender, and its\r\nhollow stem somewhat bulbous at the base. I have found it many times in\r\nthe woods about Chillicothe, although I have never succeeded in finding\r\nmore than one or two at a time. I have always put them with edible\r\nspecies and have eaten them when thus cooked with others.\r\n\r\nBecause of the resemblance which it bears, in its earlier stages, to the\r\ndeadly Amanita, one can not exercise too great care in identifying it.\r\nIt grows in the woods and is found from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Agaricus arvensis.

The\r\ngills are crowded, free, generally broader toward the stem; at first\r\nwhitish, then pinkish, finally black-brown.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stout, equal, slightly thickened at the base, smooth, hollow\r\nor stuffed, ring rather large and thick, the upper part membranaceous\r\nand white, while the lower or exterior surface is thicker, downy,\r\nradically split and yellowish.\r\n\r\nThe spores are elliptical, .0003 to .0004 inch long.\r\n\r\nThis plant grows much larger than the common mushroom, and may be\r\ndistinguished by the collar being composed of two parts closely allied\r\nto each other making a double membrane, the lower part being much\r\nthicker, softer in texture and split in a stellate manner into broad and\r\nyellow rays, as will be seen in Figure 252.\r\n\r\nI found it very plentiful in Wood County, Ohio, and in quantities in Dr.\r\nManville's yard in Bowling Green, Ohio. I ate them frequently and gave\r\nthem to my friends, who all voted them delicious.\r\n\r\nWhen the stem is first cut there exudes from the wound a yellowish\r\nliquid which is quite a sure ear mark of this species.\r\n\r\nThere is a tradition that the spores will not germinate unless they pass\r\nthrough the alimentary canal of the horse or some animal. However this\r\nmay be, it is found frequently where no trace of the horse can be found.\r\nIt appears from July to September. I have found it in Fayette County,\r\nOhio, in large rings, resembling the Fairy-Ring Mushroom, only the ring\r\nis very large, as well as the mushrooms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXXIV.

The beginner will have some trouble\r\nto distinguish it from A. silvicola. This species, like the A.\r\nsilvicola, is closely related to the meadow mushroom, but can be readily\r\nseparated from it. This, too, like the A. silvicola, when seen in the\r\nwoods at a distance, resembles the Amanita, but a careful glance at the\r\ngills will detect the difference.\r\n\r\nThe gills of the very young plant may appear white, but they will soon\r\ndevelop a pinkish tinge which will distinguish it from the Amanita. It\r\nis found in thin woods from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Agaricus comptulus. Fr._\r\n\r\nComptulus means beautified or luxuriously decked; so called from the\r\nsilky lustre of its cap.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is at first convex, then expanded, rather fleshy, thinner at\r\nthe margin and incurved, usually with an adpressed silky finish to the\r\nsurface of the cap which gives rise to its specific name.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free, much rounded toward the margin and the stem, white\r\nat first, then grayish, pinkish, purple-brown in old plants.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow, tapering from the base to the cap, slight bulbous,\r\nwhite, then yellowish, fleshy, fibrous. The veil is more delicate than\r\nin A. silvaticus, parts of it often found in young plants on the margin\r\nof the cap, forming a ring on the stem which soon almost disappears.\r\nSpores small, 4-5×2-3µ.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the cap, the rounding of the gills both in front and\r\nbehind, also the tendency to turn white paper blue or bluish when the\r\nflesh of the cap comes in contact with it, will assist in determining\r\nthis species.\r\n\r\nIt is found in grassy places in open woods, especially in the vicinity\r\nof pine trees, October and November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Agaricus placomyces.

This is one of our prettiest plants.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is broadly ovate, rather thin, at first convex, but when it\r\nis fully expanded it is quite flat, whitish, brown in the center, as\r\nwill be seen in Figure 256, but it is covered with a persistent brown\r\nscale.\r\n\r\nThe gills are white at first, then pink, turning blackish brown, quite\r\ncrowded.\r\n\r\nThe stem is rather long, and slender, cylindrical stuffed, somewhat\r\nbulbous at the base, commonly whitish but at times bears yellow stains\r\ntoward the base, tapering toward the cap. The veil is quite interesting.\r\nIt is broad and double, loosely joined together by threads, the lower or\r\nouter veil breaking first into regular radiating portions. The spores\r\nare elliptical, 5-6.5µ long. The caps are two to four inches broad and\r\nthe stem is three to five inches long.\r\n\r\nThey are found in lawns or in thin woods. They are much more abundant in\r\nhemlock woods though they are frequently found in mixed woods in which\r\nthere are hemlock trees. The behavior of the veil is very similar to A.\r\narvensis and A. silvicola and indeed this plant seems to be very\r\nclosely related to these species. It is found from July to September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Agaricus cretaceus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE CHALK AGARIC.

Flesh white\r\nand unchangeable.\r\n\r\nThe gills are at first white or whitish, then pink, finally\r\nblackish-brown.\r\n\r\nThe stem is rather long, often somewhat thickened or bulbous at the\r\nbase, at first stuffed, then hollow, white, the ring is scaly on the\r\nunder side, mycelium whitish, forming slender branching root-like\r\nstrings. The spores are elliptical. _Peck_, 48th Rep. N. Y. State Bot.\r\n\r\nThe reddish-brown color is due to the coating of fibrils that covers the\r\ncap. In the center it does not separate into scales, hence it is\r\nsmoother and more distinctly reddish-brown than the rest. Its veil\r\nresembles that of the A. placomyces, but instead of the lower surface\r\nbreaking into radial portions it breaks into small floccose flakes or\r\nscales.\r\n\r\nThis species is found about greenhouses, and is frequently found in\r\nlarge clusters.\r\n\r\nDr. McIlvaine says: \"This species is now cultivated and has manifest\r\nadvantages over the market species--it is easier to cultivate, very\r\nproductive, produces in less time after planting the spawn, is free from\r\nattacks of insects, carries better and keeps longer.\"\r\n\r\nMushroom beds in cellars are becoming quite popular and many are having\r\nvery good results.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Agaricus halophilus.

Natural size.]\r\n\r\nHalophilus is from two Greek words meaning sea and loving, or fond of.\r\n\r\nThis is a large fleshy plant and does not readily decay. At first it is\r\nquite round, then becomes broadly convex. All specimens that I have\r\nexamined were covered with adpressed scales of a reddish-brown color,\r\nbecoming grayish-brown when old. The flesh is white, becoming pink or\r\nreddish when cut. The margin has a peculiar angular turn, often\r\nretaining portions of the rather fragile veil.\r\n\r\nThe taste is pleasant, and the odor is distinctly that of the seashore.\r\n\r\nThe gills are quite narrow, as will be seen in Figure 258, much crowded,\r\nfree, pinkish at first, becoming purplish-brown as the plant matures.\r\nThe edge of the gills is whitish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, stout, solid, firm, equal, or occasionally slightly\r\nbulbous. The ring is rather delicate and in older specimens it is\r\nfrequently wanting. The spores are broadly elliptical and\r\npurplish-brown, 7-8×5-6µ.\r\n\r\nThe specimens in figure 258 were sent to me from Boston, Mass., by\r\nMrs. Blackford, and on opening the box the odor of the seashore was\r\nplainly noticed. The flesh when cut quickly turned to a pinkish or\r\nreddish hue and the water in which the plants were prepared for cooking\r\nwas changed to a faintly pink tinge. These plants were sent me the first\r\nof June, but the stems were free from worms and were as easily cooked as\r\nthe caps. I regard it as one of the very best mushrooms for table use,\r\nwhile also easy to distinguish.\r\n\r\nIt seems to delight in sandy soil near salt water. This was formerly\r\ncalled Agaricus maritimus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pilosace. Fr._\r\n\r\nPilosace is from two Greek words, _pilos_, felt; _sakos_, garment.\r\n\r\nHymenophore is distinct from the stem. Gills are free, and at first\r\nremote, from the stem. The general and partial veil are both absent,\r\nhence it is without ring or volva. This genus seems to have the habit of\r\nAgaricus but no ring.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Pilosace eximia. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 259.--Pilosace eximia.]\r\n\r\nEximia means choice, distinguished.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, thin, convex or broadly campanulate, at length\r\nexpanded and subumbonate, smooth, dark sooty-brown.\r\n\r\nThe gills are close, broad, ventricose, rounded behind, free, dull-red,\r\nor brownish-pink, then brown.\r\n\r\nThe stem is slender, hollow, a little thicker at the base, dull-red. The\r\nspores are elliptical, .004 inch long.\r\n\r\nThese plants are small and quite rare, yet I have found the plants in\r\nHaynes' Hollow on three different occasions. Dr. Peck writes that it is\r\na very rare plant. It grows on old stumps and decayed logs. The plants\r\nin figure [259?] were found in Haynes' Hollow and photographed by Dr.\r\nKellerman.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stropharia. Fr._\r\n\r\nStropharia is from the Greek, strophos, a sword belt. The spores are\r\nbright purple-brown, brown or slate color. The flesh of the stem and the\r\npileus is continuous. The veil, when ruptured, forms a ring on the stem.\r\nThe gills are rounded and are not free.\r\n\r\nThe genus can be distinguished from all the genera of the purple-spored\r\nplants except the Agarics by the presence of a ring and by the united\r\nflesh of the stem and the cap and by the attachment of the gills. They\r\ngrow on the ground or are elliptical.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stropharia semiglobata. Batsch._\r\n\r\nTHE SEMIGLOBOSE STROPHARIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G.

Similar\r\ncells on edge of gills, but somewhat smaller and more regular.\r\n\r\nStem even at the base, tapering to a short root, transversely floccose,\r\nscaly both above and below the ring. The ring membranaceous, not\r\nprominent but still evident, about 2 cm. from the apex. _Atkinson._\r\n\r\nThe specimens in Figure 261 are very old plants. While the plant was in\r\nseason I did not photograph it, but when Prof. Atkinson named it I\r\nhastened to find some good specimens but only two had survived\r\nsufficiently to photograph. They were found October 15, 1906, on Mr.\r\nMiller's farm in Poke Hollow near Chillicothe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stropharia stercoraria. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE DUNG STROPHARIA.

The pileus is slightly fleshy at the\r\ncenter but thin at the margin; hemispherical, then expanded, even,\r\nsmooth, discoid, slightly striate on the margin.\r\n\r\nThe gills are firmly attached to the stem, slightly crowded, broad,\r\nwhite, umber, then olive-black.\r\n\r\nThe stem is three inches or more long, stuffed with a fibrous pith,\r\nequal, ring close to cap, flocculose below the ring, viscid when moist,\r\nyellowish.\r\n\r\nThis species is distinguished from the S. semiglobata by the distinct\r\npithy substance with which the stem is stuffed, also by the fact that\r\nthe cap is never fully expanded. It is found on dung and manure piles,\r\nin richly manured fields, and sometimes in woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stropharia æruginosa. Curt._\r\n\r\nTHE GREEN STROPHARIA.\r\n\r\nÆruginosa is from ærugo, verdigris. The pileus is fleshy, plano-convex,\r\nsubumbonate, clothed with a green evanescent slime, becoming paler as\r\nthe slime disappears.\r\n\r\nThe gills are firmly attached to the stem, soft, brown, tinged with\r\npurple, slightly ventricose, not crowded.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow, equal, fibrillose or squamose below the ring, tinged\r\nwith blue.\r\n\r\nThis species is quite variable in form and color. The most typical forms\r\nare found in the fall, in very wet weather and in shady woods. This is\r\none of the species from which the ban has not been removed but its\r\nappearance will lead no one to care to cultivate its acquaintance\r\nfurther than name it. It is claimed by most writers that it is\r\npoisonous. Found in meadows and woods, from July to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hypholoma. Fr._\r\n\r\nHypholoma is from two Greek words, meaning a web and a fringe, referring\r\nto the web-like veil which frequently adheres to the margin of the cap,\r\nnot forming a ring on the stem and not always apparent on old specimens.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, margin at first incurved. The gills are attached\r\nto the stem, sometimes notched at the stem. The stem is fleshy, similar\r\nin substance to the cap.\r\n\r\nThey grow mostly in thick clusters on wood either above or under the\r\nground. The spores are brown-purple, almost black.\r\n\r\nThis genus differs from the genus Agaricus from the fact that its gills\r\nare attached to the stem and its stem is destitute of a ring.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hypholoma incertum.

Prof. Peck, who named this species, was uncertain\r\nwhether it was not a form of H. candolleanum, to which it seemed to be\r\nvery closely related; but as the gills of that plant are at first\r\nviolaceous and of this one white at first, he concluded to risk the\r\nuncertainty on a new species.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is thin, ovate, broadly spreading, fragile, whitish, margin\r\noften wavy and often adorned with fragments of the woolly white veil,\r\nopaque when dry, transparent when moist.\r\n\r\nThe gills are thin, narrow, close, fastened to the stem at their inner\r\nextremity, white at first, then purplish-brown, edges often uneven.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal, straight, hollow, white, slender, at least one to\r\nthree inches long. The spores are purplish-brown and elliptical. It is\r\nfound in lawns, gardens, pastures, and thin woods. It is small but grows\r\nin such profusion that one can obtain quantities of it. The caps are\r\nvery tender and delicious. It appears as early as May.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hypholoma appendiculatum. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE APPENDICULATE HYPHOLOMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nAppendiculatum, a small appendage. This is so called from the fragments\r\nof the veil adhering to the margin of the cap.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is thin, ovate, expanded, watery, when dry, covered with dry\r\natoms; margin thin and often split, with a white veil; the color when\r\nmoist dark-brown, when dry nearly white, often with floccose scales on\r\nthe cap.\r\n\r\nThe gills are firmly attached to the stem, crowded, white, then\r\nrosy-brown, and at length dingy-brown.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow, smooth, equal, white, fibrous, mealy at the apex.\r\nThe veil is very delicate and only seen in quite young plants.\r\n\r\nThe plant grows in the spring and the summer and is found on stumps and\r\nsometimes on lawns. It is a favorite mushroom with those who know it.\r\nThe plant can be dried for winter use and retains its flavor to a\r\nremarkable degree.\r\n\r\nHypholoma candolleanum, Fr., resembles the H. appendiculatum in many\r\nfeatures, but the gills are violaceous, becoming cinnamon-brown and in\r\nold plants nearly free from the stem. It has more substance. The caps,\r\nhowever, are very tender and delicious. Found in clusters.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hypholoma lachrymabundum. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE WEEPING HYPHOLOMA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 263.--Hypholoma lachrymabundum. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 264.--Hypholoma lachrymabundum.]\r\n\r\nLachrymabundum--full of tears. This plant is so called because in the\r\nmorning or in damp weather the edge of the gills retain very minute\r\ndrops of water. The plant in Figure 263 was photographed in the\r\nafternoon yet there can be seen a number of these minute drops.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, campanulate, then convex, sometimes broadly\r\numbonate, spotted with hairy scales; flesh white.\r\n\r\nThe gills are closely attached to the stem, notched, crowded, somewhat\r\nventricose, unequal, whitish, then brown-purple, distilling minute drops\r\nof dew in wet weather or in the morning.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow, somewhat thickened at the base, quite scaly with\r\nfibrils, often becoming brownish-red, two to three inches long. The\r\nspores are brownish-purple.\r\n\r\nI have never found the plant elsewhere than on the Chillicothe high\r\nschool lawn, and then not in sufficient numbers to test its edible\r\nqualities. When I do, I shall try it cautiously, but with full faith\r\nthat I shall be permitted to try others. Found on the ground and on\r\ndecayed wood. It often grows in clusters. September to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hypholoma sublateritium. Schaeff._\r\n\r\nTHE BRICK-RED HYPHOLOMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 265.--Hypholoma sublateritium. Natural size.]\r\n\r\n_Sublateritium is from sub, under, and later, a brick._ The pileus is\r\nbrick-red, with pale yellowish border; the surface is covered with fine\r\nsilky fibres; fleshy, moist, and firm; the cap is from two to four\r\ninches broad; remnants of the veil are often seen on the margin; flesh\r\ncreamy, firm, and bitter.\r\n\r\nThe gills are creamy when young, olive when old; attached to the stem at\r\ninner extremity, rather narrow, crowded, and unequal.\r\n\r\nThe stem is creamy when young, lower part slightly tinged with red,\r\nhollow or stuffed, having silky fibres on the surface, two to four\r\ninches long, often incurved because of position. The spores are\r\nsooty-brown and elliptical.\r\n\r\nIt grows in large clusters around old stumps. It is especially plentiful\r\nabout Chillicothe. It is not equal to many others of the Hypholomas as\r\nan esculent. Sometimes it is bitter even after it is cooked. Captain\r\nMcIlvaine gives a plausible reason when he says it may be due to the\r\npassage of larvæ through the flesh of the plant. It is found from\r\nSeptember to early winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hypholoma perplexum. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE PERPLEXING HYPHOLOMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 266.--Hypholoma perplexum. One-half natural size.\r\nCaps brown, with a pale yellow margin.]\r\n\r\nPerplexum means perplexing; so called because it is quite difficult to\r\ndistinguish it from H. sublateritium, also from H. fascicularis. From\r\nthe latter it may be known by its redder cap, its whitish flesh,\r\npurple-brown tint of the mature gills and mild flavor. Its smaller size,\r\nthe greenish and purplish tint of the gills, and the slender hollow stem\r\nwill aid in distinguishing it from H. perplexum.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is complex, fleshy, expanded, smooth, sometimes broadly and\r\nslightly umbonate, brown with a pale-yellow margin, disk sometimes\r\nreddish.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rounded, notched, easily separating from the stem,\r\npale-yellow, greenish ash-color, finally purplish-brown, thin, quite\r\nclose.\r\n\r\nThe stem is nearly equal, firm, hollow, slightly fibrillose, yellowish\r\nor whitish above and reddish-brown below. The spores are elliptical and\r\npurplish brown.\r\n\r\nThis plant is very abundant in Ohio. It grows about old stumps, but a\r\nfavorite habitat seems to be upon old sawdust piles. I have found it\r\nafter we have had considerable freezing weather. The plants in the\r\nfigure were frozen when I found them, the 27th of November. Dr.\r\nMcIlvaine says in his book, \"If the collector gets puzzled, as he will,\r\nover one or all of these species, because no description fits, he can\r\nwhet his patience and his appetite by calling it H. perplexum and\r\ngraciously eating it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Psilocybe. Pers._\r\n\r\n_Psilocybe is from two Greek words, naked and head._ The spores are\r\npurple-brown or slate color. The pileus is smooth, at first incurved,\r\nbrownish or purple. The stem is cartilaginous, ringless, tough, hollow,\r\nor stuffed, often rooting. Generally growing on the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Psilocybe foenisecii. Pers._\r\n\r\nTHE BROWN PSILOCYBE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 267.--Psilocybe foenisecii. One-half natural size.]\r\n\r\nFoenisecii means mown hay.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is somewhat fleshy, smoky-brown or brownish, convex,\r\ncampanulate at first, then expanded; obtuse, dry, smooth.\r\n\r\nThe gills are firmly attached to the stem, ventricose, not crowded,\r\nbrownish-umber.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow, straight, even, smooth, not rooting, white, covered\r\nwith dust, then brownish.\r\n\r\nQuite common in grassy lawns and fields after summer rains. I have never\r\neaten it, but I have no doubt of its esculent qualities.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Psilocybe spadicea. Schaeff._\r\n\r\nTHE BAY PSILOCYBE. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nSpadicea means bay or date-brown.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, convex-plane, obtuse, even, moist, hygrophanous,\r\nbright bay-brown, paler when dry.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rounded behind, attached to stem, easily separating from\r\nit, narrow, dry, crowded, white, then rosy-brown or flesh-color.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow, tough, pallid, equal, smooth, one to two inches\r\nlong. They grow in dense clusters where old stumps have been or where\r\nwood has decayed. The caps are small but very good. They are found from\r\nSeptember to frost or freezing weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Psilocybe ammophila. Mont._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 268.--Psilocybe ammophila. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize, showing the sand on the base.]\r\n\r\nAmmophila is from two Greek words; ammos, sand, and philos, loving; so\r\ncalled because the plants seem to delight to grow in sandy soil.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is small, convex, expanded, umbilicate, at first\r\nhemispherical, rather fleshy, yellow, tinged with red, fibrillose.\r\n\r\nThe gills are smoky in color, with a decurrent tooth, powdered with the\r\nblackish spores.\r\n\r\nThe stem is soft, rather short, hollow, lower half clavate and sunk into\r\nthe sand, striate. The spores are 12×8.\r\n\r\nThey are found in August and September. They delight in sandy soil, as\r\nthe specific name indicates. The plants in the photograph were found\r\nnear Columbus and photographed by Dr. Kellerman. It is quite common in\r\nsandy soil. I do not think it is edible. I should advise great caution\r\nin its use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK-SPORED AGARICS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe genera belonging to this series have black spores. There is an\r\nentire absence of purple or brown shades. The genus Gomphidius, placed\r\nin this series for other reasons, has dingy-olivaceous spores.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coprinus. Pers._\r\n\r\nCoprinus is from a Greek word meaning dung. This genus can be readily\r\nrecognized from the black spores and from the deliquescence of the gills\r\nand cap into an inky substance. Many of the species grow in dung, as the\r\nname implies, or on recently manured ground. Some grow in flat rich\r\nground, or where there has been a fill, or on dumping grounds; some grow\r\non wood and around old stumps.\r\n\r\nThe pileus separates easily from the stem. The gills are membranaceous,\r\nclosely pressed together. The spores, with few exceptions, are black.\r\nMost of the species are edible, but many are of such small size that\r\nthey are easily overlooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coprinus comatus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE SHAGGY MANE COPRINUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by Prof Shaftner._\r\n\r\nFigure 269.--Coprinus comatus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 270.--Coprinus comatus. One-half natural size.]\r\n\r\nComatus is from coma, having long hair, shaggy. It is so called from a\r\nfancied resemblance to a wig on a barber's block. A description is\r\nhardly necessary with a photograph before us. They always remind us of a\r\ncongregation of goose eggs standing on end. This plant cannot be\r\nconfounded with any other, and the finder is the happy possessor of a\r\nrich, savory morsel that cannot be duplicated in any market.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, moist, at first egg-shaped, cylindrical, becoming\r\nbell-shaped, seldom expanded, splitting at the margin along the line of\r\nthe gills, adorned with scattered yellowish scales, tinged with\r\npurplish-black, yet sometimes entirely white; surface shaggy.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free, crowded, equal, creamy white, becoming pink, brown,\r\nthen black, and dripping an inky fluid.\r\n\r\nThe stem is three to eight inches long, hollow, smooth, or slightly\r\nfibrillose, tapering upward, creamy-white, brittle, easily separating\r\nfrom the cap, slightly bulbous at the base. The ring is rarely adherent\r\nor movable in young plants, later lying on the ground at the base of the\r\nstem or disappearing altogether. The spores are black and elliptical,\r\nand are shed in liquid drops.\r\n\r\nFound in damp rich ground, gardens, rich lawns, barnyards, and dumping\r\ngrounds. They often grow in large clusters. They are found everywhere in\r\ngreat abundance, from May till late frost. A weak stomach can digest any\r\nof the Coprini when almost any other food will give it trouble. I am\r\nalways pleased to give a dish of any Coprini to an invalid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coprinus atramentarius. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE INKY COPRINUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 271.--Coprinus atramentarius. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nAtramentarius means black ink. The pileus is at first egg-shaped, gray\r\nor grayish-brown, smooth, except that there is a slight scaly\r\nappearance; often covered with a marked bloom, margin ribbed, often\r\nnotched, soft, tender, becoming expanded, when it melts away in inky\r\nfluid.\r\n\r\nThe gills are broad, close, ventricose, creamy-white in young specimens,\r\nbecoming pinkish-gray, then black, moist, melting away in inky drops.\r\n\r\nThe stem is slender, two to four inches in length, hollow, smooth,\r\ntapering upward, easily separating from the cap, with slight vestige of\r\na collar near the base when young but soon disappearing. The spores\r\nare elliptical, 12×6µ., and black, falling away in drops.\r\n\r\nI have found it abundantly all over the state, from May till late frost.\r\nIn Figure 271 the one in the center will show the spot-like scales; on\r\nthe others the bloom referred to is quite apparent; the section to the\r\nright shows the broad, ventricose gills--cream-white though slightly\r\ntinged with pink--also the shape of the stem. The plant at the extreme\r\nright has expanded and begun to deliquesce. C. atramentarius is very\r\nabundant, growing in rich soil, lawns, filled places, and gardens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XXXVIII. Figure 272.--Coprinus atramentarius.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coprinus micaceus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE GLISTENING COPRINUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 273.--Coprinus micaceus. Two-thirds natural size.]\r\n\r\nMicaceus is from _micare_, to glisten, and refers to the small scales on\r\nthe pileus which resemble mica scales. The pileus is tawny-yellow, tan\r\nor light buff, ovate, bell-shaped; having striations radiating from near\r\nthe center of the disk to the margin; glistening mica-like scales\r\ncovering undisturbed young specimens; the margin somewhat revolute or\r\nwavy.\r\n\r\nThe gills are crowded, rather narrow, whitish, then tinged with pinkish\r\nor purplish-brown then black.\r\n\r\nThe stem is slender, fragile, hollow, silky, even, whitish, often\r\ntwisted, one to three inches long. The spores are blackish, sometimes\r\nbrown, elliptical, 10×5µ.\r\n\r\nThe Glistening Coprinus is a small but common and beautiful species. One\r\ncannot fail to recognize a Coprinus from a photograph. It is somewhat\r\nbell-shaped and marked with impressed lines or striations from the\r\nmargin to or beyond the center of the disk and sprinkled with fugacious\r\nmicaceous granules all of which show in Figure 273. For eating, this is\r\nwithout doubt the best mushroom that grows. The specimens in Figure 273\r\ngrew around an old peach stump in Dr. Miesse's yard, in Chillicothe. You\r\nwill find them around any stump, especially just before a rain. If you\r\nsecure a good supply and wish to keep them, partially cook them and warm\r\nthem for use.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coprinus ebulbosus. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 274.--Coprinus ebulbosus. One-half natural size.]\r\n\r\n_Ebulbosus_, without being bulbous. This seems to be the difference\r\nbetween the American and the European plants, the latter being bulbous.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is membranaceous, at first ovate, bell-shaped, striate,\r\nvariegated with broad white scales, or white patches; one to two inches\r\nbroad.\r\n\r\nThe gills are free, broad, ventricose, grayish-black, soon deliquescing.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow, equal, fragile, smooth, four to five inches long.\r\n\r\nUsually found where old stumps have been cut off under the ground,\r\nleaving the roots in the ground. It is very abundant. The collector will\r\nhave no trouble to recognize it from Figure 274. They are found from\r\nJune to October. Edible, but not as good as C. atramentarius.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coprinus ephemerus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE EPHEMERAL COPRINUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nEphemerus, lasting for a day. This plant lasts only for a short time. It\r\ncomes up in the early morning or at night and as soon as the sun's rays\r\ntouch it it deliquesces into an inky fluid.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is membranaceous, very thin, oval, slightly covered with\r\nbran-like scales, disk elevated, even.\r\n\r\nGills are adnexed, distant, whitish, brown, then black. The stem is\r\nslender, equal, pellucid, smooth, from one to two inches high.\r\n\r\nWhen this plant is fully developed it is quite a beautiful specimen,\r\nstriated from margin to center. Found on dung and dung heaps and in well\r\nmanured grass plots from May to October. It must be cooked at once. Its\r\nchief value is its excellent mushroom flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coprinus ovatus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE OVATE COPRINUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n_Ovatus is from ovum_, an egg. It is so called from the shape of the\r\npileus, which is somewhat membranaceous, ovate, then expanded, striate;\r\nat first woven into densely imbricated, thick, concentric scales; is\r\nbulbous, rooting, flocculose, hollow above, the ring deciduous; gills\r\nfree, remote, slightly ventricose, for sometime white, then\r\number-blackish.\r\n\r\nThis plant is much smaller and less striking than the C. comatus, yet\r\nits edible qualities are the same. I have eaten it and found it\r\ndelicious. It is found in about the same locality in which you would\r\nexpect to find the C. comatus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Coprinus fimetarius. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE SHAGGY DUNG COPRINUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate XXXIX. Figure 275.--Coprinus fimetarius.]\r\n\r\n_Fimetarius is from fimetum, a dunghill._ The pileus is somewhat\r\nmembranaceous, clavate, then conical, at length torn and revolute; at\r\nfirst rough with floccose scales, then naked; longitudinally cracked and\r\nfurrowed, even at the apex. The stem is inclined to be scaly, thickened\r\nat the base, solid. The gills are free, reaching the stem, at first\r\nventricose, then linear, brownish-black. _Fries._\r\n\r\nThis is quite a variable plant. There are a number of varieties classed\r\nunder this species. It is said to be of excellent flavor. I have never\r\neaten it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Panæolus. Fr._\r\n\r\nPanæolus is from two Greek words, all; variegated. This genus is so\r\ncalled from the mottled appearance of the gills. The pileus is somewhat\r\nfleshy, margin even, but never striate. The margin always extends beyond\r\nthe gills and the gills are not uniform in color. The mottled appearance\r\nof the gills is due to the falling of the black spores. The gills do not\r\ndeliquesce.\r\n\r\nThe stem is smooth, sometimes scaly, at times quite long, hollow. The\r\nveil, when present, is interwoven.\r\n\r\nThis plant is found on rich lawns recently manured, but principally on\r\ndung.\r\n\r\nThere are only two edible species, P. retirugis and P. solidipes. The\r\nother species would not be likely to attract the attention of the\r\nordinary collector.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Panæolus retirugis. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE RIBBED PANAEOLUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate XL. Figure 276.--Panaeolus retirugis. Natural size, showing\r\nportions of the veil on the margin.]\r\n\r\nRetirugis is from rete, a net; ruga, a wrinkle. The pileus is about one\r\ninch in diameter, inclined to be globose, then hemispherical, slightly\r\numbonate, center darker, with united raised ribs, sometimes sprinkled\r\nwith opaque atoms; veil torn, appendiculate.\r\n\r\nThe gills are fixed, ascending, broad in middle; and in the expanded\r\nforms the gills are separated more and more from the stem and finally\r\nappear more or less triangular; cinereous-black, frequently somewhat\r\nclouded.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal, covered with a frost-like bloom, cylindrical,\r\nsometimes tortuous, cartilaginous, becoming hollow, pinkish-purple,\r\nalways darker below and paler above, bulbous.\r\n\r\nThe veil in young and unexpanded plants is quite strong and prominent;\r\nas the stem elongates it loosens from the stem, and as the cap expands\r\nit breaks into segments, frequently hanging to the margin of the cap.\r\nBy close observation one will sometimes detect a black band on the stem,\r\ncaused by the falling of the black spores, when the plant is damp,\r\nbefore the pileus has separated from the stem. The spores are black and\r\nelliptical.\r\n\r\nI have found it a number of times on the Chillicothe high school lawn,\r\nespecially after it was fertilized in the winter. It is found mostly on\r\ndung from June to October. I do not recommend it as a delicacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Panæolus epimyces. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 277.--Panæolus epimyces. Note black spores in\r\ncentral foreground. Note also huge masses of abortive stuff upon which\r\nit grows.]\r\n\r\nEpimyces is from _epi_, upon; _myces_, a mushroom; so called because it\r\nis parasitic on fungi. There are a number of species of mushrooms whose\r\nhabitat is on other mushrooms or fungus growths; such as Collybia\r\ncirrhata, C. racemosa, C. tuberosa, Volvaria loveiana and the species of\r\nNyctalis.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, at first subglobose, then convex, white, silky,\r\nfibrillose, flesh white or whitish, soft.\r\n\r\nThe gills are rather broad, somewhat close, rounded behind, adnexed,\r\ndingy-white, becoming brown or blackish, with a white edge.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, stout, tapering upwards, strongly striate and\r\nminutely mealy or pruinose; solid in the young plant, hollow in the\r\nmature, but with the cavity small; hairy, or substrigose at the base.\r\nThe spores elliptical and black, .0003 to .00035 of an inch long, .0002\r\nto .00025 broad. _Peck._\r\n\r\nThe plants are small, about two thirds to an inch broad and from an inch\r\nto an inch and a half high. It is referred to this genus because of its\r\nblack spores. It has other characteristics which would seem to place it\r\nbetter among Hypholomas. It is not common. Found in October and\r\nNovember. The specimens in Figure 277 were found in Michigan and\r\nphotographed by Dr. Fisher.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Panæolus campanulatus. Linn._\r\n\r\nBELL-SHAPED PANAEOLUS.\r\n\r\nCampanulatus is from _campanula_, a little bell.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is an inch to an inch and a quarter broad, oval or\r\nbell-shaped, sometimes slightly umbonate, smooth, somewhat shining,\r\ngrayish-brown, sometimes becoming reddish-tinted, the margin often\r\nfringed with fragments of the veil.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attached, not broad, ascending, variegated with gray and\r\nblack.\r\n\r\nThe stem is three to five inches long, hollow, slender, firm, straight,\r\noften covered with frost-like bloom and often striate at the top, the\r\nveil remaining only a short time. The spores are subellipsoid, 8-9×6µ.\r\n\r\nThe gills do not deliquesce. It is widely distributed and is found in\r\nalmost any horse pasture.\r\n\r\nCaptain McIlvaine says in his book that he has eaten it in small\r\nquantities, because larger could not be obtained, and with no other than\r\npleasant effect. I have found it about Chillicothe quite frequently but\r\nhave never eaten it. It is found from June to August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Panæolus fimicolus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE DUNG PANAEOLUS.\r\n\r\nFimicolus is from fimus, dung; colo, to inhabit. The pileus somewhat\r\nfleshy, convex-bell-shaped, obtuse, smooth, opaque; marked near the\r\nmargin with a narrow brown zone; the stem is fragile, elongated, equal,\r\npallid, covered with frost-like bloom above; the gills are firmly\r\nattached to the stem, broad, variegated with gray and brown. _Fries._\r\n\r\nThe plant is very small and unimportant. It is found on dung, as its\r\nname indicates, from June to September. The caps appear lighter in color\r\nwhen dry than when wet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Panæolus solidipes. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE SOLID FOOT PANAEOLUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate XLI. Figure 278.--Panaeolus solidipes.]\r\n\r\nSolidipes is from solidus, solid; pes, foot; and is so called because\r\nthe stem of the plant is solid. The pileus is two to three inches\r\nacross; firm; at first hemispherical, then subcampanulate or convex;\r\nsmooth; white; the cuticle at length breaking up into dingy-yellowish,\r\nrather large, angular scales. The gills are broad, slightly attached,\r\nwhitish, becoming black. The stem is five to eight inches long and two\r\nto four lines thick, firm, smooth, white, solid, slightly striate at the\r\ntop. The spores are very black with a bluish tint. _Peck._ 23d Rep. N.\r\nY. State Bot.\r\n\r\nThis is a large and beautiful plant and easily distinguished because of\r\nits solid stem, growing on dung. Sometimes minute drops of moisture will\r\nbe seen on the upper part of the stem. The plant is said to be one of\r\nthe best of mushrooms to eat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Panæolus papilionaceus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE BUTTERFLY PANAEOLUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 279.--Panæolus papilionaceus. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nPapilionaceus is from _papilio_, a butterfly.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is about an inch broad, somewhat fleshy, at first\r\nhemispherical, sometimes subumbonate, the cuticle breaking up into\r\nscales when dry, as will be seen in the photograph, pale-gray with a\r\ntinge of reddish-yellow especially on the disk, sometimes smooth.\r\n\r\nThe gills are broadly attached to the stem, quite wide, at length plane,\r\nblackish or with varying tints of black.\r\n\r\nThe stem is three to four inches long, slender, firm, equal, hollow,\r\npowdered above, whitish, sometimes tinged with red or yellow, slightly\r\nstriate at the top, as will be seen in the photograph with a glass,\r\ngenerally stained with the spores.\r\n\r\nThe specimens in Figure 279 were found in a garden that had been\r\nstrongly manured. It is usually found on dung and on grassy lawns during\r\nMay and June. Captain McIlvaine in his book speaks of this mushroom\r\nproducing hilarity or a mild form of intoxication. I should advise\r\nagainst its use.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anellaria. Karst._\r\n\r\nAnellaria is from _anellus_, a little ring. This genus is so called\r\nbecause of the presence of a ring on the stem.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is somewhat fleshy, smooth, and even. The gills are adnexed,\r\ndark slate-colored, variegated with black spores. The stem is central,\r\nsmooth, firm, shining, ring persistent or forming a zone around the\r\nstem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Anellaria separata. Karst._\r\n\r\nSeparata means separate or distinct.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is somewhat fleshy, bell-shaped, obtuse, even, viscid, at\r\nfirst ochraceous, then dingy-white, shining, smooth, wrinkled when old.\r\n\r\nThe gills are firmly attached to the stem, broad, ventricose, thin,\r\ncrowded, clouded, cinereous, margin nearly white, slightly deliquescent.\r\n\r\nThe stem is long, straight, shining, white, thickened downward, ring\r\ndistant, top somewhat striate, bulbous at the base. The spores are\r\nbroadly elliptic-fusiform, black, opaque, 10×7µ.\r\n\r\nIt is found on dung from May to October. It is not poisonous.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bolbitius. Fr._\r\n\r\nBolbitius is from a Greek word meaning cow-dung, referring to its place\r\nof growth.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is membranaceous, yellow, becoming moist; gills moist but not\r\ndeliquescing, finally losing their color and becoming powdery; stem\r\nhollow and confluent with the hymenophore. As the generic name implies\r\nthe plant usually grows on dung, but sometimes it is found growing on\r\nleaves and where the ground had been manured the year before. The spores\r\nare of a rusty-red color.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bolbitius fragilis. (L.) Fr._\r\n\r\nFragilis means fragile.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is membranaceous, yellow, then whitish, viscid, margin\r\nstriate, disk somewhat umbonate.\r\n\r\nThe gills are attenuated, adnexed, nearly free, ventricose, yellowish,\r\nthen pale cinnamon.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three inches long, naked, smooth, yellow. The spores\r\nare rust-colored, 7×3.5, Massee. 14-15×8-9µ. Saccardo.\r\n\r\nThis species is much more delicate and fragile than B. Boltoni. I find\r\nit often in dairy pastures. It is well flavored and cooks readily. Found\r\nfrom June to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bolbitius Boltoni. Fr._\r\n\r\nBOLTON'S BOLBITIUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is somewhat fleshy, viscid, at first smooth, then the margin\r\nsulcate, disk darker and slightly depressed.\r\n\r\nThe gills are nearly adnate, yellowish, then livid-brown.\r\n\r\nThe stem is attenuated, yellowish, ring fugacious. This is rather common\r\nin dairy pastures and is found from May to September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Psathyrella. Fr._\r\n\r\nPsathyrella is from a Greek word meaning fragile. The members of this\r\ngenus are mebranaceous, striated, margin straight, at first pressed to\r\nthe stem, not extending beyond the gills. Gills adnate or free,\r\nsooty-black, not variegated. The stem is confluent with, but different\r\nin character from, the spore-bearing surface. Veil inconspicuous and\r\ngenerally absent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Psathyrella disseminata. Pers._\r\n\r\nTHE CLUSTERED PSATHYRELLA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 280.--Psathyrella disseminata. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nDisseminata is from _dissemino_, to scatter. Pileus is about a half inch\r\nacross, membranaceous, ovate, bell-shaped, at first scurvy, then naked;\r\ncoarsely striated, margin entire; yellowish then gray. Gills adnate,\r\nnarrow, whitish, then gray, finally blackish. Stem one to one and a half\r\ninches long, rather curved, mealy then smooth, fragile, hollow.\r\n_Massee._\r\n\r\nThis is a very small plant, growing on grassy lawns, and very common on\r\nold trunks, and about decaying stumps.\r\n\r\nA cluster about two yards square shows itself at intervals all summer on\r\nthe Chillicothe High School lawn. The grass shows itself to be greener\r\nand thriftier there on account of fertilization by the mushroom. The\r\nentire plant is very fragile and soon melts away. I have eaten the caps\r\nraw many times and they have a rich flavor. They are found from May till\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Psathyrella hirta. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 281.--Psathyrella hirta.]\r\n\r\nHirta means hairy, rough or shaggy.\r\n\r\nPileus thin, hemispherical or convex, adorned when young with erect or\r\nspreading tufts of white, easily determined and quickly evanescent\r\nhairs; hygrophanous, brown or reddish-brown and slightly striatulate\r\nwhen moist, pale grayish-brown or dingy-whitish when dry, flesh\r\nsubconcolorous; lamellæ broad, moderately close, adnate and often\r\nfurnished with a decurrent tooth, at first pallid, becoming\r\nblackish-brown or black; stem flexuose, squamose, hollow, shining,\r\nwhite; spores elliptical, black, .0005 to .00055 inch long, .00025 to\r\n.0003 broad.\r\n\r\nSubcæspitose; pileus 4 to 6 lines broad; stem 1 to 2 inches long to\r\n1 1-5 lines thick. The specimens in Figure 281 were found in the\r\ngreenhouse at the State University. When quite young tufts of white hair\r\nwere very conspicuous. They are scarcely observed in mature specimens.\r\nThe plants were photographed by Dr. Kellerman.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gomphidius. Fr._\r\n\r\nGomphidius is from a Greek word meaning a wooden bolt or peg.\r\n\r\nThe hymenophore is decurrent on the stem. The gills are decurrent,\r\ndistant, soft, somewhat mucilaginous; edge acute, pruinate with the\r\nblackish fusiform spores; veil viscoso-floccose, forming an imperfect\r\nring around the stem.\r\n\r\nA small, but distinct, genus, with great difference among species;\r\nintermediate by its habits between Cortinarius and Hygrophorus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gomphidius viscidus. Fr._\r\n\r\nVISCID GOMPHIDIUS.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to three inches broad, viscid, convex, then depressed\r\nround the disk, obtusely umbonate, margin acute, reddish-brown to\r\nyellowish-brown in the center, the margin liver-color, flesh\r\nyellowish-brown.\r\n\r\nThe gills are decurrent, distant, somewhat branched, firm, elastic,\r\nrather thick, purple-brown with an olive tinge.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three inches high, subequal or slightly ventricose;\r\npale yellowish-brown, fibrillose, firm, solid, slimy from the remains of\r\nthe veil, which form an obsolete filamentose ring.\r\n\r\nThe spores are elongato-fusiform, 18-20×6µ.\r\n\r\nIts favorite habitat is under pine and fir trees. Its taste is sweet and\r\nit has the mushroom smell. It is edible, but not first-class.\r\n\r\nFound in September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nPOLYPORACEAE. TUBE-BEARING FUNGI.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this family the cap has no gills on the upper surface, but, instead,\r\nthere are small tubes or pores. This class of plants may be naturally\r\ndivided into two groups: The perishable fungi with the pores easily\r\nseparating from the cap and from each other, which may be called\r\nBoletaceæ; and the leathery, corky, and woody fungi, with pores\r\npermanently united to the cap and with each other, making the family\r\nPolyporaceæ.\r\n\r\nIn each group the spores are borne on the lining of the pore. A spore\r\nprint may be made in the same manner as from mushrooms having gills. The\r\ncolor of the spores does not enter into the classification as in the\r\ncase of the Agaricini.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive characteristics of these genera may be stated as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Pores compacted together and forming a continuous stratum            1\r\n  Pores each a distinct tube, standing closely side by side    Fistulina\r\n  1. Stem central, and stratum of spores easily separable\r\n      from the cap                                               Boletus\r\n  1. Stratum of tubes not separating easily, cap covered\r\n      with coarse scales                                   Strobilomyces\r\n     Stratum of tubes separating, but not easily; tubes\r\n      arranged in distinct, radiating lines. In Boletinus\r\n      porosus the tubes do not separate from the cap           Boletinus\r\n     Stratum of pores not separable from cap; plant soft when\r\n      young, but becoming hard, corky, stipitate, shelving     Polyporus\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus. Dill._\r\n\r\n_Boletus, a clod_. There are very many species under this genus and the\r\nbeginner will experience much trouble in separating the species with any\r\ndegree of assurance. The Boletus is distinguished from the other\r\npore-bearing fungi by the fact that the stratum of tubes is easily\r\nseparable from the cap. In the Polyporus the stratum of tubes cannot be\r\nseparated.\r\n\r\nNearly all Boleti are terrestrial and have central stems. They grow in\r\nwarm and rainy weather. Many are very large and ponderous; fleshy and\r\nputrescent, decaying soon after maturity. It is important to note\r\nwhether the flesh changes color when bruised and whether the taste is\r\npleasant or otherwise. When I first began to study the Boleti there were\r\nbut few species that were thought to be edible, but the ban has been\r\nremoved from very many, even from the most wicked, Boletus Satanus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus scaber. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE ROUGH-STEMMED BOLETUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 282.--Boletus scaber. Two-thirds natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe pileus is from two to five inches in diameter, rounded convex,\r\nsmooth, viscid when moist, minutely woolly, velvety or scaly, color from\r\nnearly white to almost black, the flesh white.\r\n\r\nThe tubes are free from the stem, white, long, mouths minute and round.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, tapering slightly upward, long, dingy-white;\r\nroughened with blackish-brown or reddish dots or scales, this being the\r\nmost pronounced characteristic by which to distinguish the species;\r\nthree to five inches long. The spores are oblong fusiform and brown.\r\n\r\nProf. Peck has described a number of varieties under this species, most\r\nof which depend on the color of the cap. All are edible and good.\r\n\r\nThis is a common plant, usually found in woods and shady waste places,\r\nfrom June to October. Photographed by Prof. H. C. Beardslee.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus granulatus. L._\r\n\r\nTHE GRANULATED BOLETUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 283.--Boletus granulatus. One-half natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to three inches broad, hemispherical, then convex; at\r\nfirst covered with a brownish gluten, then turning yellowish; flesh\r\nthick, yellowish, does not turn blue; margin involute at first.\r\n\r\nThe tubes are adnate; at first white, then light yellow; the margin\r\ndistilling a pale watery fluid which when dry gives the granulated\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, one to two inches high, thick, solid, pale yellow\r\nabove, white below, granulated. The spores are spindle-shaped,\r\nrusty-yellow.\r\n\r\nThis plant grows abundantly in pine regions, but I have found it where\r\nonly a part of the trees were pine. The brownish gluten, always constant\r\non the pileus, and the gummy juice drying upon the stem, like granules\r\nof sugar, will be strong features by which to identify the species.\r\n\r\nThey are found from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus bicolor. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE TWO-COLORED BOLETUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is convex, smooth or merely downy, dark red, fading when old,\r\noften marked with yellow; flesh yellow, slowly changing to blue when\r\nbruised.\r\n\r\nThe tubes are bright yellow, attached to the stem, the color changing to\r\nblue when bruised.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, red, generally red at the top, one to three inches\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nThe spores are pale, rusty-brown color.\r\n\r\nFound in woods and open places, from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus subtomentosus. L._\r\n\r\nTHE YELLOW-CRACKED BOLETUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 284.--Boletus subtomentosus. One-half natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nSubtomentosus, slightly downy. The pileus is from three to six inches\r\nbroad, convex, plane; yellowish-brown, olive or subdued tan color;\r\ncuticle soft and dry, with a fine pubescence; the cracks in the surface\r\nbecome yellow. The flesh is creamy white in mature specimens, changing\r\nto blue, and at length leaden, on being bruised.\r\n\r\nThe tube surface is yellow or yellowish green, becoming bluish when\r\nbruised; opening of tubes large and angular.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stout, yellowish, minutely roughened with scurvy dots or\r\nfaintly striped with brown. The spores are a rusty-brown.\r\n\r\nThe cracks in the cap become yellow, on which account this species is\r\ncalled the Yellow-cracked Boletus. The taste of the flesh is sweet and\r\nagreeable. Palmer compares it with the taste of a walnut. The plant\r\nshould not be feared because the flesh turns blue when bruised. I first\r\nfound this species in Whinnery's woods, Salem, Ohio. The specimens in\r\nFigure 284 grew near Chillicothe and was photographed by Dr. Kellerman.\r\nJuly to August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus chrysenteron. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE RED-CRACKED BOLETUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 285.--Boletus chrysenteron. One-half natural size.\r\nCaps yellowish to red. Flesh yellow.]\r\n\r\nChrysenteron means gold or golden within. The pileus is two to four\r\ninches broad, convex, becoming more flattened, soft to the touch,\r\nvarying from light to yellowish-brown or bright brick-red, more or less\r\nfissured with red cracks; the flesh yellow, changing to blue when\r\nbruised or cut, red immediately beneath the cuticle.\r\n\r\nThe tube surface is olive-yellow, becoming bluish when bruised,\r\ntube-openings rather large, angled and unequal in size.\r\n\r\nThe stem is generally stout, straight, yellowish, and more or less\r\nstreaked or spotted with the color of the cap. The spores are light\r\nbrown and spindle-shaped. This species will be easily distinguished from\r\nB. subtomentosus because of its bright color and the cracks in the cap\r\nturning red, whence the name of the \"Red-cracked Boletus.\"\r\n\r\nThe cap of this species strongly resembles Boletus alveolatus, but the\r\nlatter has rose-colored spores and a red pore surface, while the former\r\nhas light brown spores and an olive-yellow pore surface. Tolerton's and\r\nBower's woods, Salem, Ohio, July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus edulis. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE EDIBLE BOLETUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XLII. Figure 286.--Boletus edulis.\r\n\r\nPileus light brown, tubes yellowish or greenish-yellow. Stem bulbous and\r\nfaintly reticulate. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nThis is quite a large and handsome plant and one rather easily\r\nrecognized. The firm caps of the young plant and the white tubes with\r\ntheir very indistinct mouths, and the mature plants with the tubes\r\nchanging to a greenish yellow with their mouths quite distinct, are\r\nenough to identify the plant at once.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is convex or nearly plane; variable in color, light brown to\r\ndark brownish-red, surface smooth but dull, cap from three to eight\r\ninches broad. The flesh is white or yellowish, not changing color on\r\nbeing bruised or broken.\r\n\r\nThe tube-surface is whitish in very young plants, at length becoming\r\nyellow and yellowish-green. Pore openings angled. The tubes depressed\r\naround the stem, which is stout, bulbous, often disproportionately\r\nelongated; pale-brown; straight or flexuous, generally with a fine\r\nraised net-work of pink lines near junction of cap, sometimes extending\r\nto the base. The taste is agreeable and nutty, especially when young.\r\nWoods and open places. July and August. Common about Salem and\r\nChillicothe, Ohio.\r\n\r\nIt is one of our best mushrooms. Captain McIlvaine says: \"Carefully\r\nsliced, dried, and kept where safe from mold, it may be prepared for the\r\ntable at any season.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus speciosus. Frost._\r\n\r\nTHE HANDSOME BOLETUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 287.--Boletus speciosus. Natural size. Cap red or\r\ndeep scarlet. Tubes bright lemon-yellow.]\r\n\r\nSpeciosus means handsome.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is three to six inches broad, at first very thick,\r\nsubglobose, compact, then softer, convex, glabrous or nearly so, red or\r\ndeep scarlet. The flesh is pale yellow or bright lemon-yellow, changing\r\nto blue where wounded.\r\n\r\nThe tubes are adnate, small, subrotund, plane, or slightly depressed\r\naround the stem; bright lemon-yellow, becoming dingy-yellow with age,\r\nchanging to blue where bruised.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to four inches long, stout, subequal or bulbous,\r\nreticulated, bright lemon-yellow without and within, sometimes reddish\r\nat the base. The spores are oblong-fusiform, pale, ochraceous-brown,\r\n10-12.5×4-5µ.\r\n\r\nThe young specimen can be recognized by the whole plant's being of a\r\nvivid lemon-yellow except the surface of the cap. The plant quickly\r\nturns to green, then blue, wherever touched. It has a wide distribution\r\nin the Eastern and Middle states. The plant in Figure 287 was found in\r\nHaynes' Hollow by Dr. Chas. Miesse and photographed by Dr. Kellerman.\r\n\r\nAs an edible it is among the best. Found from August to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus cyanescens. Bull._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 288.--Boletus cyanescens.]\r\n\r\nCyanescens is from _cyaneus_, deep blue, so called the moment you touch\r\nit, it turns a deep blue.\r\n\r\nPileus is two to four inches across, convex, then expanded, sometimes\r\nnearly plane, frequently wavy, covered with an appressed tomentum;\r\nopaque, pale-buff, grayish-yellow, or yellowish, flesh thick, white,\r\nquickly changing to a beautiful azure-blue where cut or wounded.\r\n\r\nThe tubes are quite free, openings small, white, then pale-yellow,\r\nround, changing color the same as the flesh.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three inches long, ventricose, hoary with fine hair,\r\nstuffed at first, then becoming hollow, colored like the pileus.\r\n\r\nThe spores are subelliptical, 10-12.5×6-7.5µ.\r\n\r\nThe specimens in Figure 288 were found on rather steep wooded hillsides,\r\nSugar Grove, Ohio. They were all solitary. I have found a few specimens\r\nabout Chillicothe. They are widely distributed in the Eastern states.\r\n\r\nCaptain McIlvaine says in his book the caps make an excellent dish\r\ncooked in any way. I have never tried them. Found on hilly ground in\r\nAugust and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus indecisus. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE UNDECIDED BOLETUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 289.--Boletus indecisus. One-half natural size.]\r\n\r\nIndecisus means undecided; so called because it favors very closely\r\nBoletus felleus. There is a difference in the style of the two plants by\r\nwhich, after continued tasting, the student can readily separate them.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is three to four inches broad, dry, slightly downy, convex,\r\nochraceous-brown, plane, often irregular on the margin, sometimes wavy,\r\nflesh white, and unchangeable, taste mild or sweet.\r\n\r\nThe tube surface is nearly plane and firmly set against the stem,\r\ngrayish, becoming tinged with flesh color in age, changing to a brown\r\nwhen bruised; the mouths small and nearly round. The stem is covered\r\nwith a fine mealy substance, straight or flexuous, sometimes reticulated\r\nabove. The spores are oblong, brownish flesh color, 12.5-15×4µ.\r\n\r\nThe B. indecisus can be readily told from B. felleus by its sweet taste\r\nand brownish spores. It is my favorite of all the Boleti, indeed I think\r\nit equals the best of mushrooms. Its favorite habitat is under beech\r\ntrees in the open. It is widely distributed from Massachusetts to the\r\nwest. Found in July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus edulis. Bull.--Var. clavipes. Pk._\r\n\r\nCLUB-FOOTED BOLETUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 290.--Boletus edulis, var. clavipes. Two-thirds\r\nnatural size. Note confluent caps on right.]\r\n\r\nClavipes means club-footed. Pileus fleshy, convex, glabrous, grayish-red\r\nor chestnut-color. Flesh white, unchangeable. The tubes at first concave\r\nor nearly plane, white and stuffed, then convex, slightly depressed\r\naround the stem, ochraceous-yellow. Stem mostly obclavate, inversely\r\nclub-shaped, and reticulate to the base. The spores oblong-fusiform,\r\n12-15×4-5µ. _Peck._ 51st Rep.\r\n\r\nThe club-footed Boletus is very closely related to B. edulis. It\r\ndiffers, perhaps, in a more uniform color of the cap, and in having\r\ntubes less depressed around the stem, and less tinted with green when\r\nmature. The stem is more club-shaped and more completely reticulated.\r\n\r\nThe pileus in the young plant is much more highly colored and fades out\r\nin age, but the margin does not become paler than the disk as is often\r\nthe case with B. edulis. The specimens in Figure 290 were found in\r\nMichigan and photographed by Dr. Fischer. They are quite as good as B.\r\nedulis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus Sullivantii. B. & M._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 291.--Boletus sullivantii.]\r\n\r\nSullivantii is named in honor of Professor Sullivant, an early Ohio\r\nbotanist.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is three to four inches broad, hemispherical at first,\r\nglabrous, reddish-tawny or brown, brownish when dry, cracked in squares.\r\n\r\nThe tubes are free, convex, medium size, angular, longer toward the\r\nmargin, their mouths reddish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, violaceous at the thickened base, red-reticulated at\r\nthe apex, expanded into the pileus.\r\n\r\nThe spores are pallid to ochraceous, oblong-fusiform, 10-20µ long.\r\n_Peck's_ Boleti in U. S.\r\n\r\nThis species is very close to Boletus scaber and Boletus edulis. It\r\ndiffers from B. scaber in its reticulated stem and from B. edulis in its\r\nlarger tubes. The specimens in Figure 291 were found by Hambleton Young\r\nnear Columbus, and were photographed by Dr. Kellerman.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus parvus. Pk._\r\n\r\nParvus means small; so named from the smallness of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one to two inches broad, convex, becoming plane, often\r\nslightly umbonate, subtomentose, reddish. Flesh yellowish-white, slowly\r\nchanging to pinkish when bruised.\r\n\r\nThe tubes are nearly plane, adnate, their mouths rather large, angular,\r\nat first bright-red, becoming reddish-brown.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal or slightly thickened below, red, from one to two\r\ninches long. The spores are oblong, 12.5×4µ.\r\n\r\nThey are found in thin woods, July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus eximius. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE SELECT BOLETUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 292.--Boletus eximius. Two-thirds natural size.]\r\n\r\nEximius means select.\r\n\r\nThe pileus at first is very compact, nearly round, somewhat covered with\r\na mealy substance, purplish-brown, or chocolate color, sometimes with a\r\nfaint tinge of lilac, becoming convex, soft, smoky red, or\r\npale-chestnut, flesh grayish or reddish-white.\r\n\r\nThe tube surface is at first concave or nearly plane, stuffed, colored\r\nnearly like the pileus, becoming paler with age and depressed around the\r\nstem, the mouths minute, round.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stout, generally short, equal or tapering upward, abruptly\r\nnarrowed at the base, minutely branny, colored like or a little paler\r\nthan the cap, purplish-gray within.\r\n\r\nThe spores are subferruginous, 12.5-15×5-6µ. This plant is found in\r\nopen woods where there are beech trees. I found it frequently on\r\nCemetery Hill, Chillicothe. It is widely distributed, being found from\r\nthe east to the west. July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus pallidus. Frost._\r\n\r\nTHE PALLID BOLETUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nPallidus, pale. The pileus is convex, becoming plane or centrally\r\ndepressed, soft, smooth, pallid or brownish-white, sometimes tinged with\r\nred. Flesh is white. Tubes plane or slightly depressed around the stem,\r\nnearly adnate, very pale or whitish-yellow, becoming darker with age,\r\nchanging to blue where wounded, the mouths small. The stem is equal or\r\nslightly thickened toward the base, rather long, smooth, often flexuous;\r\nwhitish, sometimes streaked with brown, often tinged with red within.\r\nSpores pale ochraceous-brown. Pileus two to four inches broad. Stem\r\nthree to five inches long. _Peck_, Boleti of the U. S.\r\n\r\nThis species is very good, tender, and appetizing. I found it quite\r\nabundant in the woods of Gallia County and near Chillicothe, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus alveolatus. B. and C._\r\n\r\nTHE ALVEOLATE BOLETUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 293.--Boletus alveolatus.]\r\n\r\nAlveolatus is from _alveolus_, a small hollow, referring to the pitted\r\nform of the pore-surface, which is one of the characters of this\r\nspecies. The pileus is convex, smooth, polished, usually rich crimson or\r\nmaroon, sometimes varied with paler yellowish tints; substance solid,\r\nchanging to blue on being fractured or bruised, three to six inches\r\nbroad.\r\n\r\nThe tube-surface reaches the stem proper, undulate with uneven hollows,\r\nmaroon, the tubes in section being yellow beyond their dark red mouths.\r\n\r\nThe stem is usually quite long, covered with depressions or pitted\r\ndentations, with intermediate coarse net-work of raised ridges, red and\r\nyellow. The spores are yellowish-brown. I found this species in the\r\nwoods near Gallipolis, Ohio, also near Salem, Ohio. The bright color of\r\nits cap will command the attention of any one passing near it. It has\r\nbeen branded as a reprobate, but Captain McIlvaine gives it a good\r\nreputation. Found in the woods, especially along streams, August and\r\nSeptember. Photographed by Prof. H. C. Beardslee.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus felleus. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE BITTER BOLETUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by Prof. Atkinson._\r\n\r\nFigure 294.--Boletus felleus. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nFelleus is from _fel_, gall, bitter. The pileus is convex, nearly plane,\r\nat first rather firm in substance, then becoming soft and cushion-like,\r\nsmooth, without polish, varying in color from pale ochre to yellowish or\r\nreddish-brown or chestnut, flesh white, changing to flesh-color when\r\nbruised, taste exceedingly bitter, cap three to eight inches in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nThe tube-surface is white at first, becoming dull pinkish with age or\r\nupon being cut or broken; rounded upward as it reaches the stem,\r\nattached to the stem, mouths angular.\r\n\r\nThe stem is variable, tapering upward, rather stout, quite as smooth as\r\nthe cap and a shade paler in color, toward the apex covered with a\r\nnet-work which extends to the base, often bulbous.\r\n\r\nThe flesh is not poisonous but intensely bitter. No amount of cooking\r\nwill destroy its bitterness. I gave it a thorough trial, but it was as\r\nbitter after cooking as before. It is a common Boletus about Salem,\r\nOhio. I have seen plants there eight to ten inches in diameter and very\r\nheavy. They grow in woods and wood margins, usually about decaying\r\nstumps and logs, sometimes in the open fields. July to September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus versipellis. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE ORANGE-CAP BOLETUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 295.--Boletus versipellis. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nVersipellis is from _verto_, to change, and _pellis_, a skin. The pileus\r\nis two to six inches in diameter, convex, orange-red, dry, minutely\r\nwoolly or downy, then scaly or smooth, margin containing fragments of\r\nthe veil, flesh white or grayish.\r\n\r\nThe tube-surface is grayish-white, tubes long, free, mouths minute and\r\ngray.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal or tapering upward; solid, white with scaly wrinkles;\r\nthree to five inches long; and is frequently covered with small reddish\r\nor blackish dots or scales. The spores are oblong spindle-shaped.\r\n\r\nThis plant can be easily distinguished by the remnant of the veil which\r\nadheres to the margin of the cap and is of the same color. It is\r\nfrequently turned under the margin adhering to the tubes. It is a large\r\nand imposing plant found in sandy soil and especially among the pines. I\r\nfound it in J. Thwing Brooke's woods, Salem, Ohio. August to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus gracilis. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE SLENDER-STEMMED BOLETUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 296.--Boletus gracilis. Two-thirds natural size.]\r\n\r\nGracilis means slender, referring to the stem.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one to two inches broad, convex, smooth or minutely\r\ntomentose, the epidermis frequently cracked as in the illustration;\r\nochraceous-brown, tawny, or reddish brown; flesh white.\r\n\r\nThe tube surface is convex to plane, depressed around the stem, nearly\r\nfree, whitish, becoming flesh-colored.\r\n\r\nThe stem is long and slender, equal or slightly tapering upward, usually\r\ncurved; pruinose or mealy. The spores are subferruginous, .0005 to .0007\r\ninch long, .0002 to .00025 inch broad.\r\n\r\nThis is quite a pretty plant, but at first sight it will not be taken\r\nfor a Boletus. They are not plentiful in our woods. I find them only\r\noccasionally and then sparsely. They are found in July and August, the\r\nmonths for the Boleti. They grow in leaf mold in mixed woods, especially\r\namong beech timber.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus striæpes. Secr._\r\n\r\nStriæpes means striate stem.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is convex or plane, soft, silky, olivaceous, the cuticle\r\nrust-color within, flesh white, yellow next the tubes, sparingly\r\nchanging to blue.\r\n\r\nThe tubes are adnate, greenish, their mouths minute, angular, yellow.\r\n\r\nThe stem is firm, curved, marked with brownish-black striations, yellow,\r\nand brownish-rufescent at the base.\r\n\r\nThe spores are 10-13×4µ. _Peck_, Boleti of the U. S.\r\n\r\nI found some beautiful specimens in a mixed woods on the Edinger\r\nhillside, near Chillicothe. I located them here, but observing that this\r\nspecies was not common I sent some to Prof. Atkinson, who placed them\r\nunder this species. August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus radicans. Pers._\r\n\r\nThe pileus is convex, dry, subtomentose, olivaceous-cinereus, becoming\r\npale-yellowish, the margin thin, involute. Flesh pale-yellow, taste\r\nbitterish.\r\n\r\nThe tubes are adnate, their mouths large, unequal; lemon-yellow.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three inches long, even, tapering downward and\r\nradiating, flocculose with a reddish bloom, pale-yellow, becoming naked\r\nand dark with a touch.\r\n\r\nThe spores are fusiform, olive, 10-12.5×5µ. _Peck_, Boleti of the U. S.\r\n\r\nI found these specimens in the same locality with the B. striæpes.\r\n\r\nThe olivaceous cap with its peculiar involute margin and its radiating\r\nstem will greatly assist in its determination. August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus subluteus. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE YELLOW BOLETUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 297.--Boletus subluteus. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nSubluteus is from _sub_, under, nearly; _luteus_, yellow.\r\n\r\nPileus is two to three inches broad, convex, becoming plane, quite\r\nviscid when moist, dull yellowish to reddish brown, frequently more or\r\nless streaked. The flesh is whitish or dull yellow.\r\n\r\nThe tube surface is plane or convex, the tubes set squarely against the\r\nstem, being small, nearly round, yellowish or ochraceous, becoming\r\ndarker in age.\r\n\r\nThe stem is rather long, nearly equal, about the color of the cap,\r\ndotted both above the ring and below it; the ring is membranaceous,\r\nquite variable and persistent, usually collapsing as a narrow ring on\r\nthe stem. The spores are ochraceous-brown, oblong or elliptical,\r\n8-10×4-5.\r\n\r\nProf. Atkinson has made a careful study of both the American and the\r\nEuropean plants called in this country B. luteus and B. subluteus, and\r\nhas come to the conclusion that they should all be called B. luteus. In\r\ndistinguishing the two we usually say those having much gluten and\r\ndotted above the ring are B. luteus, and those dotted both above and\r\nbelow the ring are B. subluteus. The specimens in Figure 297 were\r\ncollected at the State Farm at Lancaster, Ohio, and photographed by Dr.\r\nKellerman. They are found in July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus parasiticus. Bull._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 298.--Boletus parasiticus.]\r\n\r\nParasiticus means a parasite; so called because it grows on a\r\nScleroderma. It is a small plant and quite rare.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one to two inches broad, convex, or nearly plane, dry,\r\nsilky, becoming glabrous, soon tessellately cracked, grayish or dingy\r\nyellow. Tubes decurrent, medium size, golden yellow.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal, rigid, incurved, yellow within and without. The\r\nspores are oblong-fusiform, pale-brown, 12.5-15×4µ. _Peck._\r\n\r\nThe tubes are rather large and unequal, and inclined to run down upon\r\nthe stem.\r\n\r\nThis plant was found near Boston, Mass., by Mrs. E. B. Blackford and\r\nphotographed by Dr. Kellerman. Captain McIlvaine says it is edible but\r\nnot of good flavor. It is found in July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus separans. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE SEPARATING BOLETUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 299.--Boletus separans. One-half natural size.]\r\n\r\nSeparans, separating, alluding to the tubes sometimes separating from\r\nthe stem by the expansion of the pileus.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is convex, thick, smooth, subshining, often pitted or\r\ncorrugated; brownish-red or dull-lilac, sometimes fading to yellowish on\r\nthe margin; flesh white and unchangeable.\r\n\r\nTubes at first are nearly plane, adnate, white and stuffed, then convex,\r\ndepressed around the stem, ochraceous-yellow or brownish-yellow and\r\nsometimes separating from the stem by the expansion of the pileus.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal or slightly tapering upward; reticulated, either\r\nwholly or in upper part only; colored like the pileus or a little\r\npaler, sometimes slightly furfuraceous. Spores subfusiform,\r\nbrownish-ochraceous. _Peck_, Boleti of U. S.\r\n\r\nThe specimens in Figure 299 were found at Londonderry, about fifteen\r\nmiles east of Chillicothe, in a grassy woods near a stream. The taste is\r\nagreeable when raw and quite good when cooked. This might appropriately\r\nhave been called the lilac Boletus, for that shade of color is usually\r\npresent in it, somewhere. August to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus auripes. Pk._\r\n\r\nYELLOW-STEMMED BOLETUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 300.--Boletus auripes. One-half natural size. Caps\r\nyellowish-brown. Tube surface and stem yellow.]\r\n\r\nAuripes is from _aureus_, yellow or golden; _pes_, foot; so called from\r\nits yellow stem.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is three to four inches broad, convex, nearly smooth,\r\nyellowish-brown, the flesh often cracking in areas in old plants; flesh\r\nyellow at first, fading to a lighter color, in age.\r\n\r\nThe tubes are nearly plane, their mouths small, nearly round, at first\r\nstuffed, yellow.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to four inches long, nearly equal, often reticulated,\r\nsolid, a bright yellow on the surface and a light yellow within. The\r\nspores are ochraceous-brown, tinged with green, 12×5µ.\r\n\r\nThe whole plant, except the upper surface of the cap, is a golden\r\nyellow, and even the surface of the cap is more or less yellow. It\r\nfavors one form of the B. edulis. It is sometimes found in mixed woods,\r\nespecially if there are mountain laurels in the woods (_Kalmia\r\nlatifolia_). It is found in July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus retipes. B. and C._\r\n\r\nTHE BEAUTIFUL-STEMMED BOLETUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 301.--Boletus retipes. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nRetipes is from _rete_, a net; _pes_, a foot; so called from the\r\ndelicate net-work seen on the stem.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is convex, dry, powdered with yellow, sometimes rivulose or\r\ncracked in areas. The tubes are adnate, yellow.\r\n\r\nThe stem is subequal, cespitose, reticulate to the base, pulverulent\r\nbelow. The spores are greenish-ochraceous, 12-15×4-5µ. _Peck_, Boleti.\r\n\r\nB. retipes is very close to B. ornatipes, but its manner of growth, its\r\npulverulent cap, and its greenish-ochraceous spores will at once\r\ndistinguish it. I have found them on Ralston's Run, a number from the\r\nsame mycelial cluster, as in Figure 301. The caps only are good. The\r\nspecimens in the figure were found near Ashville, N. C., and\r\nphotographed by Prof. H. C. Beardslee.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus griseus. Frost._\r\n\r\nTHE GRAY BOLETUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 302.--Boletus griseus. Two-thirds natural size.]\r\n\r\nGriseus means gray. The pileus is broadly convex, firm, dry, almost\r\nsmooth, gray or grayish black. The flesh is whitish or gray.\r\n\r\nThe tubes are attached to the stem and slightly depressed around the\r\nstem, nearly plane, their mouths being small, nearly round, white or\r\nwhitish.\r\n\r\nThe stem is slightly unequal, tapering downward, distinctly reticulated,\r\nwhitish or yellowish, sometimes reddish toward the base. The spores are\r\nochraceous-brown, 10-14×4-5µ. _Peck._\r\n\r\nThis plant, with us, grows singly and it is infrequently found. I have\r\nfound it always in beech woods along Ralston's Run. It is found in\r\nAugust and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus nigrellus. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE BLACKISH BOLETUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 303.--Boletus nigrellus. Two-thirds natural size.]\r\n\r\nNigrellus is a diminutive of _niger_, black. The entire plant is\r\nblackish except the pore surface.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is three to six inches broad, rather broadly convex or nearly\r\nplane, dry, blackish. The flesh is soft and unchangeable.\r\n\r\nThe tube-surface is rather plane, adhering to the stem, sometimes\r\nslightly depressed around the stem, the mouths being small, nearly\r\nround; whitish, becoming flesh-colored, changing to black or brown when\r\nwounded.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal, short, even, black or blackish. The spores are dull\r\nflesh-color, 10-12×5-6µ.\r\n\r\nWhen I first found this specimen I was inclined to call it B. alboater,\r\nbut its flesh-colored tubes served to distinguish it. I found the\r\nspecimens in Figure 303 on Edinger's Hill, near Chillicothe. The taste\r\nis mild and fairly good. August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus Americanus. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 304.--Boletus Americanus. One-half natural size.]\r\n\r\nThis species will attract the attention of the collector because of its\r\nvery viscid cap. I found the specimens in Figure 304 growing on Cemetery\r\nHill, near Chillicothe, in company with Lactarius deliciosus. They were\r\ngrowing near and under pine trees, both in dense groups and separately.\r\nThe caps were very viscid, yellow with a slight tinge of red. The stem\r\nis covered with numerous reddish-brown dots.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one to three inches broad, thin; at first rather globose,\r\nconvex, then expanded, sometimes broadly umbonate; very viscid when\r\nmoist, especially on the margin; yellow or becoming dingy or streaked\r\nwith red in age.\r\n\r\nThe tube-surface is nearly plane and the tubes join squarely against the\r\nstem; quite large, angular, pale yellow, becoming a dull ochraceous.\r\n\r\nThe stem is slender, equal or tapering upward, firm, with no trace of a\r\nring; yellow, often brownish toward the base, covered with numerous\r\nbrown or reddish-brown quite persistent granular dots; yellow within.\r\nThe spores are oblong, ochraceous-ferruginous, 9-11×4-5µ.\r\n\r\nThe veil is only observed in the very young specimens. Only caps are\r\ngood to eat. The specimens were photographed for me by Dr. Kellerman.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus Morgani. Pk._\r\n\r\nMORGAN'S BOLETUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 305.--Boletus Morgani. One-half natural size.]\r\n\r\nMorgani is named in honor of Prof. Morgan.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one and a half to two inches broad, convex, soft,\r\nglabrous, viscid; red, yellow, or red fading to yellow on the margin;\r\nflesh white, tinged with red and yellow, unchangeable.\r\n\r\nThe tube-surface convex, depressed around the stem, tubes rather long\r\nand large, bright yellow, becoming greenish-yellow.\r\n\r\nThe stem is elongated, tapering upward, pitted with long and narrow\r\ndepressions, yellow, red in the depressions, colored within like the\r\nflesh of the pileus. The spores are olive-brown, 18-22µ, about half as\r\nbroad. _Peck._\r\n\r\nThis plant is found in company with B. Russelli, which it resembles very\r\nclosely. Its smooth, viscid cap and white flesh will distinguish it. Its\r\nstem is much more rough in wet weather than in dry. The peculiar color\r\nof the stem will help to identify the species. I found it frequently on\r\nRalston's Run, near Chillicothe. It is found in many of the states of\r\nthe Union. July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus Russelli. Frost._\r\n\r\nRUSSELL'S BOLETUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 306.--Boletus Russelli. One-half natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe cap is thick, hemispherical or convex, dry, covered with downy\r\nscales or bundles of red hairs, yellowish beneath the tomentum, often\r\ncracked in areas. The flesh is yellow and unchangeable.\r\n\r\nThe tubes are subadnate, often depressed around the stem, rather large,\r\ndingy-yellow, or yellowish-green.\r\n\r\nThe stem is very long, equal or tapering upward, roughened by the\r\nlacerated margins of the reticular depressions, red or brownish red. The\r\nspores are olive-brown, 18-22×8-10µ.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one and a half to four inches broad, the stem is three to\r\nseven inches long, and three to six lines thick. This is distinguished\r\nfrom the other species by the dry squamulose pileus and the color of the\r\nstem. The latter is sometimes curved at the base. _Peck._\r\n\r\nI have found this species frequently in the woods and open places about\r\nChillicothe. It is one of the easiest of the Boleti to determine. The\r\nplants here have a bright brownish-red pileus, with a shade lighter\r\ncolor on the stem; the latter quite rough and tapering toward the cap.\r\nThey are usually solitary. The plants in Figure 306 were collected in\r\nMichigan and photographed by Dr. Fischer.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus vermiculosus. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 307.--Boletus vermiculosus. One-half natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nVermiculosus means full of small worms. The pileus is broadly convex,\r\nthick, firm, dry; smooth, or very minutely tomentose; brown,\r\nyellowish-brown or grayish-brown, sometimes tinged with red. The flesh\r\nis white or whitish, quickly changing to blue where wounded. The tubes\r\nare plane or slightly convex, nearly free, yellow; their mouths small,\r\nround, brownish-orange, becoming darker or blackish with age, changing\r\npromptly to blue where wounded.\r\n\r\nThe stem is nearly equal, firm, even, paler than the pileus. The spores\r\nare ochraceous-brown, 10-12×4-5µ. _Peck._\r\n\r\nThe plant represented in Figure 307 grew under the beech trees on\r\nCemetery Hill. I found it frequently in the woods, from July to\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus Frostii. Russell._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 308.--Boletus Frostii. Caps blood-red and shining.\r\nNatural size.]\r\n\r\nFrostii is named in honor of Mr. Frost, a noted mycologist.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is three to four inches broad; convex, polished, shining,\r\nblood-red; the margin is thin, the flesh scarcely changing to blue.\r\n\r\nThe tubes are nearly free, greenish-yellow, becoming yellowish-brown\r\nwith age, their mouths blood-red or cinnabar-red.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to four inches long, three to six lines thick, equal or\r\ntapering upward, distinctly reticulated, firm, blood-red. The spores are\r\n12.5-15×5µ. _Peck_, Boleti of U. S.\r\n\r\nThis is a beautiful plant. It is not plentiful, yet it is found\r\nfrequently on some of our hillsides. The plants in Figure 308 were found\r\nin Hayne's Hollow near Chillicothe, and photographed by Dr. Kellerman.\r\nThe plant is found in New England and through the Middle West. I have\r\nhad beautiful plants sent me from Vermont. It is not edible, so far as I\r\nknow. Found in August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus luridus. Schaeff._\r\n\r\nTHE LURID BOLETUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 309.--Boletus luridus. One-half natural size.]\r\n\r\nLuridus means pale-yellow, sallow. The pileus is convex, tomentose,\r\nbrown-olivaceous, then somewhat viscous, sooty. The flesh is yellow,\r\nchanging to blue when wounded. Tubes free, yellow, becoming greenish,\r\ntheir mouths round, vermilion, becoming orange. The stem is stout,\r\nvermilion, somewhat orange at the top, reticulate or punctuate. The\r\nspores are greenish-gray, 15×9µ.\r\n\r\nThe lurid Boletus, though pleasant to the taste, is reputed very\r\npoisonous. Boletus rubeolarius, Pers., having a short, bulbous, scarcely\r\nreticulated stem, is regarded as a variety of this species. The\r\nred-stemmed Boletus, B. erythropus, Pers., is also indicated by Fries as\r\na variety of luridus. It will be seen on the right in Figure 309. It is\r\nsmaller than B. luridus, has a brown or reddish-brown pileus and a\r\nslender cylindrical stem, not reticulated but dotted with squamules.\r\n_Peck_, Boleti of the U. S. The plant is quite abundant in our woods.\r\nFound in July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus castaneus. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE CHESTNUT BOLETUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 310.--Boletus castaneus. One-half natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 311.--Boletus castaneus.]\r\n\r\nCastaneus, pertaining to a chestnut. The pileus is dry, convex, then\r\nexpanded, minutely velvety; cinnamon or reddish-brown, from one to three\r\ninches in diameter; the flesh white, not changing when bruised, cap\r\nfrequently turned upward.\r\n\r\nThe tube-surface is white, becoming yellow, tubes small and short, free\r\nfrom the stem.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal or tapering upward, colored and clothed like the cap,\r\nshort and not always straight; when young it is spongy in the center but\r\nbecomes hollow with age. The spores are pale-yellow, oval or broadly\r\nelliptical, which is a feature to distinguish the species.\r\n\r\nI found a number of specimens in James Dunlap's woods, near Chillicothe,\r\nOhio. A great majority seemed to be attacked by the parasitic fungi,\r\nSepedonium chrysospermum.\r\n\r\nThe caps are very fine eating. Care should be taken to use only young\r\nspecimens. Found in open woods from June to September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletus satanus. Lenz._\r\n\r\nSATANIC BOLETUS.\r\n\r\nPileus convex, smooth, somewhat gluey, brownish-yellow or whitish; flesh\r\nwhitish, becoming reddish or violaceous where wounded. Tubes free,\r\nyellow, their mouths bright red, becoming orange-colored with age. The\r\nstem thick, ovate-ventricose, marked above with red reticulations.\r\n_Peck_, Boleti of U. S.\r\n\r\nHamilton Gibson and Captain McIlvaine seem to give his Satanic majesty a\r\ngood reputation, but I would say \"Be cautious.\" His looks always\r\ndeterred me. Found in woods from June to September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Strobilomyces. Berk._\r\n\r\nStrobilomyces is from two Greek words meaning a pine-cone and a fungus.\r\nThe hymenophore is even, tubes not easily separable from it, large and\r\nequal. It is of a brownish-gray color, its shaggy surface more or less\r\nstudded with deep-brown or black woolly points, each at the center of a\r\nscale-like segment. The tubes beneath are covered at first with a veil\r\nwhich breaks and is often found on the rim of the cap. It is a plant\r\nthat will quickly attract attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Strobilomyces strobilaceus. Berk._\r\n\r\nTHE CONE-LIKE BOLETUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 312.--Strobilomyces strobilaceus. Two-thirds\r\nnatural size.]\r\n\r\nStrobilaceus, cone-like. This is especially emphasized from the fact\r\nthat both the genus and the species are named from the fancied\r\nresemblance of the cap to a pine cone. It is ever readily recognized\r\nbecause of this character of the cap.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is convex, rough with dark umber scales drawn into regular\r\ncone-like points tipped with dark-brown; margin veiled, flesh\r\ngrayish-white, turning red when bruised, and finally black.\r\n\r\nPore-surface grayish-white in young specimens, and usually covered with\r\nthe veil; tubes attached to the stem, angular, turning red when bruised.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal or tapering upward, furrowed at the top, covered with\r\na woolly down. Spores dark-brown, 12-13×9µ. Found at Londonderry.\r\nCommon in woods. August to September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletinus. Kalchb._\r\n\r\nBoletinus is a diminutive of Boletus.\r\n\r\nHymenium composed of broad radiating lamellæ, connected by very numerous\r\nand narrow anastomosing branches or partitions, forming large angular\r\npores. Tubes somewhat tenacious, not easily separable from the\r\nhymenophore and from each other, adnate or subdecurrent, yellowish.\r\n_Peck._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletinus pictus. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE PAINTED BOLETINUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 313.--Boletinus pictus.]\r\n\r\nPictus, painted. This plant seems to delight in damp pine woods, but I\r\nhave found it only occasionally about Chillicothe, under beech trees. It\r\nis readily recognized by the red fibrillose tomentum which covers the\r\nentire plant when young. As the plant expands the reddish tomentum is\r\nbroken into scales of the same color, revealing the yellowish color of\r\nthe pileus beneath. The flesh is compact, yellow, often changing to a\r\ndull pinkish or reddish tint where wounded.\r\n\r\nThe tube-surface is at first pale yellow, but becomes darker with age,\r\noften changing to pinkish, with a brown tinge where bruised.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, equal, and covered with a cottony layer of\r\nmycelium-threads like the pileus, though often paler. The spores are\r\nochraceous, 15-18×6-8µ. The plants are two to four inches broad, and\r\none and a half to three inches high. Found from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletinus cavipes. Kalchb._\r\n\r\nHOLLOW-STEMMED BOLETINUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 314.--Boletinus cavipes.]\r\n\r\nCavipes is from two Latin words meaning a hollow stem.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is broadly convex, rather tough, flexible, soft, subumbonate,\r\nfibrillose-scaly, tawny-brown, sometimes tinged with reddish or\r\npurplish, flesh yellowish. The tubes are slightly decurrent, at first\r\npale-yellow, then darker and tinged with green, becoming\r\ndingy-ochraceous with age. The stem is equal or slightly tapering\r\nupward, somewhat fibrillose or floccose, slightly ringed, hollow,\r\ntawny-brown or yellowish-brown, yellowish at the top and marked by the\r\ndecurrent dissepiments of the tubes, white within. Veil whitish, partly\r\nadhering to the margin of the pileus, soon disappearing. The spores are\r\n8-10×4µ. _Peck_, in Boleti of the U. S.\r\n\r\nThis plant grows in New York and the New England states, under pine and\r\ntamarack trees. The caps are convex, covered with a tawny-brown\r\nfibrillose tomentum. The stems of those I have seen are hollow from the\r\nfirst. The plants in Figure 314 were sent me from Massachusetts by Mrs.\r\nBlackford.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Boletinus porosus._ (_Berk._) _Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 315.--Boletinus porosus. Two-thirds natural size.\r\nCaps nut-brown, yellowish-brown or olivaceous.]\r\n\r\nThese form a small but interesting species, not usually exceeding three\r\nand a half inches in diameter nor more than two inches in height.\r\n\r\nThe cap is somewhat fleshy, nut-brown, or yellowish-brown, shading to\r\nolivaceous in color in most of the specimens which I have found; when\r\nfresh and moist, somewhat sticky and shining. The margins are thin,\r\nrather even, and inclined to be involute; the shape of the cap is more\r\nor less irregular, in many cases almost kidney-shaped.\r\n\r\nThe stem is laterally attached, tough, and gradually expands into the\r\npileus which it resembles in color; it is markedly reticulated at the\r\ntop by the decurrent walls of the spore-tubes. The spore-surface is\r\nyellow, the tubes arranged in radiating rows, some being more prominent\r\nthan others, the partitions often assuming the form of gills which\r\nbranch and are connected by cross partitions of less prominence. The\r\nstratum of tubes, while soft, is very tenacious, not separating from the\r\nflesh of the pileus.\r\n\r\nThe odor and taste of all the specimens found were pleasant. Found in\r\ndamp woods in July and August. When a sufficient number can be found\r\nthey make an excellent dish.\r\n\r\nIt is found in abundance about Chillicothe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fistulina. Bull._\r\n\r\nFistulina means a small pipe; so called because the tubes stand close\r\ntogether and separate easily one from another.\r\n\r\nThe hymenophore is fleshy and hymenium inferior. When first seen\r\nspringing from a stump or root it looks like a large strawberry. It soon\r\ndevelops into the appearance of a big red tongue. When young the upper\r\nside is quite velvety and peach-colored, later it becomes a livid red\r\nand loses its velvety appearance. The under surface is flesh-colored and\r\nis rough like the surface of a tongue, owing to the fact that the tubes\r\nare free from one another. When it is moist it is very viscid, making\r\nyour hands quite blood-stained in appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fistulina hepatica. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE LIVER FUNGUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate XLIII. Figure 316.--Fistulina hepatica.\r\n\r\nBeefsteak mushroom.]\r\n\r\nThis is a beautiful plant, quite common where there are chestnut stumps\r\nand trees. I have found it on chestnut oak, quite large specimens, too.\r\nIt is one of my favorite mushrooms; one cannot afford to pass it by. Its\r\nbeautiful color will attract attention at once, and having once eaten it\r\nwell prepared, one will never pass a chestnut stump without examining\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 317.--Fistulina hepatica. One-half natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fan-shaped or semicircular, red-juicy, flesh when cut\r\nsomewhat mottled like beet-root and giving forth a very appetizing odor;\r\nthe cap is moist and somewhat viscid, the color varying from a red\r\n(somewhat beefy) to a reddish-brown in older plants; while the spore\r\nsurface varies from strawberry-pink through a light-and dark-tan to an\r\nalmost chestnut-brown.\r\n\r\nIn young plants the color is much richer and more vivid than in those of\r\ngreater maturity. The spore surface resembles nothing so much as a very\r\nfine sponge, the spore-tubes being short, crowded, yet distinct.\r\n\r\nThe marked peculiarity of its mode of growth is in the attachment of the\r\nstem; somewhat thick, fleshy, and juicy, coming from the side of the\r\npileus like the handle of a fan, it looks as if some one had taken hold\r\nof the cap and given it a partial twist to the right or to the left, as\r\nmay be seen in Figure 317. Another peculiarity I have noticed in this\r\nspecies consists of the nerve-like lines, or veinlets, radiating from\r\nthe stem and streaking the upper surface of the cap. The taste, when\r\nraw, is slightly but pleasantly acid. Its favorite habitat seems to be\r\ninjured places on chestnut trees, and about chestnut stumps. It is known\r\nas Liver Fungus, Beefsteak Fungus, Oak-Tongue, Chestnut-Tongue, etc. It\r\nis found from July to October.\r\n\r\nI have found it plentiful about Chillicothe on chestnut stumps, and\r\nquite generally over the state. I found some very fine specimens on the\r\nchestnut oaks, about Bowling Green, Ohio.\r\n\r\nWhen properly prepared it is equal to any kind of meat. It is one of our\r\nbest mushrooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fistulina pallida. B. and Rav._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 318.--Fistulina pallida. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nPallida means pale. Pileus kidney-shaped, pallid-red, fawn or\r\nclay-color, thick at the base and thinning toward the margin, which is\r\noften crenate and inflexed; pulverulent, firm, flexible, tough; flesh\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nThe tubes are long and slender, mouths somewhat enlarged, whitish, the\r\ntube surface a pale cream-color and minutely mealy, pores not decurrent\r\nbut ending with the beginning of the stem.\r\n\r\nThe stem is uniformly attached to the concave margin of the cap;\r\nattenuated downward; whitish below, but near the cap it changes to the\r\nsame tint. The peculiar manner of attachment of the stem will serve to\r\nidentify the species, which I have found several times near Chillicothe.\r\nThe specimen in the illustration was found on the State farm, and\r\nphotographed by Dr. Kellerman.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus. Fr._\r\n\r\nPolyporus is from two Greek words meaning many and pores. In this genus\r\nthe stratum of the pores is not easily separated from the cap. Most of\r\nthe species under this genus are tough and corky. Many grow on decayed\r\nwood, a few on the ground, but even these are inclined to be tough. Very\r\nfew of those growing on wood have a central stem and many have\r\napparently no stem at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus picipes. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE BLACK-FOOTED POLYPORUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 319.--Polyporus picipes. Two-thirds natural size.\r\nNote the black stem, which gives name to the species.]\r\n\r\nPicipes is from _pix_, pitch or black, and _pes_, foot.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, rigid, coriaceous, tough, even, smooth, depressed\r\neither behind or in the center; livid with a chestnut-colored disk.\r\n\r\nThe pores are decurrent, rounded, small, tender, white, finally\r\nreddish-gray.\r\n\r\nThe stem is eccentric and lateral, equal, firm; at first velvety, then\r\nnaked; punctate with black dots, becoming black.\r\n\r\nThe stem at the base is pitch-black, as will be seen in Figure 319. The\r\nmargin of the cap is very thin and the caps are irregularly funnel-form.\r\nThis plant is widely distributed over the United States and is quite\r\ncommon about Chillicothe. Found in damp woods on decayed logs from July\r\nto November. When very young and tender it can be eaten.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus umbellatus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE SUN-SHADE POLYPORUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate XLIV. Figure 320.--Polyporus umbellatus.]\r\n\r\nUmbellatus is from _umbella_, a sun-shade. Very much branched,\r\nfibrous-fleshy, toughish. The pileoli are very numerous, one-half to one\r\nand a half inches broad, sooty, dull-red, united at the base. Pores are\r\nminute and white. White pileoli have sometimes occurred. _Fries._\r\n\r\nThe tufts, as will be observed from Figure 320, are very dense, and\r\nthere seems to be no limit to their branching. Notice that every cap is\r\ndepressed or umbilicate. The specimen in Figure 320 was collected near\r\nMammoth Cave, Kentucky, by Mr. C. G. Lloyd, Cincinnati, and through his\r\ncourtesy I have used his print. I have found the plant about Chillicothe\r\nand Sidney, Ohio. It is found on decayed roots on the ground, or on\r\nstumps. When the caps are fresh they are quite good.\r\n\r\nMay to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus frondosus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE BRANCHED POLYPORUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 321.--Polyporus frondosus. One-fifth natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nFrondosus, full of leafy branches. The tufts are from six inches to over\r\na foot broad, very much branched, fibrous-fleshy, toughish.\r\n\r\nThe pileoli are very numerous, one-half to two inches broad, sooty-gray,\r\ndimidiate, wrinkled, lobed, intricately recurved. Flesh white. Stems,\r\ngrowing into each other, white.\r\n\r\nThe pores are rather tender, very small, acute, white, commonly round,\r\nbut in oblique position, gaping open and torn. _Fries._\r\n\r\nThe specimen in Figure 321 was found near Chillicothe. When tender it is\r\nvery good. Found on stumps and roots from September till the coming of\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\nWe are told that in the Roman markets this mushroom is frequently sold\r\nas an article of food.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus leucomelas. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 322.--Polyporus leucomelas.]\r\n\r\nLeucomelas is from two Greek words, _leucos_, white, and _melas_, black.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to four inches broad, fleshy, somewhat fragile,\r\nirregularly shaped, silky, sooty-black; flesh soft, reddish when broken.\r\n\r\nThe pores are rather large, unequal, ashy or whitish, becoming black\r\nwhen drying.\r\n\r\nThe stem is one to three inches long, stout, unequal, somewhat\r\ntomentose, sooty-black, becoming black internally. The pileus and stem\r\nbecome black in places.\r\n\r\nThe spores are cylindric-fusoid, pale-brown, 10-12×4-5µ.\r\n\r\nThey are usually found in pine woods. The caps are often deformed and\r\nare easily broken. The pores resemble those of a Boletus. The plant is\r\nquite widely distributed. The one in Figure 322 was found in\r\nMassachusetts by Mrs. Blackford, and I photographed it after it was\r\npartially dry. It is probably the same as P. griseus, P.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus Berkeleyi. Fr._\r\n\r\nBERKELEY'S POLYPORUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nThe pileoli are fleshy, tough, becoming hard and corky, many times\r\nimbricated, sometimes growing very large, with many in a head;\r\nsubzonate, finally tomentose; the plant very much branched, alutaceous.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short or entirely wanting, arising from a long and thick\r\ncaudex.\r\n\r\nThe pore surface is very large, the pores are large and irregular,\r\nangular, pale-yellowish.\r\n\r\nI have seen some very large specimens of this species. The natural size\r\nof the specimen in Figure 323 is two and one-fourth feet across. When\r\nyoung it is edible, but not equal to P. sulphureus. It is found growing\r\non the ground near trees and stumps, and is a widely distributed plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 323.--Polyporus Berkeleyi. One-fifth natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate XLV. Figure 324.--Polyporus Berkeleyi.\r\n\r\nReduced. Natural size being 2½ feet across.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus giganteus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE GIANT POLYPORUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nGiganteus is from _gigas_, a giant. The pileoli are very numerous,\r\nimbricated, fleshy, tough, somewhat coriaceous, flaccid, somewhat zoned;\r\ncolor a grayish-brown in young specimens, the deep cream pore surfaces\r\ntipping the pileoli, rendering it a very attractive plant; this\r\ncream-color is quickly changed to black or deep-brown by touching it.\r\n\r\nThe pores are minute, shallow, round, pallid, at length torn.\r\n\r\nThe stem is branched, connate from a common tuber.\r\n\r\nThis is a large and certainly a very attractive plant, being very often\r\ntwo to three feet across. When young and tender it is edible. Found\r\ngrowing on decayed stumps and roots, it is somewhat common in our state.\r\nI have found some quite large specimens about Chillicothe. It is easily\r\ndistinguished by its pore surface turning black or dark-brown to the\r\ntouch. When young and tender it makes a good stew, but it must be well\r\ncooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus squamosus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE SCALY POLYPORUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 325.--Polyporus squamosus. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nSquamosus means abounding in scales. The pileus is from three to\r\neighteen inches broad, fleshy, fan-shaped, expanded, flattened, somewhat\r\nochraceous, variegated, with scattered, brown, adpressed scales.\r\n\r\nThe stem is eccentric and lateral, blunt, reticulated at apex, blackish\r\nat the base.\r\n\r\nThe pores are thin, variable; at first minute, then broad, angular and\r\ntorn; pallid. Spores are white and elliptical, 14×6µ.\r\n\r\nIt is found from Massachusetts to Iowa, and grows very large. Specimens\r\nhave been reported seven feet in circumference and attaining a weight of\r\n40 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe specimen in Figure 325 was found by Mr. C. G. Lloyd in the woods at\r\nRed Bank, near Cincinnati. It is quite a common plant in Europe.\r\n\r\nIt is tough, but it is prepared for eating by being cut fine and stewed\r\nfor a half hour or more.\r\n\r\nIn Figure 325 the angular and torn pores are obvious, as well as the\r\nscales which give rise to its name. Found on trunks and stumps from May\r\nto November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus sulphureus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE SULPHUR-COLORED POLYPORUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate XLVI. Figure 326.--Polyporus sulphureus.]\r\n\r\nSulphureus, pertaining to sulphur, so called from the color of the\r\ntube-bearing surface. In mature specimens the growth is horizontal,\r\nspreading fan-like from the stem, undulating with radiating flutings.\r\nThe upper surface is salmon, orange, or orange-red; flesh cheesy,\r\nlight-yellow, the edge being smooth and unevenly thickened with\r\nnodule-like prominences. In young specimens the ascending, under yellow\r\nsurface outwardly exposed.\r\n\r\nThe pore surface is a bright sulphur-yellow, which is more persistent\r\nthan the color of the cap; pores very minute, short, often formed of\r\ninflexed masses.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, a mere close attachment for the spreading growth. The\r\ntaste is slightly acid and mucilaginous when raw. The spores are\r\nelliptical and white, 7-8×4-5µ.\r\n\r\nIt grows on decayed logs, on stumps, and on decayed places in living\r\ntrees. The mycelium of this species will frequently be found in the\r\nhearts of trees and remain there for years before the tree is injured\r\nsufficiently for the mycelium to come to the surface. It may take\r\nmonths, or a century, to accomplish this.\r\n\r\nWhen this plant is young and tender it is a prime favorite with all who\r\nknow it. It is found from August to November. Its favorite host is an\r\noak stump or log.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus flavovirens. B. & Rav._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 327.--Polyporus flavovirens. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nFlavovirens means yellowish-green or olivaceous.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is quite large, three to six inches broad, convex, expanded\r\nfunnel-form or repand, fleshy, tomentose, yellowish-green or olivaceous;\r\nfrequently the pileus is cracked when old; flesh white.\r\n\r\nThe pores are not large, toothed, white or whitish, decurrent upon the\r\nstem which is tapering.\r\n\r\nThis plant is very common on the oak hillsides about Chillicothe. The\r\nplants in Figure 327 were found by Miss Margaret Mace on the Governor\r\nTiffin farm, about twelve miles north of Chillicothe, growing in large\r\ngroups under oak trees. It is edible though often tough. It is found in\r\nAugust and September. It is very abundant in this region.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus heteroclitus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE BOUQUET POLYPORUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 328.--Polyporus heteroclitus. One-fourth natural\r\nsize. The Pileoli bright orange.]\r\n\r\nHeteroclitus is from two Greek words; one of two and to lean, referring\r\nto its habit of growth, leaning apparently upon the ground or the base\r\nof a tree or stump. It is cæspitose and coriaceous. The pileoli are two\r\nand a half inches broad, orange and sessile, expanded on all sides from\r\nthe radical tubercle, lobed, villous, zoneless.\r\n\r\nThe pores are irregularly shaped and elongated, golden yellow. _Fries._\r\n\r\nThe specimen in Figure 328 was found by Mr. Beyerly at Richmond Dale,\r\nOhio. It was over a foot in diameter and eight inches high, growing in\r\nmany cæspitose layers, on the ground under an oak tree, from a radical\r\ntubercle. The flesh was juicy and tender, breaking easily. The radical\r\ntubercle from which it grew was filled with a milky juice. The flesh was\r\nsomewhat lighter in color than the outside pilei, which extended\r\nhorizontally from the tubercle. It is a very showy and attractive plant,\r\nand as Captain McIlvaine remarks, it looks like a \"mammoth dahlia\" in\r\nbloom. When young and tender it is good, but in age it becomes rank.\r\nThis plant was found July 1st. It grows in the months of June and July.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus radicatus. Schw._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 329.--Polyporus radicatus. One-third natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nRadicatus, from the long root the plant has. The pileus is fleshy, quite\r\ntough, cushion-shaped, slightly depressed, pale sooty, somewhat downy.\r\n\r\nThe pores are decurrent, quite large, obtuse, equal, white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is very long, often eccentric, tapering downward, sometimes\r\nventricose as in Figure 329, rooting quite deep, black below.\r\n\r\nIt is found on the ground in the woods and in old clearings beside old\r\ntrees and stumps.\r\n\r\nThe blackish or brown pileus, which is more or less tomentose, with a\r\nblack stem more or less deformed, will serve to distinguish the species.\r\nFound from September to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus perplexus. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 330.--Polyporus perplexus. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nThe pileus is spongy-fleshy, fibrous, sessile, commonly imbricated, and\r\nsomewhat confluent, irregular, hairy-tomentose to setose-hispid,\r\ngrayish-tawny, or ferruginous, the margin subacute, sterile, the\r\nsubstance within tawny-ferruginous, somewhat zonate.\r\n\r\nThe pores are two to three lines long, unequal, angular, the\r\ndissepiments becoming brownish-ferruginous with age or where bruised.\r\nThe spores are ferruginous, broadly elliptical, .00024 to .0003 inch\r\nlong and about .0002 broad. _Peck._\r\n\r\nThis is very abundant on beech logs, growing quite large, massive,\r\nimbricated, and confluent, the pileoli being often two to four inches\r\nbroad. It is very closely related to P. cuticularis and P. hispidus. It\r\ncan be easily distinguished from P. cuticularis by means of its straight\r\nmargin, and from P. hispidus by its small size and smaller pores. Found\r\nfrom September to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus hispidus. Fr._\r\n\r\nPileus is very large, eight to ten inches broad and three to four inches\r\nthick, compact, spongy, fleshy but fibrous, dimidiate, with occasionally\r\na very short stem; generally very hairy, but sometimes smooth; the\r\npileus is often marked with concentric lines which seem to indicate\r\narrested vegetation; brown, blackish, yellowish or reddish brown, below\r\npale-yellow or rich sienna-brown, margin paler.\r\n\r\nThe pores are minute, round, inclined to separate, fringed, paler. The\r\nspores are yellowish, apiculate, 10×7µ. Often found on living trees, the\r\nplant gains entrance to the living stem through the bark, by means of a\r\nwound made by some agency, as a bird or a boring insect; soon a mass of\r\nmycelium is formed, and from this the fruiting body is produced.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus cuticularis. Fr._\r\n\r\nPileus is quite thin, spongy, fleshy, then dry; plane, hairy-tomentose,\r\nferruginous, then blackish-brown; margin fibrous, fimbriate, internally\r\nloose and parallel, fibrous.\r\n\r\nThe pores are long, quite small, pale, then ochraceous; pores longer\r\nthan the thickness of the flesh. The spores are yellow or ochraceous,\r\nvery abundant, 7×4-5µ. The hairs on the pileus are three-cleft.\r\n\r\nThis is very frequent in beech woods about Chillicothe. Found in\r\nSeptember and October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus circinatus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE ROUND POLYPORUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nCircinatus is from _circinus_, a pair of compasses, hence means rounded\r\nlike a circle.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is three to four inches across, with a double cap, one cap\r\nwithin another, both being compact, thick, round, plane, zoneless,\r\nvelvety, rusty-yellow to reddish-brown, the flesh being of the same\r\ncolor. The upper cap is pliable, compact, soft, and covered with a soft\r\ntomentum, the lower cap, contiguous with the stem, is woody and corky.\r\n\r\nThe pores are decurrent, extending down the stem, entire, rather small,\r\ndusky-gray.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short and rather thick, often swollen, covered with a\r\nreddish-brown tomentum.\r\n\r\nThis is an odd but handsome species and easily determined because of its\r\ndouble cap. It is said to prefer fir woods, but I have frequently found\r\nit in oak woods. It grows on the ground, and when young and fresh the\r\npilei are said to be good. I have never found more than one specimen at\r\na time and never in a condition to eat, though good authorities say it\r\nis edible when young and tender. Found in September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus adustus. Fr._\r\n\r\nAdustus means scorched, so called from the blackish color of margin.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is often imbricated; fleshy, tough, firm, thin, villous,\r\nash-color; margin straight, blackish.\r\n\r\nThe pores are minute, round, obtuse, whitish, soon ashy-brown.\r\n\r\nIt is abundant everywhere on fallen beech or on beech stumps. It is very\r\nclose to P. fumosus if it is not identical with it. It is found from\r\nAugust to late fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus resinosus._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 331.--Polyporus resinosus. One-fourth natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nPileus from three to six, and frequently eight, inches long; rich-brown,\r\nvarying from bright cinnamon to red, handsomely marked with delicate\r\npencilings radiating from the axis of growth; the color of the pileus\r\nseems to form a binding about the edge of the light-gray pore surface,\r\nwhich is closely punctured with minute elliptical pores.\r\n\r\nThe color of the pore surface readily changes to brown upon slight\r\npressure. The whole plant is full of a brownish juice which exudes\r\nfreely upon pressure. The plant is shelving and imbricated upon the side\r\nof a log, without any apparent stem.\r\n\r\nTaken altogether the Polyporus resinosus presents one of the handsomest\r\nspecimens of fungus growth that one will be likely to find in a long\r\nday's tramp. When fresh and growing it has rather a pleasant taste.\r\n\r\nIt is found during October and November, growing on decayed logs, being\r\npartial to the beech. Its abundance is equal to its beauty.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus lucidus. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 332.--Polyporus lucidus. One-third natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to three or more inches broad, usually very irregular,\r\nbrownish-maroon, with a distinct double zone of duller dark-brown and\r\ntan. Cap glazed especially in the center, wrinkled.\r\n\r\nThe spore surface is a very light grayish-brown in the young plant,\r\nchanging to almost a tan in older ones, pores labyrinthiform.\r\n\r\nThe stem is irregular, knotted and swollen with protuberances somewhat\r\nresembling buds, from which develop the caps which in some cases appear\r\nas if stuck on the stem like barnacles on a stick. Contrary to most\r\nmushrooms the upper surface of the cap and the stem are of nearly the\r\nsame color, the stem being usually of a more brilliant red. The stem has\r\na distinct root extending into the ground several inches. The whole\r\nplant is almost indescribably irregular. It is quite an attractive plant\r\nwhen seen growing among the weeds and beside stumps. The plants in\r\nFigure 332 I found growing among Datura stramonium beside old stumps in\r\na pasture. I have found the same species growing on oak stumps. It is\r\nknown as Ganoderma Curtisii, Berk., G. pseudo-boletus, Merrill. It is\r\nfound from August till late fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus obliquus. Pers._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 333.--Polyporus obliquus. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nObliquus means slanting, oblique. This species is widely circumfused,\r\nusually hard, quite thick, uneven, pallid, elegant chocolate-brown, then\r\nblackish; conversely encircled crested border.\r\n\r\nThe pores are long, very minute, obtuse, slightly angular. It grows on\r\ndead branches of iron-wood and wild cherry. The deep chocolate-brown and\r\nthe oblique form of its pores will serve to identify the species.\r\n\r\nIt grows, with us, in the spring. I gathered this specimen in June. In\r\nthe fall I visited the same trunk, but found they had begun to decay. It\r\nis sometimes called Poria obliqua.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus graveolens. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 334.--Polyporus graveolens.]\r\n\r\nGraveolens means strong scented. Corky or woody and extremely hard, very\r\nclosely imbricated and connate, forming a subglobose polycephalous mass,\r\nFigure 334. Pileoli innumerable, inflexed and appressed, plicate, brown.\r\n\r\nPores concealed, very minute, round, pale-brown, the dissepiments thick\r\nand obtuse. _Morgan._\r\n\r\nThis is a very interesting plant because of its peculiar mode of growth.\r\nIt is found in woods or clearings on dead logs or on standing dead\r\ntrees. In some parts of the state it is quite common. From the\r\nillustration, Figure 334, it will be seen that the plant consists of an\r\ninnumerable number of pileoli forming a subglobose or elongated mass.\r\nThey are frequently three to six inches in diameter and several inches\r\nlong. I have seen them very much elongated on standing trees. When it is\r\nyoung and growing it is shiny in appearance and has a reddish and\r\nsometimes a purplish tint. The inner substance is ferruginous but\r\ncovered with a hard brown crust. The pores are brown, and when examined\r\nwith the glass are seen to be lined with a very fine pubescence. The\r\nimbricated form of the pileoli show very plainly in the illustration.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus brumalis. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE WINTER POLYPORUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 335.--Polyporus brumalis.]\r\n\r\nBrumalis is from _bruma_, which means winter; so called because it\r\nappears late, in cold weather. The specimens in Figure 335 were found in\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is from one to three inches broad, nearly plane, slightly\r\ndepressed in the center; somewhat fleshy and tough; dingy-brown, clothed\r\nwith minute scales, becoming smooth, pallid.\r\n\r\nThe pores are oval, slightly angular, slender, acute, denticulate,\r\nwhite, 5-6×2µ.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, thin, slightly bulbous at the base, hirsute or\r\nsquamulose, pale, central.\r\n\r\nIt usually occurs singly but frequently you will find several in a\r\ngroup. Found on sticks and logs, they are quite hard to detach from\r\ntheir hosts. Too tough to eat. It equals Polyporus polyporus. (Retz)\r\nMerrill.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus rufescens. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE RUFESCENT POLYPORUS.\r\n\r\nRufescens, becoming red. The pileus is flesh-colored, spongy, soft,\r\nunequal, hairy or woolly.\r\n\r\nThe pores are large, sinuose and torn, white or flesh-colored.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, irregular, tuberous at the base. Spores elliptical,\r\n6×4-5µ.\r\n\r\nRather common about Chillicothe on the ground about old stumps.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus arcularius. Batsch._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 336.--Polyporus arcularius. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize, showing dark brown and depressed center; also dark brown stems.]\r\n\r\nThe pileus is dark-brown, minutely scaly, depressed in the center,\r\nmargin covered with stiff hairs.\r\n\r\nThe tube surface is of a dingy cream color, openings oblong, almost\r\ndiamond-shaped, resembling the meshes of a net, the meshes being smaller\r\non the margin, shallow, simply marked out at the top of the stem.\r\n\r\nThe stem is dark-brown, minutely scaly, mottled, with a ground work of\r\ncream-color; hollow. Common in the spring of the year on sticks and\r\ndecayed wood in fields or in old clearings. It is quite generally\r\ndistributed. Edible but tough.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus elegans. Fr._\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, soon becoming woody; expanded, even, smooth,\r\npallid.\r\n\r\nPores are plane, minute, nearly round, pallid, yellowish-white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is eccentric, even, smooth, pallid; base from the first\r\nabruptly black. This is quite common on rotten wood in the forests. It\r\nresembles P. picipes both in appearance and habitat.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus medulla-panis. Fr._\r\n\r\nEffused, determinate, subundulate, firm, smooth, white, circumference\r\nnaked, submarginate, wholly composed of middle sized, rather long,\r\nentire pores, the whole becoming yellowish in age.\r\n\r\nI found this species on an elm log along Ralston's Run.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus albellus. Pk._\r\n\r\nThe pileus is thick, sessile, convex or subungulate, subsolitary, two to\r\nfour inches broad, one to one and a half thick, fleshy, rather soft; the\r\nadnate cuticle rather thin, smooth or sometimes slightly roughened by a\r\nslight strigose tomentum, especially toward the margin; whitish, tinged\r\nmore or less with fuscus; flesh pure white, odor acidulous.\r\n\r\nThe pores are nearly plane, minute, subrotund, about two lines long;\r\nwhite, inclining to yellowish, the dissepiments thin, acute.\r\n\r\nThe spores are minute, cylindrical, curved, white, .00016 to .0002 inch\r\nlong. _Peck._\r\n\r\nThis species is quite common here and is very widely distributed in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus epileucus. Fr._\r\n\r\nThis is quite a large and beautiful plant. It apparently grows without a\r\nstem, its color being an unequal gray. The pileus is somewhat\r\ncoriaceous, firm, pulvinate, villous.\r\n\r\nThe pores are round, elongated, obtuse, entire, white.\r\n\r\nThis is not common with us, but I have met it a few times and always on\r\nelm logs or stumps.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus betulinus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE BIRCH POLYPORUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 337.--Polyporus betulinus.]\r\n\r\nBetulinus is from _betulina_, birch.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is from four to ten inches across, fleshy, soon corky,\r\nungulate, obtuse, smooth, pale reddish-brown when mature, often mottled,\r\nroundish, or somewhat reniform, zoneless, the oblique vertex in the\r\nform of an umbo; pellicle thin, separating; flesh white, very thick.\r\n\r\nThe pores are short, round, minute, unequal, separable from the pileus\r\nwhen fresh, but really concrete with it; white or tinged with brown,\r\ndeveloping slowly; when mature there are peculiar hair-like scales\r\nattached to the pore-surface, making the plant look like a Hydnum when\r\nviewed from the side. It is found wherever the birch tree grows. When\r\nyoung and fresh it is edible, but with a strong flavor unpleasant to\r\nmany. In this state the deer eat it. The specimen in Figure 337 was\r\nfound in Wisconsin, and photographed by Dr. Kellerman. This species is\r\nthe Piptoporus suberosus (L.) of Merrill.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus cinnabarinus. Schw._\r\n\r\nCINNABAR POLYPORUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 338.--Polyporus cinnabarinus. One-third natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nCinnabarinus like cinnabar (vermilion). The pileus is dry, more or less\r\nspongy, pliant, rather thick, fibrous on top; flesh light or\r\nyellowish-red, shelving.\r\n\r\nThe pores are carmine, quite small, round, entire.\r\n\r\nThis species is quite common in the woods about Chillicothe. It is\r\neasily identified by the beautiful carmine color of the pileus and the\r\npore surface, the latter being a shade darker than the former, as will\r\nbe seen in Figure 338.\r\n\r\nThe specimens photographed were found in December. They grow on dead\r\nlogs and branches, commonly on the oak and wild cherry, sometimes on\r\nmaple. It is called by some authors Trametes cinnabarina.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus vulgaris. Fr._\r\n\r\nCOMMON EFFUSED POLYPORUS.\r\n\r\nVulgaris, common. Quite broadly effused, very thin, adheres closely to\r\nits host; even, white, dry. Circumference soon smooth and the whole\r\nsurface composed of firm, crowded, small, round, nearly equal pores.\r\n\r\nEffused on dead wood, fallen branches, and frequently on moist boards.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus lacteus. Fr._\r\n\r\nThe pileus is white, or whitish, fleshy, somewhat fibrous, fragile,\r\ntriangular in form, pubescent, azonate, margin somewhat inflexed, acute.\r\n\r\nThe pores are thin, acute, dentate, finally lacerate and labyrinthiform.\r\n\r\nThis species is found in the woods, on beech logs. It is small and thin,\r\nnot much more than an inch in width but sometimes elongated. Steep and\r\ngibbous behind, becoming at length smooth and equal. It is not abundant\r\nin our woods, but I have found it often. August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus cæsius. Schrad._\r\n\r\nThe pileus is white, with a bluish tinge occasionally upon its surface,\r\nsoft, tenacious, unequal, silky.\r\n\r\nThe pores are small, unequal, long, flexuous, dentate, lacerate.\r\n\r\nIt is found in woods on partially decayed sticks. I have only\r\noccasionally found a specimen in our woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus pubescens. Schw._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 339.--Polyporus pubescens. White without and\r\nwithin, pubescent and shiny.]\r\n\r\nPubescens means downy; so called from the satiny finish of its pileus,\r\nwhich is fleshy, quite tough and corky, soft, convex, subzonate,\r\npubescent and shiny; white without and within; the margin acute,\r\nbecoming at length yellowish and hard, with a shiny lustre.\r\n\r\nThe pores are short, minute, nearly round and plane.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is from one to two inches in width, laterally confluent and\r\nusually very much imbricated. Quite plentiful in woods on beech logs.\r\nJuly to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus volvatus. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 340.--Polyporus volvatus. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nVolvatus, bearing a volva. This is a most interesting species. The\r\npileus seems to be prolonged, making a volva-like protection of the\r\nspore surface. When this volva is ruptured small heaps of spores will\r\noften be seen on the volva, having been protected from the wind.\r\n\r\nThe plant is small, somewhat round, and before the volva is ruptured it\r\nis very like a puffball; fleshy, smooth, attached by a small point,\r\nwhitish, slightly tinged with yellow, red or reddish-brown; the cuticle\r\nof the pileus enveloping the entire pore-surface, thick and firm. The\r\npores are rather long, small, the mouths yellowish, with a tinge of\r\nbrown. The spores are elliptical and flesh-colored, .0003 to .00035 inch\r\nlong and about .0002 broad.\r\n\r\nThis plant has a wide distribution, being found in the New England and\r\nEastern States, and the States of the Pacific slope. I presume it will\r\nbe found wherever the spruce tree is a native.\r\n\r\nThe specimens in Figure 340 were found near Boston and were sent me\r\nabout the first of May by Mrs. Blackford. The first package I took,\r\nbefore examining them, to be a new puffball, which they seemed to\r\nresemble in their undeveloped state.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polystictus biformis. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 341.--Polystictus biformis. Natural size.\r\nFrequently covered with green lichen.]\r\n\r\nBiformis means two shapes or appearances; referring to the condition of\r\nthe pores in the young and the old plant.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to three inches wide, projecting from one to three\r\ninches, often imbricated so as to cover a large surface; laterally\r\nconfluent, coriaceous, flexible, tough, subzonate, with innate radiating\r\nfibres, the cortex fibrillose, concolorous.\r\n\r\nThe pores at first very large, simple, compound, or confluent, round,\r\nelongated, flexuous; the dissepiments dentate, then lacerate, the\r\nhymenium finally resolved into teeth.\r\n\r\nWhen I first found this plant the hymenium had resolved into teeth, and\r\nI supposed that I had found an Irpex. It is found in woods on logs and\r\nstumps. Very common with us. Frequently covered with a green lichen.\r\nJuly to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polystictus hirsutus. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE BRISTLY POLYSTICTUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 342.--Polystictus hirsutus. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nHirsutus means hairy or bristly. The pileus is corky, coriaceous,\r\nconvex, then plane, hairy with rigid bristles, zoned with concentric\r\nfurrows; of one color, whitish, sometimes these zones are quite marked\r\nas in Figure 342.\r\n\r\nThe pore surface is at first white, or whitish, becoming dark or\r\nbrownish in age. The pores are round, the walls rather thick. It is\r\nfound on logs and stumps in the woods. It is a very common plant and\r\nwidely distributed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polystictus versicolor. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON ZONED POLYSTICTUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 343.--Polystictus versicolor. One-half natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nVersicolor means varying colors. The pileus is coriaceous, thin, rigid,\r\nplane, depressed behind; quite velvety, nearly even and shining,\r\nvariegated with colored zones, sometimes entirely white or\r\ngrayish-white, not unfrequently the whole surface is villous or woolly,\r\nand the zones mere depressions.\r\n\r\nThe pores are minute, round, acute, lacerated, white or cream-color.\r\n\r\nIt is very common, as well as very variable in form and color. It is\r\nfrequently found on logs and is then densely imbricated. On our\r\nhillsides it frequently grows on a small bush as in Figure 343. It is\r\none of the most beautiful plants in the woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polyporus gilvus. Schw._\r\n\r\nGilvus means pale-yellow or deep-reddish flesh-color.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is corky, woody, hard, effuso-reflexed, imbricate,\r\nconcrescent, subtomentose, then scabrous, uneven, reddish-yellow, then\r\nsubferruginous, the margin acute.\r\n\r\nThe pores are minute, round, entire, brownish-ferruginous. _Morgan._\r\n\r\nIt is very abundant throughout the state, being found on all kinds of\r\nlogs and stumps.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polystictus cinnamoneus. Jacq._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 344.--Polystictus cinnamoneus.]\r\n\r\nThe pileus is an inch and a half, or less, broad, coriaceous, slightly\r\ndepressed in the center; rather rough on the surface, but with a\r\nbeautiful satiny lustre, and more or less zoned; caps often growing\r\ntogether, but with separate stems; shining, a light cinnamon-brown.\r\n\r\nThe spores are rather large, angular, torn with age; cinnamon-brown,\r\ngrowing darker in older plants.\r\n\r\nThe stem is one to two inches long, equal, or slightly tapering upward,\r\ncinnamon-brown, hollow or stuffed, tough, frequently sending forth\r\nbranches from the side and base of the stem.\r\n\r\nThis is quite a beautiful plant, growing usually in patches of moss. The\r\ncaps have quite a glossy cinnamon-brown surface, which will attract the\r\nattention of any one. They are very small and easily overlooked. Found\r\nin August and September.\r\n\r\nThis plant is called P. subsericeus by Dr. Peck.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polystictus perennis. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate XLVII. Figure 346.--Polystictus perennis.]\r\n\r\nThe pileus is thin, pliant when fresh but somewhat brittle when dry. It\r\nis minutely velvety on the upper surface, reddish-brown or cinnamon in\r\ncolor; expanded or umbilicate to nearly funnel-shaped. The surface is\r\nbeautifully marked by radiations and fine concentric zones.\r\n\r\nThe stem is also velvety. The spore-tubes are minute, the walls thin and\r\nacute, and the mouths angular, and at last more or less torn. The margin\r\nof the cap is finely fimbriate, but in old specimens those hairs are apt\r\nto become rubbed off. _Atkinson._\r\n\r\nI found specimens by the roadside near Lone Tree Hill, near Chillicothe.\r\nIt is the only place in which I have found this plant. I have found\r\nPolystictus subsericeus, or, as Prof. Atkinson calls it, P. cinnamomeus,\r\nin a number of localities.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polystictus pergamenus. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 345.--Polystictus pergamenus.]\r\n\r\nPergamenus means parchment.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is coriaceous, thin, effused, reflexed, villous, zoned,\r\ncinereous-white, with colored zone; pliant when fresh.\r\n\r\nThe pores are unequal, torn, violaceous, then pallid. It is very common\r\nhere on beech, maple, and wild cherry. The pores become torn so that\r\nthey resemble the teeth of the Hydnum. This is one of the most common\r\nfungi in our woods.\r\n\r\nThe photograph is by Prof. J. D. Smith, of Akron, O.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fomes leucophæus. Mont._\r\n\r\nThis has been called by many authors in America Fomes applanatus or\r\nPolyporus applanatus. It is very common in this country but very rare in\r\nEurope, while Fomes applanatus, which is common in Europe, is very\r\nscarce in the United States. In general appearance they are much alike,\r\nthe applanatus having a softer tissue and echinulate spores, but our\r\ncommon species, leucophæus, has smooth spores.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is expanded, tuberculose, obsoletely zoned, pulverulent, or\r\nsmooth; cinnamon, becoming whitish; cuticle crustaceous, rigid, at\r\nlength fragile, very soft within; loosely floccose, margin tumid; white,\r\nthen cinnamon. The pores are very small, slightly ferruginous, orifice\r\nwhitish, brownish when bruised. The spore surface when fresh is soft and\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nThis attractive plant is very common in our woods and furnishes an\r\nexcellent stencil surface for drawing. Found all the year round.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fomes fomentarius. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE BRACKET FOMES.\r\n\r\nThis species is very common in our woods. The brackets resemble a\r\nhorse's hoof in shape. They are smoky, gray, and of various shades of\r\nbrown. The upper surface of the bracket is quite strongly zoned and\r\nfurrowed, so as to show each year's growth. The margin is thick and\r\nblunt, and the tube surface is concave; the openings of the tubes quite\r\nlarge, so that they can be readily seen by the naked eye. The tube\r\nsurface is reddish-brown when mature. The inside was formerly used in\r\nmaking tinder-sticks, which were made by rolling the fungus wood until\r\nit was perfectly flexible and then dipping it into saltpetre.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fomes rimosus. Berkeley._\r\n\r\nCRACKED FOMES.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 347.--Fomes rimosus.]\r\n\r\nRimosus means cracked. The fine checks in the pileus are clearly seen in\r\nthe halftone.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is pulvinate-ungulate, much dilated, deeply sulcate;\r\ncinnamon, then brown or blackish; very much cracked or rimose. It is\r\nvery hard, fibrous, tawny-ferruginous; the margin broad,\r\npruinate-velvety, rather acute.\r\n\r\nThe pores are minute, indistinctly stratified, tawny-ferruginous, the\r\nmouths rhubarb-color. _Morgan._\r\n\r\nThis plant is very common on the locust trees about Chillicothe. I have\r\nnever found it on other wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fomes pinicola. (Swartz.) Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 348.--Fomes pinicola.]\r\n\r\nPinicola means dwelling on pine. It is found on dead pine, spruce,\r\nbalsam, and other conifers. It resembles Fomes leucophæus but is\r\nsomewhat stouter and does not have as hard and firm a crust. The young\r\ngrowth is at the margin, and is whitish or tinged with yellow, while the\r\nold zones are reddish. The tube surface is whitish-yellow or yellowish.\r\nThis is frequently called Polyporus pinicolus. (Swartz.) Fr.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fomes igniarius. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 349.--Fomes igniarius.]\r\n\r\nThis is rather a common species in our state; black or brownish-black in\r\ncolor, somewhat triangular in shape, and frequently hoof-shaped. The\r\nzones indicating the yearly growth are plainly marked, and the tubes are\r\nquite long and of a dark brown color. Their growth is rather slow, and\r\nit requires years to produce some of the moderate sized specimens. Prof.\r\nAtkinson of Cornell University found a specimen which he believed to be\r\nover 80 years old.\r\n\r\nThis is called by many authors Polyporus igniarius (L.), Fr. Murrill\r\ncalls it Pyropolyporus igniarius. This plant is widely distributed over\r\nthe United States, and is met frequently in every wood in Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fomes fraxinophilus. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 350.--Fomes fraxinophilus.]\r\n\r\nFraxinophilus means ash-loving; rather common in this country, but does\r\nnot grow in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is between corky and woody, smooth, somewhat flattened, at\r\nfirst zoneless; white when young, then reddish-brown, white around the\r\nmargin; at first even, then concentrically sulcate, pale within.\r\n\r\nThe tubes are short, pores minute, rusty-red but covered from the first\r\nwith a white pubescence and continuous with the margin; the spores\r\nnearly round, 6-7µ.\r\n\r\nThe specimens in Figure 350 were found in Haynes' Hollow on a living\r\nash, growing at intervals of five or six feet, one above another, to a\r\nheight of thirty feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trametes. Fr._\r\n\r\nIn case of the genus Trametes the hymenophorum descends into the trama\r\nof the pores without any change, and is permanently concrete with the\r\npileus. The pores are entire. There are, however, a few of the Polypori\r\nwhich are quite thin that have the trama of the same structure with the\r\nhymenophorum. These have been separated by Fries and have been called\r\n_Polystictus_. They are distinguished by the fact that the pores develop\r\nfrom the center out and are perpendicular to the fibrillose stratum\r\nabove the hymenophorum while in the genus _Trametes_ the hymenophorum is\r\nnot distant from the rest of the pileus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trametes rubescens. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 351.--Trametes rubescens.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 352.--Trametes rubescens.]\r\n\r\nThis is one of the neatest plants of this structure in our woods. It\r\ngrows on the small branches and many times covers them quite well. It is\r\nresupinate, the cap being beautifully zoned as you see in Figure 351.\r\nFrequently they grow from the side of a small tree that has fallen to\r\nthe ground and in this case they are shelving.\r\n\r\nThe pore surface is usually reddish or flesh-color, the pores being long\r\nand irregular and inclined to be labyrinthiform in older specimens as\r\nwill be seen in Figure 352.\r\n\r\nThe whole plant is reddish or pale flesh-color. No one will fail to\r\nrecognize it from these cuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trametes scutellata. Schw._\r\n\r\nScutellata means shield-bearing. It is frequently quite small, an inch\r\nor less; coriaceous, dimidiate, orbiculate or ungulate, fixed by the\r\napex; the pilei quite hard: white, then brownish and blackish, becoming\r\nrugged and uneven, with white margin; hymenium disk-shaped, concave,\r\nwhite-pulverulent becoming dark; pores minute, long, with thick obtuse\r\ndissepiments. This is found on fence posts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trametes Ohiensis. Berk._\r\n\r\nThe pilei are pulvinate, narrow, zoned, often laterally confluent;\r\nochraceous-white, tomentose, then smooth, laccate. This plant resembles\r\nT. scutellata in many points, both in habit and in form.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trametes suaveolens. (L.) Fr._\r\n\r\nSoft at first, pulvinate, white, villous, zoneless; pores rotund, rather\r\nlarge, obtuse, white, then darker; anise-scented. Found on willows.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Merulius. Fr._\r\n\r\nMerulius means a blackbird; from the color of the fungus.\r\n\r\nHymenophore covered with the soft waxy hymenium, which is incompletely\r\nporus, or arranged in reticulate, sinuous, dentate folds. This genus\r\ngrows on wood, at first resupinate, expanded; the hymenophore springing\r\nfrom a mucous mycelium.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Merulius rubellus. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 353.--Merulius rubellus. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nRubellus is the diminutive of _ruber_, reddish. The pileus grows in\r\ntufts, sessile, confluent and imbricated, repand, thin, convex, soft,\r\ndimidiate, quite tenacious; tomentose, evenly red, margin mostly\r\nundulately inflexed, growing pale in age. Hymenium whitish or reddish,\r\nfolds much branched, forming anastomosing pores. The spores are\r\nelliptical, hyaline, minute, 4-5×2.5-3µ. The pileus is two to three\r\ninches long and an inch and a half broad.\r\n\r\nIt is found very frequently on decayed beech and sugar trees and I have\r\nfound it growing on a live oak. The specimens in Figure 353 were\r\ncollected near Columbus and photographed by Dr. Kellerman. It is\r\nprobably the same as M. incarnati, Schw.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Merulius tremellosus. Schrad._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 354.--Merulius tremellosus]\r\n\r\nTremellosus, trembling. Resupinate; margin becoming free and more or\r\nless reflexed, usually radiately-toothed, fleshy, tremelloid, tomentose,\r\nwhite; hymenium variously wrinkled and porus, whitish and\r\nsubtranslucent-looking, becoming tinged with brown in the center. The\r\nspores are cylindrical, curved, about 4×1µ. From one to three inches\r\nacross, remaining pale when growing in dark places. The margin is\r\nsometimes tinged with a rose-color, radiating when it is well developed.\r\n_Massee._\r\n\r\nThis plant grows in woods on wood and is quite common in our woods--both\r\nthe rose-colored and the translucent-brown. Captain McIlvaine calls\r\nMerulius tremellosus and M. rubellus emergency species. He says they are\r\nrather tasteless, tough, slightly woody in flavor. They are found in\r\nOctober and November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Merulius corium. Fr._\r\n\r\nResupinate, effused, soft, papery, circumference at length free,\r\nreflexed, white, villous below. Hymenium netted, porus, pallid,\r\ntan-color.\r\n\r\nFound on decaying-branches. Quite common.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Merulius lacrymans. Fr._\r\n\r\nResupinate, fleshy, spongy, moist, tender, at first very light, cottony\r\nand white; when the veins appear they are of a fine yellow, orange or\r\nreddish-brown, forming irregular folds, so arranged to have the\r\nappearance of pores (but never anything like tubes), distilling when\r\nperfect drops of water which give rise to the specific name \"weeping.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Charles W. Hoyt of Chillicothe, brought to my office two or three\r\nplants of this species that had grown on the under side of the floor in\r\nhis wash-house. When he took up the floor the workmen discovered a\r\nnumber of pendant processes, some oval, some cone-shaped. Some were\r\neight inches long, very white and beautiful but clearly illustrating the\r\nweeping process. The doctor called them white rats suspended by their\r\ntails.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dædalea. Pers._\r\n\r\nDædalea is used with reference to the labyrinthiform pores; so named\r\nafter Dædalos, the builder of the labyrinth of Crete.\r\n\r\nThe hymenophore descends into the trama without any change, pores firm,\r\nwhen fully grown sinuous and labyrinthiform, lacerated, and toothed. The\r\nhabits of Dædalea are very much the same as Trametes, but they are\r\ninodorous. Care should be taken not to confound them with the species of\r\nPolyporus that have elongated curved pores.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dædalea ambigua. Berk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 355.--Dædalea ambigua. One-third natural size,\r\nshowing upper surface.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 356.--Dædalea ambigua. One-third natural size,\r\nshowing the pore surface.]\r\n\r\nThe pileus is white, corky, horizontal, explanate, reniform, subsessile,\r\nazonate, finely pubescent, becoming smooth.\r\n\r\nPores from round to linear and labyrinthiform, the dissepiments always\r\nobtuse and never lamellate.\r\n\r\nIt is a very common growth in Ohio, found on old logs of the sugar\r\nmaple. You will see the beginning of the growth in the spring as a round\r\nwhite nodule which develops slowly. If the same plant is observed in\r\nthe summer it will be found to be gibbous or convex in form. It finishes\r\nits growth in the fall when it has become explanate and horizontal,\r\ndepressed above and with a thin margin. When fresh and growing it is of\r\na rich cream-color and has a soft and velvety touch and a pleasant\r\nfragrance. In Figure 355, showing the surface of the cap, the growth of\r\nthe plant shows in the form of the zones. Figure 356 shows the form of\r\nthe dissepiments. In younger specimens these are frequently round, much\r\nlike a Polyporus. There is one locality in Poke Hollow where the maple\r\nlogs are white with this species, appearing, in the distance, to be\r\noyster mushrooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dædalea quercina. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE OAK DÆDALEA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 357.--Dædalea quercina.]\r\n\r\nThe pileus is a pallid wood color, corky, rugulose, uneven, without\r\nzones, becoming smooth; of the same color within as without; the margin\r\nin full-grown specimens thin, but in imperfectly developed specimens\r\nswollen and blunt.\r\n\r\nThe pores are at first round, then broken into contorted or gill-like\r\nlabyrinthiform sinuses, with obtuse edges of the same color as the\r\npileus, sometimes with a slight shade of pink.\r\n\r\nThey grow to be very large, from six to eight inches broad, being found\r\non oak stumps and logs, though not as common in Ohio as D. ambigua. The\r\nspecimen in Figure 357 were found in Massachusetts by Mrs. Blackford and\r\nphotographed here.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dædalea unicolor. Fr._\r\n\r\nVillose-strigose, cinereous with concolorous zones; hymenium with\r\nflexuous, winding, intricate, acute dissepiments, at length torn and\r\ntoothed. The pores are whitish cinereous, sometimes fuscous; variable in\r\nthickness, color, and character of hymenium; sometimes with white\r\nmargin; often imbricated and fuliginous when moist. Widely distributed\r\nover the states and found on nearly all deciduous trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Dædalea confragosa. Boton._\r\n\r\nTHE WILLOW DÆDALEA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 358.--Dædalea confragosa.]\r\n\r\nConfragosa means broken, rough. The pileus is rather convex, corky,\r\nrough, slightly zonate, reddish-brown, unicolorous, somewhat of a\r\nrust-red within.\r\n\r\nThe pores are frequently round, like those of the Polyporus, but\r\nsometimes they are elongated into gills like the Lenzites;\r\nreddish-brown.\r\n\r\nI have seen quite old specimens that were very difficult to distinguish\r\nfrom some of the forms of Lenzites. The young plants resemble very\r\nclosely Trametes rubescens. It grows on Cratægus, willow and sometimes\r\non other trees, and is widely distributed. The specimen in Figure 358\r\nwas found in Massachusetts by Mrs. Blackford, and photographed in my\r\nstudy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Favolus. Fr._\r\n\r\nFavolus is a diminutive of _favus_, honey-comb.\r\n\r\nThe hymenium is alveolate, radiating, formed of the densely irregularly\r\nuniting gills; elongated, diamond-shaped. Spores white. Semicircular in\r\noutline, somewhat stipitate.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Favolus canadensis. Klotsch._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 359.--Favolus Canadensis.]\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, tough, thin, kidney-form, fibrillose, scaly,\r\ntawny, becoming pale and smooth.\r\n\r\nThe pores or alveoli are angular elongated, white at first, then\r\nstraw-color.\r\n\r\nThe stem is eccentric, lateral, very short or lacking altogether.\r\n\r\nThis plant is very common around Chillicothe on fallen branches in the\r\nwoods, especially on hickory. Found from September to frost. Not\r\npoisonous but too tough to eat. I do not believe there is any difference\r\nbetween F. canadensis and Favolus Europeus. I notice that our plant\r\nassumes different colors in different stages of its growth, and the form\r\nof the pores also changes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cyclomyces. Kunz & Fr._\r\n\r\nCyclomyces is from two Greek words, meaning a circle and fungus. This\r\ngenus is very distinct from other tube-bearing genera. The pileus is\r\nfleshy, leathery or membranaceous, and usually cushion-formed. Upon the\r\nlower surface are the plate-like bodies resembling the gills of Agarics\r\nbut which are composed of minute pores. These pore bodies are arranged\r\nin concentric circles around the stem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cyclomyces Greenii. Berk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 360.--Cyclomyces Greenii]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 361.--Cyclomyces Greenii. Old specimens.]\r\n\r\nThe pileus is two to three inches broad, globose at first, convex,\r\nsometimes undulate, somewhat zoned, tomentose, dry, cushion-formed,\r\ncinnamon-brown, rather showy.\r\n\r\nThe gills are in concentric circles around the stem, growing larger and\r\nlarger as they reach the margin of the cap. In the young plant the gills\r\nare divided into long divisions but in the older plant these division\r\nlines disappear as will be seen in Figure 361. The edges of the gills\r\nare white at first, as will be seen in Figure 361, but finally becoming\r\ncinnamon-brown.\r\n\r\nThe stem is central, tapering upward, quite large and swollen at times\r\nvery much like Hydnum spongiosipes; the color is the same as the pileus.\r\n\r\nThis is a very interesting plant and quite rare in Ohio, however, I\r\nfound several plants in the fall of 1905, on Ralston's Run. In the same\r\nlocality I found Boletus badius, and when I first saw C. Greenii I came\r\nnear mistaking it for the same plant and so neglecting it, the caps\r\nbeing at first glance so much alike.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gloeoporus. Mont._\r\n\r\nGloeoporus is from two Greek words, meaning gluten and pore. The\r\nplants of this genus resemble the polyporus and are frequently placed\r\nunder that genus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gloeoporus conchoides. Mont._\r\n\r\nConchoides means like a shell.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is leathery or woody, at first fleshy, soft, effused, with\r\nupper margin reflexed; thin, silky, whitish, with edge of the margin\r\noften reddish. It has a trembling, gelatinous, spore-bearing surface,\r\noften somewhat elastic.\r\n\r\nThe pores are short, very small, round, cinnamon-brown.\r\n\r\nThere are several synonyms. Polyporus dichrous, Fr., and P.\r\nnigropurpurascens, Schw. Montgomery places it in the above genus because\r\nof its gelatinous hymenium.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nHYDNACEAE--FUNGI WITH TEETH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is, perhaps, no family in mycology that has a greater variety in\r\nform, size, and consistency than this. Some species are very large, some\r\nare small, some fleshy, and some are corky or woody. The fruiting\r\nsurface is the special characteristic marking the family. This surface\r\nis covered with spines or teeth which nearly always point to the earth.\r\n\r\nMany of the Hydnaceæ are shelving, growing on trees or logs; some grow\r\non the ground on central, but usually eccentric, stems. The genera of\r\nHydnaceæ are distinguished by the size, shape, and attachment of the\r\nteeth. The following genera are included:\r\n\r\n  Hydnum--Spines discrete at the base.\r\n  Irpex--Resupinate; with gill-like teeth concrete with the pileus.\r\n  Mucronella--Plants with teeth only and no basal membrane.\r\n  Radulum--Hymenium with thick, blunt, irregular spines.\r\n  Sistotrema--Fleshy plants with caps and flattened teeth, on ground.\r\n  Phlebia--Plants spread over the host with crowded folds or wrinkles.\r\n  Grandinia--Covered with granules, more or less smooth, and excavated.\r\n  Odontium--Covered with crested granules.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hydnum. Linn._\r\n\r\nHydnum is from a Greek word meaning an eatable fungus. The genus is\r\ncharacterized by awl-shaped spines which are distant at the base. These\r\nspines are at first papilliform, then elongated and round. They form the\r\nfruiting surface and take the place of the gills in the family\r\nAgaricaceæ and of the pores in the family of Polyporaceæ. The spines are\r\nsimple or in some cases the tips are more or less branched.\r\n\r\nThis is the greatest genus in the family and it includes many important\r\nedible species. It may be divided into two groups: one, those species\r\nhaving a cap and a central or lateral stem; the other, the species\r\ngrowing with or without a distinct cap, in large imbricated masses. Some\r\nimitate coral in structure and some seem to be a mass of spines. Many of\r\nthese plants grow to be very large and massive, frequently weighing over\r\nten pounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hydnum repandum. Linn._\r\n\r\nTHE SPREADING HYDNUM. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 362.--Hydnum repandum. Two-thirds natural size.]\r\n\r\nRepandum, bent backward, referring to the position of the stem and the\r\ncap. The pileus is two to four inches broad, generally irregular, with\r\nthe stem eccentric; fleshy, brittle, convex or nearly plane, compact,\r\nmore or less repand, nearly smooth; color varying from a pale buff--the\r\ntypical hue--to a distinct brick-red; flesh creamy-white, inclining to\r\nturn brown when bruised; taste slightly aromatic, margin often wavy.\r\n\r\nThe spines are beneath the cap, one-quarter to one-third of an inch\r\nlong, irregular, entire, pointed, rather easily detached, leaving small\r\ncavities in the fleshy cap, soft, creamy, becoming darker in older\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, thick, solid in young specimens, hollow in older\r\nspecimens; paler than the pileus, rather rough, often set eccentrically\r\ninto the cap; one to three inches long, sometimes thickened at the base,\r\nsometimes at the top. The spores are globose or a broad oval, with a\r\nsmall papilla at one end.\r\n\r\nThe usual color of the cap is buff, sometimes very pale, almost white.\r\nThe color and smoothness of the cap have given rise to the name of\r\n\"doe-skin mushroom.\" I found this plant occasionally in the woods about\r\nSalem, Ohio. It is very variable in size and color, and is quite\r\nfragile, growing alone or in clusters. It is one of our best mushrooms\r\nif properly cooked, and may be dried and kept for winter use. Found in\r\nwoods and open places from July to October, sometimes earlier. Specimens\r\nin Figure 362 were found in Poke Hollow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hydnum imbricatum. Linn._\r\n\r\nTHE IMBRICATED HYDNUM. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nImbricatum is from _imbrex_, a tile, referring to the surface of the cap\r\nbeing torn into triangular scales, seeming to overlap one another like\r\nshingles on a roof.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, plane, slightly depressed, tessellated scaly,\r\ndowny, not zoned, umber in color or brownish as if scorched, flesh\r\ndingy-white, taste slightly bitter when raw, margin round.\r\n\r\nThe spines are decurrent, entire, numerous, short, ashy-white, generally\r\nequal in length.\r\n\r\nThe stem is firm, short, thick, even, whitish. The spores are pale\r\nyellow-brown, rough.\r\n\r\nThe bitter taste entirely leaves the plant when well cooked. It seems to\r\ndelight in pine or chestnut woods. I found it in Emmanuel Thomas' woods,\r\neast of Salem, Ohio. It is found from September to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hydnum erinaceum. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE HEDGEHOG HYDNUM. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XLVIII. Figure 363.--Hydnum Erinaceum.\r\n\r\nTwo-thirds natural size. The plant is entirely white when fresh.]\r\n\r\nErinaceum, a hedgehog. Two to eight inches or more across. Tufts\r\npendulous. White and yellowish-white becoming yellowish-brown; fleshy,\r\nelastic, tough, sometimes emarginate (broadly attached as if tuft were\r\ncut in two or sliced off where attached), a mass of latticed branches\r\nand fibrils. Spines one and a half inches to four inches long, crowded,\r\nstraight, equal, pendulous. The stem is sometimes rudimentary. The\r\nspores are subglobose, white, plain, 5-6µ. _Peck_, 22 N. Y. Report.\r\n\r\nThe spines when just starting are like small papillæ, as will be seen in\r\nFigure 364. Figure 363 represents a very fine specimen found on the end\r\nof a beech log, on the Huntington Hills, near Chillicothe. It made a\r\nmeal for three families. I have found several basketfuls of this species\r\non this same log, within the past few years. I have also found on the\r\nsame log large specimens of Hydnum corralloides.\r\n\r\nThe photograph at the beginning of the book represents the largest\r\nspecimen I ever saw of this species. It measured eighteen inches one way\r\nand thirteen the other, and was found on a maple tree on top of Mount\r\nLogan. It grew from a central stem, while the one in Figure 363 grew\r\nfrom a crack in a log, apparently without a stem. Plate I, Figure 1 was\r\nphotographed after it was dried. The specimen can be seen in the Lloyd\r\nLibrary in Cincinnati. Found from July to October.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 364.--Hydnum erinaceum. Young state.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hydnum caput-ursi. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE BEAR'S HEAD HYDNUM. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 365.--Hydnum caput-ursi.]\r\n\r\nCaput-ursi means the head of a bear.\r\n\r\nThis is a very beautiful plant but not as common as some other species\r\nof Hydnum. It grows in very large pendulous tufts, as Figure 365 will\r\nindicate. It is found frequently on standing oak and maple trees,\r\nsometimes quite high up in the trees. It is more frequently found on\r\nlogs and stumps, as are its kindred species. The plant arises out of the\r\nwood by a single stout stem which branches into many divisions, all of\r\nwhich are covered by long pendant spines. When it grows on top of a log\r\nor stump the spines are frequently erect. It is white, becoming in age\r\nyellow and brownish. It has a wide distribution through the states. As\r\nan esculent it is fine. The specimen in Figure 365 was found near Akron,\r\nOhio, and was photographed by Mr. G. D. Smith. It is found from July to\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hydnum caput-Medusæ. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE MEDUSA'S HEAD HYDNUM. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 366.--Hydnum caput-Medusæ. One-third natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nCaput-Medusæ, head of Medusa. This is a very striking plant when seen in\r\nthe woods. The tufts are pendulous. The long wavy spines resemble the\r\nwavy locks of Medusa, hence the name. The long soft spines cover the\r\nentire surface of the fungus, which is divided into fleshy branches or\r\ndivisions, each terminating in a crown of shorter drooping teeth.\r\n\r\nThe color at first is white, changing in age to a buff or a dark cream,\r\nwhich distinguishes it from H. caput-ursi. The taste is sweet and\r\naromatic, sometimes slightly pungent. The stem is short and concealed\r\nbeneath the growth.\r\n\r\nI found this plant growing on a hickory log, on Lee's hill, near\r\nChillicothe, from which came the specimen in Figure 366. I have also\r\nfound it on elm and beech. Found from July to October.\r\n\r\nIt is both attractive and palatable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hydnum coralloides. Scop._\r\n\r\nTHE CORAL-LIKE HYDNUM. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 367.--Hydnum coralloides. One-fourth natural size.\r\nEntire plant white.]\r\n\r\nThis species grows in large, beautiful tufts on decaying logs, in damp\r\nwoods. It grows from a common stem, dividing into many branches and then\r\nsub-dividing into many long and coral-like shoots, composed wholly of\r\nattenuated interlacing branches tapering to a point. The spines grow\r\nfrom one side of the flattened branches. It only needs to be seen once\r\nto be recognized as a coral-like mushroom. It is pure white at first,\r\nbecoming creamy or dingy-white with age. It seems to delight in damp,\r\nhilly places, yet I found it to be abundant at Sidney, and to some\r\nextent about Bowling Green, Ohio, where it was very level. It is\r\nplentiful around Chillicothe. One hickory log, from which the specimen\r\nin the figure was taken, furnished me several basketfuls of this plant\r\nduring three seasons, but at the end of the third season the log\r\ncrumbled away, mycelium having literally consumed it. It is one of the\r\nmost beautiful fungi that Dame Nature has been able to fashion. It is\r\nsaid that Elias Fries, when a mere boy, was so impressed with the sight\r\nof this beautiful fungus, which grew abundantly in his native woods in\r\nSweden, that he resolved when he grew up to pursue the study of\r\nMycology, which he did; and became one of the greatest authorities of\r\nthe world in that part of Botany. In fact, he laid the foundation for\r\nthe study of Basidiomycetes, and this beautiful little coral-like fungus\r\nwas his inspiration.\r\n\r\nIt is found principally on beech, maple and hickory in damp woods, from\r\nJuly to frost. I have eaten it for years and esteem it among the best.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hydnum septentrionale. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHERN HYDNUM.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate XLIX. Figure 368.--Hydnum septentrionale.\r\n\r\nGrew from a small opening in a living beech tree.]\r\n\r\nSeptentrionale, northern. This is a very large, fleshy, fibrous plant,\r\ngrowing usually upon logs and stumps.\r\n\r\nThere are many pilei growing one above the other, plane, margin\r\nstraight, whole. The spines are crowded, slender and equal.\r\n\r\nI have found a number of specimens about Chillicothe that would weigh\r\nfrom eight to ten pounds each. The plant is too woody to eat. Besides,\r\nit seems to have but little flavor. I have always found it on beech\r\nlogs, from September to October.\r\n\r\nA very large plant grows every year on a living beech tree on Cemetery\r\nHill.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hydnum spongiosipes. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 369.--Hydnum spongiosipes. One-third natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nSpongiosipes means a sponge-like foot. Pileus convex, soft,\r\nspongy-tomentose, but tough in texture, rusty-brown, the lower stratum\r\nfirmer and more fibrous, but concolorous.\r\n\r\nThe spines are slender, one to two lines long, rusty-brown, becoming\r\ndarker with age.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hard and corky within, externally spongy-tomentose; colored\r\nlike the pileus, the central substance often transversely zoned,\r\nespecially near the top. Spores globose, nodulose, purplish-brown, 4-6\r\nbroad. Pileus one and a half to four inches broad. Stem one and a half\r\nto three inches long, and four to eight lines thick. _Peck_, 50th Rep.\r\n\r\nIt is found in the woods, quite plentifully, about Chillicothe. I\r\nreferred it to H. ferrugineum for a long time, but not being satisfied,\r\nsent some specimens to Dr. Peck, who classified it as H. spongiosipes.\r\nIt is edible but very tough. Found from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hydnum zonatum. Batsch._\r\n\r\nTHE ZONED HYDNUM.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 370.--Hydnum zonatum.]\r\n\r\nZonatum, zoned. Ferruginous; pileus equally coriaceous, thin, expanded,\r\nsubinfundibuliform, zoned, becoming smooth; tough, almost leathery in\r\ntexture, having a surface of beautiful brown, silky lustre, and with\r\nradiating striæ; margin paler; sterile.\r\n\r\nThe stem is slender, nearly equal, floccose, bulbous at the base.\r\n\r\nThe spines are slender, pallid, then of the same color as the pileus,\r\nequal. The spores are rough, globose, pale, 4µ.\r\n\r\nThe spore-bearing spines are shown in the upper plants in Figure 370.\r\nTwo of them show coalesced caps, though the stems are separate. This is\r\nthe case with H. scrobiculatum and H. spongiosipes. The plants in Figure\r\n370 were collected by the roadside in woods on the State Farm, near\r\nLancaster, and photographed by Dr. Kellerman.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hydnum scrobiculatum. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 371.--Hydnum scrobiculatum. Two-thirds\r\nnatural-size.]\r\n\r\nScrobiculatum means marked with a ditch or trench; so called from the\r\nrough condition of the cap. The pileus is from one to three inches\r\nbroad, corky, convex, then plane, sometimes slightly depressed; tough in\r\ntexture, rusty-brown; the surface of the cap usually quite rough, marked\r\nwith ridges or trenches, flesh ferruginous.\r\n\r\nThe spines are short, rusty-brown, becoming dark with age.\r\n\r\nThe stem is firm, one to two inches long, unequal, rusty-brown, often\r\ncovered with a dense tomentum.\r\n\r\nThis species is very plentiful in our woods, among the leaves under\r\nbeech trees. They grow in lines for some distance, the caps so close\r\ntogether that they are very frequently confluent. I found the plant at\r\nSalem, and in several other localities in the state, although I have\r\nnever seen a description of it. Any one will be able to recognize it\r\nfrom Figure 371. It grows in the woods in August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hydnum Blackfordæ. Pk._\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, convex, glabrous, grayish or greenish-gray, flesh\r\nwhitish with reddish stains, slowly becoming darker on exposure; aculei\r\nsubulate, 2-5 mm. long, yellowish-gray, becoming brown with age or\r\ndrying; stem equal or stuffed, becoming hollow in drying; glabrous,\r\ncolored like the pileus; spores brown, globose, verrucose, 8-10µ broad.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is 2.5-6 cm. broad; stem 2.5-4 cm. long, 3-4 mm. thick.\r\n\r\nMossy ground in low springy places in damp mixed woods. August. _Peck._\r\n\r\nThis species was found at Ellis, Mass., and was sent to me through\r\ncourtesy of the collector, Mrs. E. B. Blackford, Boston, for whom it was\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hydnum fennicum. Karst._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 372.--Hydnum fennicum. Natural size, showing the\r\nteeth.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 373.--Hydnum fennicum. Natural size, showing the\r\nscaly cap.]\r\n\r\nPileus fleshy, fragile, unequal; at first scaly, at length breaking up;\r\nreddish-brick color becoming darker; margin undulately lobed, two to\r\nfour inches broad. Flesh white.\r\n\r\nThe teeth decurrent, equal, pointed, from white to dusky, about 4 mm.\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nThe stem is sufficiently stout, unequal below, attenuated, flexuous or\r\ncurved, smooth, of the same color as the cap, base acute, white tomentum\r\noutside, inside light pale-blue, or dark-gray.\r\n\r\nThe spores are ellipso-spheroidical or subspheroidical, rough, dusky,\r\n4-6µ long, 3-5µ broad.\r\n\r\nThe plants in Figures 372 and 373 were found in Haynes' Hollow.\r\n\r\nThe plant is quite bitter and no amount of cooking will make it edible.\r\n\r\nFound in woods from August to September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hydnum adustum. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 374.--Hydnum adustum. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nAdustum means scorched, burned. The pileus is two to three inches broad,\r\nyellowish-white, blackish around the margin, coriaceous, slightly zoned;\r\nplane at first, then slightly depressed; tomentose, thin; frequently a\r\nplant will be found growing on the top of another plant. The spines are\r\nat first white, adnate, short, turning flesh-color and when dried almost\r\nblack.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, solid, tapering upward.\r\n\r\nThe plant is found growing in the woods on trunks and sticks after a\r\nrain in July, August, and September. It is not as plentiful as Hydnum\r\nspongiosipes and H. scrobiculatum. It is an attractive plant when seen\r\nin the woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hydnum ochraceum. P._\r\n\r\nOCHREY HYDNUM.\r\n\r\nSmall, at first entirely resupinate, gradually reflexed, and somewhat\r\nrepand, at first sparingly clothed with dirty-white down, at length\r\nrugose; one to three inches broad. The spines are short, entire,\r\nbecoming pale. _Fries._\r\n\r\nIt is occasionally found on decayed sticks in the woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hydnum pulcherrimum. B. & C._\r\n\r\nMOST BEAUTIFUL HYDNUM.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 375.--Hydnum pulcherrimum. Showing the under side\r\nof one of the pileoli.]\r\n\r\nPulcherrimum is the superlative of _pulcher_, beautiful.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, somewhat fibrous, alutaceus, hirsute; the margin\r\nthin, entire, incurved.\r\n\r\nThe aculei short, crowded, equal.\r\n\r\nIt is found on beech wood, frequently imbricated and laterally\r\nconfluent; a single pileus two to five inches in breadth and projecting\r\ntwo to four inches. The spines are rather short, not exceeding a quarter\r\nof an inch.\r\n\r\nThe entire plant is quite fibrous and has a hirsute surface. The color\r\nvaries from whitish to alutaceous and yellowish. It is not common with\r\nus. Figure 375 represents one of the pilei showing the spines.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hydnum graveolens. Del._\r\n\r\nFRAGRANT HYDNUM.\r\n\r\nGraveolens means sweet-scented.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is coriaceous, thin, soft, not zoned, rugose, dark-brown,\r\nbrown within, margin becoming whitish. The stem is slender and the\r\nspines are decurrent. The spines are short, gray.\r\n\r\nThe whole plant smells of melilot; even after it has been dried and kept\r\nfor years it does not lose this scent.\r\n\r\nI found two specimens in Haynes's Hollow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Irpex. Fr._\r\n\r\nIrpex, a harrow, so called from a fancied resemblance of its teeth to\r\nthe teeth of a harrow. It grows on wood; toothed from the first, the\r\nteeth are connected at the base, firm, somewhat coriaceous, concrete\r\nwith the pileus, arranged in rows or like net-work. Irpex differs from\r\nHydnum in having the spines connected at the base and more blunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Irpex carneus. Fr._\r\n\r\nThis plant, as its specific name indicates, resembles the\r\ncolor of flesh. Reddish, effused, one to three inches long,\r\ncartilaginous-gelatinous, membranaceous, adnate. Teeth obtuse\r\nand awl-shaped, entire, united at the base. _Fries._\r\n\r\nFound on the tulip-tree, hickory, and elm. September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Irpex lacteus. Fr._\r\n\r\nGrowing on wood, membranaceous, clothed with stiff hair, more or less\r\nfurrowed, milk-white, as its specific name indicates.\r\n\r\nThe spines are compressed, radiate, margin porus. Found on hickory and\r\nbeech logs and stumps.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Irpex tulipifera. Schw._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 376.--Irpex tulipifera.]\r\n\r\nCoriaceous-membranaceous, effused; hymenium inferior, at first toothed,\r\nteeth springing from a porus base, somewhat coriaceous, entirely\r\nconcrete with the pileus, netted and connected at the base, white or\r\nwhitish, turning yellowish with age.\r\n\r\nThis plant is very abundant here on fallen tulip trees. I have seen\r\nentire tree tops and trunks covered with this plant. The branches after\r\nthey have been penetrated with the mycelial threads become very light\r\nand brittle.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Phlebia. Fr._\r\n\r\nLignatile, resupinate, hymenium soft and waxy, covered with folds or\r\nwrinkles, edges entire or corrugated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Phlebia radiata. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 377.--Phlebia radiata.]\r\n\r\nSomewhat round, then dilated, confluent, fleshy and membranaceous,\r\nreddish or flesh-red, the circumference peculiarly radiately marked. The\r\nfolds in rows radiating from the center.\r\n\r\nThe spores are cylindric-oblong, curved, 4-5×1-1.5µ.\r\n\r\nThis is quite common on beech bark in the woods. Its bright color and\r\nmode of growth will attract attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grandinia. Fr._\r\n\r\nLignatile, effused, waxy, granulated, granules globular, entire,\r\npermanent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Grandinia granulosa. Fr._\r\n\r\nEffused, rather thin, waxy, somewhat ochraceous, circumference\r\ndeterminate, granules globular, equal, crowded.\r\n\r\nFound on decayed wood. Quite common in our woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHELEPHORACEAE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThelephoraceæ is from two Greek words, a teat and to bear. The hymenium\r\nis even, coriaceous, or waxy, costate, or papillose. There are a number\r\nof genera under this family but I am acquainted with only the genus\r\nCraterellus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Craterellus. Fr._\r\n\r\nCraterellus means a small bowl. Hymenium waxy-membranaceous, distinct\r\nbut adnate to the hymenophore, inferior, continuous, smooth, even or\r\nwrinkled. Spores white. _Fries._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Craterellus cantharellus._ (_Schw._) _Fr._\r\n\r\nYELLOW CRATERELLUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 378.--Craterellus cantharellus. Caps and stems\r\nyellow.]\r\n\r\nCantharellus is a diminutive from a Greek word meaning a sort of\r\ndrinking-cup.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one to three inches broad, convex, often becoming\r\ndepressed and funnel-shaped, glabrous, yellowish, or pinkish. Flesh\r\nwhite, tough, elastic.\r\n\r\nHymenium slightly wrinkled, yellow or faint salmon color.\r\n\r\nThe stem is one to three inches high, tapering downward, smooth, solid,\r\nyellow. The spores are yellowish or salmon color when caught on white\r\npaper, 7.5-10×5-6µ. _Peck._\r\n\r\nThis plant resembles Cantharellus cibarius very closely. The color, form\r\nof growth, and the odor are very similar to the latter. It may be\r\nreadily distinguished from C. cibarius by the absence of folds on the\r\nunder or fruiting surface. The caps are often large and wavy, resembling\r\nyellow cauliflower. It is quite abundant about Chillicothe during the\r\nmonths of July and August. I have frequently gathered bushels of it for\r\nmy mushroom-friends. It will be easily recognized from Figure 378,\r\nbearing in mind that the caps and stems are yellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Craterellus cornucopioides Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE HORN OF PLENTY CRATERELLUS. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 379.--Craterellus cornucopioides. One-third\r\nnatural size.]\r\n\r\nCornucopioides is from _cornu_, a horn, and _copia_, plenty.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is thin, flexible, tubiform, hollow to the base,\r\nblackish-brown, sometimes a little scaly, the hymenium even or somewhat\r\nwrinkled, cinereous.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow, smooth, black, short, almost wanting. The spores are\r\nelliptical, whitish, 11-12×7-8µ.\r\n\r\nNo one will have any trouble in recognizing this species, having once\r\nseen its picture and read its description. Its elongated or\r\ntrumpet-shaped cap, and its dingy-gray or sooty-brown hue, will at once\r\ndistinguish it. The spore-bearing surface is often a little paler than\r\nthe upper surface. The cup is often three to four inches long. I have\r\nfound it in quite large clusters in the woods near Bowling Green, and\r\nLondonderry, though it is found rather sparingly on the hillsides about\r\nChillicothe. It has a wide distribution in other states. It does not\r\nlook inviting, on account of its color, but it proves a favorite\r\nwhenever tested, and may be dried and kept for future use. It is found\r\nfrom July to September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Craterellus dubius. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 380.--Craterellus dubius. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nDubius means uncertain, from its close resemblance to C. cornucopoides.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is one to two inches broad, infundibuliform, subfibrillose,\r\nlurid-brown, pervious to the base, the margin generally wavy, lobed.\r\nHymenium dark cinereous, rugose when moist, the minute crowded irregular\r\nfolds abundantly anastomosing; nearly even when dry. The stem is short.\r\nThe spores are broadly elliptical or subglobose, 6-7.5µ long. _Peck._\r\n\r\nIt differs from C. cornucopioides in manner of growth, paler color, and\r\nsmaller spores.\r\n\r\nIt is distinguished from Craterellus sinuosus by its pervious stem,\r\nwhile very similar in color to Cantharellus cinereus.\r\n\r\nThis plant, like C. cornucopoides, dries readily, and when moistened\r\nexpands and becomes quite as good as when fresh. It needs to be stewed\r\nslowly till tender, when it makes a delightful dish.\r\n\r\nThe plants in Figure 380 were collected near Columbus by R. H. Young and\r\nphotographed by Dr. Kellerman. They are found from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Corticium. Fr._\r\n\r\nEntirely resupinate, hymenium soft and fleshy when moist, collapsing\r\nwhen dry, often cracked.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Corticium lacteum. Fr._\r\n\r\nThis is a very small plant, resupinate, membranaceous, and it is so\r\nnamed because of the milk-white color underneath. The hymenium is waxy\r\nwhen moist, cracked when dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Corticium oakesii. B. & C._\r\n\r\nThe plant is small, waxy-pliant, somewhat coriaceous, cup-shaped, then\r\nexplanate, confluent, marginate, externally white-tomentose.\r\n\r\nThe hymenium is even, contiguous, becoming pallid. Spores elliptical,\r\nappendiculate.\r\n\r\nI found very fine specimens of this plant on the Iron-wood, Ostrya\r\nVirginica, which grows on the high school lawn in Chillicothe. In rainy\r\nweather in October and November the bark would be white with the plant.\r\nIt resembles a small Peziza at first.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Corticium incarnatum. Fr._\r\n\r\nWaxy when moist, becoming rigid when dry, confluent, agglutinate,\r\nradiating. Hymenium red or flesh-color, covered with a delicate\r\nflesh-colored bloom. Some fine specimens were found on dead chestnut\r\ntrees in Poke Hollow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Corticium sambucum. Pk._\r\n\r\nEffused on elder bark, white, continuous when growing, when dry cracked\r\nor flocculose and collapsing. It grows on the bark or the wood of the\r\nelder.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Corticium cinereum. Fr._\r\n\r\nWaxy when moist, rigid when dry, agglutinate, lurid. The hymenium is\r\ncinereous, with a very delicate bloom. Common on sticks in the woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thelephora. Fr._\r\n\r\nThe pileus is without a cuticle, consisting of interwoven fibres.\r\nHymenium ribbed, of a tough, fleshy substance, rather rigid, then\r\ncollapsing and flocculent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thelephora Schweinitzii._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 381.--Thelephora Schweinitzii.]\r\n\r\nSchweinitzii is named in honor of the Rev. David Lewis de Schweinitz.\r\nCæspitose, white or pallid. Pilei soft-corinaceous, much branched; the\r\nbranches flattened, furrowed and somewhat dilated at the apex.\r\n\r\nThe stems are variable in length, often connate or fused together into a\r\nsolid base.\r\n\r\nThe hymenium is even, becoming darker colored when older. _Morgan._\r\n\r\nThis plant is known as T. pallida. It is very abundant on our hillsides\r\nin Ross County, and in fact throughout the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thelephora laciniata. P._\r\n\r\nThe pileus is soft, somewhat coriaceous, incrusting, ferruginous-brown.\r\nThe pilei are imbricated, fibrous, scaly, margin fimbriated, at first\r\ndirty white. The hymenium is inferior and papillose.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thelephora palmata. Fr._\r\n\r\nThe pileus is coriaceous, soft, erect, palmately branched from a common\r\nstalk; pubescent, purplish-brown; branches flat, even, tips fimbriated,\r\nwhitish. The scent is very noticeable soon after it is picked. They grow\r\non the ground in July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thelephora cristata. Fr._\r\n\r\nThe pileus is incrusting, rather tough, pallid, passing into branches,\r\nthe apices compressed, expanded, and beautifully fringed. The plant is\r\nwhitish, grayish, or purplish-brown. It is found on moss or stems of\r\nweeds. I found beautiful specimens at Bainbridge Caves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Thelephora sebacea. Fr._\r\n\r\nThe pileus is effused, fleshy, waxy, becoming hard, incrusting,\r\nvariable, tuberculose or stalactitic, whitish, circumference similar;\r\nhymenium flocculose, pruinose, or evanescent.\r\n\r\nIt is found effused over grass. One meets with it often.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stereum. Fr._\r\n\r\nThe hymenium is coriaceous, even, rather thick, concrete with the\r\nintermediate stratum of the pileus, which has a cuticle even and\r\nveinless, remaining unchanged and smooth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stereum versicolor._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 382.--Stereum versicolor.]\r\n\r\nVersicolor means changing color, referring to the different bands of\r\ncolor. The pileus is effused, reflexed, having a number of different\r\nzones; in some plants the zones are more marked than in others, the\r\nzones appearing very much like those in Polyporus versicolor.\r\n\r\nThe hymenium is even, smooth and brown.\r\n\r\nThis is a very common plant, found everywhere on old logs and stumps. It\r\nis widely diffused and can be found at any time of the year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stereum spadiceum. Fr._\r\n\r\nPilei coriaceous and spreading, reflexed, villous, somewhat ferruginous;\r\nmargin rather obtuse, whitish, even beneath; smooth, brownish, and\r\nbleeding when scratched or bruised.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stereum hirsutum. Fr._\r\n\r\nHirsutum means shaggy, hairy. The pilei are coriaceous and spreading,\r\nquite hairy, imbricated, more or less zoned, quite tough, often having a\r\ngreenish tinge from the presence of a minute algæ; naked, juiceless,\r\nyellowish, unchanged when bruised or scratched. The hymenium is\r\npale-yellow, smooth, margin entire, often lobed. I find it usually on\r\nhickory logs.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stereum fasciatum. Schw._\r\n\r\nFasciatum means bands or fillets. Pileus is coriaceous, plane, villous,\r\nzonate, grayish; hymenium, smooth, pale-red. Growing on decayed trunks.\r\nCommon in all of our woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stereum sericeum. Schw._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 383.--Stereum sericeum.]\r\n\r\nSericeum means silky or satiny; so called from its satin lustre. The\r\nplant is very small and easily overlooked, usually growing in a\r\nresupinate form; sessile, orbiculate, free, papyraceous, with a bright\r\nsatin lustre, shining, smooth, pale-grayish color.\r\n\r\nThe plant grows on both sides of small twigs as is shown in the\r\nphotograph. I do not find it on large trunks but it is quite common on\r\nbranches. No one will fail to recognize it from its specific name.\r\n\r\nWhen I first observed it I named it S. sericeum, not knowing that there\r\nwas a species by that name. I afterwards sent it to Prof. Atkinson and\r\nwas surprised to find that I had correctly named it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stereum rugosum. Fr._\r\n\r\nRugosum means full of wrinkles.\r\n\r\nBroadly effused, sometimes shortly reflexed; coriaceous, at length thick\r\nand rigid; pileus at length smooth, brownish.\r\n\r\nThe hymenium is a pale grayish-yellow, changing slightly to a red when\r\nbruised, pruinose. The spores are cylindrico-elliptical, straight,\r\n11-12×4-5µ. _Massee._\r\n\r\nThis is quite variable in form, and agrees with S. sanguinolentum in\r\nbecoming red when bruised; but it is thicker and more rigid in\r\nsubstance, its pores are straighter and larger.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stereum purpureum. Pers._\r\n\r\nPurpureum means purple, from the color of the plant.\r\n\r\nCoriaceous but pliant, effuso-reflexed, more or less imbricated,\r\ntomentose, zoned, whitish or pallid.\r\n\r\nThe hymenium is naked, smooth, even; in color a pale clear purple,\r\nbecoming dingy ochraceous, with only a tinge of purple, when dry. The\r\nspores are elliptical, 7-8×4µ.\r\n\r\nI found the plant to be very abundant in December and January, in\r\n1906-7, on soft wood corded up at the paper mill in Chillicothe, the\r\nweather being mild and damp.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stereum compactum._\r\n\r\nBroadly effused, coriaceous, often imbricated and often laterally\r\njoined, pileus thin, zoned, finely strigose, the zones grayish-white and\r\ncinnamon-brown.\r\n\r\nThe hymenium is smooth, cream-white.\r\n\r\nThis species is found on decayed limbs and trunks of trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hymenochæte. Lev._\r\n\r\nHymenochæte is from two Greek words, _hymen_, a membrane; _chæte_, a\r\nbristle.\r\n\r\nIn this genus the cap or pileus may be attached to the host by a central\r\nstem, or at one side, but most frequently upon its back. The genus is\r\nknown by the velvety or bristly appearance of the fruiting surface, due\r\nto smooth, projecting, thick-walled cells. I have found several species\r\nbut have only been sure of three.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hymenochæte rubiginosa. (Schr.) Lev._\r\n\r\nRubiginosa means full of rust, so called from the color of the plant.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is rigid, coriaceous, resupinate, effused, reflexed, the\r\nlower margin generally adhering firmly, somewhat fasciated; velvety,\r\nrubiginous or rusty in color, then becoming smooth and bright brown, the\r\nintermediate stratum tawny-ferruginous. The hymenium ferruginous and\r\nvelvety. It is found here upon soft woods such as chestnut stumps and\r\nwillow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hymenochæte Curtisii. Berk._\r\n\r\nCurtisii is named in honor of Mr. Curtis.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is coriaceous, firm, resupinate, effused, reflexed, brown,\r\nslightly sulcate; the hymenium velvety with brown bristles. This is\r\ncommon on partially decayed oak branches in the woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hymenochæte corrugata. Berk._\r\n\r\nCorrugata means bearing wrinkles or folds.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is coriaceous, effused, closely adnate, indeterminate,\r\ncinnamon colored, cracked and corrugated when dry, which gives rise to\r\nits name. The bristles are seen, under the microscope, to be joined.\r\nFound in the woods on partially decayed branches.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nCLAVARIACEAE--CORAL FUNGI.\r\n\r\n\r\nHymenium not distinct from the hymenophore, covering entire outer\r\nsurface, somewhat fleshy, not coriaceous; vertical, simple or branched.\r\n_Fries._\r\n\r\nMost of the species grow on the ground or on well rotted logs. The\r\nfollowing genera are included here:\r\n\r\n  Sparassis--Fleshy, much branched, branches compressed, plate-like.\r\n  Clavaria--Fleshy, simple or branched, typically round.\r\n  Calocera--Gelatinous, then horn-like.\r\n  Typhula--Simple or club-shaped, rigid when dry, usually small.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sparassis. Fr._\r\n\r\nSparassis, to tear in pieces. The species are fleshy, branched with\r\nplate-like branches, composed of two plates, fertile on both sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sparassis Herbstii. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 384.--Sparassis Herbstii.]\r\n\r\nThis is a plant very much branched, forming tufts four to five inches\r\nhigh, and five to six inches broad; whitish, inclining to creamy-yellow;\r\ntough, moist; the branches numerous, thin, flattened, concrescent,\r\ndilated above, spathulate or fan-shaped, often somewhat longitudinally\r\ncurved or wavy; mostly uniformly colored, rarely with a few indistinct,\r\nnearly concolorous, transverse zones near the broad, entire apices.\r\n\r\nThe spores are globose, or broadly elliptical, .0002 to .00025 inch\r\nlong, .00016 to .0002 broad.\r\n\r\nThis species was first found by the late Dr. William Herbst of\r\nTrexlertown, Pa., and was named by Dr. Peck in his honor. The specimen\r\nin Figure 384 was found at Trexlertown, Pa., and photographed by Mr. C.\r\nG. Lloyd. The plant delights in open oak woods, and is found through\r\nAugust and September. It is edible and quite good.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sparassis crispa. Fr._\r\n\r\n_Crispus_, curly. This is a beautiful rosette-like plant, growing quite\r\nlarge at times, very much branched, whitish, oyster-colored, or pale\r\nyellow; branches intricate, flat and leaf-like, having a spore surface\r\non both sides. The entire plant forms a large round mass with its\r\nleaf-like surface variously curled, folded, and lobed, with a crest-like\r\nmargin, and springing from a well-marked root, most of which is buried\r\nin the ground.\r\n\r\nNo one will have any trouble to recognize it, having once seen its\r\nphotograph. I found the plant quite frequently, in the woods about\r\nBowling Green. It is not simply good, but very good.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clavaria. Linn._\r\n\r\nClavaria is from _clavus_, a club. This is by far the largest genus in\r\nthis family, and contains very many edible species, some of which are\r\nexcellent.\r\n\r\nThe entire genus is fleshy, either branched or simple; gradually\r\nthickening toward the top, resembling a club.\r\n\r\nIn collecting clavaria special attention should be given to the\r\ncharacter of the apices of the branches, color of the branches, color of\r\nspores, the taste of the plant, and the character of the place of its\r\ngrowth. This genus is readily recognized, and no one need to hesitate to\r\neat any of the branching forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clavaria flava. Schaeff._\r\n\r\nPALE-YELLOW CLAVARIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 385.--Clavaria flava. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nFlava is from _flavus_, yellow. The plant is rather fragile, white and\r\nyellow, two to five inches high, the mass of branches from two to five\r\ninches wide, the trunk thick, much branched. The branches are round,\r\neven, smooth, crowded, nearly parallel, pointing upward, whitish or\r\nyellowish, with pale yellow tips of tooth-like points. When the plant is\r\nold, the yellow tips are likely to be faded, and the whole plant whitish\r\nin color. The flesh and the spores are white, and the taste is\r\nagreeable.\r\n\r\nI have eaten this species since 1890, and I regard it as very good. It\r\nis found in woods and grassy open places. I have found it as early as\r\nJune and as late as October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clavaria aurea. Pers._\r\n\r\nTHE GOLDEN CLAVARIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nThis plant grows from three to four inches high. Its trunk is thick,\r\nelastic, and its branches are uniformly a deep golden yellow, often\r\nlongitudinally wrinkled. The branches straight, regularly forked and\r\nround.\r\n\r\nThe stem is stout but thinner than in C. flava. The spores are yellowish\r\nand elliptical. It is found in woods during August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clavaria botrytes. Pers._\r\n\r\nTHE RED-TIPPED CLAVARIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 386.--Clavaria botrytes. One-half natural size.]\r\n\r\nBotrytes is from a Greek word meaning a cluster of grapes. This plant\r\ndiffers little from C. flava in size and structure, but it is easily\r\nrecognized from the red tips of its branches. It is whitish, or\r\nyellowish, or pinkish, with its branches red-tipped.\r\n\r\nThe stem is short, thick, fleshy, whitish, unequal. The branches are\r\noften somewhat wrinkled, crowded, repeatedly branched. In older\r\nspecimens the red tips will be somewhat faded. The spores are white and\r\noblong-elliptical. It is found in woods and open places, during wet\r\nweather. I found this plant occasionally near Salem, from July to\r\nOctober, but it is not a common plant in Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clavaria muscoides. Linn._\r\n\r\nFORKED YELLOW CLAVARIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nMuscoides means moss-like. This plant is inclined to be tough, though\r\ngraceful in growth; slender-stemmed, two or three time forked; smooth;\r\nbase downy, bright yellow. The branchlets are thin, crescent-shape,\r\nacute. The spores are white and nearly round. The plant is usually\r\nsolitary, not branching as much as some other species; quite dry, very\r\nsmooth, except at the base, which is downy, in color resembling the yolk\r\nof an egg. It is frequently found in damp pastures, especially those\r\nskirting a wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clavaria amethystina. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE AMETHYSTINE CLAVARIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 387.--Clavaria amethystina.]\r\n\r\nAmethystina means amethyst in color. This is a remarkably attractive\r\nplant and easily recognized by its color. It is sometimes quite small\r\nyet often grows from three to five inches high. The color of the entire\r\nplant is violet; it is very much branched or almost simple; branches\r\nround, even, fragile, smooth, obtuse. The spores are elliptical,\r\npale-ochraceous, sub-transparent, 10-12×6-7µ.\r\n\r\nThis plant is quite common around Chillicothe, and it has a wide\r\ndistribution over the United States. The specimens in Figure 387 were\r\nfound in Poke Hollow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clavaria stricta. Pers._\r\n\r\nTHE STRAIGHT CLAVARIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 388.--Clavaria stricta.]\r\n\r\nStricta is a participle from _stringo_, to draw together. The plant is\r\nvery much branched, pale, dull-yellow, becoming brownish when bruised;\r\nthe stem somewhat thickened; branches very numerous and forked,\r\nstraight, even, densely pressed, tips pointed. The spores are dark\r\ncinnamon. It is found on the Huntington hills near Chillicothe. Look for\r\nit in August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clavaria pyxidata. Pers._\r\n\r\nTHE CUP CLAVARIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 389.--Clavaria pyxidata. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nPyxidata is from _pyxis_, a small box. This plant is quite fragile,\r\nwaxy, light-tan in color, with a thin main stem, whitish, smooth,\r\nvariable in length, branching and rebranching, the branches ending in a\r\ncup. The spores are white.\r\n\r\nIt is found on rotten wood and is readily recognized by the cup-like\r\ntips. The specimen in Figure 389 was found near Columbus and\r\nphotographed by Dr. Kellerman. Found from June to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clavaria abietina. Schum._\r\n\r\nTHE FIR-WOOD CLAVARIA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 390.--Clavaria abietina.]\r\n\r\nAbietina means fir-wood.\r\n\r\nThis plant grows in dense tufts, very much branched, ochraceous, trunk\r\nsomewhat thickened, short, clothed with a white down; branches straight,\r\ncrowded, longitudinally wrinkled when dry, branchlets straight.\r\n\r\nThe spores are oval and ochraceous.\r\n\r\nIt can be readily identified by its changing to green when bruised.\r\n\r\nIt is very common on our wooded hillsides. It is found from August to\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clavaria spinulosa. Pers._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 391.--Clavaria spinulosa.]\r\n\r\nSpinulosa means spiny or full of spines.\r\n\r\nThe trunk of this plant is rather short and thick, at least one-half to\r\none inch thick, whitish. The branches are elongated, crowded, tense and\r\nstraight; attenuated, tapering upward; color somewhat cinnamon-brown\r\nthroughout.\r\n\r\nThe spores are elliptical, yellowish-brown, 11-13×5µ.\r\n\r\nIt is usually given as found under pine trees, but I find it about\r\nChillicothe in mixed woods, in which there are no pine trees at all. It\r\nis found after frequent rains, from August to October. As an edible, it\r\nis fairly good.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clavaria formosa. Pers._\r\n\r\nBEAUTIFUL CLAVARIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 392.--Clavaria formosa. Three-fourths its natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nFormosa is from _formosus_, meaning finely formed.\r\n\r\nThis plant is two to six inches high, trunk rather thick, often over an\r\ninch in thickness; whitish, or yellowish, elastic, the branches\r\nnumerous, crowded, elongated, divided at the ends into yellow\r\nbranchlets, which are thin, straight, obtuse or toothed.\r\n\r\nThe spores are elongated-oval, rough, buff-colored, 16×8µ.\r\n\r\nThis is an extremely beautiful plant, very tender or brittle. When the\r\nplant is quite young, just coming through the ground, the tips of the\r\nbranches are often of a bright red or pink. This bright color soon\r\nfades, leaving the entire plant a light yellow in color.\r\n\r\nThe plant has a wide distribution, and is found on the ground in the\r\nwoods, frequently growing in rows. While the handsomest of the\r\nClavarias, it is not the best, and only the tender parts of the plant\r\nshould be used. It is found from July to October. The specimen in Figure\r\n392 was found in Poke Hollow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clavaria cristata. Pers._\r\n\r\nTHE CRESTED CLAVARIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 393.--Clavaria cristata.]\r\n\r\nCristata is from _cristatus_, crested. This is a smaller plant than the\r\nC. flava or C. botrytes. It is usually two to three inches high, white\r\nor whitish, the tufts of broad flattened branches, sometimes tinged with\r\na dull pink or creamy-yellow. The branches are numerous, widened and\r\nflattened above, deeply cut into several finger-like points, sometimes\r\nso numerous as to give it a crested appearance. This peculiar\r\ncharacteristic distinguishes it from C. coralloides. When the plant is\r\nold the tips usually turn brown.\r\n\r\nSometimes a form will be found in which the crested appearance is\r\nwanting, and in that case the branches terminate in blunt points. The\r\nstem is short and inclined to be spongy.\r\n\r\nIt is found in the woods, in cool, moist, shady places. While it is\r\ntougher than some of the other species, if cut fine and well cooked it\r\nis very good. I have eaten it for years. It is found from June to\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clavaria coronata. Schw._\r\n\r\nTHE CROWNED CLAVARIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 394.--Clavaria coronata.]\r\n\r\nPale yellow, then fawn color; divided immediately from the base and very\r\nmuch branched; the branches divergent and compressed or angulate, the\r\nfinal branchlets truncate-obtuse at apex and there encircled with a\r\ncrown of minute processes. _Morgan_.\r\n\r\nThis plant is found on decayed wood. It is repeatedly branched in twos\r\nand forms clusters sometimes several inches in height. It resembles in\r\nform C. pyxidata, but it is quite a distinct species. In some localities\r\nit is found quite frequently. It is plentiful about Chillicothe. Found\r\nfrom July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clavaria vermicularis. Scop._\r\n\r\nWHITE-TUFTED CLAVARIA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 395.--Clavaria vermicularis.]\r\n\r\nSmall, two to three inches high; cæspitose, fragile, white, club-shaped;\r\nclubs stuffed, simple, cylindrical, subulate.\r\n\r\nFound on lawns, short pastures or in paths in woods. Someone has said\r\nthey \"look like a little bundle of candles.\" Edible, but too small to\r\ngather. June and July.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clavaria crispula. Fr._\r\n\r\nFLEXUOUS CLAVARIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nVery much branched, tan-colored, then ochraceous; trunk slender,\r\nvillous, rooting; branches flexuous, having many divisions, branches of\r\nthe same color, divaricating, fragile.\r\n\r\nThe spores are creamy-yellow, slightly elliptical. This plant is\r\nslightly acrid to the taste and retains a faint trace of acridity even\r\nafter it is cooked. It is very plentiful in our woods. Found from July\r\nto October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clavaria Kunzei. Fr._\r\n\r\nKUNZE'S CLAVARIA.\r\n\r\nRather fragile, very much branched from the slender cæspitose base;\r\nwhite; branches elongated, crowded, repeatedly forked, subfastigiate,\r\neven, equal; axils compressed. Specimens were found on Cemetery Hill\r\nunder beech trees, and identified by Dr. Herbst. The spores are\r\nyellowish.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clavaria cinerea. Bull._\r\n\r\nASH-COLORED CLAVARIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nCinerea, pertaining to ashes. This is a small plant, growing in groups,\r\nfrequently in rows, under beech trees. The color is gray or ashy; it is\r\nquite fragile; stem thick, short, very much branched, with the branches\r\nthickened, somewhat wrinkled, rather obtuse. Its gray color will\r\ndistinguish it from the other Clavaria.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clavaria pistillaris. L._\r\n\r\nINDIAN-CLUB CLAVARIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 396.--Clavaria pistillaris. One-half natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nPistillaris is from _pistillum_, a pestle.\r\n\r\nThey are simple, large, stuffed, fleshy, everywhere smooth, three to ten\r\ninches high, attaining to one inch in thickness; light yellow,\r\nochraceous, brownish, chocolate, club-shaped, ovate-rounded, puckered at\r\nthe top; flesh white, spongy. The spores are white, 10×5µ.\r\n\r\nThey are found in the leaf-mold of mixed woods, and you will sometimes\r\nfind several growing together. They are found from July to frost.\r\n\r\nThe dark variety, which is frequently vertically wrinkled, is slightly\r\nacrid when raw, but this disappears upon cooking. The plant is widely\r\ndistributed but abundant nowhere in our state. I found it occasionally\r\nin the woods near Chillicothe. The plants in Figure 396 were found near\r\nColumbus, and were photographed by Dr. Kellerman of Ohio State\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clavaria fusiformis. Sow._\r\n\r\nSPINDLE-SHAPED CLAVARIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 397.--Clavaria fusiformis. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nFusiformis is from _fusus_, a spindle, and _forma_, a form.\r\n\r\nThe plant is yellow, smooth, rather firm, soon hollow, cæspitose; nearly\r\nerect, rather brittle, attenuated at each end; clubs somewhat\r\nspindle-shaped, simple, toothed, the apex somewhat darker; even,\r\nslightly firm, usually with several united at the base.\r\n\r\nThe spores are pale yellow, globose, 4-5µ.\r\n\r\nThey are found in woods and pastures. The plants in the figure were in\r\nthe woods beside an untraveled road, on Ralston's Run.\r\n\r\nThey strongly resemble C. inæqualis. When found in sufficient quantities\r\nthey are very tender and have an excellent flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clavaria inæqualis. Mull._\r\n\r\nTHE UNEQUAL CLAVARIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nInæqualis means unequal.\r\n\r\nSomewhat tufted, quite fragile, from one to three inches high, often\r\ncompressed, angular, often forked, ventricose; yellow, occasionally\r\nwhitish, sometimes variously cut at the tip. The spores are colorless,\r\nelliptical, 9-10×5µ.\r\n\r\nOne can readily distinguish it from C. fusiformis by the tips, these not\r\nbeing sharp pointed. It is found in clusters in woods and pastures from\r\nAugust to October. As delicious as C. fusiformis.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clavaria mucida. Pers._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 398.--Clavaria mucida.]\r\n\r\nMucida means slimy, so named from the soft and watery condition of the\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nThe plants are quite small, usually simple yet sometimes branched,\r\nclub-shaped, one-eighth to an inch high, white, sometimes yellowish,\r\nfrequently pinkish or rose-tinted.\r\n\r\nThese plants are very small and easily overlooked. It is found on\r\ndecayed wood. I have found it late in the fall and early in the spring.\r\nYou can look for it at any time of the year after warm rains or in damp\r\nplaces, on well decayed wood. The specimens in Figure 398 were\r\nphotographed by Prof. G. D. Smith, Akron, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calocera. Fr._\r\n\r\nThis plant is gelatinous, somewhat cartilaginous when moist, horny when\r\ndry, vertical, simple or branched, cæspitose or solitary.\r\n\r\nThe hymenium is universal; the basidia round and two-lobed, each lobe\r\nbearing a single one-spored sterigma. The spores are inclined to be\r\noblong and curved.\r\n\r\nThis genus resembles Clavaria, but is identified by being somewhat\r\ngelatinous and viscid when moist and rather horn-like when dry, but\r\nespecially by its two-lobed basidia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calocera cornea. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 399.--Calocera cornea.]\r\n\r\nThis is unbranched, cæspitose, rooting, even, viscid, orange-yellow or\r\npale yellow; clubs short, subulate, connate at the base. The spores are\r\nround and oblong, 7-8×5µ.\r\n\r\nFound upon stumps and logs, especially upon oak where the timber is\r\ncracked, the plants springing from the cracks. When dry they are quite\r\nstiff and rigid.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calocera stricta. Fr._\r\n\r\nThese plants are unbranched, solitary, about one inch high, elongated,\r\nbase somewhat blunt, even when dry, yellow.\r\n\r\nIts habitat is very similar to C. cornea but more scattered. C. striata,\r\nFr., is very similar to C. cornea, but is distinguished by its being\r\nsolitary, and striate or rugose when dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Typhula. Fr._\r\n\r\nEpiphytal. Stem filiform, flaccid; clubs cylindrical, perfectly distinct\r\nfrom hymenium, sometimes springing from a sclerotium; hymenium thin and\r\nwaxy.\r\n\r\nThis is distinguished from Clavaria and Pistillaria by having its stem\r\ndistinct from the hymenium. It is a small plant resembling, in\r\nminiature, Typha, hence its generic name.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Typhula erythropus. Fr._\r\n\r\nSimple; club cylindrical, slender, smooth, white; stem nearly straight,\r\ndark red, inclining to be black, springing usually from a blackish and\r\nsomewhat wrinkled sclerotium. The spores are oblong, 5-6×2-2.5µ.\r\n\r\nThis plant has a wide distribution, and is found in damp places upon the\r\nstems of herbaceous plants.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Typhula incarnata. Fr._\r\n\r\nSimple; club cylindrical, elongated, smooth; whitish, more or less\r\ntinged with pink above; one to two-inches high, base minutely strigose,\r\nspringing from a compressed brownish sclerotium. The spores are nearly\r\nround, 5×4µ.\r\n\r\nThis is a common and beautiful little plant and easily distinguished\r\nboth by its color and the size and form of its spores. If the collector\r\nwill watch the dead herbaceous stems in damp places, he will not only\r\nfind the two just described, but another, differing in color, size, and\r\nform of spores, called T. phacorrhiza, Fr. It has a brownish color and\r\nits spores are quite oblong, 8-9×4-5µ.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lachnocladium. Lev._\r\n\r\nLachnocladium is from two Greek words meaning a fleece and a branch.\r\n\r\nPileus coriaceous, tough, repeatedly branched; the branches slender or\r\nfiliform, tomentose. Hymenium amphigenous. Fungi slender and much\r\nbranched, terrestrial, but sometimes growing on wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lachnocladium semivestitum. B. & C._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 400.--Lachnocladium semivestitum.]\r\n\r\nPileus, much branched from a slender stem of variable length, expanded\r\nat the angles; the branches filiform, straight, somewhat fasciculate,\r\nsmooth at the tips and paler in color.\r\n\r\nThis is quite a common specimen on our north hillsides. It is white and\r\nquite fragile. Found in damp places in August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lachnocladium Micheneri. B. & C._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 401.--Lachnocladium Micheneri.]\r\n\r\nCoriaceous, tough, pale or whitish; stem well marked, branching from a\r\npoint, branches numerous, tips pointed; white tomentum at the base of\r\nthe stem.\r\n\r\nThis plant is very abundant here and is found very generally over the\r\nUnited States. It grows on fallen leaves in woods, after a rain, being\r\nfound from July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTREMELLINI FR.\r\n\r\n\r\nTremellini is from _tremo_, to tremble. The whole plant is gelatinous,\r\nwith the exception, occasionally, of the nucleus. The sporophores are\r\nlarge, simple or divided. Spicules elongated into threads. _Berk._\r\n\r\nThe following genera are included:\r\n\r\n  Tremella--Immarginate. Hymenium universal.\r\n  Exidia--Margined. Hymenium superior.\r\n  Hirneola--Cartilaginous, ear-shaped, attached by a point.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tremella. Fr._\r\n\r\nThis plant is so called because the entire plant is gelatinous,\r\ntremulous, and without a definite margin, and also without nipple-like\r\nelevations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tremella lutescens. Fr._\r\n\r\nYELLOWISH TREMELLA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nThis is a small gelatinous cluster, tremulous, convoluted, in wavy\r\nfolds, pallid, then yellowish, with its lobes crowded and entire. Quite\r\ncommon over the state. It is found on decaying limbs and stumps from\r\nJuly to winter. It dries during absence of rain but revives and becomes\r\ntremulous during wet weather. It is called lutescens because of its\r\nyellowish color.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tremella mesenterica. Retz._\r\n\r\nMesenterica is from two Greek words meaning the mesentery. The plant\r\nvaries in size and form, sometimes quite flat and thin but generally\r\nascending and strongly lobed; plicated, and convoluted; gelatinous but\r\nfirm; lobes short, smooth, covered with a frost-like bloom by the white\r\nspores at maturity. The spores are broadly elliptical. Common in the\r\nwoods on decaying sticks and branches.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tremella albida. Hud._\r\n\r\nTHE WHITISH TREMELLA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 402.--Tremella albida. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nAlbida, whitish. This plant is very common in the woods about\r\nChillicothe, and everywhere in the state where beech, sugar-maple, and\r\nhickory prevail.\r\n\r\nIt is whitish, becoming dingy-brown when dry; expanded, tough,\r\nundulated, even, more or less gyrose, pruinose. It breaks the bark and\r\nspreads in irregular and scalloped masses; when moist it has a\r\ngelatinous consistency, a soft and clammy touch, yielding like a mass of\r\ngelatine. Its spores are oblong, obtuse, curved, marked with tear-like\r\nspots, almost transparent, 12-14×4-5µ. The specimen represented in\r\nFigure 402 was found near Sandusky and photographed by Dr. Kellerman.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tremella mycetophila. Pk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 403.--Tremella mycetophila.]\r\n\r\nMycetophila is from two Greek words, _mycetes_, fungi; _phila_, fond of.\r\nThe plant is so called because it is found growing upon other fungi.\r\n\r\nOften nearly round, somewhat depressed, circling in folds, sometimes in\r\nquite large masses about the stems of the plant, as will be seen in\r\nFigure 403, tremelloid-fleshy, slightly pruinose, a dirty white or\r\nyellowish.\r\n\r\nI have found it frequently growing on Collybia drophila, as is the case\r\nin Figure 403. Captain McIlvaine speaks in his book of finding this\r\nplant parasitic on Marasmius oreades in quite a large mass for this\r\nplant. I can verify the statement for I have found it on M. oreades\r\nduring damp weather in August and September. It has a pleasant taste.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tremella fimbriata. Pers._\r\n\r\nFimbriata is from _frimbriæ_, a fringe.\r\n\r\nIt is very soft and gelatinous, olivaceous inclining to black, tufted,\r\ntwo to three inches high, and quite as broad, erect, lobes flaccid,\r\ncorrugated, cut at the margin, which gives rise to the name of species;\r\nspores are nearly pear shaped. Found on dead branches, stumps, and on\r\nfence-rails in damp weather. Easily known by its dark color.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tremellodon. Pers._\r\n\r\nTremellodon means trembling tooth.\r\n\r\nThese plants are gelatinous, with a cap or pileus; the hymenium covered\r\nwith acute gelatinous spines, awl-shaped and equal. The basidia are\r\nnearly round with four rather stout, elongated sterigmata, spores very\r\nnearly round.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tremellodon gelatinosum. Pers._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 405.--Tremellodon gelatinosum.]\r\n\r\nGelatinosum means full of jelly or jelly-like, from _gelatina_, jelly.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is dimidiate, gelatinous, tremelloid, one to three inches\r\nbroad, rather thick, extended behind into a lateral thick, stem-like\r\nbase, pileus covered with a greenish-brown bloom, very minutely\r\ngranular.\r\n\r\nThe hymenium is watery-gray, covered with hydnum-like teeth, stout,\r\nacute, equal, one to two inches long, whitish, soft, inclined to be\r\nglaucous. The spores are nearly round, 7-8µ.\r\n\r\nThese plants are found on pine and fir trunks and on sawdust heaps. They\r\ngrow in groups and are very variable in form and size but easily\r\ndetermined, being the only tremelloid fungus with true spines. The\r\nplants in Figure 405 were photographed by Prof. G. D. Smith of Akron,\r\nOhio. They are edible. Found from September to cold weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Exidia. Fr._\r\n\r\nGelatinous, marginal, fertile above, barren below. Exidia may be known\r\nby its minute nipple-like elevations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Exidia grandulosa. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate L. Figure 404.--Excidia glandulosa.]\r\n\r\nThis plant is called \"Witches' Butter.\" It varies in color, from whitish\r\nto brown and deep cinereous, at length blackish; flattened, undulated,\r\nmuch wrinkled above, slightly plicated below; soft at first and when\r\nmoist, becoming film-like when dry. Found on dead branches of oak.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hirneola. Fr._\r\n\r\nHirneola is the diminutive of _hirnea_, a jug. Gelatinous, cup-shaped,\r\nhorny when dry. Hymenium wrinkled, becoming cartilaginous when\r\nmoistened. The hymenium is in the form of a hard skin which covers the\r\ncup-shaped cavities, and which can be peeled off after soaking in water,\r\nthe interstices are without papillæ and the outer surface is velvety.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hirneola auricula-Judæ. Berk._\r\n\r\nTHE JEW'S EAR HIRNEOLA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 406.--Hirneola auricula-Judæ.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate LI. Figure 407.--Hirneola auricula-judae.]\r\n\r\nAuricula-Judæ, the ear of the Jew. The plant is gelatinous; one to four\r\ninches across; thin, concave, wavy, flexible when moist, hard when dry;\r\nblackish, fuzzy, hairy beneath; when covered with white spores it is\r\ncinereous. The hymenium by its corrugations forms depressions such as\r\nare found in the human ear. One will not fail to recognize it after\r\nseeing it once. It is not common in our woods, yet I have found it on\r\nseveral occasions. It is found on almost any timber but most frequently\r\non the elm and elder. The plant in Figure 406 was found near\r\nChillicothe. Its distribution is general.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Guepinia. Fr._\r\n\r\nGelatinous, inclining to cartilaginous, free, different on the two\r\nsides, variable in form, substipitate. Hymenium confined to one side.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Guepinia spathularia._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 408.--Guepinia spathularia. Entire plant a light yellow.]\r\n\r\nYellow, cartilaginous, especially when dry, spathulate, expanded above,\r\nhymenium slightly ribbed, contracted where it issues from a log.\r\n\r\nIt is quite common on beech and maple logs. I have seen beech logs,\r\nsomewhat decayed, quite yellow with this interesting plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hymenula. Fr._\r\n\r\nEffused, very thin, maculæform, agglutinate, between wavy or gelatinous.\r\n_Berk._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hymenula punctiformis. B. & Br._\r\n\r\nPOINT-LIKE HYMENULA.\r\n\r\nDirty white, quite pallid, gelatinous, punctiform, slightly undulated;\r\nconsisting of erect simple threads; frequently there is a slight tinge\r\nof yellow. The spores are very minute. It looked very much like an\r\nundeveloped Peziza when I found it, in fact I thought it P. vulgaris\r\nuntil I had submitted a specimen to Prof. Atkinson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nASCOMYCETES--SPORE-SAC FUNGI.\r\n\r\n\r\nAscomycetes is from two Greek words: _ascos_, a sack; _mycetes_, a\r\nfungus or mushroom. All the fungi which belong to this class develop\r\ntheir spores in small membranous sacs. These asci are crowded together\r\nside by side, and with them are slender empty asci called paraphyses.\r\nThe spores are inclosed in these sacs, usually eight in a sac. They are\r\ncalled sporidia to separate them from the Basidiomycetes. These sacs\r\narise from a naked or inclosed stratum of fructifying cells, forming a\r\nhymenium or nucleus.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY--HELVELLACEAE.\r\n\r\nHymenium at length more or less exposed, the substance soft. The genera\r\nare distinguished from the earth-tongues by the cup-like forms of the\r\nspore body, but especially by the character of the spore sacs which open\r\nby a small lid, instead of spores. The following are some of the genera:\r\n\r\n  Morchella    Pileus deeply folded and pitted.\r\n  Gyromitra    Pileus covered with rounded and variously contorted folds.\r\n  Helvella     Pileus drooping, irregularly waved and lobed.\r\n\r\n_Morchella. Dill._\r\n\r\nMorchella is from a Greek word meaning a mushroom. This genus is easily\r\nrecognized. It may be known by the deeply pitted, and often elongated,\r\nnaked head, the depressions being usually regular but sometimes\r\nresembling mere furrows with wrinkled interspaces. The cap or head\r\nvaries in form from rounded to ovate or cone shape. They are all marked\r\nby deep pits, covering the entire surface, separated by ridges forming a\r\nnet-work. The spore-sacs are developed in both ridges and depressions.\r\nAll the species when young are of a buff-yellow tinged with brown. The\r\nstems are stout and hollow, white, or whitish in color.\r\n\r\nThe common name is Morel, and they appear during wet weather early in\r\nthe spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Morchella esculenta. Pers._\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON MOREL. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 409.--Morchella esculenta. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nThe Common Morel has a cap a little longer than broad, so that it is\r\nalmost oval in outline. Sometimes it is nearly round but again it is\r\noften slightly narrowed in its upper half, though not pointed or\r\ncone-like. The pits in its surface are more nearly round than in the\r\nother species. In this species the pits are irregularly arranged so that\r\nthey do not form rows, as will be observed in Figure 409.\r\n\r\nIt grows from two to four inches high and is known by most people as the\r\nSponge mushroom. It grows in woods and wood borders, especially beside\r\nwood streams. Old apple and peach orchards are favorite places for\r\nMorels. It makes no difference if the beginner cannot identify the\r\nspecies, as they are all equally good. I have seen collectors have for\r\nsale a bushel basketful, in which half a dozen species were represented.\r\nThey dry very easily and can be kept for winter use. It is said to grow\r\nin great profusion over burnt districts. The German peasants were\r\nreputed to have burned forest tracts to insure an abundant crop. I find\r\nthat more people know the Morels than any other mushroom. They are found\r\nthrough April and May, after warm rains.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Morchella deliciosa. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE DELICIOUS MOREL. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 410.--Morchella deliciosa. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nThis and the preceding species would indicate by their names that they\r\nhave been held in high esteem for a long time, as Profs. Persoon and\r\nFries, who named them, lived more than a hundred years ago. The\r\nDelicious Morel is recognized by the shape of its cap, which is\r\ngenerally cylindrical, sometimes pointed, and slightly curved. The stem\r\nis rather short and, like the stem of all Morels, is hollow from the top\r\nto the bottom.\r\n\r\nIt is found associated with other species of Morels, in woods and wood\r\nborders, also in old apple and peach orchards. They need to be cooked\r\nslowly and long. Coming early in the spring, they are not likely to be\r\ninfested with worms. The flesh is rather fragile and not very watery.\r\nThey are easily dried. Found through April and May.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Morchella esculenta var. conica. Pers._\r\n\r\nTHE CONICAL MOREL. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate LII. Figure 411.--Morchella esculenta var. conica.]\r\n\r\nThe Conical Morel is very closely related to M. esculenta and M.\r\ndeliciosa, from which it differs in having the cap longer than it is\r\nwide, and more pointed, so that it is conical or oblong-conical. The\r\nplant, as a general thing, grows to be larger than the other species.\r\nIt is, however, pretty hard to distinguish these three species. The\r\nConical Morel is quite abundant about Chillicothe. I have found Morels\r\nespecially plentiful about the reservoirs in Mercer County, and in\r\nAuglaize, Allen, Harden, Hancock, Wood and Henry Counties. I have known\r\nlovers of Morels to go on camping tours in the woods about the\r\nreservoirs for the purpose of hunting them, and to bring home large\r\nquantities of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 412.--Morchella esculenta var. conica. Two-thirds\r\nnatural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Morchella angusticeps. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE NARROW-CAP MOREL. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 413.--Morchella angusticeps.]\r\n\r\nAngusticeps is from two Latin words: _angustus_, narrow; _caput_, head.\r\nThis species and M. conica are so nearly alike that it is very difficult\r\nto identify them with any degree of satisfaction. In both species the\r\ncap is considerably longer than broad, but in angusticeps the cap is\r\nslimmer and more pointed. The pits, as a general thing are longer than\r\nin the other species. They are often found in orchards but are also\r\nfrequently found in low woods under black ash trees. I have found some\r\ntypical specimens about the reservoirs. The specimens in Figure 413\r\nwere collected in Michigan, and photographed by Prof. B. O. Longyear.\r\nThey appear very early in the spring, even while we are still having\r\nfrosts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Morchella semilibera. D. C._\r\n\r\nTHE HYBRID MOREL. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 414.--Morchella semilibera. One-half natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nSemilibera means half free, and it is so called because the cap is\r\nbell-shaped and the lower half is free from the stem. The cap is rarely\r\nmore than one inch long, and is usually much shorter than the stem, as\r\nis indicated in Figure 414. The pits on the cap are longer than broad.\r\nThe stem is white or whitish and somewhat mealy or scurvy, hollow, and\r\noften swollen at the base. I found the specimens in Figure 414 about the\r\nlast of May under elm trees, in James Dunlap's woods. They are quite\r\nplentiful there. I do not detect any difference in the flavor of these\r\nand other species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Morchella bispora. Sor._\r\n\r\nTHE TWO-SPORED MOREL. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 415.--Morchella bispora. One-half natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate LIII. Figure 416.--Morchella bispora.\r\n\r\nThe two-spored Morel. Edible. Showing the cap free from the stem quite\r\nto the top.]\r\n\r\nBispora, two-spored, differs from the other species in the fact that the\r\ncap is free from the stem quite to the top. The distinguishing\r\ncharacteristic, which gives name to the species, can be seen only by the\r\naid of a strong microscope. In this species there are only two spores in\r\neach ascus or sac, and these are much larger than in the other species,\r\nwhich have eight spores in a sac or ascus. The ridges, as will be seen\r\nin Figure 415, run from the top to the bottom. The stem is much longer\r\nthan the cap, hollow, and sometimes swollen at the base. The whole plant\r\nis fragile and very tender. The plants in Figure 415 were collected in\r\nMichigan by Prof. Longyear. Those in the full page display were found\r\nnear Columbus and were photographed by Dr. Kellerman. It seems to have a\r\nwide range, but is nowhere very plentiful.\r\n\r\nThe spores can be readily obtained from morels by taking a mature\r\nspecimen and placing it on white paper under a glass for a few hours.\r\n\r\nThe beginner will find much difficulty in identifying the species of\r\nMorels; but if he is collecting them for food he need not give the\r\nmatter any thought, since none need be avoided, and they are so\r\ncharacteristic that no one need be afraid to gather them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Morchella crassipes. Pers._\r\n\r\nTHE GIGANTIC MOREL. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nCrassipes is from _crassus_, thick; _pes_, foot.\r\n\r\nThe cap resembles the cap of M. esculenta in its form and irregular\r\npitting, but it is quite a little larger. The stem is very stout, much\r\nlonger than the pileus, often very much wrinkled and folded. I have\r\nfound only a few specimens of this species. Found in April and May.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Verpa. Swartz._\r\n\r\nVerpa means a rod. Ascospore smooth or slightly wrinkled, free from the\r\nsides of the stem, attached at the tip of the stem, bell-shaped, thin;\r\nhymenium covering the entire surface of the ascospore; asci cylindrical,\r\n8-spored. The spores are elliptical, hyaline; paraphyses septate.\r\n\r\nThe stem is inflated, stuffed, rather long, tapering downward.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Verpa digitaliformis. Pers._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 417.--Verpa digitaliformis.]\r\n\r\nDigitaliformis is from _digitus_, a finger, and _forma_, a form.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is bell-shaped, attached to the tip of the stem, but\r\notherwise free from it; olive-umber in color; smooth, thin, closely\r\npressed to the stem, but always free; the edge sometimes inflexed.\r\n\r\nThe stem is three inches high, tapering downward, furnished at the base\r\nwith reddish radicels; white, with a reddish tinge; apparently smooth,\r\nbut under the glass quite scaly; loosely stuffed. The asci are large,\r\n8-spored, the spores being elliptical. The paraphyses are slender and\r\nseptate.\r\n\r\nFigure 417 represents several plants, natural size. The one in the\r\nrighthand corner is old, with a ragged pileus; the vertical section\r\nshows the pithy contents of the stem. The plants are found in cool,\r\nmoist, and shady ravines from May to August. Edible, but not very good.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gyromitra. Fr._\r\n\r\nGyromitra is from _gyro_, to turn; _mitra_, a hat or bonnet. This genus\r\nis so called because the plants look like a hood that is much wrinkled\r\nor plaited.\r\n\r\nAscophore stipitate; hymenophore subglobose, inflated and more or less\r\nhollow or cavernous, variously gyrose and convolute at the surface,\r\nwhich is everywhere covered with the hymenium; substance fleshy; asci\r\ncylindrical, 8-spored; spores uniseriate, elongated, hyaline or nearly\r\nso, continuous; paraphyses present. _Massee._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gyromitra esculenta. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate LIV. Figure 418.--Gyromitra esculenta.]\r\n\r\nEsculenta means edible. This is the largest spore-sac fungus. The\r\noriginal name was Helvella esculenta. It is bay-red, round, wrinkled or\r\nconvoluted, attached to the stem, irregular, with brain-like\r\nconvolutions.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow when mature, often very much deformed, whitish,\r\nscurvy, frequently enlarged or swollen at the base, sometimes lacunose,\r\nfrequently attenuated upward, at first stuffed; asci cylindrical, apex\r\nobtuse, base attenuated, 8-spored; spores obliquely uniseriate, hyaline,\r\nsmooth, continuous, elliptical, 17-25×9-11µ; paraphases numerous.\r\n\r\nThis plant will be readily recognized from Figure 418, and its bay-red\r\nor chestnut-red cap with its brain-like convolutions. The books speak of\r\nits being found in pine regions, but I have found it frequently in the\r\nwoods near Bowling Green, Sidney, and Chillicothe. Many authors give\r\nthis plant a bad reputation, yet I have eaten it often and when it is\r\nwell prepared it is good. I should advise caution in its use. It is\r\nfound in damp sandy woods during May and June. The plant in Figure 418\r\nwas found near Chillicothe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gyromitra brunnea. Underwood._\r\n\r\nTHE BROWN GYROMITRA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 419.--Gyromitra brunnea.]\r\n\r\nBrunnea is from _brunneus_, brown. A stout, fleshy plant, stipitate,\r\nthree to five inches high, bearing a broad, much contorted, brown\r\nascoma. Stem is ¾ to 1.5 inch thick, more or less enlarged and spongy,\r\nsolid at the base, hollow below, rarely slightly fluted, clear white;\r\nreceptacle two to four inches across in the widest direction, the two\r\ndiameters usually more or less unequal, irregularly lobed and plicate;\r\nin places faintly marked into areas by indistinct anastomosing ridges;\r\nclosely cohering with the stem in the various parts; color a rich\r\nchocolate-brown or somewhat lighter if much covered with the leaves\r\namong which it grows; whitish underneath; asci 8-spored. Spores oval.\r\nThis plant is found quite frequently about Bowling Green. The land is\r\nvery rich there and produced both G. esculenta and G. brunnea in greater\r\nabundance than I have found elsewhere in the state. It is quite tender\r\nand fragile. The specimen in Figure 419 was found near Cincinnati and\r\nphotographed by Mr. C. G. Lloyd.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Helvella elastica. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE PEZIZA-LIKE HELVELLA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 420.--Helvella elastica.]\r\n\r\nElastica means elastic, referring to its stem. The pileus is free from\r\nthe stem, drooping, two to three lobed, center depressed, even, whitish,\r\nbrownish, or sooty, almost smooth underneath, about 2 cm. broad.\r\n\r\nThe stem is two to three and a half inches high, and three to five lines\r\nthick at the inflated base; tapering upward, elastic, smooth, or often\r\nmore or less pitted; colored like the pileus, minutely velvety or\r\nfurfuraceous; at first solid, then hollow. Spores hyaline, continuous,\r\nelliptical, ends obtuse, often 1-guttulate, 18-20×10-11; 1-serrate;\r\nparaphyses septate, clavate. _Massee._\r\n\r\nThe plants in the figure were found near Columbus and photographed by\r\nDr. Kellerman. I have not found the plant as far south as Chillicothe,\r\nthough I found it frequently in the northern part of the state. It grows\r\nin the woods on leaf-mould.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Helvella lacunosa. Afz._\r\n\r\nTHE CINEREOUS HELVELLA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 421.--Helvella lacunosa.]\r\n\r\nLacunosa, full of pits or pitted. This is a beautiful plant, very\r\nclosely related to the Morchellas.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is inflated, lobed, cinereous black, lobes deflected, adnate.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow, white or dusky, exterior ribbed, forming intervening\r\ncavities.\r\n\r\nThe asci are cylindrical, and stemmed. The sporidia are ovate and\r\nhyaline.\r\n\r\nThe deep longitudinal grooves in the stem are characteristic of this\r\nspecies. The plants from which the halftone was made were collected near\r\nSandusky and photographed by Dr. Kellerman. They grow in moist woods. I\r\nfound the plants frequently in the woods near Bowling Green and\r\noccasionally about Chillicothe, growing about well-decayed stumps.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hypomyces. Tul._\r\n\r\nHypomyces means upon a mushroom. It is parasitic on fungi. Mycelium\r\nbyssoid; perithecia small; asci 8-spored.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hypomyces lactifluorum. Schw._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 422.--Hypomyces lactifluorum. The entire plant is a bright\r\nyellow. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nLactifluorum means milk-flowing. It is parasitic on Lactarius, probably\r\npiperatus, as this species surrounded it. It seems to have the power to\r\nchange the color into an orange-red mass, in many cases entirely\r\nobliterating the gills of the host-species, as will be seen in Figure\r\n422.\r\n\r\nThe asci are long and slender. The sporidia are in one row,\r\nspindle-shaped, straight or slightly curved, rough, hyaline, uniseptic,\r\ncuspidate, pointed at the ends, 30-38×6-8µ.\r\n\r\nThis very closely resembles Hypomyces aurantius, but the sporidia are\r\nlarger, rough and warted and the felt-like mycelium at the base is\r\nwanting.\r\n\r\nIt occurs in various colors, orange, red, white, and purple. It is not\r\nplentiful, occurring only occasionally. Capt. McIlvaine says, \"When it\r\nis well cooked in small pieces it is among the best.\" It is found from\r\nJuly to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Leptoglossum luteum. (Pk.) Sac._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 423.--Leptoglossum luteum.]\r\n\r\nLeptoglossum is from two Greek words, meaning thin, delicate, and\r\ntongue; luteum means yellowish.\r\n\r\nThe club is distinct from the stem, smooth, compressed, generally with a\r\ngroove on one side; luteous, often becoming brown at the tip or apex.\r\n\r\nThe stem is equal or slightly enlarged above, stuffed, luteous, minutely\r\nscaly.\r\n\r\nThe spores are oblong, slightly curved, in a double row, 1-1000 to 1-800\r\ninch long. _Peck._\r\n\r\nThese are found quite frequently among moss, or where an old log has\r\nrotted down, on the north hillsides about Chillicothe. The plants were\r\nfirst described by Dr. Peck as \"Geoglossum luteum,\" but afterwards\r\ncalled by Saccardo \"Leptoglossum luteum.\" The plants in Figure 423 were\r\nfound in August or September, on Ralston's Run, near Chillicothe, and\r\nwere photographed by Dr. Kellerman.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spathularia. Pers._\r\n\r\nThis is a very interesting genus, and one that will attract the\r\nattention of any one at first sight. It grows in the form of a spathula,\r\nfrom which it receives its generic name. The spore-body is flattened and\r\ngrows down on both sides of the stem, tapering downward.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spathularia flavida. Pers._\r\n\r\nTHE YELLOW SPATHULARIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 424.--Spathularia flavida.]\r\n\r\nThe spore body is a clear yellow, sometimes tinged with red, shaped like\r\na spathula, the apex blunt, sometimes slightly cleft, the surface wavy,\r\nsomewhat crisp, growing down the stem on opposite sides further than V.\r\nvelutipes.\r\n\r\nThe stem is thick, hollow, white, then tinged with yellow, slightly\r\ncompressed; asci clavate, apex somewhat pointed, 8-spored; spores\r\narranged in parallel fascicles, hyaline, linear-clavate, usually very\r\nslightly bent, 50-60×3.5-4µ; paraphyses filiform, septate, often\r\nbranched, tips not thickened, wavy. While this is a beautiful plant it\r\nis not common. Found in August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Spathularia velutipes. C. & F._\r\n\r\nVELVET-FOOT SPATHULARIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nVelutipes is from _velutum_, velvet; _pes_, foot.\r\n\r\nThe spore body is flattened, shaped like a spathula, spore surface wavy,\r\ngrowing on the opposite sides of the upper part of the stem,\r\ntawny-yellow. The stem is hollow, minutely downy or velvety, dark brown\r\ntinged with yellow. It will dry quite as well as Morchella. It is found\r\nin damp woods on mossy logs. It is not a common plant. Found in August\r\nand September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Leotia. Hill._\r\n\r\nReceptacle pileate. Pileus orbicular, margin involute, free from the\r\nstem, smooth, hymenium covering upper surface.\r\n\r\nThe stem is hollow, central, rather long, continuous with pileus; the\r\nwhole plant greenish-yellow.\r\n\r\nAsci club-shaped, pointed, 8-spored. The spores are elliptical and\r\nhyaline. The paraphyses are present, usually slender and round.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Leotia lubrica. Pers._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 425.--Leotia lubrica.]\r\n\r\nLubrica means slippery; so called because the plants are usually slimy.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is irregularly hemispherical, somewhat wrinkled, inflated,\r\nwavy, margin obtuse, free from the stem, yellowish olive-green,\r\ntremelloid.\r\n\r\nThe stem is one to three inches long, nearly equal, hollow, and\r\ncontinuous with the cap; greenish-yellow, covered with small white\r\ngranules.\r\n\r\nThe asci are cylindrical, slightly pointed at the apex, 8-spored. The\r\nspores are oblong, hyaline, smooth, sometimes slightly curved,\r\n22-25×5µ. The paraphyses are slender, round, hyaline.\r\n\r\nThe plants are gregarious and grow among moss or among leaves in the\r\nwoods. This species is quite plentiful about Chillicothe. It is\r\ndistinguished from Leotia chlorocephala by the color of its stem and\r\ncap. The color of the latter is green or dark green. They are found from\r\nJuly to frost. They are edible but not choice.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Leotia chlorocephala. Schw._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 426.--Leotia chlorocephala.]\r\n\r\nChlorocephala means green head. However, the entire plant is green.\r\n\r\nThey grow in clusters, pileus round, depressed, somewhat translucent,\r\nmore or less waxy, margin incurved, dark-verdigris-green, sometimes\r\nrather dark-green.\r\n\r\nThe stem is rather short, almost equal; green, but often paler than the\r\ncap, covered with fine powdery dust, often twisted.\r\n\r\nAsci cylindric-clavate, apex rather narrowed, 8-spored, spores smooth,\r\nhyaline, ends acute, often slightly curved, 17-20×5µ.\r\n\r\nThe specimens in Figure 426 were found in Purgatory Swamp, near Boston,\r\nby Mrs. Blackford. Both cap and stem were a deep verdigris-green. They\r\nwere sent to me during the warm weather of August.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peziza. Linn._\r\n\r\nPeziza means stalkless mushroom. This is a large genus of discomycetous\r\nfungi in which the hymenium lines the cavity of a fleshy membranous or\r\nwaxy cup. They are attached to the ground, decaying wood, or other\r\nsubstances, by the center, though sometimes they are distinctly stalked.\r\nThey are often beautifully colored and are called fairy cups, blood\r\ncups, and cup fungi. They are all cup-or saucer-shaped; externally\r\nwarted, scurvy or smooth; asci cylindrical, 8-spored. The genus is\r\nlarge. Prof. Peck reports 150 species. Found early in spring till early\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peziza acetabulum. Linn._\r\n\r\nRETICULATED PEZIZA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nAcetabulum, a small cup or vinegar cup. The spore-bearing body\r\nstipitate, cup-shaped, dingy, ribbed externally with branching veins,\r\nwhich run up from the short, pitted and hollow stem; mouth somewhat\r\ncontracted; light umber without and darker within. Found on the ground\r\nin the spring.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peziza badia. Pers._\r\n\r\nLARGE BROWN PEZIZA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 427.--Peziza badia.]\r\n\r\nGregarious in its habits; sessile, or narrowed into a very short stout\r\nstem, more or less pitted; nearly round and closed at first, then\r\nexpanded until cup-shaped; margin at first involute; externally covered\r\nwith a frost-like bloom; disk darker than the external surface, very\r\nchangeable in color; lobes more or less split and wavy, somewhat thick;\r\nspore-sacs cylindrical, apex truncante, sporidia oblong-ovate, epispore\r\nrough, 8-spored. Found on the ground in the grass or by the roadside in\r\nopen woods. I found my first specimens in a clearing at Salem, but I\r\nhave since found it at several points in the state. It should be fresh\r\nwhen eaten.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peziza coccinea. Jacq._\r\n\r\nTHE CARMINE PEZIZA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 428.--Peziza coccinea. One-third natural size.]\r\n\r\nCoccinea means scarlet or crimson. Usually growing two or three on the\r\nsame stick, the color is a very pure and beautiful scarlet, attractive\r\nto children; school children frequently bring me specimens, curious to\r\nknow what they are. Specimens not large, disk clear and pure carmine\r\nwithin, externally white, as is the stem; tomentose, with short,\r\nadpressed down; sporidia oblong, 8-spored. It is readily recognized by\r\nthe pure carmine disk and whitish tomentose exterior. It is found in\r\ndamp woods on decayed sticks, being very common all over the state.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peziza odorata. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE ODOROUS PEZIZA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nGregarious in its habits. Cup yellowish, sessile, translucent, becoming\r\ndull brown when old, brittle when fresh, flesh moist and watery; the\r\nframe of the cup is separable into two layers; the outer one is rough,\r\nwhile the inner one is smooth. The disk is yellowish-brown. The asci are\r\ncylindrical, opening by a lid. On ground in cellars, about barns and\r\noutbuildings. A very beautiful cluster grew upon a water-bucket in my\r\nstable. The cups were quite large, two and a half to three inches\r\nacross. Its odor is distinctive. It is very similar to Peziza Petersii\r\nfrom which it is distinguished by its larger spores and peculiar odor.\r\nFound in May and June.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peziza Stevensoni._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 429.--Peziza Stevensoni.]\r\n\r\nThis plant is sessile or nearly so, growing on the ground in dense\r\nclusters. The specimens in Figure 429 grew in Dr. Chas. Miesse's cellar,\r\nin Chillicothe. They grow quite large at times; are ovate, externally\r\ngrayish-white, covered with a minute down or tomentum, internally\r\nreddish-brown, the rim of the cup finely serrated, as will be seen in\r\nthe figure below. They are found from May to July.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peziza semitosta._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 430.--Peziza semitosta.]\r\n\r\nSemitosta, from its scorched appearance, or umber-like color.\r\n\r\nThe cup is one to one and a half inches across, hemispherical,\r\nhirsute-velvety without, date-brown within; margin indexed.\r\n\r\nThe stem is ribbed or wrinkled. Sporidia are subfusiform, .00117 inch\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nThese plants are found on the ground in damp places. It was formerly\r\ncalled Peziza semitosta or Sarcoscypha semitosta. The plants in Figure\r\n430 were found in August or September on the north side of the Edinger\r\nHill, near Chillicothe, and were photographed by Dr. Kellerman. No doubt\r\nedible, but the writer has not tried them. This is called Macropodia\r\nsemitosta.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peziza aurantia. Fr._\r\n\r\nORANGE-GROUND PEZIZA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nAurantia means orange color.\r\n\r\nSubsessile, irregular, oblique, externally somewhat pruinose, whitish.\r\nThe sporidia are elliptic, rough.\r\n\r\nFound on the ground in damp woods. The cups are often quite large and\r\nvery irregular. Found in August and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peziza repanda. Wahl._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 431.--Peziza repanda.]\r\n\r\nRepanda means bent backward. These plants are found in dark moist woods,\r\ngrowing on old, wet logs, or in well wooded earth. The cups are\r\nclustered or scattered, subsessile, contracted into a short, stout,\r\nstem-like base. When very small they appear like a tiny white knot on\r\nthe surface of the log. This grows, so that soon a hollow sphere with an\r\nopening at the top is produced. The plant now begins to expand and\r\nflatten, producing an irregular, flattened disk with small upturned\r\nedges. The margin often becomes split and wavy, sometimes drooping and\r\nrevolute; disk pale or dark brown, more or less wrinkled toward the\r\ncenter; externally the cup is a scurvy-white. The asci are 8-spored,\r\nquite large. The paraphyses are few, short, separate, clavate, and\r\nbrownish at the tips. The spores are elliptical, thin-walled, hyaline,\r\nnon-nucleate, 14×9µ.\r\n\r\nFound from May to October. Edible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peziza vesiculosa. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE BLADDERY PEZIZA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 432.--Peziza vesiculosa.]\r\n\r\nOften in thick clusters. Those in the center are frequently distorted by\r\nmutual pressure; large, entire, sessile, at first globose; closed at\r\nfirst, then expanding; the margin of the cup more or less incurved,\r\nsometimes slightly notched; disk pallid-brown, externally; surface is\r\ncovered with a coarsely granular or warty substance which plainly shows\r\nin the photograph. The hymenium is generally separable from the\r\nsubstance of the cap. The spores are smooth, transparent, continuous,\r\nelliptical, ends obtuse.\r\n\r\nThey are found on dung-hills, hot-beds or wherever the ground has been\r\nstrongly fertilized and contains the necessary moisture. This is an\r\ninteresting plant and often found in large numbers. Vesicolosa means\r\nfull of bladders, as the picture will suggest.\r\n\r\nI found a very nice cluster on the 25th of April, 1904, in my stable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peziza scutellata. Linn._\r\n\r\nTHE SHIELD-LIKE PEZIZA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 433.--Peziza scutellata. Very small but will show\r\nform under the glass.]\r\n\r\nBecoming plane, vermillion-red, externally paler, hispid towards the\r\nmargin with straight black hairs. Spores ellipsoid. Found on damp rotten\r\nlogs from July to October. Very plentiful and very pretty under the\r\nmagnifying glass.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peziza tuberosa. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE TUBEROUS PEZIZA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 434.--Peziza tuberosa. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nTuberosa, furnished with a tuber or sclerotium. The cup is thin,\r\ninfundibuliform, bright brown, turning pale.\r\n\r\nThe stem is elongated, springing from an irregular black tuber, called\r\nsclerotium. The stems run deep into the earth and are attached to a\r\nsclerotium, which will be seen in the halftone. Many fungus plants have\r\nlearned to store up fungus starch for the new plant.\r\n\r\nThe sporidia are oblong-ellipsoid, simple. It is called by some authors\r\nSclerotinia tuberosa. It grows on the ground in the spring and may be\r\nknown by its bright brown color and its stem running deep into the earth\r\nand attached to a tuber.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peziza hemispherica. Wigg._\r\n\r\nSessile, hemispherical, waxy, externally brownish, clothed with dense,\r\nfasciculate hairs; disk glaucous-white. This is called by Gillet Lachnea\r\nhemispherica. The cups are small, varying much in color and the sporidia\r\nare ellipsoidal. They are found on the ground in September and October.\r\nFound in Poke Hollow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peziza leporina. Batsch._\r\n\r\nSubstipitate, elongated on one side, ear-shaped, subferruginous\r\nexternally, farinose internally; base even. It is sometimes cinereous or\r\nyellowish. Sporidia ellipsoidal. This is called frequently Otidea\r\nleporina, (Batsch.) Fckl. It is found on the ground in the woods during\r\nSeptember and October. Found in Poke Hollow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peziza venosa. P._\r\n\r\nThis plant is saucer-shaped, sometimes many inches broad; sessile,\r\nsomewhat twisted, dark umber, white beneath, wrinkled with rib-like\r\nveins. Odor often strong. Found growing on the ground in leaf mold.\r\nFound in the spring, about the last of April, in James Dunlap's woods,\r\nnear Chillicothe. This is also called Discina venosa, Suec.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peziza floccosa. Schw._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 435.--Peziza floccosa. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nThis is a beautiful plant growing upon partially decayed logs. I have\r\nalways found it upon hickory logs. The cap is cup-shaped, very much like\r\na beaker. The stem is long and slender, rather woolly; the rim of the\r\ncap is fringed with long, strigose hairs. The inner surface of the cup\r\nrepresents the spore-bearing portion.\r\n\r\nThe inside and the rim of the cup are very beautiful, being variegated\r\nwith deep scarlet and white. Also called Sarcoscypha floccosa.\r\n\r\nThe plant is found from June to September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peziza occidentalis._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 436.--Peziza occidentalis. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nThis is another very showy plant, quite equal in attractiveness to P.\r\nfloccosa and P. coccinea.\r\n\r\nThe cup is infundibuliform, the outside as well as the stem whitish, and\r\ndowny, the bowl or disk is reddish-orange. This is known by some authors\r\nas Sarcoscypha occidentalis. It grows on rotten sticks upon the ground.\r\nMay and June.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Peziza nebulosa. Cooke._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 437.--Peziza nebulosa.]\r\n\r\nNebulosa means cloudy or dark, from _nebula_, a cloud; from its color.\r\n\r\nAscophore stipitate, rather fleshy, closed at first, then cup-shaped,\r\nbecoming somewhat plane, the margin slightly incurved, externally pilose\r\nor downy, pale gray or sometimes quite dark.\r\n\r\nAsci are cylindrical; spores spindle-shaped, straight or bow-shaped,\r\nrough, 35-8; paraphyses thread-shaped.\r\n\r\nThese plants are found on decayed stumps or logs in the wood. The woods\r\nwhere I have found them have been rather dense and damp. The plants in\r\nFigure 437 were found in Haynes' Hollow and photographed by Dr.\r\nKellerman.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Urnula craterium. (Schw.) Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 438.--Urnula craterium. Two-thirds natural size.]\r\n\r\nUrnula means burned; craterium means a small crater; hence the\r\ntranslation is a burned-out crater, which will appear to the student as\r\na very appropriate name. It is a very common and conspicuous\r\nAscomycetous, or cup fungus, growing in clusters on rotten sticks that\r\nlie in moist places. When the plants first appear they are small, black\r\nstems with scarcely any evidence of a cup. In a short time the end of\r\nthe stem shows evidence of enlargement, showing lines of separation on\r\nthe top. It soon opens and we have the cup as you see it in Figure 438.\r\nThe hymenium, or spore bearing surface, is the interior wall of the cup.\r\nThe cup is lined inside with a palisade of long cylindrical sacs, each\r\ncontaining eight spores with a small amount of liquid. These sacs are at\r\nright angles to the inner surface, and are provided with lids similar to\r\nthat of a coffee-pot; at maturity the lid is forced open and the spores\r\nare shot out of these sacs, and, by jarring the fungus when it is ready\r\nto make the discharge, they can be seen as a little cloud an inch or two\r\nabove the cup. Place a small slip of glass over the cup and you will see\r\nspores in groups of eight in very small drops of liquid on the glass.\r\nThis species appears in April and May, and is certainly a very\r\ninteresting plant. It is called by some Peziza craterium, Schw.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Helotium. Fr._\r\n\r\nDisc always open, at first punctiform, then dilated, convex or concave,\r\nnaked. Excipulum waxy, free, marginate, externally naked.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Helotium citrinum. Fr._\r\n\r\nLEMON-COLORED HELOTIUM.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 439.--Helotium citrinum. Disc-fungus, yellow\r\ngrowing on rotten logs. Slightly magnified.]\r\n\r\nThis is a beautiful little Disc-fungus, yellow, growing upon rotten logs\r\nin damp woods. They often grow in dense clusters; a beautiful\r\nlemon-yellow, the head being plane or concave, with a short, thick,\r\npaler stem, forming an inverted cone. Asci elongated, narrowly\r\ncylindrical, attenuated at the base into a long, slender, crooked\r\npedicel, 8-spored.\r\n\r\nSporidia oblong, elliptical, with two or three minute nuclei.\r\n\r\nThis is quite a common plant in our woods during wet weather or in damp\r\nplaces, growing upon old logs and stumps, in woods, in the fall. Figure\r\n439 will give an idea of their appearance when in dense clusters. The\r\nplants photographed by Dr. Kellerman.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Helotium lutescens. Fr._\r\n\r\nYELLOWISH HELOTIUM.\r\n\r\nLutescens means yellowish. The plants are small, sessile, or attached by\r\na very short stem; closed at first, then expanding until nearly plane;\r\ndisk yellow, smooth; asci clavate, 8 spored; spores hyaline, smooth.\r\n\r\nGregarious or scattered. Found on half-decayed branches.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Helotium æruginosum. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE GREEN HELOTIUM.\r\n\r\nÆruginosum means verdigris-green. Gregarious or scattered, staining the\r\nwood on which they grow to a deep verdigris-green; ascophore at first\r\nturbinate and closed, then expanding, the margin usually wavy and more\r\nor less irregular; flexible, glabrous, even, somewhat contracted, and\r\nminutely wrinkled when dry; every part a deep verdigris-green, the disc\r\noften becoming paler with a tinge of tan color; 1-4 mm. across;\r\nstem 1-3 mm. long, expanding into the ascophore; hypothecium\r\nand excipulum formed of interlaced, hyaline hyphæ, 3-4µ. thick,\r\nthese becoming stouter and colored green in the cortex; asci narrowly\r\ncylindric-clavate, apex slightly narrowed, 8-spored; spores irregularly\r\n2-seriate, hyaline or with a slight tinge of green, very narrowly\r\ncylindric-fusiform, straight or curved, 10-14×2.5-3.5µ. 2-gutullate,\r\nor with several minute green oil globules; paraphyses slender, with a\r\ntinge of green at the tip. _Massee._\r\n\r\nMassee calls this Chlorosplenium æruginosum, De Not. It is quite common\r\non oak branches, staining to a deep green the wood upon which it grows.\r\nIt is widely distributed, specimens having been sent me from as far east\r\nas Massachusetts. The mycelium-stains in the wood are met more\r\nfrequently than the fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bulgaria. Fr._\r\n\r\nBulgaria--probably first found in that principality.\r\n\r\nReceptacle orbicular, then truncate, glutinous within, at first closed;\r\nhymenium even, persistent, smooth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bulgaria inquinans. Fr._\r\n\r\nTHE BLACKISH BULGARIA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 440.--Bulgaria inquinans. Two-thirds natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nInquinans means befouling or polluting; so called because of the\r\nblackish, gelatinous coating of the cap.\r\n\r\nReceptacle orbicular, closed at first, then opening, forming a cup, as\r\nshown on the right in Figure 440; disk or cup becoming plane; black,\r\nsometimes becoming lacunose; tough, elastic, gelatinous, dark-brown, or\r\nchocolate, almost black, wrinkled, and rough externally; stem very\r\nshort, almost obsolete; cup light umber; sporidia large, elliptical,\r\nbrown.\r\n\r\nThis plant is quite plentiful in some localities near Chillicothe. It is\r\nfound in woods, on oak trunks or limbs partially decayed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nNIDULARIACEAE--BIRD'S NEST FUNGI.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpores produced on sporophores, compacted into one or more globose or\r\ndisciform bodies, contained within a distinct peridium. _Berkeley._\r\n\r\nThere are four genera included in this order.\r\n\r\n  Cyathus--Peridium cup-shaped, composed of three different membranes.\r\n  Crucibulum--Peridium of a uniform spongy membrane.\r\n  Nidularia--Peridium globose, sporangia enveloped in mucus.\r\n  Sphærobolus--Peridium double, sporangia ejected singly.\r\n\r\n_Cyathus. Pers._\r\n\r\nCyathus is from a Greek word meaning a cup.\r\n\r\nThe peridium is composed of three membranes very closely related, closed\r\nat first by a white membrane, but finally bursting at the top. Sporangia\r\nplane, umbilicate, attached to the wall by an elastic cord.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cyathus striatus. Hoffm._\r\n\r\nSTRIATE CYATHUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 441.--Cyathus striatus.]\r\n\r\nThe plants are small, obconic, truncate, broadly open; externally\r\nferruginous, with a hairy tomentum, internally lead-color, smooth,\r\nstriated.\r\n\r\nThe sporangia are somewhat trigonous, whitish, broadly umbilicate;\r\ncovering of the cup thin, evanescent, somewhat thicker underneath, and\r\ncottony, often covered with down-like meal.\r\n\r\nThe spores are thick and oblong.\r\n\r\nThis is a very interesting little plant. It is quite widely distributed.\r\nI have had it from several states, including New England. It is easily\r\nidentified by the striations, or lines, on the inside of the cup, being\r\nthe only species thus marked by internal striæ. The peridioles of the\r\nspecies fill only the lower part of the cup, below the striations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cyathus vernicosus. D. C._\r\n\r\nVARNISHED CYATHUS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 442.--Cyathus vernicosus.]\r\n\r\nVernicosus means varnished. It is bell-shaped, base narrowly subsessile,\r\nbroadly open above, somewhat wavy; externally rusty-brown, silky\r\ntomentose, finally becoming smooth, internally lead-colored.\r\n\r\nThe sporangia are blackish, frequently somewhat pale, even; covering\r\nrather thick, sprinkled with a grayish meal. Spores elliptical,\r\ncolorless, 12-14×10µ. I have frequently seen the ground in gardens and\r\nstubble-fields covered with these beautiful little plants. The quite\r\nfirm, thick, and flaring cup will easily distinguish the species. The\r\neggs or peridioles are black and quite large, appearing white because\r\ncovered with a thin white membrane. Found in late summer and fall. The\r\nplants in Figure 442 were photographed by Prof. G. D. Smith.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cyathus stercoreus._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 443.--Cyathus stercoreus.]\r\n\r\nStercoreus is from _stercus_, dung. This species, as the name suggests,\r\nis found on manure or manured grounds. Mr. Lloyd gives the following\r\ndescription: \"The cups are even inside, and with shaggy hairs outside.\r\nWhen old they become smoother, and are sometimes mistaken for Cyathus\r\nvernicosus. However when once learned, the plants can be readily\r\ndistinguished by the cups. Cyathus stercoreus varies considerably,\r\nhowever, as to shape and size of cups, according to habitat. If growing\r\non a cake of manure, they are shorter and more cylindrical; if in loose\r\nmanured ground, especially in grass, they are more slender and inclined\r\nto a stalk at the base.\" The peridioles or eggs are blacker than other\r\nspecies. They are found in late summer and fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crucibulum. Tul._\r\n\r\nThe peridium consists of a uniform, spongy, fibrous felt, closed by a\r\nflat scale-like covering of the same color.\r\n\r\nThe sporangia are plane, attached by a cord, springing from a small\r\nnipple-like tubercle.\r\n\r\nThis genus is distinguished from Cyathus, its nearest ally, by the\r\nperidial wall, consisting of two layers only.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crucibulum vulgare. Tul._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 444.--Crucibulum vulgare.]\r\n\r\nThe peridium is tan-colored, thick externally nearly even, internally\r\nquite even, smooth, shining; mouths of young plants are covered with a\r\nthin yellowish membrane called the epiphragm. When old the cups bleach\r\nout and lose their yellow color. The peridioles or eggs are white, that\r\nis they are covered with a white membrane. Their yellowish color and\r\nwhite eggs will readily distinguish this species.\r\n\r\nThey are found on decayed weeds, sticks, and pieces of wood. The\r\nspecimens in the halftone grew on an old mat and were photographed by\r\nMr. C. G. Lloyd.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nidularia. Tul._\r\n\r\nThe peridium is uniform, consisting of a single membrane; globose, at\r\nfirst closed, finally ruptured or opening with a circular mouth.\r\n\r\nThe sporangia are quite small and numerous, not attached by a funiculus\r\nto the peridium, enveloped in mucus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Nidularia pisiformis. Tul._\r\n\r\nPEA-SHAPED NIDULARIA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 445.--Nidularia pisiformis.]\r\n\r\nPisiformis is from two Latin words meaning _pea_ and _form_.\r\n\r\nThe plant is gregarious, nearly round, sessile, rootless, hairy, brown\r\nor brownish, splitting irregularly.\r\n\r\nThe sporangia are subrotund or discoidal in form, dark brown, smooth,\r\nshining.\r\n\r\nThe spores are colorless, round or elliptical or pear-shaped, produced\r\non sterigmata, 7-8×8-9µ. Sometimes found on the ground and on leaves,\r\nbut their favorite home is an old log. Found from July to September.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nSUB-CLASS BASIDIOMYCETES.\r\n\r\nGROUP GASTROMYCETES.\r\n\r\n\r\nGastromycetes is from two Greek words: _gaster_, stomach; _mycetes_,\r\nfungus. We have already seen that, in the group, Hymenomycetes, the\r\nspore-bearing surface is exposed as in the common mushroom or in the\r\npore-bearing varieties, but in the Gastromycetes the hymenium is\r\ninclosed in the rind or peridium. The word peridium comes from _peridio_\r\n(I wrap around); because the peridium entirely envelops the\r\nspore-bearing portion, which, in due time, sheds the inclosed spores\r\nthat have been formed inside the basidia and spicules, as will be seen\r\nin Figure 2. The cavity within the peridium consists of two parts: the\r\nthreaded part, called the capillitium, which can be seen in any dried\r\npuffball, and a cellular part, called the gleba, which is the\r\nspore-bearing tissue, composed of minute chambers lined with the\r\nhymenium. The peridium breaks in various ways to permit the spores to\r\nescape. When children pinch a puffball to \"see the smoke,\" as they say,\r\nissue from it, little do they know that they are doing just what the\r\npuffball would have them do, in order that its seeds may be scattered to\r\nthe winds.\r\n\r\nIn case of the Phalloides, the hymenium deliquesces, instead of drying\r\nup.\r\n\r\nBerkeley, in his \"Outlines,\" gives the following characterization of\r\nthis family: \"Hymenium more or less permanently concealed, consisting in\r\nmost cases of closely packed cells, of which the fertile ones bear naked\r\nspores in distinct spicules, exposed only by the rupture or decay of the\r\ninvesting coat or peridium.\"\r\n\r\nThe following families will be treated here:\r\n\r\n  I. Phalloideæ--Terrestrial. Hymenium deliquescent.\r\n  II. Lycoperdaceæ--Cellular at first. Hymenium drying up in a mass of\r\n        threads and spores.\r\n  III. Sclerodermaceæ--Peridium inclosing sporangia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Phalloideæ. Fr._\r\n\r\nVolva universal, the intermediate stratum gelatinous. Hymenium\r\ndeliquescent. _Berkeley's Outlines._\r\n\r\nThe following genera will be represented:\r\n\r\n  I. Phallus--Pileus free around the stem.\r\n  II. Mutinus--Pileus attached to the stem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Phallus duplicatus. Bosc._\r\n\r\nLACED STINKHORN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate LV. Figure 446.--Phallus duplicatus.\r\n\r\nNatural size, showing veil.]\r\n\r\nVolva egg-shaped, thick, whitish, frequently having a pinkish tinge.\r\n\r\nThe stem is cylindrical, cellulose, tapering upward. The veil is\r\nreticulate, frequently surrounding the whole of the stem from the pileus\r\nto the volva, often torn. The pileus is pitted, deliquescent, six to\r\neight inches high, apex acute. Spores elliptic-oblong.\r\n\r\nI am sure I never saw finer lace-work than I have seen on this plant. A\r\nfew years ago one of these plants insisted upon growing near my house,\r\nwhere a fence post had formerly been, with the effect of almost driving\r\nthe family from home. One can hardly imagine so beautiful a plant giving\r\noff such an odor. It is not a common plant in our state.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Phallus Ravenelii. B. & C._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 447.--Phallus Ravenelii. Natural size, showing\r\nvolva at base, receptacle and cap.]\r\n\r\nThis plant is extremely abundant about Chillicothe. I have seen hundreds\r\nof fully developed plants on a few square yards of old sawdust; and one\r\nmight easily think that all the bad smells in the world had been turned\r\nloose at that place. The eggs in the sawdust can be gathered by the\r\nbushel. In Figure 449 is represented a cluster, of these eggs. The\r\nsection of an egg in the center of the cluster shows the outline of the\r\nvolva, the pileus, and the embryo stem. Inside of the volva, in the\r\nmiddle, is the short undeveloped stem; covering the upper part and sides\r\nof the stem is the pileus; the fruit-bearing part, which is divided into\r\nsmall chambers, lies on the outside of the pileus. The spores are borne\r\non club-shaped basidia as shown in Figure 448, within the chamber of the\r\nfruit-bearing part, and when the spores mature, the stem begins to\r\nelongate and force the gleba and pileus through the volva, leaving it at\r\nthe base of the stem, as will be seen in Figure 448. The large egg on\r\nthe left in the background of Figure 449 is nearly ready to break the\r\nvolva. I brought in a large egg one evening and placed it on the mantle.\r\nLater in the evening, the room being warm, while we were reading my wife\r\nnoticed this egg beginning to move and it developed in a few minutes to\r\nthe shape you see in Figure 447. The development was so rapid that the\r\nmotion was very perceptible. The pileus is conical in shape, and after\r\nthe disappearance of the gleba the surface of the pileus is merely\r\ngranular. The plants are four to six inches high. The stem is hollow and\r\ntapers from the middle to each end. This plant is also known as\r\nDictyophora Ravenelii, Burt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 448.--Phallus Ravenelii. Two-thirds natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 449.--Phallus Ravenelii. Two-thirds natural size,\r\nshowing the egg stage.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lysurus borealis. Burt._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 450.--Lysurus borealis.]\r\n\r\nThe receptacle is borne on a stalk, hollow, attenuated toward the base,\r\ndivided above into arms, which do not join at their apices, and which\r\nbear the spore mass in their inner surfaces and sides, inclosing the\r\nspore mass when young, but later diverging.\r\n\r\nThe stem of the phalloid is white, hollow, attenuated downward; the arms\r\nare narrow, lance-shaped, with pale flesh-colored backs, traversed their\r\nentire length by a shallow furrow.\r\n\r\nThe egg in the center is about ready to break the volva and develop to a\r\nfull grown plant. The plants in Figure 450 were found near Akron, Ohio,\r\nand photographed by G. D. Smith.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mutinus. Fr._\r\n\r\nThe gleba is borne directly on the upper portion of the stem, which is\r\nhollow and composed of a single layer of tissue; and the plant has no\r\nseparate pileus, by which characteristic the genus differs from\r\nPhallus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mutinus caninus. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 451.--Mutinus caninus.]\r\n\r\nThe gleba-bearing portion is short, red or flesh-colored, subacute,\r\nwrinkled, the cap or gleba forming the spore-bearing mass which is\r\nusually conical, sometimes oblong or ovoid, covering one-fourth to\r\none-sixth the total length of the stem.\r\n\r\nThe stem is elongated, spindle-shaped, hollow, cylindrical, cellular,\r\nwhite, sometimes rosy. The spores are elliptical, involved in a green\r\nmucus, 6×4µ. The plant comes from an egg, which is about the size of a\r\nquail's egg. You can find them in the ground if you will mark the place\r\nwhere you have seen them growing. They are found in gardens and in old\r\nwoods and thickets. I have found this species in several localities\r\nabout Chillicothe, but always in damp thickets. Mr. Lloyd thought this\r\nmore nearly resembled the European species than any he had seen in this\r\ncountry. Found in July, August, and September.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mutinus elegans. Montagne._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate LVI. Figure 452.--Mutinus elegans.\r\n\r\nNatural size, showing an egg and a section of an egg.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 453.--Mutinus elegans. One-third natural size,\r\nshowing volva, white receptacle and red cap.]\r\n\r\nThe pileus is acuminate, perforated at apex. The stem is cylindrical,\r\ntapering gradually to the apex, whitish or pinkish below, pileus bright\r\nred.\r\n\r\nThe volva is oblong-ovoid, pinkish, segments two or three. The spores\r\nare elliptical-oblong. _Morgan._\r\n\r\nThe odor of this plant is not as strong as in some of the Phalloids. The\r\neggs of Phallus and Mutinus are said to be very good when fried\r\nproperly, but my recollection of the odor of the plant has been too\r\nvivid for me to try them. It is usually found in mixed woods, but\r\nsometimes in richly cultivated fields. I have found them frequently\r\nabout Chillicothe six to seven inches high. In Figure 452 on the right\r\nis shown an egg and above it is a section of an egg containing the\r\nembryonic plant. This plant is called by Prof. Morgan Mutinus bovinus.\r\nAfter seeing this picture the collector will not fail to recognize it.\r\nIt is one of the curious growths in nature. Found in July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nLYCOPERDACEAE--PUFF-BALLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis family includes all fungi which have their spores in closed\r\nchambers until maturity. The chambers are called the gleba and this is\r\nsurrounded by the peridium or rind, which in different puffballs\r\nexhibits various characteristic ways of opening to let the spores\r\nescape. The peridium is composed of two distinct layers, one called the\r\ncortex, the other the peridium proper. The plant is generally sessile,\r\nsometimes more or less stemmed, at maturity filled with a dusty mass of\r\nspores and thread.\r\n\r\nIt affords many of our most delicious fungus food products. The\r\nfollowing genera are considered here:\r\n\r\n    I. Calvatia--The large puffball.\r\n   II. Lycoperdon--The small puffball.\r\n  III. Bovista--The tumbling puffball.\r\n   IV. Geaster--Earth Star.\r\n    V. Scleroderma--The hard puffball.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calvatia. Fr._\r\n\r\nThis genus represents the largest sized puffballs. They have a thick\r\ncord-like mycelium rooting from the base. The peridium is very large,\r\nbreaking away in fragments when ripe and exposing the gleba. The cortex\r\nis thin, adherent, often soft and smooth like kid leather, sometimes\r\ncovered with minute squamules; the inner peridium is thin and fragile,\r\nat maturity cracking into areas. The capillitium is a net-work of fine\r\nthreads through the tissues of spore-bearing portion; tissue, snow white\r\nat first, turning greenish-yellow, then brown; the mass of spores and\r\nthe dense net-work of threads (capillitium) attached to the peridium and\r\nto the subgleba or sterile base which is cellulose; limited and concave\r\nabove. Spores small, round, usually sessile.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calvatia gigantea. Batsch._\r\n\r\nTHE GIANT PUFFBALL. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate LVII. Figure 454.--Calvatia gigantea.]\r\n\r\nThis species grows to an immense size (often twenty inches in diameter);\r\nround or obovoid, with a thick mycelial cord rooting it to the ground,\r\nsessile, cortex white and glossy, sometimes slightly roughened by minute\r\nfloccose warts, becoming yellowish or brown. The inner peridium is\r\nthin and fragile, after maturity breaking up into fragments, apparently\r\nwithout any subgleba; capillitium and spores yellowish-green to\r\ndingy-olive. The spores are round, sometimes minutely warted.\r\n\r\nNot common about Chillicothe, but in the northwestern part of the state\r\nthey are very plentiful in their season, and very large. Standing in Mr.\r\nJoseph's wood-pasture, east of Bowling Green, I have counted fifteen\r\ngiant puffballs whose diameters would average ten inches, and whose\r\ncortex was as white and glossy as a new kid glove. A friend of mine,\r\nliving in Bowling Green, and driving home from Deshler, saw in a\r\nwood-pasture twenty-five of these giant puffballs. Being impressed with\r\nthe sight and having some grain sacks in his wagon he filled them and\r\nbrought them home. He at once telephoned for me to come to his house, as\r\nthe mountain was too big to take to Mohammed. He was surprised to learn\r\nthat he had found that proverbial calf which is all sweet-breads. That\r\nevening we supplied twenty-five families with slices of these puffballs.\r\n\r\nThey can be kept for two or three days on ice. The photograph, taken by\r\nProf. Shaffner of Ohio State University, will show how they look growing\r\nin the grass. They seem to delight to nestle in the tall bluegrass. This\r\nspecies has been classed heretofore as Lycoperdon giganteum. Found from\r\nAugust to October.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 455.--Calvatia gigantia. One-fifth natural size,\r\nshowing how they grow in the grass.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calvatia lilacina. Berk._\r\n\r\nLILAC PUFFBALL. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate LVIII. Figure 456.--Calvatia lilacina.\r\n\r\nNatural size in a growing state.]\r\n\r\nThe peridium is three to six inches in diameter; globose or depressed\r\nglobose; smooth or minutely floccose or scaly; whitish, cinereous-brown\r\nor pinkish-brown, often cracking into areas in the upper part; commonly\r\nwith a short, thick, stemless base; capillitium and spores purple-brown,\r\nthese and the upper part of the peridium falling away and disappearing\r\nwhen old, leaving a cup-shaped base with a ragged margin. Spores\r\nglobose, rough, purple-brown, 5-6.5 broad. _Peck_, 48th Rep. N. Y.\r\nState Bot.\r\n\r\nIt is very common all over the state. I have seen pastures in Shelby and\r\nDefiance counties dotted all over with this species. When the inside is\r\nwhite, they are very good and meaty. No puffball is poisonous, so far as\r\nis known, but if the inside has turned yellowish at all it is apt to be\r\nquite bitter. It will often be seen in pastures and open woods in the\r\nform of a cup, the upper portion having broken away and the wind having\r\nscooped out the purple spore-mass, leaving only the cup-shaped base. The\r\nspecimens in Figure 457 are just beginning to crack open and to show\r\npurplish stains. They represent less than one-fourth of the natural\r\nsize. They look very much like the smaller sized C. gigantea, but the\r\npurple spores and the subgleba at once distinguish the species. This\r\nspecies, found from July to October, is sometimes classed as Lycoperdon\r\ncyathiforme. The photograph was taken by Prof. Longyear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 457.--Calvatia lilacina.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calvatia cælata. Bull._\r\n\r\nTHE CARVED PUFFBALL. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate LIX. Figure 458.--Calvatia caelata.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 459.--Calvatia cælata.]\r\n\r\nCælata, carved. Peridium large, obovoid or top-shaped, depressed above,\r\nwith a stout thick base and a cord-like root. Cortex a thickish floccose\r\nlayer, with coarse warts or spines above, whitish then ochraceous or\r\nfinally brown, at length breaking up into areola which are more or less\r\npersistent; inner peridium thick but fragile, thinner about the apex,\r\nwhere it finally ruptures, forming a large, irregular, torn opening.\r\nSubgleba occupying nearly half the peridium, cup-shaped above and for a\r\nlong time persistent; the mass of spores and capillitium compact,\r\nfarinaceous greenish-yellow or olivaceous, becoming pale to dark-brown;\r\nthe threads are very much branched, the primary branches two or three\r\ntimes as thick as the spores, very brittle, soon breaking up into\r\nfragments. Spores globose, even, 4-4.5 in diameter, sessile or\r\nsometimes with a short or minute pedicel. Peridium is three to five\r\ninches in diameter. _Morgan._\r\n\r\nThis species is much like the preceding but can be easily distinguished\r\nby the larger size and the yellowish-olive color of the mature\r\nspore-mass. The sterile base is often the larger part of the fungus and,\r\nas will be seen in Figure 459, it is anchored by a heavy root-like\r\ngrowth. It is found growing on the ground in fields and thin woods. When\r\nwhite through and through, sliced, rolled in egg and cracker crumbs, and\r\nnicely fried, you are glad you know a puffball. Found from August to\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calvatia craniiformis. Schw._\r\n\r\nTHE BRAIN-SHAPED CALVATIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate LX. Figure 460.--Calvatia craniiformis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 461.--The sterile part of C. craniiformis.]\r\n\r\nCraniiformis is from _Cranion_, a skull; _forma_, a form.\r\n\r\nThe peridium is very large, obovoid or top-shaped, depressed above, the\r\nbase thick and stout, with a cord-like root. The cortex is a smooth\r\ncontinuous layer, very thin and fragile, easily peeling off, pallid or\r\ngrayish, sometimes with a reddish tinge, often becoming folded in areas;\r\nthe inner peridium is thin, ochraceous to bright-brown, extremely\r\nfragile, the upper part, after maturity, breaking into fragments and\r\nfalling away.\r\n\r\nThe subgleba occupies about one-half of the peridium, is cup-shaped\r\nabove and for a long time persistent; the mass of spores and capillitium\r\nis greenish-yellow, then ochraceous or dirty olivaceous; the threads are\r\nvery long, about as thick as the spores, branched. The spores are\r\nglobose, even, 3-3.5µ in diameter, with minute pedicels. _Morgan._\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to distinguish this from C. lilacina when fresh, but\r\nwhen ripe the color will tell the species. Figure 460 shows the plant as\r\nit appears on the ground, and figure 461 shows the subgleba or sterile\r\nbase, which is frequently found on the ground after weathering the\r\nwinter. This plant is very common on the hillsides under small oak\r\nshrubbery. I have gathered a basketful within a few feet. They grow very\r\nlarge, often five to six inches in diameter, seeming to delight in\r\nrather poor soil. When the spore-mass is white this is an excellent\r\nfungus, but exceedingly bitter after it has turned yellow. Found during\r\nOctober and November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Calvatia elata. Massee._\r\n\r\nTHE STEMMED CALVATIA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 462.--Calvatia elata.]\r\n\r\nElata means tall; so called from its long stem.\r\n\r\nThe peridium is round, often slightly depressed above, plicate below,\r\nwhere it is abruptly contracted into a long stem-like base. The base is\r\nslender, round, and frequently pitted; mycelium rather plentiful,\r\nfibrous and thread-like. When in good condition it is a rich cream\r\ncolor. The cortex consists of a coat of minute persistent granules or\r\nspinules. The inner peridium is white or cream-colored, becoming brown\r\nor olivaceous, quite thin and fragile, the upper part at maturity\r\nbreaking up and falling away. The subgleba occupies the stem. The mass\r\nof spores and capillitium is usually brown or greenish-brown. The\r\nthreads are very long, branched, branches slender. Spores round, even,\r\nsometimes slightly warted, 4-5µ, with a slight pedicel.\r\n\r\nThe plant grows on low mossy grounds among bushes, especially where it\r\nis inclined to be swampy. The plant in Figure 462 was found in a\r\nsphagnum swamp near Akron and was photographed by Prof. G. D. Smith. I\r\nam inclined to think it the same as Calvatia saccata, Fr.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lycoperdon. Tourn._\r\n\r\nMycelium fibrous, rooting from the base. Peridium small, globose,\r\nobovoid or turbinate, with a more or less thickened base; cortex a\r\nsubpersistent coat of soft spines, scales, warts or granules; inner\r\nperidium thin, membranaceous, becoming papyraceous, dehiscent by a\r\nregular apical mouth. _Morgan._\r\n\r\nThis genus includes puffballs with apical openings and is divided into\r\ntwo series, a purple-spored and an olive-spored series. The microscope\r\nshows that the gleba is composed of a great number of spores mixed with\r\nsimple or branched threads. There are two sets of threads; one set\r\narises from the peridial wall and the other from the subgleba or\r\ncolumella.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURPLE-SPORED SERIES.\r\n\r\n_Lycoperdon pulcherrimum. B. & C._\r\n\r\nTHE MOST BEAUTIFUL PUFFBALL. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Specimen from A. P. Morgan._\r\n\r\n_Photo by C. G. Lloyd_\r\n\r\nFigure 463.--Lycoperdon pulcherrimum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 464.--Lycoperdon pulcherrimum.]\r\n\r\nPulcherrimum, most beautiful. The peridium is obovoid, with a short\r\nbase, the mycelium forming a cord like a root. The cortex is covered\r\nwith long white spines, converging at the apex, as will be seen in\r\nFigure 463. The spines soon fall from the upper part of the peridium,\r\nleaving the inner peridium with a smooth purplish-brown surface, often\r\nslightly scarred by the base of the spine. The subgleba occupies at\r\nleast a third of the peridium. The spores and the capillitium are at\r\nfirst olivaceous, then brownish-purple, the spores rough and minutely\r\nwarted. The plant is one to two inches in diameter. It is found in low,\r\nrich ground, in fields and wood margins. Only young and fresh plants are\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nThe lower plant in Figure 463 shows where the spines have begun to fall,\r\nalso the strong mycelial cord referred to in the description. I am\r\nindebted to Mr. Lloyd for the photograph. Found in September and\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lycoperdon umbrinum. Pers._\r\n\r\nTHE SMOOTH PUFFBALL. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nUmbrinum, dingy umber. Peridium obovate, nearly sub-turbinate, with a\r\nsoft, delicate, velvety bark; yellowish; inner peridium smooth and\r\nglossy, opening by a small aperture. The spores and capillitium,\r\nolivaceous, then purplish-brown. The capillitium with a central\r\ncolumella. A very attractive little plant, not frequently found. This\r\nplant is also called L. glabellum. In woods, September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLIVE-SPORED SERIES.\r\n\r\n_Lycoperdon gemmatum. Batsch._\r\n\r\nTHE GEMMED PUFFBALL. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate LXI. Figure 465.--Lycoperdon gemmatum.\r\n\r\nNatural size. Entirely white when young. From the young to the matured\r\ndehiscing plant.]\r\n\r\nThe peridium is turbinate, depressed above; the base short and obconic,\r\nor more elongated and tapering, or subcylindric, arising from a fibrous\r\nmycelium. The cortex consists of long, thick, erect spines or warts of\r\nirregular shape, with intervening smaller ones, whitish or gray in\r\ncolor, sometimes with a tinge of red or brown; the larger spines first\r\nfall away, leaving pale spots on the surface, and giving it a reticulate\r\nappearance. The subgleba is variable in amount, usually more than half\r\nthe peridium; mass of spores and capillitium greenish-yellow, then\r\npale-brown; threads simple or scarcely branched, about as thick as the\r\nspores. Spores globose, even, or very minutely warted. _Morgan._\r\n\r\nThe species is readily recognized by the large erect spines which,\r\nbecause of their peculiar form and color, have given the notion of gems,\r\nwhence the name of the species. These and the reticulations can be seen\r\nin Figure 465 by the aid of a glass. They are frequently found about\r\nChillicothe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lycoperdon subincarnatum. Pk._\r\n\r\nTHE PINKISH PUFFBALL. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 466.--Lycoperdon subincarnatum.]\r\n\r\nSubincarnatum means pale flesh-color. The peridium is globe-shaped,\r\nsessile, without a stem-like base. Not large, rarely over one inch in\r\ndiameter. The subgleba is present but small. The outer peridium is\r\npinkish-brown, with minute short, stout spinules, which fall away at\r\nmaturity, leaving the inner ash-colored peridium neatly pitted by the\r\nfalling off of the spinules of the outer coat, the pits not being\r\nsurrounded by dotted lines. The capillitium and spores are first\r\ngreenish-yellow, then brownish-olive. The threads are long, simple, and\r\ntransparent. The columella is present and the spores are round and\r\nminutely warted.\r\n\r\nThey are often found in abundance on decayed logs, old stumps, and on\r\nthe ground about stumps where the ground is especially full of decayed\r\nwood. They are found from August to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lycoperdon cruciatum. Roth._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 467.--Lycoperdon cruciatum.]\r\n\r\nPeridium broadly ovate, often much depressed, plicate underneath, with a\r\ncord-like root; cortex a dense white coat of convergent spines, which at\r\nmaturity peel off in flakes, as can be seen in the photograph, revealing\r\na thin furfuraceous layer of minute yellowish scales covering the inner\r\nperidium. The subgleba broad, occupying about one-third of the cavity.\r\nThe spores and capillitium are dark-brown. This species is very hard to\r\ndistinguish from Wrightii. It was once called _separans_ because of the\r\nfact that the outer coat separates, or peels off, so readily from the\r\ninner peridium. Found in open woods, or along paths in open woods or\r\npastures.\r\n\r\nFrom July to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lycoperdon Wrightii. B. & C._\r\n\r\nEDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 468.--Lycoperdon Wrightii. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe specific name is in honor of Charles Wright. The peridium is\r\nglobe-like, sessile, white, minutely spinulose, often converging at the\r\napex; when denuded, smooth or minutely velvety.\r\n\r\nThe spores and capillitium greenish-yellow, then brown-olive; the\r\ncolumella present, but very small. Spores small, smooth, 3-4µ.\r\n\r\nThe plants are very small, scarcely more than two cm. in diameter. They\r\nare generally cæspitose in short grass, along paths, and in sandy\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nI have frequently seen the ground white with them on Cemetery Hill where\r\nthe specimens in Figure 468 were found. They were photographed by Dr.\r\nKellerman. Found from July to the last of October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lycoperdon pyriforme. Schaeff._\r\n\r\nTHE PEAR-SHAPED PUFFBALL. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate LXII. Figure 469.--Lycoperdon pyriforme.\r\n\r\nNatural size when young as seen growing on decayed wood. The sections\r\nshow they are in the edible state.]\r\n\r\nPyriforme means pear-shaped. The peridium is ovate or pear-shaped, with\r\na profusion of mycelial threads, as will be seen in Figure 470.\r\n\r\nThe cortex is covered with a thin coat of minute brownish scales or\r\ngranules, which are quite persistent. These can be seen in the\r\nphotograph by the aid of a glass. They are sessile or have a short\r\nstem-like base; the subgleba is small and compact; the capillitium and\r\nspores are first white, then greenish-yellow, then dingy olivaceous; the\r\ninner coat is smooth, papery, whitish-gray or brownish, opening by an\r\napical mouth; the spores are round, even, greenish-yellow to\r\nbrownish-olive.\r\n\r\nThey grow in dense clusters, as will be seen in Figure 470. An entire\r\nlog and stump, about four feet high, and the roots around it, were\r\ncovered, as shown in Plate LXII. I gathered about three pecks, at this\r\none place, to divide with my friends. It is one of the most common\r\npuffballs, and you may usually be sure of getting some, if you go into\r\nthe woods where there are decayed logs and stumps. A friend of mine, who\r\ngoes hunting with me occasionally, eats them as one would eat cherries.\r\n\r\nFound from July to November.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 470.--Lycoperdon pyriforme. Natural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lycoperdon pusillum. Pr._\r\n\r\nTHE SMALL LYCOPERDON. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nPusillum means small.\r\n\r\nPeridium is one-fourth to one inch broad, globose, scattered or\r\ncespitose, sessile, radicating, with but little cellular tissue at the\r\nbase, white, or whitish, brownish when old, rimose-squamulose or\r\nslightly roughened with minute floccose or furfuraceous persistent\r\nwarts; capillitium and spores greenish-yellow, then dingy olivaceous.\r\nSpores smooth 4µ in diameter. _Peck._\r\n\r\nThese are found from June to cool weather in the fall, in pastures where\r\nthe grass is eaten short. When mature they dehisce by a small opening,\r\nand when broken open will disclose the olive or greenish-yellow\r\ncapillitium. The spores are of the same color, smooth and round.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lycoperdon acuminatum. Bosc._\r\n\r\nTHE POINTED LYCOPERDON. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\nAcuminatum means pointed.\r\n\r\nThe peridium is small, round, then egg-shaped; with a plentiful mass of\r\nmycelium in the moss in which the plants seem to delight. The plant is\r\nwhite and the outer rind is soft and delicate. There is no subgleba; the\r\nspores and capillitium are pale-greenish-yellow, then a dirty gray. The\r\nthreads are simple, transparent, much thicker than the spores. The\r\nspores are round, smooth, 3µ in diameter.\r\n\r\nI have found the plants frequently about Chillicothe on damp,\r\nmoss-covered logs and sometimes at the base of beech trees, when covered\r\nwith moss. They are very small, not exceeding one-half inch in diameter.\r\nThe small ovoid form, with the white, soft, delicate cortex, will serve\r\nto distinguish the species. Found from September to October.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bovista. Dill._\r\n\r\nThe genus Bovista differs from Lycoperdon in several ways. When the\r\nBovista ripens it breaks from its moorings and is blown about by the\r\nwind. It opens by an apical mouth, as does the genus Lycoperdon, but the\r\nspecies of Bovista have no sterile base. They are puffballs of small\r\nsize. The outer coat is thin and fragile and at maturity peels off,\r\nleaving an inner coat firm, papery, and elastic, just such a coat as is\r\nsuitable for the dispersion of its spores. Leaving its moorings at\r\nmaturity, it is blown about the fields and woods, and with every tumble\r\nit makes it scatters some of its spores. It may take years to accomplish\r\nthis perfectly. The species of the Lycoperdon do not leave their\r\nmoorings naturally; their spores are dispersed through an apical mouth\r\nby a collapse of the walls of the peridium, after the fashion of a\r\nbellows, by which spores are driven out to the pleasure of the wind. In\r\nBovista the threads are free or separate from the peridium, but in\r\nLycoperdon they arise from the peridium and also from the columella.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bovista pila. B. & C._\r\n\r\nTHE BALL-LIKE BOVISTA.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate LXIII. Figure 471.--Bovista pila.\r\n\r\nNatural size of matured specimens.]\r\n\r\nPila means a round ball. The peridium is globe-like, sessile, with a\r\nstout mycelium, a cortex thin, white at first, then brown, forming a\r\nsmooth continuous coat, breaking up at maturity and rapidly\r\ndisappearing.\r\n\r\nThe inner peridium is tough, parchment-like, elastic, smooth,\r\npersistent, purplish-brown, fading to gray. The dispersion of spores\r\ntakes place through an apical mouth. The capillitium is firm, compact,\r\npersistent, at first clay-colored, then purple-brown; threads\r\nsmall-branched, the ends being rigid, straight, pointed. There is\r\nsomething so noticeable about this little tumbler that you will know it\r\nwhen you see it, and if you often ramble over the fields you will soon\r\nmeet it. However, I have as yet seen only the matured specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bovista plumbea. Pers._\r\n\r\nLEAD-COLORED BOVISTA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 472.--Bovista plumbea. Natural size. White when\r\nyoung.]\r\n\r\nThe plant is small, never growing to more than an inch and a fourth in\r\ndiameter. The peridium is depressed globose, with a fibrous mycelium.\r\nThe outer peridium is rather thick and when the plant is nearing\r\nmaturity it breaks up readily unless handled very carefully; at maturity\r\nit scales off, except a small portion about the base. The outer peridium\r\nis white and comparatively smooth, the inner is thin, tough, smooth,\r\nlead-colored, dehiscent at the apex by a round or oblong mouth. Mass of\r\nspores and capillitium not solid or hard; yellowish-brown, or\r\nolivaceous, then purplish-brown; the threads three to five times\r\nbranched, the ends of the branches slender and tapering to a point. The\r\nspores are oval and smooth, with long transparent pedicels.\r\n\r\nThis species grows on the ground in old pastures, being quite plentiful\r\nafter warm rains, from the first of May till fall. It is one of the best\r\nof the puffballs, but should be eaten before the inner peridium begins\r\nto assume the tough form.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bovistella. Morgan._\r\n\r\nBovistella, a diminutive of Bovista, though the plants are usually\r\nlarger than the Bovistas.\r\n\r\nThe mycelium is cord-like; peridium nearly round, cortex a dense\r\nfloccose coat; inner peridium thin, strong, elastic, opening by an\r\napical mouth; subgleba present, cup-shaped; threads free and separate,\r\nbranched; spores white. The genus Bovistella has the internal character\r\nof Bovista, and the habits of Lycoperdon.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Bovistella Ohiensis. Morgan._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 473.--Bovistella Ohiensis. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nPeridium globe-like or broadly obovoid, sometimes much depressed, with\r\nsmall plications or wrinkles underneath, and a thick cord-like base or\r\nroot, as will be seen in Figure 473. The outer coat is dense, floccose,\r\nor with soft warts or spines, white or grayish, drying to a buff color,\r\nand in time falling away; the inner coat is smooth, shining, with a pale\r\nbrown or yellowish surface. The subgleba is large, occupying half of the\r\nperidium, extending up on the walls of the peridium, making it\r\ncup-shaped, and quite persistent. The spores and capillitium are rather\r\nloose, friable, clay-color to pale-brown. The threads, originating\r\nwithin the spore mass, and having no connection with the inner coat, are\r\nfree, short, three to five times branching; branches tapering to the\r\nend. The spores are round to oval, with long translucent pedicels.\r\n\r\nThis can be readily distinguished from the species of Bovista because it\r\nhas a sterile base; and from Lycoperdon because its threads are separate\r\nand free, while those of the Lycoperdon are attached both to the tissues\r\nof the inner peridium and to the columella or sterile base.\r\n\r\nThey are found growing on the ground in old pastures, or in open woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scleroderma. Pers._\r\n\r\nScleroderma is from two Greek words: _scleros_, hard; _derma_, skin.\r\n\r\nThe peridium is firm, single, generally thick, usually bursting\r\nirregularly, and exposing the gleba, which is of uniform texture and\r\nconsistency. There is no capillitium, but yellow flocci are found\r\ninterspersed with the spores. The spores are globose, rough, usually\r\nmixed with the hyphæ tissue.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scleroderma aurantium. Pers._\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON SCLERODERMA. EDIBLE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate LXIV. Figure 474.--Scleroderma aurantium.\r\n\r\nNatural size, showing a section of a young specimen.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 475.--Scleroderma aurantium.]\r\n\r\nAurantium means colored like an orange. This is usually called S.\r\nvulgare. The peridium is rough, warty, depressed, globose, corky and\r\nhard, yellowish, opening by irregular fissures to scatter the spores;\r\ninner mass bluish-black, spores dingy. The plant remains solid until it\r\nis quite old. It is sessile, with a rooting base which is never sterile.\r\n\r\nI have followed Mr. Lloyd's classification in separating the species,\r\ncalling the rough-surfaced one S. aurantium, and the smooth-surfaced S.\r\ncepa.\r\n\r\nIn labeling it edible I wish only to indicate that it is not poisonous,\r\nas it is generally thought to be; however, it cannot be claimed as a\r\nvery good article of food.\r\n\r\nIt has a wide distribution over the states. The plants in Figure 475\r\nwere found on Cemetery Hill, Chillicothe, and photographed by Dr.\r\nKellerman. Found from August to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scleroderma tenerum. Berk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 476.--Scleroderma tenerum.]\r\n\r\nThis species is often regarded as a small form of S. verrucosum, but it\r\nalways seemed strange to me that this rather smooth plant should be\r\ncalled \"verrucosum\" when its frequently near neighbor, S. aurantium, is\r\nvery verrucose.\r\n\r\nS. tenerum is a very widely distributed species in the United States,\r\nsomewhat constant as to form and quite frequent in occurrence. Mr.\r\nLloyd, in his Mycological Notes, gives a very clear photograph of a\r\nplant that is quite local in this country and which he thinks should be\r\ncalled S. verrucosum of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe plant differs very widely from the one we find so commonly which by\r\nmany authors has been called S. verrucosum. Some have even called it\r\nScleroderma bovista.\r\n\r\nThe plant is nearly sessile, somewhat irregular, peridium thin, soft,\r\nyellowish, densely marked with small scales, dehiscence irregular,\r\nflocci yellow and spores dingy olive.\r\n\r\nThe species may be known by the thin and comparatively smooth peridium\r\nand yellow flocci. It is quite common in the United States, while the\r\ntypical plant, S. verrucosum, is confined to a few localities along the\r\nAtlantic coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scleroderma Cepa. Pers._\r\n\r\nCepa meaning an onion; having very much the appearance of an onion.\r\n\r\nThe peridium is thick, smooth, reddish-yellow to reddish-brown, opening\r\nby an irregular mouth. The plant is sessile and quite strongly rooted\r\nwith fine rootlets. Its habitat, with us, is along the banks of small\r\nbrooks in the woods. It has been classed heretofore as S. vulgare,\r\nsmooth variety. I sent some to Prof. Peck, who quite agrees that they\r\nshould be separated from S. vulgare. Found from August to November.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scleroderma geaster. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nPlate LXV. Figure 477.--Scleroderma geaster.]\r\n\r\nGeaster, so called because it has a star-like opening somewhat similar\r\nto the genus Geaster.\r\n\r\nPeridium subglobose, thick, with a very short stem, or almost--sometimes\r\nentirely--sessile; hard, rough, splitting into irregular stellate limbs;\r\nfrequently well buried in the ground. Inner mass dark-brown or blackish,\r\nsometimes with rather a purplish tinge. Some grow quite large with the\r\nperidium very thick. My attention was first attracted by some of the\r\nperidium shells upon the ground on Cemetery Hill. The plant is quite\r\nabundant there from September to December.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Catastoma. Morgan._\r\n\r\nThis is a small puffball-like plant, growing just beneath the ground and\r\nattached to its bed by very small threads which issue from every part of\r\nthe cortex, which is quite thick. Breaking away at maturity in a\r\ncircumscissile manner, the lower part is held fast to the ground, while\r\nthe upper part remains attached to the inner peridium as a kind of cup.\r\nThe inner peridium, with the top part of the outer peridium attached,\r\nbecomes loose and tumbles over the ground, the mouth being in the base\r\nof the plant as it grew.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Catastoma circumscissum. B. & C._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 478.--Catastoma circumscissum.]\r\n\r\nCircumscissum means divided into halves.\r\n\r\nThe peridium is usually round, more or less depressed, commonly rough\r\nbecause of the soil attached; the larger part of the plant remaining in\r\nthe soil as a cup; the upper part with the inner peridium,\r\ndepressed-globose, thin, pallid, becoming gray, with branny scales, with\r\na small basal mouth. A thin spongy layer will frequently be seen between\r\nthe outer and inner peridium. The mass of the spores is olivaceous,\r\nchanging to pale-brown. The spores are round, minutely warted, 4-5µ. in\r\ndiameter, often with very short pedicels.\r\n\r\nThe plants are usually found in pastures along paths. I have seen them\r\nin several parts of Ohio. They are found from Maine to the western\r\nmountains. This is called Bovista circumscissa by Berkeley.\r\n\r\nThere is a species of a western range called C. subterraneum. This\r\ndiffers mainly in having larger spores. It seems to be confined to the\r\nmiddle west. However, it does not grow under the ground, as its name\r\nwould suggest.\r\n\r\nThere is also another species called C. pedicellatum. This species seems\r\nto be confined to the southern states and differs mainly in the spores\r\nhaving marked pedicels and closely warted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Podaxineæ._\r\n\r\nThis tribe is characterized by having a stalk continuous with the apex\r\nof the peridium, forming an axis. Some of the plants are short stalked,\r\nsome long stalked. The tribe forms a natural connecting link between the\r\nGastromycetes and the Agarics. Thus: Podaxon is a true Gastromycetes,\r\nwith capillitia mixed with spores; Caulogossum, with its permanent gleba\r\nchambers, is close to the Hymenogasters; Secotium is only a step from\r\nCaulogossum, the tramal plates being more sinuate-lamellate; and\r\nMontagnites, which is usually placed with the Agarics, is only a\r\nGyrophragmium with the plates truly lamellate.\r\n\r\n\r\nKEY TO THE GENERA.\r\n\r\n  Gleba with irregular, persistent chambers--\r\n    Peridium, elongated club-shaped                        Cauloglossum.\r\n    Peridium, round or conical, and dehiscing by breaking\r\n      away at the base                                     Secotium.\r\n  Gleba with sinuate-lamellate plates                      Gyrophragmium.\r\n  Walls of gleba chambers not persistent                   Podaxon.\r\n\r\n  --_Lloyd._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Secotium. Kunz._\r\n\r\nThis is a very interesting genus. When I found my first specimen I was\r\nmuch in doubt whether it was an Agaric or a puffball, as it seemed to be\r\na sort of connecting link between the two classes. The genus is divided\r\ninto smooth-spored and rough-spored species, both having a stalk\r\ncontinuing, as an axis, to the apex of the plant. The peridium is round\r\nor conical and it dehisces by breaking away at the base. Secotium is\r\nfrom a Greek word meaning chamber.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Secotium acuminatum. Montagne._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 479.--Secotium acuminatum. Life size of small\r\nspecimens.]\r\n\r\nThis is an exceedingly variable species, as found about Chillicothe, yet\r\nthe variability extends only to the outward appearance of the plant;\r\nsome are almost round, slightly depressed, some (and a large majority)\r\nare inclined to be irregularly cone-shaped.\r\n\r\nThe peridium is light-colored, of a soft texture, not brittle; it slowly\r\nexpels its spores by breaking away at the base; the stalk is usually\r\nshort, but distinct and prolonged to the apex of the peridium, forming\r\nan axis for the gleba. The surface of the peridium is smooth,\r\ndingy-white or ash-colored, with minute white spots, due to scales. It\r\nis of various shapes; acute-ovate, sometimes obtuse, nearly spherical,\r\nsometimes slightly depressed and irregular cone-shaped. The gleba is\r\ncomposed of semi-persistent cells, plainly seen with a glass or even\r\nwith the naked eye. It has no capillitium. The spores are globose and\r\nsmooth, often apiculate. This plant is quite abundant about Chillicothe,\r\nand I have found it from the first of May to the last of October.\r\n\r\nThis species is widely distributed in America, and occurs in Northern\r\nAfrica and Eastern Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polysaccum. DeC._\r\n\r\nPolysaccum is from _polus_, many, and _saccus_, a sack. Peridium\r\nirregularly globose, thick, attenuated downward into a stem-like base,\r\nopening by disintegration of its upper portion; internal mass or gleba\r\ndivided into distinct sac-like cells.\r\n\r\nAllied to Scleroderma and distinguished by the cavities of the gleba\r\ncontaining distinct peridioles. _Massee._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Polysaccum pisocarpium. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 480.--Polysaccum pisocarpium.]\r\n\r\nPisocarpium is from two Greek words meaning pea and fruited.\r\n\r\nPeridium irregularly globose, indistinctly nodulose, passing downward\r\ninto a stout stem-like base, peridioles irregularly angular, 4-5×3µ,\r\nyellow. Spores globose, warted, coffee-color, 9-13µ. _Massee._\r\n\r\nI have found this plant only a few times about Chillicothe. Mr. Lloyd\r\nidentified it for me. It has very much the shape of a pear. The skin is\r\nquite hard, smooth, olivaceous-black with yellow mottling patches not\r\nunlike the skin of a rattlesnake. The peridioles, which are small ovate\r\nsacs bearing the spores within, are very distinct. The interior of the\r\nplant when mature is dark, and it breaks and disintegrates from the\r\nupper part very like C. cyathiformis. This is a very interesting plant\r\nwhose ovate sac-like cells will easily distinguish it. Found from August\r\nto October, it delights in sandy soil, in pine or mixed woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mitremyces. Nees._\r\n\r\nMitremyces is made up of two words: _mitre_, a cap; _myces_, a mushroom.\r\nIt is a small genus, there being but three species found in this\r\ncountry. The spore-mass or gleba, in its young state, is surrounded by\r\nfour layers. The outer layer is gelatinous and behaves itself somewhat\r\ndifferently in each species. This outer layer is known as the volva or\r\nvolva-like peridium, which soon disappears. The next layer is called\r\nthe exoperidium and is composed of two layers, the inner one quite thin\r\nand cartilaginous--in M. cinnabarinus it is a bright red; this is\r\nattached to a rather thick, gelatinous, outer layer which soon falls\r\naway, exposing the endoperidium, which is the layer seen in older\r\nspecimens. Within the endoperidium are the spores, which are pale\r\nochraceous or sulphur color, globose or elliptical in shape. They are\r\ncontained in a separate membrane or sac; when they mature the sac\r\ncontracts and forces the spores out into the air. The mycelium of this\r\nplant is especially peculiar, being composed of a bundle of root-like\r\nstrands, translucent and jelly-like when young and fresh, but becoming\r\ntough and hard. This genus is called by some authors Calostoma, meaning\r\na beautiful mouth, a very appropriate name, as the mouths of all\r\nAmerican species are red and quite beautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mitremyces cinnabarinus. Desv._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 481.--Mitremyces cinnabarinus. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe rooting strands are long, compact, dark when dry. Exporidium bright\r\nred, smooth internally; the outer layer thick, gelatinous when fresh,\r\nfinally breaking into areas and curling inward. The separation is caused\r\nby the fact that the cells of the thick gelatinous portion expand by the\r\nabsorption of water, while those of the inner layer do not, hence the\r\nrupture occurs. The endoperidium and rayed mouth are bright red when\r\nfresh, partially fading in old specimens.\r\n\r\nThe spores are elliptical-oblong, punctate-sculptured, varying much as\r\nto size in specimens from different localities; 6-8×10-14 in West\r\nVirginia specimens. Massachusetts specimens, 6-8×12-20. _Lloyd._\r\n\r\nI have seen these specimens growing in the mountains in West Virginia.\r\nThey quickly arrest the attention because of their bright red caps. They\r\nseem not, as yet, to have crossed the Alleghenies--at least I have not\r\nfound it in Ohio. It has a number of synonyms: Scleroderma calostoma,\r\nCalostoma cinnabarinum, Lycoperdon heterogeneum, L. calostoma.\r\n\r\nThe plants in Figure 481 were photographed by Dr. Kellerman. Mr. Geo. E.\r\nMorris of Waltham, Mass., sent me some specimens early in August, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geaster. Mich._\r\n\r\nGeaster, an earth-star; so called because at maturity the outer coat\r\nbreaks its connection with the mycelium in the ground and bursts open\r\nlike the petals of a flower; then, becoming reflexed, those petals lift\r\nthe inner ball from the ground and it remains in the center of the\r\nexpanded, star-like coat. The coat of the inner ball is thin and papery,\r\nand opens by an apical mouth. The threads, or capillitium, which bear\r\nthe spores proceed from the walls of the peridium and form the central\r\ncolumella. The threads are simple, long, slender, thickest in the middle\r\nand tapering towards the ends, fixed at one end and free at the other.\r\n\r\nThe Geaster is a picturesque little plant which will arrest the\r\nattention of the most careless observer. It is abundant and is\r\nfrequently found in the late summer and fall in woods and pastures.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geaster minimus. Schw._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 482.--Geaster minimus. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe outer coat or exoperidium recurved, segments acute at the apex,\r\neight to twelve segments divided to about the middle. Mycelial layer\r\nusually attached, generally shaggy with fragments of leaves or grass,\r\nsometimes partly or entirely separating. Fleshy layer closely attached,\r\nvery light in color, usually smooth on the limb of the exoperidium but\r\ncracked on the segments. Pedicel short but distinct. The inner peridium\r\novoid, one-fourth to one-half inch in diameter; white to pale-brown,\r\nsometimes almost black. Mouth lifted on a slight cone, lip bordered with\r\na hair-like fringe; columella slender, as are also the threads. Spores\r\nbrown, globe-shaped, and minutely warted. Found in the summer and early\r\nfall.\r\n\r\nNature seems to give it the power to lift up the spore-bearing body, the\r\nbetter to eject its spores to the wind. It is very frequently found in\r\npastures all over the state. I have found it in many localities about\r\nChillicothe. It is called \"minimus\" because it is the smallest\r\nEarth-star.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geaster hygrometricus. Pers._\r\n\r\nWATER-MEASURING EARTH-STAR.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 483.--Geaster hygrometricus. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe unexpanded plant is nearly spherical. The mycelial layer is thin,\r\ntearing away as the plant expands, the bark or skin falling with the\r\nmycelium. The outer coat is deeply parted, the segments, acute at the\r\napex, four to twenty; strongly hygrometric, becoming reflexed when the\r\nplant is moist, strongly incurved when the plant is dry. The inner\r\ncoating is nearly spherical, thin, sessile, opening by simply a torn\r\naperture. There is no columella. The threads are transparent, much\r\nbranched, and interwoven. The spores are large, globose, and rough.\r\n\r\nThe plant ripens in the fall and the thick outer peridium divides into\r\nsegments, the number varying from four to twenty. When the weather is\r\nwet the lining of the points of the segments become gelatinous and\r\nrecurve, and the points rest upon the ground, holding the inner ball\r\nfrom the ground. In dry weather the soft gelatinous lining becomes hard\r\nand the segments curve in and clasp the inner ball. Hence its name,\r\n\"hygrometricus,\" a measurer of moisture. The plant is quite general.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geaster Archeri. Berk._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 484.--Geaster Archeri.]\r\n\r\nYoung plant acute. Exoperidium cut beyond the middle into seven to nine\r\nacute segments. In herbarium specimens usually saccate but sometimes\r\nrevolute. Mycelial layer closely adherent, compared to previous species\r\nrelatively smooth. As in the previous species the mycelium covers the\r\nyoung plant but is not so strongly developed, so that the adhering dirt\r\nis not so evident on the mature plant. Fleshy layer when dry, thin and\r\nclosely adherent. Endoperidium globose, sessile. Mouth sulcate,\r\nindefinite. Columella globose-clavate. Capillitium thicker than the\r\nspores. Spores small, 4 mc. almost smooth. _Lloyd._\r\n\r\nI first found the plant in the young state. The acute point, which will\r\nbe seen in the photograph, puzzled me. I marked the place where it grew\r\nand in a few days found the developed Geaster. The plant is\r\nreddish-brown and it differs from other species \"with sulcate mouths, in\r\nits closely sessile endoperidium.\" I have found the plant several times\r\nin Hayne's Hollow, near Chillicothe. I found it in the tracks of decayed\r\nlogs.\r\n\r\nThe plant has been called Geaster Morganii in this country but had\r\npreviously been named from Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geaster asper. Michelius._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 485.--Geaster asper. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nExoperidium revolute, cut to about the middle in eight to ten segments.\r\nBoth mycelial and fleshy layers are more closely adherent than in most\r\nspecies. Pedicel _short_ and _thick_. Inner peridium subglobose,\r\n_verrucose_. Mouth conical, beaked, strongly sulcate, seated on a\r\ndepressed zone. Columella prominent, persistent. Capillitium threads\r\nsimple, long tapering. Spores globose, rough.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic of this plant is the verrucose inner peridium. Under\r\na glass of low power it appears as though the peridium were densely\r\ncovered with grains of sharp sand. This plant alone has this\r\ncharacteristic, to our knowledge; and although it is indicated in the\r\nfigures of G. cornatus of both Schaeffer and Schmidel, we think that\r\nthere it is only an exaggeration of the very _minute_ granular\r\nappearance cornatus has. The word \"asper\" is the first descriptive\r\nadjective applied by Michelius. Fries included it in his complex\r\nstriatus. _Lloyd._\r\n\r\nI have found the plant frequently about Chillicothe. The plants\r\nrepresented were photographed by Mr. Lloyd.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geaster triplex. Jung._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plate LXVI. Figure 486.--Geaster triplex.]\r\n\r\nThe unexpanded plant acute. Exoperidium recurved (or, when not fully\r\nexpanded, somewhat saccate at base), cut to the middle (or usually\r\ntwo-thirds) in five to eight segments. Mycelial layer adnate. Fleshy\r\nlayer generally peeling off from the segments of the fibrillose layer\r\nbut usually remaining partially free, as a cup at base of inner\r\nperidium. Inner peridium subglobose, closely sessile. Mouth definite,\r\nfibrillose, broadly conical. Columella prominent, elongated. Threads\r\nthicker than spores. Spores globose, roughened, 3-6 mc. _Lloyd_, in\r\nMycological Notes.\r\n\r\nThe color of Geaster triplex is reddish-brown. Notice the remains of a\r\nfleshy layer forming a cup at base of inner peridium, a point which\r\ndistinguishes this species and which gives name to the species--triplex,\r\nthree folds or apparently three layers. The photograph was made by Dr.\r\nKellerman.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geaster saccatus. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 487.--Geaster saccatus. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nThe unexpanded plant is globose. Mycelium is universal. Exoperidium cut\r\nin six to ten segments about half way, the limb deeply saccate. Mycelial\r\nlayer adnate to fibrillose. Fleshy layer, when dry, thin, adnate. Inner\r\nperidium sessile, globose, with a determinate fibrillose mouth.\r\n\r\nThe spores are globose, almost smooth. _Lloyd._\r\n\r\nMr. Lloyd thinks this plant is practically the same as the G. fimbriatus\r\nof Europe, differing from it in being more deeply saccate and having a\r\ndeterminate mouth. This plant is very common on all the wooded hillsides\r\nabout Chillicothe. I have seen the ground on the top of Mt. Logan almost\r\ncompletely covered with them. They are identified by Mr. Lloyd, Prof.\r\nAtkinson, and Dr. Peck. The plants in Figure 487 were photographed by\r\nMr. Lloyd from typical specimens.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geaster mammosus. Chev._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 488.--Geaster mammosus.]\r\n\r\nExporidium thin, rigid, hygroscopic, smooth, divided almost to the base\r\ninto about ten linear segments, often umbilicate at the base; inner\r\nperidium globose, smooth, sessile, furnished with a conical, even,\r\nprotruding mouth, seated on a definite area.\r\n\r\nColumella short, globose, evident (though distinct in mature plants).\r\n\r\nCapillitium simple, tapering, hyaline, often flattened, slightly thinner\r\nthan the spores. Spores globose, roughened, 3-7 mc. _Lloyd._\r\n\r\nThis plant is found in the woods from July till late in the fall. It\r\ndiffers from G. hygrometricus by its even, conical mouth. I found\r\nspecimens several times in Haynes's Hollow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geaster velutinus. Morg._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 489.--Geaster velutinus.]\r\n\r\nUnexpanded plants globose, sometimes slightly pointed at apex. Mycelium\r\nbasal. Outer layer rigid, membranaceous, firm, light colored in the\r\nAmerican plant. The surface is covered with short, dense, appressed\r\nvelumen, so that to the eye the surface appears simply dull and rough,\r\nbut its true nature is readily seen under a glass of low power.\r\n\r\nThe outer surface separates from the inner as the plant expands, and in\r\nmature specimens is usually partly free. The thickness and texture of\r\nthe two layers are about the same. The fleshy layer is dark\r\nreddish-brown when dry, a thin adnate layer. Inner peridium sessile,\r\ndark colored, globose, with a broad base and pointed mouth. Mouth even,\r\nmarked with a definite circular light-colored basal zone. Columella\r\nelongated, clavate. Spores globose, almost smooth, small, 2½-3½ mc.\r\n_Lloyd._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Myriostoma coliformis. Dick._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 490.--Myriostoma coliformis. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nExporidium usually recurved, cut to about the middle into six to ten\r\nlobes; if collected and dried when first open, rather firm and rigid;\r\nwhen exposed to weather becoming like parchment paper by the peeling off\r\nof the inner and outer layers. Inner peridium, subglobose, supported on\r\nseveral more or less confluent pedicels. Surface minutely roughened;\r\nmouths several, appressed fibrillose, round, plain or slightly elevated;\r\ncolumellæ several, filiform, probably the same in number as the\r\npedicels; spores globose, roughened, 3-6 mc.; capillitium simple,\r\nunbranched, long, tapering, about half diameter of spores.\r\n\r\nThe inner peridium with its several mouths can be, not inaptly, compared\r\nto a \"pepper-box.\" The specific name is derived from the Latin _colum_,\r\na strainer, and the old English name we find in Berkeley \"Cullender\r\npuffball\" refers to a cullender (or colander more modern form) now\r\nalmost obsolete in English, but meaning a kind of strainer. _Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFound in sandy soil. It is quite rare. Both the generic and specific\r\nnames refer to its many mouths. The specimens in Figure 490 were found\r\non Green Island, Lake Erie, one of the points where this rare species is\r\nfound. It is found at Cedar Point, Ohio, also. The plant was\r\nphotographed by Prof. Schaffner of the Ohio State University.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nFAMILY--SPHAERIACEAE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPerithecia carbonaceous or membranaceous, sometimes confluent with the\r\nstroma, pierced at the apex, and mostly papillate; hymenium\r\ndiffluent.--_Berkeley Outlines._\r\n\r\nThere are four tribes in this family, viz:\r\n\r\n  Nectriæi.\r\n  Xylariæi.\r\n  Valsei.\r\n  Sphæriei.\r\n\r\nUnder Nectriæi we have the following genera:\r\n\r\n  Stipitate--\r\n    Clavate or capitate                                       Cordyceps.\r\n    Head globose, base sclerotioid                            Claviceps.\r\n  Parasitic on grass--\r\n    Stroma myceloid                                           Epichloe.\r\n  Variable--\r\n    Sporidia double, finally separating                       Hypocrea.\r\n    Sporidia double, ejected in tendrils, parasitic on fungi  Hypomyces.\r\n  Stroma definite, perithecia free, clustered or scattered    Nectria.\r\n  Perithecia erect, in a polished and colored sac             Oomyces.\r\n    Under Xylariæi we have:\r\n  Stipitate--\r\n    Stroma corky, subelavate                                  Xylaria.\r\n    Stroma somewhat corky, discoid                            Poronia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cordyceps. Fr._\r\n\r\nCordyceps is from a Greek word meaning a club and a Latin word meaning a\r\nhead. It is a genus of Pyrenomycetous fungi of which a few grow upon\r\nother fungi, but by far the greater number are parasitic upon insects or\r\ntheir larva, as will be seen in Figure 491.\r\n\r\nThe spores enter the breathing openings along the sides of the larva and\r\nthe mycelium grows until it fills the interior of the larva and kills\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn fructification a stalk rises from the body of the insect or larva and\r\nin the enlarged extremity of this the perithecia are grouped. The stroma\r\nis vertical and fleshy, head distinct, hyaline or colored; sporidia\r\nrepeatedly divided and sub-moniliform.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cordyceps Herculea._ (_Schw._) _Sacc._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 491.--Cordyceps herculea. Showing the grub upon\r\nwhich this species grows.]\r\n\r\nHerculea is so called from its large size. The halftone will readily\r\nidentify this species. The plant is quite large, clavate in form, the\r\nhead oblong, round, slightly tapering upward with a decided protuberance\r\nat the apex, as will be seen in Figure 491. The head is a light yellow\r\nin all specimens I found, not alutaceous as Schw. states, nor is the\r\nhead obtuse. I found several specimens on a sidehill in Haynes's Hollow\r\nin August and September, all growing from bodies of the large white\r\ngrubs which are found about rotten wood. They were found during wet\r\nweather. They were identified by both Dr. Peck and Dr. Herbst.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cordyceps militaris. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 492.--Cordyceps militaris.]\r\n\r\nThis is much smaller and more common than C. Herculea.\r\nConidia--Subcæspitose, white; stem distinct, simple, becoming smooth;\r\nclubs incrassated, mealy; Conidia globose. Ascophore--Fleshy,\r\norange-red; head clavate, tuberculose; stem equal; sporidia long,\r\nbreaking up into joints. This is frequently called Torrubia militaris.\r\n\r\nIt is known as the caterpillar fungus. Its spores are cylindrical and\r\nare produced upon orange-red fruiting bodies in the fall. As soon as the\r\nspore falls on the caterpillar it sends out germ-threads which penetrate\r\nthe caterpillar. Here the threads form long narrow spores which break\r\noff and form other spores until the body-cavity is entirely filled. The\r\ncaterpillar soon becomes sluggish and dies. The fungus continues to grow\r\nuntil it has completely appropriated all of the insect's soft parts,\r\nexternally a perfect caterpillar but internally completely filled with\r\nmycelial threads. Under favorable conditions this mycelial caterpillar,\r\nwhich has become a storage organ, will send up an orange-red club-shaped\r\nbody, as will be seen in Figure 492, and will produce the kind of spores\r\ndescribed above. Under some conditions this mycelial caterpillar may be\r\nmade to produce a dense growth of threads from its entire surface,\r\nlooking like a small white ball, and from these threads another kind of\r\nspore is formed. These spores are pinched off in great numbers and will\r\ngerminate in the larva the same as the sac spore. The specimens were\r\nfound by Mrs. E. B. Blackford near Boston, and photographed by Dr.\r\nKellerman.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cordyceps capitata. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Photo by C. G. Lloyd._\r\n\r\nFigure 493.--Cordyceps capitata. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nThis plant is fleshy, capitate, head ovate, bay-brown, stem yellow, then\r\nblackish.\r\n\r\nThis plant is parasitic on Elaphomyces granulatus. It is shown at the\r\nbase of the stem of the plant. It grows two or three inches under the\r\nsurface and somewhat resembles a truffle in appearance.\r\n\r\nBoth are very interesting plants. The plant in Figure 493 was found near\r\nBoston, Mass. They are usually found in pine woods, often in tufts. The\r\nstems are from one to four inches long, nearly equal, smooth,\r\nlemon-colored, at length fibroso-strigose and blackish.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes called Torrubia capitata.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nMYXOMYCETES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plants under this head belong to the slime-moulds and at first are\r\nwholly gelatinous. All the species and genera are small and easily\r\noverlooked, yet they are intensely interesting when carefully observed.\r\nIn the morning you may see a mass of gelatinous matter and in the\r\nevening a beautiful net work of threads and spores, the transformation\r\nbeing so rapid. This gelatinous mass is known as protoplasm or\r\nplasmodium, and the motive power of the plasmodium has suggested to many\r\nthat they should be placed in the animal kingdom, or called fungus\r\nanimals. The same is true of Schizomycetes, to which all the bacteria,\r\nbacillus, spirillum, and vibrio, and a number of other groups belong. I\r\nhave only a few Myxomycetes to present. I have watched the development\r\nof a number of plants of this group, but because of the scarcity of\r\nliterature upon the subject I have been unable to identify them\r\nsatisfactorily.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lycogala epidendrum. Fr._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 494.--Lycogala epidendrum.]\r\n\r\nThis is called the Stump Lycogala. It is quite common, seeming in a\r\ncertain stage to be a small puffball. The peridium has a double\r\nmembrane, papery, persistent, bursting irregularly at the apex;\r\nexternally minutely warty, nearly round, blood-red or pinkish, then\r\nbrownish; mouth irregular; spores becoming pale, or violet.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Reticularia maxima. Fr._\r\n\r\nThis is quite common on partially decayed logs. The peridium is very\r\nthin, tuberculose, effused, delicate, olivaceous-brown; spores olive,\r\nechinulate or spiny.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Didymius xanthopus. Fr._\r\n\r\nThese are very small yellow-stemmed plants, found on oak leaves in wet\r\nweather. The sporangium has an inner membranaceous peridium; the whole\r\nis round, brown, whitish. The stem is elongated, even, yellow. The\r\ncolumella is stipitate into the sporangia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_D. cinereum. Fr._\r\n\r\nSporangia sessile, round, whitish, covered with an ashy-gray scurf.\r\nSpores black. Very small. On fallen oak leaves. Easily overlooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Xylaria. Schrank._\r\n\r\nXylaria means pertaining to wood. It is usually vertical, more or less\r\nstipitate. The stroma is between fleshy and corky, covered with a black\r\nor rufous bark.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Xylaria polymorpha. Grev._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 495.--Xylaria polymorpha. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nPolymorpha means many forms. It is nearly fleshy, a number usually\r\ngrowing together, or gregarious; thickened as if swollen, irregular;\r\ndirty-white, then black; the receptacle bearing perithecia in every\r\npart.\r\n\r\nThis plant is quite common in our woods, growing about old stumps or on\r\ndecayed sticks or pieces of wood. The spore-openings can be seen with an\r\nordinary hand-glass.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Xylaria polymorpha, var. spathularia._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 496.--Xylaria polymorpha var. spathularia. Natural\r\nsize.]\r\n\r\nSpathularia means in the form of a spathula or spatula. It is vertical\r\nand stipitate, the stem being more definite than in the X. polymorpha,\r\nthe stroma being between fleshy and corky, frequently growing in\r\nnumbers or gregarious, turgid, fairly regular, dirty-white, then\r\nbrownish-red, finally black. An ordinary hand glass will show how it\r\nbears perithecia in all its parts. This will be clearly seen in the\r\nsection on the right.\r\n\r\nThese plants are not as common as the X. polymorpha, but are found in\r\nhabitats similar to those of the other plant, particularly around maple\r\nstumps or upon decayed maple branches.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stemonitis. Gled._\r\n\r\nStemonitis is from a Greek word which means stamen, one of the essential\r\norgans of a flower. This is a genus of myxomycetous fungi, giving name\r\nto the family Stemonitaceæ, which has a single sporangium or æthalium;\r\nwithout the peculiar deposits of lime carbonate which characterize the\r\nfructification of other orders, and the spores, capillitium, and\r\ncolumella are usually uniformly black, or brownish.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stemonitis fusca. Roth._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 497.--Stemonitis fusca. Natural size.]\r\n\r\nFusca means dark-brown, smoky. The sporangia are cylindrical and pointed\r\nat the apex, peridia fugacious, exposing the beautiful net-work of the\r\ncapillitium. The reticulate capillitium springs from the dark,\r\npenetrating stem.\r\n\r\nThis is a very beautiful plant when studied with an ordinary hand-glass.\r\nI have frequently seen an entire log covered with this plant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Stemonitis ferruginea. Ehrb._\r\n\r\nFerruginea means rust color. The sporangia is very similar to that of S.\r\nfusca, cylindrical, peridium fugacious, exposing the reticulate\r\ncapillitium, but instead of being dark-brown it is a yellowish or\r\nrusty-brown color.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nRECIPES FOR COOKING MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED MUSHROOMS. NO. 1.\r\n\r\nChoose them as nearly as possible of uniform size and free from insects.\r\nDrop them in salt water for five minutes to free them from any insects\r\nthat may be hidden in the gills; drain them and wipe dry and clean with\r\na rather rough cloth; cut off the stems close to the cap. Put them into\r\na granite or porcelain saucepan, cover closely and stew gently fifteen\r\nminutes. Salt to taste. Rub a tablespoonful of butter into about a\r\ntablespoonful of flour, and stir this into the mushrooms, letting boil\r\nthree or four minutes; stir in three tablespoonfuls of cream, mixed with\r\na well-beaten egg, and stir the whole for two minutes without letting it\r\nboil, and serve either on toast or as a vegetable.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEWED MUSHROOMS. NO. 2.\r\n\r\nClean mushrooms as directed above and stew in water ten minutes; then\r\ndrain off part of the water and put in as much warm milk as you have\r\npoured off water; let this stew for five to ten minutes; then add some\r\ndrawn butter, or veal or chicken gravy, and salt and pepper to taste.\r\nThicken with a little corn starch wet in cold milk. Serve hot.\r\n\r\nIn cooking mushrooms they should always be kept as closely covered as\r\npossible in order the better to retain the flavor, and they should never\r\nbe subjected to too great heat.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\nBe sure your mushrooms are fresh and free from insects; cut off the\r\nstems close to the caps and wipe the tops with a wet cloth. Arrange them\r\nin a pie dish with the gills uppermost, laying a little bit of butter on\r\neach; sprinkle pepper, salt, and a very little mace upon them. Put them\r\ninto a hot oven and bake from fifteen minutes to half an hour, according\r\nto the tenderness of the mushrooms; if they are in danger of getting too\r\ndry baste them occasionally with butter and water. Pour over them some\r\n_maitre d'hotel_ sauce and send to the table in the dish in which they\r\nwere baked.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROILED MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\nSelect the finest and freshest you can get and prepare as for baking;\r\nput into a deep dish and pour over them some melted butter, turning them\r\nover and over in it. Salt and pepper and let them lie for an hour and a\r\nhalf in the butter. Put them, gills uppermost, on an oyster gridiron\r\nover a clear hot fire, turning them over as one side browns. Put them on\r\na hot dish, having them well seasoned with butter, pepper, and salt and\r\nwith a few drops of lemon juice squeezed upon each, if liked.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOM AND VEAL RAGOUT.\r\n\r\nTake equal quantities of cold veal steak or roast veal and small\r\npuffballs or other mushrooms, and mince all fine; mince a small onion\r\nand put with the mushrooms and meat into a pan with some cold veal\r\ngravy, if you have it, and water enough to cover the mixture. Add a\r\ntablespoonful of butter, pepper and salt well, and let the mixture cook\r\nuntil it is almost dry, stirring it frequently to keep it from\r\nscorching; it should cook fully half an hour. When almost done, add a\r\nlarge tablespoonful of good catsup, or Worcestershire sauce if\r\npreferred. Serve hot.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOM PATÉS.\r\n\r\nWash mushrooms well, cut them into small pieces and drop them in salt\r\nwater for five minutes. Have ready in a pan upon the stove about two\r\nounces of butter to each pint of mushrooms, having pan and butter very\r\nhot but not scorching; dip the mushrooms from the salt water with a\r\nskimmer and drop them into the hot butter; cover them closely to retain\r\nthe flavor, shaking the pan or stirring them over to keep them from\r\nscorching or sticking. Let them cook with moderate heat from fifteen to\r\nthirty minutes, according to the tenderness of the mushrooms. Remove the\r\ncover from the pan, draw the mushrooms to one side and lift the pan on\r\none side so that the gravy will run down to the opposite side; stir into\r\nthe gravy a level tablespoonful of sifted flour, and rub this smooth\r\nwith the gravy; then add a half a pint of rich milk or cream; stir the\r\nmushrooms into this and allow it to boil for a minute. Have ready in the\r\noven some paté shells, fill them with the mushrooms, seasoned to taste\r\nwith salt and pepper, and set back in the oven for a few minutes to heat\r\nbefore serving. These are especially fine when made of Tricholoma\r\npersonatum or Pleurotus ostreatus, but many other varieties will answer\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKED BEEFSTEAK WITH MUSHROOM SAUCE.\r\n\r\nHave your sirloin steak cut an inch or more thick, put into an\r\nexceedingly hot baking pan on top of the stove, in one minute turn steak\r\nover so that both sides will be seared. Put the pan into an exceedingly\r\nhot oven and allow it to remain for twenty minutes.\r\n\r\nHave ready in a saucepan two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, heat well\r\nand add two cupfuls of fresh, clean mushrooms which have been allowed\r\nto stand in salt water for a period of five minutes; cover closely and\r\ncook briskly without burning for ten minutes; set on the back of the\r\nstove (after having seasoned them properly with salt and pepper) to keep\r\nhot until ready to use. Place the steak upon a hot dish, pour the\r\nmushrooms over it and send to the table at once. It is a dish fit for a\r\nking.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUFFED MORELS.\r\n\r\nChoose the freshest and best morels; cleanse them thoroughly by allowing\r\nthe water from the faucet to run on them; open the stalk at the bottom;\r\nfill with veal stuffing, anchovy or any rich forcemeat you choose,\r\nsecuring the ends and dressing between slices of bacon; bake for a half\r\nan hour, basting with butter and water, and serve with the gravy which\r\ncomes from them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIED MORELS.\r\n\r\nWash a dozen morels carefully and cut off the ends of the stems. Split\r\nthe mushrooms and put them into a pan in which two tablespoonfuls of\r\nbutter have been melted. Cover closely and cook with a moderate heat for\r\nfifteen minutes. Mix two teaspoonfuls of corn starch in a half a pint of\r\nfresh milk and pour into the pan with the mushrooms, allowing it to boil\r\nfor a minute or two; salt and pepper to taste and serve hot, upon toast\r\nif liked.\r\n\r\n\r\nTO COOK BOLETI.\r\n\r\nCut off the stems, and remove the spore-tubes, after having wiped the\r\ncaps clean with a damp cloth. They may be broiled in a hot buttered pan,\r\nturning them frequently until done, which will be about fifteen minutes.\r\nDust with salt and pepper and put bits of butter over them as you would\r\non broiled beefsteak.\r\n\r\nThey may be stewed in a little water in a covered saucepan, after being\r\ncut into pieces of equal size. Stew for twenty minutes and when done add\r\npepper, salt, butter or cream.\r\n\r\nOr they may be fried, after being sliced as you would egg plant, and\r\ndipped in batter or rolled in egg and cracker crumbs.\r\n\r\nIn preparing Boleti the spore tube should be removed unless very young,\r\nas they will make the dish slimy.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOM CATSUP.\r\n\r\nTo two quarts of mushrooms allow a quarter of a pound of salt. The full\r\ngrown mushrooms are better in making this as they afford more juice. Put\r\na layer of mushrooms in the bottom of a stone jar, sprinkle with salt;\r\nthen another layer of mushrooms till you have used all; let them lie\r\nthus for six hours, then break them into bits. Set in a cool place for\r\nthree days, stirring thoroughly every morning. Strain the juice from\r\nthem, and to every quart allow half an ounce of allspice, the same\r\nquantity of ginger, half a teaspoonful of powdered mace and half a\r\nteaspoonful of cayenne. Put it into a stone jar, cover it closely, set\r\nit in a saucepan of water over the fire, and boil hard for five hours.\r\nTake it off, empty it into a porcelain kettle and let it boil slowly for\r\nhalf an hour longer. Set it in a cool place and let it stand all night\r\nuntil settled and clear, then pour off carefully from the sediment, into\r\nsmall bottles, filling them to the mouth. Cork tightly and seal\r\ncarefully. Keep in a dry, cool, dark closet.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSHROOMS WITH BACON.\r\n\r\nTake some full-grown mushrooms, and, having cleaned them, procure a few\r\nrashers of nice streaky bacon and fry it in the usual manner. When\r\nnearly done add a dozen or so of mushrooms and fry them slowly until\r\nthey are cooked. In the cooking they will absorb all the fat of the\r\nbacon, and with the addition of a little salt and pepper will form a\r\nmost appetizing breakfast relish.\r\n\r\n\r\nHYDNUM.\r\n\r\nThe Hydnums are sometimes slightly bitter and it is well to boil them\r\nfor a few minutes and then throw away the water. Drain the mushrooms\r\ncarefully; add pepper and salt, butter, and milk; cook in a covered\r\nsaucepan slowly for twenty or twenty-five minutes; have ready some\r\nslices of toast, pour the mushrooms over these and serve at once.\r\n\r\n\r\nOYSTER MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\nOne of the best ways to cook an Oyster mushroom is to fry it as you fry\r\nan oyster. Use the tender part of the Oyster mushroom; clean thoroughly;\r\nadd pepper and salt; dip in beaten egg and then bread crumbs and fry in\r\nfat or butter. Or parboil them for forty-five minutes, drain, roll in\r\nflour and fry.\r\n\r\nThe Oyster mushroom is also excellent when stewed.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEPIOTA PROCERA.\r\n\r\nClean the caps with a damp cloth and cut off the stem close to the caps;\r\nbroil lightly on both sides over a clear fire or in a very hot pan,\r\nturning the mushrooms carefully three or four times; have ready some\r\nfreshly-made, well-buttered toast; arrange the mushrooms on the toast\r\nand put a small piece of butter on each and sprinkle with pepper and\r\nsalt; set in the oven or before a brisk fire to melt the butter, then\r\nserve quickly.\r\n\r\nSome persons think that slices of bacon toasted over the mushrooms\r\nimprove the flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEEFSTEAK SMOTHERED IN MUSHROOMS.\r\n\r\nHave ready a sufficient quantity of full-grown mushrooms, carefully\r\ncleaned; cut them in pieces and put into a baking pan with a\r\ntablespoonful of butter to two cupfuls of mushrooms, sprinkle with\r\npepper and salt, and bake in a moderate oven forty-five minutes. Broil\r\nyour steak until it is almost done; then put it into the pan with a part\r\nof the mushrooms under and the remainder over the steak; put it into the\r\noven again and allow it to remain for ten minutes; turn out upon a hot\r\ndish and serve quickly.\r\n\r\nAgaricus, Lepiota, Coprinus, Lactarius, Tricholoma, and Russula are\r\nespecially fine for this method of preparation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nCULTIVATION OF THE MUSHROOM.\r\n\r\nBY PROF. LAMBERT,\r\n\r\nThe American Spawn Co., St. Paul, Minn.\r\n\r\n\r\n=GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.=--Commercially, and in a restricted sense, the\r\nterm \"mushroom\" is generally used indiscriminately to designate the\r\nspecies of fungi which are edible and susceptible of cultivation. The\r\nvarieties which have been successfully cultivated for the market are\r\nnearly all derived from _Agaricus campestris_, _Agaricus villaticus_,\r\n_and Agaricus Arvensis_. They may be white, cream or creamy-white, or\r\nbrown; but the color is not always a permanent characteristic, it is\r\noften influenced by surrounding conditions.\r\n\r\nMushrooms are grown for the market on a large scale in France and in\r\nEngland. It is estimated that nearly twelve million pounds of fresh\r\nmushrooms are sold every year at the Central Market of Paris. A large\r\nquantity of mushrooms are canned and exported from France to every\r\ncivilized country. This industry has recently made remarkable progress\r\nin the United States, and fresh mushrooms are now regularly quoted on\r\nthe markets of our large cities. They are sold at prices ranging from\r\ntwenty-five cents to one dollar and fifty cents per pound, according to\r\nseason, demand and supply.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 498.--Mushroom Beds in a Cellar.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=ESSENTIAL CONDITIONS.=--Mushrooms can be grown in any climate and in\r\nany season where the essential conditions may be found, obtained or\r\ncontrolled. These conditions are, _first_, a temperature ranging from\r\n53° to 60° F., with extremes of 50° to 63°; _second_, an atmosphere\r\nsaturated (but not dripping) with moisture; _third_, proper ventilation;\r\n_fourth_, a suitable medium or bed; _fifth_, good spawn. It may be seen\r\nthat in the open air, these conditions are rarely found together for any\r\nlength of time. It is therefore necessary, in order to grow mushrooms on\r\na commercial basis, that one or more of these elements be artificially\r\nsupplied or controlled. This is usually done in cellars, caves, mines,\r\ngreenhouses, or specially constructed mushroom houses. A convenient\r\ndisposition of the shelves in a cellar is shown in Figure 498. A large\r\ninstallation for commercial purposes is shown in Figure 500, and a\r\nspecially constructed cellar is shown in Figure 499. Where abandoned\r\nmines, natural or artificial caves are available, the required\r\natmospheric conditions are often found combined and may be uniformly\r\nmaintained throughout the year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 499.--Specially Constructed Mushroom Houses.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 500.--Mushroom Houses, Flat Beds.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=TEMPERATURE.=--Within the limits prescribed, the temperature should be\r\nuniform throughout the growth of the crop. When too cold, the\r\ndevelopment of the spawn will be retarded or arrested. A high\r\ntemperature will favor the development of molds and bacteria which will\r\nsoon destroy the spawn or the growing crop. The cultivation of the\r\nmushroom, as a summer crop, is therefore greatly restricted. As a fall,\r\nwinter or spring crop it may be grown wherever means are at hand to\r\nraise the temperature to about 58° F. Many florists are utilizing the\r\nwaste space under the benches for that purpose; they have the advantage\r\nof being able to use the expended material of mushroom beds in growing\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n=MOISTURE.=--Moisture is an important factor in the cultivation of the\r\nmushroom, and demands intelligent application. The mushroom requires an\r\natmosphere nearly saturated with moisture, and yet the direct\r\napplication of water on the beds is more or less injurious to the\r\ngrowing crop. It is therefore essential that the beds, when made,\r\ncontain the requisite amount of moisture, and that this moisture be not\r\nlost by excessive evaporation. They should be protected from a dry\r\natmosphere or strong draughts. Where watering becomes necessary, it\r\nshould be applied in a fine spray around the beds with a view of\r\nrestoring the moisture to the atmosphere, and on the beds after the\r\nmushrooms have been gathered.\r\n\r\n\r\n=VENTILATION.=--Pure air is essential to a healthy crop. Provision\r\nshould therefore be made for a gradual renewal of the air in the\r\nmushroom house. However, draughts must be avoided as tending to a too\r\nrapid evaporation and cooling of the beds, an unfortunate condition\r\nwhich cannot thereafter be entirely remedied.\r\n\r\n\r\n=THE BEDS.=--The most common type of beds is known as the \"flat bed.\" It\r\nis made on the floor or on shelves as shown in the illustrations. It is\r\nusually about 10 inches deep. Another type, principally used in France,\r\nis known as the \"ridge bed,\" and requires more labor than the flat bed.\r\nThe mushroom house and shelves, if used, should be frequently\r\ndisinfected and whitewashed in order to avoid danger from insects and\r\nbacteria. The preparation of the beds and subsequent operations will be\r\nshown in connection with the other subjects.\r\n\r\n\r\n=PREPARATION OF THE MANURE.=--The best manure is obtained from horses\r\nfed with an abundance of dry and nitrogenous food. The manure of animals\r\nfed on greens is undesirable. Growers do not all follow the same method\r\nof fermenting or composting the manure. When first unloaded, the manure\r\nis left in its original state for a few days. It is then piled in heaps\r\nabout three feet deep and well pressed down. In this operation the\r\nmaterial should be carefully forked and well mixed, and wherever found\r\ntoo dry, it should be lightly sprinkled. It is allowed to remain in that\r\ncondition for about six days when it is again well forked and turned. In\r\nthe latter operation it receives an additional light sprinkling; the dry\r\nportions are turned inside in order that the whole mass may be\r\nhomogenous and uniformly moist, and the heap is again raised to about\r\nthree feet. About six days later the operation is repeated, and in about\r\nthree days the manure should be ready for the beds. It is then of a dark\r\nbrown color mixed with white, free from objectionable odor. It is\r\nunctuous, elastic and moist, though not wet, and should not leave any\r\nmoisture in the hand.\r\n\r\nOf course, the above rules are subject to modification according to the\r\ncondition of the manure, its age and previous handling.\r\n\r\n\r\n=SPAWNING.=--The manure, having been properly composted, is spread\r\nevenly on the floor or shelves and firmly compressed in beds about ten\r\ninches in depth. The temperature of the bed is then too high for\r\nspawning and will usually rise still higher. It should be carefully\r\nwatched with the aid of a special or mushroom thermometer. When the\r\ntemperature of the beds has fallen to about 75° or 80°, they may be\r\nspawned. The beds must be spawned when the temperature falls, never when\r\nit rises. The bricks of spawn are broken into eight or ten pieces, and\r\nthese pieces are inserted from one to two inches below the surface,\r\nabout nine to twelve inches apart. The bed is then firmly compressed. An\r\nadvantage is found in breaking and distributing the spawn over the\r\nsurface of the bed a few days before spawning; this allows the mycelium\r\nto absorb some moisture and swell to some extent. If the bed is in\r\nproper condition it should not require watering for several weeks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 501.--Brick Spawn, Pure Culture.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=CASING THE BEDS.=--As soon as the spawn is observed to \"run,\" or from\r\neight days to two weeks, the beds are \"cased\" or covered with a layer of\r\nabout one inch of light garden loam, well screened. The loam should be\r\nslightly moist, and free from organic matter. The beds should now be\r\nwatched and should not be allowed to evaporate or dry out.\r\n\r\n\r\n=PICKING.=--Mushrooms should appear in from five to ten weeks after\r\nspawning, and the period of production of a good bed ranges from two to\r\nfour months. In picking the mushrooms an intelligent hand will carefully\r\ntwist it from the soil and fill the hole left in the bed with fresh\r\nsoil. Pieces of roots or stems should never be allowed to remain in the\r\nbeds, otherwise decay might set in and infect the surrounding plants. A\r\ngood mushroom bed will yield a crop of from one-half to two pounds per\r\nsquare foot. Mushrooms should be picked every day or every other day;\r\nthey should not be left after the veils begin to break.\r\n\r\nFor the market the mushrooms are sorted as to size and color, and packed\r\nin one, two or five-pound boxes or baskets. Since they are very\r\nperishable, they must reach the market in the shortest time.\r\n\r\n\r\n=OLD BEDS.=--It is not practicable to raise another crop of mushrooms in\r\nthe material of an old bed, although this material is still valuable for\r\ngarden purposes. The old material should be entirely removed, and the\r\nmushroom house thoroughly cleaned before the new beds are made. If this\r\nprecaution be omitted the next crop may suffer from the diseases or\r\nenemies of the mushrooms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 502.--A Cluster of 50 Mushrooms on One Root, Grown\r\nfrom \"Lambert's Pure Culture Spawn\" of the American Spawn Co., St. Paul,\r\nMinn.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=SPAWN.=--The cultivated mushroom is propagated from \"spawn,\" the\r\ncommercial name applied to the mycelium; the term \"spawn\" includes both\r\nthe mycelium and the medium in which it is carried and preserved. Spawn\r\nmay be procured in the market in two forms, flake spawn and brick\r\nspawn. In both forms the mycelium growth is started on a prepared medium\r\nmainly consisting of manure and then arrested and dried. The flake spawn\r\nis short-lived by reason of its loose form, in which the mycelium is\r\neasily accessible to the air and destructive bacteria. It deteriorates\r\nrapidly in transportation and storage and can only be used to advantage\r\nwhen fresh. Growers, especially in the United States, have therefore\r\ndiscarded it in favor of brick spawn, which affords more protection to\r\nthe mycelium and can be safely transported and stored for a reasonable\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\nUntil recently the manufacturer of spawn was compelled to rely entirely\r\nupon the caprice of nature for his supply. The only method known\r\nconsisted in gathering the wild spawn wherever nature had deposited it\r\nand running the same into bricks or in loose material, without reference\r\nto variety. Neither the manufacturer nor the grower had any means of\r\nascertaining the probable nature of the crop until the mushrooms\r\nappeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 503.--Agaricus villaticus.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=PURE CULTURE SPAWN.=--The recent discovery of pure culture spawn in\r\nthis country has made possible the selection and improvement of\r\nvarieties of cultivated mushrooms with special reference to their\r\nhardiness, color, size, flavor and prolificness, and the elimination of\r\ninferior or undesirable fungi in the crop. The scope of this article\r\nprecludes a description of the pure culture method of making spawn. It\r\nis now used by the large commercial growers and has in many sections\r\nentirely superseded the old English spawn and other forms of wild spawn.\r\nAs now manufactured it resembles much in appearance the old English\r\nspawn (see Figure 501). Some remarkable results have been obtained by\r\nthe use of pure culture spawn. We illustrate a cluster of fifty\r\nmushrooms on one root grown by Messrs. Miller & Rogers, of Mortonville,\r\nPa., from \"Lambert's Pure Culture Spawn\" produced by the American Spawn\r\nCompany, of St. Paul, Minn. (Figure 502). Several promising varieties\r\nhave already been developed by the new method, and can now be reproduced\r\nat will. Figure 503 is a good illustration of _Agaricus villaticus_, a\r\nfleshy species in good demand. Figure 504 shows a bed of mushrooms grown\r\nfrom pure culture spawn in a sand rock cave, using the flat bed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 504.--A Mushroom Cave, Showing One of the Test\r\nBeds of the American Spawn Co., St. Paul, Minn.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=HOW TO COOK MUSHROOMS.=--To the true epicure there are but four ways of\r\ncooking mushrooms--broiling, roasting, frying them in sweet butter and\r\nstewing them in cream.\r\n\r\nIn preparing fresh mushrooms for cooking, wash them as little as\r\npossible, as washing robs them of their delicate flavor. Always bear in\r\nmind that the more simply mushrooms are cooked the better they are. Like\r\nall delicately flavored foods, they are spoiled by the addition of\r\nstrongly flavored condiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Broiled Mushrooms.=--Select fine, large flat mushrooms, and be sure\r\nthat they are fresh. If they are dusty just dip them in cold salt water.\r\nThen lay on cheese cloth and let them drain thoroughly. When they are\r\ndry cut off the stem quite close to the comb. Or, what is better,\r\ncarefully break off the stem. Do not throw away the stems. Save them for\r\nstewing, for soup or for mushroom sauce. Having cut or broken off the\r\nstems, take a sharp silver knife and skin the mushrooms, commencing at\r\nthe edge and finishing at the top. Put them on a gridiron that has been\r\nwell rubbed with sweet butter. Lay the mushrooms on the broiling iron\r\nwith the combs upward. Put a small quantity of butter, a little salt and\r\npepper in the center of each comb from where the stem has been removed\r\nand let the mushrooms remain over the fire until the butter melts. Then\r\nserve them on thin slices of buttered and well browned toast, which\r\nshould be cut round or diamond shape.\r\n\r\nServe the mushrooms just as quickly as possible after they are broiled,\r\nas they must be eaten when hot. So nourishing are broiled mushrooms that\r\nwith a light salad they form a sufficient luncheon for anyone.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fried Mushrooms.=--Clean and prepare the mushrooms as for broiling. Put\r\nsome sweet, unsalted butter in a frying pan--enough to swim the\r\nmushrooms in. Stand the frying pan on a quick fire, and when the butter\r\nis at boiling heat carefully drop the mushrooms in and let them fry\r\nthree minutes, and serve them on thin slices of buttered toast.\r\n\r\nServe a sauce of lemon juice, a little melted butter, salt and red\r\npepper with fried mushrooms.\r\n\r\n=Stewed Mushrooms.=--Stewed mushrooms after the following recipe make\r\none of the most delicious of breakfast dishes: It is not necessary to\r\nuse large mushrooms for stewing--small button ones will do. Take the\r\nmushrooms left in the basket after having selected those for broiling,\r\nand also use the stems cut from the mushrooms prepared for boiling.\r\nAfter cleaning and skinning them put them in cold water with a little\r\nvinegar, and let them stand half an hour. If you have a quart of\r\nmushrooms, put a tablespoonful of nice fresh butter in a stewpan and\r\nstand it on the stove. When the butter begins to bubble drop the\r\nmushrooms in the pan, and after they have cooked a minute season them\r\nwell with salt and black pepper. Now take hold of the handle of the\r\nstewpan and, while the mushrooms are gently and slowly cooking, shake\r\nthe pan almost constantly to keep the butter from getting brown and the\r\nmushrooms from sticking. After they have cooked eight minutes pour in\r\nenough rich, sweet cream to cover the mushrooms to the depth of half an\r\ninch, and let them cook about eight or ten minutes longer. Serve them in\r\na very hot vegetable dish. Do not thicken the cream with flour or with\r\nanything. Just cook them in this simple way. You will find them\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Abortive, imperfectly developed.\r\n\r\n  Aberrant, deviating from a type.\r\n\r\n  Acicular, needle-shaped.\r\n\r\n  Aculeate,

Entire plant white.]\r\n\r\nResplendens means shining brightly.\r\n\r\nThe pileus is fleshy, convex, then nearly plane, even, bare, viscid,\r\nwhite, sometimes hyaline-spotted or yellowish on the disk, shining when\r\ndry, margin straight. Flesh white, taste mild, odor pleasant.\r\n\r\nThe gills are nearly free when young, then emarginate, somewhat crowded,\r\nrather thick, entire, white.\r\n\r\nThe stem is solid, bare, subbulbose, even, white, dry. The spores are\r\n8×4µ.\r\n\r\nThe caps are two to four inches broad; the stem is two to four inches\r\nlong.--_Peck._\r\n\r\nThis is a beautiful plant, entirely white, smell and taste pleasant, and\r\nfound in Poke Hollow and in the woods along Ralston's Run, near\r\nChillicothe.\r\n\r\nThis plant is found very generally over the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX TO GENERA.\r\n\r\n\r\n
