DELAMATER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATISE ON GRAIN STACKING.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nPLACING FOUNDATION.\r\n\r\nIf convenient, make a foundation of rails, by placing three rails about\r\nfour and one-half feet apart and parallel, and then add half or two\r\nthirds the length of a rail to each, and cover by laying rails\r\ncrossways, and finish by laying a large rail or post in the center\r\nlengthways.\r\n\r\nThis will form a foundation large enough for ten or twelve large loads.\r\nIf rails, poles or boards cannot be had for an entire foundation,\r\nendeavor to get something to support the heads of a few center sheaves;\r\nfor if sheaves are set on end to commence a stack, the middle is apt to\r\nsettle too much.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMENCING TO BUILD.\r\n\r\nOn the rail foundation, lay around the center in the form of an ellipse,\r\nwith the heads lapping well across the center rail; lap half and\r\ncontinue to lay towards the outside until foundation is covered. Now\r\ncommence at the outside and lay a course around, neither laying out or\r\ndrawing in, except to correct any little error that may occur in the\r\nelliptical form of the stack; complete the courses to the center, but\r\ndon't fill the middle too full; if the outside is lower than the middle,\r\nlay a double course around outside; keep your stack _flat_--full as high\r\nat outside as center; build the first load straight up, neither laying\r\nout or drawing in, if the stack is to contain ten or twelve loads; if\r\neight or nine, lay the last course out a little.\r\n\r\n\r\nLAYING OUT.\r\n\r\nIf the stack is flat and as near an ellipse as the eye can judge,\r\nlaying out and keeping the stack properly balanced will be very easy.\r\nDrive alternate loads on opposite sides of the stack: this will help to\r\nkeep the stack properly balanced. If the eye detects a place that seems\r\nto be lower than the general level, it will be found that it was caused\r\nby laying out more there than at other points; to remedy this defect,\r\ndraw in the next outside course at the low point six, eight or ten\r\ninches, according to the depression. The greater the depression, the\r\nmore it should be drawn in, and the next inside course at the low point\r\nshould be shoved out nearly to the buts of the outside course, then\r\ncontinue to build as though nothing had happened. If a high place should\r\nbe observed, the next outside course should be laid farther out, and\r\ninside course at this point drawn well in. Glance frequently over the\r\nstack and see if the outside presents the appearance of an ellipse, and\r\nkeep a sharp lookout for high and low spots. If the middle is too full,\r\nthe outside will slip out, and an undesirable job of propping will\r\nbegin. Put in two thirds of what is intended for the stack before\r\ncommencing to draw in. Don't let a stack stand over night at this stage\r\nif it can be avoided, but put on the next two loads as quickly as\r\npossible, for the outside of the stack will settle rapidly.\r\n\r\n\r\nFILLING THE MIDDLE.\r\n\r\nLay a tier of bundles through the center half the length of the stack,\r\nalternating heads and buts, then lay a course around with the heads\r\nlapping across the middle tier; now another tier through the center, and\r\ntwo courses around it; then another tier at center and courses around,\r\nuntil the center is three or four feet higher than the outside of the\r\nstack, and the last course layed laps half way from head to band on the\r\noutside course of the stack. It will be seen that while building the\r\nmain part of the stack, the courses were laid from outside to center,\r\nand while filling the middle or putting in the stuffing, the courses are\r\nlaid from center towards outside. Now commence outside, lay a course,\r\nheads out, half way from band to but on outside course, then turn buts\r\nout, lap half and lay to center; then lay a course around outside,\r\nneither laying out or drawing in.\r\n\r\nNow comes a point that should not be overlooked: Lay a course, buts\r\nout, lapping half way from heads to band on outside course; then lap\r\nhalf and lay to center.\r\n\r\nThe reason for laying the buts of second course half way from heads to\r\nband is to give the buts of the next outside course above a chance to\r\nrest firmly on the course below, leaving no unoccupied space; if the\r\nbuts of second course were laid out to the band of outside course, then\r\nthe next outside course above, being drawn in, would rest one-third of\r\nthe way from band to but, on the buts of the course below, leaving a\r\nspace for rain to drive in and wet the stack. Draw in outside course\r\nrapidly; lay buts of second course half way from head to band on outside\r\ncourse as long as stack top is large enough; keep middle well piled up.\r\n\r\nA stack can be drawn in very rapidly, without danger of taking in water\r\nfrom a protracted rain, even if the outside of the stack grows green, no\r\nsheaf will be found wet above the band, and the middle of stack dry, for\r\nthe buts of outside course will form a thatch roof to protect the stack.\r\n\r\nThe placing of a few top bundles is a matter of small importance. If a\r\nstack has been properly built it will receive but little injury if top\r\nbundles should blow off. A strand or two of wire, with sticks or stones\r\nat the ends to weight them down, will usually hold the top in place.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECAPITULATION.\r\n\r\nThe first load being built straight up and flat on top forms a firm and\r\nsecure base on which to build the upper structure.\r\n\r\nLaying out or putting in the bulge is the most important part of the\r\nstack, for it contains the greater part of the grain; by laying out and\r\nkeeping the stack _flat_, the work can be done rapidly, and when the\r\nstack settles the buts will hang down, for there is nothing to hold them\r\nup.\r\n\r\nFilling the middle corresponds to putting rafters on a building to\r\nsupport the roof.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS.\r\n\r\nI have found in the course of a long experience, that a foundation\r\neleven or twelve feet wide and eighteen or twenty feet long, and a stack\r\nbuilt in the form of an ellipse, and so as to contain ten or twelve\r\nlarge loads, to be the most convenient and economical. Grain can be put\r\ninto a stack of this size much more rapidly than in small stacks. If a\r\nstack is built much larger it will require more labor to pass the\r\nbundles across the stack, and will have to be carried much higher before\r\nit is topped out, which takes time and hard work.\r\n\r\nThe elliptical form I have found the best; with a load driven to the\r\nside of the stack, the pitcher is never very far from the stacker; the\r\nstack is easily kept balanced, and at threshing time the grain is\r\nreadily got to the machine. In a round stack of the same size, the\r\nstacker gets farther away from the pitcher, and it requires more skill\r\nto keep a round stack properly balanced; but if a round stack, after it\r\nis finished and settled, looks like an egg standing erect on the large\r\nend, that is good enough; it will not take water, and looks well, too. A\r\nsquare stack, or one with corners, is easily kept balanced, but in\r\nturning the corners there is too much fullness at the heads of the\r\nbundles, and when the stack settles there will usually be a sag on each\r\nside to catch water.\r\n\r\nTwo stakes, one eight and the other ten rods away, and in line with the\r\ncenter of foundation, will sometimes assist the stacker in keeping his\r\nstack well balanced, for at a glance he can tell whether the center is\r\nin line with the stakes. A man may build, as his fancy dictates, either\r\nround, elliptical or square, but in _all_, the same general principles\r\n_must_ be observed--the lower part of the stack built straight up; put\r\nin a bulge which settles down around and nearly conceals the lower part,\r\nleaving the center of the bulge high; filling the middle to support the\r\ncenter of the top. These are the principles on which good stacking\r\ndepends. If a man gets them well fixed in his mind and discards the idea\r\nthat he must keep the middle full from the ground up, he will have but\r\nlittle damaged grain, even in the very worst of seasons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA boy to hand bundles is usually more damage than good until a stack is\r\nhalf built, and then he should not be allowed to stand on outside\r\ncourse. If practical, drive alternate loads on opposite sides of the\r\nstack; this is very desirable, but if, from the nature of surroundings,\r\nit is necessary to drive all on one side, draw the top of the stack over\r\na foot or two towards the side where the unloading is done; the\r\nopposite side will settle considerably the most, which will leave the\r\nstack straight up.\r\n\r\n\r\nFANCY STACKING.\r\n\r\nFor a pyramid stack, build as usual up to within two or three rounds of\r\nwhere drawing in commences, then draw in a little at center of sides and\r\nends to bring the curves to straight lines; keep the corners well out,\r\nobserving the form of a rectangle in filling the middle, and finish to\r\ntop.\r\n\r\nFor a gothic stack, build an ordinary one until commencing to draw in,\r\nthen draw in the oval corners and build center of sides and ends\r\nstraight up. For an X stack draw in sides and ends; build center\r\nstraight up. These stacks look very ornamental on a premium farm and\r\nwill save well, but take more time to build than ordinary stack tops.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAMPLE STACK.\r\n\r\nWith some, the idea seems to prevail, that the middle of the stack\r\nshould be kept full from the ground up. With the center high enough to\r\nprotect the stack after it is settled, it is impossible to lay out or\r\neven build straight up, for the outside sheaves are constantly slipping\r\nout, and the process of building rendered slow and tiresome, and when\r\nthe stack is completed and settled, it will usually be found that the\r\ncenter has gone down so much and the outside so little, that the butts\r\nof the sheaves stick up and form excellent conductors to wet the stack.\r\n\r\nUsually at harvest the country is full of good stackers, and if, between\r\nthat time and threshing, there is little or no rain, they live through\r\nand there is a good supply next year; but if, between stacking and\r\nthreshing, a protracted rain occurs, vast multitudes are drowned, so\r\nthat, at threshing time, but few good stackers are found alive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's A Treatise on Grain Stacking, by John DeLamater",
