A WOMAN!\r\n  ACT I. SCENE III.\r\n  PAINTED BY HOWARD. PUBLISHD BY LONGMAN & CO. ENGRAVD BY HEATH.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINKLE AND YARICO; AN OPERA, IN THREE ACTS;\r\n\r\n  AS PERFORMED AT THE THEATRES ROYAL\r\n  COVENT GARDEN, AND HAYMARKET.\r\n\r\nBY\r\n\r\nGEORGE COLMAN, THE YOUNGER;\r\n\r\n  PRINTED, UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE MANAGERS,\r\n  FROM THE PROMPT BOOK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH REMARKS BY MRS. INCHBALD.\r\n\r\n  LONDON:\r\n  PRINTED FOR LONGMAN, HURST, REES, AND ORME, PATERNOSTER ROW.\r\n\r\n\r\n  T. Davison, Whitefriars,\r\n  London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is a drama, which might remove from Mr. Wilberforce his aversion\r\nto theatrical exhibitions, and convince him, that the teaching of moral\r\nduty is not confined to particular spots of ground; for, in those\r\nplaces, of all others, the doctrine is most effectually inculcated,\r\nwhere exhortation is the most required--the resorts of the gay, the\r\nidle, and the dissipated.\r\n\r\nThis opera was written, when the author was very young; and, should\r\nhe live to be very old, he will have reason to be proud of it to his\r\nlatest day--for it is one of those plays which is independent of time,\r\nof place, or of circumstance, for its value. It was popular before the\r\nsubject of the abolition of the slave trade was popular. It has the\r\npeculiar honour of preceding that great question. It was the bright\r\nforerunner of alleviation to the hardships of slavery.\r\n\r\nThe trivial faults of this opera are--too much play on words (as it is\r\ncalled) by Trudge; and some classical allusions by other characters,\r\nin whose education such knowledge could not be an ingredient.\r\n\r\nA fault more important, is--that the scene at the commencement of the\r\nopera, instead of Africa, is placed in America. It would undoubtedly\r\nhave been a quick passage, to have crossed a fourth part of the\r\nwestern globe, during the interval between the first and second acts;\r\nstill, as the hero and heroine of the drama were compelled to go to\r\nsea--imagination, with but little more exertion, might have given them\r\na fair wind as well from the coast whence slaves are _really_ brought,\r\nas from a shore where no such traffic is held[1].\r\n\r\nAs an opera, Inkle and Yarico has the singular merit not to be\r\nprotected, though aided, by the power of music: the characters are so\r\nforcibly drawn, that even those performers who sing, and study that\r\nart alone, can render every part effectual: and singers and actors of\r\nfuture times, like those of the past, and of the present, will find\r\nevery character exactly suited to their talents.\r\n\r\nThis opera has been performed in every London theatre, and in every\r\ntheatre of the kingdom, with the same degree of splendid success. It\r\nwould have been wonderful had its reception been otherwise; for the\r\nsubject is a most interesting one, and in the treatment of it, the\r\nauthor has shewn taste, judgment--virtue.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: No doubt the author would have ingenuity to argue away\r\nthis objection--but that, which requires argument for its support in a\r\ndramatic work, is a subject for complaint. As slaves are imported from\r\nAfrica, and never from America, the audience, in the two last acts of\r\nthis play, feel as if they had been in the wrong quarter of the globe\r\nduring the first act. Inkle could certainly steal a native from\r\nAmerica, and sell her in Barbadoes, but this is not so consonant with\r\nthat nice imitation of the order of things as to rank above criticism.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERSONS REPRESENTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOVENT GARDEN.\r\n\r\n  INKLE                            _Mr. Johnstone._\r\n  SIR CHRISTOPHER CURRY            _Mr. Quick._\r\n  CAMPLEY                          _Mr. Davies._\r\n  MEDIUM                           _Mr. Wewitzer._\r\n  TRUDGE                           _Mr. Edwin._\r\n  MATE                             _Mr. Darley._\r\n\r\n  YARICO                           _Mrs. Billington._\r\n  NARCISSA                         _Mrs. Mountain._\r\n  WOWSKI                           _Mrs. Martyr._\r\n  PATTY                            _Mrs. Rock._\r\n\r\n\r\nHAYMARKET.\r\n\r\n  INKLE                            _Mr. Bannister, jun._\r\n  SIR CHRISTOPHER CURRY            _Mr. Parsons._\r\n  MEDIUM                           _Mr. Baddeley._\r\n  CAMPLEY                          _Mr. Davies._\r\n  TRUDGE                           _Mr. Edwin._\r\n  MATE                             _Mr. Meadows._\r\n\r\n  YARICO                           _Mrs. Kemble._\r\n  NARCISSA                         _Mrs. Bannister._\r\n  WOWSKI                           _Miss George._\r\n  PATTY                            _Mrs. Forster._\r\n\r\n\r\n_SCENE,--First on the Main of America: Afterwards in Barbadoes._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINKLE AND YARICO.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT THE FIRST.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE I.\r\n\r\n    _An American Forest._\r\n\r\n_Medium._ [_Without._] Hilli ho! ho!\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ [_Without._] Hip! hollo! ho!--Hip!----\r\n\r\n_Enter MEDIUM and TRUDGE._\r\n\r\n_Med._ Pshaw! it's only wasting time and breath. Bawling won't persuade\r\nhim to budge a bit faster, and, whatever weight it may have in _some_\r\nplaces, bawling, it seems, don't go for argument here. Plague on't! we\r\nare now in the wilds of America.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Hip, hillio--ho--hi!----\r\n\r\n_Med._ Hold your tongue, you blockhead, or----\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Lord! sir, if my master makes no more haste, we shall all be\r\nput to sword by the knives of the natives. I'm told they take off heads\r\nlike hats, and hang 'em on pegs, in their parlours. Mercy on us! My\r\nhead aches with the very thoughts of it. Hollo! Mr. Inkle! master;\r\nhollo!\r\n\r\n_Med._ [_Stops his mouth._] Head aches! Zounds, so does mine, with your\r\nconfounded bawling. It's enough to bring all the natives about us; and\r\nwe shall be stripped and plundered in a minute.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Aye; stripping is the first thing that would happen to us;\r\nfor they seem to be woefully off for a wardrobe. I myself saw three, at\r\na distance, with less clothes than I have, when I get out of bed: all\r\ndancing about in black buff; just like Adam in mourning.\r\n\r\n_Med._ This is to have to do with a schemer! a fellow who risks his\r\nlife, for a chance of advancing his interest.--Always advantage in\r\nview! Trying, here, to make discoveries, that may promote his profit in\r\nEngland. Another Botany Bay scheme, mayhap. Nothing else could induce\r\nhim to quit our foraging party, from the ship; when he knows every\r\ninhabitant here is not only as black as a pepper-corn, but as hot into\r\nthe bargain--and _I_, like a fool, to follow him! and then to let him\r\nloiter behind.--Why, nephew;--Why, Inkle.--[_Calling._]\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Why, Inkle----Well! only to see the difference of men! he'd\r\nhave thought it very hard, now, if I had let him call so often after\r\nme. Ah! I wish he was calling after me now, in the old jog-trot way,\r\nagain. What a fool was I to leave London for foreign parts!----That\r\never I should leave Threadneedle-street, to thread an American forest,\r\nwhere a man's as soon lost as a needle in a bottle of hay!\r\n\r\n_Med._ Patience, Trudge! Patience! If we once recover the ship----\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Lord, sir, I shall never recover what I have lost in coming\r\nabroad. When my master and I were in London, I had such a mortal snug\r\nbirth of it! Why, I was _factotum_.\r\n\r\n_Med._ Factotum to a young merchant is no such sinecure, neither.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ But then the honour of it. Think of that, sir; to be clerk as\r\nwell as _own man_. Only consider. You find very few city clerks made\r\nout of a man, now-a-days. To be king of the counting-house, as well\r\nas lord of the bed-chamber. Ah! if I had him but now in the little\r\ndressing-room behind the office; tying his hair, with a bit of red\r\ntape, as usual.\r\n\r\n_Med._ Yes, or writing an invoice in lampblack, and shining his shoes\r\nwith an ink-bottle, _as usual_, you blundering blockhead!\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Oh, if I was but brushing the accounts or casting up the\r\ncoats! mercy on us! what's that?\r\n\r\n_Med._ That! What?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Didn't you hear a noise?\r\n\r\n_Med._ Y--es--but--hush! Oh, heavens be praised! here he is at last.\r\n\r\n_Enter INKLE._\r\n\r\nNow, nephew!\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ So, Mr. Medium.\r\n\r\n_Med._ Zounds, one would think, by your confounded composure, that you\r\nwere walking in St. James's Park, instead of an American forest: and\r\nthat all the beasts were nothing but good company. The hollow trees,\r\nhere, sentry boxes, and the lions in 'em, soldiers; the jackalls,\r\ncourtiers; the crocodiles, fine women; and the baboons, beaus. What the\r\nplague made you loiter so long?\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Reflection.\r\n\r\n_Med._ So I should think; reflection generally comes lagging behind.\r\nWhat, scheming, I suppose; never quiet. At it again, eh? What a happy\r\ntrader is your father, to have so prudent a son for a partner! Why, you\r\nare the carefullest Co. in the whole city. Never losing sight of the\r\nmain chance; and that's the reason, perhaps, you lost sight of us,\r\nhere, on the main of America.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Right, Mr. Medium. Arithmetic, I own, has been the means of\r\nour parting at present.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Ha! A sum in division, I reckon.\r\n\r\n                                                              [_Aside._\r\n\r\n_Med._ And pray, if I may be so bold, what mighty\r\nscheme has just tempted you to employ your head,\r\nwhen you ought to make use of your heels?\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ My heels! Here's pretty doctrine! Do you think I travel merely\r\nfor motion? What, would you have a man of business come abroad, scamper\r\nextravagantly here and there and every where, then return home, and\r\nhave nothing to tell, but that he has _been_ here and there and every\r\nwhere? 'Sdeath, sir, would you have me travel like a lord?\r\n\r\n_Med._ No, the Lord forbid!\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Travelling, uncle, was always intended for improvement; and\r\nimprovement is an advantage; and advantage is profit, and profit is\r\ngain. Which in the travelling translation of a trader, means, that you\r\nshould gain every advantage of improving your profit. I have been\r\ncomparing the land, here, with that of our own country.\r\n\r\n_Med._ And you find it like a good deal of the land of our own\r\ncountry----cursedly encumbered with black legs, I take it.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ And calculating how much it might be made to produce by the\r\nacre.\r\n\r\n_Med._ You were?\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Yes; I was proceeding algebraically upon the subject.\r\n\r\n_Med._ Indeed!\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ And just about extracting the square root.\r\n\r\n_Med._ Hum!\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ I was thinking too, if so many natives could be caught, how\r\nmuch they might fetch at the West Indian markets.\r\n\r\n_Med._ Now let me ask you a question, or two, young cannibal catcher,\r\nif you please.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Well.\r\n\r\n_Med._ Ar'n't we bound for Barbadoes; partly to trade, but chiefly to\r\ncarry home the daughter of the governor, Sir Christopher Curry, who has\r\ntill now been under your father's care, in Threadneedle-street, for\r\npolite English education?\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Granted.\r\n\r\n_Med._ And isn't it determined, between the old folks, that you are to\r\nmarry Narcissa, as soon as we get there?\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ A fixed thing.\r\n\r\n_Med._ Then what the devil do you do here, hunting old hairy negroes,\r\nwhen you ought to be obliging a fine girl in the ship? Algebra, too!\r\nYou'll have other things to think of when you are married, I promise\r\nyou. A plodding fellow's head, in the hands of a young wife, like a\r\nboy's slate, after school, soon gets all its arithmetic wiped off: and\r\nthen it appears in its true simple state: dark, empty, and bound in\r\nwood, Master Inkle.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Not in a match of this kind. Why, it's a table of interest\r\nfrom beginning to end, old Medium.\r\n\r\n_Med._ Well, well, this is no time to talk. Who knows but, instead of\r\nsailing to a wedding, we may get cut up, here, for a wedding dinner:\r\ntossed up for a dingy duke, perhaps, or stewed down for a black\r\nbaronet, or eat raw by an inky commoner?\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Why sure you ar'n't afraid?\r\n\r\n_Med._ Who, I afraid? Ha! ha! ha! No, not I! What the deuce should I\r\nbe afraid of? Thank Heaven I have a clear conscience, and need not be\r\nafraid of any thing. A scoundrel might not be quite so easy on such\r\nan occasion; but it's the part of an honest man not to behave like a\r\nscoundrel: I never behaved like a scoundrel--for which reason I am an\r\nhonest man, you know. But come--I hate to boast of my good qualities.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Slow and sure, my good, virtuous Mr. Medium! Our companions\r\ncan be but half a mile before us: and, if we do but double their steps,\r\nwe shall overtake 'em at one mile's end, by all the powers of arithmetic.\r\n\r\n_Med._ Oh curse your arithmetic!\r\n\r\n                                                             [_Exeunt._\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II.\r\n\r\n    _Another part of the Forest.--A ship at anchor in the bay at\r\n    a small distance.--Mouth of a cave._\r\n\r\n_Enter SAILORS and MATE, as returning from foraging._\r\n\r\n_Mate._ Come, come, bear a hand, my lads. Tho'f the bay is just under\r\nour bowsprits, it will take a damned deal of tripping to come at\r\nit--there's hardly any steering clear of the rocks here. But do we\r\nmuster all hands? All right, think ye?\r\n\r\n_1st. Sail._ All to a man----besides yourself, and a monkey----the\r\nthree land lubbers, that edged away in the morning, goes for nothing,\r\nyou know--they're all dead, may-hap, by this.\r\n\r\n_Mate._ Dead! you be--Why they're friends of the captain; and if not\r\nbrought safe aboard to-night, you may all chance to have a salt eel for\r\nyour supper--that's all--Moreover the young plodding spark, he with the\r\ngrave, foul weather face, there, is to man the tight little frigate,\r\nMiss Narcissa--what d'ye call her? that is bound with us for Barbadoes.\r\nRot'em for not keeping under weigh, I say! But come, let's see if a\r\nsong will bring 'em too. Let's have a full chorus to the good merchant\r\nship, the Achilles, that's wrote by our captain.\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG.\r\n\r\n  _The Achilles, though christen'd, good ship, 'tis surmis'd,_\r\n  _From that old man of war, great Achilles, so priz'd,_\r\n  _Was he, like our vessel, pray fairly baptiz'd?_\r\n                                             _Ti tol lol, &c._\r\n\r\n  _Poets sung_ that _Achilles--if, now, they've an itch_\r\n  _To sing_ this, _future ages may know which is which;_\r\n  _And that one rode in Greece--and the other in pitch._\r\n                                             _Ti tol lol, &c._\r\n\r\n  _What tho' but a merchant ship--sure our supplies:_\r\n  _Now your men of war's gain in a lottery lies,_\r\n  _And how blank they all look, when they can't get a prize!_\r\n                                             _Ti tol lol, &c._\r\n\r\n  _What are all their fine names? when no rhino's behind,_\r\n  _The Intrepid, and Lion, look sheepish you'll find;_\r\n  _Whilst, alas! the poor Æolus can't raise the wind!_\r\n                                             _Ti tol lol, &c._\r\n\r\n  _Then the Thunderer's dumb; out of tune the Orpheus;_\r\n  _The Ceres has nothing at all to produce;_\r\n  _And the Eagle I warrant you, looks like a goose._\r\n                                             _Ti tol lol, &c._\r\n\r\n_1st. Sail._ Avast! look a-head there. Here they come, chased by a\r\nfleet of black devils.\r\n\r\n_Midsh._ And the devil a _fire_ have I to give them. We han't a grain\r\nof powder left. What must we do, lads?\r\n\r\n_2d. Sail._ Do? Sheer off to be sure.\r\n\r\n_Midsh._ [_Reluctantly._] Well, if I must, I must. [_Going to the other\r\nside, and holloing to INKLE, &c._] Yoho, lubbers! Crowd all the sail\r\nyou can, d'ye mind me!\r\n\r\n                                                     [_Exeunt_ SAILORS.\r\n\r\n_Enter MEDIUM, running across the stage, as pursued by the Blacks._\r\n\r\n_Med._ Nephew! Trudge! run--scamper! Scour--fly! Zounds, what harm did\r\nI ever do to be hunted to death by a pack of bloodhounds? Why nephew!\r\nOh, confound your long sums in arithmetic! I'll take care of myself;\r\nand if we must have any arithmetic, dot and carry one for my money.\r\n\r\n                                                           [_Runs off._\r\n\r\n_Enter INKLE and TRUDGE, hastily._\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Oh! that ever I was born, to leave pen, ink, and powder for\r\nthis!\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Trudge, how far are the sailors before us?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ I'll run and see, sir, directly.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Blockhead, come here. The savages are close upon us; we shall\r\nscarce be able to recover our party. Get behind this tuft of trees with\r\nme; they'll pass us, and we may then recover our ship with safety.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ [_Going behind._] Oh! Threadneedle-street, Thread--\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Peace.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ [_Hiding._]--Needle-street. [_They hide behind trees. Natives\r\ncross. After a long pause, INKLE looks from the trees._]\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Trudge.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Sir. [_In a whisper._]\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Are they all gone by?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Won't you look and see?\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ [_Looking round._] So all is safe at last. [_Coming forward._]\r\nNothing like policy in these cases; but you'd have run on, like a booby!\r\nA tree, I fancy, you'll find, in future, the best resource in a hot\r\npursuit.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Oh, charming! It's a retreat for a king, sir: Mr. Medium,\r\nhowever, has not got up in it; your uncle, sir, _has run on like a\r\nbooby_; and has got up with our party by this time, I take it; who are\r\nnow most likely at the shore. But what are we to do next, sir?\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Reconnoitre a little, and then proceed.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Then pray, sir, proceed to reconnoitre; for the sooner the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Then look out, d'ye hear, and tell me if you discover any\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Y----Ye--s--Yes.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Well, is the coast clear?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Eh! Oh lord!--Clear! [_Rubbing his eyes._] Oh dear! oh dear!\r\nthe coast will soon be clear enough now, I promise you----The ship is\r\nunder sail, sir!\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Confusion! my property carried off in the vessel.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ All, all, sir, except me.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ They may report me dead, perhaps, and dispose of my property\r\nat the next island. [_The vessel appears under sail._]\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Ah! there they go. [_A gun fired._]----That will be the last\r\nreport we shall ever hear from 'em I'm afraid.--That's as much as to\r\nsay, Good bye to ye. And here we are left--two fine, full-grown babes\r\nin the wood!\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ What an ill-timed accident! Just too, when my speedy union\r\nwith Narcissa, at Barbadoes, would so much advance my interests.--Ah,\r\nmy Narcissa, I never shall forget thy last adieu.--Something must be\r\nhit upon, and speedily; but what resource? [_Thinking._]\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ The old one--a tree, sir.--'Tis all we have for it now. What\r\nwould I give, now, to be perched upon a high stool, with our brown\r\ndesk squeezed into the pit of my stomach--scribbling away an old\r\nparchment!----But all my red ink will be spilt by an old black pin of\r\na negro.\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG.\r\n\r\n[Last Valentine's Day.]\r\n\r\n  _A voyage over seas had not entered my head,_\r\n  _Had I known but on which side to butter my bread,_\r\n  _Heigho! sure I--for hunger must die!_\r\n  _I've sail'd like a booby; come here in a squall,_\r\n  _Where, alas! there's no bread to be butter'd at all!_\r\n        _Oho! I'm a terrible booby!_\r\n        _Oh, what a sad booby am I!_\r\n\r\n  _In London, what gay chop-house signs in the street!_\r\n  _But the only sign here is of nothing to eat._\r\n  _Heigho! that I----for hunger should die!_\r\n  _My mutton's all lost; I'm a poor starving elf!_\r\n  _And for all the world like a lost mutton myself._\r\n        _Oho! I shall die a lost mutton!_\r\n        _Oh! what a lost mutton am I!_\r\n\r\n  _For a neat slice of beef, I could roar like a bull;_\r\n  _And my stomach's so empty, my heart is quite full._\r\n  _Heigho! that I--for hunger should die!_\r\n  _But, grave without meat, I must here meet my grave,_\r\n  _For my bacon, I fancy, I never shall save._\r\n        _Oho! I shall ne'er save my bacon!_\r\n        _I can't save my bacon, not I!_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Hum! I was thinking----I was thinking, sir--if so many\r\nnatives could be caught, how much they might fetch at the West India\r\nmarkets!\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Scoundrel! is this a time to jest?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ No, faith, sir! Hunger is too sharp to be jested with. As for\r\nme, I shall starve for want of food. Now you may meet a luckier fate:\r\nyou are able to extract the square root, sir; and that's the very best\r\nprovision you can find here to live upon. But I! [_Noise at a distance._]\r\nMercy on us! here they come again.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Confusion! Deserted on one side, and pressed on the other,\r\nwhich way shall I turn?--This cavern may prove a safe retreat to us for\r\nthe present. I'll enter, cost what it will.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Oh Lord! no, don't, don't----We shall pay too dear for our\r\nlodging, depend on't.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ This is no time for debating. You are at the mouth of it: lead\r\nthe way, Trudge.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ What! go in before your honour! I know my place better, I\r\nassure you--I might walk into more mouths than one, perhaps. [_Aside._]\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Coward! then follow me. [_Noise again._]\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ I must, sir; I must! Ah, Trudge, Trudge! what a damned hole\r\nare you getting into!\r\n\r\n                                               [_Exeunt into a Cavern._\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE III.\r\n\r\n    _A cave, decorated with skins of wild beasts, feathers, &c. In the\r\n    middle of the scene, a rude kind of curtain, by way of door to an\r\n    inner apartment._\r\n\r\n_Enter INKLE and TRUDGE, as from the mouth of the cavern._\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ So far, at least, we have proceeded with safety. Ha! no bad\r\nspecimen of savage elegance. These ornaments would be worth something\r\nin England.--We have little to fear here, I hope: this cave rather\r\nbears the pleasing face of a profitable adventure.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Very likely, sir! But for a pleasing face, it has the\r\ncursed'st ugly month I ever saw in my life. Now do, sir, make off as\r\nfast as you can. If we once get clear of the natives' houses, we have\r\nlittle to fear from the lions and leopards: for by the appearance of\r\ntheir parlours, they seem to have killed all the wild beast in the\r\ncountry. Now pray, do, my good master, take my advice, and run away.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Rascal! Talk again of going out, and I'll flea you alive.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ That's just what I expect for coming in.--All that enter here\r\nappear to have had their skins stript over their ears; and ours will be\r\nkept for curiosities--We shall stand here, stuffed, for a couple of\r\nwhite wonders.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ This curtain seems to lead to another apartment: I'll draw it.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ No, no, no, don't; don't. We may be called to account for\r\ndisturbing the company: you may get a curtain-lecture, perhaps, sir.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Peace, booby, and stand on your guard.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Oh! what will become of us! Some grim, seven foot fellow\r\nready to scalp us.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ By heaven! a woman.\r\n\r\n          [_As the curtain draws, YARICO and WOWSKI discovered asleep._\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ A woman! [_Aside._]--[_Loud._] But let him come on; I'm\r\nready--dam'me, I don't fear facing the devil himself--Faith it is a\r\nwoman--fast asleep too.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ And beautiful as an angel!\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ And egad! there seems to be a nice, little plump bit in the\r\ncorner; only she's an angel of rather a darker sort.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Hush! keep back--she wakes. [_YARICO comes forward--INKLE and\r\nTRUDGE retire to opposite sides of the scene._]\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG.--YARICO.\r\n\r\n  _When the chace of day is done,_\r\n  _And the shaggy lion's skin,_\r\n  _Which for us, our warriors win,_\r\n  _Decks our cells at set of sun;_\r\n  _Worn with toil, with slap opprest,_\r\n  _I press my mossy bed, and sink to rest._\r\n\r\n  _Then, once more, I see our train,_\r\n  _With all our chase renew'd again:_\r\n      _Once more 'tis day,_\r\n      _Once more our prey_\r\n  _Gnashes his angry teeth, and foams in vain._\r\n      _Again, in sullen haste, he flies,_\r\n      _Ta'en in the toil, again he lies,_\r\n  _Again he roars--and, in my slumbers, dies._\r\n\r\n\r\n_INKLE and TRUDGE come forward._\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Our language!\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Zounds, she has thrown me into a cold sweat.\r\n\r\n_Yar._ Hark! I heard a noise! Wowski, awake! whence can it proceed? [_She\r\nawakes WOWSKI, and they both come forward--YARICO towards INKLE_; _WOWSKI\r\ntowards TRUDGE._]\r\n\r\n_Yar._ Ah! what form is this?----are you a man?\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ True flesh and blood, my charming heathen, I promise you.\r\n\r\n_Yar._ What harmony in his voice! What a shape! How fair his skin\r\ntoo----[_Gazing._]\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ This must be a lady of quality, by her staring.\r\n\r\n_Yar._ Say, stranger, whence come you?\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ From a far distant island; driven on this coast by distress,\r\nand deserted by my companions.\r\n\r\n_Yar._ And do you know the danger that surrounds you here? Our woods\r\nare filled with beasts of prey--my countrymen too----(yet, I think they\r\ncou'd'nt find the heart)--might kill you.----It would be a pity if you\r\nfell in their way----I think I should weep if you came to any harm.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ O ho! It's time, I see, to begin making interest with the\r\nchamber maid. [_Takes WOWSKI apart._]\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ How wild and beautiful! sure there is magic in her shape, and\r\nshe has rivetted me to the place. But where shall I look for safety?\r\nlet me fly and avoid my death.\r\n\r\n_Yar._ Oh! no--don't depart.----But I will try to preserve you; and if\r\nyou are killed, Yarico must die too! Yet, 'tis I alone can save you;\r\nyour death is certain, without my assistance; and, indeed, indeed you\r\nshall not want it.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ My kind Yarico! what means, then, must be used for my safety?\r\n\r\n_Yar._ My cave must conceal you: none enter it, since my father was\r\nslain in battle. I will bring you food by day, then lead you to our\r\nunfrequented groves by moonlight, to listen to the nightingale. If you\r\nshould sleep, I'll watch you, and awake you when there's danger.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Generous maid! Then, to you will I owe my life; and whilst it\r\nlasts, nothing shall part us.\r\n\r\n_Yar._ And shan't it, shan't it indeed?\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ No, my Yarico! For when an opportunity offers to return to my\r\ncountry, you shall be my companion.\r\n\r\n_Yar._ What! cross the seas!\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Yes, Help me to discover a vessel, and you shall enjoy\r\nwonders. You shall be decked in silks, my brave maid, and have a house\r\ndrawn with horses to carry you.\r\n\r\n_Yar._ Nay, do not laugh at me--but is it so?\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ It is indeed!\r\n\r\n_Yar._ Oh wonder! I wish my countrywomen could see me----But won't your\r\nwarriors kill us?\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ No, our only danger on land is here.\r\n\r\n_Yar._ Then let us retire further into the cave. Come--your safety is\r\nin my keeping.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ I follow you--Yet, can you run some risk in following me?\r\n\r\n\r\nDUETT.\r\n\r\n[O say, Bonny Lass.]\r\n\r\n  Inkle.  _O say, simple maid, have you form'd any notion_\r\n          _Of all the rude dangers in crossing the ocean?_\r\n          _When winds whistle shrilly, ah! won't they remind you,_\r\n          _To sigh with regret, for the grot left behind you?_\r\n\r\n  Yar.    _Ah! no, I could follow, and sail the world over,_\r\n          _Nor think of my grot, when I look at my lover;_\r\n          _The winds, which blow round us, your arms for my pillow,_\r\n          _Will lull us to sleep, whilst we're rocked by each billow._\r\n\r\n  Both.   _O say then my true love, we never will sunder,_\r\n          _Nor shrink from the tempest, nor dread the big thunder:_\r\n          _Whilst constant, we'll laugh at all changes of weather,_\r\n          _And journey all over the world both together._\r\n\r\n                            [Exeunt; as retiring further into the cave.\r\n\r\n_Manent TRUDGE and WOWSKI._\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Why, you speak English as well as I, my little Wowski.\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Iss.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Iss! and you learnt it from a strange man, that tumbled from\r\na big boat, many moons ago, you say?\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Iss--Teach me--teach good many.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Then, what the devil made them so surprized at seeing us! was\r\nhe like me? [_Wowski shakes her head._] Not so smart a body, mayhap.\r\nWas his face, now, round and comely, and--eh! [_Stroking his chin._]\r\nWas it like mine?\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Like dead leaf--brown and shrivel.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Oh, oh, an old shipwrecked sailor, I warrant. With white and\r\ngrey hair, eh, my pretty beauty spot?\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Iss; all white. When night come, he put it in pocket.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Oh! wore a wig. But the old boy taught you something more\r\nthan English, I believe.\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Iss.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ The devil he did! What was it?\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Teach me put dry grass, red hot, in hollow white stick.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Aye, what was that for?\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Put in my mouth--go poff, poff!\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Zounds! did he teach you to smoke?\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Iss.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ And what became of him at last? What did your countrymen do\r\nfor the poor fellow?\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Eat him one day--Our chief kill him.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Mercy on us! what damned stomachs, to swallow a tough old\r\ntar! Ah, poor Trudge! your killing comes next.\r\n\r\n_Wows._ No, no--not you--no--[_Running to him anxiously._]\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ No? why what shall I do, if I get in their paws?\r\n\r\n_Wows._ I fight for you!\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Will you? Ecod she's a brave good-natured wench! she'll be\r\nworth a hundred of your English wives.--Whenever they fight on their\r\nhusband's account, it's _with_ him instead of _for_ him, I fancy. But\r\nhow the plague am I to live here?\r\n\r\n_Wows._ I feed you--bring you kid.\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG.--WOWSKI.\r\n\r\n[One day, I heard Mary say.]\r\n\r\n  _White man, never go away----_\r\n    _Tell me why need you?_\r\n  _Stay, with your Wowski, stay:_\r\n    _Wowski will feed you._\r\n  _Cold moons are now coming in;_\r\n    _Ah, don't go grieve me!_\r\n  _I'll wrap you in leopard's skin:_\r\n    _White man, don't leave me._\r\n\r\n  _And when all the sky is blue,_\r\n    _Sun makes warm weather,_\r\n  _I'll catch you a cockatoo,_\r\n    _Dress you in feather._\r\n  _When cold comes, or when 'tis hot,_\r\n    _Ah, don't go grieve me!_\r\n  _Poor Wowski will be forgot--_\r\n    _White man, don't leave me!_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Zounds! leopard's skin for winter wear, and feathers for a\r\nsummer's suit! Ha, ha! I shall look like a walking hammer-cloth, at\r\nChristmas, and an upright shuttlecock, in the dog days. And for all\r\nthis, if my master and I find our way to England, you shall be part of\r\nour travelling equipage; and, when I get there, I'll give you a couple\r\nof snug rooms, on a first floor, and visit you every evening, as soon\r\nas I come from the counting-house. Do you like it?\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Iss.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Damme, what a flashy fellow I shall seem in the city! I'll\r\nget her a _white_ boy to bring up the tea-kettle. Then I'll teach you\r\nto write and dress hair.\r\n\r\n_Wows._ You great man in your country?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Oh yes, a very great man. I'm head clerk of the counting-house,\r\nand first valet-de-chambre of the dressing-room. I pounce parchments,\r\npowder hair, black shoes, ink paper, shave beards, and mend pens. But\r\nhold! I had forgot one material point--you ar'n't married, I hope?\r\n\r\n_Wows._ No: you be my chum-chum!\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ So I will. It's best, however, to be sure of her being\r\nsingle; for Indian husbands are not quite so complaisant as English\r\nones, and the vulgar dogs might think of looking a little after their\r\nspouses. But you have had a lover or two in your time; eh, Wowski?\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Oh, iss--great many--I tell you.\r\n\r\n\r\nDUETT.\r\n\r\n  Wows.   _Wampum, Swampum, Yanko, Lanko, Nanko, Pownatowski,_\r\n          _Black men--plenty--twenty--fight for me,_\r\n              _White man, woo you true?_\r\n\r\n  Trudge. _Who?_\r\n\r\n  Wows.          _You._\r\n\r\n  Trudge.               _Yes, pretty little Wowski!_\r\n\r\n  Wows.   _Then I leave all, and follow thee._\r\n\r\n  Trudge. _Oh then turn about, my little tawny tight one!_\r\n              _Don't you like me?_\r\n\r\n  Wows.   _Iss, you're like the snow!_\r\n                        _If you slight one----_\r\n\r\n  Trudge. _Never, not for any white one;_\r\n              _You are beautiful as any sloe._\r\n\r\n  Wows.   _Wars, jars, scars, can't expose ye,_\r\n              _In our grot----_\r\n\r\n  Trudge.                       _So snug and cosey!_\r\n\r\n  Wows.   _Flowers, neatly_\r\n          _Pick'd, shall sweetly_\r\n                                  _Make your bed._\r\n\r\n  Trudge. _Coying, toying,_\r\n                            _With a rosy_\r\n                                          _Posey,_\r\n                                             _When I'm dosey,_\r\n          _Bear-skin nightcaps too shall warm my head._\r\n\r\n  Both.   _Bearskin nightcaps, &c. &c._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT THE SECOND.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE I.\r\n\r\n    _The Quay at Barbadoes, with an Inn upon it. People employed in\r\n    unlading vessels, carrying bales of goods, &c._\r\n\r\n_Enter several PLANTERS._\r\n\r\n_1st Plant._ I saw her this morning, gentlemen, you may depend on't. My\r\ntelescope never fails me. I popp'd upon her as I was taking a peep from\r\nmy balcony. A brave tight ship, I tell you, bearing down directly for\r\nBarbadoes here.\r\n\r\n_2d Plant._ Ods, my life! rare news! We have not had a vessel arrive in\r\nour harbour these six weeks.\r\n\r\n_3d Plant._ And the last brought only Madam Narcissa, our Governor's\r\ndaughter, from England; with a parcel of lazy, idle, white folks about\r\nher. Such cargoes will never do for our trade, neighbour.\r\n\r\n_2d Plant._ No, no; we want slaves. A terrible dearth of 'em in Barbadoes,\r\nlately! But your dingy passengers for my money. Give me a vessel like a\r\ncollier, where all the lading tumbles out as black as my hat. But are you\r\nsure, now, you ar'n't mistaken? [_To 1st Planter._]\r\n\r\n_1st Plant._ Mistaken! 'sbud, do you doubt my glass? I can discover a\r\ngull by it six leagues off: I could see every thing as plain as if I\r\nwas on board.\r\n\r\n_2d Plant._ Indeed! and what were her colours?\r\n\r\n_1st Plant._ Um! why English----or Dutch----or French----I don't\r\nexactly remember.\r\n\r\n_2d Plant._ What were the sailors aboard?\r\n\r\n_1st Plant._ Eh! why they were English too----or Dutch----or\r\nFrench----I can't perfectly recollect.\r\n\r\n_2d Plant._ Your glass, neighbour, is a little like a glass too much:\r\nit makes you forget every thing you ought to remember. [_Cry without_,\r\n\"A sail, a sail!\"]\r\n\r\n_1st Plant._ Egad, but I'm right though. Now, gentlemen!\r\n\r\n_All._ Aye, aye; the devil take the hindmost.\r\n\r\n                                                     [_Exeunt hastily._\r\n\r\n_Enter NARCISSA and PATTY._\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG.\r\n\r\n  _Freshly now the breeze is blowing,_\r\n    _As yon ship at anchor rides;_\r\n  _Sullen waves, incessant flowing,_\r\n    _Rudely dash against the sides._\r\n  _So my heart, its course impéded,_\r\n    _Beats in my perturbed breast;_\r\n  _Doubts, like waves by waves succeeded,_\r\n    _Rise, and still deny it rest._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Well, ma'am, as I was saying----\r\n\r\n_Nar._ Well, say no more of what you were saying--Sure, Patty, you\r\nforget where you are; a little caution will be necessary now, I think.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Lord, madam, how is it possible to help talking? We are in\r\nBarbadoes here, to be sure--but then, ma'am, one may let out a little\r\nin a private morning's walk by ourselves.\r\n\r\n_Nar._ Nay, it's the same thing with you in doors.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ I never blab, ma'am, never, as I hope for a gown.\r\n\r\n_Nar._ And your never blabbing, as you call it, depends chiefly on that\r\nhope, I believe.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ I have told the story of our voyage, indeed, to old Guzzle,\r\nthe butler.\r\n\r\n_Nar._ And thus you lead him to imagine I am but little inclined to the\r\nmatch.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Lord, ma'am, how could that be? Why I never said a word about\r\nCaptain Campley.\r\n\r\n_Nar._ Hush! hush! for heaven's sake.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Aye! there it is now. But if our voyage from England was so\r\npleasant, it wasn't owing to Mr. Inkle, I'm certain. He didn't play the\r\nfiddle in our cabin, and dance on the deck, and come languishing with a\r\nglass of warm water in his hand, when we were sea-sick. Ah, ma'am, that\r\nwater warm'd your heart, I'm confident. Mr. Inkle! No, no; Captain\r\nCam----\r\n\r\n_Nar._ There is no end to this! Remember, Patty, keep your secrecy, or\r\nyou entirely lose my favour.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Never fear me, ma'am. But if somebody I know is not acquainted\r\nwith the Governor, there's such a thing as dancing at balls, and\r\nsqueezing hands when you lead up, and squeezing them again when you\r\ncast down. I'm as close as a patch box. Mum's the word, ma'am, I\r\npromise you.\r\n\r\n                                                               [_Exit._\r\n\r\n_Nar._ How awkward is my present situation! Promised to one, who,\r\nperhaps, may never again be heard of; and who, I am sure, if he ever\r\nappears to claim me, will do it merely on the score of interest--pressed\r\ntoo by another, who has already, I fear, too much interest in my\r\nheart--what can I do? What plan can I follow?\r\n\r\n_Enter CAMPLEY._\r\n\r\n_Camp._ Follow my advice, Narcissa, by all means. Enlist with me under\r\nthe best banners in the world. General Hymen for my money! little\r\nCupid's his drummer: he has been beating a round rub-a-dub on our\r\nhearts, and we have only to obey the word of command, fall into the\r\nranks of matrimony, and march through life together.\r\n\r\n_Nar._ Then consider our situation.\r\n\r\n_Camp._ That has been duly considered. In short, the case stands\r\nexactly thus--your intended spouse is all for money; I am all for love.\r\nHe is a rich rogue; I am rather a poor honest fellow. He would pocket\r\nyour fortune; I will take you without a fortune in your pocket.\r\n\r\n_Nar._ Oh! I am sensible of the favour, most gallant Captain Campley;\r\nand my father, no doubt, will be very much obliged to you.\r\n\r\n_Camp._ Aye, there's the devil of it! Sir Christopher Curry's confounded\r\ngood character knocks me up at once. Yet I am not acquainted with him\r\nneither; not known to him even by sight; being here only as a private\r\ngentleman, on a visit to my old relation, out of regimentals, and so\r\nforth; and not introduced to the Governor, as other officers of the\r\nplace. But then, the report of his hospitality--his odd, blunt, whimsical\r\nfriendship--his whole behaviour--\r\n\r\n_Nar._ All stare you in the face; eh, Campley?\r\n\r\n_Camp._ They do, till they put me out of countenance.\r\n\r\n_Nar._ What signifies talking to _me_, when you have such opposition\r\nfrom others? Why hover about the city, instead of boldly attacking the\r\nguard? Wheel about, captain! face the enemy! March! Charge! Rout\r\n'em!--Drive 'em before you, and then--\r\n\r\n_Camp._ And then--\r\n\r\n_Nar._ Lud ha' mercy on the poor city!\r\n\r\n_Enter PATTY, hastily._\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Oh lud, ma'am, I'm frightened out of my wits! sure as I'm\r\nalive, ma'am, Mr. Inkle is not dead; I saw his man, ma'am, just now,\r\ncoming ashore in a boat, with other passengers, from the vessel that's\r\ncome to the island.\r\n\r\n                                                               [_Exit._\r\n\r\n_Nar._ Then one way or other I must determine.--[_To CAMPLEY._] Look'ye,\r\nMr. Campley, something has happened which makes me wave ceremonies.--If\r\nyou mean to apply to my father, remember, that delays are dangerous.\r\n\r\n_Camp._ Indeed!\r\n\r\n_Nar._ I mayn't be always in the same mind, you know. [_Smiling._]\r\n\r\n                                                               [_Exit._\r\n\r\n_Camp._ Nay, then--Gad, I'm almost afraid too--but living in this state\r\nof doubt is torment. I'll e'en put a good face on the matter; cock my\r\nhat; make my bow; and try to reason the Governor into compliance. Faint\r\nheart never won a fair lady.\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG.\r\n\r\n  _Why should I vain fears discover,_\r\n    _Prove a dying, sighing swain?_\r\n  _Why turn shilly-shally lover,_\r\n    _Only to prolong my pain?_\r\n\r\n  _When we woo the dear enslaver,_\r\n    _Boldly ask, and she will grant;_\r\n  _How should we obtain a favour,_\r\n    _But by telling what we want?_\r\n\r\n\r\n_Enter TRUDGE and WOWSKI, (as from the ship), with a dirty runner to one\r\nof the inns._\r\n\r\n_Run._ This way, sir; if you will let me recommend----\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Come along, Wows! Take care of your furs, and your feathers,\r\nmy girl!\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Iss.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ That's right.--Somebody might steal 'em, perhaps.\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Steal!--What that?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Oh Lord! see what one loses by not being born in a christian\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n_Run._ If you would, sir, but mention to your master, the house that\r\nbelongs to my master; the best accommodations on the quay.--\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ What's your sign, my lad?\r\n\r\n_Run._ The Crown, sir.--Here it is.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Well, get us a room for half an hour, and we'll come: and\r\nharkee! let it be light and airy, d'ye hear? My master has been used to\r\nyour open apartments lately.\r\n\r\n_Run._ Depend on it.--Much obliged to you, sir.\r\n\r\n                                                               [_Exit._\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Who be that fine man? He great prince?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ A prince--Ha! ha!----No, not quite a prince--but he belongs\r\nto the Crown. But how do you like this, Wows? Isn't it fine?\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Wonder!\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Fine men, eh?\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Iss! all white; like you.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Yes, all the fine men are like me. As different from your\r\npeople as powder and ink, or paper and blacking.\r\n\r\n_Wows._ And fine lady--Face like snow.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ What! the fine lady's complexions? Oh, yes, exactly; for too\r\nmuch heat very often dissolves 'em! Then their dress, too.\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Your countrymen dress so?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Better, better a great deal. Why, a young flashy Englishman\r\nwill sometimes carry a whole fortune on his back. But did you mind the\r\nwomen? All here--and there; [_Pointing before and behind._] they have it\r\nall from us in England.--And then the fine things they carry on their\r\nheads, Wowski.\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Iss. One lady carry good fish----so fine, she call every body\r\nto look at her.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Pshaw! an old woman bawling flounders. But the fine girls we\r\nmeet, here, on the quay--so round and so plump!\r\n\r\n_Wows._ You not love me now?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Not love you! Zounds, have not I given you proofs?\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Iss. Great many: but now you get here, you forget poor Wowski!\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Not I. I'll stick to you like wax.\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Ah! I fear! What make you love me now?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Gratitude, to be sure.\r\n\r\n_Wows._ What that?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Ha! this it is, now, to live without education. The poor dull\r\ndevils of her country are all in the practice of gratitude, without\r\nfinding out what it means; while we can tell the meaning of it, with\r\nlittle or no practice at all.--Lord, Lord, what a fine advantage\r\nchristian learning is! Hark'ee, Wows!\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Iss.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Now we've accomplished our landing, I'll accomplish you. You\r\nremember the instructions I gave you on the voyage?\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Iss.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Let's see now--What are you to do, when I introduce you to\r\nthe nobility, gentry, and others--of my acquaintance?\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Make believe sit down; then get up.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Let me see you do it. [_She makes a low courtesy._] Very\r\nwell! and how are you to recommend yourself, when you have nothing to\r\nsay, amongst all our great friends?\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Grin--show my teeth.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Right! they'll think you've lived with people of fashion. But\r\nsuppose you meet an old shabby friend in misfortune, that you don't\r\nwish to be seen speak to--what would you do?\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Look blind--not see him.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Why would you do that?\r\n\r\n_Wows._ 'Cause I can't see good friend in distress.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ That's a good girl! and I wish every body could boast of so\r\nkind a motive for such cursed cruel behaviour.--Lord! how some of your\r\nflashy bankers' clerks have _cut_ me in Threadneedle street.--But come,\r\nthough we have got among fine folks, here, in an English settlement, I\r\nwon't be ashamed of my old acquaintance: yet, for my own part, I should\r\nnot be sorry, now, to see my old friend with a new face.--Odsbobs! I\r\nsee Mr. Inkle--Go in, Wows; call for what you like best.\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Then I call for you--ah! I fear I not see you often now. But\r\nyou come soon----\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG.\r\n\r\n  _Remember when we walked alone,_\r\n    _And heard, so gruff, the lion growl:_\r\n  _And when the moon so bright it shone,_\r\n    _We saw the wolf look up and howl;_\r\n  _I led you well, safe to our cell,_\r\n                  _While tremblingly,_\r\n                  _You said to me,_\r\n  _--And kiss'd so sweet--dear Wowski tell,_\r\n                    _How could I live without ye?_\r\n\r\n  _But now you come across the sea,_\r\n    _And tell me here no monsters roar;_\r\n  _You'll walk alone, and leave poor me,_\r\n    _When wolves, to fright you, howl no more._\r\n  _But ah! think well on our old cell,_\r\n                  _Where tremblingly,_\r\n                  _You kiss'd poor me--_\r\n  _Perhaps you'll say--dear Wowski tell,_\r\n                    _How can I live without ye?_\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                        [_Exit WOWSKI._\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Who have we here?\r\n\r\n_Enter FIRST PLANTER._\r\n\r\n_Plant._ Hark'ee, young man! Is that young Indian of yours going to our\r\nmarket?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Not she--she never went to market in all her life.\r\n\r\n_Plant._ I mean, is she for our sale of slaves? Our black fair?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ A black fair, ha! ha! ha! You hold it on a brown green, I\r\nsuppose.\r\n\r\n_Plant._ She's your slave, I take it?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Yes; and I'm her humble servant, I take it.\r\n\r\n_Plant._ Aye, aye, natural enough at sea.--But at how much do you value\r\nher?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Just as much as she has saved me--My own life.\r\n\r\n_Plant._ Pshaw! you mean to sell her?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ [_Staring._] Zounds! what a devil of a fellow! Sell Wows!--my\r\npoor, dear, dingy, wife!\r\n\r\n_Plant._ Come, come, I've heard your story from the ship.--Don't let's\r\nhaggle; I'll bid as fair as any trader amongst us. But no tricks upon\r\ntravellers, young man, to raise your price.----Your wife, indeed! Why\r\nshe's no christian!\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ No; but I am; so I shall do as I'd be done by: and, if you\r\nwere a good one yourself, you'd know, that fellow-feeling for a poor\r\nbody, who wants your help, is the noblest mark of our religion.--I\r\nwou'dn't be articled clerk to such a fellow for the world.\r\n\r\n_Plant._ Hey-day! the booby's in love with her! Why, sure, friend, you\r\nwould not live here with a black?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Plague on't; there it is. I shall be laughed out of my\r\nhonesty, here.--But you may be jogging, friend; I may feel a little\r\nqueer, perhaps, at showing her face--but, dam me, if ever I do any\r\nthing to make me asham'd of showing my own.\r\n\r\n_Plant._ Why, I tell you, her very complexion----\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Rot her complexion--I'll tell you what, Mr. _Fair-trader_, if\r\nyour head and heart were to change places, I've a notion you'd be as\r\nblack in the face as an ink-bottle.\r\n\r\n_Plant._ Pshaw! the fellow's a fool--a rude rascal--he ought to be sent\r\nback to the savages again. He's not fit to live among us christians.\r\n\r\n                                                       [_Exit PLANTER._\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Oh, here comes my master, at last.\r\n\r\n_Enter INKLE, and a second PLANTER._\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Nay, sir, I understand your customs well; your Indian markets\r\nare not unknown to me.\r\n\r\n_2d Plant._ And, as you seem to understand business, I need not tell\r\nyou, that dispatch is the soul of it. Her name you say is--\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Yarico: but urge this no more, I beg you; I must not listen\r\nto it: for, to speak freely, her anxious care of me demands, that\r\nhere,--though here it may seem strange--I should avow my love for her.\r\n\r\n_Plant._ Lord help you for a merchant!--It's the first time I ever\r\nheard a trader talk of love; except, indeed, the love of trade, and the\r\nlove of the _Sweet Molly_, my ship.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Then, sir, you cannot feel my situation.\r\n\r\n_Plant._ Oh yes, I can! we have a hundred such cases just after a\r\nvoyage; but they never last long on land. It's amazing how constant\r\na young man is in a ship! But, in two words, will you dispose of her,\r\nor no?\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ In two words, then, meet me here at noon, and we'll speak\r\nfurther on this subject: and lest you think I trifle with your\r\nbusiness, hear why I wish this pause. Chance threw me, on my passage to\r\nyour island, among a savage people. Deserted,--defenceless,--cut off\r\nfrom companions,--my life at stake--to this young creature I owe my\r\npreservation;--she found me, like a dying bough, torn from its kindred\r\nbranches; which, as it drooped, she moistened with her tears.\r\n\r\n_Plant._ Nay, nay, talk like a man of this world.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Your patience.--And yet your interruption goes to my present\r\nfeelings; for on our sail to this your island--the thoughts of time\r\nmispent--doubt--fears--for call it what you will--have much perplexed\r\nme; and as your spires arose, reflections still rose with them; for\r\nhere, sir, lie my interests, great connexions, and other weighty\r\nmatters--which now I need not mention----\r\n\r\n_Plant._ But which her presence here will mar.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Even so--And yet the gratitude I owe her--\r\n\r\n_Plant._ Pshaw! So because she preserved your life, your gratitude is\r\nto make you give up all you have to live upon.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Why, in that light indeed--This never struck me yet, I'll\r\nthink on't.\r\n\r\n_Plant._ Aye, aye, do so--Why, what return can the wench wish more than\r\ntaking her from a wild, idle, savage people, and providing for her,\r\nhere, with reputable hard work, in a genteel, polished, tender,\r\nchristian country?\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Well, sir, at noon----\r\n\r\n_Plant._ I'll meet you--but remember, young gentleman, you must get her\r\noff your hands--you must, indeed.--I shall have her a bargain, I see\r\nthat--your servant!--Zounds, how late it is--but never be put out of\r\nyour way for a woman--I must run--my wife will play the devil with me\r\nfor keeping breakfast.\r\n\r\n                                                               [_Exit._\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Trudge.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Sir!\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Have you provided a proper apartment?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Yes, sir, at the Crown here; a neat, spruce room they tell\r\nme. You have not seen such a convenient lodging this good while, I\r\nbelieve.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Are there no better inns in the town?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Um----Why there is the Lion, I hear, and the Bear, and the\r\nBoar--but we saw them at the door of all our late lodgings, and found\r\nbut bad accommodations within, sir.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Well, run to the end of the quay, and conduct Yarico hither.\r\nThe road is straight before you: you can't miss it.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Very well, sir. What a fine thing it is to turn one's back on\r\na master, without running into a wolf's belly! One can follow one's\r\nnose on a message here, and be sure it won't be bit off by the way.\r\n\r\n                                                               [_Exit._\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Let me reflect a little. Part with her!--My interest, honour,\r\nengagements to Narcissa, all demand it. My father's precepts too--I can\r\nremember, when I was a boy, what pains he took to mould me.--School'd\r\nme from morn to night--and still the burden of his song was--Prudence!\r\nPrudence! Thomas, and you'll rise. His maxims rooted in my heart, and\r\nas I grew--_they_ grew; till I was reckoned, among our friends, a\r\nsteady, sober, solid, good young man; and all the neighbours call'd\r\nme _the prudent Mr. Thomas_. And shall I now, at once, kick down the\r\ncharacter which I have raised so warily?--Part with her--sell her!--The\r\nthought once struck me in our cabin, as she lay sleeping by me; but, in\r\nher slumbers, she passed her arm around me, murmured a blessing on my\r\nname, and broke my meditations.\r\n\r\n_Enter YARICO and TRUDGE._\r\n\r\n_Yar._ My love!\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ I have been showing her all the wigs and bales of goods we\r\nmet on the quay, sir.\r\n\r\n_Yar._ Oh! I have feasted my eyes on wonders.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ And I'll go feast on a slice of beef, in the inn, here.\r\n\r\n                                                               [_Exit._\r\n\r\n_Yar._ My mind has been so busy, that I almost forgot even you. I wish\r\nyou had stayed with me--You would have seen such sights!\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Those sights have become familiar to me, Yarico.\r\n\r\n_Yar._ And yet I wish they were not--You might partake my  pleasures--but\r\nnow again, methinks, I will not wish so--for, with too much gazing, you\r\nmight neglect poor _Yarico_.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Nay, nay, my care is still for you.\r\n\r\n_Yar._ I am sure it is: and if I thought it was not, I would tell you\r\ntales about our poor old grot--bid you remember our palm-tree near the\r\nbrook, where in the shade you often stretched yourself, while I would\r\ntake your head upon my lap, and sing my love to sleep. I know you'll\r\nlove me then.\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG.\r\n\r\n  _Our grotto was the sweetest place!_\r\n    _The bending boughs, with fragrance blowing,_\r\n  _Would check the brook's impetuous pace,_\r\n    _Which murmur'd to be stopp'd from flowing._\r\n  _'Twas there we met, and gaz'd our fill:_\r\n  _Ah! think on this, and love me still._\r\n\r\n  _'Twas then my bosom first knew fear,_\r\n    _--Fear to an Indian maid a stranger--_\r\n  _The war-song, arrows, hatchet, spear,_\r\n    _All warn'd me of my lover's danger._\r\n  _For him did cares my bosom fill:--_\r\n  _Ah! think on this, and love me still._\r\n\r\n  _For him, by day, with care conceal'd,_\r\n    _To search for food I climb'd the mountain;_\r\n  _And when the night no form reveal'd,_\r\n    _Jocund we sought the bubbling fountain._\r\n  _Then, then would joy my bosom fill;_\r\n  _Ah! think on this and love me still._\r\n\r\n                                                             [_Exeunt._\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II.\r\n\r\n    _An Apartment in the House of SIR CHRISTOPHER CURRY._\r\n\r\n_Enter SIR CHRISTOPHER and MEDIUM._\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ I tell you, old Medium, you are all wrong. Plague on your\r\ndoubts! Inkle _shall_ have my Narcissa. Poor fellow! I dare say he's\r\nfinely chagrined at this temporary parting--Eat up with the blue\r\ndevils, I warrant.\r\n\r\n_Med._ Eat up by the black devils, I warrant; for I left him in hellish\r\nhungry company.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Pshaw! he'll arrive with the next vessel, depend\r\non't--besides, have not I had this in view ever since they were\r\nchildren? I must and will have it so, I tell you. Is not it, as it\r\nwere, a marriage made above? They _shall_ meet, I'm positive.\r\n\r\n_Med._ Shall they? Then they must meet where the marriage was made; for\r\nhang me, if I think it will ever happen below.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Ha!--and if that is the case--hang me, if I think you'll\r\never be at the celebration of it.\r\n\r\n_Med._ Yet, let me tell you, Sir Christopher Curry, my character is as\r\nunsullied as a sheet of white paper.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Well said, old fool's-cap! and it's as mere a blank as a\r\nsheet of white paper. You are honest, old Medium, by comparison, just\r\nas a fellow sentenced to transportation is happier than his companion\r\ncondemned to the gallows--Very worthy, because you are no rogue; tender\r\nhearted, because you never go to fires and executions; and an affectionate\r\nfather and husband, because you never pinch your children, or kick your\r\nwife out of bed.\r\n\r\n_Med._ And that, as the world goes, is more than every man can say for\r\nhimself. Yet, since you force me to speak my positive qualities--but,\r\nno matter,--you remember me in London; didn't I, as member of the\r\nHumane Society, bring a man out of the New River, who, it was\r\nafterwards found, had done me an injury?\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ And, dam'me, if I would not kick any man into the New River\r\nthat had done me an injury. There's the difference of our honesty.\r\nOons! if you want to be an honest fellow, act from the impulse of\r\nnature. Why, you have no more gall than a pigeon.\r\n\r\n_Med._ And you have as much gall as a turkey cock, and are as hot into\r\nthe bargain--You're always so hasty; among the hodge-podge of your\r\nfoibles, passion is always predominant.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ So much the better.----Foibles, quotha? foibles are foils\r\nthat give additional lustre to the gems of virtue. You have not so many\r\nfoils as I, perhaps.\r\n\r\n_Med._ And, what's more, I don't want 'em, Sir Christopher, I thank you.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Very true; for the devil a gem have you to set off with 'em.\r\n\r\n_Med._ Well, well; I never mention errors; that, I flatter myself, is\r\nno disagreeable quality.--It don't become me to say you are hot.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ 'Sblood! but it does become you: it becomes every man,\r\nespecially an Englishman, to speak the dictates of his heart.\r\n\r\n_Enter SERVANT._\r\n\r\n_Serv._ An English vessel, sir, just arrived in the harbour.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ A vessel!

I'll go and prepare Narcissa directly;\r\nthey shall be married slap-dash, as soon as he comes from the quay. From\r\nNeptune to Hymen: from the hammock to the bridal bed--Ha! old boy!\r\n\r\n_Med._ Well, well; don't flurry yourself--you're so hot!\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Hot! blood, ar'n't I in the West Indies? Ar'n't I governor\r\nof Barbadoes? He shall have her as soon as he sets his foot on shore.\r\n\"But, plague on't, he's so slow.\"--She shall rise to him like Venus out\r\nof the sea. His hair puffed? He ought to have been puffing, here, out\r\nof breath, by this time.\r\n\r\n_Med._ Very true; but Venus's husband is always supposed to be lame,\r\nyou know, Sir Christopher.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Well, now do, my good fellow, run down to the shore, and see\r\nwhat detains him.\r\n\r\n                                                   [_Hurrying him off._\r\n\r\n_Med._ Well, well; I will, I will.\r\n\r\n                                                               [_Exit._\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ In the mean time I'll get ready Narcissa, and all shall be\r\nconcluded in a second.

Well, and\r\nhow, eh! tell me!--But old Medium and I have talked over your affair a\r\nhundred times a day, ever since Narcissa arrived.\r\n\r\n_Camp._ You surprise me! Are you then really acquainted with the whole\r\naffair?\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Every tittle.\r\n\r\n_Camp._ And, can you, sir, pardon what is past?--\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Pooh! how could you help it?\r\n\r\n_Camp._ Very true--sailing in the same ship--and--But when you consider\r\nthe past state of my mind----the black prospect before me.--\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Ha! ha! Black enough, I dare say.\r\n\r\n_Camp._ The difficulty I have felt in bringing myself face to face to you.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ That I am convinced of--but I knew you would come the first\r\nopportunity.\r\n\r\n_Camp._ Very true: yet the distance between the Governor of Barbadoes\r\nand myself. [_Bowing._]\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Yes--a devilish way asunder.\r\n\r\n_Camp._ Granted, sir: which has distressed me with the cruellest doubts\r\nas to our meeting.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ It was a toss up.\r\n\r\n_Camp._ The old gentleman seems devilish kind.--Now to soften him.\r\n[_Aside._] Perhaps, sir, in your younger days, you may have been in the\r\nsame situation yourself.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Who? I! 'sblood! no, never in my life.\r\n\r\n_Camp._ I wish you had, with all my soul, Sir Christopher.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Upon my soul, Sir, I am very much obliged to you. [_Bowing._]\r\n\r\n_Camp._ As what I now mention might have greater weight with you.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Pooh! pr'ythee! I tell you I pitied you from the bottom of\r\nmy heart.\r\n\r\n_Camp._ Indeed! if, with your leave, I may still venture to mention\r\nMiss Narcissa--\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ An impatient, sensible young dog! like me to a hair! Set\r\nyour heart at rest, my boy. She's yours; yours before to-morrow morning.\r\n\r\n_Camp._ Amazement! I can scarce believe my senses.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Zounds! you ought to be out of your senses: but dispatch--make\r\nshort work of it, ever while you live, my boy. Here she is.\r\n\r\n_Enter NARCISSA and PATTY._\r\n\r\nHere girl: here's your swain.\r\n\r\n                                                             [_To NAR._\r\n\r\n_Camp._ I just parted with my Narcissa, on the quay, sir.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Did you! Ah, sly dog----had a meeting before you came to the\r\nold gentleman.--But here--Take him, and make much of him--and, for fear\r\nof further separations, you shall e'en be tacked together directly.\r\nWhat say you, girl?\r\n\r\n_Camp._ Will my Narcissa consent to my happiness?\r\n\r\n_Nar._ I always obey my father's commands, with pleasure, sir.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Od! I'm so happy, I hardly know which way to turn; but we'll\r\nhave the carriage directly; drive down to the quay; trundle old Spintext\r\ninto church, and hey for matrimony!\r\n\r\n_Camp._ With all my heart, Sir Christopher; the sooner the better.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR CHRISTOPHER, CAMPLEY, NARCISSA, PATTY.\r\n\r\n  Sir Chr. _Your Colinettes, and Arriettes,_\r\n              _Your Damons of the grove,_\r\n            _Who like fallals, and pastorals,_\r\n                        _Waste years in love;_\r\n            _But modern folks know better jokes,_\r\n              _And, courting once begun,_\r\n            _To church they hop at once--and pop--_\r\n                        _Egad, all's done!_\r\n\r\n  All.     _In life we prance a country dance,_\r\n              _Where every couple stands;_\r\n            _Their partners set--a while curvet--_\r\n              _But soon join hands._\r\n\r\n  Nar.   _When at our feet, so trim and neat,_\r\n            _The powder'd lover sues,_\r\n          _He vows he dies, the lady sighs,_\r\n                      _But can't refuse._\r\n          _Ah! how can she unmov'd e'er see_\r\n            _Her swain his death incur?_\r\n          _If once the squire is seen expire,_\r\n                      _He lives with her._\r\n\r\n  All.   _In life, &c. &c._\r\n\r\n  Patty. _When John and Bet are fairly met,_\r\n            _John boldly tries his luck;_\r\n          _He steals a buss, without more fuss,_\r\n                      _The bargain's struck._\r\n          _Whilst things below are going so,_\r\n            _Is Betty pray to blame?_\r\n          _Who knows up stairs, her mistress fares_\r\n                      _Just, just the same._\r\n\r\n  All.   _In life we prance, &c. &c._\r\n\r\n                                                               [Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACT THE THIRD.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE I.\r\n\r\n    _The Quay._\r\n\r\n_Enter PATTY._\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Mercy on us! what a walk I have had of it! Well, matters go on\r\nswimmingly at the Governor's--The old gentleman has ordered the carriage,\r\nand the young couple will be whisked here, to church, in a quarter of an\r\nhour. My business is to prevent young sobersides, young Inkle, from\r\nappearing, to interrupt the ceremony.--Ha! here's the Crown, where I\r\nhear he is housed: So now to find Trudge, and trump up a story, in the\r\ntrue style of a chambermaid. [_Goes into the house._] [_PATTY within._]\r\nI tell you it don't signify, and I will come up. [_TRUDGE within._] But\r\nit does signify, and you can't come up.\r\n\r\n_Re-enter PATTY with TRUDGE._\r\n\r\n_Patty._ You had better say at once, I shan't.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Well then, you shan't.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Savage! Pretty behaviour you have picked up amongst the\r\nHottypots! Your London civility, like London itself, will soon be lost\r\nin smoke, Mr. Trudge: and the politeness you have studied so long in\r\nThreadneedle-street, blotted out by the blacks you have been living\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ No such thing; I practised my politeness all the while I was\r\nin the woods. Our very lodging taught me good manners; for I could\r\nnever bring myself to go into it without bowing.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Don't tell me! A mighty civil reception you give a body,\r\ntruly, after a six weeks parting.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Gad, you're right; I am a little out here, to be sure.\r\n[_Kisses her._] Well, how do you do?\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Pshaw, fellow! I want none of your kisses.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Oh! very well--I'll take it again. [_Offers to kiss her._]\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Be quiet. I want to see Mr. Inkle: I have a message to him\r\nfrom Miss Narcissa. I shall get a sight of him, now, I believe.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ May be not. He's a little busy at present.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Busy--ha! Plodding! What he's at his multiplication table again?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Very likely; so it would be a pity to interrupt him, you know.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Certainly; and the whole of my business was to prevent his\r\nhurrying himself--Tell him, we shan't be ready to receive him, at the\r\nGovernor's, till to-morrow, d'ye hear?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ No?\r\n\r\n_Patty._ No. Things are not prepared. The place isn't in order; and the\r\nservants have not had proper notice of the arrival. Sir Christopher\r\nintends Mr. Inkle, you know, for his son-in-law, and must receive him\r\nin public form, (which can't be till to-morrow morning) for the honour\r\nof his governorship: why the whole island will ring of it.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ The devil it will!\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Yes; they've talked of nothing but my mistress's beauty and\r\nfortune for these six weeks. Then he'll be introduced to the bride, you\r\nknow.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ O, my poor master!\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Then a breakfast; then a procession; then--if nothing happens\r\nto prevent it, he'll get into church, and be married in a crack.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Then he'll get into a damn'd scrape, in a crack.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Hey-day! a scrape! How!\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Nothing, nothing----It must out----Patty!\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Well!\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Can you keep a secret?\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Try me.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Then [_Whispering._] My master keeps a girl.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Oh, monstrous! another woman?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ As sure as one and one make two.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ [_Aside._] Rare news for my mistress!--Why I can hardly believe\r\nit: the grave, sly, steady, sober Mr. Inkle, do such a thing!\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Pooh! it's always your sly, sober fellows, that go the most\r\nafter the girls.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Well; I should sooner suspect _you_.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Me? Oh Lord! he! he!--Do you think any smart, tight, little,\r\nblack-eyed wench, would be struck with my figure? [_Conceitedly._]\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Pshaw! never mind your figure. Tell me how it happened?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ You shall hear: when the ship left us ashore, my master\r\nturned as pale as a sheet of paper. It isn't every body that's blest\r\nwith courage, Patty.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ True.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ However, I bid him cheer up; told him, to stick to my elbow:\r\ntook the lead, and began our march.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Well?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ We hadn't gone far, when a damn'd one-eyed black boar, that\r\ngrinned like a devil, came down the hill in jog trot! My Master melted\r\nas fast as a pot of pomatum!\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Mercy on us!\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ But what does I do, but whips out my desk knife, that I used\r\nto cut the quills with at home; met the monster, and slit up his throat\r\nlike a pen--The boar bled like a pig.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Lord! Trudge, what a great traveller you are!\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Yes; I remember we fed on the flitch for a week.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Well, well; but the lady.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ The lady! Oh, true. By and by we came to a cave--a large\r\nhollow room, under ground, like a warehouse in the Adelphi.--Well;\r\nthere we were half an hour, before I could get him to go in; there's no\r\naccounting for fear, you know. At last, in we went, to a place hung round\r\nwith skins, as it might be a furrier's shop, and there was a fine lady,\r\nsnoring on a bow and arrows.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ What, all alone?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Eh!--No--no.--Hum--She had a young lion, by way of a lap-dog.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Gemini; what did you do?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Gave her a jog, and she opened her eyes--she struck my master\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Mercy on us! with what?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ With her beauty, you ninny, to be sure: and they soon brought\r\nmatters to bear. The wolves witnessed the contract--I gave her away--The\r\ncrows croaked amen; and we had board and lodging for nothing.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ And this is she he has brought to Barbadoes?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ The same.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Well; and tell me, Trudge;--she's pretty, you say--Is she fair\r\nor brown? or----\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Um! she's a good comely copper.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ How! a tawny?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Yes, quite dark; but very elegant; like a Wedgwood tea-pot.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Oh! the monster! the filthy fellow! Live with a black-a-moor!\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Why, there's no great harm in't, I hope?\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Faugh! I wou'dn't let him kiss me for the world: he'd make my\r\nface all smutty.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Zounds! you are mighty nice all of a sudden; but I'd have you\r\nto know, Madam Patty, that Black-a-moor ladies, as you call 'em, are\r\nsome of the very few whose complexions never rub off! 'Sbud, if they\r\ndid, Wows and I should have changed faces by this time--But mum; not a\r\nword for your life.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Not I! except to the Governor and family. [_Aside._] But I\r\nmust run--and, remember, Trudge, if your master has made a mistake\r\nhere, he has himself to thank for his pains.\r\n\r\n                                                         [_Exit PATTY._\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Pshaw! these girls are so plaguy proud of their white and\r\nred! but I won't be shamed out of Wows, that's flat.--\r\n\r\n_Enter WOWSKI._\r\n\r\nAh! Wows, I'm going to leave you.\r\n\r\n_Wows._ For what you leave me?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Master says I must.\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Ah, but you say in your country, women know best; and I say you\r\nnot leave me.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Master, to be sure, while we were in the forest, taught\r\nYarico to read, with his pencil and pocket-book. What then? Wows comes\r\non fine and fast in her lessons. A little awkward at first, to be\r\nsure--Ha! ha!--She's so used to feed with her hands, that I can't get\r\nher to eat her victuals, in a genteel, christian way, for the soul of\r\nme; when she has stuck a morsel on her fork, she don't know how to\r\nguide it, but pops up her knuckles to her mouth, and the meat goes up\r\nto her ear. But, no matter--After all the fine, flashy London girls,\r\nWowski's the wench for my money.\r\n\r\n\r\nSONG.\r\n\r\n  _A clerk I was in London gay,_\r\n      _Jemmy linkum feedle,_\r\n  _And went in boots to see the play,_\r\n      _Merry fiddlem tweedle._\r\n  _I march'd the lobby, twirled my stick,_\r\n      _Diddle, daddle, deedle;_\r\n  _The girls all cry'd, \"He's quite the kick.\"_\r\n      _Oh, Jemmy linkum feedle._\r\n\r\n  _Hey! for America I sail,_\r\n      _Yankee doodle, deedle;_\r\n  _The sailor-boys cry'd, \"Smoke his tail!\"_\r\n      _Jemmy linkum feedle._\r\n  _On English belles I turned my back,_\r\n      _Diddle, daddle, deedle;_\r\n  _And got a foreign fair quite black,_\r\n      _O twaddle, twaddle, tweedle!_\r\n\r\n  _Your London girls, with roguish trip,_\r\n      _Wheedle, wheedle, wheedle,_\r\n  _May boast their pouting under lip,_\r\n      _Fiddle, faddle, feedle._\r\n  _My Wows would beat a hundred such,_\r\n      _Diddle, daddle, deedle,_\r\n  _Whose upper lip pouts twice as much,_\r\n      _O, pretty double wheedle!_\r\n\r\n  _Rings I'll buy to deck her toes;_\r\n      _Jemmy linkum feedle;_\r\n  _A feather fine shall grace her nose,_\r\n      _Waving siddle seedle._\r\n  _With jealousy I ne'er shall burst;_\r\n      _Who'd steal my bone of bone-a?_\r\n  _A white Othello, I can trust_\r\n      _A dingy Desdemona._\r\n\r\n                                                               [Exeunt.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE II.\r\n\r\n    _A Room in the Crown._\r\n\r\n[_Enter INKLE._]\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ I know not what to think--I have given her distant hints of\r\nparting; but still, so strong her confidence in my affection, she\r\nprattles on without regarding me. Poor Yarico! I must not--cannot quit\r\nher. When I would speak, her look, her mere simplicity disarms me; I dare\r\nnot wound such innocence. Simplicity is like a smiling babe, which, to\r\nthe ruffian that would murder it, stretching its little naked, helpless\r\narms, pleads, speechless, its own cause. And yet, Narcissa's family--\r\n\r\n_Enter TRUDGE._\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ There he is; like a beau bespeaking a coat--doubting which\r\ncolour to choose--Sir--\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ What now?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Nothing unexpected, sir:--I hope you won't be angry; but I am\r\ncome to give you joy, sir!\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Joy!----of what?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ A wife, sir! a white one.--I know it will vex you, but Miss\r\nNarcissa means to make you happy, to-morrow morning.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ To-morrow!\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Yes, sir; and as I have been out of employ, in both my\r\ncapacities, lately, after I have dressed your hair, I may draw up the\r\nmarriage articles.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Whence comes your intelligence, sir?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Patty told me all that has passed in the Governor's family,\r\non the quay, sir. Women, you know, can never keep a secret. You'll be\r\nintroduced in form, with the whole island to witness it.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ So public, too!----Unlucky!\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ There will be nothing but rejoicings, in compliment to the\r\nwedding, she tells me; all noise and uproar! Married people like it,\r\nthey say.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Strange! that I should be so blind to my interest, as to be\r\nthe only person this distresses.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ They are talking of nothing else but the match, it seems.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Confusion! How can I, in honour, retract?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ And the bride's merits----\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ True!--A fund of merits!--I would not--but from necessity--a\r\ncase so nice as this--I--would not wish to retract.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Then they call her so handsome.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Very true! so handsome! the whole world would laugh at me;\r\nthey'd call it folly to retract.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ And then they say so much of her fortune.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ O death! it would be _madness_ to retract. Surely, my\r\nfaculties have slept, and this long parting from my Narcissa has\r\nblunted my sense of her accomplishments. 'Tis this alone makes me so\r\nweak and wavering. I'll see her immediately. [_Going._]\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Stay, stay, sir; I am desired to tell you, the Governor won't\r\nopen his gates to us till to-morrow morning.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Well, be it so; it will give me time, at all events, to put my\r\naffairs in train.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Yes; it's a short respite before execution; and if your\r\nhonour was to go and comfort poor Madam Yarico----\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Damnation! Scoundrel, how dare you offer your advice?--I dread\r\nto think of her!\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ I've done, sir, I've done--But I know I should blubber over\r\nWows all night, if I thought of parting with her in the morning.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Insolence! begone, sir!\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Lord, sir, I only----\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Get down stairs, sir, directly.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ [_Going out._] Ah! you may well put your hand to your head;\r\nand a bad head it must be, to forget that Madam Yarico prevented her\r\ncountrymen from peeling off the upper part of it. [_Aside._]\r\n\r\n                                                               [_Exit._\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ 'Sdeath, what am I about? How have I slumbered! Is it I?--I--who,\r\nin London, laughed at the younkers of the town--and, when I saw their\r\nchariots, with some fine, tempting girl, perked in the corner, come\r\nshopping to the city, would cry--Ah!--there sits ruin--there flies the\r\nGreen-horn's money! then wondered with myself how men could trifle time\r\non women; or, indeed, think of any women without fortunes. And now,\r\nforsooth, it rests with _me_ to turn romantic puppy, and give up all\r\nfor love.--Give up!--Oh, monstrous folly!--thirty thousand pounds!\r\n\r\nTRUDGE. [_Peeping in at the door._]\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ May I come in, sir?\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ What does the booby want?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Sir, your uncle wants to see _you_.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Mr. Medium! show him up directly.\r\n\r\n                                                        [_Exit TRUDGE._\r\n\r\nHe must not know of this.

I wish this marriage were more\r\ndistant, that I might break it to her by degrees: she'd take my purpose\r\nbetter, were it less suddenly delivered.\r\n\r\n_Enter MEDIUM._\r\n\r\n_Med._ Ah! here he is! Give me your hand, nephew! welcome, welcome to\r\nBarbadoes, with all my heart.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ I am glad to meet you here, uncle!\r\n\r\n_Med._ That you are, that you are, I'm sure. Lord! Lord! when we parted\r\nlast, how I wished we were in a room together, if it were but the black\r\nhole! I have not been able to sleep o'nights for thinking of you. I've\r\nlaid awake, and fancied I saw you sleeping your last, with your head in\r\nthe lion's mouth, for a night-cap! and I've never seen a bear brought\r\nover to dance about the street, but I thought you might be bobbing up\r\nand down in its belly.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ I am very much obliged to you.\r\n\r\n_Med._ Aye, aye, I am happy enough to find you safe and sound, I promise\r\nyou. But, you have a fine prospect before you now, young man. I am come\r\nto take you with me to Sir Christopher, who is impatient to see you.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ To-morrow, I hear, he expects me.\r\n\r\n_Med._ To-morrow! directly--this moment--in half a second.--I left him\r\nstanding on tip-toe, as he calls it, to embrace you; and he's standing\r\non tiptoe now in the great parlour, and there he'll stand till you come\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Is he so hasty?\r\n\r\n_Med._ Hasty! he's all pepper--and wonders you are not with him, before\r\nit's possible to get at him. Hasty, indeed! Why, he vows you shall have\r\nhis daughter this very night.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ What a situation!\r\n\r\n_Med._ Why, it's hardly fair just after a voyage. But come, bustle,\r\nbustle, he'll think you neglect him. He's rare and touchy, I can tell\r\nyou; and if he once takes it into his head that you show the least\r\nslight to his daughter, it would knock up all your schemes in a minute.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Confusion! If he should hear of Yarico! [_Aside._]\r\n\r\n_Med._ But at present you are all and all with him; he has been telling\r\nme his intentions these six weeks; you'll be a fine warm husband, I\r\npromise you.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ This cursed connexion! [_Aside._]\r\n\r\n_Med._ It is not for me, though, to tell you how to play your cards;\r\nyou are a prudent young man, and can make calculations in a wood.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Fool! fool! fool! [_Aside._]\r\n\r\n_Med._ Why, what the devil is the matter with you?\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ It must be done effectually, or all is lost; mere parting\r\nwould not conceal it. [_Aside._]\r\n\r\n_Med._ Ah! now he's got to his damn'd square root again, I suppose, and\r\nOld Nick would not move him.--Why, nephew!\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ The planter that I spoke with cannot be arrived--but time is\r\nprecious--the first I meet--common prudence now demands it. I'm fixed,\r\nI'll part with her. [_Aside._]\r\n\r\n                                                               [_Exit._\r\n\r\n_Med._ Damn me, but he's mad! The woods have turned the poor boy's\r\nbrains; he's scalped, and gone crazy! Hoho! Inkle! Nephew! Gad, I'll\r\nspoil your arithmetic, I warrant me.\r\n\r\n                                                               [_Exit._\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE III.\r\n\r\n    _The Quay._\r\n\r\n_Enter SIR CHRISTOPHER CURRY._\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Ods, my life! I can scarce contain my happiness. I have left\r\nthem safe in church, in the middle of the ceremony. I ought to have\r\ngiven Narcissa away, they told me; but I capered about so much for joy,\r\nthat Old Spintext advised me to go and cool my heels on the quay, till\r\nit was all over. Ods I'm so happy; and they shall see, now, what an old\r\nfellow can do at a wedding.\r\n\r\n_Enter INKLE._\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Now for dispatch! Hark'ee, old gentleman! [_To the Governor._]\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Well, young gentleman?\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ If I mistake not, I know your business here.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ 'Egad, I believe half the island knows it, by this time.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Then to the point--I have a female, whom I wish to part with.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Very likely; it's a common case, now a-days, with many a man.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ If you could satisfy me you would use her mildly, and treat\r\nher with more kindness than is usual--for I can tell you she's of no\r\ncommon stamp--perhaps we might agree.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Oho! a slave! Faith, now I think on't, my daughter may want\r\nan attendant or two extraordinary; and as you say she's a delicate\r\ngirl, above the common run, and none of your thick-lipped, flat-nosed,\r\nsquabby, dumpling dowdies, I don't much care if--\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ And for her treatment--\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Look ye, young man; I love to be plain: I shall treat her\r\na good deal better than you would, I fancy; for though I witness this\r\ncustom every day, I can't help thinking the only excuse for buying our\r\nfellow creatures, is to rescue them from the hands of those who are\r\nunfeeling enough to bring them to market.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Fair words, old gentleman; an Englishman won't put up an affront.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ An Englishman! more shame for you! Let Englishmen blush at\r\nsuch practices. Men, who so fully feel the blessings of liberty, are\r\ndoubly cruel in depriving the helpless of their freedom.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Let me assure you, sir, it is not my occupation; but for a\r\nprivate reason--an instant pressing necessity----\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Well, well, I have a pressing necessity too; I can't stand\r\nto talk now; I expect company here presently; but if you'll ask for me\r\nto-morrow, at the Castle--\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ The Castle!\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Aye, sir, the Castle; the Governor's Castle; known all over\r\nBarbadoes.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ 'Sdeath this man must be on the Governor's establishment:\r\nhis steward, perhaps, and sent after me, while Sir Christopher is\r\nimpatiently waiting for me. I've gone too far; my secret may be\r\nknown--As 'tis, I'll win this fellow to my interest. [_To him._]--One\r\nword more, sir: my business must be done immediately; and as you seem\r\nacquainted at the Castle, if you should see me there--and there I mean\r\nto sleep to-night----\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ The devil you do!\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Your finger on your lips; and never breathe a syllable of this\r\ntransaction.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ No! Why not?\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Because, for reasons, which, perhaps, you'll know to-morrow, I\r\nmight be injured with the Governor, whose most particular friend I am.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ So! here's a particular friend of mine, coming to sleep\r\nat my house, that I never saw in my life. I'll sound this fellow.\r\n[_Aside._] I fancy, young gentleman, as you are such a bosom friend of\r\nthe Governor's, you can hardly do any thing to alter your situation\r\nwith him?\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Oh! pardon me; but you'll find that hereafter--besides, you,\r\ndoubtless, know his character?\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Oh, as well as I do my own. But let's understand one\r\nanother. You may trust me, now you've gone so far. You are acquainted\r\nwith his character, no doubt, to a hair?\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ I am--I see we shall understand each other. You know him too,\r\nI see, as well as I.--A very touchy, testy, hot old fellow.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Here's a scoundrel! I hot and touchy! Zounds! I can hardly\r\ncontain my passion!--But I won't discover myself. I'll see the bottom\r\nof this----[_To him._] Well now, as we seem to have come to a tolerable\r\nexplanation--let's proceed to business--Bring me the woman.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ No; there you must excuse me. I rather would avoid seeing her\r\nmore; and wish it to be settled without my seeming interference. My\r\npresence might distress her--You conceive me?\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Zounds! what an unfeeling rascal!--The poor girl's in love\r\nwith him, I suppose. No, no, fair and open. My dealing is with you and\r\nyou only: I see her now, or I declare off.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Well then, you must be satisfied: yonder's my servant--ha--a\r\nthought has struck me. Come here, sir.\r\n\r\n_Enter TRUDGE._\r\n\r\nI'll write my purpose, and send it her by him--It's lucky that I taught\r\nher to decypher characters; my labour now is paid. [_Takes out his\r\npocket book, and writes._]--This is somewhat less abrupt; 'twill soften\r\nmatters. [_To himself._] Give this to Yarico; then bring her hither\r\nwith you.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ I shall, sir. [_Going._]\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Stay; come back. This soft fool, if uninstructed, may add to her\r\ndistress. When she has read this paper, seem to make light of it; tell\r\nher it is a thing of course, done purely for her good. I here inform her\r\nthat I must part with her. D'ye understand your lesson?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Pa--part with Ma--madam Ya-ri-co!\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Why does the blockhead stammer!--I have my reasons. No\r\nmuttering--And let me tell you, sir, if your rare bargain were gone\r\ntoo, 'twould be the better: she may babble our story of the forest, and\r\nspoil my fortune.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ I'm sorry for it, sir; I have lived with you along while;\r\nI've half a year's wages too, due the 25th ult. for dressing your hair,\r\nand scribbling your parchments; but take my scribbling; take my\r\nfrizzing; take my wages; and I, and Wows, will take ourselves off\r\ntogether--she saved my life, and rot me, if any thing but death shall\r\npart us.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Impertinent! Go, and deliver your message.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ I'm gone, sir. Lord, Lord! I never carried a letter with such\r\nill will in all my born days.\r\n\r\n                                                               [_Exit._\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Well--shall I see the girl?\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ She'll be here presently. One thing I had forgot: when she is\r\nyours, I need not caution you, after the hints I've given, to keep her\r\nfrom the Castle. If Sir Christopher should see her, 'twould lead, you\r\nknow, to a discovery of what I wish concealed.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Depend upon _me_--Sir Christopher will know no more of our\r\nmeeting, than he does at this moment.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Your secrecy shall not be unrewarded; I'll recommend you,\r\nparticularly, to his good graces.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Thank ye, thank ye; but I'm pretty much in his good graces,\r\nas it is; I don't know anybody he has a greater respect for.----\r\n\r\n_Re-enter TRUDGE._\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Now, sir, have you performed your message?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Yes, I gave her the letter.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ And where is Yarico? did she say she'd come? didn't you do as\r\nyou were ordered? didn't you speak to her?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ I cou'dn't, sir, I cou'dn't--I intended to say what you bid\r\nme--but I felt such a pain in my throat, I cou'dn't speak a word, for\r\nthe soul of me; and so, sir, I fell a crying.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Blockhead!\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ 'Sblood, but he's a very honest blockhead. Tell me, my good\r\nfellow--what said the wench?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Nothing at all, sir. She sat down with her two hands clasped\r\non her knees, and looked so pitifully in my face, I could not stand it.\r\nOh, here she comes. I'll go and find Wows: if I must be melancholy, she\r\nshall keep me company.\r\n\r\n                                                               [_Exit._\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Ods my life, as comely a wench as ever I saw!\r\n\r\n_Enter YARICO, who looks for some time in INKLE's face, bursts into\r\ntears, and falls on his neck._\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ In tears! nay, Yarico! why this?\r\n\r\n_Yar._ Oh do not--do not leave me!\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Why, simple girl! I'm labouring for your good. My interest,\r\nhere, is nothing: I can do nothing from myself, you are ignorant of our\r\ncountry's customs. I must give way to men more powerful, who will not\r\nhave me with you. But see, my Yarico, ever anxious for your welfare,\r\nI've found a kind, good person who will protect you.\r\n\r\n_Yar._ Ah! why not you protect me!\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ I have no means--how can I?\r\n\r\n_Yarico._ Just as I sheltered you. Take me to yonder mountain, where I\r\nsee no smoke from tall, high houses, filled with your cruel countrymen.\r\nNone of your princes, there, will come to take me from you. And should\r\nthey stray that way, we'll find a lurking place, just like my own poor\r\ncave; where many a day I sat beside you, and blessed the chance that\r\nbrought you to it--that I might save your life.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ His life! Zounds! my blood boils at the scoundrel's\r\ningratitude!\r\n\r\n_Yar._ Come, come, let's go. I always feared these cities. Let's fly\r\nand seek the woods; and there we'll wander hand in hand together. No\r\ncares shall vex us then--We'll let the day glide by in idleness; and\r\nyou shall sit in the shade, and watch the sun-beam playing on the\r\nbrook, while I sing the song that pleases you. No cares, love, but for\r\nfood--and we'll live cheerily I warrant--In the fresh, early morning,\r\nyou shall hunt down our game, and I will pick you berries--and then, at\r\nnight I'll trim our bed of leaves, and lie me down in peace--Oh! we\r\nshall be so happy!----\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Hear me, Yarico. My countrymen and yours differ as much\r\nin minds as in complexions. We were not born to live in woods and\r\ncaves----to seek subsistence by pursuing beasts----We christians,\r\ngirl, hunt money; a thing unknown to you--But, here, 'tis money which\r\nbrings us ease, plenty, command, power, every thing; and, of course,\r\nhappiness. You are the bar to my attaining this; therefore 'tis\r\nnecessary for my good----and which, I think, you value----\r\n\r\n_Yar._ You know I do; so much, that it would break my heart to leave\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ But we must part; if you are seen with me, I shall lose all.\r\n\r\n_Yar._ I gave up all for you--my friends--my country: all that was dear\r\nto me: and still grown dearer since you sheltered there.--All, all, was\r\nleft for you--and were it now to do again--again I'd cross the seas, and\r\nfollow you, all the world over.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ We idle time; sir, she is yours. See you obey this gentleman;\r\n'twill be the better for you. [_Going._]\r\n\r\n_Yar._ O barbarous! [_Holding him._] Do not, do not abandon me!\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ No more.\r\n\r\n_Yar._ Stay but a little. I shan't live long to be a burden to you:\r\nyour cruelty has cut me to the heart. Protect me but a little--or I'll\r\nobey this man, and undergo all hardships for your good; stay but to\r\nwitness 'em.--I soon shall sink with grief; tarry till then, and hear\r\nme bless your name when I am dying; and beg you now and then, when I am\r\ngone, to heave a sigh for your poor Yarico.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ I dare not listen. You, sir, I hope, will take good care of\r\nher. [_Going._]\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Care of her!--that I will--I'll cherish her like my own\r\ndaughter; and pour balm into the heart of a poor, innocent girl, that\r\nhas been wounded by the artifices of a scoundrel.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Hah! 'Sdeath, sir, how dare you!--\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ 'Sdeath, sir, how dare you look an honest man in the face?\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Sir, you shall feel--\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Feel!--It's more than ever you did, I believe. Mean, sordid\r\nwretch! dead to all sense of honour, gratitude, or humanity--I never\r\nheard of such barbarity! I have a son-in-law, who has been left in\r\nthe same situation; but, if I thought him capable of such cruelty,\r\ndam'me if I would not turn him to sea, with a peck-loaf, in a cockle\r\nshell--Come, come, cheer up, my girl! You shan't want a friend to\r\nprotect you, I warrant you.--[_Taking YARICO by the hand._]\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Insolence! The Governor shall hear of this insult.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ The Governor! liar! cheat! rogue! impostor! breaking all\r\nties you ought to keep, and pretending to those you have no right to.\r\nThe Governor never had such a fellow in the whole catalogue of his\r\nacquaintance--the Governor disowns you--the Governor disclaims you--the\r\nGovernor abhors you; and to your utter confusion, here stands the\r\nGovernor to tell you so. Here stands old Curry, who never talked to a\r\nrogue without telling him what he thought of him.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Sir Christopher!--Lost and undone!\r\n\r\n_Med._ [_Without._] Holo! Young Multiplication! Zounds! I have been\r\npeeping in every cranny of the house. Why, young Rule of Three!\r\n[_Enters from the inn._] Oh, here you are at last--Ah, Sir Christopher!\r\nWhat are you there! too impatient to wait at home. But here's one that\r\nwill make you easy, I fancy. [_Clapping INKLE on the shoulder._]\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ How came you to know him?\r\n\r\n_Med._ Ha! ha! Well, that's curious enough too. So you have been\r\ntalking here, without finding out each other.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ No, no; I have found him out with a vengeance.\r\n\r\n_Med._ Not you. Why this is the dear boy. It's my nephew; that is, your\r\nson-in-law, that is to be. It's Inkle!\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ It's a lie; and you're a purblind old booby,--and this dear\r\nboy is a damn'd scoundrel.\r\n\r\n_Med._ Hey-day! what's the meaning of this? One was mad before, and he\r\nhas bit the other, I suppose.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ But here comes the dear boy--the true boy--the jolly boy,\r\npiping hot from church, with my daughter.\r\n\r\n_Enter CAMPLEY, NARCISSA, and PATTY._\r\n\r\n_Med._ Campley!\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Who? Campley?--It's no such thing.\r\n\r\n_Camp._ That's my name, indeed, Sir Christopher.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ The devil it is! And how came you, sir, to impose upon me,\r\nand assume the name of Inkle? A name which every man of honesty ought\r\nto be ashamed of.\r\n\r\n_Camp._ I never did, sir.--Since I sailed from England with your\r\ndaughter, my affection has daily increased: and when I came to explain\r\nmyself to you, by a number of concurring circumstances, which I am now\r\npartly acquainted with, you mistook me for that gentleman. Yet had I\r\neven then been aware of your mistake, I must confess, the regard for my\r\nown happiness would have tempted me to let you remain undeceived.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ And did you, Narcissa, join in--\r\n\r\n_Nar._ How could I, my dear sir, disobey you?\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Lord your honour, what young lady could refuse a captain?\r\n\r\n_Camp._ I am a soldier, Sir Christopher. Love and war is the soldier's\r\nmotto; though my income is trifling to your _intended_ son-in-law's,\r\nstill the chance of war has enabled me to support the object of my love\r\nabove indigence. Her fortune, Sir Christopher, I do not consider myself\r\nby any means entitled to.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ 'Sblood! but you must though. Give me your hand, my young\r\nMars, and bless you both together!--Thank you, thank you for cheating\r\nan old fellow into giving his daughter to a lad of spirit, when he was\r\ngoing to throw her away upon one, in whose breast the mean passion of\r\navarice smothers the smallest spark of affection or humanity.\r\n\r\n_Nar._ I have this moment heard a story of a transaction in the forest,\r\nwhich I own would have rendered compliance with your former commands\r\nvery disagreeable.\r\n\r\n_Patty._ Yes, sir, I told my mistress he had brought over a Hottypot\r\ngentlewoman.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Yes, but he would have left her for you; [_To Narcissa._]\r\nand you for his interest; and sold you, perhaps, as he has this poor\r\ngirl to me, as a requital for preserving his life.\r\n\r\n_Nar._ How!\r\n\r\n_Enter TRUDGE and WOWSKI._\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Come along, Wows! take a long last leave of your poor mistress:\r\nthrow your pretty, ebony arms about her neck.\r\n\r\n_Wows._ No, no;--she not go; you not leave poor Wowski. [_Throwing her\r\narms about YARICO._]\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Poor girl! A companion, I take it!\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ A thing of my own, sir. I cou'dn't help following my master's\r\nexample in the woods----_Like master, like man_, sir.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ But you would not sell her, and be hang'd to you, you dog,\r\nwould you?\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Hang me, like a dog, if I would, sir.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ So say I to every fellow that breaks an obligation due to\r\nthe feelings of a man. But, old Medium, what have you to say for your\r\nhopeful nephew?\r\n\r\n_Med._ I never speak ill of my friends, Sir Christopher.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Pshaw!\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Then let me speak: hear me defend a conduct----\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Defend! Zounds! plead guilty at once--it's the only hope\r\nleft of obtaining mercy.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Suppose, old gentleman, you had a son?\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ 'Sblood! then I'd make him an honest fellow; and teach him,\r\nthat the feeling heart never knows greater pride than when it's employed\r\nin giving succour to the unfortunate. I'd teach him to be his father's\r\nown son to a hair.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Even so my father tutored me: from my infancy, bending my\r\ntender mind, like a young sapling, to his will--Interest was the grand\r\nprop round which he twined my pliant green affections: taught me in\r\nchildhood to repeat old sayings--all tending to his own fixed principles,\r\nand the first sentence that I ever lisped, was--_Charity begins at home._\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ I shall never like a proverb again, as long as I live.\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ As I grew up, he'd prove--and by example--were I in want, I\r\nmight e'en starve, for what the world cared for their neighbours; why\r\nthen should I care for the world? Men now lived for themselves. These\r\nwere his doctrines: then, sir, what would you say, should I, in spite\r\nof habit, precept, education, fly in my father's face, and spurn his\r\ncouncils?\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Say! why, that you were a damn'd honest, undutiful fellow. O\r\ncurse such principles! Principles, which destroy all confidence between\r\nman and man--Principles which none but a rogue could instil, and none\r\nbut a rogue could imbibe.--Principles----\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Which I renounce.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Eh!\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Renounce entirely. Ill-founded precept too long has steeled\r\nmy breast--but still 'tis vulnerable--this trial was too much--Nature,\r\n'gainst habit combating within me, has penetrated to my heart; a heart,\r\nI own, long callous to the feelings of sensibility; but now it bleeds--and\r\nbleeds for my poor Yarico. Oh, let me clasp her to it, while 'tis glowing,\r\nand mingle tears of love and penitence. [_Embracing her._]\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ [_Capering about._] Wows, give me a kiss! [_WOWSKI goes to\r\nTRUDGE._]\r\n\r\n_Yar._ And shall we--shall we be happy?\r\n\r\n_Inkle._ Aye; ever, ever, Yarico.\r\n\r\n_Yar._ I knew we should--and yet I feared--but shall I still watch over\r\nyou? Oh! love, you surely gave your Yarico such pain, only to make her\r\nfeel this happiness the greater.\r\n\r\n_Wows._ [_Going to YARICO._] Oh Wowski so happy!--and yet I think I not\r\nglad neither.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ Eh, Wows! How!--why not!\r\n\r\n_Wows._ 'Cause I can't help cry----\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Then, if that's the case--curse me, if I think I'm very glad\r\neither. What the plague's the matter with my eyes?--Young man, your\r\nhand--I am now proud and happy to shake it.\r\n\r\n_Med._ Well, Sir Christopher, what do you say to my hopeful nephew now?\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ Say! Why, confound the fellow, I say, that is ungenerous\r\nenough to remember the bad action of a man who has virtue left in his\r\nheart to repent it--As for you, my good fellow, [_To TRUDGE._] I must,\r\nwith your master's permission, employ you myself.\r\n\r\n_Trudge._ O rare!--Bless your honour!--Wows! you'll be lady, you jade,\r\nto a governor's factotum.\r\n\r\n_Wows._ Iss--I Lady Jactotum.\r\n\r\n_Sir Chr._ And now, my young folks, we'll drive home, and celebrate the\r\nwedding. Od's my life! I long to be shaking a foot at the fiddles, and\r\nI shall dance ten times the lighter, for reforming an Inkle, while I\r\nhave it in my power to reward the innocence of a Yarico.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINALE.\r\n\r\n[La Belle Catharine.]\r\n\r\nCAMPLEY.\r\n\r\n  _Come, let us dance and sing,_\r\n  _While all Barbadoes bells shall ring:_\r\n  _Love scrapes the fiddle string,_\r\n      _And Venus plays the lute;_\r\n  _Hymen gay, foots away,_\r\n  _Happy at our wedding-day,_\r\n  _Cocks his chin, and figures in,_\r\n      _To tabor, fife, and flute._\r\n\r\nCHORUS.\r\n\r\n  _Come then dance and sing,_\r\n  _While all Barbadoes bells shall ring, &c._\r\n\r\nNARCISSA.\r\n\r\n  _Since thus each anxious care_\r\n  _Is vanished into empty air,_\r\n  _Ah! how can I forbear_\r\n      _To join the jocund dance?_\r\n  _To and fro, couples go,_\r\n  _On the light fantastic toe,_\r\n  _White with glee, merrily,_\r\n      _The rosy hours advance._\r\n          Chorus. _Come then, &c._\r\n\r\nYARICO.\r\n\r\n  _When first the swelling sea_\r\n  _Hither bore my love and me,_\r\n  _What then my fate would be,_\r\n      _Little did I think----_\r\n  _Doomed to know care and woe,_\r\n  _Happy still is Yarico;_\r\n  _Since her love will constant prove,_\r\n      _And nobly scorns to shrink._\r\n          Chorus. _Come then, &c._\r\n\r\nWOWSKI.\r\n\r\n  _Whilst all around, rejoice,_\r\n  _Pipe and tabor raise the voice,_\r\n  _It can't be Wowski's choice,_\r\n      _Whilst Trudge's to be dumb._\r\n  _No, no, dey blithe and gay,_\r\n  _Shall like massy, missy play._\r\n  _Dance and sing, hey ding, ding,_\r\n      _Strike fiddle and beat drum._\r\n          Chorus. _Come then, &c._\r\n\r\nTRUDGE.\r\n\r\n  _'Sbobs! now, I'm fix'd for life,_\r\n  _My fortune's fair, tho' black's my wife,_\r\n  _Who fears domestic strife--_\r\n      _Who cares now a souse!_\r\n  _Merry cheer my dingy dear_\r\n  _Shall find with her Factotum heve;_\r\n  _Night and day, I'll frisk and play_\r\n      _About the house with Wows._\r\n          Chorus. _Come then, &c._\r\n\r\nINKLE.\r\n\r\n  _Love's convert here behold,_\r\n  _Banish'd now my thirst of gold,_\r\n  _Bless'd in these arms to fold_\r\n      _My gentle Yarico._\r\n  _Hence all care, doubt, and fear,_\r\n  _Love and joy each want shall cheer,_\r\n  _Happy night, pure delight,_\r\n      _Shall make our bosoms glow._\r\n          Chorus. _Come then, &c._\r\n\r\nPATTY.\r\n\r\n  _Let Patty say a word----_\r\n  _A chambermaid may sure be heard----_\r\n  _Sure men are grown absurd,_\r\n      _Thus taking black for white;_\r\n  _To hug and kiss a dingy miss,_\r\n  _Will hardly suit an age like this,_\r\n  _Unless, here, some friends appear,_\r\n      _Who like this wedding night._\r\n          Chorus. _Come then, &c._\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END.",
