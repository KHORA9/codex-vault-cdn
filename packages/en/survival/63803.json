A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN PREFACE TO THE INTERNATIONAL SCIENTIFIC SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rapid development of science in the present age, and the\r\nincreasing public interest in its results, make it desirable that the\r\nmost efficient measures should be adopted to elevate the character\r\nof its popular literature. The tendency of careless and unscrupulous\r\nbook-makers to cater to public ignorance and love of the marvellous,\r\nand to foist their crude productions upon those who are too little\r\ninstructed to judge of their real quality, has hitherto been so\r\nstrong as to cast discredit upon the idea of \"popular science.\" It\r\nis highly important to counteract this evil tendency by furnishing\r\nthe public with popular scientific books of a superior character.\r\nThe publication of the present volume is the first step in carrying\r\nout a systematic enterprise of this kind. It initiates a series of\r\nsuch works on a wide range of scientific subjects, to be prepared\r\nby the leading thinkers of different countries, and known as the\r\n\"International Scientific Series.\"\r\n\r\nIt is designed to consist of compendious scientific treatises,\r\nrepresenting the latest advances of thought upon subjects of general\r\ninterest, theoretical and practical, to all classes of readers. The\r\nfamiliar phenomena of surrounding Nature, in their physical and\r\nchemical aspects, the knowledge of which has recently undergone\r\nmarked extension or revision, will be considered in their latest\r\ninterpretations. Biology, or the general science of life, which has\r\nlately come into prominence, will be explained in its leading and\r\nmost important principles. The subject of mind, which, under the\r\ninductive method and on the basis of its physical accompaniments\r\nand conditions, is giving rise to a new psychology, will be treated\r\nwith the fulness to which it is entitled. The laws of man's social\r\ndevelopment, or the natural history of society, which are now being\r\nstudied by the scientific method, will also receive a due share of\r\nattention. While the books of this series are to deal with a wide\r\ndiversity of topics, it will be a leading object of the enterprise\r\nto present the bearings of inquiry upon the higher questions of the\r\ntime, and to throw the latest light of science upon the phenomena of\r\nhuman nature and the economy of human life.\r\n\r\nAs the first requisite of such a series of works is trustworthiness,\r\ntheir preparation has been confided only to men of eminent ability,\r\nand who are recognized authorities in their several departments.\r\nAs they are to address the non-scientific public, it is a further\r\nrequisite that they should be written in familiar and intelligible\r\nlanguage. It is not to be expected that the authors will all attain\r\nto the same standard in this respect, but they are pledged to the\r\nutmost simplicity of exposition that is possible consistently with\r\nclear and accurate representation.\r\n\r\nAs science is now the supreme interest of civilization, and concerns\r\nalike the people of every country, and as, moreover, it affords a\r\ncommon ground upon which men of all races, tongues, faiths, and\r\nnationalities, may work together in harmony, it seemed fitting that\r\nan undertaking of this kind should be of comprehensive scope and\r\nstand upon an international basis. With the growing sentiment of\r\nsympathy and brotherhood among the most widely-separated students of\r\nNature, and the extensive facilities of business intercourse that now\r\nexist, there appeared no reason why an international combination of\r\nauthors and publishers should not be effected that would be equally\r\nfavourable to their own private interests and advantageous to the\r\npublic. To gain this end and guarantee to authors better remuneration\r\nfor their work, is a distinctive purpose of the present enterprise.\r\nBut there was this difficulty in the way of any such arrangement,\r\nthat, while the rights of foreign authors are guarded by all other\r\ncivilized governments, they are not protected by the government of\r\nthe United States. To escape this difficulty, and secure American\r\ncoöperation, the first thing needed was to obtain the consent of an\r\nAmerican publishing-house to grant voluntarily to foreign authors\r\nthe justice which our government denies them. It was agreed by\r\nMessrs. Appleton that they would pay the foreign contributors to\r\nthis series the full rates of copyright that are usually allowed\r\nto American authors. When this was done, engagements were made\r\nwith distinguished scientists of England, France, Germany, and the\r\nUnited States, to prepare works for the series, and with Henry S.\r\nKing & Co., of London, Germer Baillière, of Paris, and Messieurs\r\nBrockhaus, of Leipsic, to publish them. Negotiations are pending for\r\nthe reproduction of the series in other countries, but the present\r\narrangements secure to the authors the benefits of the four leading\r\nmarkets of the world.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact not without significance, that the proposal of this\r\nenterprise was received with the most cordial favour by the eminent\r\nscientific men who were solicited to aid in carrying it forward. Most\r\nof them consented at once; but, while some were so heavily burdened\r\nwith work that they could enter into no immediate engagements, not\r\none of them declined to coöperate, and all promised to do so at the\r\nearliest practicable opportunity. The feeling of the desirableness\r\nof such an undertaking was strong and unanimous. The old dislike of\r\nthe cultivators of science to participate in the work of popular\r\nteaching, seems very much to have passed away; and in England,\r\nFrance, and Germany, alike it was freely acknowledged that _savants_\r\nhave an imperative duty to discharge in relation to the work of\r\ngeneral scientific education. As remarked by Prof. Virchow, of\r\nBerlin, \"the destiny of science is the service of humanity.\"\r\n\r\nIt was stipulated by the authors that they should have ample time\r\nfor the preparation of their books, and, as the arrangements were\r\nrecently made, only a few of the works are yet ready. Several,\r\nhowever, are now in press, and will shortly appear.\r\n\r\nThose interested in the series are under many obligations to Prof.\r\nTyndall for his kindness in consenting to furnish its commencing\r\nvolume. Being prepared in a short time, amid great pressure both\r\nof laboratory and literary work, it contains somewhat less matter\r\nthan may be expected in the ensuing volumes. It treats of subjects\r\nupon which he is perhaps the highest living authority; and it is an\r\nadmirable example of that vivid, stirring, impressive style for which\r\nits author is so distinguished. Prof. Tyndall is not only a master in\r\nthe \"scientific use of the imagination,\" but in kindling the action\r\nof that faculty in his readers. He writes in pictures, so as to make\r\nthem see what he sees. In this volume he addresses himself directly\r\nto his juvenile friends, groups them around him, takes them with him\r\nto his favourite mountains, and thus adds a dramatic element and the\r\neffect of personal sympathy to familiar colloquial exposition.\r\n\r\nThe \"International Scientific Series\" will form an elegant and\r\nvaluable library of popular science, fresh in treatment, attractive\r\nin form, strong in character, moderate in price, and indispensable to\r\nall who care for the acquisition of solid and serviceable knowledge;\r\nand it is commended to American readers as a help in the important\r\nwork of sound public education.\r\n\r\n                                                            E. L. Y.\r\n\r\n  New York, _September, 1872_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTHOR'S PREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter an absence of twelve years, I visited the Mer de Glace last\r\nJune. It exhibited in a striking degree that excess of consumption\r\nover supply which, if continued, would eventually reduce the Swiss\r\nglaciers to the mere spectres of their former selves. When I first\r\nsaw the Mer de Glace its ice-cliffs towered over Les Mottets, and an\r\narm of the Arveiron, issuing from the cliffs, plunged as a powerful\r\ncascade down the rocks. The ice has now shrunk far behind them. A\r\nhuge moraine, left behind by the retreating glacier, will mark, for\r\nsome time to come, its recent magnitude. The vault of the Arveiron\r\nhas dwindled considerably. The way up to the Chapeau lies on the\r\ntop of a lateral moraine, reached a few years ago by the surface\r\nof the glacier, the present surface lying far below. The visible\r\nand continual breaking away of the moraines, left thus stranded on\r\nthe mountain flank, explains the absence of ancient ridges on the\r\nmountains where the slopes are steep. The ice-cascades of the Géant\r\nhas suffered much from the general waste. Its crevasses are still\r\nwild, but the ice-cliffs and séracs of former days are but poorly\r\nrepresented to-day.\r\n\r\nThe great Aletsch and its neighbours exhibit similar evidences of\r\ndiminution. I found moreover this year that the two ancient moraines\r\nmentioned in paragraph 364 are parts of the same great lateral\r\nmoraine which flanked the glacier for a long period, during which its\r\nmagnitude must have remained practically constant. The place occupied\r\nby the ancient ice-river is rendered strikingly conspicuous by this\r\nwell-preserved boundary.\r\n\r\nDuring my residence at the Bel Alp this year, a catastrophe occurred\r\nwhich renders, for the time being, the description of the Märgelin\r\nSee given in § 50 inappropriate. In company with two young friends I\r\nhad descended the glacier and passed through the gorge of the Massa.\r\nOn our return to the Bel Alp we found the domestics of the hotel\r\nleaning out of the windows and looking excitedly towards the glacier.\r\nFrom it proceeded a sound which resembled the roar of a cataract.\r\nThe servants remarked that the Märgelin See must have broken loose.\r\nThis was the case. For a time, however, the water flowed beneath the\r\nglacier; but at a point about midway between the Bel Alp and the\r\nÆggischhorn, it broke forth on the Æggischhorn side, and formed a\r\ntorrent between the glacier and the slope of the mountain. In some\r\nplaces this river was more than sixty yards wide, at others it was\r\ncontracted to less than one-fifth of this width. Broken cascades of\r\ngreat height were formed here and there by successive ledges of ice,\r\nthe torrent leaping with indescribable fury from ledge to ledge, and\r\nsending a smoke of spray into the air. At one place the bottom of\r\nthe torrent was deep soft sand, which, after the water had passed,\r\ncould be seen to have been tortured into huge funnels by the whirling\r\neddies overhead.\r\n\r\nSoon after we reached the Bel Alp, on the occasion just referred to,\r\nthe front of the torrent appeared at the opposite side of the valley\r\ncarrying everything movable before it, and immediately afterwards\r\nswept through the hollow that we had traversed a little earlier in\r\nthe day. When at the end of the glacier I was struck by the force and\r\nvolume of the Massa, and the grandeur of its vault, but I could not\r\nthen account for the huge blocks of ice which it incessantly carried\r\ndown. Doubtless the eruption above had been partial before the grand\r\nrush set in. The Rhone was considerably swollen, crops were damaged\r\nor ruined, and the driver of the diligence was sorely perplexed to\r\nfind himself in three feet of water, without any apparent reason,\r\non the public highway. Two or three days subsequently I learned\r\nat the Æggischhorn that an engineer had been sent up to report on\r\nthe possibility of opening a channel, so as to prevent any future\r\naccumulation of water in the Märgelin See. If this be done a useful\r\nend will be gained, by the abolition, however, of one of the most\r\nbeautiful objects in Switzerland.\r\n\r\n                                                         J. Tyndall.\r\n\r\n  _September, 1872._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE FOURTH EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt a meeting of the Managers of the Royal Institution held on\r\nDecember 12, 1825, \"the Committee appointed to consider what lectures\r\nshould be delivered in the Institution in the next session,\" reported\r\n\"that they had consulted Mr. Faraday on the subject of engaging him\r\nto take a part in the juvenile lectures proposed to be given during\r\nthe Christmas and Easter recesses, and they found his avocations were\r\nsuch that it would be exceedingly inconvenient for him to engage in\r\nsuch lectures.\"\r\n\r\nAt a general monthly meeting of the members of the Royal Institution,\r\nheld on December 4, 1826, the Managers reported \"that they had\r\nengaged Mr. Wallis to deliver a course of lectures on Astronomy,\r\nadapted to a juvenile auditory, during the Christmas vacation.\"\r\n\r\nIn a report dated April 16, 1827, the Board of Visitors express\r\n\"their satisfaction at finding that the plan of juvenile courses of\r\nlectures had been resorted to. They feel sure that the influence of\r\nthe Institution cannot be extended too far, and that the system of\r\ninstructing the younger portion of the community is one of the most\r\neffective means which the Institution possesses for the diffusion of\r\nscience.\"\r\n\r\nFaraday's holding aloof was but temporary, for at Christmas 1827 we\r\nfind him giving a \"Course of Six Elementary Lectures on Chemistry,\r\nadapted to a Juvenile Auditory.\"[A]\r\n\r\n[A] There is no record to show that Mr. Wallis gave the Astronomical\r\nlectures referred to, and our librarian believes that the _Christmas_\r\ncourses were opened by Faraday.\r\n\r\nThe Easter lectures were soon abandoned; but from the date here\r\nreferred to to the present time the Christmas lectures have been a\r\nmarked feature of the Royal Institution.\r\n\r\nIn 1871 it fell to my lot to give one of these courses. I had been\r\nfrequently invited to write on Glaciers in encyclopædias, journals,\r\nand magazines, but had always declined to do so. I had also abstained\r\nfrom making them the subject of a course of lectures, wishing to take\r\nno advantage of my position here, and indeed to avoid writing a line\r\nor uttering a sentence on the subject for which I could not be held\r\npersonally responsible. In view of the discussions which the subject\r\nhad provoked, I thought this the fairest course.\r\n\r\nBut, in 1871, the time (I imagined) had come when, without risk of\r\noffence, I might tell our young people something about the labours\r\nof those who had unravelled for their instruction the various\r\nproblems of the ice-world. My lamented friend and ever-helpful\r\ncounsellor, Dr. Bence Jones, thought the subject a good one, and\r\naccordingly it was chosen. Strong in my sympathy with youth, and\r\nremembering the damage done by defective exposition to my own young\r\nmind, I sought, to the best of my ability, to confer upon these\r\nlectures clearness, thoroughness, and life.\r\n\r\nWishing, moreover, to render them of permanent value, I wrote out\r\ncopious Notes of the course, and had them distributed among the boys\r\nand girls. In preparing these Notes I aimed at nothing less than\r\npresenting to my youthful audience, in a concentrated but perfectly\r\ndigestible form, every essential point embraced in the literature of\r\nthe glaciers, and some things in addition, which, derived as they\r\nwere from my own recent researches, no book previously published on\r\nthe subject contained.\r\n\r\nBut my theory of education agrees with that of Emerson, according\r\nto which instruction is only half the battle, what he calls\r\n_provocation_ being the other half. By this he means that power of\r\nthe teacher, through the force of his character and the vitality\r\nof his thought, to bring out all the latent strength of his pupil,\r\nand to invest with interest even the driest matters of detail. In\r\nthe present instance I was determined to shirk nothing essential,\r\nhowever dry; and, to keep my mind alive to the requirements of my\r\npupil, I proposed a series of ideal ramblings, in which he should be\r\nalways at my side. Oddly enough, though I was here dealing with what\r\nmight be called the abstract idea of a boy, I realised his presence\r\nso fully as to entertain for him, before our excursions ended, an\r\naffection consciously warm and real.\r\n\r\nThe \"Notes\" here referred to were at first intended for the use of my\r\naudience alone. At the urgent request of a friend I slightly expanded\r\nthem, and converted them into the little book here presented to the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\nThe amount of attention bestowed upon the volume induces me to give\r\nthis brief history of its origin.\r\n\r\nA German critic, whom I have no reason to regard as specially\r\nfavourable to me or it, makes the following remark on the style of\r\nthe book: \"This passion [for the mountains] tempts him frequently\r\nto reveal more of his Alpine wanderings than is necessary for\r\nhis demonstrations. The reader, however, will not find this a\r\ndisagreeable interruption of the course of thought; for the book\r\nthereby gains wonderfully in vividness.\" This, I would say, was the\r\nexpress aim of the breaks referred to. I desired to keep my companion\r\nfresh as well as instructed, and these interruptions were so many\r\nbreathing-places where the intellectual tension was purposely\r\nrelaxed and the mind of the pupil braced to fresh action.\r\n\r\nOf other criticisms, flattering and otherwise, I forbear to speak.\r\nAs regards some of them, indeed, it would be a reproach to that\r\nmanliness which I have sought to encourage in my pupil to return\r\nblow for blow. If the reader be acquainted with them, this will let\r\nhim know how I regard them; and if he be not acquainted with them,\r\nI would recommend him to ignore them, and to form his own judgment\r\nof this book. No fair-minded person who reads it will dream that I,\r\nin writing it, had a thought of acting otherwise than justly and\r\ngenerously towards my predecessors, the last of whom, to the grief of\r\nall who knew him, has recently passed away.\r\n\r\n                                                       John Tyndall.\r\n\r\n  _April, 1874._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Cloud-banner of the Aiguille du Dru                   _Frontispiece_\r\n\r\n                                                                  PAGE\r\n\r\n  § 1, 2.

Every occurrence in Nature is preceded by other occurrences which\r\nare its causes, and succeeded by others which are its effects. The\r\nhuman mind is not satisfied with observing and studying any natural\r\noccurrence alone, but takes pleasure in connecting every natural fact\r\nwith what has gone before it, and with what is to come after it.\r\n\r\n2. Thus, when we enter upon the study of rivers and glaciers, our\r\ninterest will be greatly augmented by taking into account not only\r\ntheir actual appearances, but also their causes and effects.\r\n\r\n3. Let us trace a river to its source. Beginning where it empties\r\nitself into the sea, and following it backwards, we find it from\r\ntime to time joined by tributaries which swell its waters. The river\r\nof course becomes smaller as these tributaries are passed. It shrinks\r\nfirst to a brook, then to a stream; this again divides itself into a\r\nnumber of smaller streamlets, ending in mere threads of water. These\r\nconstitute the source of the river, and are usually found among hills.\r\n\r\n4. Thus the Severn has its source in the Welsh Mountains; the Thames\r\nin the Cotswold Hills; the Danube in the hills of the Black Forest;\r\nthe Rhine and the Rhone in the Alps; the Ganges in the Himalaya\r\nMountains; the Euphrates near Mount Ararat; the Garonne in the\r\nPyrenees; the Elbe in the Giant Mountains of Bohemia; the Missouri in\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, and the Amazon in the Andes of Peru.\r\n\r\n5. But it is quite plain that we have not yet reached the real\r\nbeginning of the rivers. Whence do the earliest streams derive their\r\nwater? A brief residence among the mountains would prove to you that\r\nthey are fed by rains. In dry weather you would find the streams\r\nfeeble, sometimes indeed quite dried up. In wet weather you would see\r\nthem foaming torrents. In general these streams lose themselves as\r\nlittle threads of water upon the hill sides; but sometimes you may\r\ntrace a river to a definite spring. The river Albula in Switzerland,\r\nfor instance, rushes at its origin in considerable volume from a\r\nmountain side. But you very soon assure yourself that such springs\r\nare also fed by rain, which has percolated through the rocks or soil,\r\nand which, through some orifice that it has found or formed, comes to\r\nthe light of day.\r\n\r\n6. But we cannot end here. Whence comes the rain which forms the\r\nmountain streams? Observation enables you to answer the question.\r\nRain does not come from a clear sky. It comes from clouds. But what\r\nare clouds? Is there nothing you are acquainted with which they\r\nresemble? You discover at once a likeness between them and the\r\ncondensed steam of a locomotive. At every puff of the engine a cloud\r\nis projected into the air. Watch the cloud sharply: you notice that\r\nit first forms at a little distance from the top of the funnel. Give\r\nclose attention and you will sometimes see a perfectly clear space\r\nbetween the funnel and the cloud. Through that clear space the thing\r\nwhich makes the cloud must pass. What, then, is this thing which\r\nat one moment is transparent and invisible, and at the next moment\r\nvisible as a dense opaque cloud?\r\n\r\n7. It is the _steam_ or _vapour of water_ from the boiler. Within\r\nthe boiler this steam is transparent and invisible; but to keep it\r\nin this invisible state a heat would be required as great as that\r\nwithin the boiler. When the vapour mingles with the cold air above\r\nthe hot funnel it ceases to be vapour. Every bit of steam shrinks\r\nwhen chilled, to a much more minute particle of water. The liquid\r\nparticles thus produced form a kind of _water-dust_ of exceeding\r\nfineness, which floats in the air, and is called _a cloud_.\r\n\r\n8. Watch the cloud-banner from the funnel of a running locomotive;\r\nyou see it growing gradually less dense. It finally melts away\r\naltogether, and if you continue your observations you will not fail\r\nto notice that the speed of its disappearance depends upon the\r\ncharacter of the day. In humid weather the cloud hangs long and\r\nlazily in the air; in dry weather it is rapidly licked up. What has\r\nbecome of it? It has been reconverted into true invisible vapour.\r\n\r\n9. The _drier_ the air, and the _hotter_ the air, the greater is the\r\namount of cloud which can be thus dissolved in it. When the cloud\r\nfirst forms, its quantity is far greater than the air is able to\r\nmaintain in an invisible state. But as the cloud mixes gradually\r\nwith a larger mass of air it is more and more dissolved, and finally\r\npasses altogether from the condition of a finely-divided liquid into\r\nthat of transparent vapour or gas.\r\n\r\n10. Make the lid of a kettle air-tight, and permit the steam to issue\r\nfrom the pipe; a cloud is precipitated in all respects similar to\r\nthat issuing from the funnel of the locomotive.\r\n\r\n11. Permit the steam as it issues from the pipe to pass through the\r\nflame of a spirit-lamp, the cloud is instantly dissolved by the heat,\r\nand is not again precipitated. With a special boiler and a special\r\nnozzle the experiment may be made more striking, but not more\r\ninstructive, than with the kettle.\r\n\r\n12. Look to your bedroom windows when the weather is very cold\r\noutside; they sometimes stream with water derived from the\r\ncondensation of the aqueous vapour from your own lungs. The windows\r\nof railway carriages in winter show this condensation in a striking\r\nmanner. Pour cold water into a dry drinking-glass on a summer's day:\r\nthe outside surface of the glass becomes instantly dimmed by the\r\nprecipitation of moisture. On a warm day you notice no vapour in\r\nfront of your mouth, but on a cold day you form there a little cloud\r\nderived from the condensation of the aqueous vapour from the lungs.\r\n\r\n13. You may notice in a ball-room that as long as the door and\r\nwindows are kept closed, and the room remains hot, the air remains\r\nclear; but when the doors or windows are opened a dimness is visible,\r\ncaused by the precipitation to fog of the aqueous vapour of the\r\nball-room. If the weather be intensely cold the entrance of fresh\r\nair may even cause _snow_ to fall. This has been observed in Russian\r\nball-rooms; and also in the subterranean stables at Erzeroom, when\r\nthe doors are opened and the cold morning air is permitted to enter.\r\n\r\n14. Even on the driest day this vapour is never absent from our\r\natmosphere. The vapour diffused through the air of this room may be\r\ncongealed to hoar-frost in your presence. This is done by filling\r\na vessel with a mixture of pounded ice and salt, which is colder\r\nthan the ice itself, and which, therefore, condenses and freezes the\r\naqueous vapour. The surface of the vessel is finally coated with a\r\nfrozen fur, so thick that it may be scraped away and formed into a\r\nsnow-ball.\r\n\r\n15. To produce the cloud, in the case of the locomotive and the\r\nkettle, _heat_ is necessary. By heating the water we first convert\r\nit into steam, and then by chilling the steam we convert it into\r\ncloud. Is there any fire in nature which produces the clouds of our\r\natmosphere? There is: the fire of the sun.\r\n\r\n16. Thus, by tracing backward, without any break in the chain of\r\noccurrences, our river from its end to its real beginnings, we come\r\nat length to the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 2.\r\n\r\n17. There are, however, rivers which have sources somewhat different\r\nfrom those just mentioned. They do not begin by driblets on a hill\r\nside, nor can they be traced to a spring. Go, for example, to the\r\nmouth of the river Rhone, and trace it backwards to Lyons, where it\r\nturns to the east. Bending round by Chambery, you come at length\r\nto the Lake of Geneva, from which the river rushes, and which you\r\nmight be disposed to regard as the source of the Rhone. But go to\r\nthe head of the lake, and you find that the Rhone there enters it,\r\nthat the lake is in fact a kind of expansion of the river. Follow\r\nthis upwards; you find it joined by smaller rivers from the mountains\r\nright and left. Pass these, and push your journey higher still. You\r\ncome at length to a huge mass of ice the--end of a glacier--which\r\nfills the Rhone valley, and from the bottom of the glacier the river\r\nrushes. In the glacier of the Rhone you thus find the source of the\r\nriver Rhone.\r\n\r\n18. But again we have not reached the real beginning of the river.\r\nYou soon convince yourself that this earliest water of the Rhone is\r\nproduced by the melting of the ice. You get upon the glacier and walk\r\nupwards along it. After a time the ice disappears and you come upon\r\nsnow. If you are a competent mountaineer you may go to the very top\r\nof this great snow-field, and if you cross the top and descend at the\r\nother side you finally quit the snow, and get upon another glacier\r\ncalled the Trift, from the end of which rushes a river smaller than\r\nthe Rhone.\r\n\r\n19. You soon learn that the mountain snow feeds the glacier. By some\r\nmeans or other the snow is converted into ice. But whence comes the\r\nsnow? Like the rain, it comes from the clouds, which, as before, can\r\nbe traced to vapour raised by the sun. Without solar fire we could\r\nhave no atmospheric vapour, without vapour no clouds, without clouds\r\nno snow, and without snow no glaciers. Curious then as the conclusion\r\nmay be, the cold ice of the Alps has its origin in the heat of the\r\nsun.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 3. _The Waves of Light._\r\n\r\n20. But what is the sun? We know its size and its weight. We also\r\nknow that it is a globe of fire far hotter than any fire upon earth.\r\nBut we now enter upon another enquiry. We have to learn definitely\r\nwhat is the meaning of solar light and solar heat; in what way they\r\nmake themselves known to our senses; by what means they get from the\r\nsun to the earth, and how, when there, they produce the clouds of our\r\natmosphere, and thus originate our rivers and our glaciers.\r\n\r\n21. If in a dark room you close your eyes and press the eyelid\r\nwith your finger-nail, a circle of light will be seen opposite to\r\nthe point pressed, while a sharp blow upon the eye produces the\r\nimpression of a flash of light. There is a nerve specially devoted to\r\nthe purposes of vision which comes from the brain to the back of the\r\neye, and there divide into fine filaments, which are woven together\r\nto a kind of screen called the _retina_. The retina can be excited\r\nin various ways so as to produce the consciousness of light; it may,\r\nas we have seen, be excited by the rude mechanical action of a blow\r\nimparted to the eye.\r\n\r\n22. There is no spontaneous creation of light by the healthy eye.\r\nTo excite vision the retina must be affected by something coming\r\nfrom without. What is that something? In some way or other luminous\r\nbodies have the power of affecting the retina--but _how?_\r\n\r\n23. It was long supposed that from such bodies issued, with\r\ninconceivable rapidity, an inconceivably fine matter, which flew\r\nthrough space, passed through the pores supposed to exist in the\r\nhumours of the eye, reached the retina behind, and by their shock\r\nagainst the retina, aroused the sensation of light.\r\n\r\n24. This theory, which was supported by the greatest men, among\r\nothers by Sir Isaac Newton, was found competent to explain a great\r\nnumber of the phenomena of light, but it was not found competent\r\nto explain _all_ the phenomena. As the skill and knowledge of\r\nexperimenters increased, large classes of facts were revealed which\r\ncould only be explained by assuming that light was produced, not by a\r\nfine matter flying through space and hitting the retina, but by the\r\nshock of minute waves against the retina.\r\n\r\n25. Dip your finger into a basin of water, and cause it to quiver\r\nrapidly to and fro. From the point of disturbance issue small ripples\r\nwhich are carried forward by the water, and which finally strike the\r\nbasin. Here, in the vibrating finger, you have a source of agitation;\r\nin the water you have a vehicle through which the finger's motion\r\nis transmitted, and you have finally the side of the basin which\r\nreceives the shock of the little waves.\r\n\r\n26. In like manner, according to the _wave theory_ of light, you\r\nhave a source of agitation in the vibrating atoms, or smallest\r\nparticles, of the luminous body; you have a vehicle of transmission\r\nin a substance which is supposed to fill all space, and to be\r\ndiffused through the humours of the eye; and finally, you have the\r\nretina, which receives the successive shocks of the waves. These\r\nshocks are supposed to produce the sensation of light.\r\n\r\n27. We are here dealing for the most part with suppositions and\r\nassumptions merely. We have never seen the atoms of a luminous body,\r\nnor their motions. We have never seen the medium which transmits\r\ntheir motions, nor the waves of that medium. How, then, do we come to\r\nassume their existence?\r\n\r\n28. Before such an idea could have taken any real root in the human\r\nmind, it must have been well disciplined and prepared by observations\r\nand calculations of ordinary wave-motion. It was necessary to know\r\nhow both water-waves and sound-waves are formed and propagated. It\r\nwas above all things necessary to know how waves, passing through\r\nthe same medium, act upon each other. Thus disciplined, the mind was\r\nprepared to detect any resemblance presenting itself between the\r\naction of light and that of waves. Great classes of optical phenomena\r\naccordingly appeared which could be accounted for in the most\r\ncomplete and satisfactory manner by assuming them to be produced by\r\nwaves, and which could not be otherwise accounted for. It is because\r\nof its competence to explain all the phenomena of light that the wave\r\ntheory now receives universal acceptance on the part of scientific\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nLet me use an illustration. We infer from the flint implements\r\nrecently found in such profusion all over England and in other\r\ncountries that they were produced by men, and also that the Pyramids\r\nof Egypt were built by men, because, as far as our experience goes,\r\nnothing but men could form such implements or build such Pyramids.\r\nIn like manner, we infer from the phenomena of light the agency of\r\nwaves, because, as far as our experience goes, no other agency could\r\nproduce the phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 4. _The Waves of Heat which produce the Vapour of our Atmosphere\r\nand melt our Glaciers._\r\n\r\n29. Thus, in a general way, I have given you the conception and\r\nthe grounds of the conception, which regards light as the product\r\nof wave-motion; but we must go farther than this, and follow the\r\nconception into some of its details. We have all seen the waves of\r\nwater, and we know they are of different sizes different in length\r\nand different in height. When, therefore, you are told that the\r\natoms of the sun, and of almost all other luminous bodies, vibrate\r\nat different rates, and produce waves of different sizes, your\r\nexperience of water-waves will enable you to form a tolerably clear\r\nnotion of what is meant.\r\n\r\n30. As observed above, we have never seen the light-waves, but we\r\njudge of their presence, their position, and their magnitude, by\r\ntheir effects. Their lengths have been thus determined, and found to\r\nvary from about 1/30000th to 1/60000th of an inch.\r\n\r\n31. But besides those which produce light, the sun sends forth\r\nincessantly a multitude of waves which produce no light. The largest\r\nwaves which the sun sends forth are of this non-luminous character,\r\nthough they possess the highest heating power.\r\n\r\n32. A common sunbeam contains waves of all kinds, but it is possible\r\nto _sift_ or _filter_ the beam so as to intercept all its light, and\r\nto allow its obscure heat to pass unimpeded. For substances have been\r\ndiscovered which, while intensely opaque to the light-waves, are\r\nalmost perfectly transparent to the others. On the other hand, it is\r\npossible, by the choice of proper substances, to intercept in a great\r\ndegree the pure heat-waves, and to allow the pure light-waves free\r\ntransmission. This last separation is, however, not so perfect as the\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n33. We shall learn presently how to detach the one class of waves\r\nfrom the other class, and to prove that waves competent to light a\r\nfire, fuse metal, or burn the hand like a hot solid, may exist in a\r\nperfectly dark place.\r\n\r\n34. Supposing, then, that we withdraw, in the first instance the\r\nlarge heat-waves, and allow the light-waves alone to pass. These\r\nmay be concentrated by suitable lenses and sent into water without\r\nsensibly warming it. Let the light-waves now be withdrawn, and the\r\nlarger heat-waves concentrated in the same manner; they may be caused\r\nto boil the water almost instantaneously.\r\n\r\n35. This is the point to which I wished to lead you, and which\r\nwithout due preparation could not be understood. You now perceive the\r\nimportant part played by these large darkness-waves, if I may use\r\nthe term, in the work of evaporation. When they plunge into seas,\r\nlakes, and rivers, they are intercepted close to the surface, and\r\nthey heat the water at the surface, thus causing it to evaporate;\r\nthe light-waves at the same time entering to great depths without\r\nsensibly heating the water through which they pass. Not only,\r\ntherefore, is it the sun's fire which produces evaporation, but a\r\nparticular constituent of that fire, the existence of which you\r\nprobably were not aware of.\r\n\r\n36. Further, it is these selfsame lightless waves which, falling upon\r\nthe glaciers of the Alps, melt the ice and produce all the rivers\r\nflowing from the glaciers; for I shall prove to you presently that\r\nthe light-waves, even when concentrated to the uttermost, are unable\r\nto melt the most delicate hoar-frost; much less would they be able to\r\nproduce the copious liquefaction observed upon the glaciers.\r\n\r\n37. These large lightless waves of the sun, as well as the\r\nheat-waves issuing from non-luminous hot bodies, are frequently\r\ncalled obscure or invisible heat.\r\n\r\nWe have here an example of the manner in which phenomena, apparently\r\nremote, are connected together in this wonderful system of things\r\nthat we call Nature. You cannot study a snow-flake profoundly without\r\nbeing led back by it step by step to the constitution of the sun. It\r\nis thus throughout Nature. All its parts are interdependent, and the\r\nstudy of any one part completely would really involve the study of\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 5. _Experiments to prove the foregoing Statements._\r\n\r\n38. Heat issuing from any source not visibly red cannot be\r\nconcentrated so as to produce the intense effects just referred to.\r\nTo produce these it is necessary to employ the obscure heat of a body\r\nraised to the highest possible state of incandescence. The sun is\r\nsuch a body, and its dark heat is therefore suitable for experiments\r\nof this nature.\r\n\r\n39. But in the atmosphere of London, and for experiments such as\r\nours, the heat-waves emitted by coke raised to intense whiteness by a\r\ncurrent of electricity are much more manageable than the sun's waves.\r\nThe electric light has also the advantage that its dark radiation\r\nembraces a larger proportion of the total radiation than the dark\r\nheat of the sun. In fact, the force or energy, if I may use the term,\r\nof the dark waves of the electric light is fully seven times that of\r\nits light-waves. The electric light, therefore, shall be employed in\r\nour experimental demonstrations.\r\n\r\n40. From this source a powerful beam is sent through the room,\r\nrevealing its track by the motes floating in the air of the room; for\r\nwere the motes entirely absent the beam would be unseen. It falls\r\nupon a concave mirror (a glass one silvered behind will answer) and\r\nis gathered up by the mirror into a cone of reflected rays; the\r\nluminous apex of the cone, which is the _focus_ of the mirror, being\r\nabout fifteen inches distant from its reflecting surface. Let us mark\r\nthe focus accurately by a pointer.\r\n\r\n41. And now let us place in the path of the beam a substance\r\nperfectly opaque to light. This substance is iodine dissolved in a\r\nliquid called bisulphide of carbon. The light at the focus instantly\r\nvanishes when the dark solution is introduced. But the solution is\r\nintensely transparent to the dark waves, and a focus of such waves\r\nremains in the air of the room after the light has been abolished.\r\nYou may feel the heat of these waves with your hand; you may let them\r\nfall upon a thermometer, and thus prove their presence; or, best of\r\nall, you may cause them to produce a current of electricity, which\r\ndeflects a large magnetic needle. The magnitude of the deflection is\r\na measure of the heat.\r\n\r\n42. Our object now is, by the use of a more powerful lamp, and\r\na better mirror (one silvered in front and with a shorter focal\r\ndistance), to intensify the action here rendered so sensible. As\r\nbefore, the focus is rendered strikingly visible by the intense\r\nillumination of the dust particles. We will first filter the beam so\r\nas to intercept its dark waves, and then permit the purely luminous\r\nwaves to exert their utmost power on a small bundle of gun-cotton\r\nplaced at the focus.\r\n\r\n43. No effect whatever is produced. The gun-cotton might remain there\r\nfor a week without ignition. Let us now permit the unfiltered beam\r\nto act upon the cotton. It is instantly dissipated in an explosive\r\nflash. This experiment proves that the light-waves are incompetent to\r\nexplode the cotton, while the waves of the full beam are competent to\r\ndo so; hence we may conclude that the dark waves are the real agents\r\nin the explosion.\r\n\r\n44. But this conclusion would be only probable; for it might be urged\r\nthat the _mixture_ of the dark waves and the light-waves is necessary\r\nto produce the result. Let us then, by means of our opaque solution,\r\nisolate our dark waves and converge them on the cotton. It explodes\r\nas before.\r\n\r\n45. Hence it is the dark waves, and they only, that are concerned in\r\nthe ignition of the cotton.\r\n\r\n46. At the same dark focus sheets of platinum are raised to vivid\r\nredness; zinc is burnt up; paper instantly blazes; magnesium wire is\r\nignited; charcoal within a receiver containing oxygen is set burning;\r\na diamond similarly placed is caused to glow like a star, being\r\nafterward gradually dissipated. And all this while the _air_ at the\r\nfocus remains as cool as in any other part of the room.\r\n\r\n47. To obtain the light-waves we employ a clear solution of alum in\r\nwater; to obtain the dark waves we employ the solution of iodine\r\nabove referred to. But as before stated (32), the alum is not so\r\nperfect a filter as the iodine; for it transmits a portion of the\r\nobscure heat.\r\n\r\n48. Though the light-waves here prove their incompetence to ignite\r\ngun-cotton, they are able to burn up black paper; or, indeed, to\r\nexplode the cotton when it is blackened. The white cotton does not\r\nabsorb the light, and without absorption we have no heating. The\r\nblackened cotton absorbs, is heated, and explodes.\r\n\r\n49. Instead of a solution of alum, we will employ for our next\r\nexperiment a cell of pure water, through which the light passes\r\nwithout sensible absorption. At the focus is placed a test-tube also\r\ncontaining water, the full force of the light being concentrated upon\r\nit. The water is not sensibly warmed by the concentrated waves. We\r\nnow remove the cell of water; no change is visible in the beam, but\r\nthe water contained in the test-tube now boils.\r\n\r\n50. The light-waves being thus proved ineffectual, and the full beam\r\neffectual, we may infer that it is the dark waves that do the work of\r\nheating. But we clench our inference by employing our opaque iodine\r\nfilter. Placing it on the path of the beam, the light is entirely\r\nstopped, but the water boils exactly as it did when the full beam\r\nfell upon it.\r\n\r\n51. The truth of the statement made in paragraph (34) is thus\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\n52. And now with regard to the melting of ice. On the surface of\r\na flask containing a freezing mixture we obtain a thick fur of\r\nhoar-frost. Sending the beam through a water-cell, its luminous waves\r\nare concentrated upon the surface of the flask. Not a spicula of the\r\nfrost is dissolved. We now remove the water-cell, and in a moment a\r\npatch of the frozen fur as large as half-a-crown is melted. Hence,\r\ninasmuch as the full beam produces this effect, and the luminous part\r\nof the beam does not produce it, we fix upon the dark portion the\r\nmelting of the frost.\r\n\r\n53. As before, we clench this inference by concentrating the dark\r\nwaves alone upon the flask. The frost is dissipated exactly as it was\r\nby the full beam.\r\n\r\n54. These effects are rendered strikingly visible by darkening with\r\nink the freezing mixture within the flask. When the hoar-frost is\r\nremoved, the blackness of the surface from which it had been melted\r\ncomes out in strong contrast with the adjacent snowy whiteness. When\r\nthe flask itself, instead of the freezing mixture, is blackened, the\r\npurely luminous waves being absorbed by the glass, warm it; the glass\r\nreacts upon the frost, and melts it. Hence the wisdom of darkening,\r\ninstead of the flask itself, the mixture within the flask.\r\n\r\n55. This experiment proves to demonstration the statement in\r\nparagraph (36): that it is the dark waves of the sun that melt the\r\nmountain snow and ice, and originate all the rivers derived from\r\nglaciers.\r\n\r\nThere are writers who seem to regard science as an aggregate of\r\nfacts, and hence doubt its efficacy as an exercise of the reasoning\r\npowers. But all that I have here taught you is the result of reason,\r\ntaking its stand, however, upon the sure basis of observation and\r\nexperiment. And this is the spirit in which our further studies are\r\nto be pursued.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 6. _Oceanic Distillation._\r\n\r\n56. The sun, you know, is never exactly overhead in England. But at\r\nthe equator, and within certain limits north and south of it, the sun\r\nat certain periods of the year is directly overhead at noon. These\r\nlimits are called the Tropics of Cancer and of Capricorn. Upon the\r\nbelt comprised between these two circles the sun's rays fall with\r\ntheir mightiest power; for here they shoot directly downward, and\r\nheat both earth and sea more than when they strike slantingly.\r\n\r\n57. When the vertical sunbeams strike the land they heat it, and the\r\nair in contact with the hot soil becomes heated in turn. But when\r\nheated the air expands, and when it expands it becomes lighter. This\r\nlighter air rises, like wood plunged into water, through the heavier\r\nair overhead.\r\n\r\n58. When the sunbeams fall upon the sea the water is warmed, though\r\nnot so much as the land. The warmed water expands, becomes thereby\r\nlighter, and therefore continues to float upon the top. This upper\r\nlayer of water warms to some extent the air in contact with it,\r\nbut it also sends up a quantity of aqueous vapour, which being far\r\nlighter than air, helps the latter to rise. Thus both from the land\r\nand from the sea we have ascending currents established by the action\r\nof the sun.\r\n\r\n59. When they reach a certain elevation in the atmosphere, these\r\ncurrents divide and flow, part towards the north and part towards\r\nthe south; while from the north and the south a flow of heavier and\r\ncolder air sets in to supply the place of the ascending warm air.\r\n\r\n60. Incessant circulation is thus established in the atmosphere. The\r\nequatorial air and vapour flow above towards the north and south\r\npoles, while the polar air flows below towards the equator. The two\r\ncurrents of air thus established are called the upper and the lower\r\ntrade winds.\r\n\r\n61. But before the air returns from the poles great changes have\r\noccurred. For the air as it quitted the equatorial regions was laden\r\nwith aqueous vapour, which could not subsist in the cold polar\r\nregions. It is there precipitated, falling sometimes as rain, or\r\nmore commonly as snow. The land near the pole is covered with this\r\nsnow, which gives birth to vast glaciers in a manner hereafter to be\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n62. It is necessary that you should have a perfectly clear view of\r\nthis process, for great mistakes have been made regarding the manner\r\nin which glaciers are related to the heat of the sun.\r\n\r\n63. It was supposed that if the sun's heat were diminished, greater\r\nglaciers than those now existing would be produced. But the lessening\r\nof the sun's heat would infallibly diminish the quantity of aqueous\r\nvapour, and thus cut off the glaciers at their source. A brief\r\nillustration will complete your knowledge here.\r\n\r\n64. In the process of ordinary distillation, the liquid to be\r\ndistilled is heated and converted into vapour in one vessel, and\r\nchilled and reconverted into liquid in another. What has just been\r\nstated renders it plain that the earth and its atmosphere constitute\r\na vast distilling apparatus in which the equatorial ocean plays the\r\npart of the boiler, and the chill regions of the poles the part of\r\nthe condenser. In this process of distillation _heat_ plays quite as\r\nnecessary a part as _cold_, and before Bishop Heber could speak of\r\n\"Greenland's icy mountains,\" the equatorial ocean had to be warmed by\r\nthe sun. We shall have more to say upon this question afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustrative Experiments.\r\n\r\n65. I have said that when heated, air expands. If you wish to verify\r\nthis for yourself, proceed thus. Take an empty flask, stop it by a\r\ncork; pass through the cork a narrow glass tube. By heating the tube\r\nin a spirit-lamp you can bend it downwards, so that when the flask is\r\nstanding upright the open end of the narrow tube may dip into water.\r\nNow cause the flame of your spirit-lamp to play against the flask.\r\nThe flame heats the glass, the glass heats the air; the air expands,\r\nis driven through the narrow tube, and issues in a storm of bubbles\r\nfrom the water.\r\n\r\n66. Were the heated air unconfined, it would rise in the heavier\r\ncold air. Allow a sunbeam or any other intense light to fall upon a\r\nwhite wall or screen in a dark room. Bring a heated poker, a candle,\r\nor a gas flame underneath the beam. An ascending current rises from\r\nthe heated body through the beam, and the action of the air upon the\r\nlight is such as to render the wreathing and waving of the current\r\nstrikingly visible upon the screen. When the air is hot enough, and\r\ntherefore light enough, if entrapped in a paper bag it carries the\r\nbag upwards, and you have the Fire-balloon.\r\n\r\n67. Fold two sheets of paper into two cones and suspend them with\r\ntheir closed points upwards from the end of a delicate balance. See\r\nthat the cones balance each other. Then place for a moment the flame\r\nof a spirit-lamp beneath the open base of one of them; the hot air\r\nascends from the lamp and instantly tosses upwards the cone above it.\r\n\r\n68. Into an inverted glass shade introduce a little smoke. Let the\r\nair come to rest, and then simply place your hand at the open mouth\r\nof the shade. Mimic hurricanes are produced by the air warmed by the\r\nhand, which are strikingly visible when the smoke is illuminated by a\r\nstrong light.\r\n\r\n69. The heating of the tropical air by the sun is _indirect_. The\r\nsolar beams have scarcely any power to heat the air through which\r\nthey pass; but they heat the land and ocean, and these communicate\r\ntheir heat to the air in contact with them. The air and vapour start\r\nupwards charged with the heat thus communicated.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 7. _Tropical Rains._\r\n\r\n70. But long before the air and vapour from the equator reach the\r\npoles, precipitation occurs. Wherever a humid warm wind mixes with a\r\ncold dry one, rain falls. Indeed the heaviest rains occur at those\r\nplaces where the sun is vertically overhead. We must enquire a little\r\nmore closely into their origin.\r\n\r\n71. Fill a bladder about two-thirds full of air at the sea level,\r\nand take it to the summit of Mont Blanc. As you ascend, the bladder\r\nbecomes more and more distended; at the top of the mountain it is\r\nfully distended, and has evidently to bear a pressure from within.\r\nReturning to the sea level you find that the tightness disappears,\r\nthe bladder finally appearing as flaccid as at first.\r\n\r\n72. The reason is plain. At the sea level the air within the\r\nbladder has to bear the pressure of the whole atmosphere, being\r\nthereby squeezed into a comparatively small volume. In ascending\r\nthe mountain, you leave more and more of the atmosphere behind; the\r\npressure becomes less and less, and by its expansive force the air\r\nwithin the bladder swells as the outside pressure is diminished. At\r\nthe top of the mountain the expansion is quite sufficient to render\r\nthe bladder tight, the pressure within being then actually greater\r\nthan the pressure without. By means of an air-pump we can show the\r\nexpansion of a balloon partly filled with air, when the external\r\npressure has been in part removed.\r\n\r\n73. But why do I dwell upon this? Simply to make plain to you that\r\nthe _unconfined air_, heated at the earth's surface, and ascending by\r\nits lightness, must expand more and more the higher it rises in the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n74. And now I have to introduce to you a new fact, towards the\r\nstatement of which I have been working for some time. It is this:\r\n_The ascending air is chilled by its expansion._ Indeed this chilling\r\nis one source of the coldness of the higher atmospheric regions. And\r\nnow fix your eye upon those mixed currents of air and aqueous vapour\r\nwhich rise from the warm tropical ocean. They start with plenty of\r\nheat to preserve the vapour as vapour; but as they rise they come\r\ninto regions already chilled, and they are still further chilled by\r\ntheir own expansion. The consequence might be foreseen. The load of\r\nvapour is in great part precipitated, dense clouds are formed, their\r\nparticles coalesce to rain-drops, which descend daily in gushes so\r\nprofuse that the word \"torrential\" is used to express the copiousness\r\nof the rainfall. I could show you this chilling by expansion, and\r\nalso the consequent precipitation of clouds.\r\n\r\n75. Thus long before the air from the equator reaches the poles\r\nits vapour is in great part removed from it, having redescended to\r\nthe earth as rain. Still a good quantity of the vapour is carried\r\nforward, which yields hail, rain, and snow in northern and southern\r\nlands.\r\n\r\n\r\nIllustrative Experiments.\r\n\r\n76. I have said that the air is chilled during its expansion. Prove\r\nthis, if you like, thus. With a condensing syringe, you can force air\r\ninto an iron box furnished with a stopcock, to which the syringe is\r\nscrewed. Do so till the density of the air within the box is doubled\r\nor trebled. Immediately after this condensation, both the box and\r\nthe air within it are warm, and can be proved to be so by a proper\r\nthermometer. Simply turn the cock and allow the compressed air to\r\nstream into the atmosphere. The current, if allowed to strike the\r\nthermometer, visibly chills it; and with other instruments the chill\r\nmay be made more evident still. Even the hand feels the chill of the\r\nexpanding air.\r\n\r\n77. Throw a strong light, a concentrated sunbeam for example, across\r\nthe issuing current; if the compressed air be ordinary humid air, you\r\nsee the precipitation of a little cloud by the chill accompanying the\r\nexpansion. This cloud-formation may, however, be better illustrated\r\nin the following way:--\r\n\r\n78. In a darkened room send a strong beam of light through a glass\r\ntube three feet long and three inches wide, stopped at its ends by\r\nglass plates. Connect the tube by means of a stopcock with a vessel\r\nof about one-fourth its capacity, from which the air has been removed\r\nby an air-pump. The exhausted cylinder of the pump itself will answer\r\ncapitally. Fill the glass tube with humid air; then simply turn on\r\nthe stopcock which connects it with the exhausted vessel. Having\r\nmore room the air expands, cold accompanies the expansion, and, as a\r\nconsequence, a dense and brilliant cloud immediately fills the tube.\r\nIf the experiment be made for yourself alone you may see the cloud\r\nin ordinary daylight; indeed, the brisk exhaustion of any receiver\r\nfilled with humid air is known to produce this condensation.\r\n\r\n79. Other vapours than that of water may be thus precipitated,\r\nsome of them yielding clouds of intense brilliancy, and displaying\r\niridescences, such as are sometimes, but not frequently, seen in the\r\nclouds floating over the Alps.\r\n\r\n80. In science what is true for the small is true for the large. Thus\r\nby combining the conditions observed on a large scale in nature we\r\nobtain on a small scale the phenomena of atmospheric clouds.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 8. _Mountain Condensers._\r\n\r\n81. To complete our view of the process of atmospheric precipitation\r\nwe must take into account the action of mountains. Imagine a\r\nsouth-west wind blowing across the Atlantic towards Ireland. In\r\nits passage it charges itself with aqueous vapour. In the south of\r\nIreland it encounters the mountains of Kerry: the highest of these\r\nis Magillicuddy's Reeks, near Killarney. Now the lowest stratum of\r\nthis Atlantic wind is that which is most fully charged with vapour.\r\nWhen it encounters the base of the Kerry mountains it is tilted up\r\nand flows bodily over them. Its load of vapour is therefore carried\r\nto a height, it expands on reaching the height, it is chilled in\r\nconsequence of the expansion, and comes down in copious showers\r\nof rain. From this, in fact, arises the luxuriant vegetation of\r\nKillarney; to this, indeed, the lakes owe their water supply. The\r\ncold crests of the mountains also aid in the work of condensation.\r\n\r\n82. Note the consequence. There is a town called Cahirciveen to\r\nthe south-west of Magillicuddy's Reeks, at which observations of\r\nthe rainfall have been made, and a good distance farther to the\r\nnorth-east, right in the course of the south-west wind, there is\r\nanother town, called Portarlington, at which observations of rainfall\r\nhave also been made. But before the wind reaches the latter station\r\nit has passed over the mountains of Kerry and left a great portion of\r\nits moisture behind it. What is the result? At Cahirciveen, as shown\r\nby Dr. Lloyd, the rainfall amounts to 59 inches in a year, while at\r\nPortarlington it is only 21 inches.\r\n\r\n83. Again, you may sometimes descend from the Alps when the fall of\r\nrain and snow is heavy and incessant, into Italy, and find the sky\r\nover the plains of Lombardy blue and cloudless, the wind at the same\r\ntime _blowing over the plain towards the Alps_. Below the wind is hot\r\nenough to keep its vapour in a perfectly transparent state; but it\r\nmeets the mountains, is tilted up, expanded, and chilled. The cold of\r\nthe higher summits also helps the chill. The consequence is that the\r\nvapour is precipitated as rain or snow, thus producing bad weather\r\nupon the heights, while the plains below, flooded with the same air,\r\nenjoy the aspect of the unclouded summer sun. Clouds blowing _from_\r\nthe Alps are also sometimes dissolved over the plains of Lombardy.\r\n\r\n84. In connection with the formation of clouds by mountains, one\r\nparticularly instructive effect may be here noticed. You frequently\r\nsee a streamer of cloud many hundred yards in length drawn out from\r\nan Alpine peak. Its steadiness appears perfect, though a strong\r\nwind may be blowing at the same time over the mountain head. Why\r\nis the cloud not blown away? It is blown away; its permanence is\r\nonly apparent. At one end it is incessantly dissolved, at the other\r\nend it is incessantly renewed: supply and consumption being thus\r\nequalized, the cloud appears as changeless as the mountain to which\r\nit seems to cling. When the red sun of the evening shines upon these\r\ncloud-streamers they resemble vast torches with their flames blown\r\nthrough the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 9. _Architecture of Snow._\r\n\r\n85. We now resemble persons who have climbed a difficult peak,\r\nand thereby earned the enjoyment of a wide prospect. Having made\r\nourselves masters of the conditions necessary to the production of\r\nmountain snow, we are able to take a comprehensive and intelligent\r\nview of the phenomena of glaciers.\r\n\r\n86. A few words are still necessary as to the formation of snow. The\r\nmolecules and atoms of all substances, when allowed free play, build\r\nthemselves into definite and, for the most part, beautiful forms\r\ncalled crystals. Iron, copper, gold, silver, lead, sulphur, when\r\nmelted and permitted to cool gradually, all show this crystallizing\r\npower. The metal bismuth shows it in a particularly striking manner,\r\nand when properly fused and solidified, self-built crystals of great\r\nsize and beauty are formed of this metal.\r\n\r\n87. If you dissolve saltpetre in water, and allow the solution to\r\nevaporate slowly, you may obtain large crystals, for no portion of\r\nthe salt is converted into vapour. The water of our atmosphere is\r\nfresh though it is derived from the salt sea. Sugar dissolved in\r\nwater, and permitted to evaporate, yields crystals of sugar-candy.\r\nAlum readily crystallizes in the same way. Flints dissolved, as they\r\nsometimes are in nature, and permitted to crystallize, yield the\r\nprisms and pyramids of rock crystal. Chalk dissolved and crystallized\r\nyields Iceland spar. The diamond is crystallized carbon. All our\r\nprecious stones, the ruby, sapphire, beryl, topaz, emerald, are all\r\nexamples of this crystallizing power.\r\n\r\n88. You have heard of the force of gravitation, and you know that\r\nit consists of an attraction of every particle of matter for every\r\nother particle. You know that planets and moons are held in their\r\norbits by this attraction. But gravitation is a very simple affair\r\ncompared to the force, or rather forces, of crystallization. For here\r\nthe ultimate particles of matter, inconceivably small as they are,\r\nshow themselves possessed of attractive and repellent poles, by the\r\nmutual action of which the shape and structure of the crystal are\r\ndetermined. In the solid condition the attracting poles are rigidly\r\nlocked together; but if sufficient heat be applied the bond of union\r\nis dissolved, and in the state of fusion the poles are pushed so far\r\nasunder as to be practically out of each other's range. The natural\r\ntendency of the molecules to build themselves together is thus\r\nneutralized.\r\n\r\n89. This is the case with water, which as a liquid is to all\r\nappearance formless. When sufficiently cooled the molecules are\r\nbrought within the play of the crystallizing force, and they then\r\narrange themselves in forms of indescribable beauty. When snow\r\nis produced in calm air, the icy particles build themselves into\r\nbeautiful stellar shapes, each star possessing six rays. There is no\r\ndeviation from this type, though in other respects the appearances\r\nof the snow-stars are infinitely various. In the polar regions these\r\nexquisite forms were observed by Dr. Scoresby, who gave numerous\r\ndrawings of them. I have observed them in mid-winter filling the air,\r\nand loading the slopes of the Alps. But in England they are also to\r\nbe seen, and no words of mine could convey so vivid an impression of\r\ntheir beauty as the annexed drawings of a few of them, executed at\r\nGreenwich by Mr. Glaisher.\r\n\r\n90. It is worth pausing to think what wonderful work is going on in\r\nthe atmosphere during the formation and descent of every snow-shower:\r\nwhat building power is brought into play! and how imperfect seem the\r\nproductions of human minds and hands when compared with those formed\r\nby the blind forces of nature!\r\n\r\n91. But who ventures to call the forces of nature blind? In reality,\r\nwhen we speak thus we are describing our own condition. The blindness\r\nis ours; and what we really ought to say, and to confess, is that our\r\npowers are absolutely unable to comprehend either the origin or the\r\nend of the operations of nature.\r\n\r\n92. But while we thus acknowledge our limits, there is also reason\r\nfor wonder at the extent to which science has mastered the system\r\nof nature. From age to age, and from generation to generation, fact\r\nhas been added to fact, and law to law, the true method and order\r\nof the Universe being thereby more and more revealed. In doing this\r\nscience has encountered and overthrown various forms of superstition\r\nand deceit, of credulity and imposture. But the world continually\r\nproduces weak persons and wicked persons; and as long as they\r\ncontinue to exist side by side, as they do in this our day, very\r\ndebasing beliefs will also continue to infest the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 10. _Atomic Poles._\r\n\r\n93. \"What did I mean when, a few moments ago (88), I spoke of\r\nattracting and repellent poles?\" Let me try to answer this question.\r\nYou know that astronomers and geographers speak of the earth's poles,\r\nand you have also heard of magnetic poles, the poles of a magnet\r\nbeing the points at which the attraction and repulsion of the magnet\r\nare as it were concentrated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SNOW CRYSTALS.]\r\n\r\n94. Every magnet possesses, two such poles; and if iron filings be\r\nscattered over a magnet, each particle becomes also endowed with\r\ntwo poles. Suppose such particles devoid of weight and floating in\r\nour atmosphere, what must occur when they come near each other?\r\nManifestly the repellent poles will retreat from each other, while\r\nthe attractive poles will approach and finally lock themselves\r\ntogether. And supposing the particles, instead of a single pair, to\r\npossess several pairs of poles arranged at definite points over their\r\nsurfaces; you can then picture them, in obedience to their mutual\r\nattractions and repulsions, building themselves together to form\r\nmasses of definite shape and structure.\r\n\r\n95. Imagine the molecules of water in calm cold air to be gifted\r\nwith poles of this description, which compel the particles to lay\r\nthemselves together in a definite order, and you have before your\r\nmind's eye the unseen architecture which finally produces the\r\nvisible and beautiful crystals of the snow. Thus our first notions\r\nand conceptions of poles are obtained from the sight of our eyes\r\nin looking at the effects of magnetism; and we then transfer these\r\nnotions and conceptions to particles which no eye has ever seen. The\r\npower by which we thus picture to ourselves effects beyond the range\r\nof the senses is what philosophers call the Imagination, and in the\r\neffort of the mind to seize upon the unseen architecture of crystals,\r\nwe have an example of the \"scientific use\" of this faculty. Without\r\nimagination we might have _critical_ power, but not _creative_ power\r\nin science.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 11. _Architecture of Lake Ice._\r\n\r\n96. We have thus made ourselves acquainted with the beautiful\r\nsnow-flowers self-constructed by the molecules of water in calm cold\r\nair. Do the molecules show this architectural power when ordinary\r\nwater is frozen? What, for example, is the structure of the ice over\r\nwhich we skate in winter? Quite as wonderful as the flowers of the\r\nsnow. The observation is rare, if not new, but I have seen in water\r\nslowly freezing six-rayed ice-stars formed, and floating free on the\r\nsurface. A six-rayed star, moreover, is typical of the construction\r\nof all our lake ice. It is built up of such forms wonderfully\r\ninterlaced.\r\n\r\n97. Take a slab of lake ice and place it in the path of a\r\nconcentrated sunbeam. Watch the track of the beam through the ice.\r\nPart of the beam is stopped, part of it goes through; the former\r\nproduces internal liquefaction, the latter has no effect whatever\r\nupon the ice. But the liquefaction is not uniformly diffused. From\r\nseparate spots of the ice little shining points are seen to sparkle\r\nforth. Every one of those points is surrounded by a beautiful liquid\r\nflower with six petals.\r\n\r\n98. Ice and water are so optically alike that unless the light fall\r\nproperly upon these flowers you cannot see them. But what is the\r\ncentral spot? A vacuum. Ice swims on water because, bulk for bulk,\r\nit is lighter than water; so that when ice is melted it shrinks in\r\nsize. Can the liquid flowers then occupy the whole space of the ice\r\nmelted? Plainly no. A little empty space is formed with the flowers,\r\nand this space, or rather its surface, shines in the sun with the\r\nlustre of burnished silver.\r\n\r\n99. In all cases the flowers are formed parallel to the surface of\r\nfreezing. They are formed when the sun shines upon the ice of every\r\nlake; sometimes in myriads, and so small as to require a magnifying\r\nglass to see them. They are always attainable, but their beauty is\r\noften marred by internal defects of the ice. Even one portion of the\r\nsame piece of ice may show them exquisitely, while the second portion\r\nshows them imperfectly.\r\n\r\n100. Annexed is a very imperfect sketch of these beautiful figures.\r\n\r\n101. Here we have a reversal of the process of crystallization. The\r\nsearching solar beam is delicate enough to take the molecules down\r\nwithout deranging the order of their architecture. Try the experiment\r\nfor yourself with a pocket-lens on a sunny day. You will not find the\r\nflowers confused; they all lie parallel to the surface of freezing.\r\nIn this exquisite way every bit of the ice over which our skaters\r\nglide in winter is put together.\r\n\r\n102. I said in (97) that a portion of the sunbeam was stopped by the\r\nice and liquefied it. What is this portion? The dark heat of the\r\nsun. The great body of the light waves and even a portion of the dark\r\nones, pass through the ice without losing any of their heating power.\r\nWhen properly concentrated on combustible bodies, even after having\r\npassed through the ice, their burning power becomes manifest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LIQUID FLOWERS IN LAKE ICE.]\r\n\r\n103. And the ice itself may be employed to concentrate them. With an\r\nice-lens in the polar regions Dr. Scoresby has often concentrated the\r\nsun's rays so as to make them burn wood, fire gunpowder, and melt\r\nlead; thus proving that the heating power is retained by the rays,\r\neven after they have passed through so cold a substance.\r\n\r\n104. By rendering the rays of the electric lamp parallel, and then\r\nsending them through a lens of ice, we obtain all the effects which\r\nDr. Scoresby obtained with the rays of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 12. _The Source of the Arveiron. Ice Pinnacles, Towers, and Chasms\r\nof the Glacier des Bois. Passage to the Montanvert._\r\n\r\n105. Our preparatory studies are for the present ended, and thus\r\ninformed, let us approach the Alps. Through the village of Chamouni,\r\nin Savoy, a river rushes which is called the Arve. Let us trace this\r\nriver backwards from Chamouni. At a little distance from the village\r\nthe river forks; one of its branches still continues to be called\r\nthe Arve, the other is the Arveiron. Following this latter we come\r\nto what is called the \"source of the Arveiron\"--a short hour's walk\r\nfrom Chamouni. Here, as in the case of the Rhone already referred\r\nto, you are fronted by a huge mass of ice, the end of a glacier, and\r\nfrom an arch in the ice the Arveiron issues. Do not trust the arch in\r\nsummer. Its roof falls at intervals with a startling crash, and would\r\ninfallibly crush any person on whom it might fall.\r\n\r\n106. We must now be observant. Looking about us here, we find in\r\nfront of the ice curious heaps and ridges of débris, which are more\r\nor less concentric. These are the _terminal moraines_ of the glacier.\r\nWe shall examine them subsequently.\r\n\r\n107. We now turn to the left, and ascend the slope beside the\r\nglacier. As we ascend we get a better view, and find that the ice\r\nhere fills a narrow valley. We come upon another singular ridge,\r\nnot of fresh débris, like those lower down, but covered in part\r\nwith trees, and appearing to be literally as \"old as the hills.\" It\r\ntells a wonderful tale. We soon satisfy ourselves that the ridge is\r\nan ancient moraine, and at once conclude that the glacier, at some\r\nformer period of its existence, was vastly larger than it is now.\r\nThis old moraine stretches right across the main valley, and abuts\r\nagainst the mountains at the opposite side.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOURCE OF THE ARVEIRON.]\r\n\r\n108. Having passed the terminal portion of the glacier, which is\r\ncovered with stones and rubbish, we find ourselves beside a very\r\nwonderful exhibition of ice. The glacier descends a steep gorge, and\r\nin doing so is riven and broken in the most extraordinary manner.\r\nHere are towers, and pinnacles, and fantastic shapes wrought out by\r\nthe action of the weather, which put one in mind of rude sculpture.\r\nAnnexed is a sketch of an ice-pinnacle. From deep chasms in the\r\nglacier issues a delicate shimmer of blue light. At times we hear a\r\nsound like thunder, which arises either from the falling of a tower\r\nof ice, or from the tumble of a huge stone into a chasm. The glacier\r\nmaintains this wild and chaotic character for some time; and the best\r\niceman would find himself defeated in any attempt to get along it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ICE-PINNACLE.]\r\n\r\n109. We reach a place called the Chapeau, where, if we wish, we can\r\nhave refreshment in a little mountain hut. We then pass the _Mauvais\r\nPas_, a precipitous rock, on the face of which steps are hewn, and\r\nthe unpractised traveller is assisted by a rope. We pursue our\r\njourney, partly along the mountain side, and partly along a ridge of\r\nsingularly artificial aspect a _lateral moraine_. We at length face a\r\nhouse perched upon an eminence at the opposite side of the glacier.\r\nThis is the auberge of the Montanvert, well known to all visitors to\r\nthis portion of the Alps.\r\n\r\n110. Here we cross the glacier. I should have told you that its lower\r\npart, including the broken portion we have passed, is called the\r\nGlacier des Bois; while the place that we are now about to cross is\r\nthe beginning of the Mer de Glace. You feel that this term is not\r\nquite appropriate, for the glacier here is much more like a _river_\r\nof ice than a sea. The valley which it fills is about half a mile\r\nwide.\r\n\r\n111. The ice may be riven where we enter upon it, but with the\r\nnecessary care there is no difficulty in crossing this portion\r\nof the Mer de Glace. The clefts and chasms in the ice are called\r\n_crevasses_; we shall make their acquaintance on a grander scale by\r\nand by.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MER DE GLACE, SHOWING MONT TACUL AND THE GRANDE\r\nJORASSE, WITH OUR CLEFT ABOVE TRÉLEPORTE TO THE RIGHT.]\r\n\r\n112. Look up and down this side of the glacier. It is considerably\r\nriven, but as we advance the crevasses will diminish, and we shall\r\nfind very few of them at the other side. Note this for future use.\r\nThe ice is at first dirty; but the dirt soon disappears, and you come\r\nupon the clean crisp surface of the glacier. You have already noticed\r\nthat the clean ice is white, and that from a distance it resembles\r\nsnow rather than ice. This is caused by the breaking up of the\r\nsurface by the solar heat. When you pound transparent rock-salt into\r\npowder it is as white as table-salt, and it is the minute fissuring\r\nof the surface of the glacier by the sun's rays that causes it to\r\nappear white. _Within_ the glacier the ice is transparent. After an\r\nexhilarating passage we get upon the opposite lateral moraine, and\r\nascend the steep slope from it to the Montanvert Inn.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 13. _The Mer de Glace and its Sources. Our First Climb to the Cleft\r\nStation._\r\n\r\n113. Here the view before us is very grand. We look across the\r\nglacier at the beautiful pyramid of the Aiguille du Dru (shown in our\r\nfrontispiece); and to the right at the Aiguille des Charmoz, with\r\nits sharp pinnacles bent as if they were ductile. Looking straight\r\nup the glacier the view is bounded by the great crests called La\r\nGrande Jorasse, nearly 14,000 feet high. Our object now is to get\r\ninto the very heart of the mountains, and to pursue to its origin the\r\nwonderful frozen river which we have just crossed.\r\n\r\n114. Starting from the Montanvert with, the glacier below us to our\r\nleft, we soon reach some rocks resembling the Mauvais Pas; they are\r\ncalled _les Fonts_. We cross them and reach _l'Angle_, where we quit\r\nthe land for the ice. We walk up the glacier, but before reaching\r\nthe promontory called Trélaporte, we take once more to the mountain\r\nside; for though the path here has been forsaken on account of its\r\ndanger, for the sake of knowledge we are prepared to incur danger\r\nto a reasonable extent. A little glacier reposes on the slope to\r\nour right. We may see a huge boulder or two poised on the end of\r\nthe glacier, and, if fortunate, also see the boulder liberated and\r\nplunging violently down the slope. Presence of mind is all that is\r\nnecessary to render our safety certain; but travellers do not always\r\nshow presence of mind, and hence the path which formerly led over\r\nthis slope has been forsaken. The whole slope is cumbered by masses\r\nof rock which this little glacier has sent down. These I wished you\r\nto see; by and by they shall be fully accounted for.\r\n\r\n115. Above Trélaporte to the right you see a most singular cleft in\r\nthe rocks, in the middle of which stands an isolated pillar, hewn out\r\nby the weather. Our next object is to get to the tower of rock to\r\nthe left of that cleft, for from that position we shall gain a most\r\ncommanding and instructive view of the Mer de Glace and its sources.\r\n\r\n116. The cleft referred to, with its pillar, may be seen to the\r\nright of the preceding engraving of the Mer de Glace. Below the cleft\r\nis also seen the little glacier just referred to.\r\n\r\n117. We may reach this cleft by a steep gully, visible from our\r\npresent position, and leading directly up to the cleft. But these\r\ngullies, or couloirs, are very dangerous, being the pathways of\r\nstones falling from the heights. We will therefore take the rocks\r\nto the left of the gully, by close inspection ascertain their\r\nassailable points, and there attack them. In the Alps as elsewhere\r\nwonderful things may be done by looking steadfastly at difficulties,\r\nand testing them wherever they appear assailable. We thus reach our\r\nstation, where the glory of the prospect, and the insight that we\r\ngain as to the formation of the Mer de Glace, far more than repay us\r\nfor the labour of our ascent.\r\n\r\n118. For we see the glacier below us, stretching its frozen tongue\r\ndownwards past the Montanvert. And we now find this single glacier\r\nbranching out into three others, some of them wider than itself.\r\nRegard the branch to the right, the Glacier du Géant. It stretches\r\nsmoothly up for a long distance, then becomes disturbed, and then\r\nchanges to a great frozen cascade, down which the ice appears to\r\ntumble in wild confusion. Above the cascade you see an expanse of\r\nshining snow, occupying an area of some square miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 14. _Ice-cascade and Snows of the Col du Géant._\r\n\r\n119. Instead of climbing to the height where we now stand, we might\r\nhave continued our walk upon the Mer de Glace, turned round the\r\npromontory of Trélaporte, and walked right up the Glacier du Géant.\r\nWe should have found ice under our feet up to the bottom of the\r\ncascade. It is not so compact as the ice lower down, but you would\r\nnot think of refusing to call it ice.\r\n\r\n120. As we approach the fall, the smooth and unbroken character of\r\nthe glacier changes more and more. We encounter transverse ridges\r\nsucceeding each other with augmenting steepness. The ice becomes more\r\nand more fissured and confused. We wind through tortuous ravines,\r\nclimb huge ice-mounds, and creep cautiously along crumbling crests,\r\nwith crevasses right and left. The confusion increases until further\r\nadvance along the centre of the glacier is impossible.\r\n\r\n121. But with the aid of an axe to cut steps in the steeper ice-walls\r\nand slopes we might, by swerving to either side of the glacier, work\r\nour way to the top of the cascade. If we ascended to the right,\r\nwe should have to take care of the ice avalanches which sometimes\r\nthunder down the slopes; if to the left, we should have to take care\r\nof the stones let loose from the Aiguille Noire. After we had cleared\r\nthe cascade, we should have to beware for a time of the crevasses,\r\nwhich for some distance above the fall yawn terribly. But by caution\r\nwe could get round them, and sometimes cross them by bridges of snow.\r\nHere the skill and knowledge to be acquired only by long practice\r\ncome into play; and here also the use of the Alpine rope suggests\r\nitself. For not only are the 'snow bridges often frail, but whole\r\ncrevasses are sometimes covered, the unhappy traveller being first\r\nmade aware of their existence by the snow breaking under his feet.\r\nMany lives have thus been lost, and some quite recently.\r\n\r\n122. Once upon the plateau above the ice-fall we find the surface\r\ntotally changed. Below the fall we walked upon ice; here we are\r\nupon snow. After a gentle but long ascent we reach a depression of\r\nthe ridge which bounds the snow-field at the top, and now look over\r\nItaly. We stand upon the famous Col du Géant.\r\n\r\n123. They were no idle scamperers on the mountains that made these\r\nwild recesses first known; it was not the desire for health which\r\nnow brings some, or the desire for grandeur and beauty which brings\r\nothers, or the wish to be able to say that they have climbed a\r\nmountain or crossed a col, which I fear brings a good many more; it\r\nwas a desire for _knowledge_ that brought the first explorers here,\r\nand on this col the celebrated De Saussure lived for seventeen days,\r\nmaking scientific observations.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 15. _Questioning the Glaciers._\r\n\r\n124. I would now ask you to consider for a moment the facts which\r\nsuch an excursion places in our possession. The snow through which\r\nwe have in idea trudged is the snow of last winter and spring. Had\r\nwe placed last August a proper mark upon the surface of the snow, we\r\nshould find it this August at a certain depth beneath the surface. A\r\ngood deal has been melted by the summer sun, but a good deal of it\r\nremains, and it will continue until the snows of the coming winter\r\nfall and cover it. This again will be in part preserved till next\r\nAugust, a good deal of it remaining until it is covered by the snow\r\nof the subsequent winter. We thus arrive at the certain conclusion\r\nthat on the plateau of the Col du Géant _the quantity of snow that\r\nfalls annually exceeds the quantity melted_.\r\n\r\n125. Had we come in the month of April or May, we should have found\r\nthe glacier below the ice-fall also covered with snow, which is now\r\nentirely cleared away by the heat of summer. Nay, more, the ice there\r\nis obviously melting, forming running brooks which cut channels in\r\nthe ice, and expand here and there into small blue-green lakes. Hence\r\nyou conclude with certainty that below the ice-fall _the quantity of\r\nfrozen material falling upon the glacier is less than the quantity\r\nmelted_.\r\n\r\n126. And this forces upon us another conclusion: between the glacier\r\nbelow the ice-fall and the plateau above it there must exist a line\r\nwhere the quantity of snow which falls _is exactly equal_ to the\r\nquantity annually melted. This is the _snow-line_. On some glaciers\r\nit is quite distinct, and it would be distinct here were the ice less\r\nbroken and confused than it actually is.\r\n\r\n127. The French term _névé_ is applied to the glacial region above\r\nthe snow-line, while the word _glacier_ is restricted to the ice\r\nbelow it. Thus the snows of the Col du Géant constitute the névé of\r\nthe Glacier du Géant, and in part, the névé of the Mer de Glace.\r\n\r\n128. But if every year thus leaves a residue of snow upon the plateau\r\nof the Col du Géant, it necessarily follows that the plateau must get\r\nannually higher, _provided the snow remain upon it_. Equally certain\r\nis the conclusion that the whole length of the glacier below the\r\ncascade must sink gradually lower, _if the waste of annual melting\r\nbe not made good_. Supposing two feet of snow a year to remain upon\r\nthe Col, this would raise it to a height far surpassing that of Mont\r\nBlanc in five thousand years. Such accumulation must take place if\r\nthe snow remain upon the Col; but the accumulation does _not_ take\r\nplace, hence the snow does not remain on the Col. The question then\r\nis, whither does it go?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH-PLAN, SHOWING THE MORAINES, _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_,\r\n_e_, OF THE MER DE GLACE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 16. _Branches and Medial Moraines of the Mer de Glace from the\r\nCleft Station._\r\n\r\n129. We shall grapple with this question immediately. Meanwhile\r\nlook at that ice-valley in front of us, stretching up between Mont\r\nTacul and the Aiguille de Léchaud, to the base of the great ridge\r\ncalled the Grande Jorasse. This is called the Glacier de Léchaud. It\r\nreceives at its head the snows of the Jorasse and of Mont Mallet,\r\nand joins the Glacier du Géant at the promontory of the Tacul. The\r\nglaciers seem welded together where they join, but they continue\r\ndistinct. Between them you clearly trace a stripe of débris (_c_ on\r\nthe annexed sketch-plan); you trace a similar though smaller stripe\r\n(_a_ on the sketch), from the junction of the Glacier du Géant with\r\nthe Glacier des Périades at the foot of the Aiguille Noire, which you\r\nalso follow along the Mer de Glace.\r\n\r\n130. We also see another glacier, or a portion of it, to the left,\r\nfalling apparently in broken fragments through a narrow gorge\r\n(Cascade du Talèfre on the sketch) and joining the Léchaud, and from\r\ntheir point of junction also a stripe of débris (_d_) runs downwards\r\nalong the Mer de Glace. Beyond this again we notice another stripe\r\n(_e_), which seems to begin at the bottom of the ice-fall, rising\r\nas it were from the body of the glacier. Beyond all of these we can\r\nnotice the lateral moraine of the Mer de Glace.\r\n\r\n131. These stripes are the _medial moraines_ of the Mer de Glace. We\r\nshall learn more about them immediately.\r\n\r\n132. And now, having informed our minds by these observations, let\r\nour eyes wander over the whole glorious scene, the splintered peaks\r\nand the hacked and jagged crests, the far-stretching snow-fields, the\r\nsmaller glaciers which nestle on the heights, the deep blue heaven\r\nand the sailing clouds. Is it not worth some labour to gain command\r\nof such a scene? But the delight it imparts is heightened by the\r\nfact that we did not come expressly to see it; we came to instruct\r\nourselves about the glacier, and this high enjoyment is an incident\r\nof our labour. You will find it thus through life; without honest\r\nlabour there can be no deep joy.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 17. _The Talèfre and the Jardin. Work among the Crevasses._\r\n\r\n133. And now let us descend to the Mer de Glace, for I want to take\r\nyou across the glacier to that broken ice-fall the origin of which we\r\nhave not yet seen. We aim at the farther side of the glacier, and to\r\nreach it we must cross those dark stripes of débris which we observed\r\nfrom the heights. Looked at from above, these moraines seemed flat,\r\nbut now we find them to be ridges of stones and rubbish, from twenty\r\nto thirty feet high.\r\n\r\n134. We quit the ice at a place called the Couvercle, and wind round\r\nthis promontory, ascending all the time. We squeeze ourselves through\r\nthe _Égralets_, a kind of natural staircase in the rock, and soon\r\nafterwards obtain a full view of the ice-fall, the origin of which we\r\nwish to find. The ice upon the fall is much broken; we have pinnacles\r\nand towers, some erect, some leaning, and some, if we are fortunate,\r\nfalling like those upon the Glacier des Bois; and we have chasms from\r\nwhich issues a delicate blue light. With the ice-fall to our right\r\nwe continue to ascend, until at length we command a view of a huge\r\nglacier basin, almost level, and on the middle of which stands a\r\nsolitary island, entirely surrounded by ice. We stand at the edge of\r\nthe _Glacier du Talèfre_, and connect it with the ice-fall we have\r\npassed. The glacier is bounded by rocky ridges, hacked and torn at\r\nthe top into teeth and edges, and buttressed by snow fluted by the\r\ndescending stones.\r\n\r\n135. We cross the basin to the central island, and find grass and\r\nflowers at the place where we enter upon it. This is the celebrated\r\n_Jardin_, of which you have often heard. The upper part of the Jardin\r\nis bare rock. Close at hand is one of the noblest peaks in this\r\nportion of the Alps, the Aiguille Verte. It is between thirteen and\r\nfourteen thousand feet high, and down its sides, after freshly-fallen\r\nsnow, avalanches incessantly thunder. From one of its projections a\r\nstreak of moraine starts down the Talèfre; from the Jardin also a\r\nsimilar streak of moraine issues. Both continue side by side to the\r\ntop of the ice-fall, where they are engulphed in the chasms. But at\r\nthe bottom of the fall they reappear, as if newly emerging from the\r\nbody of the glacier, and afterwards they continue along the Mer de\r\nGlace.\r\n\r\n136. Walk with me now alongside the moraine from the Jardin down\r\ntowards the ice-fall. For a time our work is easy, such fissures as\r\nappear offering no impediment to our march. But the crevasses become\r\ngradually wider and wilder, following each other at length so rapidly\r\nas to leave merely walls of ice between them. Here perfect steadiness\r\nof foot is necessary a slip would be death. We look towards the fall,\r\nand observe the confusion of walls and blocks and chasms below us\r\nincreasing. At length prudence and reason cry \"Halt!\" We may swerve\r\nto the right or to the left, and making our way along crests of ice,\r\nwith chasms on both hands, reach either the right lateral moraine or\r\nthe left lateral moraine of the glacier.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 18. _First Questions regarding Glacier Motion. Drifting of Bodies\r\nburied in a Crevasse._\r\n\r\n137. But what are these lateral moraines? As you and I go from day\r\nto day along the glaciers, their origin is gradually made plain. We\r\nsee at intervals the stones and rubbish descending from the mountain\r\nsides and arrested by the ice. All along the fringe of the glacier\r\nthe stones and rubbish fall, and it soon becomes evident that we\r\nhave here the source of the lateral moraines.\r\n\r\n138. But how are the medial moraines to be accounted for? How does\r\nthe débris range itself upon the glacier in stripes some hundreds\r\nof yards from its edge, leaving the space between them and the edge\r\nclear of rubbish? Some have supposed the stones to have rolled\r\nover the glacier from the sides, but the supposition will not bear\r\nexamination. Call to mind now our reasoning regarding the excess of\r\nsnow which falls above the snow-line, and our subsequent question,\r\nHow is the snow disposed of. Can it be that the entire mass is moving\r\nslowly downwards? If so, the lateral moraines would be carried along\r\nby the ice on which they rest, and when two branch glaciers unite\r\nthey would lay their adjacent lateral moraines together to form a\r\nmedial moraine upon the trunk glacier.\r\n\r\n139. There is, in fact, no way that we can see of disposing of the\r\nexcess of snow above the snow-line; there is no way of making good\r\nthe constant waste of the ice below the snow-line; there is no way of\r\naccounting for the medial moraines of the glacier, but by supposing\r\nthat from the highest snow-fields of the Col du Géant, the Léchaud,\r\nand the Talèfre, to the extreme end of the Glacier des Bois, the\r\nwhole mass of frozen matter is moving downwards.\r\n\r\n140. If you were older, it would give me pleasure to take you up\r\nMont Blanc. Starting from Chamouni, we should first pass through\r\nwoods and pastures, then up the steep hill-face with the Glacier des\r\nBossons to our right, to a rock known as the _Pierre Pointue_; thence\r\nto a higher rock called the _Pierre l'Échelle_, because here a ladder\r\nis usually placed to assist in crossing the chasms of the glacier.\r\nAt the Pierre l'Échelle we should strike the ice, and passing under\r\nthe Aiguille du Midi, which towers to the left, and which sometimes\r\nsweeps a portion of the track with stone avalanches, we should cross\r\nthe Glacier des Bossons; amid heaped-up mounds and broken towers of\r\nice; up steep slopes; over chasms so deep that their bottoms are hid\r\nin darkness.\r\n\r\n141. We reach the rocks of the Grands Mulets, which form a kind\r\nof barren islet in the icy sea; thence to the higher snow-fields,\r\ncrossing the _Petit Plateau_, which we should find cumbered by blocks\r\nof ice. Looking to the right, we should see whence they came, for\r\nrising here with threatening aspect high above us are the broken\r\nice-crags[B] of the Dôme du Goûté. The guides wish to pass this place\r\nin silence, and it is just as well to humour them, however much you\r\nmay doubt the competence of the human voice to bring the ice-crags\r\ndown. From the Petit Plateau a steep snow-slope would carry us to the\r\nGrand Plateau, and at day-dawn I know nothing in the whole Alps more\r\ngrand and solemn than this place.\r\n\r\n[B] Named _séracs_ from their resemblance in shape and colour to an\r\ninferior kind of curdy cheese called by this name at Chamouni.\r\n\r\n142. One object of our ascent would be now attained; for here at the\r\nhead of the Grand Plateau, and at the foot of the final slope of Mont\r\nBlanc, I should show you a great crevasse, into which three guides\r\nwere poured by an avalanche in the year 1820.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CREVASSE ON GRAND PLATEAU.]\r\n\r\n143. Is this language correct? A crevasse hardly to be distinguished\r\nfrom the present one undoubtedly existed here in 1820. But was it\r\nthe identical crevasse now existing? Is the ice riven here to-day\r\nthe same as that riven fifty-one years ago? By no means. How is this\r\nproved? By the fact that more than forty years after their interment,\r\nthe remains of those three guides were found near the end of the\r\nGlacier des Bossons, many miles below the existing crevasse.\r\n\r\n144. The same observation proves to demonstration that it is the ice\r\nnear the _bottom_ of the higher névé that becomes the _surface-ice_\r\nof the glacier near its end. The waste of the surface below the\r\nsnow-line brings the deeper portions of the ice more and more to the\r\nlight of day.\r\n\r\n145. There are numerous obvious indications of the existence of\r\nglacier motion, though it is too slow to catch the eye at once.\r\nThe crevasses change within certain limits from year to year, and\r\nsometimes from month to month; and this could not be if the ice did\r\nnot move. Rocks and stones also are observed, which have been plainly\r\ntorn from the mountain sides. Blocks seen to fall from particular\r\npoints are afterwards observed lower down. On the moraines rocks\r\nare found of a totally different mineralogical character from those\r\ncomposing the mountains right and left; and in all such cases strata\r\nof the same character are found bordering the glacier higher up.\r\nHence the conclusion that the foreign boulders have been _floated_\r\ndown by the ice. Further, the ends or \"snouts\" of many glaciers act\r\nlike ploughshares on the land in front of them, overturning with slow\r\nbut merciless energy huts and chalets that stand in their way. Facts\r\nlike these have been long known to the inhabitants of the High Alps,\r\nwho were thus made acquainted in a vague and general way with the\r\nmotion of the glaciers.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 19. _The Motion of Glaciers. Measurements by Hugi and Agassiz.\r\nDrifting of Huts on the Ice._\r\n\r\n146. But the growth of knowledge is from vagueness towards precision,\r\nand exact determinations of the rate of glacier motion were soon\r\ndesired. With reference to such measurements one glacier in the\r\nBernese Oberland will remain forever memorable. From the little town\r\nof Meyringen in Switzerland you proceed up the valley of Hasli, past\r\nthe celebrated waterfall of Handeck, where the river Aar plunges into\r\na chasm more than 200 feet deep. You approach the Grimsel Pass, but\r\ninstead of crossing it you turn to the right and follow the course of\r\nthe Aar upwards. Like the Rhone and the Arveiron, you find the Aar\r\nissuing from a glacier.\r\n\r\n147. Get upon the ice, or rather upon the deep moraine shingle which\r\ncovers the ice, and walk upwards. It is hard walking, but after\r\nsome time you get clear of the rubbish, and on to a wide glacier\r\nwith a great medial moraine running along its back. This moraine is\r\nformed by the junction of two branch glaciers, the Lauteraar and the\r\nFinsteraar, which unite at a promontory called the Abschwung to form\r\nthe trunk glacier of the Unteraar.\r\n\r\n148. On this great medial moraine in 1827 an intrepid and\r\nenthusiastic Swiss professor, Hugi, of Solothurm (French Soleure),\r\nbuilt a hut with a view to observations upon the glacier. His hut\r\nmoved, and he measured its motion. In the three years--from 1827 to\r\n1830--it had moved 330 feet downwards. In 1836 it had moved 2,354\r\nfeet; and in 1841 M. Agassiz found it 4,712 feet below its first\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n149. In 1840, M. Agassiz himself and some bold companions took\r\nshelter under a great overhanging slab of rock on the same moraine,\r\nto which they added side walls and other means of protection. And\r\nbecause he and his comrades came from Neufchâtel, the hut was called\r\nlong afterwards the \"Hôtel des Neuchâtelois.\" Two years subsequent\r\nto its erection M. Agassiz found that the \"hotel\" had moved 486 feet\r\ndownwards.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 20. _Precise Measurements of Agassiz and Forbes. Motion of a\r\nGlacier proved to resemble the Motion of a River._\r\n\r\n150. We now approach an epoch in the scientific history of glaciers.\r\nHad the first observers been practically acquainted with the\r\ninstruments of precision used in surveying, _accurate_ measurements\r\nof the motion of glaciers would probably have been earlier executed.\r\nWe are now on the point of seeing such instruments introduced almost\r\nsimultaneously by M. Agassiz on the glacier of the Unteraar, and by\r\nProfessor Forbes on the Mer de Glace. Attempts had been made by M.\r\nEscher de la Linth to determine the motion of a series of wooden\r\nstakes driven into the Aletsch glacier, but the melting was so\r\nrapid that the stakes soon fell. To remedy this, M. Agassiz in 1841\r\nundertook the great labour of carrying boring tools to his \"hotel,\"\r\nand piercing the Unteraar glacier at six different places to a depth\r\nof ten feet, in a straight line across the glacier. Into the holes\r\nsix piles were so firmly driven that they remained in the glacier for\r\na year, and in 1842 the displacements of all six were determined.\r\nThey were found to be 160 feet, 225 feet, 269 feet, 245 feet, 210\r\nfeet, and 125 feet, respectively.\r\n\r\n151. A great step is here gained. You notice that the middle numbers\r\nare the largest. They correspond to the central portion of the\r\nglacier. Hence, these measurements conclusively establish, not only\r\nthe fact of glacier motion, but that _the centre of a glacier, like\r\nthat of a river, moves more rapidly than the sides_.\r\n\r\n152. With the aid of trained engineers M. Agassiz followed up these\r\nmeasurements in subsequent years. His researches are recorded in a\r\nwork entitled \"Système glaciaire,\" which is accompanied by a very\r\nnoble Atlas of the Glacier of the Unteraar, published in 1847.\r\n\r\n153. These determinations were made by means of a theodolite, of\r\nwhich I will give you some notion immediately. The same instrument\r\nwas employed the same year by the late Professor Forbes upon the\r\nMer de Glace. He established independently the greater central\r\nmotion. He showed, moreover, that it is not necessary to wait a\r\nyear, or even a week to determine the motion of a glacier; with a\r\ncorrectly-adjusted theodolite he was able to determine the motion\r\nof various points of the Mer de Glace from day to day. He affirmed,\r\nand with truth, that the motion of the glacier might be determined\r\nfrom hour to hour. We shall prove this farther on (162). Professor\r\nForbes also triangulated the Mer de Glace, and laid down an excellent\r\nmap of it. His first observations and his survey are recorded in a\r\ncelebrated book published in 1843, and entitled \"Travels in the Alps.\"\r\n\r\n154. These observations were also followed up in subsequent years,\r\nthe results being recorded in a series of detached letters and essays\r\nof great interest. These were subsequently collected in a volume\r\nentitled \"Occasional Papers on the Theory of Glaciers,\" published in\r\n1859. The labours of Agassiz and Forbes are the two chief sources of\r\nour knowledge of glacier phenomena.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 21. _The Theodolite and its Use. Our own Measurements._\r\n\r\n155. My object thus far is attained. I have given you proofs of\r\nglacier motion, and a historic account of its measurement. And\r\nnow we must try to add a little to the knowledge of glaciers by\r\nour own labours on the ice. Resolution must not be wanting at\r\nthe commencement of our work, nor steadfast patience during its\r\nprosecution. Look then at this theodolite; it consists mainly of a\r\ntelescope and a graduated circle, the telescope capable of motion\r\nup and down, and the circle, carrying the telescope along with it,\r\ncapable of motion right and left. When desired to make the motion\r\nexceedingly fine and minute, suitable screws, called tangent screws,\r\nare employed. The instrument is supported by three legs, movable, but\r\nfirm when properly planted.\r\n\r\n156. Two spirit-levels are fixed at right angles to each other on\r\nthe circle just referred to. Practice enables one to take hold of\r\nthe legs of the instrument, and so to fix them that the circle shall\r\nbe nearly horizontal. By means of four levelling screws we render it\r\n_accurately_ horizontal. Exactly under the centre of the instrument\r\nis a small hook from which a plummet is suspended; the point of the\r\nbob just touches a rock on which we make a mark; or if the earth be\r\nsoft underneath, we drive a stake into it exactly under the plummet.\r\nBy re-suspending the plummet at any future time we can find to a\r\nhairbreadth the position occupied by the instrument to-day.\r\n\r\n157. Look through the telescope; you see it crossed by two fibres\r\nof the finest spider's thread. In actual work we first direct the\r\ntelescope across the glacier, until the intersection of the two\r\nfibres accurately covers some well-defined point of rock or tree at\r\nthe other side of the valley. This, our fixed standard, we sketch\r\nwith its surroundings in a note-book, so as to be able immediately\r\nto recognise it on our return to this place. Imagine a straight line\r\ndrawn from the centre of the telescope to this point, and that this\r\nline is permitted to drop straight down upon the glacier, every point\r\nof it falling as a stone would fall; along such a line we have now to\r\nfix a series of stakes.\r\n\r\n158. A trained assistant is already upon the glacier. He erects\r\nhis staff and stands behind it; the telescope is lowered without\r\nswerving to the right or to the left; in mathematical language it\r\nremains _in the same vertical plane_. The crossed fibres of the\r\ntelescope probably strike the ice a little away from the staff of the\r\nassistant; by a wave of the arm he moves right or left; he may move\r\ntoo much, so we wave him back again. After a trial or two he knows\r\nwhether he is near the proper point, and if so makes his motions\r\nsmall. He soon exactly strikes the point covered by the intersection\r\nof the fibres. A signal is made which tells him that he is right; he\r\npierces the ice with an auger and drives in a stake. He then goes\r\nforward, and in precisely the same manner takes up another point.\r\nAfter one or two stakes have been driven in, the assistant is able to\r\ntake up the other points very rapidly. Any requisite number of stakes\r\nmay thus be fixed in a straight line across the glacier.\r\n\r\n159. Next morning we measure the motion of all the stakes. The\r\ntheodolite is mounted in its former position and carefully levelled.\r\nThe telescope is directed first upon the standard point at the\r\nopposite side of the valley, being moved by a tangent screw until the\r\nintersection of the spider's threads accurately covers the point.\r\nThe telescope is then lowered to the first stake, beside which our\r\ntrained assistant is already standing. He is provided with a staff\r\nwith feet and inches marked on it. A glance shows us the stake has\r\nmoved down. By our signals the assistant recovers the point from\r\nwhich we started yesterday, and then determines the distance from\r\nthis point to the stake. It is, say, 6 inches; through this distance,\r\ntherefore, the stake has moved.\r\n\r\n160. We are careful to note the hour and minute at which each stake\r\nis driven in, and the hour and the minute when its distance from its\r\nfirst position is measured; this enables us to calculate the accurate\r\n_daily motion_ of the point in question. The distances through which\r\nall the other points have moved are determined in precisely the same\r\nway.\r\n\r\n161. Thus we shall proceed to work, first making clear to our minds\r\nwhat is to be done, and then making sure that it shall be accurately\r\ndone. To give our work reality, I will here record the actual\r\nmeasurements executed, and the actual thoughts suggested, on the\r\nMer de Glace in 1857. The only unreality that I would ask you to\r\nallow, is that you and I are supposed to be making the observations\r\ntogether. The labour of measuring was undertaken for the most part\r\nby Mr. Hirst.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 22. _Motion of the Mer de Glace._\r\n\r\n162. On July 14, then, we find ourselves at the end of the Glacier\r\ndes Bois, not far from the source of the Arveiron. We direct our\r\ntelescope across the glacier, and fix the intersection of its\r\nspider's threads accurately upon the edge of a pinnacle of ice. We\r\nleave the instrument untouched, looking through it from hour to\r\nhour. The edge of ice moves slowly, but plainly, past the fibres,\r\nand at the end of three hours we assure ourselves that the motion\r\nhas amounted to several inches. While standing near the vault of the\r\nArveiron, and talking about going into it, its roof gives way, and\r\nfalls with the sound of thunder. It is not, therefore, without reason\r\nthat I warned you against entering these vaults in summer.\r\n\r\n163. We ascend to the Montanvert Inn, fix on it as a residence, and\r\nthen descend to the lateral moraine of the glacier a little below the\r\ninn. Here we erect our theodolite, and mark its exact position by\r\na plummet. We must first make sure that our line is perpendicular,\r\nor nearly so, to the axis or middle line of the glacier. Our\r\ninstructed assistant lays down a long staff in the direction of\r\nthe axis, assuring himself, by looking up and down, that it is the\r\ntrue direction. With another staff in his hand, pointed towards\r\nour theodolite, he shifts his position until the second staff is\r\nperpendicular to the first. Here he gives us a signal. We direct our\r\ntelescope upon him, and then gradually raising its end in a vertical\r\nplane we find, and note by sketching, a standard point at the other\r\nside of the glacier. This point known, and our plummet mark known, we\r\ncan on any future day find our line. (To render the measurements more\r\nintelligible, I append on the next page an outline diagram of the Mer\r\nde Glace, and of its tributaries.)\r\n\r\n164. Along the line just described ten stakes were set on July 17,\r\n1857. Their displacements were measured on the following day. Two of\r\nthem had fallen, but here are the distances passed over by the eight\r\nremaining ones in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nDAILY MOTION OF THE MER DE GLACE.\r\n\r\nFirst Line: A A' upon the Sketch.\r\n\r\n        East                 West\r\n  Stake   1  2  3  4  5  7  9 10\r\n  Inches 12 17 23 26 25 26 27 33\r\n\r\n165. You have already assured yourself by actual contact that the\r\nbody of the glacier is real ice, and you may have read that glaciers\r\nmove; but the actual observation of the motion of a body apparently\r\nso rigid is strangely interesting. And not only does the ice move\r\nbodily, but one part of it moves past another; the rate of motion\r\naugmenting gradually from 12 inches a day at the side to 33 inches a\r\nday at a distance from the side. This quicker movement of the central\r\nice of glaciers had been already observed by Agassiz and Forbes; we\r\nverify their results, and now proceed to something new. Crossing the\r\nGlacier du Géant, which occupies more than half the valley, we find\r\nthat our line of stakes is not yet at an end. The 10th stake stands\r\non the part of the ice which comes from the Talèfre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUTLINE PLAN, SHOWING THE MEASURED LINES OF THE MER DE\r\nGLACE AND ITS TRIBUTARIES.]\r\n\r\n166. Now the motion of the sides is slow, because of the friction of\r\nthe ice against its boundaries; but then one would think that midway\r\nbetween the boundaries, where the friction of the sides is least, the\r\nmotion ought to be greatest. This is clearly not the case; for though\r\nthe 10th stake is nearer than the 9th to the eastern or _Chapeau_\r\nside of the valley, the 10th stake surpasses the 9th by 6 inches a\r\nday.\r\n\r\n167. Here we have something to think of; but before a natural\r\nphilosopher can think with comfort he must be perfectly sure of his\r\nfacts. The foregoing line ran across the glacier a little below the\r\nMontanvert. We will run another line across a little way above the\r\nhotel. On July 18 we set out this line, and to multiply our chances\r\nof discovery we place along it 31 stakes. On the subsequent day five\r\nof these were found unfit for use; but here are the distances passed\r\nover by the remaining six-and-twenty in 24 hours.\r\n\r\nSecond Line: B B' upon the Sketch.\r\n\r\n         West\r\n  Stake   2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13\r\n  Inches 11 12 15 15 16 17 18 19 20 20 21 21\r\n  Stake  15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26\r\n  Inches 23 23 23 21 23 21 25 22 22 23 25 26\r\n                                         East\r\n\r\n168. Look at these numbers. The first broad fact they reveal is the\r\nadvance in the rate of motion from first to last. There are however\r\nsome irregularities; from 23 inches at the 17th stake we fall to 21\r\ninches at the 18th; from 23 inches at the 19th we fall to 21 inches\r\nat the 20th; from 25 inches at the 21st we fall to 22 inches at the\r\n22nd and 23rd; but notwithstanding these small ups and downs, the\r\ngeneral advance of the rate of motion is manifest. Now there may have\r\nbeen some slight displacement of the stakes by melting, sufficient to\r\naccount for these small deviations from uniformity in the increase\r\nof the motion. But another solution is also possible. We shall\r\nafterwards learn that the glacier is retarded not only by its sides\r\nbut by its bed; that the upper portions of the ice slide over the\r\nlower ones. Now if the bed of the Mer de Glace should have eminences\r\nhere and there rising sufficiently near to the surface to retard the\r\nmotion of the surface, they might produce the small irregularities\r\nnoticed above.\r\n\r\n169. We note particularly, while upon the ice, that the 26th stake,\r\nlike the 10th stake in our last line, stands much nearer to the\r\neastern than to the western side of the glacier; the measurements,\r\ntherefore, offer a further proof that the centre of this portion of\r\nthe glacier is not the place of swiftest motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 23. _Unequal Motion of the two Sides of the Mer de Glace._\r\n\r\n170. But in neither the first line nor the second were we able to\r\npush our measurements quite across the glacier. Why? In attempting\r\nto do one thing we are often taught another, and thus in science, if\r\nwe are only steadfast in our work, our very defeats are converted\r\ninto means of instruction. We at first planted our theodolite on the\r\nlateral moraine of the Mer de Glace, expecting to be able to command\r\nthe glacier from side to side. But we are now undeceived; the centre\r\nof the glacier proves to be higher than its sides, and from our last\r\ntwo positions the view of the ice near the opposite side of the\r\nglacier was intercepted by the elevation at the centre. The mountain\r\nslopes, in fact, are warm in summer, and they melt the ice nearest to\r\nthem, thus causing a fall from the centre to the sides.\r\n\r\n171. But yonder on the heights at the other side of the glacier we\r\nsee a likely place for our theodolite. We cross the glacier and plant\r\nour instrument in a position from which we sweep the glacier from\r\nside to side. Our first line was below the Montanvert, our second\r\nline above it; this third line is exactly opposite the Montanvert;\r\nin fact, the mark on which we have fixed the fibre-cross of the\r\ntheodolite is a corner of one of the windows of the little inn. Along\r\nthis line we fix twelve stakes on July 20. On the 21st one of them\r\nhad fallen; but the velocities of the remaining eleven in 24 hours\r\nwere found to be as follows:--\r\n\r\nThird Line: C C' upon the Sketch.\r\n\r\n          East                         West\r\n  Stake     1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11\r\n  Inches   20 23 29 30 34 28 25 25 25 18  9\r\n\r\n172. Both the first stake and the eleventh in this series stood\r\nnear the sides of the glacier. On the eastern side the motion is\r\n20 inches, while on the western side it is only 9. It rises on\r\nthe eastern side from 20 to 34 inches at the 5th stake, which we,\r\nstanding upon the glacier, can see to be much nearer to the eastern\r\nthan to the western side. _The united evidence of these three lines\r\nplaces the fact beyond doubt, that opposite the Montanvert, and for\r\nsome distance above it and below it, the whole eastern side of the\r\nglacier is moving more quickly than the western side._\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 24. _Suggestion of a new Likeness of Glacier Motion to River\r\nMotion. Conjecture tested._\r\n\r\n173. Here we have cause for reflection, and facts are comparatively\r\nworthless if they do not provoke this exercise of the mind. It\r\nis because facts of nature are not isolated but connected, that\r\nscience, to follow them, must also form a connected whole. The mind\r\nof the natural philosopher must, as it were, be a web of _thought_\r\ncorresponding in all its fibres with the web of _fact_ in nature.\r\n\r\n174. Let us, then, ascend to a point which commands a good view\r\nof this portion of the Mer de Glace. The ice-river we see is not\r\nstraight but curved, and its curvature is _from_ the Montanvert;\r\nthat is to say, its convex side is east, and its concave side is\r\nwest (look to the sketch). You have already pondered the fact that a\r\nglacier, _in some respects_, moves like a river. How would a river\r\nmove through a curved channel? This is known. Were the ice of the\r\nMer de Glace displaced by water, the point of swiftest motion at the\r\nMontanvert would not be the centre, but a point east of the centre.\r\nCan it be then that this \"water-rock,\" as ice is sometimes called,\r\nacts in this respect also like water?\r\n\r\n175. This is a thought suggested on the spot; it may or it may not\r\nbe true, but the means of testing it are at hand. Looking up the\r\nglacier, we see that at _les Ponts_ it also bends, but that there\r\nits convex curvature is towards the western side of the valley (look\r\nagain to the sketch). If our surmise be true, the point of swiftest\r\nmotion opposite _les Ponts_ ought to lie west of the axis of the\r\nglacier.\r\n\r\n176. Let us test this conjecture. On July 25 we fix in a line across\r\nthis portion of the glacier seventeen stakes; every one of them has\r\nremained firm, and on the 26th we find the motion for 24 hours to be\r\nas follows:--\r\n\r\nFourth Line: D D' upon the Sketch.\r\n\r\n        East                                    West\r\n  Stake   1 2  3  4  5  8  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\r\n  Inches  7 8 13 15 16 19 20 21 21 23 23 21 22 17 15\r\n\r\n177. Inspected by the naked eye alone, the stakes 10 and 11, where\r\nthe glacier reaches its greatest motion, are seen to be considerably\r\nto the west of the axis of the glacier. Thus far we have a perfect\r\nverification of the _guess_ which prompted us to make these\r\nmeasurements. You will here observe that the \"guesses\" of science are\r\nnot the work of chance, but of thoughtful pondering over antecedent\r\nfacts. The guess is the \"induction\" facts, to be ratified or exploded\r\nby the test of subsequent experiment.\r\n\r\n178. And though even now we have exceedingly strong reason for\r\nholding that the point of maximum velocity obeys the law of liquid\r\nmotion, the strength of our conclusion will be doubled if we can\r\nshow that the point shifts back to the eastern side of the axis at\r\nanother place of flexure. Fortunately such a place exists opposite\r\nTrélaporte. Here the convex curvature of the valley turns again to\r\nthe east. Across this portion of the glacier a line was set out on\r\nJuly 28, and from measurements on the 31st, the rate of motion per 24\r\nhours was determined.\r\n\r\nFifth Line: E E' upon the Sketch.\r\n\r\n          West                                     East\r\n  Stake     1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15\r\n  Inches   11 14 13 15 15 16 17 19 20 19 20 18 16 15 10\r\n\r\n179. Here, again, the mere estimate of distances by the eye would\r\nshow us that the three stakes which moved fastest, viz. the 9th,\r\n10th, and 11th, were all to the east of the middle line of the\r\nglacier. The demonstration that the point of swiftest motion wanders\r\nto and fro across the axis, as the flexure of the valley changes, is,\r\ntherefore,--shall I say complete?\r\n\r\n180. Not yet. For if surer means are open to us we must not rest\r\ncontent with estimates by the eye. We have with us a surveying chain:\r\nlet us shake it out and measure these lines, noting the distance of\r\nevery stake from the side of the glacier. This is no easy work among\r\nthe crevasses, but I confide it confidently to Mr. Hirst and you.\r\nWe can afterwards compare a number of stakes on the eastern side\r\nwith the same number of stakes taken at the same distances from the\r\nwestern side. For example, a pair of stakes, one ten yards from the\r\neastern side and the other ten yards from the western side; another\r\npair, one fifty yards from the eastern side and the other fifty yards\r\nfrom the western side, and so on, can be compared together. For the\r\nsake of easy reference, let us call the points thus compared in\r\npairs, _equivalent points_.\r\n\r\n181. There were five pairs of such points upon our fourth line, D D',\r\nand here are their velocities:\r\n\r\n  Eastern points; motion in inches    13 15 16 18 20\r\n  Western   \"       \"     \"    \"      15 17 22 23 23\r\n\r\nIn every case here the stake at the western side moved more rapidly\r\nthan the equivalent stake at the eastern side.\r\n\r\n182. Applying the same analysis to our fifth line, E E', we have the\r\nfollowing series of velocities of three pairs of equivalent points:--\r\n\r\n  Eastern points; motion in inches    15 18 19\r\n  Western   \"       \"     \"    \"      13 15 17\r\n\r\n183. Here the three points on the eastern side move more rapidly than\r\nthe equivalent points on the western side.\r\n\r\n184. It is thus proved:--\r\n\r\n1. _That opposite the Montanvert the eastern half of the Mer de Glace\r\nmoves more rapidly than the western half._\r\n\r\n2. _That opposite_ les Fonts _the western half of the glacier moves\r\nmore rapidly than the eastern half._\r\n\r\n3. _That opposite Trélaporte the eastern half of the glacier again\r\nmoves more rapidly than the western half._\r\n\r\n4. _That these changes in the place of greatest motion are determined\r\nby the flexures of the valley through which the Mer de Glace moves._\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 25. _New Law of Glacier Motion._\r\n\r\n185. Let us express these facts in another way. Supposing the points\r\nof swiftest motion for a very great number of lines crossing the\r\nMer de Glace to be determined; the line joining all those points\r\ntogether is what mathematicians would call the _locus_ of the point\r\nof swiftest motion.\r\n\r\n186. At Trélaporte this line would lie east of the centre; at the\r\n_Ponts_ it would lie west of the centre; hence in passing from\r\nTrélaporte to the _Ponts_ it would cross the centre. But at the\r\nMontanvert it would again lie east of the centre; hence between the\r\n_Ponts_ and the Montanvert the centre must be crossed a second time.\r\nIf there were further sinuosities upon the Mer de Glace there would\r\nbe further crossings of the axis of the glacier.\r\n\r\n187. The points on the axis which mark the transition from eastern to\r\nwestern bending, and the reverse, may be called _points of contrary\r\nflexure_.\r\n\r\n188. Now what is true of the Mer de Glace is true of all other\r\nglaciers moving through sinuous valleys; so that the facts\r\nestablished in the Mer de Glace may be expanded into the following\r\ngeneral law of glacier motion:--\r\n\r\n_When a glacier moves through a sinuous valley, the locus of the\r\npoints of maximum motion does not coincide with the centre of the\r\nglacier, but, on the contrary, always lies on the convex side of\r\nthe central line. The locus is therefore a curved line more deeply\r\nsinuous than the valley itself, and crosses the axis of the glacier\r\nat each point of contrary flexure._\r\n\r\n189. The dotted line on the Outline Plan (page 68) represents the\r\nlocus of the point of maximum motion, the firm line marking the\r\ncentre of the glacier.\r\n\r\n190. Substituting the word _river_ for _glacier_, this law is\r\nalso true. The motion of the water is ruled by precisely the same\r\nconditions as the motion of the ice.\r\n\r\n191. Let us now apply our law to the explanation of a difficulty.\r\nTurning to the careful measurements executed by M. Agassiz on\r\nthe glacier of the Unteraar, we notice in the discussion of these\r\nmeasurements a section of the \"Système glaciaire\" devoted to the\r\n\"Migrations of the Centre.\" It is here shown that the middle of the\r\nUnteraar glacier is not always the point of swiftest motion. This\r\nfact has hitherto remained without explanation; but a glance at the\r\nUnteraar valley, or at the map of the valley, shows the enigma to be\r\nan illustration of the law which we have just established on the Mer\r\nde Glace.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 26. _Motion of Axis of Mer de Glace._\r\n\r\n192. We have now measured the rate of motion of five different lines\r\nacross the trunk of the Mer de Glace. Do they all move alike? No.\r\nLike a river, a glacier at different places moves at different rates.\r\nComparing together the points of maximum motion of all five lines, we\r\nhave this result:\r\n\r\nMOTION OF MER DE GLACE.\r\n\r\n  At Trélaporte          20 inches a day.\r\n  At _les Ponts_         23    \"      \"\r\n  Above the Montanvert   26    \"      \"\r\n  At the Montanvert      34    \"      \"\r\n  Below the Montanvert   33[C] \"      \"\r\n\r\n[C] This is probably under the mark. I think it likely that the\r\nswiftest motion of this portion of the Mer de Glace in 1857 amounted\r\nto a yard in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\n193. There is thus an increase of rapidity as we descend the glacier\r\nfrom Trélaporte to the Montanvert; the maximum, motion at the\r\nMontanvert being fourteen inches a day greater than at Trélaporte.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 27. _Motion of Tributary Glaciers._\r\n\r\n194. So much for the trunk glacier; let us now investigate the\r\nbranches, permitting, as we have hitherto done, reflection on known\r\nfacts to precede our attempts to discover unknown ones.\r\n\r\n195. As we stood upon our \"cleft station,\" whence we had so capital\r\na view of the Mer de Glace, we were struck by the fact that some of\r\nthe tributaries of the glacier were wider than the glacier itself.\r\nSupposing water to be substituted for the ice, how do you suppose\r\nit would behave? You would doubtless conclude that the motion down\r\nthe broad and slightly-inclined valleys of the Géant and the Léchaud\r\nwould be comparatively slow, but that the water would force itself\r\nwith increased rapidity through the \"narrows\" of Trélaporte. Let us\r\ntest this notion as applied to the ice.\r\n\r\n196. Planting our theodolite in the shadow of Mont Tacul, and\r\nchoosing a suitable point at the opposite side of the Glacier du\r\nGéant, we fix on July 29 a series of ten stakes across the glacier.\r\nThe motion of this line in twenty-four hours was as follows:--\r\n\r\nMOTION OF GLACIER DU GÉANT.\r\n\r\nSixth Line: H H' upon Sketch.\r\n\r\n  Stake     1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8 9 10\r\n  Inches   11 10 12 13 12 13 11 10 9  5\r\n\r\n197. Our conjecture is fully verified. The maximum motion here is\r\nseven inches a day less than that of the Mer de Glace at Trélaporte\r\n(192).\r\n\r\n198. And now for the Léchaud branch. On August 1 we fix ten stakes\r\nacross this glacier above the point where it is joined by the\r\nTalèfre. Measured on August 3, and reduced to twenty-four hours, the\r\nmotion was found to be--\r\n\r\nMOTION OF GLACIER DE LÉCHAUD.\r\n\r\nSeventh Line: K K' upon Sketch.\r\n\r\n  Stake  1 2  3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10\r\n  Inches 5 8 10 9 9 8 6 9 7  6\r\n\r\n199. Here our conjecture is still further verified, the rate of\r\nmotion being even less than that of the Glacier du Géant.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 28. _Motion of Top and Bottom of Glacier._\r\n\r\n200. We have here the most ample and varied evidence that the sides\r\nof a glacier, like those of a river, are retarded by friction against\r\nits boundaries. But the likeness does not end here. The motion of a\r\nriver is retarded by the friction against its bed. Two observers,\r\nviz. Prof. Forbes and M. Charles Martins, concur in showing the same\r\nto be the case with a glacier. The observations of both have been\r\nobjected to; hence it is all the more incumbent on us to seek for\r\ndecisive evidence.\r\n\r\n201. At the Tacul (near the point _a_ upon the sketch plan, p. 83) a\r\nwall of ice about 150 feet high has already attracted our attention.\r\nBending round to join the Léchaud the Glacier du Géant is here drawn\r\naway from the mountain side, and exposes a fine section. We try to\r\nmeasure it top, bottom, and middle, and are defeated twice over. We\r\ntry it a third time and succeed. A stake is fixed at the summit of\r\nthe ice-precipice, another at 4 feet from the bottom, and a third at\r\n35 feet above the bottom. These lower stakes are fixed at some risk\r\nof boulders falling upon us from above; but by skill and caution\r\nwe succeed in measuring the motions of all three. For 24 hours the\r\nmotions are:--\r\n\r\n  Top stake      6  inches.\r\n  Middle stake   4½   \"\r\n  Bottom stake   2⅔   \"\r\n\r\n202. The retarding influence of the bed of the glacier is reduced to\r\ndemonstration by these measurements. The bottom does not move with\r\nhalf the velocity of the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 29. _Lateral Compression of a Glacier._\r\n\r\n203. Furnished with the knowledge which these labours and\r\nmeasurements have given us, let us once more climb to our station\r\nbeside the Cleft under the Aiguille de Charmoz. At our first visit\r\nwe saw the medial moraines of the glacier, but we knew nothing about\r\ntheir cause. We now know that they mark upon the trunk its tributary\r\nglaciers. Cast your eye, then, first upon the Glacier du Géant;\r\nrealise its width in its own valley, and see how much it is narrowed\r\nat Trélaporte. The broad ice-stream of the Léchaud is still more\r\nsurprising, being squeezed upon the Mer de Glace to a narrow white\r\nband between its bounding moraines. The Talèfre undergoes similar\r\ncompression. Let us now descend, shake out our chain, measure, and\r\nexpress in numbers the width of the tributaries, and the actual\r\namount of compression suffered at Trélaporte.\r\n\r\n204. We find the width of the Glacier du Géant to be 5,155 links, or\r\n1,134 yards.\r\n\r\n205. The width of the Glacier de Léchaud we find to be 3,725 links,\r\nor 825 yards.\r\n\r\n206. The width of the Talèfre we find to be 2,900 links, or 638 yards.\r\n\r\n207. The sum of the widths of the three branch glaciers is therefore\r\n2,597 yards.\r\n\r\n208. At Trélaporte these three branches are forced through a gorge\r\n893 yards wide, or one-third of their previous width, at the rate of\r\ntwenty inches a day.\r\n\r\n209. If we limit our view to the Glacier de Léchaud, the facts are\r\nstill more astonishing. Previous to its junction with the Talèfre,\r\nthis glacier has a width of 825 yards; in passing through the jaws of\r\nthe granite vice at Trélaporte, its width is reduced to eighty-eight\r\nyards, or in round numbers to one-tenth of its previous width. (Look\r\nto the sketch on the next page.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH-PLAN SHOWING THE MORAINES, _a_, _b_, _c_, _d_,\r\n_e_, OF THE MER DE GLACE.]\r\n\r\n210. Are we to understand by this that the ice of the Léchaud is\r\nsqueezed to one-tenth of its former _volume_? By no means. It is\r\nmainly a change of _form_, not of volume, that occurs at Trélaporte.\r\nPrevious to its compression, the glacier resembles a plate of ice\r\n_lying flat_ upon its bed. After its compression, it resembles a\r\nplate _fixed upon its edge_. The squeezing, doubtless, has deepened\r\nthe ice.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 30. _Longitudinal Compression of a Glacier._\r\n\r\n211. The ice is forced through the gorge at Trélaporte by a pressure\r\nfrom behind; in fact the Glacier du Géant, immediately above\r\nTrélaporte, represents a piston or a plug which drives the ice\r\nthrough the gorge. What effect must this pressure have upon the plug\r\nitself? Reasoning alone renders it probable that the pressure will\r\nshorten the plug; that the lower part of the Glacier du Géant will to\r\nsome extent yield to the pressure from behind.\r\n\r\n212. Let us test this notion. About three-quarters of a mile above\r\nthe Tacul, and on the mountain slope to the left as we ascend, we\r\nobserve a patch of verdure. Thither we climb; there we plant our\r\ntheodolite, and set out across the Glacier du Géant, a line, which we\r\nwill call line No. 1 (F F' upon sketch, p. 68).\r\n\r\n213. About a quarter of a mile lower down we find a practicable\r\ncouloir on the mountain side; we ascend it, reach a suitable\r\nplatform, plant our instrument, and set out a second line, No. 2 (G\r\nG' upon sketch). We must hasten our work here, for along this couloir\r\nstones are discharged from a small glacier which rests upon the slope\r\nof Mont Tacul.\r\n\r\n214. Still lower down by another quarter of a mile, which brings us\r\nnear the Tacul, we set out a third line, No. 3 (H H' upon sketch),\r\nacross the glacier.\r\n\r\n215. The daily motion of the centres of these three lines is as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n             Inches     Distances asunder\r\n  No. 1       50·55 }\r\n                    }      545 yards.\r\n  No. 2       15·43 }\r\n                    }      487   \"\r\n  No. 3       12·75 }\r\n\r\n216. The first line here moves five inches a day more than the\r\nsecond; and the second nearly three inches a day more than the third.\r\nThe reasoning is therefore confirmed. The ice-plug, which is in round\r\nnumbers one thousand yards long, is shortened by the pressure exerted\r\non its front at the rate of about eight inches a day.\r\n\r\n217. A river descending the Valley du Géant would behave in\r\nsubstantially the same fashion. It would have its motion on\r\napproaching Trélaporte diminished, and it would pour through the\r\ndefile with a velocity greater than that of the water behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 31. _Sliding and Flowing. Hard Ice and Soft Ice._\r\n\r\n218. We have thus far confined ourselves to the measurement and\r\ndiscussion of glacier motion; but in our excursions we have noticed\r\nmany things besides. Here and there, where the ice has retreated\r\nfrom the mountain side, we have seen the rocks fluted, scored, and\r\npolished; thus proving that the ice had slidden over them and ground\r\nthem down. At the source of the Arveiron we noticed the water rushing\r\nfrom beneath the glacier charged with fine matter. All glacier rivers\r\nare similarly charged. The Rhone carries its load of matter into the\r\nLake of Geneva; the rush of the river is here arrested, the matter\r\nsubsides, and the Rhone quits the lake clear and blue. The Lake of\r\nGeneva, and many other Swiss lakes, are in part filled up with this\r\nmatter, and will, in all probability, finally be obliterated by it.\r\n\r\n219. One portion of the motion of a glacier is due to this bodily\r\nsliding of the mass over its bed.\r\n\r\n220. We have seen in our journeys over the glacier streams formed by\r\nthe melting of the ice, and escaping through cracks and _crevasses_\r\nto the bed of the glacier. The fine matter ground down is thus washed\r\naway; the bed is kept lubricated, and the sliding of the ice rendered\r\nmore easy than it would otherwise be.\r\n\r\n221. As a skater also you know how much ice is weakened by a thaw.\r\nBefore it actually melts it becomes rotten and unsafe. Test such ice\r\nwith your penknife: you can dig the blade readily into it, or cut the\r\nice with ease. Try good sound ice in the same way: you find it much\r\nmore resistant. The one, indeed, resembles soft chalk; the other hard\r\nstone.\r\n\r\n222. Now the Mer de Glace in summer is in this thawing condition. Its\r\nice is rendered soft and yielding by the sun; its motion is thereby\r\nfacilitated. We have seen that not only does the glacier slide over\r\nits bed, but that the upper layers slide over the under ones, and\r\nthat the centre slides past the sides. The softer and more yielding\r\nthe ice is, the more free will be this motion, and the more readily\r\nalso will it be forced through a defile like Trélaporte.\r\n\r\n223. But in winter the thaw ceases; the quantity of water reaching\r\nthe bed of the glacier is diminished or entirely cut off. The\r\nice also, to a certain depth at least, is frozen hard. These\r\nconsiderations would justify the opinion that in winter the glacier,\r\nif it moves at all, must move more slowly than in summer. At all\r\nevents, the summer measurements give no clue to the winter motion.\r\n\r\n224. This point merits examination. I will not, however, ask you to\r\nvisit the Alps in mid-winter; but, if you allow me, I will be your\r\ndeputy to the mountains, and report to you faithfully the aspect of\r\nthe region and the behaviour of the ice.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 32. _Winter on the Mer de Glace._\r\n\r\n225. The winter chosen is an inclement one. There is snow in London,\r\nsnow in Paris, snow in Geneva; snow near Chamouni so deep that the\r\nroad fences are entirely effaced. On Christmas night--nearly at\r\nmid-night--1859, your deputy reaches Chamouni.\r\n\r\n226. The snow fell heavily on December 26; but on the 27th, during a\r\nlull in the storm, we turn out. There are with me four good guides\r\nand a porter. They tie planks to their feet to prevent them from\r\nsinking in the snow; I neglect this precaution and sink often to the\r\nwaist. Four or five times during our ascent the slope cracks with an\r\nexplosive sound, and the snow threatens to come down in avalanches.[D]\r\n\r\n[D] Four years later, viz. in the spring of 1863, a mighty climber\r\nand noble guide and companion of mine, named Johann Joseph Bennen,\r\nwas lost, through the cracking and subsequent slipping of snow on\r\nsuch a slope.\r\n\r\nThe freshly-fallen snow was in that particular condition which causes\r\nits granules to adhere, and hence every flake falling on the trees\r\nhad been retained there. The laden pines presented beautiful and\r\noften fantastic forms.\r\n\r\n227. After five hours and a half of arduous work the Montanvert was\r\nattained. We unlocked the forsaken auberge, round which the snow\r\nwas reared in buttresses. I have already spoken of the complex play\r\nof crystallising forces. The frost figures on the window-panes of\r\nthe auberge were wonderful: mimic shrubs and ferns wrought by the\r\nbuilding power while hampered by the adhesion between the glass and\r\nthe film in which it worked. The appearance of the glacier was very\r\nimpressive; all sounds were stilled. The cascades which in summer\r\nfill the air with their music were silent, hanging from the ledges\r\nof the rocks in fluted columns of ice. The surface of the glacier\r\nwas obviously higher than it had been in summer; suggesting the\r\nthought that while the winter cold maintained the lower end of the\r\nglacier jammed between its boundaries, the upper portions still moved\r\ndownwards and thickened the ice. The peak of the Aiguille du Dru\r\nshook out a cloud-banner, the origin and nature of which have been\r\nalready explained (84). (See _Frontispiece_.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SNOW-LADEN PINE-TREE.]\r\n\r\n228. On the morning of the 28th this banner was strikingly large and\r\ngrand, and reddened by the light of the rising sun, it glowed like a\r\nflame. Roses of cloud also clustered round the crests of the Grande\r\nJorasse and hung upon the pinnacles of Charmoz. Four men, well roped\r\ntogether, descended to the glacier. I had trained one of them in\r\n1857, and he was now to fix the stakes. The storm had so distributed\r\nthe snow as to leave alternate lengths of the glacier bare and\r\nthickly covered. Where much snow lay great caution was required, for\r\nhidden crevasses were underneath. The men sounded with their staffs\r\nat every step. Once while looking at the party through my telescope\r\nthe leader suddenly disappeared; the roof of a crevasse had given\r\nway beneath him; but the other three men promptly gathered round and\r\nlifted him out of the fissure. The true line was soon picked up by\r\nthe theodolite; one by one the stakes were fixed until a series of\r\neleven of them stood across the glacier.\r\n\r\n229. To get higher up the valley was impracticable; the snow was\r\ntoo deep, and the aspect of the weather too threatening; so the\r\ntheodolite was planted amid the pines a Little way below the\r\nMontanvert, whence through a vista I could see across the glacier.\r\nThe men were wrapped at intervals by whirling snow-wreaths which\r\nquite hid them, and we had to take advantage of the lulls in the\r\nwind. Fitfully it came up the valley, darkening the air, catching the\r\nsnow upon the glacier, and tossing it throughout its entire length\r\ninto high and violently agitated clouds, separated from each other\r\nby cloudless spaces corresponding to the naked portions of the ice.\r\nIn the midst of this turmoil the men continued to work. Bravely and\r\nsteadfastly stake after stake was set, until at length a series of\r\nten of them was fixed across the glacier.\r\n\r\n230. Many of the stakes were fixed in the snow. They were four feet\r\nin length, and were driven in to a depth of about three feet. But\r\nthat night, while listening to the wild onset of the storm, I thought\r\nit possible that the stakes and the snow which held them might be\r\ncarried bodily away before the morning. The wind, however, lulled.\r\nWe rose with the dawn, but the air was thick with descending snow.\r\nIt was all composed of those exquisite six-petaled flowers, or\r\nsix-rayed stars, which have been already figured and described (§\r\n9). The weather brightening, the theodolite was planted at the end\r\nof the first line. The men descended, and, trained by their previous\r\nexperience, rapidly executed the measurements. The first line was\r\ncompleted before 11 A. M. Again the snow began to fall, filling\r\nall the air. Spangles innumerable were showered upon the heights.\r\nContrary to expectation, the men could be seen and directed through\r\nthe shower.\r\n\r\n231. To reach the position occupied by the theodolite at the end of\r\nour second line, I had to wade breast-deep through snow which seemed\r\nas dry and soft as flour. The toil of the men upon the glacier in\r\nbreaking through the snow was prodigious. But they did not flinch,\r\nand after a time the leader stood behind the farthest stake, and\r\ncried, _Nous avons fini_. I was surprised to hear him so distinctly,\r\nfor falling snow had been thought very deadening to sound. The work\r\nwas finished, and I struck my theodolite with a feeling of a general\r\nwho had won a small battle.\r\n\r\n232. We put the house in order, packed up, and shot by glissade down\r\nthe steep slopes of _La Filia_ to the vault of the Arveiron. We found\r\nthe river feeble, but not dried up. Many weeks must have elapsed\r\nsince any water had been sent down from the surface of the glacier.\r\nBut at the setting in of winter the fissures were in a great measure\r\ncharged with water; and the Arveiron of to-day was probably due to\r\nthe gradual _drainage_ of the glacier. There was now no danger of\r\nentering the vault, for the ice seemed as firm as marble. In the\r\ncavern we were bathed by blue light. The strange beauty of the place\r\nsuggested magic, and put me in mind of stories about fairy caves\r\nwhich I had read when a boy. At the source of the Arveiron our winter\r\nvisit to the Mer de Glace ends; next morning your deputy was on his\r\nway to London.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 33. _Winter Motion of the Mer de Glace._\r\n\r\n233. Here are the measurements executed in the winter of 1859:--\r\n\r\nLine No. I.\r\n\r\n  Stake  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11\r\n  Inches 7 11 14 13 14 14 16 16 12 12  7\r\n\r\nLine No. II.\r\n\r\n  Stake  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\r\n  Inches 8 10 14 16 16 16 18 17 15 14\r\n\r\n234. Thus the winter motion of the Mer de Glace near the Montanvert\r\nis, in round numbers, half the summer motion.\r\n\r\n235. As in summer, the eastern side of the glacier at this place\r\nmoved quicker than the western.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 34. Motion of the Grindelwald and Aletsch Glaciers.\r\n\r\n236. As regards the question of motion, to no other glacier have we\r\ndevoted ourselves with such thoroughness as to the Mer de Glace; we\r\nare, however, able to add a few measurements of other celebrated\r\nglaciers. Rear the village of Grindelwald in the Bernese Oberland,\r\nthere are two great ice-streams called respectively the Upper and the\r\nLower Grindelwald glaciers, the second of which is frequently visited\r\nby travellers in the Alps. Across it on August 6, 1860, a series of\r\ntwelve stakes was fixed by Mr. Vaughan Hawkins and myself. Measured\r\non the 8th and reduced to its daily rate, the motion of these stakes\r\nwas as follows:--\r\n\r\nMOTION OF LOWER GRINDELWALD GLACIER.\r\n\r\n  Stake   1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12\r\n  Inches 18 19 20 21 21 21 22 20 19 18 17 14\r\n\r\n237. The theodolite was here planted a little below the footway\r\nleading to the higher glacier region, and at about a mile above\r\nthe end of the glacier. The measurement was rendered difficult by\r\ncrevasses.\r\n\r\n238. The largest glacier in Switzerland is the Great Aletsch, to\r\nwhich further reference shall subsequently be made. Across it on\r\nAugust 14, 1860, a series of thirty-four stakes was planted by Mr.\r\nHawkins and me. Measured on the 16th and reduced to their daily rate,\r\nthe velocities were found to be as follows:--\r\n\r\nMOTION OF GREAT ALETSCH GLACIER.\r\n\r\n          East\r\n  Stake    1 2 3 4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12\r\n  Inches   2 3 4 6  8 11 13 14 16 17 17 19\r\n  Stake   13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23\r\n  Inches  19 18 18 17 19 19 19 19 17 17 15\r\n  Stake   24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34\r\n  Inches  16 17 17 17 17 17 17 17 16 12 12\r\n                                      West\r\n\r\n239. The maximum motion here is nineteen inches a day. Probably the\r\neastern side of the glacier is shallow, the retardation of the bed\r\nmaking the motion of the eastern stakes inconsiderable. The width of\r\nthe glacier here is 9,030 links, or about a mile and a furlong. The\r\ntheodolite was planted high among the rocks on the western flank of\r\nthe mountain, about half a mile above the Märgelin See.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 35. _Motion of Morteratsch Glacier._\r\n\r\n240. Far to the east of the Oberland and in that interesting part\r\nof Switzerland known as the Ober Engadin, stands a noble group of\r\nmountains, less in height than those of the Oberland, but still\r\nof commanding elevation. The group derives its name from its most\r\ndominant peak, the Piz Bernina. To reach the place we travel by\r\nrailway from Basel to Zürich, and from Zürich to Chur (French Coire),\r\nwhence we pass by diligence over either the Albula pass or the Julier\r\npass to the village of Pontresina. Here we are in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the Bernina mountains.\r\n\r\n241. From Pontresina we may walk or drive along a good coach road\r\nover the Bernina pass into Italy. At about an hour above the village\r\nyou would look from the road into the heart of the mountains, the\r\nline of vision passing through a valley, in which is couched a\r\nglacier of considerable size. Along its back you would trace a medial\r\nmoraine, and you could hardly fail to notice how the moraine, from a\r\nmere narrow streak at first, widens gradually as it descends, until\r\nfinally it quite covers the lower end of the glacier. Nor is this an\r\neffect of perspective; for were you to stand upon the mountain slopes\r\nwhich nourish the glacier, you would see thence also the widening\r\nof the streak of rubbish, though the perspective here would tend to\r\nnarrow the moraine as it retreats downwards.\r\n\r\n242. The ice-stream here referred to is the Morteratsch glacier, the\r\nend of which is a short hour's walk from the village of Pontresina.\r\nWe have now to determine its rate of motion and to account for the\r\nwidening of its medial moraine.\r\n\r\n243. In the summer of 1864 Mr. Hirst and myself set out three lines\r\nof stakes across the glacier. The first line crossed the ice high up;\r\nthe second a good distance lower down, and the third lower still.\r\nEven the third line, however, was at a considerable distance above\r\nthe actual snout of the glacier. The daily motion of these three\r\nlines was as follows:--\r\n\r\nFirst Line.\r\n\r\n  Stake      1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11\r\n  Inches     8 12 13 13 14 13 12 12 10  7  5\r\n\r\nSecond Line.\r\n\r\n  Stake      1 2 3 4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11\r\n  Inches     1 4 6 8 10 11 11 11 11 11 11\r\n\r\nThird Line.\r\n\r\n  Stake      1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11\r\n  Inches     1 2 4 5 6 6 7 7 5  5  4\r\n\r\n244. Compare these lines together. You notice the velocity of the\r\nfirst is greater than that of the second, and the velocity of the\r\nsecond greater than that of the third.\r\n\r\n245. The lines were permitted to move down wards for 100 hours,\r\nat the end of which time the spaces passed over by the points of\r\nswiftest motion of the three lines were as follows:\r\n\r\nMaximum Motion in 100 Hours.\r\n\r\n  First line  56 inches.\r\n  Second line 45   \"\r\n  Third line  30   \"\r\n\r\n246. Here then is a demonstration that the upper portions of the\r\nMorteratsch glacier are advancing on the lower ones. _In 1871 the\r\nmotion of a point on the middle of the glacier near its snout was\r\nfound to be less than two inches a day!_\r\n\r\n247. What, then, is the consequence of this swifter march of\r\nthe upper glacier? Obviously to squeeze this medial moraine\r\nlongitudinally, and to cause it to spread out laterally. We have here\r\ndistinctly revealed the cause of the widening of the medial moraine.\r\n\r\n248. It has been a question much discussed, whether a glacier is\r\ncompetent to scoop out or deepen a valley through which it moves, and\r\nthis very Morteratsch glacier has been cited to prove that such is\r\nnot the case. Observers went to the snout of the glacier, and finding\r\nit sensibly quiescent, they concluded that no scooping occurred. But\r\nthose who contended for the power of glaciers to excavate valleys\r\nnever stated, or meant to state, that it was the snout of the\r\nglacier which did the work. In the Morteratsch glacier the work of\r\nexcavation, which certainly goes on to a greater or less extent,\r\nmust be far more effectual high up the valley than at the end of the\r\nglacier.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 36. _Birth of a Crevasse: Reflections._\r\n\r\n249. Preserving the notion that we are working together, we will\r\nnow enter upon a new field of enquiry. We have wrapped up our\r\nchain, and are turning homewards after a hard day's work upon the\r\nGlacier du Géant, when under our feet, as if coming from the body\r\nof the glacier, an explosion is heard. Somewhat startled, we look\r\nenquiringly over the ice. The sound is repeated, several shots\r\nbeing fired in quick succession. They seem sometimes to our right,\r\nsometimes to our left, giving the impression that the glacier is\r\nbreaking all round us. Still nothing is to be seen.\r\n\r\n250. We closely scan the ice, and after an hour's strict search\r\nwe discover the cause of the reports. They announce the birth of\r\na crevasse. Through a pool upon the glacier we notice air bubbles\r\nascending, and find the bottom of the pool crossed by a narrow crack,\r\nfrom which the bubbles issue. Eight and left from this pool we trace\r\nthe young fissure through long distances. It is sometimes almost\r\ntoo feeble to be seen, and at no place is it wide enough to admit a\r\nknife-blade.\r\n\r\n251. It is difficult to believe that the formidable fissures among\r\nwhich you and I have so often trodden with awe, could commence in\r\nthis small way. Such, however, is the case. The great and gaping\r\nchasms on and above the ice-falls of the Géant and the Talèfre\r\nbegin as narrow cracks, which open gradually to crevasses. We are\r\nthus taught in an instructive and impressive way that appearances\r\nsuggestive of very violent action may really be produced by processes\r\nso slow as to require refined observations to detect them. In the\r\nproduction of natural phenomena two things always come into play, the\r\n_intensity_ of the acting force, and the _time_ during which it acts.\r\nMake the intensity great, and the time small, and you have sudden\r\nconvulsion; but precisely the same apparent effect may be produced\r\nby making the intensity small, and the time great. This truth is\r\nstrikingly illustrated by the Alpine ice-falls and crevasses;\r\nand many geological phenomena, which at first sight suggest\r\nviolent convulsion, may be really produced in the selfsame almost\r\nimperceptible way.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 37. _Icicles._\r\n\r\n252. The crevasses are grandest on the higher névés, where they\r\nsometimes appear as long yawning fissures, and sometimes as chasms\r\nof irregular outline. A delicate blue light shimmers from them, but\r\nthis is gradually lost in the darkness of their profounder portions.\r\nOver the edges of the chasms, and mostly over the southern edges,\r\nhangs a coping of snow, and from this depend like stalactites rows\r\nof transparent icicles, 10, 20, 30 feet long. These pendent spears\r\nconstitute one of the most beautiful features of the higher crevasses.\r\n\r\n253. How are they produced? Evidently by the thawing of the snow. But\r\nwhy, when once thawed, should the water freeze again to solid spears?\r\nYou have seen icicles pendent from a house-eave, which have been\r\nmanifestly produced by the thawing of the snow upon the roof. If we\r\nunderstand these, we shall also understand the vaster stalactites of\r\nthe Alpine crevasses.\r\n\r\n254. Gathering up such knowledge as we possess, and reflecting upon\r\nit patiently, let us found upon it, if we can, a theory of icicles.\r\n\r\n255. First, then, you are to know that the _air_ of our atmosphere\r\nis hardly heated at all by the rays of the sun, whether visible or\r\ninvisible. The air is highly transparent to all kinds of rays, and\r\nit is only the scanty fraction to which it is _not_ transparent that\r\nexpend their force in warming it.\r\n\r\n256. Not so, however, with the snow on which the sunbeams fall. It\r\nabsorbs the solar heat, and on a sunny day you may see the summits of\r\nthe high Alps glistening with the water of liquefaction. The _air_\r\nabove and around the mountains may at the same time be many degrees\r\nbelow the freezing point in temperature.\r\n\r\n257. You have only to pass from sunshine into shade to prove this. A\r\nsingle step suffices to carry you from a place where the thermometer\r\nstands high to one where it stands low; the change being due, not\r\nto any difference in the temperature of the _air_, but simply to the\r\nwithdrawal of the thermometer from the direct action of the solar\r\nrays. Nay, without shifting the thermometer at all, by interposing a\r\nsuitable screen, which cuts off the sun's rays, the coldness of the\r\nair may be demonstrated.\r\n\r\n258. Look now to the snow upon your house roof. The sun plays upon\r\nit, and melts it; the water trickles to the eave and then drops down.\r\nIf the eave face the sun the water remains water; but if the eave\r\ndo not face the sun, the drop, before it quits its parent snow, _is\r\nalready in shadow_. Now the shaded space, as we have learnt, may be\r\nbelow the freezing temperature. If so the drop, instead of falling,\r\ncongeals, and the rudiment of an icicle is formed. Other drops and\r\ndriblets succeed, which trickle over the rudiment, congeal upon it in\r\npart and _thicken_ it at the root. But a portion of the water reaches\r\nthe free end of the icicle, hangs from it, and is there congealed\r\nbefore it escapes. The icicle is thus _lengthened_. In the Alps,\r\nwhere the liquefaction is copious and the cold of the shaded crevasse\r\nintense, the icicles, though produced in the same way, naturally grow\r\nto a greater size. The drainage of the snow after the sun's power is\r\nwithdrawn also produces icicles.\r\n\r\n259. It is interesting and important that you should be able to\r\nexplain the formation of an icicle; but it is far more important\r\nthat you should realise the way in which the various threads of what\r\nwe call Nature are woven together. You cannot fully understand an\r\nicicle without first knowing that solar beams powerful enough to\r\nfuse the snows and blister the human skin, nay, it might be added,\r\npowerful enough, when concentrated, to burn up the human body itself,\r\nmay pass through the air, and still leave it at an icy temperature.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 38. _The Bergschrund._\r\n\r\n260. Having cleared away this difficulty, let us turn once more to\r\nthe crevasses, taking them in the order of their formation. First\r\nthen above the névé we have the final Alpine peaks and crests,\r\nagainst which the snow is often reared as a steep buttress. We have\r\nalready learned that both névés and glaciers are moving slowly\r\ndownwards; but it usually happens that the attachment of the highest\r\nportion of the buttress to the rocks is great enough to enable it to\r\nhold on while the lower portion breaks away. A very characteristic\r\ncrevasse is thus formed, called in the German-speaking portion of the\r\nAlps a _Bergschrund_. It often surrounds a peak like a fosse, as if\r\nto defend it against the assaults of climbers.\r\n\r\n261. Look more closely into its formation. Imagine the snow as yet\r\nunbroken. Its higher portions cling to the rocks, and move downwards\r\nwith extreme slowness. But its lower portions, whether from their\r\ngreater depth and weight, or their less perfect attachment, are\r\ncompelled to move more quickly. _A pull_ is therefore exerted,\r\ntending to separate the lower from the upper snow. For a time this\r\npull is resisted by the cohesion of the névé; but this at length\r\ngives way, and a crack is formed exactly across the line in which\r\nthe pull is exerted. In other words, _a crevasse is formed at right\r\nangles to the line of tension_.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 39. _Transverse Crevasses._\r\n\r\n262. Both on the névé and on the glacier the origin of the crevasses\r\nis the same. Through some cause or other the ice is thrown into a\r\nstate of strain, and as it cannot _stretch_ it _breaks_ across the\r\nline of tension. Take for example, the ice-fall of the Géant, or\r\nof the Talèfre, above which you know the crevasses yawn terribly.\r\nImagine the névé and the glacier entirely peeled away, so as to\r\nexpose the surface over which they move. From the Col du Géant we\r\nshould see this surface falling gently to the place now occupied by\r\nthe brow of the cascade. Here the surface would fall steeply down to\r\nthe bed of the present Glacier du Géant, where the slope would become\r\ngentle once more.\r\n\r\n263. Think of the névé moving over such a surface. It descends from\r\nthe Col till it reaches the brow just referred to. It crosses the\r\nbrow, and must bend down to keep upon its bed. Realise clearly what\r\nmust occur. The surface of the névé is evidently thrown into a\r\nstate of strain; it breaks and forms a crevasse. Each fresh portion\r\nof the névé as it passes the brow is similarly broken, and thus a\r\nsuccession of crevasses is sent down the fall. Between every two\r\nchasms is a great transverse ridge. Through local strains upon the\r\nfall those ridges are also frequently broken across, towers of\r\nice--_séracs_--being the result. Down the fall both ridges and séracs\r\nare borne, the dislocation being augmented during the descent.\r\n\r\n264. What must occur at the foot of the fall? Here the slope suddenly\r\nlessens in steepness. It is plain that the crevasses must not only\r\ncease to open here, but that they must in whole or in part close\r\nup. At the summit of the fall, the bending was such as to make the\r\nsurface convex; at the bottom of the fall the bending renders the\r\nsurface concave. In the one case we have _strain_, in the other\r\n_pressure_. In the one case, therefore, we have the _opening_, and\r\nin the other the _closing_ of crevasses. This reasoning corresponds\r\nexactly with the facts of observation.\r\n\r\n265. Lay bare your arm and stretch it straight. Make two ink dots\r\nhalf an inch or an inch apart, exactly opposite the elbow. Bend your\r\narm, the dots approach each other, and are finally brought together.\r\nLet the two dots represent the two sides of a crevasse at the bottom\r\nof an ice-fall; the bending of the arm resembles the bending of the\r\nice, and the closing up of the dots resembles the closing of the\r\nfissures.\r\n\r\n266. The same remarks apply to various portions of the Mer de Glace.\r\nAt certain places the inclination changes from a gentler to a steeper\r\nslope, and on crossing the brow between both the glacier breaks its\r\nback. _Transverse crevasses_ are thus formed. There is such a change\r\nof inclination opposite to the Angle, and a still greater but similar\r\nchange at the head of the Glacier des Bois. The consequence is that\r\nthe Mer de Glace at the former point is impassable, and at the latter\r\nthe rending and dislocation are such as we have seen and described.\r\nBelow the Angle, and at the bottom of the Glacier des Bois, the\r\nsteepness relaxes, the crevasses heal up, and the glacier becomes\r\nonce more continuous and compact.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 40. _Marginal Crevasses._\r\n\r\n267. Supposing, then, that we had no changes of inclination, should\r\nwe have no crevasses? We should certainly have less of them, but they\r\nwould not wholly disappear. For other circumstances exist to throw\r\nthe ice into a state of strain, and to determine its fracture. The\r\nprincipal of these is the more rapid movement of the centre of the\r\nglacier.\r\n\r\n268. Helped by the labours of an eminent man, now dead, the late Mr.\r\nWm. Hopkins, of Cambridge, let us master the explanation of this\r\npoint together. But the pleasure of mastering it would be enhanced\r\nif we could see beforehand the perplexing and delusive appearances\r\naccounted for by the explanation. Could my wishes be followed out, I\r\nwould at this point of our researches carry you off with me to Basel,\r\nthence to Thun, thence to Interlaken, thence to Grindelwald, where\r\nyou would find yourself in the actual presence of the Wetterhorn and\r\nthe Eiger, with all the greatest peaks of the Bernese Oberland, the\r\nFinsteraarhorn, the Schreckhorn, the Monch, the Jungfrau, at hand.\r\nAt Grindelwald, as we have already learnt, there are two well-known\r\nglaciers--the Ober Grindelwald and the Unter Grindelwald glaciers--on\r\nthe latter of which our observations should commence.\r\n\r\n269. Dropping down from the village to the bottom of the valley, we\r\nshould breast the opposite mountain, and with the great limestone\r\nprecipices of the Wetterhorn to our left, we should get upon a path\r\nwhich commands a view of the glacier. Here we should see beautiful\r\nexamples of the opening of crevasses at the summit of a brow, and\r\ntheir closing at the bottom. But the chief point of interest would\r\nbe the crevasses formed at the _side_ of this glacier--the _marginal\r\ncrevasses_, as they may be called.\r\n\r\n270. We should find the side copiously fissured, even at those places\r\nwhere the centre is compact; and we should particularly notice that\r\nthe fissures would neither run in the direction of the glacier, nor\r\nstraight across it, but that they would be _oblique_ to it, enclosing\r\nan angle of about 45 degrees with the sides. Starting from the side\r\nof the glacier the crevasses would be seen to point _upwards_; that\r\nis to say, the ends of the fissures abutting against the bounding\r\nmountain would appear to be _dragged down_. Were you less instructed\r\nthan you now are, I might lay a wager that the aspect of these\r\nfissures would cause you to conclude that the centre of the glacier\r\nis left behind by the quicker motion of the sides.\r\n\r\n271. This indeed was the conclusion drawn by M. Agassiz from this\r\nvery appearance, before he had measured the motion of the sides and\r\ncentre of the glacier of the Unteraar. Intimately versed with the\r\ntreatment of mechanical problems, Mr. Hopkins immediately deduced\r\nthe obliquity of the lateral crevasses from the quicker flow of the\r\ncentre. Standing beside the glacier with pencil and note-book in\r\nhand, I would at once make the matter clear to you thus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n272. Let A C, in the annexed figure, be one side of the glacier, and\r\nB D the other; and let the direction of motion be that indicated\r\nby the arrow. Let S T be a transverse slice of the glacier, taken\r\nstraight across it, say to-day. A few days or weeks hence this\r\nslice will have been carried down, and because the centre moves more\r\nquickly than the sides it will not remain straight, but will bend\r\ninto the form S' T'.\r\n\r\n273. Supposing T _i_ to be a small square of the original slice near\r\nthe side of the glacier. In its new position the square will be\r\ndistorted to the lozenge-shaped figure T' _i'_. Fix your attention\r\nupon the diagonal T _i_ of the square; in the lowest position this\r\ndiagonal, _if the ice could stretch_, would be lengthened to T' _i'_.\r\nBut the ice does not stretch; it breaks, and we have a crevasse\r\nformed at right angles to T' _i'_. The mere inspection of the diagram\r\nwill assure you that the crevasse will point obliquely _upwards_.\r\n\r\n274. Along the whole side of the glacier the quicker movement of the\r\ncentre produces a similar state of strain; and the consequence is\r\nthat the sides are copiously cut by those oblique crevasses, even at\r\nplaces where the centre is free from them.\r\n\r\n275. It is curious to see at other places the transverse fissures\r\nof the centre uniting with those at the sides, so as to form great\r\ncurved crevasses which stretch across the glacier from side to\r\nside. The convexity of the curve is turned _upwards_, as mechanical\r\nprinciples declare it ought to be. (See sketch on opposite page.)\r\nBut if you were ignorant of those principles, you would never infer\r\nfrom the aspect of these curves the quicker motion of the centre. In\r\nlandslips, and in the motion of partially indurated mud, you may\r\nsometimes notice appearances similar to those exhibited by the ice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKETCH OF CURVED CREVASSES: THE GLACIER MOVES FROM\r\nLEFT TO RIGHT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 41. _Longitudinal Crevasses._\r\n\r\n276. We have thus unravelled the origin of both transverse and\r\nmarginal crevasses. But where a glacier issues from a steep and\r\nnarrow defile upon a comparatively level plain which allows it room\r\nto expand laterally, its motion is in part arrested, and the level\r\nportion has to bear the thrust of the steeper portions behind. Here\r\nthe line of thrust is in the direction of the glacier, while the\r\ndirection at right angles to this is one of tension. Across this\r\nlatter the glacier breaks, and _longitudinal crevasses_ are formed.\r\n\r\n277. Examples of this kind of crevasse are furnished by the lower\r\npart of the Glacier of the Rhone, when looked down upon from the\r\nGrimsel Pass, or from any commanding point on the flanking mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 42. _Crevasses in relation to Curvature of Glacier._\r\n\r\n278. One point in addition remains to be discussed, and your present\r\nknowledge will enable you to master it in a moment. You remember at\r\nan early period of OUT researches that we crossed the Mer de Glace\r\nfrom the Chapeau side to the Montanvert side. I then desired you to\r\nnotice that the Chapeau side of the glacier was more fissured than\r\neither the centre or the Montanvert side (75). Why should this be so?\r\nKnowing as we now do that the Chapeau side of the glacier moves more\r\nquickly than the other; that the point of maximum motion does not\r\nlie on the centre but far east of it, we are prepared to answer this\r\nquestion in a perfectly satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\n279. Let A B and C D, in the diagram opposite, represent the two\r\ncurved sides of the Mer de Glace at the Montanvert, and let _m n_ be\r\na straight line across the glacier. Let _o_ be the point of maximum\r\nmotion. The mechanical state of the two sides of the glacier may be\r\nthus made plain. Supposing the line _m n_ to be a straight elastic\r\nstring with its ends fixed; let it be grasped firmly at the point\r\no by the finger and thumb, and drawn to _o'_, keeping the distance\r\nbetween _o'_ and the side C D constant. Here the length, _n o_ of\r\nthe string would have stretched to _n o'_, and the length _m o_ to\r\n_m o'_ and you see plainly that the stretching of the short line, in\r\ncomparison with its length, is greater than that of the long line in\r\ncomparison with its length. In other words, the strain upon _n o'_ is\r\ngreater than that upon _m o'_; so that if one of them were to break\r\nunder the strain, it would be the short one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Montanvert_]\r\n\r\n280. These two lines represent the conditions of strain upon the\r\ntwo sides of the glacier. The sides are held back, and the centre\r\ntries to move on, a strain being thus set up between the centre and\r\nsides. But the displacement of the point of maximum motion through\r\nthe curvature of the valley makes the strain upon the eastern ice\r\ngreater than that upon the western. The eastern side of the glacier\r\nis therefore more crevassed than the western.\r\n\r\n281. Here indeed resides the difficulty of getting along the eastern\r\nside of the Mer de Glace: a difficulty which was one reason for our\r\ncrossing the glacier opposite to the Montanvert. There are two convex\r\nsweeps on the eastern side to one on the western side, hence on the\r\nwhole the eastern side of the Mer de Glace is most riven.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 43. _Moraine-ridges, Glacier Tables, and Sand-Cones._\r\n\r\n282. When you and I first crossed the Mer de Glace from Trélaporte\r\nto the Couvercle, we found that the stripes of rocks and rubbish\r\nwhich constituted the medial moraines were ridges raised above the\r\ngeneral level of the glacier to a height at some places of twenty or\r\nthirty feet. On examining these ridges we found the rubbish to be\r\nsuperficial, and that it rested upon a great spine of ice which ran\r\nalong the back of the glacier. By what means has this ridge of ice\r\nbeen raised?\r\n\r\n283. Most boys have read the story of Dr. Franklin's placing bits of\r\ncloth of various colours upon snow on a sunny day. The bits of cloth\r\nsank in the snow, the dark ones most.\r\n\r\n284. Consider this experiment. The sun's rays first of all fall\r\nupon the upper surface of the cloth and warm it. The heat is then\r\nconducted through the cloth to the under surface, and the under\r\nsurface passes it on to the snow, which is finally liquefied by the\r\nheat. It is quite manifest that the quantity of snow melted will\r\naltogether depend upon the amount of heat sent from the upper to the\r\nunder surface of the cloth.\r\n\r\n285. Now cloth is what is called a bad conductor. It does not permit\r\nheat to travel freely through it. But where it has merely to pass\r\nthrough the thickness of a single bit of cloth, a good quantity of\r\nthe heat gets through. But if you double or treble or quintuple the\r\nthickness of the cloth; or, what is easier, if you put several pieces\r\none upon the other, you come at length to a point where no sensible\r\namount of heat could get through from the upper to the under surface.\r\n\r\n286. What must occur if such a thick piece, or such a series of\r\npieces of cloth, were placed upon snow on which a strong sun is\r\nfalling? The snow round the cloth is melted, but that underneath the\r\ncloth is protected. If the action continue long enough the inevitable\r\nresult will be, that the level of the snow all round the cloth will\r\nsink, and the cloth will be left behind perched upon an eminence of\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\n287. If you understand this, you have already mastered the cause of\r\nthe moraine-ridges. They are not produced by any swelling of the ice\r\nupwards. But the ice underneath the rocks and rubbish being protected\r\nfrom the sun, the glacier right and left melts away and leaves a\r\nridge behind.\r\n\r\n288. Various other appearances upon the glacier are accounted for\r\nin the same way. Here upon the Mer de Glace we have flat slabs of\r\nrock sometimes lifted up on pillars of ice. These are the so-called\r\n_Glacier Tables_. They are produced, not by the growth of a stalk of\r\nice out of the glacier, but by the melting of the glacier all round\r\nthe ice protected by the stone. Here is a sketch of one of the Tables\r\nof the Mer de Glace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n289. Notice moreover that a glacier table is hardly ever set square\r\nupon its pillar. It generally leans to one side, and repeated\r\nobservation teaches you that it so leans as to enable you always to\r\ndraw the north and south line upon the glacier. For the sun being\r\nsouth of the zenith at noon pours its rays against the southern end\r\nof the table, while the northern end remains in shadow. The southern\r\nend, therefore, being most warmed does not protect the ice underneath\r\nit so effectually as the northern end. The table becomes inclined,\r\nand ends by sliding bodily off its pedestal.\r\n\r\n290. In the figure opposite we have what maybe called an ideal\r\nTable. The oblique lines represent the direction of the sunbeams,\r\nand the consequent tilting of the table here shown resembles that\r\nobserved upon the glaciers.\r\n\r\n291. A pebble will not rise thus: like Franklin's single bit of\r\ncloth, a dark-coloured pebble sinks in the ice. A spot of black mould\r\nwill not rest upon the surface, but will sink; and various parts of\r\nthe Glacier du Géant are honeycombed by the sinking of such spots of\r\ndirt into the ice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n292. But when the dirt is of a thickness sufficient to protect the\r\nice the case is different. Sand is often washed away by a stream from\r\nthe mountains, or from the moraines, and strewn over certain spaces\r\nof the glacier. A most curious action follows: the sanded surface\r\nrises, the part on which the sand lies thickest rising highest.\r\nLittle peaks and eminences jut forth, and when the distribution\r\nof the sand is favourable, and the action sufficiently prolonged,\r\nyou have little mountains formed, sometimes singly, and sometimes\r\ngrouped so as to mimic the Alps themselves. The _Sand-Cones_ of the\r\nMer de Glace are not striking; but on the Görner, the Aletsch, the\r\nMorteratsch, and other glaciers, they form singly and in groups,\r\nreaching sometimes a height of ten or twenty feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 44. _The Glacier Mills or Moulins._\r\n\r\n293. You and I have learned by long experience the character of the\r\nMer de Glace. We have marched over it daily, with a definite object\r\nin view, but we have not closed our eyes to other objects. It is\r\nfrom side glimpses of things which are not at the moment occupying\r\nour attention that fresh subjects of enquiry arise in scientific\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n294. Thus in marching over the ice near Trélaporte we were often\r\nstruck by a sound resembling low rumbling thunder. We subsequently\r\nsought out the origin of this sound, and found it.\r\n\r\n295. A large area of this portion of the glacier is unbroken.\r\nDriblets of water have room to form rills; rills to unite and form\r\nstreams; streams to combine to form rushing brooks, which sometimes\r\ncut deep channels in the ice. Sooner or later these streams reach\r\na strained portion of the glacier, where a crack is formed across\r\nthe stream. A way is thus opened for the water to the bottom of the\r\nglacier. By long action the stream hollows out a shaft, the crack\r\nthus becoming the starting-point of a funnel of unseen depth, into\r\nwhich the water leaps with the sound of thunder.\r\n\r\n296. This funnel and its cataract form a glacier Mill or _Moulin_.\r\n\r\n297. Let me grasp your hand firmly while you stand upon the edge of\r\nthis shaft and look into it. The hole, with its pure blue shimmer,\r\nis beautiful, but it is terrible. Incautious persons have fallen\r\ninto these shafts, a second or two of bewilderment being followed by\r\nsudden death. But caution upon the glaciers and mountains ought, by\r\nhabit, to be made a second nature to explorers like you and me.\r\n\r\n298. The crack into which the stream first descended to form the\r\nmoulin, moves down with the glacier. A succeeding portion of the ice\r\nreaches the place where the breaking strain is exerted. A new crack\r\nis then formed above the moulin, which is thenceforth forsaken by the\r\nstream, and moves downward as an empty shaft. Here upon the Mer de\r\nGlace, in advance of the _Grand Moulin_, we see no less than six of\r\nthese forsaken holes. Some of them we sound to a depth of 90 feet.\r\n\r\n299. But you and I both wish to determine, if possible, the entire\r\ndepth of the Mer de Glace. The Grand Moulin offers a chance of doing\r\nthis which we must not neglect. Our first effort to sound the moulin\r\nfails through the breaking of our cord by the impetuous plunge of the\r\nwater. A lump of grease in the hollow of a weight enables a mariner\r\nto judge of a sea bottom. We employ such a weight, but cannot reach\r\nthe bed of the glacier. A depth of 163 feet is the utmost reached by\r\nour plummet.\r\n\r\n300. From July 28 to August 8 we have watched the progress of the\r\nGrand Moulin. On the former date the position of the Moulin was\r\nfixed. On the 31st it had moved down 50 inches; a little more than\r\na day afterwards it had moved 74 inches. On August 8 it had moved\r\n198 inches, which gives an average of about 18 inches in twenty-four\r\nhours. No doubt next summer upon the Mer de Glace a Grand Moulin will\r\nbe found thundering near Trélaporte; but like the crevasse of the\r\nGrand Plateau, already referred to (§ 16), it will not be our Moulin.\r\nThis, or rather the ice which it penetrated, is now probably more\r\nthan a mile lower down than it was in 1857.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 45. _The Changes of Volume of Water by Heat and Cold._\r\n\r\n301. We have noticed upon the glacier shafts and pits filled with\r\nwater of the most delicate blue. In some cases these have been the\r\nshafts of extinct moulins closed at the bottom. A theory has been\r\nadvanced to account for them, which, though it may be untenable,\r\nopens out considerations regarding the properties of water that\r\nought to be familiar to enquirers like you and me.\r\n\r\n302. In our dissection of lake ice by a beam of heat (§ 11) we\r\nnoticed little vacuous spots at the centres of the liquid flowers\r\nformed by the beam. These spots we referred to the fact that when ice\r\nis melted the water produced is less in volume than the ice, and that\r\nhence the water of the flower was not able to occupy the whole space\r\ncovered by the flower.\r\n\r\n303. Let us more fully illustrate this subject. Stop a small flask\r\nwater-tight with a cork, and through the cork introduce a narrow\r\nglass tube also water-tight. It is easy to fill the flask with water\r\nso that the liquid shall stand at a certain height in the glass tube.\r\n\r\n304. Let us now warm the flask with the flame of a spirit-lamp. On\r\nfirst applying the flame you notice a momentary sinking of the liquid\r\nin the glass tube. This is due to the momentary expansion of the\r\nflask by heat; it becomes suddenly larger when the flame is first\r\napplied.\r\n\r\n305. But the expansion of the water soon overtakes that of the flask\r\nand surpasses it. We immediately see the rise of the liquid column\r\nin the glass tube, exactly as mercury rises in the tube of a warmed\r\nthermometer.\r\n\r\n306. Our glass tube is ten inches long, and at starting the water\r\nstood in it at a height of five inches. We will apply the spirit-lamp\r\nflame until the water rises quite to the top of the tube and trickles\r\nover. This experiment suffices to show the expansion of the water by\r\nheat.\r\n\r\n307. We now take a common finger-glass and put into it a little\r\npounded ice and salt. On this we place the flask, and then build\r\nround it the freezing mixture. The liquid column retreats down the\r\ntube, proving the contraction of the liquid by cold. We allow the\r\nshrinking to continue for some minutes, noticing that the downward\r\nretreat of the liquid becomes gradually slower, and that it finally\r\nceases altogether.\r\n\r\n308. Keep your eye upon the liquid column; it remains quiescent for\r\na fraction of a minute, and then moves once more. But its motion is\r\nnow _upwards_ instead of downwards. _The freezing mixture now acts\r\nexactly like the flame._\r\n\r\n309. It would not be difficult to pass a thermometer through the cork\r\ninto the flask, and it would tell us the exact temperature at which\r\nthe liquid ceased to contract and began to expand. At that moment we\r\nshould find the temperature of the liquid a shade over 39° Fahr.\r\n\r\n310. At this temperature, then, water attains _its maximum density_.\r\n\r\n311. Seven degrees below this temperature, or at 32° Fahr., the\r\nliquid begins to turn into solid crystals of ice, which you know\r\nswims upon water because it is bulkier for a given weight. In fact,\r\nthis halt of the approaching molecules at the temperature of 39°,\r\nis but the preparation for the subsequent act of crystallisation,\r\nin which the expansion by cold culminates. Up to the point of\r\nsolidification the increase of volume is slow and gradual; while in\r\nthe act of solidification it is sudden, and of overwhelming strength.\r\n\r\n312. By this force of expansion the Florentine Academicians long\r\nago burst a sphere of copper nearly three quarters of an inch in\r\nthickness. By the same force the celebrated astronomer Huyghens burst\r\nin 1667 iron cannons a finger breadth thick. Such experiments have\r\nbeen frequently made since. Major Williams during a severe Quebec\r\nwinter filled a mortar with water, and closed it by driving into\r\nits muzzle a plug of wood. Exposed to a temperature 50° Fahr. below\r\nthe freezing point of water, the metal resisted the strain, but the\r\nplug gave way, being projected to a distance of 400 feet. At Warsaw\r\nhowitzer shells have been thus exploded; and you and I have shivered\r\nthick bombshells to fragments, by placing them for half an hour in a\r\nfreezing mixture.\r\n\r\n313. The theory of the shafts and pits referred to at the beginning\r\nof this section is this: The water at the surface of the shaft is\r\nwarmed by the sun, say to a temperature of 39° Fahr. The water at\r\nthe bottom, in contact with the ice, must be at 32° or near it. The\r\nheavier water is therefore at the top; it will descend to the bottom,\r\nmelt the ice there, and thus deepen the shaft.\r\n\r\n314. The circulation here referred to undoubtedly goes on, and\r\nsome curious effects are due to it; but not, I think, the one here\r\nascribed to it. The _deepening_ of a shaft implies a quicker melting\r\nof its bottom than of the surface of the glacier. It is not easy to\r\nsee how the fact of the solar heat being first absorbed by water,\r\nand then conveyed by it to the bottom of the shaft, should make the\r\nmelting of the bottom more rapid than that of the ice which receives\r\nthe direct impact of the solar rays. The surface of the glacier must\r\nsink _at least_ as rapidly as the bottom of the pit, so that the\r\ncirculation, though actually existing, cannot produce the effect\r\nascribed to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 46. _Consequences flowing from the foregoing Properties of Water.\r\nCorrection of Errors._\r\n\r\n315. I was not much above your age when the property of water ceasing\r\nto contract by cold at a temperature of 39° Fahr. was made known to\r\nme, and I still remember the impression it made upon me. For I was\r\nasked to consider what would occur in case this solitary exception to\r\nan otherwise universal law ceased to exist.\r\n\r\n316. I was asked to reflect upon the condition of a lake stored with\r\nfish and offering its surface to very cold air. It was made clear\r\nto me that the water on being first chilled would shrink in volume\r\nand become heavier, that it would therefore sink and have its place\r\nsupplied by the warmer and lighter water from the deeper portions of\r\nthe lake.\r\n\r\n317. It was pointed out to me that without the law referred to\r\nthis process of circulation would go on until the whole water of\r\nthe lake had been lowered to the freezing temperature. Congelation\r\nwould then begin, and would continue as long as any water remained\r\nto be solidified. One consequence of this would be to destroy every\r\nliving thing contained in the lake. Other calamities were added,\r\nall of which were said to be prevented by the perfectly exceptional\r\narrangement, that after a certain time the _colder_ water becomes the\r\n_lighter_, floats on the surface of the lake, is there congealed,\r\nthus throwing a protecting roof over the life below.\r\n\r\n318. Count Rumford, one of the most solid of scientific men, writes\r\nin the following strain about this question:--\"It does not appear to\r\nme that there is anything which human sagacity can fathom, within the\r\nwide-extended bounds of the visible creation, which affords a more\r\nstriking or more palpable proof of the wisdom of the Creator, and\r\nof the special care He has taken in the general arrangement of the\r\nuniverse, to preserve animal life, than this wonderful contrivance.\r\n\r\n319. \"Let me beg the attention of my readers while I endeavour to\r\ninvestigate this most interesting subject; and let me at the same\r\ntime bespeak his candour and indulgence. I feel the danger to which a\r\nmortal exposes himself who has the temerity to explain the designs\r\nof Infinite Wisdom. The enterprise is adventurous, but it surely\r\ncannot be improper.\r\n\r\n320. \"Had not Providence interfered on this occasion in a manner\r\nwhich may well be considered as _miraculous_, all the fresh water\r\nwithin the polar circle must inevitably have been frozen to a very\r\ngreat depth in winter, and every plant and tree destroyed.\"\r\n\r\n321. Through many pages of his book Count Rumford continues in this\r\nstrain to expound the ways and intentions of the Almighty, and he\r\ndoes not hesitate to apply very harsh words to those who cannot\r\nshare his notions. He calls them hardened and degraded. We are here\r\nwarned of the fact, which is too often forgotten, that the pleasure\r\nor comfort of a belief, or the warmth or exaltation of feeling which\r\nit produces, is no guarantee of its truth. For the whole of Count\r\nRumford's delight and enthusiasm in connexion with this subject, and\r\nthe whole of his ire against those who did not share his opinions,\r\nwere founded upon an erroneous notion.\r\n\r\n322. Water is _not_ a solitary exception to an otherwise general law.\r\nThere are other molecules than those of this liquid which require\r\nmore room in the solid crystalline condition than in the adjacent\r\nmolten condition. Iron is a case in point. Solid iron floats upon\r\nmolten iron exactly as ice floats upon water. Bismuth is a still\r\nmore impressive case, and we could shiver a bomb as certainly by the\r\nsolidification of bismuth as by that of water. There is no fish, to\r\nbe taken care of here, still the \"contrivance\" is the same.\r\n\r\n323. I am reluctant to mention them in the same breath with Count\r\nRumford, but I am told that in our own day there are people who\r\nprofess to find the comforts of a religion in a superstition lower\r\nthan any that has hitherto degraded the civilized human mind. So that\r\nthe _happiness_ of a faith and the _truth_ of a faith are two totally\r\ndifferent things.\r\n\r\n324. Life and the conditions of life are in necessary harmony. This\r\nis a truism, for without the suitable conditions life could not\r\nexist. But both life and its conditions set forth the operations of\r\ninscrutable Power. We know not its origin; we know not its end. And\r\nthe presumption, if not the degradation, rests with those who place\r\nupon the throne of the universe a magnified image of themselves, and\r\nmake its doings a mere colossal imitation of their own.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 47. _The Molecular Mechanism of Water-Congelation._\r\n\r\n325. But let us return to our science. How are we to picture this act\r\nof expansion on the part of freezing water? By what operation do the\r\nmolecules demand with such irresistible emphasis more room in the\r\nsolid than in the adjacent liquid condition? In all cases of this\r\nkind we must derive our conceptions from the world of the senses, and\r\ntransfer them afterwards to a world transcending the range of the\r\nsenses.\r\n\r\n326. You have not forgotten our conversation regarding \"atomic\r\npoles\" (§ 10), and how the notion of polar force came to be applied\r\nto crystals. With this fresh in your memory, you will have no great\r\ndifficulty in understanding how expansion of volume may accompany the\r\nact of crystallisation.\r\n\r\n327. I place a number of magnets before you. They, as matter, are\r\naffected by gravity, and, if perfectly free, they would move towards\r\neach other in obedience to the attraction of gravity.\r\n\r\n328. But they are not only matter, but _magnetic_ matter. They not\r\nonly act upon each other by the simple force of gravity, but by the\r\npolar force of magnetism. Imagine them placed at a distance from each\r\nother, and perfectly free to move. Gravity first makes itself felt\r\nand draws them together. For a time the magnetic force issuing from\r\nthe poles is insensible; but when a certain nearness is attained, the\r\npolar force comes into play. The mutually attracting points close up,\r\nthe mutually repellent points retreat, and it is easy to see that\r\nthis action may produce an arrangement of the magnets which requires\r\nmore room. Suppose them surrounded by a box which exactly encloses\r\nthem at the moment the polar force first comes into play. It is easy\r\nto see that in arranging themselves subsequently the repelled corners\r\nand ends of the magnets may be caused to press against the sides of\r\nthe box, and even to burst it, if the forces be sufficiently strong.\r\n\r\n329. Here then we have a conception which may be applied to the\r\nmolecules of water. They, like the magnets, are acted upon by two\r\ndistinct forces. For a time while the liquid is being cooled they\r\napproach each other, in obedience to their general attraction for\r\neach other. But at a certain point new forces, some attractive,\r\nsome repulsive, _emanating from special points_ of the molecules,\r\ncome into play. The attracted points close up, the repelled points\r\nretreat. Thus the molecules turn and rearrange themselves, demanding,\r\nas they do so, more space, and overcoming all ordinary resistance by\r\nthe energy of their demand. This, in general terms, is an explanation\r\nof the expansion of water in solidifying: it would be easy to\r\nconstruct an apparatus for its illustration.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 48. _The Dirt Bands of the Mer de Glace._\r\n\r\n330. Pass from bright sunshine into a moderately lighted room; for a\r\ntime all appears so dark that the objects in the room are not to be\r\nclearly distinguished. Hit violently by the waves of light (§ 3) the\r\noptic nerve is numbed, and requires time to recover its sensitiveness.\r\n\r\n331. It is for this reason that I choose the present hour for a\r\nspecial observation on the Mer de Glace. The sun has sunk behind the\r\nridge of Charmoz, and the surface of the glacier is in sober shade.\r\nThe main portion of our day's work is finished, but we have still\r\nsufficient energy to climb the slopes adjacent to the Montanvert to\r\na height of a thousand feet or thereabouts above the ice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n332. We now look fairly down upon the glacier, and see it less\r\nforeshortened than from the Montanvert. We notice the diet\r\noverspreading its eastern side, due to the crowding together of\r\nits medial moraines. We see the comparatively clean surface of the\r\nGlacier du Géant; but we notice upon this surface an appearance\r\nwhich we have not hitherto seen. It is crossed by a series of grey\r\nbent bands, which follow each other in succession, from Trélaporte\r\ndownwards. We count eighteen of these from our present position. (See\r\nsketch, page 128.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n333. These are the _Dirt Bands_ of the Mer de Glace; they were first\r\nobserved by Professor Forbes in 1842.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n334. They extend down the glacier further than we can see; and if we\r\ncross the valley of Chamouni, and climb the mountains at the opposite\r\nside, to a point near the little auberge, called La Flégère, we shall\r\ncommand a view of the end of the glacier and observe the completion\r\nof the series of bands. We notice that they are confined throughout\r\nto the portion of the glacier derived from the Col du Géant. (See\r\nsketch, page 129.)\r\n\r\n335. We must trace them to their source. You know how noble and\r\ncomplete a view is obtained of the glacier and Col du Géant from the\r\nCleft Station above Trélaporte. Thither we must once more climb;\r\nand thence we can see the succession of bands stretching downwards\r\nto the Montanvert, and upwards to the base of the ice-cascade upon\r\nthe Glacier du Géant. The cascade is evidently concerned in their\r\nformation. (See sketch opposite.)\r\n\r\n336. And how? Simply enough. The glacier, as we know, is broken\r\ntransversely at the summit of the ice-fall, and descends the\r\ndeclivity in a series of great transverse ridges. At the base of the\r\nfall, the chasms are closed, but the ridges in part remain forming\r\nprotuberances, which run like vast wrinkles across the glacier. These\r\nprotuberances are more and more bent because of the quicker motion\r\nof the centre, and the depressions between them form receptacles for\r\nthe fine mud and débris washed by the little rills from the adjacent\r\nslopes.\r\n\r\n337. The protuberances sink gradually through the wasting action of\r\nthe sun, so that long before Trélaporte is reached they have wholly\r\ndisappeared. Not so the dirt of which they were the collectors: it\r\ncontinues to occupy, in transverse bands, the flat surface of the\r\nglacier. At Trélaporte, moreover, where the valley becomes narrow,\r\nthe bands are much sharpened, obtaining there the character which\r\nthey afterwards preserve throughout the Mer de Glace. Other glaciers\r\nwith cascades also exhibit similar bands.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 49. _Sea Ice and Icebergs._\r\n\r\n338. We are now equipped intellectually for a campaign into another\r\nterritory. Water becomes heavier and more difficult to freeze when\r\nsalt is dissolved in it. Sea water is therefore heavier than fresh,\r\nand the Greenland Ocean requires to freeze it a temperature 3½\r\ndegrees lower than fresh water. When concentrated till its specific\r\ngravity reaches 1.1045, sea water requires for its congelation a\r\ntemperature 18⅓ degrees lower than the ordinary freezing-point.[E]\r\n\r\n[E] Scoresby.\r\n\r\n339. But even when the water is saturated with salt, the\r\ncrystallising force studiously rejects the salt, and devotes itself\r\nto the congelation of the water alone. Hence the ice of sea water,\r\nwhen melted, produces fresh water. The only saline particles existing\r\nin such ice are those entangled 'mechanically in its pores. They have\r\nno part or lot in the structure of the crystal.\r\n\r\n340. This _exclusiveness_, if I may use the term, of the water\r\nmolecules; this entire rejection of all foreign elements from the\r\nedifices which they build, is enforced to a surprising degree.\r\nSulphuric acid has so strong an affinity for water that it is one\r\nof the most powerful agents known to the chemist for the removal of\r\nhumidity from air. Still, as shown by Faraday, when a mixture of\r\nsulphuric acid and water is frozen, the crystal formed is perfectly\r\nsweet and free from acidity. The water alone has lent itself to the\r\ncrystallising force.\r\n\r\n341. Every winter in the Arctic regions the sea freezes, roofing\r\nitself with ice of enormous thickness and vast extent. By the summer\r\nheat, and the tossing of the waves, this is broken up; the fragments\r\nare drifted by winds and borne by currents. They clash, they crush\r\neach other, they pile themselves into heaps, thus constituting the\r\nchief danger encountered by mariners in the polar seas.\r\n\r\n342. But among the drifting masses of flat sea-ice, vaster masses\r\nsail, which spring from a totally different source. These are the\r\n_Icebergs_ of the Arctic seas. They rise sometimes to an elevation of\r\nhundreds of feet above the water, while the weight of ice submerged\r\nis about seven times that seen above.\r\n\r\n343. The first observers of striking natural phenomena generally\r\nallow wonder and imagination more than their due place. But to\r\nexclude all error arising from this cause, I will refer to the\r\njournal of a cool and intrepid Arctic navigator, Sir Leopold\r\nMcClintock. He describes an iceberg 250 feet high, which was aground\r\nin 500 feet of water. This would make the entire height of the berg\r\n750 feet, not an unusual altitude for the greater icebergs.\r\n\r\n344. From Baffin's Bay these mighty masses come sailing down through\r\nDavis' Straits into the broad Atlantic. A vast amount of heat is\r\ndemanded for the simple liquefaction of ice (§ 48); and the melting\r\nof icebergs is on this account so slow, that when large they\r\nsometimes maintain themselves till they have been drifted 2000 miles\r\nfrom their place of birth.\r\n\r\n345. What is their origin? The Arctic glaciers. From the mountains\r\nin the interior the indurated snows slide into the valleys and fill\r\nthem with ice. The glaciers thus formed move like the Swiss ones,\r\nincessantly downward. But the Arctic glaciers reach the sea, enter\r\nit, often ploughing up its bottom into submarine moraines. Undermined\r\nby the lapping of the waves, and unable to resist the strain imposed\r\nby their own weight, they break across, and discharge vast masses\r\ninto the ocean. Some of these run aground on the adjacent shores,\r\nand often maintain themselves for years. Others escape southward, to\r\nbe finally dissolved in the warm waters of the Atlantic. The first\r\nengraving on the opposite page is copied from a photograph taken by\r\nMr. Bradford during a recent expedition to the Northern seas. The\r\nsecond represents a mass of ice upon the Glacier des Bossons. Their\r\nlikeness suggests their common origin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 50. _The Æggischhorn, the Märgelin See and its Icebergs._\r\n\r\n346. I am, however, unwilling that you should quit Switzerland\r\nwithout seeing such icebergs as it can show, and indeed there are\r\nother still nobler glaciers than the Mer de Glace with which you\r\nought to be acquainted. In tracing the Rhone to its source, you have\r\nalready ascended the valley of the Rhone. Let us visit it again\r\ntogether; halt at the little town of Viesch, and go from it straight\r\nup to the excellent hostelry on the slope of the Æggischhorn. This\r\nwe shall make our head-quarters while we explore that monarch of\r\nEuropean ice-streams,--the great Aletsch glacier.\r\n\r\n347. Including the longest of its branches, this noble ice-river is\r\nabout twenty miles long, while at the middle of its trunk it measures\r\nnearly a mile and a quarter from side to side. The grandest mountains\r\nof the Bernese Oberland, the Jungfrau, the Monch, the Trugberg, the\r\nAletschhorn, the Breithorn, the Gletscherhorn, and many another noble\r\npeak and ridge, are the collectors of its névés. From three great\r\nvalleys formed in the heart of the mountains these névés are poured,\r\nuniting together to form the trunk of the Aletsch at a place named\r\nby a witty mountaineer, the \"Place de la Concorde of Nature.\" If the\r\nphrase be meant to convey the ideas of tranquil grandeur, beauty of\r\nform, and purity of hue, it is well bestowed.\r\n\r\n348. Our hotel is not upon the peak of the Æggischhorn, but a brisk\r\nmorning walk soon places us upon the top. Thence we see the glacier\r\nlike a broad river stretching upwards to the roots of the Jungfrau,\r\nand downwards past the Bel Alp towards its end. Prolonging the vision\r\ndownwards, we strike the noblest mountain group in all the Alps,--the\r\nDom and its attendant peaks, the Matterhorn and the Weisshorn. The\r\nscene indeed is one of impressive grandeur, a multitude of peaks and\r\ncrests here unnamed contributing to its glory.\r\n\r\n349. But low down to our right, and surrounded by the sheltering\r\nmountains, is an object the beauty of which startles those who are\r\nunprepared for it. Yonder we see the naked side of the glacier,\r\nexposing glistening ice-cliffs sixty or seventy feet high. It would\r\nseem as if the Aletsch here were engaged in the vain attempt to\r\nthrust an arm through a lateral valley. It once did so; but the arm\r\nis now incessantly broken off close to the body of the glacier, a\r\ngreat space formerly covered by the ice being occupied by its water\r\nof liquefaction. A lake of the loveliest blue is thus formed, which\r\nreaches quite to the base of the ice-cliffs, saps them, as the Arctic\r\nwaves sap the Greenland glaciers, and receives from them the broken\r\nmasses which it has undermined. As we look down upon the lake, small\r\nicebergs sail over the tranquil surface, each resembling a snowy swan\r\naccompanied by its shadow.\r\n\r\n350. This is the beautiful little lake of Märgelin, or, as the Swiss\r\nhere call it, the Märgelin See. You see that splash, and immediately\r\nafterwards hear the sound of the plunging ice. The glacier has broken\r\nbefore our eyes, and dropped an iceberg into the lake. All over the\r\nlake the water is set in commotion, thus illustrating on a small\r\nscale the swamping waves produced by the descent of vast islands of\r\nice from the Arctic glaciers. Look to the end of the lake. It is\r\ncumbered with the remnants of icebergs now aground, which have been\r\nin part wafted thither by the wind, but in part slowly borne by the\r\nwater which moves gently in this direction.\r\n\r\n351. Imagine us below upon the margin of the lake, as I happened to\r\nbe on one occasion. There is one large and lonely iceberg about the\r\nmiddle. Suddenly a sound like that of a cataract is heard; we look\r\ntowards the iceberg and see water teeming from its sides. Whence\r\ncomes the water? the berg has become top-heavy through the melting\r\nunderneath; it is in the act of performing a somersault, and in\r\nrolling over carries with it a vast quantity of water, which rushes\r\nlike a waterfall down its sides. And notice that the iceberg, which\r\na moment ago was snowy-white, now exhibits the delicate blue colour\r\ncharacteristic of compact ice. It will soon, however, be rendered\r\nwhite again by the action of the sun. The vaster icebergs of the\r\nNorthern seas sometimes roll over in the same fashion. A week may be\r\nspent with delight and profit at the Æggischhorn.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 51. _The Bel Alp._\r\n\r\n352. From the Æggischhorn I might lead you along the mountain ridge\r\nby the Betten See, the fish of which we have already tasted, to the\r\nRieder Alp, and thence across the Aletsch to the Bel Alp. This is a\r\nfine mountain ramble, but you and I prefer making the glacier our\r\nhighway downwards. Easy at some places, it is by no means child's\r\nplay at others to unravel its crevasses. But the steady constancy and\r\nclose observation which we have hitherto found availing in difficult\r\nplaces do not forsake us here. We clear the fissures; and, after four\r\nhours of exhilarating work, we find ourselves upon the slope leading\r\nup to the Bel Alp hotel.\r\n\r\n353. This is one of the finest halting-places in the Alps. Stretching\r\nbefore us up to the Æggischhorn and Märgelin See is the long last\r\nreach of the Aletsch, with its great medial moraine running along its\r\nback. At hand is the wild gorge of the Massa, in which the snout of\r\nthe glacier lies couched like the head of a serpent. The beautiful\r\nsystem of the Oberaletsch glaciers is within easy reach. Above us\r\nis a peak called the Sparrenhorn, accessible to the most moderate\r\nclimber, and on the summit of which little more than an hour's\r\nexertion will place you and me. Below us now is the Oberaletsch\r\nglacier, exhibiting the most perfect of medial moraines. Near us\r\nis the great mass of the Aletschhorn, clasped by its névés, and\r\nculminating in brown rock. It is supported by other peaks almost as\r\nnoble as itself. The Nesthorn is at hand; while sweeping round to the\r\nwest we strike the glorious triad already referred to, the Weisshorn,\r\nthe Matterhorn, and the Dom. Take one glance at the crevasses of the\r\nglacier immediately below us. It tumbles at its end down a steep\r\nincline, and is greatly riven. But the crevasses open before the\r\nsteep part is reached, and you notice the coalescence of marginal and\r\ntransverse crevasses, producing a system of curved fissures with the\r\nconvexities of the curves pointing upwards. The mechanical reason of\r\nthis is now known to you. The glacier-tables are also numerous and\r\nfine. I should like to linger with you here for a week, exploring the\r\nexisting glaciers, and tracing out the evidences of others that have\r\npassed away.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 52. _The Riffelberg and Görner Glacier._\r\n\r\n354. And though our measurements and observations on the Mer de Glace\r\nare more or less representative of all that can be made or solved\r\nelsewhere, I am unwilling to leave you unacquainted with the great\r\nsystem of glaciers which stream from the northern slopes of Monte\r\nRosa and the adjacent mountains. From the Bel Alp we can descend to\r\nBrieg, and thence drive to Visp; but you and I prefer the breezy\r\nheights, so we sweep round the promontory of the Nessel, until we\r\nstand over the Rhone valley, in front of Visp. From this village an\r\nhour's walking carries us to Stalden, where the valley divides into\r\ntwo branches: the one leading through Saas over the Monte Moro, and\r\nthe other through St. Nicholas to Zermatt. The latter is our route.\r\n\r\n355. We reach Zermatt, but do not halt here. On the mountain ridge,\r\n4,000 feet above the valley, we discern the Riffelberg hotel. This\r\nwe reach. Right in front of us is the pinnacle of the Matterhorn,\r\nupon the top of which it must appear incredible to you that a human\r\nfoot could ever tread. Constancy and skill, however, accomplished\r\nthis, but in the first instance at a terrible price. In the little\r\nchurchyard of Zermatt we have seen the graves of two of the greatest\r\nmountaineers that Savoy and England have produced: and who, with two\r\ngallant young companions, fell from the Matterhorn in 1865.\r\n\r\n356. At the Riffelberg we are within an hour's walk of the famous\r\nGörner Grat, which commands so grand a view of the glaciers of Monte\r\nRosa. But yonder huge knob of perfectly bare rock, which is called\r\nthe Riffelhorn, must be our station. What the Cleft Station is to\r\nthe Mer de Glace, the Riffelhorn is to the Görner glacier and its\r\ntributaries. From its lower side the rock, easy as it may seem, is\r\ninaccessible. Here, indeed, in 1865, a fifth good man met his end,\r\nand he also lies beside his fellow countrymen in the churchyard of\r\nZermatt. Passing a little tarn, or lake, called the Riffel See, we\r\nassail the Riffelhorn on its upper side. It is capital rock-practice\r\nto reach the summit; and from it we command a most extraordinary\r\nscene.\r\n\r\n357. The huge and many-peaked mass of Monte Rosa faces us, and we\r\nscan its snows from bottom to top. To the right is the mighty ridge\r\nof the Lyskamm, also laden with snow; and between both lies the\r\nWestern Glacier of Monte Rosa. This glacier meets another from the\r\nvast snow-fields of the Cima di Jazzi; they join to form the Görner\r\nglacier, and from their place of junction stretches the customary\r\nmedial moraine. On this side of the Lyskamm rise two beautifully\r\nsnowy eminences, the Twins Castor and Pollux; then come the brown\r\ncrags of the Breithorn, then the Little Matterhorn, and then the\r\nbroad snow-field of the Théodule, out of which springs the Great\r\nMatterhorn, and which you and I will cross subsequently into Italy.\r\n\r\n358. The valleys and depressions between these mountains are filled\r\nwith glaciers. Down the flanks of the Twin Castor comes the Glacier\r\ndes Jumeaux, from Pollux comes the Schwartze glacier, from the\r\nBreithorn the Trifti glacier, then come the Little Matterhorn glacier\r\nand the Théodule glacier, each, as it welds itself to the trunk,\r\ncarrying with it its medial moraine. We can count nine such moraines\r\nfrom our present position. And to a still more surprising degree\r\nthan on the Mer de Glace, we notice the power of the ice to yield to\r\npressure; the broad névés being squeezed on the trunk of the Görner\r\ninto white stripes, which become ever narrower between the bounding\r\nmoraines, and finally disappear under their own shingle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GÖRNER GLACIER, WITH MONTE ROSA IN THE DISTANCE,\r\nAND THE RIFFELHORN TO THE LEFT.]\r\n\r\n359. On the two main tributaries we also notice moraines which seem\r\nin each case to rise from the body of the glacier, appearing in the\r\nmiddle of the ice without any apparent origin higher up. These at\r\ntheir sources, are sub-glacial moraines, which have been rubbed away\r\nfrom rocky promontories entirely covered with ice. They lie hidden\r\nfor a time in the body of the glacier, and appear at the surface\r\nwhere the ice above them has been melted away by the sun.\r\n\r\n360. This is the place to mention a notion long entertained by the\r\ninhabitants of the high Alps, that glaciers possess the power of\r\nthrusting out all impurities from them. On the Mer de Glace you and\r\nI have noticed large patches of clay and black mud which evidently\r\ncame from the body of the glacier, and we can therefore understand\r\nhow natural was this notion of extrusion to people unaccustomed to\r\nclose observation. But the power of the glacier in this respect is\r\nin reality the power of the sun, which fuses the ice above concealed\r\nimpurities, and, like the bodies of the guides on the Glacier des\r\nBossons (143), brings them to the light of day.\r\n\r\n361. On no other glacier will you find more objects of interest than\r\non the Görner. Sand-cones, glacier-tables, deep ice-gorges cut by\r\nstreams and bridged fantastically by boulders, moulins, sometimes\r\narched ice-caverns of extraordinary size and beauty. On the lower\r\npart of the glacier we notice the partial disappearance of the medial\r\nmoraine in the crevasses, and its reappearance at the foot of the\r\nincline. For many years this glacier was steadily advancing on the\r\nmeadow in front of it, ploughing up the soil and overturning the\r\nchalets in its way. It now shares in the general retreat exhibited\r\nduring the last fifteen years among the glaciers of the Alps. As\r\nusual, a river, the Visp, rushes from a vault at the extremity of the\r\nGörner glacier.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 53. _Ancient Glaciers of Switzerland._\r\n\r\n362. You have not lost the memory of the old Moraine, which\r\ninterested us so much in our first ascent from the source of the\r\nArveiron; for it opened our minds to the fact that at one period of\r\nits history the Mer de Glace attained far greater dimensions than it\r\nnow exhibits. Our experience since that time has enabled us to pursue\r\nthese evidences of ice action to an extent of which we had then no\r\nnotion.\r\n\r\n363. Close to the existing glacier, for example, we have repeatedly\r\nseen the mountain side laid bare by the retreat of the ice. This is\r\nespecially conspicuous just now, because for the last fifteen or\r\nsixteen years the glaciers of the Alps have been steadily shrinking;\r\nso that it is no uncommon thing to see the marginal rocks laid bare\r\nfor a height of fifty, sixty, eighty, or even one hundred feet above\r\nthe present glacier. On the rocks thus exposed we see the evident\r\nmarks of the sliding; and our eyes and minds have been so educated in\r\nthe observation of these appearances that we are now able to detect,\r\nwith certainty, icemarks, or moraines, ancient or modern, wherever\r\nthey appear.\r\n\r\n364. But the elevations at which we have found such evidence might\r\nwell shake belief in the conclusions to which they point. Beside\r\nthe Massa Gorge, at 1,000 feet above the present Aletsch, we found\r\na great old moraine. Descending the meadows between the Bel Alp\r\nand Flatten, we found another, now clothed with grass, and bearing\r\na village on its back. But I wish to carry you to a region which\r\nexhibits these evidences on a still grander and more impressive\r\nscale. We have already taken a brief flight to the valley of\r\nHasli and the Glacier of the Aar. Let us make that glacier our\r\nstarting-point. Walking from it downwards towards the Grimsel, we\r\npass everywhere over rocks singularly rounded, and fluted, and\r\nscarred. These appearances are manifestly the work of the glacier in\r\nrecent times. But we approach the Grimsel, and at the turning of the\r\nvalley stand before the precipitous granite flank of the mountain.\r\nThe traces of the ancient ice are here as plain as they are amazing.\r\nThe rocks are so hard that not only the fluting and polishing, but\r\neven the fine scratches which date back unnamable thousands of years\r\nare as evident as if they had been made yesterday. We may trace these\r\nevidences to a height of two thousand feet above the present valley\r\nbed. It is indubitable that an ice-river of this astounding depth\r\nonce flowed through the vale of Hasli.\r\n\r\n365. Yonder is the summit of the Siedelhorn; and if we gain it, the\r\nUnteraar glacier will lie like a map below us. From this commanding\r\npoint we plainly see marked upon the mountain sides the height to\r\nwhich the ancient ice extended. The ice-ground part of the mountains\r\nis clearly distinguished from the splintered crests which in those\r\ndistant days rose above the surface of the glacier, and which must\r\nhave then appeared as island peaks and crests in the midst of an\r\nocean of ice.\r\n\r\n366. We now scamper down the Siedelhorn, get once more into the\r\nvalley of Hasli, along which we follow for more than twenty miles\r\nthe traces of the ice. Fluted precipices, polished slabs, and\r\nbeautifully-rounded granite domes. Right and left upon the mountain\r\nflanks, at great elevations, the evidences appear. We follow the\r\nfootsteps of the glacier to the Lake of Brientz; and if we prolonged\r\nour enquiries, we should learn that all the lake beds of this region,\r\nat the time now referred to, bore the burden of immense masses of ice.\r\n\r\n367. Instead of the vale of Hasli, we might take the valley of the\r\nRhone. The traces of a mighty glacier, which formerly filled it,\r\nmay be followed all the way to Martigny, which is 60 miles distant\r\nfrom the present ice. At Martigny the Rhone glacier was reinforced\r\nby another from Mont Blanc, and the welded masses moved onward,\r\nplaning the mountains right and left, to the Lake of Geneva, the\r\nbasin of which they entirely filled. Other evidences prove that the\r\nglacier did not end here, but pushed across the low country until it\r\nencountered the limestone barrier of the Jura Mountains.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 54. _Erratic Blocks._\r\n\r\n368. What are these other evidences? We have seen mighty rocks poised\r\non the moraines of the Mer de Glace, and we now know that, unless\r\nthey are split and shattered by the frost, these rocks will, at\r\nsome distant day, be landed bodily by the Glacier des Bois in the\r\nvalley of Chamouni. You have already learned that these boulders\r\noften reveal the mineralogical nature of the mountains among which\r\nthe glacier has passed; that specimens are thus brought down of a\r\ncharacter totally different from the rocks among which they are\r\nfinally landed; this is strikingly the case with the _erratic blocks_\r\nstranded along the Jura.\r\n\r\n369. For the Jura itself, as already stated, is limestone; there is\r\nno trace of native granite to be found amongst these hills. Still\r\nalong the breast of the mountain above the town of Neufchâtel, and at\r\nabout 800 feet above the lake of Neufchâtel, we find stranded a belt\r\nof granite boulders from Mont Blanc. And when we clear the soil away\r\nfrom the adjacent mountain side, we find upon the limestone rocks the\r\nscarrings of the ancient glacier which brought the boulders here.\r\n\r\n370. The most famous of these rocks, called the Pierre à Bôt,\r\nmeasures 50 feet in length, 40 in height, and 20 in width.\r\nMultiplying these three numbers together, we obtain 40,000 cubic feet\r\nas the volume of the boulder.\r\n\r\n371. But this is small compared with some of the rocks which\r\nconstitute the freight of even recent glaciers. Let us visit another\r\nof them. We have already been to Stalden, where the valley divides\r\ninto two branches, the right branch running to St. Nicholas and\r\nZermatt, and the left one to Saas and the Monte Moro. Three hours\r\nabove Saas we come upon the end of the Allelein glacier, not filling\r\nthe main valley, but thrown athwart it so as to stop its drainage\r\nlike a dam. Above this ice-dam we have the Mattmark Lake, and at the\r\nhead of the lake a small inn well known to travellers over the Monte\r\nMoro.\r\n\r\n372. Close to this inn is the greatest boulder that we have ever\r\nseen. It measures 240,000 cubic feet. Looking across the valley we\r\nnotice a glacier with its present end half a mile from the boulder.\r\nThe stone, I believe, is serpentine, and were you and I to explore\r\nthe Schwartzberg glacier to its upper fastnesses, we should find\r\namong them the birthplace of this gigantic stone. Four-and-twenty\r\nyears ago, when the glacier reached the place now occupied by the\r\nboulder, it landed there its mighty freight, and then retreated.\r\nThere is a second ice-borne rock at hand which would be considered\r\nvast were it not dwarfed by the aspect of its huger neighbour.\r\n\r\n373. Evidence of this kind might be multiplied to any extent. In\r\nfact, at this moment, distinguished men, like Professor Favre of\r\nGeneva, are determining from the distribution of the erratic blocks\r\nthe extent of the ancient glaciers of Switzerland. It was, however,\r\nan engineer named Venetz that first brought these evidences to light,\r\nand announced to an incredulous world the vast extension of the\r\nancient ice. M. Agassiz afterwards developed and wonderfully expanded\r\nthe discovery. Perhaps the most interesting observation regarding\r\nancient glaciers is that of Dr. Hooker, who, during a recent visit\r\nto Palestine, found the celebrated Cedars of Lebanon growing upon\r\nancient moraines.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 55. _Ancient Glaciers of England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales._\r\n\r\n374. At the time the ice attained this extraordinary development in\r\nthe Alps, many other portions of Europe, where no glaciers now exist,\r\nwere covered with them. In the Highlands of Scotland, among the\r\nmountains of England, Ireland, and Wales, the ancient glaciers have\r\nwritten their story as plainly as in the Alps themselves. I should\r\nlike to wander with you through Borrodale in Cumberland, or through\r\nthe valleys near Bethgellert in Wales. Under all the beauty of the\r\npresent scenery we should discover the memorials of a time when the\r\nwhole region was locked in the embrace of ice. Professor Ramsay is\r\nespecially distinguished by his writings on the ancient glaciers of\r\nWales.\r\n\r\n375. We have made the acquaintance of the Reeks of Magillicuddy as\r\nthe great condensers of Atlantic vapour. At the time now referred to,\r\nthis moisture did not fall as soft and fructifying rain, but as snow,\r\nwhich formed the nutriment of great glaciers. A chain of lakes now\r\nconstitutes the chief attraction of Killarney, the Lower, the Middle,\r\nand the Upper Lake. Let us suppose ourselves rowing towards the head\r\nof the Upper Lake with the Purple Mountain to our left. Remembering\r\nour travels in the Alps, you would infallibly call my attention to\r\nthe planing of the rocks, and declare the action to be unmistakably\r\nthat of glaciers. With our attention thus sharpened, we land at\r\nthe head of the lake, and walk up the Black Valley to the base of\r\nMagillicuddy's Reeks. Your conclusion would be, that this valley\r\ntells a tale as wonderful as that of Hasli.\r\n\r\n376. We reach our boat and row homewards along the Upper Lake. Its\r\nislands now possess a new interest for us. Some of them are bare,\r\nothers are covered wholly or in part with luxuriant vegetation; but\r\nboth the naked and clothed islands are glaciated. The weathering of\r\nages has not altered their forms: there are the Cannon Rock, the\r\nGiant's Coffin, the Man of War, all sculptured as if the chisel had\r\npassed over them in our own lifetime. These lakes, now fringed with\r\ntender woodland beauty, were all occupied by the ancient ice. It has\r\ndisappeared, and seeds from other regions have been wafted thither\r\nto sow the trees, the shrubs, the ferns, and the grasses which now\r\nbeautify Killarney. Man himself, they say, has made his appearance in\r\nthe world since that time of ice; but of the real period and manner\r\nof man's introduction little is professed to be known since, to make\r\nthem square with science, new meanings have been found for the\r\nbeautiful myths and stories of the Bible.\r\n\r\n377. It is the nature and tendency of the human mind to look backward\r\nand forward; to endeavour to restore the past and predict the future.\r\nThus endowed, from data patiently and painfully won, we recover in\r\nidea a state of things which existed thousands, it may be millions,\r\nof years before the history of the human race began.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 56. _The Glacial Epoch._\r\n\r\n378. This period of ice-extension has been named the _Glacial Epoch_.\r\nIn accounting for it great minds have fallen into grave errors, as we\r\nshall presently see.\r\n\r\n379. The substance on which we have thus far been working exists in\r\nthree different states: as a solid in ice; as a liquid in water; as\r\na gas in vapour. To cause it to pass from one of these states to the\r\nnext following one, _heat_ is necessary.\r\n\r\n380. Dig a hole in the ice of the Mer de Glace in summer, and place\r\na thermometer in the hole; it will stand at 32° Fahr. Dip your\r\nthermometer into one of the glacier streams; it will still mark 32°.\r\n_The water is therefore as cold as ice._\r\n\r\n381. Hence the whole of the heat poured by the sun upon the glacier,\r\nand which has been absorbed by the glacier, is expended in simply\r\nliquefying the ice, and not in rendering either ice or water a single\r\ndegree warmer.\r\n\r\n382. Expose water to a fire; it becomes hotter for a time. It boils,\r\nand from that moment it ceases to get hotter. After it has begun to\r\nboil, all the heat communicated by the fire is carried away by the\r\nsteam, _though the steam itself is not the least fraction of a degree\r\nhotter than the water_.\r\n\r\n383. In fact, simply to liquefy ice a large quantity of heat\r\nis necessary, and to vaporize water a still larger quantity is\r\nnecessary. And inasmuch as this heat does not render the water warmer\r\nthan the ice, nor the steam warmer than the water, it was at one time\r\nsupposed to be _hidden_ in the water and in the steam. And it was\r\ntherefore called _latent_ heat.\r\n\r\n384. Let us ask how much heat must the sun expend in order to convert\r\na pound weight of the tropical ocean into vapour? This problem has\r\nbeen accurately solved by experiment. It would require in round\r\nnumbers 1,000 times the amount of heat necessary to raise one pound\r\nof water one degree in temperature.\r\n\r\n385. But the quantity of heat which would raise the temperature of a\r\npound of water one degree would raise the temperature of a pound of\r\niron _ten_ degrees. This has been also proved by experiment. Hence\r\nto convert one pound of the tropical ocean into vapour the sun must\r\nexpend 10,000 times as much heat as would raise one pound of iron one\r\ndegree in temperature.\r\n\r\n386. This quantity of heat would raise the temperature of 5 lbs. of\r\niron 2,000 degrees, which is the fusing point of cast iron; at this\r\ntemperature the metal would not only be _white hot_, but would be\r\npassing into the molten condition.\r\n\r\n387. Consider the conclusions at which we have now arrived. For every\r\npound of tropical vapour, or for every pound of Alpine ice produced\r\nby the congelation of that vapour, an amount of heat has been\r\nexpended by the sun sufficient to raise 5 lbs. of cast iron to its\r\nmelting-point.\r\n\r\n388. It would not be difficult to calculate approximately the weight\r\nof the Mer de Glace and its tributaries--to say, for example, that\r\nthey contained so many millions of millions of tons of ice and snow.\r\nLet the place of the ice be taken by a mass of white-hot iron of\r\nquintuple the weight; with such a picture before your mind you get\r\nsome notion of the enormous amount of heat paid out by the sun to\r\nproduce the present glacier.\r\n\r\n389. You must think over this, until it is as clear as sunshine.\r\nFor you must never henceforth fall into the error already referred\r\nto, and which has entangled so many. So natural was the association\r\nof ice and cold, that even celebrated men assumed that all that is\r\nneeded to produce a great extension of our glaciers is a diminution\r\nof the sun's temperature. Had they gone through the foregoing\r\nreflections and calculations, they would probably have demanded more\r\nheat instead of less for the production of a \"glacial epoch.\" What\r\nthey really needed were _condensers_ sufficiently powerful to congeal\r\nthe vapour generated by the heat of the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 57. _Glacier Theories._\r\n\r\n390. You have not forgotten, and hardly ever can forget, our climbs\r\nto the Cleft Station. Thoughts were then suggested which we have not\r\nyet discussed. We saw the branch glaciers coming down from their\r\nnévés, welding themselves together, pushing through Trélaporte, and\r\nafterwards moving through the sinuous valley of the Mer de Glace.\r\nThese appearances alone, without taking into account subsequent\r\nobservations, were sufficient to suggest the idea that glacier\r\nice, however hard and brittle it may appear, is really a viscous\r\nsubstance, resembling treacle, or honey, or tar, or lava.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 58. _Dilatation and Sliding Theories._\r\n\r\n391. Still this was not the notion expressed by the majority of\r\nwriters upon glaciers. Scheuchzer of Zürich, a great naturalist,\r\nvisited the glaciers in 1705, and propounded a theory of their\r\nmotion. Water, he knew, expands in freezing, and the force of\r\nexpansion is so great, that thick bombshells filled with water, and\r\npermitted to freeze, are, as we know (312), shattered to pieces by\r\nthe ice within. Scheuchzer supposed that the water in the fissures of\r\nthe glaciers, freezing there and expanding with resistless force, was\r\nthe power which urged the glacier downwards. He added to this theory\r\nother notions of a less scientific kind.\r\n\r\n392. Many years subsequently, De Charpentier of Bex renewed and\r\ndeveloped this theory with such ability and completeness, that it was\r\nlong known as Charpentier's Theory of Dilatation. M. Agassiz for a\r\ntime espoused this theory, and it was also more or less distinctly\r\nheld by other writers. The glacier, in fact, was considered to be a\r\nmagazine of cold, capable of freezing all water percolating through\r\nit. The theory was abandoned when this notion of glacier cold was\r\nproved by M. Agassiz to be untenable.\r\n\r\n393. In 1760, Altmann and Grüner propounded the view that glaciers\r\nmoved by sliding over their beds. Nearly forty years subsequently,\r\nthis notion was revived by De Saussure, and it has therefore been\r\ncalled \"De Saussure's Theory,\" or the \"Sliding Theory\" of glacier\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\n394. There was, however, but little reason to connect the name of\r\nDe Saussure with this or any other theory of glaciers. Incessantly\r\noccupied in observations of another kind, this celebrated man devoted\r\nvery little time or thought to the question of glacier motion. What\r\nhe has written upon the subject reads less like the elaboration of a\r\ntheory than the expression of an opinion.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 59. _Plastic Theory._\r\n\r\n395. By none of these writers is the property of viscosity or\r\nplasticity ascribed to glacier ice; the appearances of many glaciers\r\nare, however, so suggestive of this idea that we may be sure it\r\nwould have found more frequent expression, were it not in such\r\napparent contradiction with our every-day experience of ice.\r\n\r\n396. Still the idea found its advocates. In a little book, published\r\nin 1773, and entitled \"Picturesque Journey to the Glaciers of Savoy,\"\r\nBordier of Geneva wrote thus:--\"It is now time to look at all these\r\nobjects with the eyes of reason; to study, in the first place, the\r\nposition and the progression of glaciers, and to seek the solution of\r\ntheir principal phenomena. At the first aspect of the ice-mountains\r\nan observation presents itself, which appears sufficient to explain\r\nall. It is that the entire mass of ice is connected together, and\r\npresses from above downwards after the manner of fluids. Let us then\r\nregard the ice, not as a mass entirely rigid and immobile, but as a\r\nheap of coagulated matter, or as softened wax, flexible and ductile\r\nto a certain point.\"[F] Here probably for the first time the quality\r\nof plasticity is ascribed to the ice of glaciers.\r\n\r\n[F] I am indebted to my distinguished friend Prof. Studer of Berne\r\nfor directing my attention to Bordier's book, and to my friends at\r\nthe British Museum for the great trouble they have taken to find it\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\n397. To us, familiar with the aspect of the glaciers, it must seem\r\nstrange that this idea once expressed did not at once receive\r\nrecognition and development. But in those early days explorers were\r\nfew, and the \"Picturesque Journey\" probably but little known, so\r\nthat the notion of plasticity lay dormant for more than half a\r\ncentury. But Bordier was at length succeeded by a man of far greater\r\nscientific grasp and insight than himself. This was Rendu, a Catholic\r\npriest and canon when he wrote, and afterwards Bishop of Annecy. In\r\n1841 Rendu laid before the Royal Academy of Sciences of Savoy his\r\n\"Theory of the Glaciers of Savoy,\" a contribution for ever memorable\r\nin relation to this subject.[G]\r\n\r\n[G] \"Memoirs of the Academy,\" vol. x.\r\n\r\n398. Rendu seized the idea of glacier plasticity with great power and\r\nclearness, and followed it resolutely to its consequences. It is not\r\nknown that he had ever seen the work of Bordier; probably not, as he\r\nnever mentions it. Let me quote for you some of Rendu's expressions,\r\nwhich, however, fail to give an adequate idea of his insight and\r\nprecision of thought:--\"Between the Mer de Glace and a river there\r\nis a resemblance so complete that it is impossible to find in the\r\nglacier a circumstance which does not exist in the river. In currents\r\nof water the motion is not uniform either throughout their width or\r\nthroughout their depth. The friction of the bottom and of the sides,\r\nwith the action of local hindrances, causes the motion to vary, and\r\nonly towards the middle of the surface do we obtain the full motion.\"\r\n\r\n399. This reads like a prediction of what has since been established\r\nby measurement. Looking at the glacier of Mont Dolent, which\r\nresembles a sheaf in form, wide at both ends and narrow in the\r\nmiddle, and reflecting that the upper wide part had become narrow,\r\nand the narrow middle part again wide, Rendu observes, \"There is a\r\nmultitude of facts which seem to necessitate the belief that glacier\r\nice enjoys a kind of ductility which enables it to mould itself to\r\nits locality, to thin out, to swell, and to contract as if it were a\r\nsoft paste.\"\r\n\r\n400. To fully test his conclusions, Rendu required the accurate\r\nmeasurement of glacier motion. Had he added to his other endowments\r\nthe practical skill of a land-surveyor, he would now be regarded as\r\nthe prince of glacialists. As it was he was obliged to be content\r\nwith imperfect measurements. In one of his excursions he examined the\r\nguides regarding the successive positions of a vast rock which he\r\nfound upon the ice close to the side of the glacier. The mean of five\r\nyears gave him a motion for this block of 40 feet a year.\r\n\r\n401. Another block, the transport of which he subsequently measured\r\nmore accurately, gave him a velocity of 400 feet a year. Note his\r\nexplanation of this discrepancy:--\"The enormous difference of these\r\ntwo observations arises from the fact that one block stood near the\r\ncentre of the glacier, which moves most rapidly, while the other\r\nstood near the side, where the ice is held back by friction.\" So\r\nclear and definite were Rendu's ideas of the plastic motion of\r\nglaciers, that had the question of curvature occurred to him, I\r\nentertain no doubt that he would have enunciated beforehand the\r\nshifting of the point of maximum motion from side to side across the\r\naxis of the glacier (§ 25).\r\n\r\n402. It is right that you should know that scientific men do not\r\nalways agree in their estimates of the comparative value of facts\r\nand ideas; and it is especially right that you should know that your\r\npresent tutor attaches a very high value to ideas when they spring\r\nfrom the profound and persistent pondering of superior minds, and\r\nare not, as is too often the case, thrown out without the warrant\r\nof either deep thought or natural capacity. It is because I believe\r\nRendu's labours fulfil this condition, that I ascribe to them so\r\nhigh a value. But when you become older and better informed, you may\r\ndiffer from me; and I write these words lest you should too readily\r\naccept my opinion of Rendu. Judge me, if you care to do so, when your\r\nknowledge is matured. I certainly shall not fear your verdict.\r\n\r\n403. But, much as I prize the prompting idea, and thoroughly as\r\nI believe that often in it the force of genius mainly lies, it\r\nwould, in my opinion, be an error of omission of the gravest kind,\r\nand which, if habitual, would ensure the ultimate decay of natural\r\nknowledge, to neglect verifying our ideas, and giving them outward\r\nreality and substance when the means of doing so are at hand. In\r\nscience thought, as far as possible, ought to be wedded to fact.\r\nThis was attempted by Rendu, and in part accomplished by Agassiz and\r\nForbes.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 60. _Viscous Theory._\r\n\r\n404. Here indeed the merits of the distinguished glacialist last\r\nnamed rise conspicuously to view. From the able and earnest advocacy\r\nof Professor Forbes, the public knowledge of this doctrine of glacial\r\nplasticity is almost wholly derived. He gave the doctrine a more\r\ndistinctive form; he first applied the term viscous to glacier ice,\r\nand sought to found upon precise measurements a \"Viscous Theory\" of\r\nglacier motion.\r\n\r\n405. I am here obliged to state facts in their historic sequence.\r\nProfessor Forbes when he began his investigations was acquainted with\r\nthe labours of Rendu. In his earliest work upon the Alps he refers\r\nto those labours in terms of flattering recognition. But though as\r\na matter of fact Rendu's ideas were there to prompt him, it would\r\nbe too much to say that he needed their inspiration. Had Rendu\r\nnot preceded him, he might none the less have grasped the idea of\r\nviscosity, executing his measurements and applying his knowledge to\r\nmaintain it. Be that as it may, the appearance of Professor Forbes on\r\nthe Unteraar glacier in 1841, and on the Mer de Glace in 1842, and\r\nhis labours then and subsequently, have given him a name not to be\r\nforgotten in the scientific history of glaciers.\r\n\r\n406. The theory advocated by Professor Forbes was enunciated by\r\nhimself in these words:--\"A glacier is an imperfect fluid, or viscous\r\nbody, which is urged down slopes of certain inclination by the\r\nnatural pressure of its parts.\" In 1773 Bordier wrote thus:--\"As the\r\nglaciers always advance upon the plain, and never disappear, it is\r\nabsolutely essential that new ice shall perpetually take the place\r\nof that which is melted: it must therefore be pressed forward from\r\nabove. One can hardly refuse then to accept the astonishing truth,\r\nthat this vast extent of hard and solid ice moves as a single piece\r\ndownwards.\" In the passage already quoted he speaks of the ice being\r\npressed as a fluid from above. These constitute, I believe, Bordier's\r\ncontributions to this subject. The quotations show his sagacity at an\r\nearly date; but, in point of completeness, his views are not to be\r\ncompared with those of Rendu and Forbes.\r\n\r\n407. I must not omit to state here that though the idea of viscosity\r\nhas not been espoused by M. Agassiz, his measurements, and maps of\r\nmeasurements, on the Unteraar glacier have been recently cited as the\r\nmost clear and conclusive illustrations of a quality which, at all\r\nevents, closely resembles viscosity.\r\n\r\n408. But why, with proofs before him more copious and characteristic\r\nthan those of any other observer, does M. Agassiz hesitate to accept\r\nthe idea of viscosity as applied to ice? Doubtless because he\r\nbelieves the notion to be contradicted by our every-day experience of\r\nthe substance.\r\n\r\n409. Take a mass of ice ten or even fifteen cubic feet in volume;\r\ndraw a saw across it to a depth of half an inch or an inch; and\r\nstrike a pointed pricker, not thicker than a very small round file,\r\ninto the groove; the substance will split from top to bottom with a\r\nclean crystalline fracture. How is this brittleness to be reconciled\r\nwith the notion of viscosity?\r\n\r\n410. We have, moreover, been upon the glacier and have witnessed the\r\nbirth of crevasses. We have seen them beginning as narrow cracks\r\nsuddenly formed, days being required to open them a single inch. In\r\nmany glaciers fissures may be traced narrow and profound for hundreds\r\nof yards through the ice. What does this prove? Did the ice possess\r\neven a very small modicum of that power of stretching, which is\r\ncharacteristic of a viscous substance, such crevasses could not be\r\nformed.\r\n\r\n411. Still it is undoubted that the glacier moves like a viscous\r\nbody. The centre flows past the sides, the top flows over the\r\nbottom, and the motion through a curved valley corresponds to fluid\r\nmotion. Mr. Mathews, Mr. Froude, and above all Signor Bianconi,\r\nhave, moreover, recently made experiments on ice which strikingly\r\nillustrate the flexibility of the substance. These experiments merit,\r\nand will doubtless receive, full attention at a future time.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 61. _Regelation Theory._\r\n\r\n412. I will now describe to you an attempt that has been made of\r\nlate years to reconcile the brittleness of ice with, its motion in\r\nglaciers. It is founded on the observation, made by Mr. Faraday in\r\n1850, that when two pieces of thawing ice are placed together they\r\nfreeze together at the place of contact.\r\n\r\n413. This fact may not surprise you; still it surprised Mr. Faraday\r\nand others, and men of very great distinction in science have\r\ndiffered in their interpretation of the fact. The difficulty is to\r\nexplain where, or how, in ice already thawing the cold is to be\r\nfound requisite to freeze the film of water between the two touching\r\nsurfaces.\r\n\r\n414. The word _Regelation_ was proposed by Dr. Hooker to express the\r\nfreezing together of two pieces of thawing ice observed by Faraday;\r\nand the memoir in which the term was first used was published by Mr.\r\nHuxley and Mr. Tyndall in the Philosophical Transactions for 1857.\r\n\r\n415. The _fact_ of regelation, and its application irrespective of\r\nthe _cause_ of regelation, may be thus illustrated:--Saw two slabs\r\nfrom a block of ice, and bring their flat surfaces into contact; they\r\nimmediately freeze together. Two plates of ice, laid one upon the\r\nother, with flannel round them overnight, are sometimes so firmly\r\nfrozen in the morning that they will rather break elsewhere than\r\nalong their surface of junction. If you enter one of the dripping\r\nice-caves of Switzerland, you have only to press for a moment a slab\r\nof ice against the roof of the cave to cause it to freeze there and\r\nstick to the roof.\r\n\r\n416. Place a number of fragments of ice in a basin of water, and\r\ncause them to touch each other; they freeze together where they\r\ntouch. You can form a chain of such fragments; and then, by taking\r\nhold of one end of the chain, you can draw the whole series after it.\r\nChains of icebergs are sometimes formed in this way in the Arctic\r\nseas.\r\n\r\n417. Consider what follows from these observations. Snow consists of\r\nsmall particles of ice. Now if by pressure we squeeze out the air\r\nentangled in thawing snow, and bring the little ice-granules into\r\nclose contact, they may be expected to freeze together; and if the\r\nexpulsion of the air be complete, the squeezed snow may be expected\r\nto assume the appearance of compact ice.\r\n\r\n418. We arrive at this conclusion by reasoning; let us now test it by\r\nexperiment, employing a suitable hydraulic press, and a mould to hold\r\nthe snow. In exact accordance with our expectation, we convert by\r\npressure the snow into ice.[H]\r\n\r\n[H] A similar experiment was made by the Messrs. Schlagintweit prior\r\nto the discovery which explains it, and which therefore remained\r\nunsolved.\r\n\r\n419. Place a compact mass of ice in a proper mould, and subject\r\nit to pressure. It breaks in pieces: squeeze the pieces forcibly\r\ntogether; they re-unite by regelation, and a compact piece of ice,\r\ntotally different in shape from the first one, is taken from the\r\npress. To produce this effect the ice must be in a thawing condition.\r\nWhen its temperature is much below the melting point it is crushed\r\nby pressure, not into a pellucid mass of another shape, but into a\r\nwhite powder.\r\n\r\n420. By means of suitable moulds you may in this way change the shape\r\nof ice to any extent, turning out spheres, and cups, and rings, and\r\ntwisted ropes of the substance; the change of form in these cases\r\nbeing effected through rude fracture and regelation.\r\n\r\n421. By applying the pressure carefully, rude fracture may be\r\navoided, and the ice compelled slowly to change its form as if it\r\nwere a plastic body.\r\n\r\n422. Now our first experiment illustrates the consolidation of the\r\nsnows of the higher Alpine regions. The deeper layers of the névé\r\nhave to bear the weight of all above them, and are thereby converted\r\ninto more or less perfect ice. And our last experiment illustrates\r\nthe changes of form observed upon the glacier, where, by the slow and\r\nconstant application of pressure, the ice gradually moulds itself to\r\nthe valley, which it fills.\r\n\r\n423. In glaciers, however, we have also ample illustrations of\r\nrude fracture and regelation. The opening and closing of crevasses\r\nillustrate this. The glacier is broken on the cascades and mended\r\nat their bases. When two branch glaciers lay their sides together,\r\nthe regelation is so firm that they begin immediately to flow in\r\nthe trunk glacier as a single stream. The medial moraine gives no\r\nindication by its slowness of motion that it is derived from the\r\nsluggish ice of the sides of the branch glaciers.\r\n\r\n424. The gist of the Regelation Theory is that the ice of glaciers\r\nchanges its form and preserves its continuity under _pressure_ which\r\nkeeps its particles together. But when subjected to _tension_, sooner\r\nthan stretch it _breaks_, and behaves no longer as a viscous body.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 62. _Cause of Regelation._\r\n\r\n425. Here the fact of regelation is applied to explain the plasticity\r\nof glacier ice, no attempt being made to assign the cause of\r\nregelation itself. They are two entirely distinct questions. But a\r\nlittle time will be well spent in looking more closely into the cause\r\nof regelation. You may feel some surprise that eminent men should\r\ndevote their attention to so small a point, but we must not forget\r\nthat in nature nothing is small. Laws and principles interest the\r\nscientific student most, and these may be as well illustrated by\r\nsmall things as by large ones.\r\n\r\n426. The question of regelation immediately connects itself with that\r\nof \"latent heat,\" already referred to (383), but which we must now\r\nsubject to further examination. To melt ice, as already stated, a\r\nlarge amount of heat is necessary, and in the case of the glaciers\r\nthis heat is furnished by the sun. Neither the ice so melted nor\r\nthe water which results from its liquefaction can fall below 32°\r\nFahrenheit. The freezing point of water and the melting point of ice\r\ntouch each other, as it were, at this temperature. A hair's-breadth\r\nlower water freezes; a hair's-breadth higher ice melts.\r\n\r\n427. But if the ice could be caused to melt without this supply of\r\nsolar heat, a temperature lower than that of ordinary thawing ice\r\nwould result. When snow and salt, or pounded ice and salt, are mixed\r\ntogether, the salt causes the ice to melt, and in this way a cold of\r\n20 or 30 degrees below the freezing point may be produced. Here, in\r\nfact, the ice consumes _its own warmth_ in the work of liquefaction.\r\nSuch a mixture of ice and salt is called \"a freezing mixture.\"\r\n\r\n428. And if by any other means ice at the temperature of 32°\r\nFahrenheit could be liquefied without access of heat from without,\r\nthe water produced would be colder than the ice. Now Professor James\r\nThomson has proved that ice may be liquefied by mere _pressure_, and\r\nhis brother, Sir William Thomson, has also shown that water under\r\npressure requires a lower temperature to freeze it than when the\r\npressure is removed. Professor Mousson subsequently liquefied large\r\nmasses of ice by a hydraulic press; and by a beautiful experiment\r\nProfessor Helmholtz has proved that water in a vessel from which\r\nthe air has been removed, and which is therefore relieved from the\r\npressure of the atmosphere, freezes and forms ice-crystals when\r\nsurrounded by melting ice. All these facts are summed up in the\r\nbrief statement _that the freezing point of water is lowered by\r\npressure_.[I]\r\n\r\n[I] Professor James Thomson and Professor Clausius proved this\r\nindependently and almost contemporaneously.\r\n\r\n429. For our own instruction we may produce the liquefaction of ice\r\nby pressure in the following way:--You remember the beautiful flowers\r\nobtained when a sunbeam is sent through lake ice (§ 11), and you have\r\nnot forgotten that the flowers always form parallel to the surface of\r\nfreezing. Let us cut a prism, or small column of ice with the planes\r\nof freezing running across it at right angles; we place that prism\r\nbetween two slabs of wood, and bring carefully to bear upon it the\r\nsqueezing force of a small hydraulic press.\r\n\r\n430. It is well to converge by means of a concave mirror a good light\r\nupon the ice, and to view it through a magnifying lens. You already\r\nsee the result. Hazy surfaces are formed in the very body of the\r\nice, which gradually expand as the pressure is slowly augmented.\r\nHere and there you notice something resembling crystallisation;\r\nfern-shaped figures run with considerable rapidity through the ice,\r\nand when you look carefully at their points and edges you find them\r\nin visible motion. These hazy surfaces are spaces of liquefaction,\r\nand the motion you see is that of the ice falling to water under the\r\npressure. That water is colder than the ice was before the pressure\r\nwas applied, and if the pressure be relieved, not only does the\r\nliquefaction cease, but the water re-freezes. The cold produced by\r\nits liquefaction under pressure is sufficient to re-congeal it when\r\nthe pressure is removed.\r\n\r\n431. If instead of diffusing the pressure over surfaces of\r\nconsiderable extent, we concentrate it on a small surface, the\r\nliquefaction will of course be more rapid, and this is what Mr.\r\nBottomley has recently done in an experiment of singular beauty and\r\ninterest. Let us support on blocks of wood the two ends of a bar of\r\nice 10 inches long, 4 inches deep, and 3 wide, and let us loop over\r\nits middle a copper wire one-twentieth, or even one-tenth, of an\r\ninch in thickness. Connecting the two ends of the wire together, and\r\nsuspending from it a weight of 12 or 14 pounds, the whole pressure\r\nof this weight is concentrated on the ice which supports the wire.\r\nWhat is the consequence? The ice underneath the wire liquefies; the\r\nwater of liquefaction escapes round the wire, but the moment it is\r\nrelieved from the pressure it freezes, and round about the wire, even\r\nbefore it has entered the ice, you have a frozen casing. The wire\r\ncontinues to sink in the ice; the water incessantly escapes, freezing\r\nas it does so behind the wire. In half an hour the weight falls; the\r\nwire has gone clean through the ice. You can plainly see where it\r\nhas passed, but the two severed pieces of ice are so firmly frozen\r\ntogether that they will break elsewhere as soon as along the surface\r\nof regelation.\r\n\r\n432. Another beautiful experiment bearing upon this point has\r\nrecently been made by M. Boussingault. He filled a hollow steel\r\ncylinder with water and chilled it. In passing to ice, water, as you\r\nknow, expands (§ 45); in fact, room for expansion is a necessary\r\ncondition of solidification. But in the present case the strong\r\nsteel resisted the expansion, the water in consequence remaining\r\nliquid at a temperature of more than 30° Fahr. below the ordinary\r\nfreezing point. A bullet within the cylinder rattled about at this\r\ntemperature, showing that the water was still liquid. On opening the\r\ntap the liquid, relieved of the pressure, was instantly converted\r\ninto ice.\r\n\r\n433. It is only substances which _expand_ on solidifying that behave\r\nin this manner. The metal bismuth, as we know, is an example similar\r\nto water; while lead, wax, or sulphur, all of which contract on\r\nsolidifying, have their point of fusion _heightened_ by pressure.\r\n\r\n434. And now you are prepared to understand Professor James Thomson's\r\ntheory of regelation. When two pieces of ice are pressed together\r\nliquefaction, he contends, results. The water spreads out around the\r\npoints of pressure, and when released re-freezes, thus forming a kind\r\nof cement between the pieces of ice.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 63. _Faraday's View of Regelation._\r\n\r\n435. Faraday's view of regelation is not so easily expressed, still\r\nI will try to give you some notion of it, dealing in the first place\r\nwith admitted facts. Water, even in open vessels, may be lowered many\r\ndegrees below its freezing temperature, and still remain liquid;\r\nit may also be raised to a temperature far higher than its boiling\r\npoint, and still resist boiling. This is due to the mutual cohesion\r\nof the water particles, which resists the change of the liquid\r\neither into the solid or the vaporous condition.\r\n\r\n436. But if into the over-chilled water you throw a particle of ice,\r\nthe cohesion is ruptured, and congelation immediately sets in. And if\r\ninto the superheated water you introduce a bubble of air or of steam,\r\ncohesion is likewise ruptured, and ebullition immediately commences.\r\n\r\n437. Faraday concluded that _in the interior_ of any body, whether\r\nsolid or liquid, where every particle is grasped so to speak by the\r\nsurrounding particles, and grasps them in turn, the bond of cohesion\r\nis so strong as to require a higher temperature to change the state\r\nof aggregation than is necessary _at the surface_. At the surface\r\nof a piece of ice, for example, the molecules are free on one side\r\nfrom the control of other molecules; and they therefore yield to\r\nheat more readily than in the interior. The bubble of air or steam\r\nin overheated water also frees the molecules on one side; hence the\r\nebullition consequent upon its introduction. Practically speaking,\r\nthen, the point of liquefaction of the interior ice is higher than\r\nthat of the superficial ice. Faraday also refers to the special\r\nsolidifying power which bodies exert upon their own molecules.\r\nCamphor in a glass bottle fills the bottle with an atmosphere of\r\ncamphor. In such an atmosphere large crystals of the substance may\r\ngrow by the incessant deposition of camphor molecules upon camphor,\r\nat a temperature too high to permit of the slightest deposit _upon\r\nthe adjacent glass_. A similar remark applies to sulphur, phosphorus,\r\nand the metals in a state of fusion. They are deposited upon solid\r\nportions of their own substance at temperatures not low enough to\r\ncause them to solidify against other substances.\r\n\r\n438. Water furnishes an eminent example of this special solidifying\r\npower. It may be cooled ten degrees and more below its freezing\r\npoint without freezing. But this is not possible if the smallest\r\nfragment of ice be floating in the water. It then freezes accurately\r\nat 32° Fahr., depositing itself, however, not upon the sides of the\r\ncontaining vessel, but _upon the ice_. Faraday observed in a freezing\r\napparatus thin crystals of ice growing in ice-cold water to a length\r\nof six, eight, or ten inches, at a temperature incompetent to produce\r\ntheir deposition upon the sides of the containing vessel.\r\n\r\n439. And now we are prepared for Faraday's view of regelation.\r\nWhen the surfaces of two pieces of ice, covered with a film of\r\nthe water of liquefaction, are brought together, the covering\r\nfilm is transferred from the surface to the centre of the ice,\r\nwhere the point of liquefaction, as before shown, is higher than\r\nat the surface. The special solidifying power of ice upon water\r\nis now brought into play _on both sides of the film_. Under these\r\ncircumstances, Faraday held that the film would congeal, and freeze\r\nthe two surfaces together.\r\n\r\n440. The lowering of the freezing point by pressure amounts to\r\nno more than one-seventieth of a degree Fahrenheit for a whole\r\natmosphere. Considering the infinitesimal fraction of this pressure\r\nwhich is brought into play in some cases of regelation, Faraday\r\nthought its effect insensible. He suspended pieces of ice, and\r\nbrought them into contact without sensible pressure, still they\r\nfroze together. Professor James Thomson, however, considered that\r\neven the capillary attraction exerted between two such masses would\r\nbe sufficient to produce regelation. You may make the following\r\nexperiments, in further illustration of this subject:--\r\n\r\n441. Place a small piece of ice in water, and press it underneath the\r\nsurface by a second piece. The submerged piece may be so small as to\r\nrender the pressure infinitesimal; still it will freeze to the under\r\nsurface of the superior piece.\r\n\r\n442. Place two pieces of ice in a basin of warm water, and allow them\r\nto come together; they freeze together when they touch. The parts\r\nsurrounding the place of contact melt away, but the pieces continue\r\nfor a time united by a narrow bridge of ice. The bridge finally\r\nmelts, and the pieces for a moment are separated. But capillary\r\nattraction immediately draws them together, and regelation sets in\r\nonce more. A new bridge is formed, which in its turn is dissolved,\r\nthe separated pieces again closing up. A kind of pulsation is thus\r\nestablished between the two pieces of ice. They touch, they freeze,\r\na bridge is formed and melted; and thus the rhythmic action continues\r\nuntil the ice disappears.\r\n\r\n443. According to Professor James Thomson's theory, pressure is\r\nnecessary to liquefy the ice. The heat necessary for liquefaction\r\nmust be drawn from the ice itself, and the cold water must escape\r\nfrom the pressure to be re-frozen. Now in the foregoing experiments\r\nthe cold water, instead of being allowed to freeze, _issues into\r\nthe warm water_, still the floating fragments regelate in a moment.\r\nThe touching surfaces may, moreover, be convex; they may be reduced\r\npractically to _points_, clasped all round by the warm water, which\r\nindeed rapidly dissolve them as they approach each other; still they\r\nfreeze immediately when they touch.\r\n\r\n444. You may learn from this discussion that in scientific matters,\r\nas in all others, there is room for differences of opinion. The frame\r\nof mind to be cultivated here is a suspension of judgment as long\r\nas the meaning remains in doubt. It may be that Faraday's action\r\nand Thomson's action come both into play. I cannot do better than\r\nfinish these remarks by quoting Faraday's own concluding words,\r\nwhich show how in his mind scientific conviction dwelt apart from\r\ndogmatism:--\"No doubt,\" he says, \"nice experiments will enable us\r\nhereafter to criticise such results as these, and separating the true\r\nfrom the untrue will establish the correct theory of regelation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 64. _The Blue Veins of Glaciers._\r\n\r\n445. We now approach the end, one important question only remaining\r\nto be discussed. Hitherto we have kept it back, for a wide\r\nacquaintance with the glaciers was necessary to its solution. We had\r\nalso to make ourselves familiar by actual experiment with the power\r\nof ice, softened by thaw, to yield to pressure, and to liquefy under\r\nsuch pressure.\r\n\r\n446. Snow is white. But if you examine its individual particles you\r\nwould call them _transparent_, not white. The whiteness arises from\r\nthe mixture of the ice particles with small spaces of air. In the\r\ncase of all transparent bodies whiteness results from such a mixture.\r\nThe clearest glass or crystal when crushed becomes a white powder.\r\nThe foam of champagne is white through the intimate admixture of a\r\ntransparent liquid with transparent carbonic acid gas. The whitest\r\npaper, moreover, is composed of fibres which are individually\r\ntransparent.\r\n\r\n447. It is not, however, the air or the gas, but the _optical\r\nseverance_ of the particles, giving rise to a multitude of reflexions\r\nof the white solar light at their surfaces, that produces the\r\nwhiteness.\r\n\r\n448. The whiteness of the surface of a clean glacier (112), and of\r\nthe icebergs of the Märgelin See (357), has been already referred to\r\na similar cause. The surface is broken into innumerable fissures by\r\nthe solar heat, the reflexion of solar light from the sides of the\r\nlittle fissures producing the observed appearance.\r\n\r\n449. In like manner if you freeze water in a test-tube by plunging it\r\ninto a freezing mixture, the ice produced is white. For the most part\r\nalso the ice formed in freezing machines is white. Examine such, ice,\r\nand you will find it filled with small air-bubbles. When the freezing\r\nis extremely slow the crystallising force pushes the air effectually\r\naside, and the resulting ice is transparent; when the freezing is\r\nrapid, the air is entangled before it can escape, and the ice is\r\n_translucent_. But even in the case of quick freezing Mr. Faraday\r\nobtained transparent ice by skilfully removing the air-bubbles as\r\nfast as they appeared with a feather.\r\n\r\n450. In the case of lake ice the freezing is not uniform, but\r\nintermittent. It is sometimes slow, sometimes rapid. When slow the\r\nair dissolved in the water is effectually squeezed out and forms a\r\nlayer of bubbles on the under-surface of the ice. An act of sudden\r\nfreezing entangles the air, and hence we find lake ice usually\r\ncomposed of layers alternately clear, and filled with bubbles. Such\r\nlayers render it easy to detect the planes of freezing in lake ice.\r\n\r\n451. And now for the bearing of these facts. Under the fall of the\r\nGéant, at the base of the Talèfre cascade, and lower down the Mer\r\nde Glace; in the higher regions of the Grindelwald, the Aar, the\r\nAletsch and the Görner glaciers, the ice does not possess the\r\ntransparency which it exhibits near the ends of the glaciers. It\r\nis white, or whitish. Why? Examination shows it to be filled with\r\nsmall air-bubbles; and these, as we now learn, are the cause of its\r\nwhiteness.\r\n\r\n452. They are the residue of the air originally entangled in the\r\nsnow, and connected, as before stated, with the whiteness of the\r\nsnow. During the descent of the glacier, the bubbles are gradually\r\nexpelled by the enormous pressures brought to bear upon the ice.\r\nNot only is the expulsion caused by the mechanical yielding of the\r\nsoft thawing ice, but the liquefaction of the substance at places of\r\nviolent pressure, opening, as it does, fissures for the escape of the\r\nair, must play an important part in the consolidation of the glacier.\r\n\r\n453. The expulsion of the bubbles is, however, not uniform; for\r\nneither ice nor any other substance offers an absolutely uniform\r\nresistance to pressure. At the base of every cascade that we have\r\nvisited, and on the walls of the crevasses there formed, we have\r\nnoticed innumerable blue streaks drawn through the white translucent\r\nice, and giving the whole mass the appearance of lamination. These\r\nblue veins turned out upon examination to be spaces from which the\r\nair-bubbles had been almost wholly expelled, translucency being thus\r\nconverted into transparency.\r\n\r\n454. This is the _veined_ or _ribboned structure_ of glaciers,\r\nregarding the origin of which diverse opinions are now entertained.\r\n\r\n455. It is now our duty to take up the problem, and to solve it if we\r\ncan. On the névés of the Col du Géant, and other glaciers, we have\r\nfound great cracks, and faults, and _Bergschrunds_, exposing deep\r\nsections of the névé; and on these sections we have found marked the\r\nedges of half-consolidated strata evidently produced by successive\r\nfalls of snow. The névé is stratified because its supply of material\r\nfrom the atmosphere is intermittent, and when we first observed\r\nthe blue veins we were disposed to regard them as due to this\r\nstratification.\r\n\r\n456. But observation and reflexion soon dispelled this notion. Indeed\r\nit could hardly stand in the presence of the single fact that at the\r\nbases of the ice-falls the veins are always _vertical_, or nearly so.\r\nWe saw no way of explaining how the horizontal strata of the névé\r\ncould be so tilted up at the base of the fall as to be set on edge.\r\nNor is the aspect of the veins that of stratification.\r\n\r\n457. On the central portions of the cascades, moreover, there are\r\nno signs of the veins. At the bases they first appear, reaching in\r\neach case their maximum development a little below the base. As you\r\nand I stood upon the heights above the Zäsenberg and scrutinised the\r\ncascade of the Strahleck branch of the Grindelwald glacier, we could\r\nnot doubt that the base of the fall was the birthplace of the veins.\r\nWe called this portion of the glacier a \"Structure Mill,\" intimating\r\nthat here, and not on the névé, the veined structure was manufactured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SECTION OF ICEFALL, AND GLACIER BELOW IT, SHOWING\r\nORIGIN OF VEINED STRUCTURE.]\r\n\r\n458. This, however, is, at bottom, the language of strong _opinion_\r\nmerely, not that of _demonstration_; and in science opinion ought to\r\ncontent us only so long as positive proof is unattainable. The love\r\nof repose must not prevent us from seeking this proof. There is no\r\nsterner conscience than the scientific conscience, and it demands,\r\nin every possible case, the substitution for private conviction of\r\ndemonstration which shall be conclusive to all.\r\n\r\n459. Let us, for example, be shown a case in which the stratification\r\nof the névé is prolonged into the glacier; let us see the planes of\r\nbedding and the planes of lamination existing side by side, and still\r\nindubitably distinct. Such an observation would effectually exclude\r\nstratification from the problem of the veined structure, and through\r\nthe removal of this tempting source of error, we should be rendered\r\nmore free to pursue the truth.\r\n\r\n460. We sought for this conclusive test upon the Mer de Glace,\r\nbut did not find it. We sought it on the Grindelwald, and the Aar\r\nglaciers,[J] with an equal want of success. On the Aletsch glacier,\r\nfor the first time, we observed the apparent coexistence of bedding\r\nand structure, the one _cutting_ the other upon the walls of the same\r\ncrevasse. Still the case was not sufficiently pronounced to produce\r\nentire conviction, and we visited the Görner glacier with the view of\r\nfollowing up our quest.\r\n\r\n[J] M. Agassiz, however, reports a case of the kind upon the glacier\r\nof the Aar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STRUCTURE AND BEDDING ON ALETSCH GLACIER.]\r\n\r\n461. Here day after day added to the conviction that the bedding and\r\nthe structure were two different things. Still day after day passed\r\nwithout revealing to us the final proof. Surely we have not let our\r\nown ease stand in the way of its attainment, and if we retire baffled\r\nwe shall do so with the consciousness of having done our best.\r\nYonder, however, at the base of the Matterhorn, is the Furgge glacier\r\nthat we have not yet explored. Upon it our final attempt must be made.\r\n\r\n462. We get upon the glacier near its end, and ascend it. We are soon\r\nfronted by a barrier composed of three successive walls of névé, the\r\none rising above the other, and each retreating behind the other. The\r\nbottom of each wall is separated from the top of the succeeding one\r\nby a ledge, on which threatening masses of broken névé now rest. We\r\nstand amid blocks and rubbish which have been evidently discharged\r\nfrom these ledges, on which other masses, ready apparently to tumble,\r\nare now poised.\r\n\r\n463. On the vertical walls of this barrier we see, marked with the\r\nutmost plainness, the horizontal lines of stratification, while\r\nsomething exceedingly like the veined structure appears to cross the\r\nlines of bedding at nearly a right angle. The vertical surface is,\r\nhowever weathered, and the lines of structure, if they be such, are\r\nindistinct. The problem now is to remove the surface, and expose the\r\nice underneath. It is one of the many cases that have come before\r\nus, where the value of an observation is to be balanced against the\r\ndanger which it involves.\r\n\r\n464. We do nothing rashly; but scanning the ledges and selecting a\r\npoint of attack, we conclude that the danger is not too great to\r\nbe incurred. We advance to the wall, remove the surface, and are\r\nrewarded by the discovery underneath it of the true blue veins. They,\r\nmoreover, are vertical, while the bedding is horizontal. Bruce, as\r\nyou know, was defeated in many a battle, but he persisted and won at\r\nlast. Here, upon the Furgge glacier, you also have fought and won\r\nyour little Bannockburn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STRUCTURE AND BEDDING ON FURGGE GLACIER.]\r\n\r\n465. But let us not use the language of victory too soon. The\r\nstratification theory has been removed out of the field of\r\nexplanation, but nothing has as yet been offered in its place.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 65. _Relation of Structure to Pressure._\r\n\r\n466. This veined structure was first described by the distinguished\r\nSwiss naturalist, Guyot, now a resident in the United States. From\r\nthe Grimsel Pass I have already pointed out to you the Gries glacier\r\noverspreading the mountains at the opposite side of the valley of the\r\nRhone. It was on this glacier that M. Guyot made his observation.\r\n\r\n467. \"I saw,\" he said, \"under my feet the surface of the entire\r\nglacier covered with regular furrows, from one to two inches wide,\r\nhollowed out in a half-snowy mass, and separated by protruding plates\r\nof harder and more transparent ice. It was evident that the glacier\r\nhere was composed of two kinds of ice, one that of the furrows,\r\nsnowy and more easily melted; the other of the plates, more perfect,\r\ncrystalline, glassy, and resistant; and that the unequal resistance\r\nwhich the two kinds of ice presented to the atmosphere was the cause\r\nof the ridges.\r\n\r\n468. \"After having followed them for several hundred yards, I reached\r\na crevasse twenty or thirty feet wide, which, as it cut the plates\r\nand furrows at right angles, exposed the interior of the glacier to\r\na depth of thirty or forty feet, and gave a beautiful transverse\r\nsection of the structure. As far as my eyes could reach, I saw\r\nthe mass of the glacier composed of layers of snowy ice, each two\r\nof which were separated by one of the hard plates of which I have\r\nspoken, the whole forming a regularly laminated mass, which resembled\r\ncertain calcareous slates.\"\r\n\r\n469. I have not failed to point out to you upon all the glaciers\r\nthat we have visited the little superficial furrows here described;\r\nand you have, moreover, noticed that in the furrows mainly is lodged\r\nthe finer dirt which is scattered over the glacier. They suggest\r\nthe passage of a rake over the ice. And whenever these furrows were\r\ninterrupted by a crevasse, the veined structure invariably revealed\r\nitself upon the walls of the fissure. The surface grooving is indeed\r\nan infallible indication of the interior lamination of the ice.\r\n\r\n470. We have tracked the structure through the various parts of the\r\nglaciers at which its appearance was most distinct; and we have\r\npaid particular attention to the condition of the ice at these\r\nplaces. The very fact of its cutting the crevasses at right angles\r\nis significant. We know the mechanical origin of the crevasses; that\r\nthey are cracks formed at right angles to lines of tension. But since\r\nthe crevasses are also perpendicular to the planes of structure,\r\nthese planes must be parallel to the lines of tension.\r\n\r\n471. On the glaciers, however, tension rarely occurs alone. At the\r\nsides of the glacier, for example, where marginal crevasses are\r\nformed, the tension is always accompanied by pressure; the one\r\nforce acting at right angles to the other. Here, therefore, the\r\nveined structure, which is parallel to the lines of tension, _is\r\nperpendicular to the lines of pressure_.\r\n\r\n472. That this is so will be evident to you in a moment. Let the\r\nadjacent figure represent the channel of the glacier moving in the\r\ndirection of the arrow. Suppose three circles to be marked upon the\r\nice, one at the centre and the two others at the sides. In a glacier\r\nof uniform inclination all these circles would move downward, the\r\ncentral one only remaining a circle. By the retardation of the sides\r\nthe marginal circles would be drawn out to ovals. The two circles\r\nwould be _elongated_ in one direction, and _compressed_ in another.\r\nAcross the long diameter, which is the direction of strain, we have\r\nthe marginal crevasses; across the short diameter _m n_, which is the\r\ndirection of pressure, we have the _marginal veined structure_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n473. This association of pressure and structure is invariable. At\r\nthe bases of the cascades, where the inclination of the bed of the\r\nglacier suddenly changes, the pressure in many cases suffices not\r\nonly to close the crevasses but to violently squeeze the ice. At\r\nsuch places the structure always appears, sweeping quite across\r\nthe glacier. When two branch glaciers unite, their mutual thrust\r\nintensifies the pre-existing marginal structure of the branches,\r\nand developes new planes of lamination. Under the medial moraines,\r\ntherefore, we have usually a good development of the structure. It\r\nis finely displayed, for example, under the great medial moraine of\r\nthe glacier of the Aar.\r\n\r\n474. Upon this glacier, indeed, the blue veins were observed\r\nindependently three years after M. Guyot had first described them. I\r\nsay independently, because M. Guyot's description, though written in\r\n1838, remained imprinted, and was unknown in 1841 to the observers on\r\nthe Aar. These were M. Agassiz and Professor Forbes. To the question\r\nof structure Professor Forbes subsequently devoted much attention,\r\nand it was mainly his observations and reasonings that gave it the\r\nimportant position now assigned to it in the phenomena of glaciers.\r\n\r\n475. Thus without quitting the glaciers themselves, we establish\r\nthe connexion between pressure and structure. Is there anything in\r\nour previous scientific experience with which these facts may be\r\nconnected? The new knowledge of nature must always strike its roots\r\ninto the old, and spring from it as an organic growth.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 66. _Slate Cleavage and Glacier Lamination_.\r\n\r\n476. M. Guyot threw out an exceedingly sagacious hint, when he\r\ncompared the veined structure to the cleavage of slate rocks. We must\r\nlearn something of this cleavage, for it really furnishes the key to\r\nthe problem which now occupies us. Let us go then to the quarries\r\nof Bangor or Cumberland, and observe the quarrymen in their sheds\r\nsplitting the rocks. With a sharp point struck skilfully into the\r\nedge of the slate, they cause it to divide into thin plates, fit for\r\nroofing or ciphering, as the case may be. The surfaces along which\r\nthe rock cleaves are called its _planes of cleavage_.\r\n\r\n477. All through the quarry you notice the direction of these planes\r\nto be perfectly constant. How is this laminated structure to be\r\naccounted for?\r\n\r\n478. You might be disposed to consider that cleavage is a case of\r\nstratification or bedding; for it is true that in various parts of\r\nEngland there are rocks which can be cloven into thin flags along the\r\nplanes of bedding. But when we examine these slate rocks we verify\r\nthe observation, first I believe made by the eminent and venerable\r\nProfessor Sedgwick, that the planes of bedding usually run across the\r\nplanes of cleavage.\r\n\r\n479. We have here, as you observe, a case exactly similar to that of\r\nglacier lamination, which we were at first disposed to regard as due\r\nto stratification. We afterwards, however, found planes of lamination\r\ncrossing the layers of the névé, exactly as the planes of cleavage\r\ncross the beds of slate rocks.\r\n\r\n480. But the analogy extends further. Slate cleavage continued to\r\nbe a puzzle to geologists till the late Mr. Daniel Sharpe made the\r\ndiscovery that shells and other fossils and bodies found in slate\r\nrocks are invariably flattened out in the planes of cleavage.\r\n\r\n481. Turn into any well-arranged museum--for example, into the School\r\nof Mines in Jermyn Street, and observe the evidence there collected.\r\nLook particularly to the fossil trilobites taken from the slate rock.\r\nThey are in some cases squeezed to one third of their primitive\r\nthickness. Numerous other specimens show in the most striking manner\r\nthe flattening out of shells.\r\n\r\n482. To the evidence adduced by Mr. Sharpe, Mr. Sorby added other\r\npowerful evidence, founded upon the microscopic examination of slate\r\nrock. Taking both into account, the conclusion is irresistible that\r\nsuch rocks have suffered enormous pressure at right angles to the\r\nplanes of cleavage, exactly as the glacier has demonstrably suffered\r\ngreat pressure at right angles to its planes of lamination.\r\n\r\n483. The association of pressure and cleavage is thus demonstrated;\r\nbut the question arises, do they stand to each other in the relation\r\nof cause and effect? The only way of replying to this question is to\r\ncombine artificially the conditions of nature, and see whether we\r\ncannot produce her results.\r\n\r\n484. The substance of slate rocks was once a plastic mud, in which\r\nfossils were embedded. Let us imitate the action of pressure upon\r\nsuch mud by employing, instead of it, softened white wax. Placing a\r\nball of the wax between two glass plates, wetted to prevent it from\r\nsticking, we apply pressure and flatten out the wax.\r\n\r\n485. The flattened mass is at first too soft to cleave sharply; but\r\nyou can see, by tearing, that it is laminated. Let us chill it with\r\nice. We find afterwards that no slate rock ever exhibited so fine a\r\ncleavage. The laminæ, it need hardly be said, are perpendicular to\r\nthe pressure.\r\n\r\n486. One cause of this lamination is that the wax is an aggregate\r\nof granules the surfaces of which are places of weak cohesion; and\r\nthat by the pressure these granules are squeezed flat, thus producing\r\nplanes of weakness at right angles to the pressure.\r\n\r\n487. But the main cause of the cleavage I take to be the lateral\r\nsliding of the particles of wax over each other. Old attachments\r\nare thereby severed, which the new ones fail to make good. Thus the\r\ntangential sliding produces lamination, as the rails near a station\r\nare caused to exfoliate by the gliding of the wheel.\r\n\r\n488. Instead of wax we may take the slate itself, grind it to fine\r\npowder, add water, and thus reproduce the pristine mud. By the proper\r\ncompression of such mud, in one direction, the cleavage is restored.\r\n\r\n489. Call now to mind the evidences we have had of the power of\r\nthawing ice to yield to pressure. Recollect the shortening of the\r\nGlacier du Géant, and the squeezing of the Glacier de Léchaud, at\r\nTrélaporte. Such a substance, slowly acted upon by pressure, will\r\nyield laterally. Its particles will slide over each other, the\r\nsevered attachments being immediately made good by regelation. It\r\nwill not yield uniformly, but along special planes. It will also\r\nliquefy, not uniformly, but along special surfaces. Both the sliding\r\nand the liquefaction will take place principally at right angles to\r\nthe pressure, and glacier lamination is the result.\r\n\r\n490. As long as it is sound the laminated glacier ice resists\r\ncleavage. Regelation, as I have said, makes the severed attachments\r\ngood. But when such ice is exposed to the weather the structure is\r\nrevealed, and the ice can then be cloven into tablets a square foot,\r\nor even a square yard in area.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ 67. _Conclusion_.\r\n\r\n491. Here, my friend, our labours close. It has been a true pleasure\r\nto me to have you at my side so long. In the sweat of our brows we\r\nhave often reached the heights where our work lay, but you have been\r\nsteadfast and industrious throughout, using in all possible cases\r\nyour own muscles instead of relying upon mine. Here and there I have\r\nstretched an arm and helped you to a ledge, but the work of climbing\r\nhas been almost exclusively your own. It is thus that I should like\r\nto teach you all things; showing you the way to profitable exertion,\r\nbut leaving the exertion to you more anxious to bring out your\r\nmanliness in the presence of difficulty than to make your way smooth\r\nby toning difficulties down.\r\n\r\n492. Steadfast, prudent, without terror, though not at all times\r\nwithout awe, I have found you on rock and ice, and you have shown\r\nthe still rarer quality of steadfastness in intellectual effort. As\r\nhere set forth, our task seems plain enough, but you and I know how\r\noften we have had to wrangle resolutely with the facts to bring out\r\ntheir meaning. The work, however, is now done, and you are master of\r\na fragment of that sure and certain knowledge which is founded on the\r\nfaithful study of nature. Is it not worth the price paid for it? Or\r\nrather, was not the paying of the price the healthful, if sometimes\r\nhard, exercise of mind and body, upon alp and glacier--a portion of\r\nour delight?\r\n\r\n493. Here then we part. And should we not meet again, the memory of\r\nthese days will still unite us. Give me your hand. Good bye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A\r\n\r\n  Accurate measurements of the motions of glaciers, by Agassiz and\r\n    Forbes, 60-62.\r\n  Æggischhorn, view from the, 137.\r\n  Agassiz's
