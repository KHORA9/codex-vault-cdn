The attendants are the planets,\r\ncommonly so called, together with a certain number of comets. I shall\r\ndeal with all these objects rather from a descriptive and practical than\r\nfrom a speculative or essay point of view, and with special reference to\r\nthe convenience and opportunities of persons possessing, or having\r\naccess to, what may be called popular telescopes—telescopes say of from\r\ntwo to four inches of aperture, and costing any sum between £10 and £50.\r\nThere is much pleasure and profit to be got out of telescopes of this\r\ntype, always presuming that they are used by persons possessed of\r\npatience and perseverance. It is a very great mistake, though an\r\nextremely common one, to suppose that unless a man can command a big\r\ntelescope he can do no useful work, and derive no pleasure from his\r\nwork. To all such croakers I always point as a moral the achievements of\r\nHermann Goldschmidt, who from an attic window at Fontenay-aux-Roses near\r\nParis, with a telescope of only 2½ inches aperture, discovered no fewer\r\nthan 14 minor planets.\r\n\r\nAs this volume is intended for general reading, rather than for\r\neducational or technical purposes, I have kept statistical details and\r\nnumerical expressions within very narrow limits, mere figures being\r\nalways more or less unattractive.\r\n\r\nJohn Richard Green, in the Preface to his book on _The Making of\r\nEngland_, writes as follows:—“I may add, in explanation of the\r\nreappearance of a few passages ... which my readers may have seen\r\nbefore, that where I had little or nothing to add or to change, I have\r\npreferred to insert a passage from previous work, with the requisite\r\nconnections and references, to the affectation of rewriting such a\r\npassage for the mere sake of giving it an air of novelty.” I will\r\nventure to adopt this thought as my own, and to apply it to the\r\nrepetition, here and there, of ideas and phrases which are already to be\r\nfound in my _Handbook of Astronomy_.\r\n\r\n                                                                G.

The\r\nstatement just made may be regarded as a general truth, but as the\r\nstrictest accuracy on scientific matters is of the utmost importance, a\r\ntrivial reservation must perhaps be put upon the foregoing broad\r\nassertion. There is some reason for thinking that possibly one of the\r\nplanets (Jupiter) possesses a little inherent light of its own which is\r\nnot borrowed from the Sun; whilst of the comets it must certainly be\r\nsaid that, as a rule, they shine with intrinsic, not borrowed light.\r\nRespecting these reservations more hereafter.\r\n\r\nThe planets are divided into “primary” and “secondary.” By a “primary”\r\nplanet we mean one which directly circulates round the Sun; by a\r\n“secondary” planet we mean one which in the first instance circulates\r\nround a primary planet, and therefore only in a secondary sense\r\ncirculates round the Sun. The planets are also “major” or “minor”; this,\r\nhowever, is only a distinction of size.\r\n\r\nThe secondary planets are usually termed “satellites,” or, very often,\r\nin popular language, “moons,” because they own allegiance to their\r\nrespective primaries just as our Moon—_the_ Moon—does to the Earth. But\r\nthe use of the term “moon” is inconvenient, and it is better to stick to\r\n“satellite.”\r\n\r\nThere is yet another method of classifying the planets which has its\r\nadvantages. They are sometimes divided into “inferior” and “superior.”\r\nThe “inferior” planets are those which travel round the Sun in orbits\r\nwhich are inside the Earth’s orbit; the “superior” planets are those\r\nwhose orbits are outside the Earth.\r\n\r\nThe following is an enumeration of the major planets in the order of\r\ntheir distances, reckoning from the Sun outwards:—\r\n\r\n  1. Mercury.\r\n  2. Venus.\r\n  3. The Earth.\r\n  4. Mars.\r\n  5. Jupiter.\r\n  6. Saturn.\r\n  7. Uranus.\r\n  8. Neptune.\r\n\r\nAll the above are major planets and also primary planets. In between\r\nNos. 4 and 5 circulate the “Minor” planets, an ever-increasing body, now\r\nmore than 400 in number, but all, except one or perhaps two, invisible\r\nto the naked eye.\r\n\r\nThe “Inferior” planets it will be seen from the above table comprise\r\nMercury and Venus, whilst the “Superior” planets are Mars and all those\r\nbeyond.\r\n\r\nGreat differences exist in the inclinations of the orbits of the\r\ndifferent planets to the plane of the ecliptic, a fact which is better\r\nshown by a diagram than by a table of mere figures. The orbit of Uranus\r\nis indeed so much inclined that its motion is really _retrograde_\r\ncompared with the general run of the planets: and the same remark\r\napplies, though much more forcibly, to the case of Neptune.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.—Inclination of Planetary Orbits.]\r\n\r\nThe actual movements of the planets round the Sun are extremely simple,\r\nfor they do nought else but go on, and on, and on, incessantly, always\r\nin the same direction, and almost, though not quite, at a uniform pace,\r\nthough in orbits very variously inclined to the plane of the ecliptic.\r\nBut an element of extreme complication is introduced into their apparent\r\nmovements by reason of the fact that we are obliged to study the planets\r\nfrom one of their own number, which is itself always in motion.\r\n\r\nIf the Earth itself were a fixture, the study of the movements of the\r\nplanets would be a comparatively easy matter, whilst to an observer on\r\nthe Sun it would be a supremely easy matter.\r\n\r\nGreatly as the planets differ among themselves in their sizes, distances\r\nfrom the Sun, and physical peculiarities, they have certain things in\r\ncommon, and it will be well to make this matter clear before we go into\r\nmore recondite topics. For instance, not only do they move incessantly\r\nround the Sun in the same direction at a nearly uniform pace, but the\r\nplanes of their orbits are very little inclined to the common plane of\r\nreference, the ecliptic, or to one another.[1] The direction of motion\r\nof the planets as viewed from the north side of the ecliptic is contrary\r\nto the motion of the hands of a watch. Their orbits, unlike the orbits\r\nof comets, are nearly circular, that is, they are only very slightly\r\noval. Agreeably to the principles of what is known as the Law of\r\nUniversal Gravitation, the speed with which they move in their orbits is\r\ngreatest in those parts which lie nearest the Sun, and least in those\r\nparts which are most remote from the Sun; in other words, they move\r\nquickest in Perihelion and slowest in Aphelion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.—Comparative Sizes of the Major Planets.]\r\n\r\nThe physical peculiarities which the planets have in common include the\r\nfollowing points:—they are opaque bodies, and shine by reflecting light\r\nwhich they receive from the Sun. Probably all of them are endued with an\r\naxial rotation, hence their inhabitants, if there are any, have the\r\nalternation of day and night, like the inhabitants of the Earth, but the\r\nduration of their days, measured in absolute terrestrial hours, will in\r\nmost cases differ materially from the days and nights with which we are\r\nfamiliar.\r\n\r\nI stated on a previous page that, owing to the circumstances in which we\r\nfind ourselves on the Earth, the apparent and real movements of the\r\nplanets are widely different. It would be beyond the scope of this\r\nlittle work to go into these differences in any considerable detail;\r\nsuffice it then to indicate only a few general points. In the first\r\nplace, an important distinction exists between the visible movements of\r\nthe inferior and superior planets. The inferior planets, Mercury and\r\nVenus, lying as they do within the orbit of the Earth, are much\r\nrestricted in their movements, in the sky. We can never see them except\r\nwhen they are more or less near to the rising (or risen) or setting (or\r\nset) Sun. The extreme angular distance from the Sun in the sky to which\r\nMercury can attain is but 27°, and therefore we can never observe it\r\notherwise than in sunlight or twilight, for it never rises more than 1½\r\nhours before sunrise nor sets later than 1½ hours after sunset. Of\r\ncourse between these limits the planet is above the horizon all the time\r\nthat the Sun is above the horizon, but except in very large telescopes\r\nis not usually to be detected during the day-time. These remarks\r\nregarding Mercury apply likewise in principle to Venus; only the orbit\r\nof Venus being larger than the orbit of Mercury, and Venus itself being\r\nlarger in size than Mercury, the application of these principles leads\r\nto somewhat different results. The greatest possible distance of Venus\r\nmay be 47° instead of Mercury’s 27°. Venus is therefore somewhat more\r\nemancipated from the effects of twilight. The body of Venus being also\r\nvery much larger and brighter than the body of Mercury, it may be more\r\noften and more easily detected in broad daylight.\r\n\r\nIt follows from the foregoing statement that the inferior planets can\r\nnever be seen in those regions of the heavens which are, as it is\r\ntechnically called, in “Opposition” to the Sun; that is, which are on\r\nthe meridian at midnight whilst the Sun is on the meridian in its midday\r\nsplendour to places on the opposite side of the Earth. On the other\r\nhand, the two inferior planets on stated, though rare, occasions exhibit\r\nto a terrestrial spectator certain phenomena of great interest and\r\nimportance in which no superior planet can ever take part. I am here\r\nreferring to the “Transits” of Mercury and Venus across the Sun. If\r\nthese planets and the Earth all revolved round the Sun exactly in the\r\nplane of the ecliptic, transits of these planets would be perpetually\r\nrecurring after even intervals of only a few months; but the fact that\r\nthe orbit of Mercury is inclined 7°, and that of Venus about 3½, to the\r\necliptic, involves such complications that transits of Mercury only\r\noccur at unequal intervals of several years, whilst, in extreme cases,\r\nmore than a century may elapse between two successive transits of Venus.\r\nFor a transit of an inferior planet over the Sun to take place, the\r\nEarth and the planet and the Sun must be exactly in the same straight\r\nline, reckoned both vertically and horizontally. Twice in every\r\nrevolution round the Sun an inferior planet is vertically in the same\r\nstraight line with the Earth and the Sun; and it is said to be in\r\n“inferior conjunction” when the planet comes between the Earth and the\r\nSun; and in “superior conjunction” when the planet is on the further\r\nside of the Sun, the Sun intervening between the Earth and the planet.\r\nBut for all three to be horizontally in the same straight line is quite\r\nanother matter. It is the orbital inclinations of Mercury and Venus\r\nwhich enable them, so to speak, to dodge an observer who is on the\r\nlookout to see them pass exactly in front of the Sun, or to disappear\r\nbehind the Sun; and so it comes about that a favourable combination of\r\ncircumstances which is rare is needed before either of the aforesaid\r\nplanets can be seen as round black spots passing in front of the Sun. A\r\npassage of either of these planets behind the Sun could never be seen by\r\nhuman eye, because of the overpowering brilliancy of the Sun’s rays,\r\neven though an Astronomer might know by his calculations the exact\r\nmoment that the planet was going to pass behind the Sun.\r\n\r\nWhen an inferior planet attains its greatest angular distance from the\r\nSun, as we see it (which I have already stated to be about 27° in the\r\ncase of Mercury and 47° in the case of Venus), such planet is said to be\r\nat its “greatest elongation,” “east” or “west,” as the case may be. At\r\neastern elongation or indeed whenever the planet is east of the Sun, it\r\nis, to use a familiar phrase, an “evening star”; on the other hand, at\r\nwestern elongation, or whenever it is on the western side of the Sun, it\r\nis known as a “morning star.”\r\n\r\nIf the movements of an inferior planet are followed sufficiently long by\r\nthe aid of a star map, it will be seen that sometimes it appears to be\r\nproceeding in a forward direction through the signs of the zodiac; then\r\nfor a while it will seem to stand still; then at another time it will\r\napparently go backwards, or possess a retrograde motion. All these\r\npeculiarities have their originating cause in the motion of the Earth\r\nitself, for the absolute movement of the planet never varies, being\r\nalways in the same direction, that is, forwards in the order of the\r\nsigns.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the superior planets, we have to face an altogether\r\ndifferent succession of circumstances. A superior planet is not, as it\r\nwere, chained to the Sun so as to be unable to escape beyond the limits\r\nof morning or evening twilight; it may have any angular distance from\r\nthe Sun up to 180°, reaching which point it approaches the Sun on the\r\nopposite side, step by step, until it again comes into conjunction with\r\nthe Sun. As applied to a superior planet, the term “conjunction” means\r\nthe absolute moment when the Earth and the Sun and the planet are in the\r\nsame straight line, the Sun being in the middle. In such a case, to us\r\non the Earth the planet is lost in the Sun’s rays, whilst to a spectator\r\non the planet the Earth would appear similarly lost in the Sun’s rays,\r\nas the Earth would be at that stage of her orbit which we, speaking of\r\n_our_ inferior planets, call superior conjunction.\r\n\r\nFor a clear comprehension of all the various matters which we have just\r\nbeen speaking of, a careful study of diagrams of a geometrical\r\ncharacter, or better still, of models, would be necessary.\r\n\r\nSomething must now be said about the phases of the planets. Mercury and\r\nVenus, in regard to their orbital motions, stand very much on the same\r\nfooting with respect to the inhabitants of the Earth as the Moon does,\r\nand accordingly both those planets in their periodical circuits round\r\nthe Sun exhibit the same succession of phases as the Moon does. In the\r\ncase, however, of the superior planets things are otherwise. Two only of\r\nthem, Mars and Jupiter, are sufficiently near the Earth to exhibit any\r\nphase at all. When they are in quadrature (_i. e._, 90° from the Sun on\r\neither side) there is a slight loss of light to be noticed along one\r\nlimb. In other words, the disc of each ceases for a short time, and to a\r\nslight extent, to be truly circular; it becomes what is known as\r\n“gibbous.” This occasional feature of Mars may be fairly conspicuous,\r\nor, at least, noticeable; but in the case of Jupiter it will be less\r\nobvious unless a telescope of some size is employed.\r\n\r\nIf the major planets are arbitrarily ranged in two groups, Mercury,\r\nVenus, the Earth and Mars being taken as an interior group,\r\ncomparatively near the Sun; whilst Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune\r\nare regarded as an exterior group, being at a great distance from the\r\nSun, it will be found that some important physical differences exist\r\nbetween the two groups.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.—Comparative size of the Sun as seen from the\r\nPlanets named.]\r\n\r\nOf the interior planets, the Earth and Mars alone have satellites, and\r\nbetween them make up a total of only three. The exterior planets, on the\r\nother hand, all have satellites, the total number being certainly\r\nseventeen, and possibly eighteen. In detail, Jupiter has four, Saturn\r\neight, Uranus four, and Neptune one, and perhaps two. These facts may be\r\nregarded as an instance of the beneficence of the Creator of the\r\nUniverse if we consider that the satellites of these remoter planets are\r\nso numerous, in order that by their numbers they may do something to\r\nmake up for the small amount of light which, owing to their distance\r\nfrom the Sun, their primaries receive. Then again, the average density\r\nof the first group of planets greatly exceeds the average density of the\r\nsecond group in the approximate ratio of 5 to 1. Finally, there is\r\nreason to believe that a marked difference exists in the axial rotations\r\nof the planets forming the two groups. We do not know the precise\r\nfigures for all the exterior planets, but the knowledge which we do\r\npossess seems to imply that the average length of the day in the case of\r\nthe interior planets is about twenty-four hours, but that in the case of\r\nthe exterior planets it is no more than about ten hours. These figures\r\ncan, however, only be presented as possibly true, because observations\r\non the rotation periods of Mercury and Venus on the one hand, and of\r\nUranus and Neptune on the other, are attended with so much difficulty\r\nthat the recorded results are of doubtful trustworthiness. It is,\r\nhowever, reasonable to presume that the actual size of the respective\r\nplanets has more to do with the matter than their distances from the\r\nSun.\r\n\r\nI think that the foregoing summary respecting the planets collectively\r\nembraces as many points as are likely to be of interest to the\r\ngenerality of readers; we will therefore pass on to consider somewhat in\r\ndetail the several constituent members of the solar system, beginning\r\nwith the Sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II.\r\n                                THE SUN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was once a book published, the title of which was “The Sun, Ruler,\r\nFire, Light and Life of the Planetary System.” The title was by no means\r\na bad one, for without doubt the Sun may fairly be said to represent\r\npractically all the ideas conveyed by the designations quoted.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly no one body in creation which is so emphatically\r\npre-eminent as the Sun. Whether or no there are stars which are\r\nsuns—centres of systems serving in their degree the purposes served by\r\nour Sun, I need not now pause to enquire, though I think the idea is a\r\nvery probable one; but of those celestial objects with which our Earth\r\nhas a direct relationship, beyond doubt the Sun is unquestionably\r\nentitled to the foremost place. It is, as it were, the pivot on which\r\nthe Earth and all the various bodies comprising the Solar System revolve\r\nin their annual progress. It is our source of light and heat, and\r\ntherefore may be called the great agent by which an Almighty Providence\r\nwills to sustain animal and vegetable life. The consideration of all the\r\ncomplicated questions which arise out of these functions of the Sun\r\nbelongs to the domain of Physics rather than that of Astronomy; still\r\nthese matters are of such momentous interest that an allusion to them\r\nmust be made, for they ought not to be lost sight of by the student of\r\nAstronomy. Half a century ago the actual state of our knowledge\r\nrespecting the Sun might without difficulty be brought within the\r\ncompass of a single chapter in any book on Astronomy, but so enormous\r\nhas been the development of knowledge respecting the Sun of late years,\r\nthat it is no longer a question of getting the materials properly into\r\none chapter, but it is a matter of a whole volume being devoted to the\r\nSun, or even, as in the case of Secchi, of two large octavo volumes of\r\n500 pages each being required to cover the whole ground exhaustively.\r\nThe reader will therefore easily understand that in the space at my\r\ndisposal in this little work nothing but a passing glimpse can possibly\r\nbe obtained of this great subject. It is great not only in regard to the\r\nvast array of purely astronomical facts which are at a writer’s command,\r\nbut also on account of the extensive ramifications which the subject has\r\ninto the domains of chemistry, photography, optics and cognate sciences.\r\nI shall therefore endeavour to limit myself generally to what an amateur\r\ncan see for himself with a small telescope, and can readily understand,\r\nrather than attempt to say a little something about everything, and fail\r\nin the effort.\r\n\r\nThe mean distance of the Earth from the Sun may be taken to be about 93\r\nmillions of miles, and this distance is employed by Astronomers as the\r\nunit by which most other long celestial distances are reckoned. The true\r\ndiameter of the Sun is about 866,000 miles. The surface area exceeds\r\nthat of the Earth 11,946 times, and the volume is 1,305,000 times\r\ngreater. The mass or weight of the Sun is 332,000 times that of the\r\nEarth, or about 700 times that of all the planets put together. Bulk for\r\nbulk the Sun is much lighter than the Earth: whilst a cubic foot of the\r\nEarth on an average weighs rather more than 5 times as much as a cubic\r\nfoot of water, a cubic foot of Sun is only about 3½ times the weight of\r\nthe same bulk of water. This consideration of the comparative lightness\r\nof the Sun (though in his day the Sun was thought to be lighter than it\r\nis now supposed to be) led Sir J. Herschel to infer that an intense heat\r\nprevails in its interior, independent it may be of its surface heat, so\r\nto speak, of which alone we are directly cognizant by the evidence of\r\nour senses.\r\n\r\nThe Sun is a sphere, and is surrounded by an extensive but attenuated\r\nenvelope, or rather series of envelopes, which taken together bear some\r\nanalogy to the atmosphere surrounding the Earth. These envelopes, which\r\nwe shall have to consider more in detail presently, throw out rays of\r\nlight and heat to the confines of the Solar System, though as to the\r\nconditions and circumstances under which that light and heat are\r\ngenerated we are entirely ignorant. Of the potency of the Sun’s rays we\r\ncan form but a feeble conception, for the amount received by the Earth\r\nis, it has been calculated, but one 2300-millionth of the whole. Our\r\nannual share would, it is supposed, be sufficient to melt a layer of ice\r\nspread uniformly over the Earth to a depth of 100 feet, or to heat an\r\nocean of fresh water 60 feet deep from freezing point to boiling point.\r\nThe illuminating power of the Sun has to be expressed in language of\r\nsimilar profundity. Thus it has been calculated to equal that which\r\nwould be afforded by 5563 wax candles concentrated at a distance of one\r\nfoot from the observer. Again, it has been concluded that no fewer than\r\nhalf a million of full moons shining all at once would be required to\r\nmake up a mass of light equal to that of the Sun. I present all these\r\nconclusions to the reader as they are furnished by various physicists\r\nwho have investigated such matters, but it is rather uncertain as to how\r\nmuch reliance can safely be placed on such calculations in detail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.—Ordinary Sun-spot, June 22, 1885.]\r\n\r\nTo an amateur possessed of a small telescope, the Sun offers (when the\r\nweather is above the English average of recent years) a very great and\r\nconstant variety of matters for studious scrutiny in its so-called\r\n“spots.” To the naked eye, or even on a hasty telescopic glance, the Sun\r\npresents the appearance of a uniform disc of yellowish white colour,\r\nthough often a little attention will soon result in the discovery of a\r\nfew, or it may be many, little black, or blackish patches, scattered\r\nhere and there over the disc seemingly without order or method. We shall\r\npresently find out, however, that this last-named suggestion is wholly\r\ninaccurate. Though commonly called “spots,” these dark appearances are\r\nnot simple spots, as the word might imply, for around the rather black\r\npatch which constitutes generally the main feature of the spot there is\r\nalmost invariably a fringe of paler tint; whilst within the confines of\r\nthe black patch which first catches the eye there is often a nucleus or\r\ninner portion of far more intense depth of shade. The innermost and\r\ndarkest portion being termed the _nucleus_, the ordinary black portion\r\nis known as _umbra_, whilst the encompassing fringe is the _penumbra_.\r\nIt is not always the case that each individual umbra has a penumbra all\r\nto itself, for several spots are occasionally included in one common\r\npenumbra. And it may further be remarked that cases of an umbra without\r\na penumbra and the contrary are on record, though these may be termed\r\nexceptional, often having relation to material organic changes either\r\njust commencing or just coming to a conclusion. A marked contrast\r\nsubsists in all cases between the luminosity of the penumbra and that of\r\nthe general surface of the Sun contiguous. Towards its exterior edge the\r\npenumbra is usually darker than at its inner edge, where it comes in\r\ncontact with the umbra. The outline of the penumbra is usually very\r\nirregular, but the umbra, especially in the larger spots, is often of\r\nregular form (comparatively speaking of course) and the nucleus (or\r\nnuclei) of the umbra still more noticeably partakes of a compactness of\r\noutline.\r\n\r\nSpots are for the most part confined to a zone extending 35° or so on\r\neach side of the solar equator; and they are neither permanent in their\r\nform nor stationary in their position. In their want of permanence, they\r\nare subject, apparently, to no definite laws, for they frequently appear\r\nand disappear with great suddenness.\r\n\r\nTheir motions are evidently of a two-fold nature; the Sun itself rotates\r\non its axis, and the spots collectively participate in this movement of\r\nrotation; but over and above this it has been conclusively proved that\r\nsometimes a spot has a proper motion of translation of its own\r\nindependently of the motion which it has in consequence of the Sun’s\r\naxial rotation. Curiously enough, spots are very rare immediately under\r\nthe Sun’s equator. It is in the zone extending from 8° to 20° North or\r\nSouth, as the case may be, that they are most abundant; or, to be more\r\nprecise still, their favourite latitude seems to be 17° or 18°. They are\r\noften more numerous and of a greater general size in the northern\r\nhemisphere, to which it may be added that the zone between 11° and 15°\r\nNorth is particularly noted for large and enduring spots. A gregarious\r\ntendency is often very obvious, and where the groups are very straggling\r\nan imaginary line joining the extreme ends of the group will generally\r\nbe found more or less parallel to the solar equator; and not only so,\r\nbut extending a long way, or sometimes almost entirely, across the whole\r\nof the visible disc. With respect to the foregoing matters Sir John\r\nHerschel remarked:—“These circumstances ... point evidently to physical\r\npeculiarities in certain parts of the Sun’s body more favourable than in\r\nothers to the production of the spots, on the one hand; and on the\r\nother, to a general influence of its rotation on its axis as a\r\ndetermining cause in their distribution and arrangement, and would\r\nappear indicative of a system of movements in the fluids which\r\nconstitute its luminous surface; bearing no remote analogy to our\r\ntrade-winds—from whatever cause arising.” More often than not when a\r\nmain spot has a train of minor spots as followers that train will be\r\nfound extending eastwards from the east side of the spot, rather than in\r\nany other direction.\r\n\r\nSpots remain visible for very diverse lengths of time, from the extreme\r\nof a few minutes up to a few months; but a few days up to, say, one\r\nmonth, may, in a general way, be suggested as their ordinary limits of\r\nendurance. As the Sun rotates on its axis in 25¼ days, and as the spots\r\nmay be said to be, practically speaking, fixed or nearly so with respect\r\nto the Sun’s body, no spot can remain continuously visible for more than\r\nabout 12½ days, being half the duration of the Sun’s axial rotation.\r\n\r\nWith regard to their size, spots vary as much as they do in their\r\nduration. The majority of them are telescopic, that is, are only visible\r\nwith the aid of a telescope; but instances are not uncommon of spots\r\nsufficiently large to be visible to the naked eye. The ancients knew\r\nnothing about the physical constitution of the Sun, and their few\r\nallusions to the subject were mere guesses of the wildest character.\r\nThey were, however, able to notice now and then that when the Sun was\r\nnear the horizon certain black spots could sometimes be distinguished\r\nwith the naked eye, but they took these for planets in conjunction with\r\nthe Sun, or phenomena of unknown origin. Earliest in point of date of\r\nthose who have left on record accounts of naked eye sun-spots are\r\nundoubtedly the Chinese. In a species of Cyclopædia ascribed to a\r\ncertain Ma-touan-lin (whose records of comets have been of the greatest\r\npossible use to astronomers), we find an account of 45 sun-spots seen\r\nduring a period of 904 years, from 301 A. D. to 1205 A. D. In order to\r\nconvey an idea of the relative size of the spots, the observers compared\r\nthem to eggs, dates, plums, etc., as the case might be. The observations\r\noften extended over several days; some indeed to as many as ten\r\nconsecutive days, and there seem no grounds for doubting the\r\nauthenticity of the observations thus handed down to us. A few stray\r\nobservations of sun-spots were recorded in Europe before the invention\r\nof the telescope. Adelmus, a Benedictine monk, makes mention of a black\r\nspot on the Sun on March 17, 807. It is also stated that such a spot was\r\nseen by Averröes in 1161. Kepler himself seems to have unconsciously\r\nonce seen a spot on the Sun with the naked eye, though he supposed he\r\nwas looking at a transit of the planet Mercury. None of these early\r\nobservers have told us the way in which they made their observations,\r\nbut the smallest of boys who has any claim to scientific knowledge is\r\naware of the fact, that by the use of so simple an expedient as a piece\r\nof glass blackened with smoke, spots which are of sufficient size can be\r\nseen with the naked eye. Before telescopes came into use it was\r\ncustomary to receive the solar rays in a dark chamber through a little\r\ncircular hole cut in a shutter. It was thus that J. Fabricius succeeded\r\nin December 1610 in seeing a considerable spot and following its\r\nmovement sufficiently well to enable him to determine roughly the period\r\nof the Sun’s rotation.\r\n\r\nThe spots may often be easily observed with telescopes of small\r\ndimensions, taking care, however, to place in front of the eye-piece a\r\npiece of strongly-coloured glass. For this purpose glasses of various\r\ncolours are used, but none so good as dark green or dark neutral tint.\r\nIt is not altogether easy to say positively how large a spot must be for\r\nit to be visible with the naked eye, or an opera glass, but probably it\r\nmay be taken generally that no spot of lesser diameter than 1′ of arc\r\ncan be so seen. This measurement must be deemed to apply to that central\r\nportion of a normal spot already mentioned as being what is called the\r\nnucleus, because penumbræ may be more than 1′ in diameter without being\r\nvisible to the naked eye, for the reason that their shading is so much\r\nless pronounced than the shading of umbræ. Very large and conspicuous\r\nspots are comparatively rare, though during the years 1893 and 1894\r\nthere were an unusual number of such spots. It often happens that a\r\nconspicuous group is the result of the merging or joining up of several\r\nsmaller groups. In such cases a group may extend over an area on the Sun\r\n3′ or 4′ of arc in length by 2′ or 3′ in breadth. The largest spot on\r\nrecord seems to have been one seen on September 30, 1858, the length of\r\nwhich in one direction amounted to more than 140,000 miles.\r\n\r\nThe observation of spots on the Sun by projecting them on to a white\r\npaper screen with the aid of a telescope is a method so convenient and\r\nso exact as to deserve a detailed description, the more so as it is so\r\nlittle used. Let there be made in the shutter of a darkened room a hole\r\nso much larger than the diameter of the telescope to be used as will\r\nallow a certain amount of play to the telescope tube, backwards and\r\nforwards, up and down, and from right to left. Direct the telescope to\r\nthe Sun and draw out the eye-piece to such a distance from the\r\nobject-glass as that the image projected on a white screen held behind\r\nmay be sharply defined at its edges. If there are any spots on the Sun\r\nat the time they will then be seen clearly exhibited on the screen. An\r\nimage obtained in this way is reversed as compared with the image seen\r\nby looking at the Sun through a telescope directly. If therefore the\r\ntelescope is armed with the ordinary astronomical eye-piece, which\r\ninverts, then the projection will be direct, that is to say, on the\r\nscreen the N. S. E. and W. points will correspond with the same\r\nterrestrial points. Under such circumstances the spots will be seen to\r\nenter the Sun’s disc on the E. side and to go off on the W. side. The\r\ncontrary condition of things would arise if a Galilean telescope or a\r\nterrestrial telescope of any kind were made use of. These instruments\r\nerect the image, and therefore will give by projection a reversed image,\r\nin which we shall see the spots moving apparently in a direction\r\ncontrary to their true direction.\r\n\r\nIf the reader has grasped the broad general outlines now given\r\nrespecting the Sun and its spots he will perhaps be interested to learn\r\na few further details, but these must be presented in a somewhat\r\ndisjointed fashion, because the multitude of facts on record concerning\r\nsun-spots are so great as to render a methodical treatment of them\r\nextremely difficult within the limits here imposed on me. These matters\r\nhave been gone into in a very exhaustive way by Secchi in his great\r\ntreatise on the Sun, and in what follows I have made much use of his\r\nobservations.\r\n\r\nLet us look a little further into the laws regulating the movement of\r\nthe spots. If it is not a question of seeing a spot spring into view,\r\nbut of watching one already in existence, we shall, in general, see such\r\na spot appear on the Eastern limb of the Sun just after having turned\r\nthe corner, so to speak. The spots traverse the Sun’s disc in lines\r\nwhich are apparently oblique with reference to the diurnal movement and\r\nthe plane of the ecliptic, and after about 13 days they will disappear\r\nat the Western limb if they have not done so before by reason of\r\nphysical changes in their condition. It is not uncommon for a spot after\r\nremaining invisible for 13 days on the other side of the Sun, so to\r\nspeak, to reappear on the Eastern limb and make a second passage across\r\nthe Sun; sometimes a third, and indeed sometimes even a fourth, passage\r\nmay be observed, but more generally they change their form and vanish\r\naltogether either before passing off the visible disc, or whilst they\r\nare on the opposite side as viewed from the Earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6.—Change of Form in Sun-spots owing to the Sun’s\r\nrotation.]\r\n\r\nWhen several spots appear simultaneously, they describe in the same\r\nperiod of time similar paths which are sensibly parallel to one another\r\nalthough they may be in very different latitudes. The conclusion from\r\nthis is inevitable, that spots are not bodies independent of the Sun, as\r\nsatellites would be, but that they are connected with the Sun’s surface,\r\nand are affected by its movement of rotation. If we make every day for a\r\nfew days in succession a drawing of the Sun’s disc with any spots that\r\nare visible duly marked thereon, we shall see that their apparent\r\nprogress is rapid near the centre of the Sun, but slow near either limb.\r\nThese differences, however, are apparent and not real, for their\r\nmovement appears to us to take place along a plane surface, whilst in\r\nreality it takes place along a circle parallel to the solar equator. The\r\nspots in approaching the Sun’s W. limb, if they happen to seem somewhat\r\ncircular in form when near the centre, first become oval, and then seem\r\nto contract almost into mere lines. These changes are simple effects of\r\nperspective, and are to be explained in the same manner as the apparent\r\ndecrease in the size of many of the spots is often explicable. But this\r\ncondition of things proves, however, that the spots belong to the actual\r\nsurface of the Sun, for, on a contrary supposition, we should have to\r\nregard them as circular bodies greatly flattened like lozenges, and this\r\nwould be contrary to all we know of the forms affected by the heavenly\r\nbodies. Of course besides the apparent changes of form just alluded to\r\nas the effect of perspective, it is abundantly certain that solar spots\r\noften undergo very real changes of form, not only from day to day, but\r\nin the course of a few hours. Several spots will often become\r\namalgamated into one, and it was ephemeral changes of this character\r\nwhich hindered generally the early observers from determining with\r\nprecision the duration of the Sun’s rotation.\r\n\r\nThe apparent movements of the spots vary also from month to month during\r\nthe year according to the season. In March their paths are very\r\nelongated ellipses with the convexity towards the N., the longer axis of\r\nthe ellipse being almost parallel to the ecliptic. After that epoch the\r\ncurvature of the ellipse diminishes gradually, at the same time that the\r\nmajor axis becomes inclined to the ecliptic, so that by June the\r\nflattening of the ellipse has proceeded so far that the path has become\r\na straight line. Between June and September the elliptical form\r\nreappears but in a reversed position; then, following these reversed\r\nphases, the ellipticity decreases, and for the second time there is an\r\nepoch of straight lines. This happens in December, but the straight\r\nlines are inclined in a converse direction to that which was the case in\r\nJune. It must again be impressed on the reader that all these seemingly\r\ndifferent forms of path pursued by the spots are merely effects of\r\nperspective, for in reality, the spots in crossing the Sun’s disc\r\ndescribe lines which are virtually parallel to the solar equator. These\r\nprojections really depend of course on the position of the observer on\r\nthe Earth, and vary as his position varies during the Earth’s annual\r\ncircuit round the Sun. The number of the spots varies through wide\r\nlimits. Sometimes they are so numerous that a single observation will\r\nenable us to recognise the position of the zones of maximum frequency.\r\nSometimes, on the other hand, they are so scarce, that many weeks may\r\npass away without hardly one being seen. A remarkable regularity is now\r\nrecognised in the succession of these periods of abundance and scarcity,\r\nas we shall see later on.\r\n\r\nIt is both useful and interesting in studying the spots to record\r\nmethodically their number and their size, but it is not easy to teach\r\nobservers how to do this so systematically that observations by one\r\nperson can be brought into comparison with those of another. Photography\r\nand hand-drawing on a screen alone furnish a trustworthy basis of\r\noperations. Spots in general may naturally be classified into (1)\r\nisolated spots or points, and (2) groups of spots; but often one\r\nobserver will describe as a small spot an object which another observer\r\nwould regard as a mere point; and one observer will record several\r\ngroups where another observer will see but one. A very few days’\r\nexperience with a telescope will bring home to the observer’s mind the\r\ndifficulty of dealing with the spots where it is a question of\r\nsystematic methodical observation of them.\r\n\r\nLet us now take a brief survey of some of the theories which have been\r\nput forth regarding the nature of the spots on the Sun. In the early\r\ndays of the telescope, that is to say, during the 17th century, two\r\ngeneral ideas were current. Some thought the spots to be shapeless\r\nsatellites revolving round the Sun; others that they were clouds, or\r\naggregations of smoke, floating about in a solar atmosphere. Scheiner,\r\nthe author of the first theory, abandoned it towards the close of his\r\nlife, having arrived at the conclusion that the spots were situated\r\nbelow the general level of the Sun’s surface. Another idea, but of later\r\ndate, was that the Sun is a liquid and incandescent mass of matter, and\r\nthe spots immense fragments of _Scoriæ_, or clinkers, floating upon an\r\nocean of fire.\r\n\r\nSomewhat more than a century after the spots had been generally studied\r\nwith the aid of a telescope a Scotchman named Wilson made a memorable\r\ndiscovery. He showed by the clearest evidence that they are cavities,\r\nand he propounded the first intelligible idea of the true physical\r\nconstitution of the Sun, when he compared to a strongly illuminated\r\ncloud the luminous layer of solar material which we now term the\r\n“photosphere.” On November 22, 1769, he observed on the Sun’s disc a\r\nfine round spot encompassed by a penumbra, also circular, and concentric\r\nwith the nucleus. He watched that spot up to the time that it\r\ndisappeared, and he soon remarked that the penumbra ceased to be\r\nsymmetrical: the part turned towards the centre of the Sun became\r\nsmaller and smaller, and eventually disappeared altogether; whilst the\r\npart on the opposite side preserved its fulness and dimensions almost\r\nunchanged. Let us suppose we chanced to turn a telescope on to the Sun\r\non a given day, and were fortunate enough to discover a spot in the\r\ncentre of the disc, with a penumbra concentric with the nucleus. When\r\nsuch a spot arrives about midway towards the limb, it will exhibit a\r\npenumbra narrower on the left side than on the right; later on the\r\npenumbra will disappear almost or quite completely on the left side:\r\nthen the nucleus itself will seem to be encroached upon. Finally, very\r\nnear the limb, there will remain only a slender thread of penumbra, and\r\nthe nucleus will have ceased to be directly visible. Such were the\r\nphases of transformation observed by Wilson and often studied since.\r\nWilson suspected that he had come upon some great law that was ripe for\r\ndisclosure, and in order not to be misled he waited for the return of\r\nthe same spot, which indeed reappeared on the Sun’s W. limb after about\r\n14 days. Then he found himself face to face with the same phases\r\nreproduced, but in the reverse order: the penumbra contracted on one\r\nside and full on the other, widening out on the contracted side as the\r\nspot came up to the Sun’s centre. Henceforth doubt was no longer\r\npossible; the spot had sensibly preserved the same shape during its\r\npassage, and the alterations noticed were only apparent, and resulted\r\nfrom an effect of perspective which was easy to be understood. The\r\ndifferent phases presented by such a spot as that just spoken of will be\r\nso much the more sensible according as the depth of the cavity is\r\ngreater; but if the depth is inconsiderable the bottom of the cavity\r\nwill only disappear when a very oblique angle is attained, and this\r\ncannot happen except when the spot is very near to the limb. By\r\nobservations carefully made under such circumstances it will be possible\r\nto determine the depth of the cavity, and Wilson found that the depth of\r\na spot often amounted to about one-third of the Earth’s radius. Wilson’s\r\ntheory was not accepted without dispute; it was contested by several\r\nastronomers, and in particular by Lalande. It was however taken up by\r\nSir W. Herschel, and as modified by him has met with general acceptance\r\ndown to the present time; though now and again challenged, perhaps most\r\nrecently and most vehemently by Howlett, a sun spot observer of great\r\nexperience. Wilson’s discovery was the point of departure for the grand\r\nlabours of Sir W. Herschel in the field of Solar Physics. Man of genius\r\nthat Herschel was, he was above all things an observer who took his own\r\nline in what he did. He saw so many phenomena with the powerful\r\ninstruments constructed by himself, he described so minutely the marvels\r\nwhich were revealed to him, that he left comparatively little for his\r\nsuccessors to do so far as regards mere telescopic observation.\r\nHerschel’s main idea as to the Sun was based on Wilson’s discovery. He\r\nremarked with reason, as that astronomer had done, that if the spots are\r\ncavities the luminous matter could neither be properly called liquid nor\r\ngaseous; for then it would precipitate itself with frightful rapidity to\r\nfill up the void, and that would render it impossible that the spots\r\nshould endure as we often see they do during several revolutions of the\r\nSun. Moreover, the proper movements of the spots prove that the\r\nphotosphere is not solid. We can therefore only liken it to fogs or\r\nclouds, and it must be suspended in an atmosphere similar to ours. Such\r\nis, according to Herschel, the only hypothesis which can explain the\r\nrapid changes which we witness. We shall see a little later on that\r\nthese phenomena do admit of another explanation.\r\n\r\nIn a second memoir Herschel followed up this inquiry with an acuteness\r\nworthy of his genius. Unfortunately he allowed himself to be carried\r\naway with the idea that the Sun was inhabited in order to sustain this\r\ntheory. He needed a solid kernel upon which his imaginary inhabitants\r\ncould dwell; and also a means whereby he could protect them from the\r\nradiations of the photosphere. With this idea in view he conjectured the\r\nexistence above the Sun’s solid body of a layer of clouds always\r\ncontiguous to the photosphere which enveloped it, and which always being\r\nrent when the photosphere was rent, thus enabled us to see the solid\r\nbody of the Sun lying behind. These notions can only be described as\r\nvery arbitrary, as unsupported by observation, and as involving\r\nexplanations quite out of harmony with the principles of modern physics.\r\nHowever, the labours of Herschel resulted in so many positive\r\ndiscoveries of visible facts, and in so many just conclusions, that they\r\ncontributed greatly to the growth of our present knowledge of the true\r\nconstitution of the Sun.\r\n\r\nSince Wilson’s time, as Secchi pointedly remarks, astronomers generally\r\nhave verified his observations with good instruments, and by an\r\ninvestigation of a great number of spots. De La Rue, discussing the Kew\r\nobservations, found that of 89 regular spots 72 gave results which\r\nconformed to Wilson’s ideas, whilst the remaining 17 were opposed\r\nthereto. There is nothing surprising in the existence of a contrarient\r\nminority when we consider the great changes which in reality often occur\r\nin the forms of the spots. De La Rue suggested a very simple expedient\r\nfor showing that the spots are cavities. Take two photographs of the Sun\r\nmade at an interval of one day: during that time every point on the\r\nSun’s surface will have been displaced, so far as the telescope is\r\nconcerned, by about 15°. Place these photographs in a stereoscope, and\r\nwe shall readily see the interior cavity, the edges of which will appear\r\nraised above the photosphere. It is impossible therefore to entertain\r\nthe least doubt as to the truth of the theory that the spots are\r\nexcavations in the luminous stratum which envelopes the whole of the\r\nsolar globe.\r\n\r\nIf it be true that a spot is a cavity, it follows that when it reaches\r\nthe margin of the solar disc we ought to detect a hollow place; and this\r\nwill be so much the more easy to observe according as the cavity is\r\nlarger and deeper. As a matter of fact, numerous observations of this\r\nsort have been recorded from the time of Cassini down to the present\r\ntime under the designation of “notches” on the Sun’s limb. On July 8,\r\n1873, Secchi observed such a notch 8″, or 3600 miles deep.\r\n\r\nFaye and some other astronomers are disposed to support a theory\r\naccording to which the spots are nothing else than aërial cyclones, but\r\nthis does not seem admissible. If the fundamental principle of a spot is\r\nthat it arises from a whirling movement, the rays (so to speak) which\r\ncompose the penumbræ must always be crooked, or the theory falls to the\r\nground. It is quite true that indications of cyclonic action do\r\nsometimes appear, but they are at any rate very rare, for only a small\r\npercentage exhibit in a distinct manner a spiral structure. Moreover,\r\nwhen such a structure is seen it does not endure for the whole lifetime\r\nof the spot but only for a day or two: the spot may last a long time\r\nafter it has lost its spiral features, if it ever had any. Sometimes\r\neven the whirling movement, after having slackened, begins again, but in\r\nthe contrary direction. Under these circumstances, though this\r\noccasional spiral structure is very curious and interesting, we are not\r\njustified in taking it as the basis of a theory which has any\r\npretensions to explain the general nature of sun-spots.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7.—Sun-spot seen as a Notch.]\r\n\r\nWhen we examine the Sun with instruments of large aperture and high\r\nmagnifying power, we notice that its surface is far from being as smooth\r\nand uniform as it appears in a small telescope. On the contrary, it\r\npresents an irregular undulating appearance like a pond or other sheet\r\nof water agitated by the wind. Careful scrutiny with a powerful\r\neye-piece reveals the fact that the Sun’s surface is marked by a\r\nmultitude of wrinkles and irregularities which it is well-nigh\r\nimpossible to describe in words. More or less everywhere there is a\r\ngeneral mottling visible; it is more distinct in some places than\r\nothers, and especially so towards the centre of the disc. This peculiar\r\nappearance varies very much from time to time, and its distinctness\r\nseems to depend a great deal on the state of the Earth’s atmosphere, for\r\nit becomes invisible when the air is disturbed; but these variations\r\ndepend also on real variations of the photosphere—a fact which\r\nobservations made in very calm weather are thought clearly to indicate.\r\n\r\nIt is often said that the Sun exhibits a granulated structure. If we\r\nwish to realise in the most precise manner what is meant by the word\r\n“granulation” as applied to the structure of the Sun, we must abandon\r\nthe method of projection and examine the Sun directly with a powerful\r\neyepiece, taking advantage of a moment when the atmosphere is perfectly\r\ncalm, and before the eyepiece has had time to get hot. It may then be\r\nseen that the Sun’s surface is covered with a multitude of little\r\ngrains, nearly all of about the same size, but of different shape,\r\nthough for the most part more or less oval. The small interstices which\r\nseparate these grains form a network which is dark without being\r\npositively black. Secchi considered it difficult to name any known\r\nobject which exactly answers in appearance to this structure, but he\r\nthought that we can find something resembling it in examining with a\r\nmicroscope milk which has been a little dried up, and the globules of\r\nwhich have lost their regular form. Exceptionally good atmospheric\r\nconditions are under all circumstances indispensable for the study of\r\nthese details.\r\n\r\nIn point of fact, there is a mysterious uncertainty about the normal\r\ncondition of the Sun’s surface, in a visual sense, which a few years ago\r\nengendered a very vehement controversy, and led to the use of such\r\nexpressions as “willow leaves,” “rice grains,” “sea beach,” and “straw\r\nthatching,” to indicate what was seen. All these words are too precise\r\nto be quite suitable to be taken literally, but perhaps, on the whole,\r\n“rice grains” is not altogether a bad expression to recall what\r\ncertainly seems to be the granular surface of the Sun as we see it.\r\n\r\nBy making use of moderate magnifying powers, what we see will often\r\nconvey the impression of a multitude of white points on a black network.\r\nThis is very apparent during the first few moments that the telescope is\r\nbrought to bear on the Sun, but its clearness quickly passes away\r\nbecause the eye gets fatigued, and the lenses becoming warm the air in\r\nthe telescope tube gets disturbed because also warmed. Sometimes the\r\nappearance is a little different from that just described, and along\r\nwith the white and brilliant points little black holes are intermixed.\r\nOftentimes the grains appear as if suspended in a black network and\r\nheaped together in knots more or less shaded and more or less broad.\r\nSometimes the grains exhibit a very elongated form, especially in the\r\nneighbourhood of the spots. It is these elongated forms to which Nasmyth\r\napplied the term “willow leaf,” whilst Huggins thought “rice grains” a\r\nvery suitable expression.\r\n\r\nThis granular or leaf-like structure—call it what we will—cannot be made\r\nout except with considerable optical assistance, for the grains being\r\nintrinsically very small, diffraction in enlarging them and causing them\r\nto encroach on one another necessarily produces a general confusion of\r\nimage. The real dimensions of these grains cannot therefore readily be\r\ndetermined by direct measurement, but by comparing them with the wires\r\nused in micrometer eye-pieces it has been thought that their diameters\r\nmay usually be regarded as equal to ¼ or ⅓ of a second—say from 120 to\r\n150 miles. The granules seem to be possessed of sensible movement, but\r\npresumably it is not always or even generally a movement of translation\r\nfrom place to place; only an undulatory movement like that of still\r\nwater when a stone is cast into it. Nevertheless, probably in certain\r\ncases the granules actually are affected by a motion of translation, for\r\nin the vicinity of spots they may sometimes be seen flowing over the\r\nedges of the penumbræ. In order to explain the existence of the granules\r\nthe strangest theories have been broached. Sir William Herschel having\r\nobserved the granulations, applied to them the term “corrugations” or\r\n“furrows”—words somewhat inexact, perhaps, but by which, as his\r\ndescriptions clearly show, he meant to designate the features which I am\r\nnow treating of. He even noticed the dark network which separates the\r\ngrains, and he applied to it the word “indentations.”\r\n\r\nThese granulations are without doubt prominences, probably of hydrogen\r\ngas, which rise above the general surface, for this structure is much\r\nmore sharp and distinct at the centre of the sun’s disc than at the\r\nlimbs; that is to say, near the limbs of the Sun they partially overlap\r\none another, as indeed Herschel remarked. The idea of flames would\r\nsatisfy these appearances: and as the spectroscope suggests to us that\r\nthe Sun is habitually covered over with a multitude of little jets of\r\nflame, the observations which have been made compel the opinion that the\r\ngrains are the summits of those prominences which exist all over the\r\nSun’s surface.\r\n\r\nThe surface is sometimes so thickly covered over with these\r\ngranulations—the network is so conspicuous—that we can readily imagine\r\nthat we see everywhere pores and the beginnings of spots, but this\r\naspect is not permanent, and seems to depend to some extent on\r\natmospheric causes combined also with actual changes in the Sun’s\r\nsurface itself. There seems however no doubt that the joints, so to\r\nspeak, of the dark network already referred to do sometimes burst\r\nasunder and develope into spots.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances which accompany the formation of a spot cannot readily\r\nbe specified with certainty. It is impossible to say that there exists\r\nany law as to this matter. Whilst some spots develope very slowly by the\r\nexpansion of certain pores, others spring into existence quite suddenly.\r\nYet it cannot be said that the formation of a spot is ever completely\r\ninstantaneous however rapid it may be. The phenomenon is often announced\r\nsome days in advance: we may perceive in the photosphere a great\r\nagitation which often manifests itself by some very brilliant _faculæ_\r\n(to be described presently) giving birth to one or more pores. Very\r\noften we next notice some groups of little black spots, as if the\r\nluminous stratum was becoming thinner in such a way as to disappear\r\nlittle by little and leave a large black nucleus uncovered. At the\r\ncommencement of the business there is usually no clearly defined\r\npenumbra. This developes itself gradually and acquires a regular\r\noutline, just as the spot itself often takes a somewhat circular form.\r\nThis tranquil and peaceable formation of a spot only happens at a time\r\nwhen calm seems to reign in the solar atmosphere: in general the\r\ndevelopment is more tumultuous and the stages more complicated.\r\n\r\nAs a rule a spot passes through three stages of existence:—(1) the\r\nPeriod of birth; (2) a Period of calm; and (3) the Period of\r\ndissolution. When a spot is on the point of closing up, the flow of the\r\nluminous matter which it, as it were, attracts, is not directed\r\nuniformly towards the centre; it seems that the photospheric masses, no\r\nlonger meeting with resistance, are precipitated promiscuously anywhere\r\nso as to fill up the hole. It is impossible to describe in detail the\r\nphases which irregular spots go through, but two things may always be\r\nremarked: that their structure is characterized by the existence of\r\nluminous filaments, and that these filaments converge towards one or\r\nseveral centres.\r\n\r\nSecchi thus sums up certain conclusions which he arrived at relating to\r\nspots generally:—(1) It is not on the surface of any solid body that the\r\nsolar spots are manifested; they are produced in a fluid mass, the\r\nfluidity of which is represented by a gas, so that the constitution of\r\nthis medium may be likened to that of flames or clouds; (2) the known\r\ndetails respecting the constitution of the penumbra and the phenomena\r\nexhibited prove that the penumbra is not a mass of obscure matter which\r\nfloats across luminous matter, but that it is on the contrary a case of\r\nluminous matter invading and floating about over darker materials and so\r\nproducing a half tint.\r\n\r\nAll the available evidence which we possess may be said to show that the\r\nspots are not merely superficial appearances, but that they have their\r\norigin deep in the interior of the Sun, and are produced by the\r\noperation of causes still unknown to us which affect and disturb the\r\nSun’s mass to an extent which is sometimes very considerable. The spots\r\nthen are only the results of a great agitation in the materials of which\r\nthe Sun is composed, and this agitation extends far down below the\r\nlimits of the visible dark nucleus whatever that may consist of.\r\n\r\nBesides the spots, streaks of light may frequently be remarked upon the\r\nsurface of the Sun towards the margin of the disc. These are termed\r\n_faculæ_ (torches), and they are often found near the spots, or where\r\nspots have previously existed or have afterwards appeared. When quite\r\nnear the Sun’s limb these faculæ are usually more or less parallel to\r\nthe limb. They are of irregular form and may be likened to certain kinds\r\nof coral. They generally appear to be more luminous than the solar\r\nsurface immediately adjacent to them, but it is not improbable that this\r\nis an optical illusion depending upon the fact that the edges of the Sun\r\nalways appear much more luminous than the centre. This last-named fact\r\nmay be readily recognised by the employment of a high magnifying power,\r\nand moving the telescope rapidly from the limb to the centre of the\r\ndisc. If the Sun be projected on a screen, as already mentioned, this\r\ndegradation of the Sun’s light from centre to circumference becomes\r\nparticularly manifest.\r\n\r\nAfter having studied the structure and the movement of the spots, one is\r\nnaturally led to ask if their apparitions at different periods are\r\nsubject to any general law. This question is one which has much engaged\r\nthe attention of modern astronomers. The older observers noticed that\r\nthe number of the spots visible differed in different years. There were\r\nsaid to have been periods when months and even years passed away without\r\nany spots being observed. Even allowing that this statement, so far as\r\n“years” are concerned, might be exaggerated, and that the absence of\r\nspots was due to the want of sufficient care in making the observations,\r\nand especially to the want of efficient instruments, it is none the less\r\ntrue that the number of the spots is extremely variable, and that there\r\nhave been epochs when they were very scarce.\r\n\r\nSir W. Herschel was the first who devoted himself to the question of\r\nseeking to establish a relation between the variation of the spots and\r\nterrestrial meteorology. For the want of any better object, he compared\r\nthe annual number of the spots with the price of wheat; but it is easy\r\nto see that nothing could result from such a comparison. Without doubt\r\nthe meteorological phenomena of the globe must depend to some extent on\r\nsolar changes: but the term of comparison selected by Herschel had no\r\ndirect bearing on the state of the Sun.\r\n\r\nIn our time this question has been investigated to its very foundation\r\nby Wolf, Director for many years at the Observatory of Zurich. It is to\r\nhis zeal that we owe a very interesting assemblage of old observations\r\nwhich were buried in archives and chronicles. It was he who endeavoured\r\nto reduce them into a systematic form, so as to supply as far as\r\npossible the numerous gaps which exist in the different series.\r\n\r\nThe two most attentive observers at the period when the spots were\r\ndiscovered were Marriott at Oxford and Scheiner at Ingoldstadt, but\r\nScheiner himself has informed us that he did not note down all the spots\r\nwhich he saw; he only recorded those which were likely to assist him in\r\nhis special task of determining the period of the Sun’s rotation.\r\nSeveral observers after him made isolated series of observations; but\r\nsome of these have been lost and the others show important gaps. J. G.\r\nStaudacher, at Nuremburg, observed the Sun with great perseverance\r\nduring fifty years from 1749 to 1799. Before him the Cassinis, Maraldi,\r\nand others were engaged in the same sort of work, but only in an\r\nindirect way: that is to say, they contented themselves, whilst making\r\nmeridional observations of the Sun, with noting anything in the way of\r\nspots which they deemed important. Zucconi and Flaugergues also left\r\nbehind them a good collection of observations which Wolf utilised,\r\nrendering them comparable one with another by applying suitable\r\ncorrections. The great difficulty herein arises from the fact that the\r\nobservers were not provided with instruments of equal power; one man,\r\narmed with a better telescope than his contemporaries, naturally\r\nobserved and recorded spots which would escape the others. The numbers\r\nentered in their registers are therefore not comparable _inter se_. Wolf\r\nendeavoured to replace these numbers by others which would represent the\r\nspots which might have been seen if the observers had all employed\r\ntelescopes of a given kind and power. The result of his efforts in this\r\ndirection is an almost continuous series of Sun-spot records from an\r\nepoch sufficiently remote, up to the time when this branch of science\r\nwas taken up with the vigour of modern scientific methods.\r\n\r\nThe observer who most assiduously devoted himself to this subject in\r\nmodern times was Schwabe of Dessau. From 1826 to 1868 he never failed to\r\nmake daily observations when the weather permitted him. His series of\r\nrecords is specially valuable, for Carrington’s fits in with it, and\r\nwith that in turn Spörer’s is comparable, and the chain is complete by\r\nthe later photographic and other observations. All these Sun-spot\r\nrecords, though differing in their details, may easily be used together\r\nwhen it is a question of working out relative annual fluctuations.\r\n\r\nAt the present time there are many Astronomers who are engaged in\r\nobserving the spots with care; but just as formerly there are few who\r\npossess sufficient perseverance. The photographic method is excellent,\r\nbut it takes much time and is costly. Some have decried, in a very\r\nunreasonable manner, a drawing made by hand: such a drawing, of\r\nsufficient size, and executed by projection by a skilful draughtsman\r\nwith a telescope driven by clockwork, may stand comparison with a\r\nphotograph, and this method has a better chance of being persevered in.\r\nThe Rev. F. Howlett’s name must be mentioned in this connection as a\r\ndraughtsman who has accomplished much by hand drawing. Though the once\r\nfamous Kew observations have been discontinued, they have been replaced\r\nby a new series at Greenwich with similar appliances; whilst Janssen at\r\nMeudon has also been carrying on for a number of years a splendid course\r\nof photographic records.\r\n\r\nSchwabe, when he had collected a considerable number of observations,\r\nrecognised clear indications of periodicity. Very definite epochs of\r\nmaxima and minima succeeded one another at intervals of 10 or 11 years.\r\nIt is true that in following out such a study the observations are\r\ncertain to be in a sense a little defective. At first it was not\r\npossible to observe the Sun every day, and the gaps which resulted from\r\nbad weather necessarily added to the number of days which had to be set\r\ndown as being without spots. Moreover, every method of numbering the\r\nspots must be a little arbitrary: there are often groups which, in\r\nconsequence of their sub-divisions, may be counted in different ways:\r\nbut in a mass of observations so considerable as those of Schwabe’s,\r\nsuch uncertainties will compensate for one another and will disappear in\r\nthe final result. In fact the law is so striking that it suffices to\r\ncast one’s eye over his table[2] to see that.\r\n\r\nThat table is both interesting and instructive at the same time. The\r\nnumbers exhibited in it speak for themselves, and it is sufficient to\r\nexamine them with even a small amount of attention to realise the\r\ncertainty of the conclusions which have been drawn.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore now to be deemed an ascertained fact that there are\r\nperiodical maxima and minima in the display of spots, and that the\r\nextent of the period is between 10 and 12 years. In order to determine\r\nthis value with the utmost exactness, some astronomers have had recourse\r\nto early observations. Wolf of Zurich made this the subject of some very\r\ninteresting inquiries. He was able to establish the chronology of the\r\nphases which the Sun has passed through from the time of the first\r\ndiscovery of the spots to the present day—more than 2½ centuries. His\r\ncalculations led him to a period of 11-1/9 years. Lamont fixed upon\r\n10.43 years, but this number does not represent the more recent\r\nobservations with sufficient precision.\r\n\r\nIn order to exhibit this law in the plainest possible manner the dates\r\nof maxima and minima should be laid down on ruled paper in proper\r\nmathematical form, the _abscissæ_ of the curve representing the years,\r\nand the _ordinates_ the number of spots observed.\r\n\r\nAn examination of a curve thus plotted shows two things:—(1) That the\r\nperiod is clearly an eleven-year one, as has been already stated; (2)\r\nthat it is not however quite as simple in its form as it was at first\r\nthought to be; for in reality there are two periods superposed, the one\r\nrather more than half a century long, and the other extending over the\r\n11 years already spoken of. We do not possess early observations\r\nsufficiently numerous and sufficiently good to enable us to draw any\r\nunimpeachable conclusions as to the nature of the long period; we can\r\nonly be certain that it exists. The later labours of Wolf, however,\r\nfixed that period at 55½ years. It is a result of this that, according\r\nto Loomis, a period of comparative calm on the Sun existed between 1810\r\nand 1825.\r\n\r\nEach maximum lies nearer to the minimum which precedes it than to the\r\nminimum which follows it, for the spots increase during 3.7 years, and\r\nthen diminish during 7.4 years. According to De La Rue the increase\r\noccupies 3.52 years, and diminution 7.55 years. This concurrence between\r\nDe La Rue and Wolf is surprising considering the diversity of the\r\nmethods which led to results almost identical, the one set being based\r\non the number of the spots, and the other on the superficial extent of\r\nthe spots. The different periods in succession are not absolutely\r\nidentical: but it has been remarked that if during any one period the\r\ndecrease is retarded or accelerated, then the increase next following\r\nwill be lengthened or contracted to a corresponding extent. In\r\nconsequence of this we are sometimes able to predict with fair accuracy\r\nwhen the next ensuing maximum or minimum will take place.\r\n\r\nThe most striking feature of such a curve as that just alluded to is the\r\nvery sensible secondary augmentation which happens very soon after the\r\nprincipal maximum.\r\n\r\nA very curious circumstance has come to light in connection with the\r\nepochs of maxima and minima. In arranging the spots according to their\r\nlatitude and longitude on a diagram sufficiently contracted, Carrington\r\nfound that their latitude decreases gradually as the period of minimum\r\ndraws near; then when their number begins to increase they begin to\r\nappear again at a higher latitude. This seems to be a definite law. At\r\nany rate Carrington’s conclusion has been found to hold good by the\r\nobservations of Spörer and Secchi.\r\n\r\nThe variations of the spots which we now recognise naturally recall\r\nthose obscurations of the Sun which are recorded in history; but it is\r\nnecessary to accept many of these with caution. A great number of these\r\nphenomena which attracted the attention of people in early times are\r\nonly eclipses badly observed and still more badly described. In other\r\ninstances the obscuration has been produced by very protracted dry fogs.\r\nIt is probably to this last-named cause that we must ascribe the\r\nobscuration which, according to Kepler and Gemma Frisius, took place in\r\n1547.\r\n\r\nIt was in some such way as this that, according to Virgil (Georg. i,\r\n630), who has echoed a tradition which he found in history, the Sun was\r\nobscured at the death of Cæsar:—\r\n\r\n  Ille etiam extincto miseratus Cæsare Romam\r\n  Quum caput obscura nitidum ferrugine texit,\r\n  Impiaque æternam timuerunt sæcula noctem.\r\n\r\nIn the year 553 A.D., and again in the year 626 A.D. the Sun remained\r\nobscured for several months; but these facts (if facts they are) besides\r\nbeing ill-observed, and clothed, no doubt, in extremely exaggerated\r\nlanguage, are brought to our notice as having occurred at epochs which\r\nare quite independent of one another, whilst the variations in the\r\nmarkings on the Sun, which we have just been talking about, present an\r\nalmost mathematical regularity of sequence.\r\n\r\nWe must now institute some inquiries as to the causes of the periodicity\r\nof the spots. A periodicity so well established would naturally invite\r\nastronomers to seek the causes which produced it. The presence of spots\r\nonly in the Zodiacal regions led Galileo to suspect the existence of\r\nsome relation between the spots and the position of the planets; but\r\nthere is in this a mere surmise, which, when it was made, had nothing to\r\njustify it, and it is still impossible for us to say anything for\r\ncertain on the point. The determining cause of the periodicity may exist\r\nin the interior of the Sun, and may depend on circumstances which will\r\nfor ever remain unknown to us. Or it may be something external: it may\r\nbe due after all to the influence of the planets. It remains for us,\r\ntherefore, to search and see if any such influence can be traced.\r\n\r\nAccording to Wolf, the attraction of the planets, or of some of them, is\r\nthe real cause of the periodicity which we are dealing with; that\r\nattraction producing on the surface of the solar globe true tides, which\r\ngive birth to the spots, these tides themselves experiencing periodic\r\nvariations owing to the periodic changes of position of the celestial\r\nbodies which cause them. It has even been thought safe to assert that\r\nthe fact of the principal period coinciding with the revolution of\r\nJupiter is of momentous significance; but this coincidence seems purely\r\naccidental, and no certain conclusion can be drawn as to this matter.\r\nThe influence of Mercury and Venus would perhaps be much more potent,\r\nfor their distance from the Sun is not very great, and this should\r\nrender their influence more sensible. On the other hand, their masses\r\nappear to be too small to be capable of producing any sufficient effect.\r\n\r\nDe La Rue, Balfour Stewart, and Löwy most perseveringly studied this\r\npoint of solar physics. They seem to have arrived at the conclusion that\r\nthe conjunctions of Venus and Jupiter do exercise a certain amount of\r\ninfluence on the number of the spots and on their latitude; and that\r\nthis influence is less considerable when Venus is situated in the plane\r\nof the solar equator. At any rate it is a fact, that a great number of\r\nthe visible inequalities in a duly plotted curve of the spots do really\r\ncorrespond to special positions of these two planets.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine with more precision these coincidences and the\r\nimportance which attaches to them, De La Rue extended his inquiries. He\r\nseparately analysed many different groups of spots, selecting for his\r\npurpose more particularly those of which the observations happened to\r\nhave been specially continuous and complete, giving a preference\r\nmoreover to those which had been observed in the central portions of the\r\nSun’s disc. From an investigation of 794 groups De La Rue arrived at the\r\nfollowing conclusions:—(1) If we take a meridian passing through the\r\nmiddle of the disc and represented by a diameter perpendicular to the\r\nequator, we find that the mean size of the spots is not the same with\r\nregard to that meridian. It appears certain that the correction required\r\nfor perspective does not suffice to explain this difference; and that\r\nanother element must be introduced in order to secure that the apparent\r\ndimensions of the spots may be the same on both sides. We do not yet\r\npossess a very clear explanation of this fact; but the most probable is\r\nthis:—the spots are surrounded by a projecting bank, which seems to\r\ndisappear in part during their transit across the Sun. This bank is more\r\nelevated on the preceding than on the following side; accordingly, the\r\nspots ought to seem smaller when they are in the eastern half of the\r\ndisc; larger when they are in the western half; for in the first\r\nposition the observer’s eye meets an elevated obstacle, which hides a\r\nportion of the spot itself. (2) De La Rue specially studied the spots\r\nobserved at the times when the planets Venus and Mars were at a\r\nheliocentric distance from the Earth equal to 0, 90, 180, and 270\r\ndegrees, and arrived at this result; the spots are larger in the part of\r\nthe Sun which is away from Venus and Mars, and they are smaller on the\r\nside on which these planets happen to be. The same result was obtained,\r\nwhether Carrington’s figures or the Kew photographs were employed. (3)\r\nMeanwhile it does not appear that Jupiter emits any similar influence.\r\nThis influence should be easily perceived, for if we calculate the\r\naction of the planets in the way that we calculate the tides, treating\r\nit as directly proportional to the masses and inversely proportional to\r\nthe cubes of the distances, the influence of Jupiter should greatly\r\noutweigh that of Venus.\r\n\r\nWolf thought that he had noticed traces of some influence being exerted\r\nby Saturn; but this remains altogether without confirmation.\r\n\r\nDe La Rue noticed that large spots are generally situated at extremities\r\nof the same diameter. This law also often applies to the development of\r\nlarge prominences. The coincidence agrees well with the theory that\r\nthere exists on the Sun some action resembling that of our tides.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the amount of probability which attaches to these\r\nexplanations we ought not to forget that we are still far off from\r\npossessing the power of giving a vigorous demonstration of them. If we\r\nconsider with attention the periodical variations of the spots we shall\r\nnot be long in coming to the conclusion that it is impossible to connect\r\nthem directly with any one astronomical function in particular, for the\r\nspots appear in a sudden and irregular manner which contrasts in a\r\nstriking degree with the continuous and progressive action of the\r\nordinary perturbations which we meet with in the study of Celestial\r\nMechanics. There is but one reply possible to this objection. The spots\r\nand their changes must be visible manifestations of the periodical\r\nactivity of the Sun—an activity which itself depends (as assumed) on the\r\naction of the planets and on their relative positions. The cause, thus\r\ndefined, of the Sun’s activity may be very regular; the activity itself\r\nmay vary in a continuous manner without the resulting phenomena\r\npossessing the same continuity and the same regularity. We see this in\r\nthe periodical succession of the Seasons on the Earth. The position of\r\nthe Sun, and consequently its manner of acting upon our globe, varies\r\nwith a remarkable uniformity, but nevertheless the meteorological\r\nphenomena which result are irregular and capricious. Thus it comes about\r\nthat physicists are more and more inclined to believe that the spots are\r\nonly secondary effects produced by causes more important and more\r\nfundamental.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be our ignorance as to the causes which produce variations\r\nin the Sun’s activity we may at least draw one conclusion from the\r\npreceding remarks: it is, that the Sun is a very long way from having\r\narrived at a state of tranquillity and freedom from internal commotion.\r\nOn the contrary, it is the seat of great movements. Its activity is\r\nsubject to numberless periodical changes which ought in their turn to\r\ninfluence the intensity of the heat and light given out by the Sun; and\r\nso re-act on the planets which receive their heat, light, and life from\r\nthe Sun.\r\n\r\nNo account of the periodicity of the spots on the Sun can be deemed\r\ncomplete which does not include information respecting certain other\r\nperiodical phenomena which have been found to exhibit features of\r\nalternation closely resembling in their sequence and character the\r\nperiodical changes which take place in regard to the spots on the Sun.\r\nThere is evidently a deep mystery lying hid under the curious fact\r\n(which is clearly established) that the 11-year period of the spots\r\ncoincides in a manner as unexpected as it is certain with the period of\r\nthe variation of terrestrial magnetism. The magnetic needle is subject\r\nto a diurnal variation which reaches its extreme amount every 11 years,\r\nand not only so, but the epoch of maximum variation corresponds with the\r\nepoch of the maximum prevalence of Sun spots. And similarly years in\r\nwhich the needle is least disturbed are also years in which the Sun\r\nspots are fewest. Two other very curious discoveries have also been made\r\nwhich are in evident close connection with the foregoing. The\r\nmanifestation of the Aurora Borealis and of those strange currents of\r\nelectricity known as magnetic earth currents (which travel below the\r\nEarth’s surface and frequently interfere with telegraphic operations),\r\nlikewise exhibit periodical changes which take 11 years to go through\r\nall their stages. This fact alone would be sufficiently curious, but\r\nwhen we come to find that the curve which exhibits the changes these two\r\nmanifestations of force go through, also shows that their maxima and\r\nminima are contemporaneous with the maxima and minima of the Sun spots\r\nand magnetic needle variations, we cannot doubt that (to use Balfour\r\nStewart’s words) “a bond of union exists between these four phenomena.\r\nThe question next arises, what is the nature of this bond? Now, with\r\nrespect to that which connects Sun spots with magnetic disturbances we\r\ncan as yet form no conjecture.” To cut a long story short, it may be\r\nsaid generally that whilst without doubt electricity is the common basis\r\nof the three last-named of the four phenomena just mentioned, it seems\r\nscarcely too great a stretch of the imagination to go one step further\r\nand suggest that electricity has in some or other occult manner\r\nsomething to do with all these things and therefore with the spots on\r\nthe Sun.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 8.—The Sun totally eclipsed, July 18, 1860\r\n(Feilitzsch).]\r\n\r\nThe reader who has followed me thus far will by this time be in a\r\nposition to appreciate a remark made in an earlier part of this chapter,\r\nthat the multitude of facts known to us in connection with the Sun and\r\nits spots is so great, as to render it impossible to exhibit in a single\r\nchapter anything more than the barest outline of them. The numerous\r\nobservations of recent eclipses of the Sun, especially since that of\r\n1860, and the extensive application of the spectroscope to the Sun both\r\nin connection with these eclipses, and generally, may be said to have\r\ncompletely revolutionised our knowledge of solar phenomena during the\r\npresent generation; or perhaps it might be more correct to say have\r\nenormously increased our knowledge of the facts of the case and have\r\nrevolutionised in no small degree the conclusions deduced from the\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n                                MERCURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo far as we know at present, Mercury is the nearest planet to the Sun.\r\nThe circumstances under which it presents itself to us and a brief\r\ngeneral account of its movements have already been stated. In the\r\npresent chapter, therefore (and this remark applies in substance to each\r\nof the succeeding chapters appropriated to particular planets), I shall\r\nlimit myself to such topics as seem to be of interest to an observer\r\narmed with a telescope. Mercury, as already mentioned, exhibits from\r\ntime to time phases which may be said to be the same as those of the\r\nmoon; but as the only chance of seeing it is when it is at its greatest\r\ndistance east or west of the Sun, practically it can only be studied\r\nwhen in, or rather near to, what may be called the half-moon phase; and\r\neven then observations on its physical appearance can only be obtained\r\nwith difficulty. Perhaps its most definite feature is its colour. This,\r\nundoubtedly, is more or less pink. Strange to say, in spite of the\r\nmultiplication of telescopes and observers, comparatively little\r\nattention has been paid to this planet, and we really know very little\r\nmore about it than Schröter told us nearly a hundred years ago. He\r\nobtained what he conceived to be satisfactory evidence of the existence\r\nof at any rate one mountain, having a height of about 11 English miles—a\r\nheight which it will be noted, far exceeds, not only relatively but\r\nabsolutely, any mountain on the earth. What Schröter based this\r\nconclusion upon was the fact that when the planet was near inferior\r\nconjunction, the southern horn presented a truncated appearance, which\r\nmight be the result of a lofty projection arresting the Sun’s light.\r\nSchröter also announced that Mercury rotated on its axis in 24 hours 5\r\nminutes. Sir W. Herschel failed to satisfy himself that Schröter’s\r\nconclusions were well-founded, but it must certainly be admitted that\r\nsome support for them is furnished by certain observations made within\r\nthe last few years. It is matter for regret, however, that most of these\r\nwere made with instruments of sizes which, for the most part, cannot be\r\nsaid to have been equal to the task to which they were applied. The\r\ntruncature of the southern horn first spoken of by Schröter, was thought\r\nby Denning, in 1882, to be obvious; and in the same year, by watching\r\nthe displacement of certain bright and dusky spaces on the disc, the\r\nsame observer concluded that a rotation period of about 25 hours was\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\nIn 1882 Schiaparelli at Milan commenced a prolonged study of Mercury.\r\nBelieving that it was essential to observe through a good condition of\r\natmosphere, and that this was impossible if the planet were only looked\r\nat in twilight, when it was necessarily at a low altitude, Schiaparelli\r\nmade all his observations with the Sun and planet high up in the\r\nheavens. He considered, in effect, that the blaze of the Sun’s light was\r\na lesser evil than the tremors inseparable from observations of the\r\nplanet, clear it might be in some degree of inconvenient Sun-light, but\r\nviewed through the vapours and atmospheric disturbances, which always\r\nspoil all observations near the horizon. Schiaparelli’s observations\r\nyielded various results, most of them novel, and one of them very\r\nstartling. He considers Mercury to be a much spotted globe and to be\r\nenveloped in a tolerably dense atmosphere. He thought he noticed\r\nbrownish stripes and streaks (which might be regarded as permanent\r\nmarkings), more clearly visible on some occasions than on others; and\r\nthat these systematically disappeared near the limb, owing to the\r\nincreased depth there of the atmosphere through which they had to be\r\nlooked at.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing observations may be regarded as not unreasonable; they may\r\neven be accepted without further question. But what are we to say to\r\nSchiaparelli’s conclusions that these markings are so nearly permanent,\r\ntaking one day with another, that Mercury’s rotation cannot be measured\r\nin hours at all, but is a matter of days,—in point of fact, of 88 days;\r\nand that in reality Mercury occupies in its rotation on its axis the\r\nwhole of the 88 days which constitute its sidereal year, or period of\r\nrevolution round the Sun. The counterpart of this for us would be that,\r\ninstead of the inhabitants of the earth having a day of 24 hours, they\r\nwould have only one day and night every 365 days. Astronomers are not at\r\npresent satisfied to accept this conclusion in regard to Mercury.\r\n\r\nSome observers have thought that Mercury is more easy to observe than\r\nVenus, and that, speaking generally, its surface, if we could only get\r\nto see it constantly under favourable circumstances, might be considered\r\nto resemble in most respects that of Mars. Mercury revolves round the\r\nSun at a mean distance of 36 millions of miles. Owing, however, to the\r\nfact that the eccentricity of its orbit (or its departure from the\r\ncircular form) is greater than that of any of the other major planets,\r\nit may approach to within 28½ millions of miles or recede to more than\r\n43 millions of miles. Its apparent diameter varies between 4½″ in\r\nsuperior conjunction to 13″ in inferior conjunction. The real diameter\r\nmay be taken at about 3000 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n                                 VENUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe planet Venus has two things in common with Mercury. One is, that\r\nbeing an inferior planet, that is to say, a planet revolving round the\r\nSun in an orbit within that of the Earth, it is never very far distant\r\nfrom the Sun, and therefore can never be seen on a distinctly dark sky.\r\nThe second point alluded to arises out of the first; Venus exhibits from\r\ntime to time a series of phases which are identical in character with\r\nthose of Mercury, and therefore with those of the Moon. Venus differs,\r\nhowever, from Mercury in the very important point of size. Inasmuch as\r\nits diameter is considerably more than double the diameter of Mercury it\r\nhas a surface more than six times as great, and therefore exhibits a far\r\nlarger area of illumination than Mercury does. The result of this\r\n(coupled with another fact which will be stated presently) is that the\r\nplanet may often be easily seen in broad daylight, and sometimes casts a\r\nsensible shadow at night. Under special circumstances, which recur every\r\n8 years, this planet shines with very peculiar brilliancy. True, that\r\nonly about ¼th of the whole disc is then illuminated, but that fraction\r\ntransmits to us more light than phases of greater extent do, because\r\nthese latter coincide with epochs when the planet is more remote from\r\nthe Earth.\r\n\r\nSpots and shadings have on various occasions been noticed on Venus, and\r\nthough it is not easy to harmonise the various accounts, there seems no\r\ndoubt of the reality of the facts, or that they must be ascribed to the\r\nexistence of mountains. Schröter found very much the same state of\r\nthings to exist on Venus that he found on Mercury, and putting together\r\nwhat he saw he arrived at the conclusion that Venus possesses mountains\r\nof considerable height, and that his observations must be taken to imply\r\nthat the planet revolved on its axis in rather more than 23 hours. This\r\nconclusion as regards the planet’s axial rotation was not first arrived\r\nat by Schröter, for the two Cassinis, one about 1666, and the other\r\nabout 1740, both ascribed to Venus a rotation period of about 23 hours,\r\nan evaluation which was fully confirmed by Di Vico at Rome between 1839\r\nand 1841, and by Flammarion in 1894.\r\n\r\nWhat has been already said with respect to Mercury is true also of\r\nVenus, namely that it has been much neglected by modern observers; and\r\naccordingly an announcement made by Schiaparelli in 1890, that the\r\nrotation period of Venus is to be measured not by hours but by months,\r\ncame upon the astronomical world as a startling revelation; but it is a\r\nrevelation which has been keenly contested, and certainly awaits legal\r\nproof. Schiaparelli has not ventured to assert as he has done in the\r\ncase of Mercury, that Venus’s rotation period is identical with the\r\nperiod of 7½ months in which it revolves round the Sun; he only claims\r\nthis as a strong probability arising out of what he says he is certain\r\nof, namely that its period of rotation cannot be less than six months\r\nand may be as much as nine months. His assumption is that previous\r\nobservers in endeavouring to ascertain Venus’s rotation period have used\r\nand relied upon evanescent shadings which probably were of atmospheric\r\norigin and scarcely recognisable from day to day, whereas he fixed his\r\nattention upon round defined white spots, which, whatever their origin,\r\nare so far permanent that their existence has been spoken of for two\r\ncenturies. Miss Clarke thus puts the matter:—“His steady watch over them\r\nshowed the invariability of their position with regard to the\r\nterminator; and this is as much as to say that the regions of day and\r\nnight do not shift on the surface of the planet. In other words she\r\nkeeps the same face always turned towards the Sun.”\r\n\r\nVarious recent observations, some of them made with the express object\r\nof throwing light upon Schiaparelli’s conclusions, are strangely\r\ncontradictory. Perrotin at Nice in 1890 thought his observations\r\nconfirmed Schiaparelli’s; on the other hand Niesten at Brussels\r\nconsidered that numerous drawings of Venus made by himself and Stuyvaert\r\nbetween 1881 and 1890 harmonised well with Di Vico’s rotation period of\r\n23h. 21m. 22s.; which Trouvelot in 1892 only wished to increase to about\r\n24 hours.\r\n\r\nThere is a general consensus of opinion that great irregularities exist\r\non the surface of Venus. These are made specially manifest to us in\r\nconnection with the terminator or visible edge of the planet seen as an\r\nilluminated crescent. If the planet had a smooth surface this line would\r\nat all times be a perfect and continuous curve, instead of which it is\r\nfrequently to be noticed as a jagged or broken line. Observations to\r\nthis effect go back as far as 1643, when Fontana at Naples observed this\r\nto be the condition of the terminator. La Hire, Schröter, Mädler, Di\r\nVico and many others down to the present epoch have noted the same\r\nthing. The fact that the southern horn of Venus is constantly to be seen\r\nblunted is so well established as to admit of no doubt, and this\r\nblunting is commonly ascribed to the existence of a lofty mountain, to\r\nwhich Schröter ascribed a height of 27 miles. Whatever we may think as\r\nto the precise accuracy of this figure, it seems impossible to doubt the\r\nmain fact on which it depends; whilst a Belgian observer, Van Ertborn,\r\nin 1876 repeatedly saw a point of light in this locality which he\r\nregarded as due to Sun-light impinging on a detached peak, adjacent\r\nvalleys remaining in shadow. This effect is common enough in the case of\r\nthe Moon, and is familiar to all who are in the habit of studying the\r\nMoon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.—Venus, Dec. 23, 1885.]\r\n\r\nThe existence on Venus of an atmosphere of considerable density and\r\nextent is well established. Proof of this is to be found in the marked\r\ndiminution of the planet’s brilliancy towards the terminator; and in the\r\nfaint curved line of light which occasionally may be seen when the\r\nplanet is near inferior conjunction. When so situated, so much of the\r\nplanet itself as can be seen illuminated shows as a narrow radiant\r\ncrescent of light, ending off in two points called indifferently cusps\r\nor horns. It sometimes happens, however, that from the point of each\r\ncusp there runs round to the other cusp a faint continuation of the\r\ncrescent, resulting in the general appearance of the planet being that\r\nof a nearly uniform ring of light. There is no known way in which the\r\nSun can illuminate so much more than the half of Venus so as to permit\r\nof a perfect circle being visible except by supposing that an atmosphere\r\nexists on the planet and refracts (or transmits by bending, as it were,\r\nround the corner) a sufficient amount of Sun-light to give rise to the\r\nappearance in question. Further proof of the existence of an atmosphere\r\non Venus is obtainable on those very rare occasions when the planet is\r\nseen passing across the disc of the Sun—a phenomenon known as a “Transit\r\nof Venus.” It then nearly always happens that a hazy nebulous ring of\r\nfeeble light may be detected encompassing the planet’s disc indicative\r\nof course of the fact that the Sun’s rays are there slightly obstructed\r\nin reaching the eye of an observer on the Earth. Some observers\r\nscrutinising Venus when in transit have thought that they were able to\r\nobtain, by means of the spectroscope, traces of aqueous vapour on the\r\nplanet, but the evidence of this does not appear to be altogether clear\r\nor conclusive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.—Venus near conjunction as a thin crescent, Sept.\r\n21, 1887 (Flammarion).]\r\n\r\nEverybody may be presumed to be acquainted with the spectacle popularly\r\nknown as “The Old Moon in the New Moon’s Arms” whereby when the Moon is\r\nonly about two or three days old and exhibits but a narrow crescent of\r\nbright light, yet the whole outline of the disc is traceable on the sky.\r\nA phenomenon analogous to this may often be seen in the case of Venus\r\nwhen near its inferior conjunction. With the Moon the cause is due to\r\nthe reflection of Earth-light (so to speak) to the Moon, but that\r\nexplanation seems inadequate in respect of Venus, because it is\r\nconceived that the amount of Earth-light available is altogether\r\ninsufficient for the purpose. Many other explanations have been put\r\nforward including phosphorescence on the surface of Venus, electrical\r\ndisplays in the nature of terrestrial auroræ, and what not, but it must\r\nbe frankly confessed that astronomers are all at sea on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe existence of snow at the poles of Venus has been suspected by\r\nobservers of tried skill and experience such as Phillips and Webb,\r\nthough the idea was first broached by Gruithuisen in 1813. Flammarion’s\r\nobservations during 1892 and the two following years are distinctly\r\nconfirmatory of this idea. He adds that as both polar caps are visible\r\nat the same time the planet’s axis cannot be much inclined to the plane\r\nof its orbit.\r\n\r\nCompared with all the other planets the absolute brightness of Venus\r\nstands very high. Of course it must be understood that by this phrase\r\n“absolute brightness” no more is meant than its reflective power. Venus\r\nis what it is by virtue of its power of reflecting Sun-light; presumably\r\nit has no inherent brightness of its own. What its reflective power is\r\nwas probably never more effectively brought under the notice of a human\r\neye than on September 26, 1878, when Nasmyth enjoyed an opportunity of\r\nseeing Venus and Mercury side by side for several hours in the same\r\nfield of view. He speaks of Venus as resembling clean silver and Mercury\r\nas nothing better than lead or zinc. Seeing that owing to its greater\r\nproximity to the Sun the light incident on Mercury must be some 3½ times\r\nas strong as the light incident on Venus, it follows that the reflective\r\npower of Venus must be very great. As a matter of fact it has been\r\ncalculated to be nearly equal to newly fallen snow; in other words to\r\nreflect fully 70 per cent. of the light which impinges on it.\r\n\r\nVenus has no satellite; this fact seems certain. Yet half a dozen or\r\nmore observers between 1645 and 1768 discovered such a satellite;\r\nobserved it; followed it! This startling mystery, as it really was,\r\nattracted some years ago the attention of a very careful Belgian\r\nobserver, Stroobant, who examined in a most painstaking manner all the\r\nrecorded observations. His conclusions were that in almost all cases\r\nparticular stars (which he identified) were mistaken for a satellite.\r\nWhere the object seen was not capable of identification, possibly it was\r\na minor planet; whilst in one instance it was probable that it was\r\nUranus which had been seen and regarded as a satellite of Venus.\r\n\r\nVenus is perhaps the planet which has most impressed the popular mind.\r\nFor the earliest illustration of this statement we must go as far back\r\nas Homer who makes two references to it in the _Iliad_. These, in Pope’s\r\nversion, run as follows:—\r\n\r\n  “As radiant Hesper shines with keener light,\r\n  Far beaming o’er the silver host of night.”\r\n                                                       —xxii. 399 [318].\r\n\r\n  “The morning planet told th’ approach of light;\r\n  And fast behind, Aurora’s warmer ray\r\n  O’er the broad ocean pour’d the golden day.”\r\n                                                      —xxiii. 281 [226].\r\n\r\nThe phases of Venus were first discovered by Galileo and were made known\r\nto the world, or rather to Kepler, in a mystic sentence which has often\r\nbeen quoted:—\r\n\r\n  “_Hæc immatura, a me jam frustra leguntur—oy._”\r\n\r\n  “These things not ripe; at present [read] in vain [by others] are read\r\n              by me.”\r\n\r\nThe former sentence transposed becomes—\r\n\r\n  _Cynthiæ figuras æmulatur mater amorum._\r\n\r\n  The mother of loves [Venus] imitates the phases of Cynthia [the Moon].\r\n\r\nVenus revolves round the Sun in 224½ days at a mean distance of about 67\r\nmillions of miles. Its apparent diameter varies between 9½″ in superior\r\nconjunction, and 62″ in inferior conjunction. The real diameter is about\r\n7500 miles; in other words Venus is nearly as large as the Earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n                               THE EARTH.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo us, as its inhabitants, the Earth appeals in two characters, and in\r\nwriting a book on astronomy it is necessary, yet difficult, to keep\r\nthese two characters separate. The Earth is an ordinary planet member of\r\nthe solar system, amenable to the same laws, impelled by the same\r\nforces, and going through the same movements as the other members of the\r\nSun’s _entourage_. Yet, by reason of the fact that we are ourselves on\r\nthe Earth and are not spectators of it looking at it from at a distance,\r\nthere are many phenomena coming under our notice which require special\r\ntreatment, and it is often very difficult to say where the province of\r\nthe astronomer ends and that of the geographer begins. This volume being\r\nspecially designed to deal with astronomical matters, I shall pass over\r\nmany subjects which may be said to be on the border line, and which some\r\nof my readers may therefore be disappointed not to find discussed.\r\nBesides the geographer, the geologist and his scientific brother the\r\nmineralogist are concerned with the Earth regarded as a planet moving\r\nthrough space as the other planets do. The geologist studies the actual\r\nstructure of the Earth, its circumstances and history so far as they\r\nhave been revealed to us, whilst the mineralogist investigates and names\r\nthe materials of which it is composed, and classifies such materials\r\nwith the assistance of the geologist on the one hand and of the chemist\r\non the other. All these subordinate sciences—subordinate I mean from an\r\nastronomer’s point of view—open up very varied, instructive, and\r\ninteresting fields of study, but they are of course foreign to the\r\npurpose of the present volume.\r\n\r\nThough the Earth is commonly regarded as a sphere it is not that in\r\nreality, because it is not of identical dimensions from east to west and\r\nfrom north to south. It is somewhat flattened at the poles; its polar\r\ndiameter is less than its equatorial diameter, in the ratio of about 298\r\nto 299, or, expressed in miles, its polar diameter is about 26 miles\r\nless than its equatorial diameter. If a globe 3 feet in diameter be\r\ntaken to represent the Earth, then the polar diameter will, on this\r\nscale, be ⅛ inch too long. This flattening of the poles of the Earth\r\nfinds its counterpart, so far as we know, in most, and probably in all\r\nof the planets. It is most considerable and therefore most conspicuous\r\nin the case of Jupiter. It ought here to be added that a suspicion\r\nexists that the equatorial section of the Earth is not a perfect circle,\r\nbut that the diameter of the Earth, taken through the points on the\r\nequator marked by the meridians 13° 58′ and 193° 58′ east of Greenwich,\r\nis one mile longer than the diameter at right angles to these two\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nThe science which inquires into matters of this kind, including besides\r\nthe figure of the Earth, the length of the degree at different\r\nlatitudes, and the distances of places from one another, alike in\r\nangular measure and in time, is called Geodesy; it is, in point of fact,\r\nland-surveying on a very large scale, in which instruments and processes\r\nof astronomical origin are brought into operation, and in which\r\nastronomers are more or less required to take the lead.\r\n\r\nAlthough we all of us now perfectly understand that the Earth is a\r\nplanet moving round the Sun as a centre, it is, comparatively speaking,\r\nbut recently that this fact has become generally recognised and\r\nunderstood. It is true that we can discover here and there in ancient\r\nwritings some trace of the idea, yet it is doubtful whether 2000 years\r\nago more than a few “advanced” thinkers thoroughly and clearly accepted\r\nit as a distinct truth. It was much more in consonance with popular\r\nthought and the actual appearance of things that the Earth should be the\r\ncentre round which the Sun revolved and on which the planets depended;\r\nand accordingly, sometimes in one shape and sometimes in another, the\r\nnotion of the Earth being the centre of the universe was generally\r\naccepted. The contrary opinion had, however, a few sympathisers. For\r\ninstance, Aristarchus of Samos, who lived in the third century before\r\nthe Christian era, supposed, if we may trust the testimony of Archimedes\r\nand Plutarch, that the Earth revolved round the Sun; this, however, was\r\nregarded as a “heresy,” in respect of which he was accused of “impiety.”\r\nSome few years elapsed and a certain Cleanthes of Assos is said by\r\nPlutarch to have suggested that the great phenomena of the universe\r\nmight be explained by assuming that the Earth was endued with a motion\r\nof translation round the Sun together with one of rotation on its own\r\naxis. The historian states that this idea was so contrary to the\r\nreceived opinions that it was proposed to put Cleanthes on his trial for\r\nimpiety.\r\n\r\nIn former times the philosophers who studied the solar system ranged\r\nthemselves in several “schools of thought,” to use a modern hackneyed\r\nphrase. Some upheld the Ptolemaic system, which took its name from a\r\ngreat Egyptian astronomer, Claudius Ptolemy, though it does not appear\r\nthat he was actually the first to suggest it. The Ptolemaic system\r\nregarded the Earth as the centre, with the following bodies, all called\r\nplanets, revolving round it in the order stated:—the Moon, Mercury,\r\nVenus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn. It will be observed that\r\nthere are seven bodies here named, and as seven was regarded as the\r\n“number of perfection,” it was in later times considered that only these\r\nseven bodies (neither more nor less) could really be the Earth’s\r\ncelestial attendants. Though Ptolemy was in one sense an Egyptian, there\r\nyet prevailed amongst the Egyptians at large another theory slightly\r\ndifferent from Ptolemy’s. According to the “Egyptian theory,” Mercury\r\nand Venus were regarded as satellites of the Sun, and not as primary\r\nplanets appurtenant to the Earth.\r\n\r\nAfter Ptolemy’s era many centuries elapsed, during which the whole\r\nsubject of the solar system lay practically dormant, and it continued so\r\nuntil the revival of learning brought new theorists upon the scene. The\r\nmost important of these was Copernicus, who, in the sixteenth century,\r\npropounded a theory which eventually superseded all others, and, with\r\nslight modifications, is the one now accepted. Copernicus placed the Sun\r\nin the centre of the system, and treated it as the point around which\r\nall the primary planets revolved. So far, so good; but Copernicus went\r\nastray on the question of the orbits of the planets. He failed to\r\nrealise the true character of the curves which they follow and treated\r\nthese curves as “epicycles,” which word may be described as representing\r\na complicated combination of little circles which taken together form a\r\nbig one. It was left to Kepler and Newton to settle all such details on\r\na true and firm basis. But before this stage was reached a man of the\r\nhighest astronomical attainments and practical experience, Tycho Brahe,\r\nmade shipwreck of his reputation as an astronomer by solemnly reviving\r\nthe idea of the Earth being the immovable centre of everything. He\r\ntreated the Moon as revolving round the Earth at no great distance and\r\nthe Sun as doing the same thing a little farther off; the five planets\r\nrevolving round the sun as solar satellites. The “Tychonic system,” as\r\nit is called, has something in common with the Ptolemaic system without\r\nbeing by any means as logical as the latter. That such far-fetched ideas\r\nas Tycho’s should have been palmed off on the world of science so\r\nrecently as 300 years ago is passing strange; but the explanation\r\nappears to be that his action arose out of a misconception of certain\r\npassages of Holy Scripture, which seemed irreconcilable with the\r\nCopernican theory. It must not be forgotten that Copernicus’s famous\r\nbook, published in 1543, in which he had announced his views, had been\r\ncondemned by the Papal “Congregation of the Index;” and therefore Tycho\r\nmight have had as a further motive a desire to curry favour with the\r\nauthorities of the Church of Rome, and to gratify his own vanity at the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\nWith these explanations it will no longer be misleading if, for\r\nconvenience sake, I speak of a certain great circle of the heavens as\r\napparently traversed by the Sun every year, owing to the revolution of\r\nour Earth round that body. This circle is called the “Ecliptic,” and its\r\nplane is usually employed by astronomers as a fixed plane of reference.\r\nIt must be distinguished from that other great circle called the\r\n“celestial equator,” which is the plane of the Earth’s equator extended\r\ntowards the stars. The plane of the equator is inclined to the ecliptic\r\nat an angle of about 23½°, which angle is known as the “obliquity of the\r\necliptic.” It is this inclination which gives rise to the seasons which\r\nfollow one another in succession during our annual journey round the\r\nSun. The two points where the celestial equator and the ecliptic\r\nintersect are called the “equinoxes,” of spring or autumn as the case\r\nmay be; the points midway between these being the “solstices,” of summer\r\nor winter as the case may be. These words need but little explanation,\r\nat any rate, as regards those persons who are able to trace the Latin\r\norigin of the words. “Equinox” is simply the place occupied by the Sun\r\ntwice every year (namely about March 20 and September 22), when day and\r\nnight are theoretically equal throughout the world, when also the sun\r\nrises exactly in the east and sets exactly in the west. The “solstices”\r\nrepresent the standing still of the sun at the given times and places,\r\nand are the neutral points where the Sun attains its greatest northern\r\nor southern declination. This usually occurs about June 21 and December\r\n21. It must not be forgotten by the way, that the above application of\r\nthe words “summer” and “winter” to the solstices is only correct so far\r\nas concerns places in northern terrestrial latitudes—Europe and the\r\nUnited States, for instance. In southern terrestrial latitudes—for\r\ninstance, when speaking of what happens at the Cape of Good Hope and in\r\nAustralia—the words must be reversed.\r\n\r\nWe have seen in a previous chapter that whilst the orbits of the planets\r\nare nearly true circles, none of them are quite such: and the departure\r\nfrom the truly circular form results in some important consequences.\r\nWhilst some of these are too technical to be explained in detail here,\r\none at least must be referred to because of what it involves. Not only\r\nis the Earth’s orbit eccentric in form, but its eccentricity varies\r\nwithin narrow limits; and besides this the orbit itself, as a whole, is\r\nsubject to a periodical shift of place, from the joint effect of all\r\nwhich changes it comes about that our seasons are now of unequal length,\r\nthe spring and summer quarters of the year unitedly extending to 186\r\ndays, whilst the autumn and winter quarters comprise only 178 days. The\r\nsun therefore has the chance of shining for a longer absolute period of\r\ntime over the northern hemisphere than over the southern hemisphere;\r\nhence the northern is the warmer of the two hemispheres, because it has\r\na better, because a longer, chance of storing up an accumulation of\r\nsolar radiant heat. Probably it is one result of this that the north\r\npolar regions of the Earth are easier of access than the south polar\r\nregions. In the northern hemisphere navigators have reached to 81° of\r\nlatitude, whereas 71° is the highest limit yet attained in the southern\r\nhemisphere. Readers who have studied the history of explorations in the\r\nArctic regions will not need to be reminded of the controversy which has\r\nso often arisen respecting the existence or nonexistence of an “Open\r\nPolar Sea.”\r\n\r\nIt has already been hinted that it is not an easy matter to determine,\r\nwhen dealing with the Earth, where astronomy and its allied sciences,\r\ngeography, geodesy and geology respectively, begin and end. But as\r\ncertain topics connected with these sciences, such as the rotundity of\r\nthe Earth and its rotation on its axis, will come more conveniently\r\nunder consideration in other volumes of this series, I shall pass them\r\nover and only treat of a few things which more directly concern the\r\nstudent of nature observing either with or without the assistance of a\r\ntelescope.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the Earth is surrounded by a considerable atmosphere\r\nlargely composed of aqueous vapour has a material bearing on the success\r\nor failure of observations made on the Earth of bodies situated at a\r\ndistance. It may be taken as a general rule that the nearer an observer\r\nis to the surface of the sea, or otherwise to the surface of the land at\r\nthe sea-level, the greater will be the difficulty which will confront\r\nhim in carrying on astronomical observations. Hence such observations\r\nare generally made with unsatisfactory results on the sea coast or on\r\nthe banks of rivers. An interesting but rather ancient illustration of\r\nthis last-named fact is to be found in the circumstance that Copernicus,\r\nwho died at the age of 70, complained in his last moments that much as\r\nhe had tried he had never succeeded in detecting the planet Mercury, a\r\nfailure due, as Gassendi supposed, to the vapours prevailing near the\r\nhorizon at the town of Thorn on the banks of the Vistula where the\r\nillustrious philosopher lived.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena depending on the presence of aqueous vapour in the\r\natmosphere which especially under the notice of the astronomer are\r\nRefraction, Twilight, and the Twinkling of the Stars.\r\n\r\nRefraction is what it professes to be, a bending, and what is bent is\r\nthe ray of light coming from a celestial object to a terrestrial\r\nstation. Olmsted has put the matter in this way:—“We must consider that\r\nany such object always appears in the direction in which the _last_ ray\r\nof light comes to the eye. If the light which comes from a star were\r\nbent into fifty directions before it reached the eye, the star would\r\nnevertheless appear in a line described by the ray nearest the eye. The\r\noperation of this principle is seen when an oar, or any stick, is thrust\r\ninto the water. As the rays of light by which the oar is seen have their\r\ndirection changed as they pass out of water into air, the apparent\r\ndirection in which the body is seen is changed in the same degree,\r\ngiving it a bent appearance—the part below the water having apparently a\r\ndifferent direction from the part above.” The direction of this\r\nrefraction is determined by the general law of optics that when a ray of\r\nlight passes out of a rarer into a denser medium (for instance out of\r\nair into water, or out of space into the Earth’s atmosphere) it is bent\r\n_towards_ a perpendicular to the surface of the medium; but when it\r\npasses out of a denser into a rarer medium it is bent _from_ the\r\nperpendicular. The effect of refraction is to make a heavenly body\r\nappear to have an apparent altitude greater than its true altitude, so\r\nthat, for example, an object situated actually _in_ the horizon will\r\nappear _above_ it. Indeed it sometimes happens that objects which are\r\nactually below the horizon and which otherwise would be invisible were\r\nit not for refraction are thus brought into sight. It was in consequence\r\nof this that on April 20, 1837, the Moon rose eclipsed before the Sun\r\nhad set.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Holland thus alludes to the phenomenon:—“I am tempted to\r\nnotice a spectacle, having a certain association with this science,\r\nwhich I do not remember to have seen recorded either in prose or poetry,\r\nthough well meriting description in either way. This spectacle requires,\r\nhowever, a combination of circumstances rarely occurring—a perfectly\r\nclear Eastern and Western horizon, and an entirely level intervening\r\nsurface, such as that of the sea or the African desert—the former\r\nrendering the illusion, if such it may be called, most complete to the\r\neye. The view I seek to describe embraces the orb of the setting Sun,\r\nand that of the full Moon rising in the East—_both above the horizon at\r\nthe same time_. The spectator on the sea between, if he can discard from\r\nmental vision the vessel on which he stands, and regard only these two\r\ngreat globes of Heaven and the sea-horizon circling unbroken around him,\r\ngains a conception through this spectacle clearer than any other\r\nconjunction can give, of those wonderful relations which it is the\r\ntriumph of astronomy to disclose. All objects are excluded save the Sun,\r\nthe Moon, and our own Globe between, but these objects are such in\r\nthemselves that their very simplicity and paucity of number enhances the\r\nsense of the sublime. Only twice or thrice, however, have I witnessed\r\nthe sight in its completeness—once on a Mediterranean voyage between\r\nMinorca and Sardinia—once in crossing the desert from Suez to Cairo,\r\nwhen the same full Moon showed me, a few hours later, the very different\r\nbut picturesque sight of one of the annual caravans of Mecca pilgrims,\r\nwith a long train of camels making their night march towards the Red\r\nSea.”[3]\r\n\r\nIt is due to the same cause that the Sun and the Moon when very near the\r\nhorizon may often be noticed to exhibit a distorted oval outline. The\r\nfact simply is, that the upper and the lower limbs undergo a different\r\ndegree of refraction. The lower limb being nearer the horizon is more\r\naffected and is consequently raised to a greater extent than the upper\r\nlimb, the resulting effect being that the two limbs are seemingly\r\nsqueezed closer together by the difference of the two refractions. The\r\nvertical diameter is compressed and the circular outline becomes thereby\r\nan oval outline with the lesser axis vertical and the greater axis\r\nhorizontal.\r\n\r\nThough the foregoing information merely embraces a few general\r\nprinciples and facts, the reader will have no difficulty in\r\nunderstanding that refraction exercises a very inconvenient disturbing\r\ninfluence on observations which relate to the exact places of celestial\r\nobjects. No such observations are available for mutual comparison,\r\nhowever great the skill of the observer, or the perfection of his\r\ninstrument, unless, and until certain corrections are applied to the\r\nobserved positions in order to neutralise the disturbing effects of\r\nrefraction. In practice this is usually done by means of tables of\r\ncorrections, those in most general use being Bessel’s. Inasmuch as\r\nrefraction depends upon the aqueous vapour in the atmosphere, its amount\r\nat any given moment is affected by the height of the barometer and the\r\ntemperature of the air. Accordingly when, for any purpose, the utmost\r\nprecision is required, it is necessary to take into account the height\r\nof the barometer and the position of the mercury in the thermometer at\r\nthe moment in question. At the zenith there is no refraction whatever,\r\nobjects appearing projected on the background of the sky exactly in the\r\nposition they would occupy were the earth altogether destitute of an\r\natmosphere at all. The amount of the refraction increases gradually, but\r\nin accordance with a very complex law, from the zenith to the horizon.\r\nThus the displacement due to refraction which at the zenith is nothing\r\nand at an altitude of 45° is only 57″ becomes at the horizon more than\r\n½°. One very curious consequence is involved in the fact that the\r\ndisplacement due to refraction is at the horizon what it is; the\r\ndiameter both of the Sun and Moon may be said to be ½°, more or less, so\r\nthat when we see the lower edge of either of these luminaries just\r\n_touching_ the horizon _in reality_ the whole disc is completely _below_\r\nit, and would be altogether hidden by the convexity of the earth were it\r\nnot for the existence of the earth’s atmosphere and the consequent\r\nrefraction of the rays of light passing through it from the Sun (or\r\nMoon) to the observer.\r\n\r\nTwilight is another phenomenon associated with astronomical principles\r\nand effects which depends in some degree on the Earth’s atmosphere and\r\non the laws which regulate the reflection and refraction of light. After\r\nthe Sun has set it continues to illuminate the clouds and upper strata\r\nof the air just as it may often be seen shining on the tops of hills\r\nlong after it has disappeared from the view of the inhabitants of the\r\nplains below, and indeed may illuminate the chimneys of a house when it\r\nis no longer visible to a person standing in the garden below. The air\r\nand clouds thus illuminated reflect some of the Sun’s light to the\r\nsurface of the earth lying immediately underneath, and thus produce\r\nafter sun-set and before sun-rise, in a degree more or less considerable\r\naccording as the Sun is only a little or is much depressed below the\r\nhorizon, that luminous glow which we call “twilight.” This word is of\r\nSaxon origin and implies the presence of a twin, or double, light. As\r\nsoon as the Sun has disappeared below the horizon all the clouds\r\noverhead continue for a few minutes so highly illuminated as to reflect\r\nscarcely less light than the direct light of the Sun. As, however, the\r\nSun gradually sinks lower and lower, less and less of the visible\r\natmosphere receives any portion of its light, and consequently less and\r\nless is reflected minute by minute to the Earth at the observer’s\r\nstation until at length the time comes when there is no sunlight to be\r\nreflected—and it is night. The converse of all this happens before and\r\nup to sun-rise; night ceases, twilight ensues, gradually becoming more\r\ndefinite; the dawn appears, and finally the full Sun bursts forth. It\r\nmay here be stated as a note by the way that the circumstances under\r\nwhich the Sun first shows itself after it has risen above the horizon\r\nhas some bearing on the probable character of the weather which is at\r\nhand. When the first indications of day-light are seen above a bank of\r\nclouds it is thought to be a sign of wind; but if the first streaks of\r\nlight are discovered low down, that is in, or very near the horizon,\r\nfair weather may be expected.\r\n\r\nTwilight is usually reckoned to last until the Sun has sunk 18° below\r\nthe horizon, but the question of its duration depends on where the\r\nobserver is stationed, on the season of the year, and (in a slight\r\ndegree) on the condition of the atmosphere. The general rule is that the\r\ntwilight is least in the tropics and increases as the observer moves\r\naway from the equator towards either pole. Whilst in the tropics a\r\ndepression of 16° or 17° is sufficient to put an end to the phenomenon,\r\nin the latitude of England a depression of from 17° to 20° is required.\r\nAs implied above, it varies with the latitude; and as regards the\r\ndifferent seasons of the year, it is least on March 1 and October 12,\r\nbeing three weeks before the vernal equinox and three weeks after the\r\nautumnal equinox. The duration at the equator may be about 1 hour 12\r\nminutes; it amounts to nearly 2 hours at the latitude of Greenwich, and\r\nso on towards the pole. At each pole in turn the Sun is below the\r\nhorizon for 6 months, but as it is less than 18° below the horizon for\r\nabout 3½ of those 6 months it may be said that there is a continual\r\ntwilight for those 3½ months. Something of the same sort of thing as\r\nthis occurs in the latitude of Greenwich, for there is no true night at\r\nGreenwich from May 22 to July 21, but constant twilight from sunset to\r\nsunrise, or 2 months of twilight in all. Though twilight at the equator\r\nis commonly set down as lasting about an hour, this period is there, as\r\nelsewhere, affected by the elevation of the observer above the\r\nsea-level. Where the air is very rarified, as at places situated as\r\nQuito and Lima are, the twilight is said to last no more than 20\r\nminutes, and this would accord with the theory that where there is no\r\nair at all (_e.g._, on the Moon) there is no twilight at all. The\r\ngreater purity and clearness of mountain air, rarified as it is, is\r\nanother cause which contributes to vary by reducing the duration of\r\ntwilight.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes stated that a secondary twilight may be noticed, and Sir\r\nJohn Herschel has spoken of it as “consequent on a re-reflection of the\r\nrays dispersed through the atmosphere in the primary one. The phenomenon\r\nseen in the clear atmosphere of the Nubian Desert, described by\r\ntravellers under the name of the ‘afterglow,’ would seem to arise from\r\nthis cause.” I am not acquainted with any records which throw light on\r\nthese remarks of Sir John Herschel.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon of twinkling is a subject which has been much neglected,\r\npossibly on account of its apparent, but only apparent, simplicity. The\r\nfamiliar verse of our days of childhood—\r\n\r\n  “Twinkle, twinkle little star,\r\n  How I wonder what you are,\r\n  Up above the earth so high,\r\n  Like a diamond in the sky,”\r\n\r\ncontains even in this simple form a good deal of food for reflection;\r\nwhilst the new version—\r\n\r\n  “Twinkle, twinkle little star,\r\n  Now we’ve found out what you are,\r\n  When unto the midnight sky\r\n  We the spectroscope apply,”\r\n\r\ndoes so yet more.\r\n\r\nAs an optical phenomenon the twinkling, or to use the more scientific\r\nphrase, the scintillation, of the stars is a matter which has been\r\nstrangely ignored by physicists. Indeed, the only investigators who seem\r\nto have dealt with it in any sort of detail are two Italians, Secchi and\r\nRespighi, Dufour, a Frenchman, Montigny, a Belgian, and the Rev. E.\r\nLedger, an Englishman. Secchi has truly remarked that the twinkling of\r\nthe stars is one of the most beautiful of the minor phenomena of the\r\nheavens. Light, sometimes bright, sometimes feeble, sometimes white,\r\nsometimes red, darts about in intermittent gleams, like the sparkling\r\nflashes of a well-cut diamond, and works upon the feelings of even the\r\nmost stolid spectator. The theory of twinkling is still surrounded by\r\nmany difficulties. One thing, however, is certain—it has nothing to do\r\nwith recurrent changes in the intrinsic light or physical condition of\r\nthe star itself, but arises during the passage of its rays through our\r\natmosphere; it depends, therefore, in some way or other on the varying\r\nconditions of the atmosphere. On the summit of high mountains, according\r\nto the observations of all careful observers (notably Tacchini, who\r\nstudied the subject on Mount Etna), the light of the stars is steady,\r\nlike that of the planets; and it is so likewise during the hours of calm\r\nwhich often precede terrestrial storms. The vibrations are usually more\r\nfrequent near the horizon, and diminish with the elevation of the star\r\nabove the horizon; in other words, with the lessening of the thickness\r\nof the atmospheric strata which the rays of light have to traverse.\r\nNevertheless, during windy weather, and specially with northerly wind,\r\nit may be noticed that the stars twinkle high up above the horizon, and\r\neven as far as the zenith. From these and other similar considerations\r\nwe are justified in drawing the conclusion that twinkling largely\r\ndepends on the condition and movements of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\nSecchi further points out that it is impossible to study carefully with\r\nthe naked eye all the features of twinkling, and that telescopic\r\nassistance is imperatively necessary. When, with the aid of a telescope,\r\nwe scrutinise a star during a disturbed evening marked by much twinkling\r\nwe see an image diffused and undefined and surrounded by rays, as if\r\nseveral images were superposed, and were jumping about rapidly. On such\r\noccasions we do not see that little defined disc surrounded by\r\nmotionless diffraction rings, ordinarily indicative of a tranquil\r\natmosphere. With a telescope armed with a medium power, the field of\r\nview of which is more extensive than that of a high power, we find that\r\nif a light tap is given to the telescope, the ordinary simple image is\r\nchanged into a luminous curve, the perimeter of which is formed entirely\r\nof a succession of arcs exhibiting the colours of the rainbow. This\r\ncoloured curve does not, in principle, differ from what one sees on\r\nswinging round and round in the air such a thing as a stick, the end of\r\nwhich is alight, having been freshly taken from a fire. The glowing tip\r\nproduces in appearance a continuous arc, the result of the persistence\r\nof the image of the tip on the retina. In such a case the colour is\r\nconstant, because the illumination resulting from the blazing wood does\r\nnot vary; but in the case of a star the arcs are differently coloured\r\nduring the very brief space of time in which the vibrating telescope\r\ntransports the image from one side to another of the visible field. This\r\nexperiment is from its nature very crude, but the idea was improved upon\r\nand reduced to a systematic shape by Montigny, who introduced into his\r\ntelescope, at a certain distance from the eyepiece, a concave lens\r\neccentrically placed with respect to the axis of the instrument, and\r\nendued with a rapid movement of rotation imparted by suitable mechanism.\r\nHe thus obtained images which revolved with regularity, and so was able\r\nto submit certain features of the phenomenon to a definite system of\r\nmeasurement. To cut a long story short, Montigny started with the\r\nassumption (made good by the sequel) that possibly stars were affected\r\nin their twinkling by intrinsic constitutional differences; and that\r\npossibly Secchi’s classification of stars into four types (a\r\nclassification which depends on the spectra which they yield) might put\r\nhim on the track of some intelligible conclusions with respect to the\r\ntheory of twinkling.[4]\r\n\r\nThe results he ultimately arrived at were, that the yellow and red stars\r\nof the IInd and IIIrd types twinkle less rapidly than the white stars of\r\nthe Ist type. Whilst the average number of scintillations per second of\r\nthe stars of type III. were 56, those of type II. were 69, and those of\r\ntype I. 86. These differences may be confidently said to depend upon too\r\nmany observations of too many different stars to be fortuitous. Montigny\r\nalso arrived at a number of incidental conclusions of considerable\r\ninterest. The one main thread running through them, is that there is a\r\nconnection between the twinkling of a star and its spectrum, which had\r\nnever before been thought of. We are justified, indeed, in going so far\r\nas to say, that Montigny’s observations point distinctly to a law on\r\nthis subject, the law being that the more the spectrum of a star is\r\ninterrupted by dark lines, the less frequent are its scintillations. The\r\nindividual character of the light, therefore, emitted by any given star\r\nappears to affect its twinkling, both as regards the frequency thereof\r\nand the colours displayed.\r\n\r\nMontigny collected some other interesting facts with reference to\r\ntwinkling, which may here be stated in a concise form. There is a\r\ngreater display of twinkling in showery weather, than when the\r\natmosphere is in a normal condition; and in winter than in summer,\r\nwhatever may be the weather. In dry weather in Spring and Autumn the\r\ntwinkling is about the same, but wet has more effect in Autumn than in\r\nSpring in developing the phenomenon. Variations in the barometric\r\npressure and in the humidity of the air also affect the amount of\r\ntwinkling; there is more before a rainy period, likely to last 2 or 3\r\ndays, than before a single, or, so to speak, casual rainy day. Twinkling\r\nalso varies with the aggregate total rain-fall of any group of days,\r\nbeing more pronounced as the rain-fall is greater, but decreasing\r\nsuddenly and considerably as soon as the rainy condition of the\r\natmosphere has passed away. The number of scintillations found to be\r\nobservable with the aid of Montigny’s instrument (which he called a\r\n“_scintillomètre_”), varied from a minimum of 50 during June and July,\r\nto 97 in January, and 101 in February, increasing and decreasing in\r\nregular sequence from month to month. When an Aurora Borealis is\r\nvisible, there is a marked increase in the amount of twinkling. It would\r\nbe interesting to follow up this last named discovery by an endeavour to\r\nascertain whether the fluctuations which are coincident in point of time\r\nwith an Auroral display depend upon optical considerations connected\r\nwith the Aurora, or on physical considerations having any relation to\r\nthe increased development of terrestrial magnetism.\r\n\r\nI have been thus particular in unfolding somewhat fully the present\r\nstate of our knowledge concerning the twinkling of the stars, because it\r\nis evident that there are many interesting points connected with it,\r\nwhich may be studied by any patient and attentive star-gazer, and which\r\ndo not need the instrumental appliances and technical refinements which\r\nare only to be found in fully-equipped public and private observatories.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned in conclusion that the planets twinkle very\r\nlittle, or, more often, not at all. This is mainly due to the fact that\r\nthey exhibit discs of sensible diameter and therefore that there is, as\r\nYoung puts it, “a general unchanging average of brightness for the sum\r\ntotal of all the luminous points of which the disc is composed. When,\r\nfor instance, point A of the disc becomes dark for a moment, point B,\r\nvery near to it, is just as likely to become bright; the interference\r\nconditions being different for the 2 points. The different points of the\r\ndisc _do not keep step_, so to speak, in their twinkling.” The\r\nnon-twinkling of planets because they possess sensible discs is often\r\navailable as a means for determining when a planet is looked for, which,\r\nof several objects looked at, is the planet wanted and which are merely\r\nstars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n                               THE MOON.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Moon being merely the satellite of a planet, to wit, the Earth, it\r\nshould, according to the plan of this book, be included in the chapter\r\nwhich deals with its primary; but for us inhabitants of the Earth the\r\nMoon has so many special features of interest that it will be better to\r\ngive it a special chapter to itself.\r\n\r\nWe may regard the Moon in a twofold aspect, and consider what it is as a\r\nmere object to look at, and what it does for us; probably my present\r\nreaders will prefer that most prominence shall be given to the former\r\naspect. The Moon as seen with the naked eye exhibits a silvery mass of\r\nlight, which at the epoch of what is called “full Moon” has a seemingly\r\neven circular outline. Full or not full, its surface appears to be\r\nirregularly shaded or mottled. The immediate cause of this shading is\r\nthe fact that the surface of the Moon, not being really smooth, reflects\r\nirregularly the Sun’s light which falls upon it. The _causa causans_ of\r\nthis is the existence of numerous mountains and valleys on its surface,\r\nand which were first discovered to be such by Galileo. That there are\r\nmountains is proved by the shadows cast by their peaks on the\r\nsurrounding plains, when the Sun illuminates the Moon obliquely—that is,\r\nwhen the Moon is shining either as a crescent or gibbous. Such shadows,\r\nhowever, disappear at the phase of “Full-Moon,” because the Sun’s rays\r\nthen fall perpendicularly on the Moon’s surface. When the Moon presents\r\neither a crescent or a gibbous form (in point of fact when it presents\r\nany form except that of “Full-Moon”), the boundary line which separates\r\nthe illuminated from the unilluminated portion (and which boundary line\r\nis generally spoken of as the “terminator”) has a rough, jagged\r\nappearance; this is due to the fact that the Sun’s light falls first on\r\nthe summits of the peaks, and that the adjacent valleys and declivities\r\nare in shade. These remain so till by reason of the Moon’s progress in\r\nits orbit a sufficient time has elapsed for the Sun to penetrate to the\r\nbottom of the valleys. With this explanation the reader will have no\r\ndifficulty in realising why the terminator always exhibits an irregular\r\nor jagged edge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11.—Mare Crisium. (Lick Observatory photographs.)]\r\n\r\nVarious mountains on the Moon to the number of more than a thousand have\r\nbeen mapped, and their elevations calculated. Of these fully half have\r\nreceived names, being those of men of various dates and nationalities,\r\nwho have figured conspicuously in the annals of science, including some,\r\nhowever, who have not done so. Whilst many of these mountains are\r\nisolated elevations, not a few form definite chains of mountains, and to\r\ncertain of these chains definite names, borrowed from the Earth, have\r\nbeen given. Thus we find on maps of the Moon the “Apennines,” the\r\n“Alps,” the “Altai Mountains,” the “Dörfel Mountains,” the “Caucasus\r\nMountains,” and so on.\r\n\r\nBesides the mountains there exist on the Moon a number of plains\r\nanalogous in some sense to the “steppes” of Asia and the “prairies” of\r\nNorth America. These were termed “seas” in the early days of the\r\ntelescope, because it was assumed that as they were so large and so\r\nsmooth they were vast tracts of water. This supposition has long ago\r\nbeen overthrown, but the names have been retained as a matter of\r\nconvenience. Hence it comes about that in descriptions of the Moon one\r\nmeets with such names as _Mare Imbrium_, the “Sea of Showers”; _Mare\r\nSerenitatis_, the “Sea of Serenity”; _Mare Tranquillitatis_, the “Sea of\r\nTranquillity”; and so on. It seems probable that the so-called seas\r\nrepresent in nearly its original form what was once the original surface\r\nof the Moon before the mountains were formed. A confirmation of this\r\nidea is to be found in the fact that though these plains are fairly\r\nlevel surfaces compared with the masses of mountains which hedge them in\r\non all sides, yet the plains themselves are dotted over with\r\ninequalities (small elevations and pits), which seem to suggest that\r\nsome of them might eventually have developed into mountains if the\r\nfurther formation of mountains had not been arrested by the fiat of the\r\nCreator.\r\n\r\nThough hitherto we have been speaking of the mountains of the Moon under\r\nthat generic title, it is necessary for the reader to understand that\r\nthe Moon’s surface exhibits everywhere remarkable illustrations of those\r\ngeological processes which we on the earth associate with the word\r\n“volcano.” There cannot be the least doubt that the existing surface of\r\nthe Moon, as we see it, owes all its striking features to volcanic\r\naction, differing little from the volcanic action to which we are\r\naccustomed on the earth. That this theory is well founded may be very\r\neasily inferred by comparing the structural details of certain\r\nterrestrial volcanoes and their surroundings with a typical lunar\r\nmountain, or indeed, I might say, with any lunar mountain. This point\r\nwas very well worked out some 40 years ago by Professor Piazzi Smyth,\r\nwho placed on pictorial record his results of an examination and survey\r\nof the Peak of Teneriffe. Any person seeing side by side one of Smyth’s\r\npictures of Teneriffe and a picture of any average lunar crater would\r\nfind great difficulty if the pictures were not labelled in determining\r\nwhich was which.\r\n\r\nThe one special feature of the Moon, which never fails to attract the\r\nattention of everybody who looks at our satellite for the first time\r\nthrough a telescope, are the crater mountains, which indeed constitute\r\nan immense majority of all the lunar mountains. Their outline almost\r\nalways conforms, more or less, to that of the circle, but when seen near\r\neither limb of the Moon they often appear considerably oval simply\r\nbecause they are then seen considerably foreshortened. In their normal\r\nform they exhibit a basin bounded by a ridge, with a conical elevation\r\nin the centre of the basin, the basin and the cone together being\r\nevidently the result of an uprush of gases breaking through the outer\r\ncrust of the Moon and carrying with them masses of molten lava. This\r\nlava, with perhaps the materials in fragments, projected in the first\r\ninstance up into the air, fell back on to the Moon forming first of all\r\nthe outer edge of the basin, and subsequently, as the eruptive force\r\nbecame weakened, the small central accumulation, which took, as it\r\nnaturally would do, a conical shape. An experimental imitation of the\r\nprocess thus inferred was carried out some years ago by a French\r\nphysicist, Bergeron, who acted upon a very fusible mixture of metals\r\nknown as Wood’s alloy by forcing through it a current of hot air. The\r\nsuccess of this experiment was complete, and Bergeron considered that\r\nhis experiments, taken as a whole, were calculated to throw much light\r\non the past history of the Moon.\r\n\r\nSeveral observers at various times have fancied they have seen signs\r\nthat the lunar mountain Aristarchus was an active volcano even up to the\r\npresent century; but it admits of no doubt that this idea is altogether\r\na misconception, and that what they saw as a faint illumination of the\r\nsummit of Aristarchus was no more than an effect of earth-shine. On the\r\ngeneral question of volcanic action on the Moon, Sir John Herschel\r\nsummed up as follows:—“Decisive marks of volcanic stratification arising\r\nfrom successive deposits of ejected matter, and evident indications of\r\nlava currents, streaming outwards in all directions, may be clearly\r\ntraced with powerful telescopes. In Lord Rosse’s magnificent Reflector\r\nthe flat bottom of the crater called Albategnius is seen to be strewed\r\nwith blocks not visible in inferior telescopes, while the exterior ridge\r\nof another (Aristillus) is all hatched over with deep gulleys radiating\r\ntowards its centre.”\r\n\r\nThe valleys and clefts or rills visible on the Moon’s surface constitute\r\nanother remarkable feature in the topography of our satellite. The\r\nvalleys, properly so-called, require no particular comment, because they\r\nare just what their name implies—hollows often many miles long and\r\nseveral miles wide. The clefts or rills, however, are more mysterious,\r\nby reason of their great length and remarkable narrowness. One is almost\r\nled to infer that they are naught else but cracks in the lunar crust,\r\nthe result of sudden cooling, how caused is of course not known.\r\n\r\nThere is another lunar feature to be mentioned somewhat akin to the\r\nforegoing in appearance but apparently, however, owing its origin to a\r\ndifferent cause. I refer to the systems of bright streaks which,\r\nespecially at or near the time of full Moon, are seen to radiate from\r\nseveral of the largest craters, and in particular from Tycho,\r\nCopernicus, Kepler and Aristarchus. These bright streaks extend in many\r\ncases far beyond what may fairly be considered as the neighbourhood of\r\nthe craters from which they start, traversing distant mountains, valleys\r\nand other craters in a way which renders it very difficult to assign an\r\nexplanation of their origin.\r\n\r\nThere are 13 areas on the Moon, which used to be regarded as “seas,” one\r\nof them, however, bearing the name of “_Oceanus Procellarum_,” the\r\n“Ocean of Storms”; but besides these there are several bays, termed in\r\nLatin _Sinus_, of which the most important is the _Sinus Iridum_ or the\r\n“Bay of Rainbows,” a beautiful spot on the northern border of the _Mare\r\nImbrium_, and best seen when the Moon is between 9 and 10 days old. The\r\nsummits of the semi-circular range of rocks which enclose the bay are\r\nthen strongly illuminated and a greenish shadow marks the valley at its\r\nbase. By the way, it is worth mentioning that not a few of the lunar\r\nseas, so-called, seem to be pervaded by a greenish hue, though no\r\nparticular explanation of this fact is forthcoming.\r\n\r\nMuch controversy has ranged round the question whether or not the Moon\r\nhas an atmosphere. Without doubt the preponderance of opinion is on the\r\nnegative side, though it must be admitted that some observers of\r\neminence have suggested that there are indeed traces of an atmosphere to\r\nbe had, but that it is extremely attenuated and of no great extent,\r\notherwise it must render its presence discoverable by optical phenomena\r\nwhich it is certain cannot be detected.\r\n\r\nA brief reference may here be made to a curious phenomenon sometimes\r\nseen in connection with occultations of stars by the Moon. Premising\r\nthat an “occultation” is the disappearance of a star behind the solid\r\nbody of the Moon by reason of the forward movement of the Moon in her\r\norbit, it must be stated that though generally the Moon extinguishes the\r\nstar’s light instantaneously, yet this does not invariably happen, for\r\nsometimes the star seems to hang upon the Moon’s limb as if reluctant to\r\ndisappear. No very clear or satisfactory explanation of this phenomenon\r\nhas yet been given; the existence of a lunar atmosphere would be an\r\nexplanation, and accordingly this anomalous appearance, seen on\r\noccasions, has been advanced in support of the theory that a lunar\r\natmosphere does exist; but, nevertheless, astronomers do not accept that\r\nidea.\r\n\r\nAny one desirous of carrying out a careful study of the Moon’s surface\r\nmust be provided with a good map, and for general purposes none is so\r\nconvenient or accessible as Webb’s, reduced from Beer and Mädler’s\r\n_Mappa Selenographica_ published in 1837, of which another reproduction\r\nis given in Lardner’s _Astronomy_. Those, however, who would desire to\r\nstudy the Moon with the utmost attention to detail must provide\r\nthemselves with Schmidt’s map published in 1878 at the expense of the\r\nGerman Government. When it is stated that this map represents the Moon\r\non a circle 7½ feet in diameter, the size and amount of detail in it\r\nwill be readily understood. Special books on the Moon furnishing\r\nnumerous engravings and detailed descriptions have been written by\r\nCarpenter and Nasmyth (jointly) and by Neison.\r\n\r\nVarious attempts have been made to determine the amount of light\r\nreflected by the Moon, and also the question whether it yields any\r\nmeasurable amount of heat. As regards the light of the full Moon\r\ncompared with that of the Sun, the estimates range from 1/300000 to\r\n1/800000, a discrepancy not perhaps greater than might be expected under\r\nthe circumstances of the case.\r\n\r\nWith respect to the heat possessed by, or radiated from the Moon’s\r\nsurface, the conclusions of those who have attempted to deal with the\r\nmatter are less consistent. As regards the surface of the Moon itself\r\nSir John Herschel was of opinion that it is heated at least to the\r\ntemperature of boiling water, but that owing to the radiant heat having\r\nto pass through our atmosphere, which acts as an obstacle, it is no\r\nwonder that it should be difficult for us to become conscious of its\r\nexistence. In 1846 Melloni, by concentrating the rays of the Moon with a\r\nlens 3 feet in diameter, thought he detected a sensible elevation of\r\ntemperature; and in 1856 C. P. Smyth at Teneriffe, but with inferior\r\ninstrumental appliances, arrived at the same conclusion. Though\r\nProfessor Tyndall in 1861 obtained a contrary result, yet the most\r\nrecent experiments by the younger Earl of Rosse, Professor Langley, and\r\nothers, all tend to show that the Moon does really radiate a certain\r\ninfinitesimally small amount of heat. Perhaps, however, it will be best\r\nto give Langley’s ideas as to this in his own words:—“While we have\r\nfound abundant evidence of heat from the Moon, every method we have\r\ntried, or that has been tried by others, for determining the character\r\nof this heat appears to us inconclusive; and without questioning that\r\nthe Moon radiates heat earthward from its soil, we have not yet found\r\nany experimental means of discriminating with such certainty between\r\nthis and reflected heat that it is not open to misinterpretation.” It is\r\nobvious from the foregoing that we on the Earth need not concern\r\nourselves very much about lunar heat; and I will only add that F. W.\r\nVery, by an ingenious endeavour to localise the Moon’s radiant heat, has\r\nbeen able, he thinks, to establish the fact that on the part of the Moon\r\nto which the Sun is setting, what he calls the heat-gradient (using a\r\nphrase suggested by terrestrial meteorology) appears to be steeper than\r\non that part to which the Sun is rising. Generally, Very’s observations\r\naccord fairly with Lord Rosse’s.\r\n\r\nThe Moon revolves round the Earth in 27 d. 7 h. 43 m. 11 s. at a mean\r\ndistance of 237,300 miles, in an orbit which is somewhat, but not very,\r\neccentric. Its angular diameter at mean distance is 31′ 5″, or, say,\r\njust over ½°. The real diameter may be called 2160 miles.\r\n\r\nA few words will probably be expected by the reader on the subject of\r\nlunar influences on the weather, and generally; this being a matter\r\nhighly attractive to the popular mind. The truth appears to lie, as\r\nusual, between two extremes of thought. The Moon, of course, is the main\r\ncause of the tides of the Ocean, and it is not entirely inconceivable\r\nthat tidal changes imparted to vast masses of water may be either\r\nsynchronous with, or may in some way engender, analogous movements in\r\nthe Earth’s atmosphere; though no distinct proofs of this, as a\r\ndeterminate fact, can be brought forward.\r\n\r\nThere is no doubt whatever that at or near the time of full Moon,\r\nevening clouds tend to disperse as the Moon comes up to the meridian,\r\nand that by the time the Moon has reached the meridian a sky previously\r\novercast will have become almost or quite clear. Sir John Herschel has\r\nalluded to this by speaking of a “tendency to disappearance of clouds\r\nunder a full Moon”; and he considers this “fully entitled to rank as a\r\nmeteorological fact.” He goes on, not unnaturally, to suggest the\r\nobvious thought that such dissipation of terrestrial clouds is due to\r\nthe circumstance that, assuming heat really comes by radiation from the\r\nMoon (and we have seen on a previous page the probability of this) such\r\nradiant heat will be more potential if it falls on the Earth\r\nperpendicularly, as from a Meridian Moon, than if it comes to us at any\r\none locality from a Moon low down in the observer’s horizon, and\r\ntherefore has to pass through the denser strata of the Earth’s\r\natmosphere and suffer material enfeeblement accordingly. I am aware that\r\nMr. Ellis, late of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, has sought to show\r\nby a seemingly powerful array of statistics that the idea now under\r\nconsideration is unfounded, but I consider that we have here only one\r\nmore illustration of the familiar statement that you can prove anything\r\nyou like by statistics. I am firmly convinced, as the result of more\r\nthan 30 years’ observation, that terrestrial clouds do disperse under\r\nthe circumstances stated. Sir J. Herschel added that his statement\r\nproceeded from his own observation “made quite independently of any\r\nknowledge of such a tendency having been observed by others. Humboldt,\r\nhowever, in his _Personal Narrative_, speaks of it as well known to the\r\npilots and seamen of Spanish America.” Sir John Herschel further\r\nremarked:—“Arago has shown from a comparison of rain, registered as\r\nhaving fallen during a long period, that a slight preponderance in\r\nrespect of quantity falls near the ‘new’ Moon over that which falls near\r\nthe ‘full.’ This would be a natural and necessary consequence of a\r\npreponderance of a cloudless sky about the ‘full,’ and forms, therefore,\r\npart and parcel of the same meteorological fact.”\r\n\r\nBernadin has asserted it to be a fact that many thunderstorms occur\r\nabout the period of “new” or “full” Moon. But what I want most to warn\r\nthe reader against is that popular idea (wonderfully wide-spread it must\r\nbe admitted) that at the epochs of what are called, most illogically,\r\nthe Moon’s “changes,” changes of weather may certainly be expected.\r\nThere is absolutely no foundation whatever for this, and still more void\r\nof authority (if such a phrase is admissible) is a table of imaginary\r\nweather to be expected at changes of the Moon, often met with in books\r\npublished half a century ago, and still occasionally reprinted in\r\nthird-rate almanacs, and designated “Dr. Herschel’s Weather Table.” This\r\nprecious production is not only devoid of authenticity as regards its\r\nname, but may easily be seen to be fraudulent in its reputed facts any\r\nmonth in the year.\r\n\r\nIt would be beyond both my present available space and the legitimate\r\nobjects of this work to attempt even an outline of the influences over\r\nthings terrestrial ascribed to, or associated, rightly or wrongly, with\r\nthe Moon, and of which the word “lunatic” perhaps affords the most\r\nfamiliar exponent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n                                 MARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMars, though considerably smaller than the Earth, is commonly regarded\r\nas the planet which, taken all in all, bears most resemblance to the\r\nEarth, though only one-fourth its size. Under circumstances which have\r\nalready been briefly alluded to in Chapter I., Mars exhibits from time\r\nto time a slight phase, but nothing approaching in amount the phases\r\npresented by the two inferior planets, Mercury and Venus. When in\r\nopposition to the Sun, that is to say when on the meridian at midnight,\r\nit has a truly circular disc; but between opposition and its two\r\npositions of quadrature it is gibbous. At the minimum phase, which is at\r\neach quadrature, E. or W. as the case may be, the planet resembles the\r\nMoon 3 days from its “full.” These phases are an indication that Mars\r\nshines by the reflected light of the Sun. It is a remarkable tribute to\r\nGalileo’s powers of observation that with his trumpery telescope, only a\r\nfew inches long, he should have been able to suspect the existence of a\r\nMartial phase. Writing to a friend in 1610 he says:—“I dare not affirm\r\nthat I can observe the phases of Mars; however, if I mistake not, I\r\nthink I already perceive that he is not perfectly round.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.—Four views of Mars differing 90° in longitude\r\n(Barnard).]\r\n\r\nThe period in which Mars performs its journey round the Sun (called the\r\nsidereal period) is about 687 days; but owing to the Earth’s motion we\r\nare more concerned with what is called the planet’s synodical period of\r\n780 days than with its sidereal period of 687 days. The synodical period\r\nis the interval between two successive conjunctions or oppositions of\r\nthe planet as regards the Earth, and 780 days being twice 365 and 50\r\ndays over, it follows that we have an opportunity of seeing the planet\r\nat its best about every 2 years; and this is one of the reasons why Mars\r\nhas been so much and so thoroughly studied as regards its physical\r\nappearance. Of course Mars is not equally well seen every 2 years,\r\nbecause it may so happen at a given opposition that it may be at its\r\nnearest to the Sun (perihelion), and the Earth at its farthest from the\r\nSun (aphelion), in which case the actual distance between the two bodies\r\nwill be the greatest possible. What is therefore wanted is for the\r\nplanet to be nearest to the Sun and nearest to the Earth at the same\r\ntime, under which circumstances it shines with a brilliancy rivalling\r\nJupiter. This favourable combination occurs once in 7 synodical\r\nrevolutions, or about every 15 years. The most favourable oppositions\r\noccur at the end of August, and the least favourable at the end of\r\nFebruary. The next very favourable opposition will not occur until 1909.\r\nMars may approach to within about 35 millions of miles from the Earth at\r\na favourable opposition, whilst under extreme circumstances the other\r\nway it may be no nearer than 61 millions of miles at opposition.\r\n\r\nMars in opposition is a very conspicuous object in the Heavens, shining\r\nwith a fiery red light which has always been regarded as a peculiar\r\nattribute of the planet, so much so that its name, or epithet, in many\r\nlanguages conveys the idea of “fiery” or “blazing.” It is recorded that\r\nin August 1719 its brilliancy was such as to cause a panic amongst the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nTelescopically examined, Mars is always found to exhibit patches of\r\nshade of various sizes and shapes, and, on the whole, fairly permanent\r\nfrom year to year. During the last few years in particular these\r\nmarkings have been subjected to very careful scrutiny and measurement at\r\nthe hands of numerous observers of skill and experience, and armed in\r\nmany cases with very powerful telescopes. The conjoint effect of the\r\nobservations obtained has been largely to augment our knowledge of the\r\nplanet’s geography, or (to use the proper term) “areography.” Before\r\ndescribing the minutest details recorded and pencilled by the best\r\nobservers, it will be best to speak of the leading general features\r\nwhich are within the grasp of comparatively small telescopes—say,\r\nrefractors of 6 inches and reflectors of 12 inches in aperture. The\r\nfirst thing which presents itself as very obvious on the disc of Mars,\r\nis the fact that certain portions are ruddy, whilst others are greenish\r\nin hue. It is generally assumed that the red areas represent land and\r\nthe green areas water. On this subject Sir John Herschel’s remarks,\r\npenned about half a century ago, may be said still to stand good. He\r\nascribes the ruddy colour to “an ochrey tinge in the general soil, like\r\nwhat the red sandstone districts on the Earth may possibly offer to the\r\ninhabitants of Mars, only more decided.” The propriety of this thought\r\nwill be best appreciated by a reader who has travelled through parts of\r\nNorth Gloucestershire, and seen a succession of ploughed fields in that\r\nlocality. The deep red colour of the soil is in many places very\r\nconspicuous. It has often been remarked that the redness of Mars is much\r\nmore noticeable with the naked eye than with a telescope; and Arago\r\ncarried this idea one step further in suggesting that the higher the\r\noptical power the less the colour. This, however, might naturally be\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\nThe most prominent surface marking on Mars is that known as the “Kaiser\r\nSea,” sometimes called the “V-mark” from its resemblance to that letter,\r\nthough a leg of mutton would be quite as good a simile. East of the\r\nKaiser Sea and a little north of the planet’s equator is a well-defined\r\ndark streak known as “Herschel II. Strait”; whilst on the west side is\r\nanother shaded area which has been called “Flammarion Sea.” These three\r\nfeatures are so very conspicuous, that, provided the hemisphere in which\r\nthey are situated is fairly in front of the observer, his telescope, if\r\nit will show anything on Mars, will show these. The white patches seen\r\non certain occasions _at_ Mars’s N. pole and _close to_ its S. pole form\r\nanother special feature of interest connected with this planet. It\r\nadmits of no doubt whatever that these are immense masses of snow and\r\nice which undergo at stated intervals changes analogous to the changes\r\nwhich we know happen in the great fields of ice situated in the regions\r\nof the Earth surrounding the Earth’s two poles. Not only do these white\r\npatches look like snow, but if attention is paid to the changes they\r\nundergo and the epochs at which the changes take place there will be\r\nfound abundant confirmation of this theory, for these patches decrease\r\nin size when brought under the Sun’s influence on the approach of summer\r\nand increase again in size when the summer is over and winter draws\r\nnear. In the second half of 1892 the Southern Pole was in full view, and\r\nduring especially July and August the diminution of the snow area from\r\nweek to week was very evident. Schiaparelli, who observed it with great\r\nattention during that season, noted at the commencement of the season\r\nthat the snow reached at the first as far as latitude 70° and formed a\r\npolar cap some 1200 miles in diameter. Its subsequent decrease, however,\r\nwas so marked that two or three months later the diameter of the snow\r\npatch had dwindled to no more than 180 miles, and became indeed still\r\nsmaller at a later period. The summer solstice on Mars occurred on\r\nOctober 13, 1892, which was therefore the epoch of midsummer for Mars’s\r\nsouthern hemisphere. Whilst these changes were taking place in the\r\nsouthern hemisphere, no doubt changes of the reverse character were\r\ngoing on in the northern hemisphere, but they were not visible from the\r\nEarth because the North Pole was situated in that hemisphere of Mars\r\nwhich was turned away from the Earth. In previous years, however, the\r\nNorth Pole being turned towards the Earth its snow was also seen to\r\nundergo the same sort of change; in other words, was seen to melt. This\r\nhappened, and was seen in 1882, 1884, and 1886. These observations of\r\nthe alternate increase and decrease of the polar snow on Mars may be\r\nviewed with telescopes of moderate power, but of course it is more\r\ninteresting and profitable to watch them with a large telescope. The\r\nfact (for it is an undoubted fact) that the north polar snow is\r\nconcentric with the planet’s axis whilst the southern polar patch is\r\neccentric to the extent of about 180 miles from the southern pole is one\r\nwhich has not yet received a satisfactory explanation. If both patches\r\nwere eccentric so as to be exactly opposite to one another an\r\nexplanation would be much more easy for we might say that the poles of\r\nrotation lay in one direction and the poles of cold in another.\r\n\r\nI have spoken on a previous page of three specially conspicuous shadings\r\nof Mars, and other similar shadings to the number perhaps of a couple of\r\ndozen were generally recognised by astronomers (having been mapped and\r\nnamed) down to about the year 1877. In that year the astronomical world\r\nwas startled by the announcement that Schiaparelli of Milan, an able and\r\ncompetent observer, had discovered that those shaded areas which all\r\nprevious astronomers had regarded as continents or vast tracts of land,\r\nwere in reality islands, that is to say, so far, that the continents in\r\nquestion were cut up by innumerable channels intersecting one another at\r\nvarious angles. When this discovery was announced, and older\r\nobservations and drawings came to be examined, it was found, or at\r\nany-rate thought, that these so-called canals might be traced in\r\ndrawings of earlier dates by Dawes, Secchi, and Holden. So much for\r\n1877. In December, 1881, the planet was again in opposition, but farther\r\noff in distance, and therefore smaller in size than in 1877. It was,\r\nhowever, higher up in the Heavens as seen at Milan and the weather\r\nappears to have been more favourable. In these altered circumstances\r\nSchiaparelli again saw his canals, but this time they were in at least\r\nas many as twenty instances seen in duplicate; that is to say, a twin\r\ncanal was seen to run parallel to the original one at a distance of from\r\n200 to 400 miles, as the case might be. The existence of not only single\r\ncanals but of twin canals seems an established fact, for Schiaparelli’s\r\ndrawings and descriptions have been confirmed by competent testimony;\r\nbut explanation is nowhere; especially in view of Schiaparelli’s own\r\nidea that the duplication of his canals is perhaps not a permanent\r\nfeature but a periodical phenomenon depending on, or connected in some\r\nway with, Mars’s seasons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.—Mars, August 27, 1892 (Guiot).]\r\n\r\nSeveral points stand out clearly established by the observations of Mars\r\nduring the opposition of 1894, especially the correctness of\r\nSchiaparelli’s discoveries and maps. Most of the canals originally seen\r\nby him were again seen, and thus their existence was confirmed, whilst\r\nnew ones were also noticed. Many of these canals were double. The great\r\nextent of the S. Polar cap and its rapid disappearance as Mars’s summer\r\napproached was also a special feature of the observations of 1894. It\r\ndwindled until it became almost invisible, or at best showed as a tiny\r\nspeck. It is thought by some observers that as the Polar cap melts, the\r\nwater collects round the Pole, and thence flows over the planet’s\r\nsurface, giving rise to the phenomenon of canals, and that this is the\r\nway the planet’s surface is irrigated. It may here be remarked that the\r\nword “canal,” which has been given to these dark streaks crossing and\r\ncutting up the large areas of land in Mars, is an unfortunate one,\r\nsuggesting as it does artificial agency. But these Martial canals are\r\nprobably, especially the largest, a great many miles in width and\r\nhundreds of miles in length, though some are smaller; and they are\r\nprobably nature’s method of distributing over the continents and lands\r\nof Mars the water which collects round the Pole during the rapid melting\r\nof the Polar snows.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the presence of cloud or mist on Mars also received strong\r\nconfirmation in 1894. Large portions of the planet’s disc were found to\r\nbe hidden from view. “Herschel I. Continent” and the “Maraldi Sea” (both\r\nwell-known markings on Mars, readily visible with small telescopes) were\r\nat times quite obscured by cloud. Indeed, the Maraldi Sea was\r\noccasionally quite blotted out: other well-known markings were also\r\neither blotted out or only faintly seen. These facts seem almost to\r\nprove conclusively the existence of cloud and vapour in Mars, especially\r\nas some of these markings subsequently again assumed their ordinary form\r\nand colour. Bright projections too were seen at times on the terminator\r\nof Mars, giving rise to the belief that there are high mountains on the\r\nplanet, though some observers regarded these projections as high clouds\r\npowerfully reflecting the Sun’s light.\r\n\r\nMars rotates on its axis in 24h. 37m. 22s., a period so nearly\r\ncoincident with the period of the Earth’s rotation as greatly to\r\nfacilitate the mapping of Mars’s features by work continued from day to\r\nday by observers who have the necessary instrumental means and artistic\r\nskill in handling the pencil.\r\n\r\nMars has an atmosphere which may be said to be no more than moderately\r\ndense; that is to say much less dense than the Earth’s atmosphere. Of\r\ncourse the existence of snow, which has been taken for granted on a\r\nprevious page, carries with it the existence of water and aqueous\r\nvapour—a fact capable of independent spectroscopic proof.\r\n\r\nThe inclination of Mars’s axis to the ecliptic has not been ascertained\r\nwith all desirable certainty, but if Sir W. Herschel’s estimate that the\r\nobliquity on Mars is 28¾° (the Earth’s obliquity being 23½°) is correct,\r\nit is evident that there must be a very close similarity between the\r\nseasons of the Earth and the seasons of Mars, thereby furnishing another\r\nlink of proof to support the statement made at the commencement of this\r\nchapter that, taken all in all, Mars is the planet which bears most\r\nresemblance to the Earth.\r\n\r\nThe apparent absence of satellites in the case of Mars was long a matter\r\nof regret to astronomers; they seemed to think that such a planet ought\r\nto have at least one companion. At last, in 1887, two were found by Hall\r\nat Washington, U. S., using a very fine refractor of 26 inches aperture.\r\nThese satellites, which have been named Phobos and Deimos, are, however,\r\nvery small, for Phobos at its best only resembles a star of mag. 11½,\r\nwhilst Deimos is no brighter than a star of mag. 13½; from this it will\r\nbe understood that only very large telescopes will show either of them.\r\nPhobos revolves round Mars in 7½ hours at a distance of about 6000\r\nmiles, whilst Deimos revolves in 30 hours at a distance of about 15,000\r\nmiles. It has been thought that neither of them can be more than about 6\r\nor 7 miles in diameter, and therefore that they can not afford much\r\nlight to their primary.\r\n\r\nMars revolves round the Sun in 686d. 23h. 30m., at a mean distance of\r\n141 million of miles, which the eccentricity of its orbit may increase\r\nto 154 millions or diminish to 128 millions. The planet’s apparent\r\ndiameter varies between 4″ in conjunction and 30″ in opposition. Owing\r\nto the great eccentricity of the orbit the planet’s apparent diameter as\r\nseen from the Earth varies very much at different oppositions. The real\r\ndiameter is rather more than 4000 miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n                           THE MINOR PLANETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1772 a German astronomer named Bode, of Berlin, drew attention to\r\ncertain curious numerical relations subsisting between the distances of\r\nthe various planets. This “law,” as it has been sometimes called,\r\nusually bears Bode’s name, though it was not he but J. D. Titius of\r\nWittemberg who really first discovered it.\r\n\r\nTake the numbers—\r\n\r\n  0, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, 96, 192, 384;\r\n\r\neach of which (the second excepted) is double the preceding; adding to\r\neach of these numbers 4 we obtain—\r\n\r\n  4, 7, 10, 16, 28, 52, 100, 196, 388;\r\n\r\nwhich numbers approximately represent the distances of the planets from\r\nthe sun expressed in radii of the Earth’s orbit. A little table will\r\nmake the matter more clear.\r\n\r\n  Planets.     Distance: Bode’s Law.

Before, however, this scheme was got into\r\nworking order, Piazzi, director of the Observatory at Palermo, on\r\nJanuary 1, 1801, noted an 8th magnitude star in Taurus, which on the\r\nnext and succeeding nights he saw again, and found had moved. He\r\nobserved the strange object for 6 weeks, when illness interrupted him.\r\nHowever he wrote letters announcing what he had seen, one of them to\r\nBode himself; but this letter, though dated Jan. 24, did not reach Bode\r\nat Berlin, till March 20—a striking illustration of the state of the\r\nPostal service on the Continent less than 100 years ago. The new body,\r\nat first assumed to be a tailless comet, was eventually recognised to be\r\na new planet; and the name of Ceres, the tutelary goddess of Sicily, was\r\nat Piazzi’s instance bestowed upon it.\r\n\r\nLooking for Ceres in March, 1802, Olbers at Bremen, came upon another\r\nnew planet, which was afterwards named Pallas. At first he thought he\r\nhad got hold of a new variable star, but two hours sufficed to show that\r\nthe object under notice was in motion. The two new bodies were found to\r\nbe so much alike in size and appearance, and in their orbits, that\r\nOlbers suggested both were but fragments of some larger body which had\r\nbeen shattered by some great convulsion of nature. The idea was a daring\r\none, and it was an attractive one, though now regarded as untenable.\r\nHowever it served the purpose of stimulating research, and the discovery\r\nof Pallas was followed by that of Juno, by Harding, at Lilienthal 1804;\r\nand of Vesta, by Olbers, at Bremen in 1807.\r\n\r\nThe organised search for minor planets was relinquished in 1816,\r\npresumably because no more planets seemed to be forthcoming, and it does\r\nnot appear that any further attempts were made by anybody till about\r\n1830, when a Prussian amateur, named Hencke of Driessen, profiting by\r\nthe publication of some new star maps put forth by the Berlin Academy,\r\ncommenced a methodical search for small planets. These Berlin maps, one\r\nfor each hour of R. A., were only completed in 1859, and, therefore,\r\nHencke had only a small number of them at his command during the early\r\nyears of his labours. Still it is strange that 15 years elapsed before\r\nhis zeal and perseverance were rewarded, his first discovery, the planet\r\nAstræa, not taking place till December 1845. Once however the ice was\r\nbroken new planets followed with considerable rapidity, and beginning\r\nwith 1847, no year has elapsed without several or many having been\r\nfound. During the last decade the number detected annually has been very\r\ngreat—sometimes as many as 20 in a year, but this has been the result of\r\nphotography being brought to bear on the work. It is obvious that if a\r\nphotograph of a given field taken on any one day is compared with a\r\nphotograph taken a few days earlier or later, and any of the objects\r\nphotographed have moved, their change of place will soon be noticed and\r\nwill be a distinct proof of their planetary nature.\r\n\r\nIt seems quite certain that all the larger of these planets have now\r\nbeen found, for the average brilliancy (and this no doubt means the\r\naverage size) of those recently discovered has been steadily diminishing\r\nyear by year, and it looks as if the limit of visibility will soon be\r\nreached, if it has not been reached already.\r\n\r\nThe three largest of these bodies, in order of size, have generally been\r\nthought to be Vesta, Ceres, and Pallas; but Barnard, from observations\r\nmade in 1894, concluded that Ceres is 520 miles in diameter; Pallas, 304\r\nmiles; and Vesta, 241 miles. As to all the rest of the minor planets,\r\nexcepting Juno, Hornstein is of opinion that those having a greater\r\ndiameter than 25 geographical miles are few in number, and that the\r\nmajority of them are no larger than from 5 to 15 miles in diameter.\r\n\r\nFrom what has gone before the reader will readily infer that these minor\r\nplanets are of no sort of interest to the casual amateur who dabbles in\r\nAstronomy; and indeed that they are of very little interest to anybody.\r\nWith a few general statistics, therefore, this chapter may be concluded.\r\nThe total number of minor planets now known nearly reaches 500, and\r\nevery year increases the list; but not, however, at as rapid a rate as\r\nwas once the case, because the German mathematicians, who alone latterly\r\nhave been willing to trouble themselves with the computation of the\r\norbits, are understood to have announced that they are no longer able to\r\nkeep pace with the discoveries made. Those who care to investigate in\r\ndetail the circumstances of these planets will find great extremes in\r\nthe nature of the orbits. Whilst the planet nearest to the Sun has a\r\nperiod of only 3 years, the most distant occupies nearly 9 years in\r\nperforming its journey round the Sun. So, also, there are great\r\ndifferences in the eccentricities of the orbits and in their\r\ninclinations to the ecliptic. Whilst one planet revolves almost in the\r\nplane of the ecliptic, another (Pallas) has an orbit which is inclined\r\nno less than 34° to the ecliptic. One word, in conclusion, as to the\r\nnames applied to these bodies. At the outset the names given were,\r\nwithout exception, chosen from the mythologies of ancient Greece and\r\nRome, but, latterly, the most fantastic and ridiculous names have in\r\nmany cases been selected, names which in too many instances have served\r\nno other purpose than that of displaying the national or personal vanity\r\nof the astronomers who applied them to the several planets. The French\r\nare great offenders in this matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n                                JUPITER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe planet Jupiter occupies, in one sense, the first position in the\r\nplanetary world, it being the largest of all the planets. Moreover, with\r\nthe exception of Venus, it is the brightest of the planets. As with\r\nMars, and for the like reason, Jupiter, when in the positions known as\r\nthe Quadratures (or near thereto), exhibits a slight phase, but owing to\r\nthe far greater distance from the Sun of Jupiter, compared with Mars,\r\nthe deviation of the illuminated surface from that of a complete circle\r\nis very small; it is, however, perceptible at or near the time of\r\nquadrature, a slight shading off of the limb farthest from the Sun being\r\ntraceable.\r\n\r\nJupiter is noteworthy on account of two features, both of them more or\r\nless familiar, at least by name, to most people—its belts and its\r\nsatellites,—both of which will be described in due course.\r\n\r\nThe belts are dusky streaks, which vary from time to time both in\r\nbreadth and number: most commonly two broad belts will be seen with two\r\nor three narrower ones on either side; but sometimes all are rather\r\nnarrow, and their narrowness is made up for by an increase in their\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.—Jupiter, November 27, 1857 (Dawes).]\r\n\r\nUnder all circumstances they lie practically parallel, or nearly so, to\r\nthe planet’s equator. It is generally thought that the planet, whatever\r\nmay be its actual structure or constitution, is surrounded by a dense\r\ncloudy envelope, and that the shaded streaks which we call belts are\r\nrifts in this atmosphere, which expose to view the solid body of the\r\nplanet underneath. Whether, however, the term “solid body” is an\r\naccurate one to be used in this connection is thought by some to be open\r\nto doubt. The laws which regulate the existence of these belts are quite\r\nunknown; indeed it seems doubtful whether any laws exist at all, for the\r\nbelts at one time appear to undergo constant change, whilst at another\r\ntime they remain almost unchanged for several months. It has been\r\nsuggested that when the changes are rapid it must be presumed that great\r\natmospheric storms are to be considered as in progress, and possibly\r\nthis may be the true explanation. Belts are commonly non-existent\r\nimmediately under the equator; whilst north and south of this void space\r\nit most usually happens that there is one broad belt and several\r\nnarrower ones in each hemisphere. At each pole the planet’s brightness\r\nis less than the average brightness, but it cannot exactly be said that\r\nthis is due to the existence there of belts properly so called.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly considered that no tinges of colour could be traced on\r\nJupiter except a silvery gray of different degrees of intensity; but\r\nduring the last thirty years there can be no doubt that shades of brown,\r\nred, and orange, of no great depth, but yet quite definite have been\r\ntraceable. Many observers concur in this opinion. Whether this detection\r\nof colour is due to an absolute development of colour during the period\r\nin question; or whether its detection is merely the result of more\r\ncareful scrutiny with better instruments is a matter as to which the\r\nevidence is not clear. Though the general position of the belts is such\r\nthat they are parallel to the planet’s equator, yet there are sometimes\r\nexceptions to this rule, for in a few very rare instances a streak in\r\nthe nature of a narrow belt has been seen, inclined to the equator at a\r\ndecided angle, perhaps 20° or even more.\r\n\r\nIt occasionally happens that spots are seen on Jupiter’s belts.\r\nSometimes these remain visible for a considerable period. They are\r\neither dark or luminous, and their origin is unknown. Besides these\r\ncasual spots, which are always small in size, there was visible during\r\nmany years following 1878 a very remarkable and conspicuous large spot,\r\nstrongly red in colour for several years, though it afterwards became\r\nmuch fainter. This spot exhibited an oval outline and was about 27,000\r\nmiles long and 8000 miles broad. For about 4 years it maintained its\r\nintense red colour and its shape almost unaltered; but after 1882, the\r\nshape remaining, the colour sensibly faded. The observations which were\r\nmade on this spot during 1886 by Professor Hough at Chicago, U. S., with\r\nan 18-inch refractor, led him to the opinion that the persistence of the\r\nred spot for so many years rendered untenable the generally accepted\r\ntheory that the phenomena seen on the surface of the planet are due to\r\natmospheric causes.\r\n\r\nSome astronomers have thought that a relationship subsists between the\r\nspots on the Sun and the spots on Jupiter. There certainly seems an\r\napparent identity in point of time between the two classes of spots, and\r\non the assumption that the spots on Jupiter are indicative of\r\ndisturbances on the planet, Ranyard broached the idea that both classes\r\nof phenomena are dependent on some extraneous cosmical change; and are\r\nnot related as cause and effect. Browning suggested many years ago that\r\nthe red colour of the belts is a periodical phenomenon coinciding with\r\nthe epoch of the greatest display of sunspots, but this thought does not\r\nappear to have been followed up by any one. Spots on Jupiter seem to\r\nhave been first recorded by Robert Hooke in 1664. In the following year\r\nCassini saw a spot which he found to be in motion, and by following it\r\nattentively he inferred that the planet rotated on its axis in 9h. 56m.\r\nIt is a remarkable illustration of the great care bestowed by Cassini on\r\nhis astronomical work that the best modern determinations of Jupiter’s\r\nrotation-period differ from Cassini’s estimate by only half a minute.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind the enormous size of Jupiter compared with the Earth,\r\nwhilst its period of rotation is considerably less than half the\r\nEarth’s, it will be at once seen that the velocity of matter at the\r\nplanet’s equator is immensely great—466 miles per minute against the\r\nEarth’s 17 miles per minute. One result of this is the great intensity\r\nof the centrifugal force at the equator, and likewise the greatness of\r\nthe compression of the planet’s body at the poles. Hind has suggested\r\nthat the great velocity which thus evidently exists may have the effect,\r\nby reason of the development of the heat which it gives rise to, of\r\ncompensating the planet for the small amount of heat which owing to its\r\ndistance it receives from the Sun.\r\n\r\nOn favourable occasions the brilliancy of Jupiter is very considerable;\r\nso much so that it rivals Venus and Mars. And besides this, there\r\nappears to be something special in the nature of Jupiter’s surface, for\r\nnot only does it seem to radiate a much larger proportion of the solar\r\nlight which falls on it than do the planets generally, but some\r\nobservers have expressed the opinion that it possesses inherent light of\r\nits own. Speculations, however, such as this must always be received\r\nwith reserve, because of the evident difficulty of making sure of the\r\nfacts on which they must be based. One thing, however, seems less open\r\nto doubt. Bearing in mind the small amount of heat which reaches Jupiter\r\nfrom the Sun, there is reason to infer that the clouds which certainly\r\nexist on Jupiter must owe their origin to the influence of some other\r\nheat than solar heat; in other words that Jupiter possesses sources of\r\nheat within itself.\r\n\r\nJupiter has satellites, 5 in number. The discovery of four of these, was\r\none of the first fruits of the invention of the telescope, for they were\r\nfound by Galileo in January, 1610. The 5th satellite is so small that it\r\nescaped notice until as recently as 1892, having been discovered on\r\nSeptember 9 of that year by Professor Barnard, with the great Lick\r\ntelescope in California. It is, however, so minute that one can count on\r\none’s fingers the telescopes capable of showing it.\r\n\r\nThe four old satellites of Jupiter shine as stars of about the 7th\r\nmagnitude; in other words, they are sufficiently bright to be visible\r\nwith telescopes however small: indeed several instances are on record of\r\npersons gifted with very good sight, having been able to see them with\r\nthe naked eye. For the study of their physical appearance very powerful\r\noptical assistance is necessary, but their movements are so rapid, and\r\nthe phenomena which result from those movements are so interesting, that\r\nthese bodies may be considered to occupy the first place in the\r\nstock-in-trade of every amateur astronomer, who lays himself out for\r\nplanet-gazing, with the object of profiting himself or his friends. The\r\nphenomena here alluded to are known as eclipses, transits, and\r\noccultations.\r\n\r\nThe four old satellites do not bear any names, but are numbered from the\r\ninnermost outwards, and are always alluded to by their numbers as I, II,\r\nIII and IV.\r\n\r\nAn eclipse of a Jovian satellite is identical in principle with an\r\neclipse of the Moon; that is to say, just as an eclipse of the Moon\r\nhappens when the Moon passes into and is lost in the Earth’s shadow, so\r\nan eclipse of a Jovian satellite happens when such satellite becomes\r\nlost in the shadow cast by the planet into space. The Ist IInd and IIIrd\r\nsatellites in consequence of the smallness of the inclination of their\r\norbits, undergo eclipse once in every revolution round their primary,\r\nbut the IVth is less often eclipsed, owing to the joint effect of its\r\nconsiderable orbital inclination, and of the distance to which it\r\nrecedes from its primary.\r\n\r\nAn occultation of a Jovian satellite is akin in principle to an\r\noccultation of a star by the Moon. As the Moon moving forwards suddenly\r\ncovers a star, so the planet, on occasions, suddenly covers one of its\r\nsatellites. If the satellite in question is the IVth, its disappearance\r\nbehind the planet and its reappearance from behind the planet will both\r\nbe visible in due succession. This is often true also of the IIIrd\r\nsatellite, but for reasons connected with the proximity to their primary\r\nof the Ist and IInd satellites, only their disappearance _or_\r\nreappearance (not both) can, as a rule, be observed on the same\r\noccasion. The most interesting, by far, however, of the phenomena\r\nconnected with Jupiter’s satellites are their transits in front of, that\r\nis across, the visible disc of the planet. Though these transits are of\r\nfrequent occurrence, yet they are always interesting because of the\r\ndiverse appearances which the satellites exhibit at different times, and\r\nwhich cannot be said to be in accordance with any recognised laws.\r\nMoreover, in observing the transit of a satellite, we may often see the\r\nblack shadow cast by the satellite on the planet’s disc; and this shadow\r\nwill sometimes precede and sometimes follow the satellite itself. From\r\nthe fact that the satellite generally appears as a bright spot on a\r\nbright background whilst the shadow is black, or blackish, an\r\ninexperienced observer is apt to look at the shadow and think he is\r\nseeing the satellite.\r\n\r\nJupiter revolves round the Sun in not quite 12 years at a mean distance\r\nof 483 millions of miles. Its apparent diameter varies between 50″ and\r\n30″ according to its position with respect to the Earth. Its true\r\ndiameter is about 88,000 miles. Owing to its large size and rapid\r\nrotation, as has already been mentioned, Jupiter is very much flattened\r\nat the poles. The amount of this (the polar “compression” as it is\r\ncalled) is about 1/16.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n                                SATURN.\r\n\r\n\r\nNext beyond Jupiter, proceeding outwards from the Sun, we reach the\r\nplanet Saturn, which beyond any doubt is the most beautiful and most\r\ninteresting of all the planets. Nobody who has ever had a fairly good\r\nchance of seeing it can have the least doubt that this is the case.\r\nBriefly stated the three main features which constitute its claims\r\nare:—(1) Its belts, (2) its rings, (3) its satellites.\r\n\r\nThe belts of Saturn resemble generally those of Jupiter, but they are\r\nmore faint and less changeable. Their physical cause, however, may be\r\nassumed to be the same. Taking the planet as a whole, it may be said\r\nthat its ordinary colour is yellowish white, the belts inclining to\r\ngrayish white; though the dark belts have often been thought to exhibit\r\na greenish hue. Lassell considered that the south pole is generally\r\ndarker than the north pole and more blue in tinge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.—Saturn, Jan. 26, 1889 (Antoniadi).]\r\n\r\nThere is one important particular in which the belts of Saturn differ\r\nfrom those of Jupiter. Jupiter’s belts are straight, whereas Saturn’s\r\nare sensibly curved. Supposing, as is probable, that Saturn’s belts are\r\nparallel to the planet’s equator, then we must assume that the plane of\r\nthis equator makes a rather considerable angle with the ecliptic. Spots\r\non Saturn are very rare. Whether Saturn has an atmosphere seems\r\nuncertain, or perhaps it may be said that one has not been proved to\r\nexist but may exist. The question of polar snow is also uncertain, but\r\nSir W. Herschel thought he could trace changes of hue at the poles which\r\nmight be due to the melting of snow.\r\n\r\nIt is usual to speak of the planet itself under the name of the “Ball”\r\nwhen it is not a question of referring to the whole Saturnian system\r\ncollectively. In consequence of its distance from the Sun, Saturn\r\nundergoes no equivalent to a phase; or to be more exact, no phase can be\r\ndetected, though theoretically when the planet is in quadrature the disc\r\nmust undergo an infinitesimally small loss of light.\r\n\r\nThough the point has now-a-days no scientific importance, it may perhaps\r\nbe desirable just to make a brief allusion to Sir W. Herschel’s curious\r\ntheory that Saturn was seen by him to be compressed not only at the\r\npoles but at the equator, so that it resembled a parallelogram with the\r\ncorners rounded off. It is difficult to imagine what could have given\r\nrise to this strange idea, though, of course, Herschel’s good faith in\r\nadvancing it cannot be called in question. I refer to it because it will\r\nbe found mentioned in so many books on astronomy, often under the name\r\nof the “square-shouldered” figure of Saturn. As a theory it may be\r\nregarded as quite exploded in consequence of accurate measures by\r\nBessel, Main and others having conclusively shown that the form of the\r\nball does not depart from that of a regular spheroid.\r\n\r\nIn referring to Saturn generally, we speak of its ring in the singular\r\nnumber, but, in point of fact, there are several rings—three in\r\nparticular. The principal bright ring is really double, and within the\r\ninnermost bright ring there is a dusky one, perfect as a ring, but not\r\nluminous as the outer rings are. By way of distinguishing one ring from\r\nanother, it is usual to adopt Struve’s nomenclature, whereby the\r\noutermost bright ring is called A, the inner bright ring B, and the\r\ndusky ring C.\r\n\r\nA good engraving will convey more fully and more clearly an idea of what\r\nthe Saturnian system consists of than the fullest verbal description\r\nwill do. (See _Frontispiece_.)\r\n\r\nTo the earliest astronomers who possessed telescopes, Saturn proved a\r\ngreat puzzle, because it seemed to undergo changes of shape which were\r\nquite inexplicable on any principles then known. Galileo, when first he\r\nsaw it, thought it presented an oval outline which might be due to a\r\ncentral planet having a smaller planet on each side of it, and\r\naccordingly he announced to his friend, Kepler, that the most distant\r\nplanet was _tergeminum_ or tri-form. But greater magnifying power led\r\nhim to arrive at the conclusion that the planet was not a triple\r\ncombination of spheres, but one body, either oblong or oval in outline.\r\nThis conclusion, however, was soon found to be untenable, because the\r\ntwo (supposed) tributary bodies gradually decreased in size until they\r\nentirely disappeared. Galileo writing to his friend, Welser, in December\r\n1612, thus expressed himself:—\r\n\r\n“What is to be said concerning so strange a metamorphosis? Are the two\r\nlesser stars consumed after the manner of the solar spots? Have they\r\nvanished or suddenly fled? Has Saturn, perhaps, devoured his own\r\nchildren? Or were the appearances indeed illusion or fraud, with which\r\nthe glasses have so long deceived me, as well as many others to whom I\r\nhave shewn them? Now, perhaps, is the time come to revive the well-nigh\r\nwithered hopes of those who, guided by more profound contemplations,\r\nhave discovered the fallacy of the new observations, and demonstrated\r\nthe utter impossibility of their existence. I do not know what to say in\r\na case so surprising, so unlooked for, and so novel. The shortness of\r\nthe time, the unexpected nature of the event, the weakness of my\r\nunderstanding, and the fear of being mistaken have greatly confounded\r\nme.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.—General view of the Phases of Saturn’s Rings.]\r\n\r\nGalileo seems to have become so out of heart in consequence of the\r\ndifficulty of determining what these changes really meant, that he gave\r\nup altogether observing Saturn. In the course of time, but by very\r\ngradual steps, astronomers came to realise what the facts were. The next\r\nidea that was broached, was that the planet consisted of simply one\r\ncentral ball, and that the excrescences which Galileo had been puzzled\r\nby were merely handles as they were called, (_ansæ_) projecting like the\r\nhandles, say of a soup tureen, though why they should vary in size at\r\nstated intervals remained as great a mystery as ever. It was not until\r\nabout 1656 that the true explanation was arrived at by a Dutchman, named\r\nChristopher Huygens. It was the fashion in those days for scientific men\r\nto intimate to the world discoveries which they had made by resort to\r\nmysterious anagrams, which served in some degree the purpose which in\r\nthe present day is served by the law regulating copyright or patent\r\nrights. Accordingly Huygens published the following singular\r\nmemorandum:—\r\n\r\naaaaaaa cccc d eeeee g h i iiiiii llll mm nnnnnnnnn oo oo pp q rr s\r\nttttt uuuuu.\r\n\r\nThese letters arranged in their proper order furnish the following Latin\r\nsentence:—\r\n\r\n_Annulo cingitur, tenui, plano, nusquam cohaerente, ad eclipticam\r\ninclinato_; which Latin sentence becomes in the English tongue:—\r\n\r\n“[The planet] is surrounded by a slender flat ring inclined to the\r\necliptic, but which nowhere touches [the body of the planet.]”\r\n\r\nHuygen’s discovery was not a mere piece of guesswork, for he spent\r\nseveral years carefully observing the alterations of form which Saturn\r\nunderwent, before he came to the conclusion that it was only the\r\nexistence of a ring surrounding the planet which would explain the\r\nvarious observed changes.\r\n\r\nIt was by way of guarding himself from being robbed of the fruits of his\r\ndiscovery whilst he was accumulating the necessary proof of its truth,\r\nthat he buried his thoughts in the logogriph or anagram just quoted.\r\nHaving arrived at the conclusion which he did, he thought himself\r\nsufficiently sure of his facts to predict that in July or August 1671,\r\nthe planet would again appear round, the ring becoming invisible. This\r\nsurmise proved practically correct, in so far, that in May 1671, or\r\nwithin 2 months of the time predicted by Huygens, Cassini saw the planet\r\nas a simple ball unaccompanied by any ring.\r\n\r\nThis is a convenient place at which to offer a brief explanation of the\r\nchanges of appearance as regards the ball and rings which Saturn\r\nundergoes. These changes depend jointly on Saturn’s motion in its orbit\r\nround the Sun, and on the corresponding motion of the Earth in its\r\norbit. Neither Saturn nor the Earth revolve round the Sun exactly in the\r\necliptic, and this want of coincidence results in the fact, that twice\r\nin the 29½ years occupied by Saturn in journeying round the Sun, the\r\nplane of its ring is seen edgeways by us on the Earth; whilst at two\r\nother periods intermediate but equi-distant the ring is seen opened out\r\nto the widest possible extent; that is, so far as we on the Earth can by\r\nany possibility have a chance of seeing it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.—Phases of Saturn’s Rings at specified dates.]\r\n\r\nThe appearances presented by the rings when undergoing the\r\ntransformations to which they are subject, will be readily understood by\r\nan inspection of the annexed engravings. Fig. 17, indicates the actual\r\nappearances in the years specified, and these years may be considered as\r\ncarried forward and brought up to date by substituting 1877 for 1848,\r\n1885 for 1855, 1891 for 1862, and 1898 for 1869.\r\n\r\nAdverting to fig. 16, it will suffice to remark that the two central\r\nphases of the rings, opened wide, are to be deemed co-related, or indeed\r\nidentical in a geometrical sense (so to speak) the difference being that\r\none of them is to be deemed to show the northern side of the ring (which\r\nis now in view and will continue in view till 1907) whilst the other\r\nrepresents the southern side, which was in view from 1877 till 1891. The\r\nforegoing is a brief statement of the general principle involved in the\r\nchanges which take place, but the motions of the two planets introduce\r\ncertain technical complications into the details which would be seen by\r\nan observer using a large telescope; with these, however, the ordinary\r\nreader will not care to concern himself, and need not do so.\r\n\r\nA great deal might be said with respect to the rings treated\r\ndescriptively. I will now mention a few matters of general interest.\r\nHuygens regarded the appendage to Saturn, whose existence he\r\nestablished, to be a single ring, but as far back as 1675, Cassini\r\ndetermined that Huygen’s single ring was really made up of two, one\r\nlying inside the other. Cassini in this conclusion outstepped not only\r\nall the observers of his own century, but those of the succeeding\r\ncentury, for Sir W. Herschel even 100 years after Cassini, was for a\r\nlong time unable to satisfy himself, even with his superior telescopes,\r\nthat the black streaks seen in the ring by Cassini, and regarded by him\r\nas indicative of a severance of the ring into two parts, really implied\r\na severance. It is now, however, accepted as a fact that not only are\r\nthe rings which are known as A and B absolutely distinct, but that A\r\nalso is itself certainly duplex, that is, that it certainly consists of\r\ntwo independent rings. In addition to this many competent observers\r\narmed with powerful telescopes have obtained traces of other\r\nsub-divisions, both in A and B; and though there is some want of harmony\r\nin the details, as stated by the different observers, yet undoubtedly we\r\nmust speak of Saturn’s rings collectively as forming a _multiple_\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nWhat the rings are is a highly debatable point, but the preponderating\r\nidea is that they are not what they appear to be, namely solid masses of\r\nmatter, but are swarms of independent fragments of matter. Yet\r\n“fragment” is not the best word to use, because it implies that\r\nsomething has been broken up to make the fragments. Rather, perhaps, we\r\nshould say with Professor Young, that the rings are “composed of a swarm\r\nof separate particles, each a little independent moon pursuing its own\r\npath around the planet. The idea was suggested long ago, by J. Cassini\r\nin 1715, and by Wright in 1750, but was lost sight of until Bond revived\r\nit in connection with his discovery of the dusky ring. Professor\r\nBenjamin Pierce soon afterwards demonstrated that the rings could not be\r\ncontinuous solids; and Clerk Maxwell finally showed that they can be\r\nneither solid nor liquid sheets, but that all the known conditions would\r\nbe answered by supposing them to consist of a flock of separate and\r\nindependent bodies, moving in orbits nearly circular, and in one\r\nplane—in fact, a swarm of meteors.”\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the rings seen edgeways has been variously estimated.\r\nSir J. Herschel suggested 250 miles as an outside limit, which G. P.\r\nBond reduced to 40 miles. It is generally considered, however, that 100\r\nmiles is probably not far from the truth. Young has pointed out that if\r\na model of them were constructed on the scale of 1 inch to represent\r\n10,000 miles, so that the outer ring of such a model would be nearly 17\r\ninches in diameter, then the thickness of the ring would be represented\r\nby that of an ordinary sheet of writing paper.\r\n\r\nConsidered as a system, the rings are distinctly more luminous than the\r\nplanet, and of the two bright rings, the inner one is brighter than the\r\nouter one; and the inner one is less bright at its inner edge than\r\nelsewhere. It is also to be noticed that when seen edgeways just about\r\nthe time of the Saturnian equinoxes, when the Sun is shifting over from\r\none side of the ring to the other, and the ring is dwindling down to a\r\nnarrow streak, its edges (forming the _ansæ_ as they are termed) do not\r\ndisappear and reappear at the same time, and are not always of the same\r\napparent extent. One ansa, indeed, is sometimes visible without the\r\nother, and most commonly it is the Eastern one that is missing. To what\r\ncauses these various peculiarities are due is unknown.\r\n\r\nMany physical peculiarities have been either noticed or suspected with\r\nreference to the bright rings. For instance, on comparing one with\r\nanother, some persons have thought that their surfaces are convex, and\r\nthat they do not lie in the same plane. The existence of mountains on\r\ntheir surface has more than once been suspected. Again, it has been\r\nfancied that they are surrounded by an extensive atmosphere. It seems\r\nhardly likely that the rings would have an atmosphere and not the ball\r\n(or _vice versâ_), and, therefore, no wonder that we have no\r\nobservations which countenance the idea that the ball does really\r\npossess an atmosphere. This, indeed, seems to flow from Trouvelot’s\r\nobservation, that the ball is less luminous at its circumference than at\r\nits centre.\r\n\r\nThe circumstances of ring C, otherwise called the “Dusky” or “Crape”\r\nring are as curious historically, as they are mysterious physically. In\r\n1838, Galle of Breslau, noticed what he thought to be a gradual shading\r\noff of the interior bright ring towards the ball. Though he published a\r\nstatement of what he saw, the matter seems to have attracted little or\r\nno notice. In 1850, G. P. Bond in America perceived something luminous\r\nbetween the ring and the ball, and after repeated observations in\r\nconcert with his father, came to the conclusion that the luminous\r\nappearance which he saw, was neither less nor more than an independent\r\nand imperfectly illuminated ring lying within the old rings and\r\nconcentric with them. Before, however, tidings of Bond’s discovery\r\nreached England, but a few days after the discovery in point of actual\r\ndate, Dawes suddenly noticed one evening as Bond had done, a luminous\r\nshading within the bright rings, which he was not long in finding out to\r\nbe in reality a complete ring, except so far that a portion of it was of\r\ncourse hidden from view behind the ball. He, and O. Struve likewise,\r\nnoticed that this new Dusky Ring was occasionally to be seen divided\r\ninto two or more rings. The Dusky Ring is transparent, though this fact\r\nwas not ascertained until 1852, or two years after Bond’s discovery of\r\nthe ring.\r\n\r\nThe Dusky Ring is now recognised as a permanent feature of Saturn, but\r\nhow far it used to be permanent, or how long it has been so, is a matter\r\nwrapped in doubt. Recorded observations by Picard in 1673, and by Hadley\r\nin 1723, made of course with telescopes infinitely less powerful than\r\nthose of the present day, seem to suggest that both the observers named\r\nsaw the Dusky Ring, without, however, being able to form a clear\r\nconception that it was a ring. It is strange that during the long period\r\nfrom 1723 to 1838, no one—not even Sir W. Herschel, with his various\r\ntelescopes—should have obtained or at least have recorded any suspicion\r\nof its existence. There is, however, direct evidence that the Dusky Ring\r\nis wider and less faint than formerly. This was directly confirmed by\r\nCarpenter in 1863, who says he saw it “nearly as bright as the\r\nilluminated ring, so much so, that it might easily have been mistaken\r\nfor a part of it.” In 1883, Davidson found a marked difference in the\r\nbrilliancy of the two ends (_ansæ_) of the ring.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 Barnard was fortunate enough to observe an eclipse of one of\r\nSaturn’s satellites by the ring, but the eclipse, that is the\r\nconcealment of the satellite, was only effected when it passed behind\r\nthe bright rings; the dusky ring did not obliterate it, and hence there\r\nwas obtained a conclusive proof of the transparency of the dusky ring.\r\nBarnard further concluded from his observations that there was no\r\nseparating space or division between the inner bright ring and the dusky\r\nring, as has frequently been represented in drawings. This transparency\r\nof the Dusky Ring, as a matter of fact, is therefore undoubted; yet what\r\nare we to consider to be the meaning of an observation by Wray in 1861,\r\nthat whilst looking at the dusky ring edgeways the impression was\r\nconveyed to his eye that that ring was very much thicker than the bright\r\nrings?\r\n\r\nA very interesting question which has been much discussed has reference\r\nto the stability of the rings. It is generally agreed that the\r\nconstituent particles of the rings must be in motion round the primary\r\nor their equilibrium could not be maintained: almost equally certain is\r\nit, and for the like reason, that the rings cannot be solid. Of actual\r\nchange in the rings as regards their dimensions, we have no satisfactory\r\nproof, though authorities differ on the point, some thinking that the\r\nrings are expanding inwards, so that ultimately they will come into\r\ncontact with the ball, whilst others consider no proof whatever of such\r\nchange can be obtained from any of the observations yet made in the way\r\nof measurements.\r\n\r\nWe must now proceed to consider the satellites of Saturn. These are 8 in\r\nnumber, 7 of which move in orbits whose planes coincide nearly with the\r\nplanet’s equator, whilst the remaining one is inclined about 12°\r\nthereto. One consequence of this coincidence in the planes of these\r\nsatellites, which, it should be stated, are the 7 innermost, is that\r\nthey are always visible to the inhabitants of both hemispheres when they\r\nare not actually undergoing eclipse in the shadow of Saturn. The\r\nsatellites are of various sizes, and succeed one another in the\r\nfollowing order, reckoning from the nearest, outwards:—Mimas, Enceladus,\r\nTethys, Dione, Rhea, Titan, Hyperion and Iapetus. Any good 2-inch\r\ntelescope will show Titan; a 3-inch will sometimes show Iapetus; a\r\n4-inch will show Iapetus well, together with Rhea and Dione, but hardly\r\nTethys; all the others require large telescopes. If Saturn has any\r\ninhabitants at all constituted like ourselves, which is highly\r\nimprobable, they will have a chance of seeing celestial phenomena of the\r\ngreatest interest. What with the rings surrounding the planet and 8\r\nmoons in constant motion, there will be an endless succession of\r\nastronomical sights for them to study. The amount of light received from\r\nthe Sun cannot be much—barely 1/100th what the earth receives. The ring\r\nand satellites will therefore be useful as supplementary sources of\r\nlight; yet the satellites will not furnish much, for it has been\r\ncalculated that the surface of the sky occupied by all the satellites\r\nput together would to a dweller on Saturn only amount to 6 times the\r\narea of the sky covered by our Moon; whilst the intrinsic brightness of\r\nall put together would be no more than 1/16th part of the light which we\r\nreceive from our Moon.\r\n\r\nThe only physical fact worth noting here in connection with the\r\nsatellites concerns Iapetus. Cassini two centuries ago with his\r\nindifferent telescopes thought he had ascertained that this satellite\r\nwas subject to considerable variations of brilliancy. Sir W. Herschel\r\nconfirmed Cassini as to this. He found that it was much less brilliant\r\nwhen traversing the eastern half of its orbit than at other times. Two\r\nconclusions have been drawn from this fact. One is that the satellite\r\nrotates once on its axis in the same time that it performs one\r\nrevolution round its primary; and that there are portions of its surface\r\nwhich are almost entirely incapable of reflecting the rays of the Sun.\r\nThis last named supposition may perhaps be well founded, but the former\r\nneeds more proof than is as yet forthcoming. Iapetus on the whole may be\r\nsaid to shine as a star of the 9th magnitude. To this it may be added\r\nthat Titan is of the 8th magnitude, but all the others much smaller.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.—Saturn with the shadow of Titan on it, March 11,\r\n1892 (Terby).]\r\n\r\nSaturn revolves round the Sun in a little under 29½ years at a mean\r\ndistance of 886 millions of miles. Its apparent diameter varies between\r\n15″ and 20″; its true diameter may be put at 75,000 miles. The\r\nflattening of the poles, or “polar compression” as it is called, is\r\ngreater than that of any other planet, but is usually less noticeable\r\nthan in the case of Jupiter, because the ring is apt to distract the\r\neye, except when near the edgeways phase. The compression may be taken\r\nat 1/9.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n                                URANUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the Ancients Saturn was the outermost planet of the System, nothing\r\nbeyond it being known. Nor indeed was it to be assumed that any more\r\ncould possibly exist, because Mercury, Venus, the Earth, Mars, Jupiter,\r\nand Saturn, with the Sun, made 7 celestial bodies of prime importance;\r\nand 7 was the number of perfection; and there was thus provided one\r\ncelestial body to give a name to each of the days of the week.\r\n\r\nBut Science is not sentimental; and when men of Science come upon what\r\nlooks like a discovery they do their best to bring their discovery to a\r\nsuccessful issue, however much people’s prejudices may seem to stand in\r\nthe way at the moment.\r\n\r\nOn a certain evening in March, 1781, Sir William Herschel, then\r\ngradually coming into notice as a practical astronomer, was engaged in\r\nlooking at different fields of stars in the constellation Gemini when he\r\nlighted on one which at once attracted his special attention. Altering\r\nhis eyepiece, and substituting a higher magnifying power he found the\r\napparent size of the mysterious object enlarged, which conclusively\r\nproved that it was not a star; for it is a well-known optical property\r\nof all stars that whatever be the size of telescope employed on them,\r\nand however high the magnifying power no definite disc of light can be\r\nobtained when in focus. Herschel’s new find, therefore, was plainly not\r\na star, and no idea having in those days come into men’s minds of there\r\nbeing any new planets awaiting discovery, he announced as a matter of\r\ncourse that he had found a new comet, so soon as he ascertained that the\r\nnew body was in motion. The announcement was not made to the Royal\r\nSociety till April 26, more than six weeks after the date of the actual\r\ndiscovery, an indication, by the way, of the dilatory circulation of\r\nnews a hundred years ago. The supposed comet was observed by Maskelyne,\r\nthe Astronomer Royal, four days after Herschel had first seen it, and\r\nMaskelyne seems to have at once got the idea into his head that he was\r\nlooking at a planet and not at a comet. As soon as possible after the\r\ndiscovery of a new comet the practice of astronomers is to endeavour to\r\ndetermine what is the shape of the orbit which it is pursuing. All\r\nattempts to carry out this in the case of Herschel’s supposed new comet\r\nproved abortive, because it was found impossible to harmonise, except\r\nfor a short period of time, the movements of the new body with the form\r\nof curve usually affected by most comets, namely, the parabola. It is\r\ntrue, as we shall see later on in speaking of comets, that a certain\r\nnumber of those bodies do revolve in the closed curve known as the\r\nellipse, but it is usual to calculate the parabolic form first of all,\r\nbecause it is the easier to calculate; and to persevere with it until it\r\nplainly appears that the parabola will not fit in with the observed\r\nmovements of the new object. This practice was carried out in the case\r\nof Herschel’s new body, and it was eventually found that not only was\r\nits orbit not parabolic; that not only was its orbit not an elongated\r\nellipse of the kind affected by comets; but that it was nearly a circle,\r\nand as the body itself showed a defined disc the conclusion was\r\ninevitable: it was in real truth a new planet. It has not taken long to\r\nwrite this statement, and it will take still less time for the reader to\r\nread what has been written, but the result just mentioned occupied the\r\nattention of astronomers many months in working out, step by step, in\r\nsuch a way as to make sure that no mistake had been made.\r\n\r\nWhen it was once clearly determined that Herschel had added a new planet\r\nto the list of known planets it became an interesting matter of inquiry\r\nto find out whether it had ever been seen before; and to settle the name\r\nit should bear. A little research soon showed that the new planet had\r\nbeen seen and recorded as a fixed star by various observers on 20\r\nprevious occasions, beginning as far back as Dec. 13, 1690, when\r\nFlamstead registered at Greenwich as a star. These various observations,\r\nspread over a period of 91 years, and all recorded by observers of skill\r\nand eminence materially helped astronomers in their efforts to calculate\r\naccurately the shape and nature of the new planet’s orbit. One observer,\r\na Frenchman named Le Monnier, saw the planet no less than 12 times\r\nbetween 1750 and 1771, and if he had had (which it is known he had not)\r\nan orderly and methodical mind, the glory of this discovery would have\r\nbeen lost to England and obtained by France. Arago has left it on record\r\nthat he was once shown one of these chance observations of Uranus, which\r\nhad been recorded by Le Monnier on an old paper bag in which hair powder\r\nhad been sold by a perfumer.\r\n\r\nA long discussion took place on the question of a name for the new\r\nplanet. Bode’s suggestion of “Uranus” is now in universal use, but it is\r\nwithin the recollection of many persons living that this planet bore\r\nsometimes the name of the “Georgium Sidus” and sometimes the name of\r\n“Herschel.” The former designation was proposed by Herschel himself in\r\ncompliment to his sovereign and patron George III. of England; whilst a\r\nFrench astronomer suggested the latter name. However, neither of these\r\nappellations was acceptable to the astronomers of the Continent, who\r\ndeclared in favour of a mythological name, though it was a long time\r\nbefore they agreed to accept Bode’s “Uranus.” The symbol commonly used\r\nto represent the planet is formed of Herschel’s initial with a little\r\ncircle added below, though the Germans employ something else, “made in\r\nGermany,” to quote a too familiar phrase.\r\n\r\nThe visible disc of Uranus is so small that none but telescopes of the\r\nvery largest size can make anything of it. A few sentences therefore\r\nwill dispose of this part of the subject. The disc is usually bluish in\r\ntinge, and most observers who look at it consider it uniformly bright,\r\nbut there is satisfactory testimony to the effect that under the most\r\nfavourable circumstances of instrument and atmosphere two or more belts,\r\nnot unlike the belts of Jupiter, may be traced. From the position in\r\nwhich these belts have been seen it is inferred that the satellites of\r\nUranus (presently to be mentioned) are unusually much inclined to the\r\nplanet’s equator, and revolve in a retrograde direction, contrary to\r\nwhat is the ordinary rule of the planets and satellites. It is assumed\r\nas the basis of these ideas, (and by analogy it is reasonable to do\r\nthis) that the belts are practically parallel to the planet’s equator,\r\nand at right angles to the planet’s axis of rotation. To speak of the\r\nplanet’s axis of rotation is, in one sense, another assumption, because\r\navailable observations can scarcely be said to enable us to demonstrate\r\nthat the planet does rotate on its axis, yet we can have no moral doubt\r\nabout it. Taylor has suggested grounds for the opinion that “there can\r\nbe very little doubt that Uranus is to a very large extent\r\nself-luminous, and that we do not see it wholly by reflected light.” To\r\nthis Gore adds the idea that there is “strong evidence in favour of the\r\nexistence of intrinsic heat in the planet.”\r\n\r\nUranus is attended by several satellites. It was once thought that there\r\nwere eight, of which six were due to Sir W. Herschel, the other two\r\nbeing of modern discovery. Astronomers are, however, now agreed that no\r\nmore than four satellites can justly be recognised as known to exist,\r\nand they are so minute in size that only the very largest telescopes\r\nwill show them; and therefore our knowledge of them is extremely\r\nlimited. Sir W. Herschel’s idea that he had seen six satellites appears\r\nto have resulted from his having on some occasions mistaken some very\r\nsmall stars for satellites. Two only of his six are thought to have been\r\nreal satellites. The other two recognised satellites were found both in\r\n1847, one by Lassell, and the other by O. Struve.\r\n\r\nUranus revolves round the Sun in rather more than 84 years, at a mean\r\ndistance of 1781 millions of miles. Its apparent diameter, seen from the\r\nEarth, does not vary much from 3½″ which corresponds to about 31,000\r\nmiles. It has been calculated that the light received from the Sun by\r\nUranus would be about the amount furnished by 300 full Moons seen by us\r\non the Earth, though another authority increases this to 1670 full\r\nMoons. From Uranus Saturn can be seen, and perhaps Jupiter, both as\r\ninferior planets, just as we see Venus and Mercury; but all the other\r\ninner planets, including Mars and the Earth, would be hopelessly lost to\r\nview, because perpetually too close to the Sun. Possibly, however, they\r\nmight, on rare occasions, be seen in transit across the Sun’s disc.\r\nNeptune, of course, would be visible and be the only superior planet.\r\nThe Sun itself would appear to an observer on Uranus as a very bright\r\nstar, with a disc of 1¾′ of arc in diameter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n                                NEPTUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now come to the best known planet of the solar system, reckoning\r\noutwards from the Sun, and though this planet itself, as an object to\r\nlook at, has no particular interest for the general public, yet the\r\nhistory of its discovery is a matter of extreme interest. Moreover, it\r\nis very closely mixed up with the history of the planet Uranus, which\r\nhas just been described. After Uranus had become fully recognised as a\r\nregular member of the solar system, a French astronomer named Alexis\r\nBouvard set himself the task of exhaustively considering the movements\r\nof Uranus with a view of determining its orbit with the utmost possible\r\nexactness. His available materials ranged themselves in two groups:—the\r\nmodern observations between 1781 and 1820, and the early observations of\r\nFlamsteed, Bradley, Mayer, and Le Monnier, extending from 1690 to 1771.\r\nBouvard found in substance that he could frame an orbit which would fit\r\nin with each group of observations, but that he could not obtain an\r\norbit which would reconcile both sets of observations during the 130\r\nyears over which they jointly extended. He therefore rashly came to the\r\nconclusion that the earlier observations, having been made when methods\r\nand instruments were alike relatively imperfect, were probably\r\ninaccurate or otherwise untrustworthy, and had better be rejected. This\r\nseemed for awhile to solve the difficulty, and results which he\r\npublished in 1821 represented with all reasonable accuracy the then\r\nmovements of the planet. A very few years, however, sufficed to reveal\r\ndiscordances between observation and theory, so marked and regular as to\r\nmake it perfectly clear that it was not Bouvard’s work which was faulty\r\nbut that Uranus itself had gone astray through the operation of definite\r\nbut as yet unknown causes. What these causes were could only be a matter\r\nof surmise based upon the evident fact that there was some source of\r\ndisturbance which was evidently throwing Uranus out of its proper place\r\nand regular course. First one and then another astronomer gave attention\r\nand thought to the matter, and eventually the conclusion was arrived at\r\nthat there existed, more remote from the Sun than Uranus, an\r\nundiscovered planet which was able to make its influence felt by\r\nderanging the movements of Uranus in its ordinary journey round the Sun\r\nevery 84 years. This conclusion on the part of astronomers becoming\r\nknown, a young Cambridge student, then at St. John’s College, John Couch\r\nAdams by name, resolved, in July 1841, to take up the subject, though it\r\nwas not until 1843 that he actually did so. The problem to be solved was\r\nto suggest the precise place in the sky at a given time of an imaginary\r\nplanet massive enough to push, or pull, out of its normal place the\r\nplanet Uranus, which was evidently being pushed at one time and pulled\r\nat another. It would also be part of the problem to predict the distance\r\nfrom the Sun of the planet thus imagined to exist. Adams worked\r\npatiently and silently at this very profound and difficult problem for\r\n1¾ years when he found himself able to forward to Airy, who had become\r\nAstronomer Royal after being a Cambridge Professor, some provisional\r\nelements of an imaginary planet of a size, at a distance, and in a\r\nposition to meet the circumstances. It is greatly to be regretted, on\r\nmore grounds than one, that Airy did nothing but pigeon-hole Adams’s\r\npapers. Had he done what might have been, and probably was, expected,\r\nthat is, had he made them public, or better still had he made telescopic\r\nuse of them, a long and unpleasant international controversy would have\r\nbeen avoided, and Adams would not have been robbed in part of the\r\nwell-deserved fruits of his protracted labours.\r\n\r\nWe must now turn to consider something that was happening in France. In\r\nthe summer of 1845, just before Adams had finished his work, and one and\r\na half years after he commenced it a young Frenchman, who afterwards\r\nrose to great eminence, U. J. J. Le Verrier, turned his attention to the\r\nmovements of Uranus with a view of ascertaining the cause of their\r\nrecognised irregularity. In November 1845 he made public the conclusion\r\nthat those irregularities did not exclusively depend upon Jupiter or\r\nSaturn. He followed this up in June 1846 by a second memoir to prove\r\nthat an unknown exterior planet was the cause of all the trouble, and he\r\nassigned evidence as to its position very much as Adams had done 8\r\nmonths previously. Airy on receiving a copy of Le Verrier’s memoir seems\r\nso far, at last, to have been roused that he took the trouble to compare\r\nLe Verrier’s conclusions with those of Adams so long in his possession\r\nneglected. Finding that a remarkably close accord existed between the\r\nconclusions of the two men, he came to realise that both must be of\r\nvalue, and he wrote a fortnight later to suggest to Professor Challis\r\nthe desirability of his instituting a search for the suspected planet.\r\nChallis began within two days, but was handicapped by not having in his\r\npossession any map of the stars in the neighbourhood suggested as the\r\n_locale_ of the planet. He lost no time however in making such a map,\r\nbut, of course, the doing so caused an appreciable delay, and it was not\r\nuntil September 29, 1846, that he found an object which excited his\r\nsuspicions and eventually proved to be the planet sought for. It was\r\nsubsequently ascertained that the planet had been recorded as a star on\r\nAugust 4 and 12, and that the star of August 12 was missing from the\r\nzone observed on July 30. The discovery of the planet was therefore just\r\nmissed on August 12 because the results of each evening’s work were not\r\nadequately compared with what had gone before.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile things had not been standing still in France. In August 1846,\r\nLe Verrier published a third memoir intended to develope information\r\nrespecting the probable position of the planet in the heavens. In\r\nSeptember 23 a summary of this third memoir was received by Encke at\r\nBerlin, accompanied by the request that he would cooperate\r\ninstrumentally in the search for it. Encke at once directed two of his\r\nassistants named D’Arrest and Galle to do this, and they were\r\nfortunately well circumstanced for the task. Unlike Challis, who, as we\r\nhave seen, could do nothing until he had made a map for himself, the\r\nBerlin observers had one ready to hand, which by good chance had just\r\nbeen published by the Berlin Academy for the part of the heavens which\r\nboth Adams and Le Verrier assigned as the probable locality in which the\r\nanxiously desired planet would be found. Galle called out the visible\r\nstars one by one whilst D’Arrest checked them by the map, and suddenly\r\nhe came upon an unmarked object which at the moment looked like an 8th\r\nmagnitude star. The following night showed that the suspicious object\r\nwas in motion, and it was soon ascertained to be the trans-Uranian\r\nplanet which was being searched for. The discovery when announced\r\nexcited the liveliest interest all over the world. It did more; it\r\ncreated a bitter feeling of resentment on the part of French astronomers\r\nthat the laurels claimed by them should have been also claimed in an\r\nequal share by a young and unknown Englishman, and accordingly the old\r\ncry of “_perfide Albion_” arose on all sides. I have been particular in\r\nstating the various dates which belong to this narrative, in order to\r\nmake as clear as possible the facts of the case. This is even now\r\nnecessary, because though the astronomers of England and Germany are\r\nwilling to give Adams and Le Verrier each their fair share of this great\r\ndiscovery, the same impartial spirit is not to be found in France, for\r\nnothing is more common, even in the present day, in looking at French\r\nbooks of astronomy, than to find Adams’s name either glossed over or\r\nabsolutely suppressed altogether when the planet Neptune is under\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nHow remarkable a discovery this was, will perhaps be realized, when it\r\nis stated that Adams was only 2½° out in assigning the position of the\r\nnew planet, whilst Le Verrier was even nearer, being barely 1° out.\r\n\r\nWe know practically nothing respecting the physical appearance of\r\nNeptune, owing to its immense distance from us, and for the like reason\r\nthe Neptunian astronomers, if there are any, will know absolutely\r\nnothing about the Earth; indeed, their knowledge of the Solar System\r\nwill be restricted to Uranus, Saturn, and the Sun. Even the Sun will\r\nonly have an apparent diameter of about 1′ of arc, and, therefore, will\r\nonly seem to be a very bright star, yielding light equal in amount,\r\naccording to Zöllner, to about 700 full moons. There is one satellite\r\nbelonging to Neptune, and as this has been calculated to exhibit a disc\r\n10° in diameter, a certain amount of light will no doubt be afforded by\r\nit especially if, as is not unlikely, Neptune is itself possessed of\r\nsome inherent luminosity independently of the Sun.\r\n\r\nThe fact that Neptune seems destitute of visible spots or belts, results\r\nin our being ignorant of the period of its axial rotation, though it\r\nshould be stated that in 1883, Maxwell Hall in Jamaica, observed\r\nperiodical fluctuations in its light, which he thought implied that the\r\nplanet rotated on its axis in rather less than 8 hours. Several\r\nobservers thought 20 or 30 years ago, that they had noticed indications\r\nof Neptune being surrounded by a ring like Saturn’s ring, but the\r\nevidence as to this is very inconclusive. It is quite certain that none\r\nbut the very largest telescopes in the world would show any such\r\nappendage, and this planet seems to have been neglected of late years,\r\nby the possessors of such telescopes. Moreover, if a ring existed it\r\nwould only open out to its full extent once in every 82 years, being the\r\nhalf of the period of the planet’s revolution round the Sun (just as\r\nSaturn’s ring only opens out to the fullest extent every 14½ years), so\r\nthat, obviously, supposing suspicions of a ring dating back 30 or 40\r\nyears were well founded, it might well be that another 30 or 40 years\r\nmight need to elapse, before astronomers would be in a position to see\r\ntheir suspicions revive.\r\n\r\nNeptune revolves round the Sun in 164½ years, at a mean distance of 2791\r\nmillions of miles. Its apparent diameter scarcely varies from 2¾″. Its\r\ntrue diameter is about 37,000 miles. No compression of the Poles is\r\nperceptible. Its one satellite revolves round Neptune in 5¾ days, and in\r\na retrograde direction, at a mean distance of 223,000 miles, and shines\r\nas a star of the 14th magnitude. This is a peculiarity which it only\r\nshares with the satellites of Uranus, so far as it regards the planetary\r\nmembers of the Solar System, though there are many retrograde Comets.\r\n\r\nThe question has often been mooted, whether there exists, and belonging\r\nto the Solar System, a planet farther off than Neptune. There does seem\r\nsome evidence of this, as we shall better understand, when we come to\r\nthe subject of long-period Comets, though it cannot be said that much\r\nprogress has yet been made in arriving at a solution of the problem.\r\n\r\nUnless there does exist a trans-Neptunian planet, a Neptunian astronomer\r\nwill know very little about planets, for Uranus and Saturn will alone be\r\nvisible to him. Both will of course be what we call “inferior planets,”\r\nand under the best of circumstances will cut a poor figure in the\r\nNeptunian sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n                                COMETS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI suppose that it is the experience of all those who happen to be in any\r\nsense, however humble, specialists in a certain branch of science, that\r\nfrom time to time, they are beset with questions on the part of their\r\nfriends respecting those particular matters which it is known that they\r\nhave specially studied. There is no fault to be found with this thirst\r\nfor information, always supposing that it is kept within due bounds; but\r\nmy motive for alluding to it here, is to see whether any well-marked\r\nconclusion can be drawn from it, within my own knowledge as regards\r\nastronomical facts or events. Now in the case of the science of\r\nastronomy (for which in this connection I, for the moment, will venture\r\nto speak), there is certainly no one department which so unfailingly, at\r\nall times and in all places, seems to evoke such popular sympathy and\r\ninterest as the department which deals with Comets.\r\n\r\nSun-spots may come and go; bright planets may shine more brightly; the\r\nSun or Moon may be obscured by eclipses; temporary stars may burst\r\nforth,—all these things are within the ken of the general public by\r\nmeans of newspapers or almanacs, but it is a comet which evokes more\r\nquestionings and conversations than all the other matters just referred\r\nto put together. When a new and bright comet appears, or even when any\r\ncomet not very bright gets talked about, the old question is still fresh\r\nand verdant—“Is there any danger to the Earth to be apprehended from\r\ncollision with a Comet?” followed by “What is a Comet?” “What is it made\r\nof?” “Has it ever appeared before?” “Will it come back again?” and so\r\non. Questions in this strain have more often than I can tell of been put\r\nto me. They seem the stock questions of all who will condescend to\r\nreplace for five minutes in the day the newest novel or the pending\r\nparliamentary election.\r\n\r\nIt may be taken as a fact (though in no proper sense a rule) that a\r\nbright and conspicuous comet comes about once in 10 years, and a very\r\nremarkable comet every 30 years. Thus we have had during the present\r\ncentury bright comets in 1811, 1825, 1835, 1843, 1858, 1861, 1874 and\r\n1882, whereof those of 1811, 1843, and 1858 were specially celebrated.\r\nTested then by either standard of words “bright and conspicuous,” or\r\n“specially celebrated,” it may be affirmed that a good comet is now due,\r\nso let us prepare for it by getting up the subject in advance.\r\n\r\nI will not attempt to answer in regular order or in any set form the\r\nquestions which I have just mentioned as being stock questions, but they\r\nwill be answered in substance as we go along. There is one matter in\r\nconnection with comets which has deeply impressed itself upon the public\r\nmind, and that is the presence or absence of a “tail.” It is not too\r\nmuch to say that the generality of people regard the tail of a comet as\r\n_the_ comet; and that though an object may be a true comet from an\r\nastronomer’s point of view, yet if it has no tail its claims go for\r\nnought with the mass of mankind. We have here probably a remnant of\r\nancient thought, especially of that line of thought which in bygone\r\ntimes associated Comets universally with the idea that they were\r\nespecially sent to be portents of national disasters of one kind or\r\nanother. This is brought out by numberless ancient authors, and by none\r\nmore forcibly than Shakespeare. Hence we have such passages as the\r\nfollowing in _Julius Cæsar_ (Act ii., sc. 2):—\r\n\r\n  “When beggars die there are no comets seen,\r\n  The Heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.”\r\n\r\nIn _Henry VI._ (Part I., Act i., sc. 1) we find the well-known passage:—\r\n\r\n  “Comets importing change of times and states\r\n  Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,\r\n  And with them scourge the bad revolting stars\r\n  That have consented unto Henry’s death.”\r\n\r\nThere are in point of fact two distinct ideas evolved here: (1) that\r\ncomets are prophetic of evil, and (2) stars potential for evil.\r\n\r\nThere is another passage in _Henry VI_. (Part I., Act iii., sc. 3) even\r\nmore pronounced:—\r\n\r\n  “Now shine it like a Comet of revenge,\r\n  A prophet to the fall of all our foes.”\r\n\r\nAgain; in _Hamlet_ (Act i., sc. 1) we find:—\r\n\r\n  “As stars with trains of fire, and dews of blood,\r\n  Disasters in the Sun.”\r\n\r\nOnce more; in the _Taming of the Shrew_ (Act iii., sc. 2) we have the\r\nmore general, but still emphatic enough, idea expressed by the simple\r\nwords of reference to—\r\n\r\n  “Some Comet or unusual prodigy.”\r\n\r\nShakespeare may be said to have lived at the epoch when astrology was in\r\nhigh favour, and it may be that he only gave utterance to the current\r\nopinion prevalent among all classes in those still somewhat “Dark Ages”\r\n(so called). This, however, can hardly be said of the author of my next\r\nquotation—John Milton (_Paradise Lost_, bk. II.):—\r\n\r\n                            “Satan stood\r\n  Unterrified, and like a Comet burned,\r\n  That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge\r\n  In th’ Arctic sky, and from its horrid hair\r\n  Shakes pestilence and war.”\r\n\r\nJumping over a century we find the ancient theory still in vogue, or\r\nThomson (_Seasons_, Summer) would never have written:—\r\n\r\n                  “Amid the radiant orbs\r\n  That more than deck, that animate the sky,\r\n  The life-infusing suns of other worlds;\r\n  Lo! from the dread immensity of space,\r\n  Returning with accelerated course,\r\n  The rushing comet to the sun descends;\r\n  And, as he sinks below the shading earth,\r\n  With awful train projected o’er the heavens,\r\n  The guilty nations tremble.”\r\n\r\nEven Napoleon I. had servile flatterers who, as late as 1808, tried to\r\nextract astrological influence out of a comet by way of bolstering up\r\n“Old Bony.” But enough of poetry and fiction, let us hasten back to\r\nprosaic fact.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.—Telescope Comet with a nucleus.]\r\n\r\nComets as objects to look at may be classed under three forms, though\r\nthe same comet may undergo such changes as will at different epochs in\r\nits career cause it to put on each variety of form in succession. Thus\r\nthe comet of 1825 seen during that year as a brilliant naked-eye object,\r\nafter being lost in the sun’s rays, was again found on April 2, 1826 by\r\nPons. Lamentable were his cries at the miserable plight it was in. He\r\ndescribed it as totally destroyed: without tail, beard, coma or nucleus,\r\na mere spectre. The simplest form of comet is a mere nebulous mass,\r\nalmost always circular, or perhaps a little oval, in outline. It may\r\nmaintain this appearance throughout its visibility; or, growing brighter\r\nmay become a comet of the second class, with a central condensation,\r\nwhich developing becomes a “nucleus” or head. It may retain this feature\r\nfor the rest of its career, or may pass into the third class and throw\r\nout a “coma” or beard, which will perhaps develop into a tail or tails.\r\nDoing this it will not unfrequently grow bright enough and large enough\r\nto become visible to the naked eye. In exceptional cases the nucleus\r\nwill become as bright as a 2nd or even 1st magnitude star, and the tail\r\nmay acquire a length of several or many degrees. In the last named case\r\nof all the comet becomes, _par excellence_ according to the popular\r\nsentiment, “a comet.” It will now be readily inferred that the\r\nastronomer in his observatory has to do with many comets which the\r\npublic at large never hear of, or if they do hear of, treat with\r\ncontempt, because they are destitute of tails.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.—Wells’s Comet of 1882, seen in full daylight\r\nnear the Sun on Sept. 18.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.—Quenisset’s Comet, July 9, 1893 (Quenisset).]\r\n\r\nThe tails of comets exhibit very great varieties not only of size but of\r\nform; some are long and slender; some are long and much spread out\r\ntowards their ends, like quill pens, for instance; some are short and\r\nstumpy, mere tufts or excrescences rather than tails. Not unfrequently a\r\ntail seems to consist of two parallel rays with no cometary matter, or\r\nit may be only a very slight amount of cometary matter traceable in the\r\ninterspace; some have one main tail consisting of a pair of rays such as\r\njust described, together with one or more subsidiary or off-shoot tails.\r\nThe comet of 1825 had five tails and the comet of 1744 had six tails. It\r\nmight be inferred from all this that the tails of comets are so\r\nexceedingly irregular, uncertain and casual as to be amenable to no\r\nlaws. This was long considered to be the case; but a Russian observer\r\nnamed Bredichin, as the result of much study and research, has arrived\r\nat the conclusion that all comet tails may be brought under one or other\r\nof three types; and that each type is indicative of certain distinct\r\ndifferences of origin and condition which he considers himself able to\r\ndefine. The first type comprises tails which are long and straight;\r\n“they are formed” (to quote Young’s statement of Bredichin’s views) “of\r\nmatter upon which the Sun’s repulsive action is from twelve to fifteen\r\ntimes as great as the gravitational attraction, so that the particles\r\nleave the comet with a relative velocity of at least four or five miles\r\na second; and this velocity is continually increased as they recede,\r\nuntil at last it becomes enormous, the particles travelling several\r\nmillions of miles in a day. The straight rays which are seen in the\r\nfigure of the tail of Donati’s Comet, tangential to the tail, are\r\nstreamers of this first type; as also was the enormous tail of the comet\r\nof 1861. The second type is the curved plume-like train, like the\r\nprincipal tail of Donati’s Comet. In this type the repulsive force\r\nvaries from 2.2 times gravity (for the particles on the convex edge of\r\nthe tail) to half that amount for those which form the inner edge. This\r\nis by far the most common type of cometary train. A few comets show\r\ntails of the third type—short, stubby, brushes violently curved, and due\r\nto matter of which the repulsive force is only a fraction of\r\ngravity—from 1/10 to ½.”\r\n\r\nBredichin wishes it to be inferred that the tails of the 1st type are\r\nprobably composed of hydrogen; those of the 2nd type of some\r\nhydro-carbon gas; and those of the 3rd of the vapour of iron, probably\r\nwith some admixture of sodium and other substances. Bredichin, as a\r\nreason for these conclusions, supposes that the force which generates\r\nthe tails of comets is a repulsive force, with a surface action the same\r\nfor equal surfaces of any kind of matter; the effective accelerating\r\nforce therefore measured by the velocity which it would produce would\r\ndepend upon the ratio of surface to mass in the particles acted upon,\r\nand so, in his view, should be inversely proportional to their molecular\r\nweights. Now it happens that the molecular weights of hydrogen, of\r\nhydro-carbon gases, and of the vapour of iron bear to each other just\r\nabout the required proportion.\r\n\r\nI am here stating the views and opinions of others without definitely\r\nprofessing to be satisfied with them, but as they have met with some\r\nacceptance, it is proper to chronicle them, though we know nothing of\r\nthe nature of the repulsive force here talked about. It might be\r\nelectric, it might be anything. The spectroscope certainly lends some\r\ncountenance to Bredichin’s views, but we need far more knowledge and\r\nstudy of comets before we shall be justly entitled to dogmatise on the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.—Holmes’s Comet, Nov. 9, 1892 (Denning).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 23.—Holmes’s Comet, Nov. 16, 1892 (Denning).]\r\n\r\nThis has been rather a digression. I go back now to prosaic matters of\r\nfact, of which a vast and interesting array present themselves for\r\nconsideration in connection with comets. Let us consider a little in\r\ndetail what they are, to look at. We have seen that a well-developed\r\ncomet of the normal type usually comprises a nucleus, a head or coma,\r\nand a tail. Comets which have no tails generally exhibit heads of very\r\nsimple structure; and if there is a nucleus, the nucleus is little else\r\nthan a stellar point of light. But in the case of the larger comets,\r\nwhich are almost or quite visible to the naked eye, the head often\r\nexhibits a very complex structure, which in not a few cases seems to\r\nconvey very definite indications of the operations going on at the time.\r\nFigs. 22 and 23 may be taken as samples of a complex cometary head,\r\nthough no two comets resemble one another exactly in details. Fig. 24\r\nforcibly conveys the idea that we are looking at a process of\r\ndevelopment analogous to an uprush of water from a fountain, or perhaps\r\nI might better say, from a burst waterpipe. There is a distinct idea of\r\na jet. This self-same idea, in another form, presents itself in the case\r\nof those comets which exhibit what astronomers are in the habit of\r\ncalling “luminous envelopes.” The jet in this case is not strictly a jet\r\nbecause it is not a continuous outflow, or overflow, of matter; the idea\r\nrather suggests itself of an intermittent overflow resulting in\r\naccumulated layers, or strata, of matter becoming visible. But with this\r\nwe come to a standstill; we cannot tell where the matter comes from, and\r\nstill less, where it goes to; we can only record what our eyes, assisted\r\nby telescopes, tell us. There can, however, I think, be no doubt that\r\nthe matter of a comet becomes displayed to our senses as the result of a\r\nprocess of expulsion, or repulsion, from the nucleus; and then, having\r\nbecome launched into space, it comes under the influence, also\r\nrepulsive, of the Sun. All these things are visible facts. As to causes,\r\nwe suggest little, because we know so little. Anyone who has seen a\r\ncomet and has watched the displays of jets and luminous envelopes, such\r\nas I have endeavoured to set forth, will realise at once how impossible\r\nit is to describe these things in words. They must be seen either in\r\nactual being or in picture. Some further allusions to this branch of the\r\nsubject may perhaps be more advantageously made after we have considered\r\nthe movements and orbits of comets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 24.—Comet III. of 1862, on Aug 22, showing jet of\r\nluminous matter (Challis).]\r\n\r\nThere is often a slight general resemblance between a planet and a\r\ncomet, as regards the path which each class of body pursues. Probably\r\nthe least reflective person likely to be following me here understands\r\nthe bare fact, that all the planets revolve round the Sun, and are held\r\nto defined orbits by the Sun’s influence, or attraction, as it is\r\ncalled. Perhaps, it is not equally realised, that in a somewhat similar,\r\nbut not quite the same way, comets are influenced and controlled by the\r\nSun.\r\n\r\nComets must be considered as regards their motions to be divisible into\r\ntwo classes:—(1) Those which belong to the Solar System; and (2) those\r\nwhich do not. Each of these two classes must again be sub-divided, if we\r\nwould really obtain a just conception of how things stand.\r\n\r\nBy the Comets which belong to the Sun, I mean those which revolve round\r\nthe Sun in closed orbits;[5] and are, or may be, seen again and again at\r\nrecurring intervals. There are 2 or 3 dozen comets which present\r\nthemselves to our gaze at stated intervals, varying from about 3 to 70\r\nyears. There are again other comets which without any doubt\r\n(mathematically) are revolving round the Sun in closed orbits, but in\r\norbits so large and with periods of revolution so long (often many\r\ncenturies), that though they will return again to the sight of the\r\ninhabitants of the earth some day, yet no second return having been\r\nactually recorded, the astronomer’s prediction that they will return,\r\nremains at present a prediction based on mathematics but nothing more.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of Comet of which we see examples from time to\r\ntime, and having seen them once shall never see again. This is because\r\nthese Comets move in orbits which are not closed, and which are known as\r\nparabolic or hyperbolic orbits respectively, because derived from those\r\nsections of a cone which are called the Parabola and the Hyperbola. It\r\nmust be understood that what I am now referring to is purely a matter of\r\norbit, and that no relationship subsists between the size and physical\r\nfeatures of a Comet and the path it pursues in space. The only sort of\r\nreservation, perhaps, to be made to this statement is, that the comets\r\ncelebrated for their size and brilliancy, are often found to be\r\nrevolving in elliptic orbits of great eccentricity, which means that\r\ntheir periods may amount to many centuries.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to say something now as to what is the ordinary career of\r\na comet, so far as visibility to us, the inhabitants of the Earth, is\r\nconcerned. Though this might be illustrated by reference to the history\r\nof many comets, perhaps there is no one more suitable for the purpose\r\nthan Donati’s Comet of 1858. In former times, when telescopes were few\r\nor non-existent, brilliant comets often appeared very suddenly, just as\r\na carriage or a man does, as you turn the corner of a street. Such\r\nthings even happen still: for instance, the great comet of 1861 burst\r\nupon us all at once at a day’s notice. Usually, however, now in\r\nconsequence of the large size of the telescopes in use, and the great\r\nnumber of observers who are incessantly on the watch, comets are\r\ndiscovered when they are very small, because remote both from the Earth\r\nand Sun, and many weeks, or even months, it may be, before they shine\r\nforth in their ultimate splendour. Now, let us see how these statements\r\nare supported by the history of Donati’s comet in 1858. On June 2 in\r\nthat year, it was first seen by Donati at Florence, as a faint\r\nnebulosity, slowly journeying northwards. June passed away, and July,\r\nand August, the comet all the while remaining invisible to the naked\r\neye; that is to say, it first became perceptible to the naked eye on\r\nAugust 29, having put forth a faint tail about August 20. After the\r\nbeginning of September its brilliancy rapidly increased. On September\r\n17, the head equalled in brightness a 2nd magnitude star, the tail being\r\n4° long. Passing its point of nearest approach to the Sun on September\r\n29, it came nearest to the Earth on October 10; though, perhaps, its\r\nappearance a few days previously, namely on October 5, is the thing best\r\nremembered by those who saw it, because it was on that night that the\r\ncomet passed over the 1st magnitude star Arcturus. For several days\r\nabout this time, the comet was an object of striking beauty in the\r\nWestern Heavens, during the hours immediately after sun-set. After\r\nOctober 10, it rapidly passed away to the Southern hemisphere,\r\ndiminishing in brightness, as it did so, because receding from the Earth\r\nand the Sun. It continued its career through the winter; became\r\ninvisible to the naked eye; and finally invisible altogether in March\r\n1859. It remained in view, therefore, for more than nine months, not to\r\nreturn again till about the year 3158 A.D., for its period of revolution\r\nwas found to be about 2000 years.\r\n\r\nI have been particular in sketching somewhat fully the history of this\r\ncomet so far as we are concerned, because, as I have already said, it is\r\ntypical of the visible career of many comets. Halley’s comet in 1835 and\r\n1836, went through a somewhat similar series of changes. This comet—a\r\nwell-known periodical one of great historic interest and brilliancy—may\r\nbe commended to the younger members of the rising generation, because it\r\nis due to return again to these parts of space a few years hence, or in\r\n1910.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 25.—Sawerthal’s Comet, June 4, 1888 (Charlois).]\r\n\r\nWhat is a comet made of? Men of Science equally with the general public\r\nwould like to be able to answer this question, but they cannot do so\r\nwith satisfactory certainty. A great many years ago Sir John Herschel\r\nwrote thus:—“It seems impossible to avoid the following conclusion, that\r\nthe matter of the nucleus of a comet is powerfully excited and dilated\r\ninto a vaporous state by the action of the Sun’s rays escaping in\r\nstreams and jets at those points of its surface which oppose the least\r\nresistance, and in all probability throwing that surface or the nucleus\r\nitself into irregular motions by its reaction in the act of so escaping,\r\nand thus altering its direction.” This passage was written of course\r\nbefore the spectroscope had been brought to bear on the observations of\r\ncomets, but so far as Sir John Herschel’s remark implies the presence of\r\nvapour, that is gas, in a comet, the surmise has been amply borne out by\r\nlater discoveries. The fact that as a comet approaches the Sun some\r\nforces, no doubt of solar origin, come into operation to vaporise and\r\ntherefore expand the matter composing the comet is sufficiently shown by\r\nthe great developement which takes place as we have seen in the tails of\r\ncomets, but in regard to the heads of comets we are face to face with a\r\nstrange enigma. Though the tails expand the heads contract as the comet\r\napproaches its position of greatest proximity to the Sun. Having passed\r\nthis point the head expands again. This curious circumstance, first\r\npointed out by Kepler in 1618, has often been noticed since, and noticed\r\nindeed not as the result of mere eye impressions, but after careful\r\nmicrometrical measurement with suitable instruments. I think the\r\nconfession must be made that we are hopelessly ignorant of the nature of\r\ncomet’s except that gases are largely concerned in their constitution.\r\n\r\nIt seems impossible to doubt that some tails of comets are hollow\r\ncylinders or hollow cones. Such a theory would account for the fact, so\r\noften noticed, that single tails are usually much brighter at their two\r\nedges than at the centre. This is the natural effect of looking\r\ntransversely at any translucent cylinder of measureable thickness.\r\n\r\nIt was long a moot point whether comets are self-luminous, or whether\r\nthey shine by reflected light; but it is now generally admitted that\r\nwhilst a part of the light of a comet may be derived by reflection from\r\nthe Sun yet as a rule they must be regarded as shining by their own\r\nintrinsic light.\r\n\r\nIt should be stated here by way of caution that the observations on this\r\nsubject are not so consistent as one could wish, and it seems necessary\r\nto assume that all comets are not constituted alike, and that therefore\r\nwhat is true of one does not necessarily apply to another.\r\n\r\nTo those who possess telescopes (not necessarily large ones)\r\nopportunities for the study of comets have much multiplied during the\r\nlast few years, for we are now acquainted with a group of small comets\r\nwhich are constantly coming into view at short intervals of time. The\r\ncomets have now become so numerous that seldom a year passes without one\r\nor more of them coming into view. Whilst that known as Encke’s revolves\r\nround the Sun in 3¼ years, Tuttle’s doing the same in 13½ years, there\r\nare four others whose periods average about 5½ years, 5 which average 6½\r\nyears, together with one of 7½ years and one of 8 years. It is thus\r\nevident that there is a constant succession of these objects available\r\nfor study, and that very few months can ever elapse that some one or\r\nmore of them are not on view. They bear the names of the astronomers who\r\neither discovered them originally, or who, by studying their orbits,\r\ndiscovered their periodicity. The names run as follows, beginning with\r\nthe shortest in period and ending with the longest:—\r\n\r\n  Encke’s.                        Winnecke’s.\r\n  Temple’s Second (1873, II.)     Brorsen’s.\r\n                                  Temple’s First (1867, II.)\r\n  Swift’s (1880, V.)              Wolf’s (1884, III.)\r\n  Barnard’s (1884, II.)           Faye’s.\r\n  D’Arrest’s.                     Denning’s.\r\n  Finlay’s.                       Tuttle’s.\r\n\r\nI cannot stay to dwell upon either the history or description of these\r\ncomets separately, but must content myself by saying generally that\r\nwhilst as a rule they are not visible to the naked eye, yet several of\r\nthem may occasionally become so visible when they return to perihelion\r\nunder circumstances which bring them more near than usual to the earth.\r\n\r\nSeveral other comets are on record which it was supposed at one time\r\nwould certainly have been entitled to a place in the above list, but\r\nthree of them in particular have, under very mysterious circumstances,\r\nentirely disappeared from the Heavens.\r\n\r\nChief amongst the mysterious comets must be ranked that which goes by\r\nthe name of Biela. This comet, first seen in 1772, was afterwards found\r\nto have a period of about 6¾ years, and on numerous occasions it\r\nreappeared at intervals of that length down to 1845, when the mysterious\r\npart of its career seems to have commenced. In December of that year\r\nthis comet threw off a fragment of nearly the same shape as itself, and\r\nthe two portions travelled together side by side for four months, the\r\ndistance between the fragments slowly increasing. At the end of the four\r\nmonths in question the comet passed out of sight owing to the distance\r\nfrom the earth to which it had attained. The comet returned again to\r\nperihelion in 1852, remaining visible for three weeks. The two portions\r\nof the comet noticed in 1846 retained their individuality in 1852, but\r\nthe distance between them had increased to about eight times the\r\ngreatest distance noticed in 1846. As a comet Biela’s Comet has never\r\nbeen seen since 1852, and it must now be regarded as having permanently\r\ndisappeared. But what seems to have happened is this, that Biela’s Comet\r\nhas become broken up into a mass of meteors. On November 27, 1872, and\r\nagain in November 1885, when the earth in travelling along its own orbit\r\nreached a certain point where its orbit intersected the former orbit of\r\nBiela’s Comet the Earth encountered, instead of the comet which ought to\r\nhave been there, a wonderful mass of meteors; and it is now generally\r\naccepted that these meteors, which apparently are keeping more or less\r\ntogether as a fairly compact swarm, are nought else than the\r\ndisintegrated materials of what once was Biela’s Comet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 26.—Biela’s Comet, February 19, 1846.]\r\n\r\nIt is extremely probable that as time goes on we shall be able to say\r\nthat an intimate connection subsists between particular comets which\r\nhave been and particular meteoric swarms. We already possess proof that\r\nother comets which once came within our view were at that time revolving\r\nround the Sun in orbits so comparatively small that they should have\r\nreappeared at intervals of half-a-dozen or so years, yet they have not\r\nreappeared. The question therefore suggests itself, Have they been\r\nsubject to some great internal disaster which has led to their\r\ndisintegration? It may be said without doubt that this is in the highest\r\ndegree probable; but short of this, that is short of total\r\ndisintegration into small fragments, we have several cases on record of\r\nwhat I may, for the moment, call ordinary comets breaking up into two or\r\nthree fragments. For a long while astronomers were naturally loath to\r\nbelieve that this was possible, and therefore they discredited the\r\nstatements to that effect which had been made. Though it would occupy\r\ntoo much space to give the particulars of these comets in full it may\r\nyet be worth while just to mention the names of some of them, presumed\r\nto be of short period, which seemed nevertheless to have eluded our\r\ngrasp. I would here specially mention Liais’s Comet of 1860 and the\r\nsecond comet of 1881 as seemingly having undergone some sort of\r\ndisruption akin to what happened in the case of Biela’s Comet.\r\n\r\nThere is another group of periodical comets to be mentioned. These are\r\nsix in number and seem to have periods of 70 years or a little more. Of\r\nthese three have not yet given us the chance of seeing them again; two\r\nhave paid us a second visit, and therefore their periods are not open to\r\ndoubt; whilst the most famous of this group, “Halley’s,” has been\r\nrecorded to have shown itself to the Earth no less than 25 times,\r\nbeginning with the year 11 B. C. It was Halley’s comet which shone over\r\nEurope in April 1066, and was considered the forerunner of the conquest\r\nof England by William of Normandy. It figures in the famous Bayeux\r\ntapestry as a hairy star of strange shape.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that there exists in some inscrutable manner a connection\r\nbetween each of the three great exterior planets and certain groups of\r\ncomets. In the case of Jupiter the association is so very pronounced as\r\nlong ago to have attracted notice; but the French astronomer,\r\nFlammarion, has brought forward some suggestions that Saturn has one\r\ncomet (and perhaps two) with which it is associated; Uranus, two (and\r\nperhaps three); and Neptune, six; whilst farther off than Neptune the\r\nfact that there are two comets, supposed periodical, without a known\r\nplanet to run with them has inspired Flammarion to look with a friendly\r\neye on the idea (often mooted) that outside of Neptune there exists\r\nanother undiscovered planet revolving round the sun in a period of about\r\n300 years.\r\n\r\nThe Jupiter group of comets deserves a few additional words. There are\r\ncertainly nine, and perhaps twelve comets revolving round the Sun in\r\norbits of such dimensions that they either reach up to or slightly\r\noverreach the orbit of Jupiter. The effect of this condition of things\r\nis that on occasions Jupiter and each of the comets may come into such\r\nproximity that the superior mass of Jupiter may exercise a very\r\nseriously disturbing influence over a flimsy and ethereal body like a\r\ncomet. There is reason to suppose that some of the comets now belonging\r\nto the Jupiter group have not done so for any great length of time, but\r\nhaving been wandering about, either in elliptic orbits of great extent,\r\nor even in parabolic orbits, have accidentally come within reach of\r\nJupiter, and so have been, as it were, captured by him. Hence, the\r\norigin of the term, the “capture theory,” as applied to these family\r\ngroups of comets which I have just stated to exist, each presided over,\r\nas it were, by a great planet. It may be that at some future time this\r\ntheory will help us to a clue to the fact that besides the comets of\r\nLexell of 1770, Blainpain of 1819, and Di Vico of 1844, short period\r\ncomets unaccountably missing, there are several others presumed to have\r\nbeen revolving in short period orbits when discovered, and as to which\r\nit is very strange that they should not have been seen before their only\r\nrecorded visit to us, and equally strange that they should never have\r\nbeen seen since.\r\n\r\nIs there any reason to fear the results of a collision between a comet\r\nand the Earth? None whatever. However vague may be, and in a certain\r\nsense must be, our answer to the question, “What is a comet?” certain is\r\nit that every comet is a very imponderable body—a sort of airy nothing,\r\na mass of gas or vapour.[6] At the same time it always has been and\r\nperhaps still is difficult to persuade the public that whatever might be\r\nthe effect on a comet if it were to strike the Earth, the effect on the\r\nEarth, were it to be struck by a comet, would be _nil_. This is not\r\naltogether a matter of speculation, for according to a calculation by\r\nHind, on June 30, 1861, the Earth passed into and through the tail of\r\nthe great comet of that year at about two-thirds of its distance from\r\nthe nucleus. Assuredly there was no dynamical result; but it seems,\r\nhowever, not unlikely that there was an optical result; at any rate,\r\ntraces of something of this sort were noted. Hind himself, in Middlesex,\r\nobserved a peculiar phosphorescence or illumination of the sky which he\r\nattributed at the time to an auroral glare. Lowe, in Nottinghamshire\r\nconfirmed Hind’s statement of the appearance of the heavens on the same\r\nday. The sky had a yellow auroral glare-like look, and the Sun, though\r\nshining, gave but feeble light. The comet was plainly visible at 7.45 p.\r\nm. (during sunshine), and had a much more hazy appearance than on any\r\nsubsequent evening. Lowe adds that his Vicar had the pulpit candles\r\nlighted in the Parish Church at 7 o’clock (it was a Sunday), though only\r\nfive days had elapsed since Midsummer day, which itself proves that some\r\nsensation of darkness was felt even while the Sun was shining.\r\n\r\nSo far as I remember there has been no such thing as a comet panic\r\nduring the present generation, at any rate in civilised countries, but\r\nit is on record that there was a very considerable panic in 1832 in\r\nconnection with the return of Biela’s Comet in the winter of that year.\r\nOlbers as the result of a careful study in advance of the comet’s\r\nmovements found that the comet’s centre would pass only 20,000 miles\r\nwithin the Earth’s orbit, and that as the nebulosity of the comet had in\r\n1805 been more than 20,000 miles in diameter, it was certain, unless its\r\ndimensions had diminished in the 27 years, that some of the comet’s\r\nmatter would overlap the Earth’s orbit; in other words would envelop the\r\nEarth itself, if the Earth happened to be there. This conclusion when it\r\nbecame public was quite enough to create a panic and make people talk\r\nabout the forthcoming destruction of our globe. It was nothing to the\r\npoint (in the public mind) that astronomers were able to predict that\r\nthe Earth would not reach the place where the comet would cross the\r\nEarth’s orbit until four weeks after the comet had come and gone.\r\nHowever, we now know that nothing happened, and I am justified in adding\r\nthat even if there had been contact, Earth meeting comet face to face,\r\nnothing (serious) would have occurred so far as the Earth was concerned.\r\n\r\nThis seems a convenient place for referring to a matter which when it\r\nwas first broached excited a great deal of interest, but about which one\r\ndoes not hear much now-a-days. The period of the small comet known as\r\nEncke’s (which, revolving as it does round the Sun in a little more than\r\nthree years, has the shortest period of any of the periodical comets)\r\nwas found many years ago to be diminishing at each successive return.\r\nThat is to say, it always attained its nearest distance from the Sun at\r\neach apparition 2½ hours sooner than it ought to have done. In order to\r\naccount for this gradual diminution in the comet’s period Encke\r\nconjectured the existence of a thin ethereal medium sufficiently dense\r\nto affect a light flimsy body like a comet, but incapable of obstructing\r\na planet. It has been remarked by Hind that “this contraction of the\r\norbit must be continually progressing, if we suppose the existence of\r\nsuch a medium; and we are naturally led to inquire, What will be the\r\nfinal consequence of this resistance? Though the catastrophe may be\r\naverted for many ages by the powerful attraction of the larger planets,\r\nespecially Jupiter, will not the comet be at last precipitated on the\r\nSun? The question is full of interest, though altogether open to\r\nconjecture.”\r\n\r\nAstronomers are not altogether agreed as to the propriety of this\r\nexplanation. One argument against it is that with _perhaps_ one\r\nexception none of the other short-period comets (all of them small and\r\npresumably deficient in density) seem affected as Encke’s is. On the\r\nother hand Sir John Herschel favoured the explanation just given, as\r\nalso does Hind who is the highest living authority on comets. A German\r\nmathematician, Von Asten, who devoted immense labour to the study of the\r\norbit of Encke’s Comet, thought there should be no hesitation in\r\naccepting the idea of a resisting medium, subject to the limitation that\r\nit does not extend beyond the orbit of Mercury. Von Asten’s allusion to\r\nMercury touches a subject which belongs more directly to the question of\r\nMercury’s orbit and to that other very interesting question, “Are there\r\nany planets, not at present known, revolving round the Sun within the\r\norbit of Mercury.”\r\n\r\nWhich is the largest and most magnificent comet recorded in history? It\r\nis virtually impossible to answer this question, because of the\r\nextravagant and inflated language made use of by ancient and medieval (I\r\nhad almost added, and modern) writers. There is no doubt that the comet\r\nof 1680, studied by Sir I. Newton, the tail of which was curved, and\r\nfrom 70° to 90° long, must have been one of the finest on record, as it\r\nwas also the one which came nearest to the Sun, for it almost grazed the\r\nSun’s surface.\r\n\r\nThe comet of 1744, visible as it was in broad daylight, was, no doubt,\r\nthe finest comet of the 18th century, though in size it has been\r\nsurpassed; yet its six tails must have made it a most remarkable object.\r\nSo far as the 19th century is concerned, our choice lies between the\r\ncomets of 1811, 1843, 1858, and 1861. The comet of 1811 is spoken of by\r\nHind as “perhaps the most famous of modern times. Independently of its\r\ngreat magnitude, the position of the orbit and epoch of perihelion\r\npassage, were such as to render it a very splendid circumpolar object\r\nfor some months.” The tail as regards its length was not so very\r\nremarkable, for at its best, in October 1811, it was only about 25°\r\nlong, its breadth, however, was very considerable; at one time 6°, the\r\nreal length of the tail, about the middle of October, was more than\r\n100,000,000 of miles, and its breadth about 15,000,000 of miles. The\r\nvisibility of this comet was coincident with those events which proved\r\nto be the turning-point in the career of Napoleon I., and there were not\r\nwanting those who regarded the comet as a presage of his disastrous\r\nfailure in Russia. Owing to the long period (17 months), during which\r\nthis comet was visible, it was possible to determine its orbit with\r\nunusual precision. Argelander found its period to be 3065 years, with no\r\ngreater uncertainty than 43 years. The great dimensions of its orbit\r\nwill be realised when it is stated that this comet recedes from the Sun\r\nto a distance of 14 times that of the planet Neptune.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 27.—The Great Comet of 1811.]\r\n\r\nDonati’s comet of 1858, has already received a good deal of notice at my\r\nhands, but the question remains, what are its claims, to be regarded as\r\nthe comet of the century, compared with that of 1843? It is not a little\r\nstrange that though there must have been many persons who saw both, yet\r\nit was only quite recently that I came across, for the first time, a\r\ndescription of both these comets from the same pen. It ought, however,\r\nto be mentioned by way of explanation, that the inhabitants of Europe\r\nonly saw the comet of 1843, when its brilliancy and the extent of its\r\ntail had materially diminished, about a fortnight after it was at its\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nThe description of these two comets to which I have alluded, will be\r\nfound in General J. A. Ewart’s “_Story of a Soldier’s Life_,” published\r\nin 1881. Writing first of all of the comet of 1843, General Ewart says:—\r\n\r\n“It was during our passage from the Cape of Good Hope to the Equator,\r\nand when not far from St. Helena, that we first came in sight of the\r\ngreat comet of 1843. In the first instance a small portion of the tail\r\nonly was visible, at right angles to the horizon; but night after night\r\nas we sailed along, it gradually became larger and larger, till at last\r\nup came the head, or nucleus, as I ought properly to call it. It was a\r\ngrand and wonderful sight, for the comet now extended the extraordinary\r\ndistance of one-third of the heavens, the nucleus being, perhaps, about\r\nthe size of the planet Venus.”—(Vol. i., p. 75.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 28.—The Great Comet of 1882, on October 19 (Artus).]\r\n\r\nAs regards Donati’s comet of 1858, what the General says is:—\r\n\r\n“A very large comet made its appearance about this time, and continued\r\nfor several weeks to be a magnificent object at night; it was, however,\r\n_nothing to the one I had seen in the year 1843_, when on the other side\r\nof the equator.”—(Vol. ii., p. 205.)\r\n\r\nPassing over the great comet of 1861, on which I have already said a\r\ngood deal, I must quit the subject of famous comets by a few words about\r\nthat of 1882, which, though by no means one of the largest, was, in some\r\nrespects, one of the most remarkable of modern times. It was visible for\r\nthe long period of nine months, and was conspicuously prominent to the\r\nnaked eye during September, but these facts, though note-worthy, would\r\nnot have called for particular remark, had not the comet exhibited some\r\nspecial peculiarities which distinguished it from all others. In the\r\nfirst place, it seems to have undergone certain disruptive changes, in\r\nvirtue of which the nucleus became split up into four independent\r\nnuclei. Then the tail may have been tubular, its extremity being not\r\nonly bifid, but totally unsymmetrical with respect to the main part. The\r\ntubular character of the tail was suggested by Tempel. To other\r\nobservers, this feature gave the idea of the comet, properly so-called,\r\nbeing enclosed in a cylindrical envelope, which completely surrounded\r\nthe comet, and overlapped it for a considerable distance at both ends.\r\nFinally (and in this resembling Biela’s comet) the comet of 1882 seems\r\nto have thrown off a fragment which became an independent body.\r\n\r\nWhat has gone before, will, I think, have served abundantly to establish\r\nthe position with which I started, namely, that comets occupy (and\r\ndeservedly so) the front rank amongst those astronomical objects in\r\nwhich, on occasions, the general public takes an interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have thus completed, so far as the space at my disposal has permitted,\r\na popular descriptive Survey of the Solar System. Those who have perused\r\nthe preceding pages, however slight may have been their previous\r\nacquaintance with the Science of Astronomy taken as a whole, will have\r\nno difficulty in realising that what I have said bears but a small\r\nproportion to what I have left unsaid. They will equally, I hope, be\r\nable to see, without indeed the necessity of a suggestion, that all\r\nthose wondrous orbs which we call the planets could neither have come\r\ninto existence nor have been maintained in their allotted places for so\r\nmany thousands of years, except as the result of Design emanating from\r\nan All-powerful Creator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               FOOTNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[1]The remark in the text applies to all the major planets and to a\r\n    large number of the minor planets, but certain of the minor planets\r\n    travel in orbits which are considerably inclined to the ecliptic,\r\n    and therefore to all the other planets.\r\n\r\n[2]Given in full in my _Handbook of Astronomy_, 4th ed., vol. i., p. 26.\r\n\r\n[3]“_Recollections of Past Life_,” 2nd ed., p. 305.\r\n\r\n[4]For some information respecting these Secchi “Types” of Stars, see my\r\n    “_Story of the Stars_,” 2nd ed., p. 140.\r\n\r\n[5]The circle and the ellipse are what are called “closed” curves.\r\n\r\n[6]It is not a little singular that the Chinese in bygone centuries have\r\n    often alluded to comets under the name of vapours; _e.g._, the comet\r\n    of 1618 is recorded as having been “a white vapour 20 cubits long.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 APPENDIX.—TABLES OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          THE SUN AND PLANETS.\r\n\r\n Name.
