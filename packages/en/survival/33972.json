O. Box 1181\r\nJacksonville, Florida\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nForeword\r\n\r\n_By W. F. Blackman, Ph. D., LL. D._\r\n\r\n     _President of the Florida State Live Stock Association,\r\n     Member of the Florida State Live Stock Sanitary Board._\r\n\r\n\r\nRequests for authentic information as to the advantages and\r\npossibilities of Florida for the growing of live stock, and in\r\nparticular of beef cattle, have been coming of late, and in constantly\r\nincreasing numbers, from all parts of the country.\r\n\r\nThis booklet has been compiled for the purpose of providing this\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen who have contributed to the volume are men of ability,\r\nlong and successful experience in the live stock and kindred industries,\r\nand the most trustworthy character. Several of them have been engaged\r\nfor many years in the growing and marketing of cattle on a very large\r\nscale in Texas, and have recently made a prolonged and close study of\r\nFlorida conditions. The report of their findings is of the utmost\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nProf. C. V. Piper, agrostologist of the Bureau of Plant Industry,\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, Washington, is recognized as the foremost\r\nauthority on Southern grasses and forage crops. We are indebted to him\r\nfor permission to make use of the valuable address on this important\r\nsubject which was made by him at the recent annual meeting of the\r\nFlorida State Live Stock Association.\r\n\r\nA study of these papers will make it evident, I believe, that Florida\r\npossesses a number of advantages for the profitable growing of live\r\nstock greater than those to be found elsewhere; among these are a mild,\r\nequable and healthful climate, comparative freedom from animal diseases,\r\na long grazing season, vast areas of cheap lands, a soil adapted to the\r\ngrowing of numerous improved grasses and forage crops (especially such\r\nlegumes as the velvet bean, the cow pea, the soy bean, the vetches, the\r\nindigenous beggar-weed, the peanut, and certain clovers), a copious and\r\nwell-distributed rainfall, and countless springs, streams and lakes,\r\nproviding almost everywhere an abundant and unfailing supply of pure\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt, I believe, that Florida will take a leading place\r\nin the near future among the important live stock states of the Union.\r\nWhat she needs is additional thousands of intelligent, energetic,\r\nthrifty and experienced farmers, who will take advantage of the\r\nopportunities she offers and develop to the full her immense and latent\r\nresources.\r\n\r\nLake Monroe, February, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOSSIBILITIES OF BEEF PRODUCTION IN FLORIDA.\r\n\r\n     _By Frank S. Hastings, Manager of the S. M. S. Ranch,\r\n     Stamford, Texas, who spent two weeks studying conditions in\r\n     Florida just previous to the Sixth Annual Convention of the\r\n     Florida State Live Stock Association, at which he was one of\r\n     the speakers. These impressions have been prepared by Mr.\r\n     Hastings for the benefit of the cattle men of Florida._\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore coming to the State I asked that I might see as many classes of\r\ncattle as possible and in as many different parts of the State as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nMy first trip was through the Everglades. I then made a trip near\r\nGainesville, and visited the registered Hereford herd owned by Mr. N. A.\r\nCallison; also the grade herd of both Herefords and Shorthorns owned by\r\nMr. A. L. Jackson of Gainesville, and the pure-bred and graded Shorthorn\r\nherd owned by Mr. S. H. Gaitskill of McIntosh. Then followed a four\r\ndays' careful trip over the properties and herd of the Kissimmee Island\r\nCattle Company, where I saw Brahma cattle, Hereford cattle and Shorthorn\r\ncattle in various grades, and their herd of Florida cattle bought last\r\nyear. Then over the Indian Prairie country, the Osceola prairie country,\r\nincluding Halpatioka Flats, the marsh country of Okeechobee, with an\r\nunusually good opportunity for seeing the cattle scattered over the open\r\nrange and to observe conditions on the open range.\r\n\r\nIncident to this great expanse, comprehending over six hundred miles in\r\nactual auto driving, I did not see a single windmill, or other\r\nartificial means of furnishing water, although I am told that on not a\r\nsingle acre of that entire property is there any difficulty in finding\r\nwater at a depth of from ten to fifty feet. I shall come back to this\r\nitem, only pausing here to call your especial attention to the fact that\r\nover this vast area of undeveloped water conditions, water can be\r\nsupplied at a very small cost sufficient to increase the carrying\r\ncapacity of the range at least several hundred per cent, and as against\r\ndeveloping a similar water supply over the average Texas pasture\r\ncountry, it can be done at twenty-five per cent of the cost in Florida\r\nas against the Texas cost.\r\n\r\nProbably the most important thing that I saw in Florida was the\r\nregistered Hereford herd of Mr. Callison. I recall that he boasted that\r\nin eight years they had never been given any winter help, and there were\r\nno evidences on his property that the cattle were in any way pampered.\r\n\r\nHe had about thirty or forty of last spring's calves, which he was just\r\nweaning, and they were as good, on the average, as any bunch of calves I\r\nhave ever seen in the great registered Hereford producing districts. I\r\nsaw his yearlings and twos and his cows, and the entire herd shows in\r\ngeneral development and quality a very favorable comparison with\r\nanything in the great breeding districts outside of distinct show herds.\r\n\r\nIf the climate of Florida can produce these registered cattle without\r\nhelp and have them make a favorable comparison with cattle in the great\r\nregistered breeding grounds of other parts of America, there is no\r\nreason why beef cattle can not be produced which, in turn, will form a\r\nfavorable comparison with those of the great pasture breeding grounds,\r\nwhich, in turn, are furnishing the feeder cattle for the corn belt.\r\n\r\nOn Mr. Jackson's place we found both graded Herefords and Shorthorns in\r\nthe third generation, with splendid development and quality, and we\r\nfound in his registered or pure-bred herd of Shorthorns good quality and\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nAt the home of Mr. Gaitskill we found both pure breds and grades of good\r\ndevelopment, and a splendid object lesson in a half-bred cow known as\r\n\"Old Blue,\" her dam one of the primitive Florida cows and her sire a\r\npure-bred Shorthorn bull. She is what might be called a blue roan, with\r\nthe blue almost black. Then we saw her daughters and their daughters,\r\nand I think we saw a fourth generation, but either in this third or\r\nfourth generation, I remarked to Mr. Gaitskill that he could lie a\r\nlittle about that heifer, as she had absolutely every appearance and all\r\ndevelopment of an absolutely pure-bred Shorthorn.\r\n\r\nIn this same district we learned from Mr. Jackson that graded cattle all\r\nthe way from half-breeds up to seven-eighths and in the mixed threes and\r\nfours ages, all by registered bulls, weighed 900 pounds off grass last\r\nfall. As near as I can obtain information, the same ages in the native\r\nFlorida steers and under most favorable conditions would probably not\r\nweigh to exceed 600 pounds.\r\n\r\nOn this same trip Mr. Edwards of McIntosh told me that he got about half\r\nthe gain on the native steers that he does from three-quarter-bred\r\ngrades, on the same feed.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing is a practical demonstration that as far as climate,\r\ngeneral feeds and ordinary normal conditions are concerned, graded\r\ncattle thrive in Florida.\r\n\r\nIt is important that I should have seen them, because I am working on\r\nwell defined and demonstrated general principles of breeding and beef\r\nproduction, and they respond in every way to the foregoing.\r\n\r\nFrom this time on we must reckon with the world's supply of live stock.\r\nWithout attempting to go into details, there has been a very material\r\ndecrease in it during the past ten years. We know that Europe must be\r\nre-stocked after the war, and that the American supply is freer from\r\ndisease than that of any other country.\r\n\r\nWe know that under normal conditions the beef production of America has\r\nnot kept pace with the population, and that even without the influence\r\nof war values of beef, stock cattle values have shown a steady increase\r\nfor the past ten years. There is, therefore, every reason to believe\r\nthat for a very long period in the future, even taking into\r\nconsideration reduced beef consumption as the result of substitutes or\r\nevery other influence, there is a reasonable expectation for strong\r\nvalues and a profit on production under normal expense. I think that we\r\nmay go beyond the favorable general market and say that there will be a\r\nbetter market in proportion for the intermediate grades of beef, for\r\ngrass produced beef, than for the very extreme corn-fed finish, and that\r\nin the evolution of the Florida beef problem, the grades produced will\r\nat least be in as great demand, and probably greater demand, than the\r\nultra finished class.\r\n\r\nIt is, therefore, fair to argue that the market is with the producer.\r\n\r\nYou are singularly fortunate in having a Legislature which seems in\r\nevery way disposed toward doing everything in its power to help develop\r\nthe resources of the State.\r\n\r\nThe Government believes that live stock production is its second\r\ngreatest problem, and in every possible way that it can give\r\nco-operation is pledged to do so. In fact, I do not think that I would\r\nhave been here at all unless a high official in the Bureau of Animal\r\nIndustry had not urged me to come, in line with their work of general\r\ndevelopment throughout the South.\r\n\r\nAnother thing, I find that Florida is very much in the public eye, and\r\nthat all the live stock journals are anxious to have anything which\r\ntouches upon increased beef production anywhere, but in the South\r\nparticularly.\r\n\r\nWith the knowledge that I might be here some time this winter, I talked\r\nto two of the great packers about the development of the beef industry\r\nin the South, and they both said that they thought the South was going\r\nto come to the front very rapidly, and that either they or some one else\r\nwould undoubtedly keep pace with the development by enlarging their\r\npresent facilities or building new packing houses.\r\n\r\nIn that connection a packer loves a hog country to work in conjunction\r\nwith cattle. Without giving the topic any more than this general\r\nstatement, I can see where hog production is going to be one of the\r\ngreat things in Florida, and that while in Texas we do not attempt to\r\nproduce any hogs along with our cattle, that hogs will be to some extent\r\na part of the great pasture problems.\r\n\r\nIn a general way, conditions are very similar in Florida now to those of\r\nsome thirty-five years ago in Texas, at which time that State was an\r\nopen range proposition. Today, with the exception of a very small strip\r\nalong the Gulf Coast, the entire State of Texas is under fence, and in a\r\ngeneral way has been under fence for nearly twenty years.\r\n\r\nThere has never been a time in the State of Texas in the past twenty\r\nyears when practically all of the grazing area of the State has not been\r\noccupied, and as against the cattle carried on the open range with\r\npractically no water development, the pastures of Texas, which are known\r\nas the range (but the word range in Texas means large bodies of inclosed\r\nland), are carrying several hundred per cent more cattle than at that\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nThe thing which in Texas led to great hardships alike to the large\r\npasture owner and to the settler himself was the fact that so much of\r\nthe land did not lie in solid bodies. I judge that in the main there is\r\nmuch less of this in Florida than in Texas, and that either by\r\npartition, or purchase, or auxiliary lease, the great bulk of that\r\ncomplication can be handled.\r\n\r\nAnd that brings me to the principle of fencing, which I think may be\r\ncovered under the general heading of Control. First, it means defined\r\nownership, which is always recognized. It means fire control, because it\r\neliminates the wantonness which we now find all over your open range,\r\neach man working out his problem and firing the range for various\r\ncauses.\r\n\r\nFencing means that an area may be developed to its capacity. For\r\ninstance, on your ranges fire kills the various varieties of the carpet\r\nor blanket grass and kills the little blue cane, as well as any number\r\nof other grasses, all of which, however, come back where an area is\r\nprotected, and as they are among your very best feeds, the carrying\r\ncapacity of a pasture is materially increased.\r\n\r\nWater may be developed through the windmill process directly in\r\nproportion with the needs of the cattle and concentrated to them as\r\nagainst any water development on the open range.\r\n\r\nIt is a scientific fact that eradication of the tick may be accomplished\r\nby resting a pasture for a certain time. Fencing means the concentration\r\nof that area to the best bulls as against not only their mixture with\r\nthe scrub bulls on the open range, but the fact that the old Spanish\r\nfighting blood in the scrub bull materially reduces the effectiveness of\r\nthe higher class bull. Fencing means that if on any favorable areas you\r\nwish to introduce any of the wonderful grasses which the Department of\r\nAgriculture is showing can be spread very rapidly, it can be done\r\nconcentrating to ownership.\r\n\r\nFencing means that lands which are now being occupied by some one else\r\nwithout revenue, but at an expense, may be made to either pay a fair\r\ninterest on the investment of land, improvements and cattle, or at least\r\na rental revenue which will take care of taxes, interest on improvements\r\nand become a net economy, as against the open range.\r\n\r\nI believe, too, that the principle will stand that a property defined by\r\nfences immediately takes on increased value; that the buyer would pay\r\nmore for it per acre defined than looking at it in the abstract as part\r\nof the open range.\r\n\r\nI do not think that in the whole State of Texas you will find a single\r\nland owner, who has fenced his ranches, who does not know that it has\r\nbeen done at a splendid profit.\r\n\r\nYou begin your problem with a tick-wide eradication law, which Texas has\r\nonly had a very short time. You begin it at a time when the Government\r\nand most of the tick-infested states are releasing thousands of square\r\nmiles every year, and at a time when both science and every practical\r\nobserver understands it as an economic measure, which may be pursued\r\nwith practically no detriment or danger to the cattle. I think that we\r\nprobably dipped in the neighborhood of a million cattle, considering the\r\nnumber of times that they were dipped, and we did not lose a total of\r\nfifty head from all causes.\r\n\r\nEradication means larger cattle in better condition on the same feeds\r\nand a less mortality. It means that they can go anywhere in America\r\nwithout restriction; or, in other words, a broader market and no\r\npunishment just before shipment. I do not think that the perpetuity of\r\nthe tick can be defended from any economic standpoint.\r\n\r\nI want to take up the breeding section, first with reference to what\r\nyour cattle represent and a comparison with primitive cattle in other\r\ncountries. I am advised on reliable authority that forty years ago the\r\nonly ready money in this country came from the cattle men who either\r\ntopped their bulls and took them to Cuba, or the Cubans came here and\r\ntopped them, taking the very best sires that you produced for sport and\r\nslaughter. You have, therefore, for forty years been grading down, as\r\nfar as the sire is concerned.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of the cows, there has been no culling, added to which\r\nthere has been in-breeding, and on both the sire and dam side following\r\nout the law that evil qualities intensify in posterity, the tendency has\r\nbeen down instead of up in the breeding of native cattle for forty\r\nyears, to which the only relief has been a very limited introduction of\r\nthe beef strains.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this, the cattle have been infested with ticks, and every\r\nevil influence that could arrest their development seems to have had a\r\ngood chance at them, and yet in spite of all this I find them on the\r\nwhole much better than I had expected.\r\n\r\nI have been trying to make a comparison between them and the primitive\r\ncattle of Texas, which I have known for fifty years, as they were\r\npastured next to my father's farm in great quantities when I was only\r\nseven years old and long before there was any process of improvement. I\r\nthink the Texas cattle had greater scale, but from all I can learn I do\r\nnot believe they had any greater vitality. I think, on the whole,\r\nthough, that in evolving a race of cattle you have a little further to\r\ngo than Texas had.\r\n\r\nMr. Alvin Sanders, Editor of the Breeders' Gazette, in his book, \"The\r\nStory of the Herefords,\" traces very carefully the first introduction\r\nof blooded bulls to the Texas and Western ranges, and forty years,\r\ncertainly forty-five, is as far back as that influence began. My own\r\npeople began on primitive Texas cattle in 1882, but from that time used\r\nonly full-blooded sires, about ninety per cent Hereford and about ten\r\nper cent Shorthorn, and only about three years after I went with them\r\nsixteen years ago, I took selected calves from their herd to Chicago and\r\nwon grand sweepstakes for feeder cattle with them against all\r\ncompetition from all sections of the United States. When I went to the\r\nS. M. S. herd I found a wonderful lot of breeding cows, the bulk of them\r\nat least fifteen-sixteenths and only requiring a vigorous culling\r\nprocess to bring them to a remarkably high standard.\r\n\r\nI was identified with Mr. Kirk Armour during the great progress in\r\ngrading up Texas herds in the '90's, and it was noticeable in the stock\r\nyards that in a short space of about six years there was an absolute\r\nchange in the general run of cattle from the ranges to the yards from\r\nprimitive cattle to cattle showing very appreciable improvement, and in\r\ntwelve years the longhorn had become a scarcity; he was practically\r\nextinct in 1900.\r\n\r\nArgentina during the same period evolved from a primitive race of cattle\r\none which will compare very favorably to that of America in its\r\nup-grading. The other South American Republics have been slower, but\r\nbetween Argentina and America two demonstrations have been given within\r\nmy own lifetime of a race of cattle absolutely redeemed from the\r\nprimitive to practically full-bloods, and that the first twelve years of\r\nthat work has resulted in animals showing fifty per cent increase in\r\nweight under the same conditions, a much higher degree of meat in the\r\nrib and loin and round, with an immense improvement in their instinct\r\nfor putting on weight on the same feed over the primitive cattle.\r\n\r\nI am simply taking these generally demonstrated laws of breeding to\r\napply to your conditions. I am sure that by using good sires you will\r\nfind an immense improvement in three years; that in six years it will be\r\na revelation, and that in twelve years you will have a race of cattle\r\nfor which the world will make a path to your door.\r\n\r\nTo arrive at this process I must first disclaim any thought of urging\r\nany particular breed upon you. On the other hand, I could not be fair to\r\nthe problem without calling your attention to the fact that the Hereford\r\nhas been the redeemer of the great Western ranges. I am sure, however,\r\nthat the greater the degree of purity that you use in him, up to at\r\nleast a seven-eighths, will be shown in the result.\r\n\r\nI find that there is some prejudice against the Hereford in Florida, but\r\nas far as I can follow it they apparently got a very low grade of\r\nbulls--I am inclined to think not over half-breeds, and then, too, they\r\nfound they didn't get any more at that time for the better grades than\r\nthey did for the others.\r\n\r\nThe limitation of the Hereford is that in the first cross between a\r\npure-bred and any of the primitive cattle ninety per cent will show\r\nwhite faces or dominant characteristics, and just so in the use of\r\nbulls, the animal may not have the intensification of blood that he\r\nshould have simply because he has a white face, and the bull peddler\r\nhas, as a proposition, bought something that he could sell at a profit,\r\nrather than in following out any visions of cattle improvement.\r\n\r\nI can not urge you too strongly to know absolutely the breeding strength\r\nof anything you buy, and that means in a general way that you must buy\r\nknown cattle. I realize, too, that there is a great shortage of bulls,\r\nand probably the only way that you can get what you want, because it\r\ngoes without saying that you can not afford to pay the price for\r\nregistered bulls in all your work, is to work in some way through a\r\ncentral community of interests, go to Texas and buy the bull calf crop\r\nof some herd of cattle that will show fifteen-sixteenths or better\r\nbreeding. I urge this freely, because you must go below the line and\r\nnone of our own cattle are available. I believe that if you bring these\r\ncalves over here, say in November at weaning time, at the age of about\r\nsix months, and give them some good winter help, that they will\r\nacclimate quickly, and will give you very fair returns in the yearling\r\nperiod, although, of course, you can not expect from them a real\r\nusefulness until the two-year-old period.\r\n\r\nWhile the Hereford has been the redeemer of the ranges, practically\r\nevery ranch man in Texas has felt that an undercurrent of Shorthorn is\r\nof the greatest advantage. We have used it persistently in our own work,\r\nand feel that it has given a most appreciable contribution to the weight\r\nand general quality of our cattle.\r\n\r\nIn the last few years the Brahma cattle have come into prominence, and\r\nevery investigation that I have made shows that they will undoubtedly\r\nprove a great factor in the evolution of Florida cattle. They seem to be\r\nimmune to most of the pests and do not require as much in the way of\r\nacclimatization. They show a wonderful growth in yearlings and they mark\r\ntheir progeny with size and distinct characteristics in a most decided\r\nway. The packers seem to like them; they kill out a large per cent of\r\nbeef, and while I have never had any experience with them, all my\r\nobservation has been in their favor, and I urge you to go as far as you\r\ncan in utilizing them in Florida.\r\n\r\nI am, however, convinced that you are going to need both the Shorthorn\r\nand the Hereford to combine with them. I am also convinced that both the\r\nShorthorns and the Black cattle are going to prove very valuable\r\nadjuncts in your eventual work in the State, particularly as applied to\r\nsmall areas where the cattle are not asked to live as much upon their\r\nown resources. The experience, however, in Texas has been that the calf\r\ncrop is not as great from either of these breeds as from the Herefords.\r\n\r\nFor your information, on the S. M. S. Ranch we have averaged better than\r\neighty percent calf crop for the last ten years. I think that perhaps\r\nyou will find the Brahma cattle even more prolific than the Herefords. I\r\nthink, too, that in every possible way you should encourage the breeders\r\nof full-blood cattle in all of these breeds, and that you give them\r\nevery encouragement in purchasing their progeny.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of good bulls is a comparatively simple matter, because\r\nthey can be purchased, but a great cow herd can only be produced by\r\naccumulation, probably by a culling of at least ten per cent of all\r\nfemales every year during the process of up-grading. The yearling\r\nheifers should not be bred. We always cull them when about eighteen\r\nmonths old, cutting them ten per cent. Culling should be done both from\r\nan individual standpoint and from the standpoint of \"Get.\" The culling\r\nprocess is the most important element in beef evolution.\r\n\r\nThe process of culling will not be extravagant, because looking to the\r\nnext few years it would seem that canner cattle will probably be as\r\nstrong as any other branch of the industry, and these culls are usually\r\nnot only splendid canners, but furnish quite an element of cutters,\r\nwhich means cattle producing very fair meat for regular consumption. I\r\nbelieve, too, that on any range of appreciable dimensions you will find\r\nit an economy to produce your own bulls, and in starting any good sized\r\nproperty I urge that you keep that in mind. Get your cows just as good\r\nas you can get them; of course pure-breds will be better, and then use\r\nonly the best registered sires in that herd.\r\n\r\nI think advisable, too, in your branding, to put the year brand on all\r\nheifers, as it will be of material assistance to you in the matter of\r\nknowing the intensification of blood during the early process. It will\r\nnot be so important later on when the cattle are all very high grade.\r\n\r\nThe use of the scrub bull is an economic crime; therefore no matter what\r\nyou use in the way of a sire you are pointed upward, but I feel that it\r\nwill be a distinct economy to try to get seven-eighths, or at least\r\nfifteen-sixteenths sires.\r\n\r\nAnother thing which offers a great economy in your country is the\r\npossibility of dropping calves an average of about two months earlier\r\nthan they do in Texas. We do not like to have a calf come before the 1st\r\nof April. I believe that you can drop yours during January and February\r\nwithout any trouble, judging from the average condition of your cattle\r\nin a winter said to be from early October, the most severe you have ever\r\nhad. Dropping a calf at that time will have him old enough to eat your\r\nyoung grasses when they begin to come. He will have a two months' pull\r\nover the Texas calf; will have at least two months longer to combine\r\nnursing and grazing to deliver him the first of November.\r\n\r\nAs a summary of your breeding problem, I regard it as the simplest thing\r\nyou have to deal with. There seems to be a sure result by comparison\r\nwith other countries; there can be little argument as to its economic\r\nvalue, and it is simply a matter of disposition and making the proper\r\ninvestment in inclosures, in bulls and water development to accomplish a\r\ngood business result.\r\n\r\nI only want to add this fragment as to breeding. Since dictating this\r\nsection I chanced to meet at lunch today Mr. Will Goodwin, for thirty\r\nyears one of the officers and managers of the Breeders' Gazette and one\r\nof the best authorities in the world on cattle. His winter home is near\r\nOcala, Florida, and he has seen enough of your ranges to convince him of\r\ntheir great utility in beef production. He agrees with me that the\r\nevolution of your cattle is simply a matter of disposition. I find,\r\nhowever, that he has no use for the Brahma bull, although he joins me in\r\nthe belief that you can not do anything to hurt the present breeding\r\nprocess, and he rather grudgingly admits that the Brahma bull may have a\r\nplace in scale. I reviewed with him at some length what has preceded and\r\nasked him what he thought about my comparison with the Texas primitive\r\ncattle as to having more scale. He thinks I am right in that connection,\r\nbut says that he believes the Florida cow is more shapely; that she has\r\na better hindquarter than the old Texan cattle, and is, in a sense, a\r\nminiature Shorthorn, and that he believes that a cross between a\r\nShorthorn and a primitive Florida cow will give you the best basis.\r\n\r\nI called his attention to the fact that in range experience neither the\r\nBlacks nor the Shorthorns seem to be able to make their own living as\r\nwell as the Herefords and do not get the calf crop, and he was quite\r\nfree to say that it had a little force. On the other hand, he confirms\r\nfully my belief that where a better class of protection can be offered\r\nthan the vast ranges, the Shorthorn cross and the cross with the Blacks\r\neither on primitive cows or their cross will have splendid results.\r\n\r\nHe also called my attention to the prominence that Blacks are getting in\r\nFlorida.\r\n\r\nThere is, therefore, a very wide range of possibilities in your breeding\r\nproblem, all of it pointed upward, and there may be something in your\r\nexperience here which will show that the Shorthorn and Black have a\r\ngreater mission on the open range than they had in Texas. There\r\ncertainly can be no question about the value of the blood.\r\n\r\nAnd here I might add that the Government is not asking any one to\r\nincrease beef production from a patriotic standpoint, but rather that it\r\noffers a splendid investment. And perhaps I might add that when our boys\r\nwho have gone into the army come back again they will practically all\r\nbe trained athletes; men seasoned to the out-of-doors and loving it; men\r\nwho have obtained an earnestness in life and a new vision as to\r\nusefulness, and when you stop to reflect that we have been sending the\r\nflower of the world to the front, when it comes back to us we will not\r\nonly have the attributes I have described, but the flower of the world\r\nto apply them, and I look for an increased interest in all of the\r\nout-of-door lines of business such as America has never seen before.\r\n\r\nI thought I knew something of my own country and something of the\r\npossibilities of land available for cattle production, but seeing your\r\nranges has been a revelation. They are off the track of the tourist.\r\nThere is sparse settlement, and they are known to very few. In fact,\r\nthey might be, in a sense, called a hidden country, but the whole of\r\nAmerica is interested in everything that offers a good agricultural or\r\nstock-raising possibility, and when our boys come back, not only the\r\nboys of the South, but the boys of America are going to investigate your\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nI promised to come back to water development. Practically every question\r\nthat I have asked in the main about water has been covered by the reply,\r\n\"Water everywhere.\" Much of your area is watered by rivers and lakes,\r\nand where good surface water is not easily available for stock, your\r\nwell water is so easily obtainable and at such small investment you can\r\nafford to have it every two miles over the entire country.\r\n\r\nI am told that the windmill will furnish ample production, and at that\r\nnarrow depth the light mills, which go well in a light wind, are\r\navailable. We have found it very valuable, however, to use the one and a\r\nhalf horsepower gasoline engines, and from that pumping supply as our\r\nlive stock demanded, because you must keep water constantly before the\r\ncattle. Cattle become accustomed to watering at one place, and if there\r\nis no water they will stand around and wait for the mill to pump.\r\n\r\nWithout attempting to go into details, you should have a proper water\r\nstorage at each mill. It is small expense, and with a storage tank and a\r\nwindmill it would be cheaper than a gasoline engine.\r\n\r\nIt is always customary in our country to put salt around the water\r\nholes. I find, as a proposition, your cattle do not have salt at all,\r\nand it is very much needed in their development. Over some areas there\r\nis no lime, and there it would probably be wise to combine salt and\r\nlime, which can be very easily done by using a compressed cake, not rock\r\nsalt. It may take these primitive cattle some time to learn how to lick\r\nthe salt, but the next generation will be there all right, and it will\r\nhave its influence in their development.\r\n\r\nIt is my observation that under a proper development of water, a fenced\r\narea and proper subdivision fences permitting the protection of one\r\npasture for winter purposes, forcing the cattle out in summer upon areas\r\nbest adapted to that season, that Florida lands will carry from two to\r\nthree times the number of cattle that the average Texas range does.\r\n\r\nI find, too, that a great deal of the range offers a splendid hog feed\r\nfrom the cabbage palm, the seed of the palmetto and from the mast found\r\nin the shinnery. It would seem, therefore, that an appreciable number of\r\nhogs may be produced without extra cost on most Florida ranges. While\r\nthey will not sell for the top prices unless fattened on some\r\nconcentrate, they bring a very fair figure as against combined result\r\nand overhead charges, and should be a big factor in revenue and one that\r\nwe do not have in Texas.\r\n\r\nYour lands are singularly free from pests. To illustrate, it cost us\r\nsomething over $75,000 to kill prairie dogs on about 450,000 acres of\r\nTexas lands, and outside of the shinnery lands the great bulk of Texas\r\nlands have been populated with prairie dogs, which in bad times take at\r\nleast one-third of the grass. You do not seem to have the screw worm,\r\nwhich bothers us a great deal in very wet weather.\r\n\r\nYou can own your posts at a comparatively small cost and with normal\r\nprices of wire I should say could construct your fences for\r\nthree-fourths of what it costs us. You have no very long drives for your\r\ncattle when shipping them, and in the matter of winter help to your\r\ncattle it will cost very little as compared with what we have to spend\r\nin Texas. To give you an idea, we are buying $50,000 worth of feed to\r\nwinter a herd of 25,000 head of cattle. While your season here will\r\npermit you to get through with very little extra cost, if any, I think\r\nthat you should make a provision for some concentrate, so as to have it.\r\nIn Texas, when the grass is all gone, the use of cotton seed cake is\r\nlimited when not taken in conjunction with a good filler, and there is\r\nnever a time when you at least don't have a good filler. It is simply a\r\nmatter of getting a little concentrate on it and cutting out the weak\r\ncattle and concentrating them to such winter help.\r\n\r\nYou are right where we were in '82--large areas of land, in which our\r\nproblem was to make them carry themselves without cost, or pay a small\r\ninterest until such time as they would sell at good value. We had very\r\nlow values on cattle, long distances from the railroads--in fact, every\r\npossible disadvantage, but these lands have always paid for taxes and\r\noverhead expenses and have always given us a little something in\r\naddition, and are at a point now where they pay us a very good net\r\ninterest on $10.00 land and $70.00 cows. We probably could sell every\r\nacre that we own at a price which would give us more net money than we\r\nget from the cattle business, but our people consider it a mighty good\r\nback-log to have lands which were almost without value brought up to\r\nthat value and to their earning capacity.\r\n\r\nI think that if you go into the cattle business you should study very\r\ncarefully the possibility of disposing of the calf at weaning time. That\r\nis something you will have to grow to. The Government is authority for\r\nthe statement that the economical production of beef is the calf, taken\r\nat weaning time, not allowed to go back, but kept coming in the matter\r\nof feeding, and if this calf is to be taken at that age, you can run\r\ntwenty per cent more cows on your range, producing an average of fifteen\r\nper cent more calves, as against developing a steer to the three or four\r\nyear old period, in which his individual gain is your revenue in the\r\nmatter of a carrying charge. I believe, too, you will find it an economy\r\nto dehorn these calves at branding time. It can be done with practically\r\nno loss of blood. The animal is well in a very short time. I think he\r\ndevelops better and he certainly sells quicker.\r\n\r\nPackers have immense contracts, and if the war continues they must have\r\nlots of tinned beef. On the other hand, if the war stops the world must\r\nstock up again with tinned beef. We know that they expected to pay an\r\naverage of at least one cent per pound more for their canners the past\r\nyear, but that the great drought has forced so many cattle in, the\r\nowners were very thankful to take what they got and the packers were\r\nforced to their capacity to attempt to handle them in such quantities.\r\nWe know that the calf crop of Texas next year will probably show a\r\ndecrease of twenty-five per cent, and that if rain comes in time to give\r\ngood spring grass that a farmer will pay anywhere from ten to\r\ntwenty-five per cent more in Texas than any other part of America. It\r\nwould not surprise me at all to see your Florida cattle shippped over to\r\nTexas. We know, too, that next year, instead of the normal number of\r\ncows coming in in the culling process, which find their average market\r\nas canners, it will be the disposition of every ranchman to hold back\r\ncows which would ordinarily go into the culls in order that his ranch\r\nmay be brought up sooner to re-stocking.\r\n\r\nI would urge all of you to get your fences up and buy as many cattle as\r\nyou can handle, because the she-stuff is going to be higher. This is\r\nparticularly true of the she-stuff which has been selling at the values\r\nof Florida primitive cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORAGE CROPS FOR FLORIDA.\r\n\r\n     (_Address delivered before the Florida State Live Stock\r\n     Association, January 9, 1918, by Prof. C. V. Piper,\r\n     Agrostologist, Bureau of Plant Industry, United States\r\n     Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C._)\r\n\r\n\r\nFor many years I have been interested in the problem of more and better\r\nforage for the South, because it has long been evident to students of\r\nagriculture that sooner or later there would be an important live stock\r\nindustry developed in the South. The present greatly increased interest\r\nof Florida, and, indeed, of the entire South, marks, I believe, the\r\nbeginning of this epoch. Several economic incentives have conspired to\r\nbring about the present active interest and development. Chief among\r\nthem, perhaps, were: First, changes necessitated by the spread of the\r\ncotton boll weevil; and, second, the present high range of prices for\r\nlive stock--prices that in all probability will be little, if any,\r\nreduced for many years to come.\r\n\r\nAnother incentive that must, however, be recognized was the desire of\r\nenterprising men to develop the latent resources of the South, not only\r\nas an attest of their economic faith, but also from the patriotic motive\r\nof helping the nation in this period of stress.\r\n\r\nAs an indication of the extent of this movement I may state that within\r\nthe past two years over thirty extensive live stock enterprises have\r\nbeen launched, all in the piney woods region of the Southern States.\r\nMost of these companies have ample capital, and most of them are\r\nproceeding along conservative lines.\r\n\r\nThe future development and prosperity of this industry must rest upon a\r\nthorough knowledge and proper utilization of the forage crops adapted to\r\nthe region. In very large measure these forages are quite different from\r\nthose used in the portions of the United States where animal husbandry\r\nis most developed. From a practical standpoint we cannot use in the\r\nSouth the forages of the North and West, with the important exception of\r\ncorn. The other great forages--timothy, red clover, alfalfa, blue grass\r\nand white clover--can never become important in Florida. This fact needs\r\nemphasis, because the newcomer in Florida is often carried away with the\r\nidea that these forages may be made to succeed.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of this active live stock development it is unfortunate\r\nthat there is not a larger body of exact data concerning both the\r\nculture and feeding value of the more important forages available. There\r\nis a large amount of such information concerning corn, timothy, red\r\nclover, alfalfa, blue grass and white clover, not only in America, but\r\nalso in Europe. Furthermore, countless live stock farms exist where the\r\npractical utilization of these forages has been worked out in detail. In\r\ncomparison, our stock of knowledge concerning Southern forages, both\r\nfrom experimental investigations and from practical experience, is\r\nrelatively small. This is not surprising, because the experiment\r\nstations have very properly been compelled to devote their energies\r\nmainly to assisting agricultural industries in proportion to their\r\nexisting importance, rather than to industries in which there was\r\nrelatively little interest. In this matter of Southern forages I have\r\nlong advocated much more generous support on the part of the State and\r\nFederal agricultural agencies, because I have great faith in the future\r\npossibilities.\r\n\r\nWith the magnificent start that has now been made in live stock farming\r\nin the South, we may hope for much more generous support to live stock\r\nand forage investigations, but this hope will be realized only if we are\r\ninsistent in our demands. The knowledge thus to be obtained is\r\nfundamental, and the progress that is made in live stock raising will be\r\nconditioned in an important measure on the accurate investigations that\r\ncan be conducted only at properly equipped experiment stations.\r\n\r\nOne other angle of these general considerations must not be overlooked.\r\nThe northern or western man who may be considering developing a live\r\nstock ranch in the South naturally wants to see developed ranches in\r\nwhich the practical problems have been worked out. In all the South\r\nthere are very few cattle ranches which have reached a finished state of\r\ndevelopment--where the concrete demonstration exists of a type of\r\nmanagement that can be duplicated.\r\n\r\nNow, of course, I am fully aware that Florida and all the South has long\r\nhad an extensive cattle industry based on the natural grasses of the\r\nprairies and of the piney woods. In general, this has been a profitable\r\nindustry, especially on free range. Without hurting anyone's feelings,\r\nwe will, I think, agree that this has not been a very high grade of live\r\nstock ranching. Indeed, the ordinary Northern or Western man, who is, of\r\ncourse, a superficial observer, has gotten the idea from the scrub\r\ncattle and razorback hogs that he saw, that there is something in the\r\nSouth that is inimical to good live stock. Usually he has decided it is\r\nthe climate. Fortunately we know from the work of every Southern\r\nexperiment station, as well as of a few good live stock ranches, that\r\nthe South can raise just as good cattle and hogs as the North. It isn't\r\na matter of climate, at all, but purely one of _breed_ and _feed_.\r\n\r\nI have spoken thus candidly because I feel that I am a friend among\r\nfriends, and because I have very much faith in the industry you\r\nrepresent. If I were not so optimistic as to the future of the live\r\nstock industry in Florida I should be afraid to lay bare any weak\r\nfactors that exist. I believe with Huxley in the wisdom of facing\r\nthings as they are, rather than indulging in make believe.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it will be most helpful in discussing the forages adapted to\r\nFlorida to proceed from the viewpoint of the man starting a cattle\r\nranch. The basis, of course, of any profitable cattle ranch is permanent\r\npasturage, the cheapest of all feeds, and, to supplement this, a supply\r\nof feed, which may be hay, ensilage, or in Southern Florida, green feed,\r\nto bridge over the season of short pastures. If one is to produce highly\r\nfinished beef, grain feeds and other concentrates must be raised or\r\npurchased.\r\n\r\nIn discussing pasturage it will be convenient to recognize three types\r\nof lands, namely, piney woods, prairie, and mucks, realizing, of course,\r\nthat this is a very rough classification.\r\n\r\n\r\nPiney Woods Lands.\r\n\r\nIn the piney woods the natural pasturage is composed mainly of broom\r\nsedge and wire grasses. During the growing season, from spring till late\r\nfall, these grasses furnish fair pasturage, but through the rest of the\r\nyear they merely enable animals to exist. What can be done towards\r\nconverting these poor native pastures into good permanent pastures?\r\nThere are three possibilities in the light of our present knowledge. On\r\nbetter soils good Bermuda pastures can be developed, or where the lands\r\nare moist, as on most flatwood areas, carpet grass may be used. On the\r\ndrier and poorer soils, Natal grass is the only one that has given much\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nHow can Bermuda or carpet grass pasture best be established? The sure\r\nmethod is to stump your land and plow it, and then plant the Bermuda by\r\nthe vegetative method in spring, or any time thereafter in summer,\r\nduring the rainy season. At the McNeill station in Mississippi, located\r\non land much like that of the northern tier of counties in Florida, they\r\nhave developed the following method: Plow furrows about ten feet apart\r\nbetween the stumps in spring, and stick in a root or sprig of Bermuda\r\nabout every ten feet. At McNeill it is found necessary to use a little\r\nfertilizer to insure the growth of these Bermuda plants. During the\r\nfollowing winter the stumps are removed, and then in spring the land is\r\nplowed and Lespedeza seed sown. Enough Bermuda has grown in the furrows\r\nto insure a stand of Bermuda, and this is supplemented by the Lespedeza.\r\nIndeed, the first season the Lespedeza will furnish more pasturage than\r\nthe Bermuda. Lespedeza is rather a tricky plant in Florida and is hardly\r\nworth consideration except in the northern part of the State.\r\n\r\nOn most of the Florida flatwood soils carpet grass is much more\r\naggressive than Bermuda, and in time will, if left alone, completely\r\nreplace the Bermuda. To a large extent this can be obviated by plowing\r\nthe pastures whenever the carpet grass seems to be obtaining the upper\r\nhand. Unfortunately, we do not know the relative values of equal areas\r\nof Bermuda grass and of carpet grass where the latter is most\r\naggressive. Carpet grass does not grow so tall, but is green for a\r\nlonger period. It may, indeed, be found more economical not to try to\r\nsave the Bermuda after the carpet grass crowds it. From observations, I\r\nam inclined to believe that neither the carrying capacity nor the feed\r\nvalues per acre of the two grasses is greatly different on most flatwood\r\nsoils. If this be true, it would not be economy to go to any particular\r\ntrouble to retain the Bermuda instead of the carpet grass.\r\n\r\nAt McNeill the pasturage on areas that have long been closely grazed is\r\ncarpet grass. Unfortunately, no experiments have been conducted to\r\ncompare these two grasses as to ease of establishment and as to carrying\r\ncapacity. Carpet grass produces abundant good seed, and therefore\r\nspreads much more rapidly than Bermuda, which rarely produces seed in\r\nhumid regions.\r\n\r\nIt is found necessary to remove the stumps at McNeill, because for the\r\nfirst year or two on the plowed ground, weeds, especially \"fennel\" or\r\n\"Yankee weed,\" appear abundantly, and must be mowed or they will kill\r\nthe grasses by shading. Mowing with the stumps on the land is\r\nimpracticable, as the weeds conceal many of the stumps.\r\n\r\nWhether it is practicable to establish good permanent pastures without\r\nstumping and plowing the land is yet an unsolved problem. About every\r\nFlorida settlement where the town cattle graze, there is good pasture,\r\ncommonly carpet grass. You will find just this on the outskirts of\r\nJacksonville. Such pasturage has been established by heavy continuous\r\ngrazing, under which conditions the broom sedge and wire grass are\r\nexterminated, while the creeping carpet grass comes in and persists. It\r\nmay be that the manure of the animals is also a factor, and there can\r\nscarcely be a question that the trampling helps. As an example of this\r\nkind occurs about nearly every Florida town, it would seem as if it\r\ncould be duplicated on cattle ranches. I have suggested to several\r\ncattlemen that it is worth trying on a scale by three methods: (1)\r\nSimply burning the native grass in winter; (2) burning, followed by\r\ndisking or harrowing; and (3) plowing among the stumps.\r\n\r\nIf possible, carpet grass seed should be scattered on each area, and in\r\nall cases close grazing should be practiced. Unfortunately, carpet grass\r\nseed cannot be secured commercially, except in small quantities at high\r\nprices, but it is easy to cut the mature carpet grass in fall from a\r\npasture and cure the hay. The carpet grass can then be sown simply by\r\nscattering the hay. Whether any of these schemes will work out\r\nsatisfactorily still remains to be determined.\r\n\r\nAs to Natal grass, I have already mentioned that this succeeds better on\r\nthe poorer and drier pine lands than any other grass yet introduced.\r\nThus far it has been exploited purely as a grass for market hay. On this\r\nbasis many hundred acres were planted in Lake County and elsewhere.\r\nGrass culture purely for market hay is a very precarious proposition.\r\nThe proper agricultural economy is grass for live stock, selling only\r\nthe surplus to the market. Notwithstanding the very large acreage\r\nplanted to Natal, I have been quite unable to secure satisfactory data\r\nas to its value for pasturage, measured in carrying capacity and\r\nsatisfactory gains. It seems to me, from the slender data I have been\r\nable to secure, fairly probable that Natal will prove a valuable grass\r\nfor combined hay and pasture on the soils to which it is so well\r\nadapted, but of course it can hardly be expected to yield enough to\r\njustify the extravagant prices paid for land planted to Natal.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrairie Lands.\r\n\r\nOn the prairies of Florida there is much better natural pasturage than\r\nin the piney woods, and, indeed, it is on the prairies that the old type\r\nof cattle industry reached its highest development. The prairies are in\r\nreality wet meadows. Their grass cover is due to water relations, most\r\nof them being periodically overflowed--conditions that are inimical to\r\npines and palmettos. On the other hand, the period of overflow is too\r\nbrief to meet the conditions necessary for cypress and other swamp\r\ntrees. These prairies stretch from the border of the pine woods and\r\npalmettos on relatively high ground to permanently wet swamps. The best\r\nnatural pasturage consists of various species of paspalum and related\r\nflat-leaved grasses on the soils fairly moist during a large part of the\r\nyear; and maiden cane on still moister land, or even in shallow water.\r\nGenerally speaking, the moisture relations of the more extensive\r\nprairies are nearly ideal for continuous pasturage in the varying\r\nseasons. There is grave danger in any extensive drainage operations, as\r\npalmettos and pines will quickly invade such drained land, and thus\r\ndestroy the grass.\r\n\r\nFor improved pasture on these lands, particularly on those reasonably\r\nmoist, Para grass offers great possibilities. The remarkably rapid\r\ngrowth and high yield of this grass, combined with its palatability and\r\nnutritiousness, make it of prime importance in connection with better\r\nlive stock. Para succeeds well also on the better uplands, but,\r\ngenerally speaking, it is a grass for moist lands. The farther south,\r\nthe more valuable it is, as after frost it is of little value.\r\n\r\nAnother grass that is likely to be very valuable on the prairies, and,\r\nindeed, on the flatwoods and better uplands, is _paspalum dilatatum_,\r\nnative to Argentina. This is perhaps the best of the paspalums, and it\r\nis now widespread in the Southern States. Unfortunately, with us the\r\nseeds are largely destroyed by a fungus, but good commercial seed is\r\nobtainable in quantity from Australia.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuck Lands.\r\n\r\nOn the muck lands the problem of pasturage is easy. At least four\r\ngrasses, namely, Para, Carib, Rhodes and Bermuda, especially Giant\r\nBermuda, yield wonderfully. The enormous area of muck lands in Florida,\r\nespecially in the Everglades, can, it would seem, be utilized only with\r\nthe aid of livestock. While there may be some fairly difficult problems\r\nto solve in handling live stock on muck soils, especially in the wet\r\nseason, there can be little doubt that grass and live stock will insure\r\nthe permanency of these lands. Under continuous cultivation there is a\r\nconstant shrinkage in muck soils, but with grass and live stock this is\r\nnearly, if not quite, counterbalanced.\r\n\r\nCarib grass on muck soils is, from limited data, superior to Para grass\r\nboth in yield and quality. On other types of soil Para will outyield\r\nCarib. Rhodes grass does wonderfully on muck soil, and, indeed, on most\r\nrich soils. Giant Bermuda is far coarser and more vigorous than ordinary\r\nBermuda. It will succeed wherever ordinary Bermuda will grow, and, in\r\naddition, seems much better able to withstand flooding.\r\n\r\nTemporary or annual pasture crops are mainly important in connection\r\nwith swine raising. Various systems of such crops have been devised to\r\nfurnish successive pastures. Florida has a long list of such crops that\r\ncan be utilized. Among them are oats, rye, rape, sorghum, peanuts, cow\r\npeas, chufas, sweet potatoes, corn and velvet beans. Under certain\r\nconditions the cattleman may have to utilize one or more of these crops,\r\nbut corn and velvet beans is the one that is the most important.\r\n\r\nThe story of the velvet bean is really one of the romances of\r\nagriculture. Introduced into Florida about 1875 from some unknown\r\nsource, it first attracted attention as a forage about 1890. Until 1914\r\nit was but little grown outside of Florida. In 1915 the crop was\r\ncertainly less than 1,000,000 acres. In 1916 it had increased to\r\n2,500,000, and in 1917 to about 6,000,000 acres. The explanation of this\r\nremarkable increase was the finding of earlier \"sports.\" Three of these\r\nappeared independently--one in Alabama, two in Georgia. These early\r\nvarieties immensely increased the area over which the velvet bean can be\r\ngrown, so that now it embraces practically all of the cotton belt. These\r\nearly sports of the old Florida are most grown, but the Chinese velvet\r\nbean, introduced by the Department, and the hybrids developed by the\r\nFlorida Experiment Station, are important. In spite of vigorous search,\r\nthe native home of the Florida velvet bean yet remains unknown, but it\r\nis probably in the Indo-Malayan region of Southern Asia.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the velvet bean to the live stock industry now\r\ndeveloping in the South can scarcely be over-estimated. Grown with corn,\r\nit increases the corn crop year after year, and besides furnishes a\r\nlarge amount of nutritious feed to be eaten by the animals when the\r\ngrass pasture season is over. It reduces greatly the cost of finishing\r\nof beef animals for market. This year the velvet bean has been no small\r\nfactor in helping out the great shortage of foodstuffs, quantities of\r\nthem having been shipped to Texas. Finally, it has resulted in a new\r\nindustry for the South, namely, the manufacture of velvet bean meal,\r\nwhich has already won for itself a large demand.\r\n\r\n\r\nHay Plants.\r\n\r\nThe problem of producing hay in Florida is made particularly difficult\r\nby frequent rains, except in the fall of the year. The bulk of the hay\r\nnow produced is from the crab grass that volunteers in cultivated\r\nfields. In recent years much Natal hay has been grown for market. Para\r\ngrass hay is of good quality, and Rhodes grass of very fine quality.\r\nOther hays are made from cow peas, cow peas and sorghum mixed, Mexican\r\nclover, beggar-weed, oats, millet, etc.\r\n\r\nThe subject of hay, however, is vital only to the city market. To the\r\nlive stock man it is of minor importance, as silage furnishes so\r\nsatisfactory a substitute.\r\n\r\n\r\nEnsilage Crops.\r\n\r\nCorn is, of course, the standard crop for ensilage, and its relative\r\nimportance in Florida is not far different from that in other States.\r\n\r\nUnder certain conditions sorghums will yield greater tonnage than corn,\r\nand the resulting silage is but slightly inferior.\r\n\r\nFlorida possesses, in addition, a unique silage plant in Japanese sugar\r\ncane. The perennial nature of this plant and its high yielding capacity\r\nmake it a cheap fodder to grow. It may be utilized as green feed, as\r\nsilage, as dry fodder, or for pasture. Your own experiment station has\r\npublished the best information we have on this forage. As a feed for\r\ndairy cows there can be no question of its high value, either green or\r\nas silage. There still seems to be question, however, as to the relative\r\nvalue of Japanese cane silage as compared with corn silage. In Southern\r\nFlorida the cane stays green all winter, as a rule, so that there is no\r\nnecessity for ensiling it for winter feed. It may well prove, however,\r\nthat a supply of Japanese cane silage will prove good insurance against\r\nperiods of shortage even in South Florida.\r\n\r\nYou may have noted that all the pasture plants I have mentioned are\r\ngrasses. Very unfortunately we have not as yet any good perennial\r\npasture legume adapted to Florida. I say \"unfortunately\" because, as is\r\nwell known, the true grasses are nutritious in proportion to the\r\nfertility of the land. That is, the better the land the more nutritious\r\nthe pasture. But with legumes no such relations exist, because legumes\r\nare not dependent on the soil for their nitrogen supply.\r\n\r\nWhile we have no satisfactory perennial pasture legume, we have one\r\nsummer annual, lespedeza, that helps to some extent in North Florida.\r\nThere are also two winter annuals that reproduce themselves in which I\r\nhave considerable confidence, namely, burr clover and narrow-leaf vetch.\r\nI believe that on many of the better pasture soils, especially in North\r\nFlorida, that these legumes can be established and that they will\r\nre-seed themselves year after year. Of course due care must be taken to\r\nsecure inoculation, preferably by the soil method.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Outlook for New Forages.\r\n\r\nWhat the future may hold in store for us in the way of new forages does\r\nnot assist at the present time, but it is worth considering. It is well\r\nto bear in mind that the agriculture of the North, with the single\r\nimportant exception of corn, is mainly a direct inheritance from\r\nEuropean agriculture. Substitute root crops for corn and you have in\r\nessence the European practice. Southern agriculture, on the contrary, is\r\nalmost purely an American development--cotton, corn, tobacco, sweet\r\npotatoes, from the American Indian; cow peas, Rhodes grass, Natal grass\r\nand sorghum from South Africa; soy beans, lespedeza, Japanese cane from\r\nJapan; carpet grass and Para grass from the West Indies; Bermuda from\r\nIndia; velvet beans from Southern Asia.\r\n\r\nNorthern forage plants have been pretty thoroughly studied both in\r\nEurope and America, because European conditions are fairly like those of\r\nour Northern States. But there yet remains hosts of grasses and legumes\r\nadapted to sub-tropical climates concerning which we know practically\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\nOut of very numerous grasses and legumes at present under test are\r\nseveral that possess promise, and these I shall discuss briefly.\r\n\r\n\r\nKudzu.\r\n\r\nKudzu is not particularly new, but it seems to me destined to a much\r\ngreater importance than at present. It is the only perennial forage\r\nlegume that has in any sense made good in Florida. It is much better\r\nadapted to clayey soils than to sandy soils, but it also succeeds\r\nremarkably well on the limestone soils about Miami. On the better sandy\r\nsoils it would also seem to be valuable, but on the poorer sandy soils\r\nand poorly drained lands it is doubtful if it has a place. On clay soils\r\nat Arlington Farm, Va., we have consistently gotten two cuttings,\r\ntotaling five tons of hay per acre--double what we can get from cow peas\r\nor soy beans. I believe kudzu is entitled to a fair trial by every\r\nFlorida cattleman.\r\n\r\n\r\nNapier Grass.\r\n\r\nYou have doubtless seen some of the numerous references recently in\r\nFlorida papers to \"Japanese bamboo grass\" or \"Carter's grass\" as grown\r\nabout Arcadia. These names rest upon a misconception. The grass is a\r\nnative of South Africa, properly known as Napier grass, or _Pennisetum\r\nmacrostachyum_, introduced by the Department in 1913. This is a\r\nperennial much like Japanese cane, and in our tests is found hardy as\r\nfar north as Charleston. It does well on rather poor soil and yields\r\nheavy crops. In chemical analysis it is richer than corn in protein and\r\ncarbohydrates, but also contains three times as much fiber. It is this\r\nhigh fiber content or woody character that makes me dubious about its\r\nsilage value, in which opinion Professor Rolfs concurs. When two or\r\nthree feet high it is greedily eaten by animals, and so may be a\r\npasturage possibility. As a green feed crop it could be cut three or\r\nmore times each season, when three or four feet high, and I am sure will\r\nprove a very valuable forage for the man with one or two cows. Whether\r\nit is a crop for the stockman is still doubtful.\r\n\r\nIn 1916 we introduced a very similar species, _Pennisetum merkeri_,\r\nwhich is perhaps a little superior, though it is hard to tell the two\r\napart.\r\n\r\n\r\nMetake.\r\n\r\nThe name \"Japanese bamboo grass\" leads me to mention a true Japanese\r\nbamboo, the _metake_. This is a bamboo that spreads by rootstocks and\r\nforms dense thickets ten to fifteen feet high, much like cane brake,\r\nand, like our native cane, a valuable winter pasture plant. Mr. P. K.\r\nYonge has grown it with marked success about twenty miles north of\r\nPensacola. It seems to me a valuable plant to furnish a supply of\r\npasturage in winter, when pasturage is practically gone. It is worthy of\r\ncareful trial on all well-drained Florida soils.\r\n\r\n\r\nTripsacum Laxum.\r\n\r\nLast year we secured from Guatemala a new perennial grass which, if it\r\nproves winter hardy, will, I am certain, be of enormous value to South\r\nFlorida. This grass grows much like teosinte, but is stouter and very\r\nmuch more leafy. The stem is tender, sweet and juicy, and all the leaves\r\nremain green. It is an ideal silage plant. So far as I am aware, our\r\ntrial at Miami is the first time this grass has ever been cultivated.\r\nThe few live stock men who have seen it went into ecstasies. It may\r\nprove valuable, however, only for frostless regions.\r\n\r\n\r\nCreeping Pasture Grasses.\r\n\r\nAt the present time we have under trial five creeping pasture grasses,\r\nmore or less like Bermuda in a general way. You are, of course, aware\r\nthat a pasture grass to be valuable should be able to spread naturally\r\nand must be able to hold the ground. Naturally it takes time to\r\ndetermine all these facts. The five grasses I refer to are as follows:\r\n\r\nBlue Couch (_Digitaria didactyla_). This is much like Bermuda, but\r\nproduces abundant good seed. For lawns and pastures it promises to be\r\nabout equally as valuable as Bermuda.\r\n\r\nManilla Grass (_Osterdamia matrella_). This is especially adapted to\r\nrather moist sandy lands. It grows very dense, and where it thrives\r\nshould be valuable.\r\n\r\nLovi-lovi (_Chrysopogon aciculatus_). This furnishes much pasturage in\r\nIndia, the Philippines, and South China. The seeds are very abundant,\r\nand each sticks into the clothing like a pin. But about Hongkong it is\r\nused generally as a lawn grass. It is well adapted to dry sandy soils.\r\nIf it proves well adapted to Florida we can, I think, chance its\r\nbecoming a nuisance, because if it does thrive it will give much\r\npasture.\r\n\r\nNilghiri Grass (_Andropogon emersus_). This is the only creeping grass\r\nof the genus Andropogon (which includes our broom sedges) that we have\r\nyet found. I secured it in the Nilghiri Hills of South India. It looks\r\npromising.\r\n\r\nKikuyu Grass (_Pennisetum sp._). This is native to the highlands of\r\nUganda, in British East Africa, and in South Africa has created great\r\ninterest. It looks much like St. Augustine grass. At Biloxi, Miss., it\r\nhas succeeded well. It looked very fine at Arlington, Va., but could not\r\nstand the winter. This grass is said to be very nutritious, and I\r\nbelieve that on the better soils of Florida it will prove a real\r\nacquisition.\r\n\r\nI mention these new things to give you some idea of what we are doing. I\r\nmight mention several others that look good to us, but it will be time\r\nto speak when we have tried them further. In brief, we are scouring the\r\nearth to find grasses and legumes to meet Florida's needs. We have faith\r\nthat the grasses and legumes exist, if we only can find them.\r\n\r\nGentlemen, in closing I must say one thing more. Our country is at\r\nwar--a war that will tax our energies and resources to the uttermost. No\r\nmore dangerous idea can be entertained than to minimize the task, or to\r\ndelude ourselves with the prospect of an early peace.\r\n\r\nOne important factor is food, especially meat and wheat. Only an\r\nunusually favorable season can produce for us as much wheat as last\r\nyear. Our meat and forage supplies are low, because in times of food\r\nscarcity, grass crops are necessarily sacrificed. Gentlemen, you can do\r\nmuch to help increase the meat supply. In developing your ranches to\r\nincrease your output, I want to urge as a patriotic duty that you\r\nincrease your good pasturage and your winter feed supply as rapidly as\r\nyou can. I could not urge this in peace times, because rapid development\r\nis never the most economical. But in this time of stress you cattlemen\r\ncan help the nation most by increasing your output to the maximum. There\r\nis no other way for you to give to the nation that will count so much. I\r\ntherefore urge that you brush aside all questions as to the economically\r\nbest method of increasing pasturage and forage, and to devote all your\r\ncapital and all your energy to doing this along any lines that are\r\nsure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORIDA AS SEEN FROM A TEXAS STANDPOINT.\r\n\r\n     _Address by W. N. Waddell of Fort Worth, Texas, before the\r\n     Florida State Live Stock Association, January 9, 1918._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Waddell started to working cattle on the Texas ranges in 1875, and\r\nhas been in the cattle business for himself since 1881._\r\n\r\n_He was chairman of the Live Stock Sanitary Commission of Texas for four\r\nyears, and for a number of years has been the Texas representative of\r\nthe Live Stock Exchange National Bank of Chicago, and of the Chicago\r\nCattle Loan Company._\r\n\r\n_After spending a week in Florida during August of 1917, Mr. Waddell\r\nreturned to the State in November and spent considerable time\r\ninvestigating the opportunities for raising cattle. This address gives\r\nhis views on the advantages Florida possesses as a cattle-producing\r\nstate._\r\n\r\nIn order to understand or to be able to appreciate a proposition of\r\nalmost any character it is necessary to approach it by comparison, and\r\nin making comparisons touching Florida I wish to state that I have\r\ntraveled over the range of the five northern states of old Mexico; I\r\nhave traveled over the southern part of the range belt of Arizona; I\r\nhave traveled over about half of the state of New Mexico and virtually\r\nall of Texas, and I find in Florida conditions favorable to the\r\nproduction of live stock that do not exist in any of the states I have\r\nnamed, which constitute the great range belt of the Southwest. In Mexico\r\nthere is very little water, and water is very hard to get by digging,\r\nthe wells averaging from 150 to 1,000 feet deep, and in a great many\r\ninstances no water at all. In Mexico they also have a great many animals\r\nthat prey on the live stock, such as panthers, lobo wolves, bears, as\r\nwell as the common, ordinary coyote. None of these have to be contended\r\nwith here.\r\n\r\nIn Arizona and New Mexico about the same conditions prevail as do in\r\nnorthern Old Mexico. In Texas we have bears and sundry pests to prey on\r\nour live stock. The prairie dog infests a great many of our ranches,\r\ndestroying the grass, digging holes in the ground, and making it\r\ndangerous for the cowboy to ride over in the pursuit of his range\r\nendeavors. We have wolves of all species. In Texas we have also the\r\nscrew worms that are a tax on the live stock producer to the extent of\r\nfrom two to five per cent of the calves born on his ranch, and I am\r\nsorry to say that worst of all we have periodical droughts. None of\r\nthese adverse conditions I find prevail in Florida.\r\n\r\nHere I find the country covered with a thick, heavy coat of grass,\r\nstreams running with plenty of water and I understand where natural\r\nwater is not available that it is only about from twenty to one hundred\r\nfeet to an abundant supply of water under the ground, making the\r\nproposition of watering the ranches in Florida, where artificial water\r\nis necessary, a very simple matter. The climate in Florida is temperate\r\nand mild, rainfall is regular and abundant, and, so far as the\r\nproduction of forage for live stock on the range is concerned, your\r\nrainfall and your soils all seem to combine in favor of the producer of\r\nlive stock.\r\n\r\nI never was more amazed in my life than I was last summer, when, in\r\ncompany with a committee of other cattle men from Texas, I visited this\r\nstate. At that time I was shown over the southern middle part of\r\nFlorida; was shown a great domain of country lying out of doors, as it\r\nwere and as we term it in Texas, furnishing free range for hundreds of\r\nthousands of cattle. I did not believe my ears when I was told those\r\nconditions existed here, and I can't understand yet why a state as old\r\nas Florida, with as many surface indications of possibilities for the\r\nproduction of live stock, should remain unfenced, unoccupied, and\r\nnon-revenue producing to the men who own the land.\r\n\r\nAnother surprise that met us when we came to Florida in the summer was\r\nthe absolute lack of any improvement in the live stock that we found\r\nhere. In fact, it is my judgment that the cattle in Florida today, from\r\nwhat I have read of the history of Florida, are not as good as they were\r\nthirty years ago, and I am surprised, when I think of the facilities\r\nfurnished the cattle men of Florida by the land owners for the grazing\r\nof their cattle, that they haven't taken any more interest in their\r\ncattle than they have and tried to improve them.\r\n\r\nFlorida today, as never before, is attracting national attention as a\r\npossible beef-producing state. The eyes of the investing public are\r\nturned toward Florida, and it is my judgment that within the next five\r\nyears Florida will make greater strides in the development of the live\r\nstock industry than it has ever made before. And I want here and now to\r\nissue a warning to you gentlemen who are running your cattle on the open\r\nranges of Florida that you had better get busy and get control of what\r\nland you expect to use as a cattle ranch, for if I mistake not,\r\noutsiders are coming into this state who will buy or lease these lands,\r\nput them under fence and inaugurate a system of live stock production on\r\nan improved basis as compared to the present methods being pursued in\r\nthis state.\r\n\r\nAnd in this connection I wish to state that I have discussed this open\r\nrange proposition with some of the largest land owners in Florida. They\r\ntell me that they want to see Florida developed; they tell me they are\r\nin line to lend their energies, their time and their money to anything\r\nthat will develop the State of Florida. After listening to them talk\r\nthis line of earnest progressiveness, I have put the proposition to them\r\njust like it was put to us in Texas, and that is, formulate an equitable\r\nleasing proposition, one that will safeguard the interests of the land\r\nowner, and at the same time lend protection to the vested rights of the\r\nlessee, and advertise that to the world. Let the people not only of\r\nFlorida, but the people outside of the State of Florida, know that they\r\ncan come to Florida and at a small rental cost, lease as many acres of\r\ngood grazing land as they have money to get cattle with which to stock\r\nit, assuring the prospective lessee that they will fence the land\r\naccording to his desires and will build him a ranch house to live in;\r\nthat they will fence him a horse pasture to keep his saddle horses in;\r\nwill build him a dipping vat on the land, and where necessary will bore\r\nwells and equip them with windmill and pump sufficient to furnish plenty\r\nof water for the live stock on the land so leased.\r\n\r\nThere was never any marked development or marked improvement in the live\r\nstock industry in the State of Texas as long as the cattle ranged on the\r\nfree grass, but in 1884 the Legislature passed what was known as a Lease\r\nLaw. Then it was, gentlemen, that the fencing up of the State of Texas\r\nbegan in earnest. No man was willing to pay lease on land and let\r\nsomebody else's cattle graze on it. And that is the first step needed to\r\nbe taken in the evolution of better cattle in Florida. The land owners\r\nshould fence up their lands, cut them up in pastures to suit the men who\r\nwant to run their cattle on them, making the lands of Florida\r\nrevenue-producing, instead of being a liability, and put the cattle of\r\nFlorida under fence and under control wherein individual effort may\r\ndevelop in a desire to excel. I can not stress this proposition too\r\nstrongly. I haven't the language to express the importance of putting\r\nthe lands of Florida under fence and the cattle under control in order\r\nthat better cattle and more cattle may be raised. The most important\r\nstep looking to better cattle in Florida has already been taken in the\r\ncreation of a Live Stock Sanitary Board and the work incident thereto of\r\ntick eradication. This work and the efforts of the Florida State Live\r\nStock Sanitary Board will be much more effective and easier of\r\naccomplishment when you get the ranges of Florida fenced and the cattle\r\nunder control.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that Florida has been overlooked. I am led to the belief\r\nthat the Florida cowmen have been lulled to sleep, as it were, by the\r\nfact that they haven't been bothered by any outside influences. In\r\ndiscussing the breeding up or improving of the cattle with a good many\r\nbreeders whom I have met in this State, I find that all voice the\r\nsentiment that they would like to raise better cattle; that the State\r\nought to produce better cattle; and that it is a good cattle country.\r\n\r\nFlorida is wasting approximately enough good pasture to produce a meat\r\nsupply sufficient to feed several states by confining the quality of the\r\nherds to the little native cattle we saw on the ranges. True, we saw\r\nlots of cattle, more than I supposed existed in the entire State, but\r\nthe opportunity before the cattle men is to breed up the quality and\r\nsize. That this can be done was demonstrated by some herds we visited,\r\nand the reports on those herds show that this is a better cattle\r\nbreeding country than Texas, for your owners are branding a larger\r\nproportion of calves to breeding cows in herds than we are able to get.\r\n\r\nI am sure that good cattle can be raised in Florida because I have seen\r\nthem. I am sure that good hogs can be raised in Florida because I have\r\nseen them, and on the question of the hog, I wish to state that on the\r\nopen range country of Florida, especially the southern part in the\r\nprairie country, where there are hard wood and cabbage hammocks, is the\r\nideal country in which to grow hogs. I made the statement when I was\r\nhere in the summer that I believed a man could fence up a range of ten\r\nor twenty or thirty thousand acres in Florida, stock it with cattle and\r\nstock it with hogs, and that I believed the hogs would pay the overhead\r\ncharges of running the ranch, and my observations here for the past\r\nthirty days traveling over the State have convinced me that that\r\nstatement was not very much exaggerated.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why cattle men should not make dividends on\r\ninvestments while breeding up the quality of their herds, for this is a\r\ngreat cattle country.\r\n\r\nI am very much surprised to find that sheep are not more generally\r\nhandled on the ranges with the cattle. The absence of coyotes make sheep\r\nraising particularly attractive, and they will not injure the cattle\r\npasturage if properly proportioned. There ought to be several hundred\r\nthousand sheep on the Kissimmee River Valley ranges. We handle large\r\nnumbers of sheep and cattle together, although our ranges are not nearly\r\nso good as those in Florida.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I will state that I think Florida offers the best field\r\nfor live stock production along improved lines of any State in America.\r\nThat is, cattle can be raised here cheaper and with less uncertainty\r\nthan any place I know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GLANCE BACKWARD AND FORWARD.\r\n\r\n     _Annual Address before the Florida State Live Stock\r\n     Association, January 8, 1918, by Dr. W. F. Blackman,\r\n     President of the Association._\r\n\r\n\r\nNever before have we met in circumstances so extraordinary and under the\r\nstress of thoughts and emotions so many, so various, so conflicting and\r\nperplexing as today. Our minds are engrossed and appalled by the world\r\ncatastrophe into which we have been plunged. Since our last meeting,\r\nlife for every man and woman of us has been changed in all its major\r\naspects and fallen into disorder. All the peaceful routine of our\r\nthoughts and habits has been upset. Our sons and neighbors are on their\r\nway to the hideous and heroic and bloody work abroad to which they have\r\nbeen summoned. * * *\r\n\r\nBut disquieting as are the times, the business of the stock raiser in\r\nAmerica, and particularly in Florida, was never on so sound a basis as\r\ntoday, never so full of promise. The exhaustion of domestic animals\r\nthroughout Europe and the increasing shortage in our own country are\r\ncreating a demand which will insure for many years to come a profitable\r\nmarket for all the beef, pork, mutton and dairy products which we can\r\nsupply.\r\n\r\nDefinitely, I think it can be said that there can be no danger of\r\noverproduction in these lines for a long time to come. And for this\r\nindustry, which we may perhaps properly call the most ancient,\r\nfundamental, necessary, stable, wholesome, honorable and delightful of\r\nall the occupations in which men are engaged, Florida has advantages of\r\nsoil, climate, rainfall and location greater, on the whole, than those\r\nenjoyed by any other state of the American union. This is being\r\nrecognized in increasing measure, far and wide. The eyes of discerning\r\nand experienced men are being turned this way as never before. Inquiries\r\nby mail and visits of exploration from the North, the West and the\r\nSouthwest have never before been so numerous as during the year which we\r\nare reviewing, and our own people are awakening to the opportunities\r\nwhich lie all about them, unused and inviting.\r\n\r\nThere are vast areas of cheap and hitherto waste lands in every part of\r\nthe State, lying open the year round to the genial and fructifying rays\r\nof a semi-tropical and sub-tropical sun, which need only the expenditure\r\nupon them of money and labor to fit them for the support of herds and\r\nflocks greater than any other region can maintain. We have every reason,\r\nas we face the new year, to take courage and to gird ourselves for the\r\ntask of turning into reality these gracious possibilities which nature\r\nhas spread about us with a lavish hand.\r\n\r\nThe past year has been signalized by one great achievement, carrying two\r\nothers in its train. The great achievement to which I refer, the\r\ngreatest by all odds ever accomplished in this State, is the creation by\r\nthe Legislature of a State Live Stock Sanitary Board and the\r\nappropriation of public monies for the carrying on of its work; and the\r\ntwo consequent achievements are the beginning of definite, determined,\r\nstatewide, co-operative and adequately supported efforts to eradicate\r\nthe pestilent cattle tick from all our borders and to control hog\r\ncholera. * * *\r\n\r\nAnd I venture now to say--and I say it with pardonable pride and great\r\npleasure--that no state in the Union has a more carefully considered,\r\nbetter balanced and guarded, and more rigid and effective law, covering\r\nthe matter of live stock sanitation, than has Florida. Perhaps a detail\r\nhere and there needs to be amended and strengthened, but, on the whole,\r\nthe measure was a good one and is working well. * * *\r\n\r\nI may add, finally, that the State Live Stock Sanitary Board, in the two\r\ngreat undertakings to which, for the present and the immediate future,\r\nit will, of necessity, chiefly devote its energies, the eradication of\r\nthe cattle tick and the control of hog cholera, we are leaning heavily\r\non two co-operative agencies. The first of these is the Federal\r\nGovernment, through its Bureau of Animal Industry, and the States\r\nRelations Service.\r\n\r\nIn Dr. E. M. Nighbert, inspector in charge of the work of tick\r\neradication; Dr. A. H. Logan, inspector in charge for hog cholera\r\ncontrol; Dean P. H. Rolfs of the University, director of the Experiment\r\nStation, in charge of the work in Florida of the States Relations\r\nService, and the numerous assistants placed by the Federal Government,\r\nunder the direction of these three gentlemen, we have a large body of\r\ncapable, trained and energetic experts, whose co-operation with our\r\nBoard is of inestimable value to the State, and whose maintenance costs\r\nus nothing.\r\n\r\nThe members of the State Live Stock Sanitary Board serve without\r\nremuneration, so that we have in Florida approximately thirty men who\r\nare engaged in promoting the work of live stock sanitation without\r\nexpense to the taxpayers of the State. It is fitting, I think, that this\r\nAssociation should be reminded of this very great and very costly, but\r\nnevertheless wholly gratuitous, service which is being rendered to the\r\ninterests which we represent. * * *\r\n\r\nSo much for the past year; now for a glance forward.\r\n\r\nWhat I have just been saying indicates clearly the special work to which\r\nwe ought, in my judgment, to devote ourselves in the immediate future--I\r\nmean the complete and final eradication of the tick in every county in\r\nFlorida and the largest possible measure of control of hog cholera. If\r\nwe see clearly, we see that these tasks are preliminary to all others. *\r\n* *\r\n\r\nFortunately the tick is a very weak and vulnerable enemy, though so\r\nmischievous. Put all the cattle of Florida through the dipping vat once\r\na fortnight for five or six months, and there would be no more ticks\r\nleft in this State than there are snakes in Ireland. Let us consecrate\r\nourselves here in this meeting to the doing of this thing, and doing it\r\n_soon_.\r\n\r\nHog cholera is not so simple and manageable an affair. In the\r\nmicro-organism which causes this disease, we face an enemy far subtler,\r\nmore cunning, more elusive, more persistent and more swiftly fatal than\r\nis the tick. It escapes observation by the most powerful microscope; it\r\nlaughs at quarantine lines; it flows in the stream; it lurks in the\r\npool; it rides upon the foot of beast and bird, the shoe of man, the\r\nwagon's wheel; it soars aloft on the buzzard's wing; you can not catch\r\nand dip it.\r\n\r\nI earnestly advise the formation of local live stock associations\r\nthroughout the State, at least one in each county affiliated with the\r\nState Association, and having special committees on Tick Eradication and\r\nHog Cholera Control, composed of the ablest, the most energetic and the\r\nmost influential men in the various communities. Let these associations\r\nhold meetings at regular intervals for the free exchange of views and\r\nexperiences; let expert and interesting speakers from abroad bring to\r\nthese meetings fresh information and impetus; let there be added such\r\nsocial and entertaining features as may be available--music, barbecues,\r\nmoving pictures, boat excursions, what-not--to attract the multitude,\r\nrelieve the monotony of farm life, and increase neighborliness and good\r\ncommunity feeling. Let the co-operation of the banks of the region be\r\nsecured, for the generous financing of pig clubs and corn clubs. * * *\r\n\r\nThere is one other matter of prime importance to which I invite your\r\nattention. If the live stock industry of Florida is to be put on the\r\nmost stable basis and developed with reasonable rapidity, immense sums\r\nof money will be required. Fences must be built; drainage canals and\r\nditches must be dug; improved and more nourishing grasses must be\r\nintroduced over vast areas; other great areas must be planted with\r\nforage crops; silos must be built; plows, harrows and other expensive\r\nimplements must be purchased; horses, mules and tractors, herdsmen,\r\nfarmers and laborers must be secured and put to work in great numbers; a\r\nmultitude of pure-bred bulls and cows, boars and sows, rams and ewes,\r\nstallions, jacks and mares must be imported for the improvement of our\r\nnative stock.\r\n\r\nWhere are the necessary funds coming from for the financing of those\r\nenterprises? Perhaps the large ranch owners can take care of themselves,\r\nbut what our State needs above all things else is thrifty farmers by the\r\nthousand, now on the ground or drawn from other states by our surpassing\r\nadvantages of soil and climate; where shall these secure the funds\r\nnecessary for the development of their more modest holdings?\r\n\r\nFlorida is a relatively new and scantily populated State; there are here\r\nno great reserves of cash and securities, accumulated and bequeathed by\r\ngenerations of toiling and thrifty ancestors, as in some parts of the\r\ncountry. Many of the banks are doing their best to care for our live\r\nstock interests, but the ability of our local banks--and I speak now as\r\na banker--is strictly limited in this direction.\r\n\r\nWhat we need in Florida, in my judgment, as the very next step to be\r\ntaken, is one or more strong cattle loan companies, such as flourish in\r\nthe West, whose sole business it will be to provide the funds necessary\r\nfor the developments which I have mentioned, so far as cattle are\r\nconcerned. This is a matter which will occupy us during one entire\r\nsession of this meeting, and I need not, therefore, deal with it further\r\nnow, except to say that the present time seems especially propitious for\r\nthe securing of such funds as we need for this business.\r\n\r\nMen are asking how they may make safe investment of their savings in\r\nthese troubled times; the future of the railways, now under Government\r\ncontrol, is uncertain; industrial enterprises have been largely thrown\r\ninto abnormal condition by the war; stocks, bonds and other similar\r\nsecurities have in them today a considerable speculative element which\r\ngives pause to conservative investors. But amid all this flux and\r\nuncertainty, here lies the land, as from of old, unchanging, peaceful,\r\nfruitful, a mother's full breast, and upon the land feed and grow,\r\nenriching and renewing it forever even as they feed upon it, the\r\nfriendly animals, whose flesh and milk support our life from the cradle\r\nto the grave.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing speculative here, and I am confident that investors,\r\nperplexed now by the unheard of aspect of the world's affairs, will be\r\ndisposed to put their funds more and more into the soil and its\r\nproducts, if they are shown the way; and the cattle-loan company,\r\norganized and administered by experienced and careful men, can show them\r\nthe way and lead them safely in it.\r\n\r\nAnd now, gentlemen, we will proceed to the program our Executive\r\nCommittee has provided. I hope that our meeting together, the messages\r\nwhich will be brought us from abroad, and the various discussions in\r\nwhich we ourselves shall engage, will serve to hearten us for our work\r\nand help us to feel, amid the toil and perplexities of our daily task,\r\nthat in providing a more copious supply of food for the world, in\r\ncausing two blades of grass to grow where one grew before, and in\r\ntransforming these blades of grass by the mysterious and wonderful\r\nprocesses of nature into the thoughts and loves of men and women, the\r\norator's speech, the poet's song, the statesman's wisdom, the soldier's\r\nfierce energy, the mother's brooding care, and the babe's new life, we\r\nare doing our part to support and render more rich and worthy this\r\nwondrous human drama and are partners with God in the work of his\r\nearthly kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFLORIDA SUITED TO EXTENSIVE CATTLE RAISING.\r\n\r\nTexas Ranchmen Declare Conditions Ideal for Cattle, Sheep and Goats.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe impression made upon a prominent Texas ranch owner who recently\r\nvisited the great cattle ranges of Florida was that Nature has been too\r\ngood to the cattle industry in this State to encourage improvement in\r\nthe crude methods of breeding and handling stock which have been in\r\nvogue for years, for the cattle owners have made money without trying.\r\n\r\nAmong those who spent a week during the latter part of August inspecting\r\nrange conditions were M. Sansom of Fort Worth, president of the\r\nCassidy-Southwestern Commission Co., director of the Federal Reserve\r\nBank and owner of large cattle ranch interests. * * *\r\n\r\nMr. Sansom expressed his impression of Florida's opportunity for raising\r\ncattle in these words:\r\n\r\n\"The only trouble you have in Florida, Nature has been too good to you.\r\nIf it had done half as much for Texas the Government officials would not\r\nnow be worrying about the future meat supply for the United States and\r\nour Allies. I have seen Texas when the cattle were no better than the\r\ngrade I have seen on this trip. We started twenty-five years ago to\r\nimprove our herds and stayed with it, until today we furnish some of the\r\nbest breeding and feeding cattle for the Northern States.\r\n\r\n\"Florida now has very great advantage over pioneer Texas, as you can get\r\nsome of our good breeding stock and make rapid progress breeding up your\r\nherds. The Osceola Cattle Co., in Osceola County, has started along\r\nright lines, and the manager gave me some figures on calf production\r\nwhich show that his herd are producing a larger percentage of calves\r\nthan we get in Texas.\r\n\r\n\"But your luxuriant range grasses and abundance of stock water are\r\nalmost unbelievable. Your range will carry from three to ten times as\r\nmany cattle per section as the Texas land in a normal year. And when I\r\nsay normal year I want you to remember that sometimes the rain clouds\r\nforget all about Texas for months at a time, and then our ranges suffer\r\nfrom drought, as large sections of them are doing at this time.\r\n\r\n\"You have a sheep country as good as exists, and a goat country better\r\nthan any other. It is too bad that you do not raise more sheep on your\r\nranges, for they do not hurt the cattle pastures, eating only the tender\r\nblades down under the more mature grass. We run thousands of sheep on\r\nour cattle ranges in Texas. The goats will be a distinct benefit to the\r\nFlorida ranges, as they do not eat much grass when they can get\r\nunderbrush, briars and weeds. By having those cleaned out of the\r\npastures the grass will have a better chance to grow.\r\n\r\n\"I am informed that Florida does not have to combat coyotes, which are\r\nour worst sheep enemies, so you really have no serious losses to\r\nanticipate on your sheep investments. And yet there are very few sheep\r\non the ranges we have visited. It is to be hoped that your cattlemen\r\nwill use more sheep on the ranges.\r\n\r\n\"The range country should become the calf incubator for the Southeastern\r\nStates, the offspring being sold at weaning time or as yearlings. That\r\nwill give your ranges a larger carrying capacity for breeding stock and\r\nlet the grain-producing sections do the finishing.\"--_From the\r\nManufacturers' Record, Sept. 13, 1917._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCATTLE RAISING IN FLORIDA.\r\n\r\n     As I Saw it on a Thousand-mile Tour of the Central Part of\r\n     the State.\r\n\r\n_By A. C. Williams._\r\n\r\n\r\nWasn't it Saul who went out in search of asses and found a kingdom? You\r\nmen who are familiar with the Bible can answer that. But I can testify\r\nthat I, while not in search of asses, duplicated Saul's experience\r\nduring the past month, when, in company with M. Sansom, W. N. Waddell,\r\nCaesar Kleberg and Tom T. East of Texas, Dr. L. J. Allen of Oklahoma,\r\nGeo. M. Rommel of Washington, P. L. Sutherland, C. L. Gaines and J. G.\r\nBoyd of Florida, I had the pleasure of a thousand-mile trip through the\r\ncentral part of the State of Florida.\r\n\r\nNature has been very kind to Florida, providing delightful climate,\r\nfertile lands and adequate rainfall for farming purposes; broad\r\nprairies, carpeted with succulent grasses and watered by running streams\r\nfor live stock raising; timber galore for sawmills, and countless beauty\r\nspots beckoning to tourists. But the citizens of that State have been\r\nslow to take advantage of their opportunities. Agriculture in many\r\nsections has been a neglected art. Practically all of the foodstuffs,\r\nincluding grain, meat, butter and eggs, have been produced outside the\r\nState. Colonization companies have devoted their energies to boosting\r\norange orchards and truck gardens (the \"poker game of agriculture\"), and\r\nlittle organized effort has been made to attract farmers and stockmen of\r\ntireless energy--the backbone of any community.\r\n\r\nAmong the neglected industries, none stand out more conspicuously than\r\nstock raising. The native cattle, inbred, stunted specimens of doubtful\r\norigin, have been turned loose on the free, open range to rustle for\r\nthemselves, and little effort has been made in most sections toward\r\nbreed improvement. Due to the mild climate, good range, adequate water\r\nsupply and absence of screw worms, coyotes and other pests, they have\r\nsurvived. And with open range and no expense they have been very\r\nprofitable. In our entire trip we saw only two or three flocks of sheep\r\nand goats. They were of better quality than I had expected--fairly good\r\nfor mutton, but light on wool.\r\n\r\nA new era is dawning for the cattle business of Florida. The war has\r\nforced a reduction in the exports of turpentine and rosin, and the large\r\nland owners are turning their attention to improved stock raising. A\r\npacking house has been erected at Jacksonville. Systematic tick\r\neradication is being carried on. Large tracts of land have been fenced\r\nand stocked. Hundreds of well-bred Texas cows and registered Hereford,\r\nAngus, Shorthorn and Brahma bulls are being purchased, and the work of\r\nbreed improvement is growing in popularity.\r\n\r\nGood feed and forage crops can be grown in most sections, and with this\r\nnew movement for improved live stock will come deeper interest in\r\nagriculture. The chief forage crops now produced in that State are corn,\r\nvelvet beans, Japanese cane, sorghum, cow peas and beggar-weed. The\r\nfirst three perhaps take the lead. The corn and velvet beans are planted\r\ntogether, in rows from four to six feet apart. The beans grow very rank,\r\nproducing an abundance of good hay, and beans which are high in feeding\r\nvalue. The beans may be left on the vines for pasturage, or gathered and\r\nground into bean meal, which is excellent for cattle feeding. Japanese\r\ncane resembles our Texas ribbon cane. It makes good silage, keeps well\r\nand is highly relished by cattle. The Florida beggar-weed grows as a\r\nvolunteer in old fields of a light sandy soil. If cut at the right time\r\nit makes good hay, and, while it is rather bulky for silage alone, it is\r\nsaid to add greatly to the fattening value of silage. Corn and cow peas\r\nneed no introduction to our readers.\r\n\r\nThe most common grasses are several varieties of paspalum or carpet\r\ngrass, switch grass, wire grass, little blue maiden cane and Bermuda.\r\nCrab and Natal grass are volunteers which follow crops on sandy soils.\r\nBoth Guinea and Para grasses thrive in South Florida, where less liable\r\nto injury by frost. Fort Thompson grass, which resembles giant Bermuda,\r\nwith larger joint, stem and leaf, is a native of Florida, which will\r\nsome day be recognized as one of their very best pasture grasses.\r\n\r\nWith their open range and native cattle--a poorer grade than our\r\nold-time longhorn--the cattle business of Florida today may be compared\r\nto that of Texas twenty years ago. What they need is more bulls and\r\nexperienced cattlemen who will apply the intelligence, energy and\r\npersistence that know not failure.\r\n\r\nLeaving Kenansville at 8:15, we were soon out on the Kissimmee prairie\r\nof thousands and thousands of acres of open range. Here, where the grass\r\nwas very luxuriant, resembling a hay meadow, we saw several hundred more\r\nof the small native cattle, followed by the common scrubby bulls. The\r\nfat four-year-old steers weighed around 550 pounds, and are valued at\r\n$30 per head. The cows weighed around 500 pounds. The range herds of\r\nmixed ages and classes are valued at $20 per head. We soon left the\r\npublic highway, circling marshes and dodging palmettos. Our next stop\r\nwas on Gum Slough Ranch, where we were told that on a pasture of 10,000\r\nacres there were 6,000 cattle. The ground was well covered with carpet\r\nand a variety of other grasses, and did not show the effects of close\r\ngrazing. The cattle were in good condition and of better quality than\r\nmost of the others which we had inspected.--_From The Cattleman,\r\nSeptember, 1917._",
