A FRIEND IN NEED\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAS IT WAS IN THE BEGINNING\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nA TRUSTED MESSENGER\r\n\r\nGrenville was not the type to be readily excited, yet a glow of\r\nexceptional brilliance shone in his eyes as he met the searching gaze\r\nof his friend, and wondered if Fenton could be jesting.\r\n\r\nThat he had made no reply whatsoever to Fenton's proposition he failed\r\nto realize till Gerald spoke again.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Sid,\" demanded that impetuous lieutenant of finance, \"gone dumb?\r\nPerhaps I haven't made it plain,\" and he particularized on his fingers.\r\n\"You get an ocean trip of eight or ten weeks' duration, tropic sun at\r\nits best, leisurely business without a fleck of bother, absolute rest,\r\ngood provender, thorough recuperation, your entire expenses cheerfully\r\npaid, vast service rendered to me, no time lost on your equilibrator,\r\ntime for countless new inventions to sprout in your fertile brain--and\r\nthe unutterable joy of escaping this abominable climate, practically at\r\nonce!\"\r\n\r\nGrenville's smile, still brightly boyish, despite the many reverses and\r\nhardships of his six and twenty years, came creeping to his eyes.  His\r\nwan face suggested a tint of color.\r\n\r\n\"Don't wake me up for a moment, Fen,\" he answered.  \"I haven't dreamed\r\nanything like it for years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dreamed?\" repeated Fenton, resuming his interrupted pacing up and down\r\nthe rug, where the firelight reddened his profile.  \"Does that mean you\r\nlike it?--you'll go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Would Cinderella go to a ball?\" replied the still incredulous\r\nGrenville, half seriously.  \"What's the joker, old chap?  What is the\r\nworst that could happen at the midnight stroke of twelve?\"\r\n\r\nFenton came at once and laid his hands on the broad, bony shoulders of\r\nhis friend.\r\n\r\n\"Have I ever played a joker with you yet?\" said he.  \"Never mind the\r\napology.  I forgive you.  I understand the compliment.  Proposal sounds\r\ntoo good to be true, and all that sort of rubbish.  The fact is, old\r\nman, I want you to go to Canton, China, and bring home my affianced\r\nbride.  That's absolutely all there is to the business.  You need the\r\nchange and voyage; I haven't the time to go out there and fetch her\r\nmyself.  Elaine is alone in that heathenish country, miserably\r\nheartsick over her uncle's sudden death.  She wishes to return at once.\r\nI can't let the poor girl come alone.  I've no one in the world but you\r\nI'd care to send--and there you are.\"\r\n\r\nThe glow departed from Grenville's eyes.  His doubts of any proposition\r\nwith a woman in the case lurked deep in his level gaze.  His face\r\nbecame once more the rugged mask with which he had so long confronted a\r\nworld persistently gray.  The smile he summoned to his lips was more\r\nquizzical than mirthful.\r\n\r\n\"It sounds perfectly simple,\" he replied.  \"But--you know there are\r\nseveral tales, recorded in prose and verse, of kings who have sent a\r\ntrusted messenger on precisely such an errand.  The joker somehow\r\nmanaged to get into play.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so,\" agreed Fenton, readily.  \"Three or four times in a thousand\r\ncases the girl and the--er--messenger rather thoughtlessly--well, a\r\ncomplication arises.  The percentage, however, is excessively low.\r\nWe'll consider that a negligible possibility.  You see, I know both you\r\nand Elaine, and I am not a king.  The question is--will you go?\"\r\n\r\nGrenville was always amused by Fenton's arguments.\r\n\r\n\"I have seen no statistics on the subject,\" he admitted.  \"In this\r\nparticular instance you think there is not the slightest danger?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of finding in old Sid a modern Launcelot?\" Fenton turned his friend\r\nabout till both of them faced down the length of the room.  \"Well,\" he\r\nadded, \"to be sure----\"\r\n\r\nGrenville's quick glance had sped to the massive mirror, ten feet away,\r\nwhere both himself and Fenton were reflected from heels to crown.  He\r\ncomprehended in a glance the ill-clothed, thin, ungainly figure he\r\npresented: his big hands hanging loosely down, his face too ruggedly\r\nmodeled, too sallow for attractiveness, his hair too rebellious for\r\norder.\r\n\r\nA Launcelot indeed!  The irony of the situation struck home to his\r\nsense of humor.\r\n\r\n\"Have a look,\" continued Fenton, his nervous glance indifferent to his\r\nown athletic fitness, the perfect grooming of his person, the grace and\r\nelegance of his tailoring.  \"Do you discern anything of the disloyal\r\nambassador in that hard-worked friend and comrade of my happiest\r\nyears?\"  His eyes gleamed irresistibly.  \"You see, old chap, you have\r\ntrusted an invention of perhaps incalculable worth to my honor, and\r\nmust leave both your fame and possible fortune in my keeping while you\r\nare long away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but----\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, exactly.  This is the sort of thing you and I have always done\r\nby one another.  I had no thought of refusing your trust in me, and\r\nso--I have booked your passage for Wednesday.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned again to the mantel and began to fill his pipe.\r\n\r\nGrenville pivoted slowly and rubbed the corner of his jaw.\r\n\r\n\"You have--booked my passage--for Wednesday?\"\r\n\r\nFenton nodded.  \"Elaine is quite desolate and lonely.  You need\r\nimmediate sunshine and warmth, and can do no good remaining here.  Fine\r\nday all round for starting, Wednesday, and no boat sailing sooner.\r\nThere are one thousand dollars in that wad by the statue of Anubis, for\r\nyour outfit and incidental cash.\"\r\n\r\nGrenville glanced mechanically at the dog-headed god of the ancient\r\nEgyptians, apparently guarding the money towards which Fenton had waved\r\na careless gesture.\r\n\r\n\"One thou----\"\r\n\r\n\"If it isn't enough, draw on my bankers for more,\" interrupted Fenton,\r\npuffing at his calabash industriously.  \"I have written Elaine so fully\r\nyou'll have nothing to explain.\"\r\n\r\n\"By George!\" said Grenville, more aggressively, \"I like your nerve--the\r\nway you'd plunge me into trouble!  Do you think I'm a mere senseless\r\nrack of wires and bones because I'm not my usual self?  What's to\r\nprevent me from falling head over heels----  What's the rest of her\r\nname--Elaine what?  And you probably have her photograph somewhere\r\namong your possessions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Her full name,\" Fenton answered, moving to the desk beside the mirror,\r\n\"is Elaine Lytton--twenty-one this month.  We've known each other seven\r\nyears.\"  He returned, extending a small-sized photograph.  \"Fine girl.\r\nThat's her picture.  Good likeness--sent me last winter from China.\"\r\n\r\nGrenville studied the photograph superficially.  He used it to tap on\r\nthe table as he once more faced his host.\r\n\r\n\"About as I expected,\" he announced with his customary candor.\r\n\"Nice-looking girl--nothing extra, perhaps, but nice enough.  Now tell\r\nme how any healthy male friend of yours can guarantee not to fall in\r\nlove with Elaine, on a long, lazy trip through the tropics,\" and he\r\ncast the picture from him towards the lamp.\r\n\r\nFenton relighted his pipe.  \"Well, suppose he did commit the folly you\r\ndescribe, what then?\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\" echoed Grenville, incredulously.  \"By the long, curved\r\nlashes of Juno's eyes, if I were the man you'd certainly see what then!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said the imperturbable Fenton.  \"I accept your conditions,\r\nfully, and about your outfit I'd suggest----\"\r\n\r\n\"Hold on!\" interrupted Grenville.  \"I haven't accepted your commission,\r\nmuch as the trip----\"\r\n\r\n\"The trip!\" said Fenton.  \"Ah! that's the point!  I insist on your\r\nmaking the trip, you see, and taking the rest.  Fetching Elaine from\r\nChina is merely incidental--only don't forget her completely and come\r\nback here empty-handed.\"  He sat down to wrestle with his pipe.\r\n\r\nGrenville looked at him amusedly.\r\n\r\n\"Now, see here,\" he said, \"don't you make the slightest mistake, you\r\nconfident old idiot.  If I should just happen to fancy Elaine, I\r\nwouldn't give you twenty cents in Mexican money for your chances at the\r\nwedding bells and trimmings.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you'll go!\" Fenton suddenly exploded, springing to his feet.\r\n\"Come on, that's settled--shake.\"\r\n\r\nBut Grenville retreated from the outstretched hand, a queer smile\r\nplaying on his features.\r\n\r\n\"Hang your infernal self-conceit,\" he answered; \"you don't think I\r\ncould win her if I tried.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe you'll try.\"\r\n\r\n\"That isn't the point.  I might.  If I loved her I would, you can bet\r\nyour final shoe peg!  Your proposition isn't fair--subjecting a man,\r\nand a friend at that, to possible temptation, all kinds of treachery,\r\nand a war between love and duty.  Rot that kind of duty!  I want you to\r\nknow that if I take the trip and happen to fall in this muddle with\r\nyour girl, I'm going to pitch your infernal old duty game overboard in\r\nless than two seconds and go in and win her, if I can!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, what's all the row about, after that?\" inquired Fenton as\r\nbefore.  \"Haven't I said I accept your challenge?  Go out there and\r\nfetch her, that's all.  As for the rest--win her, if you can!\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't say I'll try to win the girl.  I may not like her for a cent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then why all this futile argument and waste of valuable time?\"\r\n\r\n\"But I may--confound your egotistic nerve, and your insistence!  And I\r\nwarn you, Fen, I mean every word, in case----\"\r\n\r\n\"I understand--I understand you fully, without repetition,\" Fenton once\r\nmore interrupted.  \"For Heaven's sake, give me your hand, old man, and\r\ncease firing.\"\r\n\r\n\"You meant it, then--no strings on the proposition?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a string--absolutely not a string.\"\r\n\r\nA strange new thrill of pleasure crept into Grenville's being, warming\r\nhis thin, anæmic pulses suddenly, as he met Fenton's gaze and once more\r\npermitted his thoughts to dwell on all the proposal embraced.  Since\r\nFenton refused to be worried concerning himself and the girl who\r\nsupplied the motive for the trip, then why should he consider it\r\nfurther?  Elaine was, in fact, swiftly fading from his reflections.\r\n\r\nAll his nature yearned towards the tropic seas.  All his overwrought\r\nframe and substance ached for the long, lazy days of indolence, rest,\r\nand recuperation that alone could restore him to himself.  He had\r\nalways longed for precisely this excursion to the far-off edge of the\r\nsphere.  His faculties leaped to the new-made possibility of a contact\r\nwith the ancient world, heretofore so wholly inaccessible.\r\n\r\nAlready new color had come to his face and a new blaze of fire to his\r\neyes.  Privations and toil, those two unsparing allies that had made\r\nsuch inroads on his health and strength, seemed fading harmlessly away.\r\nThe prospect was far too alluring to be resisted.  There was no good\r\nreason in the world for refusing this favor to a friend.\r\n\r\nThe brightness of face that had ever made him so lovable, came\r\nunbidden, there in the glow.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose I'll have to go,\" he presently admitted, \"if it's only to\r\nwin your girl.\"\r\n\r\n\"Shake,\" said Fenton; and they shook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nAN UNEXPECTED OUTBURST\r\n\r\nThe sea is an ancient worker of miracles in amazing transformation, but\r\nrarely does it bring about a more complete or startling metamorphosis\r\nthan that which was wrought upon Grenville--trusted messenger for a\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\nLong before the shores of Cathay loomed welcomely upon his vision he\r\nhad lost all sense of weariness or depression, and likewise all that\r\nworn and gaunt appearance of a large, thin frame inhabited by a dogged\r\nbut thoroughly exhausted spirit.\r\n\r\nHe was once more his strong, bold, interested self, merry of speech,\r\nbright-eyed, untamed in his buoyant nature, lovable, thoughtful of\r\nthose about him, impetuous, and never to be repressed.  He had flirted\r\nuninterruptedly with all the old women and the children on the outward\r\nvoyage, and was now as cheerfully repeating this gay performance on the\r\nsteamship \"Inca,\" homeward bound, on which he was certainly the\r\nfavorite of the crew and his fellow-passengers.\r\n\r\nThe fortnight passed with Elaine upon the sea had been wholly\r\nuneventful, save for the vast commotion astir in Grenville's being.\r\nThe worst that could happen, he told himself, had happened.  His daily\r\ndeportment towards his charge had baffled, piqued, and amused that\r\nyoung lady alternately, and convinced her that here was a brand-new\r\nspecimen of the genus man with which she had never had a genuine\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nShe found him boyish, unexpected, apparently indifferent, and even\r\nunaware, at times, of her existence on the vessel, then fairly\r\neffervescent with deviltry that left her all but gasping.  He was not\r\nto be classified, fixed, or calculated, save in certain traits of\r\nfearlessness, generosity, and kindness to those most needful of a\r\nhelping smile, a merry word, or a spell of relief from daily cares.\r\n\r\nHe commanded a certain admiration from the puzzled girl, but as yet her\r\nactual feelings towards him were quite unanalyzed.  She was constantly\r\nfinding herself astonished at the scope and variety of his information;\r\nshe was glad to listen when he talked; she was frequently touched to\r\nthe very heart by his tender care of one or two frail little beings on\r\nthe ship to whom much of his time was devoted.\r\n\r\nThere they were, with the situation between them apparently commonplace\r\nto dullness--till this one particular day.\r\n\r\nIt was not a common day on the ocean.  Despite the fact he was neither\r\nmariner nor meteorologist, Grenville felt some vast disturbance\r\nimpending in all the lifeless air, regardless of the fact the barometer\r\nwas steady and the calm, rainless spell had been exceptionally\r\nprolonged.  It was not precisely a premonition that addressed itself to\r\nhis senses; it was something he could not explain.\r\n\r\nA wave of heat passed swiftly through his body, leaving a strange\r\nexcitement in its train, as he paused for a second to wonder if the\r\n\"symptoms\" he sensed were concerned not at all with sea or weather, but\r\nwholly with Elaine.\r\n\r\nHe admitted the love--the wild, free, passionate love that had swept\r\nhim away, past all safe anchorage, with her entry into his existence.\r\nHe had made no effort to conceal it from himself, to deny its\r\noverwhelming force.  He had cursed Gerald Fenton most heartily and\r\nconsistently for casting him into this maelstrom of conflicting\r\nemotions, and daily and nightly he had waged mighty war with that\r\nfortunately absent individual, who had calmly accepted his challenge.\r\n\r\nThe trouble had come unbidden.  Elaine was so wholly different from the\r\ngirl represented by Fenton's photograph!  The picture had seemed so\r\nlifeless--and she was so gloriously alive!  That one fact alone seemed\r\nsufficient excuse to Grenville for all that had happened to him since.\r\nHe had not been fully informed, he argued, respecting her wondrous\r\ncharms.\r\n\r\nThe two weeks mentioned, with Elaine at his side, had certainly\r\naccomplished the world-old complication once more, despite all his hard\r\nand honest struggling.  When the fight had ceased he did not even know.\r\nWhat Elaine's private attitude was towards himself he had taken no time\r\nto inquire.  That part mattered less than nothing at all--at least as\r\nconcerned the present.  He had warned old Fenton what to expect, but\r\nnow--by the gods--how deeply he was mired in the quandary!\r\n\r\nHe was certainly mighty hard hit, he confessed, but meantime was\r\nequally positive that the singular something he plainly felt, invading\r\nthe air and telling its message to some faint, imperfect sense of his\r\nbeing, had nothing whatsoever to do with this business of passionate\r\nemotions.  Yet not a sign of uneasiness on the part of officers and\r\ncrew could his keenest wit discover, in any quarter of the iron craft\r\nplowing steadily on across the sea.\r\n\r\nHe had climbed to the topmost deck of the ship, where he and a\r\ncarpenter, who was hewing out a boat thwart with a gleaming adze, were\r\ntemporarily alone.  It was not Grenville's manner of wooing to hover\r\nbeside Elaine throughout the day or evening.  He had done no wooing, as\r\na matter of fact, beyond assuming a somewhat bold but unoffending\r\nguardianship, which she might have found refreshing had it not so\r\nfrequently taken her breath with its very matter-of-factness.\r\n\r\nAt the present moment, as Grenville was well aware, she was somewhere\r\ndown on the shaded portion of the promenade, where the erstwhile stir\r\nof tropic air had ebbed to utter sluggishness and finally expired.  One\r\nof the purser's young assistants, dressed in wrinkled white duck, was\r\ndumbly adoring at her side.\r\n\r\nImpatiently banishing Fenton from his thoughts, Grenville gazed idly at\r\nthe sultry sky, and as idly at the carpenter, wielding the polished\r\nadze.  When a deckhand presently called this workman away, Grenville\r\ntook up the implement left behind, felt he would like to swing it just\r\nonce at the root of the complication now arisen between himself and his\r\ndistant friend--on whose money he was voyaging--and whose sweetheart\r\nhis nature demanded for a mate--and, replacing the tool on the\r\nweathered planks, he thrust both hands in his pockets and paced to and\r\nfro, beside a pair of inverted lifeboats and a raft, that occupied most\r\nof the deck.\r\n\r\nHe finally flung himself down on a hatch, in the shade of a\r\nwhite-painted funnel, and plunged his warring faculties into\r\nconcentrated study of a problem in mechanics involved in a new\r\ninvention.  On the back of a letter, drawn from an inside pocket, he\r\ndrew black hieroglyphics, that to him were wheels and levers that\r\nrelieved his state of mind.\r\n\r\nAbsorption claimed him for its own.  The swift, weird changes of the\r\nsky and atmosphere escaped his engrossed attention.  He was not even\r\naware of her presence till Elaine had been standing for fully five\r\nminutes, a few feet only from his side.\r\n\r\nWhen he looked up at last and beheld once more that singular glow and\r\nbeauty in the depths of her luminous eyes, and felt the subtle flattery\r\ninvolved in the fact she had come to the place to find him, seek him\r\nout, a flood of tidal passion surged to his outermost veins.\r\n\r\nIt was just the one straw too much, this unforeseen encounter, with the\r\nsmile upon her lips.  His sturdy resolutions all went down in utter\r\nconfusion before the wild gladness of his heart.  Yet he made no\r\noutward sign for Elaine to read.\r\n\r\nCalmly, to all appearances, he placed the letter in his pocket.\r\n\r\n\"I hope,\" said Elaine, \"I haven't disrupted anything important.\"\r\n\r\nHe arose and gazed at her oddly.\r\n\r\n\"You have, Elaine,\" he answered, in a voice he strove hard to control.\r\n\"You've not only disrupted everything heretofore moving along its\r\naccustomed path of order, law, and calm, but you've also upset all\r\nsorts of established institutions and raised some merry Hades.\"\r\n\r\nA spirit of the lively old Nick was infusing with his youthful blood as\r\nhe stood there gazing upon her.  Elaine, however, either failed to\r\ndetect its presence, or she failed to understand.\r\n\r\n\"I?\" she said, \"Mr. Grenville.  I'm sorry.  What have I done?\"\r\n\r\nHe could not have done the conventional thing, the deliberate, calm, or\r\nexpected thing, to save his immortal soul.  His nature was far too\r\nhonest, too unabashed.  He came a step nearer--and then she knew, but\r\nshe could not have moved at the moment had death been the oncoming\r\npenalty for remaining where she stood.  She had never been so startled\r\nin her life.\r\n\r\nThey two were absolutely alone and unobserved.  Of this the impulsive\r\nGrenville was aware--and the knowledge had fired a certain madness in\r\nhis being he was powerless to quell.\r\n\r\n\"Elaine,\" he said, as he suddenly caught her unresisting hands, \"you've\r\nput old Fenton entirely out of the game.  You're going to marry me.\"\r\n\r\nShe was dimly conscious of pain in her hands, where he crushed them in\r\nhis ardor.  But her shocked surprise was uppermost, as she faced him\r\nwith blazing eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Grenville!\" she said.  \"Mr. Grenville--you----  To say--to\r\nspeak----\"\r\n\r\n\"Elaine,\" he interrupted gayly, bright devils dancing in his boyish\r\neyes, \"it simply couldn't be helped.  We were intended to meet--and\r\nwere cut out for one another.  So the hour must come when you'll pitch\r\nold Gerald's ring in the sea by order of the very Fates themselves!\"\r\n\r\nShe snatched away her hands in indignation.\r\n\r\n\"For shame!\" she cried in rising anger, her whole womanly being aflame\r\nwith resistance to all his growing madness.  \"You haven't the slightest\r\nright in the world----\"\r\n\r\n\"Right?\" he repeated.  \"Right?  I love you, Elaine!  I love you!\r\nHaven't I said----\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the treachery--the treachery to Gerald!\" she cut in, with swiftly\r\nincreasing emotion.  \"To say such things when your honor----\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" he interrupted, eagerly.  \"I told him what he might expect from\r\nany such arrangement.  I warned him precisely what might happen.  He\r\nunderstood--accepted my conditions--made it a challenge--declared if I\r\ntried I couldn't win!  And now----\"\r\n\r\n\"You can't--you can't!--you can't!\" she cried at him, angrily.  \"To\r\nthink that Gerald--to think you'd dare----\"\r\n\r\nHe suddenly caught her in his arms and crushed her against his breast.\r\nHe kissed her on the mouth, despite her struggles.\r\n\r\n\"Elaine,\" he said, \"you are mine--all mine--my sweetheart--my\r\ncomrade--my mate!\"\r\n\r\nShe finally planted her fists against his throat and thrust him from\r\nher in fury.\r\n\r\n\"You brute!\" she answered, sobbing in her anger.  \"I hate you--I loathe\r\nyou--despise you utterly!  I wish I might never see your face again!\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll make you love me, Elaine,\" he answered, white at last with\r\nintensity and deep-going passion.  \"I'll make you love me, as I love\r\nyou--as madly--as wholly--as wondrously--before ever we two get home.\"\r\n\r\nAlready Elaine was retreating from the place.\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" she answered, wildly.  \"Never, never, never!--do you\r\nhear?--not if it takes this boat a hundred years!\"  And gropingly,\r\nalmost blinded by her sense of shame and rage, she fled from the deck\r\nand down the stairs, leaving him shaken where he stood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nA MIDNIGHT TRAGEDY\r\n\r\nNot the slightest alarm had invaded the ship, when Grenville finally\r\nurged his senses back to the normal, notwithstanding the unaccustomed\r\nsuddenness with which the aspect of the day had been reversed.\r\n\r\nThe storm broke at last, about one in the afternoon, with a deluge of\r\nrain and an onslaught of wind that seemed for a time refreshing.  The\r\nhuge steel leviathan appeared to elevate her nose, give her shoulders a\r\nshake that settled her firmly in the gray disorder of the elements, and\r\nthen to accept the rude old contest with a certain indifference, born\r\nof well-established prowess.\r\n\r\nBy two o'clock there was nothing refreshing suggested.  A dull,\r\nstubborn struggle was waging in the drab of a wild and narrow field of\r\ncommotion.  Chill, musty billows of air, made thick by something that\r\nwas neither scud nor mist, pounced heavily upon the laboring \"Inca\" in\r\na manner chaotic and irregular.  The sea was rising sullenly, its\r\nwaves, like tumultuous cohorts, with ragged white banners, ceaselessly\r\nadvancing.\r\n\r\nWith an easy, monotonous assurance the great device of steam and iron\r\nplugged steadily onward.  It could ride out a sea of tremendously\r\ngreater violence.  It knew from long experience every crest and every\r\nabyss of these mountains of air and water.  It met huge impacts\r\nmajestically, with a prow that cleaved them through, while its huge,\r\nwet bulk plowed up its mileage with a barely diminished speed.\r\n\r\nFew of the passengers were actually alarmed.  A storm evolved so\r\nsuddenly, they were confidently informed, would expend itself in one\r\nbrief spasm of impotent fury and subside almost as it had come.  It was\r\nall some mere local disturbance that the spell of dry, calm weather had\r\naccumulated too swiftly for any save a violent discharge.\r\n\r\nDiscomfort increased to a certain pitch; locomotion about the saloon\r\nbecame impracticable.  The crew alone remained upon their legs.  It\r\nseemed like the climax to the storm.  But another stage swiftly\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nIt might have been somewhat after three P.M. when a shroud of darkness\r\nsettled from the heavens, its substance foreign both to cloud and sea.\r\nIt was thicker than before, and decidedly more musty.  As black as\r\nnight, but unrelated to all ordinary essences of darkness, it wrapped\r\nthe stormy universe in Stygian folds with a suddenness strangely\r\ndisquieting.\r\n\r\nThe cataclysm followed almost instantly, as if from behind a concealing\r\ncurtain.  It came in dimensions incredible, a prodigious wall of\r\nrumpled water, like a mobile mountain chain.  It towered forbiddingly\r\nabove the quivering vessel for one terrible moment of threat, then\r\nconfusion, utter and seemingly eternal, plunged roaringly over and\r\nunder the helpless ocean toy of steel, submerging the very sea itself\r\nin Niagaras of sound and weight and motion.\r\n\r\nA hideous shudder quivered through the feeble plaything of the\r\nelements.  Strange, muffled thunderings, sensations of oblivion\r\nsweeping miles deep across the ocean, and a horrible conviction of the\r\nship's insignificance, impressed themselves pellmell upon the senses,\r\nwhile ebon blackness closed instantly down, like annihilation's swift\r\naccompaniment, and the hull seemed sinking countless fathoms.\r\n\r\nSuch a moment expands to an æon.  Doom seemed an old acquaintance when\r\na complex gyration, a sense of being flung through space, and a\r\nreassertion of the engine's throb preceded the struggle to the surface.\r\nYet it seemed as if no miracle of buoyancy and might could survive till\r\nthe great steel body rose once more to the air.  Men held their breath\r\nas if they must drown if the top were not immediately achieved.\r\n\r\nA stupendous lurch, an incredible list to starboard, another streaming\r\nby of immeasurable torrents, and the steamer wallowed pantingly out\r\ninto daylight once again, to flounder like a thing exhausted till she\r\nsteadied once more to the roll and pitch of the former storm-driven sea.\r\n\r\nThere had been no time for any man to act till the monstrous thing had\r\ncome and gone its way.  As helplessly as all the others, Grenville had\r\nclutched at the table, there beside Elaine, while death passed and\r\nroared in their faces.  He had gone to her chiefly for appearances, yet\r\nquite as if nothing had happened, despite their scene above, while\r\nElaine had issued from her stateroom in terror of the storm.  It was\r\nnot till new, sharp sounds of activity broke on his senses, from above,\r\nthat Sid left her side and went to inquire concerning the sum of their\r\ndamage.\r\n\r\nHis face had lost a shade only of its usual cheerfulness, when he\r\nfinally returned.  The ship was rolling heavily, fairly in the trough.\r\n\r\n\"Our rudder is gone, with six of the lifeboats and as many men,\" he\r\ntold his charge, whose courage he had previously gauged.  \"The worst is\r\nundoubtedly over.  We can steer with the screws, sufficiently to make\r\nthe nearest port.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our rudder!--half a dozen men,\" Elaine faintly echoed, her brown eyes\r\nablaze with dread and sympathy, as she steadied from the shock of\r\nGrenville's news.  \"What was it?  How did it happen?\"\r\n\r\n\"A tidal wave.  There must have been a huge volcanic disturbance,\r\ndoubtless under the sea.  Or it may have been an earthquake,\r\ntremendously violent.  Nothing else, according to the Captain, could\r\naccount for a storm so sudden, or for all this strange thickness of the\r\nair.  He is confident now of our safety.  The storm may subside in an\r\nhour.\"\r\n\r\nThere was not the slightest cessation of the storm, however, till eight\r\no'clock in the evening.  Even then the night continued thick and wild.\r\n\r\nFortunately the sea was vast and deep.  There was nothing known in two\r\nhundred miles on which the ship could blunder.  Hour after hour the\r\ncrippled \"Inca\" limped erratically onward, buffeted helplessly here and\r\nthere, and scalloping angry abysses of darkness and water, as first one\r\nscrew and then the other was driven full speed, or slowed to half, or\r\nreversed altogether, to hold her nose to the altered course that would\r\nfinally fetch them to a port for highly essential repairs.\r\n\r\nThe rage of the elements, abating at last a trifle, had far exceeded\r\nthe Captain's expectations.  And when at length the center was passed,\r\nand comparative ease had supervened, the wind was still a considerable\r\ngale, while the sea would run high till nearly morning.\r\n\r\nThe passengers, however, were sufficiently assured to retire at a\r\nfairly early hour.  Elaine had readily responded to Grenville's\r\nmatter-of-fact instructions, and, long before midnight, was fitfully\r\nsleeping, although she had not undressed.\r\n\r\nWhen eight bells struck from the bridge somewhere above him, Grenville\r\nstill sat on the edge of his berth, rumpling his hair with one vigorous\r\nhand, while the other prisoned a book on his knee with a piece of white\r\npaper upon it.  The paper was literally covered with mechanical designs\r\nand hieroglyphics, involved in his latest problem.\r\n\r\nHe arose at last, removed his coat, and began to fumble with his tie.\r\nHis eyes were fixed upon his paper.  The problem's spell was cast again\r\nupon him.  He sank, as before, to his inconvenient seat, and drew yet\r\nanother design.\r\n\r\nHow long he remained there, tranced by the lines that represented\r\nlevers, gears, and eccentrics, the man could never have stated.  He was\r\ndimly subconscious it was time to go to bed, and from time to time one\r\nhand would return to his collar.  As a matter of fact, the hour was\r\npast one of the morning.\r\n\r\nThen, of a sudden, apparently beneath his very feet, the frightful\r\n_thing_ occurred.\r\n\r\nIt came all together--the grinding crunch, the colossal upheaval of the\r\nship's great belly full of vitals, the scream of iron ripped from iron,\r\nthe roar of steam from broken pipes, and the tremor of death-throes,\r\nshuddering thus promptly down to the canted bow and stern from the\r\nwedge-shaped split amidships.\r\n\r\nThey had struck on a rock, upheaved by the earthquake, where a hundred\r\nfathoms of crystal brine had existed the previous noon!\r\n\r\nThe hideous conviction of doom and horror sped as swiftly as the shiver\r\nof destruction to the farthest confines of the vessel.  Screams far and\r\nnear, hoarse bellowing, a shrill, high pæan of mortal fright, and\r\nsounds of disordered scurrying followed with a promptness fairly\r\nappalling.\r\n\r\nGrenville waited for nothing.  As well as the most experienced officer\r\non board, he realized the significance of the impact, the ship's awful\r\nbuckling, and the quiver stilling the creature's heart--the engines\r\nthat had ceased at once to throb.\r\n\r\nHis door had been flung widely open.  Before he could reach the turning\r\nof the corridor, the one electric bulb, left glowing for the night,\r\nabruptly blackened.  But he knew the way to Elaine.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to be plunging through a torture hall, so hurtling full was\r\nthe darkness of fearful cries and confusion.  The broken hulk of the\r\nsteamer slightly lurched, as the plates broke yet farther apart.\r\nSidney was flung against a cabin wall, but he righted and pitched more\r\nrapidly down the already canted passage.\r\n\r\n\"Elaine!\" he called.  \"Elaine!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes!\" she answered.  \"Yes!  I can't get out!\"  She was not at all in a\r\npanic.\r\n\r\nSomeone, a man, rushed headlong by and nearly bowled Grenville over.\r\nHe was spilling golf clubs from a bag and calling for the steward.\r\n\r\nGrenville caught at the knob of Elaine's hard-fastened door and threw\r\nhis weight upon it.  A stubborn resistance met his effort.  The frame\r\nhad been distorted by the splitting of plates and ribs.  The wedging\r\nwas complete.\r\n\r\n\"Stand back!\" he called out sharply.  \"I must break it in at once!\"\r\n\r\nHe knew they were late already--that swarms of beings, nearer the\r\nexits, were wildly pouring from the ship's interior, to be first to the\r\nboats, so fatally reduced in numbers.\r\n\r\nWith all his might he hurled his shoulder against the door, that merely\r\ncreaked at his impotent assault.  The hall was narrow.  He could gain\r\nno momentum for his blow.  The second and third attack made no\r\nimpression.\r\n\r\nA clammy sweat exuded from his forehead.  That the sea was tumbling\r\ntorrentially into the helpless vessel he knew by countless indications.\r\nElaine must perish helplessly in her trap, could he not immediately\r\nforce the barrier.  He suddenly got down, full length, upon the floor,\r\nbraced his shoulders against the opposite cabin, and, with knees\r\nslightly raised, placed both his feet against the door.  Then he\r\nstrained with superhuman strength.  The door remained immovable, but\r\nits paneling slightly cracked.\r\n\r\nMeantime the shrieks, the shouts, the roaring of steam, and the\r\nterrible chaos of destruction had increased to a horrifying chorus.\r\nThe corridor was filling with hot, moist vapor from the burst pipes.  A\r\ndozen stokers had perished.  Fire had attacked a portion of the vessel\r\nabaft the midships section.\r\n\r\nOnce more, with a wild, fanatic conjuring of energy, Grenville spent\r\nhimself upon the door--and a panel snapped out, flinging little\r\nsplinters on Elaine.  In a fury of desperate activity the man on the\r\nfloor beat out more with his driving feet.\r\n\r\n\"It's large enough!  It's large enough!\" cried the girl as the orifice\r\nwidened.  \"Don't wait to break it larger!\"\r\n\r\nShe was now fully dressed, having swiftly prepared for any sort of\r\nemergency.  A candle, provided from her bag, was glowing in her hand.\r\n\r\nThis she thrust forth for Grenville to take, and then, with deliberate\r\ncare, she wormed her way out through the jagged hole with the confident\r\nskill of a child.\r\n\r\n\"Not there!\" called Grenville, as she hastened ahead to gain the\r\nforward companionway.  \"Everybody's there, all fighting for their\r\nlives!\"\r\n\r\nHe caught her actively about the waist, as a further lurch and settling\r\nof the \"Inca\" would have hurled her to the floor.  Down through a\r\nshorter passage and up a strangely tilted stair he drew her rapidly,\r\nhis heart assailed by a sickening fear of what their delay might have\r\ncost them.  Yet less than five minutes had actually passed since the\r\nfirst vast shock of disaster.\r\n\r\nThey emerged to a portion of the slanted deck that seemed to be utterly\r\ndeserted.  A gust of wind blew out the candle.  The sky was clear.  An\r\nuneven fragment of the aging moon shone dully on the broken ship,\r\nwhence fearful sounds continued to arise.\r\n\r\nOnly one of the boats had been dropped to the tide--to be instantly\r\nwhirled _inside_ the parting steamer, on the torrent filling her mighty\r\nbelly, where the latest lurch had laid her widely open.\r\n\r\nGrenville ran to the starboard rail for a glance towards the struggle\r\nfarther forward.  There, about the impotent crew, laboring hotly with\r\npeople, boats and davits no longer adjusted to normal working order,\r\nthe wildest confusion existed.\r\n\r\nA boat that hung out above the sea was filled with screaming beings.\r\nSome madman arose and slashed with maniacal fury at the rope of the\r\nblocks, to hasten the craft's descent.  Of a sudden its bow shot\r\nperpendicularly downward, its stern still high in the air.  Its cargo\r\ndropped out like leaden weights, while the empty shell, like a\r\npendulum, swayed to and fro above the smothered cries.\r\n\r\nTo join such a throng would be but to choose a larger company in which\r\nto perish.  Grenville saw that the steamer must presently drop from her\r\nrock and sound illimitable depths.  This could hardly be delayed for\r\nmore than ten minutes longer.\r\n\r\nA sickening qualm assailed his vitals at the thought of Elaine, doomed\r\nto drown thus helplessly, along with himself and the others.  He knew\r\nthat not only were the boats insufficient, but there was no time left\r\nto load and launch them!\r\n\r\nThen, at length, he remembered the life-raft on the roof.  Once more,\r\nwith his arm supporting Elaine, he clambered up a tilted stairway.  The\r\nplace was deserted.  The raft was there--but securely fastened to the\r\nplanking, fore and aft and at the sides!  The ropes that bound it down\r\nwere thick and doubled!\r\n\r\nWith his knife the man attacked them desperately.  The blade broke out\r\nof the handle when one strand only had been severed.  His second blade\r\nwas small and useless for such a labor.\r\n\r\nHe groaned, for a ghastly tremor was seizing the \"Inca\" as she hung\r\nabove some crumbling abyss for a final plunge to the bottom.  Then the\r\nmoonlight gleamed on the carpenter's adze, which had slid down the deck\r\nto the railing.  He darted upon it like an animal, and, hastening back,\r\nswung it with swift and savage blows that severed the ropes like cheese.\r\n\r\n\"Quick!  Quick!\" he shouted to Elaine, as he flung the implement from\r\nhim; and, catching her roughly about the waist, he bore her face\r\ndownward beside himself, full length upon the raft.\r\n\r\nIt was already slightly in motion, where the ship was toppling to her\r\ngrave!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE NIGHT--AND MORNING\r\n\r\nWith a rattle and scraping along the deck, the device with the two\r\nprone figures desperately clinging to its surface, was halted and\r\ntilted nearly level as it struck a spar and partially mounted upon it.\r\n\r\nA sudden glare lit up the scene where the fire had burst through\r\nshattered windows.  Screams yet more appalling than those already\r\npiercing the gale arose with the movement of the vessel.  A picture\r\ngrotesque and monstrous was for one awful moment presented.  The huge\r\niron entrails of the vessel heaved up into sight with her breaking.\r\nHer funnels, masts, and superstructure pointed outward, strangely\r\nhorizontal.  Innumerable loose things rattled down the decks.  She\r\nbelched forth flame and clouds of steam, against which one huge iron\r\nrib, rudely torn on its end to the semblance of a giant finger, seemed\r\npointing the way to inscrutable eternity.\r\n\r\nThe lantern, up at the \"Inca's\" masthead, describing an arc as it swept\r\nacross the heavens, was the last thing Grenville noted.  He thought how\r\ninsignificantly it would sizzle in the sea!  Then he and Elaine, with\r\nraft and all, were flung far out, by the suddenly accelerated velocity\r\nof the doomed leviathan, turning keel upwards as it sank.  When they\r\nstruck, their puny float dived under like a crockery platter, shied\r\nfrom some Titanic hand.\r\n\r\nWith all his strength the man clung fast to Elaine and the lattice-like\r\nplanking of their deck.  It seemed to Grenville, still submerged, he\r\ncould never resist the force of the waves to wash them backwards to\r\ndeath.  It appeared, moreover, the raft would never return to the top.\r\nA million bubbles broke about his ears.  He felt they were diving to\r\ndeeps illimitable.\r\n\r\nWith a rush of waters drumming on their senses, it shot precipitately\r\nupward at last, till air and spray greeted them together.  Then, sucked\r\ndeep under, anew, and backward, by the gurgling vortex where the ship\r\nhad gone, and swirling about, pivoting wildly, as the raft now\r\nthreatened to plunge edge downward to the nethermost caverns of the\r\nhungry sea, they met a counter-violence that forced it once more\r\ntowards the surface.\r\n\r\nThe boilers had burst in the steamer's hold, with confusion to all\r\nthose tides of suction.  Erratically diving here and there, a helpless\r\nprey to chaotic cross currents in all directions, the float swung\r\ngiddily in the mid abyss, while the water walls baffled one another.\r\n\r\nElaine, even more than Grenville, was bursting with explosive breath\r\nwhen, at length, the raft came twisting once more to the chill, sweet\r\nregion of the gale.  And even then strong currents drew it fiercely in\r\ntheir wake before it rode freely on the waters.\r\n\r\nDripping and gasping, Grenville half rose to scan the troubled billows\r\nfor companions in distress.  Not a sound could he hear, save the swash\r\nof the waves.  Not a light appeared in all that void, save the distant,\r\nindifferent stars.\r\n\r\nElaine, too, stirred, and raised herself up to a posture half sitting.\r\nShe was hatless.  Her hair was streaming down across her face and\r\nshoulders in strands too wet for the wind to ravel.  Her eyes were\r\nblazing wildly.\r\n\r\n\"The ship?\" she said.  \"What happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sunk.\"  He stood up.  Their platform was steadying buoyantly as it\r\ndrifted in the breeze.  \"I can't even see the spot,\" he added,\r\npresently.  \"We couldn't propel this raft to the place, no matter who\r\nmight be floating.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's terrible!\" she whispered, faintly, as one afraid to accuse the\r\nFates aloud.  \"Couldn't we even----  You think they are all--all gone?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll shout,\" said Grenville, merely to humor the pity in her breast.\r\nHis long, loud \"Halloo\" rolled weirdly out across the wolf-like pack of\r\nwaves, three--four--a half dozen times.\r\n\r\nThere was not the feeblest murmur of response.  Yet he felt that,\r\nperhaps, one boatload at least might have sped away in safety.\r\n\r\n\"God help them!\" he said, when the silence became once more\r\ninsupportable.  \"He only knows where any of us are!\"\r\n\r\n\"After all we'd been through!\" she shivered in awe.  \"If only we two\r\nwere really saved----  Oh, there must be land, somewhere about, if the\r\nCaptain was trying to reach a port!  But, of course, this isn't even a\r\nboat, and, perhaps, it will finally sink!\"\r\n\r\nHe tried to summon an accent of hope to his voice.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, no; it will float indefinitely.  It's sure to turn up somewhere in\r\nthe end.\"\r\n\r\n\"We haven't food--or even water,\" she answered him, understandingly.\r\n\"What shall we do to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are drifting rapidly northward.  We may arrive somewhere by\r\nto-morrow....  You'd better sit down.  It taxes your strength to stand.\"\r\n\r\n\"God help us all!\" she suddenly prayed in a broken voice, and, sinking\r\nlower where she sat, was shaken by one convulsion of sobbing, in pity\r\nfor all she had seen.  She had no thoughts left for their earlier,\r\npersonal encounter.\r\n\r\nFor a time Grenville stood there, braced to take the motion of the\r\nraft.  The wind continued brisk and undiminished.  Aided by tides,\r\nwhich had turned an hour earlier, to flow in its general direction, it\r\ndrove the raft steadily onward over miles of gray, unresting sea.\r\n\r\nThe water slopped up between the slats whereon Elaine was sitting.  She\r\nwas cold, despite the tropic latitude.  She was hopeful, only because\r\nshe wished to contribute no unnecessary worry to the man.\r\n\r\nGrenville at length sat down at her side, but they made no effort to\r\nconverse.  Elaine was exhausted by the sickening strain and the shock\r\nof that tragic end.  For an hour or more she sat there limply, being\r\nconstantly wet by the waves.  She attempted, finally, to curl herself\r\ndown and make a pillow of her arm, and there she sank into something\r\nakin to sleep.\r\n\r\nGently Grenville thrust out his foot and lifted her head upon the\r\ncushion of flesh above his ankle.  The night wore slowly on.  Three\r\no'clock came grayly over the world-edge, where the waves made a\r\nscalloped horizon.\r\n\r\nSlowly the watery universe expanded, as the dawn-light palely\r\nincreased.  By four Grenville's gaze could search all the round of the\r\nocean, but nothing broke either sky or sea.\r\n\r\nFive o'clock developed merely color on the water, but no sign of a sail\r\nor a funnel.  Elaine still slept, while Grenville, cramped almost\r\nbeyond endurance, refused to move, and thereby disturb her slumber.\r\n\r\nBut at six, as he turned for the fiftieth time to scan the limited\r\nhorizon, he started so unwittingly, at sight of a tree and headland,\r\nflatly erected, like a bit of sawed-out stage scenery, above the waste\r\nof billows, that Elaine sat up at once.\r\n\r\n\"It's land!\" he said.  \"We're drifting to some sort of land!\"\r\n\r\nShe was still too hazy in her mind, and puzzled by their surroundings,\r\nto grasp the situation promptly.\r\n\r\n\"Land?\" she repeated.  \"Oh!\" and a rush of hideous memories swept\r\nconfusedly upon her till she shivered, gazing at the water.\r\n\r\nGrenville had risen to his feet, and Elaine now rose beside him.\r\nSomewhat more of the flat, wide protrusion from the sea became thus\r\nvisible to both.  It still appeared of insignificant extent, a blue and\r\nfeatureless patch against the sky, with one half-stripped tree upon its\r\nsummit.\r\n\r\n\"I should say it's an island,\" Grenville added, quietly, restraining an\r\nexultation that might prove premature.  \"It is still some miles away.\"\r\n\r\n\"There must be someone there,\" Elaine replied, with an eagerness that\r\nbetrayed her anxious state of mind.  \"Almost anyone would certainly\r\nhelp us a little.\"\r\n\r\nWhat doubts he entertained of some of the island inhabitants in this\r\nparticular section of the world, Sidney chose to keep to himself.\r\n\r\n\"It's land!\" he said, as he had before.  \"That means everything!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know of any island that ought to be in this locality?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't the remotest notion where we are--except we are somewhere,\r\nbroadly speaking, in the neighborhood of the Malay peninsula.  The\r\nsteamer must have drifted tremendously out of her course after we lost\r\nour rudder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you been awake for long?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't slept.\"\r\n\r\n\"Have you seen or heard anything of any of the others?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not a sign....  We may find some of them, landed on this island.\"\r\n\r\nHe had no such hope, and this she felt.  She summoned a heart full of\r\ncourage to meet the situation, however, and gazed off afar at the misty\r\nterra incognita enlarging imperceptibly as they drifted deliberately\r\nonward.\r\n\r\n\"It's fortunate,\" she said, \"the steamers pass this way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, unwilling to shake this solitary hope that brightened\r\nher uncertain prospect, but he knew they were leagues from the nearest\r\ntrack that the ocean steamers plowed.  \"And I trust we'll find it\r\nentirely comfortable while we're waiting,\" he added.  \"We're sure to\r\nget dry and find something fit to eat.\"\r\n\r\nShe was silent for a moment.  A sense of constraint was returning at\r\nlast for their scene of the previous day.  \"It seems to be rather far\r\naway,\" was all she said.\r\n\r\n\"About another hour--if the breeze and tide continue favorable.\"\r\n\r\nIt was nearer an hour and a half, however, before they were finally\r\nabreast the headland with the tree, and swinging and turning slowly by\r\nthe island's coast on the surface of a complicated tide.\r\n\r\nThe features of the land had developed practically everything usual to\r\nthis latitude except habitations of men.  That it was entirely\r\nsurrounded by water was convincingly established.  Indeed, it was not\r\nan extensive outcrop of some ocean-buried range, and, despite the\r\nluxuriance of its various patches of greenery and jungle, it was\r\ndecidedly rugged in formation.\r\n\r\nThe edge past which the raft was leisurely floating was a broken and\r\ncavern-pitted wall of rock affording no promise of a landing.  Above\r\nthis loomed the solitary tree that Grenville had seen from a distance.\r\nNothing suggestive of hearth smoke arose against the sky from one end\r\nof the place to the other.\r\n\r\nThis one vital fact, in her excitement, Elaine entirely overlooked.\r\nShe likewise failed to note the look of concern that Grenville could\r\nnot have banished from his eyes.  The prospect of reaching a dry, firm\r\nsoil outweighed her immediate worries.\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't we paddle in closer?\" she said.  \"Where do you mean to land?\"\r\n\r\n\"Where the Fates shall please,\" he answered, grimly.  \"Without even a\r\nline for me to take ashore we must not be over fastidious.\"\r\n\r\n\"We could swim--if we have to,\" she told him, bravely.  \"We seem to be\r\nfloating farther out.\"\r\n\r\nThey were, at that particular moment.  The powerful current carried\r\nthem swiftly seaward a considerable distance, till at length the raft\r\nwas drawn to a species of whirlpool, some two hundred yards in\r\ndiameter, the inner rim of which was depositing weed at the edge of\r\nsomething like an estuary, indenting the shore of the island.\r\n\r\nOn the huge circumference of this whirlpool they were finally rounding\r\ntowards the one bit of beach that Grenville had been able to discover.\r\nYet when they approached within almost touching distance of this sunlit\r\nstrand, the current failed, permitting the breeze to waft them again\r\ntowards the center.\r\n\r\n\"Stand by to go ashore,\" said Grenville, resolving suddenly on his\r\ncourse, and overboard he slipped, at the float's outer edge, and, using\r\nhis legs like a powerful frog, he pushed at the raft with sufficient\r\nforce to overcome the action of the wind.\r\n\r\nFor a moment his efforts seemed in vain--and then the clumsy affair\r\nnosed reluctantly shoreward an inch, and was once more assisted by the\r\ntide.  Ten feet out he found the water shallow and, planting his feet\r\non the solid sand, drove the raft at once to the estuary's edge, where\r\nElaine leaped lightly ashore.\r\n\r\nSome startled creature slipped abruptly into the pool that the tiny\r\nharbor formed.  This escaped Elaine's attention.  A moment later the\r\nraft rode scrapingly over a bar that all but locked the inlet, and\r\nGrenville stood dripping on the sand.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome to our city,\" said he, an irrepressible emotion of joyousness\r\nand relief possessing him completely at the moment, and, going at once\r\nto the near-by growth, where a long stout limb had been broken from a\r\ntree, he dragged this severed member forth to the beach and across the\r\nestuary's mouth, where it effectually blocked the channel against the\r\nraft's escape.  Then he folded a couple of large-sized leaves with his\r\nhands, secured each with a slender twig, and, giving one to Elaine for\r\na cap, placed the other upon his head.\r\n\r\nElaine was no less relieved than he, so elastic and buoyant is youth.\r\n\r\n\"The villages must be on the farther side,\" she said.  \"What language\r\ndo you suppose the natives speak?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--doubtless some Simian, in any case,\" he answered, having fancied\r\none movement half seen in the trees beyond was made by an ape or a\r\nmonkey.  \"I'd suggest you recall your fondness for fruit for breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nShe comprehended his meaning with amazing promptness.  Her face took on\r\nits serious expression.\r\n\r\n\"You don't believe we shall find the island inhabited?  We shall have\r\nonly fruit this morning?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure we shall find some fruit,\" he said, \"and we must certainly\r\nlook for water.\"\r\n\r\nA sense of helplessness and despair attacked Elaine momentarily.  She\r\nbegan to wonder, with alarm, how long they might be stranded on the\r\nplace--and what attitude Grenville might assume.  She had thoroughly\r\ncomprehended the passion of his nature in the outburst she had seen.  A\r\nsense of distrust she dared not show came creeping to her mind.\r\n\r\n\"We must make the best of it, of course,\" she said, as calmly as\r\npossible.  \"We can't even light a fire, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"I certainly have no matches,\" he answered, cheerfully.  \"All I had\r\nwere in my coat.  Suppose we explore the island first and leave despair\r\ntill after breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nShe met his gaze with fearless eyes that set his heart to pounding.\r\n\r\n\"I shall never despair,\" she answered, more bravely than she felt,--\"at\r\nleast, I shall try to do my part, till we are taken off.\"\r\n\r\nHe understood the challenge in her attitude.\r\n\r\n\"I felt that from the first,\" he answered, easily.  \"Perhaps we'd\r\nbetter begin by climbing up to the headland.\"\r\n\r\nHe caught up a short, heavy stick and turned about to force a way up\r\nthrough the rocks and tangled growth between the shore and summit.\r\n\r\nAnd what a figure he presented--even to the frightened girl, whose\r\nanger still lingered in her veins--stripped, as he was, to his\r\nshirtsleeves, a powerful, active being, masterful and unafraid.  With a\r\nstrange, dreadful sense of isolation and the primitive, aye, even\r\nprimal, conditions in which they had been cast, she followed helplessly\r\nat his heels for their first real look at the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE ISLAND\r\n\r\nThe ascent was steep and difficult, so unbroken was the undergrowth,\r\nexcept where jagged and pitted rocks rose grayly on the slope.\r\nBananas, nut palms, and mangoes Grenville promptly noted.  Indeed,\r\nevery tropical tree, shrub, and fruit of which he had ever learned was\r\nrepresented in the thicket, together with long, snake-like creepers,\r\nhuge ferns, and many plants with which he had no acquaintance.\r\n\r\nThere was abundant life in all directions.  Here, with a grunt, and\r\nbeyond with a bound of startled surprise, some animal scuttled to cover\r\nin alarm at their approach.  A small flock of parrots abruptly arose,\r\nflashing their brilliant plumage in the sunlight and screaming\r\nraucously.  Half a dozen leeches, clinging firmly to the fat, green\r\nleaves next the ground, where all was moist and shaded, attracted\r\nGrenville's notice as they lifted their heads and groped about for\r\nflesh upon which to fasten.\r\n\r\nHere and there in the tree tops a monkey obscured a patch of sky for a\r\nmoment and chattered or squeaked a warning to his kind.  Grenville,\r\nalmost wholly convinced that man seldom or never visited the place, and\r\npuzzled to account for a fact so extraordinary, now emerged at the edge\r\nof a natural clearing and promptly discovered a small patch of sugar\r\ncane, reared above the grass and vines.  He was certain that man had\r\nbrought it to the island.\r\n\r\nA half minute later he underwent a decidedly complex set of emotions.\r\nHe was barely five feet ahead of Elaine, who was following blindly in\r\nhis trail, a prey to new dreads of all the sounds about them, when he\r\nhalted in a tense and rigid attitude of alertness.  Elaine glanced\r\nquickly ahead.\r\n\r\nApparently a patch of orange sunlight was lifting from the grass.  Then\r\nElaine, too, saw the black, irregular stripes, the huge, topaz eyes,\r\nand the lazy movement of a mighty shoulder muscle, as the beast before\r\nthem arose and blocked their path.\r\n\r\nIt was not the fact that he had rarely if ever seen a tiger so large\r\nthat most impressed the man, thus unexpectedly confronted by this\r\nunfrightened monarch of the island--_the brute bore a collar about his\r\nneck, gleaming with gold and the facets of some sort of jewels_!\r\n\r\nHe had obviously once been a captive!  He knew the form of man, if not\r\nhis nature!\r\n\r\nFor a moment or more there was absolute stillness in that grassy arena,\r\nwhere two world-old enemies stood face to face in their first,\r\npreliminary contest of courage.  A certain arrogance, a contempt of all\r\npossible adversaries, here in his undisputed realm, shone unmistakably\r\nin the eyes of the motionless brute.  His paunch was rounded\r\nsignificantly.  He had recently dined.\r\n\r\nGrenville could think of but one thing to do, unarmed as he was, and\r\nunwilling to compromise an encounter so vitally important.\r\n\r\nHe let out a shout such as a demon might have uttered, and, rushing\r\nmadly forward, with his club upraised, yelled again and again, his\r\naspect one to strike terror to the heart of a giant.  He was almost\r\nupon the astonished tiger when the brute abruptly fled.  The roar the\r\ngreat beast delivered, as he bounded from sight in the jungle, was the\r\nsullen note of a creature that obeys, reluctantly, the command of one\r\nsuperior to himself.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, a little discretionary haste,\" said Grenville, quickly\r\nreturning to Elaine.  \"I prefer the top of the rocks.\"\r\n\r\nBut she did not move, so helpless was her will and so rigid all her\r\nbeing.  Once more, with his arm about her waist, Sidney firmly urged\r\nher forward, on a beaten trail he took no time to study.\r\n\r\nIt led in a tortuous manner up the last steep acclivity, where, with\r\nevery rod, the growth became less luxuriant, and the rocks more thickly\r\nstrewn.  Thus they presently came upon a second natural clearing, a\r\nsort of uneven terrace, some fifty feet lower than the dominating\r\nheadland crowned by the solitary tree.\r\n\r\nThe trail to this final eminence was plainly scored along a narrow,\r\ncrumbling ledge, where the volcanic tufa, comprising the ancient\r\nupheaval, had for years disintegrated in a honeycomb fashion that left\r\nall the bowlders and even the walls deeply pitted.\r\n\r\nWhen they turned about together on this dominating mount, the island\r\nlay mapped irregularly beneath them in the purple sea, revealed\r\nwell-nigh in its entirety.\r\n\r\nIn all its expanse there was not a sign of a human habitation.\r\n\r\nThey knew, without a word of argument, they were absolutely alone on\r\nthis tropic crumb of empire, sole survivors of the frightful wreck,\r\ncompletely ignorant of their whereabouts, and surrounded not only by\r\nsavage and inimical jungle brutes, but also by some mystery that was\r\nnot to be understood.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Grenville, presently, \"such as it is, it's ours.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ours,\" said Elaine.  A cold little shiver ran along her nerves, at\r\nthoughts of her plight between the man she had called a brute, and the\r\nstill more savage creatures of the jungle.  \"Where are you going?\" she\r\nadded, as Grenville moved away.\r\n\r\n\"To look about for a moment,\" he replied, \"and then I must pick some\r\nbreakfast.\"\r\n\r\nThe examination of the hilltop was promptly concluded.  It proved to be\r\na flat, uneven plateau of small dimensions, with precipitous walls on\r\nevery side, except where the trail led downward.  Much loose rock was\r\nscattered on its surface.  Three-quarters of its boundary rose\r\nperpendicularly out of the sea.  The remainder plunged down into jungle\r\ngreenery, and the natural clearing that lay between two dense, rank\r\ngrowths on either side.  Not far from the center of the table-rock a\r\nfair-sized cave, that bore unmistakable signs of former occupancy and\r\nfires once ignited on its floor, afforded a highly acceptable shelter,\r\nboth from the sun and the elements.  It occupied, of course, a position\r\nthat could be readily and easily defended.\r\n\r\nThere were other, smaller caverns close at hand, but none with a whole\r\nor unpierced roof.  Fragments of broken clay utensils lay scattered\r\nabout, together with the whitening bones of small-sized animals that\r\nhad one time served some denizens for food.  There was nothing in or\r\nabout the principal cave of which Grenville could make the slightest\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThe view of the island from this point of vantage was not particularly\r\nencouraging.  Midway of its rugged bulk, that jutted from the azure\r\ntides, and on the side directly opposite the estuary, another wall of\r\nrock loomed, gray and barren, above the tops of the trees.  Behind\r\nthis, at the island's farthest, left-hand extremity, a third\r\n\"intrusion\" of volcanic stuff rose to a height only barely lower than\r\nthis whereon the raftmates stood.  It was not, however, flat.\r\n\r\nA portion only of the estuary was visible--the outer bay, where the\r\nraft was plainly floating.  Save for areas covered with rock and brush\r\ntogether, the remaining surface of the island appeared to be thickly\r\ngrown to jungle, the forest comprising foliage of infinite variety.\r\n\r\nWith Elaine walking silently at his side, afraid to be with him, yet\r\nmore afraid to be alone, Grenville passed from this hasty examination\r\nof the island's general topography to a closer inspection of the\r\nperpendicular scarp of the terrace.  On the seaward side it rose about\r\none hundred feet above the mark of high water.  Its right front\r\nappeared to overhang its base, a reassuring distance above the highest\r\ntree.  Across its entire bulk at this place the cliff had once been\r\ncracked, and a \"slip\" had formed a ragged shelf.  Then came the slope\r\nwhere the trail was worn, beyond which forty feet or more of unscalable\r\ntufa was reared above a section of the jungle once devastated by fire.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this section, being rapidly reclaimed by vines and\r\ncreepers, stood the shell of a huge old tree, the heart of which had\r\nbeen consumed, from the roots to its blackened top, leaving walls still\r\nthick and solid.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Sidney, returning again to the principal cave, which he\r\nreinspected critically, \"it doesn't take long to overlook our\r\npossessions.  You'd better begin to make yourself at home, while I go\r\nbelow for fodder,\" and, taking up his club from a ledge where he had\r\nlet it fall, he went at once down the long-abandoned trail and out\r\nacross the clearing.\r\n\r\nElaine had followed to the scarp, where she watched till he\r\ndisappeared.  How helpless she was in the hands of this man, whose\r\ndeclaration and deeds had so aroused her indignation and hatred, she\r\nthoroughly understood.  A sickening conviction that days might elapse\r\nbefore she could hope to escape, increased her sense, not only of\r\nalarm, but also of distrust in Grenville.  His action in taking up his\r\nstick had not escaped her attention.  Strangely enough, a horrible pang\r\nwent straight to her breast as she suddenly thought of that tiger\r\nagain--and of what it might mean if Grenville never returned.  Whatever\r\nelse might happen, nothing could be so terrible as to perish here\r\nalone.  She tried to assure herself, however, that Grenville was\r\nthoroughly competent to cope with the dangers of the place.\r\n\r\nYet the silence of the jungle where she had seen him disappear,\r\noppressed her unendurably.  Not even a tree was shaken, to indicate\r\nwhere he had gone.  Summoning all her resolution, she returned to the\r\ncavern, alone.\r\n\r\nA slab of rock, once doubtless employed for a table, lay with one end\r\nresting on the earth, while the other leaned upon a second rock,\r\nagainst the wall of the cave.  She lifted this slab to a second prop,\r\nthen blew the last fragment of dust and sand from its surface, by way\r\nof preparing it for breakfast.  She looked about, longing for further\r\nemployment, but, inasmuch as two rude fragments of the rock already\r\nreposed beside her table for seats, there was absolutely nothing more\r\nshe could add, either by way of utensils or furnishings, from the\r\nboulders scattered loosely on the terrace.\r\n\r\nWhen she thought of leaves, whereon to serve what fruits the jungle\r\nmight surrender, she started briskly for the trail--but halted at its\r\nsummit.  A horror of unknown things that might be lurking at the\r\nthicket's edge impressed itself upon her.  Nevertheless, she shook it\r\noff, and, descending rapidly, soon filled her arms with large, clean\r\n\"platters\" from a rankly growing plant of the \"elephant's ear\" variety,\r\nthen clambered back to her aerie.\r\n\r\nTwo of the leaves she dropped at the bend of the trail and left them\r\nthere in the sun.  Twice after that she returned to the edge, to search\r\nall the greenery for Grenville.  Her uneasiness respecting his long\r\nabsence was rapidly increasing when she turned once more toward the\r\ncave.  He emerged at that moment from the farther thicket of the\r\nclearing, came unobserved to the winding trail, and discovered the\r\nleaves she had abandoned.\r\n\r\nHe was amazingly \"loaded\" with similar leaves for breakfast purposes,\r\nas well as with fruits, and a singular bowl of water, yet he paused,\r\nwith a smile upon his lips, to discard every leaf he had provided, in\r\norder that Elaine's thoughtful effort at assistance might not be in the\r\nleast belittled.\r\n\r\nShe met him just as he came to the top, and began to take a portion of\r\nhis burden.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" she said, \"you've found water--or is it the juice of the melon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Water,\" he answered, moving towards the cave.  \"The bowl is half of a\r\npaw-paw, which, next to that spring itself, is the welcomest thing I've\r\ndiscovered.\"\r\n\r\nShe was glad to note bananas among his several fruits, but she made no\r\nfurther observations.  More and more her sense of constraint increased,\r\nas she clearly foresaw her dependence upon and intimate association\r\nwith this man, who had overstepped the bounds of honor to his friend,\r\nand to whom she had spoken in such anger.\r\n\r\nBreakfast was soon begun.  Elaine consumed all she could relish of the\r\nfruits, although neither the loco (loquet, a yellowish sort of plum),\r\nthe guava--green and full of seeds--nor the custard apple, which was\r\nsomewhat sickishly sweet, appealed irresistibly to her fancy.\r\n\r\nShe drank from a leaf, curled up to form a cup, and found the water\r\ndecidedly refreshing and agreeable, despite the fact it was slightly\r\nflavored by the juices of the paw-paw shell in which it had been served.\r\n\r\nGrenville leaned back, when his appetite was thoroughly appeased, and\r\nbegan to empty his pockets.  He produced the remains of his broken\r\nknife, a few loose coins, a ring of keys, a pig-skin purse with several\r\npieces of gold as its contents, the stub of a pencil, and his watch,\r\nwhich, by great good fortune, was waterproof, and still in good running\r\ncondition, despite its several immersions.\r\n\r\nElaine was watching his movements, puzzled to guess his intent.\r\n\r\n\"Taking stock,\" he said, presently, \"by way of facing the situation and\r\nformulating plans....  These trifling chattels are all I possess in the\r\nworld--our world, at least--with which to begin certain labors.  You\r\nprobably haven't even hairpins.\"\r\n\r\nElaine had coiled her hair upon a twig.  She shook her head, and\r\nfaintly resented his allusion to the island as a sort of partnership\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nGrenville began to segregate his belongings.\r\n\r\n\"Money, keys, pencil, and watch--all mere encumbrances, absolutely\r\nworthless.  One broken knife--invaluable.  We shall require, as soon as\r\npossible, water-jugs, basins, cooking utensils, something to make a\r\nfire, implements to chop our fuel, some primitive weapons, and tools\r\nwith which to fashion a boat.  I must lose no time in exploring beyond\r\nthe spring.  I have found nothing yet that will especially lend itself\r\nto our uses.\"\r\n\r\nElaine's brown eyes were very wide.  \"You expect to remain here long\r\nenough to build a boat, when the raft----  I know it can't be rowed, of\r\ncourse, but--couldn't you try a sail?\"\r\n\r\n\"We couldn't sail it in its present form,\" he answered, \"even if we\r\nknew which direction to take when we started.  With a small, swift boat\r\nwe might venture a few explorations from the island as a base.\"\r\n\r\nShe was silent for a moment, and grave.\r\n\r\n\"You haven't much faith, then, in hailing some passing steamer?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it wiser to prepare against a probable wait that may be rather\r\nlong.\"  He read and understood her impatience with the situation--a\r\nsituation rendered infinitely more complicated and delicate by what he\r\nhad dared to say and do the previous afternoon.\r\n\r\nOnce more black dreads that she dared not permit to reveal themselves\r\ncompletely arose to engulf her mind.  She could not doubt that\r\nGrenville knew, far better than herself, how meager were their hopes of\r\nimmediate rescue or escape from this exile in the sea.  More than\r\nanything else, however, she wished to be worthy of and loyal to the man\r\nto whom her plighted word had been given.  That she owed so much to\r\nGrenville already was an added irritation.  A braver, finer spirit than\r\nshe summoned to her needs never rose in a woman's breast.\r\n\r\nHer eyes met his with a cold look of resolution in their depths.\r\n\r\n\"I know you will show me how to help.  I must do my share in\r\neverything.  Can you tell how long it must have been since anyone was\r\nhere?\"\r\n\r\nGrenville had never thought her finer--never loved her so madly before.\r\nYet he quelled the merry demons of his nature.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he replied, as he took in his hand a bit of bone, bleached\r\ncleanly white.  \"I can't even understand why an island so abundantly\r\nsupplied with fruits and game, to say nothing of useful woods and the\r\nlike, should be so utterly abandoned.  There seems to be nothing wrong\r\nwith the place, and much that is quite in its favor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps that tiger,\" she suggested.\r\n\r\nSidney shook his head.  \"It's something that goes a bit deeper--at\r\nleast, there may once have been something sinister.  The natives of all\r\nthis part of the world are rather accustomed to tigers.\"\r\n\r\nHer sense of divination was exceedingly keen.\r\n\r\n\"You think there is something worse?  You haven't already encountered\r\nsomething more----\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" he hastened to interrupt.  \"The problem of our daily\r\nexistence affords our greatest present cause for concern--and I frankly\r\nadmit I considerably relish the prospect of proving we are equal to all\r\nthat our situation may demand.\"\r\n\r\nShe was not to be satisfied so readily.\r\n\r\n\"But there may be something wrong with the island?\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly--from a native's point of view.\"\r\n\r\n\"But--you are almost certain to meet that tiger again.\"\r\n\r\n\"All the more reason for getting to work at once.\"  He arose in his\r\nquick, active manner, and once more surveyed their camp.\r\n\r\n\"A few rocks piled in your doorway,\" he continued, \"and your cave will\r\nmeet your requirements admirably.  I should say mine would better be\r\nthis small retreat, the roof of which I can readily restore.  It is\r\nclose enough to be neighborly, and is nearer the head of the trail.\"\r\n\r\nThe smaller cave thus indicated occupied a position suggestive of a\r\nsentry's box, before precincts to be guarded.  Its opening faced the\r\ngateway of the trail, while its size was sufficient for the needs of\r\nany primitive man.\r\n\r\nElaine, who had mechanically followed Grenville from the shelter,\r\nlooked resignedly about.  She had failed till now to think, concretely,\r\nof actually remaining, perhaps night after night, in such a place.\r\n\r\n\"It was terrible!\" she said, \"--the accident--everything!--terrible!\"\r\nShe suddenly thought of the threat he had made--to compel her to love\r\nhim as he loved her, before they should reach their home--and shivered\r\nanew at the unforeseen predicament in which she was plunged, and hated\r\nhim more than before.\r\n\r\n\"Bad business,\" he answered, briefly, \"but at present the task before\r\nus is to cut a lot of grass and strew it about on the rocks to dry.\"\r\n\r\nHe opened the stubby blade of his knife, glanced at it ruefully, and,\r\nselecting a bit of stone, began to whet its edge.  But he halted the\r\naction abruptly.\r\n\r\nA low, weird sound, like a human wail, came from somewhere over behind\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nVARIOUS DISCOVERIES\r\n\r\nThe sound had no sooner died on the air than a second, far louder, and\r\nfar more uncanny in its suggestiveness of someone in mortal pain,\r\nfollowed piercingly, up around the rock, and rang in their startled\r\nears.\r\n\r\nThe third sound more resembled a scream.  It was immediately succeeded\r\nby a chorus of hideous cries and moans, singularly distressing.  They\r\nrose to a pitch incredible; they seemed to involve every accent of\r\nhuman grief and torture, and to wrap the rock escarpment completely in\r\nan agonizing appeal.\r\n\r\nThis chorus sank, but a haunting solo of wailing arose as before, to be\r\nfollowed again by the air-splitting scream, and at length once more by\r\nthe mingling of many dreadful voices.\r\n\r\nThe island exiles glanced at one another inquiringly, Elaine blanched\r\nwhite with awe.\r\n\r\n\"By Heavens!--it can't be human,\" Grenville muttered, as the programme\r\nrecommenced with only a slight variation.\r\n\r\nTo Elaine's dismay he started for the cliff.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Grenville!\" she cried, and helplessly followed where he went.\r\n\r\nThe wail was dying, in a horrid series of feebler repetitions, when\r\nGrenville came to the edge of the wall and peered down below at the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThere was absolutely nothing to be seen in any direction.  The direful\r\nsounds, fast progressing once more to that nerve-destroying climax,\r\nappeared to issue from a natural cove, a little along to the left.\r\n\r\nGrenville continued around the edge, to a point directly above them.\r\nBut here, as before, there was nothing in all the sea suggestive of\r\nboats or beings.  The tide, Grenville thought, ran in and out with\r\nparticular force, reversing at a certain point, and performing singular\r\nmovements in a basin of hollowed stone.\r\n\r\nElaine had paused behind him, a rod or more from the brink.  He waited\r\ndeliberately for all the cycle of sounds to be repeated, then turned\r\naway with a smile.\r\n\r\n\"I think we have come upon the explanation of the island's uninhabited\r\ncondition,\" he informed the girl, as he came once more to her side.\r\n\"Those noises are made by the sea, forcing air to some cavern in the\r\ncliffs.  It is doubtless repeated twice a day at a certain stage of the\r\ntide.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's horrible!\" Elaine replied in dread, as a feebler rehearsal of the\r\nchorus filled all that tropic breeze, \"simply horrible!\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be our greatest bit of good fortune,\" Grenville informed her,\r\nsagely.  \"I much prefer those sirens to a colony of Dyaks who might\r\notherwise live on the place.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to endure it twice a day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Possibly not.  I may be entirely mistaken, concerning that.  I can\r\nonly be certain it is caused by the tide, and is, therefore, not to be\r\ndreaded.\"\r\n\r\nFor fully ten minutes, however, the tidal conditions were favorable to\r\nthe sound's continuance.  It subsided by degrees, the last moaning\r\nnotes possibly more suggestive than the first of beings perishing\r\nmiserably.\r\n\r\nMeantime Grenville had gone indifferently about the business of cutting\r\nhuge armfuls of the tall grass and ferns abundantly supplied in the\r\nclearing.  This moist and not unfragrant material Elaine in silent\r\nhelpfulness carried to the top of the terrace, where she spread it\r\nabout on the rocks.  She was certain Grenville was providing far more\r\nthan they could use in reason, yet although his stubby knife-blade was\r\na poor tool, indeed, for the business, he toiled away unsparingly,\r\nblithesomely whistling at his task.\r\n\r\n\"You may be glad by nightfall to burrow into a stack of this hay,\" he\r\ntold Elaine as he brought the last load up the trail.  \"If you wouldn't\r\nmind turning it over from time to time I think I'll look about again to\r\nget an idea of the island.\"\r\n\r\nElaine had as little inclination to remain on the terrace alone, with\r\nall manner of worries respecting Grenville's safety, as she had to\r\nfollow where he would lead through the shades and thickets of the\r\njungle.  She was aware, however, her presence at his side would be more\r\nof a care than assistance; while the necessity for his explorations\r\naddressed itself clearly to her mind.  She made no confession of her\r\nnatural wish to see him returning promptly.\r\n\r\nHe departed, with his club in hand, quite certain he should not be gone\r\nabove an hour.  He had not, however, reckoned with the jungle.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact he had set his mind on the region about and beyond the\r\nspring, the flow of which formed the estuary, some wonder respecting\r\nthe area once blackened and cleared by fire attracted his attention\r\nimmediately upon his descent from the hill.\r\n\r\nThrough a fringe of scrub he forced his way to this region close under\r\nthe walls, discovering old, charred stumps, many dead saplings, and\r\nquantities of half-consumed branches, affording a large supply of fuel.\r\nThere could be no doubt the fire had raged within the previous year.\r\nHuman visitors of some complexion had come, left this scar, and\r\ndeparted.\r\n\r\nHopeful of some enlightening sign as to who or what they might have\r\nbeen, he searched the earth about and between the shrubs and grasses\r\nwith considerable care.  Not so much as a bone, however, rewarded his\r\nscrutinizing gaze.  He came to the tree trunk left hollow by the\r\nflames, and paused to marvel at its size.  Above his head it was four\r\nfeet through, while the base was certainly eight.  An arch had been\r\nformed in its substance, near the ground, and into this he curiously\r\npeered.\r\n\r\nKneeling thus on the earth, he was readily enabled to look straight up\r\nthrough and out at the top.  The hollow in the stout old jungle\r\nchampion was fully two feet in diameter, and almost perfectly round.\r\nThere was nothing else of interest to be found about the place, save a\r\nhuge, smooth log, lying with one end resting on a rock, and long enough\r\nto make a splendid boat.\r\n\r\nAttempting the passage of the jungle from this point across to the\r\nmidway wall of tufa, Grenville expended fully fifteen minutes of the\r\ntoughest sort of effort, and was then obliged to retreat once more to\r\nthe trail.  He encountered here the first wild animal discovered since\r\nhis meeting with the tiger.\r\n\r\nIt was a porcupine, bristling with trouble for any attacking beast.\r\nGrenville could have slain it with his club.  He was fairly on the\r\npoint of providing this much meat for the sadly empty larder, when the\r\nfact that he could ignite no fire deterred his ready weapon.  He\r\nthought, in that extremity, of his watch, the crystal of which might\r\nserve to give him a white-hot spark from the sun.\r\n\r\nTrusting the porcupine might await the result of his quick experiment,\r\nhe lost no time in submitting the glass to a trial.  It formed a ring\r\nof brilliant light on the back of his hand, but the rays would not come\r\nto a focus.\r\n\r\n\"Go thy ways,\" he said to the porcupine, and he continued at once on\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nObserving the trail more closely than he had on his earlier excursion,\r\nhe presently discovered a divergence to the left that led towards the\r\ncentral wall of stone.  Here he frightened a considerable troop of\r\nmonkeys that swung in a panic of activity through the avenues of\r\nfoliage overhead.  There were likewise sounds of heavier beasts that\r\nescaped observation on the moist and thickly cumbered earth.\r\n\r\nThe trail under foot was rather well worn, and not, the man was\r\ncertain, by the hoofs or feet of brutes.  The explanation was presently\r\nforthcoming, at least in part, for the path emerged at a clay pit that\r\nlay against the frowning tower of stone.\r\n\r\nGrenville could have shouted for joy as he took a bit of the smooth,\r\nsticky substance in his hand, and began thus promptly, in his fancy,\r\nmaking pots and jugs innumerable to meet their every need.  The deposit\r\nhad been previously worked.  The evidence of this was unmistakable.\r\nBut none of the tools employed by former craftsmen had been left for\r\nGrenville to discover.\r\n\r\nHe spent some time investigating all the mute signs of former activity\r\nexpended at the pit, and finally glancing up at the cliff above,\r\nabandoned all thought of conquering its summit, and retraced his steps\r\nalong the trail.\r\n\r\nWhere the path to the spring made a second fork, he continued straight\r\non through the jungle.  One glance only of the estuary, tortuously\r\npenetrating the waist of the island, was vouchsafed him through the\r\nthicket.  Beyond this point, in swampy ground, flourished a forest of\r\ngiant bamboo.  The creepers and vines in that immediate section were\r\nparticularly varied and abundant.  The bird life was equally\r\nimpressive.  Hundreds of swallows were skimming in the air, a number of\r\nargus pheasants wildly fled from the visitor's presence, parrots\r\nscreamed and wheeled in huge flocks above the light green bamboo\r\nfoliage, and several fine flamingoes made shift to find concealment in\r\nthe reeds.\r\n\r\n\"It's a haunted paradise,\" Grenville muttered to himself, his thought\r\nhaving gone for a moment to the wails and moans that had startled\r\nhimself and Elaine.\r\n\r\nRegretting that his broken knife was a wholly inadequate implement with\r\nwhich to assail such a bamboo stem as he would gladly have taken to the\r\ncamp, he was once more making his way from the thicket when his foot\r\ncrashed audibly through something brittle, on the earth.\r\n\r\nHe parted the shrubbery and uttered a low exclamation.  He had stepped\r\nupon a human skeleton, white and suggestively huddled, every fragment\r\nof it perfect--except that it lacked a head.\r\n\r\nIn a certain sort of anxiety Grenville searched about to find the\r\nmissing member.  The skull was not to be discovered.  Persuading\r\nhimself this might be accounted for by many natural explanations, and\r\nresolving to keep his discovery entirely to himself, he forced his way\r\naround this grewsome inhabitant--and came upon another.\r\n\r\nThis one he did not strike with either foot.  It lay outstretched\r\nbefore him, in company with scattered and broken bits of rock--and,\r\nlike its neighbor, it was headless.\r\n\r\nHad some monstrous head-hunter written \"Dyaks\" on all the empty lattice\r\nof those human ribs, Grenville could not have been more convinced of\r\nwhat this business meant.  He returned to the trail accompanied by a\r\nsense of dread that all but sent him back to Elaine.  His thought was\r\nentirely of her, and of their helplessness, cast thus alone upon this\r\nunpeopled island, clean stripped of weapons and of all things else save\r\ntheir wits and bodily strength.\r\n\r\n\"We've got to escape,\" he told himself in a new, swift fever of\r\nimpatience.  \"There is not an hour to lose!\"\r\n\r\nHe continued on through the jungle towards the hill at the farther end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nA GREWSOME GUARDIAN\r\n\r\nApparently the trail, that had once been formed through the axis of the\r\nisland, had been found of little use.  It was overgrown by all manner\r\nof plants well-nigh to extinction.\r\n\r\nThe region hereabout was obviously the final retreat of many beasts,\r\nboth timid and bold.  Grenville found signs of at least one Malay bear\r\nand of many wild hogs in the thickets.  He fancied he saw one flash of\r\nmoving orange, where either his tiger or another of his ilk moved\r\nsilently through the growth behind him.  Of the monkeys there appeared\r\nto be no end; and the snakes were amply represented.\r\n\r\nHe was glad for every clearing that he came upon and crossed, and felt\r\na decided sense of relief on achieving his hill at last.  This worn old\r\neminence of rock and substances volcanic was far more steep and rugged\r\nthan the one where he had left Elaine.  It possessed no caves, and no\r\nparticular flatness at the summit.\r\n\r\nGrenville explored it rapidly, considerably disappointed to find\r\nnothing of special utility upon its broken surface.  He had hoped for\r\nsome hard and useful stone at least, if not for actual flints.\r\nCompleting its round in a haste that the rapidly increasing heat of the\r\nday considerably accelerated, he presently came upon an unusual ledge\r\nprotruding from the slope's unpromising surface.\r\n\r\nHere he halted in idle curiosity.  The ledge was of sulphur--a blow-out\r\nfrom the hill's once molten interior, lying untouched and useless in\r\nthe sun for the elements to wear away and sluice at last to the sea.\r\nWith no particular purpose in view, he broke away a fragment, dropped\r\nit carelessly into his pocket, and continued on his way.\r\n\r\nHis gaze returned with a certain steadfast eagerness to the hill and\r\ncamp beyond.  He was not precisely disappointed on failing to discover\r\nElaine, who might have been waiting to wave him a signal from the\r\nheights; he was somewhat concerned to know if all was well upon her\r\nrock.  She was not to be seen at all about the place.  He clambered to\r\nthe top of a broken bowlder for a view more comprehensive.\r\n\r\nThis, too, appeared a wasted effort, at least as concerned Elaine.  The\r\nisland map, however, was laid out before him in a manner to complete\r\nhis former survey of the place.  There were several clearings thus\r\nrevealed that could never be seen from the farther point of vantage.\r\n\r\nAcknowledging each of these in turn, Grenville was once more about to\r\ndirect his footsteps homeward when one of the smaller, near-by breaks\r\nin the jungle, quite at the top of a species of rift in the island's\r\nruggedness, down upon his left, attracted a second glance.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he fancied some colossal remains, as of an animal long\r\nsince extinct, were lying there in the clinging embrace of the\r\ncreepers.  He decided, then, it was a boat, but dismissed this notion\r\nas preposterous, so high above the water's edge, and so near the\r\nisland's center, did it lie.  About ready to conclude that certain\r\ngiant shadows contributed much to round out a half-imagined form, his\r\ngaze encountered a bowsprit thrust through all the foliage, its\r\nidentity not to be mistaken.  The hull of a ship was undoubtedly there.\r\nHe hastened down, expectantly, to make its better acquaintance.\r\n\r\nThe wonder when he came there was--how it came to be stranded so high\r\nand far above the water.  As for the vessel itself, it was merely a\r\nrotted old shell, with its cargo bursting through its ribs.\r\n\r\nSo far as Grenville could judge from its fast-decaying remains, it had\r\nbeen an inferior type of the old-fashioned barque, and of very modest\r\ndimensions.  Its masts, however, were gone, together with every\r\naccessible piece of metal that eager hands could remove.  Its moldy and\r\nslimy old cabin had partially collapsed.  Without effecting an entrance\r\nthrough the treacherous deck, Sidney could discover nothing respecting\r\nits interior.\r\n\r\nHe could peer through the ribs at several places along the hull, and\r\neven near the keel, by stooping low, but the most he could determine by\r\nsuch a superficial examination was that there was nothing even here\r\nthat he could use.  The cargo he thought for a moment to be chalk, or\r\nlime.  He scraped a clean sample from the weathered heap, and rubbed it\r\nin his palm.  Its crystalline structure was not that of either lime or\r\nchalk.  When he placed a particle on his tongue, he dropped all he held\r\nwith no further interest.\r\n\r\nThe stuff was common saltpeter.  That the vessel had been westward\r\nbound, perhaps from Borneo, with this mineral common to so much of that\r\ntropical section, he understood at once.  But to find her stranded thus\r\nso loftily was amazing.  He scraped at the soil with the toe of his\r\nboot to dig below the surface.\r\n\r\nAs he had rather expected, seashells and pebbles of a former beach were\r\nreadily brought to view.  Some old upheaval had undoubtedly lifted\r\nbeach, vessel, and all to this altitude above the tides, and left it\r\nthere to decay.\r\n\r\nConsiderably disappointed to find the hulk so completely stripped of\r\nthe metal furnishings of which he might have wrought some sort of tools\r\nor weapons, Grenville hesitated between an impulse to continue home to\r\nElaine without greater delay, and a strong desire to investigate the\r\ncabin of the barque.  The latter temptation was not to be resisted.\r\n\r\nHe grasped the branch of an overhanging tree and, by dint of much\r\nactive scrambling, clawing, and thrusting his toes into various chinks,\r\nat length gained the planks of the slanted deck and broke his way into\r\nthe one-time sanctum of the captain and his mates.\r\n\r\nThis, too, had been pillaged with exceptional thoroughness.  There was,\r\nhowever, a passageway leading to another apartment beyond, where a\r\ndoor, half open, was revealed by sunlight streaming through the broken\r\nroof.  Thither Grenville made his way--to behold an extraordinary sight.\r\n\r\nThe place was a room, partitioned off from considerably larger\r\nquarters.  It contained one object only--a form, half mummy, half\r\nskeleton, that had once been a powerful man.  _And this was chained to\r\nthe wall!_\r\n\r\nIt was sitting propped against the lintel of a second door, a panel of\r\nwhich was raggedly broken out.  It had never been robbed of its head.\r\nA strong, black beard still remained upon the emaciated face, and the\r\neye-sockets stared straight forward at the door by which the visitor\r\nhad entered.\r\n\r\nGrenville was not to be easily dismayed, yet the attitude of this\r\ngrewsome thing was very far from being pleasant.  The being had been\r\nalmost naked when he perished here alone with a heavy iron band about\r\nhis waist.  All this his visitor swiftly discerned while inclined to\r\nturn about and flee the place.  He discovered, then, an additional\r\nmystery.\r\n\r\nThe skin, in a patch fully six inches square, had disappeared from the\r\nhelpless being's breast.  That it had not wasted away by a natural\r\nprocess was, moreover, perfectly obvious, since the square-cut edges of\r\nparchment, which the remainder of his cuticle had become by the\r\nmummifying process, were distinctly to be seen.  It had been removed\r\nwith a knife.  It appeared to Grenville that the captive had been\r\npropped artificially where he sat, as if to guard the passage.  A\r\ntrickle of water, saturated with saltpeter, had served to embalm both\r\nhis flesh and skin, in part.\r\n\r\nThat the cabin beyond had likewise been despoiled of its treasure was\r\nalmost a foregone conclusion.  However, Sidney stepped closer to the\r\nsilent form and peered through the broken panel.\r\n\r\nThe room into which he was gazing was dimly lighted by the rays of\r\ndaylight filtering through a number of cracks which the weather had\r\nopened in its ceiling.  When his sight grew accustomed to the darkness,\r\nhe saw that the place had evidently served not only as quarters for the\r\nformer crew, but likewise as a storage hold for ropes, paints, extra\r\nfurnishings, and, doubtless, victuals.\r\n\r\nIts contents lay scattered about in confusion and decay, yet promised\r\nmore \"treasure\" for Grenville's needs than all the rest of the vessel.\r\nHe drove his shoulder against the door, and its lock broke the rotted\r\nwoodwork away with a suddenness the man had not expected.  He passed\r\nthe mummified guardian at the portal somewhat hurriedly, as he lurched\r\ninside the chamber; and he nearly fell across a box that had spilled\r\nout a dozen old pieces of brass.\r\n\r\nUpon these he pounced with avidity, despite the fact they were greenly\r\nincrusted with \"rust.\"  Among other articles of plunder thus provided\r\nto his hand were several row-locks, a broken turnbuckle, a dozen at\r\nleast of useless hinges, and a hatful of screws more or less cemented\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nWith vague ideas of employing the metal somehow, he filled his pockets\r\nwith the smaller articles and looked about for possible tools.  From a\r\nbroken locker in a corner much similar scrap stuff had fallen.  Here\r\nwas a large brass porthole rim, parts of a broken binnacle, half of the\r\nbrazen cap from a towing-bit, two heavy bronze handles of swords now\r\nfallen to pieces with decay, an old brass lantern with a useless lamp,\r\na large coil of excellent copper wire, a ball of lead, and remains of\r\nseveral iron marlinespikes, mere effigies now in flaky rust.\r\n\r\nFrom beneath a heap of rotted cordage a greenish cylinder protruded.\r\nGrenville drew it forth.  It proved to be a small brass cannon,\r\nunmounted, and apparently filled with mud.  Near by he discovered the\r\nrapidly disintegrating remnants of an old-time flintlock musket.  This\r\nwas a priceless treasure, for the flint, which was still intact.  He\r\nlikewise saved a bit of the steel that the cordage had protected.\r\n\r\nThe thin and wasted skeleton of a hand-saw hung upon a hook.  When he\r\ntook the blade between his fingers it fell apart like paper, charred,\r\nbut still holding its original form.  Not an object he found of iron\r\nwas worth removing to the camp.  Resolved to return at an early date,\r\nto annex the old cannon and such other heavy bric-à-brac as he could\r\nnot conveniently carry away to-day, Grenville finally left the\r\nmysterious dead man still sitting in chains beside the door, and once\r\nmore regained the wholesome earth.\r\n\r\nHe finally glanced at his watch.  The time was nearly twelve!  He had\r\nbeen for at least three hours away from Elaine, who was waiting alone\r\nupon the hill!  Back to the trail, and then along its sinuous windings\r\nthrough the jungle, he strode at his swiftest pace.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the final clearing before the towering rock, he was all\r\nbut paralyzed with dread at a bit of drama being there enacted.\r\n\r\nAt the edge of the jungle stood Elaine, her arms and jacket filled with\r\nfruits she had gathered against his coming.  By the foot of the trail\r\nthat ascended to their camp, posed in a waiting attitude, his long tail\r\nonly in motion, gracefully sweeping his great tawny side, was the tiger\r\nthat wore the golden collar.\r\n\r\nNot a sound escaped from Elaine's white lips, as she turned to glance\r\nacross at Sidney.  Then she limberly sank on the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nPRIMITIVE CONDITIONS\r\n\r\nA short, sharp cry was the only note that Grenville uttered.\r\n\r\nThe tiger had turned his blazing eyes on the man he but partially\r\nfeared.  Sidney was coming less at him than towards the helpless,\r\nprostrate form that lay upon the grass.\r\n\r\nThe man had forgotten his danger in his greater concern for Elaine.  He\r\nreached her side before he confronted the jungle beast, who still\r\nremained undecided.  Slowly then, deliberately, the malignant animal,\r\nsuperb not only in his strength and splendid proportions, but also in\r\nhis arrogance, his indifference to man, the master butcher of the\r\nworld, ran out his tongue to lick his chops, stretched his terrible\r\nmouth in a fang-revealing yawn, and trod his way into the thicket.\r\n\r\nThe fruits she had gathered were scattered all about as Grenville\r\nlifted Elaine in his arms and carried her up the steep ascent.  Not\r\nhaving actually swooned, she had fairly begun to revive once more\r\nbefore he reached the cave.\r\n\r\nWhen he placed her down on a heap of half-dried grass she had thrown\r\ntogether while awaiting his return, a faint tinge of color was\r\nreturning to her face, and her eyes dimly focused upon him.\r\n\r\n\"You've worked too much, that's what it means,\" he said.  \"You see\r\nyou're tired.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm--sorry,\" she faltered, faintly.  \"I really--didn't mean to be--so\r\nweak.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind,\" he said.  \"I'll kill the brute.  His skin is certainly a\r\nbeauty.\"  With the utmost apparent indifference to Elaine's recovery,\r\nhe went at once to the clearing for the bits of old junk he had dropped.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned, his mind was still on the tiger.\r\n\r\n\"We've got to live--move about--and not be annoyed,\" he said.  \"If I\r\nhad a single rifle!  But I'll get him somehow, soon!\"\r\n\r\nElaine still remained upon the hay.\r\n\r\n\"If he doesn't get us sooner,\" she replied, a little grimly, but not as\r\none in fear.\r\n\r\n\"I shall wall up the trail,\" mused Grenville, aloud, looking about at\r\nthe quantity of rock so readily afforded.  \"That much I can do this\r\nafternoon.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat up a bit more sturdily.\r\n\r\n\"I dropped our luncheon, I suppose....  I hope to do better, later on,\r\nwhen I get more used to conditions.\"  She was mortified to think he had\r\nbeen thus promptly obliged to carry her \"home\" in his arms.\r\n\r\n\"You are doing fairly well,\" he said, in his off-hand manner.  \"We\r\nshall soon be all right.  It's a fine and tight little island.\"\r\n\r\nHer one idea was to get away as soon as possible.\r\n\r\n\"Shouldn't we put up a flag, or something, in case a steamer should\r\nhappen to be passing?\"\r\n\r\n\"As soon as I can cut a long bamboo.  I must have both tools and fire\r\nas promptly as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must be hungry,\" she remarked, arising rather weakly and going to\r\nthe end of her cave, where all the water that remained in the half of\r\nthe paw-paw shell had been carefully stored, in Grenville's absence.\r\nThen, emerging with her burden, she added, \"I meant to have your\r\nluncheon ready, but we have almost nothing left.\"\r\n\r\n\"All that you gathered was left by the tiger,\" he answered, cheerfully.\r\n\"The beast prefers more solid diet.\"  Once more descending the trail,\r\nhe presently returned with the fruits that had fallen from her arms.\r\n\r\nThey ate, as before, in the shade of her cave, for the sun on the rocks\r\nwas becoming hot.\r\n\r\n\"The wall this afternoon,\" said Grenville, as he finally concluded his\r\nsimple repast with a drink of tepid water.  \"Then our mast and signal\r\nof distress must be erected.  I shall try for fire directly.  I must\r\nmake a bow and some arrows.  A clay pit I found will provide us with\r\nearthenware utensils, and then--if only I could manage to melt some\r\nbrass----  You see, the worst of it is, no stone I've discovered on the\r\nplace is fit to use for a tool.\"\r\n\r\nElaine avoided the boyish gleaming of his gaze.  \"Are we thrust so far\r\nback as the stone age, then?  It's really as bad as that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bad?\" he said.  \"It's tremendously diverting.  I've got to begin, as\r\nit were, with my naked hands.  But fortunately, I believe, for us, the\r\nbronze and stone ages lap,\" and he drew from his pockets some bits of\r\nthe heterogeneous collection he had brought from the rotting barque.\r\n\r\n\"You have found some metal?\" Elaine inquired, excitedly.  \"But where?\"\r\n\r\n\"In a wreck that must have arrived here years ago.\"  He related as much\r\nas he thought advisable and undisturbing to the thoroughly wondering\r\ngirl.\r\n\r\nShe could see no possible use for all the rusted bronze and brass he\r\nhad earned away from the wreck so strangely discovered, but she made no\r\ndiscouraging comments to dampen an ardor which to her was not precisely\r\ncomprehensible.\r\n\r\n\"I hope I can help,\" she told him, as she had before.  \"I'm afraid I'm\r\nnot very clever.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll see,\" he answered, cheerfully.  \"Necessity is rather a strict\r\ninstructor.\"\r\n\r\nBut she could not assist him with the wall, at which he was presently\r\nperspiring.  The stones he rolled and carried to the narrowest shelf or\r\nledge that was scaled by the trail were far too heavy for her delicate\r\nhands and muscles.\r\n\r\n\"Can't I do something else?\" she begged, eager for any employment.\r\n\"There must be some work I could do.\"\r\n\r\n\"You might plait a basket of some sort,\" he said.  \"We shall need some\r\npresently.\"\r\n\r\nHe thereupon went below again, cut all he could carry of tough and\r\nlimber creepers, and, fetching them up to the shade of her cave,\r\ninstructed Elaine in such of the rudiments of basket-weaving as he\r\nhimself could readily invent, and left her busily employed.\r\n\r\nThe wall he required to prevent any possible night attack on the part\r\nof the beast that was already inclined to stalk either one of them, or\r\nboth, was not of any considerable length, owing to the narrowness of\r\nthe pass he had chosen to block with bowlders.  He had, however, to\r\nmake it thick and high.  By taking advantage of three large blocks,\r\nwhich he rolled down hill to the place selected, he secured a\r\nsubstantial foundation with comparative ease.  After that it became a\r\nmatter merely of carrying stone after stone, from their inexhaustible\r\nsupply on the summit, to lodge in rough, uneven tiers to the height\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nHe had left a narrow gateway next the natural wall that made his\r\nstructure complete.  This he could block with a heavy log, or even more\r\nstones, for the night.\r\n\r\nFor fully three hours he wrought prodigiously, returning from time to\r\ntime to Elaine, to guide and assist her with her basket.  Between them\r\nthey managed to produce from their rough material a crude, misshapen\r\nreceptacle, coarse of mesh and clumsy, yet strong and not to be\r\ndespised.  Grenville expected to use it to fetch his clay from the pit.\r\n\r\nIt was not until this product of their combined ingenuity was fairly\r\ncomplete that Grenville discovered he could split the bark of the\r\ncreepers readily, and tear out a smooth white core, like a withe, far\r\nmore suitable to their uses.  He then not only stripped out several\r\nfull-length cores, but he also found that the bark or covering thus\r\nremoved was constructed of numerous thread-like strands amazingly tough\r\nand long.  These fibers were not so readily separated as the core had\r\nbeen from the covering with which they were incorporated, although\r\ntheir recovery was not a difficult operation.  His inventive mind saw\r\nample employment for them later.\r\n\r\nThe wall was not entirely finished when, at length, he left it for the\r\nday.  He was weary in all his bone and sinew, despite the prodding of\r\nhis will.  He had made no attempt at kindling fire, and none towards\r\nprocuring a mast to erect for a flag of distress.  These were tasks\r\nthat must wait for the morrow, with the others he was eager to attack.\r\n\r\nThe dinner at sundown was necessarily a repetition of the previous\r\nmeals of the day.  It could not be followed by the cheer and comfort of\r\na fire, and the darkness, that drew on rapidly, brought a sense of\r\nchill and depression to Elaine, notwithstanding her bravery of spirit.\r\n\r\nThe wind had ceased, except for the merest intermittent puffs of breath\r\nthat floated upward from the sea.  Not even the lapping of the tide\r\nagainst the wall arose to break the silence.  The stillness was\r\npainfully profound, though Elaine's imagination depicted a hundred\r\nnocturnal brutes of the jungle, prowling in every trail and clearing,\r\nin a savage quest for blood.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the nightly tragedies were already well begun.\r\nBut it was not until some victim shrilly voiced its animal fear and\r\nagony, just beneath the towering wall, that Elaine had a realizing\r\nsense of her nearness to these creatures of the darkness, or the\r\nworking of life's inexorable laws.\r\n\r\nHer mind reverted, by natural process, to all the terrible occurrences\r\ncrowded into her life within the last couple of days--occurrences that\r\nseemed so needlessly tragic, and all the alarms excited in her breast,\r\nnot only by the frightful accident to the \"Inca,\" but likewise by the\r\nalmost unknown man upon whom she was now dependent.\r\n\r\nShe recalled with singular vividness every accent, every gesture, look,\r\nand deed that had accompanied Grenville's declaration.  She burned\r\nagain, with shame and indignation, to think of the things he had dared\r\nto say and do--the treachery done to his friend--the indignity done to\r\nherself.\r\n\r\nShe hated him now more intensely than before, since he seemed, by some\r\nenormity of purpose, to have been in some manner responsible for the\r\nfate that had brought her here in his company, absolutely at his mercy.\r\nThat his promptness of action had saved her life she willingly and\r\njustly conceded--but to fetch her here, all by herself, to an island\r\nunpeopled and awful, far from the track of ocean-going steamers--with\r\nhis threat to compel her love still ringing in her ears--this seemed to\r\noutweigh any possible service he had done or could ever accomplish.\r\n\r\nWhat would he do, she wondered, on the morrow?  When would he speak of\r\nhis passion again?  What means, in this situation, might he presently\r\nadopt to coerce the love she knew she should never bestow?\r\n\r\nThere could be no answer to her questions--least of all from the man\r\nhimself.  He, too, had fallen into silence, and a study of the vast and\r\nmerciless problems, not only of existence till their escape could be\r\neffected, but likewise as to how that escape could be attempted, in\r\nsafety, and where they must steer their ocean course to come to a land\r\nwhich should not prove inhospitable.\r\n\r\nHe seemed, for the time, to have quite forgotten the presence of the\r\ngirl at the cave.  This she finally observed.  She wondered, then, what\r\nsinister outcome his brooding might presage.\r\n\r\nKeyed to a pitch of nervous sensibility she had never experienced\r\nbefore, she retired at length within her shelter like a child thrust\r\nalone in the dark.  Much as she felt she disliked the man, she found\r\nherself most reluctant to move very far from his presence, or refuse\r\nhis protecting care.  She was certain her dread of all it meant to be\r\nhopelessly cast upon this island, with one doubtful human being only\r\nfor comfort and companionship, would haunt her to sleeplessness\r\nthroughout the night.  Yet she fell into slumber almost at once, and\r\nonly dreamed she was still awake and worried.\r\n\r\nIt was still quite early in the evening.  Elaine was finally\r\napproaching a thoroughly restful oblivion, when a low, moaning wail,\r\nand then shrill screams, abruptly ushered once more into play that\r\nhideous chorus of the morning, produced by some phenomenon of the tides.\r\n\r\n\"Sidney!  Sidney!\" came an answering cry; and Grenville arose, to see\r\nElaine running wildly towards him from her cave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE MOTHER OF INVENTION\r\n\r\nIt was not until the entire cycle of haunting sounds had been repeated\r\nfor its final time that Elaine could consent to return to her pallet of\r\ngrasses.  And even when she had once more knelt upon this improvised\r\nbed, she could not consent to resign herself to the mercies of the\r\nnight without one more glance towards Grenville's cavern.\r\n\r\nShe returned, unseen, to her door, and peered forth through the starlit\r\nnight, discerning his dimly outlined figure, as he sat before his door.\r\n\r\nHe even arose as she paused there, uncertainly.  She noted his\r\nlistening attitude, the alertness of his pose.  Then he sat once more\r\nupon the stone at his threshold, where she knew his club lay ready to\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\nA sense of security, despite her bitterness of feeling, came slowly\r\nstealing upon her.  She went back to her couch and slept.\r\n\r\nSidney, for his part, sat there alone, while hour after hour went\r\nsilently by, and the constellations hung in higher arches.  A thousand\r\nramifications of thought he pursued in his active brain.  But through\r\nthem all, like an ever recurrent _motif_, stole a troubled reminder of\r\nthe tiger, twice encountered in the day.\r\n\r\nTo slay this contemptuous, savage beast that already drooled about the\r\njaws at thoughts of a human morsel, was the one imperative business to\r\nbe promptly executed.  Elaine and himself could live on fruits, and\r\nneglect all else, without serious results, for a week, or even a month,\r\nbut this affair was not to be delayed.\r\n\r\nHe thought of pitfalls, giant traps, and automatic engines of\r\ndestruction by the score, each deadly device absurdly impracticable and\r\nbeyond all power of his achievement.  His mind, accustomed to civilized\r\nways, ran in higher ingenuities that were absolutely useless in this\r\nprimal state of their existence.\r\n\r\nWhen at length he leaned back against his wall and began to wonder if,\r\nin the end, he must arm himself with primitive man's crude bow and\r\narrow, and thus engage the master prowler of the jungle, he was ready\r\nfor Nature's claims.  He slept there, too utterly exhausted to drag\r\nhimself in to his bed.  And there Elaine found him in the morning.\r\n\r\nThat day was a long one, of varied and wearying employments.  The wall\r\nwas finished across the trail, Elaine's too widely opened cavern was\r\npartially blocked up with stone, and, at length, in addition to\r\nsearching the jungle for something particularly downy and inflammable\r\nfor tinder, to use in making fire, Grenville went with his basket down\r\nto the clay pit and fetched sufficient of this moist and plastic\r\nmaterial to mould a number of vessels.\r\n\r\nThis last useful art was not, however, immediately attempted.  Unfired\r\njugs and basins were absolutely useless--and as yet they had no fire.\r\nThe search for tinder had resulted only in producing a silken, fluffy\r\nmaterial that grew in a fat green pod.  It was moist, when found, with\r\nthe natural juices of the plant.\r\n\r\nWhile it dried in the sun, under Elaine's supervision, Grenville worked\r\nat a stout, elastic tree-branch to taper out a bow.  His stub of a\r\nknife-blade served indifferently against the close-grained wood, which,\r\nnevertheless, was obliged to yield to his persevering efforts.\r\n\r\nAt noon the weapon, save for the cord, was rudely finished.  No arrows\r\nhad been as yet provided.  Obliged at this hour to replenish the camp\r\nsupply of water, Grenville once more visited the spring.  So fresh were\r\nthe tracks of the tiger here, in the mire about the trickling stream,\r\nthat he felt they must almost be warm.  The brute was undoubtedly near\r\nat hand, but, perhaps, well fed, as before.\r\n\r\n\"There is nothing quite so important now as fire,\" was Grenville's\r\nremark, as he once more rejoined Elaine.  \"Without it we are\r\npractically helpless.  With it--there is almost nothing we may not hope\r\nto achieve.\"\r\n\r\nHe had thought of a number of extraordinary and highly important\r\nimplements and arts that only flame and glowing heat could render\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nElaine brought the fluff she had thoroughly dried, while Grenville\r\ncleaned his flint and steel.  For an hour, then, he strove in vain to\r\nignite his bit of tinder.  It was not at all an easy matter to strike a\r\nspark from the stone.  What few brilliant specks of incandescence sped\r\noccasionally downward like vigor transmuted into swiftly fading stars\r\nfrom Grenville's varied and over-eager strokes, either died on the air\r\nor missed their mark or struck it and found it uncongenial.\r\n\r\n\"This must be a vegetable asbestos,\" he finally declared.  \"If I had\r\njust a pinch of powder, this flint might recognize----  By Jove!\" and\r\nhe started at once to his feet.  \"I'm the greatest fool on legs!\"\r\n\r\n\"What seems to be the trouble?\" said Elaine, who could not possibly\r\ncomprehend his meaning.  \"Have you made some sort of mistake?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been asleep--my brain defunct!  Excuse me half a minute!\"\r\n\r\nHe started madly down the trail, running like a boy.  Before Elaine\r\ncould do more than stare in wonder at his antics, he had reached the\r\nbottom of the wall, darted across the clearing, and disappeared in the\r\njungle growth beyond.\r\n\r\nHe smashed his way hotly to the wrecked old barque, and, pawing deeply\r\nbeneath the surface of the wasting saltpeter, that had been for long\r\nsomewhat protected in the hold, promptly filled two pockets with the\r\nmineral, and went racing back as he had come.\r\n\r\nBut beyond the clearing he altered his course to enter the region once\r\nblackened by fire.  Here he went directly to the hollow tree he had\r\nonce before examined, and, wriggling inside, through the ample orifice\r\nburned out by the flames, he attacked the charred interior with his\r\nknife as if his very life depended on his haste.\r\n\r\nIn the briefest time he had chipped off more than a double handful of\r\ncrisp, but inferior, charcoal.  Retreating no less promptly than he had\r\nentered, he gathered this carefully in a giant leaf, and hastily\r\nrejoined Elaine.\r\n\r\n\"Powder!\" he said, belatedly explaining.  \"Everything lying here and\r\nready, and my brain a howling blank!\"\r\n\r\nTo Elaine this was not precisely clear.\r\n\r\n\"There is gunpowder here on the island?\"\r\n\r\n\"No!  The ingredients merely.  But any child----  Ah! here's my bit of\r\nsulphur!  There's a ton of it ready to be gathered.  Powder?  I can\r\nmake enough to blow a dozen tigers into ribbons!  The wreck is full of\r\nniter and, once we have a fire, I can burn all the jungle into\r\ncharcoal!\"\r\n\r\nThe mystery had not entirely lifted for Elaine, but this she hardly\r\nexpected.\r\n\r\n\"How can I help?\" she asked him, quietly.  \"There must be something I\r\ncan do.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a matter of grinding these materials,\" he answered, more calmly,\r\ndepositing sulphur, saltpeter, and charcoal on a rock before them.\r\n\"It's a simple composition, after all.\"\r\n\r\nBarely less feverishly than before he began a search for suitable\r\nstones to employ as mortars and pestles.  There were many small\r\nbowlders slightly hollowed by the elements, but a number of these had\r\nsurfaces ready to crumble, and were, therefore, reluctantly discarded.\r\nIn throwing about some loosely huddled fragments, to liberate a smooth,\r\nhard slab of stone that was dished from its edges to its center,\r\nGrenville was doubly rewarded by coming upon a large, thick seashell,\r\npractically perfect.\r\n\r\nWith this and the basin of harder rock, he returned at once to the\r\nshade.  He was soon reducing the charcoal, while Elaine no less\r\nindustriously attacked the lump of sulphur.\r\n\r\n\"We need a little only for a trial,\" he said, as he presently sifted\r\nout his powdered product, and began to grind the niter.  \"I wish I\r\nremembered the proportions.\"\r\n\r\nIn his haste to obtain results as soon as possible, he finally shook up\r\nand ground together a large-sized pinch from each of the three\r\nmaterials, producing thereby a grayish, unpromising mixture, decidedly\r\ntoo rich in both the charcoal and sulphur.\r\n\r\nThis he placed on a rock, a safe distance away, and attacked with his\r\nflint and steel.  Elaine had ceased her grinding operations, to stand\r\nat his side and watch.  He struck, perhaps, a dozen times before he\r\nproduced a shower of sparks--and nothing occurred.  He looked at the\r\nstuff for a moment, helplessly, discouragement swiftly lodging in his\r\nbosom.  Half-heartedly he struck the steel again.\r\n\r\nA single spark flew hotly from the flint.  It seemed to curve to the\r\noutside edge of the powder.  Instantly, however, the mixture was\r\nignited.\r\n\r\nIt did not burn in a quick, fierce flash, but more with a sputtering,\r\nimperfect combustion, productive of stifling fumes.  Grenville's hand\r\nwas slightly scorched--but his joy in the triumph was complete.\r\n\r\n\"We're kings!\" he cried, sublimely indifferent to genders.  \"We're\r\nmonarchs of all we survey!\"  He leaped up, waving his flint about his\r\nhead, his face outbeaming the sun.\r\n\r\nElaine was vaguely glad of his results.\r\n\r\n\"I'm afraid I don't understand it in the least.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all necessary,\" he informed her, candidly.  \"It's the very\r\nworst powder ever made.  My charcoal is poor and my proportions wrong,\r\nand I only half ground it all together.  But it burned!  That's enough\r\nfor me--it burned!  It assures us a fire, and I'll make a new batch,\r\nthat will go off like a Spanish revolution!\"\r\n\r\nHe went below at once to gather twigs and fuel, bits of dried grass,\r\nand other kindling, and brought a large bundle to the terrace.  More\r\ncarefully, then, he mixed and ground his succeeding sample of the\r\npowder.  Recalling more clearly the accepted formula, he increased the\r\nproportion of saltpeter to something nearer seventy-five per cent. of\r\nthe whole, approximating thus the standard long since established.\r\n\r\nAware that, when he finally came to manufacture an explosive of higher\r\nefficiency, he would do much better to wet the ingredients and later\r\ndry the finished product, he now proceeded, as before, merely to try\r\nfor a fire.\r\n\r\nThus he presently laid a train of his grayish mixture from one small\r\nheap to another, in a place selected for his trial.  Over one of the\r\npowder pyramids he arranged his combustible straws, twigs, and branches\r\nwith the nicest care.  And when, at length, he struck a white-hot star,\r\ndivinely potential, into the midst of the second heap, a hissing snake\r\nof incandescence and smoke darted swiftly along the surface of\r\nrock--and his fire leaped into being.\r\n\r\nOn the towering rock, as on an altar, the flames that meant life to the\r\nexiled pair rose goldenly bright and clear.\r\n\r\nA strange exultation in Grenville's prowess possessed Elaine, as she\r\nstood by in wonder, looking on his face.\r\n\r\n\"It shall never go out,\" he told her, presently, \"not if I can prevent\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE MASTER POACHER\r\n\r\nThere were woods in abundance about the base of the tufa cliff that\r\nwould burn almost as slowly and retain their glow about as long as the\r\nhardest of anthracite coal.\r\n\r\nYet it was not on these that Grenville depended, that particular night,\r\nto maintain the fire he had conjured from flint and steel.  All those\r\nlong dark hours he served his altar flame with fuel gathered for the\r\npurpose.  An easier method for its preservation, by means of the woods\r\nthat were promptly discovered, he adopted, however, very soon.\r\n\r\nEach day that was ushered in and closed by the island's haunting wails\r\nand chorus, now beheld some new development in the plans that Grenville\r\nwas laying.  Elaine, less disturbed by the hideous sounds, might have\r\nlearned more promptly to accept them as part of the ordeal of living in\r\nthis extraordinary fashion, had they always come at stated hours.  But,\r\nborn of the tides, they came with the tides, which, all the world over,\r\nshift with each day till every hour of the twenty-four has had its\r\nvisitation.  Like a horrid reminder of the brevity of life, the thing\r\nwas fore-ordered to rise unexpectedly, fret forgetful senses, and\r\nlinger longest, apparently, in the deadest hours of the night.\r\nConcerning her companion, her mind was far more calm.  Her distrust and\r\ndislike were unabated, but he gave her no cause for added worry.\r\n\r\nBy the third day after his fire had been accomplished, Grenville had\r\nconsiderably altered their aspects and prospects of living.  Their\r\nbamboo flagpole stood in a crevice of the highest rock, with \"rags\" of\r\nbanana leaves idly flapping out a signal of distress; a number of\r\npipkins, large and small, were grayly drying in the sun, to be\r\nsubsequently fired; his bow was strung, beside three unfeathered\r\narrows, crudely tipped with points that Sidney had pounded out of\r\nscrews; charcoal was burning, down in the blackened clearing; a number\r\nof traps and dead-falls were nearing completion; and several basket\r\nloads both of sulphur and saltpeter were stored in caverns, which the\r\nman had roofed to protect them from the rain.\r\n\r\nMuch toil had been involved in these achievements.  The bamboo pole,\r\nfor instance, had been most laboriously burned off, close to its base.\r\nTo accomplish this end, the man had carried coals of fire to the\r\nestuary swamp, created a blaze, and repeatedly heated his longest piece\r\nof brass, which had slowly charred a channel through the wood when\r\nsmartly applied to its surface.\r\n\r\nThe cord that secured the \"flag\" upon this serviceable mast, had been\r\nmade, like the string for the bow, by twisting together innumerable\r\nthreads of the fiber imbedded in the bark of the creepers.  This had\r\nthen been \"waxed\" with the glutinous ooze from the nearest rubber tree,\r\nwith which the jungle abounded.  He had also found wild sisal in the\r\nrocky places of the island.  This plant had a leaf like a bayonet,\r\nsometimes six feet long, and readily split into fibers of most\r\nastonishing strength, especially when three were braided into a cord.\r\n\r\nConsiderably to Grenville's amazement, the molding of jugs, some\r\ncrucibles, and other essential vessels suggested by the presence of the\r\nclay, was not at all a simple matter.  His material, which at first was\r\nmixed too soft, was readily stiffened to a workable consistency, and\r\nthe bases and first six inches or more of flaring walls of his pipkins\r\nhad been fashioned as a child would fashion \"pies.\"  It was when he\r\nundertook to crimp and contract this flaring rim that the craftsmanship\r\nknown to the potter required once again to be evolved.\r\n\r\nFor a time the longer he wrought at the stubborn material the more\r\ncompletely Grenville was defeated by the clay.  He discovered at last,\r\nas similar workmen in every age and clime have ultimately discovered,\r\nthat potteries thus constructed by hand must be built up in rings, one\r\nring at a time, especially where the walls draw in to an ever narrowing\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nWhen, at length, this simple fact had been established--the first\r\nsuccess having come to Elaine, whose feminine wit had been nimbler far\r\nthan the man's--a highly respectable family of jugs and useful\r\nreceptacles had rapidly come into being.\r\n\r\nMid-afternoon of this busy day found Grenville engrossed with his\r\nlabors.  Despite the fact they had not yet dined on anything but fruit,\r\nhe was preparing salt for meat.  The shell he had found was full of\r\nwater from the sea, evaporating rapidly in a bed of hot ashes and\r\ncoals.  This, however, was resigned to Elaine's efficient vigilance,\r\nwhile Sidney worked absorbingly to complete a number of small clay\r\nmolds designed for the casting of tools.\r\n\r\nWhen, at length, the last of these was done and set aside to dry with\r\nthe jugs and assorted vessels, he glanced briefly up at the sun.  There\r\nwere several hours of this blazing light remaining.  Resolved in one\r\nmoment to hasten to the jungle with his bow and the unfeathered arrows,\r\nwhich might be relied upon at easy range to fly sufficiently straight\r\nfor all his purposes, Grenville determined in the next to make them a\r\nbit more certain.\r\n\r\nA branch and leaf from a freshly despoiled banana plant had suggested\r\n\"feathers\" for his shafts.  It was the work of a moment only to cut out\r\nand trim a slender bit of the fibrous branch from which the leaf\r\nsubstance projected.  The leaf part itself, which was rather tough, and\r\nconsiderably like a stiffened cloth in texture, he cut to shape no less\r\nquickly.  Then, binding on each of the arrows a trio of these\r\nimprovised \"rudders,\" he took up his club, informed Elaine he might be\r\nabsent half an hour, and descended at once to the clearing.\r\n\r\nHis porcupine, seen no less than half a dozen times when his arms had\r\nbeen burdened, or his club was not at hand, was not to be found for all\r\nhis elaborate searching, now that he was desirable for dinner.\r\nNaturally, Grenville had no particular preference for porcupine where\r\npheasants were not impossible.  But the fact that the bristling\r\nhedgehog is not to be despised, he knew from past experience.\r\nMoreover, he had fondly hoped this somewhat stupid quarry might be\r\nreadily found and taken.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that for three days past not a sign had been\r\nvouchsafed him of the tiger, Grenville took to himself no fulsome sense\r\nof security as he made his way slowly through the jungle, towards the\r\nestuary swamp.  The island was small; the brute was always near--and\r\nsome day the contest between they two must be waged to a definite\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nThe axiom is old that the most game is seen when the huntsman has no\r\nweapon.  It seemed to Grenville, slipping as noiselessly as possible\r\ndown towards the water, where birds and beasts had always been\r\nencountered, that the island had been suddenly deserted.  He saw not a\r\nthing, beyond the vaguest movements in the trees, perhaps for the very\r\nfact he moved so cautiously, and thereby assumed an aspect that was\r\ncrafty, sinister, or suspicious.\r\n\r\nSome reptile glided to the water, starting a ripple on the surface, but\r\nnot even its head was visible to the watchful eyes of the man.  An\r\narrow was notched upon his bow, and, while the practice in which he had\r\nindulged had been far too brief to develop the skill he knew he might\r\nfinally acquire, Sidney was certain that up to a range of five or ten\r\nyards his shaft would prove fairly deadly.\r\n\r\nHe had heretofore seen no game at all that was not, in fact, almost\r\nunder his very feet.  Of the pheasants, flushed before on at least\r\nthree separate occasions, he detected not so much as a hint.  The\r\nmonkeys were silent.  Not even the noisy parrots flew out with their\r\nusual disturbance.  All about the growth of bamboo he trod, wherever a\r\nspace was open, but in vain.\r\n\r\nReflecting that the pheasants might have gone beyond, to a section\r\nwhere rocks and shrubbery doubtless afforded the seeds or berries on\r\nwhich they would probably feed, he started more briskly towards the\r\ntrail that would take him past the wreck.\r\n\r\nHe had not entirely cleared the bamboo growth when, abruptly, there in\r\nthe open space before him, hardly fifteen feet away, a wild hog paused,\r\nfairly startled to inaction where it had entered the clearing from the\r\njungle.  It had turned its head to stare at the man inquiringly.  Its\r\ntwo little eyes, maliciously gleaming, increased its threatening aspect\r\nas the bristles slowly rose on its back.\r\n\r\nWithout making the slightest unnecessary movement, Grenville raised his\r\nbow.  He drew the arrow fairly to the head.  A sharp twang followed\r\ninstantly.  A streak of gray sped swiftly and obliquely towards the\r\nearth.  Then, for a second, Grenville saw the stout shaft quiver where\r\nit was buried in the base of the creature's neck.\r\n\r\nOne challenging grunt the wild hog uttered, starting as if to charge.\r\nBut the arrow had shattered the nerves that make for rage and courage,\r\ncleaving to the seat of life itself.\r\n\r\nThe boar staggered blindly, instinctively, back to the dense,\r\nconcealing jungle.\r\n\r\nGrenville heard it grunt once savagely, as it broke its way past\r\ninterfering branches of the growth.  He realized it was escaping, that\r\nit might reach a hole or other concealment before it fell, and cheat\r\nhim of his dinner.\r\n\r\nHe dropped his bow, as a useless impediment in such a tangle, and\r\nplunged in a reckless manner through the shrubbery and vines where his\r\nquarry was no longer in sight.\r\n\r\nThe hog must have stumbled forward with considerable speed.  A\r\nvibrating palm, ten feet ahead of his position, urged Sidney\r\nimpulsively forward.  He was baffled and retarded in a most\r\nexasperating fashion by the creepers woven through the thicket.\r\n\r\nObliged to make a slight detour, he smashed a path between two stout\r\nbanana palms--and came upon a hidden clearing.  There was one\r\nunexpectedly violent movement of the growth just opposite, and there he\r\nthought his hog was dying.\r\n\r\nInstantly upon his startled vision impinged a blot of yellow color.\r\nThe full active form of the tiger was immediately revealed, as the\r\nbrute leaped forth and sank his teeth in the neck of the sinking boar.\r\n\r\nThere was one shrill mort cry only as the hog became inert.  Half\r\nraising the limber form in his massive jaws, the while his eyes wildly\r\nblazed his challenge to and defiance of the man who had halted in the\r\nclearing, the great supple creature, with the studded gold band about\r\nhis neck, slowly strode once more within the jungle.\r\n\r\nWith a horribly disquieting comprehension of the fact he had doubtless\r\nbeen stalked for the past half hour, which fully accounted for the\r\nabsence of game along the trails, Grenville retreated from the place.\r\nWhy he had not been leaped upon and instantly slain was too much to\r\nunderstand--unless the unknown beings who had placed a collar, like a\r\nbadge of inferiority, upon the animal's neck, had so impressed him with\r\na dread of man that he dared not make an attack.\r\n\r\nAll zest for the hunt had departed from his being when Sidney recovered\r\nhis bow.  Anger and exasperation took its place as he reflected on the\r\nease with which this insolent, fearless beast could continue to rob him\r\nof his quarry.  And one day, he knew, the animal's boldness would\r\nincrease to a point where a treacherous leap would restore his\r\nundisputed mastery of all this bit of land.\r\n\r\n\"I'll kill him!\" said Grenville, unexcitedly.  \"I'll blow him clean out\r\nof his skin!\"\r\n\r\nHe went boldly down to the rotting wreck, climbed eagerly up to the\r\nslanted cabin, and saluted the dead man, sitting there in chains.\r\n\r\n\"Brother, I've come for the cannon,\" he said.  \"There's little else\r\nleft for you to guard.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough the small bit of ordnance would make a load of fully fifty\r\npounds, Grenville determined, then and there, to make a clean sweep of\r\nall the old hulk's remaining bits of brass and bronze not appropriated\r\nearlier.  He, therefore, heaved the cannon out through a gap in the\r\nrotting planks, and began a hurried overhauling of everything left in\r\nthe lockers.\r\n\r\nHe had drawn out coil upon coil of ancient cordage, that broke like\r\nwetted paper in his hands, before the largest and last of the lockers\r\nhad been emptied of its junk.  This was a deep and comparatively sound\r\nsort of box beneath a former bunk.  Its interior was absolutely dark.\r\n\r\nUnwilling to overlook the slightest metal object, Grenville got down on\r\nhis hands and knees, to peer to the farthest corner.  There seemed to\r\nbe nothing remaining in the place.  Nevertheless, he reached well\r\ninside and swept his hand about the walls, till it came to a slight\r\nobstruction.\r\n\r\nThis was a screw-head, so far as he could determine, in the planking\r\njust to the left of the door, in one of the nearest corners.  He\r\npressed rather heavily against the moldy woodwork, and his fist went\r\nthrough, breaking away a decayed square of wood that had once been a\r\ntiny door.\r\n\r\nConvinced at once that a small and, heretofore, undiscovered locker, of\r\ninsignificant dimensions, had been made between the walls of two of the\r\nusual compartments, he conceived it to be a secret hiding-place, and\r\nstrained the full length of his reaching arm, blindly to explore its\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nHe could not touch its wall at the rear without crawling fully inside\r\nthe larger locker, and for this he felt but little relish.  With a plan\r\nworth two of that discomfiting scheme, he arose and kicked out the\r\npaneling from the front of the narrow box.\r\n\r\nOnce more he knelt, and thrust his arm to the end of the place.  His\r\nfingers came gropingly upon a round, metallic object, wedged tightly\r\ndown between two supports of wood.  He broke it out in his vigorous\r\nway, and drew it to the light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nA MYSTERY\r\n\r\nWith an odd sensation tingling in his veins, Grenville examined his\r\nfind.\r\n\r\nIt was merely a cylinder, made of brass, fully three inches in\r\ndiameter, and, perhaps, eight inches long.  Its cap was rusted so\r\nfirmly in place that he could not possibly remove it.  He gave the tube\r\na shake.  There was something inside, but its weight was exceedingly\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nOnce more he knelt before the secret locker to examine all its walls.\r\nBut although his fingers finally played upon every square inch of the\r\nsides and ceiling, there was nothing further to be found.  Apparently\r\nthe only \"treasure\" the place had concealed was contained within the\r\ntube.\r\n\r\nHe thought of a score of documents the one-time captain of the barque\r\nmight have thus desired to preserve, but the sun was rapidly nearing\r\nits purple horizon, and the old ship's hold was growing dark.\r\nGrenville gathered the last of the metal spoils he had found in an\r\nempty box, half rotted, on the floor.  The tube he thrust firmly in his\r\npocket.\r\n\r\nWhat with the cannon balanced on his shoulder, his box of rusted metal\r\nhugged beneath his arm, and his bow, club, and arrows clutched tightly\r\nin his hand, he presented a singular figure as he finally made his way\r\nalong the darkening trail, and came at length to the clearing, to be\r\nhailed from the heights by Elaine.\r\n\r\n\"Just for the sake of variety,\" he said, when he came to the terrace\r\nwith his burdens, \"we'll eat one more dinner of fruit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't think what you had killed,\" said Elaine, \"when I saw you\r\ncoming with this,\" and she placed her foot on the cannon he had gladly\r\ndropped to the ground.  \"What is it, anyway?\"\r\n\r\n\"A pop-gun,\" he said, \"to tickle my friend the tiger.\"\r\n\r\nShe was instantly apprehensive.  \"You have met him again?\"\r\n\r\nHe had no intention of arousing her alarm.\r\n\r\n\"The brute is still about the island.  I should like his skin for a\r\nrug.\"\r\n\r\n\"You could really shoot him with this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--I shall mount it, in any case, though I have my doubts of his\r\nstanding while I blow a few rocks through his person.\"\r\n\r\nWhen he went for a fresh supply of fruits he brought up a log some four\r\nor five feet in length, with a burned-off prong at its end.  This he\r\nintended to prepare as a \"carriage\" for the gun.  He placed the pronged\r\nend down in his fire, to burn out a niche for the little brass piece,\r\nwhich he cleaned of its mud then and there.\r\n\r\nHis preliminary work on the bit of ordnance was soon concluded.  When\r\nhis log had burned to a moderate depth, he removed it to a near-by rock\r\nand gouged the charred portions away.  Into the hollow thus rudely\r\nformed, the breach of the gun loosely fitted, ready to be firmly bound\r\nin place.\r\n\r\nBut the day was done, and Elaine had spread their \"table,\" to which\r\nSidney was glad to repair.\r\n\r\nHe had mentioned nothing of the tube still fatly bulging his pocket.\r\nUntil he should first determine what the cylinder contained, he meant\r\nto arouse no unnecessary speculations in the breast of his companion.\r\nHow much she might yet have to know of the barque and the mummy chained\r\nin its cabin he could not determine to-night.  That something sinister\r\nlurked behind the mystery which this and the two headless skeletons\r\ninvolved was his constantly growing conviction.\r\n\r\nIt was not until night was heavily down, and Elaine had crept gladly to\r\nthe comfort of her cave, that Grenville produced the brass cylinder,\r\nand stirred up new flames of his fire.\r\n\r\nThen, sitting alone in the ruddy glow, with a rock for a stool, and\r\nanother before him for an anvil, he scraped all he could of the\r\ngreenish oxidation from the cover of the tube, and tried, as before, to\r\nwrench it off.  The stubborn parts remained solidly rusted together.\r\n\r\nThis he had apparently expected.  For he took up a rock of convenient\r\nsize and, gently beating the cylinder just below its union with the\r\ncover, he bent it slightly inward about its entire circumference,\r\nmeanwhile pausing from time to time to thrust his knife between the\r\ncemented pieces and force them a little apart.\r\n\r\nThe tube was considerably mangled by this process, while the cover\r\nstill adhered.  In a final burst of impatience, Grenville thrust the\r\nbattered cap in the crevice between two bowlders and wrenched it\r\nroughly away.\r\n\r\nThen he turned the hollow tube to the light, revealing, within, the\r\nedge of some document, thick and loosely rolled.  This he readily\r\nremoved and straightened in his hands, placing the tube beneath his arm.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the parchment seemed, despite the firelight upon it, a\r\nmere blank square, of leathery texture and weight.  Then he fancied he\r\nsaw upon its surface some manner of writing, or signs.\r\n\r\nHe resumed his seat and held the thing to the fullest light of the\r\nflames.  It was yellowish tan in color, a trifle stiff, and inclined to\r\ncurl to the shape it had held so long.  Grenville turned it over, so\r\ndim were the characters it bore.  There was nothing, however, on its\r\nouter side, wherefore he bent more closely towards his wavering light\r\nabove such signs as he could finally discern.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the fact that he began by expecting to find some ordinary map,\r\nor printed or written characters, for a short time baffled his wits.\r\nHowbeit, he began at length to discover the fact that a few large signs\r\nor hieroglyphics had been rudely sketched upon the parchment.  When\r\nthis discovery was finally confirmed, he had still considerable\r\ndifficulty in tracing the lines that comprised these singular designs.\r\n\r\nThe firelight cast dark shadows in certain crease-like traceries that\r\nfolds in the substance had formed.  It was not until he presently\r\nmanaged to discriminate between these mere wrinkles and the \"writing,\"\r\nthat he made the slightest progress.  His eyes at last became more keen\r\nto follow the artist's meaning.  With his stub of a pencil, on a\r\nwhittled bit of wood, he began to copy what he \"read.\"\r\n\r\nThe result was, crudely, this:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: parchment with signs and hieroglyphics]\r\n\r\nIt was not a map; it could hardly be a message--unless expressed in\r\nsome short-hand system heretofore unknown--yet it must at some time or\r\nother have been accounted important to have been so elaborately\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nGrenville turned it upside down, compared his copy with the original\r\nrepeatedly, and then examined the parchment with most minute\r\nparticularity in search of some smaller writing to explain these\r\nmysterious signs.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing further to be seen--at least by the light of his\r\nfire.  Two of the symbols only did he recognize as ever having come to\r\nhis attention before.  These were, first, the lines like a series of\r\nM's, and second the oval, about a human figure.  This last suggested\r\nunmistakably an ancient Egyptian cartouch--the name or title of a king.\r\nBut containing one sign only, and that apparently representing a mummy,\r\nit puzzled the inventor no less than the pyramids and curves.\r\n\r\nThat some either crude or crafty mind had combined this mixture of\r\nEgyptian and nondescript hieroglyphics with intent to reveal some\r\nsecret message or information to other initiated beings, while\r\nconcealing its import from all accidental beholders of the script,\r\nseemed to Grenville perfectly obvious.\r\n\r\nHe sat for three hours replenishing the fire and goading his brain for\r\na key to the puzzle, before it occurred to his mind at last the tube\r\nmight contain the explanation.\r\n\r\nAll this while he had held it beneath his arm, hard pressed against his\r\nbody.  As he peered down its dark interior once more, he likewise\r\nthrust in his fingers.  It was they that discovered and fastened upon\r\nanother sheet of something he had missed.\r\n\r\nThis clung so close to the tube's metal walls he wetted his finger to\r\nremove it.  The light then shone opaquely through its substance.  It\r\nwas ordinary foolscap paper, the half of a sheet, gone yellowish with\r\nage, but otherwise very well preserved.\r\n\r\nIt was covered with roughly scrawled characters.\r\n\r\nGrenville glanced it through--and irrelevantly longed for a pipe.  He\r\nfelt he should like some good tobacco to assist in the puzzle's\r\nsolution.\r\n\r\nHe felt convinced, however, that a crude example of the simplest, most\r\nprimitive cipher was contained upon the sheet.  Should the words later\r\nprove to be in English he could finally read it all.  He began to\r\ncompare the recurrence of the various symbols at once, discovering that\r\nthe sign in the form of a cross had been used no less than fourteen\r\ntimes, and was therefore almost certainly E.  The next in importance\r\nwas the figure 3, which he felt might be either A, or N, or S, since\r\nthese, after E, are among the characters in English spelling most\r\nfrequently employed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: second message]\r\n\r\nOn another clean chip of whittled wood he jotted down a few of the\r\n\"words\" with E's in each instance substituted for the crosses, and then\r\nbegan attempting to make clear sense by substituting A's, N's, and S's\r\nfor the figure three, the figure one, and open squares, which, he\r\nfound, had been often represented.\r\n\r\nIt was a blind and tedious business.  His fire burned low, in his\r\nabsorption, and the midnight constellations marched past the zenith of\r\nthe heavens before he finally realized the folly of his quest.\r\n\r\n\"It's not a bit of good in the world, if I knew all about it,\" he\r\nfinally confessed, \"no matter what it means.\"\r\n\r\nHe went to bed.  But he did not sleep.  Those singular pyramids and the\r\ncipher still lingered before his inner vision.  What was the mystery\r\nhidden behind the dead man chained in the rotting barque, the headless\r\nskeletons lying near the swamp, and now these documents, found in the\r\ntube and so carefully concealed?\r\n\r\n\"I give it up,\" he told himself at last, in an effort to dismiss it all\r\nand compose his active brain.  \"I wish I had a stouter tube to make a\r\ngood bomb for the tiger.\"\r\n\r\nHe thought perhaps he could use the oxidized cylinder as it was, and\r\nbegan thereupon to wonder how he should make a fuse by which its powder\r\ncontents might be ignited.  Thus he drowsed off at last, with fantastic\r\ndreams swiftly solving the sum of his problems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nAMBITIOUS PLANS\r\n\r\nGrenville awoke with a brilliant idea, born in his brain as he slept.\r\n\r\nIt was not concerned with the documents found in the old brass\r\nreceptacle, but entirely with the tiger.  He knew how to fashion a fuse.\r\n\r\nThe creepers had answered this latest need, with their bark so readily\r\nhollowed.  He had burned up yards of the drying stuff with the core\r\nremoved, all of it shrunk and twisted tight, like long coils of\r\nvegetable tubing.  He had only to fill it with his powder while green,\r\nand then let it dry in the sun.\r\n\r\nHe could likewise fill the useless cylinder, wrap it about to increase\r\nits resistance to the powder--and thereby render its explosion far more\r\nviolent.  If, after that, a chance were presented to ignite it under\r\nthe tiger----\r\n\r\nIt was possible always, he confessed, the tiger might prove unwilling.\r\nHowever, both the cannon and bomb should be immediately prepared.\r\nThere could be no peace upon the island while the brute remained alive.\r\n\r\nAll thoughts of the cipher were postponed for evening recreation.  The\r\nday's work began after breakfast in preparing large quantities of\r\npowder.\r\n\r\nAt this Elaine assisted.  She was glad of any employment.  No less in\r\nher veins than in Grenville's the promptings of being in the primitive\r\nwere daily surging stronger.  Like himself, she was hungry for meat;\r\nand while she had no thoughts of turning Amazon herself, she felt an\r\nincreasing interest in all that Grenville was attempting in his task of\r\ncoping with nature.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Sidney was daily assuming a wild and unkempt aspect that he\r\ncould not possibly avoid.  His beard was an unbecoming stubble that he\r\nwas powerless to shave; his hair was uncombed and a trifle long; his\r\nclothing was not without its rents.  But what an active, muscular being\r\nhe appeared, as he moved about at his work!  He seemed so thoroughly\r\nfearless, so competent and at home with naked Nature.  His\r\nthoughtfulness, moreover, had no limits, and neither had his cheer.  He\r\nhad made no further disquieting advances, but seemed rather to have\r\nforgotten, utterly, the lawless emotions to which he had one day given\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThis day it was he started the fires to bake his vessels of clay.  They\r\nwere all sufficiently dry for the purpose, and, huddled together, a bit\r\nremoved, in a rudely constructed furnace made of rock, were piled about\r\nwith abundant fuel to provide an even heat.\r\n\r\nThe morning was sped between the various duties.  Some ten or more\r\npounds of powder Grenville finally stored in his cave.  The labor of\r\ngrinding and mixing had undergone many interruptions while he attended\r\nthe fire about his jugs.  He finally fetched some creepers from the\r\ngrowth and, stripping out the pliable cores, poured powder in several\r\nof the hollow coverings, bound them together, here and there, with\r\nfibers, and placed them out on the rocks to dry.\r\n\r\nWith the withes thus provided to his hand, the cannon was bound upon\r\nthe log he had hollowed a bit to receive it.  This he knew to be crude\r\nand, perhaps, even quite insufficient, but the gun was, in any event,\r\nfar too unwieldy for use against the tiger, unless the brute should\r\ndeliberately pose as a target, in the clearing down below.\r\n\r\nThat mid-day the porcupine once more volunteered for dinner.  His\r\nservices were accepted.  Grenville dispatched him with a club--and\r\nskinned him in the thicket.  He was far too considerate of a woman's\r\nsensibilities to fetch the creature into camp, with his arsenal of\r\nspears still upon him.  But the task of removing the hedgehog's hide\r\nwas amazingly difficult.\r\n\r\nAware of two important facts--namely, that meat too freshly cooked is\r\ncertain to be tough, while even fresh meat for three hours wrapped in\r\npaw-paw leaves becomes incredibly tender, Grenville lost no time, when\r\nthe skinning was done, in thoroughly swaddling his \"game.\"  He had\r\ncarved it up for more convenient handling.  When he finally brought it\r\nfor Elaine to see, it looked decidedly attractive.\r\n\r\n\"I shall save some scraps for bait,\" he said.  \"To-morrow we'll try for\r\nfish.\"\r\n\r\nWhat with carving a number of tough, wooden hooks, preparing some line\r\nfrom various fibers, and supplying new fuel to the flames that were\r\nfiring his needed potteries, his remaining hours were full.\r\n\r\nAt length, in preparation for their dinner of meat, he went below, dug\r\na hole somewhat laboriously in the sand and earth of the clearing, and\r\nstarted another brisk fire in the hollow thus created, Elaine tossing\r\ndown a few glowing twigs for the purpose.\r\n\r\nAnd how brave she looked, he paused to note, as she came to the brink\r\nto be of this much assistance!  How beautiful she was--and how delicate\r\nshe seemed, to be cast into such conditions!  Despite her sturdiness of\r\nheart and limb, she had always been tenderly reared.  How far might she\r\ngo, enduring this life, reduced to savagery?\r\n\r\nThese were thoughts that had come and been banished from his mind\r\ninnumerable times.  There was nothing he could do to alter or even\r\ngreatly alleviate the hardships by which she was surrounded.  Her\r\naloofness from personal contact with himself, even her constant\r\nsuspicions of his motives, and her lingering indignation for what he\r\nhad done, he felt every hour of the day.  But he could not have begged\r\nher forgiveness if he would--and would not have done so if he could.\r\n\r\nHow long would it last, he asked himself--and what would be the end?\r\nWould no ship ever come--or how long might it be till succor finally\r\narrived?  Would a search be made for the missing boat that had gone to\r\nthe bottom of the sea?  Or, before this could happen, would smaller\r\ncraft arrive--the strange, swift craft of these eastern waters, manned\r\nby fanatical outlaws, pirates, or even the wild, head-hunting Dyaks,\r\nwho had probably been here before?\r\n\r\nWhen he finally placed his meat in the pit, where the fire had burned\r\ndown to glowing embers, his mind was filled with the many plans he was\r\nimpatient to materialize without another half hour's delay.  He covered\r\nthe leaf-and-clay-wrapped dinner, first with portions of the coals and\r\nheated ashes, and then with all the sand he had dug to make his natural\r\noven, after which he returned to the terrace.\r\n\r\nNeither the process of cooking, nor that of firing his earthenware\r\ncould be hastened now by Grenville's presence..  He saw that his\r\npottery furnace was properly supplied with fuel, and then sat down\r\nwhere Elaine was busily plaiting a flat sort of mat with withes she had\r\nsomehow split to half their former size, and there he began to carve at\r\nsome slender branches of wood he had brought from down below.\r\n\r\n\"What are you making?\" he presently asked, as he watched her nimble\r\nfingers at their task.\r\n\r\n\"A platter for the meat,\" she told him, briefly.  \"And what are your\r\nsticks to become?\"\r\n\r\n\"Forks for the same.  I hope we shall need no knives....  I must soon\r\nfind time to dig about and, perhaps, unearth some yams.  They are not\r\nso good as potatoes, but they answer at a pinch.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have planned so many things to accomplish,\" she said.  \"Do you\r\nthink you shall ever have the time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't tell, but meantime I thoroughly enjoy this wresting an existence\r\nfrom more or less stubborn conditions.  Just as soon as I eliminate the\r\ntiger I shall melt up my pieces of metal to make a number of tools.\"\r\n\r\nElaine looked up at the man in wonder, but not incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"What perfect confidence you seem to have in your ability to accomplish\r\ndifficult things.\"\r\n\r\nHis utterance sank a tone lower as he answered:\r\n\r\n\"What I say I'll do--I'll do.  What I say I'll have--I'll have.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the first word he had spoken since their coming to the island\r\nthat might have been construed as a survival of the feelings he had\r\ndemonstrated on the steamer.\r\n\r\nElaine felt her whole being suddenly burn with strange excitement.  She\r\nfelt the underlying significance of his speech, and her soul was\r\ninstantly bristling with defiance.\r\n\r\nHis words went too deep and were uttered too gravely for any mere idle\r\nboasting.  She had already seen, and partially acknowledged, the power\r\nthat lay in this strong man's hands to compel his desired ends.  She\r\nfelt this potency emanating from him now--and resented the fact that\r\nshe herself had been as much selected as the tiger for his ultimate\r\nconquering.\r\n\r\nShe was angry again on the instant, ready to fight like a very little\r\ndemon, should he dare so much as lay a finger on her hand.  She\r\nresolved anew that, though a hundred years should pass before they two\r\nescaped this island exile, not the tiniest bud of answering love should\r\never sprout in her breast.\r\n\r\nFor the past few days she had felt a new sense of security and ease.\r\nThe man with whom she was working out this singular and intimate\r\nexistence had made no sign of renewing his advances, had seemed to\r\nforget he had ever broached the subject of his passion, and had been a\r\nmost agreeable companion, cheerful, resourceful, and courageous to the\r\nlast degree.\r\n\r\nNow that she knew what unworthy thoughts still lingered beneath the\r\nsurface of his calm, indifferent demeanor, not even their earlier\r\nfriendship seemed to her possible again--and for this she was\r\ndisappointed and annoyed.\r\n\r\nHer glance had fallen instantly back to her work.  That her color\r\nburned up, to the tips of her ears for Grenville to see and, perhaps,\r\nenjoy, she felt with added irritation.  But she would not confess, by\r\nword or deed, she understood the meaning of his speech.\r\n\r\nWhen she spoke she employed a quiet and common-place tone of voice, and\r\nreturned to impersonal subjects.\r\n\r\n\"I can understand,\" she said, \"how you might possibly shoot the tiger,\r\nbut I thought one needed furnaces, tall chimneys, and things, to melt\r\nup bronze and brass.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead right,\" he answered, readily.  \"You see, you've got such a grasp\r\non things that I never cease to be surprised--and delighted.  I've\r\nengaged quite a chimney already.\"\r\n\r\nShe forced herself to continue the conversation, if only by way of\r\nignoring the personal element of his answer.\r\n\r\n\"Engaged a chimney?\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll see about that, later.  If getting the tiger were only half as\r\neasy as some of the other things I expect to accomplish, I'd certainly\r\nbe tickled clean to death.\"\r\n\r\nShe felt--she almost knew, indeed---that she and her love were\r\nclassified among the things he expected to \"accomplish\" so easily at\r\nlast, and her hot resentment burned hotter.  She was tempted to flash\r\nout her wildest cry of the loathing--the bitter, eternal loathing--his\r\nwords had begotten in her bosom.  She was tempted again to a desperate\r\nwish that the tiger might rend him in pieces--as _she_ would do if ever\r\nhe touched her again.  But she dared not trust herself to speak, or\r\neven to show, by the slightest sign, that his threat was comprehended.\r\nShe clung in desperation to the subject she felt to be safe.\r\n\r\n\"Then--you do think the tiger dangerous--hard, at least, to kill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I wouldn't call him exactly plum pudding and gravy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your cannon would kill him, though, of course?\"\r\n\r\n\"If he'd pose in front of the muzzle, a rod or so away.\"\r\n\r\nA cold chill crept along her nerves at thoughts of the savage animal\r\nshe herself had twice encountered.  She wondered just what Grenville's\r\nmethod would be--in overcoming some of the things he had vowed to\r\nconquer.\r\n\r\n\"You hardly expect to shoot the creature, then, after all?\"\r\n\r\nHe held up the fork he was carving, for critical examination.\r\n\r\n\"I'm rather inclined to favor the plan of leaving a bait in the jungle,\r\nand letting go a bomb when he comes to dine.\"\r\n\r\nHer natural concern for the man's own safety could not be long expelled.\r\n\r\n\"How shall you know when he comes?\" she inquired, and she dared look up\r\nas before.\r\n\r\nGrenville continued to bend his gaze on his labor.\r\n\r\n\"I expect to hang around and see.\"\r\n\r\nA sudden fear and sinking of the vitals seized her, unaware.\r\n\r\n\"But--doesn't a tiger usually feed at night?\"\r\n\r\n\"His club hours are usually rather late, I believe.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you'll wait around for him to come in the dark?\"\r\n\r\n\"What else can I do?  Can't expect him to 'phone me he's arrived.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" she said, impulsively, \"couldn't we build a wall of stone around\r\nenough of the fruit for just ourselves?  I could help at that.  I'd do\r\nso gladly!\"\r\n\r\nIf an exquisite thrill shot directly to the deeps of Grenville's\r\nnature--a thrill aroused by her courage, her generous spirit, her\r\nhonest and helpful sympathy--he permitted himself to make no sign.\r\nAlso, he took no fulsome flattery to his soul.  But he pictured her\r\nforth, with bleeding hands, and torn and grimy garments, as she rolled\r\nand carried great stones to the brink, to supply him with blocks for a\r\nwall; and his spirit was wondrously glad to think he had made no error\r\nof judgment in appraising her character.\r\n\r\nThat all she could do she would do, as mere assistance--do for anyone\r\nelse in a similar situation, he comprehended fully.  But he felt not a\r\nwhit less exultant for the knowledge of the fact.  She was never for a\r\nmoment a mere useless dependent.  She was daily, aye, hourly, assisting\r\nin his wholly unequal combat for their lives, and this was a joy to his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nBut he spoke with his usual bluntness, and without a single hint of\r\nsympathy in all she had eagerly suggested.\r\n\r\n\"Wholly impractical scheme.  I've thought of a dozen just as poor.\"\r\n\r\nElaine was instantly sorry she had proffered him her help.  She placed\r\na withe between her teeth, bit through it neatly, and began to divide\r\nit with her fingers.\r\n\r\n\"Here, don't do that.  You'll spoil your teeth,\" said Grenville,\r\nbrusquely.  \"I'll split you enough for half a day.\"\r\n\r\nShe made no reply as he went at the withes and split them with skillful\r\nease, but she hoped he could feel, through some sensitive chord, how\r\nintensely she disliked him.\r\n\r\nHe could not.  \"I've been thinking,\" he said, \"I may be obliged to make\r\na loom to weave these fibers into some sort of cloth for garments.  May\r\nneed them before we get away.\"\r\n\r\nElaine once more responded, in her honest, impulsive manner.\r\n\r\n\"I could knit some things, I'm sure, if you'd cut me a pair of needles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Cut 'em to-night,\" he answered.  \"That meat must be done, and my\r\npotteries need attention.\"\r\n\r\nHe dropped in her lap the forks he had roughly completed, and strode\r\naway to his fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nA MIDNIGHT VISITOR\r\n\r\nThe porcupine dinner was good.  In its ball of clay, Grenville brought\r\nit to the cave in the basket that he used for heavy burdens.\r\n\r\nIt was far too hot to be handled carelessly.  And when he broke away\r\nthe earthy covering and leaves, and arranged the steaming pieces on the\r\nplatter Elaine had prepared, it was perfectly cooked, as tender as\r\nquail, and of a flavor surprisingly fine.\r\n\r\nThe banquet, however, would have been immeasurably improved by the\r\ncommonest of bread and potatoes.  To provide some palatable substitute\r\nfor these essential commonplaces of civilization became another of\r\nGrenville's problems, which, he told himself, he must tackle--after the\r\ntiger.\r\n\r\nEverything was after the tiger, or else over-fraught with danger.  The\r\nthought of this made Grenville fret more than anything demanding his\r\nattention.  That night, when Elaine had finally retired, he went to his\r\nfuses, broke off a length, and returned to light it at his fire.  It\r\nwas still too damp, from the juices of the plant, to burn efficiently.\r\nHis bomb he, therefore, would not make until the following afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe fire about his potteries he was now permitting to die.  It could\r\nnot be altogether abandoned, since a too sudden cooling of the vessels\r\nwould crack and ruin every one.  Therefore, from time to time, he went\r\nto the furnace to regulate the heat.  He had leveled a rock for a\r\ntable, at the fireplace near his cave, and on this he finally spread\r\nthe mysterious paper and parchment recovered from the tube.\r\n\r\nThey had been all day neglected.  Grenville had thoroughly intended a\r\ndaylight examination of the parchment, concerning the nature of which\r\nhe was considerably in doubt.\r\n\r\nA new supply of whittled wooden \"tablets\" on which to write lay ready\r\nto his hand.  Scratching at his head with his pencil, he studied the\r\nhieroglyphics for an hour or more before he returned to the written\r\nsheet with the scrawl spelled out in cipher.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, his mind refused the task on which he was\r\nendeavoring to focus his attention.  Despite his utmost efforts, his\r\nthoughts would return to Elaine.  He would have given almost his hope\r\nof eternity to secure her absolute comfort and freedom from anxiety.\r\nAnd, inasmuch as the tiger was responsible for much of her worry, his\r\nmind was made up that a trial should be made to slay the brute without\r\nanother day's delay....  It is always so easy to plan!\r\n\r\nHe was finally staring straight into the fire, though his hand still\r\nrested on the parchment and the paper.  The flames sank lower and\r\nlower, wavering finally like dull red spear-heads among the glowing\r\nembers.\r\n\r\nAt some fancied sound he turned sharply about, to peer through the\r\ndarkness of the trail.  All appeared as silent and calm as the grave.\r\nHe wondered if, perhaps, Elaine had arisen to come to her door.\r\n\r\nShe was not to be seen at the indistinct entrance of her cave.  He\r\nturned once more to stir his fire--then wheeled like one on a pivot.\r\n\r\nHis senses had not been deceived.  Beyond, in the darkness, a few feet\r\nonly from the cavern occupied by Elaine, two blazing coals had been\r\nfixed like twin stars by his movement.\r\n\r\nA sudden recollection that he had failed to close the gap in the wall\r\nswept hotly and accusingly through him.  Some beast of the jungle had\r\npassed the barrier, perhaps to enter the very cave that the wall had\r\nbeen built to protect!\r\n\r\nWith a note that broke the stillness abruptly, Grenville caught up a\r\nflaming branch of wood from the mass of embers in the fire, and sprang\r\nto the path to the cavern.\r\n\r\nThe prowling animal stood for a moment undecided, then started as if to\r\nspring before the oncoming man to the shelter of Elaine's rock retreat,\r\ndoubtless to turn there in desperation for a mad encounter in the dark.\r\n\r\nBut, perhaps by a yard, the man was there before him.  The brute, even\r\nthen, refused to retreat towards the trail by which it had come.  It\r\nleaped towards the place where Grenville made his bed--a shadowy form\r\nthat he knew at last was not the arrogant tiger.\r\n\r\nIt turned for a moment in the mouth of the cave, as if aware this\r\nsmaller retreat was too shallow for adequate shelter.  But before the\r\nman could crack his fiery brand upon the creature's head, it leaped\r\nwildly past him, growling a savage protest, and reluctantly retreated\r\ntowards the trail.\r\n\r\nOne more attempt it made, even then, to escape by Grenville's active\r\nform, and regain the larger cavern.  But his fierce, hot rushes were\r\nnot to be withstood.  It finally turned with another sort of bellow,\r\nand cowered uncertainly upon the downward path.\r\n\r\nAfter it no less desperately than before, Sidney plunged along the\r\nsteep descent, his firebrand brightly glowing in the wind.  A whine of\r\nfear escaped the jungle creature as he slunk at last through\r\nGrenville's gate to the outer precincts of the wall.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately followed a frightful din of growls and wauling.\r\nThere were certain deep gutturals and mouthings that Grenville was sure\r\nhis tiger only could produce.  There were sounds of a conflict, fierce\r\nand bloody, retreating down the trail.  Like a battle of cats,\r\nenormously exaggerated, with screams and roars intermingled, the\r\ndisturbance rose on the air.  But Grenville had blocked his gate with\r\nlogs and bowlders, and calmly returned to his place.\r\n\r\nElaine was crouching by the fire when he came once more to the terrace.\r\nShe had called him in vain, and was visibly trembling as his form\r\nappeared within the glow.\r\n\r\n\"What was it?\" she cried.  \"What has happened?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--it sounds like a couple of jungle politicians engaged in a tariff\r\nargument.\"\r\n\r\n\"You weren't down there?\"\r\n\r\n\"I strolled to the wall, to make sure it was closed for the night.\"\r\n\r\n\"There was nothing--up here?  I dreamed there was something--fighting\r\nwith you--some terrible creature--like that.\"\r\n\r\nShe waved her hand towards the hideous sounds, retreating swiftly in\r\nthe darkness.\r\n\r\n\"Can't understand such a dream,\" he said.  \"We've had no corned beef\r\nand cabbage.  You'd better go back and try again.\"\r\n\r\nHe started at once for his pottery fire, in his brusque, indifferent\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nElaine stood there, watching his figure, retreating in the darkness,\r\nand made no move to retire.  Like a dim silhouette of Vulcan, projected\r\nagainst the reddened glare of his furnace, he presently appeared, from\r\nthe place where she eagerly kept him in her vision.  She felt she could\r\nnot bear to creep away until he should return.\r\n\r\nShe saw him stand for a little time observing his waning heaps of\r\nembers before he faced about to return once more to his seat.  Then,\r\nslowly, as she heard his footsteps approaching, she glided silently\r\nback to her shelter, and so at length within the door.  Even then she\r\nlingered eagerly, to make certain he was not far away.  Until he sat\r\ndown, and stirred up the flames, she did not return to her couch.\r\n\r\n\"To be so perfectly fearless!\" she murmured, half aloud, and so crept\r\naway to her dark, uncomfortable cave.\r\n\r\nGrenville pocketed the documents, still lying face up on his rock.  He\r\nfinally slept beside the fire, to finish his plans in dreams.\r\n\r\nThese plans, which were vague enough that night, matured fairly early\r\nin the morning.  He had resolved to try for the tiger at the spring.\r\n\r\nFully expecting to encounter abundant signs of the animal conflict of\r\nthe midnight hours, he descended the trail before Elaine had appeared,\r\nintent upon removing such evidence of trouble as might be found\r\ndisturbingly near their tower.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing at all along the trail to show that a fight had taken\r\nplace.  Where the grass and shrubbery began in the clearing below the\r\nwalls, there was one mere tuft of hair upon a twig.  But a rod removed\r\nfrom this there was at least a hint as to what might have caused the\r\nengagement.\r\n\r\nThis was a trampled and slightly reddened ring where something had been\r\neaten--some quarry doubtless captured by the smaller of the prowlers,\r\nwho had found himself suddenly attacked and driven from the feast by\r\nthe master hunter of the jungle, on whose sacred preserves he had\r\nprobably dared to poach.\r\n\r\nGrenville proceeded to the spring, not only to fetch a fresh supply of\r\nwater, but as well to indulge in a vigorous washing of his hands and\r\nface, and to make some observations.\r\n\r\nHe found that by breaking several limbs a none too comfortable seat in\r\nthe branches of a rubber tree might be prepared, provided he could\r\nclimb to the perch.  With a very long fuse attached to his bomb he\r\nmight be enabled to execute a coup upon the tiger, under cover of the\r\nnight.  Could he only slay some animal--another wild hog, for\r\ninstance--and place it here as a lure, his chances of securing the\r\ntiger's attendance would be infinitely increased.\r\n\r\nA number of things were essential to his plan.  The first, a rope\r\nladder, was the simplest of the lot.  That he could fashion with ease.\r\nHis greatest problem was the fire with which to ignite his fuse, should\r\nhe wish to explode his bomb.  The wood he had found, that so amazingly\r\nretained its glow, might answer his needs for, perhaps, two hours, as\r\nhe sat high up in the tree.  It was all he possessed, and upon it he\r\nmust needs rely.  But how he should manage to discern his beast, in the\r\ndarkness, when the prowler came at last to drink, was more than he\r\ncould determine.\r\n\r\n\"A dead-fall might do for the brute,\" he soliloquized aloud, as the\r\nbusiness revolved in his mind.  \"But I couldn't get one ready by\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\nFor several reasons a dead-fall was impracticable.  The thought was,\r\ntherefore, abandoned, while the details of loading and placing the bomb\r\nwere elaborately planned.  So vivid was Grenville's imagination that\r\nalready he pictured himself high in the tree, heard the tiger come to\r\nlap the water, lighted his fuse--and ended that trouble forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTRUANTS OUT OF SCHOOL\r\n\r\nHe returned to the terrace, lightly whistling.  The morning was\r\nperfect, a delightfully refreshing zephyr lightly stirring in the\r\ntrees.  Elaine beheld him approaching, and nodded from the cliff.\r\n\r\n\"The jugs look beautiful!\" she called, enthusiastically.  \"The fire is\r\nbarely warm.\"\r\n\r\nHe had brought their supply of water in the sea-shell, so variously\r\nemployed.  Before providing fruits for their breakfast, he went to his\r\nfurnace with Elaine.  The firing was complete, though the vessels were\r\nnot yet cool.  A few were cracked, slightly, despite the care that\r\nGrenville had exercised, and one was hopelessly ruined.  However, he\r\nfelt the product as a whole was surprisingly satisfactory, especially\r\nsome of his molds and the crucibles meant for his foundry.\r\n\r\n\"At noon we'll fill a jug with water,\" he said, \"and you'll find it\r\nwill keep surprisingly cool.  The clay is slightly porous.  The water\r\noozes through, evaporates on the surface, and thereby chills the\r\ncontents.  They use nothing else in Egypt, and, I think, in Mexico.\r\n\r\n\"If it weren't for the tiger,\" said Elaine, \"I could often go to the\r\nspring.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right ho!\" said Grenville, cheerily, believing he understood a wish\r\nthat lay beneath her speech.  \"That reminds me.  I believe I could\r\nmanage to deepen a basin I saw in the rock on our lowermost shelf above\r\nthe sea, back yonder, and easily fill it by dipping salt water with a\r\njug on the end of a rope.  Any nymph should enjoy such a pool.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Elaine, delighted by the thought; \"do you really think you\r\ncould make it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--I've thought of it, you see, on an empty stomach.  After\r\nbreakfast----  There's quite a bit to do, by the way, after breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nWith the fruits now presently gathered, he brought a fresh supply of\r\ncreepers and leaves of the sisal, for labors soon to begin.  And while\r\nElaine prepared what was left of the meat, and the other things\r\nafforded by their larder, he went to the shelf of rock so completely\r\nprotected by its wall, and made up his mind that, with one good tool,\r\nplus a hammer, he could hew out a bath with amazingly little trouble.\r\n\r\n\"Meant to go fishing this morning!\" he confessed, as the sight of the\r\nclear, limpid tide below aroused new desires in his being.  \"There must\r\nbe oysters and many good fish, if I had the time to get them.\"\r\n\r\nFish-lines and other \"diversions\" were again postponed when the\r\nbreakfast was concluded, while Grenville braided fibers and tied stout\r\nrungs along their length, to form a rude sort of ladder.  This he\r\ncarried to the spring at length, and hung across the limb of his tree\r\nby lifting its end on a pole.\r\n\r\nOnce in the tree, he labored diligently, breaking or cutting away a\r\nnumber of interfering branches, and arranging a makeshift for a seat,\r\non which to rest as he waited.  The bomb would be better prepared in\r\nthe afternoon.\r\n\r\nOn his way, returning to the camp, he gathered a bundle of the special\r\nwood that he used to retain his fire.  It was while he was thus\r\nengaged, in an unexplored part of the thicket, that he came upon a\r\nfallen tree, fairly brittle with resin.  He snapped off branch after\r\nbranch of this, till his load was too heavy to carry.  With all he\r\ncould take he climbed the trail.\r\n\r\nA piece that he tried at the embers of his fire blazed promptly enough,\r\nproducing a volume of thick, black smoke, and a flame that burned\r\nslowly down the wood, as he held the lighted end aloft.\r\n\r\n\"If we happen to need a torch,\" he said to Elaine, who, as usual, was\r\nwatching results, \"this will always be stored here, ready.\"  He placed\r\nthe fagots in a near-by hollow of the rocks, against possible future\r\nneed.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing further to be done at the spring until the hour of\r\nsunset.  The jugs and vessels from the furnace were found to be\r\nsufficiently cool for handling, and were brought to the rear of his\r\nshelter.\r\n\r\nThe molds he had made excited anew his various ambitions.\r\n\r\n\"To-morrow I shall start operations on the smelter,\" he told his\r\ncompanion.  \"No tools means no boat--and no boat means no escape.\"\r\n\r\nElaine felt a bound of excitement in her veins at the mere suggestion\r\nof escape.  She inquired: \"How long will it take to build your boat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Can't tell,\" said Grenville, briefly.  \"Never built one on a toolless\r\nisland before.\"\r\n\r\n\"I only meant about how long,\" Elaine explained.  \"It will take at\r\nleast a week, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"More likely two,\" he answered, as before.  \"Meantime I'm going\r\nfishing.  Want to come?\"\r\n\r\nElaine had little liking for any such off-hand invitation.\r\n\r\n\"Not at present, thank you.\"  She turned away from him, coldly.\r\n\r\n\"It's an art and a sport you ought to cultivate,\" he informed her,\r\ncheerfully.  \"Might sometime keep you from starving.\"  He gathered up\r\nthe necessary paraphernalia, adding, \"I hope the fish will bite,\" and\r\nstarted on his way.\r\n\r\nHe had fully two hundred feet of the line he had braided from fibers.\r\nIt was thoroughly \"waxed\" with juices from the rubber tree, and\r\nalthough it was frequently knotted along its length, it was strong as a\r\nwire, and not inclined to kink.\r\n\r\nHis wooden hook was clumsy, but tough as steel, while its point and its\r\nbarb were exceedingly sharp.  Also, the bait he thrust upon it\r\nconcealed it well, except where the line was stoutly attached.  With\r\none of his old rusted hinges for a sinker, it was presently ready for\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nHe had chosen that protected shelf of rock whereon he meant to hew out\r\na bath for Elaine, since this was the nearest possible approach he\r\ncould make to the water from the cliff.  There, alas! at the very first\r\ncast attempted, his line was atrociously tangled, while the hook\r\nremained suspended some ten feet up from the tide.\r\n\r\nIn patience he sat himself down on the ledge to restore the line to\r\norder.  Elaine, who had doubtless pondered wisely on his observation,\r\nanent fishing as an art to be acquired, came half reluctantly wandering\r\nover to his side, while Grenville was still engrossed with his mess of\r\ntangles.  She watched him in silence for a time, then, finally, sank to\r\nthe bench of rock and began to lend her assistance.  He made not the\r\nslightest comment, and even failed to thank her when the task was\r\nfinally concluded.\r\n\r\nOnce again, at last, he swung the line for a cast far out in the\r\nwaters.  It seemed to Elaine the hook and sinker would never cease\r\nsailing outward.  Yet they fell and sank, much closer in than even\r\nGrenville had expected.\r\n\r\nHe began to pull it back at once, since there might be rocks on which\r\nthe hook would foul, and his labor be wholly lost.  The sinker, and\r\nthen the bait, emerged from the crystal depths of brine without so much\r\nas a nibble.  Again Grenville sent them full length out, and again drew\r\nin with no results, save a possible inquiry, far below, where he\r\nfancied he saw a gleam of silver.\r\n\r\nThe third cast fared no better than the others.  But the fourth was no\r\nmore than started homeward when a sharp, heavy strike was briskly\r\nreported on the line, and Grenville's jerk responded.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! you've got one!--you've got one!\" cried Elaine, with all the true\r\npleasure of a sportsman.  \"Please, please don't let it get away!\"\r\n\r\nGrenville was taking no chances on slack in the line, with his simple\r\nwooden hook.  He hauled in, hand over fist, while his catch fought\r\nmadly to escape.  With a wild inward dash and a mighty flop, the\r\nsilvery captive on the barb leaped entirely out of the water.\r\n\r\nGrenville's answering maneuver with the line, snatching up fully a yard\r\nof its length, and instantly stooping to clutch it low again, was all\r\nthat saved the situation.  His fish barely touched the surface, after\r\nthat, then was swiftly sailing up in air.\r\n\r\nHe was a beautiful specimen of his kind, but the species was new to his\r\ncaptor.\r\n\r\n\"What's the use of going to school?\" was Grenville's query, his eyes as\r\nbright as a boy's.  \"The next one may be a whale.\"\r\n\r\nThe next one, however, was a long time coming.  When it was hooked, the\r\nwise fisherman knew it was small, and, most unexpectedly, he delivered\r\nthe line to Elaine.\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, give him the dickens!\" he instructed.  \"You want to make\r\nhim think he's struck by lightning.\"\r\n\r\nSurprised as she was, and unprepared for this particular favor, Elaine\r\ndid her best, and hauled in valiantly, but the captive got away.\r\n\r\nFive or six casts were made after that before the hook was once more\r\nnibbled.  Grenville was rather inclined to change for a spot more\r\npopular with the purple water's tribe.  Yet he made another of his\r\nlongest throws, and had drawn in much of the dripping line when a clean\r\nyoung tortoise so deeply swallowed the hook that he could not have spat\r\nit out to save him.\r\n\r\nThe fight he offered was tremendous.  He dived and skittered through\r\nthe crystal tides like some giant saucer of dynamics.  Whole lines of\r\nthe brightest silver bubbles arose as he visibly flapped about and\r\nscuttled towards the bottom.  The line raced wildly here and there,\r\ncutting the waves with the sound of something hot and sizzling.\r\n\r\nBut it held for a full half hour of fighting.  It was strong enough for\r\nthe weight of a man, as Grenville afterward declared.  It conquered the\r\ntortoise finally, and drew him up, but not before he had wearied the\r\nfisherman's muscles and greatly fatigued Elaine, who was panting with\r\nsheer excitement.\r\n\r\n\"There you are,\" said Grenville, boyishly exultant, \"he's wash basin,\r\ncomb, a few hairpins, and what-not, all in one, not to mention turtle\r\nsoup.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no more fishing done that afternoon, nor were knitting\r\nneedles carved.  What with his turtle, his fish, the digging of several\r\nyams, and the making of his bomb, Grenville was amply employed.\r\n\r\nElaine was at length made acquainted with his programme for the night.\r\nShe made no effort to dissuade him from his purpose, but excitement\r\nrose in her bosom.  She feared for what the tiger might by mischance\r\naccomplish, and, also, she felt that in some occult way her own fate\r\nand the animal's were alike, if not related--that if such a brute must\r\nhelplessly succumb to the man's superior prowess, there was no chance\r\nat all for anything as feeble as herself.\r\n\r\nA wild, unreasoning hope was in her breast that the tiger might escape,\r\nor die in some different manner--do something, almost anything, rather\r\nthan contribute one more testimony to Sidney Grenville's might.  She\r\ncould not wish the creature to live, nor yet to injure this bold,\r\naudacious man.  She only knew that some dread of the being who could\r\ndare engage or attack this savage monster of the jungle was once more\r\nassailing her quaking heart and stirring her nature to rebellion.\r\n\r\nIn a manner that was largely automatic, she assisted in providing an\r\nearly evening meal.  It was dusk, however, when Grenville was finally\r\nready to leave her on the hill.\r\n\r\nShe followed him down to the gate against the wall, in the way of a\r\nchild who fears long hours alone.\r\n\r\n\"Good-night,\" he said to her, cheerily.  \"If you hear my little\r\nimitation of Bunker Hill--you might drop one tear for the departed.\"\r\n\r\nHer dread of the night, and the outcome of his excursion, had suddenly\r\nincreased.  \"If you kill him,\" she said, \"you'll come home?\"\r\n\r\nHe nodded.  \"Tickled to death and bragging like a pirate.\"\r\n\r\nThen he placed the logs and rocks against the barrier, and once more\r\nbade her good-night.  She waited till his final footsteps died away in\r\nthe gloom, then hastened once more to the brink above for a final\r\nglimpse of his form.\r\n\r\nHe had passed, however, across the clearing, and not even the spark\r\nthat he bore to the gathering darkness threw her back a dull red ray.\r\n\r\nHe had lost little time after leaving the foot of the trail.  The\r\njungle was wrapped in somber shadows as he made his way to the spring.\r\n\r\nSome nimble little creature leaped lightly away when he came to the\r\nplace.  Otherwise there was not a sign or a sound to disturb the\r\nringing silence.  His bomb he placed beside the ebon water, where a\r\nledge of rock would throw its violence outward.  The fuse, which he\r\ncarefully uncoiled and laid upon the grass, was amply long to meet his\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\nAt length, with his fire-stick held between his teeth, he ascended the\r\nladder to his perch.  The end of the fuse he now brought to the limb,\r\nconveniently near for lighting.  Then he settled himself to wait.\r\n\r\nOnce he blew on the coal slowly eating his brand, to clean the\r\nincandescent cone.  Of a sudden, then, he heard the sound of something\r\ndirectly beneath him, rudely brushing the foliage aside.\r\n\r\nHis heart for a second stood still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nA NIGHT IN THE JUNGLE\r\n\r\nIt was not the tiger Grenville heard above the pounding of his heart.\r\n\r\nThe squealing of some little insignificant beast, apparently more in\r\nsport than apprehension, betrayed very soon the fact that no sinister\r\nvisitor was even prowling near.  So heavy a sound as the little brute\r\nhad made would doubtless be avoided when the master of the jungle\r\nshould arrive.\r\n\r\nAll the excitement unduly engendered in Grenville's system rapidly\r\nsubsided.  He listened as intently as before, and peered below in an\r\neffort to pierce the densest shadows, but could not detect the form or\r\nwhereabouts of his early visitor.  He doubted if this small creature\r\ndrank, since the pool of the spring was still quite clearly visible,\r\nlike a surface half of ebony and half of tarnished silver.\r\n\r\nAt length the absolute silence prevailed as it had before.  Save for\r\nthe lightest of zephyrs, that barely sufficed to fan the topmost\r\nfoliage, not even the slightest stir could be detected.  The darkness\r\nbelow became absolute, where shadows, tree-trunks, and thicket all\r\nblended into one.  A portion only of the pool was now discernible, and\r\nin this, clearly mirrored, were two bright stars, that burned dull gold\r\nin the ebon.\r\n\r\nGrenville sat back in his lumpy perch and blew, as before, on his coal.\r\nIts slender wreath of invisible smoke ascended pungently.  The hour was\r\nstill very early for nocturnal business to begin.  The tiger might not\r\ncome till midnight.  Sidney reflected that the brute would doubtless\r\neat before a drink would be desired.\r\n\r\nHe regretted, vainly, that no bait had finally been provided.  Even the\r\nfish they had only partially eaten for dinner might have been\r\nattractive to the tiger.  Any price now would be cheap enough to rid\r\nthemselves of this terror.\r\n\r\nHis reflections ran the gamut of their island world, and sped far over\r\nseas.  He thought of that day with Fenton, and of what this friend\r\nwould think.  Had they heard the news, in that far-away home, of the\r\nsteamer gone down with every soul?\r\n\r\nHe thought of the morning he had greeted Elaine--and the something that\r\nhad happened to his nature.  He remembered in detail every hour of\r\nevery day they had spent together on the steamer.  Then the hideous\r\ndetails of all that last experience, in the storm and night, paraded by\r\nfor his review.\r\n\r\nOne after another the swiftly moving procession of events brought him\r\nback to this present hour.  He was, then, confronted once again by the\r\nquestions--how long would it last?--how might it end?  The island's\r\nmystery impinged once more on his varied cogitations, making him wish\r\nhe might have had a torch, by which to study the documents reposing in\r\nhis pocket.\r\n\r\nMentally picturing forth the signs on the leathery piece of parchment,\r\nhe busied himself for above an hour for a clew as to what they could\r\nmean.  They suggested nothing to his mind that made the slightest\r\nsense.  He tried to recall the characters on the \"explanatory\" sheet.\r\nBut this was a hopeless task.\r\n\r\nAware of the value of deduction, he began on a reasoning line.\r\nAnything to occupy his thoughts and time till the hour when the tiger\r\nmight have fed, and would come for his evening drink, was highly\r\nwelcome.\r\n\r\nHe began by a natural presumption that both the documents, found\r\ntogether in the tube, and so carefully concealed, related to this\r\nparticular island.  Did they not, then of what possible value would be\r\ntheir final decipherment and solution?\r\n\r\nGranting this premise, then what should follow next?  Certainly some\r\nmention of the island--with its name--in the written message, at least.\r\nThere would naturally be, in these circumstances, some word in the\r\ncipher spelling \"Island\"--but what would the place be called?\r\n\r\nSuch places, he knew, were frequently named quite unofficially, by\r\nwandering sailors, adventurers, and drifters on the sea.  Attempting to\r\nlevel his state of mind to that of such human beings, he wondered what\r\nhe, if left to himself, would christen this bit of rock and jungle.\r\n\r\nSo often, he reflected, a place was named for its appearance.  This\r\none, for instance, might aptly be called \"Three Rocks,\" \"Three Walls,\"\r\nor \"Three Towers.\"  He remembered, finally, the abominable sounds\r\nproduced by the tides twice daily--sounds he had thought might have\r\nfrightened the natives away.  The cognomen, \"Haunted Island,\" might not\r\nseem wholly inappropriate to a superstitious mind.\r\n\r\nThe more he reflected, the more certain he felt that some one of the\r\nnames suggested to his mind might also have occurred to those of\r\nothers.  Considerably aroused in his centers of curiosity, and\r\nconvinced that even by the dull cherry glow of his firebrand he might\r\nbe enabled to confirm or confute his theory, he moved sufficiently to\r\ndraw from his pocket the closely folded documents, and held them up to\r\nhis torch.\r\n\r\nThe one with the inexplicable signs he promptly returned as of no\r\nimmediate avail.  At that instant his attention was arrested, by a\r\nsound below him on the earth.\r\n\r\nSomething, he thought, was lapping at the water!\r\n\r\nHe leaned far forward, tense and rigid on the limb, shielding his spark\r\nin one of his hands, while he peered about the pool.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing he could possibly discern--no form of a head\r\nprojected out to obliterate his stars.  Yet the sounds at the edge of\r\nthe silent basin rose distinctly to his ears.\r\n\r\nAll but ready to bend to the end of his fuse, and touch his fire upon\r\nit, he paused, looked closer, saw ripples move to disturb his mirrored\r\nplanets--and then beheld some form darkly limned on the waters.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he was certain his insolent tiger was there.  Some huge\r\nblunt muzzle seemed inkily contrasted with the dull gray surface of the\r\nspring.  Then the muzzle suddenly detached itself from the imagined\r\nform behind.  The entire figure of some little beast was seen as it\r\nwaded the pool.\r\n\r\nOnce more, disgustedly, Grenville reclined and relaxed the strain on\r\nhis nerves.  It was some time, then, before he thought to return to his\r\nquest of the cipher.  He remembered, finally, he had meant to count the\r\ncharacters in some of the words to see if the number of signs thus used\r\nmight not correspond with the number employed in \"Island,\" \"Three,\"\r\n\"Haunted,\" \"Wall,\" or \"Tower.\"\r\n\r\nA dull red glow, of most unsatisfactory dimensions and illuminative\r\ncapacity, was the most he could procure from his brand.  It barely\r\nsufficed to present the \"writing\" to his vision.  For a moment, indeed,\r\nhe despaired of discriminating clearly between the ending of one word\r\nand the beginning of the next.  Fortunately, however, the writer had\r\nused large periods between his every word.\r\n\r\nConsiderably to Grenville's satisfaction, the third word thus denoted\r\nhe was almost convinced was \"Three.\"  Not only had it the proper number\r\nof letters, or signs, but the two final characters were exactly alike,\r\nand both were the crosses he had previously selected as probably\r\nrepresenting E.\r\n\r\nThe next word along, he was equally certain, was either \"Wall\" or\r\n\"Hill.\"  Its two final characters were the same particular sign\r\nrepeated, while its meaning, in conjunction with the preceding word\r\n\"Three,\" fulfilled his logical deduction.\r\n\r\nA word of two characters followed this, and then, to Grenville's\r\nintense delight, occurred a word of seven letters, which not only met\r\nthe numerical requirements of \"Haunted,\" but, also, in proper sequence,\r\nemployed the various letter-signs already somewhat proved by the word\r\nhe felt certain was \"Three.\"\r\n\r\nThis was more than sufficient evidence on which to base a test of the\r\nmessage's sense, if it were not, indeed, enough of a key with which to\r\ndecipher the entire inscription.\r\n\r\nEagerly fumbling in his pocket for his pencil, with the intention of\r\nattempting a bit of substitution of letters for the signs contained\r\nupon the sheet, Grenville shifted his position--and the paper fell from\r\nhis fingers, fluttering obliquely from his sight.\r\n\r\nHe leaned quickly forward, as if to follow the flight of the missive\r\nthrough the darkness so densely spread beneath him.  But it disappeared\r\nalmost instantly--with its mystery still unsolved.\r\n\r\nOn the point of descending, at whatever cost, to recover the important\r\nbit of foolscap, Sidney was halted in movement and impulse by some new\r\narrival at the spring.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, two animals were there, as he presently\r\ndiscovered.  That neither was his tiger he was presently persuaded, but\r\nthat one or both were fairly large seemed equally assured.\r\n\r\nIt was certainly not a time to leave the tree.  And while the\r\nreflection that, perhaps, the silent visitors were leopards was\r\npresented to Grenville's mind, and a momentary thought of slaying the\r\npair by igniting his fuse became a strong temptation, he contented\r\nhimself by staring more or less blindly down upon the place where they\r\nseemed to be, and bided his time as before.\r\n\r\nAt nine o'clock it seemed, to the cramped and impatient hunter in the\r\ntree, that ages had passed since he bade good-night to Elaine and came\r\nto this lonely vigil.  There were sounds in abundance about him now,\r\narising from time to time.  Some were the cries of the lesser beasts,\r\nin the clutches or jaws of their captors; some were sounds of munching.\r\nAll of them indicated rather grimly the tiger's absence from the scene.\r\nThere would be no petty murderers thereabout when the arch brute came\r\nfor his drink.\r\n\r\nLeaning back once more, and long since weary of his fruitless\r\nadventure, Grenville stared at the glowing cone of fire slowly eating\r\naway his brand.  It was lasting far longer than he had believed would\r\nbe possible--yet certainly less than one hour more could the consuming\r\nsubstance serve to give him a spark.\r\n\r\nHe could almost fancy he saw a face, in the film of ash upon its\r\nsurface.  He was sure the face was developing a likeness to Elaine.\r\nEven the soft clear radiance of her cheek----  How eagerly she had\r\nasked concerning his coming \"home\"--but how far it seemed away....  He\r\ncould hear her saying \"You'll come home ... come home ... come back....\"\r\n\r\nHe awoke with a start, for something had burned him on the wrist.\r\n\r\nThe firebrand, all but consumed in his relaxing fingers, had dropped\r\nand deposited a blister.  In his sudden move to rid himself of the\r\ntorture to his flesh, he threw off the red-hot candle of wood, and it\r\nfell straight downward, sizzling once where it struck in a trickle of\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nReviling himself for a stupid blunderer, and arousing vividly to a\r\nsense of where he was, and why, he began to question the expediency of\r\nreturning at once to the terrace.  He was still debating the wisdom of\r\nthe move, when the question was decided by the tiger.\r\n\r\nThat belated midnight reveler--the old roué of the jungle--was ushered\r\nin with questionable pomp--the panic of lesser brutes in flight.  And\r\nwhen he drank, beside the useless bomb, there was no mistaking his\r\npresence.  He presently paused, half satisfied, and lifted his head,\r\nagainst the shudder of the water, to sniff at the jungle breeze.\r\n\r\nThe wind had betrayed the presence of the man, and the great brute\r\nvoiced his satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nA DEAD MAN'S SECRET\r\n\r\nThat was a long, weird night in the jungle.\r\n\r\nWhat hour it was the tiger finally departed was more than Grenville\r\ncould have told.  And whether the daylight, finally approaching, or a\r\nroyal disgust, or some easily captured morsel, had served to urge the\r\nbrute upon his way, was equally unknown.\r\n\r\nGrenville descended from his perch at last, when the palms and ferns\r\nhad darkly emerged from the velvety blackness of the thicket.  He took\r\nup his club, left the bomb in its place, and, searching about,\r\nrecovered the sheet of parchment dropped in the darkness.  Aware that\r\nthe silently moving enemy might still be lurking by the pathway, he\r\nmade his way no less boldly from the shadows, and came duly to the hill.\r\n\r\nHis chagrin was complete when he told Elaine that his night had been\r\nspent in vain.  She had scarcely slept, as he could see, for her face\r\nwas still pale with worry, while her eyes showed her lack of rest.\r\n\r\n\"I shall try again to-night,\" he said, but from that he was dissuaded.\r\n\r\nThe strain was too great upon Elaine, if not upon himself.  He\r\npresently promised to wait a day, and see what might develop.  He could\r\nnot subject his companion to another such session of agonizing worry as\r\nElaine had undergone until he felt more certain of results.\r\n\r\nBut to wait a day in idleness, while he felt that every hour that\r\npassed might bring new dangers upon them, could scarcely accord with\r\nhis intentions.\r\n\r\nHe declared the tiger an arrant coward, who dared not confront him in\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\n\"We have faced far greater perils than this,\" he told her, as they ate\r\ntheir simple breakfast, \"and we may be called upon to face the like\r\nagain.  We're enormously fortunate to have nothing more than this\r\nstriped beast to limit our freedom on the island.\"\r\n\r\nElaine could have thought of countless other animals, including snakes,\r\nthat would amply curtail her roaming inclinations, but she was not in\r\nthe least in the habit of rehearsing her many dreads.\r\n\r\nGrenville went promptly to work, after breakfast, fetching clay in the\r\nbasket from the pit.  It was not brought up to the terrace, but dumped\r\nin a heap beside the hollow tree, in the burned space under the walls.\r\nThis tree, he at last explained to Elaine, he intended to use as a\r\nsmelter.\r\n\r\n\"It's a natural chimney I've annexed,\" was the way he presented the\r\nproblem.  \"If I built a fire in it now, however, it would burn, and be\r\ndestroyed.  I intend to line it with clay--plaster it on, inside, some\r\neight or ten feet high.  Then when this fire-resisting substance dries,\r\nI can smelt my metal and run it in the molds.  The draught will make a\r\nprodigious heat--far more than brass requires.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" said Elaine.  \"Meantime I am utterly idle.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll cut you those needles.  You can knit,\" he said, \"unless you\r\nprefer to go fishing.\"\r\n\r\nHe had come to the camp for one of the jugs in which to carry water for\r\nthe clay.  This task was temporarily abandoned while he sat in the\r\nshade, beside Elaine, and carved out the promised tools.  These were\r\nmade of wood, instead of bone, since the latter material was far too\r\nhard for his fragment of a blade, and one of the woods provided by the\r\njungle was so straightly grained and elastic, that even a slender\r\nsplinter would bend like steel before it broke.\r\n\r\nFor a short time after they were finished, he sat there to watch the\r\ncraft displayed by Elaine's nimble fingers, as a slender bit of the\r\nfiber stuff began to accumulate in stitches.\r\n\r\n\"You were made for a home-builder's mate,\" he said, and arose and left\r\nher to her thoughts, and to certain inflammable emotions.\r\n\r\nHe carried his jug down the trail and to the spring, resuming the\r\nbusiness in hand.  The sight of the pool not only served to arouse his\r\ndisgust anew, but he was likewise reminded of the documents, reposing\r\nstill unread in his pocket.  The bomb, he knew, should be carried back\r\nto camp, lest the fuse become dampened in the thicket.  With this and\r\nhis jug full of water, he hastened back to the foot of the trail--and\r\nforgot them both forthwith.\r\n\r\nThe half sheet of paper, readable at last, had enslaved him then and\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nHe sat on a rock, with the paper on his knee, and was lost to all\r\nthings else.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he thought, perhaps, he had dreamed of obtaining the key\r\nto the hidden message.  But one hurried glance at the words he had read\r\nconvinced him the trick had been done.\r\n\r\nOn the back of the sheet he began at once to jot down the signs of\r\nwhich he felt most certain.  The results, as he made them, were these:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE, HILL, HAUNTED, and their symbols]\r\n\r\nThe next word, according to his deductions, should be \"Island.\"  This,\r\nhe felt, was indisputably confirmed by the fact it contained precisely\r\nthe required number of \"letters,\" with the sign for L, A, and D,\r\nalready discovered, occupying their proper positions.  He, therefore,\r\nadded:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"ISLAND\" and its symbols]\r\n\r\nto his growing collection of letters, and promptly produced the\r\nfollowing results by the process of substitution:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: many words, and their symbols]\r\n\r\nThere could be so little doubt, after that, concerning such words as\r\n\"Under,\" \"High,\" \"Important,\" and \"Water,\" which supplied the\r\ncharacters, U, G, M, P, W, and O, which was also suggested in \"Or,\"\r\nbefore \"Haunted,\" that a bit of additional substitution very promptly\r\ncleared the entire affair.\r\n\r\nGrenville jotted it down, to make sense, in the following fashion:\r\n\r\n\"Under tree, Three-Hill, or Haunted Island, Cave.  Get in (during) high\r\nwater (in) Spring time when noise loud.  Important.  Make no mistake.\r\nMap on Buli shows same.\"\r\n\r\nThe one word which he felt to be doubtful was \"Buli,\" which, he\r\nconfessed, might as readily be \"Zuli,\" \"Juli,\" or \"Quli,\" but this was\r\nof no significance, one way or another.  Its meaning was still obscure.\r\n\r\nThere were several things in the message or statement, however, that\r\nconfirmed his earlier uneasiness.  The principal of these was the\r\nstatement that it was important for the possible seekers of some cavern\r\nunder the greater wall of rock to visit the island only during the time\r\nwhen the hideously haunting sounds were at their height.  This argued,\r\nhe thought, that the sounds would finally subside, or altogether cease,\r\nwhen complications--doubtless in the form of visitors--might be\r\nexpected to develop.\r\n\r\nThat the visitors would be natives and, probably, Dyaks, Grenville\r\ncould have no doubt.  As to what there was in the cave beneath the\r\nrock, he had small curiosity only, since it was hardly likely such\r\ntools as he desired would be so concealed from a prying world, and\r\ntools alone had value for him now.\r\n\r\nHe could not doubt, however, that something there was in the cave here\r\ndescribed, for which men had risked their lives.  He thought of the\r\nheadless skeletons, and then of the mummy in chains.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, at thought of that guardian of the barque, his heart gave an\r\nadded leap.  He snatched from his pocket the parchment referred to as a\r\nmap.  He could instantly see, by the light of day, that the leathery\r\nsubstance was leather, indeed, of the most grewsomely repellent\r\ndescription!  It was simply _tanned human skin_!\r\n\r\nAnd abruptly he understood that phrase--\"Map on Buli shows same.\"  The\r\npyramids represented the island's three great hills, and other signs\r\nthe cave.  The pole with a knob, on the tallest hill, was the tree so\r\nnear his camp.\r\n\r\nAye, the thing was a map in very truth--and once it had been ON Buli!\r\nFor Buli was he who sat in the barque, chained fast to prevent his\r\nescape!\r\n\r\n_This map he had borne, tattooed on his breast, from which it had\r\nfinally been stripped!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nFEVERISH EMPLOYMENTS HALTED\r\n\r\nA species of horror attacked the man on whom the truth had flashed.\r\nWhat abominable cruelties and crimes lay back of the business thus\r\nfinally to some extent revealed, he could only faintly imagine.\r\n\r\nHe felt quite certain of one or two things, that were not to be told to\r\nElaine.  First, he could not for a moment doubt that the barque had\r\nbeen brought to the island with the sole intent and purpose of looting\r\nthe cave of treasure.  He was equally convinced its crew had been\r\nfoully slaughtered--and their heads removed.  This smacked of Dyak\r\natrocities.  Finally, there was ample evidence that men of some sort\r\nhad visited the island long since the wreck was stranded, and probably\r\nwithin the year.\r\n\r\nHe had not required the warning made \"important\" on the sheet to urge\r\nhim to haste in preparing a boat with which to attempt an escape.  To\r\nlearn that the haunting sounds of the tide would at length subside was\r\na new and disquieting addition to what he had previously deduced.  He\r\nhad accurately hit upon the natives' superstitious awe of the sounds to\r\naccount for the island's desertion.\r\n\r\nHow long these invaluable shrieks and moans might be counted upon to\r\ncontinue became a vital question.  Could they only last till a boat\r\ncould be completed, launched, provisioned, and directed away to a safer\r\nretreat, he would ask for nothing more.\r\n\r\nHe returned again to an inspection of the \"map\"--now singularly plain.\r\nThe island was graphically represented by the three conventional\r\n\"hills,\" with the sign for water inscribed at either end.  The tree, so\r\nconspicuous upon the tallest wall of rock, was no less vividly\r\nportrayed.\r\n\r\nBelow this identifying picture of the place the hill with the tree was\r\nrepeated, with the cave and design for water, while just to the right\r\nthe detail of the cavern, with more water signs, indicating both high\r\nand low tide, was depicted somewhat enlarged.  The cartouch was not so\r\nreadily comprehended.  Grenville was inclined to believe it spelled\r\nsome crude king's name, while the scarab, or beetle, was, of course, an\r\nold Egyptian symbol concerned with life and death.\r\n\r\nIt would hardly have been human of Grenville not to wonder about the\r\ncave or to contemplate a visit there--just to have the merest look\r\nabout the place.  He even went so far as to wonder if its entrance\r\nmight not be effected from the upper brink, by means of a longer rope\r\nladder than the one he had already made.\r\n\r\nHe did not, however, seriously contemplate delaying affairs more\r\nimportant to gratify this whim.  Indeed, he was fired with new\r\nimpatience to work night and day against the hour of escape.  The\r\nthought put him back on his feet, then and there, with the documents\r\nstored away.  There was no time to lose--not a moment--not even to fool\r\nwith the tiger!\r\n\r\nHe left his bomb and its fuse upon the rocks, and carried the water to\r\nhis clay.  To line his hollow-tree furnace as promptly as possible must\r\nbe his first concern.  No boat could be made without suitable tools,\r\nand----  He wondered how he should make it, even then.\r\n\r\nThe log he had found on the day they arrived was such a huge affair to\r\nattack with the implements his limited craft made possible, despite all\r\nthe bronze he could melt.  And yet, without it, he was helpless.  The\r\nraft was far too clumsy for propulsion.  It afforded practically\r\nnothing transformable into a boat, as he had no nails, no saw, no\r\nanything with which it might be first dismembered, and finally\r\nreconstructed.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove!\" he exclaimed to himself, aloud, as a new thought crept\r\nsubtly to his brain.  \"I can hollow the log with fire!\"\r\n\r\nHe went at once to the straight and ample tree-trunk, lying propped\r\nupon a rock.  Its ends had already been partially consumed, and thereby\r\nrounded, in the flames that had ravaged the place.  How he could cover\r\nsuch parts as he must not burn with a plaster of his clay, Grenville\r\ninstantly conceived.  And there was the log already lifted away from\r\nthe earth, for the fire to be kindled beneath!\r\n\r\nThe wisdom of starting this process at once, even before his tools were\r\nmade, was immediately apparent.  Back to his clay heap he hastened\r\neagerly, and, pawing it over to form a hollow pyramid, he poured in the\r\nwater to soak through the mass, and so make it soft enough to use.\r\n\r\nA new, unsparing spasm of labor seized the man in that hour, and he\r\nworked unremittingly.  He felt he had loafed away his time which\r\nimportant requirements demanded.\r\n\r\nThe task of digging the clay from the pit and fetching it up to his\r\nhollow tree in the basket, made of creepers, was interminable.  The\r\nsticks and wooden \"spades\" he had managed to fashion, not only broke\r\nfrom over-use and straining, but they were dull and heavy and awkward.\r\nThe basket was scarcely more convenient than the implements in\r\nfulfilling its simple function.  He could manage to carry its weight\r\nupon his head, but at this he had meager skill.\r\n\r\nFor three days he worked to get the clay, or to work it up and apply it\r\nwith his hands.  A considerable portion of the fallen log was thus\r\nquite promptly covered.  He had then to wait for the clay to dry before\r\nhis fire could be ignited.\r\n\r\nThe supply of clay he had managed to amass was clearly insufficient.\r\nHe paused, on one of those warm and breathless afternoons, to set a\r\nnumber of traps in the animal pathways, and construct an awning for\r\nElaine.  This was merely a structure before her cave, to support a roof\r\nof leaves and grasses.  It afforded a shade, however, that was\r\nexceedingly grateful.\r\n\r\nThere were numerous interruptions, also, for procuring meat and fruits.\r\nGrenville had brought down a pheasant with the last of his two\r\nremaining arrows.  And not even a quill, supplied by the wings, had\r\nblown away from his \"store.\"  He had cut new shafts by his evening\r\nfire, and tipped them with points of sharpened wood.  Elaine had\r\nfeathered them skillfully, after once being properly directed.\r\n\r\nNot a sign, all this time, had Grenville seen of the tiger, still\r\nhaunting the jungle.  He had been too industriously engrossed, either\r\nto wonder or to care where the brute had recently been lurking.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth warm morning of his toil about the furnace, the reminder\r\ncame home with a jolt.  Some few yards away from the clay pit's edge\r\nlay the master murderer's kill.  It was part of a freshly eaten boar.\r\n\r\nGrenville was neither revolted nor angered by the sight.  He was\r\nsuddenly excited with a new hope of getting a certain robe to lay at\r\nthe feet of Elaine.  It never occurred to his eager mind that the brute\r\nwho bore it might be lying near, in a mood to resent his intrusion\r\nhere, where the kingly banquet had been left for a sitting again that\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nHis first concern was to keep away, as far as possible, lest the smell\r\nof his boots offend the lordly brute when he finally returned.\r\nMeantime such preparations as the scene made possible must not be\r\nunduly delayed.\r\n\r\nThe trees above the reddened spot afforded more choice for his\r\nnecessary perch than he had found on the previous occasion.  He rapidly\r\nsketched his plans for the night with mental notes and observations.\r\nWhere the bomb could lie, to prove most efficacious, and still at the\r\nsame time offer no great menace to himself, was readily determined.\r\nThe ladder required for ascending to his stand would better be hung on\r\nthe side most removed from the trail, for which he must a little clear\r\nthe thicket.\r\n\r\nHis club, without which the visit here at sunset was not to be\r\nundertaken, could lean on the tree-trunk while he sat above, since\r\nthere, should any need arise, he could find it in the dark.\r\n\r\nHe abandoned all thought of treading back and forth from the clay pit\r\nto his smelter, and carried his basket away.  The ladder he brought at\r\nonce from the spring, and, expending an hour in more careful\r\npreparation for his comfort than had even been possible before, he\r\nfinally departed from the site of the tiger's gory refreshment, well\r\nsatisfied with all he had been able to accomplish.\r\n\r\nHe returned to the camp, made a careful examination of the bomb and its\r\nfuse, and selected the wood to be finally used in preserving his\r\nessential spark of fire.  Then, willing at last to turn his attention\r\nagain to his daily occupation, he once more descended to his\r\nclay-covered log and found the plaster sufficiently dry upon it for the\r\nfirst of the burning to be started.  He called to Elaine, who threw him\r\ndown some glowing embers, from the fire always burning near his shelter.\r\n\r\nAll day he found abundant employment, working with flame and clay.  The\r\neating away of the log in a manner to leave a hollow shell, could not,\r\nhe found, be accomplished as swiftly as he had hoped.  Moreover, the\r\nfires required his constant attention, lest they burn too deeply to\r\nright or left, and thus destroy, or considerably impair, the walls he\r\ndesired to protect.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon he permitted this fire to die.  Until more clay could\r\nbe plastered about and the blackly charred portions of the wood removed\r\nwith a tool, the process must be halted.  He had still a small section\r\ninside his natural smelter to cover before he could undertake the\r\nmelting of his metal, but his heap of clay was gone.\r\n\r\nOnce more, as he had on the previous occasion, he informed Elaine in\r\nthe late afternoon of his intentions for the night.  Her look of alarm\r\nwas the only sign that escaped her resolute being.  She had silently\r\nnoted his earlier activity with the bomb and his fire-preserving wood;\r\nshe was not surprised by his plans.\r\n\r\n\"I shall not be down at the spring,\" he said, \"but over there nearer\r\nthe clay pit.  I have found a place where I rather expect our friend to\r\narrive at a decently early hour.\"\r\n\r\nHer eyes were startled and wide.\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean he sleeps where you have been walking every day?\"\r\n\r\n\"No--certainly not.  But I'm sure he was there last night--and I hope\r\nhe'll come again.\"\r\n\r\nShe was quick to divine the unpleasant truth that Grenville was\r\nstriving to avoid.\r\n\r\n\"You mean--he's been eating there--and left some awful----\"\r\n\r\n\"Good pork,\" he agreed, as he took up his bomb; \"a fine wild\r\nboar--enough to have done us for a week.\"\r\n\r\nShe resumed her work of knitting, on a small, round basket-like affair.\r\n\r\n\"I hope there are more of those hogs for him to get,\" she told him,\r\nquietly.  \"I hope they are easy prey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right ho!  But I trust he'll not be off with the old pig before he is\r\non with the new.  I want him to come to the party there to-night.\"\r\n\r\nElaine looked up for a moment, and thrilled to the look in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said, \"I suppose you do.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nAT THE TIGER'S KILL\r\n\r\nThe island twilight was brief.  When the sun departed from that speck\r\nof verdure in the purple sea, the covetous darkness seemed to form like\r\na presence that had crouched to bide its time.\r\n\r\nGrenville was early on the scene of the tiger's previous feast.  He had\r\nno idea how soon after sundown the jungle monarch might appear.  It was\r\nnot such a place as inspired hilarious joy in the heart, in any\r\ncircumstances.  Moreover, one last examination of the bomb and fuse,\r\nand one clear impression of the features beneath and about his tree,\r\nseemed to Sidney a wise precaution.\r\n\r\nThe day had, therefore, barely ended when he climbed aloft to his\r\nperch.  The end of the fuse was tied to a limb a little removed from\r\nhis feet.  He closed his eyes and found it with his hand, by way of\r\nmaking certain it should not be missed in the dark.  The larger and\r\ndenser of the forms below, created by shadows and growing plants, he\r\nnoted in their relation to the kill.  The latter was not to be clearly\r\nseen, since a screen of leaves he had purposely left to conceal his\r\npresence from the banqueter, served to shield it from his view.\r\n\r\nFinally, closing his eyes again, he practiced retreating behind the\r\ntrunk itself, as he knew he must do when nothing could be seen and his\r\nfuse was finally lighted.  This was rather a delicate operation to\r\nmanage in the dark.  He made up his mind it must be calmly done, for\r\nample time would be provided by the generous length of fuse.\r\n\r\nThis length, by the way, was considerably less than he had formerly\r\nemployed.  The bomb was, therefore, nearer to his stand.  Yet the bulk\r\nof the tree-trunk was, he thought, an entirely adequate protection\r\nshould he have the delight of hearing his powder explode.\r\n\r\nThrough the lattice of leaves he presently beheld the last of the day's\r\ndying splendor.  The army of shadows, already on the march, was taking\r\nrapid possession of all the jungle deeps.  The same impatience he had\r\nfelt before, the same vague dread and loneliness previously\r\nexperienced, and the same slow drag of time impressed themselves upon\r\nhis senses.\r\n\r\nHe wondered how long his brand would last, although it was longer than\r\nthe other.  He wondered about Elaine, on the hill, and how tedious the\r\nhours would seem to her.  But the constant, underlying worry was--when\r\nwould the tiger arrive?\r\n\r\nElaine's suggestion was a bother.  Might there not be hogs so\r\nplentiful, quarry so readily captured, that the overdisdainful monarch\r\nwould prefer warm meat to cold?\r\n\r\nThere was no mysterious cipher to be studied here to-night.  There was\r\nnothing, in fact, with which to pass the time.  Not even a new\r\nspeculation concerning the cave and the rotting barque arose to give\r\nhim entertainment.  The haunting, suggestive stillness engulfed him\r\nwhere he sat.  The world below had merged in one featureless gloom.\r\nExcept for a few fringed patches of sky between the leaves and\r\nbranches, there was nothing but velvety blackness to be seen above or\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\nHe waited and waited, a time that seemed eternal.  His resting-place\r\nwas hard and uneven.  One of his legs was cramped.  To shift about and\r\nmake no noise was not an easy matter.\r\n\r\nWithout the slightest warning, suddenly down below him something leaped\r\nand crashed through the thicket with a most unexpected sound.  Whatever\r\nit was, it went bounding off, recklessly parting the jungle.  Some\r\ncreature in fright it undoubtedly was--and Grenville was instantly\r\nrigid and alert for the next development.\r\n\r\nHe was certain the tiger, coming to his feast, had thrown some timid\r\ncreature into a panic of blind and desperate fear.  He listened, with\r\nall his powers of concentration, for the sounds that should presently\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\nBut save for another plunging, far beyond, there was absolute silence\r\nas before.  For fully half an hour after that the stillness was\r\nwell-nigh insupportable, so fraught was it all with the tragic sense of\r\nnoiseless life where both hunted and hunters moved about with the\r\ncushioned feet of shadows.\r\n\r\nFar off towards the spring, or the estuary, a disturbance finally\r\narose.  It was neither loud nor clear.  It seemed to interpret some\r\nstruggle for life, or pursuit of the weak by the strong.  It approached\r\nfor a time, then ceased for nearly half a minute, only to break into\r\nclearer accents of some brute's agony, poignant but mercifully brief.\r\n\r\nAt this the discouragement in Grenville's breast was unavoidably\r\nincreased.  He was certain the tiger had taken fresher prey, and would\r\nnow ignore his former kill.  So intent were his senses on that far-off\r\nbit of jungle drama that he failed to detect a nearer sound repeated\r\nbeneath his feet.\r\n\r\nWhen his sharp ears abruptly warned him that something was moving down\r\nbelow, an extraordinary climax to his adventure was swiftly coming to a\r\nfocus.\r\n\r\nSome creature had come to the tiger's kill--of that there could be no\r\ndoubt.  It was lapping, or chewing at the meat!\r\n\r\nUnable to distinguish the slightest thing in all that Stygian darkness,\r\nGrenville paused, with his brand slightly shielded from the creature's\r\npossible notice, waiting a moment to confirm the fact that a banqueter\r\nwas present before he touched the fuse.\r\n\r\nA tremendous roar instantly startled the silence, a few feet beyond the\r\nboar's remains.  Before the man could move a hand, either to light the\r\nready fuse or steady himself in the branches, some heavy form was\r\nhurled against the tree in which he sat--_and that something was\r\nclimbing madly upward_!\r\n\r\nOnly a tremor had shivered through the trunk, but the limbs were bent\r\nand the foliage stirred as if from a breath of heavy wind.  That the\r\ncreature might run against himself and turn to fight, in its double\r\nfear and desperation, Grenville was keenly aware.\r\n\r\nSubconsciously, also, he was equally sure the tiger was below.  The\r\ncatlike thing in the tree with himself had undoubtedly dared to sit\r\ndown at the huge brute's kill, to flee for its life a moment later.\r\n\r\nInstinctively turning to protect himself and thoroughly disturbed by\r\nthis unforeseen complication, Grenville heard his unwelcome companion\r\nutter one sudden whine, of surprise and added terror, as it came\r\nabreast him in the branches.\r\n\r\nIt dared not retreat, and, therefore in a wilder panic, clawed its way\r\nhigher up the tree.  The limbs continued to shake their leaves for\r\nanother protracted moment.  Then the beast found a place to halt above\r\nhis head, and doubtless glared down upon the unknown peril which man\r\nsupplies to all the brutes.\r\n\r\nGrenville recovered his wits as best he might.  He had no particular\r\ndread of the animal crouched somewhere in his neighborhood, but neither\r\ndid he relish its presence.  What effect the affair would have on the\r\ncreature he had come there to engage he could not, of course, determine.\r\n\r\nHe bent to listen for sounds from the space below.  Not the faintest\r\nsuggestion of a moving or feeding animal could his focused senses\r\ndetect.  He thought perhaps the tiger might have smelled him or seen\r\nhim in the tree.  It occurred to him, also, the brute might be waiting\r\nfor the catlike thief to descend and be slain at the kill.\r\n\r\nBut a far more likely supposition was that the tiger, having sniffed\r\nthe taint of some beast without caste, now left on the meat that was\r\nsacred to himself, had disdained to touch it, and had gone away, to\r\nreturn to the place no more.\r\n\r\nReady to curse the despicable animal now sharing the tree's security\r\nwith himself, Sidney was all but resigned to another long night, spent\r\nin vain and in utter discomfort, when once again a lapping sound came\r\ncrisply to his attention.\r\n\r\nHis brute was at the feast!\r\n\r\nWith heart abruptly pounding and senses suddenly tense, Grenville\r\nleaned down, with his glowing brand, to complete his work for the night.\r\n\r\nHis hand felt blindly along the limb, to pick up the end of the fuse.\r\nBut someway the place was lost.  More eagerly then, and telling off\r\neach twig like a sign that blazed the trail, he explored the branch\r\nanew.\r\n\r\nHe found the fiber that had held the fuse--but the fuse itself was\r\ngone!  The panic-stricken creature that had climbed the tree had clawed\r\nor broken it down!\r\n\r\nA bitterer disappointment to Grenville could scarcely have been\r\nplanned.  He was sickened all through by disgust, and a sense of the\r\nutter uselessness of all he had striven to accomplish.  With fire in\r\nhand, the bomb all laid, and the tiger actually present--he was\r\nhelpless, after all!\r\n\r\nIt was futile to rage at the cowering beast, above him somewhere in the\r\ndarkness.  He glanced up once and saw its eyes--two blazing coals of\r\nfear and malice, like near-by sinister stars!\r\n\r\n\"By Heavens!  I'll not be cheated!\" he murmured to himself.  A mad new\r\nthought had possessed him.\r\n\r\nThe fuse had been drawn about the tree before it could be fastened near\r\nhis perch.  Had it fallen straight down, when torn from its hold, it\r\nwould still lie close at hand.\r\n\r\nHis ladder was hidden from the tiger's position by the tree.  Any\r\nsounds he must make might be thought to be those of the cat.  There was\r\nno particular danger in descending to the ground--with the ladder near\r\nwith which to regain a safe position.\r\n\r\nNoiselessly, yet not without excitement, he began his retreat from the\r\nbranches.  With every step he paused for a bit, to listen to the sounds\r\nof the tiger.\r\n\r\nThe brute was seemingly quite engrossed in the business of filling his\r\nbelly.  But, despite his utmost efforts at silence, the leaves of one\r\nof the branches loudly rustled as Grenville's weight was intrusted to\r\nthe ladder.\r\n\r\nHe halted and held his breath.  The tiger continued his eating.\r\nHolding his firebrand firmly in his teeth, Grenville slowly and\r\ncautiously descended, with the furtive alertness of a thief.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the earth, he was certain his heart would betray his\r\npresence with its pounding.  He leaned there, heavily, against the\r\ntree, to still the mad leap of his pulses.  Then, at length, he began\r\nto feel about for the fuse that should be at his feet.\r\n\r\nIt was not to be found--and he moved a little outward.  His hand came\r\nin contact with a long, slender thing--but it proved to be a creeper.\r\n\r\nFurther and further out he moved, blindly groping with his fingers.  He\r\nencountered a shrub, and, fumbling between it and the tree, bethought\r\nhim to feel about its crest.  There he found one end of the fuse he\r\nsought--but it proved that the length had been broken!  He held the\r\nuseless end!\r\n\r\nOne despair after another had seized him within an endless minute.\r\nMore recklessly, in a burning fever of impatience, he pawed about and\r\nmoved even closer to the tiger--whose sounds were horribly near.\r\n\r\nHe could almost have uttered a cry of joy when the severed fuse was\r\ndiscovered.  He waited for nothing, but immediately pressed his brand\r\nagainst the sun-dried substance.\r\n\r\nThere was no powder there.  It had spilled when it broke, and it\r\nharmlessly smoked as it burned.\r\n\r\nWhy a groan did not escape him, Sidney could never have told.  He broke\r\noff the tough, resisting substance six inches further along and again\r\napplied his spark.\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if in all its length there could be no powder remaining.\r\nHe was savagely grasping the fuse once more, to break it at a fresher\r\nplace, when a fiery-red line, some four feet away, seemed creeping like\r\na snake out beyond him.\r\n\r\nThe spark that was racing along to the bomb had been started while\r\nstill he was sweating there with baffled and excited impatience.\r\n\r\nHe took no time for further caution, but sprang away to the shelter of\r\nthe tree and caught at a lungful of breath.\r\n\r\nThere was not a sound in all the place.  This much he knew in that\r\nsecond, as he hugged up close to the trunk.  The tiger had ceased to\r\nlap at the meat, and perhaps was poised for a spring.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Grenville, waiting there, that nothing would ever happen.\r\nA thousand doubts went darting through his brain.  The fuse had failed!\r\nIt was broken again.  Or, perhaps----\r\n\r\nA low growl broke the stillness.  There was a sound of something moving\r\ntowards the tree!\r\n\r\nInstantly a frightful red-and-yellow glare leaped upward from the\r\nearth.  A deafening, crashing detonation rent the intimate universe and\r\nshook down incredible stars.  The air was filled to overcrowding with\r\nrushing billows of concussion that rocked the trees as in a storm.\r\n\r\nGrenville went down, dazed and helpless, unable to think, so jarred to\r\nchaos were his senses.  But, beyond being stunned for a moment, he was\r\ntotally unhurt.\r\n\r\nHe leaped to his feet, aware of some mighty disturbance in the curdled,\r\nheavy darkness that had followed.\r\n\r\nThe tiger it was, in some extravagant activity, moving towards\r\nGrenville and the thicket.  He was almost upon the staggering man\r\nbefore he could move to escape.  Then Grenville stumbled towards the\r\nladder.\r\n\r\nThe jar to the limb, as he tugged at a rung, brought something down\r\nfrom above.  This was the creature that had hidden in the tree.  It had\r\npartially fallen, earlier stunned by the huge concussion.  It dropped\r\nupon Grenville leadenly--and down he went in a heap.\r\n\r\nThe three sworn enemies--tiger, man, and jungle-cat--were embroiled on\r\nthe earth together.  Before the man could sufficiently recover to\r\nstagger from his knees to his feet and grasp his club, the tiger flung\r\nout a mighty paw, that struck him a blow upon the chin.\r\n\r\nWithout a sound he sank limberly down, inert and helplessly unconscious.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nGRENVILLE'S RADIANT STAR\r\n\r\nEven had sleep overcome Elaine, the explosion must have startled her\r\nawake like a wildly fluttering bird.\r\n\r\nAll her life she had known the sound of guns, but never before had her\r\nears received such an air-splitting shock as this.\r\n\r\nHer alarm could know no bounds.  It had come so suddenly and\r\nunexpectedly; it had been such a cataclysmic destruction of the\r\nisland's haunting calm!  She was certain some hideous blunder had\r\noccurred--that Grenville, too, had perished by the thing he had\r\nfearlessly dared to create.\r\n\r\nShe had seen for an instant that fan-like glare, as she gazed far out\r\nacross the jungle.  And now, as she stood there, rigid with fears and\r\nfixedly staring at the formless gloom--why did she hear no sound?\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he might--he might call!\" she said, and she tried to halloo, but\r\nin vain.\r\n\r\nShe waited a time that seemed endless for some little sign from the\r\njungle.  He had promised before that, if all went well, he would hasten\r\nhome at once.  Surely this promise held good to-night--especially after\r\nthat explosion!\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was not yet time; perhaps it was farther away than she had\r\nthought.  The glare had seemed near, but he had no torch, and must walk\r\nbut slowly through the thicket.  How dark it must be along the trails,\r\nin that tangle growth, with nothing for a light!  How could he possibly\r\nhasten?\r\n\r\nShe was standing out on the brink of the wall, staring down at the\r\ngloom of the clearing, convinced that her ears, if not her eyes, would\r\ndetect the first sign of his coming.  Just the merest red gleam from\r\nthe firebrand was all she would ask of the darkness--just that dull\r\nlittle star in the firmament of black!\r\n\r\nBut the ebon remained unbroken.  That he might be lost occurred to her\r\nmind, but again she thought it was yet too soon for his return.  She\r\nstumbled swiftly to the fire again, to stir it to brighter refulgence.\r\nIt would seem to him a beacon against the sky to guide his footsteps\r\nhome!\r\n\r\nShe thought of a blazing brand she could carry to the brink of the\r\nwall.  With the largest limb afforded by the fire she returned, in\r\nhaste and eagerness, to wave him a signal of welcome.  And still\r\nnothing came from the clearing.\r\n\r\n\"Sidney!\" she cried through the stillness, at last.  \"Sidney!  Are you\r\nthere?\"\r\n\r\nThe night surrendered no response, save some animal cry far off where\r\nthe barque was rotting.\r\n\r\n\"If he's dead!\" she moaned.  \"If he's dead!\"\r\n\r\nBut he might be wounded and helpless, she thought, with no one to come\r\nto his side.  He might not be hurt unto death itself--if aid could\r\nreach him now!\r\n\r\nIf he died--if he left her thus alone----  A thousand times she\r\npreferred to die beside him!\r\n\r\n\"Sidney!\" she cried, as before.\r\n\r\nWith a strange dry note, choked back between her lips, she fled once\r\nmore to the fire.\r\n\r\nMeantime the man by the tiger's kill continued to lie without motion on\r\nthe earth.  Not even the glow of his cheering brand remained like a\r\nsign of life in that silent theater.\r\n\r\nThe jungle cat, smitten and addled in its brain, had dragged itself\r\npainfully away to the cover of the thicket, its instinct feebly alive.\r\nThere was not a sound in all the place, where crash and roar had been\r\nso tremendously expended for one prodigious second.\r\n\r\nA vague, weird dream came finally creeping intangibly through\r\nGrenville's brain, resuming an intermittent function.  When at length\r\nit began a little to clear, he dreamed he was trying his utmost to\r\nrise, but something held him down.\r\n\r\nConsciousness poured a trickle through his being, and he felt he was\r\npartially awake.  Then a flood, a cataract of surging life, rushing\r\nback to its centers, brought confusion and tumult to his thoughts.  He\r\nwas still only partially aroused.\r\n\r\nHis eyes at length were opened.  The darkness which their gaze\r\nencountered seemed more complete than that of his region of dreams.  He\r\nattempted to rise, but his muscles and nerves refused their customary\r\nobedience to his will.  He tried to remember what had happened, but the\r\nglancing blow sustained on his chin had blotted him out, temporarily,\r\nlike a stroke of death itself.  And, had the stroke been more direct,\r\nhis jaw or his neck must have broken.\r\n\r\nWhen he raised his head a bit from the ground and propped himself up on\r\nhis elbow, the sense of dullness and leadlike weight in both his feet\r\nand legs continued unabated.  He was battling to retain his\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nHe began to remember, slowly.  The process was only well started,\r\nhowever, when it was singularly interrupted.  He was staring blankly\r\nthrough the jungle, which he partially recollected.  It was funny, he\r\nthought, how a star should fall and wander through all those aisles of\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nIt was a star, he was fully convinced, coming haltingly through the\r\ngloom.  Its course was erratic.  He lost it at times, but still it\r\npersisted in approaching.  How beautiful it was--the largest star he\r\nhad ever known--with its flames divinely ascending.\r\n\r\nHe sat up stiffly, his will momentarily gaining strength to resume the\r\nsway of his body.  Some mantle partially fell from his brain, to\r\naccompany his physical rousing.  Then he knew, not only what had\r\nhappened, but also what was happening.\r\n\r\n\"Elaine!\" he tried to call aloud, vainly striving to rise or regain the\r\nuse of his limbs, then once more he sank in oblivion.\r\n\r\nA strange, wild note broke from her lips as Elaine came plunging along\r\nthe trail with a torch redly blazing in her hand, held well above her\r\nface.\r\n\r\nShe saw, before she could reach his side, that the tiger lay lifeless\r\nupon him.  She feared the man was dead, but, with wits exceptionally\r\nclear and ordered, she thrust her torch-end firmly in the earth, laid\r\nhold of the huge, limber beast she so fearfully dreaded, and tugged and\r\ndragged it feverishly off with all her fine young strength.\r\n\r\nThe face of the inert man beside the tree was redly smeared with blood.\r\nHe lay horribly loose and still upon the grass.  She knelt at his side\r\nand placed her hands upon him, feeling above his heart.\r\n\r\n\"Sidney!\" she said to him.  \"Sidney!  You cannot--you shall not die!  I\r\nnever meant the things I said--or thought--or anything!  Oh, please,\r\nplease don't--don't look like that!  You've got to come back--you've\r\ngot to!\"\r\n\r\nShe tore at the band about his neck and lifted his head on her knee.\r\nShe wiped the red from his pallid face with the hem of her briar-torn\r\nskirt.\r\n\r\n\"I'll find the spring!\" she told him eagerly, starting as if to rise,\r\nbut the still form moved, and, dully at first, the two heavy eyes were\r\nopened.\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" she said.  \"Oh, you're hurt.  Don't try to do anything but\r\nrest....  You didn't come--you didn't come home!\"\r\n\r\nDespite her entreaty, Grenville weakly raised his head and propped\r\nhimself, half sitting.  The weight being gone from his outstretched\r\nlegs, his normal circulation was returning.  He regained his strength\r\nwith characteristic swiftness.\r\n\r\n\"Hurt?\" he said.  \"No--I don't believe----  I must have got a knockout\r\nblow.  The tiger?  Did I get the tiger?\"\r\n\r\nHe sat up uncertainly and, glancing about, saw the huge striped form\r\nwhere Elaine had dragged it from his body.  She still remained on her\r\nknees, fixedly gazing on his face.  Her strength was ebbing rapidly, as\r\nGrenville's now returned.\r\n\r\n\"You didn't come home,\" she repeated, by way of explaining her presence\r\nat his side.  \"I couldn't live here alone.\"\r\n\r\nGrenville arose and assisted her weakly to her feet.  She stumbled to\r\nand leaned against the tree.\r\n\r\n\"By George!\" he said, \"I'll bet a hat you could!\"\r\n\r\nHe knew what courage had come to her aid before she could make her\r\nexcursion.  \"I went down like a dub,\" he added, in his customary\r\nmanner.  \"No good excuse, but I do apologize.  Better get out of this,\r\nI'm thinking.\"\r\n\r\nHe took up the torch she had planted in the earth, to examine the\r\ntiger, dead and mangled in the grass, One of the creature's great front\r\npaws had been rudely torn from his body.  He could only have escaped\r\ninstantaneous death by having moved from the bomb at the moment of its\r\nexplosion.\r\n\r\n\"Your robe looks mussed,\" Grenville continued, with a gesture towards\r\nthe animal's motionless body.  \"But I think it can be washed.\"\r\n\r\nElaine slightly shivered at sight of the frame now done with life.\r\n\r\n\"You've killed him,\" she said.  \"I'm glad!\"\r\n\r\nHe took her firmly by the arm and led her away through the thicket.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the camp, Elaine was not yet fully convinced that\r\nGrenville was uninjured.  She brought him a rag she had torn from some\r\nof her clothing and begged him to wash his reddened jaw.  Even the\r\nrestoration of his former stubbled complexion could not suffice to\r\nbring her that sense of certainty and calm essential before she could\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nShe remained beside him at their fire till long past the midnight hour.\r\nIndeed, she had made no move to retire when at length the weird,\r\nunwelcome disturbance made by the tide had begun its uncanny chorus.\r\nPerhaps she had waited for the conclusion of this added feature of the\r\nnight's long ritual of nerve-attacking events, for she seemed to be\r\nconsiderably cheered when its final wail had died upon the air.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me that doesn't continue quite as long as it did at\r\nfirst,\" she said to Grenville, as she rose at last to go alone to her\r\ncavern....  \"I think you ought to rest.  I wish you would.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" said Sidney.  \"Good-night.\"\r\n\r\nBut, for some time after she had gone, he sat there wondering if those\r\nabominable but protective cries, that haunted the island's solitude,\r\nwere actually on the wane.\r\n\r\n\"God help us if they are!\" he said, to himself, but he went to bed and\r\nslept.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nA GIRDLE OF GOLD\r\n\r\nElaine had not yet appeared on the scene when Grenville went down to\r\nthe jungle.  The morning hour was still decidedly early, but plans and\r\nimpatience to be up and at work had prodded the man from his rest.  The\r\nlassitude that should have followed his night of excitement had not yet\r\nlaid its weight upon him.\r\n\r\nApparently nothing had come to the jungle scene where the tiger had met\r\nhis end.  The great form lay there, torn and rigid, but no sign of the\r\ncat could be discovered.\r\n\r\nGrenville passed his trophy, presently, to examine the space beyond.\r\nThe spot where the bomb had exploded was a gaping hole in the earth.\r\nThis was not the place where Grenville had placed the deadly tube,\r\nwhich he knew must therefore have been moved--doubtless when the fuse\r\nwas pulled and broken by the creature taking refuge in the tree.\r\n\r\nAll about the spot where the kill had been the shrubbery was shredded.\r\nThe boar's remains had been blown away when the gap was made in the\r\nsod.  The trail, Grenville saw, must be repaired or a new one must be\r\nmade about the place.\r\n\r\nHe returned to the tiger, and was suddenly elated to behold the metal\r\ncollar, half-hidden by the fur about his neck.  He had quite forgotten\r\nthis bauble, thus singularly employed, and, kneeling down to inspect it\r\nclosely, not only found it was massive gold and set with costly jewels,\r\nbut also discovered he must break or force a heavy link to take it from\r\nthe creature.\r\n\r\nIt was not until he had brought two sharp-edged rocks to his needs that\r\nthe collar was finally freed.  Its weight and worth then amazed him.\r\nThe band was fully two inches in width, with the edges curved up and\r\nturned under, in a simple and hammer-marked finish.  It was all\r\nhand-wrought, each blow that the smith had struck with his tool being\r\nfaintly recorded in the metal.  The jewels--three sapphires, three\r\nrubies, and one diamond--were simply and solidly set with bands that\r\nbarely clasped their bases.  The rubies only were cabochon cut, the\r\nother stones gleaming with facets.\r\n\r\nThere was not a mark upon the collar's outer surface to show what was\r\nmeant by its presence here in such extraordinary keeping.  But\r\nGrenville presently bethought him to glance at the inner circumference.\r\nHe was not in the least astonished, but he was a bit concerned, to\r\ndiscover a number of those mystic symbols, deeply graved in the gold,\r\nthat had once been tattooed on the man sitting dead in the barque.\r\n\r\nHere were the three hills, bounded by the water, and one with the tree\r\non its summit, while on either side the cartouch appeared, bounded by\r\ncrude drawings of the tiger.  That the brute had been liberated here\r\nupon the island as a sort of sacred guardian of the cave that was\r\nmentioned by the writing found secreted with the map, Grenville could\r\nnot, or did not, doubt.  There was nothing more to be found engraved on\r\nthe gold.\r\n\r\nHe finally slipped the heavy band about his own smooth, sun-tanned neck\r\nand went at the task of securing Elaine's promised robe.  This toil was\r\nfar more difficult than even his lack of proper appliances had led him\r\nto anticipate.  Although he had sharpened his stub of a knife-blade to\r\na very respectable cutting-edge, it was far too small for the business.\r\n\r\nHis doggedness and application were the assets on which he had most to\r\ncount, and without them here he must have failed.  As it was, he\r\nremained so long away that Elaine, who was up, was alarmed.  And, when\r\nat last he appeared below with the heavy, striped skin across his\r\nshoulder, she started abruptly, till she saw he was not another tiger.\r\n\r\n\"I thought you might like to see the size of his hide,\" he said, as he\r\nbrought it to the terrace, \"before I take it down by the shore for\r\ntanning.  I shall soak it a while in a mixture of brine and saltpeter.\r\nBoth are highly preservative---and the best the island affords.\"\r\n\r\n\"He was simply tremendous!\" Elaine replied, when the skin had been\r\nspread on the rocks.  \"What have you got about your neck?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, this?\" said Grenville, removing the golden collar.  \"This is a\r\nsymbol of royalty that his Bengal highness wore--your property now, as\r\na trophy of the hunt.\"\r\n\r\nShe took it a little uncertainly as he held it forth in his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Why--it's gold!\" she said.  \"These jewels----  The tiger was wearing\r\nthis?\"\r\n\r\n\"About his kingly neck.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how--unless someone put it on?\"\r\n\r\n\"Undoubtedly someone did.  He must have been a captive once, and\r\nprobably escaped.\"\r\n\r\nIt could serve no good end to acquaint her with his actual suspicions,\r\nwhich might be ill-founded, after all.\r\n\r\n\"It's beautiful,\" she continued, gazing in admiration on the collar's\r\nsimple massiveness.  \"But it's not for me, I'm sure.\"  She held it out\r\nfor him to take.  But he bent above the skin.\r\n\r\n\"Then pitch it away,\" he instructed, laconically.  \"Toss it into the\r\nsea.\"\r\n\r\nShe colored, looking at him strangely.  She could not throw away his\r\nproperty--anything of such great intrinsic value.  She was baffled\r\nagain, as he managed so frequently.  Her hand and the golden circlet\r\nfell at her side.  She could think of no appropriate speech of final\r\nrejection.  A whimsical notion only arose to her groping mind.\r\n\r\n\"Fancy me wearing this priceless band of splendor,\" she said, \"and\r\neating with a stick!\"\r\n\r\n\"It will just about fit around your waist,\" he conjectured, taking it\r\nfrom her as he rose.  With easy strength he bent it in his hands, to\r\nmake it more snugly conform to her slender and graceful little body.\r\n\r\nWhy should he not bend it thus, she thought, who had wrenched it from a\r\ntiger?  She felt how weak and inadequate was her own diminishing\r\nstruggle.  But to wear this band--a symbol, almost, of Grenville's\r\nownership----  A hot recurrence of her former pride came surging to her\r\nbosom.\r\n\r\n\"It's too heavy to wear,\" she told him, a trifle coldly.  She once more\r\naccepted the girdle, however, despite herself, from his hand.  \"The\r\ntiger that wore it,\" she concluded, \"met with a lot of trouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"You've met with some yourself,\" he answered, candidly, and he\r\nshouldered the skin and started off for the estuary's mouth.\r\n\r\nElaine burned suddenly scarlet, interpreting his speech in some manner\r\nof her own.  Helplessly she carried the girdle to her cave, and left it\r\nthere in a hollow of the rock.\r\n\r\nThe incident concerned with the tiger was practically closed.  A new,\r\nbright era of security and liberty thereupon commenced, particularly\r\nfor Elaine.  She could not take immediate advantage of the comfort thus\r\nvouchsafed in moving about the island, but at least her worry was\r\nlessened when Grenville was obliged to venture in the jungle.\r\n\r\nHis return to the work so frequently interrupted was delayed but the\r\nbriefest time.  So eager did he constantly feel to accomplish his\r\nboat's completion that he had grudged every hour the tiger had cost him\r\nfrom his labors.\r\n\r\nWith no thought of sparing his tireless strength, he promptly resumed\r\nthe task of digging and fetching the clay.  Elaine might have joined\r\nhim in the clearing now had not some task she was eager to complete\r\nengrossed her attentions at the shelter.\r\n\r\nThat day the remaining surface of his prostrate log was plastered by\r\nGrenville's eager hands.  He likewise mixed sufficient clay to finish\r\nhis furnace in the morning.  The fire that was helping to hollow his\r\nlog was once again ignited.  Much of the old charred substance, left\r\nfrom previous operations, Grenville knocked away with an improvised\r\ntool of brass, in order to daub more clay inside the shell before the\r\nflames could continue removing the wood as he required.\r\n\r\nOn the following day, while the walls in his smelter were drying,\r\nSidney wove a two-piece door of wattle--framework of creepers,\r\nplastered with clay--to fit across the orifice at the bottom of his\r\ntree.  With this he felt he could regulate the draught and protect\r\nhimself while removing his crucibles of metal.  The top door only would\r\nbe tossed aside to accomplish this latter purpose.\r\n\r\nHe likewise plastered the edges and sides of the hole that pierced his\r\nsmelter.  He knew the heat, when he came to melt the brass, would\r\nspread at once to all unprotected wood.  After that he had still to\r\ncontrive a clay-covered implement for lifting out his crucibles, and a\r\ntripod affair to be placed inside the furnace to support these\r\ncrucibles upon.\r\n\r\nWhat with more work done upon the boat-to-be, and a goodly portion of\r\nthe afternoon expended in killing and preparing another of the\r\npheasants for their dinner, Grenville's hours sped swiftly away.\r\n\r\nA weary but elated craftsman he was that day-end when at length he\r\nreturned for the final time to the terrace.  He had been to the shore,\r\nwhere the tiger-hide was curing in a strong solution of brine and\r\nsaltpeter, mixed in a hollow in the sand, and, having there turned it\r\nover, had washed himself to a fresh and ruddy color.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the unbecoming growth of beard upon his face, he\r\nappeared to Elaine the most commanding figure she had ever taken time\r\nto inspect.  He looked every inch a master of the island, if not also\r\nof his fate and her own.  But she was more than usually excited that\r\nevening, as she disappeared within her shelter.\r\n\r\nShe presently emerged with such an air of uncertainty and diffidence\r\nabout her as had never before appeared since their coming to the\r\nisland.  But she did not hesitate in the task she had set herself to\r\nperform.\r\n\r\n\"I have finished my first bit of knitting,\" she said, \"and there it is.\"\r\n\r\nTo Grenville's thorough amazement, the clean, new article held in her\r\nhand, and shyly offered for his acceptance, was a cap she had made for\r\nhis head.  It was not unlike a golf-cap in shape, but the visor was\r\nconsiderably wider, to protect his eyes from the sun.\r\n\r\nShe had woven this of finely divided creeper-core on a frame neatly\r\nmade of the same.  Its meshes had then been filled by fibers, snugly\r\nand neatly plaited back and forth to make it opaque to the light.  The\r\nframe was firmly knitted to the cap.\r\n\r\n\"Pretty good,\" said Grenville, busied with several arrows.  \"Thanks;\"\r\nand, placing it carelessly on his head, continued with his employment.\r\n\r\nElaine, who had conjured all her resolution to make of the presentation\r\nthe merest commonplace affair, was wholly confounded in her thoughts by\r\nthe man's unheard-of conduct, after all she had recently undergone\r\nbefore she could make him such a gift.\r\n\r\nShe had feared some demonstration of the passion shown on the ship--or\r\nat least some disturbing outburst she had armed herself to quench.  But\r\nthis--such scant courtesy or gratitude as this--left her absolutely\r\nimpotent and baffled.\r\n\r\nShe was piqued, disappointed, chagrined.  It was horrid of anyone, she\r\nwas sure, to be so outrageously unfeeling.  There was nothing, however,\r\nshe could do, and nothing she could say.  Standing there, mortified,\r\nalmost angry, and conscious she was burning guiltily red with various\r\nemotions that he did not even notice, was such a footless and\r\nirritating proceeding, with the situation robbed of its point.\r\n\r\nShe turned away, fairly ready to cry with vexation, and pretended to\r\nmake herself busy with things already well prepared for their evening\r\nmeal.  But the new rebellion of her nature, partially begotten by the\r\nuncontrolled and uncontrollable impulses loosed in the jungle the\r\nprevious night, when Grenville lay helplessly stunned, with his head\r\nloosely pillowed on her knee, was not to be longer contained.  She\r\npresently fled from before the cavern, across, through the shadows of\r\nthe terrace, to the hidden shelf where Grenville had angled for fish.\r\n\r\nThere she suddenly sank to her knees on the rocks and covered her face\r\nwith her hands.\r\n\r\n\"I hate him!\" she said, in a hot and passionate utterance, suggestive\r\nof a sob.  \"I hate him!  I hate him!  I hate every man that ever\r\nlived--and you, Gerald Fenton, as much as all the others!\"\r\n\r\nShe snatched off the ring from her finger.  It was Fenton's ring, with\r\na single stone that gleamed in the failing light.  It seemed to her to\r\nrepresent the man far absent from her side.\r\n\r\n\"It was you who brought it all about!\" she continued, in her fiercely\r\nwaging conflict, and, overwrought, she cast it down on the ledge as if\r\nit burned her palm.\r\n\r\nIt bounded lightly where it struck and, clearing the shelf, fell\r\nswiftly downward to the water.  A gasp and a moan escaped her lips\r\ntogether.  Vividly, of a sudden, she remembered Grenville's prediction\r\nthat she would throw it away in the sea.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Gerald, I didn't mean to!\" she moaned.  \"I didn't!  You've got to\r\nbelieve me!\"  She sank farther forward on the ledge, her face closely\r\nhidden in the curve of her loose brown arm.  She wept and wept there,\r\nbitterly, in a mood of mixed emotions.\r\n\r\n\"I hate him!  I hate him!\" she said, as before.  \"It's not my fault in\r\nthe least!\"\r\n\r\nAnd after a time, as Grenville did not come, she returned to the camp\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nMOLTEN METAL AND HOPES\r\n\r\nThe following day was calmer for Elaine, and vastly interesting, since\r\nGrenville's smelting operations were begun.  She told herself that\r\ninterest only laid its hold upon her nature, and, being a woman, she\r\nknew.\r\n\r\nThe clay that lined his hollow tree was sufficiently dry at last for\r\nGrenville's fire.  The other accessories, all more thinly coated, were\r\nlikewise ready for his use.  He began in the morning to heat his\r\nnatural chimney against the actual needs of afternoon.  The small fire\r\nkindled upon its hearth established at once the efficiency of the\r\ndraught.\r\n\r\nNot without a certain boyish eagerness in the culmination of his\r\nlabors, Sidney began the assemblage of his various paraphernalia an\r\nhour at least before noon.  His molds and crucibles he carefully\r\nbrought from the summit of the terrace, disposing them as conveniently\r\nas his crude conditions permitted.  All his rusted scraps and useless\r\nbits of brass and bronze were divided into parcels, while salt, some\r\npowdered charcoal, and an over-abundant supply of saltpeter were\r\nprovided to be used as flux, according as the smelting might demand.\r\nHe could not be certain of which he should use till experiment should\r\ndetermine which, if any, rendered good results.\r\n\r\nThe principal difficulty, he soon discovered, would be adding the fuel\r\nto his flames.  His smelter-door was not well arranged for this\r\nessential business.  He expected, however, to heap a considerable\r\nquantity of wood inside before the chimney should become too hot.\r\nLater he thought a lot of short material could be readily introduced,\r\nand against this need he gathered an impressive heap of branches, which\r\nhe broke to a workable length.\r\n\r\nElaine was with him when at last the work began.  She was far more\r\nexcited than Grenville seemed, since it appeared to her no less than a\r\nmiracle that any man, in a place like this, should dare assume such a\r\nmastery over Jovian metals and flame.  She had never before seen\r\nanything of smelting.  This intimate acquaintance with its mysteries\r\nseemed to her a privilege, greatly enhanced by the fact that the lord\r\nof it all pretended she was actually helpful.\r\n\r\nShe assisted when he bound the sections of his clay-made molds\r\ntogether.  She handed him fuel when the furnace-door was opened and\r\ngushes of heat came voluminously forth.\r\n\r\nThe fire, which for a time had loudly roared, was now more intense and\r\nquiet.  The volumes of smoke, which the \"chimney\" had belched, had\r\nlikewise finally ceased.  Only a quiver of superheated air and a\r\ngreenish bit of gas and fume now ascended to the sky.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time, Grenville opened the top of the door to peer within.\r\nHe wrinkled his features, in the waves of heat, and held his hand\r\nbefore his face.  At length he adjusted his \"tongs\" about a crucible\r\nand drew it entirely forth.\r\n\r\nIt was white with heat, its surface sparkling with a hundred tiny stars\r\nthat died on its glowing surface.\r\n\r\n\"Just toss in some of that stuff there on the leaf,\" he quietly\r\ninstructed Elaine.  \"It will soon be ready to pour.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"stuff\" was flux, and Elaine obeyed directions like the stanch\r\nassistant that she was.  She wondered what was coming next.\r\n\r\nIt came very soon.  She was certain no ruddier figure of Vulcan,\r\nemploying mighty flame, had ever been presented than now when Grenville\r\nmade ready for the climax of his work.\r\n\r\nHe removed the door as he had not previously done, and set it aside\r\nfrom his path.  He thrust in his tongs, while flame and heat came\r\npouring out to paint him a deep and glowing color.  Then, seemingly\r\nhotter than ever before, and smoking goldenly above its blinding\r\nincandescence, the first of the crucibles, itself fairly dripping,\r\nwhere some of the flux had trickled down its surface, was supported\r\nover to the molds, to be quickly and vigorously skimmed of its oxidized\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nBut the molten brass, indescribably beautiful, with ruby and gold and\r\nsilver gleams imbedded and breaking in its substance, was the wonder of\r\nit all.  Elaine stood entranced, to see it flow and fill the hollows of\r\nthe molds.\r\n\r\nThe second was hastily drawn from the flame, and then the third and\r\nlast.  But not till all lay finally empty and smoking on the earth,\r\ntheir surfaces rapidly dulling, did Grenville pause to look at Elaine\r\nand smile.\r\n\r\n\"Can't even tell what we've done,\" he said, \"till the molds are cooled\r\nand opened.\"\r\n\r\n\"Must you wait very long till you know?\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't wait long,\" Grenville answered.  \"I'm too much of a curious\r\nkid.\"\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, brass poured in a mold begins to harden at once.\r\nIn less than fifteen minutes, Grenville was gingerly untwisting the hot\r\ncopper wire that bound each mold together.  Soon after that the first\r\nof his tools, a heavy and serviceable chisel, lay uncovered to the air.\r\n\r\nIt was still glowing hot, although no longer red.  It was darker, less\r\nbrassy in appearance than Elaine had expected to see, but it seemed to\r\nher a wonderful thing to be made of those useless bits of metal.\r\n\r\nThe tool next in importance was much like a butcher's cleaver--an\r\nimplement intended for cutting or hacking wood or branches, either to\r\nclear a path in the jungle or to rough out anything of timber.  The\r\nedge of this casting was imperfect, where the metal had failed to flow.\r\nBoth it and the chisel had a thin fringe of brass along those sections\r\nwhere the halves of the mold had come together, but this would be\r\nreadily broken away and was quite to be expected.\r\n\r\nSmaller chisels, a blade that Sidney expected to notch along its edge\r\nto make a species of saw, and a number of smaller implements were\r\ncontained in the other sets of molds.  None of these was perfect, and\r\none or two merely served to instruct the master-molder in the way to go\r\nto work another time.  But the net results were highly satisfactory,\r\nand seemed to Elaine a veritable triumph.\r\n\r\nThe poorness of their quality as tools with which to accomplish swift\r\nresults developed the following day.  Grenville had melted a part of\r\nhis lead and cast the head of a hammer.  With this and the largest of\r\nhis chisels he attacked the log chosen for a boat.\r\n\r\nSo long as his gouging was confined to the portions charred by the\r\nfire, the tool held well to the labor.  Its edge soon went to pieces,\r\nhowever, when the solider substance was encountered.  It was sharpened\r\nrepeatedly.  He early foresaw that, work as he might, the business of\r\nconjuring forth a boat from material so raw was certain to be slow, if\r\nnot exhausting.\r\n\r\nIndeed, at this time a tedious period began.  There were days and days\r\nof dull, stupid repetition ahead like the ones that were presently\r\npast.  Fire after fire he maintained beneath the log, which must always\r\nbe newly plastered with the clay.  Hour after hour he chiseled off the\r\nblack and dusty flakes that the flames would leave behind, since it\r\nhastened the work to present a new surface to the heat.  It seemed as\r\nif the task could never have an end.\r\n\r\nBut, if this was a season of dogged application to an uncongenial\r\nbusiness, it was likewise the one long era of peace vouchsafed to the\r\nexiled pair.  There was nothing to rouse a sense of alarm in any near\r\nportion of the jungle.  And, if those fast succeeding days brought no\r\nwelcome sign of a steamer approaching on the distant blue horizon,\r\nneither did their lengthening hours develop those craft upon the sea\r\nfor which Grenville was constantly and apprehensively watching.  They\r\nwere happy days, as well as peaceful.  Concerning the ring she had lost\r\nin the sea, Elaine could not force herself to worry.  Grenville never,\r\nby any chance, gave her occasion for alarm.\r\n\r\nThere were many full afternoon vacations from his work when the fire\r\nwas left to hollow out his log that Sidney spent at her side.  He wove\r\nher a hammock of the creeper withes and built a shady bower by the\r\nshore.  He had sawed her a comb from the tortoiseshell, bent hairpins\r\nof the copper wire, and made her a comfortable couch.  Her tiger-skin\r\nrobe he had worked with his hands to a soft and pliant finish.  The\r\nskin of a cheeta he had killed he used to supplement his rapidly\r\nvanishing shirt.  Sewing was strongly, if not prettily, accomplished\r\nwith such needles and thread as his ready ingenuity provided.\r\n\r\nThey were busy days that were doomed, however, to pall.  Elaine was\r\nassisting with a loom to weave a sail, while between times Grenville\r\nchipped out the stone for the bath he had promised on the ledge.  He\r\nbecame a skillful marksman with his bow, and knew every animal trail\r\nthe island afforded.  In many of these his traps did deadly service.\r\nTheir larder rarely lacked for meat, made tender by paw-paw leaves.\r\nElaine caught many a silver fish that they roasted together in the sand.\r\n\r\nBut her gaze more frequently roved afar, for the ship that did not\r\ncome.  The days were growing sultrier, and constantly more monotonous.\r\n\r\nThe new moon had come and waxed to the full and was once more waning in\r\nthe heavens.  They were marvelous nights the old orb made upon the\r\nisland, but always weird and exciting a sense, in Elaine at least, of\r\nloneliness and aloofness from the world.  On their cliff above the\r\nmurmurous tides, she and Grenville frequently sat for hours at a time\r\nwithout exchanging a word.\r\n\r\nSuch times were fraught with strangely exciting moments; and subtle\r\ntinglings came unbidden to her nature, giving her pleasures wildly\r\nlawless and precious beyond expression.  Yet she feared them also when\r\nthey came, and refused to give them meaning.\r\n\r\nBut to-night a new wistfulness burned in her eyes as she turned to her\r\nsilent companion.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" she said, \"if we couldn't put a fresher flag on our pole\r\nto-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sure shot,\" said Sid, \"the freshest flag that ever grew.\"\r\n\r\nShe was silent again for several moments.  Then she said:\r\n\r\n\"What should we do if a year went by--two years, perhaps, or even\r\nmore--and a ship should never come?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do?\" said Grenville.  \"Sail away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know.  But I mean, supposing we found no place to go--and had to\r\ncome back every time.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm!\" said Grenville, rubbing the corner of his jaw, \"you probably\r\nalso mean to suppose we were always unmolested.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, yes, of course.  Who could come to molest us here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Molesters,\" he said, \"if anyone.  But perhaps they never would.\"\r\n\r\nHe had given no answer to her question, which she hardly cared to\r\nrepeat.  It was one of the times, which frequently came, when she could\r\nnot prevent herself from wondering if this strong, primal man she had\r\nonce called a brute could have utterly forgotten the passionate\r\ndeclaration made on the steamship \"Inca\" the day before the wreck.\r\n\r\nShe wondered also, had he meant it at the time?  Or had one of his many\r\ninscrutable moods possessed him, barely for the moment?  She had never\r\ndared recently confess to herself what feelings might instantly invade\r\nher tingling nature should she learn he had only pretended, perhaps on\r\nsome wager with Gerald, as a test of her faithfulness and love.\r\n\r\nIt was womanlike, merely, on her part, to desire to know his mind.  No\r\nwoman may long resent being loved by a strong and masterful man.  And\r\nElaine was delightfully typical of all her delightful sex.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" she presently said, \"we've been here now much longer than we\r\never expected that day when we arrived.\"\r\n\r\nHis gaze, which had been averted, now swung to a meeting with her own.\r\nShe had never seemed lovelier, braver, more sweetly disposed than now.\r\nThe moonlight deepened her luminous eyes till the man fairly held his\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\n\"Elaine,\" he said, finally, glancing once more towards the silvered\r\nsea, \"what is your notion of love?\"\r\n\r\nThe shock of the word threw all her wits into confusion.\r\n\r\n\"My notion?\" she stammered, helplessly, feeling the hot flames leap\r\nlike floods of his molten metal to her neck, her face, and her bosom.\r\n\"I don't believe--I have--any notions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your convictions, then?\" he amended.  \"Or, if you like, your\r\nprinciples?\"\r\n\r\n\"My--my principles of--of all that--are--just about like--everyone\r\nelse's, I suppose,\" she managed to answer, fragmentarily, \"--being\r\nhonest--and true--and faithful--unto death.\"\r\n\r\n\"To the one that you _really_ love?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--certainly--of course.\"  The heat in her face increased, so\r\nsignificant had she felt his words with that low even tone of emphasis.\r\n\r\nHe stared so long at the sea after that she began to suspect he had not\r\neven heard her reply.  After a time she was tempted to play, just a\r\ntrifle, with the fire.  She added, \"Why did you ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wanted to know.\"  Once more he fell dumb, and again she waited, afraid\r\nhe would, and more afraid he would not, continue the delicate topic.\r\nOnce again, also, she was tempted.\r\n\r\n\"And what,\" she inquired, \"is your--notion?\"\r\n\r\nHe did not turn.  \"Of love or crocodiles?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of--of love--was what you asked me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe I did,\" he responded.  \"Oh, about the same as yours!\"\r\n\r\nElaine had received but scanty satisfaction.  After another long\r\nsilence she ventured to say:\r\n\r\n\"We might have to be here a year--or even longer.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned to her directly.  \"Do you like it here, Elaine?\"\r\n\r\nShe would not reply, and therefore demanded, \"Do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm a savage,\" he admitted.  \"This sort of thing appeals to something\r\nin my blood.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" she answered, understandingly, \"--building up an empire with\r\nyour naked hands, unaided--conquering metals and elements--wresting the\r\nisland's dominion from the brutes.  Naturally you love it!\"\r\n\r\nHe reddened.  \"I can't make an apple dumpling and make it right!  This\r\nisland's dominion?  Great Cæsar's frying-pan--this is a regular\r\npicnic-ground, with everything on earth provided!\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled.  \"And things all made and ready, including tools and\r\npowder, not to mention a tiger-skin rug....  You refuse to admit you\r\nlike it for itself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Like it or not,\" he answered, \"we must get away--and home.\"\r\n\r\n\"Home,\" she repeated, oddly.  \"Home....  I wonder if home will ever\r\nseem----  It certainly would be wonderful, a miracle, I think, to see a\r\nsteamer really coming--and to go on board and have it take us back\r\nto--everything--somewhere home----  But we'd sometimes think of this--a\r\nlittle?\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably.\"\r\n\r\nTo save his life, he could not banish thoughts of Fenton.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure we would,\" murmured Elaine.  She gazed away, to the jungle's\r\nsoftened shadows.  She wanted to cry out abruptly that she loved it\r\nto-night, with a love that could never die.  She wanted the comfort of\r\nsomething, she hardly dared wonder what.  After another long silence,\r\nshe finally said, with eyes averted and excitement throbbing in her\r\nveins:\r\n\r\n\"I know the name of this little place--do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he said, wondering what she might have discovered.  \"What do you\r\nthink it is called?\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Elaine her heart pounded out her reply.\r\n\r\n\"The Isle of Shalimar.\"\r\n\r\nIf Grenville knew the Indian name for Garden, he made no sign that she\r\ncould read.  He made no reply whatsoever, but gazed as before at the\r\nsea.\r\n\r\nHe was turning at last when a low, but distinctly briefer, recurrence\r\nof the island's haunting wails arose to disturb the wondrous calm--as\r\nwell as his peace of mind.  There could be no doubt the tidal\r\nphenomenon was gradually but steadily failing.\r\n\r\nWhat might occur when it altogether ceased was more than the man could\r\ndivine.  He felt a vague dread of that approaching hour and of what it\r\nmight develop.\r\n\r\n\"It must be after midnight,\" he said, at last, \"--time for night's\r\nordinary dreams.\"\r\n\r\nYet, when he was finally stretched on his bed, he did not lose himself\r\nin slumber.  Instead he lay thinking of the island's haunting sounds\r\nand the cave somewhere underneath the headland.\r\n\r\nHe had meant to attempt an inspection of this place, if only to gratify\r\na natural curiosity.  The thought occurred to him now that, in case of\r\ndire necessity, it might afford such a shelter as was not to be found\r\non any other portion of the island.  It was not a thing to be\r\nneglected.  He made up his mind that the following day he would make an\r\nexploration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nA TOMB OF STONE\r\n\r\nThe ladder that Grenville constructed in the morning was not entirely\r\nnew.  He had found upon testing the original contrivance, made for his\r\nséance with the tiger, that, although the creepers had become quite\r\ndry, they were neither weak nor brittle.\r\n\r\nHe fortified the older section with additional material, however, to\r\nmake absolutely certain it would not abruptly part and drop him into\r\nthe sea.  All morning he worked, while his smoldering fires continued\r\nto eat out the hollow for his boat, securing new length to the rungs\r\nalready provided, since the distance down from the brink of the cliff\r\nwas fully one hundred feet.\r\n\r\nTo Elaine he explained that he thought perhaps a cave might exist in\r\nthe rock.  The wailing sounds, it was easy to argue, would indicate\r\nsome such cavity, which he felt it important to examine.  If she\r\nsomewhat divined the further fact that he hoped to discover a possible\r\nretreat, should unforeseen dangers threaten, she made no revelation of\r\nher thought.\r\n\r\nIt was not without considerable anxiety, however, that she finally\r\ndiscovered precisely what he meant to attempt.  His ladder, she was\r\ncertain, was far too frail for any such business as climbing down,\r\nabove that boiling tide.  One careless step, or a parting of the\r\nstrands, and nothing on earth could save the man from death on the\r\njutting rocks below.  She had glanced at the waters under the cliff,\r\nand their crystal depths were not at all reassuring.\r\n\r\nThe thorough precautions against a mishap that Grenville finally\r\ncompleted considerably lessened her fears, yet she had no wish to watch\r\nhim descend when at length he slipped over the edge.  She was gazing\r\nwith fixed and wide-open eyes at the heap of rocks in which he had\r\nfastened the ladder.\r\n\r\nThe matter to Grenville seemed simple enough.  The brink overhung the\r\nwall itself, in consequence of which the ladder swung quite free, down\r\nthe face of the scarp, till it touched at a jutting ledge below.  It\r\nswayed to and fro and sagged a bit loosely at some of the rungs, but it\r\ncould not be broken by his weight.\r\n\r\nHe made no attempt at a rapid descent, neither did he pause to enjoy\r\nthe scenery.  When the ledge was reached he rested, made certain no\r\nsharp-edged stone could impinge upon and perhaps cut into his twisted\r\ncreepers, and again proceeded downward.\r\n\r\nHis course for a matter of two or three fathoms was rendered rather\r\nmore difficult by the fact the ladder lay closely bent against the\r\nwall, instead of hanging free.  The rock face was pitted and\r\nexceedingly rough, its indentations ill-arranged for footholds and far\r\ntoo treacherous for any such employment.\r\n\r\nGrenville was nearly at the lower lip of this projection before he\r\nattempted a look below to determine what he was approaching.  He\r\ndiscovered then it was undercut again--and likewise that his ladder was\r\nconsiderably short.  Its lower end dangled about with irregular\r\ngyrations as he shifted his weight from rung to rung.  It was fully two\r\nyards above the water.  There was nothing in sight on which to plant\r\nhis feet, so far as he could discern from the point then occupied.\r\n\r\nHe continued down the ledge.  When he reached its base, his suspicions\r\nwere immediately confirmed.  It overhung a cavern, which was not,\r\nhowever, the cave.  To the final rung but one of his ladder he\r\ndescended, and there he rested to have a look about.\r\n\r\nHe was hanging directly before a massive pot-hole in the cliff--a huge,\r\nroughly rounded sort of chamber, the roof of which was arched.  On the\r\nleft, it shared its pitted wall with a second and smaller chamber.  On\r\nthe right, its edge was jaggedly broken against a yawning hole.  This\r\nhole was undoubtedly the cave-mouth described by the documents found in\r\nthe hidden tube.\r\n\r\nFrom this point only, as Grenville could see, would its mouth be\r\nreadily discovered.  Thick curtains of greenery, draped from its\r\nneighboring walls of rock, would shield it from view from passing\r\nboats, unless they should nose to its portals.  This, with a swirling\r\nand dangerous tide, no craft would be likely to attempt.\r\n\r\nThe shrubbery, hanging so thickly from the ledge, afforded Grenville a\r\npuzzle.  He knew it could not be a seaweed, since the tide never rose\r\nto such a level.  He presently realized it was simply an air plant of\r\nunusually luxuriant growth.  Its roots had found lodgment in a crevice,\r\nwhere nothing would be likely to disturb it in its possession.\r\n\r\nConcerning the possible contents of the cave, its extent, or immediate\r\nsurroundings, there was nothing to be discovered from his ladder, twist\r\nas he might or crane his neck to stare in the cavern's mouth.\r\n\r\nHe had practically determined to return to the top, shift his ladder\r\nalong, and once more make the descent, when he realized his effort\r\nwould be wasted.  A thick, broken shelf of the pitted tufa jutted many\r\nfeet out above the cave, and even beyond the growing weed.  Should he\r\nhang his ladder directly before the opening, he would find himself,\r\nwhen he came to its end, swung helplessly over the water.\r\n\r\nHe could see distinctly where the final base of the wall projected into\r\nthe tideway.  It would certainly be no less than ten feet removed from\r\nthe nearest point he could possibly reach by this particular method.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to his mind he could lengthen his strands, drop himself off\r\nthe ladder-end, and swim to the edge of the cave.  But, even as he\r\nturned to examine the physical features afforded to a swimmer, a huge\r\ndark form loafed like a shadow through the crystal tide, to rise beyond\r\nand cut the sparkling surface with a blackish dorsal fin.  There was no\r\nmistaking Mr. Shark.\r\n\r\nGrenville nodded, grimly.  \"Thanks for the timely suggestion,\" he said,\r\nas the monster once more sank.  He presently added, \"It's a boat or no\r\nexplorations.\"  Somewhat disappointedly, he returned up the ladder to\r\nthe top.\r\n\r\n\"The cave is there,\" he told Elaine, who promptly sat down, in sheer\r\nrelief, when she saw him finally safe, \"but it has to be entered from\r\nthe water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Elaine.  \"But why does it have to be entered?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Sidney, at a loss for a better argument, \"it might be full\r\nof treasure;\" and he smiled.\r\n\r\nElaine was no less ready with her answer.  \"Treasure is certainly\r\nindispensable to us here.  No wonder we've felt that something was\r\nstrangely lacking.\"\r\n\r\n\"There you are,\" he rejoined.  \"I think I can paddle the raft about the\r\ncliff, for the tide could never be better.\"\r\n\r\nShe was certain that Grenville attached some unusual importance to an\r\ninspection of the cave.\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't I help?\" she asked him.  \"What was the fault of the ladder?\"\r\n\r\n\"Fully six feet too short.  Perhaps you'd better watch for passing\r\nsteamers.  If we missed one--whom should we blame?\"\r\n\r\nThey had slowly returned to the shelter, where the table was\r\nattractively spread.\r\n\r\n\"What a luncheon!\" said Grenville, enthusiastically.  \"I'll eat in a\r\nrush and be back before you know I've gone.\"  He certainly ate with\r\nlively promise.\r\n\r\nBut, after the raft was launched on the tide, he lost all sense of\r\ntime.  He had left his shoes and stockings on the shore.  He had\r\nbrought a torch, lighted, which he lashed in an upright position on the\r\nraft.  Wading and paddling, punting, pulling, and at times even pushing\r\nhis craft along the beach, he warmed to his work in the briefest space,\r\nsince the tide could hardly have been more favorable to his needs.\r\n\r\nThe pole he had brought had a hook at the end, bound firmly in place\r\nwith copper wire.  This was an excellent provision, especially when he\r\ncame to the cliff, where wading was out of the question.  He was thus\r\nenabled to catch at a ledge, or any open crevice, and draw his unwieldy\r\nfloat along, while fending it off from various rocks on which it might\r\notherwise have pounded.\r\n\r\nHis work was hard and slow.  The distance was not discouraging,\r\nhowever, and with some of the swirls to assist, here and there, he\r\nfinally came to a broken sort of cape, from which he readily saw his\r\ndangling ladder.  After that a hot bit of fighting was required to\r\nmaintain his position near the wall.  The tide was uneasy--a hungry,\r\nugly swirl that alternately came and subsided.\r\n\r\nWhen he passed it at last his task was done, for the cave was a stone's\r\ntoss away.  It was not even then to be seen, and its presence in the\r\ncliff would scarcely have been suspected.  But Grenville knew the\r\nluxuriant plant that grew across a portion of its entrance.  When he\r\npresently moored his raft to a rock fairly under the shadow of the\r\nweed, the cave was just above him.\r\n\r\nUnder his feet the ledge was rough and sloping.  It was pitted so\r\ncompletely as to form a rude natural stairway to the opening under the\r\noverhanging shelf.  This mouth to the cavern was hardly six feet wide\r\nand not more than four in height.  Its access was comparatively easy.\r\n\r\nGrenville, with his torch in hand, was presently gazing within.\r\nObliged to stoop, and beholding nothing but absolute darkness ahead of\r\nhis light, he stumbled against a lumpy vein of rock--and nearly met\r\nwith disaster.  He barely halted at the edge of a pool of ebon water.\r\n\r\nAfter all his effort to gain the cave, it appeared to be filled with\r\nthis inklike accumulation.  The pool was absolutely still.  Not a\r\nripple disturbed its shining surface.  How deep it was and how far it\r\nextended from the ledge that held it from flowing into the sea, could\r\nnot be gauged by Grenville's torch, as he held it aloft to stare at the\r\nwall of velvet gloom.\r\n\r\nHe sounded a note that rolled about and reverberated weirdly.  But he\r\ncould not determine from the echoes how far the waves had traveled.\r\n\r\nCasting his dull-red illumination to the left, and lower down, he\r\nproceeded a little along the ledge, till it merged in an upright wall.\r\nThere was nothing at all to be seen in this direction save water and\r\nrock, that faded away into Stygian darkness beyond.\r\n\r\nHe retraced his steps and explored the ledge on the right.  This led\r\nhim considerably further than the first had done before it was\r\nsimilarly ended.  He was then aware the cavern was of no inconsiderable\r\ndimensions, at least with regard to its width.  He raised his eyes\r\ntowards the ceiling, where nothing was to be seen.\r\n\r\nAt length he bethought him of another test--that of throwing lumps of\r\nrock against the walls.  There were fragments in plenty scattered\r\nloosely at his feet.  The first one he threw went straight out\r\nahead--and presently thumped on something solid.  He reckoned the\r\ndistance some sixty feet away, but admitted it might have been eighty.\r\n\r\nEvery missile he cast right, left, or at an angle promptly reported a\r\nwall; and some plumped back into water.  The cave was not gigantic, but\r\nall its floor was apparently flooded.  His hand, which he thrust in the\r\nwater where he stood, groped blindly and found no bottom.  He rolled up\r\nhis sleeve and tried again, without more definite results.  The water,\r\nhowever, was warm.\r\n\r\n\"Good place for a swim, in any case,\" he told himself, aloud; and,\r\nplanting his torch with a sudden determination that he would not\r\nretreat with information so utterly meager, he stripped off his\r\nclothing at once.  He let himself into the ebon depths, with his torch\r\nheld well above the water.  He had rather expected to be able to wade,\r\nbut he sank to his neck without sounding to the bottom.\r\n\r\nSwimming almost perpendicularly, employing one hand only, he presently\r\nlost all sight of the walls and was out in an unknown pool of\r\nblackness.  Save for a slight sensation of its weirdness, the\r\nexperience was decidedly pleasant.  He tasted the water as he swam and\r\nfound that it was fresh.  He turned to look out at the opening, but\r\ncould barely see light through the weeds.\r\n\r\nSome twenty or thirty feet from the ledge, his feet encountered a\r\nridge.  It was stone, and across it he waded to a greater depth beyond.\r\nYet once again he was soon enabled to stand erect and walk along the\r\nbottom.  The broken, uneven surface that he felt with his feet made his\r\nprogress slow and careful.\r\n\r\nHe had presently crossed the underground pond, up the sloping bank of\r\nwhich he was soon making rapid progress.  He emerged on a dry ledge\r\nbeyond.  Even then the walls were not to be seen till he walked a rod\r\nstraight onward.\r\n\r\nThe briefest examination sufficed to establish the fact he had come to\r\na sort of natural antechamber to the larger cavern he had crossed.\r\nAlso, apparently, the entire place was as empty as a last year's\r\nbird's-nest.\r\n\r\nVaguely disappointed, though he hardly knew why, the man surveyed the\r\nplace anew, by the light that entered at the opening as well as by that\r\nof his torch.  He saw at once that, could it be drained, the place\r\nwould afford a retreat of amazing security for anyone needful of\r\nshelter.  He was also certain he could drain it in a day by blasting\r\nthrough the ledge of rock that blocked the entrance from the sea and so\r\nretained the pool.\r\n\r\nWith one more brief and cursory examination of the rocky structure\r\nabout him, he was turning away when something foreign about a slab of\r\nstone, that seemed a fragment of the solid wall, attracted his\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nHe laid his hand upon its top as if to pull it down.  It came away so\r\nreadily it all but fell on his feet.  Behind it the crudest sort of\r\nmasonry walled up a natural door.\r\n\r\nTen minutes later, standing on the heap of blocks he had tumbled\r\nrapidly down in forming a gap through four feet at least of this\r\nbulkhead, Grenville thrust his torch within a nichelike chamber of the\r\ncavern.\r\n\r\nA low exclamation of astonishment burst from his lips at the vision\r\nthus suddenly encountered.\r\n\r\nThe place was a tomb for dead kings' gold and precious stones that\r\nthrew back the gleams from his torch!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nA DESPERATE CHANCE\r\n\r\nFor fully a minute Grenville was motionless, there in the gap,\r\nsurveying the treasure crypt.\r\n\r\nThe more his eyes became accustomed to the yellowish light and inky\r\nshadows, the more extensive became his estimate of the wealth the cave\r\ncontained.\r\n\r\nThe symbols and trinkets of solid metal and glistening stones were\r\narranged not only on rudely-hewn shelves about the cavern's walls, but\r\nlikewise in several stone receptacles, like sarcophagi in miniature,\r\ncut from the tufa of the island.  It was partially because of this\r\nfeature of the hidden niche that Grenville concluded the property here\r\nhad once belonged to either Indian or African native chiefs and that\r\nthis was a mortuary house of guarded treasure.\r\n\r\nThere was, however, further confirmation of his theory.  This was a\r\ncrude inscription on the wall above the shelves and caskets.  It was\r\nsimply that same cartouch he had found on the map or parchment--once\r\npart of a living being--with the figure of a mummy in the oval.  On\r\neither side of this the beetle or scarab was repeated.\r\n\r\nThe utter inutility of gold and gleaming jewels was momentarily\r\nforgotten as Grenville stared in from the wall.  The island, its\r\nperils--everything save an underlying current of thought that wove\r\nabout Elaine--had ceased for the moment to impress his newly dazzled\r\nsenses.  He withdrew his arm to plant his torch in the stones already\r\nremoved.  Then lustily heaving out stone after stone, like some naked\r\ngod of the underworld, half revealed in the smoky glare, he began to\r\ndemolish the barrier so carefully erected in the cave.\r\n\r\nHe had torn down nearly half the bulk of this uncemented wall, filling\r\nthe larger cavern weirdly full of the crashing and thudding noises,\r\nwhen one of the fragments, tossed unthinkingly behind him, bounded from\r\nanother rock and struck down his torch and its light.\r\n\r\nUtter darkness instantly descended.  He tried to grope his way quickly\r\nforward, thinking the torch might be recovered and blown to a flame\r\nagain.  But he stumbled, fell down upon his knees, and was bruised on\r\nthe stones about his feet.  When he finally found the torch with his\r\nhand, a rock lay squarely upon it; the last of its fire was gone.\r\n\r\nThoroughly disgusted with his carelessness, he stood undecidedly above\r\nthe unseen ruin he had wrought.  To attempt further work of removing\r\nthe wall by the faint diffusion of light that entered from the outside\r\nworld, was out of the question.  To enter the crypt before the aperture\r\ncould be considerably enlarged was equally impossible.  Moreover, the\r\ntreasure was safe, as he presently admitted.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, he began to realize at last how futile had been\r\nhis labor.  He remembered, abruptly, where he was, the details of his\r\nhelpless situation.  Except as something to show Elaine, or to load her\r\nwith as presents, the stuff in the cave was as worthless as so much\r\ndross.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to do but retreat as he had come.  This he presently\r\ndid, reluctantly turning from the half-uncovered cavern and wading into\r\nthe pool.\r\n\r\nWithout his torch, and swimming towards the light, he was now enabled,\r\nto some extent, to discern the limits of the cave.  He could see a\r\nportion of the ceiling and a bit of the wall on his left.  Both were\r\nfeatureless, to all appearances.  The water's surface presented a more\r\nextensive aspect with the light thus spread before him, but its farther\r\nlimits could not be descried, where its inkiness blended with the gloom.\r\n\r\nWhen he came at length to the ledge that formed a natural dam across\r\nthe entrance, thereby impounding the water, he looked it over with\r\ngreater care than when he had first trod upon it, to determine where\r\nwould be the likeliest spot for a blast to break it down.\r\n\r\nThere could be no debate upon this subject.  Over against the upright\r\nwall, on the left-hand side looking out, the ledge not only narrowed\r\ndown, where a pot-hole pitted it deeply, but a tiny crevice extended so\r\nnearly through the remaining substance that a trickle of water already\r\noozed downward towards the sea.  The perpendicular wall here also was\r\nbroken, a number of fragments of exceptional size appearing so loose as\r\nto threaten toppling over.\r\n\r\nGrenville was leisurely in all this examination.  He was either obliged\r\nto permit his body to dry in the air or dress while dripping wet.  Yet\r\nat length he was once more clothed and ready to depart.  He remained\r\nfor a moment, taking a final survey of the place and planning the\r\ndetails of his blasting operations, then stooped and made his exit from\r\nthe place.\r\n\r\nThe brilliant light of outer day bewildered him momentarily.  He stared\r\nbelow, however, as if he felt he might be blind.  The raft was not\r\nwhere he had left it.\r\n\r\nHastily scrambling down the incline of the ledge, he promptly arrived\r\nat its base.  His view was limited, even then, to a segment of the\r\nopen, purple sea.  But the worst of his fears was confirmed.  The raft\r\nhad floated away.  It was nowhere to be seen!\r\n\r\nThe tide had run out with amazing swiftness.  Its level was such that\r\nthe ceaseless swells ran under his ledge, instead of up about it.  The\r\ncreeper-cord, which he had utilized to moor his craft to the bowlders,\r\nhung uselessly over the edge.  It had parted at once when the ponderous\r\nraft had been caught in the swirl of an eddy.\r\n\r\nThis eddy was running intermittently, as Grenville soon discovered.\r\nDisgust with himself for his carelessness, and a vague disquiet\r\nconcerning his helpless situation, addressed his comprehension\r\ntogether.  He was bounded by huge overhanging walls and a water\r\nabounding in sharks.  If only by boat could the cavern be reached, then\r\nonly by boat----\r\n\r\nHe thought of his ladder, dangling in air where he had left it, and\r\nbelieved for a second he could hook it in with his pole, still lying on\r\nthe rocks.  But no sooner had he climbed a little up the ledge, to a\r\npoint from which the ladder could be seen, than he realized the folly\r\nof his hope.  It was twenty feet off at the least, and fully eight\r\nabove the water.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the tide was continuing to fall, that the raft had\r\ndoubtless departed the island forever, and that night might find him\r\nhere, a helpless prisoner, was no great motive for alarm.  But\r\nGrenville was not slow to realize that escape from his predicament\r\nwould be no more readily accomplished on the morrow than it could\r\nto-day--that high tide and low tide were alike of no avail to return\r\nhim to the terrace and Elaine.\r\n\r\nThe thought of Elaine and the fears she must certainly experience, did\r\nhe fail to return that night, aroused a new impatience in his blood.\r\nHe could almost have made up his mind to slip overboard at once and\r\ntake his chances of swimming about the base of the wall, despite its\r\ntreacherous currents, had he not remembered the sharks.\r\n\r\n\"It's the ladder--or night,\" he murmured, paraphrasing Wellington's\r\nutterance at Waterloo, somewhat grimly, and again he went down to the\r\nedge of the shelf of rock left dripping by the tide.\r\n\r\n\"Elaine!\" he called, with a lusty breath, yet without an accent of\r\ndistress.  \"Elaine! ... Elaine! ... Are you there?\"\r\n\r\nThere was no response, save the swashing of the waves, which he knew\r\nwere constantly retreating, leaving the ladder yet more high above the\r\nheaving surface.\r\n\r\nOnce more he shouted as before, perhaps a trifle louder.  And again he\r\nheard no reply.  He began to fear the shelf of rock that projected out\r\nabove him might send the sound waves too far outwards, towards the sea,\r\nfor Elaine on the terrace to hear.\r\n\r\nHe had no alternative but to shout repeatedly.  This he did, at regular\r\nintervals, all the time striving to eliminate the slightest accent that\r\nwould rouse her sense of fear.  It seemed, however, as if no sort of\r\ncry could bring a response from the top.  He moved to another position\r\nat last and tried with a longer, shriller tone.\r\n\r\n\"Yes!  Yes!\" came a bright, clear call, at last.  \"Can you hear me now\r\nany better?\"\r\n\r\nShe had answered before, as he instantly knew, but her voice had been\r\nsnatched afar from the cliff by a circular current of wind.\r\n\r\n\"All right!\" shouted Grenville, enormously relieved.  \"I'm down here\r\nbelow and I'd rather return by the ladder.  Can you hear me quite\r\ndistinctly?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes!\" cried Elaine, whose fears were vast, though she would not\r\nbetray them in her voice.  \"Do you want me to change it--or something?\"\r\n\r\n\"A trifle, yes--as I'll direct you.\"  He paused for a moment to make\r\nhis directions as clear and concise as possible.  Then he shouted:\r\n\r\n\"First move a few of the rocks to a point as near the edge as possible\r\nand about ten feet to the left of the present position....  Is that\r\nclear?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--very clear--quite clear----  And then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then lift off the others and remove the ladder--carefully.  Mind it's\r\njust a bit heavy.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, and she cried: \"Yes!  I hear you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Take the ladder at once to the rocks already placed and roll them on\r\nits end, to hold it down.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then heap all the others upon it?\"  Her question came ringing down the\r\ncliff.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--and as promptly----  But don't overtax your strength.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no reply to this final instruction.  That the quickest of\r\naction was highly essential, she had felt in the very air.  She was\r\nhotly, valiantly tugging at the rocks before his last words had died\r\nupon the breeze.\r\n\r\nHe presently saw the ladder-end jerk about spasmodically and ascend for\r\nperhaps a foot.  Elaine had the weight of it in her hands--and her\r\nstrength was equal to the task!\r\n\r\nHe watched it, his heart wildly thrilling at the thought of her ready\r\nwit and courage--her certain, sturdy helpfulness in every trying crisis.\r\n\r\nWith more wild gyrations about the ledge, the ladder-end now\r\ndisappeared.  It was gone for a moment only, to return at a point more\r\ndirectly above his head.  Here it halted, moved about uncertainly, then\r\nlowered jerkily downward, to dangle at last with its last rung all but\r\non the water, some eight or ten feet away.  He knew that its upper end\r\nwas lightly anchored and would soon be firmly held in place.\r\n\r\nHe caught up his pole, with the hook at its end, to fish the ladder\r\ninward.  But, fearing that any untimely tug might fetch it all doubling\r\ndown the cliff, he instantly halted the maneuver and compelled himself\r\nto wait.\r\n\r\nFive minutes went by--five ages for slowness of movement.  He was\r\ncertain by then Elaine had made the end too secure to be readily\r\ndislodged.  He stepped to the outermost edge of the shelf, with the\r\npole horizontally extended.\r\n\r\nIt was short by perhaps six inches.  Strain as he would, he could not\r\nreach either one of the rungs or supports.  A light puff of wind then\r\nbent it slightly inward, and he fished out wildly, in the hope the\r\ndiscrepancy thus amended might be wholly overcome.\r\n\r\nBut his hook still prodded the empty air, while the zephyrs that played\r\nwith the dangling thing seemed solely bent on his torture.  The sweat\r\noozed out on his temples, for the straining made him warm.  A sense of\r\ndisappointment amounting almost to despair attacked him for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"I shall leap out and swim!\" he told himself, at last.  \"I'll not\r\nremain here for the night!\"\r\n\r\nHe returned to the point from which Elaine had finally been heard.\r\n\r\nShe did not immediately answer when he called as he had before.  When\r\nher voice came down, he was certain her breath was broken.\r\n\r\n\"I've--carried the last rock--over--and one or two--extra, besides.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right ho!\" responded Grenville, cheerfully.  \"You might stand away\r\nwhile I test it.\"\r\n\r\nHe knew that a sudden throwing of his weight upon the ladder might\r\nsuffice to fetch it down.  He could not be sure that, with all her\r\nready helpfulness and promptness, Elaine had so heaped the rocks above\r\nas to make the thing secure.\r\n\r\n\"I can always get back here for the night,\" he murmured to himself, as\r\nhe scanned the swirl below.  \"And when it calms down from that bally\r\ntwist----\"\r\n\r\nThe whirlpool was even then subsiding, in its intermittent way.  He\r\nquickly ascended the sloping ledge, the better to run and leap far\r\noutward.  His pole he dropped upon the rocks as he hung there poised\r\nfor his plunge.  His eyes were keenly fixed on the tide.\r\n\r\nThe waters became quiescent.  Swiftly Grenville darted down the ledge,\r\nleaping well out, towards the end of the ladder.  He was fairly in\r\nmidair when his gaze was directed to a dark form loafing in the depths.\r\n\r\nBefore he struck, by some quick flirt the huge form rose, coming\r\ninward, and a black fin cut through the waves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nA DREADED VISITOR\r\n\r\nWhat it was that happened when he felt the waters swiftly rising all\r\nabout him Grenville could never have told.  He was almost certain his\r\nfoot had come in contact with a heavy, pulpy surface, like a wet thing\r\nmade of rubber, as he did his utmost to strike his assailant with his\r\nheel.\r\n\r\nHe could only be certain that he seemed to plunge downward\r\ninterminably, and that afterwards a horrible rush of waters, lashed to\r\nviolence, was sounding wildly in his ears and confusing his staring\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nThen he came to the top with a sickening conviction, that one of his\r\nlegs would be gone almost before he could feel the incisions of the\r\nteeth where the shark was closing upon it.  He lurched tremendously\r\nforward in the water, to close the short but vital gap between himself\r\nand the ladder.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him then a nightmare must be binding his limbs to\r\ninaction--that incredible time was elapsing while he still remained in\r\nthe tide.  As a matter of fact, he had moved with prodigious energy,\r\nhis strokes and velocity through the water phenomenally swift.  And,\r\nwhen he caught at the lowermost rung, he shot from the depths like some\r\nweirdly living projectile, doubled up in a knot by its speed.\r\n\r\nFor his knees were drawn sharply upward, and hand over hand he scaled\r\nup his swaying support.  But his ears heard the hiss where that\r\nterrible fin was cutting the waves beneath him.  One quick glance he\r\nsped to the place comprehended the turning monster's belly, the open\r\nmouth, and even the hideous nose that shot beneath his very foot like\r\nthe point of a speeding torpedo.\r\n\r\nTo the round above he scrambled no less galvanically--only to feel a\r\nsudden giving of the ladder.  A wild conviction of the structure's\r\ninsecurity above--its giving way beneath the incautious strain he had\r\nunavoidably put upon it--scorched its way into his brain, while he\r\nstill looked down upon the shark.\r\n\r\nBut that one slip ended as abruptly as it had come.  It was all in the\r\nrung he had clutched in desperate violence, and not in the ladder\r\nitself.  Elaine's rock anchorage was firm!\r\n\r\nA swift and weakening reaction now ensued in all his being, as he clung\r\nthere, dripping but safe.  He leaned on the ladder-rung heavily, to\r\nregain his breath and strength.  He was panting and all but exhausted\r\nfor the moment.  When at length he resumed the upward climb, the shark\r\nwas no longer to be seen.\r\n\r\nHe paused a bit longer on the shelving ledge above to gather his wits\r\nin proper order.\r\n\r\n\"Sidney!\" he heard.  \"Are you coming?  Are you there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, rather!\" he called out, cheerily.  \"Stopped like a kid\r\nto--examine the geological formation.\"  He started upward promptly,\r\nwhistling as he went.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, without a tremendous effort that he finally pulled\r\nhimself over the brink, in all the weight of his soaking garments, and\r\nstruggled to his feet.\r\n\r\n\"Why--you're wet!\" said Elaine, concealing her hands, which were cut\r\nand bruised from the heavy stones she had carried.  \"Did you have to\r\nswim to get the ladder?\"\r\n\r\nHe knew her hands were hurt, but maintained his usual manner.\r\n\r\n\"I did.  But the water is warm--in fact, it was very warm, indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"But couldn't you use the raft?\"\r\n\r\n\"I couldn't,\" he answered, candidly.  \"The raft got away while I was\r\npothering about, and, unless it faithfully floats ashore, we may never\r\nsee its honest face again.\"\r\n\r\nElaine's expression brightened.\r\n\r\n\"I'm perfectly delighted to hear it!  Now you never can go there again!\"\r\n\r\nGrenville was amused at the turn of her reflections.\r\n\r\n\"But what about the treasure in the crypt?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe there's any treasure in the crypt.  There never is,\r\nexcept in wonderful stories.  And, if there was, what good could it be\r\nto us?\"\r\n\r\nGrenville met her magnetic gaze, now brightened by her challenge.  It\r\nwas not a time to excite new alarms in her heart by divulging the facts\r\nhe had discovered.  For she would be alarmed were she once informed of\r\nthe wealth concealed beneath their feet.  She would instantly\r\nunderstand the dangers to them both from the men who had hidden the\r\ntreasure.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" he said, with an air of lightness he was very far from feeling,\r\n\"I confess I'd rather have a good pot of steaming black coffee at this\r\nparticular juncture than all the gold and jewels of the land.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, please don't mention it!\" said Elaine.  \"Haven't I tried every\r\nleaf I could find, to make you something to drink?\"  And a wistful\r\npucker came to her brow that made her more than ever enchanting.\r\n\"You've no idea,\" she added, \"what horrid messes this island foliage\r\ncan make.\"\r\n\r\n\"Wouldn't wonder,\" said Grenville, calmly.  But, having come to the\r\nshaded cave, he was grateful for a drink of cool, sweet water and glad\r\nto sit down for a rest.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the cave was dropped, but his thoughts could not fade in\r\nGrenville's mind.  They lay in substrata, beneath more homely plans for\r\nresuming his interrupted labors.  But, beyond going down to dig some\r\nyams to roast with a pheasant killed the previous day, he returned to\r\nno toils that afternoon.  He paused to examine the shell of his boat,\r\nwhich fire, plus his chisel, was finally evolving from the log, and,\r\nfinding unusual quantities of blackly charred stuff to be gouged away\r\nin the morning, determined to be early at the task.\r\n\r\nThis plan was one of the sort that \"gang aglee.\"  He fished, with\r\nElaine, till nine o'clock the following day, to provide a needful\r\nchange of their diet; then placed some fresh signals on their flagpole.\r\nAt eleven, however, he was once more at his boat, with his fires\r\nfreshly blazing.  He was working gayly, aroused to a new enthusiasm\r\nover final results to be achieved by the excellent progress his former\r\nfires had made upon the log.  A few more days of work like that--and he\r\nwould have to be thinking of the launching.\r\n\r\nThis was not a thought he had neglected.  In a vague sort of way the\r\nproblem of moving his boat to the water's edge had bothered him from\r\nthe first.  It would have to be run on rollers, he admitted.  Doubtless\r\na way would have to be cleared through some of the undergrowth.\r\n\r\nReflecting that this was a task to be performed while the fires were\r\ndoing their daily stint, he made a preliminary survey of the jungle to\r\nselect the most practical route.  The way across the grassy clearing\r\nwas not only long, but in places inclined to be rough.  Fortunately, in\r\neither direction the way was all down-grade.\r\n\r\nHe had never yet forced a way to the shore through the jungle beyond\r\nhis tree-trunk smelter.  Thither he wended his way to note what this\r\nroute might offer.\r\n\r\nBreaking the branches from before his path, and rather inclined to\r\nbelieve a trail might once have been forced through the thicket, he was\r\npenetrating deeper and deeper into the moist and thickly shaded region\r\nwhen he presently halted, almost certain he had heard someone calling\r\nhis name.\r\n\r\n\"Sidney!  Sidney!\" came the cry again, from Elaine up above him on the\r\ncliff.  \"Sidney!  Where are you?  A boat!  I've seen a sail!  There's\r\nsomeone coming at last!\"\r\n\r\nHe had smashed his way out while she was calling.\r\n\r\n\"A sail!\" she repeated, excitedly, the moment he appeared.  \"Oh,\r\ncome!--please come at once!\"\r\n\r\nShe disappeared swiftly from the edge, running back, lest the sight be\r\nlost forever.\r\n\r\nActively, Grenville went bounding across the clearing and up their\r\nnarrow trail.  He was panting and eager when Elaine ran forward to meet\r\nhim, and clutched him by the arm.\r\n\r\n\"I knew it would come!--I knew it!\" she cried, as she hastened hotly\r\nforward at his side.  \"We must wave things as hard as we can!\"\r\n\r\nShe had guided him swiftly to the great lone tree that stood like the\r\nisland's landmark, to be seen for many a mile.  She pointed in triumph\r\nafar across the sea--and Grenville beheld a tiny sail, like the merest\r\nwhite notch in the sky.\r\n\r\n\"Can they see us yet?  Shall we wave?\" said Elaine.  \"They couldn't go\r\nby and miss us now?\"\r\n\r\nShe was still clinging fast to Grenville's arm, and tears had sprung to\r\nher eyes.  What long, long hours of torture, anxiety, and hope she had\r\nexpended, uttering no complaint as the days went by, the man abruptly\r\nknew.  Then something indescribably poignant shot boltlike through his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nElaine felt him harden, grow rigid, as his gaze narrowed down on the\r\ndistant thing she had found in their purple sea.  The note that broke\r\nfrom his lips at last made a shiver go down her spine.\r\n\r\nHe suddenly turned, and his arm was wrenched from her clasp.  He sped\r\nlike a madman back to their mast and heaved all his weight against it.\r\nHe threw back the rocks that held it in place in the crevice to which\r\nit had been fitted.\r\n\r\nBefore she could follow, to question what he did, Elaine saw him drop\r\nthe pole over.\r\n\r\n\"Sidney!\" she said, but the face that he turned wore a look that was\r\nnew to her ken.\r\n\r\n\"Pull up the ladder from the rocks!\" he called.  \"Then go to the\r\nshelter and stay!\"\r\n\r\nHe himself ran to the cavern, to take up their largest jug of water.\r\nWith this in his arms, he hastened down the trail to quench the flames\r\nbeneath his boat.\r\n\r\nAnd when, with more water, hurried from the spring, he had drowned the\r\nlast blue wisp of smoke, he brought the full jug to the cave again and\r\ntore down the improvised awning.\r\n\r\n\"We had better hail death than that craft!\" he said, \"unless I am very\r\nmuch mistaken!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nAN IRREPARABLE LOSS\r\n\r\nElaine was dumbly appalled for a moment by the words that Grenville had\r\nuttered.  She finally found her voice.\r\n\r\n\"But--why?  I don't believe I understand.  It isn't someone--some\r\nhorrible men who hunt human heads for trophies?\"\r\n\r\nGrenville was glad she knew what a head-hunter means.  He loathed the\r\nnecessity of making revolting explanations.  He vainly wished he might\r\nspare her now--that his judgment might be in error.  But the rakish\r\nangle of that sail, though so far away on the water, had left him no\r\nroom to doubt that natives were manning the craft.\r\n\r\n\"They may be friendly visitors, after all,\" he answered.  \"And then\r\nagain they may not.  It may be as wise for us to see them first, and\r\ndetermine our conduct later.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do fear them, then?  But how can we hide--if they land and come up\r\non the hill?\"\r\n\r\n\"They shall never come up--if I can help it!  If I only had a few more\r\nbombs!\"  He had gone to his cave and was dragging forth his little\r\ncannon.  \"I haven't even a hatful of slugs with which to charge this\r\nplaything!\"\r\n\r\nElaine had remained obediently at her shelter, in the door of which she\r\nstood.\r\n\r\n\"Won't they see you?\" she said, her voice already lowered, as if in\r\nfear its accents might be overheard where the distant boat was\r\napproaching.  \"Have you more old pieces of brass?\"\r\n\r\n\"Some,\" said Grenville, reluctant to use his remaining metal in such an\r\nextravagant manner.  \"I have nothing else that will answer, hang the\r\nluck! ... They can't see us yet, but we'll move about with caution....\r\nI wish I had made more powder!  I have only a few feet of fuse.  I must\r\nget some additional creepers at once and let them dry out in the sun.\"\r\n\r\nHe went down to the jungle immediately for a fresh supply of this\r\nhighly essential growth, leaving Elaine at the shelter, a prey to dread\r\nthat had utterly obliterated her bitter disappointment.  She stooped,\r\nto steal forward on the rocks and look for the sail again.  It was\r\nstill so far on the sun-lit surface of the ocean that it seemed no\r\nnearer than before.  She returned once more to the cave.\r\n\r\nGrenville came up, fairly laden with freshly severed creepers.\r\n\r\n\"I've thought of a means for making bombs!\" he told her, triumphantly.\r\n\"Perhaps you can split these creepers and take out the cores while I go\r\nto fetch some bamboo poles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't I fill them with powder?\" Elaine inquired, anxiously.  \"I\r\nwatched you before.  I am sure I would make no great mistakes.\"\r\n\r\nHe knew she was nervous, eager to be employed.\r\n\r\n\"Sure shot you could,\" he answered, briskly, and, going to the cave\r\nemployed as his \"powder magazine,\" he brought her a jar of explosive.\r\n\"Don't be afraid to put in all that the creeper tube will carry,\" he\r\ninstructed.  \"And tie it with fibers here and there, to keep the edges\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\nWith his heaviest tools he descended at once to the bamboo growth,\r\nwhere he was presently toiling hard.  Elaine, no less industriously,\r\nwas hotly assailing the creepers, held firmly down with heavy rocks, to\r\nmake their manipulation easy.\r\n\r\nShe had filled and bound a considerable length of this simply\r\nmanufactured fuse when Grenville returned to the terrace.  For his\r\npart, he bore across his shoulder three great long steins of green\r\nbamboo that were three inches through at the base.\r\n\r\n\"I can cut this stuff at its divisions,\" he explained, \"fill the\r\nsmaller sections with powder, and fit the larger ones over them, like a\r\nshell within a shell.  A natural growth plugs each one up at the end,\r\nand I'll also cap each end with a rock, and wrap the whole contraption\r\nabout with creepers.  Of course, the fuse will go in first.  I wish the\r\nstuff were dry!\"\r\n\r\nThe spirit of battle was no less aroused in Elaine, whose mood was the\r\nequal of his own.\r\n\r\n\"Couldn't we use the cannon first--keep them off with that while the\r\nfuses and things are drying?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's our only chance, if they raid us by the trail.  They can scarcely\r\narrive for two or three hours more.  The tide will be against them----\r\nIf we keep out of sight, they may not detect our presence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anyway,\" added Elaine, sagely, \"they needn't know how few we are in\r\nnumbers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Right ho!\" he answered, cheerily.  \"The trail is steep and narrow.  We\r\ncan train the gun to rake its entire width.  For the second shot, and\r\nany succeeding charges, we can load the piece with stones----  I'm in\r\nhopes our visitors may not land, but we'll keep our fire smoldering,\r\nmaking no smoke; and I'll fetch all the fruit and water we may need for\r\na couple of days.\"\r\n\r\nElaine looked up at him quickly.\r\n\r\n\"A couple of days?  We may have to fight two days?\"\r\n\r\nGrenville smiled, suggestively.\r\n\r\n\"Not if they come within range of the cannon or linger about a bomb.\r\nIn time of peace prepare for the worst--and then a little extra.\"\r\n\r\nHe moved out cautiously, as Elaine had done, to scan the distant sail.\r\nHe could see that it was steadily approaching.  With eager impatience\r\nhe hastened below to lay in needful provisions.\r\n\r\nLuncheon was forgotten.  When a large supply of fruits and water, with\r\nfuel sufficient for perhaps a week of flameless fire, had been stored\r\nin the coolness and protection of the caves, Grenville immediately set\r\nto work constructing the shells to fill with powder.\r\n\r\nThis was a task involving much difficult cutting.  For this employment\r\nhis tools were not encouragingly suited.  Of fuse, Elaine had finally\r\nproduced as much as all his bombs would require, with lengths for the\r\ncannon as well.\r\n\r\nThe gun was finally charged and primed, after Grenville had rebound it\r\nto its \"carriage.\"  It was lodged in the rocks, where it covered the\r\ntrail, and stones were piled abundantly about it.  A fuse was laid to\r\nthe vent.\r\n\r\nFrom time to time both the exiles had crept towards the one lone tree\r\non the wall, to observe the on-coming boat.  By three o'clock of the\r\nafternoon the wind had practically failed, but the craft drifted slowly\r\nforward.  It was plainly in sight by then--a fair-sized affair with a\r\nsingular out-rigger and a queer, unmistakable sail.  So far as\r\nGrenville could determine at the distance, there were three or four\r\nnatives aboard.\r\n\r\n\"If none of them ever go back to tell the tale,\" he announced, a bit\r\ngrimly to Elaine, \"we may be all right for quite a time.\"\r\n\r\nShe understood at once.\r\n\r\n\"You think, if they leave, they may return here later--with a larger\r\nforce--if they find we are ready for a fight?\"\r\n\r\n\"If they do, we'll not be at home--provided the boat can be finished.\"\r\n\r\nElaine was evidently thinking much--of the battle that might presently\r\nensue, with all its unknown results.\r\n\r\n\"They'd kill us if they could, I suppose, if only to cut----  They are\r\nnot human beings, really--the kind we ought not to shoot?\"\r\n\r\nGrenville could hardly repress a smile.\r\n\r\n\"If they try to steal the gun, I think we'd be justified in firing.  At\r\nany rate, I shall fire first and debate the question later.\"\r\n\r\nElaine was growing nervous, now that all they could do was practically\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I wish it was over!\" she declared.  \"Do you think they'll attack\r\nus soon after landing?\"\r\n\r\n\"They may not land this evening.\"\r\n\r\nGrenville was thinking of the tidal sounds that haunted the island's\r\nwall.  These were still of considerable volume every day, and,\r\naccording to his theory, frightened the ignorant natives away.  He\r\nadded, presently: \"You see, they may be aware the tiger was living here\r\nbefore we disturbed his possession.  In that event they might be\r\ncautious of landing after dark.  They rarely take chances, I believe,\r\nby attacking in the night.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose they arrive an hour or two before sunset?\"\r\n\r\n\"They might, if the breeze should freshen....  We can only wait and\r\nsee.\"\r\n\r\nBut this waiting was an irritating business, so slowly did the craft\r\nappear to move against the tide and so fraught with possibilities was\r\nits visit to the place.\r\n\r\nSitting or stooping behind the rocks, Elaine and Grenville kept a\r\nconstant watchfulness on the boat, now less than half a mile away.  It\r\nwas apparently becalmed.  The day grew old and still it came no nearer.\r\n\r\nThe sun at length departed from the scene, with the riddle still\r\nunsolved.  It appeared to Grenville the day-end breath would have\r\nwafted the stranger to the shore.  He thought perhaps it did approach\r\nconsiderably closer, but of this he was not at all certain.\r\n\r\nThe brief, soft twilight soon began to wane.  At Sidney's suggestion,\r\ntheir simple repast of island fruits was eaten.  The fish they had\r\ncaptured in the morning was not cooked, in the absence of the customary\r\nfire.  The calm that settled on the \"Isle of Shalimar\" was far from\r\nbeing reassuring.  It seemed fraught with silent agencies of fate,\r\nmoving noiselessly about the shadowed jungle.\r\n\r\nWhen the darkness came down, the mysterious craft was no longer to be\r\nseen.  Grenville had fancied it drifting rapidly in when he last\r\ndiscerned its form.  No lights were displayed upon its mast or deck to\r\nindicate its presence off the headland.\r\n\r\nElaine was persuaded at last to retire, though she knew she should not\r\nsleep.  Grenville remained on guard alone, pacing back and forth from\r\nthe head of the trail to the lone tree reared above the cliff.  His\r\nsenses were strained to catch the slightest sound, but none came upward\r\nfrom the sea.  From time to time he halted by their smoldering bit of\r\ncoals to assure himself the last of the sparks had not been permitted\r\nto die.\r\n\r\nAt length, far in the silent night, the tidal wailing began, its\r\nweirdness increased an hundredfold by the tension of the hours.  It\r\nseemed to Grenville unusually loud, so acute had the darkness made his\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the final note died out on the gently stirring air than\r\nanswering cries, no less weird and shrill, arose from out upon the\r\nwater.  The visiting craft had drifted past the headland and was\r\nsomewhere off on Grenville's right.  The cries from its deck were like\r\na response to some spirit of the island.  They were rather more awed\r\nthan exultant, Grenville felt, and he fancied some chanting, that came\r\nto him brokenly out of the heavy shades of night, was possibly a prayer.\r\n\r\nWhen he came before her shelter again, Elaine was standing in the door.\r\nShe had heard the cries from the boat.\r\n\r\n\"They haven't landed yet?\" she said, in a whisper.\r\n\r\n\"They won't land now till daybreak, and perhaps not then,\" he answered.\r\n\"Go back--and go to sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll try,\" said Elaine, and disappeared.\r\n\r\nFor Grenville, however, there could be no sleep, though the darkness\r\nrendered up no further sound.  Like the outer sentry of a picket-line,\r\nwith the enemy close, and his whereabouts unknown, he glided silently\r\nfrom one dark edge of the terrace to another, as the hours wore on,\r\nalert for the slightest alarm.\r\n\r\nHe finally sat by the head of the trail, convinced that the visitors\r\nwould give him no trouble till morning, yet guarding the only way by\r\nwhich they could gain the summit of the hill.\r\n\r\nHe was weary and doubtless he nodded, lulled by the softness of the\r\nbreeze that came up at last, burdened with its ozone from the sea.\r\nAnd, despite the fact he was afterwards positive the nod was the\r\nbriefest in the world, full daylight was spread to the ends of the\r\nworld, and the sun was gilding the island's tufa walls, when at length\r\nhe started to his feet.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to him then some sound from below had played through the\r\nfabric of his dream.  But nothing disturbed the usual calm, save the\r\nmorning cry of distant parrots.  Stooping, he moved through the\r\nscattered rocks, to survey the waters far and wide.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to be seen, in all that expanse, of the craft that\r\nhad ridden near at midnight.  All the round of the wall he made in this\r\nmanner of caution.  When he came at length above the blackened\r\nclearing, where for day after day he had toiled with fire and chisel,\r\nhe gazed about the open space bewildered and incredulous.\r\n\r\nHis half-finished boat was gone!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nAFTER TO-MORROW----\r\n\r\nThe truth of his loss was hardly to be credited as Grenville continued\r\nto stare below where the hollowed log had been.\r\n\r\nThere was not a sign of a living thing in the clearing or near-by\r\njungle.  There had been no sounds of unusual movement in the thicket,\r\nhe was sure, or otherwise he must have wakened.  No voices had spoken,\r\nsince his ears had all but ached to catch the slightest disturbance.\r\n\r\nOn the blue of the sea, so tremendously expanded from this particular\r\npoint of vantage, there was not a hint of a sail.  But the fact\r\nremained his boat was gone, with all the work it represented, and all\r\nthe hope their situation had centered upon it for them both.\r\n\r\nAn utter sinking of the heart assailed him.  His moment of sleep, he\r\ntold himself, could have been no more treacherous had it been planned\r\nby a scheming enemy to complete their abandonment to some rapidly\r\nimpending fate.  And yet had he waked in the gray of the dawn, with his\r\nbombs and fuses still too damp for employment, and his cannon planted\r\nonly to guard the trail, the boat could hardly have been saved.  At\r\nmost, his protest would merely have betrayed the fact he was camped\r\nthere on the terrace.\r\n\r\nA new line of thought sprang into his brain, as one suggestion after\r\nanother was swiftly deduced from his loss.  The natives who had landed\r\nand carried off his precious craft must certainly have found the wall\r\nwith which he had barred the trail.  He could hardly doubt they knew of\r\nhis presence on the hill.  They might even now be lying in wait to get\r\nhim the moment he appeared.\r\n\r\nHis preconceived theory, that they dared not land while those tidal\r\nsounds still haunted this end of the island, received a shattering\r\nblow.  Their craft was doubtless hidden now behind either one of the\r\nother lofty walls comprised by the neighboring hills.  The thieves had\r\ncut off all possible hope of his escape with Elaine by means of his\r\nsolid, if crude, canoe, and could finally starve them on the hill, if\r\nthey had no courage for a battle.\r\n\r\nYet how had they happened on his boat and why had they removed it?\r\nThat they must have carried it bodily down to the shore, through the\r\njungle, was absolutely certain.  And this, he thought, argued a\r\nhalf-dozen men, though it might have been done by four.\r\n\r\nHe remained there, stunned by this utterly defeating discovery,\r\nwatching the thicket for the slightest sign that might betray the\r\npresence of the enemy and revolving the proposition over and over in\r\nhis mind.  When at last he admitted that the natives might have known\r\nthe log was lying there, if they had not indeed prepared it with fire\r\nfor some of their uses the previous year, he was more than verging on\r\nthe facts.  They had felled it solely for a boat--and much of their\r\nwork he had completed.\r\n\r\nThis line of reasoning did not, however, serve to quiet further\r\nquestions.  The visitors must certainly have wondered how it came about\r\nthat the log was so nearly hollowed.  The clay, still plastered upon\r\nit, must have suggested to their minds the work of a craftsman minus\r\ntools.  That the workman must be present on the island would be more\r\nthan suspected, since his boat was not even launched.\r\n\r\nThey might suppose the tiger had captured and devoured him--always\r\nadmitting they knew of the brute's former presence on the place.  It\r\nseemed far more likely to Grenville they had found his tracks about the\r\nspring, his gate on the trail, and the signs of his recent fires and\r\ngeneral activity about the region of his smelter, and would therefore\r\nconclude he was still encamped on the hill.\r\n\r\nHe could fancy a half-dozen pairs of maliciously glittering eyes\r\nfastened even now upon the crest and edges of the terrace, all hidden\r\nby the thickets.  Had the poisoned dart from a blowpipe come winging\r\nswiftly up from the shadows of the foliage, he should not have been\r\nsurprised.\r\n\r\nBut not a leaf below him was disturbed.  Not a sound arose to warn his\r\neager ears.  With a sense of bitter rage and humiliation in all his\r\nsystem, he finally crept once more to the trail, and beyond it to the\r\ncliff's final shelving.\r\n\r\nFrom this extremity of the heights new aspects of the island were in\r\nview, as well as different expanses of the sea.  His keen eyes searched\r\nthe jungle and the clearings first, with no more results than before.\r\n\r\nIt was not until he gazed afar, on the darkening silver of the waters,\r\nthat his search was at all rewarded.  Even then, for a moment he was\r\nnot wholly convinced that what he saw was not a spearlike leaf of\r\nfoliage projected beyond the clean-cut edge of the farthest of the\r\nisland's tufa towers.\r\n\r\nBut the angle of color detached itself and receded in far perspective.\r\nIt was plainly the sail of the visiting craft, previously hidden from\r\nhis sight by the hill at the island's end.  It was already far on a\r\nnorthern course, where he should not have thought to find it.  The\r\nfreshening breeze was heeling it over gracefully; it would vanish in\r\nless than half an hour.\r\n\r\nHe wondered instantly--had they towed away his boat?  Or might they\r\nhave left it moored in some inlet of the island, to be taken upon some\r\nfuture visit?\r\n\r\nStifling an impulse to hasten down the trail, and aware that one, or\r\neven more, of the natives might have been left concealed upon the\r\nplace, to ambush himself and Elaine, or anyone else suspected of being\r\npresent on the rock, he remained behind his barrier of stones, no less\r\ncautious than before.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the entire morning passed in apparent security, with\r\nnever the flicker of a leaf below to advertise a lurking menace, could\r\nnot suffice to render Grenville careless or overconfident.  He had told\r\nElaine of their loss--which worried her less than himself.  Together\r\nthey maintained an all-day vigilance, half expectant of the\r\nsailing-craft's return and keyed to the highest tension of expectancy\r\nat every stirring of a shrub below them in the jungle.\r\n\r\nGrenville finally armed himself with his bow and straightest arrow, to\r\ndescend the trail, go quietly over to the spring, and then to the spot\r\nfrom which his boat had vanished.  About the pool of crystal water\r\nthere was not so much as a track of human boots or feet, other than his\r\nown.  There were none to be seen about the foot of the trail, where\r\nthere was ample dust in which they might have been recorded.\r\n\r\nWhere his boat had lain, with its end on a rock, there were far fewer\r\nfootprints in the ash and soil than Sidney could have believed\r\npossible, judging the visitors at only four in number and their task\r\nnot particularly light.  Apparently, however, they had landed down\r\nbeyond the jungle, proceeded straight to the log, and, wasting no time\r\nin wondering how it chanced to be covered with clay or hollowed to a\r\nshell, had taken it up, to depart with it as swiftly and directly as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nEven his tools still lay beside the hollow tree utilized for a smelter.\r\nThe one explanation that addressed itself to his mind as being\r\nplausible was that the visitors, knowing of the log and having planned\r\nto secure it, perhaps in merely passing by the island, had come ashore\r\nso soon as the first faint gray of dawn broke the shadows of the\r\njungle, when they had taken their prize and halted for nothing, not\r\neven a search for whatsoever tools they must have seen had been\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nOnce more his original theory of their superstitious fright of the\r\nisland's \"haunt\" seemed to Grenville to be confirmed.  He felt the\r\nnatives had sneaked ashore--not in fear of himself, since they could\r\nnot have foreknown his presence on the hill, but in possible fear of\r\nsome spirit of the place whose wailing filled them with dread.\r\n\r\nBarely less cautiously than heretofore, he followed the faintly\r\nimprinted trail of the boat's mysterious abductors, where it led across\r\nthe clearing.  He was certain now that a cleared path did exist where\r\nhe had partially explored the previous morning.  But branches and\r\nshrubbery had been freshly cut, as if to insure the silent passage of\r\nthe log.\r\n\r\nThe lane thus created through the thicket led directly down an easy\r\nslope to a broken bit of seawall at the bottom.  This, at high tide,\r\nwould be scarcely a foot above the water.  Here the log had undoubtedly\r\nbeen rested.  Both broken clay and a charcoal smudge recorded the\r\nunseen fact.\r\n\r\nThe entire inlet was no more than twenty feet across.  It was bounded\r\non either side by pitted walls that permitted no access to the jungle.\r\nThe last faint hope of again beholding his precious boat now vanished\r\nfrom Grenville's mind.  It had not been moored, nor probably even\r\ntowed, but doubtless loaded bodily on the visitor's deck, to be taken\r\nto parts unknown.\r\n\r\nBut, if this heavy fact sunk home in his breast, the man was somewhat\r\nrelieved, at least, concerning a probable native left behind.  He felt\r\npractically certain that none of the crew of the native craft had\r\nstepped beyond his clearing.  How much they might guess as to who had\r\nhollowed the heavy log was another matter altogether.  He knew that\r\ntheir tale would be widely told--and felt that developments would\r\nfollow.\r\n\r\nHe went to Elaine, to whom he owed a report.\r\n\r\n\"I think we're alone on the place,\" he said, and related all he had\r\ndiscovered.  \"We may as well re-light our fires,\" he added, in\r\nconclusion, \"and eat the best our sunny possessions afford.\"\r\n\r\nElaine could not so promptly recover from all she had undergone.  She\r\nstill sat staring at his face, a prey to confused emotions.\r\n\r\n\"Suppose they had really been friendly, after all--and we let them go\r\nand leave us here like that?\"\r\n\r\n\"In that event they may return, since the boat will excite a bit of\r\nwonder.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean they will know, of course, that someone must be here who made\r\nit?\"\r\n\r\n\"It certainly tells that story rather plainly.\"\r\n\r\nShe was thinking rapidly.\r\n\r\n\"Then--if they shouldn't happen to be friendly, they would know it all\r\njust the same--and may still come back to--look us up?\"\r\n\r\nGrenville nodded.\r\n\r\n\"I shall certainly go to work with that chance in view.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she agreed, \"we'll certainly do all we can.  But another boat\r\nwould take you weeks!  After all your patient, tedious work--to have it\r\nstolen like that!  Oh, I could cry, if I weren't so vexed and sorry!\"\r\n\r\nGrenville smiled despite his sense of loss.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps I can rig some sort of a catamaran,\" he answered.  \"But for\r\nday and night sailing, such as we would doubtless have before us, the\r\nbest of boats would be none too comfortable.\"\r\n\r\n\"And we don't know where to sail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--not precisely.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then--what is the first thing to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cook and devour a hearty dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"But after that--to-morrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God for peace--and prepare for war, meanwhile praying it may not\r\ncome.\"\r\n\r\nElaine was grave, but her voice was clear and steady.\r\n\r\n\"You think it will--that a fight will come? ... I'd much rather know\r\nthe worst.\"\r\n\r\n\"So would I!\" said Grenville, cheerfully.  \"We can't.  We can only get\r\nready to acquit ourselves like--well, like gentlemen, and keep out an\r\neye for a steamer....  Would you mind retreating to the cave I found,\r\nif dire necessity arose?\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll go wherever you tell me,\" she answered, with a smile that went to\r\nhis heart.  \"But of course I can't help wishing that a steamer would\r\nreally come.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nA FATEFUL EXPLOSION\r\n\r\nWith feverish energy Grenville was at work, attempting to achieve a\r\ndozen ends at once.\r\n\r\nNearly a week of high-pressure application appeared to have\r\naccomplished so little.  Yet a hundred pounds at least of his liveliest\r\npowder had been mixed and stored away, either loosely or packed in the\r\nbamboo bombs, of which he had a dozen; much extra bamboo had been cut\r\nand brought to the terrace; a new lot of jugs had been molded of clay\r\nand were finally being fired in his former smelter; baskets were made\r\nand ready for fruits, should retreat to the cave be rendered expedient,\r\nand his first small raft, or catamaran, for gaining the exit to the\r\ncavern, was all but ready to launch.\r\n\r\nHe had taken the bowsprit of the barque and three large stems from the\r\nbamboo growth as a basis for this craft.  The bamboo stems were firmly\r\nlashed together, to act as a mate for the bowsprit.  They were held\r\naway from the latter at a distance of about three feet by some of the\r\nfew unrotted bits of board he had torn from the old vessel's cabin,\r\nplus more bamboo, split and employed for his platform.\r\n\r\nTwo half-cylindrical sections of this useful plant he had lashed to\r\neight-foot poles of considerable stiffness to complete a pair of oars.\r\nHis rowlocks, saved from the smelting processes, he finally tested in\r\ntheir sockets, where a rigid bridge had been stoutly secured across his\r\nraftlike contrivance, and found them all he could desire.  The seat he\r\nhad planned to occupy in rowing he abandoned now as quite superfluous.\r\n\r\nHe felt he must lose no time in draining the cave, for possible use in\r\na siege.  There was no other task that had been altogether neglected.\r\nThe flagpole was once more standing on the terrace; abundant fuse was\r\nmade, dried, coiled, and safely stored from damp or accident, and a\r\nmold was hardening in the fire for running lead slugs that would make\r\nthe cannon effective.\r\n\r\nFor this latter need he meant to sacrifice his hammer.  It, with the\r\nlead he had saved before, would supply some six or seven pounds of this\r\nneedful ammunition.  Now, as he swiftly braided three slender creepers\r\nin a \"painter\" for his crudely fashioned catamaran, he glanced at the\r\ntide inquiringly, and likewise up at the sun.  There was over an hour\r\nin which to get to the cave, lodge a bomb in the ledge, and blow out\r\nthe dam that held back the water, but the tide was still running\r\nagainst him.\r\n\r\nWith ten feet only of his mooring-line completed, he abandoned the\r\nbraiding impatiently, secured one end to his raft at the estuary's\r\nentrance, and, wading in behind the clumsy structure, launched it with\r\none impetuous heave across the sandbar to the sea.  Boarding\r\nimmediately with his oars, he rowed it far enough only to prove he\r\ncould drive it against the tide, and then brought it back to the shore.\r\n\r\n\"One bomb and a torch,\" he meditated, aloud.  \"I can hang the bomb\r\nacross my shoulder to keep it out of the wet.\"\r\n\r\nThe catamaran having been made thoroughly secure, he hastened away to\r\nthe terrace.  He missed Elaine.  She was down at the \"smelter,\"\r\nattending the fire that was roasting the new clay vessels.\r\n\r\nWith a bomb and his lighted torch in hand--held well apart and not for\r\na moment handled carelessly--he hailed Elaine from the edge of the\r\nthicket by the wall.\r\n\r\n\"Just thought I'd drop around and drain out that water from the cave,\"\r\nhe announced.  \"Everything's ready--and I've nothing else to do.  When\r\nyou hear the salute, you'll know it's a commonplace affair.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh!\" said Elaine, who had her doubts concerning his various\r\nexplosions.  \"I'll watch to see you from the cliff.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--er--I wouldn't stand just at the edge, you know--not till you\r\nknow it's all over.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're not going to blow down the hill?\"\r\n\r\n\"Hope not, I've taken a baby bomb, but I didn't wish to let it off till\r\nI'd told you what to expect.  I'd keep away, in case of flying pieces.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" said Elaine.  \"But I'll go up now, and perhaps you can call\r\nto let me know how well you have succeeded.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll send you a wireless.\"\r\n\r\nGrenville hastened to his raft.  \"Please God she may never have to hear\r\nme fire another!\" he thought, as he went, reflecting on things that\r\nmight happen.  He could not have known that only a mild beginning had\r\nbeen made on their programme as scheduled by the Fates.\r\n\r\nHe was soon rowing eagerly and vigorously against the current of the\r\ntide, which would run with lessening velocity for perhaps another hour.\r\nWhen he came to the cave, he promptly discovered why the injunction to\r\nenter its mouth at high water only had been made a point in the mystic\r\ndirections found with the map in the tube.\r\n\r\nThe ledge whereon he had landed before was deeply undercut.  During a\r\ntide no more than two or three feet lower than this that would serve\r\nhim to-day, the place could scarcely be approached, and could never be\r\nentered at all.  The swirl, which was rarely ever absent from the\r\nplace, increased in violence steadily with the lowering levels of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIt was not without some chance of catastrophe that he presently landed\r\non the shelf.  He lost little time in securing his painter to the\r\nrocks, the line so adjusted he could readily slip it from the crevice\r\nshould a hasty retreat seem wise.\r\n\r\nThe task of blasting out the ledge was not a simple matter.  To lodge\r\nthe bomb where its energy would be directed almost wholly against the\r\ndam, or rock, and yet protect it from the trickling stream that could\r\nreadily render it useless, involved an extra toil of piling rocks, on\r\nwhich he had not reckoned.\r\n\r\nFortunately, much of the thickest wall was opposed to the pot-hole in\r\nthe dam, while one or two extra-heavy fragments from the cliff were so\r\nlightly poised he could drop them in the breach.  Despite these natural\r\nadvantages, however, he labored hotly for fully half an hour before he\r\ncould even lay his fuse.\r\n\r\nMeantime, his torch was blazing smokily, against his final need of\r\nigniting the match and later exploring for results.  At length he\r\nlooped the fuse along a ragged line of broken honeycomb, where pits had\r\nbeen eaten in the tufa, and trailed it well down to the brink of the\r\nledge, with its end propped high between two bowlders.\r\n\r\nWith one last look at all his careful arrangements, he slipped off his\r\nraft-line, caught up his torch, and was stepping down to board his\r\nfloat when a sharp piece of rock broke away beneath his foot and\r\ndropped him forward on his hand.\r\n\r\nThe torch was flung against the fuse, where it lay along the slope.  He\r\nheard it hiss, where the powder had caught, and aware that, by three or\r\nfour feet, it was shorter now than he had ever intended to light it, he\r\nlurched full-length upon his raft and fumbled to clutch up the oars.\r\n\r\nBut the swirl was on, and the catamaran seemed possessed to bump\r\nagainst the ledge.\r\n\r\nIn a final desperate outburst of strength, he sent the thing shooting\r\noutward.  Its bow would have turned in the whirlpool then, but he drove\r\nit clear of the point.\r\n\r\nLike a madman he pulled at the clumsy oars, to reach the protection\r\nwhere the wall all but folded the basin from the sea.\r\n\r\nHis raft was around it--half of the raft--and another good foot would\r\nhave covered himself, when the blast abruptly boomed.\r\n\r\nEven out of the tail of his eye he saw the dull-red flare behind a blot\r\nthat represented ragged rock in motion.\r\n\r\nA fragment no larger than a man's two fists came as straight as a\r\ncannon projectile and struck the pitted wall beside his head.\r\n\r\nHe had ducked instinctively forward, which doubtless saved his life.\r\nBut dozens of smaller and barely less violent fragments were broken\r\naway from the edge of the wall by the piece with the meteoric speed.\r\nOne of these struck him above the ear--and down he went, face forward,\r\non the platform, to hang with arms and shoulders loosely supported on\r\nthe bridge that was used for the sockets of his rowlocks.\r\n\r\nA rain of loose pieces hissed about in the sea.  The cave belched smoke\r\nlike a suddenly active volcano.  The tide took the raft, with its\r\nmotionless burden, and floated it back whence the man had come, but not\r\nso close in the shore.\r\n\r\nThen up on the cliff, when the shock and hail had subsided from all the\r\nair about her, Elaine came inquiringly over to the brink, to receive\r\nsome word that all was well.\r\n\r\nThe smoke still rose from down below and obscured the face of the\r\nwaters.  There was nothing Elaine could discover.  She waited a time\r\nthat seemed very long, in her usual determination not to seem unduly\r\nalarmed or importunate concerning Sidney's safety.\r\n\r\nBut at last she called his name.\r\n\r\nThere was no response.  Her uneasiness increased.  She called again,\r\nand moved along the brink, staring eagerly down at the sea.\r\n\r\nThen at last a sound like a stifled moan escaped her whitened lips.\r\nShe had seen that prostrate, helpless figure drifting down by the shore\r\non his raft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nWHAT THE BLAST DISCOVERED\r\n\r\nGrenville revived, with his characteristic pertinacity.  An impulse to\r\nsave himself was still alive in his brain.  Actuated by its survival,\r\nhe struggled galvanically to rise.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, please!\" said a voice, that sounded remarkably familiar.  \"Please\r\ntry to keep quiet for a little!\"\r\n\r\nYet he had to sit up, with one hand to support him, if nothing more.\r\n\r\nHe was still on the raft, and there was Elaine, on her knees, pulling\r\nhard at his oars to drive the float ashore.  She was dripping wet from\r\nhead to foot.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Grenville regarded her blankly, while the situation\r\ncleared in his brain.\r\n\r\n\"What ho, skipper!\" he said, a bit faintly.  \"You didn't swim out to\r\nthis contraption?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are bleeding,\" she answered, tugging no less stoutly at the oars.\r\n\"I thought you might be dead.  The tide was floating you away--and I\r\ndon't see why----  Won't you please sit still and behave?\"\r\n\r\nGrenville had felt of his head, then arisen to take the sweeps from her\r\nhands, though the catamaran was about to ground on the beach.\r\n\r\n\"You did swim!\" he said.  \"I should have warned you of the sh----  I'm\r\nan idiot!--trying to blow my head off!\"  He knelt on the edge of the\r\nplatform and began to bathe his scalp.\r\n\r\n\"I hate that cave!\" Elaine declared, with emphasis.  \"And I hate those\r\nawful bombs!  I sha'n't have any clothing left, if you go on killing\r\nyourself like this every day!\"  She was tearing another bandage from\r\nher petticoat and felt obliged to scold.\r\n\r\nGrenville was not at all certain it would not be decidedly pleasant to\r\nbe wounded constantly.  It was perilously joyous to be scolded and\r\nbandaged by Elaine.  He certainly submitted most meekly as she now tied\r\nup his head.  He was not deeply cut, and felt considerably aggrieved\r\nthat the blow had rendered him unconscious.\r\n\r\n\"You'll find the skull isn't dented,\" he observed, \"unless it's from\r\nthe inside out.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's a great big swelling,\" said Elaine.  \"And suppose you had been\r\nkilled?\"\r\n\r\nGrenville made no immediate reply.  He was gazing abstractedly out\r\nacross the water.  His inner vision conjured up the picture of a brave,\r\nunselfish little comrade, swimming fearlessly out to board a raft\r\nwhereon a helpless figure was lying--a pale-faced girl who would\r\ndoubtless have had no hesitation had she known of all the sharks in the\r\nworld.  He could see her scramble on the float to ease him where he\r\nlay.  And then her hot tussle with the clumsy oars, as she knelt on the\r\nwave-slopped platform, to urge it and him to the shore!\r\n\r\n\"I'm a thoughtless brute,\" he told her, finally.  \"But I felt the work\r\nwas important.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is important!  I'm sure of that,\" she answered, at once all\r\ncontrition.  \"But perhaps next time--you might take me along----  If\r\nanything should kill us both--why, that would be simple and easy.\"\r\n\r\nHe understood her thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\"Quite an idea,\" he answered, briefly.  \"I was sure you understood the\r\nsituation----  To-morrow I'll go and see what the blast accomplished.\r\nI shall have no more explosions, however--so I may not need a chaperon.\"\r\n\r\nShe was slightly hurt.  His offhand speeches were not always absolutely\r\nwelcome, despite her former attitude and declarations.  After all, it\r\nwas God, she told herself, who had brought this partnership into being.\r\nIt was He who had cast her into exile with the bravest man she had ever\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\"You mean,\" she said, \"you do not want me along.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the tide that's ungallant,\" he said.  \"It objects to anyone's\r\nlanding on the ledge.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you said I might be obliged to hide there later.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did, and till then--let's enjoy the sunshine--while it lasts.\"\r\n\r\nElaine said no more.  The hint of inimical things to come sufficed once\r\nmore to carry her thoughts away from all personal emotions.\r\n\r\nThey returned in silence to the terrace, Grenville first having urged\r\nhis catamaran within the estuary, to secure it with the line.  The\r\ncommonplace duties of their daily existence were promptly resumed, and\r\nthe cave as a topic was forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe following day, while he waited for the tide to rise to its highest\r\nlevel, Grenville completed the labor at the furnace, where additional\r\nvessels for water were being permitted to cool.  The importance of\r\nbeing enabled to store an unusual quantity of water, should the need\r\narise for such a storage, had early been presented to his mind.  He was\r\ntherefore particularly gratified to find this present firing of jugs\r\nconsiderably more successful than the first.\r\n\r\nElaine was engaged in weaving two nets, in which these clay vessels\r\ncould be carried.  With a yoke for Grenville's shoulders, or even for\r\nher own, a pair of the jugs could thus be fetched at once and the labor\r\nthereby materially hastened, should a moment arrive in which such haste\r\nwould be wise.\r\n\r\nIt was ever disturbing to her mind to reflect on this possible need.\r\nThe thought was never wholly absent from her as she watched the\r\nhorizon, far and near, for the steamer that did not come.  Not even in\r\nher happiest moments--and many were happy, she confessed, despite all\r\nthe hardships of their daily life, as they two toiled together, an\r\nexiled pair alone in this tropical garden--not even in these was that\r\nsinister, underlying _motif_ too indistinct to be acknowledged.  It\r\nhung like a thing in vague suspense above their every occupation,\r\nthroughout the day and night.\r\n\r\nA tremor more tangible played through her breast as Elaine watched\r\nGrenville take a torch as before and depart for the third of his visits\r\nto the cave.\r\n\r\nWithout consulting the lord and master of the island, she moved her\r\nwork from the shelter of her \"house\" to the cliff-edge, from which she\r\ncould watch him a time before he should come to the cavern itself and\r\nso be lost to sight.\r\n\r\nShe was thus enabled, unobserved, to inspect him, to her heart's\r\ncontent, as Grenville came rowing his raft along the tide, far down\r\nbelow her rocky aerie.\r\n\r\nThe man was absorbed in the task thus set to be accomplished.  He did\r\nnot look up, as Elaine thought he might, as he skimmed along under the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the cave he was somewhat surprised at the wreckage his\r\nblast had accomplished.  Not only was the former ledge completely\r\nshattered, but much had fallen below in the sea, while the wall to the\r\nright, where the bomb had expended its energy, was agape with\r\nnew-formed fissures.\r\n\r\nChiefly concerned with the dam of rock, Grenville secured his raft with\r\nboyish impatience and carried his torch ashore.  A moment afterwards he\r\nwalked through the breach in the erstwhile solid ledge, and could\r\nreadily imagine the roar with which the water, formerly behind the\r\nbarrier, had tumbled torrentially into the swirling tide.\r\n\r\nThere was still a tiny trickle flowing down the channel made by the\r\nbomb.  The basin formed by the bottom of the cavern was still\r\nexceedingly damp, and here and there it retained a shallow pool of\r\nwater too low for the gateway to drain.  He walked about freely,\r\npausing here and there to hold his torch aloft and measure the cave's\r\ndimensions by means of the light from both the open entrance and his\r\nblazing, yellow flame.\r\n\r\nHe was struck, in gazing at the wall he had broken near the cavern's\r\nmouth, with the size of one of the fissures there, where the blast had\r\nwrought its havoc.  So black and significant appeared this new-formed\r\naperture that, although a certain eagerness to proceed forthwith to the\r\ntreasure niche was upon him, he returned at once to investigate the\r\nhole.\r\n\r\nWhat he found upon his first superficial examination was merely a\r\ncrevice, half as wide as his body, where a plinth of rock had been\r\nsplit from the mass and dropped towards the breach in the dam.  Into\r\nthis crevice he thrust his torch, and was instantly interested to note\r\nthat its flame blew decidedly from him, in a draught of air that was\r\nflowing unmistakably upward.  Moreover, on lifting himself sufficiently\r\nhigh to look about in the dimly lighted space, he became convinced that\r\neither a second chamber or a passage like a hall existed just back of\r\nthe principal cavern, from which it was partitioned by the wall.\r\n\r\nHe planted his torch between some loosened fragments and shook at the\r\npiece that blocked this auxiliary cave.  He thought he could topple the\r\nslab out forwards on the ledge.  But, when he rocked it with his\r\ncustomary vigor, it fell abruptly backwards and disappeared in the\r\ngloom.\r\n\r\nThe hole he had thus created was quite large enough to admit him,\r\nsqueezing in sideways.  He promptly entered with his torch, finding the\r\nfoothold rough and insecure.  The chamber itself was small and low.  He\r\ncould readily touch the ceiling.\r\n\r\nAhead it apparently ended in a wall, with a gaping crack.  On moving\r\nthere, however, he found, to his surprise, an angular turn, still wide\r\nenough to admit of easy passage.  The way under foot was slightly\r\nupward.  It was pitted rock, but surprisingly free from broken\r\nfragments.\r\n\r\nPersuaded at once that no other man had ever discovered this\r\nchannel-like chamber in the tufa, and that therefore no treasure would\r\nbe found concealed in its depths, Grenville continued onward with\r\nunabated interest, curious to see how far the passage might extend.\r\n\r\nIt narrowed again, and pierced decidedly upward through the bulk of the\r\nhuge rock mass.  Obliged at last to stoop too low for comfort,\r\nGrenville began to wonder if the thing would never end.  It appeared to\r\nbe exceptionally straight for a natural tunnel in volcanic rock, but\r\nSidney began to realize its upward incline had rapidly increased.\r\n\r\nWhen he presently found himself enabled to stand once more erect, he\r\npaused to cast a light on the walls to confirm a new thought in his\r\nmind.  He had finally remembered a feature long before noted on top of\r\nthe terrace itself--the long straight crack through the massive tower\r\nof tufa and the \"slip\" that had once formed a shelf.\r\n\r\nNot without a certain sort of excited hope did he now discover\r\nunmistakable signs that some convulsion of the island had at one time\r\nactually parted the right-hand mass of rock from the larger portion on\r\nthe left and permitted the former to drop.  If this channel could only\r\ncontinue----\r\n\r\nHe went upward again, more swiftly, wondering thus belatedly how far he\r\nmight have come and regretting he had not thought to pace the distance.\r\nThrough a place ahead he was barely able to force his supple body.\r\nThen came another passageway that was not only narrow but low.\r\nFragments of stone were likewise under foot, and the passage formed\r\nanother angle.\r\n\r\nBeyond this turn he found himself confronted by more broken stone and a\r\ndifficult ascent.  But, toiling up there eagerly, he presently raised\r\nhis eyes and beheld a bright white line, as narrow as a streak of\r\nlightning.\r\n\r\nIt was simply a crack through a shattered bit of wall that closed up\r\nthe end of the passage.  It was daylight--sky--that he saw thus\r\nslenderly defined, and the man could have shouted in joy!\r\n\r\nHe could not, however, escape to the outside world when he presently\r\ncame to the wall.  For all the fragments he loosened and threw back\r\nbehind him, he could not open the exit, or even determine where it was.\r\nOnly work outside could accomplish this end, and this he was wild to\r\nbegin.\r\n\r\nAbout to turn back and hasten to the terrace, he realized instantly how\r\nutterly impossible might be the task of finding the place from without.\r\nBut Elaine was doubtless on the terrace.  If only his voice could be\r\ncarried to her ears, she could mark the spot at once.\r\n\r\nBut, although he called with all his lusty might, there was no response\r\nfrom the camp where Elaine was doubtless working.  His torch was\r\nburning low, with the draught fanning constantly past him through the\r\nchannel.  It occurred to his mind to go back to Elaine and instruct her\r\nhow she could assist him.  He also thought to place his torch against\r\nthe crack and permit its smoke to filter through and perhaps thereby\r\nblacken the fissure.\r\n\r\nUntil he felt he must save what remained, to illumine his way downward,\r\nhe burned the torch close to the rocks.  And thus, when he came to the\r\nlarger cave again, he was once more obliged to depart with not even a\r\nsight of the treasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nAN INTERRUPTED DIVERSION\r\n\r\nNot only had Grenville to a small extent succeeded in smudging the\r\noutside terminal of the passage discovered through the rock, but also\r\nElaine had discovered the smoke so strangely ascending in the air.\r\n\r\nShe had been thoroughly mystified by the singular sight, but had crept\r\nabout the place inquiringly, expecting perhaps a volcano to begin some\r\ndestructive demonstration.  She had likewise fancied that rumbling\r\nsounds proceeded from somewhere in the \"mountain.\"  The entire\r\nphenomenon had finally ceased, however, greatly to her relief.\r\n\r\nOn a narrow ledge, some four feet down from the terrace-level, and\r\ndirectly beneath the extensive crack that had once been formed in the\r\nmassive upheaval of tufa, the broken fragments that blocked the\r\nsubterranean hallway were wedged to their places in the wall.  The\r\nplace was sunk in a shallow niche that was screened by the trees of the\r\njungle.\r\n\r\nThis ledge Grenville not only promptly rendered accessible, but, after\r\nthe opening had once been cleared, he fashioned a door of the lightest\r\nconstruction, that still resembled solid rock, with which to conceal it\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nHis door was of wattle, plastered with clay, which he then thrust full\r\nof tufa fragments.  These, when the substance presently hardened, were\r\nfound to be substantially cemented to the framework.  The clay itself\r\ndried yellowish gray and could hardly be distinguished from the rock.\r\nHe was thus enabled to plaster over all the chinks and other ragged\r\nopenings which the door could not completely cover.  When the job was\r\ndone, not the faintest suspicion of anything unusual about the niche\r\ncould the keenest eye have discovered.  Grenville was none the less\r\nglad, however, that the tallest foliage of the near-by growth still\r\nfurther concealed the spot.\r\n\r\nHe was toiling no less feverishly than before, thankful each day that\r\nthe tidal wailing still continued and anxiously watching the round of\r\nthe purple horizon for the cut of a rakish sail.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that several days had passed since the passage was\r\ndiscovered, he had made no effort to return to the treasure crypt\r\nbelow.  The communicating gallery was too important to be neglected.\r\nHe had spent long hours in its upper reaches, clearing the rock from\r\nunderfoot, to make its use entirely practical for Elaine and himself in\r\nall conditions, either with or without some needed burden.\r\n\r\nHe had managed to widen the narrowest squeeze by chipping the rock with\r\nhis chisel.  He had carefully rearranged the broken fragments down\r\nwhere the corridor entered, or branched from, the cavern, and there\r\nprovided a second of his wattle doors, considerably heavier than the\r\nfirst and more artfully studded with stone.  This he had made to be\r\nadjusted from without or within the passage it concealed.  From within\r\nit could also be barred in place with a heavy billet of the toughest\r\nwood his brazen tools would shape.\r\n\r\nThis late afternoon, when the last of his jugs had been taken down and\r\nconcealed by the spring, all ready for filling and carrying back the\r\nmoment occasion should arise, Grenville felt that, save for a meat\r\nsupply, he had made nearly every possible provision against attack and\r\nsiege.\r\n\r\nThe day was practically spent.  He glanced at the sun.  Undecided\r\nbetween an hour of hunting with his bow and a quick excursion down to\r\nthe crypt of treasure, he remembered certain ornaments Elaine might\r\nwear and decided to go for the gold and gleaming jewels.  They had meat\r\nfor dinner, already being roasted in a sandpit with several newly\r\ngathered yams.\r\n\r\nElaine, with a basket of tempting fruits, returned to the terrace from\r\nthe thicket before he was ready for his trip.  The fact that he bore a\r\ntorch and basket aroused no query in her mind, so frequently had he\r\nmade his underground excursions.\r\n\r\nHe left the door at the gallery entrance open and made an easy descent.\r\nGlad to be independent of both the tide and his raft, he paused when he\r\ncame to the main cave's ragged opening, for a moment thoroughly\r\nstartled.\r\n\r\nThe weird tidal wail had just commenced, so close at hand it echoed all\r\nthrough the place.  It had never before occurred while he was actually\r\nin the cavern.  Immediately rendered curious to see whence and how it\r\nwas produced, he hastened down the outside ledge, completely baffled by\r\nthe intermingled reverberations.\r\n\r\nHe had barely concentrated his attention on a certain hole in the rock,\r\nbelow the tidal level, when the last uncanny moan seemed choked to a\r\nhorrible gurgle which could not be renewed.\r\n\r\nThe thing had never before been so brief or so abruptly ended.  Its\r\nbrevity jarred upon him no less unpleasantly than its prolongation had\r\ndone when he and Elaine first arrived upon the island.  As if the\r\noccurrence sounded a warning not to be mistaken, he proceeded at once\r\nwithin the cave.\r\n\r\nHis mind was filled with thoughts of native visitors, who might only be\r\nwaiting for this natural phenomenon to cease before they came swarming\r\nacross the sea, perhaps to search and loot this very cavern.  He\r\nreflected they might have searched it before, and had either been\r\nbaffled by the water it formerly contained or had missed the niche his\r\naccidental interest had discovered.\r\n\r\nThough he thought that less than half the wall he had previously\r\nassaulted could now remain in the arch of the treasure cavern, yet\r\nfully a half-hour's labor was essential before he could worm his way\r\ninside where the gold and the stones dully glittered.  He cleared out a\r\nfew more stones to admit his carrying basket.\r\n\r\nA thrill went through him as he laid his hands upon the priceless\r\ntreasures disposed in the tomblike place.  Notwithstanding the fact the\r\ncave had been scaled, almost hermetically, a coating of thin,\r\nimpalpable dust veiled everything he touched.  The things had\r\nundoubtedly been here years on years, till perhaps tradition only still\r\naffirmed their existence, while old fanatics might, for generations,\r\nhave persisted in tattooing that \"map\" on some victim's breast for the\r\ncavern's living concealment and the faithful preservation of its\r\ncontents.\r\n\r\nThe gold was all wrought in ornaments--like anklets, bracelets,\r\namulets, and girdles.  It had all been crudely pounded into shape from\r\nvirgin metal.  There were pieces of odd, unfamiliar shape, the uses for\r\nwhich could hardly be conjectured.  It was all of it heavy and massive,\r\nmany pieces crudely resembling cumbrous seals with mystic devices\r\nstamped on either side.\r\n\r\nOf the stones--comprising principally diamonds, rubies, and\r\nsapphires--many were still uncut, while others, by the handful, were\r\ncrudely mounted in hammered gold to form girdle after girdle.  A crown,\r\nexhibiting nothing of the jeweler's modern or even ancient craft, was\r\nnone the less of extraordinary intrinsic value for the heft of gold\r\nthat formed its band and the huge stones thrust rudely through its\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\nDespite his impatience to collect the lot in his basket and depart the\r\nplace, Grenville remained there inactively, absorbed in a study of this\r\npiece or that, to identify, if possible, the curious workmanship.  That\r\nmuch, if not all, the gold work argued craftsmen of the African wilds\r\nhe felt convinced.  But the stones could have come from India only, he\r\nwas sure, either through tribute or plundering, and the latter was by\r\nfar the more likely method.\r\n\r\nHe had heard from one of his oldest friends, who was likewise the best\r\ninformed of all his military acquaintances, that the West Coast\r\nAfricans still conceal vast treasures of kings or chiefs deceased, such\r\nburied wealth to be utilized by former possessors in some life beyond\r\nthe grave.  That this hoard, by some strange and unusual chance, had\r\nresulted from that barbaric practice he felt there could be no doubt.\r\nThe fact it was hundreds of miles from Africa argued nothing against\r\nthe theory, since either by imitation or as a result of far excursions\r\nover sea the present collection could have landed here in this\r\nremarkably hidden and \"spirit\"-guarded cave, where even the hardiest,\r\ncleverest seeker of fortune would never be likely to search.\r\n\r\nHe was still engaged, like some merely scientific archeologist, in\r\nexamining piece after piece of the metal, or one after another of the\r\nstones, which were cut as never he had seen them before, when he\r\nfancied some weird, faint echo called his name.\r\n\r\nWith pounds of the trinkets in his hands, he returned to the broken\r\nheap of stones he had lately overthrown.  Out of the ringing silence of\r\nthe larger cave came a distant wisp of sound----\r\n\r\nHe knew that Elaine was calling from somewhere in the passage.\r\n\r\nIt was only the work of a moment to catch up his basket and place in\r\nits hold the small stone sarcophagi of jewels.  Carelessly then, on top\r\nof these, he swept in the ornaments of gold.  They fell, dully ringing,\r\nfrom the shelves, where perhaps they had lain for above a century--a\r\nheterogeneous collection which he was sorry to disturb till the various\r\npositions in which they had been disposed could be noted and remembered.\r\n\r\nHe was certain no less than a hundredweight of the treasure taxed his\r\nstrength when he presently lifted his burden from the place and bore it\r\nacross the larger chamber.\r\n\r\nElaine was calling again.  Her voice was clearer in the passage.\r\nGrenville came there, panting from his effort, with his dusty and\r\nuseless riches.  He answered at once on entering the gallery, where he\r\npaused to close and secure his concealing door.\r\n\r\n\"Please come!\" was the cry, in response to his shout, like an unreal\r\nvoice from the blackness of a tomb.  \"They're here!  They're close to\r\nthe island!\"\r\n\r\nWith a short but inarticulate ejaculation, Grenville once more took up\r\nhis basket, blundered forward with it a few feet only, and set it down\r\nagainst the wall.  Why he had paused to bother with it, for a moment he\r\ndid not understand.  With his torch flaring back, in his greater speed,\r\nhe plunged along and up the passage.\r\n\r\nAround the first of the sharper angles he came upon Elaine.  She had\r\nbrought no torch, in her hurry to sound the alarm, but had groped her\r\nway downward through the Stygian blackness of the gallery, calling time\r\nafter time as the gloom rendered up no reply.\r\n\r\nHer eyes were dilated wildly, from her efforts to see in the dark.  Her\r\nface seemed intensely white against the impenetrable ebon.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I thought you'd never come!\" she said, as Sidney approached with\r\nhis light.  \"They were almost up to the island before I dreamed such a\r\nthing could be!  The tree must have hidden the sail!\"\r\n\r\nGrenville placed the torch in her hand and urged her upward before him.\r\nThey presently emerged on the ledge.\r\n\r\nHe had no more than crept to the terrace-edge and studied the craft\r\nbelow on the sea than he came once more to Elaine.\r\n\r\n\"No use in striking our flag,\" he said.  \"They've seen it.  We'll fly\r\nit till the end.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nREVEALING AN INTENT\r\n\r\nThe native ship, that had sailed unobserved within almost hailing\r\ndistance of the headland, was not the one that had come to the island\r\nbefore.  It was larger.  Six men at least comprised its crew, a\r\nvillainous-looking collection.\r\n\r\nGrenville had seen them close at hand, as they passed by the entrance\r\nto the cave.  That they contemplated an immediate landing seemed\r\nprobable, making as they were towards the crescent indentation along by\r\nthe estuary's mouth.\r\n\r\nSidney had lost little time in vain regrets for the hour spent\r\nuselessly below.  He had gone at once to the gallery and hidden its\r\nentrance with the door.  He had caught up Elaine's well-finished nets\r\nand the pole for a yoke she had been working to complete when the\r\nvisitors' sail was discovered and, only pausing to make certain he\r\ncould not be seen, went at once to the spring for extra jugs of water.\r\n\r\nThe sun was already dipping redly in its bath when he brought his first\r\nburden to the terrace.  He paused to observe the maneuvers of the ship,\r\nnow coming about in the sunset breeze, just off the tiny inlet where\r\nhis catamaran was moored.\r\n\r\nThe queer sharp sail was reefed while he was watching.  He saw three\r\nmen heave overboard an anchor, which promptly sounded the shallow\r\ndepths where the strange craft presently swung.\r\n\r\nConsiderably to Elaine's discomfort of mind, he hastened once more down\r\nthe trail.  She was certain the Dyaks would go to the spring before\r\nSidney could got away.  However, he brought another pair of jugs, an\r\narmful of fuel, and a basket of fruit with the greatest possible\r\nexpedition.\r\n\r\nThe boatmen made no movement to come ashore as long as the twilight\r\nrevealed them.  The highest notes of their voices floated indistinctly\r\nto the terrace, towards which the men were frequently seen to gesture,\r\nbut even these sounds were finally lost as darkness enwrapped the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nDespite the fact that four of his water-jugs still remained in the\r\nthicket near the spring, Grenville made no more trips for water that\r\nevening, since Elaine was obviously distressed by the thought of the\r\nrisk he might incur.\r\n\r\nHe was awake all night, maintaining the life of their smoldering fire,\r\nand alert for any signs or sounds of movement in the clearing by the\r\ntrail.  In one of the darkest hours before the dawn he heard the\r\nfamiliar wails and moans of the headland cave rise briefly on the wind.\r\n\r\nFrom the anchored ship the cry was returned, as on the former occasion.\r\nAfter that a droning chant came fitfully up from the darkness of the\r\nwaters, to die at last in the silence.  Later he heard a shout, and\r\nthen vague accents of speech.  But, when daylight arrived, the craft\r\nhad disappeared.\r\n\r\nElaine had not yet risen.  Grenville quietly moved from one extremity\r\nof the headland to the other, searching the sea in all directions.  He\r\nwas soon convinced the visitor had not decamped, but had moved the\r\nvessel to one or another of the island's hidden inlets, that its\r\nmovements, as well as those of its crew, should be no longer observed.\r\n\r\nOne lingering hope, which he had fostered in his breast, that the\r\nnatives might not prove a bloodthirsty lot of head-hunters after all,\r\nhe felt he must definitely abandon.  This furtive move under cover of\r\nthe dark was not the sort of maneuver to excite one's trust or\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nElaine was standing in her shelter door when at length he came once\r\nmore to his place by the top of the trail.  She, too, had discovered\r\nthe absence of the native vessel.\r\n\r\n\"I think another one came in the night,\" she said, when Sidney\r\nexplained his belief that the boat was in hiding behind the farther\r\nwalls.  \"I am sure I heard another voice.\"\r\n\r\nGrenville recalled the shout that had followed the chanting and felt\r\nthat this accounted for Elaine's conviction that more of the Dyaks had\r\narrived.\r\n\r\n\"We have not been actually seen as yet,\" he assured her.  \"Our flag of\r\ndistress is not a positive sign of anyone's presence on the island.  We\r\nshall soon determine by their movements whether these chaps intend to\r\nbe friendly or not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Would they hide if they meant to be friendly?\"\r\n\r\n\"It isn't a friendly sign----  You see, I'm still of opinion the\r\nisland's wail is a sound they rather dread.  Have you noticed it's\r\nrapidly failing?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've been ever so glad it seems so short and growing fainter.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he drawled.  \"I'm afraid it will soon cease altogether, when our\r\nfriends may buck up their courage and--show us their state of mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"What can we do in the meantime?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sit tight and watch for developments.\"\r\n\r\nBut all that day there was never so much as a sound or a sign of the\r\ncrew they had seen arrive.  At one time, just before noon, Grenville\r\nfancied some movement occurred in the rocks that crowned the second\r\nhill.  But he detected no further indication that someone might have\r\nscaled the cliff to spy on himself and Elaine.\r\n\r\nHe had never in his island rambles discovered a place by which that\r\nhill could be surmounted.  That easy access might be obtained on the\r\nseaward side he readily understood.  He fretted under the long\r\nsuspense--the uncertainty brooding over the island.  He much preferred\r\nthat the visitors exhibit a downright hostile intent than to feel that\r\nbeneath the sinister calm of thicket and jungle might lurk insidious\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nHe felt that Elaine and himself would lack for nothing, except fresh\r\nmeat, for at least a couple of days, yet he knew that even their fruit\r\nsupply was wholly inadequate for a siege, should the new arrivals make\r\nup their minds to starve them on the terrace.  Rather than weakly\r\nsubmit to any such abominable tactics, he was fully determined to bring\r\nabout an attack.  But how was an open question.\r\n\r\nWhen once again the night drew on the man was impatient and weary.  He\r\nhad taken no rest after all his long previous day of toil, yet to sleep\r\nand invite disaster up the trail was quite impossible.\r\n\r\n\"We shall have to divide the night,\" said Elaine, with her customary\r\npractical courage.  \"We have simply got to be sensible to preserve our\r\nstrength in case we have to fight.\"\r\n\r\nGrenville consented to give her the watch till midnight.  The island's\r\nwail in the late afternoon had seemed no fainter than that of the\r\nprevious day.  He was quite convinced there would be no night attack.\r\nYet he stretched a cord across the trail that must pull at his arm and\r\nso give an alarm should anyone enter at his gate.\r\n\r\nDoubtless in this confidence he fell asleep with more than usual\r\npromptness.  He was far more weary than he knew, and Nature demanded\r\nher dues.\r\n\r\nElaine was glad he could slumber so profoundly.  The night was barely\r\ncool; she was not in the least uncomfortable as she sat at Grenville's\r\nside.  She knew he would waken at the slightest tug on the cord so\r\nquickly contrived to warn of an enemy's approach, and therefore felt a\r\ndecided sense of security, despite the living silence of the night.\r\n\r\nLong before midnight she was tense with nervous apprehension.  Sounds\r\nfrom the jungle arose from time to time where some animal prowled for\r\nits prey.  A whisper came up from the waves that lapped the cliff, and\r\nhaunted the air as if with spirits.  She had steeled her heart,\r\nhowever, and would not weaken by a jot.  The hours would wear away\r\nsomehow, and meantime--Sidney was resting.\r\n\r\nShe did not arise to walk about as Grenville would have done.  Instead\r\nshe sat there, stiffly alert, turning her head from side to side, as\r\nthe minutes dragged heavily by, listening, staring through the\r\ndarkness, fancying shapes had begun to move in the shadows of the rocks.\r\n\r\nIt was finally late in the dead of night when a sound of unusual\r\nheaviness arose from the brink of the cliff.  Had someone dropped a\r\nrock in the sea, the disturbance could scarcely have been clearer.\r\n\r\nIt had come, she thought, from over beyond the great black tree that\r\nloomed against the sky.  She wondered if perhaps she ought to speak to\r\nSidney.  She put out her hand to touch him lightly on the shoulder, but\r\nwithdrew it again with a smile.  He was sleeping so like a tired boy!\r\n\r\nThe sound had doubtless been nothing to rouse the slightest alarm.  If\r\nit came again----\r\n\r\nIt did come again, less loud and distinct, but none the less\r\nunmistakable.  Her heart responded immediately with a quicker, heavier\r\nbeat.  Perhaps she should try to ascertain the source or the cause of\r\nthe noise.  She should feel so ashamed, so weak and burdensome, to\r\nGrenville if she woke him for nothing at all.  To look about was\r\nassuredly part of her duty while on guard.  It was only a step to the\r\nedge of the terrace, across familiar ground.\r\n\r\nChiding herself for unwarranted timidity and lack of courage, she\r\nsilently left her seat at last and stepped from Grenville's side.  One\r\nof his sticks was lying near.  She took it in her hand.  Then over\r\nthrough the shadows she glided as noiselessly as a spirit, goading\r\nherself to the ordeal with thoughts of the bold and fearless manner the\r\nman would show were he in her place on this safe and childish excursion.\r\n\r\nShe had heard nothing more, though she frequently paused to hold her\r\nbreath and await a further sound.  It was wholly absurd, she told\r\nherself, for her heart to pound so madly.  Just there to the brink,\r\npast those few large stones and shadows, and she would probably hear\r\nsome slopping of the waves that would quiet her liveliest suspicion.\r\n\r\nDespite her utmost efforts, however, she could not stand upright as she\r\nwent, and she could not continue quite to the edge without one or two\r\nmore pauses to catch her breath that would not come calmly to her lips.\r\nBut she forced herself all the way--save just the final cautious edging\r\nto the scarp, where she suddenly knelt and leaned a little forward.\r\n\r\nShe was still a bit short of the brink, but remained where she was to\r\ncalm her heart and listen.  She could hear the water plainly.  She felt\r\nentitled to arise and hasten back to Sidney--since of course there was\r\nnothing further to be heard.\r\n\r\nBut, before she could gather the strength to rise, a series of short,\r\npercussive sounds all but froze the core of her heart--so much did it\r\nseem like someone heavily panting.\r\n\r\nThen, as she sat there staring helplessly at the jagged edge, four dark\r\nthings--four fingers--crept actively over the lip of the wall--and a\r\nface abruptly followed, with a knife between its teeth!\r\n\r\n\"Sidney!\" she cried, and, madly thrusting the stick she had brought\r\nagainst the dark and hideous countenance, she arose and fled wildly\r\nfrom the place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTHE SILENT VISITORS\r\n\r\nGrenville came running across the rock-strewn terrace as if guided by\r\nsuperinstinct.  He fancied a sound like a heavy splash arose from the\r\nbase of the shadowy wall, and momentarily sickened to the bottom of his\r\nsoul with the thought that Elaine had fallen over.\r\n\r\nHe saw her darting towards him a moment later, however, and caught her\r\nprotectingly in his arms as she stumbled on a rock and plunged headlong\r\nagainst his breast.\r\n\r\nShe instantly regained her foothold and clung to his arm, brokenly\r\nstammering her story and facing back the way she had come to show where\r\nthe loathsome apparition had appeared above the brink.\r\n\r\nSidney hastened there at once, armed only with a stone.  Elaine, in a\r\nviolent tremble, stood a few feet only away, having followed in\r\nunabated dread.\r\n\r\nNot another sound could Grenville detect as he leaned above the\r\nprecipitous plunge attempting to pierce through the shadows and gloom,\r\nas he watched for some movement below.  Whether the man had fallen\r\nbackward from the lip, to go hurtling down through the darkness, or\r\nwhether he had accomplished some swift and silent retreat, Sidney had\r\nno means of ascertaining.  Only the ceaseless lap of the tide made a\r\nwhisper in the air.\r\n\r\nHe arose and returned to Elaine.\r\n\r\n\"I had no idea the cliff was scalable,\" he told her, quietly.  \"I doubt\r\nif that means of spying will be attempted again----  It was a beastly\r\nway of showing their intentions towards us, but I'm glad to know what\r\nto expect.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where has he gone?\" Elaine faintly chattered.  \"If he should only be\r\nwaiting to come again----  Such a horrible fright----  I don't know why\r\nI didn't faint, or what I did.  I'm so weak I can hardly walk.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you're as right a trivet!\" said Grenville, with a ready\r\ncomprehension of the need of keeping up her courage.  \"You can now\r\nretire with a comforting sense of having saved the night.\"\r\n\r\nBut Elaine's sense of comfort was a woefully negative quantity.  She\r\nwas shaken to the center of her nerves.  She dreaded to be left for a\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nGrenville, however, sent her off to bed in the most peremptory manner.\r\nA realizing sense that their trials had only well begun was his one\r\ndeeply settled conviction.\r\n\r\n\"Cheer up!\" he said to her, finally, \"the worst is still to come.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll try,\" she answered, courageously.  \"But please don't let it come\r\nto-night.\"\r\n\r\nFor more than two hours she did not sleep, or even close her eyes.\r\nThen she dragged her couch to a space outside her door.  Every movement\r\nmade by Grenville, as he watchfully policed the edge of the terrace,\r\nshe thus followed for a time, half rising beneath her tiger-skin rug in\r\nher dread to hear him go.\r\n\r\nWhen she finally slept she dreamed once more of the murderous eyes, the\r\nclenched white teeth, and the flame-shaped blade she had seen at the\r\nbrink of the cliff.  Grenville heard her laboredly call his name as in\r\nher dreams she once more underwent her disturbing ordeal, but he did\r\nnot move from his seat.\r\n\r\nAt dawn she was slumbering more peacefully, a smile on her lips as she\r\nlay there facing his position.  What a royal little princess of the\r\nisland she appeared with her colorful robe lying out upon the rocks,\r\nher hair so much more golden than the tawny hide, and the warm, healthy\r\nglow restored once more to her cheeks!\r\n\r\nGrenville was sure he had never half appreciated the wonder and\r\nabundance of her hair, the darker penciling of her arching brows, the\r\ndelicate beauty of her features.\r\n\r\nHe presently once more bent his attention on the island that rendered\r\nup never a sign.\r\n\r\nNeither the jungle, the summits of the further hills, nor the sea that\r\nstretched interminably about them enlightened his searching eyes.  Save\r\nfor that night experience, it might have seemed preposterous that\r\nenemies existed in the miniature world by which they were surrounded.\r\n\r\nHe crept in his cautious manner to the crumbling edge where Elaine had\r\nseen the face.  There was nothing below in the water.  He could readily\r\nfollow the bits of shelf and succession of pits in the wall, however,\r\nwhereby a daring, barefooted native might grope his way to the summit,\r\neven in the dark.  It would doubtless be possible here, he reflected,\r\nto explode a bomb against the pitted surface and break away so large a\r\ncavity as to render all future ascents impossible.  But this was a task\r\nto be deferred for a time, since he had no wish to acquaint the\r\nvisitors oversoon with the fact that he possessed an explosive.\r\n\r\nWhen he returned to the shelter again, Elaine had waked and carried her\r\ncouch to the cave.  Despite the fact the hour was early and the sun\r\nonly well above the ocean's rim, she declared she had rested much\r\nlonger than was either wise or essential.\r\n\r\nYet there was nothing to do for either, now that the day was begun.\r\nTheir breakfast of fruits was soon concluded, then of occupation there\r\nwas none.  Grenville felt it inadvisable to move about too freely on\r\nthe terrace, and thereby risk betraying the fact they were only two in\r\nnumber.  A watcher stationed on the second hill could not, as a matter\r\nof fact, examine the entire top of the terrace, or even discern its\r\nprincipal features, but he might ascertain decidedly too much, should\r\nthey carelessly expose themselves to view.\r\n\r\nThe morning proved for Grenville another exasperation.  He thought of\r\nnothing by way of labor he could advantageously perform.  Their\r\ndefense, though crude, was fairly complete, and could scarcely be\r\nimproved.  To watch the edge of the jungle, hour after hour, where\r\nnever a sign was vouchsafed his vigilance, was a dulling inactivity,\r\nyet a highly essential precaution that was not to be neglected.\r\n\r\nBy noon he was fairly in a mood to seek out the island's invaders\r\nalone, to hasten some definite action.  That the natives intended to\r\nstarve them into a visit to the spring seemed all too obvious.\r\nGrenville felt assured, however, the water down in the cavern would\r\nsuffice for their needs, if no better could be relied upon, when once\r\ntheir jars were empty, while gathering fruit would not be wholly\r\nimpossible under cover of the night.\r\n\r\nWith the thought in mind that only the trail would be kept under watch\r\nby the Dyaks, he made up his mind he could readily contrive a\r\nladder-like platform to extend from the brink, whereby the distance to\r\nthe nearest tree might be conveniently bridged to permit easy access to\r\nthe jungle.  Of creepers and extra bamboo poles he had laid in ample\r\nstock.  For the lack of better employment, he began the construction of\r\nhis bridge when their meager luncheon had been finished.\r\n\r\nHis mind, as he worked, spun schemes innumerable for the daily defeat\r\nof the natives.  Aware that as long as the terrace could be held\r\nstarvation and thirst would be their only unconquerable enemies, he\r\nentertained no end of plans for catching fish without bait and even\r\ntrapping or fishing up small animals that might rove at night below the\r\ncliff.  From these reflections he returned to the men who prowled about\r\nthem after dark.\r\n\r\nTo secure his cord across the trail and thereby provide an alarm, or\r\nnotice of the enemy's approach, from that direction, was a very simple\r\nmatter.  When he finally invented, in his mind, a singular \"rattle\" to\r\nguard the approach by the cliff, he dropped all employment on the\r\nbridge at once and began forthwith on the other.\r\n\r\nWhat he made was a series of bamboo buckets, or cuplike sections of the\r\nhollow tube, with stones suspended inside to knock against the walls\r\nwhen the things were lightly shaken.  These he intended to hang, one\r\nbeside another, in a line from the brink of the wall, where a climber\r\nmust strike them unawares and sound a resonant warning.\r\n\r\nBut he found, on hanging a pair some ten feet down along the face,\r\nwhere the man had climbed in the night, that the wind would sway them\r\nto and fro against the rock and constantly ring their hollow tones.\r\n\r\nThis defect he presently remedied by forming a frame, some ten feet\r\nlong and one foot wide, in which all his cups were suspended, or\r\nmoored, both top and bottom.  They were thus so lightly hung that the\r\nsmallest jar against the frame would joggle them all to musical\r\nutterance, while the wind could have no effect on any single one.\r\n\r\nThe entire frame was lowered down till it rested a bit unevenly on two\r\nprojecting shelves of rock, where it leaned a trifle outward like a\r\npicture on a wall, as the creepers that held it from falling were\r\nfinally made secure.  When Grenville, by way of a trial, nudged it once\r\nwith a pole thrust down against it for the purpose, it rattled out a\r\ndecisive alarm that one could have heard from the trail.\r\n\r\nGrenville thereupon brought out a bomb from his store and lowered it\r\ndown below the frame, and six or eight feet to the side.  This was\r\nsecured not only by the fuse, but likewise by more of the creeper.\r\n\r\nElaine, who during his absence had maintained the watch of the trail,\r\nnow ran to the place, at Grenville's signal, for a moment's inspection\r\nof the whole arrangement and instruction concerning its use.\r\n\r\nIt was while they were there that the haunting wail arose for a gasping\r\nspasm.  It had practically failed.  Sidney doubted if its loudest note\r\ncould have been heard as far as the spring.  But still the end of the\r\ntiresome day developed no attack.\r\n\r\nGrenville was completely puzzled by the tactics the boatmen had\r\nadopted.  That they knew Elaine was present on the terrace there could\r\nbe not a shadow of doubt.  Even if the man she had thrust away from the\r\ncliff-edge fell to the sea and was dashed to pieces, or drowned, his\r\nfriends who had brought him around to the place must have heard her\r\nvoice and recognized its feminine quality.\r\n\r\nThey would likewise know she could hardly be alone, and would guess her\r\ncompanions were not numerous or likely to be armed.  No plundered\r\nwreckage lay about the shore from which castaways could have drawn\r\nammunition or rifles.  It was utterly impossible for any ignorant\r\nnatives to imagine the loading of a cannon or the making of bombs from\r\nmaterials on the place.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, was the reason of their long delay?  They could scarcely be\r\nwaiting for reinforcements.  They would hardly be dreading the island's\r\n\"spirit\" now, since the sounds had practically ceased, and one man had\r\ndared ascend the cliff with a knife between his teeth.  That they\r\nfeared an open attack by day and dreaded the tiger by night was the\r\nonly tenable theory that Grenville could devise.\r\n\r\nYet the fact of the matter was that, until the cavern \"spirit\" should\r\nbe absolutely silenced, the superstitious Dyaks could only be forced by\r\nthe bulldozing threats and ferocity of their fiendish leader to set\r\nfoot upon the land.  It was he who had sent the climber up the wall,\r\nhaving thrust a pistol behind the fellow's ear.  A certain tragic\r\noutcome of this premature adventure had been wholly attributed by the\r\nvictim's companions to the anger of the wailing soul who inhabited the\r\nheadland.\r\n\r\nThe bridge, constructed of bamboo supports, was a simple affair,\r\ncompleted and ready by sunset.  Before the darkness was absolute,\r\nGrenville conveyed it along to the eastern jutting of the cliff, slid\r\nit down to a ledge below the level of the terrace, and easily thrust\r\nthe end across to the nearest tree, where it rested securely on the\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\nHe found that it bore his weight remarkably well.  With an ordinary\r\nlength of pliable ladder he could reach the ground beneath the tree\r\nwithout the slightest difficulty, thereby escaping all the undergrowth\r\nand broken rock that would render a straight descent from the brink not\r\nonly a noisy piece of business, but likewise one of considerable hazard\r\nand discomfort.  And descending thus, instead of employing the trail,\r\nhe could certainly expect to escape the shrewdest observation on the\r\npart of any native set to watch for some night adventure.\r\n\r\nIndeed, so alluring became the prospect of leaving the hill, to conduct\r\nsome helpful and informing explorations, that he could scarcely wait\r\nfor the shadows of night to settle on the island before he should test\r\nhis apparatus.\r\n\r\nElaine was frankly and confessedly alarmed when at length he could\r\nresist the temptation no longer and announced his intentions for\r\nexpending a portion of the evening.\r\n\r\nHe set an alarm at the gate on the trail, however, and, arming himself\r\nwith his heavy, cleaver-like implement for chopping, instructed his\r\nworried companion to fire the cannon without delay should attack\r\ndevelop in his absence.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure you will have no visitors, but, in case you do, don't wait\r\nto see who it is, or how many,\" he said; \"let the little gun count the\r\nnumbers.\"\r\n\r\n\"But suppose--it might be you!\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall not return that way.  You may look for me back in fifteen or\r\ntwenty minutes at the most.  I feel it's important to know what is\r\ngoing on, as well as to gather a bit of fruit, and see what I may be\r\nenabled to do by way of setting some traps for game.  If one of my\r\nsnares could be brought a trifle closer, it might provide us with the\r\nmeat we certainly ought to have.\"\r\n\r\nWithout another word, she watched him depart for his bridge and ladder\r\nto the jungle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nDEATH AS A BROTHER\r\n\r\nDespite the ease with which, in theory, he expected to descend to the\r\nground, Grenville was fully ten minutes escaping from the tree.\r\n\r\nA number of twigs that he could not have passed without creating a\r\ndisturbance he cut away with his knife.  His ladder was also badly\r\ncaught and stubbornly refused to be adjusted.  One violent rustling of\r\na heavy limb he caused when it finally slipped straight down, with his\r\nfeet all but striking on the ground.\r\n\r\nHe remained perfectly silent, ready for immediate retreat, regaining\r\nhis breath and straining his ears for the slightest sound, for a long,\r\nuneventful minute.  When he finally drew his sharp brass cleaver from\r\nhis pocket and started through the thicket, there was not the slightest\r\nsound in all the region about him, either of animals or men.\r\n\r\nInto one of the numerous wild creatures' trails he found his way with\r\ngreater ease because of his thorough familiarity with all that end of\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nThe trail, as he knew, led down by the spring, where a branch wound\r\nfirst towards the estuary and then across the bed of the rill, where it\r\ncut the path through the axis of the island.\r\n\r\nAlmost as noiselessly as one of the creatures hunted or hunting in the\r\nhours of blackest shadow, he made his way down to the rear of the pool,\r\nwhere he paused as before to listen.  The squeal of some little\r\nnocturnal beast and the patter of something paddling about in the water\r\nconvinced him at once the Dyaks were certainly not there, or else were\r\nmost skillfully hidden.\r\n\r\nWith a steadily increasing conviction that the boatmen would stick to\r\ntheir craft at night, he felt his boldness strengthen.  The importance\r\nof discovering the enemy's position was duly impressed on his mind.  He\r\nfelt that once he could gain the principal pathway down the island's\r\nlength he could follow the edge of a narrow bit of clearing, off to the\r\nleft of the rotting old barque, and thus arrive above the inlet, where\r\nhe was certain their vessel was concealed.\r\n\r\nNo less quietly than before he continued out around the spring, then\r\nturned to the left, in the narrow runway of the animals, and emerged\r\nbehind the estuary, where absolute stillness prevailed.\r\n\r\nHe presently fancied, as he slowly continued towards the old-time\r\nwreck, that a murmur of distant voices arose from off at the left.\r\nThis became a certainty when he reached his irregular clearing.\r\nMoreover, he was halfway only down this slope of rock and thicket when\r\nsimultaneously, out on the tide, some eighty or ninety feet apart, two\r\nmatches were lighted, as he could see, for pipes or cigarettes.\r\n\r\nElaine had been right!  There were two of the boats that were anchored\r\nhere together!\r\n\r\nBut, although more murmurs continued to arise, where a desultory\r\nconversation was from time to time renewed on either craft, he could by\r\nno means ascertain either the number of the Dyaks or what it was of\r\nwhich they talked.  Satisfied with what he had discovered, and certain\r\nnow the fellows were afraid to remain on the island after dark, he\r\nreturned up the slope with an easier stride, determined to see what\r\nmight be done by way of collecting some fruit.\r\n\r\nHe came once more to the main trail through the island, pausing to\r\nhearken once again as a sound of splashing in the inlet came\r\nuncertainly on the breeze.  Doubtless the crew had dipped a pail of\r\nwater, he thought, or thrown overboard some refuse from their dinner.\r\n\r\nHe had no more than headed again towards the hill where Elaine was\r\nwaiting, and swung about from the branch to the principal trail, when,\r\nwithout the slightest warning sound, he suddenly and heavily collided\r\nwith someone moving as noiselessly as himself in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nHe only saw that the man thus encountered was bare of shoulders and\r\ntaller than himself as he thrust out to fend the fellow off.  He knew\r\non the instant it was one of the boldest of the head-hunters, if not\r\nindeed their chief.\r\n\r\nThe fellow had grunted at the impact, and, quick to discover it was not\r\na member of the vessels' crews, abruptly sounded one triumphant yell as\r\nhe reached for his knife and lunged forward.\r\n\r\nThere were answering cries from a few feet only behind him--which\r\nGrenville heard as he crashed precipitately through the near-by thicket\r\nand made for the trail to the barque.\r\n\r\nThe hue and cry was instantly raised as the fellow pursuing came wildly\r\nthrough the jungle on his track.  Shouting instructions to his\r\nfollowing, this obvious leader of the prowling band continued as\r\nclosely as possible on Grenville's heels, while the others headed\r\nswiftly towards the estuary, convinced that their man would dart around\r\nand make for his camp on the hill.\r\n\r\nThe chief of the natives entertained the same belief, as Grenville\r\nimmediately comprehended.  Having planned exactly as they had supposed\r\nhe would, Sidney altered his course on the instant, dived down on\r\nall-fours in an animal path he had frequently followed before, and thus\r\ncrept noiselessly off to the left, once more towards the plundered\r\nwreck.\r\n\r\nAlmost at once an ominous silence reigned as before in the place.  The\r\nnatives, having soon missed their quarry, stood perfectly still, at\r\ncommand of their chief, to listen and gain a new guidance.\r\n\r\nTempted to put all possible distance between himself and his pursuers,\r\nGrenville continued on, a bit incautiously.  A branch he had thrust\r\nfrom before his face slipped back before he had intended its release.\r\nAt once the listening head-hunters plunged forward again in his\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Sidney retained his presence of mind and continued to\r\ncrawl on hands and knees, instead of attempting swifter flight through\r\nthe branches that closed above the trail.  With the sounds of his eager\r\nenemy approaching to a sweat-starting proximity, he dared lie perfectly\r\nmotionless on the earth, till he heard them quietly exploring as before\r\non the lines he must take to regain the terrace at the rear.\r\n\r\nAs silently now as a shadow, he wormed his way forward as before.  He\r\nhad gained perhaps a matter of twenty or thirty feet in this manner\r\nwhen, on coming at last to the edge of the clearing where the old\r\nbarque lay, he heard the natives beating back, convinced that he had\r\nnot passed.\r\n\r\nFor one moment only was he seized by indecision.  Then he darted across\r\nthe clearing unobserved and, slipping between the ribs of the wreck, as\r\nhe had on a previous occasion, went rapidly groping to the cabin, where\r\nsat the mummy-skeleton in chains.\r\n\r\nHe had not achieved this maneuver in absolute silence, having\r\nsacrificed something to speed.  Two of the head-hunters broke through\r\nthe fringe of the thicket with furtive swiftness, as he noted through a\r\nhole in the planks.  They were followed, a little further on, by the\r\ntall man first encountered, and later by a small but constantly moving\r\ncompanion, who disappeared again.\r\n\r\nAt a given signal two of the creatures ran swiftly about the barque,\r\none going in either direction.  They had evidently expected to corner\r\ntheir intended victim crouching behind the empty shell.  When they\r\npresently returned to their leader, a brief consultation was held.\r\n\r\nGrenville watched them breathlessly, aware that Elaine's position,\r\nalone on the hill, was tremendously jeopardized every moment he now\r\nremained away.  Should more of the Dyaks be summoned from the\r\nboats--the time would be short for prayers.\r\n\r\nConsiderably to his relief, the three dark figures resumed the search\r\nalong the edge of the clearing.\r\n\r\nThey were gone from sight for several minutes, and again returned,\r\napparently persuaded their quarry had not escaped them back to the\r\ncamp.  One even ventured to approach the barque and peer through its\r\nrotted ribs.\r\n\r\nGrenville had quietly moved aside, though the darkness would have\r\nshielded him completely.  When the fellow rejoined his companions\r\nagain, the chief issued new commands.  A brief expostulation followed.\r\nSidney was certain that one of two things portended.  Either the leader\r\nhad ordered his man to go down to the boats and compel a force to land\r\nand storm the now half-guarded hill, which the fellow argued was more\r\nthan he could do with Dyaks afraid of the darkness as well as the\r\nisland's spirit, or the order was--to board and search the wreck.\r\n\r\nEither was sufficiently disquieting, as Grenville controlled his\r\nbreathing and watched for the next development to follow.  He presently\r\nsaw the tall, bare-shouldered native strike his protesting follower a\r\nsavage blow across the face, thrusting something that gleamed against\r\nthe shaken creature's ear so soon as he had righted.\r\n\r\nThe craven was then ready to obey.  He accepted something that\r\nGrenville could not see, doubtless another revolver, and came forward\r\nas if to enter the old ship's hull--but not through the hole in her\r\nside.  Meantime, the fourth of the party had once more appeared from\r\nthe growth.  He apparently suggested that crews from the vessels be\r\nsummoned, doubtless to attack the hill.  Also he presumably volunteered\r\nto go and compel their attendance on their chief.  His gestures and\r\nthose of the leader, as they thus conversed in murmurs, were all\r\ntowards the inlet where the boats were anchored or towards the distant\r\nhill.\r\n\r\nHe who had plainly been commanded to enter and search the wreck took\r\nadvantage of the colloquy to linger with the group.  It was not until\r\nthe small and active demon of the lot had darted away to land more men\r\nthat the chief once more turned his attention to the coward.\r\n\r\nWhining his impotent excuses and expostulations, the fellow\r\naffrightedly climbed upon the deck and was ordered to explore the\r\ncabin.  That he might be killed by the desperate white man possibly\r\nhiding in the vessel's hold, the chief was well aware.  The sacrifice\r\nof a man more or less was unimportant--provided the quarry was thereby\r\ndiscovered in a hole where he could not escape.\r\n\r\nThis fact was fully appreciated by two other persons concerned.  One of\r\nthese persons was Grenville, the second the terrified native.  This\r\nshivering wretch, who had known for years of the terrible guardian\r\nsitting in iron chains within, blundered noisily about in the upper\r\nquarters, so afraid he could have offered no defense to a child's\r\nattack.\r\n\r\nGrenville was undecided as to what he were wiser to do.  To sink his\r\ncleaver through the Dyak's skull would presently be comparatively\r\nsimple.  And, should absolutely silent death overtake this miserable\r\nslave of the man outside, the moral effect might be of value.  It might\r\nbe supposed by his companions he had died of fright alone.  Yet Sidney\r\nargued that any fate whatsoever silencing the fellow now might be\r\nconstrued as proof of his own presence in the wreck.\r\n\r\nInstantly deciding that, once they concluded he was not here, the Dyaks\r\nwould leave and permit his escape, Grenville silently crept to the open\r\ndoor beside the dead man held in chains, slipped behind the rotted old\r\npartition, and, without a sound, replaced the door almost as he had\r\noriginally found it.\r\n\r\nThe chief had meantime approached the barque, to order his man to the\r\nhold.  To the musty cabin where \"Buli\" sat, the fellow was forced to\r\nstumble.  Some report he quavered in accents of terror was not received\r\nwith favor, and a new command was issued.\r\n\r\nGrenville made ready to drop the man, should he dare push open the\r\ndoor.  He was certain the craven had been ordered to this fatal\r\nexploration.  But, instead, the whining demon lighted a match, to\r\nreveal all the contents of the place.\r\n\r\nBy the yellow light both this fellow and the leader, peering through\r\nthe side, met the vacant stare of \"Buli's\" eyes--and both were\r\nfrightened to utterance.  The chief's brief note was a rigmarole of\r\ncharm, to avert the evil eye.  His slave's shrill performance was a\r\nscream, as the fellow reeled back, stumbling blindly away and falling\r\nas he went.\r\n\r\nThe pistol he carried was discharged.  The fellow was wounded in the\r\nhip.  His groans, as he dragged himself out on the deck, were drowned\r\nby the curses of the leader.\r\n\r\nThis dominant brute, having noticed the door where Sidney stood\r\nconcealed, now ordered the second of his men to explore where the first\r\nhad failed.  As Grenville once more looked out through a ragged hole to\r\nobserve the proceedings, this second fellow began a somewhat stouter\r\nobjection than his predecessor had done, but was even more promptly\r\ncowed or persuaded to submission.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the cries of a horde of Dyaks from the boats arose from the\r\njungle below.  They had evidently landed with considerable willingness\r\nof spirit, as Grenville was thoroughly aware.  He thought of Elaine\r\nwith a sudden sinking of the vitals.  No sooner had the second of the\r\nnatives started to mount to the deck, where number one still lay\r\ngroaning, than a wild idea shot into Sidney's mind.  At any cost, he\r\nmust make one dash for the hill.\r\n\r\nHe quietly slipped to the cabin again, where \"Buli\" had long been\r\ncaptain and crew of the barque.  The one brief glance he bestowed,\r\nthrough the hole, on the leader of the murderous demons, now hastening\r\nto the place, showed that ingenious savage standing perhaps a rod away\r\nand calling to the on-coming crews.\r\n\r\nThe fellow on deck was making sufficient noise to mask a fair\r\ndisturbance in the cabin.  Taking instant advantage of this fact,\r\nGrenville groped downward with his hands--and encountered \"Buli\"\r\npromptly.\r\n\r\n\"I need your services, brother,\" he murmured, grimly, and, finding the\r\nchain that shackled the sitting skeleton, he placed one foot upon its\r\nupper end and tore the staple entirely out of the rotten wood it\r\npierced.\r\n\r\nBodily lifting the mummified thing in his arms, he hastened forward, to\r\nthe hole that he alone had dared to utilize, broken through the\r\ndecaying hulk, where he passed first his burden and then himself\r\nbetween the ancient ribs.\r\n\r\nA cry had been sounded from within the barque.  The chief of the Dyaks\r\nsuddenly turned and rushed, knife in hand, upon the man he beheld\r\nescaping from the hold.\r\n\r\nGrenville waited for him, deliberately.  Just as the fellow lunged\r\nactively forward, Sidney thrust the hideous effigy of a human being\r\ninto the arms and against the face of his wildly stabbing assailant and\r\nnimbly leaped towards the trail.\r\n\r\nA sound of horror broke from the Dyak's lips as he rolled on the earth\r\nwith the skeleton rattling down upon him.  But a brief time only was he\r\nprostrate there with his terror.  Uttering screams as shrill as a\r\nwoman's and darting swiftly to meet his crew of men, who suddenly\r\nswarmed from the thicket, he headed a wild, fanatic pursuit where\r\nGrenville was speeding for the terrace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nTHE GIRL BEHIND THE GUN\r\n\r\nAlone on the hill, and already strung to the highest tension of dread\r\nby Grenville's long absence, after what he had said of a prompt return,\r\nElaine had been struck with alarm to the core of her being, as the\r\nvarious sounds came clearly up from the jungle about the disintegrated\r\nwreck.\r\n\r\nIt was fears for Sidney, not for herself, that had finally possessed\r\nher fluttering heart as the muffled shot and subsequent cries floated\r\nuncertainly from down there in the darkness.  She knew that Grenville\r\nhad no gun, and was, therefore, certain it was he who must have\r\nsuffered a wound.\r\n\r\nWith a blazing torch she had run to the edge of the terrace, to light\r\nSidney home, if, by any bare chance, he had escaped.  She was there,\r\ntransfixed by apprehension, when at length, with cries like a pack of\r\nwolves, the Dyaks came racing towards the clearing.\r\n\r\nMeantime Grenville had gained a considerable lead of the devils on his\r\nheels, and, on passing the spring, had caught a glimpse of Elaine with\r\nher brand of fire.  He paused for a second to shout essential\r\ndirections, lest she might have forgotten in her plight.\r\n\r\n\"Don't fire, Elaine, till you see them on the trail!\"\r\n\r\nWith that he darted abruptly to the left, for the animal trail that\r\nwould lead him to his ladder.  He had no more than gained it when, with\r\na chorus of demoniac yells and screams of triumph, the straggling\r\npursuers broke madly into the clearing and darted across it for the\r\ntrail.\r\n\r\nEven then, afraid that Elaine might fail to perform her allotted task,\r\nGrenville sped up his ladder like a creature of the wild, and came to\r\nthe end of his platform.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks were immediately storming the barrier, the breach of which\r\nwas promptly discovered, and Sidney's alarm was jerkily resounding.\r\n\r\nLike a spirit of maternity, nerved to any ordeal by the sense of\r\nprotecting one she loved, Elaine crouched low beside the cannon, her\r\ndilated eyes intent upon the trail.  She had clung to a hope that\r\nGrenville might yet appear in time to take charge of the gun.  But\r\nsuddenly now, to her terror, four or more figures darkly appeared on\r\nthe ledge above the gate, coming swiftly towards her position.\r\n\r\nShe thrust the torch desperately down upon the fuse, saw the powder\r\nspew out a shower of sparks, and rolled and tumbled hotly from the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nShe was suddenly agonized by the thought that the thing would fail, but\r\nGrenville had barely reached the solid rock when the cannon abruptly\r\nthundered.\r\n\r\nA wide-spreading cataract of fire was projected in a red-and-yellow\r\ncone across the space between the brink and the wall behind the trail,\r\nas the powder poured its punishment into the ranks of the creatures\r\nleaping upward to destruction.  The detonation, sharp, crisp,\r\nappallingly loud in the stillness of the island, fairly stunned Elaine,\r\nnow kneeling helplessly among the rocks.\r\n\r\nShrieks of dismay and sudden agony immediately succeeded the explosion,\r\nwhile its echoes still rattled wildly back from the distant hills of\r\nrock.  In the utter darkness, by contrast following the one brief\r\nglare, there was nothing to be seen along the path.  But wounded men\r\nwere staggering downward, in blind retreat, already abandoned by their\r\nunscathed companions, in flight below the gate.\r\n\r\nGrenville had run to his store of bombs, instead of coming straight to\r\nthe gun.  He meant to be prepared against a second attack.  As his\r\nactive figure now appeared where he hastened brinkward, watching both\r\ntrail and clearing, Elaine beheld him at last.  She arose and stumbled\r\ntowards him, her feet still heavy with her dread, her heart wildly\r\nleaping in joy.\r\n\r\n\"Were you shot?\" she cried.  \"Are you hurt?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, right as a fiddler!\" he assured her, quickly, glancing down at the\r\nshadowy path.  \"I only wish I could bait them again and lead the\r\nremainder to the gun!\"\r\n\r\nHe charged the piece at once, having brought for the purpose a bamboo\r\ncanister of powder, open and heaping at the end.  This he thrust\r\ncomplete down the muzzle of the cannon, to be rammed home with dozens\r\nof his slugs.\r\n\r\nCries still arose from the jungle, more faintly, now, as the Dyaks\r\nretreated down the island.  Excitement still rang in the air.  Neither\r\nGrenville nor Elaine felt certain the attack would not be renewed.\r\nThere was something dark that Sidney could see, crawling painfully down\r\nthe incline of the trail, assisting something more inert.  He purposely\r\nshielded Elaine from the sight, lest she understand too well.  He much\r\npreferred that the Dyaks recover their possible slain from about the\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nElaine was still too tensely wrought for reaction.  She could hardly\r\nunderstand how the situation had been changed so abruptly from attack\r\ninto utter rout.  Her ears were still ringing from the cannon's\r\ndeafening roar.  She had taken no time to comprehend the results of\r\nwhat she had accomplished.\r\n\r\n\"How shall we know if they do come back?\" she questioned, excitedly.\r\n\"They probably broke the alarm.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll repair it soon.  Did it ring?  But, of course, you couldn't have\r\ntaken time to hear.  Did you understand me when I shouted?\"\r\n\r\n\"I heard it, horribly shaken,\" said Elaine.  \"I heard so many awful\r\nnoises.  I heard you call, of course.  But, perhaps, I didn't wait long\r\nenough, after all.  I don't seem to remember.  I waited as long as I\r\ncould.  I hope I only frightened them away!\"  She sat down, overtaken\r\nat last by weakness in her limbs.\r\n\r\nThe torch she had used had fallen from her hand.  It barely smoldered\r\non the rocks.  Grenville extinguished it completely, then continued to\r\nprime the cannon as before, with powder sprinkled on the vent, and a\r\nfuse laid for several feet along the ledge.  He was glad to note the\r\nlittle piece had been securely held in place upon its log by its\r\nwrappings and the weight of heavy stones.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go down and examine the gate,\" he said, aware that, though the\r\nDyaks had undoubtedly suffered severely, a still attack might yet be\r\nattempted in the dark.  Therefore, leaving Elaine to recover as best\r\nshe might, he was soon moving cautiously along the narrow ledge.\r\n\r\nThe night had precipitated war.  That he and Elaine would be called\r\nupon to endure war's customary hazards, hardships, and horrors he was\r\ngrimly ready to concede.  She had made an amazingly fine beginning.  It\r\nwas certainly not the time for him to weaken her now by misplaced\r\ntenderness, vastly as he wished to spare her shock and trial.\r\n\r\nThe crawling objects he had seen from above had vanished beyond the\r\nsolid wall he had built to shut out the tiger.  All the way down to\r\nthis barrier he made his way, Elaine meanwhile watching from the cliff.\r\nThere were dark, irregular blotches here and there along the rocks, and\r\non these he scraped a hiding film of dust.  How much of the contents of\r\nthe gun had been expended uselessly against the wall could not be\r\ndetermined in the dark.  He felt assured a heavy toll had been\r\ncollected on the trail, if not in killed, at least in wounded and,\r\ndoubtless, disabled men.\r\n\r\nThe cord arranged to sound his alarm had been broken in the charge.  He\r\nfound the ends, repaired the damage, crept further along to scan the\r\nsilent and deserted clearing, then promptly returned to secure a\r\nbasket, and boldly went down to gather extra fruit.\r\n\r\n\"I wish I knew where to get some meat,\" he told Elaine, as he came with\r\nhis plunder to the terrace.  \"I don't know when I shall have another\r\nhour so absolutely safe.\"\r\n\r\nBut beyond removing his ladder and bridge, he performed no more labor\r\nthat night.  It was not yet late.  Elaine was too excited to retire.\r\nShe sat with him, nervously listening to all the far sounds of the\r\njungle, as he kindled their fire to a blaze.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder how long we can keep it up--go on as we are going now,\" she\r\nreflected aloud at last.  \"Mustn't they get us in the end?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--not till we've made it a fair exchange, at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"There must be a dozen of them about us, six or more to our one.\"\r\n\r\n\"There were, perhaps, an hour ago, but hardly so many now.  One shot\r\nhimself, down in the jungle, gunning for me, while the cannon----  But\r\nyour intuition was accurate--a second boatload did arrive to join the\r\nfirst.\"  He added a brief recital of what he had seen and what had\r\ntaken place at the rotted barque, sparing the details which, he felt,\r\nwould more alarm than assure her, respecting \"Buli\" and the drama\r\nplayed at the clearing.\r\n\r\n\"Two boatloads!\" she repeated.  \"What reason could they possibly have\r\nfor coming at last to this island?  They couldn't have known we were\r\nhere--at least not the first who came.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Grenville, slowly, reflecting that the time for his\r\nrevelation was, perhaps, a trifle overdue, \"they came, I believe, to\r\nsecure the treasure in the cave.\"\r\n\r\nElaine glanced up at him quickly.\r\n\r\n\"The treasure you have joked about before?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was not altogether a joke.  The treasure is there--or, at least, it\r\nwas, before I removed it to the passage.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not something actually valuable?  What sort of things do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gold and precious stones--a lot of heavy plunder--enough of the jewels\r\nalone to fill a hat.\"\r\n\r\nElaine slightly gasped.  \"And they came for that?  And you have taken\r\nit out--have hidden it, rather--and you think, perhaps, they have\r\nmissed it?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I hardly believe they have been to the cave as yet.  It isn't\r\ntheirs, the beggars!  Not that it's of any account to us, but I don't\r\nfeel sure if I gave it up they'd depart and leave us in peace.  At any\r\nrate, I don't propose they shall have it.\"\r\n\r\nElaine was silent for a moment, and filled with wonder.\r\n\r\n\"How did you manage to find it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Entirely by accident.  I pulled down a stone that concealed a secret\r\nchamber, where someone had walled it in.  It has doubtless been there\r\nfor many generations--as these fellows have probably known.\"\r\n\r\n\"And suppose they find the chamber looted--may they not be all the more\r\nsavage and eager to tear us to pieces?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well--I should say their ambition in that respect has already about\r\nreached its limit.\"\r\n\r\nElaine could still feel her heart pounding heavily in her bosom.  She\r\nreturned to her original query.\r\n\r\n\"If we go on like this for a week, what then?  Is there anything in the\r\nworld to prevent them from waiting and waiting and waiting, till----\"\r\nShe did not finish her sentence, but the slightest shudder shook her\r\nframe.\r\n\r\n\"They were goaded to action to-night,\" said Grenville, hopefully.\r\n\"They may feel sufficiently aggrieved to return for more.  If not--they\r\nmust be invited.\"\r\n\r\n\"But surely you'll not attempt such a venture as this again?\"\r\n\r\nGrenville rubbed at his jaw.  \"I wish it might be duplicated!  No such\r\nluck is likely.  But I feel very certain we'd both rather cash in\r\nfighting than to starve like rats in a trap.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Elaine faltered, in her quiet way of courage, \"but--if it has to\r\ncome--let's try to--receive it here together.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nDYAK DARTS AND METHODS\r\n\r\nLong-distance fighting began an hour after sunrise in the morning.  It\r\nwas rather a long-distance attack, since Grenville, armed only with the\r\ncannon, was powerless to retaliate, except at great expense of\r\nammunition, and with questionable results.\r\n\r\nOne of the Dyaks had stationed himself on the central hill of the\r\nisland with some sort of ancient rifle.  He took a deliberate shot at\r\nSidney the moment that unsuspecting thorn in their sides chanced to\r\nmake an appearance on the western section of the terrace.  The bullet\r\nwent wide, having struck among the rocks some fifteen feet away,\r\narousing Grenville's contempt.\r\n\r\nNot even Elaine was greatly frightened by this overture from the enemy,\r\nwhose marksman could have but a limited view of that unused section of\r\nthe headland.\r\n\r\nBut the first small dart that sped lightly up from the jungle, to drop\r\nalmost at Grenville's feet, was another affair altogether.  He knew the\r\nthing was not only sharp, but literally soaked with poison.  It had\r\nonly to prick through the skin of one's hand, or even, perhaps, through\r\nthe thinness of their garments, to perform its deadly function.  The\r\nmerest chance shot was thus extremely likely to achieve what the\r\nrifleman could not.\r\n\r\nThese hideous little messengers of agony and death were rained all\r\nmorning on the terrace.  They fell near the furnace for keeping fire;\r\nthey dropped by the door of the shelter.  A few even sped as far as the\r\npowder magazine, where Grenville found them on the rock and gravel roof.\r\n\r\nAmple protection was afforded by remaining under cover, but this was\r\nnot altogether wise or safe, except, perhaps, for Elaine.  Grenville\r\nfelt he must constantly watch the clearing.  In the light of day his\r\nalarm could be discovered and removed, to permit an attack too sudden\r\nto be opposed.\r\n\r\nHe, therefore, constructed a bamboo shield, with which to protect his\r\nhead and a part of his body, as he moved about among the rocks, or\r\nconcealed himself near the cannon.\r\n\r\nNot more than twice in all the morning did he see so much as one of the\r\ntubes--the long, slender blowguns of the hidden foe--while this silent\r\nbombardment continued.  It was useless to think of slewing about his\r\nlittle brass piece for a shot at mere motionless jungle.  It was\r\nequally impossible, he confessed, to excite the Dyaks to another charge\r\nuntil they should finally make up their minds a sudden assault would\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\nHe was rather surprised they had made no attempt to rush him at\r\nearliest dawn.  The ledge was, however, very narrow.  It afforded the\r\none and only approach, and the dire disaster of the night before had\r\nrendered far more cowardly the set of treacherous and utterly craven\r\nmurderers these boatmen undoubtedly were.\r\n\r\nAll afternoon the darts continued falling, intermittently--and\r\nGrenville made no response.  His silence, indeed, was a mystery which\r\nthe Dyaks not only failed to understand, but, likewise, a little\r\ndreaded.  That he had no rifle they were thoroughly convinced.  But\r\nthat roar of his cannon they had understood, and to hear it again they\r\nhad no appetite.  Moreover, its deadly hail and detonation had come so\r\nunexpectedly, from the erstwhile silent terrace, that they knew not\r\nwhat to expect concerning the future.\r\n\r\nNot without hopes of actually slaying some of the unknown forces on the\r\ncrest of the hill, they shot an exceptional number of their darts from\r\nthe nearby thicket as the sun at last declined.  Grenville, having at\r\nlength established what he thought to be a line of the little missiles'\r\nflight, hastily made and bound up a bomb of no more than two pounds'\r\nweight.\r\n\r\nThis, with a fuse too short for ordinary safety, he finally carried to\r\nthe westward brink with one of his glowing coals of fire.\r\n\r\nThe patient rifleman, waiting on his hill, immediately blazed away, as\r\nbefore--and missed the entire bulk of rock.  Grenville paid not even\r\nthe tribute of a glance at the opposite summit, as he thrust his fuse\r\ndown upon his coal.\r\n\r\nThe hiss of the powder gave him a start, so swiftly did it travel\r\ntowards the bomb.  With all his might he threw the thing outward at the\r\nshadowed spot whence he thought the darts were flying.\r\n\r\nThe quick, sharp bark and the patch of flame behind the design of a\r\npalm leaf, came like a clap of thunder, just before the second when the\r\nbomb would have struck on the earth.\r\n\r\nA yell of dismay, or anguish, or both, and a scattering shower of\r\nshredded greenery supplied the only report of results that Grenville\r\nwas destined to receive.  The flight of darts was ended.  A few hurried\r\nmovements in the thicket, and a groan that Sidney felt was smothered,\r\nwere the only signs vouchsafed him that the powder had not been cheaply\r\nwasted.\r\n\r\n\"It's a poor way to fight the hidden devils,\" he told Elaine, as he\r\ncame once more to the shelter, \"but it may possibly serve to keep them\r\nfurther away, and force them to different tactics.\"\r\n\r\nIt certainly had this latter effect, but not immediately.\r\n\r\nThere was no attack that night, and no disturbance in the jungle,\r\nthough Sidney descended to the thicket and returned, not only with more\r\nfresh fruit he had located during the day, but also with a small wild\r\nhog he had captured in one of the older traps which the Dyaks had\r\nfailed to discover.\r\n\r\nThe morning developed nothing aggressive, save the presence of the\r\nmarksman on hill number two with the rifle that Grenville said would\r\nonly be deadly around a corner.  Some plan of patient waiting appeared\r\nto have been matured in the Dyaks' mind, since one of their boats\r\nissued forth at last from its place, to circle about the headland like\r\na vulture atilt for prey, while down in the cover of the greenery other\r\nnatives undoubtedly lurked.\r\n\r\nThey affrighted a flock of parrots here and there, from time to time,\r\nor set the timid monkeys to chattering and leaping through the upper\r\nfoliage, apprising Grenville thus that the thickets were haunted below.\r\nNo darts sped upward from the jungle edge, however, which, Sidney\r\nargued, might signify that the men with the deadly blow-guns possibly\r\nhoped to excite over-confidence in the keepers of the terrace, who\r\nmight finally expose themselves to fewer, but more accurate, shots.\r\n\r\nIn his forced inactivity, Grenville once more waxed impatient.  He felt\r\nthe heat of the blazing sun, which was daily growing more intense.  He\r\nchafed at the thought of doing nothing while their water supply was\r\nsteadily diminishing, and the Dyaks apparently planned to subdue him by\r\nthirst or famine.  He dared not risk an exposure of the door to the\r\nsecret passage by going for water to the cave below, especially as all\r\nhis jugs were porous and permitted the water's escape by percolation,\r\nwhereas the supply in the basins below might be better preserved where\r\nit was.\r\n\r\nA hundred useless plans for taking the war to the enemy's camp were\r\npresented to his mind, always to be promptly abandoned.  He could only\r\nutilize his artillery for defense, and could not even hasten an attack.\r\nHe could devise no means of ascertaining how many of the natives had\r\neither been killed or disabled.  That fully ten survived, however, he\r\nfelt was probable.  One or two at the most was all the little cannon\r\nwould be likely to rake in a charge.\r\n\r\nEarly in the afternoon there was ample evidence of exceptional activity\r\ndown in the heavy jungle growth, though none of the Dyaks was seen.\r\nThe movements of birds and animals, as well as the swaying of branches\r\nor trees in various thickets under the cliff, sufficiently advertised\r\nthe facts.\r\n\r\nGrenville was puzzled to understand what might be occurring, till, at\r\nlength, he discovered that some of the fruit-bearing trees, on which he\r\nhad counted for supplies, had been quietly denuded of their burdens, or\r\neven altogether destroyed.  One large banana palm with fruit of\r\nexceptional quality, he even beheld as it toppled to the earth, where\r\nsome fiendish head-hunter hacked through its fibrous trunk.\r\n\r\nSomething sank in his breast as he witnessed this atrocious vandalism,\r\nand realized his helplessness to avert the oncoming famine of himself\r\nand the girl in his charge.  That the spring would be guarded, night\r\nand day, was, of course, a foregone conclusion.  And not even a plan\r\nfor goading the Dyaks to another attack came in working order to his\r\nbrain.\r\n\r\nThat was a thoroughly disheartening day, sultry, and fraught with\r\nmenace from all directions, as the Dyak craft continued to hover about\r\nupon the sea, and the pillaging continued in the thickets.  All the\r\nwork was, moreover, silent, grim, and ominous, with once in a while a\r\ndart spinning swiftly up from the tangle below, or, from time to time,\r\nan echoing shot coming from the opposite height with a bullet singing\r\ncrazily by, or ripping along the rocks.\r\n\r\nSidney made no attempt to descend that night, aware of the folly of an\r\nexploration into the enemy's lines, and the utter impossibility of\r\ndiscovering fruit in a nearer portion of the jungle.  His entire wild\r\nhog had been roasted.  For, perhaps, two days the meat might keep, in\r\nthe coolness of the passage to the cave.\r\n\r\nOnce more the night was uneventful, and silent.  Once more came the\r\nday, and a blazing hot sun poured unveiled caloric on the summit of the\r\nterrace, where sultriness drank up the water that oozed through the\r\nsubstance of the jugs.\r\n\r\n\"I've got to do something,\" Sidney declared.  \"We can't go on like\r\nthis.\"  Elaine was already denying herself the food and water she\r\nrequired.  \"I shall try to invent some means of enticing the creatures\r\nto the cave below--and, perhaps, explode a mine.  If the watchers on\r\nthat hovering ship saw me disappear in the hole, it is rather more than\r\nlikely they would follow, thinking they had me bottled.\"\r\n\r\nElaine always manifested interest, no matter what his scheme.\r\n\r\n\"But how could that possibly be managed, now that you haven't your\r\nraft?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think by a ladder and platform, the ladder anchored as we had it the\r\nday I came up with your assistance, and the platform arranged of bamboo\r\npoles, which I can carry down through the passage.  It will take me\r\nsome time to get it ready--but something has got to be done.\"\r\n\r\nElaine's eyes brightened with hope.\r\n\r\n\"Please say there is something I can do to help,\" she begged.  \"You\r\nwork so hard and constantly.\"\r\n\r\n\"There will be rather warm employment for us both,\" he assured her, in\r\nhis former way of cheer, \"particularly towards the end.\"\r\n\r\nHe brought his neglected ladder to the shelter, where Elaine was\r\npresently as busy as himself, rewinding the rungs in the creepers, and\r\ntesting it all for strength.  Just what his final plan would be she did\r\nnot understand, but her confidence in his ability and resourcefulness\r\nwas almost wholly without bounds.\r\n\r\nThe usual vigilance was not for a moment neglected, but nothing\r\noccurred in the world below, save a repetition of the former day's\r\nactivity on the part of the unseen natives.  It was not until well in\r\nthe afternoon that the Dyaks' plan developed.\r\n\r\nA breeze had sprung up from the north, bringing gushes of heat and\r\njungle fragrance across the summit of the hill.  Then, at length, as if\r\nthis steadying wind was the final agency for which they had waited, the\r\nDyaks set up a queer, wild chant from various places in the thicket.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later a cloud of smoke arose from one of their centers.\r\nThis was followed by several more.  A huge, thick smudge was soon\r\nrising upward from the earth, and rolling on the breeze to envelop all\r\nthe headland.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks had gathered enormous quantities of resinous wood, and had\r\ndeliberately fired the jungle!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nA BATTLE IN THE SMOKE\r\n\r\nNo doubts could be for long entertained as to what the smudge was\r\nexpected to accomplish.  Its dense and suffocating fumes not only\r\nrendered a further watch upon the clearing or the trail practically\r\nuseless, but it seemed to Grenville highly improbable that he or Elaine\r\ncould for long survive the pungent reek they were soon obliged to\r\nbreathe.\r\n\r\nThere were two slight elements only in their favor.  One was the\r\npassageway, through the rock, where clean fresh air was constantly\r\nflowing upward; the other was the very breeze itself that swept the\r\nsmoke upon them.  It frequently split the cloud of black and gray upon\r\ntwo juttings of the headland, or even beat it down and mingled its own\r\noverheated but acceptable ozone with the otherwise stifling fume.\r\n\r\nAnger and horror together had lodged in Grenville's being.  That the\r\nDyaks would soon attempt a sneak upon them, under cover of the cloud,\r\nhe felt was as certain as that hideous death must be their portion,\r\nwere this business sufficiently prolonged.  Even retirement to the\r\ncavern could avail them nothing but a short delay of the fate they must\r\nfinally face when their food and water should be presently exhausted.\r\n\r\nUnder cover of the drifting smudge, he sent Elaine to the passage.  As\r\nlong as a breath remained in his lungs he resolved he would not desert\r\nhis post, where he waited for attack by the trail.  To permit the\r\nfiends to swarm upon the terrace, destroy or capture his powder and the\r\ngun, and prison himself and Elaine in the narrow gallery, was a thought\r\nthat aroused him through and through.\r\n\r\nAll further contemplation of his scheme for alluring the Dyaks to the\r\ncavern was necessarily abandoned.  The most he could do was to watch as\r\nbefore, and, perhaps, convey his bombs and stores to the passage, as\r\ntime and his highly essential vigilance permitted.\r\n\r\nBack and forth through the smoke he moved upon the hill, seeking the\r\nbetter air that came occasionally through the billows, and listening\r\nintently for the faintest sound from the always ready alarm.  When an\r\nhour had gone and no attack had developed, his heart underwent a new\r\ndespair.  He began to doubt that the Fates would supply him an\r\nopportunity for further retaliation on the fiends below, who could\r\nfinally overcome him with the fumes.\r\n\r\nThe drift of smoke was intermittently broken, near the trail, where\r\napparently a current of wind that assumed a rotation as it rose through\r\na half-round niche of considerable dimensions in the wall, swept\r\nvertically upward to lift the billowing cloud.  Thus for at least a\r\nportion of the time Grenville could glimpse the ledge behind the trail\r\nwhere besiegers must finally pass.\r\n\r\nSo dense became the reek, however, that he feared his post must soon\r\nbecome insupportable.  There was neither time nor air in which to\r\narrange a longer fuse, which, as a matter of fact, would be too long\r\nfor accurate work with the gun.\r\n\r\nHe knew at last the hour was nearing sunset, and silence still seemed\r\nto roll with the smoke across the enveloped terrace.  His eyes were\r\nburningly filled with water; his head had begun to ache.  He went\r\nweakly over towards the gallery, intent upon breathing a little fresher\r\nair before resuming his duties.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, above the ringing in his ears, came a sound from his gate\r\nalarm.  Its deep hollow tone was strangely resonant in all that blanket\r\nof smoke.  He darted back, where lay his bombs and the short fuse laid\r\nto the cannon.\r\n\r\nThe smudge had, unfortunately, fallen like a pall, concealing all the\r\ntrail.  It lifted slightly, however, as a fog may lift over waters,\r\nrevealing one half-seen form upon the ledge.\r\n\r\nThen, in the second that Grenville laid his fire to the powder, his\r\nsecond alarm, from the frame of bamboo buckets, hung behind him on the\r\nwall, rattled out its xylophonic warning.  The head-hunting demons,\r\nfront and rear, were practically upon him!\r\n\r\nHe fired the gun.  Its orange flame shot out through the smoke in\r\nragged spears, mingling the fume of imperfect powder with all that reek\r\nfrom the jungle.\r\n\r\nA gap was apparently torn in the rolling cloud, to be filled with a\r\ndenser substance.  Nothing could possibly be discerned where the charge\r\nmust have splattered on the wall.  There were cries in the air, but\r\nwhether from pain, or the Dyaks' exultation, Grenville could never have\r\ntold.\r\n\r\nAware that the demons were capable of sacrificing some of their number\r\nto the gun, to beget its discharge, and thus clear the way for\r\nconcerted attack by greater numbers, Grenville promptly lighted the\r\nfuse of a bomb and hurled it from him down the trail.\r\n\r\nIt burst in the smoke, its red blot of fire a lurid illumination in the\r\nblack and gray billows from the smudge.  Again a cry succeeded, this\r\none unquestionably voicing some wretch's mortal agony in the\r\nall-concealing fume.\r\n\r\nWithout for a moment pausing, Grenville plunged swiftly through the\r\ndrifting envelope, to gain the brink at the rear.  He caught up a rock\r\nas he stumbled half blindly onward, and blew on the fire of his brand.\r\n\r\nA thicker shroud of the reek revolved about him, halting him there to\r\ngasp for breath, which he stooped in the hope of finding.  He dropped\r\nthe stone as a useless burden.  Once more he staggered onward--and\r\nblundered against a Dyak, more blinded than himself!\r\n\r\nThe creature had scaled the wall despite the bamboo framework and its\r\ncups, or wooden bells!  He and Sidney were instantly locked in a fierce\r\nand deadly embrace!\r\n\r\nA battle as silent as it was swift and ferocious was curtained there in\r\nthe smoke.\r\n\r\nThat the edge was near was a knowledge equally shared, as each man\r\nwrestled in desperate violence to overcome his antagonist and hurl him\r\ndown to the sea.\r\n\r\nMore by instinct than design, Grenville had paused to grip his\r\nfirebrand hotly between his teeth.  He had seen that the head-hunter\r\nheld a knife, which was instantly turned, as the boatman writhed in\r\nSidney's arms, in an effort to sink it to the hilt.\r\n\r\nGrenville, however, clutched the wiry wrist with all his might, and\r\ntried to fetch it upward for a quickly planned maneuver.  It slipped\r\nfrom his grip, and together he and the native froze more savage than\r\nbefore.  The Dyak once more attempted a stabbing pass, and Sidney again\r\ncaught the sinewy hand, in a clutch that he knew must fail.\r\n\r\nThe wrist left his impotent fingers like a snake.  The whole arm\r\nwrithed backward for the stroke.  Sidney abruptly leaned forward,\r\nturning his head, and jabbed the red-hot firebrand against the Dyak's\r\neye.\r\n\r\nWith a shriek of pain the fellow lurched galvanically, to stab with\r\ndemoniacal might.  But the blow went wide, in his agony, and when\r\nGrenville had caught the wrist in a grip that a serpent could scarcely\r\nhave broken, he instantly laid hold of it with his second hand, with a\r\nmotion incredibly swift.  Then turning his back with the skinny brown\r\narm across his shoulder, and abruptly stooping forward, Sidney hoisted\r\nthe scoundrel free from the rocks, on his shoulders, and, moving\r\nquickly towards the cliff, ended the fight then and there.\r\n\r\nHe broke the arm thus used as a leverage against the Dyak's weight, and\r\nliterally slammed the shuddering creature down on the rocks, at the\r\nbrink of the wall, where he poised but a moment over death.\r\n\r\nIf he tried to writhe backward to the solid ledge, the effort was\r\nbelated.  With a piercing scream he toppled over, flinging out his\r\nbroken arm in a gesture grotesque and disordered.  Then he suddenly\r\ngrayed, in the limbo of smoke, and shot swiftly downward to his doom.\r\n\r\nGrenville still bit upon the branch that glowed with fire.  He searched\r\nabout pantingly, found his end of fuse, and saw the powder sputter with\r\nignition.  He had barely stepped back when, from over at the trail,\r\ncame a sudden and tremendous detonation.\r\n\r\nThat the Dyaks were there on the terrace, after all, destroying his\r\nbombs, was the one thought that flashed through the smoke in his brain,\r\nas his own sharp explosion shook the air and hollowed huge masses from\r\nthe cliff.\r\n\r\nHe stumbled and groped laboriously across the uneven heaps of stone to\r\nreach the secret passage, where Elaine must be crouching in fear.  In\r\nhis ears rang her words \"If it has to come, let's receive it here\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\nAlready he feared her one grim wish had been brutally denied her in\r\nthis hideous pall of smoke.  He saw a figure, dimly, through the reek,\r\nand crouched to take revenge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nTHE LAST CUP OF WATER\r\n\r\nThe figure was Elaine's.  Grenville was almost upon her, prepared for\r\nsome swift and terrible deed of retaliation, when a swirl in the shroud\r\nthat enveloped them both revealed her standing near the edge.\r\n\r\nShe still held a glowing fire-stick in her hand, as she peered through\r\nthe billowing cloud of smoke where she had flung an ignited bomb.  She\r\nhad fled from her shelter, in desperate dread, lest a murderous fate\r\novertake her companion, battling alone with the fiends.  She had found\r\nhis post deserted, and, having discerned two figures on the trail, had\r\ninstantly obeyed an impulse to protect the hill with the only means\r\nprovided.\r\n\r\nShe uttered a cry as she saw Grenville crouching behind her, raising\r\nher brand like a weapon, then sinking in relief.\r\n\r\n\"You!\" he said.  \"Elaine!  I might have known!\"\r\n\r\n\"I am sure they are coming up behind us there!\" she answered.  \"I know\r\nI heard the bamboo buckets jangling!  Have you been across to see?\"\r\n\r\n\"I fired the bomb,\" he answered.  \"Didn't you know?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head.  Her ears, that had been so finely attuned to catch\r\nthe warning from the rearward cliff, had received or recorded no\r\nimpression whatsoever of the huger disturbance, while her own bomb's\r\ncolossal thunder and shock engrossed her eager attention.\r\n\r\n\"Was anyone there?\" she asked, half choking with the reek.  \"I suppose\r\nyou couldn't see.\"\r\n\r\n\"I saw no one when lighting the fuse,\" he answered.  \"What was\r\nhappening here?\"\r\n\r\nShe related what she had seen and what she had done.\r\n\r\n\"I hope I killed them!\" she added, weak and dizzy from the smoke.  \"But\r\nthey probably ran away!\"\r\n\r\nIt was the first time she had entertained such a feeling.\r\n\r\nHe urged her again to the shelter, where he coaxed her to drink, and\r\nbathe her face, for the freshening and soothing influence of which she\r\nwas sadly in need.  Returning, then, to the shelter for some of their\r\nfruit, he groped his way down along the trail--and found that one or\r\nthe other of the bombs had so shattered the ledge, as to render it\r\nuseless for passing till the gap could in some way be bridged.\r\n\r\nThey were safe from invasion in the night--but they were, likewise,\r\nmarooned on the hill!  It was hardly likely the Dyaks would attempt to\r\nconstruct a platform across the yawning cavity, under the shadow of the\r\ngun, while, as for themselves, descent at present was entirely out of\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\nMeantime the smoke was unabated, if it was not, indeed, more dense and\r\nchoking than before.  All the man's characteristic doggedness of\r\npurpose was required in preparations for the night.  The sun was down;\r\nthe brief and usually comforting twilight seemed entirely absent, as\r\ndarkness was hastened by the fumes.\r\n\r\nBack and forth from the now deserted shelter to the passage Sidney\r\ngroped time after time, fetching her couch and robe for Elaine, and\r\ntheir meager supplies for dinner.  The gallery then became her boudoir,\r\nsanctified to her uses.  Outside on the ledge, where at least a breath\r\nof air trailed upward from the cave beneath, to escape at the door and\r\na little dilute the stifling smoke, he finally made his sentinel post\r\nto pass the long session of darkness.\r\n\r\nHe was roused repeatedly in the night by the sheer discomfort of his\r\nresting-place, and the smoke that smarted his nostrils.  All the long\r\nhours through the dull red flames glowed fitfully, down through the\r\njungle.  He was tempted, times without number, to throw out his\r\nplatform to the tree and descend with a bomb, to hurl at some group of\r\nthe demons, there in the nether gloom of the Hades they created.  He\r\ncurbed his impatience rigidly, however, and crowded the impulse back.\r\nThat one or two natives at the most maintained the fires was a\r\nsupposition not to be ignored.  The possible results of such an\r\nenterprise were incommensurate with the risk that must be incurred.\r\n\r\nDespite his uneasiness of mind and body he slept for a time between\r\nmidnight and dawn as the mere result of overstrain and the weariness\r\naccumulated for several days.\r\n\r\nFor a brief time after sunrise the northerly breeze abated, permitting\r\nthe smoke to ascend more nearly straight.  The headland was thereby\r\nfreed and sweetened, only, however, to be re-enveloped later, and,\r\nveiled from the other features of the island.\r\n\r\nGrenville took advantage of the respite to make an examination of the\r\ncliff at the rear of the camp.  It had been so shattered, where the\r\nbomb shook down the disintegrated tufa, that its ascent would never\r\nagain be attempted.  The framework of bamboo cups was gone.  There was\r\nnothing below to indicate whether or not a Dyak boat might have been\r\nswamped by falling rock.\r\n\r\nThe cavity torn in the regular trail was rather more exaggerated than\r\ndiminished by the morning's revelations.  Grenville was certain the\r\nenemy would hardly hazard bridging the gap while they thought a single\r\nounce of punishment remained upon the terrace.  He was not altogether\r\ncertain he should not construct a bridge himself, since only when they\r\ncharged upon his position could he hope to decimate the blood-desiring\r\nsavages, who must still remain in menacing numbers on the island.\r\n\r\nThe little brass cannon was once more charged, though its use was\r\nhardly likely.  The wind and the smoke resumed their steady flow across\r\nand about the hill before Elaine appeared.\r\n\r\nShe was pale and plainly weary, when at length she emerged from the\r\npassage.  Her sleep had been broken, and haunted by dreams of countless\r\nnew atrocities committed by the demons below.  Her courage was\r\nphenomenal.  She made no complaint, but attempted a smile and a cheery\r\noutlook on the day.\r\n\r\nGrenville was wrung, more than comforted, at the wistful effort she was\r\nmaking to sustain her slender hope and encourage his own flagging\r\nspirit.  When he found that hardly a pint of water remained in the jugs\r\nhe had thought would supply them at least for a couple of days, his\r\ndespair for Elaine became intensely acute, and his heart began dully to\r\nache.  Two of the clay receptacles had developed tiny cracks, perhaps\r\nfrom the jarring of explosions, while a third had toppled over and\r\nspilled its precious contents after having been placed in the passage.\r\nPercolation and usage had drained the others inevitably--and the day\r\nwas beginning with heat and stifling reek.\r\n\r\nMuch of the fruit that Sidney had gathered was now unfit for use, and\r\nwas, therefore, thrown away.  By way of conserving the water supply,\r\nthey made a breakfast of paw-paws and bananas only, though the meat\r\nremaining from the previous day was still acceptable.\r\n\r\nGrenville descended to the cavern as soon as this scant and oversweet\r\nmeal was concluded.  He bore two jugs, to be filled from the basins in\r\nthe rock.  When the light from the blazing torch he held above his head\r\ndimly outlined but one of the pools he had seen on a former occasion,\r\nhe realized that some insignificant fissure must have resulted from his\r\nblast, and permitted the other pools to trickle to the sea.\r\n\r\nHe filled his jugs with the utmost care, scooping up the water at the\r\ndeepest hole to leave all unclean sediment undisturbed.  That the pool\r\nmust soon succumb to evaporation was obvious.  Vaguely he wondered\r\nwhich might last the longer, this underground well, or the breath in\r\nhis body and Elaine's.\r\n\r\nEven the sight and touch of the precious water excited his mouth to\r\nthirst.  With the jugs both full and set carefully aside, he sprawled\r\nout eagerly, flat on the rocks, for a deep and satisfying draught.\r\n\r\nHardly had the water reached his palate, however, when he lifted his\r\nhead with a sound like a stifled groan.  The pool was connected with\r\nthe tides--_the liquid there was brine_!\r\n\r\nHe rose to his knees, with his fist before his eyes, his whole body\r\ntense and rigid with his soul's recoil from the visions abruptly\r\nshadowed in his mind.  The cordon about the helpless girl was so\r\nhideously complete!  It seemed like the bitterness of her doom that he\r\ntasted on his tongue.\r\n\r\nIt appeared so useless now to struggle.  How he should take this latest\r\nnews to the uncomplaining comrade of his destiny was more than he could\r\ndetermine.  Wild thoughts of offering all the treasure he had found, as\r\nransom for Elaine at least, possessed his mind, as he conjured up the\r\nfinal, triumphant approach of the Dyaks, whom the two famished keepers\r\nof the terrace would at length be no longer able successfully to resist.\r\n\r\nHe likewise thought of offering himself, could Elaine be finally\r\nspared.  But through it all he was sickeningly conscious that neither\r\ncourse could avail with these treacherous fiends.  A human head was\r\nmore to them than treasures of earth or heaven.  Moreover, the\r\nmurderous savages had already paid a heavy toll, and would smart in\r\ntheir blood for revenge.\r\n\r\nThere could be no bargain made with such an enemy, all but victorious\r\nalready, and certain of final success.  They should never find that\r\ntreasure, however, Grenville swore, if he had to sink it in the sea!\r\nAnd as for a final triumph--there were many ways, in a last extremity,\r\nwhereby at least the unspeakable horrors, certain to follow their\r\ncapture alive, could be escaped by both himself and Elaine.\r\n\r\nWild rage possessed him, kneeling there, as he thought of the merciless\r\nhead-hunters smoking them out on the hill, and waiting as loathsomely\r\nas vultures for the slowly approaching end.  Mad plans for sinking\r\ntheir anchored boats, for loading himself with torch and bombs, to\r\ncharge like a Nemesis through their ranks, or for luring them up to\r\nsome deadly mine, ranged erratically through his brain.\r\n\r\nHe thought of attempting a condensation of sea water to provide Elaine\r\nwith drink.  He was swiftly possessed by a plan, even more absurd, of\r\nmaking a float with his bamboo stems, and sailing away with Elaine on\r\nboard, under cover of the darkness.\r\n\r\nHe arose at last, dizzy, with the vortex of impractical suggestions\r\nrevolving in his mind.  He emptied his jugs and strode to the mouth of\r\nthe cavern, looking out on smoke and sea.  The tide was low.  Whole\r\ncolonies of mussels clung there below him on the rocks.  They were\r\nfood!  The thought came home to him swiftly--only to be immediately\r\nsucceeded by the realization they were salt, and would make for greater\r\nthirst.  He thought of the wail that had formerly haunted the island--a\r\nfriendly, invaluable phenomenon that had not been repeated for days.\r\nHe thought of the raft he had rowed with such ease when he came here to\r\nblow out the ledge.  Was it floating still in the estuary's mouth, or\r\nhad some of the Dyaks destroyed it?\r\n\r\nThe estuary!--could he only reach its tepid pool, creep towards its\r\nsource, fill one of his jugs, and return to gladden Elaine!  His busy\r\nmind was instantly working on the various steps by which he might\r\nsucceed in lashing together some sort of raft, for a night excursion to\r\nthe tiny rill that fed the vine-surrounded inlet where the water was\r\nnot brine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nA BREATHLESS MARGIN\r\n\r\nGrenville returned for his jugs and the torch, impatient to be\r\nemployed.  The clay receptacles were useless on the hill, but he\r\ncarried them back to the gallery, to leave them on the floor.  The\r\nlower rock-and-wattle barrier he carefully readjusted to its place, and\r\nsecured with the bar of wood.\r\n\r\n\"The water below is rather poor,\" he informed Elaine, when he once more\r\nrejoined her above.  \"I believe I can reach a supply considerably\r\nbetter by building a bamboo platform that will give me access to a\r\nlarger and fresher pool.\"\r\n\r\n Elaine was thinking of another, more personal danger.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think these creatures have visited the cave?\"\r\n\r\n\"If they have, they left no signs.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are not afraid they may go there soon--and discover the end of\r\nthis passage?\"\r\n\r\nGrenville shook his head.  \"I only wish they would try--every man Jack\r\nof them hunting there at once!  If it weren't for this smoke, I should\r\ntry to lure them in!\"\r\n\r\nGlad of an occupation, no matter how forlorn the hope it afforded, he\r\nwent promptly to work fetching all of the largest bamboo stems from his\r\ngenerous supply, together with wood for fuel and many lengths of\r\ncreeper.  By the time these various transfers were complete, he had\r\nleft but little of their meager possessions in or about the former camp.\r\n\r\nBombs, fuses, torch-wood, and much of his extra powder he now proceeded\r\nto store along the wall, and in a niche of the gallery, where they\r\nshould neither obstruct the passage under foot, nor yet be exposed to\r\npossible accident from necessary fire.  The terrace continued to be\r\nwrapped in smoke, as on the previous day.  Instructing Elaine to call\r\nhim instantly, should any attempt be made by the Dyaks to bridge the\r\ngap on the trail, he now began the laborious task of carrying one after\r\nanother of the bamboo stems down the passage to the cave.\r\n\r\nThe stems were large, some of them fully six inches through at the\r\nbutt, and while they were never heavy, yet the twelve or more feet of\r\nlength to which he had reduced them made their transfer through the\r\nnarrow and angular gallery an awkward and troublesome maneuver, with\r\nonly a torch for light.\r\n\r\nHe had made up his mind that six of these stems, lashed together in\r\npairs, or even laid side by side, and slightly separated, would\r\ncomplete a float on which he could readily find sufficient buoyancy for\r\nhimself and a couple of water jugs, more especially as he thoroughly\r\nintended to stretch himself out flat, full length, upon it while moving\r\nabout the shore.  He felt, moreover, it must be so light he could not\r\nonly launch it from the cave, but even withdraw it inside again, should\r\ndanger so require.\r\n\r\nFortunately, he reflected, none of the stems was split.  Each comprised\r\na set of water-tight compartments that a load of double his avoirdupois\r\ncould hardly sink beneath the surface.  If he found that four of the\r\nlengths would answer as well as six, he would certainly use no more.\r\n\r\nAs he stumbled and edged his way downward once again, with the last of\r\nhis load colliding here and there along the wall, he thought, perhaps,\r\nit might be possible to test the float in the salty pool that remained\r\nin the basin of the cavern.  Could this be done, much time would be\r\nsaved, and no risk of being discovered at his work need be incurred.\r\n\r\nFor his greater convenience in assembling materials and tools, he\r\nplaced both his torch and final burden for a moment within the passage,\r\nwhen he came once more to the cave.  Three of the bamboo stems were\r\nthen in the cavern proper, while all of the creeper and the other\r\nessentials remained on the gallery floor.  He paused to wipe his brow,\r\nfor he was sweating.  His mouth was dry with a growing thirst that\r\nrefused to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nHe had barely stepped out to survey the space for the likeliest site\r\nconvenient to his needs, when, abruptly, a human voice sent a murmurous\r\necho through the hollow tomb.  A sharp command immediately\r\nfollowed--all in some barbaric tongue.  But before the noise of\r\nsomething dully scraping on the outside ledge could add its\r\nconfirmation to the somewhat belated alarm, Grenville was certain that\r\na Dyak boat had come to the cavern, and its crew were about to land.\r\n\r\nInstantly pouncing upon the nearest length of his precious bamboo, he\r\ndarted with it to the passage.  The second stem struck on the inner\r\nwall, not only delaying his movements, but sounding a thud that he felt\r\nmust be heard through all the vast bulk of the hill.\r\n\r\nYet he dared not either betray the fact he had been in the cave, or\r\nlose that final pole.  Once more, as he heard the Dyaks coming, and\r\neven beheld a shadow, preceding its owner to the place, he darted\r\nsilently out at his door to lay hold of the last remaining stem.\r\n\r\nHe was certain its end must be plainly seen, as the Dyaks now rose\r\nabove the ledge.  A sound that he made seemed incredibly loud--and his\r\ndoor was out where the boatmen's torch must play a red light upon it!\r\n\r\nHe stumbled across his materials, now congesting his narrow space.  He\r\nthrust out an arm, laid hold of his door, and had barely drawn it\r\nacross the opening when the glare of the torch the Dyaks held sent red\r\nrays in upon him.\r\n\r\nNot another move could he make without betraying his presence near at\r\nhand.  To adjust the barrier solidly in place might readily prove\r\nfatal.  To leave it loose, a palpable sham where all should appear as\r\nsolid wall, was scarcely less of a risk.\r\n\r\nHolding it firmly, lest it slip, and peering breathlessly out through\r\nthe chink which it failed by an inch to cover, Grenville beheld three\r\nhalf-naked forms, incredibly magnified and diabolized not only by the\r\ntorch they held, but also by the shadows they cast upon the rocks, and\r\nthe general aspect of the region, black as Inferno.  Three thinner,\r\nmore furtive fiends of the nether abyss would have been hard, indeed,\r\nto imagine.  In the tallest Sidney recognized the chief.\r\n\r\nAs they turned about to scan the wall, and the breach he had made with\r\nhis explosion, the whites of their eyes and the gleam of their teeth\r\nrendered all of their faces strangely hideous, with the yellowish glare\r\nprojecting them indistinctly against the ebon of the tomb.\r\n\r\nThat their keen, malicious eyes must instantly discover the wall's\r\ndecided imperfection, where the gallery door was askew, seemed to\r\nGrenville inescapable.  They motioned towards him, and down at the\r\nfloor, in manifest wonder that the place was no longer filled with\r\nwater.  Their voices were low.  They spoke as if with a certain awe in\r\nwhich the place was held.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Grenville they would never go about their business.  His\r\nmuscles ached with the unaccustomed strain put upon them to support the\r\nheavy door.  How long he could stand there, making no sound, and\r\npermitting no movement of the barrier, was a question he could not\r\nanswer.  If only his cleaver had not been dropped around the bend,\r\nbeside his torch, he would almost have dared spring out on the\r\nunsuspecting Dyaks to brain them where they stood!\r\n\r\nAt thought of his torch, redly glowing, in beyond, he sweated anew,\r\nconvinced that as soon as the boatmen grew accustomed to the darkness\r\nof the cavern, these torch rays must impinge upon their vision, and\r\ninstantly divulge the secret of the passage to the top.\r\n\r\nOne of the Dyaks now approached even closer than before.  Savagely\r\ndetermined he would slay the man, should he raise a hand, or otherwise\r\ngive the slightest intimation that the door was seen at last, Sidney\r\ngrew hot in his farthest pulse, and became as tense as a tight-coiled\r\nspring as he steadied to leap from the place.\r\n\r\nBut the man in command now grumbled another of his orders.  The fellow\r\nso near discovery and death turned slowly about, made one more gesture\r\ntowards the shattered ledge, and followed the other where they made\r\ntheir way across the uneven floor.\r\n\r\nUntil they had passed to a second ridge, where their feet disturbed a\r\nfew loose fragments that rattled down towards the base, Grenville made\r\nnot the slightest move to alter his position.  Then cautiously, without\r\na sound, he adjusted the door to its proper place and secured it with\r\nthe bar.\r\n\r\nHe still had a chink through which to peer, but he first moved back to\r\nhis blazing torch and smothered its light on the rocks.  When he once\r\nmore groped his way to the tiny opening, the Dyaks had come to the\r\nrifled chamber.  He could hear their exclamations of disgust and anger,\r\nbut only their torch could be seen.\r\n\r\nAware they might still return to his wall and discover the one\r\nremaining retreat where Elaine was even remotely secure, Grenville was\r\nseized with an irresistible impulse to destroy the fiends on the\r\ninstant, if such a denouement could be rendered possible.\r\n\r\nHe turned about to grope his way upward and secure a bomb as swiftly as\r\nthe darkness would permit.  Over the basket of treasure, some time\r\nsince deposited there by the wall, he blundered, and fell to his knees.\r\nThe thing was in the way.  He took it up impatiently and carried it\r\nwell up the passage to one of the broadest galleries, where he placed\r\nit again on the floor.\r\n\r\nWith one of the smallest of his bombs, and carrying one of his\r\nfirebrands only for a torch, he once more descended, feeling his way\r\nalong the wall, eager to regain the lower entrance, lest it might be\r\nalready discovered.  He had been delayed in securing the brand, without\r\nwhich his bomb was useless.  He had told Elaine his measures were only\r\nof defense.\r\n\r\nThey were hardly even that.  When he came to the door he could see no\r\ntorch, for the Dyaks had gone, in new exasperation, and their voices\r\nechoed back from the ledge.  The impulse to rush out thus belatedly,\r\nignite his fuse, and hurl his engine of destruction upon them, or their\r\nboat, was one he curbed with difficulty, at the dictates of sober\r\nsense.  For a dozen reasons the maneuver might fail to destroy the\r\nmurderous trio.  And should one escape to advertise the fact he was\r\nsomehow concealed in the cavern, no possible cleverness could avail to\r\nprotect Elaine or himself.\r\n\r\nShould a larger number come to the cave----  But he knew it was hardly\r\nlikely, now, that even a few would return.  If the Dyaks had, as he\r\nfelt convinced, concluded that the open niche meant that the tomb had\r\nbeen pillaged, that the treasure was gone, either taken by himself or\r\nanother, they would have no conceivable reason left for courting\r\ndisaster here again.  For unless they should dare approach the place by\r\nnight, it was only under cover of the rolling smoke they would risk\r\nattack from above.\r\n\r\nHe even thought of hastening back to the terrace now to drop a bomb\r\nupon them.  It was only a recollection of the all-engulfing smoke that\r\nhalted this intent.  Instead he dislodged the wooden bar, removed the\r\ndoor to his secret gallery, and crept out to glide to the breach in the\r\nledge for a possible view of the boatmen.\r\n\r\nOnly the disappearing end of their craft was shown through the fumes\r\nthat veiled the tide.  It was Grenville's useful catamaran, as he\r\ninstantly discerned.  A new resentment burned in his blood, but left\r\nhim as helpless as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nGRENVILLE'S DESPERATE CHANCE\r\n\r\nAt noon Elaine reluctantly consumed the last remaining drop of water.\r\nGrenville had taken a sip, and pretended to take a swallow.  To refuse\r\nit longer, Elaine quite clearly comprehended, would be but to see it\r\nooze away through the jar, to be drunk by the merciless heat.\r\n\r\n\"I shall get a new supply,\" said Sidney, attempting an accent of cheer,\r\n\"but I'd rather avoid using that of the cavern, for fear it may not be\r\nwholesome.\"\r\n\r\nElaine, in her way of divining the truth, was only partially deceived.\r\nShe felt that the water below in the cave was wholly unfit for\r\nconsumption.  She knew that if anything even remotely possible could be\r\ndone to refill their vessels, Sidney would have filled them long before.\r\n\r\nShe made no discouraging comments, however, despite the fact her hope\r\nwas succumbing to despair.  The smoke continued to roll in sullen\r\nclouds across and about the terrace; the sun beat down through it\r\nredly, soaking the rock in caloric, that sank to the gallery itself.\r\n\r\nThe noonday meal had been slight and unrefreshing--a bit of fruit, too\r\nwarm and too ripe for relish on the palate, and a few odd scraps of the\r\nmeat.  It was water that both insistently craved, and for which they\r\ngrew fevered and distressed.\r\n\r\nThe smoldering brands in the furnace of rocks could not be permitted to\r\ndie away in ash.  Elaine had undertaken the maintenance of this, their\r\naltar spark, which rarely rose to a flame.  She was safe enough to come\r\nand go from the passage entrance to the nearby furnace Grenville had\r\nmoved to facilitate her duties, but the smoke seemed far more stifling\r\nand hot than it had the previous day, while, with headache, thirst, and\r\na heaviness in all her weary being, the endlessly cheerful and\r\ncourageous little companion of Grenville's maddening ordeal felt ready\r\nto drop and rise no more.\r\n\r\nAgain at his task of constructing a float that should bear him from the\r\ncavern to the inlet formed by the spring, Sidney toiled with no mercy\r\nto himself in the workshop far down in the rocks.  He felt at times he\r\nmust gulp down even the water of the sea, so parched was his throat,\r\nand so craving was his system.\r\n\r\nAt five o'clock his bamboo raft was completed, even with braces for his\r\njugs.  It had also been tried in the basin of the cave, and made\r\nfinally ready for launching.  But the tide would be low till eight.\r\nHis blast had made the water more approachable than formerly, yet to\r\nfight his way against a powerful current would over-tax his strength.\r\nIn any event he must wait for the darkness of night.\r\n\r\nHe returned to Elaine, and although he, too, was weary to the bone, her\r\npatient endurance of suspense and suffering aroused him to a state of\r\nanguish in which no exhausting task would have seemed too great for him\r\nto undertake.  He was wrung by her wistful attempt at a smile.\r\n\r\n\"The day is nearly done,\" she said.  \"The night is sure to be cooler.\"\r\n\r\nIt was considerably cooler, but scarcely more fresh, since the smoke\r\nappeared to pour in even vaster volumes from the greenery below.  That\r\nthe Dyaks were keeping strict watch on the water supply there could be\r\nno reason to doubt.  From time to time a weird bit of chanting arose\r\nfrom that fume-creating garden that had once been so fair as to win\r\nfrom Elaine the prettiest name she knew.\r\n\r\nGrenville felt certain, in fact, the boatmen's camp had been made about\r\nthe inlet or the spring.  The short stretch of beach where he and\r\nElaine had landed, and where he had later made a bower of the trees,\r\nwould be certain to attract these half-amphibious savages, though their\r\nboats were moored behind the opposite hill.\r\n\r\nFor a time he wondered if he might not be more wise to pass entirely\r\naround the island, to approach the pool of fresh water from below.  But\r\nreflecting that various currents of the tide would buffet and beset\r\nhim, in addition to which he must run the gauntlet past the Dyak boats,\r\nhe surrendered the suggestion without delay, and impatiently awaited\r\nthe tide.\r\n\r\nThree times he went down the passage, torch in hand, to examine the\r\nstages of the water.  At length he bethought him of two short\r\nscoop-like paddles, to assist in propelling his craft, and feverishly\r\nset about their construction.\r\n\r\nThey were done in less than half an hour, since they consisted merely\r\nof two half-sections of bamboo cylinder, lashed to a pair of handles.\r\n\r\nElaine was aware he was making ready for more than an ordinary\r\nadventure, as she watched him with her wide and lustrous eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps relief may come to-morrow,\" she finally observed.  \"You are\r\nquite exhausted.  Might you not be wiser to rest to-night?  We can get\r\nalong, I am sure.\"\r\n\r\nBut even her voice made a rasp in her throat, so distressed was her\r\nsystem for water.\r\n\r\n\"I need a bit of change,\" he said.  \"It is certain to do me good.\"\r\n\r\nWith a touch of his former brusqueness, he presently bade her seek her\r\ncouch, during the time he expected to be gone, and vanished once more\r\ndown the dark, steep passageway, with his paddles and torch in hand.\r\n\r\nThe torch was left in the gallery, extinguished.  The concealing door\r\nwas adjusted to its place.  These were mere precautions against the\r\ncave's discovery, yet Grenville was certain no Dyaks would approach the\r\nplace that night.  His two best jugs were placed on the ledge; his\r\ncleaver was hung at his belt.  He could take no bombs or lighted brands\r\non such an expedition.\r\n\r\nThe task of launching his raft on the tide involved unexpected labor.\r\nIts lightness made it an easy prey to the swirl that always filled the\r\ncavern's walled approach.  It was sucked once nearly under, its farther\r\nend disappearing entirely from view--and Granville withdrew it,\r\ndesperately glad the jugs had not been placed upon it.\r\n\r\nAwaiting a quieter mood of the whirlpool, half seen in the darkness, he\r\nlaunched the float again, and beheld it rest there, quietly, nosing\r\nagainst the ledge.  He turned for the jugs, but, casting a quick glance\r\nbackward, at the slightest of scraping sounds, saw the raft swinging\r\noutward from his reach.\r\n\r\nHis arm was too short for its recovery.  Leaping wildly out in the\r\nwater, he caught it again, and was washed against the jagged wall\r\nbefore he once more returned it to the landing.  He was soaked to the\r\nskin, but his pulses throbbed with heat and dogged energy that would\r\nthink of no defeat.\r\n\r\nWith his jugs finally laid flat between the bamboo supporters, front\r\nand rear, and with paddles in hand, as he lay at full length on the\r\nlight but half-submerged platform, he rowed the raft out with a motion\r\nas if he were swimming.\r\n\r\nIndeed, like a giant oar-bug, more or less helplessly carried by the\r\ncurrent that it rides, he spun slowly about in the maelstrom of the\r\ngathering tide before he could escape past the portal and head for the\r\ninlet below.\r\n\r\nHe soon discovered that to continue far in this fatiguing attitude\r\nwould abominably strain his neck, if not his entire body.  Not without\r\nconsiderable difficulty, in balancing the craft, he effected a change\r\nof position, and knelt upon the supports.\r\n\r\nThe waves washed up about his knees and feet, but of this he was\r\npractically oblivious.  Assisted now by the current, and with eyes\r\nintent on the darkened shore, beyond the uprise of the cliff, he\r\npropelled himself much farther out than formerly, with the purpose of\r\navoiding the possible vigilance of Dyaks on the beach.\r\n\r\nThe night was not exceedingly dark, so brilliant was the light from the\r\nstars.  Once the region of smoke was left behind, the blurred and\r\nblended features of the island were sufficiently well revealed for his\r\npurposes, since he knew its every silhouette as well as the contours of\r\nthe coast.\r\n\r\nHe had rowed and drifted, perhaps, half the distance essential to land\r\nat the estuary mouth, when the sound of voices, floated out from the\r\nshore, abruptly halted his movements.  The Dyaks were there.  Either\r\nmotion or any unusual disturbance would suffice to betray his presence\r\noff the land.\r\n\r\nAnd now, as if every fate had become malignant, the current drifted him\r\ninward, where he knew he should keep well away.  At the risk of\r\nexciting curiosity, if nothing more, he dipped his paddles, with a slow\r\nand silent expenditure of strength, and swept the float powerfully\r\noutward again, till the shore seemed a part with the sea.\r\n\r\nFor a time that seemed interminable he hung about that outer stretch,\r\nawaiting a further sound of the voices.  They did not come.  Once more\r\nat last he paddled silently inward, finally worming, as before, to a\r\nprostrate position on the raft.  The chant of the head-hunters came\r\nagain, as if from the depths of the jungle.\r\n\r\n\"Now, if ever!\" muttered Grenville, half aloud, and impelled by a new\r\nand reckless desperation, increased by his thirst and his impotent rage\r\nat the creatures still feeding the fumes that Elaine could not avoid,\r\nhe sent his craft swiftly landward, thankful, at least, for the mild\r\ndisturbance of breaking ripples on the shore that would drown what\r\nslight noises he might make.\r\n\r\nTempted to moor his float outside the estuary, he readily agreed it\r\nmight thereby lead to his discovery, and must, as a matter of fact, be\r\ncompletely concealed in the shadows of the pool.  Excited now by the\r\npossibility that his catamaran, with the oars and rowlocks, might still\r\nremain in its former harbor, he was doomed to prompt disappointment on\r\ngaining the estuary basin.  There was nothing whatsoever in the place.\r\n\r\nHis jugs and paddles he had placed upon the sand.  It was only the work\r\nof a moment to draw his float across the bar and gently thrust it away\r\nfrom sight beneath the overhanging verdure.  Then he stood there,\r\nknee-deep in the water, straining his ears for the slightest sound of\r\nthe Dyaks stirring in the thicket.\r\n\r\nOnly the drone of a halting voice was wafted to the place.  In silence\r\nhe concealed his paddles, and took up his jugs, to wade with the utmost\r\ncaution up the pool, towards the spring that formed its source.  The\r\nwater about him was brackish, from its mixture with the tide.\r\n\r\nDeeper and deeper grew the basin.  The water had risen to his waist.\r\nHe sank in steadily with every step, despairing now with the sickening\r\nthought he might be compelled to swim.  Such a task, with two filled\r\njugs, would be impossible, as he bitterly realized.  But on he went, as\r\nnoiselessly as before.\r\n\r\nThe water was now about his breast, and he held his jugs above it.\r\nSomething gently nosed against him--and gave him a start.  Thoughts of\r\nthe tropic serpents so frequently inhabiting the water, chilled a thin\r\nchannel down his spine.  Then he saw that the thing which might have\r\nbeen a reptile head was the cork and neck of a bottle.  He dipped down\r\nand caught it between his teeth, more gratified in all his being than\r\nif it had been a thing of gold.\r\n\r\nIt almost seemed to the man like a sign that the tide of ill-fortune\r\nhad turned--the tide of luck.  He had certainly passed the deepest\r\nsection of the estuary; he was rising on higher ground.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the soundings of dripping water, ready to fall from his\r\nclothing, he proceeded more slowly than before.  When at length he came\r\nto a strip of barren sand, he rested his jugs, withdrew the cork from\r\nhis bottle, and was gratified to detect the odor of stale beer, or\r\nstout, which the thing had formerly contained.  He rinsed it then and\r\nthere, to make it sweet, and crowded it into his pocket.\r\n\r\nWhen he once more took up his jugs, to resume his quest of drinkable\r\nfluid, he was presently confronted by an exceptional tangle of the\r\nshrubbery, arching the tortuous windings of the estuary's head.  Here\r\nhe found himself obliged to pause and noiselessly bend back or break a\r\nnumber of the slender branches before he could wade as before.\r\n\r\nHe started some small nocturnal animal out through the growth, and the\r\nrustling disturbance made by the beast was heard by the Dyaks beyond.\r\nOne of them called out sharply.  To Grenville's complete astonishment\r\nand dismay another man, barely a few yards off, replied with a species\r\nof grunt.  The fellow had come there, either to visit or to set a\r\nsnare, and must have believed he had frightened the animal himself.\r\n\r\nSidney could hear him working now, as he leaned a bit closer to the\r\nfoliage, incapable of moving further while the hunter delayed in the\r\nthicket.  The fellow presently arose, as if to go.  Instead, however,\r\nhe approached even closer to Grenville's place of concealment, and\r\nSidney oozed cold perspiration, helplessly occupied, as he was, with a\r\njug in either hand, and his cleaver still swung at his waist.\r\n\r\nTo have moved, or attempted to place either jug in the water at his\r\nfeet, must have been fatal to his mission.  Yet he felt convinced the\r\nDyak must fairly run against him, unless he could move to the side.\r\nOne of his shoes, moreover, was sinking deeply in slimy mire.\r\n\r\nThat his balance must be overcome seemed well-nigh inevitable.  A\r\nbranch from one of the larger trees that grew above him on the bank now\r\nswept so forcibly against the other foliage as the Dyak hauled it\r\ndownward, to sever a twig for his trap, that Grenville's face was\r\nlightly brushed.  When the limb sprang upward a moment later, he pulled\r\nhis foot from the hole.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to the man a quarter of an hour at least that the trapper\r\nremained there, a few feet away, making one more sound, from time to\r\ntime, when it seemed at last he must have departed.  When he finally\r\nwent, there could be no assurance he would not return again.\r\nNotwithstanding this possibility, Grenville slipped furtively along\r\nonce more, disturbed to find how far towards the spring this narrowing,\r\nsea-level neck of the inlet continued through the growth.\r\n\r\nWhen he came at length to a rise of the island, down which the trickle\r\nfrom the spring had made its course, he found himself at the edge of a\r\nsmall, grass-grown clearing, that could hardly be more than a stone's\r\ntoss away from the Dyaks' temporary camp.  A small, deep basin, filled\r\nwith the precious water he sought, reflected a star at the zenith of\r\nthe heavens.  It some way gave him hope.  Of courage he had no lack.\r\n\r\nNoiselessly, but without hesitation, he crept forward to the place and\r\nbent to drink, then to fill his bottle and jugs.  At a snap that came\r\nfrom the shadows beyond he looked up alertly, beholding through the\r\nleaves a bright bit of fire upon the earth, with two of the Dyaks at\r\nits side.  Every accent of their halting conversation came clearly to\r\nhis ears.\r\n\r\nWith his three receptacles filled at last, he began his retreat from\r\nthe place.  He had barely vanished from the clearing, and come to the\r\ncover of the growth once more, when the man who was laying the snare in\r\nsome pathway of the small jungle animals came back to complete his work.\r\n\r\nGrenville thought his arms must relinquish the holds in their sockets\r\nbefore the unsuspecting hunter was content to leave the neighborhood.\r\nThe jugs, so long and silently held, were rested a moment on the bank,\r\nwhen, at last, the moment did arrive when Sidney could dare retreat.\r\nThen down through the stubborn tangle, once more, he moved like a\r\nsilent shade.  With every yard thus placed between himself and the\r\nnatives by the spring, the hope in his breast increased.\r\n\r\nHe came once more to the deeper estuary pool and, lifting his jugs to\r\nhis shoulders, waded cautiously forward, nearly up to his throat in the\r\ntepid brine that smelled too rank for anything but swamp.  He paused by\r\nhis raft, for a moment undecided as to whether he should place his jugs\r\nin the braces lashed upon it, before he pushed it past the bar, or\r\nafter it should float on the tides.\r\n\r\nWhile he stood there, with a sense of exultation daring to warm in his\r\nsoul--an exultation centered on Elaine and the joy it must presently be\r\nto see her thirst allayed--he suddenly stiffened at the sound of Dyak\r\nvoices, alarmingly near at hand.\r\n\r\nRetreating instantly, under the shadow of the foliage and against the\r\nend of his raft, he placed one jug upon it, noiselessly, and put out\r\nhis hand to grasp at a branch to draw himself further from sight.\r\n\r\nBut the branch on which he laid his grip was suddenly alive.  It\r\nwrithed and lashed sharply at his knuckles until, with a shudder of\r\ncomprehension that he had clutched the tail of a snake, he flung it off\r\nand knew it had glided away.\r\n\r\nHe had no choice but to try again, and this time met with better\r\nfortune.  Out through the foliage, arranged thus hurriedly about him,\r\nhe peered towards the low bit of beach.  There was no one in sight, but\r\nbeyond, on the sea, suddenly looming before him, and coming about to\r\nface the protected inlet, a third of the Dyak sailing-boats, a new\r\narrival, manned by an additional group of head-hunters, nosed\r\ngracefully up against the tide.\r\n\r\nHer anchor was cast, and there she rode, not twenty yards out from the\r\nshore.\r\n\r\nLike shadowy demons from some world beyond, arrived on some mission\r\nmysterious and tragic--some service of the foulest fiend in Hades--four\r\nhalf-seen figures moved along the railing of the craft, destroying the\r\nhope in Grenville's bosom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nADDITIONAL HEAD-HUNTERS\r\n\r\nThe boatmen thus newly arrived off the estuary's mouth were proceeding\r\nin a leisurely and confident manner to make themselves and their vessel\r\nsnug for the night, and Grenville had placed his second jug upon his\r\nraft when, without a sound having come to announce their movements, two\r\nor three Dyaks from the camp in the growth called some greeting or\r\nchallenge from the shore.\r\n\r\nThat their words were interpreted in a friendly spirit by the shadowy\r\nnatives on the anchored boat seemed to Grenville entirely obvious.\r\nThere was something akin to cheer in the voices that replied across the\r\nwater.  Every man was seen to halt at his work and come to the\r\nshoreward side of the craft, to peer through the darkness towards the\r\nbeach.\r\n\r\nThree of the fiends with whom he had waged unequal battle now appeared\r\non the sand strip a rod from where Sidney was standing.  Their backs\r\nwere presented as they called and gestured to the men beyond, and\r\nGrenville identified the chief once more by the fellow's unusual height.\r\n\r\nApparently an argument ensued, conducted, as to the shoreward end, by\r\nthe tall and dominant leader.  He waved quick, eloquent gestures,\r\nfrequently towards the headland whence Grenville had come.  That some\r\nreport of recent proceedings was being thus delivered there could be no\r\nreasonable doubt.  Expressions of astonishment, satisfaction, and a\r\ndiabolical glee came back in guttural staccatos from the blood-loving\r\ncreatures on the vessel.\r\n\r\nGrenville almost forgot where he was, and why, such indignation burned\r\nin his breast as he grasped at the substance of the conference thus\r\nheld across the tide.  Four more head-hunters, come to swell the\r\nalready heavily outnumbering forces of the island, was too much for\r\nHeaven to permit!  Against such odds and such diabolism, what possible\r\nchance----\r\n\r\nHe smiled in a grim, sardonic manner at the thought that a fight\r\nbetween himself and the now augmented Dyaks would ever again be likely,\r\nwith this boat anchored here before him, Dyaks camping in the jungle,\r\nand no trail left by which he could reach the terrace and Elaine, even\r\ncould he creep away in the shadows and silence of the thicket.\r\n\r\nIt appeared to him now that the chief on shore was becoming impatient,\r\nor angry.  He shouted orders and waved his hand down the length of the\r\nisland in a style growing rapidly more and more imperative, while the\r\nnew arrivals answered back in a stubborn and sullen dissatisfaction\r\nthat Sidney began to hope might lead to open rupture.  Should one of\r\nthe factions war against the other, he would think these four boatmen a\r\nGodsend.\r\n\r\nEven then, he reflected, the situation, as bearing on himself, might\r\npresent no altered aspect till all was decidedly too late.  Should he\r\nfail to return to Elaine with water to-night--she would doubtless never\r\nsee his face again.  Should morning still find him hiding here--their\r\nfates would have a sudden termination.  And now, with this craft at\r\nanchor in the current, so close inshore, there could be no chance to\r\nescape around it unobserved, what possible alternative was offered but\r\nto stand here, nearly to his waist in the water, aware that the\r\ndeadliest sort of snakes might be coiled within a foot of his hand?\r\n\r\nOne of the Dyaks a rod away now sat upon the sand.  The colloquy\r\ncontinued.  The domineering leader, waxing more and more imperious,\r\nmade gestures now in both directions.  That what he imparted and\r\ndeclared was again concerned with himself and Elaine, Grenville could\r\nnot fail to understand.  He was puzzled, however, to determine the\r\nreason for this lengthy contest of words.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to his mind the dispute might have sprung from rival claims\r\nas to sharing the trophies, when, at last, the defenders of the terrace\r\nshould no longer require their heads.  The ghastliness of the\r\nsuggestion did not greatly disturb him; he was too far dulled and\r\nwearied by things already undergone.\r\n\r\nWhen it seemed at last as if the verbal combat might result in a\r\ndeadlier feud, the matter between the land and water factions was\r\nsuddenly adjusted with accents amazingly mild from either side.\r\nConsiderably to Grenville's astonishment, the boatmen heaved up their\r\nanchor, eased off their sail, and put about towards the farther end of\r\nthe island.\r\n\r\nThe three men ashore called out additional instructions, presumably,\r\nand followed for a distance down the shore.  The boat was presently\r\ngone from Sidney's view.  He did not stir, though he ached in every\r\nbone and muscle, from his long, hard session of suffering and toil, and\r\nthis cramp and strain of hiding.  He was well aware that even the Dyaks\r\nwould soon be obliged, either to retrace their steps and return as they\r\nhad come, or force a way up through the jungle to cross to the island's\r\nfarther side.\r\n\r\nThat the vessel would join the others, already at anchor behind the\r\nsecond hill, he had finally comprehended with a wildness of hope his\r\nheart could scarcely contain.  The chief had undoubtedly ordered the\r\ncraft away from this particular anchorage lest it be too readily seen.\r\n\r\nWith barely a grunt or two of conversation between them, the trio seen\r\nbefore him on the sand now presently returned.  They stood about the\r\nestuary inlet for a moment, as if debating some second affair of\r\nimportance, then finally glided away.\r\n\r\nEven then Grenville stirred with silent caution, waiting with\r\nheartbeats once more quickened lest he move too soon, and be discovered\r\nafter all.  The place, however, was deserted.  Stiffly, but none the\r\nless eagerly, and alert for the slightest alarm, he coaxed his raft\r\nfrom the overhanging shrubbery, urged it gently out across the bar,\r\nand, hurriedly lashing his jugs to the braces provided, pushed away and\r\nheaded far out in the tide.\r\n\r\nThe current had turned.  It was flowing strongly towards the cliff, in\r\na certain impetuous manner that was far from being assuring.  For\r\nwhile, in a measure, it assisted Grenville's float, it swirled and\r\nbattled with other counter currents, into which he was helplessly\r\ncarried.  His frail, narrow raft was not infrequently threatened with\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nTwice, for a second, he well-nigh despaired of righting before he\r\nshould sink or plunge end downward, capsizing himself and his jugs.  He\r\nwas shot far outward from his course by one of the treacherous torrents\r\nof tide, then rocketed straight for the rocks of the cliff by another.\r\nHis paddles were wholly inadequate for such a struggle; his arms\r\nrefused the demands that his will insistently made upon them.  It\r\nseemed as if he must break at some vital center of his being before he\r\nat length was enabled to avoid a collision with the cliff.  Then he\r\nsank exhausted, obliged for a moment to pause and rest, when the tide\r\nonce more drifted him outward.\r\n\r\nBefore he could rouse his flagging sinews to another effort, he had\r\nfloated by the cave.  He was prodded to new desperation.  The struggle\r\nhe waged to regain that rocky niche--only to have the whirlpool cast\r\nhim to the outside current as before, with his raft entirely\r\nsubmerged---was enough to break his heart.\r\n\r\nNothing save the thought of Elaine could have availed to spur him yet\r\nonce more to fighting vigor.  He did fight again, till it seemed he\r\nmust topple like a man of lead, and sink almost gladly in the sea, with\r\na sense of welcome to its endless peace.\r\n\r\nA weak and staggering figure he presented when the landing was finally\r\nachieved.  He barely pulled his raft within the cavern.  He had no\r\nstrength left to conceal it in the passage.\r\n\r\nHugging his two heavy jugs of precious liquid, and also with the bottle\r\nweighing down his pocket, he groped and stumbled slowly up the gallery,\r\npausing with ever increasing frequency to lean against the walls and\r\nrecuperate his strength.\r\n\r\nElaine was aroused from a state of lethargy, where she watched and\r\nlistened at the upper door, by sounds that for a moment filled her with\r\nalarm.  That some noisily breathing animal was making its way up the\r\npassage from the sea was her first half-waking impression.\r\n\r\nWith a cry of relief and worry blended, she immediately understood.  It\r\nwas Grenville's labored panting she had heard, where he would not call\r\nfor assistance for fear she should be alarmed.  She caught up the torch\r\nshe had kept so faithfully alight for his guidance, and ran hastily\r\ndown to give him welcome.\r\n\r\nHe was leaning against the wall once more, his mouth a little open for\r\nthe air his lungs demanded, his face drawn and white with his utter\r\nweakness and exhaustion.  In one keen glance Elaine comprehended his\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n\"Sidney!\" she cried.  \"Oh! but why did you go?  Why would you work so\r\nhard to-night?\"\r\n\r\nHe could conjure no smile to his lips.  \"I love you, Elaine,\" he\r\nanswered.  \"It kills me to see you suffer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh please--please don't,\" she begged him.  Her eyes were brimming with\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nHe sank on the floor of the passage as he tried once more to raise the\r\njugs.  And yet, when Elaine pounced eagerly upon the bottle full of\r\nwater, and pressed it to his lips, his stubborn resistance was once\r\nmore reasserted.  He accepted a few sips only, then thrust it firmly\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\"That last little pull was steeper than I thought,\" he admitted, as he\r\nforced himself to rise and set his jugs more carefully in the rocks\r\nagainst the wall.  \"If you will oblige me by taking a drink of\r\nwater----\"\r\n\r\n\"Not now,\" Elaine interrupted, as self-denying as before.  \"I am not\r\nthe least bit thirsty.  If you'll only rest--if you'll go to sleep----\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall go to no rest till you have taken a cup of water.\"\r\n\r\nShe knew he would not.  She drank from the bottle, perhaps three\r\nordinary swallows of the liquid, like nectar to her palate.\r\n\r\n\"Good-night,\" he said, with a touch of his old-time brusqueness, and,\r\nadding nothing more, he continued on to the barrier and out to his post\r\nof duty.  There he sank on a rock before the door to guard Elaine from\r\nharm.\r\n\r\nElaine, softly crying, went back at last to her couch.  And some time,\r\ndeep in the silence of the night, she awoke sufficiently to creep to\r\nthe door, where she listened to Grenville, deeply sleeping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nPLOT AND COUNTER PLOT\r\n\r\nThe smoke that for two forbidding days had veiled and grayed the\r\nheadland, continued to drift from the jungle, when Grenville roused\r\nfrom his slumber.\r\n\r\nHe was much refreshed, yet had not entirely recuperated the strength so\r\ndrained in the night.  The aspect of the barren rock, engulfed in the\r\nfumes, was only what he had expected.  He felt convinced that, like the\r\nmistral of the Riviera, this wind would continue for three full days at\r\nleast.  And the Dyaks were hardly likely to permit an abatement of the\r\nsmoke while it brought no discomfort to themselves.\r\n\r\nApparently they had made no effort to bridge the gap that rendered the\r\ntrail completely useless.  It was clear to Sidney's mind, however, that\r\nso soon as they believed the adventure safe, they would swarm upon the\r\nterrace, if for nothing else, then in search of heads and the treasure.\r\n\r\nWith the possible development of an earlier plan in his mind, he\r\ncrossed at once to his cannon, loaded and primed in its bed, and began\r\nto adjust a lot of loose stones above and upon it, to hide it\r\ncompletely from view.  The fuse he drew, meantime, aside, where he\r\nmeant to splice another length to its end.\r\n\r\nElaine came out from the narrow confines of her gallery in the hope of\r\nlending assistance.  She was wearing the tiger's jeweled collar about\r\nher slender waist.\r\n\r\n\"I'm hiding the gun--masking our battery,\" Sidney informed her,\r\nquietly.  \"Its muzzle is still unobstructed and pointed as before.  In\r\ncase it seems wise to permit the Dyaks to climb up at last and look\r\nabout, I prefer they shouldn't steal our thunder.\"  If he noted the\r\ngolden girdle, he made no unusual sign.\r\n\r\nElaine was considerably puzzled.\r\n\r\n\"But--why should we let them come?\"\r\n\r\n\"To convince them their prisoners have flown.  It may give us a chance\r\nto punish them harder, later on.\"\r\n\r\n\"If a steamer would only come!\" she said, turning vainly to the sea,\r\nstill shrouded from view.  \"Even a Chinese junk!  Anything, almost, but\r\nmore of these horrible fiends!\"\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" continued Grenville, \"I can make an imitation cannon, from\r\none of my bamboo lengths, and leave it here to fool them.  They may be\r\nled to think it the only gun we've had, and search no farther for our\r\nordnance.  The smoke is likely to lift, I think, which is why I'm at\r\nwork before breakfast.\"\r\n\r\nHe did not complete the arrangements of his ruse before they broke\r\ntheir fast, however, since the making of an imitation cannon required\r\nat least an hour.  The last of their meat, save a little intended for\r\nfishing-bait, was consumed with the insignificant remnants of their\r\nfruit supply, and Grenville took time to catch one silvery fish from\r\nthe ledge in front of the cavern, as well as to gather a lot of the\r\nmussels, for luncheon and dinner, before he returned to the terrace.\r\n\r\nAlready the breeze was failing.  There were streaks of highly\r\nacceptable air interspersed with the billows of smoke.  Not without a\r\ncertain impatience to have this business concluded before the veiling\r\nfumes should leave the terrace entirely exposed to the penetrative\r\nsight of the Dyaks, Grenville hastened the construction of his\r\nimitation gun, to be left by the heap of stones.\r\n\r\nThat a more convincing appearance of over-use might assist in creating\r\nthe desired impression, he selected one of the bamboo sections already\r\nbadly split.  This he readily blackened by burning a handful of powder,\r\nloosely, inside its muzzle.  With a rude vent cut and similarly\r\ntreated, the affair was ready to be bound with discarded creepers, then\r\nlodged in the rocks above the genuine bit of artillery still ready for\r\ngrim engagements.\r\n\r\nAll that remained of the powder in his cave was carefully moved to the\r\npassage, there to be most cautiously deposited, away from all possible\r\nfire, along with his coils of fuse.  Somewhat to his disappointment,\r\nthe northerly breeze seemed once more freshening as the morning hours\r\nadvanced.  He had hoped not only for a lifting of the smoke, but\r\nlikewise to find the Dyaks' boat once more encircling the headland.\r\n\r\nBeyond transferring his water supply from the jugs to a number of\r\nbamboo buckets, which permitted no waste by percolation, he had nothing\r\nfurther to employ his time as the day wore slowly on.  The heat in the\r\nmeantime was intolerable.  The fish was roasted in an \"oven\" he\r\nfashioned of the heat-retaining tufa.  The mussels were likewise\r\n\"steamed\" in their own exuding juices, occupying the large and\r\nbasin-like sea-shell for the purpose.\r\n\r\nIt was not until nearly four in the afternoon that the wind definitely\r\nveered.  Grenville had noted the coming alteration that would clear the\r\nhill of fumes in time to make all essential preparations for the Dyak\r\nwatchfulness.  His furnace of fire was duly banked, to continue a\r\nsmoldering glow among the ashes without producing smoke.  Elaine had\r\nretired within the passage, and the entrance door to this secret\r\nhiding-place was adjusted against the rock.\r\n\r\nGrenville remained upon the terrace.  No less a degree of vigilance\r\nthan that previously exercised was, he felt, highly essential.\r\nConcealed in the caves or rocks comprised by the former camp he could\r\nnot only guard against surprise by a bridging of the ruined trail, but\r\nhis view of the sea, that might once more be haunted by the Dyak craft,\r\nwas practicably without limit.\r\n\r\nApparently the Dyaks, too, had been aware the breeze would serve them\r\nno longer.  The smudges in the jungle were extinguished.  In a time\r\ncomparatively brief, after the shifting of the wind, no smoke at all\r\nwas visible.  But during the final hour preceding sunset another phase\r\nof fiendish ingenuity developed.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks began shooting arrows of fire all about on the summit of the\r\nterrace.  They were shafts made highly inflammable by means of resin\r\nand pitch.  Their flight through the air was not sufficiently violent\r\nto extinguish their glowing ends.  If they did not blaze upon alighting\r\non the rocks, they still retained sufficient heat and redness to ignite\r\na pan of powder.\r\n\r\nIt was this that occurred to Grenville as he made up his mind that some\r\ngenius of diabolism among the new arrivals was doubtless responsible\r\nfor this effort to explode his magazine.  His satisfaction with himself\r\nfor his foresight in storing his powder anew was his one real joy of\r\nthe day.  He wondered how long this business might continue, and how\r\nmany of the enemy must now be reckoned with.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, with the four who had come under cover of the\r\nnight, there were nine unscathed by previous engagements.  Also, it\r\nwas, as Grenville had suspected, one of the latest comers who had\r\ncounseled the use of burning arrows.  Since the terrace defenders were\r\nemploying some dreaded explosive, the one course readily suggested was\r\nto reach his supply with a brand of fire--and, perhaps, thereby destroy\r\nits maker.  In any event, deprived of this one deadly means of defense,\r\nthe whites could be readily slaughtered.\r\n\r\nAlready the Dyaks had built a bridge, to be used, when the time should\r\nat last arrive, for spanning that gap on the trail.  It was not\r\nimpossible, many had urged, that the prisoners lodged on the headland's\r\nsummit were already either dead or dying.  How they had managed to\r\nsurvive so long, with no supply of water, was sufficiently mysterious.\r\nShould they still be found alive another day--all the greater the joy\r\nof bringing about the end!\r\n\r\nThe Dyak plan for reaching the magazine had been too hastily concocted.\r\nThe supply of tarred and resined arrows was decidedly insufficient.\r\nLess than a score had been sent to the top of the terrace when the last\r\nwas speeded on its way.  But during the short remaining hour of\r\ndaylight, and even by firelight, after dark, the shafts accumulated\r\nswiftly, against the coming of the dawn.\r\n\r\nMeantime to Grenville had come an inspiration.  His one clear hope for\r\nthe morning was that more of the arrows might be shot from below to\r\nmake his plans complete.  If the Dyaks were busy after dark, they could\r\nscarcely have matched the fever with which he likewise toiled.\r\n\r\nDown to the cool, dry chamber of the cavern he had carried no less than\r\neight of his largest bombs, with coil upon coil of his fuse.  Two mines\r\nof four bombs each he planted, concealing all with rocks.  From each of\r\nthe mines one fuse only was laid, to the inner angle of the passage.\r\nEach bomb had a shorter bit of fuse thrust in a handful of powder, to\r\nwhich the two main fuses led.  The lines were carefully protected, not\r\nonly against discovery, but as well against himself, or his boots, as\r\nhe tramped back and forth from the cave.  When this arrangement had\r\nbeen made complete, he could do no more in that direction till his\r\nfavorable hour should arrive.\r\n\r\nHis next attention was directed to his bamboo float, which had been\r\npractically dismembered.  He had utilized the heavy stems to construct\r\na long and narrow platform, with two rude hooks lashed on the end to\r\nengage a rung of his ladder.  This ladder he not only lowered down from\r\nthe wall to a position in front of the cavern's opening, securing its\r\nend with more than ordinary caution among the rocks he piled upon it,\r\nbut also he had tested the length, and every rung, by extending his\r\nplatform across from the ledge and climbing from the sea to the terrace.\r\n\r\nIt was midnight before his final preparation was complete.  This had\r\nbeen simply arranged.  He had carried a canister of powder to the\r\noutside rocks, considerably back of Elaine's former shelter, together\r\nwith two small bombs.  The powder he laid in a six-foot ring, or\r\nspiral, that narrowed towards the center, merely to provide a lasting\r\nand widespread flash when at length it should be ignited.\r\n\r\nThe bombs were placed near by, simply laid in a cave of no considerable\r\ndimensions.  Their fuses were trailed across the rocks to a place of\r\nobservation, and were opened out in such a manner as to fire both the\r\nspiral and the noisy but harmless explosives.\r\n\r\nDespite his nervous tension and the worry occasioned in his mind, lest,\r\nthe Dyaks fail of their allotted part, Grenville finally slept as\r\nsoundly as a boy, when at length he could work no more.  But Elaine,\r\nstrangely tingling with apprehension, concerned with the part that she\r\nmust likewise play to render his plans effective, had not Sidney's\r\nweariness to overcome her nerves, and therefore rested badly.\r\n\r\nFor long she lay there, listening, as always, to the silence enfolding\r\nthe island, thinking how fair it had really been when the wail alone\r\nhad been with them, and wondering, eagerly wondering, if by chance her\r\ncompanion of the hours both bright and dark had noticed the girdle she\r\nwas wearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nA LIVING BAIT\r\n\r\nThe morning dawned in beauty, a few clouds riding with thistle-down\r\nlightness athwart the illimitable dome of blue, as intense as that of\r\nthe sea.  A light breeze stirred in the jungle, to wander aimlessly\r\nfrom one deep chalice of fragrance to another, before it trailed across\r\nthe hill.  Sea tang arose from the restless tide, that washed at the\r\ncliff incessantly.\r\n\r\nAs far as sight could pursue the richness of its causeway, the sun laid\r\ngold in glittering mosaic across the tropic ocean.  Never had the\r\nsparkling waves seemed brighter, the world more promising, as Elaine\r\npeered forth through her chink in the door, awaiting--God only knew\r\nwhat.\r\n\r\nShe had never been more excited, and rarely more alarmed.  The unknown\r\nelement in Grenville's plans kept her nerves at the highest tension.\r\nThey had eaten a breakfast solely of fish before the light of daybreak.\r\nGrenville had carefully closed the passage barrier, and crept out upon\r\nthe terrace.  On no account must she open the door, or call him, to her\r\nside.  She must wait, and not even expect to hear a report of what was\r\noccurring.\r\n\r\nThe longest cord she had ever helped to braid was lightly secured to\r\nher arm.  Its farther end was tied in the rocks at the lower exit of\r\nthe passage.  Until she should feel his tug upon this signal line, she\r\ncould only imagine that Sidney was near, or, perhaps, was climbing down\r\nhis ladder.\r\n\r\nShe dreaded the thought of that ladder, so frailly depending above the\r\nrocks and water, not to mention all its use might mean when the time\r\nfor the signal should arrive.  And she might be obliged to wait all\r\nday, as Sidney had warned her, duly--all day, while the wildest, the\r\nmost tormenting of conjectures would leisurely elaborate themselves in\r\nher brain to convince her that Sidney was no more.\r\n\r\nShould he fall from the cliff, should he chance to underestimate the\r\nDyaks' treacherous activities--should any one of a dozen possible\r\ncalamities occur--how long must she wait till she knew?\r\n\r\nMeantime Grenville was barely less keyed to excited expectancy than\r\nElaine in her prison-like retreat.  Times without number he goaded his\r\nmind to review once more the inventory of his scheme, where the lack of\r\none small detail might prove his entire undoing.  Yet, after all, there\r\nwere a few links only in the chain, though each was vitally important.\r\n\r\nHe counted them over carefully--the signs or proof of calamity, here on\r\nthe hill, to convince the head-hunting demons his magazine was gone,\r\nand with it all possible defense; the ladder and platform down below,\r\nwhereby he could reach the cave; the bombs for the climax, should his\r\nhope succeed; and fire for their certain ignition.\r\n\r\nHe had taken a double precaution to provide himself with fire.  Down in\r\nthe passage several brands were smoldering slowly in their ashes, while\r\nothers did the same on the hill.  He could think of nothing\r\nlacking--not even the cord to warn Elaine to open her door and flee\r\noutside when at length he should give her the signal!\r\n\r\nBut as if in mockery of all this careful business, the day began with\r\nnever a sign from the jungle.  The Dyaks, he feared, had altered their\r\nplan, and might shoot no more of their arrows.  He could not have known\r\nthey were waiting for the breeze to freshen and fill a certain sail.\r\nOne of their boats had been prepared and manned to police the headland\r\nas before.\r\n\r\nWhen Grenville at length beheld it, gracefully sharp and picturesque,\r\nas it rounded towards the master cliff, he was filled with conflicting\r\nemotions.  He had wished for this, precisely, but not without the rest.\r\nThe arrows first, had been his hope, and then this silent vulture,\r\natilt in the purple tides.\r\n\r\nThe arrows presently arrived.  He was still engaged in watching the\r\nmovements of the boat, in an effort to count the crew, when the first\r\nof the flaming messengers struck dully against a bowlder and lay there,\r\nfiercely blazing.\r\n\r\nThen the sudden flight, which, against an inky background, must have\r\npresented an extraordinary spectacle, afforded a sight strange enough,\r\nas Grenville presently conceded.  The pitch and resin with which the\r\nshafts were tipped, burned with a black and heavy smoke, that trailed\r\nin their wakes like nebulous tails of cloud-producing comets.  There\r\nwere some of the flames that the flight only served to fan to fiercer\r\nheat and color.  Like a candle sputtering in a draught they sounded as\r\nthey flew.\r\n\r\nOthers that lost their yellow blaze smoked the more blackly in the air.\r\nIn half a dozen different spots the hotly burning lengths of wood were\r\nsoon consuming bits of scattered leaves and grass, one almost at\r\nGrenville's feet.\r\n\r\nHe was soon convinced that, should this rain of fire be long continued,\r\nhe should have no need to fire his bombs and spiral.  The arrows would\r\nactually accomplish the mission for which they were intended.  He had\r\nno wish for a premature climax to the singular attack, but rather hoped\r\nto create the impression he was fighting desperately to protect his\r\nmagazine.\r\n\r\nWhen a heap of waste and useless creepers was presently ignited, he ran\r\nfrom his place and promptly beat it out.  He wished he might be seen.\r\nHe was gratified without delay.  The rifleman, posted, as on previous\r\noccasions, in the rocks that crowned the second hill, promptly\r\ndischarged his erratic weapon, and nearly killed one of his kind.\r\n\r\nGrenville ran as if to cover.  A shout of exultation came from below.\r\nA larger and swifter flight of the blazing shafts immediately ensued.\r\n\r\nSidney now cast a glance about for the ship that was cruising by the\r\nheadland.  Somewhat to his disappointment it had gone about as if to\r\nreturn to the west, from which the cave, his platform, and ladder could\r\nnot, of course, be seen.  He fancied, however, it had come up in stays\r\nat the sound of the shot on the hill.  It certainly appeared to be\r\npaying off to continue about the headland.  He dared not longer delay.\r\n\r\nThe arrows were blazing all about him.  He feared at last that one\r\nlucky shot might even fire his cannon.  Almost amused by the irony of\r\nthe situation, he caught up the nearest blazing shaft of fire, and used\r\nit to light his fuse.\r\n\r\nIn the briefest time the serpent of fire sped down through the hollowed\r\ncreeper to the spiral, where, also, lay the bombs.  Of a sudden the\r\npowder was ignited.\r\n\r\nWith a flash of quickly leaping flames and a grayish geyser of fume,\r\nthe destruction began.  Then, as a cry of glee arose from the clearing\r\nbelow, the bombs went off in quick succession.\r\n\r\nThey made a splendid noise and smoke, scattering fragments of the tufa\r\nfar and wide, till a rain of the smaller pieces spattered thickly down\r\nin the jungle.  Grenville arose from his hiding-place, quite unharmed,\r\nand ran about on the terrace crazily, holding his head between his\r\nhands for the distant rifleman to witness his discomfort.\r\n\r\nThe Dyak was overjoyed.  He shouted in reckless delight to his kind,\r\nwho howled like a pack of wolves now certain of feasting.  Yet they did\r\nnot emerge from their places of concealment, nor undertake to bridge\r\nthe trail, and immediately ascend the hill, as Grenville had somewhat\r\nfeared.\r\n\r\nHe crept to a point of vantage, watching the clearing for a\r\ndemonstration which, much to his gratification, did not arrive.  Back\r\nonce more towards the cliff at the rear he scuttled, beholding the Dyak\r\ncraft at last heading well around towards the cave.  The moment was\r\nripe for his scheme!\r\n\r\nHurriedly creeping to the eastern brink, with one of his firebrands\r\ngripped between his teeth, he began a descent of the ladder.  Halfway\r\ndown he paused for breath, and furtively watched, from the tail of his\r\neye, for the boat that should presently appear.\r\n\r\nIt came within range of his vision silently, and down he continued as\r\nbefore.  He could only hope that he might have been seen, for never a\r\nsound arose from the crew to make the matter certain.  For, perhaps, a\r\ndistance of twenty feet he must have been plainly in view.  The last\r\nfleeting sight he caught of the boat, she was putting about with a\r\nsuddenness enormously exciting to his blood.\r\n\r\nThat the Dyaks had seen him, and were now intent upon turning away\r\nbefore he should turn and see their boat, and know himself discovered,\r\nwas an inescapable conclusion.  A moment later he was hidden by the\r\nledge, and descended more at leisure, climbing inside the ladder\r\npresently, where it hung well out from the overhanging shelf, and so\r\ncoming down upon his platform, with little or no exertion.\r\n\r\nImmediately on landing under the mouth of the cavern, he lifted the\r\nplatform bodily, disengaged the hooks from the ladder's lower rung, and\r\ndrew it behind him to the cave.  The ladder itself he could not remove\r\nwithout climbing up to the terrace and issuing forth at the hidden\r\ndoor, which would doubtless prove fatal to his plans.\r\n\r\nHe proceeded at once to his supplementary firebrands, in the larger\r\nspread of the gallery.  Here all was going well.  He extinguished one\r\nor two branches of the smoldering wood, to conserve the limited supply.\r\nAfter that it was simply a matter of waiting.\r\n\r\nHow long it would take for the boat crew to land, inform their fellow\r\nhead-hunters of what they had seen, and fetch the entire company to\r\ncapture him, here in the chamber, was not a matter for easy estimation.\r\nHe hoped it might happen soon.\r\n\r\nIn this he was doomed to disappointment.  The Dyak sailors had seen\r\nhim, clearly enough.  They had hastened back to report this eminently\r\nsatisfying outcome of their tactics, and the nine eager fiends had then\r\nand there commenced their counter scheming.  But they meant to commit\r\nno errors, assume no unnecessary risks.\r\n\r\nFor, notwithstanding the fact they were fully convinced the white man's\r\nexplosives had been reached by their arrows and destroyed, they\r\nretained a vivid memory of punishments inflicted by the gun, where one\r\nmore deadly hail of slugs might lurk to find them again.  It was,\r\nhowever, important that one or more men should mount the terrace, to\r\nwatch at the head of the white man's ladder, and even render its use a\r\nfatal experiment, should the climber attempt to regain the summit by\r\nits means.\r\n\r\nThey began investigations cautiously--all noted by Elaine.  Peering\r\nbreathlessly out at her narrow chink, her heart consumed with haunting\r\nworries, lest Grenville had met with some accident when the bombs were\r\nfinally exploded, she now beheld a pair of the Dyaks in the clearing,\r\napparently exposing themselves as if to draw any latent fire from the\r\nhill.\r\n\r\nAs the minutes went by and trouble failed to come, their boldness\r\nplainly increased.  They were not particularly hurried, however, in\r\nproducing their bridge for the trail.  When at length four natives\r\nbrought it from the jungle, Elaine's heart pounded in her breast like a\r\nhammer forging at her soul.\r\n\r\nShe had instantly recognized the bamboo platform.  She thought that\r\nSidney ought to come--to know of what was occurring.  But he did not\r\ncome, and could not leave his post below, where one of his fuses, he\r\nhad found, had opened and spilt out its powder.  This he was feverishly\r\nand gingerly working to repair, by the light of a glowing brand.\r\n\r\nNot for a moment daring to abandon her place by the door, Elaine felt a\r\nhorrible sense of weakness attack her entire system as the Dyaks\r\ncautiously adjusted their bridge, while watching against a new surprise.\r\n\r\nThat the four men now constantly visible must presently succeed in\r\nplacing the slender platform from one broken ledge to the other, to\r\nmount in full possession of the terrace, Elaine could not fail to\r\ncomprehend.  The impulse to creep from her hiding-place and once more\r\nfire the cannon was fairly overwhelming.  She was certain that Sidney,\r\nwith all his wonderful scheming, had never contemplated this!\r\n\r\nHe had simply instructed her to wait--to remain in the passage, behind\r\nthe concealing barrier, no matter what occurred, till she felt at last\r\nthe tug of the cord on her arm.  She felt she must obey, that even to\r\ndesert her post for the little time required to hasten down the gallery\r\nand let him know of the dangers now about her might cost them\r\neverything!\r\n\r\nNever had she in her life been subjected to such a trial as that which\r\npresently developed.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks had spanned the gap where the ledge was broken.  Two of them\r\ncrept a little forward on the bridge.  It was now or never to fire the\r\ngun, while the four were still in range.  She dared not disobey the\r\norder given by her chief.  Suddenly darting past the spot where the\r\ncannon had taken its toll before, the Dyaks gained the summit--and were\r\nfinally in possession of the camp!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nLONG HOURS OF DOUBT\r\n\r\nGrenville had hoped to be able to hasten for a moment up the gallery\r\nand assure Elaine that all was well, and the matter now merely one of\r\npatience.\r\n\r\nHis belated discovery that one of his fuses was deficient had somewhat\r\nshaken his nerves.  Except for this timely restoration, his whole\r\nproject must have been weakened, perhaps to absolute failure.  His line\r\nof fuse was necessarily long, to assure essential safety for himself.\r\nHe was obsessed with a fear that countless defects might have developed\r\nin the long line of powder-loaded creeper since the day it was made and\r\nlaid away.\r\n\r\nIn a fever of anxious searching, he examined practically every inch of\r\nboth the lines, meantime returning frequently to the cavern's mouth, to\r\nguard against surprise.  Before he felt certain the fuse could all be\r\nrelied upon to perform its part in the business, he finally detected a\r\nDyak boat attempting to go about and escape his possible observation\r\nfrom the dark retreat, while obviously hovering near, to watch that he\r\ndid not escape.\r\n\r\nAfter that he dared not for a moment desert his post.  And the longer\r\nthe expected Dyaks remained away, the more imperative became his\r\nwatchfulness and constant attendance at the cave.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, up at her flimsy door, Elaine leaned affrightedly against\r\nthe chilling wall, no longer peering forth at the chink, but tensely\r\nlistening--listening for the sounds of feet above her head.  All four\r\nof the Dyaks were there on the terrace, and, therefore, a few rods only\r\nfrom the passage in which she crouched, alone.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to see, save the platform and part of the trail, and\r\nshe dared not stand so close to the door, lest her very breathing, or\r\nthe beat of her heart, betray her presence at her post.\r\n\r\nWhen at length the unmistakable sound of beings on the rocks directly\r\noverhead came dully down through the roof of pitted stone, she shrank\r\nentirely down to the floor, her heart in a sickening flutter.  Just to\r\nhave cried out Sidney's name and to run like a child down the passage\r\nto his arms, would have been a relief so incredibly vast its comfort\r\ncould not have been measured.\r\n\r\nBut she did not move.  She still obeyed, like the faithful comrade in\r\narms she was, awaiting her portion, allotted by the Fates, though it\r\nmight be death in its most revolting form.\r\n\r\nWhat sounds were made by the Dyaks, in retreat from that particular\r\nposition, failed to come down through the rock.  She was, therefore,\r\ndenied the abatement of her apprehension which she might otherwise have\r\nknown.  She was thoroughly convinced that one of the fiends had been\r\nposted above the passage opening to remain indefinitely on guard.\r\n\r\nThe Dyaks had, however, concluded their examination of the terrace\r\nrather promptly.  There was almost nothing worth investigation.\r\nGrenville's imitation cannon had served its purpose to perfection.  The\r\nhead-hunters marveled that a gun so simply and readily constructed\r\ncould have wrought such havoc in their ranks.  But they found no reason\r\nto doubt it had been used, and they readily overlooked the small brass\r\npiece so artfully hidden by the stones.\r\n\r\nThey had lost no time in removing the bowlders that supported Sidney's\r\nladder.  One or two only they suffered to remain--sufficient to anchor\r\nthe affair in place, yet permit their man to drop back in the tide,\r\nshould he intrust his weight to it.\r\n\r\nThat the white man's powder magazine had been greatly diminished before\r\ntheir flaming arrows completed its destruction seemed indisputable.\r\nThe bombs had torn out and blackened so much of a cavity that the\r\nDyaks' gratification was complete.  It was scarcely possible, they\r\nargued, that the man seen running crazily about had escaped a mortal\r\nhurt.  He had certainly summoned the strength to escape to the cave,\r\nbut there he might have died.\r\n\r\nAll the waste sections of Sidney's bamboo were thrown with his cannon\r\nand his flag-pole in the sea.  A thorough search was made of Elaine's\r\nformer shelter, as well as of all the rock heaps on the place, for the\r\ntreasure the man might have taken from the cave and concealed about his\r\ncamp.\r\n\r\nNot until some time after noon did the visitors finally leave the hill\r\nand disappear in the jungle growth to mature their further plans.\r\nElaine knew nothing of their departure.  She still remained back in the\r\ndarkness of the gallery, and, therefore, neither heard nor saw the\r\nmovements made on the ledge.  She was hardly less prepared than before\r\nto see the door of the gallery rudely torn away at any moment, and the\r\nhideous head-hunters confidently pouncing in upon her.\r\n\r\nGrenville, down in the blackness of the cavern, was hardly more easy in\r\nhis mind.  The Dyaks had failed to appear before the cave.  He realized\r\nthey might conclude to starve him to death in the tomb-like place,\r\nrather than risk another of his traps.  To return to the terrace was\r\nout of the question.  Not only might the natives be present, but, if\r\nonce he were seen, they must immediately realize he had some unknown\r\nmeans of passage from the cave to the summit.\r\n\r\nThat the ladder would be watched he was certain.  It was also more than\r\nlikely, he was sure, the Dyaks would either cut through the strands to\r\nweaken it, near the top, or displace the rocks he had heaped upon its\r\nend.  Reflecting that to pull it down while one of their craft was\r\ncruising about the headland might convince them he had fallen in the\r\nsea, he laid his platform out on the ledge for the purpose before the\r\nterrace had been deserted.  But the boat was not to be seen.\r\n\r\nAt noon the sun beat down on the rocks about the cave with a hot,\r\nintolerable glare.  Grenville was weary, as well as thirsty once more,\r\nand faint from lack of food.  He dared not abandon the cavern now,\r\nhowever, since any moment might find the Dyaks slipping to the open\r\nniche to complete the deed they had vainly attempted before.\r\n\r\nNever had the long, sultry hours of afternoon dragged by more\r\ntediously.  Never had the man so vividly realized how much it meant to\r\nbe near Elaine, to hear her voice, to gaze in the depths of her eyes.\r\n\r\nIt was not till the sun was about to set that his long, impatient vigil\r\nwas somewhat rewarded at last.  The Dyak boat drifted barely in sight,\r\nas he crouched there on the shattered ledge.\r\n\r\nWithout a moment's hesitation, even as he saw that the craft was\r\nbeating back, as before, to the shelter behind the cliff, he ran out\r\nhis platform, dropped its end across a rung of the ladder, and cast a\r\nheavy stone as far out upon it as possible.\r\n\r\nIt hung there, solidly enough, for a moment, then slipped a foot--and\r\nabruptly the whole writhing length came down, to land in the whirlpool\r\nand sink.  The platform, however, was recovered.  Returning at once to\r\nhis place behind the wall, Sidney waited in new expectancy for the\r\nDyaks to appear.\r\n\r\nThey did not come.  The sun went down--and with it Grenville's hope.\r\nThe head-hunters feared him still!  They must have determined some\r\ntrick was prepared against their invasion of the cave!  He was utterly\r\nsick with discouragement.  His long, hard day, to say nothing of\r\nElaine's, had been spent like this, in vain.  He felt he had merely\r\nlost ground.  The Dyaks were doubtless already in possession of the\r\nterrace, where he could not attack them to advantage, since precisely\r\nas soon as he made his appearance on the hill-top the passage must be\r\nrevealed.\r\n\r\nHe clung to the hope that dusk would bring the murderous pack to his\r\nstand--that they might have waited for darkness to sneak upon him\r\nunawares.  But the twilight faded into blackest night, with clouds\r\nobscuring the friendly stars, and still no head-hunters came.\r\n\r\nWhen at length he was certain no native would dare intrust himself or\r\nhis boat to the treacherous maelstrom of the niche, he abandoned hope\r\nfor the night.  Returning to the passageway, he closed its door behind\r\nhim, secured it with the bar, and groped his way upward through the\r\nvelvet gloom for a word of cheer with Elaine.\r\n\r\nHe called to her softly as he came towards the top, and she hastened\r\ndown to meet him.  She was certain something had gone amiss, but her\r\ncourage was sufficient to sustain almost anything, so long as she knew\r\nhe was safe.\r\n\r\n\"Got a bit hungry,\" he told her, off-handedly.  \"Those chaps do keep\r\none waiting!\"\r\n\r\n\"Sh-s-s-sh!\" she said, in a warning whisper; \"I think they're just\r\noutside.\"\r\n\r\n\"You saw them come up?\" he asked her, eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"Four of them--after you fired the bombs.  They put a bridge across the\r\nhole, as you thought, perhaps, they might.\"\r\n\r\n\"H'm,\" said Sidney, quietly, going to the door and peering forth on the\r\njungle.  \"They haven't gone down since?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not that I saw.  I wasn't watching all the while.\"\r\n\r\n\"You haven't heard them talking, near the door?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, oh no!  I haven't heard a thing!  I haven't known what to do--or\r\nwhether you were alive or dead.  I didn't know what my duty was when I\r\nsaw them come up, and wanted to fire the cannon!  I thought the day\r\nwould never end!  Have you had to give up at last?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly not!\" he assured her, cheerfully, aware from every accent of\r\nher voice what tortures she had suffered there alone.  \"I must soon\r\nreturn--and you must go to bed.  I haven't the slightest idea they will\r\ncome before next high tide, about eight, or later, in the morning.\r\nMeantime you did exactly right.  They haven't the slightest notion of\r\nthis secret passage, you may be sure, or nothing on earth could have\r\nkept them out.  And they long since returned to their boats....  I\r\nsuppose you have had neither food nor water.  A little hurried supper\r\nfor us both, and I must go down to the basement for the night.\"\r\n\r\nElaine had removed the cord from her arm, and secured it by the door.\r\nSidney ignited a slender piece of torch-wood, by the smoldering brands\r\nmaintained in the upper passage.  He carried it promptly around the\r\nangle of the gallery, however, as an added precaution against the\r\nescape of one revealing beam through the chink that pierced the barrier\r\nfacing the jungle world.\r\n\r\nThe dinner they ate was neither warm nor comforting.  Cold fish is\r\nbarely sustaining, while the tonic properties of water are scarcely\r\nworth describing.  Elaine, however, was enormously reheartened, thus to\r\nhave Sidney there again, and know he had suffered no hurt.  She bade\r\nhim good-night when their meager repast was finished, with the bravest\r\ncheer that Grenville had taken to heart for many a weary day.  Then,\r\nwith the cord once more on her arm, she resumed her place by the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\nTHE HOUR OF CLIMAX\r\n\r\nGrenville made no attempt to sleep as the long night went laggardly by.\r\nHe dozed, from sheer weariness, now and again, with his back against\r\nthe rocks, but two or three times in every hour he rose from his place\r\nto go out on the ledge, where he listened to catch the slightest sound\r\nthat might be made above the ceaseless lapping of the water.  He would\r\nthen return to the gallery, assure himself the smoldering brands were\r\nready for use at any moment, and once more sit down to wait and nod.\r\n\r\nElaine was equally sleepless.  Far more than Grenville she feared night\r\ntreacheries on the part of the Dyaks from the jungle.  The state of her\r\nnerves, since the terrace was so readily accessible to the head-hunting\r\nbutchers, permitted no thought of sleep.  Moreover, never since their\r\narrival on the island had Grenville so far exiled himself from her side\r\nthroughout a night.  She had always felt protected heretofore, and upon\r\nthat protection had relied.\r\n\r\nAs restlessly as the man below she came to the door, times without\r\nnumber, to listen for sounds the jungle might surrender, as well as to\r\nwatch through the darkness for the slightest inimical sign.  Not a\r\nsound, however, did the night vouchsafe her straining senses; not the\r\nslightest movement in all the world of shadows, life, and tragedy about\r\nand below her position could her blazing eyes detect.\r\n\r\nShe had never known a night so long, or one so haunted with fears.  Her\r\nimagination played cruelly upon her heart, picturing one dread scene of\r\nbutchery after another, with Sidney completely overwhelmed and finally\r\nslain, while she, no longer desirous of life, awaited her fate in a\r\ndumb and dulled indifference.  She was certain the morning would never\r\ndawn again, or, if it did, the one man pitted against these savages\r\nmight not even have time for one faint tug on the cord about her arm,\r\nmore like a farewell than a signal.\r\n\r\nIt was a red and troubled break of day that finally reddened the\r\neastern sky, where clouds were banked above the sea.  Grenville had\r\ndozed for perhaps as much as twenty minutes.  He awoke with a start\r\nfrom lurid dreams in which he had fancied himself awake after\r\ncriminally oversleeping, only to find himself and Elaine pinned down by\r\na horde of the merciless brutes to whom human heads are trophies.\r\n\r\nThe red of the sky for a moment confirmed some remaining disorder of\r\nhis thoughts.  He had stumbled quickly to the cavern's mouth, from\r\nwhich the sanguinary streaks and blotches, now painting the far horizon\r\nand dully reflected in the sea, were confusedly presented.\r\n\r\nThe coolness of the haunting breeze, that crept like a presence about\r\nthe silent island, restored him soon and cleared the mists from his\r\nbrain.  He stood for several minutes, gazing listlessly forth,\r\ndisgusted with the outcome of the night.\r\n\r\nOnce more he returned to the gallery to inspect his brands of fire.\r\nAnd once again, on returning to the chamber, his inclination was to\r\nprop his back against the wall and let himself sink in slumber.\r\n\r\nThe dawn-light was slowly increasing.  He watched it dully for a moment\r\nmore, and yawned as he stumbled heavily towards the utter discomfort of\r\nhis resting-place.\r\n\r\nOnce more he adjusted his weary limbs upon the ledge, reflecting on\r\nwhat expedient he must now adopt, since this, his _coup-de-main_, had\r\nso egregiously failed.  He thought he was planning brilliantly when he\r\nonce more fell asleep.  The slightest of sounds that was foreign alike\r\nto tide or breeze now failed to arouse his senses as his head came\r\nforward on his breast.\r\n\r\nNot another sound was made where that one had strangely risen from the\r\nfront of the shattered ledge.  Even the sharpest eyes would have been\r\nfor a moment tricked by the shadows of the rocky niche, where the tide\r\nwas darkly swirling.  A fragment of the lower cliff then appeared to be\r\ndetached.\r\n\r\nIt was simply Grenville's catamaran, with two or three natives upon its\r\ndeck, silently maneuvering to land.  Back of it, just well off the\r\nfrowning headland wall, the bow of a larger Dyak craft appeared for the\r\nfraction of a minute.\r\n\r\nThe head-hunting fiends had arrived!  They had chosen the hour when\r\nexhaustion finally culminates and claims the helpless sentinel, heavily\r\ndreaming that all is well!\r\n\r\nAware that the slightest disturbance might warn their intended victims\r\nin the cave, the Dyaks labored with the utmost caution to fetch the\r\nfloat to the ledge.  This they presently accomplished, fending it off\r\nat a vital moment lest it scrape against the rock.\r\n\r\nTwo of the half-clad demons now landed, their movements as sinuous and\r\nsilent as a serpent's.  Instantly flattening down upon the tide-lapped\r\nshelf, while the third of their party skillfully guided the catamaran\r\nonce more to the larger craft without, they waited as patiently as the\r\nshadows, of which they seemed a part.\r\n\r\nThe plans of the crew on the boat without had been matured with much\r\nsagacity.  The transfer of two more men to the raft was quickly and\r\nnoiselessly accomplished, and once again the catamaran was permitted to\r\nswing on the tide's rotation into the open entrance of the inlet.\r\n\r\nThis second pair, with knives between their teeth and hands therefore\r\nunencumbered, were a trifle overeager to gain the mouth of the cave.\r\nOne of them caught at the fissured edge of tufa with avid fingers,\r\nwhile the float was responding to the force of the whirl.  His hold was\r\nrudely broken, yet so sharply had he dug in his nails that a fragment\r\nof rock was broken away.  It plumped with a gurgle in the water.\r\n\r\nGrenville was suddenly awakened--not so much by the sound the bit of\r\nrock had made as by something more subtle in the very air--a something\r\nonly to be interpreted by that instinct surviving from ages dark and\r\nold.\r\n\r\nHe was suddenly alive to a sense of imminent danger lurking fearfully\r\nclose at hand.  None too soon and none too silently he rose to his\r\nfeet, for there at the ledge the catamaran was halted and, even as the\r\ntwo impatient Dyaks landed, their companions came worming up the shelf.\r\n\r\nA moment more and all must have been too late, as Grenville clearly\r\nrealized.  Indeed, with the utmost caution only could retreat to his\r\ngallery be effected without a betrayal of his presence.  He dared not\r\nmove swiftly from his post--and yet he must be quick!\r\n\r\nSlowly and noiselessly withdrawing from his place beside the wall, he\r\ntook one long step inwards, towards the door he must place against the\r\nopen gallery entrance.\r\n\r\nThe dawn-light, redder and more intense, now cast an intangible shadow\r\nin the chamber as a Dyak's head appeared above the ledge.  The fiends\r\nwere all but on his heels!\r\n\r\nHe slipped within the passage, without creating the slightest sound,\r\nsave the loud, tumultuous pounding of his heart.  Lifting the door no\r\nless cautiously into its proper position, he left a crack, that was\r\nbarely a half-inch wide, through which to watch his visitors, writhing\r\nlike so many pythons over the shelf and into the ebon well of gloom.\r\n\r\nTheir plan was to crawl to the confines of the cave--unless they should\r\ncreep by chance upon their sleeping victims sooner, leaving a couple\r\ncrouched outside to prevent the quarry's escape.  Torches were not to\r\nbe lighted until every man was posted, and then would be thrown to the\r\ncenter of the cavern where their light would reveal the chamber's\r\noccupants, while the outer rim of darkness still concealed the gleaming\r\nknives.  A counter attack would be rendered out of the question.  The\r\ncordon would be complete.\r\n\r\nThree of those strangely-moving shadows Grenville plainly discerned.\r\nThere was nothing more to be seen--and nothing to be heard.  That\r\nseveral Dyaks were almost at his feet he felt, but could not have\r\nproved.  He had hoped for half a dozen at the least.  He hoped for them\r\nstill, and deliberately waited, trusting they might arrive.\r\n\r\nIt seemed such a pity to waste his mines and not obliterate the lot!\r\nHe wondered if more of them might not come--then how he should know, if\r\nthey did.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the three not included here in the cave-attacking party were\r\nequally active above.  The red of the dawn had seen them advancing\r\nthrough the jungle where they meant to take the hill and block the\r\nretreat of the victims to that eminence by any chance of extra ladders\r\nor white man's baffling magic.\r\n\r\nElaine beheld them, through the strengthening light, so soon as they\r\ncrossed the clearing.  They paused there as if for a signal, which they\r\nmay or may not have received.  It gave the girl, who had watched with\r\nan ever-increasing fever through the night and that blood-red dawn, a\r\nlong wild moment in which to imagine fates untold that must have\r\novertaken Sidney.\r\n\r\nShe was certain at last he was murdered in the cave, and that now, with\r\nthe passageway finally known, the fiends, whose passion was taking\r\nhuman life, had come to complete their tale of butchery and plunder.\r\nWhy else should they once more visit the hill at such an hour of the\r\nmorning?  They had barely waited for the dawn to make certain of their\r\nwork!\r\n\r\nShe saw them coming furtively up the trail, aware, she was sure, that\r\nby means of the hidden gallery their movements might be seen.  She had\r\nheld a wasting firebrand in her tense little fist for the past two\r\nhours.  And now--if only Sidney had told her what to do in such an\r\nextremity as this!  If only it might be her duty to fire the cannon!\r\n\r\nIt seemed as if she must obey the impulse--and perhaps save both of\r\ntheir lives!  The Dyaks were almost at the bridge.  They must soon come\r\nfairly in range of the gun!  After that--it would be too late!\r\n\r\nBelow, in the cavern, during this time, Grenville was haunted with\r\ndoubts.  He had waited in hopes other Dyaks would come, and not a sound\r\nhad rewarded his straining senses.  He began to fear he had waited too\r\nlong--that the creatures whose shadows had crept within had searched\r\nall the place and departed.\r\n\r\nYet he knew that they could not have passed him and left him unaware.\r\nThe light was now all in his favor, and steadily increasing.  With a\r\nsudden determination to take what toll the Fates had offered, he groped\r\nhis way back to his brands of fire, and then to the ends of his fuse.\r\n\r\nElaine, with her heart all but bursting, with excitement for which she\r\nhad no vent, saw the head-hunters pause on the slender bridge before\r\nthey crept upward as before.  Her weight was leaned against the door\r\ntill it moved a little from its bearings.\r\n\r\nShe was sure it had made some far-reaching sound that the Dyaks could\r\nnot fail to hear.  They had paused again--and again moved up the\r\ntrail--and found her helpless.  The cord on her arm!--if Sidney would\r\nonly pull the cord----\r\n\r\nThe sharp little tug that suddenly came now startled a cry from her\r\nlips.  Instantly thrusting away the door and bounding from the narrow\r\nledge to the upper level of the terrace, she ran towards the fuse with\r\nher cone of fire, just as Grenville, down in the gallery of rock, came\r\nmadly plunging upward.\r\n\r\nHe had lighted the fuse, and was groping towards the top, a fear that\r\nhe might be buried pursuing at his heels.  He stumbled across the heavy\r\nload of treasure, left in its basket by the wall.\r\n\r\nAs one in an earthquake or fire clutches up something to save it,\r\ninstinctively, so he laid hold of this useless dross and tugged it\r\nhotly up the passage.  He reached the upper angle thus before he\r\nrealized the folly of his action.  He was certain then, as he dropped\r\nthe load, that something had happened to his mines.\r\n\r\nBefore this time----\r\n\r\nWith the thought half finished in his swiftly-working brain came the\r\nthud and shock of his explosion--a tangible movement in the bulk of\r\nrock--and then the cataclysm.\r\n\r\nAlmost as one with Elaine's small detonation, the mighty jar, the\r\nair-confounding concussion, the smothered boom, and the dizzying tremor\r\nthat swayed the hill, shook down the girl's bewildered senses.  She saw\r\nthe red leap from the cannon's mouth--and saw three men, surprised to\r\ninaction on the deadly angle of the trail--then down she went, her mind\r\nconvinced she had rended the island asunder.\r\n\r\nSounds of colossal destruction stormed through the air for a time that\r\nseemed to have no end.  The roar of a cataract of broken stone,\r\nconfusedly toppling from estates erected by the ages, was lost in a\r\ntumult of other sounds where the headland seemed to fill the sea.\r\n\r\nDust of the rock and smoke of the rock ascended with fumes of the\r\npowder.  Tidal disturbances splashed and seethed where the sea, having\r\nsplit to receive those tons of chaos, surged back with augmented\r\nviolence at this displacement of its waters.\r\n\r\nThe cave had been blotted from existence!  Its walls and its ceiling\r\nhad crashed from their several places.  to leave only an ugly scar.\r\nWhole towers of rocks, cleaved from the hill's main mass in sudden\r\nviolence, had hung in disordered ruin against the quaking air for a\r\nsecond, then rioted downward on the Dyak boat to plunge it, rent and\r\nshivered, to the bottom.\r\n\r\nNot a man of that murderous group below had survived the climax of that\r\nsecond.  The place that had once been a treasure tomb, with a wailing\r\n\"spirit\" at its portals, was at last a very tomb indeed; but nevermore\r\nwould its tidal wail arise on the air to render the cavern sacred.\r\n\r\nLike a veritable spirit of underground destruction, Grenville emerged\r\nfrom the passage, unaware of all he had done.  His thought was only of\r\nElaine.  He called, as he climbed to the terrace, but no glad little\r\ncry made response.\r\n\r\nThen, abruptly, he saw her prostrate figure on the rocks--and beyond\r\nher two men, with one limberly inert, limping blindly down the trail.\r\nTo dart to his store, snatch the last of his bombs, and pursue these\r\nthree who had threatened Elaine was the first wild impulse of his\r\nbeing.  Just one such blow, to follow up his victory, and perhaps they\r\nshould need no more!\r\n\r\nBut he ran instead to the helpless figure near the cannon.  He knew\r\nwhat she had done.  He took her up swiftly, calling on her name, and\r\ncarried her back to the former cave, where a rosy light from the risen\r\nsun made it seem like a haven of promise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\nA LOTUS BLOSSOM\r\n\r\nIt was still very early in the morning when Grenville finally\r\ndiscovered, afar out northward on the sea, two Dyak boats making\r\nswiftly away from the island.\r\n\r\nHe feared for a moment, when the sails were first discerned, they were\r\nnew craft about to arrive.  He could not have known that his mines sunk\r\nthe third of the boats formerly at anchor in the inlet, and was in no\r\nway enabled to determine how many of the enemy had perished at the cave.\r\n\r\nIt was almost too much to credit, this apparent retreat of the fiends\r\nso bent upon his capture.  He made no positive report to Elaine of the\r\nfact he felt he must verify, lest he find himself obliged to retract it\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nShe had quickly responded to his ministrations, having fainted as much\r\nfrom lack of food and rest as from shock in that final moment.\r\nConcerning the final effect of her shot, she was destined never to\r\nknow.  Grenville was far too wise to let her believe she had taken the\r\nlife even of a fiend in human semblance.\r\n\r\nHe told her the Dyaks had fled from the place, which flight he had\r\npersonally witnessed.  He was certain, moreover, they would hardly\r\nreturn again that day, if they did not quit the island.  Assured of the\r\nsafety of the adventure, he descended to the jungle and returned with\r\nan armful of fruit.  He proceeded later to the spring for a fresh\r\nsupply of water.\r\n\r\nEstimating the final fighting force of the Dyaks at ten, and conceding\r\nthat five, at the least, must have perished at the cave, since one or\r\ntwo must have guarded the boats while three were searching the chamber,\r\nhe concluded that no more than four at the most could still remain\r\nuninjured.\r\n\r\nHe had gone to the edge of the ruin, above the obliterated cave, and,\r\nhaving discovered no boat either near or far, had arrived at a fairly\r\naccurate conjecture respecting the fate of the craft the Dyaks had\r\nemployed.  One more calculation, respecting the number of able seamen\r\nrequired to navigate the retreating vessels, convinced him the island\r\nwas deserted to the uses of Elaine and himself.\r\n\r\nIt was not, however, till that afternoon that he cautiously explored\r\ntheir former possessions and confirmed the hope in his breast.  There\r\nwas ample evidence about the spring, and in the jungle, of the methods\r\nof living the Dyaks had employed, but neither at the western inlet,\r\nback of the central hill of rock, nor at the friendly estuary, was\r\nanything boatlike to be found.  His catamaran had vanished, along with\r\nthe larger craft, and its fate he could readily surmise.\r\n\r\nHe lost no time in arranging a number of his snares and traps for the\r\nmeat of which they were in need.  Their camp was made as before on the\r\nterrace proper, despite the heat of the sun.\r\n\r\nIt was not until many of these essential comforts had been once more\r\nestablished that Sidney explored the gallery to determine what\r\ndestruction had been wrought by his double mine.\r\n\r\nEverything stored in the lower depths had been hopelessly buried by the\r\nrock.  The passage was open for no more than half its former length.\r\nHis bamboo raft was among the possessions sacrificed to the ruse that\r\nhad finally succeeded beyond even his wildest dreams.  Not ten feet\r\nback of his basket-load of treasure the last of the caving had been\r\nhalted.\r\n\r\nWhen Elaine's robe and couch, their water-jugs, and his last remaining\r\nbomb had been once more returned to the earlier camp, practically\r\nnothing but the gold and precious stones remained in the gallery.\r\nElaine was aware the trinkets were lying there on view, but so vast was\r\nher relief at the vanishment of danger--though it might be temporarily\r\nonly--she had no desire for gauds and baubles, and no particular\r\ncuriosity respecting their worth or appearance.\r\n\r\nIndeed, these two had endured too much to dwell upon jewels and gold.\r\nThey were free from menace for a time, but--the future still loomed\r\nbefore them, inimical and obscure.  Their life in this tropic exile was\r\nstill to be faced, day after day.\r\n\r\nThat morning and long sweet afternoon, however, they passed in restful\r\ninactivity, possessed by ineffable thankfulness and a sense of relief\r\nthat was utterly relaxing to their racked and exhausted nerves.  It\r\nseemed a strange, impossible state, this peacefulness, security, and\r\nfreedom to move about once more, alone in their Shalimar.  And\r\nGrenville knew it was far too good to last.\r\n\r\nYet for several days it seemed as if the propitiating Fates made every\r\npossible endeavor to erase from the tablets of their memory all records\r\nof the agonies and apprehensions they had recently undergone.\r\n\r\nThey were wonderful days, for sheer inspiriting beauty.  A cool, spicy\r\nbreeze was wafted, with the sunshine, across the smiling ocean.  The\r\njungle was redolent of fragrances of intoxicating sweetness.  Down on\r\nthe beach her leafy bower once more found Elaine idly resting in her\r\nhammock, or busily preparing a tempting repast from the once more\r\ngenerous larder.\r\n\r\nThe girdle of gold she continued to wear in happiness that stole\r\nunbidden to her heart--a happiness as subtle and welcome as the\r\nperfumes that stole to her senses on the breeze.  And when she finally\r\nfound and plucked a solitary lotus blossom, floating near the estuary's\r\nedge, it seemed as if the ecstasy possessing all her nature must bring\r\nabout some miracle of untold joy and bliss.\r\n\r\nGrenville was hardly less transported by the hourly pleasures that day\r\nand night alike seemed bearing to this island world, like argosies from\r\nEden.  Subconsciously, beneath it all, he knew the boats that had\r\nsailed away would one day return, perhaps with more of their species,\r\nand better prepared for a swift and merciless revenge.  Yet even then\r\nhe was slow to employ his wits and energies to prepare for another\r\nsiege, his disinclination for more revolting ordeals casting a lethargy\r\non all his fighting attributes, while days like these, voluptuously\r\nserene and toxicant, suggested vast contentment to his spirit.\r\n\r\nIndeed, his spirit as well as his body needed rest.  To this he was\r\nconstantly urged by Elaine, who understood, far better than himself,\r\nhow unsparingly he had drained the vital essences of his being through\r\nall these uncounted weeks.\r\n\r\nShe, too, was aware they were only secure for a moment, that untold\r\ndangers must be lurking just beyond the rim of their purple horizon.\r\nShe had finally learned from Sidney's lips how the vessels had sailed\r\naway.  She had, however, seen this sign of security previously\r\nfail--and felt it would fail again.\r\n\r\nThe future her soul avoided.  Darkness and tragedy were only too\r\nreadily imagined.  At best it was all uncertain, rife with shadows,\r\npeopled with ghosts of doubt and haunting dreads.  Meantime, their own\r\ngreen Shalimar was once more fresh with sunny smiles that enticed her\r\nspirit to song.\r\n\r\nShe sang to herself through many hours of joyous \"household\" duties.\r\nThe songs she chose were happy little fragments wherein she imagined\r\nGrenville set, with herself always traipsing at his side.  She sang her\r\nsongs to and of him, watching him shyly when he was near, and sending\r\nher thoughts to seek him out when he hunted or wandered in the jungle.\r\n\r\nIt was not until one of those incomparable mornings, with the tropic\r\ngreenery fresh as a breath over clover, that he finally heard the notes\r\nshe had prisoned in her bosom break forth in clear, sweet utterance, as\r\ncrystal bright as the sun.\r\n\r\nHe paused in the screen of ferns and palms to partake of her wild,\r\nsweet rapture.  And how lightly and gladly she sang!\r\n\r\n  \"_Come out, come out, my dearest dear,\r\n    Come out and greet the sun!\r\n  The birds awake on tree and brake,\r\n    The merry May's begun!_\r\n\r\n  \"_Come out and drink the diamond dew,\r\n    Come out and tread the lea!\r\n  The world is all awake, and you\r\n    Are all the world to me!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that was starved in his nature stirred in response to the song.\r\nHis blood leaped faster, its glow like that of rich and\r\nsense-delighting wine.  A vivid memory of the one lawless kiss he had\r\ndared to snatch from Elaine's red lips inflamed a sweet desire.\r\n\r\nHe had called her his sweetheart, called her his mate, for the frenzy\r\nof joy, the ecstasy, her nature had wrought upon his own.  He felt\r\nto-day his claim had been proved, by their life alone with God.  They\r\nhad worked and fought and planned the days away together, like a mated\r\npair fresh created and cast to an Eden of the sea.  They belonged to\r\none another.\r\n\r\nLove had come at last to Elaine--a love to match the strength and\r\npurpose of his own--a love overwhelming, natural, unabashed--was their\r\nrightful heritage.  Its holiness gave it sanction; its rightness made\r\nit as pure as fire that makes hard metal molten.\r\n\r\nHe started slowly towards the hill whereon Elaine was busied.  He\r\nhalted, however, hidden from view by a new banana foliage, wondrously\r\nunrolling.  Another song was floating on the air.\r\n\r\n  \"_Pale hands I loved, upon the Shalimar,\r\n    Where are you now?  Who lies beneath thy spell?\r\n  Whom do you lead on rapture's roadway jar\r\n    Before you agonize them, in farewell?_\r\n\r\n  \"_Pale hands I loved, upon the Shalimar,\r\n    Where are you now?  Where are you now?_\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe mad intoxication of his senses rocked him strangely, there in the\r\nthicket.  He saw the gleam of the jeweled girdle that spanned Elaine's\r\nlithe figure, as she moved about on the brink of the terrace above.\r\nOnce again his heart struck mightily against its walls, as it had the\r\nfirst day she had worn this gold, by way of a maid's confession.\r\n\r\nHe knew at last her Shalimar was a wild little garden of love, to be\r\nsacredly shared between them.  Excited to trembling he started again to\r\njoin her at the cavern.  Before he could come to the foot of the trail\r\nshe suddenly ran to the terrace-edge, looking down like a vision of\r\ndespair.\r\n\r\n\"Sidney!\" she cried, \"another Dyak boat!  I've just this minute seen\r\nthe sail!\"\r\n\r\nReady to curse the merciless Fates, as well as his own recent laziness,\r\nwhich had made calamity possible, Grenville ran swiftly up the mended\r\ntrail and followed Elaine to the tree.\r\n\r\nThe sail was certainly plain enough to see, far out in the purple\r\nwaters.  It was, to all appearances, bearing directly down upon the\r\nisland.  But, as Grenville watched, it altered shape.  His face showed\r\na sign of relaxing.\r\n\r\n\"I don't believe it's a Dyak craft,\" he told her, hoarsely.  \"It looks\r\nlike----  I think it's a yacht.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\nTHE LAST BOMB\r\n\r\nIt certainly was a modern yacht that the two of them saw, straining\r\ntheir eyes to identify the stranger roving afar in their waters.\r\n\r\nA trick of the sun, or perhaps her paint, had concealed both masts and\r\nfunnel for a time, presenting only a rakish angle of her prow and\r\nquarter, incredibly like a sail of the shape the Dyaks employ.\r\n\r\nBut, if eager excitement surged uninterruptedly through the pulses of\r\nthe two ragged exiles, there on the barren headland, the bitterness of\r\nvain disappointments promptly began their inroads to its centers.  The\r\nyacht was not only in great apparent haste, but was heading far off to\r\nthe eastward, with not the slightest curiosity respecting the tiny\r\nisland of whom no one could give a good report.\r\n\r\nThe flagpole was gone--and a new one had been neglected.  There was no\r\ntime now to erect another, as Grenville realized.  He stood with Elaine\r\non the brink of the rock, frantically waving his arms and cap, and even\r\na large banana leaf, while the slender distant visitor came abreast\r\nthem and continued straight ahead.\r\n\r\n\"They've got to see!  They've got to!\" he cried, in the desperate\r\nplight of mind begotten by this promise thus mercilessly snatched away.\r\n\r\nSuddenly abandoning all other possible devices, he ran to his powder\r\n\"magazine,\" where the last of the bombs was stored.  He came with it\r\nhugged against his breast, in thoughtless and dangerous proximity to\r\nthe firebrand clutched in his fist.\r\n\r\n\"Run back!\" he said.  \"I haven't time to make it thoroughly safe!\"\r\n\r\nBut Elaine remained to see him lower it down on the broken rocks, where\r\nthe cave had formerly existed.  She waited, indeed, till he lighted the\r\nfuse and drew her away towards the shelter.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were on the distant yacht, fast fading once more from their\r\nvision.  The bomb must have failed.  The fuse was deficient, he was\r\nsure.  He started back to recover the thing and make it certain of\r\nexplosion.\r\n\r\nThen it burst, and flung shattered fragments along all the face of the\r\nwall.\r\n\r\nGrenville was watching the distant yacht with fixed, almost frenzied,\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\n\"They haven't heard!\" he groaned, despairingly.  \"They're going faster\r\nthan before!\"\r\n\r\nIt certainly seemed as if the hurried stranger would no more halt than\r\nwould a fiery meteor overdue at some cosmic appointment.\r\n\r\nThen of a sudden, from its bow, broke a pure-white cloud of smoke.  She\r\nhad answered with the small brass piece employed to fire a salute.  Her\r\nprow was turned before the sound came dully across the waters.  Sobbing\r\nand laughing together, in sudden relief, Elaine sank down on her knees,\r\namong the bowlders, to watch this deliverance come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\nA GIFT REFUSED\r\n\r\nThe yacht was the \"Petrel,\" luxurious hobby of Sir Myles Kemp, diverted\r\nfrom her homeward course by the merest whim of her owner to run up\r\nnorthward for a day while Sir Myles should inspect the rubber\r\nplantation and estate of his old fellow-officer, Captain Williams, who\r\nwas not even present at the place.\r\n\r\nThe inspection was never made.  The utter amazement occasioned by the\r\nchance discovery of the exiles of Three-Hill Island, plus their story\r\nof its fateful occupation, completely overshadowed all else in the\r\nminds of the \"Petrel's\" commander and crew, whose one idea was to\r\nassist the castaways home with the greatest speed of which steel and\r\nsteam were capable.  The picture the pair presented as they came\r\naboard--Elaine amazingly tattered, a supple, tanned, incredibly sweet\r\nand womanly little figure--Grenville, a bearded, active master of the\r\nwild, clad in the skin of a cheeta for a coat, and bearing a richly\r\ncolored tiger-skin, rolled up to contain a hundredweight of\r\ntreasure--was one that Sir Myles was destined never to forget.  He was\r\nlikewise always destined to misunderstand the emotions with which, as\r\nthey steamed away at last, Elaine looked back, with tears in her eyes,\r\nat the unpeopled Isle of Shalimar, so green in its purple setting,\r\npresenting its headland to the sea with that lone tree reared above its\r\nsummit.\r\n\r\nGrenville, too, had seen her eyes--and he more nearly comprehended.\r\n\r\nBy great good-fortune much of Lady Kemp's wardrobe had been left aboard\r\nthe yacht.  She and Elaine must have been of a size, to judge from the\r\nmanner in which her yachting apparel and her dainty boudoir adjusted\r\nthemselves to the form of the girl whom Sir Myles began forthwith to\r\ntreat as he might a daughter.\r\n\r\nThe \"Petrel\" was put about and headed for Colombo--the nearest port at\r\nwhich an Orient steamer would be likely to be encountered.  It was not\r\nuntil after dinner had been served and his guests had been made as\r\nthoroughly comfortable as warm-hearted hospitality, admiration for the\r\ntwo of them, and exceptional thoughtfulness could compass that Sir\r\nMyles related the accepted fate of the \"Inca,\" from the wreck of which\r\nthey escaped.\r\n\r\nThe news had gone forth that she foundered, and not a soul was saved.\r\nA few insignificant pieces of wreckage had been found afloat, far from\r\nthe unknown ledge of rock the earthquake had lifted in the sea, but no\r\none till now had heard so much as a theory as to what had been her fate.\r\n\r\nThat some such intelligence must have been sent to the worried and\r\nwaiting relatives and friends beyond the seas, both Grenville and\r\nElaine had long before comprehended, despite the preoccupation\r\nengrossing their minds all these many age-long weeks.  But now, when at\r\nlength they were homeward bound, the facts presented an aspect which\r\nthere had been no occasion to prepare against while struggling for\r\nexistence on the island.\r\n\r\nThere was one thought only in their minds.  It was Fenton, and what he\r\nmight have done when that news had expended its shock.  And what would\r\nbe the outcome of the story, now that the home-coming journey was\r\nresumed--now that he, Sidney Grenville, could at last complete and\r\ndischarge his original commission?\r\n\r\nHe faced the business hardly more calmly than did Elaine.  No argument\r\npossible to him now, respecting the warning Fenton had received,\r\navailed to allay and satisfy his haunting sense of honor.  The man had\r\nmatured on Shalimar, and his soul had been refined.\r\n\r\nBut what strange days those were that now succeeded!  How they robbed\r\nhim of his happiness, as they brought him nearer home!  His spirits\r\nsank and would not rise, the nearer Colombo was approached.  He told\r\nhimself then, once he could wire, acquaint Gerald Fenton with the fact\r\nthey were safe, and would soon be with him, he would come to some peace\r\nof mind.\r\n\r\nBut, when at length the wire was sent, he experienced no such relief.\r\nRelief, indeed, had failed to come when for three days and nights the\r\nOrient boat had been plowing across the Indian Ocean, rushing headlong\r\nfrom the tropic heat to the distant ports beyond.\r\n\r\nHe thought, perhaps, if he informed Elaine, the business would be\r\nsettled.  He attempted that day to introduce the subject, but in vain.\r\nElaine was so sparklingly happy!  He postponed the ordeal for the night.\r\n\r\nThe moon had returned to the skies again, bringing to the wanderers\r\nineffable memories of other nights, when peace lay tranquilly fragrant\r\non the world of their Shalimar.  He detected its subtle influence on\r\nthe ever-vivacious little woman who had shared his perils and his joys.\r\n\r\nElaine was softly thrilling to the spell of it all as she halted beside\r\nhim, finally, on a strip of the deck abandoned to their uses.  She felt\r\nthat the atmosphere was overcharged, and wondered what might be\r\nimpending.  To still the pounding of her heart she leaned on the\r\ntaffrail, ecstatically in touch with Grenville's arm.  She spoke of the\r\nwonder of the night.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" drawled Grenville, in his old dry way, \"great facilities here\r\nfor manufacturing nights----  I wired Gerald from Colombo.\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment Elaine was puzzled by this wholly irrelevant remark.  Then\r\nher heart began to rock uneasily.\r\n\r\n\"You--wired we were coming home?\"\r\n\r\n\"Wired I was fetching you home, after unavoidable delay.\"\r\n\r\nShe recognized the difference between the way that she and he had\r\nexpressed the principal fact.  She felt herself, as it were, already\r\nsurrendered to a man grown singularly foreign to her nature.  It seemed\r\nto her incredible that Sidney and she should ever again be parted, or\r\nwork out their several destinies in any manner save\r\ntogether--especially after all he had said and even done.\r\n\r\n\"Was that--all you said?\" she asked him, faintly.\r\n\r\n\"No.  I said I'd be best man--or something of the sort.\"\r\n\r\nElaine felt something leaden go down to the point of her heart.\r\n\r\n\"You wanted him to know that you had no idea----  You wanted Gerald to\r\nunderstand----\"  She could not finish her sentence.  Her face was hotly\r\nflaming, but at least she could turn it away.\r\n\r\nGrenville's voice was hard and strange.\r\n\r\n\"It was barely his right to know that we were coming.  I could do no\r\nless, as you'll certainly agree.\"\r\n\r\nHis speeches were constrained, unnatural, as Elaine had instantly felt.\r\nHer own were scarcely less embarrassed--after all these months when\r\ntheir entire world had comprised themselves alone.  It seemed a\r\nmonstrous error that anything but free, unfettered companionship and\r\ncandor should exist between them now.\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" she said.  \"Of course.\"  She added, after a moment, \"It seems\r\nso peculiar, that's all--to--resume as we were before.\"\r\n\r\nHe was looking at his fist, for no good reason in the world.\r\n\r\n\"It is what you have hoped for every day.\"\r\n\r\n\"To get away from the Dyaks--why, of course.\"\r\n\r\nAnother silence supervened.  After three unsuccessful efforts at\r\nspeech, Elaine at last found the voice and the courage for a question:\r\n\r\n\"Do you wish to be--best man?\"\r\n\r\nGrenville spread out his fingers, for further inspection.\r\n\r\n\"I probably shouldn't have suggested it otherwise.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned upon him impulsively.  \"Sidney, are you absolutely honest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I wouldn't trouble old Diogenes to get out of his grave and look\r\nme up,\" he answered, in his customary spirit, \"but I've got a faint\r\nidea what honor means.\"\r\n\r\nHow well she knew his various manners of evasion!  Her heart was\r\npounding furiously.  She leaned with all her weight against the rail,\r\nas if for fear he must hear its clamorous confessions.\r\n\r\nShe had never been so excited in her life--or more courageous.\r\nLikewise she felt she possessed certain God-given rights that were\r\npoised at the brink of disaster.  For a love like hers comes never\r\nlightly and is not to be lightly dismissed.  Her utterance was\r\ndifficult, but mastered.\r\n\r\n\"One night--in the smoke--on the island--when we might have died of\r\nthirst--and you came with water----  You remember what you said?\"\r\n\r\n\"Concerning what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Concerning--love.\"\r\n\r\nHe was gripping a stanchion fiercely; his fingers were white with the\r\nstrain.\r\n\r\n\"Vaguely----  I think I was exhausted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! you're not--you're not honest at all!\" she suddenly exploded.\r\n\"That day of the wreck--on the steamer--you know what you said to me\r\nthen!  And any man who has acted so nobly, so thoughtfully----\"\r\n\r\nHe turned and gripped the small, soft hand by his coat-sleeve on the\r\nrail.\r\n\r\n\"Don't do it, little woman--don't do it!\" he said, in a low voice,\r\ncharged with passion.  \"You told me some stinging truths that day, and\r\nnow--they're truer than ever!\"\r\n\r\n\"I didn't!\" she said, no longer master of her feelings.  \"I didn't tell\r\nthe truth!  I said I hated--said I loathed----  And you _said_ I'd\r\nthrow his ring in the sea--and you said you'd make me--like\r\nyou--some--and you know that I couldn't help liking you now--when\r\nyou've treated me so horribly all the time!  And after everything we've\r\ndone together----\"\r\n\r\n\"Elaine!\" he interrupted, hoarsely, \"when did you throw away his ring?\"\r\n\r\n\"After the tiger--the night I gave you the cap, and you acted so\r\nhatefully and mean!  It bounced and went into the water.\"\r\n\r\nHe was white, and tremendously shaken, while gleams of incandescence\r\nburned deeply in his eyes.  How he stayed the lawless impulse to take\r\nher to his arms he never knew.  He dropped her hand and turned away,\r\nwith a savage note of pain upon his lips.\r\n\r\n\"Good Heavens!\" he said, \"why don't you help me a little?  I had no\r\nright then!  I have no right now! ... I'm going to take you home to\r\nFenton, if it's the very last act of my life!\"\r\n\r\nShe, too, was white and trembling.\r\n\r\n\"I know what you mean--you _never_ loved!  You don't know the meaning\r\nof the word!\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" he said.  \"We'll let it go at that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you're perfectly horrid!\" she suddenly cried, the hot tears\r\nspringing to her eyes.  \"I refuse to be taken back to Gerald!  I refuse\r\nto have anything more to do with any selfish man in the world!\"\r\n\r\nShe retreated a little towards the saloon, her two hands going swiftly\r\nto a gleaming band that all but spanned her waist.\r\n\r\n\"And there's your old girdle, with Gerald's ring, that you made me\r\nthrow away!\" she added, flinging the tiger's collar towards the sea.\r\n\r\nIt struck on a stanchion, bounded to the deck, and settled against a\r\nnear-by chair.  She waited a second, instantly ashamed, and longing to\r\nbeg his forgiveness.  But he leaned as before against the rail, his\r\neyes still bent upon the water.\r\n\r\nWeakly, with drooping spirits, Elaine retreated through an open door,\r\nstill watching, in hopes he would turn and call her back.  Then,\r\nstoutly suppressing her choking and pent emotions, she fled to the\r\ndismal comfort of her stateroom, and, falling face downward in her\r\nnarrow berth, surrendered to the vast relief of sobbing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\nA FRIEND IN NEED\r\n\r\nThat one more shock of surprise could overtake the returning castaways\r\nbefore the final landing could be accomplished would have seemed\r\nincredible to either Grenville or Elaine--and yet it came.\r\n\r\nThey had spent a number of wretched days--days far more miserable and\r\nhope-destroying than any their dire experience had brought into being,\r\nas the mere result of that final scene enacted in the moonlight by the\r\nrail.\r\n\r\nThe steamer had touched in the night at some unimportant, outlying port\r\nof call to which no one had paid the tribute of interest usual on the\r\nsea.  A single male passenger had boarded.\r\n\r\nThe man was Gerald Fenton.  The message dispatched from Colombo had\r\nfetched him, post haste, to this midway ground for the meeting.  But\r\nthe meeting occurred in a manner wholly unexpected.\r\n\r\nLike the wholly considerate gentleman he was, Fenton had made all\r\npreparations for removing the startling elements from the fact of his\r\npresence on the boat.  Like so many of life's little schemings,\r\nhowever, the plans went all \"aglee.\"\r\n\r\nElaine not only did not linger in her stateroom in the morning late\r\nenough to receive his note from the stewardess, but, when she hastened\r\nup to the topmost deck for her early morning exercise before the more\r\nlazy should appear, she literally ran into Fenton's arms at the head of\r\nthe narrow stairs.\r\n\r\nHer surprise could hardly have been greater.  She recoiled from the\r\ncontact automatically, before she had time to see who it was with whom\r\nshe had collided.  Then a note of astonishment broke from her lips as\r\nshe halted, leadenly.\r\n\r\n\"Why--Gerald!\" she managed to stammer, without the slightest hint of\r\ngladness in her tone.  \"Here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, little girl!\" he answered, smilingly; and, coming to her in his\r\nquiet way, he took her hands to greet her with a kiss.\r\n\r\nA note of uncertainty forced itself to audible expression as she\r\nslightly retreated from his proffered caress and received it on her\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\n\"Well! well!\" Fenton continued, \"you're certainly fit--and brown!  You\r\ncouldn't have had the note I sent to break the news.  I tried to give\r\nyou warning.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said, constrainedly, \"I've had no word.  How did you get\r\nhere--come aboard?  I don't see how----  It took me so by surprise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said, his smile losing something of its brightness.  \"I\r\nboarded at midnight, when the steamer touched at Fargo.  When I got\r\nSid's wholly incredible wire that you were both safe and well and\r\ncoming home----  But how is the good old rascal?\"\r\n\r\nElaine's constraint increased.\r\n\r\n\"Quite well, I believe--as far as I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't he with you, here on the boat, going home?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes, he's on the steamer.\"\r\n\r\nFenton was groping, without a woman's intuitions, through the something\r\nhe felt in the air.\r\n\r\n\"Don't you like him, Elaine?\" he asked her, bluntly.  \"What's wrong?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--nothing's wrong,\" she answered, unconvincingly.  \"It's just the\r\nsurprise of meeting you like this.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" he said, as he had before, his eyes now entirely\r\nsmileless.  \"I might have managed it better, I suppose----  Aren't you\r\na little bit glad to see me?\"\r\n\r\nElaine attempted a smile and a manner more cordial.  \"Of course--I'm\r\ndelighted!  But it takes me just a minute or so to realize it's really\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind.  Take your time,\" he told her, indulgently.  \"Perfect\r\nmiracle, you know, that you and old Sid should have come through the\r\nwreck of the 'Inca'--the sole survivors of the accident--and lived out\r\nthere--somewhere--on an island, I hear--and now be nearing home.  I'm\r\neager to hear the story.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she agreed, \"it doesn't seem real to me, now.  It's more like a\r\nlong, strange dream.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have only heard a little from the captain,\" he continued, forcing a\r\nconversation which he felt was wholly unspontaneous and hardly even\r\ncongenial.\r\n\r\n\"Naturally, all his information----\"\r\n\r\nShe saw his eyes quickly brighten as his gaze went past her to the\r\nstairs.\r\n\r\n\"Sid!\" he cried, moving swiftly forward; and Grenville appeared on the\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\nHis face was suddenly reddened, beneath the veneer of tan.  But the\r\nboyish joy with which he rushed for Fenton was a heartening thing to\r\nsee.\r\n\r\nThe two simply gripped, with might and main, and hammered each other\r\nwith one free hand apiece, and laughed, and called one another\r\nastonishing names till it seemed they might explode.\r\n\r\n\"You savage!  You tough old Redskin!\" Fenton finally managed to\r\narticulate, distinctly.  \"If it isn't yourself as big as life!  And I\r\nwant you to know I haven't made your fortune--not exactly--yet--but\r\nit's certain at last.  And how about your winning my little girl?\r\nSpeak up, you caveman of the----  Oh, Elaine!\"\r\n\r\nBut Elaine had fled the scene.\r\n\r\nThat moment began the tug at the ties of friendship and the test of the\r\nsouls of the three.  It was not a time of happiness that thereupon\r\nensued.  Elaine avoided both the men as far as possible.  Grenville\r\nalone seemed natural, and yet even his smiles were tinged with the\r\nartificial.\r\n\r\nHe was glad to relate their varied adventures--the tale of the perils\r\nthrough which they had finally won.  But how much of it all Gerald\r\nFenton really heard no man could with certainty tell.\r\n\r\nFenton was neither a self-conceited person nor a blind man, groping\r\nthrough life.  Through the stem of his finely colored calabash he\r\npuffed many a thought, along with his fragrant tobacco fume, and\r\nrevolved it in his brain.\r\n\r\nBetween certain lines of Grenville's story he read deep happenings.\r\nThat Sidney had saved and preserved Elaine, and battled for her comfort\r\nand her very life, against all but overwhelming odds, was a fact that\r\nrequired no rehearsal.\r\n\r\nMere propinquity, as Fenton knew, has always been the match-maker\r\nincomparable, throughout the habited world.  Add to the quite\r\nexceptional propinquity of a tropic-island existence a splendid and\r\nunfaltering heroism in Grenville, together with a mastery of every\r\nsituation, months of daily service and devotion, and the rare good\r\nlooks that Sidney had certainly developed--and what wonder Elaine\r\nshould be changed?\r\n\r\nThe change in her bearing had struck him at once at the moment of their\r\nmeeting by the stairs.  He had never got past that since.  When at\r\nlength his course was clearly defined and his resolution firmly fixed,\r\nit still required skillful maneuvering on Fenton's part to manage the\r\none little climax on which he finally determined.\r\n\r\nBut night, with her shadows, her softening moods, and her veiling ways\r\nof comfort, was an ally worthy of his trust.  When he finally\r\nengineered the unsuspicious Grenville to the upper deck, where Elaine\r\nhad already been enticed, evasion of the issue was done.\r\n\r\n\"It's amazing,\" said Fenton, in a pleasant, easy manner, \"how I am\r\nbecoming the talker of the crowd, when both you fond adventurers should\r\nbe spilling out lectures by the mile.  However, such is life.\"  He\r\npaused for a moment, but the others did not speak.\r\n\r\n\"The genuine wonder of it all,\" he presently continued, \"is seeing you\r\nboth come back thus, safe and sound.  I underwent my bit of grief when\r\nthe news of the monstrous disaster finally arrived, as, of course, did\r\nmany another.  I thought I had lost the dearest friend and the--well,\r\nthe dearest two friends--the dearest two beings in the world to me, in\r\none huge cataclysm.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused once more and relighted his pipe.  The flame of his match\r\nthrew a rosy glow on the two set faces on either side of his position,\r\nas well as on his own.  No one looked at anyone else, and the two still\r\nfailed to answer.\r\n\r\n\"Well--here you both are!\" the smoker resumed, crushing the match and\r\nthrowing it away.  \"If I were to lose your love and friendship now----\r\nBut never mind that--I sha'n't!  You were dead to me, both of you, all\r\nthose months, and mourned rather poignantly.  That's the point I want\r\nyou both to understand--that I had accepted the fact of losing you\r\nboth, forever.\"\r\n\r\nGrenville slightly stirred, but did not speak.  Elaine was clasping her\r\nhands in her lap and locking her fingers till they ached.\r\n\r\n\"Naturally,\" Fenton told them, quietly, \"I conformed my thoughts to\r\nyour demise, at last, as we all must do in actual cases.  I adjusted my\r\nheart-strings, when I could, anew.  Nobody else came into my life, to\r\noccupy your places, for nobody could.  Yet I did adjust things as I've\r\nsaid.  Well--now that brings us up to the point.\"\r\n\r\nGrenville sank back against his seat, but restlessly leaned forward as\r\nbefore.  Elaine alone remained absolutely motionless, rigid with\r\nattention, if not also with suppressed excitement at something she felt\r\nimpending.  Fenton thumbed at the glowing tobacco in his pipe.\r\n\r\n\"It appears to me,\" he continued, \"all the circumstances I have\r\nmentioned being taken into consideration, that you two friends that I\r\nlove so well have so many times saved one another's lives that no one\r\nliving has the slightest right to think or to act as might have been\r\nthe case if you had not passed so entirely from his ken, and his plans,\r\nand daily existence.  His claims to your resurrected selves\r\nare--different, let us say, or secondary.\"\r\n\r\nThe silence that fell for a moment became acutely painful.\r\n\r\n\"That's all I'm really driving at, after all my long and labored\r\npreamble,\" Fenton concluded, deliberately rising and facing about to\r\nconfront the pair on the bench.  \"I recognize certain inevitable\r\nthings--and I know they're right--and the way the Almighty intended....\r\nDon't let me lose my friends again....  Let's all be sensible....  I\r\ndon't ask or expect to be loved the way you love one another--but I'd\r\nlike to be old Gerald to you both.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned and went slowly down the narrow stairs, and his pipe trailed\r\na spark behind him.\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nAfter a time, when Grenville moved over and placed his arm about\r\nElaine, she struggled for a moment, feebly.\r\n\r\n\"I don't--I don't love you in the least!\" she protested.  \"I hate\r\nyou--as I always have--and the way I always shall!\"\r\n\r\nHer arms went swiftly about his neck, however, in a passionate, fierce\r\nlittle hug.  She was laughing and crying together.\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Grenville, calmly.  \"That's the kind of hate I want.\"\r\n\r\nHe kissed her once on her upturned lips for every hour they had\r\nsuffered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END",
