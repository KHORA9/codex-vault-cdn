G. ELLIOTT, DRAINAGE ENGINEER.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nThe practical advantage of drainage as it appears to the casual observer,\r\nis in the increased production of valuable crops. Ordinary land is\r\nimproved, and worthless land so far reclaimed as to yield a profit to its\r\nowner, where once it was a source of loss and a blemish upon an otherwise\r\nfair district. The land-buyer who looks for a future rise in his purchase,\r\nrecognizes the value of drainage, being careful to invest his capital in\r\nland which has natural drainage, or is capable of being drained\r\nartificially with no great expense, if it is suitable for use as an\r\nagricultural domain. The physician, though perhaps unwilling, is obliged\r\nto admit drainage as an important agency in the reduction of malignant\r\ndiseases and much general ill-health among dwellers in both country and\r\nvillage. Our State Board of Health recognizes the influence of land\r\ndrainage upon the healthfulness of districts where it is practiced. The\r\nSecretary of this Board gives it as his opinion that even good road\r\ndrainage would diminish the number of preventable diseases 25 per cent.\r\n\r\nSuch are now some of the impressions as to the value of drainage among\r\nthose who judge from acknowledged effects. That a great change has been\r\nbrought about by this practice is apparent to the most superficial\r\nobserver, if he compares pre-drainage with the present.\r\n\r\n\r\nA FEW FACTS.\r\n\r\nThe Indiana Bureau of Statistics made an investigation about two years ago\r\nof the influence of tile drainage upon production and health in that\r\nState. Two periods of five years were selected, one before drainage was\r\nbegun, and the other after most of the farms had been drained, the area\r\nexamined being one township in Johnson county.\r\n\r\nAs near as could be determined, the average yearly yield of wheat for a\r\nperiod of five consecutive years before drainage was nine and a half\r\nbushels per acre. The same land and tillage after drainage in a period of\r\nfive consecutive years produced an average of nineteen and one-fourth\r\nbushels per acre. Comparing the corn crops in the same way for the same\r\ntime, it was found that the average yearly yield before drainage was\r\nthirty-one and three-fourths bushels per acre, and after drainage\r\nseventy-four and one-fourth bushels per acre.\r\n\r\nIn order to determine the influence of drainage upon health, physicians,\r\nwho had, during the same two periods of five years each, answered all\r\ncalls in cases of disease, were asked to report from their books all cases\r\nof malarial fever. It was found from this data that, for the first period\r\nof five years before drainage, there had been 1,480 cases of malarial\r\ndisease. During the next five years under a pretty good system of\r\ndrainage, there were but 490 cases of such disease. These facts show that\r\ndrainage not only brings material prosperity to the individual, but\r\npromotes the general healthfulness of the climate of that district, in\r\nwhich all are interested and all enjoy.\r\n\r\nIt is a matter of note that the Campagne about Rome, which in ancient days\r\nwas the healthful home of a dense population, is now afflicted with the\r\nmost deadly fevers. It is claimed by high authorities that this is due to\r\nthe destruction and choking of the drains which in excavating are found\r\neverywhere, but always filled and useless.\r\n\r\nIt will be readily seen that this subject has at least two important\r\nbearings upon our prosperity, and though in considering and perfecting\r\ngeneral farm drainage, the effect upon health may be manifested without\r\neffort being put forth in that direction, yet it should always be kept in\r\nmind and receive that consideration which it deserves.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAINAGE AND FANCY FARMING.\r\n\r\nIt is thought by many who have not yet tested the value of tile drainage,\r\nthat it is one of those luxuries often indulged in by so-called fancy\r\nfarmers. By such farmers is meant those who farm for pleasure rather than\r\nfor profit; those who raise wheat which costs them $1 per bushel, but\r\nwhich is worth only eighty cents on the market; those who raise beef at a\r\ncost of ten cents per lb. and sell it for six cents per lb.; in\r\nshort, they are men (and there are many of them) who receive their income\r\nfrom some other source, and cultivate a farm for recreation. That drainage\r\nproperly belongs to this class of farmers is a mistaken notion, as\r\nhundreds of thrifty, money-making farmers in the West would prove, could\r\nthey now give their experience. In the example previously given, drainage\r\nincreased the production of wheat and corn fully 100 per cent, which was a\r\ntownship report for five years. In order to emphasize these statements, we\r\nwill insert a few practical examples communicated to the Drainage Journal\r\nduring last year.\r\n\r\nGeo. P. Robertson: \"One ten-acre field failed to produce anything except a\r\nfew small ears. I drained it, and have cropped it for eight years\r\nsuccessively, and have paid time and again for husking 100 bushels of corn\r\nper acre.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Losee, Norwich, Canada, says that as a matter of actual test, his\r\nunderdrained land yields one-third larger crops than his undrained fields,\r\nalthough the same treatment in other respects is applied, and the land is\r\nof the same character throughout. The average wheat yield of his undrained\r\nland is twenty bushels per acre, while the drained fields yielded an\r\naverage of thirty bushels. As the cost of draining on his farm is\r\nestimated at $20 per acre, this preparation of the soil pays for itself in\r\ntwo years.\"\r\n\r\nHorton Ferguson, Indiana: \"The swamp contained twenty-seven acres, and was\r\nregarded by all neighbors as utterly worthless except for hunting grounds.\r\nMr. Ferguson, who has great faith in underdraining, determined to\r\nundertake to reclaim the land, confident if successfully done, it would be\r\na paying investment. Last year he tile drained and grubbed it, paying\r\ncustomary rates for all the labor and tile, and this year put it in corn,\r\nwith the following result:\r\n\r\n                                         Dr.      Cr.\r\n     Tile used for 27 acres            $544 87\r\n     Paid for ditching                   88 00\r\n     Expense for clearing and grubbing  275 00\r\n                                       -------\r\n     Total expense                     $907 87\r\n                                               --------\r\n     By 2,530 bushels of corn at 50 cents      $1,265 00\r\n\r\nThe land proved to be remarkably rich, having produced, as shown, ninety\r\nbushels to the acre, and Mr. F. assures us that several acres exceeded 100\r\nbushels to the acre. It will thus be observed that he realized the first\r\nyear of cultivation enough to pay the entire expense of reclaiming and had\r\n$357.13 left to pay on the crop expense. Next season, if favorable, he\r\nexpects a still better yield.\"\r\n\r\nEvery farmer knows that, in these times of easy transportation, profits do\r\nnot depend so much upon the price his product brings in the market as upon\r\nthe quantity he has to dispose of. In other words, abundant crops are the\r\nfarmer's source of income. There is evidence enough at hand to justify the\r\nstatement that of all improvements put upon farms containing wet land\r\nvalued at $40 per acre and upwards, drainage pays the largest profit for\r\nthe outlay. Just what this profit will be will depend upon the soil\r\ndrained, the necessary cost required to improve it, and the use and\r\nmanagement of it after it is drained. All of these things vary so that\r\neach case must be considered by itself. Drainage is simply a necessary\r\npart of good husbandry which merits the careful consideration of all\r\nthinking farmers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPlan for a Flood Gate.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo maintain a fence across a water course, is one of the trials and\r\ntribulations of the farmer. After a heavy rain, generally fences in such\r\nplaces are either badly damaged or entirely washed away. Having been\r\ntroubled this way for years, I have hit upon the following plan, which,\r\nafter two years' trial I find to be a success.\r\n\r\nA stick of timber, three or four inches in diameter, is placed where the\r\ngate is needed, and fastened down with stakes, driven slanting, on each\r\nside, the tops of the stakes lapping over the piece so as to hold it\r\nsecurely, and driven well down, so as not to catch the drift, but allowing\r\nthe piece to turn freely; inch and half holes are bored in the piece and\r\nuprights are fitted in them; the material of which the gate is made is\r\nfastened to these uprights. A light post is driven on the lower side and\r\nthe gate fastened to it.\r\n\r\nThis will keep the gate in place in any ordinary flood, but when a Noah\r\ncomes along, it turns down on the bottom of creek, and waters and drifts\r\npass over it. When the water subsides all that is necessary to do is to\r\nturn the gate back to its upright position. If the gate is not needed\r\nduring the winter, it is better to lay it down and let it remain in that\r\nposition until spring, for if it is fastened with the post in an upright\r\nposition, it will be broken with the spring floods.     A. E. B.\r\nCARTHAGE, ILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGreat Corn Crops.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt having been mentioned in the Iowa State Register some weeks ago that\r\nMr. Hezekiah Fagan, of Polk county, in that State, had once grown one\r\nhundred and fifty-eight bushels of corn per acre, a son of Mr. Fagan\r\nwrites the following regarding the kinds of corn, the ground, and the\r\nmanner of cultivation:\r\n\r\n\"Father's farm joined Brown's Park on the north and run a mile north; the\r\ncorn was raised where the old orchard now is; it was part prairie and part\r\nbrush land, and was about the third crop. The ground was plowed in the\r\nspring, harrowed and marked out with a single shovel both ways, the rows\r\nbeing four feet apart each way. The corn was dropped by hand and covered\r\nwith a hoe, and left without harrowing until large enough to plow, and was\r\nplowed twice with single shovel, and once with the two horse stirring plow\r\nand hilled up as high as possible, and hoed enough to keep clean. The seed\r\nwas from corn father brought from Rockville, Ind., with him when he moved\r\nto Des Moines, in the spring of 1848, and was of the large, yellow variety\r\nwhich matured then and matures now with anything like a good season, and I\r\nverily believe that with as good ground and as good treatment and as much\r\ncare in having every hill standing, and from three to four stalks in every\r\nhill, that the amount might be raised again, if it was over 150 bushels\r\nper acre, and I must say that I have never seen a large variety of corn\r\nthat suited me so well, that would yield so much, or mature so well, and\r\nif any Iowa farmer will come and look at my crib of corn of this year's\r\nraising, and if he will say he can show a better average ear raised on\r\nsimilar ground, with similar treatment, I would like to speak for a few\r\nbushels for seed at almost any price, and I will not except the\r\nmuch-puffed Leaming variety.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man adds that his advice to Iowa farmers is, \"to raise big\r\nhorses, big cattle, big hogs, big corn, and big grass, and if the profits\r\nare not big, too, they had better make up their minds farming isn't their\r\nforte, and go at something else.\"\r\n\r\nBeing desirous of knowing something of his big corn yield we wrote to Mr.\r\nClarkson, of the Register, for further information, and received the\r\nfollowing reply:\r\n\r\n    DEAR SIR: Yours of the 7th inst., relative to the Fagan corn\r\n    received. The corn raised by Hezekiah Fagan was thirty years\r\n    ago, and he received the premium for it at the Iowa State\r\n    Fair in 1854. The only facts I have relative to it are in\r\n    the published proceedings of the State Agricultural Society.\r\n    It states that he raised in Polk county, Iowa, on five\r\n    acres, at the rate of 139-1/2 bushels per acre, shelled\r\n    corn. The whole, shelled, measured 697-1/2 bushels, but\r\n    weighed, it made 151 bushels and fifty-three pounds per\r\n    acre.\r\n\r\n    At the same fair, J. W. Inskip exhibited, with all of the\r\n    necessary proofs, 136 bushels per acre.\r\n\r\n    I think there was no mistake in these matters, as great care\r\n    was taken to have statement correct; it is to this crop\r\n    which his son refers in a late number of the Register. Yours\r\n    truly,     C. F. CLARKSON.\r\n    DES MOINES, IOWA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Charming Letter.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the head of the agricultural department in THE PRAIRIE FARMER I notice\r\na standing invitation, viz.: \"Farmers, write for your paper.\" All right!\r\nNow, if you will just move up a little I'll take a seat in your\r\nCommunicative Association.\r\n\r\nWe, that is my wife and myself, eagerly read and discuss the interesting\r\narticles with which THE PRAIRIE FARMER is replete every week, and many are\r\nthe practical hints that we have found therein.\r\n\r\nIt is not strange that, in the heart of a new country with vast\r\nundeveloped resources and unlimited possibilities, a young farmer who has\r\nhis fortune yet to make, should be particularly enthusiastic. Tired of the\r\natmosphere of the school-room, fagged out by ten years of study and\r\nteaching, and plainly seeing the improbability of being able to lay by\r\nenough for a rainy day or old age in this noble, but as a rule,\r\nunremunerative calling, my mind involuntarily reverted back to my early\r\nlife on the old homestead in Illinois, to substantials implied in that\r\nword, and to its pleasant memories.\r\n\r\nMy mind was made up. With my portion of the old homestead in my pocket, I\r\nturned the key in the school-house door, grateful for the experience and\r\nlessons of patience gained inside of it, a friend of education, and with a\r\nheart full of sympathy for the teachers of our public schools. I came to\r\n\"the land of the Dakotas\" once more to break the \"stubborn glebe\" and\r\nenjoy the sweets of farm life. Next June I shall have had three years'\r\nexperience in my new undertaking. I have succeeded fairly well. At some\r\nfuture time I may communicate something about raising wheat and vegetables\r\nin Dakota, to the readers of \"our paper.\"\r\n\r\nThis winter is proving to be rather long and stormy, but with plenty of\r\nfuel, good books and papers, time has not hung heavily on my hands.\r\nIndeed, I consider these long Northern winters a decided advantage to\r\nthose who regard the cultivation of the mind as important as the\r\ncultivation of the fields. I am afraid the majority of farmers do not lay\r\nenough stress upon mental culture. In this age of cheap books there can be\r\nno excuse for being without them. Systematic reading leads to the best\r\nresults in mental culture just as systematic farming leads to the best\r\nresults in agriculture. At the beginning of the winter I select some\r\nstandard work as my principal reading matter and stick to it until I have\r\nit completed, reading for an interlude, good weekly newspapers, and one or\r\ntwo of the standard magazines, with which I always like to be supplied.\r\nThis breaks up all monotony, and makes reading thoroughly enjoyable and\r\ninstructive. This winter I am reading the works of Goethe, the great\r\nGerman author.\r\n\r\nMarch, the last winter month, has come, and although the wind is still\r\nhowling and snow flying, before the first of April we expect to see the\r\nrailroads thronged with emigrant cars bringing new settlers, more thrift\r\nand more capital. Thousands of new homes will be established on the\r\nfertile prairies next summer.\r\n\r\nWill you please regard this as a kind of an introduction into your\r\n\"association?\"\r\n\r\nIf we find that we are mutually agreeable perhaps we shall find occasion\r\nto meet again.\r\n\r\nKASPER VON ESCHENBACH, PRAIRIE PARK FARM, BATH, D. T.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrairie Roads.\r\n\r\nThe article on prairie roads in THE PRAIRIE FARMER of March 1st, 1884, by\r\nA. G. H., of Champaign county, was good, and I would like to see more on\r\nthe same subject. If we get any better roads, we must keep the ball\r\nrolling.\r\n\r\nThe great objection to the Ross plan, or any plan of road-tiling here, is\r\nthis. When tile is laid in the roadway the teams will travel right over\r\nit, and the black soil gets packed and puddled until it is as impervious\r\nto water as clay, and the water can't get into the tile. And on the clay\r\nhillsides, if the tile is covered with clay, the water can't get into it.\r\nThis has been well tested here, for we have been road-tiling for six\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe question seems to be to get the water into the tile. The answer is\r\nsimple enough. We must provide sink holes for it. We must fill the ditch\r\nover the tile with sand, gravel, or anything that will let the water in, a\r\nyard in length, say, once every rod. Then I think the Ross plan would be\r\nperfect.\r\n\r\nAs to the cost, well, $750 per mile seems large, but to take an average of\r\nthe roads in our county one-half that sum would answer, for it is only the\r\nworst places would need the full Ross plan.\r\n\r\nIn a good many places, one string of tile with gravel sinks would do, and\r\nothers with the laterals to drain all to one side, thus saving the cost of\r\none string of tile, or more than one-third of the whole cost.\r\n\r\nNow, if we get the commissioners to commence the work, we must vote for\r\nmen who are in favor of road-tiling as commissioners. There is where the\r\nbattle must be fought. Buckle on the armor comrades and see that the work\r\nis done.\r\n\r\nW. H. S., MCLEAN CO., ILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nExperiments With Indian Corn.\r\n\r\nOn May 16, 135 kinds of corn were planted in the garden, with the\r\nintention of promoting the cross fertilization of the varieties in order\r\nto study the effects. The seed used was some of it selected on account of\r\nits purity; other seed was from named varieties, still other seed from\r\nvarieties purposely hybridized, or presumed from their appearance or\r\nlocation on the ear to be hybridized; and seed which possessed\r\npeculiarities in appearance. The types represented were the three kinds of\r\npop-corns, the flint pop, the pearl pop, and the rice pop; the flints in\r\neight-rowed and twelve-rowed varieties, and soft or Tuscarora's; the\r\nsweets in two or more types of ear, the one corresponding to the flint,\r\nanother to the dent corn ear; and the dents also in two or more types, the\r\neight-rowed with broad kernel, and another, the many rowed, with deep\r\nkernel. We also had a pod or husk corn.\r\n\r\nThrough a study of the crop from these various seeds, we are enabled to\r\nmake some general conclusions, which probably are sufficient to generalize\r\nfrom, but which certainly apply to the case in hand.\r\n\r\nThe seed of the preceding year gives uniformity of ear; that is, a dent\r\ncorn seed may produce an eight-rowed flint, or an eighteen-rowed dent, but\r\neach ear will be perfect of its kind, and will be free from kernels of\r\nother type than its own. The flint corn kernel may produce several\r\nvarieties of flint corn ear, or dent corn ear, but there will be no\r\nvariety in the kernel upon the ear; a dent corn seed may furnish a sweet\r\ncorn ear, and dent corn ears, but not mixed upon the cob. A pop-corn\r\nkernel may produce a sweet corn ear, of sweet corn type, a sweet corn ear\r\nof pop-corn type, or a pop-corn ear of the various types, without\r\nadmixture of kernels upon the ears.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, hybridization of the current year produces changes in\r\nthe kernel, so that one ear of corn may bear kernels of various colors,\r\nand of various types, the tendency, however, being for the shape of the\r\nkernel to be governed by the type of the maize ear upon which it is found.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of various types upon an ear allow of some curious\r\ngeneralizations. Thus, the rice pop kernel form does not appear upon ears\r\nof other character, nor does the pearl pop kernel form appear upon the\r\nrice pop ear. The flint pop does not seem to appear upon either the rice\r\nor the pearl pop type, so far as form is concerned, but its structure,\r\nhowever, influences. Sweet corn, however, appears upon the three types of\r\npop-corn indiscriminately, but, on the other hand, the pop-corns do not\r\nappear upon the flint corn ears. While flint corn appears abundantly on\r\nsweet corn ears, on the other hand, sweet corn does not appear upon the\r\nflint corns. Dent corn kernels will appear upon the sweet corn whose type\r\nof ear is that of the dent ear, but not upon sweet corn whose type is that\r\nof the flint ear. The dent corn, again, does not appear upon the flint\r\near, but in some isolated instances the flint corn kernel may appear upon\r\nthe dent ear.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of kernels of one variety upon ears of another variety, for\r\neach of the types, is of frequent and constant occurrence, except in the\r\ncase of red ears. The red ears have a constancy of color which is truly\r\nremarkable: where sweet corn appears upon red pop and red dent ears the\r\nsweet corn partakes of the red color.\r\n\r\nThe practical value of these deductions consists in the guide they afford\r\ntoward the improvement of the varieties of corn that we grow. For\r\ninstance: by planting in adjoining hills, or, better still, the mixed seed\r\nof two varieties of corn, one of which is distinguished for its length of\r\near and smallness of cob, and the other for the large size of its kernel,\r\nwe should anticipate, in many instances, the transfer of the large kernel\r\nto the small ear and of the small kernel to the large ear. By selecting\r\nfrom the crop those ears which have length and the large kernel, we should\r\nanticipate, by a series of selections, the attaining of a new variety, in\r\nwhich the large kernel and length of cob would be persistent. The same\r\nremarks hold true with the dent corns. But in the matter of selections the\r\ntrue principle would seem to be to plant but one kernel of the desired\r\ntype from an ear of the desired type, and to keep the plant from this\r\nkernel free from the influence of plants of another type, and securing the\r\ncrop through self-fertilization. After the first year of this procedure,\r\nby the selection of two or more kernels of the same type from different\r\nplants, cross fertilization should be used, the crop being gradually\r\npurified by selection.\r\n\r\nWhile the maize plant, as a rule, is not self-fertilized, that is, as a\r\ngeneral thing the pollen from one plant fertilizes the silk of another,\r\nyet in very many cases the pollen and the silk upon the same plant is\r\nsynchronous, and self-fertilization becomes possible, and undoubtedly is\r\nof frequent occurrence. The pollen ripens from below upward, and thus the\r\nfall of the pollen, through the successive ripening of the blooms, may\r\nlast for three or four days, and there is a great variation in period of\r\nblooming as between individual plants. The silk maintains its receptivity\r\nfor pollen for some little time, but for how long a period we do not yet\r\nknow from direct observation. It seems, however, true, that closely\r\nfollowing pollination, the silk loses its transparent structure and begins\r\nto shrivel, while before pollination is effected the silk retains its\r\nsucculency for several days.--_E.

Exp.\r\nStation._\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecialty Farming.\r\n\r\nI noticed in THE PRAIRIE FARMER of February 23d, a communication from Cape\r\nGirardeau, Mo., on \"The Dignity of Our Calling.\" It contains some very\r\ngood reasoning, but I do not indorse it all, and take this mode of\r\nexpressing my views upon the subject. The point upon which I beg leave to\r\ndiffer from the gentleman is, should a farmer have a smattering idea of\r\neverything pertaining to farming?\r\n\r\nI believe that a man should make a specialty of some particular branch of\r\nfarming, for it is universally conceded by all competent authority that no\r\nman can succeed in a given pursuit unless his time and energies are\r\nconcentrated in that direction, consequently we have successful men in all\r\nthe avenues of life--and why? from the simple fact that these men make a\r\nspecialty of some particular branch of their calling; they are no\r\njack-of-all-trades--not by any means.\r\n\r\nSo it is with farming; the man who endeavors to be proficient in all its\r\ndepartments is apt to be a failure, while his specialist neighbor\r\nsucceeds, simply because he has his course marked out, and bends his\r\nenergies in that direction. Life is too short for a man to comprehend\r\neverything. It is true, that the farmer has no fixed law by which to guide\r\nhim; however, he must, in measure, be governed by past experience. If the\r\nfarmer does his part, God will do the rest. In my opinion, what we want,\r\nis not learning in every branch of farming by the same individual, but we\r\ndo want lore in a given direction, and then success will crown our every\r\neffort. Take as an example one of our large machine shops; do we find its\r\nworkmen, each one, commencing a machine and completing it in all its\r\nparts. No; each man has a special task to perform, only that and nothing\r\nmore. As to farmers' sons longing for other callings, I am forced to admit\r\nthat it is a lamentable fact which can not be ignored. I believe the\r\nreason for this is that they are constantly coming in contact with nature\r\nin all her varied forms, and before they have yet reached their majority,\r\nthey become inspired with an ambition which is prone to go beyond the\r\nboundary of farm life, hence we find them, step by step, climbing the\r\nladder of fame. However, we have one consoling fact, and that is, they\r\nmake some of the most noted men we have--find them where you may. A\r\nglorious example of this is in the person of a man who rose from the\r\nhumble position of plowboy, to that of Chief Executive of the Nation.\r\n\r\nA few words more and I am done. If the fathers of this land would have\r\ntheir sons follow the noble vocation of farming, let them educate them\r\nthoroughly for the branch which they would have them pursue, and by so\r\ndoing teach them that proficiency in any given direction is sure to\r\ncommand respect and success.     SUBSCRIBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nField and Furrow.\r\n\r\nOne of the strong points in preparing horses for spring work is in having\r\ntheir shoulders in a good, sound condition. With this to start with and\r\nsoft and well-fitting collars there need be but little fear of any\r\ndifficulty in keeping them all right, no matter how hard the labor horses\r\nhave to endure. By keeping the collars well cleared of any dirt which may\r\naccumulate upon them from the sweating of the horse, and by bathing them\r\ndaily with cold water, there need be but little fear of bad shoulders.\r\n\r\nHUSBANDMAN: Every member of the Elmira Farmers' Club present had used\r\nsapling clover, more or less, and all regarded it with favor, although for\r\nmaking hay common red clover is worth more, as it is also for pasture. Mr.\r\nWard expressed the opinion, in which all shared, that there were really\r\nbut two varieties of field clover in common use at the North, red clover,\r\nusually called medium, and the large, or sapling clover. The chief\r\nfunction of the clover root as a fertilizer is in bringing nitrogen from\r\nthe lower soil upward within reach of succeeding crops and changing its\r\nform to meet the requirements of the plant and crops that follow.\r\n\r\nBROW CHEMICAL CO. CIRCULAR: The wise farmer will change his seed from year\r\nto year. A remarkable feature of the variety in potatoes is that no two\r\nkinds of potato are made up of the same chemical components in precisely\r\nthe same proportion. There are now over 300 varieties of potatoes of\r\ngreater or less merit. Some are celebrated for their large size, some for\r\ntheir fineness of texture and some for the great increase which may be\r\nexpected from them. One hundred and thirteen years ago there were but two\r\nknown varieties of potatoes, one being white, the other red. If the soil\r\nis too poor potatoes starve, if too wet they catch cold, and refuse to\r\ngrow to perfection.\r\n\r\nFARMER'S ADVOCATE: Spring operations will soon commence, and with these a\r\ndemand for good farm hands. The general rule that is followed in this\r\ncountry is to put off the hiring of men to the last moment, and trust to\r\nchances for some one coming along, and then probably some inferior workman\r\nhas to be taken, or none at all. Men who know their business on a farm\r\nwill not wait, and are early picked up in the neighborhood in which they\r\nmay reside. The trusting to men coming along just at the exact moment you\r\nare crowded, is a bad policy. There should always be profitable employment\r\nfor a man in the early spring months before seeding commences, and it will\r\npay any farmer to secure good farm hands early; and pay them good wages.\r\n\r\nPEORIA TRANSCRIPT: We prepared a half acre of ground as good as we knew\r\nhow. Upon one-half of this plat we planted one bushel of seed obtained\r\nfrom Michigan, and upon the other half of home-grown seed, both being of\r\nthe variety known as Snowflake. The two lots of seed cut for planting were\r\nsimilar in appearance, both as regards size and quality. The whole lot\r\nreceived the same treatment during the growing season. The plants made\r\nabout the same growth on the two plats and suffered equally from bugs; but\r\nwhen it came to digging, those from new seed yielded two bushels of large\r\npotatoes for every one that could be secured on the land planted with seed\r\nof our own growing. This difference in yield could be accounted for on no\r\nother theory than the change in seed, as the quality of seed, soil, and\r\nculture were the same. This leads to the belief that simply procuring seed\r\nof favorite varieties from a distance would insure us good crops at much\r\nless expense than can be done experimenting with new, high-priced seeds.\r\n\r\nIn another column a Kansas correspondent speaks of the crab grass in an\r\nexceedingly favorable way. We find the following regarding this grass in a\r\nlate New York Times: Every Northern farmer knows the common coarse grass\r\ncalled door-yard grass, which has long, broad leaves, a tough, bunchy\r\nroot, and a three-fingered spreading head, which contains large, round\r\nseeds. It is known as Eleusine Indica, and grows luxuriously in open\r\ndrains and moist places. It appears late in the summer. This is an\r\nextremely valuable grass in the South. A friend who went to Georgia soon\r\nafter the war bought an abandoned plantation on account of the grass\r\ngrowing upon it. It was this door-yard grass. He pastured sheep upon it\r\nand cut some for hay. Northern baled hay was selling at $30 a ton at that\r\ntime. He wrote asking me to buy him two mowers and a baling press, and\r\nwent to baling hay for the Southern market, selling his sheep and living\r\nan easy life except in haying time. His three hundred acres of cleared\r\nland has produced an average of 200 tons of hay every year which gives him\r\nabout four times as much profit as an acre of cotton would do. Perhaps\r\nthere may come an end to this business, and the grass will run out for\r\nwant of fresh seed, but with a yearly dressing of Charleston phosphate the\r\ngrass has kept up its original vigor. Now why could we not make some use\r\nof this grass, and of others, such as quack-grass, which defy so\r\npersistently all our efforts to destroy them?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Entomological]\r\n\r\n\r\nInsects in Illinois.\r\n\r\nProf. Forbes, State Entomologist, makes the following report to the State\r\nBoard of Agriculture:\r\n\r\n\"Now that our year's entomological campaign is completed, a brief review\r\nof some of its most important features and results will doubtless be of\r\ninterest. Early attention was given to the insects attacking corn in the\r\nground, before the sprout has appeared above the surface. A surprising\r\nnumber were found to infest it at this period, the results of their\r\ninjuries being usually attributed by farmers to the weather, defective\r\nseed, etc. Among these the seed corn maggot (Anthomyia zeae) was frequently\r\nnoted, and was received from many parts of the State. A small,\r\nblack-headed maggot, the larva of a very abundant, gnat-like fly (Seiara),\r\nwas excessively common in ground which had been previously in grass, and\r\nattacked the seed corn if it did not germinate promptly and vigorously,\r\nbut apparently did not injure perfectly sound and healthy grains. A minute\r\nyellow ant (Solenopsis fugax) was seen actually gnawing and licking away\r\nthe substance of the sound kernels in the ground, both before and after\r\nthey had sprouted. The corn plant-louse (Aphis maidis) was an early and\r\ndestructive enemy of the crop, often throttling the young shoot before it\r\nhad broken ground. It was chiefly confined to fields which had been just\r\npreviously in corn or grass.\r\n\r\n\"The chinch-bug was found in spring depositing the eggs for its first\r\nbrood of young about the roots of the corn, a habit not hitherto reported.\r\n\r\n\"With the increasing attention to the culture of sorghum, its insect\r\nenemies are coming rapidly to the front. Four species of plant-lice, two\r\nof them new, made a vigorous attack upon this crop in the vicinity of\r\nChampaign, and two of them were likewise abundant in broom-corn.\r\n\r\n\"The corn root-worm (Diabrotica longicornis) was occasionally met with in\r\nsorghum, but does not seem likely to do any great mischief to that plant.\r\nIt could not be found in broom-corn. In fields of maize, however, it was\r\nagain very destructive, where corn had been raised on the same ground a\r\nyear or two before. The Hessian Fly did great damage throughout the winter\r\nwheat region of the State, many fields not being worth harvesting in\r\nconsequence of its ravages. Several facts were collected tending to show\r\nthat it is three brooded in the southern part of the State. Nearly or\r\nquite all the last brood passed the summer as \"flax seeds\" in the stubble,\r\nwhere they might easily have been destroyed by general and concerted\r\naction. Fortunately, the summer weather was unfavorable to their\r\ndevelopment; and the drouth conspired with their parasites to greatly\r\ndiminish their numbers. In the regions under our observation, not one in a\r\nthousand emerged from the midsummer pupa-cases, and numbers of the larvae\r\nwere found completely dried up.\r\n\r\n\"The wheat straw-worm (Isosoma tritici), a minute, slender, yellow grub,\r\nwhich burrows inside the growing stem, dwarfing or blighting the forming\r\nhead, was abundant throughout the winter wheat region of Southern\r\nIllinois, causing, in some places, a loss scarcely exceeded by that due to\r\nthe Hessian Fly. Our breeding experiments demonstrate that this insect\r\nwinters in the straw as larvae or pupa, emerging as an adult fly early in\r\nspring, these flies laying their eggs upon the stems after they commence\r\nto joint. As the flies are very minute, and nearly all are wingless, their\r\nspread from field to field is slow, and it seems entirely within the power\r\nof the individual farmer to control this insect by burning or otherwise\r\ndestroying the stubble in summer or autumn, and burning the surplus of the\r\nstraw not fed to stock early in spring. A simple rotation of crops,\r\ndevoting land previously in wheat to some other grain or to grass, will\r\nanswer instead of burning the stubble.\r\n\r\n\"The life history of the wheat bulb-worm (Meromyza Americana) was\r\ncompleted this year. The second or summer brood did decided injury to\r\nwheat in Fulton county, so many of the heads being killed that some of the\r\nfields looked gray at a little distance. This species was also injurious\r\nto rye, but much less so than to wheat. It certainly does not attack oats\r\nat all; fields of that grain raised where winter wheat had been destroyed\r\nby it, and plowed up, being entirely free from it, while wheat fields\r\nadjacent were badly damaged. We have good evidence that postponement of\r\nsowing to as late a date as possible prevents the ravages of this insect,\r\nin the same way as it does those of the Hessian Fly.\r\n\r\n\"The common rose chafer (Macrodactylus subspinosus) greatly injured some\r\nfields of corn in Will county, the adult beetle devouring the leaves.\r\n\r\n\"The 'flea negro-bug' (Thyreocoris pulicarius) was found injurious to\r\nwheat in Montgomery county, draining the sap from the heads before\r\nmaturity, so that the kernel shriveled and ripened prematurely. In parts\r\nof some fields the crop was thus almost wholly destroyed.\r\n\r\n\"The entomological record of the orchard and the fruit garden is not less\r\neventful than that of the farm. In extreme Southern Illinois, the forest\r\ntent caterpillar (Clislocampa sylvatica) made a frightful inroad upon the\r\napple orchard, absolutely defoliating every tree in large districts. It\r\nalso did great mischief to many forest trees. Its injuries to fruit might\r\nhave been almost wholly prevented, either by destroying the eggs upon the\r\ntwigs of the trees in autumn, as was successfully done by many, or by\r\nspraying the foliage of infested trees in spring with Paris green, or\r\nsimilar poison, as was done with the best effect and at but slight expense\r\nby Mr. David Ayres, of Villa Ridge. Great numbers of these caterpillars\r\nwere killed by a contagious disease, which swept them off just as they\r\nwere ready to transform to the chrysalis; but vast quantities of the eggs\r\nare now upon the trees, ready to hatch in spring.\r\n\r\n\"A large apple orchard in Hancock county dropped a great part of its crop\r\non account of injuries done to the fruit by the plum curculio\r\n(Conotrachelus nenuphar). There is little question that these insects were\r\nforced to scatter through the apple orchard by the destruction, the\r\nprevious autumn, of an old peach orchard which had been badly infested by\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"In Southern strawberry fields, very serious loss was occasioned by the\r\ntarnished plant-bug (Lygus lineolaris), which I have demonstrated to be at\r\nleast a part of the cause of the damage known as the 'buttoning' of the\r\nberry. The dusky plant-bug (Deraecoris rapidus) worked upon the\r\nstrawberries in precisely the same manner and at the same time, in some\r\nfields being scarcely less abundant than the other. I have found that both\r\nthese species may be promptly and cheaply killed by pyrethrum, either\r\ndiluted with flour or suspended in water, and also by an emulsion of\r\nkerosene, so diluted with water that the mixture shall contain about 3 per\r\ncent of kerosene.\r\n\r\n\"The so-called 'strawberry root-worm' of Southern Illinois proves to be\r\nnot one species merely, but three--the larvae of Colaspsis brunnae, Paria\r\naterrima and Scelodonta pubescens. The periods and life histories of these\r\nthree species are curiously different, so that they succeed each other in\r\ntheir attacks upon the strawberry roots, instead of competing for food at\r\nthe same time. The three together infest the plant during nearly the whole\r\ngrowing season--Colaspsis first, Paria next, and Scelodonta last. The\r\nbeetles all feed upon the leaves in July and August, and may then be\r\npoisoned with Paris green.\r\n\r\n\"The season has been specially characterized by the occurrence of several\r\nwidespread and destructive contagious diseases among insects. Elaborate\r\nstudies of these have demonstrated that they are due to bacteria and other\r\nparasitic fungi, that these disease germs may be artificially cultivated\r\noutside the bodies of the insects, and that when sown or sprinkled upon\r\nthe food of healthy individuals, the disease follows as a consequence. We\r\nhave in this the beginning of a new method of combating insect injuries\r\nwhich promises some useful results.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIllinois Central Railroad.\r\n\r\nThe elegant equipment of coaches and sleepers being added to its various\r\nthrough routes is gaining it many friends.

The premiums for dressed carcasses have been largely\r\nincreased over last year.\r\n\r\n\r\nPolled Aberdeen Cattle.\r\n\r\nThe subject of our 1st page illustration, Black Prince, is a\r\nrepresentative of that black, hornless race, which had its foundation in\r\nScotland several hundred years ago, known as Polled Aberdeen-Angus Cattle.\r\nThis breed of cattle has grown into very high favor in America during the\r\nlast five or six years; so much so, that, while in 1879 the number of\r\nrepresentatives of this race in America were very few, now the demand for\r\nthem is so great that the number imported yearly is easily disposed of at\r\nprices ranging from $250 to $2,000. Messrs. Geary Bros., London, Ont., say\r\nthat the demand for such cattle during the past winter has never been\r\nequaled in their long experience. As the prevalence of the foot-and-mouth\r\ndisease in Great Britain, will, without a doubt cause the importation of\r\ncattle from that country to be prohibited at an early day, it is safe to\r\nsay that the value of such stock must rise, as the number of its\r\nrepresentatives in America is limited, and those who have such stock in\r\ntheir possession fully appreciate their value; and not being under the\r\nnecessity of selling, will hold their Aberdeen-Angus cattle unless enticed\r\nby a very high price. Therefore, the coming public sale of Aberdeen-Angus\r\ncattle in Chicago may be looked forward to as going to show unequaled\r\naverage prices and especially of individual prize animals.\r\n\r\nBlack Prince was bought by Messrs. Geary Bros., London, Ont., in Scotland,\r\nand brought to America last year. In him are to be found all the fine\r\ncharacteristics of his race. He took the second place at the Smithfield\r\nFat Stock Show of 1883; at the Kansas Fat Stock Show of the same year he\r\nwas placed second to the Short-horn steer Starlight; and at the last Fat\r\nStock Show of Chicago he took first place among the best three-year-olds\r\nof the country. At the time of entry for the Chicago Show he was 1,380\r\ndays old, and his weight 2,330 pounds, almost 175 pounds less than he\r\nweighed before leaving Scotland for this country. Besides the prizes above\r\nmentioned, Black Prince won numerous honors in his own country before\r\ncoming here.\r\n\r\nTheir black, glossy, thick coats, their hornless heads, and particularly\r\ntheir low-set, smooth, round and lengthy bodies are the principal features\r\nof this breed.\r\n\r\nBeef consumers will find them in the front rank for yielding wholesome,\r\nnourishing food, juicy, tender, and of the best flavor, free from all\r\nunpalatable masses of fat or tallow. It is these favorable characteristics\r\nwhich have gained such an excellent, and widespread reputation for the\r\nAberdeen-Angus cattle. The growing belief that the best breed of beeves is\r\nthe one that for a given quantity of food, and in the shortest time will\r\nproduce the greatest weight of nutritious food combined with the smallest\r\namount of bone, tallow, and other waste is going to make these cattle as\r\npopular with our beef consumers and producers generally as they have been\r\nwith those who have long been familiar with their many superior qualities.\r\n\r\n\r\nGrass for Hogs.\r\n\r\nWith plenty of milk and mill-feed to mix with the corn, good hogs may be\r\ngrown without grass. But with corn alone, the task of growing and\r\nfattening a hog without grass costs more than the hog is worth.\r\n\r\nTo make hog-growing profitable to the farmer, he must have grass. In the\r\nolder States where the tame grasses are plenty, it is a very thoughtless\r\nfarmer who has not his hog pasture. But out here in Kansas and Nebraska,\r\nwhere we have plenty of corn, but no grass, except the wild varieties, the\r\nmost enterprising of us are at our wits' ends. Hogs will eat these wild\r\ngrasses while tender in the spring, and, even without corn, will grow\r\nlong, tall, and wonderfully lean, and in the fall will fatten much more\r\nreadily than hogs grown on corn. But fattening the lean hogs takes too\r\nmuch corn. We must have a grass that the hogs will relish, and on which\r\nthey will both grow and fatten. They will do this on clover, orchard\r\ngrass, bluegrass, and other tame grasses. But we have not got any of\r\nthese, nor do we know how to get them. Hundreds of bushels of tame grass\r\nseeds are sold every spring by our implement dealers. A few have succeeded\r\nin getting some grass, but nine out of ten lose their seed. We either do\r\nnot know how to grow it, or the seed is not good, or the soil is too new.\r\nThe truth, perhaps, lies a little in all three. Our agricultural colleges\r\nare claiming to have success with these grasses, and their experience\r\nwould be of value to the farmers if these reports could ever reach them.\r\nNot one farmer in a hundred ever sees them. I know of but one farmer of\r\nsufficient political influence to receive these reports through the mails.\r\nThe rest of us can get them for the asking. But not many of us know this,\r\nfewer know whom to ask, and still fewer ask. I do not know a farmer that\r\norders a single copy. Farmers, living about our county towns, and doing\r\ntheir trading there, and having leisure enough to loaf about the public\r\noffices, and curiosity enough to scratch through the dust-covered piles of\r\nold papers and rubbish in the corner, are usually rewarded by finding a\r\ncopy of these valuable reports. But we, who live far away from the county\r\nseat, do our farming without this aid, and mostly without any knowledge of\r\ntheir existence. This looks like a lamentable state of agricultural\r\nstupidity. Notwithstanding this dark picture we would all read, and be\r\ngreatly profited by these reports, if they were laid on our tables.\r\n\r\nIf it pays to expend so much labor and money in preparing these reports\r\nand sending them half way to the people, would it not be wise to expend a\r\nlittle more and complete the journey, by making it the duty of the\r\nassessor to leave a copy on every farmer's table? Compulsory education.\r\n\r\nAs an explanation of much of the above, it must be remembered that we are\r\nnearly all recently from the East, that we have brought with us our\r\nEastern experience, education, literature, and household gods; and that\r\nnot until we have tried things in our old Eastern ways and failed, do we\r\nrealize that we exist under a new and different state of things and slowly\r\nbegin to open our eyes to the existence of Western agricultural reports\r\nand papers giving us the conditions on which the best results have been\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nThere will be more grass seed planted this spring than ever before, and\r\nthe farmers will be guided by the conditions on which the best successes\r\nseem to have been obtained. But this seeding will not give us much grass\r\nfor this coming summer. What must we do? I write for our Western farmers\r\nwho have no clover, orchard grass, blue grass, but have in their\r\ncultivated fields.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRAB GRASS.\r\n\r\nThis grass, the most troublesome weed of the West, smothering our gardens\r\nand converting our growing corn-fields into dense meadows, makes the best\r\nhog pasture in the world, while it lasts. Put hogs into a pasture\r\ncontaining all the tame grasses, with one corner in crab grass, and the\r\nlast named grass will all be consumed before the other grasses are\r\ntouched.\r\n\r\nNot only do they prefer it to any other grass, but on no grass will they\r\nthrive and fatten so well. Last spring I fenced twelve acres of old stalk\r\nground well seeded to crab grass. With the first of June the field was\r\ngreen, and from then until frost pastured sixty large hogs, which, with\r\none ear of corn each, morning and evening, became thoroughly fat. These\r\nwere the finest and cheapest hogs I ever grew.\r\n\r\nThis grass is in its glory from June till frosts. By sowing the ground\r\nearly in oats, this will pasture the hogs until June, when the crab grass\r\nwill occupy all the ground, and carry them through in splendid condition,\r\nand fat them, with an ear or corn morning and evening.     A. D. LEE.\r\nCENTERVILLE, KAN.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Many of our readers may be unfamiliar with the variety of grass\r\nspoken of by our correspondent. It is known as crop grass, crab grass,\r\nwire grass, and crow's foot (_Eleusine Indica_). Flint describes it as\r\nfollows: Stems ascending, flattened, branching at the base; spikes, two to\r\nfive, greenish. It is an annual and flowers through the season, growing\r\nfrom eight to fifteen inches high, and forming a fine green carpeting in\r\nlawns and yards. It is indigenous in Mississippi, Alabama, and adjoining\r\nStates, and serves for hay, grazing, and turning under as a fertilizer. It\r\ngrows there with such luxuriance, in many sections, as never to require\r\nsowing, and yields a good crop where many of the more Northern grasses\r\nwould fail.--[ED. P. F.]\r\n\r\n\r\nA Stock Farm and Ranch.\r\n\r\nSome years ago Prof. J. B. Turner, of Jacksonville, Ill., whom almost\r\nevery reader of THE PRAIRIE FARMER in days gone by knows, personally, or\r\nby his writings, in company with one of his sons conceived the idea of\r\nrunning an Illinois stock farm in connection with a ranch in Texas. The\r\nyoung animals were to be reared on the cheap lands in the latter State\r\nwhere care and attention amount to a trifle, and to ship them North to\r\nfinish them off for market on the blue grass and corn of the Illinois\r\nfarm. To carry out this purpose they purchased nearly 10,000 acres in\r\nColeman county, Texas, and they converted 1,000 acres in a body in\r\nMontgomery county, Illinois, into a home stock farm. Unfortunately, just\r\nas all things were in readiness for extensive operations, the son died,\r\nleaving the business to Prof. Turner, now nearly an octogenarian and\r\nentirely unable to bear the burden thus forced upon him. As a consequence,\r\nhe desires to sell these large and desirable possessions, separate or\r\ntogether, as purchasers may offer.\r\n\r\nThe Illinois farm is well fenced and in a high state of cultivation. There\r\nare growing upon it more than 2,000 large evergreens, giving at once\r\nprotection to stock and beauty to the landscape. There are also 1,500\r\nbearing fruit trees, a vineyard, and a large quantity of raspberries,\r\nblackberries, currants, etc.\r\n\r\nBesides a good farm-house, there is a large barn, in which there are often\r\nfed at one time 150 head of horses, with plenty of room for each animal;\r\nand an abundance of storage room in proportion for grain and hay. Also a\r\nlarge sheep shed, the feeding capacity of which is 3,000 head. Also a\r\nlarge hog house, conveniently divided into pens with bins for grain. Other\r\nnumerous out-buildings, granary, hay sheds, stock and hay scales, etc.,\r\netc. There are on the farm twelve miles of Osage orange hedge, the best\r\nkind of fence in the world, in perfect trim and full growth; and four\r\nmiles of good rail fence, dividing the farm off into conveniently sized\r\nfields of forty, eighty and one hundred and sixty acres each, access to\r\nwhich is easily obtained by means of gates which open from each field into\r\na private central road belonging to the farm, and directly connected with\r\nthe stock yards near the house, so that it is not necessary to pass over\r\nother fields in the handling of stock. Stockmen will appreciate this\r\narrangement. Owing to its special advantages for handling stock, it has\r\nbecome widely known as a \"Model Stock Farm.\" The lands are all naturally\r\nwell drained; no flat or wet land, and by means of natural branches, which\r\nrun through every eighty acres, the whole farm is conveniently and easily\r\nwatered, by an unfailing supply. There are besides three large wind mills,\r\nwith connecting troughs for watering the stock yards and remotest field.\r\nThis supply of stock water has never failed. It is therefore specially\r\nadapted for all kinds of stock raising, and is well stocked. It has on it\r\na fine drove of Hereford cattle and Norman horses, and is otherwise fully\r\nequipped with all the recent improvements in farming implements. This farm\r\nis only about fifty miles from St. Louis, Mo., two miles from a railroad\r\nstation, and six miles from Litchfield, Illinois. Besides its location\r\ncommercially, and its advantages for handling stock, this farm is in one\r\nof the best wheat and fruit producing sections of Illinois, and has now on\r\nit 200 acres of fine wheat.\r\n\r\nThe ranch in Texas consists of one body of 9,136 acres of choice land. By\r\nmeans of an unfailing supply of living water the whole ranch is well\r\nwatered, and has besides a very large cistern. The soil is covered with\r\nthe Curly Mesquite grass, the richest and most nutritious native stock\r\ngrass known in Texas. There is also on the ranch a splendid growth of live\r\noak trees, the leaves of which remain green the year round, furnishing\r\nshade in summer, and an ample protection for stock in winter.\r\n\r\nThere is on the ranch a large well built stone house, and also a fine\r\nsheep shed, with bins for 5,000 bushels of grain. This shed is covered\r\nwith Florida Cypress shingles and affords protection for 2,000 head of\r\nsheep, and can be used just as well for other kinds of stock. Here can be\r\nbred and raised to maturity at a mere nominal cost, all kinds of cattle,\r\nhorses, mules, and other stock, no feed in winter being required beyond\r\nthe natural supply of grass. After the stock reaches maturity they can be\r\nshipped to the Illinois Farm; and while all the cattle easily fatten in\r\nTexas enough for the market, still as they are generally shipped to St.\r\nLouis or Chicago, it costs but little more, and greatly increases the\r\nprofits, to first ship them to the Illinois Farm, and put them in prime\r\ncondition, besides being near the markets, and placing the owner in\r\nposition to take advantage of desirable prices at any time. With horses\r\nand mules this is a special advantage readily apparent to every one.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen at once that any individual with capital, or a stock\r\ncompany, or partnership of two or more men, could run this farm and ranch\r\ntogether at a great profit. All the improvements on both being made solely\r\nfor convenience and profit and not anything expended for useless show.\r\n\r\nI do not write this communication from any selfish motive, for I have not\r\na penny's worth of interest in either farm or ranch, but I want to let\r\npeople who are looking for stock farms know that here is one at hand such\r\nas is seldom found, and at the same time to do my life-long friend and\r\nyours a slight favor in return for the great and lasting benefits he has,\r\nin the past, so freely conferred upon the farmers of the State and\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nI know these lands can be bought far below their real value, and the\r\npurchaser will secure a rare bargain. I presume the Professor will be glad\r\nto correspond with parties, giving full particulars as to terms.\r\n\r\nSUBSCRIBER. MONTGOMERY CO., ILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWestern Wool-Growers.\r\n\r\nThe Western wool-growers, in convention at Denver, Colorado, March 13th,\r\nunanimously adopted the following memorial to Congress:\r\n\r\n     Whereas, The wool-growers of Colorado, Kansas, Utah,\r\n     Wyoming, Nebraska, Idaho, New Mexico, and Minnesota,\r\n     assembled in convention in the city of Denver, the 13th of\r\n     March, 1884, representing 7,500,000 head of sheep,\r\n     $50,000,000 invested capital, and an annual yield of\r\n     35,000,000 pounds of wool, and\r\n\r\n     Whereas, Said Industry having been greatly injured by the\r\n     reduction of the tariff bill of May, 1883, and being\r\n     threatened with total destruction by the reduction of 20\r\n     per cent, as proposed by the Morrison tariff bill just\r\n     reported to the House of Representatives by the Committee\r\n     on Ways and Means; therefore\r\n\r\n     Resolved, That we, the wool-growers in convention\r\n     assembled, are opposed to the provisions of the Morrison\r\n     bill now before Congress which aim to make a further\r\n     reduction of 20 per cent on foreign wools and woolens, and\r\n     that we ask a restoration of the tariff of 1867 in its\r\n     entirety as relates to wools and woolens, by which, for the\r\n     first time in the industrial history of the country,\r\n     equitable relations were established between the duties on\r\n     wool and those on woolen goods.\r\n\r\n     Resolved, That we pledge ourselves to work for and to aid\r\n     in the restoration of the tariff of 1867 on wools and\r\n     woolens, and request all persons engaged or interested in\r\n     the wool-growing industry to co-operate with us.\r\n\r\n     Resolved, That we as wool-growers and citizens pledge\r\n     ourselves to stand by all committees and associations in\r\n     giving full and complete protection to all American\r\n     industries in need of the same, and cordially invite their\r\n     co-operation in this matter.\r\n\r\nThe memorial concludes with an appeal to Western Senators and\r\nRepresentatives in Congress to do all in their power to restore the tariff\r\nof 1867.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cattle Disease Near Effingham.\r\n\r\nSaturday, March 15, I visited the herds of Messrs. Du Brouck, Schooley and\r\nFannce northeast of Effingham, Illinois, and carefully examined them with\r\nMr. F. F. Hunt, of the university, as they were reported affected with\r\nfoot-and-mouth disease. In each herd diseased cattle were found; about 20\r\ndistinctly marked cases, a few others having symptoms. The disease is\r\nunlike anything I have known, but does not resemble foot-and-mouth disease\r\nas described by any authority. Only the hind feet are affected, and these\r\nwithout ulceration. In most cases \"scouring\" was first noticed, followed\r\nby swelling above the hoofs. In the most severe cases, the skin cracked\r\nabout the pastern joint or at the coronet. In four cases one foot had come\r\noff. Swelling of pastern and \"scouring\" were the only symptoms in several\r\ncases. The mouth and udders were healthful; appetites good. In one case\r\nthere was slight vesicle on nostril and slight inflammation of gum. Some\r\nanimals in contact with diseased ones for weeks remained healthful. Others\r\nwere attacked after five weeks' isolation. The most marked cases were of\r\neight to ten weeks standing. But one animal had died.\r\n\r\nWhat we saw is not foot and mouth disease as known abroad, nor is the\r\ncontagious character of the disease proven from the cases in these herds.\r\n\r\nG. E. MORROW, UNIVERSITY, CHAMPAIGN, ILL.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Dairy]\r\n\r\nDairymen, Write for Your Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nCamembert Cheese.\r\n\r\nThe Camembert is one of the variety of French cheeses that find ready sale\r\nin England at high prices. Mr. Jenkins describes the process of making\r\nthis cheese in a late number of the Journal of the Royal Agricultural\r\nSociety of England which information we find condensed in the Dublin\r\nFarmer's Gazette:\r\n\r\nThe cows are milked three times a day, at 4.30 and 11.30 a. m., and at 6\r\np. m. In most dairies the evening's milk is highly skimmed in the morning,\r\nbutter being made from the cream, and the milk divided into two portions\r\none of which is added to the morning's and the other to the midday's\r\nmilking. The mixture is immediately put into earthen vessels holding\r\ntwelve to fifteen gallons each, and after it has been raised to the\r\ntemperature of about 86 deg. Fahr., a sufficient quantity of rennet is\r\nadded to make the curd fit to be transferred to the cheese moulds in three\r\nor four hours, or, perhaps, a longer interval in winter. The mixture of\r\nthe rennet with the milk is insured by gentle stirring, and the pots are\r\nthen covered with a square board. The curd is ready for removal when it\r\ndoes not adhere to the back of the finger placed gently upon it, and when\r\nthe liquid that runs from the fingers is as nearly as possible colorless.\r\nThe curd is transferred, without breaking it more than can be avoided, to\r\nperforated moulds four inches in diameter. The moulds are placed on reed\r\nmats resting on slightly inclined slabs, made of slate, cement, or other\r\nhard material, and having a gutter near the outer edge. The curd remains\r\nin the moulds twenty-four or even forty-eight hours, according to the\r\nseason, being turned upside down after twelve or twenty-four hours; that\r\nis, when sufficiently drained at the bottom. After turning the face of the\r\ncheese, the inside of the mould is sprinkled with salt, and twelve hours\r\nafterward the opposite face and the rim of the cheeses are treated in the\r\nsame way. The cheeses are then placed on movable shelves round the walls\r\nof the dairy for a day or two, after which the curing process commences by\r\nthe cheeses being transferred to the \"drying-room,\" and there placed on\r\nshelves made of narrow strips of wood with narrow intervals between them,\r\nor of ordinary planks with reed mats or clean rye straw. Here the greatest\r\ningenuity is exerted to secure as dry an atmosphere and as equable a\r\ntemperature as possible--the windows being numerous and small, and fitted\r\nwith glass, to exclude air, but not light, when the glass is shut, with a\r\nwooden shutter to exclude both light and air; and with wire gauze to admit\r\nlight and air, and exclude flies and winged insects, which are troublesome\r\nto the makers of soft cheese.\r\n\r\nThe cheeses are turned at first once a day, and afterward every second\r\nday, unless in damp weather, when daily turning is absolutely necessary.\r\nIn three or four days after the cheeses are placed in the drying-room they\r\nbecome speckled; in another week they are covered with a thick crop of\r\nwhite mold, which by degrees deepens to a dark yellow, the outside of the\r\ncheese becoming less and less sticky. At the end of about a month, when\r\nthe cheese no longer sticks to the fingers, it is taken to the finishing\r\nroom, where light is nearly excluded, and the atmosphere is kept very\r\nstill and slightly damp. Here they remain three or four weeks, being\r\nturned every day or every second day, according to the season, and\r\ncarefully examined periodically. When ready for market--that is to say, in\r\nwinter, when ripe, and in summer, when half ripe--they are made up in\r\npackets of six, by means of straw and paper, with great skill and\r\nneatness.\r\n\r\n\r\nFew Words and More Butter.\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin Dairymen's Association last year offered prizes for the best\r\nessays on butter-making, the essays not to exceed 250 words. Competition\r\nwas active, and many valuable little treatises was the result. The first\r\nprize was won by D. W. Curtis, of Fort Atkinson, and reads as follows. We\r\ncommend it to all butter-makers and to all writers of essays as a model of\r\nthe boiled-down essence of brevity:\r\n\r\nCOWS.\r\n\r\nSelect cows rich in butter-making qualities.\r\n\r\nFEED.\r\n\r\nPastures should be dry, free from slough-holes, well seeded with different\r\nkinds of tame grasses, so that good feed is assured. If timothy or clover,\r\ncut early and cure properly. Feed corn, stalks, pumpkins, ensilage and\r\nplenty of vegetables in winter.\r\n\r\nGRAIN.\r\n\r\nCorn and oats, corn and bran, oil meal in small quantities.\r\n\r\nWATER.\r\n\r\nLet cows drink only such water as you would yourself.\r\n\r\nCARE OF COWS.\r\n\r\nGentleness and cleanliness.\r\n\r\nMILKING.\r\n\r\nBrush the udder to free it from impurities. Milk in a clean barn, well\r\nventilated, quickly, cheerfully, with clean hands and pail. Seldom change\r\nmilkers.\r\n\r\nCARE OF MILK.\r\n\r\nStrain while warm; submerge in water 48 degrees. Open setting 60 degrees.\r\n\r\nSKIMMING.\r\n\r\nSkim at twelve hours; at twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nCARE OF CREAM.\r\n\r\nCare must be exercised to ripen cream by frequent stirrings, keeping at 60\r\ndegrees until slightly sour.\r\n\r\nUTENSILS.\r\n\r\nBetter have one cow less than be without a thermometer. Churns without\r\ninside fixtures. Lever butter worker. Keep sweet and clean.\r\n\r\nCHURNING.\r\n\r\nStir the cream thoroughly; temper to 60 degrees; warm or cool with water.\r\nChurn immediately when properly soured, slowly at first, with regular\r\nmotion, in 40 to 60 minutes. When butter is formed in granules the size of\r\nwheat kernels, draw off the buttermilk; wash with cold water and brine\r\nuntil no trace of buttermilk is left.\r\n\r\nWORKING AND SALTING.\r\n\r\nLet the water drain out; weigh the butter; salt, one ounce to the pound;\r\nsift salt on the butter, and work with lever worker. Set away two to four\r\nhours; lightly re-work and pack.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MACHINE that can take hay, corn fodder, grass, and grain and manufacture\r\nthem into good, rich milk at the rate of a quart per hour for every hour\r\nin the twenty-four, is a valuable one and should be well cared for. There\r\nare machines--cows--which have done this. There are many thousands of them\r\nthat will come well up to this figure for several months in the year, and\r\nwhich will, besides, through another system of organisms, turn out a calf\r\nevery year to perpetuate the race of machines. Man has it in his power to\r\nincrease the capacity of the cow for milk and the milk for cream. He must\r\nfurnish the motive power, the belts, and the oil in the form of proper\r\nfood, shelter, and kindly treatment. By withholding these he throws the\r\nentire machinery out of gear and robs himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCompiled Correspondence.\r\n\r\n\r\nKANE COUNTY, MARCH 17.--Snow is nearly all gone. There is but little frost\r\nin the ground. The spring birds have come. Hay is plenty, winter wheat and\r\nwinter rye look green, and have not been winter-killed to any great\r\nextent. Cattle and horses are looking well and are free from disease. We\r\nfear the spread of the foot-and-mouth disease. Every effort should be made\r\nto confine it within its present limits. Its spread in this county of so\r\ngreat dairy interests would be a great calamity. Our factory men will make\r\nfull cream cheese during the summer months. The hard, skim cheese made\r\nlast season, and sold at 2 cts per pound, paid the patrons nothing. We\r\nhear of factory dividends for January of $1.60 to $1.66.     J. P.

The disease\r\npasses through four different stages or periods; but for present purposes\r\nit will be sufficient to merely mention the most prominent of the\r\nsuccessive changes and appearances, as they occur to the ordinary\r\nobserver. The incubatory stage, or the time between contamination and the\r\ndevelopment of the disease, is very short (from twenty-four hours to one\r\nor two weeks), and the disease is ushered in by the general symptoms of\r\nfever, such as shivering, increased temperature, staring coat, dry muzzle,\r\ndullness and loss of appetite. The animals seek seclusion, preferably in\r\nsheltered places, where they assume a crouched position, or lie down, and\r\nthere is more or less stiffness and unwillingness to move. The mouth\r\nbecomes hot and inflamed looking, and covered with slime, the breath\r\nfetid; the animal grinds the teeth, smacks with mouth, and has difficulty\r\nin swallowing. There is more or less tenderness of feet and lameness, and\r\nin cows the udder becomes red and tender, the teats swollen, and they\r\nrefuse to be milked. Depending upon the intensity of the fever and the\r\nextent to which the udder is affected, the milk secretion will be more or\r\nless diminished, or entirely suspended; but throughout the disease the\r\nquality or constituents of the milk become materially altered; its color\r\nchanges to a yellow; it has a tendency to rapid decomposition, and\r\npossesses virulent properties. Soon yellowish-white blisters, of various\r\nsizes, from that of a small pea to a small hickory nut, appear on the\r\nmucous surface within the mouth, and which blisters often in the course of\r\ndevelopment become confluent or coalesce. They generally break within two\r\nto three days, and leave bright red, uneven, and ragged sores or ulcers,\r\nto the edges of which adheres shreds of detached epithelial tissue. The\r\nanimal now constantly moves the tongue and smacks the mouth, while more or\r\nless copious and viscid saliva continually dribbles from the mouth. The\r\nlameness increases in proportion as the feet are affected, and if the fore\r\nfeet are most affected, the animal walks much like a floundered horse,\r\nwith the hinder limbs advanced far under the body, and with arched back.\r\nThe coronet of the claws, especially toward the heels, becomes swollen,\r\nhot, and tender, causing the animal to lie down most of the time. The\r\nblisters, which appear at the interdigital space of the claws, and\r\nespecially at the heels, break in the course of a day and discharge a\r\nthick, straw-colored fluid; the ulcers, which are of intensely red or\r\nscarlet color, soon become covered with exudating lymph, which dries and\r\nforms scabs. On the udder, the blisters appear more or less scattered and\r\nvariable, and they are most numerous at the base and on the teats.\r\nOrdinarily, the disease terminates in two or three weeks, while the\r\nanimal, which during its progress refuses to partake of any other than\r\nsloppy food, gradually regains strength and flesh, and the udder resumes\r\nits normal functions. The mortality at times has proved very great in this\r\ndisease when it has appeared with unusual virulency.\r\n\r\n\r\nShyness and Timidity.\r\n\r\nIn common \"horse language,\" these propensities are confounded one with the\r\nother or else no proper and right distinction is made between them. A\r\nhorse may be timid without being shy, though he can hardly be said to be\r\nshy without being timid. Young horses in their breaking are timid,\r\nfrightened at every fresh or strange object they see. They stand gazing\r\nand staring at objects they have not seen before, fearful to approach\r\nthem; but they do not run away from, or shy at them; on the contrary, the\r\nmoment they are convinced there is nothing hurtful in them, they refuse\r\nnot to approach or even trample upon them. This the shy horse will not do.\r\nHe can not be persuaded to turn toward or even to look at the object he\r\nshies at; much less to approach it.\r\n\r\nTimid horses, through usage and experience, get the better of their\r\ntimidity, and in time become very opposite to fearful; but shy horses,\r\nunless worked down to fatigue and broken-spiritedness, rarely forget their\r\nold sins. The best way to treat them is to work them, day by day,\r\nmoderately for hours together, taking no notice whatever of their shying\r\ntricks, neither caressing nor chastising them, and on no account whatever\r\nendeavoring to turn their heads either towards or away from the objects\r\nshied at.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlanders.\r\n\r\nWith a view of shedding light on the important question of the\r\ncontagiousness of glanders, we will mention the following deductions from\r\nfacts brought forth by our own experience.\r\n\r\n1. That farcy and glanders, which constitute the same disease, are\r\npropagable through the medium of stabling, and this we believe to be the\r\nmore usual way in which the disease is communicated from horse to horse.\r\n\r\n2. That infected stabling may harbor and retain the infection for months,\r\nor even years; and though, by thoroughly cleansing and making use of\r\ncertain disinfecting means, the contagion may probably be destroyed, it\r\nwould not perhaps be wise to occupy such stables _immediately_ after such\r\nsupposed or alleged disinfection.\r\n\r\n3.

Already we have many trees in Iowa mulched with\r\nsand.\r\n\r\nI wish now to draw attention to the fact that on the rich black prairie\r\nsoils west of Saratov--about five hundred miles southeast of Moscow--every\r\ntree in the profitable commercial orchards is mulched with pure river\r\nsand. The crown of the tree when planted is placed about six inches lower\r\nthan usual with us in a sort of basin, about sixteen feet across. This\r\nbasin is then filled in with sand so that in the center, where the tree\r\nstands, it is three or four inches higher than the general level of the\r\nsoil. The spaces between these slight depressions filled with sand are\r\nseeded down to grass, which is not cut, but at time of fruit gathering is\r\nflattened by brushing to make a soft bed for the dropping fruit and for a\r\nwinter mulch.\r\n\r\nThe close observer will not fail to notice good reasons for this\r\ntreatment. (1.) The sand mulch maintains an even temperature and moisture\r\nof the surface roots and soil and prevents a rapid evaporation of the\r\nmoisture coming up by capillary attraction from the sub soil.\r\n\r\n(2.) The soil under the sand will not freeze as deeply as on exposed\r\nsurfaces, and we were told that it would not freeze as deeply by two feet\r\nor more as under the tramped grass in the interspaces.\r\n\r\n(3.) With the light colored sand about the trees, and grass between, the\r\nlower beds of air among the trees would not be as hot by several degrees\r\nas the exposed surface, even when the soil was light colored clay.\r\n\r\n(4.) A bed of sand around the trunks of the trees will close in with the\r\nmovement of the top by the summer and autumn winds, thus avoiding the\r\nserious damage often resulting from the swaying of the trunk making an\r\nopening in the soil for water to settle and freeze.\r\n\r\nStill another use is made of this sand in very dry seasons, which as with\r\nus would often fail to carry the fruit to perfection. On the upper side of\r\nlarge commercial orchards, large cisterns are constructed which are filled\r\nby a small steam pump. When it is decided that watering is needed the sand\r\nis drawn out, making a sort of circus ring around the trees which is run\r\nfull of water by putting on an extra length of V spouting for each tree.\r\nWhen one row is finished the conductors are passed over to next row as\r\nneeded. To water an orchard of 1,200 trees--after the handy fixtures are\r\nonce provided--seems but a small task. After the water settles away, the\r\nsand is returned to its place.\r\n\r\nIn the Province of Saratov we saw orchards with and without the sand, and\r\nwith and without the watering. We did not need to ask if the systematic\r\nmanagement paid. The great crops of smooth apples and pears, and the long\r\nlived and perfect trees on the mulched and watered orchards told the whole\r\nstory of the needs of trees planted on black soil on an open plain subject\r\nto extreme variations as to moisture and temperature of air and soil.\r\n\r\nJ. L. BUDD., IOWA AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nPear Blight.--No. 2.\r\n\r\nThe mere \"experience\" of an individual, whether as a doctor of medicine,\r\nhorticulture, or agriculture--however extensive, is comparatively\r\nworthless. Indeed the million \"demonstrate it to be mischievous, judging\r\nfrom the success of quacks and empyrics as to money. An unlimited number\r\nof facts and certificates prove nothing, either as to cause or remedy.\"\r\n\r\nSir Isaac Newton's corpuscular theory \"explained all the phenomena of\r\nlight, except one,\" and he actually assumed, for it \"fits.\" Nevertheless\r\nit will ever remain the most thinkable mode of teaching the laws of light,\r\nand it is not probable that any more than this will ever be accomplished\r\nas to any natural science--if that can be called science about which we\r\nmust admit that \"it is not so; but it is as if it were so.\"\r\n\r\nOf more than 300 \"Osband Summer\" which I grafted on the Anger quince\r\nsuccessfully, one remains, and this one was transplanted after they had\r\nfruited in a clay soil, to the same sort of soil between \"the old\r\nstandard\" and a stable, both of which have occupied the same locality and\r\nwithin twenty yards, during much more than fifty years of my own\r\nobservation--this \"Osband Summer\" flourishes. It has borne fruit in its\r\npresent site, but grew so rapidly last year that the blossoms aborted thus\r\nillustrating the large proportion of vital force necessary to the\r\nproduction of fruit, as the site has a perennial supply of manure from the\r\nold stable. A number of standard trees, of the same variety, developed\r\nbeautifully until they attained twenty or thirty feet, but then succumbed\r\nto the blight, after the first effort at fruiting. So also the Beurre\r\nClairgean etc., etc. Their exposure to the same influences, and their\r\ngrowth during several years did not occasion the blight, but the debility\r\nwhich must inevitably attend fruiting seems the most prolific cause.\r\n\r\nAll the phenomena of pear blight can be accounted for, and we are greatly\r\nencouraged in protecting the trees therefrom if, we assume, it is only the\r\nresult of weakness and deficient vitality; if so, as in epidemics, all the\r\npear trees may be poisoned or ergotized, but only the weakest succumb; and\r\nperhaps this debility may be confined to one limb. The practical value of\r\nthis view is manifest, as it is impracticable to avoid using the same\r\nknife, and remove every blighted leaf from the orchard. Moreover, if the\r\nlimb is a large one, its prompt removal shocks the vitality of the whole\r\ntree[1] and thus renders other parts more vulnerable. On the contrary\r\nview, the limb may be allowed to drop by natural process, precisely as all\r\ntrees in a forest shed their lower limbs, leaving hardly a cicatrice or\r\nscar, and this may be insured at any season by a cord of hemp twine,\r\nfirmly bound around the limb. The inevitable strangulation, and the\r\nhealing of the stump (without the mycelium of fungi which the knife or saw\r\ninevitably propagates by exposing a denuded surface, if not more directly)\r\nproceed more rapidly than the natural slough of limbs by starvation.\r\nMoreover the fruit may mature on such limbs during their strangulation, as\r\nthis may not be perfected before the subsequent winter.\r\n\r\nThe next practical result of my view is the fundamental importance of all\r\nthose means which are calculated to husband the vital force of the tree\r\nduring its first effort to fruit; one of these is the use of a soil that\r\nwill not produce more than twenty bushels of corn without manure, thus a\r\nlarge proportion of the setts will be aborted, but one half of what\r\nremains should be removed, and subsequently the area beneath the limbs\r\nshould have a wheelbarrow of good compost.     D. S.\r\n\r\n  Footnote 1: NOTE.--The shock as to vital force is\r\n     demonstrated by the fact that when young trees are not\r\n     trimmed at all their girth increases more rapidly, and they\r\n     bear fruit sooner. Moreover, when old trees are severely\r\n     pruned (though not half the proportion of wood is removed)\r\n     they fail to bear during the next year. I find that a hemp\r\n     cord about the size of the stem of a tobacco pipe\r\n     (one-fourth inch diameter) will soon become imbedded in the\r\n     bark if firmly tied around a limb, and perhaps this size is\r\n     more efficient than a thicker cord.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Black Walnut.\r\n\r\nThe black walnut is without doubt the most valuable tree we have for the\r\nrich lands of the \"corn belt,\" West, and one which is very easily grown\r\neverywhere if the farmer will only learn how to get it started. How few we\r\nsee growing on our prairies. Why? Simply because to have it we must grow\r\nit from the nuts. It is nearly impossible to transplant black walnut trees\r\nof any size and have them live; although it is a fact that whenever a\r\nnon-professional attempts to grow them from the nuts he is almost sure to\r\nfail, it is also a fact that there is no tree that is more easily grown\r\nfrom the seed than this, if we only know how to do it.\r\n\r\nIt is my purpose in this note to tell how to do it, and also how not to do\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn the first instance we will suppose a man lives where he can gather the\r\nnuts in the woods. When the nuts begin to fall let him plow deeply the\r\nplot of ground he wishes to plant and furrow it off three or four inches\r\ndeep, the distance apart he wishes his rows to be. He will then go to the\r\nwoods and gather what nuts he wishes to plant, and plant them at once,\r\njust as they come from the tree, covering them just out of sight in the\r\nfurrows. This is all there is of it; simple, is it not? But it will not do\r\nto gather a great wagon box full, and let them stand in it until they\r\nheat, or to throw them in a great heap on the ground and let them lay\r\nthere until they heat. It will not do, either, to hull them and let them\r\nlay in the sun a week or two, or hull them, dry them and keep them until\r\nspring, and then plant; none of these plans will do if you want trees. Of\r\ncourse if the nuts are hulled and planted at once they will grow; but this\r\nhulling is entirely unnecessary. Besides, the hulls seem to act as a\r\nspecial manure for the young seedlings, causing them to grow more\r\nvigorously.\r\n\r\nNext, we will suppose one wishes to plant walnuts where they can not be\r\nhad from the woods, but must be shipped in. There seems to be only one\r\nplan by which this can be done safely every time, which is as follows:\r\nGather the nuts as they fall from the trees--of course when they begin to\r\nfall naturally all may be shaken down at once--and spread them not over a\r\nfoot deep, on the bare ground under the shade of trees. Cover out of sight\r\nwith straw or leaves, with some sticks to hold in place called a \"rot\r\nheap;\" then after they are frozen and will stay so, they may be shipped in\r\nbags, boxes, barrels, or in bulk by the car-load, and then, again, placed\r\nin \"rot heaps,\" as above, until so early in the spring as the soil is in\r\nworkable condition. Then plant as directed in the fall, except the soil\r\nshould be firmly packed around the nuts. Keep free from weeds by good\r\ncultivation, and in due time you will have a splendid grove.\r\n\r\nThere was an immense crop of walnuts in this district last fall, and\r\nthousands of bushels were put up carefully, in this way, all ready for\r\nshipment before the weather became warm; many more thousands were planted\r\nto grow seedlings from, for, notwithstanding the walnut transplants poorly\r\nwhen of considerable size, the one year seedlings transplant with as\r\nlittle loss as the average trees.\r\n\r\nThere is no tree better adapted for planting to secure timber claims with\r\nthan the black walnut, and none more valuable when the timber is grown.\r\nFor this purpose the land should be plowed deeply, then harrowed to\r\nfineness and firmness, and furrowed out in rows four, six, eight, or ten\r\nfeet apart. The nuts may then be planted as directed. It is best to plant\r\nthickly in the rows, then if too thick they can be thinned out,\r\ntransplanting the thinnings, or selling them to the neighbors. They should\r\nbe thoroughly cultivated, until large enough to shade the ground, and\r\nthinned out as necessary as they grow larger. A walnut grove thoroughly\r\ncultivated the first ten years will grow at least twenty feet high, while\r\none not cultivated at all would only grow two to three feet in that time.\r\n\r\nD. B. WIER., LACON, ILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes on Current Topics.\r\n\r\nARBOR DAY.\r\n\r\nWhy can not Illinois have an Arbor Day as well as Nebraska, or any other\r\nState. There ought to be ten millions of trees planted the coming spring\r\nwithin its borders--saying nothing of orchard trees--by the roadside, on\r\nlawns, for shade, for wind breaks, for shelter, for mechanical purposes,\r\nand for climatic amelioration. Nearly all our towns and villages need more\r\ntrees along the streets or in parks; thousands of our farms are suffering\r\nfor them; hundreds of cemeteries would be beautified by them, and\r\nnumberless homes would be rendered more pleasant and homelike by an\r\naddition of one, two, or a dozen, to their bleak places. Can not THE\r\nPRAIRIE FARMER start a boom that will lead to the establishment of an\r\nArbor Day all over the State? Why not? There is yet time.\r\n\r\nHOT-BEDS.\r\n\r\nFor the benefit of those who can not command the usual appliances for\r\nhot-beds, I will say that they can be made so as to answer a good purpose\r\nvery cheaply. Take a nice sunny spot that is covered with a sod, if to be\r\nhad. Dig off the sod in squares and pile them carefully on the north side\r\nand the ends of the pit, to form the sides of the bed, with a proper\r\nslope. The soil thrown out from the bottom may be banked up against the\r\nsods as a protection. After the bed is finished, the whole may be covered\r\nwith boards, to turn the water off. These answer in the place of glass\r\nframes. As the main use for a hot-bed is to secure bottom heat, very good\r\nresults can be obtained in these cheaply constructed affairs. After the\r\nseeds are up, and when the weather will permit, the boards must be removed\r\nto give light and air--but replaced at night and before a rain. Of course,\r\nwhere large quantities of plants are to be grown, of tender as well as\r\nhardy sorts, it would be better and safer to go to the expense of board\r\nframes and glass for covering.\r\n\r\nDON'T DO IT.\r\n\r\nOf course, all the peach trees, and many of the other stone fruits, and\r\nmost of the blackberry and raspberry plants, will show discoloration of\r\nwood when the spring opens--so much so that many will pronounce them\r\ndestroyed, and will proceed to cut them away. Don't do it. Peaches have\r\noften been thus injured, and by judicious handling saved to bear crops for\r\nyears afterward. But they will need to be thoroughly cut back. Trees of\r\nsix or seven years old I have cut down so as to divest them of nearly all\r\ntheir heads, when those heads seemed badly killed, and had them throw out\r\nnew heads, that made large growth and bore good crops the following\r\nseason. Cut them back judiciously, and feed them well, but don't destroy\r\nthem. And so with the berry plants. Wait and see, before you destroy.\r\n\r\nPEARS FROM RUSSIA.\r\n\r\nNo one who reads Prof. Budd's articles on Russian Pears, can fail to be\r\ninterested and struck with the prospect of future successful pear culture\r\nin the United States. It is highly probable that Russia is yet to give us\r\na class of that fruit that will withstand the rigors of our climate. But\r\nhow is this to be accomplished? Individual enterprise can, and doubtless\r\nwill, accomplish much in that direction; but the object seems to me to be\r\nof sufficient importance to justify State or National action. The great\r\nState of Illinois might possibly add millions to her resources by giving\r\nmaterial aid in the furtherance of this purpose--and a liberal expenditure\r\nby the General Government, through the Department of Agriculture, or the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society, would be more usefully applied than many\r\nother large sums annually voted. At all events, another season of fruitage\r\nought not to be allowed to pass without some concerted action for the\r\npurpose of testing the question.\r\n\r\nSome of our strongest nurserymen will likely be moving in the work, but\r\nthat will not be enough. The propagator of that fruit, however, who will\r\nsucceed in procuring from the European regions a variety of pears that\r\nwill fill the bill required by the necessities of our soil and climate,\r\nhas a fortune at his command.\r\n\r\nOLD WINTER\r\n\r\nlingers in the lap of spring, truly, this year of grace, 1884. Here it is\r\nthe 10th of March, and for over one hundred days we have had\r\nwinter--winter; but very few real mild and bright days, such as we had\r\n\"when I was a boy.\" The Mississippi is frozen over still, with no signs of\r\nbreaking up, and men, women, and children are sighing for sunshine and\r\nshowers, and daisies and violets. The wood and coal bills have been\r\nenormous; the pigs squeal in the open pens, and cattle roam, as usual,\r\nshivering in the lanes and along the streets. The song of a robin\r\nto-morrow morning would be a joyous sound to hear.   T. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrunings.\r\n\r\nTree-worship among the ancients had a most important influence on the\r\npreservation of forests in circumscribed places. Beautiful groves, which\r\nwould otherwise have been sacrificed on the altar of immediate utility,\r\nwere preserved by the religious respect for trees.--Milwaukee Sentinel.\r\n\r\nF. K. Phoenix. \"Small trees have larger roots in proportion, (2) they cost\r\nless, (3) expressage of freight is less--expressing small trees is usually\r\ncheaper than freighting large ones, and then so much more speedy, (4) less\r\nlabor handling, digging holes, etc., (5) less exposed to high winds which\r\nloosen roots, and kill many transplanted trees, (6) planters can form\r\nheads and train them to their own liking, (7) with good care in, say five\r\nyears, they will overtake the common larger sized trees. Without good\r\ncare, better not plant any size.\"\r\n\r\nThe coming currant is Fay's Prolific. It originated with Lincoln Fay, of\r\nChautauqua county, N. Y. For many years he endeavored to raise a currant\r\nthat would combine the size of the Cherry currant with the productiveness\r\nof the Victoria. To this end he fertilized one with the pollen of the\r\nother, and raised some thousands of seedlings, from out of which he\r\nselected this as the one that most nearly realized his desires. It is now\r\nsixteen years since this seedling was obtained. For some eight or nine\r\nyears Mr. Fay tested this variety by the side of all the sorts in\r\ncultivation, until becoming convinced of its superiority in several\r\nparticulars over any of these, he planted it extensively for his own\r\nmarketing.\r\n\r\nAt a late meeting of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society, the currant\r\nworm came in for a good deal of talk. Mr. Satterthwaite said that\r\nhellebore, as we have often printed, was the most effectual \"remedy.\" He\r\nmixed it with water and applied it with a brush or whisk of straw. If not\r\nwashed off by rain for twenty-four hours and used every year, the worms\r\nwere easily got rid of. Mr. Saunders, Superintendent of the Government\r\nGardens at Washington, and a gentleman thoroughly conversant with every\r\nbranch of horticulture, said that there was nothing so effectual with\r\ninsects as London purple, and, though equally poisonous as Paris green,\r\nwas much cheaper. Tobacco stems and refuse have also been found of great\r\nvalue in fruit culture. Pyrethrum, he said, would also kill all sorts of\r\nleaf-eating insects; it is now largely cultivated in California, and is\r\nhardy at least as far north as Washington.\r\n\r\nJOSIAH HOOPES in New York Tribune: In Eastern Pennsylvania and New Jersey,\r\nwhere, literally, no pears have been grown of late years, the Kieffer is\r\ndoing well. I know of no fruit so variable. I ate specimens last season\r\nfinely flavored and delicious; again when they were weak and watery. This\r\nfruit needs thinning on the trees and careful ripening in the house. Don't\r\nunderstand me to say that Kieffer is \"best of all.\" But here it is the\r\nmost profitable for market that I know of, as this is not a pear country,\r\nas are portions of New York State. As we go further south the Kieffer\r\nseems to improve, and I think Mr. Berckmans, of Georgia, will give it a\r\ngood name with him. Yes, the Kieffer will command a higher price in\r\nPhiladelphia than any other pear, and we think some people there know what\r\ngood fruit is. Don't imagine I have any axe on the grindstone in this\r\nmatter; pecuniarily the Kieffer is no more to me than the Bartlett or\r\ndozens of other varieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLORICULTURE]\r\n\r\nSome New Plants.\r\n\r\n\r\nABUTILON THOMSONII PLENA.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is one of the peculiarities of plant culture, that after a certain\r\nnumber of years of cultivation, any plant having the properties of\r\nsporting freely, that is, changing greatly from the original wild\r\ncharacter of the plant, will become double. In most cases it first arises\r\nfrom seed, but with the plant under notice it appears that it was what is\r\ncalled a bud variation, that is, that from some freak of a particular\r\nbranch of a plant of the well-known A. Thomsonii, the ordinary single\r\nflowers were found to be double. This happening on a plant under the eye\r\nof a professional florist was taken off the plant and rooted, and at once\r\nbecame its established character. This phenomena of variation being\r\n\"fixed\" by separate propagation, is by no means rare, and not a few of our\r\nchoice fruits, flowers, and vegetables had their origin by the same means.\r\nIt remains to be seen whether in this case it will be of much value except\r\nas a curiosity, it having precisely the same leaf markings as the\r\noriginal, which are a very distinct yellow mottling of the leaf in a field\r\nof green, and for which the plant is valuable alone, the flowers being\r\nquite of a secondary character. The flowers are said to be perfectly\r\ndouble, resembling in form a double hollyhock, color deep orange, shaded\r\nand streaked with crimson. This is the first year it has been sent out,\r\nand we shall not be surprised if it is soon followed by others, for\r\nusually, when the \"double\" condition of things has arrived no one has a\r\nmonopoly of the curiosity.\r\n\r\n\r\nALTERNANTHERA AUREA NANA.\r\n\r\nThis is a charming new plant of decided merit to the carpet style of\r\nbedding or edging, being very compact in growth, easily kept to a line of\r\nthe finest character, and producing what is of great importance in the\r\nsummer, a line of golden yellow. At times the old kind, A. aurea, would\r\ncome very good, but more often it had far too much of a green shade to\r\nfurnish the contrast sought after, and, as a result, failed to bring out\r\nthe effect the planter studied to produce. It is a fitting companion to A.\r\namabilis, A. paronychioides, and A. versicolor, and will be hailed with\r\ndelight by our park florists and other scientific planters.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOUVARDIA THOMAS MEEHAN.\r\n\r\nHere we have a double scarlet bouvardia from the same raisers, Nanz and\r\nNeuner, that astonished the floral world a few years back, with the double\r\nwhite B. Alfred Neuner. This new addition, unlike the old, which was\r\nanother \"bud variation,\" was secured by a cross between the old B.\r\nleiantha, scarlet with a single flower, and Alfred Neuner, double white.\r\nIf this is the real origin of the kind, which we somewhat doubt, for if\r\nour theory is correct, that a certain amount of cultivation predisposes to\r\ndouble variation, then it is not necessary to cross the double, which in\r\nfact can not be done with a perfectly double flower--the organs of\r\nfructification being wanting with that of a single and seed-producing\r\nkind, to account for the origin of a new double.\r\n\r\nAs is well known the old leiantha is one of the best scarlets yet, and\r\nthis new candidate for favor is said to unite the brilliant color and\r\nprofuse blooming qualities of the old favorite B. leiantha with the\r\nperfect double flowers of B. Alfred Neuner.\r\n\r\nThere are now of this class of plants the three colors--white, scarlet,\r\nand pink--in double as well as single; for instance, a pink President\r\nGarfield sported from and was \"fixed\" from the white A. Neuner, a year or\r\ntwo ago.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATICE SUWOROWII REGAL.\r\n\r\nIn this we have a right regal plant. We first heard of it from the German\r\ncatalogues, early in the past winter. This plant is now offered for sale\r\nby the florists of this country. Its description from the catalogues is as\r\nfollows: \"One of the finest novelties in the list of showy annuals lately\r\nintroduced. Its branching flower spikes, of a very bright rose, with a\r\ncrimson shade, appear successively from ten to fifteen on each plant, and\r\nmeasure, each, fully fifteen to eighteen inches in height, and from\r\none-half to one inch in breadth; the foliage, laying flat on the ground,\r\nis comparatively small, and completely hidden by the numerous flower\r\nspikes, each leaf being five inches long, and from one-half to two inches\r\nbroad, undulated and glaucous. It is constantly in bloom during the summer\r\nand autumn, and when in full bloom is a truly magnificent sight, being one\r\nmass of flowers.\" This class of plants are great favorites, and we should\r\njudge by the colored flowers and description that this variety is a\r\ndecided novelty.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEA ROSES, WHITE BON SILENE.\r\n\r\nThis is another new aspirant for favor, and comes out with the high\r\nsounding character of being in a white what the old Bon Silene is as a red\r\nwinter tea rose. The description from the catalogue is: \"The buds are\r\nlarger and more double than its parent (the red B. S.) and will produce\r\nmore flower buds than any other white rose in cultivation.\"\r\n\r\nIt was raised by Francis Morat, of Louisville, Ky., four years ago; it is\r\nalso a \"sport,\" and from the old B. silene. Should it retain the good\r\nflowering qualities, fragrance, and substance of the original kind, with a\r\npure white bud, it will very soon work its way into popular favor. Usually\r\na white variation has not the vitality that its colored progenitor had, so\r\nthat we say, wait and see.

It is estimated that during the sessions of Congress\r\ntwenty-five thousand people, whose homes are in various parts of this and\r\nother countries, make this city their place of residence. Some come here,\r\nattracted by the advantages the city offers for making the acquaintance of\r\npublic men; others have various claims which they wish to present, while\r\nthe great majority gather here, as crows flock to the carrion, for the\r\nsole purpose of getting a morsel at the public crib. The latter class, as\r\na general thing, originate the many schemes which terminate in vicious\r\nbills, all of which are either directed at the public treasury or toward\r\nthat revenue which the black-mailing of corporations or private\r\nenterprises may bring.\r\n\r\nWhile walking down Pennsylvania avenue the other day I met Mr. William M.\r\nAshley, formerly of your city, whose long residence here has made him\r\nunusually well acquainted with the operations of the lobby.\r\n\r\nHaving made my wants in this particular direction known, in answer to an\r\ninterrogative, Mr. Ashley said:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, during my residence here I have become well acquainted with the\r\nworkings of the 'Third House,' as it is termed, and could tell you of\r\nnumerous jobs, which, like the 'Heathen Chinee,' are peculiar.\"\r\n\r\n\"You do not regard the lobby, as a body, vicious, do you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not necessarily so, there are good and bad men comprising that body; yet\r\nthere have been times when it must be admitted that the combined power of\r\nthe 'Third House' has overridden the will of the people. The bad influence\r\nof the lobby can be seen in the numerous blood-bills that are introduced\r\nat every session.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how can these be discovered?\"\r\n\r\n\"Easily enough, to the person who has made the thing a study. I can detect\r\nthem at a glance.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tell me, to what bills do you refer?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, take the annual gas bills, for instance. They are introduced for\r\nthe purpose of bleeding the Washington Gas Light company. They usually\r\nresult in an investigating committee which never amounts to anything more\r\nthan a draft upon the public treasury for the expenses of the\r\ninvestigation. Another squeeze is the _abattoir_ bills, as they are\r\ncalled. These, of course, are fought by the butchers and market-men. The\r\nfirst attempt to force a bill of this description was in 1877, when a\r\nprominent Washington politician offered a fabulous sum for the franchise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anything else in this line that you think of, Mr. Ashley?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, there's the job to reclaim the Potomac flats, which, had it become a\r\nlaw, would have resulted in an enormous steal. The work is now being done\r\nby the Government itself, and will rid the place of that malarial\r\natmosphere of which we hear so much outside the city.\"\r\n\r\n\"During your residence here have you experienced the bad results of living\r\nin this climate?\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, while I have not at all times enjoyed good health, I am certain\r\nthat the difficulty which laid me up so long was not malarial. It was\r\nsomething that had troubled me for years. A shooting, stinging pain that\r\nat times attacked different parts of my body. One day my right arm and leg\r\nwould torture me with pain, there would be great redness, heat and\r\nswelling of the parts; and perhaps the next day the left arm and leg would\r\nbe similarly affected. Then again it would locate in some particular part\r\nof my body and produce a tenderness which would well nigh drive me\r\nfrantic. There would be weeks at a time that I would be afflicted with an\r\nintermitting kind of pain that would come on every afternoon and leave me\r\ncomparatively free from suffering during the balance of the twenty-four\r\nhours. Then I would have terrible paroxysms of pain coming on at any time\r\nduring the day or night when I would be obliged to lie upon my back for\r\nhours and keep as motionless as possible. Every time I attempted to move a\r\nchilly sensation would pass over my body, or I would faint from hot\r\nflashes. I suffered from a spasmodic contraction of the muscles and a\r\nsoreness of the back and bowels, and even my eyeballs become sore and\r\ndistressed me greatly whenever I wiped my face. I became ill-tempered,\r\npeevish, fretful, irritable and desperately despondent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you consulted the doctors regarding your difficulty?\"\r\n\r\n\"Consulted them? well I should say I did. Some told me I had neuralgia;\r\nothers that I had inflammatory rheumatism, for which there was no cure,\r\nthat I would be afflicted all my life, and that time alone would mitigate\r\nmy sufferings.\"\r\n\r\n\"But didn't they try to relieve your miseries?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they vomited and physicked me, blistered and bled me, plastered and\r\noiled me, sweat, steamed, and everything but froze me, but without avail.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how did you finally recover?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had a friend living in Michigan who had been afflicted in a similar way\r\nand had been cured. He wrote me regarding his recovery and advised me to\r\ntry the remedy which cured him. I procured a bottle and commenced its use,\r\ntaking a teaspoonful after each meal and at bed-time. I had used it about\r\na week when I noticed a decrease of the soreness of the joints and a\r\ngeneral feeling of relief. I persevered in its use and finally got so I\r\ncould move around without limping, when I told my friends that it was\r\nWarner's Safe Rheumatic Cure that had put me on my feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you regard your cure as permanent?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, I haven't been so well in years as I am now, and although I\r\nhave been subjected to frequent and severe changes of weather this winter,\r\nI have not felt the first intimation of the return of my rheumatic\r\ntrouble.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you object to the publication of this interview, Mr. Ashley?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, sir. I look upon it as a duty I owe my fellow creatures to\r\nalleviate their sufferings so far as I am able, and any communication\r\nregarding my symptoms and cure that may be sent to me at 506 Maine avenue\r\nwill receive prompt and careful attention.\"\r\n\r\n\"Judging from your recital, Mr. Ashley, there must be wonderful curative\r\nproperties about this medicine?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, there is, sir, for no man suffered more nor longer than did I\r\nbefore this remedy gave me relief.\"\r\n\r\n\"To go back to the original subject, Mr. Ashley, I suppose you see the\r\nsame familiar faces about the lobby session after session?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not so much so as you might think. New faces are constantly seen and\r\nold ones disappear. The strain upon lobbyists is necessarily very great,\r\nand when you add to this the demoralizing effect of late hours and\r\nintemperate habits and the fact that they are after found out in their\r\nsteals, their disappearance can easily be accounted for.\"\r\n\r\n\"What proportion of these blood-bills are successful?\"\r\n\r\n\"A very small percentage, sir. Notwithstanding the power and influence of\r\nthe lobby, but few of these vicious measures pass. Were they successful it\r\nwould be a sad commentary upon our system of government, and would\r\nvirtually annihilate one branch of it. The great majority of them are\r\neither reported adversely or smothered in committee by the watchfulness\r\nand loyalty of our congressmen.\"     J. E.

It may now be reasonably predicted that\r\nthis remark will not remain true after November next. We have heard\r\nnothing said about it, but it is to be presumed there will be no extra\r\ncharge to visit this exhibit.

It was then supposed to be about\r\ntwenty years old. For more than forty years this man cared for his pet\r\nwith unflagging faithfulness. Dying at the age of sixty-five he left it to\r\nthe care of a little daughter of a lady who had shown him kindness. This\r\ngirl grew to womanhood and to middle age caring tenderly for the plant.\r\nAbout two years ago the plant exhibiting signs of blooming, a gentleman\r\njoined with the lady and erected a building for it near the Exposition\r\nbuilding, in this city. Here it has since been, but through carelessness\r\nit was unduly exposed to the terrible freeze of the first week in January\r\nlast, and the plant is now past recovery. The lady had expended upon it\r\nabout all the means she possessed expecting to reap from admission fees to\r\nsee it a rich reward. Thus eighty years of care and constant expense came\r\nto naught in a single night. A neglect to order coal resulted in the fire\r\ngoing out just when the cold was the most intense. One can hardly imagine\r\nthe disappointment and regret of the lady who had nursed it with such care\r\nfor nearly a lifetime.\r\n\r\n\r\nLUMBER AND SHINGLES.\r\n\r\nThe white pine lumber product of the Northwest last year was according to\r\nlatest returns, 7,624,789,786 feet against 3,993,780,000 in 1873, and more\r\nthan double what it was in 1874. In 1882 the production was nearly\r\n100,000,000 feet less than last year. The smallest product of the decade\r\nwas in 1877--3,595,333,496 feet. What is termed the Chicago District,\r\nincluding the points of Green Bay, Cheboygan, Manistee, Ludington, White\r\nLake, Muskegon, Grand Haven, and Spring Lake, and a few scattering mills\r\ngave a product in 1883 of 2,111,070,076 feet. At Ludington and Grand Haven\r\nthere has been a decline in the product since 1873; at all the other\r\npoints the increase has been considerable, amounting to a total of nearly\r\n800,000,000 feet. The largest cut is on the Mississippi river in what is\r\nknown as the West of Chicago District. Here in 1873 the product amounted\r\nto 650,000,000 feet; last year it reached 1,290,062,690 feet. The Saginaw\r\nValley gives the next greatest yield 961,781,164 feet. The total Saginaw\r\ndistrict gave last year 1,439,852,067 feet against 792,358,000 ten years\r\nago. The total of the West of Chicago District was 3,134,331,793 against\r\n1,353,000,000 in 1873. The Railroad and Interior Mills District has\r\nincreased something over 200,000,000 feet in this period.\r\n\r\nIn shingles we have the grand product in all the Northwest of\r\n3,964,736,639 against 2,277,433,550 in 1873. The greatest increase was in\r\nthe Chicago District as given above, and here Ludington and Grand Haven\r\ncome in for an increase at the former place of over 33,000,000, and the\r\nlatter of more than 100,000,000. The total production of shingles in 1882\r\nwas larger than last year by about 130,000,000, but with that exception\r\nwas the largest ever known.\r\n\r\nThe census of 1880 placed the annual lumber product of the United States\r\nat 18,000,000,000 feet. The Northwest then produced 5,651,295,000 feet or\r\nnearly one-third the entire product of the country. If this ratio has been\r\nuniform since we must now have a yield of over 20,000,000,000 feet. These\r\nare figures of enormous magnitude and of varied import. They mean\r\nemployment to an army of men, a large shipping interest, vast investments\r\nin mills and machinery, and vast incomes to owners of pine lands; they\r\nmean houses and barns and fences to a new and populous empire; they mean\r\nnumberless farms and millions of live stock. They also signify a rapid\r\ndestruction of our immense forests from the face of the earth, enormous\r\nprices for lumber to future generations, and possible floods to devastate\r\nour river bottoms, and drouths to scourge the highlands. They should\r\nimpress us all with the necessity and the profitableness of timber\r\nplanting on the unsettled and newly settled prairies and in thousands of\r\nplaces in all the older States.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOT-AND-MOUTH DISEASE.\r\n\r\nAlarming reports from different parts of the country announcing the\r\npresence of foot-and-mouth disease have caused no inconsiderable\r\nexcitement among the people and in Government circles. First there came\r\nnews of an outbreak in Effingham county, Illinois, then in Louisa county,\r\nIowa, quickly followed by similar information from Adair county, Missouri.\r\n\r\nDr. Paaren, dispatched to Effingham county by the Governor, reports the\r\ntrouble there not foot-and-mouth disease. There does exist a disease\r\nthere, however, similar to foot-rot in sheep, that is proving fatal to\r\nmany cattle. There have also been outbreaks of disease among cattle near\r\nDuquoin and Xenia, Illinois, which Dr. Paaren has been directed to\r\ninvestigate.\r\n\r\nNo official reports as to the disease in Iowa and Missouri have been\r\nreceived, though Government Veterinary inspectors are now upon the ground\r\nmaking their investigations. It is said that several hundred head of\r\ncattle are affected in Missouri, though this is probably an exaggeration.\r\n\r\nThere is no news regarding the disease in Maine.\r\n\r\nReports from Kansas say the infected herds are strictly quarantined, and\r\nthat as yet no fresh outbreaks have occurred. It is proposed to annihilate\r\nthe five infected herds.\r\n\r\nGov. Glick has convened the Legislature of Kansas in order that proper\r\nmeasures may be taken to protect the cattle interests of the State.\r\n\r\nA Des Moines dispatch dated the 15th, says letters from Louisa county to\r\nthe Governor in regard to the new cattle disease were read in the House,\r\nand on motion of Mr. Watrous that body adopted the substitute for the bill\r\nproviding for the appointment of a State veterinary surgeon. The\r\nsubstitute authorizes the veterinary surgeon to destroy all stock affected\r\nwith contagious disease. The bill is intended to enable the State to take\r\naction in the foot-and-mouth disease now affecting the stock. Discussion\r\nthen followed upon the substitute, which was taken up section by section,\r\nand it was for the most part adopted.\r\n\r\nThe series of reported outbreaks mentioned has aroused Congress to the\r\nnecessity of action. The Senate on Monday passed a joint resolution\r\nappropriating $50,000 for the suppression of the disease in whatever State\r\nor Territory it appears.\r\n\r\nIt is to be hoped that the Animal Industry bill will at once pass and\r\nbecome a law. The cattle dealers at the Chicago Union Stock Yards have\r\norganized a Live Stock Exchange, and the first action taken by it is to\r\nfight this bill in Congress. Emory A. Storrs, attorney for the heavy\r\nbrokers, is in Washington working might and main for its defeat. He finds\r\nit uphill work, evidently, for on Monday he sent a dispatch to Nelson\r\nMorris in these words: \"Send to-day a delegation of strong men; everything\r\nnow depends on backing; wire me at once protest; have seen several\r\nsenators this morning; advise me when delegation starts; have them stop at\r\nRiggs house.\"\r\n\r\nActing under this advice the Exchange passed the following resolutions of\r\n\"unbelief.\"\r\n\r\n     Whereas, It is the universal sentiment of the Chicago Live\r\n     Stock Exchange, at the Union Stock Yards in Chicago, that\r\n     the bill now pending before Congress, known as the \"Animal\r\n     Industry bill,\" is dangerous in its design, not called for\r\n     by the condition of the live stock interest in this\r\n     country, and tends to place too much power in the\r\n     Department of Agriculture at Washington; therefore,\r\n\r\n     Resolved, That Elmer Washburn, Allan Gregory, F. D.\r\n     Bartlett, B. F. Harrison, and H. H. Conover, members of\r\n     this exchange, be, and hereby are, appointed a committee,\r\n     with instructions to proceed forthwith to Washington, and\r\n     present these resolutions to the proper authorities to\r\n     prevent the passage of said \"Animal Industry bill.\"\r\n\r\n     Resolved, Further, that owing to the present excitement\r\n     throughout the United States over the false alarm of\r\n     pleuro-pneumonia and \"foot-and-mouth\" disease, that we, as\r\n     a body, should express our views fully upon this question.\r\n\r\n     1. We do not believe there is such a disease as contagious\r\n     pleuro-pneumonia existing throughout the United States.\r\n\r\n     2. We do not believe that such a disease as the\r\n     foot-and-mouth disease exists in either Illinois, Iowa, or\r\n     Kansas.\r\n\r\n     3. That at no time within the space of twenty years have\r\n     the cattle, sheep, or hogs of this country been in as\r\n     healthy a condition as at the present time; for while we\r\n     are in favor of strict quarantine laws to prevent any\r\n     importation of disease into this country from abroad, we\r\n     believe if any disease should break out in this State, or\r\n     any other State, that the citizens would be interested\r\n     sufficiently to stamp it out without expense to the\r\n     National Government.\r\n\r\nWhile these resolutions were being discussed Dr. Detmers appeared in the\r\nhall (accidentally of course!) and gave it as his opinion that not a\r\nsingle case of foot-and-mouth disease existed in America to-day. But the\r\nDoctor has so often put his foot in it in his mouthings about animal\r\ndiseases in the past that his beliefs or disbeliefs have little weight\r\nwith the public. The Doctor is evidently \"put out\" because he was not\r\ncalled upon to visit the infected districts, for he is reported as ending\r\nhis harangue by declaring he was tired of working for the Government, and\r\noffered his services to the Live Stock Exchange.\r\n\r\nSuch, in brief, is a summary of the news of the week concerning the\r\nfoot-and-mouth disease outbreaks in the States.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREMIUMS ON CORN.\r\n\r\nAs briefly stated in a previous issue of THE PRAIRIE FARMER, the Illinois\r\nState Board of Agriculture offers a premium of $100 for the best bushel of\r\ncorn (in ear) grown this year in the northern division of the State, and\r\n$50 for the second best bushel: and a like premium for the best and second\r\nbest bushel grown in the central and southern divisions. These divisions\r\ncorrespond with the three judicial divisions of the State. The following\r\nare the conditions:\r\n\r\nEach of the parties awarded the first premium to deliver twenty-five\r\nbushels, and each of the parties awarded the second premium to deliver\r\nfifteen bushels of corn in the ear in sacks to the State Board of\r\nAgriculture at Springfield, Ill. The corn delivered to be equal in quality\r\nto the samples awarded the respective premiums. The premiums to be paid\r\nwhen the premium bushels of corn and the amounts called for are compared\r\nat the rooms of the Department of Agriculture and favorably reported upon\r\nby the committee.\r\n\r\nAffidavit as to measurement of land and yield of corn are required.\r\n\r\nWe suppose also that competitors are to furnish characteristics of soil,\r\nvariety of seed, kinds of manure used, mode of cultivation etc., as these\r\nfacts would seem to be necessary if the public is to receive the full\r\nbenefits of the experiments the premiums are likely to bring out.\r\n\r\nIt is understood that the corn delivered to the State Board as per above\r\nconditions is to be in some judicious manner distributed to the\r\ncorn-growers of the State for planting in 1885.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST UNFORTUNATE RESULT.\r\n\r\nThere recently began in Scotland an earnest movement to induce the British\r\nGovernment to remove the restrictions regarding the importation of\r\nAmerican cattle, so far at least as to allow the admission of store cattle\r\nfor feeding purposes. Meetings have been held in various parts of Scotland\r\nat which petitions like the following were adopted.\r\n\r\n     To the Right Honorable William Ewart Gladstone.\r\n\r\n     We, the undersigned, farmers and others, respectfully\r\n     submit that the present law which allows the importation of\r\n     cattle from the United States, and shuts out store cattle,\r\n     is unjust and oppressive to the farmers of this country,\r\n     and enhances the price of meat to the public. We therefore\r\n     crave that her Majesty's Government would open the Scottish\r\n     ports to the introduction of store cattle from the Western\r\n     States where disease does not exist.\r\n\r\nAt a meeting at Montrose, where the above petition was favorably acted\r\nupon, Mr. Falconer, an Angus farmer, in supporting the motion, said that\r\nthe first great remedy for the present depression was to get cheap store\r\ncattle, and that would never be got until they opened their ports to the\r\nWestern States of America. He held that if farmers would agree to insist\r\non live store cattle being allowed to be landed in Britain, they would\r\nsoon get them. When they get them, he, if then alive, would be quite\r\nwilling to take all the responsibility if they found an unsound or\r\nunhealthy animal amongst them. He appealed to butchers in Montrose, who\r\nhad been in the way of killing States or Canadian cattle, if they were not\r\ntotally free of disease; and he would like to ask them how many Irish\r\ncattle they killed which were perfectly healthy. If they got stores from\r\nAmerica, they would not effect a saving in price, but, as they all knew,\r\nsound healthy cattle fed much quicker than unsound, and were of better\r\nquality, and thus an additional item of profit would be secured to the\r\nfarmer.\r\n\r\nMr. A. Milne, cattle-dealer, Montrose, corroborated Mr. Falconer's\r\nstatements as to the healthiness of American stock, while Irish cattle, as\r\na rule, he said, had very bad livers.\r\n\r\nMr. Adamson, Morphie, said he had recently been in the Western States of\r\nAmerica, and had seen a number of the ranches in Nebraska, Wyoming, and\r\nColorado. The cattle there were certainly fine animals--well bred, as a\r\nrule, either from Herefords or Short-horns, with a dash of the Texan\r\ncattle in them. When there, he made careful inquiries as to the existence\r\nof disease, and he was universally told that such a thing as epidemic\r\ndisease was unknown. No doubt in the southern part of Texas there was a\r\nlittle Texan fever, but that, like yellow fever, was merely indigenous to\r\nthe district. It was never seen out of these parts. He considered it would\r\nbe a great boon to the farmers of Scotland if they could get cattle L3 or\r\nL4 cheaper than at present. It would save a very considerable amount of\r\nmoney in stocking a farm, and would also tell on the profits of the\r\nfeeders, and the prices paid by the consumers. They had them to spare in\r\nAmerica in the greatest possible abundance.\r\n\r\nAt a late meeting of the Prairie Cattle Company, having headquarters in\r\nScotland, sheriff Guthrie Smith expressed the opinion that the great\r\nprofit in the future of American ranch companies must be the trade in\r\nyoung cattle. He believed that Scottish farmers would ere long get all\r\ntheir young cattle, not from Ireland, but from the United States. It did\r\nnot pay them to breed calves; they were better selling milk. The fattening\r\nof cattle for the butcher was the paying part of the business, but the\r\ndifficulty was to get yearlings or two-year-olds at their proper price.\r\n\r\nHere promised to arise a new outlet for American stock, and one which most\r\nof us probably never thought of. The proposition had in it the elements\r\nfor the building up of a great commercial industry and of affording a new\r\nand rapid impetus to the breeding of cattle upon the plains. But just at\r\nthis time comes the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in Kansas, Maine,\r\nand Illinois, and of course puts an end to all hopes in this direction,\r\nfor many months at least. This is the result of the disease at its first\r\nappearance. Here is prospective loss before the Government veterinary\r\nsurgeons fairly reach the field of operations against its spread--the loss\r\nof a trade which would have been worth many millions to the cattle raisers\r\nof the great West. It is to be feared that this is but the beginning of\r\nthe losses the disease will entail upon us. Can Congress longer hesitate\r\nin this matter of providing an efficient law for protection from\r\ncontagious animal diseases? It would seem not. Our State authorities,\r\nalso, must be alert, and render all possible aid in preventing the spread\r\nof this wonderfully infectious disease.\r\n\r\n       *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\nWe have a large number of letters and postal cards asking where various\r\nseeds, plants, shrubs, trees, silk-worm eggs, bone dust and so on and so\r\nforth to an indefinite extent, may be obtained. We have answered some of\r\nthese inquiries by letter, some through the paper, but they still keep\r\ncoming. We have one favor to ask of those seeking this sort of\r\ninformation: First look through the advertisements carefully, and see if\r\nwhat is wanted is not advertised. The seedsmen's advertisements do not, of\r\ncourse, enumerate all the parties have for sale, but it may be taken for\r\ngranted that they keep nearly all kinds of grass, grain, and vegetable\r\nseeds. We would also say to seedsmen that it will probably be found to pay\r\nthem to advertise the seeds of the new grasses, alfalfa, the special\r\nfertilizers, etc., that are now being so much inquired about. We have a\r\nlarge number of inquiries about where to obtain silk-worm eggs. Persons\r\nwho have them certainly make a mistake in not advertising them freely.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuestions Answered.\r\n\r\nO. G. B., SHEBOYGAN FALLS, WIS.--Will you give directions which will be\r\npractical for tanning skins or pelts with the fur or hair on by the use of\r\noak bark?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--We know of no way the thing can be done unless a part of the\r\nmethods are used that are employed in the tanning of goat skins for making\r\nMorocco leather. These are: to soak the skins to soften them; then put\r\nthem into a lime vat to remove the hair, and after to take the lime out in\r\na douche consisting of hen and pigeon dung. This done, the skins are then\r\nsewed up so as to hold the tanning liquid, which consists of a warm and\r\nstrong decoction of Spanish sumac. The skins are filled with this liquid,\r\nthen piled up one above the other and subsequently refilled, two or three\r\ntimes, or as fast as the liquid is forced through the skins. If the furs\r\nor pelts were first soaked to soften them, all the fatty, fleshy matter\r\ncarefully removed, after sewed up as goat skins are, and then filled and\r\nrefilled several times with a strong decoction of white oak bark, warm,\r\nbut not hot, no doubt the result would prove satisfactory.\r\n\r\nDR. J. F. SCHLIEMAN, HARTFORD, WIS.--Are there any works on the\r\ncultivation of the blueberry, and if so could you furnish the same? Do you\r\nknow of any parties that cultivate them?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--We have never come across anything satisfactory on the\r\ncultivation of the blueberry except in Le Bon Jardiniere, which says: \"The\r\nsuccessful cultivation of the whole tribe of Vacciniums is very difficult.\r\nThe shrubs do not live long and are reproduced with much difficulty,\r\neither by layers or seeds.\" The blueberry, like the cranberry, appears to\r\nbe a potash plant, the swamp variety not growing well except where the\r\nwater is soft, the soil peaty above and sandy below. The same appears also\r\nto be true of the high land blueberry; the soil where they grow is\r\ngenerally sandy and the water soft. You can procure Le Bon Jardiniere (a\r\nwork which is a treasure to the amateur in fruit and plants) of Jansen,\r\nMcClurg & Co., of Chicago, at 30 cents, the franc. Some parties, we think,\r\noffer blueberry plants for sale, but we do not recollect who they are.\r\n\r\nH. HARRIS, HOLT'S PRAIRIE, ILL.--Will it do to tile drain land\r\nwhich has a hard pan of red clay twelve to eighteen inches below the\r\nsurface?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--It will do no harm to the land to drain it if there is a hard pan\r\nnear the surface, but in order to make tile draining effective on such\r\nland, the drains will have to be at half the distance common on soils\r\nwithout the hard pan.\r\n\r\nSUBSCRIBER, DECATUR, ILL.--In testing seed corn, what per cent must sprout\r\nto be called first-class. I have some twenty bushels of Stowell's\r\nEvergreen that was carefully gathered, assorted, and shelled by hand.\r\nThis I have tested by planting twenty-one grains, of which sixteen grew.\r\nHow would you class it?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--Ninety-five, certainly. If five kernels out of twenty-one failed\r\nto grow, that would be 31 per cent of bad seed, and we should consider the\r\nquality inferior. But further, if under the favorable condition of trial,\r\n31 percent failed, ten grains in every twenty-one would be almost sure to,\r\nin the field. It was a mistake to shell the corn; seed should always\r\nremain on the cob to the last moment, because if it is machine or\r\nhand-shelled at low temperature, and put away in bulk, when warm weather\r\ncomes, it is sure to sweat, and if it heats, the germ is destroyed. Better\r\nspread your corn out in the dry, and where it will not freeze, as soon as\r\nyou can.\r\n\r\nL. C. LEANIARTT (?) NEBRASKA.--I wish to secure a blue grass pasture in my\r\ntimber for hogs. 1. Will it be necessary to keep them out till the grass\r\ngets a good start? 2. Shall I follow the directions you gave Mr. Perkins\r\nin THE PRAIRIE FARMER, February 9? 3. Is not blue grass pasture the best\r\nthing I can give my hogs?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--1. Better do so, and you will then be more likely to get a good\r\ncatch and full stand. 2. Certainly, if the conditions are the same. 3.\r\nBlue grass is very good for hogs, but it is improved by the addition of\r\nclover.\r\n\r\nC. C. SAMUELS, SPRINGFIELD, ILL.--1. What pears would you recommend for\r\nthis latitude? 2. Are there any which do not blight? 3. I have some grape\r\nvines, light colored fruit, but late, Elvira, I think the nurseryman told\r\nme, which appear to be suffering from something at the roots. What is the\r\nphylloxera, and what shall I do to my grape vines if they infest the\r\nroots?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--The Bartlett for _certain_--it being the best of all the\r\npears--and the Kieffer and Le Conte for _experiment_. If the latter\r\nsucceed you will have lots of nice large fruit just about as desirable for\r\neating as a Ben Davis apple in May. 2. We know of one only, the Tyson, a\r\nsmallish summer pear that never blights, at least in some localities,\r\nwhere all others do more or less. 3. If your Elviras are afflicted with\r\nthe phylloxera, a root-bark louse, manure and fertilize them at once, and\r\nirrigate or water them in the warm season. The French vine-growers seem at\r\nlast to have found out that lice afflict half starved grape roots, as they\r\ndo half starved cattle, and that they have only to feed and water\r\ncarefully to restore their vines to health.\r\n\r\nJ. S. S., SPRINGFIELD, ILL.--I am not a stock man nor a farmer; but I have\r\nsome pecuniary interests, in common with others, my friends, in a Kansas\r\ncattle ranch. I am therefore a good deal exercised about this\r\nfoot-and-mouth disease. Is it the terrible scourge reported by one cattle\r\ndoctor, who, according to the papers, says, \"the only remedies are fire or\r\ndeath.\" What do you say?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--The disease is a bad one, very contagious, but easily yields to\r\nremedies in the first stages.\r\n\r\nTHOMAS V. JOHNSON, LEXINGTON, KY.--There is a report here that your draft\r\nhorses of all breeds are not crossing with satisfaction on your common\r\nsteeds in Illinois, and that not more twenty five in one hundred of the\r\nmares for the last three years have thrown foal, nor will they the present\r\nseason. Can you give me the facts?\r\n\r\nANSWER.--Our correspondent has certainly been misinformed, or is an\r\nunconscious victim of local jealousy, as he may easily convince himself by\r\nvisiting interior towns, every one of which is a horse market.\r\n\r\n\r\nWayside Notes.\r\n\r\nBY A MAN OF THE PRAIRIE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA neighbor of mine who has been intending to purchase store cattle and\r\nsheep at the Chicago Stock Yards soon, asked me last night what I thought\r\nabout his doing so. I asked him if he had read what THE PRAIRIE\r\nFARMER and other papers had contained of late regarding foot-and-mouth\r\ndisease in Maine, Kansas, Illinois, and Iowa. He had not; did not take the\r\npapers, and had not heard anything about the disease here or in England.\r\nThen I explained to him, as best I could, its nature, contagious\r\ncharacter, etc., and having a PRAIRIE FARMER in my pocket, read him your\r\nbrief history of the ailment in Great Britain. Well, that man was\r\nastonished. Finally, said he, What has that got to do with my question\r\nabout buying cattle and sheep at the stock yards? Just this, I replied:\r\nevery day there are arrivals at the stock yards of many thousands of\r\ncattle from these infected States. Perhaps some of them come from the very\r\ncounties where this disease is known to exist. The disease may break out\r\nany day in scores of places in all these States. It may appear--indeed is\r\nquite likely to do so at the stock yards. For aught I know it may be there\r\nnow. The cattle brokers will not be very likely to make known such an\r\nunwelcome fact a minute sooner than they are obliged to. In fact, from\r\nwhat they have lately been saying about the absurdity of new and stringent\r\nenactments concerning animal diseases, I conclude they will labor to\r\nconceal cases that may really exist. Now you go there to pick up cattle to\r\nconsume your pasturage this spring and summer, and don't you see you run\r\nthe risk of taking to your home and neighborhood a disease that may cost\r\nyou and your neighbors many thousands of dollars? If I were you I would\r\npick up the stock I want in my own neighborhood and county, even though\r\nnot exactly the kind I would like to have, and though it would cost me a\r\ngreat deal more time and trouble. You see to a Man of the Prairie things\r\nlook a little squally in this cattle business. We have all got to be\r\ncareful about this thing. We have a terrible enemy at our stable doors and\r\npasture gates, and we must guard them well. I am not an alarmist, but I\r\nwould run any time, almost, rather than get licked, and I have always\r\ntried to keep a lock on the stable door before the horse is stolen. I am\r\nin favor of _in_-trenchment. Perhaps my advice to my neighbor was not\r\nsound, but according to the light I have, I have no desire to recall it\r\ntill I hear more from the infected districts.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo show the difference between the winter in Colorado and the States this\r\nway and further west, the Farmer, of Denver, mentions the fact that it\r\nknows a farmer who has had about two hundred acres of new land broken\r\nbetween the middle of November and the first of March. Still, these\r\nEastern States have advantages which render them rather pleasant to live\r\nin. Our farmers find plenty of time in fall and spring in which to do\r\ntheir plowing and sowing, and our severe winters don't seem to hurt the\r\nground a bit. In fact, I suppose it has got used to them, sort of\r\nacclimated, as it were. We have pretty good markets, low railway fares,\r\ngood schools and plenty of them, and we manage to enjoy ourselves just as\r\nwell as though we could hitch up to the plow and do our breaking in\r\nDecember and January. We can't all go to Colorado, Dakota, Montana, or\r\nWashington Territory, nor to those other Edens at the South and Southwest\r\nwhere a man, so far as winter is concerned, may work about every day in\r\nthe year; but don't do so any more than we here at the North where we have\r\nthe excuse of severe weather for our laziness between November and April.\r\nI like Colorado and Wyoming, Arkansas and Texas, Alabama and Florida--for\r\nother people who like to make their homes there, but my home is here and I\r\nlike it. \"I don't _have_ to\" plow in winter, and I don't need to. I am\r\ngoing to try to do my duty and be happy where I am, believing Heaven to be\r\njust as near Illinois as any other State or any Territory.\r\n\r\n\r\nI read in the dispatches this morning that the barns on a ranch near Omaha\r\nburned the other night. With the barns were consumed twenty-six cows,\r\neighteen horses, 1,000 bushels of corn and a large lot of hay and oats. In\r\nall the loss amounted to above $10,000 and there was no insurance. From\r\nall over the country and at all times of the year I read almost daily of\r\nsimilar losses varying from $100 up into the thousands, and the closing\r\nsentence of about nine out of ten of these announcements is \"no\r\ninsurance.\" Now I am neither an insurance agent nor a lightning rod\r\npeddler, but there are two luxuries that I indulge in all the time, and\r\nthese are an insurance policy to fairly cover my farm buildings and their\r\ncontents, and what I believe to be well constructed lightning rods in\r\nsufficient number to protect the property from electric eccentricities.\r\nTrue, my buildings have never suffered from fire or lightning and these\r\nluxuries have cost me no inconsiderable amount of cash, but this money has\r\nbrought me relief from a heap of anxiety, for I know in case my property\r\nis swept away I am not left stripped and powerless to provide for my\r\nfamily, and I know that it will not be necessary to mortgage the farm to\r\nfurnish them a shelter. I don't take _cheap_ insurance either, but invest\r\nmy money in the policy of a company which I believe has abundant capital\r\nand is cautiously managed. A wealthy man can take his fire risks in his\r\nown hands if he chooses, but for a man of small or moderate means it seems\r\nto me the height of folly to do so. I would rather go without tobacco or\r\n\"biled shirts\" than insurance and lightning rods.\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't know that an American farmer ever had the gout. Certainly I never\r\nheard of such a case. If one does get the ailment, however, if he keeps\r\nbees he always has a sure remedy at hand. A German has discovered that if\r\na bee is allowed to sting the affected part, a cure is instantaneous. Why\r\ndon't Bismarck try this home remedy for his complication of gout and\r\ntrichinae?\r\n\r\n\r\nREMEMBER _that $2.00 pays for_ THE PRAIRIE FARMER _one year, and the\r\nsubscriber gets a copy of_ THE PRAIRIE FARMER COUNTY MAP OF THE UNITED\r\nSTATES, FREE! _This is the most liberal offer ever made by any first-class\r\nweekly agricultural paper in this country._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Poultry Notes.]\r\n\r\nPoultry-Raisers. Write for Your Paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nChicken Chat.\r\n\r\nOne of my correspondents writes: \"My hens don't eat well--they just pick\r\nover the food as if it were not good enough for them--and they don't lay\r\nwell; in fact they don't do much of anything except to mope about--not as\r\nif sick, but as if lazy.\"\r\n\r\nProbably you have fed the same thing every day for the last six months,\r\nand the hens are getting tired of it. Hens are like other people--they\r\nlike a change of provender once in awhile--especially when confined\r\nindoors. Sometimes over-feeding will cause indigestion, and then the\r\nbiddies will exhibit the symptoms you describe. In either case, let the\r\nfowls fast for a whole day, and then for a few days feed lightly with food\r\nthat is different from what they have been living on. Give plenty of green\r\nfood, also Douglas' mixture in the drinking water twice a week.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother correspondent wants to know why I always advise giving cooked food\r\nto fowls and chicks when uncooked food is the natural diet.\r\n\r\nI advise cooked food because experience has taught me that it is much\r\nbetter for poultry than the raw articles would be. Because raw bugs and\r\nworms constitute the \"natural diet\" of fowls in their wild state, it does\r\nnot follow that raw meal and potatoes would be the best and most\r\neconomical food for our domestic fowls. Other things being equal, chicks\r\nthat are fed on cooked food grow fatter, are less liable to disease, and\r\nthrive better generally than those who worry along on uncooked rations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you are short of sitting hens and don't own an incubator, make the hens\r\ndo double duty. Set two or more at the same time, and when the chicks come\r\nout, give two families to one hen, and set the other over again. To do\r\nthis successfully, the chicks must be taken from the nest as soon as dry\r\nand given to the hen that is to raise them; for if a hen once leaves the\r\nnest with her chicks, no amount of moral suasion will induce her to go\r\nback. Before giving the hen fresh eggs, the nest should be renovated and\r\nthe hen dusted with sulphur or something to prevent lice.\r\n\r\n\r\nA lady who commenced raising thoroughbred poultry last season writes me\r\nthat she proposes to sell eggs for hatching this season, and asks for\r\ninformation about advertising, packing eggs, etc.\r\n\r\nThe advertising is easy enough: all you have to do is to write a copy of\r\nyour \"ad.,\" send it to THE PRAIRIE FARMER and other papers that circulate\r\namong farmers, pay the bills, and answer the postals and letters as they\r\ncome. But if I were in your shoes, I would \"put my foot down\" on the\r\npostals to begin with; they don't amount to anything anyway; the people\r\nwho ask a long string of questions on a postal card are not, as a rule,\r\nthe ones who become customers. Before we went into the poultry business an\r\nold poultry-breeder said: \"Don't have anything to do with postals, it\r\ndon't pay.\" We thought differently, but to satisfy ourselves, we kept\r\ntrack of the postals, and to-day I have the addresses of over 300 people\r\nwho wrote us on postal cards. How many of those people became customers?\r\nJust one, and he was an Ohio man. When I go into that branch of the\r\npoultry business again, my advertisements will contain a postscript which\r\nwill read thusly: \"No postals answered.\"\r\n\r\nAnd you need not expect that every letter will mean business; people who\r\nhave not the remotest idea of buying eggs will write and ask your prices,\r\netc., and you must answer them all alike. Here is where circulars save\r\nlots of work and postage. I have sent you by mail what I call a model\r\ncircular, and from that you can get up something to fit your case. Pack\r\nyour eggs in baskets in cut straw or chaff, first wrapping each egg\r\nseparately in paper. The eggs should not touch each other or the basket.\r\nPut plenty of packing on top, and with a darning needle and stout twine\r\nsew on a cover of stout cotton cloth. For the address use shipping tags,\r\nor else mark it plainly on the white cotton cover; I prefer the latter\r\nway. A day or two before you ship the eggs send a postal telling your\r\ncustomer when to look for them; that's all that postals are good for.\r\n\r\nConcerning the duplicating of orders in cases of failure of the eggs to\r\nhatch, I quote from one of my old circulars: \"I guarantee to furnish fresh\r\neggs, true to name, from pure-bred, standard fowls, packed to carry safely\r\nany distance. In cases of total failure, when the eggs have been properly\r\ncared for and set within two weeks after arrival, orders will be\r\nduplicated free of charge.\" I furnished just what I promised, and when a\r\ntotal failure was reported I sent the second sitting free--though\r\nsometimes I felt sure that the eggs were not properly cared for, and once\r\na man reported a failure when, as I afterwards learned, eight eggs of the\r\nfirst sitting hatched. But, generally speaking, my customers were pretty\r\nwell satisfied. It sometimes happens that only one or two eggs out of a\r\nsitting will hatch, and naturally the customer feels that he has not\r\nreceived the worth of his money. In such cases, if both parties are\r\nwilling to do just what is right, the matter can be arranged so that all\r\nwill be satisfied. And you will sometimes get hold of a customer that\r\nnothing under the heavens will satisfy; when this happens, do just exactly\r\nas you would wish to be done by, and there let the matter end.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf the lady who wrote from Carroll county, Illinois, concerning an\r\nincubator, will write again and give the name of her postoffice, she will\r\nreceive a reply by mail.\r\n\r\nFANNY FIELD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE APIARY.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSpring Care of Bees.\r\n\r\nAlthough yesterday was very cold and inclement, to-day (March 11th) is\r\nwarm and pleasant, and bees that are wintered upon their summer stands\r\nwill be upon the wing. It would be well on such days as this to see that\r\nall entrances to hives are open, so that no hindrances may be in the way\r\nof house-cleaning. This is all we think necessary for this month, provided\r\nthey have plenty of stores to last until flowers bloom. Handling bees\r\ntends to excite them to brood rearing, and veterans in bee-culture claim\r\nthat this uses up the vitality of bees in spring very fast. Although more\r\nyoung may be reared, it is at the risk of the old ones, as they leave the\r\nhive in search of water; many thus perish, which often results in the\r\ndeath of the colony, as the young perish for want of nurses. Sometimes,\r\nalso, in handling bees early in the season the queens are lost, as they\r\nmay fall upon the ground, yet chilled, and perish.\r\n\r\nBees consume food very fast while rearing brood; naturalists tells us that\r\ninsects during the larvae state consume more food than they do during the\r\nremainder of their existence. Where a bee-keeper has been so improvident\r\nas to neglect to provide abundance of stores for his bees he should\r\nexamine them carefully, and if found wanting, remove an empty frame,\r\nsubstituting a full one in its place. Where frames of honey are not to be\r\nhad, liquid honey and sugar can be kneaded together, forming cakes, which\r\ncan be placed over the cluster. Care should be taken that no apertures are\r\nleft, thus forming a way for cold drafts through the hive. These cakes are\r\nthought to excite bees less than when liquid food is given; they have\r\nanother advantage, also, viz., bees can cluster upon them while feeding,\r\nand do not get chilled.\r\n\r\nBees that have been wintered in cellars, or special repositories, are\r\noften injured by being removed too early to their summer stands. It would\r\nbe better to let them remain, and lower the temperature during warm days\r\nwith ice, until warm weather has come to stay. An aged veteran in Vermont\r\nthat we visited the season following the disastrous winter of 1880-81,\r\ntold us that his neighbors removed their bees from the cellar during a\r\nwarm spell early in spring, and they were then in splendid condition. He\r\nlet his bees remain until pollen was plentiful, and brought them out, all\r\nbeing in fine order; by this time his neighbors' colonies were all dead.\r\n\r\nGood judgment and care must be exercised in removing bees from the cellar,\r\nor disastrous results will follow. We know of an apiary of over one\r\nhundred colonies that was badly injured, indeed nearly ruined, by all\r\nbeing taken from the cellar at once on a fine, warm day. The bees all\r\npoured out of the hives for a play spell, like children from school, and\r\nhaving been confined so long together in one apartment had acquired, in\r\nsome measure, the same scent, and soon things were badly mixed. Some\r\ncolonies swarmed, others caught the fever, and piled up together in a huge\r\nmass. This merry making may have been fun for the bees, but it was the\r\nreverse of this for the owner, as many queens were destroyed, and hives\r\nthat were populous before were carried from the cellar and left without a\r\nbee to care for the unhatched brood.\r\n\r\nWhen it is time to remove bees from the cellar the stands they are to\r\noccupy should be prepared beforehand. They should be higher at the back,\r\ninclining to the front; if the height of two bricks are at the back, one\r\nwill answer for the front. This inclination to the front is an important\r\nmatter; it facilitates the carrying out of dead bees and debris from the\r\nhive, the escape of moisture, and last, and most important item, bees will\r\nbuild their comb straight in the frame instead of crosswise of the hive,\r\nand their surplus comb in boxes correspondingly. If a few hives are\r\nremoved near the close of the day and put in different parts of the\r\napiary, the danger from swarming out is avoided, for the bees will become\r\nquiet before morning, and being far apart will not mix up when they have\r\ntheir play spell. The success of bee-keeping depends upon the faithful\r\nperformance of infinite little items.\r\n\r\nThe many friends of the Rev. L. L. Langstroth will be pained to learn that\r\nhe has a severe attack of his old malady and unable to do any mental work.\r\nMay the Lord deal kindly and gently with him.\r\n\r\nDuring the last fall and winter he has been the light of many conventions,\r\nand it will be remembered as a pleasant episode in the lives of many\r\nbee-keepers that they had the privilege of viewing his beaming\r\ncountenance, hearing the words of wisdom as they escaped from his lips,\r\nand taking the hand of this truly great and good man.\r\n\r\nMRS. L. HARRISON\r\n\r\n\r\nExtracted Honey.\r\n\r\nA couple of copies of THE PRAIRIE FARMER have lately come to my desk, a\r\nreminder of my boyhood days, when, in the old home with my father, I used\r\nto contribute an article now and then to its columns. There is an old\r\nscrap-book on the shelf, at my right, now, with some of those articles in\r\nit, published nearly thirty years ago. But my object in writing now is to\r\nadd something to Mrs. Harrison's article on Extracted Honey. Last year my\r\nhoney crop was about 3,000 pounds, and half of this was extracted, or\r\nslung honey, as we bee-keepers often call it; but for next year I have\r\ndecided to raise nearly all comb honey, for the reason that I do not get\r\ncustomers so readily for extracted honey. I have never extracted until the\r\nhoney was all, or nearly all, capped over, and then admitted air into the\r\nvessels holding it, so as to be absolutely sure of getting it \"dry,\" and\r\nproof against souring. This method has given me about half the amount\r\nothers obtained by extracting as soon as the combs were filled by the\r\nbees, and ripening afterward.\r\n\r\nBut in spite of all these precautions I find so much prejudice against\r\nextracted honey, growing out of the ignorance of the public with regard to\r\nthis sweet, ignorance equaled only by the ignorance in regard to bees\r\nthemselves, that the sale of such honey has been very slow; so slow that\r\nwhile my comb honey is reduced at this date to about 150 pounds, I have\r\nseveral ten-gallon kegs of pure white honey still on hand.\r\n\r\nEspecially is there a prejudice against candied honey, though that is an\r\nabsolute test of purity, and it can be readily liquified, as Mrs. H. says,\r\nwithout injury. When I say that it is an absolute test of purity I mean\r\nthat all honey that candies evenly is pure, though some of the best honey\r\nI have ever had never candied at all. In one case I knew the honey to\r\ncandy in the combs of a new swarm early in autumn; but some seasons,\r\nparticularly very dry ones, it will hardly candy at all. This difference\r\nseems to be due to the varying proportion of natural glucose, which will\r\ncrystallize, and levulose, or mellose, which will not crystallize.\r\nManufactured glucose will not crystallize; and some of our largest honey\r\nmerchants, even the Thurbers, of New York, have mixed artificial glucose\r\nwith honey to avoid loss by the ignorant prejudice of the public.\r\n\r\nWM.

Write us.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSilk Culture.\r\n\r\nOsage for Silk-Worms.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a private letter to the editor of THE PRAIRIE FARMER Dr. L. S.\r\nPennington, of Whiteside County, Illinois, says: \"Many thanks for your\r\ninstructive articles on Silk Culture. Could the many miles of Osage orange\r\nfound in this State be utilized for this purpose, the industry would give\r\nemployment to thousands of dependent women and children, by which means\r\nthey could make themselves, at least in part, self-supporting. I hope that\r\nyou will continue to publish and instruct your many readers on this\r\nsubject.\"\r\n\r\nAnent this subject we find the following by Prof. C. V. Riley in a late\r\nissue of the American Naturalist:\r\n\r\n\"There is a strong disposition on the part of those who look for making\r\nmoney by the propagation and sale of mulberry trees, to underrate the use\r\nof Osage orange as silk-worm food. We have thoroughly demonstrated, by the\r\nmost careful tests, on several occasions, that when Maclura aurantiaca is\r\nproperly used for this purpose, the resulting silk loses nothing in\r\nquantity or quality, and we have now a strain of Sericaria mori that has\r\nbeen fed upon the plant for twelve consecutive years without\r\ndeterioration. There has been, perhaps, a slight loss of color which, if\r\nanything, must be looked upon as an advantage. It is more than likely, how\r\never, that the different races will differ in their adaptability to the\r\nMaclura, and that for the first year the sudden transition to Maclura from\r\nMorus, upon which the worms have been fed for centuries, may result in\r\nsome depreciation. Mr. Virion des Lauriers, at the silk farm at Genito,\r\nhas completed some experiments on the relative value of the two plants,\r\nwhich he details in the opening number of the Silk-Grower's Guide and\r\nManufacturer's Gazette. Four varieties of worms were reared. The race\r\nknown as the \"Var\" was fed throughout on mulberry leaves. The \"Pyrenean\"\r\nand \"Cevennes\" worms were fed throughout on leaves and branches of Osage\r\norange, while the \"Milanese\" worms were fed on Maclura up to the second\r\nmolt and then changed to mulberry leaves. At the close examples of each\r\nvariety of cocoons were sent to the Secretary of the Silk Board at Lyons,\r\nand appraised by him The Maclura-fed cocoons were rated at 85 cents per\r\npound, those raised partly on Osage and partly on mulberry at 95 cents per\r\npound, and those fed entirely on mulberry at $1.11 per pound.\r\n\r\n\"This, Mr. des Lauriers thinks, seems to show that the difference between\r\nMaclura and Morus as silk-worm food is some 'twenty-five to thirty per\r\ncent in favor of the latter, while it is evident that the leaf of the\r\nOsage orange can be used with some advantage during the first two ages of\r\nthe worms, thus allowing the mulberry tree to grow more leafy for feeding\r\nduring the last three ages.' The experiment, although interesting, is not\r\nconclusive, from the simple fact that different races were used in the\r\ndifferent tests and not the same races, so that the result may have been\r\ndue, to a certain extent, to race and not to food.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSCIENTIFIC AND USEFUL.\r\n\r\nA writer in an English medical journal declares that the raising of the\r\nhead of the bed, by placing under each leg a block of the thickness of two\r\nbricks, is an effective remedy for cramps. Patients who have suffered at\r\nnight, crying aloud with pain, have found this plan to afford immediate,\r\ncertain, and permanent relief.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalifornia stands fifth in the list of States in the manufacture of salt,\r\nand is the only State in the Union where the distillation of salt from sea\r\nwater is carried on to any considerable extent. This industry has\r\nincreased rapidly during the last twenty years. The production has risen\r\nfrom 44,000 bushels in 1860 to upwards of 880,000 bushels in 1883.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amount of attention given to purely technical education in Saxony is\r\nshown by the fact that there are now in that kingdom the following\r\nschools: A technical high school in Dresden, a technical State institute\r\nat Chemnitz, and art schools in Dresden and Leipzig, also four builders'\r\nschools, two for the manufacture of toys, six for shipbuilders, three for\r\nbasket weavers, and fourteen for lace making. Besides these there are the\r\nfollowing trade schools supported by different trades, foundations,\r\nendowments, and districts: Two for decorative painting, one for\r\nwatchmakers, one for sheet metal workers, three for musical instrument\r\nmakers, one for druggists (not pharmacy), twenty-seven for weaving, one\r\nfor machine embroidery, two for tailors, one for barbers and hairdressers,\r\nthree for hand spinning, six for straw weaving, three for wood carving,\r\nfour for steam boiler heating, six for female handiwork. There are,\r\nmoreover, seventeen technical advanced schools, two for gardeners, eight\r\nagricultural, and twenty-six commercial schools.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Patrie reports, with apparent faith, an invention of Dr. Raydt, of\r\nHanover, who claims to have developed fully the utility of carbonic acid\r\nas a motive agent. Under the pressure of forty atmospheres this acid is\r\nreduced to a liquid state, and when the pressure is removed it evaporates\r\nand expands into a bulk 500 times as great as that it occupied before. It\r\nis by means of this double process that the Hanoverian chemist proposes to\r\nobtain such important benefits from the agent he employs. A quantity of\r\nthe fluid is liquified, and then stowed away in strong metal receptacles,\r\nsecurely fastened and provided with a duct and valve. By opening the valve\r\nfree passage is given to the gas, which escapes with great force, and may\r\nbe used instead of steam for working in a piston. One of the principal\r\nuses to which it has been put is to act as a temporary motive power for\r\nfire engines. Iron cases of liquified carbonic acid are fitted on to the\r\nboiler of the machine, and are always ready for use, so that while steam\r\nis being got up, and the engines can not yet be regularly worked in the\r\nusual way, the piston valves can be supplied with acid gas. There is,\r\nhowever, another remarkable object to which the new agent can be directed,\r\nand to which it has been recently applied in some experiments conducted at\r\nKiel. This is the floating of sunken vessels by means of artificial\r\nbladders. It has been found that a bladder or balloon of twenty feet\r\ndiameter, filled with air, will raise a mass of over 100 tons. Hitherto\r\nthese floats have been distended by pumping air into them through pipes\r\nfrom above by a cumbrous and tedious process, but Dr. Raydt merely affixes\r\na sufficient number of his iron gas-accumulators to the necks of the\r\nfloats to be used, and then by releasing the gas fills them at once with\r\nthe contents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAIRY SUPPLIES, Etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DAVIS SWING CHURN.\r\n\r\nThe Most Popular Churn on the Market.\r\n\r\n[Illustration of a swing churn]\r\n\r\nBecause it makes the most butter.

A great bane to the dairyman is\r\ncarbonic acid gas. In ill ventilated cellars it not only has a pernicious\r\neffect upon milk and its products, but it often renders the living\r\napartments unhealthful, and brings disease and death to the family. In the\r\ncourse of the discussion Mr. W. D. Hoard, President of the Northwestern\r\nDairymen's Association, related the following incident showing how easily\r\ncellars may be ventilated and rendered fit receptacles for articles of\r\nfood:\r\n\r\n\"In the city of Fort Atkinson, where I do reside, Mr. Clapp, the president\r\nof the bank told me that for twenty years he had been unable to keep any\r\nmilk or butter or common food of the family in the cellar. I went and\r\nlooked at it, and saw gathered on the sleepers above large beads of\r\nmoisture, and then knew what was the matter. The cellar was full of foul\r\nair. I said to him, 'Prof. Wilkins is here and will tell you in a few\r\nmoments how to remedy this difficulty, and make your cellar a clean and\r\nwholesome apartment of your house.' I went down and got the professor, and\r\nhe went up and looked at the cellar, and he says, 'for ten dollars I will\r\nput you in possession of a cellar that will be clean and wholesome.' He\r\nwent to work and took a four-inch pipe, made of galvanized iron, soldered\r\ntightly at the joints, passing it down the side of the cellar wall until\r\nit came within two inches of the bottom of the cellar, turned a square\r\nelbow at the top of the wall, carried it under the house, under the\r\nkitchen, up through the kitchen floor and into the kitchen chimney, about\r\nfour feet above where the kitchen stovepipe entered. You know the kitchen\r\nstove in all families is in operation about three times a day. The heat\r\nfrom this kitchen stove acting on the column of air in that little pipe\r\ncaused a vacuum, and nature abhors a vacuum, and the result was that in\r\ntwenty-four hours that little pipe had drawn the entire foul air out of\r\nthe cellar, and he has now a perfect cellar. I drop this hint to show you\r\nthat it is within easy reach of every one, for the sum of only about ten\r\ndollars, to have a perfectly ventilated cellar. This carbonic acid gas is\r\nvery heavy. It collects in the cellar and you can not get it out unless\r\nyou dip it out like water, or pump it out; and it becomes necessary to\r\napply something to it that shall operate in this way.\"\r\n\r\nThis is a matter of such importance, and yet so little thought about, that\r\nwe had designed having an illustration made to accompany this article, but\r\nconclude the arrangment is so simple that any one can go to work and adapt\r\nit to the peculiar construction of his own house, and we hope thousands\r\nwill make use of Mr. Hoard's suggestion.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn Old Roman Wedding.\r\n\r\nAs far as the nuptial ceremony itself was concerned, the Romans were in\r\nthe habit of celebrating it with many imposing rites and customs, some of\r\nwhich are still in use in this country. As soon, therefore, as the\r\nsooth-sayer had taken the necessary omens, the ceremony was commenced by a\r\nsheep being sacrificed to Juno, under whose special guardianship marriage\r\nwas supposed to rest. The fleece was next laid upon two chairs, on which\r\nthe bride and bridegroom sat, over whom prayers were then said. At the\r\nconclusion of the service the bride was led by three young men to the home\r\nof her husband. She generally took with her a distaff and spindle filled\r\nwith wool, indicative of the first work in her new married life--spinning\r\nfresh garments for her husband. Five torches were carried to light her.\r\n\r\nThe threshold of the house was gaily decorated with flowers and garlands;\r\nand in order to keep out infection it was anointed with certain unctuous\r\nperfumes. As a preservative, moreover, against sorcery and evil\r\ninfluences, it was disenchanted by various charms. After being thus\r\nprepared, the bride was lifted over the threshold, it being considered\r\nunlucky for her to tread across it on first entering her husband's house.\r\nThe musicians then struck up their music, and the company sang their\r\n\"Epithalamium.\" The keys of the house were then placed in the young wife's\r\nhands, symbolic of her now being mistress. A cake, too, baked by the\r\nvestal virgins, which had been carried before her in the procession from\r\nthe place of the marriage ceremony to the husband's home, was now divided\r\namong the guests. To enhance the merriment of the festive occasion, the\r\nbridegroom threw nuts among the boys, who then, as nowadays enjoyed\r\nheartily a grand scramble.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Smith's Stovepipe.\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there lived a certain man and wife, and their name--well,\r\nI think it must have been Smith, Mr. and Mrs. John Smith. One chilly day\r\nin October Mrs. Smith said to her husband: \"John, I really think we must\r\nhave the stove up in the sitting-room.\" And Mr. Smith from behind his\r\nnewspaper answered \"Well.\" Three hundred and forty-six times did Mr. and\r\nMrs. Smith repeat this conversation, and the three hundred and\r\nforty-seventh time Mr. Smith added: \"I'll get Brown to help me about it\r\nsome day.\"\r\n\r\nIt is uncertain how long the matter would have rested thus, had not Mrs.\r\nSmith crossed the street and asked neighbor Brown to come over and help\r\nher husband set up a stove, and as she was not his wife he politely\r\nconsented and came at once.\r\n\r\nWith a great deal of grunting, puffing, and banging, accompanied by some\r\nwords not usually mentioned in polite society, the two men at last got the\r\nstove down from the attic. Mrs. Smith had placed the zinc in its proper\r\nposition, and they put the stove way to one side of it, but of course that\r\ndidn't matter.\r\n\r\nThen they proceeded to put up the stovepipe. Mr. Smith pushed the knee\r\ninto the chimney, and Mr. Brown fitted the upright part to the stove. The\r\nnext thing was to get the two pieces to come together. They pushed and\r\npulled, they yanked and wrenched, they rubbed off the blacking onto their\r\nhands, they uttered remarks, wise and otherwise.\r\n\r\nPresently it occurred to Mr. Smith that a hammer was just the thing that\r\nwas needed, and he went for one. Mr. Brown improved the opportunity to\r\nwipe the perspiration from his noble brow, totally oblivious of the fact\r\nthat he thereby ornamented his severe countenance with several landscapes\r\ndone in stove blacking. The hammer didn't seem to be just the thing that\r\nwas needed, after all. Mr. Smith pounded until he had spoiled the shape of\r\nthe stovepipe, and still the pesky thing wouldn't go in, so he became\r\nexasperated and threw away the hammer. It fell on Mr. Brown's toe, and\r\nthat worthy man ejaculated--well, it's no matter what he ejaculated. Mr.\r\nSmith replied to his ejaculation, and then Mr. Brown went home.\r\n\r\nWhy continue the tale? Everybody knows that Mr. Smith, after making a\r\ngreat deal of commotion, finally succeeded in getting the pipe into place,\r\nthat he was perfectly savage to everybody for the rest of the day, and\r\nthat the next time he and Brown met on the street both were looking\r\nintently the other way.\r\n\r\nBut there is more to tell. It came to pass in the course of the winter\r\nthat the pipe needed cleaning out. Mrs. Smith dreaded the ordeal, both for\r\nher own sake and her husband's. It happened that the kitchen was presided\r\nover by that rarest of treasures, a good-natured, competent hired girl.\r\nThis divinity proposed that they dispense with Mr. Smith's help in\r\ncleaning out the pipe, and Mrs. Smith, with a sigh of relief, consented.\r\nThey carefully pulled the pipe apart, and, holding the pieces in a\r\nhorizontal position that no soot might fall on the carpet, carried it into\r\nthe yard.\r\n\r\nAfter they had swept out the pipe and carried it back they attempted to\r\nput it up. That must have been an unusually obstinate pipe, for it\r\nsteadily refused to go together. The minds of Mrs. Smith and her housemaid\r\nwere sufficiently broad to grasp this fact after a few trials; therefore\r\nthey did not waste their strength in vain attempts, but rested, and in an\r\nexceedingly un-masculine way held a consultation. The girl went for a\r\nhammer, and brought also a bit of board. She placed this on the top of the\r\npipe, raised her hammer, Mrs. Smith held the pipe in place below, two\r\nslight raps, and, lo, it was done.\r\n\r\nSee what a woman can do. This story is true, with the exception of the\r\nnames and a few other unimportant items. I say, and will maintain it, that\r\nas a general thing a woman has more brains and patience and less stupidity\r\nthan a man. I challenge any one to prove the contrary.--_N. E. Homestead._\r\n\r\n\r\nProgress.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a lecture on the resources of New Brunswick, Professor\r\nBrown, of the Ontario Agricultural College, told the following story by an\r\nArabian writer:\r\n\r\n\"I passed one day by a very rude and beautifully situated hamlet in a vast\r\nforest, and asked a savage whom I saw how long it had been there. 'It is\r\nindeed an old place,' replied he. 'We know it has stood there for 100 years\r\nas the hunting home of the great St. John, but how long previous to that\r\nwe do not know.'\r\n\r\n\"One century afterward, as I passed by the same place, I found a busy\r\nlittle city reaching down to the sea, where ships were loading timber for\r\ndistant lands. On asking one of the inhabitants how long this had\r\nflourished, he replied: 'I am looking to the future years, and not to what\r\nhas gone past, and have no time to answer such questions.'\r\n\r\n\"On my return there 100 years afterward, I found a very smoky and\r\nwonderfully-populous city, with many tall chimneys, and asked one of the\r\ninhabitants how long it had been founded. 'It is indeed a mighty city,'\r\nreplied he. 'We know not how long it has existed, and our ancestors there\r\non this subject are as ignorant as ourselves.'\r\n\r\n\"Another century after that as I passed by the same place, I found a much\r\ngreater city than before, but could not see the tall chimneys, and the air\r\nwas pure as crystal; the country to the north and the east and the west,\r\nwas covered with noble mansions and great farms, full of many cattle and\r\nsheep. I demanded of a peasant, who was reaping grain on the sands of the\r\nsea-shore, how long ago this change took place? 'In sooth, a strange\r\nquestion!' replied he. 'This ground and city have never been different\r\nfrom what you now behold them.' 'Were there not of old,' said I, 'many\r\ngreat manufacturers in this city?' 'Never,' answered he, 'so far as we\r\nhave seen, and never did our fathers speak to us of any such.'\r\n\r\n\"On my return there, 100 years afterward, I found the city was built\r\nacross the sea east-ward into the opposite country; there were no horses,\r\nand no smoke of any kind came from the dwellings.\r\n\r\n\"The inhabitants were traveling through the air on wires which stretched\r\nfar into the country on every side, and the whole land was covered with\r\nmany mighty trees and great vineyards, so that the noble mansions could\r\nnot be seen for the magnitude of the fruit thereof.\r\n\r\n\"Lastly, on coming back again, after an equal lapse of time, I could not\r\nperceive the slightest vestige of the city. I inquired of a very old and\r\nsaintly man, who appeared to be under deep emotion, and who stood alone\r\nupon the spot, how long it had been destroyed. 'Is this a question,' said\r\nhe, 'from a man like you? Know ye not that cities are not now part of the\r\nhuman economy? Every one travels through the air on wings of electricity,\r\nand lives in separate dwellings scattered all over the land; the ships of\r\nthe sea are driven by the same power, and go above or below as found to be\r\nbest for them. In the cultivation of the soil,' said he, 'neither horse\r\nnor steam-power are employed; the plow is not known, nor are fertilizers\r\nof any more value in growing the crops of the field. Electricity is\r\ncarried under the surface of every farm and all over-head like a net; when\r\nthe inhabitants require rain for any particular purpose, it is drawn down\r\nfrom the heavens by similar means. The influence of electricity has\r\ndestroyed all evil things, and removed all diseases from among men and\r\nbeasts, and every living thing upon the earth. All things have changed,\r\nand what was once the noble city of my name is to become the great meeting\r\nplace of all the leaders of science throughout the whole world.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\nA Family Jar.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Mrs. Gunkettle, as she spanked the baby in her calm, motherly\r\nway, \"it's a perfect shame, Mr. G., that you never bring me home anything\r\nto read! I might as well be shut up in a lunatic asylum.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think so, too,\" responded the unfeeling man.\r\n\r\n\"Other people,\" continued Mrs. Gunkettle, as she gave the baby a marble to\r\nswallow, to stop its noise, \"have magazines till they can't rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's one,\" said Mr. G., throwing a pamphlet on the table.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; a horrid old report of the fruit interests of Michigan; lots of\r\nnews in that!\" and she sat down on the baby with renewed vigor.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sure it's plum full of currant news of the latest dates,\" said the\r\nmiserable man. Mrs. Gunkettle retorted that she wouldn't give a fig for a\r\nwhole library of such reading, when 'apple-ly the baby shrieked loud\r\nenough to drown all other sounds, and peace was at once restored.\r\n\r\n\r\nMouce Traps and Other Sweetemetes.\r\n\r\nThe following advertisement is copied from the Fairfield Gazette of\r\nSeptember 21, 1786, or ninety-seven years ago, which paper was \"printed in\r\nFairfield by W.

Uncle Jim was a retired sea captain, sealer,\r\nand whaler, universally beloved and respected for his lovely disposition\r\nand genuine good-heartedness, not less than for the moderation of his\r\nstatements and the truthful candor of his narrations. It happened that one\r\nof the Yale Professors, who devoted himself to ethnological studies, was\r\ninterested in the Patagonians, and very much desired information as to the\r\nalleged gigantic stature of the race. A scientific friend, who knew the\r\nStonington romancer, told the Professor that he could no doubt get\r\nvaluable information from Uncle Jim, a Captain who was familiar with all\r\nthe region about Cape Horn. And the Professor, without any hint about\r\nUncle Jim's real ability, eagerly accompanied his friend to make the\r\nvisit. Uncle Jim was found in one of his usual haunts, and something like\r\nthe following ethnological conversation ensued:\r\n\r\nProfessor--They tell me, Capt. Pennington, that you have been a good deal\r\nin Patagonia.\r\n\r\nUncle Jim--Made thirty or forty voyages there, sir.\r\n\r\nProfessor--And I suppose you know something about the Patagonians and\r\ntheir habits?\r\n\r\nUncle Jim--Know all about 'em, sir. Know the Patagonians, sir, all, all of\r\n'em, as well as I know the Stonington folks.\r\n\r\nProfessor--I wanted to ask you, Captain, about the size of the\r\nPatagonians--whether they are giants, as travelers have reported?\r\n\r\nUncle Jim--No, sir--shaking his head slowly, and speaking with the modest\r\ntone of indifference--no, sir, they are not. (It was quite probable that\r\nthe Captain never had heard the suggestion before). The height of the\r\nPatagonian, sir, is just five feet nine inches and a half.\r\n\r\nProfessor--How did you ascertain this fact, Captain?\r\n\r\nUncle Jim--Measured 'em, sir--measured 'em. One day when the mate and I\r\nwere ashore down there, I called up a lot of the Patagonians, and the mate\r\nand I measured about 500 of them, and every one of them measured five feet\r\nnine inches and a half--that's their exact height.\r\n\r\nProfessor--That's very interesting. But, Captain, don't you suppose there\r\nwere giants there long ago, in the former generations? All the travelers\r\nsay so.\r\n\r\nUncle Jim--Not a word of truth in it, sir--not a word. I'd heard that\r\nstory and I thought I'd settle it. I satisfied myself there was nothing in\r\nit.\r\n\r\nProfessor--But how could you know that they used not to be giants? What\r\nevidence could you get? Mightn't the former race have been giants?\r\n\r\nUncle Jim--Impossible, sir, impossible.\r\n\r\nProfessor--But how did you satisfy yourself?\r\n\r\nUncle Jim--Dug 'em up, sir--dug 'em up speaking with more than usual\r\nmoderation. I'd heard that yarn. The next voyage, I took the bo'sen and\r\nwent ashore; we dug up 275 old Patagonians and measured 'em. They all\r\nmeasured exactly five feet nine inches and a half; no difference in\r\n'em--men, women, and all ages just the same. Five feet nine inches and a\r\nhalf is the natural height of a Patagonian. They've always been just that.\r\nNot a word of truth in the stories about giants, sir.--_Harper's\r\nMagazine_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPuddin' Tame's Fun.\r\n\r\n\"Nice child, very nice child,\" observed an old gentleman, crossing the\r\naisle and addressing the mother of the boy who had just hit him in the eye\r\nwith a wad of paper. \"How old are you, my son?\"\r\n\r\n\"None of your business,\" replied the youngster, taking aim at another\r\npassenger.\r\n\r\n\"Fine boy,\" smiled the old man, as the parent regarded her offspring with\r\npride. \"A remarkably fine boy. What is your name, my son?\"\r\n\r\n\"Puddin' Tame!\" shouted the youngster, with a giggle at his own wit.\r\n\r\n\"I thought so,\" continued the old man, pleasantly. \"If you had given me\r\nthree guesses at it, that would have been the first one I would have\r\nstruck on. Now, Puddin', you can blow those things pretty straight, can't\r\nyou?\"\r\n\r\n\"You bet!\" squealed the boy, delighted at the compliment. \"See me take\r\nthat old fellow over there!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" exclaimed the old gentleman, hastily. \"Try it on the old woman I\r\nwas sitting with. She has boys of her own, and she won't mind.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you hit the lady for the gentleman, Johnny?\" asked the fond parent.\r\n\r\nJohnny drew a bead and landed the pellet on the end of the old woman's\r\nnose. But she did mind it, and, rising in her wrath, soared down on the\r\nsmall boy like a blizzard. She put him over the line, reversed him, ran\r\nhim backward till he didn't know which end of him was front, and finally\r\ndropped him into the lap of the scared mother, with a benediction whereof\r\nthe purport was that she'd be back in a moment and skin him alive.\r\n\r\n\"She didn't seem to like it, Puddin',\" smiled the gentleman, softly.\r\n\"She's a perfect stranger to me, but I understand she is a matron of\r\ntruants' home, and I thought she would like a little fun; but I was\r\nmistaken.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the old gentleman sighed sweetly as he went back to his seat.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Alphabet.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the alphabet is at once the triumph, the instrument and\r\nthe register of the progress of our race. The oldest abecedarium in\r\nexistence is a child's alphabet on a little ink-bottle of black ware found\r\non the site of Cere, one of the oldest of the Greek settlements in Central\r\nItaly, certainly older than the end of the sixth century B. C. The\r\nPhoenician alphabet has been reconstructed from several hundred\r\ninscriptions. The \"Moabite Stone\" has yielded the honor of being the most\r\nancient of alphabetic records to the bronze plates found in Lebanon in\r\n1872, fixed as of the tenth or eleventh century, and therefore the\r\nearliest extant monuments of the Semitic alphabet. The lions of Nineveh\r\nand an inscribed scarab found at Khorsabad have furnished other early\r\nalphabets; while scarabs and cylinders, seals and gems, from Babylon and\r\nNineveh, with some inscriptions, are the scanty records of the first epoch\r\nof the Phoenician alphabet. For the second period, a sarcophagus found in\r\n1855, with an inscription of twenty-two lines, has tasked the skill of\r\nmore than forty of the most eminent Semitic scholars of the day, and the\r\nliterature connected with it is overwhelming. An unbroken series of coins\r\nextending over seven centuries from 522 B. C. to 153 A. D., Hebrew\r\nengraved gems, the Siloam inscription discovered in Jerusalem in 1880,\r\nearly Jewish coins, have each and all found special students whose\r\nsuccessive progress is fully detailed by Taylor. The Aramaean alphabet\r\nlived only for seven or eight centuries; but from it sprang the scripts of\r\nfive great faiths of Asia and the three great literary alphabets of the\r\nEast. Nineveh and its public records supply most curious revelations of\r\nthe social life and commercial transactions of those primitive times.\r\nLoans, leases, notes, sales of houses, slaves, etc., all dated, show the\r\ndevelopment of the alphabet. The early Egyptian inscriptions show which\r\nalphabet was there in the reign of Xerxes. Fragments on stone preserved in\r\nold Roman walls in Great Britain, Spain, France, and Jerusalem, all supply\r\nearly alphabets.\r\n\r\nAlphabets have been affected by religious controversies, spread by\r\nmissionaries, and preserved in distant regions by holy faith, in spite of\r\npersecution and perversion. The Arabic alphabet, next in importance after\r\nthe great Latin alphabet, followed in eighty years the widespread religion\r\nof Mohammed; and now the few Englishmen who can read and speak it are\r\nastonished to learn that it is collaterally related to our own alphabet,\r\nand that both can be traced back to the primitive Phoenician source.\r\n\r\nGreece alone had forty local alphabets, reduced by careful study to about\r\nhalf a dozen generic groups, characterized by certain common local\r\nfeatures, and also by political connection.\r\n\r\nOf the oldest \"a, b, c's\" found in Italy, several were scribbled by\r\nschool-boys on Pompeian walls, six in Greek, four in Oscan, four in Latin;\r\nothers were scratched on children's cups, buried with them in their\r\ngraves, or cut or painted for practice on unused portions of mortuary\r\nslabs. The earliest was found as late as 1882, a plain vase of black ware\r\nwith an Etruscan inscription and a syllabary or spelling exercise, and the\r\nGreek alphabet twice repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a Child Can Do.\r\n\r\n\"Pa, I have signed the pledge,\" said a little boy to his father, on coming\r\nhome one evening; \"will you help me keep it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said the father.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have brought a copy of the pledge; will you sign it, papa?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, nonsense, my child! What could I do when my brother-officers\r\ncalled--the father had been in the army--if I was a teetotaler?\"\r\n\r\n\"But do try, papa.\"\r\n\r\n\"Tut, tut! why you are quite a little radical.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, you won't ask me to pass the bottle, papa?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are quite a fanatic, my child; but I promise not to ask you to touch\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nSome weeks after that two officers called in to spend the evening.\r\n\r\n\"What have you to drink?\" said they.\r\n\r\n\"Have you any more of that prime Scotch ale?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said he; \"I have not, but I shall get some. Here, Willie, run to the\r\nstore, and tell them to send some bottles up.\"\r\n\r\nThe boy stood before his father respectfully, but did not go.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Willie; why, what's the matter? Come, run along.\" He went, but came\r\nback presently without any bottles.\r\n\r\n\"Where's the ale, Willie?\"\r\n\r\n\"I asked them for it at the store, and they put it upon the counter, but I\r\ncould not touch it. O pa, pa! don't be angry; I told them to send it up,\r\nbut I could not touch it myself!\"\r\n\r\nThe father was deeply moved, and turning to his brother-officers, he said:\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen, do you hear that? You can do as you please. When the ale comes\r\nyou may drink it, but not another drop shall be drank in my house, and not\r\nanother drop shall pass my lips. Willie, have you your temperance pledge?\"\r\n\r\n\"O pa! I have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bring it, then.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the boy was back with it in a moment. The father signed it and the\r\nlittle fellow clung round his father's neck with delight. The ale came,\r\nbut not one drank, and the bottles stood on the table untouched.\r\n\r\nChildren, sign the pledge, and ask your parents to help you keep it. Don't\r\ntouch the bottle, and try to keep others from touching it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nStock Farms FOR SALE; one of the very best in Central Illinois, the\r\nfinest agricultural region in the world; 1,100 acres, highly improved;\r\nunusual facilities for handling stock; also a smaller farm; also one of\r\nthe finest\r\n\r\nStock Ranches In Central Texas, 9,136 acres.

It was a clever picture, but everything\r\nFrank Dobb did was clever, from his painting to his banjo playing. Clever\r\nwas the true name for it, for of substantial merit it possessed none. He\r\nhad begun to paint without learning to draw, and he could pick a tune out\r\nof any musical instrument extant without ever having mastered the\r\nmysteries of notes. He talked the most graceful of airy nothings, and\r\ncould not cover a page of note paper without his orthography going lame,\r\nand all the rest of his small acquirements and accomplishments were\r\nproportionately shallow and incomplete. Paternal partiality laid it to his\r\nbeing too gifted to study, but the cold logic, which no ties of\r\nconsanguinity influenced, ascribed it to laziness.\r\n\r\nFrank was, indeed, the idlest and best-natured fellow in the world. You\r\nnever saw him busy, angry, or out of spirits. He painted a little,\r\nthrummed his guitar a little longer or rattled a tune off on his piano,\r\nsmoked and read a great deal, and flirted still more, all in the same\r\ndeliberate and easy-going way. Any excuse was sufficient to absolve him\r\nfrom serious work. So he lead a pleasant, useless life, with Dobb senior\r\nto pay the bills.\r\n\r\nHe had the handsomest studio in New York, a studio for one of Ouida's\r\nheroes to luxuriate in. If the encouragement of picturesque surroundings\r\ncould have made a painter of him he would have been a master. The fame of\r\nhis studio, and the fact that he did not need the money, made his pictures\r\nsell. He was quite a lion in society, and it was regarded as a favor to be\r\nasked to call on him. He was the beau ideal of the artist of romance, and\r\nwas accorded a romantic eminence accordingly. So, with his pictures to\r\nprovide him with pocket money, and his father to see to the rest, he lived\r\nthe life of a young prince, feted and flattered and spoiled, artistically\r\ndespised by all the serious workers who knew him, and hated by some who\r\nenvied him the commercial success he had no necessity for, but esteemed by\r\nmost of us as a good fellow and his own worst enemy.\r\n\r\nFrank married his first wife while Dobb senior was still at the helm of\r\nhis own affairs. She was a charming little woman whose acquaintance he had\r\nmade when she visited his studio with a party of friends. She had not a\r\npenny, but he made a draft upon \"the governor,\" as he called him, and the\r\nhappy pair digested their honeymoon in Europe. They were absent six\r\nmonths, during which time he did not set brush to canvas. Then they\r\nreturned, as he fancifully termed it, to go to work.\r\n\r\nHe commenced the old life as if he had never been married. The familiar\r\nsound of pipes and beer, and supper after the play, often with young\r\nladies who had been assisting in the representation on the stage, was\r\ntraveled as if there had been no Mrs. Dobb at home in the flat old Dobb\r\nprovided. Frank's expenditures on himself were as lavish as they had been\r\nin his bachelor days. As little Brown said, it was lucky that Mrs. Dobb\r\nhad a father-in-law to buy her dinner for her. She rarely came to her\r\nhusband's studio, because he claimed that it interfered with the course of\r\nbusiness. He had invented a fiction that she was too weak to endure the\r\nstrain of society, and so he took her into it as little as possible. In\r\nbrief, married by the caprice of a selfish man, the poor little woman\r\nlived through a couple of neglected years, and then died of a malady as\r\nnearly akin to a broken heart as I can think of, while Frank was making a\r\ntrip to the Bahamas on the yacht of his friend Munnybagge, of the Stock\r\nExchange.\r\n\r\nHe had set out on the voyage ostensibly to make studies, for he was a\r\nmarine painter, on the principle, probably, that marines are easiest to\r\npaint. When he came back and found his wife dead, he announced that he\r\nwould move his studio to Havana for the purpose of improving his art. He\r\ndid so, putting off his mourning suit the day after he left New York and\r\nnot putting it on again, as the evidence of creditable witnesses on the\r\nsteamer and in Havana has long since proved.\r\n\r\nHis son's callousness was a savage stab in old Dobb's heart. A little,\r\nmild-looking old gentleman, without a taint of selfishness or suspicion in\r\nhis own nature, he had not seen the effect of his indulgence of him on his\r\nson till his brutal disregard for his first duty as a man had told him of\r\nit. The old man had appreciated and loved his daughter-in-law. In\r\nproportion as he had discovered her unhappiness and its just cause, he had\r\nlost his affection for his son. I hear that there was a terrible scene\r\nwhen Frank came home, a week after his wife had been buried. He claimed to\r\nhave missed the telegram announcing her death to him at Nassau, but\r\nMunnybagge had already told some friends that he had got the dispatch in\r\ntime for the steamer, but had remained over till the next one, because he\r\nhad a flirtation on hand with little Gonzales, the Cuban heiress, and old\r\nDobb had heard of it. Munnybagge never took him yachting again; and,\r\nspeaking to me once about him, he designated him, not by name, but as\r\n\"that infernal bloodless cad.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, as I have said, there was a desperate row between father and son,\r\nand Frank is said to have slunk out of the house like a whipped cur, and\r\nbeen quite dull company at the supper which he took after the opera that\r\nnight in Gillian Trussell's jolly Bohemian flat. When he emigrated, with\r\nhis studio traps filling half a dozen packing cases, none of the boys\r\nbothered to see him off. They had learned to see through his good\r\nfellowship, and recalled a poor little phantom, to whose life and\r\nhappiness he had been a wicked and bitter enemy.\r\n\r\nAbout a year after his departure I read the announcement in the Herald of\r\nthe marriage of Franklin D. Dobb, Sr., to a widow well-known and popular\r\nin society. I took the trouble to ascertain that it was Frank's father,\r\nand being among some of the boys that night, mentioned it to them.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" remarked Smith, \"that's really queer. You remember Frank left some\r\nthings in my care when he went away? Yesterday I got a letter asking about\r\nthem, and informing me that he had got married and was coming home.\"\r\n\r\nHe did come home, and he settled in his old studio. What sort of a meeting\r\nhe had with his father this time I never heard. The old gentleman had been\r\npaying him his allowance regularly while he was away, and I believe he\r\nkept up the payment still. But otherwise he gave him no help, and if he\r\never needed help he did now.\r\n\r\nHis wife was a Cuban, as pretty and as helpless as a doll. She had been an\r\nheiress till her brother had turned rebel and had his property\r\nconfiscated. Unfortunately for Frank, he had married her before the\r\nculmination of this catastrophe. In fact, he had been paying court to her\r\nwith the dispatch announcing his wife's death in his pocket, and had\r\nmarried her long before the poor little clay was well settled in the grave\r\nhe had sent it to. In marrying her he had evidently believed he was\r\nestablishing his future. So he was, but it was a future of expiation for\r\nthe sins and omissions of his past.\r\n\r\nThe new Mrs. Dobb was a tigress in her love and her jealousy. She was\r\nchildish and ignorant, and adored her husband as a man and an artist. She\r\nmeasured his value by her estimation of him, and was on the watch\r\nperpetually for trespassers on her domain. The domestic outbreaks between\r\nthe two were positively blood curdling. One afternoon, I remember, Gillian\r\nTrussell, who had heard of his return, called on him. Mrs. D. met her at\r\nthe studio door, told her, \"Frank,\" as she called him, was out; slammed\r\nthe door in her face, and then flew at him with a palette scraper. We had\r\nto break the door in, and found him holding her off by both wrists, and\r\nshe frothing in a mad fit of hysterics. From that day he was a changed\r\nman. She owned him body and soul.\r\n\r\nThe life the pair lived after that was simply ridiculously miserable. He\r\nhad lost his old social popularity, and was forced to sell his pictures to\r\nthe cheap dealers, when he was lucky enough to sell them at all. The\r\npaternal allowance would not support the flat they first occupied, and\r\nthey went into a boarding house. Inside of a month they were in the\r\npapers, on account of outbreaks on Mrs. Dobb's part against one of the\r\nladies of the house. A couple of days after he leased a little room\r\nopening into his studio, converted it into a bed-room, and they settled\r\nthere for good.\r\n\r\nSuch a housekeeping as it was--like a scene in a farce. The studio had\r\nlong since run to seed, and a perpetual odor of something to eat hung over\r\nit along with the sickening reek of the Florida water Mrs. D., like all\r\nother creoles, made more liberal use of than of the pure element it was\r\nhalf-named from. Crumbs and crusts and chop-bones, which the dog had left,\r\nlittered the rugs; and I can not recall the occasion on which the\r\ncaterer's tin box was not standing at the door, unless it was when the\r\ndirty plates were piled up, there waiting for him to come for them. I\r\ndined there once. Frank had had a savage quarrel with her that day, and\r\nwanted me for a bender. But the scheme availed him nothing, for she broke\r\nout over the soup and I left them to fight it out, and finished my feast\r\nat a chop house.\r\n\r\nAll of his old flirtations came back to curse him now. His light loves of\r\nthe playhouse and his innocent devotions of the ball room were alike the\r\ninstruments fate had forged into those of punishment for him. The very\r\nnames of his old fancies, which, with that subtle instinct all women\r\npossess, she had found out, were sufficient to send his wife into a\r\nfrenzy. She was a chronic theatre-goer, and they never went to the theatre\r\nwithout bringing a quarrel home with them. If he was silent at the play\r\nshe charged him with neglecting her; if he brisked up and tried to chat,\r\nher jealousy would soon pick out some casus belli in the small talk he\r\nstrove to interest her with. A word to a passing friend, a glance at one\r\nof her own sex, was sufficient to set her going. I shall never question\r\nthat jealousy is a form of actual madness, after what I saw of it in the\r\nlives of that miserable man and woman.\r\n\r\nA year after his return he was the ghost of his old self. He was haggard\r\nand often unshaven; his attire was shabby and carelessly put on; he had\r\nlost his old, jaunty air, and went by you with a hurried pace, and his\r\nhead and shoulders bent with an indescribable suggestion of humility. The\r\nfear of having her break out, regardless of any one who might be by, which\r\nhung over him at home, haunted him out of doors, too. The avenger of Mrs.\r\nDobb the first had broken his spirit as effectually as he had broken Mrs.\r\nDobb's heart. Smith occupied the next studio to him, and one evening I was\r\nsmoking there, when an atrocious uproar commenced in the next room. We\r\ncould distinguish Frank's voice and his wife's, and another strange one.\r\nSmith looked at me, grinned, and shrugged his shoulders. The disturbance\r\nceased in a couple of minutes, and a door banged.\r\n\r\nThen came a crash, a shrill and furious scream, and the sound of feet. We\r\nran to the door, in time to see Mrs. Dobb, her hair in a tangle down her\r\nback, in a dirty wrapper and slipshod slippers, stumbling down stairs. We\r\nposted after her, Smith nearly breaking his neck by tripping over one of\r\nthe slippers which she had shed as she ran. The theatres were just out and\r\nthe streets full of people, among whom she jostled her way like the mad\r\nwoman that she was. We came up with her as she overtook her husband, who\r\nwas walking with McGilp, the dealer who handled his pictures. She seized\r\nhim by the arm and screamed out:\r\n\r\n\"I told you I would come with you.\"\r\n\r\nHis face for a moment was the face of a devil, full of fury and despair. I\r\nsaw his fist clench itself and the big vein in his forehead swell. But he\r\nslipped his hands into his pockets, looked appealingly at McGilp, and\r\nsaid, shrugging his shoulders, \"You see how it is, Mac?\"\r\n\r\nMcGilp nodded and walked abruptly away, with a look full of contempt and\r\nscorn. We mingled with the crowd and saw the poor wretches go off\r\ntogether, he grim and silent, she hysterically excited--with all the world\r\nstaring at them. Smith slept on a lounge in my room that night. \"I\r\ncouldn't get a wink up there,\" he said, \"and I don't want to be even the\r\near witness of a murder.\"\r\n\r\nThe night did not witness the tragedy he anticipated, though. Next day,\r\nFrank Dobb came to see me--a compliment he had not paid me for months. He\r\nwas the incarnation of abject misery, and so nervous that he could\r\nscarcely speak intelligibly.\r\n\r\n\"I saw you in the crowd last night, old man,\" he said, looking at the\r\nfloor and twisting and untwisting his fingers. \"What do you think of it? A\r\nnice life for a fellow to lead, eh?\"\r\n\r\nWhat else could I reply than, \"Why do you lead it then?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" he repeated, breaking into a hollow, uneasy laugh. \"Why, because I\r\nlove her, damn me! and I deserve it all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is this what you came to tell me?\" I asked.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he answered, \"of course not. The fact is, I want you to help me out\r\nof a hole. That row last night has settled me with McGilp. He came to see\r\nme about a lot of pictures for a sale he is getting up out West, and the\r\nsenora kept up such a nagging that he got sick and suggested that we\r\nshould go to 'The Studio' for a chop and settle the business there. She\r\nswore I shouldn't go, and that she would follow us if I did. I thought\r\nshe'd not go that far; but she did. So the McGilp affair is off for good,\r\nI know. He's disgusted, and I don't blame him. What I want of you is this.\r\nBuy that Hoguet you wanted last year.\"\r\n\r\nThe picture was one I had fancied and offered him a price for in his palmy\r\ndays, one that he had picked up abroad. I was only too glad to take it and\r\na couple more, for which I paid him at once; and next evening, at dinner,\r\nI heard that he had levanted. \"Walked out this morning,\" said Smith, \"and\r\nsent a messenger an hour after with word that he had already left the\r\ncity. She came in to me with the letter in one hand and a dagger in the\r\nother. She swears he has run away with another woman, and says she's going\r\nto have her life, if she has to follow her around the world.\"\r\n\r\nShe did not carry out her sanguinary purpose, though. There were some\r\nconsultations with old Dobb and then the studio was to let again. Some one\r\ntold me she had returned to Cuba, where she proposed to live on the\r\nallowance her father-in-law had made her husband and which he now\r\ncontinued to her.\r\n\r\nI had almost forgotten her when, several years later, in the lobby of the\r\nAcademy of Music, she touched my arm with her fan. She was promenading on\r\nthe arm of a handsome but beefy-looking Englishman, whom she introduced to\r\nme as her husband. I had not heard of a divorce, but I took the\r\nintroduction as information that there had been one. The Englishman was a\r\nbetter fellow than he looked. We supped together after the opera, and I\r\nlearned that he had met Mrs. Dobb in Havana, where he had spent some years\r\nin business. I found her a changed woman--a new woman, indeed, in whom I\r\nonly now and then caught a glimpse of her old indolent, babyish and\r\nfoolish self. She was not only prettier than ever, but she had become a\r\nsensible and clever woman. The influence of an intelligent man, who was\r\nstrong enough to bend her to his ways, had developed her latent brightness\r\nand taught her to respect herself as well as him.\r\n\r\nI met her several times after that, and at the last meeting but one she\r\nspoke of Frank for the first time. Her black eyes snapped when she uttered\r\nhis name. The devil was alive in them, though love was dead.\r\n\r\nI told her that I had heard nothing of him since his disappearance.\r\n\r\n\"But I have,\" she said, showing her white teeth in a curious smile.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" I replied, quite astounded.\r\n\r\n\"The coward!\" she went on bitterly; \"and to think I could ever have loved\r\nsuch a thing as he! Do you know, Mr. X., that I never knew he had been\r\nmarried till after he had fled? Then his father told me how he had courted\r\nmy father's money, with his wife lying dead at home. Oh! Senor Francisco,\r\nSenor Francisco! Before I heard that, I wanted to kill the woman who had\r\nstolen you from me. The moment after I could have struck you dead at my\r\nfeet.\"\r\n\r\nShe threw her arm up, holding her fan like a dagger. I believed her, and\r\nso would any one who had seen her then.\r\n\r\n\"I had hardly settled in Havana,\" she continued, \"before I received a\r\nletter from him. Already he wanted to come back to me. Had the other woman\r\ntired of him already? I asked myself, or was it really true, as his father\r\nhad told me, that he had fled alone? I answered the letter, and he wrote\r\nagain. Again I answered, and so it was kept up. For two years I played\r\nwith the love I now knew was worthless. He was traveling round the world,\r\nand a dozen times wanted to come directly to me. I insisted that he should\r\nkeep his journey up--as a probation, you see. He submitted. But oh! how he\r\ndid love me!\"\r\n\r\nThe exultation with which she told this was absolutely fiendish. I could\r\nsee in it, plainer than any words could tell it to me, the scheme of\r\nvengeance she had carried out, the alternating hopes and torments to which\r\nshe had raised, and into which she had plunged him. I could see him\r\nwandering around the globe, scourged by remorses, agonized by doubts, and\r\nmaddened by despairs, accepting the lies she wrote him as inviolable\r\npledges, and sustaining himself with the vision of a future never to be\r\nfulfilled. She read the expression of my face, and laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Was it not an idea?\" she asked. \"Was that not better than this?\"\r\n\r\nAnd again she stabbed the air with her fan.\r\n\r\n\"But--pardon me the question--but you have begun the confidence,\" I said.\r\n\"How will it end?\"\r\n\r\n\"It has ended,\" she answered.\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had been divorced while I was writing to him. A year ago he was to be\r\nin London, where I was to meet him. While he was sailing from the Cape of\r\nGood Hope I was being married to a man who loved me for myself, and to\r\nwhom I had confided all. Instead of my address at the London post office\r\nhe received a notification of my marriage, addressed to him in my own hand\r\nand mailed to him by myself. He wrote once or twice still, but my husband\r\nindorsed the letters with his own name and returned them unopened. He may\r\nbe dead for all I know, but I hope and pray he is still alive, and will\r\nremain alive and love me for a thousand years.\"\r\n\r\nShe opened her arms, as if to hug her vengeance to her heart, and looked\r\nat me steadily with eyes that thrilled me with their lambent fire. No\r\nwonder the wretched vagabond loved her! What a doom his selfishness and\r\nhis duplicity had invoked upon him! I believe if he could have seen her as\r\nI saw her then, so different from and better than he knew her to be, he\r\nwould have gone mad on the spot. Poor Mrs. Dobb the first was indeed\r\navenged.\r\n\r\nWe sipped our chocolate and talked of other things, as if such a being as\r\nFrank Dobb had never been. Her husband joined us and we made an evening of\r\nit at the theatre. I knew from the way he looked at me, and from the\r\nincreased warmth of his manner, that he was conversant with his wife's\r\nhaving made a confidant of me. But I do not think he knew how far her\r\nconfidence had gone. I have often wondered since if he knew how deep and\r\nfierce the hatred she carried for his predecessor was. There are things\r\nwomen will reveal to strangers which they will die rather than divulge to\r\nthose they love.\r\n\r\nI saw them off to Europe, for they were going to establish themselves in\r\nLondon, and I have never seen or directly heard from them since. But some\r\nmonths after their departure I received a letter from Robinson, who has\r\nbeen painting there ever since his picture made that great hit in the\r\nSalon of '7--.\r\n\r\n\"I have odd news for you,\" he wrote. \"You remember Frank Dobb, who\r\nbelonged to our old Pen and Pencil Club, and who ran away from that Cuban\r\nwife of his just before I left home? Well, about a year ago I met him in\r\nFleet street, the shabbiest beggar you ever saw. He was quite tight and\r\nsmelled of gin across the street. He was taking a couple of drawings to a\r\npenny dreadful office which he was making pictures for at ten shillings a\r\npiece. I went to see him once, in the dismalest street back of Drury Lane.\r\nHe was doing some painting for a dealer, when he was sober enough, and of\r\nall the holes you ever saw his was it. I soon had to sit down on him, for\r\nhe got into the habit of coming to see me and loafing around, making the\r\nstudio smell like a pub, till I would lend him five shillings to go away.\r\nI heard nothing of him till the other day I came across an event which\r\nthis from the Telegraph will explain.\"\r\n\r\nThe following newspaper paragraph was appended:\r\n\r\n\"The man who shot himself on the door-step of Mr. Bennerley Green, the\r\nWest India merchant, last Monday, has been discovered to be an American\r\nwho for some time has been employed furnishing illustrations to the lower\r\norder of publications here.

He is stated to be the son of a wealthy New\r\nYorker, who discarded him in consequence of his habits of dissipation, and\r\nto have once been an artist of considerable prominence in the United\r\nStates.
