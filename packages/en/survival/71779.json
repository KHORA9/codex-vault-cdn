JOHNSON AND CO.\r\n                             PHILADELPHIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy has the beneficent Creator scattered over the face of the earth such\r\na profusion of beautiful flowers--flowers by the thousand and million,\r\nin every land--from the tiny snowdrop that gladdens the chill spring of\r\nthe north, to the gorgeous magnolia that flaunts in the sultry regions\r\nof the tropics? Why is it that every landscape has its appropriate\r\nflowers, every nation its national flowers, every rural home its home\r\nflowers? Why do flowers enter and shed their perfume over every scene of\r\nlife, from the cradle to the grave? Why are flowers made to utter all\r\nvoices of joy and sorrow in all varying scenes, from the chaplet that\r\nadorns the bride to the votive wreath that blooms over the tomb?\r\n\r\nIt is for no other reason than that flowers have in themselves a real\r\nand natural significance. They have a positive relation to man, his\r\nsentiments, passions, and feelings. They correspond to actual emotions.\r\nThey have their mission--a mission of love and mercy. They have their\r\nlanguage, and from the remotest ages this language has found its\r\ninterpreters.\r\n\r\nIn the East the language of flowers has been universally understood and\r\napplied “time out of mind.” Its meaning finds a place in their poetry\r\nand in all their literature, and it is familiarly known among the\r\npeople. In Europe it has existed and been recognised for long ages among\r\nthe people, although scarcely noticed by the literati until a\r\ncomparatively recent period. Shakspeare, however, whom nothing escaped\r\nwhich was known to the people, exhibits his intimate acquaintance with\r\nthe language of flowers in his masterly delineation of the madness of\r\nOphelia.\r\n\r\nRecent writers in all languages recognise the beauty and propriety of\r\nthis language to such an extent, that an acquaintance with it has now\r\nbecome indispensable as a part of a polished education.\r\n\r\nOur little volume is devoted to the explanation of this beautiful\r\nlanguage. We have made it as complete as our materials and limits would\r\npermit. We present it to our readers in the humble hope that we shall\r\nincrease the means of elegant and innocent enjoyment by our “Floral\r\nOffering.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nContents.\r\n\r\n\r\n

please._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis shrub, clothed in its showy garb, appears amidst the snow, like an\r\nimprudent and coquettish female, who, though shivering with cold, wears\r\nher spring attire in the depth of winter. The stalk of this shrub is\r\ncovered with a dry bark, which gives it the appearance of dead wood.\r\nNature, to hide this deformity, has encircled each of its sprays with a\r\nwreath of red flowers, terminating in a tuft of leaves. These flowers\r\ngive out a peculiar and offensive smell.\r\n\r\n  You oftentimes can mark upon the street\r\n    The gilded toy whom fashion idolizes;\r\n  Heartless and fickle, swelled with self-conceit,\r\n    Avoiding alway what good sense advises.\r\nWho flutters like the butterfly while burns his sun,\r\nNor afterwards is missed when life is done.\r\n\r\n_W.

The north winds howl; the naked branches of the\r\ntrees are white with frost; the earth is carpeted with the virgin snow;\r\nthe feathered musicians are silent; and stern Winter’s icy hand chills\r\nthe rivulet till it ceases to murmur. At this season, a tender flower\r\nsprings up amid the snow, expands its blossoms, and leads thought to the\r\nverdant hours to come. This beautiful sign of awakening Nature may aptly\r\nbe considered as the emblem of Hope.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The Snowdrop, winter’s timid child,\r\n      Awakes to life bedewed with tears,\r\n    And flings around its fragrance mild;\r\n    And, where no rival flowerets bloom,\r\n    Amidst the bare and chilling gloom\r\n      A beauteous gem appears.\r\n    All weak and wan, with head inclined,\r\n      Its parent breast the drifted snow,\r\n    It trembles, while the ruthless wind\r\n    Bends its slim form; the tempest lowers,\r\n    Its emerald eye drops crystal showers\r\n      On its cold bed below.\r\n    Where’er I find thee, gentle flower,\r\n      Thou still art sweet and dear to me;\r\n    For I have known the cheerless hour,\r\n    Have seen the sunbeams cold and pale,\r\n    Have felt the chilling wintry gale,\r\n      And wept and shrunk, like thee!\r\n\r\n    _Mary Robinson._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    No one is so accursed by fate,\r\n    No one so utterly desolate,\r\n      But some heart, though unknown,\r\n      Responds unto his own;\r\n    Responds, as if with unseen wings\r\n    An angel touched its quivering strings,\r\n      And whispers in its song,\r\n      “Where hast thou stayed so long?”\r\n\r\n    _Longfellow._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The star of Hope will beam in Sorrow’s night,\r\n    And smile the phantoms of Despair to flight.\r\n\r\n    _Anon._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    “Why do you call the Snowdrop pale,\r\n      Our first of flowerets bright?\r\n    For the Christmas Rose came long before,\r\n      So did the Aconite.”\r\n    I know the yellow Aconite;\r\n      I know the Christmas Rose:\r\n    But neither one nor other e’er\r\n      Within my garden grows.\r\n    They seem to me presumptuous things,\r\n      That rudely hurry on,\r\n    And struggle for the precedence\r\n      A fairer flower hath won.\r\n    When I was but a wee, wee thing,\r\n      A young Snowdrop I nursed,\r\n    And I loved it when they told me how\r\n      It always blossomed first.\r\n    I marked its tiny, trembling stem,\r\n      And dainty little bell,\r\n    And, oh! so tenderly enjoyed\r\n      Its faint, delicious smell.\r\n    It was not only fair and sweet,\r\n      ’Twas the first flower that came;\r\n    So said they then, and there is none\r\n      I could love now the same.\r\n    The Aconite may deck with gold\r\n      Its merry little face--\r\n    The Christmas Rose at Christmas bloom,\r\n      But none can fill _her_ place.\r\n    Within my garden’s small domain\r\n      The Snowdrop still shall find\r\n    Herself the earliest flower.

It was anciently\r\ncalled Paralisos, the name of a beautiful youth, who died of grief for\r\nthe loss of his betrothed Melicerta, and was metamorphosed by his\r\nparents into this flower, which has since been a favourite of the poets.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                        With fairest flowers,\r\n    Whilst summer last, and I live here, Fidele,\r\n    I’ll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack\r\n    The flower that’s like thy face, pale Primrose.\r\n\r\n    _Cymbeline._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The Primrose pale is Nature’s meek and modest child.\r\n\r\n    _Balfour._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Nay, weep not while thy sun shines bright,\r\n      And cloudless is thy day,\r\n    While past and present joys unite\r\n      To cheer thee on thy way;\r\n    While fond companions round thee move,\r\n      To youth and nature true,\r\n    And friends whose looks of anxious love\r\n      Thy every step pursue.\r\n\r\n    _Common-Place Book of Poetry._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The Primrose, tenant of the glade,\r\n    Emblem of virtue in the shade.\r\n\r\n    _John Mayne._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Ask me why I send you here\r\n    This firstling of the infant year;\r\n    Ask me why I send to you\r\n    This Primrose all bepearled with dew:\r\n    I straight will whisper in your ears,\r\n    The sweets of love are washed with tears.\r\n    Ask me why this flower doth show\r\n    So yellow, green, and sickly too;\r\n    Ask me why the stalk is weak\r\n    And bending, yet it doth not break:\r\n    I must tell you these discover\r\n    What doubts and fears are in a lover.\r\n\r\n    _Thomas Carew._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    By the soft green light in the woody glade,\r\n    On the banks of moss where thy childhood played,\r\n    By the household tree through which thine eye\r\n    First looked in love to the summer sky;\r\n    By the dewy gleam, by the very breath\r\n    Of the Primrose-tufts in the grass beneath,\r\n    Upon thy heart there is laid a spell,\r\n    Holy and precious--oh, guard it well!\r\n    Yes! when thy heart in its pride would stray\r\n    From the first pure loves of its youth away;\r\n    When the sullying breath of the world would come\r\n    O’er the flowers it brought from its native home;\r\n    Think thou again of the woody glade,\r\n    Of the sound by the rustling ivy made;\r\n    Think of the tree at thy father’s door,\r\n    And the kindly spell shall have power once more.\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. Hemans._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALMOND BLOSSOM. ... _Indiscretion._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Almond tree is the first of the trees to put forth its blossoms,\r\nwhen spring breathes the breath of life through nature. It has been made\r\nthe emblem of indiscretion, from flowering so early that frosts too\r\noften give a death-chill to the precocious germs of its fruit. In\r\nancient times, the abundance of blossoms upon the Almond tree was\r\nconsidered to promise a fruitful season. The following is the fabulous\r\naccount of the origin of this tree:--Demophoon, son of Theseus and\r\nPhædra, in returning from the siege of Troy, was thrown by a storm on\r\nthe shores of Thrace, where then reigned the beautiful Phyllis. The\r\nyoung queen graciously received the prince, fell in love with him, and\r\nbecame his wife. When recalled to Athens by his father’s death,\r\nDemophoon promised to return in a month, and fixed the day. The loving\r\nPhyllis counted the hours of his absence, and, at last, the appointed\r\nday arrived. Nine times she repaired to the shore; but, losing all hope\r\nof his return, she died of grief, and was converted into an Almond tree.\r\nSoon afterwards, Demophoon returned. Overwhelmed with sorrow, he offered\r\na sacrifice at the sea-side, to appease the manes of his bride. The\r\nAlmond tree instantly put forth its blossoms, and seemed to sympathize\r\nwith his repentance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Oh! had I nursed when I was young\r\n    The lessons of my father’s tongue,\r\n    (The deep laborious thoughts he drew\r\n    From all he saw, and others knew,)\r\n    I might have been,--ah, me!\r\n    Thrice sager than I e’er shall be.\r\n              For what says Time?\r\n    Alas! he only shows the truth\r\n    Of all that I was told in youth.\r\n\r\n    _Barry Cornwall._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCROCUS. ... _Youth._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Crocus is one of the earliest of the spring flowers, and, therefore,\r\na fit emblem of the spring of life. It is a small flower, of variegated\r\nhues; the principal being purple, yellow, and white. The _Crocus\r\nVernus_, or Spring Crocus, is a wild flower now in various parts of\r\nEngland, though not considered to be really a native of the country. We\r\nlearn from the favourite writers, Mr. and Mrs. Howitt, that they are\r\nplentiful about Nottingham, “gleaming at a distance like a perfect flood\r\nof lilac, and tempting very many little hearts, and many graver ones\r\ntoo, to go out and gather.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Oh! many a glorious flower there grows\r\n      In far and richer lands;\r\n    But high in my affection e’er\r\n      The beautiful Crocus stands.\r\n    I love their faces, when by one\r\n      And two they’re looking out;\r\n    I love them when the spreading field\r\n      Is purple all about.\r\n    I loved them in the by-gone years\r\n      Of childhood’s thoughtless laughter,\r\n    When I marvelled why the flowers came first,\r\n      And the leaves the season after.\r\n    I loved them then, I love them now--\r\n      The gentle and the bright;\r\n    I love them for the thoughts they bring\r\n      Of spring’s returning light;\r\n    When, first-born of the waking earth,\r\n      Their kindred gay appear,\r\n    And, with the Snowdrop, usher in\r\n      The hope-invested year.\r\n\r\n    _Louisa A.

The gorgeousness of the\r\nflower of the Cactus needs no eulogy.

Its quiet beauty and love of retired spots have\r\never made it the emblem of true worth that shrinks from parade. It is\r\none of the first children of spring, and awakens pleasing emotions in\r\nthe breast of the lover of the beautiful, as he strolls through the\r\nmeadows in the season of joy. Ion, the Greek name of this flower, is\r\ntraced by some etymologists to Ia, the daughter of Midas, who was\r\nbetrothed to Atys, and changed by Diana into a Violet, to hide her from\r\nApollo.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    A woman’s love, deep in the heart,\r\n      Is like the Violet flower,\r\n    That lifts its modest head apart\r\n      In some sequestered bower.\r\n\r\n    _Anon._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The maid whose manners are retired,\r\n    Who, patient, waits to be admired,\r\n    Though overlooked, perhaps, a while\r\n    Her modest worth, her modest smile,--\r\n    Oh, she will find, or soon, or late,\r\n    A noble, fond, and faithful mate,\r\n    Who, when the spring of life is gone,\r\n    And all its blooming flowers are flown,\r\n    Will bless old Time, who left behind\r\n    The graces of a virtuous mind.\r\n\r\n    _Paulding._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Pansies, Lilies, Kingcups, Daisies,\r\n    Let them live upon their praises;\r\n    Long as there’s a sun that sets,\r\n      Primroses will have their glory;\r\n    Long as there are Violets,\r\n      They will have a place in story:\r\n    There’s a flower that shall be mine,\r\n    ’Tis the little Celandine.\r\n    Eyes of some men travel far\r\n    For the finding of a star;\r\n    Up and down the heavens they go,\r\n      Men that keep a mighty rout!\r\n    I’m as great as they, I trow,\r\n      Since the day I found thee out,\r\n    Little flower!--I’ll make a stir,\r\n    Like a great astronomer.\r\n    Modest, yet withal an elf,\r\n    Bold, and lavish of thyself,\r\n    Since we needs must first have met\r\n      I have seen thee, high and low,\r\n    Thirty years or more, and yet\r\n      ’Twas a face I did not know:\r\n    Thou hast now, go where I may,\r\n    Fifty greetings in a day.\r\n    Ere a leaf is on the bush,\r\n    In the time before the thrush\r\n    Has a thought about its nest,\r\n      Thou wilt come with half a call,\r\n    Spreading out thy glossy breast\r\n      Like a careless prodigal;\r\n    Telling tales about the sun,\r\n    When there’s little warmth or none.\r\n\r\n    _Wordsworth._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShakspeare regarded the Violet as the emblem of constancy, as the\r\nfollowing occurs in one of his sonnets:--\r\n\r\n    Violet is for faithfulness,\r\n      Which in me shall abide;\r\n    Hoping, likewise, that from your heart\r\n      You will not let it slide.\r\n\r\n    _Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The Violet in her greenwood bower,\r\n      Where birchen boughs with hazles mingle,\r\n    May boast herself the fairest flower,\r\n      In glen, or copse, or forest dingle.\r\n\r\n    _Scott._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Under the hedge all safe and warm,\r\n    Sheltered from boisterous wind and storm,\r\n      We Violets lie:\r\n      With each small eye\r\n    Closely shut while the cold goes by.\r\n    You look at the bank, mid the biting frost,\r\n    And you sigh, and say that we’re dead and lost;\r\n      But, Lady stay\r\n      For a sunny day,\r\n    And you’ll find us again, alive and gay.\r\n    On mossy banks, under forest trees,\r\n    You’ll find us crowding, in days like these;\r\n      Purple and blue,\r\n      And white ones too,\r\n    Peep at the sun, and wait for you.\r\n    By maids and matrons, by old and young,\r\n    By rich and poor, our praise is sung;\r\n      And the blind man sighs\r\n      When his sightless eyes\r\n    He turns to the spot where our perfumes rise.\r\n    There is not a garden, the country through,\r\n    Where they plant not Violets, white and blue;\r\n      By princely hall,\r\n      And cottage small--\r\n    For we’re sought, and cherished, and culled by all.\r\n    Yet grand parterres and stiff trimmed beds\r\n    But ill become our modest heads;\r\n      We’d rather run,\r\n      In shadow and sun,\r\n    O’er the banks where our merry lives first begun.\r\n    There, where the Birken bough’s silvery shine\r\n    Gleams over the hawthorn and frail woodbine,\r\n      Moss, deep and green,\r\n      Lies thick, between\r\n    The plots where we Violet-flowers are seen.\r\n    And the small gay Celandine’s stars of gold\r\n    Rise sparkling beside our purple’s fold:--\r\n      Such a regal show\r\n      Is rare, I trow,\r\n    Save on the banks where Violets grow.\r\n\r\n    _Louisa A.

Fable informs us that the Daisy owes its origin to Belides, one\r\nof the Dryads, who were supposed to preside over meadows and pastures.\r\nWhile dancing on the turf with Ephigeus, whose suit she encouraged, she\r\nattracted the admiration of Vertumnus, the deity who presided over\r\norchards; and, to escape from him, she was transformed into the humble\r\nflower, the Latin name of which is Bellis. The ancient English name of\r\nthe flower was Day’s Eye, of which Daisy is a corruption. In Ossian’s\r\npoems, the Daisy is called the flower of the new-born--most expressive\r\nof innocence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    When smitten by the morning ray,\r\n    I see thee rise alert and gay,\r\n    Then, cheerful flower! my spirits play\r\n      With kindred gladness:\r\n    And when, at dark, by dews opprest,\r\n    Thou sink’st, the image of thy rest\r\n    Hath often eased my pensive breast\r\n      Of careful sadness.\r\n\r\n    _Wordsworth._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    She dwells amid the world’s dark ways,\r\n      Pure as in childhood’s hours;\r\n    And all her thoughts are poetry,\r\n      And all her words are flowers.\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. M.

Hewitt._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    ’Twas when the world was in its prime,\r\n      When meadows green and woodlands wild\r\n    Were strewn with flowers, in sweet spring-time,\r\n      And everywhere the Daisies smiled.\r\n    When undisturbed the ring-doves cooed,\r\n      While lovers sang each other’s praises,\r\n    As in embowered lanes they wooed,\r\n      Or on some bank white o’er with Daisies:\r\n    While Love went by with muffled feet,\r\n    Singing, “The Daisies they are sweet.”\r\n    Unfettered then he roamed abroad,\r\n      And as he willed it past the hours--\r\n    Now lingering idly by the road,\r\n      Now loitering by the wayside flowers;\r\n    For what cared he about the morrow?\r\n      Too young to sigh, too old to fear--\r\n    No time had he to think of sorrow,\r\n      Who found the Daisies everywhere;\r\n    Still sang he, through each green retreat,\r\n    “The Daisies they are very sweet.”\r\n    With many a maiden did he dally,\r\n      Like a glad brook that turns away--\r\n    Here in, there out, across the valley,\r\n      With every pebble stops to play;\r\n    Taking no note of space nor time,\r\n      Through flowers, the banks adorning,\r\n    Still rolling on, with silver chime,\r\n      In star-clad night and golden morning.\r\n    So went Love on, through cold and heat,\r\n    Singing, “The Daisy’s ever sweet.”\r\n    ’Twas then the flowers were haunted\r\n      With fairy forms and lovely things,\r\n    Whose beauty elder bards have chanted,\r\n      And how they lived in crystal springs,\r\n    And swang upon the honied bells;\r\n      In meadows danced round dark green mazes,\r\n    Strewed flowers around the holy wells,\r\n      But never trampled on the Daisies.\r\n    They spared the star that lit their feet,\r\n    The Daisy was so very sweet.\r\n\r\n    _Miller._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    When soothed awhile by milder airs,\r\n    Thee Winter in the garland wears\r\n    That thinly shades his few gray hairs;\r\n                Spring cannot shun thee;\r\n    Whole summer fields are thine by right,\r\n    And autumn, melancholy wight,\r\n    Doth in thy crimson head delight,\r\n                When rains are on thee.\r\n    In shoals and bands, a morrice train,\r\n    Thou greet’st the traveller in the lane;\r\n    If welcomed once thou count’st it gain,\r\n                Thou art not daunted;\r\n    Nor car’st if thou be set at naught:\r\n    And oft alone in nooks remote\r\n    We meet thee, like a pleasant thought,\r\n                When such are wanted.\r\n\r\n    _Wordsworth._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I cannot gaze on aught that wears\r\n      The beauty of the skies,\r\n    Or aught that in life’s valley bears\r\n      The hues of paradise;\r\n    I cannot look upon a star,\r\n    Or cloud that seems a seraph’s car,\r\n    Or any form of purity--\r\n    Unmingled with a dream of thee.\r\n\r\n    _P. Benjamin._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The Daisy scattered on each meade and downe,\r\n    A golden tuft within a silver crown;\r\n    Faire fell that dainty flower! and may there be\r\n    No shepherd graced that doth not honour thee.\r\n\r\n    _Browne._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    There is a flower, a little flower\r\n      With silver crest and golden eye,\r\n    That welcomes every changing hour,\r\n      And weathers every sky.\r\n\r\n    _Montgomery._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Heaven may awhile correct the virtuous,\r\n    Yet it will wipe their eyes again, and make\r\n    Their faces whiter with their tears. Innocence\r\n    Concealed is the stolen pleasure of the gods,\r\n    Which never ends in shame, as that of men\r\n    Doth oftentimes do; but like the sun breaks forth,\r\n    When it hath gratified another world;\r\n    And to our unexpecting eyes appears\r\n    More glorious through its late obscurity.\r\n\r\n    _John Fountain._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPERIWINKLE.... _Tender Recollections_.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn France, the Periwinkle has been adopted as the emblem of the\r\npleasures of memory and sincere friendship, probably in allusion to\r\nRousseau’s recollection of his friend, Madame de Warens, occasioned,\r\nafter a lapse of thirty years, by the sight of this flower, which they\r\ntogether had admired. This plant is deeply rooted in the soil which it\r\nadorns. It throws out its shoots on all sides to clasp the earth, and\r\ncovers it with flowers, which reflect the hue of heaven. Thus our first\r\naffections, warm, pure, and artless, seem to be of heavenly origin.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Though the rock of my last hope is shivered,\r\n      And its fragments are sunk in the wave,\r\n    Though I feel that my soul is delivered\r\n      To pain,--it shall not be its slave.\r\n    There is many a pang to pursue me:\r\n      They may crush, but they shall not contemn;\r\n    They may torture, but shall not subdue me,--\r\n      ’Tis of thee that I think, not of them.\r\n\r\n    _Byron._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    ’Tis sweet, and yet ’tis sad, that gentle power,\r\n    Which throws in winter’s lap the spring-tide flower:\r\n    I love to dream of days my childhood knew,\r\n    When, with the sister of my heart, time flew\r\n    On wings of innocence and hope! dear hours,\r\n    When joy sprang up about our path, like flowers!\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. A. M. Wells._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The lesser Periwinkle’s bloom,\r\n    Like carpet of Damascus’ loom,\r\n    Pranks with bright blue the tissue wove\r\n    Of verdant foliage: and above\r\n    With milk-white flowers, whence soon shall swell\r\n    Red fruitage, to the taste and smell\r\n    Pleasant alike, the Strawberry weaves\r\n    Its coronets of three-fold leaves\r\n    In mazes through the sloping wood.\r\n\r\n    _Mant._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Where captivates the sky-blue Periwinkle\r\n    Under the cottage eaves.\r\n\r\n    _Hurdis._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                      Remember thee?\r\n    Yea, from the table of my memory\r\n    I’ll wipe away all trivial fond records,\r\n    All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,\r\n    That youth and observation copied there;\r\n    And thy commandment all alone shall live\r\n    Within the book and volume of my brain,\r\n    Unmixed with baser matter.\r\n\r\n    _Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                  Oh! only those\r\n    Whose souls have felt this one idolatry\r\n    Can tell how precious is the slightest thing\r\n    Affection gives and hallows! A dead flower\r\n    Will long be kept, remembrancer of looks\r\n    That made each leaf a treasure.\r\n\r\n    _Miss Landon._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSWEET-BRIER, OR EGLANTINE.... _Poetry_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eglantine is the poet’s flower. In the floral games, it was the\r\nprize for the best composition on the charms of study and eloquence.\r\nThough its flowers are most beautiful in hue, their fragrance is their\r\nmore valuable quality. In like manner, the charms of poetry and\r\neloquence should be considered superior to those of appearance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    And well the poet, at her shrine,\r\n      May bend and worship while he woos;\r\n    To him she is a thing divine,\r\n    The inspiration of his line,\r\n      His loved one, and his muse.\r\n    If to his song the echo rings\r\n      Of fame--’tis woman’s voice he hears;\r\n    If ever from his lyre’s proud strings\r\n    Flow sounds, like rush of angel wings,\r\n    ’Tis that she listens, while he sings,\r\n      With blended smiles and tears.\r\n\r\n    _Halleck._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n          Give me the poet’s lyre!\r\n    And as the seraph in his orbit sings,\r\n    Oh, may I strike the heaven-attuned strings,\r\n          With a seraphic fire!\r\n    With music fill the mighty dome of mind,\r\n    And the rapt souls of men in music brightly bind!\r\n\r\n    _J. W. H._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                  Trace the young poet’s fate;\r\n    Fresh from his solitude, the child of dreams,\r\n    His heart upon his lips he seeks the world,\r\n    To find him fame and fortune, as if life\r\n    Were like a fairy tale. His song has led\r\n    The way before him; flatteries fill his ear,\r\n    His presence courted, and his words are caught;\r\n    And he seems happy in so many friends.\r\n    What marvel if he somewhat overrate\r\n    His talents and his state? These scenes soon change.\r\n    The vain, who sought to mix their name with his;\r\n    The curious, who but live for some new sight;\r\n    The idle--all these have been gratified,\r\n    And now neglect stings even more than scorn.\r\n\r\n    _Miss Landon._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLILAC.... _First Emotions of Love_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe freshness of the verdure of the Lilac; the flexibility of its\r\nbranches; the profusion of its flowers; their transitory beauty and\r\ntheir soft hues,--all remind us of those emotions which embellish\r\nbeauty, and throw such a light around our youthful hours. It is said\r\nthat Van Spaendonc himself threw down his pencil on viewing a group of\r\nLilacs. Nature seems to have delighted in creating its delicate\r\nclusters, which astonish by their beauty and variety. The fragrance of\r\nthe flowers is even more gratifying than their beauty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                        She had grown,\r\n    In her unstained seclusion, bright and pure\r\n    As a first opening Lilac, when it spreads\r\n    Its clear leaves to the sweetest dawn of May.\r\n\r\n    _Percival._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    When first thou earnest, gentle, shy, and fond,\r\n      My purest, first-born love, and dearest treasure,\r\n    My heart received thee with a joy beyond\r\n      All that it yet had felt of earthly pleasure;\r\n    Nor thought that any love again might be\r\n    So deep and strong, as that I felt for thee.\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. Norton._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I love thee,--and I live! The moon,\r\n      Who sees me from her calm above,\r\n    The wind, who weaves her dim, soft tune\r\n      About me, know how much I love!\r\n    Naught else, save night, and the lonely hour,\r\n      E’er heard my passion wild and strong;\r\n    Even _thou_ yet deem’st not of thy power,\r\n    Unless thou read’st aright my song!\r\n\r\n    _Barry Cornwall._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    She loves--but knows not whom she loves,\r\n      Nor what his race, nor whence he came;--\r\n    Like one who meets, in Indian groves,\r\n      Some beauteous bird without a name,\r\n    Brought by the last ambrosial breeze,\r\n    From isles in the undiscovered seas,\r\n    To show his plumage for a day\r\n    To wondering eyes, and wing away!\r\n\r\n    _Moore._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTULIP.... _Declaration of Love_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tulip is an extraordinary favourite in many parts of Europe and\r\nAsia; and, in Holland and Turkey, the most extravagant prices are paid\r\nfor fine specimens. On account of the elegance of its form, the beauty\r\nof its colours, and its want of fragrance and other useful qualities,\r\nthis flower has been considered as an appropriate symbol of a female who\r\npossesses no recommendation but a beautiful appearance. In the East, the\r\nTulip is employed as the emblem by which a lover makes known his passion\r\nto his mistress; as the Tulip expresses the idea that he has a face all\r\nfire and a heart all coal.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Not one of Flora’s brilliant race\r\n      A form more perfect can display:\r\n    Art could not feign more simple grace,\r\n      Nor Nature take a line away.\r\n    Yet, rich as morn, of many a hue,\r\n      When flushing clouds through darkness strike,\r\n    The Tulip’s petals shine in dew,\r\n      All beautiful, but none alike.\r\n\r\n    _Montgomery._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    My heart is sad and lonely,\r\n      With weariness I pine;\r\n    Would thou wert here, mine only,--\r\n      Would I were wholly thine!\r\n\r\n    _H.

The people of the East retain the same custom\r\nin the decoration of their cemeteries. The Turks plant the Cypress at\r\nthe head and at the foot of the graves. According to Ovid, the Cypress\r\nderived its name from Cyparissos, an especial friend of Apollo’s, who,\r\nin grief at having inadvertently killed a favourite stag of his, prayed\r\nthe gods that his mourning might be made perpetual, and was changed into\r\na Cypress tree, the branches of which were thenceforward used at\r\nfunerals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Lady dear! this history\r\n      Is thy fated lot,\r\n    Ever such thy watching\r\n      For what cometh not,\r\n    Till with anxious waiting dull,\r\n    Round thee fades the beautiful;\r\n    Still thou seekest on, though weary,\r\n      Seeking still in vain.\r\n\r\n    _Miss Landon._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Thou art lost to me for ever,--I have lost thee, Isadore,\r\n    Thy head will never rest upon my loyal bosom more.\r\n    Thy tender eyes will never more gaze fondly into mine,\r\n    Nor thine arms around me lovingly and trustingly entwine.\r\n    Thou art dead and gone, loving wife,--thy heart is still and cold,--\r\n    And I at one stride have become most comfortless and old;\r\n    Of our whole world of love and song, thou wast the only light,\r\n    A star, whose setting left behind, ah! me, how dark a night!\r\n            Thou art lost to me, for ever, Isadore.\r\n\r\n    _Albert Pike._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The Cypress is the emblem of mourning.\r\n\r\n    _Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Alas, for earthly joy, and hope, and love,\r\n      Thus stricken down, e’en in their holiest hour!\r\n    What deep, heart-wringing anguish must they prove,\r\n      Who live to weep the blasted tree or flower!\r\n    Oh, wo, deep wo to earthly love’s fond trust,\r\n    When all it once has worshipped lies in dust!\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. Embury._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALL-FLOWER.... _Fidelity in Adversity_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis flower derives its name from the circumstance of its growing upon\r\nold walls, the casements and battlements of ancient castles, and among\r\nthe ruins of abbeys. The troubadors were accustomed to wearing a bouquet\r\nof Wall-flowers, as the emblem of an affection which is proof against\r\ntime and the frowns of fortune.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      _Adah._--Alas! thou sinnest now, my Cain; thy words\r\n    Sound impious in mine ears.\r\n\r\n      _Cain._--Then leave me!\r\n\r\n      _Adah._--Never,\r\n    Though thy God left thee!\r\n\r\n    _Byron._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    An emblem true thou art\r\n      Of love’s enduring lustre given\r\n    To cheer a lonely heart.\r\n\r\n    _Barton._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Flower of the solitary place!\r\n      Gray Ruin’s golden crown,\r\n    That lendest melancholy grace\r\n      To haunts of old renown;\r\n    Thou mantlest o’er the battlements\r\n      By strife or storm decayed;\r\n    And fillest up each envious rent\r\n      Time’s canker-tooth hath made.\r\n\r\n    _Moir._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Though human, thou didst not deceive me;\r\n      Though woman, thou didst not forsake;\r\n    Though loved, thou forborest to grieve me;\r\n      Though slandered, thou never couldst shake;\r\n    Though trusted, thou didst not disclaim me;\r\n      Though parted, it was not to fly;\r\n    Though watchful, ’twas not to defame me;\r\n      Nor, mute, that the world might belie.\r\n\r\n    _Byron._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Yes, love! my breast, at sorrow’s call,\r\n      Shall tremble like thine own;\r\n    If from those eyes the tear-drops fall,\r\n      They shall not fall alone.\r\n    Our souls, like heaven’s aerial bow,\r\n    Blend every light within their glow,\r\n      Of joy or sorrow known;\r\n    And grief, divided with thy heart,\r\n    Were sweeter far than joy apart.\r\n\r\n    _Anon._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAWTHORN.... _Hope_.\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious significations have been given to the Hawthorn. Among the Turks,\r\na branch of it expresses the wish of a lover to receive a kiss from the\r\nobject of his affection. Among the ancient Greeks, the Hawthorn was a\r\nsymbol of conjugal union; its blossomed boughs were carried about at\r\ntheir wedding festivities, and the newly-married couple were even\r\nlighted to their bridal chamber with torches made of its wood. In\r\nEngland, the Hawthorn is used in the sports of May-days, and is,\r\ntherefore, frequently called May. There is a proverb among the rural\r\ninhabitants of that country, that a “store of haws portend cold\r\nwinters.” Though the Hawthorn is quoted as the emblem of Hope, it must\r\nbe considered more particularly as the lover’s hope.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    HOW MAY WAS FIRST MADE.\r\n\r\n    As Spring upon a silver cloud\r\n      Lay looking on the world below,\r\n    Watching the breezes as they bowed\r\n      The buds and blossoms to and fro,\r\n    She saw the fields with Hawthorns walled:\r\n      Said Spring, “New buds I will create.”\r\n    She to a Flower-Spirit called,\r\n      Who on the month of May did wait,\r\n    And bade her fetch a Hawthorn-spray,\r\n    That she might make the buds of May.\r\n    Said Spring, “The grass looks green and bright,\r\n      The Hawthorn-hedges too are green,\r\n    I’ll sprinkle them with flowers of light,\r\n      Such stars as earth has never seen;\r\n    And all through England’s girded vales,\r\n      Her steep hill-sides and haunted streams,\r\n    Where woodlands dip into the dales,\r\n      Where’er the Hawthorn stands and dreams,\r\n    Where thick-leaved trees make dark the day,\r\n    I’ll light each nook with flowers of May.\r\n    Like pearly dew-drops, white and round,\r\n      The shut-up buds shall first appear.\r\n    And in them be such fragrance found,\r\n      As breeze before did never bear;\r\n    Such as in Eden only dwelt,\r\n      When angels hovered round its bowers,\r\n    And long-haired Eve at morning knelt\r\n      In innocence amid the flowers:\r\n    While the whole air was, every way,\r\n    Filled with a perfume sweet as May.\r\n    And oft shall groups of children come,\r\n      Threading their way through shady places,\r\n    From many a peaceful English home,\r\n      The sunshine falling on their faces;\r\n    Starting with merry voice the thrush,\r\n      As through green lanes they wander singing,\r\n    To gather the sweet Hawthorn bush;\r\n      Which, homeward in the evening bringing\r\n    With smiling faces, they shall say,\r\n    ‘There’s nothing half so sweet as May.’\r\n    And many a poet yet unborn\r\n      Shall link its name with some sweet lay,\r\n    And lovers oft at early morn\r\n      Shall gather blossoms of the May;\r\n    With eyes bright as the silver dews,\r\n      Which on the rounded May-buds sleep,\r\n    And lips, whose parted smiles diffuse\r\n      A sunshine o’er the watch they keep,\r\n    Shall open all their white array\r\n    Of pearls, ranged like the buds of May.”\r\n    Spring shook the cloud on which she lay,\r\n    And silvered o’er the Hawthorn spray,\r\n    Then showered down the buds of May.\r\n\r\n    _Miller._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    With hope all pleases, nothing comes amiss.\r\n\r\n    _Rogers._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    And Hawthorn’s early blooms appear,\r\n    Like youthful hope upon life’s year.\r\n\r\n    _Drayton._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Gay was the love of paradise he drew\r\n    And pictured in his fancy; he did dwell\r\n    Upon it till it had a life; he threw\r\n    A tint of heaven athwart it--who can tell\r\n    The yearnings of his heart, the charm, the spell,\r\n    That bound him to that vision?\r\n\r\n    _Percival._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOVE-LIES-BLEEDING.... _Deserted Love_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis beautiful emblem of love, wounded and bereaved by fate, is a\r\nspecies of Amaranthus. The flower is of a reddish-purple hue, which\r\ncircumstance suggests its name.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    A single rose is shedding\r\n      Its lovely lustre meek and pale:\r\n    It looks as planted by despair--\r\n      So white, so faint--the slightest gale\r\n    Might whirl the leaves on high.\r\n\r\n    _Byron._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    And on with many a step of pain,\r\n      Our weary race is sadly run;\r\n    And still, as on we plod our way,\r\n      We find, as life’s gay dreams depart,\r\n    To close our being’s troubled day,\r\n      Naught left us but a broken heart.\r\n\r\n    _Percival._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Nor would I change my buried love\r\n    For any heart of living mould,\r\n    No--for I am a hero’s child--\r\n    I’ll hunt my quarry in the wild;\r\n    And still my home this mansion make,\r\n    Of all unheeded and unheeding,\r\n    And cherish, for my warrior’s sake,\r\n    The flower of Love-lies-bleeding.\r\n\r\n    _Campbell._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Upon her face there was the tint of grief,\r\n    The settled shadow of an inward strife,\r\n    And an unquiet drooping of the eye,\r\n    As if its lid were charged with unshed tears.\r\n\r\n    _Byron._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMYRTLE.... _Love_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Myrtle has ever been consecrated to Venus. At Rome, the temple of\r\nthe goddess was surrounded by a grove of Myrtles; and in Greece, she was\r\nadorned under the name of Myrtilla. It was observed by the ancients,\r\nthat, wherever the Myrtle grew, it excluded all other plants. So love,\r\nwherever it is permitted to grow, excludes all other feelings. The\r\nladies of modern Rome retain a strong affection for this plant,\r\npreferring its odour to that of the most fragrant essences.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Our love came as the early dew\r\n      Comes unto drooping flowers;\r\n    Dropping its first sweet freshness on\r\n      Our life’s dull, lonely hours.\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. R.

It adds an indescribable\r\ncharm to the spots where it blooms. Its snowy hues and general delicacy\r\nof appearance excite emotions of a kindred nature to those we experience\r\nin the company of one whose heart is free from guile, and whose manners\r\nare gentle and unpretending.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Lilacs then, and daffodillies,\r\n    And the nice-leaved, lesser Lilies,\r\n    Shading, like detected light,\r\n    Their little green-tipt lamps of white.\r\n\r\n    _Hunt._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I had found out a sweet green spot,\r\n      Where a Lily was blooming fair;\r\n    The din of the city disturbed it not,\r\n    But the spirit that shades the quiet cot\r\n      With its wings of love was there.\r\n    I found that Lily’s bloom,\r\n      When the day was dark and chill;\r\n    It smiled like a star in a misty gloom,\r\n    And it sent abroad a soft perfume,\r\n      Which is floating around me still.\r\n\r\n    _Percival._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The Lily, in whose snow-white bells\r\n    Simplicity delights and dwells.\r\n\r\n    _Balfour._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHYACINTH.... _Constancy_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe blue Hyacinth is mentioned by several English writers as the emblem\r\nof constancy. There are many varieties found in Europe and America, but\r\nthe variety known in Scotland as the “Blue Bell” is the most common and\r\nthe most celebrated.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    When daisies blush, and wind-flowers wet with dew,\r\n    When shady lanes with Hyacinth’s are blue,\r\n    When the elm blossoms o’er the brooding bird,\r\n    And, wild and wide, the plover’s wail is heard,\r\n    Where melts the mist on mountains far away,\r\n    Till morn is kindled into brightest day.\r\n\r\n    _Elliott._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Then come the wild weather, come sleet, or come snow,\r\n    We will stand by each other however it blow.\r\n    Oppression and sickness, and sorrow, and pain,\r\n    Shall be to our true love as links to the chain.\r\n\r\n    _Longfellow._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n        She loves him yet!\r\n    The flower the false one gave her\r\n      When last he came,\r\n    Is still with her wild tears wet.\r\n        She’ll ne’er forget,\r\n    Howe’er his faith may waver,\r\n      Through grief and shame,\r\n    Believe it,--she loves him yet!\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. Osgood._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Over the moorland, over the lea,\r\n    Dancing airily, there are we:\r\n    Sometimes, mounted on stems aloft,\r\n      We wave o’er broom and heather,\r\n    To meet the kiss of the zephyr soft;\r\n      Sometimes, close together,\r\n    Tired of dancing, tired of peeping,\r\n    Under the whin you’ll find us sleeping.\r\n    Daintily bend we our honied bells,\r\n    While the gossipping bee her story tells,\r\n    And drowsily hums and murmurs on\r\n    Of the wealth to her waxen storehouse gone;\r\n    And though she gathers our sweets the while,\r\n    We welcome her in with a nod and a smile.\r\n    No rock is too high--no vale too low,\r\n    For our fragile and tremulous forms to grow.\r\n                Sometimes we crown\r\n    The castle’s dizziest tower, and look\r\n                Laughingly down\r\n    On the pigmy men in the world below,\r\n          Wearily wandering to and fro.\r\n    Sometimes we dwell on the cragged crest\r\n                Of mountain high,\r\n    And the ruddy sun, from the blue sea’s breast,\r\n                Climbing the sky,\r\n    Looks from his couch of glory up,\r\n    And lights the dew in the bluebell’s cup.\r\n    We are crowning the mountain\r\n                With azure bells,\r\n          Or decking the fountains\r\n                In forest dells,\r\n    Or wreathing the ruin with clusters gray,\r\n        And nodding and laughing the livelong day;\r\n        Then chiming our lullaby, tired with play.\r\n        Are we not beautiful?

Another\r\nis so very like a fly, that it is named the Fly Orchis; another is like\r\na lizard, or some strange reptile, and the flowers being yellow, green,\r\nand purple, and twisted in and about one another in a very odd way, it\r\nreally looks like some horrible group of queer living creatures. One,\r\nfrom being fancied like a man, is called Man Orchis; another, very gayly\r\nspotted, and ornamented with a helmet-like appendage, is the Military\r\nOrchis; another is called Bee Orchis. Bishop Mant thus alludes to some\r\nof these:\r\n\r\n    Well boots it the thick-mantled leas\r\n    To traverse: if boon nature grant,\r\n    To crop the insect-seeming plant,\r\n    The vegetable Bee; or nigh\r\n    Of kin, the long-horned Butterfly,\r\n    White, or his brother purple pale,\r\n    Scenting alike the evening gale;\r\n    The Satyr flower, the pride of Kent,\r\n    Of Lizard form, and goat-like scent.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    No wonder that cheek in its beauty transcendent,\r\n      Excelleth the beauty of others by far;\r\n    No wonder that eye is so richly resplendent,\r\n      For your heart is a rose and your soul is a star.\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. Osgood._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    What right have you, madam, gazing in your shining mirror daily,\r\n    Getting so by heart your beauty, which all others must adore;\r\n    While you draw the golden ringlets down your fingers, to vow gayly,\r\n    You will wed no man that’s only good to God,--and nothing more.\r\n\r\n    _Miss Barrett._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOX.... _Stoicism_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe common Box, of which our hedge is formed, is indigenous in England,\r\npreferring the chalky hills of Surrey and Kent for its residence, but\r\nflourishing well on other soils. It is one of the most useful evergreen\r\nshrubs we possess, and especially as it will grow under the drip and\r\nshadow of other trees, as you know is the case with our hedge. It is\r\nfound in most European countries, from Britain southwards, also about\r\nMount Caucasus, Persia, China, Cochin China, and America. It was\r\nformerly much more common in England than now, having disappeared under\r\nthe spread of agriculture. Box-hill, in Surrey, is named from this tree,\r\nand is a conical elevation covered with a wood of Box-trees, some of\r\nlarge size. Boxley in Kent, and Boxwell in Gloucestershire, are also\r\nnamed from it. The leaf and general appearance of the tree are too\r\nfamiliar to require any description. The scent of the spring blossoms is\r\nrather powerful, and to some persons unpleasant. The timber is very\r\nvaluable, it is sold by weight, and, being very hard and smooth, and not\r\napt to warp, is well adapted for many nice and delicate purposes. In the\r\ndays of good old Evelyn, it appears to have been as much used as at\r\npresent, for he says, “It is good for the turner, engraver, carver,\r\nmathematical instrument maker, comb and pipe, or flute-maker, and the\r\nroots for the inlayer and cabinet-maker. Of box are made wheels,\r\nsheaves, pins, pegs for musical instruments, nut-crackers,\r\nbutton-moulds, weavers’ shuttles, hollar-sticks, bump-sticks, and\r\ndressers for the shoemaker, rulers, rolling-pins, pestles, mall-balls,\r\nbeetles, tops, chessmen, tables, screws, bobbins for bone-lace, spoons,\r\nknife-handles, but especially combs.” Most of those engravings in books,\r\ncalled wood-cuts, are done upon Box wood, and for that purpose English\r\nBox is superior to any other, though a great portion of what is used in\r\nthis country comes from the Levant. The ancients used combs made of\r\nBox-wood, and also instruments to be played on with the mouth. The\r\nRomans used to adorn their gardens with it, clipped into form, as we\r\nfind from mention being made of clipped Box-trees by their writers. It\r\nwas formerly much cut in this manner here, and was ranked next to the\r\nYew for its capabilities of taking artificial and grotesque forms; but\r\nexcept a few ancient hedges of Box, like our own, and those at Castle\r\nBromwich Hall, where the Yew hedges are also preserved, there are not\r\nmany vestiges of its former garden-glory remaining. A dwarf kind is used\r\nfor making a neat and firm edging to flower borders, for which nothing\r\nanswers so well, or produces so proper an effect.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Though youth be past, and beauty fled,\r\n      The constant heart its pledge redeems,\r\n    Like Box, that guards the flowerless bed,\r\n      And brighter from the contrast seems.\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. Hale._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNARCISSUS AND DAFFODIL.... _Self-Love_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are several species of the Narcissus. The Yellow Narcissus is\r\nbetter known as the Daffodil, and bears much resemblance to the Yellow\r\nLily. The Poetic Narcissus is the largest of the species, and may be\r\ndistinguished by the crimson border of the very shallow and almost flat\r\ncup of the nectary. Shakspeare, in his Winter’s Tale, speaks of\r\n\r\n                                Daffodils,\r\n    That come before the swallow dares, and taste\r\n    The winds of March with beauty.\r\n\r\nThe ancients attributed the origin of the Narcissus to the metamorphosis\r\nof a beautiful youth of that name, who, having slighted the love of the\r\nnymph Echo, became enamoured of his own image, which he beheld in a\r\nfountain, and pined to death in consequence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I wandered lonely, as a cloud\r\n      That floats on high o’er vales and hills\r\n    When all at once I saw a crowd,\r\n      A host of golden Daffodils;\r\n    Beside the lake, beneath the trees,\r\n    Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.\r\n    Continuous as the stars that shine\r\n      And twinkle on the milky way,\r\n    They stretched in never-ending line\r\n      Along the margin of the bay;\r\n    Ten thousand saw I at a glance,\r\n    Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.\r\n\r\n    The waves beside them danced, but they\r\n      Outdid the sparkling waves in glee;\r\n    A poet could not but be gay\r\n      In such a joyful company:\r\n    I gazed--and gazed--but little thought\r\n    What wealth to me the show had brought.\r\n    For oft when on my couch I lie,\r\n      In vacant or in pensive mood,\r\n    They flash upon that inward eye\r\n      Which is the bliss of solitude.\r\n    And then my heart with pleasure fills,\r\n    And dances with the Daffodils.\r\n\r\n    _Wordsworth._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Nature’s laws must be obeyed,\r\n    And this is one she strictly laid\r\n    On every soul which she has made,\r\n      Down from our earliest mother:\r\n    Be _self_ your first and greatest care,\r\n    From all reproach the darling spare,\r\n    And any blame that she should bear,\r\n      Put off upon another.\r\n\r\n    _Miss Gould._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                        The pale Narcissus\r\n    Still feeds upon itself; but, newly blown,\r\n    The nymphs will pluck it from its tender stalk,\r\n    And say, “Go, fool, and to thy image talk.”\r\n\r\n    _Lord Thurlow._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLILY.... _Majesty_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lily’s height and beauty speak command. The Jews imitated its form\r\nin the decorations of their first magnificent temple; and Christ\r\ndescribed it as more splendid than King Solomon in his most gorgeous\r\napparel. According to ancient mythology, there was originally but one\r\nspecies of Lily, and that was orange-coloured; and the white was\r\nproduced by the following circumstance:--Jupiter, wishing to render\r\nHercules immortal, prevailed on Juno to take a deep draught of nectar,\r\nwhich threw the queen into a profound sleep. Jupiter then placed the\r\ninfant Hercules at her breast, so that the divine milk might ensure\r\nimmortality.

It is\r\ndistinguished by many singular properties. It blossoms the whole year,\r\nand on that account, the Romans termed it the flower of the calends, or\r\nof all the months. Its flowers are open only from nine in the morning\r\ntill three in the afternoon. They always follow the course of the sun,\r\nby turning from east to west as he proceeds upon his daily journey. In\r\nJuly and August these flowers emit, during the night, small luminous\r\nsparks. Alone, the Marigold expresses grief; interwoven with other\r\nflowers, the varied events of life; the cloud and sunshine of ill and\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    And see the flaunting Marigold,\r\n    Gay from its marshy bed unfold\r\n    Mid minor lights its disks that shine\r\n    Like suns for brightness.\r\n\r\n    _Anon._\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Open afresh your round of starry folds,\r\n    Ye ardent Marigolds!\r\n    Dry up the moisture of your golden lids.\r\n\r\n    _Keats._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    When, with a serious musing, I behold\r\n    The grateful and obsequious Marigold,\r\n    How duly, every morning, she displays\r\n    Her open breast when Phœbus spreads his rays;\r\n    How she observes him in his daily walk\r\n    Still bending towards him her small slender stalk;\r\n    How, when he down declines, she droops and mourns,\r\n    Bedewed as ’twere with tears till he returns.\r\n\r\n    _Withers._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I need not say how, one by one,\r\n      Love’s flowers have dropped from off love’s chain,\r\n    Enough to say that they are gone,\r\n      And that they cannot bloom again.\r\n\r\n    _Miss Landon._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    We sometimes see a shadow swiftly skim\r\n      In summer o’er the hills and vales of earth:\r\n      So transient shades steal o’er the face of mirth,\r\n    And frequent tears the brightest eyes bedim.\r\n\r\n    _MacKellar._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Thine is a grief that wastes the heart,\r\n      Like mildew on a tulip’s dyes--\r\n    When hope, deferred but to depart,\r\n      Loses its smiles but keeps its sighs.\r\n\r\n    _Miss Landon._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHITE ROSE.... _I would be single_.\r\n\r\n    How uneasy is his life\r\n    Who is troubled with a wife!\r\n    Be she ne’er so fair or comely,\r\n    Be she foul or be she homely,\r\n    Be she blithe or melancholy,\r\n    Have she wit, or have she folly,\r\n    Be she prudent, be she squandering,\r\n    Be she staid, or be she wandering,\r\n    Yet uneasy is his life\r\n    Who is married to a wife.\r\n\r\n    _Cotton._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe White Rose became celebrated in English history as the badge of the\r\nhouse of York, in the War of the Roses. Among the ancients, who\r\nconsidered the Rose as the queen of flowers, it was the custom to crown\r\nnew-married persons with a chaplet of Red and White Roses; and in the\r\nprocession of the Corybantes, the goddess Cybele, the protectress of\r\ncities, was pelted with White Roses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    A single Rose is shedding\r\n    Its lovely lustre meek and pale:\r\n    It looks as planted by despair--\r\n    So white, so faint--the slightest gale\r\n    Might whirl the leaves on high.\r\n\r\n    _Byron._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYELLOW ROSE.... _Jealousy_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPfeffel, a German poet, has pleasingly accounted for the origin of the\r\nYellow Rose, the emblem of envy and jealousy, in the following manner:\r\n\r\n    Once a White Rose-bud reared her head,\r\n    And peevishly to Flora said,\r\n    “Look at my sister’s blushing hue--\r\n    Pray, mother, let me have it too.”\r\n    “Nay, child,” was Flora’s mild reply,\r\n    “Be thankful for such gifts as I\r\n    Have deemed befitting to dispense--\r\n    Thy dower the hue of innocence.”\r\n    When did Persuasion’s voice impart\r\n    Content and peace to female heart\r\n    Where baleful Jealousy bears sway,\r\n    And scares each gentler guest away?\r\n    The Rose still grumbled and complained,\r\n    Her mother’s bounties still disdained.\r\n    “Well, then,” said angered Flora--“take”--\r\n    She breathed upon her as she spake--\r\n    “Henceforth no more in simple vest\r\n    Of innocence shalt thou be drest--\r\n    Take that which better suits thy mind,\r\n    The hue for Jealousy designed!”\r\n    The Yellow Rose has from that hour\r\n    Borne evidence of Envy’s power.\r\n\r\n                            Is whispering nothing?\r\n    Is leaning cheek to cheek?--is meeting noses?\r\n    Kissing with inside lip?--stopping the career\r\n    Of laughter with a sigh?--(a note infallible\r\n    Of breaking honesty:)--horsing foot to foot?--\r\n    Skulking in corners?--wishing clocks more swift?--\r\n    Hours, minutes?--noon, midnight? and all eyes\r\n    Blind with the pin and web, but theirs,--theirs only,\r\n    That would unseen be wicked?--is this nothing?\r\n    Why, then the world, and all that’s in it, is nothing.\r\n\r\n    _Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Thou wondrous yellow fiend!\r\n    Temper an antidote with antimony,\r\n    And ’tis infectious: Mix jealousy with marriage,\r\n    It poisons virtue.\r\n\r\n    _Davenport._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    O jealousy! thou bane of pleasing friendship,\r\n    Thou worst invader of our tender bosoms;\r\n    How does thy rancour poison all our softness,\r\n    And turn our gentle natures into bitterness!\r\n\r\n    _Rowe._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Ah! poor unconscious rival maid,\r\n    How drearily must thou sicken and fade,\r\n    ’Neath jealousy’s dark Upas shade!\r\n\r\n    _Tupper._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRED ROSE.... _Beauty and Love_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAccording to ancient fable, the red colour of the Rose may be traced to\r\nVenus, whose delicate foot, when she was hastening to the relief of her\r\nbeloved Adonis, was pierced by a thorn that drew blood,\r\n\r\n    Which on the White Rose being shed,\r\n    Made it for ever after red.\r\n\r\n    _Herrick._\r\n\r\nMiller, the “basket-maker” and poet, gives the following beautiful\r\naccount of the origin of the Red Rose:--\r\n\r\n     It was drawing toward the decline of a beautiful summer day, when\r\n     the red, round sun was bending down a deep, blue, unclouded sky, to\r\n     where a vast range of mountains stretched, summit upon summit, and\r\n     in the far distance again rose, pile upon pile, until high over all\r\n     towered the god-haunted height of cloud-capt Olympus, rising with\r\n     its rounded shoulder, like another world, on the uttermost rim of\r\n     the horizon. At the foot of this immense world of untrodden\r\n     mountains, opened out a wide, immeasurable forest, stretching far\r\n     away, league upon league, with its unexplored ocean of trees, which\r\n     were bounded somewhere by another range of unknown mountains, that\r\n     again overlooked a vast, silent, and unpeopled world. On the edge\r\n     of this pathless desert of trees, and nearest the foot of Olympus,\r\n     sat the Queen of Beauty and of Love; with her golden tresses\r\n     unbound, and her matchless countenance buried within the palms of\r\n     her milk-white hands, and sobbing as if her fond, immortal heart\r\n     would break. Beside her was laid the dead body of Adonis, his face\r\n     half-hidden beneath the floating fall of her hair, as she bent over\r\n     him and wept. Beyond them lay the stiffened bulk of the grim and\r\n     grisly boar, his hideous jaws flecked with blood and foam, and his\r\n     terrible tusks glittering like the heads of pointed spears, as they\r\n     stood out, sharp and white, in the unclouded sunset. Not an\r\n     immortal comforter was by: for the far-seeing eye of Jove was fixed\r\n     listlessly upon the golden nectar-cup, as it passed from hand to\r\n     hand, along the rounded circle of the gods, while they were\r\n     recounting the deeds of other days, when they waged war against the\r\n     Titans. Even the chariot of Venus stood unyoked at the foot of the\r\n     mount; the silken traces lay loosely thrown together upon the\r\n     ground, and the white doves were idly hovering round in the air;\r\n     for the weeping goddess was so overwhelmed with sorrow, that she\r\n     had forgotten to waft her light-winged whisper to the Mount of\r\n     Olympus; nor had they received any summons from the charioteer\r\n     Love, who lay sleeping upon a bed of Roses, with his bow and arrows\r\n     by his side.\r\n\r\n     In the glade of this vast forest of the old primeval world, whose\r\n     echoes had never been startled by the blows of a descending axe,\r\n     nor a branch rent from their majestic boles, saving by the dreaded\r\n     bolts of the Thunderer, or some earth-shaking storm, which, in his\r\n     anger, he had blown abroad, the Goddess of Beauty still continued\r\n     to sit, as if unconscious of the savage solitude which surrounded\r\n     her; nor did she notice the back-kneed Satyrs, that peered upon her\r\n     unrobed loveliness with burning eyes, from many a shadowy recess in\r\n     the thick-leaved underwood. Upon the trunks of the mighty and\r\n     storm-tortured trees, the sunset here and there flashed down in\r\n     rays of molten gold, making their gnarled and twisted stems look as\r\n     if they had just issued red-hot from the jaws of some cavern-like\r\n     furnace, whose glare the fancy might still trace in a blackened\r\n     avenue of trees, up which the red ranks of the consuming lightning\r\n     had ages agone marched. Every way, where the lengthened shadows of\r\n     evening began to fall in deeper masses, the forest assumed a more\r\n     savage look, which was heightened by the noise of some\r\n     deadly-tusked boar, as he went snorting and thundering through the\r\n     thicket; the growl of the tiger was also heard at intervals, as he\r\n     retreated farther into the deepening darkness of the dingles,\r\n     mistaking the blazing sunset for some devouring fire. But the eyes\r\n     of Venus saw only the pale face of her lover,--she felt only his\r\n     chilly and stiffened hand sink colder and deeper into the warm\r\n     heart on which she pressed it, and over which her tears fell,\r\n     slower or faster, just as the mournful gusts of her sorrow arose or\r\n     subsided, and sent the blinding rain from the blue-veined lids that\r\n     overhung her clouded eyes; for never had her immortal heart before\r\n     been swollen by such an overflowing torrent of grief. But the\r\n     warmth of her kisses, which would almost have awakened life in a\r\n     statue of marble, fell upon lips now cold as a wintry grave; and\r\n     her sighs, which came sweeter than the morning air when it first\r\n     arises from its sleep among the Roses, stirred not one of the\r\n     clotted ringlets which softened into the yielding whiteness of her\r\n     heavenly bosom,--\r\n\r\n    “She looked upon his lips, and they are pale;\r\n      She took him by the hand, and that was cold;\r\n    She whispered in his ear a heavy tale,\r\n      As if they heard the woful words she told.”\r\n\r\n     She would have given her immortality but to have heard those lips\r\n     murmur and complain, as they had done a few hours before--to have\r\n     seen those eyes again burning with disdain, as they flashed back\r\n     indignantly the warm advances of her love. She pictured him as he\r\n     had that very morning stood, in all the pride of youthful manliness\r\n     and beauty, when he looked down, blushing and abashed, as he held\r\n     his boar-spear in his hand, when she threw the studded bridle over\r\n     her own rounded and naked arm, and the proud courser pricked up his\r\n     ears with delight, and shook his braided mane, while his long tail\r\n     streamed out like a banner, and his proud eye dilated, and his\r\n     broad nostrils expanded, as he went trampling haughtily on, proud\r\n     to be led by the Queen of Beauty and of Love. She pictured the\r\n     Primrose bank on which he lay twined reluctantly in her arms, how\r\n     he tried to conceal his face, this way, and that way, among the\r\n     flowers, whenever she attempted to press his lips,--\r\n\r\n    “While on each cheek appeared a pretty dimple:\r\n      Love made those hollows, if himself were slain,\r\n    He might be buried in a tomb so simple.”\r\n     She recalled his attitude as he untwined himself from her embrace,\r\n     and hurried off in pursuit of his steed, which had snapped the rein\r\n     that secured it to the branch of a neighbouring oak, and started at\r\n     full speed down one of the wild avenues of the forest. In fancy she\r\n     again saw him, as he sat panting upon the ground, weary with the\r\n     fruitless pursuit; and how, kneeling down, she then\r\n\r\n                “Took him gently by the hand,\r\n    A lily prisoned in a jail of snow,\r\n      Or ivory in an alabaster band:\r\n    So white a friend engirt so white a foe;\r\n      A beauteous combat, wilful and unwilling,\r\n      Showed like two silver doves that sat a-billing.”\r\n\r\n     And as she looked upon him, she imagined that his lips moved again,\r\n     as when they said, “Give me my hand, why dost thou feel it?” she\r\n     fancied she again felt his face upon her cheek--his kisses upon her\r\n     lips, as when she fell down and feigned herself dead; the while he\r\n     bent her fingers, and felt her pulse, and endeavoured by a hundred\r\n     endearments and tender expressions, to restore her. And how, when\r\n     she pretended to recover, she paid him back again with unnumbered\r\n     kisses, whilst he, wearied with opposing her, no longer offered any\r\n     resistance; and how, at last, he broke from her fair arms, and,\r\n     darting down the “dark lawn,” left her seated alone upon the\r\n     ground.\r\n\r\n     As picture after picture rose before her of what had been, and\r\n     every close pressure of the cold, inanimate, but still dearly-loved\r\n     form, told her what the hand of death had done, and that those\r\n     very “hopes and fears which are akin to love” were now for ever\r\n     darkened and extinguished; she burst forth into such a loud,\r\n     wailing lamentation, that the sound found its way unto Olympus, and\r\n     fell upon the ever-open ear of Jove, who, in a moment, dashed the\r\n     golden nectar-cup upon the ground, which he was about uplifting to\r\n     his lips, and sprang upon his feet. There was a sound of hurrying\r\n     to and fro over the mountain-summits, which sloped down to the edge\r\n     of the forest--of gods and goddesses passing through the air--of\r\n     golden chariots, that went whistling along like the wind, as they\r\n     cleft their rapid way--and the flapping of dark, immortal wings,\r\n     between which many a beautiful divinity was seated. The golden\r\n     clouds of sunset gathered red and ominously about the rounded\r\n     summit of Olympus, and a blood-red light glared upon such parts of\r\n     the forest as were not darkened by the deepening shadows of the\r\n     approaching twilight,--for the Thunderer had stamped his immortal\r\n     foot, and jarred the mighty mountain to its very base. And now, in\r\n     that forest glade, which but a few moments before was so wild and\r\n     desolate,--where only the forms of the grisly boar, the dead\r\n     Adonis, and the weeping Goddess of Beauty broke the level lines of\r\n     the angry sunset, were assembled the stern Gods, and the weeping\r\n     Graces, and the fluttering Loves that ever hover around the chariot\r\n     of Venus. With bleeding feet and drooping head,--wan, and cold, and\r\n     speechless,--was the Goddess of Beauty lifted into her golden\r\n     chariot, and, with the dead body of Adonis, wafted by her silver\r\n     and silent-winged doves to Mount Olympus. And then a deep darkness\r\n     settled down upon the forest. When the next morning’s sun arose\r\n     and gilded those silent glades, the Roses, on which the blood of\r\n     the Goddess of Beauty had fallen, and which were ever before white,\r\n     were changed into a delicate crimson; and wherever a tear had\r\n     fallen, there had sprung up a flower which the earth had never\r\n     before borne, and that was the Lily of the Valley; and wherever a\r\n     ruddy drop had fallen from the death-wound of Adonis sprang up the\r\n     red flower which still beareth his name. Even the white\r\n     apple-blossoms, which he clutched in his agony, ever after wore the\r\n     ruddy stain which they caught from his folded fingers; and the\r\n     drowsy Poppy grew up everywhere around the spot, as if to denote\r\n     that the only consolation which can be found for sorrow is the\r\n     long, unbroken sleep of death. Thus the Rose, which was before\r\n     white, became red, and was ever after dedicated to Beauty and Love.\r\n\r\nIts beautiful tint is traced to another source by a modern poet:\r\n\r\n    As erst in Eden’s blissful bowers,\r\n    Young Eve surveyed her countless flowers,\r\n    An opening Rose of purest white\r\n    She marked with eye that beamed delight,\r\n    Its leaves she kissed, and straight it drew\r\n    From beauty’s lip the vermeil hue.\r\n\r\n    _Carey._\r\n\r\nThe poets have not exaggerated the beauty of the red-hued Rose. She\r\nwould be crowned Queen of the Flowers by the most unpoetical. The\r\nemblem of all ages, the interpreter of all our feelings, the Rose\r\nmingles with our festivities, our joys, and our griefs. Its fragrance is\r\nas delightful as its hues; and no truer emblem of love and beauty could\r\nhave been chosen.\r\n\r\n                            I have cherished\r\n    A love for one whose beauty would have charmed\r\n    In Athens. And I know what ’tis to love\r\n    A spiritual beauty, and behind the foil\r\n    Of an unblemished loveliness, still find\r\n    Charms of a higher order, and a power\r\n    Deeper and more resistless. Had I found\r\n    Such thoughts and feelings, such a clear deep stream\r\n    Of mind in one whom vulgar men had thrown\r\n    As a dull pebble from them, I had loved\r\n    Not with a love less fond, nor with a flame\r\n    Of less devotion.\r\n\r\n    _Percival._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                  There’s no miniature\r\n    In her face, but is a copious theme,\r\n    Which would, discoursed at large of, make a volume.\r\n    What clear arched brows! what sparkling eyes! the lilies\r\n    Contending with the roses in her cheeks,\r\n    Who shall most set them off. What ruby lips!--\r\n    Or unto what can I compare her neck,\r\n    But to a rock of crystal? Every limb\r\n    Proportioned to love’s wish, and in their neatness\r\n    Add lustre to the richness of her habit,\r\n    Not borrowed from it.\r\n\r\n    _Massinger._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPEONY.... _Anger_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Peony is chosen as the emblem of Anger from its red and fiery hues.\r\nIt is a large double flower, and presents a superb appearance; but is\r\nalmost destitute of scent.\r\n\r\n    I am burned up with inflaming wrath;\r\n    A rage, whose heat hath this condition,\r\n    That nothing can allay, nothing but blood,\r\n    The blood, and dearest valued blood, of France.\r\n\r\n    _Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The wildest ills that darken life\r\n    Are rapture to the bosom’s strife;\r\n    The tempest, in its blackest form,\r\n    Is beauty to the bosom’s storm;\r\n    The ocean, lashed to fury loud,\r\n    Its high wave mingling with the cloud,\r\n    Is peaceful, sweet serenity,\r\n    To anger’s dark and stormy sea.\r\n\r\n    _J. W. Eastburne._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Oh, that my tongue were in the thunder’s mouth!\r\n    Then with a passion would I shake the world.\r\n\r\n    _Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNETTLES.... _Cruelty_.\r\n\r\n\r\nNettles may be considered the appropriate emblem of cruelty. How often,\r\nwhile in search of flowers, have we felt the sting of these unrelenting\r\nplants! We call that punishment cruel which visits us without our doing\r\nan injury which deserves it; and, as we never wished to be in the\r\nvicinity of the Nettles, nor, therefore, to injure them, our boyish\r\nfancy looked upon them as cruel.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                      Spare not the babe,\r\n    Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;\r\n    Think it a bastard, whom the oracle\r\n    Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,\r\n    And mince it sans remorse.\r\n\r\n    _Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                Do not insult calamity;\r\n    It is a barbarous grossness to lay on\r\n    The weight of scorn, where heavy misery\r\n    Too much already weighs men’s fortunes down.\r\n\r\n    _Daniel._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Oh, he’s accurst from all that’s good,\r\n      Who never knew Love’s healing power;\r\n    Such sinner on his sins must brood,\r\n      And wait alone his hour.\r\n    If stranger to earth’s beauty--human love,\r\n    There is no rest below, nor hope above.\r\n\r\n    _Dana._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLUMBINE.... _Desertion_.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Bring Lilies for a maiden’s grave,\r\n        Roses to deck the bride,\r\n      Tulips for all who love through life\r\n        In brave attire to ride:\r\n    Bring each for each, in bower and hall,\r\n    But cull the Columbine for all.\r\n\r\n      “The Columbine? full many a flower\r\n        Hath hues more clear and bright,\r\n      Although she doth in purple go,\r\n        In crimson, pink, and white.\r\n    Why, when so many fairer shine,\r\n    Why choose the homely Columbine?”\r\n\r\n      Examine well each floweret’s form,--\r\n        Read ye not something more\r\n      Than curl of petal--depth of tint?\r\n        Saw ye ne’er aught before\r\n    That claims a fancied semblance there.\r\n    Amid those modelled leaves so fair?\r\n\r\n      Know ye the cap which Folly wears\r\n        In ancient masques and plays?\r\n      Does not the Columbine recall\r\n        That toy of olden days?\r\n    And is not folly reigning now\r\n    O’er many a wisdom-written brow?\r\n\r\n      ’Tis Folly’s flower, that homely one;\r\n        That universal guest\r\n      Makes every garden but a type\r\n        Of every human breast;\r\n    For though ye tend both mind and bower,\r\n    There’s still a nook for Folly’s flower.\r\n\r\n      Then gather roses for the bride,\r\n        Twine them in her bright hair,\r\n      But, ere the wreath be done--oh! let\r\n        The Columbine be there.\r\n    For rest ye sure that follies dwell\r\n    In many a heart that loveth well.\r\n\r\n      Gather ye laurels for the brow\r\n        Of every prince of song!\r\n      For all, to whom philosophy\r\n        And wisdom do belong.\r\n    But ne’er forget to intertwine\r\n    A flower or two of Columbine.\r\n\r\n      Forget it not;--for even they,\r\n        The oracles of earth,\r\n      Mid all their wealth of golden thoughts,\r\n        Their wisdom and their worth,\r\n    Sometimes play pranks beneath the sky,\r\n    Would scarce become e’en such as I!\r\n\r\n      Weave ye an armful of that plant,\r\n        Choosing the darkest flowers,\r\n      With that red, blood-dipped wreath ye bring\r\n        The devastating powers\r\n    Of warrior, conqueror, or chief;\r\n    Oh! twine that full of Folly’s leaf!\r\n\r\n      And do ye ask me why this flower\r\n        Is fit for every brow?\r\n      Tell me but one where Folly ne’er\r\n        Hath dwelt, nor dwelleth now,\r\n    And I will then the laurel twine,\r\n    Unmingled with the Columbine.\r\n\r\n    _Louisa A.

Hence its name and signification.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n          One more plant----\r\n    Which, consecrate to Salem’s peaceful King,\r\n    Though fair as any gracing beauty’s bower,\r\n    Is linked to sorrow like a holy thing,\r\n    And takes its name from suffering’s fiercest hour.\r\n    Be this my noblest theme--Imperial Passion Flower!\r\n    Whatever impulse first conferred that name,\r\n    Or Fancy’s dream, or Superstition’s art,\r\n    I freely own its spirit-touching claim,\r\n    With thoughts and feelings it may well impart.\r\n\r\n    _Barton._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Faith builds a bridge across the gulf of death,\r\n    To break the shock blind nature cannot shun,\r\n    And lands thought smoothly on the further shore.\r\n\r\n    _Young._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    True faith nor biddeth nor abideth form.\r\n    The bended knee, the eye uplift is all\r\n    Which man need render; all which God can bear.\r\n    What to the faith are forms?

Under\r\nall its diversities, however, it retains its delicious, spicy fragrance,\r\nand hence has been made the emblem of woman’s love, which no\r\ncircumstance can change. Florists designate two principal divisions of\r\nthese flowers, Pinks and Carnation. The former are marked by a spot\r\nresembling an eye, and by a more humble growth. The flower of the\r\nCarnation is much larger than that of the Pink, and of a deeper hue. The\r\nCarnation was called by some of the old English writers the clove-gilly\r\nflower, from its perfume resembling that of cloves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                    She never told her love,\r\n    But let concealment, like a worm i’ the bud,\r\n    Feed on her damask cheek; she pined in thought;\r\n    And with a green and yellow melancholy,\r\n    She sat (like Patience on a monument)\r\n    Smiling at grief.\r\n\r\n    _Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                        It is a fearful thing,\r\n    To love as I love thee; to feel the world--\r\n    The bright, the beautiful, joy giving world--\r\n    A blank without thee. Never more to me\r\n    Can hope, joy, fear, wear different seeming. Now\r\n    I have no hope that does not dream for thee;\r\n    I have no joy that is not shared by thee;\r\n    I have no fear that does not dread for thee.\r\n\r\n    _L. E. L._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Alas! the love of woman! it is known\r\n    To be a lovely and a fearful thing;\r\n    For all of theirs upon that die is thrown,\r\n    And, if ’tis lost, life has no more to bring\r\n    To them but mockeries of the past alone.\r\n\r\n    _Byron._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSENSITIVE PLANT.... _Chastity_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis singular plant is so named from its motions imitating the\r\nsensibility of animal life. It contracts itself in the evening and\r\nexpands with the morning light, and shrinks from external violence,\r\nfolding up its leaves at the mere approach of one’s hand. The Violet is\r\nthe emblem of that retiring modesty which proceeds from reflection, but\r\nthe Sensitive Plant is a perfect image of innocence and virgin modesty,\r\nthe result of instinct.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    So dear to heaven is saintly chastity,\r\n    That when a soul is found sincerely so,\r\n    A thousand liveried angels lackey her,\r\n    Driving far off each thing of sin and guilt.\r\n\r\n    _Milton._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Oh! she is colder than the mountain’s snow.\r\n    To such a subtile purity she’s wrought,\r\n    She’s prayed and fasted to a walking thought:\r\n    She’s an enchanted feast, most fair to sight,\r\n    And starves the appetite she does invite;\r\n    Flies from the touch of sense, and if you dare\r\n    To name but love she vanishes to air.\r\n\r\n    _Crown._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    In thy fair brow there’s such a legend writ\r\n    Of chastity, as blinds the adulterous eye:\r\n    Not the mountain ice,\r\n    Congealed to crystals, is so frosty chaste\r\n    As thy victorious soul, which conquers man,\r\n    And man’s proud tyrant-passion.\r\n\r\n    _Dryden._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Like the Mimosa shrinking from\r\n      The blight of some familiar finger--\r\n    Like flowers which but in secret bloom,\r\n      Where aye the sheltered shadows linger,\r\n    And which beneath the hot noon-ray\r\n    Would fold their leaves and fade away--\r\n    The flowers of Love in secret cherished,\r\n    In loneliness and silence nourished,\r\n      Shrink backward from the searching eye,\r\n    Until the stem whereon they flourished,\r\n    Their shrine, the human heart, has perished,\r\n      Although themselves may never die.\r\n\r\n    _J. G. Whittier._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHYME.... _Activity_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient Greeks, Thyme denoted the graceful elegance of the\r\nAttic style; because it covered Mount Hymettus, and gave an aromatic\r\nflavour to the honey made there. Those writers who had mastered the\r\nAttic style were said “to smell of Thyme.” Flies of all shapes, beetles\r\nof all hues, bright butterflies, and vigilant bees for ever surround the\r\nflower tufts of Thyme, and they thus seem to teem with life. Activity is\r\na warlike virtue, and is ever associated with true courage. On this\r\nnotion, the ladies of the days of chivalry embroidered on the scarfs\r\nwhich they presented to their knights the figure of a bee hovering about\r\na sprig of Thyme.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I am not old,--though years have cast\r\n      Their shadows on my way;\r\n    I am not old,--though youth has passed,\r\n      On rapid wings away.\r\n    For in my heart a fountain flows,\r\n    And round it pleasant thoughts repose;\r\n    And sympathies, and feelings high,\r\n    Spring like stars on evening’s sky.\r\n\r\n    _Park Benjamin._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The thrifty Thyme a home can find,\r\n    Where smiles the sun, and breathes the wind.\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. Hale._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                      Take the instant way;\r\n    For honour travels in a strait so narrow,\r\n    Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;\r\n    For emulation hath a thousand sons,\r\n    That one by one pursue: if you give way,\r\n    Or edge aside from the direct forthright,\r\n    Like to an entered tide, they all rush by,\r\n    And leave you hindmost.\r\n\r\n    _Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                      The keen spirit\r\n    Seizes the prompt occasion,--makes the thought\r\n    Start into instant action, and at once\r\n    Plans and performs, resolves and executes.\r\n\r\n    _Hannah More._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Come, I have learned, that fearful commenting\r\n    Is laden servitor to dull delay;\r\n    Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary.\r\n    Then fiery expedition be my wing,\r\n    Jove’s Mercury, and herald for a king!\r\n    Go, muster men: my counsel is my shield:\r\n    We must be brief, when traitors brave the field.\r\n\r\n    _Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Rouse thee! wake thy soul from sadness;\r\n      Fail not in the eager strife!\r\n    See around the bright earth’s gladness,--\r\n      All activity and life!\r\n\r\n    _Peerbold._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLLYHOCK.... _Ambition_.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have few flowers that contribute more to the ornamenting of large\r\ngardens than the Hollyhock, which, from its towering height and seeming\r\nlove of display, is the emblem of ambition. The flowers are of all hues,\r\nfrom a blackish-purple to a faint white, and, though very beautiful, are\r\nwithout fragrance. They give gayety to the shrubbery until a late season\r\nof the year, throwing out a succession of flowers till the arrival of\r\nfrost.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                      Yet, press on!\r\n    For it shall make you mighty among men;\r\n    And, from the eyrie of your eagle thought,\r\n    Ye shall look down on monarchs.

Watson._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLAUREL.... _Glory_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the ancient Greeks and Romans, the Laurel was consecrated to every\r\nspecies of glory. The beautiful shrub grows abundantly at Delphi, on the\r\nbanks of the river Peneus. There its aromatic and evergreen branches\r\nshoot up to the height of the loftiest trees; and it is alleged that, by\r\nmeans of some secret virtue, they avert lightning from the spots which\r\nthey adorn.\r\n\r\nAccording to ancient fable, Daphne was the daughter of the river Peneus.\r\nApollo fell in love with her, but she, preferring virtue to the love of\r\nthe most eloquent of the gods, fled, in order to avoid the seducing\r\nmagic of his words. Apollo pursued, and was on the point of overtaking\r\nher, when the nymph invoked her father, and was changed into a Laurel.\r\nThe god, finding that he clasped an insensible tree in his arms, kissed\r\nits bright leaves. “Since thou canst not be my spouse,” said he, “thou\r\nshalt, at least, be my tree.” Thence-forward the Laurel was sacred to\r\nApollo.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Ambition! ambition! I’ve laughed to scorn\r\n      Thy robe and thy gleaming sword;\r\n    I would follow sooner a woman’s eye,\r\n      Or the spell of a gentle word.\r\n    But come with the glory of human mind,\r\n      And the light of the scholar’s brow,\r\n    And my heart shall be taught forgetfulness,\r\n      And alone at thy altar bow.\r\n\r\n    _Willis._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Give me the trumpet tone of fame,\r\n    The victor’s wreath, the hero’s name;\r\n    Though bites the steel and clanks the chain,\r\n    I would a warrior’s glory gain,\r\n    A nation’s pet and idol be,\r\n    With slaves to crouch and bend the knee.\r\n\r\n    _W. H. C._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    What is glory? What is fame?\r\n    The echo of a long-lost name;\r\n    A breath, an idle hour’s brief talk;\r\n    The shadow of an arrant naught;\r\n    A flower that blossoms for a day,\r\n      Dying next morrow;\r\n    A stream that hurries on its way,\r\n      Singing of sorrow.\r\n\r\n    _Motherwell._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    In poet’s lore, and sentimental story,\r\n      It seems as ’twere this life’s supremest aim\r\n    For heroes to achieve what men call glory,\r\n      And die intoxicate with earth’s acclaim.\r\n    Ah me! how little care the dead for breath\r\n    Of vain applause that saved them not from death.\r\n\r\n    _MacKellar._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    To die, and leave some worthy work to earth,\r\n    Is but a fine transition. ’Tis to leave\r\n    A talisman to call the spirit back,\r\n    Reft of its ground-born tenement.\r\n\r\n    _C. Watson._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAMARANTH.... _Immortality_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Amaranth is unfading; and it has, therefore, been made the emblem of\r\nimmortality. In Homer’s time, it was customary to wear crowns of\r\nAmaranth at the funerals of distinguished personages. Milton, in his\r\nLycidas, classes it among the flowers that “sad embroidery wear.” In the\r\nfloral games at Toulouse, the principal prize was a golden Amaranth for\r\nthe best lyric composition. The Amaranthus hypochondriacus, one of the\r\nAmerican species, is better known by the name of Prince’s Feather.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    There’s a yearning that’s felt in your heart’s deepest cell,\r\n    And silently, vainly, within doth it swell;\r\n    And, scorning the hopes of the children of earth,\r\n    Seeks the bright home of its heavenly birth;\r\n    And that yearning, unquenched in the heart will lie,\r\n    Till refreshed by a draught from eternity.\r\n\r\n    _Miss Larcom._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                      Oh, listen man!\r\n    A voice within us speaks that startling word,\r\n    “Man, thou shalt never die!” Celestial voices\r\n    Hymn it unto our souls: according harps,\r\n    By angel fingers touched, when the mild stars\r\n    Of morning sang together, sound forth still\r\n    The song of our great immortality.\r\n\r\n    _Dana._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Immortal Amaranth! a flower which once\r\n    In paradise, fast by the tree of life\r\n    Began to bloom; but soon, for man’s offence,\r\n    To heaven removed, where first it grew, there grows\r\n    And flowers aloft, shading the tree of life.\r\n\r\n    _Milton._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    There are distinctions that will live in heaven,\r\n    When time is a forgotten circumstance!\r\n    The elevated brow of kings will lose\r\n    The impress of regalia, and the slave\r\n    Will wear his immortality as free\r\n    Beside the crystal waters; but the depth\r\n    Of glory in the attributes of God\r\n    Will measure the capacities of mind;\r\n    And, as the angels differ, will the ken\r\n    Of gifted spirits glorify Him more.\r\n\r\n    _Willis._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Were death annihilation--were this life\r\n    A lamp extinguished, ne’er to be relit,--\r\n    Then words of deep despondency were fit;\r\n    Then man perchance might lift his arm in strife\r\n    Against his LORD. Were blessedness of mind\r\n    Dependent on the vastness of the heap\r\n    Of gold and gems the schemers ’mong mankind\r\n    Could gather--then ’twere virtuous to weep.\r\n    But ’tis not so. Infinity of time\r\n    Is yet to be. Beyond our vision lie\r\n    Eternal realms, ineffably sublime\r\n    And beautiful.\r\n\r\n    _MacKellar._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRAWBERRY.... _Perfection_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn eminent French author conceived the plan of writing a general history\r\nof nature, after the model of the ancients. A Strawberry plant, which,\r\nperchance, grew under his window, deterred him from this bold design. He\r\nexamined the Strawberry, and, in so doing, discovered so many wonders,\r\nthat he felt convinced the study of a single plant was sufficient to\r\noccupy a whole lifetime. He therefore gave up the pompous title which he\r\nhad meditated for his work, and contented himself with calling it\r\n“Studies of Nature.” The flowers of the Strawberry form pretty bouquets;\r\nbut, as the delicious fruit is preferred to the flower, they are seldom\r\nplucked for that purpose. Among the glaciers of the Alps, the plants and\r\nflowers of the Strawberry are found in all seasons of the year. The\r\nplant seems to possess all the merits of plants, in their greatest\r\nperfection. The berries are the favourite accompaniment of the lordly\r\nfeast and the most exquisite luxury of the rural repast. They vie in\r\nfreshness and perfume with the buds of the sweetest flowers; delighting\r\nthe eye, the taste, and smell, at the same time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Let other bards of angels sing,\r\n      Bright suns without a spot;\r\n    But thou art no such perfect thing:\r\n      Rejoice that thou art not!\r\n\r\n    _Wordsworth._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    She’s noble--noble, one to keep\r\n    Embalmed for dreams of fevered sleep.\r\n    An eye for nature--taste refined,\r\n    Perception swift--and balanced mind,--\r\n    And, more than all, a gift of thought\r\n    To such a spirit fineness wrought,\r\n    That on my ear her language fell\r\n    As if each word dissolved a spell.\r\n\r\n    _Willis._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Oh! do not die, for we shall hate\r\n      All women so when you are gone,\r\n    That thee I shall not celebrate,\r\n      When I remember thou wast one.\r\n    But yet thou canst not die, I know;\r\n      To leave this world behind is death;\r\n    But when thou from this world wilt go,\r\n      The whole world vapours in thy breath.\r\n\r\n    _Donne._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Were I to give my frolic fancy play,\r\n    I’d sing of her as some angelic sprite,\r\n    Who, wandering from her native home of light,\r\n    Fatigued, had fallen asleep upon the way;--\r\n    I’d fear to wake her, lest she’d plume her wings\r\n    And soar away from me and all sublunar things.\r\n\r\n    _MacKellar._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNFLOWER.... _False Riches_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sunflower has been thus named from the resemblance which its broad\r\ngolden disk and rays bear to the sun. The first Spaniards who arrived in\r\nPeru were amazed at the profuse display of gold among the people, but\r\nthey were still more astonished when, in May, they beheld whole fields\r\ncovered with these flowers, which they concluded, at first sight, must\r\nbe of the same precious metal. From this circumstance, and the\r\nobservation that gold, however abundant, cannot render a person truly\r\nrich, the Sunflower has been made the emblem of false wealth. Many of\r\nthe English poets have adopted the notion that this flower ever turns\r\nits face to the sun. Thomson, Moore, Darwin, and Barton make a very fine\r\nuse of the idea. But it is not a fact. Those flowers which face the east\r\nat the opening of day, never turn to the west at the close of it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Searcher of gold, whose days and nights\r\n      All waste away in anxious care,\r\n    Estranged from all of life’s delights,\r\n      Unlearned in all that is most fair--\r\n    Who sailest not with easy glide,\r\n    But delvest in the depths of tide,\r\n      And strugglest in the foam;\r\n    O! come and view this land of graves,\r\n    Death’s northern sea of frozen waves,\r\n      And mark thee out thy home.\r\n\r\n    _J.

It is often confounded with the\r\nSunflower, though it is of a different genus. The blossoms of the\r\nHeliotrope form clusters of very small, delicate, fragrant flowers,\r\ngenerally of a faint purple colour or white, sometimes red, or\r\nbluish-white. It is a general favourite of the fair sex, and is\r\nconsidered as the emblem of devoted affection, on account of its face\r\nbeing ever turned to the sun, which it seems to worship. The Heliotrope\r\nwas introduced into Europe in 1740, by the celebrated Jussieu.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    As laurel leaves, that cease not to be green,\r\n    From parching sonne, nor yet from winter’s threat,--\r\n    As hardened oak, that fears no sworde so keen,--\r\n    As flint for tool, in twaine that will not fret,--\r\n    As fast as rock, or pillar surely set,--\r\n    So fast am I to you, and aye have been,\r\n    Assuredly whom I cannot forget;\r\n    For joy, for paine, for torment, nor for tene;\r\n    For loss, for gaine, for frowning, nor for threat;\r\n    For ever one, yea, both in calm and blast,\r\n    Your faithful love, and will be to the last!\r\n\r\n    _Old Poet. 1555._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Yet do not think I doubt thee;\r\n      I know thy truth remains;\r\n    I would not live without thee,\r\n      For all the world contains.\r\n    Thou art the star that guides me\r\n      Along life’s troubled sea;--\r\n    Whatever fate betides me,\r\n      This heart still turns to thee.\r\n\r\n    _G. P. Morris._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                    He on his side\r\n    Leaning half-raised, with looks of cordial love\r\n    Hung over her enamoured, and beheld\r\n    Beauty, which, whether waking or asleep,\r\n    Shot forth peculiar graces.\r\n\r\n    _Milton._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                      Like Ixion,\r\n    I look on Juno, feel my heart turn to cinders\r\n    With an invisible fire; and yet, should she\r\n    Deign to appear clothed in a various cloud,\r\n    The majesty of the substance is so sacred\r\n    I durst not clasp the shadow. I behold her\r\n    With adoration, feast my eye, while all\r\n    My other senses starve; and, oft frequenting\r\n    The place which she makes happy with her presence,\r\n    I never yet had power, with tongue or pen,\r\n    To move her to compassion, or make known\r\n    What ’tis I languish for; yet I must gaze still,\r\n    Though it increase my flame.\r\n\r\n    _Massinger._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMIGNONETTE.... _Your Qualities surpass your Charms_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mignonette was introduced into Europe from Egypt, in 1750. It\r\nflowers from the beginning of spring until the end of autumn. Linnæus,\r\nwho gave it the name of _Reseda odorata_, compares its perfume with that\r\nof ambrosia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    No gorgeous flowers the meek Reseda grace,\r\n    Yet sip, with eager trunk, yon busy race\r\n    Her simple cup, nor heed the dazzling gem\r\n    That beams in Fritillaria’s diadem.\r\n\r\n    _Evans._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I see her now within my view,--\r\n    A spirit, yet a woman too!--\r\n    Her household motions light and free,\r\n    And steps of virgin liberty;\r\n    A countenance in which do meet\r\n    Sweet records, promises as sweet;\r\n    A creature not too bright or good\r\n    For human nature’s daily food.\r\n\r\n    _Wordsworth._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                    Time has small power\r\n    O’er features the mind moulds. Roses where\r\n    They once have bloomed a fragrance leave behind;\r\n    And harmony will linger on the wind;\r\n    And suns continue to light up the air,\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MIGNIONETTE, PINK, PINK BUD.\r\n\r\n_Your qualities surpassing your charms, have drawn from me a confession\r\nof pure love._]\r\n\r\n    When set; and music from the broken shrine Breathes,\r\n    it is said, around whose altar-stone His flower the votary has ceased to\r\n    twine:--Types of the beauty that, when youth is gone, Breathes from the\r\n    soul whose brightness mocks decline.\r\n\r\n    _George Hill._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Rudely thou wrongest my deare heart’s desire,\r\n      In finding fault with her too portly pride;\r\n    The thing which I do most in her admire,\r\n      Is of the world unworthy most envied.\r\n    For in those lofty looks is close implied\r\n      Scorn of base things,--disdain of foul dishonour,\r\n    Threatening rash eyes which gaze on her so wide\r\n      That loosely they ne dare to look upon her!\r\n\r\n    _Spenser._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJASMINE.... _Amiability_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Jasmine is a happy emblem of an amiable disposition. In all\r\nsituations, it suffers the gardener to train its slender branches into\r\nany form he chooses: most commonly forming a living tapestry for arbours\r\nand garden walls, and everywhere throwing out a profusion of delicate\r\nand charming flowers, which perfume the air. The poets have showered\r\ntheir praise upon this plant, and all unite in considering it the emblem\r\nof the winsome quality of amiability. After paying a glowing tribute to\r\nthe beauty and sweetness of the Violet, Thomas Miller, the\r\n“basket-maker” poet, thus speaks of the Jasmine:--\r\n\r\nStepping further into summer, comes the star-white Jasmine,--that sweet\r\nperfumer of the night, which only throws out its full fragrance when its\r\nsister stars are keeping watch in the sky; as if, when the song of the\r\nnightingale no longer cheered the darkness, it sent forth its silent\r\naroma upon the listening air. Many a happy home does it garland, and\r\npeeps in at many a forbidden lattice, where Love and Beauty repose.\r\nLittle did the proud courtiers and stately dames of Queen Elizabeth’s\r\nday dream that this sweet-scented creeper (a sprig of which seemed to\r\nmake the haughty haughtier still) would one day become so common as to\r\ncluster around and embower thousands of humble English cottages,--a\r\ndegradation which, could they but have witnessed, would almost have made\r\nevery plait of their starched ruffs bristle up, like “quills upon the\r\nfretful porcupine.” Beautiful are its long, drooping, dark-green shoots,\r\ntrailing around the trellis-work of a door-way, like a green curtain\r\nembroidered with silver flowers; while here and there the queenly\r\nMoss-Rose, creeping in and out like the threads of a fanciful tapestry,\r\nits crimson face amid the embowered green,--a beautiful lady peeping\r\nthrough a leaf-clad casement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    A lover on the Indian Sea,\r\n      Sighing for her left far behind,\r\n    Inhaled the scented Jasmine tree,\r\n      As it perfumed the evening wind:\r\n    Shoreward he steered at dawn of day,\r\n      And saw the coast all round embowered,\r\n    And brought a starry sprig away,\r\n      For her by whose green cot it flowered.\r\n\r\n    And oft when from that scorching shore,\r\n      In after years those odours came,\r\n    He pictured his green cottage door,\r\n      The shady porch, and window-frame,\r\n    Far, far away, across the foam:\r\n      The very Jasmine-flower that crept\r\n    Round the thatched roof about his home,\r\n      Where she he loved then safely slept.\r\n\r\n    _Miller._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWOODBINE, OR HONEYSUCKLE.... _Affection_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis elegant, climbing shrub at once delights the eye and gratifies the\r\nsmell, by the exquisite fragrance of its blossoms; while it confers on\r\nthose humble dwellings in the rural districts of England and America, a\r\ncharacter of cheerfulness unknown in other countries. It begins to\r\nflower in May, and puts forth its blossoms until the end of summer. It\r\nis chosen as the emblem of affection, from its clinging to trees and\r\nlattices with all the ardour and constancy of a weak, confiding woman,\r\nclinging to one of the stronger, sterner sex, in prosperity and in\r\nadversity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Copious of flowers, the woodbine pale and wan,\r\n    But well compensating her sickly looks\r\n    With never-cloying odours, early and late.\r\n\r\n    _Cowper._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Sister, sister, what dost thou twine?\r\n    I am weaving a wreath of the wild Woodbine;\r\n    I have streaked it without like the sunset hue,\r\n    And silvered it white with the morning dew:\r\n    And there is not a perfume which on the breeze blows\r\n    From the lips of the Pink or the mouth of the Rose,\r\n    That’s sweeter than mine--that’s sweeter than mine:\r\n    I have mingled them all in my wild Woodbine.\r\n\r\n    _Miller._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    A Honeysuckle, on the sunny side,\r\n    Hung round the lattices its fragrant trumpets.\r\n\r\n    _Miss Landon._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Ah! could you look into my heart,\r\n      And watch your image there!\r\n    You would own the sunny loveliness\r\n      Affection makes it wear.\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. Osgood._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The pensive soul with ardent thirsting turns\r\n    To heaven and earth to seek its fill of love.\r\n\r\n    _MacKellar._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Oh! there is one affection which no stain\r\n      Of earth can ever darken;--when two find,\r\n    The softer and the manlier, that a chain\r\n      Of kindred taste has fastened mind to mind.\r\n    ’Tis an attraction from all sense refined;\r\n    The good can only know it; ’tis not blind,\r\n    As love is unto baseness; its desire\r\n    Is but with hands entwined to lift our being higher.\r\n\r\n    _Percival._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOWSLIP.... _Pensiveness_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe solitary Cowslip was known to the old English poets as the “sweet\r\nnun of the fields,” and has been immortalized in “Shakspeare’s Midsummer\r\nNight’s Dream.” In America, the Cowslip may be found from Maine to\r\nMissouri. Its hues are not gaudy, but winning; and the whole appearance\r\nof the flower, as it blooms in some solitary vale, or on some gentle\r\nslope, expresses the idea of pensive beauty.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The rose its blushes need not lend,\r\n    Nor yet the lily with them blend,\r\n      To captivate my eyes:\r\n    Give me a cheek the heart obeys,\r\n    And, sweetly mutable, displays\r\n      Its feelings as they rise;\r\n    Features, where pensive, more than gay,\r\n    Save when a rising smile doth play,\r\n      The sober thoughts you see;\r\n    Eyes that all soft and tender seem,\r\n    And kind affections round them beam,\r\n      But most of all on me.\r\n\r\n    _Frisbie._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                      There is a mood,\r\n    (I sing not to the vacant and the young,)\r\n    There is a kindly mood of melancholy\r\n    That wings the soul, and points her to the skies.\r\n\r\n    _Dyer._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Oh! fragrant dwellers of the lea,\r\n      When first the wildwood rings\r\n    With each sound of vernal minstrelsy,\r\n      When fresh the green grass springs!\r\n    What can the blessed spring restore\r\n      More gladdening than your charms?\r\n    Bringing the memory once more\r\n      Of lovely fields and farms!\r\n    Of thickets, breezes, birds, and flowers;\r\n      Of life’s unfolding prime;\r\n    Of thoughts as cloudless as the hours;\r\n      Of souls without a crime.\r\n    Oh! blessed, blessed do ye seem,\r\n      For, even now, I turned,\r\n    With soul athirst for wood and stream,\r\n      From streets that glared and burned.\r\n    From the hot town, where mortal care\r\n      His crowded fold doth pen;\r\n    Where stagnates the polluted air\r\n      In many a sultry den.\r\n    And ye are here! and ye are here!\r\n      Drinking the dew-like wine,\r\n    Midst living gales and waters clear,\r\n      And heaven’s unstinted shine.\r\n    I care not that your little life\r\n      Will quickly have run through,\r\n    And the sward, with summer children rife,\r\n      Keep not a trace of you.\r\n    For again, again, on dewy plain,\r\n      I trust to see you rise,\r\n    When spring renews the wildwood strain,\r\n      And bluer gleam the skies.\r\n    Again, again, when many springs\r\n      Upon my grave shall shine,\r\n    Here shall you speak of vanished things,\r\n      To living hearts of mine.\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. Howitt._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Blest are the pure and simple hearts,\r\n      Unconsciously refined,\r\n    By the free gifts that Heaven imparts\r\n      Through nature to the mind;\r\n    Not all the pleasures wealth can buy\r\n    Equal their happy destiny.\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. Wells._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    O Nature! a’ thy shows an’ forms\r\n    To feeling, pensive hearts hae charms!\r\n    Whether the simmer kindly warms,\r\n                    Wi’ life an’ light.\r\n    Or winter howls, in gusty storms,\r\n                    The lang, dark night!\r\n\r\n    _Burns._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                      Melancholy\r\n    Sits on me, as a cloud along the sky,\r\n    Which will not let the sunbeams through, nor yet\r\n    Descend in rain, and end; but spreads itself\r\n    ’Twixt heaven and earth, like envy between man\r\n    And man--an everlasting mist.\r\n\r\n    _Byron._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORGET-ME-NOT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name of this flower expresses clearly enough the meaning which is\r\ngiven to it. As a remembrancer it is universally received and eulogized.\r\nThe name is derived from a German tradition, full of melancholy romance.\r\nIt is related that a young couple, on the eve of being united, while\r\nwalking along the banks of the Danube, saw a cluster of these flowers,\r\nfloating on the stream, which was bearing it away. The affianced bride\r\nadmired the beauty of the flower, and lamented its fatal destiny. The\r\nlover plunged into the water to secure it. No sooner had he caught it\r\nthan he found himself sinking; but, making a last effort, he threw it on\r\nthe bank at the feet of his betrothed, and, at the moment of\r\ndisappearing for ever, exclaimed, “_Vergiss mein nicht!_” Since that\r\nevent, this flower has been made emblematical of the sentiment,\r\nForget-me-not. Its corollas are of a soft cerulean-blue colour, and it\r\npresents an interesting appearance as it grows along the banks of the\r\nrivers. The Forget-me-not is found in great perfection on the banks of a\r\nsmall stream near Luxembourg, in France. The stream is called the\r\nFairies’ Bath, and its banks are the favourite resort of festive\r\nparties.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    That blue and bright-eyed floweret of the brook,\r\n    Hope’s gentle gem--the fair Forget-me-not.\r\n\r\n    _Coleridge._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Not on the mountain’s shelving side,\r\n      Nor in the cultivated ground,\r\n    Nor in the garden’s painted pride,\r\n      The flower I seek is found.\r\n    Where Time on sorrow’s page of gloom\r\n      Has fixed its envious lot,\r\n    Or swept the record from the tomb,\r\n      It says Forget me not.\r\n    And this is still the loveliest flower,\r\n      The fairest of the fair,\r\n    Of all that deck my lady’s bower,\r\n      Or bind her floating hair.\r\n\r\n    _Göthe._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Together they sate by a river’s side,\r\n      A knight and a lady gay,\r\n    And they watched the deep and eddying tide\r\n      Round a flowery islet stray.\r\n    And, “Oh! for that flower of brilliant hue,”\r\n      Said then the lady fair,\r\n    “To grace my neck with the blossoms blue\r\n      And braid my nut-brown hair!”\r\n    The knight has plunged in the whirling wave\r\n      All for his lady’s smile:\r\n    And he swims the stream with courage brave,\r\n      And he gains yon flowery isle.\r\n    And his fingers have cropped the blossoms blue,\r\n      And the prize they backward bear;\r\n    To deck his love with the brilliant hue\r\n      And braid her nut-brown hair.\r\n    But the way is long, and the current strong,\r\n      And alas for that gallant knight!\r\n    For the waves prevail, and his stout arms fail,\r\n      Though cheered by his lady’s sight.\r\n    Then the blossoms blue to the bank he threw,\r\n      Ere he sank in the eddying tide;\r\n    And “Lady, I’m gone, thine own knight true,\r\n      Forget me not,” he cried.\r\n    This farewell pledge the lady caught;\r\n      And hence, as legends say,\r\n    The flower is a sign to awaken thought\r\n      In friends who are far away.\r\n    For the lady fair of her knight so true,\r\n      Still remembered the hapless lot:\r\n    And she cherished the flower of brilliant hue,\r\n    And she braided her hair with the blossoms blue\r\n      And then called it “Forget-me-not!”\r\n\r\n    _Mant._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    To flourish in my favourite bower,\r\n      To blossom round my cot,\r\n    I cultivate the little flower\r\n      They call Forget-me-not.\r\n    This pretty little floweret’s dye\r\n      Of soft cerulean blue,\r\n    Appears as if from Ellen’s eye\r\n      It had received its hue.\r\n    Though oceans now betwixt us roar,\r\n      Though distant be our lot,\r\n    Ellen! though we should meet no more,\r\n      Sweet maid, Forget me not!\r\n\r\n    _Anon._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Forget thee, love?--no, not while heaven\r\n      Spans its starred vault across the sky;\r\n    Oh, may I never be forgiven,\r\n      If e’er I cause that heart a sigh!\r\n    Sooner shall the Forget-me-not\r\n      Shun the fringed brook by which it grows,\r\n    And pine for some sequestered spot,\r\n      Where not a silver ripple flows.\r\n    By the blue heaven that bends above me,\r\n    Dearly and fondly do I love thee!\r\n    They fabled not in days of old\r\n      That Love neglected soon will perish,--\r\n    Throughout all time the truth doth hold\r\n      That what we love we ever cherish,\r\n    For when the Sun neglects the Flower,\r\n      And the sweet pearly dews forsake it,\r\n    It hangs its head, and from that hour,\r\n      Prays only unto Death to take it.\r\n    So may I droop, by all above me,\r\n    If once this heart doth cease to love thee!\r\n    The turtle-dove that’s lost its mate,\r\n      Hides in some gloomy greenwood shade,\r\n    And there alone mourns o’er its fate,\r\n      With plumes for ever disarrayed:\r\n    Alone! alone! it there sits cooing:--\r\n      Deem’st thou, my love, what it doth seek?\r\n    ’Tis Death the mournful bird is wooing,\r\n      In murmurs through its plaintive beak.\r\n    So will I mourn, by all above me,\r\n    If in this world I cease to love thee!\r\n\r\n    _Miller._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nROSEMARY.... _Remembrance_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rosemary is so often mentioned by our early writers, both in prose,\r\npoetry, and our oldest dramas, that a long article, possessing great\r\ninterest to such as love old-fashioned things, might be written upon it.\r\nThe Rosemary was used both at their feasts and their funerals,--the\r\nchristening-cup was stirred with it, and it was worn at their marriage\r\nceremonies. Shakspeare has chosen it for the emblem of Remembrance, and\r\nwho would attempt to change the meaning of a flower which his genius has\r\nhallowed, or disturb a leaf over which he has breathed his holy\r\n“superstition?”--in memory of him we use the latter word in all\r\nreverence. A few years ago it was customary, in many parts of England,\r\nto plant slips of Rosemary over the dead; nor has the practice yet\r\nfallen altogether into disuse--rural cemeteries will revive these\r\nancient customs. Shakspeare chose the Rosemary as the emblem of\r\naffectionate remembrance, for its flowering in winter,--a very poetic\r\nand touching allusion. The sweet maniac, Ophelia, says,\r\n\r\n    There’s Rosemary, “That for remembrance,\r\n    I pray you love, remember.”\r\n\r\n    I loved thee, and must love thee still,\r\n      In memory of the past\r\n    Amid whate’er of earthly ill\r\n      My future lot is cast!\r\n    E’er in my boyhood’s sunny prime,\r\n    When brightly from the urn of Time\r\n      Life’s golden moments fell,\r\n    Thou wert a peri to my eyes,\r\n    Sent from Love’s own sweet paradise,\r\n      In my young heart to dwell.\r\n\r\n    _New York Mirror._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Remember me, I pray; but not\r\n      In Flora’s gay and blooming hour,\r\n    When every brake hath found its note,\r\n      And sunshine smiles in every flower;\r\n    But when the falling leaf is sere,\r\n      And withers sadly from the tree,\r\n    And o’er the ruins of the year\r\n      Cold autumn weeps,--remember me.\r\n\r\n    _Edward Everett._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The north wind howls; but, sheltered safe, and warm,\r\n      Howl as it may, we feel secure from danger:\r\n    The fire burns blue, “betokening a storm”--\r\n      A brand falls down, “precursor of a stranger.”\r\n    My thoughtful mind runs o’er the track of years,\r\n      When, tongs in hand, at our old hearth I sat,\r\n    And poked the embers, till my mother’s fears\r\n      Broke in upon the usual social chat,\r\n    “You’ll fire the chimney, son!” The sparks would fly,\r\n      Like little lumps of lightning up the flue,\r\n    And snap and crackle as they soared on high,\r\n      As if they felt some pleasure in it too!\r\n    That fire is out--that hearth is cold--and they\r\n    Who felt its pleasant warmth have mostly passed away.\r\n\r\n    _MacKellar._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANEMONE.... _Forsaken_.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnemone was a nymph, beloved by Zephyr. Flora, jealous of her, banished\r\nher from her court and transformed her into a flower, that blows before\r\nthe return of spring. Zephyr has abandoned this unhappy beauty to the\r\nrude caresses of Boreas, who, unable to gain her love, harshly shakes\r\nher, half opens her blossoms, and causes her immediately to fade. An\r\nAnemone, with these words, _Brevis est usus_--“Her reign is short”--is\r\ntouchingly expressive of the transitory nature of beauty.\r\n\r\nIn spring the green woods of merry England are covered with the flowers\r\nof the Anemone. Turn the eye whichever way you will, there it greets you\r\nlike “a pleasant thought;” it forms a bed of flowers around the foot of\r\nthe mighty oak, and below the tangling brambles, which you may peep\r\nbetween, but cannot pass,--there, also, are its pearly blossoms bending.\r\nThe Greeks named it the flower of the Wind, and so plentiful is it in\r\nour country that we might fancy the breeze had blown it everywhere. The\r\ngaudy Anemone of the garden, the emblem of forsaken love, is known to\r\nall; but our favourites are the uncultivated offspring of the windy\r\nwoods, which come long before the broad green leaves hang overhead to\r\nshelter them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    All flowers will droop in absence of the sun\r\n    That waked their sweets.\r\n\r\n    _Dryden._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Farewell! I’ve loved thee much!--I feel\r\n      That my idolatry was deep;\r\n    I know my heart can never heal,\r\n      Till in the grave my passions sleep.\r\n    Yet I upbraid thee not, my love;\r\n      ’Twas all I had to offer thee,\r\n      Love in its own simplicity.\r\n    How could I deem thou wouldst approve?\r\n    How hope to draw an angel from above?\r\n\r\n    _Willis._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACACIA.... _Friendship_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Acacia is a native of North America, from Canada to the Carolinas,\r\nand was consecrated by the Indians to the goddess of chaste love. Their\r\nbows were made of the incorruptible wood of this tree, and their arrows\r\nwere pointed with its thorns. About a century ago, this tree was\r\nintroduced into France by Robin, the botanist. It is a large, handsome\r\ntree, of quick growth, elegant foliage, and beautiful, rose-coloured\r\nblossoms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Celestial happiness!

Rousseau, so long the prey of his\r\nown passions, and tormented by those of other men, soothed the latter\r\nyears of his life by the study of nature. The Mosses, in particular,\r\nattracted his attention. It is these, he would say, that give a look of\r\nyouth and freshness to the fields, at the moment when the flowers have\r\ngone to their graves. In winter the Mosses offer to the eye of the lover\r\nof nature their carpet of emerald green, their secret nuptials, and the\r\ncharming mysteries of the urns and amphoræ which enclose their\r\nposterity. It is asserted that without the Mosses, part of our globe\r\nwould be uninhabitable. At the northern extremity of the earth, the\r\nLaplanders cover their subterranean abodes with Moss, and thus defy the\r\nlongest and most terrible winters. Their numerous herds of reindeer have\r\nno other food, yet they supply their owners with delicious milk,\r\nnutritious flesh, and warm clothing; thus combining for the poor\r\nLaplander all the advantages that we derive from the horse, cow, and\r\nsheep.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                              There is none\r\n    In all this cold and hollow world, no fount\r\n    Of deep, strong, deathless love, save that within\r\n    A mother’s heart.\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. Hemans._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The docile, swift Reindeer! Oh, when I was a child,\r\n    I loved all strange fantastic tales, the wondrous and the wild;\r\n    I read about the “Hundred Nights,” in the Arabian Tales,\r\n    That tell of Genii, sprites, and dwarfs, of gold and diamond vales.\r\n    I read of Eastern gardens and palaces so rare,\r\n    And of Sultans and Sultanas, the cruel and the fair.\r\n    I read of Robin Crusoe! Ah! how I loved that book!\r\n    Nor even yet hath its strong charm wholly my mind forsook.\r\n    I read of voyages without end; of travels many too,\r\n    And fairy-tales and story-books--of these, good sooth, not few.\r\n    But I remember, more than all, I loved to think and hear\r\n    Of thee--thou strong and beautiful--thou swift and good Reindeer!\r\n    I remember in my earliest home, a dim antique beaufet,\r\n    And high upon its many shelves, things manifold were set.\r\n    Some piles of dark old books there were, amid the motley crowd,\r\n    And when tall enough to reach them, oh! glad was I, and proud.\r\n    And there I found old Æsop, whose fables we all know,\r\n    And Cookery-books of ancient dates, most grim and well worn too.\r\n    These I just peeped at, and put back--and still went groping on\r\n    Deep into that small mine of wealth that I so late had won.\r\n    Soon with some daring tugs, I brought a lumbering volume slap\r\n    Down on the floor! I sat down too, and dragged it on my lap.\r\n    The binding was antique and worn--the title-page was out,\r\n    And yet the treasure won from me a child’s exultant shout;\r\n    For there were pictures many, of beast, and fish, and bird;\r\n    And _thou_ wert there, thou good Reindeer, of whom so much I’d heard.\r\n    And that great heavy ancient book was such a prize to me!\r\n    It told me of the monstrous whale, and the small good honey-bee;\r\n    It told me of the elephant, the tiger, the gazelle,\r\n    Of the vast luxuriant jungles, and the lone, bright desert well;\r\n    Of humming-birds that sip the dew of flowers as they fly,\r\n    Of prairies wild, and wide, and green; of snowy mountains high:\r\n    I read there of the Northern sea, where iceberg islands float,\r\n    And crush the great three-masted ship, as ’twere a cockle-boat;\r\n    I read about the harmless seals, and the shaggy Polar bear,\r\n    And the mighty troops of hungry wolves that roam and riot there.\r\n    I read of Nature’s glorious works, and wondering went on,\r\n    And found before me pleasures, whose round will ne’er be done.\r\n    And in my good old-fashioned book I read of herb and tree,\r\n    That were food for man, and beast and bird, and for the honey-bee.\r\n    I read of grove-like banyans, of cedars broad and tall,\r\n    Of the lofty towering palm, and the Moss and lichen small.\r\n    And then I found how wondrously the poor Reindeer was fed,\r\n    When over all his frozen land deep winter’s snow lay spread;\r\n    How GOD had bid the barren ground produce this strange small thing,\r\n    On which whole countless herds of deer are ever pasturing:\r\n    How, in the woods of scattered pine abundantly it grows,\r\n    And clothes the earth for many a mile beneath the trackless snows;\r\n    How the sagacious Reindeer delves, and scents his onward way,\r\n    Till he reaches his scant mossy food, that doth his toil repay.\r\n    Oh! see him with his master’s sledge! How swift they glide along,\r\n    Like a bird, or a fairy car I’ve read of, in some quaint old song.\r\n    Away! o’er the boundless snowy waste, so glittering and bright:\r\n    Away!--through the dark pine forest, as gloomy as the night:\r\n    Away o’er the frozen lake, the river, and the fen,\r\n    Away! Away!--Ye have winsome steeds, ye little Lapland men!\r\n    Ay, winsome steeds in sooth, with their antlers branched and high;\r\n    So sure of foot, and swift of pace, they truly seem to fly.\r\n    Ye need no palace-stables, no saucy pampered grooms,\r\n    To stretch your cracking purse-strings, and strut in liveried plumes;\r\n    No heavy half-year’s bills, for oats, beans, straw, and hay.\r\n    The forest yields them lodgment, and food, where’er they stray.\r\n    And thus we find, in every clime, things beautiful and fair,\r\n    Each fitted to fulfil its task of use and beauty there;\r\n    And I remember thinking so, when, a little child, I read\r\n    The history of the good Reindeer, and the Moss whereon they fed.\r\n\r\n    _Louisa A.

It is found in the four\r\nquarters of the globe, near the pole as beneath the equator, on the\r\nmargin of rivers and streams as well as on sterile rocks. It serves the\r\nshepherd instead of a clock, while its feathery tufts are his barometer,\r\npredicting calm or storm. The globes formed by the seeds of the\r\nDandelion are used for other purposes. If you are separated from the\r\nobject of your love, pluck one of those feathery spheres, charge each of\r\nthe little feathers with a tender thought; turn toward the spot where\r\nthe loved one dwells; blow, and the aërial travellers will faithfully\r\nconvey your secret message to his or her feet. If you wish to know if\r\nthat dear one is thinking of you, blow again; and if a single aigrette\r\nis left upon the stalk, it is a proof that you are not forgotten.\r\n\r\n                    As thinks\r\n    The mariner of home,\r\n    When doomed through many a dreary waste\r\n    Of waters yet to roam,--\r\n    Thus doth my spirit turn to thee,\r\n    My guiding star o’er life’s wild sea.\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. Embury._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Dandelion, with globe of down,\r\n    The schoolboy’s clock in every town,\r\n    Which the truant puffs amain,\r\n    To conjure lost hours back again.\r\n\r\n    _Howitt._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPIMPERNEL.... _The Weather-glass_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTRY MAID AND THE PIMPERNEL FLOWER.\r\n\r\n    “I’ll go and peep at the Pimpernel,\r\n    And see if she think the clouds look well;\r\n        For if the sun shine,\r\n        And ’tis like to be fine,\r\n        I shall go to the fair,\r\n        For my sweetheart is there:\r\n    So, Pimpernel, what bode the clouds and the sky?\r\n    If fair weather, no maiden so merry as I.”\r\n\r\n    Now the Pimpernel flower had folded up\r\n    Her little gold star in her coral cup,\r\n        And unto the maid\r\n        Thus her warning said:\r\n        “Though the sun smile down,\r\n        There’s a gathering frown\r\n    O’er the checkered blue of the clouded sky;\r\n    So tarry at home, for a storm is nigh.”\r\n\r\n    The maid first looked sad and then looked cross,\r\n    Gave her foot a fling, and her head a toss;\r\n        “Say you so, indeed,\r\n        You mean little weed?\r\n        You’re shut up for spite,\r\n        For the blue sky is bright,\r\n    To more credulous people your warnings tell,\r\n    I’ll away to the fair;--good day, Pimpernel.”\r\n\r\n    “Stay at home! quoth the flower?--In sooth, not I;\r\n    I’ll don my straw hat with a silken tie;\r\n        O’er my neck so fair\r\n        I’ll a kerchief wear,\r\n        White, chequered with pink,\r\n        And then--let me think,\r\n    I’ll consider my gown, for I’d fain look well:”\r\n    So saying, she stepped o’er the Pimpernel.\r\n\r\n    Now the wise little flower, wrapped safe from harm,\r\n    Sat fearlessly waiting the coming storm;\r\n        Just peeping between\r\n        Her snug cloak of green,\r\n        Lay folded up tight,\r\n        Her robe so bright;\r\n    Though ’broidered with purple, and starred with gold,\r\n    No eye might its bravery then behold.\r\n\r\n    The fair maiden straight donned her best array,\r\n    And forth to the festival hied away;\r\n        But scarce had she gone\r\n        Ere the storm came on;\r\n        And, ’mid thunder and rain,\r\n        She cried oft and again,\r\n    “Oh! would I had minded yon boding flower,\r\n    And were safe at home from the pelting shower.”\r\n\r\n    Now, maidens, the tale that I tell would say,\r\n    Don’t don fine clothes on a doubtful day,\r\n    Nor ask advice, when, like many more,\r\n    You had “made up your minds” some time before.\r\n\r\n    _Louisa A.

The White Poppy is\r\nsupposed to express, “My bane, my antidote.” The juice extracted from\r\nthese plants is employed to soothe the restless invalid to sleep, and to\r\nease the pangs of disease. According to the mythology of the Grecians,\r\nthe Poppy owed its origin to Ceres, who created it to assuage her grief,\r\nduring her search after her daughter Proserpine, who was carried off by\r\nPluto. The Poppy is extensively cultivated in Europe, for the purpose of\r\nmaking opium from it. Many species are cultivated in the garden. The\r\ndouble flowers possess surpassing beauty, whether we consider their\r\ndelicate texture, elegance of shape, or variety of colouring. In the\r\ntime of Gesner, the celebrated botanist of Switzerland, the village\r\nDamons and Chloes proved the sincerity of their lovers by placing in the\r\nhollow of the palm of the left-hand, a petal, or flower-leaf of the\r\nPoppy, which, on being struck by the other hand, was broken with a sharp\r\nsound, which denoted true attachment; but faithlessness, when it failed\r\nto snap.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The world has closed its eyes and fallen asleep;\r\n      And GOD looks down from His eternal throne\r\n    And shuts the eye that long was wont to weep,\r\n      And makes the wretched feel they’re not alone.\r\n\r\n    _MacKellar._\r\n\r\nPRIDE AND THE POPPIES.--THEIR GRANDEUR AND FALL.\r\n\r\n    “We little Red-caps are among the corn,\r\n    Merrily dancing at early morn,\r\n    We know that the farmer hates to see\r\n    Our saucy red faces; but here are we!\r\n\r\n    “We pay no price for our summer coats,\r\n    Like those slavish creatures, barley and oats;\r\n    We don’t choose to be ground and eat,\r\n    Like our heavy-head neighbour, Gaffer Wheat.\r\n\r\n    “Who dare thrash _us_, we should like to know!\r\n    Grind us, and bag us, and use us so!\r\n    Let meaner and shabbier things than we\r\n    So stupidly bend to utility!”\r\n\r\n    So said little Red-cap, and all the rout\r\n    Of the Poppy-clan set up a mighty shout;\r\n    Mighty for them, but if _you_ had heard\r\n    You had thought it the cry of a tiny bird.\r\n\r\n    So the Poppy-folk flaunted it over the field,\r\n    In pride of grandeur they nodded and reeled;\r\n    And shook out their jackets, till naught was seen,\r\n    But a wide, wide shimmer of scarlet and green.\r\n\r\n    The Blue-bottle sat on her downy stalk,\r\n    Quietly smiling at all their talk.\r\n    The Marigold still spread her rays to the sun,\r\n    And the purple Vetch climbed up to peep at the fun.\r\n\r\n    The whimsical Bugloss, vain, beautiful thing,\r\n    Whose flowers, like the orient butterfly’s wing,\r\n    Are deep, glowing azure, was eager to shed\r\n    O’er her yet unoped buds a delicate red;\r\n\r\n    First crimson, then purple, then loveliest blue;\r\n    E’en thrice doth she change her chameleon hue;\r\n    And she pities the flowers that grow merrily by,\r\n    Because in one dress they must bud, bloom, and die.\r\n\r\n    The homely Corn-cockle cared nothing, not she,\r\n    For the arrogance, bluster, and poor vanity\r\n    Of the proud Poppy-tribe, but she flourished and grew,\r\n    Content with herself, and her plain purple hue.\r\n\r\n    The sun went down, and rose bright on the morrow,\r\n    To some bringing joy, and to others e’en sorrow,\r\n    But blithe was the rich rosy farmer that morn\r\n    When he went with his reapers among the corn.\r\n\r\n    Forth went they betimes, a right merry band,\r\n    The sickles were glancing in each strong hand,\r\n    And the wealthy farmer came trotting along,\r\n    On his stiff little pony, mid whistle and song.\r\n\r\n    He trotted along, and he cracked his joke,\r\n    And chatted and laughed with the harvest-folk;\r\n    For the weather was settled, barometers high,\r\n    And heavy crops gladdened his practised eye.\r\n\r\n    “We’ll cut this barley to-day,” quoth he,\r\n    As he tied his white pony under a tree,\r\n    “Next to the upland wheat, and then the oats.”\r\n    How the Poppies shook in their scarlet coats!\r\n\r\n    Ay, shook with laughter, not fear, for they\r\n    Never dreamed they too should be swept away,\r\n    And their laughter was spite, to think that all\r\n    Their “useful” neighbours were doomed to fall.\r\n\r\n    They swelled and bustled with such an air,\r\n    The corn-fields quite in commotion were,\r\n    And the farmer cried, glancing across the grain,\r\n    “How those rascally weeds have come up again!”\r\n\r\n    “Ha! ha!” laughed the Red-caps, “ha! ha! what a fuss\r\n    Must the poor _weeds_ be in! how they’re envying _us_!”\r\n    But their mirth was cut short by the sturdy strokes\r\n    They speedily met from the harvest-folks.\r\n\r\n    And when low on the earth each stem was laid,\r\n    And the round moon looked on the havoc made,\r\n    A Blue-bottle propped herself half erect,\r\n    And made a short-speech--to this effect.\r\n\r\n    “My dying kins-flowers, and fainting friends,\r\n    The same dire fate alike attends\r\n    Those who in scarlet or blue are dressed;\r\n    Then how silly the pride that so late possessed\r\n\r\n    “Our friends the Red-caps!

Among the ancients, it was a favourite, and they adorned their\r\nfurniture, vases, and costly dresses, with its elegant leaves. When any\r\nobstacle obstructs the growth of the Acanthus, it puts forth fresh force\r\nand grows with additional vigour. Thus genius is strengthened by the\r\ndifficulties which it cannot overcome. Callimachus, an ancient\r\narchitect, derived the idea of the Corinthian capital, from seeing the\r\nleaves of an Acanthus surrounding a basket which had been set upon the\r\nground, and impeded the regular growth of the plant.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Tired at first sight with what the muse imparts,\r\n    In fearless youth we tempt the heights of arts,\r\n    While from the bounded level of our mind\r\n    Short views we take, nor see the length behind;\r\n    But, more advanced, behold with strange surprise\r\n    New distant scenes of endless science rise.\r\n\r\n    _Pope._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    For though I must confess an artist can\r\n    Contrive things better than another man,\r\n    Yet when the task is done, he finds his pains\r\n    Sought but to fill his belly with his brains.\r\n    Is this the guerdon due to liberal arts,\r\n    To admire the head and then to starve the parts?\r\n    Timely prevention though discreetly used\r\n    Before the fruits of knowledge were abused.\r\n    When learning has incurred a fearful damp,\r\n    To save our oil, ’tis good to quench the lamp.\r\n\r\n    _Lady Alimony._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    She had read\r\n    Her father’s well-filled library with profit,\r\n    And could talk charmingly. Then she would sing,\r\n    And play too, passably, and dance with spirit.\r\n    She sketched from nature well, and studied flowers,\r\n    Which was enough alone to love her for.\r\n    Yet she was knowing in all needlework,\r\n    And shone in dairy and in kitchen too,\r\n    As in the parlour.\r\n\r\n    _James N. Barker._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                      Art became the shadow\r\n    Of the dear star-light of thy haunting eyes!\r\n    They called me vain, some mad--I heeded not,\r\n    But still toiled on, hoped on, for it was surest,\r\n    If not to win, to feel more worthy thee.\r\n\r\n    _Bulwer._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVALERIAN.... _An accommodating Disposition_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Valerian was called by some of the old English writers the Setewale.\r\nIt is generally found growing by ruined walls or buildings, and from the\r\nfacility with which it propagates in these situations, it is made the\r\nemblem of an accommodating disposition. The root of the Valerian is\r\nconsidered a valuable remedy for many of those ailments which spring\r\nfrom luxurious living. It exerts a peculiar influence on the nervous\r\nsystem, revives the spirits, and strengthens the sight. The Valerian is\r\ntoo large and scrambling a plant to hold a place in the parterre of\r\nchoice flowers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    How much more happy is that sweet estate,\r\n      That neither creeps too low nor soars too high;\r\n    Which yields no matter for contempt or hate,\r\n      Which others not disdain, nor yet envy,\r\n    Which neither does nor takes an injury,\r\n      But living to itself in sweet content,\r\n      Is neither abject, nor yet insolent.\r\n\r\n    _1629. Herbert._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    My country, sir, is not a single spot\r\n    Of such a mould, or fixed to such a clime.\r\n\r\n    _Miller._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARVEL OF PERU.... _Timidity_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Marvel is a native of Peru, and receives its name from the wonderful\r\ndiversity of colours in flowers of the same root;\r\n\r\n    Changing from the splendid rose\r\n    To the pale violet’s dejected hue.\r\n\r\n    _Akenside._\r\n\r\nThis plant retains its beauty for a great length of time, being\r\nfrequently covered with blossoms from the beginning of July to the end\r\nof October. It is chosen as the emblem of timidity, because the flowers\r\nare too timid to expand during the day, and open and give out their\r\nfragrance at night.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Sure, ’twas his modesty.

Few\r\nflowering plants have been so much and so rapidly improved by\r\ncultivation as the Stock. Within the last two centuries, its nature has\r\nbeen almost entirely changed by the florist; and it is now a shrub whose\r\nbranches are covered with blossoms little inferior in dimensions to the\r\nrose. Stocks are produced of various colours, but the bright red or\r\ncarmine must ever remain the favourite variety. The principal branches\r\nof this fragrant family are the Ten-week Stock, so named from flowering\r\nabout ten weeks after it is sown; and the Brompton, which does not bloom\r\ntill about twelve months after sowing, and was first cultivated in the\r\nneighbourhood of Brompton, England.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Without the smile from partial beauty won,\r\n    Oh, what were man!--a world without a sun!\r\n\r\n    _Campbell._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Beauty has gone; but yet her mind is still\r\n    As beautiful as ever; still the play\r\n    Of light around her lips has every charm\r\n    Of childhood in its freshness.\r\n\r\n    _Percival._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The lily may die on thy cheek,\r\n      With freshness no longer adorning;\r\n    The rose that envelopes its whiteness may seek\r\n      To take back her mantle of morning;\r\n    Yet still will Love’s tenderness beam from thine eye,\r\n    And ask for that homage no heart can deny.\r\n\r\n    _Dawes._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                The glory of the human form\r\n    Is but a perishing thing, and Love will droop\r\n    When its brief grace hath faded.

The following anecdote will give the reason of its being\r\nchosen as the emblem of stupidity. Madame de Staël was always angry when\r\nany of her acquaintance attempted to introduce a stupid person into her\r\ncompany. One day, one of her friends ventured to bring to her a young\r\nSwiss officer of most prepossessing exterior. The lady, pleased with his\r\nappearance, was very lively, and said a thousand flattering things to\r\nthe new-comer, who seemed at first to be struck mute by surprise and\r\nadmiration. When, however, he had listened to her for above an hour\r\nwithout opening his lips, she began to suspect the cause of his silence,\r\nand put to him such direct questions that he could not help answering.\r\nHis answers were extremely silly! Madame de Staël, vexed at having\r\nthrown away her time and her wit, turned to her friend and said:\r\n“Indeed, sir, you are like my gardener, who thought to do me a pleasure\r\nby bringing me this morning a pot of Geranium: but I can tell you that I\r\nmade him take back the flower, desiring him not to let me see it any\r\nmore.” “And why so?” asked the young man in astonishment. “It was, since\r\nyou wish to know, because the Geranium is a beautiful scarlet flower;\r\nwhile you look at it, it pleases the eye; but when you press it ever so\r\nslightly, it gives out a disagreeable smell.” So saying, Madame de Staël\r\nrose and went out of the room, leaving the young fool abashed and in\r\nconfusion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;\r\n    And to do that well, craves a kind of wit.\r\n\r\n    _Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Your blunderer is as sturdy as a rock,\r\n    The creature is so sure to kick and bite,\r\n    A muleteer’s the man to set him right.\r\n    First appetite enlists him truth’s sworn foe,\r\n    Then obstinate self-will confirms him so.\r\n    Tell him he wanders; that his error leads\r\n    To fatal ill; that though the path he treads\r\n    Be flowery, and he see no cause of fear,\r\n    Death and the pains of hell attend him there.\r\n    In vain the slave of arrogance and pride,\r\n    He has no hearing on the prudent side.\r\n    His still refuted quirks he still repeats;\r\n    New raised objections with new quibbles meets;\r\n    Till sinking in the quicksand he defends,\r\n    He dies disputing, and the contest ends.\r\n\r\n    _Cowper._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    A set o’ dull conceited hashes,\r\n    Confuse their brains in college classes!\r\n    They gang in stirks, and come out asses,\r\n            Plain truth to speak;\r\n    An’ syne they think to climb Parnassus\r\n            By dint o’ Greek.\r\n    Gie me a spark o’ Nature’s fire,\r\n    That’s a’ the learning I desire;\r\n    Then tho’ I drudge thro’ dub an’ mire\r\n            At pleugh or cart,\r\n    My muse, tho’ hamely in attire,\r\n            May touch the heart.\r\n\r\n    _Burns._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The man who looks around him as he walks\r\n      Sees objects often wonderful and new;\r\n    And he who thinks while his companion talks\r\n      In time may grow the wiser of the two.\r\n    An open eye--a quick, attentive ear\r\n      Will lead the mind into the ways of knowledge;\r\n      For all the world’s a universal college,\r\n    And every one may be a learner here.\r\n      Experience is the teacher: dear, indeed,\r\n    Her charges are to thoughtless folks and fools;\r\n    But those who follow carefully her rules\r\n      The various tongues of nature learn to read.\r\n    Who seldom ploughs his mind shall reap but little;\r\n      Weeds quickly overspread the fallow soil;\r\n      The toiler may be wearied by his toil,\r\n    But it shall yield sufficiency of victual,\r\n      Enough for his own use, and much to spare.\r\n    To him who hath, abundance shall be given;\r\n      From him who squanders wastefully his share,\r\n    All that he has shall righteously be riven:\r\n      The world shall make a proverb of his name,\r\n      And he shall fill a sepulchre of shame.\r\n\r\n    _MacKellar._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOAK GERANIUM.... _Friendship_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Oak Geranium does not present so beautiful an appearance as the\r\nscarlet variety; but the pale blue colour of the flower, and the length\r\nof time which it continues in bloom, endear it to us as the emblem of\r\ntrue friendship.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    What though on Love’s altar the flame that is glowing\r\n      Is brighter?--yet Friendship’s is steadier far!\r\n    One wavers and turns with each breeze that is blowing,\r\n      And is but a meteor,--the other’s a star!\r\n            In youth Love’s light\r\n            Burns warm and bright,\r\n      But dies ere the winter of age be past,--\r\n            While Friendship’s flame\r\n            Burns ever the same,\r\n    And glows but the brighter, the nearer its last!\r\n\r\n    _Anon._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Thanks to my stars, I have not ranged about\r\n    The wilds of life, ere I could find a friend:\r\n    Nature first pointed out my brother to me,\r\n    And early taught me, by her sacred force,\r\n    To love thy person, ere I knew thy merit,\r\n    Till what was instinct grew up into friendship.\r\n    Ours has severest virtue for its basis,\r\n    And such a friendship ends not but with life.\r\n\r\n    _Addison._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    O!

It has since spread all over the\r\nworld. The flower is of a white colour, sometimes tinged with a blush of\r\npink. Its perfume is delicious and powerful; but if you would enjoy it\r\nwithout danger, keep at some distance from the plant. If you come with\r\nthe object of your affection to inhale its perfume by moonlight, when\r\nthe nightingale is pouring forth its ravishing melody, these odours will\r\nadd an inexpressible charm to your enjoyment; but, if, regardless of the\r\nprecepts of moderation, you approach too near, this divine flower will\r\nthen be but an enchantress who will pour a dangerous poison into your\r\nbosom. Thus the love which comes from above purifies and exalts; but\r\nthat which springs from earth debases and proves the bane of imprudent\r\nyouth.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Yes, Love is but a dangerous guest\r\n      For hearts as young as thine,\r\n    Where youth’s unshadowed joys should rest,\r\n      Life’s spring-time fancies shine.\r\n    Then, sweetest, leave the wildering dream,\r\n      Till Time has nerved thy heart\r\n    To brook the fitful cloud and gleam,\r\n      Which must in love have part.\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. Osgood._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The Tuberose, with her silvery light,\r\n      That in the gardens of Malay\r\n    Is called the mistress of the night,\r\n    So like a bride, scented and bright,\r\n      She comes out when the sun’s away.\r\n\r\n    _Moore._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    If all the world and love were young,\r\n    And truth in every shepherd’s tongue,\r\n    These pleasures might my passions move,\r\n    To live with thee and be thy love.\r\n    So fading flowers in every field,\r\n    To winter floods their treasures yield;\r\n    A honeyed tongue, a heart of gall,\r\n    Is fancy’s spring, but sorrow’s fall.\r\n\r\n    _Sir Walter Raleigh._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                Instability and change are written\r\n    On us and all our works. The loveliest things,\r\n      When full of promise, oftentimes are smitten;\r\n    And sweetest roses foster hidden stings.\r\n      The world, if loved too well, doth ever pall,\r\n    And the poor fool who set his heart thereon\r\n      Is doomed to see his hope in ruins fall,\r\n    Its frail foundation undermined and gone.\r\n\r\n    _MacKellar._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDAHLIA.... _Elegance and Dignity_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dahlia is a native of South America, but is now extensively\r\ncultivated in Europe and North America. The shrub grows to a\r\nconsiderable height, and the flowers are large and beautiful. The most\r\ncommon colours are crimson and purple. No more appropriate emblem of\r\nelegance and dignity of carriage could have been selected. These\r\nqualities strike us at the first view of the Dahlia.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I loved thee for thy high-born grace,\r\n      Thy deep and lustrous eye--\r\n    For the sweet meaning of thy brow,\r\n      And for thy bearing high.\r\n    I loved thee for thy stainless truth,\r\n      Thy thirst for higher things,\r\n    For all that to our common lot\r\n      A better temper brings.\r\n    And are they not all thine--still thine?\r\n      Is not thy heart as true?\r\n    Holds not thy step its noble grace?\r\n      Thy cheek its dainty hue?\r\n    And have I not an ear to hear?\r\n      And a cloudless eye to see--\r\n    And a thirst for beautiful human thought,\r\n      That first was stirred by thee?\r\n\r\n    _Willis._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Why, a stranger--when he sees her,\r\n    In the street even smileth stilly,\r\n    Just as you would at a lily.\r\n\r\n    _Miss Barrett._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Her grace of motion and of look, the smooth\r\n    And swimming majesty of step and tread,\r\n    The symmetry of form and feature, set\r\n    The soul afloat, even like delicious airs\r\n    Of flute and harp.\r\n\r\n    _Milman._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Her glossy hair was clustered o’er a brow\r\n    Bright with intelligence, and fair and smooth;\r\n    Her eyebrow’s shape was like the aërial bow,\r\n    Her cheek all purple with the beam of youth,\r\n    Mounting, at times, to a transparent glow,\r\n    As if her veins ran lightning.\r\n\r\n    _Byron._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Do but look on her eyes! they do light\r\n      All that love’s world compriseth;\r\n    Do but look on her hair! it is bright\r\n      As love’s star, when it riseth!\r\n    Do but mark,--her forehead’s smoother\r\n    Than words that soothe her!\r\n    And from her arched brows such a grace\r\n    Sheds itself through the face,\r\n    As alone there triumphs to the life,\r\n    All the gain, all the good, of the element’s strife.\r\n\r\n    _Jonson._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMELLIA JAPONICA.... _Modest Merit_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Camellia Japonica is a native of China and Japan. It is a large,\r\nevergreen tree. The flowers are large, of the form of a rose of\r\nvariegated hues--the red prevailing--and without fragrance. It is made\r\nthe emblem of modest worth, because, as Roscoe observes, “it boasts no\r\nfragrance, and conceals no thorn.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Let other bards of angels sing,\r\n      Bright suns without a spot;\r\n    But thou art no such perfect thing,\r\n      Rejoice that thou art not.\r\n    True beauty dwells in deep retreats,\r\n      Whose veil is unremoved;\r\n    Till heart with heart in concord beats,\r\n      And the lover is beloved.\r\n\r\n    _Wordsworth._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Oh, that estates, degrees, and offices,\r\n    Were not derived corruptly! and that dear honour\r\n    Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!\r\n    How many then should cover, that stand bare?\r\n    How many be commanded, that command?\r\n    How much low peasantry would then be gleaned\r\n    From the true seed of honour? and how much honour\r\n    Picked from the chaff and ruin of the times,\r\n    To be new varnished?\r\n\r\n    _Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    There’s a proud modesty in merit!\r\n    Averse from asking, and resolved to pay\r\n    Ten times the gift it asks.\r\n\r\n    _Dryden._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Oh, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,\r\n    To lock it in the wards of covert bosom;\r\n    When it deserves with characters of brass\r\n    A forted residence ’gainst the tooth of time,\r\n    And razure of oblivion.\r\n\r\n    _Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Thine is a mind of maiden artlessness!\r\n      Unstained, undarkened, by the dross of earth;\r\n    A soul, that through thine eyes, bright beams express\r\n      Thy nature, e’en as noble as thy birth;\r\n    Whose every glance reflects the gem enshrined,\r\n    Worthy a form so fair; the diamond of the mind.\r\n\r\n    _Anon._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n            His resting-place is noted by a stone\r\n    Of whitest marble: truthful words are those\r\n    Inscribed thereon. The scene of his repose\r\n    Befits his life: ’twas beautiful and calm.\r\n    In meekness and in love he went his way,\r\n    Uprightly walking--filling up the day\r\n    With useful deeds. He often poured the balm\r\n    Of healing into wounded breasts; nor sought\r\n    The praise of men in doing good.\r\n\r\n    _MacKellar._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHORN-APPLE.... _Deceitful Charms_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flowers of the Thorn-Apple droop while the sun shines beneath their\r\ndull-looking foliage, but on the approach of night, they revive, display\r\ntheir charms, and unfold their prodigious bells, which nature has\r\ncoloured with purple, lined with ivory; and to which she has given an\r\nodour that attracts and intoxicates, but is so dangerous as to stupify\r\nthose who inhale it even in the open air. It is a dangerous plant to be\r\nallowed to grow where children go, as the beauty of its flowers and\r\nfruit is liable to tempt them to their destruction; since it possesses\r\nso poisonous a quality as to produce paralysis, and even madness, in\r\nthose who have eaten it. Its leaves have been recommended for coughs and\r\nasthma. The charms of the Thorn-Apple flower are beautiful, but deadly;\r\nlike those of the corrupt and treacherous, to be found in every society.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    But pleasures are like poppies spread,\r\n    You seize the flower, its bloom is shed;\r\n    Or like the snow-falls in the river,\r\n    A moment white--then melts for ever;\r\n    Or like the borealis race,\r\n    That flit ere you can point their place;\r\n    Or like the rainbow’s lovely form\r\n    Envanishing amid the storm.\r\n\r\n    _Burns._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!\r\n    Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?\r\n\r\n    _Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                    Get thee glass eyes;\r\n    And like a scurvy politician, seem\r\n    To see the things thou dost not.\r\n\r\n    _Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      Women of kind have conditions three:\r\n        The first is,--they be full of deceit,\r\n      To spinne also is their property,\r\n        And women have a wonderful conceit,\r\n      For they can weep oft, and all is a sleight,\r\n    And ever when they list, a tear is in the eye,\r\n    Beware, therefore,--the blind eateth many a fly.\r\n\r\n    _Chaucer._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Ah, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,\r\n    And with a virtuous visor hide deep vice!\r\n\r\n    _Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Smooth runs the water, where the brook is deep;\r\n    And in his simple show he harbours treason.\r\n    The fox barks not, when he would steal the lamb.\r\n    No, no, my sovereign; Gloster is a man\r\n    Unsounded yet, and full of deep deceit.\r\n\r\n    _Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLADY’S SLIPPER.... _Capricious Beauty_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lady’s Slipper is well known in Europe and America. The plant is\r\nsmall, but produces a considerable number of flowers, of variegated\r\nhues. This flower is made the emblem of capricious beauty, because she\r\nseems,\r\n\r\n                ----With her changeful hues,\r\n    As she were doubtful which array to choose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I saw thee in the gay saloon\r\n      Of Fashion’s glittering mart,\r\n    Where Mammon buys what Love deplores,\r\n      Where Nature yields to Art;\r\n    And thou wert so unlike the herd\r\n      My kindling heart despised,\r\n    I could not choose but yield that heart,\r\n      Though Love were sacrificed.\r\n    The smile which hung upon thy lips,\r\n      In transport with their tone,\r\n    The music of thy thoughts, which breathed\r\n      A magic theirs alone!\r\n    The looks which spake a soul so pure,\r\n      So innocent and gay,\r\n    Have passed, like other golden hopes\r\n      Of happiness, away.\r\n\r\n    _Dawes._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                  Her eyes\r\n    Are blue and beautiful, and flash out gleams\r\n    Of diamond light, like that which brightly beams\r\n    On stilly summer nights from starlit skies.\r\n    Her cheeks are tinted with the blushing dyes\r\n    Which Heaven--so wisely bountiful--bestows\r\n    In virgin freshness on the modest rose.\r\n\r\n    _MacKellar._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Most fair is e’er most fickle. A fair girl\r\n    Is like a thousand beauteous things of earth,\r\n    But most like them in love of change.\r\n\r\n    _Peerbold._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    We gaze and turn away, and know not where,\r\n    Dazzled and drunk with beauty, till the heart\r\n    Reels with its fulness.\r\n\r\n    _Byron._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                            Beauty gives\r\n    The features perfectness, and to the form\r\n    Its delicate proportions: she may stain\r\n    The eye with a celestial blue--the cheek\r\n    With carmine of the sunset; she may breathe\r\n    Grace into every motion, like the play\r\n    Of the least visible tissue of a cloud:\r\n    She may give all that is within her own\r\n    Bright cestus--and one glance of intellect,\r\n    Like stronger magic, will outshine it all.\r\n\r\n    _Willis._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALTHEA.... _Consumed by Love_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name and signification of the Althea is derived from the Grecian\r\nfable of Althea and her son, who lost his life in consequence of his\r\nlove for the beautiful Atalanta. His consuming away as the fatal brand\r\nwas burning, suggested the emblem of consumed by love. The Althea is a\r\nshrub from five to seven feet in height, and is a native of the East\r\nIndies. The flowers are about the size of the common rose, and either of\r\na white or pink hue.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    There is an all-consuming passion here;\r\n    But ’tis a vestal flame, which worships thee!\r\n\r\n    _Anon._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                            Like Ixion,\r\n    I look on Juno, feel my heart turn to cinders\r\n    With an invisible fire; and yet should she\r\n    Deign to appear clothed in a various cloud,\r\n    The majesty of the substance is so sacred\r\n    I durst not clasp the shadow. I behold her\r\n    With adoration, feast my eye, while all\r\n    My other senses starve; and oft, frequenting\r\n    The place which she makes happy with her presence,\r\n    I never yet had power, with tongue or pen,\r\n    To move her to compassion, or make known\r\n    What ’tis I languish for; yet I must gaze still,\r\n    Though it increase my flame.\r\n\r\n    _Massinger._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    With thee conversing, I forget all time;\r\n    All seasons and their change, all please alike.\r\n\r\n    _Milton._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Love is a region full of fires,\r\n    And burning with extreme desires;\r\n    An object seeks, of which possest,\r\n    The wheels are still, the motions rest,\r\n    The flames in ashes lie opprest;\r\n    The meteor, striving high to rise,\r\n    The fuel spent, falls down and dies.\r\n\r\n    _Beaumont._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    What scenes appear where’er I turn my view!\r\n    The dear ideas, where’er I fly, pursue,\r\n    Rise in the grave, before the altar rise,\r\n    Stain all my soul, and wanton in my eyes.\r\n    I waste the matin lamp in sighs for thee,\r\n    Thy image steals between my God and me;\r\n    Thy voice I seem in every hymn to hear,\r\n    With every bead I drop too soft a tear.\r\n    When from the censer clouds of fragrance roll,\r\n    And swelling organs lift the rising soul,\r\n    One thought of thee puts all the pomp to flight,\r\n    Priests, tapers, temples, swim before my sight:\r\n    In seas of flame my plunging soul is drowned,\r\n    While altars blaze, and angels tremble round.\r\n\r\n    _Pope._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLARKSPUR.... _Flights of Fancy_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLarkspur, Lark’s-claw, Lark-heels, and Lark’s-toe have been given in\r\nallusion to the long spur-like nectary, which has been whimsically\r\nsupposed to represent these things, and many more. The Latin name,\r\n_Delphinium_, is from the Greek, Dolphin, because the nectary was\r\nthought like that fish. The French call it _Dauphinelle_, _pied\r\nd’alouette_, _l’épéron de chevalier_, (knight’s spur;) and the Italian,\r\n_speronella_, (little spur,) _sperone di cavaliere_, (knight’s spur,)\r\nand _fior regio_, (king-flower.) These names give quite a chivalric\r\nimportance to the gentle flower, and furnish abundant subject for\r\nthought and fancy. Our own rural names give us a picture of the\r\nsky-lark; that “musical cherub,” soaring far and high into the blue\r\nsummer heaven, above the lonely mountain-top, or over the busy town, and\r\nwe can recall the delight of listening to his sweet melody.\r\n\r\n_Louisa A. Twamley._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    For never yet was bosom found\r\n    So dull of sense to music’s sound,\r\n    As not to linger on the way,\r\n    And list to his ascending lay,\r\n    And upward gaze with straining sight,\r\n    And see him melting into light;\r\n    Till the eye fail its part to bear\r\n    In concert with the hearing ear;\r\n    And naught remain but what may seem\r\n    Imagination’s fairy dream,\r\n    Or the sweet strain, if such there were,\r\n    Of Prospero’s spirit in the air.\r\n    Oh, for that strength of voice and wing\r\n    To sing and soar, to soar and sing;\r\n    With all his joyousness of heart\r\n    From earth’s encumbrances apart;\r\n    And with heaven’s denizens on high\r\n    To revel mid the calm clear sky!\r\n\r\n    _Mant._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n          Fancy is a fairy, that can hear,\r\n    Ever, the melody of nature’s voice,\r\n    And see all lovely visions that she will.\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. Osgood._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n          All impediments in fancy’s course\r\n    Are motives of more fancy.\r\n\r\n    Shakspeare.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Ever let the fancy roam,\r\n    Pleasure never is at home;\r\n    Then let winged Fancy wander\r\n    Through the thoughts still spread beyond her:\r\n    Oh, sweet Fancy! let her loose,\r\n    Every thing is spoilt by use.\r\n\r\n    _Kent._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDYER’S WEED.... _Relief_.\r\n\r\n\r\nDyer’s Weed is like a very large upright plant of Mignonette, to which\r\nsweet exotic it is nearly related, both being members of the _reseda_\r\nfamily. The _Reseda odorata_, or Mignonette, is a native of Egypt, and\r\nwas introduced into England in 1752. The word _reseda_ is from _resedo_,\r\nto calm, to appease. The plants were thought useful applications to\r\nexternal bruises, to ease pain. There are two species growing wild in\r\nEngland. _Reseda lutea_, or Base-rocket, likes a chalky soil, but _R.\r\nluteola_, the Dyer’s Weed, is often found on waste ground everywhere. It\r\nis much used by dyers, particularly in France. It affords a most\r\nbeautiful yellow dye, for cotton, woollen, mohair, silk, and linen. Blue\r\ncloths dipped in a decoction of it become green. The entire plant, when\r\nabout to flower, is pulled up, and employed both fresh and dried. Like\r\nthe Coltsfoot, this plant is among the first which spring from the\r\nrubbish thrown out of coal-pits. Linnæus observed, that the nodding\r\nspike of flowers always follows the sun, even on a cloudy day, pointing\r\neastward in a morning, southward at noon, westward in the afternoon, and\r\nnorthward at night. If this be true, it may supplant the sunflower in\r\nthe favour of sentimental florists, for the inconstancy of that has long\r\nbeen proved. Good old Gerarde, who evidently did his best to believe all\r\nthings, says, that he has seen four sunflowers on one stem, pointing to\r\nthe four cardinal points. I am wandering from my subject, but must\r\nremind you of some sweet lines by that poet of nature--Clare, where he\r\ngroups the sunflower so nicely; and you may look at that cottage, where\r\nthe children are playing, and see the picture nearly realized:\r\n\r\n    Where rustic taste at leisure trimly weaves\r\n    The rose and straggling woodbine to the eaves,\r\n    And on the crowded spot that pales enclose\r\n    The white and scarlet daisy rears in rows,\r\n    Training the trailing peas in clusters neat,\r\n    Perfuming evening with a luscious sweet,\r\n    And sun-flowers planting for their gilded show,\r\n    That scale the window’s lattice ere they blow,\r\n    And, sweet to habitants within the sheds,\r\n    Peep through the crystal panes their golden heads.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    A gentle peace, like evening winds\r\n      In summer from the ocean’s breast,\r\n    Moved o’er my sighing, sinking soul,\r\n      And soothed my murmuring griefs to rest;\r\n    And through the weary night of pain,\r\n      When it were manliness to weep,\r\n    My soul was comforted by this--\r\n      “He giveth his beloved sleep.”\r\n\r\n    _MacKellar._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNASTURTION.... _Patriotism_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nasturtion is a native of Europe and the East. The flowers are of a\r\nvery brilliant golden yellow, and present a beautiful appearance. The\r\nplant is said to emit flashes of light in the morning before sunrise,\r\nand also at twilight.

It is a frequent saying,\r\nthat Truth lies at the bottom of a well, and that she always mingles\r\nsome bitterness with her sweet blessings; and we have chosen for her\r\nemblem a plant which, like her, delights in the shade, and is evergreen.\r\nThe Nightshade is the only plant in England which loses and reproduces\r\nits leaves twice a year.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *

  I’d written long, and eyes and head\r\n      And fingers ’gan to tire.\r\n\r\n    I rose to shut my desk, and go--\r\n      Quite weary--half asleep--\r\n    A book fell open as I moved;\r\n      E’en sleepy eyes must peep;\r\n\r\n    And, pictured on its page, I saw\r\n      The portrait of a friend,\r\n    Whose smiling face bade my dull thoughts\r\n      To happy memories wend.\r\n\r\n    It was the tall, sweet-scented Flag,\r\n      Lay pictured there so true,\r\n    I could have deemed some fairy hand\r\n      The faithful image drew.\r\n\r\n    The falchion-leaves, all long and sharp;\r\n      The stem, like a tall leaf too,\r\n    Except where, halfway up its side,\r\n      A cone-shaped flower-spike grew,\r\n\r\n    Like a lady’s finger, taper, long,\r\n      From end to end arrayed\r\n    In close scale-armour, that was all\r\n      Of starry flowers made.\r\n\r\n    If you could fancy fairy folk\r\n      Would mimic works of ours,\r\n    You’d think their dainty fingers here\r\n      Had wrought mosaic flowers.\r\n\r\n    The tiny petals, neatly formed,\r\n      With geometric skill,\r\n    Are each one so exactly shaped,\r\n      Its proper place to fill.\r\n\r\n    And stamens, like fine golden dust,\r\n      Spangle the flowerets green;\r\n    Aught more compact and beautiful,\r\n      Mine eyes have never seen!\r\n\r\n    How well I know when first I met\r\n      The Sweet Flag’s graceful form;\r\n    ’Twas on a glowing summer’s day,\r\n      Mid hearts as bright and warm.\r\n\r\n    Mid hearts as warm as sunny gleams,\r\n      And eyes as kind and bright,\r\n    And spirits that, like sunshine too,\r\n      Are cheering, loved, and light.\r\n\r\n    We gathered there the Acorus\r\n      From Claremont’s quiet lake;\r\n    And home with me, full many a mile,\r\n      I did the pale flower take.\r\n\r\n    ’Twas new to me, but yet is not\r\n      So very scarce and rare,\r\n    As many a river knoweth well;\r\n      None better than the Yare!\r\n\r\n    For by its banks abundantly\r\n      The fragrant tall leaves grow;\r\n    Singing with reedy rustling voice,\r\n      Whene’er soft breezes blow.\r\n\r\n    The Mayor of Norwich holds in June\r\n      His annual feast and show;\r\n    And to the grand cathedral church\r\n      Processions with him go.\r\n\r\n    And then the gray and solemn aisles,\r\n      And all the ancient floor,\r\n    Are with the aromatic leaves\r\n      Bestrewèd thickly o’er.\r\n\r\n    In by-gone days the costly fumes\r\n      Of incense here were shed;\r\n    But sweeter far the fragrant gush\r\n      That greets each passing tread.\r\n\r\n    In the sordid streets are bowers built,\r\n      Of these same reeds as well,\r\n    Plaited and wrought like basket-work,\r\n      All full of spicy smell.\r\n\r\n    And many a queer and quaint device\r\n      Are round about them made,\r\n    Of the gold and red ranunculus,\r\n      In varied shape and shade.\r\n\r\n    Oh! many a young and guileless heart\r\n      Is blithe as blithe can be,\r\n    To walk through Norwich streets that morn,\r\n      The decked out bowers to see.\r\n\r\n    In far gone times, ere folks had grown\r\n      So mighty nice and clever--\r\n    When carpets were unheard-of things,\r\n      And druggets dreamed of never--\r\n\r\n    When wide bare floors of good hard mud\r\n      Or stone, not over even,\r\n    Were all that unto knightly strides,\r\n      Or dames’ light steps, were given--\r\n\r\n    When common rushes strewed the halls\r\n      Where royal banquets were--\r\n    How precious must these reeds have been\r\n      Beside the banks of Yare!\r\n\r\n    I can fancy high and dainty dames\r\n      Sending stout serving-men\r\n    To gather store of these sweet Flags,\r\n      From river, pool, and fen.\r\n\r\n    Perhaps to strew a lady’s bower,\r\n      Perhaps the castle hall,\r\n    Where warlike lords and knights should meet\r\n      At stately festival.\r\n\r\n    How often in the chapel too,\r\n      The fresh-thrown reeds might lie;\r\n    While the tears and smiles of a bridal band\r\n      Went softly passing by!\r\n\r\n    And they were there when sorrow deep\r\n      Wept the untimely doom\r\n    Of young, and bright, and beautiful,\r\n      Borne to the ancestral tomb.\r\n\r\n    In sooth it is an ancient thing,\r\n      This new-found friend of mine,\r\n    And many a scene of joy and wo\r\n      Hath it known in days lang syne.\r\n\r\n    I love it for them all right well,\r\n      But yet I love it more\r\n    For the fairy scene that lay around\r\n      Its home on that lakeless shore:\r\n\r\n    Beside the bank the stately trees\r\n      Waved gently to and fro,\r\n    And flitting specks of sunlight fell\r\n      The leafy branches thro’,\r\n\r\n    And danced among the tall keen reeds,\r\n      And on the water fell,\r\n    Where the merry fish were glancing swift;\r\n      And the water snake, as well,\r\n\r\n    Came, gliding in a graceful curl\r\n      All silently and still,\r\n    Like a lord in his own dominions there,\r\n      Swimming about at will.\r\n\r\n    Now toward the margin where we stood\r\n      We saw him steering on,--\r\n    Then under groups of lily leaves\r\n      The happy thing was gone.\r\n\r\n    And wild-fowl, water-rats, and all,\r\n      Lived in that little lake;\r\n    Oh, what a pleasant picture now\r\n      My thoughts of it awake!\r\n\r\n    Its margent of smooth lawny turf\r\n      Was mossy, soft, and deep,\r\n    Where the shadows broad of the beech and oak\r\n      Seemed quietly to sleep.\r\n\r\n    The rhododendrons, purple yet\r\n      With many a massive wreath,\r\n    Had seedling plants, a countless host,\r\n      Crowding the turf beneath.\r\n\r\n    I dearly love small relics brought\r\n      From spots where I have been,\r\n    That seem to certify the facts\r\n      Of memory’s pictured scene;\r\n\r\n    But seeds and roots of flowers are\r\n      The pleasantest of all;--\r\n    I’ve Broom-seeds from a heathy glen,\r\n      And ferns from an old stone wall.\r\n\r\n    Of wall-flower slips and roots I’ve got\r\n      So many, that I’m fain,\r\n    Dear as they are to me, to turn\r\n      Many adrift again.\r\n\r\n    My ivy-plant from Tintern’s braved\r\n      Four winters’ stormy weather;\r\n    I’ve scraps, too, from proud Kenilworth,\r\n      And here they grow together.\r\n\r\n    The feathery seeds of clematis\r\n      In Goodrich I have caught;\r\n    Hartstongue from Ragland’s lofty keep,\r\n      With maiden-hair, I brought.\r\n\r\n    And so at Claremont, where the crowd\r\n      Of rhododendrons grew,\r\n    My whims were humoured, and I now\r\n      Am rearing one or two.\r\n\r\n    And e’en those little things can bring\r\n      Before me, passing well,\r\n    The very nook where the scented leaves\r\n      Of the graceful calamus dwell.\r\n\r\n    _Louisa A. Twamley._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBROOM.... _Humility_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThomas Miller thus speaks of the “bonny Broom,” in his Romance of\r\nNature:--\r\n\r\nBeautiful art thou, O Broom! waving in all thy rich array of green and\r\ngold, on the breezy bosom of the bee-haunted heath. The sleeping\r\nsunshine, and the silver-footed showers, the clouds that for ever play\r\nabout the face of Heaven, the homeless winds, and the crystal-globed\r\ndews, that settle upon thy blossoms like sleep on the veined eyelids of\r\nan infant, are ever beating above and around thee, as if to tell that\r\nthey rejoice in thy companionship, and that, although a thousand years\r\nhave strided by with silent steps, time hath not abated an atom of their\r\nlove. Who can tell the thoughts of Saxon Alfred when, wandering alone,\r\ncrownless and sceptreless, he stretched himself on the lonely moor\r\nbeneath the shadow of thy golden blossoms, sighing for the fair queen he\r\nhad left far behind? When he bowed his kingly head, and, musing on thy\r\nbeauty, buried in a solitary wild, thought how even regal dignity would\r\nbe enhanced by humility, and that, although thou didst grow there\r\nunmarked and unpruned, not a more princely flower waved in his own\r\nEnglish garden.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Humility, that low, sweet root,\r\n    From which all heavenly virtues shoot.\r\n\r\n    _Moore._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Oh the Broom, the bonny bonny Broom,\r\n      The Broom of the Cowden-knowes;\r\n    For sure so soft, so sweet a bloom,\r\n      Elsewhere there never grows.\r\n\r\n    _Scottish Song._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Here is a precious jewel I have found\r\n    Among the filth and rubbish of the world.\r\n    I’ll stoop for it, but when I wear it here,\r\n    Set on my forehead like the morning-star,\r\n    The world may wonder, but it will not laugh.\r\n\r\n    _Longfellow._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Their groves of sweet myrtle, let foreign lands reckon,\r\n      Where bright beaming summers exalt the perfume;\r\n    Far dearer to me yon lone glen o’ green breckan,\r\n      Wi’ the burn stealing under the lang yellow Broom.\r\n\r\n    _Burns._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    But the publican stood afar off in his grief,\r\n    For he felt like a beggar who needed relief;\r\n    And he raised not his eyes, and he saw not the scorn\r\n    Which the lip of the Pharisee proudly had worn.\r\n    But he smote on his bosom, and deeply he sighed;\r\n    As a sinner, for mercy, sweet mercy, he cried.\r\n    It was all he could utter, but GOD hears a sigh,\r\n    And listens, no matter how feeble the cry.\r\n    Both unheard and unblest, the proud Pharisee then\r\n    Returned to the pomp of his riches again;\r\n    While the publican sinner, though loathed and oppressed,\r\n    Went joyfully homeward with peace in his breast.\r\n\r\n    _MacKellar._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nST.

Whenever the Romans sent their heralds to offer\r\npeace or war to nations, one of them always carried a sprig of Vervain.\r\nThe Druids, both in Gaul and Britain, regarded the Vervain with the same\r\nveneration as the misletoe, and offered sacrifices to the earth before\r\nthey cut this plant in spring, which was a ceremony of great pomp.\r\nThough the Druids and their religion have passed away, the Vervain is\r\nstill the plant of spells and enchantment. In the northern provinces of\r\nFrance, the shepherds gather it with ceremonies and words known only to\r\nthemselves, and express its juices under certain phases of the moon.\r\nThey insist that this plant enables them to cure their ailments, and to\r\ncast a spell on their daughters and cattle, by which they can make them\r\nconform to their wishes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I’d wake the spell that sleeps within an herb,\r\n    And witch the lady till I know she’s mine.\r\n\r\n    _Peerbold._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Her overpowering presence made you feel\r\n    It would not be idolatry to kneel.\r\n\r\n    _Byron._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Her sacred beauty hath enchanted heaven,\r\n    And, had she lived before the siege of Troy,\r\n    Helen, whose beauty summoned Greece to arms,\r\n    And drew a thousand ships to Tenedos,\r\n    Had not been named in Homer’s Iliad;\r\n    Her name had been in every line he wrote.\r\n\r\n    _Marlowe._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Not all the charms that superstition gave\r\n      To plants in lonely forests found,\r\n    Could work such magic in Love’s doting slave,\r\n      As the voice which his wishes crowned.\r\n\r\n    _Anon._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    A voice of laughter--a voice of glee!\r\n    Among the maidens, who happy as she?\r\n    By love’s enchantment her thrilling breast\r\n    Is wildly, witchingly, over-blest:\r\n    And gushing joys, like the sun in May,\r\n    Enliven the noon of her bridal-day.\r\n\r\n    _MacKellar._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Mysterious plant! whose golden tresses wave\r\n    With a sad beauty in the dying year,\r\n    Blooming amid November’s frost severe,\r\n    Like a pale corpse-light o’er the recent grave.\r\n    If shepherds tell us true, thy wand hath power,\r\n    With gracious influence, to avert the harm\r\n    Of ominous planets.\r\n\r\n    _Token, 1831._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCORN.... _Riches_.\r\n\r\n\r\nCeres, the goddess of Corn and harvest, was represented with a garland\r\nof ears of Corn on her head. The commemoration of the loss of her\r\ndaughter Proserpine, was celebrated about the beginning of harvest; that\r\nof her search after her, at the time of sowing Corn. A whole straw has\r\nbeen made the emblem of union; and a broken straw, of rupture. The\r\ncustom of breaking a straw, to express the rupture of a contract, may be\r\ntraced back to an early period of French history, and may be said to\r\nhave had a royal origin. When Charles the Simple, of France, was\r\nabandoned by his principal lords, they broke a straw to express that\r\nthey would no longer acknowledge him as their king. Corn may be regarded\r\nas an appropriate emblem of wealth; since, wherever it grows, it leads\r\nus to infer plenty and comfort.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Therefore, if at great things thou wouldst arrive,\r\n    Get riches first, get wealth.\r\n\r\n    _Milton._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Then let us get money, like bees lay up honey;\r\n      We’ll build us new hives and store each cell;\r\n    The sight of our treasure shall yield us great pleasure,\r\n      We’ll count it, and chink it, and jingle it well.\r\n\r\n    _Dr. Franklin._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Much learning shows how little mortals know;\r\n    Much wealth, how little worldlings can enjoy:\r\n    At best, it babies us with endless toys,\r\n    And keeps us children till we drop to dust.\r\n    As monkeys at a mirror stand amazed,\r\n    They fail to find what they so plainly see;\r\n    Thus men, in shining riches, see the face\r\n    Of happiness, nor know it as a shade;\r\n    But gaze, and touch, and peep, and peep again,\r\n    And wish, and wonder it is absent still.\r\n\r\n    _Young._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                            Oh, blessed lot\r\n    To be possessed of wealth and of a heart\r\n    So heavenly made that it refuses not\r\n    Of its abundance freely to impart!\r\n\r\n    _MacKellar._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                            You are heir\r\n    To lordships, mansions, forests, parks, and gems.\r\n    You have three mighty manors in Castile;\r\n    Two broad estates in Leon; two amidst\r\n    The mulberry trees of Murcia, and huge chests\r\n    Crammed full of ingots, dug by naked slaves,\r\n    Who famished on coarse bread.

It was sacred to Bacchus, who is represented crowned with Ivy\r\nleaves, as well as those of the vine. It formed the crown of the Greek\r\nand Roman poets; and, in modern times, has been made the poet’s frequent\r\nimage of constancy. The Ivy is attached to the earth by its own roots,\r\nand derives no nourishment from the substances to which it clings. The\r\nprotector of ruins, it adorns the dilapidated walls which it holds\r\ntogether; it will not accept every kind of support, but its attachment\r\nends only with its life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    When all things have their trial, you shall find\r\n    Nothing is constant but a virtuous mind.\r\n\r\n    _Shirley._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                        The mountain rill\r\n    Seeks with no surer flow the far, bright sea,\r\n    Than my unchanged affections flow to thee.\r\n\r\n    _Park Benjamin._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I am constant as the northern star;\r\n    Of whose true, fixed, and resting quality\r\n    There is no fellow in the firmament.\r\n\r\n    _Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                       Make my breast\r\n    Transparent as pure crystal, that the world,\r\n    Jealous of me, may see the foulest thought\r\n    My heart does hold.

It is an ornament to the woods,\r\nstripped bare by the rude breath of winter; its berries serve for food\r\nfor the little birds that never leave us, and its foliage affords them\r\nan hospitable shelter during the cold season. Nature, by a seeming\r\nforethought, has been careful to preserve the verdure of this handsome\r\ntree all the year round, and to arm it with thorns, that it may furnish\r\nboth food and protection to the innocent creatures which resort to it\r\nfor shelter. It may be added, however, that from the bark of the common\r\nHolly, when fermented and washed from the woody fibres, is made the\r\nbird-lime which is used for catching small birds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    With Holly and ivy,\r\n      So green and so gay,\r\n    We deck up our houses\r\n      As fresh as the day;\r\n    With bays and rosemary,\r\n      And laurel complete,\r\n    And every one now\r\n      Is a king in conceit.\r\n\r\n    _Poor Robin’s Almanac, 1695._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    THE HOLLY TREE.\r\n\r\n    O Reader! hast thou ever stood to see\r\n          The Holly tree?\r\n    The eye that contemplates it well perceives\r\n          Its glossy leaves,\r\n    Ordered by an intelligence so wise\r\n    As might confound the atheist’s sophistries.\r\n\r\n    Below, a circling fence its leaves are seen,\r\n          Wrinkled and keen;\r\n    No grazing cattle, through their prickly round\r\n          Can reach to wound;\r\n    But as they grow where nothing is to fear,\r\n    Smooth and unarmed the pointless leaves appear.\r\n\r\n    I love to view these things with curious eyes\r\n          And moralize;\r\n    And in this wisdom of the Holly tree\r\n          Can emblems see,\r\n    Wherewith, perchance, to make a pleasant rhyme,\r\n    One which may profit in the after-time.\r\n\r\n    Thus, though abroad, perchance I might appear\r\n          Harsh and austere,\r\n    To those who on my leisure would intrude\r\n          Reserved and rude,\r\n    Gentle at home amid my friends I’d be,\r\n    Like the high leaves upon the Holly tree.\r\n\r\n    And should my youth, as youth is apt, I know,\r\n          Some harshness show,\r\n    All vain asperities I day by day\r\n          Would wear away,\r\n    Till the smooth temper of my age should be\r\n    Like the high leaves upon the Holly tree.\r\n\r\n    And as when all the summer trees are seen\r\n          So bright and green,\r\n    The Holly leaves a sober hue display,\r\n          Less bright than they;\r\n    But when the bare and wintry woods we see,\r\n    What then so cheerful as the Holly tree?\r\n\r\n    So serious should my youth appear among\r\n          The thoughtless throng,\r\n    So would I seem amid the young and gay\r\n          More grave than they,\r\n    That in my age as cheerful I might be\r\n    As the green winter of the Holly tree.\r\n\r\n    _Southey._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    To know the road ere on’t we trust the foot,\r\n    And where it leads, and what, while journeying,\r\n    We may meet, is Wisdom’s eager wish.\r\n\r\n    _Peerbold._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                Walk\r\n    Boldly and wisely in that light thou hast;\r\n    There is a hand above will help thee on.\r\n\r\n    _Bailey._\r\n\r\nMEADOW SAFFRON.... _My best days are past_.\r\n\r\nThe Meadow Saffron, or Colchicum Autumnale, springs up about the time\r\nthe leaves begin to fall from the trees, and may, therefore, be said to\r\nproclaim to all nature, that the bright days of summer are past.\r\nAccording to Ovid, this autumnal flower owes its origin to some drops of\r\nthe magic liquor prepared by Medea, to restore the aged Æson to the\r\nbloom and vigour of youth, which were spilled in the fields. As a\r\nmedicine, the Colchicum is powerful, but dangerous, and must be used\r\nwith caution. The poisonous quality of the plant seems to be known, as\r\nif by instinct, to all kinds of cattle. They all shun it, and in many\r\npastures this alone will be found standing, when all other herbage has\r\nbeen consumed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Why grieve that time has brought so soon\r\n      The sober age of manhood on?\r\n    As idly should I weep at noon\r\n      To see the blush of morning gone.\r\n    True, time will sear and blanch my brow:\r\n      Well--I shall sit with aged men,\r\n    And my good glass will tell me how\r\n      A grisly beard becomes me then.\r\n    And should no foul dishonour lie\r\n      Upon my head when I am gray,\r\n    Love yet may search my fading eye,\r\n      And smooth the path of my decay.\r\n\r\n    _Bryant._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SWEET PEA PANSY\r\n\r\n_I depart.

It is like\r\nan afterthought of Flora’s, who smiles at leaving us. The China Aster\r\nwas introduced into Europe by Father d’Insarville, a Jesuit missionary;\r\nwho, about the year 1730, sent seeds of it to the royal gardens of\r\nParis. As, by cultivation, many varieties of the Aster have been\r\nobtained, the flower has been made the emblem of variety.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    The sleepless streams move onward\r\n    Through beds of idling lilies,\r\n    Chiding the foolish flowers\r\n    That watch their mirrored beauty;\r\n    So live the thoughtless many,\r\n    Who throng the halls of fashion.\r\n\r\n    _Dawes._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I love the ever-varying hue\r\n      Upon the face of heaven;\r\n    I would not have it always blue,\r\n      But oft with lightning riven.\r\n    I would not have wide oceans spread\r\n      A mirror e’er to see;\r\n    But lashed to many a cresty head\r\n      By scowling tempests free!\r\n\r\n    _C.

The ancients\r\nconsecrated the shrub to the Furies. The smoke of its green roots was\r\nthe incense which they offered in preference to the infernal gods; and\r\nthey burned its berries during funerals to ban malign influences. In\r\nsome parts of Europe, the peasant still believes that the perfume of\r\nJuniper berries purifies the air, and drives evil spirits from his\r\nhumble cot. The Juniper is made to signify protection, on account of the\r\ndefensive qualities ascribed to it by superstition, and the shelter its\r\ndrooping branches afford to small animals which are hard pressed by the\r\nhunters.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    I have found out a gift for my fair;\r\n      I have found where the wood-pigeons breed;\r\n    But let me that plunder forbear,\r\n      She will say, ’twas a barbarous deed.\r\n\r\n    “For he ne’er could be true,” she averred,\r\n      “Who could rob a poor bird of its young;”\r\n    And I loved her the more, when I heard\r\n      Such tenderness fall from her tongue.\r\n\r\n    _Shenstone._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAZEL.... _Peace--Reconciliation_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFable gives the following account of the origin of the signification of\r\nthe Hazel. There was a time when men were at constant war with each\r\nother, and could not be restrained from cruelty and revenge by any tie\r\nof kin. The gods at length took pity on them. Apollo and Mercury made\r\npresents to each other, and descended to the earth. The god of harmony\r\nreceived from the son of Maia the shell of a tortoise, out of which he\r\nhad constructed a lyre, and gave him in exchange a Hazel stick, which\r\nhad the power of imparting a love of virtue and of reconciling hearts\r\ndivided by envy and hate. By the power thus given him, Mercury taught\r\nmen the love of peace, and of home and country, and made commerce the\r\nbond of nations. Adorned with two light wings, and entwined with\r\nserpents, the Hazel rod given to the god of eloquence by the god of\r\nharmony is still, by the name of caduceus, the emblem of peace,\r\ncommerce, and reconciliation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Oh then that wisdom may we know,\r\n    Which leads a life of peace below!\r\n\r\n    _Sprague._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Peace, sweet peace is ever found\r\n    In her eternal home on holy ground.\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. Embury._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                          And see,\r\n    As yet unclothed, the Hazel tree\r\n    Prepares his early tufts to lend\r\n    The coppice first-fruits; and depend\r\n    In russet drops, whose clustered rows,\r\n    Still closed in part, in part disclose,\r\n    Yet fenced beneath their scaly shed,\r\n    The pendent anther’s yellow head.\r\n\r\n    _Louisa A.

and gallant trains\r\n      She led through forest ways.\r\n\r\n    ’Twas a merry and a winsome thing,\r\n      When lord, and squire, and knight\r\n    Rode forth, mid bugles ringing shrill,\r\n      With dainty ladies bright,\r\n    To sweep along by vale and hill,\r\n      Or through the forest glade,\r\n    Where the echoes of their laughter light\r\n      A merry music made.\r\n\r\n    And oft they reined their palfreys in\r\n      Beneath the young Oak tree,\r\n    And oft foretold how grand a thing\r\n      In after-time ’twould be.\r\n\r\n    These jocund sports passed all away;\r\n      For direful civil war\r\n    Spread its fell curse throughout the land,\r\n      Wasting it near and far.\r\n\r\n    And the next lord these broad lands had,\r\n      A warrior stern was he,\r\n    He dwelt with camps and cannon more\r\n      Than sylvan glade and tree.\r\n\r\n    He died in battle; and his lands\r\n      By craft and deeds unfair,\r\n    His brother claimed and won, although\r\n      His infant son was heir.\r\n\r\n    This hard, bad man was miserly,\r\n      And loved no thing save gold;\r\n    He soon marked out the stately tree,\r\n      To be cut down and sold.\r\n\r\n    What was its beauty unto him?--\r\n      The grand and noble thing!\r\n    His dull eyes only measured well\r\n      What moneys it would bring.\r\n\r\n    But while he doomed the lordly oak,\r\n      His wicked life ebbed low,\r\n    And suddenly, death summoned him\r\n      From his ill-got hoards to go.\r\n\r\n    The grand estate--the ancient hall,\r\n      The woods, and wealth untold,\r\n    Came then unto that warrior’s child,\r\n      A boy of ten years old.\r\n\r\n    He was a thoughtful, quiet boy,\r\n      For though yet young in years,\r\n    His mother’s sorrows and his own\r\n      Had made him old in tears.\r\n\r\n    And with a calm and gentle joy\r\n      Came home that youthful heir,\r\n    For his chief source of gladness was,\r\n      To bring his mother there:--\r\n\r\n    To watch her sadly smile to see\r\n      Again each well-known spot,\r\n    Where days of happiness had passed,\r\n      That ne’er could be forgot:--\r\n\r\n    To have her former state restored,\r\n      Maidens, and serving-men;\r\n    And garments, richer than of old,\r\n      He bade them bring her then.\r\n\r\n    The gardens, that the miser had\r\n      Left all untrimmed and bare,\r\n    Were planted, pruned, and decked anew,\r\n      And stored with all things rare.\r\n\r\n    But chiefly did the lady love\r\n      One glade within the wood,\r\n    The shady glade, where broad and high,\r\n      The noble Oak tree stood.\r\n\r\n    Sad memories, yet sweet ones too,\r\n      For her that lone spot bore:\r\n    ’Twas there she parted from her lord\r\n      To meet on earth no more!\r\n\r\n    ’Twas there, beneath that tree, he spoke\r\n      His last, _last_ fond farewell!\r\n    From thence she watched him ride away\r\n      The eve before he fell:--\r\n    No marvel that sad lady loved\r\n      The silent spot so well!\r\n\r\n    And there they oft together came,\r\n      The lady and the boy,\r\n    For he to her was all on earth,\r\n      Her one sole living joy.\r\n\r\n    And long years after, when she slept\r\n      Her warrior’s tomb beside,\r\n    When the boy had grown an aged man,\r\n      With grandsons by his side:--\r\n\r\n    That ancient wood he reverenced;\r\n      And peasants, when they spoke\r\n    Of the old tree within the glade,\r\n      Called it--the Lady’s Oak.\r\n\r\n    I know the spot--though strangely time\r\n      Hath altered all around,\r\n    Where once the forest’s stillness lay,\r\n      Now whirling wheels resound.\r\n\r\n    A large and busy peopled town\r\n      E’en on that spot we see,\r\n    Where dappled deer and timid birds\r\n      Dwelt fearlessly and free.\r\n\r\n    But I remember when a child,\r\n      One old and mouldering shell\r\n    Of a most ancient, huge Oak tree\r\n      Stood near the public well.\r\n\r\n    I’ve sat within it many a time,\r\n      In childish sport and play,\r\n    And much I mourned to see at last\r\n      The trunk quite cleared away.\r\n\r\n    Soon they built there a fine new street,\r\n      And noisy coaches sweep\r\n    With roar and riot,--even where\r\n      That lady came to weep!\r\n\r\n    Each passing year we note a change\r\n      In ancient things and new;\r\n    And if we see so much in one,\r\n      What may not hundreds do?\r\n\r\n    _Louisa A.

Its bare trunk, and\r\ndark foliage, with which its fruit, looking like drops of blood, stands\r\nin harsh contrast, excite in us a sort of aversion. Persons who sleep\r\nunder a Yew tree are liable to be seized with dizziness, heaviness, and\r\nviolent headache. Its juice is poisonous, and the tree exhausts the soil\r\nwhich supports it, and destroys all other plants which spring up beneath\r\nit. The Yew was planted in old English burying-grounds, and its wood was\r\ncommonly employed for making bows and arrows before the introduction of\r\nfire-arms. The Greeks, impressed with the melancholy aspect of this\r\ntree, invented the fable of the unhappy Smilax; who, seeing that her\r\nlove was rejected by young Crocus, was transformed into a Yew.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Who that hath ever been,\r\n      Could bear to be no more?\r\n    Yet who would tread again the scene\r\n      He trod through life before?\r\n\r\n    _Montgomery._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast;\r\n    Which thou wilt propagate, to have them prest\r\n    With more of thine: this love, that thou hast shown,\r\n    Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.\r\n\r\n    _Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    And sorrowing friends stood round the bed\r\n      Whereon a form was lying:\r\n    ’Twas Ellen;--there the suffering saint,\r\n    Without a murmur or complaint,\r\n      In peace and hope was dying.\r\n    A silence deep as death was there\r\n      When her true soul departed;\r\n    And grace and mercy crowned her end\r\n      Who lived the broken-hearted.\r\n\r\n    _MacKellar._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    When the cold breath of sorrow is sweeping\r\n      O’er the chords of the youthful heart,\r\n    And the earnest eye, dimmed with strange weeping,\r\n      Sees the visions of fancy depart;\r\n    When the bloom of young feeling is dying,\r\n      And the heart throbs with passion’s fierce strife\r\n    When our sad days are wasted in sighing,\r\n      Who then can find sweetness in life?\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. Embury._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    He is dead.

Withered by the chill breath\r\nof ruthless Winter, the leaves strew the earth; and, in time, mingle\r\nwith the dust, like ourselves.

The proud oak is its slave, and nourishes it with his own\r\nsubstance. The Druids paid a kind of adoration to it, as the emblem of a\r\nweakness that was superior to strength: they regarded the tyrant of the\r\noak as equally formidable to men and gods.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                      ’Tis a common proof,\r\n    That lowliness is young ambition’s ladder,\r\n    Whereto the climber upwards turns his face:\r\n    But when he once attains the upmost round,\r\n    He then unto the ladder turns his back,\r\n    Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees\r\n    By which he did ascend.\r\n\r\n    _Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n      He who ascends to mountain-tops shall find\r\n        The loftiest peaks most wrapt in clouds and snow;\r\n      He who surpasses or subdues mankind\r\n        Must look down on the hate of those below.\r\n      Though high above the sun of glory glow,\r\n        And far beneath the earth and ocean spread,\r\n      Round him are icy rocks, and loudly blow\r\n        Contending tempests on his naked head,\r\n    And thus reward the toils which to those summits led.\r\n\r\n    _Byron._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n            Ye gods, it doth amaze me,\r\n    A man of such a feeble temper should\r\n    So get the start of the majestic world,\r\n    And bear the palm alone.\r\n\r\n    _Shakspeare._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                On the summit see,\r\n    The seals of office glitter in his eyes;\r\n    He climbs,--he pants,--he grasps them.

prayer,\r\n      And for their sire they make a child’s request.\r\n    The times of anguish vainly are not given.\r\n    That lead a family to unity and heaven.\r\n\r\n    _MacKellar._\r\n\r\n

his dark fate one melodious sigh:\r\n    He lived, he died, he sang, in solitude.\r\n    Strangers have wept to hear his passionate notes,\r\n    And virgins, as unknown he past, have sighed\r\n    And wasted for fond love of his wild eyes.\r\n    The fire of those soft orbs has ceased to burn,\r\n    And Silence, too, enamoured of that voice,\r\n    Locks its mute music in her rugged

Heaped in the hollow of the grove, the withered leaves lie dead;\r\n    They rustle to the eddying gust and to the rabbit’s tread.\r\n    The robin and the wren are flown, and from the shrub the jay,\r\n    And from the wood-top calls the crow, through all the gloomy day.\r\n    Where are the flowers, the young fair flowers, that lately sprang and stood,\r\n    In brighter light and softer airs, a beauteous sisterhood?\r\n    Alas! they all are in their graves; the gentle race of flowers\r\n    Are lying in their lonely beds, with the fair and good of ours.\r\n    The rain is falling where they lie: but the cold November rain\r\n    Calls not, from out the gloomy earth, the lovely ones again.\r\n    The wind-flower and the violet, they perished long ago,\r\n    And the wild-rose and the orchis died, amid the summer glow;\r\n    But on the hill the golden-rod, and the aster in the wood,\r\n    And the yellow sunflower by the brook, in autumn beauty stood,\r\n    Till fell the frost from the clear cold heaven, as falls the plague on men,\r\n    And the brightness of their smile was gone, from upland, glade, and glen.\r\n    And now, when comes the calm mild day, as still such days will come,\r\n    To call the squirrel and the bee from out their winter home;\r\n    When the sound of dropping nuts is heard, though all the trees are still,\r\n    And twinkle in the smoky light the waters of the rill,\r\n    The south wind searches for the flowers whose fragrance late he bore,\r\n    And sighs to find them in the wood and by the streams no more.\r\n    And then I think of one who in her youthful beauty died,\r\n    The fair meek blossom that grew up and faded by my side:\r\n    In the cold moist earth we laid her, when the forest cast the leaf,\r\n    And we wept that one so lovely should have a life so brief:\r\n    Yet not unmeet it was that one, like that young friend of ours,\r\n    So gentle and so beautiful, should perish with the flowers.\r\n\r\n

There is no flower appropriated to this day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dial of Flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n    ’Twas a lovely thought to mark the hours,\r\n      As they floated in light away,\r\n    By the opening and the folding flowers\r\n      That laugh to the summer’s day.\r\n\r\n    Thus had each moment its own rich hue,\r\n      And its graceful cup and bell,\r\n    In whose coloured vase might sleep the dew,\r\n      Like a pearl in an ocean shell.\r\n\r\n    To such sweet signs might the time have flowed,\r\n      In a golden current on,\r\n    Ere from the garden, man’s first abode,\r\n      The glorious guests were gone.\r\n\r\n    So might the days have been brightly told--\r\n      Those days of song and dreams--\r\n    When shepherds gathered their flocks of old\r\n      By the blue Arcadian streams;\r\n    So, in those isles of delight, that rest\r\n      Far off in a breezeless main,\r\n    Which many a bark with a weary guest\r\n      Has sought, but still in vain.\r\n\r\n    Yet is not life, in its real flight,\r\n      Marked thus--even thus--on earth,\r\n    By the closing of one hope’s delight,\r\n      And another’s gentle birth?\r\n\r\n    Oh! let us live so that, flower by flower,\r\n      Shutting in turn, may leave\r\n    A lingerer still for the sunset hour,\r\n      A charm for the shaded eve!\r\n\r\n    _Hemans._\r\n\r\nWhen a plant is approaching its state of perfection, when its organs of\r\nnourishment are completely developed, and its vegetation is most\r\nluxuriant, then arrives the time of flowering, which has been aptly\r\ntermed “the joy of plants.” The most superficial observer must have\r\nnoticed how different is the season of flowering of individual plants,\r\nand how each month is adorned with its particular flowers. When the\r\nintense cold of January confines us to our houses, the Black Hellebore,\r\nor Christmas Rose, unfolds its dazzling white blossoms; in February, the\r\ninnocent Snowdrop presents to us her elegant cup. In the same month the\r\nHazel puts forth its catkins, and not rarely the early-blooming Crowfoot\r\nshows the blue tips of its clusters of blossom. March boasts a richer\r\nFlora; then the Violet delights us with its fragrance; the Mezereon\r\noffers its peach-coloured flowers, and the Primrose leads on a long\r\ntrain of the charming children of Spring. These now continue to advance\r\nin increasing numbers, displaying, especially in May and June, their\r\nhighest splendour; till at length the Meadow Saffron takes leave of\r\ninclement Autumn, and, saturated with rain, the Mosses acquire fresh\r\nvigour, and open to the botanist a new field for investigation.\r\n\r\nNot less different than the period of flowering is the time of the\r\nopening and shutting of flowers. Some plants habitually open and close\r\ntheir flowers by turns; others are governed in these respects by the\r\nweather; others again, by the length or shortness of the day: while some\r\nopen and shut at certain hours, and thus furnish materials for composing\r\nthe Dial of Flowers.\r\n\r\nAccording to the observations of later botanists, the flowery crown of\r\nplants serves, among other things, to envelop the tender organs of\r\nfructification, and to protect them from the pernicious influence of\r\nexternal agents. Those organs of fructification are the chief objects of\r\nthe maternal care of Nature; while shut up in the flower-bud, they\r\nacquire that strength and perfection of parts which enable them to\r\nendure the light of the sun, and to perform the functions for which they\r\nare designed. It is not till they are capable of fulfilling these\r\nfunctions that the flower unfolds itself; but it again closes at such\r\ntimes when external influences might be injurious to the delicate organs\r\nof fructification. Many flowers can bear only the refreshing morning air\r\nand the first rays of the sun, but remain shut all the rest of the day.\r\nThis may be particularly observed in the different species of\r\nConvolvulus, Ipomæa, and Goat’s Beard. We find these, in general, open\r\nonly till about eleven o’clock. In like manner, the Mallows and the\r\nMesembryanthemums unfold their flowers about noon: and precisely at that\r\ntime, in serene weather, open the singularly-formed Drosera, and the\r\ncommon Purslain, which shut again in an hour. Others unfold themselves\r\nonly in the evening, and continue open all night, probably because their\r\ndelicate organs would be injured by the sun. The Œnotheras, the Gauras,\r\nand the different species of the Mirabilis, furnish examples of this\r\nkind. Thus, too, the Cactus opuntia opens its magnificent blossoms at\r\nnight only, and towards morning shuts them up for ever. The flowers of\r\nmany plants of the nineteenth class are observed to hang their heads\r\nduring night--the Camellia, for example--by which means the rain, or\r\ndew, which might injure the tender organs of fructification, can run off\r\nthe more easily. In other plants of this class, the flower shuts up\r\nagainst rain, and on the approach of evening, as is the case with the\r\nMarigolds.\r\n\r\nThe periodical change of colour in some flowers is also worthy of\r\nremark. Thus, the flowers of the speckled French Honeysuckle (_Hedysarum\r\nmaculatum_) are purple in the morning and green at noon. The changeable\r\nHibiscus (_Hibiscus mutabilis_) is white in the morning, flesh-coloured\r\nat noon, and rose-red in the evening. Thus, too, the great Corn-flag\r\n(_Gladiolus grandis_) changes its colour several times in the course of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nNeither is the scent of flowers equally strong and agreeable at all\r\nhours of the day: many, even of our indigenous flowers, have the\r\nstrongest scent at night. The _Ixia cinnamomea_ gives out its fragrance\r\nin the evening only; the highly-scented Lesser Orpine (_Crassula\r\nodoratissima_) only in the night; the _Epidendrum fragrans_, morning and\r\nevening; another species of Epidendrum, hung up in a room, without earth\r\nor water, yields an agreeable perfume for years. The flowers of the\r\n_Hebenstreitia dentata_ are scentless in the morning, have a\r\ndisagreeable smell at noon, and give out in the evening a fragrant\r\nodour, not unlike that of the Hyacinth.\r\n\r\nThese properties of flowers, and the opening and shutting of many at\r\nparticular times of the day, led to the idea of planting them in such a\r\nmanner as to indicate the succession of the hours, and to make them\r\nsupply the place of a watch or clock. Those who are disposed to try the\r\nexperiment may easily compose such a dial by consulting the following\r\ntable, comprehending the hours between three in the morning and eight in\r\nthe evening.\r\n\r\n+-------------------------------------------+--------+---------+\r\n|           Names of Plants.                |Hours of|Hours of |\r\n|
