We take our illustration from the\r\nLondon _Graphic_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 =Improvements in Silk Worm Breeding.=\r\n\r\n_Galignani_ states that a very curious discovery has just been made,\r\nwhich, if found as practicable in application as it seems to promise,\r\nmay create a very considerable change in the production of silk. It is\r\nnothing more nor less than the possibility of obtaining two yields in\r\nthe year of the raw material instead of one, as at present. The moth\r\nlays its eggs in May or June, and these do not hatch before the spring\r\nof the following year. But sometimes they are observed to hatch\r\nspontaneously ten or twelve days after they are laid. It was such a\r\ncircumstance as this coming to the attention of M. Ducloux, Professor of\r\nthe Faculty of Sciences at Lyons, that led him to undertake a series of\r\nexperiments on the subject, by means of which he has found that this\r\npremature hatching can be produced at will. The means for effecting the\r\nobject are very simple--rubbing the eggs with a hair brush, subjecting\r\nthem to the action of electricity, or more surely still by dipping them\r\nfor half a minute in concentrated sulphuric acid. M. Bollé, who has also\r\nturned his attention to the same subject, states that the same effect is\r\nproduced by hydrochloric, nitric, or even acetic and tartaric acid.\r\nFinally, a submersion of a few seconds in water heated to 50° Cent.\r\n(122° Fah.) is equally efficacious. However, M. Ducloux states that the\r\noperation must be performed while the eggs are quite young, the second\r\nor third day at the outside. When this new hatching is accomplished the\r\nmulberry tree is in its full vigor, and the weather so favorable that\r\nthe rearing of the worm is liable to much less risk than during the\r\nearly days of spring, when the sudden atmospheric changes are very\r\ndetrimental, and frequently fatal to the growing caterpillars.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   =The Natural History of the Eel.=\r\n\r\nAccording to the reports of shad fishermen, the chief enemy of the shad\r\nis the eel, which not only follows that fish up the streams and devours\r\nthe spawn, but often attacks the shad after they are caught in the nets.\r\nEntering the shad at the gill openings the eels suck out the spawn and\r\nentrails, and leave the fish perfectly clean. The finest and fattest\r\nshad are the ones selected. It is a curious circumstance that of a fish\r\nso well known as the eel so many of its life habits should be in\r\ndispute. An animated discussion has been going on in Germany quite\r\nrecently with regard to the natural history of this fish, and in a late\r\nnumber of a scientific journal the following points are set down as\r\npretty well substantiated. Though a fresh water fish which passes the\r\ngreater part of its life in rivers, the eel spawns in the sea. That it\r\nis viviparous is extremely improbable. The eel found in the upper waters\r\nof rivers is almost always female. At the age of four years it goes down\r\nto the sea to spawn and never returns to fresh water. The spawning\r\nprocess is somehow dangerous to the eel, thousands being found dead near\r\nthe mouths of rivers, with their ovaries empty. The descent of the fish\r\nto the sea does not appear to take place at any definite period, but is\r\nprobably dependent on the season for spawning. The male is always much\r\nsmaller than the female, and never exceeds half a yard in length. The\r\nmales never ascend to the head waters of rivers, but keep continually in\r\nthe sea or in the lower reaches of the river. Nothing is definitely\r\nknown about the spawning season, though it is probable that the eggs are\r\ndeposited in the sea not far from the mouths of rivers.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PARIS EXHIBITION.--A SKETCH IN THE PARK.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Scientific American.\" In Gothic script]\r\n\r\n                           Established 1845.\r\n\r\n                  MUNN & CO., Editors and Proprietors.\r\n\r\n                          PUBLISHED WEEKLY AT\r\n\r\n                       NO. 37 ARK ROW, NEW YORK.\r\n  ======================================================================\r\n            O.

It is stated that\r\nMessrs. Hopkins, Gilkes & Co., the well known iron makers of the North\r\nof England, have succeeded in turning out from it from Cleveland pig\r\nalone iron capable of bearing tests which Staffordshire iron has not yet\r\nsurpassed. The English iron manufacturers in their struggle with us are\r\nwisely taking advantage of every improvement in their line to keep ahead\r\nof us, and are likely to be successful unless our manufacturers arouse\r\nfrom their fancied security.\r\n\r\nWe are now underselling the English at home and abroad in many articles\r\nof manufacture, because so much of our work is done by machinery, and is\r\nconsequently better and cheaper than can be produced by hand labor at\r\nthe lowest living rate of wages; but so soon as the English masters and\r\nworkmen shall fully appreciate this fact, the same machines run there\r\nwith cheaper labor will deprive us of our present advantages.\r\n\r\nAlready we notice several instances in which the workmen, renouncing\r\ntheir prejudices, have willingly consented to the substitution of\r\nmachine for hand work, and we doubt not that the success of these\r\ninnovations, conjoined with the pressure of the times, will ere long\r\ncreate a complete revolution in the ideas of the British workmen, so\r\nthat instead of longer opposing they will demand the improved appliances\r\nand facilities for work, converting them from rivals or opponents to\r\nallies. Such a radical change is not necessarily far in the future, for\r\nthe logic of it has long been working in the brains of both masters and\r\nmen and may reasonably bear fruit at any time. We fear that when this\r\ntime arrives our makers of iron, especially, will wake up to the\r\nconsciousness that they have not kept up with the advance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n               =THE TELEPHONE AS A PROMOTER OF SCIENCE.=\r\n\r\nEvery new thing, whether it be in the realm of mind or matter, has an\r\ninfluence on whatever existed before, of a similar kind, to modify,\r\ndevelop, and improve it, or to doom it to oblivion. Whatever is new\r\nnecessitates a better knowledge of the old, so that the world gains not\r\nonly by the acquirement of the new thing, but also by a better\r\nunderstanding of things already known.\r\n\r\nA discovery, published, sets a thousand minds at work, and immediately\r\nthere is a host of experimentalists who, in their desire to make and try\r\nthe new thing for themselves, begin without a knowledge of the science\r\nor art to which the discovery pertains, and inevitably fail. After\r\nfailure comes research, which to be of value must be extended. Every\r\ninvestigator can recall the novelty that induced his first experiments,\r\nand can recount his trials in his search for information.\r\n\r\nAmong the inventions or discoveries that have induced extended\r\nexperiment, the telephone may, without doubt, be mentioned as the chief,\r\nfor no sooner was the first speaking telephone brought out than here and\r\nthere all over the country it was imitated. Persons who never had the\r\nslightest knowledge of electrical science had a desire to see and test\r\nthe telephone. To do this first of all requires a degree of mechanical\r\nskill. Acoustics must be understood, and a knowledge of the four\r\nbranches of electrical science is requisite, as the telephone involves\r\ngalvanism, magnetism, electrical resistance, induction, and many of the\r\nnicer points which can be understood by investigation only, and this not\r\nonly in the direction indicated, but in the allied branches of physics\r\nand also in chemistry. Familiarity with these things develops a\r\nscientific taste that will not be easily satisfied. The characteristic\r\navidity with which the American people seize upon a novelty has been\r\nwonderfully exemplified by the manner in which the telephone mania has\r\nspread.

E. Hughes\r\nconcerning the distinction he finds between his microphone and Mr.\r\nEdison's carbon telephone. Mr. Hughes is very confident that the two\r\ninventions have nothing in common, and that they bear no resemblance to\r\neach other in form, material, or principles.\r\n\r\nWe would not question Mr. Hughes' sincerity in all this. No doubt he\r\nhonestly believes that the invention of Mr. Edison \"represents no field\r\nof discovery, and is restricted in its uses to telephony,\" whilst the\r\n\"microphone demonstrates and represents the whole field of nature.\" But\r\nthe fact of his believing this is only another proof that he utterly\r\nfails to understand or appreciate the real scope and character of Mr.\r\nEdison's work.\r\n\r\nTo those familiar not only with Mr. Edison's telephone but with the long\r\nline of experimental investigation that had to be gone through with\r\nbefore he was able to control the excessive sensitiveness of the\r\nelements of his original discovery, it is very clear that Mr. Hughes has\r\nbeen working upon and over-estimating the importance of one phase, and\r\nthat a limited phase, of Mr. Edison's investigations.\r\n\r\nWe propose shortly to review at length the evidence of Mr. Edison's\r\npriority in the invention or discovery of all that the microphone\r\ncovers; this purely as a question of scientific interest.

And though, in comparison\r\nwith our capacity to produce, the foreign demand is yet small, its\r\npossibilities are unlimited. To increase the demand the immediate\r\nproblem is to make known throughout the world in the most attractive\r\nfashion possible the wide range of articles which America is prepared to\r\nfurnish, and which other nations have use for. As a medium for conveying\r\nsuch intelligence the monthly export edition of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN\r\nis unequaled. The table of contents of the second issue, to be found in\r\nanother column, will give an idea of the wide range and permanent as\r\nwell as timely interest of the matter it circulates. It is a magazine of\r\nvaluable information that will be preserved and repeatedly read. The\r\nhandsomely illustrated advertising pages supplement the text, and make\r\nit at once the freshest, fullest, and most attractive periodical of the\r\nsort in the world. An examination of the index of advertisers will show\r\nhow widely its advantages for reaching foreign buyers have been\r\nappreciated by leading American houses. In the advertising page XXV.\r\nappears a list of some eight hundred foreign commercial places in which\r\nthe circulation of the paper is guaranteed, as evidence that it reaches\r\nthose for whom such publications are intended.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            =FOUNTAIN PENS.=\r\n\r\nFor several days we have had in use in our office examples of the\r\nMackinnon Fountain Pen, and find it to be a very serviceable and\r\neffective instrument. This is a handsome looking pen, with a hollow\r\nhandle, in which a supply of ink is carried, and the fluid flows from\r\nthe point in the act of writing. The necessity of an inkstand is thus\r\navoided. One of the difficulties heretofore with pens of this character\r\nhas been to insure a free and certain delivery of the ink, and also to\r\nbring the instrument within the compass and weight of an ordinary pen.\r\nThe inventor seems to have admirably succeeded in the example before us.\r\nThe ink flows with certainty, and there is no scratching as with the\r\nordinary pen; it writes with facility on either smooth or rough paper;\r\nwrites even more smoothly than a lead pencil; may be carried in the\r\npocket; is always ready for use; there is no spilling or blotting of\r\nink. The construction is simple, durable, and the action effective. One\r\nfilling lasts a week or more, according to the extent of use. These are\r\nsome of the qualities that our use of the pen so far has seemed to\r\ndemonstrate; and which made us think that whoever supplies himself with\r\na Mackinnon Pen will possess a good thing. The sole agency is at No. 21\r\nPark Row, New York city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               =THE SUN.=\r\n\r\n             BY S. P. LANGLEY, ALLEGHENY OBSERVATORY, PA.*\r\n\r\nWhen, with a powerful telescope, we return to the study of the sun's\r\nsurface, we meet a formidable difficulty which our first simple means\r\ndid not present. This arises from the nearly constant tremors of our own\r\natmosphere, through which we have to look. It is not that the tremor\r\ndoes not exist with the smaller instrument, but now our higher\r\nmagnifying power exaggerates it, causes everything to appear unsteady\r\nand blurry, however good the glass, and makes the same kind of trouble\r\nfor the eye which we should experience if we tried to read very fine\r\nprint across the top of a hot stove, whence columns of tremulous air\r\nwere rising. There is no remedy for this, unless it is assiduous\r\nwatching and infinite patience, for in almost every day there will come\r\none or more brief intervals, lasting sometimes minutes, sometimes only\r\nseconds, during which the air seems momentarily tranquil. We must be on\r\nthe watch for hours, to seize these favorable moments, and, piecing\r\ntogether what we have seen in them, in the course of time we obtain such\r\nknowledge of the more curious features of the solar surface as we now\r\npossess.\r\n\r\nThe eye aches after gazing for a minute steadily at the full moon, and\r\nthe sun's light is from 300,000 to 600,000 times brighter than full moon\r\nlight, while its heat is in still greater proportion. The object lens of\r\nsuch a telescope as the equatorial at Allegheny is 13 inches in\r\ndiameter, and it is such light, and such heat, concentrated by it, that\r\nwe have to gaze on. The best contrivance so far found for diminishing\r\nboth, and without which our present acquaintance with the real\r\nappearance and character of sunspots would not have been gained, depends\r\nupon a curious property of light, discovered by a French physicist,\r\nMalus, in the beginning of this century. Let A (Fig. 10) be a piece of\r\nplane unsilvered glass, receiving the solar rays and reflecting them to\r\na second similar one, B, which itself reflects them again in the\r\ndirection C. Of course, since the glass is transparent, most of the rays\r\nwill pass through A, and not be reflected. Of those which reach B again\r\nmost will pass through, so that not a hundredth part of the original\r\nbeam reaches C. This then, is so far a gain; but of itself of little\r\nuse, since, such is the solar brilliancy, that even this small fraction\r\nwould, to an eye at C, appear blindingly bright. Now, if we rotate B\r\nabout the line joining it with A, keeping always the same reflecting\r\nangle with it, it might naturally be supposed that the light would\r\nmerely be reflected in a new direction unchanged in quantity.\r\n\r\nBut according to the curious discovery of Malus this is not what\r\nhappens. What does happen is that the second glass, after being given a\r\nquarter turn (though always kept at the same angle), seems to lose its\r\npower of reflection almost altogether. The light which comes from it now\r\nis diminished enormously, and yet nothing is distorted or displaced;\r\neverything is seen correctly if enough light remains to see it by at\r\nall, and the ray is said to have been \"polarized by reflection.\" It\r\nwould be out of place to enter here on the cause of the phenomenon; the\r\nfact is certain, and is a very precious one, for the astronomer can now\r\ndiminish the sun's light till it is bearable by the weakest eye, without\r\nany distortion of what he is looking at, and without disturbing the\r\nnatural tints by colored glasses. In practice, a third and sometimes a\r\nfourth reflector, each of a wedge shaped, optically plane piece of\r\nunsilvered glass, are thus introduced, and by a simple rotation of the\r\nlast one the light is graded at pleasure, so that with such an\r\ninstrument, called \"the polarizing eyepiece\" (Fig. A), I have often\r\nwatched the sun's magnified image for four or five hours together with\r\nno more distress to the eye than in reading a newspaper.\r\n\r\nWith this, in favorable moments, we see that the sun's surface away from\r\nthe spots, everywhere, is made up of hundreds of thousands of small,\r\nintensely brilliant bodies, that seem to be floating in a gray medium,\r\nwhich, though itself no doubt very bright, appears dark by comparison.\r\nWhat these little things are is still uncertain; whatever they are, they\r\nare the immediate principal source of the sun's light and heat. To get\r\nan idea of their size we must resort to some more delicate means of\r\nmeasurement than we used in the case of the watch. The filar micrometer\r\nconsists essentially of two excessively fine strands of cobwebs (or,\r\nrather, of spider's cocoon), called technically \"wires,\" stretched\r\nparallel to each other and placed just at the focus of the telescope.\r\nSuppose one of them to be fixed and the second to be movable (keeping\r\nalways parallel to the first) by means of a screw, having perhaps one\r\nhundred threads to the inch, and a large drum shaped head divided into\r\none hundred equal parts, so that moving this head by one division\r\ncarries the second \"wire\" 1/10000 part of an inch nearer to the first.\r\nMotions smaller than this can clearly be registered, but it will be\r\nevident that everything here really depends upon the accuracy of the\r\nscrew. The guide screw of the best lathe is a coarse piece of work by\r\ncomparison with \"micrometer\" screws as now constructed (especially those\r\nfor making the \"gratings\" to be described later), for recent uses of\r\nthem demand perhaps the most accurate workmanship of anything in\r\nmechanics--the maker of one which will pass some lately invented tests\r\nis entitled at any rate to call himself \"a workman.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11]\r\n\r\nSince the \"wires\" are stretched precisely in the focus, where the\r\nprincipal image of the sun is formed, and move in it, they, and the\r\nfeatures of the surface, form one picture, as magnified by the eye lens,\r\nso that they appear as if moving about on the sun itself. We can first\r\nset them far enough apart, for instance, to take in the whole of a spot,\r\nand then by bringing them together measure its apparent diameter, in ten\r\nthousandths of an inch. Then, measuring the diameter of the whole sun,\r\nwe have evidently the proportion that one bears to the other, and hence\r\nthe means of easily calculating the real size. A powerful piece of\r\nclockwork, attached to the equatorial, keeps it slowly rotating on its\r\naxis, at the same angular rate as that with which the sun moves in the\r\nsky, so that any spot or other object there will seem to stay fixed with\r\nrelation to the \"wires,\" if we choose, all day long. The picture of\r\n\"wires,\" spots, and all, may be projected on a screen if desired; and\r\nFig. 11 shows the field of view, with the micrometer wires lying across\r\na \"spot,\" so seen on the 6th of March, 1873. Part of a cambric needle\r\nwith the end of a fine thread is represented also as being projected on\r\nthe screen along with the \"wires\" to give a better idea of the delicacy\r\nof the latter.\r\n\r\nNow we may measure, if we please, the size of one of those bright\r\nobjects, which have just been spoken of as being countable by hundreds\r\nof thousands. These \"little things\" are then seen to be really of\r\nconsiderable size, measuring from one to three seconds of arc, so that\r\n(a second of arc here being over 400 miles) the average surface of each\r\nindividual of these myriads is found to be considerably larger than\r\nGreat Britain. Near the edge of the disk, under favorable circumstances,\r\nthey appear to rise up through the obscuring atmosphere, which darkens\r\nthe limb, and gathered here and there in groups of hundreds, to form the\r\nwhite cloudlike patches (_faculæ_), which may sometimes be seen even\r\nwith a spy-glass--\"something in the sun brighter than the sun itself,\"\r\nto employ the expression by which Huyghens described them nearly two\r\nhundred years ago. They are too minute and delicate objects to be\r\nrendered at all in our engraving; but this is true also of much of the\r\ndetail to be seen at times in the spots themselves. The wood cuts make\r\nno pretense to do more than give an outline of the more prominent\r\nfeatures, of which we are now about to speak. The wonderful beauty of\r\nsome of their details must be taken on trust, from the writer's\r\nimperfect description of what no pencil has ever yet rendered and what\r\nthe photograph has not yet seized.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. A.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\nBearing this in mind, let us now suppose that while using the polarizing\r\neyepiece on the part of the spot distinguished by the little circle, we\r\nhave one of those rare opportunities when we can, by the temporary\r\nsteadiness of our tremulous atmosphere, use the higher powers of the\r\ntelescope and magnify the little circle till it appears as in Fig. 12.\r\nWe have now nearly the same view as if we were brought close to the\r\nsurface of the sun, and suspended over this part of the spot. All the\r\nfaint outer shade, seen in the smaller views (the _penumbra_) is seen to\r\nbe made up of long white filaments, twisted into curious ropelike forms,\r\nwhile the central part is like a great flame, ending in fiery spires.\r\nOver these hang what look like clouds, such as we sometimes see in our\r\nhighest sky, but more transparent than the finest lace vail would be,\r\nand having not the \"fleecy\" look of our clouds, but the appearance of\r\nbeing filled with almost infinitely delicate threads of light. Perhaps\r\nthe best idea of what is so hard to describe, because so unlike anything\r\non earth, is got by supposing ourselves to look _through_ successive\r\nvails of white lace, filled with flower-like patterns, at some great\r\nbody of white flame beyond, while between the spires of the flame and\r\nseparating it from the border are depths of shade passing into\r\nblackness. With all this, there is something crystalline about the\r\nappearance, which it is hard to render an idea of--frost-figures on a\r\nwindow pane may help us as an image, though imperfect. In fact the\r\nintense whiteness of everything is oddly suggestive of something very\r\ncold, rather than very hot, as we know it really. I have had much the\r\nsame impression when looking into the open mouth of a puddling furnace\r\nat the lumps of pure white iron, swimming half-melted in the grayer\r\nfluid about them. Here, however, the temperature leaves nothing solid,\r\nnothing liquid even; the iron and other metals of which we know these\r\nspot-forms do in part at least consist are turned into vapor by the\r\ninconceivable heat, and everything we are looking at consists probably\r\nof clouds of such vapor; for it is fluctuating and changing from one\r\nform into another while we look on. Forms as evanescent almost as those\r\nof sunset clouds, and far more beautiful in everything but color, are\r\nshifting before us, and here and there we see, or think we see, in the\r\nsweep of their curves beyond, evidences of mighty whirlwinds (greater by\r\nfar than the largest terrestrial cyclone) at work. While we are looking,\r\nand trying to make the most of every moment, our atmosphere grows\r\ntremulous again, the shapes get confused, there is nothing left distinct\r\nbut such coarser features as our engraving shows, and the wonderful\r\nsight is over. When we consider that this little portion of the spot we\r\nhave been looking at is larger than the North and South American\r\ncontinents together, and that we could yet see its parts change from\r\nminute to minute, it must be evident that the actual motion must have\r\nbeen rapid almost beyond conception--a speed of from 20 to 50 miles a\r\n_second_ being commonly observed and sometimes exceeded. (A cannon ball\r\nmoves less than ¼ of a mile per second.) I have seen a portion of the\r\nphotosphere, or bright general surface of the sun, drawn into a spot,\r\nmuch as any floating thing would be drawn into a whirlpool, and then,\r\nthough it occupied by measurement over 3,000,000 miles in area,\r\ncompletely break up and change so as to be unrecognizable in less than\r\ntwenty minutes.\r\n\r\nWhen we come to discuss the subject of the sun's heat, we shall find\r\nthat the temperature of a blast furnace or of the oxyhydrogen blowpipe\r\nis low compared with that which obtains all over such a vast region, and\r\nremembering this, it is evident that its disappearance is a cataclysm of\r\nwhich the most tremendous volcanic outburst here gives no conception. We\r\ncannot, by any terrestrial comparison, describe it, for we have no\r\ncomparison for it in human experience. If we try to picture such an\r\neffect on the earth, we may say in another's words that these solar\r\nwhirlwinds are such as, \"coming down upon us from the north, would in\r\nthirty seconds after they had crossed the St. Lawrence be in the Gulf of\r\nMexico, carrying with them the whole surface of the continent in a mass,\r\nnot simply of ruin, but of glowing vapor, in which the vapors arising\r\nfrom the dissolution of the materials composing the cities of Boston,\r\nNew York, and Chicago would be mixed in a single indistinguishable\r\ncloud.\"\r\n\r\nThese vast cavities then in the sun we call spots are not solid things,\r\nand not properly to be compared even to masses of slag or scoria\r\nswimming on a molten surface. They are rather rents in that bright cloud\r\nsurface of the sun which we call the photosphere, and through which we\r\nlook down to lower regions. Their shape may be very rudely likened to a\r\nfunnel with sides at first slowly sloping (the _penumbra_), and then\r\nsuddenly going down into the central darkness (the _umbra_). This\r\ncentral darkness has itself gradations of shade, and cloud forms may be\r\nseen there obscurely glowing with a reddish tinge far down its depths,\r\nbut we never see to any solid bottom, and the hypothesis of a habitable\r\nsun far within the hot surface, suggested by Sir William Herschel, is\r\nnow utterly abandoned. We are able now to explain in part that\r\nmysterious feature in the sun's rotation before insisted on, for if the\r\nsun be not a solid or a liquid, but a mass of glowing vapor, it is\r\nevidently possible that one part of it may turn faster than another.\r\n_Why_ it so turns, we repeat, no one knows, but the fact that it does is\r\nnow seen to bear the strongest testimony to the probable gaseous form of\r\nthe sun throughout its mass--at any rate, to the gaseous or vaporous\r\nnature of everything we see. We must not forget, however, that under\r\nsuch enormous temperature and pressure as prevail there the conditions\r\nmay be--in fact, must be--very different from any familiar to us here,\r\nso that when we speak of \"clouds,\" and use like expressions, we are to\r\nbe understood as implying rather an analogy than an exact resemblance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12]\r\n\r\nWe must expect, with the great advances photography has lately made, to\r\nknow more of this part of our subject (which we may call solar\r\nmeteorology) at the next spot maximum than ever before, and by that time\r\nit may be hoped that some of the wonderful forms described above so\r\nimperfectly will have been caught for us by the camera.\r\n\r\n* For parts 1 and 2 see SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN for July 20 and July 27.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN the notice in our issue for July 27 of a new screw cutting lathe made\r\nby Messrs.

The gas generator, A, is of the common Swedish\r\ntype, as used for charcoal. The tube, _k_, conducts the gases into the\r\nrefining pot, _a_. This pot has a lining of refinery slag, which is\r\nmelted, as the apparatus revolves, to get it to adhere to the sides. The\r\nrevolution of the pot, _a_, on its axis, _d_, is effected by the action\r\nof the beveled wheels, _b_ and _b'_, and the pulley, _c_, which takes\r\nfrom an iron chain the power given off by a turbine. The spindle, _d_,\r\nis supported in the bearings, _e_ and _e', c_ carrying a pair of\r\ntrunnions which form the axis of oscillation, and allow the apparatus to\r\nrise or fall, the whole of this mechanism being supported on the plummer\r\nblocks, _f f_. One of the trunnions, _e''_, is prolonged so as to form\r\nthe axis of the beveled wheel, _b_, and the pulley, _c_, the latter\r\nsliding along the trunnion so as to put _b_ in or out of gear. The bush,\r\n_e_ is tied by means of the stay, _g'_ to the upper end of the toothed\r\nsegment, _g_, the lower extremity of which is connected with the second\r\nbush at the end of the spindle. By means of the pinion, _h_, revolving\r\non standards, _i i_, and the segmental rack, _g_, the pot can be raised\r\nor lowered without interfering with the action of the beveled wheels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: APPARATUS FOR MECHANICAL PUDDLING.]\r\n\r\nThe gas from the generator is brought to the mouth of the pot by the\r\ntubes, _k_ and _m_. The air necessary for the combustion of the gas is\r\nbrought in by a tube, _l_, branching from the air main, _l''_. The air\r\ntube, _l_, passes into the gas tube and is continued concentrically\r\nwithin the latter. The gas and air tubes both have joints at _m'_ and\r\n_m''_. By means of the bar, _n_, which has a counterpoise to keep the\r\nmoving parts in position, the tubes can be brought from or toward the\r\nmouth of the pot, so as to make it free of access to the workman. With a\r\nkey fitting on the stem, _n'_, the tubes can be turned in _m'_, so as to\r\ngive the currents of gas and air a more or less oblique direction. To\r\nscreen the workmen from the heat of the pot a disk of iron, _o_, lined\r\nwith fire clay on the side next the pot, is fitted to the end of the\r\ntubes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: APPARATUS FOR MECHANICAL PUDDLING.]\r\n\r\nBefore running the metal into the pot, the latter must be heated, to\r\nsuch a degree that the slag lining is pasty or semi-fluid at its\r\nsurface. Generally an hour and a half will be spent in heating with gas\r\nto this point. There should be sufficient live coal in the pot when the\r\ngas is first let in to keep up its combustion; should it be extinguished\r\nby excess of air or gas, it must be relit. As soon as the pot begins to\r\nget red hot the full heat can be put on.\r\n\r\nThe gas generator is tended in the usual way with the ordinary\r\nprecautions. To keep ashes and dust out of the gas tube, lumps of\r\ncharcoal are heaped up to the height of the top of the flue. The wind\r\npressure for the generator was 33 to 41 millimeters of mercury, that of\r\nthe wind for the combustion of the gas (at Finspong the blast is not\r\nheated) being only 16½ millimeters. The pressure of the gas in the tube\r\nnear the pot was 6.2 millimeters of mercury. The method of working,\r\nviewed chemically, does not sensibly differ from puddling; although\r\ngiving as good, perhaps better, results at a much less cost. There are\r\nthree principal periods in the operation: 1. The period before boiling.\r\n2. The boiling itself. 3. The end of the boiling, and the formation of\r\nballs. When cast metal is poured into the pot a shovelful or two of\r\nrefinery slag is added. The temperature of the bath is thus brought\r\ndown; it thickens and boils, the pot revolving at the rate of 30 or 40\r\nrevolutions a minute. The metal is worked with a rabble, either to cool\r\nit or to get the slag to incorporate with it, as is done in puddling.\r\nNote must be taken of the temperature of the melted metal and that of\r\nthe pot, at the moment of charging, the heat during working being\r\nregulated accordingly by increasing or diminishing the inflow of air\r\nand gas. When circumstances are favorable, boiling begins five minutes\r\nafter the metal is run into the pot, and it lasts about ten minutes.\r\n\r\nBoiling having begun, the batch swells, the iron forms, granulates, and\r\nseems to cling to the rabble and the sides of the pot. The rotation of\r\nthe pot is continued, as well as the working, to separate out parts\r\nwhich are not yet refined; but no more cold cinder is put in. While\r\nboiling goes on the temperature is regulated so that the pig does not\r\ncling to the side of the pot during a complete revolution, but so that\r\nthe particles next the side fall back into the bath when the side comes\r\nuppermost in the revolution. The heat is raised a little when the iron\r\ncan be felt by the rabble to be completely refined, when shining lumps\r\nmake their appearance in the bath, and the iron begins to cling to the\r\nwalls. At the moment, therefore, that the temperature is brought to its\r\nhighest point, and the iron begins to agglutinate, the rotation of the\r\npot should be stopped, and either immediately, or after the delay of a\r\ncouple of minutes, it is removed. If the iron does not ball well, it is\r\nnot completely refined, and the pot may be started again. If the iron is\r\nfirm enough already, the isolated particles are exposed to the hottest\r\nflame possible, the blast being carried to its maximum. The refining is\r\nthus completely finished, and all the particles are agglomerated. The\r\nmobility of the gas tube at _m''_ is of advantage in this operation. It\r\nis sometimes useful to start the pot again to round up the puddled ball,\r\nbut it is best if this has been formed with the rabble.\r\n\r\nThe iron from a charge of 75 kilos. of pig may be divided with advantage\r\ninto a couple of balls; a third may be made of the iron separated from\r\nthe walls of the pot. To get out the balls the pot is lowered, and the\r\nworkmen use tongs, pointed rabble, and hooked bar. If things have gone\r\nwell the balls ought to come out soft at a welding heat, filled with\r\ncinder like puddled balls, but a little more resisting and solid under\r\nthe hammer. They are forged into bars, and these are at once passed to\r\nthe rolls. If nothing hinders the balling and shingling, these\r\noperations will not consume more than fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       =Photographic Engraving.=\r\n\r\nScamoni's process is as follows: The original drawings are carefully\r\ntouched up, so that the whites are as pure and the blacks as intense as\r\npossible, and then the negative is taken in the ordinary way, the plate\r\nbeing backed in the camera with damp red blotting paper, to prevent\r\nreflection from the camera or back of the plate. The negative is\r\ndeveloped in the ordinary manner, intensified by mercuric chloride, and\r\nvarnished. A positive picture is taken in the camera, the negative being\r\ncarefully screened from any light coming between it and the lens. This\r\nis intensified by pyrogallic acid, and afterward washed with a pure\r\nwater to which a little ammonia has been added. It is then immersed in\r\nmercuric chloride for half an hour, and again intensified with\r\npyrogallic acid. This is repeated several times. When the intensity of\r\nthe lines is considerable, the plate is well washed, treated with\r\npotassium iodide, and finally with ammonia, the image successively\r\nappearing yellow, green, brown, and then violet brown. The plate is then\r\nthoroughly drained, and the image is treated successively with a\r\nsolution of platinic chloride, auric chloride, ferrous sulphate, and\r\nfinally by pyrogallic acid, which has the property of solidifying the\r\nmetallic deposits. The metallic relief thus obtained is dried over a\r\nspirit lamp, and covered with an excessively thin varnish. This varnish,\r\nwhich is evidently a special preparation, retains sufficient tackiness\r\nto hold powdered graphite on its surface (the bronze powder now used may\r\nbe employed instead), which is dusted on in the usual manner. After\r\ngiving the plate a border of wax, it is placed in an electrotyping bath,\r\nand a perfect facsimile in intaglio is obtained, from which prints may\r\nbe taken in a printing press.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     =A NEW DEEP SEA THERMOMETER.=\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of our readers may have seen a description of a form of\r\nthermometer devised by MM. Negretti and Zambra for the purpose of\r\nascertaining the temperature of the ocean at great depths. This\r\nconsisted of a tube bent into the shape of a siphon, which when it had\r\nreached the desired depth was made, by means of an ingenious\r\narrangement, to pour all the mercury found above a certain point near\r\nthe reservoir into the second arm of the siphon. This second arm, which,\r\nlike the other, was a capillary tube, carried a scale of divisions on\r\nwhich might be read the temperature of the depths to which the\r\ninstrument had been lowered. This thermometer gave all the results that\r\nmight have been expected. The ship Challenger during its polar\r\nexpedition had on board a certain number of these instruments. The\r\nreport of Capt. G. S. Nares made to the English Admiralty describes all\r\nthe benefits that we may hope to reap from a serious study of the\r\ntemperature of the ocean at different depths, and not the least of these\r\nare those that pertain to the fishery interest. Notwithstanding the good\r\nresults given by this instrument, its inventors have endeavored to\r\nrender it still more practical and more within the reach of all by\r\ndiminishing the cost of construction, and increasing its compactness.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1 Fig. 2 Fig. 3 NEW THERMOMETER FOR OBTAINING THE\r\nTEMPERATURE OF THE OCEAN AT GREAT DEPTHS.]\r\n\r\nFig. 1 represents the thermometer isolated from its case. It is an\r\nordinary thermometer furnished at A with a little device that M.\r\nNegretti has already made use of in the construction of his larger\r\ninstrument, and which allows the liquid to run from the reservoir into\r\nthe capillary tube when the temperature rises, without letting it flow\r\nback when it lowers, if moreover the precaution has been taken to\r\nincline the tube slightly, reservoir upward. At B there is a bulge in\r\nthe tube in which a certain quantity of mercury may lodge; this bulge is\r\nplaced in such a way that the mercury resulting from the dilatation of\r\nthe reservoir may come to it and continue its ascension in the capillary\r\ntube when the reservoir is down (the thermometer being vertical), but\r\ncannot get out when the reservoir is upward.\r\n\r\nWe should add that these thermometers are constructed so as to give the\r\nvariations of temperature within determined limits.\r\n\r\nThe small reservoir, B, is indispensable to the well working of the\r\napparatus; for in seeking the temperature at a certain depth the\r\ninstrument may, on being drawn up, pass through warmer strata, and it is\r\nnecessary, therefore, to provide the reservoir with a means of diffusing\r\nthe small quantity of mercury resulting from this excess of temperature.\r\nThe tube has also a small bulge at its upper extremity at C.\r\n\r\nThe thermometer is placed in a small wooden case having a double bottom\r\nthroughout its length. In this double bottom are placed a certain number\r\nof lead balls that can run from one end of the case to the other, and of\r\nsufficient weight to render the instrument buoyant in sea water. To use\r\nthe apparatus, one end of a cord is passed through a hole in the case\r\nunder the reservoir of the thermometer, and the other end is tied to the\r\nsounding line at a certain distance from the lead (Fig. 2). While the\r\nline is descending the thermometer will remain reservoir downward (Fig.\r\n2); but when it is again drawn up the thermometer case will take the\r\nposition indicated in Fig. 3, and the column of mercury breaking at A\r\nwill fall into the capillary tube, the divisions of which, as will be\r\nseen at Fig. 1, are reversed.\r\n\r\nAs to the thermometer itself, it is important to protect it against the\r\npressure which becomes so considerable at great depths; to do this the\r\nreservoir is surrounded by an envelope of thick glass about three\r\nquarters full of mercury. The mercury serves to transmit the temperature\r\nto the reservoir, and should the exterior envelope yield to the effects\r\nof pressure, the reservoir proper would not be affected, the mercury not\r\nexactly filling the annular part which surrounds it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           =New Inventions.=\r\n\r\nGeorge E. Palmer, of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, has patented an improved\r\nIroning Board, on which the garments may be held in stretched state\r\nwhile being smoothed with the irons, and readily adjusted thereon to any\r\nrequired degree of tension by a simple attachment.\r\n\r\nWilliam B. Rutherford and Joel T. Hawkins, of Rockdale, Texas, have\r\npatented an improved Bale Tie, which is formed of the plate provided\r\nwith a longitudinal groove and cross ribs or loops, and having\r\nprojections or keys to adapt it to receive and hold the notched ends of\r\nthe bale band.\r\n\r\nAn improvement in Composition Pavements has been patented by John C.\r\nRussell, of Kensington, Eng. This invention relates to the treatment of\r\npeat and spent tan for the manufacture of an improved product or\r\nmaterial suitable for paving roads and other places and for roofing,\r\netc. The most important steps in making the composition consist in\r\ndrying bruised or finely ground peat or spent tan, heating the same _in\r\nvacuo_ to degree of 150° Fah., and adding sulphur and gas tar, gas\r\npitch, and stearine pitch in the proportions specified, then kneading\r\nthe mixture while heated and adding carbonate of lime and furnace slag.\r\n\r\nLouis Blanck, of New York city, has patented an improved Safety Brake or\r\nattachment for locomotives and railroad cars, by which the entire train,\r\neither by a collision with another train or by contact with any\r\nobstruction, is first raised from the rails, and then moved in backward\r\ndirection for the distance of a few feet, so that all danger of accident\r\nis avoided, and no other sensation than that of a slight rocking motion\r\nexerted. The attachment is constructed so as to admit of being worked by\r\nthe engineer from the cab or the locomotive, or, if desired, from any\r\ncar of the train.\r\n\r\nAn improved Evaporating Pan had been patented by Andrew D. Martin, of\r\nAbbeville, La. This invention consists in a tapering sheet metal tank\r\nhaving transverse partitions and longitudinal tapering flues that extend\r\nthrough all of the partitions and terminate at the ends of the tank.\r\n\r\nLloyd Arnold, of Galveston, Texas, has patented an improved Bale Tie,\r\nwhich is formed of a block of iron, with a space or opening running\r\nlongitudinally through its breadth from one end nearly to the other, and\r\nhaving the alternate edges of the two plates thus formed notched, the\r\nnotch of the lower plate being square and of a width equal to or a\r\nlittle greater than the bale band, and the notch of the upper plate\r\nbeing narrower at its bottom than the bale band, and with its sides\r\ninclined and beveled to an edge, to adapt it to receive and hold the\r\nbale band.\r\n\r\nAn improved Tie for Letter Packages has been patented by John Mersellis,\r\nof Knowersville, N. Y. The object of this invention is to provide a tie\r\nby means of which letter packages may be quickly and securely fastened\r\nor tied. It consists in a plate apertured to receive one end of the\r\nstring and also to receive the hook upon which the tie is hung when not\r\nin use, and having a button and clasp spring for engaging the string in\r\nthe process of tying.\r\n\r\nFred P. Hammond, of Aurora, Ill., has patented an improved Inking Pad,\r\nwhich consists in a novel arrangement of layers of cloth or felt,\r\nchamois skin, oiled silk, and printing roller composition, which enables\r\na clean impression of the stamp to be made. The pad retains the desired\r\nrounded surface and proper degree of softness, and is easily manipulated\r\nwhen necessary to replenish the supply of ink.\r\n\r\nWilliam J. Clark and Thomas W. Roberts, of Coffeeville, Miss., have\r\npatented an improved Trap for Catching Fish in streams, which will allow\r\nthe fish to be conveniently taken out without taking up the trap.\r\n\r\nJohn W. Cooper, of Salem, Ind., is the inventor of an improved Alcohol\r\nLamp for soldering and similar purposes; and it consists in a reservoir\r\npivoted in a supporting frame, and provided with two wick tubes, and an\r\nextinguisher secured to a spring support, and capable of closing the\r\nlarger wick tube when it is in a vertical position. It has an\r\nindependent extinguisher for the smaller wick tube, and is provided with\r\na novel device for projecting the wick from the larger tube as it is\r\nmoved out of a vertical position.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Slater, of Attica, N. Y., has invented a simple and effective\r\ndevice for Renovating Feathers by the combined action of steam and hot\r\nair. It consists of a cylindrical receptacle, partly surrounded by a\r\nsteam jacket, and having a hot air box, a perforated bottom, a cover or\r\ndamper for the same, and an aperture in the top, to which is fitted a\r\nperforated cover and a close cover.\r\n\r\nAn improved Blind Fastening has been patented by George Runton and John\r\nRunton, of Hoboken, N. J. This fastening is so constructed as to fasten\r\nthe blind or shutter automatically when swung open, and in such a way as\r\nto prevent all rattling or shaking of the blind or shutter from the\r\naction of the wind.\r\n\r\nDavid R. Nichols, of Alexandria Bay, N. Y., has patented an improved\r\nAnimal Trap, which is so constructed as to set itself after each animal\r\nhas been caught, and leave no trace of the trapped animal to frighten\r\naway those that may come afterward.\r\n\r\nWilliam A. Doherty, of Fall River, Mass., has patented an improved Loom\r\nShuttle Attachment, by which the weaving of bad cloth is prevented, and\r\nin case any false shed is made by any irregularities in the warp, and\r\nthat part of the shed carried lower than usual, the attachment is\r\nreleased and thrown over the spindle point, so as to render it\r\nimpossible to draw out the filling from the shuttle, and thus break it\r\nand stop the loom.\r\n\r\nJonas Bowman, of Somerset, O., has patented an improved Vehicle Spring,\r\nwhich permits of dispensing with side bars, thus taking less space to\r\nturn on, and by which the tilting and pitching motion usual with springs\r\nas heretofore constructed is avoided.\r\n\r\nHiram Unger, of Germantown, O., is the inventor of an improved Gate\r\nLatch, which is so constructed that the gate cannot be opened\r\naccidentally by being lifted or by rebounding of the catch or latch.\r\n\r\nMadison Calhoun, of Ocate, Ter. of New Mex., has patented an improved\r\nHame Fastening, which is not liable to become accidentally unfastened,\r\nand is easily and quickly fastened and unfastened, even with cold or\r\ngloved hands.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Downer well at Corry, Pa., is now down over 1,300 feet, and an oil\r\nbearing sand has been struck of about five feet thickness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Communications.\", in Gothic script.]\r\n\r\n\r\n                           =Our Patent Law.=\r\n\r\n_To the Editor of the Scientific American_:\r\n\r\nWhile I cannot handle this subject with any master talent, nor afford to\r\ndevote the time which should be given to so important a subject before\r\nexpressing an opinion, yet I can less afford to keep quiet and allow\r\nshrewd avarice to manipulate or titled ignorance to legislate my\r\nproperty out of existence. \"Property! There is no property in patents,\"\r\nI often hear said. And how about the invention covered by a patent? Is\r\nthat property? A large majority of people may say no, and deny the\r\njustice of a patent law. On the contrary, I, as an inventor, think an\r\ninvention is genuine property, and as such should be under the same\r\nprotection in common law as all other property, instead of requiring a\r\nspecial law by which the people magnanimously grant me the privilege for\r\na short time of using what was never theirs, what they never knew of\r\nuntil I brought it into existence.\r\n\r\nBut what is real property, and by what title is it held? Mother earth,\r\nfrom which we sprung, by which we exist, and to which we return, is,\r\nwithout question, real estate. How is it obtained; how held? History\r\nanswers, By conquest, by subjugation. But these words, conquest and\r\nsubjugation, have a more significant meaning than the spoiling of one\r\npeople by another; they are the actual price of possession. He who,\r\ntoiling, subjugates the soil, is undoubted owner of its production, by\r\nvirtue of the highest blessing on record--\"By the sweat of thy brow\r\nshalt thou obtain bread.\" And this principle is so far acknowledged that\r\nthe laborer holds a lien on the product of his labor, even though the\r\nproperty belongs to another.\r\n\r\nMr. A has an unpromising piece of land on which he would like to raise\r\ncorn. He analyzes the soil, experiments upon it chemically, reads up on\r\nthe properties and components of corn, the effects of fertilizers and\r\nacids upon the soil, and makes himself a fool and laughing-stock\r\ngenerally among his neighbors because he steps out of the beaten track\r\nby which they have succeeded in making the ground barren. He does not\r\nhave much success the first year, and is sympathizingly consoled with \"I\r\ntold you so.\" But he perseveres and wins the reputation of being\r\n\"visionary\" and \"as stubborn as a mule.\" In the meantime he becomes more\r\nfamiliar with his subject, sees more clearly the requirements of the\r\ncase, finds he must post himself more thoroughly in certain branches of\r\nscience in order to conduct his experiments, wrestles with this obstacle\r\nand that, and finally discovers a fertilizer based on some natural law\r\nof rotation, and produces a crop of corn never before equaled. Now his\r\nneighbors come out with this very intelligent question, \"How did you\r\nhappen to think of it?\" And they further very condescendingly remark,\r\n\"That is a rousing crop; I guess I'll try the same thing myself. How did\r\nyou say you mixed the stuff?\" This man is the true conqueror. He has\r\nendured privation and scorn, fought obstacles, and in subduing them has\r\neliminated a new principle in agriculture that is an engine of power to\r\nall generations. Shall his crops be his only reward? Shall they who\r\nlaughed him to scorn step into his reward without sharing the labor that\r\nproduced it?\r\n\r\nThis is a simile for thousands of inventions, only that the inventor is\r\nseldom situated to plant the corn on his own land and reap the harvest.\r\nThen which of you will say that he has not a just lien on every man's\r\ncrop raised by his process for a per cent of the gains thereby? There is\r\na bill before Congress favoring a periodical taxation of patents under\r\nthe pretext of removing useless patents from the path of later\r\ninventors. Let me show you how one inventor looks at that. My neighbor\r\nhas a vacant lot on which he is unable to build; but joined to mine it\r\nwould increase the value of my property vastly. Now can't you legislate\r\nthat old heap of rubbish into my possession somehow? Of course he is\r\nwaiting for the rise of property around him to sell his lot well; but\r\ncan't you make that appear unnatural, and that he is a dog in the\r\nmanger? It is also said that sharpers get control of old patents and lay\r\nan embargo on legitimate business. I reply, first, no one could be\r\ndamaged by the owner of a patent unless he infringed that owner's right;\r\nsecond, if he does infringe, it shows that said patent is valuable,\r\notherwise he need not infringe; and if valuable why should not he pay\r\nfor it? Mr. B, in the employ of Mr. C, watches the machine he uses, and\r\nspends his leisure hours in working out an improvement, which he patents\r\nand offers to C for sale; but as the invention is useless except as\r\nattached to C's machine, he thinks B can't help himself, and adopts the\r\nimprovement without paying for it. When a few years have built up a\r\ngreat industry, and C is rich from his spoils, B steps in with a few\r\nfriends at his back, incorporated especially to make C shell out.\r\n\r\nOf course this is bad and ought to be legislated against. If it were not\r\nvaluable C need not use it. It is not becoming to the Congress of a\r\ngreat nation to spend its time in legislating worthless patents out of\r\nexistence. All such will die a natural death. And if there is sufficient\r\nworth in any patent to claim your consideration, the inventor is\r\nentitled to its price, whether he waits four years or fifteen for his\r\npay.\r\n\r\nI speak of myself, not as an individual, but as representing in this\r\nletter a class, without whose achievements America, in her proud length\r\nand breadth, could not to-day have been. For the last half of my past\r\nlife, over twenty years, I have been an inventor. Schooled in adversity,\r\naccustomed to disappointment, sometimes successful, enjoying no\r\nluxuries but the conquest of obstacles, and often forced to simple\r\npursuits to keep the pot boiling, yet I expect to spend the rest of my\r\nlife inventing, feeling strong in the school of experience, and hoping\r\nfor such prosperity as will enable me to work out some of the larger\r\nproblems in view.\r\n\r\nIf those in power would really aid the inventor, let them increase his\r\nfacilities for information. Circulate the Patent Office _Gazette_ at one\r\ndollar a year, a nominal subscription to insure _bona fide_ readers, and\r\npay the balance out of the Patent Office surplus now accumulated. This\r\nboth to educate and to save inventors from going over old ground,\r\nbringing more talent up to the standard of to-day. Lessen rather than\r\nincrease Patent Office fees. Enable the Commissioner to give the\r\nstrictest possible examination on every application for a patent, that\r\nwhen issued it shall bear a _bona fide_ value, by retaining the most\r\ncompetent examiners at a salary adequate to keep them. Reduce the\r\ncumbrous machinery of patent litigation to about this text, in two\r\nheadings: First, Is plaintiff the first inventor? Allow one month to\r\nfind that out. If not disproved in that time, allow it. Second, Does\r\ndefendant infringe? Allow one month to decide that. If not proven,\r\ndischarge the case, with cost to plaintiff. If proved, cost and damage\r\nto be settled by defendant in thirty days.\r\n\r\nThe ability of wealthy corporations to absorb with impunity the product\r\nof all talent within their reach, and put off the day of reckoning until\r\nplaintiff is swallowed in cost, is the greatest present discouragement\r\nto inventors. Our patent law is now better than any amendment yet\r\nproposed will leave it. If you must tinker over it, remember all laws\r\nare for protection of the weak. The bulldog does not need law to take\r\nthe bone from the spaniel. Just in proportion as you damage the patent\r\nlaw, you destroy the accomplishments and purpose of my life. Therefore I\r\nhave spoken; so could a thousand more.                 W. X.

This I have proved by the discovery that when two or\r\nmore electrical conducting bodies are placed in contact under very\r\nslight constant pressure, resting on any body whatever, they will of\r\nthemselves transform a constant electrical current into an undulatory\r\ncurrent, representing in its exact form the vibrations of the matter on\r\nwhich it reposes; it requires no complicated arrangement and no special\r\nmaterial, and to most experimenters the three simple iron nails that I\r\nhave described form the best and most sensitive microphone. But these\r\ncontact points would soon oxidize, so naturally I prefer some conducting\r\nmaterial which will not oxidize.\r\n\r\nMr. Edison's carbon telephone represents the principle of the varying\r\npressure of a diaphragm or its equivalent on a button of carbon varying\r\nthe amount of electricity in accordance with this change of pressure; it\r\nrepresents no field of discovery, and its uses are restricted to\r\ntelephony.\r\n\r\nThe three nails I have spoken of will not only do all, and that far\r\nbetter than Edison's carbon telephone in telephony, but has the power of\r\ntaking up sounds inaudible to human ears, and rendering them audible, in\r\nfact a true microphone; besides it has the merit of demonstrating the\r\nmolecular action which is constantly occurring in all matter under the\r\ninfluence of sonorous vibrations.\r\n\r\nHere we have certainly no resemblance in form, materials, or principles\r\nto Mr. Edison's telephone. The carbon telephone represents a special\r\nmaterial in a special way to a special purpose.\r\n\r\nThe microphone demonstrates and represents the whole field of nature;\r\nthe whole world of matter is suitable to act upon, and the whole of the\r\nelectrical conducting materials are suitable to its demonstrations.\r\n\r\nThe one represents a patentable improvement; the other a discovery too\r\ngreat and of too wide bearing for any one to be justified in holding it\r\nby patent, and claiming as his own that which belongs to the world's\r\ndomain.\r\n\r\n  London, July 2, 1878.

Whenever there are latent resources undeveloped\r\nor opportunities for establishing the first foundation of an industry,\r\nleading as it will to the originating of hundreds of auxiliary ones, an\r\nunusual effort should be made to bring it into existence. If in the\r\npower of individuals to accomplish, so much the better; if needing an\r\nassociation with State or national influence, then this association\r\nshould be formed. It is incumbent upon individuals that they possess a\r\nsufficient pride in the prosperity of the country to give every possible\r\nattention and assistance to a careful practical demonstration of the\r\nfeasibility of all the new industrial enterprises which may be presented\r\nwith reasonable assurance of final success.\r\n\r\nNot in a great expenditure of money: influence is better than money, and\r\na potential interest in a new enterprise is often better than capital.\r\nThe industrial resources of the United States are by no means worked to\r\ntheir full capacity. The people by no means make all they consume. The\r\nfiner articles of use, and requiring much labor and often the highest\r\nskill, are imported from foreign nations. A premium of $10,000 offered\r\nfor an improved method in any known present process of production or\r\nmanufacture would be almost sure to be called for.\r\n\r\nWhile America exports $175,000,000 worth of raw cotton annually to be\r\nworked up by other people, is it not possible to so increase the\r\nmanufacture in America as to keep the greater part of that raw material\r\nand to export the cloth instead? Is it not practicable to establish\r\ngreat numbers more of sugar estates in the same tropical climate? Is it\r\nnot practicable to lay the foundation of half a dozen beet sugar mills\r\nin the country? To begin the weaving of linen goods, and to teach our\r\nfarmers that they may produce all the flax fiber as fast as required? To\r\nstart a ramie industry in a small way and teach the process to those who\r\nwill engage in it?\r\n\r\nWill not our silk men put a velvet industry into operation as a germ\r\nfrom which a future industry may grow? And we might name a hundred other\r\nlesser enterprises which have hardly name in this country, but every one\r\nof which is needed and will add to the wealth of the people.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 =Replanting and Transplanting Teeth.=\r\n\r\nDr. G. R. Thomas, of Detroit, in the current number of the _Dental\r\nCosmos_, states that this operation of \"replanting\" has become so common\r\nwith him, and the results so uniformly satisfactory, that he does not\r\nhesitate to perform it on any tooth in the mouth, if the case demands\r\nit; and he finds the cases that demand it, and the number that he\r\noperates upon, continually multiplying.\r\n\r\nHe makes it a point to examine the end of the roots of nearly all his\r\ncases of abscessed teeth; and a record of more than 150 cases, with but\r\none loss (and that in the mouth of a man so timid that he utterly\r\nrefused to bear the pain which nearly always follows for a few minutes,\r\ntherefore necessitating re-extraction), convinces him that the operation\r\nis not only practical, but decidedly beneficial to both patient and\r\noperator. For one sitting is all that he has ever really found necessary\r\nto the full and complete restoration of the case.\r\n\r\nIn the present article, however, Dr. Thomas states that it is his object\r\nnot so much to speak of replanting as of transplanting, which he has\r\nreason to believe is just as practical, so far as the mere re-attachment\r\nis concerned, as is replanting. He details, in illustration, a case in\r\nwhich he successfully performed the operation; inserting in the mouth of\r\na gentleman, who had lost a right superior cuspidate, a solid and\r\nhealthy tooth that he had removed from a lady's mouth four weeks\r\npreviously. He opened into canal and pulp chamber of the tooth, from the\r\napex of the root only; cut the end off one eighth of an inch (it being\r\nthat much too long), reduced the size somewhat in the center of the root\r\n(it being a trifle larger than the root extracted), filled and placed it\r\nin position. He states that the occlusion, shape, and color were\r\nperfect, so much so that several dentists who saw the case were not able\r\nto distinguish the transplanted tooth from the others. The two features\r\nin the case that he calls particular attention to are: first, that\r\nalthough the tooth had been in his office four weeks, there is to-day no\r\nperceptible change in color; and second, that the re-attachment is as\r\nperfect as though it had been transplanted or replanted the same day of\r\nextraction. The operation was performed about three months ago. Dr.\r\nThomas knows of but two obstacles in the way of the perfect\r\npracticability of \"transplanting:\" first, the difficulty of obtaining\r\nthe proper teeth at the proper time; and second, the possibility of\r\ninoculation. The latter is the more formidable of the two, and, to\r\nescape the ills that might follow, the greatest caution is necessary.\r\nThe first difficulty is more easily gotten over, for it is not necessary\r\nthat the tooth transplanted should correspond exactly in shape and size\r\nto the one extracted; if it is too large, it may be carefully reduced;\r\nor if too small, new osseous deposit will supply the deficiency. Neither\r\nis it necessary, as we have seen, that the transplanted tooth should be\r\na freshly extracted one.\r\n\r\nAs a demonstration of what modern dental surgery is capable of\r\nperforming Dr. Thomas' statements are very interesting; it is doubtful,\r\nhowever, whether popular prejudice will allow this practice of\r\n\"transplanting\" to become of much use.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    =American Institute Exhibition.=\r\n\r\nFor forty-seven years the American Institute of New York has opened its\r\ndoors and invited American inventors and manufacturers to exhibit their\r\nproductions; and again this year it renews its invitation to all.

The Newcastle coal is principally\r\nused in the manufacture of London gas. Scotch parrot coal produces a\r\nsuperior gas, but the coke produced is of inferior quality. Boghead coal\r\nis also used for gas making--in fact, every kind of coal, except\r\nanthracite, may be used for this purpose. The bituminous shale produces\r\na very good gas, and it is used partly to supply the place of cannel or\r\nparrot coal. As carbon and hydrogen, principally with oxygen, are the\r\nelements from which gas is formed, most substances containing these\r\nelements can be partially converted into gas. And gas has been made from\r\ngrease or kitchen waste, oil peat, rosin, and wood, besides coal. A ton\r\nof Newcastle or caking coal yields about 9,000 cubic feet of gas, Scotch\r\ncoal about 11,000, English cannel about 10,000, and shale about 7,000,\r\nwith illuminating powers in the ratio of about 13, 25, 22, and 36\r\nrespectively. The coal is put in retorts, _r_, commonly made of fire\r\nclay and often of cast iron. These retorts are from 6 feet to 9 feet\r\nlong, and from 1 foot to 1 foot 8 inches in breadth. They are made like\r\nthe letter D, elliptical, cylindrical, or bean shaped. They are built\r\ninto an arched oven, and heated by furnaces, _f_, beneath. One, three,\r\nfive, seven, or more are built in the same oven. The mouthpieces are of\r\ncast iron, and project outward from the oven, so as to allow ascension\r\npipes, _a p_, to be fixed, to convey the gas generated from the coal to\r\nthe hydraulic main, _h m_. After the coal has been introduced into the\r\nretorts, their mouths are closed with lids luted round the edges with\r\nclay, and kept tight by a screw. The retorts are kept at a bright red\r\nheat. If the temperature be too low, less gas and more tar are produced,\r\nless residue being left; while, should the temperature be too high, the\r\nproduct is more volatile, more residue remaining. And should the gas\r\nremain for any length of time in contact with the highly heated retort,\r\nit is partially decomposed, carbon being deposited, thereby lessening\r\nthe illuminating power, and choking up the retort, and more carbon\r\ndisulphide is produced at a high temperature. The object is to maintain\r\na medium temperature, in order to obtain a better gas having the\r\ngreatest illuminating power. In about four or five hours the coal in the\r\nretort will have given off all its gas. The mouth of the retort is\r\nopened, and the coke is raked out into large iron vessels, and\r\nextinguished by water. A fresh charge is immediately introduced by means\r\nof a long scoop in the cherry-red retort, and the door luted to. The\r\nascension pipes, which convey the gas from the retorts, pass straight up\r\nfor a few feet, then turn round, forming an arch, then pass downward\r\ninto the hydraulic main, beneath the level of the liquid contained in\r\nit, and bubble up through the liquid into the upper portion of the main.\r\nOn commencing the main is half filled with water, but after working some\r\ntime, this water is displaced by the fluid products of distillation. In\r\nthis way, the opening into each retort is closed, so that a charge can\r\nbe withdrawn and replaced without interfering with the action of the\r\nother retorts and pipes. The liquid tar, ammoniacal water, and gas pass\r\nfrom the end, _e_, of the hydraulic main, down through the pipe, P, and\r\nthe liquid falls down into the tar well, T W, while the crude gas goes\r\non into the chest, C, partially filled with the liquid, so that the\r\nplates, _p p_, from the top dip into it to within a few inches of the\r\nbottom. These dip plates are placed in the chest, so as to separate the\r\nopenings into each pair of condensing pipes, _c c_, so that the gas\r\npassing into the chest finds no exit except up _c_{1}, and down\r\n_c_{2}; and there being no dip plate between _c_{2} and _c_{3} it\r\npasses up _c_{3}, and down _c_{4}, and as there is no dip plate to\r\nprevent its progress, it passes up _c_{5}, and down _c_{6}, into the\r\nlime or iron purifiers, L I. The condensers are kept cool by exposure to\r\nthe atmosphere, and are often cooled by a stream of water from a tank\r\nabove. The gas cools quickly, and liquids passing along with the gas in\r\na state of vapor are condensed and fall into the chest, and pass by an\r\noverflow pipe into the tar well. The purifier is a cast iron vessel, L\r\nI, containing a number of perforated shelves, _s_{1} _s_{1} _s_{1},\r\non which slaked lime, to the depth of about 4 inches, or much greater\r\nthickness of iron oxide and sawdust, is placed. The gas passes up\r\nthrough the shelves, _s s s_, and down through the shelves, _s_{1}\r\n_s_{1} _s_{1}, through the pipe, G, into the gas holder, and from\r\nthence through the pipe, M, to the main pipe. The lime abstracts\r\ncarbonic anhydride, sulphureted hydrogen, cyanogen, naphthalin, and a\r\nportion of the ammonia, but not carbon disulphide, which latter may be\r\nabsorbed by passing the gas through a solution of sodic hydrate and\r\nplumbic oxide, mixed with sawdust. Gas containing CS{2}, on burning,\r\nproduces H{2}SO{4}, which injures books and furniture in rooms.\r\nHowever, the quantity of CS{2} in gas is generally so minute as to be\r\npractically uninjurious. By a proper regulation of the temperature\r\nduring distillation, the quantity produced is infinitesimal. When the\r\nlime is saturated it is removed, and fresh supplied; but the iron, after\r\nuse, can be reconverted into oxide by exposure to the atmosphere, and\r\nused repeatedly. When iron is used a separate lime purifier is necessary\r\nto remove carbonic anhydride. The last traces of ammonia are removed\r\nbefore passing to the gas holder, by passing the gas through dilute\r\nsulphuric acid, or up through the interior of a tower having perforated\r\nshelves covered with coke in small pieces, through which a constant\r\nsupply of fresh water percolates. This washing removes some of the more\r\ncondensable hydrocarbons, and lessens the illuminating power of the gas.\r\nBefore the gas passes from the condensers into the purifiers, it passes\r\nthrough a kind of pump, termed an exhauster, driven by steam power. This\r\naction relieves the retorts from the pressure of the gas passing through\r\nthe hydraulic main, etc. It diminishes the deposit of graphite in the\r\nretorts, and lessens leakage in them, should there be any flaws. It also\r\nhas the beneficial effect of producing a gas of a higher illuminating\r\npower, since the relief of pressure in the retorts produces a more\r\nfavorable condition of combustion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DISTILLATION OF COAL.]\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the bodies produced in the manufacture of gas,\r\nnamely, acetylene, _g_, the carbonate, _s_, chloride, _s_, cyanide, _s_,\r\nsulphide, _s_, and sulphate, _s_, of ammonium; aniline, _t_, anthracene,\r\n_s_, benzine, _l_, carbonic oxide, _g_, carbonic anhydride, _g_,\r\ncarbonic disulphide, _l_, chrysene, _s_, cumene, _l_, cymene, _l_,\r\nethylene, _g_, hydrogen, _g_, leucoline, _l_, methyl-hydride, _g_,\r\nnaphthaline, _s_, nitrogen, _g_, paraffine, _s_, phenylic alcohol, _l_,\r\npicoline, _l_, propene, _g_, quartene, _g_, sulphureted hydrogen, _g_,\r\ntoluene, _l_, water, _l_, xylene, _l_, etc.\r\n\r\nThe most of the above solid and liquid substances, with the letters _s_\r\nand _l_ written after, are removed by cooling the gas in the condensers,\r\nand the gaseous substances marked _g_, that are injurious in the\r\nconsumption of the gas, are removed by purification. The impurities in\r\nthe gas may consist of ammonic carbonate and sulphide, carbonic\r\nanhydride and disulphide, nitrogen, oxygen, sulphureted hydrogen, and\r\nwater in the form of vapor; and acetylene, ethylene, and the vapors of\r\nthe acetylene, ethylene, and phenylene series of hydrocarbons are the\r\nilluminating ingredients diluted with carbonic oxide, hydrogen, and\r\nmethyl-hydride.

From that beginning it has increased to an annual\r\nproduction of 14,500,000 barrels of crude oil. The first export was in\r\n1861, of 27,000 barrels, valued at $1,000,000, and the export of\r\npetroleum in the year 1877 was, in round numbers, $62,000,000. The\r\nannual product of petroleum to-day--crude and refined--is greater in\r\nvalue than the entire production of iron, and is more than double that\r\nof the anthracite coal of the State of Pennsylvania, and exceeds the\r\ngold and silver product of the whole country. As an article of export it\r\nis fourth, and contests closely for the third rank. Our leading exports\r\nare relatively as follows: Cotton annually from $175,000,000 to\r\n$227,000,000; flour from $69,000,000 to $130,000,000; pork and its\r\nproducts (bacon, ham and lard) from $57,000,000 to $82,000,000; and\r\npetroleum from $48,000,000 to $62,000,000. The total export of petroleum\r\nfrom 1861 to and including 1877 (16 years) has been $442,698,968, custom\r\nhouse valuation. From the best sources of information there are at this\r\ntime 10,000 oil wells, producing and drilling, which, at a cost of\r\n$5,000 per well, would make an investment of $50,000,000 in this branch\r\nof the business. Tankage now existing of a capacity of 6,000,000 barrels\r\ncost $2,000,000, and $7,000,000 has been invested in about 2,000 miles\r\nof pipe lines connected with the wells. The entire investment for the\r\nexisting oil production, including purchase money of territory, is\r\nsomething over $100,000,000, which amount cannot be lessened much, if\r\nany, for as wells cease to produce new ones have been constantly drilled\r\nto take their place.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        =Minute Forms of Life.=\r\n\r\nThe Rev. W. H. Dallinger lately delivered a lecture at the Royal\r\nInstitution, descriptive of the recent researches of Dr. Drysdale and\r\nhimself. The object of the lecture was mainly to explain the method of\r\nresearch which had been employed. The first essays of the opticians to\r\nproduce \"high powers\" were, as might be expected, feeble. These powers\r\namplified, but did not analyze; hence it began to be questioned whether\r\n\"one could see more really with a high power than with a moderate one.\"\r\nAnd this was true at the time. But it is not so now. The optician has\r\nrisen to the emergency, and provided us with powers of great magnifying\r\ncapacity which carry an equivalent capacity for analysis. They open up\r\nstructure in a wonderful way when rightly used. The lecturer began by\r\nprojecting upon the screen the magnified image of a wasp's sting--an\r\nobject about the 1-20th of an inch in natural size--and beside it was\r\nplaced a piece of the point of a cambric sewing needle of the same\r\nlength, magnified to the same extent. The details of the sting were very\r\ndelicate and refined, but the minute needle point became riven and torn\r\nand blunt under the powerful analysis of the lens, showing what the\r\nlecturer meant by \"magnifying power;\" not mere enlargement, but the\r\nbringing out of details infinitely beyond us save through the well made\r\nlens. This was further illustrated by means of the delicate structure of\r\nthe _Radiolaria_, and still further by means of a rarely delicate valve\r\nof the diatom known as _N. rhomboides_. With a magnification of 600\r\ndiameters no structure of any kind was visible; but by gradually using\r\n1,200, 1,800, and 2,400 diameters, it was made manifest how the ultimate\r\nstructure of this organic atom displayed itself.\r\n\r\nBut this power of analysis was carried still further by means of the\r\nminutest known organic form, _Bacterium termo_. The lecturer had, in\r\nconnection with Dr. Drysdale, discovered that the movements of this\r\nmarvelously minute living thing were effected by means of a pair of fine\r\nfibers or \"flagella.\" These were so delicate as to be invisible to\r\neverything but the most powerful and specially constructed lenses and\r\nthe most delicate retinas. But since this discovery, Dr. Koch, of\r\nGermany, had actually photographed the flagella of much larger bacteria,\r\nsuch as _Bacillus subtilis_, and expressed his conviction that the whole\r\ngroup was flagellate. Mr. Dallinger determined then to try to measure\r\nthe diameter of this minute _flagellum_ of _B. termo_ that the real\r\npower of magnification in our present lenses might be tested. This was a\r\nmost difficult task, but 200 measurements were made with four different\r\nlenses, and the results were for the mean of the first 50 measurements\r\n0·00000489208; for the second, 0·00000488673; for the third,\r\n0·00000488024; for the fourth, 0·00000488200, giving a mean value for\r\nthe whole, expressed in vulgar fractions, of the 1/204700 of an inch as\r\nthe diameter of the flagellum of _B. termo_.\r\n\r\nWith such power of analysis it was manifest that immense results might\r\nbe expected from a good use of the \"highest powers.\" The proper method\r\nof using them was next dwelt on, and then the apparatus was described,\r\nby means of which a drop of fluid containing any organism that was being\r\nstudied might be prevented from evaporating while under the scrutiny of\r\nthe most powerful lenses, and for an indefinite length of time. The\r\nimportance of studying such organisms in this way--by continuous\r\nobservation--was then plainly shown, some of the peculiar inferences of\r\nDr. Bastian, as to the transmutation of bacteria into monads, and monads\r\ninto amoebæ, etc., being explained by discontinuity of observation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          =Wages in England.=\r\n\r\nConsul General Badeau reports that during the past five years wages have\r\nincreased gradually about 10 per cent, while the cost of living has\r\nincreased about 25 per cent. Clothing is about 30 per cent higher, while\r\nfuel has not risen in price. Agricultural laborers get from $2 to $3 per\r\nweek, including beer; building laborers and gardeners from $4.40 to\r\n$5.10 per week; bricklayers, carpenters, masons, and engineers from\r\n$6.80 to $11 per week; cabinetmakers, printers, and jewelers from $8 to\r\n$12.30 per week, although the best marble masons and jewelers receive\r\n$14.75. Bootmakers and tailors get from $4.86 to $7.65 per week, and\r\nbakers from $4.65 to $7.25, with partial board. Women servants are paid\r\nfrom $70 to $240 per annum. Railway porters and laborers on public works\r\nget from $4.45 to $12 per week. Rents have risen some 30 per cent, and\r\nare, for artisans in London, from $1.20 to $2.40 per week for one or two\r\nrooms.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                 =The Treatment of Cancer by Pressure.=\r\n\r\nM. Bouchut has recently introduced to the notice of the members of the\r\nAcadémie des Sciences a cuirasse of vulcanized caoutchouc, which he has\r\nused with success for the treatment of cancerous and other tumors of the\r\nbreast. In this country there has been much division of opinion upon the\r\nutility of pressure in the treatment of cancer, some surgeons regarding\r\nit as harmful, or but rarely useful, others attributing to it great\r\nretardation of the rapidity of growth of the tumor, or even cure. The\r\nsurgeons of Middlesex Hospital studied it systematically some years ago,\r\nand gave an unfavorable report. The theory of the plan is certainly\r\ngood: a neoplasia, like a healthy tissue, is dependent upon its blood\r\nsupply for vitality and growth, and complete anæmia causes the death of\r\na tumor, as it does of a patch of brain substance. It will be remembered\r\nthat Mr. Haward last year related at the Clinical Society a case in\r\npoint. He ligatured the left lingual artery for a recurrent epithelioma\r\nof the tongue; the tumor sloughed away, and a fortnight before the\r\npatient's death from blood poisoning the tongue was quite healed. In\r\njust the same way ischæmia will impair the vitality and so lessen the\r\ngrowth of a tumor. The difficulty is rather in the practical application\r\nof this theory. The knowledge that we now possess of the mode of growth\r\nof cancers gives us at least one important indication. If we have to\r\ndeal with a neoplasia that grows at the periphery by gradual\r\ninfiltration of the surrounding tissues, it is plain that, for pressure\r\nto be useful, it must be applied around the tumor rather than over it,\r\nwhere, by compressing and obstructing the capillaries, it would cause\r\noverfullness of those at the circumference. It is the periphery of a\r\ncancer that is its active part, and we must, therefore, produce ischæmia\r\naround and not in the tumor. In the application of the treatment this\r\nmust be obtained by the careful adjustment of elastic pads or cotton\r\nwool, and as the whole success of the plan depends upon the skill with\r\nwhich this is done, too much attention cannot be given to it. We cannot\r\nregard pressure as a substitute for removal of a cancer; but in the\r\nfrequent cases where this is impracticable it appears to be the best\r\nsubstitute at present open to the surgeon. M. Bouchut's cuirasse would\r\nseem to be an improvement upon the spring pads and other appliances in\r\nuse in this country.--_Lancet._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            =NEW CUTTING AND BORING ATTACHMENT FOR LATHES.=\r\n\r\nOur engraving represents a useful little machine which is intended for\r\nattachment to lathes. Although it is exceedingly simple it is capable of\r\nperforming a great variety of work.\r\n\r\nThe machine is used in two ways, either by attachment to a rigid\r\nsupport, as shown in Fig. 1, or by suspending it by a belt, so that it\r\nis capable of universal motion, as shown in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nThe supporting frame, A, has three boxes for the spindle, B, and on the\r\nshaft at one side of the middle box there are planing knives, C, on the\r\nopposite side there is a balance wheel, and a pulley for receiving the\r\ndriving belt. The spindle, B, extends beyond the ends of the frame, A,\r\nand has at each end a socket for receiving interchangeable cutting and\r\nboring tools. One end of the spindle is externally threaded to receive a\r\nface plate, to which may be attached a disk of wood for receiving\r\nsandpaper for smoothing and polishing wood or metal.\r\n\r\nThe frame, A, is held to its work by means of handles, A', and the\r\nspindle is driven by a round belt that passes over a suspended pulley,\r\nE, and also over the pulley on the lathe mandrel.\r\n\r\nThe entire attachment is balanced by a weight, F, attached to a cord\r\nthat passes over a fixed pulley, F', to the pulley, E, to which it is\r\nsecured by a swivel hook that permits of turning the belt in any\r\ndirection. The belt is guided by small pulleys, H, so that the device\r\nmay be turned without running the belt from the pulley on the spindle.\r\n\r\nGuides, G, are attached to the frame, A, for guiding the material being\r\noperated upon by the planing knives. The frame, A, may be supported by\r\nattachment to an arm, I, at the lower end of the screw-acted follower,\r\nJ, which slides in a rigid support, K. The arm, I, has a notched disk\r\nwhich is engaged by a spring detent which holds the frame at any desired\r\ninclination.\r\n\r\nAmong the kinds of work that may be done on this machine may be\r\nmentioned shaping and edging, fluting and beading table legs, balusters,\r\netc.; dovetailing, boring, carving, paneling, shaping or friezing\r\nmouldings, scroll or fret work, inlaying and engraving, blind stile\r\nmortising and blind slat planing. By changing the inclination of the\r\nspindle different varieties of mouldings may be produced by the same\r\ncutter.\r\n\r\nThe machine may be used as an emery grinder, and it may also be used for\r\ndrilling and shaping metals.

The decrease had been steady since 1869, previous to\r\nwhich there had been an increase. In his report for 1877, Mr. Draper\r\ndiscusses the question whether the change continues, or is likely to\r\ncontinue, in the same direction, and comes to the conclusion that the\r\nrainfall of New York will, most probably, continue to decrease by\r\nfluctuations for several years to come; also, that the variations are\r\nvery nearly the same in the two portions of the year, the division date\r\nbeing July 1.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           =NEW STEAM VALVE.=\r\n\r\nThe improved valve shown partly in section in the engraving is designed\r\nfor removing the water of condensation from steam pipes, so that dry\r\nsteam may be furnished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SAUNDERS' STEAM VALVE.]\r\n\r\nIn the engraving, the globe valve, A, is of the usual form, except that\r\nthe casing below the valve seat is enlarged, forming a pocket, B, which\r\ncommunicates through an aperture at the bottom with a small valve, C.\r\n\r\nThe steam, in passing through the valve, fills the pocket and there\r\ndeposits any water that may have condensed from the steam in its passage\r\nthrough the steam pipe. The increased depth of the lower portion of the\r\nvalve prevents siphoning, which takes place in valves of the ordinary\r\nform. The valve, C, is kept slightly open to discharge the water at the\r\nmoment it collects in the pocket; the water is thus prevented from\r\npassing onward to the engine or other point of use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =CUTTING AND BORING ATTACHMENT FOR LATHES.=]\r\n\r\nThis valve affords a ready means of supplying dry steam to sulphuric\r\nacid chambers. We are informed that by its use a chamber in ordinary\r\nworking order will produce acid 3° to 5° Baumé stronger than can be\r\nobtained with ordinary globe valves. Thirty steam pipes, arranged at\r\ndifferent points, are found to deliver into a chamber in the space of\r\nfive minutes from 4 to 16 ounces of condense water (according to the\r\ncircumstances of distance, temperature of the air, size of pipe, etc.).\r\nThese valves, being placed close to the chamber separating all the\r\ncondense water, deliver with certainty uniformly dry steam, without the\r\ninconvenience of ordinary steam traps or other expensive appliances.\r\n\r\nThis valve was patented through the Scientific American Patent Agency,\r\nMay 21, 1878.

This year it was\r\ndetermined to make still better time. Accordingly elaborate preparations\r\nwere made to reap, thrash, grind, and bake the grain with the least\r\npossible loss of time.\r\n\r\nIn 1 minute 15 seconds the wheat, about a peck, was cut and thrashed,\r\nand put on the back of a swift horse to be carried to the mill, 16 rods\r\naway. In 2 minutes 17 seconds the flour was delivered to Mrs. Lawton,\r\nand in 3m. 55s. from the starting of the reaper the first griddle cake\r\nwas done.

They are all distinguished by a very large beak, to which is\r\nadded a singular helmet-like appendage, equaling in size the beak itself\r\nin some species, while in others it is so small as to attract but little\r\nnotice. On account of the enormous size of the beak and helmet, the bird\r\nappears to be overweighted by the mass of horny substance which it has\r\nto carry, but on closer investigation the whole structure is found to be\r\nsingularly light and yet very strong, the whole interior being composed\r\nof numerous honeycombed cells with very thin walls and wide spaces, the\r\nwalls being so arranged as to give very great strength when the bill is\r\nused for biting, and with a very slight expenditure of material.\r\n\r\nThe greatest development of beak and helmet is found in the rhinoceros\r\nhornbill, although there are many others which have these appendages of\r\ngreat size. The beak varies greatly in proportion to the age of the\r\nindividual, the helmet being almost imperceptible when it is first\r\nhatched, and the bill not very striking in dimensions. The beak gains in\r\nsize as the bird gains in strength. In the adult the helmet and beak\r\nattain their full proportions. It is said that a wrinkle is added every\r\nyear to the number of the furrows found on the bill. The object of the\r\nhelmet is obscure, but the probability is that it may aid the bird in\r\nproducing the loud roaring cry for which it is so celebrated. The\r\nhornbill is lively and active, leaping from bough to bough with great\r\nlightness, and appearing not to be in the least incommoded by its huge\r\nbeak. Its flight is laborious, and when in the air the bird has a habit\r\nof clattering its great mandibles together, which together with the\r\nnoise of the wings produces a weird sound. The food of the hornbill\r\nseems to consist of both animal and vegetable matters.

The substances tested were\r\ncoarse and fine bran, material from stone grinding wheat; wheat dust,\r\nfrom wheat dust house; middlings, general mill dust, dust from middlings\r\nmachines, dust from flour dust house (from stones), and flour. When\r\nthrown in a body on a light, all these substances put the light out.\r\nBlown by a bellows into the air surrounding a gas flame, the following\r\nresults were obtained:\r\n\r\nCoarse bran would not burn. Fine bran and flour dust burn quickly, with\r\nconsiderable blaze. Middlings burn quicker, but with less flame. All the\r\nother substances burn very quickly, very much like gunpowder.\r\n\r\nIn all these cases there was a space around the flash where the dust was\r\nnot thick enough to ignite from particle to particle; hence it remained\r\nin the air after the explosion. Flour dust, flour middlings, etc., when\r\nmixed with air, thick enough to ignite from particle to particle, and\r\nseparated so that each particle is surrounded by air, will unite with\r\nthe oxygen in the air, producing a gas at high temperature, which\r\nrequires an additional space, hence the bursting.\r\n\r\nThere is no gas which comes from flour or middlings that is an\r\nexplosive; it is the direct combination with the air that produces gas,\r\nrequiring additional space. Powerful electric sparks from the electric\r\nmachine and from the Leyden jar were passed through the air filled with\r\ndust of the different kinds, but without an explosion in any case. A\r\nplatinum wire kept at a white heat by a galvanic battery would not\r\nproduce an explosion. The dust would collect upon it and char to black\r\ncoals, but would not blaze nor explode.\r\n\r\nA piece of glowing charcoal, kept hot by the bellows, would not produce\r\nan explosion when surrounded by dust, but when fanned into a blaze the\r\nexplosion followed. A common kerosene lantern, when surrounded by dust\r\nof all degrees of density, would not produce an explosion, but when the\r\ndust was blown into the bottom, through the globe and out of the top, it\r\nwould ignite. To explode quickly the dust must be dry. Evidently when an\r\nexplosion has been started in a volume of dusty air, loose flour maybe\r\nblown into the air and made a source of danger.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     =New Engineering Inventions.=\r\n\r\nErskine H.

To this end he has\r\nstudiously suppressed from Mr. Prescott's description of the carbon\r\ntelephone the points which establish Mr. Edison's claim to the prior\r\ninvention or discovery of everything involved in Mr. Hughes' microphone,\r\nwhile he has as studiously dwelt upon those same points as constituting\r\nthe peculiar merits of Mr. Hughes' work.\r\n\r\nFor example, while he uses Fig. 21 of Mr. Prescott's book, he leaves out\r\nthe very important little diagram numbered 20. It represents one form of\r\nthe apparatus to which Sir William Thomson refers in the letter in which\r\nhe says:\r\n\r\n\"It is certain that at the meeting of the British Association at\r\nPlymouth last September, a method of magnifying sound in an electric\r\ntelephone was described as having been invented by Mr. Edison, which was\r\nidentical in principle and in some details with that brought forward by\r\nMr. Hughes.\"\r\n\r\nThe figure looks altogether too much like one form of Mr. Hughes'\r\nmicrophone to allow of its use in an article intended to establish the\r\nnovelty of Mr. Hughes' discovery.\r\n\r\nThe omissions from the text are quite as significant. Under the first\r\ncut used in _Engineering_, Mr. Prescott says: \"In the latest form of\r\ntransmitter which Mr. Edison has introduced the vibrating diaphragm is\r\ndone away with altogether, it having been found that much better results\r\nare obtained when a rigid plate of metal is substituted in its place....\r\nThe inflexible plate, of course, merely serves, in consequence of its\r\ncomparatively large area, to concentrate a considerable portion of the\r\nsonorous waves upon the small carbon disk or button; a much greater\r\ndegree of pressure for any given effort of the speaker is thus brought\r\nto bear on the disk than could be obtained if only its small surface\r\nalone were used.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Engineering_ writer coolly suppresses this important statement. He\r\ndoes worse: he puts in its place the false statement that \"the essential\r\nprinciple of Mr. Edison's transmitter consists in causing a diaphragm,\r\nvibrating under the influence of sonorous vibrations, to vary the\r\npressure upon, and therefore the resistance of, a piece of carbon,\" and\r\nso on.\r\n\r\nA little further on, while repeating Mr. Edison's account of the\r\nexperiments which led to the abandonment of the vibrating diaphragm\r\n(page 226 of Mr. Prescott's book), the _Engineering_ writer drops out\r\nthe following remark by Mr. Edison: \"I discovered that my principle,\r\nunlike all other acoustical devices for the transmission of speech, did\r\nnot require any vibration of the diaphragm--that, in fact, the sound\r\nwaves could be transformed into electrical pulsations without the\r\nmovement of any intervening mechanism.\"\r\n\r\nWorse yet, in the very face of Mr. Edison's assertion to the\r\ncontrary--an assertion which he could not by any possibility have\r\noverlooked--this most unscientific journalist says: \"Mr. Edison finds it\r\nnecessary to insert a diaphragm in all forms of his apparatus, that\r\nbeing the mechanical contrivance employed by which sonorous vibrations\r\nare converted into variations of mechanical pressure, and by which\r\nvariations in the conductivity of the carbon or other material is\r\ninsured.... On the other hand, Mr. Hughes employs no diaphragm at all,\r\nthe sonorous vibrations in his apparatus acting directly upon the\r\nconducting material or through whatever solid substance to which they\r\nmay be attached.\"\r\n\r\nIn this way throughout the offending article, the writer persistently\r\nrobs Edison to magnify Hughes, giving credit to Mr. Hughes for exactly\r\nwhat he has suppressed from Mr. Prescott's book. To insist as he does,\r\nthat, because Mr. Edison covers his carbon button with a rigid iron\r\nplate, in his very practical telephone, therefore a vibrating diaphragm\r\nis an essential feature of Mr. Edison's invention, is a very shallow\r\nquibble in the face of Mr. Edison's and Mr. Prescott's statements that\r\nthe carbon button acts precisely the same in the absence of such\r\ncovering, though not so strongly. Mr. Edison's laboratory records show a\r\ngreat variety of experiments in which the carbon was talked against\r\nwithout \"any intervening mechanism.\" In a telephone for popular use,\r\nhowever, to be held in the hand, turned upside down, talked into,\r\nexposed to dust and the weather, it was obviously necessary to use some\r\nmeans for holding the carbon in place, and to prevent its sensitiveness\r\nfrom being destroyed by dirt and the moisture of the breath when in use.\r\nFor this purpose a rigid iron partition seemed at once convenient and\r\ndurable. It is not in any sense a \"vibrating diaphragm.\"\r\n\r\nWith a persistence worthy of a better cause, the _Engineering_ writer\r\nreturns to the point he seems especially anxious to enforce. Toward the\r\nend of the article he says: \"In every instrument described by Mr. Edison\r\nthe diaphragm is the ruling genie of the instrument. Professor Hughes,\r\nhowever, has through his great discovery been enabled to show that\r\nvariations of resistance can be imparted to an electrical current not\r\nonly without a diaphragm, but with very much better results when no such\r\naccessory is employed.\"\r\n\r\nThe animus of all this is only too apparent. Altogether the article is\r\nthe most dishonest piece of writing we have ever seen in a scientific\r\nperiodical; and although the article appears in the editorial columns of\r\n_Engineering_, we prefer, for the honor of scientific journalism, to\r\nthink that the management of that paper was not party to the rascally\r\nact. It is more credible that a gross imposition has been practiced by\r\nsome trusted member of the _Engineering_ staff, or by some contributor\r\nwhose position seemed to justify the acceptance of his utterances\r\nwithout any attempt at their verification. It is well known here to\r\nwhom, in London, at Mr. Edison's request, Mr. Prescott sent proofs of\r\nthe matter abused, together with electros of the cuts used, in\r\n_Engineering_. Accordingly the burden of dishonor lies upon or between a\r\nprominent British official on the one hand, and on the other a journal\r\nwhich cannot afford to leave the matter unexplained. Whoever is hurt, we\r\nsincerely hope that the fair fame of scientific journalism for candor\r\nand honesty may come off unstained.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      =A More Perfect Production.=\r\n\r\nThe highest skill in manufacture or in production of any kind is not yet\r\nthe prevailing characteristic of American industry. Uniformity of\r\nproduction, of whatever kind, is of much greater importance than to\r\nattempt the manufacture of any grade for which the material or the\r\ntools, the machinery or the knowledge of the workmen is not fitted. The\r\nhighest condition of product in any nation is to produce the finest or\r\nhighest cost articles in the most perfect manner, and to have material\r\nand machinery adopted, and the skilled workmen, so as to be able to so\r\nproduce economically. But until the master hand is satisfied of all the\r\nrequisites for producing fine goods, he should confine production to the\r\nbest his facilities will make in the most perfect, uniform manner.\r\n\r\nSamples of fine goods are shown all over the country every day, and were\r\nconsumers or merchants sure that the product would be the same, there\r\nwould be much less difficulty in introducing and more homemade goods\r\nused where now importations are depended upon. The Stevens crash mills\r\nimport raw flax because it is to be had according to sample, perfectly\r\nclassified, and saves the employment of skilled labor to assort and\r\nclassify, and of purchasing a great deal not wanted. The manufacturers\r\nof edge tools and knives use imported steel because it is warranted and\r\nthe warrant proves good, while the uncertainty of American steel is such\r\nthat a knife will often crack in tempering and cause the loss of labor\r\nworth ten times the difference in the price of the steel. Samples of\r\nalpacas and other dress goods are shown in our jobbing houses fully\r\nequal to any imported goods, but the goods when received are quite often\r\nof various grades and imperfections of character.\r\n\r\nThe imperfect or second quality productions find sale, but at a much\r\nlower price, and are to be found at second rate places, the\r\nimperfections slight and the goods perhaps generally quite as\r\nserviceable, but not absolutely so, and first class houses, catering to\r\nthose who pay highest prices, cannot afford to have any other house\r\ncarry better articles than they do. The use of perfect appliances and\r\nthe best material and the employment of the highest skill are not yet\r\nthe first step and an absolute necessity, as it should be, in America.\r\nThe supply of such machinery, material, and labor can be had if those\r\nwho propose to enter the production of first class articles will insist\r\nupon it, and if such supplies are appreciated by the payment of their\r\nhigher value. The American standard of production is not the highest,\r\nand it can be materially elevated, and while, as at present, too many\r\ncommon articles are supplied, the leading manufacturers should turn to\r\nproducing finer, the finest, and in smaller quantities, to take the\r\nplace of many articles now imported, and to supply the new market which\r\nsuch productions will always create in any country.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    =The Wool Product of the World.=\r\n\r\nFrom an interesting article on the wool trade of the Pacific coast,\r\npublished in a recent number of the San Francisco _Journal of Commerce_,\r\nwe learn that the number of sheep in the world is now estimated at from\r\nfour hundred and eighty-four to six hundred millions, of which the\r\nUnited States has about 36,000,000, and Great Britain the same number.\r\nFrom 1801 to 1875 the wool clip of Great Britain and Ireland increased\r\nfrom 94,000,000 to 325,000,000 pounds. That of France has increased\r\nalmost as rapidly, though the wool is finer, as a rule, and hence the\r\nsuperiority of French cloths. Australia produces nearly as much wool as\r\nthe parent country--Great Britain. The United States product increased\r\nfrom very little at the beginning of the century to about 200,000,000\r\npounds at the present time. Of this California has produced about one\r\nfourth, and the Pacific coast as a whole almost one third. If the ratio\r\nof growth shown in the past prevails in the future, the day is not far\r\ndistant when the Pacific coast will produce at least one half the wool\r\nproduced in the United States, as not only California and Oregon, but\r\nalso Washington, Idaho, Montana, Utah, and New Mexico are well adapted\r\nto its production. The wool clip of Australia is about 284,000,000\r\npounds; that of Buenos Ayres and the river Plata, 222,500,000 pounds;\r\nother countries not previously given, 463,000,000 pounds. The total clip\r\nof the world last year was about 1,497,500,000 pounds, worth\r\n$150,000,000. This when scoured would yield about 852,000,000 pounds of\r\nclean wool.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         =Street Main Joints.=\r\n\r\nAt the annual meeting of the New England Association of Gas Engineers,\r\nMr. Thomas, of Williamsburg, made the following remarks on this subject:\r\n\"In my early experience with the Williamsburg Gaslight Company, with\r\nwhich I became connected in the year 1854, I found pretty nearly all the\r\nstreet mains that were laid were connected with cement joints. While\r\nthere is no doubt in my own mind that a joint can be made perfectly\r\ntight with cement, I much prefer the lead joint. Another thing to be\r\ntaken into consideration to keep tight joints is that the mains should\r\nbe laid a sufficient depth under the surface to protect them from the\r\naction of severe frosts. A great many of the mains were not more than 18\r\ninches or 2 feet below the surface of the streets, and at this depth in\r\nour climate it is a matter of impossibility to keep joints tight, as the\r\naction of the frost in winter will displace the mains and cause the\r\njoints to leak. From the bad manner in which our mains were laid, and\r\nthe cement joints leaking so much, we could not afford to turn gas on\r\nduring the day. Had we done so we should not have had any to supply the\r\ncity at night, and we were thus compelled to shut off the gas just as\r\nsoon as there was any apology for daylight, and keep it shut off as late\r\nas possible in the evening.\r\n\r\n\"With the most careful working in this manner, for a period of nine or\r\ntwelve months, our losses from leakage amounted to about 52 to 55 per\r\ncent of the gas manufactured. A great part of this loss was caused by\r\nthe cement joints leaking, and also a part due to the fact that the\r\nmains were not at sufficient depth under the surface to protect them\r\nfrom the action of the frost. As soon as we possibly could I went over\r\nthe whole of our mains (there was about 17 miles in all), stripping\r\nthem, cutting out the cement, and rejointing them with lead. In one\r\nseason we got the loss from leakage down to 20 per cent, and this with\r\nthe gas turned on during the 24 hours of the day.\r\n\r\n\"One great objection to cement joints is the rigidity of them; in cases\r\nwhere pipes have been disturbed by other excavations and settled, I\r\nfound in all cases that the mains were broken. In a leading main from\r\nour old works, with cement joints, the main, a 10-inch one, was broken\r\nentirely off and fractured lengthwise besides, by the upheaval of the\r\nground from frost. In some of the same mains that we had rejointed with\r\nlead the mains were drawn apart, drawing the lead out, but with very\r\nlittle loss of gas, as the gasket being driven in tight prevented any\r\ngreat leakage. In cases of this kind the lead was easily driven back,\r\nand the joint made perfectly tight again. I have never in our city put\r\nin any street mains that I have not used lead in the joints, and in\r\nlaying mains we always make them gas tight with the gasket used.\r\n\r\n\"At the present time we have over 90 miles of street mains laid, and\r\noutside of our loss from street lamps (we get paid for three foot\r\nburners and they average about 3¼ foot) our loss from leakage will not\r\nexceed 6 per cent. We have suffered severe loss of gas from sewering in\r\nour city. In some cases where there are railroad tracks in the streets,\r\nthe sewers have been run on both sides of the street, alongside and\r\nparallel with our pipes; these excavations are much deeper than our\r\nmains lie, and the earth is always filled in loosely and left to settle.\r\n\r\n\"In cases of this kind, whole blocks of mains were dragged down, the\r\npipe broken, and the joints partially pulled apart; at the same time the\r\nleakage from the joints was not so great, the gasket preventing the\r\nleakage. In laying street mains, what you want particularly to attend\r\nto, and especially in the East here, where you have colder weather than\r\nwe have (we have not seen much winter until we came on here), is to get\r\nthem down under the surface a sufficient depth to protect them from the\r\nfrost. With us the least depth is 2 feet 9 inches under the surface of\r\nthe street, and I am confident, could our mains remain in the ground as\r\nwe put them down, our loss from leakage by them would be very small\r\nindeed. While, as I stated in the beginning, I have no doubt that a\r\ncement joint can be made tight, I can see no benefit in using cement for\r\nthe purpose, as I consider lead far superior in accommodating itself to\r\nany upheaval or settling of the earth where the mains are laid down.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      =Successful Shad Hatching.=\r\n\r\nProfessor J. W. Milner, who has charge of the shad hatching operations\r\nunder the direction of the United States Fish Commissioner, Professor\r\nBaird, is now engaged in the preparation of the report of the work for\r\nthe season just completed. Speaking of the work on the Atlantic\r\nseaboard, and the distribution of young fish, the report says that at\r\nthe Salmon Creek Station, on Albemarle Sound, they obtained 12,730,000\r\neggs, and turned out 3,000,000 young fish. At the Havre de Grace Station\r\n12,230,000 eggs were obtained, and 9,575,000 young fish were turned out.\r\nAbout 6,000,000 young shad have been distributed in the rivers emptying\r\ninto the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico during the season. The distribution\r\nof shad during the past season has been carried on on a much larger\r\nscale than in any previous year, and with great success. The restocking\r\nof the rivers of the Atlantic is only the work of a few years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      =New Use for Lemon Verbena.=\r\n\r\nThe well known fragrant garden favorite, the sweet-scented or lemon\r\nverbena (_Lippia citriodora_), seems to have other qualities to\r\nrecommend it than those of the fragrance for which it is usually\r\ncultivated. The author of a recent work, entitled \"Among the Spanish\r\nPeople,\" describes it as being systematically gathered in Spain, where\r\nit is regarded as a fine stomachic and cordial. It is used either in the\r\nform of a cold decoction, sweetened, or five or six leaves are put into\r\na teacup, and hot tea poured upon them. The author says that the flavor\r\nof the tea thus prepared \"is simply delicious, and no one who has drunk\r\nhis Pekoe with it will ever again drink it without a sprig of lemon\r\nverbena.\" And he further states that if this be used one need \"never\r\nsuffer from flatulence, never be made nervous or old-maidish, never have\r\ncholera, diarrhea, or loss of appetite.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                   =A VELOCIPEDE FEAT EXTRAORDINARY.=\r\n\r\nTwo intrepid velocipedists, M. le Baron Emanuel de Graffenried de\r\nBurgenstein, aged twenty years and six months, and a member of the\r\nSociety of Velocipede Sport, of Paris, has accomplished, with M.

Time was when English workmanship ranked second to none,\r\nand the names of our great manufacturing firms were a guarantee for the\r\nsterling quality of the goods they turned out; but competitions, trades\r\nunions, piece work, short hours, and other incidents of the 'march of\r\nprogress' have altered all that. Complaints, received by hardware\r\nmerchants from their customers abroad, are not confined to the goods of\r\nsecond class firms. Manufacturers who have obtained a world-wide\r\nreputation for their products are frequently convicted of sending out\r\nscamped and unfinished work, and they do not venture to deny the\r\nimpeachment, pleading only that the most vigilant must be sometimes at\r\nfault, and that their men, unfortunately, are not to be depended upon.\r\nIn other cases it is the merchants or their customers who are to blame\r\nfor the inferior quality of the articles by cutting prices so low as to\r\npreclude the possibility of honest work, thinking, probably, that\r\nanything is good enough for a foreign or colonial market. But whatever\r\nthe cause, the fact is now undeniable, that a great deal of the\r\nmanufactured produce shipped from this country of late years has been of\r\na very low standard, and that the American manufacturers have\r\nconsequently had an easy task in beating it.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    =Petroleum Oils as Lubricators.=\r\n\r\nOils from petroleum are now produced suitable for nearly every\r\nmechanical process for which animal oils have heretofore been used, not\r\nexcepting those intended for cylinder purposes. A serious objection\r\nattaching to the animal oils is present in petroleum. If, through the\r\nexhaust steam, some of the oil be carried into the boiler, foaming or\r\npriming is the consequence, but the same thing happening in the case of\r\npetroleum is rather a benefit than otherwise, for it not only does not\r\ncause foaming, but it prevents incrustation or adhesion of the scale or\r\ndeposit, and this aids in the preservation of the boiler, and is perhaps\r\nthe best preventive of the many everywhere suggested.\r\n\r\nOften, in removing the cylinder head and the plate covering the valves\r\nof an engine, we see evidences of corrosion or action on the surfaces,\r\ndiffering entirely from ordinary wear, and the engineer is generally at\r\na loss how to account for it. According to the general impression grease\r\nor animal oil is the preservative of the metal, and is the last thing\r\nsuspected of being the cause of its general disintegration. The reason\r\nof this is that vegetable and animal oils consist of fatty acids, such\r\nas stearic, magaric, oleic, etc. They are combined with glycerin as a\r\nbase, and, under ordinary conditions, are neutrals to metals generally,\r\nand on being applied they keep them from rusting by shielding them from\r\nthe action of air and moisture. But in the course of time the influence\r\nof the air causes decomposition and oxidation, the oils become rancid,\r\nas it is called, which is acid, and they act on the metals. What happens\r\nat the ordinary temperature slowly goes on rapidly in the steam\r\ncylinder, where a new condition is reached. The oils are subjected to\r\nthe heat of high pressure steam, which dissociates or frees these acids\r\nfrom their base, and in this condition they attack the metal and hence\r\ndestroy it.\r\n\r\nThis applies as well to vegetable as to oils of animal origin, fish or\r\nsperm oil included. Petroleum and oils derived therefrom (generally\r\ncalled mineral oils) are entirely free from this objection. Petroleum\r\ncontains no oxygen, and hence it cannot form an acid, and therefore\r\ncannot attack metal. It is entirely neutral, and so bland that it may be\r\nand is used medicinally as a dressing to wounds and badly abraded\r\nsurfaces where cerates of ordinary dressing would give pain.--_Coal\r\nTrade Journal._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              =Influence of Light on Plants and Animals.=\r\n\r\nProfessor Paul Bert, who has recently devoted a great deal of attention\r\nto the study of the influence of light on animals and plants, denies\r\nthat the leaves of the sensitive plant close on the approach of evening,\r\nthe same as if they had been touched by the hand. On the contrary, he\r\nfinds that from 9 in the evening, after drooping, they expand again and\r\nattain the maximum of rigidity at 2 in the morning. What is commonly\r\ncalled the \"sensitiveness\" of plants is but the external manifestations\r\nof the influences of light. Professor Bert placed plants in lanterns of\r\ndifferent colored glass; those under the influence of green glass\r\ndrooped in the course of a few days as completely as if placed in utter\r\ndarkness, proving that green rays are useless, and equal to none at all.\r\nIn a few weeks all plants without exception thus treated died. It has\r\nbeen proved by the experiments of Zimiriareff that the reducing power of\r\nthe green matter of plants is proportionate to the quantity of red rays\r\nabsorbed, and Bert shows that green glass precisely intercepts these\r\ncolored rays, and that plants exist more or less healthily in blue and\r\nviolet rays. In the animal world phenomena of a directly opposite nature\r\nare found, and of a more complex character. Here the light acts on the\r\nskin and the movements of the body, either directly or through the\r\nvisual organs. M. Pouchet has shown the changes in color that certain\r\nanimals undergo, according to the medium in which they live. For\r\ninstance, young turbots resting on white sand assume an ashy tint, but\r\nwhen resting on a black bottom become brown; when deprived of its eyes\r\nthe fish exhibits no change of color in its skin; the phenomenon,\r\ntherefore, seems to be nervous or optical. Professor Bert placed a piece\r\nof paper with a cut design on the back of a sleeping chameleon; on\r\nbringing a lamp near the animal the skin gradually became brown, and on\r\nremoving the paper a well defined image of the pattern appeared. In this\r\ncase the light acted directly, and without nervous intervention. If,\r\nhowever, the eye of the chameleon be extracted, the corresponding side\r\nof the animal becomes insensible to the influence of the light.\r\n\r\nProfessor Bert's conclusion, therefore, is that the circulation in the\r\ntransparent layers of the skin must be affected by light. According to\r\nDr. Bouchard a sunstroke is the effect of the direct action of light\r\nupon the skin, produced by the blue and violet rays. The heat producing\r\nrays have no part in such accidents, as proved by the fact that workmen\r\nexposed to intense heats do not feel their fatal effect. Professor Bert,\r\nin a series of experiments on a variety of animals, found that none\r\navoided light, but all rather sought it; and the lowest forms, like the\r\nhighest, absorbed the same rays. As regards intensity of color, however,\r\nthere was a difference, some being more partial to one ray than another.\r\nThus the microscopic daphne of the pond preferred yellow; violet was\r\nless in request; spiders seemed to enjoy blue rather than red rays--so\r\nresembling people suffering from color blindness. No two persons are\r\nsensible to the same shades or tones, while absorbing the same light;\r\nand this would seem to indicate that the retina possesses a selective\r\npower.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      =New Mechanical Inventions.=\r\n\r\nAn improved Weighing Scale has been patented by Hosea Willard, of\r\nVergennes, Vt. The object of this invention is to economize time in\r\nascertaining the weight of an article by avoiding the necessity for\r\nshifting the poise on the scale beam. It consists in providing a scale\r\nbeam with a number of dishes suspended from different points on said\r\nbeam, and representing or corresponding with different weights, so that\r\nthe weight of an article may be ascertained by placing it in one or more\r\nof said dishes and observing which dish is depressed.\r\n\r\nWilliam John, of Rigdon, Ind., has patented an improved Tire Setting and\r\nCooling Apparatus, by which the tire may be set by one person, easily\r\nand quickly, without burning the fellies, and without straining the\r\nwheel by the unequal cooling of the tire.\r\n\r\nJoseph A. Mumford, of Avondale, Nova Scotia, Canada, has patented an\r\nimproved machine for Sawing and Jointing Shingles. This machine cannot\r\nbe properly described without engravings.

Though of a few things we make or mine too\r\nmuch, our main trouble arises from not producing enough, in variety if\r\nnot in quantity.\r\n\r\n\"The wants of mankind never can be satisfied. Every new means of\r\nsupplying a want creates new wants. They grow by what they feed on. As\r\nlong as humanity is so constituted, over-production, in a general and\r\nenlarged sense, is impossible. It is this impossible thing with which\r\nthe reformers would deal who propose to work fewer hours each day, or\r\nfewer hours in the week. The trouble they deplore does not exist; the\r\nremedy they propose defeats itself. A man cannot get rid of his load by\r\nshifting it from his right hand to his left hand. Production will not be\r\nstopped by making men their own employers certain hours in the day or\r\ncertain days in the week, instead of allowing them to pursue their usual\r\navocations.\r\n\r\n\"The real trouble, which the labor reformers seem incompetent to fathom,\r\nis that there is not enough diversity in employments. What is desired is\r\nmore work in productive enterprises, a more diffused industry, and a\r\ncloser commercial connection with those countries wherein we can make\r\ndesirable exchanges both of our raw material and our manufactured\r\nproducts. Every miner that drops his pick and takes up a hoe, every idle\r\nman that turns himself into an earner of wages, every person that picks\r\nup some loose thread of employment, every capitalist that takes\r\nadvantage of stagnating industry and cheap material to build a house or\r\nbeautify or improve a country seat, or set on foot some new process of\r\nmanufacture, does something toward working out the problem which is\r\npuzzling the economists. In good time the surplus iron and coal will be\r\nsold; new populations will want new railroads; recuperated capital will\r\ngather confidence and take hold of new enterprises, and the whole nation\r\nwill move forward again to more assured prosperity and to vaster\r\nundertakings.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          =Labor in Germany.=\r\n\r\nThe consul at Barmen reports that for agricultural labor the pay varies\r\ngreatly, according to the proximity to or remoteness from manufacturing\r\ncenters; and ranges from fifty-six cents a day in the neighborhood of\r\nBarmen to thirty-one cents a day in the lower Rhine valley, and as low\r\nas eighteen cents in parts of Silesia. At Barmen, Crefeld and\r\nDüsseldorf, carpenters, coppersmiths, plumbers, machinists and\r\nwagonsmiths earn fifty-one to seventy-five cents daily; saddlers and\r\nshoemakers forty-seven to fifty-two cents daily; bakers and brewers,\r\nwith board and lodging, from $1.42 to $2.14 weekly, and without board\r\nfrom sixty cents a day to $4.28 a week; farm hands are paid from $107 to\r\n$215 yearly, with maintenance; railroad laborers from fifty-six to\r\neighty-three cents per day, and as high as ninety-five cents daily for\r\npiece work on tunnels; silk weavers can earn $2.15 to $2.85 a week per\r\nloom; factory women $2.15, and children $1 a week. Business and wages\r\nare very low. In good times wages are eighty per cent higher. The cost\r\nof the necessaries of life has increased some fifty per cent in thirteen\r\nyears, although it is now but little higher than five years ago. A man\r\nand wife with two or three children can live in two or three rooms in a\r\npoor and comfortless manner for $275 a year, and to support such an\r\nestablishment all the members have to work ten or twelve hours daily.\r\nFor a family of six persons the cost is about $7 per week--an amount but\r\nfew families can earn, as the depression of trade and the reduction of\r\ntime allow few to do a full week's work, although wages are nominally a\r\ntrifle higher than five years ago.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        =Petroleum June Review.=\r\n\r\n\r\n                         DRILLING WELL ACCOUNT.\r\n\r\nThe low price of oil and large accumulation of stock in the producing\r\nregions have had the effect to lessen operations in this department\r\nduring the month of June.\r\n\r\nThe total number of drilling wells in all the districts, at the close of\r\nthe month, was 266, which was 110 less than in the preceding month.

This year the water of the river has been\r\nunusually warm and low, and the inflow to the lakes very slight. The\r\nconsequence has been an excessive growth of a conferva which is\r\nindigenous to these lakes and confined to them. This alga, _Nodularia\r\nspumigera_, is very light and floats on the water, except during\r\nbreezes, when it becomes diffused, and being driven to the lee shores,\r\nforms a thick scum like green oil paint.\r\n\r\nThis scum, which is from two to six inches thick, and of a pasty\r\nconsistency, being swallowed by cattle when drinking, acts poisonously\r\nand rapidly causes death. The symptoms of the poisoning are stupor and\r\nunconsciousness, falling and remaining quiet (as if asleep), unless\r\ntouched, when convulsions are induced, the head and neck being drawn\r\nback by a rigid spasm, subsiding before death. The poison causes the\r\ndeath of sheep in from one to six or eight hours; of horses, in from\r\neight to twenty-four hours; of dogs, in from four to five hours; and of\r\npigs in three or four hours. A _post mortem_ shows the plant is rapidly\r\nabsorbed into the circulation, where it must act as a ferment, and\r\ncauses disorganization. As the cattle will not touch the puddle where\r\nthe plant scum has collected and become putrid, all they take is quite\r\nfresh, and the poisoning is therefore not due to drinking a putrescent\r\nfluid full of bacteria, as was suggested.\r\n\r\nWhen the scum collects and dries on the banks it forms a green crust.\r\nWhen, however, it is left in wet pools it rapidly decomposes, emitting a\r\nmost horrible stench, like putrid urine; but previous to reaching this\r\nstage it gives out a smell like that of very rancid butter.\r\n\r\nA blue pigment exudes from this decomposing matter, having some\r\nremarkable properties. It is remarkably fluorescent, being red by\r\nreflected and blue by transmitted light; it appears to be a product of\r\nthe decomposition, and allied to the coloring matter found in some\r\nlichens.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         =ASTRONOMICAL NOTES.=\r\n\r\n                          BY BERLIN H.

A very dark spot much\r\nlarger than a satellite was seen on the eastern edge of the disk, as\r\nshown in the above diagram. It moved rapidly westward along the upper\r\nmargin of the northern belt and passed off at 1 o'clock 24 minutes A.M.\r\n(12th). From its first internal contact till its last external contact\r\nwas just 3h. 19m., Pittsburg time. It appeared to be a solid opaque\r\nbody, truly spherical, very sharply defined, and most intensely black.\r\nThe transit of the satellite occurred at 15 minutes after 11 o'clock,\r\nand had no unusual appearance. Now what was that dark body? We are\r\nconstant observers of the heavenly bodies, though not deeply versed in\r\nthe science of astronomy, and are anxious to know if any one can give us\r\nsome light on the subject. The telescopes used were a 2½ inch and 5 inch\r\nachromatic, magnifying 154 and 216 diameters, but the 154 was chiefly\r\nused.

W. Williston, the assistant of Professor Marsh, has been giving\r\nto the Omaha _Bee_ some interesting facts with regard to the great\r\nreptilian fossils recently discovered in Wyoming and Colorado. The bones\r\nfound represent reptiles of many sizes, from that of a cat up to one\r\nsixty feet high. The latter, found at Como, Wyoming, belonged to the\r\ncrocodile order; but the remains give evidence that the animal stood up\r\non its hind legs, like a kangaroo. Another found in Colorado is\r\nestimated by Professor Marsh to have been 100 feet long. A great many\r\nremains of the same general class, but belonging to different species,\r\nhave been collected and sent East. Among them from three to four hundred\r\nspecimens of the dinosaur, and about a thousand pterodactyls, have been\r\nshipped from Colorado, Wyoming, and Kansas. The wings of one of the\r\nlatter were from thirty to forty feet from tip to tip. Seventeen\r\ndifferent species of these flying dragons have been found in the chalk\r\nof western Kansas. There have also been found six species of toothed\r\nbirds. Comparatively little has been done toward classifying the late\r\nfinds, the task is such an enormous one. Great importance is attached to\r\nthem, however, since nothing of the kind had been found in America until\r\na little over a year ago and great stress had been laid by certain\r\ngeologists on their absence. Another remarkable feature of the discovery\r\nwas that the fossils which had been reported as not existing in this\r\ncountry had hardly been brought to light in one locality before\r\nthousands of tons of them were simultaneously discovered in half a dozen\r\ndifferent places.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      =Trying to Save a Hundred and Fifty Million Dollars a Year.=\r\n\r\nProfessor Riley, recently appointed Government Entomologist and attached\r\nto the Agricultural Department, reports that specimens of insects\r\ninjurious to agriculture are constantly being sent to the department\r\nfrom all parts of the country, with requests for information. In every\r\ninstance, if a proper examination could be made, an effectual remedy\r\ncould be found, and not less than $150,000,000 saved to the country\r\nannually. Recently a worm entirely new to science was sent to the\r\ndepartment by an Iowa farmer, whose orchard of several thousand apple\r\ntrees had been rendered unproductive for several years by the new\r\ndepredator. For the interests of Western fruit growers this insect\r\nshould immediately be investigated. Professor Riley asserts that the\r\n$5,000 recently voted by Congress for the investigation of the cotton\r\nworm, which has sometimes damaged the cotton crop of the South as much\r\nas $20,000,000 in a single fortnight, might have been used to better\r\nadvantage by the department; the salary of the entomologist will use up\r\nall the money, leaving next to nothing for experiments for the\r\neradication of the pest.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        =Industrial Education.=\r\n\r\nAll are agreed that some education is necessary; but what? The great\r\nproportion of those having the direction of our educational system and\r\nfacilities in charge still cling to a system which was established long\r\nbefore the first mechanical operation came into existence. Before the\r\npresent system of man's relation to man, socially, industrially,\r\npolitically, or commercially, was heard of, and notwithstanding the\r\nrevolutions and advancement in all other things, there is a determined\r\nresistance to any attempt at revolution in what shall be considered\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nThere is an effort to establish compulsory education; but what is the\r\nchild to be taught? As if in league with the false theories of the\r\nrights of labor, these efforts take the apprentices from the shops,\r\nforce them away from where they would learn something, and confine them\r\ninside a school house to learn--what? Certainly nothing of the\r\nmaterials, or tools, or pursuits by which they are to obtain their\r\nlivelihood. The child knows nothing of when or by whom the compass was\r\ndiscovered, the printing press, the use of powder, electricity, of\r\nsteam, or of any one of the thousand mechanical operations now\r\ncontrolling every department of life. Does any school boy know how many\r\nkingdoms there are in the natural world, or whether an animal, a\r\nvegetable and a mineral all belong to the same or to different ones?\r\nWill he know that from instinct the young of animals seeks its food and\r\nexpands its lungs, as by the same instinct the root of a seed sucks up\r\nits nourishment from the soil and sends its leaves up to breathe the\r\nair? Will he know anything of the nature or requirements of the soils or\r\nthe plants that grow in them? Will this compulsory education teach the\r\nboy anything of the iron furnace, the foundry or rolling mill, or the\r\nuses or handling of any of their products? Will it teach him anything of\r\nwoods and their value, or for what and how they are useful to man?\r\n\r\nWill this knowledge, for which the powers of the State are to be\r\nrequired to force him to know it--will it teach him anything of the\r\nnature or uses of metals, of metal working, or the business depending\r\nupon them? Will it teach him anything of gold or silver, copper or\r\nbrass? Anything of pottery, of bone, ivory, celluloid, etc.? Will he\r\nlearn anything of hides, leather, or the production of these necessary\r\narticles? Will he know whether the word textile applies to anything but\r\na spider's web or the wing of a butterfly? Whether the United States\r\nmake, import, or grow cotton, wool, silk, flax, and hemp?\r\n\r\nWill he know anything of commerce, railroads, telegraphs, printing, and\r\nthe great number of clerk labors in the larger towns? Will he have\r\nlearned a single thing which will assist him in his work of life? Will\r\nnot every boy thus taken out of the shop and placed at the compulsory\r\nschooling find after he has mastered all it has to give him that he yet\r\nknows nothing; that he must then commence where he was and serve his\r\napprenticeship; that instead of compulsory education his past years have\r\nbeen wasted in obtaining but a compulsory ignorance?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        =Business and Personal.=\r\n\r\n  _The Charge for Insertion under this head is One Dollar a line for\r\n    each insertion; about eight words to a line.

By Charles R. Alder\r\n     Wright. London: Macmillan & Co. 12mo; pp. 191. Price $1.25.\r\n\r\nIn this neat little volume we have the substance of a course of lectures\r\ndelivered at the Royal Institution of Great Britain in 1877, with thirty\r\nor more engraved illustrations of various metallurgical operations. The\r\nauthor discusses briefly, yet with sufficient fullness for popular\r\npurposes, the principal processes for reducing metals from their ores,\r\nthe natural sources of metals, the metallurgy of the different metals,\r\nthe physical properties of metals, and their thermic, electric, and\r\nchemical relations.

P. says: Please inform me of some recipe for removing superfluous\r\nhair. A. Make a strong solution of sulphuret of barium into a paste with\r\npowdered starch. Apply immediately after being mixed and allow to remain\r\nfor ten or fifteen minutes. See also p. 107 (8), vol. 38, and p. 25,\r\ncurrent volume.\r\n\r\n(2) M. A. C. writes: I would like to know how to dissolve bleached\r\nshellac, to make it a cement for stone. A. Dissolve it by digestion in 3\r\nor 4 parts of strong alcohol, or by the aid of ¼ its weight of borax in\r\nabout 4 volumes of boiling water.\r\n\r\n(3) A. K. asks: 1. In rating substances as to hardness, diamond being\r\nNo. 10, how do aluminum, osmium, iridium and steel as used in steel\r\npens, number, also common and tempered glass? A. Aluminum about 3,\r\niridosmine 6.5 to 7, steel 5.5 to 6, glass 5 to 5.5. 2. Can glass 1/32\r\ninch in thickness be ground to angles of 15 per cent or less, and points\r\nas fine as pins, without difficulty, and how? A. No.\r\n\r\n(4) D. C. S. asks for a good recipe for cleaning and polishing dirty and\r\ntarnished brass. A. Dip for a short time in strong hot aqueous solution\r\nof caustic alkali, rinse in water, dip for a few moments in nitric acid\r\ndiluted with an equal volume of water, rinse again, and finish with\r\nwhiting.\r\n\r\n(5) C. J. H. asks for the simplest way of producing a coating of the\r\nmagnetic or black oxide of iron on iron plates 3 feet x 6 feet. I think\r\nit is called the Barff process. A. See pp. 1041 SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN\r\nSUPPLEMENT, and 232, vol. 36, and 4, vol. 37, of the SCIENTIFIC\r\nAMERICAN.\r\n\r\nHow can I make tissue paper impervious to air and water, and yet strong\r\nenough to confine gas? A. You may pass the fabric through a solution of\r\nabout 1 part caoutchouc in 35 parts of carbonic disulphide, exposing it\r\nthen to the air until the solvent has evaporated.\r\n\r\n(6) J. H. J. asks how to use hyposulphite (?) of soda to neutralize\r\nchloride of lime in cotton and linen goods after bleaching the same. A.\r\nAfter washing from it the large excess of the hypochlorite, the fabric\r\nis passed slowly through a solution containing about 10 per cent of the\r\nhyposulphite, and then again thoroughly washed in clean water.\r\n\r\n(7) Columbus asks for a recipe for making ink to rule faint lines, such\r\nas he is now writing on. He wants it to rule unit columns in books. A.\r\nDissolve in a small quantity of warm water 20 parts of Prussian blue by\r\nthe aid of 3 parts of potassium ferrocyanide, and dilute the solution\r\nwith thin gum water until the proper degree of color is obtained.\r\n\r\n(8) A. I. B. asks: Can I add anything to Arnold's writing fluid which\r\nwill cause it to give a good free copy in my letter book? A. Try a\r\nlittle sugar.\r\n\r\n(9) R. & C. ask for information in regard to the process of printing\r\ncopies of drawings made on transparent materials, by using chemically\r\nprepared paper and exposing to the sunlight. A. It is based on the fact\r\nthat an acid in the presence of potassium dichromate strikes a\r\nblackish-green color when brought in contact with aniline. The paper is\r\nprepared by floating it on a bath of aqueous solution of potassium\r\ndichromate and a trace of phosphoric acid, and then drying it in the\r\ndark. Aniline is dissolved in a little alcohol, and the mixed vapors\r\nallowed to come into contact with the sensitive paper that has been\r\nexposed to strong sunlight beneath the drawing, when the portions not\r\nchanged by the sunlight assume the dark color mentioned. All that is\r\nrequisite is that the paper or cloth original should be fairly\r\npenetrable by the light. A piece of paper sensitized as indicated, a\r\nsheet of glass to place over the drawing, and a box in which to place\r\nthe exposed print to the aniline vapor are the only necessary plant.\r\n\r\n(10) P. Y. P. writes: 1. To find the number of acres in a farm of valley\r\nand hillside land, is it by measuring the general contour of the land,\r\nallowing its actual surface, or by measuring and allowing only the\r\nimaginary face of the plane of it? A. The latter is the correct method.\r\n2. Can more grain, say rye, be raised on a farm of valley and hillside\r\nland, as described above, than on a farm having a flat surface, the area\r\nof which is equal to the plane of the former, all other things supposed\r\nto be equal? A. No.\r\n\r\n(11) Inventor asks: 1. Can you tell me of a book on sound boards? A. We\r\ndo not know of a book especially devoted to the subject. 2. Also the\r\nbest kind of wood to make them out of? A. Spruce.\r\n\r\n(12) F. C. A. writes: I wish to construct a bar electro-magnet to go in\r\na cylinder 1 inch in diameter and 1 inch long. 1. What size ought the\r\ncore to be? What number of wire shall I use, and what number of\r\nLéclanché cells shall I use (not to exceed twelve) to obtain the\r\ngreatest possible attractive power, distance 1/10 of an inch? A. Make\r\nthe core 3/8 inch, wind it with No. 24 silk covered wire. Use 6 or 8\r\ncells. 2. In the same space, could a horseshoe magnet be used, with a\r\ngain of power over the bar magnet? A. A cylindrical magnet, which is\r\nsubstantially the same as a horseshoe, might be substituted with\r\nadvantage for the bar magnet.\r\n\r\n(13) W. C. H. writes: In turning a tapering shaft in an engine lathe,\r\nwill the tool if raised above the centers of the lathe turn the taper\r\ntrue from end to end, _i. e._, neither concave nor convex, the taper to\r\nbe made by sliding the tail center the required distance? A. The taper\r\nwill be concave.\r\n\r\n(14) H. E. H. asks how to make lime light. A. The lime light is made by\r\ndirecting the jet of an oxyhydrogen blowpipe against a cylinder of lime.\r\nThe blowpipe is contrived to take the proper proportion of oxygen and\r\nhydrogen gas, and the lime is placed in the reducing focus of the jet.\r\n\r\n(15) L. F. asks: 1. How many Daniell's or Smee's cells would it require\r\nto produce the same effect as 50 Bunsen cells? A. About 100. 2. Is the\r\ndiaphragm equally necessary in Bunsen's, Smee's and Daniell's cells, or\r\ncan it be omitted in any one of them easier than in the others, and why\r\nso? A. The diaphragm or porous cell is required in Daniell's and\r\nBunsen's batteries, but is not used in Smee's. The porous cell is used\r\nonly in two fluid batteries; its object is to allow the current to pass,\r\nbut to prevent the mixture of the two liquids. 3. Is the thickness of\r\nthe zinc of any importance? A. Only that the thicker zinc lasts longer.\r\n4. Which is the cheapest way to produce electric sparks and to charge a\r\nLeyden jar, and what will be the expense? A. By means of a frictional\r\nelectrical machine. The machines cost from $10 upward.\r\n\r\n(16) R. C. K. writes: I am an engineer by trade; have been at it 9\r\nyears. Am out of a position at present and want to learn mechanical\r\ndraughting. How long would it take me to become a good draughtsman by\r\ntaking a special course at some university? And with my knowledge of\r\nengineering and draughting, would my services be likely to be in fair\r\ndemand? A. If you are familiar with mechanical operations, you might\r\nbecome a good draughtsman by close application under a competent\r\ninstructor for one or two years. At present there are many excellent\r\ndraughtsmen looking for positions.\r\n\r\n(17) G. B. M. asks for the cause of the ribs or ridges on the surface of\r\na piece of timber which has passed through a planing machine. A. They\r\nare frequently due to the intermittent motion of the feed.\r\n\r\n(18) A. F. writes: Having a small quantity of gold and gold plated\r\nthings, I would like to know the simplest way to melt it. A. Put it in a\r\nsmall crucible with a little borax and melt in a common kitchen fire.\r\n\r\n(19) J. H. S. writes: I have three drawings each 21 x 30 inches, which I\r\nwish to mount upon cloth like a map, placing them end to end so as to\r\nmake one whole sheet 90 inches long. The drawings are upon heavy Whatman\r\npaper. A. You should stretch wet canvas or factory cloth upon a frame,\r\nand while it is still damp apply paste to the backs of the drawings and\r\nlay them smoothly on the stretched cloth. When the paste becomes\r\nthoroughly dry cut the cloth from the stretching frame and paste a tape\r\nbinding around the edges.\r\n\r\n(20) P. M. asks: What is the difference between the inner and outer\r\nrails of a 10° curve 100 yards in length, gauge 4 feet 8 inches? A. If\r\nthis 100 yards is measured on the center of the curve, whose radius in\r\n                                             R - 2-1/3\r\n feet is R, the length of the inner rail is  --------- X 100, and of the\r\n                                                R\r\n            R + 2-1/3\r\n outer tail --------- X 100.\r\n               R\r\n\r\n(21) W. B. K. asks how to make a shoe dressing for ladies' shoes. A.\r\nSoft water, 1 gallon; extract of logwood, 6 ozs.; dissolve at a\r\ntemperature of about 120° Fah. Soft water, 1 gallon; borax, 6 ozs.;\r\nshellac, 1½ oz.; boil until dissolved. Potassium dichromate, 3/8 oz.;\r\nhot water, ½ pint; dissolve, and add all together. It is preferred to\r\nadd 3 ozs. of strong aqua ammonia to the liquid before bottling.\r\n\r\n(22) J. D. asks: What chemicals can be put into water to increase its\r\nefficiency in extinguishing fire? A. Carbonic acid; sodium carbonate.\r\n\r\n(23) H. P. writes: Please give me the advantages and disadvantages of\r\nsubstituting a galvanized iron tube 18 inches in diameter and 20 feet\r\nhigh for a wood tank, 5 feet wide and 6 deep, as a container of water in\r\na dwelling house in the country. Would the narrower body of water keep\r\nfresh or sweet longer, etc.? Also the thickness of iron necessary to\r\nsafety, and the number of gallons of water this tube would hold. A. The\r\nadvantages are in favor of the wooden tank; zinc lined vessels\r\n(galvanized) are unsuitable for reservoirs for potable water. See p.\r\n369, vol. 36, SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN. 0.3 inch iron would be stout enough.\r\nA pipe of the dimensions specified would contain about 327 gallons when\r\nfull.\r\n\r\n(24) F. L. M. asks: 1. What is the process by which wire is given a\r\ncopper finish? A. Clean the wire by pickling it for a short time in very\r\ndilute sulphuric acid and scouring with sand if necessary. Then pass the\r\nclean wire through a strong bath of copper sulphate dissolved in water.\r\n2. Can wire be thus finished and also annealed? If so, how? A. The wire\r\nshould be annealed first. 3. What other finish can be put on iron wire\r\n(annealed), and by what process? A. Zinc--by passing the clean wire\r\nthrough molten zinc covered with sal ammoniac; tin--by drawing the wire\r\nthrough a bath of molten tin covered with tallow.\r\n\r\nMINERALS, ETC.--Specimens have been received from the following\r\ncorrespondents, and examined, with the results stated:\r\n\r\nJ. H. McF.--A fine quality of kaolin.--F. C. H.--The floury powder\r\nconsists chiefly, if not altogether, of calcium carbonate.--C. L.\r\nG.--They are all silicious limestones. We cannot judge fairly of their\r\nvalue for building purposes from the powders sent.--D. K.--Ferruginous\r\nearth or marl.--A. E.--It is a partially decomposed feldspar. The white\r\npowder is for the most part an impure, silicious, kaolin.--E. H.--It\r\nconsists chiefly of basic carbonate and hydrated oxide of\r\nlead--poisonous.--J. B. V.--It is a fair quality of pipe clay--impure\r\nsilicate of alumina--probably worth about $2 per ton in New York.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       =COMMUNICATIONS RECEIVED.=\r\n\r\nThe Editor of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN acknowledges with much pleasure\r\nthe receipt of original papers and contributions on the following\r\nsubjects:\r\n\r\n  Religion.

The quickest and best way\r\n  to obtain a satisfactory answer, without expense, is to write to us\r\n  (Munn & Co.), describing the invention, with a small sketch. All we\r\n  need is to get the _idea_. Do not use pale ink. Be brief. Send stamps\r\n  for postage. We will immediately answer and inform you whether or\r\n  not your improvement is probably patentable; and if so, give you the\r\n  necessary instructions for further procedure. Our long experience\r\n  enables us to decide quickly. For this advice we make _no charge_.\r\n  All persons who desire to consult us in regard to obtaining patents\r\n  are cordially invited to do so. We shall be happy to see them in\r\n  person at our office, or to advise them by letter. In all cases, they\r\n  may expect from us a careful consideration of their plans, an honest\r\n  opinion, and a prompt reply.\r\n\r\n  _What Security Have I_ that my communication to Munn & Co. will be\r\n  faithfully guarded and remain confidential?\r\n\r\n  _Answer._-You have none except our well-known integrity in this\r\n  respect, based upon a most extensive practice of thirty years'\r\n  standing. Our clients are numbered by hundreds of thousands. They\r\n  are to be found in every town and city in the Union. Please to\r\n  make inquiry about us. Such a thing as the betrayal of a client's\r\n  interests, when committed to our professional care, never has\r\n  occurred, and is not likely to occur. All business and communications\r\n  intrusted to us are kept _secret and confidential_.\r\n\r\n                         Address =MUNN & CO.,=\r\n                 Publishers of the SCIENTIFIC AMERICAN,\r\n                                              =37 Park Row New York.=\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  =Advertisements.=\r\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n  =Inside Page, each insertion - - - 75 cents a line.\r\n  Back Page, each insertion - - - $1.00 a line.=\r\n                       (About eight words to a line.)\r\n\r\n  _Engravings may head advertisements at the same rate per line, by\r\n  measurement, as the letter press.

Messrs.\r\n  Munn & Co. also attend to the preparation of Caveats, Trade Mark\r\n  Regulations, Copyrights for Books, Labels, Reissues, Assignments, and\r\n  Reports on Infringements of Patents. All business intrusted to them\r\n  is done with special care and promptness, on very moderate terms.\r\n\r\n  We send free of charge, on application, a pamphlet containing further\r\n  information about Patents and how to procure them; directions\r\n  concerning Trade Marks, Copyrights, Designs, Patents, Appeals,\r\n  Reissues, Infringements, Assignments, Rejected Cases, Hints on the\r\n  Sale of Patents, etc.\r\n\r\n  =_Foreign Patents._=--We also send, _free of charge_, a Synopsis of\r\n  Foreign Patent Laws, showing the cost and method of securing patents\r\n  in all the principal countries of the world. American inventors\r\n  should bear in mind that, as a general rule, any invention that is\r\n  valuable to the patentee in this country is worth equally as much in\r\n  England and some other foreign countries. Five patents--embracing\r\n  Canadian, English, German, French, and Belgian--will secure to an\r\n  inventor the exclusive monopoly to his discovery among about ONE\r\n  HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLIONS of the most intelligent people in the\r\n  world. The facilities of business and steam communication are such\r\n  that patents can be obtained abroad by our citizens almost as easily\r\n  as at home. The expense to apply for an English patent is $75;\r\n  German, $100; French, $100; Belgian, $100; Canadian, $50.\r\n\r\n  =_Copies of Patents._=--Persons desiring any patent issued from\r\n  1836 to November 26, 1867, can be supplied with official copies at\r\n  reasonable cost, the price depending upon the extent of drawings and\r\n  length of specifications.\r\n\r\n  Any patent issued since November 27, 1867, at which time the Patent\r\n  Office commenced printing the drawings and specifications, may be had\r\n  by remitting to this office $1.\r\n\r\n  A copy of the claims of any patent issued since 1836 will be\r\n  furnished for $1.\r\n\r\n  When ordering copies, please to remit for the same as above, and\r\n  state name of patentee, title of invention, and date of patent.\r\n\r\n  A pamphlet, containing full directions for obtaining United States\r\n  patents sent free.
