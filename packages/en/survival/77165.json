Ye be strangers like?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Was ye never in this town before?”\r\n\r\n“Never.”\r\n\r\n“It’s a fine old town, Shrewsbury. I know it well, every inch the same\r\nas my hand. It’s like ye’ll be wanting to see the——”\r\n\r\n“Can’t you tell us where the Post Office is?”\r\n\r\n“The Post Office! Wouldn’t you now be havin’ your bit packs carried.\r\nYe’ll be _pedestarians_ like.”\r\n\r\n“You are an Irishman like.”\r\n\r\n“I believe it’s in England I am.”\r\n\r\n“But you were born in Ireland?”\r\n\r\n“I just disremember now.”\r\n\r\n“Well, can you tell us which way to the Post Office?”\r\n\r\n“It’s like I might—but, ye see, it’s mighty dryin’ work entirely to be\r\nrememberin’ every thin’ for every body so all the whole time.”\r\n\r\n“What do you want?”\r\n\r\n“A pint’s tupence.”\r\n\r\nTwopence acted on his memory like the spring upon a frozen stream, and\r\nas he walked with us towards the Post Office he told us that he came to\r\nEngland ten years ago—had found work near Liverpool, where he remained\r\nseveral years—then went into Warwickshire, and had, a week ago, come\r\nhither to see his brother, who was engaged on the railway. He said\r\nthat when he was in Warwickshire he had always passed himself off for\r\na Lancashire man, and no one ever _accused_ him of being an Irishman.\r\nHe explained that the local labourers would not let the farmers employ\r\nIrishmen; if they did, they would burn their ricks. When Irishmen were\r\nemployed, it was at very low wages, but he got as good as any. The most\r\nhe ever earned was about three dollars a week at task-work. He had\r\nanother brother who was in America, “in the State of Baltimore,” and he\r\nwas minded to go after him next year.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CAKES AND BRAWN._]\r\n\r\n“Fine old town” it was, Shrewsbury; delightful old town; we\r\nfound our first letters from home there. It is famous, says the\r\nGuide-Book, “for its cakes and brawn.” The former we tasted at the\r\n“Baker-of-Shrewsbury-Cakes-to-Her-Majesty,” for sixpence, with a sight\r\nof the autograph of Lord ——, communicating the appointment, thrown in.\r\nDear at that. The taste is something like, but by no means equal to,\r\nthe _cookies_ we used to eat in country towns on “trainin’ day.” That\r\nthe English, in general, did not know what is good in that line, we had\r\nbefore ascertained, and now discovered that their Queen was equally\r\nunfortunate. Shall advise the princes to “run away.”\r\n\r\n“_Brawn_, the flesh of boar or swine, collared so as to squeeze out\r\nmuch of the fat, boiled and pickled.”—WEBSTER. Our host looked like a\r\n“man of brawn,” but gave us nothing like that.\r\n\r\nShrewsbury was formerly celebrated also for a ridiculous annual\r\nprocession, mummery, masquerade, and play-spell, called “Shrewsbury\r\nShow.” The Puritans put a stop to it, but lately this ancient glory has\r\nbeen attempted to be restored “under the patronage of the mayor and\r\nneighbouring gentry.” The effort, we are told, was entirely successful,\r\nthe “oldest inhabitant” not being able to recall any thing more\r\ncompletely absurd. Our young democratic towns are sometimes equally\r\nfortunate in their civic proceedings without aristocratic assistance.\r\n\r\nWe were much interested in the old houses, of the same general style\r\nas those I described at Chester, but with every conceivable variation\r\nof form, and each with something peculiar to itself, so that we could\r\nnot tire of rambling through the steep narrow streets to study them.\r\nThere are a great many old churches here, too; one remarkable for a\r\nvery light, tall, simply-tapering spire: another, the abbey church, has\r\na great mingling of styles, and in some parts is very rich and elegant.\r\nThere are several curious things about it—an old stone pulpit, battered\r\nstatues, &c. Near it I noticed that some old religious house, that had\r\nbeen once connected with it, had been built upon, roofed over, and\r\nconverted into a brewery. The roofs are universally of flat tiles here;\r\na few miles north they entirely give way to slates.\r\n\r\nOn one of the bridges over the Severn, which here divides into two\r\nsmall streams, between which most of the town is beautifully situated,\r\nwe saw a number of anglers with _curricles_, a light portable boat made\r\nof hide stretched out like an umbrella-top by a wicker frame. It is\r\neasily carried on one arm, and it forms a usual part of the angler’s or\r\nsalmonfisher’s equipment in Wales.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon J. and I walked on to Church Stretton, thirteen miles;\r\nour road, most of the way, through a level valley, with high, naked,\r\nbleak hills on each side. A man joined us who had been most of his\r\nlife a miller, and had lately rented a sheep-walk of sixty-three acres\r\non one of these hill-tops, or, rather, mountain-tops. They are to all\r\nappearance totally barren, except of _gorse_, and he said he could only\r\nstock at the rate of one and a half sheep to the acre.\r\n\r\nI have heard a strange story of the effect of draining on soils of\r\nthis sort. A considerable estate, mainly on the tops of such hills,\r\n(but not in this county,) having come into possession of a gentleman,\r\nhe immediately commenced under-draining it in the most thorough and\r\nexpensive manner. The whole country thought him crazy: “Why! the hills\r\nwere too dry already; the man was throwing away his money;” and his\r\nfriends, in great grief, endeavoured by expostulation and entreaty to\r\nget him off from his ruinous hobby. But he patiently carried it on,\r\nand waited the result; which was, that the increased rental, in a very\r\nshort time, more than paid for the whole outlay, and the actual value\r\nof the land was trebled. (This account I had from a friend of the\r\ngentleman, and, though he could not give me the figures, he assured me,\r\nfrom his personal knowledge of the circumstances, that it was to be\r\nrelied upon.)\r\n\r\nGORSE, (_furze_ or _whins_,) is an evergreen shrub, growing about\r\nthree feet high, rough, thorny, prickly; flourishes in the poorest,\r\ndryest land, where if it gets possession it is extremely difficult\r\nto eradicate. It is sometimes used as a hedge plant, and for that\r\npurpose is planted thickly on high ridges. In some parts of England,\r\nfuel is made of it, and when bruised by powerful machines made for the\r\npurpose, it forms palatable and nutritious food for horses and cattle.\r\nHereabouts, however, we could not learn that it was made of any use, or\r\nregarded otherwise than as a weed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CHURCHYARD LITERATURE._]\r\n\r\nChurch Stretton is a little village mostly made up of inns on the main\r\nstreet. We chose the Stag’s Head, a picturesque, many-gabled cottage,\r\npart of it very old, and, as we were told, formerly a manor-house of\r\nthe Earl of Derby, who spent one night (ever to be remembered!) in it.\r\nIt was close by a curiously-carved church and graveyard. From among a\r\ngreat many “improving” epitaphs, I selected the following as worthy of\r\nmore extended influence.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I.\r\n\r\n                           A “NON SEQUITUR.”\r\n\r\n                                  “Farewell, my wife\r\n                And children dear, in number seven,\r\n                Therefore prepare yourself for Heaven.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\n                            “AN HONEST MAN.”\r\n\r\n              “Erected by the Curate of Church Stretton.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III.\r\n\r\n            “Farewell, vain world, I have seen my last of thee;\r\n            Thy smiles I court not, frowns I fear,\r\n            My cares are past, my head lies quiet here,\r\n            My time was short in this world, my work is done,\r\n            My rest I hope is in another,\r\n            In a quiet grave I lie, near my beloved mother.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV.\r\n\r\n                        “A Friend so true,\r\n                        There is but few,\r\n                        And difficult to find;\r\n                        A man more just,\r\n                        And true to trust,\r\n                        There is not left behind.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V.\r\n\r\n                   “You that are young, behold and see\r\n                   How quickly death hath conquered me,\r\n                   His fatal shaft it was so strong,\r\n                   And cut me off while I was young,\r\n                   But God above, He knew _for why_,\r\n                   That in my youth I was to die.”\r\n\r\nThe following, or something like it, is to be found in almost every\r\nchurchyard in England, often several times repeated.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI.\r\n\r\n                        “Affliction’s sore\r\n                        Long time I bore,\r\n                        Physicians’ aid was vain;\r\n                        Till God did please\r\n                        To give me ease,\r\n                        And free me from my pain.”\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the churchyard were two long rows of cottages\r\nbuilt closely together, and the street between them only nine feet wide.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _AN ENTHUSIASTIC FREE-TRADER._]\r\n\r\nAfter ordering supper, we were shown into a little room where there\r\nwas a fire and newspapers, and two men sitting. One of them was a\r\nyoung, well-dressed farmer, stupid and boozy; the other, a travelling\r\nmercantile agent, very wide awake; both drinking hot slings. The latter\r\nalmost immediately opened conversation, first asking us to join them at\r\ntheir tipple, which we declined.\r\n\r\n“Did you notice the white nag in the stables, gents?”\r\n\r\n“No.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, you should have done so. It’s not every day you’ll see such a\r\nhorse, let me tell you. It would be really worth your while, if I may\r\nbe permitted to advise, to step out and see him. Why! if you’ll believe\r\nme, sir, we gave the stage-coach twenty minutes’ start and beat her two\r\nand a half in eight, besides stopping—how many times?—a go of gin first\r\nand—two of brandy afterwards, wasn’t it, Brom? Yes—we stopped _three\r\ntimes_ and beat her _two and a half in eight_!—’pon my word it’s a\r\nfact, sir!”\r\n\r\n“A remarkable performance.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, sir, if you could but see him now—eating his oats just like a\r\nchild!”\r\n\r\nWe showed no disposition to see this phenomenon, but putting our\r\nknapsacks on the table, had commenced reading the papers, when he again\r\naddressed us, suddenly exclaiming,\r\n\r\n“Hem—wool’s heavy!”\r\n\r\n“What, sir?”\r\n\r\n“Eh—hops scarce?”\r\n\r\n“What?”\r\n\r\n“Sheffil line?”\r\n\r\n“——!” (Stare of perplexity.)\r\n\r\n“Tea?” glancing at our packs.\r\n\r\n“Tea! oh no!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I thought it might be tea you were——Brummagem way?”\r\n\r\n“We are—”\r\n\r\n“Oh! Ah! Good market at Le’m’ster?”\r\n\r\n“We are from New York—travelling merely to see the country; our packs\r\nhave—”\r\n\r\n“Tea?”\r\n\r\n“Only our wearing apparel.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I really thought it must be tea.”\r\n\r\n“No, sir.”\r\n\r\n“From New York? why, that’s in America.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir; we are Americans.”\r\n\r\n“What! Americans, are you? Hallo! why, this is interesting. Brom! I\r\nsay, Brom!—look! do you see? from America; you see? furriners! If you\r\nwill permit me, sir—your very good health, gentlemen. Brom! (damn it,\r\nman,) your _health_—_their_ health.... Now look here! you’ll allow me,\r\nsir—(and he caught my leg,) you brought this, I presume, from New York?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Made there?”\r\n\r\n“Probably.”\r\n\r\n“And the wool?”\r\n\r\n“Very likely from these hills.”\r\n\r\n“Exactly, sir, _exactly_! You see now, Brom—what was I telling\r\nyou?—that’s FREE TRADE, Brom. Most happy to meet you, sir; (wonderfully\r\nintelligent persons, Brom! first-class furriners;) you are welcome\r\nhere, sir; and, gentlemen—(your good health, sir)—and no one to molest\r\nor make you afraid—(won’t you taste the gin? I can recommend it to\r\nyou as a first-rate article)—wandering up and down, seeking what you\r\nmay—eh?—_see_. _Yes, sir_, the _sea_ is the highway of nations—else\r\nwhat is it mentioned in Scripture for? ‘the great sea—to bring nations\r\ntogether—with ships thereon, stretching from Tiberia to Siberias, and\r\nfrom Jericher to,’ eh?—hem—eh?—_somewhere_!”\r\n\r\n“Your tea is ready, gentlemen,” said the waiter; and we hastily took\r\nleave.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTRY CARRIER’S CART.—INDEPENDENT BREAKFAST.—BEAUTY.—OLD INN.—JACK\r\nUP THE CHIMNEY.—BACON AND BREAD.—BEER AND RUM.—LUDLOW.—AN APOSTOLIC\r\nCHURCH.—THE POOR-HOUSE.—_Case_ OF A BROKEN HEART.—REFRESHMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _COUNTRY CARRIER’S CART._]\r\n\r\nWe rose the next morning at daybreak, and walked some miles before\r\nwe saw any body else awake. At the first inn that we found open, we\r\nstopped to breakfast. In front of it was a carrier’s cart—a large,\r\nheavy, hooped-canvas-topped cart, drawn by one horse. As any body who\r\nreads Dickens knows, this kind of rural package-express is a common\r\nthing on the English roads, the carrier taking orders of country people\r\nfor what they need from the towns, and bringing them any parcels they\r\nsend for; taking live freight also when he is not otherwise filled up:\r\nDavid Copperfield, for instance. The representative of “Mr. Barkis” and\r\n“honest John Peerybingle” was in the kitchen of the public house, and\r\nvery glad to see us, pressing us politely to drink from his glass, and\r\nrecommending the ale as the best on the road.\r\n\r\nThe house, however, was of a very humble character; the “good woman”\r\nwas gone to market, and the landlord, though very amiable and desirous\r\nto please, was very stupid and ill provided. He could not even find us\r\nan egg, every thing having been swept off to market. There was some\r\ngood bread, however, which the carrier had just brought, and milk. We\r\nfound a saucepan, cleaned it, and scalded the milk, and, stirring in\r\nthe bread with pepper and salt, soon made a comfortable hot breakfast,\r\ngreatly to the admiration of our host and the carrier.\r\n\r\nFine English weather to-day: gleams of warm red sunshine alternating\r\nwith the slightest possible showers of rain. The country beautiful;\r\nthe road running through a rich, well-watered vale, with the same\r\nhigh, steep hills as yesterday, but now regularly planted with wood to\r\nthe summits. Before us, they fall back, one over another, till they\r\nbecome blue under the thick mists that curl about the tops of the\r\nmost distant, and then, again, blush red before the sun, as the wind\r\nsometimes lifts this veil.\r\n\r\nSeeing a singular ruin a little distance from the road, we went to\r\nvisit it. It had been a castle, with a church or large Gothic chapel\r\nattached. Different parts of it, having received more modern, yet\r\nruinously decayed, timber and _noggin’_ additions, were occupied as\r\nsheep-stables, barn, granary, and workshop. A moat remained about it,\r\nenclosing also a courtyard; and on the opposite side of this from\r\nthe main structure, was a high, four-gabled timber-house, with a\r\ngateway through it, entered across the moat by a bridge, formerly a\r\ndraw-bridge, and with some remains of a portcullis. The woodwork of the\r\ngables, and much of the timber, the heavy brackets and the doorways,\r\nwere covered with quaint carvings.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _RUSTY JACK._]\r\n\r\nAt noon we stopped at a superannuated old stage-coaching house, going\r\nat once to the kitchen, which was a very large room with heavy beams\r\nin the ceiling, from which depended flitches of bacon; a stone floor,\r\na number of oak benches and tables, rows of pewter-mugs hanging about\r\nthe walls, and a great wide fireplace and chimney. A stout, driving\r\nlandlady received our orders; a piece of meat was set to roasting\r\nbefore the fire on the old turnspit, and we were left alone to dry\r\nourselves. Soon we noticed that one end of the spit with the meat was\r\nbeing raised, and we attempted in vain to readjust it. It continued\r\nto rise, and I tried to disconnect the chain by which it was turned,\r\nand which was now drawing it up the chimney; I could not, and still it\r\nrose. I clung to it and tried to stop it, and hallooed for assistance.\r\nIn rushed the landlady, three maids, and a man-servant, and I yielded\r\nthe spit to them; but the power was too strong for them—their united\r\nweight could not long detain it; up it rose—rose—rose, till the\r\nprettiest maid stood first on tiptoe, and then began to scream; then\r\nthe landlady, disengaging the meat from it, and dropping it hastily on\r\na plate, fell back exhausted on one of the oak benches and laughed—oh!\r\nha, ha! oh! ha, ha! ha, ha! ho, ho! ha, ha, ha!—how the woman did\r\nlaugh! As soon as she recovered, she sent the man and maids up to the\r\nmachinery, being too much out of breath to go herself; and in a few\r\nminutes the chain, which had fouled on the rusty crank at the chimney\r\ntop, was unwound and the spit lowered to its place, the joint put on\r\nand set to turning again, all right.\r\n\r\nWhile we were eating our dinner, five young men—labourers—came in\r\nfor theirs; most of them ate nothing but bread and cheese, but some\r\nhad thin slices of bacon cut from the flitch nearest the fire, which\r\nthey themselves toasted with a fork and ate with the bread they had\r\nbrought in their pockets, as soon as it was warmed through. All drank\r\ntwo pints of beer, and, after dining, smoked, except one, who took hot\r\nrum-and-water.\r\n\r\nIt appeared that while three of them preferred to spend their money\r\nfor beer rather than bacon, none of them chose bacon at the expense of\r\nbeer. The man who took rum drank two glasses of it, and the others two\r\nor more pints of beer; but no one who took beer took any rum at all,\r\nnor did he who took rum take any beer. A similar observation I have\r\nfrequently made. The habit of beer-drinking seems to weaken the taste\r\nfor more alcoholic stimulants.\r\n\r\nWe remained about the inn, looking at some pretty model cottages\r\nerected by Lord Clive, until C., who had made a quick walk of nearly\r\nthirty miles to overtake us, arrived, and then walked in to Ludlow.\r\n\r\nLudlow is a neat, pleasant town, beautifully planted in a bight of a\r\nbroad, shallow, musical stream, amongst high, bluffy hills. It has a\r\nruined castle, celebrated in Royal history, parts of which, half hidden\r\nby tall old trees among which it stands, and adorned with ivy, are very\r\npicturesque. There are fine avenues and public walks about it, and\r\njust over the river, which is crossed by two bridges, is a very large\r\ncommon, extending to the top of high and steep hills, which is used\r\nas a public pleasure-ground. In the middle of the town is a venerable\r\nold church, with richly-painted windows and many curious monuments and\r\neffigies of Crusaders and learned doctors sleeping with their wives. In\r\nit I also first saw a beadle in the flesh, and a very funny thing it\r\nwas, in cocked hat, red nose, and laced coat. There are many curious\r\nold houses, particularly one of the inns, (“The Feathers;”) and over\r\nthe Ludford bridge there is a pretty little rural church and a number\r\nof pretty cottages, both ancient and modern, the modern being built in\r\nthe fashion of the timber houses that I described in Cheshire.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _AN APOSTOLIC CHURCH._]\r\n\r\nOur chess-playing friend on the ship had given us a note to a relative\r\nresiding here, and having left it with our card at his house, he\r\nvery soon called upon us. He proved to be a gentleman of education\r\nand refinement, and was extremely kind in his attentions and offers\r\nof service to us. C. had asked with regard to the religious services\r\nwhich would be holden in the town the coming day; after replying to his\r\ninquiries, he remarked that he belonged to a congregation of Christian\r\nBrethren, whose worship he would be gratified if it would be agreeable\r\nfor us to attend. They had no distinct organization, but simply met as\r\na company of believers in Christ, to worship as they were prompted in\r\nthe spirit. They liked to have any one join with them, who loved Jesus\r\nChrist, whatever his theoretical opinions might be.\r\n\r\nIn this way commenced our intercourse with a body of men, who, even if\r\nI thought their opinions most damnable, I could not help remembering\r\nbut with a respect approaching to reverence. During the week that\r\nfollowed we saw many of them in various circumstances, and of very\r\ndifferent education and habits: some were ignorant, unrefined, coarse\r\nof speech, and plainly narrow-minded, fanatical, and bigoted; others\r\nof them were learned men, large-minded, truly humble, charitable,\r\ngenerous, and catholic—and gentlemen, with as much ease of manner,\r\naccomplishment, and polish as I ever met; but in our acquaintance with\r\nthem there was not one that did not seem to be constantly guided by a\r\nspirit of the warmest love for all his fellow-beings, by the liveliest\r\nand ever-working desire to see them happy and growing better.\r\n\r\nThe next morning I breakfasted with this gentleman, and afterwards\r\nattended the meeting of the brotherhood with him and his family. It was\r\nheld in a plain “upper room,” apparently designed for a school-room,\r\nwhich was well filled with people, representing every class, except the\r\naristocratic, in the community, females being slightly preponderant.\r\nThe services were extremely simple,—much like those of a Presbyterian\r\nprayer-meeting, with the addition of a rather lengthy exhortation from\r\none who, I was told, was, like myself, a stranger to the most of those\r\npresent, and concluded with the administration of the communion.\r\n\r\nNothing could be greater than the contrast of the place and its\r\nfurniture, and the style of the exercises, with what I had seen and\r\nheard at the cathedral the previous Sunday; yet J could not but\r\nnotice the marked resemblance between the simple solemnity of manner\r\nand sincere unendeavouring tone of the gentleman who conducted the\r\nceremony of the communion, and that of his robed and titled brother who\r\nperformed the same duty within those aweing walls.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon I went with one of the Brethren to the union\r\npoor-house, which is a little out of the town. The inmates, so far\r\nas I saw them, were nearly all aged persons, cripples, or apparently\r\nhalf-witted, and it all appeared very much like a hospital. The\r\nchilling neatness, bareness, order, and precision, reminded me of the\r\nberth-deck of a man-of-war. Among the sick was a young woman who had\r\nnow for four days refused to take food or to speak; when broth was\r\nset before her in our presence, she merely moaned and shook her head,\r\nclosed her eyes, and sank back upon her bed. Her disease was a broken\r\nheart. A week ago her cottage was destroyed by fire, and her child\r\n(illegitimate) burned to death in it.\r\n\r\nAt sunset we found much such a company strolling on the common\r\nopposite the town as that we saw promenading the walls at Chester last\r\nSunday night. The shaded walks about the castle were also thick with\r\nhappy-looking, grateful-looking, orderly men and women, boys and girls,\r\nsuperabundantly attended by healthy, sturdily-tottering babies.\r\n\r\nIn the evening C. called on the Independent clergyman. He spoke\r\nhighly of the spiritual character of the Brethren, but he evidently\r\nregarded them as rather wild and untractable abstractionists. They had\r\ndrawn away several of the leading members of his flock, and, in his\r\nobservations upon them, he possibly showed a little soreness on this\r\naccount. He continued on terms of friendly intercourse, however, with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n      PHYSICAL EDUCATION.—A RUSTIC VILLAGE.—FARM-HOUSE KITCHEN.—AN\r\n       ORCHARD.—STABLES.—LEOMINSTER.—A TROUT BROOK.—FRUIT CULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                    _Monday, June 10th._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A FARM-HOUSE KITCHEN._]\r\n\r\nAfter breakfasting with the Independent minister, (the term clergyman\r\nis never applied in England except to those of the established church,)\r\nhe walked with us for six miles out of town upon our road. Three little\r\nboys and girls, the youngest six years old, also accompanied us. They\r\nwere romping and rambling about all the while, and their morning’s walk\r\nmust have been as much as fifteen miles; but they thought nothing of\r\nit, and, when we parted, were apparently as fresh as when they started,\r\nand very loath to return.\r\n\r\nAfter looking at several objects of interest near the road, we were\r\ntaken by a narrow, crooked lane to a small hamlet of picturesque\r\nold cottages, in one of which a farmer lived who was a parishioner\r\nof our friend’s. It was a very pretty, many-gabled, thatched-roofed\r\ntimber-house, almost completely covered with vines and creepers. We\r\nwere sorry to find the farmer not at home; his wife, an elderly,\r\nsimple-minded dame, received us joyfully, however. In entering the\r\nhouse, as we have noticed to be usual in old buildings, whatever\r\ntheir purpose, we found that the stone floor of the narrow hall was a\r\nstep below the street and general surface of the ground outside. The\r\nkitchen, to which we were at once conducted, was a large square room,\r\nlighted by a single broad window, and having a brilliant display of\r\npolished metal utensils upon and about a great chimney, all as neat and\r\nnice as a parlour.\r\n\r\n                “The huge oak table’s massy frame\r\n                Bestrode the kitchen floor;”\r\n\r\na linen cloth was spread upon it, and coarse but excellent wheat bread,\r\nbutter, and cheese, brought from the pantry, and cider and perry from\r\nthe cellar. The cider was “hard” enough; the perry, (fermented juice\r\nof pears,) a beautiful, bright, golden liquid, tasted much like weak\r\nvinegar and water. We had entered the district of cider and apple\r\ntrees, for these liquors were home-made, and the first extensive\r\norchard that we have seen adjoined the rear of the house: during the\r\nrest of our day’s walk the road was frequently lined with them for long\r\ndistances.\r\n\r\nThe trees, in a considerable part of this orchard, were of every age,\r\nand stood very irregularly at various distances from each other. It\r\nappeared as if when an old tree was blown down, or became worthless\r\nfrom age and decay, and an unshaded space was thus left, or likely to\r\nbe, two young trees were planted at a little distance on each side\r\nof it, and thus perhaps the orchard had been renovated and continued\r\non the same ground for several generations. Two hundred years ago it\r\nwas considered that “the best way to plant an orchard is to set some\r\nkernels of the best and soundest apples and pears, a finger deep, and\r\nat a foot distance, and to leave the likeliest plants only in the\r\nnatural place, removing the others only as time and occasion shall\r\nrequire.” The orchards of the Rhine, at the present day, in which\r\napple, pear, cherry, and nut-trees are intermingled, seem to have been\r\nplanted with as little regard to regularity of distance. The grafts\r\nwere commonly inserted at from six to eight feet from the ground,\r\nand the limbs trimmed so as to allow free passage to cattle beneath\r\nthem. The land was in an old weedy sward, and was pastured by horses\r\nand cows. It had not been in any way drained, and was in some parts\r\nboggy. In these, willows, and sallows or osiers, (basket willows,) were\r\ngrowing. The trees all appeared to me unhealthy, mossy, and stunted. A\r\nfew pear trees grew here and there, indiscriminately, among the apples.\r\nThe cider-mill was just like the old-fashioned ones, with a stone\r\nwheel, common in New England.\r\n\r\nAfter seeing the orchard in such condition, I was surprised to find\r\nexcellent, neat, and well-ordered stables. The horse-stalls were large,\r\nwith iron racks and mangers, and a grating and drain to carry off the\r\nliquid. The manure in the yard was piled up in a large, oblong heap,\r\ncovered with earth, to prevent evaporation, with a space of clean\r\npavement, wide enough for a cart to pass all around it. The liquid\r\noverflow of the yard was conducted off by a drain, so as to flow over\r\nthe orchard pasture.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe reached Leominster at noon, after a few miles further of walking\r\nthrough a pleasant country, remarkable for its pretty old cottages. At\r\nLeominster, (pronounced _Leminster_,) there are also more than usually\r\nquaint old houses, grotesquely carved; and on the market-house, an odd\r\nold building, there are some singular inscriptions. I recollect only\r\none, which runs in this way: “_As columnes do pprope up_” a house, so\r\ndo a gentry support a state.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A TROUT BROOK._]\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon we walked for some distance on the banks of a trout\r\nbrook, in which a good many ladies and gentlemen were angling, with but\r\npoor success. The trout were small, and, if I recollect rightly, rather\r\nlighter coloured than ours, and not so prettily mottled. Some of the\r\nanglers called the stream “the Arrow,” and some “the Harrow,” and I do\r\nnot now remember which way it is printed on the map.\r\n\r\nThe field-bean is a common crop here; it is now in blossom, and a\r\npeculiarly sweet scent from it, every now and then, comes in a full,\r\ndelicious flood over the hedges.\r\n\r\nThe country over which we walked in the afternoon, between Leominster\r\nand Hereford, was in some parts extremely beautiful: considerable\r\nhills, always, when too steep or rocky or sterile for easy cultivation,\r\ncovered with plantations of trees; the lesser hills and low lands\r\nshaded by frequent orchards. These were generally of apples, sometimes\r\nwith pears intermixed—somewhat rarely entirely of pears. Many of them\r\nappeared much like the one I have described, and occasionally there was\r\na regularly planted one of fine, thrifty trees. In the poorer orchards,\r\nwhere the trees were of all ages, they frequently were planted not\r\nmore than fifteen feet apart, and when so, as far as I observed, were\r\ninvariably small in size and unhealthy. In the better ones, the trees\r\nstood oftenest thirty feet apart one way, and twenty another; rarely at\r\nmuch greater distance than this, but sometimes as much as forty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH ORCHARD DISTRICTS.—THE MOST FAVOURABLE SOILS AND\r\nCLIMATE.—LIME.—PRACTICAL DEDUCTION.—DISEASES.—PREVENTION AND\r\nREMEDIES.—SUGGESTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ENGLISH ORCHARD DISTRICTS._]\r\n\r\nThere are but few orchards in England, except in certain districts,\r\nand in these they abound, and are often very extensive. The inquiry\r\nnaturally arises, What has given those districts their distinction in\r\nthis respect? Have they any natural advantages which makes orcharding\r\nmore profitable in them than in other parts of the country? In\r\nreply, I learn, that the orchard districts are all distinguished for\r\na comparatively mild climate. They are nearly all in the south and\r\nsouth-western counties, while in the northern and eastern counties I do\r\nnot know of any. Hereford is a somewhat hilly county, and, as I have\r\nremarked, where the hills are too steep for easy cultivation, it is\r\nusual to plant orchards; but the south side of such hills is preferred\r\nto the north, and, even here, a crop is sometimes entirely lost by a\r\nlate and severe spring frost. A south-east slope is preferred, the\r\nsouth-east winds being the driest. I suspect another reason why it\r\nis found better is, that the south-west winds, coming off the ocean,\r\nare the stronger. My own observation has led me to think that the\r\napple-tree is much affected by an exposure to severe winds. Most sorts\r\nof trees do not thrive very well upon the sea-shore, and this is\r\nusually laid to the account of salt spray or “salt in the air.” It will\r\nbe found, however, that trees grown inland upon very exposed sites,\r\nhave the same peculiarities with those in the vicinity of the sea; that\r\nis, they are slow of growth and _scrubby_.\r\n\r\nAnother important circumstance to be noticed, as distinguishing the\r\napple districts, is in the nature of their soils. These are found,\r\nhowever varying otherwise, invariably to have a large proportion of\r\nlime, and generally of potash, in their chemical composition. With\r\nreference to this I quote the observations of Mr. Frederick Falkner.[1]\r\n\r\n[1] Journal of the Royal Agricultural Society, vol. iv. p. 881.\r\n\r\n  “Great light has been lately thrown upon the adaptation of soils\r\n  to particular plants, and it is now easy to account for the\r\n  predilection, so to speak, of the apple-tree for soils that abound\r\n  in clays and marls. All deciduous trees require a considerable\r\n  proportion of potash for the elaboration of their juices in the\r\n  leaves, and are prosperous, or otherwise, in proportion to the\r\n  plentiful or scanty supply of that substance in the soil. Liebig\r\n  has shown, that the acids generated in plants are always in union\r\n  with alkaline or earthy bases, and cannot be produced without\r\n  their presence.... Now the apple-tree, during its development,\r\n  produces a great quantity of acid; and therefore, in a corresponding\r\n  degree, requires alkaline, and, probably, earthy bases also, as an\r\n  indispensable condition to the existence of the fruit.”\r\n\r\nAgain, the same writer:\r\n\r\n  “It cannot be denied that ammonia, and also the humus of decaying\r\n  dung, must have some influence on the growth of the tree in such\r\n  soils, and also in the development of the fruit; but it is most\r\n  certain, at the same time, that these alone would be perfectly\r\n  inefficient for the production of the fruit without the co-operation\r\n  of (the alkaline bases.) The size, and perhaps the flavour of the\r\n  fruit, may be somewhat affected by the organic part of the manure,\r\n  but its very existence depends upon the presence in the soil of a\r\n  sufficient quantity of those inorganic or mineral substances which\r\n  are indispensable to the formation of acids.”\r\n\r\nBut it is also found by analysis that lime enters into the composition\r\nof the _wood_ of the apple-tree in very large proportions. By the\r\nanalysis of Fresenius, the ash of the wood of the apple contains 45.19\r\nper cent. of lime and 13.67 per cent. of potash. By the analysis of Dr.\r\nEmmons, of Albany, N. Y., the ash of the sap-wood of the apple contains\r\nof lime 18.63 per cent. and 17.50 per cent. of phosphate of lime.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE MOST FAVOURABLE SOILS AND CLIMATE._]\r\n\r\nBut it is not wherever soils of the sort I have described (calcareous\r\nsandstones and marly clays) abound in a district, that you find that\r\nthe farmers have discovered that it is for their interest to have\r\norchards; nor are they common in all the milder latitudes of England;\r\nbut _wherever_ you find a favourable climate, _conjoined with_ a\r\nstrongly calcareous and moderately aluminous soil of a sufficient\r\ndepth, there you will find that for centuries the apple-tree has\r\nbeen extensively cultivated. Evelyn speaks, 1676, of the apples of\r\nHerefordshire and says there were then 50,000 hogsheads of cider\r\nproduced in that county yearly. The ancient capital of modern\r\nSomersetshire, one of the present “Cider Counties,” was known by the\r\nRomans as Avallonia, (the town of the apple orchards.) It would not be\r\nunlikely that the universal ceremony in Devonshire, of “shooting at the\r\napple-tree,” (hereafter described,) originated in some heathen rite of\r\nits ancient orchardists.\r\n\r\nTo obtain choice dessert fruit, the apple in England is every where\r\ntrained on walls, and in the colder parts it is usual to screen a\r\nstandard orchard on the north by a plantation of firs. There is no\r\npart of the United States where the natural summer is not long enough\r\nfor most varieties of the apple to perfect their fruit. In Maine, and\r\nthe north of New Hampshire and Vermont, the assortment of varieties\r\nis rather more limited than elsewhere, I believe; but I have eaten a\r\nbetter apple from an orchard at Burlington, Vermont, than was ever\r\ngrown even in the south of England. We may congratulate ourselves\r\nthen, that all that we need to raise the best apples in the world,\r\nany where in the northern United States, is fortunately to be procured\r\nmuch more cheaply than a long summer would be, if that were wanting.\r\nThe other thing needful, judging from the experience of England for a\r\nlength of time past record, in addition to the usual requisites for\r\nthe cultivation of ordinary farm crops, is abundance of lime. This is\r\nexperience; and science confirms it with two very satisfactory reasons:\r\nfirst, that apple-tree wood is made up in a large part of lime, which\r\nmust be taken from the soil; and, second, that before the apple-tree\r\ncan turn other materials which it may collect from the soil and\r\natmosphere into fruit, it must be furnished with a considerable amount\r\nof some sort of alkali, which requisite may be supplied by lime.\r\n\r\nThere is but little else that we can learn from the English\r\norchardists, except what to avoid of their practices. The cider\r\norchards, in general, are in every way miserably managed, and the\r\ngreater number of those that I saw in Herefordshire were, in almost\r\nevery respect, worse than the worst I ever saw in New England. The\r\napple in England is more subject to disease; and I should judge, from\r\nwhat was told me, that in a course of years it suffered more from the\r\nattacks of insects and worms than in America. The most deplorable\r\ndisease is canker. This malady is attributed sometimes to a “cold,\r\nsour” soil, sometimes to the want of some ingredients in the soil that\r\nare necessary to enable the tree to carry on its healthy functions,\r\nsometimes to the general barrenness of the soil, and sometimes to the\r\n“_wearing out of varieties_.” The precaution and remedies used by\r\ngardeners (rarely by orchardists) for it, are generally those that\r\nwould secure or restore a vigorous growth to a tree. The first of these\r\nis deepening and drying the soil, or deep draining and trenching. The\r\nstrongest and most fruitful orchards, it is well known, are those which\r\nhave been planted upon old hop-grounds, where the soil has been deeply\r\ntilled and manured for a series of years with substances that contain a\r\nconsiderable amount of phosphorus, such as woollen rags and bones. The\r\nroots of the hop also descend far below the deepest tillage that can\r\nbe given it; (in a calcareous gravelly subsoil they have been traced\r\nten feet from the surface;) a kind of subsoiling is thus prepared for\r\nthe apple by the decay of the hop roots. In some parts it is the custom\r\nto introduce the hop culture upon the planting of a young orchard, the\r\nhops occupying the intervals until the branches of the trees interfere\r\nwith them. Nothing is more likely than this to ensure a rapid and\r\nhealthy growth of the trees.\r\n\r\nI recommend to those who intend planting an orchard, to have the ground\r\nfor it in a state of even, deep, fine tilth beforehand, and to plant\r\nin the intervals between apple or pear trees some crop, which, like\r\nhops, will be likely to get for itself good feeding and culture for\r\nseveral years. Peach-trees, and dwarf apples (on douçain stocks) and\r\npears (on quince stocks), answer very well for this, and will make a\r\nhandsome return some years before the standard apples and pears come\r\ninto bearing.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE MOST FAVOURABLE SOILS AND CLIMATE._]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the richness of the soil, however, it is said that\r\n“although high and _exciting_ modes of cultivation may flatter for a\r\nwhile by specious appearances, it is a grave consideration whether they\r\ndo not carry serious evils in their train.” This caution will remind\r\nthe American horticulturist of Mr. Downing’s recommendation to those\r\nplanting orchards on the _over-deep and rich_ Western alluvial soils,\r\nto set the trees upon hillocks. The danger apprehended is in both cases\r\nthe same, that of too succulent growth. Mr. Williams, of Pitmaston, a\r\ndistinguished English horticulturist, has found deficient ripeness of\r\nthe young wood to be the prime predisposing cause of the canker. He\r\nrecommends every year the shortening in of each shoot of the young\r\nunripened wood, which he says will preserve trees of old “worn out”\r\nvarieties, as “perfectly free from canker as those of any new variety.”\r\n\r\nAn impenetrable bottom of stone, at not more than three feet from the\r\nsurface, is frequently made as a precaution against canker. I have\r\nbeen told that in the ancient orchards attached to monasteries, such a\r\nflagging of brick or stone is often found under the whole area of the\r\norchard. This would seem at first sight to be directly opposed to the\r\nother precaution, of thorough-draining and deepening the surface soil;\r\nbut it may be considered that the injury which stagnant water would\r\neffect is in a degree counteracted when the roots do not descend below\r\nthe influence of the atmosphere and the heat of the sun. It is not\r\nunlikely that these influences would extend to a depth of three feet\r\nfrom the surface, in a soil that had been so thoroughly trenched and\r\nlightened up as it necessarily must be to allow of a paving to be made\r\nunder it. The paving does not probably much retard the natural descent\r\nof water from the surface, nor does it interfere with its capillary\r\nascent; the trenching makes the descent of superabundant water from the\r\nsurface _more_ rapid, while the increased porosity of the trenched soil\r\ngives it increased power of absorption, both from the subsoil and the\r\natmosphere, as well as of retention of a healthy supply of moisture.\r\nThe paving also prevents the roots from descending below where this\r\nmost favourable condition of the soil has been made to exist. The\r\neffect would doubtless be greatly better if thorough-draining were\r\ngiven in addition; but so far as it goes, the under-paving and\r\ntrenching is calculated to effect the same purpose as deep drainage: to\r\nsecure a healthy supply of heat, light, and moisture to all the roots.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the precautions and remedies which have been found\r\nof service against canker, whether operations upon the roots or the\r\nfoliage, are all such as are calculated to establish or replace the\r\ntree in circumstances favourable to its general thriving, healthy\r\ncondition.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SUGGESTIONS._]\r\n\r\nThis suggests the idea that canker may be the result of a general\r\nconstitutional debility of the tree, not occasioned by any one cause\r\nor set of causes, but resultant from all and any circumstances\r\nunfavourable to the healthy growth of a tree; and it is a question\r\nwhether the same may not be thought of the peculiar diseases of other\r\ntrees, the peach, the pear, the plum, the sycamore, and perhaps even of\r\nthe rot of the potato.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECAY OF VARIETIES.—TWO THEORIES: KNIGHT’S, DOWNING’S.—ENGLISH THEORY\r\nAND PRACTICE.—PRACTICAL DEDUCTIONS.—CAUSES OF DECAY.—REMEDIES.—HINTS\r\nTO ORCHARDISTS.—SPECIAL MANURES.—PRUNING.—THOROUGH DRAINAGE.—A\r\nSATIRICAL SKETCH.—SHOOTING THE APPLE-TREE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is known that many varieties of apples, which fifty years ago were\r\nheld in high esteem as healthy, hardy sorts, bearing abundantly very\r\nsuperior fruit, have now but a very poor reputation, and varieties\r\nwhich a hundred years ago were highly valued and extensively\r\ncultivated, are now extinct. It is believed, too, that the most\r\ncelebrated old varieties that are yet cultivated, are much more\r\nsubject to canker than others; or, in other words, that trees of these\r\nvarieties are more easily affected by unfavourable circumstances, or\r\nhave a more delicate constitution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _VARIOUS THEORIES._]\r\n\r\nTo account for this, there are two theories held by different\r\nscientific horticulturists. The first—which originated with the late\r\nMr. Knight, a distinguished vegetable physiologist of England, who\r\ndevoted much attention to the subject, and made a long series of\r\nexperiments upon it—may be stated as follows:\r\n\r\nEach seedling tree has a natural limit to its life, and within that\r\nwill have a period of vigour, succeeded by a natural and inevitable\r\ndecline, corresponding to the gradually increasing feebleness which\r\nattends the latter part of the natural life of a man. And all trees\r\nalso which have been propagated from such a seedling by means of buds\r\nor grafts, or, in other words, all trees of the same variety, are to\r\nbe considered as merely extensions of that seedling, and will have\r\na cotemporary vigour and decline and decease with it. The period of\r\nvigour or decline may be much extended by circumstances favourable\r\nto the general health of any particular tree, and by unfavourable\r\ninfluences it may be shortened: but however well situated, sooner or\r\nlater it will manifest feebleness by the change in the quality of its\r\nfruit, the small quantity it is able to bear, by the decay of branches,\r\nand especially by its liability to be attacked by diseases, such as the\r\ncanker, which rapidly destroy its remaining vitality. These diseases\r\nmay be guarded against, and may often be cured; but the longer the\r\nperiod since the origin of the variety from a seed, the greater the\r\nliability and the more difficult the cure.[2]\r\n\r\n[2] Professor Turner, of Illinois College, advocates the view that\r\nevery time a seedling tree is divided, whether in root or top, its\r\nnatural longevity and proportionate vital force are proportionally\r\ndivided, abstracted, and shortened; and believes that some of the\r\nworst forms of hereditary, and also of annual diseases, flow from a\r\nsuccession of such mutilations through a series of generations, or are\r\nproduced by an effort of nature to resist and repair this interference\r\nwith her natural processes.\r\n\r\nThis theory is entirely discredited by other distinguished botanists\r\nand horticulturists, among whom are Dr. Lindley in England, Decandolle\r\non the Continent, and Mr. Downing and H. W. Beecher in America.\r\n\r\nThese consider that there is no such similarity between the life of\r\na tree and the life of an animal, and that a bud and a seed contain\r\nequally the germ of new life, that they are, in fact, the same\r\nthing, except that they are prepared to be developed under different\r\ncircumstances. That each bud, twig, and branch, has a life of its own,\r\nand the trunk is but an association of roots, or of connections between\r\neach bud and its roots. It may be separated from this trunk as a seed\r\nis, and will continue to live if ingrafted upon another trunk, where\r\nit will connect itself again with the ground and grow, and through\r\nit other independent lives will be produced and sustained. Or it may\r\nbe removed from its parent and placed upon the ground, where it will\r\nmake roots and extend and reproduce again as independently, in all\r\nrespects, as a seed. It is held that the death of trees does not arise\r\nfrom any natural period being assigned to their existence, but that the\r\ntissues of a tree, as they grow old, become dry and hard; no longer\r\ntransmit sap, lose their vitality and gradually decay; yet the process\r\nof growth may continually be renewed exteriorly to this death, so that\r\nlarge cavities will often exist in the interior of trees. As, however,\r\nthe peculiar natural food of the tree within the limits to which\r\nit can extend its roots, becomes exhausted, or, as other unhealthy\r\ncircumstances affect it, its vital power and its re-vitalizing power\r\nwill be diminished, and finally may become extinct.\r\n\r\nIf, however, a bud or germ of a new branch can be taken from the tree\r\nbefore its decay, or from any part of it that yet retains its vigour\r\nand health, and be transplanted by means of cuttings in the earth, or\r\ninoculations or grafts upon another healthy stock of the same species,\r\nit will have all the vital energy, and, in every respect, all the\r\nnatural character, of a seedling.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SCROFULOUS TREES._]\r\n\r\nIn explanation of the general deterioration of certain favourite old\r\nvarieties, according to the theory of Downing and Lindley, their state\r\nshould be compared (taking care not to run the analogy too far into the\r\nground) to what is popularly understood as a _scrofulous_ condition of\r\nhuman beings, rather than to the decrepitude of old age. From various\r\ncauses—want of proper food, unfavourable climate, propagation upon\r\nunhealthy stocks, high feeding, and any unnatural stimulus producing\r\nimperfect succulent growth, and from constant repropagation from\r\ntrees that have in a greater or less degree so suffered—the trees of\r\nthe variety have very generally lost their natural, strong, active,\r\nresisting, and recuperative vital energy, and have a general tendency\r\nto disease, which will be developed in different forms according to\r\ncircumstances. A wound upon a scrofulous subject is more difficult to\r\nheal; exertion produces more fatigue, and rest brings less return of\r\nstrength. Food, which in its natural state would be most nourishing and\r\nhealthful, it can no longer digest, and it does it more harm than good;\r\nexposure to cold, to malaria, or contagion, is more dangerous, and if\r\nit escapes all acute disease it gradually grows more and more feeble\r\nuntil finally it has “died of a decline.”\r\n\r\nSterility attends the decrepitude of age, but not the scrofulous\r\ndebility in man, neither does it the degeneracy of the old trees. But\r\nthe scrofulous habit is hereditary in man; so it is believed to be\r\nin the old varieties. If, however, the scrofulous inheritance is not\r\nvery virulent, by a judicious course of regimen it may be gradually\r\novercome, and a strong vigorous constitution once more re-established.\r\nSo it is argued, and facts are cited that seem to sustain the position,\r\nmay the old varieties be restored to their pristine excellence, by\r\ncare to select scions from the most healthy trees, and from the\r\nmost vigorous parts of them, and to propagate these under the most\r\nfavourable circumstance for their healthy growth.\r\n\r\nThe predisposition to disease in these ill-treated trees _may_ result\r\nin a contagious malady, and this may spread beyond them and attack\r\ntrees of ordinarily good constitution, and in the most salubrious\r\nsituations, though, of course, the liability of these to take the\r\nmalady, and their recuperative power under its attack, will be\r\nproportionate to their strength and soundness. The disease known as\r\nthe yellows, in peach-trees, seems to be of this nature.\r\n\r\nThere are many facts unfavourable to both these theories, and many\r\nphenomena which neither of them, in my opinion, satisfactorily explain.\r\nThe popular judgment in England seemed to have accepted Knight’s\r\nhypothesis. But while every body was mourning over the degeneracy of\r\nold favourites, the utter neglect or miserable mismanagement of their\r\norchards seemed to me to bear strong testimony to the correctness of\r\nthe contrary theory.\r\n\r\nThe practical deduction, it may be remarked, from either view, does\r\nnot greatly differ. By judicious management, the health, vigour, and\r\nprofit of a fruit-tree, which would otherwise, after a certain time,\r\npine away and die, may be greatly extended, if not made permanent;\r\nand trees which are already failing from decrepitude or disease, may\r\nbe restored. On the other hand, if trees are planted in unhealthy\r\npositions, insufficiently supplied with those materials that are\r\nnecessary to the formation of strong, compact wood; if they are cruelly\r\nmutilated, crowded too close together, &c., they will not only be\r\nfeeble and unproductive, but will be particularly liable to the attacks\r\nof vermin, disease, and parasites, and, in their weak condition, will\r\nsoon yield their life to these enemies. Moreover, the insects which are\r\nbred in them will extend their ravages to surrounding trees, the seeds\r\nfrom their parasites will be scattered over the neighbourhood, and the\r\ndisease which is generated in them may be indefinitely extended among\r\ntheir species.\r\n\r\nThe most common causes of disease, decay, and decline of a fruit-tree,\r\nwhich it is in the power of the orchardist, in a great degree, to\r\ncontrol, are these: the exhaustion from the soil of those materials\r\nwhich are its necessary food; the attacks of vermin, and the growth of\r\nmoss or parasites; the loss of large limbs or other severe wounds;\r\ntoo great exposure of the trunks to the sun; too rapid and succulent\r\ngrowth from the stimulus of heat or exciting manures; and an impervious\r\nsubsoil, which will allow water frequently to stagnate about its roots,\r\nproducing what is commonly called by farmers “a cold, sour soil.”\r\n\r\nSome of my readers, who have not studied the subject, may be glad to\r\nhave me concisely indicate the most approved means of avoiding or\r\ncounteracting these dangers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SPECIAL MANURES._]\r\n\r\nManures should be applied to orchards frequently and in moderate\r\nquantities, rather than in heavy supplies at distant intervals; and, to\r\navoid unhealthy stimulation, they should be well decomposed. The best\r\nordinary manure in the United States has been found to be a mixture of\r\ndung with an equal quantity of peat or black swamp-earth, chip-dirt,\r\nor rotten wood or leaves; and it is better that this compost should be\r\nmixed some time (the longer the better) before it is applied.\r\n\r\nBut, in addition, I have shown from the English experience that the\r\napple-tree requires a more than ordinary supply of lime, (say a peck\r\nof air-slaked stone or shell lime to each tree, every year.) In the\r\nsame way the pear is known to require especially potash, iron, and\r\nphosphorus.\r\n\r\nIron is found in sufficient quantity in most clay soils; where needed\r\nit may be supplied by scattering bog-ore, (found generally underlying\r\nswamps in America,) or iron filings, or the sweepings and scoriæ from\r\nforges. One pound of crude potash dissolved in water and poured over\r\nthe compost manure, or half-a-bushel of wood ashes, to a tree, will\r\nbe a good yearly allowance of potash; and half-a-peck of bones to a\r\ntree will supply the phosphorus. For the plum and the quince, salt is\r\nfound particularly useful, and ashes for the peach. But let it not be\r\nforgotten that the apple cannot live on lime alone, nor the peach\r\non potash, only that it is a special supply of these that they more\r\nparticularly require.[3]\r\n\r\n[3] Copperas (sulphate of iron) seems to act as a tonic upon trees.\r\nIf applied to feeble, pale-leaved shrubs and trees, it will often\r\nwonderfully invigorate them. It may be dissolved in water. A mild\r\nsolution of sulphate or muriate of ammonia has a similar effect, but\r\nmust be used with care.\r\n\r\nThe Herefordshire orchards suffer much more from moss, parasites, and\r\ninsects, and less pains are taken to guard against them or to destroy\r\nthem than is usual in New England. There is a fine moss that will\r\nnot easily be detected, that often collects upon the branches, and,\r\ndiverting the juices of the tree to its own nourishment, eventually,\r\nif not removed, destroys the bark; and limbs are seen frequently thus\r\ndenuded of their natural defence, and the wood consequently decaying.\r\nThis is doubtless a common cause of organic disease. The ordinary\r\npreventive and remedy for every thing of this sort is to wash the trunk\r\nand principal limbs of the tree every year with a weak lye—in which it\r\nis a good plan to put a little sulphur—all insects having a particular\r\nrepugnance to it.[4] If there is much dead, scaly bark, it should be\r\nfirst rubbed or scraped off.\r\n\r\n[4] 1 lb. of potash, _or_ 1 quart soft soap; and 4 oz. sulphur, to 1\r\ngallon of water.\r\n\r\nTrees should be allowed to branch low and naturally. The “trimming up”\r\nand unnatural exposure to the sun of the trunk of the pear-tree is\r\nknown to particularly predispose it to a most fatal malady. Where trees\r\nare properly managed while young, it will never be necessary to prune\r\ntheir limbs in our climate; and there can scarcely ever be a case where\r\nthe cutting off a limb larger than a man’s arm will not be likely to do\r\nmore harm than good. Wherever it is done, or wherever a large branch\r\nhas been blown off, the stump should be squared off neatly, and a salve\r\nof clay and cow-dung spread over it and secured upon it by a cap of\r\ncanvas or sheet-lead. Smaller stumps should be covered with paint, or\r\nwith a coating of shellac dissolved in alcohol.\r\n\r\nToo rapid and succulent growth, making imperfectly formed wood, through\r\nwhich the future processes of the growth of the tree or the fruit\r\nformation will be inefficiently performed, is occasioned either by too\r\nstimulating food in the soil, or by a forcing heat in the climate which\r\nexcites a growth unnatural to the original habit of the tree. There are\r\nalso probably other yet unexplained causes for it. The preventive must\r\nbe determined by the cause. The immediate remedy is shortening-in with\r\na knife one-quarter or one-half of the growth of each year. This is\r\nabsolutely necessary to the successful cultivation of the peach in many\r\nsituations in the United States, and, as I have shown, is sometimes\r\nused as a remedy for canker in the apple-tree in England.[5]\r\n\r\n[5] The principal enemy of the peach-tree is the borer, a worm which\r\nworks under the bark, near the surface of the ground. Its presence may\r\nbe known by the exudation of gum. Trees should be examined for it every\r\nspring and fall, and it may be easily pricked out and killed with a\r\nsharp-pointed knife.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _UNDER-DRAINING ORCHARDS._]\r\n\r\nToo retentive a subsoil, or a cold, sour, malarious bed for the roots\r\nof an orchard, is only to be remedied by under-draining. Mr. Thompson,\r\nof the London Horticultural Society, gives a striking instance of the\r\nprofit which may attend this operation.\r\n\r\nHaving detailed several experiments, he remarks that “want of drainage\r\ndeprives the roots of proper nourishment, subjects them to a chilling\r\ntemperature, and forces them to absorb a vitiated fluid.” He then\r\ndescribes an orchard planted, in 1828, upon a retentive marly clay. He\r\nsays, “the trees grew tolerably well for some time; but after seven\r\nyears they began to exhibit symptoms of ill thriving, and were every\r\nyear getting worse: I saw them in 1840, and instead of increasing\r\nin size they seemed to be decreasing.” The trees grew worse, and the\r\nfollowing year several died. It was then determined to drain the land:\r\n3000 feet of draining-tile were laid, 3 feet deep, in parallel lines,\r\n48 feet apart. In the spring of 1843, and in the autumn of the same\r\nyear, 3000 feet of drain pipes, 1¼ inch bore, were laid at 30 inches\r\ndeep, so that the drains were then only 24 feet apart; the ground at\r\nthe same time was dug over eight inches deep, and the trees pruned. The\r\nfollowing year the proprietor writes: “I never housed _any thing like_\r\n50 bushels before; now there are at least 75 bushels, while my summer\r\nfruit was at least double the usual quantity.” Upon this, Mr. Thompson\r\nremarks:— “The lopping-in of the trees and digging the ground, as above\r\ndescribed, were doubtless advantageous proceedings; but the draining\r\nof the ground was unquestionably the main cause of the extraordinary\r\nchange in the condition of the trees; for stunted specimens, that\r\nprevious to the draining were covered with moss, had made no shoots\r\nfor years, and were in such a state of decrepitude that there was\r\nnothing to cut away but dead wood; these had produced vigorous shoots\r\nwhen I saw them in 1847, and have continued to do so up to the present\r\ntime. Such vigour cannot be attributed to the cutting-in, for in\r\nthese cases it was not practised; nor to the digging of the ground,\r\nfor although this was done before draining was thought of, yet the\r\ntrees went backwards, the decay of their branches increased under all\r\ncircumstances till 1843, when recourse was had to draining, and since\r\nthen they have continued to do well, producing vigorous shoots—shoots\r\nupwards of three feet in length; and in the present season the fruit\r\nwas abundant, large, and highly coloured.”\r\n\r\nA case was mentioned before the Staten Island Farmer’s Club, in 1850,\r\nof an under-drain having been run near two greengage plum-trees, which\r\nhad previously been for many years entirely barren; the year after,\r\nwithout any other operation upon them, they bore _bushels_ of fruit.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A DEVONSHIRE CIDER FROLIC._]\r\n\r\nThe following satirical sketch of the management of the Devonshire\r\norchards, contains an amusing account of the ceremony of “shooting at\r\nthe apple-tree,” before alluded to.[6]\r\n\r\n[6] From the London Gardeners’ Chronicle.\r\n\r\n  “The trees are planted, to a large extent, apparently without\r\n  considering what sort of soil or situation is best, and without\r\n  making any previous preparation; a situation is chosen, a pit is dug\r\n  with a curious clumsy bit of iron, having a large socket-hole at one\r\n  end of it, in which is driven a large, strong pole, which answers for\r\n  a handle; it is worked with both hands over one knee; the depth that\r\n  the roots are buried does not seem to be of any moment, provided the\r\n  trees are firmly fixed, so as to prevent the wind from driving them\r\n  down. I have never observed any pruning performed, except such as is\r\n  done by bullocks, horses, donkeys, &c.; and as I have not observed\r\n  any “horse-ladders” here in use, of course the pruning is not very\r\n  effectively performed about the top part of the very lofty trees.\r\n  The only digging or stirring the surface of the ground among the\r\n  trees that I have observed is done by pigs, which are occasionally\r\n  allowed to rove in some orchards, at certain seasons of the year,\r\n  with the rings taken from their snouts. In a moist season these\r\n  intelligent animals occasionally turn up the ground in a tolerably\r\n  regular manner; and where this is the case the good effects of their\r\n  industry are obvious. However, it is only on rare occasions that\r\n  they are allowed to perform this surface operation. The animals that\r\n  do the pruning are the principal business-performing creatures, as,\r\n  in addition to that operation, they tread down the under crop of\r\n  grass, weeds, and other rubbish, take the fruit to the cider-mill,\r\n  and the cider to the consumer; besides, on rare occurrences, a little\r\n  manure is conveyed by them, and placed over the roots, close to the\r\n  trunks of the trees; it is sometimes, although rarely, placed at\r\n  the great distance of three or four feet from the trunk. Bipeds,\r\n  notwithstanding, perform some of the most interesting and essential\r\n  parts, such as planting, collecting the fruit, consuming it in part,\r\n  and assisting in making the cider; together with shooting at trees\r\n  annually on Old Twelfth-night. Let it rain, hail, blow, or snow, this\r\n  very essential and interesting ceremony is always commenced at 12\r\n  o’clock at night, a tremendous fire being kept up for several hours\r\n  afterwards. They repeat or sing the following interesting song, with\r\n  all the might which their lungs will permit. The juice of the fruit\r\n  is generally made use of for many hours, pretty freely, previously\r\n  to this interesting ceremony, so that a perfect ripeness of address\r\n  and expertness in gunnery is the result. Guns and firelocks long laid\r\n  by are on this remarkable occasion brought forward. The following\r\n  is what I have heard sung on these occasions, although much more is\r\n  added in some localities:—\r\n\r\n                “Here’s to thee, old apple-tree,\r\n      Whence thou mayest bud, and whence thou mayest blow;\r\n      And whence thou mayest bear apples enow;\r\n                Hats full, caps full!\r\n                Bushel, bushel-sacks full!\r\n                And my pockets full too!\r\n      If thee does not bear either apples or corn,\r\n      We’ll down with thy top, and up with thy horn.”\r\n\r\n                          (Here the natives shoot at the tree.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\nROOFS; SHINGLES; TILE; THATCH: THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES\r\nOF EACH.—THE USE OF THATCH IN AMERICA.—HEREFORD.—CHRISTIAN\r\nHOSPITALITY.—A MILK FARM.—THE HEREFORDS.—A DANGEROUS MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _TILE AND THATCHED ROOFS._]\r\n\r\nSomewhere in this region, we passed two small churches or chapels with\r\nroofs of wooden shingles; in both cases the pitch of the roof was very\r\nsteep, and the shingles old, warped, and mossy. These were the only\r\nshingle roofs I recollect to have seen in England; but I was told they\r\nwere not very uncommon upon old farm-buildings in Devonshire. The\r\nroofs hereabouts, generally, are of flat tile. In moulding these tile,\r\nwhich are of equal thickness at both ends, a hole is made in the upper\r\npart, by which they are pegged to slats, which run horizontally across\r\nthe rafters; (about London a protuberance is moulded upon the tile,\r\nby which it is hung.) This peg is covered, as the nails of a shingle\r\nare, by the lower part of the tile of the next tier above it. If no\r\nprecaution to prevent it is taken, there will sometimes be crevices in\r\na tile roof, through which snow will drive; in dwellings, a thin layer\r\nof straw is often laid under the tile, and sometimes they are laid in\r\nmortar. _Pan-tiles_ (common on old houses in New York) are also made\r\ntight with mortar. Roofs of this kind will last here about twice as\r\nlong as shingle roofs with us, without repairs, and are fireproof.\r\nUnless laid over straw, they give _less_ protection than shingles\r\nagainst heat and cold.\r\n\r\nThe roofing material changes completely often in one day’s walk;\r\nflat tiles giving place to slates, slates to pan-tiles, &c. In\r\nMonmouthshire, the roofs are generally made of a flat, shaly stone,\r\ncalled _tile-stone_, quarried not less than an inch thick. It is laid\r\nwith mortar, or straw or moss, like tile, and requires strong timber\r\nto support it. The better class of houses and modern farm-buildings,\r\nalmost every where, are slated; sometimes metal-roofed; very rarely\r\ncovered with _compositions_ or felt. Cottages and old farm-houses and\r\nstables, every where, except in the vicinity of slate quarries, are\r\nthatched. Straw thatch is commonly laid about eight inches thick. Its\r\npermanence depends on the pitch of the roof. Ordinarily it may last\r\ntwenty-five years; and when a new roof is required, the old thatch is\r\nnot removed, but a new layer of the same thickness is laid over the old\r\none. Frequently three and sometimes more layers of thatch may be seen\r\non an old building, the roof thus being often two feet thick. It is a\r\ncheaper roof than any other, and is much the best protection against\r\nboth cold and heat. The objection to it is that it harbours vermin, and\r\nis more liable to take fire from sparks than any other. The danger of\r\nthe latter is not as great, however, as would be supposed. I saw and\r\nheard of no houses on fire while I was in England, except in London.\r\nI frequently saw cottages in which coppice-wood was being burned, the\r\ntop of the chimney not a foot above the dry straw thatch, and the smoke\r\ndrifting right down upon it. The danger from fire would be somewhat\r\ngreater in America, where wood is more commonly used as fuel and rain\r\nis much less frequent. There are some situations in which it might\r\nbe safely employed, however, (if on dwellings, the chimney should be\r\nelevated more than usual,) and where it would form the cheapest and\r\nmost comfortable, and much the most picturesque and appropriate, roof.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _COTTAGE WALLS._]\r\n\r\nThe cost of the thatched roof of a double cottage, fifty by fifteen\r\nfeet, is estimated at one hundred and forty dollars, of which about\r\nforty dollars is for straw, forty dollars for thatcher’s work, and the\r\nremainder for the frame, lath, &c.\r\n\r\nThe walls of labourers’ cottages are of stone, or brick and timber, or\r\nof clay.\r\n\r\nIn making the latter, which are very common, the clay, having been\r\nwell forked over and cleaned of stones, is sprinkled with water, and\r\nhas short straw mixed with it, and is then trodden with horses and\r\nworked over until it becomes a plastic mass. The more it is trodden\r\nthe better. A foundation of stone is first made; one man forms the\r\nprepared clay into balls, or lumps as large as bricks, and passes these\r\nto another, who lays and packs them well and firmly together, dressing\r\noff smooth and straight with a trowel. After the height desired for the\r\nwall is attained, it is commonly plastered over inside and out with a\r\nthin coat of more carefully prepared clay, and whitewashed. This makes\r\nan excellent non-conducting wall, equal, in every respect, except in\r\npermanence, and almost in that, to stone or brick. Very respectable\r\nhouses, as villas and parsonages, are sometimes built in this way. It\r\ncosts about 30 cts. a square yard.\r\n\r\nI once or twice saw the walls of cottages made of or covered with\r\nthatch, and have no doubt, as long as vermin were kept out of them,\r\nthat they were, as was asserted, exceedingly comfortable. These were\r\ngentlemen’s country boxes, not labourers’ cottages!\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _HETERODOXY._]\r\n\r\nOn reaching Hereford, a city of 10,000 inhabitants, we were met by\r\na gentleman to whom word had been sent by some of the “Brethren” at\r\nLudlow, who begged us all to come to his house, and, upon reaching it,\r\nwe found rooms prepared for us, and his family expecting us. This\r\nhospitality was entirely unexpected: the gentleman was a stranger\r\nto us; we had not even ever heard his name before; nevertheless, he\r\ncontrived to make us feel perfectly at home, and free to dispose of our\r\ntime to suit ourselves.\r\n\r\nAfter tea he walked with us about the town, and took us a little into\r\nthe country, to see a small milk-dairy and orchard-farm. The cows were\r\nof the Hereford breed, but not full-blooded, nor have we seen many\r\nthat were. Most of the cattle in this vicinity have more or less of\r\nthe marks of the breed, and their quality is about in proportion to\r\ntheir purity. The poorest cattle I have seen in England were within two\r\nmiles of Hereford, but there was no mark of Hereford blood in them, and\r\nthey had probably been bought out of the county, and brought there to\r\nfatten. The best milkers on this farm were not the best-bred cows. The\r\naverage value of the herd was not far from $35 a-head. They were kept\r\nin a long stable; mangers and floor of wood, a slope of half an inch\r\nin a foot to the latter, with a gutter in the rear. They were entirely\r\nhouse-fed, on green clover. They were milked by women, and the milk all\r\nsold in the town.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening, our host called with us on the Rev. Mr. ——,\r\na right warm, manly, Christian gentleman, who, though in domestic\r\naffliction, on learning that we were Americans, received us most\r\ncordially. We found him singularly familiar with American matters, both\r\npolitical and theological; a portrait of Dr. Bushnell, of Hartford,\r\nalong with that of Dr. Arnold, and other worthies, was over his mantel,\r\nthe last “New-Englander” on his table, and a fragrance peculiarly\r\nadapted to make an American feel at home, soon pervaded the atmosphere\r\nof his study. We had a most agreeable and valuable conversation, and\r\nit was long before we could return to the hospitable quarters which\r\nhad been provided for us for the night. Mr. —— is an Independent, or,\r\nas he prefers to be called, a Congregationalist; accounted somewhat\r\nheterodox, and treated with a cold shoulder by some of the scribes\r\nand doctors, we were afterwards informed; but of this we discovered\r\nnothing, and imagine him to be merely a peculiarly candid, humane,\r\nand genial man, only less than usually disguised or constrained in\r\nexpression, by habits, precedents, and dogmatic forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n       WARM BREAKFAST AND WARM HEARTS.—TRUE SELF-DENIAL—PRIMITIVE\r\n                      CHRISTIANITY.—A LIVING FAITH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                  HEREFORD, _June 12th_.\r\n\r\nWhen we came into the parlour, at half-past seven, we found a\r\nbreakfast-party met to greet us. Our host had been to an early\r\ndaylight prayer-meeting, and some business had detained him; but his\r\nfriends introduced each other to us, and we went to breakfast without\r\nwaiting for him. It was a good, warm, respectable breakfast—fit for\r\na Christian. English breakfasts in general are quite absurd; not\r\nbreakfasts at all, but just aggravations of fasts, and likely to put a\r\nman in any thing but a Christian humour for his day’s work. As for the\r\nbetter part of the meal, see C.’s letter, (from which I here extract):\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PRIMITIVE CHRISTIAN SPIRIT._]\r\n\r\n“I shall not soon forget those earnest, simple-hearted men. In many\r\ncircles one would be repelled by such constant use of religious\r\nphrases, but in them it did not seem like _cant_ at all—rather the\r\nusual expression with them of true feeling. It was a company too well\r\nworth considering. Opposite me sat a middle-aged gentleman, who had\r\nbeen a major-general in the East India service, and who belonged to\r\none of the first families in the kingdom. Yet he had given up his\r\ncommission and his position in society for the sake of doing good as\r\nan humble Christian. His half-pay, too, he had refused, believing it\r\ninconsistent for a religious man to receive money for services of such\r\na nature. He had been a scholar also, and had written a dictionary of\r\nthe Mahratta tongue. Besides him, there was a lieutenant in the navy,\r\nwho had thrown up his commission from similar religious scruples, and\r\na prominent surgeon of the city, devoted, like the rest, to Christian\r\nefforts almost entirely. They had been to a prayer-meeting, and the\r\nconversation, with the Bible open on the table, commenced at once on\r\na passage in John. It was beautiful, the simple, natural way they all\r\nconversed of religious topics—no straining for sanctity, but easily and\r\nearnestly, as men usually would speak of weighty political matters.\r\n\r\n“But, free as is the plan of these brethren, I am sorry to say that in\r\nreal liberality they do not go beyond most others. The conversation\r\nduring breakfast turned on the Roman Catholics. Most of them went so\r\nfar as to doubt whether a Papist ever could be a Christian. The major\r\ndisagreed with them, and it was noble, the enthusiasm with which\r\nhe spoke of the pure and earnest Pascal. Generally, however, their\r\nfeeling toward men of different doctrinal opinions was much like that\r\nof any sectarians. The Independent clergyman at Hereford says that\r\nthe most he has known are men of the Church of England, and that they\r\nhave just grasped a few great ideas, which the Independents have been\r\npreaching since the time of Cromwell. And certainly, as compared with\r\n‘the Church,’ their religious character is most simple and free. It\r\nwas curious to notice, as an illustration of English manners, that all\r\nthese men, the most spiritual of the whole community, took their beer\r\nor wine as regularly as we would our tea.”\r\n\r\nIn addition to the evidence of the sincere character of the “Brethren”\r\ninstanced above, I may mention that another of our company had been\r\nan apothecary, and given up his business from a conviction that\r\nHomeopathy was a better way than the common drugging, and that we\r\nafterwards met one, a near relative of one of the most distinguished\r\nnoblemen and statesmen of Great Britain, who had retired from a highly\r\nhonourable and lucrative official position, from a desire to live more\r\nin accordance with his religious aspirations than his duties in it\r\npermitted him to. I shall omit to narrate what more we saw of them, as\r\nwe proceeded further on our journey; but must say, to conclude, that\r\nif, in letting no man judge them in meat or in drink, or in respect of\r\na holy day—if, in teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and\r\nhymns and spiritual songs—if, in bowels of mercy, kindness, humbleness\r\nof mind, meekness, self-sacrifice, and zealous readiness to every good\r\nwork—if, especially, in real genuine hospitality to strangers, there be\r\nany thing of “primitive Christianity,” our entertainers seemed to us\r\nto have had very great success in their purpose to return to it. They\r\ncertainly were not without their share of bigotry and self-confidence\r\nin such matters of creed as they happened to hold in common; but this\r\ndid not seem to have the effect upon them of destroying geniality and\r\ngood fellowship, nor of cramping the spirit of practical, material, and\r\nunromantic benevolence. They were quite different, too, in their way of\r\ntalking upon those subjects on which they conceived their minds to be\r\n“at rest,” from the theological students at ——, whom —— describes as\r\nstudying as if they had bought tickets for the night-train to heaven,\r\nand, having requested the conductor to call them when they got there,\r\nwere trying to get into the most comfortable position to sleep it\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COUNTY JAIL.—ENGLISH PRISON DISCIPLINE.—THE PERFECTION OF THE\r\nPRESENT.—EDUCATION AND TAXATION.—WHAT NEXT?—CAPTAIN MACHONOCHIE.—THE\r\nMARK SYSTEM.—THE CHRISTIAN IDEA OF PUNISHMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _HEREFORD JAIL._]\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast, we visited the county prison. It is on the plan of\r\nthe celebrated Pentonville model prison, near London, which is an\r\nimprovement on what is called the Philadelphia plan. Any of my readers\r\nwho are much interested in the great and most puzzling problem of\r\nprison discipline will be familiar with the elements of the last\r\nexperiment of the British Government upon the sad subject.\r\n\r\nThis specimen of it at Hereford was all that could be asked for in its\r\nway. Evidently, no skill in planning and no expense in execution had\r\nbeen wanting to make it as perfect as such a thing could be.\r\n\r\nWe were first conducted through several long, light, and airy\r\ncorridors, upon which opened the well-ventilated sleeping-cells of the\r\nprisoners—each cell appearing the _perfection of a cell_, as if made\r\nto the order of some noble amateur rascal, in the most complete and\r\nfinished style which would be appropriate to an apartment with that\r\ndesignation: the walls of plain hewn stone, but white as bishop’s lawn;\r\nthe floor damp-proof, of asphalte; the bedstead of iron, the bed of\r\nsufficiently appropriate coarseness, snugly and neatly _made up_ as if\r\nby the joint labour of a tasteful upholsterer and a skilful laundress;\r\nwarmed on the hot-water plan; furnished with a wash-bowl, and pure\r\nwater brought by pipes; lighted by a beam of filtrated sunshine by day,\r\nand a jet of gas-flame by night; provided also with a bell or signal,\r\nby which the interesting inmate may at any time, in case of bodily\r\nailment, summon a regular bred physician to his relief, or a veritable\r\nand legitimate “descendant of the apostles,” in case he should be taken\r\nsuddenly aback with repentance during the night: at every bed-head\r\ntoo—regularly as the crucifix in the dormitories of monks, or the\r\nsquat, yellow _Josh_ in the habitation of the Chinese—a bible. “The\r\nBible! ah! how must his heart melt, and his dark mind be enlightened,\r\nas in his retirement from the wild temptations of the wicked world the\r\nprisoner is left to be absorbed in its glorious tidings. What a feast,\r\nwhat a treasure, what a ——” nay, the shining leather and sticking\r\nleaves tell us that even the Bible Societies may throw pearls before\r\nswine.\r\n\r\n“Aye,” says the turnkey:—“_He can’t read_—a young chap—in for two\r\nmonths; petty larceny.”\r\n\r\nWe open and read.—“He that _knew not_, and did commit things worthy of\r\nstripes, shall be beaten with few stripes. For unto whomsoever much is\r\ngiven, of him shall much be required; and to whom men have committed\r\nmuch, of him they will ask the more.”\r\n\r\nIt was given him to have a mind uneducated except in ignorance and\r\ncriminal contrivance, and it was required of him, he might tell us, to\r\neither starve or steal; and then there is given him good, comfortable,\r\nclean, wholesome air, water, food, lodging, and exercise, (not work.)\r\nMoreover, there is added this _sealed_ book. Must he not think it\r\nmockery?\r\n\r\nBut we are not allowed to philosophize, or moralize, or criticise.\r\nWe are expected only to admire, and are passed along to the culinary\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A MODEL PRISON._]\r\n\r\n_Perfection_ again—of a kitchen with an admirable, stout, dignified\r\n_chef-de-cuisine_, graduate of Paris doubtless, presiding. The\r\ndiet-table he explains to us, is scientifically ordered; the beef and\r\nbread and vegetable are of the best, and we are shown how the quantity\r\nfor each man in each particular is accurately weighed out. The patients\r\nare also weighed periodically, and the allowance of food and of\r\nexercise is studiously adjusted to the condition of each.\r\n\r\nNext we are taken to the day cells, which are in several separate\r\ncourts. Within each is an ingeniously-contrived crank attached to a\r\ncommon shaft revolving through all. This crank is _the exerciser_.\r\nThe prisoner stands at a certain distance before it, takes hold of it\r\nwith both hands, and, as it turns, a certain motion is given to his\r\nwhole body—the most healthful sort of motion: expanding the chest, and\r\nmoving every joint of his limbs. He remains in this cell ten hours\r\neach day, Sundays excepted; and the usual allowance of exercise is\r\nhalf an hour, with ten minutes’ rest after it, continued alternately\r\nduring that time. There is a library in the prison, from which primers,\r\npicture-books, and tracts, are served out for the exercise of his mind\r\nduring the ten minutes’ bodily rests.\r\n\r\nFor Sundays, there is provided another sort of cells, which are so\r\narranged that each prisoner can look at the same central point, but\r\ncannot see any other prisoner. At the central point is placed a humble\r\nvessel, (doubtless as _perfect_ as can be made by ordinances, and\r\nduly clad in regulation vesture,) from which a stated dose of “gospel\r\nprivileges” is scientifically discharged and systematically imbibed\r\nby every patient—prisoner I mean. There are two such rations given\r\non Sunday, with a dinner between, and opportunity for reflection in\r\nprivate, before and after.\r\n\r\nIt is a first principle of the plan that labour should end where it\r\nbegins. The exercising shaft is sometimes applied to a pump-brake to\r\nfill the reservoir over the prison with water, but never in any other\r\nway saves labour. Pains are taken in every way, not with absolute\r\nsuccess it is admitted, to secure utter silence, and to prevent all\r\ncommunication between the prisoners. Criminals are rarely sent here for\r\nmore than twelve months; and it is said, that with all the science and\r\ncare that can be devoted to them, their health, both bodily and mental,\r\nis endangered, if their confinement is protracted longer.\r\n\r\nIt may be, as its admirers have no shadow of doubt, the happiest\r\nidea of a prison most happily realized that the world yet knows;\r\nyet it is one of the most painful things to examine that I ever\r\nsaw. It is hardly possible to speak well of it but in irony, or to\r\ndescribe it without sarcasm, so absurd seems all this scientific care\r\nfor the well-being—physical, mental, and moral—of these miserable\r\ntransgressors, contrasted with the studied neglect, justified and\r\nmade praiseworthy by strictly economical and religious reasoning, of\r\nthe unoffending poor. While no talent, painstaking, and complicated\r\nmachinery, is too expensive and cumbrous to be devoted to the keeping\r\nof the criminal, of the unfortunate, society, through the state, still\r\nsays—_Am I my brother’s keeper?_\r\n\r\nHold the hand! Dash not the book behind the grate, my conservative\r\nfriend; I would hint at nothing more dangerous than _education_—a\r\nword one may yet speak in America without being finally condemned\r\nas an infidel and a socialist, and a man given to _isms_. Would you\r\nstill call me to order, remind me that I am writing on the subject of\r\nprisons—English prisons—and that I may take up the subject of schools\r\nin another chapter. Yet there may be lessons learned from prisons, and\r\nEnglish prisons teach lessons that all who do not care for the subject\r\nof education would do well to heed.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _EDUCATION AND CRIME._]\r\n\r\nIn the prisons of England, in 1841, it was found that out of every\r\nhundred criminals then supported by the state—\r\n\r\n  33 had never learned to read or write;\r\n  56 were able to read and write imperfectly;\r\n   7 were able to read and write well; and only\r\n   1 _in two hundred and twenty-two_ had been favoured, with\r\n       “instruction superior to reading and writing.”[7]\r\n\r\n[7] Parliamentary Document, 1842.\r\n\r\nOnly 28 in every hundred were over 30 years of age! So soon in crime\r\ncome forward and pass away the children of ignorance.\r\n\r\nThe chaplain of the Brecon jail reports, that though the majority of\r\nthe prisoners to whom he ministers are able to read imperfectly, yet\r\ntheir education has been so defective that they have no notion of the\r\nbearing and connection of one part of a sentence with another. Nine out\r\nof ten of them were ignorant of the merest rudiments of Christianity.\r\nThe chaplain of the Bedford jail states that the great majority of\r\nprisoners there confined are “ignorant, stupid, and unconcerned.”\r\nAnother jail chaplain observes of those “children, or men still\r\nchildish,” under his care, who _had_ been instructed in reading and\r\nwriting, “they had not learned to think about or understand any thing\r\nthat they had been taught; the ears had heard, the tongue had learned\r\nutterance, but the mind had received no idea, no impression.” (The\r\nreader may be reminded of what I said of sailors’ reading.[8]) From the\r\nBucks county jail it is reported that about half the prisoners have\r\nnever been taught to read and write, and about one quarter are ignorant\r\nof the alphabet; and that “_ignorance is uniformly accompanied with the\r\ngreatest depravity_.”[9]\r\n\r\n[8] Walks and Talks, i. 33.\r\n\r\n[9] Jail Returns to the House of Commons, 1848.\r\n\r\nHad we not better give up our “godless schools,” and establish some\r\ngodly prisons for the next generation? Surely we may learn something\r\nfrom the statesmanship that is wedded to a church.\r\n\r\nI heard a crusty old bachelor say the other day, growling at the Free\r\nSchool Laws: “But I have no children, and I don’t want to pay for the\r\nschooling of my neighbour’s brats; if they were begging for bread,\r\nit would be another thing.” The land of free trade has something to\r\ntell us about this too. “Nine out of twelve of the inmates of the\r\n_Poor-houses_ of Norfolk and Suffolk cannot write their names.”[10]\r\n\r\n[10] Von Raumer.\r\n\r\nNever forget, citizens of the United States, that the children within a\r\nrepublic are, and must be, “THE CHILDREN OF THE REPUBLIC.” Do your duty\r\nto them, or they will not do their duty to you.\r\n\r\nTo return to the Hereford jail: I intimated that every thing said in\r\nadmiration of it seemed necessarily ironical and bitter; but I do\r\nrecall one pleasant, and, I doubt not, true word, for it—“_it is a\r\npalace compared with the old one_.”\r\n\r\nGood!—surely that is good: no one will ask us to go back to packing\r\ncriminals, and all under surveillance of the law, promiscuously into\r\ngreat stone pens, giving them rotten straw to rest upon, and supplying\r\nonly the cheapest grub that will offer to keep body and soul together.\r\nFew will be inclined to think that the world’s prisons—hell triumphant\r\nin Austria and Naples excepted—are not better now than in the day\r\nof Howard. Progress there has been, even here, true and substantial\r\nprogress, thank God! Progress there must be, for the kingdom of God\r\nmoves steadily on. This palace-prison is but a mile-stone on the road.\r\n\r\nWhat next? There are some pamphlets before me in which an answer to\r\nthis question is attempted to be given.[11] The matter is one of so\r\nmuch difficulty and so great importance, so nearly connected with the\r\nprogress of Christianity and civilized law, and the plan of a new\r\nprison is so often to be discussed and established among our thirty\r\nstates and thousand counties, that I must beg my readers to carefully\r\nexamine the new system of punishment that they propose, and I urge it\r\nthe more, because, so far as I know, it has, up to this time, entirely\r\nescaped the attention of the American press.\r\n\r\n[11] “The Principles of Punishment,” by Captain Machonochie, R. N.,\r\nK. H: J. Ollivier, Pall Mall, London. “Crime and Punishment,” by\r\nCaptain Machonochie: J. Hatchard & Son, London. An “Essay on Criminal\r\nJurisprudence,” by Marmaduke B. Sampson: Highley & Son, London. These\r\nworks may all be obtained through the agency of the publisher of this\r\nbook, and will be found to contain (especially the last) some most\r\nvaluable hints and suggestions applicable to other matters besides\r\nprison discipline. Their cost is trifling.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PRINCIPLES OF PUNISHMENT._]\r\n\r\nBut first let us distinctly recall to mind what is most unsatisfactory\r\nand clearly defective in our present prisons and system of criminal\r\npunishment.\r\n\r\nThere are two general principles with regard to the punishment of crime\r\nthat have been theoretically received and approved of in the minds of\r\nall enlightened and Christian people, and yet to which there is much in\r\nour present system that is practically false and repugnant. We _say_\r\n“necessarily so,” and that this necessity is one of the awful results\r\nof crime or sin. God knows if we are right. If not, we are terribly\r\nwrong.\r\n\r\nThe principles or rules with regard to punishment, to which I refer,\r\nare these: that it should not be _vindictive_ or revengeful, that it is\r\nnot the business of human jurisprudence to satisfy the abstract claims\r\nof justice, “_Vengeance is mine_, saith the Lord;” that, on the other\r\nhand, it should be our purpose, in the treatment of criminals, so far\r\nas may be consistent with the good of society, to do them good, to\r\nmake them better, stronger, and happier. This also is a corollary of\r\nthe second principle to which I refer, namely, that the great end of\r\ncriminal law is to prevent, discourage, and lessen crime.\r\n\r\nI say that practically, among the mass of our community, the punishment\r\nof criminals is felt to be, and is engaged in as if it were, the\r\nsatisfaction of a vindictive feeling against an enemy of society, a\r\nsatisfaction that the law makes him _pay_ (though “_I will repay, saith\r\nthe Lord!_”) in the inconvenience and suffering of his confinement and\r\n_hard labour_, for the injury he has done society or some member of\r\nsociety. That, _practically_, the criminal has the counterpart of this\r\nfeeling, considering that society looks upon him as its enemy, and,\r\nwhen it catches him, vindictively makes him suffer for his crime, as\r\nif it were a match between him and the law, in which he was the loser;\r\nand that the effect of looking upon it in this way is to aggravate\r\nand intensify the evil which we theoretically propose to cure by his\r\nimprisonment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _MORAL INFLUENCES ON THE PRISONER._]\r\n\r\nIt is true, that in accordance with the purpose of improving the\r\ncharacter of criminals during (I cannot say, _by_) their imprisonment,\r\nwe employ chaplains to preach and counsel them, and give them books,\r\nthat it is supposed, in the absence of any other employment of the\r\nmind, may engage their attention. And these are the only means employed\r\nat present for the purpose of training them to be active, efficient,\r\nindustrious, and well-disposed members of society, upon their release!\r\nI might bring forward endless statistics in proof, but few will be\r\ninclined to deny that for this purpose these means constantly prove\r\nthemselves entirely inadequate; that, in this respect, our system is a\r\n_constant and complete failure_. Why? Because of the “foolishness of\r\npreaching?” Because virtue is taught only theoretically; and a field\r\nof practice, of resistance of the temptation to the peculiar sins\r\nwhich we denominate crime, is required to give such lessons practical\r\nvalue? Because under a system in which a man is provided with good\r\nand sufficient food, clothing, lodging, fuel, and other necessities of\r\nhealth and life, to a degree of perfection that he never knew before,\r\nwithout the exercise of any personal care, forethought, skill, or\r\nlabour, much of the real manly virtue of active life becomes a dead\r\nletter, and cannot be acquired? Because the religion that is preached\r\ndoes not make necessary the practice of prudence, energy, economy,\r\nindustry, and honest ingenuity? Because, under such circumstances,\r\ninstead of the reception of an elevating, reforming, purifying\r\nprinciple of life, a religion of weak, mystic frames of feeling, and\r\nsentimental professions, is more likely to be encouraged, and is hardly\r\ndistinguishable or avoidable to be confused with vital piety? Or is it\r\nbecause nearly _all the other influences_ about the imprisoned criminal\r\nare enervating, or opposed to reform and virtue? Horrible thought!\r\nBut let us consider how he is situated; what are the influences, what\r\nthe natural motives, that are likely to be operating upon him in the\r\ncircumstances in which we place him.\r\n\r\nThe criminal is sentenced, we will suppose, for ten years, and finds\r\nhimself locked into a narrow cell, where it is only at occasional and\r\ncomparatively distant intervals that he can be communicated with, even\r\nby his _keeper_, chaplain, or physician, the only human beings who\r\nhave access to him. It may be for a certain time each day he is set\r\nto labour; _hard labour_ being given him, not as a privilege, not as\r\na relief, not as a means of bettering his condition, or in any way\r\nas to be loved and valued; but as an addition to the _punishment_ of\r\nsolitary confinement. It may be practically a relief; but when we admit\r\nit to be so, under the circumstances in which it is engaged in, we\r\nmust have some notion of the dreary loneliness and tedious prospect\r\nwhich he has in his cell, though in it comforts, which in the ordinary\r\ngovernment of Providence he would have been taught to look upon as\r\nthe natural rewards of activity, prudence, and labour, are crowded\r\naround him. He is left to his own thoughts; his recollections are\r\nvicious; are his anticipations likely to be virtuous? With ten years\r\nto be spent under these circumstances, what will his mind be most\r\nlikely to be directed to? Will it not be to means of beguiling his time\r\nin sleep or self-forgetfulness, or to evade his compulsory labour?\r\nCould any way be better contrived to fix a man in a disposition to\r\nidleness and vagrancy? His life stagnates, his impulses putrify, his\r\nonly activity is directed in the search for opportunities of personal\r\ngratification—which are obtained, we are told, even in ways most\r\nhorrible—and for this purpose his powers of _deception_ are sharpened,\r\nor, when unable to offend in act, he seeks in fancy a gratification by\r\ngloating over impure images.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _WHAT SHALL WE WAR AGAINST?_]\r\n\r\nAnd is this lame, inconsistent, miserable plan, all its details so\r\nworking at cross purposes, _the end_ of all the philanthropic labours,\r\nprivate and associated, that have been given to the subject during the\r\nlast fifty years? The _result_, good friends, not the _end_. Then, in\r\nGod’s name, WHAT NEXT?\r\n\r\nAn answer from Captain Machonochie will be found in the Appendix\r\nC, and I beg for it, with all earnestness, the thoughtful perusal\r\nof my countrymen. It is based on plain, distinct, uncontradictory\r\nprinciples, which are applicable to the punishment of all criminals,\r\nand to the construction of all criminal laws. It is the plan of no\r\ncloset philosopher, but of a cool-headed, warm-hearted sailor, who was\r\nchosen by his government, for his manifest natural qualifications for\r\nundertaking the superintendence of criminals, to take charge of one of\r\nits most responsible penal establishments. It is a plan that has been\r\nwell considered, and is ably defended to the minutest details, as the\r\nreader, who is willing to study it further, will find, on referring to\r\nthe pamphlets I have mentioned in the note on a previous page.[12]\r\n\r\n[12] For a refutation of objections, see, particularly, the Report\r\nof the Committee on Criminal Law of the “_Society for Promoting the\r\nAmendment of the Law_.”\r\n\r\nIt seems to me like a great invention, so simple, so natural, so\r\nin every way commending itself immediately to my mind, that I am\r\namazed that the world is but just arriving at it, and I thank God\r\nthat I have to live and do my work in the day it brightens. For it\r\nseems to me more than an invention—an inspiration. At least I find\r\nin it the principles of Jesus Christ, now at length consistently and\r\nsatisfactorily applied to the treatment of criminals. The most prudent\r\nregard for the interests of society at large will oblige us no longer\r\nto set our teeth, and clench our hands, and steel our hearts to pity,\r\nin the jury-box, but will combine with the truest kindness, hope, and\r\nprayer in faith, for the individual good of the criminal. Under our\r\npresent criminal laws, and with our present systems of punishment, the\r\nfirst task of the prosecuting attorney is, too often, to turn us from\r\nthe estate of warm-hearted Christian love, into cold, calculating,\r\nvengeful savages. But now, that which has heretofore been the most\r\ntrying, confounding, and insnaring responsibility upon the Christian\r\ncitizen, may become a reasonable, happy, improving duty and privilege.\r\nPunishment shall be awarded with loving-kindness. Punishment shall be\r\nthe handmaid of Love.\r\n\r\nAnd now, is it more than a question of how long we halt in this\r\nwretched, self-destructive darkness? Is there not light enough for the\r\nnext step? Speak out, good heart of the People! _Shall we henceforth do\r\nbattle with Criminals or with Crime?_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nA HIT.—THE DEBTORS’ PRISON.—UTTER CLEANLINESS.—“CITY” AND\r\n“TOWN.”—“DOWN” AND “UP.”—HEREFORD CATHEDRAL.—CHURCH AND STATE.—THE\r\nPUBLIC PROMENADE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI must not forget two incidents of our visit to the jail. Punishment is\r\ninflicted by withholding food; also, I imagine, for slight offences,\r\nin other ways. An officer with us noticed some untidiness of dress\r\nupon one of the prisoners, and, pointing to it, said,—“You are an\r\nEnglishman: _I don’t want to treat you as an Irishman_.” As we entered\r\na certain apartment, our conductor said, “This is the debtors’ prison.”\r\n\r\nOne of us remarked, “We have generally abolished imprisonment for debt\r\nin the United States.”\r\n\r\nThe officer, quietly, “It’s a pity that you have.”\r\n\r\nThe quarters of the debtors were not cells, but decent rooms, and\r\nthere was a large hall common to them. Every thing here, though, as\r\nevery where else, was dreadfully clean, dreary, and mathematical,\r\nlike a gone-mad housekeeper’s idea of heaven. I should expect that\r\nthe prisoners would long, more than any thing else, to have one good\r\nroll in the gutter, and an unmeasured mouthful of some perfectly\r\nindigestible luxury. It was a relief, after being but an hour within\r\nthe walls, to step out once more into the good old mud and clouds and\r\nsmells of Nature again.\r\n\r\nAmong the debtors, one was pointed out to us as a well-educated lawyer,\r\nformerly having a large and respectable practice, and enjoying a\r\nconsiderable fortune. He had been confined for several years, but, it\r\nwas thought, would soon be released. The placards of an association for\r\ntaking the part of imprisoned debtors were posted in the hall.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _HEREFORD CATHEDRAL._]\r\n\r\nThe title _city_ is applied, in England, only to a town which is\r\nthe residence of a bishop, and is equivalent to “a cathedral town.”\r\nHereford is a city; Chester is a city; but Liverpool, with ten times\r\nthe population of both of them, is not a city. The term _town_, again,\r\nin England, is never applied to the subdivisions of a county, (a\r\ntownship,) but is used to designate a place that is closely built,\r\nand with a considerable population—what we should give the title of\r\n_city_ to. Thus London, the largest town, is every where called “the\r\ntown.” “The city” designates a small part of London, near the Cathedral\r\nof St. Paul. (All over Great Britain they speak of going “_down_ to\r\nLondon,” never “up.” This use of “down” and “up,” meaninglessly, in a\r\nsentence, I had supposed was a “down-east” idiom; but it is common in\r\nold England.)\r\n\r\nThe cathedral at Hereford, built in the time of William the Conqueror,\r\nis in a more ornamental style of Gothic than any ancient religious\r\nedifice we had seen. I did not greatly admire it. Considerable\r\nadditions or repairs have been lately made. On one of the new gables I\r\nwas surprised to see some fifty of those grotesque heads, freshly cut.\r\nThey were not very ugly, or very droll—indeed, had no marked character,\r\nor any thing that showed a genius, even for the comical, in their\r\ndesigner or executor. They were not necessary to the harmony of the\r\nmodern work with the old; were, I think, discordant, and what they were\r\nput there for I don’t know. Extensive alterations had lately been made\r\nin the choir, and it was the most convenient hall for public exercises\r\nthat I recollect to have seen in any English cathedral. The ceiling was\r\npainted (in encaustic) in the bright-coloured _bizarre_ style that I\r\nspoke of at the castle near Shrewsbury. As I entered, it seemed to me\r\nto be in shockingly bad taste for a place of meditation and worship.\r\nWe attended the daily morning service, and heard some fine gentle\r\nmusic—the organ sweetly played, and the singers all boys.\r\n\r\nI was glad to notice that our dissenting friends seemed to have a\r\npride and sense of possession in the cathedral, as if they were not\r\nin the habit of thinking of it as _belonging_ exclusively to those\r\nwho occupied it, but as if it was _intrusted_ to them, and as well to\r\nthem as to any other division, as representative of the whole Catholic\r\nChurch of all English Christians. This way of looking upon “the Church”\r\nusurpations is quite commonly observable among the dissenters. It\r\nis not so honourable to them when applied to other things than mere\r\nfurniture, as, for instance, the giving the exclusive teaching of\r\nreligious doctrine to the children, or paupers, or soldiers, in whom\r\nthey have a common interest, to the State Church, from a supposed\r\nnecessity of giving it to some _one_ in preference to all others; and\r\nif not to their particular church, then of best right to the church\r\nof the strongest. The idea that some State Church, separated from\r\nothers by its doctrinal basis, is expedient, and almost necessary, to a\r\nChristian government, is quite common among dissenters. In my judgment,\r\nit cannot be expedient, because it is very evidently unjust. What is in\r\nthe least degree unjust can never be expedient for a state, the very\r\npurpose of which should be to elevate and secure justice among the\r\npeople who live under its laws.\r\n\r\nNor can I conceive of any thing so likely to strangle a church as to\r\nbe hung with exclusive privileges from the State. For what are these?\r\nBribes for the profession of doctrines and the acceptance of rules of\r\ndebatable expediency; giving encouragement, so far as they have any\r\ninfluence, (that they would not have if the Church were independent of\r\nthe power of the State,) to insincerity and the unearnest formation of\r\nopinions—to unreality, which is deadness in a church.\r\n\r\nThat the constant practice of perjury and the most miserably jesuitical\r\nnotions of truth and falsehood, and that weakness and imbecility of\r\nboth Church and State, is the direct and inevitable result at the\r\npresent day of such a connection as is attempted to be sustained\r\nbetween them in England, it is as obvious and certain to me as any\r\nthing can be, that such great and good men as the divines and statesmen\r\nof England have different opinions with regard to.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE REPUBLIC IN ENGLAND._]\r\n\r\nThere is a large green, close planted with trees, about the cathedral,\r\nand facing upon it are the official residences of the regiment of\r\nclergy, high priests and low, that under some form or other are\r\nprovided with _livings_ in connection with it. In front of one of these\r\nbarracks was planted a bomb-mortar—with what signification?\r\n\r\nThere is another public promenade in Hereford, upon the site of an old\r\ncastle which was demolished by Cromwell.\r\n\r\nThe ramparts are grassed over, and there are fine trees, ponds,\r\ngravel-walks, an obelisk in honour of Nelson, some graceful\r\nirregularities of surface, and a broad, purling stream of clear water\r\nflowing by it all. Here, before noon, we found a considerable company,\r\nof varied character: ladies walking briskly and talking animatedly;\r\ninvalids, wrapped up and supported, loitering in the sun; cripples,\r\nmoving about in wheelchairs; students or novel-readers in the deepest\r\nshades; and every where, many nursery-maids with children. Not a town\r\nhave we seen in England but has had a better garden-republic than any\r\ntown I know of in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\nA STAGE-COACH RIDE.—CONVERSATION WITH THE COACHMAN.—A\r\nFREE-TRADER.—AMERICAN AND ENGLISH WOMEN.—FAIR PLAY.—WOMAN’S\r\nRIGHTS.—SOCIAL DIFFERENCES.—FRENCHMEN.—NATIONAL VANITIES.—\r\nDEMOCRACY.—FREE TRADE.—RETALIATION.—ARISTOCRACY.—NATURAL\r\nLAWS.—THE LAW OF LOVE.—FRATERNITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FOUR IN HAND._]\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon, C. went to visit some antiquities of the\r\nneighbourhood, and my brother and I were invited by our host to visit a\r\nlarge farm on the border of Monmouthshire. We were to go the first ten\r\nmiles by stage-coach. On the coach-top there were two women, who sat\r\nwith some children and the guard in the rear, upon seats over what is\r\nthe _boot_ of our coaches. Forward, there was a small, sickly-looking\r\nman, his face covered with a close-cropped, grayish beard, his\r\nright arm hanging, as it seemed, lifeless, and an old-fashioned\r\ntravelling-cap upon his head. He seemed to be a foreigner, and, without\r\nspeaking, but with courteous manner, made room for my friends at\r\nhis side. I was seated on the box, between the coachman and another\r\npassenger. The former was a staid, sober man, neatly, but no way\r\npeculiarly, dressed; talking, as if well posted up, but without any\r\nself-conceit, on matters that he had a fancy for—to wit: horses,\r\nracing, boxing, the crops on the roadside, the weather, female beauty,\r\nand woman’s rights, but perfectly mum and uncomprehending beyond these.\r\nHe drove in the most accomplished and gentlemanlike style—never with\r\na hasty movement, or a show of exertion, or even attention—yet never\r\nlosing his _feel_ of every horse’s mouth, and having each in such\r\nperfect command, and guiding and governing them all so easily and\r\ngracefully, that it seemed as if the reins were a part of him and he\r\nmoved them by instinct; just as a good helmsman will bring up his boat\r\nto “meet” a surging sea, without knowing it, and even when half asleep.\r\nHe never lifted a whip from the socket, except to _punish_ a horse\r\nfor indulging in some trick, or for neglect to obey the signal of his\r\nvoice, which was hardly ever more than a short chirrup—no whistling,\r\nshouting, and calling by name. The speed, with a heavy load, was\r\nexcellent, averaging nearly eleven miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman upon the box, between whom and the coachman I was allowed\r\nto wedge myself, discovering that I was an American, put me many\r\nquestions, intended to be hard, with regard to our country, which I\r\nanswered as well as I could. He was a tall, well-dressed, reflective\r\nEnglishman, slightly inclined to be sarcastic and supercilious, but\r\nstudiously courteous in his manners, and speaking from half way down\r\nhis throat, with a gasping utterance, as is a fashion with some\r\nclergymen and very _elegant_ people here. He got at length, from more\r\ngeneral conversation, into a discussion upon the character of women,\r\nand the customs of our two countries with regard to them. He thought\r\nour way of treating women was an unreasonable petting of them, and\r\nthe tendency of it must be to spoil them, make them mere children,\r\ndelicacies, unfit to encounter in a manly way the inevitable trials\r\nof life, and unworthy of true respect. He thought, too, our customs,\r\nwith regard to them, were absurd and unjust; and told how a friend of\r\nhis had been obliged to lose his seat in a stage-coach and go outside,\r\nin a rainy day, because a girl that was picked up on the road wanted\r\nit. His friend had been rudely treated because he hesitated to comply\r\nwith this absurd demand; and he concluded his account of the affair by\r\nsaying, that however distinguished for gallantry my countrymen might\r\nbecome by such tyranny, he could only see in it, as he did in many\r\nother American transactions, a want of that stern regard for justice\r\nfor which, he trusted, Englishmen would ever be known. I could hardly\r\nunderstand his deduction from the story; for it seemed to me quite\r\nright, if not what he called “just,” that if one of them must have\r\nbeen exposed to the inclemency of the weather, it should have been the\r\nman, as probably best able to bear it. But, rather doubting if I had\r\nunderstood him, I replied, half ironically, half sincerely, that I\r\nwould confess that I questioned if the _mass_ of my countrymen were not\r\ndeficient in this respect to the educated middle class of England.\r\n\r\nHe wondered that I should confine the inherent love of justice and\r\ntruth to any class of Englishmen, yet did not deny that, among the\r\nnobility, it might seem to have degenerated a great deal into a mere\r\nidolatry of the forms to which justice was reduced by law and custom.\r\nBut among the lowest classes, he argued, we should find the real\r\ncharacter of a people most naturally and unaffectedly manifested, and\r\nespecially in the common forms of speech and popular proverbs and\r\noutcries. Spontaneous love of justice, and indignation at injustice was\r\nevery where displayed by the lowest class in England, and nowhere else\r\nin the world would you hear the demand for fair play so continually.\r\nHe had often noticed that, in any street tumult, the loudest shout was\r\nalways—“HANDS OFF! FAIR PLAY!” It always pleased him and made him proud\r\nof his country when he heard it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE RING—FEMININE._]\r\n\r\n“Let me tell you under what circumstances I heard it, not long\r\nsince—the only time I have as yet heard it in England,” I answered. “It\r\nwas in the ‘Bull-ring’ at Ludlow, the other day, one woman accused\r\nanother of cheating, and in return was called a liar. Just as we were\r\npassing, they came to blows, and hammered each other very severely.\r\nA crowd collected, and formed a ring about them in a moment. It was\r\nour impulse, with two or three other persons, of perhaps too weak a\r\nsense of justice, to rush in and part them; but the crowd were greatly\r\nenraged, and raised the cry, ‘Hands off! fair play!’ so that we were\r\nin danger of being rather roughly handled ourselves. They fought like\r\ntigers, till the blood ran freely. At length the hair of one of them\r\nfell over her face.”\r\n\r\n“Tut—tut!” said the coachman.\r\n\r\n“And as she tossed her head backwards, and tried to draw it off with\r\none hand, she got a facer; and then, _one, two, three!_—down she went!\r\n‘Fair play!’ shouted the crowd again, and caught up the victor and bore\r\nher off with a hurrah to a butcher’s shop. The fallen woman was picked\r\nup and lifted into a tinker’s cart; men and women crowded about her,\r\nand told her it was all along of her having her hair fall, and it was a\r\nfoul blow, and better luck next time. One brought a comb, another a mug\r\nof water, and another a little black bottle. In a minute—”\r\n\r\n“_Time!_” said the coachman, as if reminding his horses.\r\n\r\n“In a minute she had her face washed; tobacco crowded up her nose to\r\nstaunch the blood; her hair drawn tightly back, and knotted, and had\r\ntaken a good pull at the bottle.”\r\n\r\n“_Up to time!_” whispered coachee.\r\n\r\n“And the last we saw of her, she was standing before the butcher’s\r\nshop, with her sleeves rolled up, sparring in a scientific style, and\r\nscreaming, ‘Come on! come on! Give me fair play, and I’ll fight you.\r\nOh! I’ll fight you! only give me fair play!’ and all the crowd were\r\nshouting, ‘Fair fight! fair fight! Come out! come out and give her fair\r\nfight!’”\r\n\r\n“It must have been a nuisance—such a rabble; where were the police?”\r\n\r\n“In America, all the men in sight would have been policemen, if\r\nnecessary, to have parted them.”\r\n\r\n“Don’t you like fair fighting, then,—you Americans?” asked the coachman.\r\n\r\n“Why—we don’t like fighting at all among women. It is disgraceful!\r\nSurely the idea of women fighting so brutally is disgusting to you?”\r\n\r\n“Disgusting? I don’t know that. There’s _Joan of Arc_, and _Amazon_,\r\nand other handsome heroines; they are not disgusting, are they? I tell\r\nyou, sir, I do like a fair, stand-up fight, and, _damme_, sir, I don’t\r\nknow, by your leave, why women have not the right to settle their\r\nquarrels that way as well as men.”\r\n\r\n“The right—yes; and if they must fight, let it be a fair fight; but\r\nI would rather men would fight for them. Fighting!—a man could drive\r\na coach as well, I suppose, or fell a tree as well after fighting\r\nas before; but a woman could not sooth a child, nor would she feel\r\ndisposed to take tender care of one, I think, if her fighting\r\npropensities had been much cultivated—whether in fair fighting or foul.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you are quite right, sir, quite right,” said the gentleman on my\r\nleft; “women should not be allowed to fight. But what application has\r\nit to my friend’s being turned out of his seat because a woman did not\r\nwish to get wet?”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SOCIAL DIFFERENCES._]\r\n\r\n“Why, I was thinking that if we sometimes show a less commanding\r\ninstinct of justice in our customs towards women, as you have thought\r\nfrom that incident, we may also exhibit a more delicate sense of\r\npropriety and fitness, which, if it does not rest on an instinct of\r\njustice, certainly does on something nearly akin to it. You find no\r\nmob in America that would look on and see two women fight like that.\r\nBut, indeed, you’d never see American women fighting so. If it is a\r\ndisgrace to us that we have made our women unnaturally childlike, it is\r\nno honour to you that yours can be so unnaturally brutish.”\r\n\r\n“But, my dear sir, that was a tinker’s wife!”\r\n\r\n“So it was, and I should perhaps have confined the application to your\r\nlower classes; I certainly have never seen any want of true refinement\r\namong your well-bred ladies.”\r\n\r\n“But they do tell strange tales of your fine ladies. I suppose you have\r\nseen the _legs_ of pianos put in pantalettes?”\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, frequently; and do you know—the other day, at the residence of\r\nthe Honourable Mrs. ——”\r\n\r\n“—— Hall? The family are on the Continent.”\r\n\r\n“Yes; I did not see the ladies; but will you believe me, sir, their\r\nmodesty is so great, that the _arms_ of their chairs are all in muslin\r\nsleeves, as well as their piano—body, legs, and all—veiled like a\r\nTurk’s wife, so you would not know what it was.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, to keep the dust off it—it must have been.”\r\n\r\n“_Undoubtedly._”\r\n\r\n“Ah! you mean that such was also the case with those you have seen in\r\nAmerica?”\r\n\r\n“Of course. It never occurred to me that they were covered for any\r\nother reason. I have no doubt that if your friend told you that they\r\nwere, he was made the subject of a practical joke. If not, he kept\r\nworse company than I ever fell among when he was there; and it is as\r\nunfair for you to draw a general conclusion with regard to our ladies,\r\nfrom his experience in a vulgar family or two, as it would be for me\r\nto describe your ladies as coarse and brutal from the conduct of the\r\ntinker’s wife.”\r\n\r\n“But tinkers’ wives would not be _piano-forte_ performers, nor\r\ntravellers in the inside of stage-coaches.”\r\n\r\n“I don’t know that,” I replied; “a tinker’s wife in the United States\r\nis as likely to know how to play a _piano-forte_, as a tinker’s wife\r\nhere is to know how to read her Bible, and would certainly be as\r\nlikely to ride in the inside of a stage-coach as any one else; and\r\nyour friend, if he had one for his _vis-à-vis_, might, very possibly,\r\nfrom her dress and general appearance, particularly from her general\r\ninformation and intelligence, have been led to apply the same standard\r\nin judging of her that he had been accustomed to use at home for\r\nfemales of his own rank in society: of course, judged in that way, it\r\nwould be odd if he could not find something _outré_ about her to make\r\nfun of.”\r\n\r\n“How about stage-coachmen’s wives, sir?”\r\n\r\n“I know a stage driver’s wife that has a piano, and can play it—at\r\nleast her daughter can—admirably well. Her husband is colonel of a\r\ncrack regiment of our yeomanry cavalry.”\r\n\r\nThe coachman turned and looked me very gravely in the face for a\r\nmoment, just showing the tip of his tongue, and then raised his hand\r\ntill his thumb pointed over his left shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman laughed, and said,\r\n\r\n“He will be ‘_His Excellency_,’ your representative at the Court of St.\r\nJames next, I suppose.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps so,” I answered, “for he has already represented his\r\nfellow-townsmen for two years in the Legislature of the State, and had\r\nthe title of Honourable.”\r\n\r\n“A stage-coachman, ’pon honour?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“What for a whip is he, sir?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll tell you his story, as far as I know it,[13] and what I don’t\r\nknow I can guess at.\r\n\r\n[13] There is some fiction in what follows,—necessarily introduced\r\nto enable me to give truthfully what I recollect of the actual\r\nconversation. I know more than one stage-driver who has had a seat\r\nin a State Legislature, and filled it with honour to himself and\r\nsatisfaction to his constituents. In its important points, the\r\nnarrative I have given is true.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _AN AMERICAN’S HISTORY._]\r\n\r\n“He was an ostler once, then a lawyer’s boy, then a schoolmaster,\r\nthen studied law and began to practice; then he _speculated_, made a\r\nfortune, and lost the greater part of it in a year; then he bought out\r\na line of stage-coaches that were run over a mountain, and which was\r\nabout to be given up because a railroad running around the mountains\r\nhad been completed. He put the fares down, and works them in opposition\r\nto the railroad; and, as it is a tight match, he drives one coach\r\nhimself, fifteen miles a-day, and back—six horses in hand; and I have\r\nseen them going down the mountain as hard as they could run, while he\r\nheld his reins in one hand, not tauter than yours are now, and his\r\ncigar in the other, and called out to them, one after another, by name,\r\nto look out for themselves or they’ll break their necks, as if they had\r\nbeen a squad of school children.”\r\n\r\n“Good God!” breathed the coachman.\r\n\r\n“He is, withal, a church elder, and Super, Grand, Past Superior, Most\r\nVenerable Senior Patriarch of the Independent Order of X. Y. Z., and a\r\nvariety of other things.”\r\n\r\nThe coachman _whistled_.\r\n\r\n“But the lady, sir, of this gentleman—I should like to hear more of\r\nher,” asked my other companion.\r\n\r\n“She is rather older than her husband—and, having had to work pretty\r\nhard all her life, has not had time to keep up with him, so she has the\r\ngood sense to stay in the background a good deal; but his daughter,\r\nwho is a beauty, accomplished, speaks French and German, and, as I\r\ntold you, performs finely on the piano, was a regular belle in the last\r\nlegislative session, and, they say, did a French Count the honour of\r\nrejecting his addresses.”\r\n\r\n“Polkas, waltzes and sch—”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no! I guess not—never, except with her younger sister, and in\r\ndomestic circles: she is really too modest, and I suppose she would say\r\nit was against her religious principles.”\r\n\r\n“She is religious, then?”\r\n\r\n“Really so, I believe. I heard that the Count was likely to be greatly\r\nchanged from her influence over him.”\r\n\r\n“Have you a daughter, coachman?”\r\n\r\n“Daughter! no! But I tell you, sir, I have the trimmest little King\r\nCharles’ slut you ever saw: black coat and tan wescoat, sir, with just\r\na frill of white that you could cover with a sixpence. She won me five\r\npuns at the last Bristol show.”\r\n\r\n“That’ll never connect you with a French Count.”\r\n\r\n“Bah! I don’t want any thing to do with Frenchmen.”\r\n\r\n“Why not?” said I. “I have seen but little of Frenchmen; what is it\r\nthat you have found so bad about them?”\r\n\r\n“I haven’t seen much of them either, and I don’t want to.”\r\n\r\n“_Why not?_”\r\n\r\n“Oh—why, they are a scurvy lot, sir—live on frogs and\r\n_pea-soup_!—and—eh?—_worship images, sir!_—and—eh?—_oh, they’ve\r\nno bottom, sir!_—no strength they haven’t got, no pluck, sir. One\r\nEnglishman’s worth a dozen of ’em, you know, sir.”\r\n\r\n“You are a true Briton, coachman,” said the gentleman, laughing.\r\n\r\n“We have some truer Britons on our side of the water; I’ll tell you\r\nwhat they sing.—\r\n\r\n                It often has been told\r\n                That the British sailors bold\r\n                Could flog the tars of France\r\n                            So handy oh!\r\n                They never met their match,\r\n                ’Till the Yankees did them catch;\r\n                Oh the Yankee tars for fighting\r\n                            Are the dandy oh!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _NATIONAL VANITIES._]\r\n\r\n“‘One Yankee is good for two Englishmen, and two Englishmen can lick a\r\ndozen Frenchmen.’ ‘The British can whip all creation, and we can whip\r\nthe British.’ That’s the talk of our ‘true Britons.’ Don’t you think\r\nthey are full-blooded?”\r\n\r\n“I must confess,” he answered, “that with all your suavity to women you\r\nare as stubborn and inconsistent in your prejudices as the worst of us.\r\nIf the lady, whose seat my friend was obliged to pay for, had but been\r\nof a dark complexion—”\r\n\r\n“Oh, now, do not let us discuss that subject—my friends and I only\r\ngo as far as the Queen’s Head, which must be near by now; and if we\r\nbegin on slavery we shall want the whole afternoon to get a good\r\nunderstanding of each other’s views. But what did you mean by your\r\nfriend’s paying the lady’s fare? I did not understand that before.”\r\n\r\n“What difference is it? He had paid for an inside seat, and, when he\r\nmost needed it, was obliged to give it up to her.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!—I think I understand you—that is the injustice that you feel.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir, it is; it seems strange to me that you do not at once\r\ninstinctively appreciate it.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you are not aware that there is no difference in price on the\r\noutside and the inside of a stage-coach in America, and the only right\r\nwhich one can have to a seat is that of priority—a right which is made\r\nby custom with regard to men, but does not hold when a woman is in the\r\ncase.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed! is it so?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“I ask your pardon; indeed, I was not aware of it. But it is singular\r\nthat it should be so; is not the privilege of protection from the\r\nweather worth paying for?”\r\n\r\n“Sometimes it is; but in our climate it is not usually. Most men\r\nprefer, and would be willing, one time with another, to pay more for\r\nthe elevated seat in the open air, than to be cramped up with eight\r\nothers (for our coaches carry nine inside) in a close, crowded cabin. I\r\nmyself cannot stand it for an hour, for it makes me _sea-sick_; and no\r\nmatter what the weather, I should go outside. I would rather be frozen\r\nthan suffocated. However, I suppose that our customs, as well as our\r\nlegal institutions, do give the rich a little less advantage over the\r\npoor than yours.”\r\n\r\n“And that’s just what institutions ought to do, if they do any thing,”\r\nput in the coachman; “what the devil else are they good for? It stands\r\nto reason: always dry off your weakest nag first, ’specially if he’s a\r\nlittle ailing. If you don’t, you’ll have trouble, you may depend, sir.”\r\n\r\n“There is always danger in interfering with the natural laws of\r\nproperty,” remarked the gentleman. “It does not answer to put beggars\r\non horseback, you know. All such things should be left to take their\r\nnatural course. Property is the natural representative of intelligence\r\nand virtue, and all laws and customs that tend to the unnatural\r\nelevation or peculiar advantage of particular persons or classes, are\r\nmischievous.”\r\n\r\n“I fully agree with you as to laws which obstruct the natural movement\r\nof property for merely individual aggrandizement. As a general rule,\r\nI believe all such attempts must fail of their real object. I don’t\r\nbelieve it possible, that such laws or restrictions should not be to\r\nthe eventual disadvantage of both parties.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _NATURAL LAWS._]\r\n\r\n“I declare I am glad to hear an American uttering such sentiments;\r\nbut, indeed, they are irresistible—so simply and clearly right,\r\nthat they seem, to one who has given any attention to the subject,\r\naltogether unworthy of discussion. But there is a still more evident\r\njustness, not to say policy, after one nation has opened her ports to\r\nfree competition, that she should not be excluded or restrained from\r\nthose of another. I do trust your nation begins to see how disgraceful\r\nto it is that false, absurd, unjust system of Protection, and will\r\nsoon reciprocate our more generous policy, and let our commercial\r\nintercourse be governed by the natural law of trade. The simple law of\r\nnature should be the law of nations.”\r\n\r\n“I am not so sure that Free Trade is a simple law of nature,” I\r\nanswered. “If that is the natural law, which you were saying that we\r\ninterfered with, in not allowing the rich man to separate himself\r\nas much as he chooses from the poor, then selfishness is the only\r\nreliable, natural guide, and the impulses of selfishness must not be\r\nthwarted by law. Might makes right—Every man for himself—that’s the\r\nlaw for you; quite a different thing from this you talk of—forgiving\r\nold scores and reciprocating the advantages you would give us, now\r\nthat you find it much the most for your interest to do so, whether we\r\nreciprocate or not.”\r\n\r\n“The first impulse of nature,” he replied, “is, every man for himself,\r\nperhaps; but the first true law of helping himself is to help another,\r\nto have a partner to labour with for a reciprocal advantage.”\r\n\r\n“I always heard self-preservation was the first law of nature,” said\r\nthe coachman.\r\n\r\n“Exactly,” said I; “self-preservation—or, in fact, selfishness—that’s\r\nthe first law,—not perfect reciprocity of good services, but the best\r\npayment we can get for our services. It’s the necessity of the buyer,\r\nnot his generosity, that governs the payment. You have followed this\r\nnatural law in your foreign policy as long as it would serve you,\r\nwithout regard to the injury it did us; now you find that a generous\r\npolicy would be the most profitable policy, you preach reciprocity,\r\nand call that a natural law; but our people say—No! You have had the\r\ngood—you must take the evil. If there’s any natural law, it is that\r\nby which we claim payment for the good we do you—atonement for the\r\ninjury you have done us. At any rate, you must wait a few years till we\r\nhave nursed our infant manufactures, not yet able to walk alone; when\r\nthey are well established, we will, perhaps, give you the fair field\r\nand fair fight you are so fond of. For the fact is, no one expects\r\nProtection to be more than a temporary policy with us.”\r\n\r\n“That’s fair,” said the coachman; “heavy weights and light weights\r\ncan’t go into the ring together.”\r\n\r\n“’Tisn’t heavy weights and light weights, but the champion of the world\r\nin full feather, calling out a youngster who’s never been in training.\r\nWe acknowledge that you have the advantage of us, in some respects;\r\nbut wait a bit, till we get in good trim, and then we will put our\r\ningenuity and activity against your experience and muscle.”\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile, you will take all the advantage that you can of your\r\nsuperior agricultural muscle, to undersell our farmers,” said the\r\nfree-trader.\r\n\r\n“No; you give it to us, because it is as much to your advantage as to\r\nours.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he answered, “we certainly do; and we advise you to do the same\r\nwith regard to manufactures, honestly believing that it would be as\r\nmuch for your advantage as ours. It is absurd, for the sake of revenge,\r\nthat you should pay your manufacturers a high price for what ours will\r\nfurnish you at a lower one....”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _NIMROD._]\r\n\r\n“She’s the best in the lot,” said the coachman, interrupting us, to\r\nexplain a severe cut he had given the near-wheeler; “the best in the\r\nlot, sir. Now she’s woke up, see how she throws her weight in. I’ve\r\nbeen working a coach, off and on, these fifteen years, and I don’t\r\nthink I ever had a better bit of stuff before me; but you saw how she\r\nwas lagging. She isn’t sulky—kind as a kitten—never takes offence—and\r\nshe don’t mean she’s ailing; but sometimes she gets into a kind of a\r\ndoze; forgets herself, and don’t hear me; dreamy like, I consider;\r\nthinking about the last stable, instead of the one she’s going to. I\r\ncan’t break her of it. But she’s tough as steel—‘_Lady Nimrod_’ we\r\ncalls her—after the old Nimrod, you know, sir, as writes for Bell’s\r\nLife. Ah, sir! but he can write, can’t he, _and no chaff_! You’ve read\r\nthe Northern Tour; that distinguished old whip, you remember, that he\r\ntells of, he was my nuncle,—it’s in our blood,—he was a working on the\r\nNorthern then.”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n“I must beg leave,” said the gentleman, resuming our discussion, “to\r\ndeny that we have been governed by such an exclusively selfish policy,\r\nin that matter of Free Trade and Protection, as you imputed to us.\r\nThe principles of Free Trade are the natural laws of the universe,\r\napplicable at all times to all places. I fully believe that it would\r\nhave been as profitable for our ancestors to have adopted them, as\r\nit is for us; and so far from ascribing their success to protection,\r\nI should say that it was in spite of Protection, and due only to\r\nindomitable energy and perseverance. And I feel no manner of doubt,\r\nthat Protection, so far from encouraging your manufacturers, can only\r\nrest as an incubus upon their ingenuity and energy.”\r\n\r\n“However your manufacturing success may have been affected by mere\r\nprotection in itself, there can be no question that the great vantage\r\nground that you have now in competing with us, is in the low cost of\r\nyour manual labour. And this, if not due to technical protection,\r\nhas certainly resulted, in a great degree, from that general policy\r\nin your past history, of sustaining _privileged classes_; from\r\nyour constitution and laws and customs making, or, if you please,\r\n_permitting_, the accident of birth to give such advantages to some\r\nas it does. I do not consider property as the representative of\r\nindustry and intelligence merely; it might be more truly defined as the\r\nrepresentative of power, and often of the power of rascality and low\r\ncunning: the State, therefore, instead of giving artificial privileges\r\nto the rich, should, if to either class, give it to the poorer, because\r\nthe weaker.”\r\n\r\n“The State should grant no artificial distinctions; but there are\r\ncertain privileges and distinctions which a man may _naturally_\r\nacquire, and the State should guarantee him permanent possession of\r\nthese.”\r\n\r\n“Granted, with the qualification that he must acquire them, and hold\r\nthem in no way which, on the whole, shall be adverse to the greatest\r\ngood of the greatest number. Now _position_, socially, is relative:\r\nif you elevate one man, you degrade others. Superior necessitates\r\ninferior. The aristocracy of the few makes necessary the peasantry of\r\nthe many. Is that the Queen’s Head?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Our discussion must be interrupted, then.”\r\n\r\n“Excuse me,” said our friend from behind us, reaching forward and\r\nputting his hand on my shoulder—“excuse me, but did I not hear you\r\nspeaking of selfishness and revenge as first laws of nature, just now?”\r\n\r\n“Something of the kind.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE NEW LAW._]\r\n\r\n“You will allow me to remind you that they are the natural laws of\r\nbrutes, and of man in his first stages of progress from the brutal\r\nstate. Was it not to a semi-barbarian people, incapable of being\r\ngoverned by a higher and better law, because they could not appreciate\r\nor have faith in it, that God permitted the law of an eye for an eye,\r\nand a tooth for a tooth?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, certainly,” said I; “I would not seriously argue that we should\r\ngovern ourselves by that law—I was speaking carelessly.”\r\n\r\n“I knew you were, and that you would not wish to leave such an\r\nimpression—”\r\n\r\n“And may we not hope,” continued our friend, in his mild, serious way,\r\n“may we not hope that nations, like individuals, may take upon them a\r\nnew and regenerated nature, and be governed by the higher law, ‘Do unto\r\nothers as you would that they should do unto you?’ It was faith in this\r\n_true_ law of wise and happy existence, both for God and man, which\r\nmoved Jesus Christ, in the midst of disgrace, agony, and death, even\r\nin his last extremity, with fainting breath, to desire and labour for\r\nthe salvation of those to whose ignorance of this law he owed all his\r\nsuffering; and in this complete victory over the old law of revengeful\r\npayment, it should have passed away together with the brutal idea of\r\nGod with which it had been necessarily connected; and now, to us, with\r\na higher revelation of God as our Father, there should be a new and\r\nhigher law.”\r\n\r\n“Right,” said I, “and just what I would have been glad, if I had not\r\ngot astray, to bring our argument to. It is not the law of nature,\r\nwhich is selfishness, but the law of God, which is _love_, that we\r\nshould make the law of nations.”\r\n\r\n“But, sir,” answered the free-trader, “is not the true law of nature\r\nidentical with the law of God? It is in ignorance that men have hoped\r\nto benefit themselves by injuring others. Love is but a wise man’s\r\nselfishness. If I work rightly for myself, I cannot help but that you\r\nshall be benefited also.”\r\n\r\n“The long and short of it is,” added our friend, “that while carefully\r\nremembering our individual responsibility, we should always be working\r\ntogether in love, as brothers, having a common inheritance; knowing\r\nthat over all is a common Father, guiding and directing all, not only\r\nfor the common good, but, with impartial love for each of his children,\r\nfor the highest good of each individual. So must we, as nations, each\r\npeople for itself, yet each for the common good of all, and knowing\r\nthat only in the good of all can be the good of any. So only can any\r\nnation expect to prosper long, and so only shall the world prepare,\r\ntoo, for the universal kingdom of God—the coming of which may He\r\ngraciously hasten!”\r\n\r\n“Amen!” said the man who occupied the seat behind us, with my brother\r\nand our friend. From his moody expression and his position, his\r\nforehead resting on his hand, I had before thought him ill. I now\r\nturned again to look at him, and saw that either his eyes were very\r\nswollen and weak, or he had been weeping. “Excuse me for listening to\r\nyou,” he said, speaking English very distinctly at first—“I have been\r\nmuch interest in your converse; I am a Frenchman,” and he raised his\r\ncap. At this the coachman turned short round and looked him in the\r\nface. “Will you permit me the honour of to take your hand?” Here he\r\ngave his left hand to each of us successively, and finally offered to\r\ndo so with the coachman, who said:—\r\n\r\n“I don’t say any thing behind a man’s back that I’m afraid to before\r\nhis face, and I don’t like a Frenchman any way.”\r\n\r\n“That is very good—very honest, which please me—coachman; so now I like\r\nyou, you will make my friend—very good.”\r\n\r\n“Tchiup!” answered the coachman, turning towards his horses, and the\r\nbrown mare being again in a brown study, he snatched the whip and woke\r\nher up with a smart cut.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _MATCH FOR A FRENCHMAN._]\r\n\r\n“I am made very happy,” the Frenchman continued, “very happy that you\r\nso do like the grand idea of the fraternity of nations; and for that\r\ngood time, which shall surely come, I do, with you, make the prayer\r\nthat it be quickly. Ah! gentlemen—with what—‘like many waters’—spake\r\nthe God-voice through my people that word the other year, _Fraternité!_\r\nwhat you call the Brotherhood, and with it Liberty and Equality.\r\nIndividuality, its rights; association, its love, its opportunity! Ah!\r\ngentlemen, ah! sir, I have not ever in England heard so good words\r\nas those you speaked. Ah! mine friend, I do feel you mine brother to\r\nbe! Ah! _mon cher ami, certainement_—do you know your religion is my\r\nreligion—_Dieu est charité!_ Ah! mine friends, I very much communion\r\nhave with you——And my country, in which was those good word spoken.\r\n_Ah, mon Dieu! ah, mon Dieu! ma belle France! ma belle France! porquoi!\r\nporquoi!_” and the poor little man broke down.\r\n\r\n“Jerusalem! oh Jerusalem! that slayest thy prophets!” said our friend,\r\ndrawing his head upon his shoulder, and then going on in a low tone\r\nexpressive of sympathy and consolation, of which I could not hear the\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n“Ptshut!—Baby!” said the coachman.\r\n\r\n“Baby?” said I. “Yes, ‘for of such is the kingdom of heaven.’”\r\n\r\n“Just what I told you, sir.” He went on growling, not having understood\r\nme. “No bottom, sir, _no bottom_! ... and a man _can’t_ fight, you know,\r\nwithout _bottom_.... Pooh! regular women! ... See the hair round his\r\nmouth!—snob! ... How the devil does he ever get the soup into it? ...——if\r\nI wouldn’t match the Queen’s Head bar-maid against the best man amongst\r\nthem. ... They may make a goodish brush at the start, you know, sir,\r\nbut they _can’t sweat it through_, ... no, sir, they _can not_. ... They\r\nare a bad lot, you may _depend_, sir—never _can_ make a good fight.”\r\n\r\n“Pshaw, man! there’s something else to be done in the world than\r\nfighting.”\r\n\r\n“But a man isn’t worth much at any thing else if he can’t fight when he\r\nis put to it, if you please, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense! there’s good stuff in plenty of men that never show\r\nfight—don’t you know that? But you might bet on this man’s being a\r\nfighter—look at his scars, and you see his right arm is gone—ten to one\r\nhe lost it fighting.”\r\n\r\n“Well, that does look some’at plucky—it’s a fact, sir—so-ho,\r\nlads—steady—whoo! Now then, Blazer! look alive!”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ALL RIGHT._]\r\n\r\nThese last words were for the red-headed ostler of the Queen’s Arms.\r\nThe four fresh horses with blankets over their harness stood waiting;\r\nBlazer looked most intensely alive, and in a marvellously short space\r\nof time the old team was unhitched and walking off unattended to\r\nthe stable; my brother was saying a few kind parting words to the\r\nFrenchman, who answered that he trusted that they were representative\r\nof the sentiments of all the good American people; the free-trader\r\nhanded me his card, saying that he observed that I had an agricultural\r\ntaste—if I should be passing through and could find it convenient to\r\ncall on him, though not in that line himself, he thought he could\r\nshow me some things in the neighbourhood that would interest me. The\r\ncoachman had forgotten us, and all about him, in a kind of doze, as\r\nhe said, of the brown mare. Making an estimate, I guessed he was,\r\nwith regard to the Queen’s Head bar-maid, of the exact height she\r\nwas in her stockings, and the exact weight to which he could bring\r\nher if he could have the training of her for a month. His mind\r\nseemed totally abstracted as we pointed a shilling towards him;\r\nbut he took it, mechanically touching his hat and saying, ‘Thankee,\r\nsir.’ The redoubtable damsel herself stood on the porch of the inn,\r\nlooking poutingly at the coachman (or the Frenchman’s moustache)—not\r\na dangerous person, to judge by her appearance, though she must\r\nhave stood full six feet in her stout hob-nailed shoes, but with as\r\ngood-natured and healthy a soul looking out of her great hazel eyes as\r\nthe mildest pot of half-and-half she had ever honoured the Queen’s Head\r\nby drawing in its cellar.\r\n\r\nThe fresh horses were fastened to, and the guard had shouted “All\r\nright!” before we were all three fairly on the ground. Yet a moment\r\nlonger Blazer held the pawing leaders, while the coachman, with a\r\ncompletely nonplussed expression, lighted a cigar that the Frenchman\r\nhad given him; then, as we were buckling on our knapsacks, he drew taut\r\nhis reins, and away they bounded, the Frenchman bending far over to\r\nkiss his hand to us, and the Englishman in a stately way lifting his\r\nhat.\r\n\r\n“Adieu, mes amis, adieu!”\r\n\r\n“God be with the brother, as surely he will.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHADY LANES.—RURAL SKETCHES.—HEREFORDSHIRE AND MONMOUTHSHIRE\r\nSCENERY.—POINTS OF DIFFERENCE IN ENGLISH AND AMERICAN LANDSCAPES.—\r\nVISIT TO A FARM-HOUSE.—THE MISTRESS.—THE FARM-HOUSE GARDEN.—A\r\nSTOUT OLD ENGLISH FARMER.—THE STABLES AND STOCK.—TURNIP\r\nCULTURE.—SHEEP.—WHEAT.—HAY.—RENTS.—PRICES.—A PARTING.—CIDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe soon turned off the main road, and pursued our way for several miles\r\nby narrow, deep, shady lanes, our conductor giving us much information\r\nabout the agriculture of the district and the habits and character of\r\nthe people, ever and anon, also, finding occasion from some incident\r\nor spectacle that engaged our attention, for instructive and godly\r\ndiscourse, in such a way as I have endeavoured to show his habit in the\r\nlast chapter; not tediously, and to the interruption of other thoughts\r\nand conversation, but naturally and cheerfully.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _RURAL SCENES._]\r\n\r\nIt was a rarely clear, bright, sunshiny afternoon, and while on the\r\nbroad highway we found, for the first time in England, the temperature\r\nof the air more than comfortably warm. The more agreeable were the\r\nlanes;—narrow, deep, and shady, as I said, often not wider than the\r\ncart-track, and so deep, that the grassy banks on each side were higher\r\nthan our heads; our friend could not explain how or why they were made\r\nso, but probably it was by the rain washing through them for centuries.\r\nOn the banks, too, were thickly scattered the flowers of heart’s-ease,\r\nforget-me-not, and wild strawberries; above, and out of them, grew the\r\nhawthorn hedges in thick but wild and wilsome verdure, and pushing out\r\nof this, and stretching over us, often the branches mingling over our\r\nheads and shutting out the bright blue sky clear beyond the next turn,\r\nso we seemed walking in a bower, thick old apple and pear trees with\r\npliant twigs of hazel-wood, and occasionally the strong arms of great\r\nbending elms. Now and then a break in the hedge-row, and, a little\r\nback, a low, thick-thatched cottage with many bends in the ridge-pole,\r\nand little windows, and thick walls; a cat asleep in the door, and\r\npigs and chickens before it, and, lying on the ground, in the dust of\r\nthe lane, playing with a puppy, two or three flaxen-haired, blue-eyed\r\nchildren; a little further, a drowsy old she-ass standing in the shade,\r\nand a mouse-coloured foal, as little as a lamb, but with a great\r\nhead and large, plaintive dark eyes, and a most confiding, meek, and\r\ntouching expression of infantile, embryo intellect.\r\n\r\nNow and then, too, the hedge gives way to the wall of a paddock or\r\nstack-yard, and beyond it are a number of old and often dilapidated\r\nhovels, sheds, and stables, clustering without any appearance of\r\narrangement about a low farm-house with big chimneys, wide windows, and\r\na little porch half hidden under roses, jessamine, and honeysuckle.\r\n\r\nAnd sometimes at these a big dog would bay at us, and, a woman coming\r\nto the door, our friend would turn up and ask, “How is _the master_\r\nand the little ones?” and in return be asked, “How is good mistress\r\nand young master?” And then we would be presented as strangers, that\r\nhad come over the sea to view this goodly land, and would be asked, in\r\npitying tones, about famine, and fever, and potatoes, the farm-wife,\r\nalthough she had an exceedingly sweet speech, apparently confusing New\r\nYork with Connaught or Munster.\r\n\r\nAgain, broad fields, and stout horses, and busy labourers, and straight\r\nplough-furrows, or the bright metallic green of luxuriant young wheat\r\nand barley in broad glades of glancing light; and a stout old man,\r\nwho waddles towards us with a warm greeting, also wiping the sweat\r\nfrom his brow, and mounting “a goodish bit of stuff, though she has\r\nseen twenty winters,” rides for a little way along with us, breathing\r\nhard and speaking huskily; grumbling, grumbling at every opening in\r\nthe conversation at Free Trade and high rents, but answering all our\r\nquestions about his draining, and boneing, and drilling, and dibbling,\r\nand very frankly acknowledging how much he has been able to increase\r\nhis crops with new-fashioned ways and new-fangled implements.\r\n\r\nThen leaving the lane, we take a foot-path, which, crossing the hedges\r\nby stiles, leads through old orchards, in all of which horses and\r\ncattle are pasturing; and there are beautiful swells of the ground,\r\nand sometimes deep swales of richer green, with rushes and willows\r\ngrowing at the bottom. Reaching a steeper hill-side, we enter a large\r\nplantation of young forest trees, and soon pass all at once into an\r\nolder growth of larger and more thinly standing wood; and near the\r\ntop of this, find a clearing, where men are making faggots of the\r\nbrushwood, and stripping bark from the larger sticks, and some little\r\nboys and girls are picking up chips and putting them into sacks.\r\n\r\nWe reach another lane and cultivated fields again, and, being on\r\nelevated ground, at the knarly feet of a glorious, breezy, gray, old\r\nbeech-tree, lay ourselves down, and, looking back upon the extensive\r\nlandscape, tell our friend in what it differs from American scenery.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _LANDSCAPE PECULIARITIES._]\r\n\r\nThe great beauty and peculiarity of the English landscape is to be\r\nfound in the frequent long, graceful lines of deep green hedges\r\nand hedge-row timber, crossing hill, valley, and plain, in every\r\ndirection; and in the occasional large trees, dotting the broad\r\nfields, either singly or in small groups, left to their natural open\r\ngrowth, (for ship-timber, and, while they stand, for castle shades,)\r\ntherefore branching low and spreading wide, and more beautiful, much\r\nmore beautiful, than we often allow our trees to make themselves.\r\nThe less frequent brilliancy of broad streams or ponds of water,\r\nalso distinguishes the prospect from those we are accustomed to,\r\nthough there are often small brooks or pools, and much marshy land,\r\nand England may be called a well-watered country. In the foreground\r\nyou will notice the quaint buildings, generally pleasing objects in\r\nthemselves, often supporting what is most agreeable of all, and that\r\nyou can never fail to admire, never see any thing ugly or homely\r\nunder, a curtain of ivy or other creepers; the ditches and the\r\nbanks by their side, on which the hedges are planted; the clean and\r\ncareful cultivation, and general tidiness of the agriculture; and\r\nthe deep, narrow, crooked, gulche-like lane, or the smooth, clean,\r\nmatchless, broad highway. Where trees are set in masses for ornament,\r\nthe Norway spruce and the red beech generally give a dark, ponderous\r\ntone, which we seldom see in America; and in a hilly and unfertile\r\ncountry there are usually extensive patches of the larch, having a\r\nbrown hue. The English elm is the most common tree in small parks or\r\nabout country-houses. It appears, at a little distance, more like our\r\nhickory, when the latter grows upon a rich soil, and is not cramped, as\r\nsometimes in our river intervals, than any other American tree.\r\n\r\nThere seems to me to be a certain peculiarity in English foliage,\r\nwhich I can but little more than allude to, not having the skill to\r\ndescribe. You seem to see each particular leaf, (instead of a confused\r\nleafiness,) more than in our trees; or it is as if the face of each\r\nleaf was parallel, and more equally lighted than in our foliage. It is\r\nperhaps only owing to a greater density, and better filling up, and\r\nmore even growth of the outer twigs of the trees, than is common in\r\nour drier climate. I think that our maple woods have more resemblance\r\nto it than others.\r\n\r\nThere is usually a much milder light over an English landscape than an\r\nAmerican, and the distances and shady parts are more indistinct. It is\r\nrare that there is not a haziness, slightly like that of our Indian\r\nsummer, in the atmosphere, and the colours of every thing, except of\r\nthe foliage, are less brilliant and vivacious than we are accustomed\r\nto. The sublime or the picturesque in nature is much more rare in\r\nEngland, except on the sea-coast, than in America; but there is every\r\nwhere a great deal of quiet, peaceful, graceful beauty, which the\r\nworks of man have generally added to, and which I remember but little\r\nat home that will compare with. This Herefordshire reminds me of the\r\nvalley of Connecticut, between Middletown and Springfield. The valley\r\nof the Mohawk and the upper part of the Hudson, is also in some parts\r\nEnglish-like.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE FARM-HOUSE._]\r\n\r\nDescending into a broad, low tract of dale-land, we came at length to\r\nthe farm occupied by a relative of our guide, which we were going to\r\nvisit. A branch of the lane in which we had been for some time walking,\r\nran through the farm, and terminated at the farm-house. It was more\r\npicturesque and inconvenient, deeper, narrower, and muddier, than\r\nany we had before been through. It was explained to us that it was a\r\n“parish road”—although leading to but one house—and, therefore, the\r\nfarmer was not responsible for its bad repair.[14] Great trees grew up\r\nat its side, and these the farmer was not allowed to fell or trim—the\r\nlandlord estimating the value of their increase as timber or for fuel,\r\nor their advantage as a nursery of game, higher than the injury they\r\ncaused to the crops in the adjoining fields. Near the house the road or\r\nlane widened, and one side was lined by a thick symmetrical yew-hedge,\r\nseparating it from a garden; on the other side, however, the trees and\r\nhigh bank still continued, and two stout horses were straining every\r\nmuscle to draw a cart-load of crushed bones through the mire, which\r\nreached close up to the gable-end of the house. Opposite the house was\r\na cider-mill, cart-sheds, and some stacks: behind it, a large court,\r\nsurrounded by stables, sties, dairy-house, malt-house, granary, &c.\r\nInto this enclosure we passed by a great gate: a considerable part of\r\nit was occupied by a large heap of manure and a pool of green stagnant\r\nliquid. The buildings were mostly old, some of them a good deal\r\ndecayed, with cracks in the brick-work, timber bending and sustained by\r\nprops and other patch-work, which spake better for the tenant than his\r\nlandlord.\r\n\r\n[14] In the proceedings of a Parliamentary Commission of the last\r\ncentury, the following questions and answers are recorded:\r\n\r\n_Q._ What sort of roads have you in Monmouthshire?\r\n\r\n_A._ None at all.\r\n\r\n_Q._ How do you travel then?\r\n\r\n_A._ In ditches.—_Survey of Monmouth._\r\n\r\nBy a wide open door, directly from this filthy yard, we passed without\r\nceremony into the kitchen—a large, long room with stone floor, black\r\nbeams across the low ceiling, from which hung sides and hams of pork, a\r\nhigh settle, as usual, but not the ordinary kitchen display of bright\r\nmetal and crockery. Old and well worn, every thing, but neat and nice\r\nas brand-new. On a table was a huge loaf with a large piece of cold\r\nfat bacon and a slice of cheese, and directly a maid came up from the\r\ncellar and added to these viands a pint of foaming beer—dinner or\r\nsupper for the carter just returning from the town, whither he had gone\r\nearly in the morning with a load of wool, and had now brought back\r\nbone-manure.\r\n\r\nWe are seated in a little parlour, and the “wench” (a buxom\r\nserving-maid) goes to call the mistress. The parlour is a small\r\nroom neatly furnished, but not as expensively as it would be in\r\nmost substantial farmers’ houses with us; painted deal chairs, a\r\npainted-calico-covered lounge, the floor carpeted, and the walls\r\npapered; an oak writing-desk, a table, and a sewing-stand; no\r\nnewspapers or books, but a family-bible on the mantel and an almanac on\r\nthe desk; a door and a window open from it upon the flower-garden.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the mistress enters, and, after kindly receiving us,\r\nrings a bell, and, when the maid comes, gives her a key and tells her\r\nto bring cider. After short refreshment, she takes us into the garden.\r\nA pleasant garden, with some very large and fine pansies, some roses,\r\nand great promise of more. It is extremely neat, clean, and finely\r\nkept, and it is the pride of the mistress that she takes the entire\r\ncare of it herself; as we walk, she has her scissors in her hand, and\r\ncuts flowers, and when we are seated in a curious little arbour of\r\nclipped yew, where she had left her “work” when she came in to see us,\r\nshe arranges little nosegays and presents them to us.\r\n\r\nThe house is small in size; the walls are of plain red brick; the roof\r\nof slate, neither very steep-pitched nor flat; the chimneys and windows\r\nof the usual simple American country-house form and size. There is no\r\nporch, veranda, gable, or dormer, upon the garden side, yet the house\r\nhas a very pleasing and tasteful aspect, and does not at all disfigure\r\nthe lovely landscape of distant woody hills, against which we see it.\r\nFive shillings’ worth of materials from a nursery, half-a-day’s labour\r\nof a man, and some recreative work of our fair and healthy hostess’ own\r\nhands, have done it vastly better than a carpenter or mason could at a\r\nthousand times the cost. Three large evergreen trees have grown near\r\nthe end of the house, so that, instead of the plain, straight, ugly\r\nred corner, you see a beautiful, irregular, natural, tufty tower of\r\nverdure; myrtle and jessamine clamber gracefully upon a slight trellis\r\nof laths over the door; roses are trained up about one of the lower\r\nwindows, honeysuckle about another, while all the others, above and\r\nbelow, are deeply draped and festooned with the ivy, which, starting\r\nfrom a few slips thrust one day into the soil by the mistress, near the\r\ncorner opposite the evergreens, has already covered two-thirds of the\r\nbare brick wall on this side, found its way over the top of the tall\r\nyew-hedge, round the corner, climbed the gable-end, and is now creeping\r\nalong the ridge-pole and up the kitchen chimney—which, before speaking\r\nonly of boiled bacon and potatoes, now suggests happy holly-hangings of\r\nthe fireside and grateful harvest’s home, hides all the formal lines\r\nand angles, breaks all the stiff rules of art, dances lightly over the\r\ngrave precision of human handiwork, softens, shades, and shelters all\r\nunder a gorgeous vesture of Heaven’s own weaving.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE STABLES._]\r\n\r\nSoon, while we are sitting in this leafy boudoir, comes _the master_,\r\nas good a specimen of the stout, hearty, old English farmer as we\r\nshall find, and we go—the lady and all—to look at the horses, cows,\r\nand pigs. The stables are mostly small, inconveniently separated, and\r\nbadly fitted up, and there is but little in them to boast of in the\r\nway of cattle; but there is one new building, incongruously neat among\r\nthe rest, and in this there are some roomy stalls, with iron mangers,\r\nsliding neck-chains, and asphalte floor with grates and drain. Here was\r\nthe best stock of the farm: among the rest, a fine, fat Hereford cow,\r\nwhich had just been sold to the butcher for $60, and a handsome heifer\r\nof the same blood, heavy with calf, which had been lately bought for\r\n$15, the farmer chuckling as he passes his hand over her square rump,\r\nas if it had been a shrewd purchase. He valued his best dairy cow at\r\n$45.\r\n\r\nWe then go to the cider-mill and the sheds to look at some implements;\r\nnext to the ground, at some distance, where the labourers are all at\r\nwork ridging for turnips, (Swedes, or _Ruta-baga_.) The larger part\r\nof the field is already planted, and in some other fields the young\r\nplants are coming up. The crop of the farm this year is to be grown on\r\n_one hundred acres_, the whole area of the farm being less than three\r\nhundred.\r\n\r\nThe soil of this field is a fine, light, pliable loam. It has been\r\nthe year previous in wheat; the stubble was turned under soon after\r\nharvest with a skim-coulter-plough, an instrument that pairs off the\r\nsurface before the mould-board of the plough and throws it first to the\r\nbottom of the furrow: the operation may be described as a superficial\r\ntrench-ploughing; cross-ploughed and scarified again the same season\r\nwith one of the instruments described at page 182, Vol. I. In the\r\nspring, ploughed again, (eight inches deep,) harrowed fine and smooth,\r\nthrown into ridges with double mould-board plough, rolled, and finally\r\ndrilled with a two-horse machine that deposits and covers manure and\r\nseed together. The manure is ground bones, costing in Hereford 60½\r\ncents a bushel, mixed with sifted coal-ashes. The expense of this\r\napplication is about $12 an acre, but it must be remembered that the\r\nground is already in high condition. The drills are thirty inches\r\napart. The crop is principally used to fatten sheep, of which 500 are\r\nkept on the farm; the breed, Cotswold and Leicester.\r\n\r\nWe next went to a paddock in which were six Cotswold “tups,” (bucks,)\r\nas handsome sheep (of their kind) as I ever saw. One of them I caught\r\nand measured: girth behind the shoulders, exactly five feet; length\r\nfrom muzzle to tail, four feet and eleven inches.\r\n\r\nThen to the wheat, of which there was also about one hundred acres,\r\npart after turnips and part after potatoes: the former, which had been\r\nboned, looked the best. A part of the land had been prepared by a\r\n_presser_, (a kind of roller used to give solidity to light soils,) and\r\nthis was decidedly superior to the remainder. Most of the wheat was put\r\nin with drilling machines, of which there were two used, one sowing at\r\ngreater intervals than the other. Some of the wheat upon the pressed\r\nland, after turnips, was the finest we have seen. The farmer expected\r\nit to yield forty bushels of seventy pounds each, but would consider an\r\naverage of thirty, from the hundred acres, a very good crop. He said\r\nthe average crop of the county was thought to be but eighteen and a\r\nhalf bushels.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PRICES._]\r\n\r\nWalked through some pastures and a grass-field, and examined the hay\r\nin stacks; mostly rye-grass. The hay-fields yielded one to two and a\r\nquarter tons an acre, the average being under two tons. It took about\r\nfour days to cure it after cutting, and the whole cost of hay-making\r\nwas about four dollars an acre. Hay from the stack, of the best\r\nquality, would sell at this time in the city of Hereford for twelve\r\ndollars a-ton.\r\n\r\nThe rent of this farm was seven dollars and a half an acre; tithes, one\r\ndollar and a quarter an acre; road-rates, seventy cents an acre; all\r\npaid by the farmer, together with poor-rates and other burdens.\r\n\r\nA good pair of sound, well-broken, but rather light, cart-horses, cost\r\nhere $185; horse-cart, $60; harness and gear for each horse, $12. A\r\nsmith will keep a horse shod for $5 a year. Insurance of horses in the\r\nRoyal Farmers’ Company, 2½ per cent. of value _per annum_.\r\n\r\nAfter taking tea at the farm-house, our kind guide, Brother ——, made\r\nready to depart by stuffing some tracts, publications of the Brethren,\r\nmostly of a meditative character, into our packs; we might learn more\r\nof their ideas from them, he said, and if they did not interest us, or\r\nafter we had read them, it might do some one else good to leave them\r\nat the inns where we stopped, or in the public conveyances. He begged\r\nus if we got into any trouble or needed any assistance for any purpose\r\nwhile in England, to let him know; and so we parted. We had never heard\r\nof this man, nor he of us, till twenty-four hours before. He had then\r\nmerely received word that three American Christians—wayfarers—would\r\nbe passing through his town that night, and so he came out into the\r\nhighway seeking for us, found us, and had so entertained us as I have\r\nshown. He would now walk several miles alone and return home by the\r\nnight-coach.\r\n\r\nThe farmer now had his favourite greyhound let out for us to see, and\r\nafter another short stroll, finding that we were bent upon leaving him\r\nthat night, insisted on our coming to the garden again and tasting some\r\nchoice cider made from the _Hagloe crab_—the pure juice he assured us\r\nit was—a good wholesome English drink: a baby might fill its belly with\r\nit and feel none the worse. So sitting on the door-steps, the lady and\r\nthe dog with us, we remained yet a long time, the farmer talking first\r\nof sporting matters, and then getting into the everlasting topics of\r\nFree Trade, and exorbitant rents, taxes, and tithes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nWALK WITH A RUSTIC.—FAMILY MEETING.—A RECOLLECTION OF THE\r\nRHINE.—IGNORANCE AND DEGRADED CONDITION OF THE ENGLISH AGRICULTURAL\r\nLABOURER.—HOW HE IS REGARDED BY HIS SUPERIORS.—THE PRINCIPLES OF\r\nGOVERNMENT.—DUTIES OF THE GOVERNING.—EDUCATION.—SLAVERY.—THE DIET OF\r\nLABOURERS.—DRINK.—BREAD.—BACON.—FRESH MEAT.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE BACK PARISH._]\r\n\r\nWe were bound for Monmouth that night, and soon after sunset, having\r\none of the farm labourers for a guide, we struck across the fields\r\ninto another lane. About a mile from the farm-house, there was a short\r\nturn, and at the angle—the lane narrow and deep as usual—was a small,\r\nsteep-roofed, stone building, with a few square and arched windows\r\nhere and there in it, and a perfectly plain cube of stone for a tower,\r\nrising scarcely above the roof-tree, with an iron staff and vane on\r\none of its corners—“Saint some one’s parish church.” There was a small\r\ngraveyard, enclosed by a hedge around it; and in a corner of this,\r\nbut with three doors opening in its front upon the lane, was a long,\r\ncrooked, dilapidated old cottage. On one of the stone thresholds, a\r\ndirty, peevish-looking woman was lounging, and before her, lying on the\r\nground in the middle of the lane, were several boys and girls playing\r\nor quarrelling. They stopped as we came near, and rolling out of the\r\nway, stared silently, and without the least expression of recognition,\r\nat us, while we passed among them. As we went on, the woman said\r\nsomething in a sharp voice, and our guide shouted in reply, without,\r\nhowever, turning his head, “Stop thy maw—am going to Ameriky, aw tell\r\nthee.” It was his “missis,” he said.\r\n\r\n“Those were not your children that lay in the road?”\r\n\r\n“Yaaz they be—foive of ’em.”\r\n\r\nSo we fell into a talk with him about his condition and prospects; but\r\nbefore I describe it, let me relieve my page with a glimpse of rustic\r\ncharacter of another sort. It is one of the delightful memories of our\r\nlater ramble on the Rhine that writing of this incident recalls. A very\r\nsimple story, but illustrative in this connection of the difference\r\nwhich the traveller every where finds between the English and the\r\nGerman poor people.\r\n\r\nWe had been walking for some miles, late in a dusky evening, upon\r\na hilly road in the Rhine land, with an old peasant woman, who was\r\nreturning from market, carrying a heavy basket upon her head and two\r\nothers in her hands. She had declined to let us assist her in carrying\r\nthem, and though she had walked seven miles in the morning and now\r\nnearly that again at night, she had overtaken us, and was going on at\r\na pace, that for any great distance we should have found severe. (Of\r\ncourse, ladies, she wore the Bloomer skirt.) At a turn of the road we\r\nsaw the figure of a person standing still upon a little rising ground\r\nbefore us, indistinct in the dusk, but soon evidently a young woman.\r\nIt is my child, said the woman, hastily setting down her baskets and\r\nrunning forward, so that they met and embraced each other half way\r\nup the hill. The young woman then came down to us, and, taking the\r\ngreat basket on _her_ head, the two trudged on with rapid and animated\r\nconversation, in kind tones asking and telling of their experiences of\r\nthe day, entirely absorbed with each other, and apparently forgetting\r\nthat we were with them, until, a mile or two further on, we came near\r\nthe village in which they lived.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BREAD AND TOBACCO._]\r\n\r\nOur guide was a man of about forty, having a wife and seven children;\r\nneither he nor any of his family (he thought) could read or write,\r\nand, except with regard to his occupation as agricultural labourer,\r\nI scarcely ever saw a man of so limited information. He could tell\r\nus, for instance, almost no more about the church which adjoined his\r\nresidence than if he had never seen it—not half so much as we could\r\ndiscover for ourselves by a single glance at it. He had nothing to say\r\nabout the clergyman that officiated in it, and could tell us nothing\r\nabout the parish, except its name, and that it allowed him and five\r\nother labourers to occupy the “almshouse” we had seen, rent free. He\r\ncouldn’t say how old he was, (he appeared about forty,) but he could\r\nsay, “like a book,” that God was what made the world, and that “Jesus\r\nChrist came into the world to save sinners, of whom he was chief”—of\r\nthe truth of which latter clause I much doubted, suspecting the arch\r\nfiend would rank higher among his servants, the man whose idea of\r\nduty and impulse of love had been satisfied with cramming this poor\r\nsoul with such shells of spiritual nourishment. He thought two of his\r\nchildren knew the catechism and the creed; did not think they could\r\nhave learned it from a book; they might, but he never heard them read;\r\nwhen he came home and had gotten his supper, he had a smoke and then\r\nwent to bed. His wages were seven shillings, sometimes had been eight,\r\na-week. None of his children earned any thing; his wife, it might be,\r\ndid somewhat in harvest-time. But take the year through, _one dollar\r\nand sixty-eight_ cents a-week was all they earned to support themselves\r\nand their large family. How could they live? “Why, indeed, it was\r\nrather hard,” he said; “so hard, that sometimes, if we’d believe him,\r\nit had been as much as he could do to keep himself in tobacco!” It\r\nis an actual fact, that he mentioned this as if it was a vastly more\r\nmemorable hardship than that ofttimes he could get nothing more than\r\ndry bread for his family to eat. It was a common thing that they had\r\nnothing to eat but dry bread. He got the flour—_fine, white wheaten\r\nflour_—from the master. They kept a hog, and had so much bacon as it\r\nwould make to provide them with meat for the year. They also had a\r\nlittle potato patch, and he got cheese sometimes from the master. He\r\nhad tea, too, to his supper. The parish gave him his rent and he never\r\nwas called upon for tithes, taxes, or any such thing. In addition to\r\nhis wages, the master gave him, as he did all the labourers, three\r\nquarts either of cider or beer a-day, sometimes one and sometimes the\r\nother. He liked cider best—thought there was “more strength to it.”\r\nHarvest-time they got six quarts, and sometimes, when the work was very\r\nhard, he had had _ten quarts_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE PEASANTRY._]\r\n\r\nHe had heard of America and Australia as countries that poor folks\r\nwent to—he did not well know why, but supposed wages were higher, and\r\nthey could live cheaper. His master and other gentlemen had told him\r\nabout those places, and the labouring people talked about them among\r\nthemselves. They had talked to him about going there. (America and\r\nAustralia were all one—two names for the same place, for all that he\r\nknew.) He thought his master or _the parish_ would provide him the\r\nmeans of going, if he wanted them to. We advised him to emigrate then,\r\nby all means, not so much for himself as for his children—the idea of\r\nhis bringing seven, or it might yet be a dozen, more beings into the\r\nworld to live such dumb-beast lives, was horrible to us. I told him\r\nthat in America his children could go to school, and learn to read and\r\nwrite and to enjoy the revelation of God; and as they grew up they\r\nwould improve their position, and might be land-owners and farmers\r\nthemselves, as well off as his master; and he would have nothing to\r\npay, or at most but a trifle that he could gratefully spare, to have\r\nthem as well educated as the master’s son was being here; that where I\r\ncame from the farmers would be glad to give a man like him, who could\r\n“plough and sow and reap and mow as well as any other in the parish,”\r\neighteen shillings a-week—\r\n\r\n“And how much beer?”\r\n\r\n“None at all!”\r\n\r\n“None at all? ha, ha! _he’d_ not go then—you’d not catch him workin\r\nwithouten his drink. No, no! a man ’ould die off soon that gait.”\r\n\r\nIt was in vain that we offered fresh meat as an offset to the beer.\r\nThere was “strength,” he admitted, in beef, but it was wholly\r\nincredible that a man could _work on it_. A workingman must have\r\n_zider_ or beer—there was no use to argue against that. That “Jesus\r\nChrist came into the world to save sinners,” and that “work without\r\nbeer is death,” was the alpha and omega of his faith.\r\n\r\nThe labourers in this part of England (Hereford, Monmouth, Gloucester,\r\nand Wiltshire) were the most degraded, poor, stupid, brutal, and\r\nlicentious, that we saw in the kingdom. We were told that they were of\r\nthe purest Saxon blood, as was indeed indicated by the frequency of\r\nblue eyes and light hair among them. But I did not see in Ireland or in\r\nGermany or in France, nor did I ever see among our negroes or Indians,\r\nor among the Chinese or Malays, men whose tastes were such mere\r\ninstincts, or whose purpose of life and whose mode of life was so low,\r\nso like that of _domestic animals_ altogether, as these farm labourers.\r\n\r\nI was greatly pained, mortified, ashamed of old mother England, in\r\nacknowledging this; and the more so that I found so few Englishmen that\r\nrealized it, or who, realizing it, seemed to feel that any one but God,\r\nwith His laws of population and trade, was at all accountable for it.\r\nEven a most intelligent and distinguished Radical, when I alluded to\r\nthis element as a part of the _character_ of the country, in replying\r\nto certain very favourable comparisons he had been making of England\r\nwith other countries, said—“We are not used to regard that class in\r\nforming a judgment of national character.” And yet I suppose that class\r\nis larger in numbers than any other in the community of England. Many\r\nhave even dared to think that, in the mysterious decrees of Providence,\r\nthis balance of degradation and supine misery is essential to the\r\ncontinuance of the greatness, prosperity, and elevated character of the\r\ncountry—as if it were not indeed a part of the country.\r\n\r\nA minister of the Gospel, of high repute in London, and whose sermons\r\nare reprinted and often _repeated_ in America, from the words of\r\nChrist, “the poor ye have always among you,” argued lately that all\r\nlegislation or co-operative benevolence that had the tendency and hope\r\nof bringing about such a state of things that a large part of every\r\nnation should be independent of the _charity_ of the other part, was\r\nheretical and blasphemous. Closely allied to such ideas are the too\r\ncommon notions of _rulers_ and _subjects_.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _GOVERNMENT._]\r\n\r\nIn America we hold that a slave, a savage, a child, a maniac, and a\r\ncondemned criminal, are each and all _born_, equally with us, with\r\nour President, or with the Queen of England, free and self-governing;\r\nthat they have the same natural rights with us; but that attached to\r\nthose natural rights were certain duties, and when we find them, from\r\nwhatever cause,—no matter whether the original cause be with them, or\r\nour fathers, or us,—unable to perform those duties, we dispossess them\r\nof their rights: we restrain, we confine, we master, and we _govern_\r\nthem. But in taking upon ourselves to govern them, we take duties\r\nupon ourselves, and our first duty is that which is the first duty of\r\nevery man for himself—improvement, restoration, _regeneration_. By\r\nevery consideration of justice, by every noble instinct, we are bound\r\nto make it our highest and chiefest object to restore them, not the\r\nliberty first, but—the capacity for the liberty—for exercising the\r\nduties of the liberty—which is their natural right. And so much of the\r\nliberty as they are able to use to their own as well as our advantage,\r\nwe are bound constantly to allow them,—nay, more than they show\r\nabsolute evidence of their ability to use to advantage. We must not\r\nwait till a child can walk alone before we put it on its legs; we must\r\nnot wait till it can swim before we let it go in the water. As faith\r\nis necessary to self-improvement, _trust_ is necessary to education or\r\nrestoration of another: as necessary with the slave, the savage, the\r\nmaniac, the criminal, and the peasant—as necessary, and equally with\r\nall necessary—as with the child.\r\n\r\nIs not this our American doctrine in its only consistent extension?\r\nWe _govern_ in trust only for another, and a part of our trust is the\r\nrestoration of the _right_-ful owner by helping him towards that sound\r\nand well-informed mind and intelligent judgment that makes him truly\r\nfree and independent.\r\n\r\nThis is the only _government_ that we of the free United States\r\nof America, whether as fathers or children, statesmen or jurymen,\r\nrepresentatives or rabble, either claim or acknowledge. And it is of\r\nthis that all true Americans believe, “that is the best government that\r\ngoverns the least.” Using government in its properly restricted sense,\r\nas the authority and forcible direction of one over another, we hold\r\nthis to be as self-evident as that the life of free love is better than\r\nthe life of constrained legality, that the sentiment of mutual trust\r\nis nobler than that of suspicion or of fear, that the new dispensation\r\nof Christ is higher than the old one of Moses. What else there is than\r\nthis care over the weak and diseased in the public administration\r\nof our affairs, is no more than associated labour—the employment of\r\ncertain common servants for the care of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\nEducation, then, with certain systematic exercise or discipline of the\r\ngoverned, having reference to and connected with a gradual elevation to\r\nequal freedom with the governing, we hold to be a very necessary part\r\nof all rightful government. Where it is not, we say this is no true and\r\nrightful government, but a despotism and a sin.\r\n\r\nBut we shall be at once asked: Is your fugitive law designed for such\r\npurposes? Do your slaveholders govern the simple-minded Africans whom\r\nthey keep in restraint on these principles?\r\n\r\n_So far as they do not, their claim is “heretical and blasphemous.”_\r\n\r\nLet us never hesitate to acknowledge it—any where and every where\r\nto acknowledge it—and before all people mourn over it. Let us, who\r\nneed not to bear the heavy burden and live in the dark cloud of this\r\nresponsibility, never, either in brotherly love, national vanity, or\r\nsubjection to insolence, fear to declare, that, in the misdirection of\r\npower by our slaveholders, they are false to the basis of our Union and\r\nblasphemous to the Father who, equally and with equal freedom, created\r\nall men. Would that they might see, too, that while they continue to\r\nmanifest before the world, in their legislation upon it, no other\r\nthan mean, sordid, short-sighted, and barbarian purposes, they must\r\ncomplain, threaten, expostulate, and compromise in vain. If we drive\r\nback the truth of God, we must expect ever-recurring, irrestrainable,\r\nirresistible _reaction_. The law of God in our hearts binds us in\r\nfidelity to the _principles_ of the Constitution. They are not to\r\nbe found in “Abolitionism,” nor are they to be found—oh! remember\r\nit, brothers, and forgive these few words—in _hopeless, dawnless,\r\nunredeeming_ slavery.\r\n\r\nAnd so we hold that party in England, which regard their labouring\r\nclass as a permanent providential _institution_, not to be improved in\r\nevery way, educated, fitted to take an equal share with all Englishmen\r\nin the government of the commonwealth of England, to be blasphemers,\r\ntyrants, and insolent rebels to humanity. (Many of them as good-souled\r\nmen as the world contains, nevertheless.)\r\n\r\nI have before said, and I repeat it with confidence, that I believe\r\nthis party to be the weaker one in England. I must believe that the\r\nlove of justice, freedom, and consistency, is stronger with Englishmen\r\nthan the bonds of custom, self-conceit, and blind idolatry of human\r\narrangement, under however sacred names it has come to them.\r\n\r\nBut our British friends will ask: Would it be practicable to give these\r\npoor toiling semi-brutes any—the smallest—exercise of that governmental\r\npower, which, so far as they be not wholly brutes, is their right?\r\nYes, we American farmers would judge, yes: there are offices to be\r\nperformed for the commonwealth of each parish or neighbourhood, of the\r\nrequirements of which they are, or soon would make themselves, fit\r\njudges. If there are not, then make such offices. Who is a kind, firm,\r\nand closely scrutinizing master; who is a judicious and successful\r\nfarmer; who is an honest dealer with them; who is a skilful ploughman,\r\na good thatcher, a good hedge-trimmer, in the mile or two about them,\r\nthey always have formed a judgment.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FOOD AND DRINK._]\r\n\r\nWith regard to the habits of drinking and the customary diet of\r\nthose by whose labour England is mainly supplied with food, I fear\r\nmy statements may be incredible to Americans; I therefore quote from\r\nauthority that should be better informed.\r\n\r\nA correspondent of the Agricultural Gazette mentions, that in\r\nHerefordshire and Worcestershire the allowance of cider given to\r\nlabourers, in addition to wages, is “one to _ten gallons_ a-day.” He\r\nobserves that, of course, men cannot work without some drink, but\r\nthat they often drink more than is probably of any advantage to them,\r\nand suggests that an allowance of money be given instead of cider, and\r\nthe labourers be made to buy their drink. In this way, he thinks, they\r\nwould not be likely to drink more than they needed, and it would be an\r\neconomical operation for both parties. In Normandy, the cider district\r\nof France, three gallons a-day is the usual allowance of labourers.\r\n\r\n  “The usual allowance given in Herefordshire by masters, is three\r\n  quarts a-day; and in harvest-time many labourers drink in a day ten\r\n  or twelve quarts of a liquor that in a stranger’s mouth would be\r\n  mistaken for vinegar.”—_Johnson and Errington on the Apple._\r\n\r\n  “Bacon, when they can get it, is the staff of the labourers’ dinner.”\r\n  “The frugal housewife provides a large lot of potatoes, and while she\r\n  indulges herself with her younger ones only with salt, cuts off the\r\n  small rasher and toasts it over the plates of the father and elder\r\n  sons, as being the _bread-winners_; and _this is all they want_.”—_“A\r\n  Rector and Conservative” in the Times._\r\n\r\n  “After doing up his horses he takes breakfast, which is made of\r\n  flour, with a little butter, and water “from the tea-kettle” poured\r\n  over it. He takes with him to the field a piece of bread and (if he\r\n  has not a young family and can afford it) cheese, to eat at midday.\r\n  He returns home in the afternoon to a few potatoes, and possibly a\r\n  little bacon, though only those who are better off can afford this.\r\n  The supper very often consists of bread and water.”—_“The Times\r\n  Commissioner,” in Wiltshire_, 1851.\r\n\r\nIt would be unjust not to add, that in a large part of England the\r\nlabourers are much more comfortable than these statements might\r\nindicate. I am also convinced that the condition of the labourer\r\ngenerally is _improving_, and that he is now in a much less famishing\r\ncondition than ten years ago. The main stay of the labourer’s stomach\r\nis fine, white wheaten bread, of the best possible quality, such as it\r\nwould be a luxury to get any where else in the world, and such as many\r\na New England farmer never tasted, and, even if his wife were able to\r\nmake it, would think an extravagance to be ordinarily upon his table.\r\nNo doubt a coarser bread would be more wholesome, but it is one of\r\nthe strongest prejudices of the English peasant, that brown bread is\r\nnot fit for human beings. In Scotland and Ireland, and in some hilly\r\ndistricts of England, only, wheat bread is displaced by more wholesome\r\nand economical preparations from oatmeal.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FRESH MEAT._]\r\n\r\nWith regard to fresh meat, a farmer once said to me, “They will\r\nhardly taste it all their lives, except, it may be, once a-year, at a\r\nfair, when they’ll go to the cook-shops and stuff themselves with all\r\nthey’ll hold of it; and if you could see them, you’d say they did not\r\nknow what it was or what was to be done with it—cutting it into great\r\nmouthfuls and gobbling it down without any chewing, like as a fowl does\r\nbarleycorns, till it chokes him.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTINTERN ABBEY AND THE WYE.—ENGLISH SCREW-STEAMERS.—TIDE\r\nDELUGE.—ST. VINCENT’S ROCKS.—BRISTOL-BUILT VESSELS.—THE\r\nVALE OF GLOUCESTER.—WHITFIELD “EXAMPLE FARM.”—HEDGE-ROW\r\nTIMBER.—DRAINAGE.—BUILDINGS.—STOCK.—SOILING.—MANURE.—WHEAT.—BEETS\r\nAND TURNIPS.—DISGRACEFUL AGRICULTURE.—THE LANDED GENTRY.—WAGES OF\r\nLABOURERS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                             _Chepstow._\r\n\r\nWe have had a fierce storm of wind and rain to-day, notwithstanding\r\nwhich we have _done_ (I am sorry to use the word) Tintern Abbey and the\r\ncelebrated scenery of the Wye.\r\n\r\nThe first every body has heard of, and many have dined off it; for it\r\nis the subject of a common crockery picture. It is “a grand exhibition\r\nof Gothic ruins, admittance twenty-five cents; children, half-price.”\r\nIt is indeed exceedingly beautiful and interesting, and would be most\r\ndelightful to visit, if one could stumble into it alone and contemplate\r\nit in silence; but to have a vulgar, sycophantic, parrot-chattering\r\nshowman locking himself in with you, fastening himself to your elbow,\r\nholding an umbrella over you, and insisting upon exactly when, where,\r\nwhat, and how much you shall admire, there was more poetry on the\r\ndinner-plate.\r\n\r\nThe scenery of the Wye has, at some points, much grandeur. They say\r\nthere is nothing else like it in England. There is a great deal, with\r\nthe same character, however, in America; and as we were familiar with\r\nscenes of even much greater sublimity, we found that we had been led\r\nto expect too much, and were rather disappointed with it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _BRISTOL BUILT._]\r\n\r\nWe took passage from Chepstow to Bristol in a small iron screw-steamer.\r\nShe was sharp and neatly modelled, and made very good speed—about\r\nfifteen knots. The captain said he could show his stern to any\r\nside-wheel steamer of her size in England. Near the junction of the\r\nWye and the Severn there is a good breadth of water, and we found here\r\na heavy swell and a reefing breeze. The little boat, with a small\r\ngaff-sail forward, “just to steady her,” threw it off one side and the\r\nother, and made her way along very handsomely and comfortably. It is\r\nmy impression, that the English have got a good deal ahead of us with\r\nscrew-craft.\r\n\r\nThe tide-current in these rivers is a furious deluge. The rise and fall\r\nat Chepstow is FIFTY-THREE FEET! (_Daniels’ Shipmaster’s Directory._)\r\nAt Bristol, I think it is even greater than this. The striking effects\r\nupon the banks, and the difficulty of navigation, may be imagined.\r\nHence it is that Bristol ships have always been noted for strength, and\r\nso arose the term “_Bristol-built_,” to describe any structure well put\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nSt. Vincent’s rocks, of which I had often heard sailors speak—immense\r\nbanks of solid rock, that, for some miles below Bristol, the narrow,\r\ncanal-like river flows between—are indeed amazingly grand. It was most\r\nimpressive and belittling to one’s earthy self to meet between them a\r\nmerchant ship of the largest class—the tiny boy that we looked upright\r\nto see upon her royal yard not high enough by some hundred feet to look\r\nover them. And yet so perpendicular are they, and so narrow is the\r\nstream, that they are preparing to throw an arch over between them.\r\n\r\nPassing with too little delay through the interesting towns of Clifton\r\nand Bristol, I parted with my friends, and went on the same day into\r\nthe agricultural district known as the Vale of Gloucester.\r\n\r\nThe general aspect of this district is exceedingly beautiful;\r\nundulating, like Herefordshire, with more commonly extensive flat\r\nsurfaces, very large hedges, and much timber; very thickly peopled, the\r\ncottages and farm buildings old and picturesque, and the fields well\r\nstocked with cattle.\r\n\r\nThe agriculture of the district is similar to that of Cheshire, except\r\nthat it is in general much behind it, neither draining nor boneing\r\nhaving been common improvements. The people I fell in with were usually\r\nlacking equally in courtesy and intelligence, and I learned nothing\r\nof value agriculturally, until I reached, at near nightfall, a farm\r\nconducted agreeably to the wishes of one of the landlords of the Vale,\r\nespecially with the intention of giving his tenants an example of a\r\nbetter system of farming than they were accustomed to be content with.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “_THE EXAMPLE FARM._”]\r\n\r\nFor this purpose, an ordinary farm of 260 acres, in the midst of the\r\nestate, was, about ten years ago, put into the hands of an excellent\r\nScotch agriculturist, Mr. Morton. His first movement was to remove\r\nthe superfluous fences and the enormous quantity of hedge-row timber\r\nthat the farm, like all others in the district, was encumbered with.\r\nIt gives us a great idea of the amount of this, as well of the value\r\nof timber in England, to learn that what was thus obtained merely from\r\nthe fences of 260 acres was sold for over $17,000! There is now very\r\nlittle, if any, interior fencing upon the farm. The surface-water\r\nwas drawn into one channel, and the whole farm under-drained with\r\nthree-feet drains. Upon the steeper slopes the drains were laid with\r\nsmall stones, otherwise with tile. This was the only case in which I\r\nheard of stones being used by any good farmer of late years in England\r\nfor drains. Even where stone is in the way upon the surface, it is\r\nfound more economical to employ tile or pipes. After thorough drainage,\r\nevery acre of the farm was subsoiled, and gradually the whole was\r\nlimed, at the rate of one hundred and twenty bushels an acre, and\r\ndivided into ten-acre lots, without fences.\r\n\r\nNot the least unpractical labour or expense for show has been made.\r\nThe walls, gates, farm-house, stables, and outbuildings, are all of\r\nsimple, and even rude construction. As far as I could judge, every\r\narrangement and every practice upon the farm was such as would commend\r\nitself to any farmer, and might be easily followed by any one who\r\ncould command the capital which a similar extent of soil would seem\r\nto need for its profitable cultivation. Almost every inch of the\r\nsurface outside the buildings and the lane is tilled, there being no\r\npasture. In the stables we found a stock of mongrel cows, mostly of\r\nHereford and Short-horn blood, bought to be fattened. No stock is\r\nraised. Each cow was in a separate loose box. They are fed at this\r\nseason with clover and trefoil, and supplied with a great profusion of\r\nstraw litter. The manure is allowed to accumulate under them until it\r\nbecomes inconvenient. The cows appeared to be in healthy and thriving\r\ncondition; they were generally lying down and quietly ruminating with\r\nan aspect of entire satisfaction. The horse-stalls were of the form\r\nand size most common in our cities; the horses rather lighter than\r\nthe ordinary English draught-horses. A steam-engine is employed for\r\nthreshing, cutting turnips, &c. All the crops but wheat, I believe, are\r\nfed upon the farm, and all the straw is used as litter; of course an\r\nimmense stock of manure is manufactured, and little or none needs to be\r\nbought to sustain a high fertility and large crops of every kind.\r\n\r\nUnder this system, Mr. Morton is able to grow wheat every second year;\r\nso that one-half the farm was covered with magnificent crops of this\r\ngrain, likely to yield full forty bushels an acre, which would be worth\r\nat least $6000. The wheat is all drilled, and looked to me particularly\r\nclean and even. The alternate crops are carrots, mangel-wurzel,\r\nruta-baga, potatoes, and clover. Of the latter, forty acres; of the\r\nroots, mangel-wurzel occupied the largest space. Mr. Morton told me\r\nthat he had, of late, much preferred it to turnips; thought he could\r\nget thirty tons from an acre that would only yield twenty of ruta-baga,\r\nwith similar expense. A few acres were devoted to vegetables and fruit\r\nfor the family, and to the raising of seeds for the root-crops. I\r\ndo not recollect to have seen a weed on the farm, except among the\r\npotatoes, which were being hoed by labourers, with very large hoes made\r\nfor the purpose.\r\n\r\nOf course the expense of such improvement as I have described was very\r\ngreat; but the proprietor considers it to have been a good investment.\r\nIt is now leased by Mr. Morton and his son.\r\n\r\nIt is called the “Example Farm;” how appropriately, may be judged by\r\nthe following description of an ordinary farm of the neighbourhood, by\r\nthe “Times’ Commissioner:”\r\n\r\n  “An inconvenient road conducted us to the entrance-gate of a\r\n  dilapidated farm-yard, one side of which was occupied by a huge\r\n  barn and wagon-shed, and the other by the farm-house, dairy, and\r\n  piggeries. The farm-yard was divided by a wall, and two lots of\r\n  milch-cows were accommodated in the separate divisions. On one side\r\n  was a temporary shed, covered with bushes and straw. Beneath this\r\n  shed there was a comparatively dry lair for the stock; the yard\r\n  itself was wet, dirty, and uncomfortable. The other yard was exactly\r\n  the counterpart of this, except that it wanted even the shelter-shed.\r\n  In these two yards are confined the dairy-stock of the farm during\r\n  the winter months; they are supplied with hay in antique, square\r\n  hay-racks, ingeniously capped over, to protect the hay, with a\r\n  thatched roof, very much resembling the pictures of Robinson Crusoe’s\r\n  hut. In each yard two of them are placed, round which the shivering\r\n  animals station themselves as soon as the feeder gives them their\r\n  diurnal ration, and then patiently ruminate the scanty contents. A\r\n  dripping rain fell as we looked at them, from which their heads\r\n  were sheltered by the thatched roof of the hay-rack, only to have\r\n  it poured in a heavier stream on their necks and shoulders. In the\r\n  other yard the cows had finished their provender, and showed their\r\n  dissatisfaction with its meagre character by butting each other round\r\n  the rack. The largest and greediest having finished her own share,\r\n  immediately dislodges her neighbour, while she, in her turn, repeats\r\n  the blow upon the next, and so the chase begins, the cows digging\r\n  their horns into each other’s sides, and discontentedly pursuing one\r\n  another through the wet and miry yard. Leaving the yard we passed\r\n  into the fields, sinking at every step in the sour, wet grass-lands.\r\n  Here, little heaps of dung, the exhausted relics of the hay, from\r\n  which the cows derive their only support in winter, were being\r\n  scattered thinly over the ground, to aid in the production of another\r\n  crop of hay.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _LANDLORDS._]\r\n\r\nI have shown how much good a wealthy landlord may find it his profit\r\nto do in the way of improving agriculture. Mr. Caird intimates that\r\nfor such a state of things as is exhibited in the last picture, we are\r\nalso to hold the landlord accountable. Mr. Caird likewise says, “On\r\nall hands the farmer suffers: he pays rent for space occupied by his\r\nlandlord’s trees; he provides harbour for his landlord’s game, which,\r\nin return, feed upon his crops; (it is for this reason many landlords\r\nwill not allow the fences to be touched;) if he attempts to plough out\r\ninferior pasture, his crop becomes an additional feeding-ground for the\r\ngame; whilst the small fields and crooked fences prevent all efforts at\r\neconomy of labour, and compel him either to restrict his cultivation,\r\nor execute it negligently and unprofitably.”\r\n\r\nGod keep us evermore free from a “powerful conservative landed gentry,”\r\na curse not unmixed with good though it be.\r\n\r\nWages of labourers were mentioned to me at 8_s._ Caird says 7_s._ and\r\n8_s._, and sometimes 6_s._; but it was added, significantly, that 6_s._\r\nworth of work is only given in such a case.\r\n\r\nI spent the night with the Messrs. Morton, and returned by rail to\r\nBristol the following morning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nBATH.—WARMINSTER.—SURLY POSTMASTER.—A DOUBTFUL CHARACTER.—POLITE\r\nINNKEEPER AND PRETTY CHAMBERMAID.—THE TAP-ROOM FIRESIDE.—RUSTIC\r\nCIVILITY.—RAINY MORNING IN A COUNTRY INN.—COMING TO MARKET.—THE ROAD\r\nIN A STORM.—SCUDDING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was raining hard when I again reached Bristol, and I at once jumped\r\non board a train ready to leave for Bath. Here I found that my friends\r\nhad walked on, and after looking at the “pump-room” and a grimy old\r\ncathedral, and getting a dinner, I determined to follow them. There was\r\nno public conveyance that evening, and I started on foot, thinking to\r\novertake them at Warminster.\r\n\r\nAt the top of a high hill I stopped under a tree during a temporary\r\ntorrent of rain, and looked back at what I could not help thinking\r\nwould be a grand view if there were but a gleam of sunshine upon it;\r\nbut perhaps it was grander by help of the imagination in the obscurity\r\nof the rain and drifting scud and murky cloud of smoke that was swept\r\nfragrant towards me from the city. Bath is situated among and up the\r\nsides of extensive hills, and the country about it is much of it\r\nwell wooded and studded with numerous villas. The town is remarkably\r\nwell built, with numerous stately terrace-houses, of the same fine,\r\nsoft-tinted sandstone (Bathstone) that I described at Liverpool. It is\r\na famous old watering-place, you know; “a mort of merry-making” there\r\nhas been in it in days past, but now, though by no means a decayed\r\ntown, I believe its glory in this respect has departed. I should\r\njudge it still to be a place of great wealth and elegance, but less\r\ndistinguished for gayety and folly than formerly. All I can say of the\r\ninhabitants really, from personal observation, is, that they “know\r\nenough to stay in when it rains,” for I hardly saw one in the streets,\r\nexcept the men who were waiting by the little covered “chairs,” such\r\nas Mrs. Skewton is represented by Cruikshanks to be wheeled about in\r\nby her miserable, lanky page. I saw hundreds of these, ranged in the\r\nstreets as hackney-coaches are in our towns, but no carriage of any\r\nkind, public or private; perhaps the association of Bath coachmen had\r\n“met to a cold swarry.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE WARMINSTER ROAD._]\r\n\r\nAfter a walk of two miles into the country, I found I had been\r\nmisdirected, and had a good deal of difficulty in finding the right\r\nroad. I once asked the way of two labourers, and their replies were\r\nin such language, and they were so stupid, that I could not get the\r\nleast idea of what they meant. My guess was, that they either could not\r\nunderstand what I wanted, or that they did not know themselves whether\r\nor not it was the Warminster road that they were at work upon. It was\r\nafter four o’clock when I at length got upon the straight road, with\r\nseventeen miles before me—a hilly road, with a thin, slimy chalk-mud\r\nunder foot. I stopped once again during another tremendous torrent,\r\ntaking the opportunity _to bait_ at a neat little inn, and reached\r\nWarminster, after a hard pull, at nine o’clock. The first building in\r\nthe town, as you come from Bath, is a fine old church, going round\r\nthe yard of which you enter abruptly upon a close-built street of old\r\nthatched two-story houses—so different from the gradually thickening\r\nand improving houses, as you approach the cluster of churches and\r\ncentre of a New England village.\r\n\r\nThe postmaster had no letters for me, and seemed to be very angry that\r\nI should have expected him to have. I looked from one inn to another,\r\nnot finding my friends, and finally, muddy, wet, and tired enough,\r\nstopped at what seemed the last in the street, a house of humble\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nI desired to be showed to my room. Master, mistress, maid, and Boots,\r\nimmediately surrounded and eyed me closely, and I could not but\r\nremember that I might, probably, bear a suspicious appearance to them.\r\nAs I take off my cape, maid—a nice, kind-looking, black-eyed little\r\ngirl—catches it up, and runs off to hang it by the kitchen fire (an\r\nabsurd operation, as it is made of oiled silk)—she is back in a moment\r\nwith a light, and, lifting my knapsack, shows me up to a pleasant\r\nroom, with a deep, dark-curtained bed—slides out, and again is back\r\nin a moment with slippers, and asks to take my shoes to be dried,\r\nand what would I wish for supper? I decline supper, and intend to go\r\nto bed at once. Down she goes, and, after a moment more, in pops the\r\nlandlord—“Was you understood aright, sir?—no supper, sir!—not coming\r\ndown, sir!—going to bed, sir!—_directly_, sir, without supper, sir!”\r\nand while saying this, he bustles about the room, and locks the closet\r\ndoors, puts the keys in his pocket, and then turns towards me with a\r\nsuspicious look at my knapsack. “Yes,” I answer, quietly; and, drawing\r\nout shirt, socks, and tooth-brush, “I find myself much heated, and\r\nwet with perspiration and the rain; I took supper upon the road, and\r\nI thought I had best get my clothes off, and at once to bed.” “Ah! I\r\nsee, sir; quite right, sir; ah! yes, sir; dry socks too, sir; yes, sir;\r\nindeed, sir, I was not aware; beg pardon, sir: but indeed, would you\r\nstep down stairs a moment, sir—fine fire in the tap, sir—dry yourself,\r\nif you would please, for a moment, I would have the room put in better\r\norder for you, sir; indeed, the bed is hardly—if you would, sir—thank\r\nyou, sir.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _RUSTICS._]\r\n\r\nIn the tap-room were three fellows with smock frocks. As I approached,\r\none called to another, who was nearer the fire, to give me his\r\nseat, and offered me, with truly rustic grace and politeness, his\r\nhalf-emptied pot of beer. I have a strong stomach, and dislike to\r\nrepulse what is meant for kindness; so I tasted it, and tried to enter\r\ninto conversation with them. I soon found it was impossible; for I\r\ncould make nothing of two-thirds of their replies, and I doubted if\r\nthey could understand me much better. So I contented myself with\r\nlistening, while they continued to talk or mumble with each other. The\r\nsubjects of their conversation were beer and “the girls:” of the latter\r\ntopic they said nothing to be repeated; of the former, they wished the\r\nfarmers never gave worse drink than that they were now enjoying—“it was\r\nmost good for nothing, some of it, what they gave out.” And one told\r\nhow he had had to drink so much of it once, it had made him clear sick;\r\nand then another told how, on the other hand, he had made himself sick\r\none day, when somebody wouldn’t give him as much beer as he wanted, by\r\ntaking a draught of cold water.\r\n\r\nWhen the little maid came in to say that my bed was now “quite ready,”\r\nand I rose to withdraw from the circle, they all gave a singular jerk\r\nforward of their heads and touched their foreheads with their right\r\nhand, as a parting salutation.\r\n\r\n“Would you let me take something else down to be dried now, sir, your\r\ncoat, sir, or any thing—the socks, sir; thank you, sir. Hope you’ll\r\nsleep well, sir.”\r\n\r\nI didn’t do any thing else till, when I stopped, I found it nine\r\no’clock the next morning. There was a steady roar upon the tiles—the\r\nrain still continued—I drew the window-curtain, and there was Geoffrey\r\nCrayon’s picture almost to the life: a sleepy old gray mare “_letting_\r\nit rain;” a draggle-tailed cock on a smoking dunghill eyeing with the\r\nair of a miserable sick saint the riotous orgies of a company of mad\r\nducks deep in their favourite liquor; half-a-dozen doves huddled moping\r\ntogether on the thatch of the stable—a sombre tone over every thing,\r\nand rain, rain, rain.\r\n\r\n“Hope you rested well, sir,” said the landlord as I reached the foot of\r\nthe crooked stairs; “a dirty day, sir. Have your shoes, sir? What’ll\r\nyou please to have for breakfast, sir? Steak, sir! O yes, sir—or chop,\r\nsir; give you very nice chop, sir; yes, sir, thank you, sir. Walk in\r\nhere, sir? Ready shortly, sir.”\r\n\r\nTo get to the breakfast I was led through the kitchen, a large room\r\nwith saddles and box-coats and whips and straps hung up with the bacon\r\non the ceiling and walls. The breakfast-room (dining-room) was also\r\nmuch larger than any room you would have supposed from the front of\r\nthe house it was likely to contain. Its plan was octagonal, with a\r\nsingle great red-curtained bow-window, and stately, high-backed chairs,\r\nsuggesting a corporation banquet.\r\n\r\nIt is a rainy day in a country inn, dull enough; nothing to do but\r\nwrite, and for writing I am not inclined. I determine to take the\r\nroad again and overtake J. and C., who will perhaps be waiting for me\r\nsomewhere on the way to Salisbury.\r\n\r\n“Going on, sir—yes, sir.” All my things are brought, dry and warm, and\r\nnicely folded; and now I have curiosity to know what value is placed\r\nupon so much suavity and care for my comfort. The landlord meets my\r\nrequest with deprecating gesture and grimace, as if it was a pity that\r\nthe custom of society made such a form necessary between a host and\r\nhis guest—as if he were about to say—“I am grieved that you should\r\nmention it; really it is I that am indebted to you for this honour—but\r\nif you insist, why”—ending the _aside_, but still low, hurried, and\r\nindistinct—“sixpence for bed and a shilling for breakfast, and—(shall I\r\nsay thre’pence?) for Boots, sir.” “Yes, and the rest of this to that\r\nexcellent little chambermaid, if you please.” “Oh, _my little girl_,\r\nsir; oh, thank ye, sir, you are very good, sir—yes, sir, you can’t miss\r\nit, sir, straight road after you pass the gate, sir. _Good_-morning,\r\nsir; should be glad to see you if you are this way again, sir, or any\r\nof your friends. _Good_-morning, sir. Hope you’ll have a fine day yet,\r\nsir! It’s slacking up e’en now, I think. Indeed it is, sir! Ah, you’ll\r\nhave a fine day for a walk, sir. _Good_-morning, sir.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE ROAD IN A STORM._]\r\n\r\nIf it slackens at all, it is only for a moment, and then the rain is\r\npoured down again densely and with renewed vehemence; and the wind,\r\ncoming from behind, fairly twists one about, and hurries one along in\r\nits strong, fitful gusts. It is market-day in Warminster, and, as I go\r\nout, every body else and every thing else seems to be coming in. Men,\r\nwomen, and children, in all sorts of English vehicles—spring-carts,\r\ntaxed-carts, great broad-wheeled carts, or long wagons, with bodies\r\nof a curious curved form flaring out over the wheels, canvas tops,\r\nstretched over all, upon hoops; sometimes two horses abreast, drawing\r\nthem in a double set of shafts; oftener two or three, and frequently\r\nfour, five, or six, all in a line, (tandem,) great, intelligent beasts,\r\nkeeping well to the left, where none will interfere with them, and they\r\ncan legally harm no one. (“Keep the _left_,” is the rule of the road\r\nin England; not the right, as with us.) They are driven without reins;\r\nand more than once this morning I saw the driver, well dosed with beer,\r\nI suppose, and fatigued with night-work, fast asleep on the top of his\r\nload. Once I saw a gentleman, who had nearly run against one of these\r\nsleeping fellows, strike him smartly with his whip as he passed—“You\r\nhad best wake up, sir; who’s your master?” “Mr. ——, of ——, sir,”\r\nanswered the man, rubbing himself. “Very well, I shall let him know\r\nwhat sort of a carter he has.” A Yankee driver, so waked up, would have\r\nreplied to the whip first.\r\n\r\nGentlemen come up at a spanking pace, with tall, lithe, worried-looking\r\nhorses, in dog-carts, or in the saddle, screwing their heads as deep as\r\nthey can into their drab coats, bending low, and their hats pulled down\r\ntight upon their brows, never hardly with an umbrella, but with a groom\r\nwith gold hat-band by their side sometimes. They look scowlingly, as\r\nthey approach, at me; with my hat-brim turned up before and down behind\r\nto shed the water from my face, my water-proof cape tightly fastened\r\nat my waist behind, and swelling and fluttering before, my arms folded\r\nunder it, I return their inquiring stare complacently; and some, as\r\nthey come up, draw their lips resolutely tighter, and give me about\r\nquarter of a nod, as if they understood and approved my arrangement.\r\n\r\nMen on foot, and women, too, with clogs and pattens and old green and\r\nblue umbrellas, and bundles and bags and baskets and hampers, and cages\r\nand parcels in handkerchiefs; old and young, lasses and lads, generally\r\nthree or four couples together, coming to town for a holiday, loudly\r\nlaughing and coarsely joking; bound to enjoy themselves spite of the\r\nshameful indelicacy of the wind, and the chill drenching of the rain,\r\nand the most misplaced attachment to their finery of the spattering mud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOUTH DOWNS.—WILTSHIRE LANDSCAPE.—CHALK AND\r\nFLINT.—IRRIGATION.—THE COST AND PROFIT OF WATER-MEADOWS.—SEWERAGE\r\nWATER.—IRRIGATION IN OLD TIMES.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _WILTSHIRE LANDSCAPE._]\r\n\r\nSoon after leaving Warminster, began a very different style of\r\nlandscape from what I have before seen: long ranges and large groups\r\nof high hills with gentle and gracefully undulating slopes; broad and\r\ndeep dells between and within them, through which flow in tortuous\r\nchannels streamlets of exceedingly pure, sparkling water. These hills\r\nare bare of trees, except rarely a close body of them, covering a space\r\nof perhaps an acre, and evidently planted by man. Within the shelter\r\nof these you will sometimes see that there is a large farm-house with\r\na small range of stables. The valleys are cultivated, but the hills in\r\ngreater part are covered, without the slightest variety, except what\r\narises from the changing contour of the ground, with short, wiry grass,\r\nstanding thinly, but sufficiently close to give the appearance, at a\r\nlittle distance from the eye, of a smooth, velvetty, green surface.\r\nAmong the first of the hills I observed, at a high elevation, long\r\nangular ramparts and earth-works, all greened over. Within them and\r\nat the summit of the hill were several extensive tumuli, evidently\r\nartificial, (though I find nothing about it in the books,) and on the\r\ntop of one of these was a shepherd and dog and a large flock of sheep,\r\nclear and coldly distinct, and appearing of gigantic size against the\r\nleaden clouds behind. In the course of the day I met with many of\r\nthese flocks, and nearly all the hill-land seemed given up to them. I\r\nwas upon the border, in fact, of the great _South-down_ district, and,\r\nduring the next week, the greater part of the country through which we\r\nwere travelling, was of the same general character of landscape, though\r\nfrequently not as green, varied, and pleasing, as in these outskirts of\r\nit.\r\n\r\nGeologically, it is a chalk district, the whole earth, high and low,\r\nand to any depth that I saw it exposed, being more or less of a white\r\ncolour, generally gray, but sometimes white as snow. The only mineral\r\nis flint, which occurs in small boulders or pebbles, cased in a\r\nhardened crust of carbonate of lime mingled irregularly with the chalk,\r\nmore thickly on the hill-tops, and often gathered in beds. The road\r\nis made of these flint pebbles, broken fine, and their chalk-crust,\r\npowdered by the attrition of wheels, is worked up into a slippery paste\r\nduring such heavy rains as I was experiencing, and makes the walking\r\npeculiarly fatiguing. The soil upon the hills is very dry and thin. In\r\nthe valleys it is deeper and richer, being composed, in a considerable\r\npart, of the wash of the higher country, and the wheat and forage crops\r\nwere often very luxuriant. Advantage is sometimes taken of the streams\r\nto form water-meadows, and the effect of irrigation can often be seen\r\nat a considerable distance in the deeper green and greater density of\r\nthe grass upon them. These meadows are of great agricultural value, and\r\nI will give an account of the method of construction and management of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _WATER MEADOWS._]\r\n\r\nAn artificial channel is made, into which the water of a brook may\r\nbe turned at will. This is carried along for as great a distance as\r\npracticable, so as to skirt the upper sides of fields of a convenient\r\nsurface for irrigation. At suitable intervals there are gates and\r\nsmaller channels, and eventually a great number of minor ducts, through\r\nwhich the water is distributed. The fields are divided by low walls,\r\nso that the water can be retained upon them as long as is desired, and\r\nthen drawn off to a lower level. Commonly, a series of meadows, held\r\nby different farmers, are flooded from one source, and old custom or\r\nagreement fixes the date of commencing the irrigation and the period of\r\ntime at which the water shall be moved from one to another.\r\n\r\nThe main flooding is usually given in October, after the grass has\r\nbeen closely eaten off by neat stock. It is then allowed to remain\r\nresting or quietly flowing over the land for two or three weeks; or\r\nfor two weeks, and, after an interval of a day or two, for two weeks\r\nmore. This consolidates the grassy surface, and encourages the growth\r\nand new formation of roots. The grass springs and grows luxuriantly\r\nafter this, and, as soon as it is observed to flag, the water is let\r\nin again for two or three weeks; it may be twice during the winter.\r\nWhenever a scum is observed to form, indicating that decomposition is\r\ncommencing below, the water is immediately drawn. In warm weather this\r\nwill occur very soon, perhaps in a day or two. I believe the water is\r\nalso never allowed, if possible, to freeze upon the meadows. In the\r\nspring, by the middle of March, sometimes sheep and lambs are turned on\r\nto the grass. After being fed pretty closely, they are removed, and the\r\nmeadows left for a crop of hay. They are ready for mowing in less than\r\ntwo months, and are then, after a short interval, pastured again with\r\nhorned cattle and horses. Some meadows are never pastured, and yield\r\nthree heavy crops of hay. Mr. Pusey (a member of Parliament) declares,\r\nthat he keeps sheep upon his water-meadows, in Berkshire, at the rate\r\nof thirty-six an acre, well fed, and intimates his belief that the\r\nproduce of grass-land is doubled by irrigation. Grass and hay, however,\r\nfrom irrigated meadows, are of slightly less nourishing quality. It\r\nis generally said, that a single winter’s flooding will increase the\r\ngrowth of grass equal to a top-dressing of thirty (thirty bushel) loads\r\nof dung.\r\n\r\nWe may judge somewhat from these facts and opinions of practical men,\r\nwhether, in any given circumstances, we can afford to construct the\r\ndam, channels, gates, sluices, &c., by which we may use this method\r\nof fertilizing our meadows. There are millions of acres in the United\r\nStates that could be most readily made subject to the system. The\r\noutlay for permanent works might often be very inconsiderable, and\r\nthe labour of making use of them, after construction, would be almost\r\nnothing. The cost of conveying manure, and its distribution by carts\r\nand manual labour, is a very important item in the expenditure of most\r\nof our eastern farms; and, though this is felt much less here, where\r\nlabour is so much cheaper, we may obtain many economical hints with\r\nregard to it from British practice. Fields distant from the farmstead,\r\nand hill-lands not easily accessible, should nearly always be enriched\r\nby bone, guano, and other concentrated manures; of which a man may\r\ncarry more on his back than will be of equal value with many cart-loads\r\nof dung, or by some other means which will dispense with long and heavy\r\ntransportation. I have obtained increased crops, with a saving of some\r\nhundred dollars a-year of expenditure, in this way.\r\n\r\nDifferent streams vary in their value for irrigation. The _muddiest_\r\nstreams are the best, as they generally carry suspended a great deal of\r\nthe fertile matter of the land through which they have flowed; often,\r\ntoo, road-washings, and other valuable drainings, have been taken along\r\nwith them, and these are caused to be deposited upon the meadow. A\r\nperfectly transparent fluid will often, however, have most valuable\r\nsalts in solution; and I noticed that most of the Wiltshire streams\r\nwere peculiarly clear, reminding me of the White Mountain trout-brooks.\r\nIt is said that streams abounding in fish, and which have abundance of\r\naquatic plants and luxuriant vegetation upon their borders, are to be\r\nrelied upon as the most enriching in their deposit. Streams, into which\r\nthe sewerage of large towns is emptied, are often of the greatest value\r\nfor agricultural purposes. A stream thus enriched is turned to the most\r\nimportant account near Edinburgh: certain lands, which were formerly\r\nbarren wastes, being merely the clean, dry sands thrown up by the sea\r\nin former times, having been arranged so that they may be flowed by\r\nthis stream. The expense of the operation was great—about one hundred\r\ndollars an acre—and the annual cost of flooding is very much greater\r\nthan usual—four or five dollars an acre; but the crops of hay are so\r\nfrequent and enormous, (ten cuttings being made in a season,) that some\r\nparts of the meadow _rent_ for _one hundred dollars_ a-year for one\r\nacre, and none for less than seventy-five dollars!\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SEWERAGE MANURE._]\r\n\r\nIt is estimated by the distinguished agriculturist, Smith of Deanston,\r\nthat the sewerage-water of a town may be contracted for, to be\r\ndelivered, (sent by subterranean pipes and branches, so that it may be\r\ndistributed over any required surface,) eleven miles out of town, for\r\n_four cents a-ton_. Mr. Hawksley, a prudent engineer, offers to convey\r\nit five miles, and raise it two hundred feet, for _five cents a-ton_;\r\nthe expense of carting it to the same distance and elevation being\r\nestimated at about $1. Another estimate makes the expense of conveying\r\nand distributing manure, in the solid form, as compared with liquid, at\r\nfifteen dollars to seventy-five cents, for equal fertilizing values.\r\nProfessor Johnston estimates the fertilizing value, _per annum_, of the\r\nsewerage of a town of one thousand inhabitants, as equal to a quantity\r\nof guano which, at present American prices, would be worth $13,000.\r\nSmith of Deanston estimates the cost of manuring an acre by sewerage,\r\nconveyed in aqueducts and distributed by jet-pipes, at three dollars\r\nan acre, and that of fertilizing it to an equal degree, in the usual\r\nway, by farm-yard manure, at fifteen dollars. Considering that the\r\nexpense of conveyance and distribution of solid manure is much greater\r\nin America than in England, these figures will not be thought to be\r\nwithout personal interest to us.\r\n\r\nThe use of manure-drainings and the urine of the cattle of a farm, very\r\nmuch diluted with spring water, has been found to have such astonishing\r\nimmediate effects, when distributed over young herbage, that several\r\nEnglish agricultural pioneers are making extensive and costly permanent\r\narrangements for its distribution, from their stables, over large\r\nsurfaces. It is first collected in tanks, where it is retained until\r\nputrefied, and mixed with the water of irrigation. This is then driven\r\nby forcing-pumps into the pipes which convey it, so that it can be\r\ndistributed (in one case, over one hundred and seventy acres.) The\r\npipes are hard-burnt clay tubes, an inch thick, joined with cement,\r\ncosting here about twelve and a-half cents a-yard. The pipe is laid\r\nunder ground, and at convenient intervals there are heads coming to the\r\nsurface with stop-cocks, where a hose can be attached and the water\r\nfurther guided in any direction. For greater distances, a cart like\r\nthose used for sprinkling the dusty streets of our cities is used. It\r\nis conjectured by some that, eventually, all manure will be furnished\r\nto land in a state of solution.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _GARDEN IRRIGATION._]\r\n\r\nI believe irrigation is only used for the benefit of grass-lands in\r\nEngland; but it probably might be found of great advantage to some\r\nother valuable crops. I have seen large fields of roots, apparently\r\nof the character of turnips, irrigated in China, and it is well\r\nknown that rice is every where flooded in tropical countries. I\r\nsuspect that irrigation, and even that expensive form of it that I\r\nhave last described, might be profitably used, for certain plants,\r\nby our market-gardeners; I judge so of celery and asparagus; and it\r\nis well known that enormous strawberries, and unusually large and\r\nlong-continuing crops of them, have resulted from an inefficient and\r\nunsystematic kind of irrigation. A small experiment that I made with\r\nIndian corn resulted in a great growth of stalk and in small and\r\nunhealthy malformed grain.\r\n\r\nIrrigation is of the least advantage upon heavy clay soils, and of the\r\ngreatest upon light sandy loams with gravelly subsoils. It is very\r\ndesirable that the construction of the soil should be such that the\r\nwater may gradually and somewhat rapidly filter through it; and it is\r\nconsidered of great importance, when the water is drawn off, after\r\nthe flooding, (_drowning_ is the local term,) that it should be very\r\ncompletely removed, leaving no small pools upon the surface. Stagnating\r\nwater, either above or below the surface, is very poisonous to most\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nI may remind those who have a prejudice against new practices in\r\nagriculture, that irrigation was practised as long ago as the days\r\nof the patriarchs. In this part of England it has been in use since\r\nabout the beginning of the seventeenth century, at which time an\r\nagreeably-written book on the subject was published by one Rowland\r\nVaughan, Esq. The account of the way that he was first led to make\r\nsystematic trial of irrigation, and the manner in which he proceeded,\r\nis amusing and instructive:—\r\n\r\n  “In the month of March I happened to find a mole or wont’s nest\r\n  raised on the brim of a brook in my meade, like a great hillock;\r\n  and from it there issued a little streame of water, (drawn by the\r\n  working of the mole,) down a shelving ground, one pace broad, and\r\n  some twenty in length. The running of this little streame did at that\r\n  time wonderfully content me, seeing it pleasing greene, and that\r\n  other land on both sides was full of moss, and hide-bound for want of\r\n  water. This was the first cause I undertook the drowning of grounds.\r\n\r\n  “Now to proceed to the execution of my worke: being perswaded of the\r\n  excellency of the water, I examined how many foote fall the brooke\r\n  yielded from my mill to the uppermost part of my grounds, being\r\n  in length a measured mile. There laye of medow land thirty acres\r\n  overworn with age, and heavily laden with moss, cowslips, and much\r\n  other imperfect grass, betwixt my mill stream and the maine river,\r\n  which (with two shillings cost) my grandfather and his grandsire,\r\n  with the rest, might have drowned at their pleasures; but from the\r\n  beginning never any thing was done, that either tradition or record\r\n  could witness, or any other testimonie.\r\n\r\n  “Having viewed the convenientest place, which the uppermost part of\r\n  my ground would afforde for placing a commanding weare or sluce, I\r\n  espied divers water falls on my neighbours’ grounds, higher than mine\r\n  by seven or eight foote: which gave me great advantage of drowning\r\n  more ground, than I was of mine own power able to do.\r\n\r\n  “I acquainted them with my purpose; the one being a gentleman of\r\n  worth and good nature, gave me leave to plant the one end of my\r\n  weare on his side the river: the other, my tenant, being very aged\r\n  and simple, by no perswasion I could use, would yield his consent,\r\n  alleging it would marre his grounds, yea, sometimes his apple trees;\r\n  and men told him, water would raise the rush, and kill his cowslips,\r\n  which was the chiefest flower his daughters had to tricke the\r\n  May-pole withal.\r\n\r\n  “After I had wrought thus farre, I caused my servant, a joyner, to\r\n  make a levell to discover what quantity of ground I might obtaine\r\n  from the entry of the water; allowing his doubling course, compassing\r\n  hills to carry it plym or even, which fell out to be some three\r\n  hundred acres.\r\n\r\n  “After I had plymmed it upon a true levell, I betooke myself to\r\n  the favour of my tenants, friends, and neighbours, in running\r\n  my maine trench, which I call my trench-royal. I call it so,\r\n  because I have within the contents of my worke, counter-trenches,\r\n  defending-trenches, topping-trenches, winter and summer-trenches,\r\n  double and treble-trenches, a traversing-trench with a point, and an\r\n  everlasting trench, with other troublesome trenches, which in a map\r\n  I will more lively expresse. When the inhabitants of the country,\r\n  wherein I inhabit, (namely the Golden Valley,) saw I had begun some\r\n  part of my worke, they summoned a consultation against me and my man\r\n  John, the leveller, saying our wits were in our hands, not in our\r\n  heads; so we both, for three or four years lay levell to the whole\r\n  country’s censure for such engineers as their forefathers heard not\r\n  of, nor they well able to endure without merryments.\r\n\r\n  “In the running and casting of my trench-royal, though it were\r\n  levelled from the beginning to the end, upon the face of the ground,\r\n  yet in the bottom I did likewise levell it to avoyde error.\r\n\r\n  “For the breadth and depth, my proportion is ten foote broad, and\r\n  four foote deep; unless in the beginning, to fetch the water to my\r\n  drowning grounds, I ran it some half mile eight foote deep, and in\r\n  some places sixteen foote broad. All the rest of the course for two\r\n  miles and a-half in length, according to my former proportion. When\r\n  my worke began in the eye of the country to carry a shew of profit,\r\n  it pleased many out of their courtesie to give it commendations, and\r\n  applaud the invention.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _MAIDS AND MEADOWS._]\r\n\r\nThe author then makes a considerable digression, to account for a delay\r\nin his proceedings, which was occasioned by processes issued against\r\nhim from the courts of Star Chamber, Chancery, and Wardes, to compel\r\nhim to deliver his niece and ward into their custody.\r\n\r\n  “These courts,” he observes, “bred more white haires in my head in\r\n  one year than all my wet-shod water-works did in sixteen. So leaving\r\n  my wanton ward in London, in the custody of a precisian or puritan\r\n  taylor, who would not endure to heare one of his journeymen sweare by\r\n  the cross of his shears; so full was he of sanctity in deceipt. But\r\n  the first news I heard was, that he had married my Welch niece to his\r\n  English nephew; and at my return, I was driven to take his word, that\r\n  he was neither privy to the contract, nor the marriage.”\r\n\r\nMr. Vaughan next gives the following directions for carrying this plan\r\ninto effect:—\r\n\r\n  “Having prepared your drowning course, be very careful that all the\r\n  ground subject to the same, whether meadow, pasture, or arable, be\r\n  as plain as any garden-plotte, and without furrows. Then follows\r\n  your attendance in flood-times: see that you suffer not your flood\r\n  water by negligence to pass away into the brooke, river, and sea, but\r\n  by your sluice command it to your grounds, and continue it playing\r\n  thereon so long as it appears muddy. In the beginning of March clear\r\n  your ground of cold water, and keep it as dry as a child under the\r\n  hands of a dainty nurse; observing generally that sandy ground will\r\n  endure ten times more water than the clay. A day or two before you\r\n  mow, if sufficient showers have not qualified the drought of your\r\n  ground, let down your sluice into your trench-royal, that thereby\r\n  you may command so much water to serve your turn as you desire.\r\n  Suffer it to descend where you mean first to mow, and you shall find\r\n  this manner of drowning in the morning before you mow so profitable\r\n  and good, that commonly you gain ten or twelve days’ advantage in\r\n  growing. For drowning before mowing, a day, or even two or three, so\r\n  supplies the ground, that it doth most sweetly release the root of\r\n  every particular grasse, although the sun be never so extream hot.\r\n  This practice will often make good a second mowing, and in walking\r\n  over grounds, I will tread as on velvet, or a Turkey carpet.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLOCKS, DOGS, AND SHEPHERDS OF SALISBURY PLAIN.—VILLAGE\r\nALMSHOUSES.—OSTENTATION IN ALMS-GIVING.—A FORCED MARCH.—AT HOME IN\r\nSALISBURY.—THE STREET BROOKS.—THE CATHEDRAL.—ARCHITECTURAL REMARKS\r\nAND ADVICE.—VILLAGE CHURCHES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chalk-hills, or downs, (known also in local parlance as\r\n_beak-land_,) are unenclosed or divided, and rarely separated from the\r\ncultivated land by more than a low turf-wall, and often not at all.\r\nOnce, in the course of the morning, I came near a flock of about two\r\nhundred sheep, feeding close to the road, and stopped a few moments to\r\nlook at them. They were thorough-bred South-downs; the shepherd sat\r\nat a little distance, upon a knoll, and the dog was nearer the flock.\r\nGrowing close up to the edge of the road, opposite the sheep, was a\r\nheavy piece of wheat; one of them strayed over to it. The dog cocked\r\nhis ears and turned quickly several times towards his master, as if\r\nknowing there was business for him, and waiting for orders. But the\r\nshepherd was looking another way, and others of the flock, lifting\r\ntheir heads as I approached them, and seeing their comrade on the other\r\nside of the road, began to rush after him, as is the manner of sheep;\r\nand directly there were a dozen eagerly nipping the wheat, and more\r\nfollowing: the dog, sitting up very erect, and on the _qui vive_, still\r\nwaited for orders, till the shepherd, turning quickly, gave the signal\r\nin a monosyllable. Right over the heads of the flock, bounding from\r\nhead to head, sprang the dog, yelping sharply as he reached the road;\r\nthe truants returned, and the whole flock broke at once into a hard\r\nrun,—dog dashing first one side, then the other—closing them rapidly\r\nup, and keeping them in a dense mass, until, at another shout from the\r\nshepherd, who had not risen, all at once halted, and, turning heads\r\nout, went to feeding, soon closing around the dog, leaving only a space\r\nof a few feet vacant about him. The dogs used by most of the shepherds\r\nseem to be mongrels, generally low in the legs, with great heads, short\r\nnecks, and rather shaggy. One that was said to be very sagacious and\r\nwell-trained, and for which I was asked thirty dollars, appeared as if\r\na cross of a spaniel with a terrier. Generally, the dogs were valued at\r\nonly from two to five dollars.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ALMSHOUSES._]\r\n\r\nIt cleared about noon, and after the rain ceased the air was calm,\r\nhot, and steamy. I recollect but one village, two rows of ugly,\r\nglaring, red brick houses, relieved by a church rectory and two other\r\nbuildings, cool and pleasing, under shade of ivy; and a large, old\r\nestablishment, with cupola and clock, and a square, green, shady court\r\nin front of it—devoted, as appeared by an inscription on its front,\r\nby somebody’s bequest, two hundred years ago, to the maintenance,\r\nin comfort, of a certain number of aged widowers and bachelors of\r\nthe parish. Such retreats for various denominations of the poor and\r\nunfortunate, called almshouses and hospitals, (vulgarly, “’spittals,”)\r\nare to be seen in almost every town in England. They are of all degrees\r\nof comfort—some stately and luxurious—others, and these quite common,\r\nmere cottages—hovels sometimes,—generally very old, and nearly always\r\nof ancient foundation. With more or less ostentation, the name of the\r\nfounder is displayed on the front,—sometimes with his bust, statue,\r\narms, or a ridiculous allegorical sculpture. This plan for sending\r\na dying sinner’s name down to future generations, with the grateful\r\nembalmment of charity, seems latterly out of fashion. What improved\r\ntype of character does it indicate, that the rich oftener prefer now\r\nto make their tribute to public opinion, by having their gift-money\r\nused while they yet live, and the amount of it paraded with their\r\nnames in the newspapers. Their “left hands,” probably, do not read the\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\nI was disappointed in not finding my friends at this village, but soon\r\nafter leaving it met two Germans travelling on foot, who said they had\r\nmet, at three hours back, two gentlemen who wore hats and, knapsacks\r\nlike mine. I feared that, not hearing from me at Salisbury, they would\r\nconclude I had gone on by Cirencester, to spend Sunday on the Isle of\r\nWight, and would go by the five-o’clock train to overtake me. It was\r\ntherefore necessary that I should hasten in to arrest them. I yet made\r\ntwo or three stoppages, once to converse with a shepherd, and once\r\nto sketch the outlines of a group of cottages, intending to take the\r\ncoach, which I was told would be passing in a few minutes. But when\r\ncoming up a hill, I _rose_ the fine spire of the cathedral, and found\r\nthat it was three miles distant, and the coach still not in sight, I\r\nstrapped tight my knapsack and went the rest of the way at “double\r\nquick.” Teamsters stopped their wagons as I met them, children at the\r\ncottage-doors called their mothers to help look at me, and at the\r\noffice of the “Wilts Game Law Reporter,” as I entered the town, taking\r\nthe middle of the street, a fat old gentleman in top-boots eagerly took\r\nout his watch and timed me, evidently supposing it was some interesting\r\naffair on a wager. Finding the post-office, but not finding any note\r\nfor me, I hastened on still to the station, which was well out of\r\nthe town on the other side, and which I reached at the same moment\r\nwith the delaying stage-coach. The train started a moment after. The\r\npoliceman in attendance was certain that no persons such as I described\r\nhad entered the station-house, and I returned to the town, and going\r\nfirst to the cathedral, there found J. and C. lying under the trees in\r\ndelighted contemplation of its beauty.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE TRAVELLERS’ HOME._]\r\n\r\nWe spent Sunday at Salisbury. We were fortunate in finding a\r\ncomfortable, quiet, old inn, in which we were the only lodgers. After\r\nonce getting acquainted with the crooked, elaborate stairways and\r\npassages, and learning the relative position of our chambers and the\r\ncommon rooms, we were as much at home, as quiet, and as able to command\r\nwhatever we had occasion for, as if we had leased the house, furnished,\r\nand manned it. The landlady was our housekeeper, the servants our\r\ndomestics. We saw no one but them, (till night, when we happened to\r\ndiscover, in a remote subterranean corner, a warm, smoky, stone-cavern,\r\nin which a soldier, a stage-coachman, and others, were making merry\r\nwith ladies, _beer_, and song,) and them we saw only as we chose to.\r\nWe had a large, comfortable parlour, with dark-coloured furniture,\r\nof an age in which ease was not sacrificed to elegance; a dais and\r\nbow-window, old prints of Nelson’s victories and Garrick and Siddons in\r\nShakspearian characters, a smouldering sea-coal fire, several country\r\nnewspapers, and a second-hand last week’s Times. Preposterous orders\r\nwere listened to without a smile, receipts for novel Yankee dishes\r\ndistinctly understood in all their elaboration without impatience,\r\nand to the extent of the resources of the establishment faithfully\r\nexecuted. Only once was the mild business-manner of our hostess\r\ndisturbed by an appearance of surprise; when we told her that we were\r\nAmericans, she raised her eyes in blank incredulity, and asked, “You\r\ndon’t mean you were _born_ in America, sir?” The servants kept out of\r\nsight; our room was “put to rights,” our clothes arranged in a bureau,\r\nwhile we were at breakfast; and when we were seated, and had got fairly\r\nunder way with an excellent home-like dinner, the girl who acted for\r\nwaiter, seeming to understand our humour put a hand-bell on the table\r\nand withdrew, saying that we “would please to call her when we wanted\r\nany thing.”\r\n\r\nAlong the sides of many of the streets of Salisbury there flows, in\r\nlittle canals some six feet wide by two or three deep, with frequent\r\nbridges to the houses, a beautifully clear, rapid stream of water.\r\nOtherwise, the general appearance of the town is of meagre interest\r\ncompared with others we have been in. But it has one crowning glory—the\r\ncathedral.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral, in many of its parts, and from certain positions, as\r\na whole, is very beautiful; the clear, cutting, symmetrical spire,\r\nespecially against an evening sky, is very fine. It is taller by\r\nseveral feet than any other in England, though overtopped by several of\r\nthe Continental churches.\r\n\r\nWe have more pleasure in contemplating it, and enjoy more to wander\r\naround and through it, than any we have seen before. It is more\r\nsatisfactory to us. This, I believe, is partly because of its greater\r\nsize, partly because of its completeness, its unity: though six hundred\r\nyears old, you would not readily perceive in approaching it that it\r\nwas not entirely a new edifice; no repairs, no additions, especially\r\nno meddlesome restorations, which are almost always offensive to\r\nme. Its history is worthy of note with respect to this: it was only\r\nthirty-eight years in construction; except the spire, which was added\r\nrather later, and is more florid, which is to be regretted.\r\n\r\nWe admire and enjoy it, and yet not nearly so much as we should have\r\nexpected to from an imagination of what such a great, expensive, and\r\nartistic pile would be. You will wonder why. I don’t know that I can\r\ntell you. It fails in massiveness and grandeur. From some quarters it\r\nappears a mere _clutter_ of wall, windows, buttresses, and pinnacles,\r\neach of which may be fine enough in itself, but gaining nothing from\r\ntheir combination. There is nowhere a sufficient breadth and mass of\r\nwall, I suspect, to be grand. Once or twice only did it awaken any\r\nthing like a sense of sublimity, and then it did not appear to me to be\r\ndue to any architectural intention.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SALISBURY CATHEDRAL._]\r\n\r\nOnce, late in the day, and alone, I was walking from the end of one\r\ntransept towards the other, when an emotion came over me, partaking for\r\na moment of awe. Afterwards in trying to analyze what had occasioned\r\nit, I found that my face was turned towards two great, dark windows, a\r\nconsiderable space of unbroken wall about them, and a square, massive\r\nbuttress, all in the deep shade between the two transepts. From the\r\nsimple, solitary grandeur and solemnity of the dark recess, there had\r\ncome a sermon on humility and endurance to me, more eloquent than all\r\nelse of the great cathedral.\r\n\r\nThe wall over and behind this, in an equal space, was broken up by\r\nthree of the triple windows, which, look at the cathedral from any\r\ndirection you will, you see every where repeated, until the form\r\nbecomes tiresome and ugly. Not ugly in itself, but ugly, small, and\r\npaltry, by so much repetition in an edifice of such grandeur. If all\r\nthese windows, with all their form, proportion, colour, and fashion\r\nof carving, had been the work of one man, they were evidently that\r\nman’s _one idea_; if of many men, then they were servile imitations.\r\nOne would be, perhaps, a worthy and beautiful design—a hundred are\r\npaltry, ignominious, mechanical copies; they might be iron-castings,\r\nfor all the value the chisel has given them. Why should there not be,\r\nwith sufficient regard to _symmetrical uniformity_, evidence _in the\r\ndetails_ of every part of an edifice of such magnitude?\r\n\r\nThere is nothing original in these ideas, but they came upon me freshly\r\nand forcibly in trying to see why it was I did not feel more respect\r\nfor such a monument of architecture. I could not help thinking—It is\r\nvery fine, but it is a failure. Yet the simple beauty of proportion\r\nand the breadth of light and shade, in that little unimportant space, I\r\ndid feel truly and spontaneously.\r\n\r\nFrom all the little, but not unloving, study that I was able to give\r\nthe Old-World architecture, my advice to all building-committee\r\ngentlemen of no more cultivated taste than my own, (that to such these\r\ncrude thoughts may give hints of value, is my apology for printing\r\nthem,) would be, Stick to simplicity. The grand effect of architecture\r\nmust be from form and proportion. Favour designs, therefore, which,\r\nin their grand outlines, are at once satisfactory; then beware of\r\nenfeebling their strong features by childish ornaments and baby-house\r\nappendages. Simplicity of form is especially necessary to any thing\r\nlike dignity in an edifice of moderate size. There is a church in\r\nNew York, a cathedral in cabinet size, that one could hardly look at\r\nwithout being reminded of a grand dinner confectionary. The smallest\r\nparish churches of the old Saxon architecture, with thick, rude,\r\nunchiselled walls, strong enough to have needed no buttresses, and\r\ntherefore having none—a low square tower or belfry, with flat lead,\r\nroof, and a very few irregularly-placed, deep, round-arched windows and\r\nportals, I have found far more inspiring of the solemnity of humility\r\nwhich should accompany the formal worship of the Almighty, than most of\r\nthe very large churches that have been built with the greater wealth\r\nand more finical taste of later generations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Farmyard with thatched cottages, in front of hills.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALISBURY PLAIN.—STRANGE DESERT CHARACTER OF THE\r\nSCENERY.—THE AGRICULTURE.—SAINFOIN AND LUCERNE.—LARGE\r\nFARMS.—EFFECT ON LABOURERS.—PARING AND BURNING.—WHEN\r\nEXPEDIENT.—EXPENSE.—SHEEP-FOLDING.—MOVEABLE RAILWAYS AND SHEDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                            _June 17th._\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SCENERY OF SALISBURY PLAIN._]\r\n\r\n“Standing across the downs: course E. by N., _muggy_ weather and light\r\nairs,”—regularly _at sea_, without chart or compass. A strange, weary\r\nwaste of elevated land, undulating like a prairie, sparsely greened\r\nover its gray surfaces with short grass, uninhabited and treeless;\r\nonly, at some miles asunder, broken by charming vales of rich meadows\r\nand clusters of farm-houses and shepherds’ cottages, darkly bowered\r\nabout with the concentrated foliage of the whole country.\r\n\r\nFor long intervals we were entirely out of sight of tree or house or\r\nman, or even sign of man, more than an indistinct cart-track or trail.\r\nHad you any idea there was such a desert in England?\r\n\r\nThe trails run crookedly, divide and cross frequently, and only rarely\r\nis there a rude guide-post. Twice or thrice we were as completely lost\r\nas Oregon emigrants might be in the wilderness, and walked for miles\r\nwith only the dim, yellowish spot that stood for the sun in the misty\r\nfirmament, to be guided by. Large flocks, with shepherds and dogs, we\r\nsometimes saw, and here and there a square clump of beech or fir trees,\r\nintended probably as an occasional retreat for the sheep. More rarely\r\na great farm-house, with stacks and stables and great sheep-yards,\r\nalways so sheltered about by steep slopes and trees, close planted\r\nupon some artificially-elevated soil, that we came by chance and\r\nunexpectedly in near proximity before we saw them. Occasionally, too,\r\neven on the downs, and entirely unenclosed, there is cultivated land\r\n_and very large_ breadths of some single crop, much of good promise,\r\ntoo, but the wheat universally infested with charlock.\r\n\r\nBut the valleys are finely cultivated, and the crops, especially of\r\nsainfoin and lucerne, which is extensively grown here, very heavy.\r\n\r\n_Sainfoin_ and _lucerne_ are both forage crops, somewhat of the\r\ncharacter of clover. Sainfoin only succeeds well, I believe, on chalky\r\nsoils or where there is much lime, and has not been found of value in\r\nthe United States. Lucerne has been extensively cultivated in some\r\nparts, but not generally with us. I have heard of its doing well in a\r\ncold, bleak exposure upon our north-eastern coast, but it should have a\r\nwarm, rich soil, deeply cultivated, and be started well clean of weeds,\r\nwhen it may be depended upon to yield three to five heavy cuttings of\r\ngreen fodder, equal in value to clover, or three to seven tons of hay,\r\nof the value of which I am not well informed.\r\n\r\nThe valley lands are sometimes miles wide, and cultivation is extended\r\noften far up the hills. The farms are all very large, often including\r\na thousand acres of tillage land, and two, three, or four thousand of\r\ndown. A farm of less than a thousand acres is spoken of as small, and\r\nit often appears that one farmer, renting all the land in the vicinity,\r\ngives employment to all the people of a village. Whether it is owing to\r\nthis (to me) most repugnant state of things, or not, it is certainly\r\njust what I had expected to hear in connection with it, that labourers’\r\nwages are lower than any where else in England—seven, and sometimes\r\nsix, shillings ($1.68 and $1.44) being all that a man usually receives\r\nfor a week’s work.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _CULTIVATION OF THE DOWNS._]\r\n\r\nWe saw seven ploughs at work together, and thirteen swarths of lucerne\r\nfalling together before thirteen mowers, thirteen women following and\r\nshaking it out. It is not uncommon to have four or five hundred acres\r\nof wheat or two or three hundred of turnips growing on one farm. One\r\ndown farmer has eight hundred in wheat annually. The prairie farmer\r\nwould not despise such crops.\r\n\r\nAs there is no chalk soil in America, I will not dwell long upon its\r\npeculiarities or the system of agriculture adopted upon it. The manner\r\nin which the downs are brought into cultivation may, however, afford\r\nsome hints of value for the improvement of other poor, thin soils.\r\n“The sheepfold and artificial manures are looked upon as the mainstay\r\nof the Wiltshire down farmer. When the downs are first broken up, the\r\nland is invariably pared and burnt, and then sown with wheat. Barley\r\nis usually taken after wheat, and this is followed by turnips eaten\r\nupon the ground, and succeeded by wheat. It then falls into the usual\r\nfour or five-field course, a piece being laid out annually in sainfoin,\r\nto rest for several years before being broken up again. The sheepfold\r\nis shifted daily until the whole space required to be covered (_i.\r\ne._, manured) is gone over. Turnips and other green crops are consumed\r\nwhere they grow, which saves the labour of taking home the crop and\r\nfetching back the manure. The sheep are made the manure carriers for\r\nany portion of the land on which it is thought desirable to apply it.\r\nMuch of the corn crop is stacked in the distant fields, as it would be\r\nalmost impossible to carry it home so far, with the despatch necessary\r\nin harvest operations. In many cases it is thrashed where stacked, a\r\ntravelling steam-thrashing machine being hired for the purpose. The\r\nstraw is carried out and spread on the grass-lands from which clover\r\nhay had been cut the previous year. Only a small proportion of the root\r\ncrop is carried home for consumption by cattle, the number of which, in\r\nthese large farms, is quite inconsiderable.”[15]\r\n\r\n[15] CAIRD.\r\n\r\nSheep-folding, and paring and burning, are both processes nearly\r\nunknown in America, and which will probably be advantageously employed\r\nin some situations among us.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _PARING AND BURNING._]\r\n\r\n_Paring and burning._—“All soils,” says Sir Humphrey Davy, “that\r\ncontain too much dead vegetable fibre,” (such as the sour black soils\r\nof our reclaimed swamps,) “and all such as contain their earthy\r\nconstituents in an impalpable state of division, such as stiff clays\r\nand marls, are improved by _burning_.” It is therefore a common\r\npractice in the stiff-clay districts as well as upon the downs of\r\nEngland. In Suffolk, for instance, it has been adapted with most\r\nsuccessful results, the effect being to render the heavy clay soil\r\nlight, friable, porous, and highly absorbent of gaseous matters. It\r\nincreases the efficiency of drains, (by letting water more rapidly\r\ninto them,) and, being more friable, the land works better and at less\r\nexpense. It further promotes vegetation by converting into soluble\r\nmatters available to plants, vegetable remains; which, in consequence\r\nof the usually wet, impervious nature of the soil, have become, as\r\nit were, indigestible, and therefore inert and useless. It is also\r\nadvocated as being destructive of the roots and seeds of weeds; of\r\ninsects, their larvæ and eggs; and, as is pretty clearly demonstrated,\r\nit enables land to bear the same crop in quicker succession, by its\r\nsupposed effect upon the exudations left by former crops.[16] In\r\nexecuting the process, the surface, generally to the depth of three\r\ninches, is ploughed or pared up (there are instruments made on purpose\r\nfor it) and allowed to dry. It is then thoroughly harrowed and made\r\nfine; and in the downs the vegetable matter is raked out so far as\r\npracticable, and thrown into small heaps; a little earth is thrown over\r\nthese and they are fired, the grass forming the fuel. The remainder of\r\nthe earth which has been ploughed up is shovelled on as soon, and to as\r\ngreat a depth, as it can be without danger of extinguishing the fire.\r\n\r\n[16] Report by practical farmers in Suffolk, 1846.\r\n\r\nIn the clay districts and where there is much timber growing, brushwood\r\nis laid in rows, and the pared soil heaped over it, the sod being\r\nthrown as far as possible nearest the fuel, and the fine earth thrown\r\nover all to prevent too quick a fire.\r\n\r\nThe burnt soil is spread again over the field and ploughed in. The\r\nfirst crop following is usually turnips. The cost of the operation is\r\nreckoned, in Suffolk, (where it is called _denturing_,) to be only\r\nabout four dollars an acre, of which one-third is for fuel. Supposing\r\nthe expense of labour to be doubled and that of fuel halved for the\r\nUnited States, it may be expected to cost us six dollars an acre. The\r\neffect, probably, is never lost to the land; but in those parts of\r\nEngland where it is most practised, I believe it is usual to repeat the\r\noperation once in seven years, or at the beginning of every rotation.\r\nBy feeding turnips upon the ground the autumn following the burning, it\r\nis sufficiently stocked with manure to require no further application\r\nduring the course. Caird mentions crossing a field in which this had\r\nbeen repeated, burning every seven years, and no other application of\r\nmanure than what arose from the consumption of its own produce on the\r\nground being made, without any diminution of crops for fifty years.\r\n\r\nOn the downs, however, paring and burning is not usually resorted to,\r\nexcept at the first breaking up of the original soil, fertility being\r\nafterwards sustained by bones and guano, or by feeding off the crops\r\nof herbage at the end of every rotation by sheep; of which operation,\r\ncommon in all parts of Great Britain, I shall presently speak.\r\n\r\nIn land greatly infested with weeds, or grubs or wire-worm, in black,\r\npeaty soils, and in many stiff-clay soils, particularly where they are\r\nto be prepared for gardens or orchards, I have no doubt paring and\r\nburning often might be profitably performed in the United States. In\r\nthin, sandy soils it is likely to be injurious. If the soil has not a\r\npretty thick old sward, it will be best to sow some grain crop upon it\r\nthe year before burning, that the roots and stubble may afford fuel.\r\nOld pasture will be most readily burnt. In England, clay is sometimes\r\ncharred in pits, and, after being mashed fine, applied broadcast or\r\ndrilled with seeds, as a manure. It is sometimes found surprisingly\r\neffective, probably owing to its absorbent quality; but it is an\r\nexpensive operation, and has not generally recommended itself.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _MOVEABLE SHEEP-SHEDS._]\r\n\r\n_Sheep-folding_ is the practice of enriching a portion of ground by\r\nconfining sheep upon it. Thus, in Wiltshire, the flocks are pastured\r\nduring the day upon the _beak-land_ and kept at night upon the\r\ncomparatively small portion of ground which it is desired to manure,\r\nand which thus receives the benefit of the fertilizing droppings\r\nwhich have been obtained from the pastured ground; or a portion of a\r\nfield of sainfoin, or clover, or turnips, is enclosed by a moveable\r\nfence, (either iron or wooden hurdles or strong hempen nets fastened\r\nto stakes,) and the sheep confined to it until they have eaten the\r\ncrop clean, (they will eat the turnip in the ground,) and left upon\r\nit a large amount of excrement; the fence is then moved on to a fresh\r\nspot, where the process is repeated, and so on day after day until the\r\nrequired space has been travelled over.\r\n\r\nSometimes naked ground or stubble-land is thus served; turnips or\r\nsainfoin being brought from where they grow and fed within the\r\nhurdles, which are daily moved on a bit. Latterly, moveable sheds with\r\nslatted floors, running upon plank railroads, which are easily taken up\r\nand relaid across the turnip fields, have been tried. The object is to\r\navoid driving carts to take the crop off, or the treading of the sheep\r\nto feed it, on the ground, upon heavy clay soils, in which the pressure\r\nof these operations must be very objectionable. Twelve sheep are kept\r\nin each shed-car, and the turnips pulled and thrown in to them. The\r\nexpense of drawing off the crop and returning the manure is avoided,\r\nand the sheep have shelter and a dry bed, while the ordinary custom\r\nsubjects them to danger of foot-rot and other diseases, and also must\r\nbe attended with some waste of the crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ARCADIAN HAMLET.—OUT OF THE WORLD, BUT NOT BEYOND THE REACH\r\nOF THE YANKEE PEDDLER.—THE COTTAGES OF THE DOWNS.—GROUT AND\r\nCOBBLE-STONES.—CHARACTER OF THE LABOURING CLASS OF THE DOWNS.—WANT\r\nOF CURIOSITY.—OLD STOCKBRIDGE, WINCHESTER, WILLIAM OF WYKEHAM.—HIS\r\nLEGACY TO WAYFARERS.—THE CATHEDRAL.—SOME REMARKS ON ARCHITECTURAL\r\nSITUATION.—SEARCH FOR LODGINGS.—MOTHERLY KINDNESS.—RAILROAD\r\nMISMANAGEMENT.—WATERLOO DAY AT PORTSMOUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _OLD CONNECTICUT._]\r\n\r\nWallop, where we spend the night, is a most poetical hamlet, so hidden\r\nby trees, that as we came over the downs, after we were within a few\r\nmoments’ walk of it, we had to inquire where it was. It is a narrow\r\nroad and string of cottages some miles long, by the bank of a cool,\r\nsilvery brook, at which, when we first saw it, we rushed to drink\r\nlike camels in the desert; and the water was indeed delicious. It is\r\nan exceedingly quiet, peaceful place. As we sit at our window at the\r\n“Lower George,” we can hear nothing but the rippling of the brook,\r\nwhich threads its way through the trees and among the cottages across\r\nthe street, the rustling of the trees in the gentle air, the peeping\r\nof chickens, and the chirping of small birds. There is a blacksmith’s\r\nshop, but no smoke ascends from it, and the anvil is silent. There is\r\na grist-mill further down; there is a little, square, heavy-roofed\r\nschoolhouse, and there is a church and graveyard. But there is no\r\nstage-coach, no public conveyance, not even a carrier’s cart by which\r\nwe might send on our packs, runs through or from the hamlet. Yet\r\nthis is a good inn, clean, and well provided; we have a large room,\r\ncomfortably furnished, and the landlord seems to understand what a\r\ntired traveller wants; and down stairs, in the parlour, there is—would\r\nyou ever guess? It tells its own story thus:—\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n                         “IMPROVED BRASS CLOCK,\r\n\r\n                             MANUFACTURED BY\r\n\r\n                   H. WELTON, TERRYVILLE, CONNECTICUT.\r\n\r\n                      (_Warranted, if well used._”) ]\r\n\r\nIt cost twelve shillings, and was a capital time-piece, only lately it\r\nhad got a-going too fast, and the landlord wished Mr. Welton would send\r\nhis man over and have it fixed according to contract. It marked the\r\nhour rather behind our watches, but as it was the liveliest thing in\r\nthe village, we have set it back to the landlord’s notion, lengthened\r\nthe pendulum, and oiled the “pallet,” all to save the reputation of Mr.\r\nWelton and the universal Yankee nation.\r\n\r\nThe cottages here are generally built of a chalk grout, sometimes\r\nwith lines of flint stones for ornament. In others, flint pebbles are\r\nlaid regularly in tiers set in grout, like the “cobble-stone houses”\r\nin western New York; in others, grout, and stones set in grout,\r\nalternately; or brick and stone in grout, in alternate tiers a foot\r\nthick. The village fences and the stock-yard walls about here are also\r\nmade of white grout, very thick, and with a coping of thatch. The\r\nthatch on the cottages is very heavy, sometimes two feet deep.\r\n\r\nThe labouring class upon the downs have generally a quiet, sleepy,\r\nstupid expression, with less evident viciousness and licentious\r\ncoarseness of character, and with more simplicity, frankness, and\r\ngood-nature, than those we have previously been among. The utter want\r\nof curiosity and intelligent observation, among a people living so\r\nretired from the busy world, is remarkable. We have met but two to-day\r\nwhose minds showed any inclination to move of their own accord: one\r\nof them was a pensioned soldier who had served at Halifax, and who\r\nmade inquiries about several old comrades who had deserted and escaped\r\nto “the States,” and whom he seemed to suppose we must have seen as\r\nwe were Yankees; the other, an old woman in Newtown-Tawney, at whose\r\ncottage we stopped to get water; she had at first taken us, as we came\r\none after the other over the stile, for a “detachment of the Rifles,”\r\nand on discovering her error was quite anxious to know what we were and\r\nwhat we were after, what we carried in our knapsacks, &c.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                            _June 18th._\r\n\r\nIn the morning we walked from Wallop through Stockbridge to Winchester.\r\nA down-land district still, as yesterday, but a well-travelled road,\r\nwith houses, inns, and guide-boards; more frequent plantations of trees\r\nand more cultivated land, yet but little of it is fenced, and the\r\nsheep are restrained from crops by shepherds and dogs. Since we left\r\nSalisbury we have seen but three cows, each of which was tethered or\r\ntied to a woman or child. We have seen no donkeys for the last hundred\r\nmiles.\r\n\r\nStockbridge is a small village of one wide street, with two clear\r\nstreams and a canal crossing it, the surface of the ground a dead flat;\r\nall as unlike its Massachusetts namesake as it is to a Pawnee village.\r\nWe saw some fine horses near here.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _WILLIAM OF WYKEHAM._]\r\n\r\nWinchester—a name we remember as that of the school-place of many a\r\ngood man—is an interesting old town in a cleft of the downs. All who\r\nhave heard Mr. Emerson’s lecture upon England will remember it also as\r\nthe town of “_William of Wykeham_.”\r\n\r\nWe visited the cathedral, the college, and the other notable\r\ninstitutions and monuments, and demanded and received our share of the\r\nlegacy bequeathed by William of Wykeham, five hundred years ago, to all\r\nwayfarers passing by—a generous slice of good bread, and a draught of\r\nale, served in an ancient horn. There is certainly _no humbug_ about\r\nit, but the good bishop’s hospitable will, in this particular, is yet\r\nas sincerely executed as if by servants under his own eye. Mr. Emerson\r\nwas, nevertheless, unfortunate in his eloquent use of this circumstance\r\nto illustrate the simple honesty of English character, and the\r\npermanence and reliability of English institutions; for it now appears\r\nthat, notwithstanding the substantial bread and unadulterated beer,\r\nthis is but the cleanliness of the cup and platter, and that in the\r\nreal and worthy legacy which the far-reaching piety of the good prelate\r\nleft to the future of England, there is much rottenness. Generally, the\r\nmeans which the piety of Englishmen of former generations bequeathed,\r\nfor the furnishing to the poor aliment of mind, have been notoriously\r\nwrenched aside to the emolument and support, in luxurious sinecures,\r\nof a few individuals, whom, but for the association of their _titles_\r\nwith religion, loyalty, law, and order, and the poor conscience-salve\r\nthat it is the system and not they that are wrong, every man would know\r\nfor perjured hypocrites, liars, swindlers; far more detestable than\r\nAmerican repudiators, French sycophants, or Irish demagogues.\r\n\r\nThe cathedral is low and heavy, covering much ground; and exhibits,\r\ncuriously interworked, the styles of Saxon, Norman, and early and later\r\nEnglish architects. I again wrote in my note-book, “unimpressive;” but\r\nnow, after two years, I find that my mind was strongly, though it\r\nwould seem unconsciously, impressed by it; for there returns to me,\r\nas I very vividly remember its appearance, a feeling of quiet, wholly\r\nuncritical _veneration_, of which I believe a part must be due to the\r\nbreadth of green turf of the graveyard, and deep shade of the old trees\r\nin which it is upreared. There were scarcely any edifices that I saw\r\nin Europe that produced in me the slightest thrill of such emotion\r\nfrom sublimity as I have often had in contemplation of the ocean, or\r\nof mountains, that it was not plainly due less to the architectural\r\nstyle, than to the connection and harmony of the mass with the ground\r\nupon which it was placed. The only church that stopped me suddenly with\r\na sensation of deep solemnity, as I came unexpectedly _under_ it, as\r\nit were, in turning the corner of a street, was one that stood upon a\r\nbold, natural terrace, and in which the lines of the angles of a heavy\r\ntower were continuous and unbroken from base to summit.\r\n\r\nAt half-past six we took seats in the second-class cars for Portsmouth,\r\nand were favoured with a specimen of a corporation’s disregard for\r\nthe convenience of the public, and the accomplishment of their own\r\npromises, that a _New Jerseyman_ would almost have growled at. There\r\nwas a full hour’s unnecessary detention at the way-stations, and after\r\nhaving arrived near the terminus, that much behind the time-tables, the\r\ntickets were collected and the doors locked upon us, and we were kept\r\nwaiting a long time within a few rods of the station-house. Some one\r\nat length got out at the windows, but was sent back by the guard. When\r\nwe requested to know what was the objection to our leaving, we were\r\nanswered it was against the rules of the company for any passengers to\r\nbe allowed upon the ground without the station. After waiting some time\r\nlonger, we rose in numbers too strong for the guards, who, however,\r\npromised that we should be prosecuted for trespass, and made our\r\nescape. I may say, in passing, that the speed upon the English roads\r\nis, _on an average_, not better than on ours. It is commonly only from\r\nfifteen to twenty miles an hour. The express trains, however, upon\r\nthe main lines, run usually as fast as fifty miles an hour, sometimes\r\nsixty. For the accommodation, comfort, and advantage of all but those\r\nwho choose and can afford to pay extravagantly, their whole railroad\r\nsystem is very inferior to ours.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A HOLIDAY NIGHT._]\r\n\r\nIt was _Waterloo Day_, and there had been a review of the forces at\r\nPortsmouth, before the Duke of Wellington and Prince Albert; the Queen\r\nhad been off the harbour in her yacht, and received a salute; there\r\nhad been a balloon ascension; there had been a carousal with long and\r\neloquently-reported speeches, and in one way and the other a great\r\ndeal of powder and gas spent. There was to be an illumination yet, and\r\nthe town was full—some of the streets packed with soldiers and sailors\r\nand women. We spent several hours trying to get lodgings; every hotel,\r\ninn, tavern, and lodging-house, high and low, was full. The best thing\r\nthat kindness or covetousness could be induced to offer, was room to\r\nlay upon a carpet on the floor, and this nowhere that we thought it\r\nlikely we should be allowed to sleep. We got supper somewhere, and the\r\nlandlady informed us frankly that she charged us twice as much for it\r\nas she usually would, because it was “holiday.”\r\n\r\nIt was late at night when, by advice of policemen and favour of\r\nsentinels, we had passed out through a series of ramparts, and were\r\ngoing up a broad street of the adjoining town of Portsea. “Good-night,\r\nmy dear,” we heard a kindly-toned voice; and a woman closed a door,\r\nand, after walking on a moment, ascended the steps to another. “Could\r\nyou be good enough, madam,” one of us took the liberty of inquiring,\r\n“to tell us of any house in this vicinity where we should be likely to\r\nobtain lodging for the night?”\r\n\r\n“No—dear me!—who are you?”\r\n\r\n“We are strangers in the town; travellers, who reached here this\r\nevening, and we have been looking for several hours to find some place\r\nwhere we could sleep, but all the inns are full.”\r\n\r\n“Come here; let me look at you. You are _young_ men, are you not? come\r\nup to me, you need not be afraid—yes, I see; youths” (we had caps on,\r\nwhich is unusual in England except for school-boys). “Why, poor youths,\r\nI am sorry for you—strangers—you wait here, and I will call my servant\r\nand see if she does not think she can find where you can get a bed.”\r\n\r\nShe then went in, and in a few minutes returned with a maid whom she\r\ncalled Susan, to whom she repeated what we had said; and then inquired\r\nfurther what was our business, were we “travelling with the consent of\r\nour parents,” &c., and remarked—“Your parents are _reputable people_, I\r\nthink:—yes—yes—dear me!—yes—poor youths. Yes, I will find beds for you.\r\nYou are good youths, and Susan shall—but come in: you will sit in the\r\nparlour, and my servant, Susan, shall sit with you a few minutes, and I\r\nwill see. Come in, come in, good youths.”\r\n\r\nWhile we remained in the parlour it was infinitely droll to hear the\r\nkind old woman talking with another in the next room about the safety\r\nand propriety of lodging us. “_I have known the world_, and I cannot be\r\ndeceived: these are _good youths_.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A HOLIDAY NIGHT._]\r\n\r\nIt was at length concluded that if we would each of us pay a shilling,\r\n(“and then we could give whatever we liked besides to _Susan_,”) and if\r\nwe would be willing to have our doors locked on the outside, we should\r\nbe provided then and there with beds. The old woman then came in again\r\nto us, and with great severity re-examined us, and finally informed\r\nus that we were to spend the night in her house. She then became\r\nexceedingly kind again, asked much about our parents and America, and\r\nat length asked us, with a whimpering laugh, as if she feared how\r\nwe would take it, but begged that it might be considered a joke—“We\r\nwouldn’t be offended if our doors should be locked on the outside?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DECEIT OF DESCRIPTIONS OF SCENERY.—THE SOUL OF A LANDSCAPE.—THE\r\nISLE OF WIGHT, ITS CHARACTERISTICS.—APPROPRIATE DOMESTIC\r\nARCHITECTURE.—GENIAL CLIMATE.—TROPICAL VERDURE.—THE CLIFFS OF\r\nALBION.—OSBORNE.—THE ROYAL VILLA.—COUNTRY LIFE OF THE ROYAL\r\nFAMILY.—AGRICULTURAL INCLINATION AND RURAL TASTES.—THE ROYAL\r\nTENANTRY.—A RURAL FETE AT OSBORNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _FAVOUR OF NATURE._]\r\n\r\nThere is always a strong temptation upon the traveller to endeavour\r\nto so describe fine scenery, and the feelings which it has occasioned\r\nhim, that they may be reproduced to the imagination of his friends.\r\nJudging from my own experience, this purpose always fails. I have never\r\nyet seen any thing celebrated in scenery, of which I had previously\r\nobtained a correct conception. Certain striking, prominent points,\r\nthat the power of language has been most directed to the painting of,\r\nalmost invariably disappoint, and seem little and commonplace, after\r\nthe exaggerated forms which have been brought before the mind’s eye.\r\nBeauty, grandeur, impressiveness in any way, from scenery, is not often\r\nto be found in a few prominent, distinguishable features, but in the\r\nmanner and the unobserved materials with which these are connected and\r\ncombined. Clouds, lights, states of the atmosphere, and circumstances\r\nthat we cannot always detect, affect all landscapes, and especially\r\nlandscapes in which the vicinity of a body of water is an element, much\r\nmore than we are often aware. So it is that the impatient first glance\r\nof the young traveller, or the impertinent critical stare of the old\r\ntourist, is almost never satisfied, if the honest truth be admitted, in\r\nwhat it has been led to previously imagine. I have heard “Niagara is a\r\nmill-dam,” “Rome is a humbug.”\r\n\r\nThe deep sentiments of Nature that we sometimes seem to have been made\r\nthe confidant of, when among the mountains, or on the moors or the\r\nocean,—even those of man wrought out in architecture and sculpture and\r\npainting, or of man working in unison with Nature, as sometimes in\r\nthe English parks, on the Rhine, and here on the Isle of Wight,—such\r\nrevealings are beyond words; they never could be transcribed into\r\nnote-books and diaries, and so descriptions of them become caricatures,\r\nand when we see them, we at first say we are disappointed that we find\r\nnot the monsters we were told of.\r\n\r\nDame Nature is a gentlewoman. No guide’s fee will obtain you her\r\nfavour, no abrupt demand; hardly will she bear questioning, or direct,\r\ncurious gazing at her beauty; least of all, will she reveal it truly\r\nto the hurried glance of the passing traveller, while he waits for his\r\ndinner, or fresh horses, or fuel and water; always we must quietly and\r\nunimpatiently wait upon it. Gradually and silently the charm comes over\r\nus; the beauty has entered our souls; we know not exactly when or how,\r\nbut going away we remember it with a tender, subdued, filial-like joy.\r\n\r\nDoes this seem nonsense to you? Very likely, for I am talking of what I\r\ndon’t understand. Nature treats me so strangely; it’s past my speaking\r\nsensibly of, and yet, as a part of my travelling experience, I would\r\nspeak of it. At times I seem myself to be her favourite, and she brings\r\nme to my knees in deep feeling, such as she blesses no other with;\r\noftener I see others in ecstasies, while I am left to sentimentalize\r\nand mourn, or to be critical, and sneering, and infidel. Nonsense\r\nstill; but tell me, do you think it is only for greed of trouts that\r\nyour great and sensitive man lingers long, intently stooping over dark\r\npools in the spray of the mountain torrents, or stealing softly a way\r\nthrough the bending rushes, or kneeling lowly on the darkest verdure of\r\nthe shaded meadow? What else? I know not what he thinks, but of this I\r\nam assured: while his mind is most intent upon his trivial sport, his\r\nheart and soul will be far more absorbent of the rugged strength, the\r\ndiffuse, impetuous brilliance, the indefinite gliding grace, or the\r\npeaceful twilight loveliness, of the scenes around him, than if he went\r\nout searching, labouring directly for it as for bread and fame.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the Isle of Wight is more dreary, desolate, bare,\r\nand monotonous, than any equal extent of land you probably ever saw\r\nin America—would be, rather, if it were not that you are rarely out\r\nof sight of the sea; and no landscape, of which that is a part,\r\never can be without variety and ever-changing interest. It is, in\r\nfact, _down-land_ in the interior, exactly like that I described in\r\nWiltshire, and sometimes breaking down into such bright dells as I\r\nthere told of. But on the south shore it is rocky, craggy; and after\r\nyou have walked through a rather dull country, though pleasing on the\r\nwhole, for hours after landing, you come gradually to where the majesty\r\nof vastness, peculiar to the downs and the ocean, alternates or mingles\r\nwith dark, picturesque, rugged ravines, chasms, and water-gaps, sublime\r\nrock-masses, and soft, warm, smiling, inviting dells and dingles; and,\r\nwithal, there is a strange and fascinating enrichment of half-tropical\r\nfoliage, so deep, graceful, and luxuriant, as I never saw before any\r\nwhere in the world. All this district is thickly inhabited, and yet so\r\nwell covered with verdure, or often so tastefully appropriate—quiet,\r\ncosy, ungenteel, yet elegant—are the cottages, that they often add\r\nto, rather than insult and destroy, the natural charm of their\r\nneighbourhood. I am sorry to say, that among the later erections\r\nthere are a number of very strong exceptions to this remark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Small house on a hill]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _VICTORIA AT HOME._]\r\n\r\nIn this paradise the climate, by favour of its shelter of hills on the\r\nnorth, and the equalising influence of the ocean on the south, is,\r\nperhaps, the most equable and genial in the northern temperate zone.\r\nThe mercury does not fall as low in winter as at Rome; deciduous trees\r\nlose their verdure but for a brief interval; greensward is evergreen;\r\ntender-roses, fuschias, and the dark, glossy shrubs of Canaan and of\r\nFlorida, feel themselves at home, and flourish through the winter.\r\n\r\nWhere the chalky _downs_ reach the shore without an intervening barrier\r\nof rock, or a gradual sloping descent, they are broken off abruptly\r\nand precipitously; and thus are formed the “white cliffs of _Albion_,”\r\nand a coast scenery with which, for grandeur, there is nothing on our\r\nAtlantic shore that will in the least compare: notwithstanding which,\r\nand although they really are often higher than our church-steeples and\r\nmonuments—the familiar _standards_ with which we compare their number\r\nof feet—they have not the stupendous effect upon the mind that I had\r\nalways imagined that they must have.\r\n\r\nWe were rambling for the greater part of two days upon the island,\r\nspending a night near Black-gang-Chine. Returning, we passed near\r\nOsborne, a private estate purchased some years since by the Queen,\r\nupon which she has had erected a villa, said to be an adaptation of\r\nthe Grecian style to modern tastes and habits, but of which nothing is\r\nto be seen from without the grounds but the top of a lofty campanile,\r\nfrom which is now displayed the banner with the royal arms, which\r\nalways indicates the presence of the reigning sovereign of Great\r\nBritain. It is the custom of the royal family, when here, to live\r\nin as retired and unstately a way as they can ever be permitted\r\nto. The Prince himself turns farmer, and engages with much ardour\r\nin improving the agricultural capabilities of the soil, much of\r\nwhich was not originally of a fertile character, but by thorough\r\ndrainage, and judicious tillage and manuring, is now producing greatly\r\nenlarged crops. The Prince is well known as a successful breeder and\r\nstockfarmer, having taken several prizes for fat cattle, &c., at the\r\ngreat annual shows. Her Majesty personally interests herself in the\r\nembellishment of the grounds and the extensive oak plantations which\r\nare being made, and is in the habit of driving herself a pair of\r\nponies, unattended, through the estate, studying the comfort of her\r\nlittle cottage tenantry, and in every way she can trying to seem to\r\nherself the good-wife of a respectable country gentleman.\r\n\r\nOn the last birth-day of Prince Albert, a dinner was given to the\r\nlabourers on the estate, with the seamen, boys, and marines of the\r\nRoyal Yacht, and the coast-guard and soldiers stationed in the\r\nneighbourhood, (altogether about four hundred persons.) The dinner\r\nwas provided in a large tent which was pitched on the lawn in front\r\nof the house, and consisted of a plentiful supply of beef, mutton,\r\nand plum-pudding, with strong ale. After grace had been said by the\r\nbailiff, (overseer,) and the company were seated, the Queen and Prince\r\nwalked through the tent, and at the conclusion, after the usual loyal\r\ntoasts, all adjourned to the greensward without, and in the presence\r\nof all the royal family engaged in a country dance, and afterwards\r\nin foot-races and in games of cricket and football, and other\r\nold-fashioned rural sports, the Queen remaining with them for several\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUEEN’S YACHT.—YACHTS OF THE R. Y. CLUB, THEIR BUILD AND\r\nRIG.—COMPARISON WITH AMERICAN YACHTS AND PILOT-BOATS.—SEAMANSHIP.—CUT\r\nOF SAILS.—THE NAVY-YARD AT PORTSMOUTH.—GUN-BOATS.—STEAMERS.—NAVAL\r\nFORCE OF GREAT BRITAIN.—EVENING AT PORTSEA.—CURIOSITY.—ABOUT BOASTING\r\nAND SOME ENGLISH CHARACTERISTICS.—CONVERSATION WITH A SHOPKEEPER ON\r\n“THE GLORY OF ENGLAND.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ROYAL YACHT-CLUB SQUADRON._]\r\n\r\nIn crossing the Solent, on our return to Portsmouth, we saw the Queen’s\r\nyacht, and passed through a squadron of the Royal Yacht-Club yachts.\r\nThe former was a large, heavily-hampered, brig-rigged steamer, with\r\ngreat plate-glass ports, and a large oak-coloured house on deck, less\r\nseaman-like in appearance and more in the American style than most\r\nEnglish steam-vessels. The yachts were as sweet craft as I can imagine,\r\nmost of them over two hundred tons in burden and schooner-rigged; but,\r\nwhether one or two-masted, spreading more canvas for the length of\r\ntheir hulls than I ever saw before. They were all painted black, and\r\ntheir ornaments and deck-arrangements struck me as being more simple,\r\nsnug, and seaman-like than those of most of our Union Clubs’ yachts.\r\nThe reverse is the case aloft. My _guess_ was that they would be more\r\nthan a match for any thing on our side in light winds, but that in bad\r\nweather, particularly if working to windward, they would do nothing\r\nagainst a New York pilot-boat. Like all the English small craft, when\r\ngoing before the wind, the cutters and schooners always hauled up\r\nthe tack of the mainsail that the wind might draw under it to fill\r\nthe foresail and jib. Another reason given for it is, that the wind,\r\ndrawing downward from the belly of the sail, tends to make the vessel\r\n_bury_, and by lifting the tack she is made more buoyant. It is never\r\ndone in America.\r\n\r\nMy opinion is, that the superior sailing of the “America,” in the great\r\nmatches of 1851, was _more_ owing to her peculiarities of rig, the cut\r\nand material of her sails, and to seamanship, than to the model of her\r\nhull. I have no doubt we can still build and rig a vessel that will be\r\nher superior. While the English stick to flax canvas, long gaffs, heavy\r\ntopsails, and graceful curves, I do not think there is any danger that\r\nthey will. When the Englishman is close-hauled with his boom as near\r\namidships as he can get it, his long gaff will swing off so far that\r\nthere _must_ always be a considerable part of his canvas in the peak\r\nthat actually retards more than it assists him. The Englishman thinks\r\nmuch of beauty of form in his sails, but his standard of beauty is\r\narbitrary—a fashion. To my eye, without regard to the primary beauty of\r\nutility, the simplicity of the cut of our sails is much more agreeable.\r\n\r\nOn the deck of the flag-schooner, which we ran very near to, we saw the\r\ncommodore of the Club, (an Earl,) a gray-haired old gentleman, who sat\r\nin an arm-chair, reading from a newspaper to some ladies.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn reaching Portsmouth we took a boat to visit the navy-yard, within\r\nthe walls of which, _being foreigners_, not having a pass, we could not\r\nenter. Our boatmen told us that if we chose to enter we should not be\r\nchallenged, as no one would suspect us as being other than Englishmen,\r\nand that the prohibition was a silly old form that prevented no one\r\nfrom seeing the yard that wished to enough to lie for it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _NAVAL FORCE OF GREAT BRITAIN._]\r\n\r\nThe number of vessels (of the navy) in port was much less than I had\r\nanticipated seeing, and most of these were hulks, or _advance_ ships,\r\n(with guns and water-tanks on board.) Those we went on board of, (one\r\nof them ready for sea,) seemed to me, compared with ours of the same\r\nclass, inferior in all respects, except it might be in some novelties\r\nin their rigging, of the efficiency of which I could not judge. The\r\nextent to which wire-rigging was employed in some of them surprised me.\r\nWe saw four gun-boats, (large barges with a swivel-gun in the bow,)\r\nmanned by the workmen of the yard, whose awkward evolutions were very\r\namusing. The landsmen working in the yard are divided into two squads,\r\none of which, alternately with the other, is drilled in the Jefferson\r\nplan of harbour defence two evenings in each week. They are dressed in\r\na simple uniform, and armed as boarders.\r\n\r\nThere were more steamers in the harbour than in all our navy.\r\n\r\nThe present naval force of Great Britain, by official returns, consists\r\nof 671 ships of war, either in ordinary or in commission, varying\r\nfrom 2 to 120 guns each; of this number 187 are armed steamers. This\r\nfleet, the largest of any maritime power on the globe, employs in time\r\nof peace, 35,000 to 40,000 able-bodied seamen, 2000 strong lads, and\r\n13,000 royal marines, consisting of 102 companies, divided into four\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\nThe American navy consists of 70 vessels, large and small, of which 8\r\nare sea-steamers.\r\n\r\nThe army of Great Britain, _exclusive_ of the East India Company’s\r\ntroops, and several native colonial regiments, numbers 135,000 men;\r\nabout 80,000 of these are considered available for home-service, the\r\nremainder being required for the defence of the colonies.\r\n\r\nThe regular army of the United States consists of 10,300 men. The\r\nmilitia force is returned as over 2,000,000.\r\n\r\n  The army of Russia     numbers 675,000 men.\r\n        ”     France        ”    400,000  ”\r\n        ”     Austria       ”    400,000  ”\r\n        ”     Sardinia      ”    140,000  ”\r\n        ”     Spain         ”    100,000  ”\r\n        ”     Great Britain ”    135,000  ”\r\n        ”     United States ”     10,000  ”\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ENGLISH CHARACTERISTICS._]\r\n\r\nIn the evening we called at the old lady’s in Portsea, and received\r\nfrom Susan some clothes, which she had undertaken to get washed for\r\nus, and a watch which my brother had left in his bedroom. The kind old\r\nwoman received us cordially, apologized again for the prudence which\r\nhad led her to lock us in, and introduced us to some friends. Of their\r\nsimplicity and curiosity, as shown in their questioning of us, I might,\r\nif I chose to report our conversations, give as amusing a picture as\r\nEnglish travellers enjoy to do, of that of those they meet in American\r\nboarding-houses. Of fidgetty anxiety lest we should not discover that\r\nevery body and every thing in the country is most astonishing and\r\nwonderfully superior to any body and any thing every where else in\r\nthe world, which so distresses visitors to the United States, I must\r\nconfess that we have seen but little in England. With the poorer class\r\nof Englishmen, patriotism seems to have been starved out. If they ever\r\nspeak of their country’s greatness and prosperity, it is as a servant\r\nspeaks of his master’s wealth; they would see it become a dependency of\r\nFrance or Russia with entire indifference, certainly with exultation if\r\nit were promised them that wages should be higher and bread cheaper for\r\nit. Again, the Radicals and men of earnest religious faith, with the\r\nstrongest affection to their country, are in the habit of looking much\r\nat what is wrong and shameful in her institutions and qualities, and\r\nof comparing them with what is better in other lands. There has always\r\nbeen a great many—now almost enough to be looked upon as a party—that\r\nhave a strong admiration for our country, and who even glory in all our\r\nglory as their own.\r\n\r\nCultivated and large-minded people of all classes, of course, in\r\nEngland as every where else, rise above prejudice and vanity, and think\r\nand speak fairly and frankly equally of their own or foreign states;\r\nof such eminently we recognise the Earl of Carlisle and Sir Charles\r\nLyell, and of such are, I believe, a great number of the higher rank\r\nof commercial men. The traditional self-complacency of an Englishman,\r\nas an Englishman, is more often to be detected, at the present day, by\r\nsome unnecessary pains he will take to point out to you deficiencies\r\nand defects of a trivial character in the article or institution\r\nor custom you are considering, he having entire confidence that in\r\ncontrast with that of any other country it will but be exalted by any\r\nsuch faint disparagement of it as is possible. Among the lower class in\r\ntowns, or in the country those who have been servants, or in some way\r\nconnected with or dependent on wealthy old families, there is sometimes\r\nto be found the most ludicrously absurd old Tory ideas and prejudices,\r\nquite in character with the John Bull of the old farce; but the best\r\nspecimens of it that I have seen were among the smaller sort of\r\nshopkeepers, particularly those who advertised themselves to be under\r\nthe patronage of some noble lady. I remember one that we encountered,\r\nsoon after we resumed our walks in England after we had been on the\r\nContinent, that amused us very much—a little, fat, florid, bald-headed\r\nJohn Gilpin of a man. He was wrapping the article we had purchased in a\r\npaper, and, while we waited, asked,\r\n\r\n“_Travellers_, gentlemen?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“On foot, it appears?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Travelled far, so might I ask?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes—a number of hundred miles.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed—you must have seen a good bit of old England.... Ever was on\r\nthe Continent, gentlemen?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“In France, it might be?”\r\n\r\n“Yes.”\r\n\r\n“Any where else but France?”\r\n\r\n“Yes—in Holland, Germany, and Belgium.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!... Gentlemen, I should like to ask you now, if I might be so bold,\r\nI should like to ask you a question, just one question. I haven’t\r\nbeen myself, you see, to France nor to Holland nor to those other\r\ncountries, but I have read of them, and according to the best sources\r\nof information I could reach, I have informed my mind about them and\r\nformed my own independent opinion, you see, in which I may be right,\r\nof course, and I may be wrong, but I think I’m right. And I have had a\r\ncoming in here a many of travelling gentlemen like you, that had seen\r\nall those foreign countries, and had also in course seen England,—which\r\nis advantageous. Well, I always asks these gentlemen one question when\r\nthey does me the honour, and they have always been so good as to answer\r\nme with the very same identical, and now I should be pleased to ask\r\nyou the same question, if I may be so bold. Though, to be sure, I can\r\nimagine what you’ll answer, but then to confirm the independent, which\r\nI had arrived at from my own, you see, and for edification,—thank you.\r\nNow then, gentlemen—(John, you can discontinue a moment.)”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “_THE GLORY OF ENGLAND._”]\r\n\r\nHe laid the parcel on the counter, and, holding it firmly with his left\r\nhand, continued to tap it lightly with the fore-finger of the other,\r\nlooking at us as if our lives depended upon our answering truthfully.\r\n\r\n“So it appears, gentlemen, (if I might be so bold,) that you have\r\nwandered far and near over the face of the inhabited world, and have\r\nseen many foreign parts and lands, and cast your lot among other\r\npeoples and nations, that all thought as their inheritances was\r\nvery fine, doubtless: but now, _gentlemen!_ can you say on candid\r\nreflection—now have you ever seen any where’s else, for instance, any\r\ncastle as was comparable compared to _Winsor_ Castle?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Or any park like unto Winsor Park—that is, in foreign parts?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Nor any country of them all, what, on the whole, take her altogether,\r\ntaking her castles and parks, also her towns and her rail’ays and\r\nstation-houses, her forests and her manufactures, and her coal and\r\niron; her church and her constitution, her people and her horses, and\r\nsuch like—did you ever, in all your wanderings—taking her altogether\r\nso—did you ever now, gentlemen—I want to know—ever see any place\r\nexactly like your own country after all?”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed, sir.”\r\n\r\n“‘No, indeed, sir!’ I know you didn’t—you hear that? ‘No, indeed,\r\nsir’—and so say you all, gentlemen? and so say you all. Well, then, I\r\nam satisfied, and much obliged to you, gentlemen. There isn’t none of\r\nthe foreign principalities that is like this blessed land; and that’s\r\nwhat I am always telling them, and only goes to confirm the independent\r\nconviction which I had previously arrived to of my own preliminaries.\r\nThank you, gentlemen;” (handing us the parcel;) “good-morning. I wish\r\nyou a pleasant continuance of your promenade in our glorious old land.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nRURAL POLICE.—THE “ANCHOR” INN.—THE GARDEN.—“OLD COACHING\r\nTIMES.”—HEATH LAND.—A DREARY LANDSCAPE.—MURDER AND A HIGHWAY\r\nADVENTURE.—HUMAN VANITY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                   _Liphook, June 20th._\r\n\r\nWalked hither from Portsmouth to-day. For twenty miles the road is\r\nthrough a hilly chalk country, much of it unenclosed downs, generally\r\ninteresting, and the walk at this season agreeable.\r\n\r\nWe had, for a short distance, the company of a rural policeman. He had\r\nhis quarters, with several others, in a small cottage in a village,\r\nwas paid $4.70 a-week, and furnished with three suits of clothes every\r\nyear—one for winter, one for summer, and one for Sundays, besides\r\ngloves, &c. The uniform is of blue cloth, of a simple, semi-military\r\nfashion. He said no one was employed in the force who was less than\r\nsix feet high, and that they were exercised in the use of small-arms.\r\nOf duties he seemed to have no definite idea himself, but was ready to\r\ndo any thing he could in the way of fighting roguery, when he should\r\nbe called upon by the officers. The only crime which he seemed to\r\napprehend in the neighbourhood was _rick-burning_—labourers who were\r\ndiscontented and envious, or who had for any reason become angry with\r\nthe farmers who employed them, setting fire to their stacks of grain.\r\nThis was common.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “_OLD COACHING TIMES._”]\r\n\r\nWe spent the night at the “_Anchor_,” a good, large, old inn, with a\r\nfinely-shaven plot of turf and well-kept gravelled walks, and a good\r\nvegetable and fruit garden, with famous gooseberry and apple bushes\r\n(apples on dwarf stocks), in the rear. The landlord, a bluff, stout,\r\nold man, a little while ago brought us in samples of five different\r\nsorts of malt liquor that he had in his cellar. They vary in strength\r\nin the proportions from 8 to 32, and somewhat more in price.\r\n\r\nBefore the railways, thirty-two four-horse coaches stopped at this\r\nhouse daily, besides post-coaches, which, when the fleet was about to\r\nsail from Portsmouth, passed through the village “like a procession.”\r\nHe then kept 100 horses, and had usually ten postboys to breakfast,\r\nthat had been left during the night. Now, there was but one coach and\r\none van that passed through the town.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n                                                            _June 21st._\r\n\r\nNear Liphook, instead of the broad, bleak chalk-downs, with their\r\neven surface of spare green grass, we find extensive tracts of a most\r\nsterile, brown, dry, sandy land, sometimes boggy, (moory,) producing\r\neven more scanty pasturage than the downs, but with scattered tufts\r\nof heath or ling. Most of this is in _commons_, and a few lean sheep,\r\ndonkeys, and starveling ponies are earnestly occupied in seeking for\r\nsomething to eat upon it. Very little of it, for miles that we have\r\npassed over, is enclosed or improved, except that there are extensive\r\nplantations of trees. Timber grows slowly upon it; but the shade of\r\nthe foliage and the decay of leaves so improves the soil that it is\r\nworth cultivating after its removal. It is also improved so as to bear\r\ntolerable crops, by paring and burning and sheep-folding—as described\r\non the downs of Wiltshire.\r\n\r\nWe had walked half-a-dozen miles this morning, when I discovered I had\r\nlost my watch, and turned back. When about three miles from Liphook,\r\nI met our landlord of “_The Anchor_.” He had found the watch in my\r\nroom, and immediately mounted a horse, and rode hard to overtake us.\r\nHe refused any compensation, unless it were “a glass of grog to drink\r\nmy health.” I had happened to show him one of those villainous Spanish\r\nquarters that so successfully hold their place against our legitimate\r\ncurrency, which I had had left in my pocket on leaving New York, and he\r\nsaid, if I didn’t value it, he would be glad to take it as a _keepsake_\r\nof us. I have no doubt he will always remember us as the three\r\ngentlemen that had the good taste not to go from Portsmouth to London\r\nby “the infernal railways.”\r\n\r\nIt was a day of thick, rapidly-passing clouds, and in a part of my\r\nwalk, which was through a well-wooded, rolling country with very steep\r\nhill-sides and deep narrow valleys, I saw some most charming effects\r\nof broad shadows, chasing over waving foliage, with angel-flights\r\nof sunshine, often disclosing long, narrow vistas of distant, deep\r\nglens, or glances of still water, becalmed and warm under high,\r\ndark, quivering, leafy bluffs. But the greater part of this country\r\n(but a day’s walk from London) is the most dreary, desolate,\r\nGod-forsaken-looking land that I ever saw or imagined. Hills and dales,\r\npicturesque enough in form, high, deep, and broad; all brown, gray,\r\nand black; sterile, parched, uninhabited—dead: the only sign of life\r\nor vegetation a little crisp moss, or singed, prostrate, despairing\r\nling—seeming exactly as if an intense fire had not long since swept\r\nover it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _A HIGHWAY ADVENTURE._]\r\n\r\nSuch was the whole dreary landscape, far and near—only this “blasted\r\nheath.” A great black squall-cloud had for some time thrown additional\r\ngloom—a new intensity of gloom—over it; and I was walking slowly, in\r\nbereavement of all sympathizing life in this sepulchral ground of\r\nNature, when my eye fell upon a block of stone, bearing inscription—“In\r\ndetestation of the murder of a sailor on this spot by [three persons\r\nwhose names are given], who were hung near here. ‘Whoso sheddeth man’s\r\nblood, by man shall his blood be shed.’ _Look on the other side._”\r\n\r\nI was still half kneeling and musing before this monument, when I heard\r\nmyself gruffly addressed, “Wull tell me what’s the time o’ day?”\r\n\r\nWithout rising, I turned my head and saw over my shoulder a tall,\r\nheavily-whiskered, ruffianly-faced fellow, half sportsman, half sailor\r\nin dress, carrying a stout stick and a bundle in a handkerchief. How\r\ndid he get there? I must have seen him before if he had come either\r\nway by the road; he must have approached from over the hill behind me,\r\nand that cautiously; apparently he had been concealed there. I confess\r\nthat I wished for a moment that I had in “my interior reservoirs a\r\nsufficient Birmingham horse-pistol,” wherewith to make myself alike\r\ntall with him if he should give me need; but, still bending over\r\nthe memorial of murder, I drew my watch and answered him civilly,\r\nwhereupon, without even a “growl,” he “sidled off,” and soon passed\r\nfrom my sight. My friends had seen the same man, in company with\r\nanother, near the same place, an hour and a-half before.\r\n\r\nOn “the other side”—oh, human vanity!—was the name of the man who had\r\ncaused the stone to be placed there. Posterity is requested to remember\r\nthe murderers and the murdered, and especially not to forget the\r\n_detester_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\n       LONDON LADS.—RAILWAY RIDE.—OBSERVATIONS IN NATURAL HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt half-past five, having overtaken my friends and dined at Godalming,\r\nI took seat with them in the third-class carriages of a train bound to\r\nLondon, intending, however, only to take a lift so that we might walk\r\nin before dark.\r\n\r\nThe carriages were nearly empty, till, stopping at a way-station,\r\nthey were suddenly and with boisterous merry haste taken possession\r\nof, filled full and over-filled with a class of people differing in\r\ntheir countenances, manners, language, and tone of voice from any we\r\nhad before seen in England. They were more like New York _b’hoys_, a\r\nlittle less rowdy and a shade more vulgar. “London lads,” one of them\r\nvery civilly told me they were, employed in a factory out here in\r\nthe country, and having just received their week’s wages were going\r\nin to spend them. They were pale, and many effeminate, in features,\r\nrather oily and grimy, probably from their employment; talked loudly\r\nand rapidly, using many cant words, and often addressing those at a\r\ndistance by familiar, abbreviated names; lively, keen, quick-eyed,\r\nwith a peculiarly fearless, straightforward, uneducated way of\r\nmaking original remarks, that showed considerable wit and powers of\r\nobservation; rough, turbulent, and profane, yet using a good many\r\npolite forms, and courteous enough in action.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE LONDON B’HOYS._]\r\n\r\nTwo or three men, as soon as the train was in motion, held up each\r\na brace or two of rabbits, at which there was cheering and laughter\r\nfrom the rest. All, indeed, were in the greatest possible good humour,\r\njoking and bantering and making engagements, or telling of their\r\nplans for dining together, or meeting for some degrading excitement\r\non Sunday. Of us and others in the car, when they entered, they took\r\nlittle notice, though treating us with respect in not jostling or\r\ncrowding us; but as soon as they were well settled in their places\r\nthey began to make game of one another; to tell stories, evidently\r\nimprovising comical anecdotes of their employers and other common\r\nacquaintances, both absent and present. A dignified “old chap,”\r\nwho stood near upon the platform, was made very uncomfortable, and\r\nreduced considerably in height and stiffness, by urgent invitations to\r\njoin them. The “guard,” too, was made an especial butt, and several\r\nillustrations were given of the ignorant character of railway-people in\r\ngeneral. “There vas von them Mefodis wisitin-coves, you know, wot ’awks\r\ntracs and suchlike, in here a Vensdy wen we come up; and ven the guard\r\ncome along he arks him did he know the Lord’s prayer? ‘Lorspraer?’ says\r\nhe, ‘vot is he?’ says he; ‘is he a _stoker_ or a _driver_?’ says he,\r\nha! ha! ha! I’m blowed ’f ’e didn’t.”\r\n\r\n“I saw one of them same fellows other night,” continued another, “wot\r\n’ad ’old of another on ’em. He treats ’im to a go o’ gin first, you\r\nsee, to make him sharp like, and then he axes him did he know any\r\nthink about the eternal world. ‘’Turnulwool?’ says he—‘’Turnulwool?—no\r\nsuch place in the Farnham branch, sir—hadn’t you best enkvire of the\r\nstation-master, sir?’ says he.”\r\n\r\n“’Ternal world’s the place where they hadn’t got the rails down to\r\nyet—last adwices; aren’t it?—and they carries the nobs on there with\r\nlays o’ busses wot runs erry day in the year oney Sunneys and her\r\nMajestee’s birth-day.”\r\n\r\n“No, no; I’ll tell you where ’tis—tarnal world—it’s the kentry what\r\nthe coves in Astraly cuts to wen the Kangarwoos gets short and the\r\ngin-trees gives out and they’s ’ard up.”\r\n\r\n“Kangurerhoos—what’s them?”\r\n\r\n“Kind of fish as is covered with feathers ’stead o’ scales.”\r\n\r\n“I know it—fact I tell you, ’pon my honour—needn’t laugh—I see a sailor\r\nas ’ad a vestcoat made on’t, short vethers like spangled welwet, black\r\nand goold, regular ’ristocratic—stunnenest thing you ever see.”\r\n\r\n“Well, what’s a gin-tree?—that bangs me.”\r\n\r\n“I know—there is—a big tree wot runs gin wen yer tap her—and there’s a\r\nbread-tree, too——”\r\n\r\n“What bears fresh kortern loavs erry morning.”\r\n\r\n“Hurray for Polytechny!

Vy the trees is werry\r\n’igh and the buttered side’s the lightest to be sure.”\r\n\r\n“Hi! that’s the place for this chile—I’m bound to—‘over the seas for to\r\ngo’—_only_ waitin’ for an act of Parliament, and wen I get there—_hi!\r\nBuffalo gals!_”——\r\n\r\n“When he gets there you know what he’ll do? When he comes to the gin\r\ntrees he’ll treat the company. First time in his life. Ha! ha!”\r\n\r\nAnd with such constantly combining streams a flood of original\r\ninformation and entertainment was poured out to us until we reached the\r\nlittle station about nine miles out of London, to which we had taken\r\ntickets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nRURAL LABOURERS NEAR LONDON.—OUR MOTHER\r\nTONGUE.—COCKNEYS.—PROVINCIALISTS.—ON THE NATURALIZATION OF FOREIGN\r\nWORDS.—AUTHORITIES.—SUBURBAN LONDON.—LONDON.—THE THAMES.—“SAINT\r\nPAUL’S FROM BLACKFRIAR’S BRIDGE.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _WALK TO LONDON._]\r\n\r\nUpon our asking directions, a gentleman who left the first-class\r\ncarriage offered to be our guide for a little way. He led us between\r\nfields in which some men were hay-making. We spoke of the “London\r\nlads” we had been riding with, and the gentleman agreed with us that,\r\nwicked as they might appear, they were less degraded than the mass of\r\nagricultural labourers.\r\n\r\n“We could not stop to rest here on the stile,” said he, “but that\r\nevery single man in that field, in the course of five minutes, would\r\ncome to us to ask something for drink; and the worst of it is, it is\r\nnot an excuse to obtain money by indirect begging for the support of\r\ntheir families, but they would actually spend it immediately at the\r\npublic-house.”\r\n\r\nWe told him we had never been in London, and after a little\r\nconversation he said that he had been trying to discover where we\r\ncame from, as from our accent he should have thought us Londoners. He\r\nhad thought that he could always tell from what part of England any\r\nstranger in London came, but he could not detect any of the provincial\r\naccents or idioms in our language. We told him that we had supposed the\r\ncockney dialect was quite distinct, but certainly never imagined it\r\nat all like our own. On the contrary, he said, except among the vulgar\r\nclasses, the Londoner alone has no dialect, but, much more than the\r\nnative of any other part of England, speaks our language from infancy\r\nin its purity, and with the accent generally approved by our most\r\nelegant orators and generally acknowledged authorities.\r\n\r\n“But a liberal education must remove provincialisms, both of idiom and\r\naccent.”\r\n\r\n“In a degree only. A boy will generally retain a good deal of his\r\nprovincial accent through the public school and university. At least,\r\nI have paid considerable attention to the matter, and I think I am\r\nalways able to detect it, and say with confidence in which quarter of\r\nthe kingdom a man spent his youth. You would yourself probably have no\r\ndifficulty in detecting a Scotchman.”\r\n\r\n“I have noticed that Scotchmen who have resided long in England, and\r\nwho had in a considerable degree lost their original peculiarities,\r\nusually spoke in a disagreeably high key and with great exactness and\r\ndistinctness of utterance.”\r\n\r\n“That is the result of the original effort which it was necessary for\r\nthem to use to speak correctly. They speak from the book, as it were,\r\nand the same is more or less noticeable in all provincialists who do\r\nnot habitually speak with the accent of their youth.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _WORDS AND THEIR AUTHORITIES._]\r\n\r\nWe then informed him that we were Americans, which much surprised him.\r\nI somewhat doubt myself the correctness of his observation. I am aware\r\nof habitually using many _Yankeeisms_ myself, and have no desire to\r\navoid them. The New England accent of words, except such as are not\r\nvery commonly used, I should think might be generally agreeable to the\r\nmost approved standards in England. The educated English certainly\r\nspeak with much greater distinctness and more elegance than we commonly\r\ndo; perhaps they generally err in being too precise and methodical,\r\nand it may be that the Londoners converse with more rapidity and\r\nease, or carelessness, than others. That what are shown to us as\r\npeculiarities of cockney dialect are mere vulgarisms and slang, not\r\naltogether peculiar to the metropolis, is very true.\r\n\r\nAgreeably to Walker, the educated English often give the sound of\r\n_a_ to _e_, pronouncing Derby, _Darby_; clerk, _clark_, &c. This at\r\nfirst seemed very odd; but when I returned home, our own way had\r\nbecome foreign to me. Vase is universally _vawze_ or _vaze_; route,\r\n_rute_. With us, except in society which has a more than ordinary\r\nEuropean element, these, and some other foreign words in common\r\nuse, are Anglicized; and though when one is accustomed to the more\r\npolite sound there may seem an affectation of simplicity in this, I\r\ncannot but wish that the custom was more general. The French almost\r\nuniversally adapt foreign words of which they have need for common\r\nuse to the requirements of their habitual tongue, changing not only\r\nthe pronunciation but the _spelling_: they write _rosbif_ for the old\r\nEnglish roast beef, _biftek_ for beef-steak. So we write and pronounce\r\n_cotelette_ cutlet; why need we say “angtremay” for _entremets_? or if\r\nwe choose that sound, and like it also better than “_side-dishes_,” why\r\nnot print it “angtremay?” We write Cologne for Köln; why not Leeong\r\nfor Lyons? or if Lyons, let us also speak it Lyons, and consider\r\nLeeong an affectation except when we speak it in connection with other\r\nplainly French words. The only rule with regard to such matters is, to\r\nfollow custom. Singularity is impertinent where it can be gracefully\r\navoided; but as there is more tendency to Anglicize foreign words that\r\nare in general use in America than in England, and this is a good and\r\nsensible tendency, let us not look for our rules to English custom.\r\nLet us read _Venus de Medicis_ Venus de Medicis, rather than stammer\r\nand blush over it because we are not perfect in Italian. I once heard\r\na clergyman call it “Venu-de-Medisy:” two-thirds of his congregation\r\nunderstood what he meant as well as if he had given it the true\r\nItalian pronunciation; but if he had read it with the sound they would\r\nnaturally attach in English reading to that connection of letters,\r\nnearly all would have known what he meant, and no one would have had a\r\nreasonable occasion to laugh at him. But why is not our own language\r\nfit to speak of it in—the Medicean Venus? Why should the French word\r\nenvelope be used by us when we have the English _envelop_? Why the\r\nItalian _chiaro-oscuro_, when there is the English clare-obscure\r\nexpressing the same? I am glad to see some of our railroad companies\r\naccepting the word _station_, which is good old English, in place of\r\nthe word _depot_, which, as we pronounce it, is neither French nor\r\nEnglish. In England, the designation _station_ is invariable. _Depot_\r\nis only used as a military technicality, with the French pronunciation,\r\n_dapo_. If we really want a foreign word or phrase to express\r\nourselves, it shows a deficiency in our language. Supply this by making\r\nyour foreigner English: we in America must not be chary of admitting\r\nstrangers. Naturalize it as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nNeither let us think it of great consequence whether we say _Rush-an_\r\nor _Ru-shan_ for Russian; _trawf_ or _truf_ (as usual in England)\r\nfor trough; _def_ or _deef_ for deaf; or whether we spell according\r\nto Johnson, or Walker, or Webster, (or Webster modified;) the custom\r\nvaries, not only between England and America, but between elegant\r\nscholars of each country in itself. The man is impudent who condemns\r\nme, let me speak or write almost how I may, for I always have some\r\ngiant to back me.\r\n\r\n                   *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _SUBURBAN LONDON._]\r\n\r\nHalf-a-mile’s walk brought us to a village of plain, low, detached,\r\npaltry shops, where our guide, having given us a very simple direction,\r\ntook leave of us. We followed up the broad street; the shops, a large\r\nnumber of which were ale-houses, soon were displaced in a great measure\r\nby plain, small villas, of stone, or stuccoed brick, standing two or\r\nthree rods back from the street, with dense shrubbery, enclosed by\r\n_high brick walls_ before them. Gradually the houses ran together\r\nand became blocks; omnibuses, market-carts, heavy _vans_, (covered\r\nluggage-wagons,) and pleasure-carriages, constantly met and passed, and\r\nwhen we had walked about three miles, the village had become a compact,\r\nbusy town—strangely interrupted once by a large, wild, wholly rustic\r\n_common_. Then the town again: the side-walk encroached upon by the\r\ngrocers and hucksters; monster signs of “entire” ales and ready-made\r\ncoffins, and “great sacrifices” of haberdashery and ladies’ goods; the\r\nstreet wide and admirably paved, and crossed at short but irregular\r\nintervals by other narrower streets, and growing more busy every\r\nmoment. Still it is nothing remarkable; a wide street, plain brick\r\nhouses, a smell of gas now and then, and a crowd. I would hardly have\r\nknown, from any thing to be seen, that I was not entering some large\r\ntown in our country, that I had never visited before. Indeed, it’s\r\nquite like coming down the Bowery.\r\n\r\nPeople were looking up; following the direction of their eyes, we\r\nsaw a balloon ascending. The air was calm, and it rose to a great\r\nheight—greater, says the Times this morning, than any ever reached\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nA shrill cry in the distance, rising faintly above the rumble\r\nof the wheels, and hum and patter of the side-walks, grows\r\nrapidly more distinct, until we distinguish, sung in a high key,\r\n“_Strawberrie—Sixpenny-pottle. Who’ll buy?_” The first of “London\r\ncries.”\r\n\r\nWe have been walking steadily, in a nearly straight line, for two\r\nhours, and now the crowd thickens rapidly until it is for a moment\r\nat full tide of Broadway density. There is a long break in the brick\r\nhouse-fronts, and we forge aside out of the crowd and halt to take an\r\nobservation. We are leaning over the parapet of _Blackfriar’s Bridge_.\r\nThe Thames looks much as I had supposed; something wider than our\r\ntravellers like to represent it, hardly an “insignificant stream” even\r\nto an eye accustomed to American rivers, but wide enough and deep\r\nenough and strong enough to make bridges of magnificence necessary to\r\ncross it, and answering all the requirements needed in a ship-canal\r\npassing through the midst of a vast town. A strong current setting\r\nupward from the sea gurgles under the arches; heavy coal-barges slowly\r\nsweep along with it; dancing, needle-like wherries shoot lightly across\r\nit, and numerous small, narrow steamboats, crowded with passengers,\r\nplough white furrows up and down its dark surface.\r\n\r\nUpon the bank opposite—almost upon the bank, and not distant in an\r\nartist’s haze—stand blackened walls and a noble old dome, familiar to\r\nus from childhood. It is only nearer, blacker, and smaller—wofully\r\nsmaller—than it has always been. We do not even think of telling each\r\nother it is SAINT PAUL’S.\r\n\r\nThere is a low darkness, and the houses and all are sooty in streaks,\r\nbut there is a pure—so far as our lungs and noses know—pure, fresh,\r\ncool breeze sweeping up the river, and overhead a cloudless sky;\r\nand in the clear ether, clear as Cincinnati’s, there is a new\r\nsatellite—beautiful, beautiful as the moon’s young daughter. It is\r\nthe balloon, now so high that the car is invisible, and without any\r\nperceptible motion it blushes in golden sunlight,—while we have been\r\nsome time since left to evening’s dusk.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: “_MOVE ON!_”]\r\n\r\n“_Move on!_ move on, if you please, gentlemen,” says a policeman. The\r\ncrowd tramps hastily behind us. We turn and are sucked into the motley\r\nchannel, which soon throws us out from the bridge upon a very broad\r\nstreet; up this, in a slackening tide, we are still unresistingly\r\ncarried, for it is London, and that was what we were looking for; and\r\nfor a while we allow ourselves to be absorbed in it without asking what\r\nis to become of us next.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              APPENDIX C.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFORMATION AND ADVICE FOR THOSE WISHING TO MAKE A PEDESTRIAN TOUR IN\r\nENGLAND, AT THE LEAST PRACTICABLE EXPENSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nA young man with small means, and who is willing to “rough it,” wishes\r\nto know with how low a sum of money it would be practicable for him to\r\nundertake a trip to England. I have no doubt there are many such who\r\nwould visit the Old World if they were aware how cheaply and pleasantly\r\nthey could do so. I have heretofore expressed my own obligation to\r\nBayard Taylor, and it is probable that what I shall have to say will\r\nbe, to some extent, a repetition of the instructions given in a chapter\r\nupon the subject in the later editions of the “Views Afoot.” It will,\r\nhowever, have more especial reference to travelling on foot in England.\r\n\r\n_The Passage._—There are no regular arrangements made in the\r\npacket-ships for those who wish to go to England decently and in\r\ntolerable comfort at a moderate price. It will be with more or less\r\ndifficulty, according as _freights_ are active or dull, that you may\r\nobtain a proper “second cabin passage and _found_.” You stand the best\r\nchance to do so in the London lines. A special arrangement with the\r\nCaptain is necessary. A party of three or four may at almost any time,\r\nby application to the Captain shortly before a ship sails, engage a\r\nstate-room, provide themselves with stores,[17] and hire their cooking\r\ndone, &c.; so that the passage shall cost them but from twenty to\r\nthirty dollars. With good messmates, good catering, a liberal gratuity\r\nto the cook, steward, or ship’s servant that waits upon you, and\r\nin a _clean_ ship, you may make the passage so, more agreeably than\r\nin any other way; more so than in the first cabin at four times the\r\nexpense. The price of the regular first-cabin passage out is $90. _In\r\nthe steerage_, you pay $10 to $12 for a mere sleeping-place, provide\r\nyourself with stores, cook for yourself, or hire some fellow-passenger,\r\nwho does not suffer equally from sea-sickness, to cook for you. You\r\nmust provide yourself with bedding, cooking utensils, &c. It will\r\ncost you about $20. Secure, if possible, an _upper_ berth, near the\r\nhatchway; be provided with an abundance of old clothes; look out for\r\npilferers; spend an hour each morning in sweeping and keeping clean the\r\nsteerage; nurse the sick; take care of the women and children; and keep\r\nthe deck all the time that you otherwise can. You will probably have a\r\nvery miserable time, but it will be over after a while, and you will\r\nhave seen a peculiar and memorable exhibition of human nature, and will\r\ngo ashore with a pleasure not to be imagined. You can go to Liverpool\r\nor Glasgow by the screw-steamers, (second cabin and found,) decently\r\nand quickly, for from $50 to $75. The same by the mail-steamers, not so\r\ncomfortably, but more quickly. Most disagreeably, but soon over with,\r\nin the steerage of some of the steamers for $40.\r\n\r\n[17] See “Walks and Talks,” Vol. I. p. 21, and consult the ship’s cook\r\nor steward.\r\n\r\n_Returning._—You have the same (and rather increased second-cabin\r\naccommodations by the London packets), at about 10 _per cent._ higher\r\nprices. You can live comfortably for two months, and see “the lions” in\r\nParis or London, for the difference between the first and second-cabin\r\nfare out and home.\r\n\r\nOur _Expenses for board and bed_, while in the country in England,\r\naveraged seventy-five cents a-day. Expenses of short conveyance by\r\nrail, coach, and boat; fees to showmen and guides; washing, postage,\r\nand incidentals, (properly included as travelling expenses,) added to\r\nthis, made our average expenses about one dollar a-day each. How we\r\nfared, and with what degree of comfort or luxury we were content, the\r\nreader should have already been informed. I have, however, dwelt more\r\nupon the agreeable than the disagreeable side of such travelling. We\r\noften, on entering a town, looked from one inn to another, in doubt\r\nwhich to select, desiring to avoid unnecessary expense, while we\r\nsecured quiet and cleanliness. Sometimes we would enter a house and\r\nask to see the rooms and know the charges. No offence was ever taken\r\nat this, though once or twice, where we were going to spend a Sunday,\r\nand the rooms were not agreeable, or convenient to write in, we\r\nproceeded further. We soon, however, were able to guess very well the\r\ncharacter of a house by its outside appearance, and could regulate our\r\ndisbursements with great exactness.\r\n\r\n_Inns._—The great difference between the large “first-class” inns and\r\nthe second and third class is, that in the latter the lodgers are so\r\nfew that one or two servants can take the place of three or four at\r\nthe former. Frequently the landlord may be porter and Boots, (and will\r\nact as _commissionaire_ or _cicerone_;) the mistress, cook; and their\r\ndaughter, waiter and chambermaid, &c. In such cases, generally, no\r\nservants’ fees at all are expected, and at most a third or half of what\r\nis honestly due the servants of the stylish inn will be satisfactory.\r\nThe small inns are really often more comfortable to the pedestrian than\r\nthe large ones; because he can be more at his ease; need not care how\r\nhe appears; can wheel the sofa up to the fire or open all the windows;\r\ndine in his slippers, and smoke, if he likes, in the parlour: take\r\ncommand of the house, in short; see for himself that his shoes are\r\ngreased and his linen washed and drying, his knapsack-straps repaired,\r\nlost buttons replaced, and all his rig a-taunto for an early start\r\nwithout delays in the morning.\r\n\r\nIf you call for any thing for your table that the house is not\r\nprovided with, it will be at once procured from the shops; the cooking\r\nis generally good, and the bread always fine. We usually contented\r\nourselves with one hot meal in a day. Two of us were without the habit\r\nof drinking tea or coffee, and would often make our breakfast of bread\r\nand milk; lunch on bread and cheese and beer, and take a substantial\r\nmeal at the end of our day’s walk. We thought we walked better with\r\nthis arrangement than any other.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ADVICE TO THE PEDESTRIAN._]\r\n\r\nFor _less than seventy cents a-day_ it is possible to travel in England\r\nwithout hardship or injury to health. For how much less I cannot say.\r\nI once stopped alone at a house where I dined with the family on\r\nboiled bacon and potatoes and a bag-pudding, for which I was charged\r\nsixpence; breakfasted on scalded milk and bread for twopence; and was\r\nasked sixpence _in advance_ for lodging. I had a good, clean bed and\r\nwashing conveniences in my room. Add to this twopence for tea, and the\r\nday’s living is 33 cents. This was in the north of England, and was\r\nextraordinary. The usual charge for lodging is a shilling, sometimes\r\nninepence, and sometimes only sixpence. At the first-class inns they\r\nwill make you pay well in one way or another. Where we did not dine we\r\nhave been charged threepence each for the use of the public room, that\r\nis to say, for sitting in it instead of out-of-doors or in our rooms,\r\nwhile waiting for tea to be prepared. With regard to servants, the best\r\nway is to ask the landlord to pay them and charge it in the bill. It\r\nrelieves you of a great annoyance, and in such cases we never found the\r\ncharge added extravagant.\r\n\r\n_Equipment._—_Shoes_ can be obtained much cheaper in England than\r\nAmerica, and, indeed, first-rate shoes are hardly to be had in America;\r\nbut English shoes, that you would have to buy at the shops, always have\r\na seam across the instep that is very hard upon a foot unaccustomed\r\nto it; and for this reason, and to ensure a shape to suit you, you\r\nhad best get them made at home. The leather should be well-tanned and\r\ndressed thick kip or cowhide, the best that can be procured; the soles\r\nof “English bend,” three-eighths of an inch in thickness; double this\r\nin the heel, which should come so far forward that the break will\r\nbe perpendicular with the point of the ankle. Give your order, if\r\npossible, six months beforehand, (I never have known a shoemaker who\r\nwould get his work done when he promised to for any consideration,)\r\nand go to the _workman_ yourself to make sure that he understands what\r\nyou want, otherwise you will probably receive, just as you are going\r\non board ship, a parcel by express containing a pair of butterfly\r\npumps with soles of hummingbird hide. Have a distinct agreement that\r\nthey shall be returned if they do not come in time, and if they do\r\nnot answer to your order. They should be high enough (6½ inches,\r\nincluding heel, commonly) to well cover the ankle, and lace up with\r\nbut two crossings over the instep. The laces must be made of the best\r\n_leather_, and you should carry half-a-dozen spare ones.\r\n\r\nIf, finally, the shoes are not large enough to go easily over two\r\nwoollen socks on your foot, reject them. Get Shaker _woollen socks_ of\r\nan exact fit to your foot, or as large as they may be without danger\r\nof folding or rubbing into welts under your shoes. Wear them with the\r\n“wrong side” outward. You do not want to wear them double, but your\r\nfeet will swell so in a long hot day’s walk, that you will want that\r\nthere should have been room enough in your shoes for them to be double\r\nbefore you started. Break your shoes in on the passage.\r\n\r\nGaiters are worn to protect the feet from dust and gravel coming over\r\nthe top of the shoe. They increase the heat of the feet to that degree\r\nthat they are best dispensed with. Bathe your feet at every convenient\r\nopportunity on the road, and always as soon as you stop for the night,\r\nand change your socks and put on slippers.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ADVICE TO THE PEDESTRIAN._]\r\n\r\nI could give good reasons for all that I have recommended with regard\r\nto shoes; and you had better neglect nothing. I took all these\r\nprecautions and yet suffered a thousand times more, and was delayed\r\nmore, from foot-soreness than from fatigue. English pedestrians and\r\nsportsmen often wear much heavier and clumsier shoes than I have\r\nadvised.\r\n\r\n_Knapsack._—We had the India-rubber _army_ knapsack, made at Naugatuck,\r\nConnecticut. If you can get them well “seasoned,” so that they will not\r\nstick or smell, and with a good _harness_, they will probably be the\r\nbest you can procure. Ours were so, and we found them convenient and to\r\nwear well.\r\n\r\n_Clothing_ you can get in England better than at home, if you wish to\r\nbuy any. You must dispense with every thing not absolutely essential to\r\nyour comfort; for every ounce is felt in a hot day. We carried in our\r\nknapsacks each about as follows:\r\n\r\nFour shirts, 1 pair cloth pantaloons, 2 pair socks, slippers,\r\nhandkerchiefs, mending materials, toilet articles, coarse towel,\r\nnapkin, leather drinking-cup, cap, oil-silk cape, portfolio with\r\nwriting and sketching materials, knife and fork, candle of tallow (that\r\nit may be used to grease shoes with upon occasion), matches, a book,\r\nmap, pocket-compass, adhesive plaster, cord, shoe-lacings.\r\n\r\nEvery thing selected with great care for lightness and compactness,\r\nand the whole weighing ten pounds and a-half, including knapsack and\r\nstraps. We wore upon the road light cloth coats and waistcoats, and\r\nlinen dusters or blouses, and light cassimere pantaloons. We each\r\ncarried a strong, hooked hickory-stick, and it will be found best to\r\ndo so. We usually wore broad-brimmed, pliable felt hats of the best\r\nquality; they were excellent both in sun and rain. We also had light\r\nlinen caps.\r\n\r\nFor _rainy weather_ a cape of the best black oiled silk, 22 inches\r\nlong before, and 16 inches behind, with a low collar, and buttoning\r\nin front, weighing half-a-pound, and folding so small that it could\r\nbe carried in a coat pocket—a most capital and serviceable article.\r\nWith a loop and a tape it may be gathered tight at the waist under the\r\nknapsack, so as not to be lifted by the wind.\r\n\r\nA _flask for drink_ is hardly worth its carriage in England. A man\r\nevery way in health should be able to walk a dozen miles or more\r\nwithout wanting to drink. Where good water is constantly to be had, it\r\nis refreshing to taste it very frequently, and there are no ill effects\r\nto be apprehended from doing so. You will perspire more freely, and I\r\nthink stand the heat better; but cold water will not quench thirst,\r\nexcept momentarily; on the contrary, I believe it increases it. Malt\r\nliquors and spirituous liquors have different effects upon different\r\nindividuals. Both are disagreeable to me. Most English pedestrians\r\ndrink very freely of malt liquors, and find them very wholesome. On\r\nthe Continent I would carry a flask for light wine, such as every\r\npeasant has to his dinner. Its cost is trifling, and there is nothing\r\nin the world which will quench thirst like it, except, perhaps, tea.\r\nIt is not very palatable at first, but exceedingly refreshing, and I\r\nbelieve every way healthful. It has no intoxicating, and very slight\r\nstimulating, qualities. I think it would be a great moral blessing, and\r\nhave an excellent effect on the public health, if it could be produced\r\ncheaply, and used as freely as tea and coffee now are in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nHere I will give you “a secret,” which may, some time, be of use to\r\nyou. When you feel very much jaded with a long walk, and hardly able to\r\ngo any further, if you can swallow a cup of tea and a bit of toast or\r\nbiscuit, and _pour a wine-glass of whiskey into your shoes_, keeping\r\nyourself warm during the halt, you will find yourself good for another\r\nhour or two of hard tramping.\r\n\r\n_Routes and Distances._—Unless you are considerably familiar with the\r\nlanguage and history of a Continental nation, I would advise you to\r\nspend most of your time in England. It is better to study thoroughly\r\nthe character of one people, and remain so long, if possible, in their\r\ncountry, that you may feel as if you had lived in it, and made yourself\r\na part of it, than to run superficially over a dozen. It is, however,\r\nmuch cheaper, and in many respects more agreeable, to walk in Germany\r\nthan in England; and a true American, mingling with the peasant people,\r\ncan hardly fail to do them good, and have his own heart enlightened and\r\nexpanded by their spirit longing for liberty and universal affection\r\nfor his country. It is of walking in England, however, that I wish now\r\nespecially to speak.\r\n\r\nYour route should be determined by your tastes and objects. If they are\r\nas general as ours, and you design to employ the same time in England\r\nthat we did, I could advise but very slight variation from our route.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _ADVICE TO THE PEDESTRIAN._]\r\n\r\nWith a week’s more time, you should see more of North Wales, (though,\r\nin general, mountain and lake country _is not England_, and you can\r\nget what tourists go to those districts for better nearer home;)\r\nextend your walk into Devonshire, and keep along the south coast to\r\nPortsmouth. After visiting the Isle of Wight, the old road to London,\r\nrunning, I believe, through Guildford, is said to be much pleasanter\r\nthan the more direct way we came. After spending some weeks in and\r\nabout London, follow up the Thames by Henley, and as near the south\r\nbank as you can, to Oxford—then by Stratford-on-Avon, Warwick, and\r\nKenilworth, to Birmingham; thence, according to your interest, through\r\nthe manufacturing districts, and by Chatsworth and the Derbyshire moors\r\nto York; thence by Fountain’s Abbey, through the curious hill-country\r\nof West Yorkshire and Lancashire, into Westmoreland; thence either\r\nnorth to Scotland, or by Liverpool to Ireland, crossing afterwards\r\nto Scotland from Belfast. Guide-books can be obtained, I believe, of\r\nMr. Putnam, in New York, by the aid of which and a good map, you may,\r\nbefore you leave home, judge how much time you will want to spend in\r\nexamining various objects of interest, and ascertain distances, &c.\r\nYou can thus plot off your route and calculate the time at which you\r\nwill arrive at any particular point. Guide-books are very expensive and\r\nheavy, and this is their principal use; further, you are liable to pass\r\nthrough a town and neglect to see something for which it is peculiarly\r\ndistinguished, without you have something to remind you of it.\r\n\r\nWe travelled at first at the rate of one hundred miles in six days, at\r\nlast at the rate of about two hundred; sometimes going forty miles,\r\nand ordinarily thirty, in a day. We usually did thirty miles in eleven\r\nhours, one of which might be spent in _nooning_ under a hedge or in a\r\nwayside inn, and about one mile an hour lost in loitering; looking at\r\nthings on the wayside or talking to people that we met, our actual pace\r\nwas just about four miles an hour.\r\n\r\nYou can start with twelve miles in a day, and calculate to average\r\ntwenty-five after the first fortnight.\r\n\r\nIf you can make any thing like a harmonious noise upon any instrument,\r\nfor that purpose I would advise you to strap it on. You will understand\r\nits value by reading the life of Goldsmith. It will make you welcome\r\nin many a peasant circle, where you might otherwise have been only a\r\ndamper upon all naturalness and geniality.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              APPENDIX D.\r\n\r\n\r\nPrinciples of the Mark System, framed to mix persuasion with\r\npunishment, and make their effect improving, yet their operation\r\nsevere. By CAPTAIN MACHONOCHIE, R. N., K. H., late superintendent of\r\nthe British penal settlement at Norfolk Island.\r\n\r\n\r\n  “Our present punishments resemble every thing that is most\r\n  deteriorating in ordinary life: and they deteriorate accordingly. If\r\n  we would infuse into them those impulses which, under Providential\r\n  guidance, make other forms of adversity improving, we would make them\r\n  improving also.”\r\n\r\nThe constituent elements in secondary punishment are labour and time.\r\nMen are sentenced to hard _labour_ for a given _time_:—but the time is\r\nhere made to measure the labour,—and the first proposal of the Mark\r\nSystem is, that instead of this the labour be made to measure the\r\ntime. This idea is not peculiar to it. In his letter to Earl Grey the\r\nArchbishop of Dublin uses these words: “The best plan, as it appears to\r\nme, would be, instead of sentencing men to imprisonment for a certain\r\ntime, to sentence them to render a certain amount of labour. A fixed\r\ndaily task may be imposed on them, but with power to exceed this at\r\ntheir own discretion, thereby shortening their period of detention.\r\nThe effect would be, not only that criminals would thus acquire habits\r\nof labour, but of attaching an agreeable idea to labour. By each\r\nadditional step they took on the tread-wheel they would be walking out\r\nof prison—by each additional cut of the spade they would be cutting a\r\nway to return to society.”\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE MARK SYSTEM._]\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to express the direct primary effect of the\r\nsystem in happier or terser terms; and even when thus stated, the\r\nimprovement contemplated on existing practice appears immense. But\r\nmuch more when the ulterior consequences are also considered. By\r\nsubstituting a powerful internal stimulus to exertion for that physical\r\ncoercion which must ever be at best an imperfect external one, while\r\nall necessary bondage and suffering as the consequences of crime\r\nwould be retained, direct “slavery” would be banished from among our\r\nsecondary punishments. The tendencies of our management would be to\r\ngood, whereas those of the existing system are “to evil continually.”\r\nMen would improve under it, instead of becoming worse. And the\r\nadministration of public justice would acquire a place among the\r\nChristian agencies of our land: it is painful to think how far it is at\r\npresent removed in operation from any such character.\r\n\r\nBut another view may be also taken of the question thus involved, not\r\nless interesting. If we look abroad into ordinary life, we cannot but\r\nbe struck with the resemblance which our present forms of secondary\r\npunishment bear to every thing that is in this most enfeebling and\r\ndeteriorating, and how directly opposed they are to those forms of\r\nadversity which, under the influence of Providential wisdom, reform\r\ncharacter and invigorate it. Slavery deteriorates—long seclusion\r\ndeteriorates—every condition, in a word, more or less deteriorates,\r\nwhich leaves no choice of action, requires no virtue but obedience,\r\naffords no stimulus to exertion beyond this, supplies the wants of\r\nnature without effort with a view to them, and restores to prosperity,\r\nthrough lapse of time, without evidence that such restoration is\r\ndeserved. Yet this is our present system of secondary punishment. What\r\nimproves, on the contrary, is a condition of adversity from which\r\nthere is no escape but by continuous effort—which leaves the degree\r\nof that effort much in the individual’s own power, but if he relaxes\r\nhis suffering is deepened and prolonged, and it is only alleviated\r\nand shortened if he struggles manfully—which makes exertion necessary\r\neven to earn daily bread—and something more, prudence, self-command,\r\nvoluntary economy, and the like, to recover prosperity. To this, as\r\nyet, secondary punishment bears no resemblance; but were our sentences\r\nmeasured by labour instead of time,—were they to the performance of\r\ncertain tasks, not to the occupation of a certain time in evading\r\nany,—the approximation might be made indefinitely close.\r\n\r\nLabour being a vague term, the system next proposes that it be\r\nrepresented by marks,—the earning of so many thousands of which, in\r\na prison or penal settlement, as the case may be, to be made the\r\npunishment of all offences according to their degree. A proportion\r\nof these marks to be credited to individuals daily, according to the\r\nexertion made in whatever labour is allotted them,—all supplies of\r\nfood and clothing to be charged in them,—all misconduct to be punished\r\nby fines in them,—and only the clear balance to be carried to account\r\ntowards liberation. By this means both wages and savings’ banks would\r\nbe introduced into prisons—wages to stimulate labour, and give an\r\ninterest in it, and savings’ banks to give a similar interest to habits\r\nof economy and self-command. To make the resemblance to ordinary\r\nlife still closer, and at the same time promote kindly and social,\r\nas opposed to selfish, feeling, it is further proposed that during a\r\nportion of their entire period of detention criminals be distributed\r\ninto parties or families of six, with common interests and accounts,\r\nrising or falling together, and thus all interested in the good conduct\r\nof each. By this means a strong physical check would be laid on crime\r\nin prisons, with a yet stronger moral one; and an apparatus would be\r\ngained by which good conduct and exertion would be made popular, and\r\noffence unpopular, in the community, and all would be interested in\r\npromoting the one and keeping down the other. My experience on Norfolk\r\nIsland—(which was imperfect, because my views were not then sustained,\r\nas I trust they yet will be, at home, my powers and apparatus were\r\nconsequently imperfect, and my results rather indicated tendencies than\r\ngave precise conclusions) yet leads me to attach great value to this,\r\nas to several other details explained in other papers. But I regard\r\nthem all only as they seem to me to carry out the principles laid down.\r\nIf these are right, when once established, the best details to found on\r\nthem will soon become of themselves apparent. With a near tangible end,\r\nlike individual reform, in view, no mistakes, however at first great,\r\ncan be long persisted in.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: _THE MARK SYSTEM._]\r\n\r\nSeverity, then, with a directly benevolent purpose,—modelled with a\r\nview to recover criminals as well as punish them,—controlled and guided\r\nby the enlightened pursuit of this noble end, made as great, for the\r\nbenefit both of the individual and the community, as is compatible\r\nwith it, but neither greater nor other than strictly subordinate to\r\nit,—this is the guide here sought to be introduced into secondary\r\npunishment: and unless it is attentively considered, it will be found\r\ndifficult to believe the number of new views that it will open up of\r\ninterest and promise. It will adjust the controversy between harshness\r\nand lenity which has long divided reasoners on the subject,—the one\r\nimpulse having authorized the most distressing cruelties, while the\r\nother has occasionally led to indulgences scarcely less injurious\r\nin their ultimate consequences to both the criminal and society,\r\nenfeebling the one, and leading the honest labourer, in the other,\r\npainfully to contrast his own position with that of the convicted\r\nfelon. It will thus solve many preliminary difficulties, and conduct\r\nto many important conclusions. It will give a new spirit to punishment\r\nby giving it a new direction. By raising its object it will raise its\r\nadministration. It will be difficult to be either cruel or careless\r\nwith such an object as individual reform in view, and _while wielding\r\nan agency offering a reasonable probability of attaining it_. (The last\r\nis of great importance: we become indifferent, in spite of ourselves,\r\nwhen engaged in a hopeless task.) It will assimilate this branch of our\r\nadministration to those ways of Providence to men which must always\r\nbe our surest guides when we seek to influence them. It will thus\r\nimitate the highest wisdom, and thereby enable us to obey the highest\r\nprecept. We may love while we chasten, and be substantially kind even\r\nwhen enforcing the strictest commands of punitive law. It will succeed\r\nwith little effort, because it will study the human nature implanted\r\nin us, instead of trampling its impulses under foot. It will further\r\nconduct to great economy as well as efficiency, partly through this\r\ncause, partly because the virtues of industry and self-command which\r\nit will be its great aim to foster will equally bring about both\r\nresults. The practical change may be thought a small one on which to\r\nfound such anticipations—the change from measuring labour by time to\r\nthat of measuring time by labour—or, in other words, from giving our\r\ncriminals time-sentences to allotting them tasks:—but the one course\r\nis the direct reverse of the other, and the difference may be thus\r\nthe whole difference between right and wrong, success and failure. It\r\nseems, indeed, even impossible to follow out the chain of reasoning\r\nsuggested without coming to this conclusion. When men are smitten\r\nwith adversity in ordinary life, and thus _punished_ for previous\r\nfollies or misconduct, they are not condemned to this adversity for a\r\ncertain _time_, but until they can retrieve their position. They suffer\r\nunder this _task_; they sorrow over it (but without resentment); they\r\nstruggle with it; their characters improve under the various efforts\r\nand emotions called out by it, (both deepened if they have others to\r\ncare for as well as themselves;) frequently they rise even higher\r\nthan before;—and society is instructed by such examples in every\r\nway—it shrinks from the preliminary sufferings exhibited in them, and\r\nemulates, in due proportion as its own case may require, the manly\r\nstruggle that has at length overcome them. And so it might be with\r\nour punishments, if we would model them on the same type. They are now\r\nfor the most part barbarous in every sense, in their want of skill\r\nand adaptation to high purpose, and in the crime and misery they thus\r\ngratuitously produce. We might make them beneficent in every sense,\r\nmerely by copying the wisdom that is around us;—and when this is fully\r\nunderstood, it is not to be imagined but that every lover of his kind\r\nwill take even an eager interest in bringing about the change. The real\r\ndifficulty is to influence to the inquiry.\r\n\r\nI must add, that in this condensed statement of the principles of his\r\nsystem, Captain Machonochie has made no allusion to a very important\r\npart of it—the _anti-criminal_ part, if I may so express it. He\r\nproposes, as a preventive measure, the establishment of Industrial\r\nSchools, to which the children of the poorer classes or vagrants should\r\nbe encouraged to come and give their cheerful and active labour, by\r\nreceiving marks exchangeable for a good, substantial, but coarse, meal\r\nin the middle of the day, and some other food to carry home at night.\r\nThe employments to be as much as possible rural and agricultural, and\r\nin every case at least laborious, fitting those subjected to them to\r\nface hard work in after life.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER’S NOTE\r\n\r\nIllustrations in this eBook have been positioned between paragraphs\r\nand outside quotations.\r\n\r\nObvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been corrected\r\nafter careful comparison with other occurrences within the text and\r\nconsultation of external sources.\r\n\r\nSome hyphens in words have been silently removed, some added, when a\r\npredominant preference was found in the original book.\r\n\r\nExcept for those changes noted below, all misspellings in the text, and\r\ninconsistent or archaic usage, have been retained.\r\n\r\n  Pg 87:  “completly” replaced with “completely”\r\n     94:  “dormar” replaced with “dormer”\r\n    130:  “alledging” replaced with “alleging”\r\n    131:  “Englis” replaced with “English”\r\n    164:  “advantagious” replaced with “advantageous”",
