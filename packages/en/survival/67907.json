B. ROBINSON\r\n\r\n  LONDON: T. C. & E. C. JACK\r\n  NEW YORK: E. P. DUTTON & CO.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  TO\r\n\r\n  ALEC CORSE SCOTT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY DEAR ALEC,\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Defoe wrote Robinson Crusoe, nearly two hundred years ago, boys\r\nhad more time on their hands, fewer books and fewer games than they\r\nhave now, and they, as well as their fathers, read it and loved it. And\r\nwhen your father and I were boys--though that is rather less than two\r\nhundred years ago--we too used often to read it.\r\n\r\nBut boys nowadays do not seem to read Robinson Crusoe as they used to\r\ndo. It is too long, they think, and there is much in it that they have\r\nnot time to read. That is why I have written here, in as few words as\r\npossible, the tale of Robinson’s twenty-eight years in his Island, and\r\nI hope that you, and other boys, will like it.\r\n\r\nThe sea that lay round Robinson’s island is not like the one you\r\nknow--the grey North Sea, stormy and cold; but it is blue like a\r\nsapphire, and where the rollers break in white foam on the coral\r\nreefs it seems as if it were edged with pearls. On the shores of the\r\nislands, cocoa-nut palms wave their feathery fronds in the breeze;\r\nbutterflies of wondrous colours hover about; and in and out amongst the\r\nthick-leaved trees dash birds, chattering and screaming, all crimson\r\nand blue and yellow and green.\r\n\r\nOften there are snakes too, and it was lucky that no snakes on\r\nRobinson’s island troubled him. For on some islands that I have seen\r\nthere are snakes--black and white, the most poisonous of them--that\r\nswim about in the sea and come up on the beach, and you have to be\r\ncareful that you do not sit down on the top of one, for they are not\r\nalways very quick at getting out of the way.\r\n\r\nWhen you are a man, perhaps some day you will go to one of those\r\ntropical islands. And if you take a boat and row out to the inside of\r\nthe reef of coral that lies round the island, and put your face close\r\ndown, and look through the quiet, crystal clear water, you will know\r\nwhat Fairyland beneath the sea is like. You will find there gardens\r\nof a beauty never seen on land, only the branches of the trees are of\r\ncoral, and in and out amongst them, instead of bright-coloured birds,\r\nyou will see fishes swimming, some of a vivid yellow and black, others\r\nblue as the sky. That is where the mermaids used to play, when the\r\nworld was younger than it is now.\r\n\r\n  Yours affectionately,\r\n\r\n  JOHN LANG.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n Chap.

Though\r\nhe never even saw the sea till he was quite a big boy, he had always\r\nwanted to be a sailor, and to go away in a ship to visit strange,\r\nforeign, far-off lands; and he thought that if he could only do that,\r\nhe would be quite happy.\r\n\r\nBut his father wanted him to be a lawyer, and he often talked to\r\nRobinson, and told him of the terrible things that might happen to him\r\nif he went away, and how people who stopped at home were always the\r\nhappiest. He told him, too, how Robinson’s brother had gone away, and\r\nhad been killed in the wars.\r\n\r\nSo Robinson promised at last that he would give up wanting to be a\r\nsailor. But in a few days the longing came back as bad as ever, and\r\nhe asked his mother to try to coax his father to let him go just one\r\nvoyage. But his mother was very angry, and his father said, ‘If he goes\r\nabroad he will be the most miserable wretch that ever was born. I can\r\ngive no consent to it.’\r\n\r\nRobinson stopped at home for another year, till he was nineteen years\r\nold, all the time thinking and thinking of the sea. But one day when\r\nhe had gone on a visit to Hull, a big town by the sea, to say good-bye\r\nto one of his friends who was going to London, he could not resist the\r\nchance. Without even sending a message to his father and mother, he\r\nwent on board his friend’s ship, and sailed away.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as the wind began to blow and the waves to rise, poor\r\nRobinson was very frightened and sea-sick, and he said to himself that\r\nif ever he got on shore he would go straight home and never again leave\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHe was very solemn till the wind stopped blowing. His friend and the\r\nsailors laughed at him, and called him a fool, and he very soon forgot,\r\nwhen the weather was fine and the sun shining, all he had thought about\r\ngoing back to his father and mother.\r\n\r\nBut in a few days, when the ship had sailed as far as Yarmouth Roads\r\non her way to London, they had to anchor, and wait for a fair wind. In\r\nthose days there were no steamers, and vessels had only their sails to\r\nhelp them along; so if it was calm, or the wind blew the wrong way,\r\nthey had just to wait where they were till a fair wind blew.\r\n\r\nWhilst they lay at Yarmouth the weather became very bad, and there was\r\na great storm. The sea was so heavy and Robinson’s ship was in such\r\ndanger, that at last they had to cut away the masts in order to ease\r\nher and to stop her from rolling so terribly. The Captain fired guns\r\nto show that his ship wanted help. So a boat from another ship was\r\nlowered, and came with much difficulty and took off Robinson and all\r\nthe crew, just before their vessel sank; and they got ashore at last,\r\nvery wet and miserable, having lost all their clothes except what they\r\nhad on.\r\n\r\nBut Robinson had some money in his pocket, and he went on to London by\r\nland, thinking that if he returned home now, people would laugh at him.\r\n\r\nIn London he made friends with a ship’s captain, who had not long\r\nbefore come home from a voyage to the Guinea Coast, as that part of\r\nAfrica was then called; and the Captain was so pleased with the money\r\nhe had made there, that he easily persuaded Robinson to go with him on\r\nhis next voyage.\r\n\r\nSo Robinson took with him toys, and beads, and other things, to sell to\r\nthe natives in Africa, and he got there, in exchange for these things,\r\nso much gold dust that he thought he was soon going in that way to make\r\nhis fortune.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore he went on a second voyage.\r\n\r\nBut this time he was not so lucky, for before they reached the African\r\nCoast, one morning, very early, they sighted another ship, which they\r\nwere sure was a Pirate. So fast did this other vessel sail, that before\r\nnight she had come up to Robinson’s ship, which did not carry nearly so\r\nmany men nor so many guns as the Pirate, and which therefore did not\r\nwant to fight; and the pirates soon took prisoner Robinson and all the\r\ncrew of his ship who were not killed, and made slaves of them.\r\n\r\nThe Pirate captain took Robinson as his own slave, and made him dig\r\nin his garden and work in his house. Sometimes, too, he made him look\r\nafter his ship when she was in port, but he never took him away on a\r\nvoyage.\r\n\r\nFor two years Robinson lived like this, very unhappy, and always\r\nthinking how he might escape.\r\n\r\nAt last, when the Captain happened one time to be at home longer than\r\nusual, he began to go out fishing in a boat two or three times a week,\r\ntaking Robinson, who was a very good fisher, and a black boy named\r\nXury, with him.\r\n\r\nOne day he gave Robinson orders to put food and water, and some guns,\r\nand powder and shot, on a big boat that the pirates had taken out of an\r\nEnglish ship, and to be ready to go with him and some of his friends on\r\na fishing trip.\r\n\r\nBut at the last moment the Captain’s friends could not come, and so\r\nRobinson was told to go out in the boat with one of the Captain’s\r\nservants who was not a slave, and with Xury, to catch fish for supper.\r\n\r\nThen Robinson thought that his chance to escape had come.\r\n\r\nHe spoke to the servant, who was not very clever, and persuaded him to\r\nput more food and water on the boat, for, said Robinson, ‘we must not\r\ntake what was meant for our master.’ And then he got the servant to\r\nbring some more powder and shot, because, Robinson said, they might as\r\nwell kill some birds to eat.\r\n\r\nWhen they had gone out about a mile, they hauled down the sail and\r\nbegan to fish. But Robinson pretended that he could not catch anything\r\nthere, and he said that they ought to go further out. When they had\r\ngone so far that nobody on shore could see what they were doing,\r\nRobinson again pretended to fish. But this time he watched his chance,\r\nand when the servant was not looking, came behind him and threw him\r\noverboard, knowing that the man could swim so well that he could easily\r\nreach the land.\r\n\r\nThen Robinson sailed away with Xury down the coast to the south. He did\r\nnot know to what country he was steering, but cared only to get away\r\nfrom the pirates, and to be free once more.\r\n\r\nLong days and nights they sailed, sometimes running in close to the\r\nland, but they were afraid to go ashore very often, because of the wild\r\nbeasts and the natives. Many times they saw great lions come roaring\r\ndown on to the beach, and once Robinson shot one that he saw lying\r\nasleep, and took its skin to make a bed for himself on the boat.\r\n\r\nAt last, after some weeks, when they had got south as far as the great\r\ncape that is called Cape de Verde, they saw a Portuguese vessel, which\r\ntook them on board. It was not easy for Robinson to tell who he was,\r\nbecause he could not talk Portuguese, but everybody was very kind to\r\nhim, and they bought his boat and his guns and everything that he had.\r\nThey even bought poor Xury, who, of course, was a black slave, and\r\ncould be sold just like a horse or a dog.\r\n\r\nSo, when they got to Brazil, where the vessel was bound, Robinson had\r\nenough money to buy a plantation; and he grew sugar and tobacco there\r\nfor four years, and was very happy and contented for a time, and made\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Once Robinson shot a lion that he saw lying asleep]\r\n\r\nBut he could never be contented for very long. So when some of his\r\nneighbours asked him if he would go in a ship to the Guinea Coast to\r\nget slaves for them, he went, only making a bargain that he was to\r\nbe paid for his trouble, and to get some of the slaves to work on his\r\nplantation when he came back.\r\n\r\nTwelve days after the ship sailed, a terrible storm blew, and they were\r\ndriven far from where they wanted to go. Great, angry, foaming seas\r\nbroke over the deck, sweeping everything off that could be moved, and\r\na man and a boy were carried overboard and drowned. No one on the ship\r\nexpected to be saved.\r\n\r\nThis storm was followed by another, even worse. The wind howled and\r\nroared through the rigging, and the weather was thick with rain and\r\nflying spray.\r\n\r\nThen early one morning land was dimly seen through the driving rain,\r\nbut almost at once the vessel struck on a sand-bank. In an instant the\r\nsails were blown to bits, and flapped with such uproar that no one\r\ncould hear the Captain’s orders. Waves poured over the decks, and the\r\nvessel bumped on the sand so terribly that the masts broke off near\r\nthe deck, and fell over the side into the sea.\r\n\r\nWith great difficulty the only boat left on the ship was put in the\r\nwater, and everybody got into her. They rowed for the shore, hoping to\r\nget perhaps into some bay, or to the mouth of a river, where the sea\r\nwould be quiet.\r\n\r\nBut before they could reach the land, a huge grey wave, big like the\r\nside of a house, came foaming and thundering up behind them, and before\r\nany one could even cry out, it upset the boat, and they were all left\r\nstruggling in the water.\r\n\r\nRobinson was a very good swimmer, but no man could swim in such a sea,\r\nand it was only good fortune that brought him at last safely to land.\r\nBig wave after big wave washed him further and further up the beach,\r\nrolling him over and over, once leaving him helpless, and more than\r\nhalf-drowned, beside a rock.\r\n\r\nBut before the next wave could come up, perhaps to drag him back with\r\nit into the sea, he was able to jump up and run for his life.\r\n\r\nAnd so he got safely out of the reach of the water, and lay down upon\r\nthe grass. But of all on board the ship, Robinson was the only one who\r\nwas not drowned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                     ROBINSON WORKS HARD AT MAKING\r\n                            HIMSELF A HOME\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen he had rested a little, Robinson got up and began to walk about\r\nvery sadly, for darkness was coming on; he was wet, and cold, and\r\nhungry, and he did not know where to sleep, because he was afraid of\r\nwild beasts coming out of the woods and killing him during the night.\r\n\r\nBut he found that he still had his knife in his pocket, so he cut a big\r\nstick to protect himself with. Then he climbed into a tree which had\r\nvery thick leaves, and there he fixed himself among the branches as\r\nwell as he could, and fell sound asleep.\r\n\r\nIn the morning when he awoke, the storm was past, and the sea quieter.\r\nTo his surprise, he saw that the ship had been carried in the night,\r\nby the great seas, much nearer to the shore than she had been when the\r\nboat left her, and was now lying not far from the rock where Robinson\r\nhad first been washed up.\r\n\r\nBy midday the sea was quite calm, and the tide had gone so far out that\r\nhe could walk very near to the ship. So he took off his clothes and\r\nswam the rest of the way to her. But it was not easy to get on board,\r\nbecause the ship was resting on the sand, and lay so high out of the\r\nwater that Robinson could not reach anything by which he could pull\r\nhimself up.\r\n\r\nAt last, after swimming twice round the vessel, he saw a rope hanging\r\nover, near the bow, and by its help he climbed on board.\r\n\r\nEverything in the stern of the ship was dry, and in pretty good order,\r\nand the water had not hurt the provisions much. So he took some\r\nbiscuits, and ate them as he looked about, and drank some rum, and then\r\nhe felt better, and stronger, and more fit to begin work.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, he took a few large spars of wood, and a spare topmast or\r\ntwo, that were on the deck. These he pushed overboard, tying each with\r\na rope to keep it from drifting away. Then he went over the side of the\r\nship, and tied all the spars together so as to make a raft, and on top\r\nhe put pieces of plank across. But it was long before he could make the\r\nraft fit to carry the things he wanted to take on shore.\r\n\r\nAt last, after much hard work, he got on to it three of the seamen’s\r\nchests, which he had broken open and emptied, and he filled these with\r\nbread, and rice, and cheese, and whatever he could find to eat, and\r\nwith all sorts of things that he thought he might need. He found, too,\r\nthe carpenter’s tool chest, and put it on the raft; and nothing on the\r\nwhole ship was of more use to him than that.\r\n\r\nThen he set about looking for clothes, for while he had been on the\r\nship, the tide had risen and had washed away his coat and waistcoat\r\nand shirt, which he had left lying on the sand.\r\n\r\nGuns and pistols also, and powder and shot, he took, and two old rusty\r\ncutlasses.\r\n\r\nNow the trouble was to reach land, for the raft had no mast nor sail\r\nnor rudder, and was too heavy and clumsy to be pulled by Robinson with\r\nthe broken oars that he had found. But the tide was rising, and slowly\r\nshe drifted nearer and nearer, and at last was carried up the mouth of\r\na little river which Robinson had not seen when he was on shore.\r\n\r\nThere was a strong tide running up, which once carried the raft against\r\na point of land, where she stuck for a time, and very nearly upset all\r\nthe things into deep water. But as the tide rose higher, Robinson was\r\nable to push her into a little bay where the water was shallow and the\r\nground beneath flat, and when the tide went out there she was left high\r\nand dry, and he got everything safely ashore.\r\n\r\nThe next thing that Robinson did was to climb a hill, that he might\r\nsee what sort of country he was in, and find out if there were any\r\nother people in it. But when he got to the top, he saw to his sorrow\r\nthat he was on an island, with no other land in sight except some\r\nrocks, and two smaller islands far over the sea. There were no signs of\r\nany people, and he saw nothing living except great numbers of birds,\r\none of which he shot. But it was not fit to eat, being some kind of\r\nhawk.\r\n\r\nAfter this, with the chests and boards that he had brought on shore, he\r\nmade a kind of hut to sleep in that night, and he lay there on the sand\r\nvery comfortably.\r\n\r\nDay by day now for some time Robinson swam out to the ship, and made\r\nfresh rafts, loading them with many stores, powder and shot, and lead\r\nfor bullets, seven muskets, a great barrel of bread, three casks of\r\nrum, a quantity of flour, some grain, a box of sugar, sails and ropes\r\nand twine, bags of nails, and many hatchets. With one of the sails he\r\nmade himself a good tent, in which he put everything that could be\r\nspoiled by rain or sun. Around it he piled all the casks and other\r\nheavy things, so that no wild beast could very easily get at him.\r\n\r\nIn about a fortnight the weather changed; it blew very hard one night,\r\nand in the morning the ship had broken up, and was no more to be seen.\r\nBut that did not so much matter, for Robinson had got out of her nearly\r\neverything that he could use.\r\n\r\nNow, Robinson thought it time to find some better place for his tent.\r\nThe land where it then stood was low and near the sea, and the only\r\nwater he could get to drink tasted rather salt. Looking about, he found\r\na little plain, about a hundred yards across, on the side of a hill,\r\nand at the end of the plain was a great rock partly hollowed out, but\r\nnot so as quite to make a cave. Here he pitched his tent, close to the\r\nhollow place in the rock. Round in front of the tent he drove two rows\r\nof strong stakes, about eighteen inches apart, sharpened at top; and he\r\nmade this fence so strong that when it was finished he was sure that\r\nnothing could get at him, for he left no door, but climbed in and out\r\nby a ladder, which he always hauled up after him.\r\n\r\nBefore closing up the end, Robinson hauled inside this fence all his\r\nstores, his food and his guns, his powder and shot, and he rigged\r\ninside a double tent, so better to keep off the hot sun and the rain.\r\n\r\nThen he began to dig into the rock, which was not very hard, and soon\r\nbehind his tent he had a cave in which he thought it wise to stow his\r\ngunpowder, about one hundred and forty pounds in all, packed in small\r\nparcels; for, he thought, if a big thunderstorm were to come, a flash\r\nof lightning might explode it all, and blow him to bits, if he kept the\r\nwhole of it in his tent.\r\n\r\nRobinson was now very comfortable, and as he had saved from the wreck\r\ntwo cats and a dog, he did not feel quite so lonely. He had got, also,\r\nink and pens and paper, so that he could keep a diary; and he set up\r\na large wooden cross, on which he cut with his knife the date of his\r\nlanding on the island--30th September 1659; and every day he cut a\r\nnotch on the post, with a longer one each Sunday, so that he might\r\nalways know how the months and years passed.\r\n\r\nAs for food, he found that there were many goats on the island, and\r\nnumbers of pigeons, and he had no difficulty in shooting as many as he\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nBut now he saw that his tent and cave were too small for all the things\r\nhe had stowed in them, so he began to make the cave bigger, bringing\r\nout all the rock and soil that he cut down, and making with it a\r\nkind of terrace round the inside of his stockade. And as he was sure\r\nthat there were no wild beasts on the island to harm him, he went on\r\ntunnelling to the right hand till he broke through the rock outside his\r\nfence.\r\n\r\nThen he began to hang things up against the side of the cave, and he\r\neven made shelves, and a door for the outside entrance. This was a very\r\ndifficult job, and took him a long time; for, to make a board, he was\r\nforced to cut down a whole tree, and chop away with his axe till one\r\nside was flat, and then cut at the other side till the board was thin\r\nenough, when he smoothed it with his adze. But in this way, out of each\r\ntree he would only get one plank. He made for himself also a table and\r\na chair, and finally got his castle, as he called it, in very good\r\norder.\r\n\r\nWith all his care, however, there was one thing that he forgot, and\r\nthat was, when he had made the cave so much bigger, to prop it, so as\r\nto keep the roof from falling in. And so one day he got a terrible\r\nfright, and was nearly killed, by a huge bit of the soft rock which\r\nfell and buried many of his things. It took weeks of hard work\r\nafterwards to clear away the fallen rubbish, and to cut beams strong\r\nenough to prop the roof.\r\n\r\nEvery day, all this time, he used to climb up the hill and look around\r\nover the lonely waters, hoping, always hoping, that some morning he\r\nmight see the sails of a ship that would take him home. But none ever\r\ncame, and sometimes the tears ran down his cheeks because of the sorrow\r\nhe felt at being so utterly alone. At times even, he thought in his\r\nmisery that if only he had any kind of a boat, it would be better to\r\nsail away, and chance reaching other land, rather than to stop where\r\nhe was. By and by, however, he grew less unhappy, for he had plenty of\r\nwork to do.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                     THE EARTHQUAKE AND HURRICANE;\r\n                     AND HOW ROBINSON BUILT A BOAT\r\n\r\n\r\nNow about this time, when Robinson had been some months on the island,\r\nheavy and constant rain began to fall, and sometimes weeks would pass\r\nwithout a single dry day. He found that instead of there being Spring,\r\nSummer, Autumn, and Winter, as in England, the seasons in his island\r\nwere divided into the wet and the dry. There was no cold weather, no\r\nwinter. It chanced that just before this first rain began, Robinson\r\nhad emptied out some refuse from bags which had once held rice, and\r\nother grain, and he had forgotten all about having emptied them. So he\r\nwas very much astonished to find, some time afterwards, both barley\r\nand rice growing near his tent, in the shade of the rock. The ears,\r\nwhen ripe, he kept to sow again, and from this very small beginning,\r\nin the course of a few seasons, he had a great quantity of grain, both\r\nfor food and for sowing. But this meant every year much hard work, for\r\nhe had no plough nor harrow, and all the ground had to be dug with a\r\nclumsy spade, made from a very hard, heavy wood that grew on the island.\r\n\r\nAt first Robinson could not grind the grain that he grew, nor make\r\nbread from it. If he could have found a large stone, slightly hollow on\r\ntop, he might, by pounding the grain on it with another round stone,\r\nhave made very good meal. But all the stones he could find were too\r\nsoft, and in the end he had to make a sort of mill of hard wood, in\r\nwhich he burnt a hollow place, and on that he pounded the grain into\r\nmeal with a heavy stick.\r\n\r\nBaking he did by building a big fire, then raking away the ashes, and\r\nputting the dough on the hot place, covered with a kind of basin made\r\nof clay, over which he heaped the red ashes. In this way very good\r\nbread can be made.\r\n\r\nBefore the rainy season was over, and just after he had finished the\r\nfence round his tent, one day when Robinson was at work in the cave,\r\nall of a sudden the earth began to fall from the roof, and the strong\r\nprops he had put in cracked in a way which frightened him terribly.\r\nAt the same time there was a curious moaning, rumbling noise, that he\r\ncould not understand. He rushed out, and so afraid was he that the roof\r\nwas falling in, and that he should be buried, that he got over the\r\nfence and began to run.\r\n\r\nBut he was even more frightened when he found that all the ground was\r\nshaking. Then he knew that this was an earthquake.\r\n\r\nThree times there came violent shocks; a huge rock about half a mile\r\naway fell with a great noise like thunder, and the sea was churned\r\nup as if by a whirlwind. Robinson was sick with the movement of the\r\nground, and trembling with the dread of being swallowed by the earth\r\nas it cracked and gaped; and after the noise and shaking were over, he\r\nwas too frightened to go back to his tent, but sat where he was, all\r\nthe time expecting another shock.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a furious wind began to blow, tearing up trees by the roots,\r\nand lashing the water till nothing could be seen but foam and flying\r\nspray. The air was full of branches and leaves torn off by the\r\nhurricane, and birds in hundreds were swept helpless out to sea. In\r\nabout three hours, as suddenly as it had begun, the wind fell, and\r\nthere was a dead calm, followed by rain such as Robinson had never\r\nbefore seen, which soaked him to the skin, and forced him to return to\r\nthe cave, where he sat in great fear.\r\n\r\nFor long after this he was very uneasy, and made up his mind to shift\r\nhis quarters as soon as he could find a better place for his tent. But\r\nthe earthquake had one good result, for what remained of the wreck\r\nwas again thrown up by the sea, and Robinson got more things out of\r\nit which were useful to him, and for days he worked hard at that. One\r\nday, too, when he was on his way to the remains of the ship, he came\r\non a large turtle, which he killed, and this gave him plenty of good\r\nfood, for besides the flesh, there were, inside the animal, many eggs,\r\nwhich she had come to the shore to lay in the sand, as is the habit of\r\nturtles, and which Robinson thought were even better than hen’s eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: One day he came on a large turtle]\r\n\r\nNow a few days after he had got so wet in the heavy rain, though the\r\nweather was hot, Robinson felt very cold and shivery, and had pains all\r\nover his body, and at night he dreamed terrible dreams. The following\r\nday, and many days, he lay very ill with fever and ague, and hardly\r\nknew what he was doing. So weak was he, that he believed he was dying,\r\nand there was no one to give him water to quench his thirst, nor to\r\nhelp him in any way. His only medicine was rum, in which he had soaked\r\ntobacco. It was very nasty, and made him sick, but it also made him\r\nsleep for more than a whole day and a night, and he woke much better,\r\nand able to walk about a little, though for a fortnight he was too weak\r\nto work. From this illness he learned not to go out more than he could\r\nhelp during the rainy season.\r\n\r\nWhen he was again quite strong, Robinson started to explore the island\r\nbetter than he had yet done, and he found many things growing, of which\r\nhe made great use afterwards, tobacco, sugar-cane, and all manner of\r\nfruits, amongst them grapes, which he used to dry to raisins in the sun\r\nin great quantities.\r\n\r\nNear the spot where the most fruit grew, he built a hut, and round it,\r\nfor safety, he put a double fence made of stakes cut from some of the\r\ntrees near at hand. During the next rainy season these stakes took\r\nroot, and grew so fast that soon nothing of the hut could be seen from\r\noutside the hedge, and it made so good a hiding-place, that Robinson\r\ncut more stakes of the same kind, and planted them outside the fence\r\naround his first dwelling; and in a year or two that also was quite\r\nhidden from view. The twigs of this tree, too, were good for making\r\nbaskets, of which he had been in great need.\r\n\r\nWhen he had finished all this work, he started again to go over the\r\nrest of the island, and on his way across, from a hill, the day being\r\nvery clear, he saw high land a great way off over the water, but\r\nwhether it was another island, or the coast of America, he could not be\r\nsure.\r\n\r\nWhen he reached the other side of his island Robinson found the beach\r\ncovered with turtles in astonishing numbers, and he thought how much\r\nbetter off he would have been if he had been cast ashore here, for not\r\nonly would the turtles have supplied him with plenty of food, but there\r\nwere far more birds than on the part of the island where he had been\r\nliving, and far more goats.\r\n\r\nDuring the journey back to his castle he caught a young parrot, which,\r\nafter a long time, he taught to speak and to call him by his name. It\r\nwas so long since he had heard any voice, that it was a comfort to\r\nlisten even to a parrot talking.\r\n\r\nNow, the sight which Robinson had had of the far distant land raised in\r\nhim again the great longing to get away from this island where he had\r\nbeen so long alone, and he wished greatly for a boat. He went over to\r\nthe remains of the boat in which he and the others had tried to come\r\nashore when their ship struck on the sand-bank, and which had been\r\nflung far up on the beach by the sea, and he worked for weeks trying to\r\nrepair her and to get her into the water. But it was all of no use; he\r\ncould not move her.\r\n\r\nThen, he thought, ‘I’ll cut down a tree, and make a new boat.’ This he\r\nfancied would be easy, for he had heard how the Indians make canoes by\r\nfelling a tree and burning out the inside. ‘If they can do it, then\r\nsurely I can do it even better,’ he thought. So he looked about, and\r\nchose a huge tree which stood about a hundred yards from the water, and\r\nwith great labour in about three weeks he had cut it down.\r\n\r\nFour months Robinson worked at this boat, thinking all the time of what\r\nhe would do when he reached the far distant land, and much pleased with\r\nhimself for the beautiful boat he was making. Day after day he trimmed\r\nand shaped it, and very proud he was when it was finished and lay there\r\non the ground, big enough to carry twenty men.\r\n\r\nThen he started to get her into the water. But that was quite another\r\nthing. By no means in his power could he move her an inch, try as he\r\nmight. She was far too big. Then he began to dig a canal from the sea\r\nto the boat; but before he had got much of that work done, he saw\r\nclearly that there was so much earth to dig away, that, without some\r\none to help him, it must take years and years before he could get the\r\nwater to the boat. So he gave it up, and left her to lie and rot in the\r\nsun and the rain,--a great grief to him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                    ROBINSON BUILDS A SECOND BOAT,\r\n                    IN WHICH HE IS SWEPT OUT TO SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the time that Robinson had been four years on the island, all his\r\nclothes had become very ragged, and he had hardly anything that could\r\nbe called a hat. Clothes he must have, for he could not go naked\r\nwithout getting his skin blistered by the hot sun, and he was afraid of\r\ngetting a sunstroke if he went about without a hat.\r\n\r\nNow he had kept all the skins of the goats, and other animals, such as\r\nhares and foxes, that he had shot; and from these, after many failures,\r\nat last he made a hat and coat of goatskin, and a pair of short\r\ntrousers, all with the hair outside, so as to shoot off the wet when it\r\nrained. The hat was very tall, and came to a sharp peak on top, and it\r\nhad a flap which hung down the back of his neck. Robinson also, with\r\nmuch trouble, made of the skins an umbrella which he could open and\r\nshut; and if his clothes and his umbrella, and especially his hat, were\r\nnot very good to look at, they were useful, and he could now go about\r\nin any weather.\r\n\r\nDuring the next five years nothing out of the common happened, and\r\nRobinson’s time was mostly taken up with the getting of food, the\r\nyearly sowing and reaping of his crops, and the curing of his raisins.\r\nBut towards the end of that time he made another attempt to build a\r\nboat, and this time he made one much smaller than the first, and though\r\nit took him nearly two years to finish, in the end he got her into the\r\nsea. She was not big enough for him to try to sail in to the far-off\r\nland that he had seen, and he used her only for cruising about the\r\nshores of his own island, and for fishing. In her he fixed a little\r\nmast, on which he rigged a small sail, made from a bit of one of the\r\nold ship’s sails, and, using a paddle to steer with, he found that she\r\nsailed very well. Over the stern he fixed his big umbrella, to shade\r\nhim from the sun, like an awning.\r\n\r\nEager to go all round the island, one day Robinson put a lot of food\r\non board, and, taking his gun, started on a voyage. All went well till\r\nhe came to the east end of the island, where he found that a ledge of\r\nrocks, and beyond that a sand-bank, stretched out to sea for eight\r\nor nine miles. Robinson did not like the idea of venturing so far in\r\na boat so small, and he therefore ran the boat ashore, and climbed a\r\nhill, to get a good view of the rocks and shoals before going near\r\nthem. From the hill, he saw that a strong current was sweeping past\r\nthe sand-bank, which showed just clear of the water, and on which the\r\nsea was breaking; but he thought there was an eddy which would swing\r\nhim safely round the point, without bringing him near the breakers.\r\nHowever, that day and the next, there was a good deal of wind blowing\r\nin the direction contrary to the current, which, of course, raised a\r\nsea too big for a small boat, so Robinson stopped on shore where he was.\r\n\r\nOn the third day it was calm, and he set off. But no sooner had he come\r\nabreast of the sand-bank than he found himself in very deep water, with\r\na current running like a mill-race, which carried the boat further and\r\nfurther away from the land, in spite of all that he could do with his\r\npaddle. There was no wind, and the sail was useless.\r\n\r\nNow he gave himself up for lost, for the harder he worked, only the\r\nfurther away seemed the boat to be swept. The island was soon so far\r\noff that Robinson could hardly see it, and he was quite exhausted\r\nwith the hard struggle to paddle the boat against the current. He was\r\nin despair, and giving up paddling, left the boat to drift where she\r\nwould. Just then a faint puff of wind touched his cheek, and Robinson\r\nhurriedly hoisted his sail. Soon a good breeze blew, which carried him\r\npast a dangerous reef of rocks. Here the current seemed to divide, the\r\npart in which he now was began to swing round towards the island, and\r\nhe plucked up heart again, and with his paddle did all he could to help\r\nthe sail. Robinson felt like a man who is set free after he has been\r\ntold that he must die; he could almost have wept for joy. Miles and\r\nmiles he sailed, steadily getting nearer to the land, and late in the\r\nevening at last he got ashore, but on the other side of the point that\r\nhe had tried to round in the morning. He drew up his boat on the shore\r\nof a little cove that he found, and when he had made her fast, so that\r\nthe tide could not carry her away, there amongst the trees he lay down,\r\nand slept sound, quite worn out.\r\n\r\nIn the morning he again got on board, and coasted along close inshore,\r\ntill he came to a bay with a little river running into it, which made a\r\nvery good harbour for the boat. Here he left her, and went on foot.\r\n\r\nSoon he found that he was not far from a spot that he had once before\r\nvisited, and by afternoon he arrived at the hut which he called his\r\ncountry-house. Robinson got over the fence by the ladder, as usual,\r\npulling it up after him, and then he lay down to rest in the shade, for\r\nhe was still very weary from the hard work of the day before. Soon he\r\nfell asleep. But what was his surprise in a little time to be awakened\r\nby a voice calling, ‘Robin! Robin Crusoe! where are you?’\r\n\r\nAt first he thought he was dreaming. But still the voice went on\r\ncalling:\r\n\r\n‘Where are you, Robin?’\r\n\r\nUp he jumped, trembling with fright and wonder, for it was so long\r\nsince he had heard any voice but his own that he fancied it must be\r\nsomething more than human that he now listened to. But no sooner had\r\nhe risen than he saw, sitting on a tree near to him, his parrot, which\r\nmust have flown all the way from Robinson’s other house, where he had\r\nbeen left. It was talking away at a great rate, very excited at again\r\nseeing its master, and Robinson hardly knew whether to be more relieved\r\nor disappointed that it was only the bird that had called him.\r\n\r\nFor about a year after this Robinson kept to his own side of the\r\nisland, and employed his time chiefly in working on his land, and\r\nin making dishes and pots of clay. These he had now learned to burn\r\nproperly. Pipes, too, he made, and they were a great comfort to him,\r\nfor he managed to cure very good tobacco from the wild plants that grew\r\naround. And as he feared lest his powder might begin to run short, he\r\nthought much over ways whereby he could trap goats for food, instead\r\nof shooting them. After many trials, the best plan, he decided, was to\r\ndig holes, which he covered with thin branches and leaves, on which he\r\nsprinkled earth, so that when anything heavy passed over, it must fall\r\ninto the pit. By this means he caught many, and the kids he kept and\r\ntamed, so that in no great time he had quite a large herd of goats.\r\nThese he kept in various small fields, round which from time to time he\r\nhad put fences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                   ROBINSON SEES A FOOTPRINT ON THE\r\n                       SAND, AND FINDS TRACES OF\r\n                            CANNIBAL FEASTS\r\n\r\n\r\nAll this time Robinson had never gone near his canoe, but now the\r\nlonging came on him to go over to where he had left her, though he\r\nfelt that he should be afraid again to put to sea in her. This time,\r\nhowever, when he got to the hill from which he had watched the set of\r\nthe current the day that he had been carried out to sea, he noticed\r\nthat there was no current to be seen, from which he concluded that\r\nit must depend on the ebb and flow of the tide. Still, he was afraid\r\nto venture far in the canoe, though he stopped some time at his\r\ncountry-house, and went out sailing very often.\r\n\r\nOne day when Robinson was walking along the sand towards his boat,\r\nsuddenly, close to the water, he stopped as if he had been shot, and,\r\nwith thumping heart, stood staring in wonder and fear at something that\r\nhe saw. The mark of a naked foot on the sand! It could not be his own,\r\nhe knew, for the shape was quite different. Whose could it be?\r\n\r\nHe listened, he looked about, but nothing could he hear or see. To the\r\ntop of a rising ground he ran, and looked all around. There was nothing\r\nto be seen. And though he searched everywhere on the beach for more\r\nfootmarks, he found none.\r\n\r\nWhose footprint could it be? That of some man, perhaps, he thought, who\r\nmight come stealing on him out from the trees, or murder him whilst he\r\nslept.\r\n\r\nBack to his house he hurried, all the way in a state of terror,\r\nstarting every now and again and facing round, thinking he was being\r\nfollowed, and fancying often that a stump or a bush was a man, waiting\r\nto spring on him. That night he slept not at all, and so shaken was\r\nhis nerve that every cry of a night bird, even every sound made by\r\nan insect or a frog, caused him to start with fear, so that the\r\nperspiration ran down his brow.\r\n\r\nAs day followed day, however, and nothing happened, Robinson began to\r\nbe less uneasy in his mind, and went about his usual work again. But\r\nhe strengthened the fence round his castle, and cut in it seven small\r\nloop-holes, in which, fixed on frames, he placed loaded muskets, all\r\nready to fire if he should be attacked. And some distance from the\r\noutside of the fence he planted a thick belt of small stakes, so that\r\nin a few years’ time a perfect thicket of trees and bushes hid all\r\ntrace of his dwelling.\r\n\r\nYears passed quietly, and nothing further happened to disturb Robinson,\r\nor to make him think more of the footprint that had frightened him so\r\nmuch. But he kept more than formerly to the interior of the island, and\r\nlost no chance of looking for good places to hide in, if he should ever\r\nneed them. And he always carried a cutlass now, as well as his gun and\r\na couple of pistols.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He saw the mark of a naked foot on the sand]\r\n\r\nOne day it chanced, however, that he had gone further to the west of\r\nthe island than he had ever done before, and, looking over the sea,\r\nhe fancied that he saw, at a great distance, something like a boat or\r\na long canoe, but it was so far off that he could not be sure what it\r\nwas. This made him determine that always in future he would bring with\r\nhim to his lookout-place the telescope which he had saved from the\r\nwreck.\r\n\r\nThe sight of this supposed boat brought back his uneasiness to some\r\nextent, but he went on down to the beach, and there he saw a sight\r\nwhich filled him with horror. All about the shore were scattered men’s\r\nskulls and bones, and bits of burnt flesh, and in one place were the\r\nremains of a big fire. Robinson stood aghast, feeling deadly sick. It\r\nwas easy for him to know the meaning of the terrible sight. It meant\r\nthat cannibals had been there, killing and eating their prisoners; for\r\nwhen the natives of some parts of the world go to war, and catch any\r\nof their enemies, it is their habit to build a fire, then to kill the\r\nprisoners and feast on their roasted bodies, eating till they can eat\r\nno more. Sometimes, if the man they are going to eat is too thin, they\r\nkeep him, and feed him up, till they think he is fat enough.\r\n\r\nNow Robinson knew all this, though he had never yet met any cannibals.\r\nAnd when he looked around he saw many bones lying about. They were so\r\nold that it seemed certain to him that all those years he had been\r\nliving on an island which was a regular place for the natives to come\r\nto for such feasts. Then he saw what a mercy it was that he had been\r\nwrecked on the other side of the island, to which, he supposed, the\r\ncannibals never came, because the beach was not so good for them to\r\nland on.\r\n\r\nFull of horror, Robinson hurried back to his house, and for almost two\r\nyears he never again came near that part of the island where the bones\r\nlay, nor ever visited his boat. But all the time he kept thinking how\r\nhe might some day kill those cannibals whilst they were at their feast,\r\nand perhaps save some of the poor men whom they had not yet killed.\r\nSometimes he thought of putting powder below the place where they were\r\nlikely to light their fire, and thus blow them up. But that did not\r\nseem a very good plan, because he did not want to waste his powder, and\r\nmay be they might not light the fire on that spot, or they might not be\r\nnear when it exploded. So he looked for a place where he could hide,\r\nnear where the bones lay, and at last he found a good spot, from which\r\nhe could watch them land. Near this spot were trees, through which he\r\ncould creep up quite close to them, unseen, and so shoot without danger\r\nof missing. And it was his plan, that if he should happen to see the\r\nsavages next time they came over for one of their horrible feasts, he\r\nwould lie hidden till a good chance came, then shoot as many as he\r\ncould with his gun and pistols, and afterwards with his cutlass rush\r\nupon those that were left. In this way he counted on being able to\r\nkill them all, even if there were as many as twenty, for they would be\r\ntaken by surprise, and in the confusion might not be able to get at\r\ntheir spears and clubs.\r\n\r\nWhen he had made this plan, Robinson was so pleased with it that for a\r\ntime he could think of little else, and every day he would walk three\r\nmiles to his lookout-hill, and watch through his telescope for signs of\r\ncanoes coming over the sea towards the island. But after two or three\r\nmonths without result, he grew tired of it. Never a speck was to be\r\nseen on the water in any direction, and he began to go less and less\r\noften to the lookout-hill, and then gave up going altogether. Perhaps\r\ntoo, he thought, it was no business of his; the savages did not know\r\nany better, and were only doing what their fathers had taught them\r\nto do. It was the custom in these savage lands, and Robinson came to\r\nthink, finally, that he had no right to interfere, unless they first\r\nattacked him. He argued also that if he did attack, and it chanced\r\nthat he did not kill them all, that even only one got away, for certain\r\nthat man would tell his tribe as soon as he got home, and they would\r\ncome over in hundreds to murder Robinson in revenge for the death of\r\nthose he had killed. And no doubt they would eat him, the thought of\r\nwhich was very dreadful.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, therefore, it seemed to him wisest to keep away\r\naltogether from that part of the beach, and to hide as well as he could\r\nall traces of any one living on the island. So, except to take away and\r\nconceal his boat, for more than another year he never went back to that\r\nspot. The boat, with her mast and sail and paddle, and a sort of little\r\nanchor he had made for her, he took to the farthest east end of the\r\nisland. He was sure the savages would never come there in their canoes,\r\nbecause of the strong current that usually swept past the rocks; and he\r\nleft her safely moored in a little bay, under the shelter of some high\r\nrocks.\r\n\r\nMore than ever now, Robinson kept to his two houses, and seldom left\r\nthem, except to go to a deep valley he had found, through which ran a\r\nlittle stream of water as clear as crystal, and in which he now kept\r\nmost of his goats, secured by a fence built all round the valley. He\r\nalmost gave up firing his gun, lest it should bring the savages to find\r\nout the cause of the noise; and for the same reason he feared even to\r\nchop wood or to drive a nail. He was particularly careful, too, never\r\nto make a fire during the day, for nothing is so easily seen from a\r\ndistance as smoke, and it would certainly bring the savages on him, if\r\nthey were on the island, or anywhere near it.\r\n\r\nSo, when he needed a big fire, as he did often when burning the clay\r\ndishes and pots which he made, he would generally light it during the\r\nnight. But sometimes in the day-time he would light it in the valley,\r\nwhere the smoke would not show so plainly against the sky or the dark\r\ntrees, owing to the hollow being deep, and in the very middle of the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nPresently, he began to make charcoal, by burning wood under earth and\r\nturf, and this charcoal he often took home to his house to use for\r\ncooking his food, because charcoal makes no smoke.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                   ROBINSON FINDS A CAVE; HEARS GUNS\r\n                      FIRED BY A SHIP IN DISTRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nNow one day when Robinson was down in the bottom of the valley, cutting\r\nthick branches to burn for charcoal, he cleared away some undergrowth\r\nat the foot of a great rock, in which, near the ground, there was a\r\nsort of hole, or opening. Into this hole Robinson squeezed, not very\r\neasily, and found himself in a cave of good size, high enough, at\r\nleast, to stand up in. It was quite dark, of course, to him coming in\r\nfrom the sunlight, and he turned his back to the entrance to feel his\r\nway further in, when suddenly, from the back of the cave he saw two\r\ngreat fiery eyes glaring at him. His very hair bristled with fright,\r\nfor he could only think that it must be the Devil at least that he\r\nsaw; and through the mouth of the cave he fled with a yell.\r\n\r\nBut when he got into the bright sunshine he began to feel ashamed of\r\nhis panic, and to reason with himself that what he had seen must be\r\nonly his own fancy. So, taking up a big burning branch from his fire,\r\nin he went again.\r\n\r\nBefore Robinson had taken three steps he stopped, in almost as great a\r\nfright as at first. Close to him he heard a great sigh, as if of some\r\none in pain, then a sound like a muttering, as of words that he could\r\nnot understand; again another deep sigh. Cold sweat broke out all over\r\nhim, and he stepped back trembling, yet determined this time not to run\r\naway.\r\n\r\nHolding his torch well over his head, he looked around, and there on\r\nthe floor of the cave lay a huge old he-goat, gasping for breath,\r\ndying, seemingly of mere old age.\r\n\r\nHe stirred him with his toe to see if he could get him out of the cave,\r\nbut the poor beast could not rise, and Robinson left him to die where\r\nhe was.\r\n\r\nNow that he had got over his fright, Robinson looked carefully about\r\nhim. The cave was small, not more than twelve feet across at its\r\nwidest, but he noticed at the far end another opening. This was so low\r\ndown, however, that he had to creep on his hands and knees to get in,\r\nand without a better light than the burning torch, he could not see how\r\nfar it went. So he made up his mind to come again.\r\n\r\nRobinson had long before this made a good supply of very fair candles\r\nfrom the tallow of the goats he had killed, and next day he returned to\r\nthe cave with six of these, and his tinder-box to light them with. In\r\nthose days there were no matches, and men used to strike a light with\r\na flint and steel, and tinder, which was a stuff that caught fire very\r\neasily from a spark.\r\n\r\nEntering the cave, Robinson found, on lighting a candle, that the goat\r\nwas now dead. Moving it aside, to be buried later, he went down on\r\nhis hands and knees, and crawled about ten yards through the small\r\npassage, till at last he found himself in a great chamber, the roof of\r\nwhich was quite twenty feet high. On every side the walls reflected the\r\nlight of his candle, and glittered like gold, or almost like diamonds,\r\nhe thought. The floor was perfectly dry and level, even on the walls\r\nthere was no damp, and Robinson was delighted with his discovery. Its\r\nonly drawback was the low entrance; but, as he decided to use the cave\r\nchiefly as a place to retreat to if he should ever be attacked, that\r\nwas in reality an advantage, because one man, if he had firearms, could\r\neasily defend it against hundreds.\r\n\r\nAt once Robinson set about storing in it all his powder, except three\r\nor four pounds, all his lead for making bullets, and his spare guns and\r\nmuskets. When moving the powder, he thought he might as well open a\r\nbarrel which had drifted ashore out of the wreck after the earthquake,\r\nand though water had got into it, there was not a great deal of damage\r\ndone, for the powder had crusted on the outside only, and in the inside\r\nthere was about sixty pounds weight, quite dry and good. This, with\r\nwhat remained of the first lot, gave him a very large supply, enough to\r\nlast all his life.\r\n\r\nFor more than two-and-twenty years Robinson had now been in the island,\r\nand he had grown quite used to it, and to his manner of living. If\r\nhe could only have been sure that no savages would come near him, he\r\nfelt almost that he would be content to spend all the rest of his days\r\nthere, to die at last, as the goat he found in the cave had died, of\r\nold age.\r\n\r\nIt was near the end of the month of December, his harvest time, and\r\nRobinson used then to be much out in his fields even before daylight.\r\nOne morning, being anxious to finish cutting the crop, he had left\r\nhis house even earlier than usual, long before the stars had ceased\r\nto shine or the first flush of dawn had showed in the sky, and as he\r\ncrossed the higher lying ground between his castle and the cornfield,\r\nit chanced that he glanced in the direction of the sea.\r\n\r\nThere, on the shore, to his great horror on his own side of the island,\r\nhe saw a fire burning, and he knew that this could only have been lit\r\nby the cannibals, who had once more landed.\r\n\r\nStraight back to his castle he ran, and climbed hurriedly over the\r\nfence, pulling the ladder up after him. Quickly he loaded all his\r\nmuskets and pistols, ready to defend himself to the last gasp, for\r\nhe was sure that, if these savage men should happen to see his crops\r\ngrowing in the fields, they would know that some one was living on the\r\nisland, and would never rest till they found him.\r\n\r\nBut when Robinson had waited some time without anything happening, he\r\ncould bear the suspense no longer. Taking the telescope, he put his\r\nladder against the rock where there was a flat ledge, and climbing up\r\nto this, pulled the ladder after him, and again resting it there, so\r\nclimbed to the top of the rock, where he lay down and looked eagerly\r\nthrough the glass.\r\n\r\nThere were no less than nine savages, he saw, all sitting round the\r\nfire, cooking something, but what it was that they cooked he could not\r\ntell, though it was not difficult to guess.\r\n\r\nAfter a time they began a kind of dance round the fire, all of them\r\nstark naked, and Robinson watched them at this for nearly two hours.\r\n\r\nThe cannibals had two canoes, which were hauled up on the shore, and as\r\nit was then low water he fancied they must be waiting for the tide to\r\nrise again. And so it turned out, for when the tide had been flowing\r\nfor a time, they shoved off, jumped on board, and paddled away.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Robinson was sure that they were really gone, he went with\r\nall his speed to the hill from where, first of all, long ago, he had\r\nseen signs of savages, and looking through his glass, he saw three more\r\ncanoes at sea, all paddling away from the island. On going down to the\r\nshore, there he saw a dreadful sight. Skulls, bits of flesh, and bones,\r\nlay about, and fresh blood was everywhere, hardly yet soaked into the\r\nsand.\r\n\r\nThis awful sight so horrified and roused Robinson that once more he\r\ndetermined, whenever the next chance came, to attack the cannibals,\r\nhowever many there might be, and kill all that he could. But always,\r\nfor long after, he lived in great uneasiness, never sure that at any\r\nmoment he might not be taken by surprise. Often he wished the time had\r\ncome when he could run at them; for suspense is always harder to bear\r\nthan any action, however dangerous.\r\n\r\nBut many months went by, and no savages were seen, and nothing\r\ndisturbed Robinson except dreadful dreams, from which in the night he\r\noften started out of his sleep, crying out and struggling, thinking\r\nthat the savages were trying to kill him.\r\n\r\nAbout the middle of the following May, one day there came a very great\r\nstorm, with much thunder and lightning and rain, and during the night\r\nthe wind blew a perfect hurricane. Robinson was sitting listening to\r\nthe roaring of the wind, and sometimes reading the Bible which he had\r\nfound in one of the seamen’s chests, for he could not sleep.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he was startled by a kind of dull thud that seemed to shake\r\nthe very air, such a thud as you might hear if something very heavy,\r\nbut soft, fell on the floor of a room upstairs. And this noise was\r\nfollowed in about a minute by another thud. This time he could hear\r\nplainer, and he knew that the sounds were those of big guns fired at\r\nsea, and that they must come from some ship in danger, and signalling\r\nfor help, perhaps to some other vessel.\r\n\r\nRobinson ran out, and climbing up his ladder, got to the top of the\r\nrock in time to see the flash of another gun, away towards the reef of\r\nrocks at the end of the island.\r\n\r\nIf he was not able to help the people on board the vessel, they might\r\nyet, if they were saved, help him, so he collected all the dry wood\r\nhe could get, and making a great pile, set fire to it, as a signal to\r\nthe ship that there was some one on the island. And he was sure that\r\nthe signal was seen, for as soon as it blazed up another gun was fired;\r\nthen gun after gun, for some time.\r\n\r\nRobinson kept his fire blazing all night, and when daylight came, and\r\nthe storm cleared off, he thought he could see, away to the east,\r\nsomething which looked like a ship. He fancied she was at anchor, for\r\nshe never moved. But the distance was too great, and the weather too\r\nthick for him to be sure if it was a ship at all that he saw.\r\n\r\nLater in the day, when the weather had cleared, on going up the hill\r\nfrom which, long ago, he had watched the current sweeping past the\r\nrocks, he could see plainly that there was a vessel, but, to his\r\nsorrow, that she was a wreck, fast on the reef where, the day he was\r\ncarried out to sea, he had found the current divide.\r\n\r\nWithout doubt the crew must have perished. And it filled Robinson\r\nwith sadness and great grief to think how near he had been perhaps\r\nto fellow countrymen, and how not even one had been spared to come\r\nashore. His whole soul yearned for the sight of a white man, some one\r\nto whom he could speak. But all that ever he saw of the crew, except\r\nwhat he afterwards found on the ship itself, was the body of a boy,\r\nwhich drifted on shore at the end of the island nearest the wreck; and\r\nhe could not tell from the few clothes that were on the body to what\r\nnation the boy had belonged. In his pockets were two gold coins, and a\r\ntobacco pipe, and the last at least was of use to Robinson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                  ROBINSON VISITS THE WRECKED SPANISH\r\n                     SHIP; RESCUES A PRISONER FROM\r\n                             THE CANNIBALS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the weather had again become calm and settled, Robinson was\r\ngreatly tempted to venture out in his boat to the wreck, in spite of\r\nthe narrow escape he had had before at that place; but there might\r\nstill, he thought, be some one alive on board, and he made up his mind\r\nto risk it. This time he put a compass in the boat, and great store of\r\nfood and water, as much as she could well carry, and he pushed off,\r\npaddling along the shore till he came near to the end of the sand-bank\r\nwhere the current ran so strong. And there his heart failed him. If he\r\nonce got into that current, how was he to get out of it again? And if\r\nhe were swept out to sea, and a gale of wind sprang up, what chance\r\nwas there that his small boat would live through it? He was so cast\r\ndown by these thoughts that he ran the boat ashore and got out.\r\n\r\nGoing on to a high rock he sat for hours watching the water, trying\r\nto make up his mind whether to venture to the wreck or not, when he\r\nnoticed that the current was now running in the direction contrary to\r\nthat in which it had been flowing the first time he saw it. This, it\r\noccurred to him, must be caused by the tides, and it seemed likely that\r\nif he chose his time, the current going one way would carry him close\r\nto the wreck, and that caused by the next tide would help him back\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThis seemed so simple and easy that he determined to risk it next day.\r\nSleeping that night in the canoe, early in the morning he started, and\r\nin little more than two hours safely reached the wreck, without any\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nShe was a pitiful sight,--Spanish, he judged, from her build. She was\r\nlying on the reef, jammed fast between two rocks, the after part of\r\nher all stove in by the sea. Her main and foremasts had gone over the\r\nside when she struck, and hung about the wreck in a tangle of rigging\r\nand spars. Her bulwarks, and rails, and the poop ladders, were all\r\ngone, and part of one boat still hung on the davits, torn away by the\r\nfurious sea before the crew could attempt to lower it. On board, there\r\nwas no living thing except a dog, which yelped when it saw Robinson\r\ncoming, and jumped into the sea, and swam eagerly to him when he spoke\r\nto it. Poor beast! It was almost dead from thirst. Robinson gave it\r\nwater, and food, and it drank till he was almost afraid it might burst\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Robinson boarded the wreck, and the first thing he saw was\r\ntwo men lying in the cook’s galley, dead, held fast in each other’s\r\narms. Beyond this, there was no trace of any human being, and the\r\ncargo, whatever it might have been, had mostly been washed out of the\r\nwreck by the sea. There were still a few casks of brandy, or wine, low\r\ndown in the bold, but they were too heavy for Robinson to move.\r\n\r\nSome chests there were in the forecastle, which most likely had\r\nbelonged to some of the crew. Two of these Robinson got into his boat,\r\nalong with a small cask of liquor, and other things; a powder-horn full\r\nof powder, a fire-shovel and tongs (which he had always much needed),\r\ntwo little brass kettles, a copper pot, and a gridiron. These, and the\r\ndog, were all that he got from the wreck. The dog was a great comfort\r\nto him, for the animal he had brought ashore from his own ship had now\r\nbeen dead many years.\r\n\r\nExcept what he found in the seamen’s chests, there was nothing of value\r\nin the cargo he brought ashore. In the chests were many things that\r\nhe prized, linen shirts, handkerchiefs, and coloured neckcloths, pots\r\nof sweetmeats, a case of bottles of cordial waters, very handsomely\r\nmounted with silver, and, what then was of less value to him, three\r\ngreat bags of gold pieces, besides gold doubloons, and bars of gold.\r\nBut all this gold he would gladly have given then for a few pairs of\r\nEnglish shoes and stockings, for it was of no use at all to him on the\r\nisland. However, he stowed all the money and the gold in his cave,\r\nalong with the other things, and then returned and worked his boat\r\nalong shore to the harbour where he had kept her so long.\r\n\r\nBut the sight of the wrecked ship and the drowned men had filled him\r\nagain with the longing to go away, and if he had had as good a boat as\r\nthat in which he escaped from the pirates, he thought that he would\r\nhave waited no longer on the island, but would have put to sea in her,\r\nand taken his chance of reaching some land where white men dwelt. With\r\nthe frail craft that he had, however, such a plan was not possible, and\r\nhe had no choice but to go on living as he had already so long lived,\r\nall the time in daily fear of a raid by the savages.\r\n\r\nAnd yet, at times, when his spirits were more than usually low, when\r\nthe burden of the lonely years pressed most heavily upon him, Robinson\r\nused to think that surely if the savages could come to his land, he\r\ncould go to theirs. How far did they come? Where was their country?\r\nWhat kind of boats had they? And so eager to go was he sometimes, that\r\nhe forgot to think of what he would do when he got there, or what would\r\nbecome of him if he fell into the hands of the savages. His mind was\r\nutterly taken up with the one thought of getting to the mainland, and\r\neven his dreams were of little else.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The harbour where he had kept his boat so long]\r\n\r\nOne night, when he had put himself almost into a fever with the trouble\r\nof his mind, he had lain long awake, tossing and moaning, but at last\r\nhe had fallen asleep. And he dreamed, not as he had usually done of\r\nlate, that he was sailing to the mainland, but that as he was leaving\r\nhis castle in the morning he saw on the shore two canoes and eleven\r\nsavages landing, and that they had with them another man, whom they\r\nwere just about to kill and eat, when suddenly the prisoner jumped\r\nup and ran for his life. And in his dream Robinson fancied that the\r\nman came running to hide in the thicket round the castle, and that\r\nthereupon he went out to help him. Then in the dream, the savage\r\nkneeled down, as if begging for mercy, and Robinson took him over the\r\nladder into the castle, saying to himself, ‘Now that I’ve got this\r\nfellow, I can certainly go to the mainland, for he will show me what\r\ncourse to steer, and where to go when we land.’ And he woke, with the\r\njoyful feeling that now at last all was well. But when he was wide\r\nawake, and knew that it was only a dream after all, poor Robinson was\r\nmore cast down than ever, and more unhappy than he had been during all\r\nthe years he had lived on the island.\r\n\r\nThe dream had, however, this result; that he saw his only plan to get\r\naway was, if possible, to rescue some day one of the prisoners whom the\r\ncannibals were about to kill, and in time get the man to help him to\r\nnavigate his canoe across the sea.\r\n\r\nWith this idea, he set himself to watch, more closely than ever he had\r\ndone before, for the savages to land, and during more than a year and a\r\nhalf he went nearly every day to his lookout-place, and swept the sea\r\nwith his telescope, in the hope of seeing canoes coming. But none came,\r\nand Robinson was getting terribly tired of the constant watch. Still\r\nhe did not give up, for he knew that sooner or later the savages would\r\nland again.\r\n\r\nYet many months passed, and still they did not come, till one morning,\r\nvery early, almost to his surprise, he saw no fewer than five canoes\r\nhauled up on the shore on his own side of the island. The savages who\r\nhad come in them were nowhere to be seen. Now, he knew that always from\r\nfour to six men came in each canoe, which meant that at least twenty,\r\nand perhaps as many as thirty men had landed.\r\n\r\nThis was a greater number than he cared to face, so he kept inside his\r\ncastle, in great doubt what to do, but ready to fight, in case they\r\nshould attack him.\r\n\r\nWhen he had waited a long time and still could hear nothing of the\r\nsavages, he climbed up his ladder and got to the top of the rock,\r\ntaking great care not to show himself against the sky-line. Looking\r\nthrough his glass, he saw that there were at least thirty savages,\r\ndancing wildly round a fire.\r\n\r\nAs he looked, some of the men left the others, and going over to the\r\ncanoes dragged from them two prisoners. One of these almost at once\r\nfell forward on his face, knocked down from behind, as it seemed to\r\nRobinson, with a wooden club, and two or three of the cannibals at once\r\ncut him open to be ready for cooking, whilst for a moment or two they\r\nleft the other prisoner standing by himself.\r\n\r\nSeeing a chance of escape, the man made a dash for his life, running\r\nwith tremendous speed along the sands straight for that part of the\r\nbeach near Robinson’s castle.\r\n\r\nNow this alarmed Robinson very much, for it seemed to him that the\r\nwhole of the savages started after the prisoner. He could not help\r\nthinking it likely that, as in his dream, this man would take shelter\r\nin the thicket round the castle, in which case Robinson was likely soon\r\nto have more fighting than he would relish, for the whole body of the\r\ncannibals would be on him at once.\r\n\r\nAs he watched the poor man racing for life, however, he was relieved\r\nto see that he ran much faster than his pursuers, of whom only three\r\ncontinued to run after him. If he could hold out for another mile or\r\ntwo there was little doubt that he would escape. Between the castle and\r\nthe runners was the creek up which Robinson used to run his rafts from\r\nthe wreck, and when the escaped prisoner came to that, he plunged in,\r\nand though the tide was full, with less than thirty powerful strokes\r\nhe reached the other side, and with long easy strides continued his\r\nrun. Of the men in pursuit, two also plunged in and swam through, but\r\nless quickly than the man escaping, being more blown with running,\r\nbecause of what they had eaten before starting. The third man stopped\r\naltogether, and went back the way he came.\r\n\r\nSeeing the turn things were taking, it seemed to Robinson that now had\r\ncome his chance to get a servant, and he resolved to try to save the\r\nlife of the man who was fleeing from the cannibals. At once he hurried\r\ndown the ladder, snatched up his two guns, and running as fast as he\r\ncould, got between the man and his pursuers, calling out to him at\r\nthe same time to stop. The man looked back, and the sight of Robinson\r\nseemed to frighten him at first as much as did the men who were trying\r\nto catch him. But Robinson again spoke, and signed to him with his hand\r\nto come back, and in the meantime went slowly towards the other men,\r\nwho were now coming near. Then, rushing at the foremost, he knocked\r\nhim senseless with the butt of his gun, for it seemed to him safer not\r\nto fire, lest the noise should bring the other cannibals around.\r\n\r\nThe second man, seeing his comrade fall, hesitated, and stopped, but\r\nRobinson saw when nearer to him that the savage had in his hands a bow\r\nand arrow with which he was just about to shoot. There was then no\r\nchoice but to fire first, which Robinson did, killing the man on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nThereupon the man who had been chased by the others was so terrified by\r\nthe flash and noise of the gun, and at seeing his enemy fall dead, that\r\nhe stood stock still, trembling, and it was with great difficulty that\r\nRobinson coaxed him to come near. This at last he did, stopping every\r\nfew paces and kneeling down. At length, coming close to Robinson, he\r\nagain knelt, kissed the ground, and taking hold of Robinson’s foot, set\r\nit on his head as it rested on the sand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The man knelt and kissed the ground]\r\n\r\nWhilst this was going on, Robinson noticed that the savage whom he\r\nhad knocked down had begun to move, and to come to his senses. To this\r\nhe drew the attention of the man whom he had rescued, who said some\r\nwords that Robinson could not understand, but which sounded pleasant to\r\nan ear that had heard no voice but his own for more than twenty-five\r\nyears. Next he made a motion with his hand, as if asking for the\r\ncutlass that hung at Robinson’s belt, and when the weapon was given\r\nto him he ran at his enemy, and with one clean blow cut off his head.\r\nThen, laughing, he brought the head, and laid it with the cutlass at\r\nRobinson’s feet.\r\n\r\nBut what caused most wonder to the man was how the savage whom Robinson\r\nshot had been killed at so great a distance, and he went to look at the\r\nbody, turning it over and over, and looking long at the wound in the\r\nbreast that the bullet had made, evidently much puzzled.\r\n\r\nRobinson then turned to go away, beckoning to the savage to follow, but\r\nthe man made signs that he would bury the two bodies in the sand, so\r\nthat the others might not find them if they followed. With his hands he\r\nsoon scraped holes deep enough to cover the bodies, and in less than a\r\nquarter of an hour there was hardly a trace left of what had happened.\r\n\r\nCalling him away, Robinson now took him, not to his castle, but to the\r\ncave, where he gave him food and water; and then he made signs for him\r\nto lie down and rest, pointing to a bundle of rice straw.\r\n\r\nSoon the man was sound asleep. He was, Robinson thought, a handsome\r\nand well-made man; the muscles of his arms and back and legs showed\r\ngreat strength, and all his limbs were beautifully formed. As near as\r\nRobinson could guess, he was about twenty-six years of age, with a good\r\nand manly face, and long black hair. His nose and lips were like those\r\nof a European, and his teeth were white and even. In colour he was not\r\nblack, but of a sort of rich chocolate brown, the skin shining with\r\nhealth, and pleasant to look upon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                      HOW ROBINSON TRAINED FRIDAY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhilst the man slept, Robinson went out to milk his goats, at which\r\nwork the savage, having waked in about half an hour, found him, and\r\nrunning up, threw himself on the ground near Robinson’s feet, one of\r\nwhich he again raised as before, and placed on his head. At the same\r\ntime he made every kind of sign of gratitude and submission.\r\n\r\nIn a little while Robinson began to speak to him, and to try to teach\r\nhim things. First, he made him understand that his name was to be\r\n‘Friday,’ (that being the day of the week when Robinson had saved him\r\nfrom a horrible death). Then he taught him the meaning of ‘Yes,’ and\r\n‘No,’ and to call Robinson, ‘Master.’\r\n\r\nFriday showed great quickness in learning. He seemed to be happy\r\nand contented, and free from trouble, except that the clothes which\r\nRobinson made him wear gave him at first great discomfort, for in those\r\nwarm parts of the world the natives are not used to clothes, but always\r\ngo about naked. And perhaps they are healthier so, for when rain comes,\r\nthey can cover their skin with cocoa-nut oil, and the wet then runs\r\noff their bodies without chilling them, and they do not catch cold by\r\nwearing damp clothes. Sometimes they make drooping girdles of the broad\r\nleaves of the banana, which are two or three feet long, and wear these\r\nround their waists; and sometimes, for ornament, they stick crimson\r\nflowers behind their ears, or hang them round their necks. But other\r\nclothes they have none to wear.\r\n\r\nAnd indeed such things would only be in the way, for the natives who\r\nlive on the coasts often pass nearly whole days swimming in the warm\r\nsea. They are never afraid of sharks, for they swim so well and so fast\r\nthat often they are able to kill the sharks, diving under them, and\r\nstabbing them in the belly with a knife.\r\n\r\nEven the very little children swim almost before they can walk, and\r\nwhole families go out for a day in the sea, as children and their\r\nparents in England might go for a picnic. One of their games, when a\r\nheavy swell is rolling in, toppling over in cataracts of foam as the\r\nwaves reach the shallower water near the shore, is to swim out, diving\r\nthrough the broken water, and taking with them a light plank. On this,\r\nwhen they have got beyond where the seas break, they mount, and come\r\nrushing in on the crest of the great waves, shrieking with laughter\r\nwhen any one is upset. It is glorious fun, they think.\r\n\r\nThe day following that on which Robinson had saved Friday, they went\r\nout together to see if there were any signs of the cannibals still\r\nbeing on the island, but it was evident that they had gone away without\r\ntroubling about the two men whom Robinson had killed. Round the place\r\nwhere their fire had been, were horrible remains of bodies, pieces of\r\nflesh half eaten, or charred by the fire, skulls, hands, and bones\r\nof legs and feet. Friday made Robinson understand that these were the\r\nremains of three prisoners who had been brought over along with him, to\r\nbe feasted on.\r\n\r\nRobinson’s blood ran cold as he looked, and the horror of the sight\r\nmade him sick and faint. He ordered Friday to collect all the bodies\r\nand other remains, and to build a fire to burn them, which Friday very\r\ncheerfully did. To him it was no great matter, for, of course, all his\r\nlife he himself had been a cannibal, and he was quite used to such\r\nscenes. Indeed, when they passed the spot where the two men had been\r\nburied in the sand, Friday pointed it out to Robinson, and gave him to\r\nunderstand that he meant to come back, and dig up and eat the bodies.\r\nThis filled Robinson with disgust and rage, and he let Friday know that\r\nhe would be severely punished, perhaps killed, if ever such a thing was\r\ndone by him.\r\n\r\nFor some time Robinson did not trust Friday, and did not allow him\r\nto sleep in the same part of his castle with himself, but kept him at\r\nnight in a little tent outside the fence. Every night he drew up the\r\nladder, so that if Friday ever should attempt to get over, he would be\r\nsure to make noise enough to wake Robinson. Other precautions also he\r\ntook, but soon he found that they were not needed. Friday was quite\r\nfaithful. And he was never sulky nor lazy, but always merry, and ready\r\nto do anything that Robinson told him. And as time went on, Robinson\r\ndid not doubt that if there should ever be need for it, Friday would\r\nrisk his life to save his master.\r\n\r\nAt first when they went out in the woods together, Friday was terrified\r\neach time that Robinson’s gun was fired. He had never seen anything put\r\ninto it, and it was more than he could understand how things could be\r\nkilled merely by the noise and the flash of fire. It seemed to him that\r\nthe gun was some sort of evil spirit that might do him harm, and it was\r\nlong before he could be brought to touch one of them, though when he\r\nwas alone Robinson often heard him talking to them. Afterwards, when he\r\ncould speak English better, and knew more about guns, he told Robinson\r\nthat he used to ask them not to kill him.\r\n\r\nOne thing that Robinson could never teach Friday was to eat salt with\r\nhis food. Salt is a thing that the cannibals do not use, and some\r\nof them, to this day, go so far as to say that they do not care to\r\neat a white man, because he is too salt. A native of their own race,\r\nthey think, is much sweeter, though of course they eat only men of a\r\ndifferent tribe whom they may capture during one of their wars. But the\r\nonly form in which they take salt is as sea water, and that they use as\r\nmedicine, drinking it in large quantities till it makes them sick.\r\n\r\nRobinson asked Friday if his tribe ever came to this island, and Friday\r\nsaid that they did, and that he himself had often come over; and he\r\ntold Robinson that on one visit he and his friends had eaten more than\r\ntwenty men. His tribe, he said, was very strong, and fought well. Thus\r\nthey took more prisoners, and used the island oftener than the other\r\ntribes, and it seemed that the far side of the island, where Robinson\r\nhad seen so many remains of feasts, was the part that Friday’s tribe\r\nheld as their own. Sometimes other tribes used another island for their\r\nfeasts.\r\n\r\nIt troubled Robinson’s mind greatly to hear what Friday had to say\r\nabout this custom, but by little and little, as the weeks went past,\r\nhe got him to see how horrible a thing it was to eat human flesh. From\r\nthis beginning, Friday gradually came to be in his habits more like\r\na white man, and teaching him was a great joy to Robinson, who found\r\nthe years after Friday’s arrival the happiest of all that he had lived\r\non the island. Not only had he now help in his work, but he had some\r\none to talk to, for want of which, during the weary years when he was\r\nalone, he had almost forgotten his own tongue.\r\n\r\nWhen they began easily to understand each other, Robinson asked Friday\r\nhow far it was from the island to his country, and if the canoes were\r\nnot often lost whilst crossing. Friday said there was no danger, and\r\nthat no canoes were ever wrecked; that always in the morning the\r\nwind and the current set one way, and the other in the afternoon.\r\nThis Robinson thought must have something to do with the tides, but\r\nafterwards he learned that the change of wind was only the difference\r\nbetween the sea breeze and the land breeze, which blow time about,\r\nmorning and evening, in those parts. The change in the current was due\r\nto the in-draft and out-draft of a great river, off whose mouth the\r\nisland lay.\r\n\r\nFriday told Robinson much about his country, and about his people, who\r\nhe said were Caribs. And a great way ‘beyond the moon,’ by which he\r\nmeant to the west, he said that white men lived who had beards such as\r\nRobinson wore. These white men, he said, had killed very many natives,\r\nfrom which Robinson fancied that they must be Spaniards, who about that\r\ntime were very cruel to the people whose countries they had taken.\r\n\r\nRobinson asked if Friday could tell him how he might get over to where\r\nthe white men lived, and Friday said it would be very easy, if they\r\nhad a big canoe. And again Robinson began to make plans and to hope to\r\nescape from the island. He showed Friday the boat in which he and the\r\ncrew had tried to land from the wreck, the remains of which still lay\r\nhigh up on the shore, out of reach of the waves of any but a very high\r\ntide, or of a storm worse than common. Friday looked long at it without\r\nspeaking, till Robinson asked what he was thinking of.\r\n\r\nThen he said that he had once before seen such a boat, but for some\r\ntime he could not make Robinson understand where, or when, he had seen\r\nit. Robinson thought he meant that a ship had been driven ashore on the\r\ncoast, and that the boat, perhaps, had come from her. But presently\r\nFriday spoke of the men who had been in the boat, and whom he and his\r\npeople had pulled out of the sea. He counted on his fingers to make\r\nRobinson understand that there had been seventeen of them.\r\n\r\n‘Where are they now?’ Robinson asked; and Friday said they still lived\r\nwith his tribe.\r\n\r\nThis put new ideas into Robinson’s head, for he thought that probably\r\nthese men might have belonged to the ship whose guns he had heard, and\r\nto which he had afterwards gone out in his boat as she lay on the reef.\r\n\r\nFriday said that his people had given the men food, and had not hurt\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n‘Why did they not kill and eat them?’ asked Robinson; and again Friday\r\nassured him that they ate men only whom they took in war.\r\n\r\nIt was some time after this that Robinson and Friday chanced to be on\r\nthe high hill at the east end of the island. The day was cloudless and\r\nvery clear, with a light breeze rippling the water, just such a day as\r\nthat on which, years ago, Robinson had seen land, far over the sea.\r\nFriday gazed long in that direction, and then began to jump and dance,\r\npointing to the dim blue coast. ‘There my country! See! There my people\r\nlive!’ he said, his eyes sparkling with joy, and an eager light on his\r\nface.\r\n\r\nAfter this, for a time Robinson was not easy in his mind about Friday.\r\nHe had little doubt that if he could get back to his tribe, he would\r\nsoon forget all he had been taught, all that Robinson had done for\r\nhim, might even return, perhaps, with a hundred or two of his friends,\r\nand kill and eat his master. But in this Robinson was very unjust to\r\nFriday, who had no such thoughts in his mind as those of which he was\r\nsuspected.\r\n\r\nAnd this Robinson soon found out. One day, as they walked up the same\r\nhill, he asked if Friday would not be glad to be once more in his own\r\nland.\r\n\r\n‘Yes,’ said Friday; ‘very glad.’\r\n\r\n‘Would you eat men’s flesh again?’\r\n\r\n‘No, never,’ said Friday, shaking his head very much.\r\n\r\nThen Robinson asked why he did not go back. It was too far to swim,\r\nsaid Friday. Robinson said he would give him a boat, and Friday said,\r\nvery well, he would go if Robinson came too.\r\n\r\n‘But your people will eat me,’ said Robinson.\r\n\r\n‘No, no,’ Friday answered; ‘you good to me. They good to you.’\r\n\r\nRobinson had then more than half a mind to go, for if he could join the\r\nother white men, he thought there would be a better chance to build a\r\nboat big enough to sail in to England.\r\n\r\nSo he took Friday to the place where he kept the small canoe he had\r\nmade, and quickly he found that he was a very much better boatman than\r\nRobinson himself, and could make her go through the water nearly twice\r\nas fast as Robinson was able to do.\r\n\r\nBut when Robinson asked if they might try to go over in that boat,\r\nFriday’s face fell. She was too small, he said. Robinson then showed\r\nhim the first boat he had built, and which had been lying on the sand\r\nnow for more than twenty-two years. That, Friday said, was big enough.\r\nBut the heat of the sun by this time had so warped and cracked her\r\nthat, even if they could have got her into the sea, she would not have\r\nfloated.\r\n\r\nThen Robinson told Friday that he would build him a bigger boat, and\r\nsend him home in it, but that he himself would remain on the island\r\nalone, as he had been before.\r\n\r\nThe poor lad’s feelings were hurt at this, and he asked, ‘Why you angry\r\nmad with Friday? Suppose master go, Friday go! Suppose master no go,\r\nFriday no go!’ And he brought a hatchet, and said, ‘You kill Friday;\r\nnot send him away.’ Robinson was much touched by this devotion, and\r\nafterwards always had perfect faith in him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                   ROBINSON AND FRIDAY BUILD A LARGE\r\n                    BOAT; THEY RESCUE TWO PRISONERS\r\n                          FROM THE CANNIBALS\r\n\r\n\r\nBut still the wish to leave the island was as strong as ever, and\r\ntogether he and Friday went to work to fell a tree from which to build\r\na boat good enough for their voyage to the mainland. Friday soon showed\r\nthat he knew far better than Robinson the kind of tree best suited for\r\nboat-making, though he knew less about hollowing it out; for he had\r\nnever seen tools suitable for such work. Friday proposed to burn out\r\nthe inside, but Robinson showed him how to use the tools, and soon he\r\nwas very handy with them.\r\n\r\nIt took the two of them little more than a month to finish the boat.\r\nAnd very handsome she looked, and very proud of her they were. But\r\nit cost them quite a fortnight of very hard work to get her into the\r\nwater. Below her they had to put large wooden rollers, and then with\r\nstrong sticks, inch by inch, they levered and pushed her into the sea,\r\nwhere she floated, very trim and ship-shape, big enough to carry a\r\ndozen men.\r\n\r\nRobinson was astonished at Friday’s skill in paddling so large a canoe.\r\nShe seemed to fly through the water, and he could turn her with great\r\nease.\r\n\r\n‘Will she do to go over in?’ he asked, and Friday, grinning, said,\r\n‘Yes, even if big wind blow.’\r\n\r\nBut Robinson did not mean to depend only on paddling. He made Friday\r\ncut down a straight young pine-tree for a mast, and amongst the old\r\nship’s sails that he had kept so long he found at last two pieces that\r\nwere not rotten. From these he made what is called a shoulder-of-mutton\r\nsail, and a small foresail. It took him nearly two months to cut and\r\nfit them, but when they were finished and hoisted they acted very well,\r\nand when a clumsy rudder had been fixed to the boat, he found that she\r\nsteered nicely, and was quite safe and stiff in a fresh breeze.\r\n\r\nFriday knew nothing of sailing, and was astonished to see the boat go\r\nso fast, but he quickly learned to handle her quite as well as Robinson\r\ncould do. The only thing he could not learn was how to steer by compass.\r\n\r\nSix-and-twenty years had passed since Robinson came to the island, and\r\nthough his hope of getting away was now great, he still went on digging\r\nand sowing and fencing as usual, and picking and curing his raisins, in\r\ncase by any chance he should still have to stop where he was.\r\n\r\nAs the rainy season was nearly due, he made Friday dig near the creek\r\na kind of dock in the sand for the new boat, just deep enough for her\r\nto float in; and when the tide was low, they made a dam across the end\r\nof the dock to keep the water out. Then they covered the boat over very\r\nthickly with boughs of trees; and there she lay, quite dry and snug,\r\ntill the end of the wet weather, when it was Robinson’s plan to start\r\nfor the mainland.\r\n\r\nA week or two before the dry season again came, Robinson meant to open\r\nthe dock and get the boat afloat once more. And to be ready in plenty\r\nof time he began to lay by a lot of food and other stores for use on\r\nthe voyage.\r\n\r\nOne morning, when he was very busy over his work, he told Friday to go\r\ndown to the beach to see if he could find a turtle. Off went Friday,\r\nbut before he had been gone many minutes, back he came running in a\r\ngreat hurry, crying out ‘Master! Master! O sorrow! O bad!’\r\n\r\n‘What’s the matter, Friday?’ asked Robinson.\r\n\r\n‘Over yonder,’ said Friday, pointing to the west, and very much scared;\r\n‘over yonder, one, two, three canoe.’\r\n\r\nRobinson cheered him as well as he could.\r\n\r\n‘Well, Friday,’ said he, ‘we must fight them. Will you fight?’\r\n\r\n‘Yes, Friday shoot,’ he answered, ‘but too much great many come.’\r\n\r\n‘No matter,’ said Robinson, ‘our guns will frighten those we don’t\r\nkill.’\r\n\r\nFriday promised to stand by him to the end, and to do just as he was\r\nbid.\r\n\r\nThen Robinson loaded two guns with large swan shot, and gave them to\r\nFriday, and himself took four muskets, which he loaded carefully with\r\nfive small bullets and two slugs each, and in each of his pistols he\r\nput two bullets. Then he hung his cutlass by his side, and gave Friday\r\na hatchet.\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready, he went up the hill with his telescope, and saw\r\nthat there were in all twenty-one savages, with three prisoners. They\r\nhad landed not far beyond the creek, near a spot where thick bushes\r\ngrew almost down to the sea.\r\n\r\nGiving Friday one of the pistols to stick in his belt, and one of the\r\nmuskets to carry, they set off, each of them now armed with a pistol\r\nand three guns, besides Robinson’s cutlass and Friday’s hatchet.\r\nRobinson put in his pocket a small bottle of rum, and gave Friday a\r\nbag with more powder and bullets to carry, and told him to keep very\r\nquiet, and to be sure not to fire till Robinson gave the word.\r\n\r\nTo get at the savages without being seen, they had to go nearly a mile\r\nout of their way, and being heavily laden, they could not go very fast.\r\nDuring this walk, Robinson began to argue with himself again, and to\r\nthink that perhaps after all it was no business of his to go killing\r\nsavages who had never done him any harm, and who were only doing what\r\nthey and their people had done for hundreds of years. They knew no\r\nbetter, he said to himself, and why should he kill them? His mind\r\nwas so filled with doubts, that he did not know what to do. Finally,\r\nhe decided that he would only go near enough to see plainly what the\r\nsavages were doing, but that, unless there should be some special cause\r\nfor it, he would not attack them.\r\n\r\nWhen he and Friday got near the place where the savages had lit their\r\nfire, Robinson sent Friday forward, to see what was going on, and to\r\ncome back and tell him.\r\n\r\nFriday crept on, and returned very quickly, saying that the cannibals\r\nhad already killed one of their prisoners, and were eating him, and\r\nthat very soon they would kill the second prisoner, who was lying near\r\nto them. The second prisoner, Friday said, was a white man.\r\n\r\nThis news at once changed Robinson’s plans, and he had no longer any\r\ndoubt what to do.\r\n\r\nCreeping forward, he saw plainly through his glass the white man lying\r\nbound hand and foot on the sand. There was another tree, Robinson\r\nnoticed, with a clump of bushes round it, some distance nearer to the\r\nsavages, and within very easy shot of them. To that he and Friday now\r\ncrawled.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to lose, for when they reached the tree, two of the\r\nsavages had gone to the white man, and were untying his ankles. The\r\nother cannibals were all sitting close together.\r\n\r\nTurning to Friday, Robinson said in a low voice, ‘Now do exactly as I\r\ntell you.’ They both took aim at the crowd of savages.\r\n\r\n‘Are you ready, Friday?’ whispered Robinson.\r\n\r\n‘Ready,’ said Friday.\r\n\r\n‘Then fire!’\r\n\r\nRobinson’s first shot killed one and wounded two, but Friday’s dropped\r\ntwo dead, and three wounded. Snatching up fresh guns, both fired again\r\nbefore the savages who were not hurt could get on their feet, for they\r\nwere so taken by surprise and frightened by the noise, that the poor\r\nwretches hardly knew what was happening. This time only two dropped,\r\nbut many more were wounded by the swan shot, and ran about yelling till\r\nthey fell from loss of blood.\r\n\r\n‘Now, Friday,’ said Robinson, taking up one of the remaining loaded\r\nmuskets, ‘follow me.’ And he rushed out of the wood, with Friday close\r\nbehind, and charged down on the cannibals as fast as he could run.\r\n\r\nThe two men who had gone to kill the white prisoner no sooner saw this\r\nthan they fled to the canoes, and three of the others followed, and\r\njumped into the same canoe.\r\n\r\nRobinson bade Friday shoot at them, and Friday, running forward, fired.\r\nAll the men in the canoe fell, two of them dead and one wounded. The\r\nothers seemed to fall from fear, for they soon jumped up and paddled\r\naway with all their might.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Robinson ran to the white prisoner and cut his bonds]\r\n\r\nWhilst Friday kept on firing, Robinson ran to the white prisoner and\r\ncut his bonds, helping him on to his feet, and giving him some rum from\r\nthe bottle he had brought. The man, on being asked what countryman he\r\nwas, answered that he was a Spaniard, and he began to thank Robinson\r\nfor what he had done. But Robinson, who could speak a little Spanish,\r\nstopped him, saying, ‘Señor, we will talk afterwards. At present we\r\nmust fight.’ And he gave the Spaniard the cutlass from his belt and a\r\npistol, telling him, if he had strength left, to go and do what he\r\ncould against the savages.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the man got the weapons in his hands, he ran with fury\r\nat the cannibals and cut two down, then turned, and with equal fury\r\nattacked the rest.\r\n\r\nRobinson now sent Friday for the muskets which had been left under the\r\ntree, and began quickly to reload them, giving Friday the musket which\r\nhe himself had been carrying, but which he had not fired.\r\n\r\nMeantime the Spaniard had attacked a very big, powerful savage who was\r\narmed with a club, and though with his cutlass he had twice wounded\r\nthe cannibal in the head, yet from being bound so long the white man\r\nwas weak, and now looked like getting the worst of it. For the savage,\r\nmaking a rush, closed with him and threw him, and in the struggle had\r\nnearly wrenched the cutlass out of his hand, when the Spaniard suddenly\r\nquitting his hold, drew his pistol and shot the man through the body,\r\nkilling him on the spot.\r\n\r\nThe other natives were now scattered in every direction, and Friday,\r\nrunning after them with his hatchet, killed all of them except one who\r\nhad been wounded by the Spaniard, and who, in spite of his wounds,\r\njumped into the sea and swam out to the canoe in which were the two\r\nothers who had got away.\r\n\r\nFriday advised Robinson to take another of the canoes and go after\r\nthem; and Robinson agreed, for he thought that if any escaped they\r\nwould be certain to come back, bringing hundreds of others to avenge\r\nthe death of their friends. So the two ran to the beach and began to\r\nshove off a canoe. But to their surprise, on the bottom of the canoe\r\nlay another prisoner, an old man, tied so hard, neck and heels, that\r\neven when his bonds were cut he could not move. He groaned and lay\r\nstill, perhaps thinking that he was only being untied to be killed.\r\n\r\nRobinson handed the rum to Friday and told him to pour some down the\r\npoor man’s throat, which seemed to revive him, for he sat up.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did Friday look at him and hear him speak, than he began\r\nto dance and shout and laugh, and then kneeling down, rubbed noses\r\nwith the savage (which is what these folks do instead of kissing each\r\nother), and he was so excited that for some time he could not explain\r\nwhat was the matter. As soon as he could speak, he told Robinson that\r\nthe man whom they had found was his father. The poor creature’s wrists\r\nand ankles were chafed and stiff from being so long bound, and he was\r\nparched with thirst.\r\n\r\nFriday ran and fetched water for him, and then with rum rubbed his\r\nfather’s wrists and ankles. Those of the Spaniard also were so\r\ndreadfully cut and swollen, and he was so worn out with fighting, that\r\nFriday had to carry him on his back to the canoe. Then he paddled the\r\ntwo men along to the creek, whilst Robinson walked. But both men had to\r\nbe carried up to the castle, and Robinson was forced to rig up a tent\r\nfor them outside, because it was not possible for him and Friday to\r\nlift them over the fence.\r\n\r\nThe next day Robinson sent Friday to bury the bodies of the savages who\r\nhad been killed, and to bring in the muskets.\r\n\r\nWhen that was done, he made Friday ask his father if he thought the\r\nsavages were likely to come back. The man said that he thought they\r\nwere so frightened by the way they had been attacked, and by the noise\r\nof the guns and the fire and smoke coming from them, that they would\r\nprobably never return. He said he had heard them call out that two evil\r\nspirits were attacking them. And it turned out that the old man was\r\nright, for no cannibals were ever again known to visit this island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                      ARRIVAL OF AN ENGLISH SHIP;\r\n                        ROBINSON SAILS FOR HOME\r\n\r\n\r\nSoon after this Robinson had a long talk with the Spaniard, who told\r\nhim how he and his comrades had been wrecked four years since, on that\r\npart of the coast where Friday’s tribe lived. He said that they were\r\nwell treated by the natives, but that they were put to very great\r\nstraits now for want of clothes, that their powder was finished, and\r\nthat they had lost all hope of ever getting back to their own country.\r\nHe himself, he said, had been captured in one of the many small wars\r\nthat are always taking place among the various tribes.\r\n\r\nIt struck Robinson that it might be possible for him to get these men\r\nover to his island, provided that he could be sure of their good\r\nfaith, and that when they came, they did not take the island from him\r\nby treachery. It was a risk, he thought, but then, if he got so many\r\nmen, it would not be difficult to build a small ship that could carry\r\nthem all to England.\r\n\r\nSo he asked the Spaniard if he would promise, and if he thought he\r\ncould get his comrades to take an oath that, if Robinson helped them,\r\nthey would look on him as their captain, and would swear to obey him in\r\nall things. The Spaniard readily promised for himself, and said that he\r\nwas sure his comrades would keep faith.\r\n\r\nIt was arranged, therefore, that in about six months, when the next\r\nharvest was reaped, and there would be plenty of food for so many extra\r\nmen, the Spaniard and Friday’s father should go over to the mainland in\r\none of the canoes which had been taken from the savages.\r\n\r\nMeantime, all hands set about the curing of very large quantities of\r\nraisins, and much other work was done to be in readiness for the\r\ncoming of these men.\r\n\r\nWhen the harvest was reaped, Robinson gave the Spaniard and Friday’s\r\nfather each a musket and a supply of powder and bullets, and loaded the\r\ncanoe with food, enough to last them and the others about a fortnight,\r\nand the two men set off for the mainland in fine weather, and with a\r\nfair wind.\r\n\r\nIt was about eight days after this, and when Robinson had begun to look\r\nout for their return, that one morning very early, when Robinson was\r\nasleep, Friday came running in, shouting, ‘Master! master! They come.’\r\nUp jumped Robinson, and hurrying on his clothes, ran out.\r\n\r\nLooking towards the sea, he soon made out a sailing-boat making for\r\nthe shore, coming from the south end of the island, but still some\r\nmiles away. This was not the direction from which the Spaniard and his\r\ncomrades would come, nor were they likely to be in a sailing-boat. So\r\nRobinson took his telescope, and went to the top of the hill to see if\r\nhe could make out who were on board, before they landed.\r\n\r\nHardly had he got on to the hill when he noticed a ship at anchor some\r\ndistance from the shore. She looked like an English vessel, he thought,\r\nand the boat like an English long-boat.\r\n\r\nThis was a wonderful sight to Robinson, but yet he was not easy in his\r\nmind. It was not a part of the world where an English ship was likely\r\nto come, because in those days they were nearly all Spanish vessels\r\nthat traded in these seas, and the English and Spaniards were bitter\r\nenemies. What could an English ship be doing here? There had been no\r\nstorm to drive her out of her course.\r\n\r\nRobinson feared that if she was English there must be something wrong\r\nabout her. Perhaps, he thought, she was a Pirate. So he was careful not\r\nto show himself or Friday.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: What could an English ship be doing here?]\r\n\r\nPresently, as he watched, he saw the men in the boat run her ashore\r\nand draw her up on the beach, about half a mile from his castle. When\r\nthey had landed, he could easily see through his glass that they were\r\nEnglishmen.\r\n\r\nThere were eleven men, but three of them had their hands tied behind\r\ntheir backs, and were evidently prisoners. When the first four or\r\nfive men had jumped ashore, they brought out these three, all the\r\nwhile ill-treating them, and behaving as if they meant to kill their\r\nprisoners. Friday was sure that they meant to eat them.\r\n\r\nSoon, without further harming the three men, the others scattered about\r\namongst the trees near the shore, leaving the three sitting on the\r\nground, very sad-looking, but with their hands now untied.\r\n\r\nAt the time the boat was run aground, it was just high-water, and the\r\ntwo sailors who had been left in charge of her, and who had evidently\r\nbeen drinking too much rum, went to sleep, and never noticed that\r\nthe tide was going out. When they woke, the boat was high and dry,\r\nand with all the strength of the whole crew they could not move her,\r\nbecause the sand at that part of the beach was very soft. This did not\r\nseem to trouble any of them very much, for Robinson heard one of the\r\nsailors shout, ‘Let her alone, Jack, can’t ye? She’ll float next tide.’\r\n\r\nAll forenoon Robinson watched, and when the hottest time of the day had\r\ncome, he noticed the sailors throw themselves down under the trees, and\r\ngo to sleep, some distance away from the three prisoners.\r\n\r\nThen Robinson and Friday, taking their muskets and pistols, stole down\r\ncautiously behind the three men, to try to speak to them without the\r\nothers knowing.\r\n\r\nRobinson had put on his goat-skin coat and the great hairy hat that he\r\nhad made for himself; and with his cutlass and pistols in his belt, and\r\na gun over each shoulder, he looked very fierce.\r\n\r\nThe men did not see him till he spoke, and they were so startled by his\r\nwild look, and by the sight of two men armed to the teeth, that they\r\nnearly ran away. But Robinson told them not to be alarmed; he was an\r\nEnglishman, and a friend, and would help them if they would show him\r\nhow it could be done.\r\n\r\nThen they explained to him what had happened. One of the three was\r\nCaptain of the ship that lay at anchor off the island. Of the others,\r\none was mate of the ship, and the third man was a passenger. The crew\r\nhad mutinied, the Captain told Robinson, and had put him and the other\r\ntwo in irons, and the ring-leaders in the mutiny had proposed to kill\r\nthem. Now they meant to leave them on the island to perish.\r\n\r\nThe Captain was so astonished at finding anybody there who proposed to\r\nhelp him, that he said in his wonder: ‘Am I talking to a man, or to an\r\nangel from heaven?’\r\n\r\n‘If the Lord had sent an angel, sir,’ said Robinson, ‘he would probably\r\nhave come better clothed.’\r\n\r\nThen he asked if the boat’s crew had any firearms, and was told that\r\nthey had only two muskets, one of which was left in the boat. ‘The rest\r\nshould be easy, then,’ Robinson said; ‘we can either kill them all, or\r\ntake them prisoners, as we please.’\r\n\r\nThe Captain was unwilling to see the men killed, for he said if two of\r\nthe worst of them were got rid of, he believed the rest would return to\r\ntheir duty.\r\n\r\nRobinson made a bargain that if he saved the Captain from the\r\nmutineers, and recovered the ship, he and Friday were to be taken home\r\nto England in her, free of cost; and to this the Captain and the others\r\nagreed.\r\n\r\nThen Robinson gave each of them a musket, with powder and ball, after\r\nwhich the Captain and the mate and the passenger marched towards the\r\nspot where the mutinous sailors lay asleep. One of the men heard them\r\nadvance, and turning round, saw them, and cried out to his companions.\r\nBut it was too late, the mate and the passenger fired, and one of\r\nthe ring-leaders fell dead. A second man also fell, but jumped up\r\nimmediately and called to the others to help him. But the Captain\r\nknocked him down with the butt of his musket, and the rest of the men,\r\nseeing Robinson and Friday coming, and knowing that they had no chance\r\nagainst five armed men, begged for mercy. Three others who had been\r\nstraying about among the trees came back on hearing the shots, and were\r\nalso taken, and thus the whole crew of the boat was captured.\r\n\r\nThe Captain and Robinson now began to think how they might recover the\r\nship. There were on board, the Captain said, several men on whom he\r\nthought he could depend, and who had been forced by the others into the\r\nmutiny against their wills. But it would be no easy thing to retake the\r\nship, for there were still twenty-six men on board, and as they were\r\nguilty of mutiny, all of them, if taken back to England, would most\r\nlikely be hanged. Thus they were certain to make a fight for it.\r\n\r\nThe first thing that Robinson and the others now did was to take\r\neverything out of the boat,--oars, and mast, and sail, and rudder; then\r\nthey knocked a hole in her bottom, so that she could not float. Whilst\r\nthey were doing this, and drawing her still further up on the beach,\r\nthey heard first one gun and then another fired by the ship as signals\r\nto the boat to return.\r\n\r\nAs she of course did not move, Robinson saw through his glass another\r\nboat with ten men on board, armed with muskets, leave the ship, coming\r\nto bring the others back.\r\n\r\nThis was serious enough, for now Robinson and his party had to make\r\nplans whereby they might capture also this fresh boat’s crew.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, they tied the hands of all the men they had first taken,\r\nand sent the worst of them to the cave under the charge of Friday and\r\nof one of the men that the Captain said was to be trusted, with orders\r\nto shoot any who tried to give an alarm or to escape. Then Robinson\r\ntook his party and the rest of the prisoners into the castle, where,\r\nfrom the rock, they watched for the landing of the second boat.\r\n\r\nThe Captain and mate were very nervous, and despaired of taking this\r\nfresh body of men, but Robinson was quite confident of success, and put\r\nheart into them by his cheerfulness.\r\n\r\nOf the prisoners in his castle, there were two whom the Captain\r\nbelieved to be honest men, and on their promising solemnly to keep\r\nfaith, and to fight for him, Robinson released them.\r\n\r\nThe crew of the second boat, when they landed, were terribly surprised\r\nto find the first boat empty and stove in, and they were seen anxiously\r\nconsulting what to do. Then they hallooed and fired volleys. Getting\r\nno reply, they were evidently alarmed, for they all jumped into their\r\nboat and began to pull off to the ship. In a few minutes, however, they\r\nseemed to change their minds, for again they landed, this time leaving\r\nthree men in charge of the boat, and keeping her in the water.\r\n\r\nThe other seven came ashore, and started in a body across the island to\r\nlook for their lost comrades. But they did not care to go far, and soon\r\nstopped, again firing volleys and hallooing. Getting again no reply,\r\nthey began to march back to the sea. Whereupon Robinson ordered Friday\r\nand the mate to go over the creek to the west and halloo loudly, and\r\nwait till the sailors answered. Then Friday and the mate were to go\r\nfurther away and again halloo, thus gradually getting the men to follow\r\nthem away from the shore.\r\n\r\nThis plan succeeded very well, for when the sailors, thinking they\r\nheard their missing friends hail, ran to find them, their way was\r\nstopped by the creek, over which they had to get the boat to carry\r\nthem. They took with them, then, one of the three men whom they had\r\nleft in the boat, and ordered the others to moor the boat to a tree,\r\nand remain there.\r\n\r\nThis was just what Robinson wanted. And, moreover, one of the men\r\nplayed still further into his hands, for he left the boat and lay down\r\nunder a tree to sleep. On him the Captain rushed, and knocked him down\r\nas he tried to rise to his feet, whereupon the sailor left in the\r\nboat yielded, the more readily that he had joined the mutineers very\r\nunwillingly, and was now glad of the chance to rejoin his Captain.\r\n\r\nMeantime Friday and the mate, by hallooing and answering, drew the rest\r\nof the boat’s crew from hill to hill through the woods, till at last\r\nthey had got them so far astray that it was not possible for them to\r\nfind their way back before dark. When they did get back to where the\r\nboat had been left, and found the men whom they had left in her gone,\r\nthey were in a terrible fright.\r\n\r\nIt was not difficult for Robinson and his men to surround them, and it\r\nchanced that the boatswain of the ship, who was the greatest villain of\r\nthe lot, and the chief cause of all the trouble, walked in the darkness\r\nclose to the Captain, who jumped up and shot him dead. The others then\r\nsurrendered, believing what they were told, that they were surrounded\r\nby fifty armed men. All begged hard for their lives, and a few whom the\r\nCaptain said he could trust were set at liberty on promising to help to\r\nretake the ship. The others were bound and put in the cave.\r\n\r\nRobinson and Friday remained on shore to look after the prisoners,\r\nwhilst the Captain and the mate and the passenger, with those of the\r\ncrew who were trustworthy, having patched up the damaged boat, pulled\r\noff in her and in the other to the ship, which they reached about\r\nmidnight. When they were a short distance off, the Captain made one of\r\nthe crew hail the ship and say that they had brought off the boat and\r\nthe men they had gone in search of. Then both boats ran alongside at\r\nonce, one on each side of the vessel, and before the mutineers knew\r\nwhat was happening they were overpowered, one or two of them being\r\nkilled. Only one of the Captain’s party was hurt, the mate, whose arm\r\nwas broken by a musket-ball.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the ship was secured, the captain ordered seven guns to be\r\nfired, that being the signal he had agreed to make to let Robinson\r\nknow if he succeeded in taking the ship.\r\n\r\nRobinson’s stay in the island had now come to an end, after more than\r\ntwenty-eight years, for in a few days he and Friday sailed for England\r\nin the ship. Some of the mutineers were left on the island, and were\r\nafterwards joined by the Spaniard and his comrades, for whom Robinson\r\nleft a letter.\r\n\r\nRobinson did not forget, when he left, to take with him the money and\r\ngold bars he had got from the wreck of the Spanish ship, and he took\r\nalso, as a memento, the goat-skin coat and the great hairy hat. But the\r\nCaptain was able before the ship sailed to give him proper clothing,\r\nthe wearing of which at first put him to dreadful discomfort.\r\n\r\nThe voyage was a long one, but they sighted the English coast at last.\r\n\r\nIt was thirty-five years since Robinson had set foot in England. And\r\nthat morning, when at last, after the weary years of exile, he again\r\nsaw his native land, he laid his head down on his arms and cried like\r\na child.\r\n\r\nAnd, may be, you too some day may know the joy of coming home, out of\r\nthe land of bondage.\r\n\r\n              Edinburgh: Printed by T. and A.
