In the\r\nstudy and practice of taxidermy for several years I have failed to find\r\nany work written primarily for these every day nature lovers, though\r\nthey probably handle a greater number of interesting specimens of animal\r\nlife than all other classes of people.\r\n\r\nIn view of this fact the following directions and suggestions for\r\npreserving various animal forms as objects of use and ornament have been\r\nprepared. As a treatise for the scientist or museum preparator it is not\r\nintended, there are many books on the art expressly for them, but we\r\nhope it may fill a place of its own, acting as a not too dry and\r\ntechnical introduction to the art preservative for those who find life\r\nall too short for the many things which are to be done.\r\n\r\nThoroughness, patience, and some love for nature, are qualities highly\r\ndesirable in this art. Work prepared by one possessing these qualities\r\nneed not be ashamed and practice will bring skill and perfection of\r\ntechnic.\r\n\r\nAs a handicraft in which the workman has not been displaced or made\r\nsecondary by a machine taxidermy is noticeable also, and for many\r\nreasons is worthy of its corner in the home work-shop.\r\n\r\nIn this work also the ladies can take a very effective hand, and numbers\r\nhave done so; for there is no doubt that a woman's taste and lightness\r\nof touch enables her in some branches of taxidermy to far exceed the\r\naverage man. Especially in the manipulation of frail skins and delicate\r\nfeathers, in bird taxidermy, is this so.\r\n\r\nI have endeavored to give preference to short cuts and time-saving\r\nmethods where possible in the following matter, and especially hints on\r\nsaving interesting and valuable specimens temporarily until sufficient\r\nleisure is had to do justice to their further preservation. In this\r\nconnection I have given prominence to the liquid preservative for entire\r\nspecimens and the methods for preserving skins of birds and animals in a\r\ndamp and relaxed state ready for mounting at the operator's pleasure.\r\n\r\nI would urge the beginner especially, to mount all his specimens as far\r\nas possible. Dry scientific skins have their value, perhaps, to the\r\nmuseum or closet naturalist whose chief delight is in multiplying\r\nspecies, but a well mounted skin is a pleasure to all who may see it.\r\nMaking it a rule to utilize thus all specimens which come to hand would\r\nalso deter much thoughtless killing in the ranks of the country's\r\nalready depleted wild life.\r\n\r\nMake this a rule and you will avoid friction and show yourself truly a\r\nconservationist with the best. In a number of states there are legal\r\nrestrictions in the way of a license tax imposed on the professional\r\ntaxidermist. Detailed information of these are found in Game, Fur and\r\nFish Laws of the various states and Canadian provinces. Fur and game\r\nanimals and birds killed legally during open season may be preserved by\r\nthe taker for private possession without hindrance anywhere, I think.\r\nMore explicit details may be had on application to your state fish and\r\ngame commissioner or warden.\r\n\r\n[Signature: Albert B. Farnham.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHome Taxidermy for Pleasure and Profit\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nHISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very evident that this art--Taxidermy, preservation or care of\r\nskins--had its origin far back before the dawn of written history. There\r\nexisted then as now the desire to preserve the trophy of the hunter's\r\nprowess and skill and the unusual in natural objects.\r\n\r\nAs far back as five centuries B. C. in the record of the African\r\nexplorations of Hanno the Carthaginian, an account is given of the\r\ndiscovery of what was evidently the gorilla and the subsequent\r\npreservation of their skins, which were, on the return of the voyagers,\r\nhung in the temple of Astarte, where they remained until the taking of\r\nCarthage in the year 146 B. C.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, was not the art as we know it now, but shows the\r\nbeginnings of what might be called the museum idea. The art of embalming\r\nas practiced by the ancient Egyptians was, however, effective, not for\r\nthe purpose of having the specimens look natural, or for exhibition, but\r\nto satisfy the superstition of the times, and though a preservative art,\r\nhardly to be classed with taxidermy.\r\n\r\nIn the tombs of that period are found besides the mummies of human\r\nbeings, countless others of dogs, cats, monkeys, birds, sheep and oxen.\r\nThere have been a number of efforts made to substitute some form of\r\nembalming for present day taxidermy but without much success, for though\r\nthe body of the specimen may be preserved from decay without removing it\r\nfrom the skin, the subsequent shrinkage and distortion spoil any effect\r\nwhich may have been achieved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AN EARLY DAY SPECIMEN.]\r\n\r\nThe first attempt at stuffing and mounting birds was said to have been\r\nmade in Amsterdam in the beginning of the 16th century. The oldest\r\nmuseum specimen in existence, as far as I know, is a rhinoceros in the\r\nRoyal Museum of Vertebrates in Florence, Italy, said to have been\r\noriginally mounted in the 16th century.\r\n\r\nProbably on account of the necessary knowledge of preservative\r\nchemicals, the art seems to have been in the hands of chemists and\r\nastrologers, chiefly, during the middle ages, and stuffed animals such\r\nas bats, crocodiles, frogs, snakes, lizards, owls, etc., figure in\r\nliterary descriptions of their abodes. Then as now also, the dining\r\nhalls of the nobles and wealthy were decorated with heads and horns\r\nprocured in the hunt.\r\n\r\nThe first publications on the art seem to have been made in France, in\r\nwhich country and Germany, many still used methods and formulas\r\noriginated. Though the first volume of instruction in taxidermy was\r\npublished in the United States as late as 1865, it has been left for the\r\nstudy and ingenuity of American taxidermists to accomplish what is\r\nprobably work of as high a standard as any in the world.\r\n\r\nThe Ward establishment at Rochester has turned out many well trained\r\ntaxidermists, the large museums of the United States are filled with\r\nsome of the best work of the kind in existence, besides many persons who\r\nhave engaged in it for commercial purposes or to gratify private tastes.\r\nMany of these have made public their methods and modes in various\r\npublications. Among these are the works of Batty, Hornaday, Shofeldt,\r\nDavie, Rowley, Maynard, Reed and others, all of which are invaluable\r\nbooks of reference for the home taxidermist.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that the once flourishing Society of American\r\nTaxidermists has not been perpetuated, numbering, as it did, among its\r\nmembership the best artists in their line in this country.\r\n\r\nThere is no royal road to success in this, more than any other of the\r\narts and sciences, though I believe the ambitious beginner will find the\r\nway smoother; better materials are to be had, more helpful publications\r\nto be consulted and the lessening supply of wild life tends to make a\r\nmore appreciative public than ever before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nOUTFIT--TOOLS AND MATERIALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe extent and variety of work undertaken will determine the necessary\r\nworking space and the assortment of tools needful. Other things being\r\nequal, the most complete assortment of tools and supplies makes possible\r\nthe production of the best work in the minimum time. The equipment of\r\nthe beginner need be but small and inexpensive, however, increasing the\r\nsame as he discovers what is most necessary and desirable, in an\r\nincreasing field of work. Wonderful pieces of taxidermy have been done\r\nwith a pocket knife, pliers, needle and thread, some wire, tow and\r\narsenic.\r\n\r\nIf no other room offers, much may be achieved (with the permission of\r\nthe lady of the house) in a corner of a dining room or kitchen. A room\r\nor part of one well lighted, by north window or sky-light preferably,\r\nmakes the best location for the work table. This table may be of the\r\ncommon unpainted kitchen variety for all small work. It is well to make\r\nthe top double by hinging on two leaves, which when extended will make\r\nit twice its usual width. When so extended and supported by swinging\r\nbrackets it is specially adapted to sewing on rugs and robes. Such\r\ntables usually have one or two shallow drawers which are most useful to\r\nhold small tools. A shelf should be fitted between the legs, six or\r\neight inches from the floor, forming a handy place for boxes of\r\nmaterials, books, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WORK TABLE-SUPPLIES ON LOWER SHELF, TOOLS, ETC. ON WALL.]\r\n\r\nIf large work is in prospect a table should be built of the usual\r\nheighth, two or three feet wide, and six long. The legs of stout\r\nscantlings should be fitted with casters, making it easy to remove it to\r\nthe center of the room where it can be approached on all sides, as will\r\noften be necessary. The double top, drawers, and shelf should be a part\r\nof the larger table also. Usually the table is kept in front of the\r\nwindow with tool racks and shelves for small articles each side of the\r\nsame where they can easily be reached.\r\n\r\nFor preparing and mounting all small and medium size specimens I would\r\nadvise the following list of tools. They will enable the worker to care\r\nfor any of our native birds, quadrupeds up to the coyote, and any of our\r\ngame heads, fur rugs, etc.\r\n\r\n    1 small skinning knife\r\n    1 medium skinning knife\r\n    1 larger skinning knife\r\n    1 pair scissors, fine points\r\n    1 pair shears, heavy, short\r\n    2 pairs flat nose pliers, large and small.\r\n    1 pair side or end cutters\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOME MADE TOOLS.\r\n\r\n(1) Skin Scraper (made from screw driver) (2) (3) (4) Modeling Tools\r\n(wood and brass) (5) Setting Needle. (6) (7) Stuffers (heavy wire.)]\r\n\r\n    1 pair fine forceps, 5 or 6 inch\r\n    2 flat files, large and small\r\n    1 adjustable tool handle, assorted tools, awls.\r\n    2 pinking irons, 3/4 and 1-1/2 inch\r\n    Needles, assortment of cloth and glovers\r\n    Oilstone\r\n\r\nIf it is capable of taking and holding a good edge the small blade of a\r\npocket knife is equal to a surgeon's scalpel and a sharp shoe or paring\r\nknife, ground to the proper shape, is a nice medium size for skinning or\r\ntrimming skins. A hunting or butcher knife is sufficient for the largest\r\nsize. A few carpenter's tools are necessary and a complete set does not\r\ncome amiss if much large work is attempted.\r\n\r\nWe must have:\r\n\r\n    Handsaw\r\n    Hatchet\r\n    Hammer\r\n    Bit brace\r\n    Assortment, drills and bits, 1/2 in. and less.\r\n    Drawshave\r\n    Screwdriver\r\n    Small grindstone or corundum wheel\r\n    Chisels, two or three sizes\r\n    1 wood rasp\r\n    1 cabinet rasp\r\n    1 chopping block, made of a section of\r\n      hardwood log\r\n\r\nIf large animals are to be mounted we will need in addition some iron\r\nworking tools, such as\r\n\r\n    Set of taps and dies 1/4 to 1 in.\r\n    Monkey wrench\r\n    Hack saw\r\n    Tanner's knives, 1 or more\r\n\r\nA combination vise and anvil will be needed in any case as well as some\r\nmiscellaneous tools:\r\n\r\n    Fur comb, coarse and fine combined\r\n    Paint, wax, and varnish brushes\r\n    Foot rule\r\n    Tape measure\r\n    Putty knife\r\n    Pointing trowel\r\n    Skin scraper\r\n\r\nand some stuffing and modelling tools which you can make yourself. The\r\nlist of materials seems like a long one, but many are inexpensive and\r\nothers are used only in some small amounts, so the aggregate cost is\r\nsmall.\r\n\r\n    Excelsior\r\n    Fine tow\r\n    Cotton bat or wadding\r\n    Plaster paris\r\n    Corn meal\r\n    Gasoline\r\n    Potter's or modelling clay\r\n    Set tube oil colors\r\n    Glass eyes, assorted\r\n    Soft wire, assorted\r\n    Pins\r\n    Cord\r\n    Spool cotton, coarse and fine, black and white\r\n    Wax, varnish, glue, paste\r\n    Papier mache, or paper for same\r\n    An assortment of nails, tacks, brads, screws,\r\n      screw eyes and staples\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAXIDERMISTS TOOLS.\r\n\r\n(1) Gimlet (2) Expansive bits (3) Brush (4) Bone cutter (5) (6) (7) (8)\r\nPliers (9) Pinking irons (10) Hand vise (11) (12) Scalpels and knives.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAXIDERMISTS TOOLS.\r\n\r\n(13) Scalpels (15) Sewing palm (16) Straight Surgeons Scissors (17)\r\nCurved Surgeon Scissors (18) Angular Surgeons Scissors (19) Fine Point\r\nScissors (20) Scissor Handled Stuffers (21) Stuffer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAXIDERMISTS TOOLS.\r\n\r\n(22) Stuffer and forcep, curved fine point (23) Regular taxidermists\r\nstuffer and forcep (24) Gauge (25) Hack Saw (26) Egg drill]\r\n\r\nA packing box or two will furnish some lumber for temporary stands and\r\ninterior frame work. The permanent mounts are treated of elsewhere.\r\n\r\nIn ordering glass eyes it is often best to get them in the clear glass\r\niris with black pupil so they may be given any color desired by painting\r\nthe backs with tube colors, afterward protecting the paint with varnish.\r\nIn this way a small stock will answer for many varieties. The plain\r\nblack eye which is the least expensive can be used for many of the\r\nsmaller birds and mammals, but should never be when the iris of the eye\r\nhas any distinct tint. Do not make the mistake of ordering an assortment\r\nof \"off\" sizes and colors, that is those which are seldom called for.\r\nAim to have those on hand for which you will have the most frequent use,\r\nthe exceptions can be quickly had by parcel post. There is more demand\r\nfor eyes of some shade of yellow or brown than any other colors,\r\nprobably.\r\n\r\nAll birds have the round pupil. Elongated pupils are suitable for horned\r\ngame and the cat tribe, irregular pupils fish, and the veined iris for\r\ndogs, wolves and foxes. Suitable sizes for some species of birds are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  Number  3 to  5   Sparrows generally.\r\n  Number  5 to  7   Robin, blue jay, flicker.\r\n  Number  7 to  9   The smaller hawks and herons,\r\n                    nearly all the ducks.\r\n  Number 10 to 12   The smaller owls, the wild goose.\r\n  Number 12 to 14   The larger hawks and herons.\r\n  Number 15         Screech owl, eagles.\r\n  Number 17         Barred owl.\r\n  Number 19 or 20   Snowy owl and great horned owl.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GLASS EYES FOR ANIMALS, BIRDS, FISH.]\r\n\r\nSize of eyes for quadrupeds:\r\n\r\n  Number  7 or  8   Mink, skunk, red squirrel.\r\n  Number 10 to 12   Gray and fox squirrel, wood\r\n                    chuck, raccoon and opossum.\r\n  Number 12 to 14   Rabbit, small dogs, house cat.\r\n  Number 15 to 17   Jack rabbit, fox, medium size\r\n                    dogs, wild cat, black bear.\r\n  Number 18         Large dog, wolf, lynx, and grizzly bear.\r\n  Number 20 to 22   Puma, jaguar, small deer.\r\n  Number 23 to 24   Large deer, tiger.\r\n  Number 25 to 27   Moose, elk, caribou, horse, cow, lion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIZES OF GLASS EYES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIZES OF GLASS EYES (Style 1)]\r\n\r\nOf wire the following sizes are suitable for\r\nbirds:\r\n\r\n  Number  6         Pelican.\r\n  Number  7         Wild turkey, swan.\r\n  Number  8         Eagles.\r\n  Number  9         Loon, goose, large herons.\r\n  Number 10         Seagull, large ducks, hawks,\r\n                    owls, and fish hawk.\r\n  Number 11 or 12   Medium size ducks, herons, and similar.\r\n  Number 13 or 14   Small ducks and grouse.\r\n  Number 15         Small herons, and medium owls.\r\n  Number 16         Doves, small owls.\r\n  Number 17 or 18   Bob white, jay, robin, snipe.\r\n  Number 19         Blackbird, waxwing, oriole.\r\n  Number 20         Bluebird, cardinal.\r\n  Number 21 to 24   Warblers, wrens, titmouse, finches.\r\n  Number 26         North American humming bird.\r\n\r\nFor quadrupeds:\r\n\r\n  Number  7         Wild cat.\r\n  Number  8         Foxes.\r\n  Number 10         Raccoon, wood chuck.\r\n  Number 11         Skunk, opossum.\r\n  Number 12 or 13   Muskrat, rabbit.\r\n  Number 14 or 15   Mink, large squirrels.\r\n  Number 17 or 18   Weasel, bull frog, and small squirrels.\r\n\r\nThese sizes are approximate, varying with size of the individual\r\nspecimen and the required attitude wanted. For instance, a bird mounted\r\nwith wings spread would be better for a large size wire than if in a\r\nresting position. An animal crouched does not require as heavy supports\r\nas one upright or in action. It is best to give the specimen the benefit\r\nof the doubt, as nothing is more disastrous than to have an otherwise\r\nwell mounted subject sag down and spoil the entire effect from lack of\r\nsufficient mechanical support. The best wire for this purpose is\r\nannealed, galvanized iron. Larger animals require Norway iron rod in the\r\nfollowing sizes:\r\n\r\n    1/4 in.   Coyote, setter dog.\r\n   5/16 in.   Wolf, puma.\r\n    3/8 in.   Medium deer.\r\n    1/2 in.   Caribou and large deer.\r\n    3/4 in.   Moose, elk.\r\n\r\nA large earthen jar or two will hold sufficient skin pickle for small\r\nanimals. For large animals or great numbers of small ones a tank or\r\nbarrel. Keep such jars or barrels covered to prevent evaporation. With\r\ndry arsenic and alum, arsenical solution, formaldehyde for an emergency\r\nand plenty of salt, even a beginner should be able to save almost\r\nanything that falls into his clutches.\r\n\r\nThere are numbers of reliable dealers in tools and supplies for the\r\ntaxidermist and a perusal of their catalogs will be helpful, among the\r\nnumber being James P. Babbitt, 192 Hodges Ave., Taunton, Mass. Ready to\r\nuse head forms, pinked rug and robe trimming, artificial tongues and ear\r\nforms, and even paper head and neck forms for the mounting of large game\r\nheads are some of the time and labor saving supplies they list. If you\r\ncannot attain to these, emergency supplies can be had of the dealer in\r\nhardware and dry goods, and one who cares for the art will rise superior\r\nto the material at his hand. What you \"stuff 'em with\" is of small\r\nconsequence provided you use brains in the job. I have seen an elk head\r\nstuffed with old clothes with the bottoms of pop bottles for eyes, but\r\nwould advise some other filling if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nPRESERVATIVE PREPARATIONS, FORMULAS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably arsenic in some form has been, and will continue to be the\r\nleading taxidermic preservative, or rather, insect deterrent. Many\r\npeople are shy of handling this, but with reasonable care the use of\r\narsenic is perfectly safe. Always keep poisons well labeled and out of\r\nthe way of children. Nine children out of ten would never think of\r\nsampling them, but the tenth might prove the fatal exception.\r\n\r\nThere is far less danger to the operator in handling the needful amount\r\nof poisons than in endeavoring to save some rare but over-ripe subject.\r\nIn many years' use of arsenic, dry, in wet solution, and in soap, I have\r\nreceived nothing more serious than an occasional sore finger.\r\n\r\nThe shape in which I have found it most satisfactory for poisoning hair\r\nand feathers of mounted specimens and the interior of furred skins I\r\nwill give as\r\n\r\nARSENICAL SOLUTION.\r\n\r\n    Commercial arsenic       1 lb.\r\n    Bicarbonate of soda    1/2 lb.\r\n    Water                    5 pts.\r\n\r\nBoil until arsenic and soda have dissolved, stirring frequently. Use a\r\nvessel at least twice as large as necessary to contain the quantity used\r\nas it foams up while boiling. When cold put in a large bottle or jar\r\nmarked _Poison_, of course. For poisoning finished specimens,\r\nmounted heads, etc., take one part of this solution to two parts water\r\nand spray the entire surface with this in an atomizer or larger sprayer.\r\nIt should be tested before using by dipping a black feather in it and if\r\na gray or white deposit is left on drying, it should be diluted still\r\nfurther until this is prevented.\r\n\r\nTo poison the inside of skins we make Arsenical Paste: Arsenical\r\nSolution (full strength), whiting sufficient to produce the consistency\r\nof cream. This should be mixed in a wide mouthed bottle or small pan and\r\napplied with a common paint brush. Do not apply to a perfectly dry skin,\r\nlike tanned hide for a robe or rug, but dampen the inside first with\r\nclear water, then paint over with the paste and it will strike through\r\nto the fur side and be taken up around the fur roots by capillary\r\naction. This tends to put a damper on the activities of the moth, whose\r\nfavorite grazing ground is at the hair roots just outside the skin.\r\n\r\nThe paste is equally good on skins of birds, except, perhaps the smaller\r\nones, when freshly skinned, and some of the smaller mammals. The mixture\r\nof whiting makes it easy to see when the surface has already been\r\ntreated, unless the skin is dressed white, in which case dry ochre may\r\nbe used in place of whiting.\r\n\r\nFor poisoning the skins of the smaller furred animals and all but the\r\nlarger birds:\r\n\r\nDRY PRESERVATIVE.\r\n\r\n    Powdered white arsenic\r\n    Powdered alum\r\n\r\nMix equal parts by measure and apply to inside of the fresh skin with a\r\nsoft brush or pad of cotton. If during the skinning and cleaning the\r\nskin has dried so the powder will not stick, moisten the inside of the\r\nskin with water before applying. Some taxidermists prefer to use in\r\nplace of the paste some form of Arsenical Soap. This may be purchased\r\nfrom the supply dealer or made at home at quite a reduction. Personally\r\nI dislike the greasy, sticky feel of it; it is apt to cling around the\r\nfinger nails and scratches, making them sore.\r\n\r\nHowever, the following is the best formula for a time honored\r\npreservative:\r\n\r\nHORNADAY'S ARSENICAL SOAP.\r\n\r\n    White bar soap            1 lb.\r\n    Powdered arsenic          1 lb.\r\n    Camphor gum               2-1/2 oz.\r\n    Subcarbonate of potash    3 oz.\r\n    Alcohol (wood or grain)   4 oz.\r\n\r\nSlice the soap and melt slowly with a little water. When melted stir in\r\nthe potash and arsenic. Boil to the consistency of molasses and pour\r\ninto a jar to harden. Add the camphor already dissolved in the alcohol\r\nand stir occasionally while cooling. Mix with water and apply with a\r\npaint brush to flesh side of skins.\r\n\r\nIn case one is timid about using any of the arsenical preparations I\r\nwould advise them to try\r\n\r\nBROWNE'S NON-POISONOUS PRESERVATIVE SOAP.\r\n\r\n    Whiting          24 oz.\r\n    White soap        8 oz.\r\n    Chloride lime   1/2 oz.\r\n    Tincture camphor  1 oz.\r\n    Water             1 pt.\r\n\r\nShave the soap thin and boil it with the whiting and water till\r\ndissolved. Then remove from the fire and stir in the chloride, adding\r\nthe tincture camphor later when cold, as much of the strength of the\r\nlatter would be lost were the mixture hot.\r\n\r\nKeep in closed jars or bottles, and if too thick, thin down with water\r\nor alcohol. Apply like arsenical soap or paste. This is highly\r\nrecommended by English writers. For a non-poisonous powder I would\r\nadvise equal parts of powdered alum and insect powder in place of the\r\narsenic and alum.\r\n\r\nSOLUTION FOR THE PRESERVATION OF SMALL SPECIMENS ENTIRE.\r\n\r\n    Formaldehyde (40% strength)  1 part\r\n    Water                        9 parts\r\n\r\nMix thoroughly and put in glass or earthen jars or large mouthed\r\nbottles.\r\n\r\nWhile most of the heads and skins of big game are preserved until they\r\ncan reach the taxidermist, many of the smaller specimens become a total\r\nloss. Lack of time and knowledge are the chief causes of this loss of\r\nvaluable souvenirs of days out of doors and interesting natural objects.\r\nProbably the easiest and least expensive method of temporarily\r\npreserving entire the smaller animals, birds, fish and reptiles is by\r\nimmersion in the above preparation.\r\n\r\nI would not advise its use on animals larger than a small fox or cat,\r\nand to insure an immediate penetration of the flesh the abdominal\r\nviscera should be removed from the larger specimens. The amount of\r\nsolution used should be about ten times the volume of the subject, and\r\nit had best be replaced with fresh liquid after two or three days. I\r\nthink this will work equally well on birds, reptiles and mammals.\r\n\r\nOn removal from the solution they may be skinned and mounted as fresh\r\nspecimens. On removing from the solution, rinse in water containing a\r\nlittle ammonia to neutralize the irritating odor of the formaldehyde. Do\r\nnot stand over the solution while mixing as the fumes of the formic acid\r\naffect the eyes. The condensed form in which this chemical can be\r\ncarried and its cheapness (30c. per lb.), make it desirable as a\r\ntemporary preservative. The saying, \"It never rains but it pours,\"\r\napplies to the taxidermist and a sudden rush of subjects may often be\r\nsaved by using the foregoing preparation. Other work may be under way,\r\nor for other reasons it may be desirable to keep a specimen in the flesh\r\na short time before mounting.\r\n\r\nALCOHOLIC SOLUTION.\r\n\r\n    Alcohol (94% strength)  Equal parts\r\n    Water\r\n\r\nIf alcohol is less than 94% use less water. Use same as formaldehyde\r\nsolution. This is said to be superior to the formaldehyde solution,\r\nthough more expensive and harder to carry about on account of its\r\ngreater bulk before mixing.\r\n\r\nSpecimens kept long in any liquid are apt to lose their colors. This\r\nfading will be reduced to a minimum if kept in the dark.\r\n\r\nIn order to do any satisfactory work on quadrupeds the taxidermist makes\r\nuse of a bath or pickle of some sort for keeping skins in a wet state.\r\nThis pickle sets the hair and in a measure tans the skin, reducing its\r\nliability to shrinkage and rendering it less desirable pasturage for\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nAll furred skins of any size should be immersed in this for a time\r\nbefore mounting, and may be kept in it for months or years without\r\ninjury. If you have time to skin an animal properly the skin may be\r\ndropped in the pickle jar and in a day, week, or month be better fit for\r\nfinal mounting than at first.\r\n\r\nFor the first few days it is necessary to move it about every day so all\r\nparts may be exposed to the action of the pickle. The form of pickle\r\nwhich I have found most helpful is:\r\n\r\nTANNING LIQUOR.\r\n\r\n    Water                    1 gal.\r\n    Salt                     1 qt.\r\n    Sulphuric acid (measure) 1 oz.\r\n\r\nBring to boiling point to dissolve the salt. Allow to cool before\r\nstirring in the acid. When cold is ready for use.\r\n\r\nWhen keeping skins in a wet state a long time I would prefer to use:\r\n\r\nSALT AND ALUM PICKLE.\r\n\r\n    Water  1 gal.\r\n    Salt   1 qt.\r\n    Alum   1 pt.\r\n\r\nBoil to dissolve salt and alum; use like preceding.\r\n\r\nIf skins are to be kept some time they should, after a preliminary\r\npickling, be put in new, fresh pickle and it should be occasionally\r\ntested with a salinometer and kept up to the original strength. Dirty\r\nand greasy pickle should be thrown away, but if clean and of low\r\nstrength it can be brought up by adding new pickle of extra strength. It\r\nwill do no hurt if more salt, even a saturated solution, is made of\r\neither of the foregoing.\r\n\r\nWhile the salt and alum or acid pickle will keep our animal skins safely\r\nand in a relaxed condition ready for further preparation at any time, it\r\nwill not answer for bird skins. For this we have a solution for keeping\r\nbird skins soft:\r\n\r\n    Glycerine               2 parts\r\n    Carbolic acid           1 part\r\n\r\nAfter skinning the bird and applying some arsenical solution to the\r\ninside, brush this solution liberally over the entire inside of the\r\nskin. Pay special attention to the bones, wing and leg, skull and root\r\nof the tail. If necessary the skin may be packed flat for shipment. One\r\ntreatment will keep all but the larger skins soft for several months.\r\nThe feet, of course, will become hard and dry and must be relaxed as\r\nusual before mounting.\r\n\r\nEvery taxidermist needs to be more or less of a modeler, and one of the\r\nmost useful materials is:\r\n\r\nPAPIER MACHE.\r\n\r\n    Wet wood pulp                        10 oz.\r\n    Glue (hot) or LePage's (measure)      3 oz.\r\n    Plaster paris, dry                   20 oz.\r\n\r\nThis formula may be varied at the convenience of the operator. Work the\r\nglue into the pulp and knead the plaster into the mass. The more glue\r\nthe slower it sets and a few drops of glycerine will keep it soft\r\nseveral days. Made with little or no glue it hardens quickly.\r\n\r\nIf the paper pulp is not at hand it may be made by tearing old\r\nnewspapers or sheathing paper small and boiling and pounding till a pulp\r\nresults. This composition is much in use in Europe in the making of many\r\nfamiliar toys and similar objects.\r\n\r\nFor modeling open mouths, finishing mounted specimens, making artificial\r\nrocks, stumps and boughs, it is very desirable.\r\n\r\nWAX FOR OPEN MOUTHS.\r\n\r\n    Beeswax               1 part\r\n    Paraffin wax          1 part\r\n\r\nMelt and color with tube oil colors. To color dip up a spoonful of\r\nmelted wax, squeeze some tube color in and stir until stiff. Place the\r\nspoon in the hot wax and stir till evenly mixed. Do not try to put the\r\ncolor directly in the hot wax as it will not mix evenly so.\r\n\r\nWax should be melted in a water bath, like a glue pot, as excessive heat\r\nwill darken it. Cakes of wax of suitable colors may be had of the supply\r\ndealers and are most economical when no great amount of work is done.\r\nThe same parties supply the paper pulp previously mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPANELS, SHIELDS AND NATURAL AND ARTIFICIAL MOUNTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preparation of a suitable setting for almost any mounted specimen\r\nwill add greatly to its attractiveness. If you know where it is to be\r\nplaced it is not difficult to make it suit its surrounding. For\r\ninstance, a head of big game for hanging in a dining or ball room is\r\nsuitably mounted on a polished and carved hardwood shield. While this\r\nwould hardly match its surroundings on the wall of a log camp, a rustic\r\npanel of natural wood with the bark on would perfectly suit the latter\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nHeads, horns, and antlers are usually mounted on what are called\r\nshields. Fish and trophies of dead game birds and small game on panels.\r\nSingle specimens are placed on severely plain wooden bases (museum\r\nstyle) or on those simulating branches, rocks, stumps or earth. These\r\nare artificial, but those built up in part at least with natural objects\r\nare most pleasing.\r\n\r\nAs we can not produce the best patterns of shields without special\r\nmachines we must patronize either the supply dealers or the wood working\r\nmill for such. If convenient to a mill equipped with jigsaw and moulder\r\nthey can be made up after your own patterns.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHIELDS--VARIOUS KINDS AND SIZES.\r\n\r\n(A) Suitable for moose, caribou, deer, fox by making or ordering\r\naccording to size wanted; (B) Moose, caribou, deer; (K) Round shield;\r\n(E) Bear shield; (Q) Combination--head and feet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHIELDS, FOOT AND HALL RACK.\r\n\r\n(C) and (D) Deer Shields (J) Four Feet Rack (V) Hall Rack]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GUN RACK, FISH AND GAME PANELS, HALL RACK.\r\n\r\n(I) Gun rack (F) Fish panel (H) Shield, combination head and feet (S)\r\nHall Rack, small.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOME SHIELDS AND PANELS.\r\n\r\n(M) Shield with carving (G) Panel for game, x, y, z, aa, bb Deer foot\r\nthermometers (L) Deer foot thermometer and small animal panel.]\r\n\r\nSome of the sizes most used are approximately as follows for mounted\r\nheads:\r\n\r\n    For moose, elk, caribou.\r\n      20×30 inches.\r\n\r\n    For deer, goat or sheep.\r\n      12×18 or 16×21.\r\n\r\n    For fox or lynx.\r\n      8×10 inches.\r\n\r\n    For bear or wolf.\r\n      12×15\r\n\r\n    For birds, small fur-bearers and fish.\r\n      6×8 in.\r\n\r\n    Oval panels for mounting fish.\r\n      9×22         15×40\r\n\r\n    For dead game.\r\n      10×15    14×24    17×25\r\n\r\nFor mounting horns of elk and moose the size for deer heads will answer\r\nnicely, while deer antlers are suitable with a shield of the fox head\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nIn order to draw a symmetrical pattern for the woodworker, take a piece\r\nof stiff paper of the right length and width, fold it down the middle,\r\ndraw one half to suit and cut out with shears. The style of moulding\r\ncalled Ogee is to be preferred. A simple diamond, heart, or oval shape\r\ncan be made at home with beveled or rounded edges, or if your tools\r\ninclude a turning saw (which is most useful for a variety of purposes)\r\nyou may try a more pretentious shield. To achieve this, make your\r\npattern as just described and after marking it on a piece of wood from\r\n3/8 to 7/8 inch thick, cut out with the turning saw. It should be held\r\nin the vise for this operation. Place this cut out shield (1) on a piece\r\nof board of similar thickness but somewhat larger and with a pair of\r\ncompasses mark out another 1/2 in. or so larger all around. (2) Also\r\nmark the same distance inside the edge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOME MADE SHIELD.]\r\n\r\nWith a wood worker's gauge or something similar make a mark around them\r\nboth near the lower sides. Now with draw shave and rasp work the edges\r\noff both Nos. 1 and 2. No. 1 on a bevel, No. 2 rounded. There should be\r\na number of holes drilled and countersunk in No. 2, from the back, and\r\nwhen the two parts of the shield are properly adjusted they should be\r\ndrawn closely together with screws too short to penetrate the face of\r\nthe shield.\r\n\r\nIf the adjustment is perfect the screws are to be drawn and the surfaces\r\nwhich come in contact coated well with glue, then drawn closely together\r\nand laid aside until thoroughly dry, when it should be well sandpapered\r\nbefore varnishing.\r\n\r\nAll shields and panels should be carefully sandpapered, filled and\r\nvarnished, and polished if you wish. Don't make the shield or panel so\r\nornate that the specimen will seem but an incidental, thrown in for good\r\nmeasure, so to speak.\r\n\r\nRustic panels can be made by sawing the end from a log on a slant, and\r\nplaning smooth the oval. If this is heavily varnished on the front and\r\nback and the bark left on it is a very suitable mount for small heads,\r\nfish and birds. Artificial branches and trees for mounting birds should\r\nbe avoided if possible; they are made by wrapping tow around wires,\r\ncoating with glue and covering with moss or papier mache and painting.\r\nThe result I consider unnatural and inartistic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SMALL BIRD.]\r\n\r\nI would advise to use natural branches as far as possible; sufficient\r\nlabor will be required to make necessary joining and changes look as\r\nnear like nature as you can. Rock work is usually made of a wooden\r\nframework covered with cloth, wire or paper and finished with a coating\r\nof glue and crushed stone or sand. One of the most useful materials in\r\nthis work is the rough cork bark so much used by florists. It is light,\r\ncomes in desirable shapes, can be nailed, sawed or coated with glue or\r\npaint. For constructing stumps for mounted birds of prey and rustic\r\nstands for small and medium fur animals it has no equal. Some\r\ntaxidermists produce rock work of an obscure geological period by\r\ncovering screen wire forms with a mixture of flour, baking powder and\r\nplaster of paris and water. This is put in an oven and baked hard, the\r\nweird result being painted to the artist's taste.\r\n\r\nWater worn roots such as are found along the shore, twisted laurel\r\nbranches, limbs of gum, oak and sassafras, all work up well in this and\r\nshould be stored up to dry against a day of need. Out door people have a\r\ngood eye for such things, but they are hard to find when you look for\r\nthem, so gather them on your rambles. Papier mache is also a good\r\nmodeling material for stumps, limbs and rock, being light, and readily\r\ntaking coats of glue or paint. The expert can copy nature closely with\r\nit.\r\n\r\nSome leaves and grasses can be pressed, dried and colored their natural\r\nshades with oil paints. The dealers supply a great variety of artificial\r\nfoliage, some of which may be used to advantage, in case work\r\nespecially. Dried mosses and lichens of various sorts may be used in\r\nthis. Some of these powdered and glued on papier mache or cork bark\r\nstumps and limbs produce a very pleasing effect.\r\n\r\nSnow scenes are frequently attempted but are not always a success. The\r\npeculiar fluffy and glittering appearance is rather difficult to\r\nreproduce. Torn or ground up white blotting paper mixed with a little\r\nground mica has been used for this purpose. Glass icicles are listed by\r\ndealers and are quite natural in appearance, but the simulation of water\r\nis difficult and often disappointing.\r\n\r\nIt is often desirable to mount small specimens, of birds especially, in\r\ncases of some kind which will protect them from dust, dirt and rough\r\nhandling and at the same time display them to advantage. The oldest and\r\nat the same time the least suitable contrivance for this is the well\r\nknown bell glass or globe. It is difficult to find a safe place for this\r\nin the average house and it is not at all adapted to many specimens.\r\n\r\nA plain wall case with glass front and a painted or decorated background\r\nwill give the necessary protection with the least expense. For small\r\nbird groups, and singles and pairs of game birds, the oval convex\r\nglasses probably present the finest appearance. The backgrounds for\r\nthese may be either plush or wood panels or hand painted, and any style\r\nof picture framing may be used. These are made in several sizes, listing\r\nat $2.00 to $8.00 each without backgrounds or frames. This cost has\r\nprobably prevented their more common use.\r\n\r\nThere is on the market a papier mache background also adapted to any\r\npicture frame, called the \"concave dust proof case.\" This has the flat\r\nface glass of the old style wall case, but with the square corners and\r\nmuch of the weight eliminated. Any of these styles of wall cases may be\r\nplaced on shelves as well as hung on the wall like pictures, at once\r\npreventing breakage and becoming valuable decorations.\r\n\r\nSpecial cases are often built (as in museums) for large and valuable\r\nmounted specimens. Of these the top and at least three sides should be\r\nof glass. The preparing and placing of the accessories in some large\r\nmuseum cases have required an unbelievable amount of time and expense to\r\nattain the desired natural appearance of the mounting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nFIELD WORK, COLLECTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile it is unlikely that many readers of this book will undertake the\r\ncollection of natural history specimens in any great numbers or as a\r\nspecial business, a few words on the subject may not be amiss.\r\n\r\nIt is well to bear in mind that the better the condition of the specimen\r\nwhen it first comes to hand, the greater will be our chances of success\r\nin properly preserving it. A small bird shot with a rifle is not worth\r\nbothering with unless excessively rare, and a fur bearer which the dogs\r\nhave been allowed to maul and chew is very difficult to put in\r\nsatisfactory condition.\r\n\r\nOne rule of the collector in the field is to shoot each specimen with\r\nthe smallest possible charge of shot and powder which will kill it. I\r\nspeak of shooting, as probably three-fourths of the objects mounted by\r\nthe average taxidermist have been killed with fire arms.\r\n\r\nOf late years a number of collector's guns have been put out by the arms\r\nmakers, though any good small bore shotgun will answer for collecting\r\nall of our small and medium sized American birds and mammals. Some of\r\nthese guns of about .44 cal. are exceedingly accurate and reliable\r\nperformers.\r\n\r\nIn one case this small bore shotgun has been combined with a rifle, and\r\nthe light weight and portability of this little arm makes it about the\r\nlast word in guns for collecting all small specimens.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARBLE'S SHOT GUN AND RIFLE COMBINED.]\r\n\r\nIt as well as other single guns of the same bore, is built to use a\r\nround ball in the shot barrel, making them capable of stopping deer or\r\nbear at short ranges. However, choosing a gun is like choosing a wife,\r\nevery one has their own tastes.\r\n\r\nI would advise the would-be collector to load his own shotgun shells, at\r\nleast those for small birds and animals, as it is almost impossible to\r\nget factory loaded shells but what are charged too heavily.\r\n\r\nFor the collection of animals for taxidermic purposes the use of traps\r\nwill probably yield some of the best as well as the more rare and\r\nunusual varieties. Such styles of traps as least injure the appearance\r\nof the finished specimen are preferred.\r\n\r\nThe old-fashioned snare, dead-fall and box trap are as good as any in\r\nthis respect. The wire spring or choke traps of Stop Thief style are\r\nahead of the common steel trap in this respect, but like the homemade\r\ntraps cannot be used in so many various situations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE \"STOP THIEF\" OR CHOKE TRAP.]\r\n\r\nWater animals taken in steel traps may usually be quickly drowned. If\r\nset on land they should be tended often to prevent suffering and usually\r\nmutilation of the trapped game. Full information on this subject will be\r\nfound in Science of Trapping and other books on special animals by same\r\npublisher.\r\n\r\nThe naturalist uses more small traps than large ones in most cases;\r\nmany, many more specimens being taken in No. 1's than in bear traps.\r\nSeveral styles of mouse and rat traps are useful in collecting the\r\nsmaller mammals, such as mice, rats and ground squirrels of various\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nFish are to be collected any way you can get 'em, (legally at least).\r\nMany varieties of these are to be bought at the large markets and many\r\nrare and hideous specimens are discarded by market fishermen when\r\nculling their catches. A few years ago before much restriction was\r\nimposed on the sale of game it was possible to purchase many desirable\r\nthings at the markets of Washington, D. C. Not only bear and deer, but\r\nelk, ptarmigan, arctic hares, sage and prairie grouse, fox squirrels,\r\npileated woodpeckers and many other odds and ends were offered for sale\r\nas well as all the usual land and water game.\r\n\r\nHowever you take your specimens or how badly damaged they may be when\r\nthey reach your hands it behooves you to see that no further damage\r\nbefalls them.\r\n\r\nSpecimens when shot should have all possible blood and dirt brushed or\r\nwashed from feathers or fur and all shot holes, as well as mouth and\r\nnostrils plugged with a wisp of cotton to prevent further soiling. An\r\nawl, or piece of wire will be useful for this. Blood should be removed\r\nfrom white fur or feathers as soon as possible or it will be stained\r\nmore or less. Small birds should be dropped head first into a paper\r\ncone, and laid in a basket or box if possible, the common hunting coat\r\npocket is apt to break delicate feathers, though if the bird is well\r\nwrapped it may do.\r\n\r\nFur bearers will stand more rough usage and may be tied together by\r\nheads or feet or packed in game bag or pocket. Fish should be wrapped in\r\npaper to protect the scales.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that specimens which it is planned to preserve\r\nshould be kept cool if possible until work can be started on them. Some\r\nvarieties spoil more quickly than others; fish eating birds need quick\r\nattention; most birds of the hawk and owl family keep well, as do the\r\npheasants, grouse, etc. Frozen animals keep perfectly in that state but\r\nspoil quickly after thawing.\r\n\r\nKeep away from blow flies. Specimens are often sent to the taxidermists\r\nin apparent good order and when received are entirely ruined by fly\r\nmaggots; the eggs being deposited before packing and shipping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nSKINNING AND PRESERVING SKINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWith a suitable specimen at hand it is for us to decide if we shall\r\nmount it or preserve it as a skin temporarily or indefinitely. To\r\nillustrate we will presume that we have a muskrat just from the trap\r\nwhich is to be mounted at once.\r\n\r\nBefore skinning it is best to get some measurements to guide us in the\r\nlater work. In this case where the skin is to be mounted immediately a\r\nsimple outline is sufficient, as we will have the body in the flesh and\r\nall the leg bones, etc., to guide us in rebuilding the creature.\r\n\r\nTo get such outline, lay the animal on its side on a piece of blank\r\npaper, put the feet and legs in some natural position, fasten them in\r\nplace with a few pins and mark around the entire animal with a pencil.\r\nThe eye, hip and shoulder joints, and base of skull may be indicated on\r\nthis outline sheet. Our muskrat is a trapped and drowned one so we will\r\nnot have to replace the shot hole plugs with fresh ones, as would be\r\nbest if it had been killed with the gun. Also it has been dead long\r\nenough for the rigor mortis to prevent the free flow of blood and body\r\njuices which bother the operator if it has been killed but an hour or\r\nless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OUTLINE OF MUSKRAT. HIP AND SHOULDER JOINTS MARKED]\r\n\r\nLaying the animal on its back, make the opening cut by pushing the knife\r\npoint through the skin at the juncture of neck and chest. Run the blade\r\ndown between skin and flesh, separating the skin in a long clean cut to\r\nthe root of the tail. Open the tail also along the under side from the\r\ntip to within an inch or so of its base. Slit open the sole of each foot\r\nfrom the middle toe to the heel and further if necessary so the leg skin\r\nmay be turned down over the foot.\r\n\r\nBeginning at this central cut, skin back each side until the shoulder\r\nand hip joints are encountered. Bending the limb will show the exact\r\njoint where the muscles are cut apart and the legs severed from the\r\nbody. Cut off the tail near its base, leaving it in the skin for the\r\npresent. Loosen the skin from back and shoulders and turn it wrong side\r\nout over the head. Skin down until the ears are reached, cutting them\r\noff close down to the head and continue on to the eyes. Work carefully\r\naround these and cut close to the skull to avoid hacking the eyelids.\r\nCut through the nose cartilage, and when the lips are reached cut them\r\naway close to the gums, leaving both their inner and outer skin on the\r\npelt. Cutting them off at the edge of the hair is a frequent cause of\r\ntrouble as they are full and fleshy and should be split, pared down on\r\nthe inside and when mounted, filled out to their natural shape to\r\nperfect the anatomy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKINNING SMALL ANIMAL FOR MOUNTING. CUT ON DOTTED LINES.]\r\n\r\nNow the skin of each leg may be turned wrong side out down to the toes\r\nand all flesh and muscle cut away from the leg bones with knife and\r\nscissors. The tail also is to be removed from its skin and the ears\r\nturned wrong side out to their tips. In skinning no flesh of any\r\nconsequence should be left adhering to the skin and it should never be\r\npulled off by main strength, but rather separated by the knife or\r\nfingers, pushing the flesh away from the skin rather than the reverse.\r\nThe skull should now be cleaned as the leg bones were and if a number of\r\nspecimens are being prepared at the same time the heads may be put in a\r\nkettle and boiled a short time, when on trying with a fork or awl the\r\nflesh becomes tender and may be rapidly removed with a knife.\r\n\r\nThe brain may be removed with a hooked wire, the skull well rinsed\r\ninside and out and given a good coat of arsenical paste or other\r\npreservative. The next step is determined by what you intend doing with\r\nthe skin. If it is to be kept for purposes of study without mounting it\r\nshould be made up as a scientific skin. If to be mounted at once or in\r\nthe near future it should be put in the jar of salt and acid or alum. It\r\ncan of course be mounted at once without this bath but I believe it is\r\nwell worth any extra work it entails.\r\n\r\nSome young furred animals and others with very delicate skins do not\r\nwork up well from the bath and had best be mounted without it, being\r\nhandled more as bird skins are.\r\n\r\nIn skinning the larger quadrupeds we make two additional cuts, from the\r\nright to the central line and out to the left fore foot and a similar\r\ncut connecting the hind feet. These opening cuts are on the back and\r\ninside of the legs, you will understand.\r\n\r\nWith most large subjects another cut from the shoulders up the back of\r\nthe neck is necessary. On animals having horns or antlers this is\r\nterminated in a Y or T shape, reaching the base of the antlers. After\r\nloosening the skin around the antlers the head is removed through this\r\nincision. As it is hardly possible to make an outline sketch of a large\r\nanimal, as full a set of measurements as possible is useful in all\r\ncases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKINNING LARGE ANIMAL FOR MOUNTING. CUT ON DOTTED LINES.]\r\n\r\nThe bones of the legs will be in the way attached to the skin and the\r\ntwo upper bones of each leg may be detached and if lack of space or\r\ntransportation make it necessary, thrown away, though if the bones of\r\none hind leg and one front leg are preserved artificial duplicates may\r\nbe carved.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKINNING BIRD-BREAST CUT.]\r\n\r\nIn skinning birds, after fresh cotton plugs have been put in place the\r\nfeathers are parted and the opening incision made through the skin only\r\nfrom the middle of the breast to the root of the tail. Separate the skin\r\nand flesh on each side until the knee is reached, push this up until the\r\nknife or scissors can be passed under it and the leg severed at the\r\njoint. A little corn meal sprinkled on the exposed flesh and the\r\noperator's fingers will prevent the feathers adhering and becoming\r\nsoiled as the work proceeds.\r\n\r\nCut off the flesh in which the tail quills are rooted leaving it on the\r\nskin with one or two of the last vertebrae. Use care in this or you will\r\ncut the skin above the tail too. The body may now be hung up by a cord\r\ntied to the stump of one of the legs and both hands used in separating\r\nand turning the skin back until the wings are reached. The skin is\r\nloosened around these and they may be severed at the elbow joint unless\r\nthe bird is to be mounted with wings spread, when it will be best to\r\nunjoint at the shoulder and preserve the entire wing bones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOODED MERGANSER.]\r\n\r\nWith the wings detached we skin on to the base of the skull. In some of\r\nthe ducks, and other water birds, woodpeckers and owls the neck is so\r\nslender and the skull so large that it is necessary to cut the neck off\r\nhere and making a cut down the back of the head and neck continue the\r\nskinning of the head through it. Do not cut or tear the membrane of the\r\nears but pull it out with the forceps and work down over the eyes,\r\ncutting the membrane connecting the skin but not the lids or eyeball\r\nitself. The liquid contents of the eye are particularly sticky and\r\ndifficult to remove from feathers.\r\n\r\nContinue skinning to the base of the bill, scoop the eyes from their\r\nsockets and cut loose the forward part of the skull from the neck. This\r\nis usually accomplished with four snips of the scissors much easier to\r\npractice than to describe.\r\n\r\nMake one cut on each side of the head, through the small bone connecting\r\nthe base of the lower jaw with the skull, another through the roof of\r\nthe mouth at the base of the upper mandible and between the jaws of the\r\nlower, and the last through the skull behind the eyes and parallel with\r\nthe roof of the mouth. This will free the skull of the neck and most of\r\nits flesh and muscle.\r\n\r\nIn most cases the head should be returned to the skin as soon as\r\npossible to avoid its drying out of shape and giving the feathers a\r\nwrong set. After cleaning and poisoning the skull and filling the eye\r\nsockets with cotton this reversing is undertaken. If working on a small\r\nbird the learner is apt to come to grief here, as only by careful and\r\npatient work without the application of some force is the returning\r\nprocess accomplished successfully.\r\n\r\nThe wings and legs may now be skinned down to the first joint and all\r\nflesh and muscle removed from the bones. This is done expeditiously by\r\nsnipping off the end of the leg bone and stripping it down with adhering\r\nflesh to the ankle joint where it (the flesh) is cut off.\r\n\r\nThe wings are skinned to the first joint, stripping the wing primary\r\nfeathers from their fastening on the bone with the thumb nail, clipping\r\noff the large bone near the end and detaching the small bone with all\r\nflesh and muscle adhering. If this is clipped off at the wrist joint the\r\nentire wing is cleaned. This method applies to all small and medium\r\nbirds not wanted with spread wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OPENING CUT ON BIRD.\r\n\r\nOpening and Cleaning Wing from Underneath For Spread Wing Mounting.]\r\n\r\nIn case wing spread is wanted the primary feathers are not disturbed but\r\nthat part of the wing is cleaned from a slit in the under side of the\r\nwing. All but the smallest birds should have the tip joint of the wing\r\nslit open on the under side and some form of preservative worked in the\r\nopening. Specimens the size of a crow and larger should have a cut made\r\nin the bottom of the foot and the tendons of the lower leg drawn out\r\nwith an awl, and in the case of very large birds it may be necessary to\r\nsoak the unfeathered part of the legs and feet in a pan of strong pickle\r\nfor 24 hours, to prevent decay and damage from insects. Our bird is now\r\nentirely ready for the application of such preservatives as we may be\r\nusing.\r\n\r\nThe main principle in the preserving of skins may be stated thus: All\r\nskins must be removed and cleaned of flesh so the preservative may be\r\napplied to every part of the inner surface, where it will act directly\r\non the roots of the hair or feathers.\r\n\r\nThe preservative applied, we must decide on the next step, whether it is\r\nto be mounted at once, in a short time, or laid away indefinitely as a\r\nscientific skin.\r\n\r\nIf we have to lay it away until tomorrow, put a little cotton inside to\r\nprevent the inner surface sticking together, wrap in a damp cloth and\r\nunless the weather is very hot it will be all right.\r\n\r\nIf very hot or it is necessary to lay it aside for some days, the inner\r\nside should be well coated with the carbolic and glycerine mixture. As a\r\nscientific skin it should be made up at once, tagged with a full set of\r\nmeasurements taken before skinning and laid aside to dry. These\r\nmeasurements are not needed if we mount it at once, as the skinned body\r\nis at hand for comparison, but the sex, date, locality and collector's\r\nname should be attached to the completed specimen.\r\n\r\nAlligators and the lizard family are skinned like the other four-footed\r\nspecies, as are snakes and fish, with the exception they have no limb\r\nbones to be cleaned and preserved. Fish are better opened along one side\r\nthan the central line of the body.\r\n\r\nReptile skins if not put in the pickle jar had better be packed in salt\r\nafter poisoning as when entirely dry they are practically ruined. Skins\r\nof fish are best kept in either a saturated solution of salt (water with\r\nsalt added until no more will dissolve), alcohol or formaldehyde\r\nsolution. Whatever method is used the delicate colors will vanish and\r\nunless you can have a fresh specimen at hand when mounting it you should\r\nmake the best color record you are able. This is true to some extent at\r\nleast of all coverings of fur, feathers, or scales, and the stronger the\r\nlight the more damage. I have seen a mounted mink placed in direct\r\nsunshine, bleached to a drab and the yellow feathers on a 'flicker faded\r\nalmost white.\r\n\r\nIn order to preserve turtles, after killing with chloroform preferably,\r\nit is necessary in the case of the box or land turtles to cut a square\r\nopening in the under shell through which the body may be removed and the\r\nlegs and neck skinned.\r\n\r\nThe water species can have the lower shell detached from the upper at\r\nthe side and after cutting the skin around the rear two-thirds this\r\nshell is turned over to the front and the skinning and cleaning\r\nproceeded with.\r\n\r\nIf not mounted at once make into a dry skin after poisoning or small\r\nturtles may be put in alcohol.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nMAKING SCIENTIFIC SKINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably most bird skins which are not mounted at once are kept in the\r\nform of \"scientific skins.\" In other words they are skinned, poisoned\r\nand without wiring, given the shape of the dead bird. Their plumage,\r\nsize, etc., may be examined, they are easily packed or shipped and, if\r\nproperly made, may be mounted at any time but at the expenditure of\r\nconsiderably more work than a freshly taken skin requires.\r\n\r\nThe instructions on skinning leaves us with the skin wrong side out with\r\nthe exception of possibly the head. The leg and wing bone, cleaned of\r\nflesh, should be well poisoned as well as the skin and after wrapping\r\nwith pieces of cotton bat to their approximate size, returned to their\r\nplaces. It is well when doing this to under rather than over fill.\r\n\r\nConnect the bones of the wings with a bit of thread or cord. After\r\nfilling out around the eyes and upper throat, wind a small stick or\r\npiece of wire with cotton to a size a little smaller than the natural\r\nneck and push it into the opening at the back of skull.\r\n\r\nThe body can be filled out now with raw cotton, tow, or any similar\r\nsubstance not of animal origin. Fine excelsior is about right for large\r\nbirds. The edges of the opening cut may be drawn together by a few\r\ncoarse stitches. After the feet have been tied together it is time to\r\nadjust all the feathers become well rumpled in handling.\r\n\r\nOur fingers, forceps and a setting needle made of a large needle or part\r\nof a hat pin in a wooden handle will accomplish this. Stained or dirty\r\nplumage should be cleaned before the skin is filled out, by first\r\nsponging with tepid water, then with gasoline or benzine and drying with\r\nplaster of paris or corn meal. Never apply this without the gasoline\r\nfirst or you will have trouble indeed.\r\n\r\nNow the skin is ready for its label, which should supply the following\r\ninformation:\r\n\r\n1. Length in inches from tip of tail to end of tail.\r\n\r\n2. Distance between the tips of outstretched wings.\r\n\r\n3. Length of wing from the first joint.\r\n\r\n4. Color of eyes, feet, bill, etc.\r\n\r\n5. Date, locality, collector.\r\n\r\n6. The sex.\r\n\r\nThe first three items are often combined, in the case of a bluebird for\r\ninstance, 7-12-4, the order being understood.\r\n\r\nUnless the plumage plainly indicates the sex this should be assured by\r\nexamination of the skinned body. By making an opening in the side of\r\nthis near the back bone the inside surface of the small of the back is\r\nexposed. In the case of the male there will be visible two rounded\r\nbodies, varying in size with the season and species, and in the female a\r\nflattened mass of spheres.\r\n\r\nAfter labeling and fastening the bill together with a pin or thread the\r\nskin should be slipped inside a paper tube to dry. Water birds with long\r\nslender necks should have the head bent around beside the body and the\r\nlong legs of waders are bent at the ankle and left resting on the body;\r\nthis to prevent breakage.\r\n\r\nDuck, geese and any fat birds need the inside of the skins well scraped,\r\nsponged with gasoline, partly filled with plaster paris and left for\r\nseveral hours so all grease may be absorbed. This grease should be\r\nremoved prior to applying the preservative as it will prevent any\r\neffectual penetration by the latter.\r\n\r\nAfter cleaning either the inside or out of a skin with plaster it will\r\nbe necessary to gently beat it with a whisk broom or something similar\r\nto dislodge the particles of plaster. A current of air (from a bicycle\r\npump, for instance) will remove the dust from the feathers when dry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCIENTIFIC SKINS, SMALL ANIMALS AND BIRDS.]\r\n\r\nFewest dry scientific skins are made up from the quadrupeds, but in case\r\nthe matter of transportation prevents wet preservation or they are\r\nwanted dry the all around taxidermist must practice at making them up\r\nalso. Like the bird skin they should be thoroughly rid of flesh and fat\r\nafter skinning but do not require such finical handling. Rinsing in\r\nwater with a little washing powder or soda added will remove blood\r\nstains and some grease but the benzine bath with the drying after, as\r\nrecommended in the chapter on tanning, etc., will be needed in case of\r\nvery fat specimens.\r\n\r\nAll small animals are made up about the same as birds, wrapping the leg\r\nbones in tow, oakum or cotton and filling out the body with the same\r\nmaterial. The skull cleaned and poisoned had best be put in the centre\r\nof the body with the filling, when it can be found at any time by\r\nripping a few of the stitches.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the head is filled out with the same material and the tail\r\nmay either be bent up under the body or drawn together by a few stitches\r\naround a wrapped wire extending into the body half its length. Of course\r\nthe operator will see that the entire inner surface of the skin is\r\ntreated liberally with some preservative, arsenical paste preferably,\r\nbefore the filling process.\r\n\r\nAfter stitching up the opening cut the skin is laid on a board, back up\r\nand the legs neatly disposed, the front feet beside the head and the\r\nhind ones drawn back beside the tail. The feet are fastened with a pin\r\neach and after smoothing down the fur with a small metal fur comb the\r\nskin is laid aside in an airy, shady place until fully dry.\r\n\r\nWith each scientific skin a record should be made of the following\r\ndetails:\r\n\r\n1. Length, end of nose to root of tail.\r\n\r\n2. Length of tail from root to end of bone.\r\n\r\n3. Height at shoulders.\r\n\r\n4. Color of eyes, lips, feet, etc.\r\n\r\n5. Name of species, sex, locality, date, and collector's name.\r\n\r\nThese may be noted down on a corner of the outline sheet, which is\r\nnumbered and filed away; the skin tagged with a duplicate number is put\r\nin the pickle jar or made up as a dried skin, whichever is desired, or\r\nthe full information may be put on a tag attached to the skin. Many\r\ncollectors simply number all specimens and preserve all information in\r\ntheir note books. The foregoing details are sufficient for animals less\r\nthan bear and deer in size.\r\n\r\nThe larger animals should have as many as possible of the following\r\nadditional measurements:\r\n\r\n    Distance hip joint to shoulder joint.\r\n    Circumference of forearm.\r\n          \"       \"  neck.\r\n          \"       \"  body.\r\n    Back of leg.\r\n    Weight if possible.\r\n\r\nSkins of large animals, a bear for instance, may have a slight wrapping\r\nof tow or excelsior on the leg bones to prevent their coming in contact\r\nwith the skin and the whole skin laid to dry on a scaffold of poles or\r\nsomething similar. When nearly dry fold up with the legs inside in a\r\nsquare shaped package. This can be tied up with heavy cord or even sewed\r\nup in burlap to prevent damaging the skin in transit. Fish and reptiles\r\nare not a success as dry skins.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nPREPARING DRY AND WET SKINS FOR MOUNTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us assume that we have a dry skin each of a small bird and a furred\r\nanimal which has been properly made up sometime in the past and which it\r\nis necessary to mount. Taking the bird skin first, the usual way is to\r\nfirst wrap the unfeathered parts of legs in some strips of cotton cloth\r\nsaturated with water containing a few drops of carbolic acid until they\r\nbegin to relax or lose their stiffness somewhat.\r\n\r\nThen the filling may be removed from the whole interior of the skin and\r\nbe replaced with pieces of cotton, dampened as before, and the whole\r\nskin wrapped in a cloth or shut in a close box until with some scraping\r\nand manipulation it becomes as pliable as when first removed. Any little\r\nlumps of dried muscle should be broken up and the edges of the opening\r\ncut, scraped and stretched out as they are very apt to wrinkle and curl\r\nup, thus reducing the size of the skin considerably.\r\n\r\nThe eye sockets are to be filled with balls of wet cotton to render the\r\nlids and surrounding skin soft. The roots of quills and tufts of large\r\nfeathers will need loosening as some flesh is necessarily left around\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe small animal skin may be treated the same way but the most thorough\r\nand expeditious method of relaxing skins of both animals and birds\r\n(except the smallest of the latter) is to plunge them into water, clear\r\nin cool weather, slightly carbolized in warm, until they are pretty well\r\nrelaxed. Then go after the inner side with scraper until any lumps of\r\nfat, muscle and the inner skin are well scratched up. Soak in benzine or\r\ngasoline and clean with hot meal, sand, sawdust or plaster as directed\r\nfor tanning. Remember that bird skins must be handled carefully, so do\r\nnot be too strenuous in beating and shaking them.\r\n\r\nOf course if any skin has been laid away with quantities of fat adhering\r\nit will need very gingerly handling to save it, in fact unless\r\n_very_ rare such skins are not worth trying to save as they have\r\nlittle durability however treated. The largest polar bear skin I ever\r\nsaw was ruined by lying \"in the grease\" too long before dressing. Bird\r\nskins preserved with the glycerine carbolic preparation require relaxing\r\nthe legs and a cleaning and dampening up of the inside of the skins.\r\n\r\nFurred skins from the pickle need a good scraping on their inner\r\nsurface, thorough rinsing in soda solution to neutralize the acid and\r\nremove all salt, then the benzine bath and cleaning. Don't forget to\r\nrinse salted or pickled skins else beads of moisture will form on the\r\nspecimen in damp weather and crystals of salt in dry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOOT SKINNED OUT.]\r\n\r\nOccasionally an extra rare skin will drop to pieces through age or other\r\ninfirmities when being prepared for mounting. The only hope for it then\r\nis to glue and pin it piecemeal on a manikin covered with some\r\npreparation which gives it a firm surface. While an expert will achieve\r\nfair results in such work the amateur could hardly expect success.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nMOUNTING SMALL AND MEDIUM BIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA word of advice to the beginner as to the variety of specimen to use in\r\nfirst trials. Don't begin on too small a bird until somewhat adept;\r\nunpracticed fingers bungle sadly over tiny feathered bodies. A first\r\nsubject should be at least as large as a bob white to give room to work,\r\nand of some variety in which the feathers are firmly embedded.\r\n\r\nSnow birds, cardinals, and some others have very thin delicate skins,\r\nthe pigeons shed their feathers on little or no provocation. Blackbirds\r\nand jays are very good to practice on but the very best would be a coot,\r\nsometimes called crow duck or mudhen. It is of fair size, closely\r\ncovered with feathers which will fall in place readily after skinning\r\nand wiring even at the hands of a beginner.\r\n\r\nMany, in fact most, birds have numerous bare patches which the adjacent\r\nfeathered tracts cover perfectly while in the flesh, but which a too\r\ngenerous filling will exhibit in all their nakedness. I had not\r\ndiscovered this until some of my first attempts at mounting birds\r\nnonplussed me by showing numerous patches of bare skin in spite of the\r\nfact that but a few feathers had become loosened in the handling.\r\n\r\nWe will assume that a suitable specimen is at hand, freshly killed and\r\nproperly skinned as per the directions already given. All bones\r\nremaining with the skin, lower leg, wing, skull, etc., have been\r\nstripped of flesh and any shreds remaining poisoned, as has the entire\r\ninner surface of skin. With the skinned body at hand cut three wires of\r\nsuitable size, one a little more than twice the length of the body and\r\nneck, for the body wire, the other two about twice the length of the\r\nlegs may be a size larger as it is important that the leg wires furnish\r\nadequate support.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CLINCHING LEG WIRES IN ARTIFICIAL BODY OF BIRD]\r\n\r\nForm the body wire into a loop which is the outline of the body laid on\r\none side with the surplus end projecting along the line of the neck.\r\nThis loop should not be quite as large as the body, however, to allow\r\nfor a thin layer of filling material over it. Wad up a handful of coarse\r\ntow, push it inside the body loop and wind with coarse thread, drawing\r\nin by pressure and winding and building out with flakes of tow to a\r\nrough shape of the skinned body. The neck also is built up the same way,\r\nmaking it fully as thick as the original but no longer ever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WIRE LOOP FOR BIRD BODY.]\r\n\r\nIf the wire projects more than a couple of inches from this artificial\r\nneck, cut it off at that length and with a flat file or emery wheel give\r\nit a sharp triangular point. The leg wires, too, should be pointed\r\nsimilarly. All wire should be smooth, straight, and free from kinks to\r\nwork well. Coming in coils it will require straightening, the larger\r\nsizes with mallet or hammer and No. 18 and smaller by fastening one end\r\nin the vise and giving the other a sharp tug with a pair of pliers. It\r\nwill be felt to stretch slightly and become quite straight.\r\n\r\nNext insert the pointed end of a leg wire in the bottom of the foot and\r\npass it up along the back of the bone between it and the skin. A\r\nconsiderable knack is necessary to do this successfully and some force\r\nmust be used. Passing the heel joint is difficult but having done this\r\nand emerged inside the skin continue to pass it until it is a little\r\nlonger than the leg bone beside it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WIRING LEG OF BIRD]\r\n\r\nTurn the skin of leg inside out and wrapping tow around both bone and\r\nwire build up a duplicate of the leg from thigh to heel, wrapping snugly\r\nwith thread. Treat the other leg the same.\r\n\r\nWith forceps fill the skull back of mouth with tow cut in short pieces.\r\nA quantity of this may be chopped on the block with the hatchet and kept\r\non hand in a box. Never fill any part of a mounted bird with cotton\r\nunless it may be the sockets as it is impossible to force a sharpened\r\nwire or pin through it.\r\n\r\nThe parts of the wing bones remaining should be wrapped with tow as the\r\nlegs are, only they hardly need any wiring inside unless the bird is to\r\nbe with wings spread. Fasten the ends of the wing bones together by a\r\nstout cord or thread so they are separated the distance between the\r\nshoulders, measuring across the back of body. Now insert the neck wire\r\nin the back of skull forcing it out through the crown until the\r\nartificial neck is brought snugly against the opening at the base of the\r\nskull.\r\n\r\nBend the pointed end over to get it out of the way and adjust the skin\r\nof the neck. Draw the skin of breast over the body keeping the bird on\r\nits back. If the body has been properly made it will fill the skin\r\nrather loosely. If too large it can be removed and made smaller before\r\nproceeding.\r\n\r\nThe operator will note that in all small and medium birds the thigh and\r\nthe upper wing, next the shoulder are not built up and wired with the\r\nrest of the limbs but are filled out later from inside the skin, as in\r\nall ordinary positions they show but little externally, the elbow and\r\nknee joints nestling close to the body among the feathers.\r\n\r\nSo when fastening the legs to the body let the wires enter where the\r\nknee would lie and push the wire through obliquely, upward and forward,\r\npushing and drawing them through the artificial and natural leg until\r\nthe lower ends approach the feet. Grasping the sharpened ends of the leg\r\nwires at the middle of the length projecting from the body, with round\r\nnose pliers bend them over in a hair pin shape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRD WIRED.]\r\n\r\nWork this loop back through the body pulling back through the leg and\r\nclinch the points over into the body again. If the body was firmly made\r\nas it should be, this fixes the legs permanently to it, yet they may be\r\nbent readily at the joints to suit various attitudes.\r\n\r\nAdjust the skin now and fill out at shoulders, thighs, and base of tail\r\nwith some chopped tow. The breast also may need some filling. Sew up the\r\nskin beginning at the breast and finishing at the base of tail, lacing\r\nit together with the ball cover stitch.\r\n\r\nThe pose of the finished specimen you have probably decided on before\r\nnow so it only remains to put it in the desired attitude. This sounds\r\neasy, like sculpture, \"just knock off what stone you don't need and\r\nthere is the statue,\" but it may try your soul at length to obtain the\r\ndesired effect. Good pictures are a great help here, as of course a\r\nliving duplicate would be if you had it.\r\n\r\nBefore setting it on its feet, coax the wings into place as you hold the\r\nbird in your hand and pin them to the body through the elbow and outer\r\njoint of the wing, using several pins 2 to 4 in. long or pieces of\r\nsharpened wire the same size. This will hold the wings out of the way\r\nand they may be changed and fitted perfectly later.\r\n\r\nMounted birds are usually put on temporary stands of rough boards or\r\nlimbs and when fully dried out transferred to a permanent mount which\r\ncan be prepared in the meantime of the exact size and variety wished\r\nfor. On these temporary stands the leg wires are only twisted together\r\nso they can be easily removed. Place the feet in natural positions of\r\nstanding, walking or running and arrange the toes correctly. They had\r\nbest have some pins driven in beside the toes to secure them till dry,\r\nas badly shaped feet will spoil the effect of an otherwise fine piece of\r\nwork, indicating a careless workman.\r\n\r\nIf on a bough or stump the feet should grasp it as if the bird really\r\nmeans to stay on it. Two or three wires like those used on the wings\r\nhold the tail in place by being driven through the base of it into the\r\nbody for half their length.\r\n\r\nFix the head looking down rather than up and to one side rather than\r\nstraight ahead. If you have the proper glass eyes at hand they can be\r\nset now, if not, later will do but the lids are relaxed just now to\r\nreceive them. Fill the back of the sockets with tow or cotton and with a\r\nlittle spoon-shaped modeling tool give this and the inner surface of the\r\nlids a good coating of soft clay. The eyes, cut from the wire stem on\r\nwhich most of them come, are pressed into this and the skin worked into\r\nplace with the point of a big needle or a small awl.\r\n\r\nNow give the plumage a general going over, re-pin the wings if\r\nnecessary, and wind down any obstreperous feathers with thread. A number\r\nof pins or wires thrust in the middle of back and breast will help this\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nStarting at the head wind back to the tail, lacing the thread from pin\r\nto pin, not binding tightly with any one thread but producing a smooth\r\nsurface by holding it down at a multiplicity of points. There are a\r\nnumber of so-called systems for winding birds but the same taxidermist\r\nseldom winds two alike as the needs of the case are sure to differ. To\r\nspread the tails of small birds, spread the feathers as desired and pin\r\nthem between two strips of light cardboard. When dry they will retain\r\ntheir position. If all arranged properly set the bird away to dry; two\r\nweeks will be sufficient for this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRD WOUND WITH THREAD.]\r\n\r\nAny colors on bill or feet and legs should be renewed with oil colors as\r\nthey fade almost entirely; if of a dark or neutral color originally, a\r\ncoating of transparent varnish will do. There is a variety of beetle\r\nwhich delights in dining on such hard parts of mounted birds if not\r\nprotected by paint or varnish.\r\n\r\nPlace the bird on its final mount and fasten the leg wires in grooves\r\ncut in the under side of same so they are flush with surface. The ends\r\nmay be turned over and driven in again or held fast by small staples. If\r\non the under side of a limb or branch a pinch of moss or lichen glued on\r\nwill cover this fastening.\r\n\r\nCut away the binding threads and with cutting pliers cut off all\r\nprojecting pins and wires, leaving what part of them is covered by the\r\nfeathers. Brush any clay from the eyes and if the lids have shrunken\r\naway from them as they do usually, coat a bit of black thread with glue\r\nand with a setting needle place between the lids and glass eyes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE POSE OR POSITION OF CERTAIN BIRDS]\r\n\r\nIf the eyes were not on hand when first mounted the lids should have\r\nbeen relaxed and the eyes set as soon as procured.\r\n\r\nSmall birds may be mounted in fluttering attitudes by pinning the wings\r\nwith a bunch of cotton beneath them, but if an attitude with wings fully\r\nspread is called for they must be treated in a manner similar to the\r\nlegs, inserting the wire under the skin near the tip of the wing and\r\nrunning it along the under side of the wing bones to the body through\r\nwhich it is thrust and clinched as the leg wires were.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLUTTERING POSITION OF SMALL BIRDS.]\r\n\r\nBirds mounted with spread wings cannot be so readily wound to smooth the\r\nplumage and require to be braced with strips of stiff paper and\r\nsometimes extra wires, which are removed when dry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NATURAL STANDING POSITION OF SMALL BIRD ON LIMB.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nMOUNTING LARGE BIRDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same principles employed in the manipulation of smaller species\r\napply to this class with but a few variations. On account of their size\r\nand weight the artificial bodies need to be especially firm in order to\r\nafford a secure anchorage for the wing and leg wires. Also these\r\nsupports should be fastened to the bones in several places with stout\r\ncord or small wire, as wrapping with the tow and thread used on small\r\nbirds is hardly sufficient.\r\n\r\nWhat I would class as being large birds are the larger hawks, owls,\r\nherons, eagles, geese, etc. The several varieties of the ostrich are\r\nknown as colossal birds and are skinned and preserved much as the large\r\nquadrupeds by mounting the prepared skin on a manikin, built in the pose\r\nof the finished specimen and supported by heavy iron rods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BIRD OF PREY--LIMB POSITION.]\r\n\r\nIn mounting eagles or similar birds with wings spread, which seems to be\r\na popular attitude, use the largest wires possible as anything less than\r\nthat will, on account of their size and wide extent, tend to a drooping,\r\nback-boneless appearance entirely out of keeping.\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that large birds do not require the delicate\r\nhandling of small ones, but by way of compensation considerable force is\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPREADING TAIL OF LARGE BIRDS.\r\n\r\nRun a small sharp wire through the quills on under side of tail to\r\nspread it.]\r\n\r\nThe combs and wattles of domestic and wild fowls cannot by any common\r\nprocess be prevented from shriveling and discoloring while drying, but\r\nwhen dry they may be restored by careful modeling in colored wax. This\r\nis applied warm with a brush and given its final finish with hot metal\r\nmodeling tools. For museum work and other high grade work such heads are\r\ncast entire in wax in such a way that all feathers and hair are attached\r\nin their precise places.\r\n\r\nLarge water fowl are often mounted as flying, and suspended by a very\r\nfine wire. A sharpened wire with a ring turned in one end, thrust into\r\nthe middle of the back and clinched in the body, forms a secure point of\r\nsuspension.\r\n\r\nAs it is not usually practicable to case many specimens of large birds,\r\ngive them an extra thorough poisoning and when entirely finished spray\r\nwith either corrosive sublimate or arsenical solution.\r\n\r\nIn making bodies for large birds it is well to use excelsior for the\r\nmain bulk of the body, merely covering the outside with a thin layer of\r\ntow. This is not only more economical but makes a lighter specimen than\r\none filled with tow entirely. Excelsior or wood wool is to be had in\r\nvarying degrees of fineness of upholstery dealers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPREAD EAGLE. WINGS BRACED UP TO DRY.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of a bird which has been wired and sewn up seeming to\r\nrequire further filling out, it can be accomplished in most cases by\r\nmaking an incision under each wing and introducing some flakes of tow\r\nwith a wire stuffing tool. If the bird is mounted with closed wings this\r\nslit need not even be sewed up as the folded wing covers it completely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTANNING, CLEANING AND POISONING SKINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI have used the following method for some years successfully on skins up\r\nto and including the deer in size. Most larger skins need thinning with\r\na special tool, though an experienced hand can manage to thin a heavy\r\nhide with a common draw knife.\r\n\r\nAn empty lard tub, a half barrel or a large earthenware jar to hold the\r\ntan liquor, a fleshing knife and a fleshing beam are necessary to begin\r\nwith at least. Any smith can make a knife of an old, large file or rasp\r\nby working both sides to a blunt edge and drawing the upper end out in a\r\ntang for another handle. A piece of old scythe blade with cloth wrapped\r\naround the ends will do, or a dull draw knife, either. One blade filed\r\ninto fine teeth will be useful in removing the inner or muscular skin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLESHING KNIFE. (Made from old rasp)]\r\n\r\nA slab or plank 6 or 7 feet long, with one end tapered and half rounded,\r\non 2 or 4 legs of such length as to bring the end against the workman's\r\nchest, makes a beam.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BENCH BEAM.]\r\n\r\nA short piece of plank rounded off and bolted to the top of the table or\r\nwork bench will do for small skins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADJUSTABLE BEAM.]\r\n\r\nMake up the quantity of tanning liquor you wish by the following\r\nformula, also given in Chapter III:\r\n\r\n    Water                    1 gallon\r\n    Salt                     1 quart\r\n\r\nBring to the boiling point to readily dissolve the salt, and add\r\n\r\n    Sulphuric acid           1 fluid ounce\r\n\r\nAllow it to cool before putting in the skins. _Handle the undiluted\r\nacid with care._ Use common coarse salt and the commercial acid.\r\nSkins not wanted at once may be left in this pickle for months without\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nAbout a gallon of pickle to a fox size skin is the correct amount, but\r\nit may be used several times before losing its strength.\r\n\r\nAfter the skin is removed from the carcass any blood and dirt is washed\r\nfrom the fur, the flesh side well salted, rolled up and left 12 to 48\r\nhours. Then thoroughly beam or scrape down the inside of the skin,\r\nremoving all flesh, fat and muscles. Skins already dry may be placed\r\neither in clear water or tan liquor until they soften up. It takes\r\nlonger to soften in the tan, but if put in water it must be watched or\r\nthe hair will start, especially in warm weather.\r\n\r\nA very hard, dry skin must be soaked and scraped alternately until\r\nthoroughly relaxed. When well softened, treat same as a fresh skin. If\r\nvery fat or greasy, soak the skin in benzine an hour, wring out well,\r\nhang up till the benzine is about evaporated, then place in the tan. If\r\nnot very fat the skin need not be put in the benzine first, but go in\r\nthe tan at once after being scraped. I use common stove gasoline for\r\nbenzine; it is as good for the purpose of cleaning and deodorizing, and\r\ncheaper. It must never be used in the vicinity of fire or a lighted\r\nlamp, as its evaporation produces a very explosive gas. For this reason\r\nI do the cleaning and beating of furs out of doors if practicable.\r\nGasoline wrung out of skins may be saved and, after allowing to settle,\r\nused again and again. It will not do for the final cleaning of white\r\nfurs, but for removing grease before tanning, it is as good as any. Stir\r\nthe skins about in the tan frequently that all parts may come in contact\r\nwith the solution.\r\n\r\nLight skins like the fox will tan in 24 to 48 hours; heavier ones in\r\nproportional time. When on pulling or stretching the flesh side, it\r\nwhitens, it is tanned. On taking from the tan, rinse the skin well in\r\nlukewarm water containing a handful of washing soda to the bucketful.\r\nWring out with the hands and soak again in benzine for half an hour.\r\nWring out of this and clean the fur at once as follows:\r\n\r\nFill a shallow box part full of clean sand or corn meal which has been\r\nheated in a pot or pan over the fire or in an oven. Work the skin about\r\nin this until the fur is filled with the meal; then shake or beat it\r\nout. Repeat the working in meal and beating until the fur is clean and\r\nbright. Never put a damp skin into the meal without the gasoline bath\r\nfirst, or you will have the time of your life getting the meal out.\r\nRegular fur dressers use very fine saw dust, but meal is to be had\r\nanywhere. Plaster of paris will do, but it is most too fine. This\r\ntreatment with gasoline or benzine removes the grease and animal odors\r\nso apt to cling to Indian or home-dressed skins. After cleaning, allow\r\nthe skin to partly dry in the air and shade; then soften it by\r\nstretching, pulling and rubbing in every part. There is no way to\r\naccomplish this without work. A pad made of old bags, pieces of blanket,\r\netc., put on the beam, the skin placed on that and stretched in all\r\ndirections with the blunt edge of the fleshing knife is as good as any\r\nway. Keep up the stretching until the skin is quite dry. If any part\r\nshould dry out too fast for the operator (that is, before it gets\r\nstretched) it can be dampened with water on the flesh side and then\r\ntreated like the rest. If it is wanted extra soft the skin may be\r\nthinned down with sandpaper. If the dressed skin is wanted to lie flat\r\nas for a rug, it can be moistened on the flesh side; then stretched out\r\nand tacked fur side up on a board, the table top or the floor until dry.\r\nIf this should cause it to harden or stiffen too much break it again\r\nwithout stretching too much.\r\n\r\nAnother very good tanning solution is the following:\r\n\r\n    Salt                               1 quart\r\n    Oxalic acid (pulverized)           4 ounces\r\n    Water                              2 gallons\r\n\r\nDissolve well and immerse the skins, treating them as already directed,\r\nrinsing in clear water only. It is also best to allow a little more time\r\nfor tanning in this solution.\r\n\r\nWhile on the subject of dressing skins a few words in regard to cleaning\r\nfurs will be in order. White furs especially that have become soiled and\r\nmatted from use need cleaning frequently and are brought to the furrier\r\nor taxidermist for that purpose.\r\n\r\nA good washing in gasoline will usually remove the dirt, then dry out as\r\nin dressing furs. Furriers often use powdered magnesia for this purpose\r\nbut almost any finely divided white powder will do about as well. A long\r\nsiege of beating, shaking and brushing will be necessary to get the\r\ndrying powder all out of the fur so it will not sift out on the garments\r\nwhen wearing.\r\n\r\nIf the piece to be cleaned is large (like a coat or cloak) the lining\r\nshould be removed before cleaning. Neck pieces and small furs are\r\ncleaned with linings, wadding, etc., intact. If the fur is so matted\r\nthat beating does not fluff it out, it must be combed, using a metal fur\r\ncomb to break up the tangles.\r\n\r\nCharges for this work are based on the time used, though at least 75c.\r\nor $1.00 each is charged for the small pieces.\r\n\r\nAs chemicals exposed to the changes of atmosphere are likely to lose\r\nstrength in time, the owners of mounted heads generally take the\r\nprecaution of having them poisoned against moth at varying intervals.\r\n\r\nPersonally I think once in three years is sufficient but some prefer to\r\nbe on the safe side where valuable heads are concerned and have them\r\ntreated yearly.\r\n\r\nLarge heads like buffalo, moose, and elk may be poisoned as they hang,\r\nthus obviating any subsequent handling which would be to the detriment\r\nof both specimen and operator.\r\n\r\nHeads the size of deer and smaller are readily removed and replaced.\r\n\r\nFirst dust the head well and comb the hair or pelt to detect the\r\npresence of moth. If loose hairs reveal this the head should be removed\r\nto the open air, unscrewed from the shield and saturated with gasoline,\r\nwhich will kill both the moth and its eggs, after which poison against a\r\nrepetition of the offense.\r\n\r\nPin an old cloth or newspapers about the neck to protect the shield and\r\nwall and spray the entire skin of the head with the diluted arsenical\r\nsolution as recommended in Chapter III. Seedsmen sell a sprayer for use\r\non plants which is about the most convenient size, though the larger\r\nsize used in the vegetable garden or even a toilet atomizer will\r\ndistribute the solution.\r\n\r\nAfter it has dried wipe off the eyes and nose with a damp cloth and\r\nhandle as little as possible.\r\n\r\nThe common tariff on such work is for treating a single head not less\r\nthan $1.00. Two to four at one place, 75c. each, and over four, 50c.\r\nThis for poisoning only. Extra charges for killing moth. Such work\r\nshould be done in spring or early summer in the Central States in order\r\nto be effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nMAKING ANIMAL FUR RUGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nProbably the first use (after clothing) made of skins was as rugs or\r\ncoverings for the ground or couches, and in this shape they are still to\r\nbe found in our most elegantly furnished homes. One of the few survivals\r\nof primitive tastes.\r\n\r\nThe skins of some few animals such as Polar and Grizzly Bears, Tiger,\r\nJaguar, Lion, Puma, Leopards and Ocelots are used for little else,\r\nthough some of the spotted cats are used for eccentric looking coats and\r\nfur sets. Other smaller skins such as wolf, fox, 'coon, wild cat, etc.\r\nare much in favor as rugs as well as for garment furs.\r\n\r\nIn skinning an animal for use as a rug it is as well to skin and stretch\r\nit open, cut under side of body from chin to the end of tail and from\r\neach foot down to the central line. A large animal like bear or leopard\r\nlooks well with the paws preserved and they should be skinned down to\r\nthe last joint, leaving the claws attached to the skin. Smaller skins\r\nmay have the paws preserved, though the effect is hardly worth the\r\ntrouble and the smaller paws are easily crushed on the floor by a chance\r\nstep.\r\n\r\nAfter skinning, using care to detach it from the head without mutilating\r\nthe ears, eyes and lips, stretch flat on an inside wall, door, or table\r\ntop. Stretch evenly with tacks or small nails close together to avoid\r\ndrawing out in points and of the approximate shape of the finished rug.\r\nThat is, with the front feet well forward and hind feet pointing back,\r\nnot spread as wide as possible.\r\n\r\nIf you are intending to dress the skin it may be begun at once after\r\nskinning, as per the chapter on tanning, etc., or after fleshing it may\r\nbe put in the pickle jar against a leisure day. Otherwise stretch and\r\ndry for transportation or to send to the tanner.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HALF HEAD.\r\n\r\nHEAD WITH TEETH.\r\n\r\nPAPER HEAD FORMS--FOX]\r\n\r\nAs regards the mounting of heads for rugs, they may be done in three\r\nstyles, called half or mask head, full head closed mouth, and full head\r\nopen mouth. The first, as the name indicates, consists of the skin of\r\nthe upper part of the head without that of the lower jaw mounted over an\r\nartificial form or \"skull.\" The closed mouth (See dog) has the lower jaw\r\nmounted in addition, but without any teeth used, and the open mouth\r\nmounting requires a set of suitable teeth with the interior of the\r\nmouth, tongue and lips fully modeled and finished either with colored\r\nwax or by painting.\r\n\r\nThese artificial head forms or skulls both with and without teeth and\r\nmasks, are to be had in all varieties and several sizes each of dealers\r\nin taxidermists' supplies so cheaply that I would advise the novice to\r\nprocure them if possible. In many cases it is necessary for the\r\nprofessional to make use of skulls with artificial teeth as the natural\r\nskulls are often thrown away by the collector. In the case of any large\r\nskin intended for a rug the roughly cleaned skull should accompany same.\r\nIn ordering from dealers it is only necessary to give name of animal and\r\nthe measure of skin from center of nose to inner corner of eye, and\r\nouter corner of eye to ear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOG--CLOSED MOUTH.]\r\n\r\nThe beginner would do well to try mounting a rug with half head first\r\nand the more difficult open mouth later. A very fair mask form can be\r\nmade by laying the skinned head down on a piece of thin board and\r\nmarking around it with pencil, then cutting out to the outline. With a\r\nbunch of fine excelsior or coarse tow and a spool of thread a half-head\r\nform can be roughly blocked out by winding, using the board as a base.\r\nThen with modelling clay and chopped tow the anatomy is perfected,\r\npressing down here with the fingers, and building up elsewhere. With the\r\nskinned head to refer to as the form is modeled a good job can be done.\r\nHowever, if a number of skins of the same species are to be prepared it\r\nis best to make a mould in which unlimited paper forms may be cast.\r\nParticulars in this work are given in Chapter on Casting and Modelling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOUNDATION FOR TOW AND EXCELSIOR]\r\n\r\nThe next step in rug making after drying the pelt is to prepare the head\r\nfor mounting. It is as well to do little or no thinning down of the head\r\nskin during the tanning and even if it has been shaved down the vicinity\r\nof the eyes, ears, nose and lips will need thinning with a small sharp\r\nknife, and stretching out with a skin scraper. Before beginning this\r\nprocess the head skin should be dampened on the pelt side with clear\r\nwater (use pickle in warm weather). If the ears are not skinned before\r\ndressing they should be now, and turned inside out to the tips. A small\r\nscrew driver with the edge blunted and rounded is a good tool for this\r\nwork as it will not readily cut the thin skin of the ears.\r\n\r\nTrim and scrape away any lumps of muscle, etc., and shave down the skin\r\nenough to be molded to the surface of the form when dampened. Do not,\r\nhowever, cut away the bunch of muscles on each side of the cheeks in\r\nwhich the whisker roots are embedded, or these distinguished ornaments\r\nwill drop out. By criss-crossing these with cuts they are made as\r\nflexible as the rest of the skin. After the shaving process get a\r\nsuitable needle and stout thread and sew up any cuts or tears that have\r\nbeen made. If proper care has been used there will be little of this to\r\ndo, always remembering that a cut is not irreparable but always makes\r\nextra work. Bullet holes of large caliber destroy considerable skin and\r\nin order to close them it is best to cut them to a triangular shape and\r\ndraw together by sewing up from the corners of the triangle, as per\r\nillustration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEWING UP BULLET HOLE.]\r\n\r\nCut out from tough cardboard two ear forms a little longer at the base\r\nthan the ear skin and small enough to slip inside them readily. Before\r\ngoing further give the inside of the head and neck skin a coat of\r\npreservative. Let this lay a few minutes to soak in and then after\r\nturning the ears right side out slip the cardboard ear forms into place.\r\nThey should be coated first with liquid glue; work the skin over them\r\nwith the fingers and fill around their bases with some cut tow and clay\r\nof about the consistency of soft putty. Now place the head skin on the\r\nform, get the eyes and nose in place and drive in a few pins down the\r\ncenter of the face; they will hold it from slipping while working\r\nfurther on it. If the form is a little too short for this particular\r\nskin build it out with clay and tow, if too long it can have a trifle\r\ncut off.\r\n\r\nFill the sockets of the eyes with clay, build out the cheeks and the\r\nsides of nose with clay and tow and draw the skin of the lips down where\r\nthey belong. The glass eyes are to be cut from their wires and set,\r\ndrawing the lids around them with an awl. When they seem properly placed\r\ndrive pins at both inner and outer corners. The ears are attacked next\r\nand when arranged to suit, three or four pins driven in at their bases\r\nto hold them.\r\n\r\nOn a rug the ears should usually be laid back close to the head as by so\r\ndoing the chance of their being broken off when finished and dry is\r\nlessened. Also a mounted rug head is usually intended to register rage\r\nor anger.\r\n\r\nThe upper surface of the face being attended to, turn it upside down on\r\na folded bag or something in the nature of a cushion while we lace it\r\nacross the form with a stout thread and needle. If a hollow paper form\r\nis used it should be filled with crumpled paper, excelsior, coarse tow\r\nor similar material. Do not use fur scraps for this as I have seen done\r\nor it will be a moth nest.\r\n\r\nThe whole inside of the skin may now be poisoned after slightly\r\ndampening, and then tacked out fur side up in the proper shape to dry.\r\nIn order to make an animal skin lay flat to the floor it is necessary in\r\nmost cases to cut out several V-shaped pieces. Behind the fore legs\r\nalmost always and often in front of them, also and frequently in front\r\nof the hind legs are the places where these gores are removed.\r\nConsisting as they do of the thinly haired skin inside the legs their\r\nabsence is not noticeable when neatly sewed up.\r\n\r\nTake care in this final stretching of the rug skin to get it alike on\r\nboth sides, or, as the artists say, bilaterally symmetrical. When tacked\r\nout, go back to the face and perfect it so it may dry just right. With a\r\nfine awl point draw the upper eyelids down a little, straighten the eye\r\nbrows, lashes and whiskers, and mould the nostrils into shape, bracing\r\nthem with damp clay; when dry it is easily removed. Now set it aside\r\nuntil fully dry before proceeding with the trimming and lining. One and\r\na half or two inch wire brads are good to use in stretching skins, but\r\n3d wire lath nails will do; the longer brads are more easily handled.\r\n\r\nAfter removing the nails turn the skin on its back and draw a line from\r\nneck to tail with pencil or chalk. By measuring from points on this line\r\nwe can trim off the legs and flanks of the rug evenly. If it is a small\r\nor medium size skin it will look best with an all felt lining. So by\r\nlaying it flat on a piece of felt somewhat larger all round and marking\r\naround it at a distance of 3 inches we can cut out the lining. The edge\r\nof this is to be pinked. One end of our chopping block, usually of\r\nsycamore or oak, is kept for this function, and a few minutes work with\r\npinking iron and hammer will border the lining with neat scallops.\r\n\r\nA sufficient length of felt strips about 2 inches wide, should be cut to\r\nreach around the outside of the skin, also pinked on one edge. Allow\r\ngenerously for this as it will have to be gathered in rounding the feet\r\nand head. In the case of animals having a bushy tail or brush as the\r\nfox, wolf, etc., the tail is merely sewed up on the under side after\r\npoisoning and not lined or trimmed. Pumas, tigers and others with short\r\nfurred tails are trimmed and lined like the rest of the rug. In lining\r\nlarge rugs a double trimming of felt is often used and a lining of\r\nstrong canvas is used throughout, as when on the floor it is not\r\nvisible, protects the skin as well, and costs somewhat less.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PINKED LINING, BRIAR STITCHED.]\r\n\r\nThe trimming felt is sewed around the edge of the skin, passing the\r\nneedle through from the back obliquely, resulting in a long stitch on\r\nthe felt and a short one on the fur side. What few hairs are drawn down\r\nby this can be picked out later with a needle or awl.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEWING TRIMMING ON RUG.]\r\n\r\nBefore sewing the lining on an interlining of cotton wadding should be\r\ncut out and basted in place with a few long stitches. Now place the skin\r\nfur side up, on the lining and adjust it so an equal margin shows on all\r\nsides and pin it in several places to prevent its slipping while sewing\r\nit fast. To do this turn it felt uppermost and sew around just at the\r\nedge of the skin, in the trimming felt, reversing the stitch previously\r\nused. This hides the short stitch outside and if drawn up evenly will\r\nhardly be noticed if a color of thread has been selected corresponding\r\nsomewhat to that of the felt.\r\n\r\nIf an extra nice finish is desired the lining may be put on with a\r\ndecorative briar or cat stitch with some bright colored silkatine.\r\n\r\nBrushing away any clay from around the eyes and nose, giving the latter\r\na touch of the proper color (black for the majority of animals). A coat\r\nof thin shellac to simulate the natural moist appearance and connecting\r\nthe dried eyelids with the glass eyes with hot colored wax will about\r\ncomplete the rug. Waxing around the eyes is done with a small round\r\nartist's brush and adds to the finished appearance of a job.\r\n\r\nIn mounting a rug head with either full head, closed or open mouth, the\r\nbeginner had best use a head form from the dealer for a few times at\r\nleast. A little study of one of these will enable him to model an open\r\nmouth head, when a good set of teeth are supplied, and the ready made\r\narticle not at hand. It requires considerable time and some natural\r\nability to set the teeth and model the gums and tongue effectively.\r\n\r\nA tongue modeled with clay and tow, covered with several layers of\r\npapier mache and when dry, coated with flesh colored wax is good enough\r\nfor any rug, though museum mounting might require that the tongue be\r\nskinned and the skin used to cover the model.\r\n\r\nPlaster, putty, papier mache and various plastic cement materials are\r\nused for modeling mouths, of which papier mache is probably the best;\r\nplaster paris is often used in an emergency but is brittle and heavy.\r\nFor modeling use finely ground paper pulp mixed with glue and plaster or\r\nwhiting. Only practice and experiment will determine just the precise\r\nmixture wanted.\r\n\r\nA paper half head form may be the basis and to this wire the jaw bones\r\nwith their sets of teeth. Clever work will reproduce the interior of the\r\nmouth, gums and tongue, and when perfectly dry they should be finished\r\neither with paint or colored wax.\r\n\r\nThe tongue should have its base and lower side coated with glue and have\r\na brad driven through it into the material between the lower jaw bones.\r\nIf the head of this brad is well set in, a drop or two of wax will cover\r\nit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COYOTE RUG, OPEN MOUTH\r\n\r\n(Author's Work.)]\r\n\r\nIn preparing a skin for mounting an open mouth head the lips should be\r\npared down and preserved as far as possible as they are to be filled\r\nout and attached to the form by pinning at their edges. Common toilet\r\npins are used for this, driving them in part way and when the work is\r\ndry cutting them off close down to the surface. After this is done the\r\nlips may be waxed thus joining them to the form completely. Never fear\r\nto use plenty of pins in head mounting. In some places they may be\r\ndriven to the head and left covered by the fur, in other places where\r\nthere is little or no fur, cut them close and drive down flush.\r\n\r\nOf course greater liberties may be taken with a rug skin than one\r\nmounted entire for exhibition, still a competent artist can put a great\r\namount of expression in even a rug head. The close student of animal\r\nanatomy can produce an appalling snarl of anger on the heads of the\r\nlarger carnivora or change the same to a sleepy yawn or grin in a few\r\nminutes' manipulation.\r\n\r\nThe professional is often called in to repair damaged rugs and\r\nespecially those with open mouths. Here the operator must use his own\r\njudgment as no two seem to demand the same treatment. Missing teeth may\r\nhave to be supplied and carved from bone, celluloid or antlers. The tips\r\nof broken deer antlers make very good canine teeth and blocks of\r\ncelluloid which are much easier to shape than bone, are sold by supply\r\ndealers.\r\n\r\nI have dwelt at some length on rug making as it is a branch of taxidermy\r\nwhich seems to be always in more or less demand with the public. Also it\r\nforms an easy entrance to the more complicated mounting of complete\r\nanimals and much of the work is identical with the process of preserving\r\nheads for wall decoration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nFUR ROBES AND HOW TO MAKE THEM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile not usually classed as taxidermy the making and repairing of robes\r\nwill bring in many a dollar to the worker in the middle and northern\r\nstates. A stitch in time (on a robe) often saves more than the\r\nproverbial nine, and the better the quality the more anxious the owner\r\nto have it put in good order.\r\n\r\nThe late lamented bison furnished the robe par excellence, few of which\r\npass through the hands of the taxidermist nowadays. Their place has, in\r\nsome degree, been taken by the Galloway and other cattle hides, which\r\nalso make a practically one piece robe of good weight leather. These are\r\ntoo heavy for economical dressing by hand, but the regular tanning\r\nconcerns will dress them soft, pliable, and clean for a very reasonable\r\nprice.\r\n\r\nThe regular robe makers do much of their work with the heavy overstitch\r\nsewing machines, but it can be done as well or better by hand at the\r\nexpense of more time. Many of the smaller skins, as coyote, raccoon,\r\nfox, opossum, and wild cat make up as handsome carriage robes and sell\r\nat remunerative prices.\r\n\r\nSkins of an inferior lustre or that are mutilated are often used. For\r\ninstance, the skin of the head may be mounted separately and not\r\ninterfere with using the balance in a robe. For use in a robe skins\r\nshould be taken off open and stretched in a rectangular shape as near as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nAfter tanning, sew up all cuts and holes in the skins, dampen the flesh\r\nside with clear water and tack out fur side down on the floor, table\r\ntop, or better still on light boards cleated together which may be set\r\non edge against the wall out of the way. In all sewing on rugs and robes\r\nbe sure and use a substantial thread well drawn up, fine stitches are\r\nnot essential but good material is, as such things come in for a deal of\r\nrough use unlike mounted specimens which are, or should be seldom\r\nhandled. Glovers triangular needles and gilling or carpet thread of\r\nsuitable sizes are the necessary tools.\r\n\r\nSkins of approximately the same size should be used in making up a robe\r\nor the effect will be bad. After stretching and drying, cut them to\r\nrectangular shape, taking care to get the darker line down the back in\r\nthe center of each. A good way is to cut a piece of cardboard to the\r\nrequired size and mark around it. Gaps in front of and behind the legs\r\nmay be filled by sewing in small pieces rather than cut down the skins\r\ntoo much. The drawing shows coon skin marked to cut for robe. The skin\r\nis poorly stretched yet there are many even worse, altho trappers are\r\nlearning to handle the skins in better shape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COON MARKED TO CUT FOR ROBE]\r\n\r\nAfter the necessary number of skins are cut out they are sewed together\r\nin rows and the rows in turn sewed to each other like a patchwork quilt,\r\ntaking care to have the fur all run the same way. The robe should now be\r\ndampened again and stretched and tacked to its full extent to remove any\r\nwrinkles and flatten the seams. This sewing is all done from the back of\r\nthe robe using an even over-hand stitch. Just before the final\r\nstretching it is well to apply arsenical solution to the damp skins.\r\n\r\nOn drying it is ready for the trimming and lining. Sometimes it is\r\nnecessary to turn over the upper edge of the skins and baste it down or\r\nit may show the raw edge of the hides on account of the fur laying all\r\none way.\r\n\r\nStrips of felt 3 in. wide, pinked on one edge are used for trimming, and\r\nmay be had from the dealers, ready to use, or we can buy the felt by the\r\nyard and easily pink it in the work room. Any one doing much robe work\r\nwould find a pinking machine (price about $5.00) a good investment, but\r\nthe small hand iron does just as good work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STRONG HIDE (CATTLE) LAP ROBE.]\r\n\r\nA double border of contrasting colors may be used, the upper strip of\r\nwhich should be 3/4 inch narrower. The border is sewed on from the back\r\nwith heavy thread, using the same stitch as that for the lining rugs. An\r\ninterlining of cotton wadding is basted in place before the lining is\r\nsewed on. Plush or beaver cloth is to be had in 54 and 60 inch widths\r\nand a variety of colors, of which the darker greens, browns, and blacks\r\nare to be preferred.\r\n\r\nFur robes are usually 48×60; 54×66; 60×70; or 60×84 inches in size, so\r\nlinings of the above widths cut without waste.\r\n\r\nSingle cattle or horse hides may be left with the edges merely\r\nstraightened or they may be cut and pieced to regular robe shape. The\r\nbushy tails of such animals as wolf or fox are sometimes used along one\r\nside or both ends as a fringe.\r\n\r\nThe number of skins required to make a robe are as follows:\r\n\r\n    Raccoon                    12 to 20\r\n    Coyote, wolf or dog         6 to 10\r\n    Wild cat                   12 to 16\r\n    Woodchuck or opossum       20 to 30\r\n    Goat                        4 to  8\r\n\r\nBaby carriage robes of angora or lamb skins are lined with quilted satin\r\nand trimmed with felt of some light shade. They usually have either an\r\nopening for the head and shoulders or a pocket for the feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COYOTE LAP ROBE, 8 SKINS.\r\n\r\nNote tails in center.]\r\n\r\nThe natives of Patagonia make up many robes of the guanaco and vicuna,\r\ndressing the skins and sewing them together with sinew. Their dressing\r\nis faulty as the skins are apt to stiffen and crack and the sinew\r\nhardens with time until it becomes like wire, though the stitching is\r\nwonderfully even. They have, however, worked out a scheme of joining the\r\nskins in a way to eliminate waste, that is far ahead of civilized fur\r\nworkers. A row of skins are joined head to tail and the next row headed\r\nthe opposite way will fit in perfectly, the legs being left on the\r\nskins. The sketch with this will explain better than any description.\r\nThe guanaco pelt being of a woolly nature makes it unnecessary to run it\r\nall the same way and the entire skins are utilized in spite of their\r\nungainly shape, the flaps and tabs trimmed off filling the indentations\r\naround the outer edge of the robe. They make an excellent camp blanket\r\nas light and warm as the malodorous, hairy rabbit skin robe of Hudsons\r\nBay, and no Patagonian ranch house bed is complete without its guanaco\r\ncoverlet.\r\n\r\nYou will likely be called on to repair robes much oftener than to make\r\nthem and such work is nearly all profit, as it generally consists in\r\nsewing up rips and tears in the skins. Never attempt to do this from the\r\nfront or fur side as it can only be done right from the back. To do this\r\nat least one side of the lining will have to be ripped and the robe\r\nturned, turning it back and resewing it on completion. Linings are\r\nturned under at the edges all around.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PATAGONIAN ROBE OF GUANACO SKINS.]\r\n\r\nWorn and soiled linings and trimming often need replacing with new\r\nmaterial and it is sometimes necessary to purchase an unlined goat\r\n\"plate\" to repair robes of that common variety. Worn robes can be cut\r\ndown in size if no similar material is to be had for repairs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nMOUNTING ENTIRE SMALL FUR ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Chapters VI and VIII directions are given for skinning and preparing\r\nthis class of animals for mounting, so with the skin properly cleaned\r\nand poisoned before us the next thing is to cut the wires for a\r\nsupporting frame. These are six in number usually, body wire, tail wire\r\nand one for each leg. The body wire is about one-half longer than from\r\nnose to base of tail; tail wire the length of the tail bone and half the\r\nbody, and each leg wire twice the length of the leg.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of using a muskrat for an initial attempt as it is of a\r\nconvenient size to handle and the length of its fur will hide small\r\ndefects in the anatomy. Most books of instruction select a squirrel for\r\nthe beginner's victim. It is true it is not as difficult as a hairless\r\nMexican terrier but it is apt to discourage the learner. An opossum will\r\ndo very well or any long haired animal of about that size.\r\n\r\nWe will first reconstruct a hind leg and if it is a fresh specimen being\r\nmounted without a bath in the pickle we can have the opposite leg in the\r\nflesh to guide, as to proper proportions. The wire is passed through the\r\ncut in the bottom of the foot and along the back of the leg bones where\r\nit is secured in about three places by tying with small cord. The end is\r\nleft projecting three inches beyond the end of the upper leg bone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIND AND FRONT LEG OF MUSKRAT WRAPPED READY TO CLAY AND\r\nRETURN TO SKIN.]\r\n\r\nThe muscles and flesh are replaced by winding on tow with stout thread\r\nuntil the approximate size is reached, when the surface is given a thin\r\ncoating of clay and the leg is drawn back into its skin. The fore legs\r\nare in the same manner built to the joint with the shoulder blade.\r\n\r\nAfter sharpening the tail wire to a point it is wound with fine tow and\r\nthread and coated with clay until it duplicates the bone and flesh\r\nremoved. This is slipped into the tail sheath with the unwound end\r\nprojecting into the body and the slit along the lower side of tail sewed\r\nup.\r\n\r\nAfter making a ring about the diameter of a .22 shell on one end of the\r\nbody wire place it on your sketch where the hip joint was marked,\r\nletting the wire run lengthwise of the body. Another ring similar is\r\nmade at the shoulder. These form the points of attachment for the legs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WIRING FOR SMALL ANIMALS, FRONT LEG WIRES TWISTED TO BACK\r\nWIRE.]\r\n\r\nThe skull, cleaned of flesh and poisoned, should have the muscles\r\nreplaced with tow and the whole coated with clay. Force a piece of cork\r\ninto the opening at the back of the skull. Sharpen the end of body wire\r\nand force it through the cork and out one of the nostrils. The skull is\r\npushed back along the wire until it reaches the proper distance from the\r\nshoulder ring, when all but an inch or so of the projecting wire is cut\r\noff.\r\n\r\nInsert the skull through the body opening and work it up the neck into\r\nits place in the head skin, letting the end of wire go through the\r\nnostril of skin also. This will hold the nose in place. Adjust the eyes\r\nand ears also.\r\n\r\nNow pass the ends of leg wire through the rings from their opposite\r\nsides. The tail wire is passed through the rear ring and twisted around\r\nthe body wire a few times. The ends of leg wires projecting through the\r\nring cross, so twist them together a turn or two with pliers, next bring\r\nthem down and under the body wire, twisting them together, first one\r\nside of it and then the other. This treatment will fasten the legs and\r\ntail also firmly to the body wire.\r\n\r\nThus we have the skin with head, tail and legs filled out and the\r\nsupporting wires fastened together. The remainder of filling, usually\r\nchopped tow, is placed with fingers, forceps, and stuffers. First a good\r\nlayer next the skin all around, then part this and fill in the center a\r\nlittle at a time, first at one end, then the other. Put a good cushion\r\nat the hips and shoulders between the wires and the skin and also at the\r\nback. Fill out the neck well but do not stretch it unduly.\r\n\r\nBegin sewing up at both ends of the opening cut, drawing a few stitches\r\nup and tying the thread while you fill a little more. Model the animal\r\ninto shape from time to time by pressure with your hands and when filled\r\nout and sewed up tie the threads together.\r\n\r\nOur animal is now lying on its back with head, tail and limbs extended;\r\nbend them into some natural position and set it on its feet. It may be\r\nwell to force a little chopped tow and clay into the bottoms of the feet\r\nand draw the cuts in them together with a few stitches around the leg\r\nwire projecting from them.\r\n\r\nA temporary stand of a piece of board supported on cleats at each end is\r\nprepared and a number of holes bored for the leg wires. A little\r\nexperimenting will find the proper place for these when the surplus ends\r\nof wire are bent along the bottom of the board and fastened with\r\nstaples. Complete the head and face modeling now, filling out the cheeks\r\nand lips and pinning them in place. Work the skin around the eyes and\r\nears into proper place and fasten with pins.\r\n\r\nFill eye sockets with sufficient clay and set the eyes, drawing the lids\r\ndown where they belong.\r\n\r\nAny deficiencies at the back of the head can be filled through the ears.\r\nIn the case of a muskrat the ears are so insignificant that they only\r\nneed a little clay and tow forced into them to hold them in place. More\r\nprominent ears as those of fox, 'coon, or wild cat must be filled with a\r\npasteboard form, cut the proper size and shape, coated with liquid glue\r\nand inserted from the inside before returning the skull to the skin. The\r\nears of all animals should be pocketed when skinned, that is turned\r\ninside out to their tips to admit preservatives and later some filling\r\nmaterial which will retain their shape when dry.\r\n\r\nDo not skin out and throw away the ear cartilage but leave it adhering\r\nto the skin of the inner side of the ear. Without it this skin is very\r\nfrail and brittle and thorough pickling will prevent shrinkage and\r\ndistortion of the ear.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the head push it slightly towards the body on the wire\r\nand cut same close to end of nose. Pull head back to place, the wire\r\ndisappears up the nose about 1/4 inch, then you can shape the nostrils\r\nand fill so they will not shrivel up in drying and look as though their\r\nowner had been a mouth breather.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OPOSSUM MOUNTED IN WALKING POSITION.]\r\n\r\nIf the general pose and appearance seem correct finish up by placing the\r\nfeet and toes correctly. Nothing gives a mounted animal a more trampish,\r\ndisreputable appearance than slouchy, run over feet with toes that don't\r\nseem to be on the job. Lastly comb the fur out and fluff it up before\r\nsetting away to dry.\r\n\r\nAnimals up to the coyote in size are usually mounted by similar methods\r\nto the preceding. Sometimes a piece of board is substituted for the body\r\nwire, especially in the larger specimens, the wires to which are too\r\nheavy to clinch readily. The skull is on a separate neck wire and all\r\nwires are fastened to the back board by passing through holes and then\r\nstapling.\r\n\r\nOf course it is possible to mount small specimens by the same methods\r\nmost large ones are, by drawing the skin over a hard filling, in fact a\r\nstatuette, which must be made to fit the skin. This method in the case\r\nof small animals requires so much time that it is impossible in ordinary\r\ncommercial work.\r\n\r\nStrive to put your mounted animals in easy natural poses unless you are\r\nmaking a grotesque, in which case go the length.\r\n\r\nClean the eyes and teeth with a brush when dry, and beat the fur to make\r\nit stand out. Fasten securely on whatever form of mounting you have\r\ndecided on, countersinking the wires on the under side. Accessories, as\r\na piece of food in the mouth or paws, are added now if they have been\r\nprepared for.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAT SITTING AND WATCHING]\r\n\r\nA slip with record of the specimen written on it and pasted to the under\r\nside of stand will usually be appreciated. If the mouth is wanted open\r\nit should be braced in that position, the lips, etc., held in place by\r\nclay. When it is dry this can be dug out with awls and modelling tools\r\nand the tongue, gums, and inside the mouth modelled in mache or some\r\nplaster composition. The tongue may be modelled in connection with the\r\nlower part of the mouth or made separately and fastened in place with a\r\nbrad and some glue.\r\n\r\nColored wax, pink for the inside and black for the lips, applied hot\r\nwith a little brush in several coats finish the open mouth. A little\r\nblack wax will join the eyelids to the glass eyes if they have shrunk\r\naway and the inside of the nostrils should be coated with a little pink.\r\nBare skin on the end of the nose should be varnished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nMOUNTING LARGE ANIMALS ENTIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough at one time nearly all animals were mounted by the soft body or\r\nstuffing method as described in the previous chapter, very few of the\r\nlarger ones are so treated now. An adequate frame is built in a body of\r\nthe proper size and proportions, the surface of which reproduces those\r\nmuscles lying next the skin. The skin, well pared down and poisoned, is\r\nsewed, pinned and glued to this surface.\r\n\r\nIn the small specimen clay was used next the skin in places to perfect\r\nthe modelling, but such amounts would be required for a large animal as\r\nto affect the durability of the skin. Clay and plaster being in a dry\r\nstate very absorbent, will eventually rob of all oily matter any skin in\r\ncontact with them. Such skins will crack, split and finally disintegrate\r\nas thoroughly as those having an excess of fat adhering to them.\r\n\r\nTo prevent this a layer of some glue composition or paper is used just\r\nbeneath the skin. As an example in this mode of mounting a black bear\r\nwould answer nicely. If the leg bones are attached to the skin they may\r\nbe unjointed at the toes and laid aside while the skin is well shaved\r\ndown on its entire inner surface. A thoroughly flexible skin is entirely\r\nat the command of the taxidermist, one stiff or hard cannot be placed or\r\nkept in place at will.\r\n\r\nAfter beaming, splitting the lips and nose cartilage, pocketing the ears\r\nand sewing up cuts and tears, the skin is dropped in the pickle. An\r\noutline sketch is made with chalk on the shop floor and on this the\r\nbones of the legs are arranged. A stiff wire bent along the back of each\r\nset of leg bones will guide us in bending the iron rods used as\r\nsupports. These should be from 5/16 to 1/2 inch in diameter, threaded\r\nand fitted with two nuts at the lower end and eighteen inches or so\r\nlonger than the leg bones themselves.\r\n\r\nOf this extra length, enough is allowed below the feet to fasten to the\r\npedestal, the balance is bent in a right angle from the end of the upper\r\nleg bone. At the distance of the hip joint from the central line of the\r\nbody it is bent again parallel with the back board; for a hind leg. The\r\nfront leg rods are bent in the same way at the joining of the shoulder\r\nblade with the humerus or upper bone of the front leg. You will readily\r\nsee the desirability of preserving at least one set each of the hind and\r\nfront leg bones. In such case the missing bones can be roughly blocked\r\nout of wood to the proper dimensions, while if none are saved you will\r\nhave to do the same depending on the skin for measurements.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRAME FOR BEAR MANIKIN.]\r\n\r\nThe end of the rods lying along the back should be bent again in a V\r\nshape to prevent their turning when fastened to it. The location of the\r\nhip and shoulder joints are marked on one side of the back board, the\r\nrods for that side laid in place and fastened by drilling holes each\r\nside of them and passing loops of stout wire through and twisting them\r\ntightly on the other side with heavy pliers. The rods for the other side\r\nare fastened in the same manner, in fact they may be fastened with the\r\nsame wires, but it will be stronger if the fastenings are separate. The\r\nleg bones are bound fast to the rods with wire or twine.\r\n\r\nHolding the back board in the vise by the middle the leg rods with bone\r\nattached are adjusted to the position of the finished specimen. The\r\nthreaded ends which project below the feet are bent straight down.\r\n\r\nA rough pedestal of boards on 2×4 cleats at each end, is made, the frame\r\nplaced on it and marking where the rods will enter, bore suitable holes\r\nto receive them. One nut is turned up each rod a short distance and\r\nafter inserting in the holes in the pedestal the others are screwed up\r\ntightly from below.\r\n\r\nOur frame now stands alone and rigid and should be viewed from all sides\r\nto correct any errors. It should not be too high, front or rear, and\r\nalso having the back-board perfectly vertical or plumb. Insert two\r\npieces of rod in the opening at the back of the skull and fasten them\r\nthere by mixing enough plaster of paris and water to fill the cavity, to\r\nthe consistency of molasses and pouring it in around them.\r\n\r\nThe ends of the rods should be bent or roughened to prevent them\r\nslipping out after the plaster has set. A surplus of plaster can be\r\nplaced around the articulation of the jaws, at the same time holding\r\nthem in place. These neck rods are to run beside and be fastened to the\r\nback-board as the legs were.\r\n\r\nLet one remain straight and fasten it loosely so it may be drawn in and\r\nout the loops until the proper length of neck is formed, then tighten\r\nthem and fasten the other rod also. Before fastening these try the skin\r\nover the frame, making sure it will cover in all directions. A tail wire\r\nstapled to the top of the back-board completes the frame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOLTING LEG RODS TO STAND.]\r\n\r\nIf two good sized rectangular holes are cut in the back-board just in\r\nfront of the hind legs and behind the shoulders they will be useful\r\nlater in shaping the body by sewing back and forth with a mattress\r\nneedle and cord. Drive a row of lath nails into the top and bottom edges\r\nof the back-board about half their length at 2 inch intervals. They will\r\nenable you to build up first one side, then the other of the body by\r\nwinding down excelsior with wrapping cord. These nails are driven fully\r\nin when the winding is finished.\r\n\r\nThe limbs also are built up by using the same material. Do not build up\r\nany part to a perfect fit yet, however, as we must leave room for a\r\nshell of paper 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Depressions in body and limbs are\r\nreproduced by sewing from side to side or drawing down with nails.\r\n\r\nThe neck and skull are built up in much the same way and the skin\r\nfitting loosely, the manikin is surfaced up with a coat of soft\r\nmodelling clay well rubbed in with a small trowel. The paper coating is\r\nto be applied while the clay is still damp so a large specimen must be\r\npartly covered with a damp cloth to prevent it drying out prematurely.\r\n\r\nThe paper for this purpose should be of some soft easily pulped variety;\r\ncommon building paper is good and may be torn in pieces of various size,\r\nsoaked in water 15 minutes, then squeezed out and coated on both sides\r\nwith paste. This is applied to the surface of the figure, the edges\r\noverlapping slightly, until completely covered. Use paper of a different\r\ncolor for each alternate coat to insure its completion. Five or six\r\ncoats will be sufficient when it may be left to dry, after which treat\r\nit to a good coat of shellac.\r\n\r\nThe skin is withdrawn from the pickle, rinsed in soda solution, put\r\nthrough the benzine and meal drying and coated on the entire inner\r\nsurface with preservative. Glue coated ear forms are slipped into place\r\nand fastened by long stitches back and forth through the ears. The feet\r\nand bases of ears are filled with papier mache pulp and the surface of\r\nthe manikin coated with liquid glue.\r\n\r\nNow the skin is put on the form to stay, fastening down the central line\r\nof the back with wire brads and drawn together at the junction of legs\r\nand body with stout stitches. The legs are sewn up first and the opening\r\ncut of the body last. A surplus of skin may be worked out and\r\ndistributed with the point of an awl, while it may be pulled and\r\nstretched to cover a shortage in another point without changing the\r\nanimal's form in the least.\r\n\r\nThe ears are pinned in place and their bases distended by tow pressed in\r\nwith stuffers. Pointed wires thrust through the openings of the ears\r\ninto the skull will hold them in place until dry.\r\n\r\nThe nose, lips and around the eyes are correctly placed, filling\r\nslightly between the skin and paper if necessary, use plenty of common\r\npins to hold the skin in place. They are either drawn or cut off flush\r\nin short-haired skins when dry, but in one like the bear they may be\r\ndriven to the head and left so.\r\n\r\nAny places not inclined to stay put may be clamped down with strips of\r\ncardboard pinned on. The glass eyes should be placed now before setting\r\naway to dry, which will require some time.\r\n\r\nWhen dry any bare patches of skin will have a dead appearance and\r\nrequire painting with oil colors thinned with turpentine to reduce the\r\ngloss. The end of the nose and lips are touched with varnish to produce\r\nthe natural moist appearance.\r\n\r\nIf mounted with open mouth this is modelled in paper and wax coated as\r\nalready described. The fur which should have been nicely combed after\r\nmounting will need another brushing and the animal is ready for removal\r\nto a permanent mount or pedestal. Some little judgment can be displayed\r\nin this selection as a poor, rough mounting will detract from the\r\nappearance of the best work while a specimen far below the average will\r\npass muster with tasteful and suitable surroundings. The same principles\r\nwill apply with some exceptions in mounting about all large animals.\r\n\r\nSome of the most ponderous have a hollow wooden frame made to reduce the\r\nbulk of filling required; this is covered with wooden strips or lath and\r\nthis in turn with a layer of fibrous material.\r\n\r\nSupporting rods more than 1/2 inch in diameter must have both ends\r\nthreaded and be connected with the back-board by iron squares. These\r\nconsist of a rectangular piece of iron, bent at right angles and drilled\r\nwith a number of holes in both flanges. One set of these is for screwing\r\nto the back-board while the others are of a size to receive the upper\r\nend of the leg rod. By changing these from one hole to another it is\r\npossible to vary the distance somewhat between the front and hind legs\r\nwithout moving the iron squares on the back-board.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FASTENING RODS TO BACK WITH IRON SQUARES.]\r\n\r\nSometimes the hair will be found missing in one or more places on a\r\nfinished animal and in such case \"Old Dr. Le Page's Liquid Hair\r\nRestorer\" is the only remedy. The place to be covered is coated with\r\nglue and a small tuft of hair from the same or another skin grasped with\r\na forceps, the base touched with glue and carefully placed. The hair is\r\narranged with a setting needle before the glue hardens, and though a\r\ntedious operation it may be performed so well as to defy detection.\r\n\r\nAnother way where the hair or fur is of some length is to procure a\r\npatch of the right size with hair matching that surrounding, shaving the\r\nhide thin, coating the back with glue and pinning on the bare spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nMOUNTING HEADS OF SMALL ANIMALS, BIRDS AND FISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting collections which the average nature lover\r\ncan make is of the heads of small game. The expense is smaller than\r\nwhere the entire subject is preserved, they occupy but little room, and\r\nare easily kept in good order.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILD CAT HEAD MOUNTED ON SHIELD.]\r\n\r\nHeads of small fur bearers are all mounted in about the same way. In\r\nskinning split down the back of neck from between the ears to base of\r\nneck, cut around neck in front of shoulders and turn the scalp wrong\r\nside out over the head, put it through the usual pickling, paring,\r\ncleaning and poisoning. If ears are pocketed and lips split before\r\npickling it may prevent the loss of hair and epidermis, in warm weather\r\nespecially. Clean the skull if the head is to be mounted with open\r\nmouth. If the skull is not to be had, the teeth are broken, or you are\r\nin a great hurry, use an artificial form with the interior of the mouth\r\nalready modelled.\r\n\r\nEnlarge the opening at the back of skull and insert a piece of board not\r\nwider than the depth of neck from top to bottom. Drill a hole in top of\r\nskull and drive a screw into the board into the board inside skull\r\ncavity, prop the lower jaw open the desired distance and fill around its\r\narticulations and the base of skull around neck board with freshly mixed\r\nplaster of paris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOX HEAD SKINNED AND ON NECK STANDARD.]\r\n\r\nWhen this hardens the skull with open jaws is firmly fixed on end of\r\nneck board. Fasten neck board in vise and mark where to saw off,\r\nallowing for a piece of 1/2 inch board shaped like a cross section of\r\nthe neck. If an artificial form is used, screw it to the neck board and\r\ntreat the same otherwise.\r\n\r\nMake the neck short rather than long with the nose lower than the eyes\r\nin most cases. Build up neck and head by winding on tow. Mount and\r\nfinish the head as directed in rug work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEOPARD HEAD, ARTIFICIAL.]\r\n\r\nThe skin may be fastened at the end of neck by pins or brads driven all\r\naround the neck. Trim off any surplus with a knife, cutting from inside\r\nthe skin to prevent cutting off ends of fur.\r\n\r\nIf a skin has been ripped up the front to the chin careful sewing will\r\nmake it presentable, though such seams are hard to conceal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAWK HEAD.]\r\n\r\nThe heads of birds of prey and the larger game birds show up well\r\nmounted and need no special treatment from that generally given. The\r\nneck only is made up on a wire, one end of which is sharpened to thrust\r\nthrough the skull while the other is stapled or clinched to a bit of\r\nboard round or oval shape. The skin of the base of neck is fastened to\r\nthis by sewing back and forth across the back. Heads of fish like bass\r\nand pike are prepared by cutting off just back of the gills and cleaning\r\nfrom the back all brains and flesh.\r\n\r\nAfter poisoning, fill them with tow or cotton, bracing the mouth open if\r\nwanted so and keep in the desired position until dry. Then the fibrous\r\nfilling is removed and they are filled permanently with plaster or paper\r\npulp and a piece of board fastened in the back of head to furnish a hold\r\nfor screws from the back of the shield or panel.\r\n\r\nThe inside of the mouth will need remodelling with wax and the whole\r\ngiven a coat of white varnish. Any bright colors which may have faded\r\nshould be retouched with oil colors before varnishing.\r\n\r\nSuitable mounts for small heads are in the regular shield and round and\r\noval shapes, and rustic panels of natural wood. A number of small heads\r\nmay be mounted on one long panel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nMOUNTING HEADS OF LARGE GAME.\r\n\r\n\r\nMounting heads, of horned game especially, is a branch of taxidermy\r\nwhich suffers no diminution in popularity. Such work is turned out at\r\nthe present time in far better shape than it was years ago, but many\r\nfine heads still remain that were gathered in days of abundance of\r\nbuffalo, elk and mountain sheep.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHEEP HEAD.]\r\n\r\nIn skinning horned heads never open the skin up the front of the neck;\r\nnot only are such seams difficult to hide but the skull with antlers\r\ncannot be entirely removed from the skin as it should be.\r\n\r\nTo do this open the skin down the center of the back of the neck from\r\njust back of the horns to the shoulders or at least half that distance.\r\nA neck of medium length is preferable and many a fine head has been\r\nruined by being cut off just back of the ears.\r\n\r\nConnect the upper end of the opening cut with the base of each horn or\r\nantler by a short branch making the whole opening of a Y or T shape.\r\nTurn the neck skin inside out down over the head, which in case of a\r\ndeer may rest on the antlers, until the ears are reached, cut these off\r\nnot too close to the head and the horns are next met with.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKINNING HORNED HEADS. CUT ON HEAVY LINES.]\r\n\r\nWork the skin from around the base of these with a dull knife or a small\r\nscrewdriver blade. With the same tool pry the thick skin away from the\r\nfrontal bone. When the eyes are reached have a care not to cut their\r\nlids, working closer to the bone than the skin. Use the screwdriver\r\nagain to scoop up the skin from the so-called tear pits in front of the\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nLet all the dark colored skin on the inside of the lips remain attached\r\nto them. The skin of the neck is the thickest on the whole animal and\r\nmust be reduced by shaving. The skin of the whole head and neck should\r\nnot only be freed from all flesh and muscle but shaved to about one-half\r\nits original thickness. For this purpose work on it with a sharp knife\r\nor draw shave on a half rounded beam.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORNED HEADS--ANTELOPE, DEER.]\r\n\r\nSplit the lips and remove their fleshy interior, split the nose\r\ncartilage and separate it from the outer skin. With some blunt tool pry\r\nthe skin of the back of the ear from the cartilage and turn the ears\r\nwrong side out to their tips. Give the scalp at least 24 hours' pickling\r\nor it will be liable to excessive shrinkage on drying.\r\n\r\nMany a fine head mounted green, without thinning or pickling, has shrunk\r\nand continued to shrink for months, until all stitches gave way and it\r\ncracked and shriveled to an inglorious end. If a paper head form is to\r\nbe used, the top of the skull at the base of the antlers is sawn off and\r\nthe balance of the skull discarded, the more common method will require\r\nthe cleaning of the skull with antlers remaining on it. A little boiling\r\nwill expedite this and by chopping an opening (1-1/2 inches wide in case\r\nof a deer) into the lower part of the brain cavity the brain is removed.\r\nThis opening will also receive the end of a wooden neck standard of\r\nplank three inches wide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEER SKULL ON STANDARD.]\r\n\r\nA nail through the top of skull will hold it temporarily till the lower\r\njaw bones are placed and the whole held solid by packing the base of\r\nskull and jaws in a mass of soft plaster which will harden in a few\r\nminutes. This neck standard should be at right angles to the greatest\r\nlength of the head.\r\n\r\nMeasuring the neck skin where cut off gives the circumference of an\r\negg-shaped board, representing a cross section of the neck at that point\r\nin a vertical line. The neck standard is sawed off at the proper place\r\nand angle and made fast to the board by nails and screws. With a very\r\nshort neck it will be necessary to depress the nose considerably that\r\nthe antlers may not come in contact with the wall. This should all be\r\ncalculated before fixing the skull permanently on the neck standard. The\r\nstandard can be held in the vise and a little measuring will indicate\r\nthe point of attachment and angle needed to clear the wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NECK BOARD.]\r\n\r\nNow wind excelsior on the neck standard and skull until the skinned head\r\nand neck are roughly reproduced. Try the skin on occasionally to guide\r\nin this.\r\n\r\nDo not put any excelsior on the upper part of the skull and face as no\r\namount of flesh was removed there. Give the cheeks a natural fullness\r\nand remember the neck was not round like a stove pipe. By sewing from\r\nside to side the shape of the gullet and wind pipe can be molded. When\r\nthe skin is still not quite filled give the head and neck a coating of\r\npotter's (or modelling) clay and then several coats of well pasted paper\r\nas directed for covering manikins for large animals.\r\n\r\nWhen this has completely dried out remove skin from pickle, clean and\r\npoison it and after placing the ear forms it will be ready to cover the\r\nhead and neck. I prefer good cardboard forms for the ears though some\r\nuse only metal. Lead is too clumsy and heavy, copper and wire cloth\r\ncorrode, pure sheet tin works nicely but is expensive.\r\n\r\nThe form should receive a couple coats of liquid glue before the skin is\r\nput on to stay. Fasten the skin in front of the eyes with a brad and\r\ndraw into place about the base of the antlers. Use a heavy needle and\r\nwaxed linen cord for this sewing. Heavy gilling twine doubled will do.\r\n\r\nSew up from first one and then the other antler to the central cut down\r\nthe back of the neck, tie the threads together and continue sewing down\r\nthe neck. Get the skin on face and around mouth placed, then draw the\r\nneck skin tight and nail to the edge of the board with finishing brads\r\nan inch or more long. Any surplus remaining can be trimmed away. A\r\nsquare of rough board, screwed on the end of the neck, will enable it to\r\nstand on the bench with nose up while the final touches are put on the\r\nanatomy of the head and face.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAPER HEAD AND EAR FORMS.]\r\n\r\nThe split lips filled with a little clay are placed and will usually\r\nstay without pinning if the lower lips are tucked under where they\r\nbelong. Fill the end of the nose and around the nostrils nicely, no live\r\ndeer ever had a shriveled up nose. Fill under the eyebrows as the skin\r\nthere was quite thick before paring. Set the eyes, after filling sockets\r\nwith clay. A little work with a sharp awl will put the lids in place\r\nwith lashes disposed aright. If the ears have not been permanently\r\nfixed, do so now filling out their bases with stuffers and thrusting\r\nstout wires into the head to keep them set until dry. A few stitches are\r\ntaken to hold the skin of both sides of the ears together, when dry they\r\nare removed. Brush the hair down and if it persists in rough spots,\r\npaste them and then smooth down. When dry the comb and brush will remove\r\nthe scales of paste readily along with any dirt from the hair. When dry\r\nclean the antlers and oil them lightly, brush out the hair and clean all\r\nclay from eyes and nose. Connect the eyes and lids with black wax, model\r\nthe inside of nostrils with cream or pink wax and varnish the end of\r\nnose and any bare lip that may show. Pins and brads that will show are\r\ndrawn out and others cut off level with the skin. The head which has\r\nhung drying on the rough board may be removed to a finished shield as\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FINISHED HEAD.\r\n\r\n(Author's work.)]\r\n\r\nThe paper form method has numerous advantages but is not always\r\nconvenient to procure. It will save the beginner much tedious work and\r\ngreatly expedite matters for the professional. These forms as supplied\r\nby dealers are of the entire head and neck. By cutting off the neck at\r\nthe proper point, nailing in the neck board and screwing the plate of\r\nbone at the base of the antlers to a block in the top of head it is\r\nready to receive the skin. It will require but a short time for the skin\r\nto dry on this foundation so the finished head is often ready to return\r\nat the end of a week.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PAPER HEAD FORMS FOR ELK AND DEER HEADS.]\r\n\r\nFor a number of years I have used a modification of this process. In\r\nthis the form is cast in halves which are joined on a board cut to the\r\noutline of the head and neck. This will afford a secure attachment for\r\nthe antlers and in addition the skin of the neck may be nailed securely\r\neach side of the opening cut, making any ripping or opening by shrinkage\r\nat that point forever impossible.\r\n\r\nThese paper forms may be bought or made in various sizes, so by the\r\naddition of a small amount of some modelling material any skin is\r\nfitted. With a supply of them on hand work can be turned out rapidly\r\nduring the busy season.\r\n\r\nThese directions for mounting will apply equally in case of moose, elk\r\nor other large game heads, always providing supports adequate for the\r\nlarger animals. A mounted head with insufficient and wabbly mechanical\r\nconstruction is not a joy forever.\r\n\r\nThe head of a common sheep or ram is a good one for the beginner, as its\r\ncoat of wool covers small defects. It is a convenient size to handle and\r\nif not entirely successful no great expense has been incurred. On the\r\nother hand a fairly mounted ram's head is quite ornamental and suitable,\r\nespecially on the wall of a country house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nMOUNTING HORNS AND ANTLERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA neatly mounted set of antlers or horns are an ornament anywhere, in\r\nthe home, office or public room, and in case any one of the out-o'-door\r\nfraternity wishes to try setting up a pair, I will give a few simple\r\ndirections and hints which may be helpful. Some bits of lumber, screws,\r\nplaster of paris, plush or leather, tacks, etc., are about all the\r\nmaterials needed; also a one-fourth inch drill bit to make the necessary\r\nholes in the frontal bone.\r\n\r\nBy sawing off the top of the skull down to the eyes we separate the\r\nantlers and the frontal bone on which they grow, from the rest of the\r\nskull.\r\n\r\nCare should be taken to leave the same amount of bone on each side, so\r\nthe antlers will be the same distance from the wall.\r\n\r\nFor antlers of small or medium size eastern deer, cut a heart-shaped\r\nblock about 4×5 inches from a piece of soft 7/8-inch board. The edges of\r\nthis should be slightly beveled toward one side. This may be cut out in\r\nits finished shape with a keyhole saw, or roughed out with a hand saw,\r\nand trimmed up with a draw knife or wood rasp.\r\n\r\nAfter drilling two or three holes in the plate of bone attached to the\r\nantlers, arrange them evenly on this block and screw fast, using screws\r\nwhich will not protrude from the back of the block. If the bone is\r\nuneven or the antlers do not hang right, small pieces of wood may be\r\ninserted at one side or the other until the desired effect is had. Now\r\nput a half pint of water in some old dish and mix in plaster of paris\r\nuntil it is like very thin putty. With an old knife you can spread this\r\nover the bone and round it up nearly to the burr of the antlers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIf the first mixing is not enough, mix a little more, for if too much\r\nplaster is put on anywhere it can be easily scraped off before it gets\r\ndry. This needs to be put on quickly as the plaster soon \"sets\" or\r\nhardens and in fifteen or twenty minutes it can be scraped and trimmed\r\nto a smooth, rounding surface.\r\n\r\nFor covering this wood and plaster base, plush, soft leather or\r\npantasote is used. Plush or velvet is the easiest to apply for a\r\nbeginner. A piece about nine inches square will do for our set of small\r\nantlers. Lay this on the plaster and turning it over the edge of the\r\nblock, tack it on the back with carpet tacks, beginning in the center,\r\nat top and bottom. Slit in each side to the antler and cut a hole large\r\nenough to be a snug fit for the antler below the burr. Draw on and tack,\r\ngetting the wrinkles out as you proceed, the lower, or front part,\r\nfirst. Lap the upper or back over it neatly at each side, turning the\r\nedges under and fastening them with a few stitches.\r\n\r\nIt is a good plan to drive the tacks only part way at first, then they\r\ncan be easily drawn and re-arranged. Now cut two strips of the material\r\nto go around below the burr of the antlers. Turn the edges of these\r\nunder, draw them tightly around and fasten the ends together back of the\r\nantlers with a few stitches.\r\n\r\nThey are now ready for fastening on a shield or panel. Cattle horns\r\nshould have the piece of bone connecting them screwed to a long oval\r\nblock, then treated similarly. Horns of sheep, cattle and goats\r\nfrequently come loose from the bony core. A little plaster mixed very\r\nthin and poured inside the horn just before replacing them will fasten\r\nthem on again.\r\n\r\nDo not try to polish, paint, gild or otherwise improve the natural\r\nappearance of deer antlers. Wash and clean them well and rub in a little\r\nlinseed oil. Polishing brings out the beauty of horns of cattle and\r\nbison, if the operator is lavish of elbow grease.\r\n\r\nThe process is this: Fasten the horns firmly somewhere and attack first\r\nwith rasp, then file, scrape with glass, fine sandpaper, finer\r\nsandpaper, powdered pumice stone, putty powder. Finish with oiled rag.\r\nOld bison horn, weathered on the prairies till they resemble old roots,\r\ncan be made to look like polished ebony by the above formula. Don't\r\nforget to add the elbow grease, though.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOLTING \"SHED\" ANTLERS TO 2 × 4 BLOCK.]\r\n\r\nShed antlers are a different and rather difficult proposition. It is a\r\ntedious job to drill them and insert heavy irons in their bases so\r\nfirmly as to prevent turning. Often they are cut off at a bevel, drilled\r\nand screwed directly to the shield with brass round headed screws.\r\n\r\nBy drilling into the base of a shed antler, above the burr, in a\r\ndiagonal direction it may be bolted to a short piece of 2×4 scantling.\r\nFasten both antlers on this in a natural position in relation to each\r\nother, then drill a second hole in each and bolt them fast, using\r\nmachine bolts and countersinking the heads in the antlers by chiseling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHED ELK ANTLERS TO BE MOUNTED. From National Zoological\r\nPark Washington, D. C.]\r\n\r\nThe piece of scantling will need to be carved a little in order to get a\r\ngood bearing for the butt of the antlers. This artificial forehead, as\r\nwe might call it, is to be fastened to a heart-shaped block by nailing\r\nor screwing from the back and covered as directed before.\r\n\r\nIf the countersunk bolt heads are carefully modelled over with putty or\r\n\"mache\" and colored like the antlers no one will know they are not\r\nattached to a 'bony' fide forehead.\r\n\r\nElk antlers will need 5/16 inch bolts, while 1/4 inch is sufficient for\r\nmost deer antlers; indeed screws of that diameter will hold a small pair\r\nquite securely.\r\n\r\nSometimes the upper part of the skull is scraped, bleached and fastened\r\nentire to the shield with brass screws or bolts.\r\n\r\nThe base block for large deer antlers should be thicker and larger in\r\nproportion. Elk and moose antlers requiring to be fastened with heavy\r\ncoach or lag-screws to a block cut from two-inch plank.\r\n\r\nAfrica has a profusion of horned game mostly of the antelope family and\r\nof late years many of these horns find their way to the walls in this\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThey are mounted as directed for the deer with the exception that many\r\nof them are improved by polishing the tips or even nearly the entire\r\nlength of the horns. As most of them are corrugated or twisted in great\r\nvariety this calls for considerable preliminary work with half round and\r\nround rasps and files before sandpaper, glass and polishing powders give\r\na finish. If the tips and the higher surfaces of the balance are\r\ncompletely polished, the rest smoothed down somewhat and the entire\r\nhorns rubbed with a little oil the effect will be good.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Good Shield Pattern]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Back of block]\r\n\r\nShields are made in various patterns, woods and sizes, the average pair\r\nof deer antlers requiring one 7/8 inch thick and about 8×10 or 10×12\r\ninches. Oak in a dull oil finish always looks well, though walnut,\r\ncherry, ash and birch are much used. If near a woodworking shop provided\r\nwith a jigsaw and moulder they will turn them out in any pattern you\r\nmay wish. The Ogee moulded edge is to be preferred.\r\n\r\nIf you have to make it yourself, a simple diamond, square or oval panel\r\nwith rounded or beveled edge will be sufficiently difficult.\r\n\r\nArrange the antlers in place on the shield and mark lightly around the\r\nbase, remove them and drill three holes for screws. Countersink for the\r\nheads on the back of the shield and so fasten the antlers in place. For\r\nlight horns a brass screw-eye at the top of shield is used to hang them,\r\nbut heavy moose and elk antlers require an iron plate in back of shield,\r\nlet in flush across the top of a perpendicular groove to catch a hook or\r\nhead of a heavy nail in the wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEER ANTLERS; ELK FEET; BISON HORNS.]\r\n\r\nIf the antlers are to be used as a rack for hats, guns or rods, two\r\nscrew-eyes or plates will be necessary to prevent turning.\r\n\r\nThere are other methods of mounting horns and antlers, but I have found\r\nthe above to be the most substantial and neat, and not very difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nMOUNTING FEET AND HOOFS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany sportsmen now preserve the feet of their large game to have them\r\nmade up in various articles of use and ornament which they can\r\ndistribute among their friends or use in their own homes. Some of these\r\narticles are gun and rod racks, furniture legs and feet, ink wells,\r\nmatch, cigar and ash holders, thermometers, paper weights, umbrella and\r\ncane handles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WOODEN CROOK FOR DEER FOOT.]\r\n\r\nIt goes without saying that for such things as racks, furniture legs,\r\nhandles and thermometer mounts the leg skin attached to the hoof should\r\nbe left six or more inches in length while for ink wells, etc., it may\r\nbe shorter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKINNED DEER FOOT.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEER FOOT INK WELL.]\r\n\r\nIn fairly cool weather the feet and lower legs of deer will keep for\r\nsome days without skinning as they contain but a small amount of flesh.\r\nStill it is safest and but the work of a few minutes to split them up\r\nthe backs, skin down to the toe joints and cut them off there. Dry them\r\nwith or without salting and they are easily packed up to carry home or\r\nsend to the taxidermist. If one foot and shank is received in the flesh\r\nit will aid in mounting them up as racks, furniture legs, etc., as for\r\nsuch purposes the skin is mounted over a piece of wood of the size and\r\nshape of the skinned leg. For preparing feet for racks and handles it is\r\nwell to supply yourself with a number of natural crooks of about the\r\nsize of a deer's leg and nearly of a right angle. Sassafras, gum or some\r\nsoft wood work up easiest. When skinned place in pickle or give foot\r\ncoating of arsenic and alum--pickle is best. Be sure and leave enough\r\nskin attached to hoof; a little experience will teach you this. Now\r\nremove foot from bath, rinse well and sew up same as far as the claws;\r\nnext bore a hole through the claws from inside of claws, where it will\r\nnot show. Get two wire nails and nail these claws to a board, as shown\r\nin A. Now arrange the hoofs as shown in illustration and put a screw\r\ninto each from underneath, to hold them down (B), or you can nail a\r\ncleat across them by nailing to the block on each side of hoof; the idea\r\nis to get these parts firmly placed in position. Now finish sewing up\r\nthe skin and stuff it full of chopped excelsior, shaping the foot as you\r\nproceed. Now drive a long nail against back side of foot to keep it from\r\nsagging (C). Allow the foot to thoroughly dry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEER FOOT THERMOMETER.]\r\n\r\nWhen dry remove excelsior and cut off surplus skin around top and the\r\nfoot is ready for an ink well, match safe, ash tray or paper weight, as\r\nthey all go on the same way. Mix up some plaster of paris in water and\r\nrun the foot full and place the ink well or other fitting in place and\r\nallow the plaster to \"set\" and the foot is finished. If you wish a pen\r\nrest you can now place it in position. In setting up thermometers remove\r\nbone to hoof and whittle out a stick shape of bones removed. Coat inside\r\nof skin with arsenic and alum and place stick in position and sew up\r\nskin. Put on metal cap at top and tack on thermometer. For hooks on\r\nracks, work up a stick with crook into the approximate size and shape of\r\nthe deer's leg with the foot bent at right angles. It had best be a\r\nlittle small so it can have a coating of clay or other modelling\r\nmaterial to make the skin fit it perfectly. Sew up as for thermometer.\r\nWhen dry fasten to the rack by inserting in a square or oval hole and\r\nwedging at the back.\r\n\r\nFor furniture legs the feet are turned out in natural position on wooden\r\nlegs, and fastened by bolting or screwing to small tables, stools, or\r\nscreens. As handles for canes and umbrellas, treat the same as for hooks\r\nand leave the wood long to form a dowel which is glued or inserted in\r\ncane or umbrella, a metal band covering the end of the skin. I have\r\nreferred in this chapter to deer feet, but those of elk, caribou and\r\nmoose are also used and suitable fittings in nickel and silver plate are\r\nsupplied in various sizes by dealers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEER FOOT HAT RACK.]\r\n\r\nIf you wish the hoofs mottled (they look best that way) file same until\r\nyou get to the \"quick,\" which is light in color and gives the foot a\r\nvery attractive appearance. Smooth down with sandpaper or edge of glass.\r\nOil a rag and dip it in powdered pumice stone and rub hoof vigorously a\r\nfew moments, and you will have a beautiful polish.\r\n\r\nThe smaller articles are complete as they are or may be mounted, ink\r\nwells, etc., on round, and thermometers on long panels of variously\r\nfinished woods. Many nice articles may thus be made from what is usually\r\nconsidered worthless offal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOOSE FOOT JEWEL CASE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nMOUNTING FISH.\r\n\r\n\r\nThese with reptiles are most difficult to preserve with any success by\r\nthe ordinary methods. There are some individuals which it is impossible\r\nfor the taxidermist to prepare the skins of, so as to retain a natural\r\nappearance for any length of time. They can only be represented by casts\r\npainted to the best of the artist's ability.\r\n\r\nMost of the varieties of medium and large game fishes can be mounted by\r\nthe average taxidermist and it is with these we are mostly concerned.\r\nThere are almost as many methods of mounting fish as there are\r\noperators, each having some pet kink of real or fancied superiority.\r\n\r\nAs often as otherwise fish are mounted in the medallion style, with one\r\nside only showing. This is especially adapted to display on walls and\r\npanels. For filling material everything from sawdust to plaster has been\r\nemployed but as good results as any are secured by a hard core of the\r\napproximate size of the skinned fish, coated with some plastic\r\nsubstances which is moulded into shape through the skin.\r\n\r\nIn skinning some fish the scales must be protected by pasting thin paper\r\nover them but ordinarily it is sufficient to keep the skin wet and not\r\nallow it to dry out until it is complete. A piece of oil cloth is good\r\nto work on in skinning fish or birds either. Some taxidermists have a\r\nlarge pane of glass set flush in a table top for this purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FISH BEDDED IN SAND WITH PLASTER MOULD OF UPPER HALF.]\r\n\r\nWith a freshly caught fish at hand which is to be made into a medallion\r\nthe process is about as follows: Before skinning lay it flat on one side\r\non a piece of soft wood board of the proper thickness and mark out its\r\noutline. Though only one side of the mounted fish shows, a little more\r\nthan precisely one half is preserved in order to include the tail, the\r\nvertical and dorsal fins and also to give an appearance of rotundity.\r\n\r\nLeaving this margin all around, the skin is cut away from the side\r\nwhich, on account of damage or other reason, is selected for the back.\r\nThe head must be cut through with chisel or a fine saw. Severing the\r\nbones at the base of the fins with the scissors the whole body is\r\nremoved by cutting the spinal column at its junction with the skull.\r\n\r\nIn skinning fish you will note a white layer, like tin foil, which gives\r\nthe fish its silvery color. Do not disturb this if possible. Remove all\r\nsurplus flesh, cut away the gills and interior of head and if at all\r\ngreasy (what fish is not) treat to a bath in gasoline. Use absorbent,\r\nsawdust or meal to remove oily gasoline, drop in alcohol or formaldehyde\r\nsolution while the body is prepared. To do this cut out the board by the\r\noutline on it with a short bevel on the back and the other side the full\r\nshape of the fish. The whole form is slightly diminished, however, to\r\nallow for a coating of clay. This is applied after the skin has been\r\nremoved from the solution and poisoned.\r\n\r\nWhen a good fit is secured the skin is fastened in place by sewing from\r\ntop to bottom, across the back board, or if large, nailing the edges to\r\nthe board. The fins which have been kept wet are to be spread; each\r\nclamped with two pieces of pasteboard. On very large fish spring clothes\r\npins may be used to clamp the fins, for small ones pins forced through\r\nboth thicknesses, _outside_ the fins.\r\n\r\nSponge the fish off carefully to remove all clay or other dirt and give\r\nit a coat of rather thin white varnish. This prevents the scales curling\r\nup and to some extent fixes or restores the colors of the fish.\r\n\r\nThe eye is set after the fish is dry and if it does not fill the socket,\r\nmodel around it with wax or paper pulp. Fish eyes vary so greatly that\r\nto strictly copy nature you had better use the uncolored fish eyes,\r\npainting the back with suitable oil colors with a coat or two of shellac\r\nover it to prevent the clay in which it is set from affecting the paint.\r\nThe final painting of a mounted fish which is necessary to complete the\r\nbest work is a task for an artist. If a specimen in the flesh (living if\r\npossible) is at hand this is made easier. All fish skins collected\r\nshould be accompanied by color sketches if possible.\r\n\r\nAll silvery fish should be coated with size and nickel leaf over their\r\nentire scaly surface. On this ground paint with thin oil colors. If the\r\npaint is not too thick the desired silvery sheen will show through. If\r\nthe whole fish is dark no leaf is needed and in some cases the upper\r\npart of the body requires a gold ground with the nickel leaf on the\r\nsilvery under parts. Japanese gold paint or something similar will do\r\nfor a golden ground.\r\n\r\nThe finished medallion may lie flat in a case, be fastened on the face\r\nof a panel, or hung by a loop at the mouth or center of back. Panels of\r\nnatural wood are a favorite mount and framed panels covered with plush\r\nor the imitation pebbled upholstery leather.\r\n\r\nAnother method of mounting medallions is to take a plaster mold of the\r\ndisplay half of the fish and from it make a plaster cast like the back\r\nboard. This is sandpapered down to allow for the skin and gouged out at\r\nthe bases of the fins and tail. The head too is not reproduced on the\r\ncast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEDALLION FISH, PAPER BACKING, BOARD BACK, EXCELSIOR\r\nBETWEEN.]\r\n\r\nWhen the skin is ready to apply, coat this plaster cast with some\r\nnonporous modelling material. A mixture of thin liquid glue and whiting\r\nis good for this. Some paper pulp is put inside the head and at the\r\njunction of body and fins. Shape from the outside with the fingers.\r\n\r\nA piece of wood should have been placed in the back of the plaster cast\r\nwhen making same, in order to fasten to a panel by screws from the back.\r\nPaint the wood with melted paraffin before putting in the wet plaster or\r\nit may swell and subsequently shrink enough to crack the cast. By either\r\nof the preceding methods the entire fish can be mounted if desired.\r\n\r\nThe opening cut should be made from head to tail along the lower edge of\r\nthe body in most scale fish and will require some neat modelling to hide\r\nas both sides are to be on exhibition.\r\n\r\nEntire fish are usually supported by metal standards rising from a\r\nwooden base. Such standards are preferably of brass, threaded and fitted\r\nwith nuts and rosettes at both ends. Two nuts at the lower end clamp the\r\nbase and with the upper end inserted in the back board, the upper nut\r\nwill adjust the fish at the right heighth. The rosettes cover the nuts\r\nand add a finished appearance.\r\n\r\nEspecially adapted to tarpon and other ponderous fish are medallions\r\nmounted on paper. To do this a half mould is made as described, the skin\r\nremoved, cleaned, poisoned and replaced in the mould. Then it is backed\r\nup with numerous layers of soft paper, well pasted and pressed in with\r\nthe hands. Let these layers of paper overlap the mould at least as much\r\nas the margin of skin left on the back.\r\n\r\nWhen a sufficient thickness is attained fill the hollow form loosely\r\nwith crumpled paper or excelsior and fit in place a back board of light\r\nwood. Nail through the margin of skin and paper into the edges of this.\r\nIf a number of large holes were made in the back board it will expedite\r\nthe drying out.\r\n\r\nWhen partly dry, remove from the mould, painting and finishing as before\r\nwhen completely dry. By this means the contour of large fish is\r\nabsolutely reproduced and the finished work is extremely light and\r\ndurable.\r\n\r\nMany of the smooth skinned fishes are impossible to mount\r\nsatisfactorily, a cast is the best we can do for them.\r\n\r\nWhen using a living fish as a guide in painting, it may be confined in\r\nan aquarium and by sliding a wire screen partition, be kept just before\r\nthe artist's eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nMOUNTING FISH--BAUMGARTEL METHOD.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome years ago A Practical Method of Fish Mounting was advertised by Mr.\r\nBaumgartel in Angling and Sporting publications. Entire satisfaction was\r\ngiven to those who studied and applied the lessons, through\r\ncorrespondence school methods. Both the author and publisher of HOME\r\nTAXIDERMY FOR PLEASURE AND PROFIT, are indeed glad to publish the entire\r\ncourse as used by Mr. Baumgartel, including diagrams, figures, etc., as\r\nsame together with copyright was conveyed to A. R. Harding.\r\n\r\nThe same degree of excellence in mounting fish has not been so generally\r\nattained as in other branches of the taxidermy art, and this I believe\r\nis because an equal amount of study has not been given the subject.\r\nHundreds can mount birds well to one who can prepare fish in as skillful\r\na manner, although the mounting of fish dates from as early a period in\r\nthe art of taxidermy. It is a question of method and the right one.\r\n\r\nThe usual methods of mounting fish have proven so unsatisfactory that\r\nthey have been almost entirely abandoned, and, until the method to be\r\ndescribed was devised, it was necessary to place specimens in alcohol or\r\nother preserving liquids or to make plaster casts of them. The\r\nobjections to the former process are that it is expensive, requiring\r\nespecially constructed jars to show the specimens without distortion.\r\nThey usually lose all their natural colors, and in most cases shrink to\r\nsuch an extent as to give only an approximate idea of their original\r\nform. There are also serious objections to the latter method. Plaster\r\ncasts are easily broken and certain parts, such as the interior of the\r\nmouth, cannot readily be produced. Further, it is not desirable in\r\nnatural history collections to exhibit casts of the objects when the\r\noriginals can be displayed. Then, too, the sportsman does not care for a\r\ncast of his \"Big Fish,\" but wants the real thing to verify history of\r\nthe one that didn't get away. To me a plaster cast of an object that can\r\nitself be preserved is about as interesting as a nicely painted decoy\r\nduck compares with a well-mounted skin.\r\n\r\nAs is the case with nearly every taxidermist, professional as well as\r\namateur, I have always been an enthusiastic sportsman. The desire to\r\npreserve the specimens taken by me led me to devote myself to the study\r\nof taxidermy. Perhaps the dilatoriness of the \"artist\" who mounted my\r\nfirst specimens had a stimulating effect. Later, as a professional\r\ntaxidermist, I for many years mounted fish by means of the various\r\nmethods, but the results obtained were not satisfactory to me.\r\n\r\nIn 1903 Mrs. Baumgartel and I made a trip to Pine River, Michigan, for\r\ntrout. It was in June. The weather turned cold, and we took few fish. On\r\nthe twelfth I made what was to be my last cast, had taken down my rod\r\nand was walking along the bank of the river on my way to camp, when at\r\nthe edge of a pool I noticed a fish jumping. I could not resist the\r\ntemptation to try one more cast, and making preparations I dropped a\r\nParmachene Belle a few inches from the spot where the fish had just\r\nbroken the water. There was a rise, a strike, and I was fast to a fish\r\ndestined to be mine. After an exciting struggle, I landed a\r\nthirteen-inch grayling weighing one pound and two ounces. Of course,\r\nthis fish I had to preserve and wanted it to look as it did when taken\r\nfrom the net. We boarded the train for home that evening, and supplying\r\nmy wife with reading matter, I was soon lost in meditation. The madam\r\ntold me many times during the journey home that I was not at all\r\ncompanionable. Be that as it may, the result of the earnest study given\r\nthe matter, and the previous experience gained in experimenting with\r\nother processes, was that a practical method of mounting fish was\r\ndevised, a method by means of which the angler can successfully mount\r\nhis own specimens. \"Necessity is the mother of invention,\" you know.\r\n\r\nA picture of this grayling is given below. It still occupies a position\r\nin our dining room, together with others to remind us of pleasant days\r\non lake and stream. It is mounted with the very fly and leader on which\r\nit was taken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GRAYLING--RESULT OF MY FIRST EXPERIENCE AT FISH\r\nMOUNTING.]\r\n\r\nFor the past four years I have successfully taught my method by\r\ncorrespondence. A few years ago activities in other directions compelled\r\nme to give up taxidermy work, and other interests now demanding more of\r\nmy personal attention, the publisher of this book, always on the alert\r\nfor something of practical value to interest his readers, will present\r\nto you in these pages the identical instructions I have so successfully\r\nused. I take the liberty of quoting verbatim from a letter just received\r\nby me from a friend of a prominent eastern professional man, one who,\r\nwhile \"chained to business,\" still finds time to get \"close to nature\"\r\nfor a season each year:\r\n\r\n\"Referring to the fish mounted on our Newfoundland trip: I may say that\r\nit was our first experience and we were agreeably surprised at results.\r\nIn all there were ten specimens of salmon, sea-trout and brook-trout\r\nmounted and we found no great difficulties. All the work was\r\naccomplished in an old barn after we got home evenings and early\r\nmornings before going out. The only obstacle we encountered was getting\r\nthe fish back to the states in good shape. Five of the specimens now\r\noccupy prominent place in the Doctor's den and I am always pleased to\r\npoint out to friends the results of our labors.\"\r\n\r\nYou can do as well.\r\n\r\nINSTRUMENTS.\r\n\r\n    Knife.\r\n    Needle and thread.\r\n    Saw, fine toothed.\r\n    Scalpel.\r\n    Scissors, straight and curved.\r\n    Shears.\r\n    Skin scraper, not the toothed-edge.\r\n    Tweezers.\r\n\r\nOne can get along with simply a jack-knife, pair of shears, and needle\r\nand thread; but to do first-class work easily, good tools are required.\r\n\r\nMATERIALS.\r\n\r\n    Alcohol.\r\n    Aluminum leaf.\r\n    Arsenic, powdered.\r\n    Clay, potters' or modelling.\r\n    Eyes, glass, clear except pupils.\r\n    Papier mache, prepared.\r\n    Pine board.\r\n    Pins.\r\n    Plaster, calcined.\r\n    Tube paints.\r\n    Varnish, clear white.\r\n    Brushes.\r\n\r\nPRELIMINARY INSTRUCTIONS--Try first a perch or other fish having scales\r\nfirmly attached. See that the fins and tail are uninjured, and that no\r\nscales are missing from the side to be displayed. As every perfectly\r\nformed fish has both sides alike, and as ordinarily but one side can be\r\nseen at a time, only a little more than one half of the fish is to be\r\nmounted.\r\n\r\nNote carefully the colors (including those of the eye and the interior\r\nof the mouth) of the freshly caught fish, making a sketch of the\r\nspecimen, showing the extent of the different colors and markings, the\r\nspots, if any, and the eye. The pupil is not usually round. The eye of a\r\nlake trout appears like Fig. 1. A carefully kept note book is a valuable\r\naid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1 Eye of Lake Trout]\r\n\r\nWhile the tail is of course a fin (the caudal), in this work it will be\r\ncalled the \"tail,\" to distinguish it from the other fins. See Fig. 2 for\r\nkey to the names of the fins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FISH IN MOULD. (Fig. 2.)\r\n\r\nNames of fins: D--Dorsal, A--Adipose, C--Caudal (tail), P--Pectoral,\r\nV--Ventral, An--Anal.]\r\n\r\nTHE MOLD.--Wash the fish in water to remove dirt and mucus. On a board\r\nsomewhat longer and wider than the fish, place a sufficient amount of\r\nmoist sand in which to imbed the specimen to one-half its depth when\r\nlying on its side in the desired position. Level the sand and hollow it\r\nout for the larger part of the body. Large fish should be displayed\r\nstraight, with the mouth closed or only slightly open. Smaller and more\r\ngraceful ones may be shown in positions of activity; rising to fly,\r\nbreaking away, etc. If the mouth is to be open, fill it with cotton or\r\ncloth in order to keep out the plaster. Place the fish in the position\r\nyou wish it to have when mounted, the side to be displayed uppermost.\r\nSee that the dorsal and anal fins, and the tail, lie flat on the sand,\r\nand that one-half the body appears above the sand its entire length.\r\nThere must be no uneven places. Viewed from the end, it should appear\r\nlike Fig. 3; from the side, like Fig. 4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: END VIEW. (Fig. 3)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIDE VIEW. (Fig. 4)]\r\n\r\nHeap up the sand all around, about an inch from the fish, to prevent the\r\nplaster flowing off the board.\r\n\r\nMix a sufficient amount of plaster to cover the fish to a depth of about\r\nhalf an inch, covering the fins and tail as well as the body. Mix the\r\nplaster by stirring a little at a time into cold water until it has the\r\nconsistency of cream. Place the pectoral and ventral fins flat against\r\nthe body. Pour the plaster over the fish slowly and evenly (covering the\r\nhead, tail and edges first), allowing it time to dry until quite hard,\r\nperhaps thirty to forty minutes. Then turn the mold over (it will appear\r\nlike Fig. 2) and, by inserting the fingers in the gills, carefully\r\nremove the fish. Lay the mold aside for a time. Wash all sand and\r\nplaster from the fish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INCISIONS TO BE MADE. (Fig. 5)]\r\n\r\nSKINNING THE FISH.--If the fish has scales easily dislodged, wrap it,\r\nwith the exception of the fins and tail, in several thicknesses of\r\ntissue paper, which will readily adhere to the moist skin. Lay the fish\r\non your table, on the side which was covered by the plaster and place\r\nwet cloths on the fins and tail to prevent drying. Commence at the gills\r\nand make two cuts with the scissors or scalpel lengthwise of the fish to\r\nthe tail, cutting into the abdominal cavity below, joining these cuts\r\n(see Fig. 5), removing the strip of skin, including the pectoral fin,\r\nwith adhering flesh, and the contents of the cavity.\r\n\r\nWith the fingers, or tweezers, grasp the cut edge of the skin of the\r\nback and with the scalpel carefully separate it from the flesh as far as\r\nthe middle line of the back from the head to the tail. Remove the\r\nexposed flesh to the backbone. With the knife, shears or fine tooth saw,\r\nsplit the head lengthwise a little to one side of the middle, leaving\r\nsomewhat more than half. Do not sever the skin of the body where it\r\ncomes to a point between the gills, and use great care when removing the\r\nflesh from this portion.\r\n\r\nYou now have a trifle more than one-half the fish to work on. With the\r\nscissors cut through the ribs and remove the backbone with some of the\r\nflesh. Be careful when cutting through the backbone at the tail not to\r\ncut through the skin below. Going back to the head, remove the remaining\r\nflesh, and with the curved scissors and scalpel cut away all the\r\ncartilage possible from the head; the more the better so long as the\r\nskin is not injured. If enough of the cartilage can be removed to expose\r\nthe muscles of the cheek from the inside, cut them away, taking out the\r\neye; otherwise it will be necessary to work from the outside of the skin\r\nthrough the eye opening, and this must be done very carefully or the\r\nskin of the cheek may be broken. With most fishes it is possible to\r\nremove all the cartilage from the head, and this should be done to\r\nprevent shrinkage. If the mouth is to be open, do not cut away its\r\nlining or much of the tongue behind. The tongue is to be split\r\nperpendicularly lengthwise and about one-third of it removed. When the\r\nhead has been thoroughly cleaned, remove the remaining flesh from the\r\nbody with the skin scraper or scalpel.\r\n\r\nThe ventral fin which is uppermost as the fish lies on its side and is\r\nnot to show, should be carefully cut off outside the skin. Do not cut\r\noff the ventral fin on the side which is to be displayed. Do not scrape\r\naway the silvery lining of the skin if this can be avoided. Some of it\r\nwill come off. Cut away the bases of all the fins and the tail inside\r\nwith the curved scissors and scrape away all flesh, working close to the\r\nfingers so as not to stretch the skin. Tie the vent inside with thread.\r\nUnless the fish is quite small, the skin of the lower jaw must be\r\nloosened with the knife or scalpel and the muscles cut away. The\r\nadipose, or small fleshy fin on the back near the tail of such fishes as\r\nthe trout, must be carefully opened from the inside of the skin with a\r\nsmall-bladed knife and the contents removed, to be later replaced with\r\nclay.\r\n\r\nPlace the skin in water to loosen the paper--if any has been\r\nused--carefully washing the skin and wetting the fins and tail\r\nthoroughly. You may allow the skin to remain in the water until you are\r\nready to put it back in the mold, but not longer than a few hours.\r\n\r\nFILLING.--Brush the sand from the mold, and if the upper edge is uneven,\r\nsmooth it with a knife so that it will be perfectly straight. Should\r\nthere be any rough places on the inside of the mold, carefully scrape\r\nthem down with the skin scraper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INSIDE BOARD. (Fig. 6)]\r\n\r\nCut out roughly a piece of soft pine one-half to one inch thick the\r\nshape of the outline of the fish, but somewhat smaller, using the mold\r\nas a guide. One side will, of course, be flat, and that side should be\r\nuppermost when placed in the mold. Work up with water a sufficient\r\nquantity of clay to about the consistency of fresh putty. Place the mold\r\non your bench or table, resting it on something soft (such as a piece of\r\nold carpet or burlap) to prevent its breaking. Drain the water from the\r\nskin and put it back into the mold, adjusting it nicely. The median line\r\nwill guide you. See that the head, fins and tail occupy the same places\r\nthey did before. Pour a little alcohol on the skin inside and let it run\r\nalong the bases of the fins and tail, over the entire inner surface of\r\nthe skin and into the head to preserve any bits of flesh that may\r\npossibly remain. Drain off the surplus alcohol. Fill the adipose fin (if\r\nthe fish has one) with clay. Sprinkle powdered arsenic over the entire\r\ninside of the skin and head. Do not use more than will readily adhere.\r\n\r\nThe chances are that you removed more or less of the silvery lining of\r\nthe skin. Whether you did or not, cover the entire inner surface of the\r\nskin of the cheek and body with two or three thicknesses of aluminum\r\nleaf. Do not cover the entire surface at once. Cover a small part at a\r\ntime, and then put on top of the leaf enough clay to cover it,\r\ncommencing at the head and continuing to the tail. Replace the muscles\r\nand cartilage of the head with clay. Be sure to keep the skin properly\r\nadjusted to the mold. See that the fins and the tail remain in their\r\nproper places and that they are kept covered with wet cloths.\r\n\r\nFlatten out the clay (a small quantity at a time) with the fingers and\r\ncover the inside of the skin to the depth of about one-eighth of an\r\ninch, pressing it down firmly, especially at the bases of the fins and\r\ntail and into the cheek and head. Fit in the piece of pine, cutting it\r\ndown as may be necessary. Its shape will be something like Fig. 6.\r\n\r\nMix some more plaster, and before putting in the piece of board, pour in\r\nthe plaster on the clay, filling the skin perhaps two-thirds full.\r\nQuickly, before the plaster sets, put in the piece of wood, carefully\r\npressing it down into the plaster until it is level with the upper edge\r\nof the mold, removing any surplus plaster quickly and neatly. Sew up the\r\nskin from one edge to the other as shown in Fig. 7.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SEWING UP THE SKIN. (Fig. 7)]\r\n\r\nREMOVING SPECIMEN FROM MOLD AND DRYING.--Lay a piece of clean board of\r\nthe proper size on top of the mold, turning both over. Lift up the mold\r\na trifle, gently shaking it. The fish may or may not come out. If not,\r\nturn the mold back, insert the point of a knife in the wood and try to\r\nstart the fish. In extreme cases it may be necessary to break the mold\r\ncarefully. However, there should be no undercuts to hold the fish.\r\n\r\nCarefully wash the fish as it lays on the board to remove all clay and\r\nplaster which may be on the upper surface. With the fingers smooth out\r\nany wrinkles or uneven places. Sometimes, when drying, small wrinkles or\r\nbubbles may appear in the skin of such fish as trout, but they will soon\r\ndisappear. If you placed the fish in a natural position when making the\r\nmold and properly adjusted the cleaned skin to the mold, there should be\r\nno wrinkles.\r\n\r\nPlace thin pieces of wood the shape of the fins between the board and\r\nthe dorsal and anal fins, which should stand out from the board a little\r\nway. Cover the tail and the fins which lie flat with thin pieces of\r\nwood, pinning them to the board until dry. The fins which do not lie\r\nflat should be spread between thin pieces of wood held in place with\r\npins or clips.\r\n\r\nWhen the surface of the fish is dry, which will be in from six to twelve\r\nhours, give it a coat of the very best white varnish (the ordinary\r\nyellow varnish will not do) and put the specimen in a well ventilated\r\nplace out of the sun to dry. In three or four days when the fins are\r\ndry, remove the thin pieces of wood and apply another coat of varnish.\r\n\r\nCAUTION.--Arsenic is poison and should be kept out of the way of\r\nchildren and animals. Keep the box covered when not in use.\r\n\r\nCuts in the hand can be protected by covering them with liquid court\r\nplaster. Clean the finger nails carefully when through work, washing the\r\nhands in warm water containing a few drops of carbolic acid.\r\n\r\nFINISHING.--While the fish is drying secure uncolored glass eyes with\r\nthe properly shaped black pupils and paint the iris from your sketch.\r\nWhen the specimen is thoroughly dry, in two or three weeks, dig a\r\nsufficient amount of clay out of the eye opening and put in the glass\r\neye, setting it in papier mache. Use the prepared mache, which only\r\nrequires boiling with water for preparation. When the mache is dry, give\r\nthe exposed portion of it one or two coats of paint of the proper color.\r\n\r\nNow do such painting as may be necessary--for instance, the spots and\r\nfins of the brook trout, colors of which have doubtless vanished by this\r\ntime. Use tube paint, thinned with the white varnish. Usually it is\r\nsufficient to place a small quantity of the paint of the proper color\r\ndirectly into the varnish. Do not use much of the paint--just enough to\r\nsecure the color and yet not obscure the scales. Where the markings are\r\nprominent, put some of the paint directly on the fish and spread it with\r\nthe varnish. Brilliant spots, such as those of the trout, can be\r\nreproduced by the use of the paints without the varnish.\r\n\r\nWhile the specimen is drying prepare a panel for it. To show the fish to\r\nthe best advantage, the panel should be of polished hardwood, although\r\nstained pine will answer. Bore two holes about half way through the\r\npanel from the back, slanting upward, by which to hang it. (See Fig. 8.)\r\nBore two holes entirely through the panel in the proper places and screw\r\nthe fish to it, putting in the screws from the back of the panel and\r\ninto the fish where the wood is thickest. Countersink the screws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOME MADE PANEL. (Fig. 8)]\r\n\r\nFinally, apply a last coat of the varnish. Do not varnish the glass eye.\r\nBy keeping a piece of writing paper between the panel and your brush you\r\ncan varnish the fish without getting any on the panel. It is best to put\r\non the final coat after the specimen is mounted on the panel, because if\r\nthe fish is handled before the varnish is hard finger marks will show.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIDE VIEW. (Fig. 9)]\r\n\r\nMOUNTING HEADS.--With a sharp knife or saw cut the head off squarely\r\njust back of first (pectoral) fins, as shown in Figs. 9 and 10, which\r\nshow the head of a black bass. In this case the ventral fins are also\r\nleft on. Place the head on a board with the cut part down, spreading the\r\nfins as in Fig. 10. If it is to be displayed with open mouth, fill the\r\nmouth with cotton or cloth to exclude the plaster. Cover the whole head\r\nwith plaster.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRONT VIEW. (Fig. 10)]\r\n\r\nAfter the plaster sets, with a saw and knife cut the mold into two parts\r\nlengthwise, being careful not to cut into the head. Use the saw first\r\nand when the plaster is cut down close to the skin use the knife\r\ncarefully. Do not attempt to remove the head before cutting the mold in\r\ntwo.\r\n\r\nRemove flesh and cartilage from the head, line with aluminum leaf, and\r\nproceed as previously instructed. Of course none of the tongue is to be\r\nremoved if the mouth is to be left open, in which case do not remove the\r\nbony parts of the gills. Before placing the cleaned skin in the mold,\r\ntie the two parts of the mold together. Cut a neck board to fit and set\r\nit in plaster. Finish as previously advised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nMOUNTING REPTILES, FROGS AND TOADS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe largest reptile of the United States, the alligator, is mounted by\r\nmethods applied to medium sized animals. Leg, head and tail rods are\r\nstapled to a stout back board and after building up the legs from tow\r\nthe larger part of the body is filled by stuffing with coarse tow or\r\nfine excelsior. Let the skin rest back down while engaged in this,\r\nsewing up the skin as it proceeds, with stout twine and a sail needle.\r\nYou may even need to use the awl to pierce the armor like skin.\r\n\r\nFor any natural position the leg irons need not be heavy as this animal\r\nusually keeps its body and tail in contact with the ground. The leg rods\r\nare clinched or bolted beneath the pedestal as in other quadrupeds and\r\nin addition some long screws are turned into the back board from below\r\nand the tail held down by wire fastened to its central support and\r\nclinched beneath the pedestal.\r\n\r\nAll but the smallest lizards are mounted in the same way as the small\r\nfur-bearers. There is apparently no known mode of \"stuffing\" a snake so\r\nas to resemble its natural state.\r\n\r\nThe skin must be placed on a carefully modelled manikin with a plastic\r\nlayer between. For small snakes tow is wound on a wire and shaped with\r\nthread, and excelsior is used in the same way for the large ones.\r\n\r\nThe larger manikins are to be posed and paper coated in most cases\r\nbefore receiving the skin. Frogs and toads are also very difficult to\r\nmount in natural positions, but are nicely represented in painted casts.\r\n\r\nFrogs, however, possess the distinction of not having to be sewed up,\r\nwhen skinned as they usually are through the mouth. In doing this the\r\nentire body is dissected away through the mouth and the legs are\r\ndetached and skinned the same way.\r\n\r\nAfter turning completely wrong side out and poisoning the legs are\r\nwired, wrapped with tow or cotton in the same manner as other small\r\nanimals. One hind leg wire is cut long enough to reach through the body\r\nand head and to this the other leg wires are twisted. Some claim that to\r\nleave the vertebral column attached to the skin of the back is an\r\ninvaluable aid in giving that part its proper shape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WIRING SYSTEM FOR FROG.]\r\n\r\nThe body filling is tow or cotton placed through the mouth in small\r\npieces until the proper shape is acquired. Dry sand has been used to\r\nfill the bodies of frogs, being poured in the mouth through a funnel and\r\nretained by a cotton plug until the skin was dry, when it was poured\r\nout.\r\n\r\nPainting and varnishing are required to finish mounted frogs. The frog\r\nis a favorite with the caricaturist as it can be made to take almost any\r\nhuman posture with laughable results.\r\n\r\nTurtles may be mounted by wrapping and wiring legs, tail and head like\r\nother small animals, after detaching the under shell on three sides,\r\nremoving the body and skinning the limbs. The tow wrapped legs should\r\nhave a covering of soft clay which can be shaped with the fingers after\r\nthey are returned to the skin.\r\n\r\nTwisting the wires together is all right for the small turtles, large\r\nones need a block of wood to clinch the wires in. The under shell is\r\nreplaced and fastened with small wires and as enough skin was left\r\nattached to it to sew to, all cuts are closed that way. Heavy wires are\r\nseldom necessary in turtles. Those having bright colored shells will\r\nneed to be touched up with paint and all should be varnished thinly to\r\ngive a fresh appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nSKULLS AND SKELETONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the preparation of skeletons for the cabinet is sometimes\r\nundertaken by the general taxidermist it is more often the work of a\r\ntrained osteologist. Collectors in the field are often asked to preserve\r\nrough skeletons of desirable varieties and the skulls at least should be\r\npreserved with the skin of each quadruped taken for mounting.\r\n\r\nA specimen with a damaged or imperfect skin may yield a good skeleton\r\nand in the case of something very rare both the skin and skeleton may be\r\nmounted separately. This process is one calling for a skilled operator\r\nas all claws, nails or hoofs should remain on the skin while their bony\r\ncores are part of the skeleton.\r\n\r\nIn the preservation of rough skeletons, skinning by any method is the\r\nfirst step, next the removal of the viscera, etc., then the most of the\r\nflesh and muscle should be dissected off the bones, after which poison\r\nwith dry arsenic and put where it will dry out quickly and be out of the\r\nreach of foraging animals.\r\n\r\nThe legs of small animals should be unjointed as well as the skull and\r\nafter trimming be put inside the body cavity and securely tied to\r\nprevent loss; birds are treated about the same and all large animals are\r\npretty thoroughly taken apart in order to properly clean the bones.\r\n\r\nAlways remember that a skeleton with parts cut away or bones lost is\r\nabout as good as none. Leave any cartilage attachments and any parts of\r\na bony nature for the osteologist, to be on the safe side. Sometimes\r\nalong salt water an uncleaned skeleton may be put in a wire netting cage\r\nand anchored in the water where various small marine animals will soon\r\nclear away the flesh. On land, too, a similar expedient may be practiced\r\nby putting small carcasses in a box with holes bored in it and burying\r\nit in some active ant hill. In both cases the openings need to be small,\r\nthat the smaller bones may not be carried off and they should be removed\r\nbefore the ligaments are destroyed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SKULLS--DOG WOLF, SHE WOLF, BAY LYNX, OTTER, MINK.]\r\n\r\nWhen they are not wanted for scientific purposes, skulls may be cleaned\r\nwith the minimum labor by boiling. Watch them closely, however, and\r\nremove as soon as the flesh gets tender as much cooking will cause the\r\nteeth to fall out and the skull to separate at the sutures. Glue and\r\nplaster paris will put such disintegrated skulls in shape for commercial\r\nmounting but they are ruined forever for the scientist.\r\n\r\nA friend was once cleaning a quantity of skulls (for museum purposes)\r\nand to expedite matters put them on to boil; all went well as long as\r\nthe pot was watched, but an accident, the collapse of a large building,\r\ncalled him away and prevented his return until a dozen or so skulls had\r\nturned to a mass of loose teeth and scraps of bone. I never knew just\r\nwhat transpired between him and the museum curator afterward, nothing of\r\ninterest to the general public.\r\n\r\nSmall specimens which it is proposed to skeletonize are best preserved\r\nentire in alcoholic solution as loss and breakage are thus prevented.\r\nThe solution of formaldehyde can be used for this purpose but is not as\r\ngood as it toughens the flesh, making its future removal more difficult.\r\nThe complete cleaning of a skeleton is a matter of much soaking and\r\nscraping, calling for much patience and a strong stomach. Ligamentary\r\nskeletons of the smaller birds and animals are often prepared and\r\nmounted by the non-professional with fair success.\r\n\r\nThe entire specimen is cleaned of all flesh without disconnecting any of\r\nthe bones except the skull and the leg of all but the smallest species.\r\n\r\nThe spinal cord is replaced with a brass or galvanized wire of suitable\r\nsize and length; this should project enough to penetrate a piece of cork\r\nfitted to the cavity of the skull. If the leg bones were removed they\r\nshould be fastened back in place by drilling small holes through them at\r\nthe joints, inserting a piece of brass wire and clinching the ends over.\r\n\r\nThe skeleton is hung by cords or threads in a frame of wooden strips, so\r\nthe feet will rest on the base, and then arranged in some natural\r\nattitude, holding the parts in place until the ligaments are fully dry\r\nby means of pins, threads and strips of cardboard.\r\n\r\nThe finished skeleton had best be supported on its pedestal by two metal\r\nrods with a U shaped fork at their upper ends which will clasp the\r\nvertebrae just in front of the hind legs and back of the head. These\r\nrods should be of brass or galvanized iron gilded and their lower ends\r\nare either threaded and provided with two nuts, or bent at right angles\r\nand stapled to the under side of the mount. Bird skeletons are treated\r\nin a similar way, but the wing bones need a supporting wire fastened to\r\nthe back bone and a single standard. The smaller birds and animals up to\r\nthe size of a small squirrel may be skeletonized and mounted without\r\nmetal supports.\r\n\r\nA ligament which gives way may be replaced by some fibres of raw cotton\r\nsaturated with glue. While cleaning the bone for a ligamentary skeleton\r\nit should be kept damp until it is given the final attitude. Water with\r\na few drops of carbolic acid should be used for this. A bath with\r\nchloride of lime solution will help to whiten the bones, though very\r\ngreasy ones call for an application of benzine.\r\n\r\nFish, reptiles, etc., demand about the same treatment. The large birds\r\nand quadrupeds are usually cleaned bone by bone, and each joint\r\narticulated in the laboratory, though their preservation in the field as\r\nrough skeletons require similar methods.\r\n\r\nThe main rule in collecting skeletons is to never, never lose a bone or\r\nanything of a bony nature attached to the specimen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nSPORTSMEN'S TROPHIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs our game becomes scarcer I believe there will be more demand for the\r\npreservation of the sportsman's trophies than in the days of abundance\r\nnow past. Then only a phenomenally rare or large or freakish example\r\nseemed to warrant the trouble and expense of putting in the\r\ntaxidermist's hands. Now the souvenir of a good day's sport or a\r\nmemorable outing is deemed well worth keeping.\r\n\r\nHeads, horns, skins for floor or hangings and fish and game panels for\r\nthe dining room walls have always been in high favor with sportsmen. So\r\nalso are unique articles of use and decoration for the home. The\r\nnaturalist sportsman whose trips are, from force of circumstances, only\r\nlocal can in a short time make a splendid showing by preserving such\r\ngood types of game as he may procure.\r\n\r\nIn mounting birds as hanging dead game it is well to hang the specimen\r\nbefore skinning, in the position wished and if possible sketch it so, at\r\nleast impress its appearance well on the memory. The main points of the\r\nprocess are the same as for ordinary mounting. There are, however, a few\r\nexceptions which I will mention.\r\n\r\nIf one side of a bird is defective in any way it may be mounted with\r\nsuch side next the panel, so often, if the specimen is to have the\r\nbreast or under side displayed, the opening cut is made down the back or\r\non one side. If a pair of birds of the same kind are used on one panel\r\npose them to display the back of one and breast of the other.\r\n\r\nIt will usually be necessary to wire the wings of birds for game panels\r\nso as to adjust them properly, though they are sometimes fixed from the\r\noutside by embedding sharpened wires in the body.\r\n\r\nDucks of all kinds are especially suitable for panels in that their\r\nplumage being stiffer and more durable does not make casing in glass so\r\nnecessary, though most of our game birds can, by proper treatment,\r\ndispense with such protection. One of the most effective duck trophies\r\nwhich I ever saw was a string of three or four small duck rising in\r\nflight apparently from one corner of a room, to the ceiling in the\r\ncenter of the side wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FLYING DUCK. (For wall.)]\r\n\r\nFor this effect they are mounted with wings spread and raised, head and\r\nlegs outstretched. They are hung on nails in the wall in a regularly\r\nascending line, the point of suspension being a wire loop under the wing\r\non the side next the wall. Single birds look well in the same position.\r\nRabbits and squirrels are also mounted as hanging dead game either in\r\ncombination with some of the small game birds or separately. In\r\nselecting panels for this class of work use those finished in a\r\ncontrasting color to the general tone of the specimens, a dark bird on a\r\nlighter panel and the reverse. On all panels and shields smooth rounded,\r\nbeveled or Ogee edges are advisable. Small headings and intricate\r\nmoulding are dust catchers. Wild cats, 'coons, foxes, coyotes, even\r\nbears and pumas gathered by night hunters and dog enthusiasts are\r\nusually best made up as more or less elaborate rugs. As wall and couch\r\nor chair hangings these have no trimming and often no lining except\r\nunder the head. If for any reason the skins are unfit for this the heads\r\ncan generally be used as wall mounts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TIMBER WOLF RUG, FULL HEAD.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEER HEAD HALL RACK.]\r\n\r\nRoom may be found for a few of the smaller specimens mounted whole but\r\nin the average home they are the bugbear of the housekeeper, early\r\nexiled to the attic. A friend of mine has his collection of small game\r\nbirds, occupying the plate rail of his dining room, well out of the way\r\nand admired by many. Well mounted heads and antlers are suitable almost\r\nanywhere that they do not seem crowded. The famous East Room of the\r\nWhite House has some handsome examples. To make them answer a useful\r\npurpose they are made into hall racks, alone and in combination with\r\nfeet. The makers of mounts offer a number of very attractive designs in\r\nthe well-finished hard woods, some provided with plate glass mirrors.\r\nFish make beautiful trophies which lend themselves particularly to wall\r\ndecoration on panels or as framed medallions. How often the mounted\r\ntrophy would save the fisherman's reputation for veracity. Perhaps their\r\nrapidly perishable nature accounts for the rarity of fish trophies. In\r\nconclusion I would say if you are a sportsman try the preliminary or\r\nentire preservation of some of your trophies, at least get them to the\r\ntaxidermist in as good order as you can. Remember no matter how fine a\r\nspecimen may have been, if allowed to be mutilated, become putrid or\r\ndamaged, it can never be entirely repaired.\r\n\r\nThe taxidermist must recall that exigencies of the field are responsible\r\nfor neglect of many details and a nature loving sportsman is a friend\r\nworth having, who will share the contents of a seldom overfull purse\r\nwith you in return for your best efforts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nODDS AND ENDS, TAXIDERMIC NOVELTIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is almost no end to the useful and interesting things an ingenious\r\nperson can turn out in this line. There is quite a demand for the\r\npreservation of the plumage of game birds for millinery use since the\r\nkilling of other birds for this purpose was forbidden. Wings, tails,\r\nheads and breasts, principally, of grouse, pheasants and water fowl so\r\nused do not call up visions of starving nestlings. They need only to be\r\nskinned and poisoned as usual and pinned out to dry in the desired shape\r\noften loosely filling in and some cases wiring with rather small soft\r\nwire. When dry all raw edges or surfaces should be covered with pieces\r\nof cambric or lining canvas glued on.\r\n\r\nAntlers and horns are sometimes worked up into armchairs and two pairs\r\nof small deer antlers turned upside down and screwed to a square of\r\nboard make the foundation of a nice stool. Hat, gun and rod racks of\r\nfeet, antlers and heads in various combinations are mentioned elsewhere\r\nand occasionally some one attempts an electrolier of antlers, mounted\r\neither on the heads or separately.\r\n\r\nTo do this grooves are chiseled out of the back of the antlers to\r\nreceive insulated wire running to each point which is equipped with a\r\nlight bulb. After placing the wires and bulbs and testing, the grooves\r\nare filled with \"mache\" or putty colored to match the other surface.\r\n\r\nPeacock feather and fox tail dusters are fitted with buck horn handles\r\nor those made of fox or wild cat paws. Riding whips will look well with\r\nthe same style handles.\r\n\r\nScreens from mounted birds are highly ornamental, especially those of\r\nframed plush or satin on which birds of contrasting plumage are mounted\r\nin medallion style. It would be hard to find a more beautiful object\r\nthan a snow white heron medallion on a black velvet screen framed in\r\ngold. These medallions are mounted by flattening the subject\r\nconsiderably so it is in little more than half relief.\r\n\r\nA number of small birds may be mounted on a satin covered screen with\r\nembroidered branches and foliage. Some of the smaller fur bearers have\r\nbeen used in this way with success.\r\n\r\nSome artists have specialized in grotesque mounting of small specimens,\r\nsingly and in groups. Frogs, toads and squirrels are best suited to such\r\ncaricature work.\r\n\r\nA foot muff can be made up from scraps of fur and will be appreciated in\r\ncold climates on long rides and indoors as well sometimes. To make this\r\na covering of the size and shape of a foot stool is made of carpet or\r\nsimilar material. The bottom and sides are of this and the top of some\r\nshort fur. A slit is made in this top and a bag of long fur or wool is\r\nsewed into the slit so when the muff or stool is loosely filled with tow\r\nand excelsior the feet may be thrust down into the fur lined pocket. The\r\nhead of a fox or wildcat in half relief put on top, over the feet will\r\ngive a finish to it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOOT MUFF, TRIMMED WITH HEAD AND TAILS.]\r\n\r\nA novelty in fur rugs is to mount the skin of some small animal in the\r\ncenter of a larger one of contrasting color. The so-called Plates of\r\nblack goat are often so used with a fox, coon, or lynx in the center.\r\n\r\nTo do this mount the fox as for a half head rug, when dry and shaped cut\r\nout a paper pattern the exact size of it. Apply this pattern to the back\r\nof the goat plate, mark around it and cut out, leaving the opening a\r\nlittle smaller than pattern. Be sure pattern was right side up. Sew the\r\nskin in from the back, wad and line it. A felt trimming is unnecessary\r\non this rug.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MONKEY CARD RECEIVER.]\r\n\r\nMatch safes, candle holders, and similar things are made from the heads\r\nof fish and ducks with metal containers fastened in their open mouths.\r\nMonkeys, bear cubs and alligators mounted erect with card trays are\r\nquite striking while foxes or raccoons peering over the edge of umbrella\r\njars or waste baskets are equally so. Many animals are mounted in\r\nGermany for advertising purposes, being either sold outright or rented\r\nby the month. Some of these are really a form of slot machine with coin\r\nactuated mechanisms while others are motor driven, attracting attention\r\nas moving displays always do. Bears and foxes on swings and seesaws and\r\nvarious small animals on merry-go-rounds are always attractive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nGROUPS AND GROUPING.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis subject is more of interest to the museum preparator than the home\r\ntaxidermist, but a short consideration of it is not out of place here.\r\n\r\nMany instructive and pleasing little groups of our smaller mammals and\r\nbirds can be prepared for display in the home. Such groups usually\r\nrequire casing for protection but are well worth the trouble and\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nAlways try to make a group mean something. Let the subjects be feeding,\r\nfighting or occupied in any natural way. Family groups showing the male\r\nand female, adults and young, in the home surroundings are always good.\r\n\r\nThe seasonal groups of Spring, Autumn, Summer and Winter have been\r\nproduced by most bird taxidermists at some time. Appropriate varieties\r\nof small birds are the blue birds for Spring; gold finches, Autumn;\r\nyellow birds or tanagers, Summer; snow birds, Winter. Framed with\r\npainted backgrounds and suitable accessories their shallow wall cases\r\nmay be hung like pictures.\r\n\r\nNever make the mistake of grouping animals that would never meet in\r\nnatural circumstances or furnish them with incongruous surroundings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SQUIRRELS--GREY, RED, FLYING, GROUND (CHIP MUNK)]\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of groups for the exhibition cases of museums is very\r\nexacting as they are made open to the view on all sides. In order to\r\njudge of the affect such groups are modelled in miniature clay figures\r\nwhich are changed and re-arranged until satisfactory before the mounting\r\nis begun.\r\n\r\nSuch work is rather out of our province but an intelligent arrangement\r\nof two or more figures can be made to convey many more ideas than a\r\nsingle one would suggest.\r\n\r\nSome of the most striking groups are those of the larger carnivora in\r\ncombat, but they hardly possess the real value of painstaking life\r\nstudies of some of our more familiar kindred of the wild.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nANIMAL ANATOMY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA knowledge of this subject coupled with the necessary mechanical\r\nability will enable their possessor to take place in the front ranks of\r\ntaxidermists. Even if we have but little opportunity to study the\r\nanatomy of some of the rarer varieties of animal forms we can inform\r\nourselves of certain typical features possessed in common by other more\r\ncommon members of the same great family or species.\r\n\r\nPress and camera supplies us with much reliable information on the\r\nsubject. Books on natural history, travels and sports were never so\r\ncomplete, interesting, and withal, so easy of access as they are\r\nnowadays.\r\n\r\nA great help to the naturalist is a collection of pictures such as\r\nappear from time to time in periodicals. Back numbers of magazines on\r\noutdoor life and sports will contribute quantities of these, most of\r\nthem reproduced from photographs and in a short time a large collection\r\nof such can be made. Packing these in the pockets of a letter file will\r\nkeep them together, and at the same time make it possible to withdraw\r\nany one or more for inspection when wanted.\r\n\r\nPhotos of dead animals are not particularly valuable but casts always\r\nare; make them whenever opportunity offers. Not so much casts of the\r\nentire specimen as casts of various details.\r\n\r\nGet a set of moulds of the noses of say deer, moose, domestic cattle and\r\nsheep and keep the resulting casts for reference. Their value will be\r\napparent when mounting heads. Any sketches, however rough, will also be\r\nof use.\r\n\r\nThe circus and zoo will furnish feast days for the student of animal\r\nanatomy and pencil and camera may be used freely at both with the\r\nassurance of the best of treatment from officials and keepers.\r\n\r\nA visit to the meat market will afford opportunity for study of the\r\nmuscular system of the domestic animals.\r\n\r\nThe sculptor builds up his clay model unhampered by fur, feathers or\r\nbones and chisels out his statuary on a scale determined by himself\r\nwhile the taxidermist must not only construct his figures or manikins in\r\ncorrect proportions, but make them fit a certain skin. Hence it behooves\r\nhim even more than the sculptor to be well grounded in at least the main\r\nprinciples of the anatomy of animals.\r\n\r\nBirds in particular are a fruitful source of study, muffled as they are\r\nin feathers, when stripped presenting a very different appearance. To\r\nillustrate the value of a knowledge of avian anatomy I will mention an\r\nincident occurring many years ago at a large taxidermy establishment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WATER FOWL HEAD.]\r\n\r\nTwo of the frugal minded workmen having skinned a large plump duck laid\r\nthe body minus head, feet, and wings aside to furnish a dinner next day.\r\nThe porter regarding same as his perquisite abstracted and hid it. The\r\nfirst owners discovering it substituted the body of a large horned owl\r\nthen in the process of mounting and so made all concerned happy. The\r\nporter bragging loudly next day of the fine duck he had done them out\r\nof, they were able to convince him of the truth only by exhibiting the\r\nduck remains as a part of their lunch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nCASTING AND MODELLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the leading authorities in this country has aptly said, \"The\r\nideal taxidermist must be a combination of modeller and anatomist,\r\nnaturalist, carpenter, blacksmith and painter. He must have the eye of\r\nan artist and the back of a hod carrier.\" This should not dismay the\r\nbeginner for such casting and modelling as will be indispensable are\r\ncomparatively simple.\r\n\r\nIn order to cast we must have molds and in our work these are chiefly of\r\nplaster. They are divided into two classes known as piece and waste\r\nmolds. As the names indicate the latter is wasted or destroyed after\r\nmaking one copy while the piece variety can be used for a number of\r\nreproductions. The piece mold is divided into sections in such a way as\r\nwill allow its removal without injury to either mold or cast. The waste\r\nmold is made from soft or fleshy objects which can be drawn from it in\r\nspite of projections known as undercuts.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration let us procure a cast of a deer's nose for reference\r\nin mounting the head later. For our purpose we wish a cast of the nose\r\nand lips, so with the head in the flesh at hand, the hair as far back as\r\nthe corner of the mouth is coated with clay water to prevent the liquid\r\nplaster from penetrating and adhering. This done the head is propped up\r\non the table and a rough box arranged around it, which will reach nearly\r\nto the mouth as the head is placed with nose uppermost. Pour sand in\r\nthis box until only as much of the nose projects as is desired to cast.\r\n\r\nNow mix in a bowl or basin a sufficient amount of water and plaster of\r\nparis to cover the surface of the deer's nose about 1/4 inch thick. This\r\nshould be of the consistency of cream and enough bluing or lampblack\r\nshould be added to give it a decided tint.\r\n\r\nIf the skin of the lips and nose is disposed naturally the plaster may\r\nbe ladled on with the spoon, endeavoring to get about an even coating.\r\nWash any remaining bits from the dish and mix say twice the amount of\r\nplaster without coloring. Distribute this over the other and allow to\r\nharden, which they will do in about 20 minutes. A little careful work\r\nwill withdraw this mold from the nose and it may either be laid aside or\r\nused at once in making the cast.\r\n\r\nTo do this brush the inside with clay water and pour it full of plaster.\r\nShake well to prevent bubbles and when hardened chisel away the mold. In\r\ndoing this lay it on the lap or a cushion and chip off the mold. When\r\nthe first layer (the colored one) appears work with caution to avoid\r\nmarring the cast.\r\n\r\nIf a wire loop was inserted before the plaster hardened the cast may be\r\nhung on the wall for future reference.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE PIECE MOULD OF HEAD.]\r\n\r\nThe preparation of a piece mold is somewhat different. A mold can be\r\nmade in two pieces of a round object like a ball and if each piece is\r\nexactly one-half, it will draw, because there is no point under which\r\nthe plaster will hold. Any hollows or projections will form \"under cuts\"\r\nnecessitating making the mold in a number of pieces that it may relieve\r\nor be lifted off the cast. Molds of heads from which to cast paper forms\r\nare often wanted and are easily made. With the skinned head of a fox,\r\nlet us say, on the table, the lower part is embedded in fine sand or\r\nclay about on a line with the mouth. Cover half of the exposed upper\r\npart of the head also with clay. Pour to the depth of at least 1/2 inch\r\non the remainder.\r\n\r\nRemove the clay from the other half of the face, and after\r\ncountersinking two or three shallow holes in the edge of that part of\r\nmold already made and coating that edge with clay water, pour plaster\r\nfor the second piece of mold. When this hardens pick up head from its\r\nbedding of sand or clay and turn over so the final piece of model can be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nAlways coat the edges with shellac or clay water to prevent adhesion and\r\ncountersink a few holes for dowels to aid in holding the pieces in\r\nplace. Dry out thoroughly and shellac the whole interior and joining\r\nedges. If it is slightly oiled before using a great number of casts may\r\nbe made from it. This will give us a complete cast of a fox head with\r\nclosed mouth.\r\n\r\nA shorter method to obtain molds of the upper part of the head and face\r\nfor making paper half-head forms, is to imbed in sand or clay as\r\ndirected and stick a piece of stout thread or cord along the central\r\nlines of the head and face. A little clay will hold this in place and\r\nthere should be a few inches surplus at each end. Mix the plaster and\r\ncover the entire top and sides of the head with it. Just as the plaster\r\nbegins to harden draw the thread upward through the stiffening plaster\r\ncutting it in two parts which are easily removed when hard. When dry\r\ncoat with shellac, tie together and they are ready for use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAKING MOULD FOR HALF HEAD.]\r\n\r\nTo cast half head forms soak some paper and after coating one side with\r\npaste, press into the mold with the fingers. The first layer should be\r\nquite soft so as to crowd into all depressions. About six layers of\r\nbuilding paper is thick enough for a fox head size. When dry cut the\r\ncords and detach the mold.\r\n\r\nMolds for deer head forms are made in two pieces, one for each side of\r\nthe head, and are necessarily not carried completely around the antlers.\r\nThis gap is just filled in the head form by the plate of bone bearing\r\nthe antlers, which is sawed from the skull.\r\n\r\nThe entire neck may be molded in connection with the head if desired.\r\nGelatine and compositions of glue and wax are used for molds where fine\r\ndefinition is desirable, and wax as well as plaster and paper for making\r\ncasts. The ground up paper pulp is used for many casts, pressing it into\r\nmold with fingers and spatulas.\r\n\r\nClay is the stand-by of the taxidermist modeller. That furnished by art\r\ndealers is best, but for common use potter's clay is all that is\r\nnecessary. A little glue mixed in plaster delays its setting and makes\r\nit harder when dry. Good papier mache is one of the best materials for\r\nmuch modelling and wax for very fine work. Tools for this work may be\r\npurchased or home made of wood, bone or metal.\r\n\r\nMany forms of fishes and reptiles are difficult or impossible to mount\r\nby ordinary methods. On these the caster and modeller may work his will,\r\nand if he also possesses a good eye for color the results may be of the\r\nbest. As an indisputable record of anatomy even a poor cast is valuable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nMARKET TROPHY HUNTING.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this country and day of conservation this would seem like a delicate\r\nsubject to attack. The hunter for the trophy market a few years back was\r\nslaying elk, mountain sheep, moose, deer, or antelope indiscriminately.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEER FOOT INK WELL AND PEN RACK.]\r\n\r\nWhile modern game laws have changed or at least modified this I can see\r\nno reason why a hunter who is entitled to a certain head of game per\r\nseason should not utilize them fully by preparation and sale to others\r\nwho have not similar opportunities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOUNTAIN LION OR PUMA HIDE.]\r\n\r\nWhat would often be left in the woods as useless, as indeed it would be\r\nfor food purposes, is transformed into a beautiful and decorative\r\narticle of considerable commercial value. Often things being equal the\r\ntrophy hunter will avoid killing young and female game animals on\r\naccount of the worthlessness of their heads as trophy if not for any\r\nethical reason.\r\n\r\nWhile the day of trophy hunting as a business in the United States is\r\npast probably, by preserving such heads, horns, feet and skins as come\r\nin his way the trapper, prospector and settler can often add\r\nconsiderably to his income. For instance, from one to five deer may be\r\nlegally killed in different states. If two good heads are taken, worth\r\nsay $15.00 and $20.00 each when prepared, that sum would go far towards\r\npaying the expenses of an enjoyable outing.\r\n\r\nThe fur trapper will frequently take some animal the skin of which may\r\nfor many reasons be of little value. The puma or mountain lion is such a\r\none, worth but $2.00 or $3.00 usually, the mounted head is a striking\r\nwall ornament and the skin is suitable for couch or floor.\r\n\r\nThough fur dealers will make some deduction from the regular prices on\r\nskins from which the heads are removed, it is vastly more profitable to\r\nretain them and preserve as trophies.\r\n\r\nHorns and antlers and head skins or scalps of all our large game have a\r\ncertain value either separately or together. Mounted heads, damaged by\r\nmoth create a demand for extra scalps and separate antlers are often\r\ncalled for. Extra large heads or antlers of freakish formation seem to\r\npossess a special fascination for the public.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPRING LAMB? COON HEAD.]\r\n\r\nCommercial fishermen handling fish in large numbers would do well to\r\npreserve at least a few of the more notable specimens of their catch.\r\n\r\nIn some localities there is every summer an opportunity to supply\r\n\"rusticators\" with rattlesnake skins which may be prepared for wall\r\ndecorations or use as belts, hat bands, card-cases, and neck ties. They\r\nshould be packed in salt until tanned as drying out while in the raw\r\nstate is apt to spoil them. On account of the snake's habit of shedding\r\nits skin at varying intervals, dressing snake skins is rather of the\r\nnature of a lottery. The dressed skins should be made up with a backing\r\nof some other leather as it is apt to possess but little strength of\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nIn localities where the tarpon, tuna, muscallonge, and other large fish\r\nare caught it is well to keep some good specimens on hand as such are\r\noften in demand to substantiate a fish story.\r\n\r\nIn a word, gather and preserve some of the best objects of animated\r\nnature your locality affords, whether fur, fin or feather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nCOLLECTING AND MOUNTING FOR SALE.\r\n\r\n\r\nCommercial taxidermy is roughly divided in two branches, custom work,\r\nand collecting and mounting for sale. For the first you need some fixed\r\nplace of business easy of access to the public and convenient to lines\r\nof transportation. The latter may be taken up anywhere if a demand has\r\nbeen noted and a market assured or in prospect.\r\n\r\nTravelers in little known parts of the country often pay their expenses\r\nor even gain considerable profit by collecting desirable specimens of\r\nanimal life. As a side line on pleasure trips it is sometimes\r\nremunerative. Woodsmen and fishermen will often find it to pay better to\r\npreserve for mounting part of their game at least.\r\n\r\nThe sales end of the proposition is the most difficult for the outdoor\r\nman. Such work has not the fixed (?) value of furs and meat. There are a\r\nnumber of dealers in naturalists' material who aim to keep on hand a\r\npretty complete stock of specimens for museum purposes. Correspondence\r\nwith these will procure their want lists.\r\n\r\nMany more deal in unmounted trophies of heads, horns and rug skins.\r\nOccasionally an order for small and common species may be secured from\r\nsome school or college. Such institutions will often place an order for\r\ndesirable material with a prospective traveler.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOOKCASE ORNAMENTS--CROW; ALLIGATOR (Fisherman from the\r\nEverglades); OWL.]\r\n\r\nFinally it is well to mount a good specimen or two of almost any variety\r\non general principles. It is astonishing how difficult it is to procure\r\nsome very common species on the spur of the moment. If you accumulate a\r\nnumber of nicely done and attractive specimens it is possible to secure\r\ntheir sale on commission.\r\n\r\nAs such things are apt to draw attention as a window or wall display\r\nsome druggist, sporting goods dealer or other business man may be glad\r\nto aid in their disposal. In or near a game country the local hotels\r\nwill help advertise you by giving wall space in dining room or office to\r\nsuitable pieces accompanied by a business card. Donations to libraries,\r\nschools and other public and semi-public institutions will keep you more\r\nor less in the public mind.\r\n\r\nEndeavor to fill any orders you receive even if obliged to purchase at\r\nsuch rates that no profit remains.\r\n\r\nDo not diminish the animal life of your locality by collecting\r\neverything you can lay your hands on. It would be time misspent and\r\nmostly unrewarded.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nPRICES FOR WORK.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo those who hope to coin spare hours into dollars and cents, or others\r\nwho must make a hobby pay its own expenses at least, an important\r\nquestion is, what is my work worth?\r\n\r\nAnd one will concede that a taxidermist should receive at least as much\r\nas a skilled mechanic and the experts both in commercial and museum work\r\nare sometimes (not always) highly paid.\r\n\r\nWhat seems the fairest method of compensation is by \"piece work\" and\r\nmost custom taxidermy is handled on that basis. Most professionals have\r\na regular scale of prices which, while necessarily more or less elastic,\r\nwill give the public an estimate of cost.\r\n\r\nThe schedule which I give is, I think, about that in use in the Eastern\r\nStates. The outside prices are for extra large specimens or those\r\nmishandled or injured so as to require an extra expenditure of time to\r\ngive satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRICES FOR MOUNTING SPECIMENS.\r\n\r\n  BIRDS.\r\n\r\n    Small Wrens, Canary,                  $ 1.00 to $ 1.50\r\n    Robins, Jays, and similar,              2.00 to   2.50\r\n    Medium Quail, Snipe, Dove, Woodcock,    2.50 to   3.00\r\n    Large Crow, Grouse, Duck,               3.00 to   4.00\r\n    Larger Horned Owls, Fish\r\n    Hawk, etc.,                             4.50 to   5.00\r\n    Eagle, Turkey, Pea Fowl,               10.00 to  15.00\r\n\r\n    Birds with spread wings add 25 per cent.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MAKING BIRD SKINS.\r\n\r\n    Small up to size of Sparrow,                      .20\r\n    Robin, Jay, etc.,                                 .25\r\n    Pigeon, Hawk, and similar,                        .35\r\n    Screech Owl, Green Heron,                         .50\r\n    Crow, Teal,                                       .75\r\n    Large Hawks, Ducks,                             $1.00\r\n    Herring Gull, Eider Duck,                        1.25\r\n    Great Horned Owl, Fish Hawk,                     1.50\r\n    Eagle, Goose, Swan,                              2.50\r\n\r\n\r\n  WHOLE ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n    Mouse, Mole, Chipmunk,               $ 1.50 to $ 2.00\r\n    Squirrels, Weasels,                    2.00 to   3.00\r\n    Mink, Muskrat, Opossum, Rabbit,        3.00 to   4.00\r\n    Skunk, Woodchuck,                      4.00 to   5.00\r\n    Coon, Fox, Wildcat,                    6.00 to  10.00\r\n    Dogs,                                 10.00 to  35.00\r\n    Domestic Sheep,                       25.00 to  40.00\r\n    Bear, Mountain Lion,                  20.00 to  75.00\r\n    Deer, Antelope,                       30.00 to  75.00\r\n\r\nPrice on whole mounted specimens include rustic stands, stumps, or rock\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n  HEADS.\r\n\r\n    Elk, Moose, Steer,                    $20.00 to 40.00\r\n    Caribou, Mountain Sheep,               15.00 to 25.00\r\n    Deer (buck), Antelope,                  7.50 to 12.00\r\n    Deer (small), common sheep,             5.00 to 10.00\r\n    Bears,                                  7.50 to 15.00\r\n    Wolf,                                   5.00 to  7.50\r\n    Fox, Wildcat, Raccoon, etc.,            4.00 to  6.00\r\n    Hawks, Owls, Eagles,                    2.00 to  3.00\r\n    Fish,                                   2.00 to  5.00\r\n\r\nSuitable shields or panels are included.\r\n\r\n\r\n  FISH, REPTILES, ETC.\r\n\r\n    Small fish,                           $ 2.00 to  5.00\r\n    Medium, Bass, etc.,                     5.00 to 10.00\r\n    Large, Tarpon, Salmon,                 10.00 to 25.00\r\n    Snakes, as to size,                     5.00 to 25.00\r\n    Alligators,                             1.50 to 25.00\r\n\r\n\r\n  MOUNTING HORNS, INCLUDING SHIELDS.\r\n\r\n    Deer,                                 $ 2.50 to  5.00\r\n    African Horns,                          2.50 to 10.00\r\n    Cow, Steer,                             2.50 to  5.00\r\n    Caribou,                                3.50 to  7.00\r\n    Moose, Elk,                             5.00 to 10.00\r\n\r\n\r\n  SKINS.\r\n\r\n    First column shows cost of tanning only; second of tanning,\r\n    mounting 1/2 head and lining as rug; third of complete rug\r\n    with open mouth.\r\n\r\n    Black Bear,                       $4.00 $10.00 $15.00\r\n    Mountain Lion, Jaguar,             3.00  10.00  15.00\r\n    Tiger,                             5.00  15.00  20.00\r\n    Wolf,                              2.00   8.00  12.00\r\n    Coyote, Lynx,                      1.50   7.50  10.00\r\n    Fox, Wild Cat, Coon, House Cat     1.00   5.00   6.00\r\n    Sheep,                             1.50   ....   ....\r\n    Goat,                              1.50   8.00   ....\r\n    Deer,                              2.50  10.00   ....\r\n    Opossum, Muskrat,                   .50   ....   ....\r\n    Mink,                               .75   ....   ....\r\n    Snake,                             1.00 and up\r\n    Alligator,                         2.00 and up\r\n\r\n\r\n  NOVELTIES.\r\n\r\n    Deer Feet, each,                       $2.00 to 3.00\r\n    Moose and Elk Feet,                     3.00 to 4.00\r\n\r\nIncluding fittings.\r\n\r\n\r\nROBES.\r\n\r\nAccording to size and variety of skins from $15.00 to $25.00 including\r\ntanning, sewing up and linings. The smaller skins of course require the\r\nmost work.\r\n\r\nDomesticated animals, dogs, cats, cage birds, etc., are mounted at the\r\nrates for similar sized wild specimens. Inasmuch as they are of value\r\nonly for associations most taxidermists require a small advance payment\r\non pet animals before commencing work; other work is usually C. O. D.\r\n\r\nA discount of 10 to 20 per cent is often made for large quantity or to\r\nthose in the fur trade who may be so induced to secure orders.\r\n\r\nIt would pay for at least one person in every furriers shop to have a\r\nknowledge of taxidermy and a connection with some dealer in sportsmen's\r\ngoods is often of advantage.\r\n\r\nMuch of this matter of prices must be left to your own judgment. Often a\r\nfair profit can be made on work taken at a low figure during the \"off\r\nseason.\" Perishable work demanding instant attention should receive the\r\nbest pay and pieces which may be picked up in odd moments, thus using\r\ntime otherwise valueless, may be figured near the foot of the scale. The\r\npublic appreciates work thoroughly done and it is the very best\r\nadvertisement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFUR-FISH-GAME\r\n\r\nA Practical Monthly Magazine for Outdoorsmen Devoted to\r\n\r\n#Hunting, Trapping, Fishing, Fur Farming, Etc.#\r\n\r\n\r\nFUR-FISH-GAME IS _just_ the magazine you have been looking for.

As a happy combination\r\nof dress and ornament furs will always continue to lead. At the present\r\ntime the manufacture of furs has been highly developed, with the aid of\r\nmachinery and specialized workmen it is conducted on a scale which\r\ncompares favorably with any business activity. However, the principals\r\nremain the same, and good results can still be attained by hand labor.\r\nTo the average outdoor man it is a positive pleasure to see the stiff,\r\ndirty, raw skin develop into the soft, clean, flexible material, and\r\nlater to shape it into a protection from the cold and an ornament\r\ncombined.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Home Manufacture of Furs and Skins]\r\n\r\nThis new, practical and only book on the subject contains 285 pages, 91\r\nillustrations, 34 chapters, and offers at a small cost a way for you to\r\nlearn a pleasant and profitable business enabling you to tan, dye, dress\r\nand manufacture not only your own catch but to engage in the business if\r\nyou wish.
