AIED\r\n  JAMES ST., COVENT GARDEN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis little treatise is intended as an inducement to young Gardeners\r\nespecially, to seek for the reasons on which the operations of their daily\r\npractice are founded, and by which they are regulated. This announcement\r\nis here made, in order to prevent any reader from supposing that the\r\nauthor has unduly estimated the opinions of those who have benefited by a\r\nlong course of application and experience. As, however, there can be no\r\ndoubt that there is much to be learned, so is there but little question\r\nthat there is also much to be unlearned, in the present state of the\r\nScience of Horticulture; and these pages are offered without hesitation,\r\nas a mite among the accumulating mass of available information on\r\ngardening subjects; and in the hope that some amongst those who are\r\nseeking to extend their knowledge, may at least be stimulated by their\r\nperusal, if they are not otherwise directly benefited.\r\n\r\nThe great truths which it is the object of this treatise to impress, are\r\nthese: that the ultimate success of gardening operations does not depend\r\non the performance of any part of them, at a particular time, or in a\r\nparticular or even superior manner, but rather upon the supplying, in a\r\nnatural manner, as far as possible, _all the conditions_ which are\r\nnecessary to the nutrition and perpetuation of plants; and, that it is\r\nwithin the open pathway of Science, and not the bye-ways of empiricism,\r\nthat the finger-post of direction should be sought.\r\n\r\nRoyal Botanic Garden, Regent's Park,\r\n\r\nMarch 2nd, 1844.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE SECOND EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the present edition, it has been thought best to preserve the original\r\ntext exactly as it appeared in the first edition. The new matter will be\r\nfound in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nThe author may take this opportunity of returning his thanks to those who\r\nhave noticed and commended the former edition, and of expressing a hope\r\nthat the present will receive an equal share of favour.\r\n\r\nCamden Town, Aug. 1, 1847.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  CHAP.

I.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY REMARKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Cucumber, _Cucumis sativa_, is supposed to be a native of the East\r\nIndies; but like many other of our culinary plants, the real stations\r\nwhich it naturally has occupied, are involved in obscurity: in habit it is\r\na trailing herb, with thick fleshy stems, broadly palmate leaves, and\r\nyellow axillary monæcious flowers. In the natural arrangement of the\r\nvegetable kingdom, the genus of which it forms part, ranks in the first\r\ngrand class, _Vasculares_, or those plants which are furnished with\r\nvessels, and woody fibre; in the sub-class _Calycifloræ_, or those in\r\nwhich the stamens are perigynous; and in the order _Cucurbitaceæ_, or that\r\ngroup, of which the genus _Cucurbita_, or Gourd family is the type.\r\n\r\nThe affinities of this order, are chiefly with _Loasaceæ_, and\r\n_Onagraceæ_; with the former it agrees in its inferior unilocular fruit,\r\nhaving a parietal placentæ, and with the latter, in its definite\r\nperigynous stamens, single style, and exalbuminous seeds. It has also some\r\naffinity with _Passifloraceæ_, and _Papayaceæ_, in the nature of the\r\nfruit, and with _Aristolochiaceæ_, in its twining habit, and inferior\r\novarium. M. Auguste St. Hiliare, also regards it as being related to\r\n_Campanulaceæ_, in the perigynous insertion of the stamens, the single\r\nstyle with several stigmas, the inferior ovarium, and in the quinary\r\ndivision of the floral envelope, in connection with the ternary division\r\nof the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe properties of the plants comprised in this natural family, are not\r\nnumerous; a bitter laxative quality pervades many of them, a familiar\r\nexample of which is the resinous substance called Colycinthine, the\r\nproduction of the Colocynth gourd, in which the active purgative principle\r\nis concentrated, rendering it drastic, and irritating. Among our native\r\nplants the roots of _Bryonia dioica_, in common with the perennial roots\r\nof all the plants in the order, possess these purgative properties. On the\r\nother hand, the seeds are sweet, yielding an abundant supply of oil; and\r\nit may be worthy of remark, that they never partake of the properties of\r\nthe pulp with which they are surrounded in the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe Cucumber does not possess the properties common to the order, in very\r\npowerful degree; its fruit is however too cold for many persons, causing\r\nflatulency, diarrhoea, and even cholera; by others, it may be eaten with\r\navidity, without producing any injurious effects.\r\n\r\nThe names by which the Cucumber is recognised by the Hindoos, are\r\n_Ketimon_, and _Timou_. In the French, it is called _Concombre_; in the\r\nGerman, _Gurke_; and in the Italian, _Citriuolo_. As a cultivated plant,\r\nit is of nearly equal antiquity with the Vine; being mentioned by the\r\nwriter of the Pentateuch, as being cultivated extensively in Egypt, above\r\n3000 years since.\r\n\r\nThe cultivation of this plant, and the production of fine fruit at an\r\nearly season, is an object of emulation among gardeners of the present\r\nday; and from this cause, many important improvements in the mode of its\r\ncultivation have been effected. The vast increase of means, arising from\r\nan acquaintance with powerful agents, formerly unknown, which are\r\navailable by the present and rising races of gardeners, enable them to\r\nsecure the same important results which cost their predecessors much both\r\nof labour and anxiety, with a comparatively small amount of the former,\r\nand a degree of certainty at which they could never arrive. The agents\r\nwhich an enlightened age has brought under controul, are indeed powerful\r\nengines, which require much skill in their adaptation and management; but\r\nthe knowledge necessary to effect this, is so firmly and inseparably\r\nconnected with the first principles of cultivation, that an acquaintance\r\nwith these, will at all times supply a safe and unerring guide to their\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nIt is to assist the young gardener in this application of principles, to\r\nthe growth of the Cucumber in the winter season, that these pages are\r\ndesigned; and of those who may differ from the opinions which are here\r\nexpressed, it is only required that they should receive a calm and\r\ndeliberate consideration--a consideration unbiassed by prejudice, and\r\nunmixed with any of that feverish excitement after novelties, which with\r\ngardeners, as well as with all other classes of society, is becoming far\r\ntoo prevalent, and intense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. II.\r\n\r\nON THE STRUCTURES ADAPTED FOR THE GROWTH OF CUCUMBERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will preface the following remarks on the structures adapted for the\r\ngrowth of Cucumbers, by stating, that a forcing house, a pit, and a common\r\nframe, present the means of bringing this fruit to its perfection,\r\nequally, one with the other, provided that a course of cultivation\r\nsuitable to the structure, is followed out; the comparative merits of\r\neach, depend not so much on the nature of the results which may be\r\nobtained by adopting them, as on the facilities they afford for the\r\nattainment of those results.\r\n\r\nThe use of the common frame, and the ordinary hotbed of fermenting manure,\r\nnevertheless involves these difficulties:--the fermentation is liable to\r\nbecome excessive, and that in a very rapid manner, and also to decline as\r\nrapidly; the heat, when declining, cannot be speedily restored in\r\nunpropitious weather; it is materially checked in its action, by that\r\nparticular state of the weather, which renders its efficient action most\r\nessential; it involves almost an infinitude of labour; and after all, it\r\nis uncertain in its action: when such difficulties as these, are overcome,\r\nCucumbers can be grown to perfection, on dung beds, assisted by the common\r\ngarden frame and sash.\r\n\r\nThe brick pit, when heated by fermenting manure, presents difficulties of\r\nthe same nature with the preceeding, though in a less powerful degree: but\r\nwhen these structures are heated by means of hot water, in any of its\r\nvarious modes of application, there need be no irregularity, nor\r\nuncertainty in its action; because the supply of the elements of vegetable\r\ndevelopement, and of the agents by whose aid they are applied, may, to a\r\nvery great extent, go on uninterruptedly.\r\n\r\nA forcing house, whilst it secures all the advantages which are presented\r\nby a pit, combines with these, some important points which are peculiarly\r\nits own: by adopting a pit, we provide a structure of which Cucumbers\r\nmanifest their approval, by thriving equally as well as in their more\r\nancient location on a dung bed; but further than this, a pit enables us to\r\ndispense with much of the labour, and all the filth, and the uncertainty\r\nwhich are consequent on the use of fermenting manure as a means of keeping\r\nup the temperature in which they are grown. In a small forcing house,\r\nbesides these advantages being secured, all the operations of care and\r\nculture, can be performed just when they become necessary, without\r\nexposing the tender foliage of plants which have been submitted to an\r\nartificially elevated temperature, to the chilling influence of cold air,\r\nwhich is admitted whenever the sashes of an ordinary frame or of a pit,\r\nare opened, in order to bestow these necessary attentions. It may be urged\r\nthat a dung bed has still the advantage, on the ground of economy; but\r\nwhen a fair calculation is made of labour and loss or anxiety on the one\r\nhand, and of duration on the other, such an assumption, will be quite\r\nuntenable. Neatness, convenience, certainty, and economy, are the\r\nprincipal points of advantage which are gained by the adoption of pits\r\nheated by means of hot water, over those of a structure, depending for its\r\nsupply of heat, on the aid of fermenting masses; whilst the attainment of\r\na still greater degree both of convenience, and of certainty, which may be\r\nsecured by cultivation in forcing houses, point out at once the advantages\r\nwhich render such houses, preferable to pits.\r\n\r\nThe application of the gutter system of heating, was not long since\r\nthought to be an improvement of great importance, and there can be no\r\nquestion but that it affords a means of regulating the moisture of the\r\natmosphere of hothouses, in conjunction with the temperature, which prior\r\nto its introduction had not been attained; and as such, it is worthy of\r\nextensive adoption: it requires however some judgement in its adaptation\r\nto particular structures, and to render, it suitable, to effect any\r\nparticular object for which it may be employed.\r\n\r\nThe tank system as a means of applying bottom heat, employed either in\r\nconjunction with the gutters, or with ordinary piping, to supply heat to\r\nthe atmosphere, is the most important advance which has hitherto been made\r\ntowards supplying the wants of those plants, which require such peculiar\r\naid; and with reference to the Cucumber, it may be regarded as furnishing\r\na new era in its cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe importance of bottom heat in the culture of tender plants, has always\r\nbeen well known by its practical effects. The mean temperature of the\r\nsoil, at a slight distance below the surface, is universally above that of\r\nthe superincumbent air; and consequently some degree of bottom heat is\r\nalways supplied to plants, in a state of nature. Naturally, by means of\r\nsubterraneous heat, and also by the absorption of the sun's rays during\r\nthe time they are forcibly directed towards the earth, it possesses the\r\nmeans whereby any material degree of cold at the roots of plants is\r\nprevented; and when the soil is acted on by the unveiled sun of an eastern\r\nsky, we cannot but feel certain, that even a considerable amount of heat\r\nmust be experienced: hence arises the importance of taking advantage of\r\nevery ray of sun which our climate affords, when the culture of the\r\nCucumber, or of any native of warmer latitudes, is attempted out of doors\r\nin this country; and also of using every possibly available means of\r\nincreasing rather than diminishing the temperature of the soil: and hence\r\ntoo, in forcing not only the Cucumber, but also every other plant which\r\nrequires to be submitted to a confined atmosphere, and an elevated\r\ntemperature, arises the necessity of providing such a degree of warmth at\r\nthe root, as may tend to keep its vital powers in a vigorous state of\r\naction; it will effect this, by acting in conjunction with moisture, as a\r\nsolvent of the food which is primarily contained in the soil in a solid\r\nform, but can only be taken up by the capillary action of the spongioles\r\nof the roots, when converted into a fluid state. The science of Chemistry\r\nhas taught us that the ingredients composing the soil, act on, and\r\ndissolve, and combine with each other in various ways, sometimes being\r\nsimply dissolved and held in solution, and at other times, entering into\r\nnew combinations, and forming new compounds; but in all cases, the natural\r\nagents, heat and moisture, are necessary to produce these results, and to\r\npresent to the tender roots of plants, food so duly prepared, as to be\r\nfit for their assimilation. Warmth in the soil, acts beneficially also, by\r\npreventing the sudden or undue interruption of the excitability of plants\r\ngrowing in it, which would be likely to result from the lowering of the\r\ntemperature of the plants by evaporation, were it not for the action of\r\nthe antagonist force, existing in and exercised by the heated soil, which\r\nheat, is communicated to, and absorbed by the plants.\r\n\r\nIt may be regarded as an established and universal rule, that all plants\r\nrequire the soil, and the atmosphere in which they are cultivated, to\r\ncorrespond with the natural circumstances under which they flourish; and\r\nas it has been repeatedly ascertained that the soil is naturally a degree\r\nor two above the temperature of the atmosphere, we have certain and\r\nunerring data for the application of bottom heat, and no more powerful\r\nevidence than this can be desired, to condemn at once the application of a\r\n_very powerful degree of heat_, at the roots of plants.\r\n\r\nThe importance of bottom heat in the culture of tender plants, being a\r\npractical fact established beyond question, another consideration arises\r\nas to the best means of producing it, and of regulating its application.\r\nVarious substances and materials have been submitted to a process of\r\nfermentation, and so employed to effect it: stable manure, tanner's bark,\r\nand the leaves of trees, are among the principal of these materials, and\r\neither of them will supply just what the plants require, as truly as these\r\nwants can be supplied by any other means; but from their very nature, they\r\nare violent, and fluctuating, and ephemeral in their action, and setting\r\naside the labour which the employment of them necessarily involves, we\r\nhave in these particulars, the special points in which the tank system of\r\napplying bottom heat far excels them: it is uniform, and constant, in its\r\naction; there need be no apprehension of the soil becoming overheated, for\r\nthe source whence it derives its warmth ought never to boil; neither need\r\nthere be any fear of its decline, or of a want of power, for when once\r\nthoroughly heated, a body of water will part with it in such a manner,\r\nthat a very little attention to the fire, and a very little expenditure of\r\nfuel, will maintain its temperature for an almost incredible length of\r\ntime; and as to power, it never should for a moment form a question,\r\nbecause a powerful degree of bottom heat ought never to be applied: a\r\nclose attention for one or two hours during the twenty four which form a\r\nday, will maintain any apparatus in an effective state of action, if it is\r\nproperly erected. How different is this, to what has been in days now\r\npast! when in rigorous weather, with the heat of his dung bed declining,\r\nthe cultivator knew that at the peril of his crop, he scarcely dared to\r\nattempt to revive it, without involving a more serious because an\r\naccelerated evil; at any rate, if at an immense sacrifice of labour, his\r\ndung casings were replenished piece by piece, he knew too well, that often\r\nmany days would elapse, before their action would be efficient and\r\nsatisfactory, unless indeed an unlimited supply of materials, were in a\r\nconstant state of preparation. By means of the tank, a fire could be\r\nlighted up, and the required effect produced in as many hours, as days\r\nwould have been formerly required.\r\n\r\nWhat has been already advanced, tends to the conclusion, that small\r\nforcing houses are preferable, and in the end more economical than pits\r\nand dung beds; and that the tank as a means of supplying bottom heat, is\r\npreferable to the use of fermenting materials; _because the results in\r\neach case, are more perfectly under controul_. Whilst on this part of the\r\nsubject, I may be allowed to mention an error which is somewhat prevalent:\r\nWe frequently hear of the humid nature of the heat given off by hot water\r\npipes, in comparison with that derived from such appliances, as a flue; it\r\nis not unfrequently asserted, that the heat thus derived is so moist, so\r\ngenial, so peculiarly adapted to plants: there can be no doubt but that\r\nthe heat thus obtained is infinitely preferable to that obtained through\r\nthe medium of flues, generally speaking; but its superiority consists\r\nrather in its purity, its freeness from noxious gasses, than in its\r\npossessing a greater degree of moisture. Heat--that is--caloric, is the\r\nsame, whatever may be the medium by which it may be conducted; and in the\r\ncase of hot water pipes, they give off that which has been conducted to\r\nthem by the water, directly from the fire, the water acting as a mere\r\nconductor; it is difficult to conceive any thing more thoroughly devoid of\r\nmoisture than the heat thus communicated: let any one who doubts this,\r\nplace a damp cloth on a series of hot water pipes when in action, and the\r\nresult will soon work conviction. With these general remarks, I will\r\nproceed to describe the kind of structure which I regard as being\r\npeculiarly adapted to the growth of Cucumbers; and notice some of the\r\nconditions which it is necessary to keep in view: the engraving on the\r\nnext page, represents such a structure.\r\n\r\nThe aspect of the Cucumber house, should be nearly S.S.E; or in other\r\nwords--it should be so regulated between the points south and east, that\r\nwhilst the rays of the sun will be admitted as fully and as early as\r\npossible in the morning, there may be no obstruction offered to their more\r\npowerful action as that body approaches the meridian. In the growth of all\r\ntender plants, light and sun heat are required during the winter months as\r\nwell as in summer, and there can be no greater error as regards the\r\nerection of structures devoted to such purposes, than to provide for their\r\nadmitting the direct rays of the sun in the earlier part of the day, at\r\nthe expense of refracting and thereby weakening, to a greater degree than\r\nis really unavoidable, the power of the noon-tide rays of that\r\ninvigorating and life-sustaining agent: during the summer months, though\r\nplants then require both light and sun heat, yet the case is different;\r\nthe sun's rays have then much greater power, and it is found that their\r\ninfluence is sufficient, without at all times admitting them directly on\r\nthe plants growing in these artificial atmospheres.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe position of the Cucumber house, with reference to the ground line,\r\nmust be determined by local circumstances; if the situation and sub-soil\r\nbe dry, it may be carried below the surface in the manner represented in\r\nthe annexed engraving, of which (_a_) is the ground line, (_b_) the\r\npathway, and (_c_) the lowest point excavated: the same course may be\r\nadopted if the soil, though not naturally so dry as this, can be rendered\r\nso by thorough drainage; but when the ground does not admit of perfect\r\ndrainage, the structure must be sufficiently elevated to avoid the risk of\r\ninjury from the dampness of the locality.\r\n\r\nThe angle of elevation is not, as it is sometimes asserted to be, a point\r\nof indifference, though mathematical accuracy is certainly by no means\r\nrequired: in the annexed engraving, the angle of the roof is about 55°,\r\nthis provides for the admission of the sun's rays in the winter months,\r\nwhen his position is comparatively low in the horizon, to a much greater\r\nextent than could take place if a more ordinary slope were adopted. A\r\nstill more elevated pitch would doubtless effect this object in a still\r\nmore perfect manner; but would not be equally applicable to the\r\nrequirements from a permanent structure, which would be wanted for summer\r\nas well as winter use.\r\n\r\nA reference to the sketch, will at once shew the general nature of the\r\ninternal arrangements. There should be a tank (_d_) supported by brick\r\npiers (_p_) in which a circulation of heated water would supply a genial\r\nwarmth to the soil above, and to the roots of the plants growing in the\r\nsoil; this tank should be heated by a small boiler, conveniently placed\r\nwith reference to adjacent arrangements; a series of iron pipes (_e_)\r\nattached to the same boiler, would supply the requisite heat to the\r\natmosphere. It may perhaps be thought that the application of the gutter\r\nsystem of heating would in this case be preferable; but as there would be\r\na perfect command of moisture, as will be explained further on, it is\r\ndesirable to have dry heat also, under controul, and this can be better\r\neffected by means of the pipes than by adopting the gutter plan of\r\nheating. I cannot in this place forbear protesting against the limited\r\nsurface of piping generally employed in heating plant structures; what is\r\nthought to be just enough to maintain a given temperature, is usually\r\nafter minute calculation, the quantity which is made use of, and the\r\nconsequence is, that under adverse circumstances, the apparatus is\r\nnecessarily worked at its highest pitch; and I believe that the\r\napplication of heat in this form, whether it be by means of an hot water\r\napparatus, or by a common flue, is most inimical to the plants submitted\r\nthereto. The admission of air, is a point which as far as I am aware, has\r\nnever been effected in the manner represented in the sketch: it would be\r\nthus effected;--a series of apertures (_f_) should be provided at\r\nintervals along the front wall, which would externally be closed by small\r\nsliding shutters, and would communicate internally with a chamber (_g_)\r\nformed between the front wall and the side of the tank; this chamber would\r\nalso communicate, by a series of openings, (_h_) with the interior space\r\nabove the water in the tank, and from this space, through the covering of\r\nthe tank, tubes (_m_), also placed at intervals, would be carried up\r\nthrough the soil, close to the side of the wall; these tubes should be\r\nfurnished with caps or valves, so as so admit of the communication being\r\nstopped at any time. In applying this to the admission of air, we must not\r\nloose sight of a series of ventilators, (_i_), placed in the back wall of\r\nthe house, which are of precisely the same nature and construction as the\r\napertures (_f_), already spoken of. I shall have occasion hereafter, to\r\nnotice the admission of air, but it will be well in this place, to explain\r\nthe action of the plan proposed for that purpose: when it is judged that a\r\nchange of the internal volume of air is requisite, the ventilators (_i_)\r\nare to be opened, which admits of a portion of the rarified air to pass\r\noff; the ventilators (_f_) are also to be opened, and by means of the\r\naction of these ventilators on each other, a portion of external air is\r\ntaken in; this enters the chamber (_g_), which is warmed by its contiguity\r\nto the tank, and here becomes partially rarified, and rises to the top of\r\nthe chamber; the apertures (_h_) admit it to the interior of the tank,\r\nwhere it becomes not only thoroughly warmed, but also imbibes a degree of\r\nmoisture proportionate to the degree in which it becomes heated, and\r\nthence it enters the house by the tubes or shafts already spoken of. The\r\nadvantages of warming and moistening the air thus admitted, are very\r\nimportant ones; for when either a cold or dry state, of the atmosphere\r\nprevails, its influence is very injurious to plants in these confined\r\nsituations: cold raw air, when it comes in contact with the tender foliage\r\nof the plants, has the effect of chilling the sap in its progress through\r\ntheir tissue, and thus lessening their excitability, when it should be\r\nincreased; whilst dry air acts as an incessant drain upon the vegetable\r\njuices, which it abstracts through the stomates and pores of the leaves\r\nand stems. When cold air is admitted to any position where it can unite\r\nwith caloric, and not in an equal ratio with moisture, it necessarily\r\nbecomes arid, and in that state it eagerly combines with moisture in any\r\nform with which it can come in contact therewith; and consequently if cold\r\nair is admitted to a plant structure, where it can have the means of\r\ncombining with heat, faster than with moisture, it would be brought into\r\nthis arid state, and would supply its voracious appetite, by abstracting\r\nthe juices of the plant. It is a very important question how far this\r\nstate of things is connected with many of the diseases as they are called,\r\nto which plants are subject; for my own part, I believe it to have a very\r\nconsiderable influence in the production of many of them. A shallow bed of\r\nsoil (_k_), is all that would be required; for in the winter season, there\r\nis nothing gained by encouraging a very luxuriant and gross state of\r\ngrowth: the composition of this soil will be noticed hereafter: beneath\r\nit, and resting on the top of the tank, should be placed a layer of coarse\r\nopen rubble, not less than six inches in thickness; and among this rubble\r\nby means of tubes (_n_), placed at intervals along the bed, I would\r\noccasionally pour considerable quantities of water, in order to maintain a\r\ndue regulation of moisture in, and throughout the soil, among which the\r\nvapour arising from the water would ultimately rise. Beneath the tank a\r\nspace (_o_), might be provided, which would serve admirably either for the\r\ncultivation of Mushrooms, or the forcing of Rhubarb, or Sea Kale.\r\nTransverse partitions should be introduced into the bed of soil, so as to\r\ndivide the roots of each plant from those of its neighbours: this\r\narrangement will admit of a complete succession of plants being\r\nmaintained, by the removal of those which have become old and debilitated,\r\nand the substitution of young and vigorous ones; and this obstruction of\r\nthe roots, will not be injurious, for the Cucumber does not by any means\r\nrequire to be permitted to extend its roots at random, but will readily\r\nsubmit itself to any rational regimen, with regard to the area from whence\r\nit is permitted to extract its food. A portion of soil sufficient to\r\nsupport one or two plants, could by this arrangement be renewed as\r\noccasion might require, and the roots of the contiguous plants would\r\nsuffer no injury from the operation. The pathway of the house, should be\r\npaved so as to admit of its being occasionally washed and cleansed.\r\n\r\nIt will be found to be highly economical in reference to the consumption\r\nof fuel, to provide the structure with the means of being covered at\r\nnight. Shutters of light frame-work, covered with any waterproof material,\r\nwould be found to answer the purpose admirably; they should be elevated a\r\nfew inches from the surface of the glass, and they should be arranged so\r\nas to confine a body of air, which acting as a very slow conductor of\r\nheat, would serve to prevent that incessant drain upon the temperature of\r\nthe internal atmosphere, which takes place when the material employed is\r\nin contact with the glass, as well as when coverings are altogether\r\nabsent. This would not be the only advantage, for as the covering would\r\nto a great extent prevent the radiation of heat from the internal\r\natmosphere, so would it also prevent the necessity of the application of\r\nso powerful a degree of fire heat at night; and thus the plants would be\r\npermitted to enjoy that natural season of repose so essential to their\r\nwell being, instead of being forced into growth by reason of a high\r\ntemperature kept up, solely for the purpose of obviating the external\r\ncold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. III.\r\n\r\nON THE PROPAGATION OF THE CUCUMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nCucumbers are propagated by cuttings, by layers, and by seeds; the two\r\nformer of these methods being frequently practised by those who have\r\nconveniences to keep their plants growing throughout the year; the latter\r\nbeing adopted either through choice or necessity, by the majority of\r\ncultivators, or those whose means will not enable them, even if they\r\ndesired it, to keep up continually a successional growth.\r\n\r\nPropagation by cuttings has many advantages to recommend it, especially\r\nwhen viewed in connection with the production of winter fruit. The plants\r\nraised by this mode of treatment, in comparison with those raised from\r\nseeds, are less gross and succulent in their nature, and more subdued in\r\ntheir manner of growth; whether it may be that having mature and perfectly\r\nformed parts, they are enabled to assimilate their food more rapidly, than\r\nyoung and imperfectly formed plants can do; or whether it is owing to any\r\ndifference in the balance between the roots and leaves, which latter\r\norgans, in cuttings, and the former, in seedling plants, may be regarded\r\nas predominant, does not appear quite evident, probably the effect depends\r\npartly on each of these supposed causes. They are moreover, sooner in\r\narriving at a fruit-bearing state, by reason of a universal natural law,\r\nby which the inflorescence and fructification of a plant becomes more\r\ngeneral and perfect, in proportion as the plant attains proximity to its\r\nperfect developement; which effect, is owing to the more perfect\r\nelaboration and preparation of the materials, which when so prepared,\r\nfurnish the means of perfecting the organs of reproduction. For the same\r\nreason, the operation of budding a portion of a seedling fruit tree, on a\r\nmatured stem, is practised, in order to accelerate its fruitfulness; which\r\nresult generally follows, in consequence of the difference existing in the\r\nnature of the food elaborated by the mature plant, and that deposited by\r\none in an infant state. Thus it is also, that cuttings of flowering plants\r\ngenerally, are far sooner in arriving at a blooming state, than seedling\r\nplants of the same species: flowers and fruit being formed only by the aid\r\nof the perfectly elaborated sap; which is taken up into the system, and\r\nassimilated in the plant, in proportion to the number of healthy and\r\nmature leaves, in a full state of action: during the younger stages of\r\ngrowth, the crude material imbibed from the soil, is only partially\r\nelaborated, and in this state, is only converted into food suitable and\r\ndestined to increase the foliaceous organs; but when these latter are in\r\nfull and vigorous action, a supply of matter, not increased in quantity,\r\nbut enriched in quality, becomes laid up in the store-house and structure\r\nof the plants; and it is by means of this matter, aided by the natural\r\nagents, that the nature of the developement is changed from being simply\r\nthat of the organs of nutrition, to that of the more perfect and important\r\norgans of reproduction. Besides the precocity of plants propagated by\r\ncuttings, there is also another advantage resulting from the practice,\r\nand that is the preservation of particularly desirable varieties; the\r\nCucumber is a plant which readily admits of hybridization, and although\r\nthe result of this is sometimes to give rise to superior varieties, yet if\r\nimpregnation is permitted to take place promiscuously, the bad qualities\r\nof particular varieties, are as likely to be combined in the succeeding\r\nrace, as the good and desirable ones: this renders it important that the\r\nfruit which are preserved for seed, should have been carefully watched and\r\nprotected when in blossom, from the reach of insects; which often effect\r\nthe requisite union, in consequence of the pollen adhering to their\r\nbodies, and thus being brought into contact with the stigma. I need\r\nscarcely to say, that where only one variety is grown in any particular\r\nstructure, the chances of admixture are less numerous.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which the operation of propagation by cutting is performed,\r\nis very simple: the tops of healthy growing shoots are taken off, at about\r\ntwo or three joints in length; they are then planted in deep pots, which\r\nare about half filled with light earth, such as decayed vegetable matter,\r\nand then covered by laying a piece of glass on the top of the pot; a\r\nsimple and effective protection is thus formed, the sides of the pot\r\nacting as a partial shade, the glass admitting light sufficiently abundant\r\nto secure the action of the leaves, and maintaining a calm and moist\r\natmosphere: the pots are to be plunged in a gentle bottom heat, and the\r\ncuttings will soon become rooted; after which they may be treated as\r\nestablished plants.\r\n\r\nPropagation by layers, is another method similar to the last, of which it\r\nis a mere modification; and those points which mark the superiority of the\r\none, are equally applicable in the case of the other. The operation may be\r\nperformed in various ways: thus the branches may be layered at once into\r\nthe soil, when these are trained close to its surface, and they will thus\r\ngrow on with renewed vigour: when required for removal to other positions,\r\nthey may be layered into pots of light soil, in doing which, a convenient\r\nbranch may be brought down, secured firmly at a joint to the soil, and\r\nslightly covered therewith, when it will soon become rooted: another plan,\r\nis, to suspend in convenient places, pots having large holes beneath;\r\nthrough these holes, the points of growing shoots are introduced, and the\r\npots having a little moss in the bottom, are then lightly filled with\r\nvegetable mould: they may also be propagated, by enveloping a joint of a\r\ngrowing shoot lightly with moss; the moss should be kept continually\r\nmoist, and roots will soon be emitted into it, and when enough are\r\nproduced, the plant may be detached.\r\n\r\nEither of these methods of propagation will secure not only healthy, but\r\nfruitful plants, in a short space of time; and this latter point will be\r\nfound to be one of no small advantage. The principal objection which may\r\nbe urged against their adoption, is that they necessarily involve a\r\nprocess of transplantation, which under any circumstances, and however\r\ncarefully performed, must be regarded as an evil rather than otherwise. It\r\nmay be thought that the _check_ arising from transplantation may do good,\r\nby preventing too great luxuriance of growth, and thereby tending to\r\naccelerate fruitfulness; but even if this result may be apparently\r\nproduced by such means, it is surely far more natural to check the plants,\r\nby withholding a portion of food, rather than by mutilating the organs by\r\nwhich their food is conveyed to them, and then actually placing them in a\r\nposition where food is still more abundantly supplied than before. It is\r\nvery questionable however, how far what is called a \"check\" is justifiable\r\nas a means of inducing fructification; for if fructification be the most\r\nperfect state at which a plant can arrive, there does not seem to be much\r\nrationality in adopting any such means as a \"check\" in bringing about\r\nthis perfection of developement. A _check_ applied as a means of\r\naccelerating maturity, can only be regarded as an expedient, rendered\r\nnecessary by previous defective treatment.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly practised as well as the most natural method of\r\npropagation, is by seeds, and this will generally be found to be also the\r\nbest method, if the conditions required by its adoption can be properly\r\ncarried out. There is however, one decided disadvantage attendant on the\r\nraising of Cucumber plants intended for winter forcing from seeds; and\r\nhence in a great measure arises the apparent superiority of propagating by\r\nextension: the disadvantage consists in the exceedingly succulent and lax\r\nnature of the tissue of the young plants; owing to that natural principle,\r\nby which their increase and extension is most especially provided for\r\nduring the infant stages of their existence: the result is, that in\r\nconsequence of the deficiency of light and solar heat, which are the grand\r\nagents of vegetable fructification, their sap does not become sufficiently\r\nelaborated, nor their tissue rendered sufficiently solid by assimilation\r\nand deposition of matter, to bring about the developement of floral parts;\r\nthe food and moisture imbibed, instead of being sublimated and fully\r\nelaborated, is only partially acted on by the vital and natural agents,\r\nand the result is an increase of growth, but not a developement of\r\nfruit-bearing parts. There is nevertheless, an advantage in raising plants\r\nfrom seeds, not only as regards the obtaining of improved races, but also\r\nin a cultural point of view. The science of Horticulture, does acknowledge\r\nsuch a thing as progression, in the developement of plants; the functions\r\nof nutrition necessarily go on prior to those of reproduction or\r\nfructification, the latter being continually dependant on, as well as\r\nbeing the result of the former: hence we arrive at a conclusion, that _to\r\nsupply uninterruptedly_, ALL _the elements which administer to the\r\nnutrition of a plant, is the most rational means of inducing a state of\r\nfruitfulness_. This may at first sight be questioned; cases may readily\r\nenough be quoted, in which food has been bountifully supplied, and the\r\nplants have grown amazingly, but not fruited; if however, food had been\r\nthus supplied, in connexion with a due share of _light_, and an _excess of\r\nheat_ had been avoided, we have natural evidence to prove unquestionably\r\nthat fructification would have followed. An abundance of food, a high\r\ntemperature, and a deficiency of light, are just the conditions which are\r\nopposed to the developement of the floral organs in plants, and are\r\ninductive of mere barren extension: not that plants grow thus, because\r\nthey delight in such a state of things, but because they are thereby\r\nunnaturally excited and compelled to do so, although that growth cannot\r\nunder such circumstances, become properly matured; and hence arises the\r\nimpossibility of their producing blossoms.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of raising plants of Cucumbers from seeds, consists in the\r\nfacility thus afforded of altogether avoiding transplantation: the roots\r\nof Cucumbers are of a very tender nature, and however carefully they may\r\nbe transplanted, they are liable to sustain injury in the removal: by\r\nhaving recourse to depositing the seeds at once in the soil where they are\r\nintended to grow, this is entirely obviated, and there can be no possible\r\nreason why the conditions necessary to germination should not be as fully\r\nsupplied in a hillock of soil, as when a portion of the soil is placed\r\nwithin a garden pot; this vessel can certainly have no influence in\r\nproducing more perfect or healthy germination, whilst the mutilation of\r\neven the most careful act of transplantation, may tend to check the future\r\ndevelopement of the plant.\r\n\r\nIt may be, however, that circumstances prevent the sowing of the seeds at\r\nonce in their ultimate position, and in such cases, they may be sown\r\nsingly in pots partly filled with decayed vegetable mould, plunged in a\r\nmilk-warm bottom heat. The temperature both of the soil and atmosphere\r\nduring this period, should not be high, but such as to permit the plants\r\nto push gradually forth from their dormitory, and assume by a natural\r\nprocess, the functions of active vitality. In order to maintain them in\r\nvigour of constitution, they should be exposed as much as possible to\r\nlight; and that, by being placed near the glass, so as to receive the rays\r\nas little broken and refracted as possible. Water should not be applied at\r\nall, until vegetation has manifested itself, and afterwards, but\r\nsparingly, whilst the plants are young, especially in prolonged periods of\r\ndull sunless weather. Plants which are thus raised, should be planted out\r\nas soon as possible, when their fibres are least numerous, as a means of\r\navoiding in part, the injuries to which they are exposed in\r\ntransplantation.\r\n\r\nWhen the plan of depositing the seeds in the hillock of soil is adopted,\r\nit is necessary to arrange the soil so that any subsequent additions made\r\nto it, may not have the effect of covering too deeply the roots of the\r\nplants, neither of burying the neck of the stem beneath the surface; it\r\nshould be arranged so that this latter may remain elevated above the\r\nsurrounding soil on the top of a slight mound, after the whole of the soil\r\nis adjusted for the roots. I have already mentioned that the depth of soil\r\nought not to be at all considerable, but rather shallow than otherwise, so\r\nas to expose the roots as far as possible to the influence of the sun.\r\n\r\nIt will have been seen that the plan of raising young plants from seeds,\r\nhas both its advantages and its disadvantages; and in order to avoid the\r\nlatter, and secure some of the former, the seeds should be sown early in\r\nthe autumn, whilst there is a sufficiency of heat and light, to mature the\r\ngrowth they make previous to the dull cheerless days which mark the near\r\napproach, and at length the arrival of winter. They will thus be endued\r\nwith the \"stamina\" necessary to sustain them, through that trying period,\r\nand though not without difficulty, yet with comparative certainty, to\r\nreward the well-directed zeal of the cultivator. It is impossible to give\r\nany very minute directions as to the time of performing these operations\r\nof propagation, for like all other gardening operations, it is not at all\r\nrequisite that they should be done on any particular day, nor ought they\r\nto be done except when natural conditions are favourable to success: from\r\nten to twelve weeks generally elapse between the time of sowing the seeds\r\nand the production of fruit, according as the season may be favourable or\r\notherwise.\r\n\r\nThe numerous hybrid varieties which are in cultivation, render it a matter\r\nof some importance to make choice of those most suitable to the purpose;\r\nthese are however so continually changing, that it is useless to attempt a\r\nrecord of them. The Sion house Cucumber is perhaps the best of all suited\r\nfor cultivation in the winter season. The principal features which are\r\nrequired in Cucumbers for winter forcing, are, precocity; compactness of\r\ngrowth, rather than luxuriance; prolificacy, rather than extreme length of\r\nfruit; and hardiness of constitution: these, are to the gardener far more\r\nimportant points, than those which entitle them to rank as \"prize\"\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IV.\r\n\r\nON THE TREATMENT OF THE MATURE PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the time that the plants become established, which is the period of\r\ntheir existence now about to be considered, they require to have the\r\nelements of vegetable growth duly supplied to them, in order to secure\r\ntheir successful developement. It is not enough to plant them in proper\r\nsoil, and duly to water them, unless attention is also paid to the\r\ntemperature, as well as the constituents of the atmosphere to which they\r\nare submitted; neither will attention to these latter points be sufficient\r\nto ensure success, if at the same time, the former are neglected. A _soil_\r\nof suitable chemical, as well as mechanical composition, a pure and\r\nwholesome _atmosphere_, _water_ promptly and properly applied, and _heat_\r\nduly regulated, are conditions which equally require minute care and\r\nattention in their adaptation; and these being applied upon the\r\ncomprehensive, and perfectly harmonious principles of nature, will leave\r\nbut little to be done in the shape of expedients, which are too frequently\r\nresorted to, as the means of counterbalancing either defective or\r\nunsuitable management. The application of these agents to the cultivation\r\nof the plant under consideration, in the winter season, will form the\r\nsubjects of succeeding chapters. I will here briefly direct attention to\r\nthe importance of light in the growth of plants, and then devote some\r\nspace to the consideration of the subject of pruning and training.\r\n\r\nLight is most essential to the perfect and healthy developement of\r\nvegetable organization, the performance of the functions essential to the\r\nhealth of plants being dependent on its agency. It cannot indeed be\r\nassumed that plants will not continue to grow, unless they are supplied\r\nwith an intense degree of light; but it is certain that the successful\r\nnature of their growth, their maturation, and their fructification, are\r\ndependent in no ordinary degree upon the nature and force of its action;\r\nfor without it, the vital energies of animated beings are unable to\r\nmaintain and perform the processes of elaboration, and assimilation, upon\r\nwhich their nutrition depends. The mere extension of vegetable tissue, may\r\nindeed go on, though less satisfactorily, under the almost total privation\r\nof light, but with the exception of cryptogamic vegetation, the organs of\r\nfructification are not under those circumstances, produced at all: the\r\nstem may be formed, but does not become solid: the leaves may expand, but\r\ntheir condition is imperfect; and it is only by means of the full and\r\ncomplete action of these organs in the nutrition of plants, that the\r\ndevelopement of the floral parts is brought about: the roots may take up\r\nfluids, and these may be conveyed in the natural upward channels, and then\r\ndispersed among the stems and the leaves; but it is the action of solar\r\nlight, aided indeed by the natural condition of the elements supplying\r\nheat and moisture, which alone, by a process of elaboration, can convert\r\nthis fluid, once crude and undigested, into the compound organic\r\nsubstances, such as lignin, gum, starch, gluten, &c. which in their turn,\r\nare destined to minister to the support of the organs of reproduction.\r\nGrowth, that is mere extension, may go on in proportion as heat and\r\nmoisture are supplied to plants, but light is the agent to whose especial\r\ninfluence we owe the production of their active properties and secretions,\r\nand the perfection of their fruit.\r\n\r\nIf then light is so indispensable to the vegetable frame, how important it\r\nis that the structures which we devote to the cultivation of such plants\r\nas the Cucumber, which are naturally habituated to an eastern clime,\r\nshould be so designed, as to offer the least possible obstruction to its\r\nentrance: how important, too, that the glass we employ, which in its\r\npurest state, offers considerable obstruction, by refracting the rays of\r\nlight, should be as transparent and untarnished as possible, so as to\r\nadmit them as perfectly as can be practicable; instead of which, it is too\r\noften disfigured by an accumulation and deposit of filth, which, to say\r\nthe least, must materially diminish their force: how important, moreover,\r\nthat whatever coverings it may be necessary to employ during the night to\r\nprevent the outward radiation of heat, should be speedily removed in the\r\nmorning, and kept off as long as they safely may be, in order to permit\r\nthe inward radiation of light. When these matters are all duly attended\r\nto, our climate, at least during the winter, still offers obstruction\r\nenough to our success, in its mists, and fogs, its long dark nights, and\r\ndismal cloudy days, and therefore wisdom would teach us, to avail\r\nourselves of all which we can grasp, by a course of untiring assiduity,\r\nand attention to such apparently trifling matters as these.\r\n\r\nThe pruning and training of the plants, are operations, to which it will\r\nbe necessary to direct attention; and in the performance of which, the\r\ncircumstances which may have any influence upon them, as well as the\r\nobject in view, must be taken into consideration. The plants being\r\nintended to occupy a surface of trellis-work in a line nearly parallel\r\nwith the glass, it will be requisite to train their primary shoots to a\r\nsufficient length to reach from the soil to the trellis, before they are\r\nwhat is technically called \"stopped;\" this operation, by removing the\r\ncentral bud, or axis of developement, induces the buds which are latently\r\nformed at the nodes of the branches, to push forth and become the axes of\r\nfurther extension: two or three of the strongest of these lateral shoots\r\nsituated towards the top of the stem, should be retained, and trained on\r\nthe trellis in a direction towards the top of the house; these shoots\r\nshould be placed about 18 inches from each other, and when they have\r\nreached about one-third of the length of the trellis, they also should be\r\nstopped, and thus several more lateral shoots will be produced. The\r\nuppermost strong shoot should in each case, be still trained in the same\r\nupward direction, and the others must be disposed in the most convenient\r\nform in the space between the main branches: these, that is the young\r\nlateral shoots, if they do not shew a fruit blossom at the second joint or\r\nleaf from the main branch, must be stopped, and the young shoot thus\r\ninduced to push forth, will in all probability have fruit at the first\r\nleaf; if not, it must be stopped at _every leaf_ as it extends, until\r\nfruit is observed. The upper portion of the branch after having extended\r\nabout one-third further up the roof, should be submitted to the same\r\nprocess, and this must be again repeated until the whole of the trellis is\r\ncovered.\r\n\r\nNo reference has yet been made to the treatment of those lateral branches\r\nwhere the young fruit are perceived: these should be permitted to grow\r\nuntil the blossoms have expanded; and then, after this, they should be\r\nstopped at the leaf next beyond the fruit blossoms. By permitting them to\r\ngrow until the flowers have expanded, the attraction of the growing branch\r\nwill continue to draw up a regular supply of nutriment, part of which will\r\nbe devoted in its course, to assist the developement of the blossoms; and\r\nbesides the advantage of the growing point acting thus as a sucker to draw\r\nonwards the vital juices towards the young fruit, it will act also as an\r\noutlet, to drain off what would otherwise be superabundant and dangerous\r\nto these tender organs of reproduction. After the flowers have expanded,\r\nthis danger does not exist to so great an extent, the infant fruit have\r\nnew and important functions to perform, which are peculiarly their own;\r\nand these call for a greater supply from the nutritive organs of the\r\nplant: the stopping of the branch therefore, is the means of throwing in\r\nthis increased supply of food; but those who can most fully appreciate the\r\ndelicacy of the functions performed by the plant at this stage of its\r\ndevelopement, will most fully value the suggestion not to stop back the\r\ngrowing branch _all at once_, but to do it by successional, though not\r\ndistant operations. The leaf which is directed to be left above, or beyond\r\neach fruit, will serve, both as a reservoir, to receive all the\r\nsuperabundant food, which may either be induced or impelled upwards; and\r\nalso, as a labaratory where this food will become purified and changed by\r\nits exposure to atmospheric influence, amongst the lax tissue; and whence,\r\nan appointed portion will be returned, and devoted by a process of\r\nassimilation, to aid in the extension of the plants.\r\n\r\nThis system of pruning, with reference both to the barren and the fruitful\r\nbranches, must be continued, whilst these continue in a vigorous and\r\nhealthy condition; but when any symptoms of decay or of expended powers,\r\nare perceived, they should be pruned quite away, and young ones encouraged\r\nin their stead. All the pruning which has been spoken of, except the\r\noccasional removal of a main shoot, should be done at a sufficiently early\r\nperiod of growth, to admit of being effected by means of the thumb-nail;\r\nfor like all other plants, Cucumbers are much best treated, when whatever\r\npruning they may require, is done at that stage of growth, when the least\r\namount of trouble and labour is required to perform it. Pruning is not\r\nunder any circumstances a natural process, and when we have recourse to it\r\nin artificial cultivation, it is only an expedient, which is rendered\r\nnecessary by the limited space, within which it becomes necessary to\r\nconfine the extension of the plants; and since this is the case, it is far\r\nbetter to remove a portion of any plant, at an early period of its\r\ngrowth, and thus to economize its vital energies, rather than to suffer\r\nthem to be expended, and the supply to become exhausted through a\r\nsuperfluous developement, and then to deprive it of those very organs, by\r\nthe action of which, the expenditure would be again recompensed to the\r\nvital energies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. V.\r\n\r\nON THE NATURE, AND COMPOSITION OF THE SOIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nPlants absorb fluids through the extremities or spongioles of the roots,\r\nand it is thus that those portions of the substances which serve them as\r\ntheir food, and are derived from the soil, are carried into their system,\r\nin a state of solution: these spongioles are not strictly to be regarded\r\nas analogous to the mouths of animals, for they are not provided with\r\nopenings, and cannot imbibe even the most impalpable powders; their action\r\nseems to be more analogous to that of the lacteals in animals, for these,\r\nas well as spongioles, serve to convey fluids only. These considerations\r\nrender it necessary, that in the composition of soil for the growth of\r\nplants, the following important points should be held in\r\nconsideration;--it should contain a sufficient ratio of organizable\r\nmatter, that is of substances which can be rendered available as food to\r\nthe plants; it should readily absorb fluids, since it is only when in a\r\nstate of solution, that food can enter into the structure of the plants;\r\nit should be sufficiently retentive to avoid the risk of injury by reason\r\nof the evaporation, which takes place to a very great extent, when too\r\ngreat an abundance of silica is present, or when more than a due degree of\r\nporosity exists in its mechanical texture; and it should be sufficiently\r\npermeable, to prevent any thing like excess of moisture, by stagnation.\r\n\r\nSoils composed either principally, or almost entirely of heath soil, or of\r\nvegetable mould, although very highly recommended for the growth of the\r\nCucumber in winter, are nevertheless objectionable when applied alone, as\r\nwill be evident if the foregoing principles are taken into view: it cannot\r\nhowever be assumed that the plants will not grow in these soils, for they\r\ngrow vigorously for a period; neither can it be asserted that such soils\r\ndo not contain the qualities which are necessary to administer to the\r\nnutrition of plants, for it is scarcely possible to conceive any\r\nsubstances which are more nutritious, or whose application in this respect\r\nis more effectual; but they are objectionable, in consequence of their\r\nbecoming soon expended, and failing to maintain for any length of time, an\r\nequable degree of moisture. The cause which tends to produce this effect,\r\nis the porosity, or the want of mechanical combination in the texture of\r\nthe soil; which being highly favourable to evaporation, is liable to\r\nrender it speedily, and very materially dry, when exposed to the influence\r\nof powerful solar heat: the frequent application of water, does not\r\nentirely obviate the objection, for even when so applied, it soon becomes\r\nagain evaporated, and thus tends to deteriorate the soil, and decrease its\r\nfertility; this it does, by taking up much of the soluble matter contained\r\nin it, and conveying it by evaporation into the atmosphere, instead of its\r\nbeing taken up by the roots whilst in a fluid state, and applied to the\r\nplant as a means of nutrition: when it is thus conveyed to the atmosphere,\r\nthe leaves though they are enabled to take up a portion of their food from\r\nthence, are still incapacitated to do so fully, and hence, much of the\r\nfertilizing properties of the soil, is carried off by the first current\r\nof air which passes through the structure; and the plants decline by\r\nreason of starvation, though they had been seated in the midst of plenty.\r\n\r\nThe soil which I should recommend for the growth of the Cucumber, would be\r\ncomposed of ingredients, capable of supplying a sufficient portion of\r\nvegetable food; of retaining a due portion of moisture, when placed under\r\npowerful evaporation; and of securing the free passage of water through\r\nits mass: the former of these conditions would be secured, by the use of\r\nmould from the decaying leaves of trees, in the proportion of about\r\nthree-eighths; the latter would be ensured, by employing about one-fourth\r\npart of turfy heath mould, and one-eighth part of clean coarse sand; and\r\nthe remaining quality, would result by combining these ingredients with\r\none-fourth part of good turfy loam. The preparation of this soil should\r\ntake place in the dry weather of the summer months, just previous to its\r\nbeing used, so that it can be frequently turned and mixed, without\r\nincurring the danger of reducing it to an adhesive consistency, which\r\nwould at once render it ungenial for the roots of plants: the turfy\r\nportions both of the loam and heath soil should be piled up reversely,\r\nuntil the herbage and roots of the grass, become partially decayed; when\r\nrequired for use, it should be chopped into pieces of from two to four\r\ninches square, by the spade, and then adding the other ingredients _in a\r\nrough state_, the whole should be well mixed, without sifting, or any\r\nother mechanical operation which would have the effect of destroying its\r\nopen texture. It should always be prevented from becoming saturated with\r\nwater; and moreover, should never be applied to the roots of plants which\r\nare growing in a warm medium, without having been previously submitted to\r\na high temperature, for a sufficient length of time, to have absorbed at\r\nleast an equal degree of heat, with that in which the plants might be\r\nalready growing.\r\n\r\nThe admixture of charcoal with the soil, is said to be a means of adding\r\nto its nutritive qualities. Charcoal, which is nearly pure carbon, may be\r\nsupposed continually to give off a portion of this gaseous substance\r\nduring its decomposition, and this uniting with a portion of the oxygen\r\ncontained in the air, would furnish a supply of carbonic acid gas, to the\r\natmosphere immediately about the plants. It should however be borne in\r\nmind, that charcoal, is a substance whose decomposition except under the\r\ninfluence of heat, proceeds very slowly indeed, and therefore its chemical\r\ninfluence must not be overrated: doubtless however, the small portion\r\nwhich does combine with the oxygen of the air, is directly beneficial to\r\nthe plants; for it is a function of the vegetable kingdom by the action of\r\ntheir leaves, when under the influence of light, to decompose carbonic\r\nacid, the oxygen of which is liberated, and the carbon fixed in the living\r\ntissue. It is therefore probable that a supply of carbonic acid,\r\nartificially maintained about the leaves and stems of plants, may be\r\nbeneficial to them, by furnishing them directly with a portion of carbon,\r\nwhich they cannot absorb in a seperate state. When the charcoal is made\r\nfrom twigs, and the small branches of trees, its decomposition is often\r\nmore rapid, than when it is obtained by the usual course of manufactering\r\nit: if the latter kind of charcoal is employed, it should be broken into\r\npieces of a small size; and in ordinary cases, it should not be used in\r\nlarger proportion than with about twice its bulk of soil, with which it\r\nshould be intimately blended.\r\n\r\nBesides its chemical action, which is probably beneficial, charcoal has a\r\ndecidedly advantageous mechanical action in the composition of soils, and\r\nthis is of a twofold nature:--first, in common with any similar\r\nmaterials, it renders the soil \"open,\" and thus effectually favours the\r\nfree passage of water through its mass: secondly, it serves as a perpetual\r\nreservoir of moisture in the soil, for in consequence of its being\r\nextremely porous, it imbibes a great quantity of water, by its force of\r\nattraction, and this it parts with slowly to the soil; in this way, there\r\nis no doubt that its action is most salutary. Probably a few pieces of\r\ncharcoal placed perpendicularly in the soil, and kept continually _wet_,\r\nby the action of some little capillary contrivance, would serve as the\r\nbest possible means of conducting moisture, and distributing it to the\r\nroots of plants.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the application of dung, in any way whatever, has\r\nnot been recommended; neither do I consider it to be at all requisite, or\r\ndesirable, in the culture of winter Cucumbers: luxuriance is not a\r\nconsummation which it is at all desirable to attain to, a moderate, well\r\nmatured growth, being far preferable; and as some care is supposed to be\r\nused to provide suitable soil, it should be of such a nature as to possess\r\nthe properties, which are requisite to effect the desired end. Dung\r\ncontaining as it does fertilizing properties, may do well to renew the\r\nfertility of exhausted soils, which may have been under a long course of\r\ncultivation; but it is questionable, whether it ought to be admissable to\r\nany extent in pot culture, or in the growth of forced plants, in\r\npreference to a supply of wholesome unexhausted natural soil.\r\n\r\nA very great objection to the use of dung when applied in a solid state in\r\nthe composition of soils, consists, in its being presented to the roots of\r\nplants, not only in the advanced periods of their existence, but equally\r\nso, during the early stages of their growth; here must be an error, for\r\ninfants, whether they belong to the animal or vegetable kingdom, are\r\ncertainly not capacitated to appropriate the same kind of food, in the\r\nsame proportion, as adults. If only a small portion of soil is at first\r\nemployed, and portions more and more enriched, are from time to time\r\nadded, as the roots may extend, we are still liable to stumble on an\r\nobjection, almost as important, though of a somewhat different nature; for\r\nwe can in that case scarcely fail to injure the spongioles of the roots in\r\na greater or less degree, and the injury thus sustained, will consequently\r\nact as a check in the progress of their developement. These considerations\r\nseem at once to mark the propriety of applying liquid manures in highly\r\nartificial cultivation; they can be supplied in this state, when the\r\nplants are in such a mature and advanced state of growth, as from time to\r\ntime to require their aid; and their fertilizing properties being held in\r\nsolution by the fluid medium in which they are conveyed, they are just in\r\nthe condition to be taken up at once by the rootlets. It must still\r\nhowever be recollected, that whilst even impalpable powders cannot as such\r\nbe made to minister to the nutrition of plants, so neither can gross\r\nliquids effect this purpose: it is clear limpid fluids, only, which can be\r\nreceived by the delicate spongioles, and therefore the so-called manure\r\nwater, when applied of the consistency of mud, is not only in an unfit\r\nstate to effect its purpose, except by the addition of a more bountiful\r\nsupply of pure liquid, but it is also liable to act injuriously by reason\r\nof the concentration of the strength or powerful qualities of the manure,\r\nand by counteracting the open texture of the soil. Manure water,\r\ntherefore, from whatever source it may be derived, though not necessarily\r\na colourless, should without question, be a limpid fluid; if otherwise\r\napplied, it will at once destroy one of the best qualities a soil can\r\npossess, viz. porosity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VI.\r\n\r\nON THE APPLICATION OF MOISTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom what has been stated in the preceeding chapter, it will be\r\nsufficiently evident, that a supply of water is required as a component of\r\nthe soil, in which all plants are grown, in order to enable them to draw\r\nfrom it, other components, which form their food; and that, as it is\r\nnecessary for them continually to take up a portion of this food, so is it\r\nnecessary, that moisture should be continually present, in order to render\r\nit available by them.\r\n\r\nAmong other conditions to which the operation of applying water to the\r\nsoil should be subjected, there are some which are specially important: it\r\nshould never be either applied in _excess_, or unduly withheld; nor should\r\nit ever be applied when of a temperature below that of the atmosphere in\r\nwhich the plants to whose roots it is applied, are growing at the time of\r\nits application.\r\n\r\nThere is a liability of applying water in excess, when the particular\r\nstage of growth, the peculiar state of the weather, or the season of the\r\nyear, are not duly regarded: thus, an adult plant will consume more water\r\nthan an infant plant; and any plant, will decompose a larger quantity of\r\nwater, in sunny weather, when evaporation is going on briskly, than in\r\ncloudy weather, when it is scarcely perceptible; again, in the summer\r\nseason, a much larger quantity will be appropriated, than in the winter.\r\nWater has been applied in excess, whenever the soil becomes soddened or\r\nsaturated therewith; but great as this evil is, it is equalled in its\r\ninjurious effects, by falling into the opposite extreme, and withholding a\r\nquantity sufficient to render the constituents of the soil, available as\r\nfood to the roots of plants placed in it.\r\n\r\nThe necessity of applying water, of a temperature equal to that of the\r\nsoil, is rendered evident by a reference to the natural conditions by\r\nwhich the soil is watered. In a small and nearly globular form, the water\r\ngathered up by the action of the sun, and forming the clouds above us, is\r\nprecipitated through the atmosphere, and there its temperature becomes\r\nequalized or assimilated with that of the medium through which it has been\r\npassing; and although in our own latitude, we perhaps fail to discover any\r\nmaterial degree of warmth in the drops of rain as they fall, yet in\r\neastern climes, we cannot but imagine, that after having been submitted in\r\nthe thin strata of the clouds to the action of the sun, they must\r\npreviously to entering the soil, have imbibed some portion of heat.\r\nMoreover, the importance of maintaining a gentle bottom heat, at the roots\r\nof forced plants, renders it necessary to avoid any application, which may\r\ntend to lesson its effect, and submit the roots to any chilling influence.\r\nThe temperature of the soil is naturally above that of the atmosphere, and\r\nas the application of moisture by exciting evaporation, has an abstract\r\ntendency to lower the temperature, it should therefore, when applied, be\r\nin a slight degree warmed, so as thus to increase rather than diminish the\r\nheat contained in the soil.\r\n\r\nAs some moisture in the soil is necessary to render the food contained\r\ntherein, soluble, and available to the spongioles of the roots, so\r\nmoisture in the atmosphere is essentially necessary to assist in applying\r\nthe gaseous elements of that elastic compound fluid, to the nutrition of\r\nplants by the action of the leaves: without moisture in the atmosphere,\r\nthe leaves and outer covering of plants would become dessicated, and the\r\nstomatas shrivelled up and closed, so that neither the exhaling nor the\r\nimbibing functions of the plants could then be carried on.\r\n\r\nThe moisture of the atmosphere, then must not be neglected; not only\r\nbecause the healthy action of the vital organs of the plants depends on a\r\nproper hygrometrical state of the atmosphere, but, inasmuch as it is the\r\nreadiest means both of avoiding, and when unhappily, they are present, of\r\ndestroying, many of the most destructive and troublesome insect enemies,\r\nto whose depredations, plants are subject.\r\n\r\nWhen a moist atmosphere is duly and regularly maintained, there is but\r\nlittle fear need be entertained of the establishment of a colony of\r\ninsects--such as the thrip, and the red spider, which are perhaps the\r\ngreatest pests which have to be overcome in the forcing house; nor is\r\nthere a more effectual method of destroying them, than by applying a high\r\ntemperature in conjunction with an intense degree of moisture. To the want\r\nof a balance of moisture in the composition of the atmosphere, and in the\r\nsoil, too, rather than as is commonly supposed, to an excess of it in the\r\nformer, is the appearance called mildew to be attributed; this it\r\noccasions by checking the regular action of the perspiratory organs, and\r\nthereby inducing an eruption of the cells of the tissue: the extravasated\r\nsap lodging on the cuticle, affords a nidus for the germination of the\r\nsporules of that particular fungus, which when grown, is the mildew: the\r\nremedy consists in avoiding an irregular composition of the atmosphere, as\r\nregards heat and moisture; and also an excess or deficiency of moisture in\r\nthe soil, so that each may be in a condition to exert its proper influence\r\non the constitution and developement of the plants. Canker, another\r\ndisease, to which Cucumbers are sometimes subject, appears to be produced\r\nby too low a degree of temperature, accompanied by an excess of moisture,\r\nboth in the soil and the atmosphere, and it generally attacks those\r\nparticular parts, where any check or obstruction is offered to the flow of\r\nthe sap, such as that occasioned by a wound, or even the ramifications of\r\nthe stem: this suggests that its remedy, would consist in a due regulation\r\nand balance of the constituents of the atmosphere, and the soil.\r\n\r\nMoisture is generally applied to the soil by being poured directly on it,\r\nand to the atmosphere, by means of the syringe, and the use of evaporation\r\ntroughs. When applied to the soil only from the upper surface, there is a\r\nliability of its failing thoroughly to moisten it, and by reason of this,\r\ntogether with the constant action of the heat from below, by whatever\r\nmeans heat may be applied, the soil is frequently found to be dry beneath,\r\nwhen the appearance of the surface might lead to the supposition that it\r\nwas sufficiently moistened.\r\n\r\nBy a reference to the sketch and description already given, it will be\r\nseen, that a provision is there made, whereby water can be poured in\r\nquantity _beneath the soil_, immediately on the top of the tank, whence in\r\nthe form of vapour it will rise among the soil, and thus render it\r\nthoroughly moist; at the same time, it can be applied to the surface,\r\nwhenever it may become necessary to do so. The moistening of the\r\natmosphere will also be fully secured by the mode of ventilation which is\r\nthere proposed, for the air, at the same time that it is warmed, will\r\nbecome charged with moisture in a ratio equal to its temperature, before\r\nit enters the house. If it becomes requisite to admit moisture without\r\nchanging the volume of air, it can readily be effected by opening the\r\ntubes or shafts inside the house, without opening the exterior\r\nventilators; and when dry heat may be required, it can be secured by\r\nclosing entirely the communication with this reservoir of moisture, and\r\nthe hot-water pipes will then radiate any quantity of dry heat that may be\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nBy means of a due application of these provisions, an equable degree of\r\nmoisture beneath and among the soil, as well as in the composition of the\r\natmosphere, can be secured with perfect ease, and a trifling amount of\r\nlabour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VII.\r\n\r\nON THE REGULATION OF THE TEMPERATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we figure to our minds, a plant which in its native habitat enjoys a\r\nclimate far more genial, and a temperature far more elevated, than our own\r\ncountry affords, it must be obvious that some regulation, and increase of\r\ntemperature, either positively, by the artificial application of heat, or\r\nnegatively, by affording shelter and protection, will be required in order\r\nto ensure any degree of success in its cultivation. The Cucumber is a\r\nreputed native of the East, and we have therefore in this supposed fact,\r\nan indication of the nature of the climate, which it should be our object\r\nto provide for it; but still it must be borne in mind, that in conducting\r\nany system of artificial cultivation, it is not at all times desirable, or\r\neven safe, to supply a resemblance to any part of the natural\r\ncircumstances affecting the growth of a particular plant, unless we have\r\nthe means of supplying the _greater part_, or _all_ the conditions which\r\nexist in a state of nature: this I shall again have occasion to refer to.\r\n\r\nBy another step we arrive at the conclusion that the standard of\r\ntemperature, to which the Cucumber is submitted in its cultivation in this\r\ncountry, is a point, varying with the individual opinion of cultivators;\r\nas some may take a part of the natural conditions of growth as their rule;\r\nothers, all these circumstances; and others, again, various combinations\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nReferring back again to the provisions of nature, we can scarcely hesitate\r\nto conclude, that in clear sunny weather, the temperature to which the\r\nCucumber is submitted, _cannot within reasonable limits_, be permitted to\r\nrise too high; whilst at other times, when the weather is dull, or cloudy,\r\nand always at night, a much lower degree of heat ought to be applied. In\r\nsunny weather, the natural agents which cause excitement and activity of\r\nthe vital functions, are in full action; and consequently at such periods\r\nwe may rationally indulge in the application of those exciting agents\r\nwhich are under our controul--always however bearing in mind, that we must\r\nnot unduly apply one agent, when we either cannot, or neglect to apply the\r\nothers also. On the other hand, in dull weather, and at night, the source\r\nof light being in the one case absent, in the other obscured, a\r\ncomparative state of lethargy or repose is prevalent, and the natural\r\nfunctions of vitality are but feeble in their action, if not in some\r\ncases, absolutely in a quiescent state; with such a state of things\r\nexisting, it is barely rational to apply stimulants, and to induce\r\nunnatural excitement. The application of exciting and stimulating agents\r\nat such periods, may be compared in its effects to the excitement of a\r\nfrightful dream acting on the human frame; the vital functions--not the\r\nvitality itself--cease during sleep, and both the animal and the vegetable\r\nshould be at rest; excitement acts on both by deranging the system, at\r\nleast for a time, and since a succession of these derangements are known\r\nto produce injurious results, we may be certain, that each seperate\r\ninstance must have an evil tendency.\r\n\r\nIn applying this practically, to the case before us, it may be\r\nrecommended, that the temperature in which Cucumbers are grown during\r\nwinter, should not fall much below 60° Fahrenheit, at night; and in the\r\nday time it should not rise above 70° in dull weather, by the aid of heat\r\nartificially applied; in clear weather, by the influence of that glorious\r\nsource of light and heat, the sun, it may be safely allowed to rise to\r\n80°, or a little higher, before air is admitted. A somewhat higher range\r\nmay be permitted, as the days lengthen, and the influence of the sun\r\nbecomes more powerful; thus at night, it should not rise over 65°, by day\r\n75° to 80°, and by sun heat to 90°. Thus it will be seen, that I have\r\nrecommended the regulation of the temperature of the internal atmosphere,\r\nby that which is external; and it is my firm conviction that inattention\r\nto this simple rule, is the source of much of the failure, which is\r\nexperienced by some of those who attempt the growth of plants, at any\r\nother than that, which may be regarded as their natural season of growth.\r\nIt appears to me, most unreasonable, to aim at attaining any particular\r\npoint of the thermometer, merely because any particular season of the year\r\nmay be present, or any particular stage of growth attained. Even if in the\r\nsunny climes, from whence the Cucumber has been transmitted to us, there\r\nexists such an equality of temperature and atmospheric serenity, as some\r\ncultivators attempt in the growth of these plants; it surely cannot be\r\nconsistent in us to equalize and elevate the temperature of our artificial\r\natmospheres, when we cannot supply them at the same time with the same\r\nintensity of light, or provide for them the same serene and unclouded sky.\r\nIt should rather be our object to adapt the plant to the climate of our\r\ncountry, since we cannot change the climate to supply the natural\r\ncircumstances, with which the plant is favoured; and acting on this\r\nprinciple, we should never aim at supplying the agents which would induce\r\na premature and therefore debilitated developement, when the whistling\r\nwind, and the drifting snow, tell us that Nature, would have, at least the\r\nmembers of her vegetable kingdom, be at rest.\r\n\r\nSince however, it is apparent that during the depth of the winter season,\r\nat least when wintry weather is present, the progress of plants in an\r\nartificially heated atmosphere, ought not to be rapid, or unduly forced;\r\nit by no means follows that no progression at all should be made: the\r\nelements of growth maybe supplied; but the application of them should be\r\nguided by moderation, being lessened at those particular periods when the\r\nweather is least propitious, and increased during those periods when it is\r\nmost favourable. In the works of Nature we may ever learn a lesson of\r\nconsistency, for they are perfect: they teach us that food is requisite to\r\nmaintain the life of all those objects which are endowed with it; that\r\nthat food must undergo a process both of digestion and assimilation, ere\r\nits purpose is fulfilled; and that each of these processes depend on the\r\naction of natural agents. In the vegetable kingdom, heat and fight as\r\nderived from a united source, are the agents appointed to bring about\r\nthese results, and in order to ensure their proper action, they must both\r\nbe present in a powerful degree: in artificial schemes of culture, we can\r\ncommand a supply of the one, but the other is not within our power; our\r\nconsistency therefore depends on our applying so much of the one under our\r\ncontroul, as will secure the united action of it, with the existing degree\r\nof the other--consequently, _when light is absent, or deficient, heat\r\nshould also be diminished; and when light is present and abundant, heat\r\nmay safely be increased_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. VIII.\r\n\r\nON THE ADMISSION OF AIR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of the admission of air, is one of some importance. It is an\r\nopinion, which was I believe first publicly brought forward by the late\r\nMr. Knight, that an influx of a large volume of the external atmosphere,\r\nto the interior of forcing houses, is by no means requisite, and is often\r\nthe source of very serious evils. Were it for no other reason, than that\r\nof avoiding the chilling influence of cold air on the tender tissue of\r\nplants growing in a high temperature, I should feel inclined to support\r\nsuch a view; but when there are facts sufficiently abundant, to prove,\r\nthat plants do not themselves vitiate the air of such structures to an\r\nextent sufficient to render it unfit for their continued growth, or at\r\nleast, that a sufficient interchange is constantly going on, without\r\nopening the sashes of a forcing house, the evidence appears to be\r\noverwhelming; and the necessity of continuing a practice so fraught with\r\ndanger, and so frequently attended with disappointment, appears to be done\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe injury done to the tender foliage of plants in forcing houses, by\r\ncontact with cold air, results from the increased capacity of air for\r\nmoisture, as it become heated. When cold air is admitted to these\r\nstructures, it cannot contain so great a quantity of aqueous matter, as it\r\nis capable of taking up when it becomes warmed: this increase of\r\ntemperature, is soon in great measure, supplied to it, but rarely is a\r\nsufficient quantity of moisture, at the same time within its reach, to\r\nenable it to supply its increased capacity for aqueous matter: the\r\nconsequence is, that on coming in contact with the foilage of the plants,\r\nwhich is of a succulent nature, and contains a great proportion of water,\r\nthe warmed air continues to abstract a portion of moisture from the\r\nplants, until its capacity is satisfied; and hence the plants are robbed\r\nof their \"life's blood.\" Besides this action, which is the cause of\r\nserious evil, the tissue itself is contracted and thereby injured, by\r\nreason of the degree of cold, which is at the first gush, liable to come\r\nin contact with the warm foliage. These remarks apply to cold air, when\r\nadmitted in a large bulk, by opening the sashes; and when a draught is\r\nproduced, by opening them, both at the back and front, and the top and\r\nbottom of the house.\r\n\r\nDeterioration of the air, by the action of the functions of the plants,\r\ncould not take place, except in hermetically sealed structures: for by\r\nreason of the expansibility and elasticity of air, when it becomes at all\r\nheated, it not only gains egress, but also admission through the most\r\nminute crevices: that this interchange is sufficient to counteract any\r\ndeteriorating influence which the plants might have on the internal air,\r\nwith respect to their continued existence in it, is abundantly proved by\r\nthe growth of plants in Ward's cases, from the interior of which the\r\nexternal air is excluded as fully as it possibly can be, without their\r\nbeing actually sealed: if therefore, any injurious effects result to\r\nplants, from their being cultivated in a close atmosphere, we must seek\r\nfor the cause, in some other source, than the plants themselves. If any\r\nnoxious qualities exist in the atmosphere of structures, to which the\r\nexternal air has not free ingress, they must result from some neglect or\r\nignorance on our part, in suffering extraneous and unwholesome matters to\r\naccumulate in such situations, and there to decompose, and enter into\r\ncombination with those gaseous bodies, which form the volume of the\r\ninternal atmosphere of our plant structures. The existence of such\r\nextraneous matters, may indeed be traced to various sources; and they may\r\nbe present, even when much vigilance is employed to prevent their\r\naccumulation; and therefore, as an inconceivably minute quantity,\r\ninappreciable to the senses, would frequently be sufficient to effect\r\ndeterioration, it is possible that these impurities may often originate in\r\nsources which are least of all suspected. The decomposition of organic\r\nmatter, whether animal or vegetable, may frequently be the source of\r\ninjurious results in this respect; for although this is principally\r\nresolved into those elementary gases, which appear to form the basis of\r\nall created objects, yet there are other matters liberated, which may then\r\nenter into fresh combinations; and either this, or a disproportionate\r\naccumulation, even of these elementary bodies, may reasonably give rise to\r\nserious apprehension, and demand the exercise of discretion, in order to\r\nprevent them from becoming injurious. Besides this, these decomposing\r\nbodies, afford just the very state of things, which appears to be\r\nrequisite to call into existence, and developement, a numerous phalanx of\r\ncryptogamic vegetables: not that such matters, can for a moment be\r\nrationally considered to generate, these _cellulares_; but that they\r\nafford a suitable pabulum, and medium of developement for those millions\r\nupon millions of sporules, which we may readily conceive to be dispersed\r\nin the atmosphere; and with which it may be teeming, though from their\r\nbuoyancy and minuteness, they may float to us invisibly therein.\r\n\r\nThe admission of the external air, by the ordinary process of opening the\r\nsashes of forcing houses, has been said to be unnecessary, or at least by\r\nno means important, in so far as the function of vegetable respiration is\r\nconcerned, because the buoyancy of the air within all such structures,\r\nwould enable it to escape in sufficient quantity through their openings\r\nand crevices, to counterbalance any thing like deterioration, which might\r\nby any means result from the vital action of the plant. The admission of\r\nexternal air, is also directly injurious to forced plants, during the\r\nwinter and spring months, when a very material difference of temperature\r\nexists between it, and the internal volume, by contracting the vessels,\r\nimpeding the circulation of the juices, and thereby checking the regular\r\ncourse of the growth of the plant. If these reasons fail to stamp it as a\r\npractice which ought not largely to be indulged in, it is further\r\nobjectionable, as being productive of a prodigal expenditure of fuel:\r\nthere can be little doubt but that generally speaking, a far greater\r\nquantity of fuel than is requisite, is expended in maintaining the\r\ntemperature of forcing houses, solely from this cause; for the cold air\r\nwhen admitted, continues to abstract a portion of heat from the warmed\r\nair, until the temperature of both becomes equal, and consequently an\r\nincreased application of fuel is requisite, in order to raise the newly\r\nadmitted air to the same temperature as that which has been suffered to\r\nescape; and as the buoyancy of heated air is so great, an immense volume\r\nmust necessarily rush out through a very small aperture, and thus there\r\nmust also of necessity be an immense waste both of heat, and of fuel. A\r\ngiven portion of fuel, in its combustion, can give off but a certain\r\nproportionate ratio of heat, and if this is allowed unnecessarily to\r\nescape, the prodigality is self-evident. It is but a weak argument, which\r\nwould seek to give to the admission of cold air, the office of regulating\r\nthe temperature of plant houses; this ought to be effected by limiting the\r\ndegree of heat _applied_, and not by attending to the _abstraction_ of\r\nthat which had been previously administered with two lavish an hand.\r\nBesides the extravagance of such a course, the constitutional vigour and\r\nenergy of the plants is at the same time sacrificed by undue excitement.\r\nThe admission of cold air in large quantities, therefore, brings\r\ncondemnation in its train, since it is unnecessary, and extravagant, as\r\nwell as directly injurious.\r\n\r\nThere are nevertheless some considerations which render the admission of\r\nair, when regulated and applied with discretion, an operation of\r\nimportance to the health of plants: it is productive of beneficial\r\neffects in carrying off the noxious vapours, which may although unseen,\r\nand guarded against, still float in the atmosphere; and there can be\r\nlittle doubt that another beneficial influence which it exercises, results\r\nfrom the motion which is produced by a body of air changing its position,\r\nwhich probably promotes circulation, and increases the excitability of the\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nSince therefore a change of the volume of the atmosphere in plant houses,\r\nis productive of benefit, and the admission of a large body of cold air,\r\nis at the same time so decidedly objectionable, it is important, that in\r\nendeavouring to secure the benefits of the practice, the injuries which\r\nare liable to result, should if possible be avoided. The regulation for\r\nthe admistion of air, which is described in the second chapter of this\r\ntreatise, may be regarded as being of some importance in this respect, as\r\nwell as in the provision which it includes, of supplying the heated air,\r\nwith a due proportion of moisture.\r\n\r\nPhysiologists tell us, that plants derive a considerable proportion of\r\ntheir food, directly from the atmosphere, by a process similar to the\r\ninhaling of animals; and that the substances thus derived, are carbonic\r\nacid, ammonia, and water, which contain the elements of organic matter in\r\nconsiderable proportions. The influence of the atmosphere is exerted\r\nbeneficially, by its constituents entering into combinations with other\r\nmatters, which are taken into the system by the roots, and spread out and\r\nexposed in the leaves: this exposure has so far the effect of altering the\r\ncharacter of the substance carried up from the roots, that it is no longer\r\na body of crude juice, but is undergoing a process of elaboration, and is\r\nbeing assimilated with the superincumbent tissue of the plant. There seems\r\nto be no reason why those particular gaseous bodies which plants\r\nappropriate to themselves from the atmosphere, should not to a great\r\nextent be supplied to them artificially, at such periods as it may be\r\nnecessary, or desirable, to accelerate their growth, and induce a more\r\nperfect and mature developement. It has been already stated, that the most\r\nimportant of these aeriform bodies, are nitrogen, which plants derive from\r\nammonia; and carbon, which they derive from carbonic acid gas, on the\r\nliberation of the oxygen, which is one of its constituents; neither of\r\nthese, can however be appropriated, when in a free state, but only when in\r\na state of combination, and forming either a gaseous or a fluid body. It\r\nis probable that nitrogen might be supplied to plants, through the medium\r\nof the atmosphere in an artificial manner, by placing within any\r\nstructure, a portion of some of the volatile salts of ammonia, which\r\nlatter being given off, would at once supply the demands of vegetation.\r\nCarbon might be applied, by the use of charcoal; and it is worthy of\r\nexperiment how far the _combustion of charcoal_, in plant structures, by\r\naccelerating the formation of carbonic acid gas, may have a beneficial\r\ninfluence on vegetation. The use of charcoal as an ingredient in the soil,\r\nthough doubtless partly, and perhaps principally mechanical, is\r\nnevertheless in all probability rendered advantageous in this very way;\r\nthe slowness of its decomposition must however render the quantity\r\napplied, very homoeopathic in its nature.\r\n\r\nA series of experiments with the view of ascertaining the practicability\r\nof continually supplying to the atmosphere, those qualities which plants\r\nabstract from it, and of determining the manner, and the degree in which\r\nthey should be applied, would be one of the most interesting and important\r\nmatters, to which the minds of Horticultural reformers could possibly be\r\ndirected; but it is most essential, to remember, at the same time, \"that\r\nthese are powerful agents, requiring much skill in their adaptation,\" and\r\ncapable of effecting serious injury and disappointment, if\r\nindiscriminately applied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. IX.\r\n\r\nON THE GROWTH OF MELONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is barely possible to suppose any use to which a structure which during\r\nthe winter season had been devoted to the growth of Cucumbers, could be so\r\nlegitimately appropriated in the summer, as that of the growth of the\r\nfiner Melons of Persia, Cashmere, and the East. The superiority of such as\r\nthese, in every point of view, over those kinds, which have been long in\r\ncultivation, would be an ample recompense for the appropriation of such\r\nvaluable space to their use; whilst in no other structure could the\r\npeculiarities of the treatment they require, be so fully complied with,\r\nand be rendered so completely under control, as in that under\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nThere are some peculiarities in the treatment of these Melons, to the\r\nconsideration of which, it may be desirable to devote a brief space; the\r\nmost important of these, are the composition of the soil, the application\r\nof moisture at the root, the regulation of atmospheric warmth, and also,\r\nof atmospheric moisture; in these particulars, they offer some differences\r\nto what has been previously stated, with reference to the Cucumber.\r\n\r\nThe soil in which the Melon delights to grow, is one of a more compact\r\ntexture than is usually regarded as applicable for the Cucumber: a\r\nsuitable compost consists of the \"top spit\" from a loamy pasture, of a\r\ntexture _rather adhesive_, and retaining the herbage and roots of the\r\ngrass; this should be collected a few months before it is used, so that\r\nthese vegetable substances may be in a _decaying_ state, and it should be\r\nbroken roughly to pieces, but by no means sifted; to it, should be added,\r\nabout one-fourth part of vegetable mould: the whole should be well\r\nincorporated, and, before using, should be placed in a situation where it\r\nmay not be liable to become saturated by heavy rain; which would serve to\r\ndestroy the free and open texture, which it is so desirable to retain.\r\n\r\nIn the application of moisture to the soil, the structure which is\r\ndescribed in a previous chapter, will be found to present facilities,\r\nwhich peculiarly adapt it for the growth of these plants. In Persia, and\r\nthe neighbouring countries, where the Melon is so successfully grown, the\r\nground is irrigated by means of numerous channels, which, from the\r\nlimitation of their exposed surface, are not peculiarly adapted to supply\r\natmospheric moisture; but are yet sufficiently numerous to secure the\r\nperfect irrigation of the soil, within the reach of the roots. The tubes\r\nor shafts, represented at (_n_) in the sketch referred to above, are\r\nintended to communicate directly with a layer of coarse open material,\r\nextending entirely over the top of the tank, and beneath the soil; by\r\nmeans of these a supply of water should be poured beneath the soil, which\r\nwill thus keep that portion immediately about the young roots, in a\r\nconstant and complete state of saturation, by means of the steam which\r\nwill arise, in consequence of the heat from the tank. A uniformly warm,\r\nand a thoroughly moist soil, will be thus easily secured, which are two\r\nimportant points in the growth of Persian Melons. It must be recollected\r\nthat these conditions for supplying moisture, are recommended only during\r\nthe time of growing the plants, and swelling the fruit; but as these\r\nlatter approach their maturity, the degree of moisture must of course be\r\ngradually diminished.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this moistened and genial soil, the Melon has\r\nnaturally the advantage also, of powerful sun heat, and intense light; and\r\nthese are two conditions which it is indispensable should be supplied in\r\nartificial cultivation, as fully as they can possibly be obtained. It is\r\nby means of the moisture of the soil, that the plants are enabled to grow\r\non rapidly and vigorously, because that moisture renders the food\r\ncontained in the soil, soluble, and therefore available to the roots; but\r\nthe elaboration and assimilation of this food depends on the degree of\r\n_light_ and _heat_ with which they are supplied: without these conditions,\r\nto convert the crude sap, by their united agency, into organic compounds,\r\nsuch as lignin, gum, starch, and sugar, and to induce their deposition,\r\nthe fruit will indeed be formed--it will grow, and perhaps may even tempt\r\nthe eye; but unless these chemical and vital changes have taken place in\r\nits constituent parts, the eye, as it frequently happens, will have been\r\ndeceived; and instead of the palate being gratified by a mature and\r\nluscious fruit, it will find nothing but a tasteless mass of pulp. The\r\nplants, therefore, cannot, in our latitude, receive too intense a degree\r\nof solar heat, or of light.\r\n\r\nThe same cause which renders the natural atmosphere of the Melon countries\r\nelevated in temperature, renders it also comparatively dry; the sun drinks\r\nup the moisture which is deposited near the surface, or which may rise to\r\nthat position; and by an exceedingly powerful influence effectually\r\nprevents the accumulation of moisture about the exposed parts of the\r\nplants. The atmosphere is nevertheless not in an arid state; the\r\nevaporation from a well-moistened soil effectually prevents this from\r\nbeing the case, but the excessive heat also as effectually and continually\r\nprevents an undue accumulation of moisture in the atmosphere. The\r\napplication of this fact, to artificial practice, is plain; a less amount\r\nof moisture artificially applied, in comparison with the temperature, must\r\nbe permitted, than when the cultivation of those plants is attempted whose\r\nnatural habitats are less strongly featured in this respect.\r\n\r\nSuch considerations as these naturally force on us the conclusion, that it\r\nis vain to attempt the cultivation of this noble fruit, except during that\r\nportion of the year when the sun exerts his greatest power in our\r\nlatitude. It is not because they cannot be induced to grow at any other\r\nperiod of the year, for the mere extension of vegetable tissue will go on,\r\nthough the influence of the natural agents is but limited and feeble; but\r\nit is because maturity, perfect development, and, above all, the full\r\nassimilation of the sap, cannot take place sufficiently to ensure a good\r\nflavour in the fruit, except light and heat are not only unimpeded and\r\nconstant, but powerful and united in their action.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAP. X.\r\n\r\nCONCLUDING REMARKS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI will here briefly recall attention to a most important point which the\r\ncultivator should continually keep in view: it is most important that he\r\nshould _study Nature_; for if we may believe our senses, or place any\r\nconfidence in overwhelming evidence, we may be certain that all the\r\nconditions we observe in a natural state of things, have been planned by\r\nan All-wise hand; and further, that a finite mind can never attempt with\r\nsuccess, either to surpass or to dispense with any portion of that which\r\nan infinite being has ordained. \"Order is Heaven's first law,\" and in\r\nwhatever we may attempt to do, we shall not be wise, if we endeavour to\r\neffect our purpose by any means which may distort the fair proportions\r\nwhich unaided nature presents to our view. In cultivating plants,\r\ntherefore, we should administer the conditions which are favourable to\r\ntheir growth and development, in somewhat the same proportions each to the\r\nother, in which they are naturally blended--not supplying one essential,\r\nin an undue manner, and, at the same time, neglecting others; for\r\nsuccessful cultivation must ever depend upon the connection and influence\r\nof numerous circumstances upon each other, and can never be attained,\r\nunless these conditions are complied with, either designedly, or, as it\r\noften happens, by mere accident.\r\n\r\nAnother point which it is important to keep in view, is that instructions\r\nshould be studied, rather than copied, in their application to practice.\r\nNo instructions can be given that should be blindly and implicitly\r\nfollowed. The circumstances under which plants are placed are varying\r\nevery day, and even every hour, and, to be successful, horticultural\r\npractice must be varied also. It must, however, be varied according to\r\nprinciple. But even what are regarded as established laws and principles\r\nshould not be heedlessly followed; to be truly successful, a man must not\r\nonly be a practical enthusiast and a keen theorist; he must also be a\r\nskilful experimentalist: his experiments and their results, if carefully\r\nwatched, deduced, recorded, and studied, will serve to guide him for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On Heating, Ventilating or Aerating, and Covering._\r\n\r\nSince the publication of the first edition of this work in 1844, the views\r\nexpressed in the second chapter, with reference to structures best adapted\r\nfor Cucumber culture in the winter season, have met with much\r\ncorroborative support. Respecting the questions of heating, ventilation,\r\nand covering, a few more words may be added.\r\n\r\nI have before recommended hot water tanks for supplying bottom heat, with\r\nattached pipes for the circulation of hot water to warm the atmosphere. I\r\ncan see no reason for recommending any other arrangement now; for the\r\nexperience of successive years goes to show that hot water, applied on\r\nsound principles, is, above all other means of heating, effective in its\r\noperation; and as to the question of expense, raised as an objection to it\r\nby some, it is sufficient to say, that, although one hot water apparatus\r\nmay be fitted up in an expensive manner, another may be rendered perfectly\r\nsuccessful in its operation, at the same time that it is extremely simple\r\nin its arrangements, and correspondingly inexpensive in its cost.\r\n\r\nA seeming error in the engraving, at p. 18, has been pointed out to me. In\r\nthe description of the sketch it is stated that, \"a series of pipes\r\nattached to the same boiler [which heats the tank] would supply the\r\nrequisite heat to the atmosphere.\" The sketch itself shows these pipes to\r\nbe considerably above the level of the water in the tank, and where they\r\ncould not, consistently with the other arrangements, be thus employed.\r\nThis may be explained thus:--the sketch was introduced rather for the\r\npurpose of illustrating certain proposed arrangements, as regards bottom\r\nheat and ventilation, than as furnishing an exact and detailed design for\r\na model structure; and thus it happened that the pipes were merely shown\r\nto be placed at the front part of the house, to indicate that this was\r\ntheir proper relative position. There would be no practical difficulty in\r\nplacing the pipes lower down, and nearly close to the front wall, so as to\r\nadmit of the proposed connection; all that would be required to effect\r\nthis, being to fix the slab, on which they rest--and which prevents the\r\nair from rushing upwards into the atmosphere of the house at this\r\npoint--in a sloping position, instead of a horizontal one.\r\n\r\nThe principle involved in the plan proposed for aëration or ventilation,\r\nis no doubt a sound one; and though the plan which is more particularly\r\ndescribed may be modified and varied, yet it is believed to be efficient\r\nfor its intended purpose.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that the admission of cold air to a structure in\r\nwhich tender plants are being forced, either during winter or early\r\nspring, is materially hurtful to the plants, in proportion to the\r\ntenderness of their constitution; and the Cucumber being, under those\r\ncircumstances, a plant of a very tender and delicate nature, is especially\r\nsusceptible of harm from this source. As a consequence resulting from this\r\nfact, there can be little hesitation in affirming that whatever fresh or\r\nexternal air it may be necessary to admit, during the period referred to,\r\nshould be warmed before it reaches the plants, and in being warmed not\r\nburned, but supplied with the additional moisture its increased heat\r\ncapacitates it to take up, and which, to be congenial to vegetation, it\r\nrequires. This is provided for by the plan already recommended, where the\r\ncold air is made to pass through the tank containing the heated water\r\nwhich warms the soil. By a perfectly practicable modification of this\r\narrangement, not only may this result be secured, but also the continual\r\ncirculation of the internal atmosphere may at pleasure be assisted and\r\naccelerated, during the time when it might not be necessary to admit fresh\r\nair. This would be an additional advantage. The arrangement proposed to\r\neffect this, is to conduct the cold external air through a heated chamber\r\ncontaining the tanks--these latter being covered, but also admitting of\r\nbeing opened to any extent to supply moisture or steam in the proportion\r\nrequired. The cold air, after passing upwards through the chamber, escapes\r\nat the front of the house, and ascends to the upper part of the house,\r\nfrom whence it finds its way downwards near the back wall, and there again\r\nenters the chamber, through openings provided for the purpose. The\r\ncirculation of the internal atmosphere would be thus facilitated and\r\naccelerated, even without the admission of any current of external air,\r\nfor, of course, there is more or less of this kind of movement going on in\r\nthe atmosphere, wherever and in whatever form a source of artificial heat\r\nis present. Another mode of combining internal atmospheric motion, with\r\nventilation, and by which the cold air is warmed before it reaches the\r\nplants, has been practised with very marked success, in a vinery at\r\nPark-hill, Streatham, Surrey; and I have described it in the _Journal of\r\nthe Horticultural Society_[1] as follows:--\"This plan consists in passing\r\na zinc pipe, thickly perforated with small holes, from end to end of the\r\nvinery, and exactly beneath the range of hot water pipes, which heat the\r\nstructure. In the outer [end] wall, communicating with this perforated\r\npipe by means of a kind of broad funnel, a register valve is fixed, by\r\nwhich the admission of air can be regulated with the utmost nicety, or the\r\nsupply be shut off altogether: this valve is fixed a little below the\r\nlevel of the perforated pipe. The action of this contrivance was evident\r\nenough from the motion communicated to the foliage of the vines; and its\r\neffects were apparent in the unusually healthy and vigorous appearance\r\nthey bore, until their period of ripening. In this case, sufficient\r\nmoisture was kept up by syringing the walls and pipes, wetting the\r\npathway, and by the use of evaporating troughs, placed on the metal pipes,\r\nand kept constantly filled with water.\"\r\n\r\nIn another communication published in the work already quoted,[2] after\r\nalluding to the now well-known garden truism, that a comparatively low\r\nnight temperature is indispensable to the maintenance of vigorous growth\r\nin plants of all kinds, I have advocated a more extended adoption of the\r\npractice of night covering hot houses, as a means of permitting the low\r\nnight temperature required, and at the same time securing the plants\r\nagainst the extreme cold to which they would thus be sometimes liable.\r\nFrom the changeable nature of our climate, there is some difficulty in\r\napportioning the degree of applied heat, so as to suit exactly the\r\nrequirements of the plants in these respects; and it is especially\r\ndifficult to maintain with certainty the low degree of night temperature\r\nwhich would be desirable, and at the same time avoid risking the safety of\r\nthe plants, through a sudden declension of the temperature of the exterior\r\nair. At present this difficulty has to be met by extraordinary care on the\r\npart of the gardener, and often by serious encroachments on his proper\r\ntime for study and for rest: even then sometimes without success. This end\r\nwould be much more effectually and certainly secured by a _complete\r\nsystem_ of covering hot-houses and forcing-houses; and this plan would\r\nsecure the further advantage of avoiding the undue stimulation of the\r\nplants by a then unnecessary amount of heat, applied solely to prevent the\r\nvery evil which covering also prevents, namely, the risk of excessive cold\r\nduring the night.\r\n\r\nThe principle upon which a covering acts most efficiently, is that of\r\nenclosing a complete body or stratum of air exterior to the glass, this\r\nbody of air being entirely shut away from the surrounding outer\r\natmosphere. Air being a bad conductor of heat, the warmth of the interior\r\nis by this means prevented from passing to the exterior atmosphere; or, in\r\nother words, the exterior atmosphere, being prevented from coming in\r\ncontact with the glass, cannot absorb from the interior any material\r\nproportion of its heat. To secure this advantage, however, the coverings\r\n_must_ be kept from contact with the glass, and they should extend on\r\nevery side where the structure is formed of materials which readily\r\nconduct heat--such as glass or iron. The coverings should in fact form\r\nneither more nor less than _a close outer case_.\r\n\r\nOne point connected with the application of these coverings, which I\r\nconsider would constitute an improvement, and which, as far as I am aware,\r\nhas never been acted on, is that of having them to fit so accurately as to\r\nexclude the external air (a matter of no difficulty in the degree\r\nrequired), and then to have a series of ventilators provided, to stand\r\nopen during the night, whereby an interchange of the atmospheric volume\r\nwould take place throughout the night, without exposing the plants to\r\ncontact with cold air. The stagnation of the internal atmosphere would\r\nthus be prevented, in consequence of the interior air and the air between\r\nthe glass and the covering being of different degrees of density, owing to\r\ntheir being differently charged with heat. By this plan, therefore, I\r\nconceive that direct benefit would accrue to the plants; and it would also\r\nmaterially assist in preserving that cooler--but not cold--night\r\ntemperature, which the fear of injury from frost prevents from being more\r\nfully realised in ordinary cases.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe annexed diagram represents one of the many ways in which this idea\r\nmight be carried into practice. It will be understood that, as here shown,\r\nthe side shutters and end shutters (the latter not indicated), fit into\r\ngrooves, the upper groove being attached to iron pins, and thus fixed at a\r\nproper distance from the building, without obstructing the passage of air\r\nalong the enclosed space; and that on the lower side being so fixed as to\r\nexclude the external air in that direction. The top or roof shutters also\r\nrun into a groove along the ridge of the roof, and at the lower end fix\r\nclose down to the top of the side shutters, fastening with a button. Each\r\nof the shutters should have a projecting fillet fixed on one side, so as\r\nto shut close over the adjoining one. The shutters themselves should of\r\ncourse be made of light frame-work, strengthened where necessary, with\r\nsmall iron rods. The material used for covering them may be the asphalte\r\nfelt, now manufactured extensively for roofing purposes, or strong brown\r\npaper, coated with tar; the latter is used extensively in Germany for this\r\npurpose, and is found to be very durable and cheap; it is there even\r\npreferred to every other material.\r\n\r\nThough the covering of hot-houses has been already practised in some\r\ncases, I am not aware of any one having adopted a close covering with the\r\nview to facilitate ventilation or aëration during the night. It appears to\r\nme that the circulation of air, secured by the means here proposed, would\r\nhave much influence in excluding cold, whilst at the same time it would\r\nprevent the interior from becoming too warm and close.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On Transplanting and the use of Turf Pots._\r\n\r\nI have, at p. 26, given what appear to me to be some of the principal\r\nreasons against the practice of transplanting, or planting out, Cucumber\r\nand other plants. When this is done after any quantity of roots are\r\nproduced, some injury or check must be sustained during the process; and\r\nchecks of this kind are opposed to the realisation of the greatest results\r\nwithin the shortest period, which of course is the great object in view.\r\nWhere it is inconvenient to plant the seeds in the places the plants are\r\nintended to occupy, or to put out the young plants during the earliest\r\nperiod of their development, or where propagation by cuttings or layers,\r\nis adopted, and the plants of course have to be potted separately, so as\r\nto be in a removable state, the following simple plan may be adopted, and\r\nwill be found to combine all the advantages and conveniences attending the\r\nuse of pots, with the avoidance of the evils of transplantation, &c. The\r\nplan referred to, consists in the employment of turf or peat, so contrived\r\nas to supply the place of pots, and which of course at the time of\r\nplanting is simply placed, along with the plant it contains, at once into\r\nthe soil, without in the least disturbing the roots, which, growing\r\nthrough the substance of the turf, extend beyond it in all directions into\r\nthe free soil provided for them. These turf pots are made of spongy,\r\nfibrous turf--whether loamy or peaty is not material, provided it is full\r\nof fibre, so as to admit of being readily traversed by the roots. The\r\ngrassy surface is evenly removed, and the under-turves are cut three or\r\nfour inches in thickness, and are then divided into squares of about three\r\ninches across. The centre of each of these little squares is taken out by\r\nmeans of an iron scoop, such as that represented in the annexed sketch;\r\nand this is then filled up with soil, and the plant, or seed, or cutting,\r\nor layer, inserted as if it were into an ordinary flower pot. It will be\r\nobvious that by this plan, every plant is independent and perfectly\r\nremovable--thus securing the convenience of sowing or planting and rearing\r\nthe plants in pots during their earliest stages: on the other hand, at the\r\ntime of planting out permanently, the plant, turf, and all being set\r\ncarefully into the soil, no check is sustained, because the roots remain\r\nundisturbed, and may, as they advance, penetrate through the turf into the\r\nprepared soil which surrounds them; in this way the advantages of sowing\r\nor planting at the very first in the position the plants are intended to\r\noccupy permanently, are secured.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\nThis plan of sowing seeds, or of planting young plants intended for\r\ntransplantation, into pots made of turf, is not only applicable to\r\ncucumbers, but might be very extensively adopted in the case of annuals\r\nand half hardy plants raised in frames, during the spring, in large\r\nquantities for the flower garden. In these cases, however, as the quantity\r\nthat could be reared within a given space would be an object, the turves\r\nshould be as small as possible in their lateral dimensions--a bore of two\r\ninches and a half, with half an inch on each side, thus making the\r\ndiameter three inches and a half, would be found convenient in this\r\nrespect. For cucumbers, however, or when the plan was applied to any\r\nspecial object, a larger size might be employed, which would allow of the\r\nplants attaining a larger size before it would be necessary to place them\r\nin their permanent positions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On Watering the Soil._\r\n\r\nIn the diagram at p. 18, and the description of it at p. 20, I have\r\nindicated and recommended a plan of moistening the soil by pouring water\r\ndown beneath the soil: this was to be done by the help of tubes provided\r\nfor the purpose. The soil was supposed to rest on the top of the hot\r\nwater-tank, which was to supply bottom heat; and immediately beneath the\r\nsoil, a layer of open rubble was proposed to be placed, among which the\r\nwater applied might find its way, and gradually moisten the superincumbent\r\nsoil. Mr. Hunter, gardener at Mawley Hall, in detailing[3] his sixteen\r\nyears' experience in tank-heating, has in great measure corroborated\r\nthese views; and as his corroboration of the plan I have recommended,\r\nembodies some useful hints, I will quote the substance of his remarks:--\"I\r\nhad a pit erected, thirty-eight feet long, seven and a half wide, divided\r\ninto four compartments, for growing melons and cucumbers, with a tank\r\nextending the whole length of the pit, six feet wide and six inches deep.\r\nAcross this I put larch spars, and upon them turves, with the grassy side\r\ndownwards, and on them the soil for the melons and cucumbers. The plants\r\ngrew and did well for a time, but they were of short duration in\r\ncomparison with the dung-bed. Instead of the moisture ascending through\r\nthe soil as I expected, I found that the heat from the tank dried the\r\nturves and soil next to them as dry as dust, and that there was no such\r\nthing as obtaining a moist heat from hot water without the soil was in\r\ncontact with it. Next year I put broken stones upon the spars, and turves\r\nupon them, and made my arrangements so that I could occasionally run water\r\nin the tank to wet the turves and the soil next them. This was an\r\nimprovement; and I went on prosperously for some years, till the spars\r\nbegan to decay. I then had iron bars put across, and two of the\r\ncompartments covered with squares, a foot in diameter, and one inch thick;\r\nthe other two with slates; both slates and squares jointed with Roman\r\ncement, to prevent the soil from getting into the tank, as I had found the\r\ninconvenience of it when using the spars. I put some broken stones upon\r\nthe covers, and turves upon them, and then the soil. Here my original\r\ndifficulty occurred; the soil next the covers got too dry, and to moisten\r\nit from above was impracticable, without making the soil a complete\r\npuddle, which would have stopped the healthy growth of the plants. To\r\nremedy this, I put six small earthen pipes into each division, the one end\r\nresting upon the tank covers, the other standing up above the soil. When I\r\nfound by the watch sticks that the soil was getting dry, I poured water\r\ndown the pipes through a tin funnel which I had made on purpose; this\r\nspread itself over the surface of the tank covers, and diffused a gentle\r\nmoisture to the soil, so congenial to the growth of plants. This was a\r\nmove in the right direction. I then thought that it would be better to\r\npour the manure water down upon the tank covers, which I have done since.\r\nI found the broken stones over the tank covers troublesome; they were also\r\na harbour for wood-lice. I now use only a layer of leaves next the covers,\r\nand they are cleared out with the soil.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_On Atmospheric Humidity._\r\n\r\nCucumbers cannot at any time be successfully grown in an arid atmosphere,\r\nalthough, during the winter season, they require a much less proportion of\r\natmospheric humidity, than under the influence of longer days and brighter\r\nlight; and conversely, the degree which would be necessary to secure their\r\nwelfare in summer, would be fatal to them in winter. An experienced\r\ngardener would tell almost instinctively, at either season, whether a\r\nsufficient supply was present or not; but less experienced cultivators\r\nwould need some index, or register, to guide them. Such an index is\r\nafforded by the hygrometer; but most of the kinds of hygrometers are\r\ndelicate instruments, and hardly suited for garden use. What is needed in\r\nthis case is, not an instrument which requires minute observations and\r\ncalculations, but something that will at once indicate the atmospheric\r\nhumidity as plainly as the thermometer does the temperature, and which\r\nmay be as easily read off and understood. Simmons' hygrometer, recently\r\nintroduced to the notice of horticulturists, professes to supply this\r\ndesideratum; and though, perhaps, not a sufficiently accurate instrument\r\nfor purely scientific purposes, yet, as simply and clearly indicating what\r\nis at least an approximation to the existing degree of atmospheric\r\nhumidity, it is to be regarded as a useful garden hygrometer. By it, the\r\ndegree of dryness or humidity is indicated on a dial-plate, by means of a\r\nmoveable arm resembling the hand of a clock. The dial-plate is marked off\r\ninto degrees, expressing the amount of moisture in the air, between what\r\nis observed when the instrument is plunged in water on the one hand, and\r\nexposed to excessive dryness on the other. As my own experience of this\r\ninstrument, though favourable to its use, is still but limited, I cannot\r\ndo better than introduce here the following remarks of Mr. Beck, of\r\nIsleworth, a very successful cultivator of plants, and one who has had\r\nconsiderable experience in the use of these instruments. It will be\r\nobserved that Mr. Beck's standard for the orchid-house will be about\r\nsuitable for cucumbers.[4] Mr. Beck observes,--\"The skilful gardener,\r\nobserving the pointer to advance with dryness and return with moisture,\r\nwill soon form a standard for himself, by which to regulate his stove,\r\ngreenhouse, &c.; still some general scale is desirable. Two conditions\r\nmust be carefully observed:--1. The instrument must neither be hung in the\r\nsun, nor where it will be liable to get wetted or saturated. 2. It must\r\nnot be subjected to greater heat than is suited to vegetable life. For the\r\nsix months commencing with August and ending with January, 40 deg. in,\r\nthe morning, increasing to 60 deg. about noon, and declining again to 40\r\ndeg. at night, is about the right scale for the orchid-house; whilst a\r\nrange from 50 deg. to 80 deg. would be suitable for both the stove and\r\ngreenhouse in those months. In the other half year, February and July\r\ninclusive, 30 deg. to 40 deg., morning and evening, running up to 80 deg.\r\nin the middle of the day for the orchid-house; 40 deg. and 50 deg., and up\r\nto 70 deg. for the stove; and 50 deg. to 80 deg. for the greenhouse, will\r\nprove very suitable. The above scale is desirable, but I do not say it is\r\nalways attainable. Ours is an uncertain climate; sometimes a dry east wind\r\nwill almost parch us up; at other times a southerly one, with wet, will\r\ncause a superabundance, which will have to be corrected, possibly by a\r\ngentle fire, and a free admission of air. The alteration hereby effected\r\nin the atmosphere of the houses will soon be evidenced by the hygrometer,\r\nand mildew and fogging off be kept at a distance. Opposed to an excess of\r\nmoisture in the dull months of the year, is the dryness consequent on the\r\nsummer and autumnal sunshine. Then, during the heat of the days, the\r\ninstrument will seem to have run wild. Throwing water on the floors of the\r\nhouses, and every means of increasing the amount of moisture, seems but of\r\nlittle or temporary avail; Simmons will go up, spite of all, to 90 deg. or\r\n100 deg., and none the worse either, for it is still a faithful indicator,\r\nand as sure as the day declines, and the heat of the sun is withdrawn, so\r\nwill it come back to a suitable point, when the plants are watered and the\r\nfloors are wetted for the night. Remembering then, the variableness of our\r\nclimate, I candidly admit that I consider any precise directions of very\r\nlittle value. None can be given that shall be implicitly followed, or on\r\nwhich success shall certainly attend. Horticultural practice should be\r\nmade dependant upon ever-varying circumstances.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Belville, of the Royal Observatory, has constructed the following\r\nTable, from a series of observations made with Simmons' hygrometer in\r\nconnexion with the dew point, as obtained by a Mason's hygrometer, or a\r\ndry and wet thermometer.\r\n\r\n  +------------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  |  Range            Mean   |                                       |\r\n  |of Simmons'    Humidity of|                                       |\r\n  |Hygrometer.       the Air.|                                       |\r\n  +--------------------------|                                       |\r\n  | 20° to  30°        1·00  |Extreme saturation; air precipitates   |\r\n  |                          | moisture at a fall of temperature.    |\r\n  | 30  ..  40         0·96  |                                       |\r\n  | 40  ..  50         0·89  |                                       |\r\n  | 50  ..  60         0·81  |                                       |\r\n  | 60  ..  70         0·77  | }                                     |\r\n  | 70  ..  80         0·72  | }Ordinary fine dry weather.           |\r\n  | 80  ..  90         0·67  | }                                     |\r\n  | 90  .. 100         0·59  |                                       |\r\n  |100  .. 120         0·50  | Air contains one half of the moisture |\r\n  |                          |  it is capable of holding in solution;|\r\n  |                          |  in England very dry weather.         |\r\n  +--------------------------+---------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n     Example:--Suppose hygrometer read 45°, the mean humidity\r\n     corresponding is 93.

The front may\r\nbe formed of two course of brick-on-edge, and if divisions are required,\r\nthey should be formed in the same way. The bottom should be made even, and\r\nrendered dry. The material for forming the bed itself consists of short\r\nstable litter, with horse-droppings, but chiefly the latter, brought to a\r\ncertain state of fermentation. The droppings and litter should be obtained\r\ndaily from the stable, until enough for a bed is collected; it should,\r\nfrom day to day, be thrown up into a flattish heap, in a dry place, where\r\nit will ferment very slightly. As soon as enough is got together to begin\r\nto ferment, the heap must be turned over; and in these turnings, the outer\r\nand inner parts of the heap, as well as the fresh and the fermenting, must\r\nbe well mixed up together; the heaps should be turned every second day,\r\nand should never be made large, or else the dung would become both too hot\r\nand too dry, either of which would spoil it. To avoid this, the heaps\r\nshould be flat and shallow, with as much outside as possible; in this way\r\nthe air, acting on a considerable portion of it, renders it rather dry,\r\nand checks too rapid fermentation. This preparation must be continued\r\nuntil the whole mass is brought to an uniform mild, dryish state of\r\nfermentation. Then the bed may be made in the following manner:--About\r\nthree inches of the prepared dung is laid evenly over the bottom, and is\r\nbeaten down firmly with a flat heavy wooden mallet. Another layer is then\r\nput on in the same way, and this is repeated until the bed is formed to a\r\nthickness of about six inches. The next two inches of the dung should have\r\nabout a sixth part of light turfy loam reduced to mould, and sifted, mixed\r\nwith it to give it body. The bed is now prepared, and is to be spawned as\r\nsoon as it is seen that it does not heat violently. The heat ought not to\r\nexceed 90 degrees: if it reaches higher than this, holes must be made, a\r\nfew inches apart, to let the heat pass off, and in a day or two these may\r\nbe filled up again. The spawn is to be put in when the heat ranges about\r\n75 degrees; lumps of spawn about as large as a small egg may be used; a\r\nhole should be made with the fingers about two inches deep, the spawn\r\ninserted, and the material of the bed closed about it. Probably by this\r\ntime there will be no danger of overheating, and if so, the soil may be\r\nput on; if, however, there is any inclination to overheat, wait till it\r\nhas passed off before putting on the soil. The soil used should be\r\ndecomposed turfy loam, moderately dry, so as to bear compression without\r\nrunning together like paste, but damp enough to become firm, close, and\r\neven, when beaten closely. About two inches in thickness should be put on,\r\nand this is to be beaten down quite firm and close. The beds are then\r\nfinished. It is as well to cover the surface with a thin layer of short\r\nhay, to prevent it becoming quite dry. Mushroom beds seldom require water;\r\nafter they have been some time in bearing, the beds sometimes get dry, and\r\nin such cases, if they have a moderate soaking of _tepid_ water, and the\r\nsurface is covered as before, a new crop will spring up. The covering is\r\nbest removed when the beds are in bearing. It is seldom advisable to apply\r\nwater when the beds are coming into bearing. Water should never be used in\r\nany other than a tepid state.\r\n\r\nMushrooms are most prized in the summer, though the atmosphere of a\r\ncucumber-house would not then be suitable for them, unless the space about\r\nthem could be closed in, so as to retain a close, somewhat humid\r\natmosphere. They would succeed very well without being enclosed, during\r\nthe season for forcing cucumbers.\r\n\r\nUnder the treatment which has been detailed, the beds would usually come\r\ninto bearing in about six weeks from the time of spawning; and, under\r\nfavourable circumstances, would continue in bearing for two or three\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFootnotes:\r\n\r\n[1] The Journal of the Horticultural Society of London, vol.
