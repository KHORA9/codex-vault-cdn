A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              INTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nI have been asked to furnish an introduction for a new edition of \"The\r\nYoung Marooners.\"  As an introduction is unnecessary, the writing of it\r\nmust be to some extent perfunctory.  The book is known in many lands and\r\nlanguages.  It has survived its own success, and has entered into\r\nliterature.  It has become a classic. The young marooners themselves\r\nhave reached middle age, and some of them have passed away, but their\r\nadventures are as fresh and as entertaining as ever.\r\n\r\nDr. Goulding’s work possesses all the elements of enduring popularity.\r\nIt has the strength and vigour of simplicity; its narrative flows\r\ncontinuously forward; its incidents are strange and thrilling, and\r\nunderneath all is a moral purpose sanely put.\r\n\r\nThe author himself was surprised at the great popularity of his story,\r\nand has written a history of its origin as a preface.  The internal\r\nevidence is that the book is not the result of literary ambition, but of\r\na strong desire to instruct and amuse his own children, and the story is\r\nso deftly written that the instruction is a definite part of the\r\nnarrative.  The art here may be unconscious, but it is a very fine art\r\nnevertheless.\r\n\r\nDr. Goulding lived a busy life.  He had the restless missionary spirit\r\nwhich he inherited from the Puritans of Dorchester, England, who\r\nestablished themselves in Dorchester, South Carolina, and in Dorchester,\r\nGeorgia, before the Revolutionary War.  Devoting his life to good works,\r\nhe nevertheless found time to indulge his literary faculty; he also\r\nfound time to indulge his taste for mechanical invention.  He invented\r\nthe first sewing-machine that was ever put in practical use in the\r\nSouth. His family were using this machine a year before the Howe patents\r\nwere issued.  In his journal of that date (1845) he writes: \"Having\r\nsatisfied myself about my machine, I laid it aside that I might attend\r\nto other and weightier duties.\"  He applied for no patent.\r\n\r\n\"The Young Marooners\" was begun in 1847, continued in a desultory way,\r\nand completed in 1850.  Its first title was a quaint one, \"Bobbins and\r\nCruisers Company.\"  It was afterward called \"Robert and Harold; or, the\r\nYoung Marooners.\"  The history of the manuscript of the book is an\r\ninteresting parallel to that of many other successful books.  After\r\nhaving been positively declined in New York, it was for months left in\r\nPhiladelphia, where one night, as the gentleman whose duty it was to\r\npass judgment upon the material offered had begun in a listless way his\r\ntask, he became so much absorbed in the story that he did not lay it\r\ndown until long after midnight, and hastening to the publishers early\r\nnext morning, insisted that it should be immediately put into print.\r\nThree editions were issued in the first year, and it was soon reprinted\r\nin England by Nisbet & Co., of London, followed by five other houses in\r\nEngland and Scotland at later dates.\r\n\r\nDr. Goulding was the author of \"Little Josephine,\" published in\r\nPhiladelphia (1848); \"The Young Marooners\" (1852); \"Confederate\r\nSoldiers’ Hymn-Book,\" a compilation (1863); \"Marooner’s Island,\" an\r\nindependent sequel to \"Young Marooners\" (1868); \"Frank Gordon; or, When\r\nI was Little Boy\" (1869), and \"The Woodruff Stories\" (1870).  With the\r\nexception of \"Little Josephine\" and the \"Hymn-Book,\" they have all been\r\nrepublished abroad.  Born near Midway, Liberty County, Georgia,\r\nSeptember 28th, 1810, he died August 21st, 1881, and is buried in the\r\nlittle churchyard at Roswell, Georgia.\r\n\r\nJOEL CHANDLER HARRIS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                        THE HISTORY OF THIS BOOK\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a vine-covered piazza of the sunny South, a company of boys and girls\r\nused to gather round me, of a summer evening, to hear the varied story\r\nof my early years. As these boys and girls grew larger, I found it\r\nnecessary to change my plan of instruction. There were many _facts in\r\nnature_ which I wished to communicate, and many _expedients_ in\r\npractical life, which I supposed might be useful. To give this\r\ninformation, in such shape as to insure its being remembered, required a\r\nstory. The result has been a book; and that book is \"The Young\r\nMarooners\"--or, as my young folks call it, \"Robert and Harold.\"\r\n\r\nTheir interest in the story has steadily increased from the beginning to\r\nthe end; and sure am I, that if it excites one-half as much abroad, as\r\nit has excited at home, no author need ask for more.\r\n\r\nThe story, however, is not all a story; the fiction consists mostly in\r\nthe putting together. With very few exceptions, the incidents are real\r\noccurrences; and whoever will visit the regions described, will see that\r\nthe pictures correspond to nature. Possibly also, the visitor may meet\r\neven now, with a fearless Harold, an intelligent Robert, a womanly Mary,\r\nand a merry Frank.\r\n\r\nShould my young readers ever go _marooning_, I trust their party may\r\nmeet with fewer misfortunes and as happy a termination.\r\n\r\nF.

EMBARKATION\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Saturday, the 21st of August, 1830, a small but beautiful brig left\r\nthe harbour of Charleston, South Carolina, bound for Tampa Bay, Florida.\r\nOn board were nine passengers; Dr. Gordon, his three children, Robert,\r\nMary, and Frank; his sister’s son, Harold McIntosh, and four servants.\r\n\r\nDr. Gordon was a wealthy physician, who resided, during the winter, upon\r\nthe seaboard of Georgia, and during the summer upon a farm in the\r\nmountains of that beautifully varied and thriving State.  His wife was a\r\nCarolinian, from the neighbourhood of Charleston. Anna Gordon, his\r\nsister, married a Col. McIntosh, who, after residing for twelve years\r\nupon a plantation near the city of Montgomery, in Alabama, died, leaving\r\nhis widow with three children, and an encumbered estate. Soon after her\r\nwidowhood, Dr. Gordon paid her a visit, for the two-fold purpose of\r\ncondolence and of aiding in the settlement of her affairs.  She was so\r\ngreatly pleased with the gentlemanly bearing and the decided\r\nintelligence of Robert, who on this occasion accompanied his father,\r\nthat she requested the privilege of placing her son Harold under her\r\nbrother’s care, until some other arrangement could be made for his\r\neducation.  Dr. Gordon was equally prepossessed with the frank manners\r\nand manly aspect of his nephew, and it was with peculiar pleasure that\r\nhe acceded to the request.  Harold had been with his uncle about a month\r\nprevious to the period at which this history begins.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gordon was a woman of warm affections and cultivated mind, but of\r\nfeeble constitution.  She had been the mother of five children; but,\r\nduring the infancy of the last, her health exhibited so many signs of\r\ndecay as to convince her husband that the only hope of saving her life\r\nwas to seek for her, during the ensuing winter, a climate even more\r\nbland than that in which she had spent her girlhood.\r\n\r\nTampa Bay is a military post of the United States. Dr. Gordon had\r\nformerly visited it, and was so delighted with its soft Italian climate,\r\nand with the wild beauty of its shores, that he had even then purchased\r\na choice lot in the vicinity of the fort, and ever after had looked\r\nforward, almost with hope, to the time when he might have some excuse\r\nfor removing there.  That time had now come.  And doubting not that the\r\nrestorative powers of the climate would exert a happy influence upon his\r\nwife’s health, he left her with her relatives, while he went to Tampa\r\nfor the purpose of preparing a dwelling suitable for her reception.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying party was larger than he had at first intended.  Robert\r\nand Harold were to go of course; they were old enough to be his\r\ncompanions; and, moreover, Harold had been sent by his mother for the\r\nexpress purpose of enjoying that excellent _home education_ which had\r\nbeen so happily exhibited in Robert.  But on mature reflection there\r\nappeared to Dr. Gordon special reasons why he should also take his\r\neldest daughter, Mary, who was about eleven years of age, and his second\r\nson, Frank, who was between seven and eight.  The addition of these\r\nyounger persons to the party, however, did not cause him any anxiety, or\r\nany addition to the number of his servants; for he and his wife,\r\nalthough wealthy by inheritance, and accustomed all their lives to the\r\nhelp of servants, had educated their children to be as independent as\r\npossible of unnecessary help. Indeed, Mary was qualified to be of great\r\nassistance; for though only eleven years of age, she was an excellent\r\nhousekeeper, and during the indisposition of her mother had presided\r\nwith remarkable ability at her father’s table.  Little Frank was too\r\nyoung to be useful, but he was an obedient, merry little fellow, a great\r\npet with everybody, and promised, by his cheerful good nature, to add\r\nmuch to the enjoyment of the party; and as to the care which he needed,\r\nMary had only to continue that motherly attention which she had been\r\naccustomed already to bestow.\r\n\r\nTo say a word or two more of the youths; Robert Gordon, now nearly\r\nfourteen years of age, had a great thirst for knowledge.  Stimulated\r\ncontinually by the instructive conversation of his father, who spared no\r\npains in his education, he drew rapidly from all the sources opened to\r\nhim by books, society, and nature.  His finely developed mind was\r\ndecidedly of a philosophic cast. Partaking, however, of the delicate\r\nconstitution of his mother, he was oftentimes averse to those athletic\r\nexercises which became his age, and by which he would have been fitted\r\nfor a more vigorous and useful manhood.\r\n\r\nHarold McIntosh, a half year older than his cousin, was, on the\r\ncontrary, of a robust constitution and active habit, with but little\r\ninclination for books.  Through the inattention of a father, who seemed\r\nto care more for manly daring than for intellectual culture, his\r\neducation had been sadly neglected.  The advantages afforded him had\r\nbeen of an exceedingly irregular character, and his only incentive to\r\nstudy had been the gratification of his mother, whom he tenderly loved.\r\nFor years preceding the change of his abode, a large portion of his\r\nleisure time had been spent in visiting an old Indian of the\r\nneighbourhood, by the name of Torgah, and gleaning from him by\r\nconversation and practice, that knowledge of wood-craft, which nothing\r\nbut an Indian’s experience can furnish, and which usually possesses so\r\nromantic a charm for Southern and Western (perhaps we may say for\r\nAmerican) boys.\r\n\r\nThe cousins had become very much attached.  Each admired the other’s\r\nexcellencies, and envied the other’s accomplishments; and the parents\r\nhad good reason to hope that they would prove of decided benefit to each\r\nother by mutual example.\r\n\r\nPreparing for a winter’s residence at such a place as Tampa, where, with\r\nthe exception of what was to be obtained at the fort, they would be far\r\nremoved from all the comforts and appliances of civilized life, Dr.\r\nGordon was careful to take with him everything which could be foreseen\r\nas needful.  Among these may be mentioned the materials already framed\r\nfor a small dwelling-house, kitchen, and stable; ample stores of\r\nprovisions, poultry, goats (as being more convenient than cows), a pair\r\nof horses, a buggy, and wagon, a large and beautiful pleasure boat,\r\nbooks for reading, and for study, together with such furniture as habit\r\nhad made necessary to comfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTHER CARY’S CHICKENS--FISHING FOR TROUT--SAW-FISH--FRANK AND THE\r\nSHARK---LOOMING---TOM STARBOARD--THE NAUTILUS--ARRIVAL AT TAMPA\r\n\r\n\r\nMary and Frank were affected with sea sickness shortly after entering\r\nthe rough and rolling water on the bar, and having, in consequence,\r\nretired early to bed, they scarcely rose for six and thirty hours.\r\nIndeed, all the passengers, except Harold, suffered in turn this usual\r\ninconvenience of persons unaccustomed to the sea.\r\n\r\nThe only incident of interest that occurred during this part of the\r\nvoyage, was a fright received by Mary and Frank.  It was as follows:\r\nHaving partially recovered from their indisposition, they were engaged\r\nwith childish glee in fishing from the stern windows.  Directly over\r\nhead hung the jolly boat, and beneath them the water foamed and eddied\r\nround the rudder.  Mary was fishing for Mother Cary’s chickens--a\r\nspecies of \"poultry\" well known to those who go to sea.  Her apparatus\r\nconsisted of a strong thread, twenty or thirty yards long, having divers\r\nloops upon it, and baited at the end with a little tuft of red.  She had\r\nnot succeeded in taking any; but one, more daring than the rest, had\r\nbecome entangled in the thread, and Mary eagerly drew it towards her,\r\nexclaiming, \"I have caught it!  I have caught it!\"  Ere, however, she\r\ncould bring it within arm’s length, the struggling bird had escaped.\r\n\r\nFrank had obtained a large fish-hook, which he tied to a piece of twine,\r\nand baited with some raw beef; and he was fishing, he said, for _trout_.\r\nA few minutes after Mary’s adventure with the bird, he saw a great fish,\r\ntwice as long as himself, having an enormous snout, set on both sides\r\nwith a multitude of sharp teeth, following in the vessel’s wake.  He\r\ndrew himself quickly into the window, exclaiming, \"Look, sister, look!\"\r\nThe fish did not continue long to follow them.  It seemed to have come\r\non a voyage of curiosity, and having satisfied itself that this great\r\nswimming monster, the vessel, was neither whale nor kraken, it darted\r\noff and returned no more.\r\n\r\n\"I should not like to hook _that_ fellow,\" said Frank, \"for I am sure I\r\ncould not draw him in.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Mary, \"and I should not like to have such an ugly fellow\r\non board, if we could get him here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ugh! what a long ugly nose he has,\" said Frank.  \"I wonder what he can\r\ndo with such a nose, and with all those teeth on the outside of it--only\r\nsee, sister, _teeth on his_ NOSE!\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" she answered, \"but we can ask father when we go on\r\ndeck.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think his nose must be long to smell things a great way off,\"\r\nconjectured Frank.\r\n\r\nThus they chatted until Mary called out, \"See, Frank, there is a black\r\npiece of wood sticking out of the water. See how it floats after us!\r\nNo, it cannot be a piece of wood, for it swims from side to side.  It\r\nmust be a fish. It is!  Draw in your head, Frank.\"\r\n\r\nUnsuccessful in his trout fishing, Frank had attached a red silk\r\nhandkerchief to his line, and was amusing himself with letting it down\r\nso as to touch along the water. When Mary said \"it is a fish,\" he espied\r\nan enormous creature, much larger than the sawfish, swimming almost\r\nunder him, and looking up hungrily to the window where they were.  A\r\nmoment after it leaped directly towards them.  Both screamed with\r\nterror, and Frank’s wrist was jerked so violently, and pained him so\r\nmuch, that he was certain his hand had been bitten off.  He was about to\r\nscream again; but looking down, he found his hand was safe, and the next\r\nmoment saw the fish swimming away with the end of the handkerchief\r\nhanging from its mouth.  The fish was a shark.  It had been attracted\r\nprobably by the smell of Frank’s bait, and by the sight of the red silk.\r\nWhen he drew his handkerchief from the water, the fish leaped after it,\r\nand jerked the twine which had been wrapped around his wrist.  From that\r\ntime they ceased all fishing from the cabin windows.\r\n\r\nThe history of that fishing, however, was not yet ended. On the day\r\nfollowing the company were much interested in watching a singular\r\nphenomenon, which is sometimes visible at sea, though seldom in a\r\nlatitude so low as Florida.  The looming of the land had been remarkably\r\ndistinct and beautiful; at one time the land looked as if lifted far\r\nabove the water; at another the shore was seen doubled, as if the water\r\nwere a perfect reflector, and the land and its shadow were united at the\r\nbase.  But, on the present occasion, the shadow appeared in the wrong\r\nplace--united to its substance, not at the base, but at the top.  It was\r\na most singular spectacle to behold trees growing topsy-turvy, from land\r\nin the sky.\r\n\r\nThe sailors, as well as passengers, looked on with a curiosity not\r\nunmixed with awe, and an old \"salt\" was heard to mutter, as he ominously\r\nshook his head,\r\n\r\n\"I never seed the likes of that but something was sure to come after.\r\nYes,\" he continued, looking sullenly at Mary and Frank, \"and yesterday,\r\nwhen I was at the starn, I saw a chicken flutter in a string.\"\r\n\r\n\"A chicken, Tom?\" inquired the captain, looking at the little culprits.\r\n\"Ah, have any of my young friends been troubling the sailor’s pets?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" responded Frank, promptly and indignantly. \"We did not\r\ntrouble anybody’s chickens.  I only went to the coop, and pulled the old\r\ndrake’s tail; but I did that to make him look at the bread I brought\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not mean the chickens on board, but the chickens that fly around\r\nus--Mother Cary’s chickens,\" said the captain, trying hard to smother\r\ndown a laugh.  \"Don’t you know that they all belong to the sailors; and\r\nthat whoever troubles them is sure to bring trouble on the ship?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir,\" Frank persisted, evidently convinced that the captain was\r\ntrying to tease him.  \"I did not know that they belonged to anybody.  I\r\nthought that they were all wild.\"\r\n\r\nMary, however, looked guilty.  She knew well the sailor’s superstition\r\nabout the \"chickens,\" but having had at that time nothing to do, she had\r\nbeen urged on by an irrepressible desire for fun, and until this moment\r\nhad imagined that her fishing was unnoticed.  She timidly answered,\r\n\r\n\"I did not _catch_ it, sir; I only tangled it in the thread, and it got\r\naway before I touched it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Tom,\" said the captain to the sailor, who seemed to be in doubt\r\nafter Frank’s defence whether to appear pleased or angry, \"I think you\r\nwill have to forgive the offence this time, especially as the sharks\r\ntook it in hand so soon to revenge the insult, and ran away with the\r\nlittle fellow’s handkerchief.\"\r\n\r\nOld Tom smiled grimly at the allusion to the shark; for he had been\r\nsitting quietly in the jolly boat picking rope, and had witnessed the\r\nwhole adventure.\r\n\r\nThe wind, which had continued favourable ever since they left\r\nCharleston, now gradually died away.  The boatswain whistled often and\r\nshrilly to bring it back; but it was like \"calling spirits from the\r\nvasty deep.\"  The sails hung listlessly down, and moved only as the\r\nvessel rocked sluggishly upon the scarce undulating surface.  The only\r\ncircumstance which enlivened this scene was the appearance of a\r\nnautilus, or Portuguese man-of-war. Mary was the first to discern it.\r\nShe fancied that it was a tiny toy boat, launched by some child on\r\nshore, and wafted by the wind to this distant point.  It was certainly a\r\ntoy vessel, though one of nature’s workmanship; for there was the\r\nfloating body corresponding to the hull, there the living passenger,\r\nthere the sails spread or furled at will, and there the oars (Mary could\r\nsee them move) by which the little adventurer paddled itself along.\r\n\r\nThe young people were very anxious to obtain it. Frank went first to old\r\nTom Starboard (as the sailor was called who had scolded him and Mary,\r\nbut who was now on excellent terms with both) to ask whether they might\r\nhave the nautilus if they could catch it.\r\n\r\n\"Have the man-o’-war!\" ejaculated the old man, opening wide his eyes,\r\n\"who ever heered of sich a thing? O yes, have it, if you can get it; but\r\nhow will you do that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Brother Robert and cousin Harold will row after it and pick it up, if\r\nthe captain will let them have his boat.\"\r\n\r\nTom chuckled at the idea, and said he doubted not the captain would let\r\nthem have his boat, and be glad, too, to see the fun.  Frank then went\r\nto the captain, and told him that old Tom had given him leave to have\r\nthe man-of-war if he could get it; and that his brother and cousin would\r\ngo out and pick it up, if the captain would let them have his boat.\r\nWith a good-natured smile, he answered,\r\n\r\n\"You are perfectly welcome to the boat, my little man; but if your\r\nbrother and cousin catch that little sailor out there, they will be much\r\nsmarter than most folks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can they not pick it up?\"\r\n\r\n\"Easily enough, if it will wait till they come.  But if they do not wish\r\nto be hurt, they had better take a basket or net for dipping it from the\r\nwater.\"\r\n\r\nFrank went finally to his father to obtain his consent, which after a\r\nmoment’s hesitation was granted, the doctor well knowing what the\r\nprobable result would be, yet pleased to afford them any innocent\r\namusement by which to enliven their voyage.\r\n\r\n\"Tom,\" said the captain, \"lower away the jolly boat, and do you go with\r\nthese young gentlemen.  Row softly as you can, and give them the best\r\nchance for getting what they want.\"\r\n\r\nThe boat was soon alongside.  Old Tom slid down by a rope, but Robert\r\nand Harold were let down more securely.  They shoved off from the\r\nvessel’s side, and glided so noiselessly along, that the water was\r\nscarcely rippled.  Harold stood in the bow, and Robert amidships, one\r\nwith a basket, and the other with a scoop net, ready to dip it from the\r\nwater.  A cat creeping upon a shy bird could not have been more stealthy\r\nin its approach.  But somehow the little sensitive thing became aware of\r\nits danger, and ere the boat’s prow had come within ten feet, it quickly\r\ndrew in its many arms, and sank like lead beyond their sight.\r\n\r\n\"Umph!\" said old Tom, with an expressive grunt, \"I said you might have\r\nit, if you could catch it.\"\r\n\r\nOn the first day of September the voyagers approached some placid\r\nlooking islands, tasselled above with lofty palmettoes, and varied\r\nbeneath with every hue of green, from the soft colour of the mallow to\r\nthe sombre tint of the cedar and the glossy green of the live oak.\r\nBetween these islands the vessel passed, so near to one that they could\r\nsee a herd of deer peeping at them through the thin growth of the bluff,\r\nand a flock of wild turkeys flying to a distant grove.\r\n\r\nBeyond the islands lay, in perfect repose, the waters of that bay whose\r\ntranquil beauty has been a theme of admiration with every one whose\r\nprivilege it has been to look upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nTAMPA BAY--BELLEVUE--UNLADING--A DANGEROUS CUT--HOW TO STOP A BLEEDING\r\nARTERY--TOM STARBOARD AGAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nTampa Bay is a perfect gem of its kind.  Running eastward from the gulf\r\nfor twelve or fifteen miles, then turning suddenly to the North, it is\r\nso far sheltered from within, that, except in case of severe westerly\r\ngales, its waters are ever quiet and clear as crystal.  Its beach is\r\ncomposed of sand and broken shells of such snowy whiteness as almost to\r\ndazzle the eye, and it slopes so gradually from the land, that, in many\r\nplaces, a child may wade for a great distance without danger.  To those\r\nwho bathe in its limpid waters it is a matter of curiosity to see below,\r\nthe slow crawling of the conch, while the nimble crab scampers off in\r\nhaste, and fish and prawn dart wantonly around.  When the tide is down\r\nthere is no turnpike in the world better fitted for a pleasure ride than\r\nthat smooth hard beach, from which no dust can rise, and which is of\r\ncourse as level as a floor.\r\n\r\nThe spot on which Dr. Gordon proposed to build, was one commanding a\r\nview both of the distant fort and of the open sea, or rather of the\r\ngreen islands which guarded the mouth of the bay.  It already contained\r\na small house, with two rooms, erected by a white adventurer, and\r\nafterwards sold to an Indian chief of the better class.  Dr. Gordon had\r\nbeen originally attracted by the picturesque beauty of its location,\r\nand, on closer inspection, still more interested by seeing on each side\r\nof the chief’s door a large bell pepper, that, having grown for years\r\nuntouched by frost, had attained the height of eight or ten feet, and\r\nwas covered all the year round with magnificent bells of green and\r\ncrimson.  The old chief was dead, and the premises had been vacated for\r\nmore than a year.\r\n\r\nEarly in the afternoon the brig anchored opposite this spot, to which\r\nDr. Gordon had given the name of Bellevue.  All hands were called to\r\nassist the ship carpenter and Sam (Dr. Gordon’s negro carpenter), to\r\nbuild a pier head, or wharf, extending from the shore to the vessel;\r\nthis occupied them till nightfall, and the work of unlading continued\r\nthrough a great part of the night, and past the middle of the next day.\r\n\r\nThe work was somewhat delayed by an untoward accident befalling one of\r\nthe sailors, and threatening for a time to take his life.  Peter, the\r\nbrother of Sam, was standing on the gangway, with his ax on his\r\nshoulder, just as two of the sailors were coming out with a heavy box.\r\nHearing behind him the noise of their trampling, he turned quickly\r\naround to see what it was, at the moment when the sailor, who was\r\nwalking backwards, turned his head to see that the gangway was clear.\r\nBy these two motions, quickly made, the head was brought towards the ax,\r\nand the ax towards the head, and the consequence was that the sailor’s\r\ntemple received a terrible gash.  The blood gushed out in successive\r\njets, proving that the cut vessel was an artery.  Setting down the box\r\nwith all speed, the assisting sailor seized the skin of the wounded\r\ntemple and tried with both hands to bring the gaping lips together, so\r\nas to stop the bleeding. His effort was in vain.  The blood gushed\r\nthrough his fingers, and ran down to his elbows.  By this time the\r\ncaptain reached the spot, and seeing that an artery was cut, directed\r\nthe sailor to press with his finger on the _heart_ side of the wound.\r\nIn a moment the jets ceased; for the arterial blood is driven by the\r\nheart towards the extremities, and therefore moves by jets as the heart\r\nbeats, while the _venous_, or black blood, is on its way _from the\r\nextremities_ to the heart; consequently, the pressure, which stops the\r\nflow from a wound in either vein or artery, must correspond to the\r\ndirection in which the blood is flowing.  [_See note p._ 16.]\r\n\r\nWhile the sailor was thus stopping the blood by the pressure of his\r\nfinger on the side from which the current came, the captain hastily\r\nprepared a ball of soft oakum, about the size of a small apple.  This he\r\nlaid upon the wound, and bound tightly to the head by means of a\r\nhandkerchief.  It is probable the flow might have been staunched had the\r\ncompress been sufficiently tight, but for some reason the blood forced\r\nitself through all the impediments, saturated the tarred oakum, and\r\ntrickled down the sailor’s face.  During this scene Dr. Gordon was at\r\nhis house on the bluff.  Hearing through a runner, dispatched by the\r\ncaptain, that a man was bleeding to death, he pointed to a quantity of\r\ncobwebs that hung in large festoons from the unceiled roof, and directed\r\nhim to bring a handful of these to the vessel, remarking, that \"_nothing\r\nstopped blood more quickly than cobwebs_.\"\r\n\r\nThe sailor was by this time looking pale and ready to faint.  Dr. Gordon\r\ninquired of the captain what had been done, pronounced it all right, and\r\ndeclared that he should probably have tried the same plan, but further\r\nremarked,\r\n\r\n\"This artery in the temple is oftentimes exceedingly difficult to manage\r\nby pressure.  You may stop for a time the bleeding of _any_ artery by\r\npressing with sufficient force upon the right place; or, if necessary to\r\nadopt so summary a mode, you may obliterate it altogether by _burning\r\nwith a hot iron_.  But in the present case I will show you an easier\r\nplan.\"\r\n\r\nWhile speaking he had removed the bandages, and taken out his lancet;\r\nand, to the captain’s amazement, in uttering the last words, he cut the\r\nbleeding artery in two, saying, \"Now bring me some cold water.\"\r\n\r\nThe captain was almost disposed to stay the doctor’s arm, supposing that\r\nhe was about to make a fatal mistake; but when he saw the jets of blood\r\ninstantly diminish, he exclaimed, \"What new wonder is this!  Here I have\r\nbeen trying for half an hour to staunch the blood by _closing_ the\r\nwound, while you have done it in a moment, by making the wound greater.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is one of the secrets of the art,\" responded the doctor, \"but a\r\nsecret which I will explain by the fact, that _severed_ arteries always\r\ncontract and close more or less perfectly; whereas, if they should be\r\nonly _split_ or _partly cut_, the same contraction will keep the orifice\r\nopen and bleeding.  I advise you never to try it, except when you know\r\nthe artery to be small, or when every other expedient has failed.  But\r\nhere comes the bucket.  See what a fine styptic cold water is.\"\r\n\r\nHe washed the wound till it was thoroughly cooled; after which he\r\nbrought its lips together by a few stitches made with a bent needle, and\r\nputting on the cobwebs and bandage, pronounced the operation complete.\r\n\r\n\"Live and larn!\" muttered old Tom Starboard, as he turned away from this\r\nscene of surgery.  \"I knew it took a smart man to manage a ship; but\r\nI’ll be hanged if there a’n’t smart people in this world besides\r\nsailors.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe main arteries in a man’s limbs are _deeply buried and lie in the\r\nsame general direction with the inner seams of his coat sleeves and of\r\nhis pantaloons_.  When one of them is cut--which may be known by the\r\nlight red blood flowing in jets, as above described--all the bandages in\r\nthe world will be insufficient to staunch it, except imperfectly, and\r\nfor a time, it must be tied or cauterized.  If any one knows the\r\nposition of the wounded artery, the best bandage for effecting a\r\ntemporary stoppage of the blood, is the _tourniquet_, which is made to\r\npress like a big strong finger directly upon it on the side from which\r\nthe blood is flowing.  A good substitute for the tourniquet may be\r\nextemporized out of a handkerchief or other strong bandage, and a piece\r\nof corn-cob two inches long, or a suitable piece of wood or stone.  This\r\nlast is to be placed so as to press directly over the artery; and the\r\nbandage to be made very tight by means of a stick run through it so as\r\nto twist it up with great power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nCONFUSION--HOUSEKEEPING IN A HURRY--FIRST NIGHT ON SHORE--COMPANY TO\r\nDINNER--\"BLUE EYED MARY\"--ROBERT AT PRAYER-MEETING--DANGER OF DESCENDING\r\nAN OLD WELL--RECOVERING A KNIFE DROPPED IN A WELL\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible, for one who has not tried it, to conceive the\r\nutter confusion which ensues on removing, in a hurry, one’s goods and\r\nchattels to a place too small for their accommodation.  Oh! the\r\nwilderness of boxes, baskets, bundles, heaped in disorder everywhere!\r\nand the perfect bewilderment into which one is thrown, when attempting\r\nthe simplest act of household duty.\r\n\r\n\"Judy,\" said Mary to the cook, the evening that they landed, and while\r\nthe servants were hurrying to bring under shelter the packages which Dr.\r\nGordon was unwilling to leave exposed to the night air, \"Judy, the sun\r\nis only about an hour high.  Make haste and get some tea ready for\r\nsupper.  Father says you need not _cook_ anything, we can get along on\r\ncheese and crackers.\"\r\n\r\nWell, surely, it sounded like a trifle to order only a little tea.  Mary\r\nthought so, and so did Judy,--it could be got ready in a minute.  But\r\njust at that moment of unreadiness, there were some difficulties in the\r\nway which neither cook nor housekeeper anticipated. To have tea for\r\nsupper ordinarily requires that one should have fire and water, and a\r\ntea kettle and a tea pot, and the tea itself, and cups and saucers and\r\nspoons, and sugar and milk, and a sugar pot and milk pot, besides a\r\nnumber of other things.  But how these things are to be brought\r\ntogether, in their proper relation, and in a hurry, when they are all\r\nthrown promiscuously in a heap, is a question more easily asked than\r\nanswered.\r\n\r\nThe simple order to prepare a little tea threw poor Judy into a fluster.\r\n\"Yes, misses,\" she mechanically replied, \"but wey I gwine fin’ de tea?\"\r\n\r\nMary was about to say, \"In the sideboard of course,\" knowing that at\r\nhome it was always kept there, when suddenly she recollected that the\r\npresent sideboard was a new one, packed with table and bed clothes, and\r\nmoreover that it was nailed up fast in a long box.  Then, where was the\r\ntea?  O, now she recalled the fact that the tea for immediate use was\r\ncorked up in a tin can and stowed away together with the teapot and\r\ncups, saucers, spoons and other concomitants, in a certain green box.\r\nBut where was the green box?  She and Judy peered among the confused\r\npiles, and at last spied it under another box, on which was a large\r\nbasket that was covered with a pile of bedding.\r\n\r\nJudy obtained the tea and tea-pot and kettle, but until that moment had\r\nneglected to order a fire; so she went to the front door to look for her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\"Peter!\" she called.  Peter was nowhere about the house.  She saw him\r\nbelow the bluff on his way to the landing.  So, running a little nearer,\r\nand raising her voice to a high musical pitch, she sung out, \"Petah-h!\r\nOH-H!  Petah!  Oh!  PEE-tah!\"\r\n\r\nPeter came, and learning what was wanted, went to the landing for his\r\nax, and having brought her a stick of green oak wood on his shoulder,\r\nsallied out once more to find some kindling.\r\n\r\nWhile he was on this business, Judy prepared to get some water.  \"Wey my\r\nbucket?\" she inquired, looking around.  \"Who tek my bucket?  I sho’\r\nsomebody moob um; fuh I put um right down yuh, under my new\r\ncalabash.\"[#]\r\n\r\n\r\n[#] \"Where is my bucket?  Who has taken my bucket?  I am sure somebody\r\nhas moved it, for I put it right down here under my new gourd.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nBut nobody had disturbed it.  Judy had set it, half full of water, on\r\nthe ground outside the door, in the snuggest place she could find; but a\r\nthirsty goat had found it, and another thirsty goat had fought for it,\r\nand between the two, it had been upset, and rolled into a corner where\r\nit lay concealed by a bundle.  By the time Judy got another supply of\r\nwater ready it was growing dark.  Peter had not made the fire because he\r\nwas not certain where she preferred to have it built; so he waited, like\r\na good, obedient husband, until she should direct him.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Mary was in trouble too.  Where was the loaf sugar to\r\nbe placed in cracking it, and what should she use for a hammer?  Then\r\nthe candle box must be opened, and candles and candle-sticks brought\r\ntogether, and some place contrived for placing them after they were\r\nlighted.\r\n\r\nBut perseverance conquers all things.  Tea _was_ made, sugar _was_\r\ncracked, and candles were both lighted and put in position.  Bed-time\r\ncame soon after, and weary enough with their labour, they all laid down\r\nto enjoy their first sleep at Bellevue.  Mary and Frank occupied a\r\npallet spread behind a pile of boxes in one room, while their father and\r\nthe older boys lay upon cloaks, and whatever else they could convert\r\ninto a temporary mattress, in the other; and the servants tumbled\r\nthemselves upon a pile of their own clothing, which they had thrown\r\nunder a shelter erected beside the house.\r\n\r\nEarly the next morning, two convenient shelters were hastily\r\nconstructed, and the two rooms of the house were so far relieved of\r\ntheir confused contents, as to allow space for sitting, and almost for\r\nwalking about.  But ere this was half accomplished, Mary, whose sense of\r\norder and propriety was very keen, was destined to be thrown into quite\r\nan embarrassing situation.\r\n\r\nMajor Burke, the commandant of Fort Brooke, was a cousin of Mrs. Gordon,\r\nand an old college friend of the Doctor, and hearing by the captain of\r\nthe brig of the arrival of the new comers, he rode over in the forenoon\r\nof the next day to see them.  Mary’s mind associated so indissolubly the\r\nidea of _company_, with the stately etiquette of Charleston and\r\nSavannah, that the sight of a well-dressed stranger approaching their\r\ndoor, threw her almost into a fever.\r\n\r\n\"Oh! father,\" she cried, as soon as she could beckon him out of the back\r\ndoor, \"what shall we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do?\" he answered, laughing.  \"Why, nothing at all. What can we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"But is he not going to dine with us?\" enquired she.\r\n\r\n\"I presume so,\" he replied.  \"I am sure I shall ask him; but what of\r\nthat?\"\r\n\r\n\"What, father, dine with us?\" she remonstrated, \"when our only table\r\nunboxed is no bigger than a light stand, and we have scarcely room for\r\nthat!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said, \"we will do the best we can for him now, and hope to do\r\nbetter some other time. Perhaps you will feel less disturbed when you\r\nrealize that he is your cousin and a soldier.  Come, let me make you\r\nacquainted with him.\"\r\n\r\nMary was naturally a neat girl, and although her hands were soiled with\r\nlabour, she was soon ready to obey her father’s invitation.  Slipping\r\ninto the back room, by a low window, she washed her hands and face, and\r\nbrushed into order the ringlets that clustered around her usually sunny\r\nface, and then came modestly into the apartment where the two gentlemen\r\nwere sitting.\r\n\r\n\"John, this is my eldest daughter, Mary,\" said the Doctor, as she\r\napproached; \"and Mary this is your cousin, Major Burke, of whom you have\r\nheard your mother and me so often speak.\"\r\n\r\nThe two cousins shook hands very cordially, and appeared to be mutually\r\npleased.\r\n\r\n\"She is my housekeeper for the present,\" her father continued, \"and has\r\nbeen in some trouble\" (here Mary looked reproachfully at him), \"that she\r\ncould not give you a more fitting reception.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, indeed,\" said the Major, with a merry twinkle of his eye, \"I\r\nsuspect that when my little cousin learns how often we soldiers are glad\r\nto sit on the bare ground, and to feed, Indian fashion, on Indian fare,\r\nshe will feel little trouble about giving us entertainment.\"\r\n\r\nMary’s embarrassment was now wholly dispelled. Her cousin was fully\r\napprised of their crowded and confused condition, and was ready to\r\npartake with good humour of whatever they could hastily prepare.\r\n\r\nThe dinner passed off far more agreeably than she supposed possible.  By\r\nher father’s direction, a dining table was unboxed and spread under the\r\nboughs of a magnificent live oak, and Judy, having ascertained where the\r\nstores were to be found, gave them not only a dinner, but a dessert to\r\nboot, which they all enjoyed with evident relish.  Ah!--black and ugly\r\nas she was, that Judy was a jewel.\r\n\r\nThe Major had come thus hastily upon them for the purpose of insisting\r\nthat the whole family should occupy quarters at the Fort as his guests,\r\nuntil the new house, intended for their future reception, should be\r\ncompleted. To this Dr. Gordon objected that his presence was necessary\r\nfor the progression of the work, but promised that at the earliest\r\nperiod when he could be spared for a few days, he would accept the\r\ninvitation and bring the young people with him.\r\n\r\nThe visitor did not take his leave until the shades of evening warned\r\nhim of the lapse of time.  Mary had become much more interested, in\r\nconsequence of her first distress and the pleasant termination, than she\r\npossibly could have been without these experiences; and as the whole\r\nfamily stood at the front door, watching his rapidly diminishing figure,\r\nshe perpetrated a blunder which gave rise to much merriment.\r\n\r\nHer father had remarked, \"It will be long after dark before he can reach\r\nthe Fort.\"\r\n\r\nMary rejoined, \"Yes, sir, but,\" looking with an abstracted air, first at\r\nthe table where they had enjoyed their pleasant repast, then at the\r\ndarkening form of the soldier, and finally at the full moon which began\r\nto pour its silver radiance over the bay, \"it will make no difference\r\ntonight, for it will be blue-eyed Mary.\"\r\n\r\nAll turned their eyes upon her in perplexity, to gather from her\r\ncountenance the interpretation of her language; but Mary was still\r\nlooking quietly at the moon.  Harold thought the girl had become\r\nsuddenly deranged.\r\n\r\nRobert, who had observed her abstraction of mind, and who suspected the\r\ntruth, began to laugh.  Her father turned to her and asked, with a tone\r\nso divided between the ludicrous and the grave, that it was hard to tell\r\nwhich predominated, \"What do you mean by ’blue-eyed Mary’?\"\r\n\r\n\"Did I say blue-eyed Mary?\" she exclaimed, reddening from her temples to\r\nher finger ends, and then giving way to a fit of laughter so hearty and\r\nso prolonged, that she could scarcely reply, \"I meant _moonlight_.\"[#]\r\n\r\n\r\n[#] It is but justice to say that this absurd mistake was _an actual\r\noccurrence_.  For many a day afterwards the members of the company\r\npresent on that occasion seldom alluded to moonlight among each other,\r\nbut by the name of \"blue-eyed Mary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was no resisting the impulse, all laughed with her, and long\r\nafterwards did it furnish a theme for merriment.  Robert, however, was\r\ndisposed to be so wicked on the occasion, that his father deemed it\r\nnecessary to stop his teasing, by turning the laugh against him.\r\n\r\n\"It is certainly,\" said he, \"the most ridiculous thing I have witnessed\r\nsince Robert’s queer prank at the prayer-meeting.\"\r\n\r\nAs soon as the word \"prayer-meeting\" was uttered, Robert’s countenance\r\nfell.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, uncle?\" inquired Harold.\r\n\r\n\"O, do tell it, father,\" begged Mary, clapping her hands with delight.\r\n\r\n\"About a year since,\" said Dr. Gordon, \"I attended a prayer-meeting in\r\nthe city of Charleston, where thirty or forty intelligent people were\r\nassembled at the house of their pastor.  It was night.  Robert occupied\r\na chair near the table, beside which the minister officiated, and where\r\nhe could be seen by every person in the room: Not long after the\r\nminister’s address began, Robert’s head was seen to nod; and every once\r\nin a while his nods were so expressive, apparently, of assent to the\r\nremarks made, as to bring a smile upon the face of more than one of the\r\ncompany.  But he was not content with nodding.  Soon his head fell back\r\nupon the chair, and he snored most musically, with his mouth wide open.\r\nIt was then nearly time for another prayer, and I was very much in hopes\r\nthat when we moved to kneel, he would be awakened by the noise.  But no\r\nsuch good fortune was in store for me.  He slept through the whole\r\nprayer; and then, to make the scene as ridiculous as possible, he awoke\r\nas the people were in the act of rising, and, supposing they were about\r\nto kneel, he deliberately knelt down beside his chair, and kept that\r\nposition until he was seen by every person present. There was a slight\r\npause in the services, I think the clergyman himself was somewhat\r\ndisconcerted, and afraid to trust his voice.  Poor Robert soon suspected\r\nhis mistake.  He peeped cautiously around, then arose and took his seat\r\nwith a very silly look.  I am glad it happened.  He has never gone to\r\nsleep in meeting since.\"\r\n\r\nAnd from that time forth Mary never heard Robert allude to her\r\nmoonlight; indeed he was so much cut down by this story, that for a day\r\nor two he was more than usually quiet.  At last, however, an incident\r\noccurred which restored to him the ascendancy he had hitherto held over\r\nhis cousin, by illustrating the importance of possessing a proper store\r\nof sound, practical knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe two had gone to examine an old well, near the house, and were\r\nspeculating upon the possibility of cleansing it from its trash and\r\nother impurities, so as to be fit for use, when Harold’s knife slipped\r\nfrom his hand and fell down the well.  It did not fall into the water,\r\nbut was caught by a half decayed board that floated on its surface.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot afford to lose that knife,\" said Harold, looking around for\r\nsomething to aid his descent, \"I must go down after it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You had better be careful how you do that,\" interposed Robert, \"it may\r\nnot be safe.\"\r\n\r\n\"What,\" asked Harold, \"are you afraid of the well’s caving?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so much of its caving,\" replied Robert, \"as of the bad air that may\r\nhave collected at the bottom.\"\r\n\r\nHarold snuffed at the well’s mouth to detect such ill odours as might be\r\nthere, and said, \"I perceive no smell.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mistake my meaning,\" remarked Robert.  \"In all old wells, vaults\r\nand places under ground, there is apt to collect a kind of air or gas,\r\nlike that which comes from burning charcoal, that will quickly suffocate\r\nany one who breathes it.  Many a person has lost his life by going into\r\nsuch a place without testing it beforehand.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you tell whether there is any of it here?\" asked Harold.\r\n\r\n\"Very easily, with a little fire,\" answered Robert. \"AIR THAT WILL NOT\r\nSUPPORT FLAME, WILL NOT SUPPORT LIFE.\"\r\n\r\nThey stuck a splinter of rich pine in the cleft end of a pole, and,\r\nlighting it by a match, let it softly down the well.  To Harold’s\r\nastonishment the flame was extinguished as suddenly as if it had been\r\ndipped in water, before it had gone half way to the bottom.\r\n\r\n\"Stop, let us try that experiment again,\" said he.\r\n\r\nThey tried it repeatedly, and with the same result, except that the\r\nheavy poisonous air below being stirred by the pole, had become somewhat\r\nmingled with the pure air above, and the flame was not extinguished\r\nquite so suddenly as at first; it burnt more and more dimly as it\r\ndescended, and then went out.\r\n\r\n\"I do believe there is something there,\" said he at last, \"and I\r\ncertainly shall not go down, as I intended. But how am I to get my\r\nknife?\"\r\n\r\n\"By using father’s magnet, which is a strong one,\" replied Robert.  \"Let\r\nus go and ask him for it.\"\r\n\r\nOn relating the circumstances to Dr. Gordon, he said, \"You have made a\r\nmost fortunate escape, Harold.  Had you descended that well, filled as\r\nit is with carbonic acid gas, you would have become suddenly sick and\r\nfaint, and would probably have fallen senseless before you could have\r\ncalled for help.  _Make it a rule never to descend such a place without\r\nfirst trying the purity of its air, as you did just now_.\"\r\n\r\n\"But can we not get that bad air out?\" asked Harold.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, by various means, and some of them very easy,\" replied his uncle.\r\n\"One is by exploding gunpowder as far down as possible; another is by\r\nlowering down and drawing up many times a thickly leaved bush, so as to\r\npump out the foul air, or at least to mix it largely with the pure.  But\r\nyour knife can be obtained without all that trouble.  Robert, can you\r\nnot put him upon a plan?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have already mentioned it, and we have come to ask if you will not\r\nlet us have your magnet,\" replied Robert.  \"But,\" continued he\r\nsmilingly, \"I do not think that we shall have any need this time for the\r\nlooking-glass.\"\r\n\r\nHarold looked from one to the other for an explanation, and his uncle\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n\"Last year Robert dropped his knife down a well, as you did, and\r\nproposed to recover it by means of a strong magnet tied to a string.\r\nBut the well was deep and very dark, and after fishing a long time in\r\nvain, he came to me for help.  I made him bring a large looking-glass\r\nfrom the house, and by means of it reflected such a body of sun-light\r\ndown the well that we could plainly see his knife at the bottom, stowed\r\naway in a corner.  The magnet was strong enough to bring it safely to\r\nthe top.  You also may try the experiment.\"\r\n\r\nWith thanks, Harold took the offered magnet, tied it to a string, and\r\nsoon recovered his knife.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nRILEY--A THUNDERSTORM--ASCERTAINING THE DISTANCE OF OBJECTS BY\r\nSOUND--SECURITY AGAINST LIGHTNING--MEANS OF RECOVERING LIFE FROM\r\nAPPARENT DEATH BY LIGHTNING\r\n\r\n\r\nA few days after this incident another visitor was seen coming from Fort\r\nBrooke.  This person was not a horseman, but some one in a boat, who\r\nseemed even from a distance to possess singular dexterity in the use of\r\nthe paddle.  His boat glided over the smooth surface of the bay as if\r\npropelled less by his exertions than by his will.  Dr. Gordon viewed him\r\nthrough the spy glass, and soon decided him to be an Indian, who was\r\nprobably bringing something to sell.\r\n\r\nIt so turned out.  He was a half-breed, by the name of Riley, who\r\nfrequently visited the fort with venison and turkeys to sell, and who on\r\nthe present occasion brought with him in addition a fine green turtle.\r\nMajor Burke, conceiving that his friends at Bellevue would prize these\r\ndelicacies more than they at the fort, to whom they were no longer\r\nrarities, had directed the Indian to bring them, with his compliments,\r\nto Dr. Gordon.\r\n\r\nRiley was a fine looking fellow, of about thirty years of age--tall,\r\nkeen-eyed, straight as an arrow, and with a pleasing open countenance.\r\nHe brought a note from the fort, recommending him for honesty and\r\nfaithfulness.\r\n\r\nDr. Gordon was so much pleased with his general appearance, that he\r\nengaged him to return the following week with another supply of game,\r\nand prepared to remain several days, in case he should be needed in\r\nraising the timbers of the new house.\r\n\r\nToward the close of the week, the weather gave indications of a change.\r\nA heavy looking cloud rose slowly from the west, and came towards them,\r\nmuttering and growling in great anger.  It was a tropical thunderstorm.\r\nThe distant growls were soon converted into peals.  The flashes\r\nincreased rapidly in number and intensity, and became terrific.  Mary\r\nand Frank nestled close to their father; and even stout-hearted Harold\r\nlooked grave, as though he did not feel quite so comfortable as usual.\r\n\r\n\"That flash was uncommonly keen,\" Robert remarked, with an unsteady\r\nvoice.  \"Do you not think, father, it was very near?\"\r\n\r\nInstead of replying, his father appeared to be busy counting; and when\r\nthe crash of thunder was heard, jarring their ears, and making the earth\r\nquiver, he replied,\r\n\r\n\"Not very.  Certainly not within a mile.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, uncle, can you calculate the distance of the lightning?\" Harold\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"Unquestionably, or I should not have spoken with so much confidence.\r\nRobert imagined, as most people do, that a flash is near in proportion\r\nto its brightness; but that is no criterion.  You must calculate its\r\ndistance by the time which elapses between the flash and the report.\r\nSound travels at the rate of about a mile in five seconds.  Should any\r\nof you like to calculate the distance of the next flash, put your finger\r\non your pulse, and count the number of beats before you hear the\r\nthunder.\"\r\n\r\nAn opportunity soon occurred.  A vivid flash was followed after a few\r\nseconds by a roll, and then by a peal of thunder.  All were busy\r\ncounting their pulses. Mary ceased when she heard the first roll,\r\nexclaiming \"Five!\"  The others held on until they heard the loud report,\r\nand said \"Seven.\"  Dr. Gordon reported only six beats of his own pulse,\r\nremarking,\r\n\r\n\"That flash discharged itself just one mile distant. Our pulses are\r\nquicker than seconds; and yours quicker than mine.  Sound will travel a\r\nmile during six beats of a person of my age, and during seven of persons\r\nof yours.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, father,\" argued Mary, \"I surely heard the thunder rolling when I\r\nsaid _five_.\"\r\n\r\n\"So did I,\" he answered; \"and that proves that although the lightning\r\ndischarged itself upon the earth at the distance of a mile, it\r\n_commenced_ to flow from a point nearer overhead.\"\r\n\r\nThe young people were so deeply interested in these calculations, that\r\nthey felt less keenly than they could have imagined possible the\r\ndiscomfort of the storm. This was Dr. Gordon’s intention.  But at last\r\nMary and Frank winced so uneasily, when flashes of unusual brightness\r\nappeared, that their father remarked, \"It is a weakness, my children, to\r\nbe afraid of lightning that is seen and of thunder that is heard--_they\r\nare spent and gone_.  Persons never see the flash that kills them--it\r\ndoes its work before they can see, hear, or feel.\"\r\n\r\nAt this instant came a flash so keen, that it seemed to blaze into their\r\nvery eyes, and almost simultaneously came a report like the discharge of\r\na cannon.  Dr. Gordon’s lecture was in vain; all except him and Harold\r\nstarted to their feet.  Frank ran screaming to his father. Mary rushed\r\nto a pile of bedding, and covered herself with the bed-clothing.  Robert\r\nlooked at Mary’s refuge, with a manifest desire to seek a place beside\r\nher.  Harold fixed his eye upon his uncle, with a glance of keen\r\ninquiry.\r\n\r\n\"This is becoming serious,\" said the Doctor anxiously. \"Something on the\r\npremises has been struck.  Stay here, children, while I look after the\r\nservants.  _Your safest place is in the middle of the room_, as far as\r\npossible from the chimney and walls, along which the lightning passes.\"\r\n\r\nWhile giving these directions, at the same time that he seized his hat,\r\ncloak, and umbrella, William rushed in to say that the horses had been\r\nstruck down and killed.  They were stabled under a shelter erected near\r\na tall palmetto--a tree so seldom struck by lightning, as to be regarded\r\nby the Indians as exempt from danger. The fluid had descended the trunk,\r\ntearing a great hole in the ground, and jarring down a part of the loose\r\nenclosure.\r\n\r\n\"Call all hands!\" said the Doctor.  \"Throw off the shelter instantly, to\r\nlet the rain pour upon them; and bring also your buckets and pails.\"\r\n\r\nOn his going out, the children crowded to the door, to see, if possible,\r\nthe damage that was done; but he waved them all back, with the\r\ninformation that during a thunder storm an open door or window is one of\r\nthe most dangerous places about a house.  They quickly retired; Mary and\r\nFrank going to the bed, Robert taking a chair to the middle of the room,\r\nand drawing up his feet from the floor.  Harold’s remark was\r\ncharacteristic. \"I wish uncle would let me help with the horses.  I am\r\nsure that that is the safest place in this neighbourhood; for I never\r\nsaw lightning strike twice on the same spot.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the horses was speedily revived by the falling rain.  He\r\nstaggered to his feet, then moved painfully away, smelling at his hoofs,\r\nto ascertain what ailed them. The other continued for an hour or more,\r\nto all appearance, dead.  The servants dipped buckets and pails full of\r\nwater from pools made by the rain, and poured them upon the lifeless\r\nbody, until it was perfectly drenched. They had given up all hope of a\r\nrestoration.  William’s eyes looked watery (for he was the coachman) and\r\nhe heaved a sorrowful sigh over his brute companion. \"Poor Tom!\" he\r\nsaid, \"what will Jerry do now for a mate?\"  Another half hour passed\r\nwithout any sign of returning life; and even William would have ceased\r\nhis efforts, had it not been for his master’s decided \"Pour on water!\r\nKeep pouring!\"\r\n\r\nAt last there appeared a slight twitching in one of the legs.  Poor Tom\r\nwas not dead after all.  William gave a \"Hurra boys! he’s coming to,\" in\r\nwhich the others joined with unfeigned delight.  \"Now, William,\" said\r\nhis master, \"do you and Sam take the strips of blanket that you rub\r\nwith, and see if you cannot start his blood to flowing more rapidly.\r\nTom will soon open his eyes.\"\r\n\r\nTwo of the servants continued to pour on water, the others to rub\r\nviolently the head, neck, legs and body. The reviving brute moved first\r\none foreleg, then the other, while the hinder legs were yet paralysed.\r\nThen he opened his eyes, raised his head, and made an effort to turn\r\nhimself.  As soon as he was able to swallow, Dr. Gordon ordered a drench\r\nof camphorated spirit, and left him with directions to the servants.\r\n\"Listen all of you.  I have shown you how to treat a horse struck down\r\nby lightning.  Do you treat a person in the same way. Pour on water by\r\nthe bucket full, until he gives some signs of life; then rub him hard,\r\nand give him some heating drink.  _Don’t give up trying for half a\r\nday_.\"\r\n\r\nThe storm passed over.  Tom and Jerry were once more united under the\r\nskilful management of William, who frequently boasted that \"they were\r\nthe toughest creatures in creation, even lightning could not kill them.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ONLY WAY TO STUDY--TAKING COLD--RILEY’S FAMILY--THE HARE\r\nLIP---FISHING FOR SHEEPHEAD---FRANK CHOKED WITH A FISH BONE--HIS\r\nRELIEF--HIS STORY OF THE SHEEP’S HEAD AND DUMPLINGS--\"TILL THE WARFARE\r\nIS OVER\"\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Gordon began to feel dissatisfied that his children were losing so\r\nmuch valuable time from study; for the house was yet loaded with baggage\r\nwhich could be put nowhere else, and their time was broken up by\r\nunavoidable interruptions. Until a more favourable opportunity,\r\ntherefore, he required only that they should devote one hour every day\r\nto faithful study, and that they should spend the rest of their time as\r\nusefully as possible.\r\n\r\nHis theory of education embraced two very simple, but very efficacious\r\nprinciples.  First, to _excite in his children the desire of acquiring\r\nknowledge_; and, secondly, to train them to _give their undivided\r\nattention to the subject in hand_.  This last, he said, was the only way\r\nto study; and he told them, in illustration, the story of Sir Isaac\r\nNewton, who, on being asked by a friend, in view of his prodigious\r\nachievements, what was the difference, so far as he was conscious,\r\nbetween his mind and those of ordinary people, answered simply in the\r\npower of concentration.\r\n\r\nHarold had been greatly discouraged at finding himself so far behind his\r\ncousins in the art of study, but by following the advice of his uncle,\r\nhe soon experienced a great and an encouraging change.  At first, it is\r\ntrue, he could scarcely give his whole mind to any study more than five\r\nminutes at a time, without a sense of weariness; but he persevered, and\r\nday by day his powers increased so manifestly that he used frequently to\r\nsay to himself, \"_concentration is everything--everything in study_.\"\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Gordon’s instructions were by no means confined to books and the\r\nschool-room; he used every favourable opportunity to give information on\r\npoints that promised to be useful.\r\n\r\n\"Mary,\" said he one day, to his daughter, who was sitting absorbed in\r\nstudy, beside a window through which the sea breeze was pouring freshly\r\nupon her head and shoulders, and who had, in consequence, began to\r\nexhibit symptoms of a cold, \"Mary, my daughter, remove your seat.  Do\r\nyou not know that to allow a current of air like that to blow upon a\r\npart of your person, is almost sure to produce sickness?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know it, father,\" she replied, \"and I intended some time since to\r\nchange my seat, but the sum is so hard that I forgot all about the\r\nwind.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to see you capable of such fixedness of mind,\" said he, \"but\r\nI will take this opportunity to say to you, and to the rest, that there\r\nare two seasons, especially, when you should be on your guard against\r\nthese dangerous currents of air,--one is when you are asleep, and the\r\nother is when your mind is absorbed in thought.  At these times the\r\npores of the skin are more than usually open, as may be seen by the flow\r\nof perspiration; and a current of cool air, at such a time, especially\r\nif partial, is almost certain to give cold.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how can we be on our guard, father,\" asked Mary with a smile, \"when\r\nwe are too far gone in sleep or in thought, to know what we are about!\"\r\n\r\n\"We must take the precaution beforehand,\" he replied.  \"Make it a rule\r\nnever to sleep nor to study in a partial current of air; and also\r\nremember that _the first moment_ you perceive the tingling sensation of\r\nan incipient cold, you must obey the warning which kind nature gives you\r\nor else must bear the consequences.\"\r\n\r\nMary’s cold was pretty severe.  For days she suffered from cough and\r\npain.  But that day’s lecture on currents of air, followed by so\r\nimpressive an illustration, was probably more useful than her lesson in\r\narithmetic; certainly it was longer remembered and more frequently acted\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nTrue to his promise, Riley appeared at the appointed time with his\r\nsupply of game.  He said, however, that he should remain only a few\r\ndays, because he had left his young wife sick.  It interested Mary not a\r\nlittle to perceive that a savage could feel and act so much like a\r\ncivilized being; and she was trying to think of something complimentary\r\nto say upon this occasion, when he threw her all aback, by adding, that\r\nthis was his _youngest_ and _favourite_ wife.\r\n\r\n\"What! have you two wives?\" she exclaimed in horror.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, only two, now; one dead.\"\r\n\r\nHer mind was sadly changed at this evidence of heathenism; but ere the\r\nday was over she received a still more impressive proof.\r\n\r\nDr. Gordon perceiving that he looked sad whenever an allusion was made\r\nto his home, he asked him if his wife was seriously sick, to which he\r\nanswered, No.\r\n\r\n\"When I go home, last week,\" said he, \"my squaw had a fine boy, big and\r\nfat.  My heart glad.  But I look and see a big hole in his mouth, from\r\nhere to here,\" pointing from the lip to the nose.\r\n\r\n\"That is what we call a hare lip,\" said Dr. Gordon, \"it is not\r\nuncommon.\"\r\n\r\n\"I sorry very much,\" continued Riley.  \"Child too ugly.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it can be easily cured,\" observed Dr. Gordon.\r\n\r\nRiley looked at him inquiringly, and Dr. Gordon added, \"O, yes, it can\r\nbe easily cured.  If you will bring your child here, any time, I will\r\nstop that hole in half an hour; and there will be no sign of it left,\r\nexcept a little scar, like a cut.\"\r\n\r\nThe Indian shook his head mournfully, \"Can’t bring him.  Too late now.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, the child is dead?\" inquired the Doctor.  \"I am sorry.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dead now,\" replied Riley.  \"I look at him one day, two day, tree day.\r\nChild too ugly.  I throw him in the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" exclaimed Dr. Gordon, suddenly remembering that it was the\r\npractice of the Indians to destroy all their deformed children.  \"You\r\ndid not drown it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Child ugly too much,\" answered Riley, with a softened tone of voice.\r\n\"Child good for nothing.  I throw him in the water.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Gordon was not only shocked, as any man of feeling would have been,\r\nunder the circumstances, but he felt as a Christian, whose heart moved\r\nwith compassion towards his dark skinned brother.  He uttered not one\r\nword of rebuke or of condemnation; his time for speaking to the purpose\r\nhad not yet come; and he carefully avoided everything in word and look\r\nwhich should widen the space which naturally exists between the white\r\nman and the Indian, the Christian and the pagan.\r\n\r\nPoor Mary!  She no sooner heard this confession, than she sidled away\r\nfrom her interesting savage, until wholly beyond his reach, and could\r\nscarcely look at him during his stay that week, without feelings akin to\r\nfear.  An Indian, she learned, was an Indian after all.\r\n\r\nWhile Riley was there the boys often borrowed his boat, and Harold tried\r\nto imitate his dexterity in the use of the paddle.  They soon became\r\ngreat friends.  On one of their excursions for fish, they went, by his\r\ndirection, around a point of land where the head of a fallen live oak\r\nlay in the water, and its partially decayed limbs were encrusted with\r\nbarnacles and young oysters. There they soon caught a large supply of\r\nvery fine fish of various sorts, particularly of the sheephead,--a\r\ndelicious fish, shaped somewhat like the perch, only stouter and\r\nrounder, beautifully marked with broad alternate bands of black and\r\nwhite around the body, and varying in weight from half a pound to ten or\r\nfifteen pounds.\r\n\r\nNo one was more delighted than Frank, with the result of the excursion;\r\nfor he was fond, as a cat, of everything in the shape of fish.  But, it\r\nis said, there is no rose without its thorn; and so he found in the\r\npresent case.  He was enjoying, rather voraciously, the luxury of his\r\nfavourite food, when a disorderly bone lodged crossways in the narrow\r\npart of his throat, and gave him excessive pain.  Frank was a polite\r\nboy.  Avoiding, as far as possible, disturbing the others by his\r\nmisfortune, he slipped quietly from the table, and tried every means to\r\nrelieve himself.  But it was not until he had applied to his father,\r\nand, under his direction, swallowed a piece of hard bread, that he was\r\nable to resume his place.[#]\r\n\r\n\r\n[#] Unwilling to mislead any of my young readers, by describing\r\nexpedients and remedies that might not serve them in case of necessity,\r\nI have submitted my manuscript to several persons for inspection, and\r\namong others to a judicious physician and surgeon.  It never occurred to\r\nme that in mentioning so simple a thing as swallowing a crust for the\r\nremoval of a fish-bone, I could possibly do harm.  To my surprise,\r\nhowever, my medical friend observed, that he supposed Dr. Gordon knew\r\nthat the fishbone, which Frank swallowed, was _small_ and _flexible_, or\r\nhe would not have used that expedient.\r\n\r\n\"If,\" said he, \"the substance which lodges in the throat is so stiff (a\r\npin for instance) as not to be easily bent, the attempt to force it down\r\nby swallowing a piece of bread may be unsafe; it may lacerate the lining\r\nmembrane, or, being stopped by the offending substance, it may cause the\r\nperson to be worse choked than before.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Doctor, what should the poor fellow do in such a case?\" he was\r\nasked.\r\n\r\n\"I suspect Dr. Gordon would have used a large feather?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he would have rumpled its plume, so as to reverse the direction of\r\nthe feathery part, and would have thrust that down the throat, below the\r\npin or bone.  On withdrawing the feather, the substance would be either\r\nfound adhering to its wet sides, or raised on end, so that it could be\r\neasily swallowed.\"\r\n\r\nWith many thanks for this suggestion, the promise was made that the\r\nyoung readers of Robert and Harold should have the benefit of his\r\nadvice.  But I think that the best plan is to avoid the fish-bones.\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing not quite so humble as he was polite, however, he began to condemn\r\nthe fish instead of himself for his accident.  His father told him he\r\nhad no right to say one word against the fish, which was remarkably free\r\nfrom bones, and was just preparing to give him a gentle lecture on\r\ngormandizing, when Frank, foreseeing what was to come, was adroit enough\r\nto seize a moment’s pause in the conversation, and to divert the\r\nsubject, by asking with a very droll air,\r\n\r\n\"I wonder, father, if these sheephead are of the same kind with that one\r\nthat butted the dumplings?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know what dumplings you mean,\" said his father.\r\n\r\n\"O, did you never hear the story of the sheep’s head and the dumplings?\r\nWell, brother Robert can tell you all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" returned his father, who saw through the little fellow’s\r\nstratagem.  \"No, no, Frank, it is your own story, and you must go\r\nthrough with it.\"\r\n\r\nThis was a trial, for Frank had never in his life made so long an\r\nextempore speech in the presence of the assembled family, as he had now\r\nimposed upon himself. But, in the desperation of the moment, he mustered\r\ncourage, and thus spoke,\r\n\r\n\"There was once an old woman that left her little boy to mind a pot that\r\nhad in it a sheep’s head and some dumplings boiling for dinner, while\r\nshe went to a neighbour’s house to attend some sort of preaching. The\r\nlittle boy did not seem to have much sense; and had never minded a pot\r\nbefore; so when he saw the water boiling over, and the sheep’s head and\r\nthe dumplings bobbing about in every direction, he became frightened and\r\nran for his mother, bawling at the top of his voice, ’Mammy! the\r\ndumplings! run!’  She saw him coming in among the people, and tried to\r\nstop his bawling by shaking her head and winking her eyes at him; but he\r\nwould not stop.  He crowded right up to her, saying, ’Mammy, you needn’t\r\nto wink nor to blink, for the sheep’s head is butting all the dumplings\r\nout of the pot!’\"\r\n\r\nThroughout this story Frank did not make a balk or a blunder.  He kept\r\nstraight on, as if brimful of fun, and uttered the last sentence with\r\nsuch an affectation of grave terror, as produced a universal laugh.\r\n\r\nHis father had tried hard to keep up his dignity for the intended\r\nlecture, but it also gave way, and he contented himself with saying,\r\n\r\n\"Well, master Frank, I see you are at your old tricks again.  And since\r\nyou show such an aptitude for putting people into good humour, there\r\nwill be reason to think you are in fault, if you ever put them out.\r\nHarold, has your aunt ever told you how Frank once _kissed himself out\r\nof a scrape with her_?\"\r\n\r\nHarold said she had not, and his uncle went on,\r\n\r\n\"It was when he was between three and four years of age.  His mother had\r\ntaken him on a visit to a friend of hers in the neighbourhood of\r\nCharleston, and he was allowed to sit at the dinner table with the\r\nladies. But he became so disorderly and perverse that his mother, after\r\nan ineffectual reprimand or two, ordered him to go up stairs, meaning to\r\nher room above.  The language was indefinite, and Frank interpreted it\r\nto suit his own pleasure.  He went up stairs, it is true, but only half\r\nway, where he seated himself so as to look at the table and the company,\r\nand then began to drum with his feet and to talk loud enough to be\r\nheard,\r\n\r\n\"’H-m-n-h!  This is a very good place.  I love these nice stairs.  I’d\r\nrather be here than anywhere else in the world.  I don’t want any of\r\nthat old dinner!’\r\n\r\n\"This was very rude language, and more especially when used in a house\r\nwhere he was a guest.  His mother was so much mortified that as soon as\r\ndinner was over she took him to her room, gave him a sound strapping,\r\nand put him in a corner, where he was to stay, until he promised to be a\r\ngood boy.  Then she lay down on her bed as if to take a nap, but in\r\nreality to meditate what course to pursue towards her rude little child.\r\n\r\n\"Frank, you know, is fond of singing.  There was a wild religious melody\r\nwhich he had learnt about that time, and which he was constantly\r\nsinging.  It had a short chorus at the end of every line, and a long\r\nchorus at the end of each verse, running this way,\r\n\r\n\"’Children of the heavenly King,\r\n  Till the warfare is over, Hallelujah,\r\nAs ye journey sweetly sing,\r\n  Till the warfare is over, Hallelujah.’\r\n\r\nI forget the long chorus.\r\n\r\n\"Well, your aunt had not been upon the bed more than a few minutes,\r\nbefore Frank quietly slipped from his corner and stole close to the\r\nbedside to make friends. But his mother would not notice him.  He bent\r\nover and gave her a kiss.  Still she looked displeased.  He tried\r\nanother kiss, but she turned away her face.  This was a damper.  Frank\r\nwas disheartened, but not in despair. He leaned over the bed, making a\r\nlong reach, to try the effect of a third kiss.\r\n\r\n\"’There, Frank,’ said his mother, in a displeased tone, ’that is enough.\r\nYou need not kiss me any more.’\r\n\r\n\"’Yes, mother,’ said he, leaning far over, and taking hold of her, ’I\r\nmean to kiss you _till the warfare is over, Hallelujah_.’\r\n\r\n\"I need not say that, from that moment, the warfare _was_ over, and\r\nFrank behaved himself well through the remainder of the visit.\r\n\r\n\"And now, since he has managed to escape the lecture I was about to give\r\nhim on eating too fast, I hope he will hereafter cultivate the\r\nrecollection of _today and the fish-bones_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nBUG IN THE BAR--VISIT TO PORT BROOKE--EVADING BLOODHOUNDS--CONTEST WITH\r\nDOGS AND MEANS OF DEFENCE--AMUSING ESCAPE FROM A WILD BULL AND\r\nCONVERSATION ON THE SUBJECT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Riley was at Bellevue the workmen succeeded in raising the frame\r\nof the new house, and in completing the most laborious part of the work.\r\nOn the last days of his stay he was dispatched with a message to Fort\r\nBrooke, to say that on the following Tuesday Dr. Gordon and family would\r\nmake their promised visit.\r\n\r\nDuring the interval nothing of special interest occurred, except a\r\npainful accident that happened to Harold.  He was awakened in the night\r\nby a sudden tickling in his ear.  This was caused by a harvest bug--a\r\nblack hard-winged insect, nearly an inch long.  When first feeling it,\r\nand uncertain what it was, he sprang up in bed, and struck the ear\r\nviolently from behind, in the hope of jarring it out.  Failing in this,\r\nhe poured his ear full of water; but still not succeeding, he felt along\r\nthe wall for a large needle he recollected seeing there the evening\r\nbefore, and with that endeavoured to pick it out.  The frightened bug\r\nfinding itself so energetically pursued into its unnatural hiding place,\r\nwent deeper, and began to scratch with its clogged feet, and to bite\r\nupon the tender drum of the ear.  The pain it caused was excruciating.\r\nHarold, feeling that he must soon go into spasms, unless relieved,\r\nwakened his uncle, and entreated earnestly for help.  To his\r\ninexpressible delight Dr. Gordon said he could relieve him in a minute;\r\nand seizing the night lamp he poured the ear full of oil.  Scarcely had\r\nthis fluid closed around the intruder, before it scrambled out, and\r\nreached the external ear just in time to die.\r\n\r\nHarold could not find words for his gratitude.\r\n\r\n\"Uncle,\" said he, \"you may think me extravagant, but I assure you the\r\npain was so intense, that I was thinking seriously, in case you could\r\nnot relieve me, of making Sam chop my ear open with a hatchet.  This I\r\nsuppose would have killed me; but it must have been death in either\r\ncase.\"\r\n\r\nOn the day appointed, they went to Fort Brooke in the pleasure boat, Dr.\r\nGordon being at the helm, and Robert and Harold taking turns in managing\r\nthe sails. The wind was fair, and the light ripple of the water was\r\nbarely sufficient to give a graceful dancing to their beautiful craft.\r\nFar below the transparent waves, they could see the glistening of bright\r\nshells upon the bottom, and every now and then the flash of a\r\nsilver-sided fish.\r\n\r\nAt the fort they were received with the courtesy that so generally marks\r\ngentlemen of the army; and the three days of their stay passed off very\r\npleasantly.  The reveille and tattoo, the daily drill, and the\r\npractising with cannon, were novelties to the young back-woodsmen. Frank\r\nwas exceedingly surprised, as well as amused, to see cannon-balls making\r\n\"ducks and drakes,\" as he called them, upon the water.  He had often\r\nthrown oyster-shells, and flat stones, so as to skim in this way, but he\r\nhad no idea that it could be done with a cannon-ball.\r\n\r\nOn the last day of their visit, Harold escaped from an unpleasant\r\npredicament, only by the exercise of cool courage and ready ingenuity.\r\nHe had gone with Frank to visit a cannon target, a mile or more distant.\r\nWandering along the bank of the Hillsborough river, which flows hard by\r\nthe fort, and then entering the woods on the other side of the road, he\r\nwas suddenly accosted by a man on horseback, who had been concealed\r\nbehind a bower of yellow jessamines.\r\n\r\n\"Good day, my young friend.  Have you been walking much in these woods\r\ntoday?\"\r\n\r\nHarold said that he had not, and inquired why the question was asked.\r\nThe man replied, \"I am watching for a villainous Indian-negro, who was\r\nseen skulking here this morning.  He has been detected in stealing, and\r\nseveral persons will soon come with blood-hounds to hunt him.  If you\r\nsee his track\" (and he described its peculiarity), \"I hope you will let\r\nus know.\"\r\n\r\nHarold consented to do so, and walked on, unwilling to be the spectator\r\nof the scene.  Returning to the road, and walking some distance, the\r\nthought flashed into his mind that possibly the dogs might fall upon his\r\nown trail.  It was certain that they would naturally take the freshest\r\ntrail, and he was confident that the man did not know which way he went.\r\nThe dogs were probably fierce, and it would be exceedingly difficult, in\r\ncase of an attack, to defend himself and Frank too.  Becoming every\r\nmoment more uneasy, he went to the roadside and cut himself a stout\r\nbludgeon.  Frank watched the operation, and suspected that something was\r\nwrong, though he could not conjecture what.\r\n\r\n\"Cousin,\" said he, \"what did you cut that big stick for?\"\r\n\r\n\"A walking-stick,\" he replied: \"Is it not a good one?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, pretty good; but I never saw you use a walking-stick before.\"\r\n\r\nAt that moment, Harold heard afar off the deep bay of the blood-hounds,\r\nopening upon a trail.  The sound became every moment more distinct.  He\r\ncould distinguish the cry of four separate dogs.  They were evidently\r\nupon his scent.  He clutched his club, and looked fiercely back.  It was\r\na full half mile to the place where, having left the man, he emerged\r\ninto the road; and there were several curves in it so great that he\r\ncould neither see nor be seen for any distance.  Necessity is the mother\r\nof invention.  A bright thought came into his mind.  \"Stay here,\" said\r\nhe to Frank, \"and don’t move one peg till I come back.\"\r\n\r\nHe was at a sharp bend of the road, on the convex side of which lay a\r\nlittle run of water, skirted by a thick undergrowth.  He took a course\r\nstraight with the road, and hurrying as fast as possible into the wet\r\nlow ground, returned upon his own track; then, taking Frank in his arms,\r\nsprang with all his might, at right angles, to his former course, and\r\nran with him to a neighbouring knoll, which commanded a view of the\r\nroad, where he stopped to reconnoitre.  He had _doubled_, as hunters\r\nterm this manoeuvre, practised by hares and foxes when pursued by\r\nhounds; and his intention was, if still pursued, to place Frank in a\r\ntree, and with his club to beat off the dogs until the hunters arrived.\r\n\r\nIt was soon proved that the hounds were actually upon his track.  They\r\ncame roaring along the road, with their tails raised, and their noses to\r\nthe ground.  Arriving at the spot where Frank had stood, they did not\r\npursue the road, but plunged into the bushes, upon the track which\r\nHarold had doubled, and went floundering into the mire of the stream\r\nbeyond, where they soon scattered in every direction, hunting for the\r\nlost trail.  The boys did not pursue their walk; having made so narrow\r\nan escape, they turned their steps, without delay, towards the fort.\r\n\r\n\"Cousin,\" inquired Frank, on their way back, \"did not those dogs come\r\nupon our track!\"  Harold replied, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did you cut that big stick to fight them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did you intend to cheat them by going into the bushes, and coming\r\nback the same way, and then jumping off, with me in your arms?\"  Harold\r\nstill said, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, now, cousin,\" inquired Frank, \"where did you learn that nice\r\ntrick?\"\r\n\r\n\"From the rabbits and foxes,\" he answered.  \"I did not know who could\r\ntell me better than they, how to escape from dogs.\"\r\n\r\nFrank said he always knew that foxes were very cunning, but he never\r\nbefore heard of any one’s taking a fox for his teacher.\r\n\r\nOn returning to the fort, Dr. Gordon applauded the ruse, and\r\ncongratulated Harold upon his escape; but, at the same time, informed\r\nhim that his plan was not to be relied upon.  \"A well trained hound,\"\r\nsaid he, \"is as competent to nose out a doubled track as you are to\r\ndevise it.  I attribute your escape, partly to the fact that the dogs\r\nare not staunch, and partly to the help afforded you by the miry bottom,\r\non which your scent could not lie.\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation now turned naturally upon contests with dogs, and\r\ndifferent methods of escape.  Dr. Gordon related the story of his having\r\ndefended himself and his little brother against three fierce dogs, when\r\nhe was about Robert’s age, by putting his back against a wall, and\r\nbeating off the assailants with a club.\r\n\r\n\"But were you ever forced to fight them when you had no stick?\" asked\r\nHarold.\r\n\r\n\"Fortunately not,\" his uncle replied.  \"Though I knew a person once who\r\nwas caught as you describe, and who devised at least a show of defence.\r\nHe took off his hat and shoved it at the dog, with a fierce look,\r\nwhenever it approached.  But I presume that his success depended more\r\nupon the expression of his countenance than upon the threatening\r\nappearance of his weapon.  A _fearless eye_ and _a quiet resolute\r\nmanner_, is the best defence against _any enemy_, human or brute, that\r\ncan be devised.\r\n\r\n\"I did, however, witness one expedient adopted by a sailor, which goes\r\nto show what can be accomplished in an emergency of the kind, by a cool\r\nhead and a steady hand.  A large dog rushed at him, without provocation,\r\non the public wharf.  The sailor spoke to him, looked at him, shoved his\r\nhat at him, but in vain.  The dog flew at his legs.  Quietly drawing his\r\nknife, as a last resource, and holding his hat in his left hand, he\r\nstooped, and allowing the dog to seize his hat, passed his knife\r\nunderneath it, into his throat.  The dog staggered back, mortally\r\nwounded, not having seen the hand that slew him.\"\r\n\r\nOn Friday, September 24th, the company returned to Bellevue; and on the\r\nweek following, had the opportunity of witnessing an act of cool\r\ncourage, which Harold declared to evince far more ingenuity and\r\ncomposure of mind, than his own escape from the blood-hounds.\r\n\r\nRiley had made them another visit, and was engaged at work upon the\r\nhouse, under the direction of Sam, the carpenter.  Dr. Gordon took the\r\nyoung people in the pleasure boat, to spend an afternoon in the\r\nagreeable occupation of obtaining another supply of fish.  After trying\r\nfor some time, with poor success, they saw Riley coming along the bluff;\r\nhis object being, as was afterwards shown, to point out the reason of\r\ntheir failure, and to tell them what to do.\r\n\r\nAs he approached, a fierce looking bull rushed from a grove of live\r\noaks, and made furiously at him.  Had Riley been near the shore he\r\nmight, and probably would, have sprung into the water, and thus escaped;\r\nbut the enraged beast was between him and his place of refuge. The\r\ncompany in the boat felt seriously anxious for his safety, since there\r\nappeared little chance of his escaping without a contest.  But Riley\r\ntook the matter very coolly. He glided to a little clump of saplings,\r\nand holding to one of them at arm’s length, seemed to enjoy the evident\r\nmortification of the bull in being so narrowly dodged. He was very\r\nexpert in keeping the small tree between him and it; and as the circle\r\nin which he ran was much smaller than that in which the bull was\r\ncompelled to move, his task was easy.  The furious animal pushed first\r\nwith one horn then with the other; he ran suddenly and violently; he\r\npawed the earth, and bellowed with rage; his eyes flashed and his mouth\r\nfoamed, but it was in vain.  Soon Riley watched his opportunity, and\r\nglided nimbly from that tree to one nearer the boat; then to another and\r\nanother; the bull following with every demonstration of impotent rage.\r\nThis was done merely to teaze.  Finally becoming wearied with this\r\nprofitless, though amusing sport, he gathered a handful of sand, and\r\nprovoking the bull to push at him again, forced a part of the sand into\r\none eye, and the remainder into the other, and then left him perfectly\r\nblinded for the time, and rushing madly from place to place, while Riley\r\ncame laughing to the beach, and delivered his message.\r\n\r\n\"Coolly and cleverly done!\" said Dr. Gordon, at the end of the contest.\r\n\"That is certainly a new idea, in the way of involuntary bull baiting,\r\nwhich is worth remembering.  But I advise you young folks not to try it,\r\nexcept in case of a similar necessity.  It is safer to climb a tree or\r\nfence, or even to plunge into the water.\"\r\n\r\n\"Riley had no other chance,\" remarked Harold.\r\n\r\n\"He had not,\" Dr. Gordon rejoined, \"and therefore I regard his expedient\r\nas valuable.  Should you be pursued in an open field, the danger would\r\nbe still greater. Then the best plan would be to _detain_ the beast by\r\nsomething thrown to attract his attention.  Cattle are made very quickly\r\nangry by the sight of a red garment.  If anything of this colour, such\r\nas a shawl or pocket handkerchief can be dropped when you are pursued by\r\none, it will be almost certain to catch his eye, and to engage him\r\nawhile in goring it.  If nothing red can be dropped, then let him have\r\nsomething else from your person--a hat, coat, or a spread umbrella--in\r\nfact anything calculated to attract his eye.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have heard,\" observed Robert, \"of jumping upon a bull’s back, as he\r\nstooped his head to toss.\"\r\n\r\n\"So have I,\" his father added, \"but spare me if you please, the\r\nnecessity; none but a monkey, or a person of a monkey’s agility can do\r\nit successfully.  I should sooner risk the chance of springing suddenly\r\nbehind him, and seizing his tail.  At least I should like to administer\r\nthat sound belabouring with a stick which he would so richly deserve,\r\nand which might teach him better manners.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or to twist his tail,\" said Harold merrily.  \"I believe that will make\r\na bull bellow, as soon as putting sand into his eyes.  And what is\r\nbetter, you can keep on twisting, until you are sure than his manners\r\nare thoroughly taught.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMAROONING AND THE MAROONING PARTY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe work of house-building and improvement now went forward with visible\r\nrapidity.  By the first day of October, the new dwelling-house was\r\nsufficiently advanced to allow the family to move into it; and in a\r\nfortnight more, the new kitchen was covered, and such other changes\r\nmade, in and about the house, as to give it quite a genteel and\r\ncomfortable appearance.  As it became necessary about this time for the\r\nworkmen to attend to some inside work, which could be more easily\r\naccomplished by having the family out of the way, Dr. Gordon stopped the\r\nyoung people after school, and said to them:\r\n\r\n\"Children, I have a proposition to make.  But before doing so, who can\r\ntell me what ’marooning’ means?\"\r\n\r\nAll turned their eyes to Robert, whom they regarded as a sort of walking\r\ndictionary; and he answered with a slight hesitation--\"I should say,\r\nliving pretty much in the way we have lived most of the time since we\r\ncame to Bellevue.  A person maroons when he lives in an unsettled\r\nstate.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are nearly right; but to be more critical.  The word ’maroon’ is of\r\nWest Indian origin--coming I think from the island of Jamaica.  It meant\r\nat first a free negro.  But as those who ran away from their masters\r\nbecame virtually free for the time, it came afterwards to mean a runaway\r\nnegro.  To maroon therefore means to go from home and live like a\r\nrunaway negro.  I wish to ask if any one present is in favour of\r\nmarooning?\"\r\n\r\nAll were silent, and Dr. Gordon continued, \"To maroon means also to go\r\nto some wild place, where there is plenty of game or fish, and to live\r\nupon what we can obtain by our own skill.  Are there any persons now in\r\nfavour of marooning?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am--and I--and I!\" was the universal response. \"When shall it be?\r\nWhere shall it be?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are too fast,\" said the Doctor.  \"I have one of two propositions to\r\nmake.  We must for a few days give up the house to the workmen.  Now the\r\nquestion to be decided is, Shall we return to Fort Brooke, and spend our\r\ntime among the guns and cannons; or shall we go to Riley’s Island at the\r\nmouth of the bay, and spend it among the deer and turkeys, the fish and\r\noysters, of which we have heard so much?  There are advantages and\r\ndisadvantages on both sides; and my own mind is so perfectly balanced\r\nthat I will leave the decision to you.\"\r\n\r\nHarold’s eyes flashed fire at the prospect of his old employment; still\r\nhe said nothing; he waited to know what the others preferred.  Robert\r\nlooked at him, and in a moment caught the contagion.  Indeed it seemed\r\nas if a sort of mesmeric influence had swayed the whole party, for they\r\ndid nothing more than exchange with each other one hurried glance, and\r\nthen unanimously cried out, \"Riley’s Island!  Riley’s Island!\"\r\n\r\n\"Remember,\" said Dr. Gordon, \"that in marooning we must wait upon\r\nourselves.  William is the only servant I can take.  His time will be\r\nfully occupied with cooking, and other duties belonging to the tent.  We\r\ncannot depend on him for anything more than is absolutely necessary.\r\nAre you still of the same mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"The same!\" they all replied.\r\n\r\n\"Still I will not hold you to your promises until you have had further\r\ntime for reflection,\" said he.  \"You may not have looked at all the\r\ndifficulties of the case. I will give you until dinner-time to make up\r\nyour minds; and to help your thoughts, I will assign to each of you an\r\noffice, and make you responsible for providing all things necessary for\r\na week’s excursion, to begin in the morning.\r\n\r\n\"Harold, I appoint you master of the hunting and fishing departments.\r\n\r\n\"Robert shall be sailing-master, and provide for the literature of the\r\nparty.\r\n\r\n\"Mary shall be housekeeper still, and mistress of the stores.\r\n\r\n\"And Master Frank shall be--I know not what to make him, unless\r\n_supercargo_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now I wish you each to sit down at your leisure, and make out a written\r\nlist, to be presented to me at dinner-time, of all things needed in your\r\nseveral departments.\"\r\n\r\nThey responded very heartily, and were about to retire, when Dr. Gordon,\r\nobserving a comical expression on Frank’s face, said, \"What is the\r\nmatter, Frank?  Are you not willing to be supercargo?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know what supercargo is,\" answered Frank, \"unless it is\r\nsomebody to catch rabbits.  But I know how to do that.  So I mean to\r\ntake my dog and hatchet, and a box of matches.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well done, Frank,\" said his father; \"you have the marooning spirit if\r\nyou do not know what supercargo is. But where did you learn the art of\r\ncatching rabbits?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, I learnt it from cousin Harold,\" said he.  \"We got a rabbit into a\r\nhollow tree, and caught him there. _I_ caught him, father, with my own\r\nhand; I know exactly how to catch a rabbit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, Mr. Supercargo, carry what you will. But go along all of\r\nyou, and be ready with your lists against dinner-time.\"\r\n\r\nThey retired in great glee to plan out and prepare. Robert and Harold,\r\nhaving first gone to the beach to think alone, were to be seen, half an\r\nhour afterwards, in their room, busily engaged with pencil in hand.  At\r\nthis time Frank came in.  He had been almost frantic with joy at the\r\nprospect of the change; and after having romped with his dog Fidelle and\r\nthe goats in the yard, he had come to romp with any one who would join\r\nhim in the house.\r\n\r\n\"Brother Robert and cousin Harold,\" said he, \"what are you doing?  Are\r\nyou writing? are you ciphering? are you studying?  Why do you not answer\r\nme?\"  He was evidently in a frolic.\r\n\r\n\"Go to your play, Frank, and do not bother us,\" returned Robert,\r\nimpatiently; \"we are thinking.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know you are; for father said we are thinking all the time we are\r\nawake, and sometimes while we are asleep.  But I want to know what you\r\nare thinking about so hard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don’t you know,\" Harold answered, mildly, \"that we are going to Riley’s\r\nIsland tomorrow, and that Robert and I have to make out a list of what\r\nwe are to carry? We are making our lists.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah ha! but I have to carry some things too,\" said he. \"Father is going\r\nto let me catch the rabbits there; and he called me a ----, some kind of\r\na ----; I forget the name, but it means the person to catch rabbits.\r\nWhat is the name, brother?\"\r\n\r\n\"Supercargo?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that’s it--supercargo.  Mustn’t I think of something too?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" replied Harold, humouring the joke. \"But the way _we_ did,\r\nwas first to go off by ourselves, and think of what we were to carry;\r\nthen to come in and write off our lists.  Do you go now and think over\r\nyours, and when you come in I will write it for you.\"\r\n\r\nFrank went out, but he was not gone long.  He insisted on having his\r\nlist made out at once.\r\n\r\n\"What do you wish to carry?\" Harold asked.  Frank told him.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said Harold, \"I will make a bargain with you.  If you do not\r\ntrouble us before we have finished our work, I will write your list for\r\nyou so that you yourself can read it.  Will you stay out now?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I will.  But can you write it so that I can read it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and will not print it either.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, then you must be a very smart teacher, almost as smart as the\r\nfoxes; for father has been teaching me this summer to make writing\r\nmarks, but I have never made one of the writing marks yet.\"\r\n\r\nHarold however persisted in his promise, and he and Frank were as good\r\nas their several words.  Frank, it is true, did creep on tip-toe, and\r\npeep through the crack of the door, but he disturbed nobody; and when at\r\nlast the boys came out, Harold presented him with a folded paper, which\r\nhe instructed him to put into his pocket, and not to open till the lists\r\nwere called for.\r\n\r\nAt the appointed hour they all assembled.  The meal passed pleasantly\r\noff; not an allusion had as yet been made to the proposed excursion.  It\r\nwas a part of Dr. Gordon’s training to practise his children in\r\nself-restraint.  He could however discern by their looks that their\r\ndecisions remained as before.  Said he, \"I presume you have all made up\r\nyour minds to the marooning party; am I correct?\"\r\n\r\n\"O yes, sir, yes,\" was the answer, \"and we are all ready to report, not\r\nexcepting Frank and William.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, you have done wonders!  But let me call upon you each in turn.\r\nHarold McIntosh, you are hunting and fishing-master.  Let me hear your\r\nreport.\"\r\n\r\nHarold took from his pocket a piece of paper about as broad as his hand,\r\nand a little longer.  Besides the arms, ammunition and appurtenances,\r\nfishing-hooks, lines and nets, he closed his list with reading\r\n\"brimstone.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what use,\" asked his uncle, \"do you expect to make of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Taking bee-trees,\" he replied.  \"Brimstone is used in driving bees from\r\nthe honey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whether we meet with bee-trees or not, the brimstone will be in\r\nnobody’s way; let it go.  Mr. Hunting-master your list is perfect.  Now\r\nRobert, yours.\"\r\n\r\nHis list embraced all that the boat would need for comfort, or for\r\nrepair in case of accident.  The books selected had reference to the\r\ntaste of each.  Shakespeare for his father, Goldsmith’s Natural History\r\nfor Harold, Scott’s Napoleon for himself, Robinson Crusoe and Botany for\r\nhis sister, and (in a spirit of mischief) Old Mother Hubbard for Frank.\r\n\r\nBut Frank was quite indignant at what he knew to be an insinuation\r\nagainst his childish taste.  \"I will not have old Mother Hubbard for my\r\nbook,\" he said, as soon as he heard the list read.  \"I have passed that\r\nlong ago; I wanted to carry Jack the Giant Killer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Scratch out Mother Hubbard,\" said his father to Robert, \"and put down\r\nJack.  Your list, Master Robert, is pretty good; but I shall take the\r\nliberty of adding several volumes to the stock, in case of bad weather.\r\nAnd beside this, I should advise you all to carry your pocket\r\nTestaments, that you may continue your plan of daily reading.  I should\r\nbe sorry, and almost afraid, to let our sports interfere with our\r\ndevotions.\"\r\n\r\nUp to this time Frank had been listening to what had been read or\r\nspoken.  But now, on a sign from Harold, he took a paper from his\r\npocket, and, looking at its contents, commenced capering round the room,\r\nsaying, \"I _can_ read it--I can read every word of it!\"\r\n\r\n\"Read what?\" asked his father.\r\n\r\n\"My list,\" replied Frank, \"that cousin Harold wrote for me.  I can read\r\nit all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let us have it.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: pictures of items on the list]\r\n\r\n\"Here,\" said he, \"is my hatchet.\"\r\n\r\n\"And here is my bow and arrows.\"\r\n\r\n\"And here is my dog; only it is not half so pretty as Fidelle.\"\r\n\r\n\"And down here at the bottom--that is--that is--I believe it is--either\r\na block or a brick-bat. O, now I remember, it is my box of matches.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bravo, Frank,\" said his father, \"you do credit to your teacher.  I\r\ndoubt whether I could myself have guessed what that last thing was\r\nintended for.  Your list may pass also.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Miss Mary, let us have yours.  You have had more to think of than\r\nall the others put together, and yet I’ll warrant you are nearly as\r\nperfect in proportion.\"\r\n\r\nMary blushed to hear the commendation bestowed upon her on trust, and\r\nreplied, \"I doubt it, father.  For though it is very long, I am all the\r\nwhile thinking of something else to be added, and I am pretty sure there\r\nis a great deal yet that I have forgotten.\"  She then read her own list,\r\ncontaining about thirty-five articles, and William’s, embracing half a\r\ndozen more; upon which her father continued to bestow praise for the\r\nhouse-wifery they showed, and to each of which he made some slight\r\nadditions.\r\n\r\n\"Now, William,\" said he, \"do you select two moderately sized boxes, and\r\naid Miss Mary to pack everything in her line so as not to crowd the\r\nboat.  Remember, too, to put in for Riley a half bushel of salt, a loaf\r\nof sugar, and a peck of wheat flour.  Pack the boat, and have it\r\ncomplete this evening, however late it should take you, that there may\r\nbe no delay in the morning.\"\r\n\r\nThey were no sooner dismissed from table than all went vigorously to\r\nwork.  Guns were cleaned--hooks and lines examined--boxes packed--all\r\nthings being done by classes.  Then each person put up an extra suit or\r\ntwo of clothing, in case of accidents.  And so expeditiously did the\r\nwork go forward, that by five o’clock that evening the boat was ready\r\nfor her trip.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nEMBARKATION--ABDUCTION EXTRAORDINARY--EFFORTS TO ESCAPE--ALTERNATE HOPES\r\nAND FEARS--DESPAIR--VESSEL IN THE DISTANCE--RENEWED HOPES AND\r\nEFFORTS--WATER-SPOUT--FLASH OF LIGHTNING AND ITS EFFECTS--MAKING FOR\r\nSHORE--GRATEFUL ACKNOWLEDGMENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nMany visions that night danced before the young sleepers--prancing deer\r\nwith bright eyes and branching horns; turkeys running, flying,\r\nfluttering; white tents, mossy beds, and all the wild scenes of woodland\r\nlife.  They were up and dressed at daybreak.  The wind was fair, and the\r\nday promised to be fine.  Frank’s little feet were pattering over the\r\nwhole house and yard, carrying him into everybody’s way, on the pretence\r\nof rendering assistance.  There was one useful suggestion which he made.\r\nHe had gone to each room and corner in the house, saying \"good-bye\" to\r\nevery person and thing, chairs, tables, and all, when at last he came to\r\nhis father’s cloak and umbrella, kept in the same corner.\r\n\r\n\"Good-bye, umbrella,\" said he, \"but as for you, good Mr. Cloak, father\r\nwill want you to sleep on.  Poor umbrella! are you not sorry?  Don’t you\r\nwant to go too?  But, father!\" he cried, running into the next room,\r\n\"had we not better carry the umbrella?  Maybe we shall need it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a good idea, Master Frank,\" said his father. \"Do you take\r\ncharge of the umbrella, as a part of your office, and see it put into\r\nthe boat.\"\r\n\r\nFrank ran back to the room he had left, and taking the umbrella from its\r\ncorner, he said, \"O ho, my little fellow, father says you may go.  Are\r\nyou not glad I asked for you?  But you must be a good boy, and not put\r\nyourself in anybody’s way.  Come now, spread your wings, and let me see\r\nhow glad you look.\"\r\n\r\nHe opened the umbrella, and flapped it several times to make it look\r\nlively, then closed it, and set it beside the cloak where it belonged.\r\nPresently he heard the tinkle of a little silver bell, and knew that it\r\nwas the signal for family prayers.  He went to the breakfast-room, and\r\ntook his seat.\r\n\r\nDr. Gordon’s children were well versed in the Scriptures, and were\r\nremarkably attentive during the reading of them.  Perhaps one secret of\r\nthis fact was to be found in their father’s practice of stopping every\r\nfew verses during the family reading to ask them questions on what had\r\nbeen read, and briefly to explain what they could not otherwise\r\ncomprehend.  This morning the children observed that the chapter read\r\nwas remarkably appropriate to their circumstances, and that the Doctor\r\nprayed particularly that the Lord would preserve them from all sin and\r\nharm during their excursion; that he would preside over their pleasures,\r\nand that he would make their temporary absence the means of their\r\nknowing him better, and loving him more.\r\n\r\nThey breakfasted as the sun was rising.  While at table no one could\r\nspeak of anything but the voyage and the island, and what they expected\r\nto see, do, and enjoy.  The boat was at the wharf, which had been\r\nerected for the brig.  It was packed, and ready for departure, with the\r\nexception of a few things to be carried by hand.  William had\r\nbreakfasted at the same time with the family, and now came in, saying,\r\n\"All ready, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, children,\" said Dr. Gordon, \"let us go.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, umbrella,\" said Frank, \"you are to go with me.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, father,\" exclaimed Mary, as they approached the shore, \"there is\r\nNanny with her sweet little kids.  See how anxiously she looks at the\r\nboat, and tries to say, ’Do let me go too.’  Had we not better take her?\r\nShe is so tame; and then you are so fond of milk in your coffee.\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt,\" he replied, \"whether there will be room for dogs, goats, and\r\nourselves too.  But we can easily determine; and as I know that all of\r\nyou are as fond of milk as I am, I will let her go if there is room.\"\r\n\r\nThey took their places, Dr. Gordon at the helm, Robert and Harold\r\namidships, Mary and Frank next to their father, and William in the bow.\r\nEverything had been stowed so snugly away, and the boat was withal so\r\nroomy, that Nanny and her kids were invited to a place.\r\n\r\n\"Now, children, for order’s sake,\" said Dr. Gordon, \"I will assign the\r\nbow of the boat, where William is, to Nanny and her kids; Fidelle must\r\nlie here by Frank and Mum may go with Harold.  Mary, call your pet, and\r\nhave her in her place.\"\r\n\r\nA word about the dogs.  Fidelle was a beautiful and high-blooded\r\nspaniel, that might have been taught anything which a dog could learn,\r\nbut whose only accomplishments as yet were of a very simple character,\r\nand confined chiefly to such tricks as were a source of amusement to her\r\nlittle master.  Mum was a large, ugly, rough-looking cur, whose value\r\nwould never have been suspected from his appearance.  He was brave,\r\nfaithful, and sagacious; strong, swift-footed, and obedient.  But his\r\nchief value consisted in his education.  He came from the pine barrens\r\nof Georgia, where Dr. Gordon had first seen and purchased him, and where\r\nhe had been trained, according to the custom of the wild woodsmen there,\r\nto hunt silently; and in following the trail of a deer or turkey to keep\r\njust in advance of his master, and to give suitable indications of being\r\nnear the object of pursuit. Mum was no common dog; and he proved of\r\ninestimable service to the young adventurers in their coming\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\n\"Draw in the anchor, William, while I cast off at the stern,\" said Dr.\r\nGordon.  \"But hold! let us see what that means.\"  He pointed with his\r\nfinger to a horseman, who turned a point on the beach, and seeing them\r\nabout to depart, waved his hat to say \"stop!\"  The horseman rode at full\r\nspeed, and soon was within speaking distance. He bore a note from the\r\nsurgeon at Fort Brooke, requesting the loan of a certain instrument\r\nwhich Dr. Gordon had promised when on his visit, and for which there was\r\nnow a sudden call.\r\n\r\n\"Keep your places, children,\" said the Doctor.  \"I shall be gone only\r\nfive minutes.  William, do you take my place, and keep the boat steady\r\nby holding to this frame.\"\r\n\r\nHe ascended the wharf, went with the soldier to the house, and was\r\nabsent a very few minutes; but during that interval an event occurred\r\nwhich separated them for a long, long time and made them oftentimes fear\r\nthat they should never more meet in this world.\r\n\r\nThe position of the boat at the wharf was peculiar. Her stern had been\r\nlashed to the timbers, for the purpose of keeping it steady, until all\r\nhad entered; and the bow was kept to its place by the anchor dropped\r\ninto the two and half fathoms water, which \"was had\" there at high tide.\r\nThe fastening to the stern having been cast off, preparatory to leaving,\r\nWilliam was now holding to the wharf, awaiting his master’s return.\r\n\r\nThis was not long after sunrise, at which moment they had heard the\r\nreport of a cannon unusually loud from the fort.  Scarcely had Dr.\r\nGordon disappeared from the bluff, when the young people noticed a heavy\r\nripple of the water, between them and the fort, indicating that it was\r\ndisturbed by a multitude of very large fish, moving with rapidity\r\ntowards the sea.\r\n\r\n\"What can they be?\" was a question which all asked, with a curiosity not\r\nunmixed with fear, as they looked upon the approaching waves.  William\r\nheld firmly to the pier head, that the boat should not be moved too\r\nroughly by the disturbed water.\r\n\r\n\"Mas’ Robert,\" said he, with anxious, dilating eyes, \"I do believe it is\r\na school of dem debbil-fish.  Yes,\" and his eyes grew wild and his lips\r\nbecame ashy, \"dey making right for dis pint.\"[#]\r\n\r\n\r\n[#] The following is a description of the hideous monster known in our\r\nwaters as the Devil Fish.\r\n\r\nIt is a flat fish, belonging to the family of Rays, and usually measures\r\nsomewhere between ten and twenty feet from tip to tip of its wings.  On\r\neach side of its mouth is a flexible arm, with which the animal grasps\r\nand feeds.  It appears to be as remarkable for its stupidity as it is\r\nfor its size, strength, and ugliness, seldom letting go anything which\r\nit once seizes with its arms. A few years since, one was discovered dead\r\nupon a mud flat near St. Mary’s, Georgia, grasping even in death a\r\nstrong stake of which it had taken hold during high water.  The incident\r\nrelated in the following pages is in perfect keeping with the habits of\r\nthe fish.  There are hundreds of persons now living, who recollect a\r\nsimilar adventure which took place in the bay of Charleston.  On every\r\noccasion of serious alarm the fish makes for the deep water of the\r\nocean, and sometimes so frantically as to run high and dry ashore.\r\n\r\nWhoever wishes to read more on this subject, can do so by referring to a\r\nvolume called \"Carolina Sports,\" in which the author (Hon. William\r\nElliott), sketches with lively and graphic pen some most adventurous\r\nscenes, in which he himself was principal actor.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe children sprang to their feet, and made a rush to the stern, in the\r\neffort to get out of the boat, but William put his hand against them,\r\nand exclaimed piteously, \"Back!  Mas’ Robert--Mas’ Harrol!  All of you!\r\nYou habn’t time to git out!  Here dey come!  Down on your seats!  For\r\nmassy’s sake, down! ebery body!\"\r\n\r\nThey were about to obey, when there was a whirl, and then a jerk of the\r\nboat, that threw them flat on their faces.  They heard William’s voice\r\ncrying hoarsely, \"O Lord hab----;\" and when they arose and looked\r\naround, they saw that he was missing, and that their boat was rushing\r\nonward with a swiftness that made the water boil.\r\n\r\n\"William!  William!\" Robert called in bewilderment; but no answer came,\r\nand they saw him no more.\r\n\r\n\"O mercy!  Brother Robert! cousin Harold!\" cried Mary, \"what is the\r\nmatter?\"\r\n\r\nRobert looked vacantly towards the receding shore. Harold answered, \"One\r\nof these fish has tripped our anchor, and is carrying us out to sea.\"\r\n\r\nThe horrid truth was evident; and it sent a chill like death through\r\ntheir limbs and veins.  Mary screamed and fell back senseless.  Robert\r\nstarted up as though about to spring from the boat.  Harold covered his\r\nface with his hands, gave one groan, then with compressed lips and\r\nexpanded nostrils hastened to the bow of the boat.  As for poor little\r\nFrank, it was not for some moments that he could realize the state of\r\nthe case; but when he did, his exhibition of distress was affecting. He\r\nstretched his hands towards home; and as he saw his father running to\r\nthe bluff, he called out, \"O, father, help us--dear father!  O send a\r\nboat after us! O----!\"  Perceiving his father fall upon his knees and\r\nclasp his hands in prayer, he cried out, \"O, yes, father, pray to God to\r\nhelp us, and he will do it--God can help us!\"  Then falling upon his own\r\nknees, he began, \"O God bless my father and mother, my brothers and\r\nsisters!  O God help us!\"\r\n\r\nBy this time the boat had passed fully half a mile from shore.  Harold’s\r\nmovement forward had been made with the intention of doing something, he\r\nknew not what, to relieve the boat from the deadly grasp of the devil\r\nfish.  He first seized his rifle, and standing upon the forward\r\nplatform, aimed it at the back of the monster, which could be distinctly\r\nseen at two fathoms’ distance, clutching the chain which constituted\r\ntheir cable. Despairing of reaching him with a ball through the\r\nintervening water, he laid aside the rifle, and seizing William’s ax,\r\naimed several lusty blows at the cable chain.  He struck it just on the\r\nedge of the boat where there was the greatest prospect of breaking it;\r\nbut the chain was composed of links unusually short and strong, and the\r\nblows of the ax served only to sink it into the soft wood of the boat.\r\n\r\n\"Robert,\" said he, \"look for Frank’s hatchet, and come here.\"  But\r\nRobert, stupefied with fear, sat staring at him from beside his\r\nprostrate sister and weeping brother, and seemed neither to understand\r\nnor to hear.\r\n\r\n\"Robert,\" he repeated, \"get up, and be a man.  Bring Frank’s hatchet,\r\nand help me break this chain.\"\r\n\r\nStill he did not come.  \"It is no use, Harold,\" he replied.  \"Do you not\r\nsee that sister is dead?  William is dead too!  We shall all die!\"\r\n\r\n\"Robert!  Robert!\" he reiterated, almost with a threat, \"do rouse up and\r\nbe a man.  Mary is not dead, she has only fainted; she will come to\r\ndirectly.  Come here and help me.\"\r\n\r\nAs he said, \"She has only fainted,\" Robert sprang from his seat, took\r\noff his cap, dipped it full of water, poured it on her face, rubbed her\r\npalms and wrists to start the blood into circulation, then blew in her\r\nface, and fanned her with his wet cap.  In the course of a minute Mary\r\nbegan to breathe, and then to sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" he exclaimed, \"she _has_ only fainted! she is coming to!\r\nFrank, do you fan her now and I will help Harold.\"\r\n\r\nBut Harold had helped himself.  Going to Frank’s parcel, he had taken\r\nout the hatchet, and returned to the bows, where he was now adjusting\r\nthe ax, preparatory to his work.  \"There, Robert,\" on his coming up, \"do\r\nyou hold the ax firmly under the chain, while I strike this link with\r\nthe hatchet.\"\r\n\r\nHe did so, and Harold struck a blow upon the chain, so heavy that it\r\nrang again.  Instantly they staggered, said fell backwards in the boat.\r\nThe sharp sound of the hatchet upon the links had been conveyed along\r\nthe metal to the fish, and made it dart forward with a sudden jerk.\r\nHarold rose, and looked on a moment.  \"We can’t help his being\r\nfrightened, Robert.  We must break the chain.  Let us try again.\"\r\n\r\nHe struck blow after blow, though the fish seemed to be affected by each\r\nas by an electric shock.  Robert held back his arm.  \"Stop! stop!\r\nHarold, we are sinking!\"\r\n\r\nIt was even so.  The fish, frightened by the sharp repeated sounds, had\r\ngone down so far as to sink the bow of the boat within a few inches of\r\nthe water.  But Harold was not to be stopped.  With an almost frantic\r\nlaugh, he looked fiercely at the slimy monster beneath, then at his pale\r\ncompanions, and raised his arm for another blow.  \"Robert,\" said he, \"it\r\nmust be so.  We must break the chain or die.\"  He struck again, again,\r\nand again, until the water began to ripple over the bow, and splash upon\r\nhis hand.  He stopped, and tears came into his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Look, Harold, at the staple,\" said Robert.  \"Let us see if that cannot\r\nbe started.\"  They tried it, striking from side to side, but in vain.\r\nThe boat was too well made; the staple was too large, and too firmly\r\nimbedded in the timbers to be disturbed; and, moreover, it was guarded\r\nby an iron plate all around.  Harold decided it was easier to break the\r\nchain.  \"Is there not a file, nor even a chisel among the tools?\" he\r\nasked.  They rummaged among the several boxes and parcels, but no tools\r\nof the kind could be found; and then they sat down pale, panting, and\r\ndispirited.\r\n\r\nBy this time the boat had passed out of the bay. The persons on shore,\r\nthe houses, indeed the very trees which marked the place of their abode,\r\nhad faded successively from sight.  They had been running through the\r\nwater at a fearful rate, for an hour and a half, and were now in the\r\nbroad open gulf, moving as madly as before.  The frightened fish,\r\nalarmed at these repeated noises in the boat, and grasping still more\r\nconvulsively the chain which was to it an object of terror, had\r\noutstripped its hideous companions, and after passing from the bay had\r\nturned towards the south.\r\n\r\n\"There is Riley’s Island!\" said Robert, pointing sadly to a grove of\r\ntall palmettoes, which they were passing. \"And yonder is a boat, near\r\nshore, with a man in it. O, if Riley could see us, and come after us!\r\nAnd yet what if he did!  No boat can be moved by wind or paddle as we\r\nare moving.\"  After a few minutes he resumed: \"There is one plan yet\r\nwhich we have not tried; it is to saw the chain in two with pieces of\r\ncrockery. I have read of marble being cut with sand, and of diamonds\r\nbeing cut with horse hair.  And I think that if we work long enough we\r\ncan cut the chain in two with a broken plate.  Shall we try it?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, yes, try anything,\" Harold replied, \"But,\" looking at the flapping\r\nwings and horrible figure of the fish, and grinding his teeth, \"if he\r\nwould come near enough to the surface, I should try a rifle ball in his\r\nhead.\"\r\n\r\nThey broke one of the plates, and commenced to saw. Harold worked for\r\nhalf an hour, then gave it to Robert, who laboured faithfully.  Had they\r\nbeen able to keep the link perfectly firm, and also to work all the time\r\nprecisely on one spot, they might possibly have succeeded.  But after\r\ntwo hours’ hard work, the only result was that they had brightened one\r\nof the links by rubbing off the rust and a little of the metal.\r\n\r\n\"O, this will never, never do!\" exclaimed Harold. \"It will take us till\r\nmidnight to saw through this chain, and then we shall be upon the broad\r\nsea, without any hope of returning home.  Robert, I am done!  My hands\r\nare blistered!  My limbs are sore!  I have done what I could!  And now\r\nthe Lord have mercy upon us!\"\r\n\r\nUp to that moment Harold had been the life and soul of the exertions\r\nmade.  His courage and energy had inspired the rest with confidence.\r\nBut now that his strong spirit gave way, and he sunk upon his seat, and\r\nburst into tears, it seemed that all hope was gone. Robert threw down\r\nhis piece of plate, and went to seat himself by Mary, in the hinder part\r\nof the boat.  Frank had long since cried himself to sleep, and there he\r\nlay sobbing in his slumbers, with his head in Mary’s lap. Mary was still\r\npale from suffering and anxiety; having recovered by means of the water\r\nand fanning, she had summoned her fortitude and tried to comfort Frank\r\nwith the hope that Harold and Robert would succeed in breaking the\r\nchain, and then that they would spread their beautiful sail, and return\r\nhome.  When Robert took his seat, Frank awakened, and asked for water.\r\n\r\n\"Sister Mary,\" said he, \"where is father?  I thought he was here.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, buddy,\" she replied, her eyes filling to think that he had awakened\r\nto so sad a reality, \"father is at home.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, sister,\" said he, \"I dreamed that father was with us, that he prayed\r\nto God to help us, and God made the fish let go, and we all went home.\r\nBrother Robert, have you broken that chain?\"\r\n\r\nThis last appeal was too much for Robert’s fortitude, tried already by\r\nrepeated disappointments.  He covered his face with his cap, and his\r\nwhole body shook with emotion.\r\n\r\n\"Brother Robert,\" said Mary, speaking through her own tears, \"you ought\r\nnot to give up so.  The fish is obliged to let go some time or other,\r\nand then may be some ship will pass by, and take us up.  Remember how\r\nlong people have floated upon broken pieces of a wreck, even without\r\nanything to eat, while we have plenty to eat for a month.  Brother\r\nRobert and cousin Harold, do try to be comforted.\"\r\n\r\nShe obtained the water for Frank, and gave him something to eat.\r\n\"Brother,\" she added, \"you and cousin Harold have worked hard, and eaten\r\nnothing.  Will you not take something?  There are some nice cakes.\"\r\nBoth declined.  \"Well, here is some water.  I know you must be thirsty.\"\r\n\r\nHarold was so much surprised to see a girl of Mary’s age and gentle\r\nspirit exercising more self-control than himself, that he was shamed out\r\nof his despair.  He did not then know that trait in the female\r\ncharacter, which fits her to comfort when the stronger spirit has been\r\noverwhelmed.  He drank a mouthful of the water.  She handed it also to\r\nRobert, but he pushed it way, saying, \"No, sister, I do not want\r\nanything now.  We have done all that we could, and yet--.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, brother,\" she replied, \"not at all.  There is one thing more that\r\nyou have not even tried to do; and that may help us more than anything\r\nelse.  It is to pray to God to help us.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, yes, brother,\" Frank added, \"don’t you recollect what father read to\r\nus out of the Bible, and talked to us about?  What is it, sister?\"\r\n\r\n\"When my father and my mother forsake me, then the Lord will take me\r\nup,\" Mary recited.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, brother,\" he continued, \"remember that father prayed for us, when\r\nhe saw us going off.  And sister and I have been praying here, while you\r\nand cousin Harold were working yonder.  Brother Robert, God _will_ take\r\ncare of us, if we pray to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"What Frank says is true, brother,\" said Mary.  \"He and I have been\r\npraying most of the time that you were working.  And now see the\r\ndifference! when you two have given up everything, he and I are quiet\r\nand hoping. Brother Robert, we all ought to pray.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do pray--I have prayed,\" replied Robert.\r\n\r\n\"That may be,\" persisted Mary, \"but what I mean is, that we all ought to\r\npray together.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot pray aloud,\" Robert answered; \"I never did it.  I do not know\r\nhow to do it.  But we can all kneel down together, and pray silently\r\nthat God will have mercy on us.  Harold, will you join us in kneeling\r\ndown?\"\r\n\r\nAs they were rising for this purpose, Frank called out, \"Brother, what\r\nis that yonder?  Isn’t it a boat coming to meet us?\"\r\n\r\nTheir eyes turned in the direction of Frank’s finger and it was plain\r\nthat a sail had heaved into the offing far away to the south, and almost\r\nin their course.  The sun shone upon the snow-white canvas.  \"God be\r\npraised!\" exclaimed Robert; \"that is a vessel!  Who knows but we may yet\r\nmeet her, and be saved!  Let us kneel down, and pray God to be merciful\r\nto us.\"  They did so; and when they rose from their knees the vessel was\r\nevidently nearer.\r\n\r\n\"Let us try her with the spy glass,\" said Robert, and drawing it out to\r\nits proper length, he gazed steadily at her for a minute.  \"That is a\r\nschooner, or rather an hemaphrodite brig.  I can see her sails and\r\nmasts.  She is rigged like a revenue cutter, and seems also to have the\r\nrake of one.  She is coming this way, and if she is a cutter, she is\r\nalmost certainly bound for Tampa, and can take us home again.\"\r\n\r\nHow rapidly characters appear to shift with shifting circumstances!\r\nMary and Frank, who but a minute before were the only ones calm and\r\ndisposed to speak in tones of energy and hope, now began to weep and\r\nlose all self-control; while Robert and Harold, shaking off their\r\ndespondency, sprang to their feet, and with bright eyes and ready limbs,\r\nprepared once more for effort.  Harold seized the glass, and looked long\r\nand steadily.  \"She is coming to us, or we are going to her very fast,\"\r\nsaid he.  \"Perhaps both; and now what shall we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Rig up a signal, and load the guns,\" replied Robert. \"Let us attract\r\ntheir attention as soon as possible. Quick, sister, get me a sheet!\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of fifteen minutes they had the sheet rigged and floating;\r\nand by the time the guns were loaded, they could clearly discern not\r\nonly the hull, but the port holes of the vessel, and her long raking\r\nmasts. There was no further doubt that she was a revenue cutter bound\r\nfor the bay.  Still it became every moment more certain that without\r\nsome change in the course of one or the other, they must pass at a\r\nconsiderable distance.  Now what should they do?  The sky, which had\r\nbeen gradually clouding over since they saw the vessel, began to be\r\nrapidly and heavily overcast as they approached.  Fearful that rain\r\nmight fall, and utterly obscure their signal before it was seen, the\r\nboys resolved to fire their guns, ere there was any reasonable hope that\r\nthey could be heard.  At the first discharge the fish, which had\r\nprobably been frightened in the morning by the cannon at the fort,\r\njerked so terribly as almost to unseat them.  At the discharge of the\r\nremaining guns it seemed less and less alarmed, until finally it ceased\r\ndarting altogether; its strength was failing.  Soon afterwards they saw\r\nthe smoke of two cannon from the vessel, and then a flag run up the\r\nmast.  \"They see us! They see us!\" cried Robert and Mary.\r\n\r\n\"But can they help us?\" asked Harold.  \"Here we are running between them\r\nand shore, faster than any vessel can sail except in a storm, and there\r\nis scarcely wind enough to fill their sails, and what there is is\r\nagainst their coming to our aid.  Robert, we must break that chain, or\r\nyet all is lost.\"\r\n\r\nThere was apparently some bustle on board the cutter. Many persons could\r\nbe distinguished by the glass looking at them and at the clouds.  They\r\nwere preparing to lower a boat, yet with manifest hesitation.  This was\r\nimmediately explained by the singular appearance of the cloud between\r\nthe boat and the vessel.  It had become exceedingly dark and angry.  A\r\nportion in the middle assumed the shape of a trumpet, and descended with\r\nthe sharp point toward the water; while a broad column ascended from the\r\nsea to meet it; and then sea and sky roared and tossed in terrible\r\nunison.\r\n\r\n\"It is a water-spout!\" said Robert, \"if it strikes the vessel she is\r\ngone.  Look there, Harold, look!\"\r\n\r\nThe cutter began to give sensible evidence of the whirling eddy.  Her\r\nsails flapped and her masts reeled. Soon they heard boom! boom! the roar\r\nof two more cannon.  They were for the purpose of breaking the\r\nthreatening column.  They saw the descending pillar gradually ascend,\r\nand spread itself into a dark mass of cloud, which poured out such a\r\nshower of rain as entirely to hide the vessel from sight.  Afterwards\r\nthey heard another cannon.  \"That is for us,\" Robert said; \"let us\r\nanswer it as well as we can.\"\r\n\r\nThey fired gun after gun, and heard cannon after cannon in reply, but\r\neach fainter than before.  Their last hope of being saved by the vessel\r\nwas gone.  She was far away, and hidden by the rain which enveloped her.\r\nThere had been no rain upon themselves, but it was very dark overhead,\r\nand threatened both rain and wind.  They were far enough from home--how\r\nfar they could not conceive, and far too from the barely visible shore,\r\nupon the broad wild sea.  The boys were relapsing rapidly into that\r\nmoody despair which is so natural after strong yet fruitless exertion,\r\nwhen a sharp flash of lightning struck in the water about one hundred\r\nyards before them.  So near was it, and so severe, that they were almost\r\nblinded by the blaze, and stunned by the report.  Their boat instantly\r\nrelaxed its speed, and was soon motionless upon the water.  The boys\r\nrushed to the bow.  Their cable hung perpendicularly down, and the fish\r\nwas nowhere to be seen.  It had darted back from the lightning flash,\r\nand the cable had slipped quietly from its grasp.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God we are loose!\" burst triumphantly from Robert.  Harold looked\r\non with strong emotion.  Once more tears gathered in his eyes.\r\n\"Robert,\" said he, \"I never did make pretension to being a Christian, or\r\na praying person, but if we do not thank God all of us for this when we\r\nget ashore, we do not deserve to live.\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen!\" said Robert; and Mary and Frank responded, \"Amen!\"\r\n\r\nThe shore was full seven miles away.  It was probably wild and barren.\r\nIt might be difficult of approach, and inhospitable after they should\r\nland.  But gladly did they draw aboard their anchor, raise their sail,\r\nand make toward it.  The sea was smooth, but there was wind enough to\r\nfill their sails, and give promise of their reaching the shore ere\r\nnight.  Robert took the helm, and Harold managed the sails.  Mary once\r\nmore brought out her cakes and other eatables.  Frank laughed from very\r\npleasure; and seldom, if ever, was a happier looking company to be seen,\r\ngoing to a strange and perhaps a hostile coast.\r\n\r\nFar as the eye could reach, to the north and south, there was a bluff of\r\nwhite sand, varied here and there by a hillock, higher than the rest,\r\nwhich the winds had blown up from the beach.  Before them was an inlet\r\nof some sort--whether a small bay, the mouth of a river, or an arm of\r\nthe sea, they could not determine; it was fringed on the south with a\r\nrichly coloured forest, and on the north by a growth of rank and\r\nnauseous mangroves.  Into this inlet they steered, anxious only for a\r\nsafe anchorage during the night.  A little before sunset they reached a\r\npleasant landing-place, on the southern shore, near the forest; and\r\nhaving been confined all day to the boat, they were glad enough to\r\nrelieve themselves from their wearisome inaction, by a few minutes’\r\nexercise on land.  Harold first ascended the bluff, and looked in every\r\ndirection to see if there was any sign of inhabitants.  No house or\r\nsmoke was visible; nothing but an apparently untouched forest to the\r\nleft, and a sandy, sterile country to the right.\r\n\r\n\"Cousins,\" said he, \"I think we may with safety sleep on the beach\r\ntonight.  With our dogs to guard, nothing can approach without our\r\nknowledge.  I am almost afraid to anchor in the stream, lest we should\r\nbe carried off by another devil-fish.\"\r\n\r\nTo this proposal they agreed.  The tent was handily contrived, requiring\r\nonly a few minutes for its erection; and while Mary and Frank drove down\r\nthe tent-pins, Harold and Robert brought into it the cloaks and blankets\r\nfor sleeping, together with their guns, and other necessaries for\r\ncomfort and safety.\r\n\r\nAs the darkness closed around them, its gloom was relieved by the ruddy\r\nblaze of a fire, which Robert and Harold had made with dried branches\r\nfrom a fallen oak, and kindled by Frank’s matches Mary soon had some tea\r\nprepared, which they found delightfully refreshing.  Immediately after\r\nit, Harold, whose countenance ever since their escape from the fish had\r\nassumed a peculiarly thoughtful expression, remarked:\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt we all remember what we said in the boat about being\r\nthankful; and I have no doubt that from the bottom of our hearts we do\r\nthank God for our deliverance; but I think we ought to say so aloud\r\ntogether, and in our prayers, before we go to sleep this night.\"\r\n\r\nNo one answered, and he proceeded: \"Robert, if you can speak for us,\r\nplease say in our name what you know we ought to say.\"\r\n\r\nThere being still no reply, except a shake of Robert’s head, Harold\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n\"Then we can at least kneel down together, and I will say, ’Thanks to\r\nthe Lord for his mercies, and may we never forget them;’ after which we\r\ncan unite in the Lord’s Prayer.\"\r\n\r\nThey knelt down.  Harold did not confine himself to the words just\r\nrecorded; he was much more full, and became more at ease with every word\r\nhe uttered; and when the others united with him in repeating aloud the\r\nLord’s Prayer, as they had been accustomed to unite with their father in\r\nfamily worship, it was with an earnestness that they never felt before,\r\nand that was perceptible in every word and tone.  That wild coast was\r\nprobably for the first time hallowed with the voice of Christian prayer.\r\n\r\nThey made the boat secure by drawing the anchor well upon the beach.\r\nThey spread their cloaks and blankets upon the dry sand, and lay down to\r\nrest.  Their dogs kept watch at the door of their tent; and they slept\r\nsoundly, and without the least disturbance, during the whole of this\r\ntheir first night of exile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nWAKING UP--GOOD RESOLUTIONS--ALARM--MAROONING BREAKFAST--SEARCH FOR\r\nWATER--UNEXPECTED GAIN--OYSTER BANK--FATE OF A RACCOON--THE PLUME AND\r\nFAN\r\n\r\n\r\nShortly after day-light Mary was awaked by feeling Frank put his arm\r\nround her neck.  She opened her eyes, and seeing the white canvas\r\noverhead, started in surprise; then the fearful history of the preceding\r\nday rushed into her mind, and her heart beat fast at the recollection.\r\nShe put her arm softly round Frank’s neck, drew him near to her, and\r\nkissed him.\r\n\r\n\"Sister Mary,\" said he, awaking, \"is this you?  I thought it was father.\r\nWhy, sister--what house is this! O, I remember, it is our tent.\"\r\n\r\nFrank drew a long breath, nestled close to his sister, and laid his head\r\non her bosom.  He seemed to be thinking painfully.  After a minute or\r\ntwo he sprang to his feet, and began to dress.  Peeping through the\r\ncurtain that divided the two sleeping apartments, he said, \"Brother and\r\ncousin Harold are sleeping yet, shall I wake them?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" she replied.  \"They must be very weary after all their hard\r\nwork and trouble.  Let us just say our own prayers, and go out softly to\r\nlook at the boat.\"\r\n\r\nThe first thing which greeted their eyes, on coming to the open air, was\r\nNanny with her kids.  The tide had gone down during the night, leaving\r\nthe boat aground, and the hungry goat had taken that opportunity to jump\r\nout, with her little ones, and eat some fresh grass and leaves.\r\n\r\nMary’s mind, as housekeeper, turned towards breakfast. She and Frank\r\nrenewed the fire, the crackling and roar of which soon roused the\r\nothers, who joined them, and then went to the boat to see that all was\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\nNo change had occurred, other than has been noticed, except that the\r\nfulness of the dogs proved that they had fed heartily upon something\r\nduring the night; and of course that they had proved unfaithful\r\nsentinels.  The sight of the boat made them sad.  It told of their\r\ndistance from home, and of the dangers through which they had passed.\r\nFor some minutes no one broke the silence; yet each knew instinctively\r\nthe other’s thoughts.  Frank finally came near to Robert, and looking\r\ntimidly into his face, said, \"Brother, do you not think that father will\r\nsend somebody after us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed; if he only knew where to send,\" Robert replied in a\r\nsoothing tone; \"and more than that, I think he would come himself.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think he _will_ send,\" said Frank; \"for I remember that after he\r\nknelt down by the landing and prayed for us, he turned to the man on\r\nhorse-back, and pointed to us; and then the man went back where he came\r\nfrom as hard as he could gallop.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, buddy,\" returned Robert, \"if father does not come after us, nor\r\nsend for us, there is one thing we can do--try to get back to him.  So\r\nthere now\"--he stooped down, and kissed him affectionately.  Then he and\r\nHarold walked together on the beach.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole morning, as on the preceding evening, Harold had been\r\nunusually grave and thoughtful. \"Robert,\" he remarked, when they were\r\nbeyond the hearing of the others, \"I have been trying ever since we rose\r\nto think what we ought to do today; but my mind cannot fix on anything,\r\nexcept what we said yesterday about being thankful, and trying to do\r\nbetter.  There is no telling how long it will be before we see Bellevue\r\nagain, or what dangers we must meet.  One thing, however, seems certain,\r\nthat we ought to try and act like good Christian people; and that part\r\nof our duty is to have some kind of worship here, as we have been used\r\nto having at your father’s.\"\r\n\r\nRobert assented, but asked, \"How can we do it?  I am not accustomed to\r\nconduct these things, nor are you.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can at least do this,\" replied Harold, whose mind was so deeply\r\nimpressed with a sense of his obligations, that he was neither afraid\r\nnor ashamed of doing his duty.  \"We can read a chapter, verse about,\r\nmorning and evening, and repeat the Lord’s prayer together.\"\r\n\r\nThis was so easy, so natural, and so proper, that it was without\r\nhesitation agreed to.  Mary and Frank were informed of it, and it was\r\nimmediately put into practice. They gathered round the fire; and as the\r\nmurmur of their prayer ascended from that solitary beach, the\r\nconsciousness that this was _their own_ act of worship, without the\r\nintervention of a minister, who is the priest of the sanctuary, or of a\r\nparent, who is the priest of the household, imparted a deep solemnity to\r\ntheir tones and feelings.\r\n\r\nScarcely had they risen from their knees, before Nanny and her kids were\r\nseen to run bleating down the bluff, while Mum and Fidelle, having\r\nrapidly ascended at the first alarm, gave signs of more than usual\r\nexcitement. The boys hurried up the sandy steep, gun in hand, and looked\r\nin every direction.  Nothing was to be seen, but Fidelle’s tail was\r\ndropped with fear, and Mum’s back was bristling with rage.\r\n\r\n\"What can be the matter with the dogs?\" asked Robert.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" Harold replied.  \"But we can soon find out.  Here, Mum,\r\nhie on!\"\r\n\r\nHe gave the sign of pursuit, and the two dogs ran together, and began\r\nbarking furiously at something in an immense mossy live oak near at\r\nhand.  The boys stood under the tree, and scrutinized every branch and\r\nmossy tuft, without discovering anything except a coal black squirrel,\r\nthat lay flat upon a forked limb.  \"You foolish beasts!\" exclaimed\r\nHarold, \"did you never see a black squirrel before, that you should be\r\nso badly frightened at the sight of one?\" then levelling his rifle at\r\nits head, he brought it down.  It was very fat, having fed upon the\r\nsweet acorns of the live oak, and appeared also to be young and tender.\r\nHarold took it back to the tent, as an addition to their dinner,\r\nremarking, \"It is the sweetest meat of the woods.\"  All admired its\r\nglossy black skin, and Frank begged for the rich bushy tail, that he\r\nmight wear it as a plume.  This little diversion, though trifling in\r\nitself, exerted a very cheering effect upon the elastic spirits of the\r\nyoung people, and made them for a time forget their solitude and\r\ncomparative helplessness.  Had they known the country as well then as\r\nthey had occasion to know it afterwards, they would not have felt so\r\nquiet, or have been so easily satisfied, when they saw the signs of\r\nalarm in their brutes.\r\n\r\nWhen they sat down to their simple breakfast, it made Frank laugh to see\r\nhow awkward everything appeared.  There was no table, and of course\r\nthere were no chairs.  All sat on their heels, except Mary, who being\r\nthe lady was dignified with a seat upon a log, covered with a folded\r\ncloak.  It was a regular marooning breakfast.\r\n\r\n\"I think that our first business this morning is to look for water,\"\r\nremarked Harold, while they were sitting together.  \"The goat seems to\r\nbe very thirsty, and, as our jug is half empty, it will not be long\r\nbefore we shall be thirsty too.  But how shall we manage our company?\r\nShall Mary and Frank continue at the tent, or shall we all go together?\"\r\n\r\n\"O together, by all means,\" said Mary, speaking quickly.  \"I do not like\r\nthe way those dogs looked before breakfast; they frightened me.  There\r\nmay not be anything here to hurt us, but if there should be, what could\r\nFrank and I do to help ourselves?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then together let us go,\" Robert decided.  \"And Frank, as you have\r\nnothing else to do, we will make you _dipper master_.\"\r\n\r\nThey ascended the bluff, and looked in every direction, to ascertain if\r\npossible where they might obtain what they wished; but nowhere could\r\nthey discern the first sign or promise of water.  Far to the south as\r\nthe eye could reach, the country looked dry and sandy. Eastward extended\r\nthe river, or arm of the sea, but it appeared to have no current, other\r\nthan the daily tides, and its shore gave no indication of being indented\r\nby rivulets, or even by the rains.\r\n\r\n\"It will put us to great inconvenience if we are not able to obtain\r\nfresh water,\" remarked Harold.  \"We shall be compelled to move our\r\nquarters without delay, for our supply cannot last long.  However, there\r\nis no such thing as not trying.  Which way shall we move?\"\r\n\r\n\"Towards the sea,\" replied Robert.  \"There is one fact about a sandy\r\ncoast, that perhaps you have had no occasion to know--that _oftentimes\r\nour best water is found on the open beach, just about high-water mark_.\r\nI have heard father explain this fact by saying that rain water is\r\nlighter than that which is salt; and that the rain probably filters\r\nthrough the sandy soil of the coast, and finds its vent just above the\r\nordinary surface of the sea. I think, therefore, our best chance for\r\nfinding fresh water is on the seashore, in the sand.\"\r\n\r\nThey had not proceeded far along the bluff before they heard a loud\r\nrushing in the air, and looking up they saw what Mary and Frank supposed\r\nto be a gang of enormously large buzzards, flying rapidly towards the\r\nforest, and passing very near them.  \"What can they be!\" inquired\r\nRobert, in momentary doubt.  \"Really, Harold, they are turkeys! wild\r\nturkeys!\"\r\n\r\nBut as he uttered the words \"wild turkeys,\" bang! went Harold’s rifle,\r\nand down fluttered a gobler, with his wing broken.  \"Here, Mum!\" he\r\nshouted; but Mum knew his business too well to need exhortation, for by\r\nthe time the bird had scrambled to its legs Mum had seized and held it,\r\nuntil Harold put an end to its struggles by cutting off its head.\r\n\r\n\"Here now is a fine dinner,\" said he, lifting it, \"only feel how heavy;\r\nhe is rolling fat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed,\" replied Robert; \"and that was a quick shot of yours, Mr.\r\nHarold--with a rifle too.  I wonder I did not think sooner of shooting;\r\nbut in truth I was in doubt what they were, and also astonished at their\r\nnumber.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a lovely fan his tail will make!\" exclaimed Mary, examining the\r\nrich stripes of black and brown that marked the end of the feathers.\r\n\"We must be sure to carry it home for--,\" she was going to say \"mother\r\nwhen she comes,\" but the thought of their forlorn condition came over\r\nher, and she added softly--\"if we ever get there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us leave the turkey, hanging in this tree to bleed, until we\r\nreturn,\" said Harold; \"we must look for water now.\"\r\n\r\nThey returned to the beach, and walked along the smooth hard sands.  The\r\ntide, or rather \"half tide\" (as it is called on that coast), having an\r\nebb and flow, each of three hours, was nearly down, and they had a full\r\nopportunity for the proposed search.\r\n\r\n\"There is water somewhere here about, you may be sure,\" said Harold,\r\npointing to tracks of the dogs, made during the night, and partly\r\nobliterated by the tide. \"Our dogs passed here last night before high\r\nwater, and they look as if they had had plenty both to eat and to\r\ndrink.\"\r\n\r\nA quarter of a mile’s walk brought them to a place, when Robert called\r\nout, \"Here is the water! and here are our dogs’ tracks, all about and in\r\nit.  Get out you Mum!--begone Fidelle!\" he added, as the dogs trotted\r\nup, intending to drink again.  The water was good, and in great\r\nabundance.  They quenched their thirst, and were preparing to return for\r\nthe bucket to carry home a supply, when Harold suggested to pursue the\r\ntracks of the dogs a little further, and learn what they had obtained to\r\neat.  \"I perceive not far off,\" said he, \"what appears to be an oyster\r\nbank, but do dogs eat oysters?\"\r\n\r\nThey proceeded to the spot, and found a large bank of uncommonly fine\r\noysters.  It was an easy task for those who knew how to manage it, to\r\nbreak the mouth of one with another and to cut the binding muscle with a\r\npocket-knife.  Harold shrunk aghast at the idea of eating an oyster\r\nalive; but Robert’s example was contagious, and the assurance that this\r\nprimitive mode of eating them was the most delicious, sufficed to make\r\nevery one adopt it.  Engaged in selecting some of the finest specimens\r\nto carry back, the others heard Frank call out, in one of his peculiarly\r\nmerry exclamations:\r\n\r\n\"Ohdy! dody!  Look here!  There is a big, black cat’s foot in this\r\noyster’s mouth.  I wonder if the cat bit off his own foot!\"\r\n\r\nThey hurried to the spot, Mary and Harold laughing at the odd fancy, as\r\nthey esteemed it, of a cat biting off its own foot, and saw, not a cat’s\r\nfoot indeed, but that of a raccoon, firmly fastened in the oyster’s\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n\"What does this mean?\" Harold inquired, with wonder.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Harold,\" replied Robert, \"did you never hear of a raccoon being\r\ncaught by an oyster?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" he answered; \"but are you in earnest?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, in earnest as to there being such a report,\" he replied,\r\n\"and this I suppose is proof of its truth.  It is said that the raccoon\r\nis very fond of oysters, and that when they open their mouths, at a\r\ncertain time of tide, to feed upon the scum of the water, it slips its\r\npaw suddenly between the shells, and snatches out the oyster before it\r\nhas time to close.  Sometimes, however, the raccoon is not quick enough,\r\nand is consequently caught by the closing shells.  Such was probably the\r\ncase with this fellow; he came to the bank last night to make a meal of\r\nthe oysters, but was held fast until our dogs came up and made a meal of\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I doubt,\" said Harold, \"whether dogs ever eat raccoons.  They will\r\nhunt and worry them as they do cats and other animals, which they never\r\neat, at least never except in extremity.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I suppose,\" added Robert, \"we must account for this by another\r\nstory which is told, that a raccoon, when driven to the necessity, will\r\nactually gnaw off its own foot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" said Harold, \"this is a curiosity.  I must take this oyster to\r\nthe tent, and examine it more at my leisure.\"\r\n\r\nThe young people gathered as many oysters as they could carry in their\r\nhands, and reaching the tent about ten o’clock, began preparing them,\r\ntogether with their game, for the table.  Robert cut off the squirrel’s\r\ntail for Frank; and having drawn out the bone, without breaking the\r\nskin, inserted a tough, slender stick, so that when it was properly\r\ndried, Frank might use it as a plume.  The preparation of the turkey’s\r\ntail was undertaken by Harold.  He cut off the tail-bone, with the\r\nfeathers attached, and having removed every particle of flesh and\r\ncartilage not necessary for keeping the feathers together, he stretched\r\nit like a fan, and spread it in the ran to dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION OF PLANS--DOUBTS--DIFFERENCES OF OPINION--WHAT WAS AGREED\r\nUPON--BAKING A TURKEY WITHOUT AN OVEN--FLYING SIGNAL\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Really this is a fine country!\" said Robert, referring, with the air of\r\na feasted epicure, to the abundant marooning dinner from which he had\r\nrisen.  \"Wild turkey, squirrel, and oysters!  I doubt whether our old\r\nfriend Robinson Crusoe himself fared better than we.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a fine place indeed,\" Harold replied; \"and so long as our powder\r\nand shot last, we might live like princes.  But, Robert,\" he continued,\r\n\"it is time that we begin to determine our plan of operations.  What\r\nshall we do?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do!\" echoed Robert, \"why return home as soon as possible.  What else\r\nhave we to do?\"\r\n\r\n\"To determine how we are to return and in what direction.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I say,\" Robert replied, \"the same way that we came, only a little\r\nnearer shore.\"\r\n\r\n\"But who can tell me the course?\" Harold asked.\r\n\r\n\"Yonder,\" replied Frank, pointing to the sea.\r\n\r\n\"No, buddy,\" said Robert, \"that is only our _last_ course; we came in\r\nfrom sea.  Home is yonder,\" pointing nearly north.\r\n\r\n\"Now, I think you are both wrong,\" said Harold, \"for according to my\r\njudgment home is yonder,\" pointing nearly east.  \"At least, I recollect\r\nthat when I was working at the chain the sun was behind us, for my\r\nshadow fell in the water, and I do not recollect that we have changed\r\nour course since.  So far as I know we started west, and kept west.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would have carried us into the open gulf,\" returned Robert.\r\n\r\n\"And that is exactly where I think we are,\" Harold affirmed.\r\n\r\n\"But there are no islands in the gulf,\" argued Robert, \"nor land either,\r\nafter you leave Tampa, until you reach Mexico.  And we are surely not in\r\nMexico.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know where we are,\" said his cousin.  \"I only know that we\r\nleft home with our faces to the west, and that the water kept boiling\r\nunder our bow for ten long hours.  How fast we went, or what land we\r\nhave reached, I know no more than Frank does.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we saw islands and points of land to our left,\" Robert insisted;\r\n\"it is _impossible_ for us to be in the gulf.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then where do you suppose we are!\"\r\n\r\n\"On the coast of Florida, to the south of Tampa. There is no other place\r\nwithin reach, answering the description.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how do you know we are not on some island?\"\r\n\r\n\"We may be on an island; but if so, it is still on the Florida coast,\"\r\nRobert replied, \"for there are no islands beside these, nearer than the\r\nWest Indies, and we are surely not on any of them.\"\r\n\r\nHarold shook his head.  \"I cannot answer your reasoning, for you are a\r\nbetter scholar than I.  We may be where you suppose; and I confess that\r\nwithout your superior knowledge of geography I should never have\r\nconceived it; but still my impression is, that neither of us know well\r\nenough where we are to warrant our going far from land.  A voyage in an\r\nopen boat upon a rough sea is no trifle.  I am afraid of it.  Put me on\r\nland, and I will promise to do as much as any other boy of my age; but\r\nput me on sea, out of sight of land, and I am a coward, because I know\r\nneither where I am, nor what to do.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what shall we do?\" Robert inquired; \"we cannot stay here for ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but we can remain here, or somewhere else as safe, until we better\r\nunderstand our case,\" answered Harold.  \"And who knows but in the\r\nmeantime some vessel may pass and take us home.  One passed on\r\nyesterday.\"\r\n\r\nRobert mused awhile, and replied, \"I believe you are right as to the\r\npropriety of our waiting.  Father will certainly set all hands to work\r\nto search for us. The vessel we saw yesterday will no doubt carry to him\r\nthe news of their seeing us going in a certain direction at a certain\r\ntime.  He will be sure to search for us somewhere in this neighbourhood;\r\nand we had better on that account not move far away.\"\r\n\r\nMary and Frank were attentive, though silent listeners to this colloquy.\r\nMary’s colour went and came with every variation in their prospect of an\r\nimmediate return. She was anxious, principally, on her father’s account.\r\nHer affectionate heart mourned over the distress which she knew he must\r\nthen be feeling; but when she came to reflect on the uncertainty of\r\ntheir position, and the danger of a voyage, and also that her father had\r\nprobably ere this heard of them through the cutter, she was satisfied to\r\nremain.  Poor Frank cried bitterly, when he first learnt that they were\r\nnot to return immediately; but his cheerful nature soon rebounded, and a\r\nfew words of comfort and hope were sufficient to make him picture to\r\nhimself a beautiful vessel, with his father on board, sailing into their\r\nquiet river, and come for the purpose of taking them all home.\r\n\r\n\"Before we conclude on remaining _here_,\" said Harold. \"I think it will\r\nbe best for us to sail around the island, if it is one, and see what\r\nsort of a place it is.\"\r\n\r\nThis precaution was so just that it received their immediate assent.\r\nThey fixed upon the next morning as the time for their departure; and\r\nnot knowing how far they should go, or how long they might stay, they\r\nconcluded to take with them all that they had.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" inquired Mary, \"what shall we do with our large fat turkey?\" (a\r\npart of it only having been prepared for the table); \"shall we cook it\r\nhere, or carry it raw?\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us cook it here,\" said Harold; \"I will show you how to bake it,\r\nIndian fashion, without an oven.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the articles put up by William were a spade and a hoe.  With these\r\nHarold dug a hole in the dryest part of the beach; and, at his request,\r\nRobert took Mary and Frank to the tree above, and brought down a supply\r\nof small wood.  The hole was two and a-half feet deep and long, and a\r\nfoot and a-half wide, looking very much like a baby’s grave.  Frank\r\nlooked archly at his cousin, and asked if he was going to have a\r\n_funeral_, now that he had a grave.  \"Yes,\" replied Harold, \"a merry\r\none.\"  The wood was cut quite short, and the hole was heaped full; and\r\nthe pile being set to burning at the top, Harold said,\r\n\r\n\"There is another little piece of work to be done, which did not occur\r\nto me until digging that hole.  It is to set up a signal on the beach to\r\nattract attention from sea.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder we did not think of that before,\" remarked Robert.  \"It would\r\ncertainly have been an unpardonable oversight to have left the coast, as\r\nwe expect to do tomorrow, without leaving something to show that we are\r\nhere, or in the neighbourhood.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys went to the grove, and cutting a long straight pole, brought it\r\nto the tent, and made fast to it the sheet which before had served them\r\nas a signal; after which the company went together to the sea shore, and\r\nplanted the signal under the bluff, so that it could be distinctly seen\r\nfrom sea, but would be hidden from the land.  This place was selected\r\nfor the same reason that induced Harold to build his fire under the\r\nbluff--to avoid hostile observation.  The young people looked up sadly\r\nyet hopefully to this silent watchman, which was to tell their coming\r\nfriends that they were expected; and with many an unuttered wish turned\r\ntheir faces towards the tent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The company went together to the sea shore and planted\r\nthe signal]\r\n\r\nThe fire in the oven had by this time burnt down, but by reason of the\r\ndampness of the earth the hole was not hot enough.  Another supply of\r\nwood was put in, and while it was burning our young marooners went to\r\nthe oyster bank for another supply of oysters, then to the spring for\r\nwater, and to the tree for wood.  The labours of life were coming upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA sufficient heat having been produced by the second fire, Harold\r\nrequested Robert to clear the hole of all ashes, smoking brands, and\r\nunburnt bits of wood, while he went once more to the grove.  He returned\r\nwith a clean white stick, about a yard long, which he used as a spit for\r\nthe turkey, resting the two ends in holes made at each end of the oven.\r\n\r\nIt was now nearly dark.  The little company stood around the heated\r\nhole, admiring the simple contrivance by which their wild turkey was to\r\nbe so nicely cooked, when, to the surprise of every one, Mary burst into\r\na hearty laugh.  Harold asked what she meant.\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking,\" she replied, almost choking with laughter, \"how funny\r\nit will be tomorrow morning when you visit your grave, and come to take\r\nout your nice baked turkey, to find that the dogs had been to the\r\nfuneral before you.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a fact,\" said Harold, amused at the conceit. \"I did not think\r\nof the dogs.  But do you all come with me again for a few minutes, and I\r\nwill make the oven secure from that danger also.\"\r\n\r\nHe led the way up the bluff, hatchet in hand, and loaded all with small\r\npoles and palmetto leaves.  The poles were laid across the oven, and the\r\npalmetto leaves spread thickly above the poles.  \"I had forgotten this\r\npart of the ceremony,\" said Harold.  \"But this cover is put on not so\r\nmuch to keep the dogs out as to keep the heat in.  I will show you at\r\nbed time a surer way to manage them.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, you will tie them up, hey?\" asked Harry.\r\n\r\n\"Surely,\" he replied, \"that is the cheapest way to keep dogs from\r\nmischief.\"\r\n\r\nBuried almost hermetically in its heated cell, the turkey seasoned to\r\ntheir taste, was left to its fate for the night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULTS OF THE COOKERY--VOYAGE--APPEARANCE OF THE COUNTRY--ORANGE\r\nTREES--THE BITTER SWEET--RATTLESNAKE--USUAL SIGNS FOR DISTINGUISHING A\r\nFANGED AND POISONOUS SERPENT--VARIOUS METHODS OF TREATING A SNAKE\r\nBITE--RETURN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning sun found the young people preparing to carry their\r\nresolution into effect.  When Harold opened the oven the turkey was\r\nbaked brown as a nut, and from the now tepid hole arose an odour, so\r\ntempting, that their appetites began to clamour for an enjoyment that\r\nwas not long delayed.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast the first work to be done was packing the boat, during\r\nwhich time Harold, at the suggestion of Robert, took Frank, and made a\r\nshort tour through the surrounding forest, for the purpose of obtaining\r\na breakfast for the dogs.  The bark of the dogs and crack of a rifle\r\nsoon announced that the hunters were successful, and in less than half\r\nan hour they returned each with a rabbit, as we Americans call the hare.\r\n\"See here, brother Robert!  See here, sister Mary!\" was the merry\r\nchatter of Frank, the moment he came near.  \"I caught this myself.\r\nFidelle ran it into a hollow tree--he is a fine rabbit dog.  Mum is good\r\nfor nothing; he will not run rabbits at all, but just stood and looked\r\nat us while Fidelle was after it.  Cousin Harold would not let me smoke\r\nout the rabbit, but showed me how to get it with a switch.  Isn’t it a\r\nnice fellow?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is indeed,\" replied Robert, \"and I think that before we can return\r\nhome, you will make an excellent _supercargo_.\"\r\n\r\nScarcely a smile followed this allusion; it was too sadly associated\r\nwith the painful events of their forced departure from home.  The\r\npacking completed, they called in the dogs and goats, pushed from shore,\r\nraised their sails to a favourable breeze, and moved gaily up the river.\r\n\r\nFor a mile and a half the water over which they sailed, lay in a\r\nstraight reach, due east and west, then turned rapidly round to the\r\nnorth, where its course could be traced for many a mile by the breaks\r\namong the mangroves.  Just where the river made its turn to the north, a\r\nsmall creek opened into it from the south.  The course of this creek was\r\nvery serpentine; for a considerable distance hugging the shore in a\r\nclose embrace, then running off for a quarter or half a mile, and after\r\nenclosing many hundred acres of marsh, returning to the land, within a\r\nstone’s throw of the place which it had left.\r\n\r\nAs the object of the voyagers was to explore the land, they turned into\r\nthis creek, which seemed to form the eastern boundary of the island.\r\nThey observed that the vegetation which was very scant and small near\r\nthe sea, increased rapidly in variety and luxuriance as they proceeded\r\ninland.  Tall palmettoes, pines, hickories, oaks, tulip trees,\r\nmagnolias, gums, bays, and cypresses, reared aloft their gigantic forms,\r\ntheir bases being concealed by myrtles, scarlet berried cascenas, dwarf\r\npalmettoes, gallberries, and other bushes, intermingled with bowers of\r\nyellow jessamine, grape-vine, and chainy brier; while a rich grass,\r\ndotted with variously coloured flowers, spread like a gorgeous carpet\r\nbeneath the magnificent canopy.  Some of the flowers that glistened,\r\neven at this late season, above the floor of this great Gothic temple,\r\nwere strikingly beautiful.\r\n\r\nFor five miles they followed the meanderings of the creek, now rowing,\r\nnow sailing, until at last it turned suddenly to the east, and dividing\r\ninto a multitude of small innavigable branches became lost in the\r\nmarshes beyond.  Fortunately, however, for the explorers, the channel\r\nterminated at an excellent landing-place, which was made firm by sand\r\nand shells, and where, securing their boat to a projecting root, they\r\nwent ashore to examine the character of the country.  To their surprise\r\nthey had not proceeded twenty paces before discovering that this piece\r\nof land was only a narrow tongue, not a half furlong wide, and that\r\nbeyond it was a river in all respects like the one they had left, coming\r\nalso close to the opposite bank, and making a good landing on that side.\r\n\r\n\"O, for strength to lift our boat over this portage!\" exclaimed Robert.\r\n\"The river, no doubt, sweeps far around, and comes back to this point,\r\nmaking this an island.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can settle that question tomorrow,\" said Harold. \"It is too late to\r\nattempt it now.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, brother,\" cried Mary, \"there is an orange tree--look! look!\r\nlook!--full of ripe yellow oranges.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a beautiful tree, and not one only, but a cluster of seven,\r\nscattered in a kind of grove, and loaded with fruit, in that state of\r\nhalf ripeness in which the dark green of the rind shows in striking\r\ncontrast with the rich colour called orange.  The young people threshed\r\ndown several of the ripest, and began to eat, having first forced their\r\nfingers under the skin, and peeled it off by patches.  But scarcely had\r\nthey tasted the juicy pulp, before each made an exceeding wry face, and\r\ndashed the deceptive fruits away, as if they had been apples of Sodom,\r\nbeautiful without, but ashes within. The orange was of the kind called\r\nthe \"bitter sweet,\" having the bitter rind and membranes of the sour,\r\nwith the pleasant juice of the sweet.\r\n\r\n\"Open the plugs, all of you, and eat it as you do the shaddock, without\r\ntouching the skin to your lips,\" said Robert.  \"There is nothing bitter\r\nin the _juice_, I recollect now that this kind of orange is said to grow\r\nplentifully in many parts of South Florida, and also that the lime is\r\napt to be found in its company.  This is another proof, Harold, that I\r\nam right as to our whereabouts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" said Harold, \"this is a splendid country. I have another fact\r\nabout it that you will be glad to learn, and that I intended as a\r\npleasant surprise to you ere long.  There are plenty of _deer_ here.  I\r\nsaw their signs all through the woods this morning, within a quarter of\r\na mile of the tent.\"\r\n\r\nThey gathered about a bushel of the ripest looking of the fruit, and\r\ndeposited them in the boat; then beginning to feel hungry, they seated\r\nthemselves on a green mound of velvet-like moss at the foot of a\r\nspreading magnolia, and there dined.  Nanny and her kids were already on\r\nshore, cropping the rich grass, and the dogs were made happy with the\r\nremaining rabbit.\r\n\r\nShortly after dinner, while the boys were cutting a supply of grass for\r\ntheir goats during the voyage of the following day, they heard the bark\r\nof Fidelle and the growling of Mum, uttered in such decided and angry\r\ntones as to prove that they had something at bay, with which they were\r\nparticularly displeased. \"One of us ought to go and see what those dogs\r\nare about,\" remarked Robert; \"and since you took your turn this morning,\r\nI presume it is my business now.\"  He had not gone long, before Harold\r\nsaw him returning with rapid steps.\r\n\r\n\"Do come here, cousin,\" said he, \"there is the largest king-snake I ever\r\nsaw, and desperately angry.  The dogs have driven him into a thicket of\r\nbriers, and he is fighting as if he had the venom of a thousand serpents\r\nin his fangs.  His eyes actually flash.  I cut a stick and tried to kill\r\nhim, but it was too short, and he struck at me so venomously, that I\r\nconcluded to cut me a longer one.  The most curious part of the business\r\nis, that there is a large grasshopper or locust (if I may judge from the\r\nsound), in the same thicket, making himself very merry with the fight.\r\nThere he is now--do you not hear him? singing away as if he would crack\r\nhis sides.\"\r\n\r\n\"Locust!\" exclaimed Harold, as soon as his quick ear distinguished the\r\ncharacter of the music, \"you do not call that a locust.  Why, Robert, it\r\nis the rattle of a rattle-snake.  Did you never hear one before?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never in my life,\" he replied.  \"I have often seen their skins and\r\nrattles, but never a live rattle-snake. O, Harold,\" he said, shuddering,\r\n\"what a narrow escape I have made.  That fellow struck so near me twice,\r\nas barely to miss my clothes.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys obtained each a pole of ten feet in length. They stood on\r\nopposite sides of the narrow thicket in which the venomous reptile was\r\nmaking its defence, and as it moved, in striking, to the one side or the\r\nother, they aimed their blows, until it was stunned by a fortunate\r\nstroke from Robert, and fell writhing amid the leaves and herbage.  The\r\nmoment the blow took effect, Mum, whose eyes were lighted with fiery\r\neagerness, sprang upon the body, seized it by the middle, shook it\r\nviolently, then dropped and shook it again.  It was now perfectly dead.\r\nThey drew it out, and stretched it on the ground.  Its body was longer\r\nthan either of theirs, and as large around as Robert’s leg.  The fangs,\r\nwhich he shuddered to behold, were half as long as his finger, and\r\ncrooked, like the nails of a cat, and the rattles were sixteen in\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\n\"This is an old soldier,\" said Harold; \"he is seventeen or eighteen\r\nyears of age.  Had we not better carry it to the boat that Mary and\r\nFrank may see it?  It is well for all to be able to distinguish a\r\nrattle-snake when it is met.\"\r\n\r\nThe precaution was necessary.  For though Mary had a salutary fear of\r\nall reptiles, Frank had not; he would as soon have played with a snake,\r\nas with a lizard or a worm; and these last he would oftentimes hold in\r\nhis hand, admiring what he considered their beauty.  They stretched it\r\non the earth before the children; put it into its coil ready for\r\nstriking; opened its mouth; showed the horrid fangs; and squeezing the\r\npoison bag, forced a drop of the green liquid to the end of the tooth.\r\n\r\n\"Frank,\" said Harold, \"if you meet a snake like this, you had better let\r\nhim alone.  Rattle-snakes never run at people.  They are very peaceable\r\nand only trouble those that trouble them.  But they will not budge out\r\nof their way for a king; and if you wrong them, they will give you the\r\npoint of their fangs, and a drop of their poison, and then you will\r\nswell up and die.  Do you think that you will play with snakes any\r\nmore!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed,\" he replied.\r\n\r\n\"Harold,\" said Robert, \"do you know how to distinguish a poisonous snake\r\nfrom a harmless one?\"\r\n\r\nOn his replying in the negative, Robert continued, \"The poisonous\r\nserpents, I am told, may be usually known by their having broad angular\r\nheads, and short stumpy tails.  That rattlesnake answers exactly to the\r\ndescription, and I wonder at myself for not having put my knowledge to\r\nbetter use when I met him.  The only exception to this rule I know of is\r\nthe spreading adder, which is of the same shape, but harmless.\r\nPoisonous serpents must have fangs, and a poison bag.  These must be\r\nsomewhere in the head, without being part of the jaws themselves.  This\r\naddition to the head gives to it a broad corner on each side, different\r\nfrom that of a snake which has no fangs.  But _if ever you see a thick\r\nset snake with a broad head and a short stumpy tail, take care_.\"\r\n\r\nThe conversation now turned upon the subject of snake-bites and their\r\ncure.  \"My father,\" said Harold, \"had two negroes bitten during one\r\nsummer by highland moccasins, and each was cured by a very simple\r\nremedy.  In the first case the accident happened near the house, and my\r\nfather was in the field.  He sent a runner home for a pint bottle of\r\nsweet oil, and made him drink by little and little the whole.  Beside\r\nthis there was nothing done, and the negro recovered.  The other case\r\nwas more singular.  Father was absent, and there was no oil to be had,\r\nbut the overseer cured the fellow _with chickens_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Chickens!\" exclaimed Mary, laughing.  \"Did he make him take them the\r\nsame way?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly,\" Harold answered; \"he used them as a sort of poultice.  He\r\nordered a number of half grown fowls to be split open alive, by cutting\r\nthem through the back, and applied them warm to the wound.  Before the\r\nfirst chicken was cold, he applied another, and another, until he had\r\nused a dozen.  He said that the warm entrails sucked out the poison.\r\nWhether or not this was the true reason, the negro became immediately\r\nbetter; and it was surprising to see how green the inside of the first\r\nfew chickens looked, after they had lain for a little while on the\r\nwound.\"\r\n\r\n\"_We_ also had a negro bitten by a ground rattle,\" said Robert, \"and\r\nfather cured him by using hartshorn and brandy, together with an empty\r\nbottle.\"\r\n\r\nHarold looked rather surprised to hear of the empty bottle, and Robert\r\nsaid, \"O, that was used only as a cupping-glass.  Hot water was poured\r\nin, and then poured out, and as the air within cooled, it made the\r\nbottle suck very strongly on the wound, to which it was applied, and\r\nwhich father had opened more widely by his lancet.  While this operation\r\nwas going on, father made the fellow drink brandy enough to intoxicate\r\nhim, saying that this was the only occasion in which he thought it was\r\nright to make a person drunk.  The hartshorn, by-the-by, was used on\r\nanother occasion, when there was neither a bottle nor spirit to be had.\r\nIt was applied freely to the wound itself, and also administered by a\r\nquarter of a teaspoonful at a time in water, until the person had taken\r\nsix or eight doses.  I recollect hearing father say that all animal\r\npoisons are regarded as _intense acids_, for which the best antidotes\r\nare alkalies, such as hartshorn, soda saleratus, and even strong lye.\"\r\n\r\n\"Last year,\" said Harold, \"I was myself bitten by a water-moccasin.  I\r\nwas far from home, and had no one to help me; but I succeeded in curing\r\nmyself, without help.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed! how was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had gone to a mill-pond to bathe, and was in the act of leaping into\r\nthe water, when I trod upon one that lay asleep at the water’s edge.\r\nAlthough it is more than a year since, I have the feeling under my foot\r\nat this moment as he twisted over and struck me. Fortunately his fangs\r\ndid not sink very deep, but there was a gash at the joint of my great\r\ntoe, of at least half an inch long.  I knew in a moment that I was\r\nbitten, and as quickly recollected hearing old Torgah say, that the\r\nIndian cure for a bite is to lay upon the wound the liver of the snake\r\nthat makes it.  But I suppose that my snake had no notion of being made\r\ninto a poultice for his own bite; for though I chased him, and tried\r\nhard to get his liver, he ran under a log and escaped.  Very likely if I\r\nhad succeeded in killing him, I might have relied upon the Indian cure\r\nand been disappointed.  As it was, I jumped into the water, washed out\r\nthe poison as thoroughly as possible, and having made my foot perfectly\r\nclean, I sucked the wound until the blood ceased to flow.\"\r\n\r\n\"And did not the poison make you at all sick?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not in the least.  My foot swelled a little, and at first stung a great\r\ndeal.  But that was the end of it.  I was careful to swallow none of the\r\nblood, and to wash my mouth well after the sucking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do, if you please, stop talking about snakes,\" said Mary, \"I begin to\r\nsee them wherever I look; suppose we return to our old encampment.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys gathered the remainder of the hay, called Nanny and the dogs,\r\nand reached the place which they had left, about five o’clock in the\r\nafternoon--having seen no signs of human habitation, and being\r\nexceedingly pleased with the appearance of their island; they made a\r\nslight alteration, however, in the place of their tent.  Instead of\r\ncontinuing on the beach, they pitched it upon the bluff near the spring,\r\nand under the branches of a large mossy live oak.  By the time the\r\nduties of the evening were concluded, they were ready for sleep. They\r\ncommitted themselves once more to the care of Him who has promised to be\r\nthe Father of the fatherless, and laid down in peace, to rest during\r\ntheir third night upon the island.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nDISAPPOINTMENT--THE LIVE OAK--UNLOADING--FISHING EXCURSION--HAROLD’S\r\nSTILL HUNT--DISAGREEABLE MEANS TO AN AGREEABLE END\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore sunrise it was manifest that, without a change in the wind, the\r\nexcursion proposed for that day was impossible; a strong breeze was\r\nblowing directly from the east, and brought a ceaseless succession of\r\nmimic billows down the river.  Hoping, however, that the wind might\r\nchange or moderate, they resolved to employ the interval in transferring\r\nall their articles of value from the boat, to their new home under the\r\noak.  And it was indeed fortunate, as they afterwards had occasion to\r\nknow, that they attended to this duty so soon.\r\n\r\nThe live oak, under which their tent was pitched, was a magnificent\r\ntree.  Its trunk was partially decayed from age, and the signs of\r\nsimilar decay in many of the larger limbs was no doubt the cause of its\r\nbeing spared in the universal search along this coast for ship timber;\r\nbut it was so large, that the four youngsters by joining hands could\r\nbarely reach around it.  Ten feet above the root, it divided into three\r\nmassive branches, which in turn were subdivided into long pendant boughs\r\nextending about sixty feet in every direction, and showing, at their\r\nends, a strong disposition to sweep the ground.  The height of the tree\r\ndid not correspond to its breadth.  It is characteristic of the live oak\r\nthat, after attaining the moderate height of forty or fifty feet, its\r\ngrowth is directed laterally; the older trees often covering an area of\r\nmore than double their height. Every limb was hung so plentifully with\r\nlong gray moss, as to give it a strikingly venerable and patriarchal\r\naspect, and Harold declared he could scarcely look at it without a\r\ndisposition to take off his hat.\r\n\r\nAt noon Harold proposed to Robert that, the wind having ceased, they\r\nshould spend the afternoon either in hunting or fishing.  \"If,\" said he,\r\n\"Mary and Frank will allow us to leave them, I propose the first; if\r\nnot, I propose the last, in which all can join.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, let us go together, by all means,\" said Mary. \"I do not like to be\r\nleft alone in this far off place; something may happen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let it be fishing,\" said Harold; \"but what shall we use for bait?\"\r\n\r\n\"The old bait that our grandfathers used--shrimp,\" replied Robert.  \"I\r\nobserved on yesterday a multitude of them in a nook of the creek near\r\nthe river.  We can first catch some of these with our scoop net, and\r\nthen try for whatever may bite.  At any rate we can take the offals of\r\nthe turkey, and fish for crabs.\"\r\n\r\nHowever, on ascending the river in their boat, and making the trial,\r\nthey found that the shrimp had disappeared, and they were left with only\r\nsix or seven caught at a venture.\r\n\r\n\"This is a dull prospect,\" said Harold, whose active nature made him\r\nimpatient of fishing as an amusement, unless the success was unusually\r\ngood.  \"If you will allow me to go ashore I will try my luck with the\r\ngun.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly, certainly,\" was the reply; though Robert added, \"You must\r\nremember that this is a wild country, Harold, and that we had better\r\nkeep within hearing at least of each other’s guns.\"\r\n\r\nHarold promised not to wander beyond the appointed limit; and each\r\nagreed that if help were needed, two guns should be fired in quick\r\nsuccession.\r\n\r\n\"Will you not take my double barrel?\" said Robert. \"It is loaded with\r\nduck and squirrel shot, but you can easily draw and load for deer.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you, no,\" replied Harold.  \"It is so long since I have handled\r\nanything but a rifle, that a smooth bore now would be awkward.\"\r\n\r\nThey put him ashore, then dropped anchor, and began to fish.  Mary and\r\nFrank had been long initiated into the mysteries of the art.  On the\r\npresent occasion, Robert reserved to himself the shrimp, and set them to\r\nthe easier task of fishing for crabs.  For security he tied the lines to\r\nthe thowl pins.  Crabs, as all upon the seaboard well know, are not\r\ncaught with hooks, but with bait either hooked or tied to a lie, and\r\nwith a spoon-shaped net.  The crab takes hold of the bait with its\r\nclaws, and is drawn to the surface, when the net is carefully introduced\r\nbelow.  Robert inserted his own hook through the back of a live silver\r\nfish, and threw it in the water as a bait for drum.  Soon Mary was seen\r\ndrawing up her line, which she said was very heavy.  \"There is a crab on\r\nit, brother!\" she cried, as it approached the surface; \"two crabs! two!\r\ntwo!\"  Robert was near her. He inserted the net below, and the two\r\ncaptives were soon in the boat.  \"Well done for you, Miss Mary; you have\r\nbeat us all!\"\r\n\r\nHere Frank called out suddenly, \"I have got one too! O, how heavy he is!\r\nBrother, come; he is pulling my line away!\"\r\n\r\nIt was not a crab.  Robert and he pulled together, and after\r\nconsiderable play, they found that it was an enormous cat-fish or\r\nbull-head.\r\n\r\n\"This fellow will make a capital stew for tomorrow’s dinner,\" said\r\nRobert.  \"But hold to your line, Frank, while I put the net under him\r\nalso.  I am afraid of these terrible side fins.\"\r\n\r\nThe fish had scarcely been raised over the gunwale of the boat, with the\r\nremark, \"that is a bouncer!\" when Robert noticed his own line fizzing\r\nthrough the water at a rapid rate.  He quickly loosed it from the place\r\nwhere it was tied, and payed out yard after yard as the vigorous fish\r\ndarted and struggled away; then humouring its motion by giving or taking\r\nthe line as seemed to be necessary, he at last drew it towards him, and\r\ntook it aboard.  It was a drum, the largest he had ever caught, or\r\nindeed ever seen.  It was as long as his arm, and strong enough to\r\nrequire all his art for its capture.\r\n\r\nHe loosed the hooks from the floundering fishes, and tried for more.\r\nBut they now seemed slow to bite.  He took only two others, and they\r\nwere small.  Mary, however, caught nine crabs, and Frank two.  Becoming\r\nweary of the sport, they heard afar off the sharp crack of a rifle.\r\n\r\n\"There goes Harold’s rifle!\" said Robert; \"and I warrant something has\r\nseen its last of the sun.  Let us put up our lines, and meet him at the\r\ntent.\"\r\n\r\nThe anchor was weighed, the sail spread, and in the course of half an\r\nhour they saw Harold at the landing.\r\n\r\n\"What have you brought?\" they all asked.\r\n\r\n\"O, nothing--nothing at all,\" he replied, looking at the same time much\r\npleased.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing!\" responded Robert.  \"Why we paid you the compliment of saying,\r\n’There goes Harold’s rifle! and you may be sure he has killed\r\nsomething.\"\r\n\r\n\"If _you_ have not anything, _we have_,\" boasted Frank. \"See what a big\r\nfish I caught!  Isn’t it a bouncer for a little fellow like me to catch?\r\nWhy, sir, he nearly pulled me into the water; but I pulled and pulled,\r\nand brother Robert came to help me, and we both pulled, and got him in.\r\nSee, too, what brother Robert caught--a big trout; and sister Mary, she\r\ncaught a parcel of crabs; I caught two crabs myself.  And you haven’t\r\nanything! Why, cousin Harold, are you not ashamed of yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"But you have killed something; I see it in your looks,\" said Mary,\r\nscrutinizing his countenance; \"what is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is another question,\" replied Harold.  \"You all asked me at first\r\nwhat I had brought.  Now, I _have brought_ nothing; but I have _to\r\nbring_ a deer.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, indeed, you have beat us,\" said Robert; \"but that is only what I\r\nexpected.\"\r\n\r\n\"A deer!\" exclaimed the two younger.  \"O, take us to see it!\"\r\n\r\nMooring the boat safely, they hastened with Harold to the scene of\r\nslaughter.  It was about half a mile distant. There lay a large fat\r\nbuck, with branching horns, and sleek brown sides.  Frank threw himself\r\nupon it in an ecstasy of delight; patted, hugged, and almost kissed it.\r\nMary hung back, shrinking from the sight of blood.\r\n\r\n\"O, cousin Harold,\" she cried, \"what a terrible gash your bullet has\r\nmade in the poor thing’s throat!  Just look there!\"\r\n\r\nHarold laughed.  \"That was not made by my ball, but by my knife.\r\nHunters always bleed their game, cousin, or it will not look so white,\r\ntaste so sweet, nor keep so well.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys prepared to carry it home.  Harold, taking from his bosom the\r\nhatchet, cut a long stout pole, and Robert brought some leaves of the\r\nsilk grass (the yucca filamentosa, whose long narrow leaves are strong\r\nas cords), with which the legs of the deer were tied together.  Swinging\r\nit on the pole between them, they marched homewards.\r\n\r\nBy this afternoon’s excursion they were provided with a delightful\r\nsupply of fish, crabs, and venison.  But, alas! they were compelled to\r\nbe their own butchers and cooks; and there are certain processes through\r\nwhich these delicacies must pass before being ready for the mouth that\r\nare not so agreeable.  Mary and Frank brought up the fish, and set about\r\npreparing them for supper.  They laid each upon a flat root of the tree,\r\nand with a knife scraped off the scales.  This was dirty work for a nice\r\nyoung lady, but it was necessary to the desired end.  She pshawed and\r\npshawed at it as the slimy scales adhered to her fingers, or flew into\r\nher face, but she persevered until all was done.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the fire had been mended, and water poured into their\r\nlargest pot.  When it began to boil, Mary and Frank dropped in the\r\ncrabs.  Poor creatures! it was a warm reception they met with from their\r\nnative element.  Each one gave a kick at the unwelcome sensation, and\r\nthen sunk into quiet repose, at the bottom of its iron sepulchre.  They\r\nremained boiling until their shells were perfectly red, when they were\r\ntaken out, and piled in a dish for supper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANK’S EXCUSES--CURING VENISON--MAROONING COOKERY--ROBERT’S VEGETABLE\r\nGARDEN--PLANS FOR RETURN---PREPARATION FOR THE SABBATH\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mary and Frank arose next morning, they saw the small boughs of the\r\noak hung with divided portions of venison.  The boys had so placed them,\r\nafter finishing, late at night, for the double purpose of allowing them\r\nto cool and of keeping them out of reach of the dogs.  \"Come, Frank,\"\r\nsaid Mary, \"let us make up the fire, and get things ready for\r\nbreakfast.\"  The wood was close at hand, ready cut, and nothing more was\r\nneeded for a fire than putting the pieces together, with several sticks\r\nof light wood underneath; a bright cracking blaze soon rose cheerfully\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\n\"Buddy,\" she said, \"can you not go down to the spring, and bring me some\r\nwater, while I am preparing these other things?\"\r\n\r\nBut Frank was lazy that morning, and out of humour, and the fire was so\r\ncomfortable (for the air was cool) that he stood before it, warming his\r\nhands, and puffing at the smoke that blew in his face.  He replied, \"No,\r\nsister, I am afraid\"--then he paused, trying hard to think of some\r\nexcuse.  \"I am afraid that if I go the crabs will bite me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Crabs!\" Mary exclaimed.  \"Why how can they bite you, when they are all\r\ncooked?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not mean the crabs in the dish,\" said he, \"but the crabs in the\r\nriver.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, if they are in the river,\" argued Mary, \"how can they hurt you,\r\nif you keep on the land?\"\r\n\r\nFrank found that his excuse was about to fail.  But he was not disposed\r\nto surrender so easily.  He therefore devised another.  \"I am afraid to\r\ngo, for if the crabs do not bite me maybe the snakes will.  Don’t you\r\nremember what cousin Harold told us the other day about snakes.\"\r\n\r\nFrank said this very seriously, and had not Mary been somewhat provoked\r\nat his unbrotherly refusal, she would have laughed at the ridiculous\r\ncontrast between his looks and his language.  She said, reproachfully,\r\n\"I thought, Frank, you loved me better than to treat me so.  I want the\r\nwater to make coffee for you, and the rest of us, and yet you will not\r\nhelp me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not wish any of the coffee,\" he answered.  \"All that I want for\r\nbreakfast is some of that nice fat deer, and some of these fish and\r\ncrabs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" she added, in a hurt but independent tone, \"I can help\r\nmyself.\"\r\n\r\nShe took the bucket, and went to the spring.  Frank looked ashamed, but\r\ncontinued silent.  He drew up a billet of wood and sat upon it, pushing\r\nhis feet towards the fire, and spreading out his hands, for the want of\r\nsomething else to do.  By the time Mary returned from the spring, Robert\r\nand Harold came from the tent.  They had retired late and weary the\r\nnight before, and as a natural consequence had overslept their usual\r\ntime for rising.  \"What is that we heard you and Frank talking about?\"\r\nRobert asked of Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Inquire of Frank,\" she replied; \"I prefer that he should tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Frank, what was it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing,\" he answered, doggedly, \"except that sister wanted me to go to\r\nthe spring, and I told her I was afraid that the crabs and snakes would\r\nbite me.\"\r\n\r\n\"What did sister Mary want with the water?\"\r\n\r\n\"To make coffee, I suppose.\"\r\n\r\n\"And do you not love coffee?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sometimes; but I do not wish any this morning, for sister never puts in\r\nsugar enough for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, well, we shall see who wants coffee at breakfast. Sister Mary, is\r\nthere anything I can do to help you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Cousin,\" said Harold, uniting quickly in the effort to shame Frank out\r\nof his strange caprice, \"I wish you would let me too help you in some\r\nway.  You are always so ready to do everything you can for us, that we\r\nare glad whenever we can do anything for you.\"\r\n\r\nMary needed nothing, except to have the kettle lifted to its place upon\r\nthe fire.  Frank was all this time warming his hands and feet, as if he\r\nwas desperately cold. In reading the Scriptures, and repeating the\r\nLord’s Prayer, his voice could scarcely be heard; he knew that he had\r\ndone wrong, and was beginning to repent.  At breakfast, Mary asked him\r\nin a kind, forgiving tone, if he would not have some coffee; but true to\r\nhis resolution he declined.\r\n\r\nThe first business of the day was to take care of their venison.  Yet\r\nwhat should they do with it?  They had no cool place in which to keep it\r\nfresh, nor salting tub nor barrel in which to corn or pickle what they\r\ncould not consume in its green state.  Harold’s proposal was that they\r\nshould cut the hams into thin slices, and jerk them in the smoke, as he\r\nhad seen Torgah do; or else to dry them in the sun, which in the middle\r\nof the day was quite hot.  Robert said he had heard or read of meat\r\nbeing saved fresh for several days by burying it under cool running\r\nwater, and offered to try it at their spring.  Mary said she liked both\r\nplans, but having had such good experience of Harold’s baked turkey, she\r\nhoped he would now give them a specimen of baked venison.\r\n\r\nIt was finally resolved to give each plan a fair trial. One ham should\r\nbe sliced and jerked; another should be baked for the next day’s dinner,\r\nas the turkey had been; one shoulder should be cooked for that day’s\r\nconsumption, and the other put under the drip of the spring to prove\r\nwhether it would keep until Monday.\r\n\r\n\"There is one advantage at least that we shall gain from these\r\nexperiments,\" said Harold; \"a knowledge how to economize our meat.\"\r\n\r\nFor a minute or two Mary had been evidently pondering upon some\r\ndifficult problem; and Robert, observing her abstraction, asked in a\r\njesting tone if she was studying anatomy.\r\n\r\n\"Not exactly,\" she replied; \"I was thinking of two things; how to cook\r\nthis shoulder, when we have nothing in which to bake or roast it--\"\r\n\r\n\"O, as for that,\" Harold interjected, \"I will provide you in ten\r\nminutes’ time with a roaster wide enough for an ox, or small enough for\r\na sparrow.  Do you just hang it by a string from the pole I will set for\r\nyou above the fire; it will roast fast enough, only you will lose all\r\nyour gravy.\"\r\n\r\n\"The gipsies’ roasting-pole!\" said she; \"I wonder I did not think of it.\r\nThe other thing is, that after you have sliced the steak-pieces from the\r\nbone, the remainder would make an excellent soup, if we had any\r\nvegetables to put with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what do you want?\" Robert inquired.\r\n\r\n\"In beef soup,\" she replied, \"cooks usually put in turnips, onions,\r\ncabbage, potatoes, carrots, and the like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Carrots and potatoes I fear we must do without at this time,\" said he,\r\n\"but the rest I think I can furnish, or something very like them.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! have you a vegetable garden already growing on the island?\" asked\r\nHarold.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he answered, \"a very large and fine one; an endless supply of the\r\nmost beautiful white cabbage, and most delicate asparagus, besides\r\nquantities of spinach, okra, and other vegetables.  The palmetto gives\r\nthe first, the tender shoots of the bamboo-brier the second; the leaves\r\nof the poke, when young, furnish the third, and those of the wild violet\r\nthe last, or rather a substitute in its mucilaginous leaf, for the okra.\r\nBeside these plants (all of which, except the last, need to be boiled in\r\nseveral waters to free them from their bitter taste), there are\r\nmultitudes more growing around us that are perfectly wholesome as\r\narticles of food--the purslain, the thistle, the dandelion, the\r\nlambsquarter, the cresses and pepper-grasses, to say nothing of the\r\npink-gilled mushrooms, and the fungus that grows from logs of hickory.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will ask no more questions about your garden,\" said Harold.  \"I will\r\nconfess at once that it is one of the largest and finest in the world;\r\nbut will say too that it requires a person of your knowledge to use it\r\naright.\"\r\n\r\n\"And no great knowledge after all,\" responded Robert.  \"I could teach\r\nyou in half an hour every one.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will await them here,\" said Harold, \"wishing you all success in\r\nvisiting the garden, and cousin Mary all success in preparing the\r\nvegetables for use.\"\r\n\r\nThat afternoon they engaged in another discussion about attempting a\r\nspeedy return home.  Robert and Mary had become impatient of their stay,\r\nand were despairing of any one’s coming soon to their relief.  The three\r\nand a half days of separation from their father seemed to them a month.\r\n\r\n\"Why not make the effort to return at once?\" they contended.  \"This\r\nplace is very good indeed; on some accounts we could not desire a\r\nbetter; yet it is not home.\"\r\n\r\nHarold shook his head, and replied, \"I am not sure, notwithstanding all\r\nyour arguments, that any of us know where home is.  One thing I do know,\r\nthat this island seems to be a very safe and comfortable place for\r\npeople in our condition.  Moreover, I am confident that your father will\r\nuse every means for finding us; and we can scarcely be in a better place\r\nthan this for being found.  My opinion still is that we had better\r\ncontinue here for a fortnight or three weeks in safety, than to risk\r\nwhat we should, by starting in an open boat, to go upon the broad sea,\r\nwe know not where.\"\r\n\r\nHarold, however, was overruled.  Mary and Frank united with Robert in\r\nresolving to attempt their return homewards by coasting; and Harold\r\nyielded with a sigh, remarking that his heart was with them, but his\r\njudgment against them.  The moment the question was decided, Frank began\r\nto show the greatest glee.  To his hopeful spirit, to try was to\r\nsucceed; and he was even then in fancy revelling once more in the scenes\r\nof happy Bellevue.\r\n\r\nBut when should they begin their voyage?  Not that day, for they were\r\nnot ready.  Not the next, for that was the Sabbath, which they had been\r\ntaught to reverence. Not Monday morning, because there were preparations\r\nto be made, which they could not complete without working on the\r\nSabbath, They resolved to \"remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy,\" by\r\nrest from labour, and by appropriate exercises, and then to start as\r\nsoon after as possible; which, probably, could not be before Monday\r\nevening or Tuesday morning.\r\n\r\nThey prepared another oven, heated and protected as before, into which\r\nthe ham of venison was introduced. They collected and cut a supply of\r\nwood to be used in case of cool weather the following day, and brought\r\nfrom the bank another basket full of oysters.  After spending a pleasant\r\nevening in conversation, they retired to rest, happy in the thought that\r\nthey had been trying to live as they should, and that they had resolved,\r\nof their own free will, to reverence the Sabbath, at the sacrifice of\r\nanother day from home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEIR FIRST SABBATH ON THE ISLAND, AND THE NIGHT AND MORNING THAT\r\nSUCCEEDED\r\n\r\n\r\nThe morning sun rose with uncommon beauty, and the young people having\r\nretired early to bed, were prepared for early rising.  Frank now\r\nvolunteered to aid his sister in preparing for breakfast; his repentance\r\nwas shown not by words but by deeds; and though it was only an act of\r\nduty performed towards his sister and the company, it was in part a very\r\nproper beginning in the observance of a day belonging to Him who\r\nencourages us to think that he regards whatever we do from a principle\r\nof duty to our fellow men, as being done to himself.\r\n\r\nAt the time of worship they gathered with more than usual solemnity\r\naround the accustomed place, and read the portion of Scripture for the\r\nmorning.  It was a chapter of unusual interest to them all, and\r\nparticularly so to Harold.  He had become increasingly thoughtful since\r\ntheir accident.  This morning he appeared to be more serious than ever,\r\nand once or twice, when his turn came to read, his voice was so low and\r\nunsteady, that he could scarcely be heard.  There was evidently some\r\ncause of distress to that youth of strong mind and pure life which the\r\nothers knew not.\r\n\r\nThe Sabbath passed, as may be readily conceived, without being enlivened\r\nby any incidents of a particularly interesting character.  It can\r\nscarcely be said that they did actually sanctify the Sabbath, for there\r\nwas nothing spiritual, nor even hearty in their exercises; and they\r\nthemselves felt that there was a great deficiency somewhere.\r\n\r\nTheir unmethodical though conscientious effort was useful in teaching\r\nthem to look beyond mere externals for any real good to be derived.\r\nThey learned they were imperfect even in their best performances, and\r\nwithout merit when they had done what they could.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening they went to the seashore, and sitting upon a bank\r\nof clean sand near their flag-staff, looked upon the sea from which they\r\nhad made so providential an escape, and to which they expected once more\r\nto commit themselves.  A light breeze had been blowing from the west all\r\nday, yet light as it was it had been sufficient to raise the waves, and\r\nmake them roar and break with ominous violence upon the shore.  This\r\naction of the breeze revealed to them another fact, that two or three\r\nmiles to the seaward there was a long and apparently endless chain of\r\nbreakers extending north and south, as far as the eye could reach.  They\r\ncould see the large waves gather, and the white tops sparkle with foam.\r\nHere was another cause for thankfulness. Had the present wind been\r\nblowing on the day of their accident, they could not possibly have\r\ncrossed that foaming bar; they would have been kept at sea, and been to\r\na certainty lost in the sudden squall that arose that night.\r\n\r\nBut the sight of these breakers was also a source of disquiet, in view\r\nof their intended voyage.  It was evident, as they supposed, that they\r\ncould not sail with safety, when the wind was blowing with any\r\nfreshness, either on or off the shore, on account of the rough swell,\r\ncaused by the first, and of the danger of being carried out to sea by\r\nthe last.  They conversed long and anxiously upon this new feature in\r\ntheir case; and then, by general consent, kneeled together upon the\r\nsands, in conscious helplessness, and implored Him who is the Lord of\r\nthe seas, to care for them and direct their steps.\r\n\r\nWhen they left the beach, the light of day was fading into the hues of\r\nnight; and several faint stars peeped timidly from the yet illuminated\r\nsky.  Mary and Frank retired to their room soon after dark.  The larger\r\nboys sat for some time, conversing upon their situation and prospects,\r\nwhen observing the sky to cloud rapidly with the indications of a sudden\r\nchange of weather, they went to the landing, made their boat secure as\r\npossible, and then laid down to rest.\r\n\r\nThe wind soon began to sigh in the branches of the huge oak above them.\r\nEach puff became stronger than the one before it.  They could hear the\r\nroar of the distant surf, bursting angrily over the sandy barrier, and\r\nthundering on the shore.  It was the beginning of a hurricane.  The boys\r\nsprang from their pallets, and dressing themselves hastily, seized the\r\nax and hatchet, and drove the tent-pins deeply into the ground.  While\r\nthus engaged, Nanny and her kids came up, and showed a strong\r\ndisposition to take refuge in the tent.  The dogs also gave signs of\r\nuneasiness, following them around with drooping tails, whining and\r\nshivering, as they looked with half shut, winking eyes, in the direction\r\nof the wind.  These signs of terror in their dumb companions only made\r\nthe boys work faster, and do their work more securely.  They did not\r\ncontent themselves with driving down the tent-pins; they took the logs\r\ncut for firewood, and laid them on the windward edges of the tent, to\r\nprevent the wind from entering below and blowing the canvas from above\r\ntheir heads.  Had they the time they would have laid the sails of their\r\nboat, which they had hastily unrigged, above the canvas of the tent; but\r\nere they could accomplish this, the wind burst upon them with the fury\r\nof a tornado.  The grand old tree quivered to its roots, and groaned in\r\nevery limb.  The tent fluttered and tugged at the ropes with such force\r\nthat the deeply driven pins could scarcely hold it down.  It was\r\nfortunate that it had been pitched under the oak, for the long lower\r\nbranches, which at ordinary times almost swept the ground, were strained\r\ndownwards so far, that with their loads of moss, they formed a valuable\r\nbarrier against the wind.\r\n\r\nThere was little sleeping for the boys that night. Scarcely had they\r\nentered the tent before the rain commenced.  It came in heavy drifts,\r\nand was carried with such force that, notwithstanding the protection\r\nafforded by the oak, it insinuated itself through the close threads of\r\nthe canvas, and under the edges of the tent.  Mary had been awaked by\r\nthe hammering, and Frank was now roused by the dropping of water in his\r\nface.  When Robert entered their room to see how they fared, he\r\ndiscovered them seated on a trunk, wrapped in their father’s cloak, and\r\nsheltered by that very umbrella which Frank had been provident enough to\r\nbring.  They rolled up their bedding and clothes, and protected as best\r\nthey could whatever seemed most in danger from the wet. They sat on\r\nboxes and trunks, and wrapped themselves in cloaks and blankets; but it\r\nwas in vain; they could not guard themselves at the same time from the\r\nrain above and the driven water from below.  They sat cold and shivering\r\nuntil three o’clock in the morning, when the rain ceased and the wind\r\nabated.  Then they made a fire; and just before day were enabled, by\r\nlying on trunks and boxes, to indulge themselves in a short uneasy\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nThe clear sun shone over the main land before the wearied company awoke.\r\nHarold was the first on his feet, and calling to Robert, they hastened\r\nout to see what damage had been done.  Mary also joined them, followed\r\nby Frank; for having dressed themselves during the night, they had no\r\nfurther toilet to make.\r\n\r\nIn every direction were to be seen traces of the storm; prostrate trees,\r\nbroken branches, the ground strewed with twigs, and the thickets and\r\nvines loaded with packages of moss, torn from the taller trees.  The sea\r\nroared terribly, and thick dirty billows came rolling up the river.\r\n\r\nHarold was about to mend the fire for Mary, who said she wanted to drink\r\nsomething hot, as the best means of warming her chilled limbs, when\r\nRobert, glancing at the tremendous tide in the river, called to her\r\nquickly--\"Do not waste one drop of this water in the bucket; there is\r\nonly a quart left, and no one can tell when the tide will be down enough\r\nfor us to obtain more.\"  He ran to the bluff, and the others observed\r\nhim make a gesture of surprise, look hastily around, and finally leap\r\ndown the bank.  He was absent only two or three minutes, and then\r\nreturned with a pale face and hurrying step.\r\n\r\n\"Harold!\" said he, scarcely able to articulate, \"OUR BOAT IS GONE!\r\nBurst from her moorings!\"\r\n\r\nAt this terrible announcement, every face whitened, and there was a\r\ngeneral rush for the landing.  It was even so.  The boat was nowhere to\r\nbe seen.  The stake which had confined it had also disappeared.  Far as\r\nthe eye could reach nothing was visible but water--water, with here and\r\nthere a patch of mangrove, higher than the rest, and bowing reluctantly\r\nto the rush of the waves. They looked anxiously over the watery waste,\r\nand then into each other’s agitated faces.  It was clear that their\r\nprospect of speedily returning home was hopeless.\r\n\r\n\"But perhaps,\" said Mary, who was the first to recover speech, \"it is\r\nnot lost.  It may have only drifted up the river; or it may have sunk at\r\nthe landing.\"\r\n\r\nRobert mournfully looked, where he had already looked more than once,\r\nand said, \"Well, we can try.  But what is the use? something has been\r\nagainst us ever since we left home.  Harold, shall we search the river?\"\r\n\r\nHarold seemed lost in thought.  His keen eye had glanced in every\r\ndirection, where it was possible the boat could have been driven; then\r\nlessening in its fire, it gave evidence of deep abstraction.  Robert’s\r\nquestion recalled him, and he slowly answered, \"Yes; but it is my\r\nopinion we shall not find it.  You know I have all along had the idea\r\nthat we ought not to leave this island. It has seemed to me, ever since\r\nthe fish let go our anchor, that the hand of God was in this accident,\r\nand that we are not yet at the end of it.  I am troubled, like the rest\r\nof you; but I have also been questioning whether it is meant for our\r\nharm or for our good.  I do not think it is for harm, or we might have\r\nbeen left to perish at sea; and if it is for good, I think we ought to\r\nsubmit with cheerfulness.\"\r\n\r\nThey conversed awhile upon the bluff, in view of the dismal waters, then\r\nslowly turned towards the tent, which was now the only place on earth\r\nthey could call their home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nA SAD BREAKFAST--SAGACITY OF DOGS--SEARCH FOR THE BOAT--EXCITING\r\nADVENTURE--A PRETTY PET--UNEXPECTED INTELLIGENCE\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce more the young people assembled in their tent; once more they read\r\nthe Scriptures, and knelt together in prayer.  Their tones were humble\r\nand subdued.  They felt more deeply than ever their dependence upon an\r\narm that is stronger and farther reaching than man’s.\r\n\r\nTheir simple meal was soon ready, consisting of the most tempting bits\r\nthat Mary could select, as an enticement to their reluctant appetites.\r\nThey sat down, and endeavoured to appear cheerful, but little was said,\r\nand less was eaten.  Harold’s face was towards the marsh.  Robert\r\nobserved him fix his eye steadily upon a distant point of land, where\r\nthe opposite bluff of the river terminated on the sea.  He looked as if\r\nhe saw something unusual, but after a scrutinizing gaze of half a\r\nminute, turned away his eye, and relapsed into thought.\r\n\r\n\"Did you observe anything across the marsh?\" inquired Robert, willing to\r\nrelieve the silence.\r\n\r\n\"I thought I saw a little curl of smoke upon the point,\" he returned;\r\n\"but now suppose it was the steam from the bluff, drawn up by the sun.\r\n\r\n\"Robert,\" he continued, \"it is possible after all that we may find our\r\nboat.  If not sunk at the landing, it is certainly somewhere up the\r\nriver, in the direction of the wind.  The tide has not yet begun to ebb.\r\nIf it has lodged in the marsh, we can best see it while the water is\r\nhigh, and if it has not lodged, it may float back with the tide.\r\nSuppose we set off at once to search.\"\r\n\r\nMary’s reluctance to be left alone yielded to the necessity of the case,\r\nand begging them to be careful of themselves, and to return as soon as\r\npossible, she assumed a cheerful air, and tried to prepare them for\r\ntheir departure.\r\n\r\nThe boys promised to return by midday, unless delayed by finding the\r\nboat; and taking their guns and hatchet, together with a luncheon in\r\ncase of delay, they set out, accompanied by Mum.  Ere proceeding more\r\nthan a few steps, however, Robert stopped to say, \"Harold, we shall not\r\nneed the dogs.  Let us leave them for protectors to Mary and Frank.\r\nTrue, there is no danger; but they will feel safer for having them at\r\nhand. Frank, bring me Mum’s chain.  Here, Mum!  Here, Mum!\"\r\n\r\nMum came rather reluctantly; for dog though he was, he appeared to\r\napprehend the state of the case.  Mary observing this, exclaimed,\r\n\"Cousin, I do believe that Mum understands what brother says.  Only see\r\nhow disappointed he looks!\"\r\n\r\n\"O, yes,\" returned Harold; \"dogs understand more than most people\r\nsuspect.  He probably heard Robert use the word ’chain’; and he has\r\nheard it often enough to know what it means.  But they gather more from\r\nthe eye and tone than from words.  Mum, poor fellow, I am sorry to leave\r\nyou; for I know you love hunting better than staying at home.  But you\r\nknow nothing of hunting boats, Mum; so we want you to stay and help\r\nFidelle to guard your young mistress and master against the squirrels\r\nand opossums.  If any of them come you must bite them well; do you hear,\r\nMum?\"\r\n\r\nThe poor dog wagged his short tail mournfully, as much as to say he\r\nwould do his best; but at the same time cast a wistful look at the guns.\r\nWith a charge to Mary not to let Mum loose without necessity, and to\r\nFrank not to approach the bluff except in the company of his sister, the\r\nboys were once more on the move, when Mary inquired, \"But what shall we\r\ndo if we see the boat coming down the river, or if we need you for any\r\nother reason?\"\r\n\r\n\"True, true,\" said Robert; \"I am glad you suggested it.  We will load\r\nWilliam’s gun for you, and you must fire it for your signal.  We shall\r\nprobably be within hearing.\"\r\n\r\nRobert well knew that Mary was able to do what he proposed, for her\r\nfather had made it a part of his duty to instruct her, or cause her to\r\nbe instructed, in every art necessary to preserve and enjoy life.  For\r\nthis purpose she had learned how to load and use the several varieties\r\nof firearms--to manage a horse in harness and under the saddle--and even\r\nto swim.  Compared with most other girls she was qualified to be quite a\r\nheroine.\r\n\r\nWith many adieus and kind wishes from both sides, the boys finally set\r\noff.  They struck directly through the woods for their old fishing\r\npoint, at the junction of the creek with the river.  Standing on the\r\nmost commanding part of the bluff, they looked in every direction, but\r\nno sign of the boat appeared.  Then they turned their steps to the\r\nsoutheast, following, as closely as they could, the bank of the creek,\r\nthough compelled oftentimes to make large circuits in order to avoid the\r\nshort creeks and bay-galls that set in from the marsh.  These bay-galls\r\nare wet spongy bottoms, shaded with loblolly bays, and tangled with\r\nbriers, and the edges are usually fringed with the gall-berry bush--a\r\nshrub closely resembling the whortleberry, and bearing a black fruit of\r\nthe same size, but nauseously bitter.  Compelled to make great circuits\r\naround these miry bottoms, and interrupted by a close growth of vines\r\nand trees, the boys advanced scarcely a mile and a half to the hour.\r\nThey left not a foot of the shore unexplored; still no vestige of the\r\nboat appeared.\r\n\r\nAbout eleven o’clock they approached the tongue of land on which they\r\nhad discovered the orange trees, and where they proposed to quench their\r\nthirst with the pleasant acid of the fruit, and afterwards to return to\r\nthe tent.  They had just headed a short bay-gall, and were enjoying the\r\nfirst glimpses of the south river, when they were startled by a\r\ntrampling in the bushes before them; and a herd of six deer rushed past\r\nand disappeared in the dark bottom.  Soon after a half grown fawn, white\r\nas milk, and bleating piteously, was seen staggering through the bushes,\r\nhaving a large wildcat seated upon its shoulders, and tearing furiously\r\nat its neck.  Robert’s gun had been levelled, when the herd appeared,\r\nbut they passed too quickly for a shot; he was therefore all ready when\r\nthe fawn approached, and aiming not at it, but at the fierce creature\r\nupon its back, both animals rolled together upon the ground.  He would\r\nhave rushed immediately upon them, had he not been restrained by the\r\ngrasp of Harold.\r\n\r\n\"Not yet!\" said he, \"not yet! keep your other barrel ready, a wildcat is\r\nhard to kill, and will fight until he begins to gasp.\"\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for Robert that he was thus arrested, for the cat was\r\nonly wounded, and soon recovered sufficiently to limp away.  \"Now give\r\nhim your second barrel, Robert; give it to him in his shoulder.\"  Before\r\nhe could do so, however, the cat slipped into the hollow of a\r\nneighbouring tree.\r\n\r\n\"He is safe now,\" said Harold; \"we can kill him at our leisure.  But\r\nkeep your eye on the hole, and be ready to shoot, while I attend to this\r\nfawn.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Harold took hold of the beautiful little creature, he discovered\r\nthat the wounds were very slight.  The ball had penetrated the back of\r\nthe head and stunned it, without touching any vital part, and it was\r\nbeginning to recover; the wounds made by the wildcat were only skin\r\ndeep, and could easily be healed.\r\n\r\n\"Shall I bleed it for venison?\" asked Harold, \"or save it as a pet for\r\nMary and Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, save it by all means,\" replied Robert, whose sympathies had been\r\nfrom the first excited by the piteous, childlike tones of the fawn.\r\n\"Save it for sister, and let us make haste to finish this beast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then lend me your handkerchief,\" said Harold; \"mine alone is not\r\nsufficient for both collar and cord.\"\r\n\r\nRobert approached him for the purpose, when he observed the cat creep\r\nslyly from his hole, and hobble away with all haste.  \"Quick, Harold,\"\r\ncried Robert, tossing him the handkerchief, \"tie the fawn, and follow\r\nme,\" then dashed through the bushes in pursuit.\r\n\r\n\"Take care, you may get too near,\" Harold shouted; but Robert was\r\nalready lost to sight behind the underwood.  By the time the fawn was\r\nsecured, Harold heard him hallooing about one hundred paces away, and\r\ngoing rapidly in that direction, saw him watching the convulsive throes\r\nof the wild creature as it lay gasping on the ground.\r\n\r\nHarold looked on and pleasantly remarked, \"You will soon get your name\r\nup for a hunter, if you keep improving at this rate.  That is a splendid\r\ncat!  What claws and teeth!  Let us see how long he is.\"  Putting his\r\nhands together at the thumbs, and spreading them out to span a foot, he\r\nascertained that it measured two feet nine inches from the nose to the\r\nroot of the short tail; and that, standing with its head erect, it must\r\nhave been fully two and a half feet high.  Its teeth and nails were\r\nsavage looking things.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad he did not fasten those ugly looking things in my leg,\" said\r\nRobert; \"but I was so excited by the pursuit, that I rushed at one time\r\nalmost upon him.  He had stopped behind a bush; all at once he sprang at\r\nme with a growl, showing his white teeth, bristling his hair, and\r\nglaring at me with his large fierce eyes.  He dodged behind another\r\nbush, and when I next saw him he was gasping and convulsed as when you\r\ncame up.\"\r\n\r\n\"It would have been a desperate fight, if he had seized you,\" remarked\r\nHarold; \"you would have borne the marks to the end of your life.\"\r\n\r\nReturning to the fawn, which struggled violently on their approach, they\r\nsoon succeeded in allaying its terror by gentle tones and kind\r\ntreatment.  It yielded passively to its fate, and consented to be led\r\nwherever they chose.\r\n\r\nThe oranges were delicious after their long walk, and now excessive\r\nthirst.  A few minutes served to rest their weary limbs, and they had\r\njust begun to discuss the propriety of returning to the tent, when the\r\nfawn pricked up its ears with the signs of renewed alarm, a neighbouring\r\nbush was agitated, and ere they could fully grasp their guns and spring\r\nto their feet, Mum came dashing up at full speed.\r\n\r\nThe boys were much surprised, and were afraid some accident had\r\nhappened.  Mum, however, showed no signs of anything wrong; he came up\r\nwagging his cropped tail, and looking exceedingly pleased.  He cast a\r\nhungry look at the fawn, as though his mouth watered for a taste, but he\r\noffered no interference.  On close inspection, Harold observed a string\r\ntied round his neck, to which was fastened a little roll of paper.  He\r\nhastily took it off, and calling to Robert, they read these lines in\r\npencil:\r\n\r\n\"Come home quickly.  I see some one across the river; he is waving a\r\nflag.  Mary.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nMARY AND FRANK--EXAMINATION OF THE TENT--SMOKE SIGNALS--DEVICES--BRUTE\r\nMESSENGER--RAPT--BLAZING THE TREES--VOYAGE--DISASTROUS EXPEDITION--NEWS\r\nFROM HOME--RETURN TO THE TENT\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Robert and Harold left the tent that morning, to look for the lost\r\nboat, Mary and Frank watched with anxious eyes their retiring forms.  It\r\nwas painful to be left alone in that vast solitude.  But the act was\r\nnecessary, and Mary resolved to bear it with cheerfulness.  In order\r\ntherefore to withdraw their minds from their situation, she proposed to\r\nFrank to join her in exposing to the sun those articles in the tent\r\nwhich had been wet by the rain.\r\n\r\nAmong these was a bundle of William’s.  \"Poor William!\" said Frank, \"I\r\nwonder what became of him. Don’t you think, sister, he was drowned?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know, buddy,\" she answered with a sigh; \"though I presume not.\r\nWilliam was a good swimmer, and near shore.  O, I do wish we could hear\r\nfrom our dear father, and he could hear from us!  See here, Frank.\"  She\r\npointed to a valise-trunk.  \"This is father’s, it contains his razors,\r\nand all the little things that he uses every day.  I wish I could open\r\nit, and air everything for him; both top and bottom seem to be wet.\"\r\n\r\nShe tried the various keys in her bunch, and to her delight found one\r\nthat fitted the lock.  Some of its contents were quite damp, and no\r\ndoubt they were saved from serious injury by her affectionate care.  In\r\nit she spied a morocco case, which proved quite useful in the end; it\r\nwas a case of choice medicines.  Mary was careful to disturb nothing,\r\nexcept so far as was needful for its preservation; for, though her\r\nfather had no concealments that she knew of, this was his private\r\nproperty, and she held its privacy sacred.  After drying everything in\r\nit, they were replaced as before.\r\n\r\nThis work had occupied them about two hours, when Frank, whose eyes were\r\ncontinually directed towards the sea, with a lingering hope that he\r\nmight see his father sailing after them, exclaimed, \"Sister, is not that\r\na smoke across the river?\"\r\n\r\nFrom the bluff where, three miles distant, the opposite bank of the\r\nriver overhung the sea, a bluish vapour was curling upward.  It was\r\nevidently a smoke.  Mary gazed at it with feelings both of hope and\r\ndistrust. Who made it?  What did it mean?  She ran for the spy glass,\r\ndrew it to its focus, steadied her trembling hands against a tree,\r\ndirected it towards the point, and almost instantly exclaimed, \"Some\r\nperson is there.  I can see a signal flying, like a handkerchief tied to\r\na pole.  But who can it be?  If it is one of our people, why does he not\r\ncome over?  O Frank, how I wish brother and cousin Harold were here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us fire off the gun, sister,\" Frank replied, \"that will bring them\r\nback.\"\r\n\r\nThey took the gun, loaded by Robert for the purpose, and fired it\r\nrepeatedly.  Mary then took another peep through the glass, and cried\r\nout--\"He sees us, Frank, whoever it is; he is waving his flag.  He must\r\nhave heard our guns, or seen their smoke.  I wonder I cannot see him.\r\nO, yes, there he is, lying on the ground, or half lying.  Now he has put\r\ndown the flag, and I can see him dragging himself along the ground by\r\none arm.  What can it mean?  O, when will brother Robert and cousin\r\nHarold come back!\"\r\n\r\nMary’s impatience made the time seem very long.  She employed herself in\r\nevery way that she could devise for an hour, and then, turning to Frank\r\nwith a bright look, clapped her hands joyfully, and said, \"I have it!\r\nI’ll bring them back!  I mean to send a runner after them. I can do\r\nit--O, yes, I can do it!\"\r\n\r\nFrank looked troubled.  \"How can you?\" he inquired.  \"I am the only one\r\nyou have; and I am sure I cannot find the way any more than you can.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not you, nor myself,\" she said; \"but one that I know can find them,\r\nand can take a note to them too.\"  She opened her trunk, took out a\r\npiece of paper, pencilled upon it the note recorded in the last chapter,\r\ntied it tightly with a string, which she fastened around Mum’s neck, and\r\nsaid, \"Here is my messenger!  He will find them, I warrant.\"  Then\r\nloosening the chain, she said, \"Hie on, Mum! hie on!\"\r\n\r\nMum looked at her inquisitively, and was evidently in doubt what to make\r\nof her command.  She called him to the track of the boys, pointed to it,\r\nfollowed it for a few steps, and encouraged him to proceed, when the\r\nintelligent brute took the meaning, and with a whine of joy sprang away\r\nat a rapid trot.\r\n\r\nThe boys reached the tent about one o’clock, leading the fawn by the two\r\nhandkerchiefs.  They had been strongly tempted more than once to leave\r\nit behind, tied to a bush, or to free it entirely, as it somewhat\r\nretarded their movements; but having already taught it the art of\r\nfollowing, it came after them with rapid strides, and for the latter\r\nhalf of their journey they had not to pull it in the least.  Mary and\r\nFrank heard their distant halloo, and ran to meet them.  They were\r\ndelighted with the new pet, and spent a moment in patting its snowy\r\nsides; but the interest excited by the person across the river absorbed\r\nevery other consideration.  As soon as Harold saw the smoke still\r\nfaintly rising, he said, \"I saw that smoke this morning.  It was so\r\nfaint I could scarcely discern it darken the sky, and took it for mist.\r\nThat person has been there all night.\"\r\n\r\nRobert had by this time adjusted the glass, and each looked in turn.\r\nThey could see nothing more than a little smoke.  Mary described the\r\nposition in which she saw the person lying, and dragging himself along,\r\nafter the guns were fired.  \"Then,\" said Harold, \"I will let off another\r\ngun; and do you, Robert, place yourself so that you can see whether he\r\nnotices it.\"\r\n\r\nRobert laid himself flat on the sand, rested the glass upon a log of\r\nwood, that both he and it might be steady, and said, \"Now fire!\"  About\r\na quarter of a minute after the discharge he exclaimed, \"I see him!  He\r\nis lying upon the sand beneath the shade of a cedar.  I see him move.\r\nHe rests on one arm, as though he were sick or hurt.  Now he drags\r\nhimself as you describe, sister.  There is his flag flying again.  He\r\nuses only one arm.  The other hangs down uselessly by his side.  Who can\r\nit be?  I wish he was in the sunshine, for then I could see his\r\ncomplexion.  But I am sure it is not a white man.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, it is Riley!\" said Frank.  \"I know it is Riley come after us.  Now\r\nwe can go home again.\"\r\n\r\nHarold took the glass and used it as Robert had done. The person had by\r\nthis time put down the flag, and was reclining languidly against some\r\nsupport behind him. Harold saw him grasp his left arm with his right\r\nhand, move it gently, and lie back as before.  \"That person is badly\r\nhurt,\" he remarked.  \"Instead of helping us, he wants us to help him.\r\nIt must be some one who was cast away in the storm last night.  Oh, for\r\nour boat! Robert, we must go over and help him.  We can make a raft.  It\r\nis not three miles across.  We have the oars and paddle of our boat, and\r\nwe can surely make that distance and back this evening, by hard work.\r\nLet us see if there is not timber enough near at hand for a raft.\"\r\n\r\nThey looked at a fallen tree not far distant, and wished it were only\r\nnear the river bank.  \"But what do I say?\" said Robert.  \"The palmetto,\r\nwhich I felled for the cabbage, is sixty or seventy feet long, straight\r\nas an arrow, and what is better, just at the river side.\"\r\n\r\nOff they went with ax, hatchet, and nails.  Mary called after them to\r\nsay, that if they would show her the way, she and Frank would follow\r\nthem with something to eat.\r\n\r\n\"Do, cousin, if you please,\" said Harold.  \"I, for one, am hungry\r\nenough.  We will blaze a path for you as we pass along.  Do follow us\r\nsoon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean that you will chop the trees as you pass?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes.  We will chop them so as to show the white wood beneath the\r\nbark.  That is called a blaze.  You cannot mistake your way.\"\r\n\r\nThe work of blazing the path scarcely detained them at all; an\r\nexperienced woodsman can do it with a single blow of his ax as he moves,\r\nwithout stopping.  Many of the trees were cut so as to show little more\r\nthan the mark of the hatchet.  Coming to the fallen palmetto, the boys\r\ncut it into four lengths, one of twenty, two of seventeen, and the\r\nremainder of ten feet long.  It was easy work; the palmetto is a soft\r\nwood, and every blow of the ax, after going beneath the hard surface,\r\nmade a deep cut.  Then with the aid of levers, they rolled the logs to\r\nthe water’s edge; they pinned them together, sharpened the bow for a\r\ncutwater, and fastened some cross pieces on top for seats, and as\r\nreceptacles for the thowl pins.\r\n\r\nWhile thus engaged, Mary and Frank, guided by the blazed trees, and\r\nattracted by the sound of the ax, came with a basket full of provision,\r\nand setting it before them, remarked, \"I am sorry we have no water yet\r\nto offer you, but here are some of the oranges we brought the other\r\nday.\"\r\n\r\nIt is almost incredible what a deal of work can be accomplished in a\r\nlimited time, where a person works with real vigour and good will.  The\r\nboys were themselves astonished to find that shortly after three o’clock\r\nthey were seated on their raft, with Mary and Frank aboard, rowing\r\nrapidly towards the landing at the tent.  A glance now at the spring\r\nshowed that they could supply themselves with water, and while Harold\r\nscooped out a basin, and dammed it against the occasional overflow of a\r\nwave, Robert went with Mary and Frank to the tent, from which he brought\r\ndown the guns, a jug for water, the spy-glass, and the morocco medicine\r\ncase, of which Mary had told him, and which he supposed might be needed\r\nby the sick person.\r\n\r\nOnce more Robert and Harold embarked, leaving the younger ones on the\r\nshore.  \"Do not be alarmed,\" said they, seeing the tears start into\r\nMary’s eyes at the prospect of another separation.  \"Make a good fire on\r\nshore, and put your trust in God.  We will try to return before dark;\r\nand we hope to bring you good news from home. If the person yonder is a\r\nmessenger from Tampa, we will let you know by firing two guns; look out,\r\nand listen for them about five minutes after you see us land.\"  With a\r\nsilent prayer to God from each party for safety and success, the\r\nvoyagers waved adieu to the others, and were soon moving through the\r\nwater at the rate of more than two miles the hour.\r\n\r\nHowever earnest they were to relieve the person apparently in distress,\r\nthe boys did not approach the opposite shore without caution.  They knew\r\nthemselves to be in the land of savages, who were exceedingly ingenious\r\nand patient in their schemes of violence.  Each took in turn the glass,\r\nwhen relieved by the other in rowing, and directed it upon the point to\r\nwhich they were going. Approaching within a quarter of a mile of shore,\r\nthey rested upon their oars, and deliberately surveyed both the person\r\nand the place.  They could distinctly see him reclining against the\r\ncedar, and beckoning with his right hand.\r\n\r\n\"Harold,\" said Robert, \"that is a negro, and I do believe it is Sam, the\r\ncarpenter.  O poor fellow! how badly hurt he appears to be.  I wonder\r\nwhat can be the matter!\"\r\n\r\nThey pulled along very fast, and when within a hundred yards of shore\r\nstopped and looked again.  \"It is Sam,\" said Robert.  \"All’s right!  Let\r\nus push on now!\"\r\n\r\nRunning the raft ashore, and making it fast to their ax, sunk in the\r\nsand for a stake, they hurried up the bluff.  There indeed lay Sam,\r\nbadly hurt and unable to move.  They ran to him, and were about to throw\r\ntheir arms around him, when he beckoned them off imploringly, and said,\r\n\"Stop! stop! for marcy sake don’t shake me hard.  Huddie[#] Mas Robbut!\r\nHuddie Mas Harrol! Bless de Lord to see you once mo’e!\" the tears\r\nstreaming down the poor fellow’s face.\r\n\r\n\r\n[#] Howdye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Dear old Sam!\" said the boys, \"we are so glad to see you.  But what is\r\nthe matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, I am kill!\" he replied; \"my arm and leg bote got broke las’ night.\r\nYou got any water?\"\r\n\r\n\"Plenty--plenty.  We brought it for you,\" and they both ran for the jug,\r\nbut Harold was foremost, and Robert returned.\r\n\r\n\"Mas Robbut,\" Sam asked, \"wey de children?\"\r\n\r\n\"We left them at the tent yonder.  They were the first to see you; and\r\nthey fired the guns that you heard.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless dey young soul,\" he said, \"I do lub ’em.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how is father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Berry well--berry well--O Lord my leg!--’sept he in mighty trouble\r\n’bout you all.\"\r\n\r\n\"Here is the water, Sam,\" said Harold returning, \"let me hold the jug\r\nwhile you drink.  There, don’t take too much at first--it may hurt you.\r\nHow is uncle?\"\r\n\r\nSam told him.  While they were conversing, Robert ran to the raft,\r\nbrought from it his gun, went to the most conspicuous part of the bluff,\r\nand waving first a white handkerchief, until he received an answering\r\nsignal from Mary and Frank, fired the two barrels at the interval of\r\nseveral seconds.\r\n\r\n\"Please mossa, let me hab some mo’e water?\" Sam asked; then taking a\r\nhearty draught, he said, \"Bless de Lord for dis nice cool water!  It is\r\nso good!\"\r\n\r\nThey inquired of him the nature and occasion of his accident.  \"It was\r\nde boat las’ night--Riley’s boat,\" said he.  \"It kill him and cripple\r\nme.  We come to look for you all.  De win’ blow and de sea rise; and me\r\nand Riley went to draw the boat higher on sho’, w’en a big wave lif’ de\r\nboat and pitch it right into Riley’s breast. It kill him I s’pose--I\r\nnebber see him no mo’e.  W’en I come to my senses, I bin lie right on de\r\nbeach, wi’ my arm and leg broke, and de water dashin’ ober me.  I drag\r\nmyself up here las’ night, by my well arm and leg; but if it hadn’t bin\r\nfor de win’ I nebber bin git here at all--it lif’ me up like a fedder.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is talking enough for this time, Sam,\" said Robert; \"you are too\r\nsick and weak, and we have no time to spare.  Let us carry you to our\r\ntent, and there you may talk as much as you will.  Is there anything we\r\ncan do for you before we move?\"\r\n\r\n\"Only to give me a little mo’e water.\"  He had already drunk a quart.\r\nHe also pointed them to a certain spot, where they found Riley’s rifle\r\nand its equipments, together with an ax and several gourds.  These were\r\ntransferred to the raft; and Harold said, \"Come, Sam, tell us how we can\r\nhelp you.  The sun is fast going down, and we have a long way to go.\r\nMary and Frank don’t wish to be left in the dark, and are no doubt\r\nlooking for us to start.\"\r\n\r\n\"De childun!  Bless ’em!\" said Sam.  \"I do want to see dey sweet face\r\nonce mo ’e.  But I ’fraid it will kill me to move.  See how my arm and\r\nleg swell a’ready.\"\r\n\r\nAfter much demurring, Sam consented to attempt the removal; and though\r\nhe groaned and shuddered at the thought, it was effected with far less\r\npain than he expected.  They spread his blanket beside him, helped him\r\ninto the middle of it, lapped and pinned its edges over a strong pole\r\nwith splinters of cedar, and taking each an end of the pole, lifted him\r\ngently from the ground, and bore him at full length to the raft, where\r\nthey had previously prepared a couch of moss.\r\n\r\nThe sun sunk into the waters ere they had gone half a mile; but the boys\r\npulled with a hearty good will, and moreover with the advantage of a\r\nlittle wind in their favour.  It was dark when they landed, or rather,\r\ndark as it could be with a bright moon nearly at the full. Robert took\r\noccasion while at the helm to re-load his two barrels with powder, and\r\nrepeat the signal agreed upon. As the darkness deepened they could see\r\nafar off the figures of Mary and Frank standing upon the beach, before a\r\nfire which they had made as a guide to the voyagers, and listening\r\napparently to every thump of the oars. Long before words could be\r\ndistinguished, Frank’s clear voice rang over the waters in a tone of\r\ninquiry.  The two boys united their voices at a high musical pitch, and\r\nsung out, \"Sam!  Sam!\" repeating it at intervals until they perceived\r\nfrom the tones of the children on shore that the name had been heard.\r\nPresently Frank’s voice shouted shrilly, \"Howdy, Sam?\"  Poor Sam tried\r\nto answer, but his voice was too weak.  Robert and Harold answered for\r\nhim.  Mary would have called out too; but the truth is she was crying\r\nfor joy, and was not able to utter a word.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nNIGHT LANDING--CARRYING A WOUNDED PERSON--SETTING ONE’S OWN LIMBS WHEN\r\nBROKEN--SPLINTING A LIMB--REST TO THE WEARY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a picturesque scene as the raft drew near shore.  The soft\r\nmoonlight upon the bluff--the faint sparkle of the briny water broken by\r\nthe oars--the lurid light from the resinous fire--the dark shadows and\r\nexcited movements of Mary and Frank--formed altogether a group worthy of\r\na painter’s skill.\r\n\r\nFrank could scarcely be restrained from rushing through the water to\r\nwelcome the new comer; but when he heard how weak he was, and in what\r\nbad condition, he waited in quietness.  Harold took him in his arms, and\r\nRobert made a stepping place for Mary with the oars, and they both shook\r\nhands with the poor fellow, and told him how sorry they were to see him\r\nso badly hurt.\r\n\r\nLeaving Harold and Frank at the raft, Robert and Mary hastened to the\r\ntent to prepare a place for the invalid, that he need not be disturbed\r\nafter being once removed.  They lit a candle, piled the trunks in a\r\ncorner of the room, and taking most of the moss that constituted their\r\nbeds, laid it in another corner, remarking, \"We can easily obtain more;\r\nor we can even sleep on the ground tonight, if necessary, for his sake.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish we had an old door, or even a plank long enough for him to lie\r\nupon, as we bring him from the raft,\" said Robert, \"it would be so much\r\neasier to his broken bones, if they could be kept straight.  But the\r\nblanket is next best, and with that we must be content.\"\r\n\r\nBy the time the transfer was completed, the boys were exceedingly weary,\r\nhaving been disturbed all the preceding night, and engaged in vigorous\r\nand incessant effort ever since they arose from their short sleep.  They\r\nsat for half an hour revelling in the luxury of rest. Sam appeared to\r\nsuffer so much and to be so weak, that they discouraged him from\r\ntalking, and took their own seats outside the tent, that he might be\r\nable to sleep.\r\n\r\n\"What have you done with the fawn, sister?\" inquired Robert, willing to\r\ndivert their minds from the painful thoughts that were beginning to\r\nfollow the excitement of hearing from home.\r\n\r\n\"O, we fed it with sassafras leaves and grass,\" said she, \"and gave it\r\nwater.  After that we sewed the torn skin to its place upon the neck,\r\nand it appears to be doing very well.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are quite a surgeon, cousin Mary,\" Harold remarked.  \"I think we\r\nshall have to call you our ’Sister of Mercy.’  If, however, our\r\nhandkerchiefs are still tied to it, I will suggest that it may be best\r\nfor it, as well as for us, that you make a soft pad for its neck, and\r\nput on the dog’s collar.\"\r\n\r\n\"We have done that already,\" she replied.  \"I thought of it as soon as\r\nwe returned to the tent and saw the dog’s chain.  But as for my being a\r\nsurgeon, it requires very little skill to know that the sooner a fresh\r\nwound is attended to, and the parts brought to the right place for\r\nhealing the better.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a fact,\" said Robert, starting, as a deep groan from the tent\r\nreached his ears; \"and that reminds me that perhaps Sam is suffering at\r\nthis moment for the want of having his bones set.  We must attend to\r\nthem at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Set a broken arm and leg!\" exclaimed Harold in surprise.  \"Why, Robert,\r\ndo you know how to do it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" he replied.  \"There is no mystery about it; and father, you\r\nknow, teaches us children everything of the kind, as soon as we are able\r\nto learn it.  I have never set the bones of a _person_, but I did once\r\nof a dog, and succeeded very well.\"\r\n\r\nHarold asked him to describe the process.  Robert replied, \"If the bones\r\nappear to have moved from their proper place, all that you have to do is\r\nto pull them apart lengthways by main strength so that they will\r\nnaturally slide together, or else can be made to do so by the pressure\r\nof your hand.  Then you must bandage the limb with strips of cloth,\r\nbeginning at its extremity, so as to keep the parts in place; and over\r\nthis you must bind a splint, to keep the bone from being bent or jostled\r\nout of place. That is all.\"\r\n\r\nThey went into the tent, and made inquiry of Sam whether his bones did\r\nnot need attention.  He replied that maybe his leg was in need of\r\nsetting, but that as for his arm he had _sot_ that himself, and that it\r\nwas in need only of splintering.\r\n\r\n\"You set it yourself!  Why, how did you manage that?\" inquired Robert.\r\n\r\n\"You remember, Mas Robbut, I bin hab my arm broke once befo’e; so I\r\nknowed jes what to do,\" replied Sam, and then he went on to describe his\r\nprocess.  He said that finding the bones out of place, he had tied the\r\nhand of his broken arm to a root of the cedar, and strained himself back\r\nuntil the bones were able to pass, when he pressed them into place by\r\nmeans of his well hand.\r\n\r\nAfter that he tore some strips from his clothing, and tied the hand over\r\nhis breast, at the same time stuffing his bosom full of moss, to keep\r\nthe bone straight, and over all passing a bandage, to keep the arm\r\nagainst his side.  He had made a similar attempt to set the bone of his\r\nleg, but it pained him so much that he had given up the attempt.\r\n\r\nOn examination, Robert learned that the arm was broken between the elbow\r\nand shoulder, and that the leg was fractured between the knee and ankle.\r\n\"The leg,\" said he, \"is safe enough.  Below the knee are two bones, and\r\nonly one of these is broken.  Would you like to have the bandage and\r\nsplints put on your arm tonight?\"\r\n\r\nSam replied that he was sure he should sleep better if Mas Robert was\r\nnot too tired to attend to it, for he would be \"mighty onrestless\" while\r\nhis bones were in that \"fix.\"\r\n\r\nThe wearied boy pondered a moment, and asked his sister to tear one of\r\nthe sheets or table-cloths into strips about as wide as her three\r\nfingers, and to sew the ends together, to make a bandage five or six\r\nyards long, while he and Harold prepared the splints.  They then went to\r\nthe palmetto tree, half a mile distant, and selecting one of the\r\nbroadest and straightest of its flat, polished limbs, returned to the\r\ntent, and produced from it a lath about the length of the arm.  Having\r\nbandaged the limb from the finger-ends to the shoulder, they bound it to\r\nthis splint, which extended from the armpit to the extremity, and Robert\r\npronounced the operation complete.\r\n\r\nSam was profuse in his praise of Robert’s surgery, bestowing upon it\r\nevery conceivable term of laudation, and seeming withal to be truly\r\ngrateful.  \"Tankee, Mas Robert!  Tankee, Mas Harold!  Tankee, my dear\r\nlittle misses!  Tankee, Mas Frank too!  Tankee, ebbery body! I sure I\r\nbin die on dat sand-bank, ’sept you all bin so kind to de poor nigger.\"\r\n\r\n\"No more of that, Sam,\" said Robert, \"you were hurt in trying to help\r\nus; it is but right we should help you.\"\r\n\r\nAt the close of this scene, the young people prepared for bed.  It was\r\npast ten o’clock, and they were sadly in need of rest; but so strongly\r\nhad their sympathies been excited for their black friend, that even\r\nlittle Frank kept wide awake, waiting his turn to be useful.  When,\r\nhowever, their work was done, and they had lain down to rest, they\r\nneeded no lullaby to hush them into slumber. Within twenty minutes after\r\nthe light was extinguished, and during the livelong night, nothing was\r\nto be heard in that tent but the hard breathing of the wearied sleepers.\r\nThanks to God for sleep!  None but the weary know its blessedness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SURPRISE AND DISAPPOINTMENT--NAMING THE FAWN--SAM’S\r\nSTORY--DEPRESSION AFTER EXCITEMENT--GREAT MISFORTUNE\r\n\r\n\r\nHad there been nothing to excite them the company might have overslept\r\nthemselves on the following morning.  But shortly after daylight they\r\nwere awaked by an incident that hurried them all out of bed.  It was\r\nnothing less than hearing Frank exclaim, in a laughing, joyous tone, \"O\r\nfather, howdy! howdy!  I am so glad you have come!\"\r\n\r\nThe dull ears of the sleepers were caught by these welcome words, and\r\nall sprang to their feet.\r\n\r\n\"Father!  Father!  Is he here?\" they asked. \"Where, Frank? where!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yonder,\" said he, sitting bolt-upright in bed, rubbing his half-opened\r\neyes with one hand, and with the other pointing to a corner of the tent.\r\n\"Isn’t that father?  I saw him there just now.\"\r\n\r\nIt was only a dream.  Frank had been thinking more than usual of home\r\nduring the day and night past, and it was natural that his visions of\r\nthe night should be of the same character with his dreams of the day.\r\nHe fancied that his father had found the lost boat, and having tied it\r\nat the landing, was coming to the tent. Poor fellow! he was sadly\r\ndisappointed to learn that it was all a dream.  The picture was so\r\nvivid, and his father looked so real, that for a moment he was perfectly\r\nconfused.  Mary tried to comfort him by saying, \"Never mind, buddy; we\r\n_will_ see him coming some of these days.  But though father is not\r\nhere, you remember that Sam is, and that he is going to tell us about\r\nhome, as soon as he is able to talk.  Come, let us get up, and see how\r\nhe is.\"  The history of the preceding day dawned slowly upon the mind of\r\nthe bewildered child, and the sense of disappointment was gradually lost\r\nin the hope of hearing Sam’s story.\r\n\r\nThe wounded man had spent a night of suffering. His leg pained him so\r\nintensely, that several times he had been on the point of calling for\r\nassistance; but hearing from every one that peculiar breathing which\r\nbetokens deep sleep, and remembering that they had undergone immense\r\nfatigue, he stifled his groans, and bore his sufferings in silence.\r\n\r\nWhile Robert and Harold were occupied with kind offices around the\r\ncouch, Mary and Frank went to see after the fawn.  Its neck was somewhat\r\nsore to the touch, but otherwise it appeared to be doing well.  They\r\ngave it more water, hay and sassafras leaves.  Frank offered it also a\r\npiece of bread; but wild deer are not used to cookery, and the fawn\r\nrejected it; though, after becoming thoroughly tamed, it became so fond\r\nof bread of every kind, that it would follow Frank all over the woods\r\nfor a piece no bigger than his finger.  \"What shall we call her?\" asked\r\nFrank.\r\n\r\n\"We will have a consultation about that,\" replied Mary, as she saw the\r\nothers approaching.  \"Cousin Harold, what name would you give?\"\r\n\r\n\"Snow or Lily, I think, would suit her colour very well,\" he answered.\r\n\r\n\"Brother Robert, what is yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"As she came from among the flowers,\" he said, \"I think Flora would do\r\nvery well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" added Mary, \"and very pretty names all Frank, what is yours?\"\r\n\r\n\"Anna,\" said he, \"I would like to talk to her sometimes, and to make\r\nbelieve that she was Sister Anna.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would sound almost too much like Nannie,\" Mary objected, and then\r\nasked, \"Did you say, brother, that you gave her to me?\"  He replied,\r\n\"Yes.\" \"Then,\" she added, \"I will call her Dora, for I heard father say\r\nthat that name means a gift.\"\r\n\r\n\"Dora let it be,\" said Robert, patting its delicate head.  \"Miss Dora, I\r\nwish you a speedy cure, and a pleasant captivity.\"\r\n\r\nAbout nine o’clock Sam awakened from a refreshing sleep, and the anxious\r\ncompany assembled at his side to hear what he had to tell about home.\r\n\"I a’nt got much to tell,\" said Sam, \"I lef so soon a’ter you all, dat\r\nyou know most all sept what happen to me and Riley on de way.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us hear it all,\" said Robert.\r\n\r\n\"But before you begin,\" interrupted Mary, \"do tell us about William.\r\nWas he drowned or not?\"\r\n\r\n(For the sake of the reader who may not be familiar with the lingo of\r\nsouthern and sea-coast negroes, the narrative will be given in somewhat\r\nbetter English, retaining, however, the peculiarities of thought and\r\ndrapery.)\r\n\r\n\"O, no, Misses,\" he replied to Mary’s question.  \"He only fell backward\r\ninto the water, and was a little strangled.  He rose directly, and gave\r\nthe alarm.  I suppose the reason that you did not hear him was that he\r\nwas under the wharf, holding tight to a post, for fear some of the fish\r\nmight come and take hold of him too.  He came with me to Riley’s\r\nIsland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now do you begin at the beginning,\" said Robert, \"and tell us one thing\r\nafter another, just as it happened. If there is anything of which we\r\nwish to hear more particularly, we will stop you to inquire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Sam, \"you know that when you left I was working in the back\r\nroom.  I was putting in the window sash, when I heard your father\r\ntalking to some one at the door, and saying, ’Stay here, I will be out\r\nin a moment!’  He went into his room, came out with something in his\r\nhand, and spoke a word to the man at the door, when we heard William’s\r\nvoice, crying out, ’Help! help!’ as if he was half smothered.  Your\r\nfather said, ’What can be the matter?’  I heard him and the stranger\r\nrunning towards the bluff, and I ran too.  When I reached a place where\r\nI could see you (for the little cedars were between the house and the\r\nwater), your father had just fallen upon his knees. He had his two hands\r\njoined together, and was praying very hard; he was pale as a sheet, and\r\ngroaned as if his heart was breaking.  For a while I could hardly take\r\nmy eyes off from him; but I could see you in the boat, going over the\r\nwater like a dove through the air, leaving a white streak of foam\r\nbehind.  Presently your father rose from his knees, and said, ’It is a\r\ndevil fish! He cannot hold that gait long.  Sam, do you and William (for\r\nWilliam had by this time come up from the water), get the canoe ready in\r\na minute, and let us pursue them;’ then he wrung his hands again, and\r\nsaid, ’O, my God, have mercy, and spare my children!’\r\n\r\n\"William and I ran a few steps toward the canoe, but I came back to tell\r\nmaster that the canoe could not float--a piece of timber had fallen from\r\nthe wharf, and punched a great hole in it.  Then the soldier spoke, and\r\nsaid, ’The Major has a fine sail boat, Doctor.  If you can do no better,\r\nI will ride very fast, and ask him to send it.’  ’Do, if you please,’\r\nmaster said.  ’Tell the Major he is my only help on earth.  Lay your\r\nhorse to the ground, good soldier, I will pay all damages.’  The soldier\r\nturned short off, clapped his spurs to his horse, and made him lay\r\nhimself almost straight to the ground.\r\n\r\n\"When your father came to the canoe, he said quickly, ’We can mend that\r\nhole, and set off long before the boat comes from Tampa.  Peter, make a\r\nfire here at once--quick! quick!  Judy, run to the house, and bring down\r\na pot, and the cake of wax, and a double handful of oakum.  William, do\r\nyou go to the house too, and bring the side of harness leather, two\r\nhammers, and a paper of the largest tacks.  And Sam,’ said he to me,\r\n’let us take hold of the boat, and turn it over ready for mending.’  The\r\nhole was big as my head, and there were two long cracks besides; but we\r\nworked very fast, and the boat was ready for the water in less than an\r\nhour.  Your father worked as hard as any of us, but every once in a\r\nwhile he turned to watch you, and looked very sorrowful.  At last you\r\nwent so far away that we could barely see you, like a little speck,\r\ngetting smaller and smaller.  When you were entirely out of our sight,\r\nyour father took his other spy glass, went on top of the shed, and\r\nwatched you till we were ready to go.  Then he came to us, and said to\r\nme and William, ’I have concluded to send you off alone; you can row\r\nfaster without me.  I will wait for the Major’s boat. The children are\r\nnow passing Riley’s Island, and turning down the coast.  Make haste to\r\nRiley, and say from me, that if he brings me back my children I will\r\ngive him whatever he asks.  If he needs either of you, do you, Sam, go\r\nwith him, and do you, William, return to me; otherwise do you both keep\r\non so far as you can with safety, and if you succeed, I will give you\r\nalso whatever you ask.  If you can hear anything of them from Riley,\r\nmake a smoke on the beach; if you learn anything good make two smokes,\r\nabout a hundred yards apart; I will watch for them.  And now, my good\r\nfellows, good-bye! and may the Lord give you a safe passage and good\r\nsuccess!’  Neither I nor William could say one word.  We took hold of\r\nmaster’s hands, knelt down, and kissed them.  And, somehow, I saw his\r\nhand was very wet; we could not help it, for we love him the same as if\r\nhe was our father, and the tears would come.\r\n\r\n\"We reached the island about twelve o’clock.  Riley was gone.  His wife\r\nsaid he saw the boat pass, knew who was in it, and went after it,\r\nwithout stopping for more than a calabash of water.  When we heard that,\r\nwe jumped into our own boat again, and pushed on. Riley’s wife brought\r\ndown a bag of parched corn, a dried venison ham, and his gun and\r\nammunition, saying that if he went he would need these things.  We\r\nbegged her to make two fires on the beach; for we thought that although\r\nit was not the best news in the world to hear that you had been carried\r\nso far away, it was good news to hear that you had not been drowned, and\r\nthat Riley had gone after you.\r\n\r\n\"In about an hour we met Riley coming back.  He had gone to a high\r\nbluff, on an island south of his, and watched you until you had passed\r\nout of sight. He was now returning home, uncertain whether to go after\r\nyou in the morning, or to give you up altogether. When we gave him your\r\nfather’s message, he said he would go, for that the Doctor was a good\r\nman, but that he must return home for a larger boat; that the coast\r\nbelow was dangerous, and that the boat in which he was was not safe.  So\r\nwe came to his island, where I staid with him that night, and William\r\nreturned to Bellevue.\r\n\r\n\"As we left the island at daybreak we saw a vessel sailing towards\r\nTampa, but too far for us to hail.  That day we did not search the coast\r\nat all, more than to keep a sharp look out, for we knew that you had\r\ngone far beyond.  But the next three days we went into every cove and\r\ninlet, though not very far into any of them. Riley said that since the\r\nchange of Indian Agents, many of his people were hostile to the whites,\r\nand to all Indians who were friendly with them, and that perhaps he\r\nshould not be safe.\r\n\r\n\"We saw some Indians on the first few days, but the last day we saw none\r\nat all.  Riley said that this coast was barren and bad; nobody visited\r\nit.  The Caloosa Indians, he said, used to live here, but they had been\r\nstarved out.  There was only a narrow strip of ten miles wide, between\r\nthe sea and the swamps within, and a great fire had swept over it a few\r\nsummers before, and burnt up almost all the trees.  The Indians supposed\r\nthat this part of the coast was cursed by the Great Spirit.\r\n\r\n\"All that day we found the coast so full of reefs and shoals, and\r\ncovered with breakers, that we could scarcely get along; and we talked\r\nseveral times of turning back. These breakers that you see from the\r\nbluff, stretch from a great ways above.  Riley did not like to pass\r\nthem.  He said he was afraid we could not stop anywhere, except on an\r\nisland, which no Indian dared to visit; for that it was always enchanted\r\nwith _white deer_,[#] and the curse of the Great Spirit was so strong\r\nupon it that no Indian could go there and live.\r\n\r\n\r\n[#] It is surprising to learn how widespread is the superstition among\r\nsemi-civilized and uncivilized nations that white deer are connected\r\nwith enchantment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"We kept on, however, as well as we could, and hoped to find some place\r\nwhere we could pass the surf upon the shoals, and reach the shore,\r\nbefore we came to that terrible island.  But the wind was against us,\r\nand also blowing on shore; and we made so little headway, that towards\r\nevening we had to force our way through the smoothest place we could\r\nfind, and even then were nearly swamped more than once.  When we landed\r\nit was dark. We saw a fire afar off, and thinking it might be yours, I\r\ntried to persuade Riley to go to it; but perhaps he thought it was on\r\n_that island_, though he did not say so; he replied only that we were\r\ngoing to have a storm soon, and that we must be preparing for it.  We\r\ndrew the boat as high on the beach as possible, and made it fast by his\r\npainter, made of twisted deerskins.\r\n\r\n\"After we landed I cut some wood, and tried to make a fire; but before\r\nwe could set it a-blazing the wind came and the tide rose.  We went to\r\nthe boat, and drew it up higher on shore, and then higher still; but\r\nafter a while the wind blew so hard, and the waves rolled so high, that\r\nit was not safe to be near the boat at all.  Yet we could not afford to\r\nlose it; so we went down for the last time to draw it up, when all at\r\nonce a big wave came and pitched it upon us as I told you.\r\n\r\n\"I had a terrible night.  The water from the beach dashed over me while\r\nlying under the cedar tree to which I had crawled, and the rain poured\r\ndown.  The wind kept such a roaring that I suppose if a cannon had been\r\nfired a mile off you could not have heard it.\r\n\r\n\"The next morning I tried to set my broken bones. Then I dragged myself\r\nto the edge of the bluff to see if Riley’s body, or the boat, or\r\nanything was in sight.  But nothing was to be seen except the black\r\nwater rolling in from sea.  As the light became stronger, I saw afar off\r\nyour tent and smoke, and I was then sure that the fire we saw the night\r\nbefore was yours.  I tried every way to make you see me.  I took Riley’s\r\nrifle, and snapped it, but the powder inside was wet.  Then I went to a\r\nbush, and with my one hand cut a long switch, to which I tied my\r\nhandkerchief, and waved and waved it; but nobody saw me.  I could see\r\n_you_ very well (for my sight is good) sitting down, or walking about,\r\nas if you were in trouble about something.  Then I tried to raise a\r\nsmoke.  Everything was wet; but the tree near me had a hollow, and in\r\nthe hollow was some dry rotten wood.  I spread some powder on the driest\r\npieces, and by snapping the rifle over it several times, set it on fire;\r\nbut it was a long time before I could find anything to burn well.  While\r\nI was trying at the fire, you, Mas Robbut and Mas Harrol, went off; but\r\nI kept on throwing into the fire whatever trash and small wood I could\r\ncollect by crawling after them, until I was sure Miss Mary and Mas Frank\r\nwould see it.  At last I heard their guns, and knew by their motions\r\nthat they saw me; and for a time I felt safe.  But you were so long time\r\naway, and I was in such pain, that it seemed to me I must die before you\r\ncould help me, though I saw you come to the tent, and heard your guns.\r\nAnd when, late in the evening, I saw that you had got a boat, or\r\nsomething of that sort, and were coming over the river to me, I was so\r\nglad that I--I--\"\r\n\r\nSam did not finish the sentence.  The tears were streaming down his\r\nblack face, and the young people were weeping with him.  There were but\r\nfew questions to be asked.  Sam’s narrative had been so full and\r\nparticular, that it anticipated almost every inquiry.\r\n\r\nThe severe labours of the day before, together with excitement and loss\r\nof rest, had so far relaxed the energies of the larger boys, that they\r\ndid little more that day than hang about the tent, and converse with Sam\r\nand each other about home and their own adventures. Several times Harold\r\nproposed to Robert to join him in visiting the beach, to ascertain\r\nwhether their signal had stood the storm, and if not, to replant it; but\r\nRobert ever had some reason ready for not going just then.  At last,\r\nlate in the afternoon, they took the spade and hoe, and went to the\r\nbeach.  The flag was prostrate, and lay half buried in the sand; and\r\nwhat was their dismay, on approaching the bluff, to see a vessel that\r\nhad evidently passed the mouth of the river just beyond the shoals, and\r\nwas now about four miles distant, sailing to the southward.\r\n\r\n\"O, cousin!\" exclaimed Robert, \"there is our vessel--gone!  It is the\r\ncutter!  Father is aboard of her! They came as near as they could,\r\nlooking for our signal--and there it lies!  Oh--h!\" said he, wringing\r\nhis hands, \"why did we not come sooner?\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe you are correct,\" replied Harold, looking sadly after the\r\ndeparting vessel; \"we have missed our chance.\"\r\n\r\nThere remained one solitary hope.  It was possible, barely possible,\r\nthat some one on board might be looking that way with a spy-glass, and\r\nthat the signal might yet be seen.  The boys eagerly seized the\r\nflag-staff; they set the lower end upon the ground; they waved it to and\r\nfro in the air; they shook their handkerchiefs; they tossed up their\r\nhats and coats, and shouted with all their might (vain shout!), \"Brig\r\nahoy!\"  They gathered grass, leaves, twigs, everything inflammable, and\r\nraised a smoke, as large as possible, and kept it rising, higher,\r\nhigher.  They were too late; the vessel kept steadily on her way.  She\r\nfaded gradually from sight, and disappeared for ever.\r\n\r\nThe two boys sat down, and looked sorrowfully over the distant waters.\r\nThey were pale with excitement, and for a long time neither said a word.\r\n\r\n\"They may return,\" said Harold; \"let us plant our flag-staff.\"\r\n\r\nThey dug a deep hole, set the pole in the middle, threw in the dirt,\r\npacked it tightly with the handle of the hoe, and then returned slowly\r\nto the tent, to inform the others of their sad misfortune.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECULATIONS AND RESOLVES--FISHING--INVENTORY OF GOODS AND\r\nCHATTELS--ROASTED FISH--PALMETTO CABBAGE--TOUR--SEA-SHELLS, THEIR\r\nUSES--THE PELICAN--NATURE OF THE COUNTRY--STILL HUNTING--WILD TURKEYS\r\nAGAIN--WORK ON THE TENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little company did not retire early that night.  Sorrow kept them\r\nawake.  They sat for a long time speculating upon the probable\r\ndestination of the vessel, and upon their own expectations in the case.\r\nTo one it seemed probable that their father had obtained the use of the\r\ncutter, for the purpose of examining the coast; to another, that he had\r\nbeen brought by it to the place where they had last been seen, and that\r\nhe was now not far away; to another, that he would go down as far as the\r\nFlorida Keys, and there employ some of the wreckers to join him in the\r\nsearch. At any rate they were sure that a search was going on, and that\r\nit would not be long before they were discovered, and taken home.\r\n\r\nEre retiring to rest that night they adopted a series of resolutions,\r\nthe substance of which was that they should live every day in the\r\nexpectation of being taken off, and yet husband their resources, as\r\nthough they were to continue there for months.\r\n\r\n1st.  They were to keep their signal always flying.\r\n\r\n2d.  To be as much as possible on the lookout.\r\n\r\n3d.  To have a pile of wood ready for a smoke near the signal.\r\n\r\n4th.  To keep on hand a store of provisions sufficient for several\r\nweeks.\r\n\r\n5th.  To examine, and know exactly what stores they possessed.\r\n\r\n6th.  To use no more of their permanent stock than was absolutely\r\nnecessary, but to live upon the resources of the island.\r\n\r\n7th.  To fit up their habitation more securely, that in case of being\r\nassailed by such another storm as that of Sunday night, they should\r\nenjoy a more perfect protection.\r\n\r\n8th.  In every possible way to be ready either for departing home, or\r\ncontinuing there an indefinite length of time.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these resolutions, the first business to which they\r\nattended on the following morning, was the preparation of the pile of\r\nwood for their signal by smoke; and the next, the provision of a stock\r\nof food. As a temporary fulfilment of this last named duty, Harold went\r\nwith Frank to obtain a supply of fish, leaving Robert and Mary at the\r\ntent, to make out the proposed inventory of goods.  Both parties\r\nfulfilled their contracts, and on coming together, Harold reported eight\r\nlarge trout, besides a number of crabs, and a small turtle; and Robert\r\nread a list, showing that besides the stores put up by their father for\r\nRiley, and those brought by Sam and Riley in their boat, consisting of\r\nbread and bacon, parched corn and dried venison, there were rations for\r\na full fortnight or more.\r\n\r\nOf the trout brought by Harold, all except one had been cleaned, and\r\npresented to Mary; the last he reserved for the purpose, he said, of\r\ngiving them another specimen of wild-woods’ cookery.  Before sitting\r\ndown to dinner, he took this one without any preparation whatever of\r\nscaling or cleansing, and wrapping it in green leaves, laid it in the\r\nashes to roast.  It was soon done.  Then peeling off the skin, he helped\r\neach to the pure white meat in such a way as to leave the skeleton and\r\nits contents untouched.  Mary’s taste was offended by the sight of a\r\ndish so rudely prepared; but hearing the others speak in surprise of its\r\npeculiarly delicate flavour, she also was tempted to try, and then\r\npartook of it as heartily as any one else.\r\n\r\nWhile Harold was absent on his fishing excursion, Robert, having\r\ncompleted his inventory, had obtained another stick of palmetto cabbage.\r\nBy Sam’s instruction, this was freed from every particle of the green\r\nand hard covering, boiled in three separate waters, in the last of which\r\nwas put a little salt.  When thoroughly done, it was laid in a dish, and\r\nseasoned with butter. Prepared thus it was a real delicacy, partaking of\r\nthe combined flavours of the cauliflower and the artichoke.\r\n\r\nBent resolutely upon living as real \"marooners\" on the productions of\r\nthe island, the boys felt that it was necessary for them first to know\r\nsomething more of the country around.  It was therefore agreed that they\r\nshould devote that day to a combined tour of hunting and exploration.\r\nTo this Mary also consented, for she had now become more accustomed to\r\nher situation, and moreover had Sam with her as an adviser.\r\n\r\nTaking an early breakfast, and calling Mum, they departed, leaving\r\nFidelle as a protector to Mary and Frank.  The course which they pursued\r\nwas along the coast.  For a mile they walked on the smooth hard beach,\r\nand saw it covered with innumerable shells, of all sorts and sizes.\r\nSome were most beautifully fluted; others were encircled with spurs or\r\nsharp knots; some were tinted with an exquisite rose colour; others were\r\nsnowy white, and others of a dark mahogany.  Conchs of a large size were\r\nabundant, and there were myriads of little rice-shells.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder if these shells can be put to no use?\" asked Harold.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" Robert responded.  \"If we need lime we can obtain it by\r\nburning them.  These large round shells may be cut so as to make\r\nhandsome cups and vases.  The long ones are used by many poor people for\r\nspoons.  And the conch makes a capital trumpet; our negroes on the\r\nseaboard make a hole in the small end for this purpose.  We often hear\r\nthe boatmen blowing their conchs at night; and when the sound comes to\r\nus across the water, as an accompaniment to their boat songs, it is\r\nparticularly sweet.\"\r\n\r\nOn learning these uses of the conch shell, Harold selected several fine\r\nspecimens, and threw them higher on the beach, remarking, that in case\r\nthey remained upon the island they would need other signals than those\r\nof the gun or the smoke for calling each other’s attention; and that he\r\nintended to try his skill in converting some of these shells into\r\ntrumpets.\r\n\r\nPocketing some of the most delicate varieties for Mary and Frank, they\r\ncontinued down the coast, attracted by a large white object near the\r\nwater-side.  At first it appeared to be a great heap of foam thrown\r\nthere by the sea, but soon they saw it move, and Robert pronounced it to\r\nbe a pelican.  \"It is a pity that it is not eatable,\" said he, \"for one\r\nbird would furnish more flesh than a larger gobbler.  But it is fishy.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, if that be its only fault we can correct it,\" replied Harold.  \"I\r\nrecollect one day when you were sea-sick, hearing the captain say that\r\nhe had eaten every sea-bird that flies, except Mother Cary’s chickens;\r\nand that he took off the skin as you would that of a deer or rabbit, and\r\nsoaked the flesh in strong brine; or if he was on shore he buried it for\r\na day or two in the earth, and that then the flesh was pleasant enough.\r\nHe said, moreover, that the fishy taste of water-fowl comes mostly from\r\nthe skin.  Come, let us get that fellow.  I cannot help thinking what a\r\nnice shawl, in cold or rainy weather, his skin would make for Mary, if\r\nproperly cured with all its feathers on.\"\r\n\r\nThe pelican, however, saved them all future trouble on account of either\r\nits flesh or its skin, for, being a very shy bird, it flew away long\r\nbefore they came within gunshot.  Having ascended the bluff, they stood\r\nupon a bank of sand, and looking far down the coast saw it curve out of\r\nsight, without offering any inducement to pursue it further.\r\nImmediately upon the bluff, and for a quarter of a mile inland, the\r\ncountry was bare of trees, except here and there a cluster of dwarfish\r\ncedars, overtopped by tall palmettoes; but in the interior the forest\r\ntrees appeared rising into loftier magnificence the farther they grew\r\nfrom the sea. Striking across this barren strip--which, however, was\r\npleasantly varied by patches of cacti loaded with superb crimson pears,\r\nand by little wildernesses of chincopin (dwarf-chestnut) bushes, whose\r\nopen burrs revealed each a shining jet black cone--and entering the kind\r\nof forest where game might be expected, Harold gave Mum the order to\r\n\"Hie on\"; and he was soon dashing about in every direction.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose,\" said Robert, \"that you intend to _still hunt_.  But if so,\r\nyou must remember that I have the art yet to learn; and if you wish not\r\nto be interrupted by my blunders, you had better describe now, before we\r\ngo to work, how it is that still hunters find their game, and then how\r\nthey approach it.\"\r\n\r\n\"They find their game by various means,\" Harold replied, acknowledging,\r\nat the same time, the justice of Robert’s remarks.  \"Some by their own\r\nkeen eyes alone in watching or in tracking; others by a dog trained for\r\nthe purpose, as we expect to do.  This last is the easier if the dog is\r\ngood.  When Mum has discovered a trail, he will keep directly before us,\r\nand as the trail freshens he will grow more cautious, until at last his\r\nstep becomes as stealthy and noiseless as a cat.  We must then be\r\ncautious too.  If the woods are close so that we cannot see the deer,\r\nnor they see us until we are upon them, our success will depend upon the\r\nquickness of our shots, and the certainty of our aim; but if the woods\r\nare open, so that we can see them afar off, we must use the cover of a\r\nhill or of a thicket to conceal our approach, or else one of us must\r\nleave the dog with the other, and advance upon them in the open woods.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you do not mean to say,\" Robert argued, in surprise, \"that deer\r\nwill allow you to come upon them in broad day-light, and shoot them\r\ndown?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do,\" he replied; \"and it is easy enough if you will pursue the\r\nright plan.  When a deer feeds, he directs his eyes to the ground; and\r\nduring that time he sees nothing except what is just at his nose. That\r\nis the opportunity you must take to advance.  The moment he lifts his\r\nhead you must stand stock still; and if you can manage to be of the\r\ncolour of a stump, he will be apt to take you for one.\"\r\n\r\n\"But can you stop soon enough to imitate a stump!\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course you must be quick; but this brings me to speak of another\r\nfact.  A deer never puts down nor raises his head without first shaking\r\nhis tail.  Keep your eye therefore steadily fixed upon him, and guide\r\nyour motions by his signs.  Old Torgah used to give me an amusing\r\naccount of the difference between deer and turkeys in this respect; for,\r\nwith all their sagacity, in some things deer are very simple, while the\r\nturkey is so keen and watchful as to be called by hunters ’the wit of\r\nthe woods.’  Old Torgah’s account, given in his broken English is this:\r\n’’Ingin,’ said he, ’see deer feed, and creep on him when his head down.\r\nDeer shake ’ee tail; Injin stop still.  Deer look hard at him, and say\r\n\"stump! stump! nothing but stump!\"  Presently Injin creep close, and\r\nshoot him down.  But Injin see turkey feed, and creep on him.  Turkey\r\nraise ’ee long neck to look, and Injin stand still like a stump; but\r\nturkey never say \"stump!\" once; he say, \"dat old Injin now!\" and he\r\ngone.’  But see, Mum has struck the trail of something.  Notice how\r\neager he is, yet how patiently he waits for us.  Come, let us follow.\"\r\n\r\nIn Robert’s opinion, Mum’s reputation for patience was, on the present\r\noccasion, not deserved; for his pace was so rapid that it was difficult\r\nfor them to keep within sight, and moreover he soon sprang ahead, and\r\nburst into a full loud cry.  \"I thought you said that he hunted in\r\nsilence,\" he remarked, almost out of breath with running.\r\n\r\n\"I said he was silent on the trail of _deer_,\" replied Harold, \"but\r\nthese are turkeys.  Do you not see the deep print of their toes in\r\nrunning!  Mum knows what he is about.  His racing after them will cause\r\nthem to fly into the trees; and then as he stands below and barks, they\r\nwill keep their eyes fixed on him, and never notice us.  There they are!\r\nSee in that oak!  Robert, do you advance behind the cover of yonder\r\nmossy tree. I will find some other place.  But as my rifle will carry\r\nfarther than your smooth bore, do not mind me, except to await my\r\nsignal.  As soon as you are ready to fire, let me know by a whistle; if\r\nI am ready, I will answer you; and then do you fire about a second after\r\nyou hear me.  I will take the highest turkey.\"\r\n\r\nThey advanced silently but rapidly.  Each came within a fair distance.\r\nMum kept up a furious barking as the hunters approached.  One whistle\r\nwas heard, then another; three reports followed in quick succession; and\r\nfour turkeys, two of them magnificent gobblers, tumbled heavily from the\r\ntree.\r\n\r\n\"Well done for us!  Hurra!\" shouted the boys, rushing upon their prey.\r\n\r\nIt was indeed good shooting, although part of it was accidental.  Robert\r\nfairly won the credit of his two shots, having brought down the birds he\r\naimed at; but the ball from Harold’s rifle had passed through the eye of\r\nthe one which he had selected, and broken the legs of another unseen by\r\nhim beyond, and it now lay floundering upon the ground unhurt, except in\r\nits fractured limbs, but unable to rise.\r\n\r\nThe young hunters swung their prizes over a pole, of which each took an\r\nend, and then turned their faces homewards.  The distance was not more\r\nthan two miles, but burdened as they were with guns and game, and\r\ncompelled to cut their way through frequent network of the grape-vine\r\nand yellow jessamine, and dense masses of undergrowth, they were nearly\r\ntwo hours in making it.  Frank spied them from afar, and giving Mary a\r\ncall, bounded to meet them.  \"Whew!\" he whistled, on seeing their load,\r\n\"what a bundle of turkeys!\"  He offered to help them carry a part of the\r\nload, but they were too weary to stop and untie.  They preferred that\r\nMary and Frank should show their kindness, by providing them with some\r\ncool water.  \"We will pay you for your trouble,\" said they, patting\r\ntheir pockets, which were stuffed full of something heavy; \"make haste,\r\nand let us have it.\"\r\n\r\nBy the time they had wiped their wet brows, and begun to enjoy their\r\nrest, the water came.  The boys first emptied their pockets of the\r\nshells and chincopins, found during their ramble, then cooled themselves\r\nby bathing their wrists; after which they drank, and casting themselves\r\nat length upon their couches of moss, they talked across the tent to\r\nSam, who seemed to be as much elated as any of them with their success.\r\n\r\nIt was now past the middle of the day.  The afternoon was spent in\r\nworking upon their tent.  Their object was to make it more impervious to\r\nrain and drift, in case of another storm; and this they effected by\r\nraising the floor, and by spreading the sail of their boat as a sort of\r\nouter awning.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nRAINY DAY--THE KITCHEN AND FIRE--HUNTING THE OPOSSUM\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate for the young adventurers that they had executed so\r\npromptly their intended work upon the tent, for though they had no heavy\r\nwind, the rain poured down during the whole night; and when they arose\r\nnext morning, the sky was full of low scudding clouds, which promised\r\nplenty of rain for all that day, and perhaps for days to come.  But,\r\nthough the tent was dry as a hay loft, there were several deficiencies.\r\nThey had but a meagre supply of wood, and their kitchen fire was without\r\na shelter.  The wind and rain were both chilly; and, it was plain, that\r\nwithout somebody’s getting wet they must content themselves with a cold\r\nbreakfast, and a shivering day.\r\n\r\n\"Why did we not think of this before?\" Robert querulously asked.\r\n\r\n\"Simply because we had other things to think of,\" replied Harold.  \"For\r\nmy part, I am thankful that we have a dry tent.\"\r\n\r\n\"So am I,\" rejoined Robert, changing his tone.  \"But I should be still\r\nmore thankful if we had a place where we could sit by the fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely, _now_ since we know from experience, how uncomfortable it\r\nis to be without.  But I doubt if any of us would be half so thankful,\r\nwere it not for being put to inconvenience.  I recollect a case in\r\npoint. My mother was once taken sick while we were travelling through\r\nthe Indian nation.  At that time the Indians were becoming hostile, and\r\nwe were every day expecting them to declare war.  O, how troubled we all\r\nwere! I remember that every morning we made it a point to say how\r\nthankful we were for spending another night, without being scalped.  But\r\nafterwards, when we had returned home, and could spend our days and\r\nnights in peace, we forgot to be thankful at all.\"\r\n\r\nRobert smiled at the naturalness of the description, and remarked,\r\n\"Well, I think we shall be thankful now for a fire and shelter.  Can we\r\nnot devise some way to have them?\"\r\n\r\nThe result of this conference was, that in the course of an hour they\r\nset up the boat-awning as a sort of kitchen, enclosed on three sides by\r\nthe remaining bed-sheets, and having a fire at the windward gable, near\r\nwhich they sat very cosily on boxes and trunks brought from the tent.\r\n\r\nContrary to their expectation, the rain began to abate about noon, and\r\nlong before sunset the surface of the earth was so much dried, and the\r\ndrops left upon the trees and bushes so thoroughly exhaled or shaken off\r\nby a brisk wind, that the boys used the opportunity to bring in a supply\r\nof wood and lightwood.  The light-wood was very rich, and split into\r\nsuch beautiful torch pieces, that Harold was tempted to think of a kind\r\nof sport in which he had often engaged, and in which he was very fond.\r\n\"We have been pent up all day,\" said he to Robert; \"suppose we change\r\nthe scene by taking a fire-hunt tonight.\"\r\n\r\n\"With all my heart,\" was the reply; \"and I think no one will object to\r\nour having a fat roast pig for our Sunday’s dinner.\"\r\n\r\n\"Probably not,\" Harold rejoined, \"and I am still more in favour of the\r\nidea, for the reason that, as we take such game alive, we can keep it as\r\nlong as we will.\"\r\n\r\nTheir preparation for the excursion consisted simply in splitting an\r\narmful of lightwood, which Harold tied into a bundle, to be readily\r\nslung over the shoulders by a strap.  In the midst of their preparations\r\nFrank came up, and on learning their purpose, almost shouted for joy.\r\nHe had so often heard Sam and William speak of the pleasure of their\r\n’possum hunts, that it had long been the height of his ambition, as a\r\nsportsman, to engage in one; but for various reasons the convenient time\r\nhad never yet come.\r\n\r\n\"O, I am so glad!\" he exclaimed, with a face lighted with pleasure; \"you\r\nwill let me go, won’t you?\"\r\n\r\nHere now was a dilemma.  How could they refuse him? and yet how could\r\nthey with propriety leave Mary with no other companion than poor\r\nbed-ridden Sam? The boys saw no alternative but to give up the hunt,\r\nuntil Robert proposed himself to stay with Mary, on condition that Frank\r\nshould carry the torch and light-wood, while Harold bore the ax and gun.\r\nBut to their gratification, Frank, perceiving the difficulties of the\r\ncase, and ashamed to rob his brother of a place which he himself was\r\nincompetent to fill, set the matter at rest, by saying:\r\n\r\n\"No, brother, I will not go tonight; I will wait and go with Cousin\r\nHarold some time when Sam gets well. But you must give me the pigs when\r\nyou come back, and let me feed them every day.\"\r\n\r\nThey praised him sincerely for his act of self-denial, and promised that\r\nhe should be no loser on account of it.  Soon as it was dark they bid\r\nhim good-night, and departed.  He stood in the tent door, happy in the\r\nthought of their pleasure, and watched the animated motions of boys and\r\ndogs, as the red light flashed upon the trees, and the whole party\r\nbecame gradually lost from sight in the forest.\r\n\r\nThe boys had not proceeded a half mile, before the quick sharp bark,\r\nfirst of Mum, then of Fidelle, gave indications of their having \"treed\"\r\nsome kind of game. Hastening to the spot, they saw the dogs looking\r\neagerly up a slender, tall persimmon, and barking incessantly. For a\r\ntime they could discover nothing in its branches, or on its body; and\r\nhad begun almost to conclude that (in hunter’s phrase) their dogs had\r\n_lied_, when Harold took the torch, waved it to and fro behind him,\r\nwalking thus around the tree, and keeping his eyes fixed on those places\r\nwhere he supposed the opossum to be. Presently he cried out, \"We have\r\nhim!  I see his eyes! Mum, poor fellow,\" patting his head, \"you never\r\nlie, do you?\"  Mum wagged his expressive tail with great emphasis, as\r\nmuch as to say that he perfectly understood both the slander and the\r\nrecantation, and that he now desired nothing but the privilege of giving\r\nthat ’possum a good shake.  Robert also took the light, and holding it\r\nbehind him, saw amid a bunch of moss two small eyes glistening in the\r\ndark.  The aim was so fair that the gun might have been used with\r\ncertainty, were it not against all hunting rule; an opossum must be\r\n_caught_, not killed.  The boys plied their ax upon the yielding wood,\r\nthe eyes of the now silent dogs being fixed alternately upon the game\r\nabove and the work below.  The tree cracked and toppled.  Mum’s ears\r\nstood perfectly erect; and ere the branches had time to sway back, from\r\ntheir crash upon the ground, he was among them, growling at something\r\nupon which he had pounced.  It was the opossum; and like all the rest of\r\nits tribe when in the presence of an enemy, it seemed to be stone dead.\r\nThey took it up by its scaly, rat-like tail, and again went on.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a short walk they took a second, and on their way back,\r\na third.  These were quite as many as they could conveniently carry; and\r\ntaking their captives home, they made them secure, by tying a forked\r\nstick around the neck of each, on the plan of a pig-yoke.  From the\r\nmoment that these singular animals found themselves in the power of\r\ntheir enemies, they put on all the usual appearances of death; not a\r\nmuscle twitched, nothing stirred or trembled; each limb was stiff, and\r\neach eye closed; not even the growl or grip of the dogs was sufficient\r\nto disturb their perfect repose.  Robert could scarcely persuade himself\r\nthat they were not really dead.  Harold laughed.\r\n\r\n\"They can stand the crash of a tree and the worrying of dogs,\" he said,\r\nafter they were made secure; \"but there is one thing which they cannot\r\nstand.  See here!\" and he poured a cupful of cold water on each.  The\r\nshock seemed to be electric.  Each dead opossum was galvanized into\r\nlife, and pulled stoutly to break away from its wooden fetters.  \"Now\r\nlet us to bed.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANK AND HIS \"PIGS\"--THE CAGE--WALK ON THE BEACH--IMMENSE CRAWFISH--THE\r\nMUSEUM--NAMING THE ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nFrank’s first words the next morning, as in his night-clothes he ran\r\nfrom Mary’s room, were, \"Have you brought my pig?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! yes!\" they answered, \"three of them; and all yoked to boot, so\r\nthat they cannot get either into the garden or the cornfield.\"\r\n\r\nFrank did not comprehend this enigmatical language; he hastily dressed\r\nand went out.  Close to the awning he found the new comers sitting, each\r\nsecured by the novel pillory which Harold had contrived.  They were ugly\r\nlooking creatures, with long, hypocritical faces, coarse, grizzly hair,\r\nand an expression of countenance exceedingly contemptible.  Frank had\r\noften seen opossums before, but the fancy name of pigs had caused him\r\nmentally to invest them with the neat and comely aspect of the little\r\ngrunters at home.  When he hurried from the tent, and saw them in their\r\nnative ugliness, writhing their naked, snakey tails, he turned away with\r\nunaffected disgust.\r\n\r\n\"They are not very pretty,\" said Harold, watching the changes that\r\nflitted across the little fellow’s face.\r\n\r\n\"No, indeed,\" he replied; \"they are the ugliest things I ever saw.  You\r\nmay keep them and feed them yourself; for I will not have them for\r\nmine.\"\r\n\r\nThe unsightly appearance of the opossum excites in many persons a\r\nprejudice against its use for the table. But when young and tender, or\r\nafter having been kept for several days, its flesh is so nearly in taste\r\nlike that of a roast pig, that few persons can distinguish the\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nA cage for the captives was soon constructed, of poles several inches in\r\ndiameter, notched into each other, and approaching at the top like a\r\nstick trap.  The floor was also guarded with poles, to prevent their\r\nburrowing out.\r\n\r\n\"Now we need one or two troughs for their water and food,\" observed\r\nHarold, after the prisoners, loosed from their neck-locks, had been\r\nintroduced into the airy saloon erected for their accommodation.  \"I\r\npropose, therefore, that Mary and Frank shall go with one of us to Shell\r\nBluff, and bring home a supply of conch shells, to be converted, as we\r\nneed them, into troughs, cups, dippers, and trumpets.\"\r\n\r\nMary and Frank needed no persuasion to go upon this excursion, after the\r\nglowing description given by the boys on their return from the beach.\r\nRobert preferred to remain with Sam.  The others set off--Harold with\r\nhis gun, which, for reasons of policy, was an inseparable companion,\r\nMary with a basket, and Frank with his dog and hatchet.  On arriving at\r\nthe beach, down which they were to pass for a mile or more, the\r\nyoungsters amused themselves for a time with writing names, or making\r\ngrotesque figures in the hard smooth sand; then ran to overtake Harold,\r\nwho had walked slowly on, watching the sea-gulls plunge after their prey\r\non the surface of the water; for a short distance they went with him\r\nside by side, chatting through mere excitement; then dashing far ahead,\r\nthey picked up shells and other curiosities thrown up from the sea.\r\nSeveral times was Mary’s basket filled with prizes, and afterwards\r\nemptied for others still more beautiful, before they reached the place\r\nwhich the boys had named \"Shell Bluff.\"\r\n\r\nThe beach at that place was lovely indeed.  For half a mile or more it\r\nlooked like snow, mottled with rose colour here, and with dark brown\r\nthere; while, crowning the bluff above, waved a cluster of tropical\r\npalmettoes, around whose bases gathered the dark and fragrant cedar.\r\n\r\nAgain Mary replenished her basket, Frank filled every pocket he had, and\r\nhis cap besides, and Harold collected his handkerchief full of\r\nfine-looking conch shells.  They were about returning, when their\r\nattention was attracted by the shell of an enormous crawfish, whose body\r\nalone was nearly a foot long, and whose claws, extending far in front,\r\nwere of hideous dimensions.  This last Harold said he must take home for\r\n\"Mr. Philosopher Robert,\" and learn from him what it was.\r\n\r\nRobert was much pleased to see the collections they had made, and\r\nparticularly so with the shell.  He said that this was another proof, if\r\nhe needed any other, to show that they were on the western coast of\r\nSouth Florida, for he had often heard of the enormous crawfish that\r\nabounded there, and that were almost equal in size to the lobster.\r\n\r\n\"Let us be sure, Harold,\" said he, \"to put it beside your oyster, with\r\nthe raccoon’s foot, as the beginning of a museum gathered from the\r\nisland.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; and our rattlesnake’s skin,\" Frank added.\r\n\r\n\"And our turkey’s tail, and Frank’s plume,\" said Mary.  \"We have the\r\nbeginning of a museum already; for there are besides these things about\r\ntwenty varieties of shells and sea-weeds in this basket, some of which I\r\nnever saw before.\"\r\n\r\nHarold was as much interested as any in the idea of a museum; for though\r\nhe knew nothing of its proper arrangement, he had good sense enough to\r\nperceive that it was a very ready means of acquiring and retaining\r\nknowledge.\r\n\r\n\"But the name of this island,\" said Robert, musing; \"I have several\r\ntimes wished that we had one.  And why should we not, for who has a\r\nbetter right to give it a name than we, its only inhabitants?\"\r\n\r\nHe expressed the mind of the whole company, and they soon proceeded to\r\ncall upon each other for nominations.  \"The rule in such cases, I have\r\nheard, is to begin with the youngest,\" said Robert.  \"So Master Frank,\r\ndo you tell us what you would have it called.\"\r\n\r\nFrank mused a moment, and replied, \"I will call it Turkey Island;\r\nbecause turkeys were the first thing we saw here.\"\r\n\r\n\"My name, I think, will be the Island of Hope,\" said Mary, as her\r\nbrother’s eye rested on her.  \"We have certainly been _hoping_ ever\r\nsince we came, and will continue to hope until we get away.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, but we sometimes despaired, too,\" answered Robert, \"especially on\r\nthe morning after the storm.  I have thought of the Caloosa name--the\r\nEnchanted Island.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, Massa,\" Sam implored, \"don’t call um by dat name.  I begin to\r\nsee ghosts now; and I ’fraid, if you call um so, I will see ghosts and\r\nsperits all de time.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think a more suitable name still,\" said Harold, \"is the Island of\r\nRefuge.  It has certainly been to us a refuge from the sea, and from the\r\nstorm.  And if it is the Enchanted Island, of which Riley spoke, it will\r\nalso prove a refuge from the Indians, for none will dare to trouble us\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\nSam declined suggesting any name.  He said, pointing across the river to\r\nthe bluff, where he had met with his accident, \"Dat my place, obe’\r\nturrah side;[#] and my name for him is Poor Hope.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[#] That is my place, over the other side.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name decided by universal acclamation, was THE ISLAND OF REFUGE.\r\n\r\n\"I wish we had a horn of oil,\" said Robert, \"I would anoint it, as\r\ndiscoverers are said to do.  And if any person could suggest an\r\nappropriate speech I would repeat it on the occasion; but the only words\r\nI can think of now are,\r\n\r\n’Isle of Beauty, fare thee well!’\r\n\r\nAnd much as I admire everything around, I hope ere long to repeat those\r\nwords in truth.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHEIR SECOND SABBATH ON THE ISLAND, AND THE WAY THEY SPENT IT\r\n\r\n\r\nOn coming together in the morning, Robert proposed that they should add\r\nto their usual religious exercises the singing of a hymn.  \"It is\r\nfather’s plan,\" said he, \"to mark the Sabbath with as many pleasant\r\npeculiarities as possible.\"\r\n\r\nHarold was gratified with the suggestion, but remarked, \"As I cannot\r\nsing, you must allow me to join you in my heart, or else to assist the\r\nmusic with my flute.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, the flute, by all means!\" Mary replied.  \"And see here what a\r\nbeautiful hymn I have just found!\"\r\n\r\nRobert took the book, and read with remarkable appropriateness of tone\r\nand manner that exquisite hymn by Dr. Watts, beginning\r\n\r\n\"My God, how endless is thy love!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe music that morning was unusually sweet.  The voices of the singers\r\nwere rendered plaintive by a consciousness of their helpless situation;\r\nand the rich tones of the flute, together with Sam’s African voice,\r\nwhich was marked by indescribable mellowness, added greatly to the\r\neffect.\r\n\r\nThe subject of the chapter was the parable of the prodigal son.  Sam,\r\npoor fellow, raised himself on his elbow, and listened attentively; his\r\nremark made afterwards to Mary, showed that, however far beyond his\r\ncomprehension a great part of the parable may have been, he had caught\r\nits general drift and meaning.  \"De Lord is berry kind; he meet de\r\nsinner afore he get home, and forgib him ebbery ting.\"\r\n\r\nAbout nine o’clock the young people separated, with the understanding\r\nthat they were to re-assemble at eleven, for the purpose of reading the\r\nScriptures, and of conversation about its teachings.\r\n\r\nRobert went to the beach, and taking his seat upon a log, near the\r\nflag-staff, looked upon the ocean, and engaged in deep reflection upon\r\ntheir lonely situation, and the waning prospects of their deliverance.\r\nHis Testament gradually slipped from his grasp, and his head sunk\r\nbetween his knees.  Such was his absorption of mind, that the big drops\r\ngathered upon his forehead, and he was conscious of nothing except of\r\nhis separation from home, and of the necessity for exertion.  At last he\r\nheard a voice from the tent.  Harold and Mary were beckoning to him; and\r\nlooking up to the sun, he saw that eleven o’clock had come and passed.\r\nHe sprang to his feet, and in doing so, was rebuked to see lying on the\r\nground the Testament which he had taken to read, but had not opened.\r\n\r\nHarold, on leaving the tent, took his pocket Bible and strolled up the\r\nriver bank, to a pleasant cluster of trees, where he selected a seat\r\nupon the projecting root of a large magnolia.  His mind also reverted\r\nnaturally to their lonely situation; but he checked the rising thoughts,\r\nby saying to himself, \"No.  I have time enough during the week for\r\nthoughts like these.  The Sabbath is given for another purpose, which it\r\nwill not do for me longer to neglect.  When the Lord delivered us in\r\nthat strange way at sea, I resolved to live like a Christian, but I have\r\nneither lived nor felt as I ought.  The Lord forgive me for my neglect,\r\nand help me to do better.\"  He knelt down, and for several minutes was\r\nengaged in endeavouring to realize that he was in the presence of God.\r\nHis first words were a hearty confession that, although he had been\r\nearly taught to know his duty, he had not done it, nor had the heart to\r\ndo it; and, though in the experience of countless blessings, he had\r\nnever been grateful for any until the time of that unexpected\r\ndeliverance.  He thanked God for having taught him by that dreadful\r\naccident to feel that he was a sinner, and that it was a terrible thing\r\nto live and to die such. He said he knew there were promises, many and\r\ngreat, to all who would repent of sin, and believe in Jesus Christ, and\r\nhe prayed that God would enable him so to repent and believe, as to feel\r\nthat the promises were made to him.\r\n\r\nRising from his knees, and sitting upon the root of the tree, he opened\r\nthe Bible, and his eye rested upon the fifty-fifth chapter of Isaiah,\r\n\"Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters, and he that hath\r\nno money; come ye, buy and eat; yea, come; buy wine and milk, without\r\nmoney and without price.\"  Here he stopped, for his eyes filled, and the\r\npage became obscured.  He put his hands to his face, and thought, \"That\r\npassage surely describes _me_.  I came to this spot as a thirsty person\r\ngoes to a spring.  My soul longs for something, I know not what, except\r\nthat God only can supply it, and that I have nothing to offer for its\r\npurchase.  Now God says that he will _give_ it, ’without money and\r\nwithout price.’  O, what a blessing!  O, how merciful!  Let me see that\r\npassage again.\"\r\n\r\nHe re-opened the Bible, which had been laid in his lap, but the place\r\nhad not been marked, and was not to be found.  After searching some\r\ntime, he turned to the New Testament, and having opened it at the\r\nEpistle to the Romans, was turning back to the Gospels, when his eye was\r\ncaught by these words (contained in the seventh and eighth verses of the\r\nfourth chapter of Romans): \"Blessed are they whose iniquities are\r\nforgiven, and whose sins are covered.  Blessed is the man to whom the\r\nLord will not impute sin.\"  \"Ah, yes!\" he exclaimed, \"how true that is!\r\nThere is no blessing like it.\"  Supposing that something might be said\r\nin the chapter to show how sin may be forgiven and covered, he read the\r\nchapter through, but was disappointed.  The only clear idea he gained\r\nwas that Abraham was counted righteous, and was saved, not by his works,\r\nbut by his faith.  This confused him.  \"I always thought,\" said he,\r\n\"that people were saved because they were good. But this teaches,--let\r\nme see what,\"--at this time his eye rested on the words, \"Now it was not\r\nwritten for his sake alone (viz. that Abraham’s faith was imputed to him\r\nfor righteousness), but FOR US ALSO, _to whom_ it shall be imputed, if\r\nwe believe on him that raised up Jesus, our Lord, from the dead, who was\r\ndelivered for our offences, and was raised again for our justification.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, there comes my case again!\" he mentally exclaimed.  \"It does seem\r\nas if God is opening to me the scriptures.  This fact, about Abraham,\r\nwas _recorded_ not for his sake, but FOR OUR SAKES _now_.  And the\r\nblessing bestowed on him (that is, the forgiveness of sin), shall be\r\nbestowed on us too, ’if we believe on Him (that is, God the Father),\r\nthat raised up Jesus from the dead, who was delivered (that is, given up\r\nto death--put to death) for our offences, but raised again for our\r\njustification.’  But justification, what does that mean?\"\r\n\r\nHe glanced his eye over the chapter.  It flashed upon him that\r\njustification means nothing more nor less than what Paul had been\r\nspeaking of throughout the whole chapter.  Abraham was \"justified\"--that\r\nis, \"sin was not imputed to him\"--he was \"counted righteous,\" on account\r\nof his faith.  Now he understood the passage. It declared that we too\r\nshall be justified, if we believe on God, who gave up Jesus to suffer\r\nfor our sins, and who raised him again that we might be counted\r\nrighteous.\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had conceived this idea, and had certified his mind of its\r\ncorrectness, by reading the passage over several times, he fell once\r\nmore upon his knees, and said, \"O Lord, I am a sinner.  But thou hast\r\nsaid, ’Ho, every one that thirsteth, come ye to the waters; and he that\r\nhath no money.’  I come as a sinner, thirsting for pardon, but having no\r\nmoney to offer for its purchase. My only hope is in Thy promise.  I\r\nplead it now before Thee.  Thou hast promised, that as Abraham was\r\njustified by faith, so shall we be, if we believe on Thee, who didst\r\nraise Jesus from the dead.  Lord, I believe; help thou my unbelief.\r\nAccept of me as righteous in thy sight, not because I am righteous--for\r\nI am not, but because Jesus Christ was delivered for our offences, and\r\nraised again for our justification.  Forgive my iniquities, cover my\r\nsins, and make me all that thou wouldst have me be, for Jesus Christ’s\r\nsake.  Amen.\"\r\n\r\nFor some minutes he continued kneeling; his eyes were closed, his hands\r\nclasped, and his bowed face marked by strong emotion.  It was pleasant\r\nto be thus engaged.  He had experienced for the first time the\r\nblessedness of drawing near to God, and now he was listening to that\r\n\"still small voice,\" that spoke peace to his inmost soul.\r\n\r\nOnce more he sat upon the rough root of the tree. He opened his Bible to\r\nthe same page which had been so instructive, but it was to the next\r\nchapter, where he read: \"Therefore, being justified by faith, we have\r\npeace with God, through our Lord Jesus Christ.\"  \"Yes, yes,\" he\r\nmurmured, as his hand sought his bosom. \"Peace indeed!  Peace with God!\r\nPeace through our Lord Jesus Christ--and justified by faith.\"  He\r\ncontinued reading:\r\n\r\n\"By whom we have access by faith into this grace wherein we stand, and\r\nrejoice in hope of the glory of God.  And not only so, but we glory in\r\ntribulations also; knowing that tribulation worketh patience, and\r\npatience experience, and experience hope, and hope maketh not ashamed,\r\nbecause the love of God is shed abroad in our hearts, by the Holy Ghost\r\nwhich is given unto us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! is not this true?\" he joyfully soliloquized.  \"We glory in\r\ntribulations.  I used to wonder how people could glory in trouble.  But\r\nnow, thanks to God for trouble! especially for the trouble that brought\r\nus to this island, and brought me to Jesus Christ!  Yes, _thanks to God\r\nfor trouble_!\"\r\n\r\nHaving read the chapter to the end, and found, as is usual with persons\r\nin his state of mind, that although he could not understand it all,\r\nthere was scarcely a verse in which he did not discover something\r\nsuitable to his case, he knelt down and consecrated himself to God;\r\npraying that the Lord would grant him grace to live as a Christian, and\r\nmore particularly so to live, as to be the means of bringing his young\r\ncompanions to a knowledge of the truth.  As he closed his prayer, the\r\nwords of the morning hymn rose vividly to his recollection; he did not\r\nindeed use them as any part of his address to a throne of grace, but he\r\nused them as uttering beautifully the language of his own heart in that\r\nsweet communion to which he was now initiated.\r\n\r\n\"I yield my powers to thy command,\r\nTo thee I consecrate my days;\r\nPerpetual blessings from thy hand\r\nDemand perpetual songs of praise.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLooking at his watch he saw that the hour of eleven was at hand.  He\r\nturned his face toward the tent, and walked slowly onward, and as he\r\nwent his lips continually murmured,\r\n\r\n\"Perpetual blessings from thy hand,\r\nDemand perpetual songs of praise.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile Robert and Harold were thus engaged, Mary told Frank to amuse\r\nhimself not far away, and that after she had looked over her own lessons\r\nshe would call for him.  In the act of going to her room, she was\r\narrested by the voice of Sam, who said:\r\n\r\n\"Please, misses, Mas Robert and Mas Harold both gone away; and if you\r\ncan, read some of the Bible to your poor sick servant--do, misses.\"\r\n\r\nTouched by his melancholy earnestness, she promised to do so with\r\npleasure, after having finished Frank’s lessons and her own; and indeed,\r\nurged on by his apparent thankfulness, she dispatched her task in\r\none-half the usual time, and then called for Frank.\r\n\r\n\"What! have you learned your lessons already?\" he asked, in some\r\nsurprise.  She replied, \"Yes.\"  \"Then,\" said he, \"I wish you would make\r\nmine as short, for it took you a very little while.\"  But when she\r\ninformed him of the secret of her rapidity, and he heard a plaintive,\r\nhalf-devotional sigh from Sam’s corner, he said, \"Get the book, sister;\r\nI will learn as fast as I can, and then we can both go and sit by him,\r\nwhile you read.\"  Mary patted his cheek, saying that he was a good\r\nfellow, whenever he chose to be; and giving him the book, he stood by\r\nher side, and learnt his lessons very soon, and very well.\r\n\r\nThe chapter selected at Sam’s request was the third of John.  With this\r\nhe was so well acquainted as to be able to repeat verse after verse,\r\nwhile Mary was reading, and he seemed withal to have a very clear idea\r\nof its meaning.  Mary was surprised.  She knew that her father was in\r\nthe habit of calling his plantation negroes together on Sabbath\r\nevenings, and instructing them from the Scriptures, but she had no idea\r\nthat the impressions made by his labour had been so deep.\r\n\r\nIt was not until half-past eleven that they were all assembled and\r\ncomposed.  They sang several hymns, then conversed freely upon the\r\nsubject of the chapter, which had interested them in the morning, and on\r\nwhich they had promised to reflect.  These exercises occupied them so\r\npleasantly that it was past the usual hour ere any one thought of\r\ndinner.\r\n\r\nA part of Dr. Gordon’s custom had been to call upon each of his children\r\nevery day at their midday meal, to tell what \"new knowledge\" they had\r\ngained since that hour of the day preceding.  On Sundays the same plan\r\nwas pursued, except that the knowledge was required to be suitable to\r\nthe day.  This practice was on the present occasion resumed by the young\r\npeople. Frank’s new knowledge consisted of part of his morning lesson;\r\nMary’s, of a new method devised by her for remembering the order of\r\ncertain books in the Bible; Robert’s, of the aim and object of the\r\nparable just discussed: it was a keen rebuke to the Scribes and\r\nPharisees, who murmured against Jesus for receiving sinners and eating\r\nwith them.  When Harold’s turn came, he spoke with much emotion, and a\r\nface radiant with pleasure.  He said that he had on that day learnt the\r\nmost important lesson of his life; how good the Lord is, and how great a\r\nsinner he himself had been; he had learnt how to love Him, and how to\r\ntrust Him; how to read the Bible, and how to pray.  He was not able to\r\ntell how it happened, but there was now a meaning in the Scriptures, and\r\na sweetness in prayer, that he had never before suspected, and that he\r\nhoped it would last for ever.  He concluded by saying that he could\r\nconceive of no greater blessing than that of being enabled to feel all\r\nhis life-long as he felt that morning, after promising to try to live\r\nlike a Christian.\r\n\r\nTo these remarks of Harold no one made reply.  Robert looked down a\r\nmoment, then directed his gaze far away, as if disturbed by some painful\r\nrecollection. Mary gazed wistfully on her cousin, and covered her face\r\nwith both hands.  Frank slid from his seat, and coming to Harold’s side,\r\ninsinuated himself upon his knee, and looked affectionately into his\r\nface.  All felt that a great event had happened in their little circle;\r\nand that from that time forth their amiable cousin was in a most\r\nimportant sense their superior.  They separated in silence, Robert going\r\nto the spring, Mary to her room, and Harold to talk with Sam.\r\n\r\nLate in the afternoon they went together to the seashore, and sitting\r\naround their flag-staff, on the clear white sand, looked over the gently\r\nrippling waters, and talked thankfully of their merciful deliverance,\r\nand of their pleasant Island of Refuge.  The air became chilly, and the\r\nstars peeped out, before they sought the tent. Again soft music stole\r\nupon the night air, and floated far over the sands and waters.  Then all\r\nwas hushed.  The youthful worshippers had retired.  And so softly did\r\nsleep descend upon their eyelids, and so peacefully did the night pass,\r\nthat one might almost have fancied angels had become their guardians,\r\nwere it not for the still more animating thought that the _God_ of the\r\nangels was there, and that He \"gave his beloved sleep.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nMOTE IN THE EYE, AND HOW IT WAS REMOVED--CONCH TRUMPET AND\r\nSIGNALS--TRAMP--ALARM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, while planning together the employments of the day,\r\nFrank came in, holding his hand over his eye, having had a grain of sand\r\nthrown into it by an unfortunate twitch of Dora’s tail.  It pained him\r\nexcessively, and he found it almost impossible to keep from crying.\r\nMary ran quickly and brought a basin, for the purpose of his washing it\r\nout. He however became frightened at finding his mouth and nose\r\nimmersed, and was near being strangled in the attempt.  It would have\r\nbeen better for so young a person, if Mary had made him hold back his\r\nhead, and dropped the water under the uplifted lid.  She next proposed\r\nto remove it by introducing the smooth head of a large needle to the\r\npainful spot, and moving the mote away; but neither would Frank allow\r\nthis.  Robert then took the matter in hand, and having in vain blown and\r\nrubbed in various ways, endeavoured to remove the substance by drawing\r\nthe irritated lid over the other, in such a way as to make the lash of\r\none a sort of wiper to the other.  But neither did this succeed.  By\r\nthis time the eye had become much inflamed, and Frank began to whimper.\r\nHarold asked him to bear it for a minute longer, and he would try old\r\nTorgah’s plan.  With a black filament of moss, the best substitute he\r\ncould devise for a horse hair, he made a little loop, which he inserted\r\nunder the uplifted lid, so as to enclose the foreign substance; then\r\nletting the lid fall, he drew out the loop, and within it the grain of\r\nsand.  Robert observed that an almost infallible remedy is to bandage\r\nthe eye and take a nap; and Mary added, that it would be still more\r\ncertain if a flaxseed were put into the eye before going to sleep.\r\nFrank, however, needed no further treatment; he bathed his eye with cold\r\nwater, wore a bandage for an hour, and then was as well as ever.\r\n\r\nDuring the conversation that preceded this incident, Harold had brought\r\nout a hammer and large nail, and now occupied himself with making a\r\nsmooth hole in the small end of one of the conches.  Having succeeded,\r\nhe put the conch to his lips, and after several trials brought from it a\r\nloud clear note like that of a bugle.  Robert also, finding that the\r\nsound came easily, called aloud, \"Come here, sister, let us teach you\r\nhow to blow a trumpet.\"\r\n\r\nIt was not until after several attempts that Mary acquired the art.\r\nFrank was much amused to see how she twisted and screwed her mouth to\r\nmake it fit the hole; and though he said nothing at the time, Harold had\r\nafterwards reason to remember a lurking expression of sly humour dancing\r\nabout the corners of his mouth and eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Now, cousin,\" said Harold, when Mary had succeeded in bringing out the\r\nnotes with sufficient clearness, \"if ever you wish to call us home when\r\nwe are within a mile of you at night, or half a mile during the day, you\r\nhave only to use this trumpet.  For an ordinary call, sound a long loud\r\nblast, but for _an alarm_, if there should be such a thing, sound two\r\nlong blasts, with the interval of a second.  When you wish to call for\r\nFrank, sound a short blast, for Robert two, and for me three.\r\n\r\nIn his different strolls through the forest, Harold had observed that\r\nthe wild turkeys frequented certain oaks, whose acorns were small and\r\nsweet.  It was part of his plan to capture a number of these birds in a\r\ntrap, and to keep them on hand as poultry, to be killed at pleasure. For\r\nthis purpose, it was necessary that the spot where the trap was to be\r\nset should first be baited.  He therefore proposed to Robert to spend\r\npart of the forenoon in selecting and baiting several places; and with\r\nthis intention they left home, having their pockets filled with corn and\r\npeas.  It did not require long to select half a dozen such places,\r\nwithin a moderate distance of the tent, to bait, and afterwards to mark\r\nthem so that they could be found.\r\n\r\nHaving completed this work, they were returning to the tent, when they\r\nheard afar off the sound of the conch.  It was indistinct and irregular\r\nat first, as if Mary had not been able to adjust her mouth properly to\r\nthe hole; but presently a note came to them so clear and emphatic, that\r\nMum pricked up his ears, and trotted briskly on; and after a second’s\r\npause came another long blast.  \"Harold!  Harold!\" Robert said in a\r\nquick and tremulous tone, \"that is an alarm!  I wonder what can be the\r\nmatter.  Now there are two short blasts; they are for me; and now three\r\nfor you.  Come, let us hurry. Something terrible must have happened to\r\nFrank or to Sam.\"\r\n\r\nThey quickened their pace to a run, and were bursting through the bushes\r\nand briers, when they again heard the two long blasts of alarm, followed\r\nby the short ones, that called for each of them.  They were seriously\r\ndisturbed, and continued their efforts until they came near enough to\r\nsee Mary walking about very composedly, and Frank sitting, not far from\r\nthe tent, with the conch lying at his feet.  These signs of tranquillity\r\nso far relieved their anxiety, that they slackened their pace to a\r\nmoderate walk, but their faces were red, and their breath short from\r\nexertion.  They began to hope that the alarm was on account of _good_\r\nnews instead of bad--perhaps the sight of a vessel on the coast.  Robert\r\nwas trembling with excitement.  A loud halloo roused the attention of\r\nFrank, and springing lightly to his feet he ran to meet them.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter?\" asked Robert; but either Frank did not hear, or\r\ndid not choose to reply.  He came up with a merry laugh, talking so fast\r\nand loud, as to drown all the questions.\r\n\r\n\"Ha! ha!\" said he, \"I thought I could bring you! That was loud and\r\nstrong, wasn’t it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You!\" Robert inquired.  \"What do you mean?  Did you blow the conch?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I did,\" he replied; \"I blew just as cousin Harold said we must, to\r\nbring you all home.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Frank,\" remonstrated Harold, \"the conch sounded an alarm.  It\r\nsaid, Something is the matter. Now what was the matter?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, not much,\" Frank answered, \"only I was getting hungry, and thought\r\nit was time for you all to come back.  That was something, wasn’t it?\"\r\n\r\n\"You wicked fellow!\" said Robert, provoked out of all patience, to think\r\nof their long run.  \"You have put us to a great deal of trouble.\r\nSister, how came you to let him frighten us so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Really, I could not help it,\" she replied.  \"When I went to the spring\r\na little while since, he excused himself from going by saying that he\r\nfelt tired; but no sooner had I passed below the bluff, than I heard the\r\nsound of the conch.  I supposed at first it must be Sam, who had become\r\nsuddenly worse, and was blowing for you to return; so I filled my bucket\r\nonly half full, and hurried home; when I ascended the bluff I saw the\r\nlittle monkey, with the conch in his hand, blowing away with all his\r\nmight.\"\r\n\r\n\"And didn’t it go well?\" asked Frank.\r\n\r\nThe young wag looked so innocent of every intent except fun, and seemed\r\nwithal to think his trick so clever, that in spite of their discomfort,\r\nthe boys laughed heartily at the consternation he had produced, and at\r\nthe half comic, half tragic expression which his face assumed on\r\nlearning the consequences of his waggery.  They gave him a serious\r\nlecture, however, upon the subject, and told him that hereafter he must\r\nnot interfere with the signals.  But as he seemed to have such an\r\nuncommon aptitude for trumpeting, Harold promised to prepare him a conch\r\nfor his own use, on condition that he played them no more tricks.  Frank\r\nwas delighted at this, and taking up the horn, blew, as he said, \"all\r\nsorts of crooked ways,\" to show what he could do.  The boys were\r\nastonished.  Frank was the most skilful trumpeter of the company; and on\r\nbeing questioned how he acquired the art, replied, that when he and his\r\nmother had gone on a visit to one of her friends, during the preceding\r\nsummer, he and a negro boy used to go after the cows every evening, and\r\nblow horns for their amusement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\r\nA HUNTER’S MISFORTUNE--RELIEF TO A SPRAIN--HOW TO AVOID BEING LOST IN\r\nTHE WOODS, AND TO RECOVER ONE’S COURSE AFTER BEING LOST--A STILL HUNT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was remarked by Mary the next morning, that if some one did not go\r\nout hunting they should soon be out of provision.  \"Which for our\r\ncharacter as marooners I hope will not be the case,\" rejoined Harold.\r\n\"Come, Robert, shall we be hunters today?\"\r\n\r\n\"We cannot do better,\" Robert languidly replied, \"unless we go fishing\r\ninstead.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, do let me go with you,\" begged Frank.  \"I am so tired of being\r\ncooped up here under this oak tree, and running for ever to the spring\r\nand to the oyster bank.  I want to go either hunting or fishing.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we can do both,\" said Mary, perceiving from Robert’s looks that\r\nhe was disinclined to any great exertion.  \"Cousin Harold can take Frank\r\nand go to the woods, while you and I, brother, can catch a mess of\r\nfish.\"\r\n\r\n\"That will do!  O, yes, that is the very plan,\" Frank exclaimed,\r\nclapping his hands.  \"Then we can run a race to see who shall do best.\"\r\n\r\nThe company separated; Harold took Frank and disappeared in the forest,\r\nwhere they were absent several hours, and Robert and Mary went to the\r\noyster bank, where they supplied themselves with bait, and then\r\nembarking on the raft, began to fish for sheepshead, near a log imbedded\r\nin the mud, and covered with barnacles and young oysters.  The success\r\nof the fishing party was very good; they soon had a basket half full of\r\nfish, and the remainder filled with shrimp.\r\n\r\nNot so with the hunters.  Robert and Mary were engaged in preparing\r\ntheir prizes for use, when they heard a sharp halloo, and saw Frank\r\nemerging from a dense growth of bushes, with the rifle upon his\r\nshoulder, followed by Harold, who was limping painfully, and beckoning\r\nthem to approach.\r\n\r\nWashing their hands with haste, Robert and Mary ran to meet them.\r\nHarold was seated on a log, looking very pale.  Within an hour after\r\nleaving the tent he had sprained his ankle, and ever since had been\r\nslowly and with great suffering attempting to return.  Mary was\r\nfrightened to see the haggard looks of her cousin, and inquired\r\nanxiously what she could do to help him.\r\n\r\n\"Take the gun, sister,\" said Robert.  \"Lean on me, cousin, I will\r\nsupport you to the tent, and then show you the best thing in the world\r\nfor a sprain.\"\r\n\r\nMary ran to the tent, put the gun in its place, prepared Harold’s couch,\r\nand then at Robert’s request hurried with Frank to the spring and\r\nbrought up a bucket of water, by the time that Harold’s shoe and\r\nstocking had been removed.  The ankle was much swollen, and the blood\r\nhad settled around it in deep blue clouds.\r\n\r\n\"Now, sister, bring me the coffee pot and a basin.\"\r\n\r\nThe basin was placed under the foot, and the coffee pot filled with cool\r\nwater was used to pour a small stream upon the injured part.  This\r\nprocess was continued for half an hour, by which time the inflammation\r\nand pain were greatly reduced.  It was also repeated several times that\r\nday, and once more before retiring to bed, the good effects being\r\nmanifest on each occasion.\r\n\r\nThis accident not only confined the whole company at home for the rest\r\nof the day, but caused an unpleasant conviction to press heavily upon\r\nthe mind of Robert--the whole responsibility of supplying the family\r\nwith food and other necessaries would for a time devolve upon himself.\r\nThis fact almost made him shudder, for though a willing boy, he was not\r\nrobust; labour was painful to him; at times he felt a great\r\ndisinclination to bodily effort, but the greatest difficulty in the way\r\nof his success in their present mode of life, was his ignorance of some\r\nof the most necessary arts of a hunter.\r\n\r\n\"Harold,\" said he, with a rueful face, the next morning, when they had\r\nfinished talking over the various means for discovering and approaching\r\ngame in the forest; \"to tell you the truth, I am afraid of _getting\r\nlost_ in these thick and tangled woods.  It is a perfect wonder to me\r\nhow you can dash on through bush and brier, and turn here and there, as\r\nif you knew every step of the way, when, if I were left alone, I should\r\nnever find my way home at all.  Now my head is easily turned, and when I\r\nam once lost, I am lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know exactly what you mean,\" replied Harold, \"and in former times I\r\nused to feel the same way.  But there are two or three rules which\r\nhelped me much, and which I will give to you.\r\n\r\n\"The first is, _never allow to yourself that you are lost_.  Say to\r\nyourself that you are mistaken, or that you have taken the wrong course,\r\nor anything that you will, but never allow the _lost feeling_ to come\r\nover you, so long as you can keep it off.\r\n\r\n\"When, however, you ascertain that you have unfortunately missed your\r\ntrack, your next rule is to sit down _as quietly as possible_ to\r\ndetermine your course.  Most people in such a case become excited, run\r\nhere and there, at perfect random, and become worse bewildered than\r\nbefore.  First do you determine the points of the compass, and then\r\nstrike for the point you are most certain of reaching.  For instance,\r\nyou know that anywhere on this island the sea lies to the west, and a\r\nriver to the north.  You can surely find either of these places; and\r\nwhen once found you will be no longer in doubt, although you may be far\r\nfrom home.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how am I to know the points of the compass?\" inquired Robert.\r\n\r\n\"Easily enough,\" his cousin replied.  \"But before speaking of that, let\r\nme give you my third rule, which is, _never get lost_.\"\r\n\r\nRobert laughed.  \"That is the only rule I want.  Give me that and you\r\nmay have the rest.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" continued Harold, \"make it your constant habit to notice the\r\ncourse you travel, and the time you are travelling.  Watch the sun, or\r\nelse the shadows of the trees, and the angle at which you cross them.\r\nEarly in the morning the shadows are very long, and point west.  In the\r\nmiddle of the forenoon, they are about as long as the trees that make\r\nthem, and all point north-west.  And at twelve o’clock they are very\r\nshort, and point due north.  To a woodsman the shadows are both clock\r\nand compass; and by keeping your mind on them, you can easily make what\r\nthe captain would call your _dead reckoning_.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Robert, \"what would you do on such a day as this, when there\r\nis neither sun nor shadow?\"\r\n\r\n\"You must work by another rule,\" he replied.  \"Old Torgah gave me three\r\nsigns for telling the points of the compass, by noticing the limbs, the\r\nbark, and the green moss on the trunks of trees _well exposed_ to the\r\nsun. Moss, you know, loves the shade, while the bark and limbs grow all\r\nthe faster for having plenty of light.  As a general rule, therefore,\r\nyou will find the south, or sunny side of a tree marked by large limbs\r\nand thick, rough bark, and the north side covered, more or less, with\r\nwhatever green moss there may be on it.[#]  Did I ever tell you how\r\nthese signs helped me once to find my way home?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[#] Happening not long since to converse with an old and observant\r\nfarmer, on the subject of these natural signs, he pointed out another.\r\n\r\n\"Notice,\" said he, \"the direction in which those trees _lean_.\"\r\n\r\nWe were in a pine forest, and, almost without exception, the trees that\r\ndeclined from a perpendicular leaned towards the east. The severe winds\r\nthrough the up country of South Carolina, Georgia and Alabama, which\r\nstart our trees and unsettle our fences, usually prevail from the west.\r\nThat is the point also from which almost invariably come our thunder\r\nstorms.\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert replied that he had not.  \"I was at my uncle’s, where I had never\r\nbeen before, in a newly settled part of the country.  A small stream ran\r\nnear his house, and bent considerably around his plantation.  Down this\r\nstream I followed one day, in search of ducks, and walked several miles\r\nbefore thinking of home.  My uncle’s house lay due east, and instead of\r\nreturning the way I went, I determined to take a shorter course through\r\nthe woods.  I had not gone far, however, before a fat squirrel jumped\r\nupon a log, within good shooting distance, curled his tail over his\r\nback, and sat there barking; he seemed to give me every invitation that\r\na squirrel possibly could to shoot him, and I did so.  But it was really\r\ncurious to see the consequence.  Such a barking of squirrels I never\r\nheard before in my life. They were all around me, jumping, shaking their\r\ntails, and _quaw-quawing_ at such a rate, that it was almost like\r\nwitchcraft.  I killed as many as I could carry, and once more set out\r\nfor home.  But I had completely lost my course; the chase had taken off\r\nmy mind, and I could tell neither which way I came into the wood, nor\r\nhow I was to go out of it.  My uncle’s house I knew lay to the east, and\r\nthe stream to the north.  But which way was east, and which north?  The\r\nsun was hidden, and the trees were so close and thick, that the moss\r\ncovered their large trunks on every side, and the limbs and bark for the\r\nsame reason seemed to be of equal size all round.  At last I spied a\r\nsmall tree, that was pretty well exposed to the sun, and the limbs of\r\nwhich were evidently larger, and the bark rougher on one side than on\r\nthe other; there was also a beautiful tuft of green moss growing at its\r\nroot, on the side opposite to the large limbs.  These signs satisfied\r\nme; but to make assurance doubly sure, I cut into the tree far enough to\r\nascertain that the thickest bark was on the roughest side.  That one\r\ntree was my guide.  I struck a straight course for home, and reached it\r\nwithout difficulty.  Now, if you take these rules, you can guide\r\nyourself anywhere through these woods, in which you will never be more\r\nthan three or four miles to the east of the sea-shore.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you, cousin,\" said Robert; \"thank you sincerely.  You have\r\nrelieved my mind from the greatest embarrassment I have felt at the\r\nthought of roaming these dark woods alone.  Your rules give me\r\nconfidence; for the very trees that before caused my bewilderment shall\r\nnow become my guides.\"\r\n\r\nHe took his gun, called his dog, and gave a look to Frank, in the\r\nexpectation that he also would come. But Frank had listened quietly to\r\nthe preceding conversation, and had as quietly made up his mind not to\r\ngo.  He sat beside the cage, watching the opossum, and took no notice of\r\ndog, gun, or look.\r\n\r\n\"Jump, Frank,\" said Robert, in a cheering tone; \"I am ready to go.  Let\r\nus see if we cannot find a deer.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I thank you,\" he soberly replied; \"I do not love to get lost.  It\r\ndoes not feel pleasant.  I had rather stay at home and pour water on\r\ncousin Harold’s foot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then stay,\" said Robert, in a disappointed tone; \"I forgot that you\r\nwere a baby.\"\r\n\r\nHarold, however, who knew that Frank was an uncommon pedestrian, and\r\nthat Robert preferred to have company, whispered to him, \"He is not\r\ngoing to lose himself, Frank.  I think, too, he will kill some deer, and\r\nwho knows but he may find another fawn to keep Dora company.\"  Frank\r\nseized his cap, and calling out, \"Brother! brother!  I am coming!\"\r\ndashed off in pursuit.  Fidelle started too, but they returned to tie\r\nher up, and to say to Mary that she must not be uneasy if they did not\r\nreturn by dinner-time, as they were unwilling to come without game; then\r\ntaking some parched corn in their pockets in case of hunger, together\r\nwith Frank’s hatchet and matches, they again set off.\r\n\r\nThe first business was to visit the turkey baits; at one of which the\r\ncorn and peas had all disappeared, with evident traces of having been\r\neaten by turkeys.  \"What a pity we had not brought some more bait,\"\r\nremarked Robert; \"Harold says that when they have once found food at a\r\nplace, they are almost sure to return the next day to look for more.  We\r\nmust share with them our dinner of parched corn.\"\r\n\r\nRenewing the bait, they proceeded in a straight course south, having for\r\ntheir guide the bright clouds that showed the place of the sun to the\r\nsouth-east.  Frank was very anxious for Robert to kill some of the many\r\nsquirrels that frolicked around them.  \"May be,\" said he, \"if you shoot,\r\nthey will quaw-quaw for you as they did for Cousin Harold, and then we\r\ncan go home loaded.\"  But Robert replied that this would be a useless\r\nwaste of ammunition: that it would probably scare off the deer from the\r\nneighbourhood; and that, moreover, his gun was not loaded for such small\r\ngame.\r\n\r\nHardly had the argument closed before Mum began to smell and snort, here\r\nand there, intent upon a confused trail.  His motion became soon more\r\nsteady, and he started off at a pace that made the hunters run to keep\r\nin sight.  Afraid that at this rate Frank would give out, and that he\r\nhimself would be too much out of breath to aim surely, or to creep\r\ncautiously upon the deer, Robert called out, \"Steady, Mum!\"  The\r\nwell-trained brute instantly slackened his speed, and keeping only about\r\na rod ahead, went forward at a moderate walk. In this way they followed\r\nfor a full quarter of a mile, when Robert observed him take his nose\r\nfrom the ground, and walk with noiseless step, keeping his eyes keenly\r\ndirected forwards.  He \"steadied\" him again by a half whispered command,\r\nand kept close at his heels.  Soon he saw a pair of antlers peering\r\nabove a distant thicket, and the brown side of a deer between the\r\nbranches. Softly ordering Mum to \"come in,\" and noticing that what\r\nlittle wind there was blew so as not to carry their scent to the deer,\r\nhe said to Frank, \"Buddy, if you will remain by this large poplar, I\r\nwill creep behind yonder thicket, and see if I cannot get a shot.  Will\r\nyou be afraid?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he replied, \"if you do not go too far away.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will not go out of hearing,\" Robert said, \"and if you need anything,\r\nwhistle for me, but do not call. Hide yourself behind this tree, and\r\nwhen you hear me shoot, come as soon as you please.\"\r\n\r\nIt was easy to cover his advance behind the dense foliage of a viny\r\nbower, until he was quite near.  He paused to listen; the rustle of\r\nleaves and the sound of stamping feet were distinctly heard.  A short\r\nbut cautious movement gave him a commanding view of the ground.  There\r\nwere three deer feeding within easy reach of his shot.  He sprung both\r\nbarrels, and tried to be deliberate, but in spite of all resolution his\r\nheart jumped into his mouth, and his hand shook violently; he had what\r\nhunters call \"the buck-ague.\"  Steadying his piece against a stout\r\nbranch, he aimed at the shoulders of the largest, and fired.  It fell,\r\nwith a bound forward. The other deer, instead of darting away, as he\r\nexpected, turned in apparent surprise to look at the unusual vision of\r\nsmoke and fire, accompanied by such a noise, when he took deliberate aim\r\nwith a now steady hand, and fired at the head of the next largest, as it\r\nwas in the act of springing away.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Frank! come!\" he shouted.\r\n\r\nFrank, however, had started at the first report, and was now running at\r\nthe top of his speed.  Robert rushed forward to dye his hand for the\r\nfirst time in the blood of so noble a victim; yet it made him almost\r\nshudder to hear the knife grate through the delicate flesh, and to see\r\nthe rich blood gurgling upon the ground.  Had it not been that such\r\nbutchery was necessary to subsistence, he would have resolved at that\r\nmoment to repeat it no more.\r\n\r\nBut what was next to be done?  Here were two large deer lying upon the\r\nearth.  Should he skin and cleanse them there, and attempt to carry home\r\nthe divided quarters? or should he carry home one deer and return for\r\nthe other?  He decided upon the last.  Before proceeding homewards,\r\nhowever, he blazed a number of trees, to show afar off the place of his\r\ngame; then selecting a tree, as far as he could distinguish in his way,\r\nhe went towards it, chopping each bush and sapling with his hatchet; and\r\nmaking a broad blaze upon this tree, he selected another in the same\r\nline, and proceeded thus until he reached the tent.  He had learnt by\r\none-half day’s practice to thread the trackless forest with a steadiness\r\nof course and a confidence of spirit that were surprising to himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nCRUTCHES IN DEMAND--CURING VENISON--PEMMICAN--SCALDING OFF A PORKER’S\r\nHAIR WITH LEAVES AND WATER--TURKEY TROUGH--SOLITARY WATCHING--FORCE OF\r\nIMAGINATION--FEARFUL RENCOUNTER--DIFFERENT MODES OF REPELLING WILD\r\nBEASTS\r\n\r\n\r\nHarold’s ankle continued so painful whenever he attempted to move, that\r\nSam advised him, the morning after the accident, to construct for\r\nhimself a pair of crutches.  \"Make ’em strong and good, Mas Harol,\" said\r\nhe, with a broad grin of satisfaction.  \"I hope by time you trow ’em\r\naway, I’ll pick ’em up.\"  This work occupied the two invalids, while\r\nRobert and Frank were engaged in their successful deer hunt.\r\n\r\nWhen the venison was brought home, Harold assisted in various ways in\r\npreparing it for use; and also promised that if he was provided with the\r\nnecessary means, he would see that all which was thereafter brought in\r\nshould be properly cured.  His favourite mode was by the process called\r\n_jerking_.  The plan was this: A wig-wam was made, about five feet in\r\ndiameter at the base, and five feet high, leaving a hole at the top\r\nabout two feet wide.  A place for fire was scooped in the middle; and\r\nthe pieces of venison were hung in the smoke that poured through the\r\nopen top.  Pieces an inch thick, when exposed at the same time to smoke\r\nand sunshine were perfectly cured in the course of a day.  The hams\r\nrequired, of course, a longer time, and were all the better for a little\r\nsalt.  The _salting tub_ was made of a fresh deer’s skin, fleshy side\r\nup, supported by stakes so as to sag in the middle.  A substitute for a\r\n_pickle barrel_ was also devised in the course of time; this consisted\r\nof a deer’s skin, stripped off whole, and rendered water-tight by\r\nstopping the holes; in this the meat was put, covered with a strong\r\nbrine, and drawn up into a tree. When the visits of the flesh-fly were\r\napprehended, the mouth of the sack was secured by a string.  But the\r\nmost convenient form in which the meat was cured was that known as\r\n_pemmican_.  To prepare this the meat was jerked until perfectly dry,\r\nthen pounded fine, and mixed with half its own weight of melted grease;\r\nafter which it was packed away in skin bags, having the hair outwards.\r\nThe pemmican could be eaten, like bologna sausage, either cooked or raw,\r\nand kept perfectly sweet as long as it was needed.\r\n\r\nWhile describing these several modes of preparing and preserving their\r\nmeat, it may not be amiss to mention also a method adopted by Harold for\r\nscalding off an opossum’s hair without any of the usual appliances for\r\nheating the water.  The opossum had been killed before it was known that\r\nthe utensils for boiling were all in use and could not be spared.\r\nRobert was perplexed, for he knew that the hair \"sets\" as soon as the\r\ncarcass is cold, and refuses to be drawn.  But Harold replied with a\r\nsmile,\r\n\r\n\"I have seen hogs scalded by being put into a deep puddle of water\r\nheated with red hot stones.  All the water needed for so small an object\r\nas the opossum may be heated in a deer skin, hung like our salting tub\r\nover the fire.  But I will show you a still easier plan.\"\r\n\r\nHe gathered a pile of dry leaves, with which he covered the body, and\r\nthen poured on water until the pile was quite wet; after which he piled\r\non a much larger quantity of dry leaves, which he set on fire.  When the\r\nmass had burnt down, the hair of the opossum was found so thoroughly\r\n_steamed_ by the surrounding heat, that it yielded as easily as if it\r\nhad passed through the most approved process of the pork cleaning art.\r\n\r\nTowards sunset Robert went to the turkey baits; the birds had returned\r\nto the place they had visited before, and eaten all the parched corn\r\nthrown there the second time.  He renewed the bait, with this difference\r\n(made on Harold’s suggestion)--that whereas he had formerly scattered\r\nthe corn broad-cast, he now strewed it in a sort of trough, or shallow\r\ntrench, made in the ground.  This trench was made on a line proceeding\r\nstraight from a place of concealment, selected within good shooting\r\ndistance.  Turkeys are greedy feeders; and when they find a place baited\r\nas that was, they gather on each side of the trench, with their heads\r\nclose together, trying each to obtain his share of the prize; and a\r\nperson having a gun loaded with duck or squirrel shot, has been known to\r\nkill six or eight at a time, by firing among their interlocking heads.\r\n\r\nAn additional visit enabled Robert to determine that the hour of their\r\ncoming was early in the morning; and this being the only other\r\ncircumstance wanting to fix the time of his own coming to meet them, he\r\nused that opportunity to arrange to his fancy the place of his\r\nconcealment.  The trench was on a line with two short hedges of bamboo\r\nbrier, diverging from each other in the shape of the letter V, having a\r\nplace of egress at the angle.  He closed the mouth of the V by planting\r\na blind of evergreens, high as his head, and very close at the bottom;\r\nand as it was probable that he should be compelled to remain some hours\r\nin concealment, he made a seat, and opened through the blind a hole for\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nOn the following morning he was up and moving at the peep of day.  Mary\r\nprepared him a cup of coffee, and by the time that there was light\r\nsufficient to follow the blazed track he was on the way.  His course lay\r\neastward, and through the opening branches glowed that beautiful star\r\nwhich he had often admired, Venus, the gem of the morning, \"flaming upon\r\nthe forehead of the dawn.\"\r\n\r\nFrank begged hard to be allowed to go too, his confidence in Robert’s\r\nwoodsmanship having been greatly increased by the recent success; but\r\nHarold decided against him.  He said that in turkey shooting the fewer\r\npersons there were present the better; that Robert himself must keep\r\nstill as a mouse, and that well trained as Mum was, it would be better\r\neven for him to be left behind.  Robert therefore departed alone,\r\nputting into his pocket a small volume of Shakespeare, to aid in whiling\r\naway the slow hours of his solitary watch.\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the spot his first act was to see that the bait was yet\r\nuntouched.  He took his seat, and continued for a long time peeping\r\nthrough the port hole, and listening with an attention so acute that he\r\ncould hear the rush of his own blood along the throbbing arteries.  But\r\nas the minutes passed, and no change occurred, not even the chirp of a\r\nbird or the bark of a squirrel enlivening the grim solitude, his\r\nexcitement gradually gave way to weariness.  He leaned his gun against\r\nthe wall of vines, and drew out his book.  It was the first volume,\r\ncontaining that magnificent drama, \"The Tempest.\"  He read rapidly the\r\nfamiliar scenes describing Ariel, the light, invisible spirit, and\r\nCaliban, the hideous son of the old hag, and Prospero, with his\r\nbeautiful daughter, and the dripping refugees from the sea, and became\r\nso deeply absorbed as perfectly to forget where he was, until a slight\r\nrustling behind a briery thicket near the bait aroused his attention.\r\nWhatever the animal might have been, its step was very stealthy, and\r\nevidently approaching.  Laying down the book, and grasping his gun, he\r\npeeped cautiously around; nothing was visible.  Soon he heard a rattling\r\nupon the ground of falling fragments, as if from some animal climbing a\r\ntree, and a grating sound like that of bark which is grasped and\r\ncrushed.\r\n\r\n\"I wonder what that can be?\" he mentally soliloquized. \"Perhaps a large\r\nfox-squirrel climbing after acorns--but no, there is too much bark\r\nfalling for that. It must be a squirrel barking a dead limb for worms.\r\nThat’s it!  O, yes, that’s it.\"\r\n\r\nBut it was no squirrel, and had Robert been more of a woodsman he would\r\nnot have returned so quietly to his reading.  Indeed, he had become more\r\ndeeply interested in his book than in his business, and was glad of any\r\nexcuse that allowed him to return to Prospero and the shipwrecked crew.\r\nHe read a few pages more, and stopping to connect in his mind the\r\ndisjointed parts of the story, his eye rested upon what appeared to be\r\nthe bushy tail of a very large squirrel, lying upon a limb of the tree\r\nthat overhung the bait.\r\n\r\n\"I knew it was a squirrel,\" said he to himself; \"but he is a bouncer!\r\nHow long his tail is! and how it moves from side to side like a cat’s,\r\nwhen it sees a bird or a mouse that it is trying to catch.  I wish I\r\ncould see his body, but it is hidden by that bunch of leaves.\"\r\n\r\nHis imagination was so powerfully impressed with the graphic scenery of\r\n\"The Tempest,\" that he could scarcely think of anything else.  The idea\r\nin his mind at that moment was the ludicrous scene in which the drunken\r\nStephano comes upon the queer bundle, made up of Caliban and Trinculo,\r\nlying head to head under the same frock, and appearing to his unsteady\r\neyes like a monster with two pairs of legs at each end.  As Robert\r\nlooked into the tree, he almost laughed to catch himself fancying that\r\nhe saw Caliban’s head lying on the same limb on which lay the squirrel’s\r\ntail, and staring at him with its two great eyes.  Indeed he did see\r\nsomething. There was a veritable head resting there, and two great\r\neyeballs were glaring upon him, and nothing but the irresistible\r\ninfluence of the scenes he had read deceived him for a moment with the\r\nidea that it was Caliban’s.\r\n\r\nA second and steady look would probably have revealed the truth; but for\r\nthis he had not time.  The welcome \"twit! twit!\" of the expected game\r\ncaused him to look through his port hole, and a large turkey cock,\r\naccompanied by four hens, ran directly to the trench, and began to eat\r\nas fast as they could pick up the grains. Robert cautiously slipped his\r\ngun through the port hole, and took deliberate aim, confident that he\r\ncould kill the five at one shot.  But hesitating a moment whether he\r\nshould commit such wholesale destruction, when they were already so well\r\nsupplied with fresh meat, his gun made a slight noise against the\r\nleaves, which attracted the attention of the turkeys, and caused the\r\nhens to dart away.  The gobbler, being the leader and protector of the\r\nparty, stood his ground courageously, stretching his long neck full four\r\nfeet high, looking in every direction, and then coming cautiously\r\ntowards the blind to reconnoitre.\r\n\r\nRobert had gained experience from his still hunting; and in this\r\nconjuncture stood perfectly motionless, keeping his gun as immovable as\r\nthe stiff branch of a dry tree.  The bird was deceived.  It returned\r\nquietly to the trench, and commenced feeding.  Robert waited in the hope\r\nthat it would be joined by another; but no other coming, he fired while\r\nit was picking up the last few grains, and killed it.  The moment of\r\npulling the trigger, he heard a rustle of leaves in the tree above the\r\nturkey, and the moment after the report of his gun a heavy fall upon the\r\nground.  As he rushed from his concealment to seize the fallen game, he\r\nwas horrified to see an enormous beast of the cat kind, crushing the\r\nhead of the bird in its mouth, while its paw pinioned the fluttering\r\nwings.  It was a panther.  It had crawled into the tree while Robert was\r\nreading.  It was _its_ tail he had mistaken for a squirrel’s, and _its_\r\nhead he had fancied was Caliban’s.  For half an hour it had been glaring\r\nupon him with its big eyeballs, waiting until he should pass near enough\r\nto be pounced upon.\r\n\r\nThe coming of the turkeys had distracted its attention; and being\r\nhungry, it had ceased to watch for its human victim, and resolved upon\r\nthat which was surer.  When Robert emerged from his concealment it\r\nturned upon him, dropped the mangled head from its bloody mouth,\r\nreversed the hair on both back and tail, showed its enormous fangs, and\r\ngrowled.  Had he retreated from the field he might have escaped the\r\nterrible conflict that awaited him, for the panther, left to the\r\npeaceable possession of its prize, would probably have snatched it up\r\nand ran away.  But his horror at the sight was so great that for a\r\nmoment he was paralysed.  He convulsively clutched his gun, and was on\r\nthe point of firing almost without aim, when another fierce growl from\r\nthe panther, that appeared to be gathering itself for a leap, brought\r\nhim to his senses.  He took deliberate aim between its eyes, and fired.\r\nIt was a desperate chance, for the gun was loaded only with duck shot.\r\nThe howl of rage and pain with which the panther bounded upon him, and\r\nthe grinning horrible teeth that it showed, made his blood run cold.  He\r\nclubbed his gun, prepared to aim a heavy blow upon its forehead, but, to\r\nhis surprise, instead of leaping upon him, it sprang upon the thicket of\r\nbriers, about three feet distant, and began furiously to tear on every\r\nside at perfect random.\r\n\r\nHe needed no better chance to escape from so dangerous a neighbourhood;\r\nand, in the moment of leaving, saw that both eyes of the animal had been\r\nshot away, and that the bloody humour was streaming down its face. He\r\nhurried on for a few steps, but fearing that the frantic beast might\r\npursue him, he slipped behind a tree, and pouring hastily into his gun a\r\ncharge of powder, which he rammed down as he ran, put upon that a heavy\r\nload of deer shot, and then made his way homewards.\r\n\r\nEre he had run one-half the distance, however, his fears began to\r\nsubside.  The panther, if not mortally wounded, was stone-blind; why\r\nshould he not muster courage enough to complete the work, and thus\r\nperform a feat of which he might be proud as long as he lived? In the\r\nmidst of this cogitation, he heard before him the tramp of footsteps,\r\nand saw the glimmering of an animal that bounded towards him with rapid\r\npace.  Could this be the panther which had pursued him, and intercepted\r\nhis flight!  He levelled his piece in readiness for battle, and was\r\npreparing to pull trigger at the first fair sight, when he saw that,\r\ninstead of a panther, it was Mum--good faithful Mum, broken loose from\r\nhis confinement at home, and come in a moment of need to help his\r\nmaster.  What a relief!  Robert called him, patted him, hugged him, and\r\nthen said, \"Stop, Mum!  I’ll give you something to do directly.  Just\r\nwait a minute, boy, till I load this other barrel; and with you to help\r\nme, I shall not be afraid of any panther, whether his eyes are in or\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nMum had sagacity enough to know that his master was greatly excited, and\r\nhe showed his own sympathy by whining, frisking about, and wagging his\r\nshort tail. Robert loaded with dispatch, hurried back, keeping Mum\r\ndirectly before him, and holding his piece ready for instant use; but\r\nthe panther had disappeared.\r\n\r\nOn reaching the field of battle, Mum’s first act was to spring upon the\r\nprostrate bird, but finding it dead he let it lie; then perceiving the\r\nodour of the panther’s track, his hair bristled, he followed the trail\r\nfor a few steps, and returned, looking wistfully into his master’s face.\r\nHe evidently understood the dangerous character of the beast that had\r\nbeen there, and was reluctant to follow.  Robert, however, put him upon\r\nthe trail, and encouraged him to proceed.  Mum undertook the business\r\nvery warily.  He went first to the brier on which the panther had last\r\nbeen seen; then in a zigzag course, that seemed to be interrupted by\r\nevery bush against which the blinded beast had struck; finally he\r\nbristled up again, and gave signs of extreme caution.  A few steps\r\nbrought them to a fallen log, between two large branches of which Robert\r\nsaw his formidable enemy, crouched and panting.  He softly called in his\r\ndog.  The panther pricked up its ears, and raised its head, as if trying\r\nto pierce through the impenetrable gloom. Robert came noiselessly nearer\r\nand nearer, until within ten paces, then deliberately taking aim, he\r\ndischarged the whole load of bullets between the creature’s eyes. It\r\nleaped convulsively forward, and died almost without a struggle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Deliberately taking aim, he discharged the whole load of\r\nbullets between the creature’s eyes]\r\n\r\nSoon as it was indubitably dead, Robert went forward to examine it.  He\r\nturned it over, felt its bony legs and compact body; looked at the\r\nterrible fangs from which he had made so narrow an escape, and, having\r\nsatisfied his curiosity, attempted to take it upon his shoulder; but\r\nthis was far beyond his strength--the panther was heavy as a large deer.\r\nHe marked carefully the spot where it lay, and returning to the tree for\r\nhis book and bird, hurried home, to tell the others of his perilous\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\nHardly had he come within sight, before Frank’s quick eyes discerned\r\nhim.  \"What!\" said he, with a playful taunt, \"only one turkey!  I\r\nthought you would have had a house full, you staid so long and fired so\r\noften. Cousin Harold hardly knew what to make of it; he said he supposed\r\nyou must have _wounded_ a turkey; so I ran and let Mum loose to help\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am glad you did,\" replied Robert, drawing a long breath, \"for never\r\nin my life was I more in need of help.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you didn’t get the other after all?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, yes, all I aimed at.  But something came near getting me, too.\r\nWhere are Cousin Harold and sister?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the tent.\"\r\n\r\nHarold and Mary smiled with pleasure to see the fine bird on his\r\nshoulder, but could not understand the seriousness of countenance with\r\nwhich he approached. He related the particulars of his adventure, to\r\nwhich they listened with breathless attention.  Mary turned very pale,\r\nHarold’s eyes flashed fire, and Sam’s white teeth shone in repeated\r\nlaughs of admiration.\r\n\r\n\"How I wish I could have been with you,\" said Harold, looking mournfully\r\nat his lame foot.\r\n\r\n\"I wish you had been.\"\r\n\r\n\"That was a terrible moment, when you had fired your last barrel, and\r\nthe panther was rushing upon you. You must have given up all for lost.\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Robert, \"I felt myself tremendously excited, but had no\r\nidea of giving up.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is natural,\" said Harold.  \"No one ever gives up while there is\r\nanything to do.  But do tell me, what did you think of?  People can\r\nthink so fast, and so powerfully, when brought to the pinch, that I like\r\nto hear all about their plans and thoughts.  Tell me everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"From first to last,\" said Robert, smiling, \"I thought of many things,\r\nbut of none which I had time to execute, except to fire into his eyes,\r\nand club my gun.  I first thought of running away, but not until I had\r\nstood so long that the panther seemed about to spring upon me. Then the\r\nidea occurred to me of trying the power of my eye, as father recommended\r\nabout dogs; but I confess there was more power in his eye than mine, for\r\nI was badly frightened.  My next thought was to take off my cap and rush\r\nupon him, as if that was some deadly weapon.  I heard once of a lady in\r\nIndia, who saved herself and several others from a Bengal tiger, by\r\nrushing at him with an umbrella which she kept opening and shutting as\r\nshe ran.  There was another plan still, of a negro in Georgia, who\r\nfought and killed a panther with his knife.  But,\" he continued, \"let us\r\ntalk a moment of the carcass.  What shall I do with it; leave it there\r\nor bring it to the tent?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, bring it, bring it, by all means,\" Harold replied; \"I doubt not\r\nCousin Mary and Frank will help you.\"\r\n\r\nMary was not at all pleased with the prospect of such unladylike\r\nbusiness, and in consequence gave Harold a look of disapproval, which he\r\naffected not to see.  She went, nevertheless, and the panther was soon\r\nlying before the tent-door.  The rest of the forenoon was spent in\r\nflaying it, which they did with the claws, tail and ears attached; for\r\nRobert had remarked, that being compelled to imitate Hercules in\r\ndestroying wild beasts, he had a fancy to imitate him also in his couch.\r\nWhile thus engaged, Harold asked for the story of the negro.\r\n\r\n\"It is not much of a story,\" said Robert; \"I thought of it merely in\r\nconnection with the rest.  The negro was going to his wife’s house,\r\nwhich was some miles distant from the plantation, and which made it\r\nnecessary for him to pass through a dark, dismal swamp.  Usually he\r\npassed it by daylight, for it was infested by wild beasts; but being a\r\ndaring fellow, he sometimes went by night, armed only with a long sharp\r\nknife.  The last time he made the attempt he did not reach his wife’s\r\nhouse, and his master went in search of him.  Deep in the swamp he had\r\nmet with a panther, and had a terrible fight.  Traces of blood were\r\nplentiful, and deep tracks, where first one and then the other had made\r\nsome unusual effort.  Near at hand lay the panther, stabbed in nine\r\nplaces, and a little beyond lay the negro, torn almost to pieces.  They\r\nhad killed each other.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder,\" said Harold, \"that he did not carry a torch; no wild beast\r\nwill attack a person bearing fire.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure of that?\" Robert inquired.\r\n\r\n\"As sure as I can be, from having heard of it often, and tried it\r\ntwice.\"\r\n\r\nRobert begged for the particulars.\r\n\r\n\"I went with my father and two other gentlemen, on a hunting excursion\r\namong the mountains, where we camped out, of course.  One of the\r\ngentlemen having heard that there were plenty of wolves in that region,\r\nand wishing, as he said, to have some fun that night, had rubbed gum\r\nassafoetida upon the soles of his boots, before leaving the tent for it\r\nis said that wolves are attracted by the smell of this gum, and will\r\nfollow it to a great distance.  Now, whether it was the smell of the\r\nassafoetida or of our game, I will not pretend to say, but the wolves\r\ncame that night in such numbers that we could scarcely rest.  They\r\nhowled first on this side and then on that, and barked in such short\r\nquick notes, that one sounded like half a dozen.  Our horses were\r\nterribly frightened; we could scarcely keep them within bounds; and our\r\ndogs ran slinking into the tent with every sign of fear.  The only plan\r\nby which we could sleep with comfort was by building a large fire, and\r\nkeeping it burning all night.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did not the gentleman who was so fond of wolves go out after them?\"\r\nasked Robert.\r\n\r\n\"O, yes, we all went, again and again, but the cunning creatures kept in\r\nthe edge of the darkness, and when we approached on one side, they ran\r\nto the other.  It was there I heard the other gentleman, who was\r\nesteemed a great hunter, remark, that all wild beasts are afraid of\r\nfire.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wonder why?\"\r\n\r\n\"Night beasts are afraid I suppose, because they prowl in darkness; and\r\nas for the others, if they once feel the pain of fire they will be apt\r\nto keep out of its way.\"\r\n\r\n\"The other circumstance is this:--Last year I went on a night hunt, with\r\nsome boys of my own age; and not only did we meet with very poor\r\nsuccess, but for some hours were completely lost.  About an hour before\r\nday I left the company, and returned home; for I had promised my mother\r\nto return by twelve o’clock.  Before parting company, we heard a panther\r\nin the woods directly in my way, crying for all the world like a young\r\nchild.  The boys tried to frighten me out of my intention; but I told\r\nthem that if they would only let me have a good torch, I should safely\r\npass by a dozen panthers.  It was full two miles home.  The panther\r\ncontinued his cry until I came within a furlong, and then ceased.  As I\r\npassed the piece of woods from which his voice appeared to come, I heard\r\nafar off the stealthy tread of something retiring, and saw two large\r\neyes shining in the dark.  I have always supposed that these were the\r\neyes and tread of the panther, and that it was driven off by the torch.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nTURKEY-PEN--SUCKING WATER THROUGH OOZY SAND--EXPLORING TOUR--APPEARANCE\r\nOF THE COUNTRY--\"MADAME BRUIN\"--SOLDIER’S REMEDY FOR CHAFED FEET--NIGHT\r\nIN THE WOODS--PRAIRIE--INDIAN HUT--FRUIT TREES--SINGULAR SPRING\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be useless, and perhaps tedious, to trace thus day by day, and\r\nhour by hour, the history of our young friends.  We will now pass over\r\nan interval of nearly three weeks, from Saturday, November sixth, when\r\nRobert’s contest with the panther occurred, to Wednesday, November\r\ntwenty-fourth, when their affairs received another turn.\r\n\r\nThe only incident worth relating that occurred during this period, was\r\nthe construction of a pen for entrapping turkeys.  It was simply a\r\ncovered enclosure, of ten or twelve feet square, with a deep trench\r\ncommunicating from the outside to the centre.  This trench was made deep\r\nenough to allow a feeding turkey to walk under the side of the pen, and\r\nnext the wall, inside, it was bridged over, so that the birds in running\r\naround the enclosure, after having entered, might not fall into the\r\ntrench, and see their way out.  This trap is planned with a knowledge of\r\nthe fact, that though a turkey looks down when feeding, it never looks\r\ndown when trying to escape. This is equally true of the quail or\r\nsouthern partridge, and perhaps of most of the gallinaceous birds.  By\r\nmeans of this trap the boys took so many turkeys that they were at last\r\nweary of seeing them.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Harold’s ankle had become so nearly well, that for a\r\nweek it had been strong enough for all ordinary purposes; and Sam’s\r\nbones, though by no means fit to be used, were rapidly knitting, and\r\ngave promise of being all that broken bones can become in the course of\r\na few weeks.  No one had yet come to their rescue.  Often had they gone,\r\nsingly and together, to the flag-staff, and swept the watery horizon\r\nwith their glass, but no helper appeared, and no sign.  Robert and Mary\r\nhad learned by this time to curb their impatience, and to wait in\r\ncalmness the time when they should commence working upon their proposed\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nFrom the first day that they found themselves shut up upon the island,\r\nRobert and Harold had meditated an exploration of the surrounding\r\ncountry, but had hitherto been prevented by various causes.  Among these\r\nwas Mary’s excessive nervousness at the idea of being left alone, and\r\nparticularly so after Robert’s contest with the panther; but now she\r\nsaid, that with Fidelle to guard, and with Sam to shoot, exclusive of\r\nwhat she herself might do in case of an emergency, she gave her consent\r\nto the tour.\r\n\r\nThe stock of provision laid in by this time was quite respectable.  Five\r\ndeer had been killed, and their hams were now in the smoke, the company\r\nhaving in the meantime subsisted upon the other parts of the venison,\r\nturkeys from the pen, oysters, crabs, and fish.  There were also fifty\r\ndried fish, two live turkeys, and four fat \"pigs\" (so called) in the\r\ncage, to say nothing of the stores brought from home.  Before starting,\r\nthe boys provided Mary with a large supply of wood for the kitchen and\r\nsmoke-house, water also, and everything else which they could foresee as\r\nneedful.  They loaded the remaining guns with heavy shot, and laid them\r\naside ready for use; and, moreover, offered to build for her a palisade\r\naround the tent, by driving down stakes, and wattling them with grape\r\nvines; but to this last Mary objected, saying she was ashamed to be\r\nconsidered so great a coward.\r\n\r\nIt was broad daylight on the morning of Wednesday, the twenty-fourth day\r\nof November, when they set out upon their tour.  Robert carried the\r\nwallet of provision, consisting of parched corn, jerked venison, and a\r\nfew hard crackers of Mary’s manufacture; in his belt he fastened a flat\r\npowder flask filled with water, being the best substitute he could\r\ndevise for a canteen.  Harold carried the blanket rolled like a wallet,\r\nand Frank’s hatchet stuck in his belt.\r\n\r\nWilling to ascertain the coastwise dimensions of the island, and also\r\nthe approaches to it from sea, they directed their course along the hard\r\nsmooth beach, occasionally ascending the bluff for the purpose of\r\nobserving the adjacent country.  Their rate of travelling was at first\r\nintentionally slow, for they were both pedestrians enough to know that\r\nthe more slowly a journey is commenced, the more likely it is to be\r\ncomfortably continued.\r\n\r\nAt the end of six miles they plainly discerned the southern extremity of\r\nthe island, lying a mile beyond, and marked by a high bank of sand,\r\nthrown up in such profusion as almost to smother a group of dwarfish,\r\nill-formed cedars.  Beyond the bluff they saw the river setting eastward\r\nfrom the sea, and bordered on its further side with a dense growth of\r\nmangroves.  Satisfied with this discovery, and observing that, after\r\nproceeding inland for a few miles, the river bent suddenly to the north,\r\nthey turned their faces eastward, resolved to strike for some point upon\r\nthe bank.  The sterile soil of the beach, and its overhanging bluff,\r\nwhich was varied only by an occasional clump of cedars and a patch of\r\nprickly pears, with now and then a tall palmetto, that stood as a\r\ngigantic sentry over its pigmy companions, was exchanged as they receded\r\nfrom the coast, first for a thick undergrowth of low shrubs and a small\r\nvariety of oak, then for trees still larger, which were oftentimes\r\ncovered with vines, whose long festoons and pendant branches were loaded\r\nwith clusters of blue and purple grapes.  About midway of the island the\r\nsurface made a sudden ascent, assuming that peculiar character known as\r\n\"hammock,\" and which, to unpractised eyes, looks like a swamp upon an\r\nelevated ridge.\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the beach the boys had quenched their thirst at a spring\r\nof cool, fresh water, found by scratching in the sand at high water\r\nmark, but which they would not have been able to enjoy had it not been\r\nfor a simple device of Robert’s.  The sand was so soft and oozy, that\r\nbefore the basin they had excavated was sufficiently full to dish from,\r\nits sides had fallen in. Harold had tried at several places, but failing\r\nin all, he hallooed to Robert, whom he had left behind, to know what had\r\nbeen his success.\r\n\r\n\"Come and see,\" was the reply.  Harold went, but saw nothing.\r\n\r\n\"There is my spring,\" said Robert, pointing to the end of a reed like\r\nthat of a pipe-stem, sticking out of the sand.  \"Suck at that,\" he\r\ncontinued, \"and you will get all that you want.\"\r\n\r\nHarold tried it, and rose delighted.  \"Capital!\" he exclaimed; \"but how\r\ndo you keep the sand from rising with the water?\"\r\n\r\nRobert drew out the reed, and showed him a piece of cloth fastened as a\r\nstrainer on its lower end.  \"I have often thus quenched my thirst when\r\nfishing on our sandy beaches, and have never found it to fail.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is exceedingly simple,\" remarked Harold.  \"I wonder I never saw it\r\nnor heard of it before.\"\r\n\r\n\"So do I,\" rejoined Robert; \"and yet I question whether I should ever\r\nhave heard of it myself, had it not been for the Hottentots.\"\r\n\r\nHarold’s eyes opened wide at the mention of Hottentots, and Robert went\r\non to say, \"A year or two since, while reading an account of the\r\nsuffering of people in South Africa for the want of water, and their\r\nvarious devices for obtaining it, I was struck with the simplicity of\r\none of their plans.  On coming to a place where the water was near the\r\nsurface, but where they could not dig a well, they would make a narrow\r\nhole a yard or more deep, and insert a small reed having a bunch of\r\ngrass or moss tied around its lower end.  This reed they buried, all\r\nexcept a short end left above ground, and packed the earth tightly\r\naround it.  Then they sucked strongly at the open end, and it is said\r\nthat, if the earth was sufficiently moist and if the soil was not too\r\nclose, the water would soon run through the reed, cleansed of its mud\r\nand sand by passing through the rude filter attached to its lower end.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whoever may have been its author, it is an excellent device,\" said\r\nHarold.  \"I shall not forget it.\"\r\n\r\nAt noon the boys seated themselves under a heavy canopy of vines, and\r\nate their frugal dinner in sight of a luscious-looking dessert, hanging\r\nin purple clusters above and around them, which in its turn they did not\r\nfail to enjoy.\r\n\r\nResuming their journey to the east, they proceeded about a mile further,\r\nwhen Mum, who had trotted along with quite a philosophic air, as if\r\nknowing that his masters were intent upon something other than hunting,\r\nwas seen to dash forward a few steps, smell here and there intently,\r\nthen with a growl of warning to come beside them for protection.\r\n\r\n\"That is a panther, I’ll warrant,\" said Robert.  \"At least Mum acted\r\nexactly in that way the other day when I put him upon the panther’s\r\ntrack.  Had we not better avoid it?\"\r\n\r\n\"By no means,\" replied Harold.  \"Let us see what the creature is.  We\r\nare on an exploring tour, you know, and that includes animals as well as\r\ntrees.  A panther is a cowardly animal, unless it has very greatly the\r\nadvantage; and if you could conquer one with a single load of duck-shot\r\nwhen alone and surprised, surely we two can manage another.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Robert, \"but I assure you, my success was more from accident\r\nthan skill; and I would rather not try it again.  However, it will do no\r\nharm to push on cautiously, and see what sort of neighbours we have.\"\r\n\r\nThey patted their dog, and gave him a word of encouragement; the brave\r\nfellow looked up, as if to remonstrate against the dangerous\r\nundertaking, but on their persisting went cheerfully upon the trail; he\r\ntook good care, however, to move very slowly, and to keep but little in\r\nadvance of the guns.  The two boys walked abreast, keeping their pieces\r\nready for instant use, and proceeded thus for about fifteen minutes,\r\nwhen their dog came to a sudden halt, bristled from head to tail, and\r\nshowed his fangs with a fierce growl; while from a thicket, not ten\r\npaces distant, there issued a deep grumbling sound, expressive of\r\ndefiance and of deadly hate.  Harold stooped quickly behind the dog, and\r\nsaw an enormous she bear, accompanied by two cubs that were running\r\nbeyond her, while she turned to keep the pursuers at bay.\r\n\r\n\"We must be cautious, Robert,\" said Harold; \"a bear with cubs is not to\r\nbe trifled with.  We must either let her alone, or follow at a\r\nrespectful distance.  What shall we do?  She has a den somewhere near at\r\nhand, and no doubt is making for it.\"\r\n\r\nRobert was not very anxious for an acquaintance with so rough a\r\nneighbour, but before the fearless eye of his cousin every feeling of\r\ntrepidation subsided, and he was influenced only by curiosity, which, it\r\nis well known, becomes powerfully strong when spiced with adventure.\r\nThey followed, governing themselves by the cautious movements of their\r\ndog, and able to catch only a casual glimpse of the bear and her cubs,\r\nuntil they came within thirty paces of a poplar,[#] five feet in\r\ndiameter, with a hollow base, into which opened a hole large enough to\r\nadmit the fugitives.\r\n\r\n\r\n[#] Tulip tree (Liriodendron tulipifera), called poplar at the South.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"There, now, is the country residence of Madame Bruin,\" said Robert,\r\nstopping at a distance to reconnoitre the premises.  \"Shall we knock at\r\nher door, and ask how the family are?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think not,\" replied Harold, \"the old lady is rather cross sometimes,\r\nand I suspect from the tones of her voice she is not in the sweetest\r\nhumour at the present.  Take care, Robert, she is coming!  Climb that\r\nsapling!  Quick!  Quick!\"\r\n\r\nThe boys each clambered into a small tree, and as soon as they were well\r\nestablished, Harold remarked, \"Now let her come, if she loves shot.  A\r\nbear cannot climb a sapling.  Her arms are too stiff to grasp it; she\r\nneeds a tree large enough to fill her hug.\"\r\n\r\nBut Madame Bruin, like the rest of her kin, was a peaceable old lady,\r\nnot at all disposed to trouble those that let her alone, and on the\r\npresent occasion she had two sweet little cherubs, whose comfort\r\ndepended upon her safety; so she contented herself with going simply to\r\nher front door, and requesting her impertinent visitors to leave the\r\npremises.  This request was couched in language which, though not\r\nEnglish, nor remarkably polite, was perfectly intelligible.\r\n\r\n\"I suppose we shall have to go now,\" said Harold; \"it will not be civil\r\nto keep prying into the old lady’s chamber.  But when Sam is able to\r\njoin us, we can come prepared to make bacon of her and pets of her\r\ncubs.\"\r\n\r\nThey called off the dog, patted him in praise of his well-doing, and\r\nthen retreated, blazing the trees all the way from the poplar to the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nSeveral of these last miles Robert had walked with increasing\r\npainfulness; his feet were so much chafed as to be almost blistered.\r\n\r\n\"Stop, Harold, and let us rest here,\" he said, on reaching a fallen log.\r\n\"I wish to try that soldier’s remedy for chafed feet.\"\r\n\r\n\"What soldier’s?\" Harold inquired.\r\n\r\n\"One of those at Tampa,\" replied Robert.  \"I heard several of them\r\nrelate, one day, how much they had suffered in marching with blistered\r\nfeet, when one of the number remarked that whenever the signs of chafing\r\noccurred he had relieved himself by shifting his socks from one foot to\r\nthe other, or by turning them inside out.  Upon this another stated that\r\nhe was generally able to escape all chafing by rubbing the inside of his\r\nsocks with a little soap before setting out.  And another still added\r\nthat he had often _cured_ his blistered feet, in time for the next day’s\r\nmarch, by rubbing them with spirits mixed with tallow dropped from a\r\ncandle into the palm of his hand.  Before leaving home, today, I took\r\nthe precaution to soap the inside of my socks; but now I shall have to\r\ntry the efficacy of the other remedy; and sorry shall I be if there\r\nshould be need for the third plan, because we have neither the tallow\r\nnor the spirits necessary for the experiment.\"\r\n\r\nRobert gave the proposed plan a trial, and found, to his delight, that\r\nit saved him from all further discomfort.\r\n\r\nNothing more of interest occurred that day.  On leaving the river,\r\nwhich, after making a great sweep to the south-east, came so near the\r\nbank on which they stood, as to afford a good landing for boats, they\r\nturned into the woods and kept a northern course parallel with the\r\nshore.  About sunset they stopped beside a large log of resinous pine,\r\nwhich they selected for the place of their encampment that night,\r\nintending to set the log a-fire.  Around it they cleared an irregular\r\nring, which they fired on the inner side, thus providing a place for\r\ntheir sleeping free from insects, and from which fire could not escape\r\ninto the surrounding forest.  Next, they made themselves a tent of\r\nbushes, by bending down one sapling, fastening its top to the side of\r\nanother, and then piling against it a good supply of evergreens,\r\ninclined sufficiently to allow a narrow space beneath.  A neighbouring\r\ntree supplied them with moss for a superb woodland mattress, and while\r\nRobert was preparing that Harold collected a quantity of pine knots, to\r\nbe reserved in case their fire should decline.\r\n\r\nBy the time these preparations were completed darkness closed around.\r\nJupiter, at that time the evening star, glowed brightly from the western\r\nsky, while Orion, with his brilliant belt, gleamed cheerily from the\r\neast. The boys sat for some time luxuriating in their rest, listening to\r\nthe musical roar of their fire, and watching the red glare which lighted\r\nup the sombre arches of the forest; then uniting in their simple repast,\r\nand giving Mum his share, they lay down to sleep, having committed\r\nthemselves to the care of Him who slumbers not, and who is as near his\r\ntrustful worshippers in the forest as in the city.\r\n\r\nThere is a wild pleasure in sleeping in the deep dark woods.  The sense\r\nof solitude, the consciousness of exposure, the eternal rustle of the\r\nleafy canopy, or else its perfect stillness, broken only by the stealthy\r\ntread of some beast of night, or the melancholy hooting of a restless\r\nowl, give a variety which is not usual to civilized men, but which,\r\nbeing of a sombre character, requires for its enjoyment a bold heart and\r\na self-relying spirit.\r\n\r\nThe boys retired to rest soon after supper, and tried to sleep; but the\r\nnovelty of their circumstances kept them awake.  They rose from their\r\nmossy couch, sat by the fire, and talked of their past history and of\r\ntheir future prospects.  All around was perfect stillness.  Their voices\r\nsounded weak and childlike in that deep forest; and embosomed as they\r\nwere in an illuminated circle, beyond whose narrow boundary rose an\r\nimpenetrable wall of darkness, they felt as if they were but specks in\r\nthe midst of a vast and lonely world.\r\n\r\nAt last their nervous excitement passed away.  They retired once more to\r\nbed, having their guns within reach, and Mum lying at their feet.  The\r\nroar of the blaze and crackle of the wood composed them to sleep; and\r\nwhen they next awoke, daylight had spread far over the heavens, and the\r\nstars had faded from sight.  They sprang lightly to their feet, and\r\nbefore the sun appeared were once more on their way northward, along the\r\nbanks of the river.\r\n\r\nTheir march was now slow and toilsome.  In the interior a hammock of\r\nrich land, covered with lofty trees, matted with vines, and feathered\r\nwith tall grass, impeded their progress; while near the river bay-galls,\r\nstretching from the water’s edge to the hammocks, fringed with\r\ngall-berries, myrtles and saw-palmettoes, and crowded internally with\r\nbays, tupeloes, and majestic cypresses (whose singular looking \"knees\"\r\npeeped above the mud and water like a wilderness of conical stumps),\r\nforced them to the interior.  Their average rate of travel was scarcely\r\na mile to the hour.\r\n\r\nSeveral herds of deer darted before them as they passed, and once, while\r\nin the hammock, where the growth was very rank, they were almost within\r\narm’s length.\r\n\r\nAbout noon they emerged into an open space, which Harold pronounced to\r\nbe a small prairie; but in the act of stepping into it, rejoiced at a\r\ntemporary relief from the viny forest, he grasped the arm of his cousin,\r\nand drew him behind a bush, with a hurried,\r\n\r\n\"Back! back!  Look yonder!\"\r\n\r\nRobert gave one glance, and stepped back into concealment as quickly as\r\nif twenty panthers were guarding the prairie.  There stood an Indian\r\nhut.\r\n\r\nThe boys gazed at each other in dismay; their hearts beat hard, and\r\ntheir breath grew short.  Were there Indians then upon the island, and\r\nso near them?  What might not have happened to Mary and Frank?  But a\r\nclose scrutiny from their bushy cover enabled them to breathe freely.\r\nThere was a hut, but it was evidently untenanted; grass grew rank about\r\nthe doorway, and the roof was falling to decay.  It had been deserted\r\nfor years.\r\n\r\nThe boys went boldly to it, and entered.  Rain from the decayed and\r\nfalling roof had produced tufts of grass in the mud plaster of the\r\nwalls.  In the centre was a grave, banked with great neatness, and\r\nprotected by a beautifully arched pen of slender poles.  At the door was\r\na hominy mortar, made of a cypress block, slightly dished, and having a\r\nnarrow, funnel-shaped cavity in its centre.  Upon it, with one end\r\nresting in a crack of the wall, lay the pestle, shaped like a maul, and\r\nbearing the marks of use upon that end which white men would ordinarily\r\nregard as the handle.  Overhanging the house were three peach trees, and\r\naround it the ground was covered with a profusion of gourds of all\r\nsizes, from that which is used by many as a pocket powder-flask to that\r\nwhich would hold several gallons. Beyond the house, and on the edge of\r\nthe prairie, was a close growth of wild plums.\r\n\r\n\"This place,\" said Harold, musing, \"must have belonged to some old\r\nchief.  The common people do not live so comfortably.  It is likely that\r\nhe continued here after all others of his tribe had gone; and when he\r\ndied, his children buried him, and they also went away.  Poor fellow!\r\nhere he lies.  He owned a beautiful island, and we are his heirs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Peace to his ashes!\" ejaculated Robert.\r\n\r\nThey looked sadly upon the signs of ruin and desolation.  It always\r\nmakes one sad to look upon a spot where our kind have dwelt, and from\r\nwhich they have passed away; it is symbolic of ourselves, and the grief\r\nwe feel is a mourning over our own decay.\r\n\r\nIt was now twelve o’clock, and they began to feel the demands of\r\nappetite.  Harold proposed to search longer, in hope of finding a spring\r\nof fresh water.  \"I am sure,\" said he, \"there must be one hereabouts,\r\nand we shall find it exceedingly convenient in our frequent hunts.\"\r\n\r\nThey searched for nearly half an hour in vain; and as they were on the\r\npoint of giving up, Harold called out, \"I have found it!  Come here,\r\nRobert, and see what a beauty!\"  Robert hastened to the shallow ravine\r\nwhich terminated the eastern end of the prairie.  Not two steps below\r\nits green margin was a real curiosity of its kind--a rill of clear,\r\ncool-looking water, issuing from the hollow base of a large tupelo[#]\r\ntree.  It was a freak of nature, combining beauty, utility and\r\nconvenience.  The water was as sweet as it was clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n[#] The black gum of the swamps, having, like all trees that grow in\r\nwater, a spreading, and generally a hollow base.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving quenched their thirst at this beautiful fountain, and prepared to\r\nopen their wallet of provisions, Robert’s eye was attracted by a glimpse\r\nof a rich golden colour, on the edge of the prairie.  They went to it,\r\nand found several varieties of orange trees, bearing in great profusion,\r\nand among them were limes, whose delicate ovals asked only to be tried.\r\nBeneath these trees they dined, and afterwards plucked their fragrant\r\ndessert from the loaded branches.  Then they filled their pockets with\r\nthe different varieties, and started homewards.\r\n\r\nIt was scarcely a mile from these orange trees to the first that they\r\nhad discovered; and thence only three miles home.  They reached the tent\r\nlate in the afternoon. All were rejoiced to see them.  Frank made\r\nhimself merry, as usual, at their expense--laughing now that two hunters\r\nshould be absent two whole days, and bring back only a few wild oranges.\r\nMary said she had missed them very much, especially when night came on,\r\nbut that everything had been smooth and pleasant; she had seen no\r\npanthers, and had not even dreamed of any.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANS--VISIT TO THE PRAIRIE--DISCOVERIES--SHOE MAKING--WATERFOWL\r\n\r\n\r\nThe severe exercise of the two preceding days was more than Harold’s\r\nankle, in its state of partial recovery, could endure without injury.\r\nFor several days afterwards he was compelled to rest it from all\r\nunnecessary labour, and to relieve its pain by frequent and copious\r\napplications of cold water.\r\n\r\nSam’s wounded limbs were rapidly regaining strength, and he insisted\r\nthat they were well enough to be used; but Robert refused to indulge\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"We must risk nothing in the case,\" said he.  \"It is so important to\r\nhave you able to help us build our boat, that I think you had better\r\ncontinue in bed one week too long than leave it one day too soon.  You\r\nmust be content to rest your arm for full five weeks, and your leg for\r\nsix or seven.\"\r\n\r\nMary and Frank had listened with deep interest to the account which the\r\nboys gave of the old Indian settlement, with its open prairie, vine\r\ncovered forest, orange grove, and sparkling spring; and begged so\r\nearnestly for the privilege of accompanying them on their next visit,\r\nthat they gave their consent.  The only difficulty foreseen in the case,\r\nwas that of leaving Sam alone; but when this was made known to him, he\r\nremoved all objection by saying:\r\n\r\n\"Wuddah gwine hu’t me?[#]  Jes load one gun, and put um by my side.  I\r\ntake care o’ myself.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[#] What is going to hurt me?\r\n\r\n\r\nThe object of their visit was not one of mere enjoyment. They had waited\r\nfor deliverance until they were convinced that it was vain to rely upon\r\nanything except their own exertions.  It was now between five and six\r\nweeks since they had landed upon the island.  There had been some\r\nstrange fatality attending all the efforts that they were sure had been\r\nmade on their behalf, and now they must try to help themselves.\r\n\r\nThe exploration had resulted in the discovery of beautiful timber, of\r\nevery size, fit for boats, and near the water’s edge.  They well knew it\r\nwould be a herculean task for persons of their age and education, and\r\npossessed of so few tools, to dig out, from these trees, a boat large\r\nenough to carry them all home; but they were compelled to do this, or to\r\nremain where they were. Having consulted with Sam, upon whose judgment\r\nin matters of work they relied far more than on their own, they resolved\r\nto build not one large boat but two of moderate dimensions, which might\r\nif necessary be lashed firmly together; and for this purpose to select\r\nnear the water two cypresses of three feet diameter, which should be\r\nfelled as soon as possible.  Their visit to the prairie was for the\r\npurpose of selecting these trees, in the low ground near the river.\r\n\r\nThe four set out in fine spirits early on the morning of Tuesday,\r\nNovember 30th, and continued their walk direct and without incident to\r\nthe Indian hut. Notwithstanding the gloomy association of the solitary\r\ngrave inside the deserted house, Mary and Frank were captivated with the\r\nwild beauty of the scene.  The soft green grass of the prairie--the\r\nmagnificent wall of forest trees enclosing the peaceful plain--the peach\r\ntrees over the hut--the oranges and the limes glancing through their\r\ndark green leaves--and the bright bubbling spring that flowed so\r\nsingularly from its living curb--all combined to enchant them.  It was\r\nso delightful a contrast to the bare and sterile sand of their present\r\nencampment, that they plead at once for a removal there.  This, of\r\ncourse, had occurred to the minds of the others also; but there were two\r\nserious objections to it.  One was that here they would be out of sight\r\nof vessels passing at sea; and the other (which they kept to themselves)\r\nwas that here they should be more in danger from wild beasts.  They\r\nreplied that they also preferred the prairie, but that they could not\r\nremove until Sam was better able to travel.\r\n\r\nHaving enjoyed to their satisfaction the view of the hut and its\r\npremises, Harold took Frank, and, followed by Fidelle, went in one\r\ndirection, while Robert and Mary, with Mum, went in another, to search\r\nfor trees suitable in size and location for their boats.  In the course\r\nof an hour they returned, having marked a large number, and at the same\r\ntime having added to their knowledge of the resources of the island.\r\nHarold discovered a fine patch of Coontah or arrowroot, from which a\r\nbeautiful flour can be manufactured; and hard by a multitude of plants,\r\nwith soft velvet-like leaves, of three feet diameter, having a large\r\nbulbous root resembling a turnip, and which Robert pronounced to be the\r\ntanyah, a vegetable whose taste is somewhat like that of a mealy potato.\r\nThe other company went to the river, where Robert discovered an old boat\r\nlanding, on one side of which was a large oyster bank, and on the other\r\na deep eddy of the stream, in which trout and other fish were leaping\r\nabout a fallen tree.  Mary’s discovery was more pleasant than useful.\r\nIt was a bed of the fragrant calamus or sweet flag, from which she\r\ngathered a handful of roots, and washing them clean, brought them as a\r\npresent to the others.  Frank was quite chagrined to see that he had\r\ndiscovered nothing new or valuable, and he did not recover his\r\nequanimity for some minutes.  While the seniors lingered cheerfully\r\naround the remains of their dinner, discussing the merits of their\r\ndelightful island and the prospect of their return home, Mary suddenly\r\ninquired:\r\n\r\n\"But where is Frank?  I have not seen him for half an hour.\"\r\n\r\nNor had any one else; for, unsatisfied with only one orange allowed him\r\nfor dessert, while there were so many on the trees, and secretly hoping\r\nto find something valuable to announce, he had quietly slipped away, and\r\nhad stealthily climbed one of the orange trees, from which he plucked an\r\norange for each of his four pockets, then with Fidelle at his side he\r\nhad strolled a little farther into the forest, eating as he went.\r\n\r\nThe boys, startled by Mary’s question, sprang instantly to their feet,\r\nrealizing vividly the danger to which he was exposed from wild beasts,\r\nbut of which they had said nothing to him or to her.  Scarcely, however,\r\nhad their halloo sounded among the trees, than they saw him and his\r\nfaithful companion approaching leisurely through the small thicket of\r\nwild plums.\r\n\r\n\"You thoughtless little boy,\" said Robert, upbraidingly; \"why did you go\r\noff by yourself in these dangerous woods?  Did you not know they are\r\nfull of bears and panthers?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I didn’t,\" Frank replied.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I now tell you that they are,\" continued Robert, \"and that you\r\nmust never again go there unless one of us is with you.  But what took\r\nyou there this time?\"\r\n\r\n\"Humph,\" grunted Frank; \"don’t you suppose I want to find something new\r\nand good as well as the rest of you? and I have found it, too.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" said Harold; \"what is it, Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"You must all guess,\" he answered, looking very proud, \"all of you\r\nguess.  What is the best thing in the world?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will say,\" answered Mary, \"that one of the best things in the world\r\nis a little boy who always tries to do right.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it is no boy,\" Frank continued; \"it is something sweet.  Guess the\r\nsweetest thing in the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said Robert, inclined to amuse himself, \"that the sweetest\r\n_looking_ things in the world are those pretty little girls we used to\r\nmeet on King Street, in Charleston.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said Frank; \"it is neither boys nor girls, but something to\r\neat.  What is the sweetest thing in the world to eat?\"\r\n\r\n\"If we were in town,\" Harold replied, \"I should guess candy and\r\nsugar-plums; but, as we are in the wild woods, I guess honey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, that’s it,\" said Frank, triumphantly; \"I have found a bee-tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why do you think it is a bee-tree?\" asked Mary, incredulously.\r\n\r\n\"Because I saw the bees,\" he replied, in confident tones.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Frank,\" said Robert, laughing, \"the bees you saw may have their\r\nhives miles and miles away.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, they have not,\" Frank stoutly maintained.  \"I have seen them going\r\nand coming out of their own hole just as they do at home.\"\r\n\r\n\"That sounds very much as if Frank is right, after all,\" argued Harold;\r\n\"let us go and see for ourselves. But how came you to find the tree,\r\nFrank?\"\r\n\r\n\"While I was eating my orange,\" he replied, \"a bee lit on my hand, and\r\nbegan to suck the juice there.  I was not afraid of him, for I knew that\r\nhe would not sting me if I did not hurt him; and more than that, I\r\nalways love to look at bees.  Well, he sucked till he had got juice\r\nenough, then he flew right up into a tree a little way off, and went\r\ninto a hole.  While I was looking at that hole, I saw many other bees\r\ngoing in or coming out; and then I knew that it was a bee-tree, because\r\nI had heard Riley talk about them at Bellevue. And, Cousin Harold, did\r\nyou not put up some brimstone for taking bee-trees?\"\r\n\r\n\"That I did, my dear little cousin,\" answered Harold, pleased with this\r\nunexpected allusion.  \"I have no doubt, from what you say, that you have\r\nfound a real bee-tree; and, in that case, you have beat us all.  Take us\r\nto see it.\"\r\n\r\nThey all went in joyous mood, and sure enough there was a good sized\r\ntree, with a knot-hole about twenty feet above ground, with plenty of\r\nbees passing in and out of it.  The smell, too, of honey was decidedly\r\nstrong, showing that the hive was old and plentifully stored.\r\n\r\nIt may be as well to state here, as elsewhere, that before many days the\r\ntree was felled, and that it supplied them with such an abundance of\r\nhoney that a portion of it was, at Harold’s suggestion, stowed away in\r\nskin bags, hair side outward.  Some of it was beautifully white and\r\nclear.  This was kept in the comb.  The remainder was strained, and the\r\nwax was moulded into large cakes for future use.  The bees, poor\r\ncreatures! were all suffocated with the fumes of burning sulphur thrown\r\ninto the hollow of the tree before it was opened. A few recovered, and\r\nfor days hovered around their ruined home, until finally they all\r\nperished.  It made Frank’s kind heart very sad to see them, and several\r\ntimes he was stung while watching their movements and trying to help\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAfter spending a delightful day, they returned about sunset to the tent.\r\nSam’s white teeth glistened when they approached the door.  It had been\r\na lonely day with him, but their return compensated for his solitude.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forth the boys had before their minds a fixed object to\r\nbe accomplished--the felling of those trees, and converting them into\r\nboats.  But what should be the plan of their procedure while engaged in\r\nthe work?  They could go every morning, and return every evening--a\r\ndistance altogether of eight miles; or they could spend several nights\r\nin succession at the prairie, leaving Frank and Mary with Sam; or they\r\ncould remove everything to the place of their labour.  As to the first\r\ntwo of these plans, it was so manifestly improper to leave the two\r\nyounger ones for hours and days together, in a wild country, infested\r\nwith wild beasts, and unprotected, except by a lame, bedridden negro,\r\nwho was unable to protect himself, that they did not entertain them for\r\na moment.  It was finally resolved to delay their regular operations\r\nuntil the next week, by which time they hoped to be able, partly by\r\nwater and partly by land, to transport everything, and take up their\r\npermanent abode at the prairie.\r\n\r\nWith this conclusion, they set about those little preparations which\r\nthey could foresee as being necessary to an undivided use of their time\r\nafter entering upon their work.  Their clothes, and particularly their\r\nshoes, began to give signs of decay.  Frank’s shoes had for some time\r\nbeen gaping incontinently at the toes, looking for all the world, Sam\r\nsaid, as if they were laughing.\r\n\r\nHarold, foreseeing the necessity before it occurred, had put some\r\ndeer-skins in soak, wrapped up in lime made from burnt oyster shells;\r\nand after removing the hair loosened by this means, had stretched them\r\nin the sun, and softened them by frequent applications of suet. The\r\nskins were ready now for use; and as soon as it was determined to delay\r\ntheir visit to the prairie, he brought one of them to the tent, and\r\ncalling to Frank, said,\r\n\r\n\"Lend me your foot a minute, Master Frank, and I will give you a pair of\r\nmoccasins.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the _snakes_, I hope,\" replied Frank.\r\n\r\n\"No, but something of the same name,\" said Harold; \"I am going to turn\r\nshoemaker, and make you a pair of Indian shoes.  I need a pair myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so do I--and I!\" echoed Robert and Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, at this rate,\" said Harold, \"we may as well all turn\r\nshoemakers, and fit ourselves out in Indian style.\"\r\n\r\nHarold planted Frank’s foot upon the leather, which he drew up close\r\naround it, and marked at the heel, toe, and instep.  He then cut it\r\naccording to the measure, and there being but one short seam at the\r\nheel, and another from the toe to the instep, the sewing was soon\r\nfinished.  Frank tried it on, and for a first attempt the fit was very\r\ngood.  The fellow to this was barely completed, before two reports of\r\nRobert’s gun, following in quick succession, came lumbering down the\r\nriver. Fidelle pricked up her ears, and Harold, recalling vividly the\r\npanther scene, gave her the word to \"hie on,\" and seizing his own gun\r\nfollowed rapidly along the shore.  He had not proceeded far before a\r\nturn in the bluff revealed the figure of Robert, moving about the beach,\r\nand throwing at something in the water.  He saw, too, that when Fidelle\r\ncame up, Robert patted her, and pointing to the river, she plunged in\r\nand brought out a dark looking object, which she laid on a pile already\r\nat his feet.  Arriving at the spot, he saw six water-fowl, between the\r\nsize of a duck and a goose, of a kind entirely new to him, and which\r\nRobert assured him were brant.\r\n\r\n\"O Harold!\" Robert exclaimed, \"the shore was lined with them.  I crept\r\nbehind the bluff and killed four at my first shot, and three at my\r\nsecond, though one of them fell in the marsh and is lost.  A little\r\nfurther up was a large flock of mallards, feeding upon the acorns of the\r\nlive oak.  I could have killed even more of them than of these, but I\r\npreferred the brant.\"\r\n\r\n\"You startled me,\" said Harold; \"I did not know you had left the tent\r\nuntil I heard your gun, and then fearing you had got into another\r\npanther scrape, I dispatched Fidelle to your aid.\"\r\n\r\n\"She was exactly what I wanted, though I am thankful to say for a\r\npleasanter purpose.  See how fat these birds are!\"\r\n\r\nThey gathered up the game, and returned to the tent.  All were rejoiced\r\nat the new variety of provisions, for they had begun to weary of the\r\nold.  The brant proved quite as pleasant as Robert anticipated, and\r\nalternated occasionally with wild ducks, constituted for a long time an\r\nimportant addition to their stores.\r\n\r\nFor two days they were occupied with their new art of shoe making, and\r\nso expert did they become, that Harold said he doubted whether old\r\nTorgah himself could make much better moccasins than those manufactured\r\nby themselves.  There was one improvement, however, which they made upon\r\nthe usual Indian mode--a stout sole, made of several thicknesses of the\r\nfirmest part of the leather as a defence against thorns and cock-spurs,\r\nso abundant in the sandy soil of the coast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nREMOVAL TO THE PRAIRIE--NIGHT ROBBERY--FOLD--DANGEROUS TRAP--MYSTERIOUS\r\nSIGNALS--BITTER DISAPPOINTMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning, the wind blew so favourably up the river, that even\r\nbefore the tide began to rise, the young movers had loaded their raft,\r\nprepared a rude sail, and were ready to start.  The raft which had been\r\nconstructed for the purpose of rescuing Sam, had been originally so\r\nsmall, and the logs were now so thoroughly soaked with water, that to\r\nmake it carry what they wished at their first load they were compelled\r\nto add to its dimensions.  But this did not detain them long, and after\r\nall was completed, and the baggage stowed away, Sam, by the help of\r\nHarold’s crutches, hobbled to the beach, and seated himself at the helm,\r\nwhile Harold took the oars, and Robert, Mary and Frank went by their\r\nwell marked path through the woods, to meet them at the orange landing.\r\n\r\nThe passage by water occupied nearly three hours, and when the clumsy\r\nfloat slowly approached the shore, Harold could see through the narrow\r\nstrip of woodland, that Robert had felled two palmettoes on the edge of\r\nthe other river, and was now engaged in cutting them up.\r\n\r\n\"Can it be, Robert,\" he asked, on landing, \"that some bird of the air\r\nhas carried to you the message I wanted to send?  Are you not preparing\r\nanother raft?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am,\" he replied.  \"It occurred to me that if we could complete this\r\nraft by the turn of the tide, we might take the load to the _prairie\r\nlanding_, and yours might be floated hack to the old encampment for\r\nanother cargo.\"\r\n\r\nThe idea was so valuable, that the boys scarcely allowed themselves time\r\nto eat or to rest until it was accomplished; and when at last the tide\r\nwas seen moving towards the sea, they separated, Robert, Mary, and Sam\r\ngoing to the prairie landing, where they soon had the tent spread, and a\r\nfire burning; and Harold and Frank floating back to the place of their\r\nformer residence, where they secured the raft, and calling Nanny, Dora,\r\nand the kids, returned overland to join the company at the new home.\r\n\r\nFor several days they were occupied with the labour of transporting\r\ntheir baggage, and fitting up their present abode with comforts and\r\nconveniences.  The tent was not established at the landing where it was\r\npitched the first night, but on the edge of the prairie, a furlong\r\ndistant, and within a stone’s throw of the spring.\r\n\r\nOn the third night after their removal, they experienced a loss which\r\ncaused them to feel both sad and anxious.  Nanny and her kids, having no\r\nplace provided for them, had selected a nice retreat under the shelter\r\nof a mossy oak, and made that their lounging place by day, and their\r\nsleeping place by night.  At the time referred to the boys had just\r\nretired to bed, when they heard one of the kids bleating piteously, and\r\nits cry followed by the tramp of the others running to the tent for\r\nprotection.  Harold and Robert sprang to their guns, and calling the\r\ndogs, seized each a burning brand, and hurried in the direction of the\r\nkid, whose wail of pain and fear became every moment more faint, until\r\nit was lost in the distance.  The depredator was without doubt a\r\npanther.  Such a circumstance was calculated to dishearten the boys\r\nexceedingly; for it forewarned them that not only were they likely to\r\nlose all their pets, but that there was no safety to themselves, and\r\nparticularly none to Frank, if he should incautiously straggle into a\r\npanther’s way.  They called Nanny to a spot near the tent, fastened her\r\nby the dog’s chain to a bush, threw a supply of wood on the fire\r\nsufficient to burn for some hours, and retired to bed sad and uneasy.\r\nReturning from their unsuccessful sally, Harold significantly shook his\r\nhead, and said, \"I will be ready for him before he has time to be hungry\r\nagain.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no other disturbance that night.  Frank was asleep at the time\r\nof the accident, and knew nothing of it until the next morning, when\r\nseeing Nanny fastened near the tent, he asked why that was, and where\r\nwas the other kid.  \"Poor Jinny!\" he exclaimed, on hearing of its fate\r\n(the kids, being a male and female, had been called Paul and Virginia).\r\n\"Poor Jinny!  So you are gone!\"  He went to Nanny, the chief mourner,\r\nand patting her smooth side said, in a pitying tone, \"Poor Nanny!  Ain’t\r\nyou sorry for your daughter?  Only think, Nanny, that she is eaten up by\r\na panther!\"  Nanny looked sorrowful enough, and replied, \"Baa!\"  But\r\nwhether that meant, \"I am so sorry my daughter is dead,\" or, \"I wish you\r\nwould loose my chain, and let me eat some of this nice grass,\" Frank\r\ncould not determine. After a breakfast, by no means the most cheerful,\r\nHarold said,\r\n\r\n\"Robert, we must make a picket fence for the protection of these poor\r\nbrutes.  But as I have a particular reason for wishing some fresh\r\nvenison before night, I want to arrange matters so that either you or I\r\nshall go out early enough to be sure of obtaining it.\"\r\n\r\nRobert urged him to go at once, but disliking the appearance of avoiding\r\nlabour, he preferred to remain, and aid them through the most laborious\r\npart of the proposed work.  The palisade was made of strong stakes,\r\neight or ten feet long, sharpened at one end, and driven into a narrow\r\ntrench, which marked the dimensions of the enclosure.  Harold assisted\r\nto cut and transport to the spot the requisite number of stakes; and\r\nshortly after noon took Frank as his companion, and left Robert and Sam\r\nto complete the work.  He had not been gone more than an hour and a\r\nhalf, before Robert heard the distant report of a heavily loaded gun, in\r\nthe direction of the spot where the brant and ducks had been shot.\r\n\r\n\"Eh! eh!\" said Sam, \"Mas Harrol load he gun mighty hebby for a rifle!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Robert, \"and he has chosen a very poor weapon for shooting\r\nducks.\"\r\n\r\nThe workmen were too intently engaged to reflect that the report which\r\nthey heard could not have proceeded from a rifle.  In the course of half\r\nan hour another report, but of a sharper sound, was heard much nearer,\r\nand appearing to proceed from the neighbourhood of the orange-trees, on\r\nthe tongue of land.  Robert now looked inquiringly at Sam, and was about\r\nto remark, \"That gun cannot be Harold’s--it has not the crack of a\r\nrifle;\" but the doubt was only momentary, and soon passed away.  Long\r\nafterwards the familiar sound of Harold’s piece was heard in the west,\r\nand a little before sunset Harold and Frank appeared, bearing a fat\r\nyoung deer between them.\r\n\r\n\"That looks nice; but you have been unfortunate, Harold,\" said Robert,\r\nwho having finished the pen, and introduced into it Nanny and the two\r\nyoung ones, had wiped his brows, and sat down to rest.\r\n\r\n\"Why so?\"\r\n\r\n\"In getting no more.\"\r\n\r\nHarold looked surprised, but considering the remark as a sort of\r\ncompliment to his general character, returned,\r\n\r\n\"O, that must be expected sometimes.  But come, Robert, if you are not\r\ntoo weary, I shall be glad of your assistance in a little work before\r\ndark.  I wish to post up a notice here, that night robbers had better\r\nkeep away.\"\r\n\r\nBy their united efforts they succeeded in constructing a very simple\r\nthough dangerous trap, which Harold said he hoped would give them a dead\r\npanther before morning. He laid Riley’s rifle upon two forked stakes,\r\nabout a foot from the ground, and fastened it so that any movement\r\nforwards would bring the trigger against an immovable pin, and spring\r\nit.  He then tied a tempting piece of venison to a small pole, which was\r\nbound to the rifle in a range with the course of the ball.  And to make\r\nassurance doubly sure, he drove down a number of stakes around the bait,\r\nso that nothing could take hold of it, except in such direction as to\r\nreceive the load from the gun.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" said he, after having tried the working of his gun, by charging\r\nit simply with powder and pulling at the pole, as he supposed a wild\r\nbeast would pull at the bait, then loading it with ball and setting it\r\nready for deadly use--\"Now, if there is in these woods a panther that is\r\nweary of life, I advise him to visit this place to-night.\"\r\n\r\nThe dogs were tied up, and the work was done.  So long as the boys were\r\nengaged in making and setting their trap their minds were absorbed in\r\nits details, and they conversed about nothing else.  But when that was\r\nfinished, Harold referred to Robert’s remark about his hunting, and\r\nsaid, \"I was unfortunate, it is true, but it was only in going to the\r\nwrong place; for I got all that I shot at.  But what success had you,\r\nfor I heard your gun also.\"\r\n\r\n\"My gun!\" responded Robert, \"no, indeed.  I heard two guns up the river,\r\nand supposed you were trying your skill in shooting ducks with a rifle.\"\r\n\r\nHarold stopped, and stared at him in the dim twilight. \"Not your gun,\r\ndid you say?  Then did Sam go out?\"\r\n\r\n\"No.  He was working steadily with me, until a few minutes before you\r\nreturned.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys exchanged with each other looks of trouble and anxiety.  \"Did\r\nyou hear any gun in reply to mine?\" Harold asked.  Robert replied he had\r\nnot.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Harold, in a voice tremulous with emotion, \"I am afraid\r\nthat our worst trouble is to come; for either there are Indians on the\r\nisland, or our friends have come for us, and we have left no notice on\r\nour flag-staff to tell them where we are.\"\r\n\r\nRobert wrung his hands in agony.  \"O, what an oversight again! when we\r\nhad resolved so faithfully to give every signal we could devise.  I’ll\r\nget my gun! It may not be too late for an answer.\"\r\n\r\nHe ran with great agitation into the tent, and brought out his gun, but\r\nhesitated.  \"What if those we heard were fired by enemies, instead of\r\nfriends?\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case,\" replied Harold, \"we must run our risk.  If those were\r\nIndian guns, it will be vain to attempt concealment.  They have already\r\nseen our traces; and if they are bent on mischief, we shall feel it.\r\nLet us give the signal.\"\r\n\r\nThey fired gun after gun, charging them with powder only, and hearing\r\nthe echoes reverberate far away in the surrounding forest; but no sound\r\nexcept echoes returned. The person who fired those mysterious guns had\r\neither left the island, or was indisposed to reply.\r\n\r\nMany were the speculations they now interchanged upon the subject, and\r\ngravely did the two elder boys hint to each other, in language\r\nintelligible only to themselves, that there was now more to fear than to\r\nhope. They ate their supper in silence, and Mary and Frank went\r\nsorrowfully to bed.  Robert, Harold and Sam sat up late, after the\r\nlights were extinguished, watching for the dreaded approach of Indians,\r\nand devising various plans in case of attack.  At last they also\r\nretired, taking turns to keep guard during the whole night.  All was\r\nquiet until near morning; when, in the midst of Sam’s watch, they were\r\naroused by hearing near at hand the sharp report of a rifle.  In an\r\ninstant the excited boys were on their feet, and standing beside their\r\nsentry, guns in hand, prepared to repel what they supposed to be an\r\nIndian attack.  But Sam sung out in gleeful tone:\r\n\r\n\"No Injin! no Injin! but de trap.  Only yerry[#] how he growl!  I tell\r\nyou he got de lead!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[#] Yerry, hear.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boys hastily kindled a torch, loosed the dogs, ran to the trap, and\r\nfound, not a panther indeed, but a large wild cat, rolling and growling\r\nin mortal agony. The dogs sprang fiercely upon it, and in less than two\r\nminutes it lay silent and motionless, its keen eye quenched, and its\r\nonce spasmed limbs now softly flexible in death.  They took it up.  It\r\nwas nearly as large as Mum, being quite as tall, though not so heavy.\r\nBefore they had ceased their examinations the grey streak of dawn\r\ngleamed above the eastern woods, and instead of retiring to rest again,\r\nas their weariness strongly prompted, they prepared for the duties of\r\nthe opening day.\r\n\r\nThese duties appeared to be so contradictory, that they scarcely knew\r\nwhat plan to pursue.  It was clear that some one or more should go\r\nwithout delay to the coast, to ascertain whether their friends were or\r\nhad been there.  But who should go, and who should stay?  If there were\r\nIndians abroad, it would be dangerous to divide their little force; and\r\nyet all could not go, for Sam was lame.  Harold offered to go alone; but\r\nthe others, burning with the hope that their father might yet be on the\r\nisland, or within sight, insisted on bearing him company.  Sam also\r\nhelped to settle the question, by saying:\r\n\r\n\"Go, Mas Robbut, and little Missus, and Mas Frank; go all o’ you.  Don’t\r\nbe ’fraid for me; s’pose Injin come, he nebber trouble nigger.\"\r\n\r\nThis remark was based upon the well known fact that Indians seldom\r\ninterfere with negroes.  And encouraged thus to leave him a second time\r\nalone, the young people resolved to go in a body to the coast; agreeing\r\nwith him, however, that if he saw any danger he should give them timely\r\nwarning by setting on fire a fallen pine-top.\r\n\r\nCarrying what arms they could, and sending their dogs on either side as\r\nscouts, they walked swiftly along their well known path to the seacoast.\r\nNo accident happened, no sign of danger appeared; everything was as\r\nusual on the way, and at the place of their old encampment.  But\r\nscarcely had they reached the oak, before Harold, pointing to the earth,\r\nsoftened by a rain two nights before, cried out:\r\n\r\n\"Look here, Robert!  The tracks of two persons wearing shoes!\"\r\n\r\nRobert’s unpractised eye would never have detected the signs which\r\nHarold’s Indian tuition enabled him so readily to discover; he could\r\nscarcely distinguish, after the closest scrutiny, more than the deep\r\nindentation of a boot-heel.  But that was enough; a boot-heel proved the\r\npresence of a boot, and a boot proved the presence of a white man.  That\r\none fact relieved them from all apprehension that the visitors were\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nThey fired their guns, to attract if possible the attention of the\r\nstrangers; giving volley after volley, in repeated succession, and\r\nscanning the coast in every direction; but it was without the desired\r\nresult--the persons were gone.  Their dogs had by this time gone to a\r\nspot near the bluff, where there had been a fire, and were engaged in\r\neating what the boys discovered, on inspection, to be a ham-bone and\r\nscattered crumbs of bread. On descending the bluff, where footprints\r\nwere sharply defined in the yielding sand, Frank exclaimed:\r\n\r\n\"Here is _William’s_ track!  I know it--I know it is William’s!\"\r\n\r\nThe others examined it, and asked how he knew it was William’s.\r\n\r\n\"I know it,\" said he, \"by that W.  When father gave him that pair of\r\nthick boots for bad weather, William drove a great many tacks into the\r\nsole; and when I asked him why he did so, he said it was to make them\r\nlast longer, and also to know them again if they should be stolen, for\r\nthere was his name.  In the middle of one sole he drove nine tacks,\r\nmaking that W., and in the other he drove seven, so as to make an H.;\r\nfor he said his name was William Harper.  Yes, look here,\" pointing to\r\nthe other track, \"here is the H., too.\"\r\n\r\nThere was now not the shadow of a doubt that the track thus ingeniously\r\nidentified was William’s.  Then whose was that other, formed by a light,\r\nwell shaped boot?  Every heart responded.  The elder boys looked on with\r\nagitated faces; Mary burst into tears, and Frank, casting himself\r\npassionately down, laid his wet cheek upon that loved foot-print, and\r\nkissed it.\r\n\r\nBut he was gone now--though he had been so near--gone without a word, or\r\na sign, to say that he was coming back.  Gone?  Perhaps not.  Perhaps a\r\nsmoke might recall him, if the guns did not.  Harold silently ascended\r\nthe bluff, and with one of Frank’s matches fired the grass placed\r\nbeneath the heap of wood near the flag-staff.  The smoke rose; it\r\nattracted the attention of the others, and soon they heard Harold call\r\nfrom a distance, \"Come here, all of you!  Here is something more.\"\r\n\r\nThey ran together, Robert and Mary taking each a hand of Frank; and when\r\nthey reached the flag-staff, saw a paper fastened to it by wooden pins\r\ndriven into the bark, and on the paper, written in large round\r\ncharacters:\r\n\r\n                    \"_Five Thousand Dollars Reward_\r\n\r\n\"Will be cheerfully paid to any one who shall restore to me in safety a\r\nboat’s company, lost from Tampa Bay on the 26th of October last.  They\r\nwere dragged to sea by a devil-fish, and when last seen were near this\r\nisland. The company consisted of my nephew, Harold McIntosh, aged nearly\r\nfifteen, having black hair and eyes; and my three children, Robert\r\nGordon, aged fourteen; Mary Gordon, aged eleven; and Frank Gordon, aged\r\nseven years; all having light hair and blue eyes.\r\n\r\n\"The above reward will be paid for the aforesaid company, with their\r\nboat and boat’s furniture; or one thousand dollars for any one of the\r\npersons, or for such information as shall enable me to know certainly\r\nwhat has become of them.\r\n\r\n\"Information may be sent to me at Tampa Bay, care of Major ----,\r\ncommanding officer; or to Messrs. ---- & Co., Charleston, S. C.; or to\r\nR. H----, Esquire, Savannah, Georgia.\r\n\r\n\"Dec. 9, 1830.\r\n\"CHARLES GORDON, M.D.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nUnderneath was the following postscript in pencil:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"P.S.  The aforesaid company have evidently been upon this island within\r\nten days past.  I have searched the coast and country here in almost\r\nevery direction. They appear to have left, and I trust for home.  Should\r\nany fatality attend their voyage, they will probably be heard of between\r\nthis island and Tampa Bay.  C. G.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe young people were overwhelmed.  \"Poor father!\" Mary said with a\r\nchoking voice, \"how disappointed he will be when he reaches home, and\r\nfinds that we are not there!  And poor mother! if she is there I know it\r\nwill almost kill her.\"\r\n\r\n\"But father _will_ come again--he will come right back--I know he will,\"\r\nFrank murmured resolutely through his tears.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, if mother is not too sick to be left,\" conjectured Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Come, children,\" said Robert, with an air of sullen resolve, \"it is of\r\nno use to stand here idle.  Let us go back to the prairie, and build our\r\nboats.\"\r\n\r\n\"But not before we have left word on the flag-staff to tell where we are\r\nto be found,\" Harold added.  A bitter smile played around the corners of\r\nRobert’s mouth, as muttering something about \"locking the door after the\r\nsteed is stolen,\" he took out his pencil, and wrote in deep black\r\nletters,\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The lost company, together with Sam, a servant, are to be found at a\r\nsmall prairie three or four miles south-east from this point.  We have\r\nlost our boat, and are building another.\r\n\r\n\"Dec. 10, 1830.  ROBERT GORDON.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThey collected another pile of wood and grass for a fire signal near\r\ntheir flag-staff, and then with slow, sad steps, turned their faces once\r\nmore to the prairie.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n\r\nBEST CURE FOR UNAVAILING SORROW--MARY’S ADVENTURE WITH A BEAR--NOVEL\r\nDEFENCE--PROTECTING THE TENT\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was natural that the youthful company should be much cast down by\r\nthis misfortune.  But recent experiences had taught them many valuable\r\nlessons, and had caused them to practise, more fully than they would\r\nhave otherwise, those wise maxims which had formed no small part of\r\ntheir education.  While Robert and Mary were yet anguished with their\r\nsense of disappointment, Harold cheerfully remarked:\r\n\r\n\"I have often heard your father say, ’There are two kinds of ill that it\r\nis worth no wise man’s while to fret about:--Ills that _can be_ helped,\r\nfor then why do we not help them? and, Ills that _cannot be_ helped, for\r\nthen what is the use of fretting?’  I have also heard him say that ’_the\r\nbest cure for ills that cannot be helped is to set about doing something\r\nuseful_.’\"\r\n\r\n\"But what can we do more than we have already tried to do?\" asked\r\nRobert, in a questioning tone.\r\n\r\n\"Not much, I confess,\" was Harold’s reply; \"yet we can be on the lookout\r\nfor something.  Yes,\" he continued, pointing, as they walked, to one of\r\nthe turkey pens which they had not visited for several days, \"there is\r\nsomething now.  Very likely that trap has caught, and possibly the poor\r\ncreature that is in it, is now suffering more in body for want of food\r\nand water, than we are in mind.  Let us go and see.\"\r\n\r\nThey turned aside accordingly, and found within the trap a fine young\r\nhen in a half-famished condition.  She scarcely noticed them until they\r\nwere within a few paces of her, and then ran with feeble steps around\r\nthe pen, twitting mournfully, but without strength to fly. Robert\r\nproposed to let her go, saying that there would be no use in carrying\r\nhome a starved bird; but to this Mary objected.  She was beginning to\r\nbelieve with Harold that they were destined to stay a long time on the\r\nisland.  \"I think,\" said she, \"we had better take her home, and make a\r\ncoop for her, and let her be the beginning of a stock of poultry.  We\r\ncan get some ducks, too, I have no doubt, and that will be so nice.\"\r\n\r\nThe picture which she drew was so comfortable and pleasant, that they\r\nagreed to put it into instant execution.  They would make for her not a\r\ncoop merely, but a poultry yard and house, and stock it for her with\r\nturkeys, ducks, and brant; and she and Frank should feed them every\r\nmorning on acorns and chopped venison, and then they would live like\r\nprinces.  The only particular difficulty that suggested itself in the\r\ncase was, that wild turkeys cannot be tamed.  There is such an innate\r\nlove of freedom in their very blood, that even those which are raised\r\nfrom the egg by tame hens will soon forsake the yard for the forest.\r\n\r\nThese little pleasant plans (for after all it is _little things_ that\r\nmake life pleasant or unpleasant), occupied their minds, and soon\r\nemployed their hands; for immediately on their return home they\r\ncommenced upon Mary’s poultry house, and marked out also the limits of\r\nthe adjoining yard.  This occupied them for the two remaining days of\r\nthat week, and it was not until the Monday following that they commenced\r\nworking upon their boats.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of that week, however, another incident occurred, which\r\nthreatened to be fearful enough in its consequences, and caused another\r\ninterruption to their work.  Robert, Harold, and Sam, were engaged upon\r\nthe fallen tree; Mary was preparing their dinner, and Frank, having\r\nfound a large beetle, was employed in driving down sticks into the\r\nground, on the plan of the picket fence, \"making,\" as he professed, \"a\r\nhouse for his turkey.\"  He had begun to feel hungry; and as the odour of\r\nthe broiling venison floated to his olfactories, he suddenly became\r\nravenous.  He left his beetle half penned, and was on his way to ask his\r\nsister for a mouthful or two before dinner, when directly behind the\r\ntent he saw a great black object approaching the spot where Mary stood.\r\n\r\nHe looked a moment, uncertain what it could be, then gave a scream.\r\n\"Run, sister! run!\" he said.  \"Come here!  Look! look!\"  She looked, but\r\nsaw nothing, for the tent intervened.  As Frank said \"run!\" he set the\r\nexample, and reaching a small tree about six inches in diameter, climbed\r\nit as nimbly as a squirrel, crying as he ran, \"Come here!  Come here!\"\r\n\r\nMary was astonished.  She was sure from the tones of his voice that he\r\nwas in earnest, yet she saw no danger, and hesitated what to do.\r\nObserving him, however, climb the tree, calling earnestly to her, she\r\nwas about to follow, when in a moment it was too late.  An enormous bear\r\ncame from behind the tent, snuffing the odour of the meat, and looking\r\nvery hungry.  Almost as soon as it discovered her, it rose upon its hind\r\nlegs, seeming surprised to meet a human being, and came forward with a\r\nheavy growl.  Had any one been present to help, Mary would probably have\r\nscreamed and fainted, but thrown upon her own resources she ran to the\r\nfire and seized a burning brand.  Then another and very fortunate\r\nthought came to her mind.  The dipper, or water ladle, was in her hand;\r\nand as she drew the brand from the fire, she dipped a ladle full of the\r\nboiling, greasy water, and threw it into the breast, and upon the\r\nfore-paws of the growling beast.\r\n\r\nThat expedient saved her life.  The bear instantly dropped upon all\r\nfours, and began most piteously to whine and lick its scalded paws.\r\nMary seeing the success of her experiment, dipped another ladle full,\r\nand threw it in its face.  The bear now uttered a perfect yell of pain,\r\nand turning upon its hind legs, ran galloping past the tent, as if\r\nexpecting every moment to feel another supply of the hot stuff upon its\r\nback.\r\n\r\nAll this time Frank was calling from his tree, \"Come here, sister!  He\r\ncan’t get you here!  Come! come!\"  And Mary was about to go; but the\r\nbear was no sooner out of sight, than she felt very sick.  Beckoning\r\nFrank to come to her, she ran towards the tent, intending to fire off\r\none of the guns, as a signal for the large boys to return; but ere\r\nreaching the door her sight failed, her brain reeled, and she fell\r\nprostrate upon the earth. Frank looked all round, and seeing that the\r\nbear was \"clear gone,\" sprang lightly from the tree, and ran to her\r\nassistance.  He had once before seen her in a fainting fit, and\r\nrecollecting that Robert had poured water in her face, and set him to\r\nfanning her, and chafing her temples and the palms of her hands, he\r\nfirst poured a dipper full of cold water on her face, then seizing the\r\nconch, blew the signal of alarm, till the woods rang again.\r\n\r\nThis soon brought the others.  Harold came rushing into the tent, and by\r\nthe time that Robert arrived, he had loosened Mary’s dress, and was\r\nrubbing her hands and wrists, while Frank fanned her, and told the tale\r\nof her fighting the bear with hot water.  The boys were powerfully\r\nexcited.  Harold’s eye turned continually to the woods, and he called\r\nMum, and patted him with one hand, while he helped Mary with the other.\r\n\r\n\"Let me attend to her now,\" said Robert.  \"I see by your eye that you\r\nwish to go.  But if you will only wait a minute, I think sister will be\r\nsufficiently well for me to go with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am well enough now,\" she faintly replied.  \"You need not stay on my\r\naccount.  Do kill him.  He can’t be far away.  Oh, the horrible\"--she\r\ncovered her eyes with both hands, and shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"But will you not be afraid to have us leave you?\" asked Robert.\r\n\r\n\"No, no; not if you go to kill that terrible creature. Do go, before he\r\ngets away.\"\r\n\r\nSam had in the meantime hobbled in, and the boys needed no other\r\nencouragement.  Frank showed them the direction taken by the bear, and\r\nthey set out instantly in pursuit.  Mum had already been smelling\r\naround, and exhibiting signs of rage.  Now he started off on a brisk\r\ntrot.  They followed him to a moist, mossy place, where the bear\r\nappeared to have rolled on the damp ground, and drawn the wet moss\r\naround it to alleviate the pain of the fire; then to another low place,\r\nwhere he showed by his increasing excitement that the game was near at\r\nhand. Indeed, they could hear every minute a half whine, half growl,\r\nwhich proved that the troubled beast was there in great pain, and\r\nconscious of their approach.  But it did not long remain.  Seeming to\r\nknow that it had brought upon itself a terrible retribution, by\r\nattacking the quiet settlement, it broke from the cover, and ran to a\r\nlarge oak, in the edge of the neighbouring hammock, and when the boys\r\narrived, they found it climbing painfully, a few feet above ground.  Its\r\nhuge paws convulsively grasped the trunk, and it made desperate efforts\r\nto ascend, as if confident that climbing that tree was its only refuge,\r\nand yet finding this to fail it in its time of need. Both boys prepared\r\nto shoot, but Harold beckoned to Robert.\r\n\r\n\"Let me try him in the ear with a rifle ball, while you keep your\r\nbarrels ready in case he is not killed.\"\r\n\r\nHe advanced within ten paces, rested his rifle deliberately against a\r\ntree, took aim without the quivering of a muscle.  Robert saw him draw a\r\n\"bead sight\" on his victim, and knew that its fate was sealed.  There\r\nwas a flash, a sharp report, and the heavy creature fell to the earth,\r\nlike a bag of sand, and the dark blood, oozing from ears and nose,\r\nproved that its sufferings and its depredations were ended for ever.\r\n\r\n\"He will give us plenty of fresh pork, the monster!\" said Harold,\r\nendeavouring to quell his emotions, by taking a utilitarian view of the\r\ncase, and, in consequence, making a singular medley of remarks, \"What\r\nclaws and teeth!  I don’t wonder that Mary fainted!  She is a brave\r\ngirl!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, indeed,\" replied Robert; \"there is not one girl in a thousand that\r\ncould have stood her ground so well. And that notion of fighting with\r\nhot water--ha! ha!  I must ask where she got it.  It is capital.  Only\r\nsee here, Harold, how this fellow’s foot is scalded; this is the secret\r\nof his climbing so badly.\"\r\n\r\nMary’s hot water had done its work effectually.  The bear was terribly\r\nscalded on its paws, breast, face, and back of its head.  The boys bled\r\nit, as they did their other game, by cutting through the jugular vein\r\nand carotid artery; but wishing to relieve Mary’s mind as soon as\r\npossible, they returned to inform her that her enemy was dead.\r\n\r\n\"And pray tell me, sister,\" said Robert merrily, after recounting the\r\nscene just described, \"where did you learn your new art of fighting\r\nbears?\"\r\n\r\n\"From cousin Harold,\" she replied.\r\n\r\n\"From me, cousin!\" Harold repeated.  \"Why, I never heard of such a thing\r\nin my life.  How _could_ I have told you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You said one day,\" Mary continued, \"that wild beasts are afraid of\r\nfire, and that they cannot endure the pain of a burn.  Now when I took\r\nup the brand to defend myself, according to your rule, I remembered that\r\n_hot water_ hurts the most, and that moreover I could _throw_ it.  But\r\nif you had not mentioned the one, I should not have thought of the\r\nother.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think you deserve a patent,\" said Harold, patting her pale cheek.\r\n\"You have beat the whole of us, not excepting Robert, who was a perfect\r\nhero in his day; for he conquered a panther with duck-shot, but you have\r\nconquered a bear with a ladle.  Why, cousin Mary, if ever we return to a\r\ncivilized country we shall have to publish you for a heroine.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled at these compliments, but remarked that she was not heroine\r\nenough to covet another such trial; for that she was a coward after all.\r\n\r\n\"And you, Master Frank,\" said Robert, whose pleasurable feeling excited\r\na disposition to teaze, \"you climbed into a tree.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I did,\" replied Frank, \"as fast as I could, and tried to get\r\nsister Mary there too.  But she would stay and fight the bear with hot\r\nwater.  Sister, why did you not come?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did not know why you called,\" she answered.  \"I did not see anything,\r\nand did not know which way to run.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think, cousin,\" remarked Harold, \"that if you had run when Frank\r\ncalled, you would have saved yourself the battle.  The bear was after\r\nyour meat, not after you; and if you had only been willing to give up\r\nthat dinner, which you defended so stoutly, he would probably have eaten\r\nit, and let you alone.\"\r\n\r\nWith this lively chatting, Mary was so much cheered, that she joined\r\nthem at dinner, and partook slightly of the choice bits that her brother\r\nand cousin pressed upon her.  The afternoon was spent in preparing the\r\nflesh of their game.  They treated it in every respect as they would\r\npork, except that the animal was flayed; and they found the flesh well\r\nflavoured and pleasant.  The parings and other fatty parts were by\r\nrequest turned over to Sam, who prepared from them a soft and useful\r\ngrease. The skin was stretched in the sun to dry, after which it was\r\nsoaked in water, cleansed of all impurities, and rubbed well with salt\r\nand saltpetre (William had put up a quantity), and finally with the\r\nbear’s own grease. After it had been nicely cured, Harold made a present\r\nof it to Mary, who used it as a mattress so long as she lived upon the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nWarned so impressively to protect their habitation against wild beasts,\r\nthe boys spent the rest of the week in erecting a suitable enclosure.\r\nThey planted a double row of stakes around the tent and kitchen, filling\r\nup the interstices with twigs and short poles.  The fence was higher\r\nthan their heads, and there was a rustic gateway so contrived that at a\r\nlittle distance it looked like part of the fence itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nHARD WORK--LABOUR-SAVING DEVICE--DISCOVERY AS TO THE TIME OF THE\r\nYEAR--SCHEMES FOR AMUSEMENT--TIDES ON THE FLORIDA COAST\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a fortnight the boys worked very hard, and yet made but little\r\napparent progress.  Previous to this, they had devoted two days to\r\nMary’s convenience, and three more to her protection.  The rest had been\r\nspent in hacking, with dull axes, upon an immense tree.  The log was\r\nthree feet in diameter, and had been rough shaped into the general form\r\nof a boat, eighteen feet long.  But having no adze, nor mattock, which\r\nmight be used in digging, and receiving from Sam very little assistance\r\nmore than the benefit of his advice, they began to feel somewhat\r\ndiscouraged at the small results of their unpractised labours.  This\r\ncaused them to cast in their minds for some device by which their work\r\nmight be facilitated, and thankful enough were they to Indian ingenuity\r\nfor suggesting the plan by fire.  They set small logs of pine along the\r\nintended excavation, and guarding the edges with clay, to prevent the\r\nfire from extending beyond the prescribed limits, had the satisfaction\r\nto see, the next morning, that the work accomplished by this new agent\r\nduring the night, was quite as great as that accomplished by themselves\r\nduring the day.\r\n\r\nFor a few days they had been working under the pleasing stimulation\r\nproduced by this discovery, when Robert, pausing in the midst of his\r\nwork, said,\r\n\r\n\"Harold, have you any idea what day of the month this is?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Harold, \"I know that it is Friday, and that we are\r\nsomewhere past the middle of December. But why do you ask?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because, if I am not mistaken, tomorrow is Christmas day.  This is the\r\ntwenty-fourth of December.\"\r\n\r\nThe announcement made Sam start.  He looked at Robert with a half\r\nbewildered, half joyful gaze.  The very name of Christmas brought the\r\nfire to his eye.\r\n\r\n\"Ki, Mas Robbut,\" said he, \"you tink I remember Christmas?  Who ebber\r\nhear o’ nigger forget Christmas befo’?  But for sure, I nebber say\r\nChristmas to myself once, since I been come to dis island.  Eh! eh!  I\r\nwonder if ee ent[#] ’cause dis Injin country, whey dey nebber hab no\r\nChristmas at all?  Eh!  Christmas? Tomorrow Christmas?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[#] If it is not.\r\n\r\n\r\nRobert could have predicted the effect which his discovery would have\r\nupon Sam, but he was excessively amused to observe how unforgiving he\r\nseemed to be to himself for neglecting this part of a negro’s privilege.\r\nAs soon as it was settled, by a brief calculation, that the next day was\r\nindeed the twenty-fifth of December, another thing was settled, of\r\ncourse--that no work should be done, and that the day should be spent in\r\nenjoyment. Sam clapped his hands, and would have been guilty of some\r\nantic on the occasion, if his lame leg had not admonished him to be\r\ncareful.  So he only tossed his cap into the air, and shouted,\r\n\r\n\"Merry Christmas to ebbery body here, at Bellevue and at home!\"\r\n\r\n\"Now comes another question,\" said Robert; \"how shall the day be spent?\r\nWe have no neighbours to visit. No Christmas trees grow here, and Frank\r\nmay hang up his moccasins in vain, for I doubt whether Santa Claus ever\r\nheard of this island.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, yes, Mas Robbut,\" Sam merrily interposed. \"Dere is one neighbour I\r\nbeen want to see for long time. I hear say I got a countryman[#] libbin\r\nway yonder in a hollow tree.  He is a black nigger, ’sept he is got four\r\nlegs and a mighty ugly face.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[#] Pronounced long, country ma-an.  It usually means a native African.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"What does the fellow mean?\" said Harold, seriously.\r\n\r\n\"O,\" replied Robert, laughing, \"it is only his way of asking us to visit\r\nour friend the bear.  What do you think of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"We have _promised_ to make Mrs. Bruin a visit,\" said Harold, entering\r\ninto the joke; \"and perhaps she may think it hard if we do not keep our\r\nword.\"  Just then the conch called them home.  \"But let us hear what\r\nMary and Frank have to say.  I foresee difficulties all around.\"\r\n\r\nWhen the question was discussed in general conclave, Mary looked rather\r\nsober.  She had not yet recovered wholly from her former fright; but not\r\nwilling to interfere with a frolic, from which the others seemed to\r\nanticipate so much pleasure, although it seemed to her to be one of\r\nneedless peril, she replied that she would consent on two\r\nconditions--one was that they should go on the raft, to save the immense\r\nwalk to the spot, and the other was that they should either put her and\r\nFrank in some place of safety while they fought the bear, or supply her\r\nwith an abundance of hot water.\r\n\r\n\"That idea of the raft is capital,\" said Robert.  \"The tide will suit\r\nexactly for floating down in the morning and back in the afternoon.  I\r\nthink we can give sister all she asks, and the hot water too, if she\r\ninsists upon it.\"\r\n\r\nA word here about tides on the western coast of Florida.  From Cape\r\nRomano, or Punta Largo, northward to Tampa, and beyond, there is but one\r\ntide in the course of the day, and that with a rise usually of not more\r\nthan three feet.  But south of Cape Romano, and particularly in the\r\nneighbourhood of Chatham Bay, there are two, as in other parts of the\r\nworld, except that they are of unequal lengths, one occupying six, and\r\nthe other eighteen hours, with its flood and ebb.  People there call\r\nthem \"the tide and half tide.\"  The plan of the boys was to float down\r\non the nine hour ebb, and to return on the three hour flood.\r\n\r\nSam’s notions about the observation of Christmas eve, as a part of\r\nChristmas, suited exactly the inclination of the boys; their hands were\r\nblistered, and they were glad of a good excuse for leaving off work, by\r\nan hour or two of the sun.  In anticipation of the next day’s absence,\r\nand of the Sabbath succeeding, Frank gathered during the afternoon\r\nplenty of acorns for the poultry, and grass for the deer and goats,\r\nwhich were to be kept in their fold; and the others laid up a supply of\r\nwood for the fire.  Mary sliced some nice pieces of venison and bear’s\r\nmeat, and made some bread and Christmas cakes; all, which she packed\r\naway in a basket, with oranges, limes, and a bottle of transparent\r\nhoney.  Long before dark everything was ready for the expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS MORNING--VOYAGE--VALUABLE DISCOVERY--HOSTILE\r\nINVASION--ROBBERY--MASTERLY RETREAT--BATTLE AT LAST--A QUARREL REQUIRES\r\nTWO QUARRELLERS--THE GHOST’S VISIT\r\n\r\n\r\nThere may have been many a more noisy Christmas, but never a brighter\r\none, and few merrier, than that which dawned upon our young marooners;\r\nnor was it entirely without its noise. The boys had requested Sam, in\r\ncase he was first awake, to rouse them at the break of day, and he had\r\npromised to do so.  A secret whispering had been observed between him\r\nand Frank; and the latter had also begged for a piece of twine, which he\r\npromised to return, but the use of which he refused to tell.\r\nConjecturing that it was intended for some piece of harmless fun, they\r\ngave it to him, and waited his own time to reveal the purpose.\r\n\r\nOn going to bed Mary noticed that Frank fidgetted a great deal with his\r\ntoes, and seemed to be much tickled with several remarks made by\r\nhimself, but which seemed to her to have nothing in them particularly\r\nwitty.  He was evidently in a frolic, and wanted excuses to laugh. In\r\nthe dead of night, as Mary supposed, though it was really just before\r\nday, she was awakened by feeling him move restlessly, and then put his\r\nhands to his feet with the inquiry:\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter with my toe?\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there anything the matter with it!\" she drowsily asked.\r\n\r\n\"O, no, nothing at all,\" he replied.  \"I dreamed that a rat was gnawing\r\nit off.  But it is only a string I tied there myself.\"\r\n\r\nHe then turned over, and lay still, pretending to be asleep; but when he\r\nheard her breathe hard, he slipped out of bed, put on his clothes, and\r\nwent softly out of the tent.  Sam had agreed to wake him, so that they\r\ntwo might, according to Christmas custom, \"catch\" the others, by hailing\r\nthem first; and as Sam could not go into the room where Mary slept, he\r\npersuaded Frank to tie a string to one of his toes, and to pass the\r\nother end outside of the tent.  It was Sam’s pulling at this string that\r\ngave Frank his dream, and finally waked him.  For a minute or two they\r\nwhispered together in merry mood, and on Sam’s saying, \"Now, Mas Frank,\r\nnow!\" the roar of two guns, and then the sound of a conch, broke upon\r\nthe ears of the startled sleepers.\r\n\r\n\"Good morning, lazy folks!\" said Frank, bursting into the tent.  \"Merry\r\nChristmas to you all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Merry Christmas, Mas Robbut!\" Sam echoed from behind, \"Merry Christmas,\r\nMas Harrol!  Merry Christmas, little Missus!\"\r\n\r\n\"Fairly caught!\" answered Robert; \"and now, I suppose, we must look out\r\nsome presents for you both.\"\r\n\r\nThe company completed their toilet, and came together under the awning,\r\nwhich was still their kitchen. The day star was \"flaming\" gloriously,\r\nand the approach of day was marked by a hazy belt of light above the\r\neastern horizon.  They kindled their fire, and prepared for breakfast,\r\nwith many jests and kind expressions; then sobering themselves to a\r\nbecoming gravity, they sat around the red blaze, and engaged in their\r\nusual morning worship.\r\n\r\nWhile the sun threw his first slanting beams across the island, Harold\r\nwent to the landing, and returned, saying, \"Come all.  The tide has been\r\ngoing down for hours, and is now running like a mill-tail!\"\r\n\r\nHastening their preparations, they were in a short time seated upon the\r\nraft, Sam at the helm, and Robert and Harold by turn at the oars.  Borne\r\nby the current, and impelled by their own efforts, they were not two\r\nhours in reaching the proposed landing place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: They were not two hours in reaching the proposed landing\r\nplace]\r\n\r\nThe river was exceedingly crooked, and so densely bordered with\r\nmangroves, that from the place they left to that which they sought, it\r\nwas nowhere possible for them to reach the shore.  Once when they\r\napproached nearest land, they saw a herd of deer peep inquisitively at\r\nthem through an opening glade, and turn quietly to feed.  The tall heron\r\nwas a frequent sight, lifting its long blue neck high as their heads,\r\nand then flapping its broad wings to escape too near an approach; and\r\nthe dapper kingfisher turning his big head to look at them; and the\r\n\"poor jobs,\" or small white cranes clustering thick upon the dead trees;\r\nand the Spanish curlew sticking forward its long curved bill; and the\r\ngrey curlew with its keen note; and the marsh hens, cackling far and\r\nnear, to say (such is the report) that the tide is moving; and ducks\r\nrising in clouds from different points of the marsh and reaches of the\r\nriver;--these sights were very frequent, and seen with the bright eyes\r\nof young people on a Christmas excursion, imparted a charming vivacity\r\nto the scene.\r\n\r\nPassing a creek which drained the marsh to their left, they made a\r\ndiscovery, which proved a valuable one indeed.  Harold was looking up\r\nthe creek with that universal scrutiny that had become in him second\r\nnature, when he suddenly dropped his oars, exclaiming, \"What is that?\"\r\n\r\nThe raft shot so quickly past that no one but Sam had time to look.  He,\r\nhowever, replied instantly, \"Starn ob a vessel!\"\r\n\r\n\"Stern of a vessel, did you say?\" inquired Robert. \"’Bout ship, Sam.\r\nCome, Harold, let us pull right for it and see.\"\r\n\r\nThey brought the raft into an eddy near shore, and though it required a\r\nprodigious pull to propel so clumsy a thing against the tide from the\r\ncreek, they managed to do so, and discovered not the stern of a vessel\r\nonly, but the whole of a small brig turned bottom upwards, and lying\r\nacross the creek jammed in the mud and mangroves.\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is indeed a Christmas gift worth having,\" said Robert.  \"Did\r\nI say Santa Claus never heard of this island?  I take that back; he has\r\nnot forgotten us.\"\r\n\r\n\"He or some One greater,\" interposed Mary, with seriousness.\r\n\r\nThey rowed alongside, and tried to enter; but having no tools for\r\npenetrating the vessel’s side, nor candles for lighting them after they\r\nhad entered, they concluded to prosecute their voyage, and to delay\r\ntheir visit to the wreck till Monday.\r\n\r\nWith this intention they pushed out of the creek, and descended to the\r\nproposed landing, where they made fast their raft to a crooked root, and\r\nstepped upon a firm beach of mixed mud and sand.  The fiddlers (a small\r\nvariety of crabs that look at a little distance like enormous black\r\nspiders) were scampering in every direction, with their mouths covered\r\nwith foam, and their threatening claws raised in self-defence, until\r\neach one dived into its little hole, and peeped slyly at the strange\r\nintruders.  A wild cat sat upon a neighbouring tree, watching their\r\nmotions with as much composure as if she were a favourite tabby in her\r\nmistress’ parlour.  Frank was the first to spy and point it out.  It was\r\nwithin a good rifle shot.\r\n\r\n\"Stand still a moment, if you wish to see how far a cat can jump,\" said\r\nHarold.\r\n\r\nHe rested his rifle upon a small tree, and taking steady aim, sent the\r\nball, from a distance of seventy yards, through both sides of the cat,\r\ndirectly behind the shoulders.  She leaped an immense distance, and fell\r\ndead. Frank seized it, saying it was _his_ cat, and that he intended to\r\ntake off its skin, and make it into a cap like cousin Harold’s.\r\n\r\nFrom the landing they followed the mark left by their hatchet upon the\r\ntrees in their exploring tour, and it was not long before they\r\nrecognized from a distance the poplar or tulip tree, in the hollow base\r\nof which the bear had made her den.\r\n\r\nAs yet Mum had given no indications of alarm; but on approaching the\r\ntree the boys selected for Mary and Frank a pretty little oak, with\r\nhorizontal branches, in full sight of the den; and having prepared them\r\na seat made comfortable with moss, and helped them into it, advanced to\r\nthe field of battle.\r\n\r\nTo their disappointment the old bear was gone.  The sun shone full into\r\nthe hole, and revealed the two cubs alone, nicely rolled up in the\r\nmiddle of their bed, and soundly asleep.  There was some reason to\r\nsuppose that the mother would return before they left the neighbourhood,\r\nand in this expectation Harold prepared to secure the cubs.  He placed\r\nRobert and Sam as videttes at a little distance, and also charged Mary\r\nand Frank to keep a sharp look out from their elevated position, while\r\nMum and Fidelle were set to beating the surrounding bushes as scouts.\r\nBut, notwithstanding all his care and skill, he found that the work of\r\ncapturing the cubs was very difficult.  The cavity being too large to\r\nallow of reaching them with his arms, and afraid to trust himself inside\r\nthe hole, lest the old bear should arrive and catch him in the act, he\r\nrelied upon throwing a slip noose over their heads, or upon their feet;\r\nbut young as they were he found them astonishingly expert in warding off\r\nhis traps.  The only plan by which he at last succeeded, was with a\r\nhooked pole, by which he drew forth first one, and then the other, to\r\nthe mouth of the den, where, after sundry bites and scratches, he seized\r\ntheir hind legs, passed a cord round their necks, and made it secure by\r\na fast knot.  This done, he tied each to a tree, where they growled and\r\nwhined loudly for help.  The hunters were now in a momentary expectation\r\nof hearing the bushes burst asunder, and seeing the old bear come\r\nroaring upon them; but she was too far distant, and had no suspicion of\r\nthe savage robbery that was going on at her quiet home.\r\n\r\nIt was fully an hour before the cubs were taken and secured.  By that\r\ntime Mary and Frank had become so weary of their unnatural roosting,\r\nthat they begged the others to cease their hunt, and return at once to\r\nthe raft. But here arose a new and unforeseen difficulty.  The distance\r\nto the raft was considerable, and the way was so tangled that they had\r\nmade slow progress when they came; what could they now do, encumbered\r\nwith two disorderly captives, and in constant danger of attack from the\r\nfiercest beast of the forest, \"a bear robbed of her whelps\"?  It was\r\neasy enough to decide this question, if they would consent to free the\r\ncaptives and return as they came.  But no one, except Mary and Frank,\r\nentertained this idea for a moment; they would have been ashamed to give\r\nup through fear what they had undertaken through choice.\r\n\r\nThe plan they at last devised was this--which though appearing to assign\r\nthe post of danger to the youngest, was in fact the safest they could\r\nadopt.  Mary and Frank led each a cub, but they were instructed to drop\r\nthe cord on the first appearance of danger, and run to the safest point.\r\nSam marched in the van, Harold brought up the rear; Mary and Frank were\r\nin the centre, and while Robert guarded one flank, the dogs were kept as\r\nmuch as possible on the other.  It was with much misgiving that this\r\nplan was adopted, for the boys began to feel that they had engaged in a\r\nfoolish scrape, involving a needless exposure of the young people, as\r\nwell as of themselves.  But they were now _in for it_, and they had no\r\nchoice, except to go forward or to give up the project in disgrace.\r\nFormed in retreating column as described, and ready for instant battle,\r\nthey turned their faces to the river, and marched with what haste they\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nThey had not gone many steps, however, before Harold suddenly faced\r\nabout, levelled his piece, and called to them to \"look out!\"  He heard a\r\nbush move behind him, and supposed, of course, that it was the bear\r\ncoming in pursuit, but it proved to be only a bent twig righting itself\r\nto its natural position.\r\n\r\nNot long after Robert raised a similar alarm on his side, and levelled\r\nhis gun at some unseen object that was moving rapidly through the\r\nbushes.  Mary and Frank dropped the cords, and Frank clambered up a\r\nsmall tree near at hand.  Mary turned very pale, and ran first to Sam,\r\nbut hearing the noise approach that way, she ran back to Harold for\r\nprotection.  The next moment she saw Sam drop his gun from its aim, and\r\ncall out,\r\n\r\n\"You Mum!  Come in, sah!  You git yo’ libber shot out o’ you, you scary\r\nwarment!\"\r\n\r\nThe alarm was occasioned by Mum, who, unperceived by any, had wandered\r\nto the wrong side.\r\n\r\nThe cubs, trained by this time to obey the cord, and either weary with\r\nthe walk, or submissive to a fate that seemed so gentle, had not stirred\r\nfrom the spot where they were left.  Frank slipped quietly from his\r\ntree, hoping that nobody had seen him; but Robert caught his eye, and\r\ngave a sly wink, to which Frank doggedly replied,\r\n\r\n\"I don’t care, sir.  I suspect you would like to have been up a tree\r\ntoo, if you could have got there.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I should, Frank,\" said Robert; \"but it seems that you are the only\r\none of the crowd who can find trees in time when bears are about.\"\r\n\r\nThey resumed their march to the landing, and were interrupted only once\r\nmore.  The bushes before them rustled loudly, Fidelle rushed forward in\r\npursuit, and the ground shook with the heavy trampling of some large\r\nbeast.  It was on Sam’s side; but as he brought his piece to a level,\r\nHarold cried, \"Deer! deer! don’t shoot!\" and again all was quiet.\r\n\r\nA short walk brought them to the landing; where they wiped their moist\r\nbrows, and rested, thankful that they had completed their perilous\r\njourney without accident. But their dangers were by no means over.  The\r\ntide was down; the raft was aground; it was not possible to leave for\r\nhours; and in the meantime the enraged beast might follow the trace of\r\nher cubs, and perhaps assault them where they were.  In view of this\r\ncontingency they tied the young bears at a distance from the shore, but\r\nwithin sight of their own place of repose, confident that if the mother\r\ncame she would bestow her first care in breaking their bonds, and taking\r\nthem away, in which case they could attack and destroy her.\r\n\r\nWith this expectation they sat down to their Christmas dinner, for which\r\nthey had by this time a pretty keen appetite.  Sam stood sentry while\r\nthey ate; then Robert and Harold by turns took his post, and gave him\r\nopportunity to dine.  The spice of danger gave great zest to the\r\nenjoyment of all except Mary, who would vastly have preferred being at\r\ntheir comparatively secure and quiet home upon the prairie.\r\n\r\nThe tide finally rose, and floated the raft.  They once more embarked.\r\nThe young bears were secured, so that they could neither escape nor\r\nannoy.  The fastening was cast off.  Harold’s oar, which he used as a\r\npole for shoving off, sunk in the yielding sand, and Robert’s \"Heigh ho\r\nfor home!\" was hardly uttered, when they heard a tramping on the bluff,\r\nand a moment after saw the bear standing on the spot they had left.  She\r\nstared in surprise at the retreating raft, whined affectionately to her\r\ncubs, who whined in answer, and tried to break loose; then seeing their\r\nefforts to be ineffectual, and the raft to be moving away, she raised\r\nsuch a roar as made every heart tremble, and with a fierce look at the\r\npersons on board plunged into the water.  The raft was by this time but\r\nten yards from shore, and slowly \"backing\" into the stream.  Harold’s\r\nrifle was quickly at his shoulder, and in a second more the blood\r\nspouted from the mouth and nose of the terrible beast.  But the wound\r\nwas not mortal, piercing below the eyes, and entering the nostrils and\r\nthroat; and blowing out the blood by successive snorts, she plunged on,\r\nand began to swim.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Robert!\" shouted Harold, \"be steady!  Aim between her eyes!\"\r\n\r\nRobert fired first one barrel, and then the other; the bear sunk for a\r\nmoment, borne down by the heavy shot, but she rose again, streaming with\r\ngore, and roaring till the waters trembled.  Sam’s gun was the only\r\nremaining chance, and he used it most judiciously.  Waiting until the\r\nbear was almost ready to place her feet upon the raft, he coolly\r\nlevelled his gun, and putting the muzzle within a few inches of her ear,\r\npoured its contents bodily into her brain.  The furious creature had\r\njust time to grasp the side of the raft; she gave one convulsive shake,\r\nand turned on her side, stone dead.\r\n\r\n\"It was a desperate fight,\" said Robert, drawing a long breath.\r\n\r\n\"And a very foolish one,\" rejoined Harold.  \"I have been thinking for\r\nthe last hour that we might have been better employed.\"\r\n\r\nRobert looked displeased.  \"Answer for yourself.  If it is foolish, you\r\nhelped to bring it on.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know that,\" replied Harold, with mildness, \"and that makes me condemn\r\nit the more.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then please, sir, not to blame the rest,\" said Robert, \"for I am sure\r\neverybody behaved as bravely as people could.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not questioned any one’s courage, nor have I quarrelled with any\r\none except myself,\" replied Harold.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, you have,\" persisted Robert, \"you called us all a parcel of\r\nfools for coming on a Christmas excursion.\"\r\n\r\n\"O! no, brother,\" mediated Mary, \"he only said we might have been better\r\nemployed; and I think father would say so too.  I am sure if I had known\r\nall before coming, as I know it now, I should not have given my\r\nconsent.\"\r\n\r\n\"Please, mossa,\" said Sam, looking from one to the other, \"’tain’t any\r\no’ you been de fool.  Nobody fool but me.  Enty I ax you,[#] please come\r\nsee my countryman in de hollow tree; and you come?  And now, please,\r\nmossa, don’t let my countryman git away.  See he floatin’ away to de\r\nalligator.  Please let me catch ’em.  I want him fat to fry my hominy.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[#] Did not I ask you.\r\n\r\n\r\nSam looked so whimsical throughout the whole of this eloquent appeal,\r\nthat Robert’s face relaxed from its stern and angry expression, and at\r\nthe last words he caught Harold’s eye, and burst into a laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Harold,\" said he, \"let us save his fat; I know his mouth waters\r\nfor it.\"\r\n\r\nThe quarrel was over.  Indeed it could not properly be called a quarrel,\r\nfor it was all on one side, and no one can quarrel alone.  They caught\r\nthe floating carcass, tied it behind the raft, then pulling into the\r\ncurrent, floated rapidly home, and reached the prairie about the middle\r\nof the afternoon.\r\n\r\nFor the rest of the day their hands were full; and it was not until late\r\nat night that they were able to retire. The young bears were first\r\nstowed away in the same pen with the goats and deer, but Harold was\r\nscarcely able to remove them in time to save their lives; for Nanny,\r\nafter running from them as far as the limits of the pen allowed, rose\r\nupon her hind legs with a desperate baa! and bringing her stony forehead\r\nagainst the head of the nearest, laid it senseless on the ground, and\r\nwas preparing to serve the other in the same way.\r\n\r\nWhat to do with them Harold did not know.  He dared not put them in the\r\npoultry house, and he was unwilling either to shelter them in the tent\r\nor to tie them outside the palisade.  So, until some other arrangement\r\ncould be devised, he fastened them to a stake inside the enclosure round\r\nthe tent, where he supplied them with water, honey, and a piece of\r\nvenison.\r\n\r\nThe adventure, however, was not quite over.  Late in the night Sam was\r\nawaked by feeling something move upon his bed, and put its cold nose\r\nupon his face. Thinking it was some one walking in his sleep, he called\r\nout, \"Who dah?\" and putting out his hand, felt to his dismay the rough\r\nhead and shaggy skin of a bear.  Sam was a firm believer in ghosts, both\r\nhuman and brute. He gave one groan, and cried out, \"O massy!\" expecting\r\nthe next moment to be overpowered, if not torn to pieces; then jumping\r\nfrom bed in the greatest hurry, he hunted tremulously for some weapon of\r\ndefence, exclaiming all the while,\r\n\r\n\"Mas Harrol!  Mas Robbut!  O massy!  Here de ole bear, or else he ghost,\r\ncome after us.\"\r\n\r\nThe taper was brought from Mary’s room, and disclosed the secret.  One\r\nof the cubs feeling in the chill, night air the want of its mother’s\r\nwarmth, had loosed the insecure fastening, and come to seek more\r\ncomfortable quarters in the tent.  \"It is your countryman’s baby, Sam,\"\r\nsaid Robert, after the excitement had subsided. \"You killed its mother,\r\nand it has come, poor little orphan, to ask that you shall be its daddy\r\nnow.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CUBS--VOYAGE TO THE WRECK--STORES--HORRID SIGHTS--TRYING\r\nPREDICAMENT--PRIZES--RETURN--FRANK NEEDS ANOTHER LECTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly on Monday morning Robert and Harold set out for the wreck, leaving\r\nSam to guard the young people, and to add another apartment to the fold,\r\nfor the accommodation of the cubs.  It may be stated here, that the new\r\npets had eaten little or nothing since they were taken.  For several\r\ndays Sam was compelled to force the food and water into their mouths;\r\nbut after they had acquired the art of feeding in a domestic way, Frank\r\nassumed their whole care, and was indefatigable in attending to their\r\nwants and their education.  He taught them to stand on their hind feet\r\nand beg; to make a bow by scraping their feet, like country clowns; and\r\nmany a wrestling match did he have with them, in which for a long time\r\nhe was invariably the victor.  Robert named them, after the twins of\r\nold, Castor and Pollux.\r\n\r\nBy Sam’s advice, the boys took with them on their voyage an ax, hatchet,\r\nauger, and saw, together with some candles and a rope, and reached the\r\nwreck about nine o’clock.  They moored their raft fast to a projecting\r\nbolt, and then, with much difficulty, succeeded in reaching the stern\r\nwindows, from which the receding tide flowed gently, bearing on its\r\nbosom an unpleasant odour, like that of animal matter long decayed.\r\nThey peeped into the dark cavity, and receiving a full blast of its\r\nsepulchral odours, drew back in disgust.\r\n\r\n\"I cannot go into _that_ hole,\" said Harold, \"it is stifling.  Let us\r\ncut a passage through the side or bottom.\"\r\n\r\nClambering along the sloping side next the rudder, they selected a place\r\nfor their scuttle, and commenced to work, but the thick and well\r\nfastened copper was so difficult to remove, that their hatchet was\r\nnearly ruined before they reached the wood.  Then, with their auger,\r\nthey made an entrance for the saw, and soon opened a hole between two of\r\nthe ribs, large enough to admit their bodies.\r\n\r\nHarold descended first, and standing upon a hogshead, which, being on\r\nthe top of a confused pile, reached near the hole, lit a candle, and\r\nhelped Robert to descend.\r\n\r\nThey were in the hold where all the grosser articles were stowed.  Some\r\nof the hogsheads visible appeared to contain sugar, others molasses,\r\nrum, &c.  Passing towards the stern, they saw half a dozen boxes and\r\ncrates, of different sizes, one of which was filled with lemons, and\r\nfrom the other, on being broken, rolled out a cocoanut.  Returning from\r\nthis hasty survey towards the forward part of the hold, they discovered\r\na plentiful supply of flour, ship-bread, rice, hams, and beef, stowed\r\naway in the style appropriate to each.  The vessel was evidently\r\nvictualled for a long voyage.\r\n\r\nSatisfied with this partial examination, they returned amidships, and\r\nsought the hatchway, through which they might descend into the habitable\r\npart of the vessel.  It was choked by such a multitude of boxes and\r\nbags, that they were a long time in finding it, and longer still in\r\nfreeing it from encumbrances.  Descending by their rope, they found\r\nthemselves on the inner side of the inverted deck.  The water had by\r\nthis time all run off, except a puddle in one corner; and the floor, or\r\nrather that which had been ceiling, was wet and slimy, with deposits\r\nfrom the muddy river water.\r\n\r\nOn entering the cabin the sight which greeted them was horrid.  There\r\nlay four skeletons, of a man and woman, a boy and girl, handsomely\r\ndressed; the soiled though costly garments still adhering to the wet and\r\nghastly bones.  The sight was more than Harold could endure; he called\r\nto Robert, and hastened as fast as possible to the open air.\r\n\r\n\"O, horrid! horrid!\" said he, pale as a sheet.  \"I don’t think I can\r\never go back to that dreadful cabin. It made me almost faint.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was horrid, indeed,\" responded Robert.  \"But you will soon recover;\r\nthe trouble was more in your mind than in your body.  I doubt not you\r\nare feeling as father says he felt when going first into a dissecting\r\nroom--he fainted outright; and he said that this is no uncommon thing\r\nwith beginners, but they soon become used to it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am willing enough to go through the whole vessel,\" said Harold, \"but\r\nnot into that cabin, for a while at least.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor creatures!\" sighed Robert, \"they appear to have been passengers;\r\nand unless the cabin filled soon with water, they must have had a\r\nlingering death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Don’t speak of it,\" Harold pleaded.  \"The bare thought makes me\r\nshudder.  And then to think of their being devoured by such slimy things\r\nas eels and catfish, and of being pinched to pieces by crabs, as these\r\nbodies were--it is sickening!\"\r\n\r\nRobert perceived that these reflections were exceedingly painful to his\r\ncousin, and had been in fact the cause of his sickness; he therefore\r\nmanaged adroitly to shift the conversation from point to point, until it\r\ngradually assumed a cheerful character.  Pleasant thoughts were the\r\nmedicine Harold needed, and in the course of a few minutes he himself\r\nproposed to renew the search.\r\n\r\nDescending between decks, they found in the side of the vessel, contrary\r\nto custom, the cook’s room.  It contained a stove, with all its\r\nappurtenances complete.  This was a real treasure; they rejoiced to\r\nthink how much labour and trouble would be saved to Mary, whose patience\r\nand ingenuity were often put to the test for the want of suitable\r\nutensils.\r\n\r\nThe steward’s room adjoined; and here they found crockery of all sorts,\r\nthough most of it was in fragments; knives, forks, spoons, and\r\ncandlesticks, none of which they valued, having plenty of their own; two\r\nbottles of olives, and a case of anchovies, sound and good, and a fine\r\nset of castors, partly broken, containing mustard, pepper, catsup and\r\nvinegar.  Upon the topmost shelf (or under what _had been_ the lowest)\r\nwere two large lockers, which they opened with difficulty, the door\r\nbeing fast glued with paste, and out of which poured a deluge of musty\r\nflour from an upturned barrel.  There were also different kinds of hard\r\nbiscuit and ship bread, but they were all spoiled.\r\n\r\nFrom these two rooms they passed with great difficulty to the\r\nforecastle, having to cut their way through a thick partition.  Here the\r\nsight was more appalling than that which they had witnessed in the\r\ncabin.  Lying on the floor, partly immersed in a muddy pool, were the\r\nskeletons of eight men and two boys; and in the midst of them they heard\r\nsuch a splashing of the water that their blood ran cold, and their hair\r\nstood on end.  They started back in terror, thinking at first that the\r\ndead had waked from sleep, and were moving before their eyes; in doing\r\nso, Robert, who carried the candle, jostled roughly against Harold, and\r\ninstantly they were in darkness.\r\n\r\n\"O mercy! mercy!\" Robert ejaculated, in an agony of alarm, and falling\r\nupon his knees clasped his hands together, expecting every moment to be\r\nhis last.  Harold, however, with that presence of mind which is the mark\r\nof true courage, and is the best preservative in time of danger, threw\r\nhis arms around him, to prevent him from escaping, and fortunately\r\nrecovered the candle, which had dropped in the edge of the wet slime\r\nupon the floor.\r\n\r\n\"Nothing but fishes!\" said he, divining the state of Robert’s mind from\r\nwhat he knew of his own.  \"Nothing but fishes!  I saw one leap from the\r\nwater.  Softly, Robert, let us light the candle.\"\r\n\r\nThe quieting effect of a soft, calm voice in a season of excitement is\r\nmagical.  Robert’s excessive fear subsided, and though he trembled\r\nviolently, he aided Harold to re-light the candle.  Fortunately the wick\r\nwas scarcely touched by the water; there was a slight spluttering from a\r\nparticle or two of damp mud, but the flame soon rose bright as ever.\r\nHarold’s hand now began to tremble; for though in the moment of trial\r\nhis nerves had been stretched and steady as a tense wire, the re-action\r\nwas so great that he began to feel weak.  Robert perceived this, and\r\npulling his sleeve said,\r\n\r\n\"Come, let us go.\"\r\n\r\nHarold’s courage, however, was of that sturdy kind that rises with the\r\noccasion, and he replied, \"No, I mean to go through with it now.  I was\r\ndriven from the cabin by a bad smell, but no one shall say that I was\r\nscared off by a few catfish.  Look, do you not see them floundering in\r\nthe water?\"\r\n\r\nA calm inspection wholly relieved Robert from his fears, and he\r\ncontinued to examine the room with composure, although while looking he\r\nbeheld the startling sight of a skeleton in actual motion through the\r\nwater, a large fish having entered its cavity, and become entangled in\r\nthe adhering clothes, giving a most lifelike motion to the arms and\r\nlegs.\r\n\r\nA glance around this room was sufficient to convince them that the\r\nvessel was of a warlike character.  Great numbers of guns, pistols,\r\ncutlasses, and pikes, were visible on the floor, where they had fallen\r\ninto the water, or against the walls where they had been fastened.  The\r\nboys surveyed these significant appendages, exchanged glances with each\r\nother, and simultaneously exclaimed, \"A cutter, or a pirate!\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt whether it can be a cutter,\" said Robert; \"my mind misgives me\r\nthat it is a vessel of bad character.  But we can tell by going to the\r\ncaptain’s room. Let us see.\"\r\n\r\nThey returned to the cabin, and entering the room which appeared to be\r\nthe captain’s, found it abundantly supplied with arms of various sorts,\r\nand (though mostly injured by the sea-water) of exquisite finish.  Of\r\npapers they saw none; these were probably contained in a heavy iron\r\nchest which was fast locked, and the key of which was nowhere to be\r\nfound.  In the mate’s room, however, the evidences were more decisive.\r\nThere were flags of all nations; and among them one whose hue was jet\r\nblack, except in the middle, where were sewed the snow-white figures of\r\na skull and cross-bones.  From the side-pocket of a coat, which lay in\r\nthe berth, they took a pocket-book, containing letters in Spanish, and a\r\npaper signed by forty-two names, the greater part of which were marked\r\nby a cross.  These indications were satisfactory, and the boys\r\nafterwards ascertained by circumstantial evidence, which left them no\r\nshadow of a doubt, that not only was the vessel piratical, but that she\r\nwas overwhelmed by the same storm that had so nearly proved fatal to\r\nSam.  The prize, therefore, they considered their own by right of first\r\ndiscovery--stores, arms, magazine, money and all.\r\n\r\n\"By rights there ought to be a carpenter’s room somewhere,\" said Robert;\r\n\"or if not a room, there must be tools, which will help us greatly in\r\nour work.  Let us look for them.\"\r\n\r\nTo Harold’s mind the tools were the most valuable part of the prize,\r\nunless indeed they could find a boat ready made.  But before proceeding,\r\nthey took each a pistol from the captain’s room, loaded, and thrust it\r\ninto their bosoms, supposing that they should be more calm and\r\nself-possessed, when conscious of having about them the means of\r\ndefence.  The carpenter’s room was found, and in it a chest of splendid\r\ntools, and an excellent grindstone.\r\n\r\nWith these discoveries the boys were content to think of returning home;\r\nand now they began to feel hungry. Taking from the steward’s room the\r\nbottle of olives and case of anchovies, and breaking open a barrel of\r\nshipbread, from which they filled their pockets, they went to the open\r\nair, taking each a lemon and cocoanut, in lieu of water and dessert.\r\n\r\nIt was time to load the raft.  Taking some small bags, of which they\r\nfound a number, they filled them with sugar, coffee, rice, and flour;\r\nthey brought out six hams, and, by opening a barrel, six pieces of\r\nmess-beef.  In searching still further, they lit upon a barrel of\r\nmackerel, a firkin of good butter, and a case of English cheese; of each\r\nof which they took a portion, and laid all upon the most level part of\r\nthe vessel’s bottom, ready for lowering into the raft.  The kegs of\r\nbiscuit they found on trial to be too large to pass through their\r\nscuttle; they emptied them by parcels into a large bag outside.\r\n\r\nHitherto they had said nothing and thought little about money; for their\r\nminds had been fixed on supplying themselves with necessaries and\r\ncomforts, together with the means of returning home.  Indeed, the idea\r\nof enriching themselves at the expense of the dead, even if they were\r\npirates, savoured rather of robbery, and the delicate sense of the young\r\nexplorers was offended by the thought.\r\n\r\n\"But let us at least gather whatever of this sort we may find,\" said\r\nHarold, after exchanging thoughts with his cousin.  \"We can afterwards\r\nask your father to decide what use shall be made of it.\"\r\n\r\nNeither their consciences nor their pockets, however, were very heavily\r\nburdened with this new charge; for they found only a few hundred\r\ndollars’ worth of money, chiefly in foreign gold, together with several\r\nrich jewels, the greater part of which was discovered in consequence of\r\nan act of kindness to Mary and Frank.\r\n\r\nResolving to return the next day, accompanied by the whole party, and\r\nunwilling to have Mary’s nerves shocked as theirs had been, they\r\ndetermined to remove all unsightly objects from the cabin, and to close\r\nthem up in the forecastle.  A box of sperm candles enabled them to set a\r\nlight along the dark passages, and in each room; and taking a small\r\nsail, upon which they carefully drew the skeletons, they carried them to\r\nthe forecastle, and laid them decently in one corner.  From the person\r\nof the man they took a gold watch and chain, a handsome pencil case, and\r\npocket-knife, a purse containing several pieces of gold, and a\r\npocket-book, containing papers, written apparently in Spanish, but\r\nalmost perfectly illegible.  The name of this man, marked upon the\r\nclothing, and occasionally appearing in the papers, was Manuel De Rosa.\r\nUpon the person of the lady were found a diamond ring, hanging loosely\r\nupon the slender bone of one finger, and on the lace cape over her bosom\r\na sprig breast-pin, whose leaves were emerald, and its flower of opal.\r\nHer name, and that of the children also, was De Rosa.  These valuables\r\nwere collected into a parcel, together with a lock of hair from each, as\r\nthe means of identifying them, should any clue be obtained to their\r\nhistory and their home.\r\n\r\nWhile removing a coarsely clothed skeleton from that corner of the\r\nforecastle in which they wished to deposit the bones of the perished\r\nfamily, they found it so much heavier than the others, as to induce a\r\ncloser examination.  They found hid beneath the clothing, and belted to\r\nthe bones, a large girdle, containing fifty-four Mexican dollars, a\r\nvariety of gold pieces from different nations, and a lump of what\r\nappeared to be gold and silver fused into one mass.  The name of this\r\nman could not be ascertained.\r\n\r\nTheir next work was to fumigate the cabin.  They wrapped a little sugar\r\nin a piece of brown paper, and setting it on fire, walked around the\r\nroom, waving it in every direction.  The aromatic odour of the burnt\r\nsugar pervaded every crack and cranny, and overwhelmed so entirely the\r\ndisgusting effluvium, that Robert snuffed at the pleasant fragrance, and\r\nremarked, \"There, now! the cabin is fit for the nose of a king.  Let us\r\nclose up the forecastle, and return home.\"\r\n\r\nBeside the provisions, which have been already mentioned as constituting\r\na part of the intended load for the raft, the boys carried out such\r\ntools as they conceived needful for their work, consisting of adzes,\r\ndrawing-knives, augers, gimlets, chisels, planes, saws, square and\r\ncompass, and an oil-stone.  They also took the box of sperm candles and\r\na box of soap; three cutlasses and a rapier, four pikes, four pair of\r\npistols, three rifles, two muskets, and flasks and pouches to suit.\r\nGunpowder they did not see, except what was in the flasks; they knew\r\nthere must be plenty in the magazine, which they supposed to be near the\r\nofficers’ rooms, but which they did not care then to visit.\r\n\r\nA short but laborious tug against the tide, that set strongly up the\r\ncreek, brought them to the river, on which they floated gently home.\r\nWhen within half a mile of the landing, they fired a gun, as a signal of\r\ntheir approach; and long before they reached the shore, Mary and Frank\r\nwere seen running to meet them, with Mum and Fidelle scampering before,\r\nand Sam hobbling far in the rear.\r\n\r\n\"Here, Frank, is your Christmas present,\" said Robert, when the raft\r\ntouched land; \"and here, Sam, is yours, at least so long as we stay upon\r\nthe island.\"\r\n\r\nHe tossed the one a cocoanut, and handed the other a musket and cutlass.\r\nHarold’s presents were still more acceptable; he gave Frank a nice\r\npocket-knife, somewhat the worse for rust, and gave Sam a large twist of\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\nFrank’s eyes twinkled with pleasure at the sight of the knife; but Sam’s\r\nexpression of countenance was really ludicrous.  He was a great chewer\r\nand smoker of tobacco, and the sight of that big black twist, after so\r\nlong a privation, brought the tears to his eyes.  He scraped his foot,\r\nand tried to laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Tankee, Mas Robbut!  Tousand tankee to you, Mas Harrol!  Sword, gun,\r\ntobacky!  I-ee!  I feel like I kin fight all de bear and panter in de\r\nwull!\"\r\n\r\nAs the work of unloading and transporting to the tent occupied only\r\nabout two hours, they had time sufficient, before dark, to construct\r\nanother and a larger raft.  There was a poplar, fallen and dry, near the\r\nwater’s edge; this they cut into suitable lengths, and across the long\r\nlogs they laid a floor of short ones, so that they doubted not being\r\nable at their next load to bring from the wreck all that they wished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nSECOND VOYAGE TO THE WRECK--FUMIGATING AGAIN--MORE MINUTE\r\nEXAMINATION--RETURN--ACCIDENT--DANGERS OF HELPING A DROWNING\r\nPERSON--RECOVERING A PERSON APPARENTLY DROWNED\r\n\r\n\r\nNext morning our young marooners endeavoured to make as early a start as\r\non the day before; but there being now more persons to go, each of whom\r\nhad some preparation to make; and besides that, encumbered by another\r\nclumsy float of logs, their arrival at the wreck was fully an hour\r\nlater.  Securing the two rafts to the vessel’s side, Robert and Harold\r\nclambered to the hole they had cut, by the help of a rope tied there for\r\nthe purpose; then making a slipknot at the end, they drew up Sam, Frank,\r\nand finally, Mary.  The new comers were so anxious to enter the vessel\r\nthat they could scarcely wait for the lighting of a candle, but slid at\r\nonce into the hold, and began rummaging by means of the imperfect light\r\ntransmitted through the scuttle.\r\n\r\nThe examination of the hold on the day before had been so thorough, that\r\nfew more discoveries of importance remained to be made; and the new\r\ncomers, burning with curiosity, begged to be conducted to the rooms\r\nbelow.  Entering the cabin, Mary and Frank were repelled by the\r\nunpleasant odour that, notwithstanding the former fumigation, still\r\ncontinued; but the smell was on this occasion mingled more with that of\r\nmud, and Robert managed by a quick allusion to the river slime, and the\r\nnauseous odour of the mangroves, to prevent Mary’s suspicion of the real\r\ncause.\r\n\r\n\"We burnt some sugar here, on yesterday,\" said he, \"but the tide has\r\nbeen up since, and we shall have to burn more.  Or stay--we can try\r\nsomething else.  I recollect hearing father say that burning coffee is\r\none of the best fumigators in the world.\"\r\n\r\nHe brought some coffee from the hold, and wrapping it in paper, tried to\r\nburn it, as he did the sugar; but it was not so easily ignited; and\r\nMary, in her impatience, took some sugar, and setting it on fire while\r\nhe was experimenting with the damp coffee, so thoroughly impregnated the\r\nroom with its fragrant fumes, that they were ready to begin their\r\nexamination.\r\n\r\nThe first thing they noticed on entering the cabin, was a handsome sofa\r\nand set of chairs.  Overhead, screwed fast to what had been the floor,\r\nwas an extension table, capable of seating from four to twelve persons.\r\nMary clapped her hands at this welcome sight, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n\"O, now we can sit and eat like decent people again!\"\r\n\r\nTo their right was a little room, with its door open. On entering it,\r\nthey saw a boy’s cap and pair of shoes. Frank pounced upon these, and\r\ntried them on, with several merry jests, to which the others made no\r\nreply, for the larger boys thought immediately of the little skeleton to\r\nwhich these had belonged.  A trunk was there too, perched upon the\r\nupturned bottom of what had been the lowest berth, containing the usual\r\nwardrobe of the boy; and beside it, the trunk and carpet bag of the\r\ngirl.  These last were locked.  On forcing them open, Mary found many of\r\nthe articles in a state of perfect preservation; though the linen and\r\ncotton were sadly mildewed, and almost spoiled.  She saw at a glance\r\nthat the silk dresses, and other parts of attire, were nearly all the\r\nsame size with her own.  But though greatly in need of clothing, and\r\nfitted almost exactly in what she found, she manifested more sadness\r\nthan pleasure at the sight; her mind reverted irresistibly to the former\r\nwearer, who was no doubt as fond of life as herself.\r\n\r\n\"Poor thing!\" she said, as tears came into her eyes, after turning over\r\nseveral articles, \"and her name was Mary, too.  See here, ’Marie De\r\nRosa,’ written so neatly on this white handkerchief.  What a beautiful\r\nname! I wish I knew her.\"\r\n\r\nFastened to the wall was a neat looking-glass, and beside it a handsome\r\nhair-brush, hung by a blue ribbon to a small brass knob; but the water\r\nhad dissolved the glue, and the rosewood veneering had separated from\r\nthe brush.  On the floor were two ivory combs, and the fragments of\r\npitcher, bason, and tumblers, lying with the towels.  In the berths were\r\ntwo hair mattresses, whose ticking was mouldy and mildewed, but they\r\nwere otherwise good; and in each, with the damp sheets, was a pair of\r\nblankets as good as new.\r\n\r\nNext to this room was another, whose door was jammed and swollen tight.\r\nForcing it open, they found two trunks and travelling bags, with various\r\narticles of male and female attire--a hat and pair of boots, a bonnet\r\nand rich shawl, the little boy’s boots and best cap, and the girl’s\r\nparasol and cloak; new evidences these, to the boys, to prove that the\r\nfour skeletons belonged to one family.  There were also several books,\r\nbut they were in Spanish, and so perfectly soaked and blackened as to be\r\nuseless, even had they been in their own language. The De Rosas were\r\nevidently a family of wealth and education.\r\n\r\nThe other rooms were furnished with the usual appendages of warlike men,\r\nand beside these there was little else to tell who or what they were.\r\nTheir papers and valuables were probably locked up in the iron chest, or\r\nleft behind where they had concealed their treasures.\r\n\r\nPassing from the cabin, their attention was arrested at the door by a\r\nsmall closet under the companion-way. Harold stood upon a stool and\r\nexamined it.  There were silver cups, of various figures, a basket of\r\nchampagne wine, and many bottles and decanters, or rather their\r\nfragments, which appeared to have held different kinds of liquors.\r\n\r\n\"Bah!\" said Harold, \"liquor in the hold--liquor in the rooms--liquor in\r\nthe closets--there is more liquor than anything else aboard, except guns\r\nand pistols.\"\r\n\r\n\"They naturally go together,\" responded Robert.  \"I suspect the poor\r\nfellows needed the liquor to fit them for their wicked works.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the cabin they went to the carpenter’s room. Sam decided in a\r\nmoment that he must have the grindstone, and the rest of the tools--they\r\nwere too good to be lost.  He also looked wistfully at the work-bench,\r\nwith the iron vice attached, and said he thought they could force it\r\nfrom the wall, and float it behind the rafts.  But the boys mistrusted\r\nhis partiality for tools, and decided that it was not so important as\r\nsome other things.\r\n\r\nNext to the carpenter’s room was another, into which they forced an\r\nentrance with the ax.  This was the gunner’s.  Here they found\r\ncartridges in abundance, of all sorts and sizes, bomb-shells, clusters\r\nof grape-shot, canisters of balls, a profusion of cannon shot of several\r\nsizes, and two small cannons of brass, with balls to suit. There were\r\nalso several large kegs of powder, but the powder appeared to be spoilt,\r\nfor the kegs were damp.\r\n\r\nWhen the time came to prepare for loading, the boys united with Sam to\r\nenlarge the scuttle.  They put upon one raft a keg of rice, and another\r\nof flour, the firkin of butter, two cheeses, six loaves of sugar, the\r\ngrindstone, the chest of tools, Sam’s box of tobacco, and more of the\r\nhams and beef.  On the other, they put the extension-table and leaves,\r\nsix chairs, the sofa, the trunks of the De Rosas, five mattresses, with\r\ntheir clothing, the looking-glass, &c.\r\n\r\nThe return voyage was made in all safety until they reached the landing;\r\nbut there occurred one of those misadventures that appear to come\r\noftenest in seasons of greatest security.\r\n\r\nAs the rafts neared the shore, Sam hobbled to the hindmost end, to look\r\nafter his darling tobacco, and having for some reason stooped as one\r\nraft struck the other in stopping, he lost his balance, and fell\r\nheadlong into the water.  No one knew of the accident, until hearing a\r\ngreat splutter, they looked around, and saw him blowing the water from\r\nhis nose and mouth, and wearing a most comical expression of surprise\r\nand fear. They ran, of course, to his assistance, but knowing him to be\r\na good swimmer, they apprehended no serious consequences, and were\r\nrather disposed to jest than to be alarmed.  But Sam, who had been\r\nalready strangling for a quarter of a minute, so as to be unable to\r\nutter a word, and who discerned at a glance that they did not apprehend\r\nhis situation, stretched out his hand imploringly, and gasped.\r\n\r\n\"He is drowning!\" exclaimed Harold.  \"Here, Robert, help me!\" then ran\r\nto obtain something buoyant, to which Sam might cling.  When he\r\nreturned, bringing with him a pair of oars (the nearest thing within\r\nreach), he saw his cousin, heedless of danger, and moved only by\r\nsympathy, swimming just over the place where Sam had sunk.\r\n\r\n\"Robert!  Robert!  COME AWAY!\" he called in a voice of thunder; \"he is\r\ntoo strong for you, and will drown you!\"\r\n\r\nRobert turned at this earnest and even imperative call, and began to\r\nswim back; but it was too late.  Sam rose within reach, grasped his arm,\r\ndrew him up close, pinioned him firmly, and again sunk out of sight.\r\nMary and Frank shrieked as they saw their brother go down, and Harold\r\nstood a moment, with clasped hands, exclaiming, \"My God!  What shall I\r\ndo?\"\r\n\r\nAt this moment an idea occurred to him.  Calling to Mary, \"Bring me that\r\nhat\" (it was De Rosa’s, and water-proof), he threw off his coat and\r\nvest, then spreading his handkerchief over the mouth of the hat, so that\r\nhe could grasp the corners under the crown, he plunged into the water,\r\nswimming with one hand, and holding the hat as a temporary life\r\npreserver with the other.  As he expected, Robert rose to the surface\r\nand grasped him. Harold did nothing at first but hold firmly to the hat\r\nto prevent his own sinking, and in that short interval Robert recovered\r\nsufficiently to know what he was about.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God for _you_, Robert!\" said Harold.  \"I was afraid you were\r\ngone; here, take the hat and swim to the raft, while I dive after Sam.\r\nHas he ceased struggling?\"  Robert replied, \"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nJoining his hands high over his head, Harold rose as far as he could\r\nfrom the water, and sank perpendicularly with his feet close together.\r\nHe succeeded in finding the body, but not in time to seize it, before he\r\nwas compelled to rise for the want of breath.  He came to the surface,\r\npanted for a quarter of a minute, then descended a second time, and rose\r\nwith the body. Robert reached him one of the oars, dragged him to the\r\nraft, and then to the shore.\r\n\r\nAnd now what was to be done?  Robert knew well that when a person has\r\nbeen under water four minutes and more it is exceedingly difficult to\r\nrestore life, and that whosoever would render aid must do it quickly.\r\nHis preparations were few and simple.\r\n\r\nBegging Mary and Frank to make a fire as soon as possible, and to heat\r\none of the blankets, he laid the body with the head lowest, to allow the\r\nwater to run from the mouth and throat, while he hastily unloosed the\r\nclothing.  Then laying the body with the head highest, as in sleep, he\r\nand Harold rubbed the skin with all their might, for the double purpose\r\nof removing the moisture and restoring the heat.\r\n\r\nThis friction was continued for several minutes, when Robert, requesting\r\nHarold to keep on, tried another means.  He inserted a reed into one of\r\nSam’s nostrils, which he pressed tightly around it, and closing also the\r\nother nostril and the mouth to prevent the egress of the air, he blew\r\nforcibly until he felt the chest rise, when, by a gentle pressure, he\r\nexpelled the air as in natural respiration.\r\n\r\nBy this time Mary and Frank had warmed one of the blankets brought from\r\nthe vessel.  This Robert wrapped closely around the body, and while Mary\r\nand Frank were engaged in warming still another, Harold greatly\r\nincreased the effectiveness of his friction by tearing a third blanket\r\ninto strips, and using the hot pieces as rubbers.\r\n\r\nPersisting for an hour in these simple means, the anxious company were\r\nat last rewarded by the signs of returning life.  Sam’s heart began to\r\nbeat softly, and shortly after he gave a sigh.  The boys were nearly\r\nexhausted by their protracted efforts, but still they kept on; and it\r\nwas well they did, for many a person has been lost by neglect after life\r\nseemed to have been restored. When the patient was sufficiently\r\nrecovered to swallow, Robert poured down his throat some warm water and\r\nsugar, remarking it was a pity they had brought none of the wines or\r\nspirits which were so abundant on shipboard.\r\n\r\n\"There is some in the box of tobacco,\" observed Frank.  \"I saw Sam put a\r\nbottle there; and when I asked him what it was, he said it was rum to\r\nrub on his weak leg.\"\r\n\r\nRobert and Harold exchanged a significant smile; for though Sam might\r\nhave intended only what he professed, they knew that he loved rum as\r\nwell as tobacco.  It was fortunate, however, that the spirits were\r\nthere, for it was the best stimulant they could administer.  Sam soon\r\nopened his eyes, and began to speak.  His first words, after looking\r\naround, were, \"Bless de Lord! Poor Sam here again!\"\r\n\r\nLeaving him now to recover slowly, the boys brought each a chair from\r\nthe raft, and sat down to rest.\r\n\r\n\"Why, Robert,\" said Harold, \"you seem to know by heart the whole rule\r\nfor restoring a drowned person.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not?  There is nothing mysterious in it?\"\r\n\r\n\"So it seems, and I wish you would teach it to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can do that in half a breath,\" replied Robert. \"In father’s words,\r\nall that you have to do, is to _restore the warmth and excite the\r\nrespiration_.\"\r\n\r\n\"That, certainly, is simple.\"\r\n\r\n\"Father always said,\" continued Robert, \"that he did not see why boys\r\nshould not all be taught how to help one another on such occasions.\r\n’Send for a doctor,’ he said to me, ’but don’t wait for him.  Go to work\r\nat once before life is gone.  If you can do nothing else strip off the\r\nwet clothes, and rub, rub, RUB, and blow into the lungs.  Start the\r\nbreath, and you will start the blood, or start the blood, and that will\r\nstart the breath, for each comes with the other.  Apply heat\r\ninwardly--outwardly by friction, by clothing, by fire, by hot bottles,\r\nby sand-bags, by any means, and keep trying for hours.’  That is the\r\nrule.\"\r\n\r\n\"A good one it is,\" said Harold.  \"But it is a pity your father did not\r\ngive you some rule also about keeping out of the way of drowning people\r\nso that you might put your knowledge to some use, instead of getting\r\ndrowned yourself.\"\r\n\r\n\"He did,\" replied Robert, laughing, \"but I forgot it.  It was\r\nexceedingly thoughtless in me to do as I did.  However, I tried to make\r\nup for it in another way; for after Sam had pinioned my arms, I made no\r\neffort whatever, except to take a long breath, and retain my presence of\r\nmind.  When we were going down, I learned exactly what kind of a grip he\r\nhad taken, and by the time we reached bottom, I had drawn up my knees,\r\nand put my feet against the pit of his stomach.  When that was done I\r\nfelt safe, for I knew that my legs were stronger than his arms, and that\r\nI could break his hold. But what did you intend to do when you called me\r\nto help you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I had no exact plan,\" Harold answered, \"except to keep you from putting\r\nyourself in danger, and then to throw or reach Sam something by which to\r\nhelp himself.  I had seen drowning people before, and knew very well\r\nthat unless you had something to prevent your own sinking, as I had when\r\nyou seized me, or unless you were strong enough (as in this case you\r\nwere not) to hold him at arm’s length, he would be almost sure to drown\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nThis untoward accident delayed the work of transportation until near\r\ndark, and then it was only the lighter and more necessary articles that\r\nthey carried. Sam gradually recovered, and about dusk, supported by the\r\nboys, he staggered slowly to the tent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSEHOLD ARRANGEMENTS--THIRD VISIT TO THE WRECK--RAINY\r\nWEATHER--AGREEMENT ABOUT WORK--MARY IN GREAT DANGER--EXTINGUISHING FIRE\r\nON ONE’S DRESS--RELIEF TO A BURN--CONVERSATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThey did not return to the vessel the next day. The work of transporting\r\nthe many heavy articles brought, and of giving them accommodation,\r\noccupied the whole day.  Indeed, the work of arranging was by no means\r\neasy, for their possessions were now too large for their dwelling.  They\r\nwere therefore compelled to make a new room for Sam and his tools, by\r\nmeans of some spare sails brought from the wreck; and this led them to\r\nthink of erecting still another wing to the tent, as a place of deposit\r\nfor their stores of provision.\r\n\r\nBy Thursday the return tide came at so late an hour in the afternoon,\r\nthat the boys were loth to go upon the third trip; but there were\r\nseveral other articles of importance that they needed, and intending to\r\nmake a short visit, they did not start until near mid-day.  On entering\r\nthe vessel their first work was to remove the stove; which being quite\r\nnew and recently put up, they had no difficulty in taking to pieces, and\r\nlowering, with its appurtenances, into the raft.  The work-bench they\r\ndetached, with great labour, from the wall, and tumbled it over the\r\nvessel’s side.  From the carpenter’s room they carried several sails,\r\ntwo coils of small rope, and a hank of twine.  The magazine they did not\r\ncare to enter.  Most of the powder in the gunner’s room was wet, but\r\nthere were two large kegs of cannon powder, the outside of which was\r\ncaked and ruined, while the central part was perfectly good, and also a\r\nfive pound canister of superfine rifle powder, which was so tightly\r\nsealed that not a particle of damp had entered.  These they took.  And\r\ndragging out one of the small cannon they managed, after hard work, to\r\nlower it, with its appropriate carriage, into the raft, and deposited\r\nalong with it several dozen balls, and as many canisters to fit the\r\nbore.  These, together with the trunks and clothing of the officers, the\r\niron vice, a small kit of mackerel, and the box of cocoanuts,\r\nconstituted their load.  The voyage back was made without accident.\r\n\r\nOn landing, their first business was to shelter their powder, for the\r\nsky was clouding fast, with long blue belts, that promised rain before\r\nmorning, and the night was rapidly coming on.  Unwilling to keep so\r\ndangerous a quantity of powder in the tent, they divided it into several\r\nparcels, and concealed them in hollow trees, which they closed and\r\nmarked.\r\n\r\nThe cannon carriage proved a great convenience in transporting the\r\ntrunks, the disjointed parts of the stove, and other heavy articles to\r\nthe tent.  But even with this assistance they did not complete their\r\nwork before the night set in.\r\n\r\nThe next day was wet--wet--wet.  The young people continued within\r\ndoors, made a particular examination of the trunks, and divided among\r\nthemselves the articles that were serviceable.  With these employments,\r\nand the fitting up of their stove, they spent all that day, and part of\r\nthe next.\r\n\r\nIt was during that evening, as they sat listening to the incessant\r\npatter of the rain upon the canvas roof, that the boys conceived and\r\nresolved upon a species of competition, that gave a steady progression\r\nto their work from that time forward.\r\n\r\n\"Tomorrow is New Year’s Day,\" observed Harold. \"We have been two months\r\nand a half upon the island. Our first boat is not a quarter finished.\r\nWhy, Robert, it will be six months before we get away by our own\r\nexertions; and then your father will have left Bellevue.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you forget how many interruptions we have had,\" replied Robert.\r\n\"First, there was Sam’s misfortune, then yours; after that, our removal\r\nto the prairie, and securing the tent; then this discovery of the wreck,\r\nwhich has furnished us with food and tools for continuing our work\r\nwithout interruption.  If I am not mistaken, the end of January will see\r\nus at Bellevue, or on our way there.  What do you think, Sam--can we\r\nfinish our two boats in a month?\"\r\n\r\n\"May be so, massa, if we work mighty hard; but it will take a heap o’\r\nwork.\"\r\n\r\n\"I doubt if we finish them in two months, work as we may,\" remarked\r\nHarold.\r\n\r\nRobert was not pleased with this discouraging assertion, though he was\r\nstartled to find that the usual prudent Harold entertained such an\r\nopinion.\r\n\r\n\"Now, cousin,\" said he, \"I will put this matter to the test.  As we boys\r\nused to say, I’ll make a bargain with you.  We shall all work on the\r\nsecond boat, until it is as far advanced as the present one.  Then we\r\nshall each take a boat and work.  Sam shall divide his time between us.\r\nAnd if at the end of a month we are not ready to return home, I’ll give\r\nup that I am mistaken.\"\r\n\r\n\"Give me your hand to that bargain,\" said Harold. \"You shall not beat me\r\nworking, if I can help it; but if, with all our efforts, we leave this\r\nisland before the last day of February, I will give up that _I_ am\r\nmistaken.\"\r\n\r\nFaithful to this agreement, the boys went next morning to the landing,\r\nand brought the various parts of the work-bench, which they aided Sam in\r\nfitting up. The grindstone also they set upon its necessary fixtures;\r\nand collecting the various tools that were in need of grinding, they\r\npersisted in relieving each other at the crank, until they had sharpened\r\ntwo very dull axes, two adzes, three chisels, a broad ax, and a drawing\r\nknife, and stowed them safely under Sam’s shelter.\r\n\r\nThe history of the day, however, was not concluded without an incident\r\nof a very serious character, in which Mary was the principal, though\r\nunwilling actress; and in which, but for her presence of mind, she would\r\nhave met with a painful and terrible death.\r\n\r\nAbout ten o’clock that night she retired to her room, undressed, and was\r\nlaying aside the articles of dress necessary for the next morning, when,\r\nturning around, her night clothes touched the flame of the candle,\r\nwhich, for the want of a table, she had set upon the floor.  The next\r\ninstant she extinguished the candle, and was about stepping into bed,\r\nwhen her attention was excited by a dim light shining behind her, and a\r\nslight roar, that increased as the flame ran up her back.  Giving a\r\nscream of terror, she was on the point of rushing into the next room for\r\nhelp, when recollecting the repeated and earnest injunctions of her\r\nfather, she threw herself flat upon the blanket of the bed, and wrapping\r\nit tightly round her, rolled over and over upon the floor, calling for\r\nhelp. The flame was almost instantly quenched, as it probably would have\r\nbeen, even without a blanket, had she only sat down instantly on the\r\nfloor, and folded the other part of her dress tightly over the flame.[#]\r\n\r\n\r\n[#] _Flame ascends_.  All have observed how much more rapidly it\r\nconsumes a sheet of paper held with the burning end down, than the same\r\nsheet laid on the table.  So with a female’s dress; an erect posture\r\nallows the flame to run almost instantly over the whole person.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut though the _flame_ was extinguished, the charred ends of the dress\r\nwere not; they kept on burning, and coming into contact with the naked\r\nskin, made her scream with pain.  The agony was so great, that again she\r\nwas almost tempted to throw off the blanket and rush into the open air,\r\nbut knowing that this would certainly increase the fire, and perhaps\r\nrenew the blaze, she drew the blanket more tightly around her, and\r\nrolled over, calling to Robert, who had by this time come to her\r\nassistance.  \"Pour on water--_water_--WATER!\"  Robert did his best--he\r\nfumbled about for the pitcher, then finding it, asked where the water\r\nwas to be poured; but now that the water was ready to be thrown upon\r\nher, Mary felt secure; she cast off the blanket, and the remaining fire\r\nwas put out by the application of Robert’s wet hand.\r\n\r\nThe time occupied by this terrifying scene was scarcely a minute and a\r\nhalf, yet Mary’s night dress was consumed nearly to her shoulders, and\r\nher lower limbs were badly scorched.  So rapid an agent is fire.\r\nWhoever would escape destruction from a burning dress, must work fast,\r\nwith good judgment and a strong resolution.\r\n\r\nMary’s burns were slight in comparison with what they might have been.\r\nThe skin was reddened for a foot or more along each limb; but it was\r\nbroken only in two places, about as wide and long as her two fingers.\r\nStill the pain was excessive, and she wept and groaned a great deal.\r\nRobert applied cold water for a number of minutes, and would have\r\ncontinued it longer, but Mary at last said:\r\n\r\n\"Bring me a cup full of flour.  I have tried it on a burnt finger, and\r\nyou can scarcely imagine how cooling it is.\"\r\n\r\nThe flour was brought, and applied by means of handkerchiefs tied over\r\nthe raw and blistered parts. Its effect was to form a sort of artificial\r\ncuticle over those spots where the skin had been removed; and the soft\r\nand cool sensation it produced in the other parts was delightful.  Still\r\nMary appeared to suffer so much, that Robert administered an opiate, as\r\nhe did in the case of Sam, and after that he heard no more from her\r\nuntil next morning.\r\n\r\n\"What a quick, brave girl she is!\" said Harold, after Robert had\r\ndescribed the scene.  \"Most girls would have rushed into the open air,\r\nand been burned to death.\"\r\n\r\n\"She showed great presence of mind,\" Robert assented.\r\n\r\n\"More than that,\" said Harold, \"she showed great _resolution_.  I knew a\r\nbeautiful girl at school, who had presence of mind enough to wrap\r\nherself in the hearth rug, but who could not stand the pain of the fire;\r\nshe threw off the rug, rushed into the open air, screaming for help, and\r\nwas burnt to death in less than two minutes.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Mary came from her room next morning her eyes were dull and glassy,\r\nfrom the effects of the medicine, and she had no appetite for more than\r\na cup of coffee.  The others met her with more than their usual\r\naffection.  Her accident had revealed to them how much they loved her;\r\nand her coolness in danger, and fortitude in suffering, had given them a\r\ngreater respect for her character.\r\n\r\n\"We do sincerely thank God, on your account, cousin,\" said Harold, as\r\nsoon as they were left alone that Sabbath morning.  \"It is so seldom a\r\nperson meets with such an accident, without being seriously injured.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope I feel thankful, too,\" returned Mary.  \"I could not help\r\nthinking last night, before going to sleep, how uncertain life is.  O, I\r\ndo wish I were a Christian, as I believe you to be, cousin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed, if I am a Christian at all, I wish you were a far better one,\"\r\nhe replied.  \"I have neither felt nor acted as I desired, or supposed I\r\nshould.\"\r\n\r\n\"But still you feel and act very differently from us.\"\r\n\r\n\"My feelings are certainly very different from what they used to be, and\r\nI thank God that they are.  Yet the only particular thing which I\r\nrecollect of myself, at the time that I began to feel differently, is\r\nthat I was troubled on account of my past life, and wished heartily to\r\nserve God.  To judge from myself, then, I should say that to _desire to\r\nserve God_, is to be a Christian.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, I do desire,\" said Mary, weeping.  \"I do, with all my heart.  But I\r\nknow I am not what I ought to be.  I do not love God; I do not trust\r\nhim; I do not feel troubled for sin, as I ought to be; and I have no\r\nreason to think that my sins are forgiven.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am a poor preacher, Mary,\" Harold said, with strong emotion; \"for I\r\nnever knew anything of these feelings myself, until lately.  But this I\r\ncan say, that if you will heartily give yourself to God, to be his\r\nservant for ever, and put your trust in his promises, you will be\r\naccepted.  Did not Jesus Christ come into this world to save sinners,\r\neven the chief?  Does he not say, ’Him that cometh to me, I will in\r\nnowise cast out’? Now what does the Bible mean, but to encourage all who\r\nfeel as you do?\"\r\n\r\nMary did not reply; the tears burst through her fingers, and dropped\r\ninto her lap.  Harold continued,\r\n\r\n\"Ever since we came to the island I felt as you feel, until the Sabbath\r\nwhen I knelt down in the woods, and gave myself to the Lord.  My heart\r\nwas very heavy; I knew that I was a sinner needing forgiveness, and that\r\nI had nothing that I could offer as pay; but I read where God offers\r\nsalvation ’without money and without price,’ and again where he says we\r\nmust ’believe on him.’  Well, after all that, I could not help\r\nbelieving; it was sweet to pray--sweet to think of God--sweet to read\r\nthe Bible--sweet to do whatever was pleasing to Him.  I hope it will be\r\nso always; and I long for the time when I can return to Bellevue to talk\r\nwith your father about these things.  Now, cousin, I advise you to try\r\nthe same plan.\"\r\n\r\nHe marked several passages of Scripture for her to read; then walked\r\ninto the woods, where he prayed that the Lord would direct her, so as to\r\nfind peace by believing in Jesus Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nSUCCESSFUL WORK--EXCURSION--THE FISH-EAGLE--DIFFERENT METHODS OF\r\nPROCURING FIRE--WOODSMAN’S SHELTER AGAINST RAIN AND HAIL--NOVEL REFUGE\r\nFROM FALLING TREES\r\n\r\n\r\nMonday morning found the labourers moving at the dawn of day.  Sam was\r\ncook, and fulfilled his office with unexpected ability.  His corn-bread\r\nwas delightful; no one but a negro knows how to make it.\r\n\r\nThe tools were in excellent order, and the boys commenced work in fine\r\nspirits.  At Harold’s suggestion they resolved to work very leisurely\r\nthat day and the next, as being the surest way to attain expedition in\r\nthe end.  Said he,\r\n\r\n\"My father was a great manager of horses, and sometimes made tremendous\r\njourneys.  But his rule was always to begin a long journey very\r\nmoderately.  He used to say, ’If you strain a horse at the first, he\r\nwill move heavily all the way through, but if you spare him at first, he\r\nwill become gradually accustomed to the strain, and be able to push on\r\nfaster at the end than at the beginning of the journey!’  Now, as we are\r\nthe horses, I think we had better make very moderate journeys today and\r\ntomorrow.\"\r\n\r\nRobert was much pleased with the rule.  Notwithstanding his boast, he\r\nhad shuddered at the idea of blistered hands and weary limbs; but this\r\nplan enabled him to anticipate fresh feelings, and even increasing\r\nlabour, so long as they chose to work.\r\n\r\nIn the course of four days the second tree was cut, hewed, and excavated\r\nto the exact shape and size of the first.  They then drew for choices,\r\nand separated, each working on his own boat, within hearing of the\r\nother’s ax and mallet.  One reason, perhaps, of the increased rapidity\r\nof their work, was a lesson which they learned of employing every moment\r\nto advantage, and of resting themselves by a mere change of work.  For\r\ninstance, when weary of the adze they would resort to the mallet and\r\nchisel, the auger, ax, or drawing-knife, and this was to some extent a\r\nreal rest, for fresh muscles were brought into play while the wearied\r\nones were relieved.\r\n\r\nBy Friday, however, their whole bodies began to feel the effects of\r\nfatigue; and Harold proposed, that for that day their arms should be\r\nentirely relieved from labour, and that they should search the woods for\r\ntimber suitable for masts, yards, and oars.  They, therefore, took their\r\nguns and hatchets, and went first to the orange landing, where they saw\r\ntheir old raft lying as they had left it exactly a month before.\r\nPassing thence to the place which they had dubbed \"Duck Point,\" they\r\nproceeded along the beach towards their old encampment, and thence home.\r\nThis was their route; but it was marked by such a variety of useful\r\nexpedients, that we must stop to describe them.\r\n\r\nWhile Robert was engaged for a few minutes in searching a little grove,\r\nHarold saw a fish eagle plunge into the water, and bring out a trout so\r\nlarge that it could scarcely fly with it to the shore.  Harold was\r\nhungry; his appetite at breakfast had not allowed him to eat at all.\r\nNow it began to crave, and the sight of that rich looking fish whetted\r\nit, keenly.  He ran towards the eagle, crying out,\r\n\r\n\"I’ll divide with you, old gentleman, if you please; that is too much\r\nfor one.\"\r\n\r\nThe eagle, however, appeared to dissent from the proposal, and tried\r\nhard to carry its prey into a tree, but apprehensive of being itself\r\ncaught before it could rise beyond reach, it dropped the fish, and\r\nflying to a neighbouring tree, watched patiently to see what share its\r\nhuman robber was disposed to leave.\r\n\r\nA fish is easily enough cooked, if a person has fire; but in this case\r\nthere was none, and what was worse, no apparent means of producing it,\r\nfor their matches were left behind, and the wadding of their guns was\r\nnot of a kind to receive and hold fire from the powder.\r\n\r\n\"Lend me your watch a minute,\" said Robert, on learning what was wanted.\r\n\"It is possible that I may obtain from it what you wish.\"\r\n\r\nHad Robert spoken of some chemical combination for producing fire, by\r\nmixing sand and sea-water, Harold could scarcely have been more\r\nsurprised than by the proposal to obtain fire from his watch.  He handed\r\nit to his cousin with the simple remark, \"Please don’t hurt it,\" and\r\nlooked on with curiosity.  Robert examined the convex surface of the\r\ncrystal, which being old fashioned, was almost the section of a sphere,\r\nand said,\r\n\r\n\"I think it will do.\"\r\n\r\nThen obtaining some dry, rotten wood from a decayed tree, he filled the\r\nhollow part of the crystal with water, and setting it upon a support,\r\nfor the purpose of keeping the water perfectly steady, showed Harold\r\nthat the rays of the sun passing through this temporary lens, were\r\nconcentrated as by a sun-glass.  The tinder smoked, and seemed almost\r\nready to ignite, but did not quite--the sun’s rays were too much aslant\r\nat that hour of the day, and the sky was moreover covered with a thin\r\nfilm of mist.\r\n\r\n\"It is a failure,\" said he, \"but still there is another plan which I\r\nhave seen adopted--a spark of fire _squeezed from the air_ by suddenly\r\ncompressing it in a syringe. If we had a dry reed, the size of this gun\r\nbarrel, I would try it by using a tight plug of gun wadding as a\r\npiston.\"\r\n\r\nBut Robert had no opportunity for trying his philosophical experiment,\r\nand being mortified by a second disappointment, as he probably would\r\nhave been, from the rudeness of the contrivance; for Harold’s voice was\r\nsoon heard from the bank above, \"I have it now!\" and when Robert\r\napproached he saw in his hand a white flint arrowhead.  With this old\r\nIndian relic he showered a plentiful supply of sparks upon the dry\r\ntouch-wood, until a rising smoke proclaimed that the fire had taken.\r\n\r\nDuring the time occupied by these experiments, and the subsequent\r\ncookery, the thin mist in the sky had given place to several dark\r\nrolling clouds, which promised ere long to give them a shower.  The\r\npromise was kept; for the boys had not proceeded half a mile before the\r\nrain poured down in torrents.  As there was no lightning, they sought\r\nthe shelter of a mossy tree, and for a season were so well protected\r\nthat they could not but admire their good fortune.  But their admiration\r\ndid not last long; the rain soaked through the dense masses over head,\r\nand fell in heavy drops upon their caps and shoulders.\r\n\r\n\"This will never do,\" cried Harold.  \"Come with me, Robert, and I will\r\nprovide a shelter that we can trust.\"\r\n\r\nPutting upon their heads a thick covering of moss, which hung like a\r\ncape as far down as their elbows, they ran to a fallen pine, and\r\nloosened several pieces of its bark, as long and broad as they could\r\ndetach, then placing them upon their heads above the moss, marched back\r\nto the tree, and had the pleasure of seeing the rain drip from their\r\nbark shelters as from the eaves of a house.  Robert was much pleased\r\nwith the expedient, and remarked,\r\n\r\n\"I suppose this is another of old Torgah’s notions.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, no,\" replied Harold.  \"I have frequently seen it used by negroes in\r\nthe field, and by hunters in the woods.  But there is another device of\r\na similar kind, which I will leave you to guess.  I was riding once with\r\na rough backwoodsman across one of our Alabama prairies, when we were\r\novertaken by a severe hail-storm, that gave us an unmerciful pelting.\r\nNow, how do you suppose he protected himself against the hailstones?\"\r\n\r\n\"Got under his horse,\" conjectured Robert.  \"I once saw a person\r\nsheltering himself under his wagon.\"\r\n\r\n\"He took the _saddle_ from his horse, and placed it upon his head.  For\r\nmy own part, I preferred the pelting of the stones to the smell of the\r\nsaddle.\"\r\n\r\nThe rain ceasing shortly after, they continued their walk to the old\r\nencampment, which they visited for the purpose of ascertaining whether\r\nthere were any other signs of visitors.  Everything was just as they had\r\nleft it, except that it had assumed a desolate and weather-beaten\r\naspect.  Their flag was flying, and the paper, though wet, adhering to\r\nthe staff.  At sea the weather looked foul, and the surf was rolling\r\nangrily upon the shore.  Resting themselves upon the root of the noble\r\nold oak, and visiting the spring for a drink of cool water, they once\r\nmore turned their faces to the prairie.\r\n\r\nWhoever will travel extensively through our pine barrens, will see\r\ntracts, varying in extent from a quarter of an acre to many hundreds of\r\nacres, destroyed by the attacks of a worm.  The path from the old\r\nencampment led through a \"deadening,\" as it is called, of this sort; in\r\nwhich the trees, having been attacked some years before, were many of\r\nthem prostrate, and others standing only by sufferance of the winds.  By\r\nthe time our travellers reached the middle of this dangerous tract, a\r\nsudden squall came up from sea, and roared through the forest at a\r\nterrible rate.  They heard it from afar, and saw the distant limbs\r\nbending, breaking, and interlocking, while all around them was a\r\nwilderness of slender, brittle trunks, from which they had not time to\r\nescape.  Their situation was appalling.  Death seemed almost inevitable.\r\nBut just as the crash commenced among the pines, a brilliant idea\r\noccurred to the mind of Robert.\r\n\r\n\"Here, Harold!\" said he.  \"Run! run! run!\"\r\n\r\nSuiting the action to the word, he threw himself flat beside a large\r\nsound log that lay _across the course of the wind_, and crouched closely\r\nbeside its curvature; almost too closely, as he afterwards discovered.\r\nHardly had Harold time to follow his example, before an enormous tree\r\ncracked, crashed, and came with a horrible roar, directly over the place\r\nwhere they lay.  The log by the side of which they had taken refuge, was\r\nburied several inches in the ground; and when Robert tried to move, he\r\nfound that his coat had been caught by a projecting knot, and partly\r\nburied.  The tree which fell was broken into four parts; two of them\r\nresting with their fractured ends butting each other on the log, while\r\ntheir other ends rested at ten or twelve feet distance upon the earth.\r\nFor five minutes the winds roared, and the trees crashed around them;\r\nand then the squall subsided as quickly as it had arisen.\r\n\r\n\"That was awful,\" said Robert, rising and looking at the enormous tree,\r\nfrom whose crushing fall they had been so happily protected.\r\n\r\n\"It was, indeed,\" Harold responded; \"and we owe our lives, under God, to\r\nthat happy thought of yours. Where did you obtain it?\"\r\n\r\nRobert pointed to the other end of the log, and said, \"There.\"  A small\r\ntree had fallen across it, and was broken, as the larger one had been.\r\n\"I saw that,\" said he, \"just as the wind began to crash among these\r\npines, and thought that if we laid ourselves where we did, we should be\r\nsafe from everything, except straggling limbs, or flying splinters.\"\r\n\r\n\"Really,\" said Harold, \"at this rate you are likely to beat me in my own\r\nprovince.  I wonder I never thought of this plan before.\"\r\n\r\n\"I had an adventure somewhat like this last year, only not a quarter so\r\nbad,\" said Robert.  \"I was fishing with Frank, on a small stream, when a\r\nwhirlwind came roaring along, with such force as to break off limbs from\r\nseveral of the trees.  Afraid that we, and particularly Frank, who was\r\nlight, might be taken up and carried away, or else dashed against a tree\r\nand seriously hurt, I made him grasp a sapling, by putting around it\r\nboth arms and legs, while I threw my own arms around him and it\r\ntogether, to hold all tight.  I was badly frightened at the noise and\r\nnear approach of the whirlwind, but for the life of me could not help\r\nlaughing at an act of Frank’s.  We had taken only a few small catfish\r\n(which he called from their size, _kitten_-fish), and two of these being\r\nthe first he had ever caught, he of course thought much of them.  When\r\nthe wind came nearest, and I called to him, ’Hold fast, Frank!’  I saw\r\nhim lean his head to one side, looking first at the flying branches,\r\nthen at the string of fish, which the wind had slightly moved, and\r\ndeliberately letting go his hold of the tree, he grasped his prize, and\r\nheld to that with an air and manner, which said as plainly as an act\r\ncould say, ’If you get them, you must take me too.’\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\n\r\nLAUNCHING THE BOATS--MORE WORK, AND YET MORE--ECLIPSE OF FEB. 12TH,\r\n1831--HEALING BY \"FIRST INTENTION\"--FRANK’S BIRTHDAY--PREPARING FOR A\r\nVOYAGE--RAIN, RAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boats came on swimmingly.  By the end of the second week of their\r\nsystematic labours they had not only been sufficiently excavated, but\r\nthe young shipwrights had trimmed down much of the exterior.  They were\r\ntwo and a half feet wide, by twenty inches deep, and eighteen feet long.\r\nAt this stage Robert supposed the work to be nearly done, but Sam shook\r\nhis head, and said, \"Not half.\"  The most laborious part of the work was\r\nover, but so much more remained, in the way of paring, smoothing,\r\ntrimming, and bringing into proper shape, that it was full a fortnight\r\nbefore they were considered fit for the water.\r\n\r\nThey were ready for launching on the same day; and though Robert made\r\nhis announcement of the fact some hours in the advance of Harold, it was\r\nagreed, that as Sam had been with him half a day more, the race should\r\nbe considered as even.  The launching occupied four days.  They were\r\ndistant from the water respectively an hundred and an hundred and fifty\r\npaces.  A thick forest was to be traversed.  It was necessary to clear a\r\nroad, build bridges, and cut down the river bank. Robert’s was launched\r\non February 1st, and Harold’s on February 3d.  On each occasion there\r\nwas a general rejoicing, and every person, not excepting Mary and Frank,\r\nfired a salute.\r\n\r\nBut on being launched the boats did not float to please them.  One was\r\ntoo heavy at the bows, the other leaned too much to one side.  Several\r\ndays were spent in correcting these irregularities, and thus closed the\r\nfifth week of their labour.\r\n\r\nAnother week was spent in making the rudders and a pair of oars, and\r\nfitting in the seats and masts.  This caused them to make another voyage\r\nto the wreck, for the purpose of obtaining planks, screws, and other\r\nmaterials.  They went, of course, in their boats, and had the pleasure\r\nof seeing them behave admirably.  They were steady, sat well on the\r\nwater, and obeyed the oars and helm almost as well as though they had\r\nbeen built in a shipyard.\r\n\r\nThere were two incidents worthy of note occurring about this time.  One\r\nwas the discovery, made first by Frank, of an interesting astronomical\r\nphenomenon. About a quarter before twelve o’clock he had gone to the\r\nwater bucket beside the door for a drink of water, when all at once Mary\r\nheard him call out,\r\n\r\n\"Run here, sister, run!  The sun has turned into a moon!\"\r\n\r\nHe had looked into the water, and seeing the reflected image of the sun\r\nlike a half moon, sharply horned, had strained his eyes by looking up\r\nuntil he ascertained that the sun itself was of the same shape.  Mary,\r\nwho had witnessed an event of the kind before, perceived at a glance\r\nthat it was an eclipse.  She therefore took a basin, and hurried with\r\nFrank to the landing, to inform the others of the fact.\r\n\r\n\"Look in the _water_, brother,\" said Frank, whose eyes were yet watery\r\nfrom the severe trial he had given them.  \"You can’t look at the sun\r\nwithout crying.\"\r\n\r\nFor a time, of course, no work was done; all were engaged in watching\r\nthe phenomenon.  It was the great annular eclipse of February 12th,\r\n1831, in which the sun appeared at many places like a narrow ring of\r\nlight around the dark body of the moon.  To our young people there was\r\nno ring.  They were too far south. The sun appeared like the moon when\r\ntwo days old, and the sky and earth were very gloomy.\r\n\r\nThe other incident was in itself trivial, and would not be introduced\r\nhere but that the fact it illustrates is sometimes of real importance.\r\nIt was simply the healing of a wound by what is called \"_first\r\nintention_.\"  Mary was engaged in some of her culinary duties, when, by\r\nan unfortunate slip of her hand, the knife which she was using missed\r\nits place, and sliced her finger. The piece was not cut _off_, but there\r\nwas a large gash, and it bled profusely.  Her first act was to wash the\r\nwound well in tepid water until the blood ceased to flow; then seeing\r\nthat all the clots were removed, she brought the lips of the wound\r\ntogether, and kept them so by a bandage and a little case, like the\r\nfinger of a glove made fast to the wrist by a piece of tape.  The wound\r\nsoon underwent a process similar to that of trees in grafting, only far\r\nmore rapid.  By the next morning the lips began to adhere, and in the\r\ncourse of three days the wound was healed--so rapidly will the flesh of\r\na healthy person recover from a cut if the conditions necessary to\r\n\"first intention\" are observed, viz., that the parts be _brought quickly\r\ntogether, and kept without disturbance_.\r\n\r\nThe next week was spent in fitting up the sails and rigging, and\r\npreparing the boats, so that in case of rough weather they could be\r\nfirmly lashed together.\r\n\r\nTheir work was now done.  They had been labouring steadily for a month\r\nand a half, and were ready by Friday evening to pack up and start for\r\nhome.  But they resolved to wait and sanctify the Sabbath.  They needed\r\nrest: they were jaded in every limb and muscle.  Moreover, the next day\r\nwas Frank’s birthday.  Taking everything into consideration, they\r\npreferred to spend that day in rest and rejoicing, partly in honour of\r\nFrank, but more especially as a sort of thanksgiving for their\r\nsuccessful work.  And as the voyage home promised to be long, and\r\nperhaps perilous, they also determined that they would devote Monday to\r\ntrying their boats at sea, by an outward voyage round the island.\r\n\r\nAfter Frank had retired, the rest agreed upon the plans by which to make\r\nthe following day pleasant and profitable to him.\r\n\r\n\"I,\" said Mary, \"will make him a birth-day cake.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" said Robert, \"will teach him how to shoot a bird.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" said Harold, \"will teach him how to swim.\"\r\n\r\n\"And I,\" said Sam, \"will sing him a corn song.\"\r\n\r\nThey went to bed and slept soundly.  It is astonishing how habit can\r\nreconcile us to our necessities!  Had these young people been set down\r\nby any accident, a few months before, in the midst of a lonely prairie,\r\nsurrounded by a wild forest, full of bears and panthers, afar from their\r\nfriends, and without any other protection than that which they had long\r\nenjoyed, they would have been miserable.  But they went to sleep that\r\nnight, not only free from painful apprehension, but happy--yes, actually\r\n_happy_--when they knew that their nearest neighbours were treacherous\r\nsavages, and that they were surrounded nightly by fierce beasts, from\r\nwhose devouring jaws they had already escaped more than once, only by\r\nthe blessing of God upon brave hearts and steady hands.  How came this\r\nchange?  It was by cheerful habit.  _The labours, dangers, and exposure\r\nof men, had given them the hearts of men_.  God bless the children! They\r\nslept in the midst of that leafy forest as sweetly as though they were\r\nat home, and the bright stars that rose by turns to measure out the\r\nnight, looked down like so many angel eyes, to watch the place of their\r\nhabitation.\r\n\r\nMary and Frank were the first to awake in the morning. The others,\r\nwearied by their long labours, and free from pressing responsibility,\r\nabandoned themselves to a repose as sweet as it was needful.  Frank\r\nmoved first, and his moving awaked Mary, who, on calling to mind the\r\nnature of the day, and the resolutions of the night before, put her arms\r\naffectionately round his neck, and said, \"Good morning, Mr.\r\nEight-years-old; I wish you many pleasant birthdays.\"\r\n\r\nFrank put his arms round her neck, also, and kissed her; then both began\r\nto dress.  Wishing not to disturb the sleepers, they slipped softly from\r\nthe tent.  Mary went first to the poultry-pen, which she opened.  The\r\nducks quacked with pleasure at her approach, and she watched them as\r\nthey dodged through the narrow hole opened for their passage, and ran in\r\na long line with shaking tails and patting feet after the leading drake.\r\nThen she raised the portcullis-like gate for the goats and deer; Nanny\r\nbleated, no doubt intending to say \"good morning,\" but the unmannerly\r\nkid and fawn pranced away, mindful of nothing but their expected feast\r\nof grass and leaves.\r\n\r\nWhile Mary was engaged with these, Frank went to look after his own\r\nparticular pets.  She heard him at the back of Nanny’s pen, where the\r\ncubs were kept, calling out, \"Come along, sir!\" then he laughed\r\nheartily, but a moment after his voice sounded impatiently, \"Quit it,\r\nyou Pollux! quit it, sir!\" then in a distressed tone, \"Sister, sister,\r\ncome help me!\"  Mary ran to his assistance, yet she could scarce\r\nrestrain her risibles at the sight which greeted her eyes.  Frank had\r\nloosed the cord which confined the cubs, and was leading them out for\r\nthe purpose of a romp, when Pollux, who was a saucy fellow, and knew as\r\nwell as his young master what was intended, rose, with a playful growl,\r\nupon his hind legs, and walking behind him, pinioned his arms close, and\r\nbegan trying to throw him down.  Frank was much pleased with what he\r\nregarded as a cunning trick in his young scholar; but he soon found that\r\nit was by no means pleasant to be hugged in that way by a bear.  He\r\ntried in vain to break loose, and when Mary came to his assistance, the\r\nbear had thrown him down, with his face and nose in the dirt.  Frank\r\nrose, looking very much mortified, and more than half angry.\r\n\r\n\"You ugly beast,\" he said to the bear, that seemed amazingly to enjoy\r\nthe joke, and was rising for another frolic.  \"Get out, sir.  I have a\r\ngreat mind to give you a beating.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, no, Frank,\" said Mary, \"don’t be angry with your playmate.  Remember\r\nwho taught him to wrestle, and remember besides that this is your\r\nbirthday.\"\r\n\r\nFrank’s wrath instantly subsided, and jerking down Pollux by the cord,\r\nhe led both cubs back to the pen, where he secured them, and then washed\r\nfrom his face the traces of his defeat.\r\n\r\nSam had by this time come from his shed-room and made the fire for\r\nbreakfast, and Robert and Harold, awaked by Frank’s call for help,\r\ndressed themselves and made their appearance.  They all wished Frank a\r\npleasant birthday, and hoped he might have as many as would be for his\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Master Frank,\" said Harold, while they were sitting together,\r\n\"what would you have us do for you today?  We are all your humble\r\nservants, and ready to do whatever we can for your pleasure.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Frank, \"the first thing I want you to do, is to carry me\r\nright home to father and mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wish we could, Buddy,\" said Robert; \"but as we cannot do all that\r\ntoday, you must try to think of something else.\"\r\n\r\nFrank could think of nothing.  Robert suggested that he might spend part\r\nof his birthday in learning to shoot.\r\n\r\n\"But I can shoot now,\" he replied.  \"Sister and I have shot many times\r\nalready since we came to the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean,\" said Robert, \"that you should learn to use a gun, so as to\r\nkill whatever you wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, yes,\" said Frank, \"I should like that very much.  For who knows but\r\nsome old bear or panther may come after sister or me yet, before we get\r\naway.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, as for bears,\" Robert maliciously remarked, \"I think you will never\r\nneed a gun.  I think you will always find a tree.\"\r\n\r\nFrank’s face reddened as he returned, \"I don’t care if I did, sir.\r\nCousin Harold knows that I did exactly right.  Didn’t I, cousin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, Frank,\" Robert implored, \"I did not suppose that you felt so\r\nsore about that climbing.  I only said it to teaze you.  I am sure I\r\nshould have done exactly as you did.  But I can’t help laughing to think\r\nhow your feet _twinkled_, as you climbed that tree.\"\r\n\r\nRobert well knew that this half apology would be satisfactory.  Frank\r\nprided himself on his nimbleness, being so lithe and active that his\r\nplaymates used to call him \"squirrel.\"  The allusion to his \"twinkling\"\r\nfeet restored him to good humour.\r\n\r\n\"Now, Frank,\" said Robert, beginning his lecture with the gun in hand,\r\n\"the first lesson I wish to teach you is this, _never let the muzzle of\r\nyour gun point to yourself, or to any person_, and never allow any\r\nperson to point one towards you.  A gun can never kill where it does not\r\npoint.  Even when you are loading, or walking, be careful to hold it so,\r\nthat if it should go off it could hurt nothing.\"\r\n\r\nHe then related several stories, illustrating the fact that almost all\r\naccidents from guns are from careless handling.  Frank was a prudent\r\nchild.  He listened attentively, and then replied,\r\n\r\n\"Brother Robert, I think I had better let the gun alone till I am older.\r\nMay be, if I begin so early, I shall shoot myself or somebody else.\"\r\n\r\nRobert was pleased with this mark of caution in his little brother, and\r\nsaid, \"Hold on to that, Frank, it is a remark worthy of your birthday,\r\nand I trust that every return of this day will find you as wise in\r\nproportion to your age.\"\r\n\r\nThe further instructions intended for Frank that day, being of an\r\nout-door character, were interrupted by a rain that commenced about nine\r\no’clock, and held on steadily all day.  They employed themselves\r\nleisurely in packing and preparing, first for the short voyage\r\ncontemplated on Monday, and also for the longer voyage home.  During the\r\nwhole day the tent was strewed and confused with the various bags,\r\nboxes, trunks, and kegs, intended to receive the articles to be carried.\r\nThey looked and felt like travellers on the eve of departure. About\r\nsunset the rain ceased.  The preparations being now complete, they came\r\ntogether in the tent, and rested on the sofa.  Sam was missing.  He had\r\nnot been seen for half an hour, and now it was getting dark. Presently\r\nthey heard a voice ringing musically through the woods, in the direction\r\nof the boat landing, \"Join, oh, join, oh!  Come, boys, we’re all here!\r\nJoin, oh! join, oh!\"  Frank sprang to his feet, exclaiming, \"That is a\r\ncorn song!\"\r\n\r\nThe music was very simple, and of the kind that may be termed\r\npersuasive.  It was the song usually sung by the negroes of one\r\nplantation, when inviting those of the neighbourhood to join them in\r\ntheir \"corn-shuckings.\"  This practice is much more common in the up\r\ncountry of Georgia, where the corn crop is large, than on the seaboard,\r\nwhere the principal attention is given to cotton.  A corn-shucking\r\nfrolic among these light hearted people, is a scene worth witnessing; it\r\nis always held at night, and concluded about midnight with a feast, and\r\nis to the negro what a quilting party is to country people.\r\n\r\nWhen Frank heard the first stave of Sam’s song, he recalled vividly the\r\nmerry scenes of the corn-shucking, and running towards the landing, met\r\nhim, and returned, holding him by the hand, and joining in the chorus.\r\n\r\nIt was late ere they retired to rest.  They began to realize a tender\r\nnearness to the loved ones at home, such as they had not felt since\r\nparting from them.  They talked long and gratefully over past\r\ndeliverances and future hopes; then closed the evening as those should\r\nwho wish to find the Sabbath a day of blessing.\r\n\r\nThe next morning dawned more dark and uncomfortable than the day\r\npreceding.  The whole sky was loaded with clouds, and the rain fell\r\nevery minute through the day.  The young people probably would have\r\nfound their time pass away very dismally had it not been for the pious\r\nvivacity of Harold, who laid himself out to make it agreeable.  He\r\nfrankly avowed that one reason why he wished to have them unite with him\r\nin spending the Sabbath aright, was his desire to succeed in the effort\r\nto see their friends that week; and he referred for authority, to the\r\nstory told of Sir Matthew Hale, High Chancellor of England, who advised\r\nthat, if there were no higher motive, the Sabbath should be kept sacred\r\nas a matter of _policy_; remarking that, for his own part, he could\r\nalmost foretell his success during the week to come, by the way he spent\r\nthe Sabbath.\r\n\r\nThe others, influenced by a variety of considerations, united with him\r\nin this effort, and the day passed off not only with pleasure, but with\r\nprofit.  Robert had always thought in his heart that this story of Sir\r\nMatthew Hale smacked strongly of superstition; but when he came to\r\nreflect that if the Bible is true, of which he had no doubt, the God who\r\nspeaks to us now is the same who spoke to Moses, and who actually\r\nprospered or hindered the children of Israel according to their\r\nobservance of the Sabbath, he changed his opinion so far as this--he\r\nresolved for the present to adopt the advice of that great man, and then\r\nto watch whether the same results were verified in his own case.  And\r\nalthough his reflections upon this point partook of the merely\r\nphilosophic character that, to some extent, marked the operations of his\r\nmind, the course upon which he resolved had several good effects; it\r\nmade him realize more sensibly his practical relation to God, and caused\r\nhim to watch more closely the consequences resulting from the discharge\r\nor neglect not only of this particular duty, but of duty in the general.\r\nThat resolution, apparently so trifling, and expressed to no one,\r\nstarted him on a perfectly new track, and enabled him to learn, from his\r\nown experience, that \"_whoever will watch the providence of God, will\r\nnever lack a providence to watch_.\"\r\n\r\nOn Monday the weather was worse than before.  They did indeed go out,\r\nwell protected by thick boots, watercoats, and tarpaulin hats, to see\r\nafter their boats; but the day was so chilly, as well as wet, that their\r\nmost comfortable place was near the fire.  Before sunset, however, the\r\nrain ceased, the clouds rapidly dispersed, and when the sun flung his\r\nlast slanting beams across the earth, Robert pointed to Harold a red\r\nspot upon a cloud, which spread so fast, that soon the whole western sky\r\nwas blazing with the promise of a fair morrow. With this expectation\r\nthey made every preparation, and went to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nVOYAGE BOUND THE ISLAND--THE LOST BOAT--STRANGE SIGNALS\r\nAGAIN--HURRICANE--NIGHT MARCH--HELPLESS VESSEL--MELANCHOLY FATE--THE\r\nRESCUE--MAROONERS’ HOSPITALITY--CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\nTuesday morning dawned without a cloud. Before the stars had ceased\r\nshining all hands were called to work, and by the time the sun peeped\r\nover the eastern marsh, they pushed off from their landing, Harold and\r\nSam, with Mum, being in one boat, and Robert, Mary, and Frank, with\r\nFidelle, in the other.  Rowing slowly down the river, against a light\r\nwind from the south-east, the perfume of yellow jessamines (gelseminum\r\nsempervirens), then in rich bloom, so loaded the air, that the young\r\npeople snuffed up the delicious odours, and looked lovingly at the green\r\nisland they were preparing to forsake.\r\n\r\nThe voyage was made almost without incident.  When they had passed out\r\nto sea, the voyagers were rejoiced to find their boats behaving as well\r\nupon the rough water as they had already done upon the smooth--they\r\ndanced joyously upon the gentle swell, as if congratulating their young\r\nbuilders in the happy prospect of a successful voyage.  The boys tried\r\nthe effect of lashing them together, and thus verified the expectation\r\nof their safety; they rubbed and creaked a good deal, and moved less\r\nrapidly than when separate, but they sat upon the water with a\r\nsteadiness which no ordinary commotion could disturb.\r\n\r\nRunning the sea length of the island, and now bending their course for\r\nthe north river, Sam sang out, \"A sail!\"  Far up the coast a faint white\r\nspeck appeared, glancing in the sunbeams, but it soon faded from sight,\r\nand they concluded that either it was a distant sea gull, or else a\r\nvessel passing to the north.  They watched it with interest so long as\r\nit was visible, and then turned into the river.  Had they suspected what\r\nthat white thing was, and that instead of disappearing in the increasing\r\ndistance, it was only obscured by a little mist, as it approached,\r\nbeating against a head wind, they would have forsaken river, island,\r\ntent, everything, and sailed joyfully to meet it.\r\n\r\nThey reached the old encampment at one o’clock, having made the run of\r\ntwenty-six miles in six and a half hours.  The boats behaved so well,\r\nand the winds, sea, and sky were so inviting, that their only regret\r\nwas, that they had not put everything aboard and made a day’s voyage\r\nhomewards.  But doubtless, as Harold remarked, a kind Providence watched\r\nover their path, and would prove its kindness even in this delay.\r\n\r\nHaving taken a hasty survey of their old place of rest and of refuge,\r\nand refreshed themselves at the spring, they resolved to divide their\r\ncompany--Robert’s boat to go direct to the orange landing, where it was\r\nto be left, while the passengers went by land to the tent, and prepared\r\nthe provisions for next day; and Harold and Sam, in the meantime, to\r\ncontinue up the river, and ascertain whether there was not an inland\r\npassage round the island, shorter and easier than the route by sea. With\r\nthis understanding they sailed together to Duck Point, where Robert\r\nturned into the Creek, and putting Mary at the helm, rowed until they\r\ncame to the orange landing, and there moored the boat beside the old\r\nraft. They reached the tent long before sunset, and having completed the\r\nnecessary preparations about dark, began to wish for the return of the\r\nothers.  Several times Robert went to the landing to look for them\r\nbefore the daylight had entirely ceased; and after dark he went again by\r\nthe light of the moon, which, being half full, shed her light at this\r\ntime of the evening perpendicularly upon his path.  He was becoming\r\nuneasy, when afar off he heard the mellow sounds of a boat song; the\r\nnotes grew more and more distinct; the thump of the oars began to be\r\nheard keeping time to the music; finally, the song ceased; a clatter was\r\nheard as the oars were laid in the boat; and soon the whole company were\r\ntogether once more, enjoying the last supper of which they expected to\r\npartake on the island.\r\n\r\n\"What kept you so long?\" inquired Robert.  \"Was the distance great?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" replied Harold, with a look of pleasure; \"we found the distance\r\nonly about six miles, but we were detained by missing our way, and more\r\nespecially by trying to be sure of a piece of very good news.  I think\r\nwe have found the old boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed!\" said Robert, starting to his feet, with the keenness of his\r\ndelight.  \"Where?  How?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the marsh, at the far bend of the river.  I always thought it had\r\nlodged somewhere in that direction, and therefore kept my eyes open at\r\nevery little creek and opening in the marsh.  At last I saw, what I\r\ncannot say positively is _our_ boat, but it is a boat of the same\r\ncolour, and having a stripe of white and black, like ours.  We tried\r\nuntil sunset to approach it, but did not succeed in getting any nearer\r\nthan at first; it is surrounded with soft mud, and a wilderness of\r\nmangroves.\"\r\n\r\nThis was certainly pleasant, though unprofitable, intelligence.  There\r\nwas no prospect of their being able to extricate the boat, except by the\r\nhelp of some uncommon tide; and its value, though considerable, was\r\nnothing in comparison with the necessity for returning home. They\r\nresolved not to wait for it; on the contrary, that they would transport\r\nto the portage, by means of Harold’s boat, the lading intended for\r\nRobert’s; then returning to the prairie, they would take in the second\r\nload, and passing around by the new way, unite at Duck Point, and sail\r\nthence for home.  By rising early they were sure that they could leave\r\nthe island by eleven or twelve o’clock.\r\n\r\nWhile engaged in these plans for the morrow, Sam came in to say that he\r\nwas afraid the next day also would see them on the island, for never in\r\nhis life had he seen clouds gather so rapidly, or fly so fast.  The\r\nlittle company went out, and saw a multitude of low scudding clouds\r\npassing with intense rapidity over the face of the moon.  Suddenly each\r\none started, and looked inquisitively into the others’ faces, for at\r\nthat moment the sound of a cannon, within five miles, came booming from\r\nthe coast.  Robert and Mary turned red and pale by turns.  Frank clapped\r\nhis hands, exclaiming, \"It is father!  O, I know it is father!\"  Harold\r\nfolded his arms--he had evidently acquired something of the composure of\r\nthe Indian.\r\n\r\n\"Quick! quick! let us answer it!\" cried Robert, and with the word darted\r\naway to the tree where the cannon powder was kept.  While he was gone\r\nthere came another report.  They loaded expeditiously, and in a moment\r\nafterwards the dark woods were illuminated with the flash, and the earth\r\nshaken with the thundering discharge.\r\n\r\n\"Now for a march to double quick time!\" said Robert, his strong\r\nexcitement making him the leader of all that was done.  \"But, sister,\r\nwhat shall we do with you and Frank?  You cannot keep pace with us.  You\r\nhad better stay here with Sam, while Harold and I push on to the coast,\r\nand see who is there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Had we not better fire our cannon once more!\" suggested Harold.\r\n\r\n\"Sam can do it,\" Robert answered.  \"Here, Sam, put in so much,\" showing\r\nhim the quantity, \"and fire it until you are sure they hear you.  But\r\nwhat is that?\" he continued, listening to a loud roar that came from the\r\ncoast, and increased like the accumulating rush of waters.\r\n\r\n\"It is a hurricane,\" replied Harold.  \"There is no use in trying to go\r\nnow.  Down with the tent pins! deep! deep! or we shall have our house\r\nblown from above us.\"\r\n\r\nThey hastened all to do what could be done for their immediate\r\nprotection; but there was little to be done. Gaining wisdom from their\r\nformer experience, they had driven down the pins as far as they could go\r\nwhen the tent was pitched, and moreover had raised the floor and\r\ntrenched the premises.  They could only make the upper canvas a little\r\nmore secure, and having done this, they entered the tent a few seconds\r\nbefore the storm burst upon them.  It was a terrible repetition of what\r\nthey had experienced four months before, when Sam was so nearly\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nMary and Frank were in deep distress.  The earnest impetuosity of\r\nRobert, combined with their own thoughts, had left in their minds no\r\ndoubt that the guns fired were from their father; and now, O what a\r\nstorm to meet him on his coming a second time to their truly enchanted\r\nisland!  Frank cried as if his heart would break.  Mary buried her face\r\nin her hands, and prayed to Him who is mighty to deliver, even when the\r\nwinds and the waves overwhelm.\r\n\r\nHarold also was strongly convinced that the guns were from his uncle,\r\nbut he knew that this was only conjectural, and therefore he kindly\r\nremarked in the hearing of the others.\r\n\r\n\"You have no _certain_ reason, Robert, to believe that those guns are\r\nfrom your father.  But suppose that they are, then another thing is\r\ntrue, he is in a vessel, for boats do not usually carry guns.  They were\r\nfired too before the storm came on; therefore they are not signals of\r\ndistress, and also they appear to have come from the river.  Now, if the\r\nperson who fired them is in a vessel, and in the river, what is there to\r\nfear?  He cannot get away tonight, and he cannot probably be hurt by the\r\nstorm.  Let us be quiet until morning, and then go out to see who it\r\nis.\"\r\n\r\nThese thoughts were very comforting.  Mary and Frank ceased their\r\nweeping, and united in the conversation. They all huddled together in\r\nthe middle of the tent.  For hours the wind roared and howled with great\r\nfury, but their tent was protected by the grand wall of forest trees\r\naround, and also by the picket enclosure; and though the wind made the\r\ncanvas flutter, it could neither crush it down nor lift it from above\r\nthem.  Nor did the rain which poured in torrents, and was driven with\r\ngreat violence across the prairie, give them any particular\r\ninconvenience; it was readily shed by the several thicknesses of canvas\r\noverhead, and carried off by the drainage round the tent.\r\n\r\nIn the course of an hour, Mary and Frank fell asleep upon the sofa, and\r\nthe others took such naps as they could obtain, while sitting in their\r\nchairs, and listening to a roar of winds so loud, that if twenty cannons\r\nhad been fired at the river they could scarcely have been heard.\r\n\r\nAbout midnight the rain ceased, and the wind began sensibly to abate.\r\nPuff after puff, and roar after roar, still succeeded each other through\r\nthe forest; but the fury of the storm was over.  An hour before day,\r\nHarold shook Robert by the shoulder, and said, \"I think we can start\r\nnow.  Come and see.\"\r\n\r\nThe sky and woods were pitchy dark, little pools of water covered the\r\nground, and the prairie was rough with huge branches torn from the\r\ntrees, and conveyed to a distance.  These were obstacles and\r\ninconveniences, but not impediments; and as the wind had so far lulled\r\nthat it was possible for a torch to live, Robert decided to make a\r\ntrial.  He waked Mary and Sam, and announcing his intention, said to\r\nthem:\r\n\r\n\"We wish to reach the old encampment by the time there is light enough\r\nto see over the river.  If possible, we will return by eight o’clock,\r\nand let you know all. If we are absent longer than that, you may\r\nconclude that we have found something to do; and in that case, you had\r\nbetter follow us.  We shall, of course, be somewhere on the river; but\r\nas we ourselves do not know where, you had better go direct to Duck\r\nPoint, from which you can see almost all the way to our old spring. Let\r\nme have a piece of white cloth, sister; I will, if necessary, set up a\r\nsignal for you on the beach, to tell you where we are.\"\r\n\r\nMary was exceedingly unwilling to have them depart. The darkness looked\r\nhorrible; their blind path must now be still more obscured by prostrate\r\ntrees and fallen branches; and if they succeeded in reaching the\r\nintended place, they might be called to engage in she knew not what\r\ndangerous enterprise upon water as boisterous as the sea.  Quelling her\r\nanxieties, however, in view of the necessities of the case, she said:\r\n\r\n\"Go, but do take care of yourselves.  Remember that you two are the only\r\nprotectors, except Sam, for Frank and me.\"\r\n\r\nThe boys promised to run no unnecessary risks, and to return if possible\r\nby the appointed hour.  Taking their guns, the spy-glass, and a bundle\r\nof rich splints of lightwood, they set out.  Mary watched their figures\r\ngradually diminishing under the illuminated arches of the forest.  She\r\nnoticed the dark shadows of the trees turning upon their bases as\r\npivots, when the torch passed, until they all pointed towards the tent.\r\nThen the light began to be intercepted; it was seen by fitful glares; it\r\nceased to be seen at all; its course was marked only by a faint\r\nreflection from the tree-tops, or from the misty air; finally every\r\ntrace of the torch and of its reflection was lost to sight, and Mary\r\nreturned, with a sigh and a prayer, to her seat upon the sofa.\r\n\r\nThe boys were compelled to watch very carefully the blazing upon the\r\ntrees, and what few signs of their path remained.  There were no stars\r\nto guide their course, and the marks upon the earth were so perfectly\r\nobliterated by the storm, that several times they missed their way for a\r\nfew steps, and recovered it with the utmost difficulty.  It is scarcely\r\npossible for the best woodsman in the world, of a dark night, and after\r\na storm, to keep a course, or to regain it after it is lost.  The boys\r\nwere extremely fortunate in being able to reach the river by the break\r\nof day.\r\n\r\nNothing yet was visible.  The river and marsh looked like a dark abyss,\r\nfrom which rolled hoarse and angry murmurs.  They gathered some wet\r\nfragments of pine left by them near the oak, and made a fire, beside\r\nwhich they sat and talked.  Was there any person in the river!  Surely\r\nit was time to hear some voice or gun, or to see some answering light.\r\nThey would have hallooed, but there was something oppressive and ominous\r\nin the gloom of that storm-beaten solitude; and, for aught they knew,\r\ntheir call might come only to the wet ears of the drowned and the dead.\r\nThey waited in painful and reverential silence.\r\n\r\nGradually the dark rolling water became visible; then afar off appeared\r\nblack, solitary things, that proved to be the tops of mangroves, higher\r\nthan the rest, around which had gathered moss and dead twigs of the\r\nmarsh. When the light of day more fully developed the scene, they\r\ndescried, at the distance of two miles, an object which the glass\r\nrevealed to be a small vessel, of the pilot boat class, dismantled, and\r\non her beam ends.  This sight filled them with apprehension.\r\n\r\nThere was no person visible on the side or yards; was there any one\r\nliving within?  The companion-way was closed.  Possibly a gun might\r\ncause the persons on board to give some sign of life.\r\n\r\nThe boys made ready to shoot, but neither gun could be discharged.  The\r\npowder was wet.  The only leak in the tent the night before had been\r\ndirectly over the guns, and the rain had dripped into the barrels.  It\r\nwas vain to attempt cleansing them for use; and if they succeeded in\r\nproducing a discharge, how could that help the persons on board?\r\n\r\n\"No, no,\" said Robert, \"what they want is our boat. Let us get that, and\r\ngo immediately to their rescue.\"\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the bluff they planted conspicuously a small pole, in the\r\ncleft top of which Robert slipped a piece of paper, on which was\r\nwritten, \"We have gone for our boat; you will see us as we pass.\r\nRobert.\"\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at the orange landing the boat was floating so far\r\nfrom shore, that without swimming it could scarcely be reached.  The\r\nraft, however, to which it was moored, was nearer the bank, and Harold\r\nmanaged, by climbing a slender sapling near the water’s edge, and\r\nthrowing his weight upon the proper side, to bend it so that he could\r\ndrop upon the raft, and from that to enter the boat.  It was ankle deep\r\nwith water, and there was no gourd nor even a paddle with which to bale\r\nit.  Robert’s ingenuity devised a plan; he threw into the boat an armful\r\nof moss, which soaked up the water like a sponge, and lifting this over\r\nthe gunwale, he squeezed it into the river.\r\n\r\nAfter a short delay they pushed from shore.  To their delight, the tide\r\nwas so high that they could row over the marsh in a straight line for\r\nthe river, which was hardly a mile distant.  On their way the sun burst\r\nthrough a cloud, and appeared so high as to prove that the hour of eight\r\nwas already passed, and that Mary’s company was probably on their way to\r\nthe point before them.  The water in the river was dark and rough, from\r\nthe action of the neighbouring sea, but undisturbed by wind.  On\r\nreaching it they paused, and hallooed to know whether the party by land\r\nhad reached the point; hearing no answer, they resumed their oars, and\r\ncrossed to the other side of the river, where the water was more smooth.\r\n\r\nWe will now leave them for awhile, and return to the company at the\r\ntent.  Mary reclined on the sofa, but could not sleep.  The idea of her\r\nfather in danger, perhaps lost in his effort to rescue them, and\r\nthoughts of the perilous night-march of the boys through a dense forest,\r\nand then the nameless adventures into which her daring cousin and\r\nexcited brother might be tempted, haunted her mind until the grey light\r\nof morning stole through the white canvas, and admonished her to rise.\r\nFrank was fast asleep upon the sofa, covered with a cloak; and Sam’s\r\nsnores sounded long and loud from his shed-room.  On looking at the\r\nwatch, which Harold had left for her convenience, she found that it was\r\nnearly seven o’clock; she did not know that when the sky is densely\r\ncovered by clouds, the dawn does not appear until the sun has nearly\r\nreached the horizon.\r\n\r\nIt was not long after this before a fire was made, and breakfast ready\r\nfor the explorers.  Mary employed herself in every useful way she could\r\ndevise, until the slow minute hand measured the hour of eight; then\r\ntaking a hasty meal, they set out upon their march.  Sam led the van\r\nwith a gun upon his shoulder, and a gourd of water in his hand.  Mary\r\nfollowed, carrying a basket of provision for the hungry boys, and Frank\r\nwent from one to the other, at will, or lagged behind to watch the\r\nmotions of the dogs, that looked thoughtful, as if aware that something\r\nunusual was on hand.\r\n\r\nThe ground was still quite wet, and they were compelled to pick their\r\nway around little pools and puddles that lay in their path; but with\r\ncare they succeeded so well that they would have reached Duck Point in\r\nadvance of the boys, had it not been for a circumstance that interested\r\nthem much, while it filled them with gloom.\r\n\r\nNearing the point, the dogs, that had hitherto followed very demurely\r\nbehind, pricked up their ears, and trotted briskly towards the water’s\r\nside.  Sam noticed this, and remarked, \"Dey after tukkey I ’speck, but\r\nwe a’n’t got no time fo’ tukkey now.\"  Soon after, their attention was\r\narrested by hearing a cry from the dogs, which was neither a bark nor a\r\nwhine, but a note of distress made up of both.\r\n\r\n\"Eh! eh!\" said Sam.  \"Wat dem dog after now? Dah no cry for deer, nor\r\nfor tukkey, nor for squirrel. Missus, you and Mas Frank stay here one\r\nminute, till I go see w’at dem dog about.  I sho’ dey got some’n\r\nstrange.  Only harkee how dey talk!\"\r\n\r\nSam was in fact fearful that some sad accident had befallen Robert and\r\nHarold, and that the dogs, having scented them by the light wind coming\r\ndown the river, had given utterance to this moan of distress.  He\r\ntherefore walked with hurried steps in the direction from which the\r\nsound proceeded, while Mary and Frank, unwilling to be left alone,\r\nfollowed slowly behind him. He had not gained more than twenty paces the\r\nadvance, when they saw him stop--run a few steps forward--then stop\r\nagain, and lift up his hands with an exclamation of surprise.  They\r\nhurried to his side, and found him gazing, with looks of horror, into a\r\nlittle strip of bushes that skirted the margin of the tide water.\r\n\r\n\"What is the matter, Sam?\" inquired Mary.\r\n\r\n\"Look, Missus,\" he replied, pointing with his finger. \"Enty[#] dat some\r\npeople drown dey in de ma’sh?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n[#] Is not that.\r\n\r\n\r\nMary and Frank looked, and saw what appeared to be in truth, the bodies\r\nof two persons fast locked in each other’s arms, and lodged upon the top\r\nof a submerged mallow, which allowed them to sway back and forth with\r\nthe undulations of the water.  Sam was hesitating what to do--for\r\nnegroes are almost universally superstitious about dead people.  Mary\r\nurged him on.\r\n\r\n\"You will not leave them there, will you?\" she inquired; \"you will\r\nsurely draw them out, and see who they are.  May be, too, they are not\r\ndead.  O, get them out, Sam, get them at once.\"\r\n\r\nShamed out of his superstitious fear, Sam reluctantly obeyed the\r\ninjunction of his mistress.  He waded carefully and timidly along, until\r\nhe could lay hold of the bodies, and drag them to shore.\r\n\r\n\"W’ite man and nigger, Missus,\" he said, solemnly, as the movement\r\nthrough the water revealed the pale features of the one, and the woolly\r\nhead of the other. \"De w’ite man, I dun-know[#] who he is, he look like\r\nsailor; and de nigger--\"  He had now drawn them ashore, and examined\r\ntheir features.  It would have made any one’s heart sad to hear the\r\ngroan that came from the poor fellow, when he had looked steadily into\r\nthe face of the dead man.  He staggered, fell on his knees in the water,\r\nembraced the wet body, and kissed it.\r\n\r\n\r\n[#] Dun-know, don’t know.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"O my Missus,\" he cried, \"it is Peter! my own brudder Peter!  De only\r\nbrudder I got in dis wide wull.  O Peter--Peter!\" and he wept like a\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n\"Draw them out, Sam,\" said Mary, energetically; \"draw them on high\r\nground, and let us rub them as we rubbed you.  There may be life in them\r\nyet.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Missus,\" he replied, pulling the bodies higher ashore.  \"No life\r\nhere.  He cold--he stiff--he dead.  O Peter, my brudder, I glad to meet\r\nyou once mo’. Huddee[#] Peter!  Huddee boy!\"  The poor fellow actually\r\nshook hands with the corpse, and poured out afresh his unaffected\r\nsorrows.\r\n\r\n\r\n[#] Howdye.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs soon as the bodies were drawn sufficiently from the water, Mary\r\nproceeded to examine them.  The face of the white man was unknown to\r\nher, he appeared to have been a respectable sailor.  He and Peter were\r\nevidently stiff dead.  She was so certain they were beyond all hope of\r\nrecovery, that she did not even require their clothes to be unloosed, or\r\nany means to be used for their restoration.  She waited on the mourning\r\nbrother until the first burst of his grief was over, then she and Frank\r\naided him to make a sort of brush wood fence around the bodies, to\r\nprotect them until something could be done for their interment.\r\n\r\nIt was while they were engaged in this last duty that Robert and Harold\r\npassed the point.  Their halloo might, under ordinary circumstances,\r\nhave been heard; but with their own occupation of mind, the rustle of\r\nbushes dragged along, and the roar of the distant surf, the voices of\r\nthe boatmen sounded in vain.\r\n\r\nFrom the point the boys proceeded, it was said, to the other side of the\r\nriver, to escape the waves that dashed heavily against the island.  The\r\nwhole marsh, from bluff to bluff, was one flood of water, with the\r\nexception of patches of the more luxuriant herbage that peered above the\r\nrolling surface.  The mangroves, though generally immersed, broke so\r\ncompletely the violence of the waves, that the water above and around\r\nthem, was comparatively smooth, while in the channel of the river it was\r\ntoo rough for safety.\r\n\r\nPicking their way over the tops of the low bushes, and around the\r\nbranching summits of the taller, the boys rowed steadily towards the\r\nunfortunate vessel.  They had gone not quite half a mile from shore,\r\nwhen they heard a gun, and looking back, they saw Mary’s company\r\nbeckoning to them.  It was too late to return, without great sacrifice\r\nof time; and Robert pointed with one hand to the distant vessel, and\r\nwith the other to the place of the old encampment.  These signs were\r\nunderstood; the company on shore, after looking steadily at the distant\r\nobject on the water, disappeared in the woods, and afterwards\r\nre-appeared above the old spring.\r\n\r\nThe labour of rowing increased as the boat proceeded. The passage\r\nthrough the marsh became more intricate, and the swell from sea began to\r\nbe more sensibly felt through the irregular openings.  But with the\r\nincrease of difficulties came also an increase of energy, as they\r\napproached the vessel.  They were now about a quarter of a mile distant.\r\nTheir hands were sore, and their limbs weary with rowing.  They tried\r\nnot to exert themselves any more vigorously than before, lest they\r\nshould utterly exhaust their strength, but they nevertheless observed,\r\nthat as they neared the vessel, their boat did somehow move more rapidly\r\nthrough the water, and crowd with greater skill through the narrow\r\nopening.\r\n\r\nAs the young boatmen came within hail they would have called, had they\r\nnot been restrained by the same ominous feeling which they experienced\r\non the beach. With beating hearts they rowed silently around the bow of\r\nthe vessel.  The waves dashed heavily against it, and came up the\r\ninclined deck, oftentimes higher than the companion-way.  They moored\r\nthe boat to the broken mast, and then clambering along the pile of\r\nsea-weed and mangroves, which the vessel had collected in drifting, came\r\nat last to the cabin door.  Robert could not say one word; his heart had\r\nrisen into his mouth, and he felt almost ready to faint.\r\n\r\n\"Hallo!\" cried Harold, his own voice husky with emotion.  \"Is anybody\r\nwithin?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" responded a voice near the cabin door. It was a female\r\nvoice, and its familiar tones thrilled to Harold’s very soul.  \"Yes,\r\nyes, there are three of us here.  Who is that calling?\"\r\n\r\n\"Harold,\" he answered, \"Harold Mc----.\"  The name was not finished.  He\r\nreeled as he spoke, and leaned pale as a sheet against the\r\ncompanion-way.  That voice was not to be mistaken, little as he expected\r\nto hear it on that dark river.  It was the voice first known to him, and\r\nfirst loved of all earthly voices.  He tried again to answer; it was in\r\nvain.  He groaned in very anguish of joy, and the big tears rolled down\r\nhis face.  Robert answered for him.\r\n\r\n\"Harold McIntosh and Robert Gordon.  Who is in here?\"\r\n\r\nThe voice from within did not reply.  It seemed as if the person to whom\r\nit belonged was also overcome by emotion; for soon after they heard her\r\nspeak tremulously,\r\n\r\n\"Brother!  Sister!  Thank God--our boys--are here!\"\r\n\r\nRobert did not recognize the voice of his aunt, nor did he understand\r\nthe speechless look which his cousin turned upon him, until after two or\r\nthree violent sobs, Harold replied to his inquiring look, \"My mother!\r\nRobert, mother!\"\r\n\r\nHearing the exclamation from within, Robert had now recovered from his\r\nown torture of suspense, and leaned down to the cabin-door in time to\r\nhear the manly voice of Dr. Gordon, asking in tones that showed he too\r\nwas struggling to command himself,\r\n\r\n\"My children, are you all well?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, father, all well,\" Robert replied.  He wished to ask also, \"Is\r\nmother here?\" but his voice again failed; he fell upon the leaning door,\r\nand gave vent to a passionate flood of tears.  While leaning there he\r\nheard his aunt call out, \"Come, help me, brother.  She has fainted.\"\r\nBut that answer was enough; his mother was there.\r\n\r\nThe boys tried in vain to open the door; it was secured on the inside,\r\nand it was not until after some delay that Dr. Gordon removed not only\r\nthe bolt, but various appliances that he had used to keep the water from\r\ndripping into his sister’s berth, and gave each a hearty shake of the\r\nhand as they leaned sideways to enter the door, and clambered in the\r\ndark cabin.  Dark, however, as that cabin was, and insecure as was the\r\nfooting of the boys, it was not long before each was locked in his\r\nmother’s arms.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gordon was very feeble, and her face much emaciated with suffering.\r\nShe said little more at first than to ask after Mary and Frank.  This\r\nsilence alarmed Robert; he knew that joy is usually loquacious, and he\r\nheard his aunt talking very earnestly with Harold; but he forgot that\r\nhis mother was just recovering from a swoon, and that extreme joy\r\nexpresses itself differently in different persons.  His father, seeing\r\nhim look anxiously into her pale, thin face, remarked, \"She will recover\r\nfast enough, now.  The only medicine she needed was to meet you all.\"\r\n\r\n\"O, yes,\" she too observed.  \"Give me now my dear Mary and Frank, and I\r\nthink I shall soon get well.\"\r\n\r\n\"We can give them to you in an hour, if you are able to bear removal,\"\r\nsaid Robert.  \"Is she able, father?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes, able enough,\" his father answered.  \"And, I presume, we had\r\nbetter go, before the tide recedes, or we may be caught in the marsh.\r\nCome, let us load without delay.\"\r\n\r\nThey removed the trunks, and other things needful, to the boat; the boys\r\nrelating all the while to their delighted parents what a beautiful\r\nprairie home they had, and how well it was stocked with every comfort.\r\n\"Everything,\" said Robert, \"except father and mother; and now we are\r\ntaking them there.\"\r\n\r\nThe boat was brought close to the vessel’s side, and held there firmly\r\nby Dr. Gordon, while the ladies were assisted by the boys.  And with\r\nwhat pride those mothers leaned upon those brave and manly sons--grown\r\nfar more manly since their exile--may be imagined, but can not be\r\ndescribed.  Mrs. Gordon recovered her vivacity, and a great portion of\r\nher strength, before she left the cabin. Joy had inspired her heart, and\r\nenergized her muscles. Mrs. McIntosh also seemed to grow happier every\r\nmoment, as she discovered the mental and moral developments of her son.\r\nDr. Gordon, having carefully closed the companion-way, took the helm,\r\nand the boys the oars, while the mothers, with their faces towards the\r\nbow, looked with eyes of love and admiration upon the young labourers,\r\nwho were requiting life for life, and love for love, what had been\r\nbestowed on them in their infancy.\r\n\r\nAs they were passing through the marsh, Mrs. Gordon spied several human\r\nfigures on a distant bluff.  They were exceedingly small, but distinctly\r\nmarked against the sky.\r\n\r\n\"Can they be my dear little Mary and Frank?\" she asked.\r\n\r\nThe boys replied that they were, and she waved her white handkerchief to\r\nthem, in the hope of attracting their attention.\r\n\r\nThe water was still so rough in the channel, that, anxious as the\r\nparents were to embrace their long-lost children, Dr. Gordon decided\r\nthat instead of attempting the passage directly across, in their heavily\r\nloaded skiff, they must continue up the river, through the irregular\r\nopenings of the marsh.\r\n\r\nThey came at last near enough to be discovered by Mary and Frank, who,\r\nseeing the boat load of passengers going up the river, needed no\r\ninvitation to meet them at Duck Point.  The two companies reached the\r\nbeach about the same time.  Frank rushed right through the water, and\r\nsprang into his mother’s lap; Mary was lifted into the boat by Robert,\r\nwho waded back and forth to bring her; and Sam, though he was saddened\r\nby the melancholy fate of his brother, came with open lips and shining\r\nteeth, to shake hands with Mossa and Missus, as soon as the children\r\ngave him an opportunity.\r\n\r\nHere they stopped long enough to allow the hungry boys to refresh\r\nthemselves from Mary’s basket of provisions, and Sam’s gourd of water.\r\nThey were almost ravenous.  Dr. Gordon then went with Robert overland,\r\nto bring the other boat from the prairie to the portage, while Harold\r\nand Sam conducted the company by water to the orange landing.  From this\r\nlatter place Mrs. McIntosh preferred to walk alone with her son to the\r\ntent, leaving the others to descend the river.\r\n\r\nDuring this part of the voyage, Dr. Gordon first learnt with certainty\r\nthe fate of Peter and the sailor.  As soon therefore as Mrs. Gordon had\r\nlanded, he left Robert to support her to the tent, and re-entering the\r\nboat with Sam, went to rescue the bodies from their exposure, and to\r\nprepare them for a decent burial.  It was late in the afternoon when\r\nthey returned; and, as the best they could do with the dead bodies, they\r\nleft them all night in the boat, covered with a sail, and pushed a\r\nlittle distance from the land.\r\n\r\nThe young housekeepers laid themselves out to entertain their welcome\r\nguests.  Mary provided them with an early and delightful supper, which\r\nwas highly seasoned with love and good will.  Mrs. Gordon and Mrs.\r\nMcIntosh reclined on Mary’s sofa, the others gathered round to complete\r\nthe circle, and the young people gave snatches of their eventful\r\nhistory.  It was late before any one thought of retiring.  Then Dr.\r\nGordon called for a copy of the Scriptures.  He talked of their\r\nseparation, their sorrows, dangers, escapes, and now of their joyful\r\nreunion.  After that, he read the ninety-first Psalm, which speaks of\r\nthe protection that God promises to His people, and kneeling down, he\r\noffered their united thanksgiving for all the past, and their united\r\nprayer that the Lord would be their God, and make them His loving,\r\ngrateful people.  When they arose from their knees, every eye was wet\r\nwith the tears of gratitude and joy.\r\n\r\nThe sleeping arrangements for the night were hasty and scant.  Mary lay\r\nbetween her mother and aunt, for whom two of the narrow mattresses of\r\nthe vessel had been placed side by side, and covered with the bear-skin.\r\nFrank nestled into the bosom of his father, and close beside him on\r\nanother mattress lay Robert.  Harold had chosen the sofa.  After the\r\nlabours and disturbances of the past twenty-four hours, sleep came\r\nwithout invitation.  The moon and stars shone brilliantly overhead, the\r\nair was uncommonly pure, as if washed clean by the preceding rain, and\r\nthe leafy forest, which had so often enclosed in its bosom the young but\r\nhopeful exiles, now murmured all night its soft blessings upon a\r\nreunited family.\r\n\r\n                     *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\nHaving extended this history far beyond the limits originally intended,\r\nit is time to close with a few hurried words.\r\n\r\nPoor Peter was buried the next night by torchlight, according to the\r\nromantic custom prevalent among the negroes.  Locked indissolubly in\r\neach other’s arms, he and the sailor were laid in the same grave, and a\r\ndouble head and foot-board was sunk to mark the spot.\r\n\r\nAfter much labour, and many dangers and delays (to recount which would\r\nrequire almost another volume), they raised and launched their little\r\nvessel, recovered the sail boat, provided suitably for their brute pets,\r\nsailed from the Island of Refuge and arrived safely at Bellevue, where\r\nthey had been long expected, and almost given up for lost.\r\n\r\nBefore they left, the health of Mrs. Gordon was rapidly and almost\r\nperfectly restored.  Fed from her children’s stores, drinking from their\r\ntupelo spring, and regaled in every sense by the varied productions of\r\nthat land of enchantment, but more especially charmed by her children’s\r\nlove there was nothing more for her to desire, except the presence of\r\nthe dear ones left behind.\r\n\r\nThe joy of beginning their return to Bellevue was, however, strangely\r\ndashed with sorrow, at parting from scenes tenderly endeared by a\r\nthousand associations.  As they passed down the river, a gentle gale\r\ncame from the woods, loaded with the perfume of flowers.  Harold pointed\r\nto his mother the tall magnolia on the river bank, which had been to him\r\na Bethel (Gen. xviii. 16-19); it was now in bloom, and two magnificent\r\nflowers, almost a foot in diameter, set like a pair of brilliant eyes\r\nnear the top, looked kindly upon him, and seemed to watch him until he\r\nhad passed out of sight.  The live oak, under whose immense shade their\r\ntent had been first pitched, was the last tree they passed; a nonpareil,\r\nhidden in the branches, sat whistling plaintively to its mate; a mocking\r\nbird was on the topmost bough, singing with all its might a song of\r\nendless variety; and underneath a herd of shy, peeping deer had\r\ncollected, and looked inquisitively at the objects moving upon the\r\nwater.  It seemed to the young people as if the whole island had centred\r\nitself upon that bluff, to reproach them with ingratitude, and protest\r\nagainst their departure.  But their resolution could not now be changed;\r\nthe prow of their vessel held on its way.  _The Marooning Party was\r\nOver_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END",
