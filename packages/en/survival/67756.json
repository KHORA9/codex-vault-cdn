Taylor.\r\n\r\n          Delivered at the Confederate Reunion at Brownsville,\r\n                         Tenn., in August, 1902.\r\n\r\n\r\nTime in its tireless flight has brought us again to the full leaf and\r\nflower of another summer. The grass grows green about the dust of heroes;\r\nthe roses twine once more about their tomb, and the morning-glories\r\npoint their purple bugles toward the sky as if to sound a reveille to\r\nour immortal dead. Another year with its sunshine and its shadows, its\r\nlaughter and its tears, its sowing and its reaping, its cradle songs and\r\nfuneral hymns, now lies between us and that dark day at Appomattox when\r\nthe star of Southern hope went down and the flag of Southern chivalry was\r\nfurled forever. Another year has added whiter locks to the temples of\r\nthose old veterans who wore the gray, and deeper furrows to their brows,\r\nand they now stand among us like solitary oaks in the middle of a fallen\r\nforest, hoary with age, covered with scars, and glorious as the living\r\nmonuments of Southern manhood and Southern courage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SAM DAVIS.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut we are not yet far enough away from that awful struggle to forget\r\nthe bloody hills of Shiloh, where Albert Sidney Johnston died, and the\r\nfatal field of Chancellorsville, where Stonewall Jackson fell. We are\r\nnot yet far enough away to forget the frowning heights of Gettysburg,\r\nwhere Pickett’s charging lines rushed to glory and the grave. We are\r\nnot yet far enough away to forget Murfreesboro, Missionary Ridge and\r\nChickamauga, and the hundred other fields of death and courage, where\r\nthe flower of the South, the bravest of the brave and the truest of the\r\ntrue, fought for the cause they thought was right, and died for the land\r\nthey loved. We are not yet far enough away to forget the agony and the\r\ntears of a nation that was crushed when the shattered armies of Lee and\r\nJohnston, weary, half-starved, bare-footed and in rags, stacked their\r\narms in the gloom of defeat, and left the field of valor overwhelmed\r\nand overpowered, yet undaunted and unconquered. When time has measured\r\noff a thousand years, the world will not forget the sufferings and\r\nthe sacrifices of the brave men who so freely gave their fortunes and\r\nshed their blood to preserve the most brilliant civilization that ever\r\nflourished in any land or in any age, for literature loves a lost cause.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  ALBERT SIDNEY JOHNSTON.\r\n]\r\n\r\nHistorians will some day sit down on our battlefield and write true\r\nhistory—history that will surpass the wildest dreams of fancy that were\r\never woven into fiction; and poets will linger among our graves and sing\r\nsweeter songs than were ever sung before. For each monument is within\r\nitself a volume of wild and thrilling adventure, and every tombstone\r\ntells a story touching as the soldier’s last tear on the white bosom of\r\nhis manhood’s bride, tender as his last farewell.\r\n\r\nI would not utter a word of bitterness against the men who wore the blue.\r\nThey fought and died under the old flag to perpetuate the Union, and they\r\nwere men worthy of Southern prowess and Southern valor. I would not, if I\r\ncould, rob Grant, the great and noble chieftain, of his fame and glory.\r\nEvery Southern soldier ought to stand with uncovered head when his name\r\nis spoken. For when all was lost, in the darkest and saddest moment of\r\nSouthern history, he was magnanimous to Lee, and kind to his famished\r\nand shattered army. Along the blue lines of the triumphant foe, when the\r\nunhappy Confederates marched between them and laid down their guns, there\r\nwas no shout of victory nor flourish of trumpets, but only silence and\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nWhen the conflict had ended the Confederate soldier proudly stood among\r\nthe blackened walls of his ruined country, magnificent in the gloom of\r\ndefeat, and still a hero. His sword was broken, his home was in ashes,\r\nthe earth was red beneath him, the sky was black above him; he had placed\r\nall in the scales of war and had lost all save honor. But he did not sit\r\ndown in despair to weep away the passing years.\r\n\r\nHis slaves were gone but he was still a master. Too proud to pine, too\r\nstrong to yield to adversity, he threw down his musket and laid his\r\nwilling but unskilled hands upon the waiting plow. He put away the\r\nknapsack of war and turned his face toward the morning of peace. He\r\nabandoned the rebel yell to enter the forum and the court room and the\r\nhustings. He gave up the sword to enter the battles of industry and\r\ncommerce, and now, in little more than a third of a century, the land of\r\ndesolation and death, the land of monuments and memories, has reached the\r\nspringtime of a grander destiny, and the sun shines bright on the domes\r\nand towers of new cities built upon the ashes of the old, and the cotton\r\nfields wave their white banners of peace and the fields of wheat wave\r\nback their banners of gold.\r\n\r\nWho can portray the possibilities of a country that has produced the Lees\r\nand Jacksons and the brilliant Gordon and the dashing Joe Wheeler, who is\r\nas gallant in the blue as he was glorious in the gray, and the impetuous\r\nand immortal Bedford Forrest, the Marshal Ney of the Confederacy? Who\r\ncan portray the possibilities of a country which has produced the\r\nstalwart and sinewy men of the rank and file, who followed the stars and\r\nbars through the smoke and flame of every desperate battle and stepped\r\nproudly into history as the greatest fighters the world has ever known?—a\r\ncountry so richly blessed not only with brave men and beautiful women,\r\nbut whose blossoming hills and fertile valleys are so generous and kind,\r\nand whose mountains are burdened with coal and iron and copper and zinc\r\nand lead enough to supply the world for a thousand years; whose virgin\r\nforests yet stand awaiting and sighing for the woodsman’s ax, and whose\r\nwinding rivers flow clear and cool and make music as they go. It is the\r\nbeautiful land of love and liberty, of sunshine and sentiment, of fruits\r\nand flowers, where the grape-vine staggers from tree to tree as if drunk\r\nwith the wine of its own purple clusters; where peach and plum and\r\nblood-red cherries and every kind of berry bend bough and bush and glow\r\nlike showered drops of rubies and pearls. It is the land of the magnolia\r\nand the melon, the paradise of the cotton and the cane.\r\n\r\nThey tell us now that it is the new South, but the same old blood runs\r\nin the veins of these old veterans and the same old spirit heaves their\r\nbosoms and flashes in their eyes; the same old soldiers who wielded\r\nthe musket long ago are nursing their grandchildren on their knees and\r\nteaching them the same old lessons of honor and truth, and the same old\r\nlove of liberty. The mocking-bird sings the same old songs in the same\r\nold tree, and the brooks laugh and leap down the same old hollows. It is\r\nthe same old South and we are the same old Southern people:\r\n\r\n  There may be skies as blue, but none bluer;\r\n  There may be hearts as true, but none truer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  STONEWALL JACKSON.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is the same old land of the free and the same old home of the brave.\r\nIt is the same old South resurrected from the dead, with the prints of\r\nthe nails still in its hands and the scars of the spear still in its side.\r\n\r\n  “I’m glad I am in Dixie,\r\n    Look away! Look away!\r\n  And live and die for Dixie,\r\n    Look away! Look away!\r\n  Look away down South in Dixie.”\r\n\r\nWithin the borders of this fair land of Dixie the finest opportunities\r\nfor investment and the richest fields for enterprise ever known in the\r\nWestern Hemisphere are now open to all who wish to come and help us to\r\nmake it blossom like the rose. A new development has already begun.\r\nThirty years ago there was not a factory in South Carolina. To-day she\r\nis spinning and weaving more cotton than she raises and is second only\r\nto Massachusetts in the manufacture of cotton goods; and North Carolina\r\nand Georgia have made equal progress with South Carolina in this new\r\nidea of making the South not only the leader in agriculture, but also\r\nin converting our raw material into finished articles of commerce and\r\ntrade, and thus saving to our section countless millions of wealth. In\r\nthe mountains of south-western Virginia, south-eastern Kentucky, East\r\nTennessee, North Alabama, where the sunshine plays hide and seek with\r\nthe shadows, and where many rivers are born, there is a beautiful valley\r\nsix hundred miles in length and from one to thirty miles wide. Until\r\na quarter of a century ago the principal product of that country was\r\nchildren. The people did not realize that the north rim of the valley was\r\nalmost an unbroken vein of coal and that the South was an exhaustless bed\r\nof iron, and they placed but little value on the vast parks of timber\r\nwhere the ax had never gleamed, but now the dynamite has just begun to\r\njar the silent hills and the forests have just begun to fall. Birmingham\r\nis making the sky of night red with the glare of her furnaces, and all\r\nthe way up the valley to the new city of Roanoke new furnaces are being\r\nlighted and new industries are developing, and Huntsville, Decatur,\r\nChattanooga, Knoxville, Johnson City and Bristol on the line, will soon\r\nbe great manufacturing centers, where the pig iron and the logs of\r\nhardwood that are now being shipped away to be converted into finished\r\narticles will pass through our own mills and we will cease to be the\r\nfools we have been in the past, buying furniture made in foreign cities\r\nout of our own timber and all the implements of agriculture made out of\r\nour own iron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GENERAL GORDON.\r\n]\r\n\r\nUntil twenty years ago the sons of Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas\r\nwere contented to sit on their verandas and watch the “nigger” and his\r\nlazy mule in the cotton field and listen to the melodies of the old\r\nplantation. But now the mills of Mississippi are beginning to mingle\r\ntheir music with these melodies, and the marshes of Louisiana are being\r\nconverted into rice fields and she is making enough sugar to-day to\r\nsweeten the tooth of the world. Arkansas is building factories and\r\nopening her mines and mineral wealth, and sawing down her great forests\r\nof pine. At the close of the Civil War Texas was a wilderness, but now\r\nthe howl of the wolf has given place to the whistle of the engine, and\r\nthe whoop of the Indian has been hushed by the music of machinery. From\r\nTexarkana to El Paso prosperous cities and towns have sprung up like\r\nprairie flowers where the wild horse once galloped and the buffalo\r\ngrazed, and great geysers of coal oil have solved the fuel problem.\r\n\r\nIn the full development of this new idea of transforming our raw material\r\ninto finished goods lies our hope of regaining our prestige and power\r\nin the management of national affairs, and of winning back billions of\r\nwealth which were wiped out by the destroying angel of war. God grant\r\nthat our beloved old South may be as happy in reaping the golden harvest\r\nof prosperity in the years to come as she has been brave and true through\r\nthe suffering and woes of adversity in the sorrowful years of the past.\r\n\r\nAnd now, my grizzled old friends who once wore the gray, in the name of\r\nthe young men I congratulate you upon having lived to see the dawn of\r\na brighter day for your battle-scarred and war-swept country. You must\r\nsoon answer to the roll call of eternity and join your comrades on the\r\nother side. I give you the pledge of your sons that they will ever defend\r\nthe record you have made and themselves live up to the traditions of\r\ntheir fathers. In the name of our women, both young and old, I implore\r\nthe blessing of the Lord upon you, and pray that as the dews of life’s\r\nevening are condensing on your brow and the shadows of the long, long\r\nnight are gathering about you, you may linger long in the twilight, with\r\nloving hands to lead you and loving hearts to bless.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HARRISON’S GIFT AT CAMP CHASE.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              IN THE DARK.\r\n\r\n                             [Illustration]\r\n\r\n                         By Grace MacGowan Cooke\r\n\r\n\r\nVirginia sat late at her work. Or rather, she sat before the desk\r\nwhich contained her work and fought the battle which is as old as our\r\nconception of a woman’s duty. She had that day listened to words of love\r\nfrom a man whom her heart rose up to answer—she, betrothed to Parke\r\nWinchester. Hasn’t a woman a right to change her mind? Ah, but Parke—his\r\nsalvation as well as his happiness was in her hands! Had he not told her\r\nso a hundred times? Was he not drinking hard, and going straight to the\r\ndogs when she was coaxed into this secret pact with him? If she let him\r\ngo, if she pushed him away from her, would he not fall lower? Could she\r\never forgive herself?\r\n\r\nThen, she was uneasy about Fair; her young brother was evidently finding\r\ncompanions who did him no good. Twice he had come home of late so much\r\nunder the influence of drink that she was put to the utmost of her powers\r\nto keep the matter from her father. She had no mother, she and Fair were\r\nthe only children. In her desperation she had gone to Winchester; he\r\nwould know, he would understand. She remembered the feverish eagerness\r\nwith which he had answered her.\r\n\r\n“You know, of course, Virginia, that I haven’t touched a drop since you\r\npromised to marry me. I can’t bear the thought of the stuff now. But I’ll\r\nhang around some of the places where it’s sold and catch up with Fair. I\r\ncan help him. I can save him for you, Virginia, honey, because I’ve been\r\nthere myself.”\r\n\r\nNow, if she broke her word to Winchester she was losing more than her\r\nlover, for he had added fiercely, “But if you cast me off, if you\r\nbreak with me, I’ll go straight to the devil. You’ve got that on your\r\nconscience, little woman. I’ll go, and I’ll take Fair with me if I can.\r\nYou’ve got the souls of two men in your keeping, for if you were my\r\nwife—as long as you have promised to be my wife—I’d as soon think of\r\nstealing a Bible from a church as taking a drink of whisky.”\r\n\r\nThen came the thought of the other man, whom she could really love—the\r\nman who would save his own soul and not ask the sacrifice of a woman’s\r\nhappiness for his salvation. Yet, she reasoned, it was a marvelous thing\r\nthat her influence should have kept her betrothed from even the desire\r\nfor drink. She half wished for a moment that influence were not so great.\r\nThen she reproved herself, sighed and pushed the heavy, dark hair from\r\noff her forehead. A vagrant, scuffling sound from the hallway outside\r\nkept intruding upon her consciousness. Finally the little intermittent\r\nnoise secured her attention, and then she thought a dog or a cat must\r\nhave been left inside when the house was closed for the night. She\r\nstepped to the door, to be met by a shambling, bowing old figure, and\r\nUncle Vete’s deprecating, apologetic face.\r\n\r\n“I hates ter ’sturb you, li’l Mis,” he protested. “I hates might’ly ter\r\n’sturb you; but dey’s trouble out to my house—I spect you knows ’bout it,\r\nhoney.”\r\n\r\nVirginia drew back, took up her lamp and motioned the old man to follow\r\nher downstairs to the dining room. “Don’t wake father, if it’s about\r\nFairfax,” she cautioned. “It would only hurt his feelings, and make a bad\r\nmatter worse.”\r\n\r\n“Yas, baby chile, dat des’ what Vete was fearin’.” They stole softly\r\nto the dining room, and stood there confronted in the lamplight, the\r\ntall girl in her white dress, and the wizened little old negro in his\r\ncomically ill-fitting broadcloth, hat in hand.\r\n\r\n“You see ’t ’uz dishyer way: Marse Fair, he come out ter my place dis\r\nmawnin’—you know, Mis’, he train wid a feller what allers come out dar\r\nwhen he git ter spreein’. I uzzen’ dar. ’Ouldn’t ’a’ been no trouble ef\r\nI’d a’ been dar. Unk’ Vete can manage de bofe of ’em, tell dey git too\r\nbad.”\r\n\r\n“Who was with my brother?” inquired the girl sharply.\r\n\r\nThe little old black man stole a side-long look at his interlocutrice. He\r\nwas a slave, born on the Sevier plantation, body servant to her father,\r\nGeneral Sevier, in whose discarded wear he now stood; and loyalty to the\r\nname warred in him with that freemasonry which keeps the male silent\r\nabout the shortcomings of another male, when speaking to the woman who\r\nmost needs to be warned of them.\r\n\r\n“Dey dest one feller lef’ wid Marse Fair,” he mumbled. “Dey wuz a whole\r\npassel o’ boys dis mawnin’. But dem yutheh boys tuk an’ went home, whiles\r\ndey could walk. An’ I cain’t git Marse Fair to move.”\r\n\r\n“Well, Uncle Vete, I’ll put on my things and go with you,” said Virginia,\r\nwith sudden resolution. “I can manage Fair.” Returning, hat in hand, she\r\nhad the curiosity to inquire, “How did you get in, Uncle Vete?”\r\n\r\n“W’y, yo’ cook lady hyer, she a sisteh in de ‘Ban’ o’ High and Glor’ous\r\nWardens,’ an’ I b’longs to de same division; an’ she lef’ me in, honey;\r\nshe lef’ me in.”\r\n\r\n“Did you drive?”\r\n\r\n“I come ’long er’ ol’ Belzybug an’ de cyart.”\r\n\r\n“And Beelzebub has made two trips to-day,” added Virginia. “He must be\r\ntired. Put him in the barn, Uncle Vete, and we’ll get a street hack as we\r\ngo down past Summer Avenue.”\r\n\r\n“An’ have ol’ Marse askin’ quisti’ns ’bout dat mule in de mawnin’? No,\r\nma’am. No, li’l lady. I got a frien’, down de road hyer a piece, what\r\nkeep a wagon yawd. I gwine leave dat mule dah, Miss Ginnie.”\r\n\r\nThe streets were quite deserted; it was near twelve o’clock. Virginia was\r\nglad that she met no one, though the little old black man bobbing after\r\nher was as efficient an escort and protector as she could have had. The\r\nstreet hack of the small Southern city is most commonly a vehicle of the\r\nfamily carriage style; probably many of them have descended from the\r\nestate of domestic privacy. One found, its sleeping driver wakened, his\r\ngaunt horse prodded into action, Virginia leaned forward, and began to\r\nask Uncle Vete further questions in a carefully lowered tone, as he sat\r\nbeside the driver.\r\n\r\n“Is he worse than before?”\r\n\r\n“’Bout de same, honey, des ’bout de same. I is saw ’um mo’ ’rageous; an’\r\nergin, I is saw ’um less ’rageous. ’Bout so an’ so, honey. Des ’bout so\r\nan’ so, Miss Ginnie, chile.”\r\n\r\n“You say there’s some one with him; are they inside the house?”\r\n\r\nUncle Vete grinned, and twisted in his seat. “Yas, honey,” he admitted,\r\nfinally. “Dey bofe inside de house, an’ de fambly, dey on de outside. Dat\r\nwhut mek me come fer you dis time er night.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean that they turned you out?”\r\n\r\n“Yas, honey. I foun’ Cindy an’ de chillen all turn’t out an’ blockaded,\r\nan’ young Marse a shootin’ th’oo de do’ ef anybody speak ter ’im.”\r\n\r\nVirginia leaned back in silence. The crazy old vehicle creaked and\r\nrattled over the rough road. Its one sorry horse made slow progress.\r\n\r\nFairfax Sevier, less than two years older than his sister, Virginia, was\r\na handsome, brilliant, lovable young fellow, endeared to her by the same\r\nqualities and the same odd unexpected little lapses and weak spots which\r\nendlessly charmed and perplexed her in her father.\r\n\r\nThe general was a peculiarly high-minded, honorable man, with all in his\r\ncharacter that makes for good citizenship. He had brought through a youth\r\nwhich was not without its little scattered patches of wild oats, and a\r\nfamously dare-devil military career during the Civil War, an unpollutable\r\nvein of childlike innocency. It was not that he failed to see evil, or to\r\nknow it and understand it. But he saw and knew these things as a child\r\ndoes, intelligent, but unsoiled.\r\n\r\nHis most marked characteristic was a determined disposition to meddle\r\nwith the affairs of no human creature, to refuse authority, because it\r\nimplied responsibility; to let—as he felicitously phrased it—every fellow\r\ngo to the devil his own gait.\r\n\r\nThis trait made him, among his children, always more a brother than\r\na parent, and was most amusingly displayed during their infancy and\r\nchildhood. He would stand aloof from a small offender who was weltering\r\ndefiantly in infantile crime. Bending his handsome head, he would look\r\nfrom his very considerable height down to the little sinner before him,\r\nand addressing it in the most confidential tone of perfect equality,\r\nremark:\r\n\r\n“You’re making a pretty mess of things there; now, aren’t you? Think you\r\nwant to bust that, do you? Do you know, you’re going to be mighty sorry\r\nwhen you get done this business? And like enough your mother’ll spank\r\nyou, too.”\r\n\r\nWhen, as had occurred twice of late, Fair was led to participate in wild\r\nsprees, this was scarcely the father to whom an appeal for assistance or\r\nthe exercise of salutary authority would be addressed. Virginia could\r\nhear him saying, with a flash of those big dark eyes, “Well, well,\r\nGinnie, I can’t keep him in a glass case, just because he happens to be\r\nmy son. Let him see the folly of it. Let him find out whether he wants\r\nto be a drunkard or not. Every man must do that for himself. Your\r\nconclusion—or mine—that he doesn’t want to do this sort of thing, isn’t\r\nvalid. It could not be incorporated into his character. He must be free\r\nto make some selection of his own.”\r\n\r\nArrived at the cabin, a belated, waning moon showed them the little hut,\r\ndark and silent. “I boun’ y’ Marse Fair done break dat lamp. Hit ’uz\r\nburnin’, time I lef’,” muttered the old man.\r\n\r\nThe sound of their wheels brought a dusky, straggling group to the gate.\r\nThe nucleus of this group was Uncle Vete’s last wife, a round-faced\r\nyoung mulatto woman, with a baby in her arms. About her churned and\r\nbobbed a tribe of various sizes, part of them clinging to her skirts and\r\nwhimpering sleepily.\r\n\r\nCindy was a cheerful soul, with a giggle ready to burst forth upon the\r\nslightest provocation, or no provocation at all. Virginia glanced in\r\ndistress at the baby. “Oh, Cindy,” she cried, “poor little thing! Why,\r\nit’s too bad for you to be out here in the night air with that young\r\nchild.”\r\n\r\n“He ain’t des’ so overly turrible young, Miss Fa’ginny,” returned Cindy\r\nwith her comfortable chuckle. “De big chillen mo’ skeerter dan whut he\r\nis.”\r\n\r\nVirginia, full of indignation, sprang from the carriage. “Tek keer,\r\nhoney!” cautioned Uncle Vete, as she hurried through the yard. “Dey’s\r\nth’ee o’ my youngest sleepin’ dah un’neath dat ’simmon tree.”\r\n\r\nAvoiding the slumberers beneath the persimmon, Virginia made directly for\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n“Hol’ on! Hol’ on! My precious chile! Yo’ gwine get yo’se’f shot!” urged\r\nVete. Cindy screamed, and all the children who were awake began to wail\r\nin concert.\r\n\r\nLike a sensible girl, Virginia stood aside from the panels, back where\r\nthe heavy logs protected her. (“An’ one dem shots might sail th’oo de\r\nchinkin’ des’ easy ez not!” Cindy whimpered.) She struck on the door and\r\ncried, “Fair—Fairfax! Open this door!”\r\n\r\nThe answer came in the form of a bullet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  “Buddy,” she said, huskily, “Buddy, dear, I brought a hack out for you.”\r\n]\r\n\r\nAt the report, Cindy uttered a yell so efficient and comprehensive that\r\nVirginia supposed her no less than mortally wounded. The children, even\r\nthose lying so soundly asleep on the ground that they had not been\r\nwakened when Virginia stepped almost upon them, rose up and fled to their\r\nmother’s wide-spread, sheltering arms, like a brood of alarmed chickens\r\nfleeing from a hawk.\r\n\r\n“Eph’um! Bandoline! Baxter! Pearline! Commodory? Whey is you-all—whey is\r\nyou-all? Oh, Lawdy! _Lawdy!_ I is got mo’ child’en dan dis! I _knows_ I’s\r\ngot mo’ child’en dan whut dis is! Young Marse done kill some on ’em!”\r\nrose Cindy’s excited shriek.\r\n\r\nThere came a second shot, before Virginia rapped again, crying angrily,\r\n“It is I, Virginia. Put up your pistol and open the door!”\r\n\r\nAfter a very long silence within the hut. “I ’spects dey done napped\r\noff,” mildly suggested Uncle Vete. Virginia was preparing to knock again,\r\nwhen a little gust of wind arising, the door swung silently open, showing\r\nthat it had been unbarred for some time.\r\n\r\nVirginia stepped into the room, carrying one of the carriage lamps and\r\nunheeding Uncle Vete’s caution to “Go easy, honey, an’ holler ’fo’ you\r\ngit inside, so dey know who comin’.”\r\n\r\nFair’s companion lay sprawled upon the gay patchwork quilt of Cindy’s\r\nbest bed. He was, or pretended to be, sleeping heavily. The hack driver\r\nwould have to be called if he was to be roused and gotten into the\r\nvehicle.\r\n\r\nAt the table, his head among half-filled and empty glasses, and the wreck\r\nof a poker game, sat Fairfax Sevier. Virginia went with averted eyes past\r\nthe bed to her brother, and shook him by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Buddy,” she said huskily, “Buddy, dear, I brought a hack out for you.\r\nCan you walk to it?”\r\n\r\n“Who’s goin’—take care—Parke? Parke’s been drinkin’,” explained poor\r\nFair, with something like a whimper.\r\n\r\nVirginia turned to the bed; and contempt fell cool upon her suffering. A\r\nface in drunken slumber is not calculated to command respect, even to win\r\nmuch sympathy.\r\n\r\nThe girl took the shock like the daughter of warriors that she was. “Does\r\nParke Winchester drink now?” she inquired, finally, of the negro.\r\n\r\nAgain Vete stole that quick, side-long glance at her. “I ain’t never\r\nknowed de time Marse Parke quit,” he returned finally. “He might fool de\r\nwhite folks ’bout hit, but he ain’t take dat trouble wid de niggers. Him\r\nan’ Marse Fair been at my house mo’ dan onct lately.”\r\n\r\nParke, then, had not only never given up his drinking; he had been\r\nactually initiating Fairfax Sevier into the great and inglorious guild of\r\ntopers, while he deceived the sister with promises that he would find who\r\nit was Fair drank with and look after the boy.\r\n\r\nShe was free; but not yet could her heart rise to the knowledge. The\r\nbowed, boyish figure before her, the degradation of that sleeper upon the\r\nnegro’s poor bed—these left her very pitiful. “He’ll be quiet and behave\r\nhimself now, Uncle Vete.” she said; “I’ll take Fair with me—we can’t move\r\nhim,” indicating Winchester. “Let him sleep.”\r\n\r\n“O, yassum, yassum. He be all right in de mawnin’. He been all right\r\nternight, ef I could jest er got hol’ ’er ’im. Dishyer negoshulatin’ wid\r\n’er man th’oo er do’, an’ him er doin’ his talkin’ wid er gun, hit’s\r\nunsartin kin’ er wuyck.”\r\n\r\nStill in a daze Virginia picked up a pistol from the floor, turned the\r\ncylinder to see that it was unloaded, and dropped it into the pocket of\r\nParke’s light overcoat.\r\n\r\nAt the action, Fair showed his first consciousness of her presence\r\n“You’ll get yourself shot one—these days, Virginia,” he muttered, half\r\nirritably, half penitently. “—’dvise you—let such things ’lone.” And one\r\ncould not have said whether he meant, by this, her present handling of\r\nthe firearm itself, her former reckless demand that he open the door, or\r\nher presence on such a scene.\r\n\r\nUncle Vete assured Virginia that he would look after Parke for the night,\r\nand would see that he reached home in the morning. She gently declined\r\nthe old man’s offer to return to town with her, and promised to send\r\nBeelzebub out by Sam, Cindy’s eldest, who was acting as house-boy at the\r\nSevier home. The drive in the night air, and Virginia’s presence somewhat\r\nsobered her brother. “Does dad know?” he asked, as they neared home.\r\n\r\n“I didn’t wake him,” responded Virginia.\r\n\r\nFair turned, as he lay with his head against her shoulder. He was\r\nbeginning to be deathly sick—the end of all Fair’s essays at drinking.\r\n“You’re a good girl, Virginia. Mighty good girl. I reckon you’ll get your\r\nreward in heaven.”\r\n\r\nBut, driving home under the stars, freed from a self-imposed bond, warned\r\nthat she might in future protect this well-beloved sinner whose head lay\r\non her breast, ready now to accept the love of the man she loved, with no\r\nshadow on her conscience—Virginia felt that she had her reward here, now\r\nand in this world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              THE SPINNER.\r\n\r\n                           BY ELOISE PICKETT.\r\n\r\n\r\n               Wearied to death of my thoughts!\r\n               Is there none, in this epoch of wondrous wares,\r\n               Will sell me a fair, sweet dream?\r\n\r\n               I summoned my spirit, this morn, to be chid\r\n               For her endless weaving of gloom;\r\n               But she lifted me retrospective eyes,\r\n               Burning and dry (for the tears, dammed back,\r\n               Have found them a pool in my heart);\r\n               Her face was wan, and her mouth was set\r\n               In the hard, thin line of resolve.\r\n               And I left unsaid my stern rebuke,\r\n               But her answer cried loud in her mien:\r\n               “_I_ weave; but the warp and the woof are thine;\r\n               Thou madest them yesterday.”\r\n               And so I watch, with sickening hope,\r\n               As her busy fingers ply\r\n               ’Mongst threads from the throbbing Other Days,\r\n               And wisps from the ominous Days to Come,\r\n               And skeins from the stagnant Now.\r\n\r\n               Wearied to death of my thoughts!\r\n               Is there none, in this epoch of cunning skill,\r\n               Can weave me thought-fabrics fair?\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                             MEN OF AFFAIRS\r\n\r\n\r\n                            Joseph W. Bailey.\r\n\r\nOne of the most youthful members of the government’s gravest and\r\nmost august legislative body is Senator Joseph W. Bailey, a typical\r\nrepresentative of the biggest, the breeziest and the most untrammeled,\r\nif not the most patriotic and progressive commonwealth in the Union. A\r\nnatural leader, an orator of plausibility and power and a politician\r\nof resource and acumen, he is besides admittedly one of the ablest\r\nconstitutional lawyers in public life.\r\n\r\nThough a native of Mississippi and a legal product of Cumberland\r\nUniversity, Tennessee, Senator Bailey is a Texan seemingly to the manner\r\nborn. He looks, speaks, thinks and feels Texas, and having won his spurs\r\nso creditably in the congressional jousts his people have gratefully\r\nrecognized his talents by entrusting him with the higher responsibilities\r\nof senator.\r\n\r\nWhile Senator Bailey is a virile product of the present and coming\r\ngeneration in the South he has not been inclined to relinquish the\r\nhabits, dress and thought of the passing regime and his picturesque\r\npersonality is doubtless as readily recognized by resident of and\r\nvisitor to Washington as any other public character of the times. In\r\nno particular do his old-school propensities more emphatically display\r\nthemselves than in his native love for rural life and natural objects.\r\nHis chief hobby comprises the maintenance of an expansive estate whereon\r\nhe rears the sportive thoroughbred, so dear to the heart of the rural\r\nSoutherner, and whereon he spends in the open very much of his leisure\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nSenator Bailey is a close student of men, politics and affairs, and\r\nis of the South, social, though he has no taste for the conventional\r\nsociety of the city.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            James D. Porter.\r\n\r\nFor nearly half a century has the Honorable James D. Porter figured\r\neminently but modestly as a public servant politically, civilly and\r\ncommercially. A native of Tennessee, in which State he has spent nearly\r\nall of his eventful life, he was born at Paris, in 1828, and was admitted\r\nto the bar in 1859. With a disposition toward the public service, from\r\na State legislator he became a circuit judge, and from the bench he\r\nascended to the gubernatorial chair, which he was twice called upon to\r\noccupy. His large and worthy talents coming to the notice of President\r\nCleveland, he was invited during his first term to serve as Assistant\r\nSecretary of State, which he did with such satisfaction as to receive\r\nduring the President’s second term his credentials as the government’s\r\nofficial representative to Chili, in which capacity he attracted\r\nattention by his tactful reestablishment of friendly relations between\r\nthe two countries.\r\n\r\nIn the active commercial affairs of life he has been likewise prominent,\r\nbeing sometime president of the Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis\r\nRailroad Company, and as a soldier of the gray he gallantly participated\r\nin many of the fiercest conflicts of the war as Adjutant General under\r\nGeneral Frank Cheatham.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HON. JOSEPH W. BAILEY.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn 1901 he was selected by virtue of his wide experience in affairs,\r\nexecutive ability, character and attainments, as the most suitable head\r\nof the great Peabody benefaction to the cause of Southern education,\r\nand he is successfully rounding his period of long and devoted public\r\nservice to the administration of this popular munificence as President\r\nof the Peabody Normal College and University of Nashville. With every\r\nassurance of early success he is now engaged in raising from the State of\r\nTennessee, the City of Nashville, and by popular subscription, $250,000\r\nwhich, when attained, will carry with it a permanent endowment of a\r\nmillion dollars from the Peabody estate. President Porter is a man of\r\ndistinguished bearing and impressive address.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JAMES D. PORTER.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                             Joseph W. Folk.\r\n\r\nMissouri’s young governor has received probably more free and favorable\r\npublicity than any other citizen of the Republic, and the public is so\r\nwell informed as to his life and record that anything said of him here\r\nwould be merely cumulative and by way of favorable repetition. It is\r\ngratifying to command the approval of friends and partisans, but it is\r\na delicate and trying obligation to have to live up to the encomiums of\r\nnon-partisans and erstwhile opponents. With nothing but good said of\r\nhis ability and integrity, Governor Folk’s position in politics, which\r\nnow has a decided national aspect, presents a most interesting field of\r\nspeculation to the student of politics and affairs.\r\n\r\nFirst coming into local prominence in St. Louis as an able and fearless\r\ncriminal prosecutor whom a powerful and never-before-thwarted partisan\r\npolitical machine could not influence or intimidate, Governor Folk\r\ndeveloped into national prominence through his relentless warfare upon\r\nthe local boodling regime, his successes influencing municipal reforms\r\nthroughout the country and rendering him so strong with the masses of\r\nstatesmen regardless of political complexion, that they triumphantly\r\nelevated him to the gubernatorial station in the face of an otherwise\r\nastonishing landslide in the other direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  JOSEPH W. FOLK.\r\n]\r\n\r\nGovernor Folk is a native of Brownsville, Tenn., where he was born about\r\nthirty-seven years ago, and is a product of purely Southern environment,\r\nrearing and education. Graduating from the Vanderbilt University law\r\nschool fifteen years ago, he started at about the lowest and roughest\r\nrung of the ladder, a struggling young country lawyer in his native\r\ntown. In quest of opportunities more in keeping with his talents and\r\nambitions, he soon joined the large Tennessee colony in St. Louis, not\r\nlong thereafter attaining to some local notice as a political leader by\r\nbeing elected president of the representative Democratic organization.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WARREN A. CANDLER.\r\n]\r\n\r\nIt is truly said that all great human successes are a combination of\r\nfortuitous circumstance, and the genius to take advantage thereof.\r\nGovernor Folk’s mastery of a complicated local situation wherein he\r\nrepresented a supposed hopeless political movement, turned seeming defeat\r\ninto a brilliant victory, and he was elected District Attorney, since\r\nwhich time his record is known to the country at large.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           Warren A. Candler.\r\n\r\nA virile and dominant figure in Southern religious life is Rev. Warren\r\nAkin Candler, youngest bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South.\r\nOf a family probably second to none in Georgia from the standpoint of\r\nthe prominence of its sons in public life in that State to-day, Bishop\r\nCandler was born forty-eight years ago in Carroll County. Educated\r\nat Emory College, from which he graduated with first honors in 1875,\r\nhe immediately entered the ministry, ascending rapidly the ladder of\r\necclesiastical promotion from the humblest rural circuit to the most\r\ninfluential urban charge. From presiding elder of the Dahlonega and\r\nOxford districts he served for two years in the editorial field as\r\nassistant editor of the _Christian Advocate_ in Nashville. In 1888 he\r\nwas called to the very large activity of presiding over the destinies\r\nof Emory College, his _alma mater_, which institution enjoyed during\r\nthe decade of his administration its highest period of strength and\r\nusefulness.\r\n\r\nWith a distinguished record in all vital departments of his church\r\nlabors, Bishop Candler’s early elevation to the bishopric when barely\r\npast forty years of age was a merited and logical testimonial to his\r\neminent capacity for religious leadership and organization. This exalted\r\npromotion came to him at the hands of the Baltimore Conference of 1898.\r\n\r\nBesides being a pulpit orator of vigor and lucidity, Bishop Candler\r\nis a luminous expositor of secular themes and has rounded out a very\r\nbusy career by producing several well-known religious and general\r\npublications, including a “History of Sunday Schools,” “Georgia’s\r\nEducational Work,” “Christus Auctor,” “High Living and High Lives,” and\r\n“Great Revivals and the Great Republic.”\r\n\r\nBishop Candler’s official residence is Atlanta.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  RICHMOND PEARSON HOBSON.\r\n]\r\n\r\n  Richmond Pearson Hobson, who contributes the following\r\n  thoughtful paper to the MAGAZINE, is so well known to our\r\n  readers that it is hardly necessary to say anything here by way\r\n  of comment upon his eventful history. Since his retirement from\r\n  the navy, Captain Hobson has devoted much attention to political\r\n  affairs, and it is safe to predict that his services to the\r\n  public will be marked by the earnestness and devotion to duty\r\n  which brought him his well-merited fame as an officer in the\r\n  United States navy.—ED.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             COTTON AND WAR.\r\n\r\n      [Part of an address delivered by Mr. Hobson before the Cotton\r\n                   Growers’ Association last January.]\r\n\r\n                       By Richmond Pearson Hobson.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe price of cotton, like other prices, is settled by the relation\r\nof supply and demand. In face of the sudden depression, due to the\r\nincreased volume of supply in the large crop, we are liable to overlook\r\nand underestimate the importance of the factors influencing the demand.\r\nSojourning about the world has convinced me that the factors of demand\r\nare more pliable and more accessible than those of supply. In truth, a\r\nsingle factor reducing demand, the war in the Orient, is responsible\r\nfor depression amounting to from 7 to 8 cents a pound, while the total\r\ndepression due to the big crop is scarcely more than 3 cents a pound.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the question of adjusting the supply for the next year,\r\ncannot be intelligently settled until after investigation of the probable\r\ndemand.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I invite your attention for a few minutes to the question of\r\ndemand, and especially to the factor of war, since we are now in the\r\npresence of the great struggle in the Orient.\r\n\r\nThe old sources of demand, Europe and America, have gone on slowly\r\nincreasing with the increase of population, and the rise of the standard\r\nof comfort, though a check was sustained by the outbreak of the Boer War,\r\nwhich saw a falling off of over one million bales in the consumption of\r\nthe united commodities. This slow increase in demand has been more than\r\nbalanced by the steady increase in supply, coming chiefly from the larger\r\nacreage and larger increase of commercial fertilizers in the South.\r\nConsequently, for several decades the price of cotton has had a steady\r\ntrend downward. It was only when new demands came from new markets that\r\nthe price started upward. The chief of the new markets are those of the\r\nOrient. Japan has made great strides in the cotton mill industry, until\r\nat the outbreak of the present war, she was consuming over $50,000,000\r\nworth of cotton annually.\r\n\r\nBut more important even than Japan, has been the new market of China,\r\nwhich, when the present war came, amounted to $90,000,000 annually,\r\nchiefly coarse cotton goods, of which a large part has been furnished by\r\nSouthern mills.\r\n\r\nThese two markets have come to consume more cotton than is produced by\r\nAlabama and Mississippi combined. It is not surprising, therefore, that\r\nin spite of the steadily increasing production, the price has steadily\r\nrisen. The rise has been especially marked since the Boxer disturbances\r\nthat were followed by a new impulsion in the opening up of China.\r\n\r\nAs great as this new market has become, it is only in its infancy.\r\n\r\nIf China were opened up, free to the commerce of all nations, its four\r\nhundred and thirty millions of industrial people, would rise from a five\r\ncent wage basis to a 20 cent, 30 cent, or even 40 or 50 cent basis, and\r\nthe average man, instead of having his present outfit of about a half\r\nsuit of cotton clothes, would have four or five whole suits, which are\r\npulled on in multiple numbers, according to the coldness of the day.\r\nThis would so increase the world’s demand for cotton that even with a\r\n20,000,000 bale crop, the price could be hardly kept down to 20 cents per\r\npound.\r\n\r\nThe picture here disclosed is not visionary. Thousands of Chinese worked\r\nunder my inspection for months reconstructing gun-boats at Hong Kong. The\r\nabove estimates of their industrial capacity are conservative. Knowing\r\nboth peoples, I do not hesitate to say that the industrial capacity of\r\na Chinaman is far greater than that of a Japanese, while there are over\r\nten times as many Chinese as Japanese. Moreover, the facilities for\r\ncommunication are advancing. The eyes of the world have been thrown upon\r\nChina, and the point of the wedge has been entered. A few decades can\r\nsee marvelous growth in this young giant of a market. I estimate that\r\nbefore this century is half turned, China, properly opened up, will add\r\nmore than $5,000,000,000 annually to the world’s commerce, and one of\r\nthe chief staples of this commerce will be cotton, first the goods, then\r\nthe raw materials, creating a consumption as great as that of all Europe\r\ncombined.\r\n\r\nBut this greatest of all coming cotton markets is the most sensitive\r\nand the most exposed. When war broke out in the Orient last year, it\r\nwas clear that Japan and Russia, under the exhaustion, would decline\r\nin buying power, and that the thriving cotton trade of Manchuria would\r\nbe cut off entirely, while the fate of China might become involved and\r\nendanger the whole Chinese market. Consequently, the day after war was\r\ndeclared, cotton slumped 5 cents a pound, and started on its downward\r\npath, going off nearly 8 cents a pound before indications came in of the\r\nlarge crop, which brought about a further decline of about 3 cents a\r\npound.\r\n\r\nThe grievous depression we are passing through must be attributed to the\r\nwar in the Orient. Without war cotton would now be from 12 to 15 cents\r\nper pound, even with the big crop. Think what prosperity this would have\r\nmeant. Can anyone contend that the United States should be indifferent to\r\nthis war? It may be pointed out that our diplomatic moves were masterful,\r\nboth in getting the powers to commit themselves to limiting the war zone,\r\nand to preserving the integrity of China, and also in negotiating, by\r\ncable, treaties with China, not Russia, opening up Mukden, Dalny and\r\nAntung, in Manchuria, thus recognizing Chinese sovereignty, and placing\r\nthe United States in the same attitude as Japan, in standing for the\r\nevacuation of Manchuria. Unfortunately, our diplomatic moves had but\r\nlittle deterrent effect, not being backed by an adequate navy. Had we\r\npossessed an adequate navy, I am bold to say that Manchuria would have\r\nbeen evacuated and the war would not have come to disturb the earth and\r\nbring the present depression over the Southern people.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to point out that our losses already incurred\r\nwould have covered many fields over the cost of such a navy.\r\n\r\nBut as great as are these losses they cannot compare with the greater\r\nlosses that may lie ahead, if the present drift of events should go\r\nunchecked and lead to a general war over the division of China.\r\n\r\nNaturally, the Continental powers of Europe do not wish to have to\r\ncompete with our industrial nation on the basis of an equal footing in\r\nthis great market. They have, therefore, combined to seize China by\r\nforce, and partition it among themselves, leaving the industrial nations\r\nout.\r\n\r\nThe first step taken in this direction came at the conclusion of the\r\nwar between China and Japan, when the Continental powers intervened to\r\ndespoil Japan of the fruits of victory, preventing the consummation\r\nof the treaty of Shimonosoki, that would have ceded to Japan part of\r\nManchuria, including the Liaotung Peninsula with Port Arthur. Soon Russia\r\ncame to occupy the same territory wrested from Japan, Germany seized\r\nKiaochao, and part of the Shantung Peninsula, Italy attempted to seize a\r\nChinese port, and France became active on the frontier of Indo-China.\r\n\r\nThe next step in the seizure of China is planned for the present war.\r\nIndeed, the seizure of China is the very purpose of the war, and to this\r\nend Russia is conducting her war operations.\r\n\r\nThe chief aim of this year’s campaign has been to change the public\r\nopinion of Europe. Thus it is that Russia has conducted a pre-arranged\r\nsystem of retreats, and that the inspired press of Europe has raised the\r\nhue and cry of “Yellow Peril,” with such success that the peoples now\r\nstand with their governments on the side of Russia. The combination is\r\nready to move, and we can expect renewed reports of Chinese violation,\r\nof neutrality, of Chinese disturbances and Japanese intrigues in China,\r\nRussia reporting upon the affairs in Mongolia, France upon the affairs\r\nin Kwangsi, and Germany in Shantung and Chili. The agents of these\r\npowers will probably facilitate and exaggerate the Chinese disturbances,\r\nand then upon the pretext of preventing massacre and a general Chinese\r\nuprising, the armies by pre-arranged program will enter and occupy the\r\nProvinces of China, never again to leave.\r\n\r\nOpposition on the part of Great Britain is evidently anticipated, and the\r\ninexplicable seizure of British ships, followed later by the inexplicable\r\nfiring upon British fishing vessels, appears as part of a plan to excite\r\nBritish indignation, so that at the opportune moment, the British may be\r\nthe more easily provoked to commit an act of war which would at once put\r\ninto operation the Russian treaty of alliance with France, and this would\r\nbe the signal for Germany, Austria-Hungary and Italy to join Russia and\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThus the present war is producing a grouping that imperils the balance\r\nof power, placing a heavy preponderance on the side of the military as\r\nagainst the industrial nations or on the side of war as against the peace\r\nforces. No thoughtful observer can fail to see here all the elements for\r\na world war; nor can we look except with alarm upon the declination by\r\nthe military powers of the interstate to the proposed second convention\r\nof The Hague, and the Russian note complaining of alleged violation of\r\nneutrality by China. It is idle to imagine that the United States, the\r\nforemost industrial power, with more at stake in the Orient than any\r\nnation, could look on with indifference.\r\n\r\nWe should awaken to the full significance of the events gathering in the\r\nOrient. The two antagonistic systems, militarism and industrialism, are\r\ngathering for a death struggle. The Orient is the battle ground—China is\r\nthe objective.\r\n\r\nIf militarism succeeds in intrenching itself upon the yellow race,\r\nsecuring the myriads upon which to levy for men and for means, then it\r\nwill perpetuate its harsh reign for centuries yet to come.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if thwarted in obtaining the spoils of war and left\r\nsimply to a fair competition, militarism will be unable to hold its own,\r\nand will be driven to the wall, and be compelled to disarm by the great\r\neconomic forces of commerce and industry, and we can then confidently\r\nexpect the establishment of general and enduring peace long ere this\r\ncentury is gone.\r\n\r\nWhat would be the effect upon cotton?\r\n\r\nIf peace is restored and maintained, cotton will start again upon its\r\nupward course and in a few years, with such a vast demand as China would\r\ncreate, I am conservative in saying that the price would pass the 20 cent\r\nmark, and remain above this mark, no matter how large the crop.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if events are allowed to drift on and a general war\r\ncomes, cotton would become a drug on the market, even though reduced\r\nacreage, calamity and distress would spread over the South. Indeed, with\r\nmilitarism uppermost, wars and rumors of wars would continually disturb\r\nthe world, nations would be exhausted and lose in their buying capacity,\r\nand the myriads of helpless peoples would pass under the military yoke\r\nand remain unable to buy clothing. The greatest source of Southern\r\nprosperity would be permanently blighted, and a serious blow would be\r\nstruck at the general prosperity of America, and at the happiness of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances, when it is a question of 3½ cent cotton or 25\r\ncent cotton, I do not hesitate to say that the solid influence of the\r\nSouth should be felt for having our country act promptly and vigorously,\r\nto use every proper means to restore the balance of the world on the\r\nside of peace, and to bring about the ending of the present war and the\r\nrestoration of Manchuria to the commerce of the world.\r\n\r\nIt only remains for us to refer summarily to the factors of supply. It\r\nis practically certain that the South will continue to produce the bulk\r\nof the world’s cotton. During the Civil War, when cotton was over $1.00\r\na pound, persistent efforts were made all over the world to develop\r\ncotton growing, but in vain. The Gulf Stream on one side, and a vast\r\ncontinent on the other, produce climatic conditions for cotton culture\r\nnot duplicated anywhere else in the world. We may expect some increase\r\nin the output of Egypt on account of developing irrigation, and possibly\r\na temporary increase in the output of India, and other secondary sources\r\ndue to the recent high price, but the present depression will tend to\r\ncheck this movement. Therefore, the South may be expected to continue to\r\nproduce over 80 per cent of the world’s supply so that the question of\r\nsupply lies in our own hands.\r\n\r\nThe two factors in determining the supply are the seasons and the\r\nacreage. While the general law of the average holds, history shows that\r\nthe temperate zone is liable to wide fluctuations in seasons, which it is\r\nimpossible to foresee. The recourse to offset the unhappy consequences of\r\nwide fluctuations is a reservoir or fly-wheel, into which the fat years\r\ncan pour their supplies for making up the deficit of the lean years. The\r\nuncertainty of cotton demand, hinging upon war or peace, is now added to\r\nthe uncertainty of the cotton season. Recourse to storage is therefore\r\nabsolutely necessary, and a wide system of warehouse storage should be\r\ncreated. I will not endeavor to go into the details of such a system, but\r\nventure to suggest that it should be organized on bedrock principles,\r\nand operate on the securest lines, so that a warehouse certificate would\r\nbe absolutely safe and universally negotiable. Lessons could probably be\r\nlearned from the systems in use in pig iron storage, where the market\r\nis also subject to wide fluctuations. The American Pig Iron Storage\r\nWarehouse Co. would probably be the best pattern.\r\n\r\nThe factors of acreage should be carefully investigated before any\r\nradical action is taken.\r\n\r\nI know it is best for a farmer to have a diversified crop as it is best\r\nfor a city to have diversified industries, and it is wise for a farmer,\r\nlike a nation, to produce the necessities required for home consumption.\r\nThe present fearful depression will doubtless have a partial benefit\r\nin this direction, but I fear too much importance is now being given\r\nto this question. While I would urge the farmers to diversify their\r\ncrops, I would hesitate to recommend a sweeping reduction in the world’s\r\nproduction. In fact, as an economic principle, there can be no such thing\r\nas over production at this stage of the world’s progress, particularly\r\nin the great world’s staples, like those of food and clothing. For\r\ngenerations to come mankind, on the whole, will go hungry and half\r\nnaked. The true principle is not to try to reduce the product but to\r\nprovide for a general increasing buying capacity and particularly for\r\nthe case of the undeveloped peoples of the earth, by increasing their\r\nopportunities to work for the world’s market, and to make the wages\r\nnecessary to purchase the products. If we could only be sure that peace\r\nis to prevail, so that the market of China would be restored, and could\r\ngo on increasing, I would not hesitate to urge against any reduction in\r\nacreage. On the contrary, I would urge a steady increase, for no matter\r\nhow great the increase, the supply would never keep up with the growth of\r\ndemand. As conditions now stand, however, I believe conservative action\r\nis advisable—action that would lean rather toward the side of preparation\r\nto store up for future use the surplus, if war should come, than to\r\nmaterially reduce the acreage, and my advice to the individual farmer is\r\nto become independent and diversify his crop, and then plant his usual\r\nacreage in cotton.\r\n\r\nIt may be pointed out that one effective way to offset the losses from\r\nlow-priced cotton is for the South to invest more and more in cotton\r\nmills, that benefit from these prices, and the logic of the situation\r\nwould have cotton growers invest their available capital and saving in\r\ncotton manufacture. The true aim of the South should be not only to\r\nproduce the cotton, but the clothing for the world. And every country in\r\nthe South should have cotton mill industries organized with local capital\r\nand should develop and educate its labor for the high grades as well as\r\ncoarse.\r\n\r\nSumming up, the general conclusions and recommendations are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The cotton growers should have a wide, permanent organization with a\r\ngeneral convention once a year.\r\n\r\n2. A standing committee composed of, say, two members for each cotton\r\ngrowing state, should be appointed to investigate and report each year\r\nupon the existing and prospective conditions of supply of cotton.\r\n\r\n3. A similar committee should be appointed to investigate and report\r\neach year upon the existing and prospective conditions of the demand for\r\ncotton.\r\n\r\n4. There should be established a comprehensive and carefully organized\r\nstorage warehouse system.\r\n\r\n5. The great agents for increasing the price of cotton are _peace_,\r\nprosperity and civilization.\r\n\r\n6. The arch-enemy of the cotton growers is _war_. The permanent cause\r\nof cotton must look to the peoples beyond the sea, especially China.\r\nThe fate of China hangs upon peace or war—peace or war depends upon\r\nAmerica—America’s influence depends upon her navy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE MASTER-HAND.\r\n\r\n                          BY GARNET NOEL WILEY\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Sometimes at half-mast, all my hours\r\n                    A drooping banner seem to lie\r\n                  In listless folds, along the calm,\r\n                    Still blue of boundless stagnancy.\r\n                  Grieving, I think, because somewhat\r\n                    Within my soul is near to die.\r\n\r\n                  Enow the master-hand of Love\r\n                    Plucks at my banner’s guiding string,\r\n                  Until it flutters in the breeze,\r\n                    And pulses like a living thing.\r\n                  Joyous, I think, because somewhat\r\n                    Within my soul hath need to sing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE BOY IN GRAY.\r\n\r\n              By Will N. Harben, Author of “Abner Daniel.”\r\n\r\n\r\nOne day in midsummer I went to visit the old plantation of the Lansdale\r\nfamily. The moment I entered the cooling shade of the tall trees on the\r\nlawn something seemed to tell me that I was on a spot hallowed by human\r\nsuffering and misfortune.\r\n\r\nThe house had two stories and an L. There was a long veranda in front,\r\nthe roof of which was supported by large white columns. My interest in\r\nthe place was due to the fact that prior to the Civil War it had been\r\nthe rendezvous of the aristocracy for miles around it. The wide halls\r\nand spacious rooms had once rung with gay laughter, sweet music and the\r\ntripping of feet in merry dances.\r\n\r\nBehind the uninhabited dwelling the shrubbery had grown into a riotous\r\ntangle. Choice rose bushes had been dwarfed and choked to barrenness by\r\nan army of interlopers—Jamestown weeds, hollyhocks and giant sunflowers.\r\nOnly here and there might be seen a pale-leaved geranium or a dandelion\r\nin the edges of the gravel walks, now almost completely overgrown. Here,\r\nbent to the earth, lay a decayed lattice, pulled down by a fragrant\r\njasmine; in another place stood the rotten remains of what had once been\r\na graceful summerhouse.\r\n\r\nAs I wended my way further from the old mansion the silence and shade\r\nseemed to thicken and blend into the pervading melancholy. When about\r\ntwo hundred yards from the house, I suddenly came upon a log cabin\r\nalmost hidden from view behind a close growth of gnarled and twisted\r\napple trees. In the door sat an old negro man. His face was pinched and\r\nwrinkled and his eyes, peeping through their brown slits, looked like\r\nblue beads. With his old bell-shaped hat on his knee, he glanced up in\r\nsurprise, and, rising quickly he hobbled towards me, bowing politely.\r\n\r\n“Who dis heer?” he asked, as he shaded his eyes with his hand and peered\r\nup at me. “It seems like I don’t know you, but you may know who I is.\r\nMost white folks knows me, dough, thank de Lawd! I carn’t see you good,\r\nsuh; my sight is failin’ me powerful fast.”\r\n\r\n“I’m a stranger in this part of the South,” I told him. “I have heard\r\nso much about the Lansdale family that I wanted to see their old home;\r\nthat’s all. I hope I’m not intruding.”\r\n\r\n“Lawdamussy, bless you, no, suh!” he replied quickly. “You is welcome\r\nto roam ’round all you want. Ef ’twuz des in de ol’ time, suh, my young\r\nmarster, er my ol’ marster, would done met you down de carriage drive an’\r\n’scort’ you in an’ took yo’ hat an’ pass roun’ de wine an’ cigars, but”\r\n(a long sigh escaped his lips, and he shook his head sadly), “but dat\r\ntime done gone, suh—dat time done gone.”\r\n\r\n“Tell me something about your master’s family,” I said, taking a chair\r\nnear his own at the cabin door. “I have heard that Mr. Lansdale’s only\r\nson was killed during the war when he was hardly more than a child.”\r\n\r\n“Dat so, suh,” the old man answered in a tender tone, as he sat down in\r\nhis chair and leaned it back against the wall. “Dat was Marse Eddie. He\r\nwasn’t fifteen year old when he ’listed. It all come o’ him actually\r\nitchin’ ter be a soldier from his cradle up. Long ’fo’ de war was ever\r\nstart up, when he wasn’t ten year old he had soldierin’ in his head, an’\r\nnobody couldn’t stop ’im. His maw say he wouldn’t study his school books\r\nlessen dey tell ’bout wars an’ bloodshed. Away back den Marse Eddie’s\r\nsoldierin’ was de chief talk ’mongst de slaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  “He wasn’t fifteen year old when he ’listed.”\r\n]\r\n\r\n“He didn’t keer fur hosses, ur fishin’, ur huntin’ like other boys, but\r\nef you des mention soldierin’ he would pick up his ears an’ open his\r\neyes. He used to had his army, an’ what you reckon dat army was made\r\nout’n, suh? Nothin’, ’cept ten ur ’leven pickaninnies in deir shut-tails\r\nan’ bare laigs. But, suh, dey would march round dis plantation tell dey\r\nraidy to drap in deir tracks to please dat boy. An’ dey didn’t know no\r\nmo’ ’bout what a rail army was dan a blind kitten. But ’fore he got thoo\r\nwid um, Marse Eddie had um trained so dey will march straight in er\r\nbreast-line, ur wheel round, double-quick step, an’ charge bayonets when\r\nhe give de command des de same as reg’lar troups.\r\n\r\n“Des as soon as he had his breakfust in de mawnin’ Marse Eddie ’ud tramp\r\nout’n de house wid his hat pinned up on one side an’ his pants stuck in\r\nhis red-top boots an’ old Miss’ shawl flung acrost his shoulder to make\r\n’im look like a general.\r\n\r\n“He would al’ays find his army at de front do’ pushin’ an’ kickin’ one\r\n’nother, all um tryin’ to be haid in de row. But when dey see ’im dey\r\nstand mighty quiet kase he done whacked deir laigs too often wid his\r\nstick sword. Den Marse Eddie ud stand on de veranda wid his maw ur Miss\r\nGrace long side o’ him while he call de roll. It uster sound mighty funny\r\n’fo’ any of us know how it was gwine to end.\r\n\r\n“James Lansdale! Heer! Thomas Lansdale! Heer! Abrum Lansdale! Heer! Tobe\r\nLansdale! Heer! an’ so on dey all answered deir names. Old Marster listen\r\nto ’em one day while he was smokin’ on de veranda an’ low to ’im, he\r\ndid—des jokin’: ’Son’, he say, smilin’ like he al’ays did, ’I do hope\r\nan’ pray you won’t have no diverses in battle, kase it would be too bad\r\nto had we-all’s kin-folks in Firginny read in de papers dat so many\r\nLansdales is kilt in war. Seem like dey is a sight of um in yo’ army.’\r\n\r\n“Young Marster didn’t say nothin’ but it sorter made ’im mad. He got raid\r\nin de face, an ordered de string o’ darkies to shoulder deir stick guns\r\nan’ march off todes de spring-house, whar he say he count on campin’ out\r\nan’ ’rangin’ ’bout buildin’ abridge cross de branch so dey kin git at de\r\nenemy prowlin’ round. Dat’s de way he carried on, an’ all de darkies in\r\nhis crowd held deir haids so high dey wouldn’t speak to de niggers on de\r\nplace j’inin’ we-all’s plantation, an’ dey got so triflin’ dat dey wasn’t\r\nfittin’ fur anything but fightin’ under Marse Eddie.\r\n\r\n“Miss Grace cert’ney did keer mo fur her brother dan she did fur anything\r\nin de worl’, even de young mens dat come to see ’er. Anything Marse Eddie\r\ndo is des right. She made ’im his newniform, an’ flags, an’ his raid\r\nsash, an’ gloried in ’im.\r\n\r\n“He was off in Firginny at his uncle’s when de sho-nough war broke out.\r\nOld Marster had done made up his company in we-all’s settlement an’ was\r\nmost raidy to go. De very same day dat de guns come dat dey was waitin’\r\non, who shall ride up on a hoss des reekin’ wid sweat but Marse Eddie. He\r\nlef’ de hoss in de front yard an’ run in de dinin’ room whar his maw an’\r\nsister was. He kissed um mighty quick an’ strange like an’ den say, ‘Whar\r\nis father?’\r\n\r\n“Old Miss an’ young Miss bofe turn pale an’ trembly, but dey ain’t say\r\na word at fust. Den Marse Eddie say powerful impatient, ‘Grace, whar is\r\nfather?’\r\n\r\n“‘He’s down in de quarter,’ she say an’ den when de boy done lef’ de room\r\nmost as quick as a skeerd rabbit kin jump, de two women look one ’nother\r\nin de face fer a long time powerful still an’ troubled. Den old Miss say,\r\nmighty husky in ’er throat:\r\n\r\n“‘He must not go, Grace; I carn’t stand it; he’s too young—I carn’t stand\r\ndat!’\r\n\r\n“De tears was comin’ in young Miss’ eyes an’ she left ’er maw an’ went\r\nan’ stood in de kitchen do’ to meet Marse Eddie an’ his paw as dey was\r\ncomin’ up de garden walk, talkin’ low an’ arm in arm. Somehow young\r\nMarster looked like he was all at once as old an’ ’sponsible as his paw.\r\nWhen dey was bofe in de house, Miss Grace tuck ’er brurr by de arm an’\r\nled ’im off to one side, an’ I heer ’er say:\r\n\r\n“‘Brurr Eddie, father is goin’ off to fight de Yankees an’ me’n mother\r\ncarn’t live by ourse’ves. You must stay wid us—one is enough to lose.’\r\n\r\n“‘Oh, sister,’ Marse Eddie say, very impatient. ‘Don’t talk nonsense at\r\nsech a serious moment. Father, did you say all yo’ men gwine be raidy in\r\nde mawnin’? We must not had no mistakes. I’m not tired. I believe I’ll\r\ngit a fresh hoss an’ ride round mongst ’em.’\r\n\r\n“Well, suh, dat was de end o’ de women folks tryin’ to ’fluence ’im. It\r\nseem to me dat he was every bit an’ grain as sensible as his pa. It look\r\nlike Marster was too backward ’bout tryin’ to make ’im stay at home. De\r\nnext day all marched off an’ dey tuck all de men slaves ’cep’ me. Dey\r\nlef’ me kase I was too lame to march an’ somebody had to stay at home.\r\n\r\n“Den a whole year went by. Sometimes letters ud come an’ sometimes word\r\nud reach us in one way an’ another. Den old Miss tuck down sick, an’ Miss\r\nGrace kept all de bad news from ’er ’bout de war. Den come a letter from\r\nMarse Eddie hisse’f. He writ dat he is a little wounded in de arm an’ dat\r\nhe got a furlough to come home an’ will be wid us as soon as he kin git\r\nthoo de lines. But de time went by, day in, day out fur a week an’ no mo’\r\nnews ’cep’ old Marster writ dat de boy is done put out fur home some time\r\nback; so dar we is—old Marster say he ain’t in de war, an’ he ain’t got\r\nto we-all.\r\n\r\n“While we-all in dis fix an’ worriment, de Yankee army des swoop down on\r\nus lake a swarm o’ grass-hoppers. Dar wasn’t a single Rebel ’cep’ women\r\nfolks an’ me anywhars around. Den we know dat Marse Eddie is cut off fum\r\nus. While de Yankees is camped round us as thick as fleas, a old man come\r\nto us, he did, an’ said he’d met up wid Marse Eddie one day up in de\r\nmountains what you kin see over dar, an’ ’at he was mighty nigh starved\r\nto death an’ unable to git stuff to eat.\r\n\r\n“Marse Eddie tol’ de man ’at he’d started home on his furlough but was\r\ntuck down sick at a house on de way, an’ when he got so he could travel\r\nan’ come nigh home de Yankees done s’round us so he earn’t git home nur\r\nback to his regiment nuther. So he was des obleeged to stay hidin’ out in\r\nde woods like a wild animal. Dis news got, to ol’ Miss, an’ it made her\r\nwuss an’ we ’lowed she gwine die sho’.\r\n\r\n“One night I woke up kase I heerd somebody walkin’ on de porch, an’ when\r\nI went to de do’ dar is young Miss standin’ dar lookin’ to’ds de Yankee\r\ncamp what you could see fum de’r fires dey kept burnin’ so we couldn’t\r\nslip up on um an’ throttle um in de’r sleep.\r\n\r\n“‘Don’t tell mother, Ham’ she say; ‘po’ thing, she’s very sick, an’ we\r\nmustn’t ’sturb ’er. I carn’t sleep wid all dis on my mind. How do we\r\nknow, Ham, but my po’ brother may be dis minute in gre’t danger? I must\r\nkeep watch kase I know in reason he’ll try to pass thoo de lines some\r\nnight to get to we-all’s, an’, Ham, somebody must be up to receive ’im\r\nan’ hide ’im less’n dey catch ’im an’ try to kill ’im.’\r\n\r\n“She was alraidy a-cryin’, an’ I didn’t have de heart to tell ’er how\r\ndangersome it was to try to pass guards on picket duty, kase I had heerd\r\n’bout one po’ feller gittin’ daylight let thoo ’im while he was tryin’ to\r\ndo it on his all-fours.\r\n\r\n“It was as still, suh, dat night as a graveyard. De wind wasn’t blowin’\r\n’nough to move a blade o’ wavy grass. An’ all of a sudden I heerd a sound\r\nway down de road like somebody’s feet—pit-pat, pit-pat, comin’ nigher an’\r\nnigher. Den we heer somebody a-pantin’ mighty nigh out’n breath.\r\n\r\n“Young Miss laid ’er han’ on ’er breast an’ breathed hard. De sound kept\r\ngittin’ closer an’ closer tell all at once somebody sprung over de fence\r\ninto de yard. My Gawd, it was Marse Eddie, an’ no dead white pusson could\r\nlook paler’n he did an’ so thin an’ raggety.\r\n\r\n“‘Grace,’ he say, blowin hard, ‘is dis you? My Gawd, sister, dey is atter\r\nme. I started to slip thoo de lines an’ dey seed me an’ so I had to run\r\nfur my life. Do you heer um?’\r\n\r\n“We all listen an’ sho ’nough we heerd de Yankees comin’ as fast as dey\r\nkin lick it. Young Miss carn’t speak; she des throwed ’er arms ’roun ’er\r\nbrurr’s neck an’ tried to pull ’im in de house. But he say, ‘No, no; I\r\nmus’ run furder; dey gwine s’arch dis house fust place, kase we-all fur\r\nde Souf—good-bye!’ an’ ’fo’ Miss Grace could open ’er mouf he’s off thoo\r\nde woods an’ out o’ sight in de dark, dough he wasn’t runnin’ out’n a\r\nslow dog-trot kase he was too broke down. In a minute ’bout ten men jump\r\nde fence an’ come to us.\r\n\r\n“‘Here he is!’ one of um say, an’ he stuck a pistol in my face fur de\r\nworl’ like he gwine blow my brains out. Dis was a sho ’nough s’prise to\r\nme, I tell you, fur it was a powerful good chance fur young Miss ter\r\ntell um, yes, I was de one, an’ git um to stop runnin’ after her brurr.\r\nI didn’t know what she was gwine to do ’bout it, but it didn’t suit me\r\none bit. I never seed de line o’ pickets I’d try to run thoo, an’ my time\r\nhadn’t come to die nohow.\r\n\r\n“But one of de men say, ‘No, it was a white man, an’ a reb to boot kase\r\nI seed his face an’ his newniform. Dis is des a’ ol’ nigger dat stays\r\n’roun’ dis house.’ Den he up an’ ’dress young Miss. ‘Young lady,’ he ax\r\n’er, ‘is a man pass heer des now?’\r\n\r\n“Well, suh, I ’lowed she wouldn’t find ’er tongue, she was so bad put\r\nout, but she up an’ say: ‘No, suh, not sence I been standin’ here,’ an’\r\nshe say it as cool as ef she was des givin’ ’im a passin’ s’lute. But I\r\nreckon dat officer seed thoo ’er kase he said: ‘Some o’ you fellers run\r\ndown dat way an’ fo’ of us will s’arch de house. Miss,’ he say to Miss\r\nGrace, ‘we all know you is fur de downfall o’ de republic, an’ you mus’\r\n’scuse me fur not takin’ yo’ word, but we is been fooled so many times by\r\nyou women in de Souf dat we got to be partic’lar.’\r\n\r\n“Wid dat, fo’ of um go thoo we-all’s house fum bottom to top an’ ol’ Miss\r\nwas mighty nigh ’stracted. She riz bodily fum ’er bed an’ fronted um. It\r\nwas a big wonder to me dat dem Yankees ain’t shot ’er daid in ’er tracks\r\nfur de way she belittled um.\r\n\r\n“‘You dirty gang o’ raid-hand murderers an’ cut-th’oats,’ she say,\r\n‘I hope an’ pray high heaven will fall down on you an’ crush you in\r\neverlastin’ punishment. You ain’t satisfied wid takin’ our sons an’\r\nhusbands fum us, but you must go an’ tromple our houses wid yo’ muddy\r\nfeet an’ fo’ce yo’ ugly se’ves into de sick rooms o’ yo’ betters. Dat\r\nshows yo’ raisin’; no Southern gen’man ain’t gwine be so brutish.’\r\n\r\n“‘Now, madam,’ de leader say as cool as a watermelon in a deep spring,\r\n‘des keep on yo’ jacket. You ketch yo’ death wid cold, A sudden change\r\nfum a warm bed is a bad thing whar doctors is so scarce, anyhow. You\r\nbetter not ’cite yo’se’f—’twon’t do a speck o’ good, an’ in fact you\r\nain’t lookin’ well. You act sorter s’picious. Ef dar is a spy in yo’\r\nhouse we gwine have ’im fur our meat, an’ all yo’ rampageousness won’t\r\nstop us. Dough, I make bold to say, madam, dat we-all ud like to have you\r\non we-all’s side. At close range dat tongue o’ yo’n ud beat a grape-gun\r\nall holler.’\r\n\r\n“Ol’ Miss didn’t say anything back. She looked out’n ’er eyes, dough,\r\nlike you seed a balkin’ mule ’fo’ now, mebby, when his laigs is been tied\r\ntogether to break ’im fum kickin’ an’ you stan’ hind ’im wid a whip an’\r\nsorer tap ’im in de flank atter he found out he earn’t kick ’nough to\r\nskeer a hoss-fly off’n his back.\r\n\r\n“Well, dey all go plumb thoo de house widout a speck ur luck, ’cep’ what\r\ndey come acrost in de cupboard. When dey et all dey want an’ is raidy to\r\ngo, de head man say to ol’ Miss: ‘Madam,’ he say, lookin’ at me kinder\r\n’chievous, ‘we got some work in de camp to be done an’ dis ol’ nigger\r\nmus’ go an’ tend to it. We’ll sen’ ’im back in de mawnin’ sho ef he gits\r\nthoo.’\r\n\r\n“Dat ain’t de fust time I had to do odd jobs fur um, an’ I ain’t\r\ns’prised. I had to march back wid one lill swivelly white man dat I could\r\na-mashed twixt my fingers like a skeeter, an’ I would a-tried it, too,\r\nef he hadn’t kep’ a musket level’ on me de whole time. De other soldiers\r\nwent on after Marse Eddie.\r\n\r\n“He’s a spy,’ I heer um say, as dey went off, ’an’ he carn’t git away,\r\nnuther, kase he is s’rounded on all sides an’ day is breakin’.’\r\n\r\n“By de time we got to de camp de sun was ’ginnin’ to rise an’ a kettle\r\ndrummer was out wakin’ um all up wid his clatter. I had to he’p wash\r\ndishes at de officer’s tent, an’ all dat mawnin’ I heerd um axin’ one\r\nanother is de spy done kotch. To’ds dinner de men all come back an’ wid\r\num was po’ Marse Eddie. He was so weakly dey had to mos’ drap ’im along.\r\nPon my word, I don’t b’lieve de boy know who had ’im; he looked so wild\r\nout o’ his raid eyes.\r\n\r\n“Dey tuck ’im to a big tent an’ all de officers got in it and held a\r\ncourt martial—dat’s what dey called it. I couldn’t heer a word dat\r\npassed, but de Lawd know I seed Marse Eddie was in a bad fix, kase dey\r\nwas makin’ sech a big to-do.\r\n\r\n“Terrectly dey all come out de tent. De haid man ’mongst um give a order\r\nan’ ’bout ten men come up wid deir guns an’ formed a line o’ battle. Den\r\ndey marched Marse Eddie out wid his back to a tree. You know, suh, I kin\r\n’member when young Miss an’ ’im used to go to dat selfsame sweetgum when\r\ndey was lill. He used to take his knife an’ gouge out de gum an’ put it\r\ntwixt ’er white teeth an’ she’s say, ‘Quick, Brurr Eddie, give me some\r\ndat’s hard ’fo’ my teeth stick together—dis heer is too saft.’\r\n\r\n“Den young Marster ud take some o’ de dry gum in his fingers, kase it\r\nwouldn’t lay on de knife-blade, an’ when he’d make ’er shet ’er eyes he’d\r\ndrap it in ’er mouf. Yes, suh, I kin ’member dat as plain as ef ’twas\r\nyesterday.\r\n\r\n“Well, when dey got de po’ droopy young man agin de tree, an’ yell at ’im\r\nto hold his haid up, all de big, strappin’ soldiers stand in front an’ de\r\ncaptain drilled um. All deir clothes looked so blue an’ deir buttons an\r\nshoulder straps flashed in de sun like a lookin’-glass in de light. Seem\r\nlike I kin heer de same locust a-singin’ in de woods right now dat was\r\nsingin’ den. De sky was blue, an’ wide open, des like Gawd Almighty done\r\ntore de clouds apart so Marse Eddie’s white soul could git away fum dat\r\nmeasly crowd o’ blood-thirsty cowards. I knowed I couldn’t do a thing to\r\nhelp ’im, an’ I tried to hold steady an’ take one las’ look at my young\r\nMarster, but I couldn’t see any plainer dan you kin thoo a frosty window.\r\nBut when de captain say, ‘Raidy, take aim!’ I looked away. De guns all\r\nwent off wid one crack, an’ when de smoke is ris’ a lill, I seed Marse\r\nEddie settin’ on de groun’ agin de tree wid his haid down des fur de\r\nworld like I seed ’im one day when he’d been watchin’ us cut wheat an’\r\ngot drowsy an’ fell asleep in de shade.\r\n\r\n“Dey tuck ’im off to bury ’im, an’ I went back to work; but I couldn’t\r\ndo it jestice, an’ kept drappin’ de dishes an’ pans, I was so outdone\r\nthinkin’ ’bout de folks at home. Den de captain pass me an’ say: ‘Look\r\nheer, what you snifflin’ ’bout? Did you know dis young man?’\r\n\r\n“An’ when I told ’im yesser, dat captain got mighty serious in de face\r\nan’ yell out to de rest um, ‘Why didn’t you-all had dis man testify?’\r\n\r\n“But nobody wouldn’t answer. Den de captain set down nigh me an’ I could\r\nsee his hands was tremblin’ powerful. He talked low like he was sorter\r\nashamed. An’ he ax me: ‘Who is de young man? Whar do he live?’\r\n\r\n“I told ’im Marse Eddie was my young Marster an’ at he was s’rounded in\r\nde mountains when he was tryin’ to git home on his furlough, wid his so’\r\narm, an’ sick an’ hungry.\r\n\r\n“Well, suh, I hain’t never had too much use fur Yankees, but dat one’s\r\nface cert’ney did look troubled.\r\n\r\n“‘Gawd furgive us,’ he say, dat’s what he said, ‘and we-all thought he\r\nwas lyin’ to git free;’ an’ he most stagger as he walked off. Den I heer\r\n’im order um not to bury Marse Eddie yit but to wait. Dey fixed ’im as\r\nnice as dey kin on a litter an’ put a new gray blanket on ’im an’ send\r\n’im off to we-all’s place, kase I reckon dey lowed dey had done all de\r\ndamage dey kin an’ thought it would be a kindness to old Miss to bury ’er\r\nown child.\r\n\r\n“After dey done gone, I heer de captain say: ‘Dis is a mistaken duty. I’d\r\nruther myse’f lie on dat litter. Heaven is gwine to curse dis bloodshed,\r\nLieutenant,’ he say to a spry young man. ‘Lieutenant, you know’ what\r\nwe-all shot dat po’ boy fur? We shot ’im kase he come home wounded to\r\nsee his fair-faced sister back on dat plantation, an’ his old bedridden\r\nmother. Lieutenant, let dat be a lesson to you. Dat letter in his pocket\r\nwasn’t no spy-letter. It was des to his pa back in de army of de Souf\r\ntellin’ ’im he was nigh his home. When he writ he was tryin’ to git thoo\r\nde lines it wasn’t to spy. Yo’ maw’s a-livin’, ain’t she, Lieutenant?’ De\r\nyoung man nodded his haid, an’ den de captain went on agi’n: ‘Well, des\r\nput yo’se’f in dis young man’s place an’ den you gwine see how yo’ maw ud\r\nfeel to had you sent home dat away.’\r\n\r\n“Wid all de ’sturbance, it seemed like dey done furget dat I ort to be at\r\nhome wid my white folks at sech a’ awful time, an’ dey kep’ me till long\r\natter dinner. Den who shall come right in de camp ’cep’ young Miss? I\r\nnever in all my days seed sech a look as was in her face. Seemed like she\r\nwas in ’er sleep, ur out’n ’er mind, ur suppin another. It looked like\r\nall de officers in de camp wanted to hide out, but de captain was man\r\nenough to face ’er an’ went right up to whar she was.\r\n\r\n“‘I come to see de spot whar de young Confederate died dis mawnin’, if\r\nyou please,’ she said, as cool as I ever seed young Miss in my life,\r\ndough ’er eyes was flashin’ like diamonds in de sun.\r\n\r\n“‘Young lady,’ de captain say, mighty white in de face, ‘dis is a po’\r\ntime to ’spress regrets, but Gawd knows dis is a gre’t mistake. I’d\r\nruther be daid myse’f. I pray Gawd to furgive us. We acted too quick. De\r\nevidence showed dat yo’ brother was a spy, an’ we never knowed no better\r\ntill it was all over.’\r\n\r\n“‘I did not come to discuss his death,’ young Miss said mighty haughty.\r\n‘I des want to see de spot whar he fell. We-all is grateful fer his\r\nremains—sometimes it ain’t done, I believe.’\r\n\r\n“‘Young Miss,’ I said to ’er, ‘come, le’s go back home; dey will let me\r\ngo wid you.’\r\n\r\n“Den she looked at me fur de fus time. ‘Was you heer, Ham?’ she say; ‘den\r\nyou’ll do; you kin show me ’dout troublin’ dese gentlemen. Show me whar\r\nmy brurr fell, an’ den I’ll go back to mother. I was des afraid de army\r\nwould march off an’ I never would know de exact spot whar de outrage\r\nhappened.’\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  “When she passed ’im she tuck out a copper piece an’ drap it in his hat.”\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Den I led ’er to’des de sweetgum an’ p’int it out. She des took one look\r\nat it, an’ den she put ’er han’ over ’er face an’ said in a awful low\r\nvoice: ‘Le’s go quick, Ham,’ an’ I knowed she was afeerd she’d break down\r\n’fo’ dem low-lived soldiers, an’ dat she’d druther be daid ’an to do it.\r\nAll de way home she ain’t open ’er lips.\r\n\r\n“Well, to close my tale, when old Marster come home after de war was over\r\nol’ Miss was daid. It seems a long time ago. Young Miss an’ ’er pa went\r\nto Richmond to live, whar he had a lill property dat ’scaped de Yankee’s\r\nhands. She turned out to be a gre’t lady an’ had big men—governors an’\r\ncongressmen runnin’ atter her to git ’er to marry um. De funniest thing\r\nof all was de way dat Yankee captain did after de war was over; I heer\r\nsome o’ my white folks say he writ two dozen letters to young Miss. He\r\ntold ’er in um dat she was the onliest woman he ever laid eyes on dat\r\ncompletely tuck his heart and he say ’twas all kase she had so much pride\r\nand fine sperit. He begged ’er to let by-gones be by-gones an’ let ’im\r\ncome down to Richmond an’ ’splain, but she didn’t so much as answer de\r\nletters an’ got so she sent um back to ’im dout openin’ um. Dey say he\r\nmanaged to meet ’er at a big dinner somebody give up in Richmond an’\r\nwas introduced to ’er. Of co’se, young Miss was too much of a lady to\r\n’suit ’im when dey bofe visitin’ de same house, so she bowed to ’im an’\r\n’changed a few words, but she left de house an’ called her carriage.\r\nDat’s what my white folks done tole me; I dunno, but it cert’ney was like\r\nyoung Miss. Dey say dat treatment didn’t faze dat captain, he was so\r\ndead bent on gittin’ ’er fur his wife; so one day, some time atter dat,\r\nhe follered ’er to a big chu’ch in Richmond, whar she went to worship.\r\nDey say it had high steps to it, an’ when she come out’n de do’ she seed\r\n’im at de foot o’ de steps waitin’ fur ’er, wid his hat helt out in his\r\nhand. Well, suh, what you reckon young Miss did? She had her purse in ’er\r\nhand wid some small change in it, an’ when she passed ’im she tuck out\r\na copper piece an’ drap it in his hat widout so much as lookin’ at ’im,\r\ndes as ef he was a begger. Dey say dat settled ’im. He went off an’ never\r\nbothered ’er again.\r\n\r\n“Did she marry? Yes, suh, she did, fer she had pickin’ choice o’ de whole\r\ncountry, Norf an’ Souf. She married a big rich man in Richmond, an’ she’s\r\ngot some o’ de likeliest childern in de world. Her pa is dar doin’ well,\r\ntoo; dey send me money every now an’ den an’ wish me well. Dey is folks\r\nright, suh, an’ ef you ever run across um you’ll know I’m tellin’ you de\r\ntrufe.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  SONG.\r\n\r\n                           BY ROBERT LOVEMAN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      Drenched in the dew of tender tears,\r\n                        A song doth blossom in my heart;\r\n                      The trembling words are fraught with fears,\r\n                        The melody is love’s sweet art.\r\n\r\n                      O, to my lady, song, away!\r\n                        Be thou my courier, true and fleet,\r\n                      Mesh her in music all the day,\r\n                        Then die in fragrance at her feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    THE PEOPLE OF THE SOUTHERN MILLS.\r\n\r\n           A HOPEFUL SIDE TO LIFE IN THE FACTORY COMMUNITIES.\r\n\r\n                         By Leonora Beck Ellis.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the political economist knits his brows in perplexity over the\r\nimmoderate increase of cotton mills in the Southern States, and the\r\nsocial reformer cries vehemently against their child labor and low adult\r\nwages, these problems are solving themselves by natural processes which\r\nman’s economics or sociological theories can neither hurry nor retard.\r\n\r\nCotton manufacturing has traversed the road to its base of supply,\r\nand can no more be severed from it again than the descending rivulet\r\ncan turn and run up hill. Child labor is only a complicated error of\r\nnew conditions, and will in due process fall to inevitable decay. The\r\nwage problem mutates everywhere, yet optimism assures us that it bears\r\nsteadily towards solution.\r\n\r\nBut the mill people of the South are a new and picturesque labor class.\r\nSome glimpses of their homes and family life will, we believe, afford\r\ninterest to the reader for entertainment as well as to the student of\r\nsociology.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are points of distinct difference between the factory operatives of\r\nthe South and those of any other section of our country or of Europe.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there are no urban instincts in these Southern mill\r\ncommunities. Whatever virtues they lack at least they have not the vices\r\nof cities. The good and the evil in them are still such as belong to a\r\nstrictly rural people. But no one must expect, after another decade and a\r\nhalf, to find the same thing true; for, with the passing of the present\r\ngeneration, this unique characteristic must of necessity be largely lost.\r\nGregariousness of living is potent to efface such a mark even when\r\ndeeply stamped.\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, What are the indications of this quality which, for\r\nwant of a better name, is termed rusticity? The signs are many and easy\r\nto read. No observant person can miss the plain evidence even in his\r\nfirst day with the mill people. He walks past the cottages, row on row,\r\nand sees prince’s feather and bachelor’s button growing in the tiny\r\nyards, patchwork quilts sunning from the windows, and strings of red\r\npepper festooned on the back porches. The boys are quite often chewing\r\ntobacco, but they are not smoking cigarettes. Often, alas! the girls dip\r\nsnuff, but they do not lace in their waists, nor attempt handkerchief\r\nflirtations. The women are given to quiet, and a profound reserve\r\nusually marks their social intercourse. The festive gatherings in the\r\nentertainment halls on Saturday nights are either stiff parties or\r\ngenuine country dances. The “barbecue” is common on a general holiday and\r\nthe “all day singing” of a Sunday still remains the acme of enjoyment,\r\naffording the perfect blending of sociality and devotion.\r\n\r\nA second quality differentiating our people from the Northern factory\r\ncommunities of to-day, is what may well be called their unmodified\r\nAmericanism. Up to the present time there is an entire absence of the\r\nforeign element of population among them, and the effect of such absence\r\nis very marked. Not only do better manners prevail in this people sprung\r\nfrom our own soil, but better morals, greater social purity, less\r\nturbulence and lawlessness. Remember, that observance of law is easier,\r\nmore natural, even to illiterate Americans, than to other nations,\r\nbecause Law has typified to them from childhood the majesty of right, not\r\nthe tyranny of might.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MILLS 1, 2 AND 3, PELZER, S. C.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe finer respect for women which marks American manhood, extends also to\r\nthese toilers. Except among their very lowest, motherhood inspires the\r\nregard it meets with in other social strata. And while in many of the\r\nmills the number of female employees exceeds that of males, yet in few of\r\nthe better kind are there any mothers of young children at work.\r\n\r\nThese considerations lead at once to the questions, Where does such a\r\nclass of labor come from? What are its antecedents?\r\n\r\nThe first is easily answered: The operatives have poured into the new\r\nfactories, not from town or city, but from the country, direct from\r\nthe cotton fields, we may say, to the mills. It was certainly not an\r\nanomalous movement when cotton was bringing 4¾ cents per pound. But\r\nas the staple moves back to its old prices, 10 and 12 cents, some\r\nreactionary phases must be looked for and provided against.\r\n\r\nThe antecedents of this class of labor deserve attention. A great\r\nmajority of the operatives come from the agricultural class known as\r\ntenant farmers; that is, men who farm the land for others, paying as rent\r\na considerable portion of each year’s crop. The tenant system was adopted\r\nin the South during the period of disorder and chaotic ruin following the\r\nCivil War, when our old system of labor was dissolved and no better base\r\nremained on which to build anew the fabric of agricultural life. Unfit\r\nas it is for a country of such institutions as ours, and the source in\r\nitself of very sore evils, the tenant system still had a necessary part\r\nin the last half century.\r\n\r\nMany of the tenant farmers of the last generation had indeed “seen\r\nbetter days.” Not a few had been freeholders before the war, although\r\nusually of the little farms interspersed here and there among the great\r\nplantations of the aristocrats. Many others had been overseers, factors,\r\nagents of various sorts. A very small proportion came from the class of\r\ndecayed gentlemen. The rest were made up from those strata usually lumped\r\ntogether in our designation, “crackers,” or, in the South Carolina term,\r\n“poor Buckra.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HOMES FROM WHICH THE MILL PEOPLE COME.\r\n]\r\n\r\nSuch are the antecedents of the mass of operatives in the new mills\r\nof the South. Bearing in mind this derivation, you will not find it\r\ndifficult to account for many qualities, traits and habitudes that\r\nmight otherwise appear anomalous. For example, their extravagance is a\r\ncharacteristic almost without parallel among other classes of toilers.\r\nBut it is simple of explanation.\r\n\r\nThe transition from a dollarless past to a many-dollared present would\r\nrender any class of untutored human beings extravagant. Through a long\r\nperiod of tenant farming, these people scarcely saw a piece of money\r\nfrom Christmas to Christmas. Each year’s supplies were either furnished\r\nby the owner of the land, or bought on credit at a nearby store, to\r\nbe paid for when the cotton was picked. The harvest came, sometimes\r\ngood, sometimes bad; but good or bad, it seemed uniformly to take it\r\nall to pay the merchant and the landlord. The tenant rarely enjoyed\r\neven the sorry pleasure of selling his cotton and paying the hard cash\r\nto these creditors; instead, he usually hauled the raw product of his\r\ntoil directly to them, then turned apathetically away to begin his\r\nhalf-hearted preparations for another year’s crop. His wife and children\r\nshared his labors, sharing also his empty-handedness.\r\n\r\nThis went on through the dragging years of the South’s agricultural\r\nprostration, until the last decade came, with its mills and its\r\nindustrial revolution, when the moneyless and landless ones drew into\r\nthe new communities, to try bread-winning under unfamiliar conditions.\r\nThe mothers and daughters had often worked on the farms, so they did not\r\nhesitate at the factory door, except when very young children claimed the\r\ncare of the former. In most instances, indeed, the women’s fingers proved\r\nthe readiest for the new occupation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE MOUNTAIN TOP CABIN\r\n]\r\n\r\nBut neither women nor men acquired dexterity without a period of\r\nlaborious effort, such as all workmen must struggle through when,\r\npossessed of only the inherited instincts of generations of bucolic\r\nancestors, they set themselves to some form of mechanical labor. That\r\nperiod being done with, a certain amount of skill began to appear in all\r\nfairly intelligent operatives, and shortly they found themselves bringing\r\nhome each Saturday night, or alternate Saturday night, according as pay\r\nday fell, an amount of money that to them seemed an amazing treasure-pile.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A TYPICAL MILL COTTAGE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nCases such as the following are found in every prosperous factory\r\ncommunity: The father, mother, and six or eight boys and girls, ranging\r\nfrom twelve to twenty odd years, are at work in one mill. Large families\r\nare the rule in this class, remember. Now, the adults, if fair weavers,\r\neasily average $22.99 apiece per month. The younger members of the family\r\nare probably spinners, and average about $14 each. This family, then,\r\nthat in the old life of the farm thought themselves fortunate indeed to\r\nhandle $100 in cash throughout a year, now bring home something like\r\n$175 every month!\r\n\r\nIs it strange to you that extravagance seizes upon this metamorphosed\r\nhousehold? If the sudden transition from pennilessness to plethoric\r\npocket-books did not lead in itself straight to spendthrift living, the\r\nprecedents of their neighbors would speedily teach the trait.\r\n\r\nSo the housewife loads the table with luxuries hitherto unknown; the\r\npretty girl is tempted into all the caprices of dress that her little\r\nVanity Fair may flaunt, while the father and brother can scarcely tell\r\nwhither their dollars speed on such swift wings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE LYCEUM, PELZER, S. C.\r\n]\r\n\r\nYet this wastefulness, too, is but a phase, destined to gradual\r\nelimination in the development of the process by which an agricultural\r\npeople are converted into a manufacturing one. With all their illiteracy\r\nthis class is not devoid of understanding; and when a certain\r\nbewilderment of these early years is past, it will be borne in upon them\r\nin countless ways, by their school privileges, their larger experience,\r\ntheir clearer views of the outside world, by their own innate manhood,\r\nindeed, that there are far other uses for hard-earned money than to be\r\nlavished on mere food, clothing and shelter. Many of them are already\r\nopening their eyes to the fact that for an abundance of things to eat\r\nand wear, they have bartered a certain independence and manliness which\r\nare fostered by agricultural pursuits, even the lowliest, and which\r\nbreed sturdier virtues than mere factory dependents can hope to transmit\r\nto their children. Awakening perceptions such as these are leading to\r\ndifferent results: to a rescinding of extravagance always; sometimes\r\na return to the farm; occasionally to the laying aside of money or\r\ninvesting it in a home just outside the factory property. But in most\r\ncases I find a steadfast purpose growing,—to work straight on where they\r\nare for the present, and save every cent possible to educate the coming\r\ngeneration and set their feet in the path that leads to freedom. I have\r\neven found several young men and women putting aside money to go to\r\nschool on when enough is saved, and many go to school and work through\r\nalternate half years.\r\n\r\nBut how can they save money? clamor those who have been studying the\r\ncomparative wage-scale of Northern and Southern factories, without\r\nacquaintance with the actual conditions of the latter. By reasonable\r\neconomy, is the answer in this case as others.\r\n\r\nFrom $20 to $30 per month is paid good weavers throughout this section,\r\nwhile the average spinner draws from $10 to $16. These are regarded as\r\ngood living wages in a country where the prices of necessaries range much\r\nlower than in the East or the West. Houses are to be heated only about\r\nfour months in the year, and fuel is comparatively cheap, in many places\r\nless than $1.50 per cord for wood, while coal averages less than half the\r\nprice it brings in Northern markets. Clothing in this warm climate costs\r\nfar less than in a colder region. Farm and garden supplies are purchased\r\nfor what seems to the Northern mind an absurdly low price, and dairy\r\nproducts are never high. Besides, in all the rural mill communities,\r\nwhich are now counted by the score to every one in a city, a garden patch\r\nalways and often pasturage for one cow can be counted on with every\r\ncottage.\r\n\r\nHouse rent is not a considerable item. The mill cottages rent by the\r\nmonth on the basis of 60 cents to $1 per room, and the houses range in\r\nsize from three to eight rooms, four, however, being the rule. With few\r\nexceptions, these cottages are fairly comfortable, and built with due\r\nregard to sanitation. Outside of cities, each one has its ground space\r\nwhere the inmates may grow flowers and vegetables, thus fostering a form\r\nof local attachment that is by no means weak.\r\n\r\nFrom this brief survey, it may be deduced that while the one-time tiller\r\nof the soil has surrendered something in becoming a factory operative,\r\nhe has also come into new privileges and potentialities. When you\r\nstrike your balance between gain and loss, do not overlook the weighty\r\nconsideration of the school advantages and other educational facilities\r\nwhich such people have acquired by coming from sparse and remote\r\nsettlements into their present community life.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring a recent cold snap the young and tender editor of this youthful\r\npublication accompanied the blizzard to a small Tennessee town. The\r\noffice of the little hotel was full of commercial travelers trying to\r\nkeep warm around a single grate. A half-frozen Italian organ grinder,\r\nwith his monkey, entered, but was crowded away from the fire by the\r\ntraveling men. He found a chair away back in the corner of the room and\r\nsoon fell asleep. But suddenly he woke with a scream; the traveling men\r\nrushed to him and asked him what was the matter. He said he dreamed he\r\nwas in hell and was freezing to death. “Freezing to death in hell! How is\r\nthat?” asked one of the boys. “Well,” replied the Italian, “the drummers\r\ncrowded around the fire so I couldn’t get to it.”—_Robert. L. Taylor._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE MERRY LADY.\r\n\r\n            By Roger Pocock, Author of “A Frontiersman,” etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   I.\r\n\r\nThe poplar groves were gemmed with diamond frost, and they stood in a\r\nfairy circle surrounding a glade of snow. Beyond lay all the immensity\r\nof the Canadian Plains, above rode the sun in a heaven of cloudless\r\nblue, but within the glade there was war. Jets of sharp flame flickered\r\nfrom all the groves, giving birth to clouds like pearls, which drifted\r\non the serene air and made a bluish film of smoke above the waves of\r\nthe snowdrift. Across the foot of the glade some sleighs were drawn up\r\nfor defence, each giving shelter to a knot of men, though the woodwork\r\nshattered in splinters about their ears. Lying with carbines at rest\r\nunderneath the sleighs, they watched for the smoke pearls in the woods,\r\nthen sighting low to clear the combs of the snowdrifts, they fired\r\nsteadily at hidden enemies. A shower of diamond dust would fall from\r\nsome fairy tree while the marksman swore thoughtfully, and loaded to try\r\nagain. So rifles blazed and crashed, so bullets whined or sang, but all\r\nthis was merely a twittering as of summer birds amid that mighty silence\r\nof the plains, which filled the vault of heaven sun-high with peace.\r\n\r\nYesterday a village of retired buffalo-hunters, French-Indian\r\nhalf-breeds, sorely annoyed with the Canadian government, had set up\r\na toy republic, and persuaded some Indian tribes to come out on the\r\nwarpath. To-day a troop of the Northwest Mounted Police, assisted\r\nby a handful of volunteers, had come out from Fort Carlton to make\r\nenquiries—and been neatly ambushed. The party of the first part numbered\r\nthree hundred and sixty-one and the party of the second part only\r\nninety-six, as witnessed this Disagreement, dated near Duck Lake, in the\r\nDistrict of Saskatchewan, in the Northwest Territory of Canada, this 26th\r\nday of March, 1885.\r\n\r\nThe trooper farthest to the left of the sleigh rampart was a man of giant\r\ngirth and stature, with an ugly face. Officially he was Regimental Number\r\n1107, Constable la Mancha, J., but his pet name was the Blackguard,\r\npresumably because of his manners and customs. When the fighting began\r\nhe had been much alarmed, then displeased because a bullet whipped some\r\nfur from his buffalo overcoat, and in another minute full of cheerful\r\nfury, boiling hot with a frantic appetite for trouble. Moreover, the\r\nvery moment he began pumping lead into the nearest clump of bushes a\r\nnaked Indian was seen to leap into the air, and fall headlong. “My meat!”\r\ncried the Blackguard, and took a ferocious interest in getting more. A\r\nfew minutes later he heard the man next him on the right utter a little\r\ngrunt, and gave his hot carbine a rest while he looked round to see what\r\nwas wrong. A gallant young Canadian, Corporal Buck McCannock, had been\r\nhit, and rolled over on his back beside la Mancha. The Blackguard felt\r\nrather sick, watching the red flush fade beneath the tan while the man’s\r\nstrong features became wan and pinched.\r\n\r\n“Say, Buck, old chap, can I help?” Buck’s eyes were closed, and he did\r\nnot seem to hear. The sunlight glowed on the scarlet serge of his jacket,\r\nthe glittering buttons, the bright accoutrements, as he lay with his\r\nbuffalo coat spread wide upon the snow. Only his face was in shadow.\r\n\r\n“Buck, old man!”\r\n\r\nHis eyes opened, his right hand moved out, his fingers plucking at la\r\nMancha’s sleeve, then very slowly his left hand groped at the breast of\r\nhis jacket, and drew out a paper until it caught between the buttons. La\r\nMancha saw that Buck’s lips were moving now, and bending down he heard a\r\nbroken whisper, “Take this—tell her—tell her—”\r\n\r\nThe clay-white face relaxed, and the Blackguard saw a bluish shadow\r\ncome up like rising water over it, over the glazing eyes. Then the lips\r\nparted. He wrenched the letter from the clutch of a dead hand, which slid\r\naway down the breast of the scarlet jacket, and dropped to the ground.\r\n\r\nIt was the shattering blow of a bullet in the sleigh box above his head\r\nwhich roused la Mancha to turn and fight again. Hitherto he had merely\r\ndisliked those men behind the snowdrifts, but now he wanted to skin, and\r\nburn a few of them slowly, and prayed to the saints that each bullet\r\nshould inflict a painful and mortal wound, followed by a disagreeable\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nThen he heard footsteps in the creaking snow, and knew that the troop\r\nsurgeon had found the corpse beside him. He heard the doctor whisper:\r\n“Buck? Poor Buck!”\r\n\r\nWhen la Mancha looked round again Dr. Miller was gone and a red-haired\r\ntrooper was busy stripping the ammunition from the dead man’s belt.\r\n\r\n“Down, fool,” said the Blackguard; “that scalp of yours draws fire—you\r\nruddy oot.”\r\n\r\nRed lay down on the edge of the dead man’s coat, and threw his feet\r\nacross the Blackguard’s legs lest the snow should wet them. Then he\r\ngrunted with content.\r\n\r\n“Happy?” asked the Blackguard.\r\n\r\n“’Ungry—gimme blood! Look there!”\r\n\r\nRed jerked his thumb backwards over his shoulder and showed his chum\r\nhow one of the officers, Inspector Sarde, lay near them. Sarde was\r\nhiding behind the next sleigh on the left, making an abject display of\r\ncowardice. “The lantern-jawed, swivel-eyed, white-livered, scarehead,\r\nmisbegotten, jumped up son of a dog’s wife,” was the Blackguard’s\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\n“I kicked ’im,” Red grinned in ferocious joy, “cruel ’ard, too.”\r\n\r\n“Red, help me to clear that bluff in front there; sight at one hundred\r\nyards, and fire low.”\r\n\r\n“Low it is.” Red settled himself to work, fired, and pumped a cartridge\r\nwhile he watched results.\r\n\r\n“What makes you sing, eh, Blackguard? I’m in a funk, I am—” he fired\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“Was I singing?” La Mancha let drive at a smoke puff. “I bagged a buck\r\nIndian just now—aim low—got ’im.\r\n\r\n  “Carry him reverently, gently, slow—\r\n    Pace by the trunnions with patient tread;\r\n  Over the drifts of the rolling snow,\r\n    With arms reversed for the Dead.”\r\n\r\n“Nice and cheerful, ain’t yer!” cried Red sarcastically, but la Mancha\r\nenjoyed himself.\r\n\r\n  “Little we thought of him while he shared\r\n    All that was worst in the long campaign;\r\n  Little he guessed that we really cared,\r\n    But drums roll now for the slain.\r\n\r\n  Spreading the Flag o’er his last long sleep,\r\n    Leading the horse which he may not ride.\r\n  Tho’ for the living the roads are steep—\r\n    The road for the Dead rolls wide.”\r\n\r\n“’Ere, stop that!” Red howled at him, then wiped his eyes with his\r\nsleeve, as the Blackguard went on in a broken voice, revelling in grief.\r\n\r\n  “Bravely he suffer’d and manly fought;\r\n    Great with Death’s majesty rides he there;\r\n  Royal the honors he dearly bought—\r\n    The peace which we may not share.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, shut up!” Red wailed, but la Mancha grinned at him. “Blackguard, got\r\nany more ammunition?”\r\n\r\nThe Blackguard chuckled: “For my self? why, plenty!” and he fired at a\r\npearly gust of smoke among fairy trees of diamond. Then he heard the\r\ndeath scream of a horse at the rear, the shouting of orders, and a bugle\r\ncrying, “Cease firing! Retire!”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   II.\r\n\r\nThe horses were bought up from the rear, bucking, fighting, breaking\r\naway, or falling in their traces as the teamsters took them in charge.\r\nThen the enemy charged, the rear guard held them back, and confusion\r\nverged towards panic under a galling fire. La Mancha, with Red for his\r\noff man, was lucky enough to get a team away unharmed, but, as his horses\r\nplunged through breast-high drifts, he heard the outcry of two wounded\r\nmen. Their sleigh, with one horse killed, and the other dying, had been\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\n“All right, Gilchrist!” he called. “Keep your hair on, Smith!” then swung\r\nhis team about—“Drive on!” yelled Inspector Sarde, jumping directly in\r\nhis path.\r\n\r\nFor answer the Blackguard drove straight over him to the rescue. In\r\nanother moment willing helpers had carried the wounded men to la Mancha’s\r\nsleigh, and half a dozen jumped in to defend them, as the teamsters swung\r\naway towards the trail.\r\n\r\nWhen he had tailed in with the retreat he turned, “What became of Sarde\r\nthe Coward?” he called back over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n“In your sleigh, constable!” answered the officer. “Sergeant, put this\r\nman under arrest.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sir,” the sergeant saluted. “Constable la Mancha,” he called, “for\r\ncharging an officer with cowardice in the field, consider yourself under\r\narrest.”\r\n\r\nThe charge was made, and only la Mancha could withdraw that now. Sarde\r\nlooked from face to face and all eyes accused him; all these men were\r\nwitnesses against him on a charge of cowardice in the field. He set his\r\nteeth.\r\n\r\n“Sergeant,” he said, “when we reach the Fort you will put this constable\r\nunder close arrest.”\r\n\r\nThe Blackguard was singing gaily as he drove, singing in vengeful\r\ntriumph, forgetting the dozen or so of his comrades whose bodies lay on\r\nthe bloody snow, abandoned. Then he remembered and was silent, while the\r\ncrackle of musketry dwindled away astern, as the men of the rear guard\r\nfell back. Only the lope of the horses, the creaking of the runners,\r\nand occasional sobbing gasps of a hurt man in the sleigh, disturbed the\r\nsilence of the wilderness. La Mancha handed the reins to his off man:\r\n\r\n“Take the team, Red; I want—”\r\n\r\nHe took a letter from his pocket, and sat, all humped up, reading\r\ngloomily.\r\n\r\nEight miles away the fellows down in the Fort were waiting for news, the\r\nnews of victory. Red’s heart, as he drove, was aching; his face burned\r\nwith shame as he thought of the Outfit thrashed—the Greatest Regiment on\r\nEarth disgraced—the dead left in the field, the sleighs full of wounded\r\nmen in their agony—then the settlements! What could save the far-strung,\r\nlonely settlements now from being sacked and burned, the men tortured to\r\ndeath, the women—the children! He dared not think of them at the mercy\r\nof Red Indian tribes at war. And Buck was dead; poor old Buck, who had\r\nrooked him last night at cribbage—dead!\r\n\r\n“Dearest,” the Blackguard read, “I can’t bear him any longer. Meet me\r\nbehind the stockade at dusk. Your poor Polly.”\r\n\r\nWho the deuce was Polly? What had he to tell her anyway from Buck? He\r\nput away Buck’s letter, and drove on, climbing the hillocks, swishing\r\ndown the hollows among lakes and groves, until the deep valley of the\r\nSaskatchewan opened ahead, and far down beside the river he saw the old\r\nHudson’s Bay Company’s post, Fort Carlton, where the Union Jack flamed\r\nout above the stockade, and the garrison waited for news of victory.\r\n\r\nAway to the right, upon the eastern trail, a string of loaded sleighs was\r\nsweeping down long slopes toward the Fort, covered by mounted men with\r\nall the glitter and pageantry of war—the reinforcement which had come too\r\nlate—B Troop, triumphant after a tremendous forced march to the rescue.\r\nThe Blackguard grunted his disparagement, and spoke to his off man:\r\n\r\n“Who’s poor Polly?”\r\n\r\nRed laughed: “Sarde’s wife, of course.”\r\n\r\nThe Blackguard whistled softly. “So she’s poor Polly—oh, you sly dog! Oh,\r\nBuck!”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III.\r\n\r\nThe Blackguard slept in the cells a prisoner—“Pretty well, thank you!”\r\nas he told Red, through the window, afterwards. All day he lay at ease\r\nwhile the rest of the fellows made dismal lamentations about overwork.\r\nThat soothed him, also the aftertaste of a nice fight, while in his\r\ncheery soul he gloated on things to come, the war, the downfall of Sarde,\r\nand meetings with that officer’s merry lady. No wonder she could not bear\r\nany more Sarde—small blame to her, for he was dismal and the lady gay,\r\nwith a sense of humor, an engaging laugh, a dimple or two, and a pert eye\r\nfor any fun in sight. Poor Polly! And so she let Buck hold her hand of an\r\nevening? Poor Buck! The Blackguard sighed. “But I’m rather nice”—he felt\r\nthat Buck would approve—“and disengaged, too! I’m grateful, refreshing,\r\ncomforting, well broken, docile, with the sweetest manners, the dearest\r\nlittle ways.” He chuckled as he thought of other merry ladies whom he had\r\nfondly loved, two or three at a time, charming girls by swarms down the\r\nperspectives of nice memory. “I did my duty.” He crooned, and composed\r\nhimself for a nap.\r\n\r\nRed came in the afternoon with news. The fort was to be abandoned,\r\nevacuated at midnight, and the garrison was to fall back, defending the\r\nsettlements eastward. The boys had been turned loose to loot the Hudson’s\r\nBay store—and here was the Blackguard’s share, flung in through the bars:\r\na box of cigars, a mouth organ, a fine revolver, a baby’s bottle, some\r\nchocolate creams, and a family Bible which caught him full in the eye and\r\nfloored him.\r\n\r\nThe Blackguard found that he could not play the mouth organ while he was\r\neating chocolates and smoking, but had to take them by turns. The shadow\r\nof night stole softly in through the bars before he was bored.\r\n\r\nLater on he began to get hungry, and as supper was delayed some hours\r\nhe clamored at the door. To his amazement he was at once let out by a\r\nhalf-breed washerwoman, and looking round saw that the guardroom was\r\nfull of civilian refugees. For a minute he stood watching them as they\r\nsat around a glowing stove, whose naked iron flue went red-hot through\r\nthe wooden ceiling. “You’ll have the place on fire soon,” he said, and\r\nthey only smiled at him. Where was the Guard? Away relieving sentries,\r\nhe supposed, as he reached his sidearms down from a peg, belted on his\r\nrevolver, and strolled outside. He found himself in the covered entry\r\nof the fort, under the gate house. On his right the great courtyard was\r\nlittered with sleighs, and swarming with men at work preparing for the\r\nretreat. On his left the gates swung ajar. To look more business-like\r\nhe swung an axe across his shoulder, and marched out, explaining to\r\nthe sentry that he was on duty. The riverside meadows lay silver below\r\nthe moon and the fresh night allured him as he skirted the stockade,\r\nanswering a challenge from the bastion, then turned towards the rear side\r\nof the fort. He was thinking of the merry lady who might have been there\r\nhad he come last night. She was there!\r\n\r\nHe drew near to the cloaked and silent woman, and lifted his cap; “Mrs.\r\nSarde, I think?”\r\n\r\nShe shrank back against the upright posts of the stockade, thrust out\r\nwhite hands against him, and barely repressed a scream. “Who are you?\r\nWhat are you?” she cried.\r\n\r\nHe saw that her face was pale, touched by the moonlight into a spiritual\r\ndelicacy. “The Blackguard, madam,” he answered.\r\n\r\n“Oh, how you frightened me! What is it, la Mancha? You’ve brought a\r\nmessage for me?”\r\n\r\n“You thought I was a ghost,” he whispered; “you thought I was—”\r\n\r\n“Buck? Yes.” He saw a tear run down her cheek. “Yes, I thought so.”\r\n\r\n“I am his messenger.” The Blackguard’s voice was soft and low, he leaned\r\ntowards her, his hand against the stockade, as he bent down. “His last\r\nthought was of you, he tried to give me a message, but his voice failed\r\nthen.”\r\n\r\n“My brother! My poor brother!” The Blackguard started back.\r\n\r\n“The deuce!” he stammered, “what a beastly sell! Your brother, madam?”\r\nHe uncovered his head. “I beg your pardon, Mrs. Sarde; I beg your\r\nforgiveness.”\r\n\r\n“Nobody knew,” her voice was broken with tears; “not even my husband.\r\nPoor boy—things had gone wrong down East. He had to change his name, and\r\nwhen he joined the Force—for my sake, he wouldn’t say that he was my\r\nbrother. He was in the ranks, you see, and I—”\r\n\r\n“You are in trouble, madam”—a new reverence had come into la Mancha’s\r\nmanner. “I was your brother’s friend—may I take his place and serve you?”\r\n\r\n“How kind of you to think of that, Mr. la Mancha. But then, you see, my\r\nhusband—you understand?”\r\n\r\n“Has the right to protect you; yes, he has that great honor.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don’t mind me!” came Sarde’s sarcastic interruption, and both of\r\nthem turned round, startled, horrified, to face the officer of the guard,\r\nvisiting round unattended. “You may well start—the pair of you,” said\r\nInspector Sarde, his eyes glittering with rage, then with bitter sarcasm\r\nhe went on; “A husband’s rights? Moonshine! Myths! Lies! Woman, get back\r\nto the fort at once, or I’ll have you arrested for being out of bounds.”\r\n\r\n“But, Cuthbert,” she pleaded, “you don’t understand. This gentleman—”\r\n\r\n“Go, I say; go! Leave me to settle with this—this gentleman!”\r\n\r\nPoor Polly crept away, and the two men watched her in silence until she\r\nhad turned the corner of the stockade.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” the Blackguard laid his axe against the wall. “At last!”\r\n\r\n“And now, mister gentleman, may I venture to ask what you’re doing\r\noutside your cell?”\r\n\r\n“You may.”\r\n\r\n“Stand to attention; call me ‘sir’ when you address an officer.”\r\n\r\n“Dear, dear! I would shout, I would screech if I were you. Then everybody\r\nwill hear.”\r\n\r\n“The Commissioner shall hear.”\r\n\r\n“What? That I’m here to defend your wife’s honor, which you have\r\ninsulted, you—you poached cat!”\r\n\r\n“Right about turn, quick march for the guard room, or—”\r\n\r\n“Or what?”\r\n\r\nThe officer was silent.\r\n\r\n“That’s right. Now be good. I want to point out,” said the Blackguard\r\nwith yearning sweetness, “that although I am tempted, without witnesses,\r\nI have not kicked you. No. I have denied myself even calling you names,\r\nyou—you mule-foaled outrage on nature’s modesty; you stridulating,\r\nsplay-footed, pop-eyed mistake of Providence; you supercilious\r\nbrass-mounted, misdirected Excuse. I will not shock myself by speaking\r\nthe truth about your appearance, origin, or destiny as a spatchcocked and\r\nfried Sin, but I daresay you’ll understand this—”\r\n\r\nHe flicked his glove across the officer’s face, and stood back, smiling\r\nblandly.\r\n\r\n“How dare you!”\r\n\r\n“With my glove, so—” he struck again, lightly, gracefully, tigerishly.\r\n“You see there are the snipers in the hills, taking the pot-shot, eh?\r\nwhich will explain your death, without my inconvenience; eh? It will\r\naccount for all—we have revolvers—and so! Carramba! What more does the\r\nfool want?”\r\n\r\n“Sir! I’m an officer, a gent—”\r\n\r\n“Exactly—gent. Something less than a gentleman, eh? Well, I waive that. I\r\nwaive the matter of rank—I accommodate you with every kindness; eh, what?”\r\n\r\nSarde hesitated.\r\n\r\n“Come, I know you’re a coward, but never mind that. Brace up! You shall\r\nbe a man for once. There now; at fifteen paces, eh? No? Don’t disappoint\r\nme, please,” the Blackguard pleaded. “I spoil for it—I beg you—have you\r\nno inside? Are you a shadow in trousers? Nombre de Dios! It’s for your\r\nwife’s honor!”\r\n\r\n“I tell you that officers can’t fight with—”\r\n\r\n“With me, Senor? I waive that, I tell you—I, Jose Santa Maria Sebastian\r\nSant Iago Nuñez Ramiro de Guzman, de la Mancha, Marques de las\r\nAlpuxarras, Conde del Pulgar, a peer of Castile, am ready to waive my\r\nrank and fight a scrambled skunk! Draw! Stand back! At the word three I\r\nfire—one—two—Sangre de Cristo!”\r\n\r\nSarde had fired.\r\n\r\n“What the deuce do you mean by firing before I give the word, eh? I’ll\r\npunch your head for that!” The Blackguard clutched at a burning pain on\r\nhis shoulder, his hand was dyed with the blood of a spurting artery—and\r\nyet this seemed to concern him less than the red glare from within the\r\nfort which had flushed the face of his adversary. He reeled backwards\r\nnow, staring up at the stockade, whose timbers loomed black against a\r\nfiery glow, which was rapidly mounting to heaven above Fort Carlton.\r\n\r\n“Sarde,” said la Mancha, gravely, “you see that?”\r\n\r\n“Had enough?” asked Sarde; “I’m going to kill you now. I fire when I\r\ncount three—one—two—defend yourself—”\r\n\r\n“Presently, my good man, presently,” la Mancha waved his hand to Sarde.\r\n“Don’t you see that the fort is on fire?”\r\n\r\n“On fire—what? On fire! By the living—”\r\n\r\n“Hush, don’t gabble, Sarde. You’ve played the man at last; I forgive you\r\nfor firing too soon—I let you off the charge of cowardice in the field.\r\nOh, you needn’t thank me—it’s for your wife’s sake. Yes, I let you off—I\r\nask your pardon, sir. Oh, yes, why not?”\r\n\r\nWithin the fort a bugle was crying the terrible monotonous repetitions\r\nof the General Assembly, and men were yelling, as they ran, of wounded\r\npatients shut up in the blazing house. “The fort’s on fire. The fort’s on\r\nfire,” Sarde moaned.\r\n\r\nLa Mancha clutched Sarde’s arm to steady himself as he reeled backwards\r\nfaint with pain from his wound.\r\n\r\n“Those refugees,” he explained; “half-breeds in the guard room with a red\r\nhot stove. I warned them. Look, the gate house is on fire, the gate is\r\nblocked with flames, the only gate, and the fire will spread all round\r\nthe buildings! All those people going to be burned to death unless we can\r\ncut a road through the stockade—you’ve hit my shoulder—I can’t use the\r\naxe. But you”—he shook the officer with frantic violence—“a Canadian, a\r\nborn axeman— Do you hear? Save the garrison or they’ll burn to death!\r\nTake that axe!”\r\n\r\nThe Canadian sprang forward, the axe became a live thing in his hands;\r\nthe gleaming blade flamed in red air, buried itself in quivering timber,\r\nthen swung again, and lit, and swung again in a whirl of splinters.\r\n\r\nLa Mancha sat down in the snow, his blood-drenched hand upon the wound,\r\nhis body rocking to the steady swing of the axe, though he could hardly\r\nsee his enemy now, because of the red smoke curling between the timbers.\r\n\r\n“Good man!” he gasped, “you are a man at last! You’ll save the garrison,\r\nyou’ll get promoted, you’ll win back that lady’s love-you’re winning back\r\nyour honor! Strike, man—strike!”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt is well known to the two hundred thousand readers of this magazine\r\nthat its bald-headed editor often pulls his hair on the platform.

The drummer looked at the valise and then at\r\nthe bald-headed man and bluntly asked, “Are you a traveling man, sir?”\r\n“Yes, sir,” was the reply. “What line of goods are you selling?” queried\r\nthe drummer. “Sweetened wind,” was the answer. “Oh, you are!” said the\r\ndrummer; “preacher or lecturer?”—_Robert L. Taylor._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           A ROYAL RESIDENCE.\r\n\r\n                        By James Henry Stevenson.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning the Professor, whom I had not seen since I left Tennessee,\r\naccidentally unearthed me in London and proposed that we should visit\r\nWindsor. Now, I may as well confess to defective initiative, in regard to\r\nsight-seeing, for I had been within reach of Windsor on several former\r\noccasions and had not yet seen the home of the most gracious queen the\r\nworld has ever known. This, too, in face of the fact that a German\r\nprofessor had assured me that Windsor was “himmlisch.” When a German so\r\nfar forgets himself as to say that anything English is “heavenly,” be\r\nassured he has great provocation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WINDSOR CASTLE FROM THE THAMES.\r\n]\r\n\r\nOf course, I acceded without hesitation to the Professor’s proposal and\r\nwe selected a train, appointed a _rendezvous_, and agreed to go the\r\nfollowing morning.\r\n\r\nThe Professor’s traveling companion was a “blue grass” doctor of\r\ndivinity, while I was courier, guide, and advance agent to the\r\n“delegate,” sent by his admiring countrymen and brethren to unload some\r\necclesiastical “thunder and lightning” on their conservative confrères\r\nin the old land. The “delegate’s” wife was traveling with him as a sort\r\nof balance wheel on his too impetuous energy and to see that he was not\r\nimposed on by the overbearing foreigner; she was not averse to a little\r\nvigorous sight-seeing when otherwise unemployed. They also joined the\r\nparty, which was completed by “Wee McGregor,” as the eight-year-old was\r\ncalled, who looked to me for his traveling expenses.\r\n\r\nHaving visited London before, and being possessed of an unearned\r\nreputation as a _dragoman_, I felt it was incumbent on me to show the\r\nparty the best and quickest way to reach Windsor. Accordingly I hailed\r\none of those obsolete conveyances which the London City Fathers provide\r\nfor the traveler, to whom the conservation of energy is of more moment\r\nthan arriving at a destination.\r\n\r\nIn due time, somewhat shaken but still in good humor, for the day was\r\nyet young, we arrived at King’s Cross station on the Metropolitan\r\nRailway, better known by the more modest and suggestive title of the\r\n“Underground.” “Here,” I had said to the prospective sightseers, “we\r\nshall get a train that will connect direct and without change at\r\nPaddington station with the train for Windsor.” This was all true except\r\nthe “without change” clause. For this slight deviation from strict\r\nveracity I have no apology to make. Indeed, I doubt whether I am entitled\r\nto play the role of guide while so generous with the truth.\r\n\r\nI kept my tourists “rounded up” and prevented them from embarking in\r\nvarious directions. As there were trains passing every two or three\r\nminutes it seemed a waste of time not to take one and I had, as a\r\nconsequence, a very busy quarter of an hour. At last our train came, and,\r\nafter rushing madly up and down the platform the entire length of the\r\ntrain, we found places, though in different “stalls.”\r\n\r\nWhen an American train arrives at a station you go in and find a seat.\r\nWhen an English train, especially of the old style which is now happily\r\ndisappearing, arrives, you must first find a seat and then go in. You\r\ntrail up and down the platform and poke your nose into every compartment\r\nanswering to the class for which you have purchased tickets. Here is one\r\nwith two or three places vacant, but you have a party of four, and as\r\nthey are strangers in the country, you must keep them together to ensure\r\ntheir alighting at the right place. Besides you naturally want to be\r\nwithin speaking distance of one another. So you start back again to the\r\nother end of the train, terrified every moment lest the engineer grow\r\nweary of your bootless explorations, and decide to start. Ah! Here is a\r\nvacant apartment at last, but just as you are about to step in with a\r\nlight heart you notice that it is marked “first class” and unfortunately\r\nyou are not a millionaire. You continue your search and find eventually\r\na vacant apartment of the class in which you are entitled to ride. Your\r\ntroubles are now ended; your party is seated; your _impedimenta_ are\r\nlaboriously stowed away in the racks, when, with envious nonchalance,\r\nenters a smoker armed with a little cigarette that vomits smoke like\r\na factory chimney. The ladies are indignant; you rack your brain for\r\nsomething sufficiently withering to say, and just as you are ready to\r\ndeliver, you notice, faintly etched on the window, the word “smoking.”\r\nNow, if you were traveling in Austria, you would give the “guard” a\r\nquarter to remove the label with the offensive word, and would settle\r\nback virtuously into the leather cushions, but here, while the English\r\nguard would be equally obliging—for a like “bakshish”—it is a more\r\nserious matter to remove the door or window. In the meantime you have\r\nleft the smoker in quiet possession to fill the vacant space with clouds\r\nof the fragrant weed. In despair you apply to the guard and when you\r\nappropriately recognize his importance, he finds you a place in a moment.\r\n\r\nThe stations on the “Underground” are open to the surface and are light\r\nand airy, but when the train plunges under London, and the compartment\r\nfills up with the gases, that have been accumulating down here for the\r\npast thirty years, you realize that traveling on the “Underground” does\r\nnot differ widely from suicide by slow asphyxiation.\r\n\r\nThe “delegate” put his silk handkerchief to his nostrils and looked\r\nsuspiciously at me. It requires some ten minutes to make the distance\r\nbetween King’s Cross and Paddington, so he was unable to hold his breath\r\nall the way. Every time he breathed I felt as if I had murdered a man.\r\nMy Tennessee friend and the Kentucky parson were not yet disposed to\r\nbe critical, so they chatted merrily, breathed regularly, and acted as\r\nthough these sulphur laden fumes were their “native air.”\r\n\r\nBut after we had quitted Paddington station, and the train had taken its\r\nlast few plunges under ground; when we had actually shaken off the dust\r\nand grime and roar of London, the beauty of the incomparable English\r\nlandscape began to make us glad. Patchwork hillsides, where tiny fields\r\nare partitioned off by greenest hedges, lovely valleys, where brimming\r\nstreams shimmer their length along, came, one by one, into view. The\r\nEnglish streams have no visible banks. The turf, green as an emerald,\r\ngrows clear to the water’s brink and dangles its luxuriant growth into\r\nthe quiet brook, as a barefoot boy, playing truant, cools his feet\r\nin some wayside stream, while the master’s wrath grows warm. These\r\nrivers—for rivers I must call them, though a good athlete might almost\r\nleap from side to side—are always full and seem as though the accidental\r\ndropping in of a pebble would make them overflow.\r\n\r\nAs hill and valley, hedge and garden, country home and quiet hamlet,\r\nall of surpassing loveliness, swept past us, my entire party began to\r\nfall under the spell of this exquisite beauty, and I felt that there had\r\narisen the unanimous, though unexpressed, conviction that now, at last,\r\nthe self-appointed guide was earning his salary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WINDSOR CASTLE FROM THE THAMES.\r\n]\r\n\r\nAs Windsor is distant from London by about forty minutes ride, the\r\ntourist arrives at his destination fresh and “fit,” to use an expressive\r\nEnglish phrase. When we issued forth from the station we encountered, as\r\na matter of course, the ubiquitous hackman who, in all lands, stands ever\r\nready to drive you to all the places you especially do not want to visit.\r\nThe object of our pilgrimage was the Castle, distant a stone’s throw\r\nfrom the station, so there was no occasion to provoke an unnecessary and\r\nfutile dispute with the “cabbie.” We next encountered an army of small\r\nboys distributing handbills, on which were set forth, in eloquent terms,\r\nthe merits of the various “tea rooms” of the city, which unselfishly\r\ncater to the comfort of the stranger. We accepted this service as a\r\nmatter of course, first, because it was gratuitous; second, because it\r\nwas the easiest way to get rid of the boy, and third, because, though a\r\nsight-seer may pull through the day without the assistance of a hansom\r\nor a “growler,” I have never known one who was not ready to take a\r\nlittle refreshment, especially when he was traveling abroad. After we\r\nhad become thoroughly tired out, with climbing the steps of the Round\r\nTower and general sight-seeing, we found a cosy, clean and restful upper\r\nroom, where the actual bill of fare was not badly out of harmony with the\r\npromises of the card.\r\n\r\nThe town of Windsor, itself, possesses nothing of special interest to the\r\ntraveler. The Castle, situated in a commanding position on the Thames,\r\ndominates the town from every point of view, and is, with its environs,\r\nthe sole reason for a visit.\r\n\r\nThe group of buildings enclosed by the walls is nearly a mile in\r\ncircumference and has been the favorite home of most of the sovereigns of\r\nEngland since the days of William the Conqueror. Each one has continued\r\nthe lavish expenditures of his predecessor to enrich and beautify it.\r\nIt fascinates, therefore, not only by its great beauty, the romance\r\nsuggested by wall and tower, but also, and especially, by the variety of\r\nits architecture. Here we can study the master-builder’s art, as gate,\r\nchapel, and tower step forth, in quick succession, to instruct us. The\r\nspace, enclosed by the walls of the castle, is divided into two wards—the\r\nlower and the upper—by the great Round Tower, which occupies the brow of\r\na hill, or mound, commanding the upper ward, which is level, and looking\r\ndown upon the lower ward, which is situated on a gradual incline. The\r\nwalls are pinched together at the Tower, but swell out around either\r\nward, suggesting somewhat the figure eight.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Windsor by the Great Western Railway, and after walking up\r\na little hill, High Street, passing on the left the beautiful Jubilee\r\nstatue of Queen Victoria, we found ourselves at the main entrance of the\r\nlower ward, Henry VIII’s gateway. Notice this splendid example of Tudor\r\narchitecture, built about 1510. Either side of the gateway is flanked\r\nby a mighty tower, which you will notice has three sides to make more\r\neffective the defence. Over the gateway, in a row, may be seen the badges\r\nof Henry: the _fleur-de-lis_, suggesting the English claim to the French\r\ncrown; the Tudor Rose; and the portcullis, used so frequently after the\r\ntwelfth century to protect the gateway from sudden assault.\r\n\r\nMy readers will remember that Henry was rather indulgent to himself in\r\nthe matter of marriages. He experienced, all told, six wives, of whom\r\nProvidence removed two, divorce set aside two more, and the executioner’s\r\naxe cut short the career of the remaining pair.\r\n\r\nHis second wife, Anne Boleyn, the most charming of the lot, whom Henry\r\nfirst married, afterward divorcing her rival, paid the penalty of her\r\nattractiveness, or coquetry, at the executioner’s block in the Tower of\r\nLondon. She, with a gorgeous retinue attending her, was met at this gate\r\nby Henry and welcomed to the place with the assurance that she would\r\nshortly be its real mistress. All this, however, to the great regret of\r\nthe “delegate’s” wife, took place before our arrival.\r\n\r\nHow different is the architecture of the Norman gate with its graceful\r\nround towers! Here, in these chambers which you may see above the\r\nentrance, and in the rooms of the towers themselves, were kept, during\r\nthe struggle between Crown and Parliament, many famous prisoners.\r\n\r\nAs we entered the lower ward, by Henry VIII’s gateway, the beautiful\r\nproportions of St. George’s Chapel rose before us on the left. Adjoining,\r\non the east, is Albert Memorial Chapel, the gem of the entire group.\r\nStill traveling east and ascending the hill, we come first to the\r\nresidence of the Dean and Chapter, and then to the famous Round Tower.\r\nDirectly across from St. George’s the group of buildings is the residence\r\nof the Military Knights, who date from the founding of the order of the\r\nGarter, when Edward III established this to provide for the relief of\r\npoor knights. It was called by Elizabeth, “Poor Knights of Windsor,” but\r\nWilliam IV took away its reproach by giving it the present name.\r\n\r\nThese are the main features of the lower ward, the buildings being\r\ngrouped around a large balloon-shaped court.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WINDSOR CASTLE, NORMAN GATEWAY.\r\n]\r\n\r\nBeyond the Round Tower lies the upper ward, perfectly level, with\r\nstately buildings on three sides of a square which contains a splendid\r\nexample of artistic gardening. The buildings on the north are the State\r\napartments, and those on the south and east the royal suites. This group\r\nhas twenty-four towers, seventeen state apartments, forty-eight rooms,\r\nseventy-nine bedrooms, sixty-five sitting rooms, and rooms containing two\r\nhundred and thirty-one beds for servants.\r\n\r\nOur first objective point was St. George’s Chapel. The exterior of this\r\nbuilding is very beautiful and singularly in harmony with the surrounding\r\nstructures. This effect the architect accomplished by avoiding the use\r\nof the conventional church tower, while at the same time preserving the\r\necclesiastical appearance.\r\n\r\nWe found, within, a group of people in charge of a verger, who was\r\nexplaining to them the various objects of interest. We went our own\r\nway and when we had finished, found that the verger and his flock had\r\ndeparted and the door was locked. It felt, at first, a trifle like being\r\nin jail, but conscious of our rectitude, we waited till the door opened\r\nagain and then passed out. As we had found the door open when we arrived\r\nand had entered in unchallenged, it did not occur to us that the verger\r\nconsidered it necessary to personally conduct us through the building and\r\nbid us farewell when we left; nor did we think that we had in any way\r\nslighted him till the Kentucky parson, who had remained behind to ask\r\na few questions, later reported that the ecclesiastical pathfinder had\r\nenquired of him, with fine scorn, if “that aristocratic party belonged\r\nto him.” The “aristocratic party,” was the professor, the “delegate” and\r\nmyself, who were now safely out of reach, while the verger’s fee jingled\r\nmerrily at the bottom of our pockets.\r\n\r\nOn every hand, at Windsor, are posted notices forbidding the servants\r\nto receive any gratuities, but we learned, that notwithstanding the\r\nseemliness of such a regulation in such a place, none but a novice took\r\nit seriously. Consequently, when we later visited the Royal Stables, we\r\nemerged proudly from the ordeal after having deposited a shilling in the\r\never ready hand of the guide.\r\n\r\nBut to return to the chapel. It was begun by Henry I and mutilated as\r\nusual by the soldiers of the Puritans, and restored again by Charles II\r\nand his successors, but Victoria has perhaps done most for it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HENRY VIII GATEWAY.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThere are many tiny chapels around the various walls, in the fashion of\r\nthe churches of Europe. We noticed, especially, the Braye chapel to the\r\nright of the entrance. On the walls hung a sword and swordbelt, showing\r\nevident marks of service in the field. An inscription explained that they\r\nbelonged to Captain Wyatt-Edgall, who recovered the body of the Prince\r\nImperial, in Zululand. He, himself, was also killed in South Africa. The\r\nsame chapel contains the monument to Prince Imperial—son of Napoleon III\r\nand Eugènie,—who fought with the English in South Africa, and there died.\r\n\r\nA translation of the inscription at the foot of the marble figure—a\r\nfigure of the recumbent prince, grasping his sword which lies along his\r\nbody—reads: “The well-beloved youth, the comrade of our soldiers, slain\r\nin the African war, and thence carried to the tomb of his fathers, and\r\nrepresented in funereal marble in this holy domicile of kings, Queen\r\nVictoria receiveth as her guest.”\r\n\r\nThere is also an interesting extract from the will of the prince, which\r\nreads: “I shall die with a feeling of profound gratitude for her Majesty,\r\nthe Queen of England, and for the royal family, and for the country in\r\nwhich, during eight years, I have received so cordial a hospitality.”\r\n\r\nThe choir, a church within the church, is situated in the center of the\r\nchapel and at the east end. A passage runs the entire way round the sides\r\nand rear. It is raised some four feet above the level of the floor and\r\nis a long gallery with two rows of lateral seats, and an organ, said to\r\nbe the finest choir organ in Europe, at the farthest end. The seats,\r\non either side, are the stalls of the Knights of the Garter. They are\r\nmost elaborately carved from floor to ceiling, decorated with crests and\r\nemblems.\r\n\r\nThe remains of Henry VIII and Lady Jane Seymour, who was neither divorced\r\nnor beheaded, since she lived only a year after her marriage, are buried\r\nbeneath the center of the choir. Under the entire chapel a royal vault\r\nwas constructed by George III, cut out of the chalk rocks below. It is\r\nseventy by twenty by fifteen feet and designed for eighty-one bodies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  THE ROUND TOWER, WINDSOR CASTLE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nDirectly in the rear of St. George’s is Albert Memorial Chapel, the most\r\ninteresting feature, as well as the most artistic and costly creation at\r\nWindsor. The chapel was begun by the pious, though much married, Henry\r\nVIII, who soon abandoned it for Westminster. Constancy was, perhaps, not\r\none of Henry’s strong points. Wolsey, who was Henry’s pope and aspired\r\nto be the real one, begged and obtained the chapel for himself, but\r\nfell from Henry’s favor, as the ladies had done, before he could finish\r\nit. When the Parliamentary forces obtained possession of Windsor, they\r\ndesecrated it as usual, and sold its plunder for $3,000. Wolsey’s\r\nsarcophagus, which escaped, was removed by George III, three hundred\r\nyears later, to St. Paul’s, where it now holds the dust of Nelson.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that Victoria decided to convert this chapel into a\r\nmemorial for the Prince Consort after his death. No expense was spared,\r\nand when it was completed in 1874, its interior rivaled the most splendid\r\necclesiastical structures in the world.\r\n\r\nThe fourteen windows, with panels beneath thirteen of them, are dreams\r\nof art. The windows contain portraits and arms of various kings, queens\r\nand princes, and some symbolical figures. The panels beneath picture\r\nscenes from the Old and New Testaments, suggestive of various virtues and\r\nreligious truths. The chapel contains in the center, besides the Prince’s\r\ncenotaph, the tombs of the Dukes of Albany and Clarence.\r\n\r\nThe Round Tower is the most picturesque feature of the castle. Nothing\r\nis so interesting as a tower. Not a modern tower—a mere imitation—but\r\na real tower, with dungeons, where prisoners have clanked their chains\r\nin despair, with great halls where knights in armor foregathered, with\r\nsecret passages and musty mysteries in every corner—a tower that has\r\nlived on to see this age of civilization superimposed upon its own rough,\r\nready and bloody past.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  VICTORIA TOWER AND SOUTH SIDE.\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe tower is over three hundred feet in circumference and is built on the\r\ntop of a high mound in a most commanding situation. It is reached, after\r\none passes through the Norman Gate, by a long flight of steps, which\r\nis continued up through the structure till the base of the turret is\r\nreached. This flight is commanded by a cannon placed at the head of the\r\nstairs. The turret, a good-sized tower itself, is built upon the top of\r\nthe old tower of George III. Within the turret, the stairs wind around a\r\nmassive bell, brought from Sevastopol.\r\n\r\nFinally the top is reached, three hundred and twenty-five feet from the\r\nground, and we walk round the ample promenade—the turret is twenty-five\r\nfeet wide—dumb in the presence of the loveliness before us. How beautiful\r\nis an English landscape, with its living green, threaded here and there\r\nby the silver sparkle of a stream. West and south we looked out over\r\nWindsor forest and parks, while in the north Eton College was plainly\r\nvisible with the inevitable cricketers, dressed in white flannel, moving\r\nto and fro over the matchless sward, or facing the “crease,” which is, I\r\nbelieve, the “correct” name for the “pitcher’s box.”\r\n\r\nHow much history and mystery might not the walls of this old tower, built\r\nby Edward III, teach us, could they but speak! This tower once contained\r\nthe great round table of the Knights of the Garter and was the home of\r\nthe constable-governors, who were responsible for the safe keeping of the\r\nstate prisoners, among the most famous of whom have been John, of France,\r\nand David, of Scotland.\r\n\r\nAs illustration of the possible mysteries that may still lurk about the\r\ntower, I will mention a recent discovery. While investigating a stone\r\ncover with an iron handle, the mouth of a well was uncovered. It was\r\nfound to descend one hundred and sixty-four feet, to the level of the\r\nThames, and was lined up with masonry most of the way.\r\n\r\nFrom the turret a fine view is obtained of the state and private\r\napartments of the castle. These contain magnificent collections of rare\r\nbric-a-brac and art objects of all kinds. Paintings, tapestries, and\r\nceramics of priceless worth, are kept in the various rooms and galleries.\r\nThe Van Dyck room recalls the fact that this Dutch artist was brought to\r\nEngland, knighted and pensioned by Charles I. There are also a Zuccarelli\r\nroom and a Rubens room, with famous paintings from the artists whose\r\nnames they bear.\r\n\r\nOur next visit was paid to the Royal Stables. Here we were received at\r\nan office, and after registering our names and nativity were put in\r\ncharge of guides. Words cannot do justice to the splendid appearance of\r\nthe well-matched horses, a large proportion of which were greys, and the\r\ncleanliness and order of the stalls. Even the straw beneath the horses’\r\nfeet was unruffled. At the foot of the stall was laid a nicely plaited\r\nbraid of straw, forming a pretty border, and on either side stood little\r\nsheaves of straw, daintily bound, and presenting the appearance of a row\r\nof sentinels down the long line.\r\n\r\nWe were conducted through stable after stable, and shown horses for\r\nall sorts of uses, and horses that were no longer of any use but were\r\npensioners of His Majesty, for services already rendered the State. Then\r\ncame the carriages. Carriages for royal purposes, and for State purposes\r\nand for “breaking in” purposes.\r\n\r\nWhat impressed me most was an old chair on wheels—such as one sees\r\ninvalids moved about in. It was as commonplace looking as one could\r\nwell imagine. To it were attached a pair of shafts, and I recognized\r\nit at once as there rose before me the vision of the Queen, with broad\r\nbrimmed straw hat, and accompanied only by a little child, usually one\r\nof her grandchildren, while a humble donkey ambled through the grounds\r\nof Windsor and pulled the improvised carriage. Such was the picture I\r\nhad seen in the Sunday school papers, and now the sight of the actual\r\ncarriage gave the much needed air of reality. This mode of taking\r\nexercise emphasized at once both the Queen’s independence and simplicity\r\nof manner.\r\n\r\nThe Great Park, adjoining Windsor Castle, contains 18,000 acres. Within\r\nit is located Frogmore House, another royal residence, near which is\r\nthe Royal Mausoleum. Everyone must have been impressed, at some time\r\nor other, with the faithfulness of the late queen to the memory of the\r\nPrince Consort. Throughout her long widowhood, she seems to have lived\r\nin the presence of his death. The monuments, that perpetuate his name,\r\nunless one looks at their artistic value, seem an extravagant waste of\r\nmoney. Certainly he rendered no conspicuous service to the State, so that\r\nwe are justified in regarding these costly memorials as tributes of the\r\nloyal and undying love which the Queen cherished for her husband.\r\n\r\nRoyal marriages, that are so frequently the result of political\r\nexigencies, are not always happy. Perhaps it would not be wide of the\r\nmark to say, are not often happy. All the greater reason, therefore, that\r\nthis one, which was conspicuously congenial, should iterate its testimony.\r\n\r\nOn the fourteenth of December, the anniversary of the Prince’s death,\r\nthe Dean of Windsor regularly held a memorial service at the mausoleum,\r\nduring the lifetime of the Queen. Those who had obtained tickets were\r\nadmitted to the mausoleum after the service, but this was the only date\r\nin the year when it might be seen.\r\n\r\nThe foundation stone of the structure was laid by the Queen, herself, and\r\ncontains the following words:\r\n\r\n  “His mourning widow, the queen, directed all that is mortal\r\n  of Prince Albert, to be placed in this sepulchre, A. D. 1862.\r\n  Farewell, well-beloved: Here at last I will rest with thee; with\r\n  thee, in Christ, I will rise again.”\r\n\r\nWindsor Castle has had a long and varied history; it has been associated\r\nclosely with many of the kings of England and with stirring scenes of\r\nEnglish history, but for many, many years to come, its mention will call\r\nto memory the good and universally beloved woman—Victoria.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE FINEST HOTEL.\r\n\r\n             A SKETCH OF LIFE IN THE MOUNTAINS OF KENTUCKY.\r\n\r\n                          By A. Lytle Peterman.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Boys, is there a hotel in this place?” the traveler asked of two\r\nyoungsters lounging near, as he stood, suit-case in hand, on the cinder\r\npath by the track, looking inquiringly about him, while the train pulled\r\noff down the road.\r\n\r\n“What place?” putting answer and inquiry into one. It aroused their\r\ninterest and surprise to hear Montvale called a “place.”\r\n\r\n“This village, or hamlet, or station, or whatever you call it—is there a\r\nhotel hereabout?” he replied, a little impatient and determined to make\r\nhimself understood.\r\n\r\n“A hotel? Yes, _sir_,” answered the larger of the boys.\r\n\r\n“Then I’ll thank you and pay you to show me to it,” the stranger said, as\r\nhe brightened up, throwing off the lost look that had struck his face at\r\nthe same moment his foot had struck the cinders, when he stepped from the\r\ntrain.\r\n\r\n“All right; up this a-way,” the larger boy answered, as he turned into\r\nthe path, and the smaller fell in behind him. The traveler and his\r\nsuit-case, side by side, brought up the rear. The boys were agreeable,\r\nbut not over-polite, neither thinking to say, “I’ll take the baggage.”\r\n\r\nWhen they had gone perhaps a hundred yards, the traveler’s eyes all the\r\nwhile seeking sight of a hotel and finding none, the leader stopped\r\nsuddenly, raised his arm, pointed his finger back down the railway, and\r\nremarked, “The _finest_ hotel is ’way down hyander.”\r\n\r\n“Very well,” said the stranger, an experienced traveler, therefore past\r\nthe “kicking” stage; “take me to the finest.”\r\n\r\nThe procession faced about, headed down the track, retraced its steps,\r\npassed the depot, and continued on its way.\r\n\r\nBut we are not yet to “the finest hotel.” In fact, there is time to “view\r\nthe landscape o’er” before we arrive, especially as the boys are quiet,\r\nremarkably quiet for Kentucky boys—“mighty say-nothin’ shavers,” as the\r\nlandlady afterwards described them to her guest.\r\n\r\nIt was dusk, on a Sunday evening in September. The rain had just begun\r\nfalling gently—the prelude to the first cool snap of the autumn. The\r\nstranger had left the train to spend the night, preparatory to his\r\ncross-country trip on the following day.\r\n\r\nMontvale is a station on the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway, in the mountains\r\nof Kentucky, seventy-five or a hundred miles east of Lexington. It is\r\nof consequence chiefly because it is on the road to somewhere else—the\r\npoint of departure from the railway to the country lying beyond. Contrary\r\nto the rule, its inhabitants seemed to realize its urban limitations,\r\nespecially the meagerness of its population. The two boys, unprepared for\r\nsuch compliment, were surprised to hear it called a “place.”\r\n\r\nAt that time, less than a decade ago—and doubtless ever since,—Montvale\r\nstraggled around over a wide expanse of flat woods and weedy fields,\r\nbetween ranges. Space to spare was the most striking thing about it. The\r\nland, too swampy for tillage, except after elaborate artificial drainage,\r\nwas “good to fill a hole in the ground and hold the world together.”\r\n\r\nThe houses, after the “boxed” style of carpentry, seemed not to have\r\nbeen built, but to have grown up, like the weeds. They had never peeped\r\ninto a paint-bucket; their complexion was that of the crawfish land on\r\nwhich they stood. Most of the doors, off the hinges, whether they ever\r\nhad any or not, stood leaning against the inside wall, ready in case a\r\nstorm or other emergency arose.\r\n\r\nThere was little direct communication between the homes, partly because\r\nthe weeds overhung the pig-trails of travel; partly because it was about\r\na Sabbath-day’s journey from each house to its nearest neighbor; partly\r\nbecause all paths led to or through the depot yard, as the literal\r\nand figurative center of the hamlet. The railway station was at once\r\nthe market, the park, the amusement hall, the shipping center, the\r\nbusiness section, the social resort, the lounging place, the nursery and\r\nplayground of all Montvale. The railway track, with the path beside it,\r\nwas the main and only street of the “place.”\r\n\r\nJust as the traveler was wondering if they were going to tramp down to\r\nthe next station, the leader said, “Out this hyer way,” turning off\r\nto the right, through a sea of white-topped weeds. The rain was still\r\nfalling, and night had come on. A few pale rays of the moon, struggling\r\nthrough the clouds, showed the boys’ heads now and then bobbing above the\r\nwatery weeds, like porpoises at play on the surface of the ocean.\r\n\r\nAt last, the little procession reached a plank fence with a gap in it.\r\nThe boys stopped, confronted the traveler, and the leader said, “_This_\r\nis the finest hotel anywhar about hyer.”\r\n\r\n“Where?” the stranger asked.\r\n\r\n“Right yander—go through this gate,” tapping with his hand a piece of\r\nframe-work standing across the path.\r\n\r\nThe boys took the proffered pay, dropped it into their pockets, thrust\r\ntheir hands down to keep it from getting out, and plunged again into the\r\ndepths of the weedy sea.\r\n\r\nThe traveler peered through the rain and fog into the yard, where the\r\nweeds had lost so much of their stature that he thought he must be\r\nnearing the shore. He picked up the gate leaning across the path, from\r\npanel to panel of the fence, and set it out of the way, remarking,\r\n“Everything about here is off its hinges—I’m nearly off myself.”\r\n\r\nHe approached the “hotel,” consisting mostly of “boxed” lean-to, and\r\nrested one foot upon the sill of the shed—by courtesy known as the\r\n“porch.” He paused; in the language of eastern railway danger signs, he\r\nthought he would “Stop, Look and Listen.” Silence and the clouds reigned.\r\nNo sound but the patter of the drops on the roof. No light gleamed from\r\nthe skimpy window, nor crept through the generous cracks in the wall.\r\n\r\nHe rapped at the door; no answer. He rapped again—louder; still no\r\nanswer. There must be nobody at home in “the finest hotel.” So he\r\nhammered the rickety, raky, crazy shutter just because there wasn’t, till\r\nit shook, rattled and shivered, and the boards on the rear wall creaked\r\nand groaned in sympathy.\r\n\r\nA cracked, rasping, whining voice from the inner depths called out,\r\n“Well!”\r\n\r\n“Madam”—for that voice could belong to none but a crone—“I want to get to\r\nstay over night.”\r\n\r\n“This is a purty time o’ night to be a-prowlin’ ’round, a-draggin’ uv\r\nhonest, hard-workin’ folks out’n the bed ter wait on ye,” the landlady\r\nreplied. The reprimand came mixed with the rattle of straw-ticks and the\r\nrustle of bedclothing.\r\n\r\n“I am sorry,” the traveler answered, “but I came as early as I could.\r\nReally, I am neither the conductor, engineer, nor superintendent of that\r\ntrain. Don’t you keep hotel?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, sorter, a leetle, sometimes, when I feel like it. But can’t ye wait\r\ntell a body gits on her cloze; ur will ye jist come in anyhow, whether ur\r\nno?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, certainly, I’ll gladly wait,” the traveler said; “take your own\r\ntime—mine, too.”\r\n\r\n“Whar air you frum?” asked the voice from within, somewhat muffled as it\r\npoked its head up through a calico dress.\r\n\r\n“I don’t see what that has to do with it, but I came directly from\r\nLexington.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I ’lowed so;” she answered. “I jist thought it ’uz some o’ them\r\nBluegrass fellers what sets up all night and sleeps all day—what hain’t\r\nnothin’ to do but keep awake them that has to work.”\r\n\r\nAfter taking time enough to have arrayed herself for presentation to the\r\nqueen, Madame Calico now approached the door, holding a little sputtering\r\nbrass lamp—apparently the model of the first invention—in one hand, while\r\nshe vainly tried to tie her apron strings with the other. She knocked\r\nup the wooden latch with her elbow and a clatter, and the door swung\r\nopen. Holding high her lamp—a rustic model for “Liberty Enlightening the\r\nWorld”—she waited for the stranger to speak.\r\n\r\n“Madame, I’m very sorry—,” he began.\r\n\r\n“Yes, I know it,” she snapped, cutting him off from the remainder of his\r\nsentence. “’Bout ever’ thing ’at comes frum Lex’n’ton’s sorry, mighty\r\nsorry. Guess they’s some good people down thar, but I hain’t never seed\r\n’em. They don’t never come up hyer. I _reckin_ you kin stay, but I can’t\r\ngive ye no bed all to yerself; an’ I tell ye now, ye needn’t to ax it.”\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Madame Calico had admitted him and led the way through a\r\nside door into an adjoining room which served as a lounging hall for\r\nguests, whether “by the day” or “by the week.” Having learned how to make\r\nallowances for the moods of hotels, landlords and landladies, he had\r\nfollowed meekly, without invitation.\r\n\r\nBy “the dim and flaring lamp,” he now caught the outlines of a\r\nhalf-finished stairway winding up to the garret. There was no railing to\r\nthis gangway; safety consisted in keeping away from the brink. Madame\r\nCalico stood on the third step, her countenance and kerosene jet beaming\r\ncontemptuously down upon the upturned face of the hesitating guest at the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\n“Madam,” he asked, hearing, as he thought, a chorus of snores winding\r\ndown the gangway, “does anybody else sleep up there?”\r\n\r\n“No, they hain’t nobody hardly now, sence the mill ’uz shot down.” Rather\r\nan evasive answer.\r\n\r\n“How many?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“The mill is shot down, an’ most uv the hands has quit work, an’ they\r\nhain’t many stays hyer now.”\r\n\r\nThe guest, growing insistent, asked the third time, as he took a single,\r\nhesitating step upward, “Well, who are they—can’t you say just how many?”\r\n\r\nMadame Calico, now on the defensive, grew more amiable—rather, less\r\nhostile—, but again took refuge in “the mill” and its shutting down:\r\n“Sence the mill wuz shot down, the’ve mos’ly all went away; they’s hardly\r\nany ub ’em left now.”\r\n\r\nThe guest was growing impatient, as she could readily see. Not liking the\r\noutlook, he stopped, turned as if to descend, and once more demanded,\r\n“Well, Madam, will you tell me just how many or not?”\r\n\r\nShe was loath to lose her guest and his pay, “after a-bein’ drug out’n”\r\nher bed. So she at last came to the point, but in her own roundabout\r\nway: “Sence the mill ’uz shot down they hain’t nobody sca’cely sleeps\r\nup hyer—nobody but Sam Thompson, an’ Tim Turney, an’ Joe Alley, an’ Bob\r\nRedford, an’ Jack Johnson, an’ Bill Ed Jeckley—I b’lieve them’s all—oh,\r\nyes, an’ Less Wilson. You kin sleep with Bill Ed, but he won’t sleep\r\nnowhar exceptin’ the fore side uv the bed.”\r\n\r\n“Well,” the traveler muttered to himself, “in an adventure, even a\r\nformidable certainty is better than a gloomy doubt.”\r\n\r\nThey had now reached the landing at the angle in the wall. Madame Calico\r\nhanded the little lamp to the guest, and turned to go, saying, “You kin\r\nbunk up with Bill Ed.”\r\n\r\n“But how shall I know Bill Ed from the others?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“W’y, he’s in the empty bed by hisself; t’others is a-sleepin’ three an’\r\nfour tergether. Bill Ed won’t sleep ’ith none uv ’em, ’caze, he says,\r\nhe ruther sleep ’ith a meal-sack uv augers an’ hammers then ’ith a man.\r\nSometimes I jist have to slip a stranger like you in terhin’ him, an’\r\nBill Ed don’t know nothin’ about it tell mornin’.”\r\n\r\nAs she clambered down the gangway, hugging the wall, and the new guest\r\ncrept up into the garret, he called out, “What time do we rise in the\r\nmorning?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, most any time,” she answered. “Sence the mill ’uz shot down, ever’\r\nfeller jist suits hisself about crawlin’ out.”\r\n\r\n“About what hour?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“Well, when the mill ’uz a-runnin’ we used to git up purty soon, but\r\nsence hit ’uz shot down we’re all sorter lazy-like, so we purty giner’ly\r\nal’ays have late eatin’.”\r\n\r\n“But, Madam, please name the hour for breakfast,” he insisted.\r\n\r\n“Well, you kin do purty much to suit yerself sence the mill ’uz shot\r\ndown. Jest sleep ez late as yer please. We al’ays eat late when comp’ny’s\r\nhyer, sence the mill ’uz shot down. So you git yer hands an’ face washed\r\nan’ ready by four o’clock’ll do.”\r\n\r\nNo wonder the mill hands went to bed before nightfall! They had to, in\r\norder to get in in time to get out.\r\n\r\nTill now, the sounds coming down from the garret had blended into\r\nsomething like harmony. When the new guest neared the top of the gangway,\r\nit seemed to him like poking his head into a den of infuriated wild\r\nbeasts. The roaring, growling and groaning made “confusion dire and\r\ndreadful din.”\r\n\r\nA glance around caused him to wonder how many slept in that one room\r\nbefore “the mill ’uz shot down.”\r\n\r\nThe bedsteads were made from pieces of undressed scantling, nailed\r\ntogether; not one of them had ever felt a plane or seen a chisel. The\r\nlittle forest of posts and frames looked like a railway trestle; and\r\nthe groans and sighs issuing from it sounded as if an express train had\r\njust plunged over, mangling passengers and crew. The mill “hands” lay\r\nuncovered in that stifling atmosphere, tumbled and tangled into all\r\nshapes and attitudes, looking like a band of contortionists struck dead,\r\neach in the midst of his favorite trick. There lay Bill Ed—two hundred\r\nfifty pounds of mountaineer—spread along the front railing, his arm\r\nthrown out and hanging over, to keep him from rolling back and wedging\r\nhimself under the rafters of the roof. His was the “empty bed”—fairly on\r\nthe way to occupancy!\r\n\r\nThe new guest, lifting his lamp and peering over huge Bill Ed to the\r\nsleeping place beyond, observed to himself, “In the language of the sweet\r\ngirl graduate, ‘Beyond the Alps lies Italy.’ The ‘valley’ is all right,\r\nif I can ever scale the mountain.”\r\n\r\nBut he found an easier way. He undressed, sneaked into the “valley” from\r\nthe foot of the bed, and taking care not to thrust his nose against the\r\nroof, he stretched himself out, but not to sleep—to listen! His entrance\r\nhad not disturbed the snorers. In fact, it had seemed to give them a new\r\ninspiration, for the expiration grew louder. They might have supplied\r\nsteam enough to keep the mill from shutting down. They made up a whole\r\nband of wind instruments, each blowing a different horn. The listener now\r\nhad time to analyze and classify them.\r\n\r\nOne sounded like a March gust whistling through the splinters on the\r\nend of a hickory rail. Another had the hiss of the air-brake under a\r\npassenger coach, when the train is about to start. There was one gasp\r\nlike the continued tearing of brown domestic, and another that made you\r\nlook around for a stream of broken stones pouring into a tin bucket. One\r\nlong-winded horn, out of tune with all others, hissed like a jet of steam\r\nescaping from the steam-chest when a heavy freight engine is beginning\r\nto move. Bill Ed, evidently the sawyer of the mill, had a long-drawn\r\nsnort like the sound of a circular saw ripping through a seasoned oak,\r\nclosing with the confused ring of the steel as it clears the end of the\r\nlog, combined with the clatter of the “carriage” rushing back for a fresh\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nTo sleep amid such a din was a problem. By and by the traveler dozed\r\noff, but not out of reach of that roar—it lingered in the distance. At\r\nlast it ceased—the snorers had risen and gone!\r\n\r\nJust when well asleep—so it seemed to him—, a bell—it must have been\r\nfirst cousin to the little lamp—tinkled on the gangway. The traveler\r\nwithdrew from the crevice between rafter and railing—where he had\r\nliterally lodged,—and turned over.\r\n\r\nBy and by a cow-bell bellowed, not rang, in the lounging hall below. The\r\ntraveler turned over once more, yawned, slumbered again.\r\n\r\nAfter a time—the clock knew how long—, a conch-shell thrust up the\r\ngangway roared; and the sleeper, thinking it a through freight, pushed\r\non, making for the next station.\r\n\r\nAnother silence. At last, behold, Madame Calico stood at the foot of the\r\ngangway, and shouted: “Air you a-gona git up to-day? Ur do ye want me to\r\ngit yer breakfas’ and then drag ye out’n the bed, an’ put yer cloze on\r\nye, an’ wash ye, an’ chaw yer victuals fur ye?”\r\n\r\n“I’ll be down in a moment, Madam,” the traveler answered.\r\n\r\n“Ever’body but you has eat an’ gone, an’ done furgot hit, by this time,”\r\nshe replied. “You’ll fin’ the wash-pan a-settin’ on the porch.”\r\n\r\nHe arose, dressed hurriedly, made his way down, and by raking around on\r\nthe “porch,” finally stumbled against the wash-pan. The morning was still\r\ndark, but a gray spot was in the eastern sky—daylight was on its way to\r\n“the finest hotel.”\r\n\r\nToilet finished, with the aid of his handkerchief in place of a towel,\r\nhe began wondering where the dining-room could be. He heard no footsteps\r\nabout the “hotel,” and search revealed neither kitchen nor fire. Peering\r\naround, he at last caught sight of smoke curling up from a stick-and-clay\r\nchimney some hundred yards away, beyond a bay of the weedy sea he had\r\ncrossed the evening before. Parting the weeds overhanging the path was\r\nmuch like swimming across.\r\n\r\nBreakfast—varied, wholesome, well-cooked—was on the table—had been for\r\nan hour or more. Madame Calico, first seeing him seated and busy, then\r\nremarked, “You’ll jist have to wait on yerself, but I reckin ye ain’t\r\nnoways bashful. I’ll have to go back to the hotel to clean up atter ye.\r\nIt’s a blessed thing the mill’s shot down, fur we couldn’t a-had no sich\r\nlayin’ up in the bed a-soakin’ an’ a-sobbin’ this time o’ day, ’way hyer\r\nmight’ nigh dinner.” He was not sorry to make his meal in silence, peace\r\nand the landlady’s absence.\r\n\r\nBreakfast finished, the guest made his way back toward his lodging place.\r\nTurning the corner and confronting the entrance, he read, on a board\r\nover the shed, the name of “the finest hotel,” “Traveler’s Rest;” and\r\nimmediately, by the law of contrast, his memory reverted to the garret,\r\nthe snoring, Bill Ed and the “empty bed,”—to the hand-bell, the cow-bell\r\nand the conch-shell.\r\n\r\nJust before he paid his bill and left, in quest of a turnout for the\r\nday’s drive, Madame Calico, still in the act of cleaning up, favored him\r\nwith her views on affairs in and about Montvale, and divers and sundry\r\nbits of information—some of a startling kind. “No,” she said, “the hotel\r\nbusiness don’t amount to nothin’ much sence the mill ’uz shot down. Wunst\r\nin a while some feller comes stragglin’ along way hyander in the night,\r\nwhen all honest white folks is asleep, but the trouble o’ waitin’ on ’im\r\nan’ cleanin’ up atter ’im’s more’n the pay.\r\n\r\n“Them revenue men an’ marshals an’ sich rakin’s an’ scrapin’s uv the\r\nyearth has might nigh ruint Montvale. A passel uv ’em comes here t’other\r\nday—jist week afore last—an’ axes me ’bout Sam Ben Jeckley’s ’stillery,\r\nwhar it wuz. Sam Ben is Bill Ed’s brother. An’ I up an’ tells ’em I don’t\r\nknow nothin’ about it—hain’t never seed it, nur smelt it, nur tasted it,\r\nnur been about it, nur had nothin’ to do with it, in no shape, size,\r\nform, nur fashion.\r\n\r\n“They said they knowed it ’uz around hyer somewhar. An’ sir, they\r\nrummaged over this lan’ an’ country a-s’archin’ fur that ’stillery—hit uz\r\nthe mill the hands worked at. Atter cavortin’ aroun’ two ur three days,\r\nlike a lot o’ male-cows a-tarrin’ up a paster, they afinally finds the\r\nmill—’stillery, as they called it—about two miles frum hyer.\r\n\r\n“An’ they taken axes an’ smashed the whole thing tell they wuz nuther\r\nha’r nur hide uv it left. An’ they spilt out three tanks o’ sour-mash\r\nbyer, an’ we hain’t had none fur the table sence. It beats all uv yer\r\nsasafac tea, yer spicewood tea, an’ yer Californy byer.\r\n\r\n“They poured out five barl’s uv the best whisky—’cordin’ to what’s said\r\nuv it—that ever went to town on ’lection day. They say jist one drink\r\n’ould run a man wil’ enough fur the ’sylum, an’ one drap ’ould make a\r\nrabbit pick a qua’rl with a bull-dog, ef he had to spit in his face to do\r\nit.\r\n\r\n“It’s all sech ez that has ruint the country—stark-nater’ly wiped\r\nbusiness out’n Montvale. The dirty, low-flunged, lazy good-fur-nothin’\r\nimps uv the devil, prowlin’ aroun’, ’stroyin’ what other people’s sweat\r\nhas earnt!\r\n\r\n“But still they wuzn’t satisfied! Then they went up above the\r\nmill—’stillery, as they called it—, an’ drawed the’r Winchesters an’\r\nSmith & Westerns, an’ farred bullets all through the ruff, an’ poked\r\nthe door ez full o’ holes ez a sifter. They jest blowed the whole thing\r\nbodyaciously all to flugens an’ flinderations, with the’r guns an’\r\npistols.\r\n\r\n“An’ that’s how the mill come to be shot down,” she added, as her parting\r\nguest once more lifted the gate aside.\r\n\r\n“Good day, Madam,” he said, as he lifted it back.\r\n\r\n“Wush ye well,” she answered. “Ef ye’re ever hyer agin, come to see us—I\r\n_reckin_ we kin stand ye, an’ Bill Ed won’t know nothin’ about it tell\r\nhe’s up an’ out. He may be gone by that time any way, fur he’s speenied\r\nto Feder’l Court up at Louisville purty soon, fur a witness ’gin the\r\ngovernment, to swar Sam Ben an’ tother ’shiners out’n trouble.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said the traveler to himself, “when I put up again at ‘the finest\r\nhotel,’ Bill Ed will be gone—to Federal Court, or some lower or higher\r\ntribunal.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         INDEFINITELY POSTPONED.\r\n\r\n                         By Eva Williams Malone.\r\n\r\n      [During the period immediately following the Civil War, many\r\n      former slaves, after living in matrimonial harmony for years,\r\n       were “married over again.” The writer recalls several such\r\n           instances on her father’s plantation in Tennessee.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Josiah Crabtree, gentleman of color, Grand Master of the Lodge of\r\nColored Masons and holder of various other offices of emolument and\r\ntrust, had, metaphorically speaking, run against a snag. Being a plain\r\nand simple man of direct methods, the ornate made small appeal to his\r\nmentality. However, Mr. Crabtree had consented to argue the matter; and,\r\nin differences matrimonial, the husband who argues is lost.\r\n\r\n“But, Penelope,” he began—he always called his wife Penelope when they\r\ndisagreed, possibly because she disliked the name—“Penelope, what’s de\r\nuse ob it?

Nothin’ ’tall; ain’t nothin’ t’ be did! Des let ’em come ’long t’\r\ndere Ma’s an’ Pa’s weddin’, an’ unnerstan’ dat effen we wuz bawn in\r\nslavery, an’ got mahried by jumpin’ de broomstick, we’se keepin’ up wid\r\nde pussession now. Mis’ Hapgood had her Aleck as one o’ de ushers when\r\nher an’ he’s pa got mahried las’ mon’; so we’ll des let our Orleeny be de\r\nmaid o’ honnah. Dat’s de berry lates’ style.”\r\n\r\nSo, despite his perfect content with matters as they were, Mr. Crabtree\r\nlistened to the siren voice, and finally consented, after twenty years of\r\napparent matrimony, to have the entire thing done over again according to\r\npost-bellum methods, and in a style befitting American citizens living\r\nin the full blaze of an amended constitution. Yes, Mr. and Mrs. Crabtree\r\nwere to be married again; by a preacher, with a license, in a church,\r\nwith a gold ring. Orleeny was to be maid of honor, and Cato, in all the\r\nglory of white cotton gloves and other festal accessories, was to be\r\nusher in chief. In his honest soul Mr. Crabtree thought the whole thing\r\nunmitigated nonsense; but, like many a man with a lighter skin, concluded\r\nthat, if nothing else would make his wife happy and give her proper éclat\r\nbefore the members of her S’ciety, he would consent to be a reluctant\r\nvictim on the altar of matrimonial precedent!\r\n\r\n“Effen you gwine do the t’ing, you might ez well do it right”—was his\r\nconclusion, in which his progressive wife fully coincided. A tidy little\r\nsum that had gradually accumulated in the bank was drawn out; and\r\npreparations for the belated nuptials went on apace. It was to be not\r\nonly a church wedding, but a S’ciety wedding likewise, where the various\r\n“Orders” with which Mr. and Mrs. Crabtree affiliated were to appear in\r\nfull regalia and lend spectacular glory to the occasion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  A few self-pitying tears fell on the shirt bosom Mrs. Crabtree\r\n  was ironing.\r\n]\r\n\r\n“Dere ain’t nothin’ fitten to be bought in dis heah measly little town,”\r\nargued Mrs. Crabtree. “We’ll des git on de cyars an’ go ober t’ de county\r\nseat an’ lay in de trosso; you’ll hatter go dere for de license anyhow.”\r\n\r\nBy the time they had purchased a “trosso” befitting a sixteen-year-old\r\nbride, Mr. Crabtree’s arms were heavy-laden. The bride-to-be, radiant\r\nwith visions of her coming loveliness, beamed upon him and insisted that\r\nan entire suit of black broadcloth for the groom was indispensable.\r\n\r\n“Why, Pennie, it ’pears lak dat las’ blue suit dat ol’ Mas’ gin me ’ud\r\ndo berry well. We could shine up de brass buttons an’ freshen it up wid\r\nbenzine—” protested Mr. Crabtree, with prudent consideration for his fast\r\ndiminishing exchequer.\r\n\r\n“Now, honey,” insisted Mrs. Crabtree in her most coquettish manner, “you\r\ndon’t ’spose I’m gwine ’low a good-lookin’ man lak you t’ ma’ch up de ile\r\nin dat ol’ blue suit, an’ me des ez fresh ez de mawnin’ jew in dat white\r\nswiss an ’dat long veil! An’ you de Master o’ de Lodge, too? It ’ud be\r\nscan’lous!”\r\n\r\nSo the broadcloth suit was added to the multitudinous bundles; and, at\r\nthe suggestion of Mrs. Crabtree, deposited with their grocer for safe\r\nkeeping. Then the bridal pair hastened towards the courthouse to procure\r\nthe license. When this priceless document had been filled in with due\r\nsolemnity, Mr. and Mrs. Crabtree felt their ante-nuptial arrangements\r\nwere well-nigh perfected. As, arm in arm, and at peace with all the world\r\nthey ambled towards the grocery store to reclaim their relinquished\r\npackages, Mrs. Crabtree exclaimed:\r\n\r\n“Lawsee, Si! we done furgit de ring!”\r\n\r\nThe selection of the golden circlet that was to bind them in renewed\r\nwedded security was so momentous a question that the sun was slipping\r\nbehind the hills before it was satisfactorily accomplished. At this\r\njuncture the absorbed bridal party recalled the fact that it must be\r\nnearly train time.\r\n\r\n“We’ll des race ober t’ de grocery sto’ an’ grab up our bundles an’ scoot\r\nt’ de depo’—” urged Mr. Crabtree as he impelled his panting companion\r\nonward.\r\n\r\n“Your bundles? Ah, yes; to be sure,” said the custodian of the “trosso;”\r\n“they’re all right. The colored man you sent after them carried them to\r\nthe station some time ago.”\r\n\r\n“De cullud man whot I sont atter em?” ejaculated Mr. Crabtree, with\r\nbulging eyes.\r\n\r\n“Yes, he said you had been delayed, and would go straight to the train\r\nfrom the courthouse. Isn’t that all right?”\r\n\r\n“Golly! I should say it wan’t all right!” cried the prospective groom,\r\nforgetting in the stress of the moment the dignity becoming the Master\r\nof the Lodge. “I ain’t never sont nobody atter dem bundles; I wouldn’ a\r\ntrusted ’em wid de preacher hisse’f effen he’d a been a dark-complected\r\ngenterman! What for looks was dat thievin’ nigger?”\r\n\r\nThe grocer’s face wore a look of puzzlement:\r\n\r\n“Why, I couldn’t tell for my life. I didn’t notice him specially; I just\r\nsupposed of course you sent him. Better go over to the station—maybe\r\nyou’ll find your stuff there all right.”\r\n\r\nBut this cheerful prophecy failed of fulfillment, as no clue to the\r\nmissing “trosso” or its mysterious purloiner could be gained.\r\n\r\n“Dem Jingo mines closed down yistiddy, an’ dis heah town’s full o’\r\nloafin’ thievin’ niggers—” Mr. Crabtree explained to his wife after\r\ntwo hours’ diligent search had failed to disclose any clue to thief or\r\npackages; “some ob ’em is hyerd us ’scussin’ our plans, an’ has followed\r\nus an’ swiped dat trosso.”\r\n\r\nWhich very plausible solution did credit to Mr. Crabtree’s powers of\r\ndiscernment.\r\n\r\nWeary, footsore, with blighted hopes and flabby pocket-book, a\r\ndisgruntled colored gentleman and lady boarded the midnight train for\r\nDucktown. On the lady’s finger a golden circlet gleamed in mocking irony;\r\nfrom the gentleman’s coat pocket a superfluous marriage license protruded.\r\n\r\n“What you gwine do about it?” the gentleman finally took heart of grace\r\nand demanded of his sulky spouse.\r\n\r\n“Don’t ax me what I’m gwine do! Effen I tole you, you’d be sho’ t’ put in\r\nan’ do sumpin t’ spile de whole puffommance. You might a knowed sumpin\r\ngwine happen t’ dat trosso when you tuhn it loose.”\r\n\r\nWith true feminine logic Mrs. Crabtree entirely overlooked the fact that\r\nthe relinguishment of the packages was her own suggestion.\r\n\r\n“I can tell you one t’ing,” she resumed with asperity, “dere ain’t gwine\r\nbe no weddin’ wid dat trosso gone a glimmerin’! You can des put dat in\r\nyo’ pipe an’ smoke it!”\r\n\r\nLater, as Mr. Crabtree extinguished the candle before retiring, he\r\nobserved that his wife took a vial labelled “_Ipecac_” and stealthily\r\ndeposited it beneath her pillow. But for this timely observation, the\r\nviolent illness with which Mrs. Crabtree aroused the household the next\r\nmorning would doubtless have caused graver concern in Mr. Crabtree’s\r\nkindly soul.\r\n\r\nFor some days Orleeny, whose epistolary attainments were the pride of the\r\nCrabtree household, was closeted with her suffering parent; and later,\r\neach individual who had been bidden to the intercepted nuptials received\r\nthe following announcement:\r\n\r\n“Owing to the suddent illness of the Bride, the marriage of Mr. and Mrs.\r\nJosiah Crabtree have been indeffanately bosboned.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                       TO ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON.\r\n\r\n                         BY ISABELLA HOWE FISK.\r\n\r\n     “Carry the lad that was born to be king over the sea to Skye.”\r\n\r\n\r\n          Thoughts wait upon me, grateful thoughts that throng\r\n          Prayer-wise and eager. To the master’s feet\r\n          I fain would speed them, offering tribute meet.\r\n          But, mute for very love, I cannot voice my song.\r\n          Dear chief of utterance, I have lingered long\r\n          As at deep wells in shimmering noons of heat,\r\n          And like dumb beasts that drain the waters sweet,\r\n          I, too, have quenched my thirst, and, silent have grown strong.\r\n          Dear Louis—best of kings to bear the name.\r\n          I think a smile still quivers on thy face\r\n          That oval-wise, soul-white and bravely strong,\r\n          Bears eyes, that look low loves and lives to shame.\r\n          Thou, unawares, hast learned new lore of upward ways,\r\n          And wondering taught the words—“The king can do no wrong.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n              TRAINING SCHOOLS IN TENNESSEE AND THE SOUTH.\r\n\r\n                   By James H. Kirkland, D.C.L., Ph.D.\r\n\r\n       Illustrated by views of the Campus, Vanderbilt University.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is the purpose of this paper to describe an educational movement that\r\nhas grown largely out of the influence of Vanderbilt University. In its\r\nrelation toward secondary schools this institution has been impelled by\r\nthe necessity of securing students. At the opening of the University\r\nthere were two methods of procedure open. One was to put the requirements\r\nfor admission at a point where they could easily be met even by untrained\r\npupils; the other was to adopt a high standard, exclude unprepared\r\nstudents, and accept the burden of getting them ready to meet these\r\nrequirements. It has been this latter policy that has brought about the\r\nvital connection between Vanderbilt University and a large number of\r\npreparatory schools.\r\n\r\nSouthern educational conditions are bad enough now, but they were far\r\nworse in 1875, the year Vanderbilt University opened its doors. At that\r\ntime the public school systems of the South were striving to get under\r\nway and make some impression on the mass of illiterates. Nothing could\r\nbe attempted outside a few favored cities in the way of public high\r\nschools. The common schools were running ninety-three days in the year,\r\nspending 81 cents per capita of population and meagerly educating 45\r\nper cent of the school population. Clearly it was useless to await the\r\ncoming of the public high school. The old antebellum academies for the\r\nmost part had passed out of existence. Here and there a few survived,\r\npreserving charters that antedated the war and memories of happier and\r\nmore prosperous existence. If the early copies of the reports of the\r\nCommissioner of Education are consulted there will be found few secondary\r\nschools having any historic background. The Episcopal High School near\r\nAlexandria, Va., has a charter dating from 1854. The Abingdon Male\r\nAcademy was organized in 1822, and the Bingham School at Mebaneville,\r\nN. C., in 1793. These and quite a number of others opened again after\r\nthe end of the Civil War, but most of them had a brief and uncertain\r\ncareer. In the report for 1877, the earliest one at hand as this is\r\nwritten, we find also mentioned the old Mt. Zion Institute of Winnsboro,\r\nS. C., then in charge of R. Means Davis, who was afterwards prominently\r\nknown in the educational history of that state. Others are the Hanover\r\nAcademy, Taylorsville, Va., the Yeates School, Belleville, Va.; Fletcher\r\nInstitute, Thomasville, Ga.; Dawson Institute, White Plains, Ga. The\r\nMadison Academy, Rutledge, Tenn., has now become a public high school,\r\nthe Sam Houston Academy at Jasper, Tenn., has given place to Pryor\r\nInstitute, and Green River Academy at Elkton, Ky., to the Vanderbilt\r\nTraining School at the same place. Of all those mentioned only two, the\r\nEpiscopal High School and the Bingham School, seemed to be really taking\r\nup the task of preparing students for college. Each of these sent ten\r\nstudents to college from the class of 1877.\r\n\r\nAs an attempt to meet the educational needs of the South, quite a large\r\nnumber of new schools sprang into being between 1870 and 1880. These were\r\ngenerally considered academies or secondary schools, but undoubtedly\r\nmost of their pupils were of an elementary age. In many cases the\r\nteachers were unprepared for their tasks. They were doing the best they\r\ncould, trying to instruct according to the needs of their pupils and\r\ntrying to make a living for themselves. Many an old soldier and many a\r\ngood woman, whose property was gone and whose natural supporters had\r\nfallen on the battle field, took up these opportunities to earn a scant\r\nsubsistence. From such schools, few if any students went to college. The\r\npreparation was insufficient, the atmosphere of school life was not such\r\nas to awaken a desire for a college education, and the colleges made no\r\neffort to get in touch with the schools. In the report just mentioned,\r\nof 1877, about forty such schools—male academies—are enumerated in\r\nTennessee, yet it was a rare thing for one of their pupils to go to\r\ncollege.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn general the preparation for college was done by the colleges\r\nthemselves. Practically all established preparatory departments; in many\r\ncases the college professors taught these departments, and frequently\r\nthey contained more students than the college classes proper. As\r\nendowments had been swept away and state appropriations hardly begun, the\r\nfaculty had to be supported from the fees alone. In 1877 East Tennessee\r\nUniversity, now the University of Tennessee at Knoxville, Tenn., is\r\ncredited with 195 preparatory students and 90 college students; the\r\nUniversity of Mississippi with 257 preparatory and 174 college students;\r\nSouth Carolina College with 95 preparatory and 89 college students. Where\r\nsome other institutions give no reports of preparatory students, we are\r\ninclined to believe it was because these had been fully incorporated\r\nwith college students, under a most injudicious system of grouping,\r\nrather than that they were altogether lacking. From that system with all\r\nits faults we have not yet recovered. The best Southern colleges and\r\nuniversities have tried to eliminate this preparatory work, and where\r\nthis could not be done, they have established independent academies,\r\ndissociated from all connection with the college proper. But quite a\r\nlarge number have not been able to take this step and still maintain the\r\nconfused practice of reconstruction days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWorse than the evils above enumerated was the creation of a number of\r\nchartered colleges and universities that were really nothing more than\r\nhigh schools, and in many cases did not furnish as good an education as\r\nan honest academy. Such institutions of course never sent students to\r\ncollege, but rewarded with baccalaureate and master degrees attainments\r\ninsufficient to grace a freshman. Instead of being friends and fosterers\r\nof education, these institutions have often been its worst foes. They\r\nhave served to transform ignorance into conceit, and make impossible true\r\nprogress on a substantial basis. Boom towns have started universities as\r\nan advertisement; local high schools are called colleges in order to\r\ngratify local pride, and college degrees have become a farce. Thus we\r\nhave in every Southern State colleges whose libraries contain less than\r\na hundred volumes, whose scientific apparatus could be hauled away in a\r\ncart and cost less than $100, and whose endowment is nothing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen Vanderbilt University opened its doors in 1875 it had no intention\r\nof receiving preparatory students; indeed, its first plan was to receive\r\nonly such students as had completed half of their college course. Hence,\r\npreparation was made for two college classes and two university classes.\r\nBut with the coming of the first class the ideals of the faculty were\r\nrudely shattered. A crowd of earnest but untrained students poured\r\ninto the college halls. A large number of the courses that had been\r\nprovided was found to be unsuitable and uncalled for, while there was an\r\nimperative demand for elementary classes in English, mathematics, Latin\r\nand Greek. In his report on the first year’s work Chancellor Garland\r\nstated that if the University had stood firmly by its rules it would\r\nhave rejected fully two-thirds of those who had presented themselves for\r\nmatriculation: “few had any power of fixed and prolonged attention or\r\nany practical knowledge of the modes of successful study.” In this way,\r\nthen, Vanderbilt University found itself compelled to begin preparatory\r\nclasses. These were continued for twelve years under protest. They were\r\nnot advertised, no effort was made to secure students for them, but there\r\nwere always enough candidates to make them a necessity. This continued\r\nuntil 1887 when they were finally abolished and the task of preparing\r\nstudents for the freshman class was boldly thrown upon the schools of\r\nTennessee and the South. The immediate result of this step was alarming.\r\nMany prospective students saw it was needless to apply for admission, and\r\nof those that did apply a large per cent had to be rejected. The number\r\nof literary students fell to 112 in 1889-90; only 29 students finished\r\nthe year in freshman English, and only 16 had been enrolled during the\r\nwhole year in freshman Greek. But slowly the situation began to improve;\r\nschools arose to do the work demanded by the University and the number of\r\nstudents surpassed even the totals of former years. Gradually, too, it\r\nwas seen that the University had not merely furthered its own interests,\r\nbut had been the means of building up a whole system of training schools,\r\nthereby directly influencing for good the educational development of\r\nTennessee and setting an example to the whole South. The results of this\r\nmovement are worthy of special consideration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the University would not have dared to make the experiment it did\r\nif it had not felt sure of at least one strong school on which entire\r\nreliance could be placed from the very beginning. This was the Webb\r\nSchool, which had then been in operation seventeen years and which had\r\nrecently been moved from Culleoka to Bell Buckle, Tenn. Shortly before\r\nVanderbilt University was founded Mr. W. R. Webb came to Tennessee from\r\nNorth Carolina to engage in school work. Educated at Bingham School and\r\nthe University of North Carolina, he had become familiar with the best\r\nmethods of school work and realized the great need of such work in the\r\nSouth at that time. The establishment of a university in close reach of\r\nhis school gave him an objective point for his labors, and his students\r\nwere very promptly turned in that direction. So successful was the\r\nCulleoka school, from the very beginning, that in a few years Mr. John\r\nWebb, a younger brother, was brought in as partner. It would be hard\r\nto overstate the value of the work of these two men for Tennessee and\r\nthe South. For thirty-five years they have labored, and have put their\r\nstamp for good on at least 2,500 Southern boys. Their patronage has come\r\nfrom every Southern State and the size of their school has been limited\r\nonly by the number they were willing to receive. Their old students\r\nare scattered over all the world. A year ago when this writer was in\r\nConstantinople without an acquaintance, as he supposed, within a thousand\r\nmiles, he was surprised to receive a call from the resident physician\r\nof Robert College, who was an old Webb boy, delighted at the chance of\r\nseeing some one he had known while at school. The Webb School has always\r\nbeen considered unique. Its buildings are plain and its furnishings are\r\nof the simplest kind. It has no scientific apparatus, for it is strictly\r\na classical school. But it has a good library, the doors of which stand\r\nopen winter and summer, day and night, and the books are used. Life is\r\nkeyed to a high tone in the schoolroom, and the boys feel it. Form counts\r\nfor little—perhaps too little—but substance counts for much. Professional\r\nstudents of pedagogy, visiting the school, go away surprised—and grieved,\r\nfor they do not find much respect shown their pet theories. The whole\r\nschool is wrapped up in the personality of the two men who have made it.\r\nSome of the Tennessee training schools could not have come into being or\r\ncould not now continue without the support of Vanderbilt University, but\r\nthe Webb School would have been a success under any circumstances. When\r\nthe surroundings at Culleoka did not seem to be suited at one time to the\r\nsuccess of school work, Messrs. Webb quietly informed the citizens that\r\nthey would move the school, and they did. The success of the Webb School,\r\nas well as the demands of Vanderbilt University, have made it easy for\r\nother schools to come into being.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Mooney School deserves mention next on our list. In 1886 Messrs.\r\nS. V. Wall and W. D. Mooney took charge of the school at Culleoka.\r\nAfter three years they removed to Franklin, Tenn., where they built up\r\nthe well-known Battleground Academy. About eight years ago Mr. Wall\r\nremoved to Honey Grove, Texas, where he still has a large school. Mr.\r\nMooney continued the work at Franklin. In 1902 his school building was\r\ndestroyed by fire, and he was induced to move to Murfreesboro, where\r\nhandsome grounds and buildings had been provided for his use at an\r\nexpense of about $30,000. The Mooney School has furnished many students\r\nto Vanderbilt University and they have frequently carried off the honors\r\nof the University for high scholarship. The Wallace University School was\r\nopened in Nashville, in 1886. The principal, Mr. C. B. Wallace, impressed\r\nhimself so strongly on his pupils and patrons that a building was soon\r\nerected for his use in order to fix his school at Nashville. The Wallace\r\nSchool has sent more pupils to Vanderbilt University within the past\r\nten years than any other school except Webb’s, and in proportion to its\r\nenrollment it is far ahead of any in University attendance. Fourteen of\r\nits graduates of June, 1904, entered Vanderbilt a few months later.\r\n\r\nBut it is necessary that our sketch proceed more rapidly. The popularity\r\nof the training school idea began to be manifest in many quarters. In\r\nMcKenzie there had been established an institution known as McTyeire\r\nCollege—a college doing the work for an academy. Later this was\r\ntransformed into McTyeire Institute, and Joshua H. Harrison, a Vanderbilt\r\ngraduate, was put in charge. At present this school has for its principal\r\nJames A. Robins and is growing in strength and influence every year.\r\nIn 1892 the Louisville Methodist Conference established the Vanderbilt\r\nTraining School at Elkton, Ky. This action was taken against the efforts\r\nof many who wanted a college, and is another proof of the recognition of\r\nsound educational values.\r\n\r\nQuite a large number of other schools can be enumerated that owe their\r\norigin more or less directly to the policy of Vanderbilt University.\r\nAmong these are the Branham and Hughes School, Spring Hill, Tenn.; the\r\nPeoples School, Franklin, Tenn.; the Morgan School, Fayetteville, Tenn.;\r\nthe Smyrna Fitting School, Smyrna, Tenn.; Pryor Institute, Jasper, Tenn.;\r\nUnion City Training School, Union City, Tenn.; Dresden Training School,\r\nDresden, Tenn.; McFerrin School, Martin, Tenn.; Howard Institute, Mt.\r\nPleasant, Tenn.; Jonesboro Training School, Jonesboro, Ark.; Fordyce\r\nTraining School, Fordyce, Ark.; Bridgeport Training School, Bridgeport,\r\nAla.; Luna Training School, Franklin, Ky.; Smith Grove Academy, Smith\r\nGrove, Ky.; Weatherford Training School, Weatherford, Texas; Hawkins\r\nSchool, Gallatin, Tenn.; Fitzgerald School, Trenton, Tenn.; Cornersville\r\nTraining School, Cornersville, Tenn.; Training School, Anniston, Ala.;\r\nBowen School, Nashville, Tenn.; Training School, Thomasville, Ala.;\r\nCulleoka Academy, Culleoka, Tenn. Not all of these schools have been\r\nequally successful; some of them, perhaps, have ceased to live, but\r\nthe training school idea is stronger to-day than ever before. In some\r\ncommunities this kind of work finds little support or encouragement.\r\nConsequently, no training school can live or succeed there. Honesty and\r\nthoroughness are the qualities that have marked Vanderbilt training\r\nschools, and some people wish neither of these in educational work.\r\nEducational shams and fake universities and colleges still command the\r\nadmiration and patronage of many.\r\n\r\nSpecial attention should be called to the Branham and Hughes School\r\nat Spring Hill, Tenn. Though one of the youngest, this is now the\r\nlargest and one of the most flourishing of the Tennessee training\r\nschools. Recently $15,000 has been spent for improvements of property.\r\nThe enrollment for the present year is 316, and nine teachers are\r\nemployed. The Peoples School at Franklin, Tenn., and the Morgan School\r\nat Fayetteville, Tenn., are also meeting with great success. Both of\r\nthese have strong local support, having been provided with splendid new\r\nbuildings, with dormitories and gymnasium; both have strong men at their\r\nhead and more than 200 students apiece.\r\n\r\nThe result of this movement is that Vanderbilt University now receives\r\na majority of its incoming class from the best schools in the South.\r\nIn the fall of 1903 seventy-five students entered the University from\r\nschools more or less directly affiliated with Vanderbilt and imbued\r\nwith Vanderbilt ideals. In September, 1904, four schools furnished the\r\nUniversity fifty students. Within the past ten years ten schools have\r\nfurnished the freshman class with more than five hundred students—that\r\nis, more than fifty every year.\r\n\r\nGreater still is the result that has been accomplished for the general\r\ncause of education. While the Webb School has furnished the University\r\nabout one hundred students in ten years, it has in that same time\r\nassisted in educating seven or eight hundred. Many of these did not\r\nfinish their course at school, some finished and attended other\r\nuniversities, more finished and went to work. But on all the influence\r\nof those years of earnest, thorough school work will be an incalculable\r\nbenefit. Similar is the record of all the other schools.\r\n\r\nStill another outgrowth of this movement has been that training schools,\r\nowing no allegiance to any particular university, have sprung up in many\r\npoints and are contributing largely to the intellectual development of\r\nour people. Excellent schools of this character may now be found in\r\nMemphis, Chattanooga, Atlanta, Birmingham, Montgomery, Mobile, and many\r\nsmall places.\r\n\r\nStimulated by Vanderbilt’s example, the Association of Colleges\r\nand Preparatory Schools of the Southern States has been formed,\r\nan organization that is devoting itself to the upbuilding of good\r\npreparatory schools, whether public or private, and the enforcement of a\r\nrespectable standard of admission to college.\r\n\r\nFinally, we may ask the question whether this work will be permanent.\r\nWill not these schools disappear before the advance of the public high\r\nschool? Perhaps so, to some extent, but never entirely. The public high\r\nschools have made great progress in Mississippi and Texas, stimulated by\r\nthe demands of the state universities, but elsewhere in the South their\r\nprogress is still slow. A recent article by Commissioner Harris gave a\r\nmost cheering account of the growth of public high schools in the South.\r\nIn that he records one hundred public high schools for Tennessee, with\r\nmore than 5,000 students. But the records of the Commissioner himself\r\nwill show that not as many students go to college from all this number as\r\nfrom half a dozen Vanderbilt training schools. In fact, one is forced\r\nto doubt the accuracy of many returns. For example, twenty-five of these\r\nhundred schools report a four year high school course; but only three\r\nyears are reported for the high schools at Nashville, Knoxville, Jackson,\r\nMurfreesboro, and Columbia. Only Chattanooga and Memphis, of the larger\r\ncities, claim to have a four year course. The twenty-three other superior\r\nhigh schools are in many of the most unexpected localities. White’s Store\r\nreports a four year course, with one teacher and twenty-five pupils;\r\nPiney Flats, a four year course, with one teacher and twenty-one pupils;\r\nDancyville, with one woman teacher and twenty-two pupils; Chuckey City,\r\nwith one woman teacher and six pupils. From statistics such as these it\r\nis dangerous to make hasty generalizations.\r\n\r\nLet the public high school come as rapidly as possible. Vanderbilt\r\nUniversity will be its friend and fosterer, as it has been in the city of\r\nNashville. But in any event it will ever remain true that a great work\r\nfor education has been accomplished in its relation to private secondary\r\nschools. It was truly said by President H. N. Snyder, of Wofford College,\r\nsome years ago; “If ever Vanderbilt University has had a mission, and has\r\nfulfilled it greatly and even gloriously, it is in the way it has helped\r\nto form what we understand as training or fitting schools.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            THE FOREIGN WIFE.\r\n\r\n                         By Claude M. Girardeau.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\nIt was the last of January, 1815. The harbor of the city of Charleston\r\nwas enveloped in a cold gray fog, that rose above the ramparts of the sea\r\nwall and advanced its phantom cohorts upon the houses facing the Battery,\r\ncapturing their outposts one by one, gradually submerging gable-end\r\nand piazza, surmounting tiled roof and overtopping chimney, until at\r\nnightfall the city, like a second Germe Ishausen, although resting upon\r\nthe surface of one ocean, was buried in the impalpable profundity of\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nInvisible to the eye, even at the distance of a few yards, the street\r\nlamps were mere ineffectual points of light in the dense and watery\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\nThe solid wooden shutters of the Battery houses were tightly battened so\r\nthat they presented an impenetrable front to the fog, which nevertheless\r\ninsinuated itself beneath threshold and window-sill and made its ghostly\r\npresence felt upon the very hearths where fires of pitch-pine and\r\nseasoned ash were lighted to dispel the dampness.\r\n\r\nAt the conjunction of the South and the East Battery, the mansion of\r\nGovernor Grantham occupied the right angle of the corner, its stone\r\nsteps encroaching upon the narrow sidewalk. Overhanging them, at the\r\nsecond story, the iron balcony bore upon the middle panel of its rail the\r\nentwined “G. G.” of the eldest son of the house of Grantham from time\r\nimmemorial.\r\n\r\nA visitor admitted beyond the front door would have found himself in\r\na dark and somewhat cramped hall, or entry, from the center of which\r\nmounted a flight of carefully waxed stairs, leading to an upper hall of\r\ndimensions more in keeping with the outward aspect of the building.\r\nTurning to the right and guiding one’s steps warily over its icy surface,\r\nconverted into a mirror by the daily brush of the slave, one would have\r\nbeen ushered into the drawing room, an apartment high of ceiling, scant\r\nof furniture, also slippery of floor, extending perhaps fifty feet along\r\nthe west side of the mansion. On this account it was easily convertible\r\ninto a ball room.\r\n\r\nAlthough it was half an hour since the conclusion of the last meal of\r\nthe day, this room was unoccupied—at least at first glance. Then in\r\nits extreme end appeared a pleasing tableau in the blazing firelight—a\r\ntableau that in the fifty feet of polished perspective might have been\r\nmistaken for an oil-painting by a master-hand for mural decoration.\r\n\r\nA divan of turquoise-blue damask had been rolled up to the chimney-piece\r\nand upon the soft white fur of an immense cloak thrown over one end of\r\nit, reclined a woman. Her white draperies were scarcely distinguishable\r\nagainst the fur, in which she sank luxuriously. Closer inspection would\r\nhave remarked the rise and fall of her bosom but partially concealed—one\r\nmight say almost entirely revealed—by the transparent material of\r\nher bodice; for she was attired _a la Grecque_, in an Indian muslin\r\nembroidered in silver lama, whose diaphanous skirt clung to her lower\r\nlimbs as the wet sheet clings to the sculptor’s model.\r\n\r\nThe short puffed sleeves of her Josephine waist left her beautiful arms\r\nentirely naked save for the cameo medallion in white and rose-color,\r\nset in thin gold, at her wrists. Her figure so openly displayed was\r\nof sufficient elegance to excuse the frankness, but beautiful as were\r\nits proportions, attentive admiration would have been first bestowed\r\nupon her face, oval, ivory-tinted, under a superb quantity of pale\r\nred hair confined by a classic fillet of gold with a pendant of pearl\r\nupon her white forehead. Her elongated eyes, half closed in reverie,\r\nwere apparently dark grey, with heavy lids whose lashes cast crescented\r\nshadows upon her cheeks.\r\n\r\nHer full, red lips were slightly open, disclosing the even edges of\r\nmilkwhite teeth, giving a luxurious, sensuous and somewhat cruel\r\nexpression to her vivid countenance. Her languid head leaned upon one\r\nfair hand, whose long fingers were embedded in the thick mass of hair,\r\nthe elbow supported by the curved shoulder of the divan. The other hand,\r\ndazzling with jewels, held in her lap an ivory-handled fan of flamingo\r\nfeathers, rose-colored like her cameos and the knot of velvet ribbon at\r\nthe depression between the soft elevations of her bosom.\r\n\r\nOccasionally she surveyed the foot resting upon the blue damasked\r\nhassock; it was slim and arched, encased in a heelless white satin\r\nslip-shoe which barely covered the toes and was strapped about the ankle\r\nand visibly halfway up the leg by narrow white ribbons. The flesh-colored\r\nstockings met skin-tight silk under-garments of the same hue, conveying\r\nthe impression of a body clad in a single dress, according to the fashion\r\nof the day for those whose perfection of figure permitted or excused it.\r\n\r\nWhen the contemplation of the foot lost interest, the young woman—for she\r\nwas hardly more than twenty-three—would draw from its hiding-place behind\r\nthe rose-colored velvet loveknot a medallion set in brilliants attached\r\nto a slender gold chain of exquisite workmanship, whose fine thread fell\r\nupon her delicate shoulders from the necklace of spinel rubies which\r\nembraced her swan’s throat like linked pomegranate seeds or tiny drops of\r\ntransparent blood.\r\n\r\nAn East Indian screen with numerous painted silk panels framed in ebony,\r\nstood in fantastic zigzags behind the divan, and the thick, blue-flowered\r\ndamask curtains of the shuttered casements had been carefully drawn;\r\nnevertheless she shivered now and then and pulled up about her arms her\r\nyellow scarf of Canton crepe heavy with silk embroidery and fringe.\r\n\r\nWax candelabra in silver-gilt were reflected from the paneled mirrors and\r\nin the shining floor of polished rosewood, pervading the apartment with a\r\nlight at once soft and lustrous.\r\n\r\nJust above the mantelpiece, dominating the entire _mise en scène_, hung\r\nan oil painting, a portrait by Copley of the master and mistress of the\r\nmansion. The lady in becoming a Grantham could not forget that she had\r\nbeen a Vizard, and therefore closely related to the last of the Royal\r\nGovernors of the Province.\r\n\r\nThe two figures were represented seated at a table engaged in a game of\r\nchess, the position of the pieces indicating a decided “check” on the\r\npart of the lady, whose haughty countenance appeared somewhat flushed\r\nwith anticipated victory.\r\n\r\nThe motive of the composition had evidently been at her suggestion, for\r\nher husband’s face expressed polite resignation either to superiority of\r\nskill or the triumph of accidental good fortune, giving him a position of\r\nsecondary importance more or less unmerited.\r\n\r\nHis daughter-in-law half asleep before the fire, glanced up at the\r\ntwo figures for the hundredth time and yawned as one—even a pretty\r\nwoman—yawns in the freedom of solitude: that is to say, open-mouthed.\r\n\r\nThe tap, tap of a cane came across the desert of waxed rosewood.\r\n\r\n“My dear Nadège, I sympathize most cordially with you,” said a voice at\r\nthe young woman’s elbow.\r\n\r\nNadège turned her ruddy head languidly and opened her sleepy grey eyes\r\nupon the fantastic figure before them.\r\n\r\n“Why do you sympathize with me, my dear cousin?” she inquired. Her\r\nEnglish was perfect, with, perhaps, a slight foreign precision rather\r\nthan accent.\r\n\r\nThe dear cousin sat down upon the divan beside her. She was an ancient\r\ndame whose much wrinkled face, surmounted by the mingled purple and\r\nyellow dyes of an extraordinary turban, was still alive with a pair of\r\nmalicious, sparkling black eyes. She grasped a tall cane at arm’s length\r\nin her skinny left hand, confronted the yawning beauty sharply, pressing\r\na pointed forefinger of her equally skinny right claw upon the middle of\r\nthe loveknot.\r\n\r\n“You were stretching your mouth in the very face of Madam and the\r\nGovernor. I saw you. It was done openly, without so much as the\r\ninterposition of fan or finger. How often have I done it myself!” She\r\nchuckled at the thought. “You are bitterly regretting that you ever left\r\nSt. Petersburg to bury yourself alive in this provincial capital of a\r\nrepublican colony. Is it not so, _ma chère_?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps you are right,” admitted the accused, “but it is only because\r\nGeoffrey is away. I declare, you people are so amusing.”\r\n\r\n“Amusing? Then why do you yawn at us?”\r\n\r\n“Ah! If I were only in Paris! How I hate the English.”\r\n\r\n“Sh!... Reflect! Madam Grantham is English” (with an upward glance of\r\ndeviltry), “the Governor, my cousin, is English, I am English, Geoffrey\r\nis English, you are—”\r\n\r\n“No, no! I am not. Not in the very least bone of me. That is why I find\r\nyou so amusing. You cherish English blood, you boast loudly of your\r\nEnglish connections, you cultivate English manners—which God knows thrive\r\nwithout much cultivation—! You emblazon your English coats of arms with\r\ntheir bastard French mottoes, on your carriage doors, your silver plate,\r\nyour slaves—”\r\n\r\n“One would think we branded them, to hear you,” interpolated the old\r\nlady, with amusement, “but go on—go on. Let us have the full extent of\r\nthe indictment.”\r\n\r\n“And where is Geoffrey now?” continued Geoffrey’s wife; “and where were\r\nthe Granthams in 1719, in 1749, in 1775? Why, fighting the English for\r\ndear life.”\r\n\r\n“That is more English than anything else,” retorted her cousin-in-law.\r\n“What would you have Geoffrey do? Stay at home?”\r\n\r\n“By no means. I encouraged him to go. But then I thought he would take me\r\nwith him since he was so absolute of victory.”\r\n\r\n“Take you with him? On board a privateer?”\r\n\r\n“There were other modes of transportation.”\r\n\r\n“My dear child! He could not be willing to have you exposed to danger.”\r\n\r\n“Ah!—so he said.”\r\n\r\n“Surely you do not blame him for that? Why do you not amuse yourself in\r\nhis absence?”\r\n\r\n“With whom, pray?”\r\n\r\n“If the gallants of the city could but hear you!”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps I would endeavor to find amusement in any other place than this.\r\nTruly I am dazed with ennui.”\r\n\r\n“I know, I know! I have not lived elsewhere myself for nothing. These\r\nridiculous provincials forget that the Nevsky Prospekt and the Boulevards\r\nwere ancient ways when King and Queen streets were Indian trails and the\r\nBattery a sandbank.”\r\n\r\nShe gazed into the glowing fire and fell into a retrospection; the path\r\nof memory led from the past to the present, so she said after a time:\r\n\r\n“I heard something to-day that may interest you.”\r\n\r\n“I thought there was scandal in the wag of your turban, and gossip in the\r\ntap of your cane.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, you did? Well, you are an impudent baggage, madam. This is neither\r\nthe one nor the other, yet, inasmuch as recounted to an indiscreet ear it\r\nmight cause both, I think I should not repeat it.”\r\n\r\n“I assure you, cousin, you may rely upon my discretion. Since Leonora’s\r\nabsence there is no one but yourself to talk to.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, madam, for the implication,” retorted the old lady, rising\r\nand executing an extraordinary courtesy with her most witchlike\r\nexpression, then sitting down again: “The Governor, my cousin, is of your\r\nmind. Poor man, he confides in me, and I would not betray his confidence.\r\nBut you are a foreigner—forgive the phrase, as it only means that you\r\nwill understand without being prejudiced—and I run no risk in telling\r\nyou what he said to me. It was more to ease his mind than to obtain\r\nadvice; for which I was properly grateful, as I had only sympathy and not\r\ncounsel in the simples of my pharmacy.”\r\n\r\nWhile she discoursed in this illustrative strain the listener said to\r\nherself:\r\n\r\n“Lord, will she never come to the point? What a garrulous old parroquet.”\r\n\r\nThen aloud:\r\n\r\n“Your introduction is perfumed with interest. I am more curious to hear\r\nthan ever. What has happened, or is going to happen, that excites your\r\nsympathy, or would justify advice? (I will let her see that I can turn an\r\nEnglish period as glibly as herself!)”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, to be brief, Mistress Geoffrey, Captain Grantham is coming\r\nhome. Hence the arrival, post-haste, of the Governor at a time that\r\naffairs of state should have detained him in the capital.”\r\n\r\n“_Captain_ Grantham? Who is he?”\r\n\r\n“A well-known officer in the French army. A personal friend of Prince\r\nEugène de Beauharnais.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes; I saw him once in Paris. A very young man at that time. But\r\nhandsome, gallant and dashing. Altogether the _Frenchman_.”\r\n\r\n“Geoffrey should hear you,” replied the old lady dryly. The other laughed:\r\n\r\n“Seeing that Geoffrey is an officer in the American navy I do not think\r\nhe would have any fault to find with my eulogy of French gallantry. I am\r\nrejoiced to hear that this flower of chivalry is coming home. Now that\r\nthe Bourbons are in power again I suppose he finds his occupation gone.”\r\n\r\nBut Miss Anne was looking into the fire, the ghost of a smile puckering\r\nher bloodless lips disagreeably.\r\n\r\n“You might be rejoiced to hear it in Paris or Petersburg, but not in this\r\nplace; no, not in this place.”\r\n\r\n“You are right, I daresay. In Charleston I have discovered that a\r\nbrother-in-law is a blood relation, not a flimsy connection by marriage.\r\nFlirtation with one is therefore robbed of all its venom—of all its\r\nfascination, also. Still, as I remember Captain Grantham—”\r\n\r\n“This is not the one you remember.”\r\n\r\n“You said Geoffrey’s brother?”\r\n\r\n“_Sans doute_! But Reginald’s brother also.”\r\n\r\n“Reginald’s brother? You speak in riddles; you have just said it was\r\nReginald’s self. Is he not Captain Grantham?”\r\n\r\n“No; I should have said his _alter ego_. Reginald is now _Colonel_ of\r\nartillery.”\r\n\r\n“Another Grantham!”\r\n\r\n“Truly; and about the same age.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, a twin.”\r\n\r\n“By no means. You saw one brother in Paris, but I do not think you saw\r\nthe other. Yet, very likely you did; they are, I am told, wonderfully\r\nalike. They were at the Ecole Militaire together. The relationship is\r\nunmistakable except to those who will not see.”\r\n\r\nThe old gossip laughed aloud, enjoying the other’s mystification.\r\n\r\n“What singularity!” exclaimed Nadège. “Pray go on. I am no longer bored.\r\nI can even regard this portrait without a yawn. Who is this Captain\r\nGrantham? And why should I not know him here or see him in Paris? You\r\ntell me he is famous and the companion of princes.”\r\n\r\n“He has a name of his own. It is descriptive and picturesque, besides\r\nbeing symbolic.”\r\n\r\n“Ah? Pray pronounce it.”\r\n\r\n“Brugnon.”\r\n\r\n“What then? Where is the symbolism?”\r\n\r\n“Well, then, this Monsieur Brugnon is like his brothers Reginald,\r\nGarrick, and Geoffrey in all respects save one; unfortunately, the most\r\nimportant one of all.”\r\n\r\n“What is it? Why have I been kept in ignorance of this, since it is\r\nevidently a family affair? What is this difference of such vital\r\nimportance?”\r\n\r\n“His color.”\r\n\r\nMistress Geoffrey sank back into her furry nest, her expression of lively\r\ncuriosity and irritation instantly effaced by one of bland indifference.\r\n\r\n“I see. Why does he not remain in Europe? He is a fool to come here.”\r\n\r\n“So he is,—but he does not know it. He wrote to his father, the\r\nGovernor, your father-in-law and my cousin, to say that since the\r\nabdication of the Emperor and the enforced residence of Prince Eugène\r\nin Vienna, he revolts from the service of a _lackey at court_ after the\r\nactivity of the battlefield, and now desires to _see his own people_ once\r\nmore and his home—the home of his childhood, the plantation, the other\r\n_Court_ hardly less celebrated than—”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I know,” exclaimed Nadège hastily, “named for the English\r\nestate of the Granthams near Twickenham, Middlesex, which contains\r\n‘fourteen hundred acres of land, and gardens, fishponds, hedges, terraces\r\nand fountains unsurpassed by anything in the South.’ My memory, you see,\r\nis excellent.”\r\n\r\n“You have been reading the family annals of late?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no; it was not necessary! Tell me, cousin, is this _petite histoire_\r\ngenerally known?”\r\n\r\n“Yes: the Governor was much censured for sending the boy to France, and\r\nhis rapid promotion has been a sore on the foot of those who will tread\r\nhim in the very mire when he comes to see _his own people_, poor devil.”\r\n\r\n“Why does the Governor permit his return?”\r\n\r\n“He cannot help it. Brugnon wrote that he would take ship at once.”\r\n\r\n“Who is his mother?” was the next question.\r\n\r\n“Ah, who knows?” And Miss Ann peaked up her sharp shoulders under their\r\ngay flowered silk covering and wagged her oriental headgear until the\r\nfiligree silver ornaments in the lobes of her large ears jingled audibly.\r\n\r\n“I think I could guess,” she added, with a wizened smile at her\r\ncompanion, “but what difference? Society here, my dear Nadège, as you\r\nhave already discovered, is in the hands of the men. We women are the\r\nvases on the mantelpiece.” She grinned in Mistress Geoffrey’s face: “Some\r\nof us are particularly decorative. Mistress Grantham, for example.”\r\n\r\nThe younger woman eyed meditatively the sharp yellow face under the\r\nresplendent turban.\r\n\r\n“One has a good view from the mantelpiece,” she began, when a young man\r\nentered the room and advanced to the fireplace.\r\n\r\n                          [_To be continued._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           WHEN NELLIE SMILES.\r\n\r\n                            By D’Arcy Moore.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  When Nellie smiles across at me,\r\n                  She’s well worth coming miles to see.\r\n                  Deep dented dimples find a place,\r\n                  Best suited for their added grace,\r\n                  The one on either side her face,\r\n                    Dan Cupid capers high in glee\r\n                        When Nellie smiles.\r\n\r\n                  When Nellie smiles, dear girl, at me,\r\n                  Her blue eyes twinkle roguishly;\r\n                  She bows her dainty head the whiles\r\n                  (She’s mistress, past, of woman’s wiles)\r\n                  And thus the willing wretch beguiles.\r\n                    Ah! surely there is witchery\r\n                        When Nellie smiles.\r\n\r\n                  L’Envoi:\r\n\r\n                  If you would keep your peace of mind,\r\n                  So often wrecked by woman-kind,\r\n                  Be warned in time.

Born in Mississippi in 1870, he is now, at the age of\r\nthirty-five, head of the Department of Chemistry in the College of the\r\nCity of New York. After his graduation at the University of Virginia,\r\nhe spent some time studying in Germany, and was called upon his return\r\nto the University of North Carolina, where he occupied the chair of\r\nchemistry. He is the author of a text-book on chemistry, and has written\r\nnumerous articles on scientific, educational and technological subjects.\r\nHe has distinguished himself in the field of original research and\r\nexperiment, and belongs of right to the select band of scientific men who\r\nin these latter days, are so eagerly bringing to the light the laws that\r\ngovern phenomena in the wonderful world of Nature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe world to the human interpreter appears as a paradox of complexes.\r\nScientific progress, during late years, has not been along the lines of\r\nthe least resistance. One who has to do with the problems of nature is\r\nfascinated by the difficulties. Lord Rayleigh attached this motto to his\r\nrecently issued, but already famous, “Collected Papers:”\r\n\r\n  “The works of the Lord are great\r\n  Sought out of all them that have pleasure therein.”\r\n\r\nTo be sure, the gratification of overcoming obstacles is often the only\r\ncompensation.\r\n\r\nScience has a wide range in the size and nature of the things with which\r\nit deals. With the microscope, it enlarges for vision the unseen world of\r\nbacterial life; with the telescope it draws the celestial bodies near and\r\ninterrogates them with the spectroscope; it drags the lifeless element\r\nfrom the inanimate world, curiously plays with it and then puts it to\r\nman’s use, while seeking his origin and forcing him ever to show cause\r\nfor his existence and right to question.\r\n\r\nMuch of the very recent work in physical science has distinct leanings\r\ntowards metaphysics. It is scarcely to be wondered at, when the\r\nexperimental data obtained appear to question tenets which devotees\r\nhave become accustomed to regard as immutable. Facts are stubborn,\r\nhowever. When they cause the giving away of the least portion of the\r\nboundaries of our cherished systems, the imagination is unchained. The\r\ndiscovery and development of our knowledge of the wonderful phenomena\r\nof radio-activity, about which much that is true and more that is false\r\nhave appeared in reputable journals of a not remote date, ensample the\r\ngroping of our restlessness. These marvels, according to those who have\r\nworked with them most and whose opinions deserve the first consideration,\r\nspontaneously and continuously give out energy appreciable to the senses.\r\n\r\nWhere does this energy come from? Where does it go? One mudsill of\r\nscience is the law of the conservation of energy. This division of\r\nscience has a host of investigators busy with the problem of sustaining\r\nthis fundamental. The harvest, which is not all grain but contains some\r\ntares, indicates that substances, which we have been pleased to regard\r\nas elemental constituents of nature, undergo voluntary alterations. Some\r\nappear to be breaking down into simpler matter, while others are building\r\nup. This virtually carries us back to the days of the alchemist.\r\n\r\nIt is a long story, which may not be related here, the deep-seated belief\r\nof most chemists in the unity, hence transmutation, of the elements. It\r\nis a far cry to its accomplishment, however. We need not go back to the\r\ntime of the black-art for other examples of efforts to transform one\r\nelement into another. Victor Meyer sought to build up thallium shortly\r\nafter Crookes found it. Winkler dissipated Fittica’s transformation of\r\nphosphorus to arsenic. So chemists will be busy asking questions of\r\nRamsay’s formation of a body like lead, through the agency of penetrating\r\nrays of radium.\r\n\r\nAnother foundation stone of science is the law of the conservation\r\nof matter. J. J. Thompson, from experimental work, explains certain\r\nobservations by the existence of substances called electrons, a thousand\r\ntimes smaller than hydrogen, which we have regarded the lightest chemical\r\nelement. The electrons appear to carry an electric charge. One farther\r\nstep is then taken by the Cambridge professor, who says these corpuscles\r\nare electricity. They are attenuated matter. Electricity is a form of\r\nenergy. We need no law for the conservation of the matter. Ostwald has\r\ntaught that when one struck his shin on a chair in the dark, it was not\r\nthe solid wood, but the force involved which produced the sensation. One\r\nwould not have been conscious of the existence of the obstacle, but for\r\nthe energy. Matter is energy.\r\n\r\nHere one is on the boundary lines of experimental science and dealing\r\nwith a metaphysical problem. It must not be forgotten, however, that two\r\nhundred years ago any suggestion of the Röntgen rays could well have been\r\nplaced in a similar category.\r\n\r\nWhether the explanations be accepted or not, it may be noted that\r\nLodge has already illustrated, by beautiful lecture experiments, the\r\npossibility of a practical utilization of the facts of some of the\r\nobservations. Fog is easily dissipated through the agency of electricity.\r\nThe application of the principle on a gigantic scale, to a city like\r\nLondon, may yet be realized.\r\n\r\nThere are in the world, as is well known, numerous organisms belonging\r\nto the vegetable kingdom that do not resemble at all any of those things\r\nwe are accustomed to look upon as plants. These bacteria are extremely\r\nsmall. They are from .00002 to .00004 inch in diameter. They are studied,\r\nnot by ordinary vision, but by means of microscopes and by microscopes\r\nof only the very best kinds. They are, also, studied by their effects.\r\nThey propagate very rapidly. Starting with one organism they may grow,\r\nwithin twenty-four hours, to 281,470,000,000 individuals. This rapidity\r\nof growth does not actually take place in nature; it is checked through\r\nnatural conditions, or through excretions of the organism inhibiting such\r\npropagation.\r\n\r\nWe hear a great deal as to the production of virulent diseases through\r\nthe agency of bacteria; but, while there are evil bacteria, there are,\r\nalso, bacteria that are good. In short, we may understand, that all\r\ngood bacteria are not dead bacteria. These bacteria exist in very large\r\nnumbers in the soil. The upper portion of rich garden soil may contain,\r\non an average, from one to five millions per cubic centimetre. This\r\nnumber may be very much greater, depending upon the amount of decomposed\r\nmatter that is present and the favorable conditions for their propagation.\r\n\r\nWe are accustomed to think of bacteria as living only on the richest food\r\nand being the cause solely of putrefaction. This is not true. There are\r\nbacteria that live on the bare rocks and get their sustenance from those\r\nrocks and the surrounding air. Under these conditions they actually store\r\nup food material. They are really miracle workers. They render the soil\r\nfertile and the farmer is largely dependent upon them for the growth of\r\nhis crops. They reduce mineral substance to the powdered form, assist in\r\nstoring up organic matter for the soil and thus render it suitable for\r\nthe growth of higher plants.\r\n\r\nUnder the influence of sunlight the green portions of plants, by\r\nabsorbing carbon dioxide from the air and water from the soil, produce\r\nstarch, which is one of the important foods for animals. This is not\r\nthe work of bacteria, yet some of these organisms are capable of\r\naccomplishing similar work in the dark. It has been suggested that they\r\nderive their energy directly from the oxidizing processes that they set\r\nup. This is one of the problems of the soil bacteriologist.\r\n\r\nMany micro-organisms act upon nitrogenous matters and destroy them, in\r\nthat the substances are rendered less available for higher plants. These\r\nare denitrifying agents. There is another class of these micro-organisms,\r\nhowever, that takes nitrogenous food, which is only a little or not at\r\nall utilized by higher vegetables, and makes it available plant food.\r\nThese micro-organisms thus contribute to the fertility of the soil. They\r\noxidize ammonium compounds, from whatever sources they may be had, and\r\nform nitrites first and then nitrates. The nitrates are used by common\r\nplants. The nitrifying bacteria are composed of two groups of active\r\nagents: one group serves to make the first change, namely from ammonium\r\ncompounds to nitrites; and the other, to change the nitrites to nitrates.\r\nThe conditions most favorable for their activity are just the opposite\r\nfor most other micro-organisms. In a soil having much organic matter\r\nalready decomposed, these bacteria may be practically inactive until\r\nthe decomposition has passed certain stages. During this transition,\r\nthe soil is barely suited for crops. Nitrification requires the oxygen\r\nof the air; denitrification can go on in a compact soil with the least\r\nportion of the atmosphere. So really the soil is cultivated largely to\r\nfavor the growth and propagation of the nitrifying bacteria. The result\r\nof experimentation has shown that this may be facilitated in some cases\r\nby denitrification first, and in other cases by stirring the soil for\r\nthe penetration of the air, and again by applying lime to the soil to\r\novercome the acidity. Professor Burrill recently said, “Some day farmers\r\nwill come to understand that specialists working in the laboratory, and\r\nfor years gazing through microscopes, are gaining knowledge for them.”\r\n\r\nWhile many bacteria do not necessarily render food available for plants,\r\nthey are most valuable in putting useless matters out of the way. One of\r\nthe absolutely essential chemical elements for the growth of plants is\r\nnitrogen. It is most expensive. It is present in the greatest unavailable\r\nabundance, constituting three-fourths by weight of our entire atmosphere,\r\nand it is, also, the one element most likely to be deficient in the soil.\r\nIt constitutes an essential constituent of albumenoid material. Under the\r\ninfluence of the denitrifying bacteria, it is converted into ammonium\r\ncompounds, which are converted then through the nitrifying agents into\r\nnitrates. The nitrates are extremely soluble in water; consequently,\r\nthere is no tendency towards the accumulation of the valuable food\r\nmatter in the soil, as the same is leached out. The growing green plant\r\nis surrounded by the food that it wants but, as with the Ancient Mariner,\r\nthere is not a drop to drink. Green vegetation cannot, or only to a\r\nlimited extent can, absorb and utilize directly the free nitrogen of the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nAs a result of a long series of experiments, it has been learned that\r\nthere grow excrescences, somewhat similar to galls, on the roots of\r\ncertain plants. These natural structures have a character peculiar to the\r\nspecies of plants on which they occur. In a manner not understood, these\r\ntubercles, inhabited by bacteria, are capable of securing sufficient\r\nnitrogen from the air for their own growth, when the soil is practically\r\nable to furnish none. Other plants, next door, without these nodules,\r\nwill die of starvation.\r\n\r\nThe number of bacteria in these nodules is very great but, although\r\ncountless, they are insignificant compared with those in the soil\r\noutside. Those within the nodules, however, are specifically different\r\nfrom those without, perform different functions, and appear to be\r\ncharacteristic of the particular plant in which they exist. The\r\nleguminous plants, as peas, beans, clover, have these peculiar nodules.\r\nOther plants, however, like maize, cotton, wheat, are devoid of these\r\nassistants.\r\n\r\nIt has been known for a long time that the fertility of the soil could\r\nbe augmented by rotating the crops and thus adding nitrogen to the soil\r\nby means of these leguminous plants. One of the problems engaging the\r\nattention of scientific agriculturists at present is to learn whether or\r\nnot these leguminous organisms may be made to form tubercles on other\r\nplants, as for example corn or wheat. The importance of the successful\r\nissue of such experimentation requires no emphasis. While successful\r\nresults have not yet been reported, something has been learned: namely,\r\nthe fruit of corn may be very much modified in its chemical composition\r\nby breeding. Grain very much richer in nitrogenous matter has been grown\r\nby changes in the breeding. Such grain is a better food.\r\n\r\nThis is indeed a day of almost excessive specialization in science: Great\r\nthings have been accomplished by the intense method. Some have thought,\r\nand spoken their thoughts, that such tended to carry men of science away\r\nfrom the contemplation of a unit or the system as a whole. Not a few\r\nhave argued, perhaps with reason, that the great generalizations, as for\r\nexample Darwin’s theory of evolution, were no longer to be hoped for. It\r\nis impossible for any single brain to follow the details of the varied\r\nbranches of science. It is rare that one man pretends to know the detail\r\nof that division of science to which he gives attention. It is equally\r\ntrue, however, that many systematic minds are gathering, collating and\r\npublishing in readable form accurate summaries of details in the several\r\nbranches. Men of broader vision are gathering these authentic digests and\r\noffering concepts, which encompass the phenomena of the Universe.\r\n\r\nSuch have been hinted at as the efforts of some to do away with what we\r\nhave been pleased to term axiomatic truths. Whether this be desirable,\r\nis really of no moment. The facts point to the present movement of\r\nefforts to simplify matters. The most beautiful things after all are the\r\nsimplest. This idea, of course, should not convey the impression of being\r\nboldly plain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      “THE MESSAGE OF THE VIOLET.”\r\n\r\n                               By G. D. G.\r\n\r\n\r\nDown the long corridor swept the theater-goers, men in the sober black\r\nand white of evening clothes, women in the brightest of theater gowns.\r\nDebutantes paused to chat with college men as they found their way to\r\nboxes and orchestra chairs; bachelors stopped to talk of the affairs of\r\nthe day before taking their places in the front rows. The old playhouse\r\nwas fast filling, for it was “The Princess of Tyrolia” that night.\r\n\r\nWith the first notes of the orchestra a young man hurried down the aisle\r\nand dropped into a seat far back in the shadow of the balcony. His eyes\r\nswept hastily over the audience and then became fixed on a box near the\r\nstage.\r\n\r\n“I knew she would be here,” he murmured softly; “she could never keep\r\naway from this music.”\r\n\r\nIt was a pretty picture he found to gaze upon and it was little wonder\r\nthat he looked but seldom at the stage. More attractive even than the\r\nrows of gorgeously dressed girls in the chorus was that box near the\r\nstage. Seated toward the front was a young girl, just rounding into the\r\nbeauty of the woman—while retaining all the freshness of girlhood. Behind\r\nher laughed and chatted a few companions of her own age, but she kept her\r\neyes fixed upon the stage and seemed to fairly revel in the beauty of the\r\nringing chorus. To her the music seemed everything, and the great bunch\r\nof violets in her hand was beating unconscious time to the march.\r\n\r\nFar back in the shadow the boy, for he was little more, leaned forward\r\nand watched the rapidly changing expression on her face. He followed\r\nthe action of the play only through the varying moods which found a\r\nreflection in her eyes. Many times had he watched her thus, haunting the\r\ntheaters only to sit unobserved and gaze longingly at her every moment\r\nthat he could, then slipping quietly away before the curtain dropped to\r\navoid meeting her in the throng. Never once, in all the long months, had\r\ntheir eyes met, and if she had been conscious of his presence she had\r\ngiven no sign.\r\n\r\n“It has been a long time,” he muttered, moving restlessly in his seat.\r\n“What a fool a man can be when there is a woman in the case.”\r\n\r\nHe had met her only the summer before, a summer filled with little\r\nexcursions to nearby resorts where city folk threw off the burden of\r\nformality in the jolly little dances and moonlight strolls. How it all\r\ncame back to him now—the open pavilion with the negro musicians, the\r\nrapturous waltzes and the swinging two-steps and the long talk on the\r\nbroad veranda afterward, talk of nothing of great importance but which\r\nnow seemed to him to be worth years away from her.\r\n\r\nThen had followed the autumn and the return to the city. The long\r\nevenings at her home, where the soft glow of the candles behind a crimson\r\nshade had lent a new beauty to her clearly moulded features. She had\r\nloved the soft light of the candles as she had loved the moonlight.\r\nIt had seemed that everything about her had breathed of softness and\r\nquiet. Changing moods she had shown—he had often called her his “Maid of\r\ninfinite variety,” but each new mood had given her a new attraction in\r\nhis eyes; every new phase of her character had brought her closer to him.\r\n\r\nIt all passed in rapid review before him. Now he sat in the old lawn\r\nswing beside her, now he turned her music as she sang the old songs they\r\nboth loved. He remembered the good-byes at the gate and the long walk to\r\nthe city afterward. There had never been cigars with so sweet a flavor as\r\nthose which kept him company on the long way home. Just the moonlight and\r\nthe blue smoke and thoughts of her.\r\n\r\nBut it had ended at last. Only a misunderstanding which caused a growing\r\ncoldness and then a sudden interruption of his dream. He had been too\r\nproud to ask but once for an explanation—she was as proud as he. It had\r\nbeen months since the two had met—months when the city seemed to be as\r\nlonely as only a great city can.\r\n\r\n“It’s hard,” he muttered, and though his lips kept their stern, almost\r\ndefiant expression, his eyes had a half appealing look as they rested\r\nupon the girl in the box.\r\n\r\nAs the music broke into a new strain the girl leaned suddenly forward in\r\nher chair and her face showed a new interest. Then her eyes dropped and\r\nshe seemed to be in a deep study. It was “The Message of the Violet” now,\r\nand as the lovers on the stage began the song the audience was hushed\r\ninto silence. Over the footlights came the strains, mellow, vibrant,\r\ncharging the very air with the smell of violets and of spring. The girl\r\nsaw instead of the picture on the stage a vision of a summer night, a\r\nquiet corner on the old veranda. The music floated toward them while the\r\ndancers swept over the floor and he was repeating to her the story of his\r\nlove. She had listened half in joy, half in fright, and tears had mingled\r\nwith smiles before a bevy of laughing girls had called them back to the\r\ndance.\r\n\r\nThe song ended and a great burst of applause awoke the girl from her\r\nreverie. Her eyes turned instinctively toward the audience and far back\r\nin the shadow she saw him, his eyes half covered with his hand. Over her\r\nswept a new feeling, a sudden resolve. She fingered the violets on her\r\nlap as the song rose once more into the chorus:\r\n\r\n  “I love you, love you, love you,\r\n  And my heart’s true blue.”\r\n\r\nThe young man felt a tap on his shoulder. A boyish usher was dropping a\r\ntiny bunch of violets into his hand.\r\n\r\n“From the young lady in the third box,” he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                          WHOSE TEMPLE YE ARE.\r\n\r\n                         BY ISABELLA HOWE FISK.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    In the quarry of its earthly life,\r\n                    Works the soul.\r\n                    Though it suffer toil and strife,\r\n                    Thy control\r\n                    Canst hew out the rough material\r\n                    For a master-builder’s plan;\r\n                    And the soul shall rise ethereal\r\n                    From the structure of the man.\r\n                    In beneath the granite arches\r\n                    Swings the spirit’s censer fair,\r\n                    And amid the ritual arches\r\n                    Incense rises through the air.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                          Lyrical and Satirical\r\n\r\n                         CONDUCTED BY VERMOUTH.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             WHAT’S THE USE?\r\n\r\n                        (A Rhyme of Spring Fever)\r\n\r\n          There’s so much to do and there’s so little time,—\r\n                      What’s the use?\r\n          There’s so much that’s prosy and so little rhyme,—\r\n                      What’s the use?\r\n          The fishing is fine and you can’t get away,\r\n          And you have to sleep night time instead of by day,\r\n          And when you feel gloomy you’ve got to be gay.—\r\n                      What’s the use?\r\n\r\n          Most folks are stupid and very few true,\r\n                      What’s the use?\r\n          If the evenings are purple, next mornings are blue,—\r\n                      What’s the use?\r\n          If mentally strong you are morally weak,\r\n          And you never attain what you most fondly seek;\r\n          You choose a companion and find him a freak,—\r\n                      What’s the use?\r\n\r\n          The good are as bad as the wicked are pure,—\r\n                      What’s the use?\r\n          The famous unhealthy, the saintly obscure,—\r\n                      What’s the use?\r\n          And when you have passed through the dark vale of tears,\r\n          And St. Peter enjoins you to cast off your fears,\r\n          You’ve got to sing hymns for some six million years,—\r\n                      What’s the use?\r\n\r\n\r\n                          AN INTERESTING PLOT.\r\n\r\nThe rumored threat of President Castro of Venezuela to overrun and lay\r\nwaste this fair land of ours is not creating the popular interest that\r\nsuch a dread announcement might be supposed to arouse. Possibly public\r\nsentiment is not entirely convinced that His Presidency would act the\r\nbully merely because it is in his power to do so. So far only a single\r\nelement has exhibited jingo propensities, but there is no telling how\r\nfar it may go to embroil the nation in a sanguinary entanglement that\r\ncould have but one possible termination. The lone disturbing element in\r\nquestion consists of a party of intrepid soldiers-of-fortune fictionists,\r\ncomic opera librettists, pure humorists and promotors of high-class\r\nvaudeville who are keen to feel the possibilities of so much rich\r\nmaterial being imported to their very doors. Richard Harding Davis is\r\nreported to be mobilizing a bunch of bold buccaneers, ably assisted by\r\nMr. Dooley, George Ade, Dinkelspiel, O. Henry and other intrepid spirits,\r\nto meet the incoming hosts and apply for syndicate privileges. That the\r\nsituation demands finesse and diplomacy, however, is obvious, for all\r\nwould be lost should some irreverent band of roving cowboys round up and\r\nrope the outfit before they could get at it, or should some thoughtless\r\nand lacking-in-humor police squad run amuck and confine the layout in\r\nsome local bastile. The amusement loving public might be expected to at\r\nleast stand between this patriotic movement and such a dread contingency.\r\n\r\nThe following may be reasonably conceived as the final preparation\r\nfor the impending invasion: President Castro: “Are the choruses well\r\ndrilled and are the comedians and soubrettes in good voice?” Leader of\r\nthe Orchestra: “Si, Senor.” President Cas.: “Are the costumes new and\r\nup-to-date, and is scenery in good order and packed for shipment?”\r\nMaster of Properties: “Si, Senor.” President Cas.: “Has the vanguard\r\nof press agents and bill posters taken the field?” Booking Agent: “A\r\nmost formidable array, your Augustness.” President Cas.: “Then on the\r\nroad! And may your performances prove so meritorious that you will carry\r\neverything before you till you reach the great Metropolis itself. This\r\nfeat your proud people expect you to accomplish in time for the fall\r\nopenings.” After which labored and patriotic outburst the president lit a\r\ncigarette and called for a demi-tasse with which to restore his depleted\r\nenergies.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               HARD LUCK.\r\n\r\nIt was his sixtieth birthday and in times agone he had fondly anticipated\r\nthe arrival of that occasion as marking a happy fruition of his talents\r\nand a mature mellowing of his energies. Instead, however, he found\r\nhimself summoned to appear before the public executioner with the family\r\nBible and prove its records false or be humanely extinguished in the\r\ninterest of modern enlightenment. “This is too hard,” he murmured, “but\r\nit would be infamous as well as futile to question the authority of\r\nthe Good Book, and besides I am too young to die. Though I appreciate\r\ntheoretically the demands of civilization, as a practical proposition the\r\nidea has its limitations.”\r\n\r\nIt was with difficulty that he was enabled to restrain a tear when he\r\nthought of the young wife whom he had taken unto himself just prior\r\nto the enactment of the regulation for the removal of the innocuously\r\nobsolete, and whom he now felt that he had procured under false\r\npretences. His pessimistic misgivings were accentuated by a picture of\r\nher after he had gone to his reward striving for sustenance wherewith\r\nto nurture the innocent infant cooing at her breast. But every remedy\r\nwas exhausted. The President had declined to interpose with as much as\r\na temporary respite, regretting his painful obligation but tactfully\r\nreminding him of the majesty of the law, the interests of society and\r\nthe demands of the strenuous life. In due season he was led face to face\r\nwith the public chloroformer, who humanely inquired of him if he had\r\naught to observe by way of valedictory. Not anticipating such courteous\r\nconsideration, he was temporarily abashed, but recovering his dormant\r\nspeech, feebly but feelingly observed: “Only a single request. When I\r\nshall have yielded up and taken flight to that somber realm whence no\r\ntraveler has as yet returned, spare my modest memory from the obituary\r\nparagrapher, who would chronicle the lamented departure from our midst\r\nof another consistent church member and well beloved citizen.” Saying\r\nwhich he inhaled deeply and peacefully passed into the big slumber while\r\nhis fair young wife adopted the proud profession of a laundress and his\r\ninnocent babe was carefully safe-guarded in a local institution for the\r\nhomeless progeny of those who had they been permitted to ramble at large\r\nwould have been “only in the way.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                          WHY NOT BE SENSIBLE?\r\n\r\nIt is not to be presumed that in the present age of popular enlightenment\r\npeople do not know better than to trifle with germs. It is, therefore,\r\nalarming to note that with light they will continue to practically commit\r\nsuicide by a failure to observe the most ordinary rules of hygiene. In\r\nthe mad pursuit of pelf and position little heed is being given to the\r\nomnipresence of bacilli, bacteria and other mischievous, pernicious and\r\nfatal agencies. Why will people supinely continue to court death in\r\nstreet cars, theaters, churches and at crowded entertainments, where the\r\nmost casual movement sets into motion myriads of germs that are inhaled,\r\neaten and absorbed by those present? And why will they disregard common\r\ncaution by eating food in hotels, cafés, restaurants, Pullman cars and at\r\nhome, when all food is known to be gorged with murderous molecules of one\r\nsort or another? And why perpetuate the dangerous habit of washing when\r\nboth soap and water are teeming with baleful bacteria? There are still a\r\nfew who continue to take water into their system in full realization that\r\nit contains something more than a million germs per drop. And is there\r\nno way of impressing the public with the fatal consequence of sleeping\r\nin beds and sitting in chairs, and of riding and walking through streets\r\nsurrounded by air which is composed largely of corrosive sublimate—a\r\ndeadly poison? And as for kissing? Only Igorrote, Hottentots and Russians\r\ncan be forgiven for not knowing better. So deathly does modern research\r\nrecognize this primitive and all but obsolete practice to be, that it\r\nis being seriously considered of adoption as a pleasing and more humane\r\nsubstitute for chloroform as an antique exterminator. Why not conform\r\nto the simple necessities and observe the rational precaution of doing\r\nnothing without first being sterilized and aerated? And let those\r\ndetermined to drink remember to recognize as sanitary only those fluids\r\ncommonly known to be strongly germicidal. It would seem that the present\r\ngeneration will never reach a true realization of its peril until it has\r\nalready become extinct.\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE NORTHERN VIEWPOINT.\r\n\r\n                      His heart went out in feeling\r\n                      To the colored brother kneeling\r\n                          At the white man’s feet;\r\n                      His brother’s wrongs oppressed him\r\n                      And a poem he addressed him,\r\n                          Warm and neat.\r\n\r\n                      He suffered indignation,\r\n                      He swore by all creation\r\n                          ’Twas a crime,\r\n                      To deny him social right—\r\n                      Wasn’t black as good as white\r\n                          Every time?\r\n\r\n                      By the way, in this connection\r\n                      He’s now visiting this section,—\r\n                          He finds the matter clear—\r\n                      And without aid or suggestion\r\n                      He has come to view the question\r\n                          As one of atmosphere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                                EDITORIAL\r\n\r\n\r\n                           FRENZIED POLITICS.\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of men in politics who are the very salt of the\r\nearth.

It is the mysterious art of political\r\nhoodoo, which works shady miracles in every theater of government, from\r\nthe county courthouse to the national capitol.\r\n\r\nThe jugglers of this art slip into conventions, caucuses and legislative\r\nhalls, and whisper a magic word, and lo! in the twinkling of an eye,\r\nmajorities are changed to minorities, and minorities to majorities; oft\r\nexpressed opinions and deep rooted convictions upon vital principles\r\nand policies of government are reversed in an hour, and the enchanted\r\nfloating solons, forgetting old hickory shirt and copperas breeches at\r\nhome, forgetting the men with cheeks of tan who walk in the furrow,\r\nforgetting the sturdy toilers at the anvil, the workbench and the drill,\r\nlosing sight of the confiding multitudes who but yesterday twined the\r\nlaurel wreath of honor about their brows,—fall down upon their faces\r\nbefore the golden Combine, in that sacred temple of free government which\r\nis dedicated to righteousness and the liberty of the people, crying with\r\na loud voice both night and day, “Great is Diana of the Ephesians!” That\r\nwhispered word, so full of the music and the dream, is “Pie.” O, wondrous\r\nword of marvelous power! O, sweet and juicy symbol of perfect happiness.\r\nO, ravishing synonym of golden eagles and the goddess of liberty! In\r\nit are reflected the bewildering glories of a thousand heavens of pure\r\ndelight; golden slippers and laurel wreaths to burn; heaving seas of\r\n“sour mash” whose amber surfs forever break on fragrant shores of mint;\r\nsweet journeys on Pullman palaces of rosewood and mahogany to the land\r\nof the orange and the palm. In it are the stolen fires of the stars,\r\nflashing in diamond shirt studs, and the crimson glow of sunset skies\r\nimprisoned in rubies set in gold on lily white hands that will toil again\r\nnever more. In it are visions of mansions in spreading groves where the\r\nwicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest. Is it any wonder,\r\nthen, that opinions so suddenly change and promises and pledges so\r\nswiftly dissolve into a puff of wind and leave not a rack behind? Is it\r\nany wonder that Samson is shorn of his locks while yet he slumbers, and\r\nonly wakes to find his window up, his strength and piety gone and his\r\nbreeches pockets turned wrongside out? Is it any wonder that when, at\r\nlast, the Rip Van Winkle of Public Confidence rises up from his trance\r\nhe finds only the skeleton of Fidelity at his feet and the gunstock of\r\nsafety rotted away from the rusted barrel of sovereignty by his side?\r\nAnd is it any wonder that he exclaims, in the language of old Rip of the\r\nAdirondacks, “Am I so soon forgot?” Is it any wonder that the bewildered\r\nCommonwealth, like poor old Rip, so often looks around, and failing to\r\nrecognize the little pile of bones near by, asks with tearful eyes, “Vare\r\niss mine leetle dog Schneider?”\r\n\r\n  But what doth great Diana care\r\n  For Samson when he’s lost his hair?\r\n  The tears are vain that Rip doth shed:\r\n  He slept too long, his dog is dead.\r\n  So states are shorn, and nations weep,\r\n  For crime committed while they sleep.\r\n\r\nScheming lobbyists of mighty combines juggle together and whisper into\r\nthe listening ears of shrewd politicians, “You’ve got the power and we’ve\r\ngot the pie. We are willing to swap pie for power. What _we_ want is\r\nlegislation or no legislation, as our interests may require. What _you_\r\nwant is _office_.” Then the politicians juggle and honey fuggle the\r\nfloating vote, and there is a mighty shuffling of political cards and\r\nsoon they all join hands behind closed doors and the soft whisper passes\r\nround the ring, “We are one and inseparable for power and for pie; we are\r\nthe flowers that bloom in the spring, tra, la! Let the word be mum.” Then\r\nfollows the secret banquet of bargain and intrigue under the very dome of\r\nliberty. It is quite exclusive, even more so than a banquet of the four\r\nhundred in the great metropolis. Old Copperas Breeches is not invited nor\r\nBrother Hickory Shirt, nor Dr. Honesty, nor ’Squire Patriotism, nor any\r\nof the old folks at home. There is no room around the festive board for\r\nProfessor Pedagogue, of Purity High School, nor Deacon Righteousness, of\r\nChurchville. The public welfare is lost in the shuffle. After a short\r\nblessing is whispered by the Rev. Judasio Iscarriotis, the sumptuous\r\nfeast begins, the menu consisting alone of pie: senatorial pie, sweetened\r\nwith ring syrup; gubernatorial mince pie, flavored with moonshine;\r\nspeakership pie, highly seasoned with the sunshine of spicy promises\r\nof favors to come; clerkship pie, dripping with the honey of fat and\r\nsucculent salaries; and on down, to a little half moon dried apple pie of\r\na free pass to oblivion.\r\n\r\n  They clink their merry glasses,\r\n    Now hear them softly sing—\r\n  “The people are all asses,\r\n    Diana’s in the swing!”\r\n  And after the feast is over,\r\n    After the pie is gone,\r\n  The combines are in clover,\r\n    As we go marching on.\r\n\r\nThen the band begins to play, and the elephant moves around, bearing on\r\nhis spacious back the anointed high priests of Pie and Power, followed by\r\na great procession of worshipers, and heralded by a flourish of trumpets\r\nin the hands of the jugglers, who alternately blow and shout, crying out,\r\nas with one voice, “Great is Diana of the Ephesians, who hath the world\r\nby the tail and a down-hill pull! Clear the way for the most high priest\r\nof power! Clear the way for the priestly priest of Pie! Hail, all hail!!”\r\n\r\nThus the dismal tale of history runs; hopes of free government are\r\ncrushed; dreams of liberty are shattered; blind Samson nurses his wrath\r\nuntil his shorn locks grow out again; and then, with giant strength and\r\ninsane rage, he lays hold of the pillars of the temple,\r\n\r\n  And with a crash republics fall,\r\n  Down go liberty, combines and all.\r\n\r\nThis is the shady side of politics. But the burnished crest of the\r\ndarkest cloud reflects in golden arcs the splendors of the sun, and the\r\nangels of hope hang a rainbow on its bosom. All power is inherent in the\r\npeople, and there are patriotism and courage enough in their bosoms to\r\nweather the storms that rise dark o’er the way, if they do not get lost\r\nin the Adirondacks of Prosperity and drink from the jug of indifference\r\nand sleep too long on their rights.\r\n\r\nCombined capital is digging its own grave when it becomes the Diana of\r\nmodern machine politics. And combined Labor is driving the nails in its\r\nown coffin when the spirit of anarchy directs its blows for the redress\r\nof its grievances. Until recently the South has maintained its integrity\r\nand its immunity from the hoodoo art of machine politics; but the methods\r\nof destruction have found their way into Southern capitols, and, unless\r\nSamson wakes, he will soon find himself utterly powerless to use his\r\nfavorite jaw-bone, or any other kind of a weapon, on the Philistine\r\ncombines who are plotting against him in the temple.\r\n\r\nGod speed the day when Capital and Labor shall combine under the banner\r\nof arbitration and of peace, and when the battle cry of the Republic\r\nshall be, “Equal and exact justice to all, with special favors to one.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                        A TALE OF A LECTURE TOUR.\r\n\r\nI entered the car, threw my grip between two seats and sat down by a\r\ndrummer. He looked at my valise and then at me and dryly asked, “Are\r\nyou a traveling man?” “Yes,” was my reply. “What is your line?” asked\r\nhe. “_Sweetened wind_,” quoth I. A smile lighted his face as he quickly\r\nasked, “Preacher or lecturer?” And then there was a laugh and a lull.\r\n\r\nAfter an all day’s travel which wore me into a frazzle, I reached my\r\ndestination at 8.30 P.M. It was a cold, drizzling evening. The skies\r\nwere leaking spray, and in the language of Mrs. Partington, the street\r\nwas a perfect “lullaby” of soft and sticky mud. The little freckle-faced\r\ndreamer who had bought me for a hundred and fifty caught me by the arm\r\nwith one hand as I stepped off the cars and seized my grip with the other\r\nand literally pushed me head foremost into a Jim Crow hack drawn by one\r\nold spavined horse,\r\n\r\n  With one eye out and t’other blind,\r\n  He racked before and paced behind,\r\n\r\nuntil we reached the hall where I was to lecture. I found a little cold\r\nand shivering crowd seated there, waiting to be warmed by my eloquence,\r\nand without a chance to make my toilet and don my little “swallow tail,”\r\nI was ushered on the stage and introduced as the greatest orator,\r\nphilosopher, poet, musician, statesman, scientist, actor and artist that\r\never came down the pike, whereupon I began to shake my jaw and pour out\r\nmy metaphors; but somehow or other my eagle wouldn’t soar that night. He\r\nflopped his cold and flabby wings and rose and fell for an hour and a\r\nquarter. The audience departed like mourners from a funeral; but one good\r\nold lady lingered in the hall till I came off the stage and in her pity\r\nshe sidled up to me and whispered, “I liked your little talk right well.”\r\nI found the freckled-face dreamer waiting at the door, and, cold as it\r\nwas, the sweat was rolling down his cheeks. His face was the picture of\r\ndespair when he handed me a hundred dollar bill and ten fives. I knew\r\nthat his castle in the air had fallen. “How did you come out?” I asked.\r\n“Well, Governor,” he said, with a tremulous voice, “I’m out just eighteen\r\ndollars.” I took the roll he had given me out of my pocket and skinned\r\noff four bills in the light of the lamp dimly burning and said, “There\r\nare twenty dollars, my boy, and my blessing upon you.” He almost shouted\r\nand pressed my hand continuously as we walked through the mud to the\r\nlittle hotel on the starvation plan. Then there were a brief sleep and an\r\neasy conscience. I crossed the Father of Waters in triumph next morning\r\nand tarried in Memphis till the next train out. I went to the bank to buy\r\nNew York exchange, took out my roll and lo! I had given old freckle-face\r\nthe one hundred dollar bill and three fives. Then again there was a laugh\r\nand a lull—he laughed and I lulled. I pocketed my laugh and my loss\r\nand climbed into the pouch of a Southern Kangaroo on wheels and with\r\na single hop I cleared the state of Mississippi and lit in Alabama. I\r\nclimbed out and got into the ’bus in a beautiful little town among the\r\nblushing hills. Before I had washed the dust of travel from my brow, a\r\nspider-legged dude, with ambrosial locks curled and parted in the middle,\r\ncame strutting like a clean-shaven and musk-scented dream into the dingy\r\nand time-honored little room where my valise and I were safely deposited,\r\nand with Chesterfieldian bow and a fluted voice announced that he had\r\nbeen designated by the ladies to introduce me that night to the audience.\r\nHe shook his curls and said, “Governor, I have never delivered a speech\r\nin my life, but I have been at work on this one for about two weeks; and\r\npardon me for saying that I think she’s a daisy.”\r\n\r\n“Well, my friend,” I said, “I am fond of daisies.” With another shake\r\nof his locks he said, “The society people are all coming out to-night\r\nto hear me introduce you.” I shook my scanty locks and said, “I am glad\r\nthere is something bringing them out.”\r\n\r\nThe clock struck 8. An elegant carriage stopped at the hotel door where\r\nI was waiting, and the sweet-scented dream in full evening dress,\r\nemerged, and gently took me by the arm and ushered me into it. We went\r\nwhirling to the stage entrance of the theater, but as we walked up the\r\nstairs I observed that he tottered like a man ascending the gallows and\r\nhis lips were colorless and quivering. We took our seats side by side\r\nbehind the curtain. I motioned to the curtain man that all was ready,\r\nand with a whiz and a bang the curtain went up, and, sure enough, there\r\nin front of us, in the brilliantly lighted auditorium, was a breathing\r\nbouquet of youth and beauty and old age which greeted us with a storm of\r\napplause—the society folks had indeed come out to hear him introduce me.\r\nI nudged my friend and said, “Shoot.” He never budged. I nudged him again\r\nand said, “Go ahead!” He never budged. I looked around and his face was\r\nas white as a sheet and great drops of perspiration like beads of pearl\r\nwere standing on his pallid brow. I said again, “Go ahead!” and in his\r\nagony he mumbled with muffled voice, “Governor, she’s gone.” There was\r\na lull and a laugh, and in about two seconds he was gone. Before I had\r\ndelivered half my sweetened goods I observed a number of yawns and stolen\r\nglances at watches and increasing signs that my crowd wanted to go. There\r\nis no anguish like that which a lecturer feels when his listless audience\r\nturns to frost and nips all his flowers of speech. The saddest spectacle\r\nin all the tide of time is a frost-bitten orator. He gathers up his\r\nlittle withered tropes and similes and vanishes, and all that saves him\r\nfrom suicide is the dream that he will blossom again in a more congenial\r\ngarden. I collected my tribute money in the Alabama town and mounted a\r\ngrasshopper train and went hopping and stridulating from rail to rail\r\nuntil I found a patch of clover in a rich and aristocratic Georgia town\r\nwhere I lounged and exchanged anecdotes with traveling men and with\r\nthe natives until the lights were turned on and I stood all robed in\r\nmy “swallow tail,” in the midst of as delightful an audience as ever\r\nlistened to a sap-sucker speech or laughed at the unwinding of my little\r\nball of yarns. A tall and handsome Georgia lawyer rose to introduce me\r\nand thus he spake:\r\n\r\n“Ladies and Gentlemen: I have traveled a great deal in my life and on\r\none of my journeys I took in the mountains of East Tennessee. I paused\r\nin that peculiar country to study the customs of that peculiar people.\r\nThey make maple sugar in East Tennessee. They have great sugar orchards\r\nthere, and one of the customs of the people is to tap the sugar trees\r\nin the spring when the sap begins to rise and they give the children in\r\nthe family a tin cup and turn them out into the sugar orchard and never\r\nsee them any more for six weeks. I have the pleasure to introduce to you\r\nto-night a sap-sucker from East Tennessee!”\r\n\r\n  There was a lull and a laugh,\r\n    And the sap began to run,\r\n  And they kindly took a quaff\r\n    From my sugar-trough of fun.\r\n\r\nI settled with the secretary of the treasury and mounted a March hare\r\ntrain and sped away through many a cotton patch, from town to town, out\r\nof Georgia into the Old North State, and, flanking Charlotte, squatted at\r\nthe State University at Chapel Hill, that classic spot of earth so rich\r\nwith memories of the glorious past and still teeming with joyous student\r\nlife, like those who have gone before, dreaming of the glorious future.\r\nThere I met Dr. Battle, that grand old man who has fought a thousand\r\nbattles for enlightenment and human happiness. There I met Alphonso\r\nSmith, one of the South’s foremost young men in the field of educational\r\nendeavor and whose soul is in tune with Southern progress and Southern\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThere, too, I met Eben Alexander, a brilliant star from the sky of\r\nTennessee, shedding the soft light of Grecian literature upon the\r\nyouthful brain of Carolina. I met a score of other stars in the faculty\r\nof this great University. I stood on the platform of its splendid\r\nauditorium and tossed bouquets at as refined and cultured an audience as\r\never sipped sap from a sugar tree. And when I packed my grip and started\r\nSouthward I could not repress the sweet old song:\r\n\r\n  “Hurrah! hurrah! for the Old North State forever!\r\n  Hurrah! hurrah! for the good Old North State!”\r\n\r\nFinally, I landed in Charleston, South Carolina, where I played\r\nBeauregard, but instead of firing bomb shells at Ft. Sumter, I fired\r\nsoap bubbles at the heads and hearts of a magnificent audience of\r\nrepresentative Charlestonians; and whether I pleased them or not, they\r\nwere so generous and hospitable as to flatter me with occasional bombs of\r\nlaughter and a few volleys of applause.\r\n\r\nI swung back through Alabama to my home in Nashville, on hearing the\r\nnews that the political sap was rising; but, alas! only to find that the\r\nTennessee sugar tree was already tapped, you see, and that the senatorial\r\nsugar-trough was full of sap-suckers holding a snap caucus, and there was\r\na lull and a laugh—I lulled and they laughed. When I awoke from my lull\r\nI kissed my wife and children good-bye, and broke for Texas, the queenly\r\nyoung sister of Tennessee, who took me in her arms, and brushing away my\r\npolitical tears, pressed me to her loving heart.\r\n\r\nThere is no state in the Union that gives a Tennesseean a warmer welcome\r\nthan Texas, because her lap is full of Tennesseeans, and, moreover, she\r\nis naturally hospitable and kind. There is a place on her fat knee for\r\nevery troubled soul, a kiss of sunshine on her lips and a lump of sugar\r\nin her hand for every weeping wanderer.\r\n\r\nO, glorious empire state of the sun-kissed South, with thy hundred and\r\nseventy-five thousand square miles of as rich a country as was ever\r\ntickled by the plow or the pick, and as ever laughed a harvest of cotton\r\nand grain for the comfort and happiness of man! With thy cattle on a\r\nthousand hills, thy countless flocks, thy gushing wells of oil, thy\r\nfields of rice and sugar cane stretching far away like the sweet fields\r\nof Eden on the other side of Jordan! With thy fatness thou canst feed\r\nand warm the world! I wonder why the poor huddle in the smoke and filth\r\nof crowded cities when Texas smiles and beckons them to her landscapes\r\nof beauty, where the prairie flowers bloom and the sunshine plays with\r\nthe zephyrs from the Gulf and sometimes scuffles with a cyclone. I\r\nwonder why toiling millions dwell amid blackened walls only to be slaves\r\nto heartless masters, when untouched fields invite the happy home and\r\nvirgin soil still waits for the plowman and his merry song. I wonder why\r\nhelpless children are doomed to die by thousands in polluted hovels and\r\ncrowded alleys, when the green meadows of Texas bid them come and chase\r\nthe butterflies among the bluebells and the daisies, and the blossoming\r\nhills call them hither to romp and play where the happy birds sing and\r\nthe cows come home in the evening fragrant with the breath of alfalfa and\r\nthe sweet wild grasses of the plains. Texas is a Paradise for the poor,\r\nit is a third heaven for the rich.\r\n\r\nBut I am about to forget that I was talking about my lecture tour. Let me\r\nsee!—O, yes!—“All aboard for Nashville!” the conductor cries. Well, the\r\nrest of my story I will tell around the happy hearthstone of home.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            FOOLISH DREAMERS.\r\n\r\nIt is a marvelous truth that this golden era of the world’s history has\r\ninspired no great poets that rank with Byron and Burns and Tom Moore and\r\na long list of other immortals who have enriched literature with their\r\nsongs; and it has developed but few prose writers worthy to wear the\r\nmantles of Blackstone and Kent in law, of Gibbon and Macaulay in history,\r\nand Scott and Bulwer in romance and fiction.\r\n\r\nIt is well we call it the golden era, for it is an era of commercialism,\r\nwhen men are trampling literature and art and music under their feet\r\nin the mad rush for gold and the gilded glory that it buys. To be a\r\nmillionaire is greater in the estimation of modern worshipers of mammon\r\nthan to be a Goldsmith; and a multimillionaire is greater in their\r\ngold-jaundiced eyes than a William Shakespeare. The highest aspiration of\r\nthese nervous and strenuous generations is the acquirement and hoarding\r\nof gold. Religion is tinged with it. Politics is its ally—and alloy\r\nin the ratio of sixteen of gold to one of Patriotism. And most of the\r\nbusiness and social relations of this enlightened age are purely golden\r\nand measured only by the circumference of a dollar. The English poet\r\nsounded the keynote of true philosophy when he sang:\r\n\r\n  “Ill fares the land to hastening ills a prey\r\n  Where wealth accumulates and men decay.”\r\n\r\nThe true wealth of a nation rests not so much on bricks of gold as upon\r\ngolden thought—the riches of brain and heart—the treasures of truth and\r\nthe pure and beautiful sentiments of life. In the wild scramble for\r\nsordid gain and the golden reins of power in these wing-footed days of\r\navarice and materialism, the angels of happiness no longer beckon from\r\nthe landscape and the stream nor call from the sweet solitudes of the\r\nforest; but they stand tip-toe on the burnished domes and glittering\r\ntowers of the city and the town, with crowns of gold in their hands. And\r\nthe brain and brawn of the land gather there from the hills and hollows\r\nto climb after them on a thousand ladders of dreams. But the environments\r\nof domes and towers, while they stimulate the brain to grasp great\r\nfinancial problems and to weave the web of glory around the thrones of\r\nmoney kings, contract the nobler and better ideals and impulses of the\r\nheart to the gilded forms of artificial pleasure.\r\n\r\nDid you ever watch a bevy of city swells and society belles swinging and\r\nwhirling under flaming chandeliers until the coat-tails of the swells\r\npopped like whip crackers and the skirts of the belles flapped like the\r\nsails of a schooner in a high wind? That was a piping gale of pleasure in\r\nhigh life in the town. Did you ever attend a great reception in the heart\r\nof the metropolis? It was a gorgeous scene of icicles and spectacles,\r\nof broadcloth, and jewels arrayed in white slippers and costly gowns\r\nof richest colors; and the icicles and spectacles bowed to the jewels,\r\nand the jewels bowed to the icicles and spectacles and they held sweet\r\nconverse on the subject of their bicycles and tricycles and various and\r\nsundry articles and drank champagne and sherry and all got very merry and\r\nwound up with oysters and dill pickles. And then the tipsy icicles and\r\nspectacles got in their elegant vehicles and went home with the jewels in\r\nthe morning. That was the cream of urban civilization. Did you ever gaze\r\non a gaudy throng of bald-headed Apollos and painted Minervas walling\r\ntheir eyes in speechless rapture before the garish lights of the grand\r\nopera? How the fans and ribbons fluttered and the side-whiskers swayed\r\nand spluttered amid the inscrutable harmonies of Wagner! That was the\r\ntuneless pandemonium of urban music. Did you ever watch the bulls and\r\nbears of finance turn the stock exchange into a howling wilderness of\r\nconfusion in the struggle to raise or lower prices? That was the third\r\nheaven of artificial pleasure and excitement in the city.\r\n\r\nBut what is a thrill of victory in the gambling hell of frenzied finance\r\ncompared with the joy a fisherman feels down on the farm when a game\r\ntrout strikes his baited hook in the darkening eddy of a crystal stream\r\nand the good reel sings as he gives him line and the fishing rod bends\r\nand the waters splash? What is the gilded club room where the wizards of\r\nfinance meet to sip and smoke and shuffle the cards of fortune compared\r\nwith a fisherman’s tent and a fisherman’s luck on the bank of a moonlit\r\nriver where hearts are trumps and souls overflow with song and story?\r\n\r\nDid you ever hear the tale of Mark Antony, the funeral orator of Rome\r\nand the Romeo of the Nile? He went angling in Egypt one day on the royal\r\nbarge with the beautiful Cleopatra and he fished and fished and fished,\r\nunrewarded by a nibble, until the hours grew dull and heavy. But the\r\ncunning queen conceived a plan to change her lover’s luck and unfolded\r\nthe scheme to a slave; and the slave secretly dived from the larboard\r\nside of the boat and hung a dried herring on the General’s hook and then\r\ngave his line a vigorous pull. “By Jupiter!” shouted Mark Antony, “I have\r\nhooked a monstrous fish.” “Take care, my lord, and give him line lest\r\nhe drag thee into the sea,” cried the dark-eyed queen, as she chuckled\r\nbehind her fan.\r\n\r\n“By the gods! that fish shall flounder on thy deck, or I shall flounder\r\nbeneath the waves!” cried the impetuous Roman. He squared himself and\r\ngave a mighty jerk, but fell sprawling on his back at the feet of the\r\nlaughing queen, and when he looked up and saw nothing but a little dried\r\nherring dangling among the ropes above him, he blandly smiled and dryly\r\nsaid: “He was a monstrous fish while biting, but between his bite and my\r\njerk, he has wonderfully shriveled. But he’s the oldest looking fish and\r\nhas the loudest smell of any that ever perfumed the royal barge.”\r\n\r\nAnd so many an ambitious Antony sits in the stock exchange of the\r\ngreat city and drops his hook in the sea of speculation, and he fishes\r\nand fishes with his little wad of hard earned cash, until some shrewd\r\nmanipulator, just to change his luck, takes the little wad off and gives\r\nthe line a heavy pull, and when our guileless Antony thinks he has hooked\r\na million, he jerks and falls at the feet of fickle fortune, and finds\r\ndangling in the air above him only the dried herring of a shrivelled\r\nhope, and there is nothing left but the aged look of an empty purse and\r\nthe smell of a dream that is vanished!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                              LEISURE HOURS\r\n\r\n          For Conference Between the Magazine and its Readers.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen The Taylor Publishing Company made its announcement of the\r\nforthcoming appearance of BOB TAYLOR’S MAGAZINE, its statements were\r\nreceived with interest by all, with enthusiastic approval by many and\r\nwith predictions of disaster by sundry Jeremiahs and Thomases. For the\r\nlast named class the fact that a Southern magazine had not succeeded,\r\nthough many had been projected, was sufficient reason for the conclusion\r\nthat none could succeed, and possible success versus probable failure was\r\ndiscussed throughout the length and breadth of the land.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Governor Robert L. Taylor and his co-laborers in the\r\nenterprise, imbued with a belief in the feasibility of the venture,\r\nwith the idea of the vital necessity to the people of the South of a\r\nliterary periodical which might adequately and fittingly represent the\r\nliterary life and customs and romance and ideals of the South, and with\r\nan indomitable intention of firmly establishing such a useful vehicle of\r\nthought and expression, proceeded with their organization. Literature in\r\nregard to BOB TAYLOR’S MAGAZINE was prepared, a campaign of publicity\r\nwas inaugurated, articles and stories were secured for the first number,\r\npaper was bought, and an issue of 10,000 copies was determined upon, as\r\namply sufficient for the first number.\r\n\r\nBut herein the projectors of the enterprise underestimated the demands of\r\ntheir friends. No sooner was the prospectus issued which indicated the\r\ncharacter of the magazine and gave a partial list of the contents of the\r\nfirst number, than the mails were congested with correspondence; agents\r\nwere appointed by the hundred; subscriptions poured in; and it was\r\ndecided to print 15,000 copies instead of 10,000 copies.\r\n\r\nThe size of the magazine, too, grew rapidly in the hands of the staff,\r\nuntil, instead of the 116 pages originally planned, it was found\r\ndesirable to give 164 pages. This was rendered necessary, in part, by the\r\nlarge amount of advertising secured; and this is one of the best indexes\r\nof the faith of the people in the success of BOB TAYLOR’S MAGAZINE.\r\nHard-headed men of business do not give up their money for mere sentiment\r\nor out of compliment to even so eminent and widely loved a man as\r\nGovernor Taylor. No. They look upon BOB TAYLOR’S MAGAZINE as a valuable\r\nadvertising medium—and they are right.\r\n\r\nAt last, on the 21st of March, the eagerly awaited magazine appeared,\r\nand far surpassed the most sanguine expectations of its readers. In the\r\nintrinsic merit of its articles, stories and departments, in its dainty\r\nand appropriate cover, in its numerous and handsome illustrations, in its\r\nexcellent typography and press-work, and equally in its well displayed\r\nand interesting advertisements it fully satisfied the most critical. The\r\nrealization of a literary magazine worthy of the South was apparent.\r\n\r\nAnd yet the Jeremiahs, silenced as to the initial number, muttered _sotto\r\nvoce_: “Well, you can’t do it again.” Nevertheless, the present number\r\nbears internal evidence that we have “done it again.” And we shall “do\r\nit” every time. This we promise. We shall no longer pay heed to that\r\n(fortunately small) class which experiences a melancholy pleasure in\r\nmaking direful predictions.\r\n\r\nThe avidity with which the first number of BOB TAYLOR’S MAGAZINE was\r\ngreeted was astounding even to the editor-in-chief and his staff,\r\nnotwithstanding the thousands of encouraging letters, the enormous influx\r\nof subscriptions, even before a type had been set, and the fact that the\r\ninterest was not confined to the South but was manifested with especial\r\nearnestness by the people of the North. Letters of congratulation by the\r\nbushel, and complimentary editorials, reviews and press notices have told\r\nthe tale from Androscoggin to San Jose. Space, of course, precludes the\r\nreproduction of them here, even if it were desirable, but the following\r\nselection from a letter of the senior member of one of the largest\r\nadvertising agencies in the United States is so significant that it is\r\nfelt that its insertion will be pardoned:\r\n\r\n“I thought it was hardly possible there could be a place for another\r\nmagazine, and consequently took little interest in your first\r\nannouncements. When your first number came to hand, however, I was so\r\nattracted by the dainty cover showing the ‘fiddle’ with which the name\r\nof Bob Taylor is so intimately associated in the minds of those who know\r\nanything of the South, and especially of Tennessee, that I carried it\r\nhome last night, and did not lay it aside until every word in it by Bob\r\nTaylor had been read and several of the articles re-read.\r\n\r\n“Heartiest congratulations on the merit of the first number, the\r\ncharacter of which, if maintained in succeeding numbers, will surely make\r\na place for this new apostle of sunshine.\r\n\r\n“Only give us more of Bob Taylor, if possible. Why not let him have a\r\npage between each other article each number may contain. Why restrict\r\nhim to a department or departments? John Brisben Walker wrote the entire\r\nSeptember, 1904, _Cosmopolitan_ unaided. It is believed Bob Taylor could\r\nwrite an entire number without any assistance if he would make up his\r\nmind to do so, and it would be certain to prove a hummer.”\r\n\r\nFifteen thousand copies is a large number for the first issue of any\r\nmagazine; yet they were exhausted within one week after the magazine\r\ncame from the press, and thousands of copies have since been ordered by\r\nagents and dealers, while an ever increasing army of new subscribers\r\ndemand, like so many Oliver Twists, with vehemence and iteration—MORE,\r\nMORE. _And yet every copy is sold!_\r\n\r\nIt is a situation that pleases while it embarrasses, and it gives the\r\nvaluable pointer that we must provide larger issues, which we shall do,\r\nthat no one may miss a single number.\r\n\r\nConsidering these facts, so briefly outlined, we would not be human\r\nwere we not elated and happy and thankful. And yet we have not, we\r\ntrust, been spoiled by lavish praise, but rather spurred on to greater\r\nefforts to measure up to our opportunities, to the expectations of the\r\nSouthern people, and to our mission to exploit the virtues, resources and\r\ncapabilities of this section, while bringing every month more sunshine\r\nand happiness into the heart of every reader of BOB TAYLOR’S MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the information of new subscribers we repeat that we invite, for\r\ninsertion in this department, communications on all subjects of unusual\r\ninterest and importance, such as\r\n\r\nProse and poetry of sentiment, fact and fancy.\r\n\r\nForgotten or unpublished bits of history and tradition.\r\n\r\nAnecdotes of famous men and women, and of quaint and curious occurrences.\r\n\r\nThe best short stories and tales you have heard or read, if unusual or\r\nunfamiliar.\r\n\r\nSuggestions for the special benefit of BOB TAYLOR’S MAGAZINE—how it may\r\nbe improved, what it should contain, what it should admit.\r\n\r\n\r\n           Industrial Energy and Enterprise of the Old South.\r\n\r\nThere is little danger that the glories and beauties of the Old South,\r\nas reflected in its social life and ideals, will be forgotten in the\r\nindustrial progress and prosperity of the New, for these things have\r\nbeen made immortal by the sure touch of tradition and literature, but\r\nthere is another phase of the old regime well worth our pride and\r\nattention, which seems to have well nigh faded out of popular impression\r\nand consideration. We refer to the industrial and commercial activity\r\nachieved by the South before the war, of which the general idea takes so\r\nsmall and disparaging account. It is tacitly assumed and loosely declared\r\nthat previous to 1860 the South lived in ease and sloth upon slave-labor\r\nand the cotton crop, paying no heed to manufactures or industrial\r\ndevelopment, and that before the wonderful business progress of the last\r\ndecade commercial enterprise and ability were unknown qualities in this\r\nsection. There were heroes before Agamemnon, however, and the truth is\r\nthat long before the New South existed in phrase or fact, the Old South\r\nwas holding its own in wealth-producing industries with other sections of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nIn a pamphlet, published some years ago, Mr. Richard H. Edmonds,\r\nof Baltimore, first drew attention to these facts, and in so doing\r\nperformed a unique and important service to historic truth, no less\r\nthan to sectional pride. “Facts about the South” is the title of Mr.\r\nEdmond’s brochure and he prefaces his summary of present prosperity\r\nand prophecy of future development by a somewhat novel presentation of\r\nSouthern industrial conditions previous to 1860. He boldly challenges\r\nthe assumption that the South during that period was not fully abreast\r\nof the times in all business interests and quotes indubitable statistics\r\nand historic records to prove his case. In the decade between 1850 and\r\n1860 the growth in Southern railroad and manufacturing interests was\r\nespecially marked, the government reports showing a greater percentage of\r\ngain in the South than in New England and the Middle States, or, indeed,\r\nthe whole country at large. Moreover, the popular idea crediting the Old\r\nSouth with producing only cotton, rice and sugar, is clearly disproved by\r\nMr. Edmonds, who gives the figures of Southern crop production for 1860,\r\nshowing a condition of agricultural diversity and prosperity unsurpassed\r\nin any part of the country.\r\n\r\nThis vigorous protest against a prevailing delusion should be read in its\r\nentirety by every Southerner who, as he reads of the thrift and energy\r\nof the Old South, will be inspired with a firmer faith in the growth and\r\nstrength of the New, recognizing in the industrial development of to-day,\r\nas Mr. Edmonds expresses it, “not a novel creation” in this section, but\r\n“the result of evolution.”\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n  MR. EDITOR:\r\n\r\n  After all the flowery speeches and kind words that have been\r\n  showered upon BOB TAYLOR’S MAGAZINE, all of which I heartily\r\n  endorse, I am afraid you will not appreciate what I am going\r\n  to say, but I’ll say it, nevertheless; it will be as good as a\r\n  corrective; too much sweets are always cloying.\r\n\r\n  I have read the magazine through from cover to cover, even to\r\n  the advertisements, and found everything good, better, best, yet\r\n  I was disappointed and will tell you why. There was no smallest\r\n  fraction thereof devoted to women. Why is this thus? It cannot be\r\n  that you do not think women of enough importance as to be worthy\r\n  some part of it especially fitted for her eye alone. I know our\r\n  editor-in-chief doesn’t feel that way, at least he does not talk\r\n  that way, as every woman knows who ever talked to him for five\r\n  minutes by the clock. I don’t mean a page devoted to Housewives,\r\n  Motherhood, Cooking Recipes, or Fancy Work, altogether. These\r\n  are all good, every one of them, and we are all more or less\r\n  interested in them, but a page, pure and simple, devoted to\r\n  things that women are specially interested in. Will you rise and\r\n  explain, and satisfy several women?\r\n\r\n                                                           E. A. C.\r\n\r\nThe above communication is self-explanatory and is published for what it\r\nis worth. Possibly others of our friends may have something to say along\r\nthis line. At any rate, whatever is worthy of space, pertaining to women,\r\ncan, at least for a time, find expression in this department.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            “LOCAL COLORING.”\r\n\r\n                 (Dedicated to Our Descriptive Writers.)\r\n\r\n                The tale told thrillingly of lemon skies,\r\n                Of salmon hills beneath a blue sunrise;\r\n                It feelingly described a cerise field\r\n                Where purple rabbits ate pink onions, peeled.\r\n\r\n                The color card passed to another pen,\r\n                And lightning changes awed our common ken;\r\n                For lo, we’re told those hills are palest mauve,—\r\n                Like molten gold the fiery sun above.\r\n\r\n                The lemon sky has veered to cherry red,—\r\n                Maroon, the field where purple rabbits fed;\r\n                Has Nature cursed us with a spotted land?\r\n                Nay, “highly colored” tales are in demand.\r\n\r\n                                                    HESTER GREY.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              IN TENNESSEE.\r\n\r\n                      Where the Mississippi washes\r\n                        Round the shores of Tennessee,\r\n                      There’s a large and stately forest,\r\n                        And it’s very dear to me.\r\n\r\n                      There I roamed in days of boyhood\r\n                        With companions free from care,\r\n                      As the tree tops sway ed above us\r\n                        With the west wind playing there.\r\n\r\n                      There we hunted ducks and turkeys;\r\n                        Or as leaves came drifting down,\r\n                      Sat and watched the graceful squirrel—\r\n                        Heard the distant deep-mouthed hound.\r\n\r\n                      I can see the old tent standing,\r\n                        Scent the fragrant coffee pot,\r\n                      And can see the fish a-frying\r\n                        On the coals so red and hot.\r\n\r\n                      We could hear the steamboat whistle,\r\n                        Coming to us from afar;\r\n                      And the wild geese loudly calling\r\n                        Far out on the sandy bar.\r\n\r\n                      As the darkness gathered round us,\r\n                        The tree tops bare and high\r\n                      Seemed to touch with inky fingers\r\n                        The azure autumn sky.\r\n\r\n                      And the shadows in beneath them,\r\n                        Where the firelight did not go,\r\n                      Made a background for dream pictures\r\n                        In those days of long ago.\r\n\r\n                      Ah, those faces in the firelight\r\n                        Glowed with ruddy health and joy,\r\n                      As I pictured golden futures\r\n                        Round the camp fire as a boy.\r\n\r\n                      I have walked the crowded city,\r\n                        With restless, weary feet—\r\n                      In search of praise and pleasure—\r\n                        But neither seemed complete.\r\n\r\n                      For the wine the city offers\r\n                        Must be drunk in little sips,\r\n                      Or like the Dead Sea apples\r\n                        ’Twill be ashes on the lips.\r\n\r\n                      So I’m going back a-camping,\r\n                        ’Neath the sunset’s mellow glow,\r\n                      There to dream the dreams of boyhood\r\n                        As in days of long ago.\r\n\r\n                                             G.

They are doubtless to\r\nbe found there yet, though the great influx of miscellaneous strangers\r\nrenders their racial traits less noticeable than formerly.\r\n\r\nAsk one of the large-framed Swedes, Germans, or other scions of a more\r\npronounced North-of-Europe type, who and what these Latin looking\r\npeasantry are, the chance is you will be answered, or at least would have\r\nbeen at the time I alluded to above:\r\n\r\n“When folks want to be civil they call them Minorcans; when they don’t\r\nthey are mighty apt to say something about Doc. Turnbull’s niggers. So,\r\nthere you are—take your choice.”\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, they are a really worthy and industrious element\r\nof our composite population, not unlike the descendants of Longfellow’s\r\nAcadians, the “Cajuns” of southern Louisiana. Though of a hybrid sort\r\nof Spanish ancestry, from the Balearic Isles in the Mediterranean Sea,\r\nthey have Americanized themselves through several generations of quiet\r\nusefulness in an humble, unobtrusive way.\r\n\r\nWhat is their history? How came they here?\r\n\r\nThat takes us back to the year 1767. The Floridas had only recently been\r\nceded by Spain to England, when some fifteen hundred colonists, mostly\r\nfrom Minorca, one of the Balearic group, were landed at Musquito Inlet,\r\none hundred miles south of St. Augustine.\r\n\r\nMany think that the only people held as slaves in the South prior to\r\nthe Civil War, were negroes, or possibly in very early colonial times,\r\na few spiritless tribes of Indians. Yet these colonists (ancestors of\r\nthe present Minorcans now strung along the lagoons and bayous of the\r\neast coast, intermittently for many leagues) were made, willy-nilly, for\r\nnine long, weary years, to toil amid the swamps and hammocks of what is\r\nnow Volusia County, as the virtual slaves of a British Trading Company\r\nof that era, headed by Sir Wm. Duncan and a Dr. Andrew Turnbull, shrewd\r\nScotchmen of wealth and social position, who operated their scheme from\r\nLondon; Sir William being the resident manager there, and a financial\r\nmagnate on the Stock Exchange himself.\r\n\r\nTurnbull, the immediate head of the colony in Florida, was hard-hearted,\r\nenergetic, indomitable and persevering—one of that unconscionable,\r\nnever-give-up sort of task masters, who worked the helpless peasants\r\nmercilessly in the malarious swamps embraced within the area of the\r\nimmense land grant held by the Company’s charter.\r\n\r\nTradition avers that he founded the original town of New Smyrna, dug\r\ndrainage canals, built stone warehouses, cleared several thousand acres\r\nof dense forest, and began to raise indigo on a large scale.\r\n\r\nThe contracts of the colonists, under which they were to receive\r\nallotments of land, proper wages and maintenance, were ruthlessly and\r\nsystematically violated. The region was then remote and inaccessible, and\r\nthe poor, ignorant peasantry, helpless to a degree hard to realize, in\r\nour own day, outside of, perhaps, Siberia, or Tibet, in far-off Asia.\r\n\r\nSo isolated was that section from all connection with the outside world\r\nthat this sort of thing went on for years without its being known, even\r\nat St. Augustine. The lands were not divided, nor the wages paid.\r\nInstead the Minorcans were compelled to work like the Israelites in\r\nEgypt, under harsh overseers, amid all the discomforts of a semi-tropic\r\nwilderness, environed by savage tribes to the west and south, trailed by\r\nbloodhounds to prevent escape, punished like convicts, and wretchedly\r\nhoused and fed. Guarded also by armed men, their condition was, indeed,\r\nmost forlorn and miserable.\r\n\r\nIt was said that our own Revolution against Great Britain had been going\r\non for a year or more, before these long suffering Minorcans heard that\r\nsuch a thing had been even considered by the more northerly colonies.\r\nThen, however, the worm turned. There was a great uprising, for such a\r\nlife, now tinged with a ray of hope, was unendurable.\r\n\r\nHarsh measures were resorted to by Turnbull, who also evoked the aid of\r\nthe civil law, claiming that the Minorcans had violated their contracts\r\nas a sort of “Redemptioners,” bound to serve for a stipulated period,\r\netc. Some of the ring leaders were taken to St. Augustine by soldiers,\r\nand five actually condemned to death. Of these, two were pardoned; one\r\nwas reprieved, on condition that he act as executioner of the remaining\r\ntwo; a number of others were, for a time, imprisoned.\r\n\r\nThe wretched colonists, however, continued to run away in larger numbers,\r\neither defying or defeating recapture, so that Turnbull eventually\r\nfound himself without labor. The town, the plantations, and the various\r\npublic works were deserted, and the vast enterprises thus despotically\r\ninaugurated, were at last stranded.\r\n\r\nIn vain did he, in the name of the now semi-defunct London Trading\r\nCompany, make most liberal offers of land and wages to his recalcitrant\r\nand vanishing slaves. They wanted no more of Turnbull, his methods, or\r\nhis works. The entire scheme fell through; Dr. Andrew Turnbull went\r\nback to England a ruined man; the town crumbled into ruins, the indigo\r\nplantations lapsed into a second forest growth; the labyrinth of ditches\r\nfilled up, until only the remains of the old canal, some crumbling\r\ncoquina ruins, and the name of the chief despot himself, now given to\r\nthe ancient land grant which was the scene of his cruelties, and known\r\ngenerally as Turnbull Hammock, are left as mementoes of one of the\r\ngloomiest pages of our by no means untroubled colonial annals.\r\n\r\nInstead of a natural increase in numbers during ten years of bondage and\r\nescape, not more than seven or eight hundred of the immigrants were left.\r\nBut they were naturally thrifty and economical. Once scattered out and\r\ndoing for themselves, unburdened by the incubus of Turnbullism, their\r\nnumbers and resources gradually increased. Probably several thousand of\r\ntheir descendants, more or less intermixed with alien blood, still occupy\r\nthe land of their forefathers’ adoption. These are small farmers (engaged\r\nin truck, and semi-tropic fruit growing), fishermen, boat sailors, and\r\npetty traders. A few have risen to social and political eminence as well\r\nas wealth. But these cases are rather exceptional.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, they are patriotic American citizens. The late war with\r\nSpain, for the relief of Cuba, proved that. Many of the younger men\r\nvolunteered for service. Some even went to the Philippines.\r\n\r\n“Free America vur beeg contree,” said a returned soldier to one of his\r\nhome folks who had never seen a hill higher than some of the great shell\r\nmounds on the eastern shore of the Matanzas River. “Mountains higher\r\nthan clouds, lakes wide like sea. Minorcans vur small people. Room for\r\never’one here. Home best place after all.”\r\n\r\nAnd so it is, even for the posterity of those so woefully misused by the\r\nBritish Trading Company’s George the Third methods, as to be miscalled\r\nfive generations later by local detractors, “Turnbull’s slaves.”\r\n\r\n                                                         WM. PERRY BROWN.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              The Mosquito.\r\n\r\nThere are more than three hundred and fifty tribes belonging to the\r\nmosquito race. These have been classified by the detectives of science\r\ninto twenty-two families, and all placed in the same category with\r\ngnats, which are looked upon by most people as suspicious characters.\r\nThese families are known by names of such “learned length and thundering\r\nsound” that it is thought safest to abstain from giving a list of them\r\nhere; but like man, they may be known better by their color, habits and\r\neccentricities than by name.\r\n\r\nThe mosquito is cosmopolitan, for he has explored and settled many parts\r\nof the arctic regions, including Alaska, Greenland and Iceland, and\r\nestablished his home on the continents of Europe, Asia and Africa, and in\r\nthe remotest islands of the sea. He had very probably discovered America\r\nbefore Christopher Columbus set sail for the new world, and it is now\r\npretty certain that he first colonized New Jersey.\r\n\r\nHe has figured extensively in the history of the world, yet he wears no\r\nlaurel wreath of glory for valor in war. All martial victories and renown\r\nof his race belong to the gentler (?) sex of the family. She is a kind\r\nof Joan of Arc, of a fierce, restless and war-like spirit; but it is\r\nconsoling to know that she is less savage in the temperate than in the\r\ntorrid zone; for, we are informed by travelers that in the tropics she\r\noften leads her legions in a charge with fixed bayonets directly upon a\r\nsleeping man’s face, when they fall upon him in myriads, like pelting\r\nhailstones out of a storm-cloud.\r\n\r\nThere are instances of record in which her furious armies have filled the\r\nair for many miles, darkening the heavens like dense columns of flying\r\ncloud, and attacking man and beast like blood-thirsty demons. A Greek\r\nhistorian relates that such an army once swooped down upon ancient Greece\r\nand drove the inhabitants from their homes.\r\n\r\nBesides being thus famous as a soldier, she enjoys the unique distinction\r\nof being a queen of song. Strange to say, in this gift she has a complete\r\nmonopoly, while the male has been left to regret the sad fate of being\r\nforever songless and silent. However, he has been well compensated for\r\nthis privation. Some tribes of his race have less musical talent than\r\nothers; but those who have studied his anatomy, habits and genius declare\r\nthat in tribes in which there are queens of song, he is, without doubt,\r\nthe king of listeners, since nature has provided him with many hundreds\r\nof ears, no doubt to enhance his pleasure from vocal music. These curious\r\nears are small hairs located on his antennæ, or feelers, which, like\r\nthe strings of harp or violin under the touch of a virtuoso, tremble\r\nin unison with the harmony that flows from the living melodion of his\r\nqueen, until his soul is on fire with melody. Not one of these delicately\r\nattuned ears ever seems to be shocked by a falsetto note from the vocal\r\nchords of his charmer. To him her song, like that of Wynomoinen, the\r\nmagical singer, or the sirens of mythical story, is full of the power of\r\nenchantment; and the eavesdroppers of science who watch him and listen,\r\ntell us that he draws near her whenever she pours out her soul in song.\r\nThe manner in which she produces her buzzing tones is very wonderful: The\r\nlower or contralto note is the result of the rapid vibration of her wings\r\nat the rate of three thousand per minute. It is not remarkable, then,\r\nthat her flight is so swift from her enraged human pursuer. But when\r\nshe trills and yodles and sings her high soprano, her fantastic music\r\nflows from stridulating organs which resemble tiny drums at the openings\r\nof minute air tubes. These higher runs thrill Monsignor Mosquito into\r\necstacies of pure delight. His ravished soul is borne out upon the silver\r\nsea of song as he sits on a honeysuckle sipping nectar, listening the\r\nwhile to the wooing voices of his divine inamoratas—the Pattis, Nilssons\r\nand Nordicas of his race. But not so with the human auditor of the\r\nmosquito prima donna who lies peacefully on his bed at night under the\r\nhypnotic spell of sweet sleep. Perchance it is midnight’s holy hour when\r\nhe is suddenly awakened by a still small voice more pricking than the\r\nvoice of conscience. He springs up and lights the gas or lamp and tries\r\nto draw nigh unto lady mosquito as did her enchanted knight with wings;\r\nhe is thirsting for her life while she is thirsting for his blood.\r\n\r\nBut not only is our heroine celebrated in history as a warrior and a\r\nvocalist, but as a most dangerous enemy of mankind. Nature has seen fit\r\nto give her a long nose, or proboscis, which, according to the Darwinian\r\ntheory, might prove her to be related to the elephant. She does not\r\nhesitate “to stick her nose into other people’s business,” and this is\r\nprecisely the thing which, in the case of mosquitoes as of men, leads\r\nher into irreparable injury to humanity and very frequently to her own\r\ninstant demise.\r\n\r\nThose versed in the origin and evolution of the Culex (a nickname for\r\nthe mosquito) teach us that his ancient grandmothers did not have the\r\nblood-sucking habit, but acquired it in later ages. Whether in acquiring\r\nthis habit she was beset, like Mother Eve in Eden, by the power of a\r\nmighty temptation through the wily arts of his Satanic majesty, we are\r\nunable to say with certainty; but we are informed by her anatomists that\r\nalongside her formidable proboscis with its suction pump fixtures, are\r\nfrom two to six keen lances or spears, admirably adapted for making the\r\nnecessary incisions in the skin of man and beast. Armed with such weapons\r\nfor drawing blood, it is easy to guess how, during some of her nightly\r\nwanderings as a minstrel, temptation might have won an easy victory\r\nover her by giving her a taste of blood. It is probable that while on\r\none of these lonely serenades she became enamored of some sleeping\r\nApollo, and, stooping down to snatch a sweet warm kiss from his lordly\r\nbrow, accidentally stuck her bill through the rosy cuticle and drew\r\nblood—taking another sip she said it was good, and thus she contracted\r\nthe blood-sucking habit.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that as with many other nations of the air so\r\nwith this one, there is a sort of national anthem to which the Culex\r\npatriots seem more devotedly attached than human patriots are to theirs.\r\nIts divine strain, to the chivalrous male, is the very keynote of love,\r\nand he is charmed by its resistless power and drawn toward it as a beetle\r\nto a beacon light, or a boat to a whirlpool; for when its clarion note is\r\nsounded, like the weird, wild melody of Orpheus of old that thrilled dumb\r\nbrutes and drew them in myriads around him, he is caught up and borne\r\nonward by its powerful pull to the spot whence the music comes.\r\n\r\nWhile experimenting with harmonic telegraphy, a scientist of the South\r\nwho resides at Jackson, Miss., happened to strike this key, and he\r\nreports that the mosquito came toward the “sounder” in great swarms. He\r\nsoon afterwards devised a machine for electrocuting every mosquito that\r\nshould respond to the magical note. Upon the very first trial they came\r\nteeming to the “sounder,” and when he turned on the electric current by\r\npressing a button, they fell dead by the scores at his feet.\r\n\r\nWhat a boon to humanity this novel application of electricity is\r\ndestined to be. With such an instrument having a “sounder” attached,\r\nthe disturbed sleeper of the future, who is not overly fond of mosquito\r\nsong, can touch a button, by his bedside, to set the “sounder” to going,\r\nand then press another button to turn on the deadly current, and thus\r\ninstantly electrocute every mosquito that disturbs his slumbers without\r\never moving from his pillow. Now, it has been urged by some that only\r\nthe male mosquitoes will answer to the note made by the “sounder,” and\r\nthus only they would suffer death by the device. But this is by no means\r\nestablished, and even if shown to be true, it is evident that upon the\r\nmales being thus dispatched the females would soon all withdraw or pine\r\naway with grief.\r\n\r\nHow vastly different and superior is the male Culex to the female from\r\nan ethical standpoint. He is opposed to war and is a harmless vegetarian\r\nand honey-sucker, while the female is a dangerous savage. He does not\r\nfind his happiness in sucking the blood of his human or other neighbor,\r\nbut in the contemplation of the beautiful. He may well be called the poet\r\nof his race; for he ever lives among the nectar drips and the paradises\r\nof color and perfume of the waiting flowers. He soars aloft into the\r\nsweeter, purer air to bathe his pinions in seas of radiant sunshine. He\r\nroams among the beauties of nature, seeking its sweets from every bud and\r\nleaf. All thoughts that flit across his microscopic brain are free from\r\nblood and war. He loves the beautiful wherever he finds it in the visible\r\nand tangible world and even in the fascinating buzz of his mosquito\r\nprima donna. But as ideally good as he seems to be, he, like man, has\r\nhis faults and frailties. He is fond of travel and has been caught with\r\nmany of his female companions stealing long rides on Pullman palace\r\ncars and ocean steamers. He is also very fond of beer, wine and whisky,\r\nand has been found “dead drunk” on sundry occasions. In this taste for\r\nintoxicants the female Culex does not indulge.\r\n\r\nThe mosquito has been recently charged with murder, arrested and brought\r\nto trial before a competent tribunal composed of medical men and others,\r\nand convicted. They have proved that his spouse is the principal and\r\nhe the accomplice. The evidence shows that they belong to a family of\r\nmosquitoes, known by the infamous name of _Anopheles_, and they have\r\nused malaria, yellow fever and several other diseases with which to slay\r\nman; that the female is the entertainer of a very small creature, a kind\r\nof Jonah, whom she swallows, and after a time he gets down from her\r\nstomach into her proboscis, and when she bites her human victim he leaps\r\ninto the wound where he remains and eats red-blood corpuscles, and when\r\ngrown he breaks up into from six to ten pieces, each piece making a new\r\nanimal life like the original; that they go on multiplying in this way\r\ninto millions in the blood upon which they feast, and thus produce these\r\ndreadful maladies and consequent death.\r\n\r\n                                                                 WATAUGA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                            BOOKS AND AUTHORS\r\n\r\n                  CONDUCTED BY GENELLA FITZGERALD NYE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  PRISON LIFE OF JEFFERSON DAVIS. By Bvt. Lt. Col. John J. Craven,\r\n    M.D. G. W. Dillingham Company, New York. Price, $1.20.\r\n\r\nThe recent controversy concerning General Miles and the shackling of\r\nJefferson Davis while the latter was a prisoner of war at Fortress\r\nMonroe, makes this new edition of Dr. Craven’s book, originally published\r\nin 1866, of timely value and importance. Dr. Craven was the medical\r\nadviser of Mr. Davis during most of his imprisonment, and his notes,\r\ntaken from daily and intimate intercourse with his patient, form the\r\nbasis of this volume. While written with professional reserve and\r\nmilitary discretion, it is a most satisfactory and reliable account\r\nof the facts concerning the imprisonment of Mr. Davis, and throws an\r\ninteresting and significant light on his character as viewed on close\r\nrange by a political enemy at a time when prejudice and passion so\r\ngenerally usurped the place of judgment. Dr. Craven frankly expresses\r\nhis original prejudiced and bitter attitude toward his patient, even to\r\nnaming the precise occasion on which a kindlier sentiment was aroused\r\nin his breast. A stronger, sincerer tribute to Mr. Davis’ character\r\ncould hardly be conceived than this plain and unadorned record of\r\nthe change effected in the attitude of an honest enemy toward the\r\nman whom he abhorred as a kind of moral monster. Dr. Craven was not\r\nonly impressed with the learning and ability of his distinguished\r\nprisoner, but again and again bears impartial witness to his modesty,\r\nfortitude, and unselfishness, relating conversations and incidents which\r\nparticularly impressed him at the time. The strength of that impression\r\nis sufficiently evinced by the fact that Dr. Craven had the courage to\r\npublish such a book at a time when sectional feeling ran so high.\r\n\r\nThe facts in regard to the shameful treatment of Mr. Davis by General\r\nMiles are fully confirmed by copies of the official reports bearing on\r\nthe matter, and the account is a painful commentary on the injustice and\r\ncruelty of the policy allowed to rule in regard to a conquered people.\r\nMr. Davis was sick and feeble; moreover, he was closely guarded night and\r\nday, in an impregnable fortress. Under the circumstances his shackling\r\nwas a wanton and unnecessary humiliation of a helpless man, and the\r\nbare relation of the incident as witnessed by Dr. Craven, though set\r\ndown without comment or criticism, is enough to make the blood of any\r\ngenerous reader boil with indignation and revolt. It is impossible to\r\ndoubt the honesty and accuracy of such a record, and it must remain a\r\nheavy indictment against those responsible for the outrage here detailed.\r\nDr. Craven’s son, who republishes this book, is fully justified in so\r\ndoing, not only for the satisfaction of a present interest, but for the\r\nconsideration of future generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE MARRIAGE OF WILLIAM ASHE. By Mrs. Humphrey Ward. Harper and\r\n    Brothers, New York. Price, $1.50.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ward in her latest novel works very much the same combination which\r\nproved to so exactly fit the public taste in “Lady Rose’s Daughter,”\r\nand if the result is not the same success, it will be only because the\r\npopular impression will be dulled by repetition. Again we have a heroine\r\nnurtured in a scandalous menage in Paris and shadowed by a criminal\r\nheredity, and Lady Kitty, like Julie in the earlier novel, has two\r\nlovers, contrasted in character much as were Delafield and the caddish\r\nyoung soldier to whom Julie so nearly yielded. The crucial moment of\r\ntemptation, however, comes to Lady Kitty after her marriage, and the\r\nhand of fate which snatched Julie from danger plunges the later heroine\r\ninto the abyss of ruin and disgrace. William Ashe, like Marchmont, is\r\nof a noble house and high in political circles, but he is not quite so\r\nmuch of an archangel, though he, too, exhibits a patient and tolerant\r\nforbearance toward the indiscretions and errors of the woman he loves,\r\nwhich, however philosophical, somewhat removes him from the normal human\r\ntype and its sympathies. Geoffrey Cliffe, the objectionable lover, is\r\na poet instead of a soldier, but he, too, woos Kitty to disgrace and\r\nfinally meets a violent death. Both novels are elaborate studies of\r\nheredity, and in each the final decision between irretrievable error and\r\nduty hangs upon an unforeseen incident which turns the scales like a fate.\r\n\r\nAgain Mrs. Ward has drawn on real life for her characters and plot. The\r\nByronic inspiration of Geoffrey Cliffe is sufficiently obvious and the\r\nsuggestion of Lady Caroline Lamb’s story is plainly to be read in Lady\r\nKitty and her obsession. More than one prominent political figure of a\r\ngeneration ago has been promptly identified by the English reviewers.\r\n\r\nOf the two heroines, Lady Kitty is a better realization than Julie, who,\r\nto our mind quite failed to keep the novelist’s promise of intellectual\r\nbrilliancy and social magnetism. It is really a wonderful and poignant\r\nimpression conveyed by Mrs. Ward’s elaborate picture of Lady Kitty,\r\nfrail and fair, passionate and weak, poetic and frivolous, sweet and\r\nperverse—with a lack of moral and mental balance which spells for us\r\nnothing less than insanity. For after all, we are disposed to question\r\nwhether such a character is not properly a study in alienism rather than\r\nin feminine psychology. That she was not a responsible agent, but merely\r\nthe unfortunate creature of her own impelling fancies and passions,\r\nis the view stressed by every implication of the author, and indeed,\r\nagainst the very shady record of Lady Kitty’s life can only be pleaded\r\ntemperamental insanity and hereditary sin.\r\n\r\nAn equally elaborate, but not so successful, piece of work is the\r\npresentation of William Ashe. He is depicted as a kind of Admirable\r\nCrichton—handsome, learned, amiable—a scholar, a statesman, and a social\r\nlion. “Religiously he was a skeptic, enormously interested in religion.\r\nPolitically he was an aristocrat, enormously interested in liberty.”\r\nBut with all the author’s keen analysis and clever descriptive phrases,\r\nthis versatile and philosophical hero never becomes very real to our\r\nperceptions or sympathies. It would seem that his creator had fashioned\r\nand molded him carefully and perfectly, but had failed to breathe into\r\nhim the breath of life.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ward’s rich literary equipment is no less manifest in this novel\r\nthan in her previous works, and her power to deal with the larger\r\ninterests of life is undiminished. The old time English society novel\r\nin her hands has been expanded, dignified, transformed, into a serious\r\nand significant presentation of life and its problems. Her outlook on\r\nthe world of thought, of affairs, and of men and women is technically\r\ninformed and philosophically impartial; her talent is enormously\r\nefficient. Perhaps her remarkable ability was never better demonstrated\r\nthan when she made in “Lady Rose’s Daughter” a deliberate bid for a\r\nwider and lower kind of popular favor. The new appeal, so marked in that\r\nbook and in “The Marriage of William Ashe,” was so skilfully turned and\r\nhas been so successful in enlarging the writer’s clientele, that as a\r\nliterary _tour de force_, it challenges a kind of unwilling admiration.\r\nThere seem to be lacking to her marvelous gifts and powers only the touch\r\nof spontaneity, the flash of dramatic fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE GEORGIANS. By Will N. Harben, author of “Abner Daniel,” “The\r\n    Substitute,” etc. New York: Harper and Brother. Price, $1.50.\r\n\r\nThe plain people of the South, the sturdy common folk who made no\r\npretensions to aristocratic grandeur but who in self-respect, prosperity\r\nand character, formed in this section, as elsewhere, the backbone of\r\ncivilization and society, have not received their due representation in\r\nSouthern fiction, generally speaking. Baronial splendors, “po’ white\r\ntrash” peculiarities, and darky picturesqueness have been the favored\r\nthemes of most Southern story-tellers, moving in the lines of least\r\nresistance to romantic and dramatic interest, while the great middle\r\nclass has been made to occupy a disproportionately small place in their\r\npictures of Southern life. It is not mere accident that the Georgia\r\nwriters have given us the fullest and best treatment of this class, for\r\nin Georgia pre-eminently it dominated and colored the political and\r\nsocial body to a marked degree. Richard Malcolm Johnson, Joel Chandler\r\nHarris, and Watson have all given us stories with a strong flavor of the\r\nsoil and the people who chiefly owned and cultivated it, and Mr. Harben’s\r\ntales of north Georgia have been notably successful in this line of\r\nfiction.\r\n\r\nIn “Abner Daniel,” Mr. Harben achieved one of the rarest things in modern\r\nfiction—a genuine creation. Typically, sympathetically, imaginatively,\r\nAbner Daniel rings true; in spirit and letter he is a perfect\r\npresentation. Broadly human as he is unmistakably North Georgian, he may\r\nbe described as a Southern David Harum; but of the two characters Abner\r\nDaniel seems to us far more vital, far less dependent on his make-up and\r\ngags for reality. In “The Georgians,” Abner reappears, this time as the\r\n_deus ex machina_ of a mysterious murder case, involving the love affair\r\nand various other interests of the story. The little village of Darley\r\nis sketched faithfully and sympathetically, and it is peopled with folk,\r\nwhom we either know, or instinctively recognize as real. Under the not\r\nvery deceptive alias of Tom P. Smith, Mr. Harben pictures a certain noted\r\nevangelist of Georgia and his revivalist methods, while as a companion\r\npiece he presents Jack Bantram, of another ecclesiastical type, who makes\r\na simple and direct appeal to conscience and manhood. The religious\r\nideals and customs of such communities have never received fuller or more\r\nsympathetic treatment than in this story, and, indeed, we may find here\r\nin simple, but effective narration, a most truthful picture of plain,\r\nprovincial Georgia life in all its phases and forms. Among the real\r\nhistorical novels—those which are recording the vanishing social history\r\nof our nation—“The Georgians” deserves place and consideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n  MYSTERIOUS MR. SABIN. By E. Phillips Oppenheim, Author of “A\r\n    Prince of Sinners,” “Anna, the Adventuress,” etc. Boston:\r\n    Little, Brown and Company. Price, $1.50.\r\n\r\nA most remarkable as well as mysterious individual is the villain of\r\nMr. Oppenheim’s latest yarn. He appears in London with a beautiful girl\r\nwho turns all the men’s heads and inspires young Lord Wolfenden with a\r\nsudden and serious passion. By a curious coincidence this young man’s\r\nfather is a retired admiral, with a mania for writing up the coast\r\ndefenses of England, while Mr. Sabin’s mission in England is to get\r\npossession of these papers to sell to the German Emperor. A political\r\nintrigue is involved, in which Mr. Sabin, as agent for the French\r\nBourbons, has conceived the brilliant scheme of buying Germany’s aid with\r\nnaval secrets of England, fully set forth in the maps and notes of the\r\nnaval monomaniac. The success of these plans would be followed by war\r\nbetween England and Germany, and the coronation of Princess Helene—the\r\nmysterious young lady, of course—as Queen of France. There are all sorts\r\nof complications and sensational happenings, and just as things begin to\r\nlook rather dark for the lovers and the peace of England, a nihilistic\r\norder checks Mr. Sabin’s operations and crushes his hopes and ambitions.\r\nThis winds up the troubles of Wolfenden and his Princess, and prefaces\r\nthe most remarkable and exciting adventures of Mr. Sabin as he flees\r\nincognito to America to escape the wrath of the disappointed war lord\r\nof Germany. Greatly to the reader’s relief, this most engaging villain\r\narrives safely in Boston Harbor and we leave him settling down to a\r\npeaceful obscurity with his first love, to whom his bitterest enemy had\r\nrather inconsequentially directed him before he left England.\r\n\r\nTo the critical eye, the machinery of Mr. Oppenheim’s story is somewhat\r\ntoo evident, and occasionally it rattles and creaks, but it goes at\r\na rapid rate, and the result is just what is intended—an interesting\r\nand exciting story, to be read with easy and pleasurable interest and\r\nforgotten immediately.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE MONKS’ TREASURE. By George Horton, Author of “Like Another\r\n    Helen.” Indianapolis: The Bobbs-Merrill Company. Price, $1.50.\r\n\r\nWalter Lythgoe, the nephew of Erasmus Lythgoe, head of the great Lythgoe\r\nBaking Powder, is sent by the firm to Greece to lay in a supply of crude\r\ncream of tartar, and is dispatched on his errand with the admonition,\r\n“Keep out of all scrapes and complications with women.” Naturally\r\nthe first thing done by the young man as he arrives on the island of\r\nAndros is to fall in love with a fair maiden and to immediately involve\r\nhimself in the most gratuitous scrapes and astounding complications\r\never concocted for a novel hero to wriggle out of. Of course the fair\r\nmaiden whom he loves so artlessly and chivalrously as the servant of\r\nthe missionary turns out to be a duchess, and equally, of course,\r\nthe treasure discovered by Walter and his friend in the vault of the\r\nmonastery is her stolen patrimony. Walter conceives the brilliant scheme\r\nof carrying off the bags of gold, and after a series of incredible\r\nadventures, in which he and his Scotch crony pit their wits and courage\r\nagainst a jealous Greek lover and some murderous monks, the hero sails\r\nout triumphant from the island of Andros with his lady love and a trunk\r\nfull of treasure.\r\n\r\nThe local coloring of the story is confined to the adjectives “rosy” and\r\n“purple,” sprinkled plentifully throughout the book, and despite the\r\noften stressed conjunction with the “amphora,” the beautiful Polyxene\r\nseems not widely differentiated from any unsophisticated heroine of more\r\nfamiliar climes. In fact, Mr. Horton has not succeeded in galvanizing a\r\nvery mechanical series of adventures into real vitality by transporting\r\nhis puppets and wheels to Greece.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE RIVER’S CHILDREN: An Idyl of the Mississippi. By Ruth McEnery\r\n    Stuart. New York: The Century Co.\r\n\r\nIn her “Sonny” stories Mrs. Stuart struck the note of original and homely\r\nhumor to which the popular taste is so quick to respond and for that\r\nreason achieved therein her greatest success, but her tales of Creoles\r\nand negroes in the Lower Mississippi region have distinctive merit in\r\ntheir vivid and poetic pictures of the great river and its children. To\r\nher imagination the Mississippi is not the Father of Waters, but “Old\r\nLady Mississippi,” a witch, a siren, a queen—to fear, to propitiate, and\r\nto worship, and to the strength of this conception “The River’s Children”\r\nbears striking testimony. The slender thread of story runs almost unnoted\r\namong the poetic and picturesque descriptions of the river and the quaint\r\nand charming patois of the river people. The great stream sweeps supreme\r\nthrough the book, its poetry, beauty and tragedy looming up larger upon\r\nour impression than the magnificence of the Le Ducs or the rather highly\r\ncolored sketches of Israel and Hannah. Wonderful is the account of Brake\r\nIsland in its days of fatness culminating in the glories of the famous\r\nhouse-party long ago; and a clever bit of reproduction, at once keen and\r\nkindly, is the talk of “Felix” and “Adolphe” on the peril of the rising\r\nwaters. Not even Cable has caught more perfectly the foreign idiom and\r\nsoftened English of these foreign Americans, or their pleasure-loving,\r\nchildlike temperament.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stuart’s imagination and poetry, like her beloved river, sometimes\r\noverflow unhappily, as may be noted in some of the talk between Uncle\r\nIsrael and Mammy Hannah, where instead of the flash of poetic imagery so\r\ncharacteristic of the negro, Mrs. Stuart gives us sustained and elaborate\r\nrhetoric and sentiment. To our perception, too, the story should have\r\nended with the death of the old negro couple, and what follows seems a\r\ndecline to an anti-climax.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stuart is fully imbued with the traditions of the lordly, lavish\r\nlife of the old Creole days, and she knows and loves the land of the\r\nLower Mississippi. The result has been seen in some charming and vivid\r\nsketches of which “The River’s Children” ranks among her best.\r\n\r\n\r\n  RETURN: a Story of the Sea Islanders in 1739. By Alice MacGowan\r\n    and Grace MacGowan Cooke. L. C. Page and Company, Boston.\r\n    Price, $1.50.\r\n\r\nThis is an extremely hollow piece of literary labor, with seemingly no\r\nother inspiration than Mary Johnson’s romances. There is no atmosphere\r\nwherefrom incident or characters could draw any vital semblance, and the\r\nstyle is the thinnest and stalest decoction of Miss Johnson’s manner and\r\ndiction. It is to be hoped that the writers will once for all forswear\r\nthe field of colonial history and romance, and return to their own—the\r\nlife they know and can describe so well in Texas and Tennessee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         THE FIDDLE AND THE BOW.\r\n\r\n                          By Robert L. Taylor.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              PART SECOND.\r\n\r\nWhat is this life but a whirling tide of pleasure and pain—glowing with\r\ngladness, darkening with grief, leaping with rapture, eddying with tears,\r\nnow kissing the smiling cliffs of hope, now dashing against the frowning\r\ncrags of fear and then vanishing in the darkness! What would it all be\r\nworth to us unblessed by love and mercy and the milk of human kindness?\r\nWhat would it all be worth to us bereft of music, that noblest gift of\r\nthe soul?\r\n\r\nThe spirit of music, like an archangel, presides over mankind and the\r\nvisible creation. Her afflatus, divinely sweet, divinely powerful, is\r\nbreathed on every heart and inspires every soul to some higher thought,\r\nsome grander sentiment.\r\n\r\nI heard a great master play on his wondrous violin. His bow quivered\r\nlike the wing of a bird. In every quiver there was a melody, and every\r\nmelody breathed a thought in language sweeter than was ever uttered by\r\nhuman tongue. I was conjured, I was mesmerized by his music. I thought\r\nI fell asleep under its power and was rapt into the realms of visions\r\nand dreams. The enchanted violin broke out in tumult, and in its music I\r\nthought I heard the rustle of a thousand joyous wings and the burst of\r\nsong from a thousand joyous throats; mocking-birds and linnets thrilled\r\nthe glad air with warblings; goldfinches, thrushes and bobolinks trilled\r\ntheir happiest tunes and the oriole sang a lullaby to her hanging cradle\r\nthat rocked in the wind. I heard the twitter of skimming swallows, the\r\nscattered coveys’ piping call. I heard the robin’s gay whistle, the\r\ncawing of crows, the scolding of blue-jays and the melancholy cooing of a\r\ndove. The swaying tree tops seemed vocal with bird song while he played,\r\nand the labyrinths of leafy shade echoed back the chorus.\r\n\r\nThere was a shifting of the bow, and I heard a flute play and a harp and\r\na golden-mouthed cornet. I heard the mirthful babble of happy voices\r\nand peals of laughter ringing in the swelling tide of pleasure. Then I\r\nthought I caught glimpses of snowy arms, voluptuous forms and light,\r\nfantastic slippered feet all whirling in the mazes of the misty dance.\r\nThe flying fingers now tripped upon the trembling strings like fairy\r\nfeet dancing on the nodding violets, and the music glided into a still\r\nsweeter strain. The violin told a story of human life: Two lovers strayed\r\namong the elms and oaks and down by the river side where daffodils and\r\npansies bend and smile to rippling waves, and there, under the bloom\r\nof incense-breathing bowers, the old, old story—so old and yet so new,\r\nconceived in heaven, first told in Eden, then handed down through all the\r\nages,—was told over and over again. Ah! those downward drooping eyes,\r\nthat mantling blush, that trembling hand in meek submission pressed! How\r\nwell they told of love’s victory won and Paradise regained! And then he\r\nswung her in a grape-vine swing:\r\n\r\n  “Swinging in the grape-vine swing,\r\n  Laughing where the wild birds sing\r\n      I dream and sigh\r\n      For the days gone by,\r\n  Swinging in the grape-vine swing!”\r\n\r\nBut the violin laughed like a child and my dream changed again. I saw a\r\ncottage among the elms and oaks and a little curly head toddled at the\r\ndoor. He toddled under the trees, prattling to the birds and playing\r\nwith the ripening apples that fell upon the ground. He toddled among the\r\nroses and plucked their leaves as he would have plucked an angel’s wing,\r\nstrewing their glory upon the green grass at his feet. He chased the\r\nbutterflies from flower to flower and shouted with glee as they eluded\r\nhis grasp and sailed away on the summer air. Here I thought his childish\r\nfancy had built a Paradise and peopled it with dainty seraphim and made\r\nhimself its Adam. He saw the sunlight of Eden glint on every leaf and\r\nbeam in every petal. The flitting honey bee, the whirling June bug, the\r\nfluttering breeze, the silvery pulse beat of the dashing brook, sounded\r\nin his ears notes of its swelling music. The iris-winged humming bird\r\ndarting like a sunbeam to kiss the pouting lips of the upturned flowers\r\nwas to him the impersonation of its beauty. And I said, truly childhood\r\nis the nearest approach in this world to the Paradise of long ago. Then\r\nI saw him skulking like a Cupid in the shrubbery, his face downcast with\r\nguilt, his skirts bedraggled and soiled. He had waded the Atlantic ocean\r\nin the mud puddle, and stirred up the Mediterranean sea in the slop\r\nbucket. He had shipwrecked the young ducks, capsized the goslings, and\r\ndrowned the kitten, which he imagined a whale. And I said, there is the\r\nold original Adam coming to the surface.\r\n\r\n“Lawd bless my soul, jis look at dat chil’! Look at dat face and dem\r\nhands, all kivered wid mud and mulberry juice! You’s gwine to ketch\r\nit! Jis ’zactly like your fadder,—always gittin’ into some scrape or\r\nnudder—always breakin’ into some kind uv debilment! Gwine to brek into\r\nCongress some uv dese days, sho! Dey can’t keep you out’n it! Come\r\nalong wid me dis instinct to de baf tub! I’se gwine to wash dat face uv\r\nyown an’ lucidate some uv dat dirt off’n dem han’s an’ dem clo’es, you\r\ntriflin’ rascal, you!” and so saying she carried him away kicking and\r\nscreaming like a young savage in open rebellion.\r\n\r\nAnd I said, there is some more of the original Adam. Then I saw him come\r\nforth again, washed and dressed in spotless white like a young butterfly\r\nfresh from its chrysalis, and when he got a chance, I saw him slip on\r\nhis tiptoes into the pantry, and there was the clink of glassware as\r\nthough a mouse was playing there among the jam pots and preserves. There\r\ntwo little dimpled hands made trip after trip to a rose-colored mouth,\r\nbearing burdens of mingling sweets that dripped from cheek and chin and\r\nskirt and shoes, subduing the snowy white with the amber of the peach and\r\nthe purple of the raspberry as he ate of the forbidden fruit. Then I saw\r\nhim glide into the library and soon there was a crash and a thud in there\r\nwhich brought a frightened mother into the room only to find the young\r\nrascal catching his breath while streams of cold ink trickled down his\r\ndrenched bosom. And as he wiped his inky face, which grew blacker with\r\nevery wipe, the remainder of the ink was pouring from the bottle onto the\r\ncarpet and making a map of darkest Africa. Then the rear of a small skirt\r\nwent up over a curly head and the avenging slipper in lightning strokes\r\nkept time to the music in the air. And I said, there is Paradise lost!\r\nThe sympathizing, half angry old nurse bore her weeping, sobbing charge\r\nto the nursery and bound up his broken heart, and soothed him to sleep\r\nwith her old-time lullaby:\r\n\r\n  O, don’t you cry, little baby; don’t you cry no mo’,\r\n  For it hurts ole mammy’s feelin’s for to hear you weepin’ so!\r\n  Why do dey bring temptation to de little hands and feet?\r\n  What makes ’em ’buse de baby, kase de jam and ’zarves am sweet?\r\n\r\n  O, de sorrows, triberlations, dat de joys of mortals break;\r\n  O, it’s heaven when we slumber, it’s trouble when we wake!\r\n\r\n  O, go to sleep, my darlin’, now close dem little eyes\r\n  And dream uv de shinin’ angels an’ de blessed Paradise;\r\n  O, dream uv de blood red roses and de birds on snowy wing,\r\n  O, dream uv de fallin’ waters and de nebber endin’ spring!\r\n\r\n  O de roses, O de rainbows! O de music’s gentle swell!\r\n  In de dreamland uv little children whar de blessed spirits dwell.\r\n\r\n“Dar now, dar now, he’s gone! Bless its little heart! Dey treats it like\r\na dog. Ole black mammy’s de best friend de chile’s got in de world!” And\r\nthen she tucked him away in the Paradise of his childish slumbers.\r\n\r\n[_To be continued._]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                SOUTHERN\r\n                                PLATFORM\r\n                               DEPARTMENT\r\n\r\n                        _Devoted to the interest_\r\n                                  _of_\r\n                        _The Lyceum of The South._\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Southern Platform]\r\n\r\n\r\n              The Humorous, the Pathetic and the Dramatic.\r\n\r\nThese are the ruling elements of the platform. Around them are built all\r\nthe successes of the Lyceum, and the lack of them is responsible for all\r\nthe failures that stand like tombstones, along the route, as we journey\r\nwith the truly great.\r\n\r\nWe are all agreed on the efficacy of humor, and we join without dissent\r\nin lauding the man who has the power to make the world laugh. He is as\r\nmuch our benefactor as the man whose scholarly and laborious research\r\nsolves for us some great scientific problem which sets civilization\r\nforward; for, does he not unlock for us the gates of mirth, and climax a\r\nday of toil with an hour of restful merriment? His side-splitting joke\r\npays the Doctor’s bill in advance by keeping us well and hearty; it\r\nsettles pro tem. the grocer’s bill by making us forget it. His clever\r\nstory charms and fascinates us, and we follow him down sunny lanes of\r\nlaughter, and through sighing groves of pathos until the cares and\r\nvexations of our busy lives recede from us like a troubled shore. With\r\nthe God-like power of genius, he leads us out of the thorn-hedged paths\r\nof everyday life, into the happy garden of the ideal where the flowers\r\nof sentiment bloom perennial, and the song of every bird is a lilted\r\nfragment of the universal chorus of love. This magic garden on the margin\r\nof the dusty field of reality from which we dig our daily bread, is an\r\noasis to which we may not long repair, but to linger for an hour rests us\r\nfrom toil and refreshes us for labor. From behind its roses no venomous\r\nserpent is privileged to strike, and from its peaceful skies no hurricane\r\nmay swoop down to lay waste. ’Tis there that the eye of despair is\r\nkindled with hope, the brow of care is smoothed with forgetfulness, and\r\nthe lips of melancholy are curled with a smile.\r\n\r\nAll hail to the man of humor and pathos! (He cannot possess one without\r\npossessing the other.) Pathos is but the gentle sister of humor. Her\r\nemotions have no kinship with sorrow; her tears are the trembling jewels\r\nof tender memories, and she has only to dry her eyes to disclose a smile.\r\n\r\nNext to humor and pathos, the most important requisite to a successful\r\ncareer on the platform, is the dramatic element which enables a man to\r\n“suit the action to the word,” and by the subtle power of the actor’s\r\nart, bring us to worship or despise, at his will, the character he\r\nportrays, or the principle he advocates. We hang at highest tension on\r\nthe words of such a man, when the same words spoken in a commonplace way,\r\nwould send us to sleep in our seats. How often have we seen the beauty of\r\nthe Lord’s Prayer marred by some guttural-voiced exhorter who delivered\r\nit as coldly as he would have read a report of the mule market, or the\r\nprice of pumpkins! and yet it is said that the great Booth with his\r\nincomparable rendition of this sacred prayer could lead an audience into\r\nthe very presence and smile of God. Since time began, the dramatic in art\r\nand literature has received the homage of all people and all nations.\r\nThis love of the dramatic sits enthroned alike in the heart of the savage\r\nand the man of letters, the highwayman and the clergyman, the ignoramus\r\nand the intellectual Titan. This strange attribute in the make-up of\r\nhumanity is at once a dangerous and a glorious element. Too often it\r\nhas nerved the murderer’s hand and steeled the heart of cruelty, but\r\ncivilization is the master which is taming it.\r\n\r\nIn the long gone ages of heartless kings and fawning subjects, when\r\nfierce gladiators met in the death struggle, and the cruel ruler and his\r\nmultitudes cheered the ending of a human life, they were but satiating\r\ntheir unholy love of the dramatic. Before such a picture, the great\r\ncommon heart of to-day turns sick with horror, but there is another\r\npicture dimmed also with many centuries, which makes the blood leap with\r\ndifferent emotions, and which the future will guard with jealous pride.\r\nIt is the dramatic picture of a little band of Christians in the center\r\nof a vast arena, awaiting the approach of the wild beasts which are to\r\ntear their limbs apart, and quietly kneeling in their last prayer. The\r\ndramatic effect of that prayer sent a thrill through all the ages, and\r\nnerved the hearts of the millions who were to follow the martyrs, as no\r\ncommon incident could have done.\r\n\r\nWe worship tragedy, and find satisfaction only in thrilling climaxes, and\r\nout of the multitudes of the passing years, history hands us the names of\r\nonly a few who have paid the price of deathless fame. The tragic death of\r\nJulius Cæsar magnified his mighty deeds a hundred fold, and the dramatic\r\nbut inglorious climax of St. Helena sent the great Napoleon thundering\r\ninto history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  GUY CARLTON LEE, PH.D., LL.D.\r\n\r\n  Dr. Guy Carlton Lee, Literary Editor of the Baltimore _Sun_,\r\n    and formerly of the faculties of Johns Hopkins and Columbia\r\n    Universities, is the latest acquisition of the platform among\r\n    the strong literary men of to-day. He is the most distinguished\r\n    of our younger school of historians, and as an orator he\r\n    belongs to the vigorous, dramatic type so ably represented by\r\n    Wendling and Gunsaulus, who have long been familiar figures\r\n    on the American platform. Dr. Lee’s first lecture tour will\r\n    include the South the coming season, under the direction of The\r\n    Rice Bureau of Nashville.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                              The Mysteries\r\n\r\n                           By James Hunt Cook\r\n\r\nThe early sunlight filtered through the filmy draperies to where a\r\nwondering baby stretched his dimpled hands to catch the rays that lit his\r\nface and flesh like dawn lights up a rose. His startled gaze caught and\r\nheld the dawn of day in rapturous looks that spoke the dawn of Self, for\r\nwith the morning gleam out came the greater wonder. It was the mystery of\r\nLife.\r\n\r\nAcross a cradle where, sunk in satin pillows, lay a still, pale form as\r\ndroops a rose from some fierce heat, the evening shadows aslant, and\r\nspoke of peace. The twilight calm enclosed the world in silence deep as\r\nTruth, and on the little face the wondering look had given place to one\r\nof sweet repose. It was the mystery Death.\r\n\r\nAt head and foot the tapers burned, a golden light that clove the night\r\nas Hope the encircling gloom. Across the cot where lay the fair, frail\r\nform, his hand reached out to hers and met and clasped in tender burning\r\ntouch. Into the eyes of each there came the look that is the light of\r\nlife; that spoke of self to each, yet told they two were one. It was the\r\nmystery to which the mysteries, Life and Death, bow down—the mystery of\r\nLove.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  Thomas Jefferson and the Average Man.\r\n\r\n  [Extract from lecture of Dana C. Johnson on “Thomas Jefferson.”]\r\n\r\nThe epitaph on the monument of Thomas Jefferson, written by himself,\r\nreads thus:\r\n\r\n                             HERE WAS BURIED\r\n                            THOMAS JEFFERSON\r\n                                AUTHOR OF\r\n                The Declaration of American Independence,\r\n                of the Statute of Virginia for Religious\r\n                          Freedom and Father of\r\n                            the University of\r\n                                Virginia.\r\n\r\nThese three deeds he doubtless regarded as the greatest of his life. But\r\nthe real greatness of Thomas Jefferson, and his value to his country,\r\ncannot be comprehended in any recital of specific deeds. His influence\r\nis of a broader scope and flows in a deeper current. He stood for a\r\nprinciple which to-day constitutes the very bulwark of this nation, and\r\nis not only her strength but her pride. That principle is the right of\r\nevery citizen to have a part in the government of the nation—to direct\r\nits policy—to be responsible for its errors—to share in its triumphs.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson recognized the value and stood for the rights of the\r\naverage man, in a time when those rights were in great jeopardy. In this\r\nhe displayed his characteristic political foresight, for the average man\r\nis the backbone of the nation. He has achieved the triumphs of her past\r\nand holds the key to her future destiny.\r\n\r\nIn my mind’s eye I scan the history of our nation as one might view a\r\npanorama.\r\n\r\nI see a company of stern-faced men land on the bleak New England shore\r\nand kneel in prayer upon a rocky beach. They have crossed a stormy ocean\r\nto engage in the hard task of establishing a colony in the New World,\r\nwhere they may worship God as they desire—the earnest, stalwart, heroic\r\nPilgrim Fathers. But who are they? Average men.\r\n\r\nYonder is a company of men standing at Concord Bridge awaiting the\r\nadvance of British regulars. They fight and some fall in the battle and\r\nby that sacrifice become immortal—the first martyrs to American liberty.\r\nWho are they? Volunteer soldiers—farmers and tradesmen—average men of the\r\ncommunity.\r\n\r\nI see a caravan of crude and picturesque conveyances wending their way\r\nacross the Western plains—each wagon containing a family of pioneers—the\r\nadvance-guard of civilization—enduring hardships and performing mighty\r\nlabors of which we reap the benefits. Who are they? Average men and women.\r\n\r\nHere are two armies drawn up in battle order—hundreds of thousands\r\nof young and valiant men; fighting for what they regard their rights\r\nand duties; suffering unspeakable privations and performing deeds of\r\nmatchless valor—the army of the North and the army of the South—whose\r\nconflict demonstrated to the world the extraordinary resources of this\r\nnation, the exceptional qualities of the American soldier and the\r\nabsolutely unconquerable strength of a united country. Who are these\r\nsoldiers? Fathers and sons from farm and store and factory. Average men.\r\n\r\nI see a half-dozen regiments charging a Cuban hillside to dislodge a\r\nfortified enemy—strong, alert, confident soldiers—their courage born of\r\nthe consciousness that they are fighting for right and justice against\r\nwrong and oppression. Who are they? A strange conglomeration of militia\r\nmen, regular army soldiers, nabobs from New York, rough riders from the\r\nplains—but all of them average men.\r\n\r\nSo through all the years of our nation’s history, in the hours of her\r\nperil and of her achievements, she has been saved from shame and has been\r\ncrowned with glory by the deeds of her average men.\r\n\r\nGreat men have arisen from time to time to lead her armies into battle\r\nor to defend her principles of liberty and justice, but, after all,\r\nthese leaders had been powerless and, indeed, impossible except for the\r\nrank and file—the host of average men, who followed them and put into\r\neffect their teaching; not as slaves, but as free men doing their duty as\r\nintellect and conscience had directed.\r\n\r\nWho is it that will determine the future policy of this nation and\r\nwrite success or failure above her gates? Not her millionaires, nor her\r\nstatesmen, nor her scholars, nor her soldiers, but the average men whose\r\nvotes count millions in the aggregate and whose will is law.\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson understood this and read the future with unerring mind.\r\nTherefore he made it his chief concern and his great political work to\r\nprotect the rights and enlarge the privileges of the average man—the bone\r\nand sinew of the state.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HON. ALF TAYLOR,\r\n\r\n  One of the most eloquent and scholarly contributions to the\r\n    intellectual menu of the coming season will be the new lecture\r\n    of Hon. Alf Taylor, “If Columbus Should Wake.”\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SAMUEL SIEGEL.\r\n\r\n  Samuel Siegel, the great mandolinist, who is known to more people\r\n    than any other player of this instrument, is very popular\r\n    throughout the South. He is the originator of the system used\r\n    by the Siegel-Myers Correspondence School of Music, and is\r\n    also exclusive mandolinist for the Edison, Victor and Columbia\r\n    Phonograph Companies. Mr. Siegel will tour the South next season\r\n    at the head of the Siegel-Meyer-Reed Concert Company.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n                          The Lyceum Platform.\r\n\r\n                          By Dr. James Hedley.\r\n\r\nThe Lyceum Platform is one of the world’s evangels. It has its teachers,\r\nheroes, apostles and prophets. It has had a wonderful history, and is\r\nstill making history. It is a marvellous power for intellectual, social\r\nand moral good, and never more so than to-day. Its lecturers are strong\r\nnot only in their ability to entertain, but in all those attributes which\r\nmake for the best in human character. It goes without saying that such\r\nmen come to the people with a message. Whether it be Watterson or Graves,\r\nor De Motte, or Conwell or Wendling, or Willitts; whether Dolliver,\r\nGunsaulus, Hillis, Miller, Bain, McIntyre, McClary, or delightful Bob\r\nTaylor, the minds, hearts and consciences of men are turned in the\r\ndirection of right things, and there is an impetus and an uplift which\r\nblesses all who hear.\r\n\r\nHow wide the influence, and how great the responsibility of the lyceum\r\nlecturer! In a general way, at least, all men concede the power of\r\noratory. The close student of the sources of human influence fully\r\nrecognizes that power, in all its good and evil possibilities. Eloquently\r\nspoken words produce more immediate and fully as permanent results as\r\neloquently written ones. When Demosthenes delivered a patriotic oration,\r\nthe people who heard him said at once, “Let us go and fight Philip!”\r\nA little child after listening to George Whitefield’s beautiful and\r\nimpassioned pictures of Heaven and the Deity, sobbed, “Let me go to Mr.\r\nWhitefield’s God!” There are hundreds in our country to-day who are what\r\nthey are, not only in the success and happiness of their own lives, but\r\nas factors toward the wise solution of the profoundest problems of being\r\nbecause of the spoken words, the messages of the present-day lyceum.\r\n\r\nThe Lyceum Platform thirty and forty years ago could boast of a score\r\nof thinkers, some of whom were orators; they served well their day and\r\ngeneration; products of the “form and pressure of the time,” they met\r\nits requirements, and left behind them evidences of work nobly done, and\r\nno man can say the memory of them shall perish. In far greater measure,\r\nbecause of the infinitely greater number of superior lecturers, the\r\ncommon people to-day are being educated in every phase of thought and\r\npurpose worthy earnest consideration. When one considers all this, the\r\nfaint cry occasionally heard from those who do not take wide views of\r\nexisting conditions, as to the “decay of the lyceum” is not warranted.\r\nWherever and whenever the true lyceum idea is conserved in the work of\r\nthe platform, the evidences of strength, wisdom and beauty are at once\r\nevident and undeniable.\r\n\r\nSince the earlier days, the Lyceum has taken on an entertainment phase,\r\nwhich, while not wholly related to the lyceum idea, serves admirably\r\nin meeting and filling the desire there is and ever will be in the\r\nhuman heart for the joyous pleasures of life. The entertainment side\r\nof the Lyceum belongs to the realm of the heart paramountly, if not\r\nwholly, while the work of the lecturer appeals to the intellect and\r\nthe conscience, and so the “three thirds” which make men up—the Mind,\r\nthe Heart and the Conscience—are accorded that which strengthens and\r\nenriches. Herein have we all of life’s philosophy, brought to us with\r\nmental conviction, with emotional delighting, and spiritual moving. We\r\nget glimpses of what may be called the Trinity of Man. There is no side\r\nof us which does not respond. Let all this triune service of the Lyceum\r\nbe clean and high; let not the desire for financial gain hush one worthy\r\nvoice, or turn aside from the straight path a single lofty purpose,\r\nand the Lyceum shall be maintained so long as time endures, because it\r\nshall be of the blessed things which are not born to die. Lecturers and\r\nentertainers may come and go as individual factors of lyceum work, but\r\nthe Lyceum as an idea, a force, an inspiration, shall go on forever.\r\n\r\nThe traveler looking upon Niagara sees the onward rush and surge\r\nof countless drops of water. They sweep by and pass on, and return\r\nnot again. Still other countless millions of drops follow them, and\r\nforever follow, and so in spite of separateness, there is perpetuity\r\nand permanence. Niagara is immortal. The teachers, heroes, apostles,\r\nprophets, singers and entertainers, come and go, and pass out to the\r\ngreat sea beyond, but others come with word and song and smile, and\r\nforever shall they come, and so as with Niagara, there is perpetuity and\r\npermanence. The Lyceum Platform is immortal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  WARD BAKER.\r\n\r\n  “Music is God’s voice heard in a language without words.”\r\n\r\n  Among the strong popular companies which will visit the South\r\n    next season, is the Boynton Concert Company, and one of the\r\n    leading performers of this Company is Ward Baker.

The\r\nHillsboro Association made preparation for three hundred delegates but\r\nonly about two hundred were in attendance. It was said by all to be one\r\nof the best conventions in every respect that has been held in years in\r\nTexas. The prominent speakers of the convention were Dr. Ira Landrith, of\r\nNashville; Rev. Dr. Carroll, of Dallas, Texas; Dr. T. S. Clyce, president\r\nAustin College, Sherman, Texas; Judge John C. Townes, of Texas State\r\nUniversity, and Dr. S. P. Brooks, president Baylor University, Waco,\r\nTexas. The program was very strong in every particular. The delegates\r\nall expressed themselves as being royally entertained by the citizens of\r\nHillsboro. The only thing that could have added to the pleasure of the\r\ngathering would have been better weather.\r\n\r\nThe Texas Lyceum Association met during the convention and met the\r\ndifferent Bureaus represented and considered their talent. The following\r\nwere represented: New Dixie Bureau, Midland Bureau, Slayton Bureau, and\r\nThe Rice Bureau. After considering all the talent offered, the decision\r\nwas in favor of the Rice Bureau. The Associations of the state have\r\ndealt with the Rice Bureau for several years and their attractions have\r\nbeen first-class and according to representation and the service so\r\nsatisfactory that the members felt that there could be nothing gained by\r\nmaking a change, so the Association business will be with The Rice Bureau\r\nagain the coming season.

To the few it was known as the _Evening\r\nMail_. To the many it was not known at all. We had not advocated\r\nmunicipal ownership, we who conducted the enterprise, but the sheriff\r\nsomehow took it into his head that we did; and as he could not turn the\r\nproperty over to the city, he kept it for the county. I don’t know what\r\nwas finally done with it. I suppose it became but an echo of dust.\r\n\r\nThe paper was “established” by a number of printers and newspaper men who\r\nhad nothing else to do. As we were to share alike in the profits we went\r\nalike to the free lunch counter. It was a pure democracy and the man who\r\nowned fifteen shares of stock received no more than the man who owned\r\none. The paper was edited with longing and printed with hope. We were\r\nall of us optimists. If a cloud arose in our sky we looked upon it as a\r\nballoon ascension. I remember but one day of reproof and censure. The\r\nforeman came into the “sanctum” and said to the editor-in-chief: “There\r\nis trouble in the composing room, sir.”\r\n\r\nThe editor, an old gentleman who loved to write and who vaguely believed\r\nthat eventually one of his editorials might be read from beginning to\r\nend, looked up and sighed.\r\n\r\n“Trouble?”\r\n\r\n“Ah, and serious trouble, sir.”\r\n\r\n“What is it?”\r\n\r\n“Why, Ewing says that he’s got to eat.”\r\n\r\n“Eat!” echoed the editor. “What can he mean by such impudence? Did you\r\nreason with him?”\r\n\r\n“I did, sir; I told him he ought to be ashamed of himself.”\r\n\r\n“And was he?”\r\n\r\n“No, sir; he forthwith gave me an example of insubordination. He accused\r\nme of hiding a sandwich in my desk.”\r\n\r\nThe editor thought a long time. He had written on the situation in\r\nEurope and had given advice to England, France and Germany—he had told\r\nthe Powers what to do with Turkey, but this sandwich required deeper\r\nmeditation. “How many shares of stock does Ewing hold?” he inquired.\r\n\r\n“Ten, I believe, sir.”\r\n\r\n“Well, it seems to me that a man holding so many shares ought to be\r\npossessed of more dignity. Let him transfer his stock to some one who\r\nstands not high in his regard, and resign. You may go. But, wait a\r\nmoment, foreman. If you should happen to have a sandwich hidden in your\r\ndesk, don’t forget me. We have always been good friends, you know.”\r\n\r\nIt was about this time that Major DeMaine made his appearance in\r\nNashville. He came with a heavily-worded recommendation from the Boston\r\nSchool of Oratory. It was declared that he was the greatest orator of\r\nthe day or night. He had talked in Faneuil Hall. It appeared in the\r\npaper Flanel Hall, but that made no difference. He would have been the\r\ngreatest of all actors but that he was religiously inclined and deplored\r\nthe thought of giving up his earnest life to the trivial mimickry of the\r\nstage. He was not well dressed but we ascribed this lack of duds to his\r\nindividuality. But some of us questioned his greatness until he came\r\naround to the office and put into the _Mail_ a full page advertisement.\r\nThen we knew that he was great. This full page was an announcement\r\ntogether with the press notices of his great lecture on Humanity.\r\nBeecher said that it was profound and in an autograph letter Mark Twain\r\nswore that it was funnier than Artemus Ward among the Mormons. We were\r\npossessed of a small job press, and on this machine the tickets were\r\nprinted. We were to receive so much a hundred and we looked forward to\r\na time when we might eat, sitting down. One man, a pampered youth named\r\nBillings, said that he must have a pair of shoes. At first we took this\r\nfor _badinage_, for one of this fellow’s whimsical jokes, but soon we\r\ndiscovered that he meant it. We called a meeting of the faculty. The\r\neditor sighed. For a man who possessed all wisdom he was the most\r\nsighing man I ever knew. With him a sigh answered for declaration and\r\nfor epigram. He was never at a loss for sigh. So he sighed and asked\r\nBillings if he had well considered the situation. Billings answered that\r\nhe thought he had.\r\n\r\n“And you must have shoes, you Beau Brummel! Just at this time of dawning\r\nprosperity you must come forward to swamp our hope with needless\r\nextravagance. Transfer your stock, Billings, and resign.”\r\n\r\nThe lecture was to be given in a building which stood somewhere in Summer\r\nStreet. We were to sell the tickets to our friends and were to share in\r\nthe profits. And with what will we went forth! A stranger might have\r\nthought that the city had been invaded by a gang of hold-up men. Well,\r\nthe night came. We were present, eighteen of us. The editor and the\r\nbusiness manager were absent, having been invited to attend a luncheon\r\ngiven by a politician. But eighteen of us were there to hear that great\r\nout-rush of the human mind. It may have been that the learning was too\r\ndeep for us, that the humor was too skilfully hidden. There was a large\r\naudience and at first there was much applause, but it dropped off along\r\nabout the second round. At the close, however, there came something to\r\narouse our interest. Upon the table the lecturer emptied about a bushel\r\nof cubes wrapped in paper. “Each one of these cubes contains a piece\r\nof soap,” said he. “It is the finest that has ever been made. And this\r\nis the offer that I shall make to you: I shall sell these cubes at\r\ntwenty-five cents each, and in at least half of the papers is contained\r\na yearly subscription to the _Evening Mail_, a paper which Mr. Watterson\r\ndeclares is the freest and best-written journal in America. He himself is\r\nthinking of taking the editorship of it on the first day of next July.\r\nLet us open a few of these papers. Ah, we here have a subscription, here\r\nis another—another—why, there are no end of them. I will now pass out\r\namong you.”\r\n\r\nThey bought his soap. He was giving our paper a boost and none save a\r\ngreat man could do that. Surely, the day of our prosperity was about\r\nto dawn. “I will be around early in the morning to settle for the\r\nadvertisement, the tickets and the many subscriptions,” he said to one of\r\nus. “And now don’t think me presumptuous in what I said. Watterson has\r\nhis eye on this paper.”\r\n\r\nHe did not come around the next day. We called on the business manager\r\nand he said that no arrangements for subscriptions had been made with\r\nhim. We spoke to the editor and he sighed. Then, and for days afterward,\r\nthere came broken streams of people with orders for yearly subscriptions.\r\nIt was difficult to explain. The most of our stockholders had been\r\npresent and had heard the promises made by Major DeMaine. So we dozed off\r\ninto the bed prepared by the sheriff.\r\n\r\nThe last time I saw the editor he took my hand with a sigh and said: “It\r\nwas a great pity that I went to that political luncheon. Ah, politics,\r\nruination of mighty empires!”\r\n\r\nYears afterward, in company with Col. Zeb. Ward, I was going through the\r\nArkansas penitentiary. Near the wall I observed an oldish man washing a\r\nbuggy. He had a familiar look, in spite of his stripes, and I spoke to\r\nColonel Ward concerning him. “He is known as Commodore Sassafrac,” said\r\nthe Colonel. “He got up a great land scheme down in the bottoms—told the\r\nnegroes that he had the management of the great Mexican war land claim.\r\nSeventy million acres were set aside for the colored citizens, and all\r\nthey had to do was to show an order from the Commodore, which he gave for\r\nfive dollars apiece.”\r\n\r\nI went up to him and spoke. He looked at me. I reminded him of the\r\n_Nashville Evening Mail_. “Ah,” said he, “I am pleased to meet anyone\r\nfrom the glowing past. Back upon that time I look with fondness. Your\r\ngreat journal made life worth living.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  DAVID BISPHAM,\r\n\r\n  One of the great stars of Grand Opera, who devotes a few weeks of\r\n    his time each season to lyceum work.
