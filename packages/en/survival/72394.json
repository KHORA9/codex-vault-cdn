Sackett.=\r\n\r\nIn driving through the fruit-growing sections of the United States, \r\none cannot fail to be impressed with the fact that thousands of \r\nbushels of apples and other fruit are allowed to go to waste annually \r\njust because it is too much trouble to gather it up and make some use \r\nof it. This is particularly true during a season when prices are low \r\nowing to an overproduction. Such a practice would be condemned, most \r\ncertainly, by any commercial firm, and rightfully so, as a most \r\nextravagant waste and far removed from any principle of scientific \r\nmanagement. Talk with any captain of industry, and he will invariably \r\ntell you that the largest profits in his business accrue from the \r\ncomplete utilization of the waste products.\r\n\r\nIndifference to the needs of others and ignorance of the latent \r\npossibilities in this second grade fruit are largely responsible for \r\nthe fruit grower’s short-sightedness. He is apt to forget that there \r\nare a few more than ninety-three million others in this country who \r\nare dependent upon him for orchard products such as cider, apple \r\nbutter, jelly and vinegar, all of which could be made from this fruit \r\nwhich he permits to rot unnoticed under the trees. Could he only be \r\nshown the roll of greenbacks or catch the glitter of the gold which \r\nwould represent his actual net return from the complete utilization \r\nof this unnecessary waste, rotten apples, wormy apples, green apples \r\nand everything would be cleaned up the next time we should pass by \r\nhis orchard.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the fact that thousands of gallons of white wine vinegar, \r\nwhich has never been near a wine press, are produced yearly by a \r\npurely chemical process from alcohol, there is still a market for \r\ngood, old-fashioned, apple cider vinegar. The genuine article will \r\nnever be entirely replaced by the artificial product. But where is \r\nthe public to obtain pure apple vinegar of acceptable quality? It is \r\nnot for sale at the local groceries except in sealed bottles at \r\ntwenty-five cents a quart. Beside it on the shelf may be found the \r\ndistilled vinegar, artificially colored with caramel, and the white \r\npickling vinegar at fifteen cents a bottle. In bulk the distilled \r\nvinegar can be bought for forty cents the gallon with a reliable \r\nguarantee behind it for strength and quality. But you say, [Page 4] \r\n\"Surely you must be mistaken about not being able to get cider \r\nvinegar from your grocer in bulk.\" No, gentle reader, do not be \r\ndeceived by the stencil mark on the end of the barrel. If, perchance, \r\nthis particular lot came from a nearby ranch, the odds are in favor \r\nof its not being worth carrying home. Do not understand me to speak \r\nthus lightly of all home-made vinegar for there is some to be found \r\nof splendid quality, but it is the exception. As a rule the \r\nstorekeeper will apologize to the customer for his farm vinegar, but \r\nwith that which comes from the wholesale dealer it is different. Most \r\ncertainly a sad condition, when the first and best vinegar that was \r\never made came from the farm home! What is more, it cannot be \r\nobtained from the farmer or apple grower today for most of them are \r\nbuying all of the vinegar they use.\r\n\r\nWhat has become of our apple vinegar industry, and why have the \r\nmerchants turned their attention to the distilled article? The answer \r\nto this can be had without pursuing an extensive investigation into \r\nthe economics of the question. It is simply this—the average run of \r\nfarm vinegar is so inferior to the distilled product that the \r\nmerchants cannot afford to handle it. The quality is so variable and \r\nthe strength is so unreliable that the good housewife has learned \r\nthrough the repeated experience of having her pickles spoil not to \r\nask for cider vinegar.\r\n\r\nThere is no good reason why this condition of affairs should exist \r\nwhich has resulted in placing a boycott on the farm product, but in \r\nthe light of the facts as they actually exist, is not the consumer \r\njustified in taking this stand? There is no doubt that the synthetic \r\narticle has come to stay, but this does not mean that genuine apple \r\nvinegar is a thing of the past. However, until we are able to produce \r\nas good or better vinegar on the farm and in the orchard and can \r\nguarantee its quality and strength to be reasonably constant, we have \r\nno right to ask or to expect the public to buy an inferior product or \r\nto help build up the industry by its patronage.\r\n\r\nIt is just as easy to make high-grade apple vinegar at home when one \r\nunderstands the different operations and principles involved as it is \r\nto make good butter or good bread. If the housewife knew as little \r\nabout making butter and baking bread as the average farmer or \r\norchardist knows about making vinegar, we should all forsake the \r\nstaff of life and take refuge in the nearest sanitarium.\r\n\r\n[Page 5]\r\n\r\n_Selection of the Apples._\r\n\r\nWhat has been said above concerning second grade fruit for cider and \r\nvinegar is not to be construed as meaning rotten, wormy, dirty, or \r\nunripe fruit. Nothing is gained by such a practice and often all is \r\nlost. In the first place, it is impossible to cover up the flavor of \r\nthe spoiled apples in the vinegar, and in the second place, when \r\ndecayed and dirty fruit is employed, it is practically out of the \r\nquestion to control the fermentations in the cider upon which the \r\nquality of the finished product depends almost entirely.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason why apples which have merely been bruised should \r\nnot be used, and where they are not too badly rotted, the soft \r\nportion can be cut out. Children are always glad to have a hand in \r\ncider making and this is just where their services will fit in \r\nnicely. Remember that many hands make light work and likewise clean, \r\nacceptable cider, and you will be surprised to see in how short a \r\ntime the spoiled parts can be removed from the bushels of otherwise \r\nworthless apples.\r\n\r\nThe importance of washing the apples thoroughly with clean water \r\nbefore they go to the mill to be ground cannot be overestimated. \r\nThere is bound to be a quantity of soil and dust clinging to the \r\noutside, particularly where the orchards lie along a public road and \r\nare clean cultivated so that the apples fall on plowed ground. This \r\ncan be carried out very conveniently in an ordinary washtub, after \r\nwhich the apples should be allowed to drain before they are ground. \r\nOne is always astonished at the amount of mud in the water after such \r\nan operation, even when relatively clean, hand-picked fruit is \r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nLet us see next whether all varieties of apples are equally well \r\nsuited to cider vinegar making; whether a good cider apple is \r\nnecessarily a good vinegar apple; and what constituent or \r\nconstituents of the apple determine its usefulness for these \r\ndifferent purposes.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the first question, it may be said that apples differ \r\nvery widely in their adaptability to cider and vinegar making; some \r\nappear to have been created for this very purpose, while others would \r\nnot do at all.\r\n\r\nConcerning the second point, we find it is quite often the case that \r\nan apple which makes an excellent cider to drink would not make good \r\nvinegar. This is due to the fact that most tastes demand a cider that \r\nis not too sweet and with a slight acidity. Such [Page 6] apple juice \r\nwould be very apt to make weak vinegar because of the relatively \r\nsmall amount of sugar present.\r\n\r\nThis reference to sugar brings us to the third item, namely, the \r\nimportant constituents of the apple so far as cider and vinegar are \r\nconcerned. Several years ago, Dr. Van Slyke of the Geneva, N. Y., \r\nExperiment Station, reported a series of analyses of apple juices \r\nrepresenting eighty-three different American-grown varieties. He \r\ngives the average composition of these juices as follows:\r\n\r\nSolids                            13.52 per cent\r\nTotal sugar as invert sugar       10.91 per cent\r\nAsh                                 .29 per cent\r\nFixed acid (malic)                  .52 per cent\r\n\r\nThe sugar is unquestionably the most important of these substances so \r\nfar as the part which it plays in the making of cider vinegar since \r\nthe degree of sourness due to the vinegar acid (acetic) is directly \r\nproportional to the fermentable sugar present; in other words, all of \r\nthe acid which was not originally present in the cider as natural \r\napple acid, or malic acid, is produced from the sugar by processes \r\nwhich are soon to be described. Therefore, since from a given amount \r\nof sugar just so much acid and no more can be made, we can understand \r\nquite readily that for a high grade vinegar of maximum acidity the \r\napple juice containing the most sugar will be the most desirable. The \r\namount of natural acid present in the juice plays an insignificant \r\npart in the final acidity of the vinegar, since the small quantity \r\nthat is present in the apple juice practically all disappears during \r\nthe change into vinegar. From this it is clear that it is the sugar \r\nand not the natural apple acid that is to be considered in cider for \r\nvinegar.\r\n\r\nNow, as has been stated above, cider for table use is usually more \r\npleasant to drink when it is not too heavy and when the sugar is \r\nlower and the acid somewhat higher than the standard for vinegar \r\ncider requires.\r\n\r\nThe composition of the juice of some of our common commercial \r\nvarieties, especially the sugar content, may be of interest at this \r\ntime in connection with what has been said with reference to the \r\nsuitability of different ciders for vinegar making. The [Page 7] \r\nanalyses which I am submitting are those given by Dr. Van Slyke* for \r\neastern apples.\r\n\r\n\r\n*Van Slyke, L, L., Bulletin 258, Geneva, N, Y., Exp.

(Ben Davis 6.74-10.60).\r\n\r\nThe amount of sugar depends upon a number of factors such as soil, \r\nclimate, culture, variety, and ripeness, unripe and over-ripe apples \r\ncontaining less sugar than ripe ones.\r\n\r\n+ Browne has shown very clearly the changes that take place in the \r\nsugar content of apples at different periods of ripeness:\r\n\r\n\r\n+ Browne, Annual Rept.

All things being \r\nequal, there is no reason why they should not, provided they contain \r\nas much sugar as the more acid kinds. This statement may seem \r\nsomewhat paradoxical, but it should be remembered that [Page 8] it is \r\nthe presence of acid rather than the absence of sugar that makes an \r\napple taste sour. As a matter of fact, some of our very sourest sorts \r\ncontain as much and more sugar than the sweetest sweet apples. Cider \r\nfor vinegar should not contain less than 8.5 per cent. of sugar.\r\n\r\n_Storage of the Cider._\r\n\r\nThe most satisfactory containers for both cider and vinegar are \r\nwhisky and brandy barrels. Molasses barrels and old vinegar barrels \r\nshould be used only when no others are available, and then not until \r\nthey have been very carefully and thoroughly cleaned. Too much stress \r\ncannot be laid upon the necessity of scalding old vinegar barrels \r\nwith either live steam or boiling water to remove the last trace of \r\nthe old vinegar. There is, perhaps, no one factor which is \r\nresponsible for more failures in farm vinegar making than the \r\ntime-honored but pernicious custom of using old vinegar barrels for \r\nsweet cider without even rinsing out the dregs of former years. Mere \r\nrinsing is not sufficient. They must be scalded to make them fit for \r\nuse. If this is not done in such a manner as to kill all of the \r\norganisms in the barrel, the probability is that the sweet cider which \r\nis put in them subsequently will never make vinegar. The reason for \r\nthis will be given a little later. In a recent number of a certain \r\nfarm journal, the following is given under directions for making \r\napple vinegar:\r\n\r\n\"Get a barrel in which good vinegar has been made and use it, or get \r\nsome of the scum off of the top of good vinegar and rinse out the new \r\nbarrels with this as soon as they cool after having been thoroughly \r\nwashed out with boiling water. Put fresh cider into these barrels.\"\r\n\r\nNo procedure more absurd and dangerous to the success of apple \r\nvinegar could possibly be undertaken than is contained in this \r\nrecommendation. In fact, it would be difficult to find a better \r\nrecipe for vinegar failures than this. Never, under, any \r\nconsideration, put either \"mother\" or old vinegar into sweet cider. \r\nIt is never safe to use metallic containers for holding cider even \r\nfor an interval of a few hours, since the acid of the juice attacks \r\nthe metal, dissolving a portion of it. Such cider, because of the \r\nmetal in solution, might produce metallic poisoning in the person \r\ndrinking it.\r\n\r\nThe sweet cider as it comes from the press may either be placed at \r\nonce in barrels, which should not be filled more than two-thirds to \r\nthree-fourths full, or if one has suitable wooden tubs or vats in a \r\nclean, cool place, it may be stored there for twelve to [Page 9] \r\ntwenty-four hours to permit settling, after which it should be \r\ntransferred to barrels. The bung should be left out and a loose \r\nstopper of cotton batting inserted in the hole to decrease \r\nevaporation and prevent dirt from falling in. The barrels should not \r\nbe tightly stoppered until the vinegar contains at least 4.5 to 5.0 \r\nper cent. of acetic acid, at which time they should be filled \r\nentirely full and securely bunged. Throughout the entire period of \r\nvinegar making, the casks should be placed on their side and not on \r\nthe end. This gives the cider a larger free surface exposed to the \r\nair, which is quite essential to rapid vinegar formation. It may be \r\nof some advantage in admitting air to bore a one and one-half inch \r\nhole in each end of the barrel along the upper edge. If this is done, \r\nthe holes should be covered with fine wire gauze or two thicknesses \r\nof cheese cloth to exclude small vinegar flies.\r\n\r\n_The Alcoholic Fermentation._\r\n\r\nA few days after the cider is put into the barrels, the \r\ncharacteristic frothing appears at the bung-hole. To use a common \r\nexpression, \"It is beginning to work.\" This indicates that the \r\nalcoholic fermentation, the first step in the vinegar making process, \r\nhas begun, and the sugar of the apple juice is being converted into \r\nalcohol and carbon dioxide gas.\r\n\r\nThe first of these substances is too well known to need any further \r\ncomment other than to state that it is this element of \"hard\" cider \r\nthat gives it its intoxicating property. With carbon dioxide, many of \r\nus are not as well acquainted. It is this gas escaping from the \r\nfermenting cider that causes the frothing and likewise the foamy \r\nappearance of the bread sponge. It is this gas dissolved in the cider \r\nor in the carbonated drinks at the soda-water fountains that imparts \r\nto them the characteristic bite or tingle, and upon escaping from the \r\nstomach produces that peculiar sensation in the head and nose. \r\nStrangely enough, this same gas is the active principle of \r\npractically all chemical fire extinguishers.\r\n\r\nNow, what is the exciting agent which starts up the fermentation in \r\nthe bread sponge and in the sweet cider? In both cases it is the \r\nsame: a microscopic organism, the yeast plant. In the one instance we \r\nadd a yeast cake to the bread mixture; in the other we either trust \r\nto the wild yeasts of the air and the skin of the apples or following \r\nthe more recent, approved method, we add a yeast cake or a pure \r\nculture of a yeast selected especially for this purpose.\r\n\r\nTo depend upon the wild yeasts of the air to accomplish the \r\nfermentation is too uncertain since many of them are able to \r\n[Page 10] convert only a small part of the sugar into alcohol, while \r\nothers act so slowly that they are impracticable. Inasmuch as the \r\npercentage of acetic acid in the vinegar depends directly upon the \r\namount of alcohol produced, it is very essential to secure as large a \r\nyield of alcohol as possible from the sugar present. This means \r\nconverting all of the sugar into alcohol in the shortest time \r\npossible. The most satisfactory way of doing this is to add one cake \r\nof compressed yeast, stirred up in a little cooled, boiled water, to \r\neach five gallons of sweet cider. In place of this, one quart of \r\nliquid wine yeast, propagated from a pure culture, may be used for \r\neach thirty gallons of cider.\r\n\r\nDuring the alcoholic fermentation, the cider should be kept at a \r\ntemperature of 65 to 80 degrees F. Here is where many make the very \r\nserious mistake of putting their fresh cider into a cool cellar where \r\nthe fermentation takes place entirely too slowly. If the cider is \r\nmade in the fall, the barrels should be left out of doors for a while \r\non the protected, sunny side of a building and kept warm, unless a \r\nregular vinegar-cellar, artificially heated, is at hand.\r\n\r\nIf yeast is added and the proper temperature is maintained, the \r\nalcoholic fermentation should be completed in six weeks to three \r\nmonths in place of seven to ten months as in the old fashioned way. \r\nExperiments along this line have shown that when yeast is added and a \r\ntemperature of 70 degrees F. is held, the cider at the end of one \r\nmonth contained 7.25 per cent. of alcohol as against .11 per cent. \r\nwhen no yeast was used and the temperature was between 45 and 55 \r\ndegrees F. Cider kept in a cellar at 45 to 55 degrees with no yeast \r\nadded required seven months to make 6.79 per cent. of alcohol.\r\n\r\nTemperature, alone, is an important factor as shown by an experiment \r\nwherein cider to which no yeast was added was held for three months \r\nat 70 degrees F. and yielded 6.41 per cent. of alcohol.\r\n\r\nThere is no question but that the time required for completing the \r\nalcoholic fermentation can be reduced at least one half by adding \r\nyeast and by maintaining the proper temperatures. By hastening this \r\noperation, the loss of alcohol by evaporation is reduced, and the \r\nacetic fermentation can be started that much sooner.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, 100 parts of sugar should give 51 parts of alcohol and \r\n49 parts of carbon dioxide gas. This figure has been shown by Browne \r\nto be a little high. In actual practice, 45-47 parts of alcohol from \r\n100 parts of sugar is a fair average.\r\n\r\nBut why not add \"mother\" or vinegar to sweet cider or put [Page 11] \r\nsweet cider into an old vinegar barrel? Here is the reason: We have \r\nseen from what has gone before that alcohol is produced from the \r\nfermentation of the sugar. We shall soon learn that the acetic acid \r\nof the vinegar is formed from this alcohol. Now, in order to obtain \r\nthe maximum amount of acetic acid, it is necessary to have as much \r\nalcohol as possible in the hard cider, and this can be obtained only \r\nby the complete conversion of all the sugar into alcohol and carbon \r\ndioxide gas. The complete destruction of the sugar can be \r\naccomplished only by the uninterrupted action of the yeast, and the \r\npresence of \"mother\" of vinegar by producing acetic acid interferes \r\nseriously with this fermentation. The yeast cells are either killed \r\nor their useful activity is checked long before all of the sugar has \r\nbeen changed into alcohol. This is the condition of a very large \r\npercentage of farm vinegar—just hard cider that will not and never \r\nwill make vinegar. It means just this:\r\n\r\nA small part of the sugar was made into alcohol and this alcohol was \r\nat once changed to acetic acid by the \"mother\" present; this acetic \r\nacid killed the yeast so that no more sugar could be changed to \r\nalcohol and no more alcohol being found, no more acetic acid could be \r\nmade by the \"mother.\" We have a weak, worthless something neither \r\nvinegar nor hard cider with considerable unfermented sugar still \r\npresent and incapable of further fermentation because no yeast can \r\ndevelop in the weak acetic acid solution.\r\n\r\n_The Acetic Acid Fermentation._\r\n\r\nThe second step in vinegar making is the change of the alcohol of the \r\nhard cider into the acetic acid of the finished product. This is \r\naccomplished by the acetic acid germ, another microscopic plant still \r\nsmaller than the yeast. In some peculiar way it is able to bring \r\nabout a union between the alcohol of the hard cider and the oxygen of \r\nthe air so that the alcohol is transformed into acetic acid and water.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the alcoholic fermentation, described in the preceding \r\nsection, is completed, draw off the clear liquid, being very careful \r\nnot to disturb the sediment in the barrel. Wash out the barrel \r\nthoroughly and replace the hard cider. It is believed that removing \r\nthis sediment permits the acetic acid to form somewhat more quickly, \r\nand furthermore, the sediment may undergo decomposition and impart a \r\ndisagreeable flavor to the cider. Again, these dregs may harbor \r\nliving bacteria which either destroy acetic acid or interfere with \r\nits formation.\r\n\r\nThis done, we are now ready to introduce the acetic acid [Page 12] \r\ngerms. This may be carried out in a number of different ways, but \r\npreferably by means of a pure culture of a desirable organism which \r\nhas been selected because of its ability to produce strong acetic \r\nacid and to impart an agreeable flavor to the vinegar. In place of \r\nthe pure culture starter, one may add two to four quarts of good \r\ncider vinegar containing more or less \"mother\" for each barrel. The \r\nintroduction of a desirable organism is left to chance in this case. \r\nA serious objection to this latter method is that sometimes one \r\nintroduces foreign organisms with the \"mother\" which may prove \r\ndetrimental to the vinegar. The pure culture starter is free from \r\nthis objection. On the whole, the indiscriminate use of \"mother\" \r\nalone is to be discouraged, since the popular idea of what \r\nconstitutes \"mother\" is apt to be wrong. Pure \"mother\" is made up \r\nexclusively of acetic acid bacteria and is recognized as the thin, \r\nwhite, glistening, gelatinous membrane that forms on the surface of \r\nvinegar. It seldom becomes one sixteenth of an inch in thickness and \r\nshould be translucent or white in color, It is entirely distinct from \r\nthe thick, tough, dark brown, slipping, leathery masses which form in \r\nvinegar and are usually regarded as \"mothy of vinegar.\" Such \r\naccumulations contain the acetic acid germ, in all probability, but \r\nin an impure state. In addition to this organism there may be present \r\nyeast cells and numerous bacteria which are positively harmful to the \r\nvinegar. Often these growths undergo decomposition and give the \r\nvinegar a flavor of rotten oranges. Again the germs present may cause \r\nthe partial or complete loss of the acid, particularly if the barrels \r\nare not full and tightly stoppered. All things taken into \r\nconsideration, the use of this sort of \"mother\" is a rather dangerous \r\nprocedure.\r\n\r\nWith the acetic fermentation, as with the alcoholic, the higher \r\ntemperatures favor the changes. Experimental work shows that hard \r\ncider to which no acetic acid bacteria were added other than those \r\nthat came from the air, and kept at 65 degrees F., when six months \r\nold, contained 7.03 per cent. of acetic acid, while that held at 55 \r\ndegrees F. showed only 3.63 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe addition of some kind of an acetic acid starter, either as a pure \r\nculture of the acetic organism or as good vinegar, hastens the \r\nfermentation and reduces appreciably the time required for making \r\nmarketable vinegar.\r\n\r\nFor most satisfactory results we would recommend using the pure \r\ncultures and holding the vinegar at a temperature of 65 to 75 degrees \r\nF. Under these conditions, salable vinegar can be obtained in three \r\nto six months in place of two to three years, as is often [Page 13] \r\nthe case. Theoretically, 100 parts of alcohol should give about 130 \r\nparts of acetic acid, but in actual practice this will probably fall \r\nbelow 120.\r\n\r\nWhen the acetic acid has reached 4.5 to 5 per cent., fill the barrels \r\nas full as possible and cork tightly. In this way, contact of the air \r\nwith the vinegar is cut off and the acetic acid organisms soon cease \r\ntheir activity. If this is not done and the acetic and other bacteria \r\nare allowed to develop indefinitely, there is apt to be a reverse \r\nreaction resulting in a partial or complete loss of the acetic acid. \r\nSuch vinegar is, of course, worthless.\r\n\r\n_Clarification of Vinegar._\r\n\r\nFor those who desire an extra fancy product of extraordinary \r\nbrightness, suitable for bottling, it will be necessary to subject \r\nthe vinegar to a special process of clarification known as fining. \r\nAccording to Bioletti*, the best results are obtained by using \r\nisinglass. This is employed at the rate of from one-half to \r\nthree-fourths of an ounce of isinglass to each one hundred gallons of \r\nvinegar.\r\n\r\n\r\n* Bioletti, Frederic T., Grape Vinegar, Bull. 227, California Exp. \r\nSta., 1912.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"The isinglass is cut into small pieces and soaked for twelve to \r\ntwenty-four hours in a little water containing acetic or tartaric \r\nacid equal in weight to the isinglass used. When thoroughly soft it \r\nis then rubbed several times through a fine sieve, gradually adding a \r\nlittle more water until a perfectly fluid liquid is obtained. This \r\nfluid is then well mixed with a little vinegar and thoroughly stirred \r\ninto the cask. With some vinegars it is necessary to add a little \r\ntannin, from one-half to one-seventh the amount of the isinglass \r\nused. This tannin should be added at least twenty-four hours before \r\nthe finings.\r\n\r\nWhen the finings have settled and the vinegar is perfectly bright it \r\nis ready for bottling.\"\r\n\r\n_Pure Cultures for Vinegar Making._\r\n\r\nReference has been made above to the use of pure cultures, both yeast \r\nand acetic acid bacteria, for vinegar making. For a little more than \r\none year, the Bacteriological Laboratory of the Colorado Experiment \r\nStation has been supplying these at fifty cents (50c) per set, post \r\npaid, sufficient for one barrel, to those who care to give them a \r\ntrial. Full printed directions for their use are included. These \r\ncultures have been selected because of certain properties which they \r\npossess which make them especially suited to the vinegar industry. No \r\nguarantee, either expressed or [Page 14] implied, goes with the \r\ncultures, since it is not the purpose of the Experiment Station to \r\nexploit these products, but rather to distribute them at the cost of \r\nproduction for experimental purposes. Inasmuch as one of the cultures \r\nis to be added to the sweet cider, the set should be obtained a few \r\ndays, not longer, before the cider is to be made.\r\n\r\nRequests for cultures should be addressed to the Bacteriological \r\nLaboratory, Colorado Experiment Station, Fort Collins, Colorado, and \r\nshould be accompanied by a remittance of fifty cents (50c).\r\n\r\n_Directions For Using Pure Cultures in Making Vinegar Preparation of \r\nYeast Culture._\r\n\r\n1. For each barrel of sweet cider, sterilize one two-quart Mason jar \r\nby washing thoroughly and boiling for five minutes in clean water.\r\n\r\n2. Cover the top of the jar with a single layer of clean muslin or \r\ncheese cloth just removed from boiling water and secure it in place \r\nby a string tied about the neck of the can.\r\n\r\n3. Select 6 or 8 medium sized _ripe_ apples; pare and quarter or slice \r\nthem; add one quart of water and boil till soft; strain liquid \r\nthrough clean cloth while hot into Mason jar, first removing the \r\ncloth covering from the top.\r\n\r\n4. Make up the volume of liquid to approximately one quart with \r\nboiling water; add 4 tablespoonfuls of sugar and replace the cloth \r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\n5. When the liquid has cooled thoroughly, partly remove the cloth \r\ncovering and add the contents of the culture bottle marked \"Yeast.\" \r\nReplace the cloth. Just previous to opening the culture bottle, shake \r\nthoroughly and immerse the lip and cork only, ten second in boiling \r\nwater. Do not touch the lip while removing cork.\r\n\r\n6. Keep the jar in subdued light at a temperature of 75 degrees F. to \r\n90 degrees F. After two to four days the foaming characteristic of \r\nalcoholic fermentation should appear.\r\n\r\n7. After four to six days, add the entire contents of the _yeast_ jar \r\nto the barrel of freshly made _sweet_ cider. _The barrel must not be \r\nmore than two-thirds full;_ it should be placed on its side, and the \r\nbung-hole be left open, or, better, plugged loosely with a tuft of \r\nclean cotton batting.\r\n\r\n8. Keep the barrel at 75 degrees F. to 85 degrees F.\r\n\r\n[Page 15]\r\n\r\n_Preparation of Acetic Culture._\r\n\r\n1. Three to four weeks after the yeast culture has been added to the \r\ncider prepare the Acetic Culture in precisely the same manner as \r\ndescribed for the yeast in paragraphs 1 to 6 above. See that all of \r\nthe culture is removed from the bottle; rinse with a little cooled \r\nboiled water if necessary. Do not shake the jar while the culture is \r\ndeveloping.\r\n\r\n2. By the end of one to two weeks, a white, gelatinous film or \r\nmembrane should be visible on the surface of the liquid. This is a \r\ngrowth of acetic acid bacteria and constitutes the \"Mother of \r\nVinegar.\"\r\n\r\n3. When this acetic membrane is well formed, which will require about \r\ntwo weeks, with a clean sliver of wood, previously dipped into \r\nboiling water, remove the membrane from the jar, but do not lay it \r\ndown; pour the contents of the jar into the barrel of cider, now \r\nfermented, to which the yeast was added some five or six weeks \r\nbefore; next drop the sliver with the attached acetic film into the \r\nbarrel through the bung-hole. The wood will serve to float the acetic \r\nmembrane on the surface of the hard cider and thereby hasten its \r\ndevelopment by keeping it in contact with the air.\r\n\r\n4. Keep the barrel at 65 degrees F. to 75 degrees F. till the vinegar \r\nhas formed.\r\n\r\n5. When vinegar of satisfactory quality has been obtained, in three \r\nto six months, draw off and store at a cool, even temperature in \r\ncasks which are kept full and tightly bunged.\r\n\r\n6. Both of these cultures can be propagated indefinitely by employing \r\na small portion of the jar cultures in the same manner as the \r\noriginal bottle starters.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRANSCRIBER'S NOTES:\r\n\r\n1.
