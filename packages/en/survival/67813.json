STAFF OF LIFE\r\n\r\n\r\nWith his nephews as willing companions and eager listeners, Uncle Paul\r\ncontinued his walks and talks in the pleasant summer afternoons.\r\n\r\n“Bread is made of flour,” he began, “and flour is wheat reduced to\r\npowder under the millstone. What an interesting mechanism that is, the\r\nflour-mill, driven by water, by the wind, sometimes by steam! What\r\nwearisome effort, what waste of time, if we had not this invention and\r\nwere forced to do its work of grinding by sheer strength of arm!\r\n\r\n“I must tell you that in ancient times, for want of knowing how to\r\ngrind wheat, people had to content themselves with crushing it between\r\ntwo stones after parching it a little over the fire. The coarse meal\r\nthus obtained was cooked in water to a sort of porridge and eaten with\r\nno further preparation. Bread was unknown.\r\n\r\n“Later the plan was hit upon of kneading the meal with water and of\r\ncooking the dough between two hot stones. Thus was obtained a crude\r\nsort of biscuit, about as thick as your finger, stodgy and hard, and\r\nmixed with charcoal and ashes. It was preferable to the porridge, the\r\ninsipid paste, of the earlier time, but far inferior to the poorest\r\nbread of to-day. To make a long story short, by trial after trial\r\nsuccess was at last attained in the making of bread like ours. It\r\nbecame necessary then, without possessing anything to compare with our\r\nmills, to grind wheat in large quantities.\r\n\r\n“Flour was obtained by triturating the wheat in a hollowed stone with a\r\npestle. This latter was sometimes light enough to be operated directly\r\nby hand; sometimes, to produce quicker results, it was so large and\r\nheavy that it had to be turned in its stone mortar with the help of a\r\nlong bar. Such was the first mill. With appliances of this sort I leave\r\nyou to imagine how long a time was required for the production of a\r\nsingle handful of flour. For bread enough to feed one person at one\r\nmeal, wretched slaves were kept toiling from morning till night and\r\nfrom night till morning in turning the pestle.”\r\n\r\n“What cruel masters they must have had!” exclaimed Emile.\r\n\r\n“Yes, the slaves were harnessed to the bar like beasts of burden; and\r\nwhen, weakened with fatigue, they did not go fast enough, a rawhide was\r\napplied to their bare shoulders. These unfortunate millers were poor\r\nwretches taken in war and afterward sold in the market with the same\r\nindifference with which a drover sells his cattle. Such, then, were the\r\nhardships that led the way to the modern mill which to-day, with a few\r\nturns of its water-wheel, and to the cheerful accompaniment of its\r\ntick-tack, can make flour enough for a whole family.\r\n\r\n“But let us leave the mill and turn our attention to the following\r\ninteresting experiment. Take a handful of flour and with a little water\r\nmake it into dough. This done, knead the dough with your fingers over a\r\nlarge plate while an assistant moistens it continually with water from\r\na pitcher. Keep the dough well in hand and continue kneading it,\r\nflattening it out and gathering it together again, turning it over and\r\nover under the fine stream of water poured from above.\r\n\r\n“Examine carefully the water that passes over the dough and washes it.\r\nIt falls into the plate as white as milk, showing that it carries with\r\nit something from the flour. This something will finally settle at the\r\nbottom of the liquid, and we shall find it to be a substance not unlike\r\nthe starch used for starching linen. In fact, it is starch, or fecula,\r\nas the chemists call it—neither more nor less. The starch used in the\r\nlaundry is obtained in considerable quantities by similar means: dough\r\nis washed and the whitened water, left undisturbed, deposits a layer of\r\nstarch which has only to be gathered together and dried. [1]\r\n\r\n“So much, then, is made clear: flour contains starch, but it contains\r\nsomething else also. There is a limit beyond which the washed dough\r\nyields no more starch; it is useless to knead it, the water falls\r\ncolorless into the plate. What remains in one’s hands after this\r\nprolonged washing is a soft, gluey substance, having something of the\r\nelastic quality of rubber. Grayish in color, it has a rather pronounced\r\nodor. When dried in the sun, it becomes hard and translucent like horn.\r\nIt is called gluten from its gluelike character, its viscosity.\r\n\r\n“Now this substance, so unattractive in appearance, all soft and sticky\r\nand getting clogged between the fingers—this gluten, in short—do you\r\nknow what it is? Don’t try to dispute me, for what I am going to tell\r\nyou is the exact truth. In its composition gluten does not differ from\r\nflesh. It is vegetable flesh, capable of becoming animal flesh by the\r\nsimple process of digestion, without any material loss or gain.\r\nTherefore it is gluten, first and foremost, that gives to bread its\r\ngreat nutritive value.\r\n\r\n“Of all the cereals wheat contains the most gluten, with rye holding\r\nsecond place. Maize and rice, as well as chestnuts and potatoes, are\r\nwholly lacking in this ingredient; and for that reason flour made from\r\nthem, rich though it be in starch, is not at all the kind of flour for\r\nbread. This will explain to you the superiority of wheat over all other\r\nfarinaceous grains.\r\n\r\n“Wheat, the only cereal that can give us white bread, that superior\r\nbread which nevertheless is not always to your taste unless spread with\r\na little butter, does not grow in all countries. Open your atlas and\r\nrun over with your finger the countries bordering on the Mediterranean;\r\nyour travels will embrace the principal regions where wheat flourishes.\r\nFarther north it is too cold for the successful culture of the precious\r\ncereal; farther south it is too warm.\r\n\r\n“But that is not all. In the privileged regions not every district is\r\nadapted to this incomparable crop: wheat needs the mild temperature and\r\nfertile soil of the plains, not the harsh climate and dry slopes of the\r\nmountains. Let us consider France in particular. Its plains produce\r\nexcellent wheat, but not enough to feed the entire population;\r\ntherefore in the hilly and cooler regions, where this cereal cannot be\r\nraised, recourse is had in the first place to rye, which yields a bread\r\nthat is compact, brown, and heavy, but on the whole preferable to any\r\nother except, of course, wheat. This rye bread is the customary food of\r\nthe country in the greater number of our departments.\r\n\r\n“The raising of rye becomes in its turn impossible in regions too cold\r\nand too sterile. There then remains, as a last resort, barley, the\r\nhardiest of cereals, which is found in the mountains until we reach the\r\nneighborhood of perpetual snow, and can be raised even in the frigid\r\nclimate of the extreme North.\r\n\r\n“You ought to taste the miserable bread made from barley in order to\r\nfind our bread good—or, I might better say, in order to find it an\r\nexquisite dainty even without butter or jam. Barley bread is full of\r\nlong bristles that stick in the throat; it contains more bran than\r\nflour; it is bitter, stodgy, and of a disagreeable odor. Oh, what sorry\r\nstuff! And yet many have to be content with it, and are only glad if\r\nthey can get enough of it.\r\n\r\n“In the greater part of the world wheat, widely distributed by\r\ncommerce, furnishes bread only for the tables of the rich. The rest of\r\nthe population knows nothing, as a rule, of this article of food, has\r\nnever so much as seen it, and at most has only heard of it as a rare\r\ncuriosity. In place of bread the people eat here one thing, there\r\nanother, according to the country. Asia has rice, Africa millet,\r\nAmerica maize. In India and China the people have hardly anything to\r\neat but rice boiled in water with a little salt. Half the entire world\r\nhas practically the same diet.\r\n\r\n“The plant that produces rice has a stalk resembling that of wheat, but\r\ninstead of ending in an upright ear it bears a cluster of feeble and\r\npendent branches, all loaded with seeds. The leaves are narrow and\r\nribbon-shaped, rough to the touch. This plant is aquatic. In order to\r\nflourish, it must send down its roots into the submerged mud and spread\r\nits foliage, excepting the tip, in the flood. Marshy shallows,\r\ninundated a part of the year, are adapted to its cultivation.”\r\n\r\n“But what do they do where there are no such marshes?” asked Louis.\r\n\r\n“When such marshes are lacking, the ingenious Chinaman floods the\r\nlowlands with water from some near-by stream until the ground is all\r\nsoft and muddy. He then draws off the water through a series of little\r\ncanals, and works the mud with a light plow drawn by a buffalo, a kind\r\nof ox with a long beard hanging from its chin and a mane waving on its\r\nback.\r\n\r\n“The seed once sown in the furrows and the young plants started, the\r\nwater from the stream is again made to flood the fields, where it\r\nremains until harvest time. Then for the second time it is drawn off,\r\nand the reaper, sickle in hand and with the black mud up to his knees,\r\ncuts down the rice-laden tops of the stalks.\r\n\r\n“Maize, or Indian corn, is the staple food of South America, as rice is\r\nthat of Asia. Many call it Turkish wheat, a name doubly inappropriate,\r\nfor in the first place this grain is not indigenous to Turkey, but to\r\nAmerica, and in the second place it has nothing in common with the\r\nwheat from which bread is made. From America its cultivation has spread\r\nto our part of the globe.\r\n\r\n“The ear of maize is very large and is composed of full, rounded\r\nkernels, yellow and shiny, closely packed in regular rows. Like rice,\r\nmaize furnishes a fine flour of pleasing appearance but lacking in one\r\nessential: it contains no gluten. Hence the utter impossibility of\r\nusing either rice or maize for making bread, despite the good\r\nappearance of the flour made from them.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless maize is a very wholesome article of food, and one of\r\ngreat value in the country, where the appetite is sharpened by open air\r\nand hard work. Only it is not in the form of bread that it best yields\r\nits nourishment, but rather in that of porridge, or boiled meal and\r\nwater.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF TOBACCO\r\n\r\n\r\n“Before taking the form of the powder which the user of snuff pushes up\r\ninto his nose to tickle his nostrils and promote sneezing, before being\r\nrolled into the cigar or reduced to that crisp, moss-like substance\r\nwhich the smoker stuffs into his pipe, tobacco has had a previous\r\nexistence as a plant bearing this same name. A stalk about one meter in\r\nheight, large, clammy leaves of a strong odor, bright red flowers each\r\nshaped like a narrow funnel and expanding into the five points of a\r\nstar at the orifice, dry capsules filled with innumerable little\r\nseeds—there you have the tobacco plant.\r\n\r\n“Only the leaves are used, and these only after undergoing certain\r\nprocesses that intensify their natural properties and cause them to\r\nlose their green color. Rolled into compact little cylinders, they\r\nbecome cigars; cut very fine, they take the form of smoking tobacco.\r\nReduced to powder, they furnish what is known as snuff.\r\n\r\n“America, the same land to which we owe the potato, also gave us\r\ntobacco. When, almost four centuries ago, Christopher Columbus\r\ndiscovered the new world, one of the first landings he made was on the\r\nlarge island of Cuba. Apprehensive of danger in the forests from the\r\nsavage tribes on every side, Columbus sent scouts ahead to reconnoitre\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n“The sailors forming this party encountered on the way, to their\r\nextreme surprise, numerous Indians, both men and women, holding each a\r\nsort of lighted fire-brand between the teeth and inhaling the smoke.\r\nThese fire-brands, called ‘tabagos,’ were made of a plant rolled up in\r\na dry leaf. There, then, were the first smokers and the first cigars\r\nrecorded in history.\r\n\r\n“The natives of Cuba and the neighboring islands had, we infer, been\r\naddicted to smoking for a long time, probably for centuries, when the\r\nEuropeans first appeared among them. They had their rolls of dry\r\nleaves, or tabagos, and their smoking appliances of soft stone or baked\r\nclay, appliances called by us ‘pipes’ and by them ‘calumets.’ Tobacco,\r\nin fact, played a prominent part in their medicine, their superstitious\r\nobservances, and their political assemblies.\r\n\r\n“Consulted as to future events, the soothsayer first of all inhaled the\r\nsmoke of several tabagos, while the other persons present, seated in a\r\ncircle, vied with one another in the energy of their smoking, their\r\nultimate object being to enwrap themselves in a dense cloud. Then from\r\nthe midst of this cloud the soothsayer, his imagination wrought to a\r\nhigh pitch by the fumes of the tobacco, delivered his oracles in\r\nunwonted terms that made the hearers believe they were listening to the\r\nvoice of God.\r\n\r\n“A like ceremony was observed in the assemblies held for discussing\r\npublic affairs. Seated on a stone and inhaling the smoke from his\r\ncalumet, the orator who was about to take the floor waited in passive\r\nsilence while the chiefs of the nation approached him, one at a time,\r\nto blow into his face plenteous puffs from their pipes and to commend\r\nto him the interests of the tribe. These fumigations concluded, the\r\norator abandoned himself to his eloquence amid the enthusiastic acclaim\r\nof the assembly.\r\n\r\n“Seeing the islanders smoking, Columbus’s companions wished to try this\r\nsingular custom for themselves. To the gratification of this desire the\r\nIndian lent his ready assistance: he showed them how the tabago is\r\nrolled, and how the calumet is filled and lighted. Though history is\r\nsilent on the subject, it is clear that the first sailor to undertake\r\nthe inhalation must have been seized with that fearful nausea which no\r\nnovice in smoking can escape. A stomach of any delicacy would have been\r\nforever repelled; the harsh gullet of the mariner found a certain charm\r\nin the thing when once the trying experiences of initiation were over.\r\n\r\n“The taste for smoking was so soon acquired that, on their return to\r\nSpain, the companions of Columbus very quickly extended this Indian\r\ncustom in their own country. Before long, too, there was discovered a\r\nnew way to use tobacco: some one conceived the idea of reducing the\r\nleaf to a dry powder and stuffing it into the nostrils, sniffing with\r\neach pinch of the powdered substance. The Indian had discovered smoking\r\ntobacco; the European in his turn invented snuff.\r\n\r\n“Spain and Portugal numbered their smokers and snuff-takers by the\r\nthousand when, in 1560, tobacco made its first appearance in France.\r\nNicot, French ambassador at Lisbon, sent as an object of curiosity to\r\nhis sovereign queen, Catherine de Médicis, some seeds of the\r\nfashionable plant and a box of tobacco in powdered form. Charmed with\r\nthis gift, the queen quickly contracted the habit of taking snuff. To\r\nplease her, tobacco was cultivated, and snuff-takers soon became\r\nnumerous in all the provinces. It was said that a certain great\r\npersonage of the period took as much as three ounces daily. He\r\ncertainly must have had his nose well tanned.\r\n\r\n“From one nation to another the use of tobacco gradually spread, but\r\nnot without serious opposition. The Turks are to-day passionately\r\naddicted to smoking, extremely fond of their long pipes; yet hear what\r\nsort of a reception they at first gave to tobacco. Against smokers and\r\nsnuff-takers their emperor, Amurat, issued an edict severe to the point\r\nof cruelty. Every delinquent was condemned to receive fifty strokes\r\nwith the rod on the soles of his feet.”\r\n\r\n“That ought to have driven tobacco out of the country in short order,”\r\nremarked Jules.\r\n\r\n“That was merely a warning to first offenders,” returned his uncle.\r\n“For a second offense the luckless person caught in the act had his\r\nnose cut off. It was a radical measure to discourage the snuff-taker:\r\nno more nose, no more snuff. But the smokers, after this horrible\r\nmutilation, persisted in their smoking.\r\n\r\n“A king of Persia devised what he thought would cure even this habit:\r\nevery one caught with a pipe in his mouth had his upper lip cut off. At\r\nthe same time, of course, every nose proved guilty of snuff-taking fell\r\nunder the executioner’s knife. But the atrocious edict of the Persian\r\nking proved as futile as that of the Turkish emperor. Despite all the\r\nnoses struck off, all the lips cut away, all the feet made to tingle\r\nunder the rod, the use of tobacco still continued to spread. These\r\nfruitless severities had to be abandoned.\r\n\r\n“Other regulations sprang up here and there, less cruel, but\r\nsufficiently fruitful in fines, imprisonments, vexations of all sorts.\r\nStill nothing was of any avail; smokers and snuff-takers remained\r\nincorrigible. Finally, taking wiser counsel, the government authorities\r\nconceived a plan for making this passion, which no severity had been\r\nable to subdue, yield them large revenues. The government itself became\r\nexclusive vender of the very article it had at first proscribed with\r\nsuch rigor. France alone derives a yearly revenue of almost three\r\nhundred million francs from the sale of tobacco.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF FERTILE SOIL\r\n\r\n\r\n“Fertile or arable soil,” resumed Uncle Paul, “constitutes only the\r\nsurface layer of earth, that which is worked by the farmer’s implements\r\nand yields nutriment to the roots of plants and promotes their\r\ndevelopment. In one place you will see bare rocks and utter barrenness;\r\nin another you find fertile soil to a depth of an inch or two, scantily\r\ncarpeted with grass; and again, in a third, you come upon rich earth so\r\ndeep as to maintain abundant vegetation. But nowhere does this fertile\r\nlayer have an indefinite thickness: at a depth never very considerable\r\na subsoil having the qualities of the neighboring mountains is sure to\r\nbe found. How then has there come to be formed this layer of earth\r\nwhence is derived all the nutriment required by plants, animals, and\r\nmen?\r\n\r\n“Undermined all winter, and even the whole year round on high\r\nmountains, by the ice that forms in their slightest fissures, rocks of\r\nall kinds break into small fragments, divide into grains of sand, fall\r\ninto dust, and furnish the powdery mineral matter which the rain washes\r\naway and deposits in the valleys. This as a rule is the origin of\r\nbroken stones, sand, clay, and fertile soil. Ice by its expansive force\r\nhas detached them from the tops of mountains and the waters have swept\r\nthem away and carried them further. One can form an idea of the action\r\nof ice in crumbling rocks to make soil of them and enrich the valleys,\r\nby examining the surface of a hard road at the moment of thawing.\r\n\r\nFirm underfoot before freezing, this surface loses its firmness after a\r\nthaw and is pushed up here and there in little finely-powdered clods.\r\nAt the moment of freezing, the humidity with which the soil was\r\nimpregnated turned into ice which, increasing in volume, reduced to\r\nfine particles the surface layer of the road. When the thaw comes,\r\nthese particles which the ice no longer holds together form first mud,\r\nthen dust. In exactly this manner arable land was formed by the\r\ndisintegration of rocks of all kinds, which were reduced to particles\r\nby the action of frost.\r\n\r\nBut soil suitable for agriculture contains not only powdery mineral\r\nmatter, but also a little mold from the decomposition of vegetable\r\nmatter. To give you an idea of the causes which from the very earliest\r\ntimes have little by little fertilized this rock-dust with vegetable\r\nmold, let us take the following example.\r\n\r\nGeography has taught you what a volcano is. It is a mountain whose\r\nsummit is hollowed out in an immense funnel-shaped excavation called a\r\ncrater. From time to time the ground trembles near a volcano and\r\nformidable noises similar to the rolling of thunder and the booming of\r\ncannon are heard from the depths of the mountain. The crater throws up\r\ninto the air a lofty column of smoke, dark by day, fiery red at night.\r\nAll at once the mountain is rent and vomits up through the crevices a\r\nstream of fire, a current of melted rock, or lava. Finally the volcano\r\nquiets down; the source of the terrible flood dries up. The streams of\r\nlava harden and cease running; and after a lapse of time which may be\r\nyears they become quite cold. Now what is to become of this enormous\r\nbed of black stone similar in character to the slag from a forge? What\r\nwill this sheet of lava covering an area of several square miles\r\nproduce?\r\n\r\n“This desolate, blasted expanse seems destined never to be clothed with\r\nverdure. But in any such assumption one would be mistaken. After\r\ncenturies and centuries a vigorous growth of oaks, beeches, and other\r\nlarge trees will have taken root there. In fact, you will see that air,\r\nrain, snow, and, above all, frost attack in turn the hard surface of\r\nthe lava, detach fine particles from it, and slowly produce a little\r\ndust at its expense. On this dust there will spring into being certain\r\nstrange and hardy plants, those white or yellow patches, those\r\nvegetable incrustations, calculated to live on the surface of stone and\r\nknown as lichens. These lichens fasten themselves to the lava, gnaw it\r\nstill more, and in dying leave a little mold formed from their decaying\r\nremains. On this precious mold, lodged in some cavity of the lava,\r\nthere is now a growth of mosses which perish in their turn and increase\r\nthe quantity of fertilizing material. Next come ferns, which require a\r\nricher soil, and after that a few tufts of grass; then some brambles,\r\nsome meager shrubs; and thus with each succeeding year the fertile soil\r\nis added to from the new remnants of lava and mold left by the\r\npreceding generation of plants that have gone to decay. It is in this\r\nway that gradually a lava-bed finally becomes covered with a forest.\r\n\r\n“Our own arable land had a similar origin. Sterile rocks, hard as they\r\nare, contributed the mineral part by being reduced to dust through the\r\ncombined action of water, air, and frost; and the successive\r\ngenerations of plant-life, beginning with the simplest, furnished the\r\nmold.\r\n\r\n“Notice how admirably, in the processes of nature, the smallest of\r\ncreated beings perform their part and contribute as best they can to\r\nthe general harmony. To produce fertile soil there is needed something\r\nmore than the frosts and thaws that crumble the hardest rock: there is\r\nneed of plants hardy enough to live on this sterile soil, such as tough\r\ngrasses, mosses, lichens, which gnaw the stone. It is through the\r\nmedium of these rudimentary plants, so pitiful in appearance and yet so\r\nhardy, that the dust of the rocks is enriched with mold and converted\r\ninto a soil capable of bearing other and more delicate plants.\r\n\r\n“It is not in cultivated fields that you will find those thick carpets\r\nof mosses and lichens, valiant disintegrators of stone; it is on the\r\nmountain-tops that they can be seen at their work of crusting over the\r\nsmooth rock in order to convert it into fertile soil. It is from these\r\nheights that this fertile soil has descended, little by little, washed\r\ndown by the rain, until it has fertilized the valleys. This work is\r\ngoing on all the time; in hilly regions plants of the lowest order are\r\nconstantly adding to the extent of arable land. The little threads of\r\nrain-water that furrow these regions carry away with them some of this\r\nhumus and bear it to the plains below.\r\n\r\n“What a worthy subject for our thoughtful study is this formation of\r\narable soil by these legions of inferior plants, obscure workers\r\nindefatigably crumbling the rock! What immense results obtained by the\r\nsimplest means!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT KINDS OF SOIL\r\n\r\n\r\n“Four substances, mingled in very variable proportions, enter into the\r\ncomposition of fertile soil, or arable land, namely: sand or silica,\r\nclay, limestone, and humus, or vegetable mold. Each one of these\r\ningredients separately would make but very poor soil, quite unsuited\r\nfor agriculture; but united, mixed together, they fulfill the\r\nconditions necessary to fertility. Arable land generally contains all\r\nfour, with the predominance sometimes of one, sometimes of another. The\r\nsoil takes the name of its most abundant constituent. Thus have arisen\r\nthe names, silicious soil, argillaceous soil, calcareous soil, and\r\nhumous soil, to designate the fertile lands dominated respectively by\r\nsand, clay, limestone, and humus. Compound terms are also used. For\r\nexample, when it is said of a certain soil that it is\r\nargillo-calcareous, it is meant that clay and limestone are its chief\r\nconstituents.\r\n\r\n“Sand consists of particles, more or less minute, of very hard rock,\r\nsometimes opaque, sometimes as transparent as glass, and always easily\r\nrecognizable by its property of emitting sparks when struck with steel.\r\nFlint and white pebbles belong to this kind of rock, which is called\r\nsilex, silica, or quartz. These three expressions mean about the same.\r\nSandy soils have little consistency, are easily permeated by water, and\r\nfreely absorb the sun’s heat, which makes them very subject to drought.\r\n\r\n“The name of granite is given to a rock composed chiefly of silica and\r\nwhich forms whole mountains, as in central France and in Brittany. The\r\nsoil formed by the gradual disintegration of this rock is sometimes\r\ncalled granite soil. It is not very good for agriculture. Chestnut\r\ntrees prosper in it, as well as certain wild plants characteristic of\r\nthis kind of land. The principal ones are the various species of\r\nheather and the purple digitalis. Heather, with its dainty little pink\r\nblossoms, carpets in richest abundance the poorest of sandy soils. The\r\npurple digitalis is a large-leaved plant whose flowers, red on the\r\noutside, striped with purple and white inside, are arranged in a long\r\nand magnificent distaff reaching almost to the height of a man. The\r\nflowers are in the shape of long tun-bellied bells or, rather,\r\nglove-fingers; hence the plant is sometimes called foxglove, sometimes\r\nlady’s fingers.\r\n\r\n“The soil composed of substances thrown up by volcanoes is also sandy,\r\nand is called volcanic soil. It is generally black and sometimes very\r\nfertile.\r\n\r\n“Sandy-clay soil is found in the valleys of great rivers. It is the\r\nmost fruitful and the easiest to cultivate. Such are the soils of the\r\nRhone valley, the valley of the Loire, and that of the Seine. It is\r\nstill more fertile if it is flooded by the stream at high water. Then\r\nthe river deposits a rich slime composed of clay and organic matter\r\nwashed down by the current.\r\n\r\n“The soil of heathy or shrubby land is composed of fine sand and of\r\nhumus from the decayed leaves of heather and other plants. It is only\r\nused for flower gardens, and furnishes an example of what might be\r\ncalled sand-and-humus soil.\r\n\r\n“Clay is a soil which, when moistened with water and thoroughly\r\nkneaded, becomes a soft and tenacious dough, suitable for molding into\r\nany desired shape. When perfectly pure it is white, and is known as\r\nkaolin, a rare substance of which porcelain is made. Plastic clays are\r\nthose that are unctuous to the touch, forming with water a yielding\r\nmass that hardens with firing. They are used in making pottery.\r\nSmectite, or fuller’s earth, is a clay of very different character, not\r\npliable when moistened, but very absorbent of grease and hence used by\r\nfullers for cleansing cloth of the oil left on it in weaving. Ochres\r\nare clays colored either red or yellow by iron-rust. They are used in\r\ncoarse painting. Red chalk belongs to this class of clays. Marl is a\r\nmixture in variable proportions of clay and limestone. According to\r\nwhich constituent predominates, it is called argillaceous or\r\ncalcareous. Subjected to the action of air and moisture, marl becomes\r\nflaky and crumbles to dust. Marl is used in agriculture to improve the\r\nsoil.\r\n\r\n“A clay soil is quite the opposite of a sandy soil: water makes it\r\nswell and converts it into a sticky paste which clings tenaciously to\r\nfarming implements. Once wet, it is cold, that is to say it dries very\r\nslowly. A spade can only divide it into dense clods slow to crumble in\r\nthe air and not fit for receiving seed. The farmer must be careful to\r\ndrain off the water and break up the ground by working it before and\r\nduring frosts. It is improved by mixing with it sand, coal-ashes, and\r\nlime. Wheat flourishes better in a clayey soil than in any other kind.\r\n\r\n“Clayey soils are recognized by their vegetation. The wild plants\r\npeculiar to this kind of soil are colt’s-foot and danewort. Colt’s-foot\r\nis also called horse-foot from the shape of its leaves, the outline of\r\nwhich reminds one of a horse’s hoof. The leaves are white underneath.\r\nThe flowers are yellow like little marigolds, and they appear at the\r\nbeginning of spring before the leaves. Danewort is a kind of herbaceous\r\nelder of about half the height of a man. Its small white flowers are\r\nsucceeded by berries full of a violet-red juice.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT KINDS OF SOIL\r\n\r\n(Continued)\r\n\r\n\r\n“Limestone is the rock from which lime is obtained. It is composed of\r\ncarbonic acid and lime. To obtain the latter, the limestone is\r\nsubjected to intense heat in a furnace or lime-kiln. The carbonic acid\r\nescapes, is dissipated in the air, and only the lime remains. In arable\r\nland limestone is found rather often in smaller or larger pieces, but\r\nmore frequently as a fine powder which the eye can scarcely distinguish\r\nfrom the other constituents, especially clay. The water of rivers and\r\nother streams almost always contains a small proportion of dissolved\r\nlimestone. Thence comes the thin layer of stone that accumulates little\r\nby little on the inner surface of bottles, coating the glass. Some\r\nwaters contain enough of this dissolved limestone to deposit a mineral\r\ncrust on objects immersed in them, as mosses and aquatic plants, and to\r\nobstruct their aqueducts. The clearest water, in which no foreign\r\nsubstance can be seen, absolutely none, nevertheless contains dissolved\r\nlimestone, just as sweetened water contains invisible sugar. In\r\ndrinking a glass of water we drink a little stone at the same time. Our\r\nbody, in order to grow strong and increase in size, needs considerable\r\ncalcareous matter for the formation of bones, which are to us what its\r\nsolid framework is to a building. This material, so necessary to us, is\r\nnot created by us; we obtain it from our food and drink. Water plays\r\nits part in furnishing this limestone, which it furnishes also to\r\nplants; they all contain a greater or less proportion of this mineral\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\n“Calcareous soils are whitish from their chief constituent, chalk.\r\nEntirely sterile when the proportion of limestone is excessive, they\r\nare tolerably productive when clay is added. They are especially\r\nsuitable for vineyards and for raising lucerne, sainfoin, and clover.\r\nChampagne and the south of France offer examples of this kind of soil.\r\nIts principal varieties are chalky soil, which is nearly sterile,\r\ncontaining as much as ninety-five per cent of chalk, and marly soil\r\nwhich is composed of clay and chalk.\r\n\r\n“The plant-life characteristic of calcareous soils comprises the\r\nbox-tree, whose compact and fine-grained wood is so esteemed by\r\nturners; the wild cornel, whose red, olive-shaped fruit is one of the\r\nbest-liked autumn products that nature offers us; and the alkekengi, or\r\nwinter cherry, whose yellow berries are used for coloring butter. These\r\nberries are encased in a large, gorgeously red membranous bag.\r\n\r\n“Wood, leaves, herbage, left a long time in contact with air and\r\nmoisture, undergo a slow combustion; in other words, they rot. The\r\nresult of this decomposition is a brown substance called humus or\r\nvegetable mold. The heart of old hollow willows is converted into\r\nhumus; it is the same with leaves that fall from the trees and rot on\r\nthe ground. Humus from the remains of earlier generations of plant-life\r\nnourishes the plant-life of to-day, and this in turn will become mold\r\nfrom which future plants will spring. It is in this way that vegetation\r\nis maintained in places not cultivated by man. Humus, then, is nature’s\r\nmanure. Where it is allowed to form freely, vegetation never loses its\r\nvigor, using over and over again the same material, which takes\r\nalternately the two forms of plant and humus. But hay from the field is\r\nstored in the hay-loft, and the annual harvest of wheat is taken to the\r\ngranary. Thus the land is robbed of the mold that would be formed\r\nnaturally by the rotting of this hay and wheat; therefore we must give\r\nback to it, under some form or other, this mold that has been taken\r\naway, since otherwise the soil will become less and less productive\r\nuntil finally it is quite sterile. This restitution is made in the form\r\nof animal manure, which is a sort of humus produced by digestive\r\nprocesses instead of by natural decay.\r\n\r\n“Humus plays a twofold part in the soil. First, it mellows the land, or\r\nin other words makes it more easily permeable by air and water.\r\nSecondly, by the slow combustion taking place in the humus there is\r\nconstantly being liberated a small quantity of carbonic acid gas, which\r\nis taken up by the adjacent roots. Agriculture can succeed only in so\r\nfar as the soil contains humus. Wheat requires nearly eight per cent,\r\noats and rye only two per cent. In poor, sandy soils, to increase the\r\namount of vegetable mold, it is customary to plow certain green crops\r\nunder, as the farmers express it; that is, the surface soil is turned\r\nover and the growing crop intended for manuring purposes is buried and\r\nleft to decay in the ground. That is what is done when the plowman\r\nturns under a field of growing grass or a stretch of clover. When it is\r\nproposed to improve a piece of land by this process, it is the practice\r\nto begin by raising a crop (which will later be turned under) that\r\nderives the greater part of its nourishment from the air, since the\r\nsoil in this instance cannot of itself furnish this nourishment. Among\r\nthe plants satisfying these conditions are buckwheat, clover, lupine,\r\nbeans, vetches, lucerne, and sainfoin.\r\n\r\n“Soils rich in humus have for their chief constituent the brown\r\nsubstance that results from the decaying of leaves and other vegetable\r\nmatter. Turf land stands first as rich in humus. Turf is a dark, spongy\r\nsubstance that forms in moist lowlands from the accumulation of\r\nvegetable refuse, especially mosses. Turf, or peat, as it is also\r\ncalled, is used for fuel. To turn such a soil to account, it must first\r\nbe made wholesome by drainage, it must be mellowed by paring and\r\nburning and by the addition of sand and marl, and a proportion of lime\r\nmust be mixed in to hasten the decomposition of all vegetable matter.\r\nTurf lands are recognized by their sphagnei, great mosses that grow\r\nwith their roots in the water; and by their flax-like sedges, from the\r\ntops of which hang beautiful tufts of down having the softness and\r\nwhiteness of the finest silk.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nPOTASH AND PHOSPHORUS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Let us burn a plant, no matter what kind. The first effect of the heat\r\nis to produce carbon, which, mixed with other substances, constituted\r\nthe plant. If combustion continues, this carbon is dissipated in the\r\nair in the form of carbonic acid gas, and there remains an earthy\r\nresidue which we call ashes. Here then are two kinds of material,\r\ncarbon and ashes, which without exception enter into all plant-life.\r\nThe plant did not create them, did not make them out of nothing, since\r\nit is impossible to obtain something from nothing. It must, then, have\r\nderived them from some source. We shall take up before long the subject\r\nof coal and its origin, and shall find that it comes chiefly from the\r\natmosphere, whence the leaves obtain carbonic acid gas, which they\r\ndecompose under the action of the sun’s rays, retaining the carbon and\r\nthrowing off the air in a condition fit for breathing. The vegetation\r\nof the entire earth thus finds its principal nutriment in the\r\natmosphere, an inexhaustible and increasingly abundant reservoir,\r\nbecause the respiration of animals, putrefaction, and combustion are\r\ncontinually giving forth as much carbonic acid gas as the combined\r\nplant-life of the earth can consume. To maintain the fertility of his\r\nfields, therefore, the farmer need not give a thought to the subject of\r\ncarbon; with no assistance from him his growing crops find in the air\r\nall the carbonic acid gas they require. There remains for our\r\nconsideration, then, the residue left after combustion, the ashes in\r\nfact, a mixture of various substances of which we will now examine the\r\nmost important.\r\n\r\n“Let us put a few handfuls of ashes to boil in a pot of water. After\r\nboiling a little while we will let the contents cool. The ashes settle\r\nto the bottom and the liquid at the top becomes clear. Well, we shall\r\nfind this liquid emitting a peculiar odor, exactly like that which\r\ncomes from the lye obtained by passing water through a barrel of ashes.\r\nWe shall also find that it has an acrid, almost burning taste. This\r\nsmell of lye, this acrid taste were not in the water at first; they\r\ncome from the ashes, which have yielded a certain constituent to the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n“Hence we see that ashes must contain at least two substances of\r\ndifferent kinds, of which the principal one cannot dissolve in water,\r\nbut settles at the bottom as an earthy deposit, while the other,\r\nforming but a very small part of the whole, dissolves easily in water\r\nand gives it its properties, especially its odor and its acrid taste.\r\n\r\n“If we wish to obtain this latter element by itself, we can very easily\r\ndo so. All that is necessary is to put the clear liquid into a pot over\r\nthe fire and boil it until all the water has evaporated. There will be\r\nleft a very small quantity of whitish matter resembling table salt. But\r\ndespite its appearance it is not table salt by any means; far from it,\r\nas we shall quickly discover from its unbearable taste. It is known as\r\npotash, and it is what makes lye so good for cleaning linen.\r\nFurthermore, of the various components of ashes it is the one most\r\nessential to vegetation. Every tree, every shrub, every plant, even to\r\nthe smallest blade of grass, contains a certain proportion of it,\r\nsometimes larger, sometimes smaller, according to the kind of\r\nplant-life, and therefore must find it in the soil in order to thrive.\r\nLet us add that in growing plants potash is not as the action of fire\r\nleaves it after the plants have been reduced to ashes. In nature it is\r\ncombined with other substances which free it from that burning\r\nacridity. In the same way carbon, when combined with other elements,\r\nloses its blackness and hardness; in fact, it is no longer common coal.\r\n\r\n“What else is there in ashes? A short account of the matter will tell\r\nus. In 1669 there lived in Hamburg, Germany, a learned old man named\r\nBrandt, whose head was a little turned and who sought to turn common\r\nmetals into gold. From old iron, rusty nails, and worn-out kettles, he\r\nhoped to produce the precious metal. But he did not succeed in his\r\nendeavors, nor was it destined that he should succeed, for the simple\r\nreason that the thing is impossible. Never is one metal changed into\r\nanother. When he was about at the end of his resources he took it into\r\nhis head to conceive a crowning absurdity. He imagined that in urine\r\nwould be found the ingredient capable of turning all metals into gold.\r\nBehold him, then, boiling urine, evaporating it, and cooking the\r\ndisgusting sediment, first with this, then with that, until at last one\r\nevening he saw something shining in his phials. It was not gold, but\r\nsomething more useful: it was phosphorus, which to-day gives us fire.\r\nDon’t make fun of old Brandt and his foolish cooking: in seeking the\r\nimpossible he made one of the most important discoveries. To him we owe\r\nthe sulphur match, that precious source of light and fire so easily and\r\nquickly used.\r\n\r\n“If you examine a sulphur match you will see that the inflammable tip\r\ncontains two substances: sulphur, laid on to the wood, and another\r\nsubstance added to the sulphur. This last is phosphorus, colored with a\r\nblue, red, or brown powder, according to the caprice of the\r\nmanufacturer. Phosphorus by itself is slightly yellow in color and\r\ntranslucent like wax. Its name means ‘light-bearer.’ When rubbed gently\r\nbetween the fingers in the dark, it does indeed give out a pale gleam.\r\nAt the same time there is a smell of garlic; it is the odor of\r\nphosphorus. This substance is excessively inflammable: with very little\r\nheat or with slight friction against a hard surface, it catches fire.\r\nHence its use in the manufacture of matches.\r\n\r\n“Phosphorus is a horribly poisonous substance. By melting a little of\r\nit in grease a poison can be obtained that will destroy rats and mice.\r\nCrusts of bread are smeared with this composition and exposed in places\r\nfrequented by these animals. A nibble is enough to ensure speedy death.\r\nHence you perceive that because of their poisonous nature matches are\r\nto be handled with extreme care. Contact with food might produce the\r\ngravest consequences.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nPHOSPHATES AND NITROGEN\r\n\r\n\r\n“Phosphorus, which is a dangerous poison, as we have seen, is\r\nnevertheless found in abundance in the bodies of all animals. It occurs\r\nin the urine, whence Brandt was the first to extract it; it is found\r\nstill more plentifully in the bones, and from thence it is now\r\nobtained. There is some in meat, in milk, and in cheese; also in\r\nplants, notably cereals; hence flour and bread contain it. But do not\r\nbe alarmed: we shall not die of poison like the rats that have nibbled\r\ncrusts smeared with grease and phosphorus.”\r\n\r\n“But why not,” asked Emile, “if we eat it as the rats do?”\r\n\r\n“I will try to explain,” replied his uncle. “When two or more\r\nsubstances are mixed together, they lose their original properties,\r\nwhile the new substance obtained by their combination is found to\r\npossess new properties having nothing in common with the old ones. Thus\r\ncarbon, when combined with the air that we breathe, becomes an\r\ninvisible gas, subtle, and unfit for breathing. In like manner lime,\r\nburning to the taste, is converted by union with carbonic acid gas into\r\nchalk, a calcareous stone void of taste. Furthermore, poisonous\r\nsubstances, deadly in a very small dose, may become harmless and even\r\nenter into the composition of our food when they are combined with\r\nother substances. Thus it is with phosphorus. What, then, is united\r\nwith phosphorus in the form in which it ceases to be poisonous and\r\nenters into the composition of meat and flour? That is what we will now\r\nconsider.\r\n\r\n“When phosphorus is burned it produces a thick white smoke, of which\r\nyou can get some idea by striking a number of matches all at once. This\r\nwhite smoke with the slightest trace of humidity is reducible to an\r\nextraordinarily acid liquid called phosphoric acid. Since this compound\r\nresults from the combustion of phosphorus, just as carbonic acid is the\r\nresult of the combustion of carbon, it must and in fact does contain\r\nthe air without which no combustion can take place. Phosphoric acid is\r\nno longer inflammable, however much it may be heated; being itself the\r\nproduct of combustion, it cannot burn again. But if there is no danger\r\nof its catching fire, phosphoric acid is nevertheless dangerous on\r\naccount of its intense acidity, which makes it violently corrosive in\r\nits action on flesh. If mixed with lime, however, this formidable\r\ncompound loses its injurious properties and is changed into a white\r\nsubstance without the least taste or the slightest poisonous effect.\r\nThis substance is called phosphate of lime. Burnt phosphorus and lime,\r\nthus united, furnish the greater part of the mineral matter found in\r\nbones. Put a bone into the fire: the grease and juices that permeate\r\nits substance will be burnt up and the bone will lose a part of its\r\nweight and become friable and perfectly white. Well, this bone,\r\ncalcined in the fire for a long time, is composed chiefly of phosphate\r\nof lime. It contains phosphorus, the most combustible of substances,\r\nand yet is itself absolutely incombustible; it contains one of the most\r\npoisonous substances, and yet is itself quite harmless; into its\r\ncomposition there has entered an ingredient possessing atrocious\r\nacidity, and yet the compound itself has no taste. Similarly combined\r\nand equally harmless, phosphorus is found in meat, milk, cereals, in\r\nflour and bread.\r\n\r\n“A cow can furnish each week about 70 liters of milk containing 460\r\ngrams of phosphate. This phosphate comes from hay, which obtains it\r\nfrom the soil. But as the soil contains only a moderate quantity of it,\r\nand the hay continually takes it away, the supply will at last become\r\nexhausted and the milk will become poorer and less abundant. If a\r\nkilogram of powdered bones, containing about the same quantity of\r\nphosphate as the 70 liters of milk, is spread over the pasture, it will\r\nmake good the weekly loss in phosphate that the soil undergoes in the\r\nproduction of the cow’s milk. Hence the efficacy of powdered bones on\r\nexhausted pasture land.\r\n\r\n“Phosphoric acid combined with other substances is found in all our\r\nagricultural products, and hence the phosphate from bones has a very\r\nmarked effect on our crops. Harvests have been doubled as if by magic\r\nthrough the use of powdered bones. A kilogram of this powder contains\r\nenough phosphoric acid for the growth of a hundred kilograms of wheat.\r\nDespite their great value as a fertilizer bones will never be thus used\r\nexcept to a limited extent, because they are not abundant enough and\r\nalso because they are much in demand in various arts and manufactures.\r\nFortunately in some localities phosphate of lime is found in certain\r\ncoarse pebbles called nodules or coprolites. These precious stones are\r\ncarefully collected and ground to powder in a mill. Then, in order to\r\nmake the substance more soluble in damp soil, and thus better fitted\r\nfor the nutrition of plants, it is sprayed with an extremely corrosive\r\nliquid called sulphuric acid or, more commonly, oil of vitriol. In this\r\nway is obtained the superphosphate of lime which manufacture gives to\r\nagriculture as one of the most powerful of fertilizers, especially for\r\nthe raising of grain.\r\n\r\n“We were wondering a little while ago what substances could be\r\ncontained in the ashes of a burnt plant, and we have now found potash\r\nto be one of them. Moreover, since all vegetation must have phosphate\r\nin order to thrive, this also ought to be found in the ashes, phosphate\r\nbeing indestructible by heat. And, in fact, after the incineration of\r\nany vegetable matter whatever, as a bundle of hay or a handful of\r\ngrain, the delicate processes of science can always recover this\r\ncompound of phosphorus; and they further find lime, iron in the form of\r\nrust, the silicious component of pebbles, and divers other substances\r\nof less interest.\r\n\r\n“To finish this difficult but very important subject of the nutrition\r\nof plants, I must say a few words about ammonia. This word does not\r\ntell you anything since it is a new word to you. But I will make its\r\nmeaning clear to you by a familiar illustration.\r\n\r\n“You must have noticed the strong, penetrating odor prevalent in\r\nill-kept water-closets; and you have also perceived the same odor when\r\nsoiled garments are cleaned with a certain liquid that looks like clear\r\nwater. Well, this odor, so pungent that it almost produces the effect\r\nof fine needles thrust up into the nostrils and brings tears to the\r\neyes, is the odor of ammonia.\r\n\r\n“Ammonia is an invisible gas capable of being taken up in large\r\nquantities by water, the mixture being known as aqua ammoniæ, or water\r\nof ammonia. Combined with other substances ammonia loses its pungent\r\nodor and forms compounds which are among the most effective\r\nfertilizers. These compounds furnish vegetation with one of its\r\nessential ingredients called nitrogen. By itself nitrogen is an\r\nodorless and colorless gas. In this state it forms four-fifths of the\r\nvolume of ordinary air, the air we breathe. The other fifth is composed\r\nof a second gas called oxygen, also colorless and odorless. It is\r\noxygen that our lungs demand when we breathe, and it is oxygen that is\r\nnecessary when we wish to burn anything. It is this alone that plays\r\nits invaluable part in the combustion of certain substances in our\r\nblood and in the generation of natural heat; it is this that in the\r\nprocess of combustion releases carbon, phosphorus, sulphur, and other\r\ncombustibles, to combine with them and produce a compound known as\r\ncarbonic acid gas in the case of burnt carbon, phosphoric acid in the\r\ncase of phosphorus. In fact, to it belong the properties that we have\r\nuntil now attributed to the atmosphere as a whole. As for nitrogen, it\r\nhas no other purpose in the atmosphere than to moderate by its presence\r\nthe too violent energies of oxygen; it plays there the part of the\r\nwater that we put into too strong wine.\r\n\r\n“All vegetation requires nitrogen. Wheat, for example, must have it to\r\ndevelop the grain in the ear; peas, beans, lentils demand it in order\r\nto fill out their pods; the pasture and the hay-field need it if they\r\nare to furnish the nutriment that the sheep and the cow will transform\r\ninto milk. But plants cannot take this nitrogen from the air, where it\r\nis so abundant; it must be served up to them after a certain necessary\r\npreparation. We ourselves need phosphorus, since it enters into the\r\ncomposition of our bones; we need carbon still more, the principal fuel\r\nused in maintaining the heat of the body. But are we to eat the\r\ncharcoal that the charcoal-burner manufactures in his furnace, and the\r\nphosphorus used in the making of matches? Certainly not. The first\r\nwould be a frightful mouthful, the second an atrocious poison. We must\r\nhave them prepared in a suitable way, such as they are found in bread,\r\nmilk, meat, fruits, vegetables. In the same manner plant-life requires\r\nnitrogen, not as it occurs in the atmosphere, but as it exists in\r\ncertain combinations, of which the most notable are the compounds of\r\nammonia. This explains to us the highly beneficial effect of manure on\r\nour crops. Manure is composed of the bedding used in stables and the\r\nanimal excrement with which it has become mixed and impregnated. Now\r\nthis excrementitious matter, especially urine, yields ammonia in\r\ndecomposing, as is proved by the odor arising from latrines in hot\r\nweather and so powerfully affecting the eyes and nose. Thus manure may\r\nbe said to hold ammonia compounds in storage, and from them plants\r\nderive their nitrogen, as also many other ingredients.\r\n\r\n“Let us summarize these details. In the nutrition of plants four\r\nsubstances are of prime importance. First, carbonic acid gas, which\r\nyields carbon, the most widely diffused of all the elements (but which\r\nwe need not dwell upon here), since plants take it chiefly from the\r\natmosphere, to which it is supplied unceasingly. After carbonic acid\r\ncome potash, phosphoric acid, and nitrogen, all of which the roots\r\nextract from the soil, where it occurs in some compound or other. These\r\nare the ingredients that the soil, if it is to remain fertile, must\r\nhave given back to it as fast as they are exhausted by the crops. Such\r\nis the part played by fertilizers, without which the soil becomes\r\nexhausted and ceases to produce.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nVEGETATION AND THE ATMOSPHERE\r\n\r\n\r\n“The carbonic acid gas produced simply by the breathing of the great\r\nhuman family amounts every year to about 160,000,000,000 cubic meters,\r\nwhich represents 86,270,000,000 kilograms of burnt carbon. Piled up,\r\nthis carbon would form a mountain one league round at its base and\r\nbetween four hundred and five hundred meters high. So much carbon is\r\nrequired by man to maintain his natural heat. All of us together eat\r\nthis mountain of carbon in our food and in the course of the year\r\ndissipate it all in the air, a breathful at a time; after which we\r\nimmediately begin the dissipation of another mountain of carbon. How\r\nmany mountains of carbon, then, since the world was created, must\r\nmankind have exhaled into the atmosphere!\r\n\r\n“We must take account, too, of the animals, which, collectively, those\r\nof the land and those of the sea, use up a big mountain of combustible\r\nmatter. They are much more numerous than we; they inhabit the entire\r\nglobe, both continents and seas. What a quantity of carbon it must take\r\nto sustain the life of our planet! And to think that it all goes forth\r\ninto the air, as a deadly gas, of which a few breaths would cause\r\ndeath!\r\n\r\n“Nor is that all. Fermentation, as in grape-juice and rising dough, and\r\nputrefaction, as in decaying manure, produce carbonic acid gas. And it\r\nneeds only a light layer of manure to cause a cultivated field to give\r\nforth between one hundred and two hundred cubic meters of carbonic acid\r\ngas per day for each hectare.\r\n\r\n“The wood, coal, and charcoal burnt in our houses, and especially the\r\nquantities consumed in the great furnaces of factories—are not they\r\nalso returned to the atmosphere in the form of harmful gas? Just think\r\nof the amount of carbonic acid gas vomited into the atmosphere by a\r\nfactory furnace into which coal is poured by the carload! Think also of\r\nthe volcanoes, gigantic natural chimneys which in a single eruption\r\nthrow up such quantities of gas that furnaces offer no comparison. It\r\nis very clear: the atmosphere is constantly receiving carbonic acid gas\r\nin torrents that defy computation. And yet animal life has nothing to\r\nfear for the present or for the future, since the atmosphere, though\r\ncontinually being poisoned with carbonic acid gas, is at the same time\r\nalways being purged of it.\r\n\r\n“And what is the purgative agent commissioned by Providence to maintain\r\nthe salubrity of the atmosphere? It is vegetation, my friends,\r\nvegetation, which feeds on carbonic acid gas to prevent our perishing\r\nand turns it into the bread of life for our sustenance. This deadly\r\ngas, which absorbs into itself all sorts of putrefaction, is the\r\nchoicest of nourishment for plant-life; and thus out of the bosom of\r\ndeath the blade of grass builds up new life.\r\n\r\n“A leaf is riddled with an infinite number of excessively minute\r\norifices, each encircled by two lips which give it the appearance of a\r\nhalf-open mouth. They are called stomata. On a single leaf of the\r\nlinden more than a million can be counted, but so small are they as to\r\nbe quite invisible without a magnifying-glass. This picture shows you\r\nhow they look under a microscope. Well, through these orifices the\r\nplant breathes, not pure air such as we breathe, but poisoned air,\r\nfatal to an animal but wholesome for a plant. It inhales through its\r\nmyriads of millions of stomata the carbonic acid gas diffused through\r\nthe atmosphere; it admits this gas into the inner substance of its\r\nleaves, and there, under the sun’s rays, a marvelous process follows.\r\nStimulated by the light, the leaves operate upon the deadly gas and\r\ntake from it all its carbon. They unburn (the word is not in the\r\ndictionary, more’s the pity, for it gives the right idea)—they unburn\r\nthe burnt carbon, undo what combustion had done, separate the carbon\r\nfrom the air with which it is bound up; in a word, they decompose the\r\ncarbonic acid gas.\r\n\r\n“And do not think it any easy thing to unburn a burnt substance, to\r\nrestore to their original condition two substances united by fire.\r\nScientists would need all the ingenious means and powerful drugs they\r\npossess to extract carbon from carbonic acid gas. This task, which\r\nwould tax the utmost resources of the man of science, leaves accomplish\r\nnoiselessly, without effort, even instantaneously, and with the sole\r\nrequirement that they shall have the aid of the sun.\r\n\r\n“But if sunlight fails, the plant can do nothing with the carbonic acid\r\ngas, the chief item in its diet. It then pines away with hunger, shoots\r\nup as if in quest of the missing sunshine, while its bark and leaves\r\nturn pale and lose their green color. Finally it dies. This sickly\r\nstate induced by the absence of light is called etiolation. It is\r\nartificially produced in gardening for the purpose of obtaining\r\ntenderer vegetables and of lessening or even entirely removing the too\r\nstrong and unpleasant taste of some plants. In this way some salad\r\ngreens are bound with a rush so that the heart, deprived of the sun’s\r\nrays, may become tender and white; and thus, too, celery is banked up\r\nand left to whiten, since otherwise its taste would be unbearable. If\r\nwe cover grass with a tile or hide a plant under a pot turned upside\r\ndown, we shall after a few days of this enforced darkness find the\r\nfoliage all sickly and yellow.\r\n\r\n“When, on the other hand, the plant receives the sun’s rays without\r\nhindrance, the carbonic acid gas is decomposed in no time, the carbon\r\nand the air separate, and each resumes its original properties. Freed\r\nof its carbon, the air becomes what it was before this admixture: it\r\nbecomes pure air, fit to maintain both fire and life. In this state it\r\nis restored to the atmosphere by the stomata to be used again in\r\ncombustion and respiration. It entered the plant as a fatal gas, it\r\nleaves it as a vivifying gas. It will return some day with a new charge\r\nof carbon, which it will deposit in the plant, and then, restored to\r\npurity once more, it will recommence its atmospheric round. A swarm of\r\nbees goes and comes, from the hive to the fields and from the fields to\r\nthe hives, on one trip lightened and eager for booty and on the other\r\nheavily laden with honey and returning to the comb on wearied wing. In\r\nthe same way air on coming to the leaves is charged with carbon from an\r\nanimal’s body, a burning fire-brand, or decaying matter; it gives it to\r\nthe plant and departs for a fresh supply.\r\n\r\n“It is thus that the atmosphere preserves its salubrity despite the\r\nimmense torrents of carbonic acid that are cast into it. The plant\r\nlives on deadly gas. Under the action of the sun’s light it decomposes\r\nthe gas into carbon, which it keeps for building up its own substance,\r\nand breathable air, which it returns to the atmosphere. From this\r\ncarbon combined with other substances come wood, sugar, starch, flour,\r\ngum, resin, oil, in fact every kind of vegetable product. Animal and\r\nplant are of mutual assistance, the animal producing carbonic acid gas,\r\nwhich nourishes the plant, and the plant changing this deadly gas into\r\nair fit to breathe and into food. Thus our dependence on plants is\r\ntwofold: they purify the atmosphere and they give us food.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nLIME\r\n\r\n\r\nTo make mortar with which masonry is held in place it is customary to\r\nuse lime. In a sort of trough lined with sand are placed lumps of stone\r\nhaving a calcined appearance, and on these stones water is poured. In a\r\nfew moments the pile becomes heated to high temperature, cracks and\r\nsplits and finally crumbles into dust, at the same time absorbing the\r\nwater, which disappears little by little as it is taken up by the solid\r\nmatter or vaporized by the heat. More water is added to reduce it all\r\nto paste, which is finally mixed with sand. The product of the mixture\r\nis mortar. Such is the process often witnessed by Emile and Jules, who\r\nare always surprised, that stone, by having water poured on to it,\r\nshould become hot and turn the water into jets of steam. “Lime,” Uncle\r\nPaul explained to them, “is obtained from a widely diffused stone\r\ncalled limestone or, in more learned language, carbonate of lime. The\r\nprocess is of the simplest sort. It consists of heating the stone in\r\nkilns built in the open air in the vicinity of both limestone and fuel,\r\nso as to avoid the expense of transportation in the manufacture of a\r\nproduct that it is desirable to furnish at a low price.\r\n\r\n“A lime-kiln is about three meters high, and is lined with fire-proof\r\nbrick. An opening at the bottom serves for taking out the lime when the\r\nfiring has continued long enough. In filling the kiln it is the usual\r\npractice to begin by laying large pieces of limestone so as to form a\r\nsort of rude vault over the fireplace, and on this vault are piled\r\nsmaller fragments until the entire cavity is filled. The fuel used may\r\nbe fagots, brushwood, turf, or coal. After the firing has gone on long\r\nenough, operations are suspended and the lime is withdrawn by breaking\r\ndown the vault supporting the entire mass, which crumbles and comes\r\ncrowding out at the lower opening, whence it is usually removed.\r\n\r\n“Another method still followed in some localities and of more ancient\r\norigin consists of filling the kiln with alternate layers of fuel and\r\nlimestone. The whole rests on a bed of fagots that serves for starting\r\nthe fire. As soon as the fire has spread throughout the mass, the\r\nopening at the top is closed with pieces of sod in order to make the\r\ncombustion slower and more even.”\r\n\r\n“Nothing could be simpler,” said Jules, “than lime-making. Now I should\r\nlike to know what effect the heat of the kiln has on the limestone. How\r\ndoes it happen that stone turns into lime by passing through fire?”\r\n\r\n“Limestone,” answered his uncle, “contains two different substances:\r\nfirst, lime, and then an invisible substance, impalpable as air itself,\r\nin fact, a gas, carbonic acid gas. The name of carbonate of lime given\r\nto the limestone denotes precisely this combination. As it is when\r\ntaken from the ground, the stone contains the two substances closely\r\nunited, so incorporated indeed as no longer to have the qualities\r\ncharacterizing them when apart. Heat destroys this union: the lime\r\nstays in the kiln, and the carbonic acid gas is dissipated in the\r\natmosphere with the smoke from the burnt fuel. After this liberation of\r\nthe gas the lime is left in its pure state, no longer masked by the\r\npresence of another substance, but just as it is needed by the mason\r\nfor making mortar.”\r\n\r\n“Then all that the fire does,” queried Jules, “is just to break apart\r\nthe limestone and drive out the carbonic acid gas that it contained?”\r\n\r\n“What takes place in the lime-kiln,” replied his uncle, “is nothing but\r\nthe separation of the lime and the gas. Now let us turn our attention\r\nto the mortar. When lime is watered, it gets very hot, swells, cracks\r\nopen, and crumbles into a fine powder like flour. The heat that is\r\ngenerated comes from the violence with which the two substances rush\r\ntogether. Before absorbing water lime is called quicklime; after this\r\nabsorption, which has reduced it to powder, it is called slaked lime.\r\nThis slaked lime is reduced to a paste with water, and then well mixed\r\nand kneaded with sand. The result is the mortar used in laying stone\r\nand brick in order to hold the courses firmly together and give\r\nsolidity to the building.\r\n\r\n“There is one thing I advise you to note, if you have not already done\r\nso, since it will explain to you the part played by mortar in masonry.\r\nLook at the water that for several days has covered a bed of lime\r\nslaked by the masons. You will see floating on the surface small\r\ntransparent particles resembling ice. Well, these tiny fragments of\r\ncrust are nothing but stone like that from which the lime was obtained;\r\nin a word, they are limestone or carbonate of lime. To make stone of\r\nthat kind two substances are necessary, as I have just told you: lime\r\nand carbonic acid gas. The lime is furnished by the water, in which it\r\nmust be present in solution, since the water covers a thick bed of this\r\nmaterial; and as to the carbonic acid gas, it is furnished by the air,\r\nwhere it is always to be found, though in small quantities. Lime, then,\r\nhas this peculiarity, that it slowly incorporates the small amount of\r\ncarbonic acid gas present in the atmosphere, and so once more becomes\r\nthe limestone that it was before.\r\n\r\n“A similar process goes on in mortar: the lime takes back from the\r\natmosphere the gas that it had lost in the heat of the lime-kiln, and\r\nlittle by little becomes stone again. The sand mixed with it serves to\r\ndisintegrate the lime, which thus more easily absorbs the air necessary\r\nfor its conversion into limestone. When the mortar has fully resumed\r\nthe form of limestone the courses of masonry are so strongly bound one\r\nto another that the stones themselves sometimes break rather than give\r\nway.\r\n\r\n“What is known as fat lime is lime that develops great heat when\r\nbrought into contact with water, and also increases considerably in\r\nvolume, forming with the water a thick, cohesive paste. On the other\r\nhand, poor lime develops but little heat, disintegrates slowly, and\r\nincreases scarcely any in volume. The first kind comes from nearly pure\r\nlimestone and can be mixed with a large proportion of sand, thus making\r\na great quantity of mortar. The second kind is obtained from limestone\r\nhaving various foreign substances and will admit of but a small\r\nadmixture of sand, thus yielding less mortar than the other. Both have\r\nthe property of hardening in the air by the absorption of carbonic acid\r\ngas which converts them into limestone.\r\n\r\n“There is a third variety of lime called hydraulic lime, which has the\r\npeculiar merit of being able to harden under water. It is made from a\r\nlimestone containing a certain proportion of clay. Hydraulic mortar is\r\nused for the masonry of bridges, canals, cisterns, foundations, vaults,\r\nin fact for all stone and brick work under water or in damp soil.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nLIME IN AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\n“To be fertile a soil must contain limestone, sand, and clay, besides\r\nthe organic substances coming from humus and fertilizers. Now it may be\r\nthat nature has not endowed the soil with a sufficient quantity or with\r\nany of these three constituents. Then the character of the soil must be\r\ncorrected by giving it what it lacks. That is what is called improving\r\nthe land. Thus a soil that is too sandy is improved by the addition of\r\nlimestone and clay; one that is too compact, too clayey, is improved by\r\nadding sand and, still more, by adding limestone. Mineral substances\r\nthus added to the soil to correct it are called correctives. These\r\nsubstances coöperate also in the nutrition of plants, and from this\r\npoint of view may be regarded as mineral fertilizers.\r\n\r\n“One of the most valuable of correctives is lime, which is\r\nindispensable to soils lacking limestone, indispensable also to the\r\nnutrition of nearly all our cultivated vegetables. It acts in various\r\nways. First, it energetically attacks vegetable substances, decomposing\r\nthem and converting them into humus. A pile of leaves that would take\r\nlong months to rot becomes in a short time a mass of humus when mixed\r\nwith lime. Hence its great utility in fields overgrown with weeds, and\r\nin newly cleared land—in short, wherever there are old stumps, piles of\r\nleaves, remnants of wood, and patches of heather, which need to be\r\ndecomposed. With the help of lime all these herbaceous or woody\r\nsubstances are quickly converted into humus, with which the soil\r\nbecomes enriched to the great advantage of future crops.\r\n\r\n“In the second place, lime corrects or neutralizes the acidity peculiar\r\nto certain soils, as is proved by the following experiment. Let us mix\r\nsome vinegar, no matter how strong, with a little lime. In a short time\r\nthe smell and acid taste of the vinegar will have disappeared. Now\r\nwherever masses of vegetable refuse, such as leaves, mosses, rushes,\r\nold stumps, are undergoing decay, there are produced certain\r\nsour-tasting substances or, in other words, acids, which are invariably\r\nharmful to agriculture. This generation of acid occurs notably in turfy\r\nsoils, which have an excessive acidity favorable to the growth of\r\ncoarse rushes and sedges that are valueless to us, and at the same time\r\nthis acid is highly injurious to all our cultivated plants. Lime,\r\ntherefore, which is sure to correct this acidity, works wonders in\r\nmarshy lands, damp meadows, and turfy soils. We are warned of the need\r\nof lime by the appearance of ferns, heather, sedge or reed-grass,\r\nrushes, mosses and sphagnei.\r\n\r\n“Thirdly, when once mixed with the soil, lime speedily resumes the form\r\nit wore before passing through the lime-kiln; that is to say, it\r\nbecomes limestone, but in the shape of fine powder. This return to the\r\nlimestone condition is brought about by union with the carbonic acid\r\ngas coming from the atmosphere or thrown off by the substances decaying\r\nin the ground. Under this new form lime continues to play a useful part\r\nby supplying the calcareous ingredient to soil that lacked it, and also\r\nby preventing the clay from becoming too cohesive, too impervious to\r\nair and water.\r\n\r\n“The addition of lime to the soil should take place at the end of\r\nsummer, when the ground is dry. Little heaps of quicklime, each\r\ncontaining about twenty kilograms, are placed at intervals of five\r\nmeters and covered with a few spadefuls of earth. In a short time the\r\nmoisture in the atmosphere reduces the lime to a fine powder, which is\r\nthen spread evenly with a shovel and covered with earth—an operation\r\ninvolving no severe labor.\r\n\r\n“Lime should never be applied with seed. Mere contact with it would\r\nburn the young shoots. Neither should it be mixed with manure before it\r\nis used, since the immediate result would be a total loss of great\r\nquantities of ammonia, thrown off in gaseous form; and ammonia, as I\r\nhave explained, is one of the richest of fertilizers. Lime and manure,\r\ntherefore, should be used separately.\r\n\r\n“Soils rich in turf, clay, or granite are the ones on which lime acts\r\nmost beneficially. Because of the important results attained by the use\r\nof lime, its manufacture for purely agricultural purposes by certain\r\nexpeditious and effective methods is customary in many places. Thus in\r\nMayenne, where this application of lime has converted tracts of\r\nuncultivated clayey land into rich pastures or into wheat fields of\r\nexceptional fertility, lime is made in enormous kilns a dozen meters\r\nhigh and supported by the cliff that furnishes the limestone and\r\nsometimes the fuel also.\r\n\r\n“All animal matter makes excellent fertilizer. Of this class are old\r\nwoolen rags, stray bits of leather, fragments of horn, dried blood from\r\nslaughter-houses, and flesh not fit for human consumption. All these\r\nsubstances are rich in nitrogen and phosphates, and if mixed with farm\r\nmanure they add greatly to its value. Lime furnishes us the means of\r\nutilizing one of these substances, flesh, in the best way possible.\r\n\r\n“Dead bodies of animals, heedlessly left for dogs and crows and magpies\r\nto devour, should be cut up in pieces and then buried with a mixture of\r\nearth and quicklime. This attacks the flesh and quickly decomposes it,\r\nso that in a few months’ time there would be available a deposit of the\r\nmost powerful fertilizer instead of a useless, disease-breeding\r\ncarcass. As to the bones, resistant to the action of lime, they are\r\nburned to render them more friable, and then reduced to powder. This\r\nbone-dust, mixed with the fertilizer furnished by the decayed flesh,\r\nwill contribute to grain-field or pasture a rich supply of phosphorus.\r\nTo uses of this sort the farmer should put all horses and mules that\r\nhave had to be killed, as well as all large farm animals that have died\r\nof disease.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nPLASTER OF PARIS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Though less important than lime, plaster of Paris is nevertheless much\r\nused in building, especially for ceilings, molded chimney-pieces, and\r\nin the filling of cracks and cavities. It is a white powder which is\r\nmade into a paste by adding water, prepared a little at a time and only\r\nas fast as needed.”\r\n\r\n“I’ve seen them do it,” Emile interposed; “the workman takes a few\r\nhandfuls of that powder out of a bag, and then he mixes it with a\r\nlittle water in his trough with a trowel. He scrapes the paste all\r\ntogether in his hand and uses it immediately, before making any more.\r\nWhy don’t they mix all the plaster at once, as they do with lime when\r\nthey make mortar?”\r\n\r\n“Plaster is not all prepared beforehand for the reason that it hardens\r\nvery quickly, turns to stone, and is then unfit for use. Accordingly,\r\nto have it in a suitable state of softness, it must be prepared at the\r\nmoment of using.”\r\n\r\n“And what do they make that powder of that turns to stone when it is\r\nmixed with water?”\r\n\r\n“Plaster is made from a stone called gypsum, which, always the same as\r\nto its nature, varies much in appearance according to its state of\r\npurity. Sometimes it is a shapeless rock, whitish and more or less\r\ngrained; sometimes a fine fibrous mass with a silky luster; or, again,\r\na substance as transparent as glass and splitting into very thin scales\r\nwhich show, here and there, the superb colors of the rainbow. Struck by\r\ntheir beauty, workmen engaged in quarrying gypsum have given the name\r\nof ‘Jesus-stone’ to these brilliant laminæ. Also, from their brilliance\r\nand their cheapness, they are called ‘donkey’s mirrors.’ In ancient\r\ntimes these beautiful sheets of transparent gypsum were used as\r\nwindow-panes.\r\n\r\n“Impure gypsum, in the form of shapeless rock, is used for ordinary\r\nplaster, while pure gypsum, which comes in glass-like sheets or in\r\nblocks of a silky appearance, is used for fine plaster, as in all sorts\r\nof molding. The stone from which plaster is obtained occurs in\r\nabundance in several departments of France, where it forms hills and\r\neven whole mountains, as for example in the departments of the Seine,\r\nthe Mouths of the Rhone, and Vaucluse. For conversion into the usual\r\nplaster of Paris this stone must be subjected to a moderate heat. To\r\nthis end it is the practice to build with gypsum blocks a row of small\r\nvaults, and on these vaults to pile fragments of smaller size. Then the\r\nfiring is done by burning fagots and brushwood under these vaults.”\r\n\r\n“And is it carbonic acid gas this time, too, that is driven out by the\r\nheat, as in the manufacture of lime?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“No, my friend: gypsum does not contain any carbonic acid gas. It is\r\nmade of lime, as in limestone, but united with sulphuric acid, which\r\nheat is powerless to drive out. Besides this it contains water, which\r\nforms a fifth of the total weight of the stone. This water, and nothing\r\nfurther, escapes under the action of heat. With this expelled the\r\ngypsum is turned to plaster.\r\n\r\n“But this latter has a strong tendency to take on again the moisture\r\nparted with in the kiln, and thus to become once more what it was in\r\nthe beginning—primitive stone. It is this peculiarity that renders\r\ngypsum suitable for plaster. Moistened in the trough, the powdery\r\nmatter quickly incorporates the water that is thus restored to it, and\r\nthe whole hardens into a block having the solidity of gypsum that has\r\nnot yet passed through the kiln. Lime turns to stone by being permeated\r\nwith carbonic acid gas, which restores it to its limestone state.\r\nPlaster becomes stone by absorbing water, which brings it back to the\r\nstate of gypsum. The transformation of lime is slow, of plaster very\r\nrapid.\r\n\r\n“As soon as it comes from the kiln plaster is ground under vertical\r\nmillstones and then sifted. The powder must be kept in a very dry\r\nplace, since it contracts moisture easily and then will not harden or\r\nset, as they say, when mixed with water. You will perceive clearly\r\nenough that after being more or loss impregnated with moisture plaster\r\ncannot have the same tendency to absorb the water necessary to change\r\nit into a solid mass; the substance being already somewhat soaked will\r\nnot show the same thirst when the time comes for using it. All damp\r\nand, still more, all wet plaster is of no further use.\r\n\r\n“Statues, busts, medallions, and various other ornamental objects are\r\nmade by casting with fine plaster of Paris. This is prepared from the\r\npurest gypsum, those beautiful transparent scales I told you about a\r\nlittle while ago. It is heated in ovens similar to those used by\r\nbakers, and cut off from contact with the burning fuel, so as to\r\npreserve its whiteness. The powder, which looks like fine flour, is\r\nmixed with water and reduced to a smooth paste, which is then poured\r\ninto molds. When the plaster has set, the mold, which is in several\r\npieces, all joined together, is taken apart and the finished cast\r\nwithdrawn.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nPLASTER OF PARIS IN AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\n“In agriculture plaster of Paris has by no means the importance of\r\nlime; nevertheless it produces excellent results on clover, sainfoin,\r\nand lucerne. It is used in the spring for sprinkling the young leaves\r\nwhen they are still damp with the morning dew. Still, foggy weather is\r\nthe most favorable for this work. Plaster also acts well on rape, flax,\r\nbuckwheat, and tobacco, but has no effect on cereals.\r\n\r\n“The intelligent farmer puts plaster of Paris to still another use. In\r\nevery dunghill there is always going on a slow combustion, or\r\nfermentation, giving forth ammonia in vaporous form; and this ammonia\r\nescapes into the air as a total loss, whereas it ought to be retained\r\nas far as possible in the manure, since the compounds of ammonia\r\nconstitute the source whence plants obtain nitrogen. Therefore to\r\nprevent this waste, plaster is sprinkled over the dunghill. Sometimes,\r\ntoo, it is sprinkled over each layer of manure as the pile rises. The\r\nplaster absorbs the ammoniac vapors, gives them a little of its\r\nsulphuric acid, and converts them into a compound, sulphate of ammonia,\r\nwhich is proof against vaporization. Hence we say that plaster of Paris\r\nfixes ammonia, that is to say prevents its being dissipated.\r\n\r\n“To illustrate the fertilizing effect of plaster of Paris on lucerne,\r\nthe following incident is related. Franklin, one of the chief glories\r\nof the United States of North America, aware of the great fertilizing\r\npower of plaster, wished to extend the agricultural use of this\r\nsubstance among his fellow-citizens; but they, clinging to old customs,\r\nwould not listen to him. To convince them, Franklin spread plaster over\r\na field of lucerne by the side of the most frequented road leading out\r\nof Philadelphia, but spread it in such a way as to form letters and\r\nwords. The lucerne grew all over the field, but much taller, greener,\r\nand thicker where the plaster had been applied, so that the passers-by\r\nread in the field of lucerne these words traced in gigantic letters:\r\n‘Plaster of Paris was applied here.’ The ingenious expedient was a\r\ngreat success and plaster was very soon adopted in agriculture.”\r\n\r\n“The doubters must have been convinced,” said Jules, “on seeing those\r\nbig green letters rising above the rest of the lucerne. Did not\r\nFranklin do some other remarkable things? I remember the name; I have\r\nseen it several times in books.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied his uncle, “Franklin became by his learning, one of the\r\nmost remarkable men of his time. Among other things, we owe to him the\r\ninvention of the lightning-conductor, that tall pointed iron rod\r\nerected on the roofs of buildings to protect them from the thunderbolt.\r\nIt was he who first had the superb audacity to evoke the lightning from\r\nthe midst of the thunder-clouds, to direct it according to his wishes,\r\nand to bring it to his feet that he might study its nature. One stormy\r\nday in 1752 he went out into the country near Philadelphia in company\r\nwith his young son who carried a kite made out of a silk handkerchief\r\ntied at the four corners to glass rods. A pointed piece of metal\r\nterminated the apparatus. A long hemp cord, with a shorter cord of silk\r\ntied to the lower end, was fastened to the kite, which was then sent up\r\ntoward a black thundercloud. At first nothing happened to confirm the\r\nprevisions of the American sage, and he was beginning to despair of\r\nsuccess when there came a shower of rain and with it a flash of\r\nlightning. The wet cord proved a better conductor than when dry.\r\nWithout thinking of the danger he ran, and transported with joy at\r\nhaving brought within his reach that which causes thunder, Franklin put\r\nhis finger near the cord and made little spurts of fire dart out,\r\nlighted brandy from these sparks out of the sky, and only brought his\r\nperilous experiment to an end when he had fully determined the origin\r\nand nature of thunder and lightning. This was the way he studied the\r\nmystery at close quarters, discovered its nature, and finally succeeded\r\nin protecting buildings by means of a pointed iron rod.\r\n\r\n“Benjamin Franklin was born in Boston, North America, in 1706. He was\r\nthe youngest [2] of seventeen children. Hence, as his father was a poor\r\ntallow-chandler and soap-boiler, he could not acquire at home anything\r\nbeyond a knowledge of reading, writing, and arithmetic. At ten years of\r\nage he was taken from school and set to performing small tasks about\r\nthe house. He cut candle-wicks and poured the tallow into the molds,\r\nwaited on customers in his father’s shop, and ran errands. His work\r\nbrought him in a few pence which he did not yet know how to spend\r\njudiciously. He tells us the following little story on this subject,\r\nwhich we may all profit by.\r\n\r\n“‘One day,’ says he, ‘finding myself the possessor of a handful of\r\ncoppers, I ran out to buy some toys, when a little boy of about my own\r\nage happened to pass that way with a whistle in his hand. Delighted\r\nwith the sound of the whistle, I proposed to my comrade to exchange all\r\nmy money for his musical instrument. To this he very willingly agreed.\r\nElated with my purchase, which I thought very fine, I returned home,\r\nwhere I continued whistling to my great joy, but to the great\r\ndispleasure of the ears of my family. I told them of the magnificent\r\nexchange I had just made. My brothers and sisters made fun of me,\r\nsaying that for the price I had paid I might have bought dozens of such\r\nwhistles at the toy-shop. Only then did it occur to me what fine things\r\nI might have bought with my money, and I began to cry with vexation.\r\nChagrin at the exchange I had made now caused me more pain than the\r\nwhistle had before given me pleasure. This little incident made an\r\nimpression on me that has never been effaced and has been of service to\r\nme on more than one occasion. Ever since, whenever I am tempted to buy\r\nsome useless thing, I say to myself, “Do not pay too much for your\r\nwhistle”; and so I save my money.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nNATURAL FERTILIZERS—GUANO\r\n\r\n\r\n“Plant-life finds a part of its sustenance provided by nature in the\r\natmosphere; it finds carbonic acid gas, whence it derives the carbon it\r\nrequires; but the care and ingenuity of man have to supplement these\r\nnatural resources by providing fertilizers.\r\n\r\n“One of the chief of these fertilizers, farm manure, is furnished by\r\nthe bedding and excrement of animals. To obtain an excellent dressing\r\nof this sort it is customary to use for bedding, as far as possible,\r\nthe straw from grain, since this, being composed of hollow stalks, is\r\ncapable of holding considerable moisture. But, as in certain cases\r\nstraw would hardly be able to absorb all the fluid matter, it is well\r\nto make a trench in the stable and thus carry off the excess of liquid\r\nto a reservoir outside, where another heap of straw or similar material\r\nis in readiness to receive it. Then, at a distance from all rain-spouts\r\nand gutters, and in the shade of trees, a substantial layer of clay is\r\nspread on the ground, and on this is erected the pile of manure. All\r\naround it is dug a little trench which conducts the brown liquid that\r\noozes from the manure, and that is known as liquid manure, into a hole\r\nlarge enough to admit of the use of a bucket in drawing out the liquid.\r\n\r\n“Liquid manure is composed of the fluid matter with which the bedding\r\nis steeped, and it holds in solution a great part of the nutritive\r\nconstituents of the manure. Agriculture knows no richer fertilizer.\r\nHence care should be taken not to let it go to waste in neighboring\r\nditches or soak into the ground. That is why the pile is placed on a\r\nlayer of clay, which keeps the liquid manure from soaking into the\r\nground where it would be wasted; and it is also the reason for digging\r\na trench to receive this fluid matter and conduct it to the hole. When\r\nthis hole is full the liquid manure is drawn out with a bucket and\r\nthrown back on to the dung-hill.\r\n\r\n“Nor is that the whole of the story. A slow combustion will soon begin\r\nthroughout the pile of manure; its mass will ferment and become heated,\r\nand as a consequence the nitrogenous constituents will decompose and\r\nwill liberate ammonia, which will escape into the air and be lost if\r\nthe fermentation is excessive. It is to avoid too rapid a heating that\r\nthe manure-pile is placed in the shade and not under the direct rays of\r\nthe sun. Moreover, the liquid manure thrown on to the heap from time to\r\ntime also moderates the fermenting process.\r\n\r\n“Compare this careful method with the practice on most farms, where the\r\nmanure is heaped up without any precaution, without shelter from the\r\nsun, unprotected from the drenching rains, which wash away the soluble\r\nconstituents. Think of those rivulets of liquid manure trickling away\r\nin this direction and that, and collecting here and there in puddles of\r\ninfection. See how all the inmates of the poultry-yard scratch at the\r\nheap, turning over and scattering its contents, and thus causing the\r\nammonia to escape into the atmosphere. Can such a dung-hill be as\r\nvaluable as one that is attended to properly?\r\n\r\n“Liquid manure being the richest part of the whole pile, care should be\r\ntaken not to let escape what the bedding does not absorb. It should be\r\nfirst diluted with water and then applied to the growing crops. When it\r\nis desired for use in non-liquid form, it should be mixed with enough\r\nearth to absorb it, and the result is an excellent fertilizer.\r\n\r\n“In summer it is not unusual to enclose with hurdles a piece of land\r\nsoon to be cultivated, and into this enclosure a flock of sheep is\r\ndriven to pass the night under the care of the shepherd in his movable\r\nhut, and with the protection of trusty dogs well able to cope with any\r\nmarauding wolves. The next night the flock is quartered in another\r\nspot, and so on until the entire field has thus served, a little at a\r\ntime, as stable for the flock. The purpose of this procedure is to\r\nutilize the excrement, both solid and liquid, left behind by the flock.\r\nIn one night a sheep can fertilize a square meter of surface. This\r\nmethod of fertilizing is very effective because of the complete\r\nabsorption of the fluid matter by the soil.\r\n\r\n“Off the coast of Peru in South America are several small islands which\r\nform a common rendezvous for great numbers of sea-birds. Birds that\r\nfrequent the sea are all notorious for their insatiable appetite.\r\nConstantly in search of fish, which they live on, they spend the day\r\nexploring the surface of the waters at immense distance from land.\r\nNature has endowed them with prodigious flying power. To these\r\nindefatigable rovers an aërial promenade of some hundreds of leagues\r\nbefore dinner is a mere nothing. Scattered during the day in all\r\ndirections in quest of prey, they reach the islets in the evening to\r\nspend the night, arriving in flocks so dense as to darken the sky.\r\nBeing well fed, thanks to their foraging excursions, they cover the\r\nground at night with a thick layer of excrement. And as this has been\r\ngoing on century after century ever since the world was made, these\r\ndeposits, piled one on another, have at last become massive beds twenty\r\nor thirty meters thick, and so hard, so compact, that to break them it\r\nis necessary to use a pick or a petard, just as one would in quarrying\r\nstone. Workmen operate this dung mine, and vessels from all parts of\r\nthe world fetch cargoes of this valuable material, which is called\r\nguano. This enormous mass of dung, which has by the lapse of ages been\r\nturned into a sort of whitish loam, gives Peru an annual revenue\r\namounting to sixty millions of francs.\r\n\r\n“Guano is the strongest fertilizer known to agriculture. It is\r\nscattered broadcast over the field when vegetation is starting, and for\r\nthe best results a rather damp time is chosen for this work in order\r\nthat the moisture may convey to the roots of the plants, by gradual\r\ninfiltration, the soluble constituents of the fertilizer. The action of\r\nguano on vegetation is of the promptest, most powerful sort.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTHE STALK OF THE PLANT\r\n\r\n\r\n“The stalk is the common support of the plant’s various parts. It is\r\ncalled annual or herbaceous when it lives only one year, as in the\r\npotato, spinach, parsley, and all forms of vegetation that from their\r\nsoft structure belong to the class of herbs. Ligneous is the name given\r\nto the stalk when, designed to live for a greater or less number of\r\nyears, it is made of strong woody fibers, such as we find in the trunks\r\nof trees.\r\n\r\n“Let us make a clean cut through any tree-trunk, that of an oak for\r\nexample. We shall find it divided into three parts: in the center the\r\npith or marrow, very slightly developed; around the marrow the wood\r\nproper; and, finally, on the outside, the bark. A closer examination\r\nshows that the wood is formed of concentric layers which are indicated\r\nin the cross-section by a series of circles having the marrow for a\r\ncommon center. These layers are called ligneous zones or, since one is\r\nformed every year, annual layers. During the summer there is a downward\r\nflow, throughout the tree, of a peculiar liquid, the descending sap,\r\nwhich constitutes the fluid nourishment of the tree. This liquid runs\r\nbetween the wood and the bark and becomes, little by little in its\r\ncourse, on one side a layer of wood which attaches itself to the outer\r\nsurface of the preceding year’s layer, and on the other side a thin\r\nsheet of bark which is added to the inner surface of the bark already\r\nformed.\r\n\r\n“Thus each year both bark and wood form a new layer; but this added\r\nlayer is applied in opposite ways in the two instances,—outside on the\r\nwood, inside on the bark. The wood thus encircled from year to year by\r\nnew layers increases in age toward the center and becomes younger and\r\nyounger toward the circumference, whereas the bark, lined every year\r\nwith a fresh sheet, shows its youth on the inside and its age on the\r\noutside. The first buries inside the trunk its decrepit and dead\r\nlayers; the second thrusts its old layers outside, where they crack and\r\nfall off in large scales. This aging process is simultaneous on the\r\noutside and in the center of the tree-trunk; but between the wood and\r\nthe bark life is always at work, creating fresh accretions.\r\n\r\n“Here are some experimental proofs of this annual formation of a\r\nligneous layer. A strip of bark is removed from the trunk of a tree,\r\nand on the wood thus laid bare is fastened a thin sheet of metal. The\r\nbark is then replaced and bound with ligatures so that the wound may\r\nheal. We will suppose ten years have passed. The bark is raised again\r\nat the same place. The metal sheet is no longer visible; to find it you\r\nmust bore deep into the wood. Now, if you count the ligneous layers\r\nremoved before reaching the metal sheet, you will find precisely ten,\r\njust the number of years that have passed.\r\n\r\n“A number of observations like the following are familiar: Some\r\nforesters cut down a beech bearing on its trunk the date 1750. The same\r\ninscription was found again in the inner substance of the wood, but to\r\nreach it they had to cut through fifty-five layers on which no mark\r\nwhatever appeared. If now, we add 55 to 1750 we obtain precisely the\r\nyear when the tree was felled, or 1805. The inscription carved on the\r\ntrunk in the year 1750 had passed through the bark and reached the\r\nlayer of wood that was then outermost. Since that event fifty-five\r\nyears had passed and new layers, exactly the same in number, had grown\r\nover the first.\r\n\r\n“Thus a tree is composed of a succession of woody sheaths, the outer\r\nones enveloping the inner. The stem or trunk contains them all; the\r\nbranches, according to their age, contain more or fewer. Each one\r\nrepresents a single year’s growth. The woody sheath of the present year\r\noccupies the exterior of the trunk, immediately under the bark; those\r\nof former years occupy the interior, and the nearer they are to the\r\ncenter the older they are. The layers of future years will come one at\r\na time and take their places over preceding layers, so that what is now\r\nthe outermost layer will in its turn be found embedded in the body of\r\nthe trunk.\r\n\r\n“Of all these ligneous zones of unequal age the most important to-day\r\nis the outside one; its destruction would cause the death of the tree,\r\nsince through it the nutritive juices of the earth reach the buds,\r\nleaves, and young branches. In their time the interior layers, one by\r\none, when they formed the surface, rendered the same service to the\r\nbuds of their day; but now that these buds have become branches the\r\ninner layers have only a secondary office, or even none at all. Those\r\nnearest the outside still have some aptness for work and help the layer\r\nof the year to carry the juices from the earth to the branches. As to\r\nthe innermost ones, they have lost all activity; their wood is hard,\r\ndried up, encrusted with inert matter. In their decrepitude these\r\ninterior layers are incapable of service in the work of vegetation; the\r\nmost they can do is by the support of their firm woody structure to\r\ngive solidity to the whole. Thus the tree’s activity decreases from the\r\noutside toward the center. On the surface are youth, vigor, labor; in\r\nthe center old age, ruin, repose.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE ROOT\r\n\r\n\r\n“The stalk or trunk is the upward-growing part of the plant, and needs\r\nair and light. The root, on the contrary, is the downward-growing part,\r\nand it needs soil and darkness. The extreme ends of the root’s various\r\nsubdivisions are always growing, always young, of delicate structure,\r\nand for that reason admirably fitted for imbibing, very much as a fine\r\nsponge would do, the liquids with which the soil is impregnated.\r\nBecause of their facility in absorbing moisture these ever-growing\r\ntip-ends are called spongioles. The spongioles terminate the rootlets,\r\nthat is to say the final subdivisions of the root, subdivisions known\r\nas root-hairs on account of their resemblance to real hair.\r\n\r\n“The root takes various forms, which are all reducible to two\r\nfundamental types. Sometimes it consists of a main body or tap-root,\r\nwhich sends out branches as it bores deeper into the soil. This\r\ndesignation, tap-root, is a common and familiar term. Sometimes the\r\nroot assumes the form of a tuft, a bunch of rootlets, simple or\r\nbranching, which, springing from the same point, continue to grow at a\r\nnearly equal rate and on an equal footing as to importance. Roots of\r\nthis sort are commonly known as fibrous roots.\r\n\r\n“As a general rule, the growth of the root keeps pace with that of the\r\nstem or trunk. Thus the oak, elm, maple, beech, and all our large trees\r\nhave a vigorous, deep-growing root as anchorage for the enormous\r\nsuperstructure, to brace it firmly against the wind. But there is no\r\nlack of lowly herbage that has roots quite out of proportion to the\r\nother parts,—veritable tap-roots of greater size and vigor than many a\r\nplant of far greater aërial development can boast. To this class belong\r\nthe mallow, carrot, and radish. Lucerne has for support to its meager\r\nfoliage a root that bores two or three meters into the ground.\r\n\r\n“An agricultural practice of supreme interest is based, at least\r\npartly, on the excessive development of certain roots. The plant is a\r\nlaboratory where life converts into nutritive matter the manure from\r\nour stables and poultry-yards. A cart-load of dung becomes at the\r\nfarmer’s pleasure, after passing through one sort of plant or another,\r\na crop of peas or beans, a basket of fruit, or a loaf of bread. Hence\r\nthis fertilizer is a very precious thing which nothing can replace and\r\nwhich must be utilized to the very utmost. The nourishment of us all\r\ndepends on it. Enriched with this fertilizer, the soil produces, we\r\nwill say, a first harvest of wheat. But wheat with its bunch of short\r\nand fine roots, has drawn only upon the upper layer of fertilizing\r\nmaterial, leaving intact all that the rain has dissolved and carried\r\ndown into the lower layers. It has performed its mission admirably, it\r\nis true; it has made a clean sweep and converted into wheat all the\r\nfertilizer contained in the layer of soil accessible to its roots, so\r\nthat if wheat were sown a second time no harvest would be obtained. The\r\nsoil, then, is exhausted on the surface, but in its underlying strata\r\nit is still rich. Well, what crop shall we choose for the utilization\r\nof these lower strata and the production of still further supplies of\r\nfood? It cannot be barley, oats, or rye, since their little fibrous\r\nroots would find nothing to glean in the surface soil after the first\r\ncrop of wheat. But it will be lucerne, since this plant will send down\r\nits roots, each as thick as your finger, to the depth of one, two, or\r\neven three meters, if need be, and give back the fertilizer in the form\r\nof forage, which, with the help of the animal that feeds on it, will be\r\nconverted into nutritious meat, valuable dairy products, excellent\r\nwool, or, at the very least, animal power for draft service or other\r\nwork. This succession of two or more different kinds of crops for the\r\nutmost utilization of a given area of prepared soil is called rotation\r\nof crops, of which there will be more to say later.\r\n\r\n“Deep roots, so admirably adapted to the utilization of the lower\r\nstrata of the soil, become in other circumstances a source of serious\r\ndifficulty. Suppose a tree is to be transplanted. Its long tap-root\r\nwill make the operation difficult and hazardous. You must dig deep,\r\nboth in pulling it out and in replanting it; and then you must be\r\ncareful not to injure the root, for it is all in one piece and if it\r\ndoes not take hold and grow the sapling will die. In this case it would\r\nbe much to the tree’s advantage to have fibrous roots running down only\r\nto a slight depth; it could then be pulled up easily, and if some roots\r\nperished in the operation enough would be left intact to insure the\r\nsuccess of the transplanting.\r\n\r\n“This result can be obtained: it is no difficult matter to make the\r\ntree lose its tap-root and acquire, not a regular bundle of roots of\r\neven length; but a short and much ramified root that possesses the\r\nadvantages of the bunch of small roots without having its shape. Thus\r\nin nurseries where young trees remain for some years before being\r\ntransplanted, after two years’ growth a spade is passed under the\r\nsurface of the soil to cut off the main root, which would in time\r\nbecome a deep tap-root. The stump that remains then branches out\r\nhorizontally without going deeper. Another way is to pave the nursery\r\nbed with tiles. The tap-root of the young tree pushes downward until it\r\nreaches this barrier, where it is straightway forced to stop growing in\r\ndepth and compelled to send out lateral branches.\r\n\r\n“The kind of root we have thus far been talking about is primordial,\r\noriginal; every plant has it on emerging from the seed; it appears as\r\nsoon as the seed germinates. But many plants have other roots that\r\ndevelop at different points of the stem, replacing the original root\r\nwhen that dies, or at least coming to its aid if it continues to live.\r\nThey are called adventitious roots, and they play a highly important\r\npart, notably in certain horticultural operations such as propagating\r\nby slips and layers, which we will talk about later.\r\n\r\n“Besides these two operations, the object of which is to multiply the\r\nplant, it is customary to prompt the growth of adventitious roots\r\neither for the purpose of fixing the plant more firmly in the ground or\r\nin order to increase its yield. The best way to attain this result is\r\nto bank up the earth at the base of the stalk. This process is\r\nsometimes called earthing up. The buried portion soon sends out a great\r\nnumber of roots. Indian corn, for example, if left to itself is too\r\npoorly rooted to resist wind and rain, which beat it down. In order to\r\ngive it greater stability the farmer earths up the corn. In the earth\r\nbanked up at the base of the stalk bundles of adventitious roots form\r\nand furnish the plant a firmer support.\r\n\r\n“Wheat stalks bear on their lower ends buds which, according to\r\ncircumstances, perish to the detriment of the harvest or develop into\r\nroots and promote the growth of more ears of grain. Let us suppose\r\nwheat has been sown in the autumn. In that cold and rainy season\r\nvegetation is slow, the stalk grows but little, and the various buds\r\nremain very close together almost on a level with the ground. But if\r\nthey are favored by having damp soil near them, these buds send forth\r\nadventitious roots which nourish them directly and promote a fullness\r\nof growth that the ordinary root by itself could not have secured. Thus\r\nstimulated by nourishment, these buds develop into so many\r\nwheat-stalks, each one ending at a later period in an ear of grain. But\r\nif wheat is sown in the spring, its rapid growth under the influence of\r\nmild weather brings the buds too high for them to send out roots. The\r\nstalk then remains single. In the first case from one grain of wheat\r\nsown there springs a cluster of stalks producing as many ears; in the\r\nsecond case the harvest is reduced to its lowest terms: from one grain\r\nof wheat one stalk, one ear. Hence this development of the lower buds\r\nof cereals is of the greatest importance. To obtain it, or, in\r\nagricultural terms, to make the wheat send up suckers, the lower buds\r\nmust send down adventitious roots, as they will do if they are brought\r\ninto contact with the soil. To this end, shortly after germination a\r\nwooden roller is passed over the field, and this roller, without\r\nbruising the young stalks, pushes them deeper into the ground.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nBUDS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Let us take a branch of lilac or any shrub. In the angle formed by\r\neach leaf and the branch that bears it, an angle called the axil of the\r\nleaf, we shall see a little round body enveloped in brown scales. That\r\nis a bud or, as it is also named, an eye.\r\n\r\n“Buds make their appearance at fixed points, and it is the rule for one\r\nto form in the axil of each leaf; it is also the rule for the tip-end\r\nof the branch to bear one. Those situated in the axils of the leaves\r\nare called axillary buds, and those that are found on the ends of\r\nbranches, terminal buds. They are not all equally vigorous, the\r\nstrongest being at the top of the branch, the weakest at the bottom.\r\nThe lower leaves even shelter such small ones in their axils that only\r\nthe closest scrutiny will reveal them. These diminutive buds often\r\nperish without developing unless artificially encouraged to do so. On a\r\nlilac branch it is easy to note these differences of size from bud to\r\nbud.\r\n\r\n“Both terminal and axillary buds are divided into two classes. In\r\ndeveloping some sprout up and produce only leaves; these are called\r\nleaf buds. When fully developed they become shoots or scions, and\r\nfinally branches. Others push upward but little and bear only flowers\r\nor leaves and flowers simultaneously. They are called flower buds, or\r\nsimply buds. It is very easy to distinguish one kind from the other on\r\nour fruit-trees, the leaf buds being long and pointed, the flower buds\r\nround and thicker.\r\n\r\n“All summer long the leaf buds grow in the axils of the leaves; they\r\nare gaining strength to go through the winter. Cold weather comes and\r\nthe leaves fall, but the buds remain in their place, firmly implanted\r\non a ledge of the bark, or a sort of little cushion, situated just\r\nabove the scar left by the falling of the adjacent leaf. To withstand\r\nthe rigors of cold and dampness, which would be fatal to them, winter\r\nclothing is indispensable. It consists of a warm inner envelope of\r\nflock and down, and a strong outer casing of well varnished scales. Let\r\nus examine for instance the bud of a chestnut-tree. Within we shall\r\nfind a sort of wadding enswathing its delicate little leaves, while on\r\nthe outside a solid cuirass of scales, arranged with the regularity of\r\ntiles on a roof, wraps it closely. Furthermore, to keep out all\r\ndampness, the separate pieces of this scale armor are coated with a\r\nresinous cement which now resembles dried varnish, but softens in the\r\nspring to let the bud open. Then the scales, no longer stuck together,\r\nseparate, all sticky, and the first leaves unfold covered with a\r\nvelvety red down. Nearly all buds, at the time of their spring travail,\r\npresent in different degrees this stickiness resulting from the\r\nsoftening of their resinous coating. I will mention especially the buds\r\nof the ash, alder, and, above all, the poplar, which when pressed\r\nbetween the fingers emit an abundant yellow glue, of bitter taste. This\r\nsubstance is diligently gathered by the bees, which use it to make\r\ntheir bee-glue, that is to say the cement with which they stop the\r\nfissures and rough-coat the walls of their hive before constructing the\r\ncombs. Under its modest appearance the bud is a veritable masterpiece:\r\nits varnish excludes dampness; its scales protect it from harmful\r\natmospheric influences; its lining of flock, wadding, downy red hair,\r\nkeeps out the cold.\r\n\r\n“The scales form the most important part of the bud’s winter clothing.\r\nThey are nothing more nor less than tiny leaves hardened and toughened,\r\nin short so modified as to serve the purpose of protection. The leaves\r\nimmediately under them and constituting the heart of the bud have the\r\nusual form. They are all small, pale, delicate, and arranged in a\r\nmarvelously methodical manner so as to take up the least possible room\r\nand at the same time to be contained, all of them, despite their\r\nconsiderable number, within the narrow limits of their cradle. It is\r\nsurprising what a quantity of material a bud can make room for under\r\nits sheath of scales in a space so small that we should find it\r\ndifficult to pack away there a single hemp-seed; and yet it holds\r\nleaves by the dozen or a whole bunch of flowers. The bunch enclosed in\r\na lilac bud numbers a hundred and more blossoms. And all this is\r\ncontained in that narrow cell, with no tearing or bruising of any\r\nportion of it. If the various parts of a bud were disconnected, one by\r\none, if the delicate arrangement were once undone, what fingers would\r\nbe clever enough to put it together again? The principal leaves lend\r\nthemselves to a thousand different modes of arrangement in order to\r\noccupy the least space possible. They take in the bud the form of a\r\ncornet; or they roll themselves up in a scroll, sometimes from one edge\r\nonly, sometimes from both; or they fold up lengthwise or crosswise; or\r\nthey may roll up into little balls, or crumple up, or fold like a fan.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nADVENTITIOUS BUDS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Buds such as we have been considering appear in the spring and then\r\nspend the summer in gaining strength, after which they remain\r\nstationary and as if wrapped in deep sleep all through the winter. The\r\nfollowing spring they wake up and grow into branches or blossom into\r\nflowers. It is plainly to be seen that these dormant buds, as\r\narboriculture calls them in its picturesque language, must, in order to\r\nwithstand the summer heat and the winter’s cold, be clothed so as not\r\nto be parched by the sun or killed by the frost. They are all in fact\r\ncovered with a wrapping of scales, and for that reason are called scaly\r\nbuds. Buds of this class are found in the lilac, chestnut, pear, apple,\r\ncherry, poplar, and in fact nearly all the trees of our country.\r\n\r\nBut if a tree can wait and devote a whole year to the development of\r\nits buds, which are clothed in a sheath of scales because of this\r\nwaiting, there are a multitude of plants that have only a limited time\r\nat their disposal: they live only a year, and hence are called annuals.\r\nSuch are the potato, carrot, pumpkin, and a great many more. In a few\r\nmonths or days they must hastily develop their buds. These, not having\r\nto pass through the winter, are never enveloped in protecting scales:\r\nthey are naked buds. As soon as they appear they elongate, unfold their\r\nleaves, and become branches taking part in the work of the whole. Very\r\nsoon, in the axils of their leaves, other buds make their appearance\r\nand behave like their predecessors; that is to say, they develop\r\nquickly into branches which in their turn produce other buds. And so on\r\nindefinitely until winter puts a stop to this scaffold of branches and\r\nkills the whole plant. Thus annuals ramify rapidly. In one year they\r\nproduce several generations of branches implanted one on another,\r\nsometimes more, sometimes fewer, according to their species and their\r\ndegree of vigor. Their buds, designed for immediate development, are\r\nalways naked. On the contrary, those forms of vegetation that have a\r\nlong life, such as trees, ramify slowly; they have only one generation\r\nof branches a year, and their buds, destined to live through the\r\nwinter, are scaly.\r\n\r\nCertain examples of plant-life have both kinds of buds. Such, for\r\ninstance, are the peach-tree and the grape-vine. At the end of winter\r\nthe vine-shoot bears scaly buds lined with flock, and the peach\r\nbranches scaly buds coated with varnish. Both belong to the class of\r\ndormant buds: they have slept all winter in their sheaths of fur and\r\nscales. In the spring they develop into branches according to the\r\ngeneral rule; but at the same time there appear in the axils of the\r\nleaves other buds without any protecting covering, and these develop\r\nimmediately into branches. Thus the grape-vine and the peach-tree beget\r\ntwo generations in one year: the first, the issue of the scaly buds\r\nthat have endured the winter; the second, naked buds formed in the\r\nspring and developing very soon after their formation. The branches\r\narising from these latter finally give birth to scaly buds, which sleep\r\nthrough the winter and reproduce the same order of things the following\r\nyear.\r\n\r\n“Both axillary and terminal buds are in the normal order of plant-life:\r\nthey appear in all forms of vegetation that live several years. But\r\nwhen the plant is in danger, when by some accident the regular buds are\r\nlacking or insufficient, others spring into being here and there at\r\nhaphazard, even on the root if necessary, to restore a languishing\r\nvitality and put the plant once more in a flourishing condition. These\r\naccidental buds are to the part of the plant above the ground what\r\nadventitious roots are to the part below the ground: the menace of the\r\nmoment calls them into existence at any endangered point. The edges of\r\nthe wound caused by the lopping off of a branch, the part of a\r\ntree-trunk constricted by a band, portions of the bark injured by\r\ncontusion, these are the points where they appear by preference. They\r\nare called adventitious buds, but their structure does not differ from\r\nthat of normal buds.\r\n\r\n“Adventitious buds lend themselves to valuable uses. Suppose a number\r\nof young saplings to be planted at proper intervals in the ground. If\r\nthey are then left to themselves these saplings grow each into a single\r\ntrunk and form collectively a wood or forest. But it may be of\r\nadvantage to replace each of these single trunks by a group of several\r\ntrunks. In that case the young plantation is cut down to the level of\r\nthe ground, and around the edge of each cross-section there presently\r\nspring a number of adventitious buds which shoot up into an equal\r\nnumber of stems, so that each sapling that would have developed only\r\none trunk is transformed into a stump from which start numerous sprouts\r\nor suckers, all of the same age and strength. Then instead of a wood or\r\nforest we have a growth of underbrush, or a copse. When the suckers\r\nhave acquired the desired size, a fresh cutting back lays them low and\r\ninduces a still denser growth of shoots by multiplying the number of\r\nwounds. It is thus that from a single stock, repeatedly cut back and as\r\noften reinvigorated by the growth of adventitious buds, a quantity of\r\nwood is obtained exceeding that produced by the free and solitary\r\ndevelopment of one tree.\r\n\r\n“Spared by the axe, the poplar rises in a majestic obelisk of verdure.\r\nThe willow, so ungraceful in appearance along the banks of our ditches,\r\nwith its shapeless top bristling with shoots sticking out in all\r\ndirections, is, in its natural state, a tree of rare elegance on\r\naccount of the suppleness of its branches and the fineness of its\r\nfoliage. Considered as a thing of beauty, it certainly has nothing to\r\ngain by man’s interference with its mode of growth. But, alas,\r\nproductivity does not always go hand in hand with beauty; and if it is\r\ndesired to make these two trees, the poplar and the willow, produce a\r\ngreat mass of branches and fire-wood, decapitation, repeated\r\nperiodically, transforms them into pollards, seamed with scars, gaping\r\nwith bleeding wounds, disfigured with bruises, but at the same time\r\ncontending against all this hard usage by a never-failing growth of\r\nadventitious buds which constantly replace with increasing prodigality\r\nthe brushwood that has fallen victim to the axe.\r\n\r\n“To finish the subject of adventitious buds—buds that persist in\r\nmultiplying even when the parent stock languishes, and that withstand\r\ndestruction until utter exhaustion has set in—let us recall for a\r\nmoment certain weeds such as dog’s-tooth grass, cock-spur grass, and\r\nother grasses that are so hard to keep out of our garden paths unless\r\nwe do something more than merely rake the surface of the ground. You\r\nmay have taken infinite pains, we will say, to clean the paths, and\r\nhave left them immaculate, or at least you think so. But you are\r\nmistaken. In a few days the grass has all come back in richer tufts\r\nthan ever. The reason is plain enough now: your raking simply cut back\r\nthe stems, leaving wounds that immediately covered themselves with\r\nadventitious buds, which quickly sent up new stalks. Thus, instead of\r\ndestroying, you have multiplied. The only way to clear the ground of\r\nweeds is to pull them up by the roots; that done, you may consider the\r\njob well done.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nBULBS AND BULBLETS\r\n\r\n\r\n“After attaining the requisite degree of strength the buds of certain\r\nplants leave the parent stalk and, if we may so express it, emigrate;\r\nthat is to say, they detach themselves and take root in the earth, to\r\ndraw nourishment directly therefrom. Now it is evident that a bud\r\ndesigned for independent development cannot have precisely the\r\nstructure of one destined never to leave the parent stem. To satisfy\r\nits first needs before roots capable of nourishing it have been sent\r\ndown into the soil, it must of necessity have a certain prepared store\r\nof nutriment. Therefore every bud that emigrates carries a supply of\r\nfood with it.\r\n\r\n“There is cultivated in gardens a pretty little lily native to high\r\nmountains, bearing orange-colored blossoms, and known as the\r\nbulbiferous lily. Here is a piece of the stalk with its buds situated\r\nin the axils of the leaves. These buds must pass through the winter and\r\ndevelop the following spring. They are covered with succulent scales,\r\nvery thick, tender, and fleshy, good for nourishment as well as for\r\nprotection. This store of provisions makes the bud quite plump. Toward\r\nthe end of summer some of these buds leave the mother plant; they fall\r\nat the slightest wind, scatter on the ground, and are henceforth given\r\nover to their own resources. If the season is a wet one, many of them,\r\nstill in place at the axils of the leaves, send out one or two little\r\nroots that hang in the air as if trying to reach the ground. Before\r\nOctober arrives all the buds have fallen. Then the mother stalk dies.\r\nSoon the autumn winds and rains cover the scattered buds with dead\r\nleaves and mold. Under this shelter they swell all winter from the\r\njuices of their scales, plunge their roots into the ground little by\r\nlittle, and, behold, in the spring each one displays its first green\r\nleaf, continues henceforth its independent growth, and finally becomes\r\na plant like the original lily.\r\n\r\n“The fleshy, scaly buds destined to develop independently of the mother\r\nstalk are called bulblets. No plant known to agriculture could furnish\r\nus so striking an example of bud-emigration as the bulbiferous lily;\r\nbut in our kitchen gardens we have garlic, which acts in almost the\r\nsame way. Take a whole head of garlic. On the outside are dry, white\r\nwrappings. Strip these off and underneath you will find large buds\r\nwhich can easily be detached one by one. Then come more white wrappings\r\nfollowed by new buds, so that the entire head is a package of alternate\r\nwrappings and buds.\r\n\r\n“These wrappings are the dried-up lower portions of the old leaves of\r\nthe plant, leaves blanched where the soil covered them, and where they\r\nstill remain, and formerly green where exposed to the air, though that\r\npart is now lacking. In the axils of these leaves buds have formed\r\naccording to the general rule; only, as they are destined to develop by\r\nthemselves, they have stored up supplies in their thickened scales, and\r\nthat is what makes them unusually large. Split one of them lengthwise.\r\nUnder a tough sheath you will find an enormous fleshy mass forming\r\nalmost the whole of the bud. That is the storehouse. With such supplies\r\nof food the bud is well able to take care of itself. And, in fact, when\r\na market-gardener wishes to raise a crop of garlic, he does not have\r\nrecourse to the seed; that would take too long. He turns his attention\r\nto the buds; that is to say, he plants in the ground, one by one, the\r\nbulblets of which the heads of garlic are composed. Each of these\r\nbulblets, sustained at first by its own reserves of food, puts forth\r\nroots and leaves and becomes a complete garlic plant.\r\n\r\n“From the bulblet to the bulb, from garlic to an onion, there is but a\r\nsingle step. Let us split an onion in two from top to bottom. We shall\r\nfind it composed of a succession of fleshy scales compactly fitted\r\ntogether. In the heart of this cluster of succulent scales, which are\r\nnothing but leaves so modified as to form a food-storehouse, are found\r\nother leaves of normal shape and green color. An onion, then, is a bud\r\nprovisioned for an independent life by the conversion of its outside\r\nleaves into fleshy scales; and it is called a bulb, not a bulblet,\r\nbecause of its size, the latter term being the diminutive form of\r\n‘bulb.’ Bulb and bulblet differ merely in size: the bulb is larger, the\r\nbulblet smaller, and that is all.\r\n\r\n“Every one has noticed that an onion hanging on the wall ready at hand\r\nfor the cook, is awakened to life in the course of the winter by the\r\nheat of the room, and from within its envelope of red scales puts forth\r\na beautiful green shoot that seems to protest against the rigors of the\r\nseason and reminds us of the sweet pleasures of spring. As it develops,\r\nits fleshy scales wrinkle, soften, become flabby, and finally fall off\r\nin decay to serve as fertilizer for the young plant. Sooner or later,\r\nhowever, its store of provision being exhausted, the shoot perishes\r\nunless placed in earth. There we have a striking example of a bud that\r\ndevelops independently by means of its own accumulated supplies. The\r\nleek is also a bulb, but very slender in shape. Like the onion, it\r\nconsists of a cluster of lower leaf-parts sheathed one inside another.\r\nAmong ornamental plants having bulbs are the lily, the tulip, and the\r\nhyacinth.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTUBERS—STARCH\r\n\r\n\r\n“There are buds that, though called to an independent existence, do\r\nnot, before separating from the mother plant, store up provisions nor\r\nthicken their scales; but the plant itself is charged with feeding\r\nthem. When it is intended that the stem or branch shall itself maintain\r\nthe buds it bears, then, instead of coming out into the open air where\r\nit would speedily cover itself with foliage and flowers, it remains\r\nunderground and has for leaves only rudimentary scales. It grows so\r\ncorpulent and deformed as to cease to bear the name of branch and to\r\ntake instead that of tuber. As soon as necessary supplies have been\r\nstored up, the tuber detaches itself from the mother plant, and\r\nthenceforth the buds it bears find in it abundant nourishment for their\r\nseparate existence. A tuber, then, is an underground branch swollen\r\nwith nutritive material and having undeveloped scales in place of\r\nleaves, and it is also dotted here and there with buds which it must\r\nfeed.\r\n\r\n“Let us now look at a potato. What do we see on the surface? Certain\r\nsmall cavities or eyes; that is to say, so many buds, for these eyes\r\ndevelop into branches if the potato is placed in favorable conditions.\r\nOn old potatoes, late in the season, the buds are seen to send forth\r\nsprouts which need only a little sunshine to turn green and become\r\nstalks. Agriculture makes good use of this peculiarity: to propagate\r\nthe plant it is customary to put into the ground, not the seeds, which\r\nwould yield no harvest before the lapse of several years, but the\r\ntubers, which produce abundantly the same year. Or else the potato is\r\ncut into pieces and each piece, planted in the ground, sends up a new\r\nplant on condition that it has at least one eye; if it has none it rots\r\nwithout producing anything.\r\n\r\n“Furthermore, you can see on the eyes tiny little scales, which are\r\nleaves modified to adapt them to an underground life, leaves with the\r\nsame right to the name as the tough scales of an ordinary bud. Since it\r\nhas leaves and buds the potato is therefore a branch. Should there\r\nremain any lingering doubts on this subject, it might be added that by\r\nearthing up the plant, that is to say by heaping soil around the stalk,\r\nthe young branches thus buried can be converted into potato-bearers;\r\nand it might also be added that in rainy and cloudy seasons it is not\r\nrare to see some of the ordinary branches thicken and swell up in the\r\nopen air, and thus produce potatoes more or less perfect. Accordingly\r\nthe potato is to be regarded as an underground branch swollen with\r\nnourishment—in short, a tuber.\r\n\r\n“Many other plants produce similar branches that grow under ground. In\r\nthis number is the Jerusalem artichoke, the tubers of which have buds\r\narranged two by two on opposite swellings, from front to back and from\r\nright to left in turn, exactly as are leaves and buds on the stem.\r\n\r\n“The potato feeds it buds on a farinaceous substance called fecula or,\r\nin less learned language, starch. It is the very material that makes\r\nthe vegetable so rich in nutriment for us. We turn to our own account\r\nwhat the plant has stored up for its young shoots. Starch is contained\r\nin the extremely small cavities with which the flesh of the tuber is\r\nall riddled. These cavities are called cells. They are microscopic sacs\r\nmade of a fine membrane and having no opening. Crammed full of starch\r\ngrains and crowded one against another, they compose the fleshy\r\nsubstance of the potato. But these cavities are so small that a person\r\nwould strain his eyes in vain in any attempt to see them in the\r\ncross-section of a potato. A magnifying glass is necessary. So minute\r\nare the cells that in a piece of potato no larger than a pin’s head\r\nthere is room for dozens and dozens of them. This picture shows you,\r\nbut much larger than in nature, a potato cell with the grains of starch\r\nit encloses.”\r\n\r\n“How beautifully,” exclaimed Emile, “those grains of starch are\r\narranged in their little cubby-hole! They might be taken for a nest of\r\neggs. And you say there are heaps and heaps of these little starch\r\ncells?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my boy; in a medium-sized potato they could be counted by\r\nmillions and millions.”\r\n\r\n“It must be rather a curious sight to look at a little piece of potato\r\nthrough a powerful magnifying-glass.”\r\n\r\n“It is indeed one of the most curious sights, this countless multitude\r\nof starch grains, all the same shape, all white as snow, gathered\r\ntogether by tens, dozens, scores, and even more, in their delicate\r\nlittle box-like cells.\r\n\r\n“Let us perform an experiment not beyond our means; let us remove the\r\nstarch from a potato. All we need to do is to tear open the cells in\r\norder to liberate the starch grains, and then filter them out. Watch me\r\ndo it. With a kitchen grater I reduce the potato to pulp and thus tear\r\nthe cells open. Now I put the pulp on a piece of linen over a large\r\nglass and pour a little water through it with one hand while with the\r\nother I keep stirring the pulp. The grains of starch from the ruptured\r\ncells are washed away by the water and carried through the meshes of\r\nthe fabric, while the remnants of the cell-walls, being too large to\r\npass through, stay behind in the filter.\r\n\r\n“Thus I obtain a glassful of turbid water. Look at it under a bright\r\nsun. In the water a multitude of white satiny specks are falling like\r\nso much snow and piling up on the bottom. In a few moments the deposit\r\nhas settled. I then throw away the clear water above it and have left a\r\npowdery substance, magnificently white, which if pressed between the\r\nfingers creaks like fine sand. It is the starch of the potato, and is\r\nmade up of such fine grains that it would take from one hundred and\r\nfifty to two hundred to equal the head of a pin in size. Nevertheless\r\nthese grains, minute though they are, have a very complicated\r\nstructure, each one of them being composed of a large number of tiny\r\nleaflets folded one over another. The picture I showed you just now\r\nwill serve to give you an idea of these superposed leaflets that go to\r\nmake, all together, a single grain. Now if some of this starch is\r\nboiled in a little water, the successive leaflets of the grain open and\r\nseparate, and the whole becomes an unctuous jelly far exceeding in\r\nvolume that of the starch used.”\r\n\r\nTo prove this assertion, Uncle Paul proceeded to heat in a little water\r\nthe starch taken from the potato, and soon the powdery matter was\r\nreduced to a beautiful pellucid jelly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nUSES OF STARCH\r\n\r\n\r\n“That jelly,” remarked Jules, “looks just like the paste that I make\r\nwith laundry starch. Your potato starch there in the bottom of the\r\nglass has exactly the same appearance as starch dissolved in cold water\r\nfor ironing clothes.”\r\n\r\n“That close resemblance,” replied his uncle, “is explained by the fact\r\nthat potato starch and laundry starch are at bottom the same thing.\r\nBoth substances are chemically known as fecula; but laundry starch is\r\nmade from cereals, particularly wheat, while fecula, properly speaking,\r\ncomes either from potatoes or from various grains and roots.\r\n\r\n“Like the starch of the potato, laundry starch is in the form of\r\nsuperposed leaflets, but its grains are much smaller: ten thousand\r\nwould hardly be enough to make a pellet the size of a pin’s head. And\r\nthere are some still smaller. It would take sixty-four thousand grains\r\nof Indian corn starch to make a pin’s head or, to be more exact, to\r\nfill the inside of a cube measuring one millimeter on a side; and in\r\nthe case of the beet it would take ten millions. You see that in spite\r\nof their excessive smallness, a smallness that makes them invisible to\r\nthe naked eye, the starch grains of the potato are giants in\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\n“It is chiefly by the varying size of their microscopic grains that the\r\nstarches of different kinds are distinguished from one another. In\r\nsubstance and structure they are all alike. Placed in warm water, their\r\ngrains swell, burst, expand their leaflets, and the starch, from\r\nwhatever source, is changed into a glutinous jelly.\r\n\r\n“Starch is the food supply of plant-life. Wherever we find buds that\r\nare intended to develop by themselves, wherever we find germs, there\r\nalso we shall find a supply of starch serving as a sort of food\r\nreserve. Hence this peculiar provision is met with in tubers, bulbs,\r\nbulblets, seeds, and fleshy roots. Now when these buds and germs\r\ndevelop, the starch becomes, in the process of vegetation, a kind of\r\nsugar which, being soluble in water, can be sent to all parts of the\r\nyoung plant and serve it for food.\r\n\r\n“By certain artificial devices this same change of starch into sugar\r\ncan be brought about. The simplest of these devices is the application\r\nof heat, which always enters into the preparation of farinaceous food.\r\nLet us take a few examples. A raw potato is uneatable. Boiled in water\r\nor roasted in the ashes, it is excellent. What has happened, then? Heat\r\nhas converted a part of the starch into sugar, and the tuber has become\r\na sugary farinaceous paste. The same can be said of the chestnut. Raw,\r\nit is no great delicacy, although at a pinch it can be eaten; cooked,\r\nit is worthy of all the praise we can give it. I appeal to you to back\r\nme up in this assertion. Here, then, we have another transformation of\r\nstarch into sugar by the action of heat. Beans, peas, both as hard as\r\nbullets in the dry state and of no agreeable flavor, are unmistakably\r\nsweetened by being boiled in water and having their starch acted on by\r\nheat. Our various farinaceous foods behave in the same way. Ingenuity\r\nbrings into play a more powerful agent than heat alone to convert the\r\nstarch into sugar. It is boiled in water and during the boiling a\r\nlittle sulphuric acid or oil of vitriol is added. Under the influence\r\nof this energetic fluid the starch is changed into a sugary syrup. It\r\nis of course to be understood that this syrup, as soon as it has been\r\nthus produced, is separated from the oil of vitriol which has served to\r\nmake it.\r\n\r\n“The sugar thus obtained is a soft, sticky substance, and almost as\r\nsweet as honey, but very different from ordinary sugar, which is solid\r\nand comes in beautiful white loaves. [3] It is called starch-sugar or\r\nglucose. Confectioners use it a great deal. When you crunch a\r\nsugar-plum—and I am persuaded that you do not underestimate the\r\nexcellence of sugar-plums—do you know what you are eating? A\r\ncomposition of starch and starch-sugar. I pass over the almond in the\r\ncenter; that is beside the question.”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say,” demanded Jules, “that a bag of sugar-plums comes\r\nfrom such stuff as potatoes and oil of vitriol?”\r\n\r\n“Such is undoubtedly the origin of the delicious sugar-plum,” was the\r\nreply; “and indeed many of the delicacies of the pastry-cook, of the\r\nconfectioner, and of the manufacturer of refreshing beverages, which\r\nyou believe to be sweetened with ordinary sugar, really owe their sweet\r\ntaste to syrup made from starch—a much cheaper product than sugar. You\r\nsee the potato furnishes something else besides the modest dishes with\r\nwhich it supplies our table.\r\n\r\n“Nor is that the whole story. Starch-sugar, or glucose, is exactly the\r\nsame as the sugar of ripe grapes. With potato-flour, water, and a few\r\ndrops of oil of vitriol there is artificially produced, in enormous\r\nboilers, the same sugary substance that the vine produces in its\r\nbunches of grapes with the help of the sun’s rays. Now grape sugar\r\nturns to alcohol by fermenting. Glucose must undergo a similar change.\r\nAnd, as a matter of fact, in northern countries too cold to admit of\r\nthe cultivation of the vine, alcoholic liquors are made from starch\r\npreviously changed into sugar. On account of their origin these liquors\r\ngo under the general name of potato-brandy. All seeds and roots rich in\r\nstarch can be used in similar manufacture.\r\n\r\n“Beer is a product of this sort. First barley is made to germinate by\r\nbeing kept moist and warm. In the process of germination the starch is\r\nchanged into glucose for the nourishment of the young shoots. When the\r\nlittle plants begin to develop, the grain is dried and ground to flour.\r\nThis mixed with water furnishes a sugary liquid which ferments, turning\r\npartly to alcohol and finally becoming beer.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF THE POTATO\r\n\r\n\r\n“Next to wheat no plant in our part of the world is of so much\r\nimportance for food as the potato. Its use was not introduced into this\r\ncountry until toward the end of the eighteenth century. The first\r\nappearance of the potato among our people is a curious piece of\r\nhistory. Why should I not relate it to you? It will show you what noble\r\nefforts and perseverance are sometimes necessary to bring about the\r\nadoption, on the part of those wedded to blind routine, of the\r\nsimplest, most natural idea, and one so rich in future possibilities.\r\n\r\n“The potato is native to South America; it came to us from the high\r\nplains of Colombia, Chile, and Peru. Its first appearance in Europe\r\ndates from 1565. A century and a half later the potato flourished in\r\nEngland. Its introduction into general use in France was slower. The\r\nfirst dish of potatoes, then a high-priced rarity, was served at the\r\ntable of King Louis XIII in 1616.\r\n\r\n“The royal dish is to-day at the command of the poorest; but this was\r\nnot effected without a good deal of trouble, as you will see. For a\r\nlong time the American tuber remained in our country a simple object of\r\ncuriosity to which were attributed injurious properties, and which\r\nagriculture would have nothing to do with. Finally, toward the end of\r\nthe eighteenth century a worthy man succeeded in overcoming these\r\nprejudices and popularized the culture of this valuable food plant. His\r\nname is Parmentier. Remember this venerated name, my friends; he who\r\nbore it banished famine by making the potato supply the deficiency of\r\nwheat.\r\n\r\n“Parmentier communicated his ideas to Louis XVI. ‘The potato,’ said he,\r\n‘is bread already made and requiring neither miller nor baker. Take it\r\njust as it comes out of the ground and bake it in hot ashes or cook it\r\nin boiling water, and you will have a farinaceous food rivaling wheat.\r\nPoor land unfit for other crops will raise it, and it will henceforth\r\nrelieve us of all fear of those terrible dearths that France has so\r\noften suffered in the past.’\r\n\r\n“Louis XVI listened to this proposal with eager attention, but the\r\ndifficulty was to make others listen also. In order to interest the\r\nworld of fashion in the culture of the disdained tuber the king\r\nappeared at a public festival one day with a large bouquet of potato\r\nblossoms in his hand. Curiosity was aroused at the sight of these white\r\nflowers tinged with violet and set off by the dark green of the leaves.\r\nThey were talked of at court and in town; florists made imitations of\r\nthem for their artificial bouquets; in ornamental gardens they were\r\nused for the borders; and as the surest way to royal favor the nobles\r\nsent potatoes to their tenant farmers with orders to plant and\r\ncultivate them.”\r\n\r\n“Behold the potato fairly started on the right road!” interposed Jules.\r\n“It cannot fail to become popular now, under the protection of king and\r\ncourt.”\r\n\r\n“Not so fast, my little friend. Persuasion is a good deal better than\r\ncommand. The tubers patronized by royalty were thrown on the dunghill.\r\nAt most, here and there a farmer, afraid of being reprimanded, allowed\r\nthem to grow as best they could in some neglected corner.”\r\n\r\n“And then?”\r\n\r\n“Then the only thing to do was to convince, not the nobleman who cared\r\nnothing for the potato except as a means for winning the king’s favor,\r\nbut the peasant himself directly interested in this affair. It was\r\nnecessary to overcome his repugnance, a repugnance that made him reject\r\nthe potato even as fodder for cattle; he must be taught by his own\r\nexperience that the tuber of ill repute, far from being a poison, is\r\nexcellent food. All this Parmentier thoroughly understood and he set to\r\nwork without delay.”\r\n\r\n“This time he is sure to succeed.”\r\n\r\n“Not at first and not without great pains. In the suburbs of Paris he\r\nbought or rented for farming large tracts of land which he caused to be\r\nplanted with potatoes. The first year the harvest was sold at a very\r\nlow price. A few people bought some.”\r\n\r\n“Now we are nearing the goal.”\r\n\r\n“Not yet. Good is not accomplished so easily. The second year the\r\npotatoes were given away for nothing. Nobody wanted them.”\r\n\r\n“And Parmentier was left with the whole crop on his hands?”\r\n\r\n“The excellent man could not find a welcome for a single basket of\r\npotatoes. In the country they laughed maliciously at his obstinacy in\r\ncultivating a vile root that no peasant would even feed to his pigs.\r\nBut Parmentier did not despair. A singular idea came to him: to see\r\nwhether the charm of forbidden fruit would not accomplish what he had\r\nfailed to effect by his writings, his advice, his personal example, and\r\nhis generous offers.\r\n\r\n“A large field was planted with potatoes, and when the crop was ripe a\r\nfence was built about the field as if to protect a most valuable\r\nharvest. And more than this, Parmentier caused it to be trumpeted\r\nabroad throughout the neighboring villages that it was expressly\r\nforbidden to touch the potatoes under penalty of all the rigors of the\r\nlaw against marauders. During the day the guards kept strict watch over\r\nthe field, and woe betide whoever should try to climb over the fence!”\r\n\r\n“It seems to me,” said Emile, “that with all those prohibitions and\r\nguards and fences Parmentier was more likely than ever to have all his\r\npotatoes to himself.”\r\n\r\n“Such was not his purpose; far from it. The guards kept good watch\r\nduring the day, but they had orders to stay at home at night and leave\r\nunmolested any who might attempt to get into the field. ‘What, then, is\r\nthis plant that is guarded with such jealous care?’ the peasants asked\r\none another, attracted by the strictness of the prohibitory measures.\r\n‘It must be very precious. Let us try to get some when the night is\r\ndark.’\r\n\r\n“Some bold marauders climbed the fence, hastily pulled up a dozen\r\ntubers, and scampered off again, looking back to make sure they were\r\nnot pursued. Not a guard was to be seen. Word soon spread that the\r\nfield was not guarded at night. Then the pillage began in earnest: the\r\ntubers hitherto so despised were carried off by sackfuls. In a few days\r\nthere was not a potato left in the ground.\r\n\r\n“People came and told Parmentier of the devastation of his field. The\r\nworthy man wept for joy; the one robbed blessed his robbers. By his\r\nruse he had endowed his country with an inestimable food-supply; for,\r\nonce placed in the hands of those who would consent to cultivate it,\r\nthe potato was valued at its true worth and spread rapidly.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, what a curious story!” cried Louis, when Uncle Paul had finished;\r\n“what a curious story! Who would have thought it took all that trouble\r\nto make people accept a food that to-day is of such value to us? Is it,\r\nthen, so very hard to spread a good idea when it is new?”\r\n\r\n“Very hard indeed,” replied Uncle Paul, “as those well know who make it\r\ntheir mission to fight against prejudice and ignorance.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nASCENDING SAP\r\n\r\n\r\n“Now let us see how the plant is nourished by the various substances of\r\nwhich we have just studied the most important. Every form of plant-life\r\nis made up, not of a compact and uniform mass of matter with no\r\noccasional empty spaces, but, on the contrary, with the aid of a\r\nmicroscope it is seen that an infinite number of very minute cavities\r\ncalled cells are interspersed throughout the body of the plant. These\r\ncells may be regarded as extremely small closed sacs, sometimes round,\r\nsometimes oval, but more often with irregular and angular outlines by\r\nreason of the mutual pressure exerted by the cells. The cell-wall is\r\ncomposed of an excessively fine membrane. In the pith of the elder, all\r\nriddled like a sponge, you have an example of cells large enough to be\r\nseen without a microscope. Other cavities are long, pointed at both\r\nends and swollen in the middle like a spindle. They are called fibers.\r\nStill others form canals of uniform size throughout, as fine as a hair\r\nand long enough to extend from the roots to the topmost leaves. These\r\ncanals are called ducts. Look closely at the cross-section of a very\r\ndry vine-branch, and you will see a multitude of orifices into which it\r\nwould be possible to thrust a hair. Those are the openings into so many\r\nbroken ducts. Everything in the plant, absolutely everything—root,\r\nstalk, wood, bark, leaves, flowers, fruit, seeds, no matter what—is\r\ncomposed of a mass of cells, fibers, and ducts.\r\n\r\n“That understood, let us consider the root of the plant. In its new\r\nparts, at the tip-ends of its finest ramifications, tip-ends that we\r\nhave called spongioles, it is composed of cells just formed and\r\nconsequently tender and fitted for absorbing easily the moisture in the\r\nsoil. Spongioles, then, fill themselves much as sponges would do. That\r\ndone, conduits offer their services for conveying the liquid to the top\r\nof the plant: they are the ducts just referred to, and comparable here\r\nto the water-pipes in our own fountains. But if in fountains water runs\r\nby its own weight, going from the highest to the lowest point, it is\r\nnot so with the liquid absorbed by the roots, a liquid running from\r\nbelow upward. What then is the force that makes it ascend?\r\n\r\n“This force is in the buds or, to speak more correctly, in the leaves.\r\nEach leaf is the seat of an active evaporation whose object is to rid\r\nthe plant of the great quantity of water required for dissolving in the\r\nsoil and then conveying to the leaves the nutritive substances present\r\nin the soil. This evaporation leaves a void in the cells that have\r\ngiven up the evaporated water. But this void is immediately filled from\r\nthe neighboring cells, which give up their contents and receive in turn\r\nthe contents of the next lower layers. From cell to cell, from fiber to\r\nfiber, from duct to duct, a similar transfer takes place at points\r\nfarther and farther away from the evaporating surface, until the\r\ntip-ends of the rootlets are reached, where a continuous absorption\r\nmakes good the loss of moisture by evaporation. The process reminds one\r\nsomewhat of the working of our pumps, in which the piston leaves behind\r\nit a void that is immediately filled by the water in the pipe, which in\r\nits turn gets water from the bottom of the well. This liquid which\r\nascends in every plant, absorbed by the spongioles of the rootlets and\r\nput in motion by the evaporation from the leaves, is called ascending\r\nsap, or crude sap. The sap is called ascending because it passes from\r\nbelow upward, from the roots to the branches; and it is called crude\r\nbecause it has not yet undergone the preparation that will turn it into\r\nthe nutritive liquid of the plant. Thus we have learned our first\r\nlesson, namely: ascending sap is carried especially to those parts of\r\nthe plant where buds are numerous, where leaves abound; it seeks by\r\npreference the ends of the branches, where evaporation is most active.\r\n\r\n“We know that the surface wood is the newest; it is formed of cells,\r\nfibers, and ducts whose cavities are free and whose walls are\r\npermeable. The interior wood is older; its cells, fibers, and ducts are\r\nencrusted, stopped up, decrepit, out of use. The liquid accordingly\r\nmakes its way where circulation is possible, and ceases to flow where\r\nthe passage is obstructed. That is to say, the ascent of the sap takes\r\nplace through the sap-wood and chiefly through the outermost layers, or\r\nthose of most recent formation. Repeated experiment leaves no doubt on\r\nthis point. When a tree is cut down at the time of the sap’s greatest\r\nactivity, we find the sap-wood moist and the older wood perfectly dry.\r\nFinally, in herbaceous plants the sap ascends through the whole body of\r\nthe stem. Suspended during the winter on account of the absence of\r\nfoliage, this ascent of the sap becomes remarkably brisk at the\r\nawakening of vegetation. Then it is that fruit-trees shed tears, so to\r\nspeak, where the pruning-hook has left its mark; or, in other words,\r\nthe ascending sap oozes from the openings of the severed ducts. These\r\ntears are especially noticeable in the grape-vine, where it has\r\nrecently been trimmed.\r\n\r\n“Now what would you expect to find in this liquid if you collected some\r\nof it as it trickles in the form of tears either from the vine or from\r\na fruit-tree? Many things, doubtless, you will say, since this precious\r\nliquid is the prime source of all that the plant contains in itself. If\r\nsuch is your thought, undeceive yourselves: ascending sap is little\r\nmore than clear water, and often it is very difficult for science to\r\nprove beyond a doubt the presence in it of various substances in\r\nsolution, so minute a fraction of the whole do they compose. Among\r\nthese substances the most frequent are compounds of potash, of lime, of\r\ncarbonic acid gas, traces of phosphates, and compounds of nitrogen or\r\nammonia. In short, the liquid from which the plant is to derive its\r\nnourishment is the weakest sort of broth, composed of an enormous\r\nquantity of water and a very small proportion of dissolved substances.\r\nThese inconsiderable substances are the only or almost the only things\r\nutilized by the plant; and the water that has collected them in\r\nfiltering through the soil, and has then carried them from the roots to\r\nthe leaves through the sap-wood, the water that forms almost the whole\r\nof the ascending sap, is destined, as soon as the journey is\r\naccomplished, to leave the plant and return as vapor to the atmosphere\r\nwhence it descended in the form of rain.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nDESCENDING SAP\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ascending sap, a liquid composed of a large quantity of water and a\r\nvery small proportion of dissolved nutritive substances, is absorbed in\r\nthe ground by the roots and carried to the leaves through the sap-wood.\r\nIt is not yet a nutritive fluid for the plant; it becomes so in the\r\nfoliage by a double process. First, on being distributed to the leaves,\r\nwhich furnish a vast surface for evaporation, it exhales its\r\nsuperabundant water in the form of vapor and thus concentrates its\r\nusable ingredients. Then, under the influence of the sun’s rays and\r\nthrough the medium of the green matter contained in the leaves, it\r\nundergoes modifications that work a fundamental change in its\r\ncharacter. Among the processes here taking place, one of the best known\r\nis the decomposition of the carbonic acid gas taken from the air by the\r\nleaves and from the soil by the roots.\r\n\r\n“We have seen that this gas, the plant’s chief source of nourishment,\r\nis composed of carbon combined with the breathable part of the air, or\r\noxygen. Under the action of the sun’s light the leaves decompose this\r\ngas, liberating the oxygen in a condition henceforth fit for the\r\nrespiration of animals and for combustion, while the carbon remains in\r\nthe plant, mixes with the substances brought by the ascending sap, and\r\nwith them becomes the nourishing liquid, the descending or elaborated\r\nsap, from which all future parts of the plant are to be formed. This\r\nliquid cannot be called wood, bark, leaf, flower, or fruit; it is not\r\nat all like any of these, and yet it is essentially a little of them\r\nall. An animal’s blood is neither flesh, bone, nor fleece; but bone,\r\nflesh, and fleece are of its substance. Likewise the elaborated sap is\r\na liquid designed for the sustenance of all parts of the plant; it\r\ncontains matter for fruit and wood, leaves and flowers, bark and buds.\r\nIt is the plant’s blood; everything in the plant gets from it its\r\nnourishment, its wherewithal to develop. What a wonderful, what an\r\nincomprehensible process its production appears to us! In the crowded\r\nranks of the leaf-cells, where one would suppose everything to be at\r\nrest, what activity, what transformations beyond the reach of human\r\nscience! Liquids swell the cells, ooze from one to another, transpire,\r\ninfiltrate, circulate, exchange their dissolved substances; vapors are\r\nexhaled, gases come, others go; the sun’s light separates what was\r\nunited, unites what was separated, and the raw materials of the\r\nascending sap combine henceforth with the materials of life.\r\n\r\n“The elaborated sap descends from the leaves to the twigs, from the\r\ntwigs to the branches, from the branches to the stalk or trunk, and\r\nfrom the latter to the root, distributing itself here and there on its\r\nway. It circulates between the wood and the bark. It is this sap that,\r\nin the spring, when it is in great abundance, forms between the wood\r\nand the bark a thin layer of slightly viscous moisture and makes the\r\nbark easy to peel from its branch. Which of you in the month of May has\r\nnot taken advantage of this peculiarity to peel off all in one piece a\r\ntube of bark from a very smooth twig of willow or lilac in order to\r\nmake a whistle, trumpet, or other noisy plaything, the delight of boys\r\nof your age?\r\n\r\n“Nothing is easier than to prove the passage of sap from above\r\ndownward. If you remove from a tree-trunk an annular band of bark, the\r\nnourishing liquid oozes and accumulates at the upper edge of the wound,\r\nbut nothing of the sort takes place at the lower edge. Arrested thus by\r\na break in its path, the sap accumulates above the uncovered ring and\r\ncauses there an abundant growth of wood and bark, which piles up in the\r\nform of a thick circular swelling, while below the ring the trunk\r\npreserves its former size.\r\n\r\n“A tight ligature, by compressing and obstructing the passages through\r\nwhich the nutritive fluid has to pass, causes the formation of a\r\nsimilar swelling above the line of stoppage. You may have seen a\r\nsapling, bound too tightly to the stake intended for its support,\r\nstrangled by its own growth if the gardener has forgotten to loose the\r\nband in time. Little by little the trunk swells above this band, which\r\nis finally overgrown by the bark and even hidden within its substance.\r\nIndeed, it is not rare to find a tree with its trunk caught fast in a\r\nnarrow passage, as for example in the crevice of a rock, and swollen\r\nabove the obstacle into an unsightly excrescence. The stoppage of the\r\nsap in its downward course explains this phenomenon.\r\n\r\n“If the tree-trunk is not completely encircled by the stricture, if\r\nsomewhere there is a strip of bark left free to serve as a passage, the\r\nnourishing juice takes this way to get around the obstacle, and so\r\npursues its course to the roots. Then the tree continues to live. But\r\nif the barrier is absolutely insuperable, as in the case of an\r\nunyielding ligature or when the tree has been girdled, the sap cannot\r\ndescend to the roots to nourish them; and with the death of these the\r\nend of the tree is not far distant.\r\n\r\n“An important lesson remains to be drawn from these details concerning\r\nthe circulation of this nutritive liquid in plants. Henceforth, when we\r\nfasten a plant to its prop or supporting stake, we shall be careful not\r\nto tie the string too tight or else to loosen it at the proper time,\r\nsince otherwise we should run the risk of strangling the plant and so\r\ncausing its death.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nTREE-PRUNING\r\n\r\n\r\n“Self-preservation is the first law of a tree’s life, and next to that\r\nthe preservation of its species, which is to be perpetuated by means of\r\nseeds. All this is perfectly natural, for no posterity would be\r\npossible to the tree unless its own existence were maintained in the\r\nfirst place. Accordingly the tree lives first for itself, accomplishing\r\nthis object by covering itself with buds that develop into branches\r\ncovered with leaves. It is indeed on the leaves that the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the plant’s life are based; it is in their substance\r\nthat, with the sun’s help, the descending sap is elaborated, this sap\r\nbeing the nutritive fluid, the life-blood as it were, of the vegetable\r\norganism. The propagation of the species comes next in importance. This\r\nduty devolves on the flower-buds or those that blossom and produce\r\nfruit, in the center of which are the seeds.\r\n\r\n“Thus, left to its own impulses, a tree, if vigorous and enjoying\r\nfavorable conditions, at first uses all its sap in making buds for the\r\nincrease of its own woody structure; it covers itself with stout\r\nbranches and abundant foliage before making up its mind to blossom.\r\nLater, when its limbs are strong and the ardor of growth begins to\r\nabate, the flower-buds appear, but usually in small numbers because a\r\nprodigal production of fruit causes rapid decline. Copious blossoming\r\ncomes only toward the latter part of life; a tree never blossoms better\r\nthan when it is about to die, as if, foreseeing its end, it strove\r\nbefore succumbing to leave behind it a numerous progeny. A thriving\r\ntree blossoms little or not at all; a sickly tree makes haste to\r\nblossom. But it is to man’s interest that a tree should blossom and\r\nbear fruit as early and as abundantly as possible; we demand from it\r\nnot the branches it would give us without our intervention, but baskets\r\nof fruit induced by our care. From this struggle between the natural\r\ntendencies of the tree and our own needs has sprung the practice of\r\npruning, or the art of manipulating fruit-trees so as to obtain from\r\nthem an abundant harvest.\r\n\r\n“Here let us examine the general principles that are to guide us in the\r\npractice of this art. The shape to be given the tree’s superstructure\r\nof branches and foliage is the first question we must consider. This\r\nshape is far from being unimportant; it is, on the contrary, very\r\nimportant, since the circulation of the sap and the distribution of the\r\nsun’s rays, essential conditions to plant-life, are strictly dependent\r\non it. If the tree is left free to develop by itself and to take its\r\nnatural form, the sap from the roots will, under the impetus of its\r\nascent, always seek by preference the highest points, where growth will\r\nin consequence proceed with vigor, while the lower parts will languish\r\nand die out for want of sufficient nourishment. If the branches are not\r\nproperly thinned the central ones, deprived of the sun’s vivifying\r\nrays, will remain poor, puny, more or less blanched. On the other hand,\r\nthe tree ought to fill, as far as possible, the place assigned it, in\r\norder that there may be no unproductive space.\r\n\r\n“These conditions prescribe the tree’s shape. First of all, it should\r\nbe symmetrical, in order that the distribution of nourishment may be\r\neven and no part of the tree be gorged with sap while another part is\r\ndeprived of it. Secondly, the sun’s rays should be allowed to penetrate\r\neverywhere so as to ripen the fruit and facilitate in the foliage the\r\nimportant work of sap-elaboration. To attain these different objects\r\ncustom has fixed upon three principal shapes: the trellis, the pyramid,\r\nand the goblet. In trellis pruning the tree spreads its branches\r\nsymmetrically, right and left, against a wall. The wall serves it as\r\nsupport and as shelter from the wind; it also gives the foliage and\r\nfruit additional heat and light by reflecting the sun’s rays upon them.\r\nWhen pruned to take the pyramid form, the tree has its branches so\r\ntrimmed as to decrease in length regularly from the base to the summit\r\nand to remain far enough apart to admit the light to the center. The\r\nwhole forms a sugar-loaf, a cone, into the midst of which sun and air\r\nenter freely. It is the shape most in accord with nature. Finally, the\r\ngoblet-shaped tree has a certain number of branches of equal vigor\r\ndisposed in a circle around a central space that remains empty and thus\r\nreceives its share of sunlight without hindrance.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nPINCHING—BUD-NIPPING\r\n\r\n\r\n“When the desired shape has been obtained the next thing is to keep it,\r\ndespite all opposition on the part of the tree, which revolts in its\r\nown peculiar fashion; that is, it strives to restore the natural\r\nconformation of its branches. Suppose, for example, that a pear-tree,\r\npruned after the manner of wall-fruit, has grown all out of symmetry\r\nand developed one side more than the other. How shall the two halves be\r\nrestored to correct proportions? How shall the too vigorous part be\r\nweakened and the too feeble part strengthened? Several methods offer\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n“On the vigorous side let us cut back the branches with the pruning\r\nshears, leaving only the base of each with a small number of buds; in\r\nother words, let us cut them very short. On the weak side, on the\r\ncontrary, let us leave the branches intact or cut them very long, thus\r\nleaving them the greater part of their buds. What will come of this\r\ntreatment? Since abundant foliage, the active laboratory of the\r\ndescending sap and also a kind of pump that sucks up the sap and causes\r\nit to ascend from the roots, is the prime cause of vigorous vegetation,\r\nthe weak part, with its numerous buds developed into leafy shoots, will\r\ngrow stronger, while the strong part, with its small number of buds,\r\nwill become weaker. Both effects will tend to the same result: the\r\nrestoration of the desired symmetry.\r\n\r\n“With the ends of the fingers and the help of the thumb-nail, it is\r\ncustomary to pinch off from the too vigorous side the tips of the young\r\nbranches while they are still tender. This operation we may call\r\npinching. The sap that would have been used for the development of\r\nthese branches is diverted from its course and carried toward the weak\r\nshoots, which it renews and stimulates. If the weak side itself needs\r\npinching to arrest shoots that impair the desired symmetry, the\r\noperation is postponed as long as possible, while on the strong side it\r\nis carried out very early. The sap thus turned away from the vigorous\r\nside toward the ailing one has a whole season in which to restore the\r\nlost equilibrium.\r\n\r\n“Instead of limiting ourselves to pinching off the tips of the young\r\nshoots with our thumb-nail, we can suppress them altogether while they\r\nare still tender. This is done as early as possible on the strong side,\r\nonly the indispensable shoots being left. If it is necessary on the\r\nweak side, it is not done until the latest possible moment. This\r\noperation we may style bud-nipping, since the word ‘bud,’ by which we\r\ndesignate the germ of the future branch when it is still enveloped in\r\nscales, applies also for the sake of convenience to the branch already\r\ndeveloped but still young and tender. It is evident that nipping off\r\nthe buds from the strong part tends, even more than pinching, to\r\npromote the desired growth of the weak part. The more branches we\r\nsuppress entirely, the fewer will be left to share the sap needed by\r\nthe branches we wish to strengthen.\r\n\r\n“What turns aside the sap from the part pruned, pinched, or nipped,\r\ntoward the part left intact, is evidently the more or less complete\r\nsuppression of foliage. It is primarily the leaves that by the\r\ncontinual evaporation of which their surface is the seat determine the\r\nascent of the liquid drawn from the soil by the roots. The more\r\nnumerous these leaves are at any one point, the more abundant the flow\r\nof sap to that point; the scarcer they are, the less the flow of sap.\r\nTo diminish at any point the number of leaves by pinching, bud-nipping,\r\nor any other means, is therefore to diminish at the same point the flow\r\nof sap, which will go in some other direction, to the parts that have\r\nmore leaves and hence a more rapid rate of evaporation to summon the\r\nsap. It is plain, then, that a middle course may be followed between\r\nthe pinching that partly suppresses the foliage of a young branch and\r\nthe bud-nipping that suppresses it entirely. This middle course\r\nconsists in cutting a certain number of leaves from the too vigorous\r\nshoots; and they should be cut clean without tearing, by severing the\r\nstem and leaving its base undisturbed.\r\n\r\n“The easiest way for the sap to run from the roots to the foliage is\r\nfrom bottom to top in a vertical line. Anything that interferes with\r\nthis course hinders also the upward impetus. Thus in branches with\r\nsharp elbows and abrupt bends the rush of sap is slackened just as the\r\nrate of flow of a water-current is diminished by the windings occurring\r\nin its bed. Thus, again, in a branch having a decided incline downward\r\nthe sap moves with difficulty, because its movement toward the\r\nextremity of this branch is in a direction contrary to that which is\r\nnatural to it. The application of this principle is evident. If we wish\r\nto moderate a too vigorous growth of branches, we bend them toward the\r\nground; if we wish to stimulate a too feeble growth, we straighten up\r\nthe branches until they assume a vertical posture.\r\n\r\n“We can also turn to account the exhausting effect of fruit-bearing.\r\nThe more fruitful a branch is, the weaker it becomes, since the use of\r\nsap in fruit means so much the less for foliage, and it is foliage that\r\ninvigorates the branch. Accordingly we will leave the greatest possible\r\nquantity of fruit on the strong part of our tree, and suppress it on\r\nthe weak part.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nMAKING FRUIT TREES BEAR\r\n\r\n\r\n“If one side of a tree is pruned very short and the other very long,\r\nthe natural course of the sap is to some extent diverted from the first\r\nside toward the second, which is richer in buds and consequently in\r\nfoliage. We have just seen how this principle is utilized to check the\r\ngrowth of too vigorous a part in order to stimulate that of one that is\r\ntoo feeble and thus redress the balance between the two. But what would\r\nbe the result if the whole tree were pruned at once?\r\n\r\n“Let us first see what takes place in a single branch. Pruned long, it\r\npreserves the greater part of its buds, all of which call for\r\nnourishment from the sap flowing in that direction; pruned short, it\r\nkeeps only a few buds, which having the sap of the entire branch at\r\ntheir disposal, will receive each a supply that is superabundant in\r\nproportion to the fewness of the buds. For example, what twelve would\r\nordinarily have had for consumption, two or three will now have to\r\nthemselves; and because of this superabundance of nourishment each bud\r\nwill develop much more vigorously than it would otherwise have done.\r\nHence if the whole tree is pruned with an unsparing hand, all the sap\r\ndrawn from the soil by the roots, having no longer a tendency to go to\r\none side rather than the other, will be distributed evenly; and the few\r\nbuds left intact by the pruning-shears will show a luxuriance of growth\r\nin proportion to the supply of nourishment placed at their disposal.\r\nThus thorough pruning applied to the whole tree has the effect of\r\ngiving it new vigor, of rejuvenating it in some measure, or, in other\r\nwords, of replacing its worn-out branches with vigorous ones.\r\nAccordingly when a tree has become exhausted by abundant fruit-bearing,\r\nit is pruned without stint one year in order to restore its vigor of\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n“Let us now see what we should do if we had quite the opposite end in\r\nview; that is, if we wished to make a tree blossom and bear fruit. Here\r\ntwo principles will serve us as guides. First, in the fulness of its\r\nvigor a tree puts forth long branches and thick foliage, but does not\r\ncover itself with blossoms, bearing in fact only a few. It is not until\r\nit has become somewhat enfeebled that it begins to flower in profusion.\r\nSecondly, what would in the tree’s youthful strength have been a\r\nbranch-producing bud becomes in its enfeeblement a flower-bud; so that\r\na flower may be regarded as a branch which, instead of developing\r\nfreely and covering itself with leaves, has remained stunted, thrown\r\nback upon itself, for lack of vigor, and has exchanged its leaves for\r\nfloral organs,—sepals, petals, stamens, pistils. Weaken a tree and you\r\nweaken the buds; such, in a word, is the prevailing principle.\r\n\r\n“To weaken the buds individually, the pruning-shears will be plied but\r\nsparingly, leaving the buds almost intact; then these, being many in\r\nnumber, will have so much the less for each one separately, and some of\r\nthem, especially toward the lower part of the branch, will find\r\nthemselves too feeble to contend with the others and therefore will\r\ntake the form of flower-buds, whereas they would have produced branches\r\nand not flowers if a more thorough pruning had rid them of their\r\nrivals.\r\n\r\n“To weaken the tree as a whole, all that we have to do is to pinch off\r\nor cut off with the thumb-nail the tender tips of the young branches;\r\nthen we bend these branches back so as to give them a number of crooks\r\nand turns that will impede the circulation of the sap. Finally, the\r\nwoody branches of the preceding year are broken by the hand, sometimes\r\nwholly, sometimes half, so that the tip is left hanging down. If the\r\ntree is not too vigorous these three methods, pinching, bending, and\r\nbreaking, are generally sufficient to make it bear.\r\n\r\n“But when we have to do with very exuberant vegetation, more energetic\r\nmethods are necessary. One of these we may call arching. The branches\r\nare all bent down so that each forms an arch; that is, the tip-end of\r\neach is pulled down to the ground and fastened there in any way that\r\nmay be easiest. This abnormal position of the branch, with its top\r\ndownward, is contrary to the ascending movement of the sap, which\r\nconsequently flows less freely to the buds. The resulting dearth is\r\nconducive to fruit-bearing, and as soon as this effect is assured the\r\nbranches are allowed to return to their natural position; otherwise the\r\ntree would become exhausted.\r\n\r\n“Another method is as follows. Pruning is done very late, when the\r\nyoung shoots are already some centimeters long. The sap used up in the\r\ngrowth of the shoots cut off by the pruning shears is a great loss to\r\nthe tree, which, being no longer able to supply ample nourishment to\r\nthe lower buds of the branches, turns them into flower-buds.\r\n\r\n“If these means do not suffice to make the tree bear fruit, there are\r\nmore violent ones which are employed only in the last extremity. Toward\r\nthe end of winter, before the sap has started, an incision some\r\nmillimeters wide and deep enough to penetrate the outer layers of wood\r\nis made all around the base of the trunk. Sap, as we know, ascends\r\nthrough these exterior layers, the newest, the most permeable by\r\nliquids; so if we partially intercept its passage it will flow less\r\nabundantly to the buds and the weakened tree will soon begin to bear.\r\n\r\n“Still another expedient is to strike at the very source of the sap,\r\nthe roots. The foot of the tree is laid bare in the springtime, its\r\nmain roots being denuded of their covering and left thus exposed all\r\nsummer to the open air and the hot sun. No longer enjoying the coolness\r\nand darkness necessary to their office, they furnish less nourishment\r\nto the tree, and this scarcity causes the formation of flower-buds. A\r\nstill more drastic method, but one that would kill the tree if employed\r\nimprudently, is to strip the roots of the refractory subject without\r\nmercy, cutting and mutilating a certain number of them and then putting\r\nback the earth that has been removed. A diminution in the flow of sap\r\nmust necessarily result from this surgical operation. Finally, if the\r\ntree is small enough for the purpose, it is dug up at the end of\r\nautumn, with care to preserve the roots as far as possible, and planted\r\nagain somewhere else. The disturbance caused by this change of place\r\nsuffices to make the tree blossom the next year.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nTHE SEED\r\n\r\n\r\n“The ovary of the flower, after being fertilized by the pollen, becomes\r\nthe fruit, the apple on the apple-tree, the cherry on the cherry-tree,\r\nthe walnut on the walnut-tree, the grain of wheat in the wheat-ear, and\r\nso on for all plants. The fruit contains seeds in greater or less\r\nnumber, and sometimes only one, as in the peach, plum, and almond;\r\noften several, as in the apple and pear; while in other instances they\r\ncan be counted by hundreds and thousands, as in the melon, the pumpkin,\r\nand the poppy-head. The natural function of the fruit is first to\r\nsupply nourishment and then to protect its seeds by means of coverings,\r\nthese being sometimes fleshy, sometimes thin and dry, sometimes hard\r\nand in the form of strong shells. In their turn the seeds have as their\r\ntask the propagating of the species. Every form of plant-life, from the\r\ngiants of the forest, the oak, beech, fir, and others, to the tiniest\r\nmoss, has its beginning in the seed. Every plant has its flowers, its\r\nfruit, and its seeds. It is in the seed that vegetation is preserved in\r\na thriving condition through the ages; it is by the seed that every\r\ntree, every shrub, every blade of grass propagate their kind and leave\r\na numerous progeny.\r\n\r\n“Who would not like to know,” continued Uncle Paul, “something about\r\nthe formation of the seed that is sown in the ground to become either a\r\nlittle plant or an enormous tree? What is inside it? How can an oak\r\ncome from an acorn and a pear-tree from the pip of a pear? I will try,\r\nmy friends, to satisfy the very natural curiosity such a mystery cannot\r\nfail to arouse in you.\r\n\r\n“Let us look at the fruit of an almond-tree. First it has an outside\r\nskin, green and tender, which at maturity opens of its own accord,\r\ndries up, folds back, and lets its contents out. Examining the latter,\r\nwe find a shell, sometimes fragile enough to be broken with the teeth,\r\nbut at other times very hard and yielding only to the hammer. Breaking\r\nthe shell, we come to the seed. Of what use are the two parts we have\r\njust removed? We must be very stupid if we cannot recognize in them the\r\ncoverings intended to protect the seed, the wrappings that shelter the\r\ndelicate germ from cold, heat, rain, and the teeth of animals. The\r\nouter envelope, covered with a short, velvety down, serves as a\r\nprotection against the weather; the inner one is a veritable strong-box\r\nwhich we have to break between two stones before we can get at its\r\ncontents. Similar means of defense are found in all fruit, but with\r\nwide differences in the different kinds of plants. The cherry, plum,\r\npeach, and apricot have the hard shell, the strong-box, of the almond,\r\nand also an outer envelope of juicy flesh. The apple and pear have\r\ntheir seeds or pips, as they are called, snugly ensconced in five\r\nlittle cavities grouped in the shape of a five-pointed star, as may be\r\nseen in a cross-section of the fruit. These little cavities have walls\r\nof a tough, scaly material somewhat resembling horn, while all about\r\nthem is a thick rampart of flesh. Beans and peas are arranged in a sort\r\nof long sheath that opens in two pieces. Chestnuts are packed in a bag\r\ncovered with long prickles. All these protecting coverings, whatever\r\ntheir shape and character and degree of toughness, form part of the\r\nfruit.\r\n\r\n“Let us go back to the almond. The shell being broken, we come to the\r\nseed, which is all in one piece. This seed, as we have just seen, is\r\nprotected by two coverings, the inner one of which is a very firm, hard\r\ncasing called the stone. As a protection is it enough? Not quite.\r\nBeneath the exterior defensive armor comes the fine inner covering that\r\nwraps the seed closely and shields it from contact with the hard shell.\r\nThis covering is double and is composed on the outside of a reddish\r\nskin and inside of an extremely thin and flexible white cuticle.\r\nSimilar double clothing is found on all seeds. The inner one is always\r\nvery fine, as indeed it should be, since it comes next to the most\r\nessential and delicate part of the seed. Do we put coarse cloth, rough\r\nwoolen stuff next to the tender flesh of a new-born babe? Certainly\r\nnot; but rather the finest of linen, and over that the woolen fabric.\r\nThe plant does the same with its tender young seeds. The outer\r\nenvelope, much firmer and tougher than the inner, looks very\r\ndifferently in different plants. In the almond and walnut it is a\r\nreddish skin, and so it is also in the stones of the peach, apricot,\r\nand plum. In the pips of the pear and apple it is a tough brown casing.\r\nIn beans it is smooth and shiny, sometimes quite white, sometimes black\r\nand white, sometimes speckled with red spots. In addition, peas and\r\nbeans of all kinds have at one point on their surface a sort of little\r\noval eye. To this eye was once attached a small short cord that\r\nfastened the seed to the wall of the pod and served as a pipe for\r\nsupplying it with nourishment. All seeds have this attachment, or\r\nnursing-cord, as we may call it, but not all have so clearly marked as\r\nin the bean the eye where the cord is fastened.\r\n\r\n“After the two coverings of the seed have been removed, which is very\r\neasily done when the almond is new, there remains a white object, firm\r\nand savory, the eatable part of the fruit of the almond-tree. That\r\nobject is the seed proper; that is to say, the part that would have\r\nbecome a tree if planted in the ground. It is round at one end and\r\nrather pointed at the other. From the pointed end projects a little\r\nnipple, and all around the edge runs a slight furrow indicating that\r\nhere the seed may be split in two. Let us insert the point of a knife\r\ninto this furrow and exert a little pressure. One half will come away\r\nand the other half will show us what you see in this picture.\r\n\r\n“The little pointed nipple (r) is called a radicle. It is the part\r\nthat, if allowed to grow, would push down into the earth, send out\r\nbranches there, and become the root. At the point marked g is a compact\r\nbunch of tiny leaves, all white, forming a kind of bud, but one that is\r\nmuch feebler and more delicate than buds that grow on branches. It is\r\ncalled a gemmule. This bud will unfold and send forth the first leaves.\r\nFinally, the narrow line of demarcation between the radicle and the\r\ngemmule is called the tigella, and from it the trunk of the tree will\r\ntake its start. Such is the almond-tree in its seed. The large tree\r\nthat will send out a mass of branches and foliage into the air and\r\nthrust powerful roots into the ground is now contained in an\r\ninsignificant corpuscle just large enough to be seen.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nTHE SEED’S FOOD-SUPPLY\r\n\r\n\r\n“When it has leaves and roots that are sufficiently developed, the\r\nlittle almond-tree will nourish itself by drawing what it needs from\r\nthe earth and air. But until then it must live, it must grow stronger,\r\nand it must increase a little in size. As nothing can come from\r\nnothing, the germinating seed must find somewhere the material for its\r\nfirst growth. This cannot be in the soil so long as the radicle is\r\nnothing but a point, incapable of any work; neither can it be in the\r\nair so long as the little leaf-bud has not unfolded and developed into\r\nfoliage. The seed, then, must have a certain supply of nutriment stored\r\nup within itself. Let us turn our attention to this prepared stock of\r\nfood.\r\n\r\n“In the almond we have studied the gemmule or leaf-bud, the radicle,\r\nand the tigella; but there still remain two large pieces, easily\r\nseparable from each other, and constituting by themselves alone almost\r\nthe entire bulk of the seed. These two pieces are the plant’s first\r\npair of leaves, but leaves of a peculiar structure, being very thick,\r\nfleshy, and relatively enormous in size. They are the alimentary\r\nreservoirs, the storehouses of food from which in its beginning the\r\nyoung plant must draw its sustenance. When germination begins, these\r\ntwo large leaves, swollen with nutritive matter, yield little by little\r\na part of their substance to the tiny plant and suckle it, as it were.\r\nThey might therefore be called vegetable udders, nursing-leaves, but\r\nscience calls them cotyledons. The unhatched chick in its shell has the\r\nyolk of the egg to furnish substance for its growth, the young lamb has\r\nits mother’s milk, the germ of the plant has the juice of the\r\ncotyledons.\r\n\r\n“The same structure, with two cotyledons of great size and easy to\r\nobserve, may be found in the broad bean, pea, kidney bean, and acorn,\r\nand in the stones of the peach, apricot, and plum. It would also be\r\nfound in the pips of pears and apples as well as in the seeds of most\r\nof our cultivated plants, but more difficult to distinguish in\r\nproportion to the smallness of the seed. In every instance the seed\r\nwould be found to have two cotyledons as food-storehouses, and also a\r\ngemmule and a radicle united by the tigella. Other plants, on the\r\ncontrary, like maize, wheat, and the other cereals, as also the lily,\r\ntulip, and iris, have but one cotyledon, one nursing-leaf for the new\r\nvegetable organism.\r\n\r\n“It is not always easy, especially when the seed is very small, to\r\nascertain whether it has two cotyledons or only one; but as soon as\r\ngermination has begun, this difficulty disappears. Then the seed with\r\ntwo cotyledons is seen to push up two leaves, the very first to appear,\r\nsituated opposite each other, and very often differing in shape from\r\nthose that come later. In the radish, for example, they are\r\nheart-shaped; in the carrot, long and narrow like little tongues. These\r\ntwo leaves that precede the others are known as seminal leaves. They\r\ncome from the two cotyledons, which generally open in the air and grow\r\ngreen while nourishing the young plant with a part of their substance;\r\nbut sometimes, as in the acorn, they remain hidden underground. On the\r\nother hand, seeds having but one cotyledon come up with only one\r\nseminal leaf, generally narrow and long. This is what we observe if we\r\nwatch the germination of a grain of wheat.\r\n\r\n“A simpler and quicker method may be used for ascertaining how many\r\ncotyledons a seed has. Hold a leaf up to the light and you will see its\r\ntexture traversed by a multitude of little cords which serve it as a\r\nkind of framework. These cords are called veins or nerves. Now then, if\r\nyou compare the leaf of a pear-tree with a blade of wheat, or reed, you\r\nwill see that in the former the veins are more and more subdivided and\r\nramified, joining one another and thus forming a network with irregular\r\nmeshes, while in the latter the veins do not branch, but run in\r\nparallel lines without forming meshes. We should find the same\r\ndifference of framework between the leaves of the elm, poplar, and\r\nplane-tree, on the one hand, and those of the iris, narcissus, and\r\ntulip, on the other. This difference being established, I will add that\r\nwith few exceptions, of no interest to us here, every plant with\r\nnetted-veined leaves has two cotyledons in its seed, and that every\r\nplant with parallel-veined leaves has but one. Consequently it is only\r\nnecessary to glance at the foliage in order to know whether the seed\r\nhas two cotyledons or only one. I will say further that pines, firs,\r\nand the other resinous trees have as many as ten cotyledons, which show\r\nthemselves as a delicate tuft of leaves when the little plant comes out\r\nof the ground.”\r\n\r\nUncle Paul then led the children into the garden to fix in their minds\r\nby observation the lesson they had just learned. “Gather haphazard,”\r\nsaid he, “the first leaves you come to; then examine them and tell me\r\nhow many cotyledons the seed must contain. First, here is the iris,\r\nwith large blue flowers and sword-shaped leaves.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” said Jules, “veins running in regular lines side by side,\r\nwithout ever joining one another. Since these veins are parallel the\r\niris seed has only one cotyledon.”\r\n\r\n“And this blade of grass, this also that I pick from a corn-stalk?”\r\nasked his uncle.\r\n\r\n“They, too, have parallel veins, both of them; and so their seeds must\r\nhave only one cotyledon.”\r\n\r\n“And this grape-leaf, this leaf of the cherry tree?”\r\n\r\n“It’s my turn now,” Emile hastened to interpose. “The veins form a sort\r\nof lace with very fine meshes. The grape and the cherry have two\r\ncotyledons.”\r\n\r\n“It is as easy as that, my friends. The leaf with its arrangement of\r\nveins shows us the fundamental characteristics of the plant. It tells\r\nus whether the germ is fed by one nursing-leaf or two, whether the\r\nyoung plant comes up with one seminal leaf or two.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nGERMINATION\r\n\r\n\r\n“The germ in the heart of the seed is in a state that may be likened to\r\ndeep sleep: its life is, as it were, arrested, suspended. But under the\r\nstimulus of certain conditions it awakens, throws off its coverings,\r\ngathers strength from its stored-up food, unfolds its first leaves, and\r\nappears above ground. This opening of the seed is called germination.\r\nMoisture, warmth, and air are the determining causes; without their\r\ncoöperation the seed would remain a certain length of time in good\r\ncondition for sowing, after which it would wither and lose its\r\ngerminating power.\r\n\r\n“No seed germinates without the help of moisture. Water plays a\r\nmultiple part. First it soaks into the germ and the parts surrounding\r\nit, causing these to swell more than the envelope, so that the latter,\r\nhowever hard a shell it may be, is burst open. Through the cracks of\r\nthis broken envelope the gemmule pushes out on one side and the radicle\r\non the other, and henceforth the little plant enjoys the benefit of sun\r\nand air. Germination is more or less slow according to the degree of\r\nresistance offered by the walls of the seed. If these are hard and\r\nstony it is only with extreme slowness that the germ absorbs moisture\r\nand manages to burst its cell. Therefore, to shorten the period of\r\ngermination care is taken to thin the shells of excessively hard seeds\r\nby rubbing them with a stone.\r\n\r\n“Besides the mechanical part played by water in opening the seed, it\r\nhas still another relating to nutrition. The various changes undergone\r\nby the alimentary contents of the perisperm and the cotyledons in\r\nbecoming liquefied and capable of absorption cannot take place without\r\nthe aid of water. Furthermore, this liquid is indispensable for\r\ndissolving the nutritive ingredients, introducing them into the young\r\nplant, and distributing them evenly throughout. It is plain, then, that\r\nif the seed remains dry it is absolutely impossible for it to\r\ngerminate, and that in order to preserve seeds the first condition is\r\nto protect them from moisture.\r\n\r\n“With moisture there must also be warmth. As a general rule,\r\ngermination proceeds most satisfactorily when the thermometer registers\r\nbetween ten and twenty degrees centigrade, our spring and autumn\r\ntemperature. Outside these limits, be it above or below, germination is\r\nretarded, ceasing altogether in extreme temperatures.\r\n\r\n“The coöperation of air is not less necessary. Seeds might have the\r\nproper temperature and sufficient moisture, but if air were lacking\r\ngermination would not follow. This capital condition explains to us why\r\nseeds planted too deep fail to come up; why germination is much easier\r\nin soil that is mellow and can be permeated by the air than in soil\r\nthat is compact; why delicate seeds should be covered with very little\r\nearth or even simply sown on the surface of the moist ground; and,\r\nfinally, why ground on being broken often becomes covered with fresh\r\nvegetation from the sprouting of seeds that have for years lain dormant\r\nin the soil, needing only to be stirred up and brought into contact\r\nwith the air in order to germinate.\r\n\r\n“Under like conditions of temperature, moisture, and air, by no means\r\nall seeds require the same length of time for germinating. Common\r\ngarden cress germinates in about two days. Spinach, turnips, and beans\r\ntake three days to come up; lettuce, four; melons and pumpkins, five;\r\ncereals, about a week. Two years and sometimes more are needed by the\r\nrose-bush, the hawthorn, and various stone-fruit trees. Generally seeds\r\nwith thick and hard shells are slow in germinating on account of the\r\nobstacle they oppose to the penetration of moisture. Finally, when sown\r\nfresh, immediately after coming to maturity, seeds germinate quicker\r\nthan when old, because old seeds have to recover by a prolonged sojourn\r\nin the ground the moisture lost through prolonged drying.\r\n\r\n“According to their kind, seeds retain for a longer or shorter period\r\ntheir power of germinating; but why this vitality is more enduring in\r\none instance and less so in another, we cannot tell. Neither the bulk\r\nof the seed nor the character of its outside coverings, nor the\r\npresence or absence of a perisperm, appears to decide its longevity.\r\nSuch and such a seed lives for whole years, even centuries, while\r\nanother loses its germinating power in a few months, from no cause that\r\nwe can discover. Thus the seeds of the angelica will not come up unless\r\nthey are sown immediately after maturing; but beans have been known to\r\ngerminate after being kept more than a hundred years, and rye after a\r\nhundred and forty. Excluded from the air, certain seeds may be kept for\r\ncenturies, always ready to germinate whenever favorable conditions\r\nshall present themselves. This explains why strawberry, bluet, and\r\ncamomile seeds from ancient tombs have germinated just as new seeds\r\nwould have done. Finally, rush seeds have been made to germinate that\r\nwere dug up from great depths in the Island of the Seine, the original\r\nsite of Paris. Doubtless those seeds dated from the time when Paris,\r\nunder the name of Lutetia, consisted of a few mud and reed huts on the\r\nmarshy borders of the stream. But despite these remarkable exceptions\r\nlet us never forget that recent seed is preferable to old for sowing;\r\nit comes up better and in greater abundance.\r\n\r\n“We have just seen that certain seeds are very slow in coming up, as\r\nfor example the peach, apricot, and plum, whose thick shells resist the\r\nmoisture required for germination. Put directly into the ground in the\r\nvery places that the young plants are to occupy later, these seeds\r\nwould be exposed to not a few dangers during their leisurely\r\ngermination. Prolonged rains might make them rot; various marauders\r\nthat are partial to them, such as rats, field-mice, jays, magpies, and\r\ncrows, might dig them up and devour them. Besides, they would occupy\r\nfor a long time, with no profit to any one, the ground in which they\r\nhad been planted. All these objections are avoided by making a\r\npreliminary planting after a method known as stratification, from the\r\nLatin word stratum, meaning bed or layer. In a large, deep earthen pan,\r\nwith holes in its bottom, or in any other suitable receptacle, such as\r\na box, a pot, or a tub, likewise pierced with holes, it is the practice\r\nto place first a layer of small pebbles. The holes at the bottom and\r\nthis layer of pebbles are to give easy access to the air and drain off\r\nthe excess of water after each irrigation. Next comes a bed of fine\r\nsandy soil, then a layer or stratum of seeds arranged side by side, and\r\non top of that a second bed of earth. On this is placed another stratum\r\nof seeds, which in its turn is covered with earth; and so the process\r\ngoes on with alternating layers of seeds and earth until the receptacle\r\nis full. Then it is watered and placed in a cellar or a dark shed. All\r\nthat is necessary after this is to keep the contents of pan or tub\r\nsufficiently moist by an occasional sprinkling. Enclosed thus in a\r\nsmall space easy to watch over, with no danger from marauding animals,\r\nand without needlessly occupying ground that might be used for other\r\npurposes, the seeds can now take their own time to break their hard\r\nshells and can germinate with all the slowness natural to them.\r\n\r\n“When the shells at last crack open and the radicle appears, it is time\r\nto proceed to the final planting. The half-germinated seeds are then\r\nput into the ground one by one in an open field, each at the exact spot\r\nthe young plant is to occupy.\r\n\r\n“Stratification offers still another advantage. Fruit trees as well as\r\nother trees have a stout tap-root which bores vertically into the\r\nground to a considerable depth and gives a good deal of trouble if\r\ntransplanting is undertaken. To alter this tap-root into a root not\r\ngrowing so deep, but branching horizontally, would be decidedly\r\nadvantageous. In speaking of the root we saw what the nursery-man does\r\nto obtain this result. He passes the sharp edge of his spade under the\r\nbase of each tree-trunk so as to sever the tap-roots of his young\r\nplantations. In stratification the method is much simpler and success\r\nsurer. With his thumb-nail the gardener nips off the tip of the tender\r\nradicle before the final planting is done. That is all. Deprived of its\r\ngrowing end the young root henceforth branches out horizontally instead\r\nof descending vertically.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nTHE BLOSSOM\r\n\r\n\r\n“Here is the fennel-flower, which, with the corn-flower and the poppy,\r\nis so common in our fields of grain. It is purplish red, while the\r\npoppy is scarlet and the corn-flower, or bluet, is of an azure like\r\nthat of the sky, as its alternative name indicates. On the outside of\r\nthe fennel-flower are five green, firm pieces joined together at the\r\nbottom but terminating in long points at the top. Each of these pieces\r\nis called a sepal, and the five together form the calyx. Inside are\r\nfive other pieces, thin, fine, broad, purplish red in color. Each one\r\nbears the name of petal, and collectively they form the corolla.\r\n\r\n“Most flowers have two envelopes like these, one within the other. The\r\nouter one, or calyx, is nearly always green in color and firm in\r\nstructure; the inner one, or corolla, much more delicate in texture, is\r\ntinged with those magnificent hues that please the eye so much in\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n“The sepals of the calyx and the petals of the corolla are sometimes\r\nseparated from one another and sometimes joined together. In the\r\nfennel-flower the sepals are united below in a common sheath bristling\r\nwith coarse hairs; but in their upper part they are separated into five\r\nnarrow and pointed strips. The corolla we find to be composed of five\r\npieces, five petals distinct from one another. On the contrary, in the\r\nblossom of the campanula the five petals of the corolla are joined at\r\nthe edges and form a beautiful blue bell which looks as if made of one\r\npiece. The five large teeth that border the opening of the bell\r\nnevertheless show that the corolla is really composed of five petals,\r\nof which these teeth are the termination.\r\n\r\n“The calyx and the corolla are the flower’s clothing, a double clothing\r\nhaving both the substantial material that protects from cold and storm,\r\nand the fine fabric that charms the eye. The calyx, the outer garment,\r\nis of simple form, green in color, and of firm texture suitable for\r\nwithstanding bad weather. It has to protect the still unopened flower,\r\nto shield it from the sun, from cold and wet. Examine a rose-bud and\r\nnote with what delicate precision the five sepals of the calyx are\r\nunited so as to cover the rest. Not the slightest drop of water could\r\npenetrate the interior, so carefully are their edges joined together.\r\nThere are flowers that close their calyx every evening and snuggle down\r\ninside to keep from getting chilled.\r\n\r\n“The corolla or inner garment unites elegance of form and richness of\r\ntint with fineness of texture. It is the flower’s finery and is what\r\nespecially captivates our eye, so that we commonly consider it the most\r\nimportant part of the blossom, whereas it is really nothing but an\r\nornament.\r\n\r\n“Of the two garments, the calyx is the more necessary. Many flowers\r\nhave no corolla, but they always have at least a calyx, which in its\r\nsimplest form is reduced to a tiny leaflet shaped like a scale. Flowers\r\nwith no corolla remain unnoticed, and the plants that bear them seem to\r\nus to have no blossoms. It is a mistake: all trees and plants bloom,\r\neven the oak, willow, poplar, pine, beech, wheat, and multitudes of\r\nothers whose blossoming is unheeded by the inattentive eye. Their\r\nflowers are extremely numerous, but as they are very small and have no\r\nbright-colored corolla they escape any but the closest scrutiny.\r\n\r\n“It would be knowing a person very little only to be able to say that\r\nhe wears such and such a coat; nor does one know a flower any better\r\nwhen one can merely say that it is clothed with a calyx and a corolla.\r\nWhat is there under this clothing?\r\n\r\n“Let us examine together a lily, which by its size lends itself readily\r\nto study. It has no calyx, [4] but it does have a superb corolla formed\r\nof six petals gracefully curved inward at the edges, and whiter than\r\nivory. I take away these six petals. What is left now is the essential\r\npart; that is to say, the thing without which the flower could not\r\nperform its function, could not, in short, bear fruit or seed. Let us\r\ncarefully consider this remaining part. You will find it well worth the\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n“First there are six filaments or little white rods, each one\r\nsurmounted by a tiny bag full of yellow powder. These six pieces are\r\ncalled stamens. They are found in all flowers in greater or less\r\nnumber, and in the lily there are six of them. The little bag that tops\r\nthe stamen is called an anther. The yellow dust contained in the anther\r\nis called pollen; that is what daubs our nose when we smell the lily\r\ntoo closely.\r\n\r\n“I take away the six stamens. There remains a central body swollen at\r\nthe bottom, narrowed at the top to a long filament, and surmounted by a\r\nkind of head wet with a sticky moisture. In its entirety this central\r\nbody bears the name of pistil; the swelling at the bottom is called the\r\novary, the filament growing out of it is the style, and the sticky head\r\nterminating this filament is known as the stigma.\r\n\r\n“What big names for such little things! you will say. Little, yes; but\r\nof unrivaled importance. These little things, my friends, give us our\r\ndaily bread; without the miraculous work of these little things the\r\nworld would come to an end.\r\n\r\n“With a penknife I cut the ovary in two horizontally. In three\r\ncompartments grouped in a circle we see some tiny grains arranged so\r\nthat each compartment has two rows of them. They are the future seeds\r\nof the plant. The ovary, then, is the part of the plant where the seeds\r\nare formed. After a certain time the flower withers, the petals wilt\r\nand fall, the calyx does the same, or sometimes it remains to play the\r\npart of protector a while longer, the dried stamens break off, and only\r\nthe ovary remains, growing larger, ripening, and finally becoming the\r\nfruit that contains the seeds.\r\n\r\n“Every sort of fruit—the pear, apple, apricot, peach, walnut, cherry,\r\nmelon, grape, almond, chestnut—began by being a little swelling of the\r\npistil; all those excellent things that the tree and plant give us for\r\nfood were first ovaries.”\r\n\r\n“Then a big juicy pear began by being the ovary of a pear blossom?”\r\nqueried Emile.\r\n\r\n“Yes, my friend,” was the reply; “pears, apples, cherries, apricots,\r\neven big melons and enormous pumpkins begin by being the little ovaries\r\nof their respective flowers. I will show you an apricot in its\r\nblossom.”\r\n\r\nUncle Paul took an apricot blossom, opened it with his penknife, and\r\nshowed his listeners what is here reproduced in the picture.\r\n\r\n“In the heart of the flower,” he explained, “you see the pistil\r\nsurrounded by numerous stamens. The head at the top of it is the\r\nstigma; the swelling at the bottom is the ovary or future apricot.”\r\n\r\n“That little green thing,” Emile exclaimed incredulously, “would have\r\nturned into a plump, juicy apricot such as I am so fond of?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” affirmed his uncle, “that little green thing would have turned\r\ninto an apricot such as Emile is so fond of. A similar little green\r\nthing would have turned into a big juicy pear, into a fragrant apple,\r\nor into a huge pumpkin, so heavy that it rests lazily on its stomach.\r\nTo conclude, I will show you the ovary from which come wheat and\r\nconsequently bread.”\r\n\r\nUncle Paul took a needle; then with the skill and patience necessary\r\nfor this operation he isolated one of the numerous flowers that\r\ncollectively make up the ear of wheat. The delicate little flower\r\ndisplayed clearly, on the point of the needle, the different parts\r\ncomposing it.\r\n\r\n“The blessed plant that gives us bread,” continued Uncle Paul, “has\r\nvery modest flowers. Two poor scales serve it for calyx and corolla.\r\nYou can easily recognize three hanging stamens with their\r\ndouble-sacheted anthers full of pollen. The main body of the flower is\r\nthe plump ovary which, when ripe, will be a grain of wheat. It is\r\nsurmounted by the stigma, which has the shape of an elegant double\r\nplume. Such is the modest little flower that furnishes us all with the\r\nstaff of life.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nPOLLEN\r\n\r\n\r\n“In a few days, even in a few hours, a flower withers. Petals, calyx,\r\nstamens fade and die. Only one part survives: the ovary, which is to\r\nbecome fruit. Now, in order to outlive the rest of the flower and\r\nremain on its stem when all else dries up and falls, the ovary at the\r\nmoment of blossoming, receives an access of vigor, I might almost say a\r\nnew life. The magnificence of the corolla, its sumptuous coloring, its\r\nperfume, all serve to celebrate the solemn moment when this new\r\nvitality is awakened in the ovary. This great act accomplished, the\r\nflower has had its day.\r\n\r\n“Well, it is the dust of the stamens, the pollen, that gives this\r\nincrease of energy without which the nascent seeds would perish in the\r\novary, itself withered. It falls from the stamens on to the stigma,\r\nwhich constantly wears a sticky coating designed to hold it; and from\r\nthe stigma it makes its mysterious influence felt in the very depths of\r\nthe ovary. Animated then with new life, the nascent seeds develop\r\nrapidly, while the ovary swells so as to give them the nourishment and\r\nthe space they require. The final result of this incomprehensible\r\ntravail is the fruit, with its contained seeds all ready to germinate.\r\n\r\n“Let us cite a few of the numerous experiments that prove the absolute\r\nindispensability of pollen.\r\n\r\n“Most flowers have both stamens and pistils; but there are plants that\r\nhave their stamens and pistils in separate flowers. Sometimes the\r\nflowers with stamens only and those with pistils only are found on the\r\nsame plant; sometimes they are found on separate plants. Plants having\r\nflowers with stamens only and flowers with pistils only on the same\r\nstock are called monœcious plants. This expression means ‘living in one\r\nhouse.’ The flowers with stamens and those with pistils do indeed live\r\ntogether in the same house, since they are found on the same plant. The\r\npumpkin, cucumber, melon, hazel-nut-tree are monœcious plants.\r\n\r\n“Where flowers with stamens and those with pistils are found on\r\ndifferent stocks, the plants are termed diœcious; that is to say, they\r\nare double-house plants. Hemp, the locust-tree, and the date-tree are\r\ndiœcious.\r\n\r\n“It is especially in monœcious and diœcious plants that the pollen’s\r\nindispensability is plainly manifest on account of the natural\r\nseparation of the stamens and pistils. Let us take for example the\r\nlocust, a tree of extreme southern France, bearing seeds in pods\r\nsimilar to those of the pea, but brown, very long, and very wide, and\r\ncontaining in addition to the seeds a sugary pulp. Supposing we took a\r\nnotion, if the climate permitted, to grow locust seeds in our garden,\r\nwhat locust tree must we plant? Evidently the one with pistils, because\r\nit alone produces the ovaries that become fruit. But that is not\r\nenough. Planted by itself, the locust tree with pistils will indeed\r\nblossom profusely every year, but will never in all eternity bear any\r\nseeds, for its flowers will fall without leaving a single ovary on the\r\nbranches. What is wanting? The action of the pollen. Near the locust\r\nwith pistils let us plant one with stamens. Now fructification proceeds\r\nas we wish. Puffs of wind, insects that pilfer from one flower and\r\ncarry to another—these convey the pollen from the stamens to the\r\nstigmas, the torpid ovaries spring to life, and the locust pods grow\r\nand ripen perfectly. With pollen, seeds; without pollen, no seeds.\r\n\r\n“Another example. In spots of fertile land in Northern Africa, spots of\r\nland called oases, the Arabs cultivate numerous date-trees which\r\nprovide them with dates, their principal food. Date-trees, too, like\r\nthe locust, are diœcious. Now, in the country of the date-tree, a sandy\r\nplain parched by the sun, spots of watered and fertile land are rare\r\nand have to be turned to the utmost possible account. Accordingly the\r\nArabs plant only date-trees with pistils, the only ones that will\r\nproduce dates. But when they are in flower, the Arabs go long distances\r\nto fetch bunches of blossoms with stamens from wild date trees in order\r\nto shake the pollen on the trees they have planted. Without this\r\nprecaution there is no harvest.\r\n\r\n“But I am coming to an example that will be more familiar to us. The\r\npumpkin is monœcious: flowers with stamens and flowers with pistils\r\ninhabit the same house, the same vine. Before they are full-blown they\r\ncan easily be distinguished from each other. The flowers with pistils\r\nhave under the corolla a large swelling which is the ovary, the future\r\npumpkin. The blossoms with stamens have not this swelling. Well, from\r\none pumpkin vine standing apart in the garden let us cut off all the\r\nbuds with stamens before they open, and leave those with pistils. For\r\ngreater surety we will wrap each one of these latter in a piece of\r\ngauze large enough to let the flower develop without hindrance. This\r\noperation must be carried out before the buds open, in order to make\r\nsure that the stigmas have not already received any pollen. Under these\r\nconditions, not being able to receive the vivifying dust, since the\r\nflowers with stamens are cut off, and since also the gauze wrappings\r\nkeep out the insects that might bring the pollen they had pilfered from\r\nsome neighboring pumpkin vine, the pistillate flowers will wither after\r\nlanguishing awhile, and their ovaries will dry up without growing into\r\npumpkins. If, however, we wish any selected blossoms to fructify in\r\nspite of their gauze prison and the suppression of the staminate\r\nblossoms, we take a small camel’s hair brush and gather a little pollen\r\nwhich we put on the stigma. That is enough, the pumpkin will come.\r\n\r\n“The absolute necessity of pollen for the formation of fruit explains\r\nto us the harmful effect of violent winds and prolonged rains in\r\nblossoming time. Swept away by blasts of wind, or washed away by rains,\r\nor simply spoiled by long-continued moisture, the dust of the stamens\r\nno longer acts on the ovaries, and the flowers fall without\r\nfructifying. This ruin of the harvest from lack of pollen is known as\r\nblight.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nTHE GRAIN OF WHEAT\r\n\r\n\r\n“Now turn your attention to this picture of an ivy seed cut through\r\nlengthwise. Where is the germ or little plant in its egg? It is that\r\nlittle white thing, rather long and narrow, embedded in the substance\r\nof the seed at one end. A fine line marks the division of the two\r\ncotyledons, which are now pressed close together. Next to them comes\r\nthe tigella, or little stalk, ending in the radicle, or rootlet.\r\nNotice, my friends, how small these cotyledons are, how different from\r\nthe enormous nursing-leaves of the almond, acorn, broad bean, kidney\r\nbean, and pea. These poor little plant-udders must soon get dried up,\r\nand if there were no other resources available at the time of\r\ngermination the ivy would speedily starve to death.\r\n\r\n“But look: under the skin of the seed we find a goodly store of\r\nfarinaceous matter, in which the germ is embedded. Almost the whole of\r\nthe seed consists of this accumulation of flour. So here we have the\r\nfood-supply that will supplement that contained in the cotyledons, a\r\nvery insufficient provision in itself. This granary of plenty within\r\nwhich the germ is lodged, this storehouse of food is called the\r\nperisperm. The almond, acorn, pea, bean, with a host of others, are\r\nquite lacking in anything of the sort, having under the skin only the\r\ngerm and nothing more, absolutely nothing. The reason for this\r\ndifference is plain enough. The almond, bean, pea, acorn, with their\r\nbig cotyledons bursting with nutritive matter, do not need a\r\nsupplementary ration; the germ will be sufficiently suckled by the\r\nudders nature has provided in the form of these cotyledons. But the\r\nivy, with its poor little cotyledons, calls for help, and finds it in\r\nthe farinaceous storehouse of the perisperm.\r\n\r\n“Thus a seed may have a double supply of nourishment to meet the needs\r\nof the young plant: that contained in the cotyledons and that stored up\r\nin the perisperm. Cotyledons are never lacking, but the perisperm is\r\nnot found in all seeds. There is none in the almond, acorn, chestnut,\r\napricot, bean, or pea; but to make up for this lack their cotyledons\r\nare of considerable size. On the other hand, buckwheat, chickweed, and\r\nivy, whose cotyledons are small, are provided with a perisperm. All\r\nthis may be reduced to one general rule. Cotyledons and perisperm play\r\nsimilar parts: they both help to nourish the little plant in its\r\ninfancy. So, generally speaking, the seed with large cotyledons has no\r\nperisperm, while the seed with small cotyledons has one.\r\n\r\n“I have just told you that many plants have only one cotyledon. I will\r\nadd that this cotyledon is usually very small. It is especially in\r\nthese plants that the perisperm is present. The grain of wheat offers a\r\nnotable illustration of this truth. Cut lengthwise and looked at\r\nthrough a magnifying-glass, this seed would reveal to us what is\r\nrepresented in the picture I now show you. At the bottom and toward one\r\nside is the germ, forming but a very small part of the seed. At c is\r\nthe single cotyledon, whence will come the first leaf, the seminal\r\nleaf. At e is the gemmule, which will furnish the next leaves. At the\r\nopposite end is a short nipple, the radicle, whence the root will\r\nspring. Now compare the tiny cotyledon of the wheat with the two\r\nvoluminous ones of the almond. The latter, with their rich store of\r\nnourishment, will easily be able to feed the young plant until it has\r\nvigorous roots; but the cotyledon of the wheat, so poor and slender—can\r\nit nourish the young plant? Certainly not. Then the wheat germ must\r\nwithout fail have a storehouse of provisions. This storehouse is the\r\nperisperm (pr), a farinaceous mass constituting nearly the whole of the\r\nseed. This same perisperm, the first food of the wheat’s first shoot,\r\nis also the chief food of man; it is what, under the millstone, becomes\r\nflour, of which bread is made. But how can the farinaceous substance of\r\nthe perisperm nourish the plant? A very simple experiment will show us.\r\nPut some wheat in a saucer and keep it slightly moist. In a short time\r\nthe seed will germinate. As soon as the young sprouts show their green\r\npoints take one of the grains: you will find it softened all through.\r\nYou can crush it between your fingers and squeeze out a white fluid,\r\nvery sweet to the taste and much resembling some sort of milk. What has\r\ntaken place ought not to be beyond your power to surmise from the\r\naccount I gave you of the wonderful change starch may undergo. The\r\nperisperm of the wheat-grain consists chiefly of starch. During\r\ngermination this accumulation of starch is converted into a sugary\r\nsubstance, into glucose in fact. Thence comes the sort of plant-milk\r\nwith which the seed is now swollen. The germ is immersed in this sweet\r\nliquid; it imbibes it, soaks it up almost as a fine sponge would; and\r\nwith the matter thus absorbed it augments its own substance, which\r\nlengthens into root, stem, and leaves. With what furnishes us bread the\r\ngrain of wheat suckles the starting wheat-stalk.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\nCULTIVATED PLANTS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Three modes of plant-propagation are in use among horticulturists,\r\nnamely: layering, slipping, and grafting. To get an adequate notion of\r\nthe great usefulness of these operations let us dwell for a moment on\r\nthe origin of our cultivated plants.\r\n\r\n“You perhaps imagine that from the beginning of time, in view of our\r\nneed of food, the pear-tree was eager to bear large fruit, plump and\r\njuicy; that the potato, just to accommodate us, stuffed its big tubers\r\nwith farinaceous matter; that the cabbage, in its desire to gratify us,\r\nconceived the idea of gathering those beautiful white leaves into a\r\ncompact head. You imagine that wheat, pumpkins, carrots, grapes, beets,\r\nand no one knows what besides, possessed with a great interest in man,\r\nhave always worked for him of their own accord. You think that our\r\ngrapes of to-day are like those from which Noah extracted the juice\r\nthat made him drunk; that wheat, ever since it appeared on the earth,\r\nhas never failed to yield its annual harvest of grain; that the beet\r\nand the pumpkin had at the beginning of the world the plumpness that\r\nmakes them prized by us now. You imagine, in short, that our\r\nfood-plants came to us originally just as we have them now. Undeceive\r\nyourselves: the wild plant is usually of very little nutritive value to\r\nman. His is still the task of so cultivating it as to derive advantage\r\nfrom its natural aptitudes by improving them.\r\n\r\n“In its native country, on the mountains of Chile and Peru, the potato\r\nin its wild state is a poor diminutive tuber about as large as a\r\nhazel-nut. Man takes the worthless wild stock into his garden, plants\r\nit in rich soil, tends it, waters it; and behold, from year to year the\r\npotato thrives more and more, gaining in size and in nutritive\r\nproperties, and finally becoming a farinaceous tuber as large as your\r\ntwo fists.\r\n\r\n“On the sea-coasts, exposed to all the winds that blow, there grows a\r\nwild cabbage with a tall stalk and a few green leaves of bitter taste\r\nand rank odor. But beneath its rude exterior it may perhaps hide\r\ninvaluable aptitudes. Apparently this suspicion occurred to him who\r\nfirst, so long ago that the record of it is lost, took the sea-coast\r\ncabbage under cultivation. The suspicion was well-founded. The wild\r\ncabbage has been improved by man’s incessant care: its stalk has become\r\nfirmer and its leaves have multiplied, whitened, acquired tenderness,\r\nand massed themselves in a compact head, so that we have the crisp and\r\nsucculent cabbage of to-day as the admirable result of this notable\r\nmetamorphosis. There on the sea-coast rock was the first beginning of\r\nthe excellent plant; here in our gardens is its present attainment. But\r\nwhat about its intermediate forms which, through the centuries, marked\r\nthe gradual development of the species to its present high state of\r\nperfection? Each of these forms was a step forward, and each had to be\r\npreserved, kept from degenerating, and made the subject of still\r\nfurther improvement. Who could tell the story of all the labor and\r\npains it has taken to produce the cabbage-head as we now have it?\r\n\r\n“And the wild pear-tree—are you acquainted with it? It is a frightful\r\nbramble-bush, all bristling with sharp thorns; and the pears\r\nthemselves—a most repellent fruit, sure to choke you and set your teeth\r\non edge—are very small, sour, hard, and full of grit that reminds one\r\nof gravel-stones. Surely he must have had an extraordinary inspiration\r\nwho first pinned his faith on this crabbed specimen of underbrush and\r\nforesaw in the remote future the butter-pear on which we regale\r\nourselves to-day.\r\n\r\n“In the same way, by the painstaking culture of the primitive vine,\r\nwhose grapes were no larger than our elderberries, man has, in the\r\nsweat of his brow, developed the luscious fruit of the modern vineyard.\r\nFrom some poor species of grass now forgotten he has also produced the\r\nwheat that to-day supplies us with bread. A few wretched herbs and\r\nshrubs, far from promising in appearance, he has cultivated and\r\nimproved until they became the vegetables and fruit trees so prized by\r\nus at present. This old earth of ours, in order to make us work and\r\nthus fulfill the law of our existence, has behaved to us like a harsh\r\nstepmother. To the birds of the air she gives food in abundance, but to\r\nus she offers of her own free will nothing but wild blackberries and\r\nsour sloes. But let us not complain, for the stern struggle with\r\nnecessity is precisely what constitutes our grandeur.\r\n\r\n“It is for us, by our intelligence and labor, to work our way out of\r\nthe difficulty; upon us it is enjoined to put into practice the noble\r\ncreed, God helps those who help themselves.\r\n\r\n“Thus from the earliest times it has been man’s study to select from\r\nthe countless forms of vegetation at his disposal those that best lend\r\nthemselves to improvement. The greater number of species have remained\r\nuseless to us, but others, predestined no doubt, and created especially\r\nwith a view to man’s needs, have responded to our efforts and acquired\r\nthrough cultivation qualities of prime importance, since our sustenance\r\ndepends on them. Nevertheless the improvement attained is not so\r\nradical that we can count on its permanence if our vigilance relaxes.\r\nThe plant always tends to revert to its primitive state. For example,\r\nlet the gardener leave the headed cabbage to itself without\r\nfertilizing, watering, or cultivating it; let him leave the seeds to\r\ngerminate by chance wherever the wind blows them, and the cabbage will\r\nquickly part with its compact head of white leaves and resume the loose\r\ngreen leaves of its wild ancestors. In like manner the vine, set free\r\nfrom man’s constant attention, will degenerate into the little-esteemed\r\nwild species that haunts our hedge-rows and yields a scant harvest that\r\nwill not, all together, be worth a single bunch of cultivated grapes.\r\nThe pear-tree, if neglected, will again be found on the outskirts of\r\nour woods, once more bristling with long sharp thorns and bearing\r\nunder-sized and extremely unpalatable fruit. Under like conditions the\r\nplum-tree and the cherry-tree will bear nothing but stones covered with\r\na sour skin. In short, all the riches of our orchards will in similar\r\ncircumstances undergo such deterioration as to be worthless to us.\r\n\r\n“This reversion to the wild state occurs even under cultivation and in\r\nspite of efforts to prevent it when seed is used for propagating the\r\nplant. Suppose the seeds from an excellent pear are put into the\r\nground. Well, the trees that spring from those seeds will bear for the\r\nmost part only mediocre or poor, even very poor, pears. Another\r\nplanting is made with the pits of the second generation, and the result\r\nshows still further decline. Thus if the experiment is continued with\r\nseeds taken each time from the immediately preceding generation, the\r\nfruit, becoming smaller and smaller, bitterer and harder, will at last\r\nreturn to the sorry wild pear of the thicket.\r\n\r\n“One more example. What flower equals the rose in nobleness of\r\ncarriage, in perfume and brilliant coloring? Suppose we plant the seeds\r\nof this superb flower; its descendants will turn out to be miserable\r\nbushes, nothing but wild roses like those of our hedges. But we need\r\nnot be surprised at this. The noble plant had the wild rose for\r\nancestor, and in trying to propagate it by its seed we have simply\r\ncaused it to resume its native characteristics.\r\n\r\n“With some plants, let us note in conclusion, the improvement attained\r\nby cultivation is more stable and persists even when the seed is used\r\nfor purposes of propagation; but this persistence is only on the\r\nexpress condition that our vigilance shall not relax. All plants, if\r\nleft to themselves and propagated by seed, revert to the primitive\r\nstate after a certain number of generations in which the\r\ncharacteristics imposed by human skill and care gradually disappear.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT WAYS OF PROPAGATING\r\n\r\n\r\n“Since our fruit-trees and ornamental plants, if propagated by seed,\r\nrevert sooner or later to the wild type, how can they be propagated\r\nwithout risk of degeneration? This must be done by means of the buds\r\ninstead of the seeds. Buds or branches of a plant or tree must be\r\ntransplanted from one stock to another; this is called grafting; or\r\nthey may be planted directly in the soil by processes known as layering\r\nand slipping. These are invaluable methods, since they enable us to\r\nstabilize in the plant the improvements attained after long years of\r\nlabor, and thus to profit by these improvements, which we owe to our\r\npredecessors, instead of beginning all over again a course of training\r\nthat would demand far more than a single life-time.\r\n\r\n“Layering, slipping, and grafting insure the faithful reproduction of\r\nall the qualities of the parent stock. As are the fruit, flowers,\r\nfoliage of this parent stock which has furnished the buds or slips for\r\ntransplanting, so will be the fruit, flowers, foliage of the resulting\r\nplant or tree. Nothing will be added to the qualities we wish to\r\nperpetuate, but on the other hand nothing will be subtracted. To the\r\ndouble flowers of the original from which came the layer, the slip, or\r\nthe graft, will correspond the double flowers of the plant developing\r\nfrom this layer, slip, or graft: the same shade of coloring will be\r\nreproduced, and the fruit will have the same size, savor, and\r\nsweetness. The slightest peculiarity which, for unknown reasons,\r\nappears in a plant grown from the seed, and which sometimes is found\r\nonly on a single branch, as the indented outline of the leaves or the\r\nvariegation of the blossoms, is reproduced with minute accuracy if the\r\ngraft, slip, or layer is taken from the branch having this\r\nmodification. By this means horticulture is daily enriching itself with\r\ndouble flowers or a new shade, or with fruit remarkable for its size,\r\nits early or late ripening, its juicy flesh, its more pronounced aroma.\r\nWithout the help of graft and slip these fortunate accidents, occurring\r\nbut once and no one knows how, would lead to no further profit after\r\nthe death of the plant thus favored by chance; and horticulture would\r\nfind itself compelled to repeat over and over again its attempts to\r\nbring about improvements which, almost as soon as effected, would\r\ninvariably be lost for want of means to fix them and render them\r\npermanent.\r\n\r\n“If history had preserved the record, what long and painful efforts to\r\ndevelop our various cultivated plants from worthless seedlings should\r\nwe not read there! Just think of what a happy inspiration it must have\r\ntaken to select exactly the kind of vegetable or other plant\r\nsusceptible of improvement, what patient experimental attempts to\r\nsubject it to cultivation, what wearisome labor to improve its quality\r\nfrom one year to another, what care to prevent its degenerating and to\r\nhand it down to posterity in perfect condition. Think of all this and\r\nyou will see how the smallest fruit, the smallest vegetable, represents\r\nmore than the toil of him who has raised it in his garden. It\r\nrepresents, perhaps, the accumulated effort of a hundred generations,\r\nan effort indispensable if we are to have a succulent pot-herb as the\r\ndescendant of a worthless weed. We live on the fruit and vegetables\r\ncreated by our predecessors; we live on the labor, strength, ideas of\r\nthe past. May the future in its turn live on our strength both of arm\r\nand thought! So shall we worthily fulfill our mission.\r\n\r\n“It was not chance that gave man the idea of layering, slipping, and\r\ngrafting, but rather the thoughtful observation of nature’s methods all\r\nabout him. He who was first, for example, to note how the strawberry\r\ngrows and multiplies, received the first lesson in layering. Let us in\r\nour turn examine this curious process.\r\n\r\n“From the parent stock of the strawberry vine a number of runners start\r\nout, long, slender, and creeping on the ground. These runners are also\r\nknown as stolons or creeping suckers. After reaching a certain distance\r\nthey expand at the end into a little tuft which takes root in the\r\nground and is soon self-supporting. The new tuft of the strawberry\r\nvine, as soon as strong enough, in its turn sends out long runners\r\nwhich follow the example of the first ones; that is to say, they creep\r\nalong the ground, end each in a rosette of leaves, and take root. The\r\npicture shows us a first tuft, more vigorous than the others. From the\r\naxil of one of its leaves starts a runner whose terminal bud has\r\ndeveloped into a small plant already provided with roots of some vigor.\r\nA second runner sprung from this plant bears a third rosette whose\r\nleaves are beginning to unfold. After sending out an indefinite number\r\nof similar runners the mother plant finds herself surrounded with young\r\nsuckers, established here and there, as many as the season and the\r\nnature of the soil permit. At first these suckers are attached to the\r\nmother plant by the runners, and sap flows from the old plant to the\r\nyoung ones; but sooner or later there is a severance of ties, the\r\nrunners dry up and are henceforward useless, and each offshoot,\r\nproperly rooted, becomes a separate strawberry vine. Here we find,\r\nwithout any of man’s ingenuity or skill, all the details of layering;\r\nand it was undoubtedly the natural process that suggested the\r\nartificial method. A long branch bends down to the ground, takes root\r\nthere, and then becomes detached from the parent stock by the death or\r\ndestruction of the connecting part. The horticulturist lays a long\r\nshoot in the ground, waits until it sends down adventitious roots, and\r\nfinally severs the connection with his pruning-shears. That is\r\nlayering.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\nLAYERING\r\n\r\n\r\n“Some plants, and among them the pink, send out from the base of the\r\nmother stalk straight, pliant shoots which can be used for obtaining so\r\nmany new plants. These shoots are bedded by being bent elbow-wise and\r\nhaving the angle stuck into the ground and fastened there with a\r\ncrotch; then the end is raised upright and held so by means of a stake.\r\nSooner or later the buried elbow sends down adventitious roots, but\r\nuntil then nourishment is drawn from the parent stock. When the buried\r\nparts have sent down enough roots, the connections are cut between the\r\nold plant and the new ones, and each of these latter, set out by\r\nitself, is thenceforth a distinct plant. This operation is called\r\nlayering, and the several shoots used in obtaining new plants are\r\ncalled layers.\r\n\r\n“Let us now put into practice the method we have just been studying in\r\ntheory. In a vineyard, we will suppose, a number of the vines have died\r\nfrom some cause or other, and it is necessary to replace them. Layering\r\noffers us the readiest means and will occasion least delay to the\r\nharvest. Near the place occupied by the dead vine we select a stock\r\nprovided with a vigorous shoot of sufficient length and conveniently\r\nsituated. Then we dig down where the old vine stands and pull up all of\r\nthe lifeless stalk as well as the roots, since these are seats of decay\r\nthat might infect the whole neighborhood. Finally, in the soil thus\r\nstirred we dig a ditch two or three decimeters deep, and in this we lay\r\nthe shoot we have selected, taking care in bending it down not to break\r\nor splinter it. The part thus put into the ground is then covered with\r\na tolerably thick layer of earth, and on this, to complete the filling\r\nof the ditch, is thrown a basketful of manure. The tip of the shoot is\r\nraised upright, tied to a stake, and trimmed in such a manner as to\r\nretain only two eyes or buds above ground. As to the eyes on the part\r\nextending from the mother stem to the point where the shoot plunges\r\ninto the ground, they are nipped off because they would needlessly\r\nappropriate a part of the sap. This operation is called vine-layering,\r\nand the shoot bent down and placed in the ground we speak of as a\r\nvine-layer. The best time for this work is the beginning of winter,\r\nbecause the long rest enjoyed by the shoot in the ground throughout the\r\nseason when vegetation slumbers disposes it to sprout with more vigor\r\nupon the renewal of sap-circulation in the spring.\r\n\r\n“Let us now watch the behavior of the partly buried vine-shoot. If it\r\nhad remained all in the open air, it would have borne fruit; it would\r\nhave had its three or four bunches of grapes. Why should it not do so\r\nunder the conditions imposed by the vine-dresser, conditions that have\r\naltered nothing in its relations to the mother stem? It still remains\r\nin uninterrupted communication with the vine that sustains it; it\r\nreceives its share of ascending sap drawn from the soil by the roots of\r\nthis vine; the buds remaining to it will develop leaves which, with the\r\nhelp of sunlight, will convert this crude sap into elaborated sap; in\r\nshort, it lacks nothing to enable it to function almost as it would\r\nhave done had it not been partly buried. And in fact the vine-layer\r\ndoes bear that same year; if well cared for, it bears several bunches\r\nof grapes. So the proverb says: The vine-layer pays its owner from the\r\nvery first year. Meanwhile, acted on by the coolness and moisture of\r\nthe soil and the stimulus of fertilization, it puts forth adventitious\r\nroots where it has been placed underground, and these roots grow in\r\nnumber and vigor until the time comes when they suffice to nourish the\r\nyoung vine without the help of the mother stem. It is in the third year\r\nthat the rooting is far enough advanced for the young offshoot’s\r\nindependent existence. Weaning is then undertaken, and the nursling is\r\ndeprived of its nurse; that is to say, a stroke of the pruning-knife\r\nclose to the ground and on the side toward the parent stock separates\r\nthe latter from the vine-layer, which becomes henceforth\r\nself-supporting.\r\n\r\n“With its long shoots so near the ground the vine offers every\r\nconvenience for carrying out the operation just described; but as a\r\ngeneral rule shrubs and trees are far less favorably situated: their\r\nbranches are not long enough or flexible enough or (a prime essential)\r\nnear enough to the ground to be bent down and laid in the trench dug\r\nfor receiving the layer. How is this difficulty to be overcome? The way\r\nis very simple. We have already observed the effect of cutting back; we\r\nknow that a stem cut back, that is to say cut off close to the ground,\r\ndevelops around the border of its wound numerous adventitious buds\r\nwhich grow into so many shoots. They are precisely the sort of shoots\r\nwe need, long, flexible, and starting from the level of the ground.\r\nEach of them, if treated as a layer, partly buried in a trench where it\r\nis fixed with a crotch, and held, above ground, in a vertical position\r\nby means of a prop, takes root sooner or later according to its\r\nspecies, and can then be transferred as an independent plant to any\r\ndesired spot. Such is the simple method known both as layering and as\r\narching, because it is essentially the same as ordinary layering and at\r\nthe same time necessitates the bending of the young shoot so as to\r\ndescribe an arch.\r\n\r\n“The following method dispenses with this bending, which is\r\nimpracticable when the wood is too brittle. In the spring the stalk or\r\ntrunk that is to furnish the layers is cut back. All around this\r\ncross-section young shoots soon make their appearance, after which it\r\nis only necessary to wait until they are long enough but have not yet\r\nlost their tenderness, a state most conducive to the growth of\r\nadventitious buds; then the parent trunk is earthed up, or in other\r\nwords light soil is heaped all about the stump so as to cover the lower\r\npart of each shoot. The earth is piled up in the shape of a truncated\r\ncone with a cup-shaped hollow at the top to receive water from time to\r\ntime and thus maintain the necessary degree of moisture and coolness.\r\nKept damp and cool in this manner, the young shoots will before long\r\nsend down adventitious roots, and the following year there will be a\r\ncluster of rooted plants that can easily be detached with a knife. That\r\nis what is called layering by earthing up or by sprouting.\r\n\r\n“If it is found undesirable to cut back the parent stem in order to\r\nobtain shoots for layering, and if at the same time the shoot that we\r\nwish to root is too high to be bent down and inserted in the ground,\r\nthe following expedient may be employed. A flower-pot broken in two\r\nlengthwise or a leaden cornucopia is hung on the tree, and the branch\r\nto be rooted is placed lengthwise in the pot or cornucopia. The pot is\r\nthen filled with mold or moss kept damp by frequent watering, and the\r\nresult, sooner or later, is the growth of adventitious roots. When\r\nthese are suitably developed, gradual weaning is next in order; that is\r\nto say, underneath the pot a slight cut is made, and this is deepened\r\nday by day. The end here in view is to accustom the layer little by\r\nlittle to do without the mother stem and support itself. At last the\r\nseparation is complete. This gradual weaning is no less advantageous\r\nwhen the layers are placed in the ground: it assures the success of the\r\noperation.\r\n\r\n“If the wood is tender, adventitious roots spring without difficulty\r\nfrom the interred part, and the methods already described suffice for\r\nthe success of the layering; but woods of dense structure are more or\r\nless obstinate about taking root, and might remain in the ground\r\nindefinitely without yielding. In such cases our art must intervene,\r\nbased on the plant’s manner of living. Let us recall the effect of a\r\nband drawn tightly about a stalk or trunk. Above this line of\r\nstrangulation the descending sap accumulates more and more, since it\r\ncan no longer continue on its course between the wood and the bark,\r\nthis latter being compressed by the ligature. It accumulates and\r\nproduces a ring-shaped swelling where the plant tries to discharge on\r\nthe outside the superabundance of matter arrested in its passage. Let\r\nthis protuberance be heaped about with fresh earth, and adventitious\r\nroots will speedily be developed to allow the sap to continue its\r\ndescent. A tiny streamlet, running free, follows its channel without\r\neffort and without any undermining of obstacles. But if we obstruct its\r\npassage the accumulating body of water will gain power to open new\r\nvents for itself through the dam. Sap does likewise. Circulating freely\r\nin its natural channel, it is not diverted from its course by any\r\nallurements on its way; and unless the conditions present in wood and\r\nbark favor the growth of new roots, no sap will be expended for this\r\npurpose. But if its usual passage is barred, the sap devotes its\r\nenergies to the formation of adventitious roots in order that it may,\r\nthrough them, resume its interrupted course. A like result follows if a\r\nring of bark is removed from the buried part of the branch or shoot\r\nthat we wish to take root. The arrested sap produces a ring-shaped\r\nswelling on the upper edge of the wound, and from this swelling spring\r\nroots.\r\n\r\n“Now let us apply these theoretical principles. If the wood is compact\r\nand for that reason rebels against the laws of simple layering, we will\r\ntake a piece of wire and strangle (that is the word) the branch we are\r\noperating upon; that is to say, we will bind it tight, but without\r\nbreaking the bark. The compression should be made just below a bud or\r\neye, and about midway of the part that is to be underground. This\r\nprocess is called layering by strangulation.\r\n\r\n“Or again, still midway of the part to be bedded in the earth, and\r\nimmediately under a bud, we cut the bark all around the branch without\r\ninjuring the wood; a second incision is made a centimeter and a half\r\nlower down; then tearing off the strip of bark between the two\r\ncircumcisions, we remove it all in one piece. This method is known as\r\nannular incision from the ring of bark thus taken away.\r\n\r\n“Or as a third expedient, still midway of the part to be bedded in the\r\ntrench, we make with a sharp instrument an oblique incision from below\r\nupward, cutting into the wood as far as the marrow. In this way we are\r\nenabled to raise a tongue comprising half the thickness of the shoot,\r\nand this tongue is held in its lifted position by a small pebble\r\ninserted in the slit. This is what we call a Y-shaped incision, because\r\nthe raised tongue forms with the rest of the stem an opening like that\r\nbetween the two branches of the letter Y. Through the half that remains\r\nintact communication with the mother stem is maintained and the needed\r\nshare of crude sap is received, while from the cut and upraised half\r\nadventitious roots are put forth because the course of the descending\r\nsap is arrested there.\r\n\r\n“In order to bring into contact with the damp soil a greater extent of\r\nwounded fiber fit for putting forth adventitious roots, it is customary\r\nto split the upraised tongue in two and keep the two parts gaping by\r\ninterposing a small pebble. This method of double incision is used for\r\ntrees that offer the greatest resistance to successful layering.\r\n\r\n“To sum up, all these methods and others derived from them have for\r\ntheir object the fostering of adventitious roots by arresting the\r\ncourse of the descending sap at a certain point beneath the soil.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI\r\n\r\nSLIPPING\r\n\r\n\r\n“Propagation by means of a slip or scion cut from the parent tree and\r\nso placed that it will develop adventitious roots we may for\r\nconvenience speak of as slipping. The cut end of the slip is set in the\r\nground in some cool, moist, shady spot where evaporation is slow and\r\nthe temperature mild. For delicate slips the shelter of a bell-glass is\r\noften necessary in order to insure the requisite moisture in the\r\natmosphere and thus prevent the slip from drying up before it has sent\r\ndown roots to make good its losses. For greater surety, if the slip has\r\nmany leaves, most of the lower ones are removed in order to reduce the\r\nevaporating surface as much as possible without compromising the\r\nplant’s vitality, which resides especially in the upper part. But in\r\nmany cases these precautions are needless; thus, to propagate the\r\ngrape-vine, willow, and poplar, it suffices merely to thrust the\r\ndetached scion into the ground.\r\n\r\n“Trees whose wood is soft and well filled with sap are the ones best\r\nfitted for slipping; to this class belongs the willow, with its notably\r\ntender fiber. On the other hand, wood that is dense and hard gives us\r\nsure warning that this mode of propagation will be found very difficult\r\nor even impossible. Thus it would invariably fail with the oak, the\r\nolive, the box-tree, and a great many more hard-wood trees.\r\nFurthermore, slipping offers far less certainty of success than\r\nlayering, since the layer remains in communication with the parent\r\nstock and is thus supplied with nourishment until it has acquired roots\r\nof its own, whereas the slip, all such communication being abruptly cut\r\noff, is obliged from the outset to rely on its own resources and pass\r\nwithout help through the difficult period of rootlessness. Among\r\nfruit-bearers there are scarcely any except the grape-vine, the\r\ncurrant-bush, the quince-tree, and a few varieties of plum and apple\r\ntrees, that lend themselves to this method of propagation. Among the\r\nlarger trees the willow and the poplar take root with no difficulty\r\nwhatever when started from the slip. Finally, a great many ornamental\r\nspecies, herbaceous plants or bushes like the rose, jasmine, and\r\nhoneysuckle, multiply easily by this method, the usual one adopted with\r\nthem by the flower-gardener.\r\n\r\n“Let us go back now to the very simplest case, the one calling for the\r\nfewest precautions. A damp piece of ground on the water’s edge is to be\r\nplanted with poplars or willows. Toward the end of winter the forester\r\nin charge cuts a sufficient number of vigorous young branches as large\r\naround as a stout cane or even a man’s fist, or perhaps larger, and\r\nfrom one to four meters long. He removes all the lower twigs, clips the\r\nintermediate ones to half their length, and leaves the upper ones\r\nintact if the tree is to be pyramid-shaped; otherwise he gives the top\r\na truncate form. Finally the lower end is cut to a point with the\r\nhatchet, to make it easier to thrust into the ground. Now the slip is\r\nready for planting, and all that is necessary is to push it well down\r\ninto the earth by its pointed end and leave it to itself. Without any\r\nfurther attention, if the ground is sufficiently damp, adventitious\r\nroots will start, and each of the stakes thus rudely hacked will become\r\na poplar or a willow.\r\n\r\n“But other forms of vegetation are far from manifesting this facility\r\nin rooting which makes possible the growth of a tree from a stake\r\ndriven into the ground, it may be with the blow of a club; therefore\r\ndelicate precautions are necessary for success if these obdurate\r\nsubjects are to be propagated by slips. Let us take the grape-vine as\r\nan example. Its slips for planting are shoots of the same year’s\r\ngrowth. These are tied in a bundle and their cut ends placed in water\r\nto soak for a week or more. Why this long immersion of the part that\r\nlater is to be planted in the ground? Because the outside bark is dry\r\nand tough, difficult for tender roots to pierce, especially if the soil\r\nis dry. Accordingly the bark is softened by soaking for some time in\r\nwater; and also, when the slips are taken out of the water, they are\r\nlightly scraped where they are to be in the earth, but left untouched\r\nwhere they are to be in the air. In this way the outer layer of bark is\r\nremoved after being softened in water, and there is so much the less\r\nresistance offered to the growing roots; but the inner layers, where\r\nthe vine’s vital activities go on, are scrupulously spared. The slight\r\nwounds inflicted by this scraping, let it be further noted, favor the\r\nstarting of roots by arresting the sap. After being prepared in this\r\nmanner the slips are set out. In soil that has been well worked so that\r\nthe young roots may push downward without hindrance, vertical holes are\r\nmade with a long iron or wooden dibble, and in each of these holes a\r\nslip is inserted to the depth of about half a meter. Fine earth is then\r\nsifted into the hole and well rammed down to insure perfect contact\r\nwith the slip, and the operation is finished.\r\n\r\n“Just as the process of layering is facilitated by the formation of a\r\nring-shaped swelling where the descending sap is arrested in its course\r\neither by a ligature or by the removal of a ring of bark, so the same\r\nartifice can be advantageously employed in propagating by means of\r\nslips. Around the shoot selected as slip for the next year’s planting\r\nan iron wire is tightly bound; or, instead of this, a ring of bark is\r\ncut away. By autumn a swelling will have formed all about the stem,\r\nwhereupon the shoot is detached and placed in the ground for the winter\r\nin order that the swelling may become a little further enlarged and\r\nsomewhat softened. In the spring the shoot is taken up again, trimmed\r\nso that it shall have only four or five buds left, and planted like an\r\nordinary slip. From the ring-shaped swelling caused by the accumulation\r\nof sap roots will start.\r\n\r\n“All the advantages offered by the ring-shaped swelling may be secured\r\nwith no expenditure of ingenuity on our part. Take hold of a small\r\nbranch and pull it down so as to split it off from the main stem. Thus\r\ntorn away it will bring with it a sort of spur or splinter from the\r\ntrunk directly under the severed branch. This spur, trimmed with a\r\nknife to give it a less ragged outline, will render the same service as\r\nthe ring-shaped swelling: the descending sap will be stopped in its\r\ncourse at this point, will accumulate, and will foster the growth of\r\nadventitious roots.\r\n\r\n“Instead of breaking off the branch by tearing it away at its base, one\r\ncan, with a stroke of the pruning-knife above this base and another\r\nbelow it, cut the older limb bearing this branch so that the latter\r\ncarries with it a piece of the former. With this piece as a sort of\r\nnatural bourrelet or swelling, success is rendered more assured than in\r\nany other way.\r\n\r\n“To conclude, let us say a few words about slipping by means of buds, a\r\nkind of planting that uses buds instead of seeds. This method, which\r\nrequires the nicest care of any, is adopted only in exceptional cases.\r\nLet us suppose we have a very few shoots, or only one, from some\r\nextremely rare variety of grape-vine, and we wish to obtain from this\r\nsingle shoot the greatest possible number of slips. To this end the\r\nshoot is cut into small pieces about five centimeters long, each\r\nbearing a bud midway of its length. These pieces are then each split in\r\ntwo lengthwise, and the part with the bud is retained, the other thrown\r\naway. Thus prepared, the pieces are planted in fertile soil with the\r\nsplit surface underneath and the bud just peeping out of the earth. But\r\nto insure any likelihood of success with this method, certain special\r\nconditions not called for in ordinary planting must be observed, as\r\nwill be readily understood. The delicate slips are arranged with care\r\nin an earthen pan or pot, and covered with a bell-glass to assure them\r\na moist and warm atmosphere. After roots have started the slips are\r\ntransplanted, each being placed in a separate pot where it gains\r\nstrength and awaits the proper time for planting in the ground.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII\r\n\r\nGRAFTING\r\n\r\n\r\n“Grafting is the process by which a twig or a bud [5] is transplanted\r\nfrom one branch to another, or from one tree to another. That which is\r\nto serve as support and sustenance to the transferred part is known as\r\nthe stock, while the twig or bud received by it is called the graft.\r\n\r\n“One absolutely necessary condition must be fulfilled if this operation\r\nis to be successful: the transferred part must find on its new\r\nnursing-branch nutriment to its taste, that is to say, a sap like its\r\nown. This requires that the two plants, the stock and the one that\r\nfurnishes the graft, should be of the same species or at least belong\r\nto closely related species, since likeness of sap and its products can\r\nresult only from likeness of organization. It would be a mere waste of\r\ntime to try to engraft the lilac upon the rose, or the rose upon the\r\nwillow, for there is nothing in common between these three species\r\neither in leaves, flowers, or fruit. This difference in structure is\r\ninvariably accompanied by a marked difference in respect to nutrition.\r\nHence the rose-bud would starve to death on a lilac-branch, and the\r\nlilac-bud would meet with the same sad fate on a rose-bush. But lilac\r\ncan very well be grafted on lilac, rose-bush on rose-bush, vine on\r\nvine. And one can even go further than this: a peach-bud will flourish\r\non an apricot-tree, a cherry-bud on a plum-tree, and vice versa; for\r\nbetween the members of each of these pairs there is a close and easily\r\ndiscernible analogy. In short, there must be the closest possible\r\nresemblance between the two plants if grafting is to succeed.\r\n\r\n“The ancients were far from having any clear idea on this absolute need\r\nof likeness in organization. They tell us of grafting the holly with\r\nthe rose to obtain green roses, the walnut tree with the grape to\r\nproduce enormous grapes as large as walnuts. In our own time has not\r\nthe project been seriously considered of grafting a vine shoot on to a\r\nmulberry tree in order to restore vigor to the grape whose roots an\r\nunderground grub has attacked? Such graftings and others between plants\r\ncompletely unlike have never been successfully undertaken except in the\r\nimagination of those who dreamt them.\r\n\r\n“We have already seen that, grown from seed, our various fruit trees do\r\nnot, as a rule, reproduce the quality of fruit of the parent stock; an\r\ninvincible tendency to revert to the wild state causes the fruit to\r\nlose, little by little, from one generation to another, the improvement\r\nit had acquired through cultivation. Thus the pear, through repeated\r\nplantings of the seed, would become increasingly sour, small, and hard,\r\nuntil it had at last returned to the sorry state of the wild pear\r\ngrowing on the edge of the woods. But this defect attending growth from\r\nthe seed is redeemed by one very desirable quality: the tree thus grown\r\nregains more or less the robustness of its wild type; it is\r\nincomparably more vigorous, healthier, longer-lived, than the\r\nartificially perfected tree whose strength is compromised by the very\r\nexcess of its fructification. One has vigor, the other fine fruit. The\r\ntwo attributes cannot go together; if one increases, the other\r\ndecreases. Well then, these robust specimens reared from the seed are\r\njust what we require for grafting. Used as stocks, they supply the\r\nquality inherent in them, namely, vigor; and the cutting engrafted upon\r\nthem furnishes the other quality, excellence of fruit.\r\n\r\n“Accordingly it is the practice to plant the pips of pears and apples,\r\nand the stones of apricots and peaches; and on the trees thus obtained\r\nto graft cuttings from pear, apple, apricot, and peach trees that bear\r\nfruit of recognized superiority. In this way there are united in the\r\nsame tree the root and trunk of the robust and almost wild kind with\r\nthe leaves and blossoms of the weak but artificially improved kind.\r\nEvery variety of pear tree is by nature fitted to receive a pear graft,\r\nevery variety of peach tree to receive a peach graft, and so on with\r\nall fruit-trees. There is no objection to selecting as stock any wild\r\npear, cherry, or plum tree that may have sprung up of itself in hedge\r\nor thicket. It is thus for example that the cherry is grafted on two\r\nothers of like sort, the wild cherry and the cherry of Saint Lucia,\r\nboth frequenters of uncultivated hillsides. The first bears fruit\r\nhardly as large as a pea, black, round, and full of a very dark and\r\nrather bitter juice; the second has still smaller fruit with scarcely\r\nany pulp and uneatable. No matter: with grafts from a suitably chosen\r\nsource they will cover themselves with the finest cherries. In like\r\nmanner our superb garden roses can be grown on the wild rose stock, the\r\ncommon dog rose of the hedges, whose modest blossoms have only five\r\npetals of a pale carnation color and are well-nigh odorless. Sometimes,\r\nagain, two species of similar characteristics are chosen for grafting\r\npurposes. Thus the pear grafts well on the quince-tree, the fruit of\r\nthe latter being, after all, a sort of big pear; the apricot can be\r\ngrafted on the plum; the peach on the plum and, still better, on the\r\nalmond, so like the peach in its foliage, its early blossoming, and the\r\nstructure of its fruit.\r\n\r\n“As a curiosity let us mention the mixing of several kinds of fruit on\r\nthe same stock. By means of grafting the same tree can bear, all at one\r\ntime, almonds, apricots, peaches, plums, and cherries, because these\r\nfive kinds admit of reciprocal grafting; another tree may be covered\r\nsimultaneously with pears, quinces, berries of the mountain ash,\r\nmedlars, and service-berries. These are very odd instances, certainly,\r\nbut of no practical interest. It would be a waste of time to dwell\r\nlonger on them did they not teach a useful lesson. They demonstrate\r\nthat however many fresh grafts are added to a tree, the new-comers\r\nexert no influence outside their own sphere. Whether offshoots of the\r\ntree itself or aliens, the grafts develop, blossom, and fructify, each\r\nafter its own kind, without contracting any of its neighbor’s habits.\r\nAmong the curious phenomena observed in this artificial juxtaposition\r\nof mutually independent grafts, we will mention a pear-tree on which\r\nwere represented, by means of grafting, all the different varieties of\r\ncultivated pears. Sour or sweet, dry or juicy, large or small, green or\r\nbright-colored, round or long, hard or mellow, each and all ripened on\r\nthe same tree and grew again year after year without change, faithful\r\nto the specific character, not of the supporting tree, but of the\r\nvarious grafts planted on this common stock.\r\n\r\n“The mere bringing together of analogous plants does not suffice for\r\nthe success of the operation of grafting; there must be a considerable\r\nextent of contact between those parts of the graft and the stock that\r\nhave the most vitality and are consequently best fitted to coalesce.\r\nThis contact should be in the inner layers of the bark and in the seat\r\nof plant-growth situated between the wood and the bark. The vital\r\nactivity of the plant, in fact, resides especially in this region. It\r\nis between the wood and the bark that the elaborated sap descends;\r\nthere is where new cells and new fibers are organized, to form on one\r\nside a sheet of bark and on the other a layer of wood. Hence it is\r\nthere and only there that coalescence is possible between the graft and\r\nthe stock.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII\r\n\r\nGRAFTING\r\n\r\n(Continued)\r\n\r\n\r\n“There are three principal kinds of grafting, namely: grafting by\r\napproach (also called simply ‘approaching’ or ‘inarching’), grafting by\r\nshoots or scions, and grafting by buds (commonly known as ‘budding’).\r\nThe form given to the two cut ends that are brought together and the\r\ndisposition of the parts thus placed in contact give rise, in practice,\r\nto numerous subdivisions that need not be mentioned here. We will\r\nconfine ourselves to the essentials.\r\n\r\n“Grafting by approach is analogous to layering, with this difference,\r\nthat the tree to be grafted takes the place of the soil that receives\r\nthe layer. In layering we induce the growth of adventitious roots by\r\npartly burying in the ground a branch or shoot still adhering to the\r\nstock that nourishes it. When, acted upon by the soil, roots have\r\nstarted in sufficient number, the shoot is gradually cut loose until at\r\nlast it is quite severed from the parent stock. In grafting by approach\r\nit is also proposed to make a branch, a shoot, a tree-top, while still\r\nunited to its own stem or stock, take root, so to speak, not in the\r\nground, but in the substance of a neighboring tree.\r\n\r\n“Let us suppose that two shrubs are growing close together and that we\r\nwish to engraft on one of them a twig or shoot of the other. The parts\r\nto be placed in contact receive each a longitudinal gash that\r\npenetrates to the marrow, or even deeper, and the two gashes are made\r\nof equal length. These parts are then brought together, care being\r\ntaken to make the young and growing portions in the one exactly meet\r\nthose in the other; that is to say, the inner layer of bark in each,\r\nwith the channel traversed by the elaborated sap, is carefully fitted\r\nto the corresponding part in its neighbor. The whole is thereupon made\r\nfast with a ligature, and the two wounds are left to the slow operation\r\nof vital forces. Fed by its own stem or trunk, from which it is not yet\r\nseparated, the shoot to be transplanted mingles its sap with the sap of\r\nits neighbor; on both sides there are new growths to cicatrize the\r\nwounds, while the two parts gradually coalesce until, sooner or later,\r\nthe graft becomes incorporated with its future support. And now the\r\ngraft must be weaned; that is, it must, little by little, be deprived\r\nof the sustenance furnished by its own stock. This is accomplished as\r\nin simple layering, by gradually cutting through the shoot below the\r\npoint of union. As soon as the graft is thought to be getting all its\r\nnourishment from the new stem, it is completely severed from the mother\r\ntree. This mode of grafting, the most elementary of all, sometimes\r\ntakes place accidentally and unassisted. In a hedge or any dense growth\r\nof bushes, if two branches chance to come into close and prolonged\r\ncontact, there will be at this point, first, a slight abrasion and then\r\na complete wearing away of the bark until the two raw surfaces end, it\r\nmay be, in growing together. It is not improbable that natural\r\noccurrences of this kind furnished man with his first notions of\r\ngrafting.\r\n\r\n“Grafting by approach is an excellent method to apply whenever in the\r\narrangement of a fruit-tree’s branches there is a vacant space that\r\nneeds filling. Regular distribution, symmetry of arrangement, is a\r\ncondition demanded if only to satisfy the eye, which is always offended\r\nby disorder; but there is another and still more convincing reason for\r\nthis regularity. The more evenly a tree’s branches are distributed, so\r\nthat each shall receive an equal share of sap, sunlight, and heat, so\r\nmuch the more fruit will it bear. Suppose, then, there is a lack of\r\nbranches in some part. To fill this gap and thus restore the tree’s\r\nsymmetry, grafting by approach offers a ready means. From a branch near\r\nthe vacant space and itself sufficiently supplied with twigs or shoots,\r\none of these latter, of good length, is selected; then it is properly\r\ncut or gashed and the gash is brought into contact with a similar gash\r\nat the point where it is desired to start a new growth; and, finally, a\r\nligature is applied to hold the two parts together. As soon as\r\ncoalescence is complete the graft is severed below the point of union,\r\nand the lower section, after being straightened up again, is ready to\r\nserve once more as branch to the limb that bears it. In this way, with\r\nno loss to themselves, the more abundant branches furnish offshoots to\r\nthe poorer ones.\r\n\r\n“Grafting by means of shoots or scions cut from the parent stock at the\r\noutset is analogous to slipping. It consists in transplanting on to a\r\nnew stock a shoot detached from its mother branch. The most common\r\nmethod is cleft-grafting. It is done in the spring when the buds begin\r\nto open. Shoots of the preceding year are chosen for grafts, care being\r\ntaken to select those that are vigorous and that have attained no later\r\nthan August the hard and woody condition necessary for resistance to\r\nthe severities of winter. One precaution at the very outset must be\r\ntaken. When the graft is put in place it will be of the utmost\r\nimportance that it shall find in its new position nourishment\r\nproportionate to its needs. It would infallibly perish if it should\r\nprove to be in a more advanced state of vegetation than the stock\r\nselected to nourish it. The latter, therefore, ought to be rather ahead\r\nof than behind the former in this respect. To secure this result,\r\nbetween one and two months before the operation is to be carried out it\r\nis well to cut the grafts and place them in the ground on the north\r\nside of a wall, where they will remain quiescent while the branches to\r\nwhich they are to be transferred will make progress and their sap will\r\nstart.\r\n\r\n“We will suppose there is a worthless pear-tree in our garden, grown\r\nfrom a pip or transplanted from its native wood, and we propose to make\r\nit bear good pears. The course to pursue is as follows. We cut off\r\nentirely the upper part of the wild pear tree, trimming the cut with\r\nour pruning-knife so that there are no ragged edges, since these would\r\nnot scar over readily and might become the seat of a far-reaching\r\ndecay. If the trunk is of moderate size and is to receive but one\r\ngraft, it is cut a little obliquely with a small level surface on the\r\nupper edge, as shown in the picture. In the middle of this horizontal\r\nfacet a split is made to the depth of about six centimeters. That done,\r\nwe take one of the grafts set aside as already indicated, and we cut it\r\nso as to leave only two or three buds, of which the topmost one should\r\nbe at the tip of the branch. Then, just under the lowest bud we whittle\r\nthe end of the graft into the shape of a knife-blade, letting the bud\r\nstand just above the back or dull edge of the blade. For greater\r\nstability when the graft is put in place, a narrow inverted ledge is\r\ncut at the top of the blade on both sides. A glance at the picture will\r\nshow you all these little details. Finally, the graft is slipped into\r\nthe cleft of the stock, bark exactly meeting bark, wood meeting wood.\r\nThe whole is brought tightly together by binding, and the wounds are\r\ncovered with grafting mastic, which may be bought already prepared. If\r\nthis mastic is lacking we can use what is known in the country as Saint\r\nFiacre’s ointment, a sort of paste made of clay, or rather a mixture of\r\nclay and cows’ dung, the fibrous nature of the latter preventing the\r\nformer from cracking. A winding of rags holds the ointment in place.\r\nThus wound, the stump does not suffer from exposure to the air, which\r\nwould dry it up. In course of time the wounds cicatrize, and the bark\r\nand wood of the graft coalesce with the bark and wood of the severed\r\ntrunk. Finally the buds of the graft, nourished by the stock, develop\r\ninto branches and at the end of a few years the top of the wild pear\r\ntree is replaced by that of a cultivated pear tree bearing pears equal\r\nto those of the tree that furnished the graft.\r\n\r\n“The operation of cutting back a branch or trunk to receive the graft\r\nalways promotes the growth of numerous buds. What is to be done with\r\nthe shoots that spring from these? Evidently they must be suppressed,\r\nfor they would appropriate, to no good end, the sap intended for the\r\ngraft. Nevertheless the suppression must be done cautiously. Let us not\r\nforget that what primarily causes the sap to ascend is the evaporation\r\nof moisture from the leaves. As long as the graft has not opened its\r\nbuds and spread its leaves, it is well to let the young shoots of the\r\nstock remain untouched. They act as helpers, in that their foliage\r\ndraws upward the juices extracted from the soil by the roots; so that,\r\nfar from having an injurious effect at this time, their presence is\r\nmost useful. But the day will come when the graft alone will suffice\r\nfor this work of pumping up the sap, and then it is best to get rid of\r\nthese messmates which, of heartier appetite than the graft, would soon\r\nstarve it out. First the lower shoots of the stock are suppressed, then\r\ngradually those higher up, care being taken not to destroy the top ones\r\nuntil the graft has developed shoots two or three decimeters long.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX\r\n\r\nGRAFTING\r\n\r\n(Concluded)\r\n\r\n\r\n“The part of a plant or tree above ground and the part under ground are\r\nmutually dependent, the development of one implying a corresponding\r\ndevelopment in the other. If there is a superabundance of foliage, the\r\nroots will be unable to furnish it sufficient nourishment; on the other\r\nhand, if the roots are unduly vigorous, there will be too much sap for\r\nthe foliage—an excess of nourishment which, there being no use for it,\r\nwill encumber the plant and be injurious to it. Hence if the trunk to\r\nbe grafted is strong it must have several grafts, in order that the\r\nnumber of buds to be nourished may be in right proportion to the number\r\nof nourishing roots.\r\n\r\n“To this end the trunk is cut, not obliquely as for a single graft, but\r\nhorizontally. Then it is split all the way across, following a line\r\nthat passes through the central pith, and two grafts are implanted in\r\nthe cleft, one at each end. It is evident that not more than two can be\r\nplaced in the same cleft, because the bark of the graft must of\r\nnecessity come in contact with the bark of the stock to insure\r\ninter-communication and coalescence between the sap-canals of the two.\r\nIf the size of the stock requires more than two grafts, instead of\r\nsplitting the trunk diametrically several times, it is preferable to\r\nmake lateral clefts which, leaving the center untouched, cause less\r\ndanger to the solidity of the stock.\r\n\r\n“Recourse can also be had to the following method, in which no clefts\r\nwhatever are called for, clefts being difficult to cicatrize when the\r\nwood is old. The grafts are cut like the mouthpiece of a flute; that is\r\nto say, at the base half is taken off lengthwise while the other half\r\nis left, but is whittled down, thinner and thinner toward the end, much\r\nlike a flute’s mouthpiece. Thus shaped, the grafts are inserted between\r\nthe wood and the bark of the stock, an operation facilitated by the\r\nflow of sap in the spring, when the bark separates easily from the\r\nwood. If there is danger of tearing the bark under the strain of the\r\ngraft acting as a wedge, a slight incision is made in the bark to give\r\nit the play it needs. In this way the circumference of the stock\r\nreceives the number of grafts deemed necessary. It only remains now to\r\nbind the whole securely and cover the wounds with mastic. This method\r\nis called crown-grafting, because the grafts are arranged in a crown on\r\nthe circumference of the cross-section.\r\n\r\n“Grafting by buds corresponds to that variety of slipping in which\r\nbuds, each one by itself on a small fragment of the branch, are set\r\ninto the ground. It consists in transplanting on the stock a simple bud\r\nwith the bit of bark that bears it. It is the method most commonly\r\nemployed. According to the time of year when the operation is\r\nundertaken, the graft is called an active bud or a dormant bud. In the\r\nfirst case the grafting is done in the spring, when nature is awaking\r\nfrom her winter’s sleep, so that the eye or bud implanted in the stock\r\ncoalesces with it and very soon develops into a young shoot. In the\r\nsecond instance the bud is set in place some time in July or August, at\r\nthe period of the autumnal sap, so that it lies dormant or, in other\r\nwords, remains stationary during the following autumn and winter, after\r\nuniting with the stock.\r\n\r\n“The implement here required is the grafting-knife, furnished at one\r\nend with a very sharp blade, and at the other with a short spatula of\r\nbone or very hard wood. The first thing to do is to remove the bud to\r\nbe transplanted. On a branch in which the sap is working we make with\r\nthe grafting-knife a transverse cut above the bud and another below;\r\nthen, holding the branch in one hand and the grafting-knife in the\r\nother, as the picture shows, we remove the strip of bark lying between\r\nthese two cuts and delimited laterally by the line gg´g´´ and its\r\nopposite, in figure F. This strip, which we call the shield, is shown\r\nby itself in H. The leaf that sheltered the bud in its axil has been\r\nremoved, but the base of the stem of this leaf has been left and will\r\nbe useful later for taking hold of the shield and handling it more\r\nconveniently. The shield must be cut away without any tearing and in\r\nsuch a manner that no sap-wood is left clinging to the bark. The latter\r\nmust be perfectly intact, especially in its inner layers, the seat of\r\nvital activities. Finally, the bud should have its proper complement of\r\nyoung, greenish wood, which constitutes the germ, the very heart of the\r\nbud. Should this germ be removed by unskilful manipulation, the bud\r\nwould have to be thrown away, for the graft would surely fail.\r\n\r\n“The next step is to make a double incision in the bark in the shape of\r\na T, penetrating as far as the wood but without injuring it. With the\r\nspatula of the grafting-knife the two lips of the wound are raised a\r\nlittle while the bud with its shield is taken up by the piece of\r\nleaf-stem attached to it and inserted between the bark and the wood.\r\nAll that now remains to be done is to draw the lips of the little wound\r\ntogether and bind the whole with some sort of material sufficiently\r\npliant and elastic not to compress and finally strangle the bud as it\r\ndevelops. A rush, a slender thong made of a long and flexible\r\ngrass-blade, or, better still, a piece of woolen yarn is well suited to\r\nthe purpose. But if despite all precautions the ligature should after a\r\nwhile prove too tight on account of the swelling of the graft, it would\r\nbe necessary to loosen it without delay. As soon as the graft has\r\n‘taken,’ as we say, the young shoots starting out on the stock are\r\ngradually suppressed in the cautious manner prescribed for\r\ncleft-grafting.\r\n\r\n“When the stock is too small to receive a bud in the usual manner, the\r\nfollowing expedient is resorted to. From a shoot of about the same size\r\nas the stock a rectangular strip of bark with bud attached is cut with\r\nfour incisions of the grafting-knife. This strip is immediately laid\r\nupon the stock to serve as a pattern while the point of the knife is\r\npassed all around it. In this way there is cut from the stock a strip\r\nof bark having exactly the same shape and size as the pattern, which\r\nlatter is thereupon inserted in the vacant place and made fast there by\r\na ligature. This process may not inappropriately be called veneering.\r\n\r\n“In flute-grafting the bark both above and below the bud is cut\r\ntransversely all around the stem, and then another cut is made\r\nlengthwise between these two slashes. A cylinder of bark may thus be\r\npeeled off in one piece. From the stock, which should match this\r\ncylinder in size, a similar cylinder is removed and its place taken by\r\nthe other one bearing the bud we wish to transplant.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XL\r\n\r\nROTATION OF CROPS\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are eating dinner at the farm. A large platter of pork cutlets and\r\nbeans is smoking in the center of the table. Every one has been served.\r\nIt is a pleasure to see these good people eat, they have such hearty\r\nappetites. Jacques, the big ox-driver, is the first to finish. He\r\nthrows his bone away. Azor is there to seize it. He lies flat on his\r\nstomach and takes the bone in his fore paws. Hear him bite on his hard\r\npittance. How it cracks! Let any one beware of teasing Azor now. An\r\nangry growl and a baring of his four formidable canine teeth would warn\r\nthe rash intruder to have done with his joking at once, for if\r\nnot—well, I will not be responsible for the consequences. Azor is not a\r\nsurly dog; far from it; but he is well within his rights when he brooks\r\nno nonsense at his meals. He has done his duty most valiantly as a dog.\r\nNight before last some wolves were prowling about the sheep-fold, and\r\nhe drove them off. Let Azor gnaw his bone in peace.\r\n\r\nHa, there! The big tortoise-shell cat, Master Minet, is otherwise\r\nminded. He draws near, hair erect, tail as large around as your arm, to\r\ntry to frighten Azor and rob him of his allowance. Azor, without\r\ndropping the bone, gives a low growl and lifts one paw. That is enough,\r\nthe cat flees. So, my bold Minet, what were you after here? The bone is\r\nnot for you; your teeth are not strong enough to bite it. Go away!\r\nMartha is calling you to give you some bread soaked in gravy. That will\r\nsuit you better than a bone as hard as a stone.\r\n\r\nAh, here come some more guests. The door stands open and in come the\r\nhens from the poultry-yard. Tap, tap, tap, tap; they peck the crumbs\r\nfallen from the table. Azor has no use for such diet—tiny morsels much\r\ntoo small for him; nor does the cat want them either, they are too\r\nfloury. But the hens feast on them.\r\n\r\nAnd all, human beings, dog, cat, hens, dine at the same time; only each\r\nmust make the best of what the others cannot use. Azor is content with\r\nthe bone that big Jacques threw away; the cat is satisfied with a\r\nlittle bread soaked in gravy, a dish quite inadequate to Azor’s needs;\r\nthe hens pick up the crumbs disdained by Jacques, Azor, and the cat.\r\nMartha, it seems, had prepared dinner only for the farm people, and\r\nbehold, by utilizing the scraps that are worthless to some, many others\r\njoin in the midday meal. From the scraps disdained by man the dog will\r\ngain strength to defend the flock; from those rejected by the dog the\r\ncat will acquire keen eyesight and sharp claws to see and to seize the\r\nmouse; from what is of no value to the cat the hens will make eggs; and\r\neverything, absolutely everything, will go to the profit of the farm.\r\n\r\n“Agriculture in its turn,” remarked Uncle Paul, turning to account this\r\nhomely illustration in domestic economy, “prepares dinner for the crops\r\nin its own peculiar manner. It spreads the ground with manure, that\r\nfertile dressing so relished by growing plants. The table is set, or in\r\nother words the field is ready, well plowed and harrowed, and well\r\nmanured. Whom shall we call first to the table, for it is plain we\r\ncannot invite all at once. Whom shall we call first? It shall be wheat,\r\nlet us say, a plant with tastes hard to please, but one that in return\r\ngives us bread. So wheat is sown. In this soil, full of all sorts of\r\ngood things, it cannot fail to thrive, however unfavorable the season\r\nmay be. It will select what suits it best and leave the rest.\r\n\r\n“Now that is done. The harvest is in, and it handsomely comes up to our\r\nhopes. The wheat has converted into magnificent grain the fertilizer\r\nput into the ground. Out of decay it has created nourishment. Surely it\r\nhas well acquitted itself of its charge. It has made a clean sweep: all\r\nthat could be turned into wheat it has appropriated, and there remains\r\nnothing further to be done. What would happen, then, if wheat were sown\r\nagain in the same field? Exactly the same thing that would happen to\r\nSimon if he had nothing to eat but the bone that Jacques threw away. He\r\nwould die of hunger. Simon must have man’s food, wheat must have\r\nwheat’s food. So if the first crop has exhausted the supply of material\r\nfor making wheat, how can you expect to raise a second crop? Evidently\r\nthat is asking the impossible; it is running the risk of reaping only a\r\nvery mediocre harvest or even none at all. Therefore it is the rule not\r\nto sow wheat twice in succession in the same field. And what is true of\r\nwheat is true also of all other crops. Where a plant has prospered one\r\nyear, the same plant will not do well the second year, because the\r\ningredients required by this plant are more or less exhausted. It is\r\nfoolish to invite guests to a table that is stripped bare.\r\n\r\n“If the table were spread again, if more fertilizer were added to the\r\nsoil, that would be quite a different matter, and wheat would grow as\r\nwell as it did the first time. But such a procedure would be bad\r\nmanagement, for the very utmost should be made of one meal. Before\r\nfurther expenditure in the way of fertilizer let us exhaust the virtue\r\nof the fertilizer already applied. Azor dined well on what Jacques\r\ndiscarded; the hens were well fed with what Azor and the cat left. Let\r\nus take an example from this succession of eaters who utilize each in\r\nhis own way the remnants worthless to the others. The wheat has\r\nexhausted, or nearly exhausted, all that is suitable for wheat; but\r\njust as Jacques the ox-driver left the bone, it has left in the soil a\r\ngood many ingredients that make excellent food for other crops. In\r\norder, therefore, to utilize to the last ounce the first spreading of\r\nfertilizer, we must invite to the repast a guest of different tastes.\r\nThis guest may be, for example, the potato. In soil that would have\r\nfurnished but starvation diet for wheat the potato will find quite\r\nenough to live on, its tastes not being the same as the cereal’s.\r\n\r\n“Thus we have two successive crops for one coating of manure: we have\r\nsacks of potatoes with no additional outlay in fertilizer. Is that all?\r\nNot yet. After the wheat and the potatoes there is, to be sure, but\r\nmeager nourishment left in the upper layer of the soil; but in the\r\nlower layers there remains the part of the fertilizer that the rain has\r\nwashed down and dissolved and that the short roots of the preceding\r\ncrops could not reach. To utilize this underlying matter and bring it\r\nup again to the surface in the form of forage let us now sow a plant\r\nwith vigorous roots, such as clover, sainfoin, or, still better,\r\nlucerne, which will penetrate deeper. And so we get our third crop.\r\n\r\n“After clover we can try a fourth crop, of a different kind; but it is\r\nevident that as the guests succeed one another at the same table the\r\nremnants become more and more scanty and difficult to utilize.\r\nAccordingly we must choose a hardy plant and one that is content with\r\nlittle. Finally a time will come, and at no very distant date, when the\r\nboard will be bare: the coating of manure will have given up its last\r\nparticle of nutritious matter. Then the table must be garnished afresh,\r\nthe field fertilized anew before beginning again with the same crops or\r\nattempting others. Let us demand no more. You understand, my young\r\nfriends, that in order to utilize to the utmost this precious substance\r\nthat gives us every kind of food, such as bread, vegetables, forage,\r\nmeat, fruit, dairy products—to make the very best use of this we must,\r\ninstead of raising the same crop in the same field year after year,\r\nadopt the plan of varying our crops, changing from one of one kind to\r\nanother of a different character, so that what earlier plantings have\r\nleft in the soil may be turned to account by later ones. This\r\nsuccession of different sorts of farm produce is called rotation of\r\ncrops.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI\r\n\r\nROTATION OF CROPS\r\n\r\n(Continued)\r\n\r\n\r\n“When soil is spoken of as worn out and needing rest, the speaker uses\r\na figure of speech meaning that the soil has been exhausted by the\r\ncrops it has borne. The crops do indeed take from the land a great\r\nquantity of substances necessary for plant-life; and when these\r\nsubstances are no longer present in sufficient amount, the soil refuses\r\nto produce; it is exhausted. To restore its original fertility would\r\nrequire a large outlay in fertilizer and hence it is often more\r\nadvantageous to accomplish this object by one of the following methods.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes the land is allowed to lie fallow; that is to say, it is\r\nleft to itself without any care whatever for whole years. Weeds spring\r\nup freely, and at the same time water, air, and frost act on the soil,\r\ndisintegrating and mellowing it and inducing the formation of certain\r\nsubstances necessary to vegetation. The weeds are converted into mold,\r\nand finally the land, rested and recuperated, is ready to bear a new\r\ncrop. Restoration by this process is very slow, taking several years,\r\nand hence it is customary to shorten the period of waiting by working\r\nthe soil and even manuring it, although it may not yet be the intention\r\nto sow any seed. In these circumstances the land is called fallow land.\r\n\r\n“There is, however, one way to obtain an uninterrupted succession of\r\ncrops from the same land unless the soil is very poor. All plants\r\nderive their nourishment from the soil and the atmosphere; but some\r\ntake more from the atmosphere, others from the soil. The plants that\r\nget their sustenance chiefly from the air are those that have luxuriant\r\nfoliage. The potato is one of these. You know that it is through their\r\nleaves that plants obtain the carbonic acid gas diffused in the air.\r\nThe greater the spread of foliage, the more abundant will this\r\nabsorption be. The plants that depend almost wholly on the soil are\r\nthose with only a few small, slender leaves, thus taking but little\r\ncarbonic acid gas from the air. Such is wheat.\r\n\r\n“Moreover, from the potato plant we take only the tubers, which form\r\nbut a small part of the whole, and we turn under the stalks and leaves,\r\nwhich are thereupon converted into humus. Thus the potato has the\r\nproperty of enriching the soil at the expense of the atmosphere, and it\r\ngives back more than it takes. It is, then, one of the enriching rather\r\nthan impoverishing plants in respect to its action on the soil.\r\nCereals, on the contrary, are utilized by the harvester both as to seed\r\nand haulm, nothing but the meager roots being left in the ground; and\r\nas, on account of their very scanty foliage, cereals derive almost\r\ntheir entire sustenance from the soil, they take from it much more than\r\nthey give back to it. They accordingly belong to the class of plants\r\nthat impoverish rather than enrich the soil in which they grow.\r\n\r\n“It is impossible, thus, except by a ruinous expenditure of fertilizer,\r\nto raise a crop of grain every year on the same land. But if we should\r\nlet potatoes succeed wheat, and wheat succeed potatoes, what would be\r\nthe result? The latter crop, deriving a large part of its nourishment\r\nfrom the air, would flourish in soil comparatively exhausted by wheat;\r\nand on having its leaves and stalks turned under it would give back to\r\nthe soil a part of its former fertility. Wheat could then be\r\nsuccessfully raised again on the same land.\r\n\r\n“This practice of raising successively on the same land different crops\r\nas little harmful to one another as possible and capable of utilizing\r\nto the utmost the dressing put on to the land, is nothing but that very\r\nrotation of crops that I have already told you something about. Its\r\npurpose is to economize fertilizer and at the same time to secure an\r\nuninterrupted succession of crops. The underlying principle consists in\r\nmaking an enriching plant succeed an impoverishing one; that is to say,\r\na plant with luxuriant foliage is made to succeed one with scanty\r\nfoliage. The chief enriching plants are clover, lucerne, sainfoin,\r\npotatoes, turnips, and beets. Cereals, on the contrary, are all\r\nimpoverishing plants. It is a general custom to raise on the same land\r\na more or less extended series of different crops, the series running\r\nfour, five, or six years, or even longer, after which it begins over\r\nagain in the same order. This rotation of crops is designated according\r\nto the number of years the series covers, as for instance a five-year\r\nor a six-year rotation. A six-year rotation might run, we will say,\r\nsomewhat as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n        1st year—potatoes—enriching crop.\r\n        2nd year—wheat—impoverishing crop.\r\n        3rd year—clover—enriching crop.\r\n        4th year—wheat—impoverishing crop.\r\n        5th year—sainfoin—enriching crop.\r\n        6th year—oats—impoverishing crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n“Let us examine in detail this series that we have taken as an example.\r\nThe first year the soil is thoroughly manured. One of the effects of\r\nmanuring is to start a great crop of weeds that would infest the land\r\nand impoverish the crop were they not carefully removed. Hence the\r\nnecessity of weeding. To weed a piece of ground is to destroy the weeds\r\neither by hand or with some implement. But it is not every crop that\r\nadmits of weeding: the plants must be a certain distance apart, as\r\notherwise they will be trampled under foot, cut off, or uprooted in the\r\nweeding process. Wheat cannot be weeded, its stalks are too close\r\ntogether; but potatoes are far enough apart for weeding without\r\ndifficulty. Now, weeding destroys all useless, injurious grasses and\r\nother unwelcome intruders; their future reappearance is prevented by\r\npulling them up before their seeds ripen, and thus at last the ground\r\nis cleaned and made ready for a choice crop. This will explain to you\r\nthe great advantage of letting the potato or some other crop that can\r\nbe weeded take precedence of the cereals.\r\n\r\n“The second year comes wheat. Cleaned by the tillage that has gone\r\nbefore, the ground is no longer covered with grass and weeds. Nor does\r\nit need fresh manure, for if the potatoes have consumed certain\r\nelements in the soil, these are not exactly the same that wheat\r\nrequires; and, furthermore, the dead plants, turned under and reduced\r\nto vegetable mold, compensate by what they have derived from the\r\natmosphere for what the tubers may have taken from the soil. Wheat is\r\ntherefore just the crop to raise now.\r\n\r\n“But it would be much against one’s interest to exact from the soil\r\nanother crop of wheat the third year. Exhausted by the grain it has\r\njust produced, the soil would yield but a scanty harvest unless it were\r\nfreshly manured, a process that would make of the whole operation, not\r\na piece of farming, but an example of gardening, and would also entail\r\ntoo great expense. For that reason the third year is devoted to the\r\nraising of an enriching crop, such as clover. After furnishing a supply\r\nof fodder, what is left of the clover is turned under, and all its\r\nremnants of roots, stems, and leaves are reduced to mold, which renders\r\nthe soil fit for another wheat harvest the fourth year. A third\r\nenriching crop to be turned under after the final mowing, is likewise\r\nneeded for the fifth year; and this crop may be sainfoin. At the end of\r\nthe series comes another cereal, oats, for example. The rotation is now\r\ncomplete, and the program begins all over again.\r\n\r\n“Crop-rotation is capable of innumerable variations, and the series may\r\nbe longer or shorter, but there should be the slightest possible\r\ndeparture from the rule that a cereal crop ought always to be preceded\r\nby some crop that enriches the soil.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII\r\n\r\nLAND-DRAINAGE\r\n\r\n\r\n“In the bottom of a flower-pot you will find a small round hole. Over\r\nthis hole it is customary to lay a bit of broken tile, and on this, if\r\nthe plant to occupy the pot is delicate, a few small pebbles. This\r\ndone, the pot is filled with vegetable mold. Why this hole, this bit of\r\ntile, these pebbles? That is what we are now about to consider.\r\n\r\n“Water is absolutely indispensable to plants, since it is the medium\r\nthat dissolves the various nutritive ingredients of the soil and thus\r\nrenders them capable of assimilation by the roots. Accordingly the soil\r\npenetrated by these roots must be constantly supplied with sufficient\r\nmoisture either by rainfall or by artificial irrigation. But air is not\r\nless indispensable. It disinfects the soil and by causing slow\r\ncombustion of the humus gives rise to a slight but uninterrupted\r\nliberation of carbonic acid gas, one of the nutritive substances\r\nrequired by vegetation. Should the roots be cut off from this\r\nlife-giving agency, they would languish and finally decay. Thus it is\r\nthat if vegetation is to thrive the soil in which it grows must have at\r\nthe same time both air and water. But if the bottom of the flower-pot\r\nhas no opening, or if its opening is stopped up, the water from the\r\nwatering-can will not flow through, nor will there be any air admitted\r\nfrom below, and for lack of this the roots will decay. On the other\r\nhand, if the water, after saturating the earth, runs out freely by the\r\nhole in the bottom of the pot, the damp soil will become a sort of\r\nsponge to which the air will have access from all sides, and the plant\r\nwill thrive.\r\n\r\n“This reasoning applies to the most extensive agricultural operations\r\nas well as to the care of a potted plant. After water has soaked into\r\nthe ground it should find some channel to carry it off; otherwise the\r\nroots will decay for want of air. That is why clayey soils, which\r\nretain water when they are once saturated, are unsuited to agriculture,\r\nwhile light soils, having sand mixed with the clay and thus readily\r\nallowing the water to drain off, are well adapted to it. For the same\r\nreason, again, a sandy subsoil accelerates vegetation, and a clayey\r\nsubsoil retards it. A sandy subsoil offers the same advantage as a\r\nflower-pot open at the bottom, whereas a clayey subsoil is like a\r\nflower-pot closed at the bottom. In the first case the surplus of water\r\ndrains off and the air has free access; in the second the superabundant\r\nmoisture finds no outlet and the air cannot reach the roots.\r\n\r\n“Now let us suppose we have a marshy soil to deal with. Because of the\r\nstagnant water either on the surface or a little below it nothing can\r\ngrow on this piece of ground except rushes or other hardy plants\r\ndesigned by nature for this kind of soil. Accordingly we proceed to dig\r\na number of small ditches, of a depth somewhat greater than that\r\nattained by plant-roots, and we fill the bottom of these ditches with\r\nsmall stones, on which we finally throw back the earth we have removed.\r\nThese underground ditches are suitably inclined, and all empty at the\r\nlower end into a main canal. The water saturating the soil collects in\r\nthese ditches, filters through the layer of pebbles, and empties into\r\nthe main canal, which carries it off to some river or other stream. Our\r\nmarshy soil is now like the potful of earth with a hole at the bottom,\r\nthe bit of broken tile, and layer of little pebbles: the air has free\r\naccess and brings fertility with it. This operation of ours is called\r\ndrainage, a word formed from ‘drain,’ which is both a verb and a noun.\r\nIn the latter sense we apply it to the narrow ditch dug for carrying\r\noff superfluous water.\r\n\r\n“A drainage system like that just described is the simplest possible,\r\nbut there is one serious objection to it: the layer of small stones\r\nsoon becomes clogged with soil washed down by the water, and the latter\r\ncan no longer run off. Hence it is customary to use fagots instead of\r\nstones, since they offer less obstruction. But still better results are\r\nobtained with earthenware conduits laid in the ditches. Sometimes these\r\nconduits take the form of drain-tiles such as are used on roofs, and\r\nthey rest on sills or ground-pieces of the same material; or, again,\r\nthey may be tubular in form, the successive sections loosely fitted\r\ntogether so that the water to be carried off may enter where the\r\nsections join.\r\n\r\n“The effect of drainage is not merely to carry off the superfluous\r\nwater and thus promote the aëration of the soil to the depth reached by\r\nthe roots; it also keeps the soil cool and moist by the constant\r\npresence of water in the drainage ditches or pipes. When a heap of sand\r\nis watered at its base, the moisture is seen to mount higher and higher\r\nuntil it reaches the top. In like manner the water collected in our\r\ndrainage ditches soaks into the upper soil in a dry time and thus\r\nreaches the roots of plants growing there, so that water which is\r\nsuperfluous or even harmful at certain periods is held in reserve and\r\ngradually distributed at the right moment.\r\n\r\n“Another advantage of a drainage system is that it prevents that\r\ncooling of the soil which would result from prolonged evaporation. In\r\ntaking the form of vapor water chills the objects that help to promote\r\nthe evaporation. For this reason we feel a decided chill on emerging\r\nfrom a bath; the film of moisture that covered us is passing off in\r\nvaporous form. Similarly a constant evaporation at the surface of a\r\nwater-soaked tract of land chills the ground and we have a cold soil.\r\nBut if the water is carried off by proper drainage, evaporation ceases\r\nand there is no further chilling of the surface soil. Now, a high\r\ntemperature is always favorable to vegetation.\r\n\r\n“Draining is so beneficial that it is not confined to marshy ground,\r\nwhich without it would be quite unproductive, but is applied also to\r\nordinary arable land. Wherever the soil is too clayey, or even where\r\nthe surface soil is good but the subsoil clayey, rain-water cannot\r\ndrain off readily and the ground remains soggy and cold. Eventually,\r\nhowever, it dries up, but there being no way for the air to permeate\r\nthe soil, the latter is left hard and unyielding, so that the roots are\r\nby turns drowned in liquid mud and held fast in a tenacious paste that\r\nhas been baked by the sun. Drainage overcomes these difficulties, and\r\nconsequently all rich soils that hold rain-water for some time before\r\ninfiltration are much improved by being properly drained.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII\r\n\r\nPARING AND BURNING\r\n\r\n\r\n“You see that man over there on the hillside,” said Uncle Paul,\r\npointing to a laborer who, with a large hoe, was paring the ground, so\r\nto speak, by shaving off great squares of earth covered with grass and\r\nweeds and shrubs. “You see how he stands those pieces up, either in\r\npairs, back to back, or one at a time, so bent or vaulted that they\r\nwill stay upright by themselves. Thus the air is allowed to circulate\r\nand dry them rapidly. If we come back in a few days, after sun and air\r\nhave done their work and the drying process is complete, we shall find\r\nour man there again at his work; and we shall see how he piles up the\r\nturf with the earthy side upward and outward. In the middle of the pile\r\nhe leaves a cavity which he fills with brushwood and dry leaves. Then\r\nhe sets fire to the whole. A second pile is constructed in the same\r\nmanner and likewise set on fire. Soon the entire hillside is covered\r\nwith a great number of these small furnaces, burning slowly and sending\r\nout long trails of smoke. In a few days, three or four at most, the\r\nfires burn themselves out, and then, as soon as all the piles are cold,\r\nthe mixture of ashes and calcined earth is spread over the ground with\r\na shovel. This agricultural operation is known as paring and burning,\r\nand is carried out for the purpose of rendering arable a tract of land\r\nnot yet under cultivation and still covered with wild vegetation.\r\n\r\n“The operation of paring and burning produces two effects, one with\r\nreference to the clay in the soil, the other having to do with the\r\nashes left from the burning of the weeds. Clay, as you know, is a\r\ntenacious, binding substance, impervious to both air and water.\r\nConsequently a soil that is too clayey is unfavorable for vegetation,\r\nfurnishing the roots with insufficient air and moisture. Now, when clay\r\nis heated to a high temperature, it acquires very different properties:\r\nit no longer makes paste by the addition of water, but is porous,\r\npermeable, and readily admits air and water. The paring-and-burning\r\nprocess, therefore, improves an argillaceous soil by calcining the clay\r\nand rendering it permeable. That is as much as to say that if paring\r\nand burning are beneficial to heavy or clayey soils, they are, on the\r\nother hand, harmful to those that are light or sandy.\r\n\r\n“Finally, the operation just described affects the soil through the\r\nashes of the burnt weeds. After the combustion of all vegetable matter\r\nthere remains an earthy powder or ash comprising the mineral substances\r\ncontained in that vegetable matter, substances unchanged by combustion\r\nbecause of their great resistance to heat. The most important of these\r\nis potash. All the ingredients that once belonged to the burnt plants\r\nare evidently adapted to the formation of new plants. The ashes, then,\r\nof the weeds consumed in the process of paring and burning will be very\r\nuseful to the plants about to be raised on the land that has been burnt\r\nover. By the burning, however, it is impossible to turn to account all\r\nthat the weeds contained: what escapes in the form of smoke is so much\r\nlost. Hence care should be taken not to carry combustion too far. In\r\nthis connection the calcined clay renders still another service. By\r\nbecoming porous through calcination its nature is altered so that it\r\ncan absorb and retain the gaseous products of combustion and thus save\r\njust so much waste. But if a soil lacks clay, paring and burning are\r\nharmful, and it is better simply to turn the weeds under, whereupon\r\nthey will be converted into mold instead of being dissipated in the\r\natmosphere as smoke.\r\n\r\n“Ashes other than those resulting from paring and burning are also used\r\nas an agricultural fertilizer, though they are rarely put to this use\r\njust as they are, because the contained potash, a highly valuable\r\nsubstance, is first extracted by leaching. After this process the ashes\r\nare called buck-ashes. They contain silica and also carbonate and\r\nphosphate of lime, all in a condition most favorable for assimilation\r\nby plants. Of less strength than ordinary ashes, leached ashes\r\nnevertheless produce good results, especially on clayey soil. Coal\r\nashes, too, it should be added, serve to lighten a heavy soil since\r\nthey contain a large proportion of calcined clay.\r\n\r\n“The subject of ashes leads us naturally to that of soot, a substance\r\ncomposed of vegetable matter incompletely decomposed by heat and\r\ncontaining ammonia, which renders it highly efficacious as a\r\nfertilizer. It is applied to young plants, giving them an increased\r\nvigor of growth. By its acrid quality, moreover, it is excellent as a\r\nprotection against insects that attack vegetation.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV\r\n\r\nWINE-MAKING\r\n\r\n\r\n“When wine is heated, there is first an escape of an inflammable vapor\r\nthat burns with a bluish flame. A person needs only to have seen once\r\nthis preparation of hot wine to recall that curious flame flickering\r\nover the boiling liquid and darting up little blue tongues. Now, this\r\ninflammable vapor comes from alcohol, a fluid substance that gives to\r\nwine its peculiar properties and is hence sometimes called spirits of\r\nwine. There are, then, in wine two distinct liquids, one easily\r\nreducible to vapor and called alcohol, the other slower to vaporize and\r\nrecognizable as water. This does not mean that the wine has been\r\nwatered: the water in question is not there as the result of fraud; it\r\nbelongs naturally to the wine and comes from grapes just as alcohol\r\ndoes. Wine is therefore a natural mixture of a small proportion of\r\nalcohol with a great quantity of water. In our ordinary wines the\r\nproportion of alcohol for each hundred quarts of liquid varies from\r\nnine to fourteen quarts.\r\n\r\n“Wine is made from the juice of grapes. This juice, as it is pressed\r\nout of the sweet grapes, has none of the taste or smell peculiar to\r\nwine, for it does not yet contain any alcohol; but it does have an\r\nagreeably sweet taste, the same taste that makes grapes so desirable a\r\nfruit for the table. This pleasant flavor is due to a sort of sugar\r\npresent in the grapes. Examine carefully a handful of raisins such as\r\nyou buy at the grocer’s: you will detect on their surface, certain tiny\r\nwhite grains that crunch under the teeth and have a sweet savor. Those\r\ngrains are little particles of sugar that have collected on the outside\r\nof the grapes during the process of drying. Grapes, then, must contain\r\nsugar.\r\n\r\n“Well now, this sugar is exactly what causes the formation of alcohol.\r\nWhat is sugar in the fresh juice of grapes is alcohol in the same juice\r\nafter it has fermented and turned to wine. Let us consider briefly how\r\nthis change comes about.\r\n\r\n“The vintage is first of all subjected to a process of treading by men\r\nwho trample on the grapes in large vats, after which the resulting\r\nmixture of juice and skins is left to ‘work,’ as we say. Before long\r\nthis liquid mush begins to heat of its own accord, and presently there\r\nsets in a sort of boiling which liberates big bubbles of gas as if\r\nthere were a fire underneath. This working process is called\r\nfermentation, and its seat is in the sugar of the grape-juice. Little\r\nby little the sugar decomposes, splits apart as we might say, into two\r\nsubstances very different from each other and also very different from\r\nthe sugar whence they came. Of these two substances one is alcohol; the\r\nother is a gas already known to us—carbonic acid, the same gas that\r\nplants feed on and that animals give forth in breathing; the same,\r\nfinally, as that produced by burning coal. The alcohol remains in the\r\nliquid, which thus gradually loses its original sweet taste and\r\nacquires instead a vinous flavor. The gas, on the contrary, works its\r\nway to the surface, agitating the mass with a sort of tumultuous\r\nmovement like that of boiling water, and is dissipated in the\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n“Let us bear in mind that carbonic acid gas is as invisible as the air\r\nitself, that it has no odor, no color, and finally that it kills\r\nquickly if inhaled in any considerable quantity. That explains the\r\ndanger lurking in a wine-vat during fermentation, or even in a\r\nwine-cellar that lacks sufficient ventilation to carry off the perilous\r\ngas. No one should enter such places without holding before one a\r\nlighted taper at the end of a long stick. While the taper continues to\r\nburn in the usual manner, one can proceed without fear: there is no\r\ncarbonic acid gas present. But if the flame becomes dim, gets smaller\r\nand smaller, and finally goes out altogether, one must beat a hasty\r\nretreat, for the extinction of the taper is a sure sign of the presence\r\nof carbonic acid gas, and further advance would mean exposing oneself\r\nto imminent death.\r\n\r\n“But to return to the subject of wine-making, we were saying that the\r\nsugar which imparts its sweet taste to the must (that is, the\r\nunfermented grape-juice) changes its nature and divides into two parts:\r\nalcohol, which remains in the liquid and turns it to wine, and carbonic\r\nacid gas, which is dissipated in the atmosphere. When this process is\r\nfinished the wine is drawn off, leaving behind the residuum of skins\r\nand pips. The final product is thus composed of a large quantity of\r\nwater from the grapes themselves, a small quantity of alcohol from the\r\nsugar which has undergone the chemical change just described, and,\r\nfinally, a coloring substance furnished by the dark grape-skins.\r\n\r\n“White wine is made from white grapes, which have skins with no\r\ncoloring matter; but it can very well be made from dark grapes, colored\r\nthough they are. The secret consists simply in this: the crushed grapes\r\nare pressed before fermentation begins. In this way the juice is\r\nseparated from the skins, and, these latter being removed, the wine\r\nwill be white even with dark grapes. In short, the coloring matter in\r\ngrapes which gives its hue to red wine is contained solely in the\r\nskins; and furthermore it is insoluble in water, but easily soluble in\r\nalcohol. Hence it is only after fermentation has made some progress\r\nthat the liquid becomes colored by the dissolving of the coloring\r\nmatter through the agency of the alcohol that has been generated.\r\nAccordingly, if the skins are removed before the juice ferments and\r\ngenerates alcohol, the wine remains white, since it no longer contains\r\nany coloring matter to dissolve.\r\n\r\n“Some wines force out the corks from their bottles and are covered with\r\nfoam on being poured into glasses. These are foamy wines, and to\r\nproduce them the bottling must be done before fermentation is finished.\r\nThe carbonic acid gas then continues to form, but as it finds no way of\r\nescape since the bottle is tightly corked, it dissolves in the liquid\r\nand accumulates there, though all the while endeavoring to free itself;\r\nand that is what makes the cork pop with a sharp report when the string\r\nthat holds it down is cut; that is what causes the wine to rush foaming\r\nout of the bottle; and, finally, that is what gives the bead to a glass\r\nof wine and makes a slight crackling sound as the bubbles burst on the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n“Foamy wine has a pungent but agreeable taste owing to the carbonic\r\nacid it contains. We drink, dispersed through the liquid, the same gas\r\nas would kill us if freely inhaled; but it has no terrors except when\r\nthus inhaled. Mixed with our drinks, it imparts to them a slightly tart\r\nflavor, harmless and even salubrious, since it aids digestion. There is\r\ncarbonic acid gas in nearly all water that we drink, and it is in fact\r\nby reason of this gas that water is able to hold in solution the small\r\nproportion of stony matter that contributes toward the formation of our\r\nbones. It is to this gas, finally, that effervescent lemonade, cider,\r\nbeer, and Seltzer water owe their pungency and their foam.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV\r\n\r\nTHE STAG-BEETLE\r\n\r\n\r\n“One of the joys of your time of life, I am sure,” resumed Uncle Paul,\r\nas he and his hearers seated themselves in the shade of an old oak tree\r\namid the humming and whirring of insect life all about them, “is the\r\nstudy of the little creatures of field and farm and forest, so\r\ninteresting in their mode of life, so varied in their forms and colors.\r\nYou chase the splendid butterfly from flower to flower, you take up the\r\ncockchafer and put it on a bed of fresh leaves, with a straw you drive\r\nthe cricket from its hole. The insect that amuses you can also instruct\r\nyou. In our modest studies let us now have a little talk on this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n“What is this tiny creature with the stout coat-of-mail of chestnut\r\ncolor? Its large head, showing parallel folds that might have been\r\ncarved by a sculptor’s hand, is armed with two branching nippers which\r\nopen like a pair of tongs and then close, mangling between their teeth\r\nthe finger they have seized. Woe to the giddy-pate that lets himself be\r\ncaught by them! The trap closes tighter and tighter and never lets go.\r\n\r\n“But, vigorous as are its mandibles, the insect is not one to be afraid\r\nof, provided only you look out for those nippers. For all its\r\nthreatening aspect, it is at bottom a peaceful creature. Catch it by\r\none leg and it will fly round and round like the June-bug. It is called\r\nthe stag-beetle, a name that explains itself, for it has branching\r\nmandibles resembling a stag’s horns, and it belongs to the family of\r\nbeetles. Put the two words together and you have ‘stag-beetle.’\r\n\r\n“The singular creature has not always been as we see it to-day. In its\r\nyouth, not later than last year, it had neither its present mandibles\r\nnor its six legs nor its chestnut-colored coat-of-mail. In fact, its\r\nform had nothing in common with what we now behold. Then it was a big,\r\nfat worm, with fine white skin, crawling on legs so small and feeble as\r\nhardly to deserve mention.\r\n\r\n“The whole animal consisted of little more than a crawling stomach\r\nunprovided with any protection. The head alone was fortified with a\r\nsubstantial skull of horn, and it also bore, one on the right side of\r\nthe mouth, the other on the left, two short but strong teeth adapted to\r\ncutting in pieces the wood of the oak, its sole nourishment.\r\n\r\n“Such a worm, entirely naked, evidently cannot live in the open air,\r\nwhere the thousand little roughnesses of the ground would be\r\ncontinually wounding its delicate skin. It must have a safe shelter\r\nthat it need not leave until it has become the well-armored insect we\r\nnow see. The grub of the stag-beetle does in fact live inside the oak,\r\nwhich affords it at once food and lodging. There, in the depths of the\r\ntree-trunk, is its inviolable retreat.\r\n\r\n“With its two teeth, as hard and sharp as a carpenter’s tool, it cuts\r\naway, patiently, bit by bit, the fresh wood imbued with sap. Each\r\nfragment thus detached is a mouthful for the worm’s nourishment; but as\r\nit is by no means a rich diet there must be a good deal of it to\r\nfurnish enough nutriment. Therefore the gnawing goes on without\r\ncessation, in all directions, with a corresponding enlargement of the\r\ndomicile, which soon becomes a labyrinth of galleries that go up and\r\ndown and cross one another, penetrate farther into the trunk or\r\napproach the surface, at the pleasure of the occupant, whose choice is\r\ndetermined by its taste for morsels lying in this or that direction.\r\n\r\n“For three or four years this is the worm’s mode of life. To make\r\nitself big and fat is its sole business, and to this it devotes itself\r\nwith vigor. I leave you to imagine what must become of an oak tree\r\nworked by a dozen of these gnawing creatures. Under the bark, which is\r\nalmost intact, the trunk is one vast wound, perforated with galleries\r\nthat are themselves littered with wormhole dust, and oozing with a\r\nbrown juice that smells like a tannery. Unless the forester applies a\r\nremedy, and that speedily, the enormous oak will be ruined. Leaving\r\nthis care to his charge, let us go on with our story.\r\n\r\n“When it has become big enough and fat enough, after at least three\r\nyears of continual feasting, the worm prepares to change its form. Near\r\nthe surface, that its future exit may be the easier, the little\r\ncreature hollows out a sufficiently large oval chamber and lines it\r\nwith a sort of wadding made of the finest fibers of the wood. Thus the\r\ntender flesh of the rejuvenated insect will be protected from all rude\r\nouter contact.\r\n\r\n“These precautions taken, the worm undergoes its transfiguration: it\r\nsplits open all down the back, strips off its skin, throws it away like\r\na discarded garment, and is born a second time, as one might say, but\r\nunder a totally different form. It is no longer a worm—far from it—but\r\nit is not yet a stag-beetle, although the outlines of the latter are\r\nalready discernible.\r\n\r\n“The creature is quite motionless, as if dead. The legs, neatly folded\r\nover the stomach, are as transparent as crystals; the nippers are\r\npressed close to the breast; the wings, not yet expanded, have the\r\nappearance of a short scarf encircling the flanks; and the whole is\r\nswathed in swaddling-clothes finer in texture than an onion skin. The\r\nentire organism is wrapped in a repose so profound that one might think\r\nall life extinct. It is white or crystalline in appearance, and so\r\ntender that a mere nothing will wound it. The coarse worm of the\r\nbeginning has been succeeded by this most delicate of creatures.\r\n\r\n“Out of the material amassed by the wood-gnawer’s voracious appetite\r\nthere is created an entirely new being. The flesh, at first nearly\r\nfluid, slowly acquires consistency; the skin hardens, assumes a\r\nchestnut hue, takes on the firmness of horn; in fact, when the warm\r\nseason returns again the insect wakes up from that deep sleep, not of\r\ndeath, but nevertheless very much like it. The creature moves, tears\r\napart the swathing bands under which its rebirth has taken place,\r\nstrips off these wrappings, and here at last we have the insect in its\r\nfull perfection. Behold the stag-beetle!\r\n\r\n“It comes out from its native oak, spreads its wings in flight under\r\ncover of the foliage, and settles down, now on this tree, now on that,\r\nin the rays of the sun. The freedom of the open air and the enjoyment\r\nof the light of day constitute its supreme felicity for which it has\r\nbeen preparing during the three or four years of constant toil in the\r\ndark galleries of an old oak.\r\n\r\n“Thenceforth it grows no larger. Just as it was on emerging from its\r\ncell, so it will remain to the end, without the least increase either\r\nin weight or in bulk. Thus it leads a very staid existence. In its grub\r\nstate the famished creature gnawed wood night and day; its life was a\r\nperpetual digestion. Now, on the contrary, all that it needs in the way\r\nof sustenance is an occasional sip of the sweetened sap oozing from the\r\nbark of the tree.\r\n\r\n“But its days of idle delight are numbered; it has scarcely a couple of\r\nmonths to spend joyously among the oak trees. Then it lays its eggs,\r\none by one, in the crevices of tree-trunks, to propagate its kind; and,\r\nthat done, it very soon dies. It has played its part. From those eggs\r\nwill come forth worms which will patiently work their way into the\r\nwood, hollow out galleries there in their turn, and begin all over\r\nagain the very sort of existence led by their fore-fathers.\r\n\r\n“The greater number of insects have the same life-history as the\r\nstag-beetle: they pass through different stages before taking on their\r\nfinal form. All without exception, the smallest as well as the largest,\r\ncome from eggs deposited by the mother in chosen places where the\r\nneeded nourishment, so variable in different species, is easy to find.\r\n\r\n“From the egg emerges, not the finished insect with all its distinctive\r\ntraits, but a provisional creature bearing, very often, no resemblance\r\nto the parent or to the matured offspring of that parent. This initial\r\nform we called a worm in speaking of the stag-beetle, and the name is\r\nin that instance appropriate; but in a multitude of cases it would be\r\nincorrect, having no agreement with the creature’s appearance. We then\r\ncall it a larva.\r\n\r\n“The larva is therefore the insect under the form it presents on\r\nemerging from the egg. Its continuance in this form is longer than in\r\nthat of the finally perfected creature. The larva of the stag-beetle\r\nremains a larva for three or four years, whereas the beetle itself\r\nlives but a couple of months. The sole occupation of this grub is\r\neating, continual eating, that it may grow fat and store up supplies\r\nenough to carry it through its subsequent transformations.\r\n\r\n“Having attained sufficient size, the larva constructs a retreat for\r\nitself, hollows out a little cell, and spins a cocoon where in perfect\r\nquiet the delicate task of transformation will be undertaken. It strips\r\noff its skin and becomes an inert, formative body known as a nymph.\r\n\r\n“Finally, the nymph, having arrived at the right degree of maturity,\r\ncasts off its wrappings and reveals itself as transformed into a\r\nperfect insect. It lays its eggs, and the same succession of changes is\r\nagain repeated. The egg, the larva, the nymph, the perfect insect—there\r\nyou have the four stages of the insect’s life. These changes of form\r\nare called metamorphoses.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI\r\n\r\nSHEATH-WINGED INSECTS\r\n\r\n\r\n“I show you here the scarab, clothed all in black. Passionate lover of\r\nthe sun, it rarely strays beyond the regions bordering on the\r\nMediterranean. It belongs to the band of scavengers, a group of\r\nhandsome insects which, feeding on ordure, are charged with the\r\nsanitation of the greensward defiled by grazing herds.\r\n\r\n“Its favorite dish is the dung of horses and mules. With the toothed\r\nedges of its head it rummages in the dung; with its wide, serrate fore\r\nlegs it cuts up this material, kneads it, and molds it into a ball\r\nabout as large as an apricot. This done, the next thing is to seek out\r\nsome quiet retreat far from the hubbub of its fellows who have been\r\ndrawn to the spot for as much as a kilometer round about by the odor;\r\nand of course the booty must be trundled away to this secure retreat,\r\nthere to be eaten at ease, without fear of predatory assaults from the\r\nenvious.\r\n\r\n“This task is performed in couples. One hooks on to the globule in\r\nfront and pulls with head up; the other pushes from behind with head\r\ndown. Heave ho! It starts, it rolls, under the combined efforts of the\r\ntwo partners. On the down grade the load again and again runs away with\r\nthe team, which falls headlong, gets up again, and catches hold of the\r\ncargo once more with an ardor that nothing can discourage. Under the\r\nrays of a scorching sun this store of provision is thus dragged a long\r\ndistance over the sand, across the greensward, and over ruts. Perhaps\r\nthe scarabs find their bread at first not sufficiently compact, and\r\nseek to give it consistency by rolling it on the ground. Every one\r\naccording to his fancy.\r\n\r\n“At last a favorable spot is selected in a sandy tract. One of the two\r\nproprietors hollows out in all haste a dining-room, while the other\r\nstands guard without over the globular treasure, ready to defend it\r\nstoutly against any chance marauder. As soon as the dining-room is\r\nready the provisions are stored away there, after which the two\r\ncolleagues shut themselves up in their domicile, safe from unwelcome\r\nvisitors, closing their door with sand. So there they are at table,\r\nwith their heap of victuals in front of them; and now for a good feast!\r\nWhen the board is bare again, the two banqueters leave their dugout to\r\ngather together a new globule and resume their feasting.\r\n\r\n“The scarab is not found everywhere, the more’s the pity, for its\r\nmanner of life is very curious to watch. Wanting this manufacturer of\r\nglobules, we nevertheless do have everywhere other scavengers which\r\nwork in somewhat similar fashion. Out of ordure they put together\r\nlittle balls of the size of a cherry, and sometimes they roll away\r\ntheir plunder, as does the scarab, bury it in the ground, and there\r\nregale themselves on it. Their trade of making these little balls or\r\npills has given them the expressive name of pill-mixers.\r\n\r\n“Let us pass on to other kinds. This one, for example, is called the\r\ncalosoma. By reason of the elegance of its form and the richness of its\r\ncoloring it is one of the most beautiful insects of our region. Its\r\nback has the brilliance of a gem such as no jeweler ever possessed. One\r\nwould really take it to be made of gold, but gold of a peculiar sort\r\nand much richer than ours, flashing as it does with red, green, and\r\npurple glints. There is nothing to compare with this dazzling costume.\r\nIt should be added that if the insect is taken between the fingers it\r\nemits, as a means of defense, a strong odor reminding one of a\r\nchemist’s disagreeable drugs.\r\n\r\n“The calosoma does not share the scarab’s peaceful habits: it is an\r\nardent hunter and leads a life of carnage. Its prey is the caterpillar,\r\nthe bigger the better, whether smooth-skinned or hairy. If you happen\r\nto find a calosoma, put it into a good-sized bottle and give it for\r\ndinner a lusty young caterpillar as large as your finger. You will see\r\nwith what ferocious satisfaction this drinker of blood will disembowel\r\nthe poor worm, despite all its writhing and squirming, and will feast\r\non its green entrails.\r\n\r\n“The carabid, which is also a passionate lover of game, has the\r\ncalosoma’s activity and brilliance, but is of smaller size. Some are\r\nbronze in color, others golden, still others of a copper tint, or black\r\nedged with a superb violet. All explore with keen scrutiny the thick\r\ntufts of grass, and give chase to small prey such as larvæ,\r\ncaterpillars, and worms. The most common example of this class wears a\r\ngolden green coat and is a frequenter of gardens, where it makes war on\r\nall kinds of vermin. It is the little guardian of our beds of peas and\r\nbeans, and of our flower borders. In honor of its services to the\r\ngarden we call it the gardener.\r\n\r\n“The calosoma and the carabid do not fly; they are made for running, as\r\nis evident from their long legs, their agile movements, and their lithe\r\nform. They chase the game in hot pursuit, or else lie in wait for it\r\nbehind a leaf, but never pursue it on the wing. On the other hand, the\r\nscarab, the common June-bug, and a host of other insects fly very\r\nwell.”\r\n\r\n“But why don’t they all fly?” asked Emile.\r\n\r\n“I will tell you,” replied his uncle. “Look carefully at the June-bug a\r\nmoment. It has two kinds of wings: on the outside two large and\r\nsubstantial scales of horn, and beneath these two fine membranous\r\nwings, expanded during flight, but carefully folded together and\r\nconcealed when not in use. The outside scales are called elytra, or\r\nsheaths. They serve as a case for enclosing and protecting the delicate\r\nmembranous wings, which alone are fitted for flying. The carabid and\r\nthe calosoma have sheaths of splendid brilliance, it is true, but\r\nbeneath these sheaths there are no membranous wings to spread\r\nthemselves in flight and fold up again in repose. Hence these two\r\ninsects are unable to fly.\r\n\r\n“The dytiscus and the hydrophile, whose names signify ‘diver’ and\r\n‘water-lover’ respectively, both frequent the waters of deep ponds, of\r\nditches, and of pools. With their legs flattened out like oars, their\r\nvery smooth bodies, arched above and keel-shaped below, they are\r\nfirst-rate swimmers and divers. It is a feast for the eye to follow the\r\ngraceful agility of their oars when they row calmly on the surface or\r\nplunge beneath it.\r\n\r\n“At the least alarm they dart quickly to the bed of the pond and take\r\nrefuge amid the water plants. On the instant of diving their belly is\r\nseen to flash like a plate of polished silver. The reason of this\r\nborrowed sheen is found in a thin layer of air that they carry with\r\nthem adherent to the belly. With this supply they will have air to\r\nbreathe until, all danger past, they ascend again to the surface.\r\n\r\n“In the matter of costume these two master-swimmers are of modest\r\nappearance. Both are of a very somber olive green, but in addition the\r\ndytiscus wears faded gold lace on its sheaths. If the pond dries up or\r\nceases to please them, they can quickly betake themselves to\r\nanother—not on foot, for their flattened legs, excellent as oars, are\r\nworthless in walking, but by flight, with the help of their membranous\r\nwings, ordinarily hidden under the sheaths, where the water cannot\r\nreach them.\r\n\r\n“In old oak trees the larva of the capricorn-beetle, another ravager of\r\nforests, leads much the same kind of life as does the grub of the\r\nstag-beetle. Large in size, all black with gleams of chestnut, this\r\ninsect is remarkable for its jointed horns, which are longer than its\r\nbody. What can it do with these cumbersome ornaments? Does it wear them\r\non its forehead to intimidate the foe? I would not venture to dispute\r\nthe matter, but what I do know very well is that with its extravagantly\r\nlong horns it frightens the inexperienced young pupil so that he dares\r\nnot touch it, and he calls it the devil. All the same, the\r\ncapricorn-beetle does not deserve the evil reputation it has got from\r\nthe timid. It is perfectly harmless.\r\n\r\n“Insects’ horns are called antennæ. All have them, some longer and some\r\nshorter, now of one shape, now of another. In some instances they are\r\nflexible filaments, jointed chaplets; in others, short stems ending in\r\neither a cluster of little buds or a bunch of leaves pressed one\r\nagainst the other. See for example the burly and magnificent insect\r\nthat browses the foliage of our pine-trees on warm summer days. It is\r\ncalled the pine-beetle. On a chestnut background it wears a sprinkling\r\nof white spots. The antennæ carry at the end a set of little plates or\r\nscales which open and shut like the leaves of a book.\r\n\r\n“It is in place here to mention the common June-bug, furnished like the\r\npine-beetle with antennæ bearing leaf-clusters at the end. I propose to\r\ntell you its story in detail; for, if this little creature is the joy\r\nof young people of your age, it is also the terror of the farmer.\r\n\r\n“But first one word more to conclude our short story of sheath-winged\r\ninsects. Their number is immense. Nearly all have membranous wings\r\nunder the protecting case formed by the sheaths; and these can fly.\r\nOthers, relatively few, are unprovided with membranous wings, and hence\r\nare unfitted for flight. This entire group bears the general name of\r\ncoleoptera, meaning sheath-winged. A coleopter is any insect furnished\r\nwith sheaths, whether it flies or not.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII\r\n\r\nTHE JUNE-BUG\r\n\r\n\r\n“It is a discovery of no small importance in your eyes, my young\r\nfriends, when you find the first June-bug of the season on the young\r\nfoliage. In the evening you get together in a corner and talk about it,\r\nyou make plans for the morrow, and all your conversation is about the\r\nJune-bug that has just arrived. You arrange to get up early the next\r\nday and shake the trees in order to bring down the sleeping insects;\r\nyou get ready a box, pierced with holes, to receive the captives, and\r\nput in a handful of fresh leaves for them to feed on.\r\n\r\n“At the first streak of dawn you are up; you visit the willows, the\r\npoplars, the hawthorn hedges wet with dew. It is a fruitful hunt: the\r\nJune-bugs, benumbed by the chill of night, fall like hail when you\r\nshake the branches. Soon you have a half a score of them, then a dozen,\r\nthen twenty. It is enough. You go back to the house with your prisoners\r\nfluttering and struggling in the foot of an old stocking, in your\r\nhandkerchief, or in your cap. You bring a supply of green leaves.\r\n\r\n“And now for your experiments! You tie a long string to the leg of one\r\nof the beetles and put the insect in the sun. It inflates and deflates\r\nits belly, raises its wing-sheaths, and expands its wings. There it\r\ngoes, into the air. Your experiment has succeeded. These delights of\r\nthe June-bug season, my children—enjoy them as long as you can. Other\r\npleasures pale beside them. In view of the amusement it affords you I\r\ngladly welcome the June-bug. But turn now to a less pleasing aspect of\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n“Like every other insect, the June-bug is at first a grub. In that form\r\nit lives three years in the ground, whereas in its final state, when it\r\nis found on trees and bushes, it lives but two or three weeks. This\r\ngrub or larva is commonly called the white grub, also the fish-worm,\r\nand sometimes the ground-hog. Look at it carefully for a moment and\r\ntell me what you see.”\r\n\r\n“I see,” answered Louis, “a fat, big-bellied worm, slow in its\r\nmovements, and fond of lying curled up on its side. It is of a whitish\r\ncolor with a yellowish head.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and what else?”\r\n\r\n“It has six legs, not made for running on the surface of the ground,\r\nbut for crawling underneath; and it has strong jaws for biting the\r\nroots of plants. Its head is capped with horn to help it in boring\r\nthrough the soil.”\r\n\r\n“Very good,” was Uncle Paul’s approving comment; “and you see how the\r\nstomach is distended with food, which shows in a darker tint through\r\nthe white skin of the paunch. So gorged is the worm, in fact, that it\r\ncannot stand on its legs, but lies lazily on its side.\r\n\r\n“For three years this fat grub lives under ground, always under ground,\r\ntunneling like a mole in all directions, and living on roots. Then it\r\nmakes for itself a little chamber out of earth, very smooth inside, and\r\nshuts itself up there; after which it proceeds to transform itself into\r\na nymph, and then into a June-bug. Everything serves it for food: the\r\nroots of grass and of trees, of cereals and of fodder, of vegetables\r\nand of flowers. In winter it buries itself deep in the ground and\r\nbecomes torpid; at the approach of spring it returns to the upper\r\nlayers of the soil, installs itself among the roots, and goes from\r\nplant to plant, leaving devastation in its path. You have, let us\r\nsuppose, a fine bed of lettuce in your garden. From no apparent cause,\r\nsome morning, you find it all withered. You pull up one of the plants,\r\nand it proves to have no root; the white grub has cut it away. Or you\r\nhave a nursery of young fruit trees for your orchard. The terrible worm\r\npasses that way, and your nursery is good for nothing but fire-wood. Or\r\nyou have sown several acres with wheat or rape, you have made a\r\nconsiderable outlay for fertilizer and labor; but there is promise of a\r\nhandsome harvest with large profit to you. The larva of the June-bug\r\nworks its way up from the depths, and then good-bye to your harvest;\r\nthe stalks dry up as they stand, having no roots left to sustain them.\r\nWhen this formidable worm invades a country, famine would surely follow\r\nwere it not that traffic facilities make possible the speedy\r\nimportation of provisions from other lands. We live in a progressive\r\nage and, thanks to the means of transport and to the briskness of\r\ntrade, people do not die of hunger in a province whose fields have been\r\ndevastated by the white grub. They do not die of hunger, but what woe\r\nfollows in the wake of the devouring larva! Year in and year out, it\r\ndestroys millions of francs’ worth of crops in France alone.\r\n\r\n“The multitude of these little insects is truly terrifying. When they\r\ninvade a field, the earth, undermined in all directions, loses its\r\nfirmness and yields under the pressure of the foot. One year, in the\r\ndepartment of the Sarthe, the ravages became so serious that it was\r\nnecessary to undertake a systematic destruction of the pest. The\r\nJune-bug was hunted on a large scale, and sixty thousand decaliters\r\nwere gathered in, each decaliter containing about five thousand\r\ninsects. Thus the total number taken amounted to three hundred\r\nmillions. To give you some idea of the immensity of this number I will\r\nadd that if you should try to count those three hundred million\r\ninsects, one by one, it would take you more than twenty years, working\r\nten hours a day.\r\n\r\n“In the department of the Lower Seine there was at one time found to be\r\nan average of twenty-three larvæ of the June-bug to the square meter,\r\nor two hundred and thirty thousand devourers to each hectare. A hectare\r\nwill raise a crop of one hundred thousand beets. Thus each beet was\r\ngnawed by at least two worms. Allowing eighty thousand rape-stalks to\r\nthe hectare, we find each stalk feeding three worms, or very nearly. It\r\nis clear that under these desperate conditions no rape-seed oil or\r\nbeet-root sugar can be produced. Every plant perishes. In the single\r\nyear 1866 the Lower Seine lost from this cause about twenty-five\r\nmillion francs.\r\n\r\n“In 1868, in different parts of France, notably in Normandy, the\r\nmultiplication of June-bugs was so great as to spread alarm throughout\r\nthe rural districts. Trees were completely stripped of their foliage,\r\nand in the evening, when the insects fly abroad, such clouds of them\r\nencumbered the atmosphere as to make it difficult to walk about. Almost\r\neverywhere there were June-bug hunts organized, and those who gathered\r\nthe insects received from the public treasury from four to six francs\r\nper hundred liters. In one place alone, Fontaine-Mallet, near Havre,\r\nthere were gathered four thousand and fifty-nine kilograms of the\r\ninsects in four days. The school-master sent his pupils out after\r\nJune-bugs, and four hundred and forty kilograms was the result of one\r\nday’s collecting. All these insects were carted to Havre by the\r\nwagon-load and drowned in the sea. In certain communes they were\r\nbrought to the town hall in such quantities that there was no way of\r\ndisposing of them. The air reeked with the stench they made.\r\n\r\n“It is said that in 1668 the June-bugs destroyed all the vegetation in\r\none county of Ireland, so that the country presented the dead\r\nappearance of winter. The sound made by the insects’ mandibles in\r\nbrowsing the foliage of the trees was like that of a carpenter’s saw,\r\nand the hum of wings resembled the distant beating of drums. Enveloped\r\nin clouds of insects and blinded by the living hail, the inhabitants\r\ncould hardly see to go about. The famine was horrible: the poor Irish\r\npeople were even obliged to eat the June-bugs to keep from starving.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, how awful that must have been!” exclaimed the group of listeners.\r\n\r\n“Yes, awful, indeed,” assented Uncle Paul, “and I have a few more\r\ninstances to relate, less lamentable than the Irish famine, it is true,\r\nbut still of a nature to show us how prodigious were the legions of\r\nJune-bugs in certain years. In 1832, in the neighborhood of Gisors, a\r\nstage-coach became enveloped at nightfall in a cloud of these insects.\r\nBlinded and terrified, the horses obstinately refused to go on. Finally\r\nthere was nothing to do but turn about and go back, so completely did\r\nthe humming swarm bar the way. Forty years ago the June-bugs descended\r\nupon Mâcon after ravaging the vineyards in its vicinity. They were\r\nscooped up in the streets by the shovelful, and to make one’s way\r\nthrough the cloud of beetles one had to clear a passage by the\r\nenergetic brandishing of a stick.\r\n\r\n“Since the June-bug is so redoubtable a scourge to agriculture, since\r\nit is a foe with which one must reckon most seriously, how, you will\r\nask, is it to be got rid of? There is one way, and only one: collecting\r\nand destroying both grubs and beetles. We can count to a certain extent\r\non the help of moles, hedge-hogs, ravens, crows, and magpies, all of\r\nwhich hunt the larvæ, especially in newly ploughed fields; and we can\r\nalso count on the aid of a host of birds such as shrikes, sparrows, and\r\nothers, which devour the beetles; but the number of the enemy is so\r\ngreat that this destruction by natural means does not always suffice.\r\nWe must then lend an energetic hand ourselves. Which of the two is to\r\nenjoy the fruits of the earth, man or June-bug? Man, if he will but\r\nbestir himself and wage unceasing war on both the insect and its larva.\r\n\r\n“The white grub, as I told you, bores into the earth more or less\r\ndeeply according to the season. In winter it goes down half a meter, a\r\ndepth at which it is protected from the frost. Upon the return of\r\nmilder weather it comes up again, to be within reach of the roots; and\r\nfrom the first of April it can be found by digging down twenty\r\ncentimeters. A favorable time, therefore, is chosen for turning up the\r\nearth and bringing the larvæ to the surface, whereupon women and\r\nchildren, following after the plough, gather up the white grubs in the\r\nfurrows. A single hectare has been known to yield in this way from two\r\nhundred to three hundred kilograms of worms. The vermin are pressed\r\ndown into the earth with lime, the whole making an excellent manure,\r\nand the enemy of harvests thus serves to accelerate their growth.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII\r\n\r\nCATERPILLARS AND BUTTERFLIES\r\n\r\n\r\n“Of all insects butterflies are the most graceful, the most worthy of\r\nchildhood’s eager desire. Oh, how beautiful they are! Poised on a\r\nflower, they seem to form a part of it and to animate it with the\r\ngentle beating of their wings. You cautiously draw near, you crouch\r\ndown and make a quick clutch with the hand, but the beautiful creature\r\nis no longer there. It is waiting for you on another flower, quite\r\nunconcerned at your designs on its freedom. Let us leave it, then, to\r\nflit from one cluster of lilacs to another, and occupy ourselves a\r\nwhile with an account of its structure and habits.\r\n\r\n“All butterflies have four wings suitable for flying, two upper and\r\nlarger ones, and two lower ones half hidden under the others. Here we\r\nfind no horny sheaths such as are worn by the scarab and the June-bug,\r\nno protecting case under which the membranous wings are folded to guard\r\nagainst laceration. The scarab is a clod-hopper, well acquainted with\r\nthe harsh irregularities of the ground. He pursues his plodding course\r\non foot, and it is only rarely that he spreads his wings in flight. The\r\nbutterfly is a delicate creature of the air, very seldom using its legs\r\nfor walking, but finding them of service when it alights upon a flower.\r\nIt has, therefore, four broad wings, wide-spread and always ready for\r\nflight.\r\n\r\n“And what wings! Words are lacking to describe them fitly. Some are\r\nwhite as if coated with flour, others sky-blue, and still others\r\nsulphur-yellow. Again you find them of a flame-like red or dark\r\ncrimson. Some have round spots like eyes, which look at you with their\r\nlarge pupils encircled by azure, mother-of-pearl, or gold; and you will\r\nsee others speckled with black, adorned with silver lace, or fringed\r\nwith carmine. If you touch them they leave on your fingers a brilliant\r\npowder beside which the filings of the precious metals would look dull.\r\n\r\n“This dust might be called the butterfly’s plumage. It consists of\r\nscales of extreme delicacy, placed regularly side by side like the\r\ntiles on a roof, and attached by one end to the membrane of the wing\r\njust as a bird’s feathers have their quills implanted in its skin.\r\nGrasped roughly between the fingers, the wing parts with its delicate\r\ncovering; it loses its ornamental scales and shows naked to the view.\r\nIt is then a fine, translucent membrane traversed by a network of tiny\r\nribs, or nervures, as they are called, which hold it expanded and give\r\nit firmness.\r\n\r\n“At rest, butterflies do not all carry their wings in the same manner.\r\nThose that fly by day and go from flower to flower in full sunlight,\r\nhold their wings erect on the back and folded against each other. These\r\nbutterflies are also recognized by their brilliant coloring, their\r\nlightness on the wing, their grace of form. Those, [6] on the other\r\nhand, that fly either by night or at evening twilight bear their wings,\r\nin repose, either outspread or else lightly folded in a sort of\r\nroof-shape. They are of bulkier form and heavier than the\r\nfirst-mentioned, and sombre hues predominate in their costume.\r\n\r\n“Whether friends of light or fond of darkness, whether courting the\r\nsunshine or lovers of the night, butterflies are invariably very\r\nabstemious, finding all the nourishment they require in the tiny drop\r\nof honey exuding at the bottom of a flower. Many flowers have long and\r\nnarrow mouths; no insect muzzle is slender enough to reach into flasks\r\nlike these and lap up the syrup, and therefore butterflies must have a\r\nspecial instrument adapted to the purpose.\r\n\r\n“This instrument is the proboscis, as fine as a hair and long enough to\r\nreach to the exquisite drop, however deeply it may be hidden. When not\r\nin use, this proboscis is kept tightly coiled at the entrance to the\r\ninsect’s mouth. When it finds a flower to its taste, it uncoils this\r\nspiral and extends the proboscis in a long thread which plunges into\r\nthe narrow-necked bottle and proceeds to suck up the coveted drop. If\r\nwe wished to drink from a flask of similar shape, we should use a straw\r\nor reed. Its proboscis is the butterfly’s straw with which it takes its\r\nrefreshment from the flowers.\r\n\r\n“As with other insects, the butterfly is at first a larva or worm, very\r\ndifferent, you understand, from what the creature will afterward\r\nbecome. The larvæ of butterflies are nothing in the world but\r\ncaterpillars.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, how disgusting!” cried Emile, making a wry face.\r\n\r\n“But nevertheless so it is,” proceeded his uncle. “Caterpillars,\r\nrepugnant creatures to us, change into those magnificent butterflies\r\nthat we are never tired of admiring. What was ugly becomes beautiful,\r\nwhat was frightful finds itself the proud possessor of grace and charm.\r\n\r\n“There are some caterpillars that have the skin quite naked and mottled\r\nwith various colors in a manner not unpleasing to the eye. To touch\r\nthese worms, even to handle them, inspires little or no fear, so\r\nharmless do they look. But there are others, of a larger size, which\r\ncarry on the back, toward the rear, a menacing horn, a sort of hook, of\r\nwhich it seems prudent to beware. This apprehension, however, is\r\ngroundless: the horn is inoffensive, being not a weapon but a mere\r\nornament. Caterpillars thus equipped become large butterflies flying in\r\nthe late evening twilight.\r\n\r\n“Still others have an even more repulsive look, bristling as they do\r\nwith clusters of prickles and with tufts of long hair. From these ugly\r\ncreatures, whose very touch would be so disagreeable to us and would\r\nmake us utter cries of fear, come some of the most beautiful\r\nbutterflies of our part of the world. Such is the caterpillar that\r\nbrowses the leaves of the nettle and becomes the Vanessa Io or\r\npeacock-butterfly. It is black with white spots, and wears a rough\r\narmor of toothed prickles. The butterfly, the Vanessa, has wings of a\r\nbright brick-red adorned with a large eye of mingled black, violet, and\r\nblue. Who would ever imagine, unless he had seen the transformation or\r\nheard about it, that so ravishing a creature has such an origin?\r\n\r\n“But for all their hairs and prickles caterpillars need cause us no\r\nalarm. Nothing about them justifies the fear they too often inspire. No\r\ncaterpillar is poisonous, no caterpillar seriously injures the hands\r\nthat touch it. Yet it is well not to repose full confidence in hairy\r\ncaterpillars: sometimes the hairs become detached and cling to the\r\nfingers, causing rather lively itching sensations. But a little\r\nscratching ordinarily ends the trouble. Accordingly any one who should\r\nhereafter be afraid of caterpillars would not deserve the privilege of\r\nchasing butterflies.\r\n\r\n“Every larva is a gluttonous eater, because it must grow big and\r\naccumulate the wherewithal for its subsequent changes of form. Nor are\r\ncaterpillars lacking in response to this serious duty. The future\r\nbutterfly’s welfare is at stake. Made solely for eating, the larvæ gnaw\r\nand browse unceasingly. Each one has its own particular kind of\r\nsustenance, its chosen plant, and nothing else meets the requirements.\r\nThe larva of the Vanessa selects the nettle and turns with aversion\r\nfrom all substitutes; that of the Pieris, a white butterfly with black\r\nspots, will have only the cabbage; that of the Machaon, a butterfly\r\nwith large wings that end in a sort of tail, feasts on fennel; and so\r\nof others.\r\n\r\n“After attaining the full size assigned to them by nature,\r\ncaterpillars, like other larvæ, prepare for their transformation. Some\r\nshut themselves up in a cocoon made from a silken thread that they spin\r\nfrom their mouth, while others content themselves with binding\r\ntogether, by means of the small supply of thread at their disposal,\r\nparticles of earth, bits of wood, and hairs plucked from their own\r\nbody. Thus is obtained, at small expense, a sufficiently substantial\r\ntemporary abode. Finally, still others, especially among the\r\nbutterflies that fly in the daytime, merely seek a retreat on the side\r\nof some wall or against a tree-trunk, and there suspend themselves in a\r\ngirdle of silk.\r\n\r\n“These precautions taken, the caterpillar strips off its skin and\r\nbecomes a nymph, but very different from that which the stag-beetle\r\nshowed us. The coleopter, in its nymph stage, was already recognizable,\r\nwith its branching mandibles, its legs folded on its stomach, and its\r\nwings enclosed in their sheaths. The butterfly, on the contrary, is not\r\nat all discernible under the casing of the nymph. This nymph, with skin\r\nas tough as parchment, is an object little indicative of its true\r\nnature and much more suggestive of the kernel of some strange fruit\r\nthan of any animal form. Because of its shape, so different from that\r\nshown to us by ordinary nymphs, it has received a special name, that of\r\nchrysalis.\r\n\r\n“This word means golden sheath. Sometimes, notably in the case of the\r\nVanessa, the chrysalis is adorned with gilding; but in the great\r\nmajority of instances the suggestive name is not deserved, a uniform\r\nchestnut hue, darker or lighter, being the usual color of the\r\nchrysalis. Ripened by long repose, this species of animal shell splits\r\ndown the back and releases the perfect insect, complete in all its\r\nattributes. The butterfly passes a few festive days amid the flowers,\r\nand before dying lays eggs whence will spring caterpillars to continue\r\nthe race.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX\r\n\r\nANTS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Ants live in communities, each containing many members, in underground\r\nabodes, where the young are reared. These communities are composed of\r\nthree kinds of insects: males and females, recognizable by their large\r\ntransparent wings, four to each ant; and the neuters, or workers, which\r\nhave no wings. These last, the workers, build the house, take care of\r\nthe community, rear the larvæ and bring them their food, distributing\r\nit to each one. The others do not work. To add to the population by\r\nfurnishing an abundant supply of eggs is all that they are expected to\r\ndo.\r\n\r\n“As soon as the rays of the morning sun strike the ant-hill, the\r\nworkers standing watch at the entrance hasten within, nudge their\r\ncomrades with their antennæ to wake them up, run from one to another,\r\nurge them on, hustle them into activity, and put all the subterranean\r\ngalleries into lively commotion. First of all, attention must be given\r\nto the larvæ, feeble transparent worms, without feet and unable to feed\r\nthemselves and to grow unless they receive assiduous care from their\r\nnurses.\r\n\r\n“Accordingly, aroused by the tumult caused by the workers rushing in\r\nfrom outside, the ants proceed to busy themselves with the larvæ and\r\nalso with the nymphs, carrying them with all possible expedition into\r\nthe open air and placing them where they will best be exposed for some\r\ntime to the benign influence of the sun’s heat. After this sun-bath\r\nthey are returned to the darkness and stowed away in chambers expressly\r\nprepared for them. And now is the time for feeding the nurslings.\r\n\r\n“Just as little birds receive the beakful of food, so do the larvæ take\r\ntheir nourishment. When they are hungry they raise themselves a little\r\nand seek the mouth of some one of the workers engaged in ministering to\r\nthem. The nursing ant opens its mandibles and lets a tiny drop of\r\nsweetened liquid be taken from its mouth. Thus, one suck at a time, the\r\nnutritive juice is distributed until the entire brood is fed.\r\n\r\n“But carrying the larvæ into the sun and feeding them will not suffice:\r\nthey must also be kept in a state of extreme cleanliness. The workers\r\nbestow upon their charges the same tender care that the mother cat\r\nexercises toward her kittens. Over and over again they lick the\r\nnursling’s body to give it perfect whiteness, and they tug cautiously\r\nat the wrinkled skin when the transformation draws near.\r\n\r\n“Before casting this skin the larva spins itself a cocoon of silk,\r\nelongated and cylindrical in shape, pale yellow in color, very smooth,\r\nand compact in texture. Under cover of this protecting sac, the worm\r\nbecomes a nymph. In this form the ant assumes its final shape, lacking\r\nonly strength and a little firmness. All its members are distinct, but\r\nenveloped in a fine membrane which it must strip off to become a\r\nperfect insect.\r\n\r\n“If you disturb an ant-hill you will see the workers hastening to carry\r\naway and put in a safe place certain cylindrical bodies having somewhat\r\nthe appearance of grains of wheat and very inappropriately called\r\nant-eggs. They are not the eggs of the insect, which are in reality\r\nmuch smaller; they are cocoons with their contents, larvæ at first,\r\nnymphs later.\r\n\r\n“When the time comes for leaving its cocoon, the enclosed ant is unable\r\nof itself to gain its freedom by piercing with its mandibles the silken\r\nenvelope; it possesses nothing resembling the solvent liquid which the\r\nsilk-worm holds in reserve in its stomach; nor has it at the forward\r\nend of its prison-cell a door for exit analogous to the curious paling\r\nprovided for the great peacock-butterfly. It would perish in its silk\r\nsack if the working ants did not bestir themselves for its deliverance.\r\n\r\n“Three or four of these mount the cocoon and strive to open it at the\r\nend corresponding to the prisoner’s head. They begin by weakening the\r\ntexture of the sac by tearing away a few threads of silk at the point\r\nwhere the opening is to be made; then, nipping and twisting the tissue\r\nso difficult to break through, they at last succeed in puncturing it\r\nwith a number of holes near one another, whereupon the mandibles are\r\napplied at one of these holes just as one would apply a pair of\r\nscissors, and a narrow strip is cut away. At this hard labor the ants\r\nwork in relays, toiling and resting by turn. One holds the narrow strip\r\nthat has been cut, while a second enlarges the opening, and a third\r\ngently extricates the young ant from its natal sac.\r\n\r\n“At last the insect comes forth, but unable to walk or even to stand on\r\nits legs, for it is still enswathed in a final membrane which it cannot\r\nstrip off unaided. The workers do not forsake it in this new\r\npredicament; they free it from the satin envelope enwrapping all its\r\nmembers; with delicate care they extricate the antennæ from their\r\nsheaths; they disengage the feet and set the body at liberty. Then the\r\nyoung ant is in a condition to walk about and, above all, to take\r\nnourishment, which it greatly needs after all this fatiguing exertion.\r\nIts liberators vie with one another in offering the mouth and\r\ndisgorging a little sweetened liquid. For some days longer the workers\r\nkeep a watchful eye on their new companions and follow them about,\r\nacquainting them with the labyrinthine passages of their abode. Thus\r\ninstructed, the young ants mingle with the others and share their\r\nlabors.\r\n\r\n“The nurses remaining at home to perform the household duties depend\r\nfor their rations on the workers that go out to collect supplies. These\r\nlatter bring them little insects, or pieces of those that they have\r\ndismembered on the spot when the entire prey is too large for\r\nconveyance. Whatever they may be, these provisions are passed around\r\nand are speedily disposed of by the assembled company. If the working\r\nants chance to find ripe fruit or large pieces of game that cannot be\r\ndivided into small parts, they adopt another mode of procedure. Placed\r\nin possession of so great riches, they content themselves with the\r\njuice alone, of which they imbibe copiously, then return home with\r\nstomachs full of liquid food which they disgorge, drop by drop, as fast\r\nas their hungry comrades present themselves.\r\n\r\n“The ant in need of nourishment strikes rapidly with its antennæ those\r\nof the ant expected to render the desired assistance. Presently they\r\nare seen to approach each other with open mouths and tongues out in\r\nreadiness for the transfer of the nutritive liquor from one to the\r\nother. During this operation the ant receiving the mouthful of\r\nsustenance keeps up an uninterrupted caressing, with fore legs and\r\nantennæ, of the ant ministering to its needs.\r\n\r\n“Who is not familiar with the lice that infest plants, assembled in\r\ndense groups that contain each more members than one could easily\r\ncount? There are black lice on the beanstalks, green ones on the\r\nrosebushes, their stomachs carrying, behind, two little tubes whence\r\noozes from time to time a tiny drop of liquid. This liquid is the ant’s\r\nmain dependence for food. Let us follow an ant on its rounds among the\r\nplant-lice.\r\n\r\n“It goes hither and thither among the motionless herd, which is nowise\r\ndisturbed by its presence. Having found what it is after, the ant\r\nstations itself close to one of the lice, which it proceeds to caress\r\nwith gentle taps of its antennæ on the little creature’s stomach, first\r\non one side, then on the other. The milch-louse allows itself to be\r\nseduced by these friendly overtures, and a drop of liquid oozes out at\r\nthe end of the tubes, the ant sucking it up at once. A second louse is\r\nvisited, and it too is solicited in the same caressing fashion. It\r\nyields its drop of liquid and lets itself be milked, after which the\r\nant passes without delay to a third louse, which it coaxes in like\r\nmanner. A fourth, probably already drained, withstands the wheedling,\r\nwhereupon the ant, perceiving that nothing is to be hoped for there,\r\nproceeds to a fifth member of the herd and obtains what it desires. A\r\nfew of these mouthfuls are enough to satisfy an ant, and then it\r\nreturns to its home.\r\n\r\n“Certain ants are great stay-at-homes: for them it would be a painful\r\ninfliction to have to go out into the world. In order to spare\r\nthemselves this necessity they raise plant-lice and pasture them in\r\nenclosures very near the ant-hill so that the milking may be done at\r\nleisure. These herded plant-lice are their precious possession, and the\r\ncommunity is more or less rich as it owns more or less of this\r\nproperty. It constitutes the ants’ flocks and herds, their cows and\r\ngoats. They build underground stables among the grass-roots, and there\r\nkeep the plant-lice which they obtain from a distance, just as we\r\ngather our domestic animals under the roof of barn or fold.\r\n\r\n“Others display an even more curious ingenuity: they take possession of\r\nthe lice living on some branch or twig of a growing bush, and,\r\njealously watchful of their cattle, suffer no stranger to come and lay\r\nclaim to the food-supply they themselves are preparing to appropriate.\r\nWith their mandibles they drive off all intruders; they patrol the twig\r\nin vigilant defense and stand careful guard over their herds. If the\r\ndanger becomes too menacing, they hasten to carry away their livestock\r\nand pasture it elsewhere, in a safe place.\r\n\r\n“Or, as still another device, they take little pellets of earth and\r\nbuild around the twig a sort of pavilion, a structure with a very\r\nnarrow opening, a sheep-fold, in a word, with a few leaves growing\r\ninside it and furnishing sustenance to the enclosed flock. In this\r\nquiet retreat the proprietors milk their ewes, safely sheltered from\r\nrain and sun and, most important of all, from alien ants.\r\n\r\n“We have in this region a rather large reddish ant known as the red ant\r\nor Amazon ant, which cannot without help build its house, raise its\r\nlarvæ, procure food, or even eat food; but with its hooked mandibles it\r\nis admirably equipped for fighting and pillage. Slaves are the object\r\nof its predatory raids, slaves to feed it, to go out after provisions,\r\nto build the ant-hill, and to rear the young. A small black or drab ant\r\nis the object of its slave-hunting excursions.\r\n\r\n“In battalions of some thousands each the reds go forth in quest of a\r\nnest of drabs. They break into the ant-hill notwithstanding its\r\noccupants’ resistance, and sack the underground city. Presently they\r\ntake their departure, each with his plunder between his mandibles. They\r\ncarry away, not the full-grown ants, since these could not be trained\r\nto serve in the strange ant-hill and would speedily make their way back\r\nto their former home, but the young ones, and the nymphs shut up in\r\ntheir cocoons.\r\n\r\n“Hatched in the domicile of the reds, the ants issuing from the stolen\r\ncocoons look upon the natal ant-hill as their own and there fulfill\r\ntheir customary duties with diligence. They go out after provender,\r\nundertake all building operations, care for the larvæ of the Amazon\r\nants, and feed their big and stupid conquerors who, once in possession\r\nof enough slaves, never leave home again.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER L\r\n\r\nTHE ANT-LION\r\n\r\n\r\n“On the margin of ponds and streams we may see, flying from one bulrush\r\nto another, certain insects with large transparent wings and abdomen\r\nlong and slender like a piece of string. Some are of a bronze green\r\ncolor, others of a splendid indigo blue, while still others, somewhat\r\nlarger, are clothed in mingled black and yellow. They are called\r\nlibellulids or, more commonly, dragon-flies, and also devil’s\r\ndarning-needles.\r\n\r\n“Do you recognize the insect? Haven’t you ever run after it? Perched on\r\na reed that trembles in the current, it seems to be dozing and waiting\r\nfor you, its wings extended to the utmost. Your hand darts out to seize\r\nit. Good-bye, darning-needle! It is ten paces away from you.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed,” replied Louis, “every one has chased darning-needles,\r\nbut I never knew of any one’s catching them. And we don’t have to go so\r\nfar as the brook or the mill-pond to find them, either.”\r\n\r\n“No; not all of them are lovers of water. Some, in fact, avoid it and\r\nprefer sandy places parched by the burning sun. A modest gray is their\r\nuniform, but they make up for their lack of brilliancy by their curious\r\nmode of life while they are still in the larva form. The picture that I\r\nshow you here illustrates what these gray dragon-flies look like at an\r\nearlier stage.\r\n\r\n“A singular creature and not exactly ingratiating in appearance. It\r\nwould not be very pleasant to encounter one in a lonely nook in the\r\nwoods, little adapted though its size is for attacking us. Look at its\r\nferocious pointed nippers, opening and closing like a pair of tweezers.\r\nDo they not betoken a thirst for blood? As a matter of fact, the little\r\ncreature lives by carnage exclusively; it is a hunter whose game is the\r\nant. Hence its name of ant-lion, or, as it might be put, the lion of\r\nthe ants.\r\n\r\n“Prey of that sort is incapable of serious resistance when once it has\r\nbeen seized by those terrible hooks; but it must first be seized, and\r\nthere is the difficulty. The nimble ant scampers off at the first\r\napproach of danger, and if it should chance to be hard pressed it has\r\nonly to run up a blade of grass and there be out of reach. The\r\nant-lion, on its part, heavy of paunch and short of leg, drags itself\r\nalong very awkwardly; and, moreover, if it ever undertakes to get over\r\nthe ground—a rare occurrence—it always moves backward, which is not\r\nwhat might be called a speedy gait and does not adapt itself to keeping\r\nthe object of one’s pursuit always in sight.\r\n\r\n“The chase being thus rendered impracticable, there remain the snare\r\nand the ambuscade. The creature must capture by cunning what its\r\nsluggishness of movement makes it impossible to get possession of\r\notherwise. Let us see what form this cunning takes.\r\n\r\n“Hunt at the base of sun-exposed walls and rocks, and if you find there\r\nsome little nook with very fine and dry sandy soil, the ant-lion will\r\nseldom fail to be there too. Its abode is easily recognized by the\r\nregular funnel-shaped hollow scooped in the ground. The insect itself\r\nis invisible, being hidden under the sand at the bottom of the\r\nexcavation.\r\n\r\n“With the blade of a knife thrust obliquely into the ground lift up the\r\nbottom of the funnel, and you will have the little creature, rather\r\nabashed at first by the sudden destruction of its retreat, but soon\r\nrecovered and striving to hide itself in the soil by a backward\r\nmovement. Make haste to take it and put it into a glass under a layer\r\nof fine sand like that beneath which you found it. There at your\r\nleisure you can watch it as it hollows out its funnel, a pitfall for\r\ncatching ants. You will see it put into practice the cunning wiles of\r\nan ambushed hunter.\r\n\r\n“Let us for a moment stand as onlookers, mentally at least, while this\r\nwork goes forward. Placed on a bed of sand and restored from its former\r\ndismay, the ant-lion proceeds to plunge its belly halfway into the\r\nsoil; then, with this substitute for a plowshare, and always moving\r\nbackward, it draws a circular furrow. Returning to its starting-point\r\nit draws a second furrow close to the first, then a third next to the\r\nsecond, and so on with a great many more, each one of smaller\r\ncircumference than the preceding, so that they all together form a\r\nspiral which constantly approaches the center; and as this living plow\r\nis driven deeper and deeper at each circuit, and throws outward the\r\nsoil that it turns up, the final result is a funnel of about two inches\r\nin diameter and somewhat less in depth. There you have the ant-lion’s\r\ntrap, the treacherous pitfall in which the ants are caught.\r\n\r\n“Of course the huntsman employing such a device as this must himself\r\nkeep well out of sight. The ant-lion is too well versed in its art to\r\nviolate this elementary principle. It crouches down under the sand at\r\nthe lowest point of the upturned funnel, with only its nippers showing,\r\nand these are pressed close to the ground, but wide open and ready to\r\nseize any luckless ant that may chance to tumble down the incline.\r\nAlthough the horrible pincers are exposed, they are not likely to\r\nexcite suspicion, being easily mistakable from the edge of the\r\nexcavation for some stray bits of dead leaves.\r\n\r\n“These preparations completed, the insect lies in wait, perfectly\r\nmotionless. Its patience and its hunger are subjected to prolonged\r\ntrial. Hours and even days pass with no sign of game. Alas, how\r\ndifficult it is in this world even for an ant-lion to win its mouthful\r\nof bread!\r\n\r\n“But at last there comes an ant, on business bent that takes it into\r\nthese parts. Preoccupied with its own concerns, it takes no heed of the\r\npitfall. Hardly has it approached the edge of the chasm when the sand,\r\nwhich is extremely unstable, gives way under the little creature’s\r\nfeet. There is a land-slide, and with it down tumbles the incautious\r\nant. In mid-course it succeeds by desperate efforts in arresting its\r\ndescent. It struggles to regain the upper level; its tiny claws,\r\ntrembling with fear, catch as best they may at the roughness of the\r\nslope; but as soon as touched these supports yield, and the down-rush\r\nbegins anew with irresistible impetus.\r\n\r\n“One grain of sand, more firmly planted than the rest, offers some\r\nresistance. Perhaps safety will be found in this point of support if it\r\ncontinues to withstand the strain. It holds firm, surely enough. The\r\nant climbs up a little, heedful of its steps for fear of precipitating\r\nanother slide. It has almost gained the edge of the excavation and\r\nseems about to find its feet once more on firm ground. Will it indeed\r\nescape scot-free?\r\n\r\n“Oh, no. The hungry watcher at the bottom of the funnel will have\r\nsomething to say on that subject. He intends to make a good dinner on\r\nthe ant. If things had followed their customary course and the\r\nimprudent victim, caught in the trap, had continued to slide down until\r\nwithin reach of the nippers, these would have seized their prey without\r\nfurther formality; but since the game seems about to escape, it is the\r\nhuntsman’s part to employ the manœuvres reserved for difficult cases.\r\n\r\n“The ant-lion’s head is flat and somewhat shovel-shaped. The insect\r\nplunges it into the sand and then, with a sudden movement of the neck,\r\nthrows the shovelful up into the air so that it will come down again on\r\nthe ant. Other shovelfuls follow in quick succession, better and better\r\ndirected, and fall back in a hail-storm on the now nearly exhausted\r\nant.\r\n\r\n“Against this shower of sand resistance is impossible when one stands\r\non a treacherous footing that gives way at each attempt to escape. The\r\npoor victim is swept away and rolls to the bottom of the funnel.\r\nInstantly the nippers seize their prey, and all is over. The huntsman\r\ngoes to his dinner, not gnawing the fruit of his patient skill, since\r\nit is too tough for that, but sucking the juice like the refined\r\nepicure he is.\r\n\r\n“When there is nothing left of the ant but a dry husk, the ant-lion\r\nloads it on to his head and with an upward toss throws it out of the\r\nfunnel, in order not to defile his place of ambush with a useless\r\ncorpse which might arouse the distrust of passers-by. Then a little\r\ncareful mending restores the pitfall to its former mobility, and the\r\nhuntsman waits patiently for another ant to take a false step and slide\r\ndown into his lair.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI\r\n\r\nVENOMOUS ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Among venomous animals there are some whose poisoned weapon has no\r\nother purpose than to serve as a means of defense. Such is the bee, the\r\nworker in honey of our hives; such also is the burly, hairy bumblebee,\r\nwhich also gathers a store of honey, but keeps it underground in rude\r\nlittle pots of wax. Let us not molest them at their task, either\r\nintentionally or otherwise, and they will not molest us. If we irritate\r\nthem, they straightway draw on the aggressor and stab him with their\r\nvenomous dagger. This weapon they carry for defense, not for attack.\r\n\r\n“But there are other and more redoubtable creatures that use their\r\nvenom for killing quickly, and without any dangerous struggle on the\r\nvictim’s part, the prey on which they feed. Of course the offensive\r\nweapon is capable of becoming also a defensive one in moments of peril:\r\nthat which serves to kill the prey serves likewise to repel the enemy.\r\nAmong animals making this double use of their venomous weapon, first\r\nfor attack and then for defense, let us note the scorpion and the\r\nviper.\r\n\r\n“The scorpion is a hideous creature and of interest to us solely on\r\naccount of its sting. It has a flattened stomach, dragging on the\r\nground, and no distinct head. In reality it has a head, but so little\r\ndifferentiated from the rest of its body as to give a truncated\r\nappearance to the whole. On each side are four feeble legs, and in\r\nfront a big pair of nippers like those of the crab. Behind is a sort of\r\njointed tail, the terminal joint of which, more swollen than the\r\nothers, serves as reservoir for the venom. It ends in a hook, very\r\nsharp and with a microscopic perforation at the point, from which the\r\nvenomous fluid escapes at the instant of attack.\r\n\r\n“In this jointed tail with its terminal sting you behold the scorpion’s\r\nimplement of the chase, a terrible weapon which kills immediately, at\r\none stroke, any small game the animal may have seized. It is carried\r\nbent over on the back, ready to inflict its deadly wound in front or\r\nbehind with the suddenness of a released spring. The two-jawed nippers,\r\nof which only one jaw moves, are harmless despite their menacing\r\nappearance. They are a sort of tongs used by the animal to hold within\r\nreach and prevent from escaping the prey it is about to sting.\r\n\r\n“The scorpion is carnivorous, feeding on all game adapted to its size,\r\nsuch as wood-lice, insects, spiders. Endowed with but little agility,\r\nit leaves its lair by night and under cover of the darkness hunts its\r\nsleeping prey. Let us suppose it to chance upon a big spider. That is\r\nindeed a succulent morsel, but its capture involves danger, for the\r\nspider on its side is armed with two venomous fangs in its mouth. Being\r\nboth thus equipped with deadly weapons, which of the two will succumb?\r\nIt will be the spider.\r\n\r\n“The scorpion seizes it with its two nippers and holds the victim far\r\nenough away to avoid the risk of a bite. Then the coiled tail quickly\r\nstraightens out over the scorpion and proceeds to inflict a sting on\r\nthe helpless captive. It is all over. The stricken prey gives a\r\nmomentary shudder in its death agony and then collapses, lifeless. The\r\nhuntsman can now feast on his victim at leisure and in perfect\r\nsecurity.\r\n\r\n“We have in France, in the southern departments, two species of\r\nscorpions, of which the smaller and more common is of a greenish black.\r\nIts customary haunt is under the stones at the base of old walls, the\r\nfavorite lurking-place of the wood-louse and the spider; but it also\r\nvery often finds its way into human habitations, where it hides in dark\r\ncorners. In rainy weather it snuggles under the linen laid away in\r\ncupboards, and even creeps under the bedclothes. Not a pleasant\r\nexperience is it to find this baneful intruder, some fine morning, in\r\nthe foot of one’s stocking. One shakes out the frightful creature and\r\ntreads it under foot. If it has stung you, the pain is no joke, though\r\nnot seriously dangerous.\r\n\r\n“The other species, much larger and far more to be dreaded, is found\r\nalmost exclusively in Languedoc and Provence. It is straw-color in hue\r\nand inhabits sandy hillocks where the sun beats down with the fiercest\r\nheat. There, under some large stone, it digs itself a den, a spacious\r\nretreat, whence it issues only by night in quest of something to eat.\r\nIt is never known to intrude into houses, nor does it ever leave the\r\nwarmth of its desert solitudes. Unless you disturb it by lifting up the\r\nflat stone that roofs its abode, you run no risk of encountering the\r\nsting; but woe to the reckless one who should rashly venture to rummage\r\nin that retreat. The creature’s sting is sometimes deadly, they say.\r\n\r\n“The viper makes its home, by preference, on some warm and stony\r\nhillside, where it lurks under the stones and in the tangled\r\nunderbrush. Its color is brown or reddish, with a darker zigzag stripe\r\non the back and a row of spots on each side. Its belly is of a gray\r\nslate-color, and its head, larger than the neck, is blunted as if cut\r\noff in front.\r\n\r\n“It is an extremely timid creature and never attacks man except in\r\nself-defense. Its movements are brusque, irregular, and heavy. Like all\r\nserpents it feeds on live prey, especially insects and small\r\nfield-rats. To capture these quickly and to deprive them of the power\r\nto defend themselves, the viper first inflicts a venomous wound, as\r\ndoes the scorpion.\r\n\r\n“All serpents dart out and in between their lips, with extreme\r\nvelocity, a black, thread-like member, forked at the end and of great\r\nflexibility. Many persons take this to be the reptile’s sting, though\r\nin reality it is nothing but its tongue, a tongue void of offense and\r\nused by its possessor to snap up insects and also to express, in the\r\nsnake’s peculiar manner, by quickly passing out and in between the\r\nlips, the passions that agitate the creature. All serpents have this\r\nsort of tongue, but in these regions it is only the viper that\r\npossesses the terrible weapon for inflicting venomous wounds.\r\n\r\n“This consists, first, of two fangs, or long, sharp teeth, situated in\r\nthe upper jaw. These curved teeth are movable, starting up for attack,\r\nat the reptile’s will, or lying down in a groove of the gum and\r\nremaining there as inoffensive as a stiletto in its sheath. Thus the\r\nrisk of a self-inflicted wound is avoided. These fangs are each pierced\r\nfrom end to end with a narrow channel having at the tooth’s point a\r\nminute opening through which the venom is discharged into the wound.\r\nFinally, at the base of each fang is a tiny sac filled with venomous\r\nliquid. As with the bee and the scorpion, this liquid is harmless in\r\nappearance, free from odor, and without taste—little else than water,\r\none would say. When the viper attacks with its fangs, the venom-sac\r\npresses a drop of its contents into the dental canal and the terrible\r\nliquid passes into the wound. In short, the whole operation exactly\r\ncorresponds to the similar procedure I have described in speaking of\r\nthe bee’s sting.\r\n\r\n“Let us suppose you are so imprudent as to disturb the reptile as it\r\nlies asleep in the sun. Immediately the creature uncoils itself and,\r\nwith jaws wide open, smites your hand. It is all over in a twinkling.\r\nThen, with the same rapidity, the viper recoils itself and settles back\r\nagain, continuing to threaten you, with its head once more the center\r\nof the spiral coil.\r\n\r\n“You do not wait for a second attack; you beat a hasty retreat; but,\r\nalas, the harm is done. On your wounded hand you discover two tiny red\r\nspots, apparently of little more significance than the sting of a bee.\r\nNo cause for alarm, you say to yourself if you are unacquainted with\r\nthe effects of such a wound. But it is a false reassurance.\r\n\r\n“Presently the red spots are encircled with a zone of livid hue. With a\r\ndull sensation of pain the hand becomes swollen, and gradually the\r\nswelling extends to the entire arm. Before long there follow cold\r\nsweats and a feeling of nausea, breathing is rendered difficult, vision\r\nis clouded, the intellect is torpid, and unless timely aid is rendered\r\ndeath may be the sequel.\r\n\r\n“What is to be done in the face of such danger? One must press tightly\r\nor even bind fast the finger, the hand, the arm, above the wound, in\r\norder to prevent the passage of the venom into the blood. The wound\r\nmust be made to bleed by the exercise of pressure all around it; it\r\nmust be energetically sucked to draw out the venomous liquid. I have\r\nexplained to you in speaking of the bee, and I now repeat it, that\r\nvenom is not a poison. It will not act, however powerful it be, unless\r\nit mixes with the blood. Sucking it, therefore, is without danger if\r\nthe lining of the mouth is intact.\r\n\r\n“It is plain that if, by energetic suction and by pressing until the\r\nblood flows, we succeed in extracting all the venom from the wound, the\r\nlatter will henceforth be of no serious importance. For greater\r\nsecurity, as soon as possible the wound should be cauterized with a\r\ncorrosive fluid, such as ammonia or nitric acid, or even with a red-hot\r\niron. Cauterization acts in such a manner as to destroy the venomous\r\nmatter. It is painful, I admit, but one must submit to that in order to\r\nescape something worse.\r\n\r\n“Cauterization falls within the physician’s province; but the\r\npreliminary precautions—ligature to stop the spread of the venom,\r\npressure to make the envenomed blood flow, and suction to extract the\r\nvenomous liquid—are matters for our personal attention; and all this\r\nshould be taken in hand immediately, since the longer the delay the\r\nmore serious the case becomes. When these precautions are taken it is\r\nvery seldom that the viper’s bite has fatal consequences.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII\r\n\r\nTHE PHYLLOXERA\r\n\r\n\r\n“In our talks on ants a few words were said concerning their\r\nmilch-cows, plant-lice. You haven’t forgotten those curious herds with\r\nudders in the form of two little tubes that emit, from time to time, a\r\nsweetened liquid. The ant comes and milks these cows, caressing them as\r\nit does so with its two antennæ. It fills itself with their milk,\r\nmaking its stomach serve the purpose of a milk-pail, and then runs\r\nback, all bursting with the delicious fluid, to disgorge it into the\r\nnurslings’ mouths.\r\n\r\n“These ant-cows are watched over with jealous vigilance; in case of\r\nneed they are pastured within enclosures, for fear of marauders. So far\r\nall is for the best: the ants’ cattle afford us some passing amusement,\r\nand apparently they are open to no serious reproach. But if we pursue\r\nour inquiries further the plant-lice will reveal themselves to us under\r\na far more serious aspect.\r\n\r\n“Let us speak first of rosebush lice. You wish to pluck a rose. Its\r\nperfume fills the air, its form and color rejoice the eye. But just as\r\nyou are about to break the stem what do you find under your fingers? At\r\nthe base of the flower and all over the branch that bears it, the\r\nsuperb plant is contaminated with a legion of green lice; a host of\r\nodious vermin has taken possession of it; the magnificent has\r\nassociated with it the disgusting. The eye is offended; the fingers\r\nrecoil before this species of animated bark which the slightest\r\npressure turns into a sticky mush. Let us pluck the rose nevertheless,\r\nand before shaking the lice from it let us examine them a moment.\r\n\r\n“They are light green in color, big-bellied, and wingless. With a\r\nlittle attention we distinguish the two minute posterior horns whence\r\noozes the liquid on which the ants regale themselves. They have,\r\nunderneath, a sucker, straight and very slender, a sort of bore which\r\nthey push into the tender bark to extract from it the juices on which\r\nthey live. The sucker once implanted at any convenient point, the\r\nanimalcule seldom stirs from that spot. If it does decide to move a\r\nlittle, it is because its well has run dry and it must bore another\r\nclose beside it. A promenade of merely the length of the branch is a\r\nliberty that only the most adventurous dare allow themselves. As a\r\nrule, the plant-louse sticks to the spot where it was born, to the very\r\nend.”\r\n\r\n“But how can the stem of a rose get so completely covered with those\r\nlittle green lice?” asked Emile.\r\n\r\n“That is easily explained,” answered his uncle. “Plant-lice multiply\r\nvery rapidly, since each one, without exception, from the first to the\r\nlast, whatever their number, becomes capable in a few days of\r\nprocreating a family. The newly born settle down beside their mothers,\r\nand are themselves soon surrounded by their own progeny. These in turn,\r\nin a little while, have offspring of their own; and so on,\r\nindefinitely, as long as the season lasts. Thus the stem, the branch,\r\nthe entire plant, become covered with lice so closely packed one\r\nagainst another that in places the real bark is hidden by this bark of\r\nvermin.\r\n\r\n“Have you ever seen a garden-patch of broad beans overrun by black\r\nlice? There, better than anywhere else, may be seen the rapidity of\r\npropagation. On that green expanse appears at first a small black\r\nstain, announcing the beginning of the invasion. It is a family of lice\r\ninstalled at the top of a beanstalk, the tenderest part of the plant,\r\nwhere the insects’ suckers can work to best advantage. The gardener, as\r\nsoon as he is aware of what is going on, hastens to cut off this part\r\nof the stalk and crush it under his heel. He hopes to exorcise the evil\r\nby destroying this nest of vermin.\r\n\r\n“His hope is short-lived. A few days later, instead of one plant\r\ninvaded there are dozens. He lops off again; he turns up the remaining\r\nleaves and examines them one by one; he crushes what vermin he finds,\r\ntaking all pains to make the extermination complete. Will he make an\r\nend of it this time? Not at all: the black hordes reappear in greater\r\nnumbers than ever; the invaded stalks can no longer be counted. A few\r\nlice that escaped the slaughter were enough to infest the whole patch\r\nof beans. The foliage hangs down, foul and withered; the young pods,\r\nriddled with punctures and corrugated with scars, shrivel up and can\r\ngrow no larger. For this ill there is no remedy; the harvest is ruined.\r\n\r\n“The gardener pulls it all up and throws it on the dung-hill. His care\r\nand vigilance have been unable to arrest the invasion. In vain he\r\ncrushed legions at a time under his angry heel: in a few days the\r\nhalf-dozen survivors had propagated a larger colony than ever. Man is\r\nhardly in a position to contend successfully against this lowly vermin\r\nwhich braves extinction by virtue of its countless numbers.\r\n\r\n“As I told you, the plant-louse does not like to change its place. It\r\nplants its sucker on the very spot where it has just been born, and\r\nthenceforth sticks to that spot, filling its stomach with sap and\r\nsurrounding itself with a family. This love of repose explains to us\r\nvery well how the twig of a rosebush or the top of a beanstalk\r\nundergoes a progressive colonization; but it does not account for the\r\ndistant propagation of the species.\r\n\r\n“With its home-keeping habits the insect ought to be confined within\r\nnarrow limits, on a single leaf and not on all leaves, on one rosebush\r\nand not on the neighboring rosebushes. But as a matter of fact it is\r\ndisseminated everywhere. When one patch of beans becomes infested,\r\nthose in the neighborhood are equally unfortunate; when one rosebush\r\nshows a colony of plant-lice, all those around it are similarly\r\nvisited. No vegetable growth can defend itself from the pest. How,\r\nthen, is it that this obese animalcule, which totters with fatigue\r\nafter one step forward, succeeds in passing from rosebush to rosebush,\r\nfrom garden to garden? By what means is it able to spread in all\r\ndirections without limit?\r\n\r\n“Let us examine a number of rosebushes, and we shall have a prompt\r\nanswer to our question. In addition to the wingless plant-lice, big of\r\nbelly and all grouped on the tender twigs, we shall see others, green\r\nlike the first ones, but more elegant in form, of greater freedom of\r\nmovement, and provided with four wings, very beautiful wings too,\r\ndiaphanous and gleaming with rainbow tints. These creatures are no lazy\r\nsap-bibbers forever squatting over the well their sucker has bored.\r\nThey are seen to come and go, circulating briskly among the stationary\r\nherd, inspecting the foliage, passing from branch to branch, and even\r\ntaking flight for some distant goal. They are the travelers of the\r\nfamily. Their function is to propagate the race in the surrounding\r\ndistrict, with the aid of their wings, and even at considerable\r\ndistances when a puff of wind carries them thus far.\r\n\r\n“Two classes, then, dissimilar though related, are to be noted among\r\nthe green lice of the rosebush and the black ones of the beanstalk, as\r\nalso among countless others. The members of one class have no wings;\r\nthey pass their lives where they were born, and multiply in serried\r\nlegions. Those of the other class, which is relatively small, are\r\nequipped with wings. Confined to no one spot, they fare forth as some\r\npassing breeze or their own strength of wing may determine, and deposit\r\nin favorable localities the germs that are to serve each as the\r\nbeginning of a community of wingless plant-lice. The first kind\r\nprocreate on the spot with a fecundity almost beyond belief; the second\r\ntake leave of the stationary family and go out to start new centers of\r\npopulation in various quarters. The first propagate without limit; the\r\nsecond colonize.\r\n\r\n“To soil the stem of a rose with a coating of lice is not exactly a\r\ncapital offense; but to lay waste a field of beans, the hope of the\r\nfarmer, is a far more serious matter. Yet even that is as nothing when\r\ncompared with other depredations committed by plant-lice. There is a\r\nspecies of these insects that lives underground, subsisting on the\r\nroots of the grape-vine. Oh, the hateful creature! Never has\r\nagriculture known anything to equal the ravages it commits; no floods\r\nor droughts or inclement seasons have ever wrought such woes. Its\r\nterrible sucker has, up to the present time, caused us losses estimated\r\nat the fabulous sum of ten milliard francs. What a mouthful for a\r\nmiserable little louse hardly visible to the naked eye! And to think\r\nthat the combined efforts of nations cannot succeed in exterminating\r\nthis pest! Alas, how feeble is mere force when confronted with the\r\nexceedingly minute infinitely multiplied!\r\n\r\n“This destroyer of the vine is known as the phylloxera, a name strange\r\nto our tongue, but losing nothing of its impressiveness in translation.\r\n‘Phylloxera’ means ‘witherer of leaves.’ The plant-louse thus\r\ndenominated does indeed cause the foliage of the vine to wither up—not\r\nacting on the leaves directly, it is true, but attacking the roots.\r\nThese, done to death by the insect’s sucker, cease to draw from the\r\nsoil the nourishment needed by the vine. The vine-stock wastes away,\r\nand with it the leaves, which become yellow and withered.\r\n\r\n“It is not merely the foliage, then, that the phylloxera dries up; it\r\nwithers and kills the whole vine. Moreover, the name it bears was not\r\ninvented expressly for it, but was borne by another before the ravager\r\nof vineyards became known. The louse that was first called phylloxera\r\nlived at the expense of the oak-tree and took up its station on the\r\nleaves, sucking the sap from them. There you have the true witherer of\r\nleaves. The vineyard louse has therefore inherited an old appellation\r\nwhich fails to indicate fully the seriousness of the creature’s\r\ndepredations.\r\n\r\n“This last-named insect is a tiny yellowish louse, plump of body, but\r\nhardly discernible to untrained eyes, its length being barely three\r\nquarters of a millimeter. It lives in clusters on the minute\r\nramifications of the roots wherever the bark is tender enough to enable\r\nit to push in its sucker. Its ranks are so dense that the infested\r\nrootlets wear a continuous coating of vermin which stains the fingers\r\nwith yellow. It lays its eggs in little heaps in the interstices that\r\noccur in the swarming colony; and these eggs are oval in shape and\r\nsulphur-yellow at first, but turn brownish as the moment for hatching\r\napproaches.\r\n\r\n“From these eggs there come, in a few days, new layers of eggs, which\r\nsettle down beside the earlier comers and add their own progeny to the\r\nalready overgrown family. Thus, as long as the season continues\r\nfavorable, these myriad numbers of successive generations are added to\r\nthe existing myriads, until the thread-like rootlets become completely\r\nhidden by the accumulated layers of eggs and the eggs themselves.\r\n\r\n“Riddled with punctures, the rootlets swell up at intervals and present\r\nthe appearance of a string of elongated seeds. Thus deformed, fatally\r\ninjured in their delicate suckers, the roots cease to imbibe the\r\nnutritive juices of the soil, the famished vine languishes for a time,\r\nputting forth only feeble shoots that are incapable of bearing fruit,\r\nand at last the whole plant dries up and dies. To secure its own\r\nprosperity the louse has killed its nurse.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII\r\n\r\nTHE PHYLLOXERA\r\n\r\n(Continued)\r\n\r\n\r\n“The yellow plant-louse found on the roots of the grape-vine,” resumed\r\nUncle Paul, “has no bent for traveling: wingless, sluggish, and\r\nbig-bellied, it is ill adapted to locomotion. Where once its sucker has\r\nimplanted itself, there the creature is glad to abide as long as the\r\nplace is tenable. But when the rootlet dies and begins to decay, then a\r\nnew refectory must be sought out, with a better-furnished table.\r\nAccordingly the louse has to move. A persistent explorer, it knows how,\r\nwith patience and in course of time, to make its way through cracks in\r\nthe soil from one root to another, and dares even to climb to the\r\nsurface, where, proceeding in the open air, it emigrates from the\r\nexhausted vine-stock to the neighboring one rich in sap; and there it\r\npushes down to the roots through some fissure in the ground.\r\n\r\n“To this slow-goer a single one of our steps would be a journey of\r\nexcessive length. Therefore, to propagate its kind far and wide, it\r\nmust have other and quicker means than the extremely deliberate method\r\nof locomotion just described. This other method for planting colonies\r\nat a considerable distance has already been illustrated for us by the\r\ngreen louse of the rosebush. Like that species, the phylloxera has a\r\nspecial division of winged travelers, and it is these that propagate\r\nthe race throughout the grape-growing district.\r\n\r\n“At the time of the greatest midsummer heat there make their\r\nappearance, amid the throng of yellow lice covering the roots, certain\r\nindividuals with longer bodies, which soon change their skin and then\r\nbear on their sides two pairs of black stumps, the sheaths of four\r\nfuture wings. These are the nymphs destined for emigration. These\r\nnymphs leave their subterranean abode and climb up to the foot of the\r\nvine-stock, or sometimes even out upon the surface of the ground. There\r\nanother change of skin takes place, whereupon we behold the winged\r\ninsect, superior in form to its underground relatives.\r\n\r\n“It measures a little more than a millimeter in length, not including\r\nthe wings. These latter, transparent and iridescent, extend far beyond\r\nthe length of the body, and the upper ones are wide, rounded, and\r\nslightly smoke-colored at the end, the lower ones narrow and shorter.\r\nThey are supported by strong sinews that denote great power of flight.\r\nWith its large, diaphanous wings, its broad head and big eyes, its\r\nbelly ending in a blunt point, and its yellowish color, the traveling\r\ninsect bears some resemblance to a very small cicada. Such, in brief,\r\nis the phylloxera commissioned to propagate the race at a distance.\r\n\r\n“We have here no longer to do with the sluggish pot-bellied creature\r\nthat needs all its strength to move from one root to the next\r\nadjoining; we behold an agile denizen of the air, capable of covering\r\nwith the swiftness of an arrow a distance of several leagues,\r\nespecially when aided by a favorable wind. During the warm season of\r\nJuly and August these winged insects take flight and settle in swarms\r\non the vineyards not yet ravaged. They alight on the leaves, where\r\ntheir suckers perform their function in sober moderation.\r\n\r\n“To stuff themselves like gluttons, after the manner of their kindred\r\nthat live on the roots, is not their way. Hence their own depredations\r\nare of no importance. Unfortunately, however, it is their mission to do\r\nus a most disastrous disservice by infesting, one after another, the\r\nadjacent vineyards, peopling the still unaffected districts with\r\nunderground ravagers. All take part in this; all, without exception,\r\nset to work laying eggs.\r\n\r\n“These eggs are few in number, it is true, each insect laying at most\r\nbut half a score amid the cotton-like down of the buds and young\r\nleaves. But the aggregate is none the less enormous, since in this\r\nstrange family we have thus far encountered none but mothers. We have\r\njust seen that all the wingless phylloxeras on the roots lay eggs, and\r\nnow we find that all their winged kindred on the leaves do likewise.\r\n\r\n“This excessive fecundity would in the end exhaust the insect and\r\nresult in its extinction if there were no seasons of quietude for\r\nrenewing the vitality of the race. Yellowish in color like the eggs of\r\nthe underground phylloxera, those of the winged insect are of two\r\nkinds: one of a larger size, the other only about half as large. The\r\nfirst produce females, the second males. Here, at last, we have the two\r\nsexes, whose coöperation will assure indefinite prosperity to the race.\r\nThat is the normal order governing all animal life.\r\n\r\n“But what queer little creatures! Yellow, wingless, stubby, they look\r\nlike the lice on the roots, but even smaller. These phylloxeras of the\r\nthird kind are dwarfs in a family of dwarfs. They have no stomachs for\r\ndigesting, no suckers for puncturing the leaves and extracting their\r\nsap. Self-nourishment, however slight, is not at all their affair. The\r\nlaying of eggs that shall renew the vigor of the race, the placing of\r\nthem where they will be safe, and then a speedy death—that is the sole\r\npurpose of their brief span of life.\r\n\r\n“For some days these dwarfs, male and female, wander over the vines and\r\nmate, one with another; then, in the fissures of the wrinkled bark, the\r\nmothers lay each an egg, a single egg, of enormous size in comparison\r\nwith the smallness of the layer, greenish in color and sprinkled with\r\nfine black spots. This egg takes the name of ‘winter egg,’ being\r\ndestined to pass the cold season fastened by a little hook to the\r\nvine’s bark. After this the layer of the egg shrivels up into a reddish\r\npoint and dies.”\r\n\r\n“But how do these eggs manage to get through the winter without\r\nfreezing?” asked Louis. “Hens’ eggs or birds’ eggs would be good for\r\nnothing after being left out-doors from autumn till spring.”\r\n\r\n“That is true,” assented Uncle Paul; “nevertheless these minute germs\r\nof future insect life seldom fail to hatch when warm weather returns.\r\nFrom them come plant-lice like those on the roots of the vine. Each\r\nnew-born louse crawls down the natal vine, hunts around on the ground\r\nuntil it finds a crack in the soil, and then makes its way through this\r\nfissure to settle at last on a rootlet, into which it plunges its\r\nsucker. At ease thenceforth beneath the surface of the ground and in\r\nthe bosom of abundance, it does not long remain alone. Close to its\r\nfixed position it deposits its little heap of yellow eggs, whence there\r\nquickly issues a new generation. In like manner each member of the\r\nfamily surrounds itself with a family of its own; and so on by several\r\nsuccessive repetitions of the process until, from having but a single\r\noccupant at first, a root speedily becomes covered with a legion of\r\ndestroyers. To this population of recent origin we must not forget to\r\nadd the older inhabitants that have passed the winter under ground and\r\nhave only waited for the return of the warm season to resume their own\r\nlaying of eggs on the roots of the vine.\r\n\r\n“Let us recapitulate these singular ways of the phylloxera. The species\r\ncomprises three forms of insects, each having its own peculiar\r\nstructure, its manner of life, its separate function. The customary\r\nanimal unity is here a trinity: three different insects are grouped in\r\na single species.\r\n\r\n“The sedentary members are wingless and live on the roots. All lay eggs\r\nand are followed by several generations likewise capable of laying\r\neggs. Under the pricking of their collective suckers, numberless in the\r\naggregate, vineyards are ruined. There we have the formidable foe, the\r\nravager whose sucker, hardly visible to the naked eye, has already cost\r\nus more than ten milliard francs.\r\n\r\n“The migrating members are furnished with large wings. They live on the\r\nleaves and lay each a small number of eggs in the down of the buds.\r\nLike their sedentary kinsfolk, they all lay eggs. Their peculiar office\r\nis to disseminate the race from one vineyard to another.\r\n\r\n“The members endowed with sex come under the operation of the general\r\nlaw: they are divided into male and female. Unprovided with wings,\r\nsucker, or stomach, they wander over the vine without taking any\r\nnourishment. Each mother lays a single egg, the winter egg, whence\r\nissues in the spring a sedentary phylloxera, which makes its way down\r\nto the roots, establishes itself there, and becomes the head and center\r\nof a new colony.\r\n\r\n“How contend against this foe which, by reason of its numbers and its\r\nunderground abode, defies our attempts to exterminate it? Three\r\nprincipal methods are employed. In the lowlands the vineyards are\r\nflooded and kept under a good depth of water throughout the winter.\r\nThis submersion causes the death of the phylloxera at the roots of the\r\nplant. As a second method, through holes bored to the roots the soil is\r\ninjected with an asphyxiating fluid called sulphur of carbon, the fumes\r\nof which instantly kill all insects that they reach. The difficulty is\r\nto do a thorough job and leave no survivors. A third device is employed\r\nby those who import from America certain wild vines much hardier than\r\nour cultivated ones, but producing inferior fruit. These American\r\nplants resist the attacks of the phylloxera, and continue to flourish\r\nwhere our vines would succumb. On these wild stocks, as soon as they\r\nare well rooted, are grafted our native vines, and thus is obtained a\r\ngrape-vine of two-fold quality, resisting by the hardy nature of its\r\nroot the phylloxera’s assaults, and bearing, on its engrafted shoots,\r\nthe incomparable fruit of our old vineyards.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIV\r\n\r\nNOCTURNAL BIRDS OF PREY\r\n\r\n\r\n“The brown owl, the horned owl, the barn-owl and other species of this\r\nfamily, are known under the name of nocturnal birds of prey. They are\r\ncalled birds of prey because they live on the small animals that they\r\ncatch, such as rats and mice, both those that infest our houses and\r\nthose that live in the fields. Owls are, among birds, what cats are\r\namong quadrupeds,—the inveterate foes of all those small rodents of\r\nwhich the mouse is our most familiar example.\r\n\r\n“The French language has recognized this analogy in its term chat-huant\r\n[7] (hooting cat) applied to a certain kind of owl. This bird is, in\r\nsome sort, a cat in its manner of living, a cat that flies and that\r\nutters a long-drawn cry like a plaintive howl. It is nocturnal; in\r\nother words, it keeps itself hidden by day in some obscure retreat,\r\nwhence it comes forth only at nightfall, to hunt in the twilight and\r\nunder the rays of the moon.\r\n\r\n“Owls have eyes of remarkable size, round, and both in a frontal\r\nposition instead of being placed one on each side of the head. A broad\r\nrim of fine feathers encircles each eye. The reason for their great\r\nsize is found in the bird’s nocturnal habits. Having to seek its food\r\nby a very feeble light, it must, in order to see with any distinctness,\r\nhave eyes that admit as much light as possible; that is, eyes that open\r\nvery wide.\r\n\r\n“But this wide-openness of the eyes, so advantageous by night, is a\r\nserious inconvenience to the owl in the bright light of day. Dazzled,\r\nblinded, by the sun’s rays, the bird of darkness keeps itself in hiding\r\nand dares not venture forth; but if forced to do so, it observes the\r\nutmost circumspection, flying with cautious hesitation and by short\r\nstages. The other birds, those accustomed to broad daylight, come and\r\ninsult it at will. Robin redbreast and the tomtit are the first to pay\r\ntheir compliments in this manner, and are followed by the chaffinch,\r\nthe jay, and many others.”\r\n\r\n“And doesn’t the owl do anything to get even with them?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“Very little,” replied his uncle. “Perched on a branch of some tree,\r\nthe night bird answers its aggressors by a grotesque balancing of its\r\nbody, turning its large head this way and that in a ridiculous fashion,\r\nand rolling its eyes in bewildered alarm. Its menaces are vain: the\r\nsmallest and weakest birds are its boldest tormentors, pecking it and\r\npulling its feathers without its daring to defend itself.\r\n\r\n“Because of its wide-open eyes the nocturnal bird of prey needs a\r\nsubdued light like that of early dawn and of evening dusk. It is,\r\ntherefore, at nightfall and at the first signs of daybreak that these\r\nbirds leave their retreats and seek their prey. At these hours their\r\nhunt is a fruitful one, for they find the rats and mice, whether those\r\nthat lurk about our houses and barns or those that live in the field,\r\neither fast asleep or on the point of going to sleep. Moonlight nights\r\nare the most favorable for the nocturnal bird’s purposes. Such nights\r\nare nights of plenty, affording opportunity for protracted hunting and\r\nmany captures.\r\n\r\n“Let us follow the owl on its nocturnal expedition. The moment is\r\npropitious, the air is calm, the moon shines. The bird leaves its\r\nsylvan retreat; it skims over the open field, the meadow, the prairie;\r\nit inspects the furrows where the field-mouse lurks, the long grass\r\nwhere it burrows, the ruins of deserted buildings where both rats and\r\nmice scamper about.\r\n\r\n“Its flight is noiseless, its silent wing cleaving the air without the\r\nfaintest sound. It is careful not to give the alarm to its destined\r\nvictims. This noiseless flight it owes to the structure of its\r\nfeathers, which are silky and finely divided. Nothing betrays its\r\nsudden coming, and the prey is seized without even suspecting the\r\nenemy’s presence. An extraordinarily keen sense of hearing, on the\r\nother hand, advises the bird of all that is going on in the\r\nneighborhood. Its ears, large and deep, perceive the mere rustle of a\r\nfield-mouse in the grass.\r\n\r\n“The prey is seized with two strong claws warmly clothed in feathers\r\nclear down to the very nails. Each foot has four toes, of which three\r\nordinarily point forward, and one backward; but, by a privilege common\r\nto nocturnal birds of prey, one of the anterior toes is movable and can\r\npoint backward, so that the claw becomes divided into two pairs of\r\nequally powerful grippers when the bird wishes to seize, as in a vise,\r\nthe branch whereon it perches or the victim struggling to escape.\r\n\r\n“A blow of the beak breaks the head of the captured rat. This beak is\r\nshort and hooked, and the two mandibles have great mobility, which\r\nenables them, in striking against each other, to make a rapid clacking,\r\na demonstration by which the bird expresses anger or alarm.\r\n\r\n“The mandibles open wide in the act of swallowing, revealing a mouth of\r\nample proportions and a throat of excessive width. The prey, which has\r\nfirst been well kneaded by the claws, disappears down this throat,\r\nbones and all. Nothing is left of the rat or the mouse, not even the\r\nfur.\r\n\r\n“Digestion completed, there remains in the stomach a confused mass of\r\nskins turned inside out and still wearing their fur, and bones stripped\r\nas clean as if they had been scraped with a knife. The bird then\r\nproceeds to rid itself of this encumbrance of innutritious matter.\r\nGrotesque retchings indicate the labor of this deliverance. Something\r\nmakes its way upward through the extended throat, the beak opens, and\r\nthe act is accomplished. A rounded mass falls to the ground, composed\r\nof skins, bones, hair, scales—in fact, everything that has defied\r\ndigestion. All nocturnal birds of prey have this ignoble manner of\r\nfreeing the stomach: they vomit in globular form the residue of their\r\nprey after the latter has been swallowed whole.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV\r\n\r\nTHE SMALLER BIRDS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Almost all the smaller birds are helpful to us in protecting the\r\nfruits of the earth from the ravages of insects. Their services deserve\r\nto be recorded in a long and detailed history, but time for that is\r\nlacking and we must confine ourselves to brief mention of a few of\r\nthese valiant caterpillar-destroyers.\r\n\r\n“The titmouse, or tomtit, is a small bird full of life and showing a\r\npetulant humor. Always in action, it flits from tree to tree, examines\r\nthe branches with minute particularity, perches on the swaying end of\r\nthe frailest twig, where it clings persistently even though hanging\r\nhead downward, accommodating itself to the oscillations of its flexible\r\nsupport without once relaxing its clutch or ceasing its scrutiny of the\r\nworm-infested buds, which it tears open in order to get at the enclosed\r\nvermin and insect-eggs.\r\n\r\n“It is calculated that a tomtit rids us of three hundred thousand of\r\nthese eggs every year. It has to supply the needs of a family seldom\r\nequalled in size; but the support of twenty young ones, or even more,\r\nis not too heavy a burden for this active bird to bear. With this\r\ninfant brood on its hands, it must give constant and careful inspection\r\nto buds and to fissures in the bark, in order to catch larvæ, spiders,\r\ncaterpillars, little worms of all kinds, and thus find food for twenty\r\nbeaks incessantly agape with hunger at the bottom of the nest.\r\n\r\n“Let us suppose the mother bird to arrive with a caterpillar. The nest\r\nis immediately all in a tumult: twenty beaks are stretched wide open,\r\nbut only a single one receives the morsel, while nineteen are kept\r\nwaiting. The indefatigable mother flies off again, and when the\r\ntwentieth beak has at last been fed, the first has long since begun\r\nagain its importunate demands. What a multitude of worms such a brood\r\nmust consume!\r\n\r\n“Whole families of birds devote themselves, as does the titmouse, to\r\nthis patient quest for insect eggs in the crevices of tree-trunks or\r\nconcealed in rolled-up leaves, for larvæ between the scales of buds and\r\nin worm-holes in wood, and for insects hidden in cracks and crannies.\r\nIn this kind of hunt the bird does not have to chase its game and catch\r\nit by superior swiftness of flight; it must simply know how to find it\r\nin its lair. To this end it needs a keen eye and a slender beak; wings\r\nplay but a secondary part.\r\n\r\n“But other species spend their energies in the free open-air chase:\r\nthey pursue their game on the wing, hunting for gnats, moths,\r\nmosquitoes, and flying beetles. They must have a short beak, but one\r\nthat opens wide and snaps up unerringly insects on the wing, despite\r\nthe uncertainties of aërial flight; a beak in which the victim is\r\ncaught and held without any retardation of the bird’s swift course; in\r\nshort, a beak with a sticky lining which a tiny butterfly cannot so\r\nmuch as graze with its wing and not become entangled. Above all, an\r\nuntiring and swift wing is necessary, one that does not flag in the\r\npursuit of game desperately putting forth its utmost efforts to escape,\r\nand one that is not baffled by the tortuous course of a moth driven to\r\nbay. A beak inordinately cleft and wings of extraordinary power—such,\r\nin a word, should be the equipment of the bird whose hunting ground is\r\nthe vast expanse of the open air.\r\n\r\n“These conditions are fulfilled in the highest degree in the swallow\r\nand the martin, both of which hunt flying insects, pursuing them this\r\nway and that, back and forth, ceaselessly and with a thousand subtle\r\ntricks. They catch them in their wide-open and viscous gullet, and\r\ncontinue their course without a moment’s pause.\r\n\r\n“The bird that lives on grain and seeds, the granivorous bird, as it is\r\ncalled, has a beak that is very wide at the base and adapted by its\r\nstrength to the opening of the hardest seeds. In this class are the\r\nchaffinch, the greenfinch, the linnet, the goldfinch, and the swallow.\r\nThe bird that lives on insects, or the insectivorous bird, has a beak\r\nthat is fine and slender, in delicacy proportioned to the softness of\r\nits prey. To this number belong the nightingale, the warbler, the\r\nfallow-finch, and the wagtail. Agriculture has no better defenders\r\nagainst the ravages of worms than these little birds with slender\r\nbeaks, voracious devourers as they are of larvæ and insects.\r\n\r\n“But the granivorous birds have certain grave faults: some of them are\r\naddicted to pilfering in the grain-fields and know how to get the wheat\r\nout of the ear, and some even come boldly to the poultry-yard to share\r\nwith its inmates the oats thrown to them by the farmer’s wife. Others\r\nprefer the juicy flesh of fruit, and know sooner than we when the\r\ncherries are ripe and the pears mellow. Such failings, however, are\r\namply atoned for by services rendered. The granivores pick up in the\r\nfields an infinite number of seeds of all sorts which, if left to\r\ngerminate, would infest our crops with weeds.\r\n\r\n“To this rôle of weeder they add a second not less meritorious. Grain\r\nand seeds are, it is true, their regular diet; but insects are to few\r\nof them so despicable as to be refused when sufficiently plentiful and\r\neasy to catch. Indeed, we can go still further in our commendation of\r\nthese birds: in their early days when, feeble and featherless, they\r\nreceive their nourishment by the beakful from their parents, many of\r\nthem are fed on insects.\r\n\r\n“Let us take for example the house-sparrow. Here we have, it must be\r\nadmitted, an inveterate devourer of grain. He robs our dove-cotes and\r\npoultry-yards, steals their food from the pigeons and the hens, and\r\nanticipates the farmer in reaping the grain-crops near his house. Many\r\nother misdeeds are to be reckoned against him. He plunders the\r\ncherry-trees, commits petty larceny in the garden, plucks up sprouting\r\nseeds, and regales himself on young lettuce and the first leaves of\r\ngreen peas. But as soon as the season of insect-eggs opens, this\r\nshameless pilferer becomes one of our most valuable helpers. Twenty\r\ntimes an hour, at least, the mother and the father take turns in\r\nbringing the beakful of food to their little ones; and each time the\r\nbill of fare consists of a caterpillar, or an insect large enough to be\r\ndivided into quarters, or perhaps a fat larva, or it may be a\r\ngrasshopper, or some other kind of small game.\r\n\r\n“In one week the young brood consumes about three thousand insects,\r\nlarvæ, caterpillars and worms of all species. There have been counted\r\nin the immediate vicinity of a single nest of sparrows the remains of\r\nseven hundred June-bugs, besides those of innumerable smaller insects.\r\nThat is the supply of food required for rearing only one brood. Let us\r\nthen, my children, wish well to all the little birds that deliver us\r\nfrom that formidable ravager, the insect.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI\r\n\r\nBIRDS’ NESTS\r\n\r\n\r\n“It is in the building of nests destined for the rearing of a family of\r\nyoung ones that the bird shows in a remarkable way that wonderful\r\nfaculty which enables the little creature to accomplish, without\r\nprevious training, results that would seem to require the intervention\r\nof reasoned experience.\r\n\r\n“These adepts in bird-nest architecture have talents of the most varied\r\nsort. There are diggers, who scoop out a hollow in the sand; miners,\r\nwho excavate a little cell to which a long and narrow passage gives\r\naccess; carpenters, who bore into the trunk of a worm-eaten tree;\r\nmasons, who work with mortar made of earth tempered with saliva;\r\nbasket-makers, who weave together small twigs and fine roots; tailors,\r\nwho with a filament of bark for thread and the beak for needle sew a\r\nfew leaves together into a cornet for holding the mattress on which the\r\nyoung brood will rest; workers in felt, who make a fabric of down,\r\nhair, or cotton, that rivals our own similar products; and builders of\r\nfortresses, who protect their nest with an impenetrable thicket as a\r\nrampart.\r\n\r\n“The goldfinch, that pretty little red-headed bird which feeds on the\r\nseeds of thistles, builds a wonderfully wrought nest in the fork of\r\nsome flexible branch. The outside is made of moss and the silky down of\r\nthistle-seeds and dandelions, while the inside, artistically rounded,\r\nis lined with a thick cushion of horse-hair, wool, and feathers.\r\n\r\n“The chaffinch builds its nest in nearly the same way, but, more\r\nmistrustful than the goldfinch, it covers the outside of its abode with\r\na layer of gray lichen which, merging with the lichen growing naturally\r\non the branch, serves to baffle the scrutiny of the bird-nest hunter.\r\n\r\n“The window-swallow makes its nest in the corners of windows, under the\r\neaves of roofs, and in the shelter of cornices. Its building material\r\nis fine earth, chiefly that left in little piles after its digestion by\r\nearth-worms in fields and gardens. The swallow fetches it, a beakful at\r\na time, moistens it with a little viscous saliva to make it stick\r\ntogether, and deposits it in courses, shaping the structure into a sort\r\nof hemispherical bowl fastened to the wall and having a narrow mouth at\r\nthe top to allow the bird to squeeze through. Bits of straw embedded in\r\nthis masonry of earth serve to give it greater solidity. Finally, the\r\ninside is upholstered with a quantity of fine feathers.\r\n\r\n“The chimney-swallow chooses a similar situation for its nest and uses\r\nthe same building-materials, but the nest itself takes a different\r\nform. Instead of a hemispherical structure entered by a very small\r\nopening, it builds a cup-shaped nest, of no great depth and wide-open\r\nat the top.\r\n\r\n“Swallows like to live together in large numbers, so that their nests\r\nare sometimes found touching one another in colonies of several\r\nhundreds under the same cornice. Each pair recognizes unerringly its\r\nown belongings and respects scrupulously the property of others, in\r\nreturn for like respect paid to its own. There is among them a deep\r\nsense of solidarity, and they render mutual aid with no less\r\nintelligence than zeal.\r\n\r\n“Sometimes it chances that a nest has hardly been finished when it\r\ncrumbles to pieces, the mortar used having been of poor quality, or\r\nelse the masons, with injudicious haste, having had too little patience\r\nto let one course dry before laying another on top of it. At the news\r\nof this mishap neighbors of both sexes hasten up to console the\r\nunfortunates and to lend their aid in rebuilding. All apply themselves\r\nto the task, fetching mortar of the first quality, and straws and\r\nfeathers, with such ardor and enthusiasm that in two days the nest is\r\ncompletely rebuilt. Left to their own unaided efforts, the afflicted\r\npair would have needed a fortnight to repair the disaster.\r\n\r\n“The golden oriole is one of the most beautiful birds of our clime.\r\nAbout as large as the blackbird, it has plumage of a superb yellow,\r\nexcept the wings, which are black. In building its nest it selects, in\r\nsome tall tree, a long and flexible bough with a fork at the end.\r\nBetween the two branches of this fork a hammock is woven for receiving\r\nthe nest. Strands of fine bark that has become shredded by long\r\nexposure to wind and weather are used for this work of art. These\r\nstrands or cords pass from one side of the fork to the other, enlacing\r\nthem, crossing and recrossing, and thus forming a sort of pocket,\r\nfirmly fixed and securely hung.\r\n\r\n“Broad blades of grass consolidate the structure. Then in this hammock\r\na mattress of the finest straw and having the form of an oval cup is\r\nput together. The completed work bears some resemblance to those\r\nelegant little wool-lined wicker baskets that are used as nests for\r\ncaged canaries.\r\n\r\n“The long-tailed titmouse, remarkable for its excessive caudal\r\ndevelopment, which constitutes more than half the total length of its\r\nbody, lives in the woods during the summer season, and comes into our\r\ngardens and orchards only in winter. It is a small bird with a reddish\r\nback and white breast. The stomach is tinged with red; the neck and\r\ncheeks are white.\r\n\r\n“Its nest is built sometimes in the fork of a high branch in a clump of\r\nbushes, and sometimes in the dense underwood of a thicket, a few feet\r\nfrom the ground; but it is most often attached to the trunk of a willow\r\nor a poplar tree. Its shape is that of a very large cocoon, and its\r\nentrance is at one side, about an inch from the top. On the outside it\r\nis made of lichens like those that cover the tree, in order to blend\r\nwith the bark and deceive the eye of the passer-by. Fibers of wool\r\nserve to hold all the parts securely together. To make the dome of the\r\nnest rain-proof, it is formed of a sort of thick felt composed of bits\r\nof moss and cobwebs. The inside resembles an oven with cup-shaped\r\nbottom and very high top, and is furnished with a remarkably thick bed\r\nof downy feathers, whereon repose from sixteen to twenty little birds,\r\narranged with careful order in the restricted space no larger, at the\r\nmost, than the hollow of one’s hand. By what miracle of parsimonious\r\neconomy do these twenty little ones with their mother manage to find\r\nroom for themselves in this tiny abode? And how in the world can tails\r\never grow to such length there?\r\n\r\n“The nest of the swinging titmouse is still more remarkable. In our\r\ncountry this bird is hardly ever found except on the banks of the lower\r\nRhone. It hangs its nest very high, on the tip-end of some swaying\r\nbranch of a tree at the water-side, so that its brood is gently rocked\r\nby the breeze sweeping over the river.”\r\n\r\n“Why, I should think,” put in Emile, “there would be danger of the\r\nyoung birds’ spilling out of such a swinging nest.”\r\n\r\n“Not at all,” replied his uncle. “The shape of the nest provides\r\nagainst that. It is a sort of oval purse about as large as a\r\nwine-bottle, with a small opening at one side, near the top. This\r\nopening is prolonged like the neck of a bottle and will at the utmost\r\nadmit one’s finger. To pass through so narrow an entrance, the\r\ntitmouse, small as it is, must stretch the elastic wall, which yields a\r\nlittle and then contracts again. This purse, as I have called it, is\r\nmade of the cotton-like flock that comes from the ripening seeds of\r\npoplars and willows in May. The titmouse gathers these bits of down and\r\nweaves them together with a woof of wool and hemp. The fabric thus\r\nobtained is not unlike the felt of a cheap hat.\r\n\r\n“It would be useless to seek an explanation of the bird’s astonishing\r\nsuccess in manufacturing, with no implements but beak and claws, a\r\ntextile that man’s skilful hand, left to its own resources, would be\r\nunable to produce; and this success the bird achieves with no previous\r\napprenticeship, without hesitation and without ever having seen the\r\nthing done by others. At the very first trial the titmouse surpasses in\r\nits art our weavers and fullers.\r\n\r\n“The top of the nest includes in its thickness the end of the branch\r\nfrom which it hangs, with the terminal twigs of that branch, which\r\nserve as framework for the nest’s vaulted roof, while the foliage\r\nprojecting through the sides of the nest protects it with its shade.\r\nFinally, to secure greater firmness of support, a cordage of wool and\r\nhemp is passed around the branch and interlaced with the felt of the\r\nnest. The inside of this hanging habitation is lined with down of the\r\nfinest quality from the poplar tree.\r\n\r\n“Are you acquainted with the troglodyte or, as it is more commonly\r\ncalled, the wren? It is the smallest of our birds, and it too is a\r\nmaster in the art of nest-building. Clothed in reddish brown, with\r\ndrooping wing and upturned beak and tail, it is always frisking,\r\nhopping, and twittering,—teederee, teeree, teeree. Every winter it\r\ncomes flying about our houses, frequenting the wood-pile, inspecting\r\nholes in the wall, and prying into the densest thickets. At a distance\r\nit might be mistaken for a small rat.\r\n\r\n“In summer it lives in the pathless woods. There, under the shelter of\r\nsome big root that lies close to the ground and is covered with a thick\r\nfleece of moss, it builds a nest patterned after that of the swinging\r\ntitmouse. Its materials are bits of moss, selected for the purpose of\r\nmaking the nest undistinguishable in appearance from that to which it\r\nis attached. The bird gathers these materials and works them into the\r\nshape of a large, hollow ball with a very small opening on one side.\r\nThe interior is upholstered with feathers.\r\n\r\n“The magpie fixes its dwelling in the top of some lofty tree whence, as\r\nfrom an observatory, it can spy from afar the approaching enemy. At the\r\njuncture of a number of branching twigs that offer adequate support it\r\nplants its nest, constructed of interlacing flexible sticks with a\r\nfloor of tempered earth. Fine rootlets, blades of grass, and a few\r\ntufts of down form the bedding for the prospective brood.\r\n\r\n“So far there is nothing to differentiate the structure from ordinary\r\nnests; but now we behold the exhibition of a special talent on the\r\nmagpie’s part. The entire nest, and more particularly its upper part,\r\nis surrounded by a thick rampart, a sort of fortified enclosure\r\ncomposed of thorny twigs securely intertwined. One would take the whole\r\nthing for a shapeless mass of brushwood. Through this rampart, on the\r\nside that is most strongly defended, an opening is left of just\r\nsufficient size to admit of the mother’s entrance and exit. It is the\r\nonly door to the aërial fortress.\r\n\r\n“Let us turn now to a bird that builds upon piling. It is a warbler of\r\nlarge size, called the great sedge-warbler or river-thrush. It selects\r\na cluster of four or five reeds that project above the surface of a\r\npond, with their stalks rooted in the mud under the water and growing\r\nnear together. These slender piles, the tops of which the bird brings\r\ninto such proximity as may be desired and fastens with connecting\r\nstrands, are made to bear an interlacing of flexible materials, such as\r\nrushes, bark-fibers, and long blades of grass. It is a basket-weaver’s\r\njob, with a framework of reeds as a basis for the structure. Finally,\r\nin this basket, which is made much longer than wide, is placed the nest\r\nproper, a warm little bed of cotton-like down, spiders’ webs, and wool.\r\n\r\n“But this abode resting on piles above the water is exposed to two\r\ndangers,—the swaying of the reeds which, bent over by the wind, might\r\nincline the nest so that it would spill its contents either of eggs or\r\nof young birds; and secondly, the spring freshets, which might rise so\r\nhigh as to submerge the nest. These dangers, however, have been\r\nforeseen by the bird. The nest is very deep, and furthermore the edges\r\nof the opening bend inward and form a parapet. In this way is avoided\r\nthe risk of a fall when the reeds that bear the nest are swayed by the\r\nwind. Finally, since the sedge-warbler is at liberty to build her nest\r\nat any desired height above the surface of the pond, she places it\r\nalways high enough to be beyond the reach of the rising water, even in\r\ngreat floods. One suspects the bird of being able to foresee, months in\r\nadvance, the coming inundation; for she builds her nest at a greater or\r\nless elevation according to the high-water mark destined later to be\r\nreached by the surface of the pond.\r\n\r\n“The cisticola is a small warbler very common in the marshes of\r\nCamargue, at the mouth of the Rhone. Its nest is placed in the middle\r\nof a cluster of grass and rushes, and takes the form of a purse with a\r\nsmall round opening. Fine dry leaves form the bed on which the eggs\r\nrest, while other and larger leaves are fixed all around it to form an\r\nenclosure.\r\n\r\n“For this work the bird turns tailor, cutting the leaves and lapping\r\nthem over one another. Along the border of each leaf it punches holes\r\nwith the point of its beak and through these holes it passes one or\r\nmore threads made of cobwebs and the down from certain plants. Its\r\ndistaff for holding the thread—namely, the beak—does not admit of using\r\nvery long strands; hence the needleful, so to speak, goes only twice\r\nor, at most, three times from one leaf to the next one. But no matter;\r\nthe sewing is strong enough to fasten the whole into a sort of purse\r\nwhich keeps out the rain.\r\n\r\n“The orthotomus, or grass-warbler, a small bird of India, is an even\r\nmore skilful tailor, and in fact is commonly known as the tailor-bird.\r\nIt selects two large leaves, still living and attached to the branch on\r\nwhich they grew. These are brought together, with their longer edges\r\ntouching, and are sewed border to border with strong cotton thread made\r\nby the bird’s beak. The seams run only half the length of the leaves,\r\nin such a manner that the two together, hanging down as they do, form a\r\nconical sac with its mouth upward. In this sac the nest is placed,\r\nhidden by its protecting envelope, which so blends with the rest of the\r\nfoliage that even after a person has once found the nest he can with\r\ndifficulty find it again.\r\n\r\n“In South Africa there is a bird scarcely larger than our swallow and\r\nknown as the social republican from its living in large societies with\r\none nest in common. This nest, a sort of bird village, is shaped like\r\nan enormous mushroom, spreading out all around the trunk of a tree,\r\nwhich serves as its stalk, while the lower branches also furnish their\r\nsupport. This colossal edifice is of such bulk and weight as to make a\r\nwagon-load, and if one wishes to see the interior structure it must be\r\nchopped to pieces with an axe. It is formed wholly of dry grass\r\narranged much like the thatch on our rustic roofs.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, this structure, built at public expense by all the associated\r\nbirds, is nothing but a roof, a dome, destined to shelter the real\r\nnests, which are attached to the inside of the thatched covering. Here\r\nare to be found a multitude of round holes presenting all together\r\nsomewhat the appearance of a honeycomb. Each hole gives access to a\r\nsmall cell, a veritable nest and the separate work of a single pair.\r\nThe grass roof, then, is built in common by the whole society, after\r\nwhich each family provides for its exclusive use a little apartment\r\nattached to the lower side of the roof. The number of inhabitants may\r\nreach as high as a thousand.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII\r\n\r\nMIGRATION OF BIRDS\r\n\r\n\r\n“At the approach of the cold season,” Uncle Paul resumed, in his\r\naccount of bird habits and bird peculiarities, “before winter clears\r\nthe fields of insects, covers the ponds with a coating of ice, and\r\nwhitens the landscape with snow, thus cutting off the food-supply\r\nhitherto obtainable from the earth, many birds, especially those that\r\nlive on insects or frequent bodies of water and marshy meadows, take\r\nleave of their native land and direct their course southward, where\r\nthey will find a warmer sun and a more assured supply of food.\r\n\r\n“They take their departure, some in large flocks, others in small\r\ngroups, or even each one separately. With no guide other than an\r\nirresistible impulse too mysterious for us to explain, they traverse by\r\nsuccessive stages immense tracts of land, cross seas, and bend their\r\ncourse toward the countries of the south. Africa is the rendezvous of\r\nour birds and of European birds in general.\r\n\r\n“After the cold season has passed, with the first fine days of spring\r\nthe same birds return to the regions where they were born, making the\r\njourney this time in the opposite direction, from south to north. They\r\ntake possession once more of their groves and forests, their rocks and\r\nprairies, which they know how to find with an inconceivable accuracy.\r\nThere they build their nests, rear their young, and gain strength for\r\nthe coming journey; and upon the return of cold weather they go back\r\nagain to the lands of sunshine.\r\n\r\n“These periodical journeys are called migrations, of which there are\r\ntwo each year,—that of autumn, when the birds leave us and go\r\nsouthward, and that of spring, when they fly northward and come back to\r\nus. These semi-annual flittings take place all over the earth.\r\n\r\n“The various species do not all fix upon the same time for their\r\nmigration, but each has its own calendar, from which it departs only\r\nvery slightly. Some start well in advance of the increasing chill and\r\nthe lessening abundance of food, while others do not leave their native\r\nland until driven by actual necessity, when the cold has become severe.\r\nThus our martin flies away for Africa as early as the month of August,\r\nwhereas the chimney-swallow lingers until October or even November.\r\n\r\n“The martins forsake our turrets and old walls, our steeples and\r\nbelfries, while the summer heat is still intense and the small flies on\r\nwhich they feed are still abundant. It is not, then, any lowering of\r\ntemperature that drives them away, nor is it any lack of food that\r\nhastens their departure; but they have a secret presentiment of the\r\nchange of season that is coming in a few weeks; a deep-seated unrest,\r\nwhich they cannot overcome, warns them that the hour for their\r\ndeparture is drawing near.\r\n\r\n“If one desires to witness this anxiety that torments the bird when the\r\ntime for migrating arrives, he may do so by rearing in captivity a\r\nmigratory bird caught very young. The captive, though never having\r\nlived with its kind or had any knowledge of their migratory habits, and\r\nfurthermore having been kept in a cage with no experience of cold or\r\nhunger, nevertheless, when the season for flitting arrives, shows\r\nagitation and mental distress, and tries to escape from its\r\nprison—after remaining so quiet and contented up to that time. Some\r\ninner voice—instinct we call it—says it is time to go, and the captive\r\nis eager to be off. If the desire is thwarted, death follows.\r\n\r\n“To tear oneself from beloved haunts to incur the fatigues and perils\r\nof a long journey is undoubtedly a painful decision; yet the bird\r\ncourageously submits to the inevitable, but in the hope of coming back\r\nagain some day. The strong reassuring the weak, the older ones guiding\r\nthe young, the departing flock forms itself into a caravan and takes\r\nwing for the south. The sea is crossed, the treacherous sea from which,\r\nat long intervals, rises an island as halting-place. Many perish in the\r\ncrossing, many reach the goal worn with hunger and spent with fatigue.\r\n\r\n“The day for starting on this momentous journey is decided upon in a\r\ngreat assembly, toward the end of August for the window-swallow, and\r\nconsiderably later, even as late as November, for the chimney-swallow.\r\nWhen once the date has been fixed, the window-swallows gather together\r\ndaily for several days on the roofs of tall buildings. Every few\r\nminutes small parties detach themselves from the general conclave and\r\ncircle about in the air with anxious cries, taking a parting look at\r\ntheir native haunts, and paying them a last farewell. Then they return\r\nto their places among their companions and join in noisy chatter on the\r\nsubject of their hopes and fears, all the while preparing themselves\r\nfor the distant expedition by a careful inspection of their plumage and\r\na final touch to one lustrous feather after another.\r\n\r\n“After several repetitions of these farewells a plaintive twittering\r\nannounces the fateful hour. The moment has come, it is time to start.\r\nThe flock rises, the emigrants are off for the south. If one of them\r\nhas been marked with a red string around the claw in order to be\r\nrecognized, you may be sure you will see it come back the next spring\r\nand take possession of its nest again with little cries of joy at\r\nfinding it intact and ready for occupancy after a few repairs.\r\n\r\n“With their vigorous wings the duck and goose, in their wild state, are\r\nardent travelers. On a gray day in November, when there are signs of\r\nsnow, it is not unusual to see passing from north to south, at a great\r\nheight, birds arranged in single file, or in a double file meeting in a\r\npoint, like the two branches of the letter V. These birds are a flock\r\nof either ducks or geese in the act of migrating.\r\n\r\n“If the flock is of no great size, the birds composing it arrange\r\nthemselves in one continuous file, the beak of each following bird\r\ntouching the tail of the preceding, in order that the passage opened\r\nthrough the air may not have time to close again. But if the flock is a\r\nlarge one, two files of equal length are formed, which meet at an acute\r\nangle, the front of the moving mass.\r\n\r\n“This angular arrangement, of which we find examples in the ship’s\r\nprow, the plowshare, the thin edge of a wedge, and a multitude of\r\nutensils designed for cleavage, is the most favorable for pushing\r\nthrough the mass of the air with the least fatigue. If in marshaling\r\ntheir flying battalions the goose and the duck had taken counsel of the\r\nengineer’s science, they could not have managed better. But they have\r\nno need of others’ advice: instructed by their own instinct, they\r\nutilized long before we did the principle of the wedge.\r\n\r\n“Moreover, to divide among all the members of the flock the excess of\r\nfatigue incurred by the file-leader in opening a passage through the\r\nair by strength of wing, each in turn takes the post of honor, the\r\nforward end of the single file or the point of the angle formed by the\r\ndouble file. Its term of service ended, the bird at the head retires to\r\nthe rear to recuperate, and another leader takes its place. By this\r\nequitable division of labor the fatigue does not prove excessive for\r\nany one bird, and the flock leaves no stragglers behind.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII\r\n\r\nCARRIER-PIGEONS\r\n\r\n\r\nResuming the subject of bird instinct as illustrated by the migratory\r\nflock’s unerring precision in finding its way over thousands of miles\r\nto a desired nesting-place, Uncle Paul continued as follows:\r\n\r\n“How is it that so many thousands, even millions, of migrating birds\r\ncan direct their course through trackless space each to the particular\r\nrock or tree or nest left behind six months before, when the yearly\r\nremoval was decided upon to some southern region a thousand miles or\r\nmore distant? How, for example, does the frail swallow manage to find\r\nagain, at the return of spring, its tiny abode in the north when it\r\nretraces the long journey of the previous autumn? In order that we may\r\nbe sure it is the same swallow returned to the same nest we tie a\r\ncolored string, as I have said, around the bird’s claw; and, lo and\r\nbehold, when April comes, with it comes our swallow to its dwelling\r\nunder the eaves. It is indeed our identical bird and no other; it is\r\nthe very one that fashioned the nest of clay, cherished bit of private\r\nproperty now so eagerly taken possession of once more. The owner’s\r\ndemonstrations of satisfaction and delight are convincing proof, even\r\nwere the bit of red thread not there to dispel all doubt.\r\n\r\n“If the swallow is able to find its nest again upon returning in the\r\nspring from the land of the negroes, still more will it be able to find\r\nit after being removed merely from its native canton to the neighboring\r\none.\r\n\r\n“A mother sitting on her eggs or feeding her young is taken, let us\r\nsuppose, put into a basket, and carried quickly to a spot twenty or\r\nthirty leagues distant, where she is set free again. The surrounding\r\ncountry is unfamiliar to her: she has never been there before. Of the\r\nroad over which she has just come she has not the slightest knowledge,\r\nhaving traveled it in the darkness of a closed basket. No matter. With\r\nonly a moment’s hesitation she gets her bearings amid these strange\r\nscenes and takes flight toward her nest as unerringly as if it were\r\npossible to see the very roof under which repose her little ones. In a\r\nfew hours we shall find her back again on her nest.\r\n\r\n“A like behavior under similar conditions might be witnessed in the\r\ncase of divers other birds noted for strength of wing and power of\r\nsustained flight. They would return to their domicile in spite of the\r\ndistance to be traversed and the unfamiliarity of the intervening\r\ncountry. Maternal love can accomplish wonders. In order to save her\r\neggs from a chill or her little ones from starving in her absence, the\r\nmother-bird exercises a geographical skill as marvelous as that\r\ndisplayed at the period of migration.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard it said,” remarked Louis, “that the pigeon is very clever\r\nat finding its way over long distances, and that it is used for\r\ncarrying letters from one place to another.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” replied Uncle Paul, “this aptitude for retracing the homeward\r\nway over vast distances is shown to an extraordinary degree by some of\r\nour domestic pigeons. Economizing all their strength for purposes of\r\nsustained flight, they have retained the wild pigeon’s pointed wings,\r\nsleek plumage, and symmetrical form. We call these birds\r\ncarrier-pigeons, a name well earned, as you will see from what I have\r\nnow to tell you.\r\n\r\n“A pigeon having a brood of young is taken from the pigeon-house, put\r\ninto a closed basket, and transported a distance of a hundred, two\r\nhundred leagues, or even further if you choose—from one end of France\r\nto the other. There it is set free. It rises in the air, circles about\r\na few times as if to assure itself of the direction to be followed, and\r\nthen starts off in impetuous flight toward the quarter where\r\npigeon-house and young await its coming.\r\n\r\n“Does the bird catch sight of the pigeon-house as it circles about in\r\nthe upper air? By no means; the distance is too great. Even should it\r\nrise to the height of the clouds, or to still greater altitudes, where\r\nmoreover its wings could not sustain it, it would be unable to see its\r\nhome. On the journey to the point where it was released it has had no\r\npassing glimpse of any object, shut up as it has been in the dark\r\nbasket. The region it now traverses it sees for the first time. Nothing\r\nin the surrounding landscape is familiar, and yet its flight evinces\r\nthe assurance that comes from having a definite goal in view. With a\r\nspeed of about twenty leagues an hour it wings its way straight to the\r\njourney’s end. If the distance is too great to be covered without\r\npause, halts are made here and there for food and rest; then the\r\njourney is resumed, swift as an arrow’s flight. Finally, at the end of\r\nsome hours or days, according to the distance and the duration of the\r\nhalts, the bird reënters the pigeon-house with its beakful of food for\r\nthe waiting little ones.\r\n\r\n“In serious situations the carrier-pigeon is a valuable messenger.\r\nDuring the winter of that terrible year, 1870–71, when the German\r\nhordes besieged Paris, no communication was possible by ordinary means\r\nbetween the invested city and the rest of France, in arms to repel the\r\nodious invader. With Paris rendered mute by its isolation, one might\r\nhave said that the heart of the country had ceased to beat. For\r\ncommunication between those within and friends without, recourse was\r\nhad to balloons and pigeons.\r\n\r\n“Certain persons of dauntless courage left Paris by balloon, choosing\r\nespecially the night-time for their departure in order to avoid\r\nencounter by day. They carried with them despatches from Paris and a\r\nnumber of carrier-pigeons. Over the enemy camps they went, to alight\r\nsomewhere, far or near, at the pleasure of the winds. Thus the\r\nprovinces received despatches, newspapers, and private letters from\r\nParis. The car of the balloon was loaded with all these.\r\n\r\n“But how carry back to Paris despatches from the provinces? To leave a\r\ncity by balloon in any chance direction is not so very difficult; but\r\nto return by balloon to the same city is practically impossible. The\r\nballoon goes as the wind wills, not as its passengers would like to\r\nhave it go. To seek to return by the means employed in departing would\r\nbe to compromise everything by incurring the risk of landing in the\r\nmidst of the Prussian lines.\r\n\r\n“The only remaining expedient was to use those incomparable aids, the\r\npigeons, which the aëronaut had taken with him on his departure.\r\nReleased, one at a time, with despatches enclosed in a quill and\r\nfastened to the bird’s tail, they flew back over the German army to the\r\npigeon-house; they reëntered Paris and brought news of what was going\r\non in the provinces.\r\n\r\n“Do not imagine that the winged messenger was able to transmit only a\r\nfew words or at most a few lines. It was not with a pen or on ordinary\r\npaper that the despatches entrusted to the pigeons were written. By\r\ningenious methods and with unheard-of delicacy it was found possible to\r\nobtain characters so fine and sheets of paper so thin that a roll of\r\nthese sheets weighing scarcely a gram and enclosed in a quill contained\r\nas much reading matter as ten printed volumes. What a marvelous piece\r\nof work, that package of letters fastened to the pigeon’s tail, that\r\nquill transformed into a library in which thousands of persons—friends,\r\nkinsfolk, statesmen—communicated their projects, their fears, their\r\nhopes! In this manner the mail service was maintained during those\r\nwoeful times.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX\r\n\r\nSOME PREHISTORIC ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Fossil remains of all sorts of animals, from the largest to the\r\nsmallest, are found embedded in stone. There are lizards which, if\r\nalive, would hardly find room enough to turn around in many of our\r\npublic squares, so monstrous is their size; tortoises with shell as\r\nlarge as a small boat; fishes of strange formation; birds of a singular\r\ncharacter such as we no longer behold; and enormous quadrupeds that\r\nwould dwarf to insignificance our sturdy ox. All flying creatures of\r\nthe air, all walking and creeping animals of the earth, every form of\r\nlife swimming in the water, are represented in these fossil remains\r\nfound in the heart of our rocks, but of a shape and often of a size\r\nvery different from those of our living animals.\r\n\r\n“These ancient creatures have never been seen alive by man, so far back\r\nin the past is their period. After inhabiting the earth for a very long\r\ntime, they disappeared forever, to give place to other species. What\r\nremains of them consists chiefly of bones, which from their hardness\r\nand their mineral character offer the most resistance to the various\r\ndestructive agencies. With the sole aid of these bones science succeeds\r\nin reconstructing the exact form of the animal. It also tells us what\r\nthe animal fed on and what were its habits. By a miracle of sagacity it\r\nresuscitates, so to speak, the ancient, dislocated carcass, and makes\r\nit live again to the mind’s eye.\r\n\r\n“Fossil bones are commonly found embedded in stone quarried at\r\nconsiderable depths; it needs the work of pick and chisel and hammer to\r\nfree them from the rock. How did they come to be there? In the same way\r\nas shells. If the creature lived in the waters of a lake or of the sea,\r\nthe mud at the bottom covered the body after death. If it lived on\r\nland, the floods swept away its carcass and bore it to the river, which\r\nin turn carried it to lake or ocean. Later the lake dried up or the\r\nocean receded, and the hardened clay left behind became the stone\r\nwhence to-day are obtained the relics of prehistoric forms of animal\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n“What, then, were these prehistoric forms of animal life that preceded\r\nman? Regarding ourselves as related to the animals provided with bones,\r\na sort of inner framework sustaining the corporeal edifice, we may say\r\nin a general way that there has been a gradual succession from lower to\r\nhigher in structure. First appeared the fishes, then came the reptiles,\r\nnext the birds, after them the quadrupeds, suckling their young, and\r\nlast of all man, placed above all the rest by his incomparable\r\nendowments.\r\n\r\n“Let us glance rapidly at some examples of the ancient denizens of land\r\nand sea. Look at this picture. The back of the creature here\r\nrepresented resembles a little, in its form and in its regular rows of\r\nscales, the tail of a fish; but the front—to what can that be likened?\r\nWhat is the meaning of those large bony plaques arranged side by side\r\nlike the squares in a tessellated pavement? The animal is armed with\r\ncoat of mail, perhaps to protect itself from the bite of an enemy.\r\n\r\n“What is the purpose of those wing-like appendages that strike the\r\nflanks? Of what use are those two short horns at the base of the\r\nforehead? What sort of a creature can it be that thus singularly\r\ncombines in its structure the tail of a fish, the shell of a tortoise,\r\nthe featherless wings of a bird, and the nascent horns of a ram? You\r\nwill never guess the answer, so different is the creature from any that\r\nare known to you. It is a fish, but such a fish as no frying-pan of\r\nours has ever had acquaintance with, nor does the ocean now hold any\r\nmore like it.\r\n\r\n“It goes back to the earliest ages of the world, and is called the\r\npterichthys. Do not exclaim at this name, as strange to our ears as the\r\ncreature itself to our eyes. Translated into our tongue, it means a\r\nwinged fish. But did this fish of former ages really fly? Assuredly\r\nnot. It was too heavy, too massive, to admit of that. Its wings were\r\nsimply admirable fins for swimming.\r\n\r\n“In the seas of our day there live certain fishes fitted for flying.\r\nTheir lateral fins, which are very long, open like large fans and\r\nenable them to sustain themselves for some time in the air. Pressed too\r\nhard by a pursuing foe, they escape by leaping out of the water and\r\nflying over the waves, clearing a certain distance before plunging\r\nagain into the water, as they must when their fins begin to get dry and\r\nto lose their suppleness. They are called flying fishes. Compare these\r\ntwo pictures and you will see how greatly the present flying fish\r\ndiffers from the ancient winged fish.\r\n\r\n“And this other creature—what wild dream could have conceived such a\r\nmonstrosity? It has the head and neck of a plucked bird; and it also\r\nhas a bird’s beak, but an enormous one armed with pointed teeth in each\r\nmandible. Its wings are those of a bat, one talon of each claw being\r\ndisproportionately elongated and serving as support to a wide membrane,\r\nmuch as an umbrella-rib holds the stretched fabric of the cover. Its\r\nother talons are free and are furnished with hooked nails.\r\n\r\n“The hind legs and feet are those of the lizard. The body is covered\r\nwith fine scales, is marbled with touches of a darker color, and ends\r\nin an abbreviated tail. Take away from this strange animal its bat’s\r\nwings, its long neck and its bird’s head, and you will have something\r\nclosely resembling the lizard, the creature that basks in the sun on\r\nold walls, or that other one, larger and all green, which gives us a\r\nstart when it scuttles away among the dead leaves or in the dense\r\ngrowth of the hedge.”\r\n\r\n“And was it a lizard, then, or a bird?” asked Emile.\r\n\r\n“It was a reptile, certainly,” was the reply, “and it might be called a\r\nsort of lizard. There were several species, varying from the size of a\r\nlark to that of a crow. Like the bat, the animal left its retreat in\r\nthe hollow of rocks and came out at night to flutter awkwardly about in\r\nthe air by the aid of its wings of stretched skin. With its toothed\r\nbeak it snapped up in their flight immense dragon-flies, the chief\r\ninsects of that time. Its hunger appeased, it took its repose on the\r\nground, wings folded against its sides, body supported by the hind\r\nlegs; or else it hung down from the rocks, suspended by its claws. Its\r\nname is pterodactyl, which means wing-fingered.\r\n\r\n“Let us consider another of these prehistoric creatures. This time it\r\nis a bird, and what a marvelous bird, too, my friends! Its beak, no\r\nless monstrous than that of the pterodactyl, had likewise the two\r\nmandibles armed with a ferocious-looking set of teeth. Pointed teeth in\r\nthe jaws of a reptile, such as a lizard, crocodile, or serpent, are\r\nnothing extraordinary; but in a bird’s mouth, that is unheard-of.\r\nTo-day one would search in vain all over the earth for anything like\r\nit. There are beaks of all shapes and sizes, there are short ones and\r\nlong ones, straight ones and crooked ones, strong ones and weak ones;\r\nbut all are toothless, as are the hen’s and the sparrow’s. What a\r\nsingular custom in the primitive bird, to adopt for beak the toothed\r\njaws of the reptile!\r\n\r\n“And that is not all. This bird adopted also the reptile’s tail, but\r\ncovered it with feathers. Birds of the present day have a short, wide\r\nrump, from which grow a dozen coarse feathers. The first bird in the\r\norder of time had its tail composed of a long succession of little\r\nbones, each supporting two feathers. Here is a picture of that tail\r\njust as it was found in the rock where the strange creature left its\r\nremains. The bird to which the tail belonged is called by the learned\r\nan archæopteryx, or ancient winged animal.\r\n\r\n“One more of these monsters, and that will suffice. The animal that you\r\nsee here is the mammoth, a sort of enormous shaggy elephant, so tall\r\nthat its back would have touched the ceiling in most of our great\r\nhalls. Its height was as much as six meters. By its side the ordinary\r\nelephant, the largest of extant terrestrial animals, would look no\r\nlarger than a sheep beside an ox.\r\n\r\n“Its tusks, which had a pronounced backward curve, measured four meters\r\nin length and weighed as much as four hundred and eighty pounds each.\r\nWhat must have been the strength of a colossus carrying between its\r\nlips a weight of nine hundred pounds as easily as a cat carries the\r\nhairs of its mustaches!\r\n\r\n“Man was already in existence at the time of the mammoth. Armed with\r\nsharp flint-stones and bone-pointed arrows, he made bold to attack the\r\nenormous animal whose weight made the earth tremble. He hunted it in\r\nthe chase and feasted on its flesh. What a piece of game when the giant\r\nfell into the deep ditch masked by a light covering of boughs and\r\nfoliage! The victim was then overwhelmed with masses of rock, after\r\nwhich there was an interminable banquet for the whole tribe.\r\n\r\n“Let us go no further, but merely say in conclusion that the animals of\r\nto-day are not the same as those of former ages. Long before the\r\npresent species on land and in the sea, there gradually made their\r\nappearance other very different forms of animal life, which have now\r\nbecome extinct. Nowhere on the earth are there now living any creatures\r\nlike those that have left their fossil remains for our inspection.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX\r\n\r\nTHE ORIGIN OF COAL\r\n\r\n\r\n“Coal is a fuel of inestimable value. By the heat which it develops in\r\nburning it gives movement to divers machines. It makes the locomotive\r\nmove over the iron rails and the steamship traverse the ocean. With its\r\naid metals are worked, fabrics woven, pottery is baked, glassware\r\nmanufactured, newspapers and books are printed, tools are shaped, and\r\nall sorts of instruments necessary to our daily activities are\r\nproduced. The arts and crafts have no more powerful auxiliary. If we\r\nhad to substitute the heat of wood for that of coal, our forests would\r\nprove insufficient.\r\n\r\n“What, then, is the origin of this combustible, which feeds an immense\r\nindustry and is the source of incalculable riches? Ordinarily a piece\r\nof coal has no great interest for the eye. It is black, lustrous,\r\nformless, friable, without any definite character to afford us\r\ninstruction. One can learn more from the fragments of refuse rejected\r\nby the miner as too poor in carbon, fragments in which the\r\npredominating element is a kind of dark stone that splits in sheets. In\r\nthese a surprise is lurking that will tell us the secret of coal.\r\n\r\n“These laminate blocks, stone rather than coal, show us, on the slabs\r\nthat have just been separated by the blow of the hammer, various\r\nwonderful designs in which we recognize without hesitation the imprint\r\nor mold of some form of vegetation. There is no mistake about it; a\r\nplant has left its remains there; we behold in very truth the leaf with\r\nits subdivisions and its veins. It is all there, even to the minutest\r\ndetail. It is really the leaf minus the green color, for which is\r\nsubstituted the black of the coal. We should not obtain a more exact\r\nrepresentation if we ourselves took the imprint of some sufficiently\r\nfirm leaf on a soft plaque of clay.\r\n\r\n“Pending the time when some lucky chance shall bring you into the\r\nneighborhood of a coal mine where you can obtain a laminate block that\r\nyou can split into sheets and thus discover for yourselves the\r\nvegetable imprints there concealed, here is a picture that will show\r\nyou what these curious markings look like.\r\n\r\n“What do you think of it? Have we not here what seems to be actual\r\nleaves, and very elegant ones too? They are spread out with a care that\r\nwould appear to indicate the work of a painstaking human hand. Yes,\r\nthese are real leaves, but turned to carbon and firmly incrusted in\r\ntheir bed of black rock.\r\n\r\n“Similar imprints are found in great abundance in all coal mines.\r\nCertain coal-deposits, several meters thick, are composed entirely of\r\nthem, the smallest chip that one splits off bearing on each face the\r\nmarkings of foliage. The whole is nothing but an accumulation of leaves\r\nand broken tree-trunks. An entire forest, heaped up in one pile, would\r\nnot present an equal mass. Thus it is demonstrated that in coal are\r\npreserved the remains of ancient vegetation.\r\n\r\n“During great floods the rivers of former ages swept away in enormous\r\nmasses the trees they had uprooted along the banks, together with the\r\nfoliage washed into the current by the heavy rains; then all this\r\nrefuse was deposited in the mud at the river’s mouth, or in some lake\r\nor bay. Thus were amassed here and there, under the water, during a\r\nlong series of centuries, the remains of primitive forests.\r\n\r\n“Fine clay became packed about these masses, molding itself with\r\ndelicate accuracy around even the smallest leaf; the weight of the\r\nsuperimposed mud crushed the softened tree-trunks; a gradual decay\r\nconverted the whole into charcoal; and finally the ligneous mass became\r\na layer of coal. Later the waters changed their bed, driven elsewhere\r\nby upheavals in the surface of the earth, and the previously inundated\r\nbottom-lands became solid ground in which to-day we find coal under\r\nmassive strata of rock.\r\n\r\n“Is it possible to distinguish the forms of plant-life whence has come\r\nour coal? Yes, it is possible, so well preserved are the details of\r\nthat life in the products of our mines. Now an examination of the\r\nimprints left to us in the laminæ or leaves of our stone book shows us\r\nthat the plant-life of those remote ages in which the coal was\r\naccumulated bore not the least resemblance to that of our present\r\nforests. And this difference was to be expected. The animal life has\r\nchanged; why, then, should the plant-life have remained unaltered?”\r\n\r\n“Didn’t they have trees then like ours?” asked Jules.\r\n\r\n“No,” replied his uncle; “we do not find in our coal mines any signs of\r\nthe existence of trees resembling those of our day. Nowhere in the\r\nworld, in fact, are there now to be seen any such forms of plant-life\r\nas flourished so abundantly in those remote ages; or if any still exist\r\nthat are at all analogous, they must be sought in the islands of the\r\ntropical seas. No vegetable growth of that coal epoch, whether tree or\r\nbush or simple cluster of leaves, bore flowers. The splendors of the\r\ncorolla were not to appear until a later period.\r\n\r\n“For the most part there were only tall stems or stalks, without\r\nbranches, of equal size from top to bottom, and furrowed with channels\r\nor dotted with large points arranged in spiral lines. At the top a tuft\r\nof enormous leaves balanced itself, the under surface of each leaf\r\nbearing elongated or rounded swellings containing a fine brown dust,\r\neach grain of which was a seed for the propagation of the plant.\r\n\r\n“Plants that thus bear their seeds, or spores, in powdery masses on the\r\nunder side of the leaves are called ferns. A number of species flourish\r\nin our part of the world. They are unpretentious plants, fond of shade\r\nand coolness. Old damp walls, rocks that drip water drop by drop, the\r\ndarkest corners of our woods—these are the customary haunts of the\r\nfern.\r\n\r\n“A short underground stock and a sparse cluster of leaves, very\r\nelegantly shaped, it is true, constitute our native ferns. Those of the\r\ncoal epoch were of a different pattern. Some of them displayed at the\r\ntop of a stem as tall as our poplars a cluster of leaves five or six\r\nmeters in length. They are called tree-ferns, and they contributed the\r\ngreater part of the coal-forming material.\r\n\r\n“The accompanying illustration will give you an idea of what the\r\nvegetation of that period must have looked like. What strange trees!\r\nHow different from our oaks and maples and hemlocks! The soil is a\r\nliquid mud in which lie and rot the tree-trunks prostrated by the\r\nweight of years; the air is sultry, moist, heavy, strongly impregnated\r\nwith a moldy smell; and the density of the foliage barely admits a few\r\nsunbeams to flicker over the surface of the stagnant pools.\r\n\r\n“Everywhere profound silence. No song of bird bursts forth from the\r\nfoliage of those tall fern-trees, for the bird is not yet in existence.\r\nNo foot of quadruped treads the ground, for the quadruped with its coat\r\nof fur will not come until much later. Some lizards lurking in the\r\nrock-fissures, some large dragon-flies at the water’s edge, some odious\r\nscorpions under the heaps of dead leaves—that is all the animal-life to\r\nbe found in the forests that gave us our coal.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXI\r\n\r\nTHE FARMER’S HELPERS\r\n\r\n\r\n“By ‘helpers’ I here mean those animals and birds that come to our aid,\r\nthough not subject to our care and protection, and make war on the\r\ninsects and divers other devourers that would soon get complete control\r\nof our crops if we were left to our own resources for preventing their\r\nexcessive multiplication. What could man do against those voracious\r\nhordes that annually propagate their kind at a rate defying\r\ncalculation? Would he have the patience, the skill, the keenness of\r\neyesight necessary for effective warfare upon the smallest of these\r\nmarauders when the June-bug, despite its size, mocks at our utmost\r\nefforts to exterminate it? Would he undertake to examine all his\r\nfields, a clod at a time, to inspect his grain, ear by ear, to\r\nscrutinize his fruit trees, one leaf after another? For so prodigious a\r\ntask the combined efforts of the whole human race would not suffice.\r\nThe devouring hosts would eat us up, my friends, if we had no helpers\r\nto come to our rescue, helpers endowed with a patience that nothing can\r\nweary, an adroitness that baffles all wiles, a vigilance from which\r\nthere is no escape. To lie in wait for the enemy, to seek him in his\r\nremotest retreats, to pursue him without pause or rest, and finally to\r\nexterminate him, that is their sole concern, their incessant\r\npreoccupation. They are implacable, pitiless; hunger urges them on,\r\nboth for their own sake and in behalf of their families. They live at\r\nthe expense of those that live at our expense; they are the enemies of\r\nour enemies.\r\n\r\n“As participants in this great work must be named the bat and the\r\nhedge-hog, the owl, the martin, the swallow, and all the smaller birds,\r\nthe lizard, the adder, the frog, and the toad. Praise be to God who has\r\ngiven us as protectors from that glutton, the insect, such birds as the\r\nswallow and the warbler, the robin and the nightingale, the martin and\r\nthe starling. And yet these invaluable creatures, guardians of earth’s\r\nbounty, a delight to the eye, a solace to the ear, have their homes\r\npillaged by the barbarous and stupid robber of birds’ nests. Praise be\r\nto God who for the protection of our daily bread has given us the owl\r\nand the toad, the hedge-hog and the bat, the adder, the lizard and the\r\nmole. Nevertheless these useful creatures that come so valiantly to our\r\naid are cursed and calumniated, and we stupidly vent upon them our\r\nloathing and hate.\r\n\r\n“By what perversity are we, in general, impelled to destroy animals\r\nwhose coöperation is so much to our advantage? Nearly all our helpers\r\nare persecuted. Their good will must be indomitable to make them bear\r\nour ill treatment and not forsake our dwellings and fields, never to\r\nreturn. The bat rids us of a host of enemies, and is nevertheless under\r\nthe ban; the mole clears the soil of vermin, and is likewise\r\nproscribed; the hedge-hog wages war on vipers and cut-worms, and it too\r\nis an outlaw; the owl and various other night birds are accomplished\r\nrat-hunters, and they also are in disfavor; the adder, toad, and lizard\r\nfeed on the ravagers of our crops, and all the while we hold them in\r\nabhorrence. They are ugly, we say, and without further reason we kill\r\nthem. But, blind slayers, the day will come when you will perceive that\r\nyou have been sacrificing your own defenders to an irrational\r\nrepugnance. You complain of rats, but you nail the owl to your door and\r\nlet its body dry in the sun as a hideous trophy; you cry out against\r\ncut-worms, but you crush the mole every time your spade turns one up;\r\nyou disembowel the hedge-hog and set your dogs on him just for fun; you\r\nbewail the ravages of moth and worm in your granaries, but if the bat\r\nfalls into your clutches it is seldom that you show him any mercy. Your\r\ncomplaints go up to heaven, but all these willing helpers of yours you\r\ntreat as creatures accursed. Blind fools that you are, filled with an\r\ninsane desire to kill!\r\n\r\n“Insect-eating birds are of immense importance to agriculture. They\r\ndivide among themselves the work to be done in field and hedge, meadow\r\nand garden, forest and orchard, and wage unceasing warfare on every\r\nspecies of vermin, a terrible tribe that would destroy our crops were\r\nnot more vigilant guardians than we continually on the watch—guardians\r\nof far greater adroitness, of sharper eyesight, of more lasting\r\npatience in their endless quest, and having nothing else to do. I am\r\nnot exaggerating, my little friends; without insect-eating birds famine\r\nwould decimate us. Who then, unless he be an idiot with a mania for\r\ndestruction, would dare touch the nests of birds that enliven the\r\ncountry with their plumage and deliver us from the devouring scourge of\r\ninsects? But there are, nevertheless, bloodthirsty gamins who, if they\r\ncan manage to elude the school-master and play truant, find it a joyous\r\npastime to climb trees and explore hedges in order to rob birds’ nests\r\nand slaughter the young. These good-for-nothings are under the\r\nsurveillance of the rural guard and liable to the utmost rigors of the\r\nlaw, to the end that our crops may still be protected by the birds and\r\nthat our fields and orchards may continue to yield sheaves of grain and\r\nbaskets of fruit.\r\n\r\n“Let us add a few words on the mode of life of these indispensable\r\ncollaborators. The bat feeds exclusively on insects, anything in that\r\nclass serving its purpose,—beetles with hard wing-sheaths,\r\nspindle-shanked mosquitoes, graceful butterflies, plump-bellied moths\r\nof all kinds, such as make havoc of our cereals, vineyards, fruit trees\r\nand woolen stuffs, and those that come in the evening, attracted by the\r\nlamplight, and singe their wings over the flame. Who shall say how many\r\ninsects are snapped up by the bats in their nightly tour of our\r\npremises? The game is so small, the hunter’s appetite so insatiable!\r\n\r\n“Note what takes place on a calm summer evening. Lured abroad by the\r\nmild temperature of the twilight hours, a swarm of insects leave their\r\nretreats and come out to play in the open air, to hunt for food, and to\r\nmate, one with another. It is then that great night-moths fly abruptly\r\nfrom flower to flower and plunge their long proboscis to the bottom of\r\nthe corolla, where they suck up the honey; it is then that the\r\nmosquito, eager for human blood, sings its war-song in our ears and\r\nchooses our tenderest spot for the insertion of its envenomed lancet;\r\nand it is then that the June-bug quits the sheltering leaf, spreads its\r\nresounding wings, and goes booming through the air in quest of its kin.\r\nThe gnats dance in joyous swarms which the least puff of wind disperses\r\nlike a column of smoke; the moths, their wings powdered with silver\r\ndust and their antennæ displayed plume-fashion, indulge in frolicsome\r\ngambols or go in search of favorable places for laying their eggs; the\r\nlittle wood-gnawing beetles explore the wrinkled bark of old\r\ntree-trunks; the wheat-moths rise in clouds from the ravaged grain and\r\ntake flight for fresh fields; and other night-flying insects flutter\r\nabout, alighting on grape-vines and fruit-trees, all busily searching\r\nfor food and shelter for their calamitous offspring.\r\n\r\n“But suddenly this scene of jollity is intruded upon by a most\r\nunwelcome kill-joy. The bat, with zig-zag course, flits hither and\r\nthither, up and down, back and forth, untiring of wing, appearing and\r\ndisappearing, darting its head out this way and that, and each time\r\ncatching an insect in flight, which it immediately crushes and gobbles\r\nup, sending it to its doom down a throat that opens wide from ear to\r\near. It is famous hunting: gnats, beetles, moths, all are there in\r\nplenty, and every once in a while a little cry of joy announces the\r\ncapture of an especially plump victim. As long as the fading twilight\r\nadmits of it, the ardent hunter continues in this way his work of\r\nextermination. Stuffed to repletion at last, the bat regains its dark\r\nand quiet retreat; but on the morrow, and every day thereafter\r\nthroughout the summer, the hunt will be resumed, always with the same\r\nardor, always at the cost of insects only. My children, respect the\r\nbat, our helper in destroying the ravagers of our fields.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII\r\n\r\nTHE FARMER’S HELPERS\r\n\r\n(Continued)\r\n\r\n\r\n“The hedge-hog’s diet consists especially of insects. The lowest order\r\nof vermin is disdained by him as too small, but a June-bug larva or a\r\nfat-bellied cricket is a capital prize, and when these are not too\r\ndeeply buried he burrows with claws and snout to unearth them. All\r\nnight long he goes prowling around, routing out and crunching a goodly\r\nnumber of our enemies, without doing any appreciable harm himself.\r\n\r\n“Listen now to what I am going to relate to you from the book of a\r\nlearned observer. ‘I had in a box,’ he says, ‘a female hedge-hog with\r\nher sucklings; and I added to the occupants of the box a vigorous\r\nviper, which coiled itself up in one corner. The hedge-hog slowly\r\napproached and smelt of the reptile, whereupon the latter raised its\r\nhead and put itself on guard, showing the while its venomous fangs. For\r\na moment the aggressor recoiled, but only to resume the offensive\r\nimmediately after and with no sign of fear. The viper then bit the\r\nanimal on the end of its snout. The hedge-hog licked its bleeding\r\nwound, and in doing so received a second bite on the tongue without\r\nsuffering itself to be at all intimidated. Finally it seized the\r\nserpent by the middle of its body, and the two adversaries rolled\r\ntogether on the floor in a furious struggle, the quadruped grunting and\r\nsnorting, the reptile hissing and making repeated use of its fangs.\r\nSuddenly the hedge-hog seized its antagonist’s head and crunched it\r\nbetween its teeth, after which, without the least sign of perturbation,\r\nit proceeded to devour the forward half of the body. That done, it\r\nreturned to the opposite corner of the box and, lying on its side,\r\ncalmly began to suckle its young. On the morrow it ate the rest of the\r\nviper. The same experiment was several times repeated, with an interval\r\nof some days between each repetition and the next, but the issue was\r\nalways the same: in spite of wounds that set its snout to bleeding, the\r\nhedge-hog invariably finished by devouring the reptile, and neither the\r\nmother nor her young showed any ill effects from the experience.’\r\n\r\n“It is to be assumed that the hedge-hog has not received the gift of\r\nwithstanding the venom of reptiles only to leave that gift unemployed.\r\nThe animal is evidently intended to find its chief pleasure in haunting\r\nthe places frequented by the viper; in its nightly rounds among the\r\nunderbrush it must often catch the lurking serpent and make short work\r\nof the venomous creature. What valuable service it must render in\r\nregions infested by this dangerous reptile! And yet man is the\r\nhedge-hog’s inveterate foe, showering it with maledictions and treating\r\nit as an unclean beast good for nothing except perhaps to arouse the\r\nfury of dogs, which have to beware of its bristling back. Do not, my\r\nchildren, imitate this evil example, but respect the hedge-hog for\r\nridding you of the cut-worm and the viper.\r\n\r\n“Now as to the mole, what does it eat? The best way to decide the\r\nquestion of an animal’s diet is to examine the contents of its stomach.\r\nLet us, then, open the mole’s stomach and see for ourselves. Sometimes\r\nit is found to contain red fragments of the common earth-worm;\r\nsometimes a hash of beetles, recognizable from the tough remains that\r\nhave resisted digestion, such as bits of claws and wing-sheaths;\r\nsometimes, again, and oftener than not, a marmalade of larvæ,\r\nespecially those of the June-bug, with their distinctive signs like the\r\nmandibles and the hard casing of the head. One finds, in short, a\r\nlittle of every sort of game haunting the soil,—polypods and millepeds,\r\ninsects and caterpillars, moths in the chrysalis, underground worms and\r\nnymphs, and so on; but the minutest scrutiny fails to discover a single\r\nparticle of vegetable matter.\r\n\r\n“The mole, then, is exclusively carnivorous, and furthermore it has a\r\nmonstrous appetite, a perfectly insatiable stomach that in twelve hours\r\ndemands a quantity of food equal to the animal’s weight. The mole’s\r\nexistence is one gluttonous frenzy, ever renewing itself, never\r\nappeased; a few hours’ abstinence suffices to kill the creature. To\r\nstill the anguish of that stomach, which is no sooner stuffed with food\r\nthan it is emptied again, what can the animal count upon? On the grubs\r\nliving in the ground, and especially on those of the June-bug, tender\r\nand fat. It is a small creature for supplying the wants of such an\r\nappetite, but its numbers make up for its littleness. What a massacre\r\nof worms, then, must not the mole be credited with in the season when\r\nworms abound! Scarcely is one meal finished before another begins, and\r\nat each repast the worms must be gobbled up by the dozen. To clear a\r\nfield of these formidable ravagers the farmer has no helper equal to\r\nthe mole. The only regret is that to reach the vermin on which the\r\nanimal lives, it has to burrow among the roots where they have their\r\nhaunts. Many roots that lie in the way are necessarily ruptured in this\r\nwork; plants are broken off and destroyed; and, finally, the little\r\npiles of earth, or mole-hills, heaped up by the animal in the course of\r\nits excavations, impede the reaper when harvest-time comes around.\r\nNever mind: the worms would have caused much more serious damage, and\r\nto get rid of them there is nothing like this ravenous insect-hunter.\r\nTherefore, children, never molest the mole, the protector of our crops.\r\n\r\n“The toad is harmless, but that is not enough to commend the creature\r\nto our attention. It too is a helper of great worth, a greedy devourer\r\nof slugs, beetles, larvæ, and every sort of vermin. Discreetly\r\nwithdrawn by day under the cool cover of a stone in some obscure hole,\r\nit leaves its retreat at nightfall to make its regular rounds,\r\npropelling itself, hoppity-hop, on its ample stomach. Here is a slug on\r\nits way to the lettuce-plants; yonder is a cricket chirping at the\r\nentrance to its hole; and over there a June-bug is laying its eggs in\r\nthe ground. Master toad comes along in circumspect fashion, opens his\r\ncavernous mouth, and in three gulps swallows them all with a gurgle of\r\nsatisfaction. Oh, but that was good! Now for some more of the same\r\nsort.\r\n\r\n“He continues on his rounds, and when dawn begins to glimmer in the\r\neast what kind of a hodge-podge of variegated vermin must there not be\r\nin the glutton’s capacious maw? Yet they kill this useful\r\ncreature—stone it to death because, forsooth, it is not so handsome as\r\nit might be. My children, may you never be guilty of such cruelty, such\r\nfoolish and mischievous cruelty! Never stone the toad, for in doing so\r\nyou would be robbing the fields of a vigilant guardian. Let the poor\r\ncreature perform in peace its appointed task as destroyer of worms and\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\n“Finally, and not least of all, must be mentioned the various birds,\r\nchiefly the little birds of our fields and farm-yards, that help the\r\nfarmer by devouring harmful insects and the seeds of wild grasses and\r\nintrusive weeds. These indefatigable assistants, however, we have\r\nalready discussed, and we have gratefully acknowledged our indebtedness\r\nto them. No more, then, need be said about them at present, except in\r\nthe way of renewed admonition never to molest them, never to rob their\r\nnests; for they are our friends and benefactors.”\r\n\r\n\r\n                                FINIS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Laundry starch is now obtained chiefly from rice and from\r\npulse.—Translator.\r\n\r\n[2] The author is not quite accurate here.
