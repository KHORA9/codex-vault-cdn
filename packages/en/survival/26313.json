D., said that for successful farming three things are essential:\r\nknowledge, capital and love for the calling. This statement is just as\r\ntrue today as it was when written 1900 years ago by this early writer\r\non European agriculture.\r\n\r\nEvery man who loves the calling and has an ambition to become a\r\nsuccessful farmer should understand that no two of these essentials\r\nare sufficient, but that all three are necessary. Although this is so\r\nsimple as to be almost axiomatic, it is indeed surprising how few\r\npeople believe a knowledge of farming is really essential to success.\r\n\r\nAmerica is strewn with cases of failure, in farming, by men investing\r\ncapital acquired in other business. In nine cases out of ten failure\r\nhas been due to lack of knowledge of farming.\r\n\r\nThere is known to the writer an expert mineralogist and metallurgist.\r\nOn the subject of coal and gold mining he can give the most valuable\r\ninformation. His advice is constantly sought on all such matters.\r\nInstead of investing his money in mining, on which he is a recognized\r\nauthority, he has invested it in a farm, about which he knows next to\r\nnothing. He has not even had the advantage of being raised on a farm,\r\nsince his father was a railroad man.\r\n\r\nA mechanical engineer remarked that if he had $25,000 he would invest\r\nit in a farm. This man is supposed to be an expert in business methods\r\nas applied to manufacturing in general, and he is especially\r\nconversant with the manufacture and trade in automobiles. About all he\r\nhas seen of farming he has observed from the window of a Pullman car\r\nor from the steering wheel of an automobile. Instead of investing his\r\nearnings in some manufacturing business, about which he has spent\r\nyears of study and in which he has had some training, he would invest\r\nit in farming, of which he has only the most rudimentary knowledge, if\r\nonly he had sufficient capital. As a matter of fact, he is more in\r\nneed of knowledge than of capital.\r\n\r\nEven farmers of experience do not always realize the training required\r\nto succeed in farming. A letter was received by the dean of a certain\r\nagricultural college saying that a graduate of another agricultural\r\ncollege had taken one of the poorest farms in his neighborhood and was\r\nraising better potatoes than anyone else could raise. The letter asked\r\nthat information be sent by return mail as to how this young man could\r\nbe beaten in raising potatoes. Of course the answer had to be sent\r\nthat while information upon raising potatoes could easily be supplied,\r\nalthough not in the limits of an ordinary letter, the training in\r\nobservation, judgment and reasoning faculties essential to meet the\r\ndaily problems as they arise could not be supplied.\r\n\r\nThere is no objection to men of other vocations adopting farming as an\r\navocation if they can afford it. It is a rational form of pleasure for\r\nwealthy people, and one in which they can often be of great service.\r\nThis cannot be said of all forms of relaxation. Wealthy men have been\r\nof special service to the cause of agriculture by promoting the\r\nbreeding of improved live stock. Men in other callings should clearly\r\nunderstand, however, that if they have a farm merely as a place to\r\nspend a week end, that they may expect to find the financial returns\r\nunsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nTo no one is there more significance in the old school aphorism\r\n\"knowledge is power\" than to the young man who is to become a farmer.\r\nWhile it is not necessary to be educated in schools in order to gain\r\nknowledge, yet the schoolroom with all its limitations is usually the\r\nmost economical and most efficient method of acquiring certain forms of\r\nknowledge essential to every successful man or woman. A farm-to-farm\r\ncanvass of a certain region of the state of New York discloses the fact\r\nthat farmers with college training are obtaining a higher income from\r\ntheir farms than those whose school days ended with high school.\r\nSimilarly, those who have finished the high school are more prosperous\r\nfinancially than those who never advanced beyond the grades. The\r\ninvestigation showed, for example, that with the farmers under\r\nobservation the high school education was equivalent to $6,000 worth of\r\n5% bonds. Farming is an occupation requiring keen observation, sound\r\njudgment and accurate reasoning, all attributes which are strengthened\r\ngreatly by proper education. This is so true that many men, perhaps\r\nmost men, are forty before they have grasped the problems which the\r\ntruly successful farmer must solve.\r\n\r\nA considerable part of the knowledge essential to success in any\r\npursuit is acquired by actually working at the occupation, or, as we\r\nsay, by practical experience. Some features of any occupation can be\r\nobtained in no other way. A preliminary education may, however,\r\ngreatly reduce the time necessary to acquire even this practical\r\nexperience. For example, a course in shop work as taught in technical\r\nhigh schools and colleges, requiring two hours a day for five months,\r\nmay shorten the time of apprenticeship by one or more years, in\r\nacquiring the trade of carpenter or iron worker. In the same manner a\r\ncourse in butter making, cheese making or floriculture, may shorten\r\nthe time required to obtain the necessary practical details by ten\r\nmonths or even more. Eventually, also, the man thus trained will be\r\nthe better man.\r\n\r\nIf the industrial activities of the world be divided into farming,\r\nmining, manufacturing, trade and transportation, it will be noted at\r\nonce that farming is the only one which deals with living things. In\r\nfact, the definition of agriculture, in its broadest sense, is the\r\neconomic production of living things. The farmer is thus brought face\r\nto face with some of the most difficult and intricate problems with\r\nwhich the human race has to grapple. It is this fact that makes\r\nfarming, in some ways, the most uncertain as well as the most\r\nfascinating occupation known to man. The fact that the farmer is\r\ndealing with living things puts his occupation in a class by itself\r\nfor a number of reasons, one of which is germane to the subject of\r\nthis chapter.\r\n\r\nIn most occupations a larger part of the knowledge necessary to success\r\ncan be acquired by doing than is the case in farming. Locomotive\r\nengineers are trained for their responsible duty while firing the\r\nengine. The brakeman becomes a conductor by assisting the latter. A\r\nbank cashier is usually a promoted bank clerk. Each obtained the\r\nknowledge essential to success largely by oft-repeated performance.\r\n\r\nWhile, of course, there is much the farmer can learn only by\r\nexperience, there are many things essential to his success that the\r\nmere performance of the necessary farm operations will not teach him.\r\nSpreading manure will never teach him that stable manure should be\r\nsupplemented with phosphoric acid in order to get the best results. The\r\ngrowing of clover will not teach him that mineral fertilizer may keep\r\nup the fertility of the soil where clover grows luxuriantly and occurs\r\nin the rotation at definite intervals. Feeding cattle will not teach\r\nhim that a good ration for milch cows is one containing one pound of\r\ndigestible protein to seven pounds of digestible carbohydrates,\r\nprovided it is palatable and, at least, two-thirds of the total ration\r\nis digestible. Nor will the feeding of such a ration teach the farmer\r\nhow to calculate the most economical ration from feeding stuffs at\r\ncurrent prices. The cause of potato blight and the methods of combating\r\nit cannot be learned from the operation of planting and cultivating\r\npotatoes.\r\n\r\nThese are only a few illustrations--they might be multiplied\r\nindefinitely--to show that farming is peculiar in that performance of\r\nthe daily duties does not give the knowledge essential to success in\r\nthe same measure that it does in such occupations as banking, trade\r\nand transportation. Yet, curiously enough, while no man would\r\nundertake to run a locomotive engine or perform the duties of cashier\r\nof a bank without thorough training, there are many who will undertake\r\nto farm without education or knowledge of the business.\r\n\r\nThe young man who intends to become a farmer should fully understand\r\nthat if farming is not a business worthy of a thoroughly educated man,\r\nit is not a business worthy of him; because every young man is worthy\r\nof a thorough education, provided he is a man of clean habits and good\r\npurposes. Do not allow yourself to be persuaded that you lack ability\r\nto acquire a good education. All you require is opportunity,\r\ndetermination and honesty of intention.\r\n\r\nFarming is worthy, moreover, of the most highly educated as well as\r\nthe most capable. If lack of means prevents a young man from taking a\r\nfour-years' training in agriculture, he will find a two years' course\r\noffered by many of the state agricultural schools. While it is\r\nobviously impossible to give in two years as much training as in four\r\nyears, these two years' courses contain the more technical subjects\r\nand are usually very thorough and efficient. No young man, no matter\r\nhow thorough his previous training, need hesitate to pursue one of\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, young men who cannot spare the time and expense of\r\neven two years' training. For such many state agricultural colleges\r\noffer winter terms of eight to twelve weeks. These courses are\r\narranged to allow the student to specialize along some particular\r\nline. The better prepared the man is who enters these winter courses\r\nthe more he will benefit by them. This leads to the caution that such\r\ncourses should not be substituted for the education offered in the\r\npublic schools, but should only be sought after all the opportunities\r\nfor education at home have been exhausted.\r\n\r\nFor the somewhat older young man who is now farming and cannot leave\r\nhis farm or for the younger man as a preparation for the short\r\ncourses, one or more correspondence courses will be found useful. Not\r\nall colleges conduct correspondence courses, but fortunately those who\r\ndo will accept students from other states on equal terms. There are\r\nmany persons who will testify to their helpfulness.\r\n\r\nEvery young farmer should have a carefully selected library of\r\nstandard books on agriculture, not only for reading but for reference.\r\nAn instance of the value of a standard book of reference came recently\r\nto the attention of the writer. An educated young farmer in Iowa paid\r\n$2.50 for a peck of crimson clover seed which he sowed in the spring\r\nin his oats. A reference to any standard publication on forage crops\r\ncosting less than the peck of seed would have disclosed to him the\r\nprobable hopelessness of success under the conditions named.\r\n\r\nThe books to include as well as to exclude from a select list will\r\ndepend upon the previous training of the man making the purchase, the\r\ncharacter of the farming to be pursued, and, to some extent, to the\r\nsection of the country where the farm is located. Any bookseller can\r\nsecure catalogs issued by firms making a specialty of publishing\r\nagricultural books. For the average reader these catalogs are\r\nsufficient to enable one to make intelligent purchases.\r\n\r\nEvery farmer should take one or more agricultural journals. At present\r\njournals are published on every phase of agriculture and many of them\r\nare of high character. Publishers are always glad to send sample\r\ncopies free of charge. By examining these copies intelligent selection\r\nmay be made.\r\n\r\nThe writer of this book has had rather unusual opportunity during more\r\nthan a quarter of a century of observing the influence of education\r\nupon the success, financial and otherwise, of those who engage in\r\nfarming. As the result of these observations he wishes to urge every\r\nyoung man to allow no one to persuade him that because he is to be a\r\nfarmer, he does not need a thorough education. Remember that you have\r\nbut one life to live, and if you let the golden opportunity pass, the\r\nmistake can never be rectified. No man ever regretted that he had too\r\nmuch education--thousands have regretted the lack of it.\r\n\r\nEvery young man, no matter what his occupation is to be, should\r\nreceive some school training, however little it may be, every year\r\nuntil he reaches the age of majority. Otherwise the age of majority\r\nshould be changed. In no occupation is this more important than in\r\nfarming, because the operations involved in farming fail to develop\r\ncertain attributes necessary to the largest success.\r\n\r\nA man cannot have a mind too well trained, although it is possible\r\nthat he may have too much undigested information. The mental condition\r\nmay not be unlike the physical condition of the man who is burdened\r\nwith too many clothes. When in action he may need to strip his mind of\r\nunnecessary information in order to make the most efficient mental\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n                       MEANS OF ACQUIRING LAND\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the three essentials to successful farming--capital, knowledge and\r\nlove for the calling--only the first can be obtained on credit, and\r\nthis only in part. Usually when a man desires to buy a farm he must\r\nhave, at least, one-third of his desired investment in cash. The\r\namount to be invested will include, not only the cost of the land, but\r\nthe cost of the necessary equipment of the farm. The percentage of the\r\ntotal capital which may be borrowed, however, will depend on many\r\ncircumstances and is usually a matter of first importance. No man\r\nshould borrow more than a banker or other reputable business man\r\nconsiders a safe investment.\r\n\r\nUsually there is no better counselor as to a safe investment than the\r\nlocal banker. The banker should, and generally does, stand in much the\r\nsame relation to the financial welfare of the community as the\r\nphysician to its physical, the minister to its moral and spiritual\r\nwelfare. The inexperienced person, even if he does not need to borrow\r\nmoney, would do well to consult some responsible banker in the\r\nneighborhood before making an investment in farm lands.\r\n\r\nThe young man should, as early as possible in life, open an account\r\nwith the local bank, not merely for the sake of the habit of saving\r\nwhich this will encourage, but in order to come into personal business\r\nrelations with the banker. Instead of concealing from the bank his\r\nbusiness operations, he should seek the advice of his banker on all\r\nimportant financial matters.\r\n\r\nOn an average, every farm changes hands at least three times in a\r\ncentury. Every farm, therefore, must be acquired by purchase,\r\ninheritance or gift at more or less irregular intervals. In the\r\nneighborhood in which the author was born, there is not a farm but has\r\nchanged hands since he can remember. In many cases the farm is now in\r\nthe possession of a son; in some instances in that of a grandson of\r\nthe owner as known by the writer in his boyhood days. In this\r\nparticular community the acquirement of a farm by a person not related\r\nto the former owner has occurred in relatively few instances.\r\n\r\nAs a rule, when the farm has been acquired by a son, the latter has\r\noperated the farm as tenant or partner for a period previous to his\r\nownership and during lifetime of the father. In some instances the son\r\nhas boarded with the parents or the parents with the son and his wife;\r\nor, in the case of a daughter, with the daughter and son-in-law.\r\n\r\nWhere there are several heirs, as is apt to be the case, the son\r\noperating the farm is required to purchase or rent the interest of the\r\nother heirs, unless the farm is large enough to be divided, which is\r\nless seldom the case than is popularly supposed. Thus, if there are\r\n200 acres of land worth $50 an acre, and five heirs, the young farmer\r\nmay inherit $2,000, and be required to assume the remaining $8,000 as\r\nan obligation. He may borrow this money at the bank, placing a\r\nmortgage upon the farm, thus settling with the other heirs at once. Or\r\nhe may pay the other heirs rent on their share of the farm. In any\r\ncase he will, if successful, gradually cancel his obligation and\r\nbecome owner of the farm. That no heir is willing to assume this\r\nresponsibility is the most common reason for a farm changing from one\r\nfamily to another, and the disruption of community interests.\r\n\r\nThe customary, or normal, method of acquiring land has been and still\r\nis a combination of tenancy, inheritance and mortgage. Without some\r\ntenant system and without the farm mortgage, it would be impossible\r\nfor the average young man to acquire a farm. That men are constantly\r\nadvancing from farm tenant to landowner is shown by statistics giving\r\nthe percentage of tenants by ages. The majority of farmers under 30\r\nare renters. Most farmers over 45 are owners of farm land. Thus in\r\nIllinois, in 1900, approximately 75% of the farmers under 25 years of\r\nage rented their farms, while less than 20% of the farmers over 55\r\nyears of age were tenants.\r\n\r\nThe question for the young man to consider is not what effect the\r\ntenant system has upon the welfare of the nation or what political\r\nills may be connected with farm mortgages, but how to make use of\r\nthese necessary and beneficent agencies for the acquirement of a farm.\r\nA system of tenancy which leads to absent landlordism and a permanent\r\ntenant class is thoroughly vicious, while a practice which enables a\r\nman to become, within a reasonable period, a land-owning farmer is a\r\nthoroughly approvable and, indeed, necessary method of acquiring land.\r\n\r\nAs already indicated, most young men will need in some form or other\r\nto employ more capital than they possess when they start farming. They\r\nmust, therefore, determine what is the best form of obtaining the\r\nnecessary capital, viz.: whether to borrow the money on a farm\r\nmortgage, or whether to use the capital someone else has invested in a\r\nfarm by paying him rent for it. The conditions of tenancy in this\r\ncountry are often not the most fortunate, yet the young man of\r\ncharacter may well find, for a time, at least, it would be best for\r\nhim to rent a farm and invest his own capital in the necessary\r\nmachinery and live stock to conduct it properly.\r\n\r\nMuch will depend on the character of the arrangement which may be\r\nmade. Usually more favorable terms can be secured from landlords\r\nowning large numbers of farms than from the owner of one or two farms.\r\nThe large landowner is content with a moderate income from each farm,\r\nbecause in the aggregate his income is sufficient for his needs, while\r\nthe retired farmer who must live off the proceeds of a single farm is\r\napt to drive a hard bargain and may not be over particular concerning\r\nthe maintenance of said farm. The writer knows a farmer who owns a\r\ngood farm purchased from the proceeds of a rented farm. He continues\r\nto live on the rented farm and rents his own, because, it is said, his\r\nlandlord is willing to make him more favorable terms than he makes to\r\nhis tenant.\r\n\r\nThe more capable the tenant the more favorable the terms he may exact.\r\nCertain tenants are in demand and can have their choice of farms. A\r\nprosperous-looking man was pointed out recently as an example of a\r\ntenant capable of buying a farm in one of the most highly developed\r\ncounties in the United States. It was stated that as a renter he could\r\nhave his choice of any farm in the county, but that he did not have a\r\ndollar invested in farm land. Possibly he invests his surplus earnings\r\nin stocks and bonds.\r\n\r\nIt is not the present purpose to determine the relative merits of the\r\ndifferent systems of land tenure, but to try to be helpful to the\r\nbeginners by discussing the usual practices in order that he may know\r\nwhether the arrangement he is considering is customary and whether it\r\nis likely to prove satisfactory.\r\n\r\nEvery third farm in the United States is rented under one of three\r\nmethods:\r\n\r\n1. A definite money rent may be paid, ranging from $2 to $6 an acre\r\nfor land on which the ordinary, staple crops are raised. Perhaps $3 to\r\n$4 is more commonly paid for such land.\r\n\r\n2. In the South it is common for the landlord to require a definite\r\nnumber of pounds of cotton per acre or a certain number of bales of\r\ncotton for a one or two-mule farm, as the case may be. This is\r\nclassified by the census authorities as \"cash rent,\" but will here be\r\ncalled \"crop rent.\" Crop rent is less common than either cash or share\r\nrent in the northern and western states, although perhaps the most\r\ncommon form in the South. Crop rent, however, is met with in some\r\nsections, as in western New York where certain large landowners\r\nrequire a definite number of bushels of wheat, oats or maize and make\r\ncertain stipulations as to hay and straw. They charge a cash rent for\r\npasture.\r\n\r\n3. Much the most common form of tenancy, however, is that where a\r\ncertain percentage or share of the product is given the landlord for\r\nthe use of the land.\r\n\r\nBefore entering into a discussion of the customary conditions under\r\nwhich land is rented on shares it may be helpful to point out the\r\nfundamental differences between cash rent, crop rent and share rent.\r\nIn case of cash rent, the landlord takes no risk, either as to the\r\nprice or the amount of product. In the case of crop rent, he shares\r\nthe risk as to the variation in price, but not as to the amount of\r\ncrop raised. The latter may depend upon the clemency of the weather or\r\nupon the industry and skill of the tenant. In the case of share rent,\r\nboth landlord and tenant share equally as to variation in the price\r\nand the amount of product.\r\n\r\nThree forms of share rent may be recognized:\r\n\r\n(a) Where landlord furnishes only real estate (land and buildings),\r\nthe tenant supplying everything else, including teams, machinery,\r\nlabor, seeds and fertilizers. Under these conditions it is customary\r\nfor the landlord to receive one-third and the tenant two-thirds of the\r\ncrop raised or the product produced.\r\n\r\n(b) The second form of share rent is where the landlord furnishes the\r\nreal estate; the tenant supplies teams, tools and labor, while the\r\nlandlord and tenant own equally all live stock other than teams, and\r\nbear equally all other expenses, as for seeds, fertilizers and cost of\r\nthreshing. Under this system, it is customary for landlord and tenant\r\neach to receive one-half of all sales. As each owns one-half of all\r\nthe live stock (teams excepted), each shares equally in all increase.\r\nThe landlord pays for the cost of permanent improvements such as new\r\nbuildings, fences, repairs and drainage. The tenant, in making these\r\nimprovements, in some cases, agrees to furnish two days' labor for one\r\nday's pay. The theory is that, while the increased value of the real\r\nestate is of advantage only to the landlord, the improved facilities\r\nare of some benefit to the tenant. Since he can do this work at odd\r\ntimes when not otherwise employed, he can afford to take a generous\r\nview of the matter. It is obvious that if he remains on the farm long\r\nenough the tenant will come into his share of the benefit, while if he\r\nintends to leave the farm soon he may not. There is in the mind of the\r\nwriter a prosperous tenant who, after eighteen years on a single farm,\r\ndeclared he had no desire to make a change, and doubtless there are\r\nthousands of similar instances.\r\n\r\nUnder the plan in which the tenant furnishes everything except the\r\nreal estate, the tendency of the farm is apt to be downward both as to\r\nthe improvements and the crop-producing power of the soil. The\r\ninterests of the landlord and tenant are not mutual. This condition of\r\ntenancy leads to growing only those crops which can be readily sold\r\nfrom the farm and to frequent changes of the tenant, with its\r\naccompanying auction sales of property. In one region, where this\r\nsystem prevails, it has been facetiously remarked that each tenant has\r\na sale every year to determine how much he is worth. It is less\r\ntrouble than taking an inventory.\r\n\r\nIn the second form of share rent, the interests of landlord and tenant\r\nare more nearly mutual. Under this system, animal husbandry is\r\npossible, which, generally, involves pasturing and feeding a\r\nconsiderable part of the crops upon the farm, and even the purchase of\r\nnitrogenous by-products. All this leads to permanency of tenant, since\r\nthe landlord and tenant are both interested in the live stock and\r\nother personal property, which cannot be divided, with economy, each\r\nyear. It is interesting to note that the house is the least likely to\r\nbe kept in repair. The improvement of the barns and fences or the\r\nlaying of tile drains increases the landlord's income, but he has no\r\nfinancial interest in the house, so long as the tenant is willing to\r\nlive in it.\r\n\r\nThere are, of course, many variations in the arrangement of details\r\nbetween the landlord and tenant. On many dairy farms in the northeastern\r\nstates it is customary for the landlord to own the cows. While the\r\nlandlord and tenant share equally from the sale of milk, butter or\r\ncheese, in such cases the increase in the herd belongs to the owner of\r\nthe land. Hence, money from the sale of any animal, old or young, goes\r\nto him. This is because the landlord must keep up the herd. If a cow is\r\nsold, he must furnish another to take her place.\r\n\r\n(c) The third type of tenant farming is where the tenant furnishes\r\nnothing but his labor and managerial ability, and receives a share of\r\nthe sales, which may be one-third. This is rather an unusual type of\r\ntenancy, since, where the landlord furnishes all the capital, it is\r\nmuch more common to employ a farm manager at a monthly wage. The wage\r\nvaries greatly, but is seldom below forty dollars or above seventy-five\r\ndollars per month without board, especially to those who have not\r\nhitherto had much managerial experience.\r\n\r\nVarious attempts at profit sharing have been made. A recent instance\r\nis of a young married man taking 160 acres of tillable land where the\r\nlandlord has a fairly well-stocked farm. The young man is to have a\r\nhouse and everything in the way of living the farm can furnish. He is\r\nto receive $20 a month and one-half the net proceeds, or, what is\r\ncalled in Chapter XI, the farm income. In considering a contract of\r\nthis kind it is necessary to make a careful distinction between: (1)\r\nGross sales, (2) net proceeds, viz.: the gross sales less the expenses\r\nof running the farm, and (3) profits, which may be defined for the\r\npurpose of this discussion as the net proceeds less the interest on\r\nthe investment.[A]\r\n\r\nAssuming 160 acres of land, all tillable, devoted to dairy farming in\r\neastern United States, gross sales may be estimated at $20 an acre, or\r\nan annual gross income of $3,200, and the net proceeds at $10 an acre,\r\nor $1,600. Under these conditions the young man's income would be\r\n$240, received as wages, plus $800, as his share of the net proceeds,\r\nor a total of $1,040 a year.\r\n\r\nGenerally speaking, probably a more satisfactory method, both for\r\nlandlord and the farm manager, would be to pay the latter as nearly as\r\nmay be what his services should be worth and give him in addition\r\none-half the profits; that is, one-half of that which was left after\r\ndeducting the expenses of running the farm and interest on the capital\r\ninvested.\r\n\r\nMerely for illustrating the method of calculation, let us assume this\r\nfarm with its equipment to be worth $100 an acre, or $16,000. Let the\r\nfarm manager be paid $840 a year. Assume the same gross income,\r\n$3,200, and the same cost of operating, $1,600, to which add $600, the\r\nadditional salary of the manager. The total expense is then $2,200,\r\nand the net proceeds $1,000. If 4%, or $640, was charged on the\r\ninvestment, there would be $360 to be divided between landlord and\r\nmanager, making the salary of manager $1,020. A simple calculation\r\nwill show that if 5% were charged, the salary of the manager would be\r\n$940 a year, and if 6%, $860 a year. The advantage of the latter\r\nmethod of employment is that the young man runs less risk, while both\r\nreceive equally any surplus beyond fair wages and fair interest on the\r\ninvestment.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it is important to consider how much may be\r\nreasonably paid for managerial ability. A study of the figures on page\r\n133 will show that the labor income from a considerable number of\r\nfarms of the better class was about 7% of the capital invested in the\r\nfarms. The inference is, therefore, that if a man has $10,000 wisely\r\ninvested in a farm he may pay $700 for a working manager; or, to put\r\nit in another form, before the owner of a farm can afford to pay\r\n$1,200 a year for a farm manager, he should have about $17,000\r\ninvested. Moreover, this investment must be in a form calculated to\r\nreturn an income. If part of it consists of investments for pleasure\r\nor fancy, such investment will not only not add to the income, but\r\nwill detract from it by increasing the cost of maintenance.\r\n\r\nThis is scarcely less important to the employee than it is to the\r\nemployer, since if the owner pays a higher salary than the manager can\r\nearn, he quite surely will sooner or later discharge his manager. This\r\nmay result disastrously for the discharged young man, not merely on\r\naccount of the loss of employment, but because his failure may\r\nmilitate against his securing satisfactory employment elsewhere. When\r\nan employer is seeking a man, he looks for one who has succeeded.\r\nThere is an old saying, \"Nothing succeeds like success,\" and it is\r\nonly too true that nothing fails like failure.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n  [A] Profit is sometimes defined as that part of the product which\r\n      the producer can consume without reducing his means of production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                          FARM ORGANIZATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the last chapter were discussed the most common methods by which a\r\nyoung man acquires an opportunity to engage in farming. This chapter\r\nwill discuss some less common arrangements by which may be bridged\r\nthat period between the time the son is ready to go into the business\r\nand the time he may assume the complete control of the ancestral or\r\nother farm. It will also suggest a method for the continuous business\r\nmanagement of a farm enterprise.\r\n\r\nAs stated, the most common reason for a farm changing from one family\r\nto another is the fact that no heir is willing to assume the\r\nobligation which is involved in paying for the interest of the other\r\nheirs. Connected with this problem is the further fact that the father\r\nis not usually ready to give up the management of the farm at the time\r\none of his sons reaches the age to go into active business.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this state of affairs is made clear by the results of\r\ninsurance statistics. The period that a man may be expected to live\r\ncan be obtained by taking the difference between his present age and\r\n90 and dividing the remainder by two. Thus, a young man who is 20 may\r\nreasonably expect to live 35 years, or until he is 55 years old. A man\r\nat 50, however, still has an expectation of life of 20 years, and the\r\nman of 70 of 10 years.\r\n\r\nA farmer of 50 will usually have one or more sons ready to go to\r\nfarming if they ever expect to engage in farming. But, as has been\r\nshown, a man of 50 has a reasonable expectation of 20 more years of\r\nlife and cannot turn over the farm to his son, completely, without\r\ndestroying his own opportunity for earning a livelihood. As things are\r\nusually arranged, therefore, there is no place on the average farm for\r\nthe son, except as a hired hand, which is not desired permanently by\r\neither father or son.\r\n\r\nFrequently the father fails to appreciate the earning power of his\r\nson, and, what is more important, that the boy has grown into a man.\r\nOne day a teacher called a student of agriculture to his office, when\r\nthe following conversation occurred:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Armstrong, Austinburg, Ashtabula county, Ohio, was a\r\ndairy tenant farmer for twenty years with nothing to show for his labor\r\nbut a debt of $500. He then bought the farm of 144 acres on which he\r\nlives, without cash payment, assuming a debt of $7,000. At the end of ten\r\nyears he owned his farm and equipment valued at $20,000. He has two sons\r\nwho have been important factors in his success. A year ago one of them\r\nmarried and went to a farm of his own, the father paying him $3,000 for\r\nhis former labor.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John M. Hunt, Ackley, Iowa, two years a student at Iowa\r\nState College. He returned to the home farm of 120 acres, which, without\r\nany capital, he rented from his father. At the age of 25 his gross\r\nreceipts from this farm were a little over $4,000. After paying rent,\r\nliving, keeping a family of four, a few trips to fairs and corn shows,\r\nhe had net $1,500 for his year's work. Picture shows home with father,\r\nmother and sister in the foreground.]\r\n\r\n\"The Bureau of Soils at Washington,\" said the teacher, \"has asked me\r\nto recommend several of our students to them for positions as field\r\nassistants. If you desire to have me do so, I would be glad to\r\nrecommend you for one of these positions. The compensation is $1,000 a\r\nyear and field expenses.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not believe that I can accept,\" said Mr. Manning, \"my father is\r\nin poor health and needs my help on the farm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Does your father want you to take charge of the farm and manage it so\r\nthat you can make your training count?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; my father expects to continue to manage the farm. He wishes me to\r\nwork for him.\"\r\n\r\n\"How much does your father expect to pay you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Thirty dollars a month.\"\r\n\r\nThe teacher found it extremely difficult not to interfere, but he\r\nmerely said, \"This is a case of filial duty which you must settle for\r\nyourself. I must have nothing further to say.\"\r\n\r\nThe young man returned to the ancestral home and is probably still\r\nthere. It is, of course, impossible to determine the merits of an\r\nindividual case, but this incident represents a type of cases where\r\nthe son makes two important sacrifices from the sense of duty.\r\n\r\nFirst, he sacrifices present, and, perhaps, future opportunity to earn\r\nthe wages of which he is capable and to which he is justly entitled.\r\nAnd, second, and more important, he sacrifices the opportunity to\r\ndevelop his own powers and make concrete his own abstract self.\r\n\r\nThere are two things that every young man should do. One is to earn a\r\nliving. A man that cannot or does not earn a living is of no value to\r\nhimself or to anyone else. The other is to develop within himself his\r\nlatent possibilities. He must apply himself to some problem, or\r\nproblems, and through them develop his own personality. There is no\r\nplace where more intricate and satisfying problems may be found than\r\nin the development of a successful farming enterprise. In the instance\r\ncited, the father may have been unable to pay his son the wage he\r\nmight have obtained elsewhere, but he did not need to dwarf his son's\r\ndevelopment by treating him merely as a hired hand. His willingness to\r\ndo so was probably due to his failure to appreciate that his son had\r\nbecome a man.\r\n\r\nSometimes a father is astute enough to reorganize his business so as to\r\nretain a place for himself while giving to his sons that opportunity\r\nwhich every man must have who develops himself normally.\r\n\r\nAn Ohio farmer once came to the Dean's office. He had a son in college\r\nwho was just completing the first year of a two years' course in\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\n\"I should like to have you find a place for my son in a cheese factory\r\nduring the coming summer,\" said Mr. McKinley.\r\n\r\n\"I own a farm of 130 acres on which I have a herd of Jersey cattle,\"\r\ncontinued the father. \"I have two sons and one daughter. I would like\r\nto have my sons about me, but there is no place for them on my farm\r\nbecause I am there and cannot get away. In fact, I do not desire to\r\ngive up the management of the farm and the development of the herd of\r\ncattle.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not every father sees the situation as clearly as you do,\" interjected\r\nthe Dean.\r\n\r\n\"This is my plan. After my son has spent a summer in a cheese factory,\r\nI want him to come back to your school for another year. I want him to\r\nlearn, especially, all you teach about dairying. I will then build a\r\ncheese factory on my own farm and my son will make into cheese the\r\nmilk of my own herd, and also from the herds of our neighbors. By the\r\ntime he has completed his work with you, my younger son will have\r\nfinished the high school. He has some liking for trading, and he will\r\nsell the cheese at wholesale and deliver it to the surrounding towns\r\nwhere markets are unexcelled. As for the daughter,\" continued this\r\npractical man, \"she will get married and that will take care of her.\"\r\n\r\nWhat became of the daughter is not known to the writer, but the rest\r\nof the program was carried out successfully and continued for many\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nA German came to this country and settled in New Jersey, where he\r\nestablished a large orchard. In course of time his two sons grew into\r\nmanhood. While, of course, requiring plenty of laborers, the\r\norchardist did not need the sons in the management of his farm. He,\r\ntherefore, established one of these sons in the commission business in\r\nPhiladelphia, thus, at least, keeping the profits on the sale of the\r\nproducts of his orchard in the family. He also needed cold storage for\r\nhis fruit. The other son started a cold storage plant, which plays an\r\nimportant part in the profitable management of the orchard. Thus both\r\nsons have independent employment requiring managerial ability and the\r\norchard is much more profitable than it otherwise would be.\r\n\r\nOur land laws, our traditions and our practices are based upon the\r\nidea that a farm is to provide activity and support for but one\r\nfamily. In order, therefore, that the son may marry and begin to\r\ndevelop his life in his own way, it is essential to reorganize in some\r\nmanner the method of managing the farm or to enlarge or, perhaps,\r\nspecialize its activities. This may be accomplished on a simple\r\npartnership basis, or it may be in some such line as outlined in the\r\nillustrations which have been given. In other occupations such\r\nco-operative effort is the rule rather than the exception. That it is\r\nmore difficult to effect satisfactory arrangements in farming must be\r\nconceded, else they would be more common. Doubtless it will often tax\r\nthe ingenuity of father and son to devise the plans best suited to\r\nmeet their particular problem.\r\n\r\nThere still remains to consider another form of business relation as\r\napplied to farming which has become almost universal in trade and\r\ntransportation. The following incident may illustrate and emphasize\r\nthe problem better than abstract discussion: One day a man walked into\r\nan office and stated that a friend had a half million dollars to\r\ninvest in farming, provided that he could be convinced that the money\r\nwould be invested profitably.\r\n\r\n\"Does your friend desire to buy land in any particular locality?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the promoter, \"he wishes to buy land near ----. He has\r\nsome sentiment about it. He was born in that neighborhood.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, that is a rather bad beginning. Farming on sentiment is\r\ndangerous, especially when the sentiment is in no way related to the\r\nbusiness.\"\r\n\r\nThe facts were that the region indicated was recognized to be one of\r\nthe most unpromising sections of the state.\r\n\r\n\"If you undertake to invest a half million dollars in one neighborhood,\"\r\ncontinued the adviser, \"you will pretty certainly fail to earn interest\r\non your investment.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" inquired the promoter.\r\n\r\n\"Before you could possibly buy any considerable part of the land the\r\nowners of the farms you desire to buy would have doubled or perhaps\r\ntrebled the price asked for their holdings. It is one thing to earn\r\ninterest on an investment of $30 an acre and quite another to earn an\r\nequal per cent on $60 or $90 an acre.\r\n\r\n\"In the second place, farmers are content to accept less per cent on\r\ntheir capital than they would if it was loaned at interest, because\r\nthe farm furnishes a home as well as a business. When you buy up all\r\nthese farms and convert them into a single enterprise you will destroy\r\ntheir home value. You cannot hope to compete with the man, who,\r\nbecause his farm furnishes him a home, is content with an otherwise\r\nsmall return on his investment.\"\r\n\r\nThere were other reasons, of course, why such an enterprise would\r\nfail, which the speaker did not stop to explain.\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken,\" challenged the promoter. \"I intend to meet both\r\nyour objections. My plan is to form a corporation and issue both\r\npreferred and common stock. The preferred stock shall bear 5% and that\r\nwill belong to my friend who furnishes the money. I will retain the\r\ncommon stock. Five per cent is all the owner of the money is entitled\r\nto, while if the business returns more than that amount, it will be\r\ndue to my management. I, and those associated with me, are entitled to\r\nall that is made above five per cent. By retaining the common stock\r\nthe surplus income will come to us. Neither will I destroy the home\r\nvalue, because I shall associate the former owners with me in the\r\nconduct of the estate and may give them some of the common stock, so\r\nthat they will be interested with me in making a profitable return. If\r\nthey wish to keep their money invested in the farm, they will be given\r\npreferred stock in place of cash for their farms.\"\r\n\r\nIt is needless to say that the promoter never convinced his friend\r\nthat he could successfully invest for him a half million dollars along\r\nthe lines indicated. Nevertheless the corporate plan is not without\r\nmerit. For example, if a father should incorporate his farm, he could\r\nprovide for the inheritance of the preferred stock, among the heirs,\r\nas he desires. He could give to the son who operates the farm all the\r\ncommon stock, together with what preferred stock he is entitled or the\r\nfather may desire him to have. The common stock would provide the\r\nmeans by which the income from the farm, which was due to the sons\r\nskill and management, might go to him. As time went on the son could\r\nacquire additional preferred stock from the father or other heirs, or\r\nhe could invest his earnings elsewhere, as might seem most expedient.\r\nOn the death of the parents, the preferred stock would be distributed\r\nas inheritance or the will provided without in any way interfering\r\nwith the continuity of the farm enterprise. If at any time the son\r\ndesired to discontinue the management of the farm, all he would need\r\nto do would be to dispose of his interest in the common stock at\r\nwhatever he might be able to secure from the man who succeeded to its\r\nmanagement. He could sell or retain his preferred stock.\r\n\r\nFarming is the one remaining great industry that has not been\r\norganized so that a single enterprise may have a continuous existence.\r\nA corporation never dies, but at least three generations of men occupy\r\nthe farms of the United States each century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                     OPPORTUNITIES IN AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nSome years ago, a prominent magazine contained an article entitled\r\n\"The American Farmer's Balance Sheet,\" in which a descendant of the\r\nsecond and sixth Presidents of the United States was shown to have\r\nmade in one year a profit of over $19,000 from a 6,000-acre wheat farm\r\nin North Dakota, and over $50,000 from a 6,000-acre corn farm in Iowa.\r\nA few months later there appeared in the same magazine another\r\narticle, the purport of which was that great wealth, whether it be\r\nobtained from farming, the mining of coal, the manufacture of steel or\r\nthe selling of merchandise, is the exception, while the man, in\r\nwhatever calling, who rears and educates a family and at the same time\r\nlays by a small competence is the normal American product. The moral\r\nis that a $500-a-year-income farm is a more important factor to the\r\nnational welfare than a $50,000-a-year-income farm.\r\n\r\nIn the latter article the writer tells of two brothers who had been\r\nreared on a Michigan farm. Reuben was tired of the country. He went to\r\nthe city and apprenticed himself to a harnessmaker. Against the advice\r\nof young friends, Lucien bought sixty acres of land and ran in debt\r\nfor it.\r\n\r\nIn a year Reuben was earning a dollar a day. He wore a white shirt and\r\npointed shoes, not because they were more comfortable, but because\r\nother people did. He had no debts. Lucien had fair crops, but they\r\nyielded no more than enough to pay interest on the mortgage. He wore a\r\nragged shirt, patched breeches and cowhide boots. People said that\r\nReuben was making a gentleman of himself and learning a trade in the\r\nbargain.\r\n\r\nIn two years, Reuben had completed his apprenticeship. He was now\r\nearning $10 a week. He lived in a house that had a fancy veranda and\r\ngreen blinds. His clothing improved. Lucien was still ragged, but he\r\npaid his interest and $300 each year upon the principal. People said\r\nthat Reuben, the harnessmaker, was bound to come to the front.\r\n\r\nIn ten years more, Reuben was still foreman of the shop at $50 a\r\nmonth. He lived in the same house, and smoked Havana cigars. Lucien\r\nbuilt a new house and a barn. He smoked a pipe. The neighbors saw that\r\nevery year he made some improvement on the farm. He wore a white shirt\r\nwhen he went to town, and he had a pair of button shoes. People said\r\nthat Lucien was becoming a prominent man. His word was good at the\r\nbank.\r\n\r\nReuben began to complain that harnessmaking was too confining. His\r\nhealth was breaking down. The proprietor was selfish. He would not die\r\nand leave the business to him. Harnessmaking was not what it used to\r\nbe. Lucien bought more land. He went fishing when he wanted to. Reuben\r\ncame out now and then to spend Sunday. The birds seemed to sing more\r\nsweetly than ever before and the grass was greener. Lucien endorsed\r\nReuben's note.\r\n\r\nLucien has pigs, and cows, and sheep, and chickens, and turkeys, and\r\nhorses. He raises potatoes and beans, and corn, and wheat, and garden\r\nstuff, and fruit. He buys his groceries and clothing and tobacco.\r\nReuben buys everything. At the close of the year Lucien puts from $100\r\nto $300 in the bank or takes a trip to Washington. Reuben does well if\r\nhe come out even. Lucien does not fret; Reuben grumbles.\r\n\r\nThe picture is true to life. It has been enacted and re-enacted in\r\nevery one of the older communities of the United States.\r\n\r\nIt has always seemed to the writer, however, that the author of this\r\nsuggestive story left out two important personages. They were Sarah,\r\nthe wife of Reuben, and Mary, the wife of Lucien. Sarah liked to make\r\ntatting and to go to pink teas. Mary preferred to raise flowers and\r\nfluffy little chickens. Nothing is to be said for or against the taste\r\nof either. Each has a right to her preference, but their point of view\r\ncannot be left out of the problem when a young man is considering his\r\nfuture occupation.\r\n\r\nIt has been said, and probably with considerable truth, that most\r\ncongressmen would not hang around Washington if it were not for their\r\nwives.\r\n\r\nNo one must mistake this story as an attempt to compare harness making\r\nwith farming, much less to compare living in the city with life in the\r\nopen country.\r\n\r\nWhat it does is to compare the struggle and the development of the man\r\nwho goes into business for himself with the man who accepts employment\r\nat wages.\r\n\r\nBecause of less responsibility and less sacrifices at the beginning,\r\nthe tendency is for young men to work for wages rather than to engage\r\nin business for themselves. This is becoming more and more true as\r\nindustrial methods make it more and more difficult for the young man\r\nto command the requisite capital.\r\n\r\nThe man who works for wages usually has the larger income and appears\r\nthe most prosperous during the earlier years as compared with his\r\nbrother who enters business. The business man, however, who, while\r\nyoung, economizes and invests his savings in his business gradually\r\noutstrips his wage-earning brother. During later life he is able to\r\nenjoy the fruits of his earlier economy and investments, while failing\r\npowers and keen competition of younger and better trained men restrict\r\nthe opportunities of the wage earner, who has generally spent his\r\nwages in better living, or at least in more outward show.\r\n\r\nThis is well shown by the fact that it is customary to make provision\r\nby means of pensions for wage earners of all sorts, while no such\r\narrangement is made for men who engage in business, be that farming,\r\ntrade or transportation.\r\n\r\nFor many reasons, however, young men will continue to seek employment\r\nat wages, even if only for a few years, or until some capital has been\r\nacquired which may be invested in business.\r\n\r\nThe question arises, therefore, what opportunities there may be for\r\nthe young man who desires to engage, eventually, in the business of\r\nfarming to work for wages along lines that will not be too far removed\r\nfrom the business in which he is subsequently to engage. It will be\r\nassumed that the young man has prepared himself in that same\r\npainstaking way that he would if he were preparing to become an\r\nengineer, a lawyer or a physician.\r\n\r\nThere is a constant demand for men with proper training as managers of\r\nfarms. As stated elsewhere, the wages are seldom less than $40 nor more\r\nthan $75 a month to beginners, although for men of experience $5,000 a\r\nyear has been paid in exceptional cases for the management of large\r\nenterprises. These positions often constitute ideal opportunities for\r\ncapable young men. They require, however, not only an intimate\r\nknowledge of farming, but the ability, also, to manage men.\r\n\r\nThe ability to manage men requires the combination of decision and\r\ntact, not possessed by all, and not easily acquired by education or\r\npractice. Not only must the farm manager be able to manage workmen,\r\nbut oftentimes he must manage his employer, who may have little\r\nknowledge of farming but still insists upon having his own ideas\r\nexecuted, as he, of course, has a perfect right to do.\r\n\r\nAnother danger is the fact that where the farm is owned by a man\r\nengaged in other business, many circumstances may arise to cause the\r\nowner to change his plans or sell his property. There is often,\r\ntherefore, a lack of permanency in these positions.\r\n\r\nThe United States Department of Agriculture employs upward of 5,000\r\npeople. There is a constant demand for young men to recruit this\r\nservice, including experts in soils, plant production, animal\r\nhusbandry, dairying, chemistry and forestry. Beginners receive from\r\n$800 to $1,000 a year. When they are sent out of Washington into field\r\nservice, as many of them are, they receive their expenses, including\r\nsubsistence in addition. Young men may rise rather rapidly by\r\npromotion to $1,600 a year, then more slowly to $2,000, while an\r\noccasional man is promoted to the more responsible position paying\r\n$3,000 to $4,000 a year.\r\n\r\nThe positions are all filled through the competitive civil service\r\nexaminations. Examinations are held at more or less irregular\r\nintervals, usually several times a year, in various sections of the\r\ncountry. A letter addressed to the United States Civil Service\r\nCommission will secure the necessary information concerning openings\r\nand the general requirements for the examinations.\r\n\r\nEmployment in the United States Department of Agriculture often\r\naffords opportunity for varied experience and wide observation of\r\nfarming methods throughout the country. Such employment is generally\r\nto be considered desirable if not continued for too long a period. As\r\na matter of fact, men are constantly leaving the service to engage in\r\npractical or other work, a fact which makes the demand for young men\r\ngreater than would otherwise be the case.\r\n\r\nThe various agricultural colleges and experiment stations are\r\nconstantly seeking men. It would seem that the demand would eventually\r\nbe satisfied. As a matter of fact, however, it grows greater year by\r\nyear, both because these institutions continue to grow and because\r\nyoung men are attracted more and more to practical work. It is stated\r\nthat in one institution there were 46 graduates in the course in\r\nanimal husbandry and that 44 went into practical work and only two\r\nsought employment in college or station. The salaries are about the\r\nsame as in government positions.\r\n\r\nAgricultural newspaper work offers an attractive field for young men\r\nwho are properly trained and have a taste for this kind of work.\r\n\r\nThere is also beginning to be quite a demand for teachers of\r\nagriculture in the high schools. As a rule a man is wanted who can\r\nteach, in addition, the sciences usually taught in secondary school.\r\nThe customary salary is from $70 to $100 a month on an eight to ten\r\nmonths' basis. An experience of one or two years as a teacher in a\r\nhigh school, or even the lower grades of the public school, should be\r\ninvaluable to the young man who expects subsequently to engage in\r\nfarming. This is particularly true if he has not had the opportunity\r\nof a college training.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, unnecessary to state that the salaries mentioned in\r\nthis chapter are obtained only by young men who possess certain\r\nqualifications. To secure them, they must be men of ability,\r\nintegrity, virtue and industry. No man who is not willing to make the\r\npreparation necessary to master his subject can expect to succeed. He\r\nmust, also, be a man of absolute honesty, and he must lead a clean\r\nlife. It was Bismarck who said, of German university students,\r\n\"One-third die out; one-third rot out; the other third rule Germany.\"\r\nEvery man who will may choose whether he will belong to Bismarck's\r\nsecond or third class.\r\n\r\nThe question for the young man of 20 is not merely as to the morrow,\r\nbut what is likely to be the trend of events during the next 35 to 50\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\"In 1800 the United States nowhere crossed the Mississippi and nowhere\r\ntouched the Gulf of Mexico.\" In 1850 the country west of the\r\nMississippi River was agriculturally largely an undiscovered region.\r\nSince 1870 we have much more than doubled our population and our\r\nagriculture. Since that time we have subdued more of the open country\r\nto the uses of man than we had been able to do in 250 years of our\r\nprevious history.\r\n\r\nDuring the past 300 years we have prided ourselves upon being an\r\nagricultural people. We have been an agricultural people, but our\r\nproblems have not been chiefly those of the agriculturist, but those\r\nof the engineer.\r\n\r\nOur problem, in the past, has not been to make two blades of grass to\r\ngrow where but one grew before. Our problem has been to harvest and\r\ntransport two bushels of wheat or two bales of cotton with the labor\r\npreviously required to harvest one. Our crops have been so abundant\r\nthat the agricultural problems connected with the growing of them has\r\nbeen secondary to the engineering problems of their harvesting and\r\ntransportation. The self-binder and the steam locomotive have been our\r\nachievements.\r\n\r\nIf the writer mistakes not, the future problem will not be so much the\r\nharvesting and transporting, as the growth of the crops. In the\r\nfuture, young men will be needed who have studied the science of\r\nliving things in order that they may make, literally, two blades of\r\ngrass to grow where but one grew. To men who will be able to do so,\r\nwill come success and honor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                           WHERE TO LOCATE\r\n\r\n\r\nUnless the young farmer expects to return to the ancestral home, the\r\nfirst question he must settle is where he is going to locate. Indeed,\r\none of the most common questions asked is, What do you think of this\r\nstate or that state or this region or that as a place to farm? There\r\nare few questions harder to answer. This is due, among other reasons,\r\nto the fact that every place has its advantages and disadvantages. The\r\nsum of the advantages may be greater in one place than in another, but\r\nif these advantages are known they must generally be paid for.\r\n\r\nNew adaptations, however, may change materially the value of the land\r\nin a given locality as, for example, the discovery that a region is\r\nespecially adapted to raising alfalfa, onions, cabbages, apples or\r\npeaches. Changing conditions, as the growth of population or better\r\ntransportation facilities, may materially affect the attractiveness of\r\na region from the standpoint of the farmer.\r\n\r\nThe competition of other regions which grow similar crops is a potent\r\nfactor in determining the desirability of a region. For example, the\r\nfarmers east of the Allegheny mountains during the nineteenth century\r\ncompeted with the farmers of the central West who had free, fertile,\r\neasily tilled land on which to grow maize, wheat and oats. Cattle and\r\nsheep were pastured on the open range. The twentieth century has found\r\nthe land of this region settled and capitalized in some instances\r\nbeyond that of the eastern states; thus one factor at least of\r\ncompetition has been eliminated.\r\n\r\nWhile farm values readjust themselves in time, it often happens,\r\nespecially in the older settled regions, that farm values are slow in\r\nreflecting these changes in economic conditions. Changed conditions\r\noften call for a change in farm methods which the habits and\r\ntraditions of even one generation prevent. To the man who is able to\r\napply the proper methods the region may be a desirable one, although\r\nunder existing conditions the results may be unsatisfactory. The young\r\nman, however, is cautioned at this point not to be overconfident of\r\nhis own ability. Under such circumstances it is well to study the\r\nproblem with great care, because the methods which seem unwise to the\r\ncasual observer may, after all, be found to be based upon sound\r\neconomic principles.\r\n\r\nA man of 25 who is looking for a location should not only study the\r\npresent conditions of the locality, but try to predict what is likely\r\nto be the future of the region during the next third of a century,\r\nsince this is the period in which he may reasonably expect to be\r\npersonally interested, although later in life he will find himself\r\nquite as much interested in the more distant future on account of his\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nNothing is more self-evident than that one should choose a region,\r\nespecially as regards soil and climate, which is adapted to the crop\r\nor crops to be raised, yet there are probably more failures due to a\r\nlack of crop adaptation than to any other cause that is not personal\r\nto the man himself. Not only do apples, for their best success,\r\nrequire certain soil types, but different varieties of apples require\r\nfor their best development, distinctly different types of soil as, for\r\nexample, Rhode Island Greening, Baldwin, York Imperial and Grime's\r\nGolden. Each reaches its best development on different types of soil\r\nand some require different climatic conditions. In like manner apples\r\nand peaches require distinctly different types of soil for the best\r\nsuccess of each and for this reason peaches are not desirable as\r\nfillers in apple orchards.\r\n\r\nIf at the proper season of the year one goes from Pittsburg to Chicago\r\nvia Columbus and Indianapolis, he will see great fields of winter\r\nwheat and a considerable number of permanent pastures. From Chicago to\r\nOmaha he will see only occasionally a field of wheat and scarcely any\r\npermanent pasture. Oats have taken the place of wheat. In parts of\r\nEastern Kansas and Oklahoma the predominant crop is winter wheat.\r\nThroughout the whole region from Pittsburg to Topeka, Kansas, the\r\ncharacteristic crop is maize or Indian corn. Between St. Paul and\r\nFargo, the main crops are spring wheat and oats. One may travel from\r\nWinnipeg, Manitoba, to Calgary, Alberta, a distance of over one\r\nthousand miles without seeing a field of maize. In some portions the\r\nmain crop is wheat, in others it is oats.\r\n\r\nThese are illustrations of the crop adaptation over large areas, which\r\nhas come about unconsciously, as has most crop adaptation. In other\r\nparts of the United States are to be found even more striking examples\r\nof crop adaptation, although the areas are much smaller, as in the\r\ncase of tobacco, potatoes, celery, onions, apples, peaches and other\r\nfruits. Regions containing residual soils are more variable in crop\r\nadaptation than drift soils and require more careful watchfulness on\r\nthe part of those who may wish to buy land.\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, advantages, if known, must usually be paid for.\r\nIt comes about, therefore, that if a region or a farm is adapted to\r\nthe raising of a certain crop which is more profitable than the\r\naverage, such as maize, tobacco, alfalfa, celery, apples or peaches,\r\nthis land will, other things being equal, command a higher price than\r\nland which does not possess this characteristic.\r\n\r\nThere is an underlying economic principle which the man who goes out\r\nto choose a farm should clearly understand. The principle has been\r\nstated by Fairchild as follows: \"The normal value of products capable\r\nof indefinite multiplication tends always toward the value of least\r\ncostly. On the other hand, if any production cannot be largely\r\nextended, so that the supply barely meets the requirements of the\r\npurchasers, the tendency of normal values is toward the cost of the\r\nmost costly part of the product required to meet wants.\"\r\n\r\nThis principle explains why land especially adapted to raising maize\r\nis higher priced than land primarily adapted to raising wheat. Maize\r\nwhich enters into commerce is raised almost exclusively in ten states\r\nof the United States. Wheat is harvested practically every month of\r\nevery year in different parts of the world. The young farmer should\r\nconsider, therefore, whether he is undertaking to raise crops in which\r\nthere is unlimited competition, or whether soil or other conditions\r\ncause the output to be relatively limited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                             SIZE OF FARM\r\n\r\n\r\nThe size of the farm is another of those questions on which there is\r\nendless debate and to which no general answer can be given. There are,\r\nhowever, certain rather definite principles which may help in settling\r\nan individual problem.\r\n\r\nThe size of the farm is related to the income per acre. If one's ideal\r\nor purpose is a gross income of $1,000 or $3,000 or $5,000 a year, he\r\nmust consider how large a farm will be necessary to bring this return.\r\n\r\nAssume, for the sake of discussion, it is desired to obtain a gross\r\nincome of $4,000. In the eastern United States 200 acres of tillable\r\nland devoted to general farming may bring this amount. If the land is\r\nespecially adapted to potatoes, and this crop takes a prominent place\r\nin the rotation, 100 acres might be sufficient to return the income\r\nnamed. Likewise a 100-acre retail milk dairy farm may produce a\r\nsimilar result. Forty acres devoted to truck farming or market\r\ngardening may be sufficient.\r\n\r\nThere is another way that the size of the farm needed may be\r\nestimated. There is a general relation between the gross income and\r\nthe amount invested. In 1900 the gross income of the farms of the\r\nUnited States was 18 per cent of the total investment, which includes\r\nland, buildings, tools, and live stock. The average gross income\r\nvaried for the different types of farming common to the northern\r\nUnited States from 16 to 19 per cent. This represents, of course, a\r\ngreat deal of very poor farming. The income of prosperous farmers must\r\nbe somewhat better than this. If we assume that by careful methods the\r\ngross income is 25% of the total investment, then an investment of\r\n$16,000 will be required to bring a gross income of $4,000. While it\r\nis true that the gross income has no necessary relation to net income\r\nor profit, yet it is well to remember that a gross income is a\r\nnecessary antecedent of a net income. The net profit from the\r\nproduction of a bushel of wheat, a dozen of eggs, or a pound of butter\r\nis of comparatively small consequence unless a sufficient quantity is\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nA recent investigation by the Cornell station appears to show that\r\nwith the type of farming now existing in Tompkins and Livingston\r\ncounties, New York, where the investigation chanced to be made, the\r\nlarger farms yielded the most profitable returns and that while\r\npresent conditions exist, the size of farms is likely to increase\r\nrather than decrease. The fundamental reason seems to be the\r\nsubstitution of horse-drawn machinery for hand labor.\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the labor income on 586 farms operated by\r\nthe owners, classified according to size:\r\n\r\n                 Number    Average\r\n                  of        size     Labor\r\n       Acres     farms    (acres)   income\r\n    30 or less    30        21       $168\r\n    31 to 60     108        49        254\r\n    61 to 100    214        83        373\r\n    101 to 150   143       124        436\r\n    151 to 200    57       177        635\r\n    over 200      34       261        946\r\n                          ----       ----\r\n    Average                103       $415\r\n\r\nWhile the larger the farm, the more prosperous was the operating owner\r\nor tenant, the size of the farm did not seem to affect the profit of\r\nthe landlord.\r\n\r\nThe amount of land one individual may own is unlimited; the size of\r\nthe farm unit is limited. After a farm unit has reached a certain\r\nsize, depending upon the type of farming, the general arrangement of\r\nthe farm and the skill in management, any further increase will\r\nincrease the cost of operation, and as the increase continues\r\neventually cause a decrease in profits. Assuming this to be true, it\r\nfollows as a mathematical necessity that as the farm increases in size\r\nthe total profits will increase as the farm increases up to a given\r\npoint and then the profits will decrease. The following table\r\nillustrates this law:\r\n\r\n    Size of              A                        B\r\n    farm      Net profit   Net profit   Net Profit   Net Profit\r\n    acres     per acre     per farm     per acre     per farm\r\n    160         $5.00        $800         $5.00        $800\r\n    200          4.50         900          4.75         950\r\n    240          4.00         960          4.50       1,080\r\n    280          3.50         980          4.25       1,190\r\n    320          3.00         960          4.00       1,280\r\n    360          2.50         900          3.75       1,350\r\n    400          2.00         800          3.50       1,400\r\n    440          1.50         660          3.25       1,430\r\n    480          1.00         480          3.00       1,440\r\n    520           .50         260          2.75       1,430\r\n    560           --          --           2.50       1,400\r\n\r\nIn both case A and case B it is assumed that the greatest net profit\r\nper acre is to be obtained with 160 acres, and that the net profit per\r\nacre when the farm is of that size is $5. In case A it is assumed that\r\nthe net profit would decrease $1 for each 80 acres added, while in\r\ncase B the decrease is assumed to be only one-half as rapid. In the\r\nfirst instance the net profit per farm increases until 280 acres are\r\nreached, when the net profit per farm decreases, until at 560 acres no\r\nprofit would be obtained. In case B the net profit per farm increases\r\nuntil 480 acres are reached. Everyone is cautioned not to accept these\r\nfigures as representing what would actually happen. All that can be\r\nsaid is that as the farm unit increases in size there will come a\r\npoint at which the net profit per acre will decrease because of the\r\nphysical difficulty of managing a large area, and, therefore, there is\r\na limit to the size of a single farm. Fifteen thousand acres may lay\r\nin one tract and be owned by one individual, firm or corporation, but\r\nits economic management requires for purely physical reasons, not to\r\nmention others, that it be managed in several units more or less\r\ndistinct from one another. Just what the size of this unit will be no\r\none knows and it will vary with the type of farming, the type of\r\nfarmer and many other circumstances. For example, a very common unit\r\nfor a tenant cotton farm is between 20 and 50 acres, both the product\r\nand the farmer being a limiting factor.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important lesson to be learned from a study of this\r\ntable is that it is wise for some men to operate a farm of 320 acres,\r\nothers of 160 acres and still others of 80 acres, because each size of\r\nfarm presents a task suited to different abilities. It would be as\r\nfutile for one fitted to operate only an 80-acre farm to attempt to\r\nmanage 320 acres as it would be unwise for the man capable of conducting\r\n320 acres to confine his attention to 80 acres. Unfortunately while this\r\nprinciple is not difficult to perceive and is easily stated, it is\r\npractically impossible to make any application of it to an individual\r\ncase. Only time and the inexorable laws of competition will adjust men\r\nto their several tasks.\r\n\r\nIt will be of interest to note what influence in actual practice the\r\ntype of farming has upon the size of the farm. The census reports the\r\naverage size of all farms in the United States as 147 acres, with the\r\ndifferent types as follows: Vegetables, 65 acres; fruits, 75 acres;\r\ndairy products, 120 acres; hay and grain, 159 acres; and live stock,\r\n227 acres. Speaking in a very general way, only about one-half the\r\nland on these farms is in cultivated crops, while only 40% of the\r\nincome may be from the products which cause the farm to be thus\r\nclassified. The young farmer will do well to have these figures in\r\nmind when he starts out in life, for while they are not to be followed\r\nliterally, they give him a measuring stick with which to compare his\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                          SELECTION OF FARM\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving some of these preliminary questions settled, or at least well\r\nin mind, the young farmer is ready to inspect individual farms with a\r\nview to purchasing or renting. He should examine each farm from four\r\ngeneral aspects, namely: (1) The character and topography of the soil,\r\n(2) the climatic conditions, including healthfulness and water supply,\r\n(3) the location, and (4) the improvements.\r\n\r\nIt may be well at the outset to emphasize the advantage which even a\r\nsmall difference in fertility may bring. Suppose one farm is capable\r\nof raising fifteen bushels of wheat per acre and another twenty\r\nbushels. If wheat is 80 cents a bushel, then the gross income is $12\r\nand $16 respectively. If it is assumed that it costs in either case\r\nfor seed, labor and interest on investment $8 an acre to raise and\r\nharvest the crop, then it will be seen that an increase of five\r\nbushels an acre doubles the profit. The comparison is perhaps not\r\nquite fair, since it costs slightly more to harvest the larger crop,\r\nbut it serves to illustrate the point.\r\n\r\nNeither the crop adaptation nor the crop-producing power of the soil\r\ncan be determined by taking a sample and submitting it to a chemist\r\nfor analysis. These factors can best be determined by the character of\r\nthe vegetation, both domestic and wild, and by a knowledge obtained\r\nthrough observation or reading as to what this particular soil type\r\nusually does. Every type of soil has certain characteristics which\r\nunder like conditions it may be expected to reproduce, much in the\r\nsame manner as each species of animal reproduces its characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe first essential is to be able to recognize the different soil\r\ntypes. This can only be done by close observation and study. The second\r\nessential is to determine what the crop-producing characteristics of\r\nthese types of soil are. This knowledge may be obtained by personal\r\nobservation; but as most persons' opportunities are limited in this\r\ndirection, it should be supplemented wherever possible by a study of\r\nthe soil surveys of the United States Department of Agriculture\r\nwherever these are available. When this is not possible samples of soil\r\nmay be submitted to the Bureau of Soils of the United States Department\r\nof Agriculture or to the soil division of the state experiment station,\r\ntogether with a suitable description and such knowledge of the history\r\nof the land as is obtainable. In this way you may obtain information as\r\nto the natural adaptation of the particular type of soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Walter S. Tomlinson, Bryan, Ohio, began thirteen years\r\nago with 225 acres, partly rented, to determine whether a farm could be\r\nmade a satisfying enterprise. As tenant he has paid to himself as\r\nlandlord $1,000 each year for rental and $500 each year as salary. The\r\nrest of the profits have been invested in 240 acres of additional land\r\nand in improvements. Mr. Tomlinson's specialty has been hogs, but he\r\nsays it does not matter so much about the lines one adopts as the\r\nattention that is given them.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dr. W. I. Chamberlain, Hudson, Ohio, graduate of Western\r\nReserve University, former state secretary of agriculture, later college\r\npresident. Farmer and institute lecturer and widely known for his\r\neditorial work on farm journals; has been able, amid his other\r\nactivities, to manage his farm of 116 acres. The net cash income above\r\nall expenses from the farm for 1890 to 1907 was $113,966 or $1,370 per\r\nyear. Of this income $8,877 were obtained from a ten-acre apple orchard.]\r\n\r\nThere will still remain the question of the present condition of the\r\nland. For example, the Pennsylvania station obtained in a certain\r\nseason 42 loads of hay from nine acres of land. The same season, from\r\nexactly the same soil type, the station obtained eight loads of hay\r\nfrom 20 acres. The condition of the soil was different, which the\r\nprevious history of the two tracts of land fully explains.\r\n\r\nIt is of the utmost importance, therefore, to distinguish between the\r\nnatural fertility of the soil and the condition of the soil. A further\r\nexample will help to illustrate this point. At the Rothamsted Station\r\na certain type of soil has for over 60 years produced annually about\r\n12 bushels of wheat an acre without fertilizer, while with a complete\r\nfertilizer the same type has produced 30 or more bushels. The 12\r\nbushels may be said to represent the natural fertility of the soil,\r\nwhile the additional 18 bushels may be said to represent the condition\r\nof the soil due to fertilizers or to other conditions. On the other\r\nhand, the natural condition of some other soil type might be only\r\neight bushels, or still another type might be 16 bushels.\r\n\r\nThis principle is of considerable practical importance, especially in\r\nthe eastern third of the United States. Generally speaking, clay and\r\nsilt soils have a greater natural fertility than sandy soils;\r\nlimestone soils than those that are deficient in lime. Thus soils that\r\nnaturally grow chestnut trees, indicating a low lime content, have a\r\ntendency to deteriorate under exhaustive cropping much more rapidly\r\nthan limestone soils. More fertilizers and other methods of soil\r\nimprovement are necessary in the case of chestnut soils than in the\r\ncase of limestone valley soils. One of the first questions to ask,\r\ntherefore, concerning an unknown farm in Pennsylvania is whether or\r\nnot chestnut trees grow naturally. It does not follow, however, that\r\nchestnut soils are undesirable. Much will depend upon the crop or\r\ncrops it is desired to raise. For example, in some regions they are\r\nwell adapted to potatoes and peaches. In these cases the cost of the\r\nfertilizers necessary to keep the soil in proper condition is small\r\ncompared with the total return from the crop.\r\n\r\nThe pioneer's best guide as to the value of new land was and is the\r\nvegetation growing upon it, and, especially in a wooded country, the\r\nnative trees. Basswood, crab apple, wild plum, black walnut, ash,\r\nhickory and hard maple generally indicate a fertile soil. White oak\r\nindicates only a moderate soil; bur oak, a somewhat warmer and better\r\ndrained soil. Beech indicates a rather poor soil; a heavy clay,\r\nlacking in organic matter. Certain species of elms, maples and oaks,\r\nas red maple and the Spanish swamp oak, indicate wet soils.\r\n\r\nThe occurrence and vigor of certain herbaceous plants are especially\r\nindicative of fertility of the soil, as, for example, ragweed,\r\nbindweed, certain plants of the sunflower family, such as goldenrod,\r\nasters and wild sunflowers. Soils adapted to red clover and alfalfa are\r\nusually well drained and contain plenty of lime. Alsike clover will\r\ngrow on a soil too wet or containing too little lime for either of the\r\nformer. Soils that produce sorrel and redtop when red clover and\r\ntimothy are sown need drainage or liming or both. Sedges usually\r\nindicate a wet soil, although certain species grow on dry, sandy soils.\r\nThe point of this paragraph, however, is not to give comprehensive\r\nadvice but to cause the young farmer to observe the conditions and make\r\nhis own applications, which will vary in different regions and under\r\ndifferent circumstances.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the one feature that the young farmer is most likely to\r\noverlook in the selection of a farm is the relative proportion of\r\ntillable land. One farm of 200 acres, may, on account of stony land,\r\nwet land, comparatively unproductive woodland, or because of the\r\narrangement of fences and roadways, contain only eighty acres of\r\ntillable land, while another may contain 160 acres. This is one reason\r\nwhy a 160-acre farm in the central West may be more valuable than a\r\nfarm of the same size in the northeastern United States.\r\n\r\nColumella says with regard to the selection of land that there are two\r\nthings chiefly to be considered, the wholesomeness of the air and the\r\nfruitfulness of the place, \"of which if either the one or the other\r\nshould be wanting, and notwithstanding anyone should have a mind to\r\ndwell there, he must have lost his senses and ought to be conveyed to\r\nhis kinfolk to take care of him.\"\r\n\r\nIn selecting a farm do not fail to inquire whether there has been any\r\nrecent illness, and if so the nature of it, either among the persons\r\nliving there or the domestic animals kept.\r\n\r\nAside from healthfulness, climate is a fundamental and controlling\r\nfactor, both in productiveness and economic farm management.\r\nTemperature and rainfall affect the number of days that work can be\r\nperformed upon the land and hence affect materially the economy of\r\nlabor. It is this fact that prevents the systematic organization of\r\nlabor so common in manufacturing and transportation. The climate also\r\naffects the cost of producing live stock by modifying the food and\r\nshelter required.\r\n\r\nThe climate of a region is best studied from the reports of the United\r\nStates Weather Bureau rather than from the statements published by\r\ninterested parties. So far as the production of crops is concerned the\r\ndistribution of rainfall is more important than the annual amount, as\r\nmay be shown by comparing the rainfall in such places as Columbus,\r\nOhio, and Lincoln, Nebraska.\r\n\r\nThe average temperature during the growing season is, of course, of\r\nmore importance from the standpoint of crop production than the\r\naverage annual temperature. Maximum and minimum temperatures or the\r\nrange of temperature must be considered as well as the average\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nOne of the most practical questions to determine is the average date\r\nof the last killing frost in the spring and the date of the first\r\nkilling frost in the autumn; in other words, the length of the growing\r\nseason. Both altitude and topography enter into this problem. In a\r\ngiven locality killing frosts will occur on a still night in the\r\nvalley before they do on the elevations, because the air as it cools\r\nbecomes heavier and flows down into the lowest places just as water\r\nwould do. On the other hand, as the altitude increases the growing\r\nseason shortens.\r\n\r\nWhenever I am asked a question involving the production of farm crops\r\nby a Pennsylvania farmer before answering, I ask three questions: (1)\r\nWhere are you located? (2) Do chestnut trees grow naturally upon your\r\nland? (3) What is your altitude?\r\n\r\nOne factor that is often overlooked by the young farmer needs only to\r\nbe mentioned to be thoroughly appreciated. It is the amount and\r\ncharacter of the water supply. Not only is this of the utmost\r\nimportance from the standpoint of the household, but it is fundamental\r\nto the best farm management. Thus, if the water supply is limited the\r\namount of live stock kept will be curtailed, and thus the proper\r\nutilization of farm products prevented and maintenance of the\r\nfertility of the soil made more difficult.\r\n\r\nThe young farmer should recognize that some kinds of farming are more\r\ndependent upon the climatic conditions than others and should,\r\ntherefore, select the location best suited to the type of farming\r\ndesired or else modify his type of farming to suit the climatic\r\nconditions. If one studies critically the types of farming in various\r\nparts of the United States, it will be seen that they have already\r\nbeen adjusted in large degree, either consciously or unconsciously, to\r\nthe climatic conditions. The young farmer should be careful that he\r\ndoes not undertake to butt his head against a stone wall.\r\n\r\nHaving found a farm that suits our ideal as to the natural conditions,\r\nsuch as the crop adaptation, fertility, topography and climate, what\r\nmay be called the artificial conditions must be studied.\r\n\r\nThe location may be studied, both as to local and distant markets and\r\nthe means of reaching each, which includes roadways and shipping\r\nfacilities. Here again much will depend upon the products which are to\r\nbe sold. The man who raises tobacco, hogs or beef cattle does not\r\nsuffer any great economic disadvantage by living ten miles from a\r\nshipping station, but a man does who produces milk, peaches, potatoes\r\nor hay.\r\n\r\nIn these days there is not much danger that the character of the\r\nroadway will be overlooked by the intending purchaser of the farm,\r\nalthough sufficient importance may not be given to the advantage of\r\nreally good roads, both as to grade and surface. Perhaps the one most\r\nimportant question to consider in connection with the transportation\r\nfacilities is whether products may be shipped without change from the\r\nshipping station to the market it is desired to reach.\r\n\r\nAlthough at first glance we may not like the thought, it must be\r\nconceded that neighbors are not only important morally and socially,\r\nbut they also may have economic advantages and disadvantages. While it\r\nmay sometimes happen that it will be wise to raise in a given\r\nneighborhood some product that no one else has undertaken to supply,\r\nyet as a rule, if a given neighborhood is raising Jersey, or Guernsey\r\nor Holstein cattle or Chester White, Berkshire or Poland China hogs,\r\nor Southdown or Shropshire or Cotswold sheep, it will be wise to raise\r\nthe breed commonly raised instead of the least commonly raised breed,\r\nas it is sometimes supposed. The more potato growers or cabbage\r\ngrowers or celery raisers or orchardists in a locality the better for\r\nall concerned, for a number of reasons, among which may be mentioned\r\n(1) the more and the better the products raised the more buyers will\r\nseek the region and hence the higher will be the price obtained for\r\nthe product; (2) the more of a given product there is to ship the\r\nbetter the shipping facilities for that product are likely to be; (3)\r\nall the necessary supplies for the type of farming can be more readily\r\nand cheaply obtained; (4) there will be a better knowledge of the\r\nbusiness when more men have had experience in raising the particular\r\ncrop.\r\n\r\nThese principles apply in all classes of business; thus we find woolen\r\nfactories in Philadelphia, silk factories at Paterson, N. J., cotton\r\nfactories at Lowell, Mass., plow factories at Moline, Ill., and steel\r\nmills at Pittsburg. Many of these centers possessed originally some\r\nnatural advantages which caused the location of the first factory, but\r\nothers have been drawn there on account of the principles enunciated.\r\nThe farmers of a given region have a community of interest as well as\r\nrailroads. The young farmer should recognize this fact and if\r\nnecessary should exert himself to develop such interest in his\r\ncommunity, both for his own benefit and that of his neighbors.\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of farms for which the purchaser is in danger of\r\npaying too much, one on which there are extensive improvements and one\r\non which there are none at all. A farm with just barely enough\r\nimprovements for the conduct of the type of farming it is proposed to\r\ndevelop can usually be purchased most advantageously. The purchaser\r\nshould understand clearly that the previous cost of the improvements\r\nhas no necessary relation to their present value, any more than the\r\nvalue of a second-hand suit of clothes is dependent upon its original\r\ncost. All depends on how badly they are worn and how well they are\r\nadapted to present conditions. The value of farm improvements is not\r\nunlike those in other business enterprises in this respect. Their\r\nvalue depends upon present and prospective earning capacity and not on\r\nformer cost.\r\n\r\nNo rule can be laid down as to the relation which should exist between\r\nthe value of land itself and the value of the improvements. In\r\npractice it varies greatly. In the United States the farm improvements\r\nconstitute on an average 21% of the total value of land, being as high\r\nas 45% in Massachusetts and as low as 15% in Texas. The young farmer\r\nmay well consider, therefore, whether he can earn interest on his\r\ninvestment when the improvements cost more than 25% of the total value\r\nof the real estate. Certainly when it becomes one-half it is\r\nexcessive. The man who runs a farm as an avocation usually errs in\r\nputting too much money into permanent improvements for the farm to be\r\na paying investment.\r\n\r\nIf it is admitted that the farm unit is limited because of the\r\nphysical difficulties of managing large areas, then it must at once be\r\nseen how important the arrangement of the farmsteading must be to the\r\nsuccessful conduct of the farm. In the older farming communities where\r\nthe present farm holdings are the result of several purchases or sales\r\nthe shape of the farm, the arrangement of the fields and the place of\r\nthe farm buildings become an extremely important matter. Sometimes\r\nsatisfactory rearrangements are easily made, at other times they are\r\nquite impossible. No attempt will be made to discuss this subject in\r\ndetail here, but the young farmer should bring to this question all\r\nthe experience and study possible.\r\n\r\nWhen the young farmer goes to inspect a farm it is to be assumed that\r\nhe will be conducted over the farm by the owner or his authorized\r\nagent. It is proper to give respectful attention to everything that is\r\ntold him, provided he follows carefully the California adage to\r\n\"believe nothing you hear and only one-half what you see.\"\r\n\r\nIf a farm consists of 200 or 300 acres of land, it is possible for the\r\nagent to convey the purchaser over the farm in such a way as to\r\nprevent the least desirable portions being seen. If the farm has\r\nattracted the seeker of land, he should not purchase until he has made\r\nanother visit, preferably some days or weeks after the first one. He\r\nmay then very properly visit the farm alone, passing over quite a\r\ndifferent course from that pursued hitherto. Sketches and notes will\r\nbe found very helpful, and if the use of the soil auger is understood\r\nit may be well employed to study the character of both soil and\r\nsubsoil. During the interval between visits some casual inquiries may\r\nbe made among those who know the history of the farm in question,\r\nbecause the past history of the farm obtained from unprejudiced\r\nwitnesses is of prime importance in arriving at a conclusion\r\nconcerning its value.\r\n\r\nA farm is much more attractive when a crop is growing upon it than\r\nwhen it is without active vegetation. Poor land looks relatively\r\nbetter than good land during or just after a rain. Many matters\r\nconcerning the selection of a farm can only be learned by some years\r\nof practical experience. The young farmer will do well, therefore, to\r\nsecure the help of some more experienced person. If he has among his\r\nacquaintances a successful farmer of mature years he will be fortunate\r\nif he can secure his advice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n                           THE FARM SCHEME\r\n\r\n\r\nFarming is no pink tea. It is a serious business. After the young\r\nfarmer has selected the farm he must develop his farm scheme. He must\r\ncontemplate well and seriously the philosophy which underlies his\r\nplans. Unless he sees clearly what he is striving to attain and unless\r\nhe understands the effect of his methods, he must fail in great\r\nmeasure to obtain his goal.\r\n\r\nSatisfactory results in farming cannot be obtained as a general\r\npractice if the man is only interested in the results of a single\r\nyear. For this reason the itinerant tenant system will not be\r\nsatisfactory unless the landlord has worked out a satisfactory scheme\r\nwhich he requires his tenant to follow.\r\n\r\nIt is not enough that a man shall grow a single large crop, but it is\r\nnecessary that he should continue to grow a satisfactory crop at least\r\nat regular intervals. For example, a piece of land may be adapted to\r\ncabbage, celery, potatoes or hay. Assume for the moment it is adapted\r\nto cabbage and that by one or more seasons of preparation an enormous\r\ncrop of cabbages may be secured. This fact is of little value unless\r\nsufficient quantity is raised and the process can be repeated\r\nannually. Cabbages cannot be grown again on this particular piece of\r\nland for from four to six years on account of club root. If the farmer\r\ndoes not have other areas which he can bring into cabbages year after\r\nyear, for from three to five years, then he becomes a failure as a\r\ncabbage raiser. Even a perennial, like alfalfa or asparagus, should\r\nform a part of the general scheme of crop production if the most\r\nsatisfactory results are to be obtained.\r\n\r\nThere are two general questions at the basis of all farm schemes: (1)\r\nHow to obtain a fairly uniform succession of cash products year after\r\nyear, and (2) how to keep up or improve the fertility of the soil\r\neconomically while doing so. In other words, how to keep the\r\ninvestment from decreasing while it is earning a satisfactory and\r\nfairly uniform income.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary, therefore, to consider what products are to be sold\r\nand what are simply subsidiary to the cash products. The cash products\r\nmay, of course, be soil products or animal products, but more likely\r\nthey will be both. When animals form a large part of the enterprise\r\nthe cropping system must be carefully adjusted to meet the needs of\r\nthese animals. Many apparently trivial details must be considered, as\r\nfor example, whether the cropping system furnishes too little or too\r\nmuch bedding for the live stock.\r\n\r\nIn considering profits the enterprise as a whole must be kept in view.\r\nFor example, if a man is producing milk, it may be cheaper, so far as\r\nthe production of milk is concerned, to allow the liquid excrement to\r\nrun to waste rather than to arrange for sufficient bedding. If,\r\nhowever, by using an abundance of bedding and saving all the\r\nhigh-priced nitrogen and the larger part of the potash in the manure,\r\nhe is able to raise twelve tons of silage in place of eight tons, or\r\nthree tons of hay in place of two tons, his enterprise as a whole will\r\nbe more profitable when he uses the extra amount of bedding, although\r\nso far as the production of a quart of milk is concerned the cost is\r\nincreased. It may be that by feeding corn to cattle or sheep one will\r\nobtain only 50 cents a bushel for his maize, while his neighbor is\r\nselling it to the elevator at 60 cents. If, however, the man who feeds\r\nhis maize year after year thereby raises 60 bushels instead of 40\r\nbushels, his enterprise, as a whole, may be more profitable than that\r\nof his neighbor.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, the Pennsylvania experiment station has\r\nsubstantially these two conditions in certain of its fertilizer plats.\r\nWhen for 25 years the conditions have been similar to those where\r\ncrops are sold from the farm, the yields have been: Maize, 42 bushels;\r\noats, 32 bushels; wheat, 14 bushels; and hay, 2,783 pounds per acre.\r\nBut when conditions exist which represent the feeding of corn, oats\r\nand hay and the return of manure to the soil, the yields have been:\r\nMaize, 58 bushels; oats, 41 bushels; wheat, 23 bushels; and hay 4,190\r\npounds per acre. In the first instance the value of the products has\r\nbeen $15.75 an acre, while in the other case it has been $22.90 an\r\nacre.\r\n\r\nHaving worked out a cropping system that gives the proper yearly\r\nproduction of several crops desired, the next question to decide is\r\nhow this cropping system and the disposition of the crops is going to\r\naffect the fertility of the soil. From a financial or economic point\r\nof view the most important soil element is nitrogen. First, because it\r\ncosts from 18 to 20 cents a pound, while phosphoric acid can be\r\npurchased at five cents, potash at four cents; and, second, because of\r\nthe readiness with which nitrogen may disappear from the soil under\r\nimproper management, either through nitrification and leaching or by\r\ndenitrification and passing back into the air.\r\n\r\nAssuming a given type of management, the question is, How much of the\r\nrequired nitrogen will be obtained from the legumes in the cropping\r\nsystem, how much from the manure, and how much must be purchased in\r\ncommercial fertilizers? No satisfactory cropping system can be devised\r\nat the present prices of farm products and cost of fertilizers for the\r\nproduction of the ordinary cereals and hay that does not include the\r\nproduction of some legume. Assuming a legume in the cropping scheme,\r\nthe fertility of the soil may be maintained by yard manure alone or by\r\ncommercial fertilizers alone. Illustrations of both methods are to be\r\nfound in actual practice. Generally speaking, however, the use of yard\r\nmanure supplemented with commercial fertilizers will be found more\r\nscientific and in the end the most economical.\r\n\r\nA factor entering into this problem will be the amount of purchased\r\nfeed. If considerable amounts of purchased feeds are used and the\r\nresulting manure carefully preserved and judiciously applied, the\r\ncommercial fertilizers required will be reduced to the minimum.\r\n\r\nA concrete illustration may bring out the philosophy underlying farm\r\nschemes better than abstract problems.\r\n\r\nThe following outline shows a five-course rotation with the method of\r\nfertilization which the results of the Pennsylvania Station indicated\r\nwould be advisable, at least on limestone soils in eastern United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n    1. Maize                yard manure, 8 tons per acre.\r\n    2. Oats                 nothing.\r\n    3. Wheat                acid phosphate, 350 lbs.\r\n                            muriate of potash, 100 lbs.\r\n    4. Clover and timothy   nothing.\r\n    5. Timothy              nitrate of soda, 150 lbs.\r\n                            acid phosphate, 150 lbs.\r\n                            muriate of potash, 50 lbs.\r\n\r\nThis rotation is suggested for the purpose of maintaining a farm that\r\nis already in a fairly fertile condition and one on which there is no\r\nconsiderable amount of purchased feed. Where concentrates are\r\npurchased liberally, yard manure should be available to use on the\r\ntimothy and meadow in place of the commercial fertilizers.\r\n\r\nWhere there is plenty of manure and it is desired to increase the\r\namount of maize and hay and reduce the amount of oats and wheat, the\r\nfollowing rotation and method of fertilization would be indicated:\r\n\r\n    1.  Maize                acid phosphate, 200 lbs.\r\n    2.  Maize                yard manure, 8 tons.\r\n    3.  Oats                 nothing.\r\n    4.  Wheat                acid phosphate, 350 lbs.\r\n                             muriate of potash, 100 lbs.\r\n    5.  Clover and timothy   nothing.\r\n    6.  Timothy              nitrate of soda, 150 lbs.\r\n                             acid phosphate, 150 lbs.\r\n                             muriate of potash, 50 lbs.\r\n    7.  Timothy              yard manure, 8 tons.\r\n\r\nWhere there is plenty of yard manure, it would be also applied to\r\nmaize under No. 1, or the yard manure could be applied to maize under\r\nNo. 1, and commercial fertilizer applied to timothy under No. 6 could\r\nbe repeated under No. 7. If the land is more or less depleted, an\r\napplication of 200 pounds of acid phosphate to the oats would be\r\nadvisable. However, the purpose is not to prescribe exact methods, but\r\nto point out underlying principles and their possible application.\r\n\r\nAs further illustration, it seems probable that the practice of a\r\nmarket gardener in using excessive amounts of stable manure might, in\r\nsome instances at least, be modified to good advantage by reducing the\r\namount of manure and increasing the amount of commercial fertilizer\r\nused. Unfortunately there is no experimental evidence bearing upon\r\nthis question.\r\n\r\nPotash required to maintain fertility is largely to be found in the\r\ncoarse fodder, such as hay, maize stover and silage, and in the straw\r\nused for bedding; hence where these substances are used in abundance\r\nand returned to the soil the amount of potash required to be supplied\r\nin fertilizers is reduced to a minimum. Where, however, the amount of\r\nlive stock is limited and the products sold contain large quantities\r\nof potash, such as hay and straw, the supply furnished in fertilizers\r\nmust be liberal.\r\n\r\nPhosphoric acid is always being slowly depleted from the soil either\r\nfrom the sale of farm crops or animal products. There is no way of\r\nreturning this loss completely, except from the addition of a\r\ncommercial fertilizer.\r\n\r\nThe above fertilizer suggestions are based on the experiments covering\r\na period of more than 25 years on a limestone soil. Soils may modify\r\nmaterially the amount and application of the fertilizers, but not the\r\nprinciples enunciated. For example, a soil on which common red clover\r\ngrows luxuriantly and has a prominent place in the farm scheme will\r\nrequire less nitrogen in commercial fertilizers in order to maintain\r\nthe fertility than where legumes are raised with difficulty or do not\r\nform a part of the farm scheme.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important points to be emphasized is the fact that\r\nhaphazard fertilization is not effective in maintaining soil\r\nfertility. If one starts out to establish a five-course rotation and\r\nbuild up his soil through a rational system of fertilization, he will\r\nobviously not obtain the full benefit of the rotation until he begins\r\nto get crops from the second round, which will be the sixth year from\r\nthe beginning. It may happen, and unfortunately it has perhaps usually\r\nhappened in the past, that during the first rotation the increase in\r\ncrops has not paid for the cost of the fertilizers applied. In many\r\ninstances a rational system of fertilization has not been introduced\r\nbecause the owner of the land could not afford to wait six years for\r\nhis return. Profit in farming, therefore, does not consist in raising\r\none big crop or even in obtaining a large balance on the right side of\r\nthe ledger in a single year. It is both interesting and valuable to\r\nknow that five tons of timothy hay, 45 bushels of wheat, 100 bushels\r\nof maize and 40 tons of cabbage may be raised on an acre, but the real\r\nprofit in farming only comes through a lifetime of effort. To the man\r\nof capacity who prepares for his work the results will surely come,\r\nbut they will not come all at once and, as in every other business, he\r\nmust pay the price in hard work and close application to details.\r\n\r\nIn this connection it may be emphasized that one of the difficulties\r\nin successful farming is to find one man both interested and capable\r\nalong the various lines essential to a successful farm enterprise. The\r\ndanger is that a man will ride his hobby to the detriment of the other\r\nactivities of the farm. A farmer friend of the writer, who keeps a\r\nhorse and buggy, cares so little for a horse that for several years he\r\nhas walked two miles each morning and each evening rather than to take\r\nthe trouble to hitch up his horse. If one visits a high-grade breeder\r\nof dairy cattle, he is very apt to find his pigs of ordinary\r\ncharacter. On the other hand, a specialist in hogs is likely to keep\r\nscrub cows. A man may be an excellent wheat raiser and a poor potato\r\ngrower, and the reverse. The breeder of live stock is likely to be\r\nlacking in his methods of producing farm crops, while the up-to-date,\r\nso-called general farmer is not likely to be a special lover of live\r\nstock. In like manner, the man may be a successful farmer, dairyman or\r\nhorticulturist from the producing side, but be a poor salesman. In\r\nfact, those qualities of mind and heart which make for the best\r\nsuccess from the standpoint of production, whether soil products or\r\nanimal products, is not that which makes the best trader.\r\n\r\nIt is not expected that the young farmer will be materially different\r\nfrom his hundreds of thousands of predecessors, but the better a man\r\nis trained and the more fully he studies his own adaptabilities and\r\ndeficiencies, the more likely he is to succeed in the open country.\r\nFor this reason, the young man should be careful to get as broad a\r\ntraining as possible. It is, therefore, often more important for him\r\nto study those things which he dislikes than to study the things for\r\nwhich he has a natural taste.\r\n\r\n             There was a man in our town\r\n               And he was wondrous wise.\r\n             He knew that if he wanted crops\r\n               He'd have to fertilize.\r\n\r\n             \"Its nitrogen that makes things green,\"\r\n               Said this man of active brain;\r\n             \"And potash makes the good strong straw,\r\n               And phosphate plumps the grain.\r\n             But it's clearly wrong to waste plant food\r\n               On a wet and soggy field;\r\n             I'll surely have to put in drains\r\n               If I'd increase the yield.\r\n\r\n             \"And after I have drained the land\r\n               I must plow it deep all over;\r\n             And even then I'll not succeed\r\n               Unless it will grow clover.\r\n             Now, acid soils will not produce\r\n               A clover sod that's prime;\r\n             So if I have a sour soil,\r\n               I'll have to put on lime.\r\n\r\n             \"And after doing all these things,\r\n               To make success more sure,\r\n             I'll try my very best to keep\r\n               From wasting the manure.\r\n             So I'll drain, and lime, and cultivate,\r\n               With all that that implies;\r\n             And when I've done that thoroughly\r\n               I'll manure and fertilize.\"\r\n                                               _Vivian_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n                        THE ROTATION OF CROPS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe two essential reasons for a rotation of crops are: (1) The\r\npossibility of obtaining for the soil a supply of nitrogen from the\r\nair by introducing a legume at regular intervals, and (2) the\r\nprevention of injury to the crops from fungous diseases, insect\r\nenemies, weeds or other causes. Other reasons are often advanced, some\r\nof which are entirely erroneous, while others are of quite secondary\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\nThe rotation should be carefully studied with reference to the farm\r\nscheme as previously outlined. Reasons for modifying the rotations are:\r\n(1) To change the kind or proportion of crops grown, (2) to change the\r\namount of labor required, or (3) to increase the crop-producing power\r\nof the soil.\r\n\r\nDuring 25 years the four crops of maize, oats, wheat, timothy and\r\nclover hay have been taken in rotation from the four tiers of plats at\r\nthe Pennsylvania State College, so that the influence of the soil has\r\nbeen entirely eliminated. At the December farm prices for the decade\r\nending December 1, 1906, the value of these four crops per acre have\r\nbeen: Maize, $29.67; oats, $14.49; wheat, $18.49; and hay, $18.05. It\r\nwill be noted that during 25 years the average income from an acre of\r\nmaize has been almost exactly twice that from an acre of oats. The\r\nregion where these results were obtained is relatively unfavorable to a\r\nlarge yield of maize. It is obvious, therefore, that a modification in\r\nthe rotation may modify the average income from the farm materially,\r\nprovided such modification does not reduce the fertility of the soil.\r\nThus, while the average income per acre during 25 years for the\r\nfour-course rotation above mentioned was $20.17, if the rotation were\r\nincreased to a five-course rotation by the addition of another year of\r\nmaize, the average income would be $22.45 an acre.\r\n\r\nIt may be desirable to modify the rotation in order to increase or\r\ndecrease a certain crop usually fed upon the farm. Thus, with a\r\nfour-course rotation of maize, oats, wheat, clover and timothy,\r\none-fourth the area would produce hay; while with a six-course\r\nrotation, composed of maize, oats, wheat, each one year, and hay three\r\nyears, one-half the area would produce hay. If it is desired to still\r\nfurther reduce the area in oats and wheat, a seven-course rotation\r\ncould be arranged with maize, two years in succession. This is the\r\nrotation that would be desirable for a dairy farm where it is planned\r\nto keep as many cows as practicable and to buy the concentrates\r\nlargely. Either the wheat or the oats could be taken out of this\r\nrotation if either the one or the other were thought undesirable and a\r\nstill greater amount of roughage desired.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are places where the minimum amount of\r\nroughage is wanted. There are certain sections of the central West\r\nwhere it is possible to sow oats on corn stubble without plowing and\r\nwhere occasionally a rotation is practiced of maize, oats and mammoth\r\nclover. The clover is plowed for maize, the oats are disked in upon\r\nthe corn stubble and the next year the clover is pastured until about\r\nJune 1, when it is allowed to go to seed. In this rotation the only\r\nroughage obtained is the corn stover and the oat straw.\r\n\r\nAnother result reached by this rotation is that only one-third the\r\nland is plowed annually. In the four-course rotation mentioned above\r\nthree-fourths of the land must be plowed, while in the six-course\r\nrotation one-half is plowed each year. In other ways the character of\r\nthe rotation modifies the labor. For example, the labor and cost of\r\nharvesting an acre of hay is much less than that of producing,\r\nharvesting and threshing an acre of wheat.\r\n\r\nRotations may often be planned with reference to the main or cash\r\ncrop. Thus in the Aroostook (Maine) potato district the rotation is\r\npotatoes, oats and clover. The chief purpose of the oats and clover is\r\nto keep down the blight in potatoes and add through the clover\r\nnitrogen and organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nA system of cropping that is best when the owner operates the farm may\r\nnot be desirable when the farmer is a tenant. When a farm is rented,\r\nthe lease should provide that clover or other legumes occur with\r\nsufficient frequency to keep up the supply of nitrogen without the\r\npurchase of a considerable quantity in chemical fertilizers. The lease\r\nshould be so drawn as to make it necessary for the tenant to keep live\r\nstock in order to realize the largest profit. The landlord should\r\nprovide an equitable proportion of the mineral fertilizers when such\r\nare required.\r\n\r\nThe provisions of the lease and the character of the rotation will\r\nnecessarily vary with circumstances, but the following system of\r\ntenant farming which has been employed for many years in Maryland will\r\nillustrate the principles just stated:\r\n\r\nThe lease provides for a five-course rotation consisting of maize,\r\nwheat, clover, wheat, clover. The landlord and the tenant share the\r\nmaize and wheat equally, but the clover for hay or pasture goes\r\nentirely to the tenant, unless hay is sold, when it is divided\r\nequally. They each provide one-half the commercial fertilizer and\r\none-half the seed, except clover seed, which the tenant is required to\r\nfurnish.\r\n\r\nThis lease provides for two clover crops out of every five crops\r\nraised, thus supplying nitrogen abundantly, and the terms of the lease\r\nare such that it is necessary for the tenant to keep live stock to\r\nconsume these clover crops in order to secure the most profitable\r\nreturns. The feeding of the clover makes it necessary to feed some or\r\nall the maize and may lead to buying additional concentrates.\r\n\r\nStable manure is thereby supplied for the field which is to raise\r\nmaize, while mineral fertilizers may be applied to the fields sown to\r\nwheat. On the limestone soils of the eastern states 50 pounds each of\r\nphosphoric acid and potash per acre applied to the wheat, and 10 loads\r\nof stable manure per acre to the maize will probably be found\r\nsufficient to maintain the crop producing power of the soil.\r\n\r\nIn laying out a farm for a rotation it is desirable to plan the number\r\nof fields or tracts that will go in a rotation and try to get these as\r\nnearly equal size as possible. Having decided upon the number of years\r\nthe rotation is to run and having adjusted the fields or tracts\r\naccordingly, it is quite possible to modify the proportion of crops by\r\nadding one crop and dropping another at the same time. Thus, if there\r\nare six 20-acre fields, any one of the following rotations might be\r\nused and the change from one to another easily made:\r\n\r\n    1. Maize        Maize       Maize        Maize        Maize\r\n    2. Oats         Maize       Maize        Maize        Barley\r\n    3. Wheat        Oats        Oats         Wheat        Alfalfa\r\n    4. Clover and   Wheat       Clover and   Clover and   Alfalfa\r\n         timothy                  timothy      timothy\r\n    5. Timothy      Clover and  Timothy      Timothy      Alfalfa\r\n                      timothy\r\n    6. Timothy      Timothy     Timothy      Timothy      Alfalfa\r\n\r\nDuring the first year the 20-acre field could be divided into four\r\ntracts of five acres each, containing potatoes, cabbage, tomatoes and\r\nsweet corn, and then followed for four or five years by any succession\r\nof crops above outlined. The point is that a definite adjustment of\r\nthe farm to some general method of rotation and a definite system of\r\nfertilization and soil renovation do not prevent a considerable\r\nlatitude in the crops raised. It will be obvious that the longer the\r\nrotation the more flexible it becomes in this particular, which is a\r\npoint to be considered in laying out the farm and in adjusting fields\r\nand fences.\r\n\r\nIn some cases it may be desirable on account of the arrangement of the\r\nfarm or the character of the crops to be raised to have two distinct\r\nrotations of crops. For example, if the farm lends itself to be\r\ndivided into eight tracts, a five-course rotation of maize, oats,\r\nwheat, each one year, and clover and timothy two years, and a\r\nthree-course rotation of potatoes, oats or wheat and clover may be\r\narranged.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER X\r\n\r\n                            THE EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe workman is known by his tools. The problem of obtaining the most\r\nefficient machinery for the conduct of the farm without having an\r\nexcessive amount is not easy of solution.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the cost of maintaining machinery and tools is not\r\nless than 15%, 10% for upkeep and 5% for interest, even under the most\r\ncareful management. Doubtless in practice it is as much as 25%. If\r\nthis is conceded there must be a limit to the amount which may be\r\neconomically invested in equipment. This is a place where the lead\r\npencil may be used profitably. For example, if $125 is invested in a\r\nself-binder, the annual cost of the machine at 15% will be $18.75. If\r\none has but 15 acres of grain to harvest, it may be better to hire a\r\nself-binder at $1 an acre. On the other hand, it may be necessary to\r\nown a self-binder in order to get the grain harvested at the proper\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAmong the machines requiring a considerable investment for the number\r\nof days used may be mentioned hay loaders, hay tedders, corn-binding\r\nharvesters and lime spreaders. There is a certain class of labor-saving\r\ndevices, however, for which there is more or less constant need, as,\r\nfor example, means of pumping water, methods of handling manure, both\r\nfrom the stable to the manure shed, and from the manure shed to the\r\nfield. This leads to the remark that there is at present great need of\r\nmodifying our traditional ideas concerning farm barns. Why do persons\r\nusually sleep on the second floor, while horses and cattle are placed\r\nin the basement? Three things have brought about the need of a radical\r\nrevision of our practices concerning the planning of barns: (1) Our\r\npresent knowledge of the difference in the function of food in keeping\r\nthe animal warm, and that of producing work, flesh or milk; (2) the\r\ndiscovery of the bacillus of tuberculosis; and (3) the invention of the\r\nhay carrier. It is not the purpose here to discuss barn buildings, but\r\nmerely to call attention to the fact that the traditional barn has long\r\nsince outlived its usefulness, and that the young farmer should plan\r\nhis farm buildings to serve the purposes required in the light of\r\nmodern knowledge.\r\n\r\nVarious attempts have been made to manufacture combined machines; that\r\nis, a machine which, by an interchange of parts or other modification,\r\nmay be used for two or more purposes, as, for example, harvesting\r\nsmall grain and cutting grass. Such attempts have usually been\r\nunsuccessful. On the other hand, the young farmer should consider the\r\nrange of usefulness of any given type of machine or tool; thus, a disk\r\nharrow is more efficient for some purposes than a spring-tooth harrow.\r\nFor other purposes the spike-tooth harrow is better than the spring\r\ntooth. The spring-tooth harrow, however, will do fairly well wherever\r\nthe disk harrow or the spike-tooth harrow is needed. When, therefore,\r\nonly one of these tools can be afforded, the spring tooth may be a\r\nbetter tool to buy than either the disk or the spike-tooth, although\r\nit is not for certain purposes as efficient as either of the others.\r\n\r\nThe kind of machine should obviously be adjusted to the conditions,\r\nas, for example, the size of the farm, and the character of the\r\nfarming. Riding plows may be desirable on level land, but where it is\r\nnecessary to plow up and down hill, walking plows should be used. The\r\nextra weight of the wheel plow is not a serious matter on level land,\r\nbecause the sliding friction has been transferred to rolling friction,\r\nbut no mechanical device has been or can be invented which will\r\ndecrease the power necessary to raise a given weight a given height.\r\nThe various machines requiring horse power should be adjusted, as far\r\nas possible, to require the same number of horses. If the main unit is\r\nthree horses, then, as far as possible, all machines should require\r\nthree horses, such as plows, harrows, manure spreaders, harvesters,\r\netc. If the activities of the farm are sufficient to require six\r\nhorses then some of the tools may require three horses each, while\r\nothers require a pair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. R. H. Garrahan, Kingston, Pa., is one of the most\r\nsuccessful growers of celery in the United States. After graduating from\r\nthe Wyoming Seminary he spent one year studying horticulture at the\r\nPennsylvania State College. For several years he was assistant in\r\nhorticulture at the University of Tennessee. He now has at Kingston 60\r\nacres under intensive cultivation. His principal crops are celery,\r\nasparagus, cabbage, tomatoes and onions.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H. H. Richardson, Brooklyn Heights, Ohio, agricultural\r\ngraduate, Ohio State University, 1892. Fourteen years ago inherited 35\r\nacres of land and an indebtedness of $1,750. He has raised a family of\r\nfour children, has what is seen in the picture plus the land and $6,000\r\ninvested elsewhere. Mr. Richardson has held some local public office\r\ncontinuously during the past ten years, being at present member of school\r\nand water boards, member of advisory board of bank, secretary of\r\nCleveland Fruit and Vegetable Growers' Association and Ohio\r\nvice-president of the National Vegetable Growers' Association.]\r\n\r\nA farm with six work horses is rather a desirable one from several\r\naspects. Among other things, it enables the farm owner to employ two\r\nmen who can perform most of the team work with two three-horse teams,\r\nwhile at other times three pairs of horses may be arranged when the\r\nowner needs to use a team. This leaves the farmer time to attend to\r\nmany activities not requiring horses, and time to plan the work and to\r\nlook with more care after the purchases and sales. The size of such a\r\nfarm will depend entirely on the nature of the activities. If it is a\r\nso-called general farm with a minimum of live stock, it would,\r\nperhaps, consist of from 150 to 180 acres of tillable land with some\r\nadditional pasture and woodland. Ideally, every farm should have\r\nsufficient activity to make it something of a center. It should be an\r\norganism. It is difficult to organize one man.\r\n\r\nIt will be useful, when we come to discuss how profits may be\r\nestimated, to divide the capital into three general groups: (1) The\r\nplant, which in addition to the real estate, will include the machines\r\nand tools, horses used for labor, and other animals used for breeding\r\npurposes or for the production of animal products, such as butter,\r\nwool or eggs; (2) materials, which will include animals which are to\r\nbe fattened for sale, and all seeds, fertilizers and foods intended to\r\nbe turned into products to be sold; (3) supplies, which may include\r\nfoods for teams, and money with which to pay labor, be this labor that\r\nof the farmer or his employees.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this classification is to bring sharply into view the\r\nfact that the nature of different kinds of equipment varies. All the\r\nthings named under the plant are in the nature of an annual charge\r\nagainst income. The charge under materials may or may not be an annual\r\ncharge. If a man invests $2,000 in 50 head of cattle, which he intends\r\nto feed and sell for $3,250 at the end of one hundred days, he does\r\nnot have to calculate interest on $2,000 for a year, but only for 100\r\ndays. Cattle paper is held in large quantities by banks in the cattle\r\nfeeding districts of the United States. The farmer would, in fact, be\r\nunwise to keep $2,000 in the bank nine months in the year in order to\r\nuse it three months. Like any other business man, if he has the money,\r\nhe invests it and borrows the money to buy his cattle. The same thing\r\napplies to food and fertilizers. If the food is fed to cattle, some of\r\nthe money invested in the food must pay interest during the fattening\r\nperiod. Food fed to dairy cattle and chickens may be paid for out of\r\neach day's income. In practice, the amount of money invested in food\r\nfor dairy cattle and chickens is dependent only upon the most\r\neconomical unit of purchase. One may apply fertilizers to buckwheat,\r\ngive a three months' note for the fertilizer, and pay the note out of\r\nthe proceeds of the crop. If the fertilizer is applied to one-year-old\r\napple trees, this investment may be required to pay interest for\r\nfifteen years.\r\n\r\nThe same principle applies to supplies. If one starts into raising\r\nhorses for sale, he needs to have some money or other income on which\r\nhis laborers and his own family can live, say for five years, this\r\nbeing the age at which a horse is supposed to become salable. More\r\npeople would raise apples and horses if they could afford to wait for\r\nthe return on the investment.\r\n\r\nWhile this is a serious handicap, it is an advantage to the man who\r\narranges his farming methods so that he can secure an income from some\r\nother source in the interim. The young farmer will do wisely to so\r\narrange his farm methods that a portion, perhaps the major portion of\r\nhis farm, will give him quick returns while making some long-time\r\ninvestments, which later in life will give him a greater return\r\nbecause so few people are sufficiently forehanded to make them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n                       HOW TO ESTIMATE PROFITS\r\n\r\n\r\nNo man who engages in manufacturing or merchandising knows how much he\r\nis going to make annually during life. Much less does he know how much\r\nhe will be worth when he dies. Neither does the man who works for a\r\nsalary or practices some profession for fees know what his annual\r\nincome will be even during the following decade. Neither one nor the\r\nother knows whether he will die a millionaire or a pauper. It is a\r\nproblem too complex for any human mind to analyze. It is less certain\r\nthan what the weather will be on this day next year, because it is the\r\nresultant of more variable factors.\r\n\r\nIn some respects there is more hazard in farming than in manufacturing\r\nor in merchandising, while in other respects there is much less. The\r\nprofit which may be obtained from farming is neither easier nor more\r\ndifficult to estimate than is that of other commercial enterprises.\r\nHowever, there is no business in which more foolish estimates are made\r\nas to the probable profits, except, perhaps, in mining.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this chapter is not to give advice as to possible or\r\nprobable profits, but rather to point out the general character of the\r\ndata required for any individual problem, where the data may be\r\nobtained and how it may be applied.\r\n\r\nThere are two forms or methods of stating the financial gain that has\r\nbeen obtained from farming or other business ventures during a year or\r\nother specific period. The first may be called the interest on the\r\ninvestment method, and the second the labor income method.\r\n\r\nWith the interest on the investment method, all expenses may be\r\nsubtracted from all the sales. From the cash balance thus obtained the\r\nincrease or decrease in inventory may be added or subtracted. This\r\nbalance may then be divided by the capital invested, to determine the\r\nrate of interest received.\r\n\r\nThe rate of interest method is the usual method in the commercial\r\nworld. The prosperity of the railroad or industrial concern is judged\r\nby the rate of interest it pays its stockholders on the par value of\r\nthe stock. The stock itself takes on the capitalization in accordance\r\nwith the present and prospective dividends. The fact that this method\r\nis generally used in the commercial world is evidence that it is well\r\nsuited to its needs.\r\n\r\nThe young farmer who wishes to know whether the operation of a given\r\ntract of land in a certain manner offers him a worthy opportunity will\r\nnot find the interest on the investment method the best suited for his\r\npurpose. This is especially true when applied to a single product. For\r\nexample, it may be shown that 50 hens will, when properly managed, in\r\nconnection with other farm enterprises, return a remarkable interest\r\non the capital employed. It does not follow, however, that a man can\r\nmake a living with fifty hens or even 500 hens. If a man has an\r\ninvestment of $5,000, on which he obtains 10 per cent, his income\r\nwould be $500. If, on the other hand, he has an investment of $25,000\r\nand obtains a return of only 6%, his income is $1,500, or three times\r\nthe former amount. In neither case, however, does this form of\r\nstatement tell a man how much of his income is due to his brain and\r\nbrawn and how much to the capital invested.\r\n\r\nWhat the young farmer wishes to know is how much will he receive for\r\nhis own time, energy and skill, after deducting all expenses and a\r\nreasonable interest charge on his investment--such a rate of interest\r\nas he could get by placing his money in good securities or what he\r\nwould be required to pay for his capital if he borrowed it. This is\r\nbest obtained by the labor income method. With this method all\r\nexpenses are subtracted from all sales and to the cash balance thus\r\nobtained is added or subtracted the increase or decrease in the\r\ninventory. This balance may be called the farm income. Thus far the\r\nprocedure is just the same as the interest on the investment method.\r\nFrom the farm income is now subtracted a reasonable interest on the\r\ninvestment, the balance remaining is called the labor income. This is\r\nthe return which the farmer has obtained by and for his own efforts.\r\nIf this balance is zero, then he should change his methods or get into\r\nsome other business.\r\n\r\nThis statement of his income, whatever it may be, enables him to\r\ncompare his prosperity with that of the man who is employed upon a\r\nsalary. Here, again, however, it is difficult to make comparisons\r\nbecause of the differences in expenses of living. The chief difference,\r\nhowever, in the expense of the wage earner in the city and the farmer\r\nis in the matter of house rent. For example, if the wage earner pays\r\n$300 a year house rent that must be deducted from his income in\r\ncomparing it with the labor income of the farmer. It is often stated\r\nthat the farmer also has his living from the farm. This was much more\r\ntrue formerly than it is at present. Under present methods of\r\ndistributing food products and with modern types of farming, the amount\r\nof food supplied the table from the farm is comparatively small. The\r\nrancher in Montana eats foods canned in Maine or Delaware, while the\r\nNew Hampshire farmer buys his vegetables from Boston commission\r\nmerchants. The Minnesota farmer cannot supply his breakfast table with\r\noranges, grapefruit or oatmeal. Many of them buy, if not their bread,\r\nat least their flour, and also their butter. The fact that the city man\r\nindulges in high living is no argument in favor of the country man\r\nexpecting less wages. Some of those things which are necessary to make\r\nthe country an ideal place to live are expensive. Some of them are more\r\nexpensive to obtain in the country than in the city, as, for example,\r\neducational facilities. In justifying his purchase of an automobile, a\r\nyoung farmer recently stated that his wife had certain cares,\r\nresponsibilities and even privations which her city friends did not\r\nhave. He thought that the automobile would help to offset them.\r\n\r\nTo my mind there is no more ideal place to live and rear a family than\r\nin the open country when the conditions are what they should be and\r\nmay be. I believe, however, it is well to insist that it costs\r\nsomething to live in the country as well as in the city if one lives\r\nas well as every farmer has a right to expect to live.\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the steps necessary in order to arrive at a fair\r\nestimate of the labor income. To make the matter concrete, we will\r\nassume a farm of 200 acres worth $60 an acre located in central\r\nPennsylvania on a limestone clay loam soil over 1,000 feet above sea\r\nlevel. This farm is to contain 20 acres of timber, a 30-acre apple\r\norchard two years old, 40 acres of pasture, 96 acres of cultivated\r\nland divided into six 16-acre fields. The rest of the 200 acres\r\nconsists of small yards, roadways and waste land. One-half of each of\r\nthe six 16-acre fields is to consist of a rotation of maize, oats and\r\nwheat, each one year, and hay three years, the latter clover and\r\ntimothy followed by timothy. The other half is to consist of maize,\r\nbarley, followed by alfalfa four years. In the young orchard there\r\nwill be grown for a few years potatoes, tomatoes, cabbages and garden\r\npeas. After the orchard attains a size which forbids these intertilled\r\ncrops, a portion of the pasture may be broken up so that these market\r\ngarden crops may be raised. There will be kept six horses, 20 milch\r\ncows, 20 ewes of some mutton breed of sheep, five brood sows and 50\r\nhens.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, let attention be called to the broad knowledge of\r\nfarming required to operate this moderate-sized and comparatively\r\nsimple farm. The crops to be raised are maize, oats, wheat, clover,\r\nalfalfa, timothy, potatoes, tomatoes, cabbages, garden peas and\r\napples. The animal products sold will be chiefly butter fat, wool,\r\nmutton, veal, pork and eggs. This is neither a long nor complex list\r\nof products. They are all adapted to the farm which the writer has in\r\nmind. Yet the man who operates this farm to the highest success will\r\nneed to have a knowledge of agronomy, or the raising of field crops,\r\nof horticulture, animal husbandry, including poultry husbandry and\r\ndairying. He needs to have a good understanding of the principles of\r\nagricultural chemistry, to have a knowledge of how to prevent and\r\ncombat fungous diseases and insect enemies. To get the most out of his\r\ntimber land he should know at least some of the first principles of\r\nforestry, and if he has gained some instruction in the study of\r\nlandscape gardening, his home will be more attractive, and his farm a\r\nsource of greater pleasure to him.\r\n\r\nTo proceed with the estimate, the first thing to be done is to make a\r\nrecord of the cropping system, giving the areas and the estimated\r\nproduction of each crop. How is the yield per acre to be determined?\r\nClearly, one cannot afford to estimate his profits on the basis of\r\nsome unusual yields. If one could be assured of 40 bushels of wheat,\r\n60 bushels of oats, five tons of hay, 300 bushels of potatoes, or 200\r\nbushels of apples per acre, or 500 pounds of butter fat per cow, or\r\n150 eggs per hen per year, there would be no difficulty about\r\nobtaining a snug labor income. Such results are possible and are\r\nappropriate ideals for which to strive, but are not safe as estimates\r\non which to do business.\r\n\r\nThe year books of the United States Department of Agriculture contain\r\nthe annual estimate of the yields, and the average December farm price\r\nof staple crops by states. These figures may serve as a basis for\r\nmaking estimates. If the natural conditions are about the average\r\nstated, one may properly assume that he can obtain an increase of 50%.\r\nHe may even hope to double the yield, although it is not safe to\r\nassume such an increase in making an estimate of profits. If the\r\nnatural conditions are more favorable or less favorable than the\r\naverage, he must take the fact into consideration in his estimates. In\r\nthe same way he may consider whether the average December farm price\r\nrepresents fairly his expectation of the price, or whether because of\r\nfavorable location or superior quality of the article purchased he can\r\nexpect higher remuneration.\r\n\r\nIt is here assumed that the young farmer is himself going to be more\r\nthan an average farmer. If he is not he will only get average results,\r\nin which case his labor income will be only that of the ordinary day\r\nlaborer.\r\n\r\nTo repeat the idea in concrete terms. If the young farmer is located\r\nin central Pennsylvania and finds that the average yield of wheat for\r\nthe state is 17 bushels an acre, he may safely estimate that his\r\nimproved methods will bring him 25 bushels of wheat to the acre. He\r\nmay even hope for 34 bushels per acre. At the Pennsylvania station\r\nseveral varieties of wheat have, during the past 18 years, averaged\r\nover 30 bushels per acre. One year one variety produced 43 bushels. It\r\nwould not be safe, however, to use such figures in estimating profits.\r\n\r\nHaving outlined the cropping system and made a careful estimate of the\r\ntotal annual production of each crop, the next step is to determine\r\nthe amount of food and bedding required for the live stock. From this\r\ndata it may be determined what products will be available for sale,\r\nand what foodstuffs must be bought. Thus, it may be found, for\r\nexample, that the amount of oats raised just meets the requirement,\r\nwhile more maize must be purchased, together with nitrogenous\r\nconcentrates, and that a portion of the hay is available for sale. In\r\nthe farm under consideration there will, of course, be wheat,\r\npotatoes, tomatoes, cabbages, garden peas and the animal products\r\npreviously mentioned for sale, and later there will be apples and some\r\nlumber from the wood lot.\r\n\r\nThe data are now at hand by which to estimate the total receipts.\r\nHaving made the estimates of receipts, the expenses are estimated, and\r\nthe difference gives the cash balance, if there is any. The most\r\nimportant items of expense will be labor, feed, seeds, fertilizers,\r\nharvesting and threshing expenses, spraying material, shipping\r\npackages, blacksmithing and repairs. After all expenses that can be\r\nthought of are included not less than 10% should be added for\r\nincidental expenses.\r\n\r\nThe amount of commercial or natural fertilizers to be purchased is, of\r\ncourse, related to the yard manure which will be produced on the farm;\r\ntherefore some estimate of the probable amount is desirable. In a\r\nroughly empirical way the amount of manure produced may be estimated\r\nat twice the amount of dry food and bedding used, provided it is\r\nhauled daily to the field. Where stored and drawn to the field at\r\nstated periods, the shrinkage in weight, although not necessarily in\r\nplant food, may be as much as one-half.\r\n\r\nThe estimate of what the inventory should be at the beginning and end\r\nof the year is not so simple a matter as it may at first seem to be.\r\nThe purpose of taking the inventory is twofold: First, to determine\r\nwhether the inventory has increased or decreased, and second, to\r\ndetermine on what amount of capital interest is to be calculated. For\r\nexample, one must carry forward each year seed for the next year's\r\ncrop. Feed must be carried over to feed live stock until other food\r\nbecomes available, and there must be money on hand with which to pay\r\nfor labor unless there is a cash income from the sale of products\r\nsufficient to care for the labor bills.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the farm under consideration there is a young orchard\r\nof about one thousand trees. This orchard is not bringing in any\r\nincome, but there is a constant expenditure of money on it, and a\r\nconstant increase in its value. While, therefore, it decreases the\r\ncash income it increases the farm income and the labor income. On the\r\nother hand, it increases the interest charges because the plant or\r\nfarm is increasing in value. How much will it increase in value? In\r\nsome sections it is customary to consider that an orchard increases in\r\nvalue $1 per tree per year. If this is a correct estimate, this\r\n1,000-tree orchard will increase the value of the farm $1,000 a year\r\nuntil it comes into full bearing. The farm under consideration was\r\npurchased two years ago for $9,500. On the assumption just stated, at\r\nthe end of 15 years from date of purchase this farm should be worth\r\n$25,000, at least $15,000 of which will be due to a 30-acre orchard.\r\nThis is at the rate of $500 an acre for the orchard itself.\r\n\r\nIn order to bring out some of the phases of the inventory more clearly\r\nthe following classification of items is given below:\r\n\r\n                              INVENTORY\r\n\r\n    A. PLANT.\r\n\r\n    The real estate, 200 acres at $60 per acre.\r\n    The live stock.\r\n      Work horses and breeding stock.\r\n    Machinery.\r\n\r\n    B. MATERIALS.\r\n\r\n    Seeds, potatoes, oats, maize, wheat.\r\n    Feed, hay for cattle and sheep, silage for cows, maize for\r\n      pigs.\r\n    Growing wheat, 8 acres at $6 per acre.\r\n    Live stock, calves, lambs and pigs.\r\n\r\n    C. SUPPLIES.\r\n\r\n    Hay and oats for horses.\r\n    Money for current expenses.\r\n\r\nIn estimating the inventory at the end of the year, a deduction should\r\nbe made for the decrease in the value of the live stock under the\r\nplant and also for the machinery. Perhaps 5% for the live stock and\r\n10% for the machinery and tools will be a fair deduction. Under\r\nmaterials and supplies those items have been inventoried which are to\r\nbe carried over each year from the preceding year. In the case of\r\nseeds the amount required must be deducted from the amount sold, or\r\nthey must appear as a charge in the expense account. Ordinarily they\r\nare carried over from year to year and thus become a part of the\r\npermanent investment. Since on the farm under consideration there is a\r\nconsiderable monthly income from the sale of butter fat and eggs, it\r\nmay be possible that no allowance will be needed in the inventory for\r\ncurrent expenses, although it is always desirable to carry a bank\r\naccount in order to be able to make favorable purchases when\r\nopportunity offers.\r\n\r\nAs a part of the work in a course in farm management, the writer asked\r\neach student to secure the financial history of an actual farm\r\ncovering a period of three years. The financial history of 30 farms\r\nduring the years 1901 to 1903, inclusive, and 28 farms during the\r\nyears 1902-1904, inclusive, was thus obtained and is given herewith.\r\n\r\n                SUMMARY OF FINANCIAL HISTORY OF FARMS\r\n\r\n    Average size of farm, acres                       143.21        133\r\n    Average area in crops (includes pasture), acres   121.1         112\r\n\r\n    Capital at end of three-year period              $14,009     $8,893\r\n    Capital at beginning three-year period            12,962      7,704\r\n                                                     -------     ------\r\n    Difference                                       $ 1,047     $1,189\r\n\r\n    Interest on capital, $13,485, at 5 per cent[B]   $   674     $  415\r\n    Increase in capital per annum                        349        396\r\n    Average yearly receipts                            3,613      2,208\r\n    Average yearly disbursements                       1,907      1,221\r\n    Average yearly cash balance                        1,706        987\r\n    Average yearly farm income                         2,055      1,383\r\n    Average yearly labor income                        1,381        968\r\n\r\nThese figures show the application of principles enunciated in this\r\nchapter. A careful reader will have no difficulty in recognizing how\r\nthe different items have been obtained. For example, the difference\r\nbetween the receipts and disbursements in the first column gives the\r\ncash balance of $1,706. The farm income, $2,055, is obtained by adding\r\nto the cash balance $349, which is the annual increase in the capital.\r\nThe labor income is obtained by subtracting from the farm income the\r\ninterest on the capital at five per cent. The amount of capital is\r\ndetermined by dividing by two the sum of the inventories at the\r\nbeginning and end of the period.[C]\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the gross receipts, the expenses, the farm\r\nincome and the labor income on these actual farms are all more closely\r\nrelated to the capital invested than the size of the farm. Thus, on\r\nthe 30 farms with a capitalization of about $13,500, the average\r\nyearly receipts were about $25 an acre, while on the 28 farms with a\r\ncapitalization of about $8,300, the average yearly receipts were about\r\n$16 an acre. Likewise on the high-priced farms the labor income was\r\napproximately $10 an acre, while on the lower priced ones it was about\r\n$7.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n  [B] Obtained by dividing by two the sum of capital at beginning and\r\n      end of three-year period.\r\n\r\n  [C] For further details see Hunt, \"How to Choose a Farm,\" Chaps.

Aside from the professional and domestic classes, the people of\r\nthe world devote themselves to three forms of work: (1) Changes in\r\nsubstance, or natural products; (2) changes in form, or mechanical\r\nproducts; (3) changes in place, or exchange of products. The second of\r\nthese forms of work gives rise to manufacturing; the third, to trade\r\nand commerce. Under the first sub-division two classes of natural\r\nproducts may be recognized; first, what, for want of a better name,\r\nmay be called chemical products, such as ores, coal and salt, from\r\nwhich are derived mining and the metallurgical arts; and second, vital\r\nproducts, or, in other words, vegetation and animals. It is work\r\napplied to the production of vegetation and animals that gives rise to\r\nagriculture. Agriculture is labor applied to the production of living\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n                        KINDS OF AGRICULTURE\r\n\r\nThe industries which deal with the production of living things may be\r\ndivided, theoretically, largely on the basis of the character of the\r\nresults, but to some extent upon the nature of the activities\r\ninvolved.\r\n\r\n                        { Grain Farming--Cereals and  }\r\n                        { grasses.                    }\r\n                        {                             }   Agriculture\r\n                        { Plantations--Cotton, sugar, }\r\n                        { tobacco, coffee.            }\r\n    Plant Production    {\r\n    (Soil Culture)      { Truck Farming, Market       }\r\n                        { Gardening--Vegetables.      }\r\n                        {                             }   Horticulture\r\n                        { Fruit Growing--Fruits.      }\r\n                        {                             }\r\n                        { Forestry--Trees, shrubs.    }\r\n\r\n                        { Stock Raising--Work, meat, fats, hides.\r\n                        { Stock Feeding--Meat, fats.\r\n                        { Stock Breeding--Animals.\r\n    Animal Production   { Dairy Farming--Milk, butter and cheese.\r\n    (An.

The twelfth census has classified\r\nfarms on the basis of their principal income. If 40% or more of the\r\ngross income of the farm was from dairy products, it was called a\r\ndairy farm; if from live stock, a live stock farm; if from cotton, a\r\ncotton farm. If no product constituted 40% of the gross receipts, the\r\nfarm was classified as a miscellaneous or general farm.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 there were 5,740,000 farms in the United States, which were,\r\naccording to the rule just stated, classified as follows:\r\n\r\n               FARMS CLASSIFIED ACCORDING TO PRINCIPAL\r\n                          SOURCE OF INCOME\r\n\r\n                                                     Gross\r\n                                           Average   income\r\n                    Total area,             size     per\r\n    Kind of farm.   acres.

Of this number, nine kinds obtained at least 40%\r\nof their products, and probably much more, from vegetable rather than\r\nfrom animal forms. However, live stock and dairy farms constitute\r\nabout one-third of the total number of farms, and almost one-half the\r\nfarm acreage. There are four kinds of farms on which the production of\r\ngrain and hay forms an important part of their activities; namely, the\r\nhay and grain farm, the live stock farm, the dairy farm, and general\r\nfarm. These constitute, in the aggregate, 75% of the farms of the\r\nUnited States, and by virtue of their larger area, they occupy 85% of\r\nthe total farm area.\r\n\r\n                      GRAIN AND HAY STATISTICS\r\n\r\nAt the close of the nineteenth century less than one-half the area of\r\nthe United States was owned in farms. Only one-half of this farm area\r\nwas considered to be under cultivation. The total area in cereals was\r\none-tenth the total land area, while 3% was devoted to hay and 2% to\r\nall other crops except pasture.\r\n\r\nWithout going into details, it may be stated with reasonable assurance\r\nthat: (1) During the last half of the last century, the production of\r\ncereals has increased much faster than the population. For example, in\r\n1850, there were raised in the United States one ton of cereal grains\r\nper capita; by 1900 this amount had increased to one and one-half tons\r\nfor each inhabitant.\r\n\r\n(2) Since the number of persons engaged in agriculture has decreased\r\nin proportion to population, the quantity of cereals produced in\r\nproportion to persons engaged in agriculture has increased in still\r\ngreater ratio. So far, therefore, as the amount of cereals is\r\nconcerned, the farmer has been getting an increasingly larger return\r\nfor his labor.\r\n\r\n(3) The quantity of cereals has increased in proportion to the arable\r\nland. This may be due to one or more of three causes: (a) greater\r\naverage yield per acre; (b) greater proportion of cereals to other\r\ncrops; or (c) to a change in the ratio of the different cereal crops.\r\nThe following table, giving the average yield of grain, reduced to\r\npounds per acre, shows not only how the substitution of one cereal for\r\nanother might affect the total production of cereal grains, but also\r\nsuggests to the young farmer how he may modify the total product of\r\nhis farm:\r\n\r\n                Yield   Lb.      Lb.\r\n                in bu.  per bu.  per acre\r\n    Maize       24.2    56       1355\r\n    Barley      23.7    48       1138\r\n    Rye         15.0    56       840\r\n    Oats        26.2    32       838\r\n    Wheat       13.2    60       792\r\n    Rice           Paddy         746\r\n    Buckwheat   14.0    48       672\r\n\r\nYields will vary relatively in different regions and with different\r\ntypes of soil, and should be studied with reference to one's\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n(4) The wheat and oat crops have increased about six and one-half\r\ntimes in 50 years, the hay crop five and one-half times, while maize\r\nhas increased four and one-half times. Cotton, the only other great\r\nstaple crop, has increased four times in the same period. The oat crop\r\nhas increased the most rapidly of any since 1880. It is interesting,\r\nand may be significant, to note that, while the production of wheat\r\nand barley in Great Britain has decreased about one-half in thirty\r\nyears, the production of oats has increased somewhat.\r\n\r\n(5) The greatest rate of increase in the production of cereals in the\r\nUnited States during the last half century has taken place since 1870.\r\nThis increase is coincident with three other facts of the utmost\r\nimportance: (a) The development of the central West, a treeless\r\nplain--prior to this period much of the farm land in the United States\r\nhad been hewn out of the forest, tree by tree; (b) the consolidation\r\nof the steam railways into transcontinental lines; and (c) the\r\nintroduction of the self-binding harvester. Formerly it took at least\r\nfive men to do what is done today by one man in the harvesting of\r\ncereals.\r\n\r\n                     ADVANTAGES OF GRAIN FARMING\r\n\r\n(1) The cost of land excepted, the production of hay and grain\r\nrequires a small outlay of money. During the past fifty years, many\r\nthousands of persons have been able to obtain farms of 160 acres at\r\nalmost no cost. With a few hundred dollars invested in horses and\r\ntools with which to plow the prairie and sow the seed, these fortunate\r\npersons have oftentimes been able to pay the whole of their expenses,\r\ncapital included, from the first crop. The renter who operates a hay\r\nand grain farm usually has but a small capital invested in his\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\n(2) The cereals bring a quick return. Wheat may be sown in September\r\nand sold in July; maize may be planted in May and sold in November;\r\noats may be planted in April and sold in August. The short period\r\nbetween seed time and harvest makes the oat crop a favorite one among\r\nrenters. On the other hand, it takes from three to seven years to\r\nproduce a marketable horse. It may take ten to fifteen years to begin\r\nto realize on an apple orchard.\r\n\r\n(3) The products are not easily perishable, and hence can be held\r\nalmost indefinitely. The development of the magnificent elevator\r\nsystem, based upon the principle that the cereals can be handled like\r\nwater, greatly simplifies the holding and preservation of these staple\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\n(4) The products are in constant demand, and hence they always find a\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nAgricultural commodities may be divided into three classes, depending\r\nupon the area which controls the price of the commodity, as follows: (a)\r\nprice units world-wide, as wheat, cotton, pork; (b) price units local to\r\nlarge districts--products too bulky to ship long distances--such as hay,\r\npotatoes and apples; (c) price units local to relatively small areas,\r\nsuch as strawberries and green vegetables. It is obvious that the larger\r\nthe area which controls the price, the more constant will be the demand.\r\n\r\n                     OBJECTIONS TO GRAIN FARMING\r\n\r\n(1) It exhausts the soil. About two-thirds of the wheat of the United\r\nStates is consumed outside the county in which it is raised.\r\n\r\n(2) It requires a large quantity of land to produce a competence. Land\r\nmust be low in price, or the interest on the money invested in the\r\nland will consume the profits. The relation of crop to income is\r\nsuggested by comparing the gross returns from an acre of potatoes or\r\ntobacco with an acre of maize. The average gross income during a\r\ndecade was, from an acre of maize, $9.50; an acre of potatoes, $38;\r\nand from an acre of tobacco, $61.50.\r\n\r\n(3) Only such part of the land as is suited to tillage can be used.\r\n\r\n(4) The marketing of cereals requires the transportation of bulky\r\nproducts. Hay is handicapped much more seriously. The distance a\r\nproduct can be shipped depends somewhat on the price per pound\r\nreceived for it. If it costs one cent a pound to ship maize to a grain\r\nmarket, obviously it cannot be transported without loss when it brings\r\nonly 50 cents a bushel. On the other hand, two cents a pound may\r\neasily be paid for shipping butter which is worth 25 cents a pound.\r\nThe transportation of $2,000 worth of maize to a railway station ten\r\nmiles distant is a laborious and expensive operation, but when this\r\nsame maize is turned into beef or pork, it will transport itself to\r\nthe station with comparatively little trouble. Notwithstanding the\r\nexcellent transportation facilities which the farmers of the United\r\nStates enjoy, 80% of the maize is consumed in the county in which it\r\nis raised. Cereal production demands better transportation facilities\r\nthan cotton farming, tobacco growing or the rearing of domestic\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n(5) Capital must lie idle much of the time. The self-binding harvester\r\nor the hay rake is only used a few weeks, or perhaps more often only a\r\nfew days, each year. A cream separator or a churn may be used every\r\nday in the year. In the first instance, there is not only interest on\r\nunemployed capital, but the capital is actually deteriorating through\r\nnonuse.\r\n\r\n(6) The production of hay and grain does not give continuous\r\nemployment. The slightest consideration of the following table must\r\nshow that unless live stock is kept, there are considerable periods of\r\nthe year in which very little labor is required, while at other times\r\nconsiderable work is necessary to prevent loss.\r\n\r\n                TABLE SHOWING THE AVERAGE ACREAGE PER\r\n                      FARM OF PRINCIPAL CROPS.\r\n\r\n                               New York   Ohio   Wisconsin   Virginia\r\n    Maize                          3       13        9          11\r\n    Wheat                          2       12        3           6\r\n    Oats                           5        4       14           1\r\n    Barley, rye or buckwheat       2       --        5           0\r\n    Hay and forage                23       11       14           4\r\n    Potatoes, beans or other\r\n      vegetables                   3        1        2           1\r\n    Fruits                         2        2        0           1\r\n    Miscellaneous crops            2        1        0           2\r\n    Pasture, wood or unimproved\r\n      land                        58       45       70          93\r\n                                 ---       --      ---         ---\r\n    Total size of farm           100       89      117         119\r\n\r\n(7) Much depends upon natural forces. While there is opportunity for\r\nthe use of knowledge and judgment in the production of high-grade\r\nseeds and even of large yields, there is not the same scope for skill\r\nthat there is in some other lines of agricultural enterprise. Skill\r\nmeans the capacity to do something difficult, and the more effort\r\nrequired to produce an object the more value it has, provided its\r\nutility is unlimited. The farming which requires the most skill pays\r\nthe best if one has the skill to apply to it. This is because those\r\nwho do not have the requisite skill are usually unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n                    THE COST OF FARMING OPERATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nSeveral millions of the inhabitants of the United States, not to\r\nmention those of other countries, are engaged each year in the\r\npreparation of the soil for the cereal and forage crops and on the\r\nwork of seeding and harvesting them. The welfare of one-third the\r\npopulation is directly and that of the other two-thirds, although less\r\ndirectly, is quite as surely dependent upon the effectiveness of this\r\neffort. If, for example, as sometimes happens, one-third the\r\npopulation receives on account of untoward seasonal conditions but\r\nfour-fifths of the usual product, everyone must suffer on account of\r\nthis unrewarded labor. Many, perhaps most, financial panics have their\r\norigin in crop failures aided, doubtless, by an improper financial\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nAlthough widely and sometimes bitterly discussed, little is really\r\nknown concerning the relation between the effort expended and the\r\nreturns obtained in producing the great staple farm products; yet one\r\nof the most important and vital considerations in the organization of\r\na farm enterprise is the income, both gross and net, which may be\r\nexpected from the different crops contemplated. Obviously the yield\r\nand price of the several crops will vary with the locality and with\r\nthe season. It is, therefore, impossible to predict for any year\r\neither what yield may be obtained or what price will be secured. If,\r\nhowever, a sufficient number of years are selected, an average may be\r\nfound which will form a basis for calculating the probable result for\r\nanother series of years. The following table gives the yield and the\r\naverage farm values per acre for five staple crops for five years,\r\n1905-1909 inclusive, for the United States and for four widely\r\nseparated states, viz., Pennsylvania, Iowa, Texas and Oregon.\r\n\r\n                 AVERAGE YIELD PER ACRE, 1905-1909.\r\n\r\n                    Pennsylvania   Iowa   Texas    Oregon\r\n    Maize, bu.          36.6       33.4    21.1     27.3\r\n    Wheat, bu.          17.8       15.5     9.6     20.6\r\n    Oats, bu.           28.9       28.9    26.6     32.8\r\n    Potatoes, bu.       84.4       85.8    67.0    119.0\r\n    Hay, tons            1.39       1.56    1.32     2.11\r\n\r\n\r\n               AVERAGE FARM VALUE PER ACRE, 1905-1909\r\n\r\n                    Pennsylvania   Iowa   Texas    Oregon\r\n    Maize              $22.59     $13.80  $12.17   $19.58\r\n    Wheat               16.61      12.42    9.11    16.10\r\n    Oats                13.33       9.28   12.97    15.20\r\n    Potatoes            55.87      44.75   65.15    71.18\r\n    Hay                 18.74      10.13   13.92    19.60\r\n\r\nSuch figures as the above may be compiled by anyone at any time for\r\nany year or series of years from the yearbooks of the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture. They form a fairly sound basis for\r\ncalculating the gross income which may be expected from the staple\r\nfarm crops, particularly for the cereals, potatoes, hay, cotton and\r\ntobacco. Five questions, however, present themselves, which should, as\r\nfar as possible, be settled before applying them to an individual\r\nproblem.\r\n\r\n(1) How nearly do the conditions, especially those of soil and\r\nclimate, of the given location correspond to the averages of the\r\nstate? The question can be settled only by a thorough study of soils\r\nand their crop adaptation. It is a matter requiring study, experience\r\nand judgment.\r\n\r\n(2) How much larger yields may be expected on account of better\r\nmethods employed? It is here that most mistakes are made in estimating\r\npossible farm profits. Necessarily, all statistical averages of\r\nproduction are much below those which an enterprising farmer considers\r\nan average crop and habitually produces. Not more than 50% increase\r\nupon these figures, however, should be anticipated by reason of the\r\nimproved methods which one is going to employ.\r\n\r\nWhile the average yield of maize, even in the so-called corn states,\r\nis not far from 30 bushels an acre, and while it is quite common for\r\ngood farmers to produce 60 to 75 bushels of maize per acre, it would\r\nnot be safe to assume a yield of more than 45 bushels unless the\r\nconditions are more than ordinarily favorable.\r\n\r\nThe application of the averages given on pages 149-150 to an\r\nindividual farm enterprise may be illustrated by calculating the\r\npossible results which might be obtained on 80 acres of arable land in\r\nIowa and Pennsylvania with the four great soil products of northern\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n                 Iowa         Pennsylvania\r\n            Acres   Income   Acres   Income\r\n    Maize     40   $552.00    15    $340.85\r\n    Oats      20   185.60     15     200.25\r\n    Wheat      5   62.10      15     249.25\r\n    Hay       15   151.95     35     655.90\r\n    Total     80   $951.65    80  $1,446.25\r\n\r\nIf 50% is added for the increased yields which may be expected on\r\naccount of the employment of better methods, the total yield from 80\r\nacres of arable land would become for Iowa $1,428 and for Pennsylvania\r\n$2,169. This does not mean that farming is necessarily more profitable\r\nin Pennsylvania than in Iowa. Not only may the cost of cultivating an\r\nacre of arable land be greater in Pennsylvania, but usually a larger\r\nterritory must be owned in order to obtain 80 acres of arable land.\r\nEighty acres of these four crops is probably as often grown on a farm of\r\n100 acres in Iowa as on one of 160 acres in Pennsylvania. The total farm\r\nacreage in Iowa is, in round numbers, 35 millions; in Pennsylvania, 19\r\nmillions. In Iowa about one-half the farm area is in the farm crops\r\nunder consideration, while in Pennsylvania these four crops occupy only\r\none-third the farm area.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. R. D. Maurice Wertz, after several years in railroad\r\noffices, took charge of his fathers farm at Quincy, Pa., in 1891, and\r\nconverted it into a fruit farm. He now has about 220 acres in peaches and\r\napples. It is understood that he has sent from the above shipping station\r\nand one other about $200,000 worth of fruit in the last six years.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. T. E. Martin, Rush, N. Y., is one of the most\r\nsuccessful potato growers in the United States. He has a farm of 57 acres\r\nof the Dunkirk series of soil. He has three 18-acre fields in rotation\r\nconsisting of potatoes, wheat and clover and alfalfa. Mr. Martin has\r\nincreased the yield of potatoes from 60 bushels per acre in 1892 to 417\r\nbushels in 1906. In 1906 he produced 7,510 bushels on 18 acres. In 1907\r\nhe sold $2,807.89 worth of potatoes from 18 acres, or $160 per acre. He\r\nattributes his large yields mainly to drainage, thorough preparation of\r\nthe soil, good tillage, spraying, clover and alfalfa, manure and\r\ncommercial fertilizers.]\r\n\r\n(3) Will there be a general increase or decrease in the price of crops\r\nduring the coming years?\r\n\r\nThe following table gives the average farm price for Missouri by\r\nfive-year periods.\r\n\r\n                 THE AVERAGE DECEMBER FARM PRICE BY\r\n                   PREVIOUS DECADES COMPARED WITH\r\n                   AVERAGE OF FIVE YEARS, 1906-10.\r\n\r\n                  1866   1875   1886   1896   1906\r\n                   to     to     to     to     to\r\n                  1875   1885   1895   1905   1910\r\n                   cts.  cts.    cts.   cts.   cts.\r\n    Maize, bu.     40     33     33      35     49\r\n    Wheat, bu.    103     87     64      71     87\r\n    Oats, bu.      30     27     26      27     39\r\n    Potatoes, bu.  57     48     49      53     68\r\n    Hay, ton      902    799    704     700    875\r\n\r\nAn examination of the last column shows that the average price of\r\nthese staple farm products has been considerably greater during five\r\nrecent years than during the previous thirty years. Will this increase\r\nin price continue, or will there be a series of years of unusually low\r\nprices which will bring the average price of the decade down to that\r\nof the previous three decades? Few persons will care to venture an\r\nanswer to this question, which is of the utmost importance to all\r\nfarmers and especially to the beginner.\r\n\r\n(4) The figures employed are taken from the yearbook of the United\r\nStates Department of Agriculture and are the estimated farm price on\r\nDecember 1 of each year. Can the commodities be sold for the December\r\nfarm price? Will potatoes sold at the time of digging bring less than\r\nthe December price? Will wheat or maize held until May bring a higher\r\nprice? To what extent, by the judicious holding of products, can\r\nadvance in price be obtained?\r\n\r\n(5) Will the products be sold for cash, or may they be turned into\r\nanimal products at an increased profit? In some sections of the United\r\nStates animals are reared primarily because of the increased profit\r\ndue to manufacturing soil products into animal products; in other\r\nregions, however, they are kept primarily for the purpose of\r\nmaintaining the fertility of the soil and only incidentally on account\r\nof the increased profits.\r\n\r\n                         COST OF PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nFor a number of reasons it is difficult to determine the cost of\r\ngrowing farm crops. One reason deserves to be especially emphasized. In\r\nany business enterprise it may be necessary to run at a loss, because\r\nto stop would entail a still greater loss. This is particularly true in\r\nfarming, where men are employed by the month in order that they may be\r\nhad when needed. Since they are receiving pay, it is better that such\r\nmen should be employed some days at farm operations which return only a\r\nportion of their wages rather than not to have them employed at all.\r\nUnder such circumstances, therefore, the cost of producing a given crop\r\nmay be greater than is indicated by the time actually employed in its\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\nMany other factors also enter, as the average number of hours per day\r\nwhich it is possible to work. This is greatly influenced by weather\r\nconditions. The Minnesota station determined that the working day on\r\nabout thirty farms in that state varied from seven and one-half to\r\neight and one-half hours, with two to three and one-half hours on\r\nSunday. The average length of the working day for horses varied from\r\n3.1 to 3.3 hours.\r\n\r\nThe cost for labor of cultivating a given area of land will depend not\r\nonly on the crop or crops to be raised, the climate, the topography\r\nand character of the soil, the size and shape of the fields and the\r\nsystem of cropping, but also upon the man's ability for organization.\r\nIt is said that the European farmers, and even the farmers from\r\neastern Canada, are several years in adjusting themselves to farming\r\nin western Canada. When the farmers from Iowa, Kansas, Nebraska or\r\nsurrounding states move into western Canada with their three-horse\r\nteams and other suitable equipment, applying their thorough knowledge\r\nof prairie farming, they are at once successful. The man is thus an\r\nimportant factor.\r\n\r\n                TIME REQUIRED FOR CULTURAL OPERATIONS\r\n\r\nThe following table will be helpful as showing time required to\r\nperform certain operations, since it is a record of labor actually\r\nemployed on a field of 18 acres of easily tilled land in central Ohio.\r\nAll labor was employed at prices named, board for man and food for\r\nhorses being furnished in addition at the prices estimated. The owner\r\nof the land furnished the horse for the harvester.\r\n\r\n    Plowing                           7.5   days at $2   $15.00\r\n    Harrowing                         3     days at  2     6.00\r\n    Planting                          2     days at  2     4.00\r\n    Cultivating (4 times)             7     days at  2    14.00\r\n    Cultivating with harvester        6     days at  1     6.00\r\n    Husking and cribbing by the job                       45.54\r\n    Estimated cost of board          25-1/2 days           7.95\r\n    Estimated team maintenance       25-1/2 days           4.90\r\n                                                        -------\r\n                                                        $103.39\r\n\r\nAccording to these figures the cost for labor of raising the crop and\r\nthe cost of harvesting was almost exactly the same, each being a\r\nlittle less than $3 an acre.\r\n\r\n                  THE COST OF PRODUCING FARM CROPS\r\n\r\nThe Minnesota station has determined the cost of growing the staple\r\nfarm crops on 45 farms in different sections of the State. The total\r\nexpense per acre for an average of six years is shown in the following\r\ntable, not including land rental or cost of marketing.\r\n\r\n             COST OF PRODUCING FARM CROPS IN MINNESOTA.\r\n\r\n    Spring wheat, land fall plowed        $5.54\r\n    Oats, land fall plowed                 5.80\r\n    Barley, land spring plowed             6.89\r\n    Maize, husked from standing stalks     9.41\r\n    Hay, timothy and clover                3.68\r\n    Potatoes, land not fertilized         23.36\r\n    Potatoes, land fertilized             34.72\r\n\r\nSome years ago the writer made an estimate of the cost of producing\r\nmaize, oats, wheat and clover hay in a four-course rotation on a\r\ntenant farm in central Pennsylvania. The soil was a heavy clay and\r\nrequired plowing for each crop, except, of course, the hay crop, one\r\nacre a day being considered a good day's work.\r\n\r\nCounting the expense of man and team at $2 per day, the labor cost per\r\nacre was found to be $7 for maize, $5.10 for both wheat and oats, and\r\n$2.30 for hay, or an average of about $4.90 per acre for the four\r\ncrops. The interest on the capital invested in operating this farm,\r\nexclusive of the land, was estimated at $1.45 per acre.\r\n\r\n                 INFLUENCE OF YIELD UPON THE COST OF\r\n                             PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nThe Illinois station has prepared a set of estimates upon the cost of\r\nproducing an acre of maize, showing variations in cost due to\r\ndifferences in yield. In these estimates, instead of making a charge\r\nfor the actual cost of manure or fertilizer applied, an estimate is\r\nmade of the value of the plant food removed.\r\n\r\n               COST OF PRODUCING ONE ACRE OF MAIZE IN\r\n                   ILLINOIS AS MODIFIED BY YIELD.\r\n\r\n                     Yield    Yield    Yield     Yield\r\n                     50 bu.   75 bu.   100 bu.   35 bu.\r\n    Disking          $0.40    $0.40     $0.40    $0.40\r\n    Plowing           1.00     1.00      1.00     1.00\r\n    Preparation        .75      .75       .75      .75\r\n    Planting           .15      .15       .15      .15\r\n    Seed               .35      .35       .35      .35\r\n    Cultivation       1.00     1.00      1.00     1.00\r\n    Plant food        1.02     1.53      2.04      .71\r\n    Husking           1.25     1.87      2.50      .88\r\n    Marketing         1.00     1.50      2.00      .70\r\n                     -----    -----    ------    -----\r\n    Cost per acre    $6.92    $8.55    $10.19    $5.94\r\n    Cost per bushel    .14      .11       .10      .17\r\n\r\nThe average yield per acre in Illinois for 12 years preceding date of\r\nthis estimate was 35 bushels per acre; the average price per bushel\r\nduring the same period was 32 cents.\r\n\r\n                 LABOR COST OF PRODUCING A BUSHEL OF\r\n                                GRAIN\r\n\r\nNot counting rent of land or interest on capital invested in\r\nequipment, nor depreciation of soil fertility, it has been shown that\r\nunder favorable conditions, the labor cost of growing and harvesting\r\nan acre of wheat or oats may be as low as $4.50, and that of maize as\r\nlow as $5 per acre. Assuming the average labor cost of producing an\r\nacre of wheat or oats at $5.50 and of maize at $6 per acre, and taking\r\nthe average yields per acre for a series of years to be 13.8 for\r\nwheat, 30.9 bushels for oats and 24.9 bushels for maize, the average\r\nlabor cost per bushel will be: Wheat, 40 cents; oats, 17-1/2 cents;\r\nand maize, 28 cents.\r\n\r\nThe data given in this chapter are to be accepted as suggestive rather\r\nthan as determinative. The chief purpose in presenting them is to\r\nplace before the young farmer an appreciation of some of the problems\r\ninvolved in the production of the chief and basic agricultural\r\ncommodities. The young farmer's success will be modified by the role\r\nwhich they occupy in his farming system and by his ability to adjust\r\nthem to the economic conditions in which he may find himself placed. A\r\nthorough understanding of the principle underlying the data submitted\r\nwill go far toward enabling him to make this adjustment, although none\r\nof the illustrations given may have been obtained under conditions\r\nidentical to his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n                        THE PLACE OF INTENSIVE\r\n                               FARMING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the survival of the most fit applies equally to the\r\nfield of biology and to the field of economics. The general introduction\r\nof vegetables and fruits into the human dietary has, by banishing the\r\nloathsome diseases of the Middle Ages, greatly increased human\r\nefficiency. It follows that those peoples or nations who employ\r\nvegetables and fruits in abundance, other things being equal, will be\r\nmost fit to survive and must outstrip others less fortunately situated.\r\nWe may for this reason alone look forward to the increasing importance\r\nof vegetable growing and fruit raising; but there is a more obvious and\r\nperhaps more direct reason. There is in the production of vegetables, at\r\nleast, a method of satisfying the dietetic needs of an increasing\r\npopulation. The employment of a part of the area now in cereals and\r\nforage crops for the production of potatoes, cabbages, legumes, roots\r\nand tomatoes is one of the most ready means of increasing the food\r\nsupply. Whether such substitution will be advantageous to the human race\r\ndepends, however, not so much upon the food returns from a given area of\r\nland as upon the products from a given amount or unit of labor.\r\n\r\n                        KINDS OF HORTICULTURE\r\n\r\nIn that form of intensive agriculture to which is given the designation\r\nhorticulture, there may be recognized several more or less distinct\r\ndivisions, as fruit growing, market gardening, truck farming and\r\nfloriculture. Each has its own special problems, based upon conditions\r\nof culture and market. While, as in all classifications, there is more\r\nor less overlapping, the tendency is for them to become more and more\r\ndistinct. The market gardener is the producer of vegetables for a local\r\nmarket, while the truck farmer produces similar products for a larger\r\nor wider distribution. The former grows a great variety of products,\r\ndisposing of them in relatively small quantity, not infrequently\r\ndirectly to the consumer. The latter raises a few highly specialized\r\ncrops which he sells in gross, usually through a commission merchant.\r\nTruck farming has developed since 1860, in consequence of the growth of\r\nlarge cities, which require enormous supplies of vegetables of fairly\r\nuniform quality, and on account of the continuous demand for fresh\r\nvegetables as nearly as possible throughout the year. Watermelons and\r\nsweet potatoes can be raised in the southern states and laid down in\r\nNew York City or Boston more cheaply than they can be raised in the\r\nsuburbs of these cities, and, what is equally important, they will be\r\nof superior quality.\r\n\r\nThe extension of railway facilities, the introduction of refrigerator\r\ncars and the building of cold storage plants has made it possible to\r\ngrow in one climate products to be consumed in another. Cold storage\r\nhas enabled the fruit growers of California to supply the eastern\r\nmarkets with peaches and other fresh fruit. Chicago, to give only one\r\nexample, begins to receive strawberries, cabbages and tomatoes from\r\nthe shores of the Gulf of Mexico early in the year and continues to\r\nreceive these products, until finally they are being shipped late in\r\nthe summer from the shores of Lake Superior. It is estimated that the\r\nchange of locality from which these products come, travels northward\r\nat the rate of from 13 to 15 miles a day.\r\n\r\n               IMPORTANT FACTORS IN INTENSIVE FARMING\r\n\r\nIn the neighborhood of large cities, notably in the environs of Paris,\r\nmarket gardeners often produce their vegetables in made soil. The\r\nlocal character of the soil under such conditions is a matter of\r\ncomparative indifference, since a board floor would answer every\r\nrequirement as a resting place for the artificial soil. The large\r\nexpense in preparing and constantly renewing the seed bed is only\r\neconomically possible, however, where proximity to a large city\r\nout-weighs all other considerations.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily climatic and soil adaptation are prime factors in\r\nsuccessful horticulture--much more than in any other branch of\r\nagriculture. Each fruit has a restricted climatic range, and in most\r\ncases the number of soil types on which a given fruit can be made a\r\ncommercial success is likewise limited. Thus, in general, apples and\r\npears require heavier soils than peaches. Success in commercial apple\r\ngrowing requires even greater discrimination, since different\r\nvarieties of apples demand different soil conditions. Thus Baldwins\r\nare grown the most successfully where a northern climate is modified\r\nby proximity to the Great Lakes. Rhode Island Greenings will succeed\r\non soils too heavy for many other varieties. The York Imperial has not\r\nyet achieved a great commercial success save on one type of soil. Some\r\nvarieties of apples are much more restricted in their adaptation than\r\nothers. Thus, while the King is quite restricted, the Ben Davis has a\r\nfairly wide cultural adaptation. No one should plant an orchard until\r\nhe has made a thorough study of his soil and climatic conditions and\r\nhas received the highest possible expert assistance in choosing the\r\nvarieties best adapted to his conditions.\r\n\r\nThere is an increasing tendency to specialize in vegetable growing.\r\nThe production of celery, onions, muskmelons, watermelons, cabbages,\r\ncauliflowers, tomatoes and sweet corn, to mention only some of the\r\nmost striking examples, are becoming more and more localized. Even\r\nwhere vegetables and flowers are grown under glass, not only is each\r\nhouse devoted to a single species, but, notably in the case of roses,\r\ngrowers are restricting themselves more and more to a few varieties.\r\nThis is due to the fact that it is impossible to give in one house, or\r\neven in one establishment, the special set of conditions required for\r\nthe most economic development of each species or variety of plant,\r\njust as in the open air the natural conditions are best adapted to a\r\nlimited number of horticultural products.\r\n\r\nSo much being admitted, it follows that it is folly to attempt to grow\r\nplants under unfavorable climatic and soil conditions when competing\r\nin the same market with those possessing favorable ones. It is true,\r\nof course, that where one man fails another often succeeds, but this\r\nis no reason why a man should apply his talents under unfavorable\r\ncircumstances. In fact, one of the important attributes of most\r\nsuccessful men is their ability to recognize and apply their energies\r\nunder conditions which will give them the most effective return for a\r\ngiven effort. There is no virtue in unnecessary toil. Progress in any\r\nenterprise, as progress in the human race, can be accomplished only in\r\nreducing the amount of labor required to produce a desired result.\r\n\r\nAll this is axiomatic. The purpose of emphasizing it here is that it\r\nis fundamental to the success of those who attempt to produce\r\nhorticultural products. The necessity for the emphasis lies in the\r\nfact that these factors are so often disregarded. They are of most\r\nvital importance to the man who attempts to raise tree fruits. A\r\nmistake in the planting of celery, cabbage, or onions may be rectified\r\nthe following season, but if a mistake is made in planting tree\r\nfruits, it may, as in the case of apples, require ten or even 20 years\r\nto discover the error.\r\n\r\nThe growth in commercial orcharding is due in part to the need of\r\nspecial knowledge and facilities for combating fungous diseases and\r\ninsect enemies and to the better markets which a large production of\r\nuniform quality makes possible. While these are extremely important\r\nconsiderations, there is a more fundamental reason, which may in the\r\nlong run exercise an even more potent influence. The location of the\r\nordinary family orchard, so called, has been determined in almost\r\nevery instance by the location of the farm buildings. There is no\r\nnecessary relation between a good site for a farm dwelling and a\r\nsuitable location for an orchard. It happens, therefore, that family\r\norchards, taken as a whole, are not grown under as favorable\r\nconditions as are commercial orchards. This is a sufficient reason in\r\nitself, even if the other reasons above mentioned did not exist, why\r\nthe commercial orchard must, in time, supplant these accidental\r\nplantings.\r\n\r\n                     ADVANTAGES OF HORTICULTURE\r\n\r\nThe advantages of this intensive form of agriculture as compared with\r\nthe more extensive forms discussed in Chapter XII may be stated as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n(1) A large gross income per acre may be obtained. An investigation of\r\ntruck farming made some years ago indicated a gross return per acre\r\nabout 40 times as great as that obtained on an average from all forms\r\nof agriculture.\r\n\r\n(2) There is a large opportunity for the use of skill in raising and\r\npreparing products for market and an equal opportunity for the\r\nexercise of judgment in choosing the best markets.\r\n\r\n                    DISADVANTAGES OF HORTICULTURE\r\n\r\n(1) It requires considerable capital, particularly for machinery and\r\nlabor. In the investigation in truck farming above mentioned the\r\ncapital per acre invested in land, buildings, implements and teams was\r\neight times that in the more general forms of agriculture.\r\n\r\n(2) The products are for the most part readily perishable, requiring\r\nspecial facilities if held for any length of time.\r\n\r\n(3) Growing out of above-mentioned fact, the market is easily\r\noverstocked at any given point, and hence prices often fluctuate\r\nwidely.\r\n\r\n(4) The yield is also quite variable, this class of products being\r\nespecially influenced by seasonal conditions and particularly subject\r\nto insect attacks and fungous diseases. Since large capital is\r\ninvested in labor, the horticulturist may be involved in financial\r\nruin through causes which he is unable to control.\r\n\r\n(5) The labor question, in certain forms of horticulture more than in\r\nothers, involves difficulties, among which is need of large quantities\r\nof cheap labor for short periods of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n                          REASONS FOR ANIMAL\r\n                              HUSBANDRY\r\n\r\n\r\nAnimal products in the United States nearly equal in value those of\r\nall other farm products. Those soil supplies which constitute the food\r\nof domestic animals are not implied. Practically every farm in the\r\nUnited States keeps domestic animals, either for their labor or their\r\nproducts, and nearly every household in both city and country keeps\r\none or more animals for companionship. The domestication of animals\r\nhas been a prime factor in the civilization of the human race by\r\nfurnishing man with motive force by which he has been able to increase\r\nhis productive power; by giving him a larger, better and more regular\r\nfood supply; and by furnishing the materials for clothing, making it\r\npossible for him to inhabit temperate and even arctic climates.\r\nAnimals have not been less important in advancing the spiritual\r\nwelfare of the human race, by inculcating habits of regularity and\r\nkindliness, which the care of domestic animals imposes.\r\n\r\n                    INCREASE IN ANIMAL PRODUCTION\r\n\r\nDuring the last half century animals have not increased in numbers as\r\nrapidly as have the inhabitants, but the value of animals has increased\r\nmuch more rapidly. While a part of this increase in value is due\r\nperhaps to a greater cost of production, a couple of illustrations will\r\nsuffice to show that part of this increase in value has been due to\r\nincrease in the individual merit of the animals. In 1850 sheep in this\r\ncountry produced 2.4 pounds of wool per fleece; in 1910 they produced\r\n6.9 pounds per fleece. Thus, while in 50 years sheep have not quite\r\ndoubled in numbers, the production of wool has increased more than five\r\ntimes. This is a striking example of the value of improvement in\r\nbreeding, because the improvement in wool production is due to the\r\ninfluence of heredity in far greater degree than to the effect of\r\nimproved feeding. Wool, like the hair on one's head, is not greatly\r\ninfluenced by the food supply, assuming it to be reasonably ample. Beef\r\ncattle offer another illustration of the way in which animal products\r\nhave been increased without increasing the number of animals. Formerly\r\nbeef cattle were matured in their fourth and fifth years, or even their\r\nsixth year. They are now placed upon the market in their second and\r\nthird years. If animals can be matured in their third instead of their\r\nfifth year, it is obvious that a much smaller number of animals must be\r\nkept upon the farm in order to provide an equal annual supply for\r\nslaughter.\r\n\r\nThe increase in the size of our horses and the increased production of\r\nbutter fat per cow which have occurred in the past half century are\r\nhardly less important factors in increasing the value of domestic\r\nanimals and their products.\r\n\r\n                   THE FUTURE OF DOMESTIC ANIMALS\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking features of recent progress in domestic\r\nanimals is the large increase in the number of horses and the still\r\ngreater increase in their value. There are those who have believed\r\nthat the invention of many beneficent forms of mechanical power would\r\nin time, if not in the very near future, supplant the use of animals\r\nas a motive power. The fact seems to be, however, that they merely\r\naugment man's resources and increase his opportunities without\r\nlessening his need for animal power.\r\n\r\nIt appears reasonable to suppose that there will be witnessed in the\r\nUnited States a gradual shifting of live stock centers. During the\r\npast half century, the great central West has been noted for the\r\nproduction of live stock, particularly for beef, mutton and wool, as\r\nan incident of its pioneer development. Already the production of\r\nlarge herds of cattle and flocks of sheep has disappeared for the\r\ncentral West, and is now confined largely to Texas and the mountain\r\nstates. The northeastern states are unrivaled in the production of\r\ngrass, and have considerable areas less fitted for tillage than the\r\nprairie states. In time, therefore, the tendency will be for the\r\nregions best fitted to rear animals to increase their numbers of\r\nbreeding animals. On the other hand, those states which produce grain\r\nin relatively large abundance may give more attention to fattening\r\nanimals and to the production of dairy products which can be shipped\r\nlong distances. As time advances, the history of other countries will\r\ndoubtless be repeated. A greater distinction between the breeding and\r\nrearing of animals, and their fattening and preparation for market\r\nwill occur.\r\n\r\n                  ADVANTAGES OF KEEPING LIVE STOCK\r\n\r\nSince animals occupy a place in practically all farm organizations, it\r\nis desirable to state briefly the advantages and disadvantages which\r\nmay accrue to any individual enterprise. The most striking advantages\r\naffecting the farmer are:\r\n\r\n(1) Animals make it possible to use land that would otherwise be\r\nwholly or partly unproductive. Hillsides and mountain slopes, soil too\r\nstony to cultivate, fields traversed by winding streams, and land\r\npartially covered with trees, are familiar examples. As previously\r\nmentioned, only about one-half the farm area in this country is\r\nimproved land, and only two-thirds, even of the improved land, is in\r\ncultivated crops. The other third of the improved land and a\r\nconsiderable portion of that half of the farm area known as unimproved\r\nland are utilized as pasture for domestic animals.\r\n\r\n(2) They make use of farm crops which would be entirely or partially\r\nwasted. Straw, the stalks of maize, clover and alfalfa hay and other\r\nleguminous forage crops would not have sufficient value to pay for\r\nraising if animals were not kept to convert them into useful products.\r\nIn fact, the usefulness of a given animal may be judged by the economy\r\nwith which he converts these otherwise useless products into food or\r\nother materials for the use of man. The most profound studies are\r\nbeing made to determine the conditions under which this takes place.\r\n\r\n(3) In thus acting as machines in manufacturing raw materials into\r\nfinished products animals convert these coarse and bulky materials\r\ninto those which are much more concentrated, thus making their\r\ntransportation economically possible. A pound of beef has required\r\nfood containing ten pounds of dry substance, and a pound of butter has\r\nrequired thirty pounds of dry matter to produce it.\r\n\r\nThese refined products may be shipped around the world, while the raw\r\nmaterials may not be profitably transported beyond the county in which\r\nthey are raised. Moreover, the farmer has the profit which comes from\r\nmanufacturing the raw materials into refined products.\r\n\r\n(4) In the production of these finer products much of the essential\r\nmaterials of plant growth are left upon the farm. The experiments of\r\nLawes and Gilbert show conclusively that in fattening animals more\r\nthan nine pounds out of ten of the essential fertilizing ingredients\r\nof the food reappear in the solid and liquid excrements. Prothero\r\nsays: \"Farming in a circle, unlike logic, is a productive process.\"\r\n\r\nThe fiscal policy of one of the great nations of the globe is based\r\nupon this idea. Everything possible is done by Germany to encourage\r\nthe keeping of live stock, because the more live stock that is kept,\r\nthe more productive will be the soil. The larger the crops raised the\r\nmore people will be required to harvest them and the larger will be\r\nthe population to recruit the army and navy. The Kaiser and the German\r\nscientist recognize that the fighting force of the Empire is related\r\nto the number of domestic animals reared. The meat supplies of the\r\npeople are, therefore, taxed to bring about this end.\r\n\r\n(5) The rearing of live stock makes it possible to arrange a better\r\nrotation of crops. A five-year and, even better, a six-year rotation,\r\nis more effective than a four-year in maintaining the crop-producing\r\npower of the soil and enables the farmer to reduce his cost of\r\nproduction. It is possible to keep a larger proportion of the farm in\r\ngrass and other forage crops, thus reducing the amount of land plowed\r\nannually and at the same time decreasing the exhaustion of the land,\r\nprovided the forage crops are fed to live stock upon the farm.\r\n\r\nThere is an old Flemish proverb which reads:\r\n\r\n                       \"No grass, no cattle;\r\n                        No cattle, no manure;\r\n                        No manure, no crops.\"\r\n\r\nThe point of this proverb is that good grass is the basis of good\r\nagriculture. Investigations have shown that one may go farther and say\r\nthat one of the most ready means of increasing the crop-producing\r\npower of the soil is by adding fertilizers to grass land. The large\r\nnumber of plants per acre enables the plants to utilize the fertilizer\r\nto the highest degree, and plowing under the resulting dense sod is\r\none of the most effective methods of enriching the soil.\r\n\r\n(6) Animals require constant care, thus making possible a more\r\nconstant use of labor and other capital. The wheat farmer of North\r\nDakota sows his wheat in April and May and harvests it in July and\r\nAugust. He usually threshes it immediately, and is practically without\r\nemployment for himself, his teams or his men from September until\r\nApril. On live stock farms the labor employed in the summer in the\r\nfield is needed in the winter in paddocks and stables.\r\n\r\n(7) The management of live stock, including the rearing of poultry and\r\nthe manipulation of dairy products, may be made to require a higher\r\nskill than the production of farm crops as ordinarily practiced. The\r\ncommunities which have given the most attention to dairying and to the\r\nrearing and fattening of animals have generally been the most\r\nprosperous.\r\n\r\n                 DISADVANTAGES OF KEEPING LIVE STOCK\r\n\r\n(1) Keeping live stock increases the capital required to operate a\r\ngiven area of land, especially where animals are kept in connection\r\nwith the production of hay and grain. Not only must there be capital\r\nwith which to purchase animals, but usually more is invested in\r\nbuildings. In a self-contained farm--that is, one which raises\r\nsufficient food for the requirements of the live stock--ten dollars an\r\nacre may be considered a moderate investment for animals. If, however,\r\nthe plan is to raise only the coarse feed, while the necessary grain\r\nas well as other concentrates is largely purchased, a farm may easily\r\ncarry from $25 to $35 worth of live stock per acre. Lack of capital is\r\none of the most potent influences in preventing a larger production of\r\nanimals and animal products. Cattle paper, or notes given to secure\r\nmoney for the purchase of fattening animals, is a common bank asset in\r\nthe feeding districts of the central West.\r\n\r\n(2) The very perishable nature of animals entails a great risk in the\r\ninvestment of capital in live stock. Not only the products of a single\r\nyear, but the growth of a number of years, may be suddenly swept away\r\nby disease. This may include the crops of several years, thus\r\ndestroying capital invested in the production of the crops as well as\r\nthe capital originally invested in the animals. Many a farmer has seen\r\nthe gradual accumulations of years rapidly melt away in the presence\r\nof some contagious disease. Tuberculosis in cattle, cholera in hogs\r\nand liver rot in sheep are striking examples of diseases that have\r\ncaused the farmers of this country untold losses.\r\n\r\n(3) When an animal has been properly fattened he must be sold. If held\r\nfor any great length of time, not only is there a constant outlay for\r\nfood to maintain the animal, but the condition of the animal may\r\nactually deteriorate. Hence it is not possible to hold animals for a\r\nbetter market for a long period of time, as is possible in the case of\r\nthe cereal grains.\r\n\r\n(4) Serious losses may occur where profit was expected through a rise\r\nin the price of foodstuffs. Scarcity in food supplies, due to an\r\nunfavorable season, often compels the stockman to sacrifice animals\r\nthat he has been raising for two or three years. It is sometimes\r\nasserted that, although society suffers from short crops, the farmer\r\nis benefited, because the increase in price is greater than the\r\ndecrease in yield. One year, for example, the decrease in the\r\nproduction of maize was 30%, while the increase in price was 50%. If,\r\ntherefore, the crop had been sold it would have brought more than the\r\ncrop of the previous year. The farmers, however, require about 80% of\r\nthe maize crop in the production of their live stock, so that when\r\nthere was a decrease of 30% in the yield of maize, many had none to\r\nsell, while others had to purchase maize at increased prices or use\r\nother crops, such as oats, which they might otherwise have sold. Still\r\nothers would be compelled to sell, at reduced prices, their partially\r\nfattened animals. There is a constant fluctuation in the price of\r\nanimals and animal products, due to variation in yield and hence in\r\nprice of food supplies. It requires continual vigilance on the part of\r\nthe stockman to secure food supplies at such cost as will enable him\r\nto secure a profitable return from his animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n                         RETURNS FROM ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn any well-considered plan of farm operations it is essential to have\r\nsome basis for estimating the amount of food required to carry live\r\nstock through the year in order to know, on the one hand, what portion\r\nof the crops raised are available for sale and, on the other hand,\r\nwhat food supplies must be purchased. A requisite of any successful\r\nfarm enterprise is a proper consideration of these market conditions.\r\nWhile domestic animals consume a variety of foods, and each class of\r\nanimals has special food requirements, the basis of calculation of the\r\nneeded supplies is fortunately not complicated. Twenty-five pounds of\r\ndry matter are required per day for each thousand pounds of live\r\nweight of horses, cattle and sheep, and for swine about 40 pounds for\r\neach thousand pounds of live weight. It may be more convenient to\r\ncalculate the food requirement of swine on the basis of increase in\r\nlive weight, allowing five pounds of dry matter for each pound of\r\nincrease. Some further details as to food requirements will be found\r\nin the paragraphs which follow.\r\n\r\n                       COST OF PRODUCING HOGS\r\n\r\nPigs possess two characteristics which make them unique among domestic\r\nanimals. They consume concentrated and easily digested foods only, and\r\nthey produce nothing but meat, fat and bristles. Cattle furnish milk\r\nand hides; sheep, wool, hides and sometimes milk; fowls furnish eggs\r\nand feathers. On account of their limited range of usefulness and\r\nbecause of the high value of much of the food consumed, it would not\r\nbe possible to rear swine economically were it not for their\r\nprolificacy and the fact that they are employed largely as scavengers.\r\nMany cattle are fattened without direct profit. The indirect profit\r\ncomes from the sale of the pigs which have followed the cattle. It is\r\ncustomary to mature one hog with little or no additional food while\r\nfattening two steers. In many well-known ways, pigs consume products\r\nwhich would otherwise be wasted. This is especially true in the more\r\ndensely settled sections of the world.\r\n\r\nOn account of their prolificacy, the returns obtained for the amount\r\nof capital invested is greater than in the case of sheep, cattle or\r\nhorses. Ten sows, worth $100 to $150, are sufficient to produce 100\r\npigs; 75 to 80 ewes, worth from $300 to $500, are required to produce\r\nan equal number of lambs; 110 cows, worth $4,500 to $6,000, to produce\r\n100 calves; and 200 mares, worth from $20,000 to $30,000, to guarantee\r\n100 foals. To put the matter in another way, the capital invested in\r\nswine may be reproduced in the offspring ten times in one year; the\r\ncapital invested in horses not more than once in five years.\r\n\r\nIn general, 500 pounds of maize will produce 100 pounds of pork, which\r\nis equivalent to eleven pounds of pork from a bushel. Since hogs are\r\nso largely produced from maize, the price of maize and the price of\r\npork are very closely related. For example, if maize is worth fifty\r\ncents a bushel, the grain required to produce a pound of increase in\r\nlive weight will cost about 5 cents; if 40 cents a bushel, 4 cents; if\r\n30 cents a bushel, 3 cents; and so on.\r\n\r\n                       COST OF PRODUCING SHEEP\r\n\r\nIn the classic investigations by Lawes and Gilbert, food containing\r\n100 pounds of dry matter produced a live-weight increase of nine\r\npounds in steers and 11 pounds in sheep. At the Wisconsin station,\r\nsheep required less food than steers per pound of gain. During rapid\r\nfattening of sheep 500 pounds of clover hay and 400 pounds of maize\r\nmay produce 100 pounds of increase in live weight. While swine require\r\na less weight of food for a pound of increase than sheep, on account\r\nof the more digestible character of the food eaten, yet the Wisconsin\r\nstation found that the expense of producing a pound of increase was\r\nless in sheep on account of the less expensive character of the food.\r\n\r\n                  MEAT AND MILK PRODUCTION COMPARED\r\n\r\nA summary of the investigations of American experiment stations shows\r\nthat 100 pounds of dry matter produced ten pounds of increase in live\r\nweight of steers. The same quantity of food when fed to milch cows\r\nproduced 74 pounds of milk, plus one pound of increase in live weight.\r\nThis 74 pounds of milk contained 3-1/4 pounds of fat. In general,\r\ntherefore, the food required to produce a pound of butter fat is about\r\nthree times that required to produce a pound of increase in steers.\r\n\r\n                        COST OF STEER FEEDING\r\n\r\nThe fattening of beef animals is largely conducted by farmers who make\r\na specialty of it. This is particularly true in the so-called corn\r\nbelt. Into this region are gathered the two and three-year-old and,\r\nmore rarely, yearling steers, many of which have been reared in Texas\r\nor in the mountain states where the supply of maize is not sufficiently\r\nample to fatten them. These are placed in paddocks with open sheds,\r\nwhere they are fed from 90 to 150 days, after which they are sent to\r\nmarket for slaughter. The food consists usually of maize fodder, maize\r\nstover, hay, maize (usually in the ear), a little bran, linseed or\r\ncottonseed oil meal. The ration per day during rapid fattening is about\r\n20 pounds of dry matter per 1,000 pounds of live weight, containing 16\r\npounds of digestible substance, of which 1.25 to 1.75 is digestible\r\nprotein. One hundred pounds of increase may be obtained under average\r\nconditions from 150 pounds stover, 325 pounds of hay, 775 pounds of\r\nmaize and 75 pounds of cottonseed meal.\r\n\r\nGreat variations will occur, however, depending upon the condition of\r\nthe animals at the beginning of the feeding period and the degree of\r\nfatness or finish to which the animals are brought before placing upon\r\nthe market. In any case, the food consumed will cost more than the\r\nvalue of the increase. The only way that steers can be profitably\r\nfattened is by increasing the value per pound of the animal. Thus an\r\n800-pound steer may be purchased at five cents per pound, or $40.\r\nAfter feeding, say 150 days, he may weigh 1,100 pounds, when to bring\r\na profitable return he should sell for 6 cents a pound, or $65. This\r\nis a gain of $25, eight of which came from the increase in value of\r\nthe original 800 pounds. Usually steers cannot be fattened profitably\r\nunless there is an increase of at least three-quarters of a cent per\r\npound in the value of the animals and then, as previously explained,\r\nonly in connection with the hogs which follow them.\r\n\r\n                COST OF PRODUCING MILK AND BUTTER FAT\r\n\r\nWell-selected and properly fed cows may produce 240 pounds of butter\r\nfat annually. The amount of fat obtained will depend upon the richness\r\nof the milk. Thus, 8,000 pounds of 3% milk, 6,000 pounds of 4% milk,\r\nor a trifle less than 5,000 pounds of 5% milk, will give this quantity\r\nof butter fat. These are customary returns from different types of\r\ncows.\r\n\r\nIf each cow in the herd is dry for six weeks each year the daily\r\naverage of the cows actually milked will be three-quarters of a pound\r\nof butter fat. There are herds which make an average of nine-tenths of\r\na pound of butter fat per day, but to secure this result requires\r\nsuperior cattle, careful feeding and more than ordinary care.\r\n\r\nThe standard ration for milch cows weighing from 1,000 to 1,200 pounds\r\nis 25 pounds of dry matter, two-thirds of which is digestible. The\r\nration should contain not less than two pounds of digestible protein.\r\nIn ordinary practice, about ten pounds of the dry matter of the ration\r\nis obtained from maize silage, nine pounds from hay and about six\r\npounds from grain or other concentrates. In general, this is obtained\r\nby feeding 35 pounds of maize silage, ten pounds of hay and seven to\r\neight pounds of concentrates. The silage may be estimated at one-tenth\r\nto one-eighth of a cent a pound, hay at from one-fourth to one-half\r\ncent and concentrates at from three-quarters to one and one-quarter\r\ncents per pound, varying, of course, with the different sections of\r\nthe country. The amount of food needed will vary somewhat with the\r\nsize of the animals, but will depend much more largely upon the amount\r\nof milk and butter fat given. While maintaining substantially the\r\ngeneral average just given for the whole herd, it is the practice of\r\ncareful feeders to vary the amount of concentrates fed to each\r\nindividual in accordance with the amount of butter fat or milk given.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. Gabriel Hiester, Harrisburg, Pa., graduate of the\r\nPennsylvania State College, for many years trustee of the college and\r\npresident of the State Horticultural Society, had a beautiful farm home\r\nnear Harrisburg. During the first twenty years in bearing his orchard, of\r\nwhich one-fourth the trees were unprofitable varieties, returned an\r\naverage of $80 per acre with apples selling at 60 cents to $1 per bushel.\r\nMr. Hiester believed, with a proper selection of varieties and a\r\nfavorable location, that any well-managed orchard can be made to do much\r\nbetter.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dr. J. H. Funk, Boyertown, Pa., graduate of the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania, 1865, farmers' institute lecturer, former\r\nstate pomologist, has 50 acres of apples and peaches. Returns from his\r\nplantings begun in 1896 are so phenomenal that he is afraid to permit the\r\npublication of his profits. It is known, however, that he has sold $5,000\r\neach of peaches and apples in one year.]\r\n\r\n                   COST OF MAINTAINING WORK HORSES\r\n\r\nAt the Minnesota station, the total cost of feeding and maintaining a\r\nfarm work horse for one year was estimated to be from $75 to $90, of\r\nwhich about $20 was charged for interest and depreciation. On the\r\nbasis of 3.3 hours as the length of the working day, the cost per\r\nhorse per hour was estimated to be 7-1/2 cents. At the Ohio state\r\nuniversity, it was found that four horses weighing about 1,400 pounds\r\nwere chosen to perform 2,185 hours of labor during one year, while\r\nunder like conditions four horses, weighing about 200 pounds less,\r\nworked on an average but 1,641 hours each. For each secular day,\r\ntherefore, the former worked about 7-1/2 hours, while the latter were\r\nemployed but five and one-half hours. The cost of food was estimated\r\nat $54; cost of shoeing, repairs of harness and stable supplies at\r\n$6.50; and the cost of feeding, grooming and cleaning of stables at\r\n$23.50, or a total cost of $84 per year. Nothing was charged for\r\ninterest or depreciation, but the expense of feeding and caring for\r\nthree colts was included in the estimates given. The annual expense of\r\nmaintaining a horse was practically the same in both states, but the\r\ncost per hour of labor performed was less because of the possibility\r\nof employing the horses at productive labor a larger portion of the\r\ntime. Too much emphasis cannot be placed upon the need of planning a\r\nfarm organization which will give continuous employment to horses as\r\nwell as to men in order to realize the most profitable returns. An\r\nindustrial system that makes it necessary to maintain work animals\r\nthree days in order to secure one day's work falls far short of an\r\nideal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n                              FARM LABOR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem of farm labor demands thoughtful and frank consideration.\r\nSince work is an essential element in the production of all wealth, it\r\nfollows that every industry has its labor problem. The adjustment of\r\nlabor to the production of the various forms of wealth must ever\r\nconstitute one of the most important problems in any organized\r\nsociety. It is often remarked that the labor problem is the chief\r\ndifficulty in farming. In a certain sense this is true, since work is\r\na primary element in the production of agricultural as well as all\r\nother wealth. It is not true, however, that the problem of labor is\r\nmore difficult or more intricate than that of other industries. In\r\nfact, that problem is less delicate than in some other occupations,\r\nbecause farming is less industrialized.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible to settle once for all the problem of labor for any\r\noccupation, since changing conditions will give rise to new questions\r\nor new phases of the old problem. Moreover, the problem of labor on\r\nthe farm will grow more difficult as farming becomes more specialized\r\nand as the methods of production become more complex.\r\n\r\nHowever, the labor problem on the farm is different from that in the\r\nmanufacturing industries or in trade and transportation. This chapter\r\nwill not concern itself with an attempt to settle the farm labor\r\nproblem, but will undertake to state the character of some of the\r\ndifferences between it and other forms of labor and to discuss some of\r\nthe changes in recent years.\r\n\r\nA large proportion of farm work is done by the farm owner, or renter,\r\nand his family. There is not much opportunity to profit by the labor\r\nof other persons. In 1900 there were in the United States 1,812\r\nindustrial establishments each of which employed between 500 and 1,000\r\npersons, while there were 675 establishments each of which had more\r\nthan one thousand employees. In the same year there were 5,739,657\r\nfarms, which employed in the aggregate 4.4 millions of people, not\r\nincluding the owners of the farms. Moreover, over one-half of the 4.4\r\nmillion persons thus employed were members of the families of the\r\nfarmer. In other words, aside from members of the family, there was\r\nless than one employee to every two farmers. Since a considerable\r\nnumber of farmers employ more than one person, it follows that the\r\nmajority of farmers employ no help other than members of the family.\r\n\r\nIn another particular farm labor differs from that of other forms of\r\nlabor even more widely. There are sociologic as well as economic\r\nquestions involved. Baldly stated, custom permits, and necessity often\r\nrequires, the laborer to eat at the same table with the farm owner and\r\nin other particulars he mingles intimately with the farmer's family.\r\nIn all its bearings, this is a very important fact. It constitutes one\r\nof the greatest difficulties in the problem of securing suitable farm\r\nhelp. Industrial corporations employ as common laborers largely\r\nItalians, Hungarians, Poles and negroes. The English, the Irish, the\r\nGerman, the Swede and the Norwegian have been readily received and\r\nassimilated in the American farming communities. The peoples of\r\nEastern and Southern Europe are often criticized because they do not\r\nbecome farm laborers. That they do not is in large part due to the\r\nfact that the farm hand is usually a member of the farmer's family.\r\nThus the supply of common labor which is today used by the rest of the\r\nindustrial world is not open to the farmer.\r\n\r\nFarming differs from some other occupations in that it does not\r\nordinarily offer the laborer much opportunity for advancement. The\r\nfireman on a railway train becomes the engineer; the brakeman becomes\r\na conductor. There are opportunities in many establishments for the\r\nadvancement of the industrious and clever. A man may enter their\r\nservice with the hope of being able to marry and support a family. On\r\nthe other hand, all our land laws are based upon the idea that each\r\nfarm should be of sufficient size to support only one family. Where it\r\ndoes support two families, the relation is usually that of landlord\r\nand tenant. The farm laborer, therefore, must look upon his employment\r\nas more or less temporary. The young man who intends to become a\r\nfarmer will find employment upon the farm a desirable if not essential\r\npreparation for his future occupation.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of farm machinery has had the effect of increasing\r\nthe price of farm labor while at the same time decreasing the amount\r\nof labor needed. The reason is that the introduction, not alone of\r\nfarm machinery, but all forms of machinery, has made man's labor much\r\nmore efficient than formerly. Farm wages have doubled since the\r\nintroduction of horse-drawn machinery. The labor income in the\r\ndifferent sections of the United States is influenced by the extent\r\nand efficiency with which machinery is used. The relation of labor\r\nincome to the use of horse power is shown by the following table taken\r\nfrom a recent census:\r\n\r\n               INFLUENCE OF FARM MACHINERY AS SHOWN BY\r\n                    THE RELATION OF LABOR INCOME\r\n                        TO HORSES AND MULES.\r\n\r\n                                        Number of horses\r\n                                          and mules to\r\n    Divisions of the                      1,000 persons\r\n    United States      Labor Income      in agriculture\r\n    North Atlantic        $299                1,655\r\n    South Atlantic         163                  808\r\n    North Central          402                3,036\r\n    South Central          211                1,603\r\n    Western                510                5,476\r\n    -----------------------------------------------\r\n    United States         $288                2,105\r\n\r\nIn one of the states of the South Atlantic division the average price\r\nof farm labor, without board, was $12 per month, while in one of the\r\nstates of the western division the price on the same date was $31.\r\nWhy? Because in the latter case a man's labor was more productive. In\r\nthe South Atlantic division, in producing the chief crops cotton and\r\nmaize, a man uses one mule in preparing and cultivating the soil. In\r\nthe western division plowing and harrowing with six-horse teams is\r\ncommon and nine-horse teams are not unusual. The cotton picker in one\r\nday will be able to gather not to exceed 300 pounds of seed cotton,\r\nworth not more than $15. The western wheat will be harvested by a\r\nmachine drawn by 28 horses. In the same time four men with this outfit\r\nwill cut and thresh 700 bushels of wheat, worth $500.\r\n\r\nWhen the threshing machine was first introduced in Ohio, it was\r\nstubbornly opposed by all farm laborers. \"They claimed it,\" says\r\nBateman, \"as a right to thresh with a flail, and regarded the\r\nintroduction of machinery to effect the same object in a few days\r\nwhich would require their individual exertion during the whole winter,\r\nnot only as an invasion of a time-honored custom, but as absolutely\r\ndepriving them of the means of obtaining an honest livelihood. At a\r\nlater date, when a reaper had been introduced into a field of ripe\r\nwheat as a matter of experiment only, every one of the harvest hands\r\ndeliberately marched out of the field and told the proprietor that he\r\nmight secure his crop as best he could, that the threshing machine had\r\ndeprived them of their regular winter work twenty years ago and now\r\nthe reaper would deprive them of the pittance they otherwise could\r\nearn during harvest.\" How short-sighted they were! No class gained so\r\nmuch from the introduction of labor-saving machinery as did those who\r\ndid the labor. The reason for the increase in well-being, the reason\r\nsociety enjoys luxuries and comforts beyond the fondest dreams of\r\nformer generations, is due to the fact that the labor of each man has\r\nbeen made so much more effective through these labor-saving devices.\r\nThe humblest citizen shares in this improvement. Not all share alike\r\nand not all share equitably, but each generation sees its members\r\nsharing more equitably than those of any generation which preceded it.\r\n\r\nThe proposition is an extremely simple one. If a man produces just\r\nenough food for himself and family, he will have nothing for clothing,\r\nshelter, or education. If, however, a man produces four times as much\r\nfood as he and his family consume, he may exchange one-fourth for\r\nshelter, one-fourth for clothing and have remaining a fourth for\r\neducation, and recreation or savings. This is only another way of\r\nsaying that the greater the amount of any useful commodity produced by\r\na single day's labor the larger will be the laborer's income or wages.\r\n\r\nAlthough the increase in intensive agriculture and the diversification\r\nin farming tend to increase the need of farm laborers, the introduction\r\nof farm machinery has much more than offset this demand. The tendency\r\nof farm laborers to become farm tenants; or, to state it in other\r\nwords, the tendency of landowners to rent their land rather than to\r\ncontinue to operate it themselves, is not without its influence upon\r\nthe labor problem.\r\n\r\nThe invention and introduction of farm machinery has accentuated the\r\ndifficulty of keeping the farm laborer continuously employed. The\r\ndecrease in the demand for farm labor and the increasing lack of\r\nuniformity in the amount required have caused a gradual depletion of\r\nthe smaller villages and hamlets which were a source of labor supply\r\nduring harvest and other busy seasons.\r\n\r\nThe problem of keeping labor continuously employed has always been a\r\ndifficult one on the farm, because of the change of seasons and\r\nbecause of the variations in the weather from day to day. There is a\r\nwide difference between those industries which are carried on within\r\ndoors and farming, which is subject to the caprices of the weather.\r\nNatural causes produce tremendous variations in the return for labor.\r\nFor example, in 1901 there were produced in the aggregate 3,006\r\nmillion bushels of wheat, maize and oats, while in 1902 there were\r\nharvested 4,180 million bushels. Here is an increase of over a\r\nthousand million bushels. The same farmers tilled the same soil in the\r\nsame way as far as natural causes would allow, and yet there was a\r\ndifference in result amounting to 39 per cent. A variation of one\r\nhundred million bushels of wheat from year to year, due to climatic\r\nconditions solely, is not at all unusual.\r\n\r\nThe manufacturer also has far greater control of his labor. When it\r\nrains, he has a roof over his workmen, and hence the work is not\r\ninterrupted. When it grows dark, he turns on the light and the work\r\ncontinues. If it gets cold, he lights the fire and still the work\r\ncontinues comfortably. It is not so in agriculture. There is a great\r\nvariation in the working efficiency of men employed in farming. In a\r\ncertain locality there were twenty-one days of rain in the thirty-one\r\ndays of May. The next year between June 5 and September 5 in the same\r\nlocality there was not half an inch of rainfall at any one time.\r\n\r\nWhat is true of labor is also true of machinery. The farmer must\r\npurchase machinery which he can use only a few days in the year, while\r\nthe manufacturer, for the most part, employs his machinery continuously,\r\nsometimes day and night. While natural causes prevent the farmer from\r\nusing the same business methods, or from being able to calculate his\r\nprofits with the same precision as is possible by those following\r\nmanufacturing and mercantile pursuits, it is nevertheless important that\r\nfarming should be planned to avoid, as far as possible, the influence of\r\nnatural causes. Certain kinds of farming are less dependent upon natural\r\ncauses than others. Wisdom and foresight can do much to avoid, in all\r\nfarming, untoward influences. The clever farmer seldom complains about\r\nthe weather.\r\n\r\nFarm machinery has made unnecessary, and hence unprofitable, some of\r\nthe labor at which children were formerly employed. In the not distant\r\npast many, perhaps most farmers, owed their prosperity in large\r\nmeasure to the labor of their children. A large family, especially of\r\nboys, was a valuable asset. Even a generation ago conditions were not\r\nfar different, and two generations ago were quite the same as those\r\ndescribed by Homer:\r\n\r\n       \"Another field rose high with waving grain:\r\n       With bended sickles stand the reaper train:\r\n       Here, stretch'd in ranks, the level'd swaths are found;\r\n       Sheaves heaped on sheaves here thicken up the ground.\r\n       With sweeping stroke the mowers strow the lands;\r\n       The gath'rers follow, and collect in bands:\r\n       And last the children, in whose arms are borne\r\n       (Too short to gripe them) the brown sheaves of corn.\r\n       The rustic monarch of the field descries,\r\n       With silent glee, the heaps around him rise.\r\n       A ready banquet on the turf is laid\r\n       Beneath an ample oak's expanded shade.\r\n       The victim ox the sturdy youth prepare:\r\n       The reapers due repast, the women's care.\"\r\n\r\nThere is also another reason why the age of the employed has been\r\nraised. It is due to the growth of higher education. Where formerly\r\nthe farmer's children between the ages of twelve and twenty-one did\r\nmost of the farm work, now many of them at the same age are attending\r\nschools and colleges. The sons of a man, who a generation ago found no\r\nopportunity to get beyond the district school, graduate from high\r\nschool and college, and thus spend most of their time in study until\r\nthey are past twenty-one years of age.\r\n\r\nLabor unions have doubtless caused a scarcity of farm labor by\r\nincreasing the proportion of the created wealth which goes to the man\r\nwho labors without capital. When a man can obtain fifty cents an hour\r\nfor laying brick, he does not wish to work in the hay field at twenty\r\ncents an hour, even though the difference in the cost of living may in\r\ngreat measure offset the difference in wages.\r\n\r\nThere is a growing tendency to perform work by what is called contract\r\nlabor. Thus a person may agree to weed and hoe sugar beets at a\r\ncertain rate per acre. He, in turn, employs a force of cheap laborers\r\nwhich he sends from farm to farm to do this work. The harvesting of\r\nfruits and garden crops is not infrequently done in some such manner.\r\nIn one instance a contractor of laborers of foreign birth has been\r\nfurnishing them for all kinds of farm work. He keeps 20 to 40 of these\r\nlaborers on a small farm, furnishing them a dwelling and selling them\r\nfood supplies. Farmers telephone for help when in need. The contractor\r\nreceives $1.65 for a day's work and pays the laborer $1.50.\r\n\r\nIt appears from the preceding considerations that there are open to\r\nevery farmer at least three methods of increasing the efficiency of\r\nfarm labor. He may make every day's labor more efficient by use of\r\nlabor-saving machinery and the employment of it in the most efficient\r\nmanner; as, for example, using three 1,500-pound horses to his farm\r\nmachinery instead of a pair of 1,200-pound horses. He may modify the\r\ncharacter of his farming in order that profitable labor will be more\r\ncontinuous. He may modify the method of employing labor; as, for\r\nexample, by introducing the system of contracting labor for specific\r\npurposes where feasible.\r\n\r\nIncrease in the price of farm labor is not an evil. It is an\r\nindication that labor applied to agriculture is becoming more\r\nproductive and hence more profitable. Since more than one-half the\r\nlabor of the farm is done by the owner and his family, the farmer is\r\nbenefited through the rise in price of farm wages. The more that labor\r\ncan be made to earn upon the farm, the better it will be not only for\r\nthe farm owner but for society in general.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n                               SHIPPING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe means of facile transportation and the machinery of trade are the\r\nneed and the development of a complex civilization. The importance of\r\nthese useful adjuncts of everyday life is indicated by the fact that\r\nabout one-fourth of all the people engaged in gainful occupations in\r\ncivilized communities are employed in them. Nevertheless the expense\r\nof transportation and trade constitutes a tax upon the consumer which\r\nit is the aim of modern methods to reduce to the lowest limits. Recent\r\ninvestigations indicate that for every thirteen dollars the consumer\r\nexpends for farm products the producers receive six dollars. In some\r\ndirections most remarkable results have been accomplished. A recent\r\nquotation on wheat per bushel was as follows: Chicago, $0.93; Antwerp,\r\n$1.04; London, $1.06; Hamburg, $1.07. Eleven to 14 cents per bushel\r\nrepresents the cost of haul and commissions between Chicago and the\r\nEuropean cities named. Methods of handling have been so perfected that\r\nfrom the time the western farmer places the bundle of wheat at the\r\nmouth of the threshing machine the grain literally flows through the\r\nchannels of trade until it reaches the flour sack. On an average the\r\nEnglish miller pays about 20 cents a bushel more for wheat than the\r\nAmerican farmer receives for it.\r\n\r\nThe cost of distributing many other farm products is greater, although\r\nthe range of distribution is much less. The cost of haulage and\r\nselling potatoes is from 25 to 50% of the retail price, while with hay\r\nit is still higher. The cost of distributing all forms of truck and\r\nmarket garden produce is high and often wasteful. Many attempts have\r\nbeen made to eliminate a part of this cost as well as to better the\r\nconditions of the supplies when they reach the consumer. While many\r\nindividuals have been quite successful in dealing directly with the\r\nconsumer, little has thus far been accomplished that affects general\r\ntrade conditions. Great improvements have been made in methods of\r\ntransportation and methods of preservation. Cold storage and canned\r\ngoods have been the direction in which progress has been notable.\r\n\r\n                  WASTEFUL METHODS OF DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\nOwing to customs and traditions there is frequently a great waste of\r\neffort in some of the methods of trade. The meat trade of France is an\r\nexcellent illustration. Certain sections of France make a specialty of\r\nrearing cattle. At a suitable age these animals are purchased by other\r\nfarmers who fatten them. Many of the small towns maintain market\r\nplaces at which fairs are held to facilitate these negotiations.\r\nFrequently there is a shipment from one region to another, which is\r\nconducted by a middleman. When fattened the steers are collected by a\r\nstock buyer, who may ship them to La Villette, the live stock market\r\nof Paris. Here they are placed on sale through commission men. There\r\nare the usual charges for yardage and food. After being sold the\r\nanimals are driven to the slaughterhouses. The carcasses are then\r\ntaken by wagon to the great market of Paris located near the center of\r\nthe city. Here the retail vender of meats comes, makes his purchase,\r\nreloads the meat, which may have been unloaded less than an hour\r\nbefore, carries it to his shop, where the consumer seeks it. The\r\nnumber of people concerned and the amount of hand labor have been\r\nexcessive.\r\n\r\nNor is the American system without its faults. The Iowa or Illinois\r\nfarmer fattens cattle that may have been reared in Montana or Texas.\r\nAfter the stock buyer, the commission man and the stock yard company\r\nhave each taken his toll, the packer ships the carcasses back to the\r\nvery region where the animals were fattened, when the stockman may\r\npurchase it of the local vender of meats. The facilities and\r\nperfection with which these many transactions are accomplished is one\r\nof the wonderful sights of our country. Nevertheless the producer of\r\nmeat products may well consider whether some more economical system of\r\ndistribution may not be devised.\r\n\r\n                  SHIPMENTS: SOURCES OF INFORMATION\r\n\r\nAll railroad rates are now carefully supervised by the federal\r\ngovernment and are open to the inspection of the public. Such\r\ninformation as is ordinarily needed may be obtained from the local\r\nstation agent, who is always glad to be of service to patrons of his\r\nroad. If information of a special character is required, it may be\r\nobtained by addressing the division freight agent of the railroad in\r\nthe region under consideration. The name of this officer is to be\r\nfound in the circulars and upon the posters of the railroad.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the freight facilities offered by any individual\r\nrailroad, there are what are known as fast freight lines. These\r\nagencies enable through and prompt shipment from inland points in our\r\nown country to inland points in another. An individual railroad may\r\noperate in connection with several such agencies. A certain railroad,\r\nfor example, is combined with nine fast freight lines. Freight agents\r\nof local roads in the principal towns usually represent the fast\r\nfreight lines and are prepared to transact business.\r\n\r\nIn seaport cities there are firms styling themselves foreign freight\r\ncontractors, outward freight agents, steamship agents, or ship\r\nbrokers. These firms are prepared to quote prices on shipments to any\r\npart of the world on either regular or tramp ships. They will give\r\nfreely to intending shippers full information concerning methods and\r\nconditions of shipment. There is nothing mysterious about the business\r\nof shipping farm products. The necessary details may be acquired by\r\ninquiry in the channels indicated and by a little study of the data,\r\nwhich will be cheerfully furnished.\r\n\r\n                           RAILROAD RATES\r\n\r\nA great many factors are involved in determining the rate which is\r\ncharged for transporting different products. In a certain sense it is\r\ndoubtless true that the rate charged is based upon what the traffic\r\nwill bear. The purpose here, however, is to state some of the customs\r\nwhich exist rather than to discuss the philosophy or justice of them.\r\n\r\nThe rate may vary with the value of the product, without any regard to\r\nthe cost of the haul. Suppose the cost of shipping a ten-gallon can of\r\nfresh milk between two points to be 32 cents, the cost of shipping a\r\nsimilar can of cream may be 50 cents. The cost of shipping a carload\r\nof hay is less than a carload of wheat.\r\n\r\nIn some instances, zones or belts have been recognized, the rate from\r\nall towns within each zone being the same for a given product. Certain\r\nrailroads centering in New York recognize four zones for the shipment\r\nof milk and cream, as follows:\r\n\r\n    Zone A--First 40 miles.\r\n    Zone B--Between 40 and 100 miles.\r\n    Zone C--Between 100 and 190 miles.\r\n    Zone D--Beyond 190 miles.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that the size of these zones varies and may be the\r\nsubject of adjustment between railroads and shippers.\r\n\r\nWhile less understood by the public, railroads recognize zones or,\r\nmore properly, groups of towns in making rates to them instead of from\r\nthem, as in the instance above mentioned. It is possible to change the\r\nrate on a product to a given town by classifying it in another group.\r\nThe rate on bran and other stock foods from central western points to\r\ncertain towns in New York state has been the same as that charged to\r\nBoston, Mass., while other towns in New York not far removed have\r\ntaken a lower rate.\r\n\r\nDifferential rates are recognized to be legitimate. Railroads are\r\nallowed to charge a less rate for wheat intended for export than that\r\nintended for local consumption. There has sometimes been a wide\r\ndifference between the freight rate on wheat between Kansas City and\r\nGalveston, Texas, depending upon whether the wheat was to be exported\r\nor intended for domestic use.\r\n\r\nIn certain sections and for certain products the railroad rate varies\r\nwith the season, because of difference in competition. The railroad\r\nrate between Chicago and New York on grain is higher while the\r\nnavigation of the Great Lakes is suspended. As an illustration of the\r\ncheapness of transportation by water, it is stated that sometimes it\r\nis cheaper to ship wheat from Chicago to Buffalo by boat than to store\r\nit in a grain elevator for an equal period of time.\r\n\r\nProducts may sometimes be sent by baggage to greater advantage than by\r\nexpress, special arrangements for which are generally required.\r\n\r\n                FACILITIES FOR FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION\r\n\r\nAmerican railway facilities are, perhaps, unrivaled among the nations\r\nof the world, but the United States is still behind other nations in\r\nthe matter of means of local transportation, in which good roads is\r\nonly a part of the problem. In France, the so-called _messagers_ are a\r\ncommon feature of local traffic. Thus in the Department of Touraine\r\nthere are 246 towns each having from one to four _messagers_, who with\r\ntheir great two-wheel carts, each with single draft horse, make one or\r\ntwo trips to Tours each week. The _messagers_ carry freight both ways\r\nprecisely in the same capacity as railroads do. While the railroads\r\nare fairly abundant these local agencies continue to thrive because\r\ndelivery can be made directly to the consignee and delivery at the\r\nexact time and place is more certain. The enormous loads conveyed in\r\nthese two-wheel carts by one horse is an element in this system to\r\nwhich the good roads of France now contribute. In 1799, France had\r\nconstructed 25,000 miles of roadway. Since that time, over 300,000\r\nmiles of roadway have been completed and about 30,000 miles of railway\r\nhave been constructed--ten miles of roadway for each mile of steam\r\nrailway. The good roads of France are of comparatively recent origin,\r\ncontributing materially to the improvement in well-being which has\r\ntaken place during the same period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n                              MARKETING\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout stopping to inquire the reasons, it may be recalled that there\r\nare two rather distinct forms of trade, wholesale and retail. The\r\nwholesale trade is conducted by three classes of persons: dealers or\r\nmerchants, commission men, and brokers. The dealer is one who buys the\r\ngoods outright and takes his own risk on making a favorable sale to\r\nthe retailer. The commission man is one who receives the goods, sells\r\nthem at such price as he may be able to obtain and remits to the\r\nseller the amount obtained less expenses and his commission. The\r\nbroker is a man who effects a sale without coming in contact in any\r\nway with the materials sold. A cheese broker, for example, receives\r\ninstruction from different factories to sell for them a certain\r\nquantity of cheese of a given kind and quality each week or month as\r\nthe case may be. At the same time he receives from grocery stores\r\nwhich retail cheese orders for various amounts, kinds and quality of\r\ncheeses. With this information at hand, he directs the various\r\nfactories intrusting their business to him to ship the kind, quantity,\r\nand quality of cheese required by his several customers. For such\r\nservice he receives a brokerage, which is less than that charged by a\r\ncommission man because he is not required to handle or store the\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nSince the different farm products are purchased by different classes\r\nof retailers, and since their handling and sale require different\r\nfacilities and special knowledge, there have arisen in the great\r\ncenters of trade different kinds of markets, each having its\r\nparticular facilities for the handling, care and sale, and each\r\nconducted by commission men or brokers with a special knowledge of the\r\ntrade. Furthermore, certain cities have become, on account of their\r\nfavorable position--to mention but one reason--headquarters for\r\ncertain products or groups of products. Thus Petersburg, Virginia, has\r\nthe principal wholesale market for peanuts. Elgin, Illinois, has been\r\nnoted for its butter market. St. Louis is the leading mart for mules.\r\n\r\nIn a general way, the following five more or less distinct and\r\nimportant classes of markets for farm products may be recognized:\r\nGrain, Live Stock, Produce, Cotton and Tobacco.\r\n\r\n                          METHODS OF TRADE\r\n\r\nThe brokers or commission men doing business in any one of these\r\nmarkets usually form an association called a board of trade, chamber\r\nof commerce or similar title for the purpose of assisting \"each other\r\nin the pursuit of common ends.\" The result has been uniformity of\r\nmethods and charges; but above all in importance, perhaps, has been\r\nthe definition of classes and grades of the products placed on sale.\r\nThe tendency is for the associations in the different cities to adopt\r\nuniform rules for the grading of products, so that No. 2 red winter\r\nwheat may mean the same thing in Toledo and New York; that the\r\nquotation on prime beef may refer to the same quality of cattle in\r\nPittsburgh as it does in Chicago; and that No. 1 Timothy hay in\r\nBaltimore and St. Louis may be alike. While the tendency is towards\r\nuniformity, much yet remains to be accomplished. The shipper must be\r\non his guard lest he suffer loss through the variations in the\r\nclassification or variations in their interpretations on the different\r\nmarkets.\r\n\r\nThere has grown up around these markets some agency which stands as a\r\ndisinterested party between seller and buyer impartially determining\r\nthe weight and in some cases the quality of the object under\r\nnegotiation. The State of Illinois employs agents who inspect all cars\r\nof grain consigned to the Chicago market. These inspectors determine\r\nthe kind, grade and weight of the grain in each car. The car is then\r\ndelivered under seal to the purchaser. If either seller or buyer is\r\ndissatisfied with the inspector's decision he may, by complying with\r\ncertain regulations, have this decision reviewed by a higher\r\nauthority. The decision of this higher authority is final and must be\r\naccepted by both parties. Brokers selling grain in carload lots ship\r\nthe cars subject to the weight and grade as determined by the\r\ninspector at Chicago. Grain of a specific grade may thus be bought in\r\nChicago or other great grain markets with almost perfect security as\r\nto weight and quality by persons living in any part of this or any\r\nother country. At Elgin the quality of butter is determined by a\r\ncommittee appointed by the Board of Trade from its own members. In the\r\nlive stock markets, the stock yards company, in addition to furnishing\r\nyards, shelter, food and water, acts as agent between seller and buyer\r\nin determining the weight of the animals. The purchaser or his agent\r\nmust determine for himself the quality of the animals he buys.\r\n\r\n                            GRAIN MARKETS\r\n\r\nThe Chicago and St. Paul Boards of Trade and the New York Produce\r\nExchange are the three great agencies for dealing in grain in the\r\nUnited States. Buffalo, Duluth, Baltimore and Philadelphia are also\r\nimportant markets. Adjuncts to these markets are the great terminal\r\nelevators capable of holding almost indefinitely enormous quantities\r\nof wheat and other grain. On the Pacific Coast all the wheat is\r\nhandled in the bags, as is the custom in the other markets of the\r\nworld. Canada and the United States alone have recognized the\r\nprinciple that wheat and other grains will run like water, which has\r\nbeen a prime factor in their competition with other nations.\r\n\r\nCountry elevators charge two cents a bushel for storage during the\r\nfirst 15 days and 1/2 cent for each additional 15 days. The charge for\r\nstorage at terminal elevators for the first 15 days is 3/4 cent. The\r\nfarmer may thus store his wheat in an elevator in place of his farm if\r\nhe chooses so to do, although the wheat he thus puts in storage may\r\nhave been made into flour and consumed before he sells it. This may be\r\nlooked upon as a sort of intermediary step between storing wheat in\r\none's own granary and dealing in futures.\r\n\r\nThe country shipper pays 1/2 cent a bushel commission for the sale of\r\nwheat. There is also a charge for inspection and insurance, and, in\r\ncase there is an advance payment, for interest. After five days there\r\nare storage charges. This has given rise to the expression, gilt edge,\r\nregular and short receipts, depending upon the length of time there\r\nremains before storage charges must be paid. Every market has a grade\r\nknown as contract grade, meaning the quality that must be furnished\r\nwhen wheat or other grain is sold without specifying the grade. In\r\nChicago No. 2 red winter wheat is the contract grade. Where grain is\r\nsold or purchased by a broker, the brokerage is usually 1/8 cent per\r\nbushel.\r\n\r\n                             HAY MARKETS\r\n\r\nAt least twenty cities have adopted the rules of the National hay\r\nassociation as to classes and grades of hay and straw. The southern\r\nstates constitute an important market for the hay of the north central\r\nstates, while Boston, New York and the mining towns of Pennsylvania\r\nare important markets for the northeastern states. The size of bale\r\nvaries from 75 to 200 pounds. Small bales of 100 pounds each are\r\npreferred in Baltimore, medium bales of 110 to 140 pounds in\r\nPhiladelphia, while New York and Boston usually deal in the larger\r\nbales. The commission charges vary from 50 cents to $1 per car. In New\r\nYork, $1 pays all charges. At Chicago, $3 per car has been charged for\r\nthe inspection, divided equally between seller and buyer.\r\n\r\n                           PRODUCE MARKETS\r\n\r\nEvery town of any consequence has its produce market. The South Water\r\nstreet district in Chicago and the West Washington street market in\r\nNew York are noted for their extent and variety. There are also many\r\nspecial markets for certain classes of produce. Thus Elgin, Chicago\r\nand New York have butter exchanges. Wisconsin, Utica, Watertown and\r\nCuba (New York) maintain exchanges where cheese is placed on sale each\r\nweek during the manufacturing season. There is also a board of trade\r\nfor cheese in New York City. The prices quoted upon these exchanges\r\nare made the basis of many transactions between buyer and seller, who\r\nnever enter these markets. Not only do buyers and sellers agree to\r\nabide by the quotations of one or the other of these markets, but the\r\nquotations are also used as a basis of settlement for milk furnished\r\nthe creamery or factory. These agencies are thus impartial arbiters in\r\ncountless financial transactions.\r\n\r\nThe rate of commission varies in different markets and for different\r\nproducts. Generally, however, produce is handled on a 5% basis, but\r\nfor individual products which are especially bulky and difficult to\r\nhandle, such as cabbage, 10% may be charged. In some cases commission\r\nis by quantity instead of on a percentage basis. Thus for potatoes the\r\ncommission is sometimes 10% and in other cases 4 or 5 cents a bushel.\r\n\r\n                         LIVE STOCK MARKETS\r\n\r\nWhile poultry and game, as well as the carcasses of the smaller\r\nanimals, may be handled through the produce markets, the large animals\r\nrequire separate facilities. The United States is noted for its large\r\nlive stock markets and for the perfection and size of the packing\r\nhouses which have grown up about them. The most famous example of\r\nthese combined agencies is to be found at Chicago, but important live\r\nstock markets are also maintained at St. Louis, Kansas City, Omaha,\r\nPittsburgh, Buffalo and more recently Fort Worth, Texas. The\r\ncommission charges vary from 50 cents to $1 per head for cattle and\r\nfrom 10 to 25 cents per head for calves, sheep and hogs. In some\r\nmarkets, the commission on hogs is 2% of the gross returns. When\r\nlocated within 150 miles of a central market, it is customary to allow\r\n50 cents per hundred pounds for cattle and 40 cents for hogs to cover\r\nshrinkage, and cost of freight, yardage, food, bedding and commission.\r\nIt is possible for an owner to sell his own live stock in these yards,\r\nbut the commission man, because of his superior knowledge of existing\r\ntrade conditions, is almost universally employed. Firms which handle\r\ncattle, sheep and hogs seldom sell horses. Although handled by\r\ndifferent commission firms, important horse markets are maintained at\r\nChicago and Buffalo immediately adjacent to the market for meat\r\nanimals. In New York the horse markets are in a different section of\r\nthe city, that for draft and common work horses on one street, while\r\nthe American Horse Exchange, located at another point, handles\r\nhigh-class light horses. The usual custom is to sell horses at\r\nauction, although they may be purchased at private treaty. In whatever\r\nmanner purchased, it is essential to understand precisely the\r\ncharacter of the guarantee.\r\n\r\n                  COTTON, WOOL AND TOBACCO MARKETS\r\n\r\nBecause of their higher value per pound and the ease with which they\r\ncan be stored, cotton, wool and tobacco are dealt in somewhat\r\ndifferently than other farm products. The two great cotton exchanges\r\nare located at New Orleans and New York, the quotations on these\r\nmarkets controlling the financial transactions in cotton throughout the\r\nworld. The principal wool markets are Boston, New York, Philadelphia\r\nand St. Louis. The principal tobacco markets are at Richmond and\r\nDanville, Va., Durham, N. C., and Louisville, Ky.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. C. W.

One son was a student in\r\nagriculture at the Pennsylvania State College. Father and three sons,\r\nbeginning six years ago with a run-down farm of 55 acres, have built an\r\nacre of glass and a heating plant of 260 horsepower. During the period\r\nthey have spent $5,000 on the place and at the end of season they will\r\nhave very nearly cleared their improvements. \"Tell the youthful\r\nreaders of your book to get as much education as possible and then go in\r\npartnership with their fathers or brothers. If they do, success will be\r\ntheirs.\"]\r\n\r\nThe country shipper or the young farmer wishing to place his products\r\nin the ordinary channels of trade must consider and determine among\r\nother things the following: What cities have favorable markets for his\r\nproducts; choose some commission man or broker to handle them;\r\ncalculate the expenses for freight, commission and other customary\r\nitems; familiarize himself with the rules for grading his products in\r\nthe market or markets under consideration; and determine what agency\r\nthere may be for protecting him as to the weight and quality when\r\nsales are effected. Whenever practicable, a visit to the market in\r\nquestion and a personal study of the conditions under which selling is\r\ndone will be wise. Having done so, and perhaps having made a number of\r\nsales through these usual channels of trade, he will be in a position\r\nto consider whether he may organize to advantage some more direct\r\nmethod of getting his products to the consumer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n                       LAWS AFFECTING LAND AND\r\n                                LABOR\r\n\r\n\r\nThus far property has been treated as invested capital upon which\r\ninterest must be charged in determining the labor income. Labor,\r\nlikewise, has been considered principally in its effect upon profits.\r\nSociety has thrown around the transfer of property and the use of\r\nlabor certain restraints for the protection of all individuals.\r\n\r\nThrough the ages certain procedures have become fixed by custom. These\r\nlegal practices are largely the inheritance of old Roman law and are\r\nusually known as common law. Various legislative bodies having\r\njurisdiction enact from time to time other laws. This body of enacted\r\nlaw is called statute law and is much more variable than common law.\r\nIn the briefest possible manner it is the purpose here to state a few\r\nof the principles and applications of the law, chiefly the common law,\r\nas it affects the farmer in acquiring or disposing of his property and\r\nin his dealings with labor.\r\n\r\n                              PROPERTY\r\n\r\nProperty may be defined as anything which is a subject of ownership.\r\nIt possesses the characteristics of being acquired, held, sold, willed\r\nor inherited and is of two kinds: (1) Real property, real estate or\r\nrealty; (2) chattels or personal property. These two kinds of property\r\nare subject to quite distinct legal practices. In general, real estate\r\nconsists of land, things attached to it, such as trees, buildings,\r\nfences and certain rights and profits arising out of or annexed to the\r\nland. The term land as ordinarily used includes all these things, so\r\nthat when land is said to be worth so much an acre it includes all\r\nfixtures. Ponds and streams are, under this definition, land. The land\r\nnot only has surface dimensions, but extends upward indefinitely and\r\ndown to the center of the earth, and hence includes a right to ores,\r\ncoal, oil, gas or other materials whatsoever.\r\n\r\nAn article may, however, be real property or personal property\r\ndepending upon circumstances. Thus a tree growing on the land is real\r\nproperty, but when cut into cord wood becomes personal property. New\r\nfence posts ready for use are personal property. When set in the\r\nground they become real estate. Just what goes with a farm or what are\r\nfixtures is frequently a subject for legal determination.\r\n\r\n                              FIXTURES\r\n\r\nThe general rule is that \"fixtures are any chattels which have become\r\nsubstantially and permanently annexed to the land or to buildings or\r\nother things which are clearly a part of the land.\"[D] The annexation\r\nmay, however, be purely theoretical, since the keys to the house or\r\nbarn, which may be in the owner's pocket, are real estate. One rule\r\nconcerning fixtures is that they must be so annexed that they cannot\r\nbe severed without injuring the freehold. The intention of the party\r\nmaking the annexation also often determines, since if the article is\r\nannexed with the intention of making it permanent, it then becomes a\r\npart of the land. Among the things held to be fixtures, and therefore\r\na part of the land, are: (1) All buildings and everything which is a\r\npart of any building, such as doors, blinds, keys, etc.; (2) fence\r\nmaterials which have been once used and are piled up to be used again\r\nare a part of the land, but new fence material not yet used is\r\npersonal property. (3) Growing crops are real property. They go to the\r\npurchaser of the land unless specially reserved in the deed. A verbal\r\nagreement is not sufficient. (4) Trees, if blown down or cut down and\r\nstill lying where they fell, are real property; if cut or corded up\r\nfor sale they become personal property. (5) All manure made on the\r\nfarm is real estate and passes with the land. (6) All the ordinary\r\nportable machines and tools are considered personal property, but\r\ncertain machines held to be of permanent use upon the land are real\r\nestate. Among the things which courts have held to go with the land\r\nare cotton gins, copper kettles encased in brick and mortar for\r\ncooking food for hogs, cider mills, pumps, water pipes bringing water\r\nfrom distant springs. In general, motive power machinery and the\r\nshafting go with the land, but the machinery impelled may or may not,\r\ndepending upon the way it is annexed. (7) If stones have been quarried\r\nfor the purpose of using upon the farm, they go with the farm, but if\r\nquarried for sale they are personal property.\r\n\r\n                              CONTRACTS\r\n\r\nThe difference between personal property and real property may be\r\nindicated by considering the essential features of a contract. A\r\ncontract is an agreement between two or more persons. The foundation\r\nrule concerning a contract is that every man must fulfill every\r\nagreement he makes. An ethical practice grows out of this legal rule\r\nwhich, if strictly adhered to, will save much embarrassment, viz.,\r\nmake but few promises and always keep your engagements.\r\n\r\nThere are seven requirements generally necessary to a valid contract.\r\n(1) Possibility. The thing to be done must be possible. (2) Legality.\r\nIt must not be forbidden by law. (3) Proper parties. The parties to a\r\ncontract must be competent. Contracts with idiots or drunken persons\r\nare not binding. Some contracts with minors are not binding, although\r\ncontracts for the necessities of life are. (4) Mutual assent. A\r\nproposition not assented to by both parties is not binding on either.\r\n(5) Valid consideration. A man is not regarded as injured by the\r\nbreaking of a promise for which he has paid, or is to pay, nothing.\r\n(6) Fraud or deceit. A contract obtained by fraud is void as against\r\nthe party using the fraud, but may be enforced by the innocent party\r\nif he sees fit. (7) Written contracts. Here comes the most important\r\ndifference between real and personal property. Real property can only\r\nbe conveyed by a written instrument, properly executed and recorded,\r\nwhile personal property passes by mere possession. Contracts relating\r\nto the sale of real estate are not binding unless in writing, while\r\nverbal contracts are sufficient for personal property if accompanied\r\nby payment of a part of the purchase price or the acceptance of the\r\ngoods. For amounts under $50 verbal agreement in itself is binding.\r\n\r\n                       TRANSFER OF REAL ESTATE\r\n\r\nThe purchaser should require of the seller evidence that the title to\r\nthe land is straight and clear; if not, exactly what the defects are.\r\nThis is done through an abstract of title, which should be prepared by\r\na competent lawyer. This is not an official document, and its value\r\ndepends largely upon the ability and watchfulness of the party making\r\nthe abstract. Ownership of land is conveyed by means of a deed. A deed\r\nis an instrument conveying at least a life interest in the land. Care\r\nshould be taken that the deed contains the essential parts and that it\r\nis properly executed.\r\n\r\n                                DEEDS\r\n\r\nDeeds are of two kinds: Quit claim deeds, which convey all the rights,\r\ntitle and interest which the seller has in the land, but does not\r\nwarrant the title; and warranty deeds, which, in addition to what a\r\nquit claim does, contain covenants which agree that the seller and his\r\nheirs, etc., shall warrant and defend the title to the purchaser\r\nagainst the lawful claims of all persons.\r\n\r\n                      THE REQUISITES OF A DEED\r\n\r\nThe requisites of a deed are: The parties to the deed, the\r\nconsideration, the description; and with a warranty deed, the\r\ncovenants. The seller must be of full age, sound mind and if married\r\nhis wife should always join in the deed. Her name should appear\r\nfollowing his at the beginning of the instrument. She should sign and\r\nacknowledge the deed, and the certificate of acknowledgment should\r\nstate that she is the wife of the seller. If the seller is a married\r\nwoman, her husband does not need to join in the sale of her own\r\nproperty. It is customary to state the consideration upon which the\r\ndeed is given, but this is not necessary, nor will a false statement\r\nas to the amount paid invalidate the deed.\r\n\r\nThe description of the land conveyed should be as minute and careful\r\nas possible, and preferably in the exact language of former deeds. In\r\ncase former description is in error, it should be referred to and\r\ncorrect description given. Where land is conveyed by metes and bounds,\r\nthis description governs, although it may not convey the number of\r\nacres of land stated. In describing boundaries the location of\r\nmonuments takes precedence of distances mentioned.\r\n\r\n                        EXECUTION OF THE DEED\r\n\r\nA deed must be signed, witnessed, acknowledged, delivered and\r\nrecorded. In some states deeds must be sealed, but in other states the\r\nlaw has dispensed with this formality. Witnesses to deeds are not\r\nrequired in all states. Some states require one, but usually two\r\nwitnesses are required. The parties signing the deed are required to\r\nappear before an official designated by statute, usually any\r\nmagistrate, justice or notary public, and acknowledge the same to be\r\nhis or her free act and deed.\r\n\r\nA deed has no effect until delivered, and should be immediately\r\nrecorded by the purchaser. Generally an unrecorded deed is not good as\r\nagainst a subsequent purchaser in good faith. It is well to note that\r\nthe laws relating to the transfer of land are those of the place where\r\nthe land lies and not necessarily those of the place where the deed is\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n                  METHOD OF LAYING OUT PUBLIC LANDS\r\n\r\nThe public lands of the United States are, whenever practicable, laid\r\nout into townships each six miles square, \"as near as may be,\" whose\r\nsides run due north and south and east and west. The townships are\r\nlaid off north and south of a base line which is a parallel of\r\nlatitude, and are numbered north and south from the base line: Thus,\r\nT. 3 S., means Township No. 3 south from the base line. Each row of\r\ntownships running north and south is called a range, and is numbered\r\neast or west of the principal meridian: Thus, R. 2 E., means Range 2\r\neast of the given meridian.\r\n\r\nThe townships are then laid off into sections or square miles of 640\r\nacres, \"as near as may be,\" and these are numbered, beginning always\r\nat the northeast section, as shown in the accompanying diagram.\r\n\r\n                     N\r\n      +-----------------------------+\r\n      |  6 |  5 |  4 |  3 |  2 |  1 |\r\n      |----+----+----+----+----+----|\r\n      |  7 |  8 |  9 | 10 | 11 | 12 |\r\n      |----+----+----+----+----+----|\r\n    W | 18 | 17 | 16 | 15 | 14 | 13 | E\r\n      |----+----+----+----+----+----|\r\n      | 19 | 20 | 21 | 22 | 23 | 24 |\r\n      |----+----+----+----+----+----|\r\n      | 30 | 29 | 28 | 27 | 26 | 25 |\r\n      |----+----+----+----+----+----|\r\n      | 31 | 32 | 33 | 34 | 35 | 36 |\r\n      +-----------------------------+\r\n                     S\r\n\r\nEach quarter section is referred to as the northeast or southwest\r\nquarter of the section, and each forty acres as the northwest or\r\nsoutheast quarter of a particular quarter. For example, an eighty-acre\r\nfield may be referred to as the west half of the southwest quarter of\r\nSection 3, Township 5 North, Range 3, west of ----. Base line and\r\nmeridian, or in some cases merely the meridian is mentioned.\r\n\r\nThe curvature of the earth's surface makes it impossible for the sides\r\nof townships to be truly north and south and at the same time six\r\nmiles square. The excesses and the deficiencies due to the convergency\r\nof meridians and the curvature of the earth are by law added to or\r\ndeducted from the western and northern ranges of sections and half\r\nsections of the townships. While the above has been the rule in laying\r\nout public lands for more than a century, there are many exceptions,\r\ndue to many causes.\r\n\r\nIn the older settled sections the land was laid out in lots, often in\r\na very irregular manner, although in some cases within a given tract\r\nthe area was more or less regular. In these cases, the land must be\r\ndescribed minutely and carefully by metes and bounds. In some of the\r\nsouthern and western states, also, where there were Spanish grants,\r\nmuch irregularity in the surveys exists. Over much of the north\r\nCentral states this rectangular system of laying out lands obtains and\r\nhas worked well in most respects.\r\n\r\n                       THE LANDLORD AND TENANT\r\n\r\nLeases of real estate follow the same procedure as deeds, except that\r\na verbal lease, if for a term of not to exceed one year, is valid in\r\nmost states. A written lease should be carefully drawn, because,\r\naccording to common law, there are few things implied in a lease that\r\nare not stated. Definite statement concerning repairs and insurance is\r\ndesirable. A tenant should also acquaint himself with the law of the\r\nstate concerning the surrender of the farm upon the expiration of his\r\nterm.\r\n\r\nIt is the duty of the tenant not only to guard the property, but to\r\nconduct the farm in a husbandlike manner. Unless otherwise stated in\r\nthe contract, the tenant must pursue those methods of husbandry which\r\nare customary in the vicinity.\r\n\r\n                  THE RELATION OF THE FARMER TO HIS\r\n                               WORKMEN\r\n\r\nThe requirements of a valid contract, as previously stated, control\r\nmost of the relations which the employer has with his employees.\r\nContracts for labor, unless for more than one year, need not be in\r\nwriting. If, however, the service to be rendered is unusual, the\r\nagreement should be reduced to writing, because, in the absence of\r\nspecific agreement, the law assumes that customary service and wages\r\nare implied.\r\n\r\nLike all other employers of labor the farmer is under obligation to\r\nprotect his workman from injury. He must not subject them to unusual\r\nand unreasonable risks. He must hire workmen suited to the employment.\r\nFor example, if he employs a young boy to drive a fractious horse, he\r\nwould be liable for any injury that might occur. In like manner, he\r\nmust exercise proper care concerning the safety of the machinery\r\nplaced in the hands of his workmen. He must keep his premises in a\r\nsafe condition and must not expose his workmen to risks not incident\r\nto the employment for which they are hired.\r\n\r\nThe farmer is liable in damages for the acts of his workmen which are\r\nwithin the scope of their employment, although the authority may not\r\nhave been expressly conferred. \"He who acts by another acts himself.\"\r\nIn case one is sued for the acts of his employee, the burden is upon\r\nhim to prove that the act of the workman was without authority,\r\nexpressed or implied.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n  [D] Haigh's \"Manual of Law,\" p. 69.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n                          RURAL LEGISLATION\r\n\r\n\r\nVarious laws have been enacted by federal and state legislatures for the\r\nbetter protection of producer and consumer. Much of this legislation\r\naffects in a very special way the interests of the farmer. Not\r\ninfrequently, in fact, generally, the state department of agriculture\r\nhas more or less direct jurisdiction over their enforcement. State\r\ndepartments of agriculture usually publish a collection of the laws of\r\nthis character. These laws vary greatly in the different states and only\r\nthe most general outline, as they affect the interests of the farmer,\r\ncan be given here. Persons can inform themselves as to the details as\r\nenforced in a given state by applying to the state secretary of\r\nagriculture.\r\n\r\nA number of these acts affect interstate commerce, concerning which\r\nthe United States Constitution says: \"No state shall, without the\r\nconsent of the Congress, lay any impost or duties on imports or\r\nexports, except what may be absolutely necessary for executing its\r\ninspection laws.\" By a series of judicial decisions it has been\r\ndetermined that a State has a right to enforce laws affecting\r\ninterstate commerce when traffic in the articles thus modified or\r\nprohibited affects the public welfare. When it is necessary to have a\r\npolice regulation to prevent fraud in the traffic of an article or for\r\nthe purpose of guarding the public health or morals, police laws, so\r\ncalled, may be enacted and enforced. Around this general question\r\nthere has waged a bitter controversy which has occupied some of the\r\nbest legal minds and is one involving some difficulty.\r\n\r\n                         FERTILIZER CONTROL\r\n\r\nOne of the first of the \"control\" measures to be enacted, and the one\r\nwhich has been most universally adopted by the several states, is the\r\nlaw requiring the manufacturer and dealer in commercial fertilizers to\r\nguarantee the percentage of the so-called essential fertilizing\r\nelements--nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium--contained in each bag of\r\nfertilizer offered for sale. Subsequent control laws have been modeled\r\nmore or less closely after this law. Hence a description of the\r\noperation and execution of it will serve for all.\r\n\r\nThe execution of this law is usually under the immediate supervision\r\nof the state secretary of agriculture, while the necessary chemical\r\nanalyses are made by the state experiment station. In some states the\r\nenforcement of the law is in charge of the state experiment station,\r\nwhile in others the state department of agriculture has its own\r\nlaboratories or employs a private chemist. It is, however, becoming a\r\nmore and more settled policy to place all police regulations in charge\r\nof the state department of agriculture, while at the same time the\r\nchemical analyses and other scientific and technological inquiries are\r\nmade at the state experiment station.\r\n\r\nIn order to facilitate the taking of samples and in order to raise\r\nfunds for the execution of the law, the manufacturer is required to\r\ntake out a license and to make a statement of the brands of fertilizers\r\nwhich he will place upon the market in the given state during the given\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nDuring the spring and fall season agents traverse the state and sample\r\nthe bags of fertilizers as found on sale by local merchants. The\r\nsamples are sent by number under seal to the designated chemist, while\r\nat the same time the agent transmits to the state officer in charge of\r\nthe enforcement of the law the necessary information concerning these\r\nsamples. Upon the receipt of the analysis made by the chemist, who has\r\nhad no knowledge of the origin of the sample, the state officer\r\ncompares them with the guarantee of the manufacturer, and if he finds\r\nit necessary enters legal complaint. While these laws have been in\r\nforce for many years in some states and in many states for some years,\r\nprosecution has seldom been found necessary. The honest manufacturer is\r\nprotected from dishonest competition, and the dishonest manufacturer,\r\nif there be such, cannot afford the publicity which noncompliance with\r\nthe law would entail.\r\n\r\nIt has been customary to publish, with the results of analysis, also\r\nan estimate of the commercial value per ton of each brand of\r\nfertilizer. This estimated commercial value is obtained by multiplying\r\nthe pounds of each element or combinations of the element in a ton by\r\na value per pound. To the value of the fertilizer thus obtained is\r\nadded something for cost of mixing, bagging and freight, and something\r\nfor profit. The price per pound given to each element or combinations\r\nof the elements is based upon the commercial value of the element when\r\npurchased in raw materials. The price for each year is usually\r\ndetermined by a conference of those in control of the execution of the\r\nlaw in the several states for certain groups of states. As a matter of\r\nfact, the price varies little from year to year.\r\n\r\nThe published figures, therefore, constitute a table of comparative\r\ncommercial values as determined by the most expert knowledge. While\r\nnot constituting a statement of absolute commercial value for any\r\ngiven locality, they do enable the purchaser to determine whether the\r\nprice quoted on a given brand of fertilizer is within reason. Persons\r\nwho are unacquainted with the principles controlling the use of\r\ncommercial fertilizers may, however, be led to believe that the price\r\nof the fertilizer is an indication of its value for the production of\r\na given crop. As is well known to all students of the subject, there\r\nis no necessary relation between the commercial value of a fertilizer\r\nand the fitness of its formula for a given soil and crop. For these\r\nand other reasons, the publication of tables of commercial value has\r\nbeen strongly opposed by some manufacturers, and in certain states the\r\ncustom has been discontinued. While granting that tables of commercial\r\nvalue are subject to misinterpretation, it is perhaps fair to say that\r\nsuch tables have been of most benefit, and, moreover, have been of\r\ngreat value to those who were most likely to misinterpret them.\r\n\r\nIt has been customary in most states to make analyses only of mixed\r\nfertilizers. Thus such raw materials as nitrate of soda, sulphate of\r\nammonia, dried blood, bone meal, rock phosphate, tankage, muriate of\r\npotash, sulphate of potash, have not been brought under the operation\r\nof the law. If one wishes to purchase nitrate of soda, muriate of\r\npotash and tankage with the intention of mixing them according to a\r\nformula of his own, he may not find any protection in his state.\r\nHowever, these products can be obtained through reputable dealers who\r\nwill willingly guarantee the contents. In case of doubt, the purchaser\r\nmay secure an analysis by his state experiment station at a moderate\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nThe law requires that there shall be affixed to every package of\r\nfertilizer offered for sale a statement about as follows:\r\n\r\n  The minimum per centum of each of the following constituents\r\n  which may be contained therein:\r\n\r\n  (a) Nitrogen.\r\n\r\n  (b) Soluble, available and total phosphoric acid, except in\r\n  cases of undissolved bone, basic slag phosphate, wood ashes,\r\n  unheated phosphate rock, garbage tankage and pulverized natural\r\n  manures, when the minimum per centum of total phosphoric acid\r\n  may be substituted. This latter applies only in those states\r\n  where raw materials are subject to inspection.\r\n\r\n  (c) Potash soluble in distilled water.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to comply with the law and yet state the guarantee upon\r\neach bag of fertilizer in such a manner as to mislead the uninformed.\r\nIt is not the purpose of this book to deal with such technical\r\ndetails, but if the purchaser of commercial fertilizers is not already\r\nwell acquainted with fertilizer terms, he should secure an elementary\r\ntextbook on the subject or write to his state experiment station for a\r\nbulletin discussing them.\r\n\r\n                        FEEDING STUFF CONTROL\r\n\r\nThe law controlling the sale of stock foods is of more recent origin\r\nthan the fertilizer control act and has not been so universally\r\nadopted up to the present time. The necessity for such a law arises\r\nfrom the growing use as stock foods of various by-products in the\r\nmanufacture of liquors, starch, glucose, sugar, cottonseed and linseed\r\noils and breakfast foods. Various mixtures, varying widely in chemical\r\ncomposition, especially in protein and crude fiber, were placed upon\r\nthe market. In some instances mixtures were grossly adulterated with\r\nsuch things as oat hulls and ground corn cobs.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of this law by certain states has served to make other\r\nstates the dumping ground for inferior stock foods, thus increasing\r\nthe necessity for similar protection. The law does not apply to the\r\nordinary grains produced by farmers or to the usual by-products of\r\nmillers.\r\n\r\n                            SEED CONTROL\r\n\r\nFrom time immemorial it has been the universal custom of seedsmen to\r\ndisclaim all responsibility for the purity and germinating power of\r\ntheir seeds. But as the importance of good seed--good in hereditary\r\npower, good in germination, good in its freedom from adulteration, good\r\nin its absence of noxious weed seed--has become better understood demand\r\nfor some method of control has arisen. In at least one state there is a\r\nseed-control law modeled quite closely after the fertilizer-control law.\r\nHowever, the usual method of protection consists in purchasing by sample\r\nor the insistence of a guarantee, with a subsequent \"analysis\" of a\r\nsample of the purchased seed.\r\n\r\nThe germinating power and purity of seed can be determined cheaply by\r\nan expert within from five to twenty days, depending upon the species.\r\nThe federal government has a division of seed control in its\r\nDepartment of Agriculture at Washington, D. C. Any person may send a\r\nsample of seed to this division and have its purity and germinating\r\npower determined, and in some of the states the experiment station\r\nwill perform similar services without charge. Clover, alfalfa, grass\r\nand other small seeds should always be purchased subject to such\r\ninspection, unless the purchaser is prepared to make his own\r\ninspection, which a very little training makes possible.\r\n\r\n                         NURSERY INSPECTION\r\n\r\nThere is no national law concerning the importation of insect-infested\r\nor diseased plant stock.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the states have passed both state and interstate regulations\r\nconcerning the sale of nursery stock. The insects usually legislated\r\nagainst are San Jose scale, gypsy moth and brown-tail moth, while the\r\ndiseases usually interdicted are yellows, black knot, peach rosette,\r\nand pear blight.\r\n\r\nThe enforcement of the law is usually placed in charge of a person\r\nhaving special knowledge of economic insects and fungous diseases. In\r\naddition to these police regulations this officer may, by various\r\nmeans, attempt to bring into practice methods calculated to eradicate\r\nor, at least, lessen the severity of existing attacks.\r\n\r\nCommerce in vinegar, dried fruits, insecticides and fungicides is also\r\nregulated in some states.\r\n\r\n                   DAIRY, FOOD AND DRUG INSPECTION\r\n\r\nAn adequate discussion of the rise and development of the control in\r\nthe sale of dairy and food products would require a chapter by itself,\r\nif not an entire volume. Suffice it to say here that the laws on this\r\ngeneral subject have acquired an importance in many ways quite beyond\r\nthat of any of the other control measures discussed in this chapter.\r\nIn the extent of funds handled, the number of agents employed and the\r\npublic interest incited, the office of dairy and food commissioner\r\noutranks any other control agency. In some states the office is an\r\nelective one, and the questions with which the office has to deal\r\nbecome a part of the state political campaign.\r\n\r\nThe importance of the inspection of dairy and food products grows out\r\nof the fact that not only is the consumer, hence all the world,\r\ninterested, but the execution of these laws touch large commercial\r\ninterests. Not only are meat packers, distillers and brewers deeply\r\ninterested, but the wholesale and retail grocers and, more recently,\r\nthe manufacturing and prescribing druggists, are vitally concerned.\r\n\r\nNot many years ago the inspection of dairy products, particularly\r\ncontrol of the traffic in oleomargarine, was the chief function of\r\nthis office. To-day the enforcement of laws concerning pure foods,\r\nliquor and drugs is of much greater importance.\r\n\r\nInterstate commerce in oleomargarine is now regulated through the\r\nenactment of an internal revenue law requiring a tax of ten cents a\r\npound on colored oleomargarine and one-fourth of a cent a pound on\r\nuncolored oleomargarine and, further, by prescribing the character of\r\npackage and method of marking all oleomargarine entering into\r\ninterstate commerce. State agencies are charged with the duty of\r\nrequiring the compliance of local dealers and restaurateurs with the\r\ngeneral features of the federal law. Some states, however, prohibit\r\nentirely the sale of colored oleomargarine within the state.\r\n\r\n                      PURITY IN DAIRY PRODUCTS\r\n\r\nAttempts to define what is pure milk, cream, butter or cheese have been\r\nfraught with much difficulty. Thus, for example, legal definitions of\r\npure milk have resulted in some cows giving illegal milk. In some\r\ninstances the law has declared simply that whole milk is milk from\r\nwhich no cream has been removed; in others, the minimum amount of\r\nbutter fat has been prescribed; in still others, the minimum amount of\r\ntotal solids containing a minimum proportion of butter fat has been\r\nmade the basis of legal milk. In like manner full cream cheese has been\r\ndefined as cheese made from whole milk or from milk from which only a\r\ngiven amount of cream has been removed, while in other instances the\r\nminimum amount of butter fat which full cream cheese may contain is\r\nprescribed. The wide variation in the amount of butter fat carried by\r\ncream has caused much jocular comment and some serious discussion as to\r\nwhat is cream.\r\n\r\nWhile it is not feasible to indicate the laws for the several states,\r\nthe ruling of the federal government as to what constitutes purity in\r\ndairy products under the national food and drug act may be accepted as\r\na general guide. A circular giving the required information may be\r\nsecured by addressing the Secretary of Agriculture, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n                        LIVE STOCK SANITATION\r\n\r\nThe control of contagious diseases in domestic animals and the\r\ninspection of meat products have been the chief work of the Bureau of\r\nAnimal Industry of the United States Department of Agriculture since\r\nits establishment.\r\n\r\nThe bureau inspects all imported live animals and under certain\r\nconditions will inspect live animals intended for exportation. It\r\ninspects all meat products intended for export. Its inspection of\r\nmeats intended for interstate commerce is less rigid than that\r\nexported. Meats sold within the state in which they are slaughtered\r\ncannot be required by the federal government to undergo inspection. It\r\nthus happens that the people of the several states enjoy less\r\nprotection in the consumption of meat than the foreign purchaser of\r\nAmerican meats unless there is a state meat inspection law. However,\r\nit is becoming more and more the custom for the large packers to have\r\nall their products inspected without regard to their destination. The\r\nmeats slaughtered in the locality in which they are consumed are the\r\nones that receive the least supervision.\r\n\r\nThe federal government has been especially active and efficient in the\r\nprevention of interstate commerce in cattle suffering with Texas\r\nfever, and sheep attacked with scab and foot rot. Through the agency\r\nof the bureau dipping tanks have been provided in all the great live\r\nstock markets for the disinfection of cattle and sheep when needed.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the states have laws controlling the importation of\r\ndiseased animals from other states and the transfer of them within the\r\nstate. The following are the diseases most commonly mentioned in the\r\nlaws of the several states: Anthrax, black quarter, hog cholera, swine\r\nplague, rabies, glanders and tuberculosis. The law is generally\r\nenforced by a state veterinarian, whose acts are supervised either by\r\na state live stock commission or the state secretary of agriculture or\r\nthese two agencies acting conjointly.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the disease which has required the greatest amount of\r\nattention in the several states is tuberculosis in milch cows. It is\r\ncustomary for this office to apply the tuberculin test, free of\r\ncharge, under certain stipulations, to any herd upon the request of\r\nthe owner and to supervise the slaughter and disposition of the\r\nreacting animals. In some states the owner is indemnified in part or\r\nin whole for his loss. The amount of indemnity as well as the general\r\nfeatures of the law concerning the control of tuberculosis in domestic\r\nanimals has been the subject of much controversy and cannot be said to\r\nhave reached an altogether satisfactory solution in most states.\r\n\r\nThe young farmer should clearly understand that under no circumstances\r\ncan he afford to have a tuberculous animal in his herd. The contact of\r\na diseased animal with other animals of the herd is certain to entail\r\na greater loss than the destruction of the diseased animal. The farmer\r\nmust in his own interest rear healthy animals whether or not it is\r\nnecessary for the protection of the consumer.\r\n\r\n                         FISH AND GAME LAWS\r\n\r\nThe motives underlying the enactment of laws concerning fish and game\r\nare varied. The controversies over these laws in the legislatures of\r\nthe several states indicate that there is a belief, whatever may be\r\nthe fact, that there are opposing interests; viz., those of the hunter\r\nor sportsman on the one hand, and those of the farmer or landowner on\r\nthe other. The law of trespass has been one over which has raged much\r\nbitterness, both with regard to the form of the law to be enacted and\r\nconcerning its subsequent enforcement. Sportsmen have usually held\r\nthat a distinction existed between wild animals occupying private\r\nproperty and domestic animals. The landowner has urged that others\r\nshould not trespass upon his property for the purpose of shooting wild\r\nanimals, although his proprietary right in them was no greater.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, laws concerning the closed season, made to protect\r\nanimals during the breeding period, are the subject of extended\r\ndiscussion and are being constantly changed; both because there is a\r\ndifference of opinion concerning the habits of the different species\r\nand because the motive varies for maintaining the supply. Some animals\r\nare protected on account of their benefit, supposed or real, to\r\nagriculture. Other animals are protected because of their gaming\r\nqualities, even to the extent of sometimes injuring farm crops. The\r\nmoney spent by sportsmen in the pursuit of game is an element in the\r\nvaried interests involved. Humane motives and a desire to prevent the\r\nfurther restriction of a not too varied fauna have helped, also, to\r\nsave certain species from extinction. On the other hand, in some\r\nstates commercial interests are involved, as where large quantities of\r\nbirds are taken for their plumage.\r\n\r\nSome attempts have been made to introduce foreign species, as the\r\nJapanese pheasant. It is, however, with fish that the most has been\r\naccomplished in replenishment. The federal government and several of\r\nthe states have been active in regularly restocking, each season,\r\ncertain streams with \"fry\" of edible and game fish.\r\n\r\nInformation concerning the open season can be obtained from the proper\r\nstate officer. The fish and game laws are usually under the control of\r\na commission with a secretary as the executive officer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                             CHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n                             RURAL FORCES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe United States is a vast domain. Its material resources are\r\nenormous. Its fertile and easily tilled soil, its magnificent forests,\r\nits great stores of ore, coal, oil and gas; its fine water-power sites\r\nand its temperate and healthful climate have all contributed to the\r\nmaking of a prosperous and progressive nation. Without these natural\r\nresources the United States could not be what it is.\r\n\r\nThe waste of some of these resources is almost beyond belief. In\r\nmining, one-half the anthracite and one-third the soft coal is left in\r\nthe ground in such a manner that it may never be economically\r\nrecovered. A ton of coal will produce 1,400 pounds of coke, worth\r\n$1.50, and 20 pounds of sulphate of ammonia, worth 50 cents. If all\r\nthe nitrogen in coal which is turned into coke in Pennsylvania were\r\nrecovered, it would furnish enough of this element to supply the needs\r\nof every acre of tillable soil in that state. Only about 44% of the\r\nwood in the trees now harvested in the United States is incorporated\r\ninto buildings, apparatus and furniture. The rest is wasted in the\r\nprocess of cutting, sawing and manufacturing into the finished\r\nproducts.\r\n\r\nFacts like these have led the nation to realize that the conservation\r\nof our natural resources is an immediate and pressing problem. The\r\nUnited States has, however, a greater inheritance than these great and\r\nbeneficent gifts of nature and a more fundamental problem than the\r\npreservation and efficient use of them. In a single sentence, the\r\ngreatest inheritance of the American people is their Puritan ancestry.\r\nThe word Puritan is here used to apply not only to the New England\r\nPilgrims, but to all our early forefathers, whose traditions and\r\npractices have served to set this country apart from the other\r\ncountries of the world. Because of the traditions which have been\r\nhanded down to us, we are healthier-bodied and cleaner-minded men and\r\nwomen. We are more efficient, not merely in making money, but in\r\neverything that goes to make a full and well-rounded life.\r\n\r\nIt is well to realize the resources of other nations. The agricultural\r\npossibilities of France appear to the casual observer to compare\r\nfavorably with any equal area in the United States. One may see farm\r\nland in Italy which has been cultivated for at least two thousand\r\nyears which is evidently as fertile as any of the limestone valleys of\r\nthe Atlantic States, the prairies of the Mississippi valley or the\r\nPalouse district of the Northwest. Russia has enormous areas of\r\nfertile soil. Careful observers report that in Manchuria there are\r\ngreat stretches of country, which today possess natural opportunities\r\nsimilar to those which the Mississippi valley offered one hundred\r\nyears ago. The recent stories of the deposits of coal and mineral\r\nwealth in China are almost fabulous. Europe has rich mines, great\r\nforests and unrivaled water-power.\r\n\r\nSome years ago a native of Argentina and a native of the United States\r\nwere dining together. The Argentinian had served his government as\r\nconsul to Canada. He related that he had recently written an official\r\nletter in which he had occasion to refer to the people of Canada and to\r\nthose of this country. He explained that in alluding to the former he\r\ncould say the Canadians, but the latter he could not call Americans,\r\nsince his people were also Americans. After due consideration he\r\nreferred to us as \"the Yankees.\" \"But,\" turning to his hearer, he said,\r\nwith great emphasis, \"I do not look upon the people of the United\r\nStates as a nation, but as a new civilization.\" In other words, our\r\nnation is not simply one of fertile farms, enormous mines, great\r\nforests, unparalleled railroad systems, palatial stores, or wealthy\r\ncities, but he saw that we are a people of different economic,\r\npolitical, educational, social, moral and religious ideals.\r\n\r\nThere are in every rural neighborhood certain forces whose objects are\r\nto increase the educational advantages, the social opportunities and\r\nthe moral aspirations of the people. This subject need not be\r\ndiscussed merely in the abstract. There are in every community\r\nconcrete evidences of these forces. There is the rural church. There\r\nis the rural school. In many localities are to be found, also,\r\nbuildings, for social and fraternal purposes, as grange halls,\r\nstructures for holding fairs and picnics. These are tangible evidences\r\nthat there are rural agencies at work in the community whose chief\r\npurpose is to increase the educational advantages, the social\r\nopportunities and the moral aspirations of the people.\r\n\r\nHow are these existing rural forces to be made more effective? If\r\nco-operation in financial affairs is essential under modern conditions,\r\nit is more needed in social matters. Such co-operation does not imply\r\nthat these separate forces shall be fused into a single one. Each of\r\nthem has its particular and peculiar work to do, but each should work\r\nin harmony and not in the spirit of antagonism with the others.\r\n\r\nThere should be formed in each locality a committee for which the\r\nfollowing name is proposed: The Community Committee of Rural Forces.\r\nEmphasis should be placed upon the word \"community.\" Like all moral\r\nmovements, progress must come from within, and not from without. The\r\nmovement must be adapted to its environment. Like the plants that grow\r\nthere, it must be indigenous to the soil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jared Van Wagenen, Jr., has a son Jared, 3d, who is the\r\nfifth of the name that has lived upon a farm of 224 acres at Lawyerville,\r\nN. Y. Mr. Van Wagenen graduated from Cornell University in 1891, and is a\r\nnoted farmers' institute lecturer. He has taken great interest in the\r\ncountry church and the betterment of the rural community. The view shows\r\nthe pond that furnishes the power for the farm's electric light plant.\r\nThe plant was installed by Mr. Van Wagenen with his own hands and has\r\nproved a really satisfying success.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mr. Lowell B. Gable, Glen Gable Farms, Wybrooke, Pa.,\r\na graduate of Cornell University, is developing 812 acres of land in\r\nChester county. He has a herd of 80 Guernsey cows in milk and is breeding\r\nPercheron, registered polling horses and Chester White hogs. Mr. Gable\r\nhas been supervisor of the township for two years, during which time nine\r\nand one-half miles of macadam road have been built without materially\r\nincreasing the taxes. Mr. Gable firmly believes that one of the best\r\nopportunities to be of help to a rural community lies in the work to be\r\ndone for the improvement of social conditions--\"to help make what\r\nlittle leisure there is clean and refreshing.\" Hence on return from\r\ncollege he played baseball and football with local teams and helped out\r\nat every opportunity at dances, musicales and other social\r\nentertainments.]\r\n\r\nThis committee should be composed of representatives of the churches,\r\nthe schools, farmers' clubs, granges, fair associations, farmers'\r\ninstitutes; and other organizations which are striving to increase the\r\neducational advantages, the social opportunities and the moral\r\naspirations of the people.\r\n\r\nOftentimes the object of these rural forces is confused with efforts\r\nto increase the financial prosperity of the farmer. It goes without\r\nsaying that the maintenance of the fertility of the soil is essential\r\nto the food supply of the nation. The problems of the economic\r\nproduction of plants and animals are of great importance to the\r\nprosperity of the farmer. The idea, however, that the proper solution\r\nof these economic problems is to be the means of solving the\r\neducational, social and religious problems is simply putting the cart\r\nbefore the horse. Economic questions can only be satisfactorily\r\nadjusted through the application of intelligence and right ideas.\r\n\r\nLet it be supposed that when a young man decides to pay attention to a\r\nyoung woman that instead of meeting her at the church door, or it may\r\nbe at the railway station, it is considered better form for him to get\r\npermission of the mother to call upon the young woman in her own home.\r\nThis is the most fundamental question in every neighborhood. What has\r\nit to do with the price of wheat?\r\n\r\nThis illustration has been used to emphasize two points. First, there\r\nare many problems in every community that are in no way related to the\r\nmaterial prosperity of the neighborhood. Second, there is, at present,\r\nno single force in the community with sufficient influence to cope\r\nproperly with many of these problems.\r\n\r\nA young college graduate who is now managing eight hundred acres of land\r\nrecently wrote: \"I firmly believe that one of the best opportunities to\r\nbe of help to a rural community lies in the work that is to be done for\r\nthe improvement of social conditions--to help make what little leisure\r\nthere is clean and refreshing.\" Hence on return from college this young\r\nman has found time to play football and baseball with local teams and to\r\nhelp whenever opportunity offered at dances, musicales and similar\r\nentertainments. Games and other forms of recreation may be clean and\r\nwholesome, or they may be quite the reverse. It would be the duty of the\r\ncommunity committee to see that dances occurred under proper\r\nenvironment--not next an open saloon--and that the young women were\r\nproperly chaperoned.\r\n\r\nIn many communities the boys and girls are almost wholly dependent\r\nupon the neighboring towns for their amusement. This condition may or\r\nmay not be desirable. If the town and country are virtually one\r\ncommunity, there is every reason why the boys and girls from the farms\r\nshould find recreation and social intercourse with the boys and girls\r\nof the village. It is a relationship that should be fostered wherever\r\npossible. When, however, the town and the country are separate\r\ncommunities, which prevent the ordinary social relationships, it is\r\nusually unfortunate when the young people of the one community are\r\ndependent upon the other community for their amusements.\r\n\r\nA deeply earnest man recently said: \"I was born and raised upon the\r\nfarm. I never knew a dull day in my life. I went fishing. I went\r\nhunting and----\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop right there,\" said the listener. \"There is not the same\r\nopportunity today for a boy to go hunting that there was when you were\r\na boy.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our ideas about such things have changed, also.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he replied, humbly enough, for he was a man of fine fiber.\r\n\r\n\"I propose a substitute,\" said the listener. \"There is much more\r\npleasure and recreation to be obtained from photographing animals than\r\nfrom killing them. What is needed in every rural community is a camera\r\nclub.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a boy wishes to go hunting, he merely has to buckle on his\r\nammunition pouch, shoulder his gun and he is ready. A camera club,\r\nhowever, requires a social organization and a social center. The\r\ncommunity committee would thus be required to decide whether the\r\nfacilities for developing and printing pictures may best be located at\r\nthe church, the schoolhouse, the grange hall or elsewhere.\r\n\r\nA little reflection will show how many possibilities such a club might\r\nhave on its social, moral and educational side. The suggestion has\r\nbeen made here, however, only as an illustration of the problems which\r\narise when a rural community is organized for social welfare. The\r\norganization of a book club, or a magazine club in a rural community\r\npresents precisely the same problems. Some method must be devised for\r\nexchanging the books or magazines. Whether they are exchanged at the\r\nchurch, the grange hall or through the school children will depend\r\nupon local conditions requiring a community committee to decide.\r\n\r\nThis community committee will do something more than reach immediate\r\nresults. It may project its influence far into the future. Not all of\r\nlife is comprised in a porcelain bathtub and nickel adornments.\r\nNevertheless modern methods of heating and plumbing are desirable in\r\nthe country as well as in the city. In Indiana there is a one-room\r\nschool building. In the basement there has been placed a furnace and a\r\ngasoline engine. The engine is used not only to teach the boys how to\r\nrun a gasoline engine, but it makes possible a modern system of\r\nplumbing.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that many of the states within the past decade have\r\nvoted to abolish or very materially restrict the sale of alcoholic\r\nbeverages. No great temperance orators have roused the people as was\r\nthe case thirty years or more ago. Why, then, has such progress been\r\nmade in recent years? In large part because twenty-five years ago, the\r\nteaching of physiology was introduced into the public schools, which\r\ntaught the evil effects of alcohol to the human system. During the\r\npast decade young men who studied these physiologies have been voting.\r\n\r\nWhat has the teaching of physiology to do with the one-room schoolhouse\r\nin Indiana with its modern system of plumbing? The girls between the\r\nages of six and fourteen are now becoming accustomed to modern systems\r\nof plumbing. When they grow older and marry they will find some way to\r\nintroduce similar conveniences into their homes without regard to the\r\nprice of wheat. A wise community committee will find many ways to\r\ninfluence future generations. Such a committee would be a priceless\r\nheritage to any community.\r\n\r\nThe natural resources of the United States are necessary to the\r\nprosperity of the people. The preservation and economic use of these\r\nresources are of vast importance. The natural resources of the world\r\nwere, however, as great five thousand years ago as they are today. The\r\nsoil was no less fertile then than now. The difference between the\r\nprosperity of the human race at these two periods is caused by a\r\ndifference in human motive and efficiency. It is the result of ideals\r\nand knowledge. Sit at the banquet table with men who are the real\r\npowers in shaping the affairs of the world. The chances are that the\r\nchampagne remains untouched. These men are not in the habit of\r\npartaking of midnight suppers. They must keep themselves fit for the\r\nnext day's work. They have the approval and loyalty of their wives\r\nbecause they deserve it. In other words, the men who do the world's\r\nwork are not drunkards. They are not gluttons. They are not libertines.\r\nThey are efficient because they have healthy bodies and clean minds. It\r\nis this efficiency which the critic from Argentina saw when he said, \"I\r\ndo not look upon the people of the United States as a nation, but as a\r\nnew civilization.\"\r\n\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n                           STANDARD BOOKS\r\n\r\n                            PUBLISHED BY\r\n                         ORANGE JUDD COMPANY\r\n\r\n\r\n           NEW YORK                                CHICAGO\r\n       ASHLAND BUILDING                      People's Gas Building\r\n     315-321 Fourth Avenue                    150 Michigan Avenue\r\n\r\n                              ----------\r\n\r\n_Any of these books will be sent by mail, postpaid, to any part of the\r\nworld, on receipt of catalog price.

There is no subject of more vital importance to the\r\nfarmer than that of the best method of maintaining the fertility of the\r\nsoil. The very evident decrease in the fertility of those soils which\r\nhave been under cultivation for a number of years, combined with the\r\nincreased competition and the advanced price of labor, have convinced\r\nthe intelligent farmer that the agriculture of the future must be based\r\nupon more rational practices than those which have been followed in the\r\npast. We have felt for some time that there was a place for a brief,\r\nand at the same time comprehensive, treatise on this important subject\r\nof Soil Fertility. Professor Vivian's experience as a teacher in the\r\nshort winter courses has admirably fitted him to present this matter in\r\na popular style. In this little book he has given the gist of the\r\nsubject in plain language, practically devoid of technical and\r\nscientific terms. It is pre-eminently a \"First Book,\" and will be found\r\nespecially valuable to those who desire an introduction to the subject,\r\nand who intend to do subsequent reading.

A most helpful book to all farmers and\r\nstudents interested in the selection and improvement of corn. It is\r\nprofusely illustrated from photographs, all of which carry their own\r\nstory and contribute their part in making pictures and text matter a\r\nclear, concise and interesting study of corn.

This book covers fully the principles of\r\nbreeding and feeding for both fat stock and dairying type. It tells of\r\nsheep and mutton raising, hot house lambs, the swine industry and the\r\nhorse market. Finally, he tells of the preparation of stock for the\r\nmarket and how to prepare it so that it will bring a high market\r\nprice. Live stock is the most important feature of farm life, and\r\nstatistics show a production far short of the actual requirements.\r\nThere are many problems to be faced in the profitable production of\r\nstock, and these are fully and comprehensively covered in Mr. Shamel's\r\nnew book. Illustrated. 5x7 inches. 288 pages. Cloth.\r\n\r\n                                                           Net, $1.50\r\n\r\n=The Business of Dairying=\r\n\r\nBy C. B. LANE. The author of this practical little book is to be\r\ncongratulated on the successful manner in which he has treated so\r\nimportant a subject. It has been prepared for the use of dairy\r\nstudents, producers and handlers of milk, and all who make dairying a\r\nbusiness. Its purpose is to present in a clear and concise manner\r\nvarious business methods and systems which will help the dairyman to\r\nreap greater profits. This book meets the needs of the average dairy\r\nfarmer, and if carefully followed will lead to successful dairying. It\r\nmay also be used as an elementary textbook for colleges, and\r\nespecially in short-course classes. Illustrated. 5x7 inches. 300\r\npages.

This book is entirely different from the usual type\r\nof dairy books, and is undoubtedly in a class by itself. The entire\r\nsubject of butter-making in all its branches has been most thoroughly\r\ntreated, and many new and important features have been added. The\r\ntests for moisture, salt and acid have received special attention, as\r\nhave also the questions on cream separation, pasteurization,\r\ncommercial starters, cream ripening, cream overrun, marketing of\r\nbutter, and creamery management.

The most complete and popular work of the kind ever\r\npublished. As a rule, a book of this sort is dry and uninteresting,\r\nbut in this case it reads like a novel. The author has put into it his\r\nindividuality. The story of the properties of the soils, their\r\nimprovement and management, as well as a discussion of the problems of\r\ncrop growing and crop feeding, make this book equally valuable to the\r\nfarmer, student and teacher.

The enormous losses, amounting to several hundred\r\nmillion dollars annually in the United States, caused by weeds\r\nstimulate us to adopt a better system of agriculture. The weed\r\nquestion is, therefore, a most important and vital one for American\r\nfarmers. This treatise will enable the farmer to treat his field to\r\nremove weeds. The book is profusely illustrated by photographs and\r\ndrawings made expressly for this work, and will prove invaluable to\r\nevery farmer, land owner, gardener and park superintendent. 5x7\r\ninches. 300 pages.

Farm Machinery and Farm Motors is\r\nthe first American book published on the subject of Farm Machinery\r\nsince that written by J. J. Thomas in 1867. This was before the\r\ndevelopment of many of the more important farm machines, and the\r\ngeneral application of power to the work of the farm. Modern farm\r\nmachinery is indispensable in present-day farming operations, and a\r\npractical book like Farm Machinery and Farm Motors will fill a\r\nmuch-felt need. The book has been written from lectures used by the\r\nauthors before their classes for several years, and which were\r\nprepared from practical experience and a thorough review of the\r\nliterature pertaining to the subject. Although written primarily as a\r\ntextbook, it is equally useful for the practical farmer. Profusely\r\nillustrated. 5-1/2x8 inches. 520 pages.

This book comprises a complete study of\r\neverything pertaining to wheat. It is the work of a student of\r\neconomic as well as agricultural conditions, well fitted by the broad\r\nexperience in both practical and theoretical lines to tell the whole\r\nstory in a condensed form. It is designed for the farmer, the teacher,\r\nand the student as well.

D.=\r\n\r\n=_and_ CLARENCE BEAMAN SMITH, M. S.=\r\n\r\n_Associate Editors in the Office of Experiment Stations, United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture_\r\n\r\nThis is a new, practical, and complete presentation of the whole\r\nsubject of agriculture in its broadest sense. It is designed for the\r\nuse of agriculturists who desire up-to-date, reliable information on\r\nall matters pertaining to crops and stock, but more particularly for\r\nthe actual farmer. The volume contains\r\n\r\n    =Detailed directions for the culture of every important field,\r\n    orchard, and garden crop=\r\n\r\ngrown in America, together with descriptions of their chief insect\r\npests and fungous diseases, and remedies for their control.
